{START OF EPISODE 1}
Wait, I forgot!
- Who the hell is pregnant?
- What?
I found a pregnancy test at your cabin and I checked with all the girls over there and wasn't any of them.
Hello, darling, what a surprise.
Hey.
Can we talk?
Maybe in private.
You and me?
I believe she's referring to me, son.
Please excuse us.
So Iam pregnant.
I see.
I don't understand how.
We were so careful.
I warned you about this.
Standard birth control methods aren't usually effective against a Swanson.
I got about a million thoughts running around in my head, but I really just want to know what you're thinking.
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.
I was gonna wait until our anniversary, take you somewhere romantic, perhaps in a canoe-- most likely in a canoe.
I actually built a canoe for that purpose, but given the news, and given my significant feelings for you, now seems as good a time as any.
Ron Swanson.
Diane Lewis will you marry me?
Yes.
- On one condition.
- Anything, my love.
Ask me for anything in the world, and I'll give it to you, except a destination wedding.
Just the opposite.
We've both been married before.
I don't want anything big or elaborate.
In fact, the smaller the better.
I assume you can deal with that.
Are you kidding?
As far as I'm concerned, we could go up to the fourth floor right now.
Well, hello there.
Hey, Leslie.
What's with the getup?
We're coming back from cleaning up the Pawnee River.
There's nothing I love more than squeegeeing slime off a highway underpass.
Where are you guys going?
The fourth floor, getting married.
Okey-dokey.
Well, catch you later.
What?
Wha-- What--who's-- what the-- Are you dead?
You look like you're in rictus.
I just--I'm having so many thoughts and feelings that I'm paralyzed right now.
Would you ladies like to come?
- Can I be the best man?
- Why not?
Let's go.
Ron is getting married, and I love him, and I care about him, and this is the greatest day ever, and I do not have time to talk about this!
Wait!
If you would just slow down a little, then I could arrange balloons or a flower cake - or a bouncy castle-- - Ah!
Ethel Beavers, we would like a marriage license, please and thank you.
What's the date of the wedding?
- Today.
- It's a bit unusual, - but we both-- - Don't care.
Leslie Knope, would you please be my matron of honor?
Diane, you have no idea what that means to me.
She gets it.
Let's go.
Well, this is like a waking nightmare of happiness.
I need to get some flowers.
Why don't you hold this colorful bouquet of highlighters?
Rice, I need to find some rice, I need to throw some rice.
Why is there no rice in this municipal government building?
I found a justice guy.
These are the marrying people.
- This is Carl.
- Hello, Carl.
My fiancee and I would like to get married right now, right here.
Haven't I done a quickie wedding for you before?
It's certainly possible, but this one's going to stick.
I need your full names for the license.
- Ronald Ulysses Swanson.
- Diane Tammy Lewis.
Tammy?
- Your middle name is-- - Just kidding, it's Elizabeth.
- Let's go, Carl.
- Hey, hey.
Let's pump the brakes, Carl, okay?
Belay that order, Carl.
Shortest possible ceremony.
I'm tired of not being married to this woman.
Do you, Ron Swanson, take Diane to be your wife?
Ooh, it's going to start!
Ooh, it's happening!
- I certainly do.
- Oh, my God!
- And do you, Diane, take-- - Yes!
- Yes, I do.
- She said yes!
- Okay.
- Wait!
- By the power vested in me-- - Before you-- Carl, just one second.
I would just like to give a short speech, if I may.
You have ten seconds.
At first glance, it may seem as though Ron Swanson and I have nothing in common, but Webster's dictionary defines "friend--" - Time.
- It's--ugh!
Thank you, Leslie.
I could tell where you were going with that, and it was gonna be beautiful.
- I now pronounce you - Oh!
man and wife.
Hooray!
Yay!
Great job, everyone.
The reception will be held in each of our individual houses, alone.
Pretend this is rice!
That was beautiful.
The people who want to boot me from office have been viciously attacking me for weeks.
Recall Knope!
Recall Knope!
Legalize weed!
Last week, I was an answer in the Pawnee Journal's Crossword Puzzle.
The clue--"Who's the worst," but you know what?
We're fighting back.
I've broken my defense initiative into 40 phases.
We are currently in phase 26: "No problem too small".
Anyone can come to me any time with any problem, no matter how petty or small, and I will fix it personally, and let me tell you, some of these complaints are pretty damn petty and small.
Okay, Gretel, how can I help you today?
There are slugs everywhere on the sidewalk in front of my house.
I want them gone but not killed--I love animals.
But get rid of them.
They're gross.
But make sure they're happy but not too happy.
Well, we're on it, because "No problem too small".
So what now?
Well, I have about 30 more people who want to come into my office and complain to my face.
- Leslie Knope!
- Oh!
Ann Perkins.
Mm.
How's the recall fight going?
This person-to-person campaigning is kind of wearing me down.
Well, as a wise woman once said to me, "Ann, you cunning, pliable, chestnut-haired sunfish, phase 26 is the key to my plan".
Good memory, sunfish.
Let's press on.
I have to come up with some solution for this slug problem.
Someone has a slug infestation?
Boy, oh, boy, we live interesting lives, filled with unexpected challenges.
Life is precious, and every day is a miracle.
Okay.
What a freak.
Things with me and Chris are going really well.
We spend every day together, and we're having so much fun.
And check this out.
Oh, no, there's no ring.
We just had manicures together recently.
Sorry, that was misleading.
Ah, Mr. Haverford, back again, I see.
What the hell, man?
This looks exactly like my store!
I know.
My client is a very determined businessman.
When he rips someone off, he goes all the way.
You see, you are Hydrox, Mr. Haverford.
We are Oreo.
Your mysterious, unnamed client seems like a pretty intense guy.
I am impressed by how quickly he was able to move such a large amount of merchandise.
- Mm.
- He must be one heck of a transporter.
My client is not Jason Statham, if that's what you're thinking.
Some mysterious big shot investor has opened up a store directly across the street from rent-a-swag to try to put me out of business.
I'm not worried, though.
I've poured my heart and soul into my store.
I'm sure this guy's just looking for a place to store all his NBA championship trophies.
- It's not Lebron James.
- Damn.
Well, I hate to say this, gang, but I don't think "No problem too small" is working.
I mean, there's been no press coverage, no change in my poll numbers.
I agree, we need something massive and attention-getting, something that will grab people by the ears, yell at them through a bullhorn, and hit them like a bolt of lightning.
- I got it!
- What is it?
Oh, no, I just-- I got a fly.
I have something.
Remember phase 13, "Think outside of the box"?
Of course.
It was an amazing phase.
Easily a top five phase.
Well, I thought outside of the box, and I nominated you for this big award.
It's called "The International Coalition of Women in Government," and you won.
There's, like, five winners, and you get a big trophy or something.
Oh, my God, this is real.
I just assumed you were lying.
Thank you, but yeah, it's real.
Ann Richards won it once, and Janet Napolitano, I think.
Janet Napoli-fraking-tano?
Oh, my God.
This is amazing and perfect.
This is exactly the kind of big, splashy thing that's gonna get the voters' attention.
When is the ceremony?
- Next monthin London.
- London?
- London?
- We're going to London?
We're going to London, you guys!
I can't believe we're at Hogwarts!
No, that's Buckingham Palace.
Hogwarts is fictional.
Do you know that?
It's important to me that you know that.
Okay, guys, we are going to be sightseeing today.
Andy and Ben are gonna go to their meeting, and then we're gonna go back to the hotel for lunch, and I will spend the day getting to know London's history.
History began on July 4, 1776.
Everything before that was a mistake.
Diane suggested we "tag along to London" for a honeymoon.
I agreed, because my love for her trumps my hatred for Europe.
Then she hit a phase of morning sickness that knocked her for a loop and decided to stay home, but she insisted I go and take pictures for her.
All of this could have been avoided if we'd followed my plan for a honeymoon: a steak dinner, a glass of Lagavulin whiskey, then vigorous lovemaking for two hours, and we're both asleep by 8:30.
Hey, Leslie, we're gonna head to the meeting.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I know it's weird, but I kind of feel bad about leaving Pawnee.
It's like leaving my kid at home without a babysitter.
Leslie, you're in London.
You're 4,000 miles away from home.
- Try to enjoy this, okay?
- Yeah, you're right, as usual.
Good luck.
Ooh, hey boss man, I want to go home early.
Ooh, hold on, actually.
Hang on.
Yeah, no.
I want to quit and never come here again.
Okay, bye.
I can't believe I used to date you!
Tommy Pickles!
You see there's a better version of your store across the street?
And those guys are giving out free pizza with "papperonas".
I know, man.
That's my competition.
They're trying to put me out of business, and it's working.
Three weeks ago, this place was hopping.
My clothes were flying off the rack.
I was spreading swag around town like a killer swag virus.
Now, look at this place.
It's dead!
What am I gonna do?
It's like I always say, okay?
When life gives you lemons, you sell some of your grandma's jewelry, and you go clubbing.
That's not a good piece of advice.
So I'ma throw up.
I ate too much cheese.
I'll talk to you!
I need some better friends.
So the only thing you did was stop drinking beer?
Yeah, I lost 50 pounds in one month.
How much beer were you drinking?
I know, right?
Probably too much.
Andy and I are meeting with an English charity foundation to expand our after-school music program, and British people love me.
There was this British kid in my high school who always called me "Big Ben" and would punch me really hard on the arm, and go, "Bong!
Bong!
Bo--" Oh, he might have hated me.
Real quick, should I do a British accent?
- Um, I'm gonna say no.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- I can do one.
It's not very good, but I think I could pull it off.
I just feel like he's gonna get upset when he finds out that we're American.
He knows we're American.
Ugh, great.
All right, well, I guess we'll take the meeting anyway.
After all, we did come all the way down under.
No.
Lord Covington, I'm Ben Wyatt.
This is Andy Dwyer, and it is an honor to meet you, sir.
Well, it's nice to meet you too.
However, the proper mode of address would be "Your Royal Excellency, Lord Edgar Darby Covington, "14th Earl of Cornwall-upon-Thames, of Hertfordshire".
No, no, no, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
- Oh!
- Please, call me Eddie.
Oh, thank God.
I knew that other name must have been a stupid joke.
Andy-- No, no, no, no, he's absolutely right, it's an absurd name.
Well, I'm excited to hear about your musical charity idea.
- Shall we?
- Yeah.
The Notting Hill bus tour starts at 2:00, the Love Actually bus tour starts at 2:30, and--oh, the Bridget Jones bus tour starts at 2:30 also.
What do we do?
Ron, your pick.
Look, a clock.
We don't have that in America.
You call that a tower?
Try the Sears Tower, friend.
"London at night".
That is very funny.
Can I help you, sir?
Yes.
I will take this.
We don't accept American currency, sir.
Of course you do.
That's the most wonderful piece of paper in the world.
Accept it.
Very sorry, sir.
Fine.
Enjoy the fact that your royal overlords are a frail, old woman and a tiny baby.
You really think this will work, Donna?
Why wouldn't it?
We just pull the business license-- it's public information-- and then at least you'll have an address.
Ooh, here.
Hmm, some kind of shady, fake shell corporation - called "Open 4 Business, LLC".
- Thanks, Donna.
Hey, if it's Akon and y'all become best friends, I want a ride on his plane.
- Done and done.
- Nice.
"1020 Maple Street".
Ann and Chris?
What are they doing here?
Sir, you can't go in there!
Aha!
I caught you!
- Hey, it's Tom!
- What the hell are you doing?
What am I doing?
What are you doing here?
Dr. Saperstein is giving me a sonogram, in his doctor's office, for women, because I'm pregnant!
Oh, my God.
- You're Jean-Ralphio's dad!
- Mm-hmm.
You're the one that's trying to put me out of business!
Well, look at that, Mr. Haverford.
You tracked me down.
Looks like your detective skills are a lot better than your tween, high-end fashion rental skills.
Ann, Chris, can we have the room, please?
No, you certainly cannot.
Dr. Saperstein, why are you doing this?
What did I ever do to you?
You know exactly why I'm doing this.
You destroyed my family.
First, you screwed my son out of your business, and then you stole my daughter's virginity.
Wait, you're serious?
Deadly serious.
According to my daughter, you broke her heart.
Then you smashed up her BMW.
I had to buy her a new one, so she could drive to Divinity School.
Let me tell you something, mister.
You attack a Saperstein, you face my wrath.
Be so sure about this, Tiny Tom, that I will crush you like the bug you are And there it is, the heartbeat.
- Ohh.
- Everything sounds perfect.
Ohh.
This is the moment we were dreaming of: you and me and our baby.
And Tom and his weird feud with our doctor.
So this after-school music program has been really successful in Pawnee, and we've expanded it to eight other towns in Indiana, but we feel with your help, we can-- Whoa!
Are those-- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Are those remote control helicopters?
- Yeah.
- What?
I got them as a gift.
I bought them for one of my nephews, - and then I decided to keep them.
- Yeah.
Would you like to play with them?
Oh, would I?
I call blue one!
I call the-- oh.
Okay, you get the blue one.
Andy, we are guests of Lord Covington.
Maybe you should let him play with the blue helicopter.
What are you talking about, dude?
- I called it.
- He called it.
- That's the rule.
- That's the rule.
Anyway, the orange one's better.
- What?
- Come on.
Aah!
Hey, get off!
Okay, watch out!
Watch out!
- Agh!
- Ohh!
Dude, awesome.
I think I broke mine!
- Oh, bummer.
- So, like, you your family owns all this stuff?
Well, no, not everything.
We own that building, that one, that house, that round thing, that one.
We don't own that.
Oh, no, actually, we do own that.
What else does your family own?
Well, um, have you heard of Scotland?
As I was saying, we've really made this music program work in Indiana, and we think, with your help, we could turn this into a wide-reaching international program.
Oh, you know what I want?
Ice cream.
Do you guys have that here, ice cream?
Oh, it's so good.
You have to get it.
It's, like, scoops, and it comes on a cone.
- Yeah.
- Do you have that here?
- We have it.
Of course we-- - You have it?
Where do you think you are, the moon?
- That'd be awesome if we were.
- Yeah.
Can we get some?
Could we do--could we have some?
Could we?
Sure.
Yeah.
- Let's go.
- Just what do I do with this?
Just throw it there.
Roger will pick it up.
Oh.
"So I long for a day "when women in government will simply be seen "as people in government, but until then, "I will work to make Pawnee, my wonderful hometown, as good as it can be".
What do you think?
I think you should lose the first line and the last line and all of the other lines, and instead, just walk up to the mic and meow really loudly for eight minutes.
Okay, this trip is amazing, but I miss Pawnee, you know?
I want to know what's happening there.
One little news blast wouldn't hurt.
Welcome to The Final Word With Perd.
Ms. Pinewood, there is a thing you are doing, and that thing is you are leading a recall vote against Councilwoman Knope, and you say you have new, shocking allegations about her.
What?
What now?
Perd, I take no pleasure in reporting this, but it must come to light.
We are here, trying to make Pawnee better, and where is Leslie Knope?
She's gallivanting around Europe like some kind of European.
How--how did they get that picture so Facebook.
- But I just put-- - Facebook.
- But isn't it a-- - Facebook.
Apparently, she can't be bothered to stay here in Pawnee, not when there's Europe to gallivant around in.
Well, we conducted a Perd poll and asked this question: not be in Europe, and 35% said they were confused by the way the question was posed.
Oh, my God.
You're leaving tonight?
I can't believe there's even a flight?
Well, not to Indiana, but there's a 9:00 red-eye to Lisbon, and then I can catch the 4:30 A.M. back to Edinburgh, connect through Houston, head on up to Cincinnati and then rent a car, drive around 90, and I'll be home two hours earlier than if I flew home as planned.
Easy breezy!
Leslie, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I do not think you should leave Europe right now.
You flew all this way.
Have some perspective.
You have some perspective!
I'm sorry.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm stressed.
Okay, I need to calm down.
Let's go walk past Colin Firth's house again.
Ugh, who is that?
Hold up.
My dad said that?
Yeah, Jean-Ralphio.
He told me that I had screwed you - out of my business - What?
So he was gonna screw me back.
Any idea why he'd believe such a thing?
That is so weird.
That is so-- oh, you know what?
Honestly, now that I'm thinking about it, this may be it.
I actually told him that Rent-A-Swag was my idea and that you had stole it from me.
Why would you say that?
Because my dad is always riding me for never having a job, and I just didn't want to show that I blew it again.
Ohand I don't know if this is relevant - Hmm.
- But I told him that you made me sign up for a bunch of credit cards and then max them out by buying illegal white jaguar fur coats.
That's probably not relevant, though.
It's probably not relevant, though.
- I don't know-- - I guess-- All this lying about me stops now!
- Hmm.
- This is my life.
Please, one of you has to tell him the truth.
- Not it!
- Not it!
Ooh, you got me!
Whoa ho!
Uh-oh, uh-oh!
- Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.
Okay, fine.
You know what?
I'm gonna do the unthinkable.
I'm gonna have a short, honest conversation with my father.
Thank you.
Oh, that's a big cheering section.
Okay, that's Khongordzol, from Mongolia.
She grew up in a hut that was entirely made of ice and mud, then she became their mayor, then their police chief and their best Wolverine Wrangler.
I love her.
Oh, hi.
You must be Leslie Knope.
I'm Ulee Danssen.
I'm one of the honorees.
Wow, look at your face.
What?
- It's just so symmetrical.
- Oh, thanks!
You know, we all have that in Denmark.
Oh, you're from Denmark, of course.
Wow, what part of Denmark are you from?
I'm from Silkeborg.
You know.
It's not one of the most perfect places in the world, but I love it, and it loves me.
And look what they've done for me.
- They made a statue of you!
- Yes.
Wow.
Is that goat cheese?
Good cheese eye, Leslie.
It is made out of goat cheese.
We have a lot of it, and after tonight's event, they're going to consume me with crackers.
They just love me.
What about your town?
Well, Pawnee, Indiana, is a wonderful town, and I love it, but they hate me.
And they're trying to kick me out of office.
One time, they made a pinata of my face, and then everybody in the town came and took turns hitting it with a stick, and they filled it with broccoli, just to add insult to injury but politics you know what I mean, right?
I don't, no.
So you're from Mongolia?
Will you take me with you when you go back there?
I love you.
Hmm.
Did you understand that?
Did you bring any wolverines?
Say it again.
Say it again.
Alu-min-ium.
Okay, okay.
You say it.
You say it.
You say it.
It's "alumilum".
- "Alumilum"?
- Okay.
- Alumilum!
- Uh, Eddie if you'd like me to talk more about the program, - I would be happy to - Mm-hmm.
But my wife is receiving an award in just a few minutes, and I really need to get over there.
Yes, of course.
The thing is, I don't know what I'm doing.
- Me neither.
- I'm sorry?
My family has a huge amount of money.
We live in a castle that has 1,000 acres of land.
Our hedge maze is so vast, once, I got lost in there for two days.
What?
That's awesome.
It was awesome.
There was a statue of a lion inside, and I found a yo-yo.
Well, do you-- do you have it here?
- Guys-- - The point is, I started this foundation in order to do something good with our money, and I've heard hundreds of charity pitches, and I honestly don't know whether they're good or bad.
If I may, ours is great.
Brilliant!
I'm in.
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah.
I like you, I like music.
On one condition: I want you to stay here in London with me for no more than three months, to help me get it up and running and tell me what to do.
Oh, well, that actually may be tough.
I mean, my wife is in the middle of this recall fight, and I really need to-- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, I meant Andy.
I want Andy to stay.
Is that a goose that just flew by the window?
Oh, it's a plastic bag.
Did you see that?
Wait, did I interrupt?
What are you guys talking about?
Let's see if it was a goose.
I think it could have been, honest to God.
Silkeborg is wonderful, and I am very supported and loved.
Once, on my birthday, the town trained a reindeer to do a dance for me.
It was beautiful, and the reindeer was delicious.
- Hey.
- Hey!
How was your meeting?
Good.
I'll fill you in later.
Are you ready for your speech?
Uhyeah.
Yeah.
Thank you, Ulee.
It is so inspiring to hear stories of powerful women who are held in high esteem by their hometowns.
Now, from the hometown of Pawnee, Indiana, in the United States, Leslie Knope.
First let me say, it is a true honor to be here among these amazing women.
You all inspire me with your accomplishments and the things you have done for your hometowns and the things your hometowns have done for you.
I mean, they're just truly You know, I've been a public servant for a long time.
And you know how I spend my days?
Cleaning slime out of rivers and removing slugs from people's front yards.
And I love my town, but you know how they repay me?
By hating me.
They hate me.
They want to recall me.
I wish I could move to Silkeborg and dance with a reindeer.
You're always welcome in Silkeborg!
Olga, let's start a statue of Leslie.
See?
They like me in Silkeborg more than my own hometown, and I've never even been there.
I love Pawnee, but sometimes it sucks.
The people can be very mean and ungrateful, and they cling to their fried dough and their big sodas, and then they get mad at me when their pants don't fit.
You know, I'm sick of it.
Pawnee is filled with a bunch of pee-pee-heads.
Thank you very much for this amazing award.
I'm sorry I said "pee-pee-heads".
Whoo!
That's my boss!
That speech was a little rough, don't you think?
Whatever, it's how I feel.
Stupid, ungrateful town.
Plus, you said it yourself: We're 4,000 miles away.
- Hello.
- Leslie, it's Jerry.
Jerry who?
Gergich.
Jer--oh, Jerry.
Jerry, why are you calling me?
I don't want to waste my international minutes.
Leslie, your speech was webcast, here in Pawnee.
Everyone saw it.
What do you mean, "everyone"?
I had organized a big viewing party, you know, to support you, and, well, now that Kathryn Pinewood lady, she's already pounced.
She's calling it the "Pee-pee-head" speech.
- Bloody hell, Jerry!
- So how's Lond-- I just never thought that I would get to make this announcement.
It's a very special day.
Okay.
Hi, Donna.
So You're pregnant.
Oh, man, Tom told you.
Nope.
You're drinking decaf coffee, which you usually only do in the afternoon, you're wearing an empire-waist dress and loose shoes 'cause your feet are already swelling.
I'd put you at nine, maybe ten weeks.
My goodness, you're observant.
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.
Hmm.
When did you make the switch to boxer briefs?
Yesterday.
Okay, please stop looking at him.
Why are we here?
Just thought you needed some fresh air, even if that air is filled with the foul stench of European socialism.
You know, I know I am supposed to feel bad about what I said, but I do not.
Pawnee has really been pissing me off lately.
Leslie, for God's sake, you're the adult here.
When your kid screams "I hate you," you don't sink to his level and yell "I hate you" back.
You have to be the grown-up.
You're right.
I know.
I have to be the grown-up.
But it's so hard!
Ron!
God!
And nobody ever thanks you.
You choose a thankless job, you can't be upset when nobody thanks you.
And by the way, April thanked you.
She nominated you for this award.
Well, April does that all the time.
She nominated Ann for Motocross Driver of the Year award just so she could get a rejection letter.
April respects you, and so do many others.
Don't start chasing applause and acclaim.
That way lies madness.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I finally got you a proper wedding gift, part one of many.
A train ticket?
You think I want to extend my stay on this godforsaken continent?
Yes, you do.
If you follow that itinerary to the letter, I promise you, you will not be disappointed.
Well, I would offer to buy you a drink, but where the hell would that even happen?
This is London, Ron.
There's a pub over there, there's a pub over there, there's a pub between those two butcher shops.
Let's go to that one, but we'll be stopping in those two butcher shops first.
Hey, Jerry.
I didn't know you were working today.
Yeah, Ron asked me to come in while he's away.
Of course, I had to cancel my cardiologist appoint-- That's great.
Now, here's a piece of information that is interesting.
Ann is pregnant, and it's my baby.
Oh, my God, that's wonderful news!
Oh, there's so much in front of you.
I mean, soon you're gonna start showing, and then your clothes will feel tight, and then, oh, people are gonna start rubbing your tummy all the time!
That sounds terrible.
Well, Gayle, she got really queasy, and I gained a lot of sympathy weight.
Yeah.
You know, actually, before my kids, I looked a lot like you, Chris.
I'm very sad.
Please stop talking.
And, of course, pretty soon, Ann, your milk is gonna come in.
- Ohh.
- That is exciting.
Mmm.
Yep, and it happens sooner than you'd think.
The babies can sense it.
You would be shocked, 'cause they are rooting around for that nipple.
Mm, mm.
Gimme, gimme.
Mm, mm, mm.
I want milk!
Mm, mm, mm, mm.
Ohh.
Life is a miracle.
Mm, mm, mm.
So it's kind of awesome that the Lord Fancyface Guy wants you to stay.
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, I can't do it, obviously.
Why?
I don't even know what I would be doing.
I mean, besides, this is England.
Everything is so weird.
It's all different.
Yeah, like how they drive on the other side of the road.
Do they?
I'll be damned.
Yeah, like that.
That's what I'm-- exactly what I'm talking about.
Or like the Piccadilly Circus we went to?
Not even a circus.
There's no elephants, there was no cotton candy, there's no clowns.
One bearded lady.
She got all rude when I marveled at her.
Do you like the Lord Fancyface Guy?
Oh, he's awesome.
He's everything you would want in a boss.
I mean, remote control helicopters, talks funny.
Total package.
I think you should do it.
When are you gonna have another opportunity like this?
- I mean-- - And, plus, we can deal with the distance, okay?
Remember, I was in Washington last year.
He said he wanted me to head up the company.
I have no idea how to run a nonprofit.
Hey.
You shined shoes for over two years and never made a profit.
Come on, you can hack this.
I believe in you.
But to replace you, I am going to have to build a scarecrow replica of you and take it to the movies.
Seems like the only logical solution.
My point is, Ethel, that Ann's pregnant.
And I'm the baby daddy!
How wonderful for you.
You don't seem very excited for us.
I barely know you, and I don't have to talk to you unless it's about work.
Man, I thought this would be more satisfying.
I agree.
Wait a minute, what time is it?
Has she landed yet?
Oh, I'm so happy for you guys!
Ohh, this is the greatest day in the history of days.
This day, a thousand years from now, will be celebrated as the beginning of a new and better human race.
I am so happy for you, I'm never letting you go.
I am not gonna let you go.
Oh, oh, oh, eventually, she's going to have to go back to work.
Are you sure you should be working?
I mean, you should be resting and getting fluids and-- and cold compresses and greasy foods.
That's for a hangover.
Right, yeah, of course.
I'm so goofed-up right now.
I'm so jet-lagged.
I took a sleeping pill on the plane, and then I changed my mind, so I took this thing called "Zapvigil," which, apparently, is what Israeli fighter pilots use to stay awake.
So right now, it looks like I'm talking to a giant crab.
Stay away from me, crab!
I'm just kidding.
I know it's Ann.
We are so glad you're back.
We talked to, like, 50 people, and, frankly, not one of them gave us the reaction that we were hoping for.
And your reaction, from someone we love so much, I mean, it just makes up for all the other ones.
- Ohh.
- Anyway, welcome home!
Don't pinch me!
Thank you all for coming, and let me just say how truly, deeply trill it is to be standing in this dope-ass conference room, addressing a group of people in a business meeting.
It's really a dream come true.
Right now, I want to turn the floor over to Jean-Ralphio, who has something to say.
Tom, lawyer guy daddy Tom did not screw me out of the company.
He gave me every opportunity to jump in at the ground floor, and I said no, not because I thought it was a bad idea, but because-- and this is very important-- I really didn't care about what was happening.
So why, exactly, did you lie when I asked you what had happened?
Daddy-D!
Daddy, come on, I lie to you all the time!
All those math camps I said I went to?
I don't even know what a math camp is!
So all those postcards that you sent me, all those trophies that you'd won Trophies I bought I also have something to say.
I have done nothing wrong, ever, in my life.
I know this and I love you.
I love you too, daddy.
Money, please!
My money.
Dr. Saperstein, your son is my best friend.
- Yeah.
- He's like a brother to me.
But he's a disaster, and your daughter seriously needs to be locked up in some sort of insane asylum.
- Mm.
- On an island - Ooh.
- In space.
Hold on These two have been huge disappointments to me.
Come on, you love us.
Tell me you love us, and then admit this guy looks like Beaker from the Muppets.
Dad!
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me!
But seriously, what are we doing here, though?
- What are we doing here, dad?
- Like, what is this?
- Why are we here?
- So So now you know the truth.
Will you back off?
No, I will not stop.
Yes, this all started as vengeance for my children, but the company is making money now.
Why would I back off just 'cause these nincompoops lie to me all the time?
No, I'm not gonna back off.
I'm gonna continue, and I'm gonna crush you!
All right, you two, are you in for dinner tomorrow night?
- Yes!
- Yes, daddy.
Huh?
Blow me a kiss.
Mwah!
- Mwah.
- Caught it.
I love you, daddy!
- Me too.
- I love you, daddy!
Hey, are you gonna be okay with Andy gone?
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Are you gonna be okay with Ben still here?
- April - What?
I don't trust him.
I never have.
- He's after your money.
- Hey, Gretel!
Hello, it's me, City Councilwoman Leslie Knope.
And me, Odie the dog, Garfield's enemy.
Now, we have some great news: we were in London, and we met a wonderful woman from Mongolia.
Yeah, her name was Khongordzol, and I love her more than anything in the world.
Khongordzol and Odie, here, were emailing, and she recommended a very humane way to get rid of slugs.
You sprinkle coffee grounds on the affected area, and it drives the slugs away.
Isn't that great?
I didn't want all the slugs gone.
I wanted most of them gone!
Sorry.
Well, we'll put one slug back.
Either way, your problem is solved.
Oh, my God, that lady is the worst.
She didn't even say thank you.
That's not why we do this, April.
We do it because it's good and it helps people, not to get the applause.
Yeah, but doesn't that bum you out?
Well, sure, it would be nice if just one person appreciated my work, at all.
But that's the job-- wiping slime and shoveling slugs.
All right.
On to the next complaint.
Where the hell are you sending me, Knope?
Morning, cutie.
Morning, Jessica.
Whoa.
These were a gift from your British friend, Lord Edgar Covington.
He was very impressed with you two.
He sounded rich on the phone.
I think he was calling me from a helicopter.
Could be.
He owns two.
So Andy's gonna stay there for three months.
I hope he's okay.
He sent me an email this morning.
I guess he got on the wrong train on the way to work and got lost.
Yeah, this isn't right.
None of this looks familiar.
Eddie?
Uh-oh, Spaghettios.
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure he'll adjust.
No, I named that dog Spaghettios, and he just pooped in your briefcase.
Oh, my.
Okay.
Come on, Sugarbutt!
Oh, which one's Sugarbutt?
That's you!
Come on.
We got a board meeting, Sugarbutt.
Wildly inappropriate.
Do you think there's any chance your dad will give up?
I doubt it.
He never gives up on anything, except for my mom.
When she turned 30, he was like, "Get out"!
Maybe I should just throw in the towel.
Your dad'll destroy me.
I'll be left with nothing.
Thought I was a better-looking version of Zuckerberg.
Turns out I'm the better-looking version of the Winklevoss twins.
First of all, unbelievable analogy.
Second of all, what are you talking about, man?
You're Tommy Haverford!
You're an idea man.
When Babyface was your age, he hadn't even signed Toni Braxton yet, let alone Usher.
You're right.
I mean, I'm basically Babyface.
You're basically Babyface!
Okay, I'm gonna keep going, and I'm gonna beat your dad.
That's what I'm talking about!
And for me, it's a win-win either way.
Either my best friend emerges triumphant, or my dad beats you, and I get all that money when he dies.
I'm actually getting dinner with my dad right now.
- You want to come?
- No!
I mean, this is all pretty overwhelming, you know?
You know what I just read?
Right now, our baby is the size of a green olive.
Isn't that wild?
It is.
A green olive.
A little high in sodium.
I would have preferred a chickpea or a cherry tomato.
- Our baby's not a salad.
- Yes, right.
It's just weird, you know?
I mean, for so long, this little green olive was just our thing, and now it's everyone's thing.
Every time Jerry looks at me, he's thinking about the milk in my boobs.
It's still just our thing.
It'll always be just our thing.
That's why it's so wonderful and why we'll love it so much.
You know, Olive's kind of a cute name, if it's a girl.
I prefer "Chickpea".
Because it's lower in sodium?
- Yes, exactly.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Are you leaving?
Well, I just have to get a jump start on my next phase.
Let's see, it is "48-Hour Roadkill Scrape-athon".
Oh, brother.
Okay, well, before you go, I have something for you.
I feel like you're getting sad about how stupid and lame people are, and that is my job, not yours.
So I'm gonna read this letter to you, out loud, but if you hug me afterwards, I swear to God, I'll scream and pull my hair out and maybe punch you in the face.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Please sit.
"Dear award committee members" Leslie, I didn't even start.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
"Dear award committee members, "where I live, there are a lot of apathetic people, "people who don't care at all about what they do "or how they do it.
"They let the world wash over them "and barely notice anyone else is even there.
"Leslie Knope is not one of these people.
"She cares about everything and everyone in our town.
"I don't know how she does it.
"People come to her with the pettiest, "stupidest problems, "and she cares-- like, really, actually cares-- "what happens to them.
"And if you're lucky enough to be her friend, "your life gets better every day.
"She spends every waking moment thinking "of new ways to make her friends happy.
"There is something wonderful about seeing someone "who has found her true purpose on earth.
"For some people, I guess that's being an astronaut "or a hot dog-eating champion.
"For Leslie, her true purpose on earth, her true meaning, "is making people's lives better.
"That's what I love about her, "and that's why she deserves this award.
"Sincerely Satan".
You're getting hugged right now.
No, I told you not to.
- I'm giving you a hug.
- No!
Stay away!
No!
All my life I've avoided Europe and its multitudes of terribleness.
But it turns out, much to my surprise, there is actually one place in Europe that is worth seeing: these tiny islands off the coast of Scotland, where God's chosen elixirs are distilled, barreled, and prepared for consumption.
This is worth the trip.
"Dear Ron, "you have now reached the cliffsides "overlooking the islands.
"As you sit here and gaze upon the waters, "please read out loud the poem "by the great Scotsman Robert Burns.
Love, Leslie".
"Oh, were my love yon lilac fair, "with purple blossoms to the spring, "and I, a bird to shelter there, "when wearied on my little wing, "how I would mourn when it was torn "by autumn wild and winter rude, "but I would sing on wanton wing, when youthful may its bloom renewed".
I don't know what she thought I'd get out of that.
- Nice to be home.
- It is.
But I mean, I love Pawnee, I will always love Pawnee, but London is amazing.
And Silkeborg sounds amazing, and Mongolia sounds amazing.
Their mayor is a professional Wolverine Wrangler.
Fine, Mongolia sounds terrifying, but the world is a very big place, and I've seen very little of it.
Maybe we should travel more, expand our horizons.
You know, I've had the same kinds of thoughts.
We should keep that in mind, see where it leads us.
Yeah.
Oh, there's one more thing I want to try.
Mm.
I got you something in London: a traditional barrister's wig.
- Oh.
- Wear it for me.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
All right.
What's up?
No, not sexy.
Failed experiment.
Take it off.
- Okay, just--okay.
- Just take it off.
No.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Okay, here's the text I added a few more jokes, slamming Eagleton at the end.
Mmm.
That's the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.
I'm so glad you're on my team.
Are you sure you wanna attack 'em at this press conference?
It's a friendly wager on a high school basketball game.
I'm losing the recall election, Ben.
Slamming Eagleton is the easiest way to score some points.
Look.
Am I proud of it?
Yes.
Because Eagleton sucks.
But is it the classiest move?
Yes, because Eagleton sucks.
Would I do it again?
Yes, because Eagleton sucks.
This year, we get to host the Pawnee-Eagleton tip-off classic.
That awful human being is Ingrid de Forest.
She's a city councilor from Eagleton.
She thinks she's so great because she won the Miss Indiana Beauty Pageant.
Last year.
While she was in office.
And pregnant.
As always, we would like to make a friendly wager with Eagleton.
If you beat us this year, we will give you a basket of apples from our Pawnee orchard.
Ew, pesticide.
Yuck.
Oh, no, these are pesticide-free.
I ate one of these for breakfast this morning, and I found a worm in it.
So, I bet somebody feels pretty stupid right now.
Well, Leslie, I think we had similar ideas.
If you win, Eagleton will give you this basket of oranges.
Of course, it's silly to compare apples and oranges, but what the heck.
These are made of Swarovski crystal, and they're worth $700,000.
Leslie, you're down 15 points in the latest poll for the recall election.
What can you do to make up the deficit?
I'll tell you what I'd do if I was an Eagletonian.
I'd pop a Xanax and ask my butler to help me out.
I mean, I'm not saying that Eagletonians are out of touch.
But when you tell 'em it's time to change their oil, they ask, "Extra virgin or white truffle"?
Thanks, guys.
I'll see ya at the game.
Unless, of course, you're an Eagletonian, and then you'll be too busy polishing your monocle at the caviar store.
Knope out.
Yeah.
Who or what is Penny Saver?
It's a free circular with a bunch of coupons in it.
This was sent to Ron Swanson at Diane's address, where I've lived for less than a month.
How is that possible?
This is an extreme invasion of privacy.
The right to privacy is very important to me.
My family has had a single P.O. box for several generations.
We only ever subscribe to two magazines, Reader's Digest and Ebony.
Ebony was due to a clerical error, but it ended up being an interesting year of reading.
I don't know how this was delivered to me, but it cannot happen again.
How can I stop it?
Mm.
Donna is great with this sort of thing.
She got me off the Williams-Sonoma mailing list, but then I just signed back up again.
Hooked on their oven mitts.
I need my mitts on those mitts.
Let me know the second Donna returns.
According to her Twitter feed, she got coffee five minutes ago.
Wait, now she's Ustreaming her walk back.
She should be here in three, two, one.
Hey, hey.
Hashtag quest for coffee, blowin' up my timeline.
You get my snapchat about it?
- No.
- What?
There it is.
- Hey, you wanted to see me?
- I did.
- Think fast.
- Oh, my God.
Hey, Dr. Buttons-- I mean, my old calculator.
It doesn't have a name.
Why did you throw this at me?
I just got off the phone with our old boss from Indianapolis, and apparently there may be some sort of a budget problem in Eagleton.
He asked if maybe you and I wouldn't have a look.
You in?
Butch Count-sidy and the Sum-dance Kid, together again.
- Hmm.
- Auditing bros!
Yeah, and auditing sistah.
Let's do this.
Oh, you're coming?
If there's a problem with Eagleton, I wanna be there.
That's like a dream come true.
Besides, I have a new routine I'm working on.
Kind of like a Jeff Foxworthy-type thing, but about Eagleton.
If you make your omelet out of Faberge eggs, - you just might - Be an Eagletonian.
Yippee!
Road trip!
Who's excited to go to Bloomington?
Is that where you're gonna sit?
I'm driving.
Where else would I sit?
Trunk.
I helped April get into vet school in Bloomington and today's her orientation, so we're taking a little road trip.
While I'm there, I'm also gonna pick up an organic baby blanket.
I would get one in Pawnee, but fun fact-- our only baby store is attached to a chemical refinery.
I made a special road trip mix CD for us.
- I hope you like Tori Amos.
- Oh, cool.
It really is a pleasure to see you in this context, Ingrid.
Say cheese.
Damn it.
You look beautiful.
Can you give us a little more information surrounding the deficits that you're running this year?
Ooh, gosh.
We don't really like to talk about money.
We find a little gauche.
This is a budget meeting.
Well, most of our files are in these boxes if you really wanna take a look at how much that we've spent.
Why don't we just dig in and see what we're up against?
Yes.
And thank you.
We really appreciate your help.
Are you tipping me?
Is that 100Euros?
People ought to have the right to be left alone.
I wanna get completely off the grid.
That's crazy talk.
I live for the grid.
It's where I meet And if you're off the grid, how are you gonna post photos of the dope food at restaurants you're at and all the cool places you're stuntin' in?
Food is for eating.
Places are for being.
End of discussion.
Don't leave the grid, Ron.
The grid is the best.
If anything, you need to get more on the grid.
Grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid-- If you help me get off the grid, I will let both of you go home early.
No grid, no grid, no grid, no grid.
All right, so you have everything you need for orientation?
Yeah, an empty Sprite can, an old man's fingernail in my pocket, and a picture of Patrick Ewing on a roller coaster.
- I'm all set.
- Great.
Hi.
My friend here is enrolling in the vet school next month, and she would like to be shown around.
Totally, happy to.
I'm Laura.
I'm April Ludgate Kevorkian.
So you go with Laura, who seems really nice and does not deserve to be tortured.
And I will come meet up with you after I finish at the baby store.
Sure you wanna leave me here with her?
What if I'm a murderer?
Oh, that's funny.
This is worse than I could've imagined.
Their debt-to-equity ratio is ridonkulous.
What a hilarious word.
It reminds me of a ridiculous donkey.
He's the best.
What does this mean for them?
They were in financial trouble a few years ago, like Pawnee was, but their government just kept borrowing money.
Eagleton is on the brink of an epic financial disaster.
Ahh.
Now that is the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.
Really, that?
This is gonna hand me the recall election.
I saved Pawnee from bankruptcy.
Now I get to remind people of that fact as we watch our worst enemy collapse into bankruptcy.
Plus, guess what I get to do after the game now.
You pretend you're Ingrid.
Let's pretend this box is the basket of apples I bet them on the game.
I see where you're going with this.
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, you're gonna ask me - if I like apples-- - Do you like apples?
We just watched this movie two nights ago, so-- - Do you like apples?
- I don't wanna do this.
How about them apples?
Paul, if you ever see another one of these with my name on it, I want you to drive into the woods and bury it.
I don't decide who gets mail, sir.
I just deliver it.
Passing the buck-- the last refuge of the cowardly and black-hearted.
- That seems harsh.
- Get out.
We got rid of your cell phone.
This is your last credit card.
Are you sure you want me to cut up this card?
It gets you into the parking garage.
I'll be taking the bus now, and I'll be paying in cash.
What other traces of me exist in the world?
Think, people.
Isn't there a photo of you up at JJ's Diner, from that time when you-- aah!
Come on, Tom!
This place is unbelievable.
It has everything I need: Video monitors, lead-free pacifiers.
These are the first bibs I've ever seen without Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s face on them.
Really?
April?
Excuse me, sorry.
April, why aren't you at orientation?
Um, I was at orientation, but it was lame, so I left.
And then I kept walking, and now here I am.
We are going back there right now, young lady.
- Mm-mm.
- Come on.
God, get off me, stranger.
I'm so sorry we're late.
We came from our bankruptcy brunch.
And Michael Buble played, but he ran a little long.
I love Michael Buble.
Was a bankruptcy brunch the best idea?
Sure, let's not have brunch like animals.
Well, um, some of these expenditures are questionable.
Uh, you filled the public pools with bottled water?
Total body hydration.
What is this here?
This massive expenditure from public works?
Ah, yes.
Well, yes.
We purchased HBO for the whole town.
I'm sorry.
You spent government money on a TV subscription?
It's not TV.
Al right.
Uh, Leslie's put together a presentation for a financial recovery.
Great.
You may find it very informative.
Let's get started with our first slide.
"Well, well, well" Tsk, tsk, tsk.
JJ, a few months ago, I came in here and began eating eggs.
They were delicious, so I ordered more.
Before long, I believe I had eaten-- Couldn't cook 'em fast enough.
The last ten were still in the shell.
It was a JJ's Diner record, and you took his picture.
Now, we need that picture, for privacy reasons.
Okay, but I don't know how anybody would know it's you.
We followed your instructions.
That's too much information.
Let's go.
Where are we going now?
I've eaten a lot of food in a lot of restaurants.
Why is everyone else so bad at eating?
I only agreed to come back here because of our deal.
Do you promise to play along?
- Yes.
- Do you?
- Yes.
- Hi, you're back.
Hello again.
As you remember, I'm April, and this is Ann, my 65-year-old grandmother.
Yes, that's who I am.
Anyway, we'd love to hear about Bloomington.
It seems like a real hip kind of college town.
Mee-maw, God, no one uses the word hip anymore.
Sometimes I wish you went down on the Titanic with all your sorority sisters.
I would be happy to show you guys around the campus.
Is there anything in particular that you wanna see?
How are your local graveyards?
I have some planning to do.
"You blew it.
"Super hard.
"Complete buffoonery.
It's hilarious".
And "You deserve it".
Hey, you think you might wanna take it easy on them a little bit?
Oh, like they took it easy on us when they stole all our money and seceded from our town?
That was 200 years ago.
Cool it.
Fine.
I'll skip ahead.
Do you have a plan that will help us or not?
We have borrowed absolutely everything we can from the state.
And really, Pawnee is our only hope.
We do have a plan.
We are willing to provide a bridge loan for $50,000.
compounded monthly.
And you need to release a statement that says that Pawnee rules and Eagleton drools.
Well, now you're just being nasty.
I understand that our towns have a complicated history, but we have a saying in Eagleton "You don't kick a dressage horse after a failed pas de deux".
Whatever, blondie.
Your butler made your bed, now you gotta lie in it.
And if you walk out that door, none of us here, and I repeat, none of us will ever help you again.
Oh, my God.
They have Michael Buble on retainer.
Okay, all public photos of me recovered.
Nameplate removed from my office door.
Pediatrician files confiscated and destroyed.
- Anything I'm missing?
- Great news, Ron.
Jean-Ralphio loves your shirt.
What the hell are you talking about?
Oh, I've been taking pictures of you all day for my new Facebook album: "RonSwan: Gettin' off the grid".
Tom, do you maybe see a problem with what you've done?
I do now.
Yes, sorry.
Erase.
Erase.
Erase.
Erase all pictures of Ron!
Erase all pictures of Ron!
Erase all pictures of Ron!
What the hell is happening?
I think you accidentally opened up Vine.
You just vined your first selfie, Ron.
And I'm vining you vine your selfie.
The world is a nightmare.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Erase all pictures of Ron!
Erase all pictures of Ron!
The B-line is a cool outdoor trail that cuts right through downtown.
She said the B-line is cool, Mee-maw.
Cool means good.
Thank you, Laura, for showing us around.
Sure.
See you in a couple weeks, April.
See?
This place is great.
Aren't you glad we came back and talked to her?
No.
It was pointless.
I'm not going to school here.
April, don't flake out on this.
You're gonna love it here.
Bloomington is great.
It's got culture and music and tons of youngsters.
Youngsters?
Am I 65 years old?
Yeah, I'm not going here.
I don't want to.
Let's leave.
- Think fast.
- Oh!
Why do people keep assuming I'm ready to catch things?
"Eagleton: No money, mo' problems".
Fantastic, right?
I made enough of them for everybody to wear at the game.
I do like a good internal rhyme.
Ben, you ready for dinner?
We can go over the poll numbers.
Ohyou know, I've got a few phone calls to make.
Can you give me an hour?
I can meet you there.
Oh, my God.
- What is she doing here?
- I'm sorry, Leslie, but you didn't really help them very much, so we volunteered to give them a little financial advice.
You didn't actually help us at all.
- Just one second.
- Yeah.
I'm just gonna help them out, okay?
- Mm.
- Just for an hour.
He's just being a good neighbor.
We're in a lot of trouble, Leslie.
I don't need any lip from you, okay?
You're in trouble because of your own stupidity.
I have a PhD from the Sorbonne.
For what?
Wearing Chanel suits?
There was a fashion component, yes.
I'm not mad that you're doing this.
Yes, I am mad that you're doing this.
But even worse, I'm mad that you just - lied to me about it.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
We all swore that we weren't gonna ever help her again, ever.
I never said that.
You did.
I speak for all of us in all matters.
That is what you tacitly agreed to - when you married me.
- What?
Yeah, let's go.
You've changed your mind.
You're not gonna help her anymore.
Leslie, I just wanna borrow your husband for the evening.
Can we please talk about what happened back there?
What, Ann?
I just stole your phone and texted every guy in it that the baby was theirs.
It's not that big of a deal.
Listen, I know you don't believe this, but I care about your future.
And I'm just a little disappointed that you're just not following through with this.
Yeah, it's not about following through, okay?
I was on the fence about whether I wanted to do it.
And as soon as I got there, I just had a gut feeling that it wasn't right for me, that's all.
So, just like that, boom--huge life decision made?
That's how I make all my life decisions.
My gut is always right, okay?
It was right about marrying Andy, and it was right when it told me that you would be the worst person I would ever meet in my life.
And I've met Guy Fieri, Ann.
So gross!
How do you get your gut to talk to you?
You don't get your gut to talk to you.
You just listen when it says something.
Well, right now my gut is saying that we are going to listen to Mariah Carey the whole way home.
Good.
Whoa.
Wow, I'm really surprised you're sitting on this side of the bleachers and not on the Eagleton side with your new girlfriend Ingrid.
Leslie, I'm just trying to help them.
Why?
They wouldn't help us if the tables were turned.
I mean, they're 50 points ahead, and they're still dunking.
I mean, look at this guy.
There's no way he is in high school.
And I'm better at French horn too, Eric.
People are gonna lose their jobs, Leslie.
And the recovery will take years.
Deep down, I think you feel bad for them.
Okay, I do a little, yes.
And I'm sorry that I blew up at you yesterday.
With all the recall stuff happening, I just really need to feel like you're on my team, and seeing you with them made me feel like you weren't.
I'm always gonna be on your team.
You never have to worry about that.
Defense!
Oh!
Eagleton player number seven, injured on the play.
Official time-out.
Oh, God.
I'm gonna say something.
And if I throw up on you after I say it, just know that you've been warned.
I know how we can help Eagleton.
I don't see what the problem is.
I will give you a certain amount of gold in exchange for a recreational vehicle.
I still need an address for insurance purposes.
This will be my new home.
The address is wherever it is parked.
Where have you been?
I had a flat tire, and I've been trying to get in touch with you for hours.
Sorry, darling.
I've been busy destroying most of my personal effects and threatening a postal worker.
Ron, I know you value your privacy, but you are a husband and a father now.
You can't just roam the streets in an RV and be impossible to find.
I'm on a mission to get off the grid.
Well, you don't have to be entirely on the grid, but have to be on our grid.
I suppose you wouldn't consider moving.
I've heard the school system in the tunnels beneath Yucca Mountain is adequate.
I love you, but your solution to every problem is to live inside a mountain.
I love you too.
Okay, one more time.
Are you absolutely sure you wanna go through with this?
A lot of people are gonna get angry, and you might lose the recall election.
Or, if I pull it off, I just might win.
Plus, a very smart member of my team pointed out it's the right thing to do.
Good morning.
After an all-night strategy session, the towns of Pawnee and Eagleton have come up with a potential solution to Eagleton's budget crisis.
The town of Eagleton will be dissolved and re-absorbed into Pawnee.
Pawnee will provide some government services, as well as taking on some of Eagleton's debts.
I understand.
Look, I hate Eagletonians as much as you do.
I hate their stupid beautiful faces and their stupid shiny hair.
We looked at every alternative.
This is the only scenario that prevents Eagleton's financial crisis from spiraling throughout the entire region.
Eagleton is terrible!
Why should I bail them out with the hard-earned money from my unemployment check?
- Yeah!
- Because they are our neighbor and they've sprained their ankle.
And when your neighbor sprains his ankle, you help him off the court.
I understand you have concerns and questions, and we are here to listen to them.
I got something to say.
One at a time, please.
I hate the one-at-a-time system!
Why should we bail them out?
No one bailed me out when I got arrested for arson.
You can't just merge two towns.
It's against the rules of nature.
What's next-- merging a man with his dog?
I live in Eagleton.
And frankly, I don't like the idea of living in Pawnee.
They're a little-- oh, what's the word?
Have-no-money.
Bertram, that's enough.
First of all, Eagleton has no money.
Second of all, they are gracious enough to throw us a lifeline, and we should be eternally grateful for their generosity.
They're a town of angels-- greasy, denim-clad angels, but angels nonetheless.
Yeah, we'll take it.
I mean, did you steal this from a museum?
Maybe find it frozen in ice?
It looks like the original phone from the movie Wall Street.
I think it's just the original phone, period.
Ew, gross, it has "buttons".
Okay, girls, this is a magic phone, okay?
Only you and I have got the numbers.
So if you ever need Ron for any reason, you just call and he'll be there in a flash.
Yes, I will.
I'll keep it right here.
It snaps right in, snug and secure.
A cell phone belt clip?
No, Ron.
Oh, my God!
Yeah, I can't be seen with you.
Travelin' Ann Perkins!
How was Bloomington?
It was amazing.
They had all the baby supplies we need, and they had all this other cool stuff.
They had a bike-sharing program and a vegan Afghan restaurant and-- Oh, my God.
I'm having one.
- I'm having one right now.
- A contraction?
No.
Dude, I'm, like, three months pregnant.
I-I know.
I'm just so excited.
The thing I'm having is a gut feeling.
What would you think about raising our child somewhere other than Pawnee?
Thank you, Leslie, from all of us in Eagleton.
Our citizens owe you a debt of gratitude.
Well, I think at the end of the day, everybody realizes it's something we have to do.
On the bright side, we did win the basketball game.
I think you owe us some apples.
- You better pay up.
- Oh, you don't want them.
All of Pawnee's apples have been recalled-- - g. Coli.
- You mean e. Coli?
I wish.
Way easier to treat.
Welcome to Pawnee!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
This is a historic day.
At 12:01 this morning, the city of Eagleton ceased to exist and was re-absorbed back into Pawnee.
Things are exactly the way they were back in 1817, except, you know, women and minorities can vote, we have indoor toilets, and we no longer burn widows for learning arithmetic.
Councilwoman Knope is your merger czar, and in the binders that she's provided, you will find directions to your department in Pawnee that most closely matches your department in Eagleton.
There are two Eagleton departments Pawnee does not have: the Department of Infinity Pool Design and the Department of Dressage, which I am told is a fancy horse-riding thing.
It is horse-dancing, madam.
Okay, take it easy, Alonzo.
All you horse dancing people, sit in your saddles if you will.
The rest of you, welcome to your new departments.
Attention: Eagleton is now under martial law.
No.
Okay, Pawnee Parks Department.
Soon, you will be paired up with a person who was roughly your equivalent in Eagleton.
Donna, you'll be with Craig.
April, you'll be with someone named Tynnyfer.
And Ron, your guy is also named Ron.
Guess there's no Tom Haverford equivalent.
Not surprised, I'm one of a kind, just like the custom Nikes I designed that say "Tommy's Tootsies" across the toes.
You do have a counterpart, actually.
His name is Eric, and I've heard he's amazing.
Anyway, I also have a little surprise.
I would like to introduce our new filing temp.
- Hey, everybody.
- No!
No, why?
This can't be happening.
Why, Leslie?
We brought Jerry out of retirement because we have a mountain of filing to get through.
- Welcome back, Jerry Gergic.
- Thank you, Leslie.
And as long as we're starting out fresh, Leslie, I was wondering if people would call me by my real name.
- Larry?
- No, it's not Larry.
It's Jerry.
No, it's Gary.
Your name is Larry, Larry Gengurch.
His name is Larry Gengurch.
Come on, April, it's already hard enough for my family when you call me "Gary".
- Jerry.
- Ha, ha, classic Larry.
Larry.
- Larry, Larry, Larry.
- Aw, jeez.
Look, I'm trying to save as many jobs as possible, but we're gonna have to lose some people.
I'm not sure who we should keep.
April, Tom and Donna are three of the best human beings that have ever lived.
Ron is basically a better version of George Washington.
Butthe Eagletonians are probably good too.
Today, we are not just merging two towns.
We're throwing a birthday party for a new city.
Happy birthday, New Pawnee.
Party's over.
You guys lost millions of taxpayer dollars, and we have to clean up the obscene mess you've made.
You're not as nice as the other guy.
I don't care.
When we were state auditors, we had an amazing system.
Yeah, Chris pumped everyone up and made them feel positive and happy.
And I swooped in and slashed their budgets to ribbons.
Like a majestic alley-oop.
You're all amazing!
You're all fired.
Teamwork.
Hi, you've reached the voicemail of Larry Gengurch.
Please leave your message after the tone.
Well, when Leslie called to see if I could help, Gayle and I were just getting on a cruise ship to the Bahamas.
I said, "Gayle, put that bikini away, because Pawnee needs me".
Oh ho!
Somebody forgot a banana in here--ooh!
Hi, I'm Donna.
Oh, that is the perfect name for you.
I love it.
Never change it!
Wasn't gonna.
You're Craig, right?
Ugh, yes, but I hate that name.
It's so boring.
Sounds like someone's cousin.
Craig!
Craig!
I want to be a Spanish man named Terrence, but that didn't happen.
Okay.
So here's my list of duties.
I'm basically the office manager.
- How about you?
- Oh, I did everything.
Everything!
I carried the Eagleton department on my shoulders for years, and I loved every second of it.
You don't even know!
I'm sorry, was your name Jennifer?
No, it's Tynnyffer with two y's.
I used to be Jennifer, but then I decided to rebrand myself.
Oh, wait, hang on.
It's Xanax o'clock.
Um, well, nice to meet you.
My name's April, and I just wanted to say that your dress is so cute it's bonks.
I saw my spinning instructor wearing it, and I was like, "Shut up.
Where do I get that"?
Oh, my God.
Who's your spinning instructor?
Gregory or Wynona?
I go to Yonis.
Who are Gregory and Wynona?
I've never heard of them before.
- Are they better?
- Wynona rocks my world.
Seriously, you need to get me in there.
Like, that's a must, must, must.
She's the worst person I've ever met.
I want to travel the world with her.
Ron.
Ron.
Last name?
Dunne.
Is that your name, or are you telling me you're finished talking?
Both.
Dunne and done.
I like Ron.
- Hi.
- Well, well, well.
You must be Eric.
I'm Ragiv from I.T.
This is E.R.I.C.
E.R.I.C.
is a computer program?
Stands for Eagleton Reservation Information Center.
It does all the scheduling in Eagleton.
I'm here to install it.
But scheduling's the main part of my job.
You still have a human being in charge of booking tennis courts?
What is this, 1990?
I guess that explains the shoulder pads.
How did he notice these?
Hey, this is a surprise.
Yeah, I just wanted to chat for a sec.
You know, just so you could hear some things from me.
Verbal things from my mouth.
Did that sound weird?
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.
First of all, this is Evelyn.
Oh, hello.
She is my Health Department counterpart from Eagleton.
There really wasn't a ton of work for me there.
Eagletonians are very healthy.
Oh, well, this might be a very interesting challenge for you, because Pawnee has the very first documented case of mega-diabetes.
And the only know occurrence of Lou Gehrig's other disease.
We've been written about in textbooks.
Thanks, Evelyn, I'll see you back in my office.
I just need to talk some more words into Leslie's face.
Nice to meet you.
Ahem.
Wow.
I feel sorry for her.
I mean, nobody can fill your shoes, Ann.
With your tiny little doll feet.
Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, uh, I'm gonna step down, and I'm gonna turn my job over to Evelyn.
What?
No.
Did somebody put you up to this?
Was it Evelyn?
I knew she was a monster.
No.
No, no, no.
Chris and I have been talking, and we are thinking very seriously about leaving Pawnee and moving somewhere else to start our family-- Oh, my God, look at that.
It's waffles!
- Delicious waffles.
- Wait.
Should we try?
Yeah, let's try.
- Huh?
- Mmm.
- Wait, what were you saying?
- Try.
Just enjoy.
Yeah.
There we go.
So, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're telling me you're not thinking about leaving Pawnee.
I am thinking about leaving.
Is this one of those classic Ann "not" jokes?
Like, "I'm leaving Pawneenot"!
I don't do that.
I was hoping that you had started.
It's not definite.
It's just neither of us are from Pawnee.
And I have a whole family in Michigan.
And Chris is missing life in a bigger city.
And I just wanted to talk to you about it so you could hear it from me.
- Do you hear that galloping?
- Hmm?
Wha--oh, my-- look at that!
Joe Biden on a horse shirtless.
That's amazing!
Uh, I've got a ton of work to do.
I'm super busy, so you can let yourself Look, if Ann wants to leave Pawnee, I get it.
I mean, who wants to stay in the greatest town in the world with her best friend and be happy forever when she can abandon her soul sister like an old shoe and move to a garbage city full of jerks.
I get it.
No hard feelings.
- You have to text me.
- I will.
Sorry for the delay, ladies, I was busy being ambushed by treachery.
So did you have a chance to compare notes on your respective duties?
Totally.
Tynny and I have been, like, totally bonding.
We've just been like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!
Like, talking, like, so much forever.
- It was all so delicious.
- I know, right?
This is, like, the best day ever.
I know, I'm eating it all up.
Wow.
It's nice to see a friendship blossoming instead of wiling away like a dying turd flower.
Totes.
Um, we also came up with these nicknames for each other.
Slut and Skank.
How craze-mazing is that, Lez?
Well, you know what I think is craze-mazing?
Commitment.
I'm looking for someone who's in it for the long haul.
We are basically creating a new version of Pawnee, and if Pawnee is gonna commit to one of you, you need to commit to Pawnee.
Tynnyfer, do you have kids?
Ew, no.
I've had so much rejuvenation that I don't think a baby could get out of there if it tried.
You know it.
I guess we can make a switch to Bermuda grass.
It's only 80 cents more per square foot?
What?
Gimme gimme gimme.
You want me to put Bermuda grass in a continental climate that's a six on Beaufort scale?
In a park with zero drainage?
I want Kentucky bluegrass, I want a 10 percent discount, and I want you to apologize to my best friend Donna!
Yeah, hi.
Is there-- and I'm just guessing here-- some kind of medication that you maybe need a lot of and have taken none of or maybe too much of today?
Oh, I have a medical condition all right.
It's called caring too much!
And it's incurable!
Also I have eczema.
Okay, Eagleton Ron, tell me a little about yourself.
Well, I love the outdoors, love nature.
Amen.
I'm a big believer in environmental conservation.
Recycling and composting and the like.
I'm a yoga nut.
And I'm a nut nut.
They make delicious milks, man.
And I'm a vegan, of course.
Slowly working toward full freegan-vegan.
What in God's name is freegan-vegan?
You only eat vegetables that have been thrown out in people's dumpsters.
What is on your foot, sir?
My trusty sandals.
I believe a man's feet should remain uncaged.
Same goes for all chickens.
Well, Eagleton Ron, we here in Pawnee value loyalty above all else.
So would you be opposed to signing an official loyalty pledge to our new town?
As long as that new town were open to the ideals of communal living, everyone pitches in towards a common good.
In the immortal words of Cat Stevens, "If you want to be free, be free".
I no longer like Ron.
E.R.I.C.
is an amazing program.
Fast, fun and easy to use.
But there's one thing no man or machine can beat Tom Haverford at-- talking mad trash till I get what I want.
This guy Eric is a disaster.
- What do you mean?
- Just a bad attitude.
"Oh, I hate this place.
Get me out here".
That kind of thing.
And unreliable.
And racist.
I think he may have even been to jail.
Although, you know, maybe those are just regular face tattoos.
Wow.
That's not good.
I should probably talk to him.
Well, let me see if can turn him around.
I don't want to put this on your plate.
You have a lot to deal with.
Thanks, Tom.
You're the best.
Okay, let's take a look at this list of assets owned by the Eagleton government.
Sell 'em.
They're gone.
You had six full-time baristas on the payroll.
The baristas are gone.
As are the masseurs.
And the full-time barista who provided coffee for the masseurs.
It is excellent having the old band back together again.
You know what?
This calls for some celebratory lunges.
One two All right, Donna.
There's gonna have to be some cutbacks.
I mean, your job is secure, of course.
You're basically the glue of this department.
But I think Craig's gonna have to go.
No, you should keep him.
He's crazy intense, but I've never met anyone who cares more about this job.
Uh, Donna, I'm right here.
No joke.
He might care more than you.
Honestly, if I had to choose between him and me, - I'd choose him.
- Wait, what are you saying?
Are you thinking about leaving?
I wasn't planning on it, but I could.
You know, I got the condo in Seattle, the fiance in Denver.
- Huh?
- It won't last.
Leslie, I would be happy to go back into retirement if you have to cut the staff.
What?
Even Larry wants out?
What the hell is happening here?
Does everybody think that running a town is just some game where people can come and go as they please?
Okey-dokey, Leslie.
You're mad at me.
Don't take it out on everybody else.
- It's not fair.
- I'll tell you what's not fair.
I'm gonna have to watch the Oscars with Ben alone this year.
Last year, don't you remember Angelina Jolie and the leg dress moment?
He had, and I quote, "no comment".
How can you not have an extreme reaction about a dress like that?
It just doesn't make any sense!
- Okay, we need to talk.
- I'm sorry, Ann.
I can't understand you.
You've developed some accent from that new town you might move to!
It seems like no one around here understands the meaning of loyalty.
I am the merger czar.
I make the rules.
And I'm gonna teach people the meaning of loyalty in a language they will understand-- complicated legalese.
Knope, what are these contracts?
It's just a little something that I drew up for all the employees of the new town.
Basic boilerplate language, blah, blah, blah.
I'm so sorry, honey, but Tynny and I won't sign anything until we speak with our life coach.
When Eric saw this, he smashed a bunch of computers.
- Why are you doing this?
- What's the big deal?
I'm just trying to stop time with legally-binding friendship contracts.
What part of that do you not understand?
You have lost your mind.
I think you need a spa day, Les.
Fine!
You only have to work here until I'm dead!
Is that better?
What in the name of all that is holy is that smell?
Yerba matte tea.
Sweetened with stevia.
It's an all-natural plant extract.
Shut your damn mouth.
No need to curse.
There most certainly is.
Okay, all Eagleton people meet me in the conference room.
All Pawnee people, sit at your desks.
And take it personally.
I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot, so I made unity cookies with the Pawnee town's original colors of blue and yellow.
However, I did not have yellow frosting, so I had to use mustard.
But do not worry.
I put tons of sugar on them, so it will even it out.
Mmm!
Sugar mustard.
That's awful kind of you, Leslie, but I'm afraid those are a little too sweet for me.
I unhooked from that big sugar train over 30 years ago.
You are a man of principle and I respect that, cool Ron.
So, what's your story, new Ann?
You're kind of pretty.
I mean, you're not "Ann" pretty, but you have potential.
Thank you, but I-I don't work in this department.
Shut your kind of pretty mouth and, uh, eat a mustard cookie.
Okay, so let's chit-chat, huh?
Let's get to know each other and then become familiar best friends.
I don't have time for this.
I'm halfway through designing a bamboo gazebo as a tribute to the founders of Motown.
That's so Craig.
Oh, Craig!
We have fun, don't we?
Do you guys remember when this all started and I came in here with the cookies, and then Craig said something so Craig and we all laughed, and we were like, "Craig"!
Do you think it would be weird if we held hands?
- Probably.
- This way, please.
Excuse me, Ron, I am talking to my best friends.
Let me go!
Best friends, attack Ron!
Ben, it has been an honor watching you work today.
It's been like watching Leonardo work.
Da Vinci or DiCaprio.
You're that good.
Thanks, man.
I was in the zone today.
This really has been a lot of fun.
The old juice is back!
Hey, should we keep this going?
Celebratory dinner, just like the old days?
Ben, that's a great idea.
Hey, you know what?
I know who I'm gonna use to calculate tax and tip.
Me?
Can I just say something?
I'm having so much fun right now.
Oh, my God, me too.
Like, so much fun.
Can I just say something, though?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
You don't want this job.
Seriously, this place is the pits.
It's like, if you worked here, you'd be like, "Ugh"!
And Leslie would be like, "Blah, blah, blah".
And you'd be like, "Uh" Okay, can I say something?
Right now, I totally think that you're right, and I had been thinking about going someplace warm while my husband is in jail.
Oh, my God!
Can I just say something?
- Yes!
- Okay.
You should totally stay at my house in Miami.
- What?
- I'm serious.
Come by anytime.
Just let yourself in.
The gate kind of jams sometimes, but you can just jump it.
You are so amazing right now.
You're like skinny Mother Theresa.
It's Dwayne Wade's house.
I got his address off the Internet.
I really hope he's there when she walks in and he throws a basketball at her head.
Okay, enough is enough.
What is wrong with you, woman?
I don't need to explain myself to you!
I am the czar.
I can do as I please.
Those who cross the czar feel the wrath of the czar!
Ann is thinking about leaving Pawnee.
Moving, with Chris.
Well, that's nice.
Nice, Ron?
Edible arrangements are nice.
This is volcanically hot betrayal!
She is my best friend!
She's thinking about leaving, just like that!
And she wants to "talk to me" about it?
It's like, I don't even know what to say.
That you love her and you understand that it's her life, and geography will never change your feelings.
Whatever.
I don't even need her.
I've got Tynnyfer now, and Craig, and Eric, the racist drug dealer who I've yet to meet.
Those are my real friends.
You can't force friendship, Leslie.
It takes time.
I once thought I had a friend.
Then it turned out he was the single worst person I have ever met.
I agree with Ron, Leslie.
It's like Moz once said.
"Hold on to your friends".
Morrissey.
The Smiths.
You don't know Meat Is Murder?
It's one of the best songs ever written about industrialized beef consumption.
Okay, Eagleton Ron.
I think it might be time for you to go.
This Ron has the position pretty much locked up, and, uh, I don't think we have any room for you in our department.
Fair enough.
I should have seen it.
Taurus and Capricorns never mix, do they?
Just remember, Ron.
Giving in to hate is like drinking saltwater.
The thirst only grows worse.
Leslie, remove this man before I commit an act of violence against him.
Whatever you do, I won't fight back.
After I defeated him in an epic struggle, E.R.I.C.
is gone.
He's been replaced by T.O.M.-- Town-wide Organizational Matrix.
Big plans tonight, Craig?
No, I have a ton of work to do.
Plus, my DVR is 13 months pregnant with episodes of Scandal.
Scandal's my favorite show.
I love every character, except for Mellie.
Oh!
Of course you like Scandal!
Because you're amazing!
I love you.
And no matter what happens with this job, I will always love you.
Excuse me!
Who even are you?
How's your salad?
Well, it's called the "Good Earth Salad," but really, it's just cheese, toffee, and gummy bear worms.
This town is really unhealthy.
You know, I forgot that this part of being accounting bros was actually pretty depressing.
I mean, after the intense, almost meth-like high of solving accounting puzzles, we were always just beat at the end of the day.
I actually think it's something else.
Back in the day, this was all we had.
We'd go into a town, we'd fix problems.
We'd go back to some rundown motel.
Yeah, you'd exercise.
I'd re-watch Twin Peaks, then hit the Twin Peaks message boards and read The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer to find Easter Eggs I'd missed.
But now, Ann and Leslie are our real partners.
Yeah.
It's a good thing.
But you were a fine surrogate before we found them.
Just so you know, we're thinking of moving.
Don't know where yet.
Maybe Michigan, to be with Ann's family.
Wow.
That makes me kind of sad.
But also incredibly happy for you and Ann.
We have come a long way.
Something healthy!
A cherry tomato.
Nope.
A gumball.
Ooh!
What I really want to say is, I'm sorry.
You're my best friend.
This whole thing is just scary and confusing.
I love you.
I want to talk about this, all of this, whatever it means.
Was that okay?
I guess it's good.
Again, I barely know you or Ann, so I don't have much to go off of.
- Well - Hey, Leslie.
Hey.
Uh, you are excused, Fake Ann.
That was six hours well spent.
I thank you.
Looks like you've made all your decisions.
Well, almost.
What were you talking to Evelyn about?
Nothing.
It's not important.
The only thing that's important is you.
I'm ready to talk about this.
I want to talk about this.
Is now a good time?
Yes.
Now is a great time.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Hey, I've gained a lot of ground in the polls.
That's good news.
Yeah, I have you down only four points, but they're running a ton of new negative ads.
Maybe you should fight back.
Ben, your heart's in the right place.
Your heart and your butt.
I will not go negative.
Crap on a turd!
Care for a "Recall Knope" gift bag?
The committee to recall Leslie Knope is relentless.
Look what they're handing out at elementary schools.
I'm Leslie Knope.
Tell your parents to recall me.
We all know that I cannot spend as much money on ads as my opponent, but I printed out 10,000 "Don't" stickers and 10,000 question mark stickers.
That way, if you see a sign and it says "Recall Knope," all you need to do is add the question mark and the "Don't," and suddenly, it reads, "Recall Knope?
Don't".
Why don't you just put the "Don't" in front of "Recall Knope"?
Yep, that's a much better idea.
Can I have these question mark stickers?
Why?
I want to put them on stop signs.
April, no!
Hi.
Um, I need to talk to somebody about reserving a park.
Oh, we have a new policy.
Parks can only be reserved for witch covens or slip-and-slide competitions.
Which one are you?
Uh, slip-and-slide competition.
- Seriously?
- No.
Why would you even compete in something like that?
It doesn't matter.
Um, I called earlier about the free vaccinations thing.
We're hoping to set up a mobile hospital in one of your parks.
I'm sorry, is there something wrong with him?
Tom, this witch wants to reserve a park for her satanic ritual.
Can you help her?
Right.
Smashing.
Uh, yes, I'm Thomas Haverford.
I sort of run the whole department.
Um, what was the name, then?
Uh, Nadia Statsky.
I'm from Doctors Without Borders.
Brilliant.
The old "D"s without "B"s.
Uh, we can definitely help.
Yeah, Tom's your guy.
He actually used to run the Parks Department in his home country of Russia.
This one is mental.
She's joking, obviously.
How could I be from Russia?
Not with this spot-on British accent.
We can definitely get you sorted.
Right this way.
Okay.
Whoa.
I am pretty sure you shouldn't have a weapon at work.
Literally everything is a weapon, son.
That folder, in my hands, is far deadlier than this bow in yours.
Oh, that's probably true.
So, Leslie and I just finished putting together our will, and she wants you to be the witness.
You mind signing it?
That's your will?
You need that many pages to say, "Give my stuff to my wife"?
It's a complicated legal document.
It doesn't have to be.
I've had the same will since I was eight years old.
"Upon my death, all of my belongings "shall transfer to the man or animal who has killed me".
What are these weird symbols?
The man who kills me will know.
Okay, you should really have a will that's more than one sentence long.
You have a wife and kids now.
I could introduce you to our lawyer.
The three most useless jobs in the world are, in order, lawyer, congressman, and doctor.
Pass.
Ron, that document is nothing.
It's not even notarized.
You know, if you die and you don't have a real will, most of what you own will go to the government.
Where is this lawyer you speak of?
I'm pleased to formally submit Bill 68-J, which funds a new bike path in Ramsett Park.
- Motion to table this bill.
- Second.
- I also submit Bill 68-R.
- Motion to table.
Second.
You guys want to delay all my bills?
Fine.
I'm just gonna keep my head down and continue to get work done.
All right, well, uh, motion to end this session early so nothing can get done.
Second.
Gahhh, you guys are the worst!
Sorry, Knope.
We're just looking for any possible way to get you recalled because we don't like you.
- It's nothing personal.
- It absolutely is personal.
That is the definition of "personal".
"The definition of personal".
Excuse me, we have an issue.
A tweet has been tweeted from the Parks and Rec Twitter, and I'm afraid it is quite sexually graphic.
It's probably just some bored teenager who hacked the account.
Whoever it is, it's quite serious.
I don't want you to get recalled Knope, but damn, these people know how to pick a neck massager.
And before you get on my case about those stickers, I already did 'em.
Donna, there is trouble a-brewin'.
We think that you may have accidentally tweeted from the Parks and Rec account rather than your own personal account.
Uh-oh.
What'd it say?
"See you tonight.
"Hope you like tongue baths, you big, nasty fireman".
Then there's a picture of a pair of lips and then a picture of an eggplant.
I'm both confused, and if we're being totally honest, a little aroused.
Ew.
Not to give you too much of a peek into my personal life, but this could have been way worse.
What's important is, we deleted the tweet, and nobody is gonna know it's you, but Donna, you know, be more careful in the future.
This almost blew up in my face.
I'm here live, at a press conference, where Councilman Jeremy Jamm will discuss a government scandal we are calling "Twitter Watergate" until we can find a snappier name for it.
Tongue baths?
Eggplants?
Firemen?
Those men are heroes who deserve respect!
This is how Leslie Knope runs her Parks Department?
We are going to hold hearing after hearing, until we are satisfied.
This will be blown way out of proportion!
You have my word on it!
Ugh.
Ooh, this is bad.
I'm gonna get fired.
No one is getting fired, okay?
Jamm is trying to use this to hurt me in the recall.
He's trying to take me down, and he's willing to attack my friends in the process?
- No.
No way.
Not on my watch.
- Not on her watch.
He is not gonna sully your name.
No sullying allowed!
Don't worry about it, Donna.
We're gonna nip this in the bud.
Guard your buds, 'cause they're about to get nipped!
- Okay.
- Okay.
So, why does Doctors Without Borders want to come to Pawnee?
Pawnee is like a petri dish of weird diseases.
Did you know you have a higher rate of the West Nile virus than the actual Western Nile?
Sorry, West Nile, looks like Pawnee wins again.
What else have you beaten the Western Nile in?
Cricket.
Uh just fill out these forms, and we will be all set like two biscuits inside a tin.
So, you've gone insane.
That's fun.
I just panicked.
She's so out of my league, my brain just made me talk that way so I'd seem cooler.
What should I do?
Nothing!
This is amazing.
- April.
- Fine.
If you want to have a chance with her, obviously, you have to stop.
It's either that, or you talk like that for the rest of your life.
You think she'd marry me?
All right, just let me do the talking here, okay?
I mean, he's a lawyer, I'm an accountant.
We speak the same language.
I mean, obviously, accountants are a little more bad boy, but, uh, there's a respect there.
- When will this be over?
- Hey, Trevor.
I've been talking to Ron about estate planning, and he is here to do some "Good Will Hunting".
Because he has to draw up a new will, so-- Yes, I understood, Mr. Wyatt.
Thank you.
As I've said before, I just don't like puns.
Oh, well, my accountant friends seem to enjoy 'em.
Mr. Swanson, let's begin by filling out this form, listing your assets and liabilities.
Nice try.
I'm not telling you how much money I have, where it's hidden, or which precious metals and/or gemstones it may or may not take the form of.
If you don't give me the information I need, there's nothing I can do.
Oh, come on, Trevor.
Where there's a "Will," there's a way.
I'm gonna say this one last time, Wyatt.
Check the accountant crap at the door.
Yes, sir, I will.
Unintentional.
All right, let's begin.
These hearings have two goals.
One, to find out exactly how this offensive tweet came to be sent.
And two, to turn this whole thing into a media circus.
Ms. Knope, do you have a statement?
Well, it's actually quite simple.
Uh, a Parks and Rec employee forgot to log out of the Parks and Rec Twitter account, they posted a personal, of the Parks and Rec private message by accident, and, uh, that person is very sorry, and it won't happen again.
Stop stonewalling and tell us what happened here!
I just told you what happened.
It was an unfortunate mistake.
Okay, sadly, due to your "intracksidence"-- Not a word.
We may never find out what happened.
When this sick, depraved tweet first came to light, you said, "The account was probably hacked by some bored teenager".
Now you're saying it's an unfortunate mistake.
Why do you keep flip-flopping?
Well, because I learned new information.
When I was four, I thought that chocolate milk came from brown cows, and then I flip-flopped when I found out that there was something called chocolate syrup.
I don't think I'm out of line when I say that this scandal makes Benghazi look like whitewater!
It's utterly meaningless.
I think we need to hear from the unnamed employee behind the tweet.
- Perhaps he or she-- - Or them.
It could be a bunch of hot ladies.
Yes, perhaps "them" can finally give us the answers we need.
What, what, what?
There she is.
Nadia, I didn't know what you wanted, so I got you a cappuccino, a latte, four bags of coffee beans, and a mini espresso machine.
What happened to your accent?
Oh, yeah.
It's gone.
Huh.
You know, I had a cold recently.
I think that may have affected my voice, like, in certain British ways.
Well, that's all there is to that story, so no need for any more questions.
You have a cold?
Can I feel your glands?
Sure.
Wow, you are wearing a lot of moisturizer on your throat.
Best way to prevent crow's neck.
Is this glitter?
So, those are the forms.
You filled 'em out.
Great.
April's gonna file these.
Hey, when is the thing you're doing in the park?
I'd love to come by and maybe help administer vaccines?
Oh.
Are you a doctor, somehow?
No.
No follow-up to that?
Okay, great.
Um, well, I'm not actually gonna be attending the event, so if you could just give me the permit, so that I can go home to Indianapolis and never come back here?
I am in love with Nadia Whatever-her-last-name-is, and I'm gonna keep her here, using the most powerful weapon I have-- bureaucratic incompetence.
Oh, no.
You filled out Form 3208.
You were supposed to fill out Form 3248.
Oh, God.
This is to lease a hangar at the airport.
I know.
It's so crazy, it almost sounds made up.
Bureaucracy, right?
What are you gonna do?
Huh.
Weird.
Someone left out a blender, fresh fruits, and rum?
I guess we gotta, like, make Daiquiris now.
I like to have music on while I work, you know?
What is this place?
Ms. Meagle, let me first say that I am a big fan of your writing.
Thank you.
It's good stuff.
Really good stuff.
Okay, does anyone else here see a double standard?
Councilman Dexhart is currently being sued by two different women for sexual harassment, one of whom was the judge in the first woman's trial.
She was talking dirty to me.
She was reading the emails that you sent to the first woman.
Look, I obviously never meant to embarrass the parks department.
My personal account is set to "private".
Yeah, I don't even know what she writes on there!
Well, you may not know what she's writing, but we do.
In a shocking twist to an already juicy story, we have obtained access to Ms. Meagle's account, via a third party.
Same hairdresser.
Damn it, Typhoon!
Why'd you do this?
Maybe if you had bothered to come to my Great Gatsby Brunch, you'd know.
I don't even need an exact number.
Just ballpark it.
That's all I need to get started.
Or, I'm sure the state government would love to use your money to hire more bureaucrats, maybe build a library.
Fine, a ballpark figure.
Thank you.
God.
Holy .
Is this a joke?
Another word for "jokes" is "lies".
I do not lie.
Therefore, I do not joke.
Mr. Swanson, an estate of this size means that your children would never have to work a day in their lives.
This is going to take some time.
Trusts need to be drawn, tax shelters.
That's enough.
I do not need some drawn-out legal expedition to tell me what I knew when I was eight.
Here's my original will.
Do whatever lawyer nonsense you have to to make it official, and I will sign it.
Good day.
Wait.
What are all these symbols?
I was right not to be threatened by you.
Okay, I would like to enter into the record a selection of Ms. Meagle's tweets.
Uh-oh.
Uh, can I request a brief recess?
It's okay, Donna.
I'm not gonna let them fire you.
Yeah, it's not me I'm worried about.
Ms. Beavers, if you please.
Yesterday, 9:02 A.M. "Annoying-ass Leslie "has given me another annoying-ass task.
stickers, bitchboss".
September 25th.
"Twitter poll: On a scale of 98 to 100, "how annoying is Leslie Knope?
"Cuz u know it ain't less than 98.
All my #trueblood fans know what's up".
Page after page of personal attacks on Leslie Knope.
Not only do you have no control over your department, you don't even have the respect of your employees.
That's what you really think of me?
You think I'm annoying?
Leslie, sometimes you're kind of annoying.
I mean, I thought that was your thing.
My thing?
My thing is not being annoying.
My things are making friendship bracelets and dancing like nobody's watching, thinking up really cool nicknames for my friends.
You of all people should know that, El Diablo!
Look, the only reason I'm even on Twitter is to blow off steam about work and tweet nasty stuff to dudes with washboard abs.
You really think I hate you, after all we've been through the last ten years?
I honestly don't know anymore.
Okay, I think we've done a lot of good here today.
Leslie, I am sorry, but I could not postpone these pointless hearings that Jamm is having.
He is just determined.
Well, thank you for trying.
I have a question for you.
Do you think I'm annoying?
- No.
- Are you lying?
- No.
- Are you trying to protect my feelings?
No.
Do you think I'm being annoying right now?
- Yes.
- So you do think I'm annoying.
I think that you ask a lot of the people that you work with, and I think that people do what you ask because they love you.
But, I also think that driving people as hard as you do can ruffle some feathers.
I think a lot of things.
I like thinking.
And racquetball.
Now who's annoying?
I spent the last hour reading some of Donna's old tweets, and it turns out there are some more things that she said about you.
"Message to the recall haters: "You can't keep Leslie Knope down.
"She's too real for this ish.
bossbitch".
"Leslie Knope is stepping up at these hearings "and taking a bullet for me.
sisterfromanothermister, bossbitch".
It appears, whereas "bitch boss" is clearly an indication of her frustration, "boss bitch" is a term of endearment.
Isn't language fun?
It's like racquetball for your mouth!
Did you change your outfit?
I changed five times, and she hasn't noticed yet.
I can only stall for so long.
What should I do?
Um, I just finished filling this one out.
I didn't know what to put for "Name of commercial airline," because I do not operate a commercial airline, so I just made one up.
What did you name your imaginary airline?
"Jet Blue Ivy".
I figure Jay-Z and Beyonce's kid will own her own airline eventually.
She's the one.
So, can I have my permit now?
Finally?
Uh, no, there was a mistake, and we gave the park to someone else.
What?
Maybe I can drive you around and we'll pick another one?
Maybe I'll bring a picnic lunch.
Do you like tamales?
You said that that park was ours.
You said it a long time ago, in a British accent.
I probably shouldn't say this, as a doctor.
It's probably not cool.
But I really hope you all get West Nile virus.
Nice meeting you, April.
Kind of.
You're weird too.
Thank you.
We need to talk.
That has never been true.
I think I know what's happening.
Thinking about how to divide up your possessions for when you die, it's tough, confronting your own mortality, and I think it's got you spinning a little bit.
Am I right?
Wow.
I had not considered that.
Yes, I think that maybe you are on to something.
Yeah.
Just know that it's perfectly healthy to be thinking about-- Oh, you're joking.
Yes, son, I am.
First joke ever.
Don't care for it.
Death does not scare me.
What I am worried about is spoiling my children.
I don't want 'em to be the kind of people who never work, live off their trust funds, who buy their wooden furniture.
I will leave my children $50 apiece for the cab home from my funeral and a steak dinner, end of discussion.
Okay.
I mean, look, it doesn't matter how much money you leave your kids.
What matters is that you teach them the right values.
But, if something horrible happens, and you want your kids to be left alone with no safety net, just so they can learn some kind of weird lesson, then, by all means, leave your fortune to the wild boar who gores you to death.
I'd never lose to a boar.
I'm sorry if I can be little annoying at times, but one person's annoying is another person's inspiring and heroic, so, you know, who are we to judge?
And I'm sorry for writing those things.
Some of those things.
I can't promise that I won't be inspiring and heroic in the future.
And I can't promise that I won't complain about it.
Deal.
I got you an apology present.
Oh!
It is all of your favorite lipsticks and nail polishes, and I got the same ones too.
I printed out a schedule, so we can wear them at the same time.
Now, I would like you to open each one in front of me, and tell me how you feel about them individually.
Let me take a picture.
Are you tweeting this?
Mm-hmm.
What's the hashtag gonna be?
"Boss bitch" or "bitch boss"?
Yeah, it's "psycho boss".
Eh, I don't hate that.
Benjamin, after thinking about what you said, I've decided to leave each of my children Wow, 5 whole percent.
So, I guess you are gonna teach them a lesson.
Oh, my God, that's 5%?
That is a lot of money.
Wait, is this a joke?
It is not a joke.
Not that an accountant would know the difference.
Also, if something should happen to Diane and me, we decided that the kids should go to the most important people in our lives.
Ron, I'm--I'm incredibly flattered.
Ralph Piatkowski and his wife Helen.
He's the Maitre D' at Mulligan's Steakhouse, and he knows me better than anyone.
However, if they are not able to do it, which seems likely, as they're in their 90s, you and Leslie are choice number two.
I'm honored.
Everyone, take your seats, so this witch hunt may proceed as scheduled.
Speaking of, uh, where are the witches?
They're right here!
Well, we're not witches.
That's sexist and offensive.
But we're right here, and we are not gonna sit in this room and let you drag our names through the mud just to score some cheap political points.
How dare you demean the value of the political points I'm scoring?
We have had enough.
I am going back to work so I can do some good for this town, and my friend Donna is coming with me.
Hmm.
I prefer "El Diablo".
Uh, this is not over, Ms. Knope!
Donna, quit punishing me!
- I miss you.
- Uh-uh!
Bridge burned, Typhoon.
Or should I say, "Norman"?
Uh-huh.
Okay, I'm just gonna man up, tell her how I feel, and hope she feels the same way about me, and that's that.
If she doesn't, no big deal.
It's done.
I'm an adult.
Let's do it.
Great.
Nope, I can't do it.
New plan.
Tell her all the screw-ups were your fault.
I'll tell her I had to cover for you, because you are so dumb.
Nadia!
We're very sorry for everything you went through today.
I have reserved the park for your event.
Now, April has something she'd like to admit.
Tom wants me to tell you that all the screw-ups were my fault, but really, he kept messing up so that you would stay in Pawnee as long as possible because he is super into you.
Okay.
Several questions.
- Is any part of him British?
- No.
So, that was just weird, panicky dude behavior?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I'm just trying to figure out if acting that insane is, like, romantic, or totally scary.
I'll go with romantic.
He is kind of cute.
What's his deal?
He's sweet, he's cool, and you're, like, way out of his league, so there's literally no risk for you at all here.
Okay.
Well, I am going to Rwanda in, like, two weeks for my job, so, what the hell?
Cool.
So, you want to go out with me?
Yes, please.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay, you owe me, like, 1,000 favors.
See ya.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Are you getting ready with Andy in London?
You look lovely.
I'm going to murder you a thousand times.
Okay.
What the hell?
Someone's back from London, no, it's not the queen someone's back from London, it's not Mr. Bean Oh, my God.
It's not the royal baby, I think his name is Jeff Stop singing!
Kiss me!
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?
Just missed you so bad, honey, I bought myself a ticket home.
You're never gonna need that computer again 'cause I'm home for, like, 19 hours.
This is so sweet.
Just like the old days.
Take a hike, Jerry.
It's Larry now.
Okay, take a hike, Larry.
Next order of business, Councilman Jamm proposes Bill 949-c.
That's right, stretch, and looking mighty fly in that suit, brother.
Okay, this excellent bill only allows someone to vote in a Pawnee election, for example, the upcoming recall election, if their I.D. lists an official Pawnee address.
Really, councilman?
Again?
The recall election is coming up, and Jamm keeps trying to figure out ways to screw me over.
Last week, he tried to have me listed on the ballot as "Leslie Buttface Hitler the Fourth".
All you're trying to do is disenfranchise the people from former Eagleton, people who will most likely vote for me because I saved a lot of their jobs.
I move that we table the discussion until after the election.
- Second.
- Thank you!
- Ah!
- I'm so sorry.
I just get excited when you like me.
I put my career on the line by saving Eagleton, and he's trying to rob me of their votes?
Those are my votes.
I've earned them!
I want them!
Give me those votes!
I don't have them on me.
I can't believe Jamm tried to pull that crap.
I can.
He's a horrible monster.
But let's focus on the more important issue.
You want to squeeze in one more practice session?
Oh, do I?
Tonight, I am throwing Ben his dream birthday party, a roller skating bash with an early '90s theme.
Ben lives for the early '90s.
The music, the fashion.
It's his favorite era.
As for the roller skating-- I have a thing for women in skates.
Okay?
Everyone has a thing, and that's mine.
As far as things go, it's pretty innocuous.
Could be one of those dudes that kisses mannequins or whatever, but I like a woman in skates.
A lot.
Hey, Ann, Ann called.
She wants her ugly outfit back.
Why are you dressed as a pilgrim?
Leslie said it was a "Come As You Were in the '90s" party.
I assumed it was the 1690s.
Babe, if it was the 1690s, we'd all be mummies.
What do you think mummies are?
Skeletons?
- Oh, boy.
- Hey.
I just came straight from work, so I couldn't dress up.
No problem.
You look wiggidy-wiggidy- wiggidy-wiggidy-wonderful.
Wait a minute.
Pants on backwards.
Kris Kross, right?
Nice!
What happens when you have to pee?
I actually just went.
I had to pull my pants all the way to the ground like a toddler.
Nadia, the super hot doctor, has been hanging out with me for the last week.
She's definitely out of my league.
Actually, we're not even playing the same sport.
It's kind of like she's in NBA and I work at a muffler store next to the stadium.
I can't believe we met just before you have to go on your stupid vacation.
I'm doing doctors without borders, man.
I'm going to Rwanda.
Exactly.
That's a stupid vacation.
Okay, well, why don't you win me that huge-ass bear as a going-away present?
No problem.
I'm a skee ball master.
No way!
Why don't you go pro?
I don't know.
I didn't want to be a cliche.
Yet another professional Indian skee ball player?
Right.
Now that's what I call shooting.
Is this a hunting game?
Yeah, it's fun.
You want to play?
Indeed, I do.
If you'd like, I could offer you some pointers.
Hunting, Donna, is about silence, balance, and patience.
Get ready.
You know you're supposed to hit the deer, right?
Ugh!
Get it together, Swanson.
Well, the game is absurd.
This gun is lightweight, there's no sight, and we are far too close to these deer.
Would they not smell us?
I want my money back.
How do I get my quarters?
Oh, my God!
You are such a sore loser.
I am not a sore loser.
It's just that I prefer to win, and when I don't, I get furious.
Employee!
Whoa!
Watch this.
Oh, that was brilliant.
Sorry.
You probably don't know what that means.
You know how you Americans say "cool" when something's cool?
Over in London, we say, "That's brilliant".
Speaking of London, you haven't told me anything about work.
- You still love it?
- Yeah, it's awesome.
I'm kicking ass.
I'm like Chuck Norris, only instead of crushing bad guys' skulls, I'm crushing documents.
- That's great.
- Yeah.
Now be the Chuck Norris of making out with me.
I'll karate punch your face with my tongue.
- Prove it.
- Hi-yah.
Get this.
I just asked the DJ what REM albums he has.
He's got Monster, but not Automatic For the People.
- Wow!
- I know.
It's like, what is this?
A mid-'90s party?
No.
It's an early '90s party.
Okay, Larry.
Tell us how this looks.
Ben wants to do a synchronized couple skate to Losing My Religion.
Hit it!
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
I'm sorry, but we have a problem.
His name is Jeremy Jamm.
Well, as noted in Article nine, Paragraph two-- Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Jamm, I thought this bill was tabled?
Yes, and I called a special session and un-tabled it.
What's up with the roller skates?
I was about to attend a roller skating birthday party for my husband, but this is more important.
Yeah, I don't care.
I'm a blades guy.
Point of order!
The councilwoman wishes to speak on this issue.
Will the councilwoman yield her time so we can vote on this sucker?
No, I will not yield.
Nor will I yield for the rest of the evening.
A filibuster?
Are you dookin' on my chest right now?
No!
Gross!
And yes, it's a filibuster.
Okay?
I am not willing to let you deprive me-- She's filibustering on roller skates?
She's gonna be strapped into those things for hours.
I know this is a dire situation, but I swear to God, this is like a crazy sex fantasy for me.
How goes it?
Pretty good, except I suck at skee ball.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause if you don't win me that bear, you're dead to me.
Understood.
Hey, man, how many tickets for that bear, again?
- 40,000.
- 40,000?
Oh, brother.
All right, you're gonna be my lookout for a second.
Hey, is he allowed to do that?
No!
Get off the ramp, dude!
Hey!
You're supposed to be my lookout.
I thought it'd be funnier to watch you get busted.
Hey, you're a doctor.
You know snitches get stitches.
I remember the first time I voted.
I was in my bedroom, and I was five.
I voted for Mildred, my stuffed pig, but my cat, pancakes, won.
She had more funding.
Politics, right?
What are you gonna do?
How long have I been talking?
Three hours?
No, eight minutes.
Okay.
Maybe you should yield the floor.
Milton doesn't have a lot of time-- left on earth.
Hey, just kidding, bud.
Will someone open my crackers?
The session ends at 11:00 P.M.
She has to talk the whole time.
She can't lean on anything for support, and no one else can help her.
Three strikes and she is done.
This is literally the most exciting thing that I've ever seen.
I mean, think about it.
Where else on earth would you rather spend your birthday with Leslie?
Well, maybe the birthday party she's throwing for me right now.
Everyone in Pawnee should have the right to vote.
Whoa!
As I dissect this important and profound statement, I'm just gonna take these off for a second.
Bam, strike one.
No sitting.
Is the gong really necessary?
Yes, it is.
I love Chinese crap.
Lucy Liu, Nintendo, Gangnam Style, sushi, et cetera, et cetera.
Also, more importantly, it's in the rules.
No sitting.
Okay, fine.
Well, the strike is worth it if I can take these off.
Oh, man!
Oh, my God!
I had this exact bear when I was a kid!
- Excuse me.
- Uh-huh.
How much does this bear cost?
Okay, well, let's just assume that I'm an adult who doesn't have two weeks to play arcade games.
What about 50 bucks?
Yeah.
Just don't tell my boss.
- What are you doing, Morris?
- Nothing, Mr. Bonderman.
- Tuck in your shirt.
God!
- Sorry.
Oh!
You feeling it?
Wow.
You suck at this.
Donna, please back up two paces so I can physically destroy this machine.
Can you chill a little, man?
It's not real hunting.
It's just a game.
That you happen to suck at.
You know what?
That's a good point.
What?
That you suck at this?
That it's not real hunting.
Come with me.
I don't want you to go back to London.
Just remember, every time you look up at the moon, I, too, will be looking at a moon.
Not the same moon, obviously.
That's impossible.
See you on stupid Skype.
I'm proud of Andy.
This is the first time he's really gone out on a limb.
I knew if he found something that he actually liked doing, he'd be happy, so I'm-- What the hell?
Wha-- Hey!
Perkins!
What are you doing with my bear?
I've been playing skee ball for, like, two hours trying to win that for Nadia.
I just bought it for 50 bucks.
When I was a kid, I taught myself how to make out on this bear, pretended it was Cockroach from The Cosby Show.
Hey, what's going on here?
Why does blossom have my bear?
I bought it for myself, but apparently, he was trying to win it for you, so I'm sorry.
I still got some tickets, though.
I could get you, uh, a ninja turtle balloon or Cliffhanger on VHS.
Oh, that's so sweet, but you're basically offering me garbage.
Let's just skate.
That bear was the only thing she was gonna have to remember me by in Rwanda.
And if I know anything about Rwanda, and I don't, I bet it's full of rich guys who'll buy her whatever she wants.
Hunting.
No quarters required.
Hang on.
Do you have a license to hunt at night?
'Cause you need a license.
I thought you were serious.
Come on now.
You know I don't give a .
As Ronald Reagan would say, "Well, mommy, I believe voting rights are important".
Does anyone else think it's hot in here?
These overalls are really starchy.
Yeah, maybe that's 'cause I turned up the heat to 90, and, uh, oh, the knob broke off in my hand.
Oops.
Well, speaking of heat, we should discuss America's white-hot passion for voting rights and the men and women who help protect them, like the local city councilwoman who is starving and thinking about her husband's Reservoir Dog- themed birthday cake and wanting to eat it really badly.
Oh, this is not a good sign.
Once she starts thinking about birthday cake, she's basically useless until she eats birthday cake.
Democracy is not unlike a cake.
It's layered, delicious, chocolate, and I want some.
Okay, she's fading.
Ben, we need to find a way to smuggle some mineral oil drops onto her tongue.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Excuse me.
What the hell are you people doing here?
We represent the citizens of former Eagleton.
We're here to support Leslie Knope for preserving our voting rights.
Thank you!
You are all warriors of democracy.
You know, it was the first mayor of Pawnee, in 1817, who said, "All we have is the right to vote and the right to kill Indians without consequence".
And I believe that half of that statement is still true today.
All right!
Second wind!
Andy, I know you're in there.
Andy, come on.
Oh, hey.
I was just-- just here in this dumpster 'cause I jumped in.
Get out!
We need to talk.
About what?
Fresh air, real weapons, an honest kill.
There is no substitute for the real thing.
You want to go back and play that video game, don't you?
Yes!
Damn it!
It is so inspiring to see Eagletonians putting aside their prejudices.
With support like this, Leslie Knope may stand a fighting chance on recall day.
- Permission to hug you.
- Granted.
I should mention, though, that we're not voting to keep Leslie.
What?
We want someone from Eagleton to represent our interests on the new city council.
Sir, I formally revoke our hug.
Well, you can't.
It happened.
We stand on the side of Rosa Parks, and Gandhi, and Team Aniston.
One small vote for Pawnee is one giant leap of voting for mankind.
Hey!
Hey, you're not allowed to receive help from the crowd.
That's strike two.
Hey, man, leave my gong alone.
The reverb is the best part.
If I save your right to vote, you're gonna vote for someone from Eagleton?
Eagleton!
Eagleton!
Hey, Knope!
Wrap it up!
I'm not gonna yield.
I just--I need some time to think.
And because I must keep talking, I'm gonna think out loud.
Okay, if Eagletonians vote for someone else, then it would be in my best interest to stop, right?
So they can't vote.
Uh, da-doy.
Yield.
Or I keep going, because the right to vote is fundamental in any democracy, and this is bigger than me or anyone.
I don't care if I lose.
No one prevents people in my town from voting.
Not on my watch.
The filibuster is on!
Yeah!
Okay.
I can't go back to London.
I'm totally in over my head on this project.
Every day, someone comes up to me and says, "I need your approval on this, Mr. Dwyer".
"I need your signature, Mr. Dwyer".
"That's not a toilet, Mr. Dwyer".
But you said everything was going awesome.
You said you were like Chuck Norris.
I am, but I'm like Chuck Norris now-- some old guy with a beard who used to be good at karate but became a dumb has-been and is scared and confused about his big London job.
Okay.
The parallels between he and I are very eerie.
I'm gonna tell you a secret about everyone else's job.
Okay.
No one knows what they're doing.
I don't know how to run an animal control department.
Half the documents I get I put right into the shredder because they're so boring.
But you seem like you do know what you're doing.
Yeah, I seem like it.
Deep down, everyone is just faking it until they figure it out.
And you will too, because you are awesome and everyone else sucks.
- 30 minutes to go.
- Oh, God, it's so hot.
Almost as hot as the flames that Eagleton would have gone down in if I had not saved them.
Mm, mm, mm.
- That's-- - How I know you would love an ice-cold frozen marg.
All I want is the promise of democracy.
Sure about that?
- I want that marg.
- I know you do.
- I want that Margarita.
- Oh, it's gonna be so good.
So cold.
It's so cold.
- I want to drink it.
- Make that heat go away!
Come on, get!
Come on, girl.
Get!
Give me that Margarita!
No!
I want votes.
Excuse me, worker, bring me a bucket of beers and four hot dogs.
Please, and thank you.
Why are you covered in blood?
Don't worry.
It's not human.
I hope you've made peace with your God, small electronic deer.
Kill it.
Ann, I need that bear.
I got to give Nadia something awesome so she'll remember me when she's in Africa.
Tom, bear or no bear, she clearly likes you.
Actually, how do you even get girls like her-- or me-- to go out with you?
Scientists say the emotions of love and hate are very close to each other.
That's what I tell women.
The point is, she's leaving in two days.
You want her to remember you?
Go spend time with her and do something memorable, dummy!
Thanks, Ann.
I know conversations like this are hard for you 'cause you still have feelings for me, but you'll land on your feet, kid.
- Run or I punch you.
- No punchies!
Okay, bye for real this time.
Wait, wait, wait.
I made you five bologna sandwiches in case you get hungry on the way to the airport.
Did you-- Yes, I used cookies instead of bread.
You think of everything.
I love you.
Love you too.
Are you kidding me?
- Andy!
- Ha!
Ha!
Found it!
I got--I left my wallet in here earlier, I guess.
Whoo!
All good now.
Ooh, look!
Noodles!
No, no, no, babe.
Babe, don't touch those.
I've read the entire charter.
There's no other way to get her a bathroom break unless we bring the bathroom to her-- that's nothing.
I mean, she's not gonna make it.
Look at her, she's dancing around like she's a character in one of those Peanuts cartoons.
Okay, in these last few minutes, I would like to talk about the voting rights act of 1968 while clenching every muscle in my body.
Sound good?
Hey, Knope, how you feeling over there?
You go pee-pee?
Pee-pee times?
Make wee-wee?
Ten more seconds.
Four, three, two, one!
This session is adjourned.
All pending matters are tabled.
Yes!
- You were amazing.
- I love you, but move!
I have to go to the whiz palace.
Oh, wait!
Eagleton!
Eagleton!
Oh!
My beautiful curls!
She didn't have time to hug me, but she could do that?
Hey, Ann, can I talk to you for a second?
About Tom?
Sure.
You guys look like you're having fun.
Yeah, no, I really like him.
I just wanted to say that I think you're really cool, and the fact that Tom dated you makes me think he's a really good guy.
That's so sweet.
Oh, okay.
Wha--what are you-- - What the hell?
- Now!
Sorry, Ann, this is on you.
You told us to make a memory.
- There's your money back.
- Let go!
Suck it!
This is $8!
- Man, that was so much fun.
- Yeah.
Together, we truly did steal a toy from your pregnant friend.
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.
I know we just met, like, two weeks ago and whatever, but is there any chance maybe, when you get back, we can maybe-- Ugh.
Clingy.
Oh, no.
Sorry.
No, no, no, no.
I'm kidding.
Of course I'll call you when I come back.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So long, suckers!
Hey!
Quick!
Ooh!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Now that's what I call shooting.
- Come on!
- That's a new record!
Hey!
Look at that!
You finally made it in the top 10.
Now you can enter your initials.
My initials are private.
Then just put in any three letters.
Ass.
Oh, my God!
That was epic!
I was peeing so freakin' hard, it was like a jacuzzi jet or-- - Hi, Leslie.
- Hey!
Ingrid!
I wasn't talking about the velocity of my pee because you are a very smart and classy lady.
Ben, you remember Ingrid de Forest from the former Eagleton.
Yes, she was just telling me she's been nominated to run against you in the recall.
Wow.
Buzz kill.
I know you must hate me right now, Leslie, and that's justified, but I need to thank you for what you just did in there.
Not the forceful urination.
The filibuster.
Right, yeah.
It was incredibly courageous, and it was selfless.
And if I do win, I'm gonna have very big roller skates to fill.
Could I take you out for a celebratory plate of-- I think you call them waffles?
Wow, that is the best offer you could ever make, but I had to miss my husband's birthday party for this, so I think I'll be spending the evening with him.
- A rain check, maybe.
- Please.
I'm sorry your birthday party got all screwed up.
Maybe I should put those roller skates back on.
Well, you must be exhausted.
We don't have to go to the party.
Oh, we're not going to the party.
We're going home.
Then why would you need to put on rollerskates?
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
We're just-- we're just--skates
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Business at Rent-a-Swag could not be better.
Yesterday Jaden Smith came in, and he was like, "Look, I want to quit the music/acting business and work here with you".
And I was like, "Jaden, be serious.
The world needs you.
You have a gift".
Ever since my client opened his store across the street, your sales have plummeted.
It's only a matter of time before you're out of business.
But my client has had a moment of weakness, something he referred to as "sympathy"?
He's made you a final offer $40,000 for Rent-a-Swag and all of its contents.
I suggest you take it.
Well, I've heard all the facts, and it's pretty obvious what I have to do Get a big old mug of hot chocolate, put on my thinking PJs, and get back to you.
The offer is valid for 48 hours.
We would also be interested in acquiring your thinking PJs.
Listen to me very carefully.
No matter what happens, you will never acquire my thinking PJs or my YouTube blazer Nonnegotiable.
Season 6, Episode 7 "Recall Vote" Sorry.
Sorry.
Larry, everyone else was able to make it to the committee meeting on time.
What's your excuse?
I was voting for you in the recall election.
Lots of people wearing Leslie Knope buttons.
No discussion about the recall election until the polls close at 8:00.
Let's focus on what we can control.
In 24 hours, we are going to transform City Hall into the best haunted house Pawnee has ever seen.
There's been a mistake.
This says that I'm in charge of the silly skeleton room, when really it should say "the undead serial killer room".
- Who do I talk to about changing this?
- It's recall day.
I've made my case, and the latest polls have it as a dead heat, so there's nothing left to do but wait.
I'm fine.
I mean, I got stuff to do.
I'm planning a haunted house.
Plus, um It's Kevin Pollackâs birthday.
That's something to focus on today.
Who cares about the recall?
It's Kevin's day.
I don't know what to do I could take the offer and break even, but I've come so far.
Ron, can you put some more tiny marshmallow in my hot chocky?
Thank you.
If there was something I could do for you, I would.
Maybe you should try taking a walk Out of my office.
- Ron!
You're in Bloosh!
- What?
- Ron's in Bloosh?
- Ron is in Bloosh!
What is Bloosh?
Bloosh is a weekly lifestyle email written by Annabel Porter.
She used to be the face of the Eagleton phone book.
Then she moved to Hollywood to pursue her dream of becoming friends with a bunch of celebrities.
Then she moved back to become a lifestyle guru.
She's legit.
She spent four months living in Kate Bosworth's pool house.
"A Ron Swanson-designed chair is the must-have item of the season," "along with red quinoa, wind therapy, and buying an island".
Annabel says that buying an island is the only real way to know that your goji-berry farm is pesticide-free.
I've been trying to get Rent-a-Swag in Bloosh for months.
And now that you got in, I can get in too.
Congratulations, Ron!
We did it!
- Someone's getting a new leather jacket.
- I don't want a leather jacket.
It's for me.
This is a great day!
Ron's in Bloosh!
- Ron's in Bloosh!
- What?
Ron's in Bloosh!
- Do it.
- Ron's in Bloosh!
April, you seem depressed, and I would know.
I spent most of last year being treated by Dr. Richard Nygard for my own emotional problems.
Yeah, I just miss Andy.
Halloween was, like, kind of our thing.
Every year, we would dress up like demons and egg Larry's house.
- That was you?
- Larry, please.
We're having a private conversation.
Well, I'd like to make Halloween fun for you, like Andy would have, starting right now With scary, scary monster claws!
Okay, people, the grand opening is in 20 hours.
Larry, you had the easiest job Two triangles and a tooth.
Nobody wants Gengurch-family-themed Jack-o-lanterns.
- Gayle likes them.
- Is any of this even good?
Why didn't we call it "City Hall-oween"?
Okay, we need to change every single banner.
Leslie's been holding it together pretty well, but today is when she needs us the most.
That's why we formed the Leslie Knope emotional support task force.
Anything she could possibly need to get her through these final hours, we got it covered Back rubs, YouTube videos of turtles and birds becoming friends A poster announcing the new Lilith Fair concert.
It's fake, but it'll buy us an hour.
We even have a secret hand signal in case we think she needs help.
It's loosely based on the Klingon greeting salute.
I just learned that.
And if I had known, I would not have agreed to it.
Uh, hey, Leslie, how about instead of slightly changing a lot of banners, we paint our toenails to look like pumpkins?
Fun!
Ann, you're a genius!
Your brain is almost as perfect as your face.
Hey, Ron, baby, what are the hot deets on Bloosh?
Start over and speak differently.
Sorry.
Did you call that P.R. guy?
What's the latest news?
Apparently, Joan Callamezzo wants me to go on Pawnee Today to discuss my chairs with this Porter woman.
I said no.
Ron, you said if there was something you could do to help me, you would.
Getting in Bloosh is my last chance to save my store.
You have to go and take me so I can meet her.
- Please?
- Fine.
If it's that important to your company, I'll do it.
Yes!
Now, I know high-end, Internet-only lifestyle magazine really isn't your scene, so Donna and I wrote up some cocktail banter and some conversation snippets for you to practice so you can fit in.
"Annabel, could I be more jels of your low-lights right now"?
"I mean, O.M.Squee, talk about bangs envy".
Oof, you got a long way to go, Swanson.
- Let's go again, from the top.
- I regret everything.
- Babe, you made it.
It's 8:00.
- Thank God.
Okay, everyone, great work, as always.
I'm gonna stay here and just kind of wait for the results to pour in.
Thank you.
I'll see you all tomorrow.
We're not going anywhere.
We're staying with you.
No, really, it's gonna be hours before they call it.
We're not leaving, woman.
Stop trying to get rid of us.
Yeah, I made frappuccinos for a little caffeine boost, and Larry went to get pizzas for everyone.
Aw, that's very sweet, you guys.
Thank you.
All right, let's hunker down.
It's gonna be a long night.
Too close to call, a real nail-biter, anybody's game These are three phrases you won't hear tonight, as Leslie Knope has been voted out of office.
What was expected to be a close race What did he say?
Has actually been a not close race.
Pawnee voters have decisively removed Leslie Knope - Honey, I'm so sorry.
- From the City Council.
I got-a the pizza pizza time, it's-a pizza time!
Larry, everyone is miserable, and you are only making it worse.
- Okay, Leslie's on her way in.
- Is she okay?
I left her, like, and her outgoing message is just her sobbing and burping and crazy laughing.
Yeah, you know what?
She's actually handling it pretty well.
What's up, fartwads?
Are you eating a paunch burger?
Well, you know what?
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
I mean, I've been boycotting them ever since Pinewood and her goons started this whole recall business, but who cares now, right?
What does it matter?
Nothing matters anymore.
Mmm.
Oh, my God.
This is good.
This is really good.
Why did I ever fight this?
Have you thought about a concession speech?
Oh, concession speech?
Yeah, I wrote one.
"Eat my shorts, Jabronies.
Knope, out".
I thought it best to revisit the concession speech at a later time.
But we should focus on the haunted house.
And you know what I think it needs, actually, is a papier-mÃ¢chÃ© Li'l Sebastian!
- What?
- Oh!
I'm gonna go fall asleep on a bench.
I can honestly say today's guest is the only person in this town who's a bigger deal than I am.
Please welcome lifestyle guru Annabel Porter.
Hello, hello.
It's me.
I'm here.
- Yes, you are.
- Hi.
Can I just say, as a journalist, I feel like we're best friends.
Tell the audience about yourself.
Well, I'm just a simple former phonebook model who found her calling.
- You know, I'm not perfect.
- Oh.
The average woman worries about what she looks like in a bathing suit.
So does my nanny.
So I get it.
Annabel, what trends are Pardon the pun, but Trending?
First of all, Mozambique cashmere is the new cast-iron stove.
Of course.
I have found some amazing new conflict-free paella recipes, and, luckily, my favorite fishmonger now makes house calls.
- Thank God.
- Finally.
But my fave new item is a deliciously bold chair - Ooh.
- By local artist Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson is here.
He will be joining us after the break, so stick around.
Did that woman call my chair "delicious"?
Whoo, Happy Halloween.
Oh, caterpillar!
Thank you.
Hey, guys, come on in.
- Welcome to the den of horrors.
- Where's all the scary stuff?
Scary stuff is invisible, Leah Broken dreams, disappointment, achieving your greatest goal and having it all fall apart and knowing that you'll never climb any higher.
Can we have some candy?
I'm gonna give you something sweeter than candy, Ryan The truth.
It's very possible that some of you have already peaked.
It's all downhill from here, turkeys.
Okay, let's say good-bye to Ms. Knope, kids.
It is Ms. Knope.
It's not city councilwoman Knope, because that chapter of my life is already over.
Just remember, kids, nothing gold can stay.
Okay.
Oh, my goodness, we are back with America's greatest leader Annabel Porter and her new favorite artisan, local woodworker Ron Swanson.
Hello.
I discovered Ron's chairs a few months ago, and what I absolutely love about a Swanson is you can really use it for anything.
Yes, mostly you use it for sitting.
Make it a rustic accent piece in your solarium.
Even better, use it as a focal point in your yoga tent.
Put it by a table and eat a meal.
We don't do meals in my home.
No, every two hours, we eat what I like to call a food tease, like an oat wedge or a seaweed lozenge.
Can I just say And I think this is really important, so I need everyone to shut up - I love your hair.
- Oh.
Thank you.
It's genetic and unattainable.
I am scaring you!
I could see you.
There's, like, a million mirrors in front of me.
And you're never gonna make me not miss Andy, okay?
What about this?
I'm Bert Macklin, friendly lifeguard.
Bert Macklin is not a lifeguard.
He's an FBI agent.
- Really?
That's even harder to believe.
- Just stop, okay?
Your lame attempts at trying to cheer me up are not working.
Now I'm sad that I miss Andy and sad that I can't make fun of you to Andy.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
I've failed you, both as a scary monster and a friend.
Hey, I am really sorry.
I know you must feel awful.
I don't feel awful.
You know, actually, I feel like I can finally relax.
Accepting that you've peaked is very freeing.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
I was impeached when I was 18, and it was brutal.
But you just have to keep climbing back up that hill.
Or do you?
Maybe instead of working super hard to rebuild your life, you just said, "I peaked.
Wow.
What a great run".
"And now I'm going to spend the rest of my life really chill".
Well, sure, I mean, part of that sounds very appealing.
- Yeah.
- But, n-no.
Uh, see, i-it was important for me See, I took a job in City budget crisis management, and now I work for a candy charity.
Oh, God, did I peak when I was 18?
- There it is.
- Drink up.
- Whoo!
- Shots!
B-13 shots.
Bird bath salts.
Wha?
Champagne decanters!
This is heaven.
I love your chair.
I need 12 for my stepdaughter's craft room.
Well, I make two a year, so maybe in six years.
- Can you put me on the wait list?
- Me too Unless your chair was ever touched by someone who ate refined sugar.
Then I can't buy any of your chairs, and I protest this entire event.
Okay, Ron, Annabelâs coming over.
When you talk me up, be sure to mention that you really admire how I take big risks with men's neck accessories.
- There he is.
- Hello, hello.
Thank you for your kind words about my chairs, Miss Porter.
No, thank us.
You are about to make a ton of money.
I want to license your designs.
We are going to put Swanson chairs in every six-bedroom home in the Midwest.
If my chairs were mass-produced, they wouldn't be Swanson chairs.
Swanson chairs are handmade.
Yes, and now they will be made by thousands of tiny Chinese hands.
Oh, Miss Porter, this is my very good friend Tom Haverford.
He's a big fan of your Whatever you call what you do.
Please speak to each other while I leave.
Oh, no, I am not done with you, you wicked little so-and-so.
Terrific.
You know what?
I had my time, you know?
I did my thing.
I wanted to be a city councilor, and I did, and I was, and I was like, whoo!
And the people were like, pffft!
- At least we have each other.
- I love you so much.
I love you too.
- This is real.
- I know.
- You're my husband.
- You're my wife.
- You married me in front of people.
- I did.
I was there.
We may have peaked, but it doesn't matter.
We need to do something big, you know, something that really lets people know that we're gonna love each other forever.
- Yeah!
What is it?
- I got it.
Hello, sir.
We are sober.
We would like to get tattoos on our bodies, 'cause we love each other.
Tattoos?
This is a pawnshop.
- But, yeah, sure, I can do that.
- Awww!
Yes!
It happened!
Look what he's doing.
He's breaking pens.
- This is the idea of the century.
- Right here.
Come here.
My store is called Rent-a-Swag.
It's a clothing rental service for teens.
It's an interesting idea.
Are you guys doing well?
- We're doing amazing.
- Mm.
And it'd be perfect for Bloosh.
Why don't you take out whatever you wrote about my chairs and put something in about Rent-a-Swag instead?
This month's trends are final.
I can't just throw a trend out.
But my Bloosh scouts have started trend-tracking for the February zine blast.
- Good God, these words.
- I'll have them stop by your store.
That'll be too late.
We'll be out of business by then.
I thought you said you were doing well.
Ronnie, one last time, have you reconsidered mass production?
I can sell your chairs on my site.
No, thank you, ma'am.
I'm not interested in letting someone else sell my work.
Well, that's too bad.
This party is over.
It no longer is.
It was.
- It was?
That was my last shot.
- Sorry, Tommy.
Let's just grab some of that lychee body oil and bounce.
Can you grab me some of those pomegranate face masks too?
Fo' sho'.
Can I ask you a question?
Are we the cutest couple you've ever seen?
Nope.
Okay, you want the long needle or the short needle?
Doesn't matter.
Can't find a short needle.
Long needle it is.
I have a big idea.
I want a portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, tastefully done, and then she has a very classy tattoo of Pat Benatar on her arm.
And that's very subtle.
No, scratch that.
Scratch all that.
Just write "Ben".
Do you have anything to numb the pain?
Sure, take a scoop out of the pill bucket.
Okay, you said you wanted "mouth queen"?
No, stop.
Stop it.
Stop everything that you're doing.
- Stop it.
- Ann's here!
Ann wants a tattoo!
- Ann!
- No, no!
- Ann!
- No!
Shh!
Ann does not want a tattoo.
No one wants a tattoo.
Ann, relax.
Be "respitable" for a second, okay?
What we are doing is not nuts.
We are merely getting tattoos so that everybody knows we love each other and that we haven't peaked.
- It makes a lot of sense.
- Okay, we're leaving, all right?
So say good-bye to the nice man and thank me for saving you from being on Dateline.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
- Good-bye, world traveler.
- Later, bro Heisen.
- Go.
- Come on.
I don't want to be a failure again, Ron.
There's no shame in failure if you gave it an honest effort.
Easy for you to say.
People are dying to give you money for your business, and you didn't even take it.
I didn't sell my chairs to that website because I value my name.
The only thing that's important at the end of the day is what's on your gravestone Your name.
My gravestone's gonna be a 60-inch touchscreen with a hologram of four mes singing End of the Road by Boyz II Men But point taken.
Ben, what is the first rule of the Leslie Knope emotional support task force?
Don't let her get a tattoo.
- What the hell happened?
- I couldn't help it.
She's so cute when she's coming up with destructive ideas.
Never send a husband to do a best friend's job.
Out, Wyatt.
Walk it off.
- Walk it off.
- Fine.
- You did it.
- Yep.
- See you later, Ann.
- No, Knope, sit down.
- You are avoiding your problems.
- What?
No, I'm not.
- Can we talk about this tomorrow?
- You were down in the polls.
Your opponents were well funded and well organized.
You must have known this would be a possibility.
Intellectually, I knew that I might be in trouble, but deep in my heart, I never really thought Ben and I tried to help you, but as usual, you're the best person for the job.
You need to hear yourself read this.
"They held the recall election, and I lost".
"I was voted out of office".
"In 30 days, I will no longer be a Pawnee city councilor".
Oh, it's so hard to read when you're drunk.
Keep going.
"But I am Leslie Knope".
"I am more than a city councilor".
"I am an unstoppable force of energy".
"And I will use those days to work as hard as I can".
These are all your ongoing projects, everything you're currently working on for Pawnee.
You have things to do.
You have a month left.
Use it.
Ann, you poetic and noble land mermaid, you're right once again.
Thank you.
I flushed my car keys down the toilet.
No problem.
Eww stop.
Hello to you too, April.
I'm sorry I said you were lame, okay?
You are, but I know you were just trying to help me, so Thank you, April.
Happy Halloween.
And if you want to egg Larry's house, come find me.
You guys are cute.
- Where'd that come from?
- I'm weak.
I miss Andy, and it's making me weak.
Also, if Chris puts that much effort into making my stupid night better, I'm sure that he'll make your lame life perfect.
Or he's secretly super in love with me.
It's probably that.
That's a funny joke, April.
But the truth is, I'm very much in love with Ann.
Okay, gross.
The spell's broken.
I've made my decision, and I'll sell you Rent-a-Swag, but on my terms.
Which are?
$40,000 for the inventory, the website, and everything else in the store, but I keep the name Rent-a-Swag.
It's mine, and I'm keeping it.
The name is actually an important part of the sale.
- Really?
- Yes.
My client likes the name.
It's better than Tommy's Closet.
He needs the name.
Well, I don't know what to tell you, except I'll throw in the name in exchange for $20,000 more and 5% of your client's business.
I'll run it past my client, but I think we have a deal.
Ron said there's nothing more valuable than my name, but he's not a businessman.
I am.
And now I have seed money for my next venture.
I sold out, baby.
The votes have been counted, and I have been recalled.
I am, of course, disappointed.
But I am still your City councilwoman for 30 more days, and I intend to spend every second I have left working for you and this great city.
The thing about being part of the Leslie Knope emotional support task force is that it's a very easy job.
She's never down for that long.
And now that she's had a little time to recharge, she is like a toddler bouncing back from a nap.
Hey!
There you guys are.
Okay, Ben, I need some help with the re-zoning thing.
Also, I think we should paint our deck, so I have some color samples for you.
And to thank you both for being there when I needed you, I carved your faces into these Jack-o-lanterns.
Ann, it was very hard to capture your beauty, and, Ben, you make a sexy pumpkin No surprise.
Love you both.
See you later.
- Okay.
- Wow.
This is amazing.
Not bad.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
We're gonna have some fun tonight, Pawnee!
Who is ready to play 60?
Everybody on the field!
Yeah!
The NFL has a campaign to try to get kids active for 60 minutes per day.
And so we bused in a hundred lucky, little buggers from Pawnee.
And they are gonna get a chance to play with the Colts.
Oh!
Come on, Reggie!
I told you to run a button hook.
- I did, Leslie.
- Okay.
I guess you would know.
A pleasure to see you again, Mr. Luck.
We met briefly last year - at our friend's bachelor party.
- Oh, yeah.
Right.
How are you?
I normally don't answer that question, but since I respect your talent, I will tell you-- I am fine.
Hi, I'm April.
I stole your wallet.
You guys are weird.
Thank you.
What's up, girl?
Keep walking, 98.
You don't even want to talk to that guy?
- He plays for the NFL.
- He's a linebacker.
Skill positions only for Donna Meagle.
I got my Colts beanie, my Colts scarf, I got the Colts grill going, and the crowning glory-- Colts slippies.
How are you going to run in those?
"Run"?
Tommy doesn't run.
That's your guys' job.
Now, uh, let's go fetch this football throw, fellas.
I love sports.
Check it out, Tom-- the Eagleton reservoir.
Isn't it stunning?
It's just a big dumb pond.
This morning I saw a YouTube clip of a little puppy riding a motorcycle.
So my bar for "stunning" is pretty high.
What if I told you that this water has fluoride in it?
Then I would tell you the puppy had a little side car with a piggy in it named Hampton.
First of all, send me a link to that video.
But more importantly, now that we have access to the Eagleton reservoir and the water-treatment supply, Pawnee is going to have fluoride in its water for the first time in our history, our oral history.
Nailed it.
Of course I'm upset that I lost the recall election.
But I'm just gonna spend the remainder of my term cramming in as many good projects as I can.
Lame duck?
Try flame duck 'cause this duck is on fire.
It's hard doing stupid government stuff now that Rent-a-Swag's closed.
I'm a businessman.
That's what I was born to do.
Well, look, you just got to make the most of the job that you have.
Like, take that trash collector.
It's not the most glamorous job in the world, but he's doing it with a smile on his face.
Oh, my God.
He's not wearing any pants.
What's wrong with him?
- Let's get out of here.
- He's smiling at us!
Let's go!
Run!
What's so exciting, everyone?
Look what Ron made.
It's amazing.
Several months ago, I was on a walk and found my crib tree.
I approached the tree, murdered it, left it to cure in my woodshop, and have begun working it into a crib for my upcoming child.
Ron Swanson, you cannot use this crib.
You're ignoring every known crib-safety standard.
It's all covered in the parenting book I'm reading.
Are you going to crawl my way?
By Lenny Kravitz.
My crib will be safe because I'm building it with my own two hands.
I bought my crib in Bloomington, and I am confident that it is literally the safest crib in the explored universe.
Let me take you there, and you can talk to the salesperson.
Counteroffer-- you take me nowhere, and I talk to no one.
Counter-counteroffer-- you come with me, or I make you attend a four-hour fax cover-sheet protocol meeting.
Either way, it's a win for me.
Next on the docket is a vote to approve the Pawnee-Eagleton reservoir merger.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're just goosing our water supply with fluoride?
I mean, come on.
Are we really gonna force every Pawnee resident to ingest a chemical we know nothing about?
Fluoride is used by the communists to control our minds.
No, it's not.
Fluoride can control minds?
Like, you can use it to make ladies do stuff?
How am I the one that is getting booted off of this city council?
Okay, fluoride is safe, it is good for you, and almost every town in America uses it.
Ah, all right.
You got me.
I don't want fluoride in the water because I'm a dentist, and I like cavities.
Yeah, that is not a valid reason.
Pawnee's cavity problem is why a small-town dentist, like me, can afford such a boss ride.
Got an Asian girl to sit in it once.
Why did we come out here?
Come on, Jamm.
Fluoride in the water-- it's a no-brainer.
Can't you just let me have this one?
No can do, Knopey.
As a matter of fact, I would like to propose my own bill-- the Pawnee Clean Water Bill, which prohibits adding anything to our water supply forever.
Jamm's not going to be able to kill this reservoir merger, is he?
On my side, I have facts, science, and reason.
All he has is fear-mongering.
Oh, my God, he's gonna win.
Yeah, people get jittery about stuff like this.
Remember last year when no one would get flu shots 'cause there was a rumor they turned you European?
Well, I'll figure something out.
Oh, Jessica's here.
I better go.
- Okay, bye.
- Hey, sugar butt.
Some lardos in Muncie ate tainted Sweetums toffee sticks and diarrhea'd so much, they ended up in the hospital.
Ugh.
Can we give their school, like, a new seesaw or something?
Yeah.
Thanks.
The new site looks good.
Nice work.
Oh, my God.
These dogs are so cute.
I want to throw up and kill myself.
Animal control had to take in all the pets from Eagleton.
And Crazy Craig used to run all their shelters, so he helped me make an adoption website for all the dogs.
If you can look at that site and not want to take home you're basically a war criminal.
See the way that dog is rolling around in a puddle?
That's something Andy does when he gets hot.
Oh, my God, you're right.
That is so Andy.
Oh, my God.
That dog is totally Tom!
I don't know why.
It doesn't look like him.
But it just is.
It's like the dog is the essence of Tom.
Okay, important meeting in the conference room right now.
We are going to all pick our spirit dogs.
Oh, I've got to pick up Gayle at the airport.
Larry, I swear to God, if you leave right now, we will make your spirit dog a miniature schnauzer.
- Is that bad?
- Yes!
Get in there!
Ann found this place.
It's where we bought our "Sounds of Nature" machine.
You bought a machine that replicates an open window?
Frasier!
Chris Traeger.
Do you remember me?
I came in here looking for the Vanna White book on child care-- I'd like to solve the puzzle of parenting.
Could you show my friend, Ron, that amazing crib that you sold me?
The Babylove L'il Sweetheart Safe 4 Ever and Ever model.
Oh, yeah, that thing is a deathtrap.
- I'm sorry?
- Just found out this morning-- it's being recalled.
They found maxicylofentabol in the glue.
Is that good?
It sounds bad.
It burned off my fingernails.
I'll be in the car.
Councilwoman Leslie Knope wants to put fluoride, which is a chemical, into your drinking water.
You know what else is a chemical?
Strychnine and cyanide.
- What?
- And dirt and rust and even broken glass.
Exactly.
You definitely understand what chemicals are, Perd.
I would suggest if you want to contact the psychopath that wants to turn your kids into bad-at-math, communist fluoride zombies, well, just call the number at the bottom of your screen.
Leslie Knope.
Stop right there.
You know what?
Fluoride protects your teeth, and it's perfectly healthy for you.
Well, if Jamm says that, then he is a lying idiot, and if you believe it, then so are you.
Whoa.
You just talked to that person like I talk to you.
- You can't do that.
- Why not?
What are they gonna do, kick me out of office?
Why did it take me so long to realize this?
There are no consequences to my actions anymore.
No matter what I do, literally nothing bad can happen to me.
I'm like a white, male U.S. senator.
Fluoride is going into the water, moron.
Oh.
Hey, mom.
Sorry.
Because all it does is prevent cavities!
God!
I expected more from you.
Right.
I'm a loose cannon.
We need to fight fire with fire.
I call a town hall meeting, I gather everyone together, I distribute the binders, but now the binders are bright yellow!
Om!
- Too extreme?
- Too nothing.
Look, Jamm's already ruined fluoride.
Everyone's scared of it.
What if we just called it something else?
What do you mean?
I mean we rebrand.
No one cared about Calvin Broadus until he started calling himself Snoop Doggy Dogg.
Then when people got tired of that, he went by Snoop Dogg, and now he's Snoop Lion.
What's he gonna be in ten years--Snoop Laser Snake?
Who knows?
What are you saying-- we need to sex up fluoride?
I don't know, Tom.
It's a pretty sexy topic already.
Leslie, you got to give people something to get excited about.
You told me to make the most of my job.
I'm good at this stuff.
Now, are you a loose cannon or not?
Yeah.
I'm as loose as a goose.
Do your thing, Tom.
Aw.
Now, remember, it's about finding a dog that captures your spirit.
See?
This is Craig.
Oh, no!
That is insane!
I will burn this place to the ground if you pick that one!
Okay, good choice.
You guys, Leslie.
Yes!
And Ron Swanson.
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.
- This is Larry.
- That's great.
Bingo.
Donna.
Nailed it.
Ooh.
Because you're pretty and you like makeup and stuff.
Game over.
Ron, I want to do things the Swanson way.
Wonderful.
First rule-- no conversation lasts longer than 100 total words.
You have used 9.
I have used 20.
- Continue.
- Fun.
I'd like you to teach me to build a crib.
Why do you need to build your own crib?
Because I no longer trust anything other than my own two hands.
It is debilitating, but exciting.
Okay, we'll go to my woodshop at lunch.
Wonderful.
Look at us-- both standing on the cusp of fatherhood.
I know we haven't spent a lot of time together, - but-- - 100.
All right, so, in conclusion fluoride, chemical, tiny genitals, misinformation, panic, death, Jenny McCarthy.
Well, I don't know, councilman.
That was a little dry.
What do you say we have some fun, huh?
Check this.
Plain water?
Yuck.
I'm bored.
Then try this.
What the-- what just happened?
That water contains teeth dazzler, which makes your teeth stronger and starts a party in your mouth.
What?
Fluoride's boring, guys.
Boo!
Welcome to T-dazzle.
It's not a chemical.
It's an aquatic-based social-media oral experience.
Everyone who tweets at T-dazzle in the next hour will be entered to win an exciting plain blue T-shirt.
I say "T," you say "dazzle".
- "T".
- Dazzle.
- "T".
- Dazzle.
- "T".
- Dazzle.
Thank you for the woodworking lesson, Ron.
This whole crib-recall thing has got me literally rethinking everything I thought I knew about parenting.
What sleep method will you be using-- Ferber, Sears?
Swanson method, where you close your eyes and fall asleep.
I really wish Ron would engage, but he exudes so much wisdom that I can learn parenting tips simply by being in his presence.
Someone like Ron is teaching even when they're not teaching.
Does that make sense?
My anxiety has kept me up for over 50 hours.
Our polling shows that 72% of citizens are in favor of adding T-dazzle to their water, effectively killing Councilman Jamm's so-called Clean Water Bill.
Eat it, Jamm.
I won.
Apology accepted.
You know, I've actually come around to your way of thinking on this.
My only thought is, why stop here?
Ladies and gentlemen, Sweetums president Jessica Wicks.
Whoo!
Look, we all love T-dazzle.
But we can do more to improve our drinking supply.
Sweetums is excited to propose an alternative to boring municipal water.
We call it "Drink-ems"!
Whoo!
Sweetums is prepared to take over the management of Pawnee's water.
This is gonna save this town beaucoup bucks.
Take a sip of this delicious water and imagine it coming out of your faucets at home.
This water is filled with sugar.
There's absolutely no way we are doing this.
Checkmate.
Did you bring those with you just to do that?
- Maybe.
- Damn.
It is a baller move.
What are we gonna do now, Leslie?
Hey.
Okay, are you still mad at me about the poodle thing?
It was just a dumb game.
I can pick another dog.
I'm not mad about the choice.
I'm mad about your reasons.
"Pretty," "makeup"-- is that all you know about me?
We don't hang out that much.
It's not like you know a ton about me.
You're beautiful, yet cold and aloof.
You pride yourself on being a loner.
You do not obey, you choose to cooperate.
And when you stop baring your fangs to pick a mate, it's for life.
And you're fiercely loyal to your pack, which makes you a rare black Siberian husky.
That was so spot-on, it was scary.
I need to go lie down for 45 minutes.
No, an hour a full hour.
Good morning.
This won't take long.
Simply put, it would be madness to let Sweetums take over our water supply and pump it full of sugar.
What's next-- cookie dough toothpaste?
Bad example.
That would be amazing.
My point is, Sweetums is an evil, profit-hungry corporation that is ruining our health.
Ever since Sweetums opened its doors, obesity is up 100%.
It's unacceptable.
Down with that poison-peddling corporate monster.
Down with Sweetums!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Heard about your speech.
Sounded great.
I wish you could've seen it.
It felt so good.
I love loose cannon-ing.
You know, I love the power of no consequences.
Well, unfortunately, there has been one consequence.
I just got fired from Sweetums.
Because you were embezzling I hope.
Hey, Jessica!
Did you do something to your hair?
Because, sister, you look good enough to eat.
Num num num num num.
What do you want, Leslie?
You can't punish Ben for something I did.
It's not fair.
I love him, and I will do anything to help him get his job back.
What do you want?
I want you to formally apologize for what you said about Sweetums.
I want you to say that we're a moral, upstanding corporation that you're proud to have in Pawnee.
And when you make your apology, I want you to wear a lime-green pantsuit because it will look horrible on you.
You are such an autumn.
Did you need me for something?
Yes, I want to figure out your spirit dog, and I'm going to do that by learning everything there is to know about you.
All right.
Game on.
Okay, what's your favorite color?
For cars, it's gold.
For shoes, it's red-- unless it's the weekend, then reverse them.
- Favorite music?
- 1970s funk and 1770s opera and Sugar Ray, post Mark McGrath after he left for Entertainment Tonight.
- Favorite book?
- Downton Abbey.
- That's not a-- - DowntonAbbey.
Okay.
Um, describe your perfect Sunday.
Church, do the Harper's Magazine Acrostic, play my oboe in the jacuzzi while the sun sets over puget sound.
Favorite movies?
In order-- Natural Born Killers, Remains of the Day, and Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.
Excellent.
Thank you very much for your time.
I will have your answer shortly.
No idea.
If a joint is properly fashioned, all you need to do is guide it into place.
"All you need to do is guide it into place".
What I get from that is, when parenting, sometimes a subtle hand is more effective than a strong one.
This is already so much more helpful than the last book on parenting I read-- Rad Dads by Apolo Anton Ohno and Shaun White.
Nah.
Ron, why did you throw that wood away?
It's unstable.
It's no good.
I just don't understand "the throwing away the wood" metaphor.
What's the lesson?
Oh, I know!
It's potty-training.
That trash can is the toilet, and the wood was the feces.
Chris, I'm not teaching you anything.
We're just building a crib.
No, I know you're not consciously teaching me anything.
I'm trying to siphon off some of your calm, centered wisdom through metaphors.
Metaphors?
I hate metaphors.
That's why my favorite book is Moby Dick-- no froufrou symbolism, just a good, simple tale about a man who hates an animal.
That's enough for today, I think.
- An organized child is a-- - No.
Okay, I've been working on this for three hours, and I know your spirit dog.
You are a Nova Scotia toller, because you're outgoing and adventurous.
And you love Canada?
- No, that's not right.
- No, it isn't.
But I appreciate the effort.
We're good.
And don't beat yourself up.
You'll probably never guess what kind of dog I am.
You're right.
I'll never guess what kind of dog you are, because you're not a dog.
You're a cat.
You're temperamental.
You're unpredictable, complex, and hard to read.
You make people work before you let them in.
But if they put the time in and prove that they care, then you open yourself up to them.
Right?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Hmm.
"So let's all raise a glass, "full of delicious, sugary drinking water, to Sweetums-- a Pawnee Institution".
Leslie, don't do this.
I have to, Ben.
We can't both be out of a job.
What will we do-- sleep all day, take cooking classes together, sit on a couch and watch movies?
- God, that sounds horrible.
- There's more at stake here.
I mean, you apologize, it'll be an endorsement - for the Drink-ems plan.
- I know that, but-- And everything you said about Sweetums was right on.
I mean, 90% of the charity work I did was to compensate for messes they caused.
And I don't want to work for them anymore.
Are you sure?
Yeah, just go up there, stick to your guns.
It's not gonna make a difference.
I can't beat them.
All I have on my side is facts and science, and people hate facts and science.
Wait.
I have an idea.
Go get Tom.
Run!
Get Tom!
Yesterday I said some pretty harsh things about Sweetums and their great new product.
But when I looked at the research, I found some pretty compelling facts about Drink-ems that made me change my tune.
Each Drink-ems is packed with 35% of your daily monopotassium phosphate requirement.
MPP is an emulsifier as well as a plus-7 PH buffer.
Now, I know what you're thinking-- what about its molar mass?
How does 136.086 grab you?
What the-- I don't know about y'all, but Drink-ems seems pretty boring to me, not like H-2-flow.
Excuse me.
I have several binders with very important data that I need to get through.
Well, miss, I think we'd all appreciate it if you just swallowed a teaspoon of hush.
Think of H-2-flow as an app for your teeth.
The more flow you take in, the more sparkle points you get.
Get enough sparkle points, and you're on your way to your first aqua badge!
Collect enough aqua badges, and we'll welcome you to the H-2-flow Platinum Club.
I'm great at business, and I'm great at parks stuff.
I'm like Picasso meets Michael Jordan.
I can paint, but, uh, I can also be a world-class gambler.
Ron, what's this?
The crib I built.
I'm giving it to you and Ann.
It's perfectly safe.
I tested it by hitting it with my truck.
Well, Ron, I can't accept.
This is for your baby.
There's more than one crib tree in a forest.
That's not a lesson, by the way, just a comment on lumber availability.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
Nobody has all the right answers in parenting, including me.
And that toxic crib you bought won't be the last mistake you make.
But a man who's this worried about making all the right choices cares very much.
That's all that matters.
You'll be a great father.
Thank you, Ron for the crib and the advice.
It's much better than any metaphor.
Does the white whale actually symbolize the unknowability and meaninglessness of human existence?
No.
It's just a  fish.
Hey, good news.
Drink-ems is dead.
As of tomorrow, every Pawnee resident will have H-2-flow in their drinking water.
That's great news.
H-2-flow is fluoride, right?
I think so.
I'll double-check with Tom, but I'm, like, 95% sure.
Wow.
Look at us.
Two people, who are about to have zero jobs.
Weird, huh?
And you and I-- we always land on our feet, right?
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh!
Guess who won that plain blue T-shirt?
No way!
Look how blue it is.
Wow.
Things are already looking up.
Yeah!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
- Are you ready?
- Yes!
No, babe.
Are you ready?
Yes?
I got fired from running the Sweetums Foundation.
Thanks to me.
Sorry, again.
Hey, blessing in disguise.
I took a job at this accounting firm, they've tried to hire me three times, I finally gave in.
But I've had a week off in between jobs, and I've been cooking up something pretty big.
The last time he was in between jobs, he got deep into claymation, so this should be different, hopefully.
Presenting "The Cones of Dunshire," a brand-new gaming experience.
Two wizards, a Maverick, the arbiter, two warriors, a corporal, and a ledgerman.
Now, the ledgerman just keeps score, and he wears this hat.
Oh, boy.
Now, the object is to accumulate cones.
Four cones wins, but in order to get a cone, you have to build a civilization.
The other amazing thing is the challenge play.
Actually, let me tell you more about the trivia cards, 'cause you're gonna need to know about roadblocks first.
Nah, never mind.
The thing about the challenge play is that it's basically the gamein reverse.
Then you roll three dice to see how many dice you roll with.
Oh, 16.
Perfect, lots of choices.
Okay, each turn goes: Roll, buy, action.
I mean, obviously, this would be much taller in the real game.
But the corporal can veto.
This should be green too.
How did this happen?
Are the cones a metaphor?
Well, yes and no.
- What is this called again?
- "The Cones of Dunshire".
Oh, my God, the Maverick should be able to trade lumber for agriculture credits.
How have I not thought of this before?
This is nothing, right?
When do you go back to work again?
Tomorrow.
It's fine.
I'll just throw this in the garbage.
As soon as Knope is gone, these are going up all over Chambers.
Jamm for three!
Ha ha!
What, are you trying to build a house with those bricks?
Ooh!
The girl is attacking me.
Any new business before we adjourn?
Yes, I have one-- the Pawnee Commons.
Oh, boy.
The money for the Pawnee Commons, aka the greatest future park in the world, aka my personal dream project Aka Is currently in a discretionary fund.
I'd like to move it to a lockbox, to ensure that it is used for that project.
The thing is, Leslie, this kind of decision is-- it's not really up to you anymore.
Because the voters, to use a technical political term, gave you the stanky boot.
But we'll keep your money safe, baby girl.
What, you think I'm gonna use it to put a new limestone shower in my office?
Yeah, now I do.
I propose that we table this discussion until, let's say, the second Knope is gone.
Later, bunheads.
Glass!
Video Ron demand.
What you carrying, my dude?
The time has come to sell my cabin.
But I haven't had much luck finding a buyer.
"For sale.
Small house.
Location: Forest".
It's a little wordy, don't you think?
"Current owner will not clean up shotgun shells or animal carcasses".
The hell is wrong with you, Swanson?
Fine, I'll clean up the shotgun shells, but the carcasses remain to fertilize my berry patch.
If you really want to unload that little horror cabin, you gonna need a professional to stage it properly.
Lucky for you, I recently got my real estate license.
Spladow!
Check it.
"Regal Meagle Realty".
"Find your castle".
Fine, I suppose I could use some help.
Yo, Donna, let me get a little skin in the game, maybe split that commission?
All right.
Show me what you got.
I'll split that commish.
Split that commish The question I always ask myself is, what kind of mogul should I be?
Fashion mogul, energy drink mogul.
I even thought about downhill skiing.
A mogul mogul.
But a real estate mogul?
Hmm.
That's a hot mogul right now.
Ben Wyatt, reporting for duty.
How you doing, Barney?
Good to see you again.
I just can't believe it's finally happening.
Dad!
He's here!
He really came!
Hello, Ben.
I'm Frank.
I took the job when you passed it up last time.
Heard a lot about you.
Well, all good things, I hope.
A little too good.
Let's see if you live up to the hype.
I'm not joking.
Oh.
Frank seems cool.
Well, tell everybody in Michigan I said hi, and tell your mom that I love the banana cake she posted on Pinterest.
Oh, the father of your child is here.
I have to go.
I'll talk to you soon.
- I love you.
- Was that Ann?
I hope you were speaking to her in a calming voice 'cause babies can hear everything.
Baby, if you can still hear me, I love you.
- The phone is hung up.
- Oh.
You got my message about Jamm being a dinkhead?
Yes, but as city manager, I can't play sides.
And I think all of our heads can be a little dinky at times.
Fine, but his is the dinkiest.
And I would know because I'm keeping score.
Ever since I started city council, I have gone head-to-head with Jamm 112 times.
He has won 56 times, I have won 56 times.
I will not lose our last battle.
Will you help me?
No.
Oh.
The way you stood up like that, I thought it was gonna go a different way.
No, I can't help directly, but I am on your side.
And I will assist you in any way that I can.
Maybe I can mediate, like Dr. Phil, only qualified.
So what's the story, Ron?
Diane making you sell this place?
Not at all.
Recently, I purchased a new cabin big enough for the whole family.
I just can't justify owning four cabins.
Two cabins.
The new cabin I bought has a great tire swing for the girls, access to a lake for all the kids to play in.
Plus, it doesn't have these razor-sharp perimeter defense planks sticking out of the ground.
I usually get a 5% commission, but I'll do it for 3%.
Friends and family discount.
Make it 5%.
I don't want you getting any ideas about us being friends.
- Respect.
- Donna, baby.
For the fireplace, I'm thinking fake antlers.
But what kind of scarves do we want to hang off the fake antlers?
- Oh, duh.
Crocheted.
- Most def.
That'll look legit next to those antique "Visit France" posters.
Mm.
Ron, you want to stay outside and do nothing while they make your cabin look like garbage?
I'd like that very much.
We can watch the shadows get longer.
Okay.
Wow, you guys sure take the start-up paperwork seriously around here.
Sorry to start you out like this, and on a Friday no less.
But it's our toughest case.
Three competing family trusts, a contested will-- it's a real puzzler!
So let's see what you got, genius.
If I'm murdered tonight, start the investigation with those two guys.
The hell you nerds doing here?
We're not done talking about the lockbox.
This isn't over.
And I am here to mediate.
You can't just show up at my door like this.
Look, I know we have had our differences, but this is very important to me.
And I'm not leaving until we hash this out.
I respect the moxie, Knope.
You can come in for a minute.
Shoes off.
This is a house of respect.
Well, I don't need to do that.
My feet are very clean.
No shoes, you lose.
"No shoes, you lose"?
That means we should have shoes then, right?
No shoes Hmm.
Yeah, so this is my weekend dojo.
Sorry, the place is a bit of a mess.
My wife's in Oklahoma for eight months.
Maybe forever.
We'll see if she forgives me.
- Who's that, Michelle Wie?
- It's not sexual.
I'm just a really big fan of her game.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Because in that picture, she's wearing a bikini.
Yeah, thanks.
Photoshopped it myself.
Fantastic.
Well, this is about the time I hit the hay, so Why don't we all hit the hay?
We'll stay here, get a good night's sleep, and we can start negotiations tomorrow.
We stopped at the outlet mall on the way here.
Got ourselves a sleeping bag, a giant tin of caramel corn, and an irregular skirt from DKNY.
The hem is crooked, but it was 8 bucks.
The point is, I am not leaving until I get that lockbox.
Oh, playing hardball, huh?
Hey, no sweat off my sack.
You can take the couch, if you can get my exercise equipment out of the way.
I think I can handle it.
How sweet is this table, by the way, huh?
I got it from an actual benihana.
Cost me 4 grand.
Worth every penny.
Hai!
Can I interest anyone in an authentic a-Japanese a-break-a-fast?
Scrambled eggs eaten with chopsticks?
Okay.
Hai!
You know, maybe we should negotiate - while we're eating.
- No, what's the rush?
Plenty of time for that later.
You know what might put you in the mood to talk is a couple of brewskis and a calendar featuring some of your favorite female wrestlers.
Oh, yeah.
Knope, you know the way to a man's heart.
Yeah, okay.
Let's talk.
You got it.
These people won't leave.
One guy even looked in the bathroom.
Yeah, that means they like the place.
If you just leave them alone, I think we might get some offers.
This evergreen scented candle should help put people in the mood to buy.
You could just open the door and let the actual smell of the pines in.
Trees are sticky, and they got bugs in them.
This place is so random.
I don't know.
It's kind of, like, in the middle of nowhere.
I know.
That's, like, the hilarious part.
It's like a joke how long it takes to get here.
It's like a meta-cabin.
- Oh yeah.
- That's what I thought, yeah.
I heard that Dave Eggers wrote a short story about this tape cassette that he found under that tree over there.
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?
I'm trying to get these annoying dumdums to pay more money for your cabin.
Carry on.
Oh, my God, I heard that Neko Case and Ben Gibbard made out here once.
What?
Saturday at the firm with Ben.
Okay, we dissolve the loan-out and file bankruptcy.
That way only our clients have claim to the assets.
Great idea that we had a month ago.
The problem is, the trust still has claim to the property.
Then we dissolve the trust.
Clients "A," "B," and "F," they would have to agree, but if they went for it, we could arbitrate.
He's right.
We never thought of that.
Oh, oh!
Ben, Ben.
Say it again but this time I'm gonna turn the light on, like you just had an idea.
Sure, sure.
Yeah, I'm with you.
Um, okay.
What if we dissolve the trust?
Yes!
You just cracked the case.
I'm just doing my job.
Okay, here's an idea.
Maybe we name part of the park - the "Jamm Zone"?
- Hmm.
Yeah, Jamm could dig on that.
How about if in the Jamm zone, there's no married chicks allowed?
Caution, Jeremy.
I think there are people that will find the "No Married Chicks" zone both morally repugnant and hard to enforce.
All right.
Listen, let us celebrate this progress by sharing these authentic edamame, or Tokyo beans.
Now I want you to be very careful about eating these.
You eat the shells, and you throw the seeds out.
Wow.
You have really immersed yourself in Asian culture.
Now I think maybe we should revisit the holding bond idea.
Ugh, Lezzie.
Come on, I'm getting bored.
I mean, we've been at this for hours.
Can we please take a break?
Perhaps he has a point.
And we've made some progress.
Maybe we go home and take the rest of it up on Monday.
No, I cannot wait until Monday.
I need to close this deal now.
So I have an idea.
Let's have a change of venue and keep negotiating while we have fun.
If I remember correctly, you enjoy the ancient art of karaoke, yes?
I do.
And kudos on that pronunciation.
I remembered your favorite duet.
Maybe it's time to take this party to Rydell High.
Whoa!
I cannot wait to hear your Travolta.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm Sandra Dee.
That's more of my register.
You're Zuko.
He got friendly, holdin' my hand She got friendly down in the sand He was sweet, just turned 18 Well, she was good, you know what I mean?
Uh summer heat boy and girl meet but ah, oh, those summer nights I would like to buy five DVDs of this.
No, 20.
No, 60!
No, that's insane.
Dubee doo dubee doo dubee dubee dubee dow Good news.
We have multiple bidders.
That guy's getting his financials together.
Plans on tearing the whole place down, just wants it for the land.
Why would he want to tear down a perfectly good cabin?
I think he's a developer, wants to put in a luxury glamp-ground.
Glamping is "glamour camping".
Heated tents, catered meals, wi-fi-- You're describing a hotel.
And I think we still have traction with those two.
Oh, hey, man.
I love the mustache.
So funny.
You ever think about twisting it up at the ends, huh?
Use a little beeswax?
The open house is now closed.
We are not accepting bids at this time.
The sun sets in 95 minutes.
Good day.
That's part of the charm of this whole place-- the cantankerous old coot who owns it.
It's authentic!
I gotta say, that was pretty fun up there.
We have fun when we collaborate, right?
Working together?
Lockbox, right?
You know, in some weird, perverted, sexual way, I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
- Oh.
- You are my Nemesis.
You're the Superman to my Lex Luthor.
You want to be Lex Luthor?
Uh, yeah.
Lex Luthor is rich.
Well, okay.
I can't argue with that.
So I did Zuko for you.
Now you give me the lockbox.
Leslie put a beautiful cross into the box, Jeremy.
Time for you to head it in.
All right, Knope.
What can I say?
You wore me down.
I will give you my word, and I will put it in writing, so I can't back out.
We won't touch the money for one year.
And if the economy holds up, you can start construction then.
Leslie, you have your lockbox.
And you scored a triple dragon on your song.
No, I cannot wait a year.
I want to get started now.
I want construction started on Monday.
You have his word.
And this is riddled with spelling errors, - but it is binding.
- It's not good enough!
Jamm, I sang your stupid song, I ate your stupid fake Asian food, and by the way, you should know, you don't make sushi rolls out of tuna salad-- Maybe you don't.
I did practically everything you wanted, and you won't just give this to me today?
Screw you!
- You're giving a card to me?
- You left me no choice.
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Please, could you excuse us?
Leslie, you should be happy!
You beat Jamm in the final battle.
Unless there's something more going on here.
Ann.
This is about Ann.
Ann Perkins?
I love Ann Perkins.
Pawnee Commons is why I met Ann five years ago.
And I know you guys are talking about moving.
But I guess I thought if maybe Ann came back from Michigan tomorrow, and I was able to look into her smoky, ethnically ambiguous eyes and tell her that we were breaking ground on a new park, she might-- - she might want to stay.
- Leslie, I'm sorry.
Ann didn't just go to Ann arbor to visit family.
She went to sign the lease on our new home.
Ann arbor sounds disgusting.
She already has family there.
And I have a new job lined up at the University of Michigan.
Go blue!
It's a good town.
And it's a great place to raise a family.
What is great about it?
There's no JJ's Diner there.
There's no "Welcome to Pawnee" sign.
I mean, the stupid state is split up into two pieces!
It's ridiculous.
Unexpected play here, Superman.
Not exactly sure what you're going for, but I dig your Gambit.
There is no Gambit here, Jamm.
And who sides with Lex Luthor, by the way?
You probably watch Million Dollar Baby and root for the stool.
I haven't seen it.
Not a big Morgan Freeman guy.
I find his voice very grating.
I am leaving now.
I am not moving.
I'm just going home.
Are you guys coming back to my place?
What's--what's-- or are you guys going back to-- we wrapping up the weekend?
No?
Need a cup to perk me up coffee in the morning - Surprise!
- Oh, my God!
I hope you don't mind.
We decided to throw you a pizza party to say congrats for cracking the case.
Oh, my God, you guys.
See what we got here.
Wait a second.
That's not pizza.
Those are calzones!
- I love calzones!
- We know!
I think it's safe to say I made the right choice.
What's up, guys?
Hey!
BFF slideshow?
You know that even after we leave Pawnee, Ann will always be your best friend.
And it's not that long a trip.
Well, it would be even faster if the governor would return my calls about my Pawnee-to-Ann arbor bullet train idea.
You know, I went to Jamm's with you because I also want to leave the right kind of legacy, and that includes Pawnee commons.
Well, I think I burned that bridge with Jamm.
We're not gonna get that lockbox.
And I am not singing Beauty School Dropout.
It's sexist, and I don't do slow jams.
I have an idea.
And I'd like you to consider it a good-bye gift from me to you.
No, thank you.
I will let him know.
That was that couple you liked at the open house.
I despised them.
Well, they just came back with a new offer and jacked that shizz up.
Way over asking price.
Ron, who cares who they are?
That's a massive bid.
I'ma be a mogul.
I bought that cabin I do not care about the money.
I can't even understand what you're saying right now.
That cabin served an important purpose for me, as a quiet refuge from the nonsense of modern life.
I'd like the next owners to understand and share that purpose.
Find me someone like that, and I'll happily sell.
I'll buy it.
You can't afford that house.
Can you afford that house?
What would you use it for?
I'd go up there and take Andy and Champion and just get away from everyone else and look at spiders.
And it's where I'd bury the bodies of that annoying couple after I murder them.
Here's my offer.
I will give you everything in my purse.
$8, a bunch of loose cough drops, and Larry's asthma inhaler.
Thank God.
I've been looking for that.
Larry, this is part of a real estate transaction now.
You have no legal claim to it.
Sorry, I had no idea.
This is the best offer I've heard yet.
Uh, you tripping right now.
Sold.
Don't even trip.
Your commission.
Thanks a lot.
Your share, mogul.
I'm about to play golf with a guy who was almost on The Apprentice, so this better be good.
You give Leslie her lockbox, and you get me in your hip pocket.
Starting in my next term as city manager, I will give you one huge I.O.U., no questions asked.
Hmm.
Jamm likes the sound of that.
Let's make it five I.O.U.s, and you got a deal.
You drive a hard bargain, but you leave me no choice.
Fine.
Five huge IOUs.
Deal, guys.
You must really want that park.
I do.
Yes.
And to tell you the truth, I'm doing it all for my best friend.
That's all I wanted to hear.
Leslie, you're my best friend too.
Well, vote passed.
3-2.
Jamm is gonna be so pissed when he finds out that you're leaving and your I.O.U.s are worthless.
Are you sure you're okay with what you did?
Well, it's not the most ethical thing that I've ever done, but on the flip side, Jamm is a big, mean dope.
- Mm-hmm.
- And I hope that this eases some of the pain of us moving away a little bit.
Oh, I'm currently in deep denial that that's happening.
Speaking of which, how's the new gig coming?
Well, I got a raise, and my fridge is full of calzones, so not complaining.
The reason I ask is this town is gonna need a new city manager.
And I've talked to some people, and you have the votes if you want the job.
Wh-- Seriously?
Is this for realskis?
This is 100% certified for realskis.
- What do you say?
- I mean, I--wow.
I would be insane to say no.
Oh, no.
Wyatt, you're late.
I'm just kidding, you can do whatever you want.
Actually, Barney, I'm afraid I have some bad news.
Today's my last day.
I got an opportunity I couldn't say no to, and I have to quit.
Again.
No need to explain.
I knew it was too good to be true.
Oh, I do have a little going-away gift.
Left it in the break room.
If anyone could appreciate it, it's you guys.
"You can play with one warrior, "but it's just not nearly as good.
Enjoy.
Ben Wyatt".
Let's play.
- I call ledgerman!
- No.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Andy got back from London two days ago and he still has jet lag.
It's really annoying.
We're on totally different schedules.
Last night he mowed the lawn at 2:00 in the morning.
Andy!
Andy!
- Get me a beer?
- All right.
As soon as I wake up, he goes down.
Hard.
This has to stop!
Babe, wake up.
That's my spaghetti, Chewbacca.
Babe!
You hungry, Champion?
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?
Hey.
Oh, man, I fell asleep again.
Andy, you have got to stay up and get on a regular schedule.
Were you about to spray me with the hose inside the house?
- Yeah.
- I kinda want you to do it now.
- Okay.
- Aah!
Aah!
Aaahhh!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Okay, just a reminder, guys, today is Leslie's last day as a city councilor, so everyone be extra supportive.
Already done.
When she walked past me this morning, I gave her a kind nod.
Heartwarming.
Also I want to get her a present to cheer her up on her last day.
Any ideas?
A "sorry you lost your dream job" gift?
Mm, that's a tough one.
Stay away from wine.
Wine is crying juice.
Well, I mean, you know her better than anybody.
What does she really want?
More than anything in the world?
A nice candle.
I'm screwed.
No!
Andy!
- An-Andy!
- Oh!
Come on!
- Andy!
- Be right out.
Well, this is the Pawnee City Council chambers.
Your new home away from me.
Well, technically, my home away from home is in Zurich.
Frank Gehry designed it.
But this is nice too.
Today is my last day As a--excuse me.
Let me try this again.
Today is my last day at C-- Today is my la-- Today is my last d-- You know what?
You get the idea.
My old friend Ingrid de Forest won the recall vote, and she's taking my place on Monday morning.
But, you know, luckily for me, I've processed all my feelings.
And I've gone through the five stages of grief: Denial, anger, Internet commenting, cat adoption, African dance, cat returning to the adoption place, watching all the episodes of Murphy Brown, and not giving a flying fart.
How many stages is that?
I don't know.
The point is I'm fine now.
This must be hard for you.
It's like what sir Ian McKellen said to me the day I sold my boat to Karl Lagerfeld: "Parting is such sweet sorrow".
Oh, my God.
What is your life?
If it makes any difference, your work here was a real inspiration to me, and I am going to do my best to continue your legacy.
Well, I appreciate the sentiment.
Leslie.
I'm sorry.
Was I singing Goodbye Yellow Brick Road out loud?
No.
But would you like to?
I studied opera at the Sorbonne.
I'd be happy to harmonize.
Goodbye Goodbye Naw.
And finally, here is a check for the entirety of the purchase of Rent-A-Swag.
And here is a personal note from my client Dr. Saperstein.
"Dear Tom: I win.
"You suck.
Turn note over.
"You still suck.
Turn note over".
Okay, Saperstein couldn't even face me himself?
He had to send in his lackey?
My client isn't at this meeting because he doesn't have to be.
Successful people, Mr. Haverford, use their money to use others to work for them.
Hmm, it's an interesting idea, lawyer-dude.
What if I gave you 5 bucks to put a bag of poop in Saperstein's car?
No.
Ballpark me.
How much would it cost?
$10,000.
Counter-offer: Why don't you just do it for the story?
Goodbye, Mr. Haverford.
Is it done?
Well, how many times did he turn the paper over?
Oh, that is disappointing.
So look at this baby.
That is the most symmetrical fetus I've ever seen.
This could be a superhero.
- Dr. Saperstein.
- Yes.
I know that we should hate you because you destroyed our friend's business.
- But we love you so much!
- We love you!
I'm loveable!
So do you wanna know the sex?
Oh, my God.
Should we?
N-no, right?
Or maybe yes?
Is there an option other than yes or no?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna write it down.
Then I'm gonna put it in an envelope, seal it, and when you're ready, voila!
- That'll be fun!
- That's like the Oscars.
Hey, let's get some food.
I'm starving.
Wait, no, I have to pee.
Wait, no, I have to barf.
Actually, all three.
Being pregnant is great.
And, finally, Larry's share of the profit.
Whoa!
Good to be Larry.
No, it's not, you boring grandpa.
Meanwhile, Tommy's ridin' high.
$32,000.
I'm basically a millionaire.
What are you gonna do with the money, Tom?
Glad you asked.
A horrible man recently gave me some great advice.
For years, I've been coming up with my own ideas.
Like some sort of non-rich idiot.
Now I'm gonna let people come to me and invest my scrilla in the best idea I hear.
That sounds like an efficient use of the free market.
I would wish you the best of luck, but I believe luck is a concept invented by the weak to explain their failures.
Come hear the ideas with me, Ron.
I could use your wise, grandfatherly advice.
Do you think everyone here is a grandfather?
Basically, if you're older than me, you're a grandpa.
And if you are a grandpa, you're dead.
That sounds right.
Uh, oops.
This check is made out to "Lenny," which I think is a typo for "Larry," which isn't even actually my name.
Well, tell it to the bank, Lenny.
Am I--am I Lenny now?
I'd like to order a singing telegram.
Well, my wife lost her job, so maybe something sad and slow.
Do you know anything from The Requiem for a Dream soundtrack?
This is a bad idea.
I'm hanging up now.
Bye.
Well, Ingrid is settled into my office, and this box contains the last of my stuff.
Although I might have left some salt packets in my desk.
Maybe I should go back for those?
Honey, it's okay, there'll be other salt packets.
But not the kind that snaps in half, maybe.
Okay, I know I'm a broken record, but getting away from the City Council is absolutely the best thing for you.
Trust me.
This is Perd Hapley talking to you now about what's going on today.
We're live at City Hall where City Councilman Dexhart is addressing his latest sex scandal.
Recently, certain allegations have come to light about my inappropriate conduct.
I'm here to set the record straight.
I totally did all of it.
Another sex scandal?
This guy's unbelievable.
How does he find the time?
I also engaged in inappropriate texting, sexting, and tex-mexting, which is where you send photos of your junk from the restroom of a chili's to go.
- Hmm.
- Ew.
Does this make me a bad boy?
You tell me.
No.
Really.
Tell me.
It gets me off when women tell me that.
He's reading this, he wrote this down.
I sent these texts to roughly 100 women under the following pseudonyms: Enrique Shockwave, Willie Dynamite, Lee Harvey Teabag Well, at least you won't have to deal with that guy anymore.
- You're right.
- Lieutenant Wilhelm Von Penis.
Not after someone beats him in the next election.
Someone who is smart and hard-working and who knows the job because she's done it already and is also blond and named Leslie and loves you.
- Is it you?
- Yes!
It is!
I'm gonna run again.
I'm gonna beat Dexhart!
And Anthony Weiner.
Another City Council campaign?
Leslie, think about what you're saying.
I did.
I challenge you to find one flaw in my plan.
Well, for one, we don't even live in Dexhart's district.
Not yet!
But we can go and rent a second apartment, and we can spend 51% of our time there.
And then I'll file the campaign form from that address.
I don't want to spend 51% of our time in his district.
It's basically a dumping ground for old shipping containers.
It's like a raccoon shantytown.
Oh, it's not that bad.
And also, Dexhart fights dirty.
He's never lost an election because he runs brutal, scorched-earth campaigns.
So what?
I got plenty of dirt on that scumbag.
I say, "Bring it on".
So I'm gonna start my negative PR blitz against Dexhart and-- Look, I just think we need to take a deep breath Think about if this is really worth it.
Anything is worth me getting back on City Council.
Okay.
Let's see which one of these lucky visionaries is gonna make me rich.
Greg Phillips!
Hi, guys, thanks for meeting with me.
Enough chitchat.
What's your pitch, kid?
Come on, time is money, money is power, power is pizza, pizza is knowledge.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
So my idea is for an abacus, but on your phone.
I call it a "phone-bacus".
Son, you just described a calculator.
Hey, but you're talking about it, right?
Three words: Automated word counter.
Get out.
Two.
Words.
- No.
- One.
Word.
As you may know, I do like to tinker with things in my garage.
I'm gonna hit the can while he's up.
So I think I have discovered a way to generate clean, renewable energy.
I think it's gonna ch-- Oh!
Gross!
God, Larry.
You sneezed all over us!
I'm not gonna buy that thing.
It's covered in a gallon of your boogers.
I totally understand.
Uh, jeez.
I will be thrilled if we have a girl.
Oh, tiny dresses?
Braids?
Glitter on everything?
Forget it.
And also, girls' names are so cute.
Daisy, Annabelle, Lilly.
Olive, rosemary, chicken.
Fifty burritos.
Oh, my God, I'm starving.
Miss, hi!
I'm pregnant, and I'm a little bit crazy.
So if you don't bring our appetizers out in the next 30 seconds, I'm gonna plunge your face into the deep fryer!
And also two waters, please.
But no hurry.
Thank you.
Leslie, I don't know if there's a story in these emails.
They're iffy, but Dexhart has been elected eight times.
I don't think the voters care.
His poll numbers are actually up since the scandal broke.
Well, that's just because people found out he was Miley Cyrus' cousin.
- He is?
- Good morning, Leslie.
"Sweet jugs".
What?
He's kinda cute.
Oh, God, Shauna, no.
I-I just feel like I could fix him, you know?
This sucks!
We heard a hundred pitches, and they're all terrible.
Change of plans.
You guys are my idea factory.
- April, go.
- Okay, got one.
Macaroni and poison.
It's like mac and cheese, but with a special ingredient.
Ron?
Every socket set I've ever bought only goes up to 1/2 inch.
I'd love a couple larger sizes.
Take it all the way up to 5/8.
Andy?
Bears bouncing on trampoline roads.
There's a chance that I might have dreamed that.
Okay, time to head back to the office.
I've missed an entire day of work, so at least some good came from this.
What are you doing?
Well, they couldn't make a banner in time for my press conference, so I am cobbling together a banner from all the other discarded banners.
"Second chunce four Lesle!
"Perv Dexxxhrt equals - birthday mouse"?
- Rat!
Well, that's the closest thing I could get to a rat.
Leslie, listen to yourself.
Loopholes, scorched-earth policies.
This isn't you.
I cannot believe you aren't supporting me on this!
Dexhart has a sex scandal the same day I'm leaving office?
That is not a coincidence.
This was meant to be.
You know what?
Why don't we gather everyone in here, you explain to them what you're thinking, and, uh, we get some feedback.
Now you're talking.
I would be thrilled if we had a boy.
I have perfected the art of shaving the human face.
And I would love to be able to pass that on.
Toy trucks?
Superhero costumes?
Tiny little acorn penis?
Forget it.
A weird image.
But one that does not diminish my enthusiasm.
Well, Ann Perkins, are you ready to find out the sex of our baby?
I'm ready.
We are having a "distributions".
That's what it looks like: Distributions.
Let me see that.
It says "congratulations," I think.
Then it says, "Ileg smurf".
Are we having a smurf?
We are having a "11-jewel toilet".
I can't tell what's words and what's punctuation!
The suspense is killing me!
I'm calling Dr. Saperstein.
I'm calling Domino's.
Do you think Domino's delivers to this restaurant?
- I hope so.
- Oh, no.
He's out for the rest of the day!
I have literally never been more stressed out.
Oh, good!
You guys are here!
Okay, everybody gather around.
I have a big announcement.
I am officially seeking reelection to the Pawnee City Council.
I am gonna be running for Dexhart's seat.
And the campaign starts now.
Oh, I love the sound of silence before a big cheer.
That's what's happening, right?
Leslie, no offense.
I've heard a lot of bad ideas today.
- This is the worst.
- April?
I would love it if you ran an insane campaign and basically turned into the joker.
But that means you probably shouldn't do it.
- Andy?
- I don't know, Leslie.
It seems risky.
And I'd hate to see you go through another tough fight.
But I could be wrong.
I haven't pooped in three days.
Okay, Ron, you have always given me sage counsel.
And your words carry great influence so what do you think I should do?
I do not think you should run again.
What the hell do you know, Dum-Dum?
All of you!
Look, this is my only option.
I am running again with or without you.
Leslie, you're running for office again?
What a great idea!
How can I help?
Ugh Well, no one else any good business ideas.
So I decided to take care of it myself.
Talking tissue!
Any time you pull one out, you get a little message to hype you up.
Blow that nose, playah!
No.
This stinks.
I'm just gonna have to go back to my same job that I've had forever.
Yeah, I get why you're bummed out.
I mean, look at me.
I'm younger than you, and I already have my own department.
Plus I'm married, and I make more money than you.
Whatever.
You just merged your department with parks then made up your own title.
Yeah.
It's awesome.
I'm empty, yo.
Fill me up.
Do that again.
What could you possibly need at 6:00 in the morning?
We couldn't read your writing, and we need to know the sex of our baby.
I'm watching cartoons with my son.
Daddy!
An Elmer Fudd one is on!
Stop it.
Hey, what's up, beautiful?
Jean-Ralphio.
I live in the guesthouse.
What do you say you and I get together in a special way?
I-I'm pregnant.
- The more the merrier.
- With my baby.
Well, you can come too, beautiful.
Look at that.
I guess sometimes I call men "beautiful" too.
I guess I'm open-minded as hell.
And I think you're pretty good-looking.
- Thank you.
- Can you just read that and tell us what the sex is, please?
Wow.
It looks like the chicken that wrote this had a stroke on the paper.
Listen, I-I kind of remember.
But I don't want to say anything that's wrong.
Give me 15 minutes.
I will get dressed.
We'll go down to my office.
Okay.
Well, have a good day at work today, daddy.
Also, if you don't know already, there's a malfunction with the TV, where it keeps ordering porno, like, a ton of porno.
Like, how can someone watch that much porno in one sitting?
Only when you're out of the house.
So if you see it on the bill, that's why.
Okay?
"And therefore, with your help, "we can make our future bright.
I believe I still have a lot to offer this city".
I'd swap those two lines.
Always helps to end on the call to action.
I'm sorry if it felt like everyone piled on.
We were just being honest.
But if you really want to do this, of course we'll support you.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I stormed out.
You know, I've been thinking for weeks of what to get you as a "last day in City Council" present.
And I finally figured it out.
You remember Jen Barkley, political consultant and power broker?
Hey!
Jen!
What brings you back to Pawnee?
Ben bought one hour of my time.
I heard you need some consulting?
Well, uh, I guess.
I mean, how are you?
How's your family?
Okay, I get paid $1,200 an hour.
Do you really wanna spend any of that time talking about my mother and her Well, that does sound fascinating.
But you're right, let's talk.
Okay.
I'll get the chair.
Ron!
That's how I enter rooms now.
It's more dramatic.
Why did you enter at all?
Because I have some huge news.
You're looking at Pawnee's new business liaison.
I don't like French words.
I do like the word "business".
You may continue.
April created a new position for herself, and I wanna do the same.
The town could use more private-sector money after the merger.
So as business liaison, I would find companies looking to move or expand, and convince them to do it in Pawnee.
Now this is a good idea.
You've come a long way, son.
And while I got you here talking tissue.
Go for it.
Yo, dog!
Life is what you make of it.
Leave while I'm ahead?
You got it.
Clear them sinuses, playboy!
Someone's got the sniffies.
Tell your mama you love 'er.
Step up your vitamin "C" game, bro!
So they recall me after all I've done for them.
Ridiculous.
But Dexhart now has another sex scandal.
Of course he does.
And the plan is I'm gonna run for his seat.
Because how do I lose to a guy like that?
- That's a great idea, right?
- It's a terrible idea.
I knew it.
Wait.
What?
First of all, you could lose to a guy like that.
Terrible people defeat great people all of the time.
I should know.
Those terrible people have paid me so much money, I have a condo in every virgin island.
Now you might win.
You're smart, Ben is smart, you might win.
But why would you want to?
Because it's my dream job.
Then dream bigger.
Look, you love this town.
It's being run by monsters and morons?
Get a better job!
Rise above their heads.
Affect change at a higher level.
Don't be the kid that graduates high school, hangs out in the school parking lot.
Be the woman who moves away, climbs the ladder, and then confidently comes back and has sex with her hot old English teacher just for kicks.
Is that what you did?
Yeah.
Mr. Baker.
Sex was pretty good, thanks to me.
Look, Pawnee has done you a favor.
You've outgrown them.
You've got talent, and you've got name recognition.
Which means that you have a bright, wide-open future with a thousand options.
State Senate.
Federal jobs.
Even congress.
All of these are doable for you.
And you can trust me because I don't care enough about you to lie.
Uh-oh.
Oh, time's up.
Okay, if you want to keep talking, you're gonna have to pay me - I just need-- - No, I swear to God, if you say one more word, you will legally owe me $1,200, and I will sue you.
Let's not end it like that.
Okay, great to see you, Leslie.
Those five words are on me.
Should I move this back?
Don't answer it!
I don't know what you're thinking, but you have a press conference in ten minutes.
Well, this is it The final moment..
What are you hoping for?
I will honestly be happy either way.
Me too.
Boy or girl, it doesn't matter.
Because it will literally be the greatest child who's ever lived.
You swear you have no preference?
You?
Not at all.
Who's ready?
Raise your hand.
- It's a boy!
- Yes!
I thought you didn't have a preference.
I didn't.
I just really wanted it to be a boy.
Me too.
I don't know why.
You guys are just so neat.
Would you be interested in adopting my children?
They're in their late 20s, they're terrible.
No?
No go?
I ask all my patients.
I've gathered you all here today because I have an announcement, a very big announcement, about my future.
I will be heading to lunch today with my husband.
At JJ's diner.
We will eat waffles.
And then we will go home and make out on our couch.
That is my future.
For now.
It's been an honor to serve this town.
And I will cherish the memories forever.
Thank you.
- Ms. Knope!
- There you have it.
A shockingly unshocking press conference in which a recently unemployed woman said nothing of importance.
I'm Perd Hapley, and I just realized I'm not holding my microphone.
Jen Barkley telling me I had a future was the best present I could have got.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
But, I did get you one other present to take your mind off all this.
Aww, you are the sweetest man in the world.
Where is it?
Well, it's not here.
We have to go get it.
In times of stress or in moments of transition, sometimes it can feel like the whole world is closing in on you.
When that happens, you should close your eyes, take a deep breath, listen to the people that love you when they're giving advice, and remember what really matters.
And, if you have the ability to go to Paris, by all means, got to Paris!
- I found one!
- Oh, great!
- Mm, right here.
- Yeah?
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I am here to interview for the Deputy Parks Director job.
Leslie, this is ridiculous.
It's your job.
Take it.
Well, I should have to interview - just like everyone else.
- Mm.
Now, if you'll see on my resume, I held the position of deputy director of parks and recreation for almost ten years.
I know.
I was your boss.
I also walked you down the aisle at your wedding.
Take the job and leave me alone.
Come on, Ron.
Just interview me.
- No special treatment.
- Okay, fine.
What do you believe should be the ultimate goal of this department?
The ancient Greek version of the park was the agora, a gathering place where people from all walks of life-- What are you writing?
Is it good?
What do you think is the best use of our yearly budget?
It's right there in the name: Maintaining our beautiful parks and providing healthy outdoor recreation.
I'm sorry, Ms. Knope, the correct answer is "Give it all back to the taxpayers".
It seems you and I have fundamentally different philosophies.
Frankly, it's a miracle we ever worked together without killing each other.
- Good day.
- Ha, ha, okay.
No more goofing around.
Just tell me I have the job.
I have a lot of other people to meet with.
- I'll be in touch.
- Ron, come on, it's me.
Give me special treatment.
Okay, first morning meeting back in the old conference room.
What's this?
Oh, it shows everyone's spirit dogs.
- That one's you.
- You guys think I'm a border collie?
So obviously a cocker spaniel.
The spirit dog committee ruled on that weeks ago.
- There is no appeals process.
- No.
Totally.
I'm in on the joke.
I get it, but maybe we should stop talking about your insane dog choices and get to working.
Classic border collie.
Has to control everything.
Totally.
First on the agenda: I'm gonna bring my lemonade stand idea to the small business coalition, and a little birdie told me it's already in the bag.
- Can I get a what-what?
- What?
- What?
- Thank you.
No.
What idea?
The fella who runs the hot stew stand in Lafayette Park is retiring, so Pawnee's new business liaison--Tom-- went out and got the Indiana Brothers juice company to rent it out as a lemonade stand.
Wow.
Plus, I downloaded this dope app that pops champagne whenever I say something awesome.
- Tom, that's great.
- I know.
- And it was only 9 bucks.
- No, I mean, the lemonade-- never mind.
Well, I will start doing an environmental impact study, and Ron, you can do some demographic research.
Don't sweat it, Lez-kno.
Tommy's taking care of every last detail.
Nothing I can do to help?
Okay.
Oh.
I can straighten this for you.
There we go.
Oh, Larry.
We've been taking pictures all over City Hall to show our unborn baby where we met.
- Would you mind?
- Oh, my gosh.
I would be honored.
Say, when are you crazy kids gonna get hitched?
Well, you know, actually, we haven't discussed it in a while.
No, it's kind of taken a back seat.
Well, you know, to each his own, but you guys really seem like you're in love.
And when I see a couple who look at each other the way you do, I don't know, it just makes me think that maybe this crazy world is gonna be okay.
That literally went on forever.
I thought you were never gonna stop talking.
But now that you have Ann Perkins, will you marry me?
Wow.
Cracker dust.
Uh, I mean, yes, of-- of course, l-let's do it.
Can I have a sip of your water, please?
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm--I'm a bit of a germaphobe.
Oh, no, no, totally understand.
Ann Perkins I'm gonna cough it out.
I would like to spend the rest of my life with you.
I love you.
I love you too.
No part of this is how I pictured it.
I thought another cracker might push it through, but I was wrong.
- Let's do this right.
- Yeah.
Let's go get an engagement ring.
Yes.
That was a beautiful moment.
- Hello, France!
- Mm.
You guys enjoying that cheese?
It's unpasteurized.
What's that mean?
- Unpasteurized?
- I don't care.
I don't care.
Technically, it's illegal in this country.
I smuggled it back from Paris.
Anyway, I want you guys to think of my office as a clubhouse, total open-door policy.
I wanna be your friend as well as your boss.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Are you in a cult?
Can I join?
- Let's sacrifice Larry.
- Oh, April.
It's my first day as city manager, so I'm holding open office hours to break the ice.
Now, Chris was always the nice guy that made everyone happy, while I brought down the hammer.
But now that he's gone, I kind of have to do both.
Everyone is the best.
We're cutting vacation time.
Let's eat vitamins.
This is exhausting.
Listen real quick.
I have some super cool new rules - Oh, nice.
- That are also super mandatory.
Uh, we can't use Facebook anymore?
- Are you serious?
- That's right.
Massive time waster.
Kills productivity.
Hey, sanitation.
Listen, let's talk health insurance.
Your dependents don't have it anymore.
Have some illegal cheese.
No cell phone usage on City Hall property?
That's not fair, my cell phone is how I avoid doing work.
Bathroom breaks should be limited to five minutes?
I can't shower in five minutes.
See, he's acting all loosey-goosey, but that little dude's wound so tight, - he's gonna pop.
- Hey, sanitation sanitation in the house tonight Oh, what happened to our spirit dogs?
I came up with a way better game.
Behold your spirit kangaroo.
Tom, you are a blue flyer.
So am I. So are you and Donna.
And look at Ron.
Look at Ron.
I mean-- Doesn't Ron look exactly like a blue flyer?
There aren't that many different types of kangaroos.
Either way, hell of a game, right, guys?
Presentations are upon us, so, Tom, which step are you at in The Leslie Knope Project Preparedness Super System?
Yeah, once you got on the city council, - we kinda stopped doin' that.
- What?
Tom, no, you cannot drop The Leslie Knope Project Preparedness Super System.
It was developed over thousands of government presentations that I gave over the past ten years.
- It is my very soul.
- Well, I have my own system.
Step one: Chill out a bit.
Step two: Get up there and rip it.
That's your plan?
To--to rip it?
Leslie, this is Tom's project.
Perhaps you should let him do things his way.
Sure, yeah, you should probably just rip it.
I think that's better than going with a tried and true that led to-- and I quote-- "The most thorough and, dare we say, at times, over-prepared presentation that we've seen".
And yeah, that quote came from the Indiana blue ribbon panel on irrigation and drainage.
Fine, I'll go back to your system.
- You're the big dog around here.
- Big kangaroo.
And thank you.
Well, yeah, I was gone for a while and things are a little different around here, but this is still my house.
I invented this parks game, son.
Oh.
Damn it!
When did they put a lamp here?
Hey.
The boys in blue?
Ah, what can I do for you for?
We got a tip about some food entering the country illegally.
No--no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Thi--it's just cheese, guys.
Uh, I got it in France.
Okay.
Did you declare it on your customs form when you reentered the country?
We're gonna need you to come down to the station.
I'm sure that's not necessary.
Let's just-- this is really good cheese.
- You should try some.
- Are you trying to bribe us?
No!
Oh, God.
I surrender.
- Step forward.
- Okay, okay.
There you go.
This is so exciting.
Hi, folks.
When's the big day?
I assume this is a, you know Oh.
No.
This isn't a shotgun wedding, although, yes, she is pregnant, and, yes, we did just decide to get married today.
We haven't told our families or chosen a venue, but it's not a shotgun wedding.
We've been planning ours for months.
You wouldn't believe how much there is to do.
Invitations, table settings, color scheme, dance lessons.
And that's just for the rehearsal dinner.
Oh.
Seriously, that's just for the rehearsal dinner.
That sounds elaborate.
All we did was punch "jewelry store" into our car GPS.
You remember that romantic moment, Chris?
I was getting gas.
No, I don't remember it.
Hey, Tom, I don't mean to bug you or anything, but I notice that my super system binder is closed.
Just checking that you had a chance to refamiliarize yourself entirely.
Yeah, flipped through it.
Looks good.
Huh.
You're lying.
I placed a single strand of hair along the edge, and that secret strand is unbroken.
Whose hair is that?
It's brown.
Look, it seems like you don't even care about your presentation.
Au contraire.
I'm working on it right now.
And what's the most important part of a presentation?
- Content.
- The presentation.
Okay.
Tom, you need hard data.
You need facts to make your case.
And then you need two funny quotes and an inspirational one.
You know, a classic ha-ha-hmm.
Look, I think you need to take a page out of my system and chill out a bit, okay?
I got this.
Okay, fine, I trust you.
But I think you're gonna fail, and you're a ticking time bomb.
- What's that?
- Nothing, good luck.
- This is an elk hair.
- Yes.
It's the most effective hair for binder security.
You know that, Ron.
If Tom gives that presentation, it is going to be a total disaster for both him and the department.
I cannot sit idly by and watch this terrible thing happen.
I mean, I can barely sit idly by and watch good things happen.
We've got a couple of customs agents coming down from the border, and they are not happy.
I can't believe this.
I never break the law.
- I've never even jaywalked.
- Never?
I mean, I-I-I-- everyone does it sometimes.
Just add that to the charges.
Well, well, well, we got a hit on your prints.
Seems you're wanted for tax fraud in Colorado?
What?
I've never even been to Colorado.
I mean, I had a layover in Denver once.
Man, you can't keep your story straight, can you?
- Come on!
- Oh.
Here comes the customs guys now.
Fellas, he's all yours.
You're pranked.
You gotta see the stupid look on your face.
Check this out.
I took a picture.
- Classic!
- You seemed a little uptight.
Thought we'd have some fun with our new boss.
Wow.
Thi--you got me.
Good one, makin' me think I was gonna like die in federal prison Ah, that's super funny, you scamps.
Now, Stu, I know that you're thinking about retiring, and I am here to ask you to reconsider.
What do you say?
Keep that Lafayette Park stand open, pumpin' out the stew like you do.
I don't know.
I'm looking forward to spending time with my wife, working on some new hobbies.
I was thinking about getting into bisques.
Stu, you have been a staple in the parks department system for years.
Retirement is for the birds.
You're gonna be so bored.
I'm gonna say this because you need to hear it.
Screw bisque.
- That makes a lot of sense.
- Yeah.
What now?
What do I do?
Well, we're gonna need to convince the business council to keep you around, but that's not for you to worry about.
I'll take care of it.
You just keep on stewin' what you stew.
Thanks, Leslie.
This calls for a toast.
Susan?
Stew flutes, please.
Ah.
To stew.
Mm.
Oh, my God.
- That's very hot.
- Mm-hmm.
Congratulations.
This is a beauty.
If you like, I could engrave the date on the inside of the band.
That may be tough, 'cause we actually haven't discussed it yet.
We could engrave "2014" - or "TBD".
- Hang on.
If neither of us has ever thought about this stuff, then maybe there's a reason.
When you think about it, we are already more married than most married people.
Right?
I mean, we're having a child together.
We're moving to a new city.
You let me pee with the door open so I could watch the end of Grey's Anatomy.
That was a fantastic season finale and a show that is literally a never-ending roller coaster of emotion.
I mean, why spend thousands of dollars just to reaffirm what we already know, which is that we love each other?
That is so beautiful.
Theodore, we would like to return that ring.
And get a refund, please.
Maybe we should talk this over too.
- Oh, come on.
- Think what we could do if we didn't buy this ring.
I mean, this could go towards buying a house.
You have a lovely store.
- Hey, boss?
- Hey.
I was just printing out my minesweeper high score, and I noticed this memo.
You're punishing us for the prank?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's just like a warning memo.
Like, "Hey, all in good fun, "but I'm your boss, and if you do it again, you're suspended".
- That kind of thing.
- Listen.
I know that you're the governor or whatever, and I'm just government junior.
- What?
- I feel like you're blowing it.
If you want people to like you, you have to play along.
Don't punish Donna and April.
Prank them back.
I guess I could stand to loosen up a little, but I don't know how to pull a prank.
Dude, okay.
Well, I could help you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I once did the best prank of all time.
I dumped all of my boss's action figures - into a fish tank.
- Yeah, that was me.
And I didn't really like it.
Classic.
Great news, guys.
- I just saved your bacon.
- Impossible.
You don't even know where it is.
I know you were excited to get in front of the committee and rip it, but in the spirit of teamwork, I unilaterally decided to bring Stu out of retirement.
- So pressure's off.
- What?
- I spent a lot of time on this.
- Doin' what, - putting mousse in your hair?
- It's a gel-based serum.
Second of all, who uses mousse still?
Oh, God.
Leslie.
Let's put our differences aside for a second.
Friend to friend, do you still use mousse?
No, I use the juicy space thing--whatever you do.
The point is you weren't ready for this, Tom.
Stu's sales are flat.
Lemonade's the future.
I'm still doing my presentation.
I'm still doing my stew presentation, and we'll see which one the committee likes.
- Fine.
- Fine.
Yeah.
I didn't think so.
On the other hand, there are some benefits to being married: Taxes, health insurance, and I don't have to feel weird when hotel employees call me "Mr. Perkins".
Yeah, that makes me feel weird too.
Maybe we should.
I don't know anymore.
"Maybe we should.
I don't know anymore".
Ann, that is a beautiful sentiment.
Okay, you're all set.
Credit card's been fully refunded.
Perfect timing.
We are going to buy this ring.
Charge it.
Ann Perkins, will you marry me?
- I don't know!
- Me either!
- Maybe let's not?
- Yeah, I think maybe not.
Okay.
Ring's yours again.
Hello?
Actually, we don't want the ring.
Unbelievable.
Leslie, look.
I'm the last person to want to deprive the world of more stew, but are you sure you wanna do this?
Look, I love Tom, but you and I both know that he's not ready to step up.
Don't you remember his last presentation on topsoil?
The botched laser show?
Larry still can't see purple.
That was Larry's fault.
He picked up the laser and stared right into it.
I know, but still, Tom is all flash - and no substance.
- That's the old Tom.
You've been gone for a while, Leslie.
Tom has changed.
He ran a business, sold it for a profit.
He's also been working here for six years, and he's learned a lot from you.
At some point, you're gonna have to trust him to do his job.
You guys.
You guys.
- Be cool.
- What's going on?
I kind of convinced Ben to prank you guys, and it got a little out of hand.
I probably should've said no to some of his ideas, but he's on his way here right now.
Here he is.
Just be cool.
Hey, guys.
What's up?
Um, oh, I just remembered.
Can I show you something out to the front area?
And leave your cell phones because of no reason.
Just leave anything that can't get wet, actually, like you would normally.
Okay, here we go to the parking lot now.
Wow, this is really sad.
Yep, follow to me, guys.
Just going to the parking lot for normal government reasons.
Sorry, can't go through with this.
I was gonna pull a prank.
- No!
- Yeah.
I hired these guys in ski masks to kidnap us, and I was gonna pretend to be a hero.
They were gonna shoot me and drive the van into the river, and that's when the divers would go in, pull you guys out of the water, and I would be standing on the shore like, "Hey, you get pranked much"?
What the?
I even got these squibs from a special effects guy, and I was gonna say this code word.
And that's when I would push this button.
No, no, no, no, no!
Oh, my God.
You got blood all over me.
Thank you.
I mean it.
- Ben, that was amazing.
- Really?
Best prank ever.
I'm sorry, buddy, daddy can't get home to tuck you in.
Oh, how old is your son?
Just pick a thing.
Honey, look at this.
This is what I want.
I don't want a ring.
I don't want a wedding.
I just want this locket with a picture of our child in it.
I mean, we've never been traditional.
We made out the first night we ever met.
And when we did date, we broke up, but you didn't realize it, and that was very embarrassing for you.
Yeah, let's maybe not talk about that part right now.
And then we got pregnant as friends, and then we fell in love.
We've never been very conventional, so why start now?
Theodore?
We will not be needing that ring, but we would like to purchase this locket.
How much?
Just take it and get outta here.
- Thank you!
- Thanks.
We're here to discuss a business contract for the Lafayette Park food stand.
Miss Knope, you've always steered this committee in the right direction.
Why do you think we should renew Hot Stu's lease?
Well, frankly, it's because of Stu.
Here's a man who was ready to retire, spend time with his family, travel.
And then he realized, "No, I wanna spend my time "in a small metal box all summer, bent over a boiling cauldron of steaming, bubbling meat".
Making stew is hard: Up at the crack of dawn, backbreaking labor, your clothes smelling like salt and gristle.
Sure, profits are minimal, but Stu doesn't care about that.
Maybe a year extension isn't enough.
Maybe we should make it five years.
Heck, why don't we give him a lifetime deal?
I'd like to see Stu ladling out his pungent beef smoothies until we bury him under that shed.
I think I've made a terrible mistake.
Okay, that was bleak.
Uh, Mr. Haverford, you have a presentation as well?
Hey.
Rip it.
There's nothing more American than lemonade.
Just sayin' the word makes you wanna drink some.
And now you can.
Check under your seats.
Heh, hey.
Has my name on it.
Yes, it does.
Classic for you, Carter.
Darva, yours is a pink lemonade.
- I know you love that.
- Because I like pink.
That's right.
Now, who here likes laser shows?
Summer foot traffic in Lafayette Park has increased 23%.
The Indiana Brothers are the fastest-growing beverage company in the Midwest.
My projections show they can increase government revenue 30% over the next five years.
Plus, they've agreed to waive their franchise fee.
Look, guys, I'm sorry about all the new rules, But--you know, I want you to like me.
But I-I also really need you to respect me.
I respect you, little buddy.
Come here.
Mm, respect noogie.
Ah!
We didn't prank you 'cause we don't respect you.
We did it 'cause we love you.
R-e-s-p-e-g-c Well, that's actually not how respect is spelled.
- Yes.
- According to Urethra Franklin, that's exactly how it's spelled.
Hey, Wyatt.
You were a good sport earlier.
No hard feelings?
Here's a little gift for you for believing in me.
- Oh.
- It's a gel-based hair serum.
Enough with the mousse, for real.
Okay.
Well, Ron, you were right.
Tom has really grown up.
You seem merely overjoyed instead of irritatingly ecstatic.
- Why?
- Well, Tom's come into his own.
April runs Animal Control.
I mean, does this department even need me anymore?
No.
We do not.
April and Tom started out as two of the most apathetic people I had ever met.
It's why I hired them.
Then you betrayed me and turned them into efficient and caring government employees.
This office can indeed function without you.
And soon, it'll have to.
Was that a death threat?
We both know you're not gonna be here forever.
This is a weigh station on the road to bigger and better things.
Whenever you do move on, it should please you to know that-- God help me-- you've built a well-functioning government agency.
Oh, that reminds me.
I know you don't open your mail, but I do.
And because you created Tom's position-- business liaison-- and it's already financially paying off, you have received Pawnee's government employee of the month.
I mean, it has taken--
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
I've got to say that this report is quite impressive, Miss Knope.
Thank you very much, Mr. City Manager.
And I have to say that the way that you're rockin' those slacks is quite impressive as well.
Well, thank you.
- Can we hurry this up, please?
- What?
There's nothing wrong with acknowledging the fantastic work of one of your employees, especially if she's adorable.
I am back at the parks department, and Ben is city manager, but we're married, so it's kosher.
And awesome.
We live together - And work together.
- And we are so In sync That we finish each other's Sentences!
We rehearsed that at home.
Naked in bed.
- What!
- What!
Please stamp the form.
I just want to admire it one more time.
Again, fantastic work.
In fact, such good work I think I'm in love with you.
Oh, my God, that's great news, 'cause I'm in love with you too.
- What?
- What?
Stamp the form.
Okay, let's not let Ron feel left out.
We love you too, Ron.
- Stamp the damn form.
- Group hug!
Oh, I'm down for a group hug.
- Little G.H. - Bring it in.
Come o-- Wow.
I think our love made him angry.
I think he broke my wrist.
I'm not kidding.
Really?
Good morning, Ann Perkins.
How are you feeling today?
Perfect.
Except that I'm a whale and that my feet already kill.
Whales don't have feet.
I am a crazy shape.
This morning when I got out of bed, I just tipped forward like a poorly made bowling pin.
Did I mention that my feet kill me all the time?
Oh!
Let me rub them.
Oh, wait.
No.
I read something on raddadsolutions.net that there's a pressure point in the foot that could induce labor.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I don't care.
I'm gonna go choke down those horse pills I have to take every day.
Oh, no, no, I'll cut them in half for you.
And I will pour you a glass of flaxseed milk to wash it down.
Everything is amazing.
Today is perfect, and I love you.
Chris is so wonderful and thoughtful and positive.
He's driving me up the wall.
Smoothie's ready!
Opening this farmers market was one of my greatest achievements as city councilor.
It's good for the economy, it's good for families, and it's good for promoting a healthy lifestyle, which Pawnee desperately needs.
Look at this tiny tree.
Can you eat this?
Aww.
This one's dead.
Hey, Connie Cabbage.
What's good today?
Green cabbage is always a safe bet.
Red cabbage is good.
I mean, you can't go wrong.
That's the fun thing about cabbage.
One of the fun things.
Oh!
Time to crank this market up a notch, y'all!
"Chardbodies: Get a chard on"?
Let's get "re-charded" in here!
- What the hell is going on?
- Oh, yeah.
That's the new chard stand.
I suppose that's one way to sell vegetables.
We got Swiss chard, we got white chard, we got chard poppers!
And for all you freaky vegans out there We got chard shots!
Yeah!
Mmm, chard is so bitter.
Ben, do something.
What do you want me to do?
Well, you're the city manager.
Kick them out.
They're violating every single one of the farmers market's rules of conduct.
By "rules of conduct," do you mean that wooden sign you made that says, "Peas be kind to others"?
Yes, and "In case of fire, romaine calm," and "You won't bay leaf how nice olive our vendors are".
I don't like vegetables, but I'm very good at vegetable puns.
Okay, I admit this is a little iffy, but - A little iffy?
- I can't do anything until I check the rules for city vendors.
Cabbage!
Come andget it.
Connie, no.
Put those away.
April's sitting on my lap I shouldn't tell her that I gotta take a crap oh, no - Don't.
- I should just go Oh, my God.
You play guitar?
No, that's a super small piano.
Okay, I'm gonna need the sarcasm to take a long walk right now.
My terrible nephew Sebastian is having his sixth birthday party this weekend, and the clown they hired has shingles.
You think your band could play for an hour?
- How much?
- 75.
$75,000?
How about 300?
$300,000?
- 150.
- They'll do it.
Ah, thank you.
That is such a relief.
I love my nephew very much, but he's a horrible little tyrant, so don't ruin this day for him!
Split that four ways, boom.
$600.
I'll say it again: The men's room needs a separate dispenser for face wash.
I can't wash my face with hand soap.
Look at these pores.
They're gaping.
- Hey, guys.
- Time-out.
Let's take a brief recess.
Can we help you, Ann?
I was looking for Leslie, but now I'm curious why you guys are sitting around doing nothing and getting drunk at work.
It's the whine & cheese club, gorgeous.
It's a monthly gathering where we all get together and vent about what annoys us at work.
Over fine wines and cheeses, of course.
Larry, salami!
The human resources department requires that I be available once a month to discuss workplace disputes with my employees.
The rules do not specify whether or not I'm allowed to listen to Willie Nelson on my headphones.
And Kyle parked his car in my spot again.
Now, that is the fourth time this month.
Hello, walls - Hello - Hello how'd things go for you today?
I just want to choke him until he passes out.
- Time.
- This looks like fun.
I want to try.
Mm, there's rules to this, sweet pea.
It's Donna's turn next.
I'll cede my time to Ann.
I have a feeling this is gonna be good.
Okay, well, I'm not gonna talk for long, 'cause I have to pee again, 'cause I have to pee every six minutes, 'cause I have a beach ball in my stomach that's punching on my bladder.
That sucks.
I know.
And I'm never not hungry.
- Oh, well, have some cheese.
- I can't have cheese, Larry!
And I can't have wine either.
I can't have anything good.
You know, what I can have is liquefied flaxseed.
But I don't want that.
You know what I want?
Pork rinds.
I want jelly beans.
And I want a huge trash bag filled with mashed potatoes.
I want to be Pac-Man, and instead of dots, I want 'em to be cinnamon buns.
I want to be a giant head and a mouth, and I just want to eat rows and rows of junk food pellets, and where's my trash bag of potatoes?
Time.
Yikes.
Okay, Harrison Ford movie night.
Before we do that, I was thinking more about that chard guy.
I mean, it would be very easy for you to revoke their license.
Okay, Leslie, this is city business, and I'm not an emperor.
I can't just kick them out for no reason.
The reason is it's vegetable porn.
Porn on the cob.
I'm sorry.
I'm just very good at that.
Look, I am not a prude, but the point is, people shouldn't be half naked, you know, in public, in the middle of the day, in front of children.
There's your reason.
Kick them out.
Look, now that we're working together again, maybe it would be good to keep our home life and our work life separate.
Like we only talk about work stuff when we're at city hall, like a firewall system.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
That's smart.
Home is home, and work is work.
We can always talk about this tomorrow at the office.
Good.
Glad you agree.
All right.
Crystal Skull it is.
No, it's ridiculous to think that you could survive a nuclear blast by jumping into a refrigerator.
- Mm-hmm, yeah, uh-huh.
- But still, it's like-- Okay, so I found a legal precedent to shut down those vegetable smut peddlers.
What is happening?
Firewall, man.
We pulled into the parking lot, and this is technically city hall property, so now we're at work-- let's do this.
The farmers market is a community meeting place, and that pan-sexual stripper show basically negates the whole purpose.
So if you're looking for a reason to kick them out, here's 158.
The new farmers market rule book.
Okay, when did you make this?
I stayed up all night.
I also made these-- Leslie's toffee surprise.
The surprise is there's toffee in the inside.
You can eat those once you revoke the chard vendor's license.
Good day, colleague.
Okay.
Ann Perkins!
How are you feeling?
You don't want to know.
It's all I want to know.
All right, man, you asked for it.
I have shooting pains that go all the way up from my butt to my neck.
My stomach has so many stretch marks on it that it looks like an old-fashioned globe.
My boobs are getting really sore.
Also, I just read Brooke Shields' book on post-partum depression.
Now I have pre-post-partum depression anxiety.
Well, never fear.
I will get you Tylenol for your pain and shea butter for your belly.
And your voluptuous figure only means your body is working exactly as nature intended it.
There, it's all good.
Is that better?
Yeah.
Thanks.
I've been reading up on nipples.
The reason that you're feeling nipple sensitivity is because your milk ducts in your nipples are opening up, which is why I bought you this nipple kit.
It's from Kernsten's-- the nipple people.
It has nipple cream, nipple pads, and also a special nipple pimple ointment in case you develop any pimples on your nipples.
Oh, my God, you have to stop using the word "nipple".
Okay.
Anyway.
Hopefully that will help you with any sensitivity that may arise around your boob hats.
Larry, get in there!
Come on!
What do--I don't even know what we're doing.
What is the meaning of this, nurse?
Emergency whine & cheese club.
Put your headphones on, Ron.
I have a lot of complaints.
Sit down.
I need to vent.
And do not under any circumstances respond to anything I say.
All right.
Let's talk about vomit, kids.
I do it all day long.
Super fun it feels super good I wanna do it all the time sex is cool Okay, Sex Is Cool.
Got that.
I say we finish on Drunk Off Our Asses.
And I think we should do Sex in Space.
It's 20 minutes long, but it's really good.
Babe, I don't think you should play any of those songs for a group of six-year-olds.
Whoa, wait-- six-year-olds?
Did you book us a gig at a kids' party?
You said we were playing at a festival.
You said Dave Grohl might be there.
Dave Grohl might be there.
I don't know.
He might be anywhere.
The guy's awesome, and he's unpredictable.
No, no, I'm not playing for a bunch of screaming kids.
Mouse Rat is a rock band.
We're not the Wiggles.
Come on!
I'm sick of all the drama with this band.
I-I quit.
I'm going back to rabbinical school.
Umbilical school?
Rivers, come back.
Rivers, don't do this.
Hey!
Shaq might be there!
Hey, did you get a chance to sign off on that booklet I gave you?
Well, I read it, but it seems like your farmers market rules may be specifically targeting chardbodies.
What?
How?
"No visible cleavage.
"No strobe lights.
No chard-related innuendo".
Those apply to all vendors.
Either way, it's too late.
The train has left the station.
Okay, what train, from which station?
- You're revoking my license?
- Oh, boy.
Yes, Nolan, under the auspices of the office of city manager, et cetera, et cetera, it's not important, you are in violation of many rules, and therefore you cannot sell your goods anymore at the Pawnee farmers market.
Ben, back me up on this without hesitation.
Nolan, can I have a second to speak with my w-- with Ms. Knope for a second?
Look, chard is disgusting.
You try selling it without sexy dancers.
It's impossible.
It's like, "Hey, you like lettuce?
"Try this.
It's worse.
It tastes like kale took a dump on spinach".
I like to think of it as celery with B.O.
But if it's so gross, you should just sell something else.
I inherited this farm from my dad.
It's all I have.
Plus, the other vendors want me there.
I'm good for business.
We're not revoking your license.
For now.
I am sorry you had to come in.
Judas!
I don't appreciate being ambushed, Leslie.
- Let's just go home.
- No.
I know what you're trying to do.
If we go home, the firewall is up, and then you don't have to deal with me anymore.
Instead, fellow employee, I will meet you in the basement conference room at 6:00 P.M., and we will solve this chard issue once and for all.
Don't forget your approval pen.
What?
There's no such thing.
Yes, there is.
I made it for you last night.
Ugh, and Lamaze class, wait till I tell you about that Ponzi scheme.
Ugh.
Oh, hey, Donna, what the hell?
You know I can't be around smoke or fatty tuna.
Ron-- At first, this was funny, but it's gotten out of hand.
This was our chance to vent about work, and you've taken it over.
Yeah!
It's sushi and cigar club now.
Wow.
Okay.
I see how it is.
I feel bad.
I don't.
This is a Cuban.
This is yellowtail.
I feel amazing.
Whoa!
Monster in the window!
You know what my biggest complaint is?
I have a million things I need to complain about, and I can't take them home because Chris is the most considerate person in the world, and he just wants to help me, and then I feel bad about that, and then I get annoyed that he wants to help me, and I feel even worse about that!
I thought you guys would be cool with me complaining 'cause it's all you do, is sit here and complain without judgment or guilt.
But you know what?
I guess I was wrong.
And you know what?
I would yell some more, but I think I just peed my pants a little bit.
What's happening now?
Is the nurse upset?
I don't care.
Okay, 6:00.
Let's do this.
Larry?
Mm.
Hey, Leslie.
Ben couldn't make it, so he asked me to read you this.
"Dear honey--" Oh, how sweet.
- Read.
- Oh.
"Sorry, but I think we just need to take a break "from this work issue.
"Please don't grind your teeth too hard "when you hear this.
I will see you in the car.
I love you".
Oh, that is so sweet that you still write love letters to-- What the hell are you doing out here?
Sorry, babe.
I am off city hall property.
You have to stop.
Firewall.
Wrong.
All roads and bridges fall under the purview of the Pawnee department of transportation, which is located on the fourth floor of city hall.
Firewall down.
Stay frosty, Wyatt.
We're just getting started.
Okay, well, that's interesting.
You know why?
- Why?
- Because-- Mother-- Ha-ha!
Bank!
Private property.
Firewall restored!
Ha-ha-ha!
The concrete that you're standing on was poured by a municipal construction crew.
Private fountain, private property.
I'm safe.
Guess where the water comes from.
The Pawnee reservoir.
You can't escape city hall, fool!
Let's dance.
Hey, friends.
I'm just about to go on my night jog.
Would you like to join me?
Mm, hard pass.
We're here because you need to tend to your woman.
She's complaining about everything, ruining whine & cheese club.
I literally have Why is Ron wearing headphones?
What's whine & cheese club?
And what is Ann complaining about?
You, mostly-- how you never let her vent because you're always too busy trying to solve everything for her.
She's upset that I'm trying to help her?
You've fallen into a classic trap, Christopher-- trying to fix a woman's problems instead of just listening to what they are!
Why are you yelling?
Tom put all my records into this rectangle!
Hey, man, if Ann needs Tylenol, she can get it herself.
What she needs from you is to just look her in the eyes, nod your head, and say those two magic words.
"That sucks".
"That sucks"?
I spent my entire life reading instructional books about relationships in order to trick women into liking me.
When Ann tells you what's bothering her, don't try to fix it.
Just say, "Damn, that sucks".
The songs just play one right after the other!
This is an excellent rectangle!
Okay, this is insane.
It is 40 degrees, and we are standing in freezing water.
No, this is our motivation.
We are not leaving this fountain until we've figured this out once and for all.
Fine.
Why are you not supporting me on this?
I thought you agreed with me.
I do, as a person, but as city manager, I'm not 100% sure you have a case.
You're not listening to my side.
I mean, sometimes when we disagree, you're so passionate, I feel like I'm arguing with the sun.
What?
That is totally crazy!
I am super chill all the time!
Look, let's just admit it.
We're in a weird position.
We're married.
Our professional status has flipped, like, five times.
I mean, now I'm your boss.
This is "un-charded" territory for us.
Oh, that's nice.
Thanks.
I learned from the best.
The point is, forget firewalls.
Let's just be respectful and communicate, and we'll find the right balance.
You're right.
I should have considered your side.
I love you, and you're also a very smart person.
Let's get out of this fountain.
I can't because my legs are numb.
Yeah, I can't move.
Are we gonna die here?
Yeah.
No, don't do that.
I don't like this game.
I don't know what the rules are!
Okay, babe, here's what I did.
Tell me if this is appropriate for a kids' song.
I changed the lyrics in Sex Hair to You got sex bears you got 'em from me, kids sex bears big ol' sex bears Andy, the word "hair" was not the problem with Sex Hair.
Oh, it's sex!
Oh, crap.
Now what the hell am I supposed to sing?
It's time, Andrew.
These kids are tearing my house apart, and I need you to calm them with the power of song.
Oh, gosh, here's the thing-- I can't do it.
I got laryngitis.
You will not bail on me, Andrew Dwyer.
You will perform.
My nephew is something of an outcast in his school, and I got Erica Swarvane to come, which is a huge get.
She rules the first grade.
And this party will determine his social status for the next hundred years!
So you better get out there, or I am going to lose it!
Have you not lost it?
Oh, you don't even know!
Babe, I'm freaking out.
Listen to me.
You make up songs all the time off the top of your head.
You do.
You can do this, and afterwards, we can have cake.
I already had cake.
Andy!
Okay, focus up, you little monsters!
Not you, Erica.
You're an angel, and we're thrilled you're here.
Now, is everyone ready to hear the best music you've ever heard in your miserable little lives?
No!
Okay, then, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome-- what even do you call yourself?
- Yeah, I-- - Oh, it's too late!
Please welcome Johnny Karate and his magical guitar stick!
Uh It feels super good it's super fun I wanna do it all the time pick your nose 'Cause boogers are gross clean out your snout You can pick your nose with your smelly toes Ew!
He's doing it!
You're picking your nose, and you put it on your friend!
Ha-ha, I started that.
Great!
Everybody pees the bed just something that we do I for instance peed the bed until I was 32 Ew!
Don't play with matches they're really not safe your parents keep 'em in a drawer with twist ties and batteries My name is Bert Macklin.
I investigate stinky feet for the FBI.
Stinky feet patrol stinky feet patrol Stinky feet patrol!
Stinky feet patrol!
This is so fun.
I cannot believe this only cost me 150 bucks.
Oh, hey.
How was your day?
It was okay.
Now my legs really hurt.
It's like I have a tension headache, but in my calves.
A new surprise every day.
That sucks.
I know.
And I'm so gassy.
There's just been, like, a long, slow fart stream coming out of me since we started talking this morning.
That really sucks.
Yeah.
It does.
Thanks.
I'm sorry that I was trying to fix all your problems.
Oh, God, don't apologize.
I'm sorry I was such a freak.
You're the nicest, most thoughtful baby daddy a girl could ask for.
That was incredible.
You are overflowing with talent, and I admire you.
- Oh.
- Excuse me.
- Mr. Karate?
- Mr. Karate!
My son wants you to sing at his birthday party next weekend.
- Are you available?
- He is, but it's actually $250 for short notice.
You can call this number and ask for April Karate.
Yes, I will.
- Babe - Oh, my God.
That was amazing.
I kind of think you can make a career out of this.
But, I mean, I don't know.
W-what does that make me-- a kids' performer?
I'm supposed to be a rock star.
You just had fun in there and made $150.
Who cares about what you were supposed to be?
- Yeah.
- Plus, you have never been sexier to me than when you were singing to those kids just now.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, that's weird.
Nolan, I'm very sorry that I overreacted and overstepped my bounds.
I understand.
When I got into the chard game, I knew I'd ruffle some feathers.
Sure.
I'm just glad that we could all come to an agreement.
All right, everybody, it is now 5:00 P.M., which means the farmers market is closed.
And farmers market after dark is open for business!
Well, if this is the way people want to buy their produce, so be it.
This town is full of lunatics.
Ugh!
Oh, my God, this was a terrible idea.
Yeah, it's like a tree barfed in my mouth.
Bleh.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
What do you mean, you can't?
Look I am throwing a farewell party for my best friend, Ann Perkins.
And if she casually mentioned 3 years ago that she thought indoor fireworks would be cool then guess what, you're gonna give me indoor fireworks.
Tonight's biggest surprise is 5 years in the making.
It all goes back to when I first met my best friend.
I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street.
I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and it's government-owned and you need to do something about it.
- I will help you.
- Is that a promise?
It's more than a promise.
It's a pinky promise.
That promise launched a friendship so grand it takes 103 scrapbooks to capture it.
I have secretly arranged to officially break ground on Pawnee commons at midnight, fulfilling my pinky promise that I made five years ago.
Oh, ice cream sandwich taste test!
That was our biggest fight.
- Hey, Knope.
- Harold.
You're breaking ground on the Pawnee commons tonight?
Public works never signed off on that.
Look, your office was giving me a hard time, so I had to call in a few favors.
I don't like it when people go over my head.
Understood.
I will make a note of that.
Would you like a treat?
I run that department and I do not appreciate-- - Damn, that's really good.
- Right?
There's gonna be a lot of these at the party.
- You should come by.
- I kno-- I get it.
I know what you're doing.
And I still--is there a little crunch in there?
- Hazelnut.
- Ooh.
Ooh, right?
See you tonight.
Okay, well, let's go set up this party.
April, thank you.
I know you may tease Ann, but deep down inside I can tell that you really care.
Ann's leaving town and saying painful good-byes to loved ones.
Greatest day of my life!
Thank you all so much for helping me with these boxes.
I'm just a little behind because every time I start, I get-- a little emotional.
Hey, that box has my name on it.
Hey, this one has my name on it.
This one has plates' name on it.
You have just found your buddy boxes.
Each box contains a memento of our friendship.
I was gonna give them to you later, but there is no time like the present.
Fun pun alert.
A bronzed hamburger.
It's from our turkey versus beef cook-off, remember?
You were a worthy adversary.
I would have preferred a regular hamburger for eating, but this is very nice.
spreadsheets?
Man, that year was insane!
That was the year you went from being an auditor to a legend.
Whoa!
A picture of me officiating Leslie and Ben's wedding.
And look, you can just about see my head.
Thank you so much.
Snakejuice!
I thought these were destroyed by the FDA.
I did have to go to a very seedy location to find it, but now I know where to go to place a bet on horse fighting.
Okay, don't mention anything about the groundbreaking to Ann.
Repeat that back to me.
Tell Ann about the groundbreaking, frame Ann for murder, release a deadly virus into the water supply.
Good.
Oh!
Bon voyage, Ann.
My God, this is amazing.
That's sparkling cider.
Why is there a New Year's Eve countdown clock and the Easter bunny?
I don't know when we're gonna be able to visit each other, so just to be safe this party is a celebration of every event that's gonna happen this year.
Your birthday, New Year's, Chinese New Year's, flag day.
Ain't no party like a Leslie Knope party 'cause a Leslie Knope party is actually 30 parties.
Knope, you have out-knoped yourself.
Seems like the party's dying down.
Weird.
Ann, you probably wanna head to Michigan forever, so I snuck into your house and packed a bag for you.
Bye.
This is just a bunch of bras and knives.
And loose onions.
Okay, party!
Don't drink!
Have fun!
Hey, so we have a little farewell gift for you.
We all pitched in and got you a gift card from that home store, "Pots and Pans".
We have been on the prowl for some amazing pots.
Well, that card's for three pans.
Either way, this is great.
You know what?
We should get to the good-bye party, although I know it's mostly for Ann.
Yeah, but there's, like, one corner for you and it's just carob cookies and berries.
Carob cookies and berries are literally my favorite dessert alternative.
I'll go get changed.
Man, he put a lot of work into our presents.
I feel kinda bad just getting him a gift card.
I also shook his hand.
Twice.
Anything more than that would be excessive.
Let's all put our heads together and brainstorm.
We gotta send this dude off with the perfect gift.
I say we start with the three "Câs," cashmere, concert tickets, caboodles of cash.
I feel like those are perfect gifts for you.
Those are perfect gifts for anyone.
Ugh, I wish you guys were Donna!
I'm 100% sure that I will not meet another Donna Meagle in Michigan.
I'm gonna miss you.
You know, I'm gonna miss you too, Perkins.
But now that you're officially out of the dating pool, you know I'm gonna run this town, right?
Ooh.
Oh, yeah, you do not wanna go down that road.
Trust me, I tried.
Hi, Stephen.
Hey, Ann.
- Super cute baby bump.
- Thanks.
Good looking out.
Hey, Ron, have you seen April?
I've been mostly focused on these ribs.
By the way, you're out of Easter ham and Thanksgiving turkey.
Great party.
Hey.
Are you on the lot?
Is everything okay?
Uh, not really.
Public works put up a giant padlock on the fence and a sign that says "No trespassing".
That probably doesn't apply to us.
There's also a sign that says "Especially Leslie Knope".
Well, Leslie Knope is a very common name.
There's a professor in Copenhagen named Leslie Knope.
They probably mean him.
Do they mean the professor?
Yeah, there's a picture of you also.
And two huge security guards.
Holy mother of Malia!
And Sasha.
I love them both equally.
Okay, it's that stupid Harold who's behind this.
Get here and we will make a plan.
How long do I have to do this?
Until I say so, Orin!
Stay in character.
Leslie can't watch anything with Julie Andrews in it before bedtime because it gets her too hyper.
Okay.
If Chris gets cranky around noon, just stuff some chia seeds into a fig-- works every time.
Awesome, thank you.
Wow, we really picked some intense people - to spend our lives with, huh?
- Yeah.
Where's Leslie?
I haven't seen her in a while.
Oh, she's just running around trying to pull off an elaborate, thoughtful surprise for you.
- Of course.
- Where's Chris?
I told him that One Headlight By the Wallflowers isn't "dancing" music and he said "Not with that attitude".
Of course.
Dude, Ann, you know what I just remembered?
We used to date.
Yeah, we lived together for two years.
I know, it's crazy, right?
Anyways, you're the best.
Have fun in Mexico.
Harold, it is Leslie Knope again.
I know you are screening my calls, but if you could call me bac-- And his voicemail is full.
Did you have any luck?
Flipped through the bylaws.
I don't think there's anything I can do.
What is the point of being married to a city manager if he can't wield unfettered power to crush my enemies?
Hopefully there are a few other reasons.
- Yeah.
- Looks like we hit a wall.
Oh, God.
April?
Are you okay?
What's happening?
I'm just so scared that this means that Ann won't really leave.
Life, huh?
It's quite a ride.
Yes, Tom, it is.
I got you a going-away present.
I'm deleting you from my phone.
You're finally free of my animal magnetism.
Maybe one day years from now when we're both old and Chris is dead, you'll run into me somewhere.
I'll be opening my latest mega club.
I'll see you there on the street by yourself and I'll tell the bouncer/my bodyguard, "Hey, that woman's way too old to get into this club, but why don't you let her in the back"?
That's very generous.
Stay golden, sweetheart.
I'm gonna miss you too, Tom.
Shh.
And you're kind and you're thoughtful and you're always such a delight to have around.
I am sure you are going to be an incredible mother.
Thanks, Larry.
That's nice.
Good-bye, Ann.
I have enjoyed parts of our time together.
Oh, God, Ron.
That was really something.
Okay, what do we have for Chris?
I got this City of Pawnee mug.
Also, this cool jacket.
No, I think that's Chris's jacket.
Okay, good, then we know he likes it.
Catch up, Larry.
Okay, I found some old receipts from lunches we had together.
Is that anything?
This is my contribution.
It says "Ron".
Hey, guys, what's going on?
Oh, we're just giving you a bunch of cool gifts.
No, God--ohGod.
Get your hopes up, Chris.
Let's see what's in here.
Some assorted items.
Andsome pieces of paper.
Boom, nailed it.
All right.
Now we can start enjoying this party.
Leslie, this is the most incredible event that has ever been thrown.
There is a pilgrim line dancing with a box of candies.
Why do you look so bummed out?
We were planning a surprise groundbreaking at Pawnee commons for you.
You know, an actual beginning to the project that brought us together.
But now we can't do it because Harold is such a jerk face.
He put a barbed wire fence around the lot and now it's not happening.
I'm sorry, Ann.
First of all, don't apologize.
And second of all, screw Harold.
If I learned one thing from Leslie Knope it is we do not take "No" for an answer.
Anything is possible if we work hard enough.
- Let's do it.
- Oh, my God!
Ann Perkins to the rescue.
Okay, hands in, everybody.
One, two, three.
- Groundbreaking!
- Let's go!
Dark forces, arise!
Okay, I didn't plan what we were all gonna say.
That's my bad.
Here we go, Ann.
Let's go.
Okay, knock or ring the bell?
Bust in unannounced.
Love it!
Harold.
What the hell, Knope?
We need the key to the fence that you put up on the Sullivan Street lot.
You snuck around behind my back.
I told you I didn't like that.
Forget it.
Come on, Harold, look.
This is a great opportunity you have right now.
Just think of us as your genies who can give you anything you want.
Nothing gross.
Okay, yeah, there is something I want.
Super fizzy fruity pop.
Sorry?
Sweetums used to stock our office with free sodas as a promotional thing, but that Kathryn Pinewood lady just took 'em away.
If you can get us our free sodas back, I'll get you a key.
- Deal.
- Easy.
It is not easy.
Kathryn Pinewood is the person on earth who hates me the most.
Well, luckily, you're with the person on earth who loves you the most.
- Too cheesy?
- No, it's perfect.
I love you.
Don't leave.
Come on.
Donna, you are a remarkable woman, and I just wanted to say that I've always thought of you as family.
I just wanna say that I've always thought you were hot.
Yes, I know.
April-- Yeah, you saw a lot of potential in me, I'm like a daughter to you, and it was a treat to watch me blossom.
Blah blah blah, bye.
That is remarkably close to what I was going to say.
Also, I'm proud of you.
Donna, are you grabbing my butt?
Can you blame me?
No!
Sorry, can't help you ladies.
I don't have time for disgraced former politicians and unmarried preggos.
Oh, Kathryn, always a delight.
Listen, I know that you and Leslie have had your disagreements in the past, but we really need the key, and we can only get the key if we get the sodas.
Please?
I don't see why I should do you any favors.
I mean, if you were still a city councilor, maybe.
But I seem to remember you were recalled.
Is that right?
- How dare yo-- - Okay, Leslie.
Please.
It's not worth it.
For you.
For me, I don't care.
What the hell?
Yeah, Pinewood, that's right.
I'm pregnant and I have you in a headlock.
And if you try to fight back, I will sue you.
Unless you tell us how to get those sodas right now.
Okay, fine.
Sweetums has been desperately trying to get a local celebrity spokesman to endorse their new sports drink.
So if you can make that happen somehow, they'll give you whatever you want.
Damn, Perkins.
Okay, who does Sweetums want as their spokesperson?
They already tried to get me to endorse that sports drink.
I said "No".
They want me dunking on the label.
When is this town gonna realize that I'm more than a former high school basketball star?
I don't think this new sports drink is even about basketball.
It's called "Sweetums dunktastic three-point B-ball blast" the slogan is "It's all about basketball".
I'm sorry, you're gonna have to find yourself some other famous pawneean.
We know that you were already approached by Sweetums and you said "No," but is there any way you would reconsider?
I'm sorry, Miss Knope.
There is such a thing as journalistic integrity, and it is something that I have as a journalist with integrity.
It's really important, Perd.
Please?
Come on.
For old time's sake.
Well, the story of that appeal is it was heartfelt.
And in response to that appeal, I respond: Okay.
For old time's sake?
Does that mea--no!
- Ann, you tricky minx.
- Yep.
- I went on a date with Perd.
- What?
It was during that "explore my freedom as a single woman" phase.
- Wow.
- We just had a drink.
And at the end he said, "I am going to kiss you now by putting my mouth on your mouth".
And then I ran away.
It was absolutely the right call.
Well, we could just tell him the truth that we feel bad that we didn't get him anything nice.
Tell the truth?
That's hilarious.
No.
We tell him we had the perfect gift, but we were robbed at gunpoint.
"Chris, he had a gun.
He took all the gifts".
Now Chris feels bad, he's buying us gifts.
Next thing you know, Tommy's got a new watch.
Again, I don't see the problem.
I shook the man's hand.
Twice.
Guys, look what I got at the president's day booth.
Ask not what your country can do for you.
From Family Guy, right?
Listen, Chris, we have to tell you something.
We feel bad because you got us such thoughtful gifts and we got you three pans and a bag of nothing.
Guys, I don't need anything from you.
My buddy boxes are about the past, but let's focus on the future.
Because we're always gonna be friends.
And just the fact that you feel bad about your bag of nothing proves that.
To the future.
- Hear, hear.
- To the future.
- To the future.
- Cheers.
- I have an idea.
- Future.
Don't you ladies ever knock?
No.
Okay, so we got Perd Hapley to sign on with Sweetums, which means that you get your sodas back, which means that we get our key.
Okay?
Everything's here in writing.
Now call off your guards.
Okay.
Fine.
You two are a couple of real pains in the ass.
You know that?
Harold, your tiny brain could not understand this, but that is the best compliment you could ever give the two women standing in front of you.
Bye, Harold.
Victory at last.
Whoo!
- All right.
- You're all set.
Okay, I am gonna call the official ceremonial ribbon cutting guy, 'cause I think we may have missed him.
What are you doing?
It's for the raccoons.
You have to hiss really loud and stomp your feet so they'll leave you alone.
And if one comes close, make yourself really large like a puffer fish.
Pawnee raccoons.
That is one thing I will not miss.
Well, Michigan has wolverines.
Maybe they'll eat your toes.
So how long do you think you'll stay in Pawnee for?
I don't know.
We like it here.
I made Andy promise that someday we'll move to Transylvania, but that probably won't happen till we're, like, 100.
Well, for what it's worth, I'm really happy that you and Andy are married.
Why?
Why?
Because I love him and I love you.
Why wouldn't I be happy?
I love you too.
What's that?
I love you too.
I-I couldn't--I couldn't quite hear you.
Please don't make me say it.
Please.
My going-away present to you will be that I do not make you audibly say that you love me.
Thank you.
- What's happening here?
- Okay, Leslie's coming back.
- Get off me, wench!
- Did I miss a nice moment?
- No.
- Yes, you did.
Oh, good.
Guys, what are you doing here?
Come in.
You caught me before my first run of the day.
I call it my "beat the sun" run.
It's a race between me and the sun.
Well, we got one more gift for you.
It's quarter-sawn zebra wood adjoined by floating tenons to the black walnut corner posts.
Finished with a wiping varnish that's a secret Swanson family recipe.
Handmade at my woodshop, and you are correct.
It is gorgeous.
You're starting a new life with your new family, so it's an empty buddy box to fill with memories for your little buddy.
Ortwizzlers.
That's the beautiful thing about a box.
We all burned our initials in, see?
Wait a minute, who's G-J-L-G-G?
That's Garry Jerry Larry Gergich Gengurch.
I burned in all my names.
I really--I didn't know what to do.
Well, um Thank you.
Um, this tear, um, caused by the overwhelming thoughtfulness of my friends will be my baby's first memory.
Salt water will warp the wood.
So keep your tears in your eyes where they belong.
Will do, Ron Swanson.
Can I still call you when I have thoughts on Jennifer Aniston's future?
Not if I call you first.
And can we still be on the phone for every state of the Union address and every Oscar red carpet coverage and every single viewing of Tootsie?
Of course.
Oh, Ann Perkins.
You perfect sunflower.
You totally changed me, you know?
You taught me how to balance my life, - how to be patient.
- Mm - How to be more patient.
- Yeah, that's better.
How to throw bureaucratic caution to the wind when it came to Ben.
But most importantly, you taught me that I can't pull off a tulip skirt.
It's just not your shape.
Well, I don't think this ceremonial ribbon cutting guy is gonna make it.
Either he flaked or he tripped and impaled himself on his own giant scissors.
We wait for no man.
Let's do this.
One, two, three!
All right, I got my park.
That's all I wanted from you.
Friendship over.
Don't even joke about that, Ann.
It was your idea to get me that box.
Ah, it was a group effort.
But it had that trademark Ben Wyatt mix of thoughtful and resourceful.
You are literally the best friend that I will ever have.
You too, man.
Leslie Knope.
Chris Traeger.
I just wanna say that getting to know you and watching you work has been one of the greatest experiences of my life--that and working with Dr. Richard Nygard.
Sure, and I just want you to know that I thought there was no man on earth good enough for Ann Perkins.
- And I still think that.
- Right.
But if there is no one actually good enough for her, you are pretty damn close.
Okay, well, this is normal.
No big deal.
- Drive safe.
- We will.
I packed you some sandwiches and some caffeine free iced tea.
So--oh, and there's a mix CD that I made already loaded in your car.
There's a lot of Sarah McLanahan, so, Chris, I apologize.
Things are gonna get emotional.
I love you.
I love you too.
Breakfast, Knope?
Oh, I don't know.
Come on.
There has never been a sadness that can't be cured by breakfast food.
That's fair.
Someone else is gonna have to drive though.
My eyes are basically useless right now.
I'm on it.
Shotgun!
I called shotgun!
- You're all nailed.
- I call sitting on your lap.
You can't--I--double shotgun!
We call double shotgun!
How come people don't do that more often?
It's illegal.
Raise you hand if you want waffles.
I'm eating waffles.
Bacon and eggs, please and thank you.
You belong somewhere you feel free
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
"Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt were married "one year ago this week at the Pawnee city hall.
"The bride wore a gown made by her friend Ann Perkins.
"And the groom wore a butt so perfect it could make an angel hang itself".
- You wrote this, didn't you?
- I did.
- They cut it way down.
- Thank God.
Okay, so, the big day is tomorrow.
So let's go over this again.
What are the anniversary rules?
At lease 100 kisses.
Dinner at 7:00.
- And no gifts.
- That's right, no gifts.
No gifts.
No gifts.
Oh, I'm getting him a gift.
I always say that I'm not gonna get him a gift.
And Ben always believes me.
And then, bam, I surprise him with the best gift of all time.
He makes the cutest, dopiest face when he's surprised.
It's like Wha-a-a-at?
I'm not gonna make my stupid surprise face this year because this time I got her the most amazing gift ever.
And she'll never see it coming because I'm giving it to her today, one day early.
So she's gonna make the face this year.
She will make that stupid face!

Welcome to Thought For Your Thoughts.
I'm your Pawneean host, Derry Murbles.
And I'm your Eagletonian host, August Clementine.
Yes, if you have not heard our program in a while, Thought For Your Thoughts now has a co-host, thanks to the Pawnee-Eagleton merger I believe that is the Eagleton-Pawnee merger, n'est-ce pas?
I'd like to apologize to our listeners for my co-host's sudden and violent outburst just now.
Our guest is former city councilwoman Leslie Knope.
- Leslie, thought - For your thoughts.
I said it.
Absorb the aggression, Derry.
Absorb the aggression.
Well, I just want to say thank you so much for having me.
It's a thrill to be here.
As a listener, I think the merging of your two shows has really created such a big, quiet, arcane ball of fun.
It's been a couple of months since Pawnee and Eagleton officially merged.
Things are going okay.
There's still a little animosity between the two towns.
I haven't seen Pawneeans this mad since Frankie's discontinued their pizza-stuffed-crust pizza.
It was a pizza whose crust was stuffed with little pizzas.
And the crust of those little pizzas was made of chocolate.
Ms. Knope, I understand you're here today to try to convince us that this disastrous merger of our two towns was, in any way, a good idea.
Yes, there were some bumps and bruises.
And a brief rash of arson.
And a rather large-scale brawl at the dump.
But overall, the state of the merger is very strong.
Scoff.
Did you just say the word "scoff"?
You must admit, Ms. Knope, that the merging of the towns has been fraught with antipathy.
For example, I now have to share my studio with a fatuous twerp who shall remain nameless.
This twerp has a name.
And it's August N'gutu Liebowitz-Clementine.
Guys Hello.
Thank you so much for letting me help plan your anniversary.
It is so wonderful to be part of such a special day.
Okay, remember, under no circumstances can Leslie know about what's going on.
She has to make that face, do you understand?
No, I don't fully, but my lips are sealed.
I asked for Larry's help because he has the most successful marriage of anyone I know, to a gorgeous woman.
Which, honestly, is still a mystery to me.
Like, was it a hypnosis accident or something, where they put Gayle under and made her fall in love with Larry and never said the magic word to snap her out of it?
Like, if I say "nutmeg," will she wake up and start screaming?
What kind of pet are you interested in adopting?
We have dogs, cats, rabbits.
Um, I work here, so, legally, you can adopt me.
The girls want an actual dog.
And they want it to look like this.
Interesting.
So, like a banana made of spiders?
I've said it before and I'll say it again, children are terrible artists.
And artists are crooks.
I think I know a good dog.
There he is!
Ron, how about this guy?
Yes, he is a handsome fellow.
Hello, dog.
I'll take him.
That was easy.
Awesome.
Well, Donna can help you get started on the paperwork.
Donna?
"Why lie?
I'm shopping.
Back in an hour".
Ugh!
God, she's always just leaving and not telling me.
Hello, caller.
You have a comment?
Yeah, ever since the merger, we've had a really bad trash problem.
Well, yes, there has been some confusion with some of the garbage routes.
And the Sanitation Department is stretched a little thin.
No, I mean Eagletonians are human garbage.
And we should throw them in a dumpster.
Kapow!
Yeah, I really like the merger, but I hate that Eagleton was forced to join Pawnee.
Well, that's what the merger is.
Oh.
Yeah, then I hate the merger.
I think the merger was great.
And I think Leslie Knope did an amazing job.
I don't know who this is, but I agree.
- It's Andy!
- Hey.
I'm on the radio!
That's all the time we have on Thought For Your Thoughts.
- I'm Derry Murbles.
- And I'm August Clementine.
And I talked last.
Good day.
Is this land mine still functional?
Partially.
Why?
Because I want to blow up Donna's desk so I can teach her a lesson about what happens when you skip work.
I'm not sure that's how you should go about this.
I'm kind of her boss, now, but I still feel weird disciplining her.
What do I do?
Look her in the eyes and tell her exactly what you need from her.
Be mature, direct, and firm.
What?
Some fool just slammed me on Yelp.
I took Ron's advice.
I very maturely and straightforwardly left anonymous comments about Donna online.
"Stopped by to adopt a dog, "but the employee, Donna Meagle, "was nowhere to be found.
Thanks for nothing, Donna Meagle.
Booooo"!
With five "O"s.
Oh, my God, that sucks.
Just have to work harder, I guess, huh?
This freak thinks he can hide behind some anonymous user name?
I'm about to hunt you down.
Don't be upset, Leslie.
No one listens to the radio.
I wasn't even listening.
I was listening to podcasts.
Podcasts are great.
Radio is boring.
Tom, this merger needs a win something symbolic and bright and happy that will show that there's light at the end of the tunnel.
God, I am so stressed.
Uh, Leslie, may I borrow you for a second?
Something very special to show you.
Now is not the time, Larry.
Please leave.
- I think you - Larry!
What are you still doing here?
Aw, jeez.
Okay.
I just wish Pawnee and Eagleton were as happy as Ben and me.
Yeah, by the way, I was gonna mention, you look really old in this picture.
What?
Andy, this is a picture of us.
This is a picture of an elderly couple.
Rosie and Doug DeMarco.
They've been married for 50 years.
"Rosie Hails from Pawnee, while Doug is originally from the former Eagleton".
Oh, my God, this is perfect.
A Pawnee-Eagleton couple that has been married for 50 years is a perfect symbol of how our towns can get along.
And we are gonna hold them up as an example of Pawnee-Eagleton unity.
Whoo!
I'm getting the epiphany sweats.
Stop where you are and take off your clothes.
It's couples massage.
Ugh.
Where's Leslie?
Oh, well, she seemed kind of stressed out.
And then she yelled at me, and she said she was too busy to come.
And since you had said do not tell her the secret - under any circumstances - Aw, man.
Well, that's a danger of doing things a day early, I guess.
Should I text her and try again?
Why don't you just go ahead and get your massage, and then hopefully we can get her in for the next thing.
Okay.
I have been kind of tense lately.
Just thinking about the new Star Wars sequel.
I'm afraid they're gonna rely too heavily on CGI.
And I'm carrying it all in my shoulders.
Just you?
You paid for a couple.
Well, can't believe I'm saying this, but, uh Larry, would you like to get a couples massage with me?
I would love to.
Are we sure we should do this?
Last time we scared an old person, Larry had a heart attack.
That was awesome.
He farted so much.
Okay, look, obviously, we don't really know these people, so let's keep things fun and positive and celebratory, and merger-y.
Can I help you?
Hello, Mrs. DeMarco, I am Leslie Knope, and we saw your announcement in the newspaper and we would love to treat you and your husband to a very special day.
All right.
How much money did we win?
Oh, no, you didn't win any money, you won something better than money.
A golden anniversary celebration.
So no money.
No, and I'm now just realizing how misleading this giant check it.
- Told you.
- Yes, you did, Tom.
Thank you.
Now is not the time.
We Hey!
Hey!
We'll give you some money.
Okay?
Here, here's some money.
Everybody give 'em money.
I got football cards, and a travel mouthwash.
Wow!
That's great!
Let's get started!
Just give me the IP address of the dude that gave me that cracked-out Yelp review.
Okay, here we go.
The IP address says it came from someone inside city hall.
In this building?
Oh, hell, no.
Well, who cares, really?
It's just some dumb internet person.
Ignore it.
Ignore it?
I'm about to come down on this dude like Thor's hammer Mjolnir.
I'm about to go Mjolnir on his ass!
Speaking of bad reviews Computers are mostly pointless, but that Yelp thing gave me a great idea on how to criticize people and places.
I am composing strongly-worded letters about things I disapprove of, and I am using the internet to get addresses where I can send them.
So far I've written to a vegetable farm, several European ambassadors, a manufacturer of male cologne, and a nonfat frozen yogurt bar.
"Dear frozen yogurt, you are the celery of desserts.
Be ice cream or be nothing.
Zero stars".
Oh, I cannot wait for Leslie to see this surprise.
I am so prepared.
I watched Enchanted three times to get all the details right.
And then another two times, because that movie is amazing.
Oh, it really is.
- Hello?
- Oh, hey, Leslie.
You want to go grab lunch together?
- I'm out front.
Super casual.
- I'm sorry, babe.
I'm not even in my office.
I'm out saving the merger.
Can it wait?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No worries.
Okay, great.
I'll see you at dinner.
I love you.
Oh, boy.
Well, it's not too late to cancel the waffle buffet or the Hilary impersonator, but a lot of these deposits were non-refundable.
Hey, Larry.
You up for a boys' day out in a horse-drawn carriage?
Sure.
What the heck?
Well, thus begins our enchanted adventure.
God, that movie really was amazing.
And you know what doesn't get enough credit in that movie?
- The score.
- Music.
Good sir, tally ho.
God, that from the movie!
That is definitely from the movie.
Okay, you two, head on up there.
We are gonna recreate your wedding photo from 50 years ago.
Okay, let's relive that day.
Only this time could we shave her moustache?
Oh, boy.
I don't know.
I'm kind of worried about putting these two on live TV.
They're sort of grumpy.
Why are we wasting our time with these old people anyway?
They're like the old version of iTunes.
We're like the new version of iTunes, baby.
We're gonna be here forever.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die someday.
Well, let's just hope that deep down these two still love each other.
Hey, no touching.
This is not your birthday.
Now, you see, the trick with paella is to use just enough saffron - to complement the shellfish.
- Okay.
- Oh, man, that is so good.
- Oh, yeah.
Wow, isn't this exciting?
In just a few minutes, you are going to be professing your love on television.
Could I have a glass of water before we go on?
Don't give him any water.
He does this annoying thing where every time he takes a drink of water he goes, "Ah" She does this annoying thing where every time she takes a drink of water she is an old nag.
Ah, the playful banter of a couple on the same team.
That's what this is, right?
All right, let's burn this candle.
Joan, if we could just have a moment.
We need to get ready.
Oh, no, no.
We gotta go.
Yeah, the uppers are kicking in.
Just took some ludes to kind of smooth it out, so I'm right in that sweet spot.
Got about 20 minutes before I either get really tired or really horny, so let's roll.
Dougie, are you sure you want to go on television?
You look like a leather glove got caught in a lawnmower.
Okay, you know what?
I'm going to admit something.
I orchestrated the Pawnee-Eagleton merger, and I was hoping that your marriage could show people that a happy union is possible.
So when you're out there, if you could just, you know, look back over the past and focus on the good times, okay?
Donna, you wanted to see me?
Yes, I did, troll.
What?
You tried to adopt a cat last week and I turned you down, because I thought it was too sad for you to have six cats.
Then you tried to blow up my spot online.
You're fired.
You're not my boss, I work for the city attorney's office.
You're fired.
How much postage does it take to send a letter to Canada?
- Who's it going to?
- Canada.
It says, "Dear Canada, you".
Doug and Rosie DeMarco, Ahh.
Tell us how you first met.
Well, it was 1963, and we met, and it was great.
Isn't love grand?
to bridge the meaningless divide between Pawnee and Eagleton.
Yeah, my show, my questions.
So what is the secret sauce that we should all be putting on our marriage burgers?
Well, we never go to bed angry.
Never, ever would have thought of that.
- Ahh.
- Okay.
I can't do this.
Leslie, you can keep your money.
M-money?
Did you bribe them to be here?
No, I Leslie offered us each - Ah - But it's impossible.
You want to know why we got married?
Bring it.
I had no prospects, and Dougie here had an alcohol problem.
Plus the Cold War was happening, and frankly, we all thought we were gonna die.
Well, I figured I could really tick off my parents by shacking up with some Pawnee trash.
Ya-ta-ta-ta-ta.
Okay.
We all agree that marriages have their ups and downs, but at the end of the day, they're worth it because Who likes tap dancing?
I slept with Sharon in 1979.
I used to get out of the shower in front of your brother on purpose.
Hey, Leslie, who cares?
They're old people.
They eat, they sleep, they complain, and they watch Family Feud.
Oh, my God, I wanna be an old person.
Gah, I don't know what to do.
I wish Ben was here.
What is he doing right now?
Oh, man!
- You did good!
- Larry!
Whoa!
Wow.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I own Lettuce Eat, the vegan restaurant on Lowell Drive, and I wanted to know why you nailed this letter to my door.
"Veganism is the sad result "of a morally corrupt mind.
Reconsider your life".
Because I believe it.
Good day.
Carnivores.
You're all the same.
How did that guy know where to find you?
I assume he saw my name and address at the bottom of the letter I nailed to his door.
- You signed your real name?
- Of course I did.
What's gonna happen?
A vegan is gonna physically attack me?
They're basically made of glass.
But more importantly, if you believe in something, you sign your name to it.
Which is why the makers of carbonated water will soon know exactly where to find me.
Donna, Kyle did not write those things, okay?
I did.
- I know.
- You do?
I checked what else that user had written.
It was a review of a funeral home that said "Great first date spot".
I dragged Kyle in here to see if you would come clean.
Well, you overestimated how much I care what happens to Kyle.
Or anyone, really.
But I'm sorry that I didn't just talk to you.
And I'm sorry I bailed on work.
And I'm sorry I toyed with you instead of coming at you straight.
From now on, we say what we feel.
- Cool?
- Cool.
Your lipstick looks weird.
You're gonna want to shut your mouth right now.
Good talk.
I don't know.
Maybe Pawneeans and Eagletonians aren't meant to coexist.
Well, at least our merger is going well.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
You know, Andy and Tom were right when they said the DeMarcos don't matter.
Their generation's the past.
The way to make this merger take hold is to focus on the future.
Of course.
The children.
The children are our future.
Whitney Houston knew it, and so do you, and so do I. I'm gonna need your help on something.
- I think we should go to work - Oh.
But not now.
We're having dinner.
Damn, this paella is good.
Did you put saffron in here?
It makes the shellfish taste delicious.
Yes.
Yes, it does.
Okay, the people in this room are the first members of the Pawnee-Eagleton Youth Committee.
Now, April says that young people think the word "committee" is lame, so let's just think of this as a like a super chill, fun e-hangout.
Worse.
That's worse.
Okay, new people.
Let's introduce ourselves.
Craig Middlebrooks.
Samantha in the boardroom, Miranda in the bedroom.
I know it's not ideal, but it's who I am.
This is my friend Madison.
She's amazing.
And she drove me here!
Okay.
This group has an incredibly important job.
You need to figure out how to hold this town together.
You are going to meet twice a week and you're here because of your energy, and your youth, and for some of you, your mental age, and you're going to find a way to make this merger stick.
So we are gonna order you some 'zzas.
You get to B.S.-ing, brainstorming.
Just chill.
Peace out.
Okay, so it's been an hour.
From out there, it looks like you guys were having some fun, getting to know each other.
So why don't we call this first meeting a success and then we'll get together later in the week.
Hold up, sweet pea.
We have an idea.
It's called the Unity Concert.
It's a massive music and arts festival to celebrate the merger.
We get artists and musicians from both towns to come together.
It's gonna be like a giant Woodstock, except for instead of everybody rolling around in mud, they'll be rolling around in happiness.
Or maybe mud.
I don't know.
I can't control the weather.
We want to have a bunch of different band stages.
You know, people will go to parts of the town they don't usually go to.
Plus, we'll have tents for art exhibits and panels, and maybe a short film festival.
Donna said she might be able to get Ginuwine.
That's given me a reason to live.
Yeah, it's not like everyone's gonna suddenly start holding hands and making out, but we figure, why not throw a big three-day outdoor party, show everyone a good time, and maybe they'll forget about this stupid stuff.
What do you think?
I don't I don't I don't even You know what I mean?
What's wrong with her?
Why is making those noises?
Oh, right, you don't know Leslie.
That means she loves it so much she can't speak.
You guys, that's like I don't know Amazing.
Like what you do there.
Happy anniversary.
So I know we agreed on no gifts.
- What?
- But I did get you a gift.
- No.
- A bunch of them, actually.
I was gonna surprise you with them yesterday, but they never reached you.
Ahem.
Oh, my eff-ing God.
You planned all of this for me?
An enchanted carriage?
This is amazing.
Oh, and your scrapbook instincts are really good.
I mean, this is a little rough, but you have a lot of talent here.
Oh, I can't believe I actually defeated Leslie Knope at a gift exchange.
- Yes!
- Uh, yeah.
About that.
Happy anniversary.
It's the Iron Throne.
Ohh!
It's the Iron Throne.
Yes, it is.
I had a guy at the model store make a replica.
He's a bigger Game of Thrones fan than you are.
Okay, I know I'm making that dumb surprise face, but I can't help it.
This is the greatest gift I've ever received, Leslie.
When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
No!
Come here.
Come hither, peasant.
Come here.
Who are you?
Our starship is in trouble.
Okay, Leslie, listen.
If you're not if you don't know what you're talking about
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Okay, Ron.
Enough's enough.
Let's talk plans for Diane's baby shower.
- Dear God, woman.
- Three main activities-- baby bingo, baby food tasting, and my personal favorite-- baby onesie decorating station.
I'm gonna make mine look like an astronaut.
What are you doing up there in space, baby?
Ah!
So cute!
Okay.
I have some gift ideas.
I was looking at a very adorable stroller.
We already have a stroller.
Oh, shoot.
Really?
I'm gonna have to think of something else.
Oh, my God, whose baby is that?
That would be mine.
Guys, get in here!
Ron has a baby!
- Oh, Ron, cool baby.
- Thank you, Andrew.
Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to my son, John middle name redacted Swanson.
John was born some time ago, weighing multiple pounds and several ounces.
Much like his father, he is a fan of silence.
Please keep your voices down.
How am I supposed to keep my voice down when you had your baby, and you didn't tell me that you had your baby?
Why would you need to know something like that?
Why would I-- oh, my God.
I have not even sent Diane a gift.
She's just walking around, wondering why I haven't sent her a gift yet.
Should we do something?
Just let her tire herself out.
If you need anything from us, Ron, please just let us know.
Actually there is something.
Could one of you please stop by the pet store and pick up some fish food for me?
When did you get a fish?
Okay, youth committee.
Update on the unity concert.
Madison.
So far, 12 bands have said yes.
And we asked them all to submit a song for the new town anthem contest.
I think we should book Orin as a headliner.
I think it's a no-brainer.
Um, he dislocates his shoulder to the music of Billy Joel.
The Pawnee Journal called it, "Why would anyone do this"?
Stop suggesting Orin.
Craig, any update on the art tents?
signed up to show their work.
It was going to be 15, but then this one guy described himself as "Jackson Pollock-esque" and I told him that's finger painting for adults and I hate it!
The Pawnee-Eagleton merger has made for a rough year, both for me and for the town.
But if I can pull off this unity concert and prove that this merger was a success, Pawnee might once again tolerate-slash-ignore me.
I know that sounds bad, but for a politician it's pretty much the best-case scenario.
You guys might as well be a pile of leaves because you're about to get blown away.
I have booked a meeting with none other than Grant Larson.
- No one knows who that is?
- Um, I do.
"Grant Larson," otherwise known as Elton John.
Congratulations, Leslie.
No, Grant Larson is the director of the Midwest branch of the National Park Service.
He's basically the Liam Bonneville of the Midwest.
Liam Bonneville?
The department of the interior's resident bad boy?
He's basically the Tim Dweck-- Okay, never mind.
I have asked Grant to declare Eagleton Hills a national park as the grand finale of our unity concert.
Great idea, Leslie.
And with that update, the Pawnee new founder's day unity concert is now officially ahead of schedule!
And that banner unfurling marks the 100th time that one of my projects has been ahead of schedule.
This is your chance to put your names on the Pawnee unity concert, the biggest event of 2014 besides the unveiling of Tricia's new highlights.
You think I wouldn't notice?
You look fly as hell, girl!
This unity concert needs corporate sponsorship, so Ben and I are meeting with local bigwigs.
I'm gonna do what I do best-- lock down deals.
And dork-asaurus over here is gonna handle the boring stuff.
You said you genuinely valued my business acumen.
Also, I'm your boss.
Oh, my God, he's so cute.
You're the cutest little boo-bear I've ever seen.
You are the world's most adorable baby and I love you!
You are so freaking precious!
Look what Gayle made for the baby.
It says "Property of Pawnee government".
Isn't that adorable?
Come on, John.
Jeez.
Here we are the park that borders Pawnee and Eagleton.
This is the perfect place for the press conference to announce our unity concert.
People are gonna clap, they're gonna cheer.
Today might be the day that I finally crowd surf.
I should probably empty my pockets just in case.
Hey, one question.
Um, where do you think you're gonna stand, in front of the graffiti that says "Pawnee, you suck," or "Go home, Eagleton snobs"?
I painted over that graffiti a week ago.
These people are the worst!
I cannot announce a unity concert in front of a picture of a bald eagle giving the middle finger.
Yeah, you probably wanna stand to the side so people can see it.
You know, why do we even have this wall?
We're supposed to be uniting the two towns, and this literally divides them.
We should just knock it down.
On it, boss.
Ahh!
Ow.
The kool-aid guy makes it look so easy.
In the time I've worked here, I've taken great pains to see as little of this building as possible.
Turns out the third floor is silent, empty, and completely free of government work.
I can't think of anything more beautiful to share with my son.
If I had a toolbox I could take care of that faulty radiator.
Ooh!
This place is a paradise!
Nicely done, Tom.
We have 15 sponsorship offers.
Make that 16.
Mitch Savner.
- Savner Bleaches and Chemicals!
- That's it.
You guys make my favorite teeth-whitening strips-- pearlies for girlies.
It's unisex.
The cartoon princess on the label says so.
I'll sponsor your concert.
But I'm also looking to invest in other ventures.
I have a feeling a bright guy like you has some ideas of his own.
I may have a few eggs ready to hatch in the personal idea nest.
Why don't you come to my office tomorrow and pitch me your hottest idea?
Perfect!
I'll see you then.
Oh, that's pretty cool.
It's all happening, Ben.
Soon I'll have a new career, new crib, new friends.
If all goes well, this may be one of the last times I ever have to speak to you.
Come with me, I need your help.
Thank you so much, everyone, for coming.
And a special thank you to the city council for their support.
I was told there'd be a free barbecue buffet?
Just take some beef jerky andhush!
This spring we will be holding a massive unity concert to commemorate the merger between Pawnee and Eagleton.
This three-day music and arts festival will end on a day we will call "New Founder's Day," an official beginning to our new town.
A few years ago, Eagleton put up this wall along the border.
Now it is time to tear down this wall.
In the name of unity, I have given some former Eagletonians the first strike.
Take it away, guys.
This is such a great day for-- Bees!
Bees!
Oh!
Nobody panic!
Ohhh, noooo!
Ah!
It stung me in the eyeball!
Oh, man, this is amazing, man.
The stupid Eagletonians are totally getting the pwned by these bees.
I'm gonna send this straight to tosh.
Ow, !
!
Don't worry, babe, I'll protect you.
I got stung once, I'm immune.
Go ahead and sting me, bees.
It does nothing.
Leslie, it appears that most of the people that were stung were from Eagleton.
How did you pull that off?
I didn't pull anything off.
The Eagletonians were simply closest to the wall.
Plus, one Pawneean was stung in his mouth because he was laughing at the Eagletonians.
How did you get your bees into the wall, and how long did it take to plan this hilarious bee prank on Eagleton?
They were not my bees, Trodd.
And for the last time this was not a prank.
I did not know that bees were in that wall.
I mean, in fact you should treat this like a public service announcement.
Everybodyshould check their walls for bees.
Nice try, prank queen.
Probably bees in there.
Okay, that's all the time I have.
What else can you do with your bees?
Leslie, what's your next prank?
Ooh.
Leslie, Grant Larson is on the phone from the National Park Service.
I cannot meet with him right now.
We are in crisis mode, okay?
Larry, just tell him I need to reschedule because I am trying to fix my bee hole disaster.
- Okeydokey.
- Wait!
No, wait!
No!
Larry, don't tell him that.
Don't mention my bee hole.
Just as we suspected, John.
We repaired the valve stem seal, and now all that remains is to tighten down this packing nut.
Andthat should do it.
Can we help you?
No.
We have everything under control.
My crew's redoing this whole floor.
We're the only people allowed up here right now.
Well, proceed with your work.
You won't notice us at all.
We're gonna be kinda loud.
My son is several weeks old.
He's quite familiar with the sound of power tools.
Okay, how about this one-- Lasik for fingernails?
Cut your fingernails once, never have to cut 'em again.
All we need is a complicated laser I have no idea how to build.
- Seems impossible.
- All right.
Uh-oh!
"Saltweens"!
Saltines for tweens.
Seemsunnecessary?
The only business idea I have that's even remotely fleshed out is a restaurant.
No way.
Restaurants were ranked number one in Accounting Magazine's "Riskiest Businesses" issue.
That was their last issue before they folded, actually.
Magazines are also very risky.
I can't believe an angel investor floated down from the heavens, and I don't even have anything to pitch him.
Come on, you must've had one good business idea.
You're 52 years old!
No, I'm not.
But I do have an idea.
It's air-tight.
But I have to warn you, it's not super sexy.
- What is it?
- Okay, listen up.
You would be the middleman between dry cleaners and the companies that sell chemicals to dry cleaners.
- Wow!
- Right?
You're right, man.
That is not sexy.
Leslie Knope's little stunt put three people in the hospital.
This bee incident is just the latest assault coming from the Pawnee side of this merger.
Mike Patterson is Eagleton's most tenacious reporter.
When he sinks his teeth into something, he's like a dog with a bone!
Oh, my God!
You can't lean in to whisper and then yell.
That's not fair.
This merger is so fragile, everyone is on edge, and no one is talking about the unity concert.
Why would anybody think that was a prank?
So sad.
People will believe anything.
It was a prank though, right?
No more press, okay?
You just have to lay low for a while.
I promise it'll all blow over.
April, your competence and your levelheadedness is very moving to me, and I will follow your advice right after I go to the hospital and apologize to every victim in person.
- Fine, but no cameras.
- Fine, I won't bring any.
Aghh!
I can't handle all this fighting.
It's like Thanksgiving 2004 all over again!
Don't even ask!
Somebody follow me, I'm distraught!
Who's a big guy?
Man, forget about working.
I just wanna stare at this baby all day.
What is the nature of your work on this floor?
Total redo--new floors, fixtures, plumbing.
How long will it take?
Six to eight weeks.
Deal.
I will do all this work for you in the time allotted.
Just have your tools and materials brought up here.
Are you crazy?
This is enough work for a whole crew.
I'm sure the government believed you when you told them that, and I tip my cap to you for profiting off their ignoe.
But I'm offering you two months paid vacation and the ability to take credit for my work, which will be flawless.
Okay.
Guys, let's go!
I got all help I'll need right here.
Okay, this is the really exciting part.
We buy tetrachloroethylene at $1.60 a gallon, but we sell it back at 2.38 a gallon.
Now I know what you're thinking.
What if it's a cleaner who wants to buy glycol ethers?
Ben, stop!
This is so boring!
This is like listening to a TED talk by the color beige.
Look, I know this idea doesn't excite you.
But I promise it'll make you a lot of money.
Well, I sold tons of awesome stuff.
Guess it makes sense my next challenge is to sell something mind-numbingly dull.
Dull?
Does this look dull to you?
Ahhhh.
I'm so incredibly sorry.
That's very kind of you, Ms. Knope.
I hope you look a lot less gross very soon.
Hey!
Thanks for coming, Knope.
I knew we were besties.
What do you got in there for me, some dirty mags?
No!
These gift baskets are for innocent victims not for jerks who got stung because they were laughing at other people's pain.
Whatever.
Got a lotta filth in my kindle anyway.
We can just hang.
- Wanna come up?
- What?
- We gotta get this.
- Roll camera.
Tell me when.
Is my hair okay?
We good?
Welcome to Eagleton Now, with Mike Patterson.
We're live ambushing Leslie Knope who's in the middle of a crass publicity stunt, shoving cameras cameras into the faces of these poor, injured victims.
These are your cameras.
This is not a publicity stunt.
I just came here by myself to apologize to all the Eagletonians who got stung.
Really?
Because all we see is you talking to your friend, known Eagleton hater Jeremy Jamm.
Excuse me, Mike.
That's, uh, best friend.
Pawneeans and Eagletonians need to find a way to come together and bury the hatchet.
It doesn't matter who bailed out who, or who seceded from you.
Awesome idea, Lezzie.
As a matter of fact I say we should secede from Eagleton!
Whose dumbass idea was it for them to merge anyway?
Mine.
It was my idea.
You heard it here first.
Self-proclaimed dumbass Leslie Knope and councilman Jeremy Jamm are spearheading a Pawnee secession movement.
And I, for one, am sick of it.
All right, you know what, Eagleton, enough!
Get these cameras outta here!
Don't touch my camera, you Pawnee animal!
Name-calling, huh?
Classy move, douche bag.
Oh!
All right.
Is that how you wanna play?
- Yeah!
Come on!
- No fighting in a hospital.
There shouldn't be fighting in a hospital!
Wish I had my ninja stars!
Oh, my God!
What's happening?
Oh!
Motherpuncher!
Hey, girl.
What up?
What are you wearing?
It's to distract people from my black eye.
See?
It's working.
Cool.
Um well, there is some good news.
That Mike Patterson guy's show just aired, everyone is angry, and Jamm is introducing a secession bill at the next city council meeting.
- How is any of that good news?
- It's not.
I just wanted you to have a brief moment of happiness before you got sadder.
Those jerks that hate the merger are a minority.
They're just shouting louder than everyone else.
I'm sorry this town keeps being stupid and letting you down.
It sucks.
It's okay, April.
It's fine.
You know, it's a challenge.
It's just like a big, fun stinking turd nugget.
It sucks.
You're right, everything sucks.
Everything I try with this merger backfires.
I wonder what other excellent surprise lies in store for Leslie Knope.
Leslie, Grant Larson from the National Park Service is here for your meeting.
Excellent.
Now I shall meet with a very important person whilst sporting a gruesome shiner.
Hey, you're also wearing a tie-dye t-shirt.
Oh, yes!
I am!
Wonderful!
Mitch!
Thanks for meeting me.
My pleasure.
It's not often that I see someone with your sparkle and passion.
That's what makes businesses work-- passion!
So, Mr. Haverford, let's get to it.
What idea are you passionate about?
I've got two words for you-- "Tom's Bistro," an old-fashioned, old-world Italian restaurant.
Classy, authentic ambience in a small-town setting.
Why does that say "dry cleaning chemical transactional holding company"?
Ben!
You brought the wrong easel.
God!
Can't take this guy anywhere.
Let me paint you a picture.
Oh, Mr. Larson, I'm sorry.
I had to reschedule.
It's been kind of a hectic week.
- What happened to your face?
- It doesn't matter.
I would like to apply to turn some of our new land into a national park.
I read your request, Ms. Knope, and I'm sorry, but we can't make that happen.
Great.
Well, this week just keeps getting better and better.
Thank you for coming by and plunging a dagger into my already-bleeding corpse.
I came here because I wanted to meet you.
I've actually wanted to meet you since before you called me.
- Really?
You know who I am?
- Yes.
You're the person who wrote this.
You read my proposal to clean up the Pawnee river?
I wrote this two years ago.
Got shuffled around in interior for a year and half.
Liam Bonneville actually used it to humiliate staffers, but he's kind of a bad boy.
Liam B-- - You don't have to tell me!
- This report is legendary.
It's easily the most thoroughly research and passionate grant request I've ever seen.
Wow, you have no idea how meaningful it is to hear you say that.
But you're a little late.
The river cleanup's well underway.
This is bigger than the river cleanup.
We're opening a new office in Chicago.
I spent the last few weeks reading about you and your career and I think that you're the perfect person to run it.
Leslie, would you like to run a branch of the National Park Service?
Tom's Bistro will have all the classic elements, but with modern twists-- an oak bar, live music, and Sunday brunch with scrambled eggs so fluffy they'll be like little pillows for your bacon.
Bacon pillows.
I like the sound of that.
But I have to say, restaurants are incredibly risky.
Most of them are dead on arrival.
We're well-aware of that, but believe me, Tom has thought this out.
See, there's plenty of real estate available in the old Eagleton part of town.
And with the recent closures, there's massive demand for affordable dining that feels high-end.
Okay!
As long as you're running, I'm in.
Amazing!
Hey, kid your boss here sure knows his stuff.
Ron.
What are you doing here?
The most important government work I've ever done-- sanding rat urine stains out of this floor.
What are you doing here?
I come here to think sometimes.
By myself.
- But now that you're here - Damn it.
I am going to speak to you very vaguely about a problem that I have, and you cannot ask me any questions or details about it.
That is my ideal conversation, aside from no conversation.
But that feels unlikely.
Look, you know how much I love Pawnee.
But the more I try to fix it the more people fight me.
They call me names, they recall me, they try to kill the merger.
They literally punch me in the face.
And yet every time I contemplate leaving, just walking away once and for all, I just can't do it.
What is wrong with me?
Yesterday, I fixed that old steam radiator.
Threaded a new valve into the side, removed the handle from the base, unscrewed the packing nut from the stem.
This subpar toolbox only had one wrench, so I was lucky it was a three-quarters or I'd have been screwed.
Yeah, man, you are lucky.
Come on, Ron.
What the hell?
I need your help.
By the time I was done, this 100-year-old piece of American-made cast iron was singing like a bird.
Nowto most people, this story would seem boring.
That's ridiculous.
It's a story about a radiator.
But to me, it was immensely satisfying because I enjoy fixing radiators.
You like fixing this town, Leslie, you always have.
You know it's an uphill battle, but you love the struggle.
I would also add that you've already done a hell of a lot to make this town better, and people like this young man here will benefit from your hard work.
- He is a beautiful boy.
- He's quite a looker.
Thank you, Ron.
- What's that?
- Nothing.
Clearing my throat.
I've been thinking about your offer.
And I have to say I can't think of one single reason not to take it.
That's great!
I'll start drawing up the paperwork.
I'm sorry, I meant because I can think of a lot of reasons not to take it.
Okay, wow, that's very misleading phraseology.
I'm sorry.
It's an amazing offer and I'm very interested, but if I'm going to leave Pawnee I need to know it's gonna be okay without me.
And I won't know until I finish what I've started.
When do you need your answer?
Well, the gears of federal government grind pretty slowly, so you have a little time.
But we can't wait forever.
I'll be in touch.
Great.
Thank you.
That's not your hand.
Here it is.
Sorry, my depth perception is totally screwed up.
Really happy that worked out for you, Tom, but you kinda sold me out back there.
I know, and I'm sorry.
But Mitch asked me what I was passionate about, and honestly I'm never gonna be passionate about dry cleaning chemicals.
To each his own, I guess.
I know opening a restaurant is risky, but I can make this work.
I know I can!
Then count me in as the second investor in Tom's Bistro.
Thanks, man.
I know this is a symbolic gesture, but my investor floor is $1,000.
So as of now, you own zero shares.
Cool!
Thanks for clearing that up.
Now go do work, or I will fire you.
I'm not kidding.
Yep!
Oh, look, John.
It's red pine.
They were gonna put flecked linoleum over this beautifully preserved knotty red pine.
Most people in this world, John, are ass.
This is the best day I've ever spent in a government building, and luckily my son was here to share it with me.
He now has that satisfied look that only comes with the pride of labor.
Or he pooped.
Either way, well done, John.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Okay, I don't want to over-hype this, but presenting Dun-da-da-dah!
the new city of Pawnee website!
Totally revamped!
You can pay parking tickets, you can apply for a business license and the best part is we're going to put up an online poll so people can pick the new town slogan!
Hey, look a panda!
Yeah, that's just some mascot thing that the designer put up on the front page.
But more importantly, you can now apply for a utility tax refundonline!
Wait, the panda's name is Peebo.
Peebo.
Look, you can even play ping-pong.
- What?
- I want to play!
No, me first!
Me first!
That's it.
I'm calling it.
Guys, Ben worked really hard on this, okay?
Let's look at the online polls.
It's gonna be a cool way to choose our new town's slogan.
Oh!
The panda holds a paddle with his tail.
I want to play!
Congratulations, Ben.
This is truly a fine panda game you made.
Well done.
What else does he do?
I think if you click on the bamboo, it puts on a top hat.
What?
I love you, Ben!
What's wrong with you?
You look like Meryl Streep at the end of Ironweed.
You wish.
Well, I've been driving all over Indiana looking for bands to play the unity concert.
I got nothing to show for, except for four car accidents.
All these strangers' insurance information.
Ooh, I get it, you have car insurance.
Why don't you brag about it?
Hey, you are from Eagleton, right?
Are there any places out there I should check out?
I used to go see live shows at Patterson's.
But I'm boycotting until the owner apologizes for what she said to me at the dog park.
Cool.
Anything else?
I hear Cozy's Bar is pretty packed on Thursdays.
But I've never been because it's mostly middle-aged women and I'm allergic to turkey neck.
Really?
That's the best part.
We should split a turkey sometime.
Oh, Mr. Larson.
Thank you so much for meeting me here.
Happy to.
I was in the area.
The chance for me to return your binder full of questions about the job.
I think I answered all of them.
Thank you.
I cannot wait to check this out.
Now, the reason why I asked you to meet me here-- More questions about the job.
Oh, yeah.
Martha?
I'm gonna need two hours worth of waffles.
Grant Larson has offered me a chance to oversee a branch office of the national park service.
This is like the parks equivalent of Bruce Springsteen pulling Courtney Cox onstage.
I mean, one minute you're just a regular girl in the crowd, and the next minute you're dancing 10 feet away from freakin' Max Weinberg!
Okay, my fortieth and eighteenth from last question is about the Heartland Exotic Plant Management Project.
Now, were would I be actually doing the physical planting?
Because it is always been a dream of mine to plant spotted jewelweed along the red river bank in Arkansas, but I'm sure you hear that a lot.
Well, you wouldn't actually be planting things.
I mean, you're overseeing The everyday minutia you would delegate to staff.
Leslie, your job is more creative, big picture stuff.
No more boring people working for you.
Good!
I hate paperwork.
I hardly ever do it in my bed on a Saturday night while listening to old spice girls CDs.
Regal Meagle.
My favorite realtor.
You got some hot properties to show me?
You know it.
Remember my list of must-haves: Open kitchen, fireplace, exposed brick, and you know I wouldn't kick a skylight out of bed.
I'm opening Pawnee's first authentic Sinatra style Italian restaurant-- "Tom's Bistro".
I'm kind of like a skinny, handsome, Indian Mario Batali-- who doesn't know how to cook.
Before we go, I got you guys a little something for helping me out.
Oh!
Love it!
A Larry voodoo doll?
Tom, that's so sweet.
Thanks.
Ow!
Oh, my gosh!
I didn't even do anything.
The voodoo doll is reading my thoughts.
So it seems like it went really well, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, totally.
Grant is great, the job is great.
- The waffles were great.
- Great.
So we're just about ready to go live with the slogan poll.
You want to see?
Now that Eagleton and Pawnee have merged, it is time to pick a new town slogan.
And a slogan can make a big difference with tourism in a town's identity.
There is New York, the city that never sleeps.
And then there is Glenwater, Florida, home of America's most violent Walmart parking lot.
Okay, so people can vote now.
Yeah, see, that's the super cool thing about this website is it does all the work for us so we can just sit back and take it easy.
No.
No, we're not gonna do that.
We're gonna sit forward and take it hard.
- Um, what?
- There's a lot of nitty-gritty left to do, Ben.
We need to roll up our sleeves, we need to go door to door, we need to hand out fliers, and canvass.
You know what we should do?
We should have a press junket, to publicize the poll.
Okay, I hope you had lunch plans, 'cause now you get to cancel them.
Well, I-I did.
So this was one of Eagleton's top sushi restaurants.
But you can't out-run the whale meat police forever.
This is great.
I love it!
Look at it, I can picture it now.
That's where the politicians will sit, this is where the connected guys will bring their goomahs.
This place is perfect.
- How much?
- 9,000 a month.
What?
That's way more that I can afford.
Whatever.
It's not that great.
Plus, it's really far away from work and that'd be annoying.
It's not a big deal.
I mean, when it first launches I'll go back and forth, but hopefully it takes off and it'll become a full-time job.
Come on, I'll show some places in your price range.
This press junket is a brilliant idea, isn't it?
Mr. Strange Cameraman Who I Never Met.
Leslie, I told you, I'm not gonna participate in your weird Julia Roberts, cameraman husband fantasy.
Quiet, cameraman, Perd's here.
Leslie, your poll is designed to choose a new slogan.
And a slogan is a series of words that have a meaning.
So true, Perd.
All of the choices for the town slogan are wonderful, but if I had to choose my favorite it would probably be "Storied past, bright future".
Well, the story of my interest level is: It's medium.
Joan, this poll is a chance to give our newly-merged city a new identity-- to really rebrand this town.
Yes, great question.
I have been thinking of rebranding myself.
What do you think about Juan Callamezzo?
Isn't "Juan" a man's name?
No, it means "flower".
I think it means "John".
Crazy Ira and the Douche from 93.7 FM, the Groove.
Leslie, do you believe that this new slogan will integrate Pawnee and Eagleton into one cohesive city?
Wow, that's a very thoughtful question, Crazy Ira.
Yes, yes, I do.
Follow-up question, Leslie, show us your boobs!
Will this fit on a bumper sticker?
Gosh, this place is packed.
You folks must really like this guy.
Honey, he is sex on a stick.
Ladies and gentlemen, put your jazzy hands together for my man, Mr. Duke Silver!
A smooth and silky evening to you all.
On nights like this, when the cold winds blow, and the air is awash in the swirling eddies of our dreams, come with me and find safe haven in a warm bathtub full of my jazz.
Uh!
Well, the good news is your poll was a big hit.
Thousands of people voted.
That's great.
What's leading?
- "Storied past, bright future"?
- No.
The current leader is "Pawnee, welcome to Douche nation".
- What?
- Crazy Ira and the Douche got their bonehead radio fans to flood the poll with write-in votes.
Why did we include a write-in option?
Because every election has a write-in option.
That's how democracy works.
I'm not a dictator.
If I we're a dictator, I would throw the Douche in prison without a trial.
I would be a very strong dictator, and you would be my bodyguard, and you would lead my army.
Okay, I know we should figure out how to fix this.
But I'm starting to get kind of turned on imagining you as a dictator, is that bad?
No, it's okay.
You know, we could just figure out a different strategy for picking a slogan.
You don't have to go on their show.
No, I want to do this.
I enjoy the challenge.
So, how do I look?
I need these guys to think that I'm, like, super chill.
Is this gonna work?
Oh, what up, Lez?
Backwards hat--shows a real lack of respect for authority.
I like that.
What's up, little mayor?
Are you gonna freak out again?
So, Leslie, what's the deal?
Are you just here to yell at us again?
Yeah, we are in store for another Leslie Knope nag sesh?
Crazy Ira, do the dishes!
Classic!
No way!
I'm not here to nag, guys.
I'm just psyched to be in the studio, you know?
I'm justchillin' in the studes with my dudes.
If you're really not really here to nag us, then maybe you'll help us with our next segment "Rating celebrities' boobs"!
Perfect.
On a scale, from 1 to ga-ga-ga-going!
How would you rate Emma Watson's boobs?
First of all, I would rate her acting as an "A".
You have three seconds to answer or we're gonna withdraw - a donation from charity.
- From charity?
Oh.
A minus.
More like double D minus.
Me so horny!
I knew it.
I knew it.
- Can I help you?
- Maybe.
I was out at the jazz club last night-- scouting bands for the unity concert.
And I saw something very interesting.
- I am Duke Silver.
- I have a twin brother.
What?
- I have a twin brother.
- You are Duke Silver?
Yes, I am Duke Silver.
The only other people who know are Tom and April.
So, please, keep it to yourself.
Are you kidding me?
You are really good!
You are, like, the saxophone player for the California-raisins-good.
No joke.
You know what?
I'm booking you for the unity concert.
Absolutely not.
My musical career is private.
If my secret got out, this office would be waist-deep in women's undergarments.
No, I'm in charge of booking the bands for the concert, and I say, you're in.
You're gonna play right after Bobby knight ranger.
It's a night ranger cover band where they only wear read sweaters.
It's gonna be epic!
Final round, Leslie, boobs or ass?
Hard to believe this is a fan game for your radio listeners.
AhI'm gonna say butt.
Ding, ding, ding!
- Yes!
- You are correct.
This is my mom's dumper!
Oh, mommy!
I don't know how you got yours hand on that.
I took it.
Good.
Well, it is been so fun bro-ing out with my dogs.
I never knew that objectifying women could be so much fun.
We're running out of time here so just a quick reminder to write-in "Welcome to Douche nation"!
As the official town slogan for pawneecity.gov.
Or you know what would also be kind of dope for the people of Douche nation to do?
It's vote for another slogan.
Like, you know, "Storied past, bright future"?
ButI don't care.
I don't give a fart, bros.
You know, just do your thing, chicken wing.
Hey, Crazy Ira, have you seen my stick?
- Where's your stick?
- I don't know.
Lesbo Baggins, you know where my stick is?
- You-- - Oh!
Found my stick.
Oh, where did you find it?
Up Leslie Knope's butt!
- Yo, where my stick up?
- It's up her butt, papi.
Jewish Greg, whatever we're paying you, it's not enough.
Damn it, I almost pulled that off.
No, you really didn't.
Just delete the poll.
Let the slogan thing go.
Or, maybe we sneak back in there-- you distract those guys for, like, 30, 90 minutes, I get on live radio, I give an impassioned speech about what slogan I want to endorse and I play a few songs, which I always wanted to do, and then we just see what happens.
No.
I should just let this go.
Okay.
Dude, what are you doing?
That looks like a perfectly good saxophone case.
Wait a minute.
What's inside that case?
I am ending my secret musical career.
- I have to kill Duke Silver.
- No, come on, man.
You're really good.
- You can't quit.
- Sorry, Andrew.
I would rather never play again than have everyone know my secret.
Good-bye, Duke Silver.
May you restin jazz.
So, Tom told you are sort of like a computer expert.
Uhyeah.
You can say that.
These jerks are trying to hijack my online poll, and so far the leading town slogan is, "Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt".
Yeah, yeah.
I voted for that one.
Great.
I'm wondering, is there a way I can communicate - with everybody who voted?
- Yeah, I can do that.
Should take about two minutes.
Just PayPal me some bitcoins when you get a chance.
What?
So, this is way under your budget.
Used to be a donut shop.
Well, a tire shop - that sold donuts.
- Pretty rough.
I mean, I guess I could fix the roof and tear up the counters.
Do something about the smell.
This place is creepy.
I mean, I love it, because it reminds me of the cafeteria in a haunted nursing home, but that's just me.
This is the last listing I have that isn't an active crime scene.
Hey, man, what happened?
I thought Jurassic Fork was super popular.
We stretched ourselves too thin by expanding to a second location.
You opened another dinosaur-themed restaurant?
No, another Steven Spielberg-themed restaurant.
The German place downtown-- Schindler's Lunch.
I think you may have misunderstood what people liked about Jurassic Fork.
I actually think the space is pretty cool.
Obviously, we'd had to move this T-Rex, but-- No can do.
That's a load-bearing T-Rex.
This is really the last place you have available?
Dang.
Maybe Tom's Bistro wasn't meant to be.
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, real quick.
Remember when you said you would close up shop - on the slogan thing?
- Yes.
You did do that, right?
You didn't somehow get the email addresses for every person who voted for the "Stick up the butt" slogan and then write each of them a personalized heartfelt email telling them to do the right thing and vote for a real slogan?
Are you crazy?
What a crazy talk you just did with your funny words.
Well, someone wrote those emails.
And we got about 300 complaints and as a cherry on top some hackers got really mad about the invasion of privacy and attacked the website.
Look what they did to Peebo.
He's wearing a hat made of penises.
Oh, boy.
Well, I.T. is fixing the website, but it will be down for about three days.
Well, no worries, I will handle all of the overflow work personally.
Parking tickets, code violations-- - send them all to me.
- What's going on?
I don't know.
I spoke to grant about the national parks job, and he mentioned that's mostly big picture planning and delegating, and not very much nitty-gritty, hands-on stuff that I love to do.
I would miss that, very much.
I mean, have I really pulled my last bloated raccoon carcass from a public fountain?
But that's the whole point of moving up the ladder, you get to think bigger, swim in a bigger pond.
You're having a public forum on the slogan, right?
Use it as a test.
Hand the reins to someone else, let them handle things while you manage from a distance.
Yeah.
That's a good idea.
I guess I should practice delegating.
Ugh!
Okay.
The public forum will be run by Oh, no, I would not have started the sentence if I knew Larry was the only one here.
Babe, if you can step back and let Larry take control, you can survive anything.
All right.
Larry, can you get in here?
I would love to.
Gosh darn it.
I-I somehow ran my belt through a slat in this chair so I'm kind of--I'm kind of stuck to it now.
Great.
You really shouldn't have dug that out of the dumpster.
I had to.
Also I had a banana on the way over here.
Sorry.
I get why you don't want any more to know about Duke Silver, and you don't have to worry.
You secret is safe with me.
To even it out, I'm gonna tell you all of my secrets.
Oh, no, that's not necessary.
I once forgot to brush my teeth for five weeks.
I didn't actually sell my last car.
I just forgot where I parked it.
I don't know who Al Gore is.
And at this point I'm too afraid to ask.
When they say 2% milk, I don't know what the other 98% is.
When I was a baby, my head was so big scientists did experiments on me.
I once threw beer at a swan, and then it attacked my niece Rebecca.
That'll do, Andrew.
You don't have to play the unity concert.
But don't quit music.
Please.
- Tommy.
- Hey.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
I just got excited about the restaurant but I should probably call my investor and tell him we have a problem.
Well, I got you something to cheer you up.
Watch cologne.
Cologne for watches.
Thanks.
Things used to make me so happy.
But I've grown a lot in the last year.
Now I just want one big thing, my own restaurant, named after me, that makes me so much money I can buy anything I want.
I should go.
I didn't want Tom to leave, so I said all these bad things about the restaurant, so he wouldn't like them.
Damn, we should have coordinated.
I don't want to lose that weird little elf either.
That's why I showed him all those crappy places.
Oh, I thought you were just bad at your job.
Sorry.
What should we do?
Let me call some people.
Hello, everyone, and welcome to a public forum to choose our new town slogan.
I'm gonna hand things over to Larry Gengurch, who is 100% in charge.
Well, let's just get started, huh?
I want to talk about-- Oh, it's the-- geez Louise-- This keeps happening.
I don't know why.
I think the slogan should be "Pawnee, home of crackers, the orangest goldfish in Indiana".
- Okey-dokey.
- No.
Let me write it down.
- Who even needs a slogan?
- Well, now, that is an interesting point.
No, that's my slogan idea.
"Who even needs a slogan"?
And then a big picture of me flipping everybody off.
Let's keep our eye on the ball here, Douche nation, "Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt".
Butt stick!
Butt stick!
Butt stick!
Let's vote on it right now!
Butt stick!
Butt stick!
Okay.
Who's next?
Yes, ma'am.
This slogan is gonna go on every sign in town.
I think it should be something real that we can all be proud of.
I've lived in Pawnee my whole life and it could be a strange place, but overall it's a warm, and wonderful town.
My idea for a slogan is, "When you're here, then you're home".
Well, that's lovely.
I actually had it printed up so we can see what it would look like.
Oh, you-- Hm--there's--that's--that's spelled wrong.
That should be "then", t-h-e-n.
Stay strong.
Let them work it out.
And trust Larry.
Trust Larry?
Are you listening to yourself?
I like that slogan a lot.
But you made a little mistake there.
- You see?
- Back off.
"You're" is spelled wrong.
It should be "y-o-u-r".
Oops, I didn't catch it.
Thank you.
No, no, no, she made a possessive.
- She's getting further away.
- It's okay.
Okay, let's vote.
All those in favor.
Approved!
Man, the places that came on the market today are way nicer than the listings we saw yesterday.
I know, crazy, right?
Real estate.
This property is under your budget, and it's got everything on this wish list you gave me.
Except the two helipads.
Does it have one helipad?
I don't know.
I like it, butseems a little small.
No, I think it just seems small because of all the heavy furniture.
But that part is really great.
The lighting is really cool.
I think this is the one.
You know, I think you're right.
I'll do it.
Thanks, April.
And, hey, bonus, it's pretty close to city hall.
You guys are gonna be regulars.
I'll keep a table open for you.
And special thanks to Leslie Knope for once again bringing about positive change to this town.
Pawnee, I present to you, your new slogan.
You fixed the mistakes.
I held it together for the entire meeting.
Let me have this one.
I'm done micromanaging.
I promise.
Then I'm sure you are okay with the fact that they installed the sign the wrong way and it's welcoming you to Pawnee as you're leaving.
What?
No!
Oh, son of a-- Hey, you passed the test.
Honestly, there's something else I'm worried about.
The kind of work that I've been doing all these years, the nuts and bolts, the grunt work, that's the stuff I know how to do.
What if I take this national parks jobs and I justfail?
- Hm.
- What if I'm not good at it?
Yeah.
Leslie, I love you, very much.
But this is the stupidest thing you've ever said.
You'd be amazing.
And everyone's gonna be in awe of how amazing you are, so just shut your month.
Hey, are we leaving or entering?
We've been driving around in circles.
You're--

Aw, babe, you've gone crazy.
The only thing I am crazy about is a magnificent, pregnant manta ray named Ann Perkins.
I am ranking topics of conversation for our next phone call.
The worst part about your best friend living in another stupid state is the topics really pile up.
What do you think should be higher priority?
Infinity scarves or whether or not it's worth it for me to get Showtime?
Is this really necessary?
When she moved, we promised each other that we would talk every day, and we've really fallen behind.
I know your female friends are very important to you, but I'm always a good sounding board.
I mean, I can talk about Sandra Bullock skirt length.
No, no, babe, you can't--you would just embarrass yourself.
Plus, every time I start talking to you, five seconds later, I want to jump your bones.
Oh, let's do that instead.
See, that's what I'm talking about.
- Yeah, okay, let's do this.
Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
On to the unity concert.
Ben is meeting with the tent people to finalize those deals.
April and Donna will be helping me with the vendor location charts, and I will be meeting with the surveyors about the concert grounds.
I would like to volunteer to do the park survey myself.
Wow, Ron.
I always knew there would be a day when I would get through to you and you would love government work.
Today is that historic day.
Yes.
That is what has happened.
Spending the day outside alone sounds like a dream.
I love being a father, but there are a few things I miss.
Silence, the absence of noise, one single moment undisturbed by the sounds of a children's TV program called Doc McStuffins.
There is no quiet anymore.
There is only Doc McStuffins.
Sorry I'm late.
Uh, Andy, why don't you go with Ron and help him?
- I really don't need-- - Shotgun!
I call shotgun.
Where are we going?
Doesn't matter.
Shotgun.
Shotgun on all rides for the rest of the day.
For the rest of my life.
In any car!
Ha ha!
I just faced you suckers!
So I'll see you in the parking lot, Ron.
Later!
Is the tent guy left-handed or right-handed?
I just need to know which way to part my hair to get us a better price.
It's a business theory I'm working on.
I really don't think it matters.
Pretty straightforward deal.
A straightforward deal?
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't have my straightforward deal fedora on me.
We gotta stop by my storage unit on the way up.
Hey, Larry.
Hey, you wanna come with us to tent world?
Little road trip?
Tent world?
Yeah, let me grab my lunch.
No.
Why'd you invite Larry?
He's been doing all the paperwork for this deal.
He deserves to come.
Remember you said that when Larry's farting up the car.
Larry isn't that bad.
He's nice.
And frankly, I don't care who knows that I said that, as long as no one knows that I said that.
Okay, ladies, I will be in my office for one to seven hours for my weekly chat with Ann.
I brought some fresh snacks.
And I made a backup plan for the vendor chart in case, you know, yours isn't good.
Actually, Ann called while you were in the bathroom.
She said something came up, she'll call you later.
I don't know, I told her to leave you a voice mail.
Ugh!
God, why'd you let me say all that?
I'm coming, Ann's voice mail!
I'm coming!
Listen to me very carefully.
I have not been taken.
I know that's always your first fear when I'm not available, but this is not a Liam Neeson Taken scenario.
That's exactly what they'd make you say.
Also, no one's making me say this.
I am a free woman, untaken, simply going about my business.
I just have to run.
Something came up.
I love you, and I'll call you later.
Donna.
What's good, baby?
What's going down in Donna town?
What's the haps in Meagle-wood?
I'm listening to Jaleel Or No Deal.
It's a podcast where the kid who played Urkel reviews old Deal Or No Deal episodes.
It's pointless, and I love it.
Okay, don't let me interrupt.
April, what's the 411, little mama?
What's the hot goss?
Who you crushing on these days?
Ew, my husband, weirdo.
Can I get back to work now?
Thanks.
Bye.
Work?
You can work whenever.
Except for now, because now is lady time.
You sound like a tampon commercial.
I'm setting up an impromptu Galentine's day.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Wait, I thought you weren't gonna do Galentine's day this year because that she-beast moved away.
I believe her name was Satan?
Her name is Ann, and she is gone, and I have accepted it, and we are gonna have Galentine's day.
Ladies, up front.
I need an Ann who lives in Pawnee, and there is no one obvious candidate, so I will test them out on the ultimate battlefield of female friendship-- Galentine's day brunch.
It will be a women's-only marathon bonding session with tons of whipped cream.
Side note, do not Google that phrase.
Hey, Ron.
Can I ask you kind of an important question?
You know, like, when you go to the ATM and you get money, is there an actual guy standing behind the wall who slides dollar bills in there?
- No.
- Yeah.
It's robots.
Oh, actually, you know what?
I do have a serious question.
In the movie Predator, can you rub any kind of mud on yourself to prevent predator from seeing you with his thermal heat signature sight, or is it more-- Ow!
That sucks.
Are you hurt?
No.
All good.
All good.
Oops.
Except for my mouth.
Oh, whoa.
Five-second rule.
No, ahh.
Come on, we better get you to a dentist.
Oh, my God, Larry.
Your tuna fish sandwich stunk up my suit.
- Gayle made it for me.
- Irrelevant.
You know what?
Stay out here and double-check these deal memos.
If you get through 'em, triple-check 'em.
Just don't come inside.
Sounds good.
I will finish my sandwich and enjoy the view.
Hey, Harvey.
Ben Wyatt.
We spoke on the phone.
Yeah.
Yeah, we sure did.
Okay.
Who's this little genie right here?
Tom Haverford, Pawnee business liaison.
Okay.
Got your contracts for you right here.
Wow.
It's a lot thicker than the original one-page version.
I take tents pretty seriously, Ben, I'm a tent guy.
I got over 1,300 tents in this warehouse alone.
over 2,000 square feet, and exactly 4 of 'em were once rented by Miss Rene Russo.
- Whoa!
- Yeah.
No doy.
I think I know what I'm doing.
So I added a few syllables and whatnot.
Clauses, et cetera.
Addendums, what have you.
Why don't we go ahead and sign that for me?
Yeah, I think we're gonna need to take a look at this.
Hmm.
So I guess this is not a straightforward deal.
Shauna, I'm so glad you could make it.
You're so tan.
Oh, thanks.
I just got back from a solo trip to Rome.
I was gonna go with my boyfriend, but he couldn't come because he decided to stay with his wife.
Oof.
I love Rome.
It's such a great place.
Rome's played out.
Have y'all been to Kuala Lumpur?
- When did you go to Asia?
- I go all the time.
Where do you think I got that crystal Buddha head above my jacuzzi?
You have a jacuzzi?
Good to know.
Prospects for new Pawnee best friend.
Donna Meagle.
Confident, worldly, we go way back.
April Ludgate.
Vivid imagination, young, and vibrant.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Pretty, fragile, makes terrible life decisions.
A real fixer-upper, but look, it's not like Ann was doing so hot when I met her.
Ethel Beavers.
Bit of a dark horse.
Crotchety, but probably wise.
And then we got Evelyn, aka fake Ann.
I don't know her last name.
Honestly we just needed bodies.
Thank you, everyone, for getting together on such short notice, and happy Galentine's day.
Now, this is not technically the right date, but any time a group of women get together for brunch, we embody the spirit of the holiday.
Today we will celebrate friendship, spend a few hours together, and answer a couple of questions I've compiled.
Just for fun.
Nothing serious.
But please answer them with complete honesty 'cause I'll be able to tell if you're lying.
- To girlfriends!
- Yay.
- Girlfriends.
- Whoo-hoo!
Okay, it's time for a little Galentine's day Q&A.
Donna, you pick first.
"What is your favorite TV show"?
Well, for live tweeting, it's Scandal.
For binge watching, it's Scandal.
But for fashion, it's actually Scandal.
My answer is Scandal.
Hmm.
April?
Ooh, I love watching Russian traffic accidents on YouTube while I play children's music at the wrong RPM.
I like beauty pageants.
Everyone is so happy and perfect.
I like Diagnosis Murder.
And skin flicks.
Can anybody top me off?
The correct answer for favorite TV show is Friday Night Lights.
- The correct answer?
- Next question.
Okay, this contract is insane.
It costs extra to have people inside the tents?
And what's a flap tax?
Well, you need flaps, bro.
A tent without flaps is basically a parachute.
An unfolding charge?
A noise damage waiver?
How can noise damage tents?
Shh.
Keep your voice down, please, there's tents here.
Now, look, you can argue with me all you want, but for every line item that you two idiots disagree with, there's gonna be a $50 discussion surcharge.
What are we up to, doll?
$400.
A discussion surcharge?
That's nuts.
$450.
That's it.
Deal's off.
We'll take our business elsewhere.
Suit yourself, gentlemen.
Sorry we couldn't make a deal.
Wait, wait.
Let me try one more thing.
What's the price now?
$80 more.
I liked it better the other way.
Does have an effect, though.
The receptionist says she'll fit you in as soon as there's an opening.
If you're all right, I'm gonna head back to the park.
Wait, wait, wait, real quick, real quick.
Do you know what my social security number is?
Or if I'm allergic to anything?
I don't like corn.
Should I put that down?
Or will that be confusing?
Because I do like candy corn.
Oh, Ron.
What a mess.
Here, let me help you.
All I wanted was two hours where I got to forget that I was a parent.
Ron, look.
I found all three differences.
Those are two completely different pictures.
- "Ladies' choice".
- Ooh!
Wild card option.
Okay, anybody reveal anything about their life, anything at all.
I've gotten two annulments.
One for pleasure, and one to cap off a long con I was running against Keith Sweat.
Wow.
Ethel, have you-- Okay, Ethel's asleep.
Shauna?
I'm writing a memoir based on my blog.
It's called Tweeping Up Appearances, and it's about my journey to find happiness by smiling through the pain.
Okay, I can work with that.
Knope, what you got going on in that notebook?
Just jotting down memories in my trusty old journal.
"Friendship rankings".
What's that?
It's not what it sounds like.
It's simply a way for me to figure out which one of you is the best.
That's messed up.
Yeah, that is really lame, and I'm leaving.
You're better than that, Knope.
Donna, why are you angry?
You were in first place.
Bye, everyone.
This was a really brunch.
Leave the bag.
If you do this again next year, don't call me.
Well, by default, it's Shauna.
That's how you want to find your new best friend, right?
By default?
My pores are clogged up from being in that dusty warehouse.
I'm gonna check if this gas station has some biore strips.
Aw, thanks, Larry, that's nice of you.
Gayle always has me do the windshield.
She likes to stand behind me and watch.
According to her, it's the best view.
- How is Gayle?
- Oh, wonderful.
- And the girls?
- They're good.
- Why do you want to know?
- I'm genuinely interested.
I'm sorry.
I'm just not used to people from the office asking me things.
It's kind of scary.
But in a good way, though.
Aw, man, did I miss a Larry fart?
Oh, no, uh, we were just-- Yeah, Tom.
Yeah, I-I really ripped one.
Didn't I, Ben?
Yeah.
Yeah, it was loud.
Smells like a hippopotamus took a dump on a skunk.
It's in your best interest.
Well, the numbers don't lie.
I'm a goofus, not a gallant.
Been here forever.
Can we go?
Don't you want to get your tooth fixed?
I don't know, I think my tooth looks fine just like this.
Well, my grandmother was missing that tooth, and she was the most beautiful woman on her oil rig.
You are an adult.
I am not your dad.
- If you want to go, we can go.
- Yay.
Thanks, Ron.
That's why you know even though you're not my dad, you're like an old brother to me.
Like a cool uncle, but old.
Like a grandpa.
But cool like a son.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
No problem.
That'll be $8, please.
What, you're charging us for coffee?
What kind of a business-- uh-oh.
Oh, hello, gentlemen.
Gotta be kidding me.
You own this place too?
That's right, dickweed.
You wanna talk deal?
Because my prices have gone up ever so slightly since I saw you last.
No, we're not giving in to your crazy demands.
There are plenty of other tent rental places within driving distance.
Yeah, I'm calling Tent Emporium right now.
Tent Emporium.
How can I help you, buttface?
- What?
- Come on.
Yes.
I own every tent store in Southern Indiana.
Tent Town, Rent Ten Tents, the Tent Offensive, and Ace Tentura Tent Detective.
I also own a chick-fil-a franchise, but that's not doing so hot right now.
Whatever.
Let's get outta here.
You've reached the Tentagon.
How can I help you, buttface?
Okay, here's an idea.
Why don't we find something, anything, no matter how small, that we have in common?
For example, I'm an only child.
Me too.
Although, when I was in college I found out that my dad had a second family.
Well, we were the second family, technically.
Okay, well, we both went to college.
- There's that.
- Yeah.
Oh, my God!
Ann had her baby!
Wow, this has been fun.
The bill is already paid.
May I gently suggest that you check out Chris Traeger's wonderful therapist Dr. Richard Nygard.
Although there is a tiny part of me that always thought it was just Chris talking into a mirror.
Anyway, maybe you should look him up.
I don't know, I read a book once that said a woman should never make the first move.
That doesn't apply to therapy.
Okay.
Good luck!
Oliver Perkins-Traeger, meet your Aunt Leslie.
Hey!
Oh, he's so beautiful.
And you're so beautiful.
I mean, you're always beautiful, but right now you are the most beautiful, glowing sun goddess ever.
Why didn't you tell me you were in labor?
Well, 'cause I knew you'd drop everything and rush here, and contractions can sometimes go for days.
Thank you.
So I didn't want you to be stuck waiting around.
Well, I'm glad I'm here now.
Where's Chris?
Oh, he was such a good coach that the nurses asked him to help out with a delivery down the hall.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow!
Andrew, you need to get your tooth fixed.
No way.
I'm not going back there.
I already won all the magazine mazes.
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.
Ow!
If you don't take care of the problem now, it's only gonna get worse.
- Come on.
I'll drive you back.
- Fine.
Let me just wolf down this peanut brittle real quick.
Why would you do that?
Oh, right.
'Cause calories.
We're dead.
The only tent store this guy doesn't own is 300 miles away.
Oh, hang on.
Here's a place that might work.
It's called Sweaty Roger's Pants Tent.
Oh, no, you can't rent tents there.
Hey, guys.
Look, I was double-checking all the paperwork that Tom gave me in that super fun parking lot, and there was something about Harvey's corporate structure that just seemed fishy.
So I dug around-- and it turns out he has got a lot of code violations.
Whoa!
Larry, this is great stuff.
Never thought I would say it, but I'm a genius for making you stay outside and do a menial task.
Couldn't agree more.
You did it, Tom.
Mm, I don't want to drive back.
I miss you so much.
No one even comes close to you as a friend.
I even tried to rank the women at work, - but that was a total bust.
- You ranked them?
Well, I thought maybe I could use Galentine's day as an opportunity-- Leslie, Galentine's day?
What do you want me to do, Ann?
I need to find a replacement, and don't worry, it didn't work.
Nobody can match your ethnic hybrid energy.
Everybody brings their own unique strengths to the table.
Some that even I don't have.
You shut your mouth.
You have all the strengths.
Look, you love harder than anyone I know.
It's tough to match.
And I know Donna and April don't show it, but they would do anything for you.
And it's not like you and I always see eye to eye.
I mean, Friday Night Lights?
I am more of a Riggins girl, and you lean Saracen.
Yeah, 'cause Riggins is a criminal.
He took the fall for his brother.
Okay, he didn't watch out for his brother.
You know, I'm not having this conversation with you again.
That family is garbage.
The point is we didn't always like the same stuff when we first became friends.
Just don't force it.
Give it some time.
I know, you're right, Ann.
Thank you.
It's just I'm missing you, and there's so much stuff I want to talk to you about.
Well, you're here now, so let's talk.
Oh.
I think Oliver has more pressing business.
Okay, but we should talk soon, 'cause I almost bought a toe ring the other day.
What?
Ann, you're somebody's mother.
- I know.
- Okay.
I'm gonna give you two some time.
I'll call you from the car.
I'll be out here if you need me.
Thanks for doing this, Ron.
When it's all said and done, there were a few mazes I'd cheated on.
Also, the inside of my mouth is black and hot.
So do I strip down to my underwear, or all the way naked?
Hello, Diane.
I'm coming home soon to relieve you, give you a little break.
It's no trouble at all.
I'm a parent.
I'm always on duty.
What flavor ice cream would you and the children like?
I'm getting some for a 30-year-old who works for me, so I can bring some home for you too.
Hello, Harvey.
We found a glaring number of code violations you've committed.
I could see to it that you never rent another tent in this region again.
Gentlemen, I've won two online satellite Jamaican poker tournaments.
I can tell that you're bluffing.
Your Pawnee business license has lapsed, which negates most of the deals you've made this year.
I'm guessing you're pretty bad at poker.
I am.
And I was bluffing about winning those tournaments.
Gentlemen, clearly there's been a misunderstanding here.
I'm hoping that we can reach some kind of a compromise.
Yeah, first off, I need to know where you got these zebra-print pillows.
Second of all, I got a Tin Cup Blu-Ray itching for a Rene Russo signature.
Tom.
The compromise is that you're gonna sign the deal we originally agreed upon.
We're going to let you continue renting tents, and you're going to do it at a fair price.
And Larry, he's the guy that brought you down, and he's gonna be watching you like a hawk.
Oh, hey.
I'm Larry.
Great to know you.
I love tent world.
God!
Can you just be cool for one second?
Okay, black coffee with extra grounds.
Gross.
For April.
And a mocha ice blended for Donna.
Guys, I totally blew it.
I was all screwed up, and I'm really sorry.
You're wonderful friends, and I love you.
We love your crazy ass too, Knope.
I think you're fine.
Like a solid B-minus.
Great.
I'll take it.
We know you've been missing Ann, so we got you this.
Press the paw.
Hi, Leslie.
It's Ann.
I love you, and everything's gonna be okay.
It's cute, right?
I'm very lucky to have you both.
You know, when Ann and I used to fight, we would make up with a five-minute hug.
Mm, you touch me and I stab the bunny.
Yeah, it's about time for my mid-morning mani, so I'm gonna head out.
Okay.
Well, that's fine.
Well, you know, we'll forge our own unique traditions in the fiery cauldron of female friendship.
I'm just an impartial bunny, but I think Ann sucks.
Also-- I'm the zodiac killer.
And we might even be able to pull it off under budget.
Sorry.
Sorry, you guys, I'm sorry.
I'm trying to find my inhaler, 'cause I'm having a little Take your time.
I mean, it's not like we're trying to get work done here.
Yeah, and Larry, by the way, you're looking in the wrong spot.
Your inhaler is hidden under the pile of pistachio shells on my desk, obviously.
Okay, well, that's funny, 'cause I'm terribly allergic to pistachios.
Classic.
Okay, you know what?
I need to say something.
I like Larry.
He is a good friend and a fine man with an inexplicably gorgeous wife-- I mean, to the point where it makes no sense at all.
Sorry.
Getting off track.
He is a nice person, and we should all stand up and say, "I like" Ben!
No!
What are you doing?
Uh, he's embarrassing himself and throwing away his career.
- Sweetheart, stop.
- O, captain, my captain.
- What is happening?
- Larry is my friend.
Thank you, Ben.
I mean that.
Oh!
Got so startled I tooted.
Come on, man.
- Oh - Gross!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
God!
Sorry!
Sorry!
What's happening?
I can't hear!
And I'm dying!
Baby, relax.
I just wanted to surprise you.
Open the bottom drawer and read the cake.
"Will you go to prom with me"?
Well, this just keeps getting weirder.
Because of the merger, schools have had to make some cuts, and the first thing to go was the senior prom.
So as a last-minute hail Mary, the parks department is throwing prom for them.
They also wanted to cut A.P. Latin, so I volunteered to teach Latin.
Which reminds me, I need to learn Latin.
I can't stop thinking about that job in Chicago, and I think this prom will be a good distraction.
In my senior year when I couldn't decide between Indiana and Amherst, I focused all my energy on planning my prom, and it was the best prom ever.
Plus, I made out with Harvey from the A.V. Club.
Hmm, I think I'm jealous of Harvey.
You shouldn't be.
A few weeks later, he almost died from a VCR electrocution.
Legend has it that he can still turn on a microwave just by blinking at it.
The point is, will you go to the prom with me?
Well, I thought you'd never ask, because we're nearing 40.
Course I will.
Yay!
Prom!
Okay, we are making progress, prom committee.
Now, our budget is basically zero, so we're gonna need to cover all the jobs that we would normally hire people for.
Tom, you're in charge of music.
Oh, man.
Well, all right.
Aw, did you want to DJ, little puppy?
I didn't know that little puppies could operate an iPod with their little puppy paws.
Eew and boo.
This kind of thing is getting out of hand with you two.
Y'all are on official warning.
I did DJ a little back in the day.
I had a show called "Zoot Suit Wyatt" on Carleton College radio.
Tuesdays from 3:00 to 5:00 A.M., I was the king of swing.
I thought we as a culture agreed to forget the year that everyone was into swing.
Okay, Ben, you can co-DJ with Tom.
- Yes.
- What!
No!
If you eclipse my flavor in any way, we'll have a problem.
All right, Allison, you are in charge of choosing the prom theme, and now it has to be perfect and magical and look like a million bucks but cost zero bucks.
So what do you got?
I was thinking the theme could be "Fairy tale".
The theater department did Into the Woods last year, and we still have the scenery.
I laid out some preliminary plans in this binder.
Wow!
Are those jense-trodder color tabs?
I thought those were discontinued.
They were.
I had to order them through some Mexican back channels.
Juan Julio Oficina Supplies?
I thought they went out of business.
They did, but they opened up a new one in Oaxaca.
What is happening right now?
Okay, everybody get back to work.
And, Allison, come by my office later so we can keep crushing it.
All right, let's go over our set list.
- Set list?
No need.
- So, what, you're just gonna put your iPod on shuffle?
No, but I could.
You want to know why?
Because every single song you own is a banger?
Every song I download has to pass a series of rigorous tests to answer one simple question: Is it a banger?
How many beats per minute?
How many drops?
How dope are the drops?
Were any acoustic instruments used?
If so, it is not a banger.
I once accidentally downloaded a Lumineers song.
I had to throw away my whole computer just to be safe.
I feel like, to me, set list flow is very important.
I mean, we're basically vibe curators.
Ugh.
Oh, no.
I hope that high school auditorium's big enough, 'cause I'm bringing Sometimes it's really hard to be friends with you.
Thank God we don't have to be seen together.
Yes, we do.
We're co-DJs.
Not anymore.
You're working with DJ Robo Drop.
Ba-da-da, mm, mm, mm, mm-mm Oh, I hope that this prom is exactly like my senior prom.
Theme: "My heart will go on".
Photo booth with Monica Lewinsky look-alike.
After-party-- Megan Rickerson's house.
Her parents used to let us drink as much as we wanted.
That's--that's where we should have this after-party.
Or, no, we can't, because they moved to prison.
Prom is nothing but a huge party full of smiling, dancing people enjoying themselves.
It's literally my worst nightmare.
And I hate punch.
April Ludgate, I'm gonna sing to you a song that I first wrote 15 years ago for my prom date, Sarah Weiss.
You're as hot as the sun but you're as cold as ice let me take you to paradise come on, roll the dice it will be twice as nice Sarah Wei--April Ludgate will you go to prom with me?
Boom!
Will you?
Fine.
I'll go with you, because Leslie's making us, and we live together, and we only have one car right now because you laked mine.
What does "laked" mean?
I tried to jump it over a lake.
Why don't you stay out of our conversations, Larry!
Will do.
So I want to show you some very cool before and after pictures of Cherryhurst Park, one of our greatest accomplishments.
Why are you showing me all this?
Because I think you have a real knack for public service.
We here at the parks department have something called "The April Ludgate Summer Solstice Druid Festival and Buffalo Wings Eating Contest".
I don't know why I let her name it.
Basically, it's a summer internship program.
I think you'd be great.
Do you want to work here?
Definitely!
I'm totally interested.
- Great.
- Allison Gliffert.
Hi, Mr. Swanson.
You two know each other?
Is there some secret society for the greatest humans on earth?
Do you meet Tom Hanks and Elena Kagan in the Statue of Liberty's crown?
God, this fake club I'm inventing is amazing.
Allison's father owns the hardware store I've been going to since before Allison was even born.
What brings you to the festering putrid stink hole on the armpit of freedom?
That's what he calls city hall.
Um, Leslie was just telling me about your summer internship, and I was thinking about taking it.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No.
I respect your father too much to let his daughter work for free for the government.
Why don't you get a paying job for the summer?
Why don't you shut your mustache?
- Sorry.
- You know what?
Tim Hautner, who owns the sawmill out on Lowell Drive, is a personal friend.
He's always looking for bright young employees to give money to in exchange for honest work.
That would be awesome.
I definitely need money for school.
Oh, really?
Is it worth a few bucks to get a million splinters in your fingers and then cut off your fingers accidentally, 'cause that will happen.
I have tolerated Leslie's pro-government ways because her annoying kindness and generosity sneakily made me like her as a person.
But I draw the line at corrupting America's youth.
I'm sure I can get Allison a job at Tim Hautner's sawmill.
I once did him a favor.
I built his sawmill.
I may be leaving this office soon.
I need to plant seeds for the next generation.
Interns become full-time staff, become department directors.
Circle of life.
The seasons turn.
It's really quite beautiful.
And if Ron tries to stop me, he can eat a big ol' bowl of butts.
Hee hee!
Hah hah yeah!
Pawnee!
Class of '99!
Uh-huh!
Ooh!
Girl, you look creepy.
Would you like a drink?
- All this stuff is free.
- No, it's not.
Why'd you pay for a limo?
Because it's prom.
If you don't show up in a limo, legally, they can't let you in.
Does your mom want to take pictures?
Uh, yeah, she does.
Hey, hey!
Orin!
Who's Orin?
I'm April's mom.
You two look adorable.
Ugh, just take the picture already, mom.
My baby is all grown up.
Have her home by 11:00.
Mom, stop embarrassing me.
Say good-bye to your father.
Bye, dad.
Good night, sir.
This is all the stuff we have to work with?
Where's everything I requested?
Where's my smoke machine?
Where's my girls dressed in Teddy Bear costumes?
Where's my Yeezus Mountain?
Yeah, tell me about it.
I specifically requested elliptical cartridges for the turntables.
How am I supposed to keep my Husker Du albums in near-mint condish?
Hey, I have an idea.
Why don't you throw them in the garbage?
My prom was right after I got impeached, so I couldn't leave the house without being egged.
But my parents threw me a prom in our living room.
I think I'm still messed up from it.
I was actually only at my prom for 15 minutes.
By the time I got my Armani suit pressed and got the little dimple on my tie just right, it was 11:45 P.M. My date was pretty pissed, but, uh, I looked fly as hell.
Leslie, thanks again.
We just wouldn't have had a prom without you.
This is A-plus work.
A-plus!
Thank you, Principal Russell.
Can I get that in writing?
Oh-ho, Leslie.
You haven't changed since high school.
I can't believe he gave you an A-plus.
Oh, did he?
I didn't even notice.
No bigs.
Listen, Allison, I have a question for you that's very important and very serious.
Listen to me closely.
Will you help me orchestrate the balloon drop?
Ms. Knope, it'd be my honor.
Oh, hooray!
- Allison.
- Oh.
I was subcontracted by the government to construct a lighting rig.
Would like to help me screw some angle irons onto some 2x4s?
- I'll give you $40.
- Yeah, sure.
I'll just be over here having fun.
See you soon!
I know what you're doing, Ron, and I will defeat you.
Mark my words.
Stop wasting helium.
It is intended for welding and filling air ships.
I attended prom with Susan Hofler.
Picked her up in my truck, we slow-danced to a Merle Haggard song, and then I left early to go to my shift at the quarry.
I was 12 years old.
Never went again.
Felt like I had outgrown it.
Well, we did it.
We went to prom.
Yay!
Let's go now.
No!
What?
Are you kidding?
This is awesome.
Look around.
The bloom of youth.
Like flowers on the sunset of an eagle's poetry.
- Andy, I hate teenagers.
- If you give this a chance, you're gonna love it, I promise.
It's like the movie Expendables 2.
First time, hated it.
Second time, hated it.
Third time, it was okay.
But then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth time I watched it, I realized something.
It's just--it's not good.
It's not a good movie.
Now that I've convinced you, why don't we go dance?
Um, I'm gonna go to the girls' bathroom to check the trash cans for babies, but you can dance if you want.
Really?
I love you!
Thank you!
Money's the motivation money's the conversation you on vacation we gettin' paid so Uh, hey, no one's really feeling this.
All right, not a 2 Chainz crowd.
I'll throw on some yeezy in a second.
Jeezy?
Weezy?
Oh!
You want some of that classic stuff.
All right, I'll break you off some of that Ja Rule.
Who's Ja Rule?
What?
How do you-- wha-- who's what?
The stuff you're playing is so old, it's probably trinking on grizzledump.
Hey, what's grizzledump?
And why is trinking on it bad?
Oh, my God.
I don't know what's cool anymore.
What's grizzledump, Ben?
What's grizzledump?
This moment, we own it So have you ever pulled a ceremonial cord before?
There's a little trick to it.
You want to hold it-- not too tight, sort of like a firm handshake-- and then move towards the ground in a rope-pulling motion.
So just pull the rope?
That's right.
Thanks, Leslie, for this, and for making prom happen in the first place.
Oh, you don't have to thank me.
Working for the government is its own reward-- Run, Allison, run.
You're wasting your time, Leslie.
Allison and I already had a good talk about the power of the hard-earned dollar.
Don't listen to him.
Now, when you pull the rope, don't look at the balloons.
Look at the faces of the people as the balloons drop.
That's what government is about.
Look at the faces.
No, look at the cage that is holding all of those balloons.
I assembled that cage and was paid for my labor, and I will use the money to buy shelter, fuel, and medicine.
Watch the cage.
Pull the rope.
Watch the faces.
- Watch the cage.
- Watch the faces!
Uh, erm Congratulations, Ron.
You've ruined prom.
Everybody's having a terrible time.
I didn't go to my prom.
I was dating an older fella back then.
Like I'm gonna dance with a bunch of kids while he's coaching Duke to the final four.
I just want to go home, but I feel bad because Andy's having such a good time.
Whoa!
How can I love someone when I hate everything he loves?
That's not true.
He loves a lot of dumb stuff, but he loves you the most.
If something's bothering you, just tell him.
It's always better to be direct.
Hey, girl.
Are you ready to go?
I feel like I told you to wait in the car.
Yeah.
See?
Be direct.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ugh!
You're finished, Knope.
I just spoke with Tim Hautner from the sawmill on my mobile telephone, and he's offering Allison a paying job.
She'll be assistant to the head mulcher.
Beat that.
First of all, your telephone is ridiculous.
And second of all, I already beat it.
She's gonna take that internship.
She pulled the rope.
There's no turning back!
Leslie.
Mr. Swanson.
May I see both of you in my office?
Now.
It has come to my attention that both of you have been harassing Allison about her summer employment decisions.
I wouldn't say "harassing" so much as persistently tormenting.
I am disappointed in you, Leslie.
No!
Don't be disappointed in me.
I've never had a principal or a teacher be disappointed in me.
I'm not sure that I'm equipped to handle it.
Whatever's going on between you two and Allison ends right now.
This is supposed to be a fun event for the kids.
You're absolutely right, and I will bow out immediately.
Thank you.
I think the only thing that matters is whatever A-pluses may or may not have been handed out, you know, are still in effect in perpetuity.
I have your word, then.
This ends now?
Absolutely.
Attention, everyone.
Now it is time for the most magical moment of any high school prom: The announcement of the winner of the Parks and Recreation's coveted summer internship.
Without further ado, help me congratulate Allison Gliffert!
Can we get a little music here maybe?
Probably just ruin the moment with something lame.
Leslie, I told you.
I don't know what I'm doing this summer.
That's okay.
I know what you're doing.
You're gonna take this internship.
You're gonna fall in love with public service.
You're gonna rise through the ranks.
You'll take over Ron's job as parks director.
You'll win a seat in congress, and then you and I will run against each other as president, but right before we find out who won, I'm gonna pat you on the back and say, "It's your turn, kid".
Sorry, children.
Forget this happened.
Continue with your awkward close-quarters gyrating.
And if this is the evening you decide to have sex, use protection, please!
Dude, if you're not gonna play anything, I'm stepping in.
Go ahead.
Play whatever you want.
Can't be any worse than this.
Hey, I love this song!
You actually like this?
Yeah, dude, it's classic rock.
Well, there's more where that came from, snoopies!
Sorry.
Tried to use slang.
That just came out.
I only listen to CDs.
It's the way music like this was meant to be heard.
But it's not even auto-tuned.
Where'd you get that dress?
I was buried in it.
Babe, huge news.
I just got us invited to Damian Keating's barn party.
He's captain of the soccer team, and he has a fake I.D., so I think he can get us all free beer.
What's wrong?
There's cupcakes and music.
Why aren't you having fun?
Because this prom reminds me that you had, like, a million friends in high school and everyone thought you were awesome, and I spent four years making fun of everyone and hiding mops so the janitor would think he was going insane.
If we went to high school together, we would have never started dating, which means that we would have never gotten married, and I don't like thinking about that.
Hey, maybe we wouldn't have gotten together if we were in high school.
But that's because kids in high school are idiots.
The only thing that matters is that we found each other right now, and it's the best.
You know what?
Let's bail.
We got that limo for three more hours.
I think the extra length could help us get us over that lake.
No.
Let's stay.
I'll have fun.
I promise.
I have never told you this, but I actually have a ten-point scale for how insane you are being.
I observe your behavior, and if it's a five or below, I say nothing.
Smart.
Saves a lot of time.
If it reaches a six, like for example the incident with the girls' soccer uniforms back in '05 They wrote all the team names in pink.
Nobody told them to do that.
I try to steer you back to safety.
A seven is when I lock you in your office until you cool down.
This Allison Gliffert thing may have hit an eight.
I have the police on standby.
It's your move.
I'm thinking of leaving Pawnee, moving to Chicago.
I just need to make sure that the future is secure around here when I leave.
You know?
Allison would become April, and then April would become me.
I mean, let's face it, Ron.
I love you, but you're hopeless without me.
Blueprints for the future are a fool's errand.
They're like blueprints for a house.
Nice to have, but any foreman with half a brain doesn't need to look at them.
One day, this year or maybe the next, you're gonna be somewhere else.
So enjoy yourself now.
Damn it.
I just wish once you would say something stupid so I could ignore it.
Attention, please.
The votes are in.
And your Pawnee high prom king and queen areLucy Taylor and Andy Dwyer!
What?
I broke the box, and I threw away all the votes, and I voted for you a thousand times.
You should get on up there, King Dwyer.
Not without my queen.
Hi, Pawnee High.
As your prom king, I'm your ruler.
Silence!
My first decree of power is to declare that the prom queen shall be my wife, April Ludgate, who is the best thing that's ever happened to me who came to prom even though she hates it.
Give me this.
Always next year.
No, there isn't.
I'm a senior.
This is your wife?
How old are you?
He's 33, and I'm 47/immortal.
Get out.
High school forever!
Yeah, you're having fun now.
I rigged an election and got kicked out of prom.
I can get on board with that.
I look just like buddy holly oh, oh, oh and you're Mary Tyler Moore My life is over.
I'm officially old and uncool.
Might as well start wearing a plaid shirt and a tie and khakis and whatever shoes you're wearing.
Look, the fact that you don't know what high schoolers are into doesn't make you uncool.
It makes you a normal human adult.
You haven't had time to keep up 'cause the last few years, you started two different businesses.
I guess that's true.
Richard Branson and Mark Cuban are too busy making deals to keep up with what the kids are into.
How else do you explain their terrible haircuts?
And, hey, you may be old, but you'll never be as old as me.
Yeah.
You're old as .
Thanks, Ben.
Glad I could help.
The show goes on all night Allison, we wanted to apologize for acting so bananas.
You just have so much promise, we got excited.
You're a good kid.
And whatever you choose, you'll be great at it.
I have to say I admire you both.
You were right, Leslie.
Watching all those happy faces, it felt amazing.
But it was really nice to build something and get paid for it.
Ugh, Ron, she is so thoughtful and grounded.
Get her away from me, or I'm gonna kidnap her and try to mentor her to death.
Oh, let me introduce you to my boyfriend.
Greg Pikitis.
What up, Knope?
Hello, Gregory.
You guys know each other?
You might say that.
Come on, baby.
Let's get out of here.
That's that horrible kid who used to prank us all the time, right?
Offer is off the table.
She's a terrible person with terrible judgment.
Pikitis!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
I'd have to check, but I'm pretty sure we can handle that.
I do have one question.
Hold on.
Oh, my God.
Andy!
Oh, my Sorry.
Andy.
Are you getting sick?
It's flu season again, and I cannot get sick.
Stock up on Kleenex.
Don't touch your face.
Don't touch anything.
People are dropping like flies.
We already had to quarantine Larry.
Leslie, I don't feel good.
Can't I just work from home?
The tent is your home now, Larry.
We already forwarded your mail.
Oh, well, here's something that's going to make you feel really good.
Guess who I just secured as the headliner for the Unity Concert.
Chipp McCapp!
No!
Yes!
Nice!
Wait, no, I don't want to touch your hand.
Chipp McCapp is the most amazing 17-year-old country singer in the entire world.
He's like Indiana's sweetheart.
We are huge Chippmunks.
That's what his fans call themselves.
I don't know why.
Chippmunks.
Because of the animal?
No, that's too simple.
Yeah.
Okay.
His latest song, Beautiful Like My Mom parentheses  Has, like, two million hits on YouTube.
She don't care about no fancy trends She's just a mom from old South Bend Get home safe, boys, and thank you for protecting our freedom.
Let's play it again.
Play it again.
Today at a local vineyard, a bunch of sommeliers, AKA wine experts, are going to be competing for their certification.
I'm going to hire the best one at my new restaurant.
Tom's Bistro.
People that convince other people to buy expensive stuff they don't need.
Those are the real heroes.
Donna.
April.
Wine Country train is leaving the station.
You ready?
I want to come.
I love wine and everything about it.
The soil, the vines.
I studied botany for three years at Purdue University.
Go, Boilermakers!
There will be alcohol there, so I will go, as well.
Well, maybe I'll tag along.
I don't have anymore work to do.
Maybe it will be relaxing.
I didn't invite any of you.
I started with two cool people and I ended up with a bunch of grandpas.
Listen, grandpas.
When we get to the vineyard, there'll be a lot of fancy people there.
Please, I beg you, don't embarrass me.
How would we embarrass you?
You're already doing it.
I begged you.
I guess, now that we've got Chipp McCapp as our headliner, I can get rid of my awesome wish list.
Yeah, those are long shots.
"Bob Dylan's friends"?
I just thought maybe they could get Bob Dylan to come.
Land Ho.
God, I love them.
Everybody does.
But there's no way they're getting back together.
Their lead singer split 10 years ago.
He titled their last album We'll Never Reunite.
Leslie?
No!
Back in your tent, sicky.
I'm sorry, but Chipp McCapp's manager called.
He has to drop out.
No!
Okay, we need all hands on deck.
There are no hands to be on deck because everybody's at the winery.
Okay, Andy, you and I need to handle this.
We need to be operating at maximum  Oh, no.
Damn it, Larry!
Sorry.
Xander, my man-der.
Tom Haverford.
Owner, operator, and global ambassador for Tom's Bistro, opening this spring in Pawnee.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Damn.
Look at that tie dimple.
Respect.
My main target for Tom's Bistro?
Xander Truffant.
He's the best young somm in the game.
I don't say this lightly.
He's basically the Bruno Mars of Indiana amateur wine tasting.
If you'll excuse me, I must prepare for the tasting competition.
I pour saline water through my nose to clear the mucus from my smell centers.
That is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
Man.
It costs $200 to get certified.
I wanted to make fun of stupid people while I get drunk.
My two true passions.
You want to futz with these fools?
I will bankroll you.
Really?
Oh, hell, yeah, pimp.
Sounds like fun.
Thank you.
April Ludgate, professional drinker.
Uh, where did you study, Ms. Ludgate?
The Wine Academy.
The Wine Academy?
In Bordeaux?
Yes.
Carol, make sure she's in Group A. Uh, excuse me.
I want in, too.
I know I don't look the part, but I know everything about wine and I will prove it.
My name is Craig Middlebrooks, and this is my debit rewards card.
Why wouldn't you run this by me first, Dad?
Whatever.
Sorry, just weird family business.
Sounds private.
No need to discuss it with me.
My parents had this small, little vacation house on Lake Hubbard.
And now, they've sold it without telling the rest of us.
Did you not hear me say there was no need to discuss it with me?
My dad sent me this check out of the blue.
My share of the profits.
It's so disrespectful to the family structure Maybe a drink will help.
Put some alcohol in your mouth to block the words from coming out.
Some of our blueberry wine?
We make it right here at the vineyard.
I don't drink alcohol from that portion of the color spectrum.
Hey!
Whoa, that's strong.
Holy hell, that's a lot of alcohol.
We will take four bottles, please, and thank you.
All we need to do is go to Indianapolis, convince Chipp to do the festival and then, you know, head home.
Are you sure you're feeling up for this, boss?
I'm fine.
I've had the flu before, and I worked through it.
Okay.
Well, if you do collapse, luckily, I know first aid.
Or karate.
That's not first aid.
It is if you do it right.
Heimlich!
Oh, I guess while you get your medicine, I'll just stroll through the candy aisles, but won't get any.
You can buy two candies.
Two?
Can I help you?
I have the flu.
Super-nauseated for a few days, a lot of barfing.
It's a total disaster.
Plus, I have a ton of work to do, so I need the good stuff.
The Mariah-needs- to-sing-tonight stuff.
You don't look flushed, no signs of fever.
That just doesn't seem like the flu.
It's the flu.
I mean, I don't think it could be anything This counts as one.
I'm so mad at my parents.
I mean, they both wanted the house for Columbus Day weekend, and they fought so much, they decided to just sell it to spite each other.
More wine, less talking.
You know, you are a wonderful guy, and I admire many things about you.
But you're a terrible person to discuss personal problems with.
Thank you, friend.
That really means a lot to me.
Pumpkin, undertones of lavender.
Medium-plus body.
It's mostly pumpkin.
There's so much pumpkin, it's like a Charlie Brown Halloween special.
I'm getting notes of dried robin's blood, old, dirty cashews and just a hint of a robot's bathwater.
An old world wine.
Italian.
Ah.
It's a Verdicchio Doc Classico, 2010.
It's new world.
Northern California, Napa Valley.
Some place beautiful and warm and amazing where everyone is in great shape and the night sky is full of stars!
This comes from your mother's butt.
Man, you were in the bathroom forever.
The receptionist said that Chipp will be out in just a second.
Uh, I just need a minute.
I'm going to call Ben about nothing.
My parents make me so mad sometimes.
Just like the time they couldn't decide who gets the dog, so they just dropped it off at the local synagogue.
I was, like, "Say what"?
Hold on, Ron.
Hold that thought.
Just for a sec.
Hey, honey.
Hey.
It's your me.
It's wife.
It's Leslie.
Knope.
I have very big news for you.
Oh, well, my teeth are blue.
Blueberries What?
Are you having a stroke?
I was just saying to Ron that my dog's Jewish.
Oh.
Phone water.
Ben?
Hello?
Hello?
Hi.
Leslie?
It's dead.
Hello?
You know, Leslie sounded weird.
I don't want to wait for Tom.
I want to walk home.
I'll join you.
I'm always game for a brisk walk.
Also, if I leave you alone, I'm pretty sure you'll die.
Home is that way.
Watch out for that fence.
Ah, Mister Haverford.
Allow me to introduce Terrence Montreaux.
He is a restaurateur like yourself.
You own a restaurant, too?
No, monsieur.
I own 12.
I am here to find the best sommeliers as soon as they are, how you say, certified.
That was my idea.
That is everyone's idea.
That is why we have this, how do you say, thing.
Okay, don't act like you don't know the word "thing".
With a filet mignon, I'd recommend a red.
Something bold and dry, like David Sedaris.
Perhaps you could recommend a Riesling instead.
Not if you're eating steak, you loon.
You know in the movies, when the cops show up and they find lipstick on a wine glass next to a dead body?
This is that wine.
I'll bring the girls You bring the beer And the troops will bring the freedom We're sorry to interrupt, Chipp.
Hi.
We just wanted to say we are such big fans.
It's an honor to meet you.
Yeah.
Well, I'm very blessed.
And it's always nice to meet my amazing fans who keep me going.
You're the real superstars.
Thank you.
Can somebody give me one of those LunchStacks?
And stack them for me this time.
Cheese on top, or no one gets paid.
You got it, Chipp.
That's my dad.
Guy's such an idiot.
We wanted to talk to you about the Unity Concert in Pawnee.
Can you do it?
Yeah.
Uh, no.
I'm sorry, I got a previous engagement.
It's a bummer.
Oh.
Here you go, Chipp.
Look at that.
The cheese is on top.
Of turkey.
You dick.
I want ham.
Sorry, son.
They were out of ham.
All right, well, maybe I should just let Mom be manager, then?
Pick them up, Skipp.
Ew!
This guy's the worst.
I mean, it sucks that they didn't have ham.
But you can't treat your dad like that.
I know.
He's a monster.
But we need him.
Your job's not that hard, okay?
Just anticipate my needs.
Anticipating, Chipp.
Of the 25 entrants today, only one has deemed himself worthy of a sommelier certificate.
Oh, my God.
Are you sure?
No way.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, everyone.
I think we can agree that all wine tastes the same.
And if you spend more than $5 on wine, you are very stupid.
JUDGE  Security.
I just want to thank all the people that got me here.
Norbit, uh, Pluto Nash, all the Klumps.
Congratulations to the next Indiana Master Sommelier, Xander Truffant.
I've got to go talk to Xander before Terrence gets to him.
Cover me.
Got you.
Oh, my goodness.
Xander.
Yeah.
Look.
Tom's Bistro is going to be the dopest, quite possibly trillest restaurant in the area.
What do you say?
You want to work with me?
Thank you, but I've already accepted an offer from Monsieur Montreaux.
I'll double whatever he's paying you.
You'll pay me $500,000 a year?
I will pay you one-tenth of whatever he's paying you.
Sorry.
Aw, man, this wine bottle is all out of the wine.
Well, hello, gentlemen.
What brings you out on this fine evening?
Mother .
Whoa.
Where'd you come from?
Uh, that's a complicated question.
All depends on whether your conception of time is linear or circular.
What?
Hello, Ron.
Ron.
You know this hobo?
He was my counterpart from the Eagleton Parks Department.
Dude.
Are you a ghost?
Am I?
What is happening right now?
We know that you have that important other engagement Yo, I gots to get that haircut.
Snip!
It's not just Pawnee that needs you.
It's the entire region.
Permission to speak, son?
Pawnee is kind of the gateway to that whole region.
They do buy a lot of albums.
They sure ain't buying toothpaste.
Bunch of dirty hicks.
What if we fly me in and out same day, so I wouldn't have to spend a night in your crap town?
Excuse me.
Pawnee is a good town.
With good people from all walks of life.
Plus, it is an amazing place to raise kids and start a family.
You think I care about that?
Look.
I can do whatever I want.
All right?
If I want to shoot a paintball gun at my dad, I'm going to do it.
Good shot, son.
I'm proud of you.
You're crazy.
This is over.
Okay?
Pawnee does not need you.
And you should know that, when you shook my hand earlier, there was pee on my palms.
That makes us sound like hicks.
We're not.
Shut up.
Stupid.
Okay.
Let's go, Andy.
You know what?
That was awesome.
You were great.
I thought you were going to punch that kid's lights out.
It was not awesome.
I lost our headliner, I can't stop throwing up, and Ben has not called me back yet.
I'm sorry I'm so frazzled.
There's just a lot of things going on right now.
Personal things that I can't talk to you about.
You know, Leslie, sometimes life throws us crazy curves.
And yes, this moment may be the biggest curve you've ever had to deal with.
But just because your family is getting bigger does not mean that you can't handle it.
You and Ben can handle anything.
Wow.
Andy, thank you.
That's exactly what I needed to hear right now.
God, it's so weird that you know that I'm pregnant before Ben does.
Pregnant?
Holy crap!
Leslie!
Yeah.
What did you think?
I thought you were getting a dog.
Why did you go like this?
That's a sign for petting a dog that's sitting on your lap.
Pregnant?
Wow.
Oh, that's amazing.
Andy, I think we need to focus on the fact that we have lost our headliner.
We are out of options.
It's time for a Hail Mary.
How are we going to convince this guy to reunite Land Ho?
Same way I got a perfect score on the SATs.
Broken Scantron machine.
Okay, wait.
Andy, that is not a good strategy, okay?
I will give him a brief explanation about the Unity Concert.
And you stand by.
Stand by.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Hello?
Scott Tanner.
It's Scott Tanner.
Uh, hi.
My name's Andy.
And this barfing lady over here is Leslie.
We just need 10 minutes of your time.
To do what?
To convince you to reunite Land Ho.
Listen, it means a lot to me that you guys loved the band.
And I'm going to tell you the exact same thing I've told everyone who has ever asked us to reunite.
No.
Listen, I know that you and the band aren't on the best of terms right now.
But bringing people together is exactly what we want to talk to you about.
Hold that.
Hold that down at the bottom.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mr. Ron Dunn.
I have something I'm very angry about.
But other Ron, he's not helping me with it.
Can you help?
I can tell by the indigo on your Chiclet that you've been drinking blueberry wine.
That's a good start.
The Wamapoke called it "mattapiqua".
They believed it had mystical powers.
Yeah, it also tastes like jelly.
So, what's got your goat there, friend?
My parents, they had this lake house and they sold it without telling me.
And so, I was like, "Why"?
You know?
I was like, "God!
You guys"!
Oh.
You're hanging onto that anger for dear life, compadre.
Let's role play.
Well, goodnight, everyone.
I'm going to go home and feel totally fine.
Who am I kidding?
I'm going to go home, put on a Macy Gray album, and cry in the mirror!
Why are you bummed?
Are you all blind?
I want that job at Tom's Bistro.
I've been trying to show you for the last five hours.
Look, man, you know your stuff, but you're like a crazy volcano.
You'd have to show me you can bring it down a notch.
I'll bring it down 1,000 notches if I have to!
This looks like it's going to be a great concert.
The band just does not play anymore.
Well, I understand.
Excuse me.
Um, I'm sorry.
My stomach is trying to murder me.
You still drunk from last night?
I've been there.
You know, this town still loves you.
I'm in a band myself, actually.
Mouse Rat.
And we cover about five of your songs and they just go nuts.
Really?
Which ones?
Catapult me into the Sun And I'll burn, baby, burn Oh, yeah.
Johnny Karate?
I thought you said your name was Andy.
It is.
I'm also a children's performer.
He played at Joey's birthday and he's awesome.
Sing Karate Chop Master.
I'll do it as long as your dad sings along.
Let's do it.
It's easy.
You'll pick it up.
Karate chop master I'm a karate chop master And I will karate chop you Chop, chop, chop, chop Kick, kick, kick, kick, chop Scott, you sing.
Chop, chop, kick, kick Kick, kick, kick, kick, chop No.
Just listen to me.
Chop and a chop and a kick-kick-kick-kick chop And tighten the throat And chop-a-kick chop Now, your turn.
Chop, chop, kick, kick, chop Harmony!
Oh, my God!
Chop, chop, kick Chop, kick-kick-kick And a chop and a kick and a kick and a No.
No.
It's not You didn't I mean Just listen.
Good evening.
May I assist you with a wine tonight?
Yeah.
I'm having fish, so maybe a full-bodied red?
You know, sir, you might want to consider something white to go with your fish.
No.
Red.
And bring some ice cubes.
I like ice cubes in my red wine.
I'll have a glass of your most expensive red wine mixed with a glass of your cheapest white wine, served in a dog bowl.
And silly straws all around, please.
I'll be right back with my recommendations.
He seems to be keeping it together.
What kind of monster orders red with fish?
I know they're messing with me and it's just a test, but have some decency!
For you, sir, a light, crisp Pinot with just a hint of lemon to bring out the flavors in your fish.
I brought you a bold Cabernet, which should still taste okay when watered down.
And for you, madam, would you consider this rose?
It's halfway between red and white.
Thanks very much.
Enjoy.
I think I may have found my new sommelier.
That was so embarrassing!
We'll have to make sure the wine cellar at Tom's Bistro is soundproof.
That was beautiful.
You're surrendering to the Earth Mother.
Now, stare into the fire and picture your spirit animal.
I don't know what my spirit animal is.
Because it doesn't exist because that's nonsense because you're an adult.
Baby snow owl.
He's right.
Our spirit animals connect us to the natural world.
You need to remain open to their message.
Watch.
Welcome back, old friend.
Whoa.
If you really want to cleanse yourself of that anger, take that check and send it into the flames.
And up into the air with your screams.
Do not burn that check.
It is money.
No.
Ron is right, Ron.
There, there, baby snow owl.
You're safe now.
This is him right here.
I'll also get out here and walk home.
You sure?
This thing runs on vegetable oil and bat guano.
Actually cleans the air as it drives.
Quite sure.
Thank you.
Hey.
Thank you for helping me with my anger.
You've already emerged from your cocoon.
Now the question is, will you fly?
Yeah, I don't feel any better.
I'm still angry.
Damn it.
I don't know why this lake house thing is driving me so crazy.
Sorry we couldn't help you work through your problems.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a lady, two little girls, and an infant waiting for me.
It's always nice to see the kids at the end of a long day.
Really puts things in perspective.
Oh, my God.
Ben, I have so much to tell you.
We got Land Ho to play the Unity Concert.
Whoa, what happened to you?
It doesn't matter.
I thought I was upset because my parents are insane.
But Ron kind of just showed me the real reason.
I have so many childhood memories at that lake house that, in the back of my mind, I always pictured taking my kids, or taking our kids there.
I want to start our family.
I mean, I know things are crazy, but there's no good time.
And I want to do it.
Now.
Well, buddy, I've got some good news for you.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
So what do we got so far?
We need big-ticket items.
I got the Red Hot Chili Peppers to send us a signed guitar.
That's great, April.
How'd you do that?
It's a long story, but the short version is, I'm currently catfishing Anthony Kiedis.
We're throwing a charity auction to raise money for the unity concert, and we're gonna need it too, if I'm gonna perform Islands In the Stream with a Sacagawea hologram.
Plus, we need lights, generators, microphones, water, that boring stuff too.
Why don't we put a pin in this?
'Cause we have to do that thing.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, okay.
- All right, yep.
- Just, like-- Everybody, keep working.
We'll be back.
Andy, hey, you haven't told anyone about the baby, right?
No, but my brain is about to explode from stress.
I am not good at keeping secrets.
That's exactly what I told Kyle when he told me his wife was cheating on him.
- Andy, come on!
- Ah!
See?
Oh!
- Not cool, man.
- Not him, not that Kyle.
Okay, we are going to have a doctor's appointment, and then after that, we can probably tell people.
So just hang in there, please.
I can do this.
People do this.
People keep secrets.
My neighbor Eric-- he's kept a secret for 20 years.
He's in Witness Protection.
Okay.
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.
I need to ask you for a favor.
What?
Ron Swanson asking for help?
Keep your voice down, woman!
Part of the unity concert is a youth revue about the history of Pawnee.
They require volunteers, so I want you to come with me to my daughters' public elementary school to help make costumes.
The elementary school.
I'll do you this solid, but you're gonna have to keep an eye out for my ex-boyfriend Joe.
He teaches music at that school, and he is a nightmare.
- He's my Tammy.
- Your Tammy?
Donna, my two ex-wives are the worst people in the world.
Tammy two once seduced a coroner and had me declared legally dead just so she could get a discount on a plane ticket.
When I'm with Joe, he turns me into a person I don't like or recognize.
I go insane.
All I'm asking is for you to keep him away from me.
I understand this problem well and agree to this exchange of services.
We need to raise a minimum of $30,000 from the auction, or else the concert's gonna be in trouble.
What else can we auction off?
What about those fish?
Think they're valuable?
Cover me.
Maybe you should start taking it easy.
You're stressing out for two now.
Hmm, that's actually a pretty decent t-shirt idea.
Babe, I cannot slow down.
The concert is in three weeks.
Look, I feel fine, and if you're worried, we can just ask Dr. Saperstein what he thinks.
Someone say "Saperstein"?
Come on, you two.
Let's saddle you up and put some jelly on the belly.
- He's a little weird.
- Mm-hmm.
- Look at me!
- Jeez.
Okay, here's what's happening--I want to auction off a personalized Johnny Karate song tomorrow, so I need you to come to the auction.
Auction?
Okay, yeah.
Let me write that down.
Andy, you already have three Johnny Karate shows tomorrow.
No, not according to my file here.
Oh, I forgot, other hand.
Crap.
Okay, we need a better system.
Look, I'll just write down an itinerary for you, so you can just focus on songs.
Okay, well, you have to catalog all this stuff.
I mean, this is hours' worth of work.
What is that?
"Don't tell secret"?
Oh, no, that's not one.
Andy, if you have a secret, you have to tell me.
That's the whole point of marriage.
You get twice the secrets.
Dude, it is nothing.
I don't have anything.
I'm not acting weird.
You're acting weird.
Excuse me.
I have to get back to work now.
What are you doing?
I'm getting a picture of you volunteering at a public elementary school in case I ever need to blackmail you.
That's Joe, 12:00.
Donna, how are you?
- It's really nice to see you.
- Mm-hmm.
Thank you so much for helping out.
These kids are so lucky to have your fashion expertise.
Hello, Joe.
My name is Ron Swanson.
I am Donna's work-proximity associate.
Oh, my gosh, Donna has told me so much about you.
It's nice to put a face to the name.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I gotta get back to my classroom.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ron.
And if either of you guys need anything at all today, please do not hesitate to ask, okay?
- I'm onto you, friend.
- What?
Tread lightly.
Okay.
Now, Ben wants me to slow down, but I have this huge project coming up, and slowing down isn't really my jam.
Your body is going through some changes, but you're a healthy gal, right, Leslie?
There is no reason for you not to be yourself.
I win.
- It wasn't a competition.
- All right.
Let's see what's going down in baby town.
There's your healthy baby.
Oh, wow.
Oh, and there's another one.
The baby has two bodies?
Twins.
Ben, we're having twins.
No, you're not, 'cause look who's hiding over here.
Triplets?
Triplets?
And here's a fourth.
I'm so sorry, no.
It's a little fleck of cream cheese on the screen.
Just triplets.
Wow, you guys really dodged a bullet.
Can you imagine raising four children at one time?
Ha, a nightmare.
- Triplets.
- Triplets.
I can't believe it.
We knocked it out of the park on the first try.
If we do this right, we can be parents to 1/3 of the supreme court!
- This is insane.
- This is amazing.
I always knew we were one in a million, and now we got the proof!
Well, actually, one in 8,000.
Triplets occur a lot more frequently than you imagine, - especially at your age.
- Oh.
Your body is prone to releasing multiple eggs.
It's what we doctors like to call-- and I don't mean to be insensitive-- a going-out-of-business sale.
So, doctor, um, what do we-- like, what do we do?
Like, what do we do?
Um, how do we-- how--how--how-- how-- what do we do?
The first thing you do is, you forget everything that I said before because you, young lady, need a lot of rest and especially avoiding stress.
Leslie, I need you to be Buddha on quaaludes, and, Ben, you are Matthew McConaughey in a hammock on the beach.
All right, all right.
All right.
This is insane.
Three kids?
I just multiplied all our future expenses by three, and you know what happened?
The numbers got a lot higher.
I think I heard the computer laugh at me.
And Saperstein wants us to relax?
Are you ready to go, my gentle dove?
Oh, I will be there in two flaps of a butterfly's wing, and I love you.
We are so screwed.
Uh-oh.
What did you do now, Joe?
Thank you so much.
We thought we were gonna have to tell Dylan that his doggie was gone forever.
Oh, my gosh.
Barbara, don't even mention it.
Look, I hate it when my students are upset, so I just went out, driving around.
I checked a few neighborhood parks.
It took barely six hours.
Oh, how can we ever repay you?
No need.
Would you like a muffin?
I made them last night.
It's the best muffin I've ever had.
You're welcome, guys.
You're welcome.
Oh.
So whose birthday is it anyway?
Oh, who knows?
I got so many kids from different women, I just get all of their birthdays out of the way one day a year.
Ladies.
Okay, so when this ends, we have a half hour to get to the next party.
That gives us and 15 minutes for you to take a wet-nap shower in the car.
- Good, I need one.
- Also, tell me your secret.
Babe, don't make me tell.
I don't wanna break my promise.
Tell me now.
Oh, jeez, this is heavy.
Pardon me.
It's about Larry.
He is very sick.
He has some kind of disease.
Oh, so that's why you've been so nice to him and let him carry all your stuff.
Yes, that's the reason.
Good call, babe.
Jeez.
Poor guy.
Hello, everyone.
Thank you all for coming to this wonderful and calm event.
Our first item up for bid is two all-access V.I.P. passes to the unity concert.
Let's start the bidding at $40.
Do I hear 40?
Thank you.
40.
We can beat this.
50.
Anyone for 50?
$50.
Thank you, sir.
Terrific.
Any higher?
No?
Well, that's fine.
We're all just calm and happy people enjoying ourselves together on earth.
Sold for $50.
How magnificent.
Leslie, that's less than face value.
You need passion, zeal, showmanship.
I don't have the gavel, so I'm powerless.
I respect the hierarchy of the auction!
I think Leslie's doing a great job.
Thank you, Craig.
Hey, are you doing all right?
- Yeah.
- You want to do some tai chi?
- No, I'm doing really fine.
- Okay.
Leslie is already the queen of stress, so I have to be like her stress shamwow.
I wrap myself around her, I soak up all of her stress, and then after the kids are born, someone can squeeze me out into a bucket.
- Ron!
- Ron!
Ron, play with us!
- Okay.
- Ron, play with us.
Girls, Ron's got sharp tools now.
- Oh, Ron!
- Ladies.
Eyes are watching, ears are listening lips are closed, hands are still feet are very quiet you should really try it, listen well, listen well That was well played.
Children their age respond positively to melody and rhyme.
They are great girls.
You must feel very lucky to be their stepdad.
I do, indeed.
If you'll excuse me, Joe, I have to finish hogging out the cheeks on these lap joints.
Oh, maybe you could use this jig I made.
It's just a hardwood clamping block connected to a small piece of hackberry.
You could use it to locate your cuts for the inside shoulder Without having to reset the fence.
Exactly.
Muffin?
Thirsty there, big guy?
Well, jeez, yes.
Thank you so much.
Do you remember the time when you put sleeping pills in my soda?
I fell right over in the middle of a town hall meeting.
Mm, no.
I don't remember that.
You made a video of it and showed it at my birthday party.
Yes, it went over really big.
Well, I'm sorry.
Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
That's very sweet.
Yeah, um, I have got an itch that I have not been able to get to all day, and even against the wall, nothing will do it.
- Would you mind doing that?
- No, not at all.
Just--if you could, like-- okay, go up.
Go up the back.
Hey, Ben.
Can I just please tell just April?
I am hanging on by a thread over here.
No, just--look, everyone's healthy and fine, but it's complicated.
There's a lot going on.
So just don't say anything to anyone about anything forever, okay?
Andy?
You can say "Okay".
Okay.
Bye.
I didn't mean to say "Bye".
Our next item up for bid is the naming rights for our children's tent, so let's start the bidding at $1,000, please.
I'll bid 100 bucks.
Anyone want to-- Oh, thank you, madam.
A very wealthy and elegant-looking woman with a diamond-encrusted eye patch just raised her hand.
Don't look at her.
She doesn't like attention, but she's there.
She's real.
So do I hear 2,000?
Ooh, yeah, here we go.
The sheik has thrown his hat into the ring.
- Well - There's no sheik.
It looks like we've got a real bidding war between There's no bidding war.
No one's talking - An elegant-- - 'Cause there's no sheik, and there's no old lady with a diamond-- what is it, a diamond eye patch?
- 3,000, says the gentleman - There's no 3,000.
With the crazy hat and a monkey on his shoulder.
- It's 100 bucks.
It's my bid.
- That is outrageous.
That's the only bid out there right now.
Naming rights for the kids' tent go to Jamm Orthodontics for 100 smackers.
Now that is the steal of the day.
I think it's going great.
You want a head massage?
Okay.
So, um, Andy told me what's going on.
Really?
Oh.
I was trying to keep it hush-hush.
It's kind of embarrassing.
Well, if you ever need to talk to anyone, I'm here for you.
Or, like, you know, I'm here, standing near you.
Well, earlier today, I was licking icing off of my finger, and then, boom, I swallow my wedding ring.
And I wish I could say it was the first time, but-- Wait, wait, wait.
So you're not, like, dying?
No, no, no, I mean, can it be painful?
Sure, but the good news is, I've gotten very good at passing it.
It's just a matter of getting out the old colander.
Come on, Pearl, jump in.
Don't make me pull the permits on your rental units.
Hey, all the paperwork on those buildings are under my dog's name, so if you got a problem, take it up with Princess.
Honey, why don't you take a whale-sounds break, okay?
I'll finish this up.
Guys, come on, now.
This is signed by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Just think about all their great songs, covering everything from the culture of Southern California to drug use in Southern California.
- I'll bid 30 bucks.
- Okay.
This is easily worth $500.
Come on.
Please, anyone.
We're just trying to raise some money for this concert, - so no one gets stressed out.
- Fine.
for Old Herman.
Why would you erase the signatures?
I'm more of a Jack Johnson guy.
Okay, give it back.
If you want it so bad, bid on it.
I don't like the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
It's not even the original lineup.
Give it back!
Ben!
It's okay.
I'm fine.
Stay relaxed.
Oh, my God, there's blood everywhere.
Call a doctor!
No, call a coroner!
It just got insane!
You have very weak hands.
Why would you say that?
Just making an observation.
Poor Ben.
You know the EMT said that if flea had sent you his bass, you could've lost a thumb.
I'm totally fine, babe.
Everything is a-okay coolio beans.
- You want to meditate real quick?
- No, we do not have time.
We have a concert to save.
Excuse me, he's feeling better.
He can go, right, Ann?
Damn it.
I wonder if I'll ever stop doing that.
Come on.
I honestly don't care, but I'm just gonna say it.
I like Joe.
He's a nice man who's good with kids, and he seems to be smart and patient.
I know.
That's why he's my Tammy.
I'm a social butterfly.
When we're together, all we do is have sex, sit on the couch, eat homemade pasta, - have sex again.
- Enough.
He's constantly being respectful, wanting to spend time with me, trying to "connect" with me.
It's a nightmare.
I become boring.
Live your life how you want, but don't confuse drama with happiness.
So I've been talking to Larry, and he's definitely not dying.
Technically, we're all dying, unless you choose the right grail.
It's the dusty one.
Andy, I was nice to Larry.
I scratched his back.
I had a conversation with him.
It was horrible.
How can you do that to me?
Fine.
I'll tell you the secret.
- Ben's dog is dying.
- Lie.
Ben is dying--he has the same disease Larry has.
- Leslie is dying.
- No.
- They're both dying.
- No.
I'm dying.
- Chris and Ann are moving.
- They already moved.
They're moving again to Chinatown in France.
- No!
- Okay, fine.
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.
- Leslie is a spy.
- No.
Tom has something wrong with his butt.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
Did you hear that?
They need an encore.
Honey, they want--the kids want an encore, I'm sorry.
What song should we do?
You wanna do Toots?
I hope you don't mind, but I noticed that your right rear tire was a little flat, so I patched it, and I inflated it for you.
But you're still gonna want to go to a garage 'cause I don't-- - I like to do things.
- Excuse me.
Museums, opera, nightclubs.
Sometimes I disappear for a day or two 'cause I'm fly-fishing or I'm at a Seattle Sounders game.
I promise not to cheat on you if you promise not to try to pin me down too fast.
I have no problem with that.
You can take me to dinner Friday.
I have only one request-- that you wear that, uh, red thing.
I'll wear that red thing when you deserve to see me in that red thing.
Gotta go make some muffins.
Okay, there's still plenty of ways to raise money for the concert, right?
Maybe we'll win the lottery.
I mean, hey, you're looking at a woman who just hit triple cherries in her uterus.
We're screwed.
No, we're not, we have three weeks until the concert.
- It'll be fine.
- No, not the concert.
The triple cherries.
I mean, of course it's the most amazing and wonderful thing to ever happen, but, okay, I am an accountant, and I am looking a cold, hard facts.
Raising three kids is going to cost $2 million.
Babe, our kids will be geniuses.
They'll get scholarships.
Half of my tuition was paid for by the Indiana scholarship for pretty blondes who like to read.
It's now called the Virginia Woolf prize--different time.
Leslie, I have been trying so hard not to stress you out, but we just spent our entire savings account on a trip to Paris.
What were we thinking?
We spent too much money on macaroons.
Okay, honey-- Okay, wait, what's the number for the Louvre?
I mean, maybe I can get a refund.
We barely looked at the Mona Lisa.
Honey, can you just breathe for a second?
Leslie, these numbers are going to determine everything for the rest of our lives!
- Breathe.
- I mean, maybe we should move because we could make more money, or maybe we should stay here because it's cheaper to live here than in Chicago.
Oh, my God!
I'm shamwowing all of your stress, and there's no one here to wring me out.
- Benjamin Wyatt - I don't even know-- The man of my dreams, the one that I love, shh.
Leslie, we are in trouble here.
We are in real trouble!
- I'm so sorry.
- What?
You just look so crazy right now, but cute.
You're always stressed out.
How are you calm right now?
Because I realized something.
Everything that we have been through-- the harvest festival, the election, the recall, the merger, Ann leaving, Larry changing his name for some stupid reason-- all of it has just been preparation for this.
I am immune to stress because I have you.
Come on.
I have an idea.
Ron is King Sparkle of Cupcake Forest.
Much obliged.
So I'm going to dinner with Joe next week.
Glad to hear it.
It's always nice to see someone actually change for the better.
Yes, Joe seems like a good man, but at this point, I'm done talking about him.
I was talking about you.
Your family has made you a more patient and empathetic person.
- You take that back.
- Come on, Swanson.
Did you think even two years ago you'd be playing matchmaker for me while wearing a glittery crown?
Now you're a dad.
You care a little, itty bit about your friends.
You're King Sparkle of Cupcake Forest.
It suits you.
Andy, the camo is not working.
I can see you.
- Damn, really?
- Yes.
Babe, you don't have to hide from me.
I don't care about the secret anymore, okay?
I just thought, when we got married, we would share everything, but if you really can't tell me or whatever, it's fine.
I trust you.
It's just that it's a really big secret, and for once, I wanted to keep my word.
But screw it.
You're more important than anything.
I'm gonna tell you 'cause it's super juicy-- you ready?
Okay.
Everybody, if you could gather around They're here--don't try to get it out of me anymore.
The reason I have been acting so weird is not because I've been waiting for the results of the soil samples to come back.
Well, jeez, I've been up all night trying to make sure-- It doesn't matter, Larry.
It was a pointless ruse designed to waste time.
The truth is I'm pregnant.
Yes, I did it!
I kept a secret.
Congratulations.
I'm sure you will both raise a wonderful child with whom I will profoundly disagree on nearly everything.
Well, actually, and this is crazy, but it's children, plural.
- We're having triplets, and - Shut the-- - Oh, my God!
- A little freaked out about it.
That's amazing.
Babe, I am so glad you didn't tell me.
I know.
I'm incredible.
Okay, now listen to me, you two.
Gayle and I have kept everything our girls ever used, so we have, like, millions of clothes and strollers and-- - just don't buy a thing, okay?
- A triple crib-- sounds like an interesting woodworking challenge.
Would you like oak or pine?
I'll make both, and you can choose.
My boyf-- my friend Joe has the hookup at all the good preschools.
Andy and I can babysit anytime, except for on weekends and nights, but we're free anytime during work hours.
This is gonna be the happiest time of your life!
Well, I sold everything on the auction list, no thanks to you people.
What's so wonderful that you're all celebrating while I do all the hard work?
We're having triplets.
Oh, great.
First my cousin Winona gets into a car accident the night my one-man show opens, and now this?
Why are my accomplishments always overshadowed?
Congratulations, I suppose.
That's nice of him.
- Yeah, yeah, I'll take that.
- Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Whoa, Alcatraz.
Can't believe Michael Bay spent a billion dollars of his own money to build that for The Rock.
I can't believe you were able to recite that entire movie from memory on the plane ride.
You weren't trying to sleep, were you?
I couldn't tell, 'cause you had that mask thing over your eyes.
This may be the craziest week of my entire life.
I am six days away from the start of the Unity concert.
I am pregnant with triplets.
I am trying to decide if I should take a job that will move me away from Pawnee, and I am speaking at the National Parks conference in San Francisco.
It is gonna be so much fun.
Michelle Obama is the keynote speaker, and you know what they say, "What happens at a national parks conference Is compiled and emailed to you in a PDF the following Monday".
We got to find a way to break in there.
They give tours.
Yeah.
That's exactly how they'll be expecting me to try to break in.
My restaurant opens in six weeks, and I'm making sure I get every detail right.
This is the hardest I've worked on anything since Wow.
I've never worked hard on anything.
What a cool life!
Looks like everything's on track for July.
It's just too bad we're not opening in time for this Unity concert.
The extra publicity would've given us a nice boost.
Why don't we?
We could do a soft opening tomorrow and be ready just in time for the concert crowd.
You really think you can pull that off?
Well, nobody can predict the future except me.
I guarantee it'll work and in six months, this place will be bigger than McDonald's.
As always, I love your enthusiasm.
See you tomorrow, partner.
A soft opening tomorrow?
From now on, everyone call me Kristin, because I am wigging out right now!
Yeah, we're not even close to being ready.
They're not even done painting that sign.
It says, "Tom's Bi".
Actually, no, that's good.
We're ready.
Mitch is right.
The amount of buzz we get from opening next weekend is too big to pass up.
We can do it.
"This little Italian restaurant will put McDonald's out of business" on three.
One, two, three.
- Dark Lord rise - This little Italian restaurant - will be bigger than McDonald's!
- In hell fire.
"Lester Kanopf"?
Come on, guys, get it together.
That's mine.
- Sorry, Lester.
- Yours is right here.
Grant, hi.
Yeah, I saw you were gonna be here, and since you've been ducking my calls, I just thought that I'd drop in.
- Care to join me for lunch?
- I I would Liam Bonneville's gonna be there.
Liam Bonneville the department of the interior's resident bad boy?
Well, now you've got my attention.
Let me go grab my autograph book, and we'll head out.
Andy and I are meeting with a tech company called "Gryzzl".
Now, they're giving away free wi-fi to a few cities across America, and we're going to pitch Pawnee to them.
And what exactly does Gryzzl do?
Well, "It's the cloud for your cloud".
No idea.
Wow.
So Gryzzl's really taken off, huh?
Uh, yeah, it's been a crazy ride.
Our music service, Gryzzldump, launched in November, and now we have 170 million users.
Six months ago, I was working in a taco truck.
Now I own one-third of the Portland trail blazers.
You know, I think Pawnee is a great candidate for your free-wireless initiative.
We lead the country in online pizza ordering.
In fact, a lot of people go to the library just to order pizza online.
Right now we're kind of focused on, like, bigger cities, like Shreveport, Akron.
Sure.
Obviously, we're no Akron.
I mean, we're more like Dayton.
But with your help, we can become Toledo.
Ben, we don't like to say the word "no" - No.
- At this company.
We feel it's counterproductive to our creative mission, so, instead, let me say "Nah, bro".
How is that better?
Dwayne "the Rock" Swanson.
Donna told me I'd find you up here.
- What's all this?
- Over the last few months, I've remodeled the entire third floor wiring, heating and cooling, restored this red pine back to its original glory.
Oh, wow.
The stripes are so wavy.
It's really all right, I can't keep this facade up any longer.
I need a favor.
You know those chairs you were making for my restaurant?
- I need 'em now.
- I was told I had until July.
My chairs take time.
Who do you think I am, Thomas Hucker?
Please, Ron?
I've never asked you for anything today.
All right.
I'll get to work right away.
Please, you're really far behind.
Hello, everybody.
This is Leslie Knope.
- Leslie, this is Rebecca - Varuvian, yes, hello.
I ow who you are.
I've read all of your papers and I had your poster on my wall when I was a kid.
- What poster?
- I made a poster of you by blowing up your picture from the national parks newsletter.
I cut out your face and made it look like you were dunking over Charles Barkley.
- My God.
- So you're the author of the famous river cleanup proposal, huh?
It wasn't bad.
Liam Bonneville read my proposal.
Wow.
Liam's being withholding, as usual.
That proposal was brilliantly written.
Rebecca Varuvian.
- Yes?
- Nothing.
That was the best lunch I ever had.
I have to see the photos that you took.
- I didn't take any photos.
- What?
Grant, come on.
Leslie, you're treating those people like they're your heroes.
They could be your peers.
Look, I really hope you take the job, but we're at the end of the line here.
- I need a decision by tomorrow.
- Okay, that's fair.
I mean, I would be insane not to take the job, but I'm just having some trouble thinking about leaving Pawnee.
Hey, here's someone who may be able to convince you.
Hello, Mrs. Obama.
- Hey, Grant.
How you doing?
- Oh.
Doing good.
This is Leslie Knope.
She's considering a job with us running the new Midwest Bureau in Chicago.
Well, you know how I feel about Chicago.
Ah, you are from Chicago, so you like it!
That's right, and we need passionate people like you on our national parks.
You know, they get hundreds of millions of visitors each year.
Are you nodding because you agree with me?
Yes, I do agree with you.
I agree with you on all things throughout history until the end of time, forever.
- You and Grant work together?
- Yeah, we work together a lot.
He's helped me integrate the "Let's Move" program into our national parks you know, getting kids outside, rock climbing, hiking.
Wow!
That's really, really incredible!
Great work!
I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!
I'm getting louder now, and I can't stop!
My apologies!
Just I don't know.
I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!
- Just can I high-five you?
- Yeah.
Well I hope you take the job.
Change happens one person at a time.
Good to meet you.
Again, think it over.
- Okay, this is a bad idea.
- Just trust me.
You got your camera ready?
Yeah, Andy, I'm very nervous about this.
You're gonna hurt yourself.
And here we go.
Wow!
Look at it go!
I mean, I knew it'd go down, but not that fast!
Oh-ho!
San Francisco's the best.
Huh.
I thought he was go.
Yeah.
Anyway I've decided.
I'm gonna take the job.
There's so much more in the world to see, and I feel like I can really make a difference.
Oh, and I met Michelle Obama.
What?
Why didn't you lead with that?
I don't know!
Liam Boneville has me in a tizzy.
Guys!
It's totally broken!
We have ten tables booked for the soft opening.
It's all friends and family, so hopefully they'll go easy on us.
How's it looking, Ron?
Maybe speed it up a little?
This is not government work.
As such, I treat it with care and attention.
Okay, but also, go faster.
I haven't had time to hire a staff yet, so, April, you'll handle service.
No!
Can't I just stay in the back and spit in people's food like we planned?
Ugh!
The sawdust from Ron's chairs is everywhere!
My sinuses are on the Fritz, and smell is 90% of taste, maybe 95%!
Okay, Craig, Donna's gonna be your wine taster.
You guys will work as a team.
Fine, but if he raises his voice once once I'm out.
Please don't stick to that policy.
- I got the menus.
- Great.
Larry, what the hell?
What are these pictures?
Aw, jeez, I must have given the printer the wrong flash drive.
What is this, a rotten grapefruit?
No, it's my dog's rectum.
Lord Sheldon has a growth, so we're sending pictures over to the vet.
But I guess this isn't good for menus, is it?
Larry, Larry, Larry, listen to me.
This is the worst thing you've ever done.
I need you to take all of these dog-butt pictures and burn them in the pizza oven.
April, you list all the menu items from memory.
It'll be classier anyway.
Ron!
What was wrong with that one?
It was too perfect.
It looked machine-made.
Okay, we have to convince 'em that Pawnee is a special city.
Ooh, we could tell 'em that there's buried treasure in Pawnee.
And then after they give us the free wi-fi, we tell 'em that the treasure was love all along.
No.
I am not gonna take "no" for an answer.
If we're leaving Pawnee, I'm gonna give 'em a going-away present free wi-fi for all.
Every time someone in Pawnee clicks through a slideshow of American music award red-carpet side-boob fails, they'll say, "Thank you, Ben Wyatt".
What the hell?
They're playing Cones of Dunshire.
Hey, you invented that game.
Are they playing any games I invented?
Are they throwing dirt into a fan?
The key is, you have to throw the dirt - into the back of the fan.
- How the hell did they Excuse me.
How did you guys get your hands on this game?
Someone sent it to us.
Have you played it?
I invented Cones of Dunshire.
You're the architect.
Yeah, right, and I'm the Alchemist of the Hinterlands.
There can't be an Alchemist of the Hinterlands.
The Hinterlands is a Shadongdom that can only sustain a provost or a denier.
- He's right.
- Hey, how about this?
Let's play.
If I win, you give me another shot at free wireless for Pawnee.
Have a seat.
You want to be corporal - or warrior?
- Neither.
I'm the Maverick.
By using the Leslie Knope seamless merger supesystem patent pending Pawnee and Eagleton and their parks departments will be fully integrated within the next 6 to 12 months.
I know, I know.
I think it was a good presentation too.
Is that why you're laughing?
Your timeline is way off.
I was in charge of the Wesham/Southborough merger of 2004.
You know when it was completed?
Last month.
What?
How is that possible?
Merging governments requires constant hands-on management.
You're being very cavalier about the future of your town.
Excuse me.
I've been accused of lot of things, but cavalier has never been one of them.
I have a super system.
I had a system too, but the economy went South.
My hometown hit some hard times and was converted into unincorporated territory.
You lost your cityhood?
If you want to see this through, you need eight to ten years minimum, unless you want to run the risk of Pawnee becoming - Don't say it.
- Unincorporated territory.
It's a bold flavor fruity, a little earthy.
Well, which is it fruity or earthy?
It can't be both.
They're mutually exclusive!
Oh, no!
You do not come at me like that.
I'm sorry.
I don't know who I am anymore.
A man without a palate isn't a man.
I love you, Donna.
What are you guys doing?
There's people waiting out there!
We're having a moment, you monster!
Ugh!
- Stop hassling me.
- Ron, you're amazing.
You've always been like a grandpa to me, but can you please lower your standards a tiny bit so my customers have somewhere to sit?
No.
Oh!
I am so sorry, Tom.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but don't worry about it.
Restaurant superstition breaking a glass on the first night is good luck.
Oh, thank God.
Oh, jeez.
Play an action card, build a bell tower inside your citadel.
My shaman casts a toyber spell on your prosperity tile.
Looks like someone's out of resource gems.
Uh-oh.
What's so funny?
Oh, no, no, no, you're a smart guy, clearly picked up some flashy tricks, but you made one crucial mistake.
You forgot about the essence of the game.
It's about the Cones.
Move my abbot to the ocean hex, which moves my Brinksman to the Devil's Lair, and pushes my farmer yes, my humble farmer directly into the central cone.
Yeah, babe, we did it.
This whole company is ours.
Oh, no, it's not.
- That's mine, it's all mine.
- Andy for the record, I did invent this game.
But it doesn't even matter, because I won and I get another chance to prove that there's something truly special about Pawnee.
Yes, there is.
It's the home of the architect.
Let's talk.
I'm on top of the world.
Andy, what are you doing?
Seems like things are a little chaotic.
No, no, everything is perfect.
This is April.
She's gonna be taking care of you tonight.
Hello, welcome to Tommy's Bistro.
Today we have spaghetti, linguini, butercini, ravioli, rigattoni, lasagna.
Could you repeat that?
Spaghetti, linguini, butercini, ravioli, Ferrari, Lamborghini, rigattoni, lasagna.
Can I see a menu?
We had to throw our menus away because they are covered with pictures of Larry's dog rectum.
Great news.
Lord Sheldon's gonna make it.
Yeah, just have to apply a salve to his anus every hour for the rest of his life, but Oh, enjoy your meal.
- For crying out loud!
- No, Mitch, don't leave.
Come on.
You have no idea how to run a restaurant.
I've been in this game before and I can see the cracks starting to form.
Sorry, kid, consider my investment terminated.
D, let's go.
- Sir, were you sitting in that chair?
- Yes, yes I was.
Why?
- No reason.
- Let's go!
Apparently, and I don't know how, but the game has spread.
I mean, it's all over the Internet Austin, Charlotte, San Diego.
I mean, people are playing with my Cones, babe.
That's great.
I'm just bummed I never copyrighted it.
Oh, I'll look into that, but at least because of it, Pawnee will get free wireless, and we can both move away with a clear conscience.
Uh-oh.
What's wrong?
I I can't leave Pawnee during a difficult merger that I'm responsible for.
I have to turn down the job.
Leslie, no.
You made up your mind yesterday.
You Michelle Obama.
I know, but I've been doing this for months.
The only thing that I am 100% positive on is that I want to stay and go.
I'm never gonna be able to decide.
I'm gonna be paralyzed by hypotheticals until I die here, in this minivan at the San Francisco airport.
Wait a second.
I have an idea.
Drive here.
So you screwed up a little.
You tried to shoot the moon, and you came up short.
That doesn't mean it's over.
My main investor pulled out.
Any dollar I spend from now on is my own.
And despite what my pocket square says, I'm not a billionaire.
So I quit.
Just go home, Ron.
I'm not done with the chairs yet.
It is my belief that you never start a job you don't intend to finish.
Really?
I love quitting.
When I was a kid and things didn't go my way, I would just take my ball and go home.
That's better than winning, 'cause then your friends can't play anymore.
Hey!
- No, my stemware!
- You are not quitting.
I just called a bunch of reviewers, and I told them that the soft opening went great, and I invited them to come here on Friday.
- Why would you do this to me?
- You worked really hard.
You owe it to yourself to give it a real shot, because you are smart and talented.
Well, I hate doing work, but I love being flattered, so maybe I'll give it another try.
- Good.
- It's a smart move, son.
- Thanks, Ron.
- Because you currently owe me $16,000 for the wood.
What?
- Where are we going?
- Oh, it's right up here.
Just trust me.
I'm on Endor.
These are the redwoods George Lucas used to create the forest moon of Endor.
Sorry.
That's not why we're here.
Well, that is a gorgeous view.
Yes, it is.
But don't look at that.
Look at this.
You've been thinking about this job in the abstract.
Focus on what it actually means.
We're standing in a national park that stretches 50 miles.
That's the Presidio over there.
It's a national park.
So is Alcatraz, and so are the redwoods we just walked through, by the way.
You take this job, places like this will be your office.
Well, that is a compelling point.
When we got back from London, you said that it's a very big world and you've seen very little of it.
This is your chance, honey.
This whole region Mount Rushmore, the Badlands, the Ozarks, Abe Lincoln's childhood home you would be in charge of all of it.
Your job would be to preserve the most beautiful places on earth so millions of people could enjoy them.
And those places, the greatest treasures America has to offer, will all have signs with your name right there.
Hi, Grant.
I want the job.
I have a lot of questions, but I'm a little amped up right now, so I'll probably just hang up.
It might be for the best.
But, anyway, I love you.
No, I don't.
I'm sorry.
That was weird.
Okay, bye.
Oh, this is Lester Kanopf.
No, you know who it - Okay, bye.
- Smoothly handled, Lester.
I panicked.
We should go.
We have a lot of stuff to do and the meter's still running on that cab, so chop-chop.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Oh.
The opening of Tom's Bistro was a disaster.
So what?
This is America.
And America's the land of second chances, and now we have one night, one after-party to make the world realize that Tom's Bistro is where miracles can happen!
Thomas, I have to work all day at the Unity concert.
If you're gonna pull this off, we need more people.
I know, and I didn't want to do this, but I called in some reinforcements.
Did someone call for a party zoo?
Yum, yum, yum, yum.
All right, so we got a four-way going with my ex, my brother, and this rando?
Okay, if that's where the night is going - It's 9:00 in the morning - Wha It's not a four-way.
And I need your help.
Take these V.I.P. invitations.
Find all the "A" -list peeps at the concert and get 'em to the restaurant tonight.
I got to stop by the Parks office.
I'll meet you later.
Godspeed.
I like your energy, hombre.
What do you say you and I ride go-karts later?
I want to go horseback riding!
Deal.
Last chance, Ron.
The slots are finalized, but I can squeeze in ten minutes if a certain mister Duke Silver wanted to come out.
Come on, Ron, it's gonna be so fun.
Thank you, Andrew, but fun or not, playing music is something I like to keep private, along with my family, my conversations, and my whereabouts at all times.
Okay, everyone, welcome to the very last Unity concert planning meeting.
Andy, you are in charge.
This is your show.
Take it away.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to accept the following missions.
- Madison.
- Manning that art tents.
- Donna.
- Scheduling and security liaison.
- Larry.
- Staying out of the way.
And all of the rest of the volunteer-work assignments are up on this board.
Your main goal today is to get 2,000 people to sign up for the Pawnee-Eagleton merger preservation volunteer action squad.
Their first project will be to come up with a shorter name for the group.
You're right.
The name is too long.
I was picturing bigger hats.
- All right, here we go.
- Everybody, let's get to work.
Can the Parks and Rec people hang back for a second?
Um The reason I wanted you guys to stick around is, I wanted to tell you - That I love and admire you.
- Oh!
Leslie, thank you.
You say that every morning.
A while ago, I was offered a job at the national parks service, and it's a great opportunity, but it means that I'll have to move to Illinois.
And I took the job.
- Good for you!
- Wow!
- That's great!
- Congratulations, Knope.
The sentimental people in this office will probably miss you.
- When do you leave?
- Soon, maybe a month.
Oh.
That makes what we're about to show you a little bit awkward.
We had a new founders day statue commissioned and added your name to the list of founders of Pawnee.
Because you basically founded this new town.
Leslie Knope, champion of the Pawnee-Eagleton merger, "our most faithful citizen.
She never abandoned us".
- Oh, boy.
- There's a quote too.
"'Only a moron would ever live anywhere other than Pawnee, Indiana.
' Leslie Knope, multiple occasions".
I can cut a new plinth with a less ironic inscription.
This is so touching, you guys.
I am crying out of happiness and sadness and gratitude and because I'm carrying triplets and for a fifth reason that I can't figure out.
Leslie, don't cry.
It's not that great.
It doesn't even look like you.
Or, actually, you know what?
It kind of does.
Well, it's about that time.
Unity concert!
Hello, Pawnee.
We're The Decembrists.
It's great to be here in support of this event.
This is truly an amazing town.
I ordered a small cheeseburger, and both the buns were pizzas.
each feather it fell from skin Joanie baby, I'm throwing a huge party tonight at Tom's Bistro.
- You gots to stop by.
- You gots to stop by.
Will this medium drink of water be there?
The only reason I wouldn't be there is if I got pulled over For violating my house arrest Ah-boosh!
- What?
- Judge gave me two ankle bracelets, said it was the first time he ever had to do that.
Uh, jah boy's a question on the bar exam.
Yah-hey!
Anyway, Tom's Bistro, tonight, be there.
Uh-oh.
Okay.
Don't just let me talk Well, the relocation package seems fair, but the dental plan is more than fair.
I mean, three annual cleanings for the spouse?
Ka-ching.
Hey, did someone say "dental plan"?
How's it going?
Councilman Jeremy Jamm, Jamm orthodontics.
Hey, uh, I think we can all agree this concert blows, right?
You guys really want to see a crowd, you might want to stop by my secession rally later tonight.
That is gonna be off the hook!
- You ever heard of warrant?
- Yeah.
There's a cover band around here they call themselves "Cherry Pie".
Pretty sure we got their bass player.
- Oh, wow.
- Gonna be pretty good.
Dah-nah-nah, rock and roll, yeah, poison What is that?
Just general rock, man.
It's gonna be fun.
She's my cherry pie, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah - that guy was a councilman?
- Crazy, right?
Okay, uh, let's talk staff.
For the first few months, you're only gonna have six staffers.
Four of them will be coming up from Omaha.
Oh, so does that mean that there's two openings left?
- Yeah.
- Because I happen to know some of the most dedicated civil servants and greatest people to ever walk the planet earth.
You can hire whoever you like.
I will hang my head hang my head low, low, low Ginuwine, it is an honor to be breathing the same air as you.
No joke.
But real talk we're both men about town being constantly bombarded with party invitations.
Who is this guy?
My friend who's opening a restaurant tonight, and you're going to be there, cousin, unless you want me to get onstage and talk about how we used to take baths together, how you cried whenever I took away your rubber duckies.
Damn, Donna.
Why you got to bring the Quackson 5 into this?
How y'all doing?
Li'l Sebastian, this one is for you, because you're my pony.
I'm just a bachelor I'm looking for a partner someone who knows how to ride Ron, I have to ask you something, and I want you to consider it, okay?
Really consider it.
How would you feel about leaving Pawnee and moving to Chicago?
Hold on, come on, I'm not done.
You'd be working for the federal government.
You know what, excuse me for wanting my dear friend and ethical mentor to accompany me on the adventure of a lifetime.
It's very sweet, Leslie, and the national parks service is probably the only branch of government worth a damn, but Diane and I are quite happy raising our family here.
Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a booth over there serving something called, "fried sausage quilts," so I'm going to buy the booth.
Just once if I had the chance Hello.
I'm Johnny Karate.
Imaginary friends are cool imaginary friends take the fall for you - Daddy, you should play music.
- Yeah, Ron.
Go on.
Get up there.
Have some fun.
I recalibrated the sights on all the rifles in the shooting gallery.
I've had enough fun for one day.
Oh, I know that look.
Where is she?
She's near.
Hide the children.
Hello, Ron.
- Hello, Ron's friend.
- Tammy, what could possibly bring you to a children's performance preparing a ritual sacrifice of a newborn?
No, just trolling for some daddy.
Oh, sorry.
I pronounced that wrong.
Trolling for some dad "D".
Diane, why don't you take the girls for some ice cream while I dispose of this sewer-dwelling gutter witch?
Bye, Tammy.
Always a pleasure.
You're not fooling me, Ron.
This little domestic charade of yours hasn't changed you one bit.
You're still the same old Ron Swanson, and I will defeat you.
I will defeat you right into my pants.
- Thank you!
- Everybody go crazy!
All right, thanks, guys.
Remember karate on bad guys only.
Hey, man, you were really great out there.
Oh, hey, burly.
How you doing, man?
Pretty good, man.
Remember my nephew, Jack?
- He's a really big fan.
- Whoa, hey, Jack.
Good to see you, bud.
Hey, listen, man, I'm really sorry things ended so weird with mouse rat.
You know, that's not really how I pictured us - breaking up, you know.
- Yeah, I do know.
I always figured we'd you know, whatever break up 'cause I got drafted by the Colts.
And then in the first game, of course, I'd break my leg.
Crowd starts chanting my name, and I give 'em the thumbs-up.
And then I'd go to the hospital.
I'd get really good at chess.
I end up beating the computer finally, and then the band just sort of drifts apart.
- That was how I saw it, but - Yeah.
- Take it easy.
- Yeah, see you.
Babe, that was so awesome.
That was the best performance ever.
One kid peed his pants because he didn't want to miss anything.
- What?
I gave a kid pee pants?
- Yes!
Well, that's why I do what I do.
What's wrong?
I guess I just kind of miss having people up onstage with me.
They never tell you when you go solo that it's just gonna be you up there.
Anyways, what do you say I take you over to the ball pit, and we find your cell phone I lost?
You what?
Just living on a Sunday morning got my toast and tea, and I'm warm and I just thought I'd think about and it might be the comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky could never parallel the challenge of an acquion in the here and now, here and now I love you, Kay Hanley!
I hope you like deep-dish pizza, because there's gonna be a lot more of it in Chicago, where we're all gonna be moving.
- Okay.
- No.
No.
We are not moving to Chicago for, like, a billion reasons.
- But, babe, pizza.
- There's pizza in Pawnee.
Right.
Thanks, babe.
You're so good at reminding me where pizza is.
Come on, guys, take a risk.
Live on the edge.
Life is an adventure.
It is!
Let's do it!
- No.
- No.
Pawnee is cheap, and we like it here, and Chicago seems like there's a lot of stuff to do and people, but I like to do nothing with no one.
So thank you, and I love you, but, no, thank you, and I hate you.
I love you.
Well, you know, you owe me for that pizza.
But you're motoring Yeah motoring Sister Christian.
Thank you, Pawnee!
We have been Bobby Knight Ranger!
Super cool to hear Sister Christian that many times in a row.
Now is the moment we've all been waiting for.
This next band agreed to reunite for one night only, and it's gonna be great.
I personally hope that they play Summer Sun.
We all know how it goes, right?
Summer sun summer sun - Hey, Andy.
- * Summer * Why don't you let us play those, bud?
Oh, yeah, good point.
Okay.
Without any further ado, land ho!
What up, Pawnee?
alone and zoned and sad no one gives a zig or zag I should have let you ride I should have let you go Thank you, Pawnee!
You miss the band?
No, I mean, I love that I'm Johnny Karate now, but being part of a band, that's just that's rock and roll, man.
Joining us now for our finale, legendary local band, please welcome Mouse Rat!
You guys are closing this sucker down!
Well, how about this Unity concert, huh, Pawnee?
I love this town so much, and I'm just so proud to live here.
And we're gonna close tonight out with a tribute to Pawnee's greatest treasure.
Up in horsey heaven, here's the thing You trade your legs for angel's wings and once we've all said good-bye you take a running leap, and you learn to fly bye-bye, Li'l Sebastian I miss you in the saddest fashion Whoo!
bye-bye, Li'l Sebastian you're 5,000 candles in the wind Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Duke Ssilver!
bye-bye, Li'l Sebastian I miss you in the saddest fashion bye-bye, Li'l Sebastian you're 5,000 candles in the wind Guys, this is the most important night of my life, which means it's the most important night of your lives too.
Speak for yourself.
I once got into a cab that Kyra Sedgwick was getting out of.
No way, The Closer?
Oof!
It's opening night.
Let's do this!
Hey, butt wieners!
Look who I found - Daddy!
- No.
Your father ruined my last business.
Why would you bring him here?
Because you told me to look for V.I.P.s, and my daddy is the V.I.-est "P" I know.
- I love you, daddy.
- I love you too, angel.
Money, please.
- Mm!
Money!
Money!
Money!
- Money, please!
Craig, we're gonna drink.
Why would you come here, Saperstein?
I came here to see your flourishing business, to see how well you're doing.
Wow!
You're back.
Can you squeeze me in, or do I need a reservation?
'Cause there's nobody here.
Maybe this restaurant won't be a huge success.
Maybe it won't be packed with celebrities.
- Tommy!
- Or maybe it will.
- Hello, Joan.
Hello, Perd.
- Hi.
Thanks for coming by.
- Can I get you a drink?
- I'll have the Joan.
It's a tumbler of gin, and it's got crushed aspirin around the rim.
And I would just like an empty glass.
Steve, can we get these cocktails going for Joan and Perd?
Oh, look, Kay Hanley, rock star, thanks for coming by.
Thanks for having me.
Come on in, guys.
You might want to grab a seat, Dr. Saperstein.
Looks like it's getting a little crowded.
And I said, "you don't need a towel.
You need a washcloth".
You know, I don't think that the girls have ever been happier or more surprised than when you got up on that stage.
Well, having you and the kids in my life has made me a different person.
And I like it.
There's more room in my life for fun.
Hi, Ben.
It's me, Barney, from the accounting firm.
Yes.
Hi, Barney.
You don't have to introduce yourself every time.
I was gonna wait until your birthday to give this to you, but I'm just too excited.
This is the copyright to Cones of Dunshire.
After you gave it to us as a gift, we saw its potential, so we formed a "C" corp and registered it in your name.
This is amazing.
How can I ever repay you?
Come work for us at the accounting firm.
Okay.
Oh!
Oh!
No, sorry.
I can't.
Wow.
Shortest one yet.
Thank you.
Babe, thank you so much for organizing the mouse rat reunion.
It was actually Ginuwine who arranged everything.
He really cares about you.
You're the greatest wife ever.
I wish I could marry you all over again.
Let's get divorced.
That way, we can get married again.
Yes, let's do it.
- You want to?
- Yes!
We should do that, right?
Yeah, totally.
- We're getting divorced!
- Yes.
This is amazing.
Practically everyone we invited came, except for Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus.
I was hoping tonight would be magical enough - to get 'em back together.
- Let it go, friend.
He's not good enough for her, and vice versa!
Thomas.
Yes, we don't get along, but I look at you I see driven, I see smart, and I just had the best Italian meal I've ever had in my life, and I've been to Dallas.
- I'm in.
- No way.
I'm not gonna let you take another one of my businesses.
No, no, I'm in as a partner.
I'm always looking for new investments.
I've got an auto dealership.
I've got a massage parlor, a dry-cleaning transactional holding company that is doing unbelievably well, I might add.
What do you say?
You know what?
I'm not really looking for investors, given the almost embarrassing level of success I've attained, but I'll consider it.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get some pictures for my wall of fame.
Uh, excuse me, miss Hanley?
Do you mind if I snap a you-ie?
It's what I call selfies of other people.
Sure.
Can I get everyone's attention, please?
Our goal was to get 2,000 signatures in support of the merger.
We got almost 4,000 on the first night.
Hey, everybody, let's keep this party going.
The next round of gnocchi is on the house.
You look sad, Knope.
Couldn't find any takers for Chicago?
Everybody turned me down but Larry.
- Ouch.
- Yeah.
Well, cheer up.
You got a new job, new challenges, all that crap you like.
Man, I'm gonna miss Pawnee.
I wish I could stay, you know, keep an eye on it, raise my kids here.
And let's be honest, am I ever gonna find a better breakfast than JJ's Diner?
You will not, no.
I know it's not easy to leave, but this job does seem perfect.
Of course, I'd prefer you use your talents elsewhere.
You know, with your courage and small frame, you'd make an excellent coal miner.
Thank you, Ron.
That's very sweet.
It's time for you to move up in the world.
Your ambition was bound to take you away from the town you love sooner or later, and you can't have everything you want.
Oh, my God.
I can have everything I want!
- Thank you.
- I feel like - you're not listening to me.
- Oh, and by the way, don't think that we are not discussing Duke silver.
When were you going to tell me about that?
Unbelievable!
I am so furious at you, but I've already forgiven you, and you need to teach me how to play the saxophone.
Okay, bye.
Hi, Leslie and everyone.
- I'm Grant - No time for small talk.
I think the best version of me working as Midwest regional director is not in Chicago.
It's right here in Pawnee.
- How so?
- The financial savings here are enormous.
I mean, the cost of living is way lower here, and renting the entire third floor of this building would be way cheaper than a much smaller space in Chicago.
Pawnee is actually closer to most of the parks in the Midwest region, and it's got Tom's Bistro an exciting new-wave Italian eatery that's equal parts Dean Martin and Bruno Mars.
But that's just what The Indianapolis Star is saying.
Let's see what everyone else has to say.
No, no, this is not what we're doing right now.
- But congrats.
- Leslie should stay here.
And if you don't agree with us, it's nine against one, and we can make you disappear forever.
- What?
- I said, "We have free wi-fi".
Look, Pawnee is a town on the rise, and national parks could get in on the ground floor.
It's the best option, hands down.
Well, I'll run this up the flagpole.
Also, can you bring back Power Rangers?
I don't know what it is you do, but you seem important enough to get that done.
Sometimes you have to make the hardest climb to see the most beautiful sunrise.
I read that once on an old lady's decorative pillow.
But it is really how I feel today.
I've climbed a very weird and rocky mountain, and it was a pain in the ass, and my legs are tired, and I'm starving, but the sun is rising over a sea of love and waffles and possibility.
So I'm just gonna relax and take a deep breath and enjoy this view for as long as I possibly can.
Call Ken and Rebecca, and no statements to the press unless I personally release them.
We are on a media lockdown.
Where is Ed with the file?
Ed!
I'm sorry, Miss Knope, I lost the file.
- It's gone.
- Ed, you're a nice guy, but you're the most incompetent person I've ever word with, and that includes Terry.
Jeez!
Get it together, Terry.
Clean out your desk.
You're fired.
I understand.
Thank you for the literally hundreds of opportunities you've given me.
Good-bye, everyone.
It's been a great three years.
Cancel my flight to South Dakota.
We'll do it next month.
- Babe, what's our play here?
- Everyone's waiting downstairs in my office.
Let's just go hear what they have to say.
But honey, tonight's your big night.
No, this is more important.
Where are the kids?
- Right here.
- Hey, guys!
Mommy and daddy had to do a little work, and you're gonna have a fun play date with Uncle Andy - and Aunty April, okay?
- Let's go, munchkins.
I forgot, Ben how many bags of marshmallows do I give them?
None!
Just let April do everything.
One day, in the distant future, things will be calm and normal, right?
Probably not.
But that's okay.
- You ready?
- Not at all.
But that's never stopped us before.
