{START OF EPISODE 1}
If a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either is observed.
..
.
..
it will not go through both.
If unobserved, it will.
If it's observed after it left the plane, before it hits its target.
.
.
-.
.
.
it will not have gone through both slits.
-Agreed.
What's your point?
There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt.
-Excuse me.
-Hang on.
One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabokov.
Twenty-six across is MCM.
Fourteen down is-- Move your finger.
--phylum, which makes 1 4 across Port-Au-Prince.
See, Papa Doc's capital idea, that's Port-Au-Prince.
Haiti.
-Can I help you?
-Yes.
Um, is this the high-IQ sperm bank?
If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
I think this is the place.
-Fill these out.
-Thank you.
-We'll be right back.
-Oh, take your time.
I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.
Oh, wait.
Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
What, are you kidding?
You're a semipro.
No.
We are committing genetic fraud.
There's no guarantee our sperm's going to generate high-IQ offspring.
Think about that.
I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
Sheldon, this was your idea.
A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment?
I know.
And I do yearn for faster downloads.
There's some poor woman who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.
What if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use.
.
.
.
..
a differential to solve for the area under a curve?
-I'm sure she'll still love him.
-I wouldn't.
Well, what do you wanna do?
-I want to leave.
-Okay.
-What's the protocol for leaving?
-I don't know.
I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.
Let's try just walking out.
Okay.
-Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
-No.
You wanna hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Not really.
If the height of a step is off by as little as two millimeters -.
.
.
most people will trip.
-I don't care.
Two millime--?
That doesn't seem right.
It's true.
I did a series of experiments when I was 1 2.
My father broke his clavicle.
Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
No.
That was the result of my work with lasers.
I go ahead and smile New neighbor?
Evidently.
Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
Two-hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition?
Yes, she is.
Oh, hi.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Hi?
We don't mean to interrupt.
We live across the hall.
Oh, that's nice.
No.
We don't live together.
I mean .
..
we live together, but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.
Okay, well, guess Iâm your new neighbor.
-Penny.
-Leonard.
Sheldon.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Hi.
Well.
.
.
.
Oh, welcome to the building.
Oh, thank you.
Maybe we can have coffee sometime.
-Oh, great.
-Great.
-Great.
-Great.
Well, bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Should we have invited her for lunch?
No.
We're gonna start season two of Battlestar Galactica.
We already watched the season two DVDs.
Not with commentary.
I think we should be good neighbors.
Invite her over, make her feel welcome.
We never invited Louie/Louise over.
Well, and that was wrong of us.
We need to widen our circle.
I have a very wide circle.
I have 21 2 friends on MySpace.
Yes, and you've never met one of them.
That's the beauty of it.
I'm gonna invite her over.
We'll have a nice meal and chat.
Chat?
We don't chat, at least not off-line.
Well, it's not difficult.
You just listen to what she says.
..
.
..
and then you say something appropriate in response.
To what end?
-Hi.
Again.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Anyway.
.
.
.
..
we brought home Indian food.
..
.
..
and I know that moving can be stressful.
.
.
.
..
and I find that when I'm undergoing stress..
.
.
..
that good food and company can have a comforting effect.
Also, curry's a natural laxative and I don't have to tell you that, you know.
.
.
.
..
a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.
I'm no expert, but in the context of a lunch invitation.
.
.
.
..
you might wanna skip the reference to bowel movements.
Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?
Yes.
Oh, that's so nice.
I'd love to.
Great.
So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
-Okay, well, make yourself at home.
-Okay.
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome.
You're very welcome.
This looks like some serious stuff.
Leonard, did you do this?
Actually, that's my work.
Wow.
Yeah, well, it's just some quantum mechanics .
..
with a little string theory doodling around the edges.
That part's just a joke.
It's a spoof of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
So you're, like, one of those Beautiful Mind genius guys.
Yeah.
This is really impressive.
I have a board, if you like boards.
This is my board.
Holy smokes.
If by "holy smokes," you mean a derivative restatement of the stuff.
.
.
.
..
you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT, sure.
-What?
-Oh, come on.
Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit brokenhearted"?
At least I didn't have to invent 26 dimensions just to make the math come out.
-I didn't invent them.
They're there.
-In what universe?
In all of them, that is the point.
Do you guys mind if I start?
-Penny.
-Yeah?
That's where I sit.
So sit next to me.
-No, I sit there.
-What's the difference?
-What's the difference?
-Here we go.
In winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm.
..
.
..
yet not so close as to cause perspiration.
In the summer, it's in a cross breeze created by opening windows there and there.
It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, discouraging conversation.
.
.
.
..
nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion.
I could go on, but I think I've made my point.
Do you want me to move?
-Well .
-Just sit somewhere else.
Fine.
Sheldon, sit.
Ah.
Well, this is nice.
We don't have a lot of company over.
That's not true.
Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over.
Yes, I know.
Tuesday night we played Klingon Boggle until 1 in the morning.
-Yeah, I remember.
-I resent you saying we don't have company.
-That has a negative social implication.
-I said Iâm sorry.
So .
..
Klingon Boggle?
Yeah.
It's like regular Boggle, but in Klingon.
That's probably enough about us.
So tell us about you.
Me?
Okay.
I'm a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.
Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion.
.
.
.
..
that the sun's position relative to arbitrary constellations .
..
at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.
Participate in the what?
I think what Sheldon's trying to say .
..
is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.
Oh, yeah, a lot of people think Iâm a water sign.
Okay, let's see, what else?
Oh, Iâm a vegetarian.
No, except for fish, and the occasional steak.
I love steak.
Well, that's interesting.
Leonard can't process corn.
So do you have some sort of a job?
Oh, yeah.
I'm a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.
I love cheesecake.
-You're lactose intolerant.
-I don't eat it, I think it's a good idea.
Anyways, Iâm also writing a screenplay.
It's about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln, Nebraska .
..
to be an actress and winds up a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.
So it's based on your life.
No, I'm from Omaha.
If that was a movie, I would go see it.
I know, right?
Okay, let's see, what else?
I guess that's about it.
That's the story of Penny.
Well, it sounds wonderful.
It was.
Until I fell in love with a jerk.
What is happening?
I don't know.
Oh, God, you know, four years I lived with him.
Four years.
That's like as long as high school.
It took you four years to get through high school?
I just-- I can't believe I trusted him.
Should I say something?
I feel I should say something.
You?
No, you'll only make it worse.
You wanna know the most pathetic part?
Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts .
..
I still love him.
Is that crazy?
Yes.
No, it's not crazy.
It's a-- It's a paradox.
Paradoxes are part of nature.
I mean, think about light.
If you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double-slit experiments.
But then, along comes Albert Einstein .
..
and discovers that light behaves like particles too.
Well, I didn't make it worse.
Oh, Iâm so sorry I'm such a mess.
And on top of everything else, I'm all gross from moving.
.
.
.
..
and my stupid shower doesn't work.
Our shower works.
Really?
Would it be totally weird if I used it?
-Yes.
-No.
-No?
-No.
No.
It's right down the hall.
Okay, thanks.
You guys are really sweet.
Well, this is an interesting development.
How so?
It has been some time.
..
.
..
since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
That's not true.
Remember at Thanksgiving .
..
my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode?
Point taken.
It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off..
.
.
..
after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?
Excuse me?
That woman in there is not going to have sex with you.
Well, I'm not trying to have sex with her.
Oh, good.
Then you won't be disappointed.
What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me?
I'm a male and she's a female.
Yes, but not of the same species.
I'm not gonna engage in hypotheticals here.
-I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
-Oh, of course.
That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop .
..
that I wouldn't participate.
However briefly.
Do you think this possibility will be hindered.
.
.
.
..
when she discovers your Luke Skywalker "no more tears" shampoo?
It's Darth Vader shampoo.
Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.
-Wait till you see this.
-It's fantastic.
Unbelievable.
See what?
It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1 974.
This isn't a good time.
It's before he became .
..
a creepy computer voice.
-That's great, you guys have to go.
-Why?
-It's just not a good time.
-Leonard has a lady over.
Yeah, right.
Your grandmother back in town?
No.
And she's not a lady, she's just a new neighbor.
Hang on, there really is a lady here?
-Uh-huh.
-And you want us out.
.
.
.
..
because you're anticipating coitus?
-I'm not anticipating coitus.
-So she's available for coitus?
Can we please just stop saying "coitus"?
Technically, that would be coitus interruptus.
Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower?
Oh, hi, sorry.
Hello.
EnchantÃ©, mademoiselle.
Howard Wolowitz, CalTech Department of Applied Physics.
You may be familiar with some of my work.
It's currently orbiting Jupiter's largest moon .
..
taking high-resolution digital photographs.
Penny.
I work at The Cheesecake Factory.
-I'll show you the trick with the shower.
-Okay.
I'm sorry?
It's French for "good shower".
It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.
Save it for your blog, Howard.
All right, there it goes.
It sticks, Iâm sorry.
-Okay, thanks.
-You're welcome.
Oh, you're just gonna step right--?
Okay.
Hey, Leonard?
- The hair products are Sheldon's.
Okay.
-Um, can I ask you a favor?
-A favor?
Sure, you could ask me a favor.
I would do you a favor for you.
-It's okay if you say no.
-Oh, I'll probably say yes.
It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met.
Wow.
I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
-Must we?
-Event  A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower.
We drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set.
.
.
.
..
from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend.
On what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link .
..
between these events?
She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.
Well, that may be the proximal cause of our journey.
..
.
..
but we both know it exists in contradistinction.
.
.
.
..
to the higher-level distal cause.
-Which is?
-You think with your penis.
That's a biological impossibility, and you didn't have to come.
Oh, yes.
I could have stayed behind to watch Wolowitz hit on Penny .
..
in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.
And why can't she get her own TV?
Come on, you know how it is with breakups.
No, I don't, and neither do you.
But l-- I broke up with Joyce Kim.
You did not break up with Joyce Kim.
She defected to North Korea.
To mend her broken heart.
This situation is much less complicated.
There's some dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend.
.
.
.
..
as to who gets custody of the TV.
-She just wanted to avoid a scene with him.
-So we get to have a scene with him?
No, Sheldon, there's not going to be a scene.
There's two of us and one of him.
Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.
So you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the university?
I'm sorry, do you speak English?
Oh, he speaks English.
He just can't speak to women.
Really?
Why?
He's kind of a nerd.
Juice box?
- I'll do the talking.
- Yeah?
-Hi.
I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
-Hello.
What did I just--?
-We're here to pick up Penny's TV.
-Get lost.
Okay, thanks for your time.
-We're not gonna give up just like that.
-Leonard, the TV's in the building.
We've been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.
Excuse me.
If I were to give up at the first hitch, I never would have identified.
.
.
.
..
the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.
My apologies.
What's your plan?
It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360.
We should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.
-What do you think their combined IQ is?
-Just grab the door.
This is it.
I'll do the talking.
Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.
-Yeah?
-I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
From the intercom.
How the hell did you get in the building?
We're scientists.
Tell him about our IQ.
-Leonard.
-What?
-My mom bought me those pants.
-I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to call her.
Sheldon, I am so sorry I dragged you through this.
It's okay.
It wasn't my first pantsing and it won't be my last.
And you were right about my motives.
I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny.
.
.
.
..
that might have someday led to sex.
Well, you got me out of my pants.
Anyway, I've learned my lesson.
She's out of my league, I'm done with her.
I've got my work.
One day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.
Don't think like that.
You're not going to die alone.
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.
And you're certainly not gonna win a Nobel Prize.
This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest.
They have a great house ale.
Wow, cool tiger.
Yeah, I've had him since Level 1 0.
His name is Buttons.
Anyway, if you had your own game character.
.
.
.
..
we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.
-That sounds interesting.
-So you'll think about it?
Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.
Smooth.
-We're home.
-Oh, my God.
What happened?
Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.
I'm so sorry.
I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.
No, it was a valid hypothesis.
That was a valid hypo--?
What is happening to you?
Really, thank you so much for going and trying.
You just-- You're so terrific.
Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?
-Really?
Great.
-Thank you.
Okay.
You're not done with her, are you?
Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
Not to mention imaginary.
-Is Thai food okay with you, Penny?
-Sure.
We can't have Thai, we had Indian for lunch.
-So?
-They're both curry-based cuisines.
-So?
-It would be gastronomically redundant.
I can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
Any ideas, Raj?
Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado.
I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me Oh,, baby, baby Don't get hooked on me I don't know your odds in the world as a whole.
.
.
.
..
but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a veritable mac daddy.
Baby, don't get hooked on me
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Here you go.
Pad Thai, no peanuts.
Does it have peanut oil?
I'm not sure.
Everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.
Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.
- Any chopsticks?
- Don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.
Here we go.
Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th century.
They don't put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.
Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.
I'll get it.
Do I look puffy?
I feel puffy.
- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi, Penny.
- Am I interrupting?
- No.
You're not swelling, Howard.
No, look at my fingers, they're like Vienna sausages.
- Sounds like you have company.
- They're not going anywhere.
So you're coming home from work.
That's great.
How was work?
You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory people order cheesecake and I bring it to them.
So you kind of act as like a carbohydrate delivery system?
Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage.
Yeah.
I was wondering if you could help me out - Yes.
- Oh.
Okay, great, I'm having some furniture delivered and I may not be here, so, oh Hello.
I'm sorry?
Haven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?
- No, I haven't.
- Get used to it.
Yeah, I probably won't.
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hi.
Hey, Raj.
Still not talking to me, huh?
Don't take it personally, it's his pathology.
- He can't talk to women.
- He can't talk to attractive women.
Or in your case, a cheesecake-scented goddess.
There's gonna be some furniture delivered?
Yeah.
If it gets here and I'm not here, could you sign for it and put it in?
- Yeah, no problem.
- Great, here's my spare key.
Thank you.
- Penny, wait.
- Yeah?
Um If you don't have any other plans do you wanna join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
A marathon?
Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
You're kidding, right?
I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman catches her.
- Which one was that?
- One.
You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy?
Yes, I know, men can't fly.
No, let's assume that they can.
Lois Lane is falling.
Accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second.
Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel.
Miss Lane, who is now traveling at approximately and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.
Unless Superman matches her speed and decelerates.
In what space, sir?
In what space?
She's 2 feet above the ground.
If he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement.
- It would be a more merciful death.
- That doesn't Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.
Are you listening to yourself?
Superman's flight is a feat of strength.
An extension of his ability to leap buildings an ability he derives from exposure to sun How does he fly at night?
A combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.
I'm just gonna go wash up.
I have 2600 comic books in there.
I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.
Challenge accepted.
We're locked out.
Also, the pretty girl left.
Okay.
Her apartment's on the fourth floor, elevator is broken, you're gonna Oh, you're just gonna be done?
Okay, cool, thanks.
- I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.
- I hardly think so.
Why not?
Well, we don't have a dolly or lifting belts, or any measurable upper-body strength.
We don't need strength.
We're physicists.
We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes.
Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth.
It's just a matter I don't have this!
I do not have this!
Archimedes would be so proud.
Do you have any ideas?
Yes, but they all involve a Green Lantern and a power ring.
Easy.
Easy.
Okay.
Now we've got an inclined plane.
Force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs call it 30 degrees, so about half.
Exactly half.
Exactly half.
Let's push.
Okay.
See, it's moving.
This is easy.
It's all in the math.
- What's your formula for the corner?
- What?
Oh, okay.
Okay, yeah, no problem.
Just come up here, help me pull and turn.
Oh, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.
You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
Men do things for women without expecting sex.
Yeah, those would be men who just had sex.
I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.
In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds.
Almost there.
Almost there.
- Almost there.
No, we're not.
- No, we're not.
No, we're not.
- I'm sorry.
- Watch your fingers.
- Yeah.
Oh, God, my fingers!
- You okay?
- No, it hurt Great Caesar's ghost, look at this place.
So Penny is a little messy.
A little messy?
The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy.
This is chaos.
Excuse me.
Explain to me a system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid?
I'm just inferring that this as a couch because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.
Did it occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort organize and label the entire world around them?
No.
Well, they don't.
Hard as it may be to believe most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content.
Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
- Come on, we should go.
- Hang on.
- What are you doing?
- I'm straightening up.
Sheldon, this is not your home.
This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.
When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.
Because it was immaculate.
I mean, you open that man's closet it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses and his police uniforms.
What were you doing in his closet?
I helped him run some cable for a webcam.
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Penny.
This just arrived.
Brought this up.
Just now.
Great.
Was it hard getting up the stairs?
- No.
- No?
- No.
- No.
- We'll get out of your hair.
- Okay, great.
Thank you again.
Penny?
I just want you to know that you don't have to live like this.
I'm here for you.
What's he talking about?
- It's a joke.
- I don't get it.
Yeah, he didn't tell it right.
Sheldon?
Sheldon?
Hello?
-  Sheldon?
- Shh!
Penny's sleeping.
Are you insane?
You can't break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean.
I had no choice.
I couldn't sleep knowing that outside my bedroom was our living room and outside our living room was that hallway and immediately adjacent to that hallway was this.
Do you realize that if Penny wakes up there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here?
I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
No, no.
You gave me an explanation.
It's reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.
Don't be ridiculous.
I have no peers.
Sheldon, we have to get out of here.
You might want to speak in a lower register.
What?
Evolution has made women sensitive to high-pitch noises while they sleep so that they'll be roused by a crying baby.
If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.
That's ridiculous!
No, that's ridiculous.
Fine.
I accept your premise.
Now, please let's go.
- I'm not leaving until I'm done.
- Oh, no.
If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.
Oh, what the hell.
Good morning.
Morning.
I have to say I slept splendidly.
Granted not long, but just deeply and well.
I'm not surprised.
A well-known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbor's apartment and clean.
Sarcasm?
You think?
Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox but the end result will be a measurable enhancement to Penny's quality of life.
You've convinced me, maybe we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.
- You don't think that crosses a line?
- Yes.
For God's sake, Sheldon do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth?
You have a sarcasm sign?
No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.
You want some cereal?
I feel so good today, I'm gonna choose from the low-fiber end of the shelf.
Hello, Honey Puffs.
Son of a bitch!
Penny's up.
You sick, geeky bastards!
How did she know it was us?
I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her bedroom closet.
Leonard?
This is gonna be bad.
Goodbye, Honey Puffs.
Hello, Big Bran.
You came into my apartment while I was sleeping?
Yes, but only to clean.
Really more to organize, you're not actually dirty, per Se.
Give me back my key.
I'm very, very sorry.
Do you understand how creepy this is?
Yes, we discussed it at length last night.
In my apartment?
While I was sleeping?
And snoring.
And that's probably just a sinus infection.
But it could be sleep apnea.
You might wanna see an otorhinolaryngologist.
The throat doctor.
And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
Depending on the depth that's either a proctologist, or a general surgeon.
Oh.
- God!
- Okay, look.
No, Penny I think what you're feeling is valid and maybe later today when you're feeling less, for lack of a better word, violated maybe we can talk about this.
- Stay away from me.
- Sure.
That's another way to go.
Penny, Penny, hold on.
Just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave.
Is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping?
Or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm?
Well, that was a little non-responsive.
You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize.
What's funny?
That wasn't sarcasm?
- No!
- Whoo.
Boy, you are all over the place this morning.
I have a Master's and two Ph.
Ds, I should not have to do this.
What?
I'm truly sorry for what happened last night.
I take full responsibility.
I hope that it won't color your opinion of Leonard who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.
I did what I could.
Hey, Raj.
Hey, I don't know if you heard about what happened with Leonard and Sheldon but I'm really upset about it.
I mean, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it.
Can you even believe that?
How weird is that?
RAJESH : She's standing very close to me.
Oh, my.
She does smell good.
What is that?
Vanilla?
You know?
Where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot.
Okay?
And you don't shoot to wound.
I mean, all right my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk.
What was I saying?
She's so chatty.
Maybe my parents were right.
Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl.
We'd have the same cultural background and my wife could sing to my children the lullabies my mother sang to me.
It's obvious they meant well.
I'm having a really rough time.
Like I said I broke up with my boyfriend and it's freaking me out.
I mean, just because most of the men I've known happened to be jerks doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are.
Right?
She asked me a question.
I should probably nod.
That's exactly what I thought.
Thank you for listening.
You're a doll.
Uh-oh.
Turn your pelvis.
Grab a napkin, homey, you just got served.
It's fine.
You win.
What's his problem?
His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Been there.
Hello.
Sorry I'm late, but I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.
Really?
You?
Rajesh Koothrappali spoke to Penny?
Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.
What did she say?
Is she still mad at me?
Well, she was upset at first but probably because her sister shot somebody.
Then there was something about you, and then she hugged me.
She hugged you?
How did she hug you?
Is that her perfume I smell?
Intoxicating, isn't it?
- Hi.
- Oh.
What's going on?
Uh Here's the thing: "Penny, just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb so too I regret my participation in what was at the very least, an error in judgment.
The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes.
Madam Curie's discovery of radium turned out to have great potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning.
Another example, from the field of Ebola research" Leonard.
Yeah?
We're okay.
Six two-inch dowels?
- Check.
- One package Philips head screws?
- Check.
Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay?
I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was, like, 12.
I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media center.
Please, we insist.
It's the least we can do, considering Considering what?
How great this place looks?
- Oh, boy, I was afraid of this.
- What?
These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components.
This right here is why Sweden has no space program.
- It looked pretty good in the store.
- It is an inefficient design.
For example, Penny has a flatscreen TV which means all this space behind it is wasted.
- We could put her stereo back there.
- And control it how?
Run an infrared repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy-peasy.
- Good point.
How will you cool it?
- Guys, I got this.
- Hang on, Penny.
- How about fans?
- Here and here.
- Also inefficient, and might be loud.
How about a liquid cooler?
A little aquarium pump here.
Run some quarter-inch PVC Guys, this is actually really simple.
Hold on, honey, men at work.
PVC comes here.
Maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as radiator here.
Show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and a overflow reservoir?
If water's involved, we'll ground the crap out of the thing.
Guys, it's hot in here.
I think I'll just take off all my clothes.
Oh, I've got it.
What if we replaced panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft-grade aluminum?
- Entire thing's one big heat sink.
- Perfect.
Leonard and Sheldon, go to the junkyard and get 6 square meters of aluminum.
Raj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch.
- Meet in an hour?
- Done.
Got it.
Okay, this place does look pretty good.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
all right,just a few more feet.
And here we are,gentlemen,the gates of elzebob.
Good lord.
Don't panic.
This is what the last 97 hours have been about.
Stay frosty.
There's a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the sword of asaroth.
Warriors,unsheathe your weapons.
Magic wielders,raise your wands.
Lock and load.
Raj,blow the gates.
Blowing the gates.
Control,shift b!
oh,my god,so many goblins!
Don't just stand there,slash and move,slash and move!
Stay in formation!
Leonard,you got one on your tail.
That's all right,my tail's prehensile- - I'll swat him off.
I got him,leonard.
Tonight I spice my mead with goblin blood.
Raj,no,it's a trap!
They're flanking us!
He's got me!
Sheldon,he's got raj.
Use your sleep spell!
Sheldon sheldon?
I've got the sword of asaroth!
Forget the sword,sheldon,help raj!
There is no more sheldon.
I am the sword master!
Leonard,look out!
Damn it,man,we're dying here!
Goodbye, peasants!
the bastard teleported!
He's selling the sword of asaroth on ebay.
You betrayed us for money?
Who are you?
I'm a rogue night elf.
Don't you people read character descriptions?
Wait,wait,wait!
Somebody just clicked "buy it now.
" I am the sword master!
Our whole universe was in a hot,dense state then nearly 14 billion years go expansion started wait!
The earth began to cool the autotrophs began to drool, neanderthals developed tools we built the wall we built the pyramids math, science,history, unraveling the mystery that all started with a big bang bang!
Season 01 Episode 03 proudly presents Ooh,I'm all sweaty.
Anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming?
I just built a virtual pool.
No.
I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
sounds like your neighbor's home.
Excuse me.
Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.
Oh,right,right,right,right.
Stealing snail mail- - Penny,the mailman,did it again he oh,sorry.
Um,oh,hi,leonard.
This is doug.
Doug,this is my neighbor leonard.
What's up,bro?
Not much bro.
Is everything okay?
Yeah,no,I just I got your mail again.
Here.
Thank you.
I've got to talk to that mailman.
Oh,no,that's probably not such a good idea.
You know,civil servants have a documented propensity to,you know,snap,so okay.
Well,thank you again.
No problem.
Bye.
Oh,and bye bro.
Penny for your thoughts.
What's the matter?
I'm fine.
Penny's fine.
The guy she's kissing is really fine.
Kissing,what kind of kissing?
Cheeks?
What is wrong with you?
I'm a romantic.
Please don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.
I'm not jealous.
I'm just a little concerned for her.
I didn't like the look of the guy that she was with.
Because he looks better than you?
Yeah.
He was kind of dreamy.
Well,at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted, olsmdering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyze the data so that you don't crash into geek mountain.
I disagree, love is not a sprint,it's a marathon- - a relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms or hits you with the pepper spray.
No,I'm done with penny.
I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.
Like who?
I don't know olivia geiger.
The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
Yeah.
Oh,I don't think you have a shot there.
I have noticed that leslie winkle recently started shaving her legs.
Now given that winter is coming, one can only assume she's signaling sexual availability.
I don't know.
You guys work in the same lab.
So?
There are pitfalls.
Trust me,I know.
When it comes to sexual harassment law,I'm a bit of a self taught expert.
Look,howard,if I were to ask leslie winkle out,it would just be for dinner.
I'm not going to walk into the lab,ask her to strip naked and dance for me.
Oh,then you're probably okay.
Hello,leslie.
Hi,leonard.
Leslie,I would like to propose an experiment - goggles,leonard.
- Right.
Leslie,I would like p toropose an experiment.
Hang on.
I'm trying to see how long it takes a 500 - kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup a' noodles.
I've done it.
About two seconds.
2.
6 for minestrone.
anyway,I was thinking more of a bio- social exploration with a neuro- chemical overlay.
Wait,are you asking me out?
I was going to characterize it as the modification of our colleague- slash- friendship paradigm with the addition of a date like component, but we don't need to quibble over terminology.
What sort of experiment would you propose?
There's a generally accepted pattern in this area.
I would pick you up,take you to a restaurant.
Then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of hugh grant or sandra bullock.
Interesting.
And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the biochemical reaction during the good night kiss?
Heart rate,pheromones,etc.
Yes.
Why don't we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable?
You mean kiss you now?
Yes.
Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
Close - mouthed but romantic.
Mint?
Thank you.
shall I count down from three?
No,I think it needs to be spontaneous.
What do you think?
You proposed the experiment.
I think you should present your findings first.
Fair enough.
On the plus side,it was a good kiss.
Reasonable technique,no extraneous spittle.
On the other hand,no arousal.
- None?
- None.
Well,thank you for your time.
Thanyok U. None at all?
Sheldon,if you were a robot,and I knew and you didn'T would you want me to tell you?
That depends.
When I learn that I'm a robot will I be able to handle it?
Maybe- - although the history of science fiction is not on your side.
Okay,uh,let me ask you this- - when I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by asimov's three laws of robotics?
You might be bound by them right now.
That's true.
Have you ever harmed a human being or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?
Of course not.
Have you ever harmed yourself or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?
Well,no.
I smell robot.
Hey,what's going on?
Internet's been down for half an hour.
Also,sheldon may be a robot.
So how'd it go with leslie?
Oh,we tried kissing,but the earth didn't move.
I mean,any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.
Oh,I've seen that look before.
This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats.
I don't know if I can take it.
You could power down.
Well,as usual,wolowitz has the solution.
I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women and leonard could have his pick.
remember the latin hips.
Shoulders stay still,and we sway.
One,two,three five,six,seven.
I think mrs.
Tishman's got her eye on you.
I've been there.
You're in for a treat.
She said,"you don't know me" doyou "n't even care" oh,yeah oh,good lord.
She said,"you don't know me" "you don't wear my chains" oh,yeah.
God,that's a good song.
If you're compiling a mix cd for a double suicide.
Oh,I hope that scratching post is for you.
I know what you're thinking.
I've taken your asthma into account.
There's a feline geneticist in san diego who's developed the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos.
Leonard,listen to me I've been thinking about names.
I'm kind of torn between einstein,newton and sergeant fuzzy boots.
Leonard,do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationshh witip a genetically altered cat?
Maybe.
If it's a cute,little,cuddly cat.
Oh,come on.
Leonard this is obviously about penny.
It doesn't matter.
The woman's not interested in me.
The woman rejected me.
Okay,look,I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with penny as the hubble telescope does of discovering at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker.
Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did not reject you.
You did not ask her out.
You're right.
I didn't ask her out.
I should ask her out.
No,no,now that was not my point.
My point was don't buy a cat.
No,but you're right.
I should march over there and ask her out.
Oh,goody,we're getting a cat.
Uh no.
Oh,hey,leonard.
Good afternoon,penny.
So,hi hey.
Uh I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.
Uh,you mean dinner tonight?
There is an inherent ambiguity in the word "dinner.
" Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it's consumed.
So to clarify here,by dinner I mean supper.
- Supper?
- Or dinner.
I was thinking 6:30 if you can go.
Or a different time.
Uh,6:30's great.
Really?
Great.
Yeah,I like hanging out with you guys.
Us guys?
Yeah,you know,sheldon,howard,raj.
Who all's coming?
They might all be there.
Or a subset of them might be there.
Algebraically speaking,there are too many unknowns.
For example,sheldon had quiznos for lunch.
Sometimes he finds that filling,other times he doesn'T.
It's no fault of quiznos- - they have a varied menu.
Okay,whatever.
It sounds like fun.
Great.
Did we say a time?
- And that's still good for you?
- It's fine.
- 'Cause it's not carved in stone.
- No,6:30's great.
I'll get my chisel.
Why?
To carve the I'll see you at 6:30.
How do I look?
Could you be more specific?
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
No.
The dark crescent shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.
What time is your date?
Perfect.
That gives you two hours and 15 minutes for that dense molecular cloud of aramis to dissipate.
Is it too much?
Not if you're a rugby team.
By the way,if it should ever come up,you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at quiznos.
Why would I join you?
No reason.
Oh,you know what,maybe this isn't such a good idea.
Oh,no,well,now there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgment on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.
You're right.
Alcohol,poor judgment- - it could go well.
Of course there is the other possibility, that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall, until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.
You could've stopped at "it could go well.
" If I could've,I would've.
I mean,I'm a perfectly nice guy.
There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant,and have a lovely dinner, maybe take a walk afterwards,talk about things we have in common.
You love pottery?
I love pottery!
There's a pause,we both know what's happening.
I lean in,we kiss.
It's a little tentative at first,but then I realize she's kissing me back.
She's biting my lower lip!
She wants me!
This thing is going the distance!
We're going to have sex!
Oh,god,oh,my god!
Is the sex starting now?
I'm having a panic attack.
Oh,okay.
Uh,well then calm down.
If I could calm down,I wobe having a panic att that's why they call it a panic attack.
All right,all right.
Uh,s- s- sit down.
Yeah,sit down.
Now close your eyes.
- Why?
- Just do it.
Okay.
Now try to increase your alpha wave activity.
What?
!
It's a biofeedback technique.
It's relaxation through brain wave manipulation.
I read a paper about it in journal of american neuroscience.
It was a little sparsely sourced,but I think the basic science is valid.
I probably have it here somewher E. Who am I kidding?
I can't go through with this.
You need to call her and cancel.
- Me?
- Yes.
- What should I tell her?
- I don't know.
- Tell her I'm sick.
- Okay.
Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.
Got it.
So I'm assuming nothing venereal?
I'll just tell her that you had a routine conoloscopy and haven't quite bounced back.
Give me the phone.
I thought you wanted to cancel.
I can't,because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.
Why would she be expecting me?
Stop asking me all these questions.
I need to take another shower.
So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
Oh,yeah no.
It turns out that raj and howard had to work,and sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.
Oh,my uncle just had a colonoscopy.
You're kidding.
Then that's something we have in common.
How?
We both have people in our lives who want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.
so what's new in the world of physics?
Nothing.
Really?
Nothing?
Well,with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930s.
And you can't prove string theory.
At best you can say,"hey,look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.
" Ah.
Well,I'm sure things will pick up.
What's new at the cheesecake factory?
Oh,uh,not much.
We do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well.
Good.
Good.
What about your,uh hallway friend?
Doug?
Oh,yeah,I don't know.
I mean,you know,he's nice and funny,but can I get you started with some drinks?
No!
- You were saying?
But - I'd like a drink.
Just say the "but" thing about doug and then I'll get her back.
Okay,well,I don't know,it's just me.
I'm still getting over this breakup with kurt and this thing with doug would stju be rebound sex.
Oh,don't get me started on rebound sex.
It's just it's my pattern.
I break up,then I find some cute guy, and then it's just 36 meaningless hours of you know.
I'm not sure that I do.
is that one 36-hour experience, or is that 36 hours spread out over,say one glorious summer?
No,it's usually over a weekend, and trust me,you do not feel good after it.
Well,chafing,right?
Emotionally.
Of course,yeah,emotional chafing.
Hey,do you want to see something cool?
I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it.
- How?
- Physics.
Wow,centrifugal force.
Actually,it's centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive Excuse me.
If you were riding on the olive, you'd be in a non - inertial reference frame and would are you okay?
Yeah,I'm okay.
Did you spill ketchup?
- No.
- I'm not okay.
Are you sure you don't want to go to the emergency room?
No,no,I'm okay.
It stopped bleeding.
I know,but you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?
Yes.
But I get car sick,too,so okay.
Sorry about your car,by the way.
Oh,no,it's fine.
You got most of it out the window.
The poor guy on the bike.
Well,I had a nice time.
Yeah,me,too.
Well,um,good night.
Good night.
- Leonard?
- Ahye?
Was this supposed to be a date?
This?
No.
No,of course not.
This was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up 'cause of work and a colonoscopy.
Okay,I was just checking.
When I take a girl on a date- - and I do- - she knows she's been dated.
Capital D. boldface.
Undeinrled.
Da ted.
I think I might have a little concussion.
I'm gonna go lie down.
Good night.
So,how was your date?
Awesome!
Score one for liquor and poor judgment.

{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
you know,I've been thinking about time travel again.
Why,did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Put it on the back burner.
Anyway,it occurs to me if I ever did perfect a time machine, I would just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.
Interesting.
Yeah,it really takes the pressure off.
Sounds like a breakthrough.
Should I call science magazine and tell them to hold the cover?
It's time travel,leonard,I will have already done that.
Then I guess congratulations are in order.
No,congratulations will have been in order.
You know,I am not going to enjoy this party.
I know,I'm familiar with you.
The last department party,professor finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
Yes,I was there.
You know what's interesting about caves,leonard?
- What?
- Nothing.
Well,then we'll avoid finkleday,we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him,shake his hand and go.
How's this?
"Pleased to meet you,dr.
Gablehauser.
"How fortunate for you that the university's "chosen to hire you, despite the fact "that you've done no original research in 25 years, "and instead have written a series of popular books " that reduce the great concepts of science "to a series of anecdotes, "each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration "of an average bowel movement.
Mahalo.
" "Mahalo's" a nice touch.
You know there only eight consonants in the hawaiian language?
Interesting.
You should lead with that.
Oh,god,look at this buffet.
I love america.
You don't have buffets in india?
Of course,but it's all indian food.
You can't find a bagel in mumbai to save your life.
Shmear me.
Well,here's an interesting turn of events.
What?
Howard brought a date?
A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
Hey,what up,science bitches?
May I introduce my special lady friend summer?
Howard,I told you touching's extra.
Right.
Sorry.
Here comes our new boss.
Be polite.
Hi,fellas.
- Eric gablehauser.
- Howard wolowitz.
Howard,nice to meet you.
And you are?
An actual real scientist.
How was that?
I can't believe he fired me.
Well,you did call him a glorified high school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.
In my defense,I prefaced that by saying,"with all due respect".
proudly presents sync:ÃÃÃÃ¢ÃÃ¢ Theory Season01 Episode04 Morning.
Morning.
You're making eggs for breakfast?
This isn't breakfast,it's an experiment.
'Cause it looks a lot like breakfast.
I finally have time to test my hypothesis about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins and its impact vis-a-vis taste.
Sounds yummy.
I look forward to your work with bacon.
As do I. You know,I'm sure if you just apologize to gablehauser,he would give you your job back.
I don't want my job back.
I've spent the past three and a half years staring at grease boards full of equations.
Before that,I spent four years working on my thesis.
Before that,I was in college,and before that,I was in the fifth grade.
This is my first d oayff in decades and I'm going to savor it.
Okay.
I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
Not just fixing my eggs,I'm fixing everyone's eggs.
And we all thank you.
use new eggs.
hi.
Hey,I'm running out to the market.
Do you guys need anything?
Oh,well,this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.
I'm sorry?
I need eggs.
Four dozen should suffice.
Four dozen?
Yes,and evenly distributed amongst brown,white, free-range,large,extra large and jumbo.
Okay,one more time.
Never mind.
You won't get it right.
I'd better come with you.
Oh,yay.
How come you didn't go into work today?
I'm taking a sabbatical because I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.
So you got canned,huh?
Theoretical physicists do not get canned but yeah.
Well,maybe it's all for the best.
You know,I always say when one door closes,another one opens.
No,it doesn'T.
Not unless the two doors are connected by relays or there are motion sensors involved.
No,no,I meant or if the first door closing creates a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Never mind.
Slow down.
Slow down.
Please,slow down!
We're fine!
You're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.
Oh,sure,I am.
No,no,let me do the math for you.
This car weighs,let's say 4,000 pounds.
Now add 140 for me,120 for you - 120?
- Oh,I'm sorry.
Did I insult you?
Is your body mass somehow tied into your self-worth?
Well,yeah.
Interesting.
Anyway,that gives us a total weight of,let's say 4,400 pounds.
Let's say 4,390.
Fine.
We're traveling forward at-- good lord-- 51 miles an hour.
Now let's assume that your brakes are new and the calipers are aligned.
Still,by the time we come to a stop, we'll be occupying the same space as that buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death,mutilation oh,look,they built a new putt-putt course.
This is great.
Look at me.
I'm in the real world of ordinary people just living their ordinary,colorless workaday lives.
Thank you.
No,thank you.
And thank you,ordinary person.
Hey,you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes?
Uh,no,no,not really.
Listen,didn't you say you needed some eggs?
Yes,but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.
Oh,okay,well,then maybe you should start heading on out then.
No,this is fun.
Oh,the thing about tomatoes-- and I think you'll really enjoy this-- is they're shelved with the vegetables,but they're technically a fruit.
- Oh,interesting.
- Isn't it?
No,I mean what you find enjoyable.
Oh,boy.
What now?
Well,there's some value to taking a multivitamin,but the human body can only absorb so much.
What you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.
Well,maybe that's what I was going for.
Well,then you'll want some manganese.
Well,that was fun.
Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.
Oh,I don't know,sheldon.
It's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.
Are you sure?
There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk.
For example,I noticed that you purchase your tampons one-month supply at a time.
What?
Think about it.
It's a product that doesn't spoil and you're going to be needing them for at least the next 30 years.
You want me to buy 30 years worth of tampons?
Well,30,35.
- When did your mother go into menopause?
- Okay.
I'm not talking about this with you.
Oh,penny,this is a natural human process,and we're talking about statistically significant savings.
Now,if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28-day cycle are you fairly regular?
Okay,no warehouse store,but we're still on for putt-putt golf,right?
Hey,I just ran into penny.
She seemed upset about something.
I think it's her time of the month.
I marked the calendar for future reference.
What's with the fish?
It's an experiment.
What happened to your scrambled egg research?
Oh,that was a dead end.
Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.
So fish?
I read an article about japanese scientists who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought,"hey,fish nightlights.
" Fish nightlights?
It's a billion-dollar idea.
Mum's the word.
Sheldon,are you sure you don't want to just apologize to gablehauser and get your job back?
Oh,no,no,no,I have too much to do.
Like luminous fish.
I'm sorry.
I didn'T that's just the beginning.
I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company.
Oh,glow-in-the-dark tampons!
Leonard,we're gonna be rich.
Thanks for coming on such short notice.
Well,you did the right thing calling.
I didn't know what else to do.
He's lost all focus.
Every day he's got a new obsession.
This is a particularly disturbing one.
Mommy?
Hi,baby!
Oh,you got yourself a loom?
How nice!
Thank you.
Honey,why'd you get a loom?
I was working with luminous fish,and I thought,hey "loom".
Mom,what are you doing here?
Leonard called me.
I know,but why?
Because one of the great minds of the 21st century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving serapes.
This is not a serape,this is a poncho.
A serape is open at the sides; a poncho is closed.
This is a poncho.
And neither is a reason to call someone's mother.
Really?
When was the last time you left the house?
I went to the market with penny.
Yeah,that was three weeks ago.
Well,then buckle up-- in the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby.
Sweetheart,your little friend is concerned about you.
Yes,well,I'm not a child-- I'm a grown man,capable of living my life as I see fit.
And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother!
Wait,where are you going?
To my room-- and no one's allowed in!
oh,he gets his temper from his daddy.
- He's got my eyes.
- I see.
All that science stuff,that comes from jesus.
Sheldon,your mom made dinner.
I'm not hungry!
Oh,leonard,don't trouble yourself.
He's stubborn.
He may stay in there till the rapture.
We so sure that's a bad thing?
I tell you,I love the boy to death,but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the k-mart.
Excuse me for being so bold,but I now see where sheldon gets his smoldering good looks.
Honey,that ain't gonna work,but you keep tryin'.
I made chicken.
I hope that isn't one of the animals that you people think is magic.
You know,we have an indian gentleman at our church, a dr.
Patel-- it's a beautiful story.
The lord spoke to him and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasik-- you know,those that needed it.
Leonard: That is a lovely story.
Um,are we gonna do anything about sheldon?
Oh,we will.
You have to take your time with sheldon.
His father,god rest his soul,used to always say to me, "mary,you have to take your time with sheldon".
Sounds like a wise man.
Oh,not so wise.
He once tried to fight a bobcat for some licorice.
So,everybody grab a plate and a pretty place mat that shelly wove.
Has shelly ever freaked out like this before?
Oh,all the time.
I remember one summer when he was 13, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was gonna provide free electricity for the whole town.
Well,the only problem was,he had no what you call "fissionable" materials.
Anyway,when he went on the internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle, and told him it's against the law to have yellow-cake uranium in a shed.
Well,what happened?
Well,poor boy had a fit.
Locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.
A death ray?
Well,that's what he called it.
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.
It pissed our dog off to no end.
You know,you two make a cute couple.
uh,no.
We're not we're not-not a couple.
We're singles.
- Two singles.
- Yeah.
Like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that we're friends.
Did I pluck a nerve there?
- Oh,yeah.
- Okay.
All right,everybody,it's time to eat.
Oh,lord,we thank you for this meal and all of your bounty.
And we pray that you help sheldon get back on his rocker.
Now,after a moment of silent meditation,I'm gonna end with "in jesus' name," but you two don't feel any obligation to join in.
Unless,of course,the holy spirit moves you.
Oh,my god,this is the best cobbler I've ever had.
It was always sheldon's favorite.
You know w thathe secret ingredient is?
- Love?
- Lard.
Hey,look who's come You'll spook him.
He's like a baby deer-- you got to let him come to you.
This is ridiculous.
Damn it,sheldon,snap out of it!
You're a physicist-- you belong at the university doing research,not hiding in your room!
you don't hunt,do you?
good morning,snickerdoodle.
Morning.
Oh,well,that looks awful fancy.
What is that?
It's my idea of what dna would look like in a silicon-based life-form.
But intelligently designed by a creator,right?
What do you want,mom?
You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?
Yeah.
Well,I'm done fishing.
You put those on.
What for?
Because you're gonna go down to your office, you're gonna apologize to your boss and get your job back.
No.
I'm sorry,did I start that sentence with the words,"if it please your highness"?
I'm not going to apologize-- I didn't say anything that wasn't true.
Now,you listen here.
I have been telling you since you were four years old, it's okay to be smarter than everybody,but you can't go around pointing it out.
Why not?
Because people don't like it!
Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbor kids?
now,let's get crackin'.
Shower,shirt,shoes,and let's shove off.
There wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
Problem solved.
Really?
That's impressive.
Leonard,the lord never gives us more than we can handle.
Thankfully,he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup.
Excuse me,dr.
Gablehauser,are you busy?
Well,actually sheldon,he's just doodlin'.
Get in here.
Dr.Gablehauser.
Dr.Cooper.
Let's go,baby-- we're losing daylight.
as you know,several weeks ago in our first encounter, we may have gotten off on the wrong foot when I called you an idiot.
And I just wanted to say that I was wrong to point it out.
I'm sorry,we haven't been introduced.
Dr.Eric gablehauser.
Mary cooper,sheldon's mom.
Now,that's impossible-- you must have had him when you were a teenager.
Oh,aren't you sweet.
His father's dead.
- Recently?
- Long enough.
Please.
sheldon,shouldn't you be working?
Okay.
Hey,how did it go?
I got my job back.
Really?
What happened?
I'm not quite sure.
It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.
Well,that narrows it down.
I'm very proud of you,honey.
You showed a lot of courage today.
Thanks,mom.
Mom?
Is dr.
Gablehauser going to be my new daddy?
We'll see.
Sleep tight.

{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
All right!
I'm moving my infantry division.
Augmented by bataillon of orcs from Lord of the Rings.
We flank the Tennessee volunteers and the North, once again, wins the battle of Gettysburg.
Not so fast!
Remember, the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.
No, orcs are magic.
Superman is vulnerable to magic.
Not to mention you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois cavalry and Hulk.
Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?
- You guys ready to order?
- Hang on, honey.
Shiva and Ganesh, the Hindu gods, against the entire Union army?
And orcs.
I'll be back.
Excuse me.
Ganesh is the Remover of Obstacles and Shiva is the Destroyer.
When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.
My boss says you have to either order or leave and never come back.
What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio funk?
A shower.
I'll take the Heart Smart platter.
All right, thank you, and Sheldon?
We don't eat here.
I don't know what's good.
- It's all good.
- Statistically unlikely.
Just get a hamburger.
You like hamburgers.
I like hamburgers where we usually have them.
You can't make the assumption that I'll like them here.
I'm sorry.
- Give him a hamburger.
- Which one?
The Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger, or the Kobe Burger?
Can't we just go to Big Boy?
They only have one burger the Big Boy.
The Barbecue Burger's like the Big Boy.
Excuse me, in a world that already includes a Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?
Because you're not at Big Boy!
- Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger.
- Make it two.
Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
Hey, Leonard.
Hi, guys.
Hi, Leslie.
I didn't know you ate here.
We don't.
This is a disturbing aberration.
Leslie, this is Penny.
She lives across the hall from Sheldon and me.
And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
Howard, I've asked you not to do that.
Leslie and I do research together at the university.
Wow, a girl scientist.
Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains.
Glad I ran into you.
The Physics Department string quartet needs a new cellist.
What happened to Elliot Wong?
He switched over to high-energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him.
- You're in?
- Yeah, sure, why not?
Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
Why at my place?
Department of Energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone.
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you, too.
I didn't know you played the cello.
Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in Advanced Placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.
If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.
Really?
I'm actually not that into music.
Your friend's really cute.
Anything going on with you two?
Leslie?
No, no.
- What, are you kidding?
- He asked her out once.
It was an embarrassing failure.
- Thank you, Sheldon.
- I'm sorry.
Was that supposed to be a secret?
That's too bad.
You guys'd make a cute couple.
Oh, dear.
- What's the matter?
- She didn't take my order.
How can she take your order when you're too neurotic to talk to her?
Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip.
What did Penny mean, "You'd make a cute couple"?
I assume she meant the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute.
An alternate and somewhat less likely interpretation is that you could manufacture one.
As in, "Look, Leonard and Leslie made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb.
Aren't they adorable"?
If Penny didn't know that Leslie had turned me down, then it would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her, Leslie, out, indicating that she had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out.
But, because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that she, Leslie, had turned me down, then she, Penny, could be offering consolation.
"That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple," but while thinking: "Good, Leonard remains available".
You're a lucky man, Leonard.
- How so?
- You're talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.
Well, what do you think?
I said I could follow it.
I didn't say I care.
I admire your fingering.
Thank you.
Maybe sometime you can try that on my instrument.
- G'night, guys.
Good job.
- Thanks.
See you next week.
- That was fun.
Thanks for including me.
- You're welcome.
If you're up for it, we could practice that middle section again.
Sure, why not?
Just so we're clear, you understand that me hanging back to practice with you is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available.
Really?
Yeah, I'm good to go.
I thought you weren't interested in me.
That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.
You mean my cello?
No, I mean the obvious, crude, double entendre.
I'm seducing you.
No kidding.
What can I say?
I'm a passionate and impulsive woman.
So how about it?
Is it the waitress?
What about her?
I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her.
Which, unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.
I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast.
Which could cause a positive urine test for opiates, but certainly not dilate my pupils.
So I guess there was no point in bringing it up.
You and the waitress then.
No no.
There's nothing going on between Penny and me.
So you're open to a sexual relationship?
Yeah, yeah, I guess I am.
- Good.
- Yeah, it is.
It is good.
Did you want to start now?
Why don't we finish the section first?
A little musical foreplay.
Terrific.
I'm good to go.
Me, too.
Hey, Sheldon.
What's going on?
I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
I'm sorry?
Semiotics.
The study of signs and symbols.
It's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.
Okay, sweetie, I know you think you're explaing yourself, but you're really not.
Just come with me.
- Well?
- Well, what?
What does it mean?
Oh, come on, you went to college.
Yes, but I was 11.
All right, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because, they're you know, gettin' busy.
So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there?
Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.
Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.
We really shouldn't be standing here.
This is very awkward.
Oh, come on, Leonard's had girls over before, right?
Yes, but there's usually planning, courtship, advance notice Last time, I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.
You had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?
I didn't have to.
The dates just happened to coincide.
So, do you know who's in there?
Well, there's Leonard.
And he's either with Leslie Winkle or a 1930s gangster.
Good for him.
Good for Leonard.
Okay, g'night.
No, no, wait, hold on.
What's the matter?
I don't know what the protocol is here.
Do I stay?
Do I leave?
Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?
You're asking the wrong girl.
I'm usually on the other side of the tie.
Hi, Leonard?
It's me, Sheldon In the living room.
I just I wanted you to know I saw the tie.
Message received.
You're welcome.
You carry on.
Give my best to Leslie.
Big Boy Someone touched my board.
Oh, God, my board!
Hey, what's the matter?
My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am.
Look at the beta function of quantum chromodynamics.
The sign's been changed.
Oh, yeah.
But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
Are you insane?
Are you out of your mind?
Are you-- Look!
That fixes the problem I've been having.
You're welcome.
You did this?
I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water.
So I fixed it.
Now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies.
Pretty cool, huh?
"Cool"?
Listen, I've got to get to the lab.
Thanks for a great night.
Thank you.
I'll see you at work.
Hold on.
Hold on!
- What?
- Who told you you could touch my board?
No one.
I don't come into your house and touch your board.
There are no incorrect equations on my board.
Oh, that is so so Sorry, I've got to run.
If you come up with an adjective, text me.
Inconsiderate.
That is the adjective, "inconsiderate.
" You can stare at your board all day.
She's still going to be right.
I'm not staring, I'm hauling.
So how's it going?
Pretty good.
Just pretty good?
I'd think you were doing very good.
Pretty, very there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of "good".
Why do you ask?
Well, a little bird told me that you and Leslie hooked up last night.
So, is it serious?
Do you like her?
I don't That's really two different questions.
I'm not Sheldon, we have to go!
You're wound awfully tight for a man who's just had sexual intercourse.
All right, I'll talk to you later, but I am so happy for you.
Thank you.
What did she mean she's happy for me?
Is she happy that I'm seeing someone?
Or is she happy because she thinks that I am?
Because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy.
Even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy.
Because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.
Do you realize I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
You know what?
I'm being ridiculous.
Who cares what Penny thinks?
Leslie is a terrific girl.
She's attractive.
We like each other.
She's extremely intelligent - She's not that intelligent.
- She fixed your equation.
- She got lucky.
- You don't believe in luck.
I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky.
Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Leslie.
I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future of happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy, with a woman who is currently making me happy.
I still don't care.
Careful, Leonard.
Liquid nitrogen, Why are you smashing a flash-frozen banana?
Because I got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn't find a knife.
So anyway Hello.
What are you doing?
Just extending the intimacy.
Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
What exactly do you think's going on between us?
I'm not sure, but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt.
Listen, neither of us are neuroscientists, but we both understand the biochemistry of sex.
I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses, causing pleasure.
You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button, he'll push that thing until he starves to death.
Well, who wouldn't?
Well, the only difference between us and the rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus.
That's where you come in.
Yeah, well, I'm just glad to be a part of it.
So what happens now?
I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Year's.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
You want to make plans for New Year's?
Please.
You're smothering me.
Look.
It's Dr. Stud!
Dr. What?
The blogosphere is a-buzzin' with news of you and Leslie Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang musik.
How did it get on the Internet?
I put it there.
How did you know about it?
A little bird told us.
Apparently, you are a magnificent beast.
That part's true.
I think I may have misjudged this restaurant.
- No kidding.
- I don't want to go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.
Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so brokenhearted.
Way ahead of you.
I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Souplantation.
Really?
The name always confused me anyway.
Souplantation.
You can't grow soup.
So, how's everything?
Terrific.
You'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.
Really?
Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?
I don't know A psychiatrist?
So, hey, how are things with you and Leslie?
To be honest, I don't think it's going to work out.
Oh, that's too bad.
Hey, don't worry.
I'm sure there's someone out there who's just right for you.
What did she mean by that?
!
Was that just a generic platitude, or was that a subtle bid for attention?
You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy?
This is a single-decker hamburger, whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.
This has a much more satisfying meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.
Are you even listening to me?
Of course, I'm listening.
Blah, blah, hopeless Penny delusion Okay, then.
You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Okay, if no one else will say it, I will.
We really suck at paintball.
That was absolutely humiliating.
Oh, come on.
Some battles you win, some battles you lose.
Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah party.
I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage preadolescent Jews.
No, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.
Sheldon, let it go.
No, I wanna talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.
I shot you for a good reason.
You were leading us into disaster.
I was giving clear, concise orders.
You hid behind a tree yelling: "Get the kid in the yarmulke!
Get the kid in the yarmulke"!
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Penny.
- Hello.
- Morning, ma'am.
So how was paintball?
Did you have fun?
Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.
You clear a space on your calendar.
There will be an inquiry.
Okay.
Um.
I'm having a party on Saturday, so if you're around, come by.
- A party?
- Yeah.
A boy-girl party?
There will be boys and there will be girls and it is a party, so.
Just a bunch of my friends, have some beer, do a little dancing.
- Dancing?
- Yeah.
- I don't know, Penny-- - Thing is, we're not-- - We're really more of a-- - No.
But thanks.
Thanks for thinking of us.
Are you sure?
It's Halloween.
A Halloween party?
As in costumes?
Well, yeah.
Is there a theme?
Um, yeah, Halloween.
Yes, but are the costumes random or genre-specific?
As usual, I'm not following.
He's asking if we can come as anyone from science fiction - fantasy.
- Sure.
- Comic books?
- Fine.
- Anime?
- Of course.
TV, film, D&D, manga.
Greek, Roman, Norse gods-- Anything you want.
Okay?
Any costume you want.
Bye.
Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.
I'll get it.
Psshoo.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Make way for the fastest man alive.
Oh, no.
See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.
We all have other costumes.
We can change.
Or we could walk right behind each other all night.
It'll look like one person going really fast.
No, no, no.
It's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
Okay, how about this?
Nobody gets to be the Flash.
We all change.
Agreed?
Agreed.
I call Frodo!
Damn.
Hey.
Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.
- You went with Thor?
- What?
Just because I'm lndian, I can't be a Norse god?
No, no, no, Raj has to be an lndian god.
That's racism.
I mean, look at Wolowitz.
He's not English, but he's dressed like Peter Pan.
Sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously the Doppler effect.
- I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.
- Really?
Because I saw Peter Pan and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby.
She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man.
Sheldon, there's something I wanna talk to you about before we go.
I don't care if anybody gets it, I'm going as the Doppler effect.
- No, it's not that-- - lf I have to, I can demonstrate: Vroom.
Terrific.
Um.
This party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.
What exactly do you mean by embarrass you?
For example, tonight, no one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.
But there's nothing embarrassing about that.
Your father worked with Louis Leakey, a great anthropologist.
It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.
All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group a potential close friend and perhaps more.
I don't wanna look like a dork.
Just a heads up, fellas, if anyone gets lucky I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver.
Oh, hey, guys.
Hey, sorry we're late.
Late?
It's 7:05.
And you said the party starts at 7.
Yeah, I mean, when you start a party at 7, no one shows up at, you know, 7.
It's 7:05.
Yes, yes, it is.
Okay, well, um, come on in.
What, are all the girls in the bathroom?
Probably, but in their own homes.
So, what time does the costume parade start?
The parade?
Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume.
Most frightening, most authentic most accurate visualization of a scientific principle.
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry but there aren't gonna be any parades or judges or prizes.
This party is just going to suck.
No, come on, it's gonna be fun.
And you all look great.
I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan.
That's so cute.
- Actually, Penny, he's Robin-- - I'm Peter Pan.
And I've got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.
No, you don't.
- Hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be?
- Oh, he's the Doppler effect.
Yes, it's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.
Oh, sure, I see it now.
The Doppler effect.
All right, I gotta shower.
You guys, um, make yourselves comfortable.
Okay.
See?
People get it.
Mm.
By Odin's beard, this is good Chex Mix.
No, thanks.
Peanuts.
I can't afford to swell up in these tights.
I'm confused.
If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?
We're socializing, meeting new people.
Telepathically?
- Oh, hey.
When did you get here?
Hi.
Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I've ever seen.
And that includes Halle Berry's.
She's not Catwoman.
She's just a generic cat.
And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.
I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.
- What is your move?
- I'm going to use the mirror technique.
She brushes her hair back, I brush mine.
She shrugs, I shrug.
Subconsciously, she's thinking, "We're in sync.
We belong together".
Where do you get this stuff?
You know, psychology journals, lnternet research.
And there's this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls.
Oh, if only I had his confidence.
I have such difficulty speaking to women or around women, or at times even effeminate men.
If that's a working stethoscope maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat.
No, thanks.
No, seriously, you can.
I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.
I wanna get to know Penny's friends.
I just.
I don't know how to talk to these people.
- Well, I actually might be able to help.
- How so?
Like Jane Goodall observing the apes I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured.
But patterns emerge.
They have their own language, if you will.
Go on.
Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting, "How wasted am l"?
Which is met with an approving chorus of "Dude".
Then what happens?
That's as far as I've gotten.
This is ridiculous.
- I'm jumping in.
- Good luck.
No, you're coming with me.
Oh, I hardly think so.
Come on.
- Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
- Yes, but I need a wingman.
All right, but if we're going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA analyzing wreckage.
Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- Hello.
So, what are you supposed to be?
Me?
I'll give you a hint.
Vroom.
A choo-choo train?
Close.
Vroom.
A brain-damaged choo-choo train?
How wasted am l?
Vroom.
I still don't get it.
I'm the Doppler effect.
Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability I think it's very insensitive.
Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?
Because I'm Frodo.
Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.
- Oh, no.
- What?
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.
What do you suppose he's doing here?
Besides disrupting the local gravity field.
If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.
- Oh, snap.
- Ha-ha.
So I guess we'll be leaving now.
Why should we leave?
For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here.
You have a backup hypothesis?
Maybe they just wanna be friends.
Or maybe she wants to be friends and he wants something more.
Then he and I are on equal ground.
Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is.
Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.
And male partners, animal partners, large primordial eggplants pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.
Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift.
In the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males.
- And we shouldn't have to back down.
- True.
Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?
No.
I'm going to assert my dominance face to face.
Face to face?
Are you gonna wait for him to sit down or you gonna stand on the coffee table?
Hello, Penny.
Hello, Kurt.
Oh, hey, guys.
You having a good time?
Given the reaction to my costume this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.
What?
You're a zebra, right?
Yet another child left behind.
And what are you supposed to be, an elf?
No, I'm a hobbit.
What's the difference?
A hobbit is a mortal, halfling inhabitant of Middle-earth whereas an elf is an immortal, tall warrior.
So why the hell would you wanna be a hobbit?
Because he's neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be the Flash.
Well, whatever.
Why don't you go hop off on a quest?
I'm talking to Penny here.
I think we're all talking to Penny here.
I'm not.
No offense.
Okay, maybe you didn't hear me.
- Go away.
- All right, Kurt, be nice.
Oh, I am being nice.
Right, little buddy?
- Kurt.
- Okay.
I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me.
You can't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery.
You calling me a puffy animal?
Oh, of course not.
No, he's not.
You're not, right, Leonard?
No, I said animalistic.
Of course, we're all animals but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.
If he understands that, you're in trouble.
So what?
I'm unevolved?
You're in trouble.
You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.
Okay, Kurt, please.
Look, Penny, it's okay.
I can handle this.
I am not a dwarf, I'm a hobbit.
A hobbit.
Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?
Okay, now you're starting to make me mad.
A Homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says, "What"?
- What?
- Ha-ha.
I think I've made my point.
Yeah?
How about I make a point out of your pointy little head?
Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.
There's not going to be a confrontation.
In fact, I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.
C-O-N.
Frontation.
- Kurt, put him down this instant.
- He started it.
I don't care, I'm finishing it.
Put him down.
Fine.
You're one lucky little leprechaun.
He's a hobbit.
I got your back.
Leonard, are you okay?
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
It's a good party.
Thanks for having-- It's just getting a little late, so.
Oh.
Okay.
All right.
Well, thank you for coming.
Happy Halloween.
If it's any consolation I thought that Homo habilis line really put him in his place.
- What's that?
- Tea.
When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages.
There, there.
You wanna talk about it?
- No.
- Good.
"There, there" was really all I had.
- Good night, Sheldon.
- Good night, Leonard.
- Hey, Leonard?
- Hi, Penny.
Hey, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I'm fine.
I am so sorry about what happened.
It's not your fault.
Yes, it is.
That's why I broke up with him.
He always does stuff like that.
So why was he at your party?
Well, I ran into him last week and he was just all apologetic about how he's changed.
He was just going on and on, and I believed him.
And I'm an idiot, because I always believe guys like that.
And I can't go back to my party because he's there.
And I know you don't wanna hear this.
I'm upset and really drunk and I just wanna.
There, there.
God, what is wrong with me?
Nothing, you're perfect.
Ecch.
I'm not perfect.
Yes, you are.
You really think so, don't you?
- Penny?
- Yeah?
How much have you had to drink tonight?
Just a lot.
Are you sure that your being drunk and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?
It might.
Boy, you're really smart.
Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.
Leonard, you are so great.
Why can't all guys be like you?
Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive.
I should probably go.
Probably.
Thank you.
That's right, you saw what you saw.
That's how we roll in the Shire.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Watch this, it's really cool.
Call Leonard Hoffstadder.
Did you say: "Call Hellen Boxlightner?
Call Leonard Hoffstadder.
Did you say: "Call Temple Badsaidor"?
Let me try!
Call Calling "Rajesh Koothrappali".
That's very impressive.
And a little racist.
If we're all through playing "mock the flawed technology," can we get on with Halo night?
We were supposed to start at So we'll start now.
First we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.
We could split it two, two and two.
If we're having anchovies on the pizza, we can't take it out of bathroom time.
Oh, what fresh hell is this?
- Hey, Penny.
Come on in.
- Hey, guys.
See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you'll have good luck.
No, you won't.
Can I hide out here for a while?
Sure.
What's going on?
There's this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christy.
She called me up, and she's like, "Hey, how's California"?
And I'm like, "Awesome," 'cause, you know, it's not Nebraska.
And the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me.
Anyway, she got here today and she's just been in my apartment yakity yakking about every guy she slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.
Is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she throw it all in like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?
- He really needs to dial it down.
- I know.
So if you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
She was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.
I apologize for my earlier outburst.
Who needs Halo, when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the Whore of Omaha?
I don't think she's a whore.
No, yeah, she's definitely a whore.
I mean, she has absolutely no standards.
This one time she was at Where's Howard?
Bonjour, mademoiselle.
I understand you're new in town.
Oh, good grief.
I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing Halo.
Fine.
We'll just play one-on-one until he gets back.
One-on-one?
We don't play one-on-one.
We play teams, not one-on-one.
One-on-one.
The only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
Sure, cut the foreigner in half.
There's a billion more where he came from.
If you guys need a fourth, I'll play.
- Great idea.
- No.
The wheel was a great idea, relativity was a great idea.
This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.
Why?
Why?
Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.
What, what, what?
This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve.
There are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate backstory.
Oh cool.
Whose head did I just blow off?
Mine.
Okay, I got this.
Lock and load, boys.
It's the only way we can play teams.
Yes, but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience, and not to mention the fact There goes your head again.
It's not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just re-spawned.
You need to give them a chance to Now, come on!
Raj, Raj!
She's got me cornered.
Cover me!
Cover this, suckers!
- Penny, you are on fire!
- Yes, and so is Sheldon.
Okay, that's it.
I don't know how, but she is cheating.
No one can be that attractive and this skilled at a video game.
Wait, Sheldon, come back.
You forgot something.
What?
This plasma grenade.
Look, it's raining you.
You laugh now-- you just wait until you need tech support.
Gosh, he's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?
To be fair, he's also a rather unpleasant winner.
Well, it's been fun.
We make such a good team.
Maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
Or we could just have a life.
I guess for you that's an option.
- Good night.
- Good night.
As usual, nice talking to you, Raj.
What do you suppose she meant by that?
She's an enigma, Raj.
And another thing-- there's a certain ethic to the game, Penny, - a well- established - She's gone.
She could have said good-bye.
Okay, I have a problem.
It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.
What's wrong?
Howard and Christy are kind of hooking up in my bedroom.
Are you sure?
I grew up on a farm, okay?
From what I heard, they're either having sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine.
Do you mind if I stay here tonight?
No, take the couch, or my bed.
I just got new pillows.
Hypo-allergenic.
The couch is good.
Hold that thought.
Leonard, a moment.
Let me guess.
You have a problem with this.
- Where do I begin?
- It's up to you.
Crazy person's choice.
First, we don't have houseguests.
Frankly, if I could afford the rent, I'd ask you to leave.
Your friendship means a lot to me as well.
What else?
Well our earthquake supplies.
We have a two-man, two-day kit.
So?
So if there's an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.
I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?
No one ever thinks it'll happen until it does.
If you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.
- What?
- He's engaging in reductio ad absurdum.
It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticizing the result.
And I do not appreciate it.
I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.
Okay, since I'm obviously being ignored here, let's go over the morning schedule.
I use the bathroom from 7:00 to 7:20.
Plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.
How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
I suggest no liquids after 11:00 p.m. - Here you go.
- Thanks, Leonard.
Wrong.
I'm listening.
Your head goes on the other end.
- Why?
- It's culturally universal.
A bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door.
It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.
I'll risk it.
Anything else should I know?
Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I'll jump out that window.
Please don't come to my funeral.
Have a good night.
Sorry about that.
- That's okay.
- FYI-- his toothbrush is the red one in the Plexiglas case under the UV light.
Got it.
- Sleep tight.
- Thanks Funny expression, "sleep tight".
It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes, which would occasionally Sleep tight.
What are you doing?
Every Saturday since we've lived in this apartment I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of two percent milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America, and watched Doctor Who.
Penny's still sleeping.
Every Saturday since we've lived in this apartment I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl I know.
You have a TV in your room.
Why don't you just have breakfast in bed?
Because I am neither an invalid, nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.
What time is it?
Almost 6:30.
I slept all day?
No, it's 6:30 in the morning.
What the hell is your problem?
Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity.
I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.
Hola, nerd-migos.
Why do you people hate sleep?
Are you wearing my robe?
Yeah.
Sorry, I'll have it cleaned.
That's okay, keep it.
- Where's Christy?
- In the shower.
By the way, where did you get that loofah mitt?
Yours reaches places that mine just won't.
You used my loofah?
More precisely, weused your loofah.
I exfoliated her brains out.
You can keep that, too.
Then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.
In here, milady!
Here's my little engine that could.
There's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
Hi.
Christy.
- I'm Sheldon.
- Right.
You're Howard's entourage.
So, Christy, what are your plans?
Howard said he'd take me shopping in Beverly Hills.
Yeah, no, I meant plans to find someplace to live.
Other than with me.
Not that I don't love having you, but it's It's a little crowded.
Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us.
Oh, terrific.
Now we're running a cute little B & B. Let me offer a little outside-the-box thinking here.
Why doesn't Christy stay with me?
- You live with your mother.
- I do not.
My mother lives with me.
Then it's all settled.
Christy will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who.
Although at this point, it's more like Doctor Why Bother?
- Sheldon, you just can't dictate - No more talking!
Everybody go!
So what do you say?
Want to repair to Casa Wolowitz?
What is that, like a Mexican deli?
I'm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier.
My last name is Wolowitz.
That's so cool.
My first Jew.
I imagine there aren't very many Kosher Cornhuskers.
But you're still taking me shopping?
Anything you want.
Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.
When they perfect human cloning, I'm going to order 12 of those.
Can't you see she's using you?
Who cares?
Last night, she pulled off her blouse and I wept.
I know her.
Okay?
She'll have sex with anyone, as long as they keep buying her things.
- Really?
- Yeah.
If you'll excuse me, I have some Bar Mitzvah bonds to cash.
I'm sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
We can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
Let me walk you through it.
Our standard order is: the steamed dumpling appetizer, General Tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo mein.
Do you see the problem?
I see a problem.
Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided amongst four people.
- So, we'll just order three entrees.
- Fine.
What do you want to eliminate?
And who gets the extra dumpling?
We could cut it into thirds.
Then it's no longer a dumpling.
Once you cut it open it is, at best, a very small open-faced sandwich.
Hi, fellas.
Where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?
He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good.
Where he comes from, that's punishable by death.
I come from Sacramento.
Can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four?
No substitutions.
This isn't a substitution.
It's a reduction.
Okay.
No reductions.
Fine.
Bring us three orders of dumplings.
- That's 12.
We'll each have four.
- That works.
If we fill up on dumplings, we need to eliminate another entree.
No eliminations.
If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.
And divide it how?
I'm telling you, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend.
If you had let me invite Penny, then you would have had your fourth.
Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food?
She uses a fork and she double-dips her egg rolls.
- We don't order egg rolls.
- Exactly, but we'd have to if she was here!
Can we please make a decision?
Not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here.
There's an idea.
Why don't we just go out for Indian food?
You're nice boys.
Tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to bring you the four dumplings.
When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings fall to the floor.
No one has to know.
I'll know.
- How about soup?
- Yeah, we can always divide soup.
What about the wontons?
Hey, guys, what's up?
It's Halo night.
So?
With Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christy She's not my friend.
Friends do not get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.
Right.
Anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you.
Yes.
We would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team.
I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is.
That's so sweet, but I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.
You can't go out; it's Halo night.
- Well, for Penny, it's dancing night.
- You go dancing every Wednesday?
- No.
- Then that's not "dancing night".
Why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?
Tonight is Halo night.
It's like talking to a wall.
All right, now, Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.
Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.
Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.
All right, fellas, I gotta go.
But good luck.
Maybe we should've asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.
Assuming we could dance-- which we can't-- there are three of us and two of them.
So?
It's the Chinese restaurant all over again.
I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.
For God's sakes, Sheldon, you're driving me crazy!
Your anger is not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.
I'm pretty sure my anger is with you.
What's happening to us?
We're falling apart.
- Who are you calling?
- The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
Hi, this is Howard Wolowitz.
And this is Christy Vanderbelt.
We can't get to the phone right now because we're having sex!
You're not going to put that on your message, are you?
Nah, I'm just kidding.
I'll re-record it.
Sheldon, think this through.
You're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.
No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo Three.
As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include Hi-Def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.
You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.
My point.
You can take the damn plastic off the couch once in a while!
Why, so you and Howard can hump on it?
!
Ladies, ladies, I'm sure there's a middle ground.
Shut up, Howard!
You guys talk.
I'm gonna take my scooter out for a little spin.
You happy?
You drove your own son out of the house.
Why don't you stop What are you doing here?
It's Halo night.
He's not a man, he's a putz!
And don't you take that tone with me, you gold digger!
- What'd you call me?
- You heard me!
And I'll tell you something else, you're barking up the wrong tree.
'Cause as long as you're around, Howard is out of the will!
You know what?
I got better offers.
I'm outta here.
That's right.
Go back to Babylon, you whore!
So, Halo night, huh?
I thought she was the whore of Omaha.
Sheldon, you got him in your sights!
Fire!
He's charging his plasma rifle!
I can't shoot now.
I'm cloaking!
- Raj!
Kill Sheldon!
- I can't see him!
That's why they call it cloaking, dead man!
- Start throwing grenades!
- I'm all out!
Hey, guys.
My friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you.
Raj, hop in the tank!
- We said no tanks!
- There are no rules in hell!
Son of a bitch.
Med pack!
I need a med pack!
Told ya.
There's a sniper.
Use your rocket launcher!
All I've got is a Needler and I'm all out of ammo!
And now you're out of life.
Why'd you hit pause?
I thought I heard something.
What?
No, never mind.
Sorry.
Go.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Damn you, walletnook.com!
Problem?
The online description was completely misleading.
They said: "8 slots plus removable ID".
To any rational person, that would mean room for nine cards.
But they don't tell you the removable ID takes up one slot.
It's a nightmare.
Do you really need the Honorary Justice League of American membership card?
It's been in every wallet I've owned since I was five.
Why?
It says, "Keep this on your person at all times".
It's right here under Batman's signature.
and this is Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.
Guess whose parents just got broadband.
Leonard, may I present, live from New Delhi, Dr. and Mrs. V. M. Koothrappali.
Hi!
Tilt up the camera up!
I'm looking at his crotch.
Sorry, Papa.
Oh, that's much better.
Hi.
And over here is Sheldon.
He lives with Leonard.
That's nice.
Like Haroon and Tanvir.
Not like Haroon and Tanvir.
Such sweet young men.
They just adopted the cutest little Punjabi baby.
No, we're not like Haroon and Tanvir.
So, are you boys academics like our son?
Yes.
And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential?
- Oh, yes.
- Not at all.
Papa, please.
Don't start.
It was just a question.
He's so sensitive.
That's my life.
That's my friends.
Good to see you.
Say good-bye.
- Bye.
- Wait!
Wait!
Before you go, we have good news.
Put the computer down and gather your friends.
- What is it, Papa?
- Friends!
Is it just me, or does web chatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless?
Do you rember Lalita Gupta?
The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable?
Yes.
Well, now she's a dental student at USC, so we gave her your contact information.
Why did you do that?
You're 26 years old, Rajesh.
We want grandchildren.
- But, Papa, I'm not supposed - Lalita's parents approved the match.
If you decide on a spring wedding, we can avoid monsoon season.
A spring wedding?
!
It's up to you, dear.
We don't want to meddle.
If you don't want to meddle, then why are you?
If I may, your parents probably don't consider this meddling.
While arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater-than-average involvement in their children's love lives.
Why are you telling me about my own culture?
You seemed confused.
Sorry, but with all due respect, I really don't want to I'm sorry, darling.
We have to go.
Doogie Howser is on.
Grandma!
It's Doogie Time!
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!
I don't believe it.
Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like 20 years.
Actually, I read somewhere that it's one of the most popular programs in India.
It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one's children enter the medical profession.
I bet you're right.
- I bet they loveScrubs.
- What's not to love?
Excuse me!
Hello?
My parents are trying to marry me to a total stranger.
What am I going to do?
I suggest you go through with it.
What?
!
Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the 19th century.
Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well.
It's the entire premise of Fiddler on the Roof.
I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show.
Me too.
Of course, it speaks to me culturally.
Understandable, but there's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity.
Let's not forget it's got some really catchy tunes.
- I know what I'm going to do.
- What?
Find new friends.
So who wants to rent Fiddler?
No need, we have the special edition.
Maybe we are like Haroon and Tanvir.
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium.
Well, I'm sorry, too, but there's just no room for you in my wallet.
I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have dinosaurs.
I'll miss you, too.
Bye-bye.
Okay, I know you're texting about me and I'd really like you to stop.
Oh, dear, I am rightly and truly screwed.
Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.
I've got some feelers out.
In the meantime, listen to this.
Hi, Rajesh.
This is Lalita Gupta.
Your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me.
So, I'm calling you and call me back.
Bye.
Can you believe how pushy she is?
So don't call her.
If I don't call her, I won't hear the end of it from my parents.
- So call her.
- How?
You know I can't talk to women.
I'm done.
Anybody else?
- Give me the phone.
- Why?
Just give it to me.
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry.
You'll thank me.
Hello, Lalita?
Raj Koothrappali here.
Yes, it is good to talk to you, too.
So what are you wearing?
Oh, not important.
So, anyhow, when would you like to meet?
Friday works for me!
I'll call you with a time and place.
But in the meantime, keep it real, babe.
You may now thank me.
For what?
Making me sound like a Simpsons character?
Next time make your own date.
- I didn't want this one!
- Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.
Great, then we'll get married, I won't be able to talk to her and we'll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.
It worked for my parents.
Hi, guys.
I need some guinea pigs.
There's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try.
But if your research is going to have human applications, may I suggest white mice instead?
Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
I swear to God, one day, I'm going to get the hang of talking to you.
His mom's been saying that for years.
What's up?
I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bartending shift, so I need to practice mixing drinks.
Great.
The key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.
With certain obvious exceptions.
Suicide, for example.
So, Leonard, how about it?
We'd love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now, besides, he doesn't drink, so Really?
Raj is going through some stuff right now and he'd like to take up drinking.
Here you go, Leonard.
One Tequila Sunrise.
Thank you.
This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container.
Thank you.
Okay, Raj, what'll it be?
Whatever you recommend.
How about a Grasshopper?
I make a mean Grasshopper.
Okay?
Good.
Coming up.
Sheldon, what are you going to have?
I'll have a Diet Coke.
Can you please order a cocktail?
I need to practice mixing drinks.
Fine.
I'll have a Virgin Cuba Libre.
That's, rum and Coke without the rum.
Yes.
So Coke.
Yes.
And would you make it diet?
There's a can in the fridge.
A Cuba Libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
Then swim to Cuba.
Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
Raj, here you go.
All right.
Who's next?
I'd like to try a Slippery Nipple.
Okay, you're cut off.
Anybody need a refill?
Where did my life go, Penny?
One day I'm a carefree bachelor, and the next I'm married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
Are you talking to me?
Is the another Penny here?
I had such plans.
I had dreams.
I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astrophysics.
But with a penis, of course.
- Amazing.
- Ever since I was a little boy, my father wanted me to be a gynecologist like him.
How can I be a gynecologist?
I can barely look a woman in the eye!
You know what?
I'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer.
It's time for a showdown.
Somebody give me a computer with a webcam!
Sweetie, I think that's the Grasshopper talking.
And it's about to tell my parents that I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.
Okay, calm down.
No one can make you get married.
Why don't you just meet this girl and see what happens?
Haven't you been listening to me?
I cannot talk to women.
No, no, let's see how long it takes him.
Raj, honey, you say you can't talk to women, but you've been talking to me.
And now we'll never know.
You're right.
I am talking to you.
Hello, Penny, how are you?
- I'm fine.
- Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the Grasshopper.
It's a sweet, green miracle.
If you're going to drink on this date, just promise me you won't overdo it.
Overdo what?
Happiness?
Freedom?
This warm glow inside of me that promises everything's going to be all hunky-dunky?
Yeah, that.
Why don't you bring her to my restaurant while I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you.
What's the plan here?
Let's say he meets her, he likes her, they get married.
What's he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?
Worked for my parents.
I can't believe I'm sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta.
Well, you are.
Little Lalita.
That's kind of fun to say.
Little Lalita, little Lalita, little Lalita.
- You should try it.
- Oh, it's okay.
You have lost so much weight.
That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat.
Do you remember?
Yes, I do.
Of course you do.
Who could forget being that fat?
I've been trying.
So you're a dental student.
Are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate?
Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers, you're still winning.
Yay, me.
Do you have a drink that will make him less obnoxious?
Drinks do not work that way.
I'd say he's doing fine.
Look at her.
The last girl my mom set me up with had a mustache and a vestigial tail.
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?
Nothing.
I just really didn't want to come.
Virgin diet Cuba Libre, please.
In a tall glass with a lime wedge.
Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.
So how's Koothrappali Oh, my Lord.
- What?
- That's Princess Panchali.
I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.
No, no, Princess Panchali, fromThe Monkey and the Princess.
Oh, yeah.
I tried to watch that online, but they wanted my credit card.
It's a children's story.
Oh, no, it isn't.
When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me.
It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different.
For some reason, I related to it quite strongly.
I know the reason.
We all know the reason.
Sheldon, what are you getting at?
That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Panchali in the book.
How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
Every year at Comic-Con.
Every day at Disneyland.
You can hire Snow White to come to your house.
Of course, they prefer it if you have a kid.
Hey, guys.
This is Lalita Gupta.
Lalita, this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny.
Isn't it great?
She isn't fat anymore.
"Forgive me, Your Highness, for I am but a monkey, "and it is in my nature to climb.
"I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair".
I'm sorry?
You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Panchali.
Oh, no kidding.
Who is that?
A beloved character from an Indian folktale.
Us Indian or "Come to our casino" Indian?
You Indian.
The resemblance is remarkable.
I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.
Well, thanks.
I imagine you smell very nice, too.
I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
Really?
So do I. But you're a dentist.
He's nuts.
Don't be insulting, Rajesh.
So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.
It was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.
- Oh, my.
- Back off, Sheldon.
What?
If you do not stop hitting on my lady, you'll feel the full extent of my wrath.
I'm not hitting on her.
And I am not your lady.
And you have no wrath.
You are my lady.
Our parents said so.
We are, for all intents and purposes, 100% hooked up.
Let's get something straight here.
The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case.
I certainly don't need to be getting this Old World crap from you.
That's exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Panchali led the monkeys to freedom.
- Screw Princess Panchali.
- You can't talk to me like that.
But you're not Princess Panchali.
Luckily for you-- she could have you beheaded.
Sheldon, are you hungry?
- I could eat.
- Let's go.
What just happened?
Beats the hell out of me.
I'll tell you what happened.
I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks.
What are we supposed to say to Lalita's parents?
I play golf with her father.
I won't be able to look at him.
Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa.
Oh, now you're a funny man.
This is not funny, Mr. Funny Man.
Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.
This is a family matter, Sheldon.
I'm Leonard.
Sorry.
You all look alike to us.
But he's right, Papa.
Listen to him.
You!
You are the one who ruined everything.
Who is it?
We can't see.
Turn us.
Turn us!
Go ahead, tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren.
How would I know?
Do you have a low sperm count?
This has nothing to do with my sperm count.
You are wearing the boxers that we sent you, aren't you?
- Yes, Mumi.
- Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear tighty-whities.
Can we please stop talking about my testicles?
Sheldon, tell them what you did.
What did I do?
You left with his date.
Friends don't do that to each other.
All right, noted.
Sorry.
Sorry?
That's all you can say is sorry?
Take it.
It's more than I've ever gotten.
May I point out, she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring.
- Drunk?
- And boring-- her words.
I knew it.
He moves to America and he becomes an alcoholic.
I'm not an alcoholic.
Then why were you drunk?
- It was just this one time, I swear.
- Are you in denial?
Do we have to come over and do an intervention?
Don't embarrass him in front of his friends.
All right.
Carry us outside.
We want to talk to you in private.
- But, Papa, please - Now, Rajesh!
I have to go.
Now, listen to me At least wait till I get into the hall.
Okay, well, good night.
Hold on.
What happened with you and Lalita?
We ate, she lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks-- nothing I didn't already know-- and I came home.
So you're not going to see her again?
Why would I see her again?
I already have a dentist.
I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren?
I don't believe it.
What's gotten into him?
Oh, maybe a couple virgin Cuba Libres that turned out to be kind of slutty.
You didn't.
You do your experiments.
I do mine.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Ok The X10's are online Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP racing down fibre optic cable at the speed of light to San Fransisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be headed off to submerge transatlantic cables, terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia and transfered across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP And the extend receiver attached to this Lamp.
Look at me, look at me.
I've got goosebumps.
- Are we ready for the stereo?
- Go for stereo.
- Hey guys.
- Hello.
It's a little loud.
No problem Turning it down.
San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax et voilÃ !
- OK, thanks.
- Hang on, hang on.
Do you not realise what we just did?
Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.
No, we turned our stereo down, by sending a signal around the world via the Internet.
Oh.
You know you can get one of those universal remotes from Radioshack?
They're really cheap.
No, you don't get it.
Howard, - Enable public access.
- Public access enabled.
- Boy, that's terrific.
I'll see ya.
- No hang on, hang on See?
No.
Someone in Sichuan province, China, is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.
Oh, that's handy.
Here's a question Why?
Because we can.
They found our remote control cars!
- Wait, what's on top of that?
- Wireless webcams, wave hello!
The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
- You may want to put on slacks.
- What?
Ew, stop it!
No!
Leave me alone!
- Who's running the red Corvette?
- That would be me.
The Big Bang Theory - Season 1 - Episode 9 You know in the future, when we're disembodied brains in jars, we're going to look at this as eight hours well wasted.
I don't want to be in a jar.
I want my brain in an android body.
Eight feet tall and ribbed.
I'm with you.
I just have to make sure if I'm a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish.
I promised my mother.
I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised.
But that's something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer.
Not to mention you'd have to power down on saturdays.
Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter but Occam's rasor would suggest that someone threw it out.
It's from the Institute of Experimental Physics, they want us to present our paper on the properties of supersolids at the topical conference of Bose-Einstein condensates.
I know.
I read it before I threw it out.
Ok, if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question: why did you throw it out?
Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose room of the Pasadena Marriot, in front of a group of judgmental strangers who wouldn't recognise true genius if it was standing in front of them giving a speech.
Which if I were there, would be.
I don't know Sheldon.
Those topical conferences on Bose-Einstein condensates' parties are legendary - Forget the parties!
- Forget the parties?
What a nerd.
Are there any other honours I've got that I don't know about?
Did the UPS dropped off a Nobel prize with my name on it?
Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag coefficient of tassles on flying carpets.
the only thing missing from that insult was: "your mama".
I got one Hey Leonard, - Your mama's research methodology is so flawed - Shut up, Howard.
- Sheldon, we have to do this.
- No, we don't.
We have to take a nourishment, to expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep our cells from dying.
Everything else is optional.
Ok, let me put it this way: I'm doing it.
You can't.
I'm the lead author.
Come on, the only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically.
I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation with dealing with the fact that it was my idea.
Now to put too fine a point to it, but I was throwing you a bone.
You're welcome.
Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.
That doesn't mean proving.
So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
They're not supposed to, but they should.
Alright, I don't care what you say.
I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings And I forbid it.
You forbid it?
If I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is.
- So, you admit that it's our work.
- No.
Once again, I'm throwing you a bone.
And once again, you are welcome.
So, how's it going with Sheldon?
Are you guys still not talking to each other?
Not only is he still not talking to me, but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode.
You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie "Scanners"?
Like.
Bzzz.
Nevermind.
How about this one?
It says, I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy.
Oh, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits.
They don't, that's why I saved this one.
Ok, well, let's just see what else you have.
Ok, here.
Take this.
and this, and this, and this, and these Is this all stuff you want me to try on?
No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.
Seriously, don't even give it to charity, you won't be helping anyone.
What's this?
That's the bottled city of Kandor.
You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton.
It was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.
Oh, nice.
It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
Here, why don't you put these while I find a shirt and a sport cut match.
Right, be right back.
Where are you going?
Just put them on.
Here?
Oh, are you shy?
- No, I'm not shy.
- Don't worry I won't look.
I know you won't look.
Why would you look?
There's nothing to see Well, not 'nothing' Sweetie, put the pants on.
So, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could - compromise on this whole presentation thing?
- No, No.
Scientists do not compromise.
Our minds are trained to synthetize facts and come to inarguable conclusions.
Not to mention, Sheldon is back-crap crazy.
What is this?
Oh, careful.
That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.
Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?
Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
Ok, alright, moving on.
Oh, wow.
A paisley shirt.
It goes with my corduroy suit.
if you mean it should end up in the same place, then I agree.
Is this your only tie?
Technically, yes.
But, if you'll notice It's reversible!
So it works as two.
Sweetie, I don't even think it works as one.
- Is this all your clothes?
- Eh, yeah.
Everything since the eighth grade.
- The eighth grade?
- My last growth sprout Ok, well, let's go back to the curdoroy suit.
- Great.
- Yeah.
I said no.
Put it down.
Hey Sheldon.
Hello Penny.
Get anything good?
Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics quarterly.
Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't.
It was a joke.
Yep.
Tip you waitresses.
I'm here all week.
Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness, know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.
Oh, yeah ok, me too.
Zip it, lock it.
Put it in your pocket.
- So, you and Leonard - Oh dear God Little misunderstanding, huh?
A little misunderstanding?
Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.
Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.
How do you feel?
I don't understand the question.
I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.
I haven't thought about it like that.
I wonder if I've been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil Wait, what?
I couldn't poop this morning.
You should just talk to him, I'm sure you guys can work this out.
- Certainly preferable to my plan.
- Which was?
A powerful laxative.
You absolutely should talk to him.
Look, I know Leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself without your little idea there's no way he could come up with this whole experiment thing.
Excuse me.
"Little idea"?
Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, - I didn't really understand it but - Of course you didn't.
He said: "Little idea"?
Oh, well, no Not - Not in those words.
- In what words then, exactly?
Oh, you know Gee.
The exact words are It's more the spirit in which he said - What did he say?
- You had a lucky hunch Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this Don't you ever speak to me again.
What?
Ok, I'm leaving for the conference.
Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch" Shel, I didn't mean it like that.
- Then why did you say it?
- I don't know, I wasn't - Were you trying to impress Penny?
- No, no, not at all.
A little bit.
How did that work out for you?
- Leonard, ready to go?
- Libido: 1 Truth: 0.
Ok, I'm gonna ask you one more time.
We did the work together, let's present the paper together.
And I'm telling you for the last time, it's pandering, it's undignifying, and bite me.
Let's go.
- Bye Sheldon.
- Goodbye Penny.
One of these days bshh!
There you go.
You're right this side does look better.
No, no, I didn't say better, I said "less stained".
I just checked the house.
There's probably 20-25 people in there.
- You're kidding!
- Is that all?
"All"?
In particle physics 25 is Woodstock!
- Then good!
- I wasn't expecting such a crowd, I'm all nervous.
It's ok, just open with a joke, you'll be fine.
A joke Ok.
How about this?
Um, ok There's this farmer and he has these chickens but they won't lay any eggs, so he calls a physicist to help.
The physicist then does some calculations, and he says: "I have a solution, but it only works for spherical chickens in a vacuum".
Right?
Oh, sorry, I just had heard it before.
- Let's roll.
Hey, nice suit.
- It's a classic, right?
I really should have brought my own car.
So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and a solid becomes a supersolid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.
Thank you!
- Are there any questions?
- Yeah.
What the hell was that?
Any other questions?
Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper.
Thank you.
And you sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park and I saw these children on a merry-go-round which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gases like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero.
I didn't skip it.
It's just an anecdote, it's not science.
Oh, I see.
It was the apple falling on Newton's head, - was that just an anecdote?
- You are not Isaac Newton.
No, no, that's true.
Gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.
You cannot possibly be that arrogant.
You continue to underestimate me, my good man.
Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me!
As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don't need validation from lesser minds.
No offense.
Really, so why did you come?
Because I knew you'd screw this up.
I didn't screw it up!
Oh, please.
I admit that spherical chicken joke, - that was hilarious.
- Thank you.
But it was straight downhill from there.
I've had enough of your condescendship.
Maybe I didn't go to college when I was 11 like you.
Maybe I got my doctorate at but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room!
No offense.
And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation!
So you admit you're an egotist?
Yes!
My name is doctor Leonard Hofstadter and I can never please my parents so I need all my self esteem from strangers like you!
But he's worse!
Ok, that's it!
Stop it!
You cannot blow up my head with your mind!
Then I'll settle for your aneurism!
- Stop it!
- You hit me!
You saw that he hit me!
You tried to blow up my head!
So it was working!
It wa It was not!
You're a nutcase!
We'll see about that!
Heads up, you people in the front row!
This is a splash zone!
Stop it!
Just quit it!
Is this usually how these physics things go?
More often than you think.
You could have offered me a ride home.
You're lucky I didn't run you over.
I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about.
You begged me to come, I came.
There's just no pleasing you.
You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help.
Well, that's not much of an apology but I'll take it.
Excuse me, is there anything you would apologise for?
Yes.
I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.
It was uncalled for.
You won't believe this.
Somebody got the whole thing with their cell phone and put it on YouTube!
What?
- Who would do that?
- That would be me.
Hey, check it out, it's a featured video!
He hit me!
You saw that he hit me!
You tried to blow up my head!
- Then it was working!
- It was not working!
You're a nutcase!
We will see about that!
You people in the front row heads up!
This is splash zone Stop it!
Leave it, leave it!
You want a volcano nerve pinch!
You should clip your fingernails!
Those hurt!
Oh, Jeez.
does this suit really look that bad?
Forget your suit, look at my arms waving.
I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.
Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned "me and my girlfriend"?
Uh oh, here comes the talk.
- You hit me!
- You tried to blow up my head!
- So it was working!
- It was not working!
You're a nutcase!
We will see about that!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
no,see,the liquid-metal termators were created in the future by skynet, and skynet was developed by miles dyson, but that future no longer exists due to dyson's death in terminator 2.
Okay,then riddle me this: Assuming all the good terminators were originally evil terminators created by skynet but then reprogrammed by the future john connor,why would skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite, hot, 17-year-old killer robot?
Skynet is kinky?
I don't know.
Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.
All right.
Wait!
They use it to.
too late.
I win.
What the hell is that?
I don't know, but if cats could sing, they'd hate it,too.
Hey,guys!
Hi!
Where you going?
What?
We just had to mail some letters and throw away some chicken.
You'll never guess what just happened.
Oh, I give up.
I don't guess.
As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation.
although as I'm saying this, it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
What was that?
Believe it or not, personal growth.
What happened?
All right, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of rent, but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why.
I have a conclusion based on an observation.
No,you don't.
No,he doesn't.
Well,the girl they picked to play mimi-- she dropped out, and they asked me to replace her.
Congratulations.
What a lucky break.
It's not that big a deal, just a one-night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents.
So, you never know!
No,you don't.
He doesn't.
It's this Friday night at 8:00.
You guys want to come?
No.
Because, Friday we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.
I think that's a week from Tuesday, at 6:00.
No,it's this Friday.
At 8:00.
Oh, too bad.
Well, I gotta get to rehearsal.
See you guys.
You just lied to penny.
Yes, I did.
And you did it so casually -- no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.
So?
So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath.
Sheldon, are you worried about your safety?
No, I imagine if you were going to kill me, you'd have done it a long time ago.
That's very true.
Proudly Presents Leonard?
What?
I need to speak to you.
It's 2 o'clock in the morning!
It's important.
I highly doubt that.
Go away.
Are you still out there?
Yes.
What?
You're right; it can wait until morning.
What, what, what, what, what?
Never mind.
I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle.
You're in no state of mind to talk.
Sheldon, what is it?
I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.
What was I supposed to say?
You could have told her the truth.
That would have hurt her feelings.
Is that a relevant factor?
Yes.
Then I suppose you could've agreed to go.
And what would I have said afterwards?
I would suggest something to the effect of: Singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I'd recommend you have a CAT scan to look for a tumor pressing on the cognitive processing centers of your brain.
I couldn't say that.
I would have to say, "you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again".
Why?
It's the social protocol.
It's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at.
I was not aware of that.
Well, now you are.
Alright.
Leonard?
Yes?
When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and I can't wait to play you again.
Good night.
Leonard?
This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.
What?
I was analyzing our lie, and I believe we're in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.
How?
click on "epcoming events," scroll down to "seminars," download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippity, boppity, boo-- our pants are metaphorically on fire.
Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
Penny?
Good morning.
Do you have any idea what time it is?
Of course I do.
My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado.
It's accurate to one-tenth of a second.
But as I'm saying this, it occurs to me that, once again, your question may have been rhetorical.
What do you want?
Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
I remember "symposium".
Yes.
Well, he lied.
Wait.
What?
He lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.
Well, imagine how I'm feeling.
Hungry?
Tired?
I'm sorry, this really isn't my strong suit.
You told her I lied?
Why would you tell her I lied?
To help you.
I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.
She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me.
I'm getting a bad feeling.
Hunger?
Indigestion?
I'm sorry, I'm really not very good at this.
Anyway, Penny now believes that, on Friday night, we're going to participate in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention.
Your cousin Leopold.
Who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee.
Remember that.
It's important.
What's important?
Details, Leonard-- the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.
Do you have a cousin Leopold?
No.
I made him up.
I think you'd call him Lee.
I don't get it.
I already told her a lie.
Why replace it with a different lie?
Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted.
While you were sleeping, I was weaving an un-unravelable web.
Un-unravelable?
Yes.
If she googles "Leopold Houston," she'll find a Facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use and a desperate yet hopeful listing on eharmony.com.
Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousin?
Because it's in Long Beach, and I don't drive.
We're going to Long Beach?
No, of course not.
There's no cousin Leo.
There's no intervention.
Focus, Leonard.
Aw, come on.
We just leave the house on Friday night and we return in the wee hours, emotionally wrung out, from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.
He goes back into rehab?
Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to hear her sing again.
You still told her I lied.
For a noble purpose-- to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin-- which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
How am I supposed to remember all of this?
Oh, that's the best part.
You don't have to.
See,I told Penny that you would be embarrassed if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie is still in force.
So she's expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when, in actuality, we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach.
Un-unravelable.
Oh, hey, Penny.
Wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase.
You look great.
Thanks.
I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.
Well, thank you.
You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are.
You are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when, when he has a symposium to go to.
I don't know what to say.
It's okay, Leonard.
Oh, okay, all right, good.
Oh, boy, group hug.
So, what's up?
Well, Penny is on her way to perform in a one-night showcase production of rent, which we are unable to attend, because we're going to a symposium on molecular positronium given by Dr. Emil Farmanfarmian.
Wait a minute-- Farmanfarmian is speaking and you're bogarting the symposium?
Howard, I'm sorry.
No, no, you're quark-blocking us.
I dot know what to say.
Howard, listen.
No, it's okay.
It's your millennium falcon.
You and chewbacca do whatever you want to do.
Me and princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.
Howard, wait.
Sheldon, I think we should tell them.
Okay, sure.
I don't see a problem with that.
There's no symposium.
Leonard lied to me.
Isn't that right, Leonard?
Well.
I don't know what to say!
It's okay; I do.
Look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis.
He made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr. Farman farmian.
Good for you.
because he didn't want sheldon to be embarrassed.
And there is nothing to be embarrassed about, okay?
Every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.
No, I'm lost, too.
I think she skipped a step.
No, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a motel 8 in Long Beach.
The whole family's going out for an intervention.
Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this, because he's such a good man.
Oh, another hug?
Thank you.
All right, you guys, good luck.
Thanks, Penny.
Oh-- break a leg.
Break a leg.
So, road trip to Long Beach.
No.
We're not going to Long Beach.
Why not?
Because sheldon doesn't have a drug-addicted cousin Leopold.
Oh, too bad.
I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.
It's a very nice community.
The Queen Marry is docked there.
Once the largest ocean liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant, where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.
- Sounds fun.
- I'm game.
- Shotgun!
No, no, no.
Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then, it's iffy.
Wait, are we, really going to Long Beach?
Leonard?
Let it go, Sheldon.
The murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.
No, that's the least of our worries.
I've been doing some research on addiction-- both the biochemical and behavioral aspects-- and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie.
What are you talking about?
It's fine-- she bought it; it's over.
Sadly, it's not.
Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that, I have realized that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.
Why not?
Because Leo's a middle child.
There is no Leo!
How can you say that?
You didn't read the bio, did you?
He's not just a middle child, he is the quintessential middle child-- from a broken home, to boot.
Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling, even to the point of self-destruction, is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.
I've got a solution.
Great.
What is it?
Get out!
Fine.
I've hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit.
I'm just trying to clean up after your mess.
We'll talk in the morning.
Morning.
Who are you?
I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.
Sheldon does not have a cousin leo.
Au contraire.
I'm 26 years old.
I'm originally from Denton, Texas, but I was a navy brat, so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world.
As a result, I've often felt like an outsider-- never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse probloem.
Excuse me, we just went over this.
As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.
Oh,Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology?
For your information, this is all based on solid research.
Just stick with the character profile I wrote for you.
Sheldon?
I'm sorry.
Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld.
He's a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theater at MIT.
It was more of a double major, actually.
Theater and physics.
You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me toward.
Yeah, I got it.
Sheldon.
Why?
You see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us.
Sheldon, how about this as my motivation-- when I was 14 years old, I was abused in the Philippines by a clubfooted navy chaplain.
No.
We're going with middle child and a genetic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.
Swell.
How do I play genetic predisposition?
Subtextually, of course.
Just have fun with it.
Morning, Penny.
How did the intervention go?
Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.
Well, based on what you told me, I am not surprised.
But we did convince him to leave the motel.
Come say hello.
Leo.
This is Penny, our friend and neighbor.
Hi, Leo.
How are you feeling?
Let me ask you something, Penny.
Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?
No.
Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.
Well, that's Leo.
Why don't you tell me about your showcase last night.
It was okay,I guess.
It wasn't a big turnout, but they both really seemed to like it.
There were only two people there?
By the end, yeah.
Damn you, chaplain harrigan!
I'm I'm sorry?
The Philippines.
The subic bay naval station.
A young boy on the cusp of manhood.
His only companions, mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes.
Desperate and alone, he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving god, but who instead introduced him to a gin-pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat.
What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away?
Don't forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
That's never been proven.
There have been studies.
Not double-blind studies.
How could there be a double-blind study?
Who would be the control group?
As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly.
Let's give them some privacy.
Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?
Oh, sounds good.
I have a video of me singing last night.
Do you want to see it?
Gee, why wouldn't I?
This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.
Yeah.
Funny how things work out.
But he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.
Your parents made the right decision.
I cannot work like this.
This is amazing.
Just sitting on a couch watching tv with a woman.
Not being drunk or, or high or wondering if you're a dude down there.
Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy.
You're gonna to do okay.
One day at a time, Penny.
One day at a time.
How long is he going to stay here?
He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard.
Where is he going to go?
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
Proudly Presents
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Checkmate.
- Again?
- Obviously, you're not well suited for three-dimensional chess.
Perhaps three-dimensional Candy Land would be more your speed.
Just reset the board.
It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.
Hey, guys.
- Did you get my mail?
- Yeah, right here.
- How was Nebraska?
- Well, better than North Dakota.
I guess that joke's only funny in Nebraska.
From the data at hand, you really can't draw that conclusion.
All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.
Boy, it's good to be back.
- How's your family?
- It was the worst trip.
Everyone got sick over the weekend.
- Sick?
- Here we go.
What kind of sick?
The flu, I guess.
I don't need you to guess.
I need you to know.
Now, when did the symptoms first appear?
Maybe Friday.
Friday.
Was that morning or afternoon?
I- I don't Think, woman.
Who blew their nose and when?
Sheldon, relax.
She doesn't have any symptoms.
I'm sure she's not contagious.
Oh, please.
If influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear, it would have died out thousands of years ago.
Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilis would have figured out how to kill the guy with the runny nose.
Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon.
He's a bit of a germaphobe.
It's okay.
I understand.
Thanks for your consideration.
Now please leave.
You'd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.
Okay.
Well, thank you for getting my mail.
No problem.
Welcome home.
What?
!
Episode 111 : The Pancake Batter Anomaly What the hell are you doing?
I'm making petri dishes to grow throat cultures.
With lime Jell-O?
I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yogurt.
Here, swab my throat.
I don't think so.
If I'm going to get ahead of this thing, I need to find out what's growing in my throat.
Sheldon, you are not sick.
This is, but you are not.
We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid she has introduced into our environment.
For having never been to Nebraska, I'm fairly certain that I have no corn-husking antibodies.
Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?
When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these Jell-O cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.
- I'm going back to bed.
- Wait.
- Put this in the bathroom.
- What for?
I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.
I mixed pancake batter in this!
No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.
You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment including the label maker, but you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said "urine cup"?
It's right here on the bottom.
I guess I owe the Betty Crocker Company a letter of apology.
Oh, dear God.
Leonard, I'm sick!
Leonard, I'm sick!
Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over.
- Hey!
- Leonard, where are you?
I'm at work.
At 6:30 in the morning?
On Sunday?
- Why?
- They asked me to come in.
I didn't hear the phone ring.
They texted me.
Well, as I predicted, I am sick.
My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2:00 a.m., and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.
No kidding?
No, not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green.
All right, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.
What else would I drink, gases, solids, ionized plasma?
Drink whatever you want.
- I want soup.
- Then make soup.
We don't have soup.
I'm at work, Sheldon.
Is that a dog?
In the lab?
They're training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists.
I have to go.
Howard, it's the phone!
I know it's the phone, Ma, I hear the phone!
Well, who's calling at this ungodly hour?
!
I don't know!
Well, ask them why they're calling at this ungodly hour!
How can I ask them when I'm talking to you?
!
Hello.
It's Leonard.
Code milky green.
Dear Lord, not milky green.
Affirmative.
With fever.
Who's on the phone?
!
It's Leonard!
Why is he calling?
!
Sheldon's sick!
Were you playing with him?
!
For God's sake, Ma, I'm 26 years old!
Excuse me, Mr. Grownup!
What do you want for breakfast?
!
Chocolate milk and Eggos, please!
- Listen to me.
- Hang on.
Call waiting.
No, don't!
Hello.
Howard, I'm sick.
Howard's sleeping.
This is his mother!
Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?
I need soup.
Then call your own mother!
It was Sheldon.
- I tried to stop you.
- It's my own fault.
I forgot the protocol we put in place after The Great Ear Infection of '06.
Call Koothrappali.
We need to find a place to lay low for the next 18 to 24 hours.
Stand by.
Ma, can my friends come over?
I just had the carpet steamed!
That's a negatory.
But there's a Planet of The Apes marathon at the NuArt today.
Five movies, two hours apiece..
it's a start.
Homeless, crazy guy at table 18.
No, just crazy.
Sheldon, what are you doing here?
I'm sick.
Thank you very much.
How could you have gotten if from me?
I'm not sick.
You're a carrier.
All these people here are doomed.
You're doomed!
Sheldon, what do you want?
I want soup.
Why didn't you?
Why didn't you just have soup at home?
Penny, I have an IQ of 187.
Don't you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home, I would have thought of it?
You can have soup delivered.
I did not think of that.
Clearly, febrile delirium is setting in.
Please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.
What kind of soup do you want?
Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these homemade croutons.
We have chicken, tortilla and potato leek.
Could I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and homemade croutons?
Then surprise me.
Would you call that "moss green" or "forest green"?
Look at this.
Everyone went chimp.
I'd like to point out that I voted for orangutan, but you shouted me down.
- Hi, Penny.
- Hey, where are you?
I'm at work.
You sound funny.
Look.
I'm I'm in a radiation suit.
- What's up?
- I'm at work, too, and you'll never guess who's here infecting my entire station.
Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory.
- Just tell him to go home.
- He won't leave.
He's afraid he'll pass out on the bus, and someone will harvest his organs.
He's paranoid, and he's established a nest.
Can you please come get him?
Yeah, I'd be happy to.
Oh, my God, there's a breach in the radiation unit!
The whole city is in jeopardy!
Oh, my God!
The containment vessel's melting.
Gotta go.
Bye!
I feel really guilty.
You did what you had to do.
Take your stinking paws off my popcorn, you damn dirty ape!
Thanks for bringing me home.
It's okay.
I didn't really need to work today.
It's not like I have rent or car payments or anything.
Good, good.
Okay, well, you feel better.
Wait!
Where are you going?
Home to write some bad checks.
You're going to leave me?
Sheldon, you are a grown man.
Haven't you ever been sick before?
Of course, but not by myself.
Really?
Never?
Well, once, when I was 15, spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.
Studying abroad?
No.
Visiting professor.
Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to, and the result was an internal Blitzkrieg, with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.
And there was no one there to take care of you?
My Mom had to fly back to Texas to help my Dad, because the house had slipped off the cinder blocks again.
- Again?
- It was tornado season.
And it was an aluminum house.
The housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English.
When I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said, "MÃ chtest du eine DarmspÃ¼lung"?
What does that mean?
Based on what happened next, I assume it means, "Would you like an enema"?
Okay, sweetie.
I'll take care of you.
What do you need?
My Mom used to give me sponge baths.
Okay, ground rules: no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.
Agreed.
Here we go.
Ten-and-a-half hours of ape-y goodness.
Damn it, my glasses.
Okay, I'm blind here, guys.
Can you help me find them?
- Sorry.
- Okay.
Found them.
Oh, great.
I'm sorry.
Don't you have a spare?
Yeah, at home.
If you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.
Unless Sheldon's there, in which case, you'll be trapped forever in his whiny, hyper-neurotic snot web.
Hi.
Penny?
I was just wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant?
Okay, that was very nice of you.
Okay, I gotta go.
Got kind of a full-blown Chernobyl thing here.
Gotta go, bye.
He's home.
I'm screwed.
Ten-and-a-half hours of ape-y blurriness.
How about Lasik?
You want me to get eye surgery?
Would you rather go home and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?
- Well?
- I'm thinking.
Okay, nice and cozy.
Okay?
I'll see you later.
Wait.
Will you please rub this on my chest?
Sheldon, can't you do that yourself?
VapoRub makes my hands smell funny.
- But, Sheldon - Please, please, please?
I can't believe I'm doing this.
No, no.
Counterclockwise, or my chest hair mats.
Sorry.
Can you sing "Soft Kitty"?
What?
My Mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.
- Oh, sorry, honey.
I don't know it.
- I'll teach you.
Soft kitty, warm kitty, Little ball of fur Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr Now you.
Soft kitty, Warm kitty Little ball of fur Keep rubbing.
Little ball of fur What do you see?
I can't.
The living room appears to be empty.
He must be in his bedroom.
My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my bat signal.
I'm not going in there.
- Raj?
- No way, Jose.
But I can't do it.
I can't see anything.
It's all right.
Wireless minicam and Bluetooth headset.
We'll be your eyes.
Fine.
One more thing.
This is a subsonic impact sensor.
If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop.
At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you'll have 7 seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.
Won't my footsteps set it off?
No.
You'll be on your hands and knees.
You'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon's room.
How do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees?
Stay low.
Bear left.
- Now keep true.
- What?
- It means "go straight".
- Then just say, "Go straight".
You don't say, "Go straight".
When you're giving bearings, you say, "Keep true".
All right.
I just hit my head.
Because you didn't keep true.
Okay, turn right.
The picture's breaking up.
Angle your head to the right.
Now, a little more.
Little more.
That's it.
Now, just keep true.
You're close enough to Sheldon's room.
Deploy the sensor.
Now, turn it on.
It wasn't on?
Then why did I have to crawl?
No, I guess you didn't.
Okay, it's on.
Good.
From this point forward, you will have to crawl.
I know.
Hang on, the sensor's picking up something.
Turn your head back.
You rat bastard.
Told you the sensor would work.
You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.
Come on, I had to.
You see what he's like?
Penny, I'm hungry.
It's okay, sweetie.
Good news!
Leonard's home!
Here you go.
Good luck.
Bye.
Leonard!
I'm hungry!
Penny, take me with you!
I want grilled cheese.
Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?
I don't think Penny's ever coming here again.
I'm very congested.
Yeah?
So?
Could you go to the kitchen and get me the turkey baster labeled "mucous"?
If I stand, I'll vomit.
Under the sink, yellow Tupper Ware bowl.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Here's the problem with teleportation.
Lay it on me.
Assuming a device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual.
You would have destroyed him in one location and recreated him in another.
How about that.
Personally, I would never use a transporter, because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.
Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?
No, he would be exactly the same.
That is a problem.
So you see it too.
Dr. Hofstadter.
Dr. Cooper.
Dr. Gablehauser.
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim.
Dennis is a highly sought-after doctoral candidate, and we're hoping he'll do his graduate work here.
- Graduate work.
Very impressive.
- And he's only 15 years old.
Not bad I, myself, started graduate school at 14.
Well, I lost a year while my family was tunneling out of North Korea.
Advantage: Kim.
I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around.
Let him see why we're the best physics research facility in the country.
I already know you're not.
You don't have an Open Science Grid computer or a free electron laser.
And the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.
Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.
Well, obviously you don't see it yet, but trust me, you will.
Dennis, we've discussed this.
We're in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals.
We've agreed to look the other way if you use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang.
We want him here, boys.
- Make it happen.
- Yes, sir.
You can count on us.
We're on it.
What the hell do you mean, "dead end"?
I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as 10 to the 500th power.
In addition Look, chocolate milk.
I sense a disturbance in the Force.
A bad feeling I have about this.
Episode 112 The Jerusalem Duality So, Dennis, how long have you been in America?
- A year and a half.
- No kidding.
- You speak English really well.
- So do you.
Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.
What are you talking about?
That.
He's not wrong.
All right And this is my office.
- Is this part of the tour?
- Nope.
Goodbye.
Come on, Sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.
All right.
This is my desk.
These are my books; this is my door.
Please close it behind you.
Goodbye.
Looks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections.
Keen observation.
Goodbye.
You see where you went wrong, don't you?
Leonard, get him out.
Come on.
I'll show you the rec center.
They've got Nautilus equipment.
Do I look like I lift weights?
Not heavy ones.
It's startling you haven't considered a Lorentz invariant or field theory approach.
You think I haven't considered it?
You really think I haven't considered it?
Have you considered it?
- Get him out, Leonard.
- Come on, Dennis.
I'll show you the radiation lab.
Wow, you won the Stevenson Award?
Yes.
In fact, I am the youngest person ever to win it.
Really?
How old?
Fourteen and a half.
You were the youngest person ever to win it.
It's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn't it?
This is really delicious, isn't it?
Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh?
Sweetie, you are so damaged.
Hey, I'm damaged, too.
How about a hug for Howie?
Sure.
Raj, hug Howard.
Something you'd like to share?
A tale of woe, perhaps?
Dennis Kim is 15 years old, and he's already correcting my work.
Today, I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, to - You know, that other guy.
- Antonio Salieri?
Oh God, now even you are smarter than me.
You know, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.
Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.
Why waste food?
In Texas, when a cow goes dry, they don't keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.
I'm confused.
Did Sheldon stop giving milk?
You can't let this kid get to you.
You always knew that someday someone younger and smarter would come along.
Yes, but I assumed I would've been dead hundreds of years and that there'd be an asterisk by his name because he'd be a cyborg.
So you've got a little competition.
I really don't see what the big deal is.
Of course you don't.
You've never excelled at anything.
I don't understand exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?
We liked Leonard.
What are you gonna do, Sheldon, just give up?
It's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a postpubescent Asian wunderkind.
He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.
I'm confused again.
Is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?
I've decided you're right.
My career is not over.
Great!
Since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.
Great!
So I've decided.
I'm going to collaborate with you.
Great.
So what exactly is it you do?
You chatter on about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention.
Right now, I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at see level, - but I really don't need any help.
- Sure you do.
See, what's this here in the schematic?
Is that a laser array?
- Yes.
- Now What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium-neon?
- It would blow up.
- Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
"Pretty sure" is not very scientific.
Is this how you normally work?
Just hunches and guesses and stuff?
I understand that you're going through a bit of a career cris, you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive, but I need to tell you something.
I want you to listen carefully.
- All right.
- Go away.
If you're concerned about sharing credit with me, your name can go first I'm going.
It's a small, brown paper bag, Ma!
I'm looking in it right now.
Why would I make that up?
There's no Ding Dong in it.
How are two Ding Dongs tomorrow gonna help me today?
So This is Engineering, huh?
I'll talk to you later.
Engineering.
Where the noble semiskilled laborers execute the vision of those who think and dream.
Hello, Oompa-Loompas of science.
Sheldon, what are you doing here?
I just came by to say hello.
I've been in this lab for 3 years.
You've never come by to say hello.
Up until now, I've had better things to do.
So, what are we making today?
A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package - that's going up on a space shuttle.
- Really?
How does it work?
When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.
So, it's a shelf.
No, you don't understand.
During acceleration, it needs to stay perfectly level and provide Yeah, it's a shelf.
I notice you're using titanium.
Did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes?
They're lighter, cheaper, and have twice the tensile strength.
There's a diploma in my office that says I have a master's in engineering.
You also have a note from your mother that says, "I love you, Bubula".
But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes.
Go away!
Did Leonard tell you to say that?
No, I thought of it all by myself.
That can't be a coincidence.
There must be some causal link I'm missing.
Go away!
Curiouser and curiouser.
- Is he here?
- If he were, I wouldn't be.
Do you know what he did?
He watched me work for 10 min, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me.
Is that even possible?
As it turns out, yes.
Something's got to be done about him.
Like what?
He'll never be able to cope with the fact that some 15-year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.
What if something happened to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?
Then our problem would be solved.
Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim?
I'm not saying no.
We don't have to go that far.
There are other means available.
We can't send him back to North Korea.
He knows how to get out.
The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.
Won't happen.
He is not interested in anything but physics.
- What about biology?
- What?
You know, biology.
The one thing that can completely derail a world-class mind.
He's 15.
Yeah, so?
When I was 15, I met Denise Palmeri and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.
She was sleeping with you?
No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did.
Oh, good, you're all here.
Look, if the three of you drop whatever it is you're working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade.
12 years, tops.
Go away?
Could it be me?
What's up?
We need a hot 15-year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.
What?
Howard, that's racist.
Any 15-year-old girl will do the trick.
It's possible she may have misunderstood us.
Dr. Cooper.
Are we interrupting?
No, please come in.
I think you'll appreciate this.
This is very exciting.
- What are you working on?
- Something remarkable.
Since my prospects for the Nobel prize in physics have disappeared thank you very much, I've decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel peace prize.
I will solve the Middle East crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.
To what end?
It's like the baseball movie.
"Build it and they will come".
Who will come?
The Jewish people.
- What if they don't come?
- We'll make it nice, put out a spread.
Okay, well, speaking of spreads, we're having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr. Kim who's agreed to join us here at the university.
Of course he has.
The Oracle told us little Neo was the one.
You can see the matrix, can't you?
Well, obviously you're very busy with your Come, Dennis.
You'll have to excuse Dr. Cooper.
He's been under a lot of He's nuts.
They'll come, they'll settle, and I'll win the prize.
I really don't understand your objections, professor Goldfarb.
Why wouldn't the Sonora desert make a perfectly good promised land?
Go away.
We could call it Nuevo Jerusalem.
Please go away.
Said Pharaoh to Moses.
Why are all these young women here?
It's Take Your Daughter To Work Day.
Really?
I was not aware of that.
Yes.
There was a very official e-mail sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.
- Smooth.
- Thank you.
There's the man of the hour.
Okay, so we now have a socially-awkward genius in a room full of attractive, age-appropriate women.
All he has to do now is hook up with one of them.
Anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
- We need a social catalyst.
- Like what?
We can't get 15-year-old girls drunk.
- Or can we?
- No, we can't.
I don't think you mean "we can't".
I think you mean "we shouldn't".
You're a Jew.
If there was another Wailing Wall exactly like the one in Jerusalem but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it?
Okay, it's definitely me.
We cannot leave this to chance.
Let's pick a girl and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.
How about that one?
I know the type.
Cheerleader, student council, goes out with the jocks, won't even look at anybody in the gifted program.
If after 2 years of begging, she agrees to go out with you, it turns out to be a setup and you're in your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at y - Are you crying?
- No, I have allergies.
Okay How about her?
Sure, if he wants to spend two years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with nonfat White Russians.
You're holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes "more guys were like you".
Then she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you.
Okay, so not her, either.
How about her?
Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby, so probably low self-esteem.
I think that's our girl.
One of us should go talk to her.
I can't talk to her you do it.
I can't just go up and talk to her.
Howard, you talk to her.
She'll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this.
In India, this would be simpler.
and a laptop, and we'd be done.
- We're not in India.
- Why don't we do it your way then?
We'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.
- Okay, that was uncalled for.
- You started it, dude.
Could I have everyone's attention, please?
What a wonderful occasion this is, and how fortunate that it should happen to fall on Take Your Daughter to Work Day.
We're here to welcome Mr. Dennis Kim to our little family.
Welcome, Dennis Kim.
Mr. Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stanford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stevenson Award.
Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!
And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr. Dennis Kim.
What?
!
Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research?
No, thanks.
I'm going to the mall with Emma.
The kid got a girl.
Unbelievable.
Did anyone see how he did it?
Don't worry, I've got this.
Ladies and gentlemen, honored daughters, while Mr. Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivete, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me.
Thank you.
- He's back.
- Mission accomplished.
Forget the mission.
How did that little yutz get a girl on his own?
I guess times have changed since we were young.
Smart is the new sexy.
Then why do we go home alone every night?
We're still smart.
Maybe we're too smart.
So smart it's off-putting.
Yeah, let's go with that.
Unbelievable.
Components I built are on the International Space Station and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park.
I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman, "You have to frisk me.
I have another rocket in my pants".
Look at that.
It's Dennis Kim.
I almost didn't recognize him.
I kind of feel bad about what we did to him.
Yeah, we really ruined his life.
Screw him He was weak.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
More details about the new Star Trek film.
There's going to be a scene depicting Spock's birth.
I'd be more interested in a scene depicting Spock's conception.
Oh, please.
For Vulcans, mating or if you will, PonFahr - it's an extremely private matter.
- Still, I'd like to know the details.
His mother was human.
His father is Vulcan.
- They couldn't just conceive.
- Maybe they had to go to a clinic.
Can you imagine Spock's Dad in a little room with a copy of Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears.
How come on Star Trek everybody's private parts are the same?
No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, "Hey, get your thing out of my nose".
Hi.
Can you help me?
I was writing an e-mail and the "A" key got stuck.
Now it's just going "Aaa" - What'd you spill on it?
- Nothing.
Diet Coke.
And yogurt.
And a little nail polish.
I'll take a look at it.
Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news Fishman, Chen, Chaudury and McNair aren't fielding a team in the university Physics Bowl this year.
You're kidding.
Why not?
They formed a barbershop quartet and got a gig playing Knott's Berry Farm.
So, in your world, you're like the cool guys.
Recognize.
This is our year.
With those guys out, the entire Physics Bowl will kneel before Zod.
Zod?
Kryptonian villain.
Long story.
Good story.
- Count me out.
- What?
Why?
You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition?
Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary?
Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle?
Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?
Come on, you need a four-person team.
We're four people.
By that reasoning we should also play Bridge, hold up a chuppah Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock's dying words to you?
No, don't.
"The needs of the many " outweigh the needs of the few.
"Or the one".
Damn it, I'll do it.
Episode 1x13 The Bat Jar Conjecture The Bat Jar Conjecture First order of Physics Bowl business.
We need a truly kick-ass team name.
Suggestions?
How about the Perpetual Motion Squad?
It's beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads-up for the ladies.
The ladies?
"Perpetual Motion Squad we can go all night".
- I like it.
- I don't.
Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating one's opponent.
- Then we could be the Bengal tigers.
- Poor choice.
Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant.
Maybe so, but you can't incinerate a Bengal tiger with a magnifying glass.
Let's put it to a vote.
All those in favor Point of order.
I move that any vote on team names must be unanimous.
No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with a Bengal tiger when common sense dictates it should be an army ant.
Will the gentleman from the great State of Denial yield for a question?
I will yield.
After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit - if he does not get his way?
- He does.
I move we are the Army Ants.
All those in favor?
Good afternoon, and welcome to today's Physics Bowl practice round.
I'm Penny, and I'll be your host because apparently I didn't have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn't that just a little sad?
Gentlemen, ready?
- Yes.
- Fire away.
It's none of my business, but isn't a guy who can't speak in front of women gonna hold you back a little?
He'll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd.
He only has a problem when they're one-on-one and smell nice.
Thanks, Raj.
It's vanilla oil.
I was actually the one who noticed.
Okay, let's just start.
Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics.
"What is the shortest light pulse ever produced"?
- Dr. Cooper.
- And of course, the answer is 130 attoseconds.
- That is correct.
- I knew that, too.
Good for you, sweetie.
Okay, next question: "What is the quantum mechanical effect "used to encode data on hard-disk drives"?
And of course the answer is giant magnetoresistance.
- Right.
- Hey, I buzzed in.
And I answered.
It's called teamwork.
Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions?
I am an engineer.
By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal.
Just ask another one.
"What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einstein's predicted frame dragging"?
And of course, it's Gravity Probe B. Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.
Why?
Because it's polite.
What do manners have to do with it?
This is war.
Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.
The objective of the competion is to give correct answers.
If I know them, why shouldn't I give them?
Some of us might have the correct answers, too.
Oh, please.
You don't even have a PhD.
- All right, that's it!
- Howard, sit down.
- Maybe we should take a little break.
- Good idea.
I need my wrist brace.
All this button-pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.
I agree.
What did he say?
He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer's eve.
Yeah, and the bag it came in.
Leonard, excellent.
I want to show you something.
Can it wait?
I need to talk to you.
Just look.
I've designed the perfect uniforms for our team.
The colors are based on Star Trek: The Original Series.
The three of you will wear Support Red, and I will wear Command Gold.
Why do they say "AA"?
Army Ants.
Isn't that confusing?
"AA" might mean something else to certain people.
Why would a Physics Bowl team be called Anodized Aluminum?
No, I meant Never mind.
Check it out, I got you a Batman cookie jar.
Oh, neat!
What's the occasion?
Well, you're a friend, and you like Batman and cookies, and you're off the team.
What?
Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, we did.
I just came from there.
Okay, I don't know where you just came from, but it could'nt have been a team meeting because I wasn't there.
Ergo, the team did not meet.
Okay, let me try it this way: I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends, and one thing led to another, and it turns out you're off the team.
Why?
Because you're taking all the fun out of it.
I'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics Bowl the team that has the most fun?
Okay, let me try it this way: You're annoying and no one wants to play with you anymore.
I see.
At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.
Thanks for the heads-up.
You're welcome.
- One more thing.
- Yes?
It's on, bitch.
- So who'd he get to be on his team?
- He won't say.
He just smiles and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.
He's using psychological warfare.
We must reply in kind.
I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, "Yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, "but we are also smart and strong, and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you".
How exactly would that laugh go?
That sounds more like, "We are a tall, thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians".
Let's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my roommate.
So?
So nothing.
Let's destroy him.
Gentlemen.
We're going to need a strong fourth for our team.
You know who is apparently very smart is the girl who played TV's Blossom.
She got a PhD.
in neuroscience or something.
Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom to join our Physics Bowl team.
How about the girl from The Wonder Years?
Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution to all our problems.
We can't ask Leslie Winkle.
Why?
Because you slept together, and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night's chutney?
Yes.
Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.
Sack up, dude.
Fine.
Here I go, taking one for the team in the sack.
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hi, guys.
So, Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I Hit that thing.
Leonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we've seen each other's faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus.
There's not?
Gee, 'cause it sure sounds like there should be.
Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.
That's all very comforting, but if it's okay, I'd like to get on to my question now.
Proceed.
We are entering the Physics Bowl, and we need a fourth for our team.
No, thanks.
I'm really busy with my like-sign dilepton supersymmetry search.
Dilepton, shmylepton.
We need you.
Sorry.
Well, we tried.
We'll just have to face Sheldonmano y mano y mano a mano.
Wait, you're going up against Sheldon Cooper?
That arrogant, misogynistic, East Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high-energy particles for laundry and childbearing?
She's in.
So, how do you feel?
Nice and loose?
Come to play?
Got your game face on?
Are you ready?
Yeah.
You know, you don't have to stay for the whole thing.
Oh, no.
I want to.
Sounds really interesting.
Gentlemen.
I'm just gonna sit down.
So, is that your team?
Actually, I don't need a team.
I could easily defeat you single-handedly, but the rules require four.
So, may I introduce the third-floor janitor, the lady from the lunch room, and my Spanish is not good either her son or her butcher.
And what about your team?
What rat have you recruited to the S.S. Sinking Ship?
Hello, Sheldon.
Leslie Winkle.
Yeah, Leslie Winkle.
The answer to the question, "Who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl"?
Well, I'm polymerized tree sap, and you're an inorganic adhesive.
So whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory and adheres to you.
Oh, ouch!
Okay, if everyone could please take your seats.
Here's your T-shirt.
PMS?
It's a couple days early It stands for "Perpetual Motion Squad".
Of course.
What was I thinking?
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl!
Today's preliminary match features two great teams.
AA versus PMS.
All night long, y'all!
Okay, well, let's jump right in.
First question for ten points: "What is the iso-spin singlet partner "of the pi-zero meson"?
PMS?
- The eta meson.
- Correct.
- Formal protest.
- On what grounds?
The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
Denied.
All right, for ten points, "What is the lightest element on Earth "with no stable isotope"?
AA?
And of course, the answer is technetium.
Terrific.
Next question: "What is the force between two uncharged plates "due to quantum vacuum fluctuations"?
PMS?
Sheldon can suck on the Casimir effect.
Correct.
How does a quantum computer factor large numbers?
PMS?
- Shor's algorithm.
- Correct!
to the seventh ergs per calorie.
Prevost's theory of exchanges.
Lambda equals one over pi r squared n. the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row.
Mr. Wolowitz, this is your second warning.
A sigma particle.
Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the Earth.
Correct!
Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question.
The score now stands.
1,150,  1,175.
So, for 100 points and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens.
Solve the equation.
Holy crap.
What the hell is that?
Looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell.
Come on.
Think.
Leslie?
It's not gonna work if you rush me.
You have to let me get there.
You are never gonna let that go, are you?
Ten seconds.
PMS?
Sorry, I panicked.
Then guess.
Eight.
.
4 I'm sorry, that's incorrect.
AA, if you can answer correctly, the match is yours.
He doesn't have it.
He's got squat.
AA, I need your answer.
The answer is minus eight pi alpha.
Hang on a second.
That's not our answer.
- What are you doing?
- Answering question.
Winning Physics Bowl.
How do you know anything about physics?
Here I am janitor.
In former Soviet Union, I am physicist.
Leningrad Politechnika.
Go Polar Bears.
That's a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything - I answer the questions.
- You didn't answer question.
Look, now, maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this Physics Bowl team, I rule with an iron fist.
AA, I need your official answer.
- It's not what he said.
- Then what is it?
- I want a different question.
- You can't.
- Formal protest.
- Denied.
Informal protest.
Denied.
- I need your official answer.
- No.
I decline to provide one.
That's too bad because the answer your teammate gave was correct.
That's your opinion.
- The winner of the match is - Hang on.
Is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team?
I don't understand the question.
- Go ahead.
- The winner is PMS.
Sorry, somebody's sitting there.
Who?
My Physics Bowl trophy.
That trophy is meaningless.
I forfeited, therefore you did not win.
- I know someone who would disagree.
- Who?
My Physics Bowl trophy.
Leonard is so smart.
- Sheldon who?
- All right, that is very immature.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I'm not!
- Okay, new contest.
- What are you doing?
I am settling once and for all who is the smartest around here, okay?
- Ready?
- Absolutely.
Bring it on.
"Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters "in what TV family"?
The Brady Bunch.
"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group"?
The Brady Bunch?
Van Halen.
"Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum".
Oh, my God!
Sean Penn!
How do you know these things?
I go outside, and I talk to people.
Okay, here.
"What actor holds the record "for being named People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive"?
- William Shatner.
- Wait.
I don't think it's Shatner.
Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart.
Formal protest.
"Singer who sang, Oops, I Did It Again"?
"Tweetie Bird taut he taw a what"?
Romulan.
Yes.
He taut he taw a Romulan.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
This sandwich is an unmitigated disaster.
I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on whole wheat.
What did they give you?
Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.
It's the right ingredients but in the wrong order.
In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce.
They might as well drag this thing into a car wash.
I don't believe it.
I know, it's basic culinary science.
Some guy is actioning up a miniature time machine prop from the original film and nobody's bidding on it.
A time machine from the movie "The time machine"?
No, a time machine from "Sophie's choice".
Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie Did you see it?
It's rough.
Oh that's cool.
It's only 800 dollars?
Yes, and that's my bid.
You bid 800 dollars?
Yes, it was a spur-of-the-moment thing I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it.
There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.
Do you have 800 dollars?
Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
Oh don't worry, the way this thing works is people waiting till the last seconds to bid and then they swoop in and get it.
It's called sniping.
Come on snipers.
Ten, nine, eight Where are your snipers?
- Five - Snipe!
- Four - Snipe!
- Three - Snipe!
- Two - Snipe!
One Congratulations!
You are a proud owner of a miniature time machine.
You lucky duck.
I wonder why no one else bid This is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia.
I know!
I still can't afford it.
Why don't we share it?
Well each put 200 bucks and we'll take turns having it in our house.
A time shared time machine.
I'm in.
Sheldon?
Need you ask?
But I still don't understand why no one else bid.
I understand why no one else bid.
Our whole universe was in a hot,dense state then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History Unraveling the mystery That all started With a Big Bang!
Bang!
The Big Bang Theory S01 E14 The Nerdmabelia Scattering The Big Bang Theory S01 E14 The Nerdmabelia Scattering Did the listing actually said "miniature"?
I just assumed.
Who sells a full size time machine for 800 dollars?
In a Venn diagram that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets: "No longer want my time machine" and "Need 800 dollars".
It's actually a tremendous bargain.
Even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound.
Cocktails shrimp at 12.50.
How are we gonna get it upstairs?
If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator.
Yes but the elevator has been broken for two years.
I've been meaning to ask you Do you think we should make a call about that?
Not necessarily.
I have a masters in engineering.
I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis.
I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads.
When the Mars Rover started pulling to the left, I performed a front end alignment from No, that baby's broken.
Come on guys, push!
If I push any harder I'm gonna give birth to my colon.
I can't feel my fingers!
Hurry up!
It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go.
Basic physics.
- Sheldon?
- Yeah?
If my fingers ever work again I've got a job for the middle one.
Oh hey guys.
Hi Penny.
Take a break guys.
What are you doing?
We're just, you know, moving something upstairs.
What is it?
Just, you know, a time machine.
Yeah, ok, neat, but I really gotta get to work, so - Just give us a few minutes.
- I don't have a few minutes.
I'm running really late.
I have a sample solution.
Go up to the roof, hop over the next building There's a small gap - don't look down if you suffer the vertigo - and use their stairway.
You're joking, right?
I never joke when it comes to vertigo.
Damn Ok, I'll just take the roof.
Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine I can drop you off to work yesterday.
Time travel jokes.
Nevermind.
For what it's worth, I thought it was humorous.
Let's just do this.
Guys, ready to push?
In a minute.
Howard stepped outside to throw up.
I don't know what you're worried about.
I think it really works in the room.
Yeah.
It is by far the coolest thing I've ever owned.
The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from victorian England into the post-apocaliptic future where society had splintered into two factions: The subterranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface-dwelling Eloi.
Talk about you chick magnet.
Oh, yeah.
The guy who lives next to me is always like "I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony" "I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony" Wait until I tell him "I've got a time machine on my balcony" Stuff that in your Speedoes, Jacuzzi Bob".
Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns but I think you'll agree that practicality dictates it remain here.
You can't just keep it here What if I meet a girl and say "Do you wanna come up and see my time machine?
It's at my friend's house" How lame is that?
- He's got a point.
- All right.
I think we're going to need some ground rules, in addiction to the expected "No shoes in the time machine" and "No eating in the time machine" I propose that we add "Pants must be worn at all times in the time machine" Second it.
I was gonna put down a towel.
I still want it on my balcony.
I say we move it on a bimonthly basis.
- Yeah, that sounds fair - Hold on.
"bimonthly" is an ambiguous term.
Do you mean moving it every other month or twice a month?
- Twice a month.
- Then no.
Ok, every other month.
No.
Sheldon, you can't be selfish.
We all paid for it so it belongs to all of us.
Now get out of the way so I can sit on my time machine.
Ok.
I'm setting the dials for 10th March 1876.
Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr. Watson.
Wait a minute, I want to see that too.
So when it's your turn you can.
But if you all go back to the same point and time Bell's lab is going to get very crowded.
He'll know something's up.
Also, since the time machine doesn't move in space you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.
And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you gonna do?
Knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell Hey, Mrs Bell, I'm a big fan of your husband Can I come in and watch him inventing the telephone?
Mrs Bell was deaf She's not even going to hear you knock.
I have a solution.
First, go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.
How far into the future?
If I remember correctly Captain Kirk would steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Star Date 5027.3 Which would be 10th January 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.
Ok, I'm setting the dials for 10th January 2328.
Here we go into the future.
That was fun.
My turn!
Ok, first of all what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide - I slipped and skinned my knee.
- Are you ok?
Second of all, the door to the stairway of the other building was locked.
so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor forcing me to crawl to the window of a lovely Armenian family who insisted I'd stay for lunch.
That doesn't sound too bad.
It was eight courses of lamb.
And they tried to fix me up with their son.
- Sorry.
- Not done.
By the time I finally got to work they'd given my shift away.
Yeah, that's right I've lost an entire day's pay thanks to this.
- this - time machine The lights flash, the dish spins, do you wanna try it?
No!
!
I don't wanna try it My God, you are grown men.
How can you waste your lives with these stupid toys, and costumes and comic books and and now that!
- That - Again, time machine.
Oh please, it's not time machine If anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.
It only moves in time.
It would be worse than useless in a swamp.
Pathethic!
all of you!
Completely pathethic My turn Leonard, it's 2:00 in the morning So?
So it's my turn.
Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
Because I wanna go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
You can't.
If you would prevent yourself from buying it in the past you wouldn't have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it.
Ergo, you'd still have it.
This is a classic working time-travel mistake.
Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
Same paradox If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious you would not then have the conversation that irritated you motivating you to knock me unconscious.
What if I knock you unconscious right now?
It won't change the past.
But it'd make the present so much nicer.
Are you upset about something?
What was your first clue?
Well, that was a number of things.
First, the late hour.
Then your demeanor seems very low energy - Plus your irritability - Yes, I'm upset!
I don't usually pick up on those things.
Good for me.
Yes, good for you.
Oh, wait.
Did you wanna talk about what's bothering you?
I don't know, maybe.
Wow, I'm on fire tonight.
Here's the thing.
Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.
I disagree.
Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine.
That failure clearly stands on itself.
Thanks for pointing it out.
In addiction, your premise is flaw.
In the original film Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux in that very time machine.
in "Back to the future" Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.
Those are movies.
Of course they are movies.
Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real-life time machine?
It's absurd.
Come on, guys, push!
If I push any harder I'm gonna give birth to my colon.
Hi guys.
Hi Penny.
Take a break guys!
What are you doing?
Oh, you know just moving a time machine.
Yeah, ok, neat, but I really gotta get to work, so No problem Hang on.
But, what about your time machine?
Something more important than the toys I'm scared Don't worry baby.
I've got you.
It's still my turn.
What are you doing?
I'm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down at the comic books store to sell.
Was that really necessary?
If you need money you can always sell blood.
and semen.
Not about money We brought food!
Lox and bagels, the breakfast for time travellers.
Terrific Does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?
Why?
I don't want it anymore.
Why?
justpersonal reason My spidy sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.
Look, - Do you want to buy me out or not?
- I'll give you make me half owner and we'll put it on my balcony.
Screw his balcony I'll give you 120 and we'll put it in my garage.
I paid 200 dollars for my share.
Dude, everybody knows a time machine loses half his value the minute you drive him off the lot.
I go for 200 and that time machine stands right where it is.
original 1979 Mattel Millennium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.
No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader's voice changers.
I'm getting rid of all of it You can't do that.
Look at what you've created here.
It's like "Nerdvana".
More importantly, you have a Darth Vader's voice changer?
Not for long.
Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.
Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.
Too bad, I called dibs.
- You can't just call dibs.
- I can and I did Look at "dibs" on the Wikipedia.
Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.
It's not a bidding war.
I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic books store.
Why Larry?
Did Larry call dibs?
Would you forget dibs?
He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
What's the number?
I'll match it.
I'll match it plus 1000 rupies - What's the exchange rate?
- None of your business.
Take it or leave it.
Mom, my Bar Mitzvah bond how much have I got?
Thanks.
I can go 2.600 dollars and two trees in Israel.
Forget it.
If I sell it to one of you the other two are gonna be really mad at me.
Who cares?
As long as you pick me!
Okay Leonard, put down that box.
- Let's talk.
- Sorry Raj.
My mind is made up No I can't let you do this Sheldon, get out of my way None shall pass Okay I did not want to do this but I have here the rare, mint condition, production error Star Trek: The Next Generation Geordi La Forge without his visor in the original packaging.
If you do not get out of my way I will open it.
Okay man, be cool We're all friends here What the hell is going on?
You Hypocrit!
What?
Little miss "Grown-ups- don't-play-with-toys".
If I went into that apartment right now would I not find beany babies?
are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies?
And who is that japanese feline I see frawn looking at your shorts?
Hello, hello Kitty!
Okay.
Okay,look this is about yesterday, Leonard.
I'm really sorry about what i said - I was jus upset - No, i needed to hear it No, you didn't Look you're great guy it's the things you love that make who you are I guess that makes me "Large breasts" Still I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and, you know move on with my life.
Really?
Oh Wow, good for you Thanks Hey, do you want I don't know, later Excuse me..
Hi Penny Hi Mike You're ready to go?
yeah, i just have to change I give you a hand Stop it!
Bye guys My turn on the time machine!
It worked It really worked They said i was mad, but it worked!
Oh no!
Not Morlocks!
Not flash-eating Morlocks!
Help!
Sheldon, you okay?
We have to get rid of the time machine.
It's too little big for the living room, isn't it?
yeah, that's the problem.
It's too big.
I'm glad you agreed I hired some guys to help us move it.
Come on in fellas Oh no, Morlocks!
Eat him, eat Him.
Leonard!

on the other hand,some physicists are concerned that if this supercollider actually works, it'll create a black hole and swallow up the earth, ending life as we know it.
what a bunch of crybabies.
No guts,no glory,man.
Hey,check it out.
The school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.
"We are testing a new medication "for social anxiety, panic attacks,agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder".
Why would they be looking for test subjects here?
I don't know,raj.
Maybe the comic book store doesn't have a bulletin board.
What's going on?
hot girl in sheldon's office.
Sheldon's office?
Is she lost?
I don't think so.
I followed her here from the parking lot.
Maybe she's his lawyer.
Well,she's free to examine my briefs.
-Howard.
-I know,I'm disgusting.
I should be punished by her.
Oh,look,I did it again.
That should do it.
Thank you for coming by.
Hello.
-Oh,hey,buddy -"buddy"?
Sorry I'm late.
I'm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.
How can you be late?
I wasn't expecting you at all.
Nobody ever expects me.
Sometimes you just look and bam!
Howard wolowitz.
Sheldon,are you gonna introduce us?
Oh,all right.
Uh,this is missy.
Missy,this is leonard and rajesh, and you've already met howard.
It's nice to meet you.
You,too,as well,also.
Yeah.
So,how do you two know each other?
Oh,he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head.
Excuse me?
She's my twin sister.
She thinks she's funny,but frankly, I've never been able to see it.
That's because you have no measurable sense of humor,shelly.
How exactly would one measure sea nse of humor?
A humormometer?
Well,I think you're delightfully droll.
Or,as the french say,trs drale.
Okay,so let me see if I got this.
Leonard,howard and I'm sorry,what was your name again?
Rajesh.
Proudly Presents theory Season 1 Episode 15 So missy,what brings you all the way from texas?
Was it perhaps destiny?
I think it was destiny.
My friend's getting married at disneyland tomorrow night.
Destiny,thy name is anaheim.
And I had to drop off some papers for shelly to sign for my dad's estate.
The papers could've been mailed.
Mom just sent you here to spy on me,didn't she?
I guess that's why they call you a genius.
They call me a genius because I'm a genius.
Tell mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds and that I'm having regular bowel movements.
Enjoy the wedding.
Good-bye.
If the wedding's not until tomorrow, why don't you stay with us tonight?
Oh,I don't think so.
Shelly doesn't like company.
Even as a little boy, he'd send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.
They were not friends.
They were imaginary colleagues.
Look,you're here.
We have plenty of room.
No,we don'T.
Come on,shelly.
She's family.
So what,ion't issue invitations to your mother.
Well,it would be nice not to have to drive to anaheim in rush hour.
And don't ever call me shelly.
So it's settled: You'll stay with us.
Yeah,I'll walk you to your car.
You're in structure What just happened?
So anyway,we're eight years old and sheldon converts my easy bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace.
just classic.
I needed a place to fire ceramic semiconductor substrates for homemade integrated circuits.
He was trying to build some sort of armed robot to keep me out of his room.
Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
Anyway,I go to make those little corn muffins they give you.
There's a big flash.
Next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.
not your eyebrows.
Yep,I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my mom drew on.
Is that what that was?
I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.
hey,leonard,you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.
Those are not mine.
Really?
They have your little name label in them.
Yeah no,I do I I use those,uh, just to polish up my spearfishing equipment.
I spearfish.
When I'm not crossbow hunting,I spearfish.
Uh,penny,this is sheldon's twin sister,missy.
-Missy,this is our neighbor,penny.
-Hi.
you don't look that much alike.
Can I get a hallelujah?
Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs.
They are no more alike than any other siblings.
Hallelujah!
Hey,guess what.
I've been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness.
Oh,good for you,raj.
Yes,I'm very hopeful.
Hello,missy.
They mentioned there may be side effects.
So,missy,have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of india?
Well,there's dr.
Patel at our church.
Ah,yes,patel-- good man.
Do you like motorcycles?
'Cause I ride a hog.
A hog?
You have a two-cylinder scooter with a basket in the front.
You still have to wear a helmet.
Have you ever heard of the kama sutra?
-The sex book.
-the indian sex book.
In other words,if you "wonder,wonder who wrote the book of love," it was us.
-So,sheldon's sister is pretty cute -I wasn't staring.
I didn't say you were.
I just said she was cute.
Oh,maybe,if you like women who are tall and perfect.
Sheldon,why are you ignoring your sister?
I'm not ignoring my sister.
I'm ignoring all of you.
I brought snacks!
Oh,my,gherkins and onion dip.
It's onion dip.
We don't entertain much.
Missy.
Do you enjoy pajamas?
I guess.
Yeah,we indians invented them.
You're welcome.
Yeah,well,my people invented circumcision.
You're welcome.
Missy,I'm gonna go get my nails done.
-Do you want to come?
-God,yes.
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.
Bye,guys.
-Bye,missy.
-Bye,missy,see you.
-Good-bye,leonard.
-Oh,yeah,no,uh,bye,penny.
Okay,you two have to back off.
Why should I back off?
You back off,dude.
Excuse me,this is my apartment,and she's my roommate's sister.
So what?
You've already got penny!
How do I have penny?
In what universe do I have penny?
-So I can have penny?
-Hell,no!
Excuse me.
Can I interject something?
I'm ordering pizza online.
Is everyone okay with pepperoni?
-Sheldon,can I talk to you in private?
-I guess.
Don't worry.
I was going to order you cheese-less.
-Thank you.
-It's okay.
Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.
I'm a fancy indian man.
We invented pajamas.
Hey,look at me.
I don't have a foreskin.
Sheldon are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?
she certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable.
It's noteworthy,at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.
-That's fascinating,but -I didn't say it was fascinating.
I said it was noteworthy.
All right,but noted.
My point is that koothrappali and wolowitz, they're hitting on your sister.
Oh,it'S oh,ay.
You know,I don't want to criticize your rhetorical style, but we'd be a lot further along in this conversation if you'd begun with that thought.
That's great,but my what I'm saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.
Whatever.
-You have to do something about it.
-Why?
Because she's your sister.
I don't understand.
Yes,we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we've pretty much gone our own separate ways.
Okay,uh,consider this with your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that missy chooses a suitable mate.
I hadn't considered that.
We do share dna.
So there is the possibility,however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.
Exactly.
And you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring.
You're right.
If someone wants to get at missy's fallopian tubes, they'll have to go through me.
I am shiva the destroyer!
I will have the woman.
I'm warnin ug yo I was judo champion at math camp.
All right,now that's enough juvenile squabbling.
You stop it.
Stop it,I say!
I'm going to settle this right now.
Neither of you are good enough for my sister.
Who are you to decide that?
He's the man of his family.
You have to respect his wishes.
-You're out,too,by the way.
-Say what?
It's nothing personal.
I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn't become flatulent every time they ate an eskimo pie.
What are you so happy about?
I'm not happy.
It's the medication.
I can't stop smiling.
Now that leonard's made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.
Wait a minute.
Leonard made you aware of that?
We all make mistakes.
Let's move on.
Excuse me,but I think you're missing a big opportunity here.
How so?
Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring.
Why not put a little mocha in the family latte?
In principle,you have a point.
But as a practical matter,need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.
I think you're focusing entirely too much on the drugs.
Is it 'cause I'm jewish?
'Cause I'd kill my rabbi with a pork chop to be with your sister.
This has nothing to do with religion.
This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny,tiny man who still lives with his mother.
Sheldon,you are really being unreasonable.
Am I?
Here,eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
Oh,really?
Shelly,can I speak to you for a minute?
Alone.
Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone?
Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.
We all make mistakes.
Let's move on.
Okay,I'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese.
But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?
Well,truthfully,I've never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry dna of great potential.
-What on earth are you talking about?
-Let me explain.
You see,I'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.
And what do you mean,"mediocre stock"?
That would be you.
But residing within you,is the potential for another me.
Perhaps even taller,smarter, and less prone to freckling,a sheldon 2.0,if you will.
-"Sheldon 2.0"?
-Exactly.
Now,I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with.
If you're not attracted to the suitor, then the likelihood of conception will be reduced.
-You have got to be kidding me.
-Not at all.
Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertilization.
Okay,shelly,sit down.
Now I've lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is,as mom puts it, "one of god's special,little people".
I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird.
You know,a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds.
Of course,the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death.
Luckily for you,that's where the metaphor ended.
I thought it ended at "cuckoo".
You listen to me.
If you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me,then terrific.
Bring it on.
But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and i are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little.
Remember?
I have an alternate proposal.
Go on.
You donate eggs.
We will place them in cryogenic storage.
I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you.
That way,everybody wins.
Correction.
Missy can date whoever she wants.
Look,we have to settle this.
I agree.
Sheldon's sister is hiding at penny's because we've all been hitting on her at the same time.
She's not hiding.
She needed privacy to call her grandmother who's apparently very sick.
Oh,and then I believe she has to wash her hair.
Oh,you poor,deluded bastard.
Don't start with me,dude.
You want to go again?
Let's go.
-Sit down.
-Okay.
If we're going to fight over missy,let's do it the right way.
The honorable way.
Take that!
you want some more?
And he's down!
come on,come on!
Get up!
Stay down,bitch!
yeah!
Natural selection at work.
I weep for humanity.
Excuse me while I go tell missy the good news.
-Hey,leonard.
-Oh,hi,penny.
How's it going?
Listen,that guy mike that you were dating, is that still going on?
-pretty much.
Why?
-Nothing,just catching up.
By the way,may I speak to missy,please?
Of course.
Hi,leonard.
What's up?
Well,since you're leaving tomorrow, I was wondering if you'd like to go to dinner with me.
That's so sweet.
But no thanks.
-Do you have other plans or?
-No.
All right,enjoy the rest of your evening.
Thanks.
See ya.
here's something we didn't anticipate.
What do you want,howard?
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.
I've come to call on missy.
Missy.
Hi,howard.
The amazing howard.
-Do you like magic?
-Not really.
No.
Then you are in for a treat.
Behold,an ordinary cane.
No.
Okay.
missy.
Thank you.
I apprec apprec appreeee Oh,honey.
Is your medication wearing off?
Well,hi,tie pie.
I was hoping you'd show up.
we had a dog who made a noise like tha had to put him down.
Any news you want me to pass along to mom?
Well,she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heterotic string theory.
Yeah,I'll just tell her you say "hey".
Okay,well,it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles.
Come on,shelly.
I want you to know I'm very proud of you.
Really?
Yep,I'm always bragging to my friends about my brother, the rocket scientist.
You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?
Well,yeah.
I'm a theoretical physicist.
-What's the difference?
-What's the difference?
!
Good-bye,shelly.
My god!
Why don't you just tell them that I'm a toll-taker at the golden gate bridge?
!
Rocket scientist.
How humiliating.

- Take him down!
- He's got you, Sheldon.
- Look at this move!
- He's completely schooling you.
Hey, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.
It's called Tresling.
It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of Tetris into the ultimate sport.
That's terrific, but they wanted me to ask you to cut it the hell out.
Great.
Come here, guys.
Come on.
Happy birthday to you We might as well stop.
It's a stalemate.
You're beating me in Tetris, but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler elf.
Keebler elf?
I've got your Keebler elf right here.
Okay, it's a stalemate.
So, Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday - for your free birthday cheesecake?
- He can't eat cheesecake.
- He's lactose intolerant.
- He can have carrot cake.
- What about the cream cheese frosting?
- He can scrape it off.
Forget about the cake.
How do you know my birthday's Saturday?
I did your horoscope, remember?
I was gonna do everybody's, until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.
For the record, "that psychotic rant" was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who, in 1948, proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments that astrology is nothing but pseudo-scientific hokum.
Blah, blah, blah.
Typical Taurus.
Are we gonna see you Saturday?
- I don't think so.
- Why not?
- I don't celebrate my birthday.
- Shut up.
Yeah, you do.
It's no big deal; it's just the way I was raised.
My parents focused on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.
That's so silly.
It's actually based on very sound theories.
- His mother published a paper on it.
- What was it called?
"I Hate My Son and That's Why He Can't Have Cake"?
It was obviously effective.
Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist.
Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas, he'd be a little better at it.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Well, I love birthdays.
Waking up to Mom's special French toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends Yeah, see?
That's what kids should have.
Actually, that was last year.
So you really never had a birthday party?
No, but it was okay.
When I was little, I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind and surprise me with a party.
Like this one birthday I came home from my cello lesson and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front.
When I got to the door, I could hear people whispering and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favorite.
And?
It turns out my grandfather had died.
Oh, my God.
That's terrible.
Well, it was kind of like a birthday party.
I got to see all my cousins, and there was cake, so It's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
You think?
Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom.
Episode 116: The Peanut Reaction Make sure they remember, no peanuts.
Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts.
When they see me coming, they go, "Ah, no-peanut boy"!
- Hello, Penny.
Leonard just left.
- I know.
I want to talk to you.
What would we talk about?
We have no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of.
As you know, I don't care for chitchat.
- Can you just let me in?
- All right, but I don't see this as a promising endeavor.
Here's the deal.
We're gonna throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party - for his birthday on Saturday.
- I hardly think so.
Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party.
Did someone say "party"?
He just doesn't know he wants one 'cause he's never had one.
I suppose that's possible, but for the record, I've never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.
Howard, here's the difference The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.
Fine.
If I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it.
I'm just kidding.
Yes, you can.
Can you bring a friend?
I think a birthday party's a terrible idea.
I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.
Anguish?
!
Year after year, I had to endure wearing comical hats while being forced into the crowded, sweaty hell of bouncy castles.
Not to mention being blindfolded and spun toward a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.
Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no nonprofessional can heal, but, nevertheless, we're going to throw Leonard a birthday party.
Have I pointed out that I'm extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol-induced frivolity?
- Nevertheless - In addition, I Here's the deal: You either help me throw a birthday party or I will go into your bedroom and unbag all of your most valuable mint-condition comic books.
And on one of them, you won't know which, I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.
You can't do that.
If you make a mark in a mint comic, it's no longer mint.
Do you understand the concept of blackmail?
Well, of course, I I have an idea.
Let's throw Leonard a kick-ass birthday party.
That's not the secret knock.
This is the secret knock.
What difference does it make?
The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one's co-conspirators.
- Is that Raj and Howard?
- Possibly, but unverified.
Will you just let us in.
Luckily for you, this is not a nuclear reactor.
- So what'd you get the birthday boy?
- Well, Raj got him an awesome, limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross's definitive Batman.
And I got him this amazing autographed copy of The Feynman Lectures on Physics.
Nice.
I got him a sweater.
Okay, well, he might like that.
I've seen him get chilly.
- Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
- That's because I didn't bring one.
- Why not?
- Don't ask.
The entire institution of gift-giving makes no sense.
- Too late.
- Let's say I go out and I spend $50 on you.
It's a laborious activity because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need.
Now, I could simplify things just give you the $50 directly, and then you could give me $50 on my birthday, and so on, until one of us dies, leaving the other one old and $50 richer.
And I ask you, is it worth it?
Told you not to ask.
Sheldon, you're his friend.
Friends give each other presents.
I accept your premise; I reject your conclusion.
Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention.
- What?
- Just do it.
It's a non-optional social convention.
Oh.
Fair enough.
He came with a manual.
Question.
How am I going to get Leonard a present before the party?
I don't drive and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station.
I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.
Okay let's do this I will drive Sheldon to get a present.
Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard - for about 2 hours.
- No problem.
And then, Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.
What if guests show up?
Entertain them.
What if they're women?
Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable.
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.
So listen, the NuArt is showing the revised, definitive cut of Blade Runner.
Seen it.
No, you've seen the 25th Anniversary Final Cut.
This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage.
They say it completely changes the tone of the film.
Pass.
Come on.
Afterwards, there's a Q & A with Harrison Ford's body double.
Look, I'm in the Halo battle of my life here.
There's this kid in Copenhagen he has no immune system, so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24-seven.
- Can't you play him some other time?
- Not if you believe his doctors.
Oh, my God, do you smell gas?
- No.
- Yeah, no.
They have DVDs over there.
Yes, but they have DVD burners over here.
Leonard needs a DVD burner.
A gift shouldn't be something someone needs, it should be something fun.
Something they wouldn't buy for themself.
You mean like a sweater?
It's a fun sweater.
It's got a bold geometric print.
Is it the geometry that makes it fun?
The point is one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.
Okay, I see.
So, not a DVD burner.
Exactly.
Something he wouldn't buy for himself, something fun, Something like An 802-11n wireless router!
Here you go, Copenhagen boy.
How about a taste of Hans Christian hand grenade?
That could not feel good.
Come on, come Oh, you clever Come on.
Take that!
- What's the matter?
- This granola bar has peanuts in it!
- Oh, my God.
Why did you eat it?
- I don't know.
It was just there!
If I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?
Don't yell at me!
I've got to go to the emergency room!
- Now?
!
- No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket!
All right, just let me get my keys.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
The laundry is out of the hamper.
Okay, Sheldon, what was it supposed to be?
Fine.
It's out of the washer!
I'll call you when it's in the dryer.
All right, let's go.
- What do you think?
- That one.
Because of the two additional Ethernet ports?
- Sure.
- No need, he's already got a six-port Ethernet switch.
- Okay, then this one.
- Why?
I don't know.
The man on the box looks so happy.
Penny, if I'm going to buy Leonard a gift, I'm going to do it right.
I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.
I know I'm gonna regret this, but: What trauma?
On my 12th birthday, I really wanted a titanium centrifuge so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes.
Of course.
Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me This is hard.
They got me a motorized dirt bike.
What 12-year-old boy wants a motorized dirt bike?
All of them?
- Really?
- Yeah.
So we're getting this one?
- Yeah, I suppose.
- All right, let's go.
Excuse me.
Do you know anything about this stuff?
I know everything about this stuff.
Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse.
Buy this one: it's the one we're getting.
Happy guy.
No, she doesn't want that.
She needs a point-to-point peer network with a range extender.
Thank you.
Which hard drive do I want firewire or USB?
It depends on what buss you have available.
I drive a Chevy Cavalier.
Oh, dear Lord.
- We have to go.
- Not now.
This poor man needs me.
You, hold on.
I'll be right with you.
What computer do you have?
And please don't say "a white one".
- Excuse me.
- Fill this out.
Have a seat.
Listen.
We're throwing my friend a surprise party I'm supposed to keep him out of his apartment for 2 hours.
Fill this out and have a seat.
No, the only way I could get him to leave was to tell him I ate a peanut because I'm allergic to peanuts.
Well, in that case, fill this out and have a seat.
All I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a Band-Aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine, and you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for 1 hour 1/2.
- Is that all you need?
- Yes.
Get out of my ER.
- No, you don't understand.
- I understand, but unfortunately, this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid.
Okay, I get it.
I know how the world works.
How about if I were to introduce to you to the man who freed your people?
Unless my people were freed by Benjamin Franklin and his five twin brothers, you are wasting your time.
Sorry, I couldn't find a parking spot.
- How are you doing?
- Bad, very bad.
Really?
You don't look like you're swelling up at all.
We should just pick up some Benadryl at the drugstore and go home.
- We can't go home.
- Why not?
Because because Brisket!
Brisket!
- Water!
Need water!
- I'll be right back.
I've got a problem.
Well, so do I. You gotta stall Leonard a little longer.
- I don't think I can.
- You have to.
We all have to be there at the same time to yell surprise.
You have to understand something.
We're in a hospital right now.
- Why?
Is Leonard okay?
- Leonard's fine.
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking, by the way.
Okay, I don't need your attitude.
Just hold him there a little longer.
I've done my best, but he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop him.
Okay, how about this?
You keep him there a little longer, and when you get to the party, I'll point out which of my friends are easy?
Don't toy with me, woman.
I got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around a alcoholic who's 2 tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.
Thy will be done.
I'm doing this for you, little buddy.
Okay, we don't have that in stock but I can special-order it for you.
Him.
Excuse me, sir.
You don't work here.
Yes, well, apparently, neither does anyone else.
- Sheldon, we have to go.
- Why?
For one thing, we're late for Leonard's birthday party, and for another, I told him to call security.
Good luck.
By the way, a six-year-old could hack your computer system.
Keep walking.
"1234" is not a secure password.
Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts.
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.
Look, sir, we are very busy here, and I Holy crap!
Please help me!
Code four!
I need a gurney!
- Right away!
Right away!
- Thank you.
Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they're afraid of lawsuits, they sure test everything.
I really don't think the colonoscopy was necessary.
You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party.
Right, it's your birthday.
I had no idea it was your birthday.
I completely forgot.
What a lousy way to spend a birthday.
It's all over now.
There is a party, isn't there?
Maybe.
- Are you mad?
- How could I be mad?
You actually risked your life because you care about me.
Yeah, that's why I did it.
All right.
Here we go.
My first birthday party.
Dude, everybody left an hour ago.
Surprise!
Okay, Leonard.
I am at your birthday party.
I don't know where you are, dude, but it's really kick-ass!
Everyone is very, very drunk and And look, there's a girl taking her shirt off!
That's my friend Carol.
Remind me, I gotta introduce her to Howard.
Oh, sweet Krishna, shake that rupee maker!
I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.
It's okay.
Happy birthday, anyways.
When's your birthday?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
No, it's:   What's this?
That's what you did.
I assumed, as in a number of languages, that the gesture was part of the phrase.
- Well, it's not.
- Why am I supposed to know that?
As teacher, it's your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.
- I'm glad you decided to learn Mandarin.
- Why?
Once you're fluent, you'll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.
Hey.
You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey.
My apologies, Leonard.
I'm only as good as my teacher.
Why are you learning Chinese?
I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken, and I intend to confront them.
If I were you, I'd be more concerned about what they're passing off as chicken.
- I need to use your window.
- Oh, hey.
Yeah, no, sure, go ahead.
Hey, jerk face.
You forgot your iPod.
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.
That stupid, self-centered bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog.
Drop dead, you stupid, self-centered bastard.
Thank you.
Okay, where were we?
Not now.
I have a blog to find.
Penny, are you okay?
I'm fine, Leonard.
Just go away.
I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful-- - Go away!
- Okay, feel better, bye.
She doesn't wanna talk.
Not surprising.
Penny's emotional responses originate in the primitive portion of brain, the amygdala.
While speech is centered in the recently developed neocortex.
Former can overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.
Or maybe she just doesn't wanna talk.
Hey, look, I found an iPod.
It's smashed beyond repair.
What are you gonna do with it?
What else?
Sell it on eBay as slightly used.
It was Penny's boyfriend's.
They broke up.
Apparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog which I cannot find anywhere.
You know what?
I'm gonna go back and try talking to her again.
Good idea.
Sit with her, hold her, comfort her.
And if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel.
I'm not going to do that, Howard.
I'm not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.
What about damsel in distress?
Twelfth-century code of chivalry?
Not exactly current.
You'd also have to be knighted for that to apply.
I don't care.
She's upset, I'm going over there.
Remember to sit on your hands a bit so they're warm.
I'm her friend.
I'm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.
So you're saying, if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her right there, right now, you'll just walk away?
I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.
Hey, I know you said you didn't wanna talk-- - I don't.
- Okay, sorry.
- Wait.
- Wait.
Did you say wait?
Tell me the truth.
Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?
No, no.
Okay, so I pick good guys, but turn them into losers?
Of course not.
Well, it's gotta be one or the other.
Which is it?
I'm sorry.
What were the choices again?
I really thought Mike was different.
I thought he was sensitive and smart.
I mean, not you smart.
- Normal non-freaky smart.
- Yeah, no, sure.
You know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.
Actually, it's not all that easy to find.
Yeah, really?
Well, my friends at work found it, my sister found it.
Judging by my e-mail, a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it.
What exactly did this guy write?
Not that I need to know the details of your sex life.
I just thought.
Never mind.
No, you know what?
Might as well read it, everybody else has.
Go ahead.
Oh, God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed.
I just wanna crawl into a hole and die.
Okay, well, you know, this isn't that bad.
It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who's open to expressing her affection in nontraditional locales.
Oh, God.
Elevators, parks, movie theaters.
Out of curiosity is this subway, the transportation system, or Subway, the sandwich shop?
Sandwich shop.
Doesn't that violate the health code or?
No, at the sub shop, we were only making out.
Ah, okay.
But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.
Really?
Do you think I overreacted?
- Maybe a little.
- Because I do that, I do overreact.
- Maybe I should call Mike and apologize.
- No, no.
No, that would be under-reacting.
He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and in your case, the elevator, parks and fast-food franchise.
Yes, you're right.
I should just say I am done with him.
Yes you should.
Go ahead, say it.
But I never gave the man a chance to explain.
What is there to explain?
It's all right here.
It's betrayal.
No, you were right the first time.
This is a man who loves me but in his own stupid way was just trying to show people how he feels.
I'm pretty sure I never said that.
No, you did better than that.
You helped me see it on my own.
Oh, good for me.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going over to Mike's.
- Leonard, thank you so much.
- Oh, sure.
Huh.
Maybe I am her gay friend.
Howard, I'm going to need another Mandarin lesson.
I obviously didn't make my point with those people.
For God's sake, if you don't like tangerine chicken don't order tangerine chicken.
I like tangerine chicken.
I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.
- Can we please change the subject?
- Sure.
Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.
Just roll the dice.
"Enslaved by warlocks.
Stay here till you roll two, four or--" She was mad at him.
She was done with him, the relationship was broken and I walked over there and I fixed it.
Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it.
I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling.
Previously, I felt sympathy for the Leonard character.
Now I just find him to be whiny and annoying.
Just eat your tangerine chicken.
I'd love to, but I don't have tangerine chicken.
Thank you so much for your stupid advice.
Incredible.
You managed to screw up the screw-up.
I'm back.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's not your fault.
What happened?
Well, I went over to Mike's to make up with him-- Yeah, no, I know that part.
But he had already moved on.
Already?
That was quick.
That's what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck.
Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.
How could he do that?
Oh, you know, you did throw an 80-gig iPod-- Yeah, no, how could he do that?
I swear to God, I am done with guys like that.
You know, macho with the perfect body, and the hair and the money.
Yeah, that must get old quick.
You know, just once, I would like to go out with someone who is nice and honest and who actually cares about me.
What about me?
What about you what?
What about if you went out with me?
Are you asking me out?
Um, yes, I am asking you out.
Wow.
I was just going off your comment about the nice guy-- - No, I got that.
- And honest-- - Yeah, totally.
- So but.
- It's no big deal.
- Yes.
Yes, what?
Yes, I will go out with you.
Really?
Yeah.
Why not?
I mean, what do I have to lose?
Yeah.
That's the spirit.
Show me your citrus peels.
Show me your citrus peels.
- Show me-- - Sheldon?
I'm sorry.
Look, do you have a second?
A second what?
Pair of underwear?
I was just wondering if I could talk to you.
It's about Leonard.
Why me?
Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?
Well, Raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk.
And Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.
Yes, I suppose he is.
All I'm saying is you know Leonard the best.
Not necessarily.
I'm often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard.
Just the other day, I discovered he not only has a loofah, he hides it.
Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah?
I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally but I don't condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.
And until recently, I had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance he can tolerate small amounts of nonfat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that, I maintain, in the right concentration could be weaponized.
Leonard might come home.
Can we talk in my apartment?
We're not done?
- No.
- Eh, why not?
We're already through the looking glass anyway.
Okay, so here's the thing.
I guess you're aware that Leonard asked me out.
Well, he didn't actually say anything.
But when he came back to the apartment, he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia.
Oh, that's nice.
Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to about is you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just-- Wanna sit down?
Oh, I wish it were that simple.
You see, I don't spend much time here, and so I've never chosen a place to sit.
Well, choose.
There are a number of options and.
I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities air-flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.
Why don't you pick at random, if you don't like it, sit somewhere else next time?
No, no, that's crazy.
You go ahead and talk while I figure it out.
Okay.
Here's the thing.
So I've known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me-- A little crush?
Well, I suppose so.
In the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy.
I don't really know who they are-- - Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon-- - Yeah, I don't care.
Listen.
The point is Leonard isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with.
Leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with.
Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?
No.
What I'm saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way.
And obviously, my usual choices have not worked out so well.
Your last one worked out well for Koothrappali.
He got a free iPod.
Oh, glare.
But on the other hand if things don't go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend.
I mean, he's not looking for a fling.
He's the kind that gets into a relationship for, like you would say, light-years.
I would not say that.
No one would say that.
A light-year is a unit of distance, not time.
Thank you for the clarification.
Draft.
You see, people hear the word "year" and they think duration.
Foot-pound has the same problem.
That's a unit of work, not of weight.
Right.
Thanks.
- It's a common mistake.
- Not the first one I've made today.
Okay.
I think this will be my seat.
Do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I'm talking about?
Well, let's see.
We might consider SchrÃ dinger's cat.
SchrÃ dinger.
Is that the woman in 2A?
No, that's Mrs. Grossinger.
She doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless.
Annoying little animal.
Yip-yip-yip.
Sheldon.
Sorry, you diverted me.
Anyway, in 1935, Erwin SchrÃ dinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment.
A cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time.
Now, since no one knows when or if the poison has been released until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.
I'm sorry, I don't get the point.
Well, of course you don't get it.
I haven't made it yet.
You have to be psychic, there's no such thing-- Sheldon, what's the point?
Just like SchrÃ dinger's cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad.
It is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is.
Okay, so you're saying I should go out with Leonard?
No, no, no.
Let me start again.
In 1935, Erwin SchrÃ dinger.
Two seats right there.
Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.
I can see that.
Unless you're running a marathon choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch-filled redundancy.
No, it's about Penny.
A mistake involving Penny.
Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.
I don't think I can go out with her tonight.
Then don't.
Other people would say, "Why not"?
Other people might be interested.
- I'm gonna talk anyway.
- I assumed you would.
Now that I'm actually about to go out with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.
Then your meal choice is appropriate.
Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion.
- Right.
- You also made a grammatical mistake.
You said "nauseous" when you meant "nauseated".
But go on.
Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny.
What happens if I blow it?
Well, if we accept your premise and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny.
The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby-Doo cartoons comes to mind.
You're not helping.
All right, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a conclusion?
Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
SchrÃ dinger's cat.
Wow, that's brilliant.
You sound surprised.
Mmm.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Come on in.
- Thank you.
You look very nice.
Thank you.
So do you.
I made an 8:00 reservation.
Okay, yeah, great.
Listen.
Maybe we should talk first.
Oh.
Okay.
But before you say anything, have you ever heard of SchrÃ dinger's cat?
Actually, I've heard far too much about SchrÃ dinger's cat.
Good.
All right, the cat's alive.
Let's go to dinner.
