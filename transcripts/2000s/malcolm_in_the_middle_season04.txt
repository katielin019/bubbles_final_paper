{START OF EPISODE 1}
Malcolm!
Reese!
No playing ball in the house!
No playing ball on the house!
No playing ball through the house!
This isn't even fun.
That stopped being the point a long time ago.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now - You're not - the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Oh, for God's sake, Malcolm.
This is the last time I'm going to tell you.
Get up right now!
I'll get up when the world stops being a cruel joke, which is never!
Malcolm, you smell like a locker room.
This has got to stop.
You've wasted your entire summer - lying in bed feeling - sorry for yourself.
- Your father thinks - we sent you away to camp.
- You're right.
- I'm a pathetic loser.
: Honey this is just a phase.
Every teenager goes through it.
I did, your father did.
Francis cried in the shower every day for six months.
Reese wouldn't get out of the dryer.
It's awkward and it's painful and you think it's never going to end.
Now get out of bed!
We're going to the zoo.
Why are we going to go stare - at a bunch - of pathetic, caged animals And fat, suburban yahoos pointing and laughing at them?
Because I have a coupon.
Is the zoo one of the places where you have - to be this tall - to do the good stuff?
I don't know.
- I've never been there - when it's open.
- This is going - to be so much fun.
- I'm so glad I ran - into Matt.
- Yeah, that was quite - a lucky break.
- Good old, - good old Matt.
It has been 20 years since I was dating the both of you.
- I can't believe - you're still jealous.
I am not jealous.
I'm not even the jealous type.
I was just trying to read the meter!
- Not in those shorts, - Tarzan!
Why don't you just marry Tom Cruise?
!
Okay, that's enough.
Break it up.
Hello.
-  - Hi, Dad.
Francis!
How's it going?
Couldn't be going better, Dad.
We're seeing the country, meeting great people.
This is the best time of our lives.
Well I guess your mom and I were really wrong about your cross-country plan.
- We thought - it would be a disaster.
- I'm not going to rub - your face in it, Dad.
We're having too much fun!
No, thanks, Joe, - I couldn't take - another bite of pie.
- This trip has been - so good for us.
We have seen so many things.
Majestic mountains, quiet little towns, emergency opportunities for charitable giving That's great.
- It sounds like you are - really making it out there.
Yeah, so, about these charitable - Listen, we're on our way - to the zoo right now, - But you call us back - next week, okay?
Love to Piama.
Oh, look how nice this is.
And it's such a beautiful day.
You have to stop making that noise.
Fine, Mom, I won't breathe.
- You know, son, I hate - to see you like this.
I tell you what.
Why don't we get you a wax crocodile?
-  - Can we see the tigers?
- I'm going to go - hit the monkeys.
- I mean, go see - the monkeys.
Look, Matt's Animals of the Rain Forest show starts in 20 minutes.
- Gee, don't want - to miss that.
Can I just go wait in the car?
- I mean, it's technically - at the zoo.
No.
And since you're so committed to being miserable, - you can be in charge of your - little brother for the day.
- No.
- Great.
- Let's look At every animal first, then decide which ones we want to go back to.
Meet back here at 5:00!
- Let go of me.
I don't want to be - your baby-sitter.
I just want to be by myself.
Are you mad?
I'm not mad.
You sound mad.
Fine, I'm mad!
Who are you mad at?
I'm not mad!
Look, you wouldn't understand.
- Yes, I would.
- No, you wouldn't.
You're still living in your kiddie dream world.
- You don't realize - you're nothing - But an insignificant - speck of dust Lost in an uncaring universe full of random tragedy.
What's a lemur?
- Oh, look, there's Matt.
- Hi, Matt!
Lo-lo!
Hi!
Hey, Matt.
Quite a zoo you got here.
I got to tell you, - this is an exciting day - for us.
- We don't often get a chance - to spend time with the family.
- You know how it is - Work, work, work!
- But to tell you the truth, - it's mostly my boss.
- He gets off - on cracking the whip.
- You know, - he's a real bastard.
But I got a feeling that he's about to get the axe.
At least that's what Jimbo in marketing says.
- So good to see - you, Matt.
- Yeah.
- I knew you'd end up - doing something like this.
- You always had all - those cute animals.
Well, you didn't think Monty was so cute.
I hated that snake!
- Remember the time I - found him in the shower?
Hey, are your kids here?
I'd love to meet them.
Oh, yeah, yeah, they're around.
You'll recognize them.
They all look like me.
So, who's this little guy, huh?
Do you want this?
Too slow.
Hey, watch where you're going.
Big mistake, pal!
You want to go?
We'll go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What are you doing?
He started it.
Goats don't start it.
Get out.
Guess what I get to do.
Leave.
If we push the car till we find a mechanic, - we can pay - with aluminum cans Francis, we've been pushing the car for two days.
I'm tired and I'm hungry.
I'm going to buy something to eat.
- No, no, no!
- Get lottery tickets.
- This is exactly - the kind of time When these things pay off.
Honey, we're not spending our last five dollars - on lottery tickets.
- That's crazy.
Now I'm going in there and I'm buying food.
Food.
Like adults eat.
No wonder you were $3,000 under blue book.
: Cadillac?
Yeah.
1974?
If you say so.
She is a beauty!
I love your American cars.
BMW could learn a thing or two but no, everything has to be about perfect engineering.
Otto, what are you doing?
Who is this handsome boy?
Hi, I'm Francis.
I am talking cars with my new American friend.
- And yes, - he is very handsome.
So, Francis, you also come to the Circle K for the wonderful hot dogs?
Actually, we were just sort of passing through and our car broke down.
This is so lucky for you.
This is a wonderful place.
- We own a dude ranch - just nearby With cows and horses and people.
We don't own the people.
- We call it - "The Grotto".
- She is Gretchen, - I am Otto Grotto.
- You should come - and visit, eh?
Oh, thanks, but I'm out of work and we're kind of broke right now.
Wait!
I am having a thought!
Eh, it's gone.
He could work for us at the ranch.
That was my thought!
We need a ranch foreman.
- Wait.
I don't know - the first thing about ranching.
Ah, you will learn.
I can tell you are clever.
Really, I've never Look me in the eye.
Yeah, I can tell.
It is the job for you.
Pays $200 a week plus free room and board.
Done.
I have one question.
Yeah?
This isn't going to end up - with me cut up - into little pieces - And buried in a secret basement, - is it?
Nope.
You got a deal.
Okay, I got lottery tickets.
We don't need 'em.
Go away!
Get out of here!
I'm warning you.
I'm not falling for your goat mind games.
- If nothing I do - ever has any meaning, - Then I can't care - about anything, - Which makes me feel - even worse.
How am I supposed to ever feel happy?
Kid, I'm a zoo clown.
Now buy a giraffe or go to hell.
See, Dewey, there's a guy who understands.
- Malcolm, - you're at the zoo.
You have a Popsicle.
How can you be unhappy?
I wanted grape.
Tigers!
Where are they?
They're not here.
What a gyp!
- See, that's - what I mean.
The one thing you were excited about, closed.
Maybe they're down here.
- Or maybe there never were - any tigers And they just put up the signs - to build a sense - of disappointment  Dewey!
I'm okay.
You idiot, what the hell's wrong with you?
Come on.
Let's get out of here before we get caught.
Okay, Cookie, it's payday.
Oh, that must happen a lot in the rain forest.
Okay, if I could have another volunteer.
He was pointing at me.
Oh, uh okay.
Uh - Could you tell everyone - your name, sir?
I'm Hal.
Lois's husband.
- Well, Hal, are you - feeling adventurous?
Would you like to meet another friend from the rain forest?
-  - Ooh, I don't know.
Animals that can withstand rain Well, we better hurry, because the needless destruction of the rain forest is going on at an alarming rate.
It's threatening thousands of helpless species each year like the beautiful and gentle bird-eating tarantula.
Now I know Victor looks dangerous, but the tarantula is actually a very gentle and timid creature.
I am so sorry.
Victor's never done anything like that before.
Once the swelling goes down, the fangs should fall out.
This is where you will stay.
It's a guest cabin, but you can do whatever you want to make it feel homey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Move your furniture, put up pictures.
If you want to hammer a sandwich to the wall, you can do it.
So, Francis, tell me, you like horses?
I honestly have no idea.
I love horses.
Their bodies are so big and their feet are so tiny, they make me laugh.
This is just so generous and nice of you.
- This place - is so beautiful.
I never want to leave.
Oh, this is what happened to Otto.
We were on vacation and Otto was so happy to be away from - the stress of running - the factory.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
per day, and if you make one teeny little mistake, boy, do you hear about it.
- Don't move, don't - move, don't move You've been saying that for 20 minutes.
I still mean it.
Do you think he's mad?
I don't know.
I don't think it matters.
Just stay quiet and try not to look like meat.
- Hey, I don't - think you kids - Are supposed to be - messing around down there.
Yeah, thank you.
- Would you mind going - to tell somebody That we're down here, please?
Oh, for the love of God.
I don't think those kids are supposed to be down there.
Get us out of here!
Okay, okay calm down.
- We train - for situations like this, And there are standard procedures we follow.
- What's the limit - on our liability?
No, the press release has to sound sympathetic to the boys.
- But make it clear - it's their fault.
No, I gave you back the key to the rifle closet.
Oh, yes I did!
Hey, you folks see the koalas?
Okay, let's take a look.
How is it?
It's much better.
It stopped weeping.
- Someone wants to say - he's sorry.
Apology accepted.
- Okay, I'm going to go take - another look for the boys.
- Why don't you - just rest?
- Hal, I don't know - what to say.
I just feel awful about what happened.
Do you really?
Of course I do.
- Come on, man, - I think we both know - That you've been - holding a grudge Because Lois chose me over you.
Lois chose Wait a minute.
Is that what you think?
I just hope this makes us even, because I can't feel my feet and you're kind of upside-down.
Hal, you've got it all wrong.
I wasn't angry at you.
The whole situation was just too much for me, so I backed off.
What?
I mean, Lois is great, - but I wanted to be - exclusive and she didn't.
On any given weekend, I didn't know if she was with you or me or Dennis Dennis?
Who's Dennis?
No one.
I got to go.
about which one of us - was going to be eaten - by a tiger.
Now I can relax.
Okay, kids, the tigers didn't go for the steaks we threw down.
The problem is they're attracted to you because you're alive, like their natural prey.
There's a "but" coming, right?
Well, no.
But we have things under control.
We're going to fire tranquilizer darts at the tigers.
How long do they take to work?
Less than two minutes.
So, the plan is - to piss them off - and keep them awake - Just long enough so they can - take it out on us?
Hold on a sec.
- Okay, these people - are idiots.
Malcolm, it'll be okay.
- Yeah, Dewey, I hope so, too, - but I'm not hoping.
I know it'll be fine.
You can't know that.
Yes, I can.
No, you can't.
Yes, I can.
I do.
I know we'll be fine.
Okay, just sit tight a few more minutes.
Apparently they had a similar situation in D.C., and we're trying to find out exactly what went wrong there.
But the main thing is everything's going to be okay.
See?
Sorry.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me, I need - to get through.
I'm looking for my kids.
There's no kids here, that's for sure.
- Lois?
- Hal?
- What are you doing here?
- You should be lying down.
Yes, I should, but then I had a conversation with Matt who informed me that there was another guy you were dating while you were dating us.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God Hal Hal, I'm sorry.
I I meant to tell you.
I-I should have told you.
- I just I could never find - the right time, And I was never that serious about Larry anyway.
Who the hell is Larry?
I'm talking about Dennis!
Dennis, right, that's who I meant.
Oh, my God, who are you?
- Hal, please - can we discuss this tonight?
Well, I don't know, Lois.
Maybe you have a date.
- Okay, in the first place, - this was all over 20 years ago.
And second, it doesn't matter because I love you.
And third, you were the one dating that slut manicurist!
Here is where we put the houses for the horses.
And here will be your office.
You have pens in one drawer and paper in the other.
First, I put them in the same drawer together, but no, that did not work.
But if you want to try it that way, you're the boss, huh?
Ah, here is Zeke.
Zeke, meet Francis.
Howdy.
How y'all doing?
He is the new ranch foreman.
- He will be in charge - of the livestock, Of the feeding schedules, of the equipment rental well, everything.
I must go and set up the buffet.
I'm sure you have lots of cowboy things to talk about, huh?
- All right, look, I might - as well tell you now, - 'cause you're going to find out - in about 30 seconds anyway.
I'm not a real cowboy.
My name isn't even Zeke, it's Murray, and I have no idea what in the hell I'm doing around here.
You have no idea?
- I've never worked on a ranch - in my life.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I've never even been - Near a horse - you don't put quarters in.
Oh, that's great.
Listen, you know, you stepped into a gold mine here.
I mean, the people who run this place are absolute idiots.
- Oh, I don't know.
- They seem really nice.
"Nice" isn't the word for it.
- I mean, you don't have - to do a lick of work And they'll still pay you.
- You're kidding?
- I'm telling you, - All we got to do - is watch each other's backs - And we can milk these people - for all they're worth.
What do you think?
I think you're fired.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to find out if this is for me or the horse.
-  - You broke our agreement!
What agreement?
!
We never had an agreement!
It was a mutual understanding!
At least on my end!
You are overreacting.
- So, I was dating a few guys - when we met - What difference - does it make?
- A few?
Well, how many - were there, Lois?
Don't you get it?
It doesn't matter.
You won!
It's history.
It's over.
Your engagement ring is not a family heirloom.
What?
- I lied to you.
- I bought it.
So you bought it.
For someone else.
Someone else?
I'm sorry.
- I have kept that secret - for so many years.
It's haunted me.
Look, I always knew that I had to tell you, but I didn't know how.
Who was it?
Farrah Fawcett.
I was 15.
- I knew there were - a lot of guys after her, But I thought that if I had an actual ring to give her that I would stand apart from those other idiots.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before now.
Well, why don't we just call it even.
: Hey, Randy, it's Bill.
- Are those two kids still trapped - in the tiger den?
Okay, everybody, calm down.
Calm down.
- I'm obviously just picking up - a transmission From the zoo down the road.
Reese and Malcolm?
Malcolm and Dewey.
Reese wouldn't last 30 seconds.
I think Stanley's getting angry.
You named them?
That's Stanley.
That's French Fry.
Dewey, I want to tell you something.
I love you.
Don't say that!
It's true.
I love you so much.
You're just saying that - 'cause you think - we're going to die.
- This is all part of - your hating life thing.
- You're wrong.
- I love life.
I realize that now.
It's imperfect, but I love that, too.
- And I love Mom and Dad - and Francis - And even Reese.
- I love you all.
- Stop it.
We're - going to be fine.
Why don't you stop it, Dewey?
- Why don't you stop pretending - everything's great - And tell me - you love me, okay?
We're not going to die!
- Yes, we are!
- We're going to die!
This is the ultimate proof that I was right all along!
- And I don't need - some stupid little kid Giving me fake reassurances!
Well, I don't need some crybaby brother taking all the fun out of being at the zoo!
Oh, my God!
- You're just - in a bad mood.
We'll get out of this.
- No, we won't.
- Give it up, Dewey.
- Superman isn't going - to fly in here and save us.
In your face, goat!
Who's laughing  Open up, open up!
Ever since the zoo, I've had a new lease on life.
- It's amazing - how something as simple As almost being eaten by tigers can put things in perspective.
It just feels so good to be happy again.
Of course, why do I - always have to learn my lessons - the hard way?
No one else does.
- I mean, why does the universe - think it has to almost kill me To get a point across?
My life sucks.
I'm going to bed.
- No, Francis, - everything turned out fine.
We agreed not to sue them, - and they agreed - not to throw Reese in jail.
- Enough about that.
- Tell me about your new job.
Oh, it's great.
I've learned so much already.
Say, while you were at the zoo, you didn't happen to see any animals giving birth, did you?
No.
Why?
Just curious.
Never mind.
Almost there, sweetie.
Just one more push.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Hello.
Dad, hi.
Oh, Francis.
- How's the new job?
- Oh, it's good.
- I'm learning all kinds - of new things.
I got lots of responsibility.
- I'm actually making - some good money.
Hey, good for you.
Dad, listen, I know I owe you guys a lot of money - and I want to start - paying you back.
So I'm sending you $50 this month, and then my plan is What do you need $50 for?
No, I'm sending you $50.
Francis, I can't spare $50.
No, I'm sending you the money Just give him the $50.
We have to go.
All right, your mother says it's okay, but we have to go.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?

It's the first day of school.
Everyone else is bummed, - but I'm actually excited - about it.
- I'm officially done - with junior high.
I'm not a Krelboyne anymore.
I can be whatever I want to be.
I don't have to worry about labels or cliques or who's cool.
I'm going into high school.
By the way, this is an excited twitch, not a nervous twitch.
Can we please just eat our breakfast and stop all this complaining?
But I don't understand.
Why do we have to volunteer for the whole first week?
Because we got caught, Hal.
- We ducked out - for 12 years.
- They were bound - to get us eventually.
Dewey, come here.
- Listen, you're - going to be Coming home from school at 3:00 this year.
So this is the key to the house.
You will come straight home, you will let yourself in - and you will be - in this house alone - Until your - brothers get here - Exactly 15 minutes - later, and not One second more!
We're giving this to you because we trust you.
Congratulations.
You're now a latchkey kid.
Point four miles to go.
- Malcolm, - if any big kids bother you, - You go straight - to your old teacher.
- I'm not going to Mr. Herkabe - for anything.
Point two.
Why not?
He's the new dean of discipline.
Talk about having friends in high places.
He's not a friend, he's a psychopath.
- He's been out to get me - since the day we met.
He actually told me that.
What the heck is wrong with this stupid car?
I've gone 30 miles since the gas light came on last night, and we're still going.
- Hal, look.
- There's the parking lot.
- You can - let us out here.
- Yeah, Dad, here's good.
Don't be silly.
We're all going to the same place.
- Hal, look.
- A spot right up front.
Right next to the cheerleaders.
- Thanks for what - you did back there.
- The firecracker - did all the work.
- That's the good thing - about cheerleaders.
They stampede easy.
- Let's get inside - before Mom and Dad see - Ah, the golden boy - has returned.
Release the doves.
Hi, Mr. Herkabe.
And you must be Reese.
I have been thoroughly briefed on you, and if you do one thing wrong, - I'm going to go medieval - on your permanent record.
Ask yourself, whatever happened to the old dean of discipline?
-  - Mr. Herkabe.
- Good morning.
- It is so exciting - Being here on the - first day of school.
- Yes.
It's like being - at the cockfights Before they open the cages.
- So the two hours a day does - that include travel time?
- Because there was - a lot of traffic.
So, you'll be handing out health forms and you report to the North Field.
Can't we do something together?
Let me check.
Uh no.
But don't we both - feel better - knowing we tried?
I am so sorry.
- I'll have your horse - ready in two minutes.
- We're a little - shorthanded today.
- I had to help - make breakfast.
- You'll be riding - Sparky here.
- I'll get him saddled - right up for you.
- Would you like a - croissant while you wait?
- Oh, sure.
- Good morning, Francis.
What a beautiful day.
Otto, can I talk to you?
Yeah.
How is your lovely wife?
You know, you should start having babies right away.
And you must breast-feed.
Yeah, listen.
- What happened - to Bill and Andy?
- Neither one of them showed up - for their shifts today.
Bill and Andy are on vacation.
I thought I told you.
- Well, who's supposed to - be covering for them?
Let us have a look.
Ah, here.
You see?
Alex and Dan are filling in.
No.
You let them go fishing until next Wednesday.
- Otto, I think - it's wonderful - That you're so - accommodating, - But sometimes you - just have to say no.
- I mean, - you're running a business.
Wait a second.
Is that the same dog from July?
Orientation: North Hall, two-six.
All right, it's okay.
I'll find it.
It's cool.
Is this the North Quad?
: Oh, man.
-  - Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Hey, silly, we're over here.
Malcolm.
Have you looked at these - Rorschach tests - they're calling maps?
- Yeah, they're confusing, - but do you guys - Think you can talk - a little softer?
I'm ready to cry.
They're not to scale.
- How do they expect - anyone to use - A map that's - not to scale?
Guys - Come on, this - is exciting.
- I mean, I'm so - disoriented.
Keep me away from the heavy machinery.
Where are you going?
I told you we should have taken a dry run last week!
- But, no, - "Dabney's an alarmist"!
Well, now look where we are!
Fill out both health forms and your emergency contact card.
- And feel free - to button your top.
Boys like a little mystery.
This is fun.
I don't know why we avoided this for so long.
Mine!
Mine.
Okay, so yesterday wasn't too bad.
- I didn't make - any new friends, But I did manage to avoid all my old ones.
I'll make it up to them once I'm popular.
Who am I kidding?
No, I won't.
-  - Malcolm!
Malcolm!
This is the spot - where we'll meet - for lunch, okay?
Malcolm, did you hear her?
Here you go.
Thanks.
- Hi.
I can take - over from here.
Thank you very much.
- Excuse me.
- I can't use this book.
I need to switch.
What did you do?
Nothing.
I You can't bring the book back in this condition.
No, I just got it like this.
- I don't think so.
- If you want another book, - You're going to have - to pay $40 for it.
Next.
- Mom, you have to - talk to this lady.
- She won't let me - return this book.
Oh, my God.
What did you do to your pants?
What?
Oh, for crying out loud.
How did you get a stain there already?
Mom, come on.
- It wasn't there - this morning.
Mom, stop.
It's no big deal.
No big deal?
You begged me for these pants.
- You almost started crying - in the store when - I wasn't going - to buy them - For you, and now look - what you did to them.
That looks like that's coming from the inside.
Mom, leave me alone.
You're embarrassing me.
Oh, I am not embarrassing you.
- Would you be - embarrassed by this?
No.
See?
Come on.
See if we can find some club soda and get that out.
Justice is swift.
-  - I also think we should we have - Meat loaf on Mondays - and not on Tuesdays So we can have an extra day of meat loaf sandwiches.
I also think the table should be in front of the TV and the couch should be in front of the refrigerator.
I also think - there should be hand-me-ups - instead of hand-me-downs, - I think kids - should be able to steer, And I think school should be only four hours a day and should be held on top of the building.
I also think Okay, Angela comes back tomorrow.
So she can cover for Todd on the nature hike - and, that way, Todd can - help out in the kitchen - Which will free up Sonja - to do the hayride.
That is such a good plan.
Angela's vacation is over, right?
I extended it.
It rained her first two days.
Kiss your mint.
- Okay, got to make up - some ground.
Here's what I'm going to do - Be the first freshman - with a girlfriend.
It's worth a shot, right?
I was going to give it a few weeks before asking someone out.
Wait till I liked some girl, she liked me whatever.
But I'll just move it up.
Hi.
Oh.
Hey, Stain.
What?
Hey, Stain.
Stain.
Thank you.
Hey, Stain.
Yo, Stain, what's up?
Don't pass out.
Breathe in through your nose.
You can pull this out.
Will you be my girlfriend?
How's it going?
- Look, every bulletin - is lined up perfectly With the one next to it and the one above and below.
- Thumbtacks just bring out - this side in me.
: Very nice.
- You know, it's weird being - back in high school.
- But it's kind - of fun, too.
Brings back memories.
- Yeah.
Does it?
- Yeah.
- Well!
- What have we here?
- Have you finished cleaning up - the cigarette butts On the football field?
I'll get to it.
You know, we alone determine how much we get out of any given experience.
I said, I'll get to it.
Jerkabe.
You're so bad.
Am I?
What's that look?
You're dreaming.
- Forget it.
- Don't be stupid.
- There are too many - people around.
We'd get caught for sure.
It wouldn't be fun.
It wouldn't be comfortable.
There's no good place.
This utility closet will be locked for sure.
There's no room for two people in here.
Papa loves mambo Mama loves mambo Look good and sway with it Gettin' so gay with it Shoutin' olÃ© with it.
Wow!
Papa loves mambo Mama loves mambo Papa does great with it Swings like a gate with it He loses weight with it now!
Hey, Malcolm.
I'm the fool!
- I'm the one who thought - there was such a thing As kindness and decency in life!
Okay.
Mr. Herkabe!
- Mr. Herkabe, - uh, listen, uh, I've spent the last half hour thinking, and, uh, now that I've had a chance to cool off, I-I just wanted to apologize for earlier.
Oh?
Yeah.
I mean, you were just doing your job.
Well, your apology is noted and not accepted.
What?
!
- Come on, I said - I was sorry.
Well, it's a little late for that.
You're hereby expelled from the program!
What?
!
Remove yourself - from school property - immediately.
Good day, sir.
It's just so exciting to be part of something from the very beginning.
Stain.
It's classic.
It's one of those rare nicknames - that will stick - with a person forever Because they are so perfect in their cruelty.
- Hey, you know what's weird?
- It's actually - Wiping out my memory - of your old name.
Is it Monty?
Marco?
Murgatroyd?
Oh, that pompous little martinet!
- You should have - seen his face!
- Hal, it's crazy to - be upset by this.
- You didn't want - to do it anyway.
He didn't know that!
- That means - he thinks he won.
- Which means - I think I lost!
But not for long, Lois.
Ho-ho, not for long!
: I want it delivered at 3:00.
I don't mean on the truck at 3:00.
I mean here at 3:00.
Not 3:05.
Not 3:10.
3:00.
Good.
My son will sign for it.
Hi.
You called for a massage?
Oh, yeah, yeah, come on in.
Just set up right there.
This is so great.
I hope you're good with lower back pain.
Uh, yeah.
Absolutely.
I specialize in vertebrae sciatic impactions of the back.
- Oh, that - sounds perfect!
Happy anniversary, honey.
- I'm going to be - in the salon.
Take your time.
Face up or face down?
- Why, what are you - going to do to me?
The massage.
Oh, yeah.
Oh oh, there it is!
Ah, yeah, baby.
Oh  Oh!
That's the sign of a good massage.
Oh!
That means I'm totally relaxed.
We don't mean to inflict ourselves on you, but there's no other places.
Look, we know you've had a rough couple of days, - but things are about - to get better.
We joined the chess club.
They love geniuses!
I was voted king.
I'm the queen Which is actually the more powerful position.
- And they're excited - to meet you, too.
I told them your opinion on the Luzhin defense.
It raised a few eyebrows, but you're as good as in.
I don't deserve you guys.
I'm sorry I ignored you, and I appreciate the gesture, but you're really better off without me.
Oh, come on.
- Will you get off - this sulking thing?
Since when do you care - what other people - think of you?
Cynthia, don't do this.
- Malcolm, you - hate everyone.
To you, everyone's either a moron or a creep or a poseur.
Why do you suddenly care about their opinion of you?
Because I'm shallow, okay?
I want them to like me.
It's not so bad, Malcolm.
It's only the first week.
You have, like, four years of high school left.
It's okay.
- I spent three years - being a Krelboyne.
- I can spend four years - being a joke.
- Malcolm, you're - not a joke.
Hey, Stainalator!
Bruce Spring-stain.
What are you doing?
Mopping.
In five minutes, I will have my two hours, - and that will discharge - my obligation To the volunteer program.
Oh, no, it does not, because you have been expelled.
All I know is I've been mopping!
And this floor looks pretty darn clean to me.
But that was unauthorized mopping.
It is spotless, and maybe we should just see whether the principal thinks it's a job well done.
It's not even clean.
Don't you dare!
No!
Now let's see if you're     I'd just like to say in my defense he started it.
- Ah, Francis, - there you are.
- Oh, look at you - tidying up.
Otto, we have to talk.
We will talk tomorrow.
- Come, I want to - show you something.
No!
Tomorrow I may be leading aerobics again or faking my way through a wine-tasting seminar or-or playing the prostitute in the Old West stunt show.
That was you!
The way you run this place, sometimes it's not being nice.
It's-it's being careless and foolish.
Look.
Yes, it's a truck.
Look, Otto, I don't want to leave you high and It is your truck.
What?
- I saw it - I thought of you.
Your car blew up, yeah?
I thought this would be a good thing for you.
You see, this is what I'm talking about.
You are the best boss ever!
I wish I could tell you to take a few days and drive it someplace nice, - but we're - a little shorthanded.
- I understand, - believe me.
-  - Just kidding!
Go.
Take a week.
Have fun.
Malcolm!
Malcolm, hey, come to the "Y" with me.
I think a good yoga class would really help center you.
A-And there are boys.
- Mom's here!
- What?
- Dad got in trouble.
- Mom is freaking out.
- Whatever you do, - stay out of her way.
Oh, my God.
I know what I'm going to do.
What are you talking about?
I'm going get sent to military school.
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
What are you doing?
My dad has a hide-a-key.
Here we go.
- I don't want - to be a stickler, But you don't have the right decal for this lot.
Malcolm, stop this.
- You don't have - a license.
That's okay.
I'm just going to crash into my mom's car.
This is crazy, Malcolm!
- This is the - stupidest thing I've ever heard.
No, it's not, it's smart.
I just take this car and crash it into that car.
- Then I'll be in military school - just like Francis was.
It'll be paradise.
Somebody with feet stop him!
For the love of God, - your shirttail's stuck - in the door!
Take me with you!
- What's going on?
- I don't know, man.
Stop!
I won't let you do this!
- I would rather die - than be left alone with Mom!
Get out of the way!
No!
You can run me over.
I don't care!
-  -  Malcolm!
If you do this, I will never have sex with you again.
Again?
- They had sex?
- He had sex with her?
That kid had sex?
-  - She's a slut.
-  - She's a big slut.
-  - Oh, my God, - What a slut.
Wow, I could really learn a lesson from this, - but all I can think about - right now Is how the whole school is convinced that I had se - You get out of that car - this instant!
- What the heck is - wrong with you?
!
Here, take my pancakes.
Oh, and I did your laundry.
I folded them warm so they wouldn't wrinkle.
Reese, I'm not going to tell you about it.
It didn't even happen.
Okay.
Where didn't it happen?
- Son, I know - it's been tough for you Spending all your time by yourself after school.
I've been trying to adjust.
- Well, guess what.
- You don't have to anymore.
That's all over now.
- I rearranged - my schedule - So I can get - home earlier.
Isn't that great?
We're going to spend a lot more time together.
What do you say, - this weekend, you help me - clean out the garage?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hal, you've been out here for six hours.
- That's all you're - throwing away?
No.
This is my "maybe" pile.
Look, I want to able to fit the van in the garage.
- That's the whole point - of having a garage!
You don't realize how complicated this is.
- Hal.
- Lois, I promise you.
The van will fit in the garage!
I think you owe me an apology.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now - You're not - the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Francis is home visiting with his wife, Piama.
- It's been so nice around here - since they came.
Good dinner, Mom.
- Please.
It's completely - overcooked.
You must really be hurting for some decent cooking.
See?
Mom's so busy being mean to Piama, she doesn't even notice us.
We've been getting away with murder.
Hello?
Uh, hi, Claire.
: It's my sister!
Oh, God.
I'm gonna hang up on her.
- No, Hal.
Find out - what she wants.
So what's up?
Uh-huh.
- Family reunion this weekend - for my Dad's birthday.
I'm sorry, Claire, but I'm having foot surgery, so we'll have to pass.
No, Hal, it's been too long already, we should go.
- But you know what, - my foot feels fine now.
- So, I'm going to cancel - that surgery - And we'll see you Saturday.
- Wait a minute.
- They're inviting us - only two days before - We have to be there?
- Forget it, Hal.
They don't want us there.
But you can never be too careful with feet.
Which is exactly why we should go.
What am I thinking?
I've already had foot surgery.
Okay, so we'll see you Saturday.
So what's Grandpa like?
He's okay, but the rest of Dad's family treat Mom like crap; they're jerks.
Rich jerks, and Grandpa's the richest of them all.
- And he loves kids; - just say and do What I tell you, and we'll be set for life.
You're nuts.
Look, it's too late for you and me, - but Dewey's still young - and adorable.
- Although we do have - a narrow window to work with.
In a year, you're gonna look like a freak.
Sorry it's so cramped, Piama.
- This van really isn't designed - to carry seven people.
Oh.
I guess I was thrown off by the seven seats and the seven seat belts.
- Uh, Francis, how's that - ranch job treating you?
Oh, great.
Never a dull moment.
In fact, last week I got to castrate a bull calf.
What does castrate mean?
Ask your mother.
You know, I have always wanted to know - how to castrate - a bull calf.
Tell me about it.
- Well, it's - fascinating stuff.
- We use this tool - called a burdizzo - It looks like - a giant pair of pliers - And the calf has - to be restrained - So that it - doesn't kick so once you cut off their blood supply, they shrivel up and are replaced by fat tissue.
What a great story, Francis.
It really made the last hour and a half fly by.
Here come the clones.
Hal, be nice.
Hey, there's my kid brother!
Hi, Claire.
Hello, Tom.
Hal, that shirt looks fabulous on you.
- Honey, isn't he - looking handsome?
He certainly is.
- : - Lois.
Hey!
- Who's this?
- Your cousin Pete.
Pete-O!
What's this?
- Your dad's birthday present; - we all chipped in.
We?
We're going to chip in, too.
- Oh, don't worry, - we'll put your name on the card.
Eh, come on.
Let's get you inside.
You must be worn out from that drive.
- Actually, it - wasn't so bad.
Nonsense.
Look at those sweat stains on Lois.
Wow.
It figures this is the side of the family we never see.
Meanwhile, the grandma who goes shopping in her bra visits five times a year.
We can leave right now.
- Just get in the car - and drive.
Sandusky Caverns is just - Hal, relax.
- We can do this.
I can't help it.
I work myself into knots - whenever I have to face - the grand patriarch.
Hi, Dad!
Hal, you made it!
Anybody help an old man out of the pool?
I got you, Grandpa.
Aah, right.
Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
- What do you think - that guy's for?
His name is Francis.
If you kill him, you don't get another one.
Welcome one and all!
Hey.
Lois.
Dewey!
Goodness, you've grown!
I bet you don't even remember me.
Yes, I do.
You thang to me when I wath thweeping.
You remember that?
!
Why, that's adorable!
So good to see you, Dad.
I have to admit, I was a little nervous about coming back here after so much time had gone by.
I was expecting Expecting car trouble?
Because it looks like you packed a spare tire!
Ah, Malcolm!
I understand they finally figured out you're a genius.
What's your favorite subject in school?
I don't know.
History.
History, is it?
What do you think about the Civil War?
- I guess it's kind - of interesting.
Ooh.
Have I got something to show you!
- There you two are!
-  Hi, Amelia.
This reunion is going to be the death of me.
- Feeding this many - people every day.
- Keeping track - of all the kids.
- I swear I had to run the croquet - tournament on Thursday All by myself.
- Tomorrow we've got - a pancake breakfast, A family photo at 3:00, a birthday dinner at 5:00 and gifts at 6:00, all with no one to take charge but me.
- This is what - General Schwarzkopf Must have felt like during Desert Storm!
Lois, no one else is wearing a name tag.
Hal, it's fine.
Hey, untie his hands and give him his pants back!
You're the only grandkid I've let in here.
These are my most precious possessions.
Cool.
Oh, never mind that stuff.
You don't want to waste your time with a bunch of guns.
Take a look at this quartermasters' ledger books.
This is where the war was really won.
Take a look at this.
Notice anything?
Oh, yeah.
The numbers don't add up here.
Ah.
What?
In that column.
The numbers add up to 1,286 but the total at the bottom says 1,179.
I was just hoping you'd notice how the S's look like F's but this is incredible.
I think this quartermaster was skimming rifles.
This is the kind of thing that gets your name in the Civil War Quarterly.
Good job, Malcolm!
: Let's see what else this guy was up to!
I would never be massaged by a woman.
I mean, you need that strength.
When my body's in need, I want a man to really get in there.
Okay, just one more lap.
Boy, those kids have really taken a shine to Francis.
He's not ready for kids, Piama; don't rush him.
More cake, Lois?
Oh, no, thank you.
Ah, don't be shy.
- I saw the way you scarfed - down your first piece.
Oh, I'm sorry, you're probably on a diet, aren't you?
Dad?
Have you seen the cookies?
We have to talk.
It's about Lois.
Ever since we got here, the family's taken every opportunity to  Dad, don't do the face.
What face?
No, you know the face!
Don't do that, I'm serious.
: Oh.
Can I do the voice?
Dad, I'm not kidding.
: Then why are you laughing?
Dad!
Nothing funny heeere.
No, sireeeeee!
Okay, you want a story, here's a story.
It's called "The Kids Who Couldn't Play By Themselves".
We did some good work today.
Tomorrow, we'll hit Grandpa with the "Good Ship Lollipop" number right after breakfast.
I want to swim in the pool.
You can swim in the pool when we own the pool.
- Nice angle you're working - with Grandpa, Malcolm.
- I have to admit, you're getting - a lot of face time - But when he croaks, - all he's gonna leave you Is that stupid Civil War crap.
Reese You can have it, but I want it out of the house.
- Back off Grandpa.
- He's ours.
What?
We've been working this guy for three years, and we're not about to let you waltz in here - and snake him out - from under us.
What are you saying?
It's a big house; accidents happen.
- And then the little boy, - about your age, Was found hanging in the moonlight, strangled by his own intestines.
And there was just enough life left in him to say "You're next!
"!
Come out!
He was lying; it was just a story.
All I want is two seconds of honest, human conversation with my own father.
I mean, what is so awful about me that he has to distance himself with jokes and silly faces?
Hal, you're not going to make any progress if you keep personalizing other people's problems.
We've talked about this.
You just don't get it.
- How could you?
You don't - have any father issues.
I'm blessed.
- There's got to be some way - to break this cycle.
Some way to make my dad let his guard down and engage me on an emotional level Are you even listening?
Sorry.
Oh!
Hal, the answer to this is simple.
- You just have to - look at your life; - Look at what you've - accomplished.
You have a good relationship with your sons.
They can talk to you about anything.
You have a wife and home and family a lot of people would envy.
You're past this.
You think?
Yes, I do.
Hal, you're all grown up.
Uh-oh.
What?
I I wet the bed.
- Oh, that tears it, - Lois.
- You know I've been - telling myself that - Everything's okay, But my bladder knew different.
- I am not leaving here until - I've had this out with my dad.
- Hal, are you sure - you want to do this?
Lois, he just sits by - while everyone treats - you like a dog, When they're not treating you like a servant.
It's not that bad.
Did you notice last night - when you gave Helen - your chair And she flipped the cushion over before she sat down?
No.
- Why are we staring - at a mall, Grandpa?
- This is a battlefield, - Private, And I'm not your Grandpa.
- I'm Captain Atticus - P. Featherton, Commander of the Company "A" cavalry.
It's 1864.
- Cannonballs - are flying overhead.
The nostrils curl with the smell of burning flesh.
Can I get a yogurt?
- You're ravaged by dysentery, - you don't want a yogurt.
-  - Edith, where are my keys?
- They're supposed to be - in the key thingy.
- I can't trust you - with anything.
- Now, there's - Confederate sharpshooters On that ridge over there.
We have to sit very still while we wait for our orders - or they'll pick us off - one by one.
But Very still, Private.
More still than that!
Isn't this great?
- I asked for these - to be ironed.
What is wrong with you people?
Nice touch with the backwards "E".
You've got a real gift for this butt kissing stuff.
We are so in.
What do you mean "we"?
- Ma, you got to let us - hide in here; these kids What's wrong?
- Oh, I forgot to pack - my good shoes.
- I can't believe it.
- What am I supposed to do?
All I've got are my sneakers.
- I'm supposed to take them off - and run around barefoot - Like a hillbilly - in front of these people?
- Mom, it's just shoes.
- Relax.
- Oh, Francis, - it's not just shoes.
- You have no idea - what it's like - Trying to please - someone else's family And always coming up short.
- And would it kill you - to dress up a little For a family picture?
Oh, hey, Hal.
You know, that Malcolm of yours - doesn't handle the heat - very well.
Dad, we need to talk.
This is serious.
Then I better put on my serious face.
No, Dad, no faces.
Unless we deal with this, you and I will never have a meaningful relationship.
Our relationship is fine.
No, it's not fine.
There's a big piece missing.
Oh, sure we laugh, we-we have fun, but that's all we do.
- We just skim along - the surface Without talking about anything important.
Do you understand?
Let's ask Mr. Tickles.
Remember, Mr. Tickles?
No, Dad, I mean it!
- : - Well, Mr. Tickles means it, too.
We used to do this all the time when you were a kid.
You loved Mr. Tickles.
Ooh, it's almost picture time.
Hey, this was fun, Hal.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
: Oh!
That's not where we keep the liquor.
- I'm not looking - for liquor.
I'm looking for shoes.
- For some reason, - I forgot to pack - My good shoes - And now I have nothing to wear - with this dress - That I rushed out to buy so I - would look nice for this family That thinks I can't do anything right.
You know what?
I have some extra shoes in the back of our car.
I bet they might fit you.
Really?
It's the black Jaguar parked out by the gate.
It's unlocked.
Thank you.
Really.
Don't you guys want to be with your parents?
My socks are itchy.
Malcolm, I hear your sock itchiness - and I'm glad you're - telling me about it.
- You boys should know - that I am here for you - Anytime you want - to talk about anything.
After we get this picture taken, - I'm going to spend - some time with each of you Because I am involved and into everything - that's going on - with this family.
Where's your mother?
-  - Amelia?
- There aren't any shoes - in your car.
Are you sure?
Okay, everybody, big smiles.
- Cheese on three.
- One, two Three.
Cheese!
- Okay, let me get - one more real quick.
Excellent.
Thank you, everybody.
You weren't in the photo, Lois?
Well, I guess we can try to take another one.
You know, if we can regather everybody.
And if we can get the photographer back.
And talk to the caterers to see if they can hold off on dinner.
Lois, where were you?
Honey?
Honey?
Honey  God.
Hey, is Lois going to help with the salad?
Oh, God.
More drama from that woman.
- What are you - going to do?
We don't know.
We never know.
Hal what are you doing?
Taking a stand for my dignity.
- You've driven me - to this, Dad.
My wife is upstairs crying - because of the way - this family treats her And it's got to stop.
- : - Uh-oh.
Someone's a Gloomy Gus.
You never face up to any real problems, do you?
You just think if you make enough jokes, they'll all go away.
Don't you see that through my entire life, - you've avoided - dealing with me - Whenever I was going - through a tough time?
- Really, this is - beyond the pale.
You never helped me when my girlfriend dumped me  when my dog died Hey.
- When my best friend - moved away - When I got beaten up - at school - When I spent - a whole summer crying And I didn't know why!
: Hal, stop it!
- And you haven't helped me - while my family has been Habitually tormenting my wife to the point where I've had to avoid both them and you!
I haven't had a father for the past 15 years because you won't deal with anything!
Okay, that's off my chest.
I hope you heard it.
I love you, Dad.
I'll go get you a towel.
One of the old ones, please.
All right, everybody ready?
I was born ready.
The cake!
- The cake!
- The cart!
We had to get out of there pretty fast for our own safety.
It was unbelievable.
We drove three blocks before Aunt Claire let go of the door handle.
I am so very disappointed in all of you.
- I don't care - what those people did, That was no way for you to behave.
Right, Hal?
- Yeah, you boys - are on notice.
If you ever drive a golf cart over a catered dinner - and into a - swimming pool again, There will be consequences.
Dire consequences.
I guess we just kissed off a six-figure trust fund.
I told Grandpa you tied me to the golf cart.
What?
!
He still likes you.
- Nice, we're back - in the game.
Yeah.
Oh, Piama.
Is that too much air on you?
No.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
What?
What?
- Okay, I ate the - cupcakes you baked - For Dewey's class - last night.
And I took Dad's license to make a fake I.D. - And I can't return - your necklace Because I already sold it.
I was just going to say your shirt didn't go with your pants.
Oh.
Phew!
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
- Would you like some more - orange juice, Stevie?
Thank you Lois.
- Stevie's staying at our house - for a week - While his parents are - in Hawaii.
- They get tropical drinks - on a beach While he gets to watch my dad air-drying in the kitchen.
Did everyone notice the way Stevie pre-sliced the grapefruit sections?
- It's so nice to have - a boy in the house - Who's not - a rude little monster.
Hey, was that shot at me?
Yes, honey, it was.
- Hal, I don't have any bread - for Dewey's sandwich.
- You're gonna have to stop by the - market on your way to school.
No problem.
- Or you could - just give me Money for a hot lunch.
Don't be silly.
Those things aren't nutritious.
Why are we in a liquor store?
- For the bread.
- Everybody knows - Liquor stores have - the best bread in town - : Ten lottery - tickets, please.
-  - I don't see any bread.
- What are you talking about?
- There's melba toast.
- If you can't make a - sandwich out of that, - You're just not - trying hard enough.
Oh, my God.
What?
Dewey, I just won a thousand dollars!
A thousand dollars!
Yes!
What are we going to buy?
We're not going to buy anything with this, son.
We're going to put this money right into your college fund.
A secret college fund that your mother can never know about.
Sometimes when it rains, they get stuck.
Here.
Thanks.
Uh, Malcolm, right?
- Yeah, and I know - you're Alison.
I'm glad we finally talked - after a month of - being locker neighbors.
"Locker neighbors"?
Yeah, we're This is my locker.
Oh!
You locker neigh - 'cause-'cause we're - right next door.
Yeah, that-that's funny.
I-I get it.
Well, uh, see you, neighbor.
And keep your damn dog off my lawn!
I-I don't have a dog.
No, no, I was kidding, because we're neighbors and sometimes neighbors have - a problem with - their dogs going See, I always assume people know when I'm kidding, - but sometimes it's - just so subtle - I come off sounding - like a jerk.
- I mean, not too - subtle for you.
I don't want to sound condescending.
- It's just I think about - this kind of stuff a lot.
And I should have stopped talking 30 seconds ago, right?
Uh, I have to go to gym now.
What is wrong with me?
How long you got?
- I always ruin - everything.
- Even with a perfect - girl like Alison.
Alison's a moron.
She's not the problem.
- It's me.
- I overthink everything.
I can't even carry on a normal conversation without screwing it up.
Why won't my brain just let me be happy?
- Honey, I got - to get going.
- You heading down - to the art gallery?
It's not art!
- Sorry.
Heading down - to the place Where you sell overpriced, pretentious stuff - to tourists with more money - than taste?
You do listen.
-  - Thank you very much.
It was good doing business with you, Mr. Dodson.
- Ah, Francis, come.
- Meet Mr. Dodson.
He is a wonderful man.
We will be doing lots of business with him for sure.
Yeah, look, I got to go.
- Uh, I'm running late - for another sales call, - So, uh, see you - gentlemen around.
We will talk soon.
Ah, Francis.
I am such a lucky man.
- When I left for - this country, All of my friends are warning me, "Otto, Otto, be careful.
People will try to take advantage of you".
But this is not the case.
Like that Mr. Dodson.
He knows so much more about ranching than I do.
But does he act all superior and high and mighty?
No!
No!
Instead, he teaches me.
Like before today, I did not know that cows need ultraviolet protection.
What?
What is this stuff?
Sunscreen.
For cows.
- Otto, how much did you pay - for this?
- $200 a bucket, - plus, of course The zinc for their noses.
Do not worry.
I already paid him.
How much time do I get for a thousand bucks?
Oh, Mama!
I have been dreaming about this for years.
What?
Are you crazy?
We can't do it at my house.
My family's there.
Uh, but there's a parking lot near my office where we can meet.
- That's your ground - speed indicator And that's your vibration tachometer.
Check.
- : - Yes, sir!
Can't wait to resurface some roads with this baby.
Wow, looks like you're all set.
Yes.
Let me ask you a hypothetical.
I mean, if I was to accidentally run over something I mean crush it into dust where they're completely unrecognizable You'd want to center it in the middle of the drum.
That is, if such a tragic incident should occur.
Come again?
Look, a lot of our, uh, "road builders" have that inevitable fragile item cross their paths.
And if I were to encounter such a fragile item?
- You'd have no choice - but to speed up Until that item no longer posed a threat to your road building.
Now sign here, and you can get to work.
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
I can do better.
Stevie, you are such an angel.
- You are welcome to stay with us - any time your parents go away.
Sure, Hawaii's great, - but we're having fun - right here, huh?
Sure are.
Hey!
I didn't buy this.
With lotion.
Ooh!
- Don't you have midterms - to study for, too?
I think I have three tomorrow.
- Don't you even care - that if you don't study, You're going to fail.
Nah.
How do you do that?
What?
How do you go through your life - without worrying that bad things - are going to happen?
I don't know.
- I guess if I feel myself - starting to worry, I just sing the Minty-Mint song in my head.
They're cool, they're fresh, they'll clean your breath Minty-Mints are your breath's friend.
So, when I just asked you that question about failing, - you were thinking about - that song?
- Yep.
-  Boys, for - The last time, Get in here, and help me with these groceries now!
Minty-Mints are your breath's friend.
Reese, you're a genius.
- What?
- That girl, Alison, - Just asked me Why everyone in the world has accents except for us.
And instead of going into this long explanation, - I thought of the - Minty-Mint song.
- And all that came - out of my mouth was, - "Because they're weird," - and she liked it.
Cool.
I could actually feel my brain click off.
She said I was cute, and then she touched my shoulder.
Let's keep this in the family, understand?
Hey, here she comes.
- Oh, man.
- I just did it once.
- What if it was - all just a fluke?
- You'll be fine.
- I'm too new at this.
- Just relax.
- But Just say what I say.
Hey, Malcolm.
I-I forgot to ask you something.
Hmm Are you okay?
Do you need to get to class or something?
No, I'm just killing time till lunch.
Oh, I know what you mean.
These mornings can just drag on.
School's for suckers.
It's just some scam thought up by parents so they can stay home all day and party hearty.
Oh, my God.
I've thought the same thing.
I, uh I think it'd be cool if they took the one-dollar bill and changed it to the million-dollar bill.
That way, nobody would be poor, and we'd all be millionaires.
That is such a cool idea.
- I want to help - poor people, too.
What I wanted to ask you is, um, do you want to go to the dance with me on Friday?
Yeah!
I was waiting to ask you, - but I wanted to find - the right time, and the  Uh, awesome.
Awesome.
I I got to get to class.
Me, too.
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
"College fund"?
Dewey!
Hi.
What brings you out on such a lovely day?
I was following my dad on his secret steamroller.
- Oh, it's not just - a steamroller, son.
This is a culmination of everything I've worked for in my entire life.
And I've also managed to put away some money for your college.
- Which, if interest rates - hold Oh, all right!
If you don't tell your mother, I'll let you squash something.
Can I squash Reese's bike?
Sure.
It's in the trunk.
You want to know what's great?
Not thinking so much.
It's cool.
- Usually I'd be all stressed out - like Stevie.
But I figure life should be What's the word?
Funner.
What'd you get for problem 17?
I drew a tank.
What's wrong with you?
Huh?
For two days, you've been acting like an idiot.
No.
For two days, I've acted like someone who's happy and relaxed.
You're turning into Reese.
- So?
I'm not stressing - out about school And girls and stuff.
- That doesn't make me - an idiot.
- That makes me - the opposite of an idiot.
The brain is a muscle.
Use it or lose it.
- But maybe if you - use it too much, It'll cramp up on you.
- Didn't think about - that, did you?
Malcolm?
- : - I fell.
- Who do you think - invented the spoon?
Paleo Spoony Spoonicus.
Spoony Spoonicus.
That is so awesome.
- : You're supposed - to take me ice-skating today.
Where were you?
- I'm sorry, Dewey.
- I got stuck at the office.
- So, Hal, I called - the office today - And they said you took - the whole day off.
That's right.
- I spent the whole day - ice-skating with Dewey.
- Oh, you should see the boy, - Lois.
Twirling and jumping on that ice.
He did a double axel - that was, quite frankly, - exquisite.
Hal, we've got to go over next month's budget tonight.
Oh, I can't tonight, honey.
- I have to go into the office - to make up for the time I missed with Dewey.
Yeah, the office.
Can't get enough of the good ol' office.
Hello?
- Malcolm, good, you're home.
- Listen.
- Is there some scientific way - to find out - If something is pudding - without actually tasting it?
Is it chocolate?
- No.
Why, would that make - a difference?
I like chocolate.
- It's browner than - the not-chocolate stuff.
You didn't by any chance find that coffee can in the garage, did you?
- You're going - to the steamroller, Aren't you?
So what if I am?
I rented it.
- Why shouldn't I get to use it?
- It's a free country.
- Dad, you've been crushing things - for five days straight.
Have you even slept?
That's the thing, Dewey.
- Ever since I got - the steamroller, I don't have to sleep.
- It's like the laws of - nature don't apply to me.
What's this?
Nothing.
It's a brochure for a wrecking ball.
It's not even mine, okay?
I'm just holding it for a friend.
Dad, I think you have a problem.
Why can't everyone just leave me alone?
!
- Check out - this awesome story.
- So I thought - I was going - To borrow Reese's - tuxedo T-shirt For the dance tonight, but then I saw one at the mall that said, "FBI Federal Booby Inspector".
Federal Booby Inspector!
Awesome.
You the man.
Malcolm, I know I promised you the tuxedo shirt, but I saw this at the mall, and I think it's way better.
Oh, my God!
- I was going to buy this - after school!
- No way!
- Righteous!
Whoa.
Stevie, you got to let Reese head-butt you.
- It's like getting hit - in the head With something really hard.
Not in this lifetime.
Your call.
- Maybe we'll do one later - at the dance.
Go with you?
Ha ha ha.
Come on, Stevie.
You got to come with us.
We're like the Three Musketeers.
- You can't have - the Three Musketeers without What's his name.
- Nougat.
- Yeah, that dude.
I'll be quilting.
Fabrizzi's a master.
- The desert - is practically alive.
It looks like the dolphin and the tiger are dancing.
Could I get this picture but with my husband's face where the dolphin is?
- Well, like all - great artists, He'll do absolutely anything for money.
Oh, my God!
Francis, what happened?
You are going to be so proud of me.
- I was putting gas - in the van, And this guy walked out of the men's room.
The sunscreen guy!
And when I saw, - it was like I became - this wild animal.
Like nature took over.
I ran up to him and I blindsided him - with the windshield-wiper - squeegee, And his Big Gulp went flying - and he was crying - for his mother!
- Do you want - to see his front tooth?
- You know what?
- I'm going to think about it And maybe come back another time.
Why are you whistling?
Honey, listen.
- I really want to - hear about this, But I kind of told my boss I'm not trailer trash, - and you're blowing - my cover.
These little cuts and bruises?
These here are the symbols of my success.
- I mean, the guy took - some convincing, But in the end, the money was cheerfully refunded.
Is there supposed to be this much blood in my pocket?
- Okay, you're going - to the emergency room.
Want some punch?
- If I say yes, - you're just going to hit me.
- I'm going - to hit you anyway, But it's funnier if you say yes first.
- So what do you - like better, Slow dancing or fast dancing?
Slow dancing.
Me, too.
Unless the fast dance song, like, really rocks.
Yeah.
I can't believe the awesomeness of how awesome this is.
At Cheswick Grounds, Britain's largest public lawn, each blade of grass is said to grow a full centimeter a day.
Let's watch.
Stevie, what are you doing here?
- I thought you're going - to the dance with the boys.
I didn't want to go.
Stevie, you listen to me.
- Just because you're in - a wheelchair - Doesn't mean you can't - enjoy a dance like anyone else.
- I think you are a fine young man - with beautiful qualities That any girl would enjoy - if you just put yourself - out there.
- But - There are plenty - Of things you can do.
- You can snap your fingers - to the beat.
- You can spin around - in a circle.
That would be adorable.
- Please - Stevie, any girl would be lucky To be your girlfriend.
- You're polite, - you're considerate, And you are very clean.
Girls go crazy for that.
- Lois - Stevie, you know what?
We're going to that dance.
Francis, what happened to you?
Otto, I have to tell you something.
There is no such thing as sunscreen for cows.
- What are you - talking about?
- The guy, he was - ripping you off.
But don't worry, I took care of it.
I got you your money back.
Ugh!
I am such an idiot.
It is my fault you had to fight.
I'm sorry.
And thank you.
It's okay.
You know what?
- There is a man - in my office right now, And I am suspicious of him, too.
Come, you will meet him.
Okay, show my friend here what you are selling me.
This here's a magic stick.
It finds water.
Oh, yeah.
I've seen these.
It's got the good Swenson bevel on there.
Yeah, these are great.
I don't know.
- I guess I'd say - I like curly fries better.
Ha, I knew it.
- You totally owe me - a buck, Malcolm.
What about Cajun curly fries?
Oh, my God!
- I completely forgot - about those.
Those are my favorite.
Mine, too.
Why can't they make more foods curly?
You guys are, like, the coolest brothers.
I mean, you're both so easy to talk to.
It's not like a strain or anything.
- Yeah, Reese and I get along - awesome.
- It's 'cause - you're so alike.
- You should totally check - to make sure - You're not, like, twins - or something.
- I'll ask my mom - when I get home.
- I just got - a really good idea.
- I know this senior - who's got some beer stashed.
No way.
- We can grab a six pack - and a blanket - And go down - to the football field.
Awesome.
I can't believe I'm about to do this.
- Underage drinking, - making out with a girl - Where we're almost - certain to get caught.
High school rules!
I am Hal!
Oh maybe just one row.
Get away from here, son!
I don't want you to see me like this!
Dad, you have to stop!
I can't!
I'm proud of you, Dad.
So what yard line do you want to sit on?
- 'Cause I was - thinking the 50.
- But it's kind - of a long walk.
- There's nothing to be nervous - about, Stevie.
I'll dance the first couple of dances with you.
Hey, stop blaming yourself!
That guy's a complete jerk.
We're going to throw away his beer, get someone to take you home, and you should totally dump that guy.
That's what I would have done - if I hadn't shut off my brain - all week.
Here's what I really did.
Minty Mints are your breath's friend.
My mom said you asked for this.
How's my gal?
- I don't know.
- She won't stop screaming.
- She hasn't even seen - my report card yet.
The way I figure it, - I have to average - an 8.0 just to break even.
Which might be doable since I don't have distractions anymore.
Alison dumped me as soon as I used the word "paradox" in a sentence.
Welcome back.
Sorry about Alison.
It's no big deal.
I'm still going to be seeing her around a lot.
You know what I don't get about football?
How come the away team has so many different uniforms?
I don't know.
Rich kids.
Probably it.
You want to make out?
Do you?
Sure.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
- WOMAN : - And what do you think, Scott?
Give Reese a slice from the fuzzy side, and I didn't see a thing.
Deal.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
That laptop is so sweet.
- I can't believe - you're already upgrading it.
Are you sure your dad will sell it to me for 300 bucks?
Minus my ten percent.
Six months of tutoring kids who won't even take off their football helmets.
Once I get - my birthday money, - I'll have it.
You keep your money in a book?
Yeah.
- It's the one place no one - in my family will ever look.
- Have you seen your brother?
- He was supposed to  You stupid kid.
-  - You gave me A black eye, you jerk!
You're going to pay for this.
No one is paying for anything.
You are going to drop this.
Ow!
I'm sick of you two fighting, - and you at least should - know better.
Your birthday is coming up.
I only want money.
If you want anything, you will not retaliate.
I don't care who started it.
It ends with you.
- But he - With you!
- You're just going to let him - have the last licks?
Yes, I am.
Now, get out of my sight, both of you.
Well handled.
Fighting like that right in front of me.
What could possibly have possessed those two boys?
Help me!
Help me.
Oh, I'll help you.
Hello, there.
Hello.
It's my son's birthday, - and I wanted - to buy him a comic book.
He only wanted money, but he really loves this stuff - and it just doesn't seem - like a birthday If there's nothing to open.
Do you work here?
I have the conn.
Oh, great.
So, uh, do you have any suggestions?
You know, something nice, like, $20?
Well, if you're looking for a $20 comic book, you're in the league for Mr. Incredible.
- I don't think - he's ready for that.
And for only $20?
- Have you lost your mind?
- Hey!
- You guys shut up.
- No.
Tell me about him.
Oh, well, he's incredible.
He's a rock star by day and superhero by night.
He can shoot flames out of his eyes and melt his enemy's brains with his mind.
Yeah.
I think I read that one.
Sir, there is no Mr. Incredible.
Well, then-then, why Sir, the Middle Earthling is for clientele - sophisticated enough - to appreciate Cinematic drawing and nonlinear storytelling.
And I can see by your office drone shirt that you're not a serious graphic novel collector.
Is the new Metamorpho in?
- Yes, Ricky, right away.
- Well, wait.
- Hey, I was - Excuse me I'm helping a customer.
Is that for my costume?
What costume?
The school play.
I'm in the school play!
Oh, right.
You're a tree?
I'm Abraham Lincoln!
I'm reciting the Gettysburg Address.
Why do always do this to me?
Oh, calm down.
- I always pull it together, - don't I?
- Remember that great - Frankenstein costume I made That everybody loved?
Yeah.
Can we use that again?
- Hey, Otto, I think we have - some vandals or something.
There's more fences down, and this time some chickens were killed.
- It almost looks like they - were stomped to death.
La vaca diablo ha regresado.
It was only the wind.
But the chickens look like they exploded.
- Well, obviously, - the broken fences flew - To the other side - of the ranch, Hitting the chickens in a slamming motion and dragging them across the ground in a manner that closely resembles stomping.
You see, there is a perfectly logical explanation for everything.
Â¡La vaca diablo!
Fue asi la vaca diablo!
Perfectly logical.
- Was he saying - "Devil cow"?
Ah, it is a silly legend.
Many years ago they say there was a cow who one day tasted human flesh and went bad.
And now whenever the moon is red, she comes down from a mountain lair to drink the blood of the innocent.
You're talking about a cow.
- Yeah, I know.
- Silly, isn't it?
Oh Wake up.
What do you want?
I just want to let you know you're not getting last licks.
- Huh?
- I'm sick of you always - Having an edge - just 'cause you're an idiot - And I'm smart and understand - about consequences.
I can be just as vicious and shortsighted as you.
Oh, yeah.
I'm really scared.
Why don't you just?
What did you do?
I sunk to your level.
And I have to say it feels good.
How did comic book shopping go?
Bad.
I'm just out of my depth.
Look, we both hoped it wouldn't come to this, - but you know - what we have to do.
- Hal, we promised - ourselves we wouldn't.
What other choice do we have?
Isn't this interesting?
Once more, I'm the only person that can help you.
- I'm your best friend - when you need someone To pick up your mail or sit on a suitcase, - but when it's time - for a barbecue, - I have to watch - from the car.
I got to tell you, Hal, this beer is tasting mighty bitter.
I'll take another.
- Are you going to help me - or not?
I will help you.
- But one day - And that day may never come I will ask you to perform a service for me.
Actually, it'll be tomorrow.
- I'll be here - about 10:00, And if it's nice, wear a bathing suit.
What?
What happened?
It's horrible.
What, the rug?
That's no rug.
It's an antelope.
Oh, my God!
It's been completely flattened.
- Look.
There's pieces - in the tree.
- What could have done - something like this?
It-It was me.
- You?
- Yeah.
On-on my moped.
A-A terrible accident.
It was dark.
It jumped right in front of me.
I had perhaps a few too many Cajun martinis.
That should be a lesson to all of us, hey?
Go get a shovel and some sawdust.
Okay, hold still.
- I don't think I want - to be in this play.
- Now, I've been - doing some reading, And this Lincoln person wasn't such a great guy.
Did you know that the Emancipation Proclamation wasn't about slavery at all?
- It was strictly - a political move.
Honey, you're just nervous - 'cause you've never had a part - with lines before.
Or where you move.
For the love of God!
He suspended the writ of habeas corpus in Maryland!
- You should have seen Reese.
- It was hysterical.
Are you sure you want to push him?
- It's the only way - to get through - To his primitive - little monkey brain.
- He has to know - that I'm not going to back down.
What is this?
Oh, my God!
If you can be vicious, I can be smart.
How many copies did you make?
I don't know.
How many copies are there in a pack of 500 sheets?
This is over, Reese.
- I don't know - why you're so upset.
Look at you going like a big boy.
All right, two scoops, fudge ripple.
Now are we going to the comic book store?
- : Patience, Luke.
- You are reckless.
- We've gone to the beach, - we've gone to the movies.
I won you an animal at the church bazaar.
We've gone out for coffee, lunch, Slushees, pie.
I can't negotiate unless I'm firing on all cylinders.
Just have many cylinders do you have?
Pull over.
- No, you're right.
- I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.
Pull over.
- Craig, I am not - pulling over.
Just let me out of the car.
Craig, I am not stopping this car.
- All right, - all right!
Calm down.
- You are going - to have to learn How to get along without Craig Feldspar.
My ducky.
Hey.
Get out of here.
I'm busy.
I'll be quick.
- You know, while I was - ripping down all those flyers, - I was racking my brain - trying to come up - With some way - to get back at you.
And I began to wonder.
What's the point?
No matter how hard I try, nothing ever stops you.
Maybe you're just better at this than I am.
- Well, yeah.
- Then again, - Maybe we should ask your friends - what they think.
What?
Your friends.
- These are friends, - aren't they?
You're always hanging out with them or near them anyway.
Hey, do any of you know this kid's name?
This kid right here.
Do any of you know his name?
But he's always following you around.
- You never noticed - him before?
So he's been sitting right next to you for months - just pretending - to be your friend?
Wow.
That's sad.
- Well, uh, - his name's Reese.
And guess what?
I'm better than you.
I win.
It's over.
Gretchen?
Gretchen, I Whoa, uh!
Otto, what?
I have seen it, Francis!
The devil cow!
- It had eyes like - burning embers And breath from the bowels of hell!
Oh, it was horrible.
More horrible than this?
We must leave this place.
Burn it down.
Start over.
Yeah.
No.
Enough is enough.
We're not running away from a cow.
We're not?
No.
We're not.
From now on I'm lactose intolerant.
- Okay, Dewey, - here's your costume.
Now, your father and I - will see you at the show - this afternoon.
I'm going to throw up.
What if I forget my part?
What if something flies out of my nose like it did at show and tell?
- Dewey, I'm going to let you in - on a little secret.
- When you're - up on that stage, - All you have to do - is look out in the front row.
- Your father and I - will be sitting there, And you just look me in the eyes and you'll know that everything's going to be all right, okay?
Okay.
And if you still feel like throwing up, use the hat.
-  - Reese totally had that coming.
I'm not arguing.
- Seriously, humiliation - is the only thing That jerk understands.
Fine.
- Why are you - taking his side?
!
Ooh, a birthday card.
Five dollars Canadian.
Pretty good for Grandma.
So, I'll have the rest of my birthday money on Saturday, so I can give you the 300 bucks for the computer when "Dear Malcolm, Ha-ha.
"Now I win.
Your friend, Reese".
They'll try you as an adult!
Uh, yes, I'm looking for a serious graphic novel with cinematic drawings and neat, linear storytelling.
- Weren't you in here - the other day?
No, I Okay, look.
I just want to buy a present for my son, okay?
- I don't think - that's a crime.
As I see it, my only crime is not knowing as much as you.
- Look, you all have parents, - don't you?
I am appealing to you as decent human beings to help me give my son a happy birthday.
Hey, man, I'm sorry.
- I guess we did kind of get off - on the wrong foot.
- We all got to - start somewhere.
This one's called Dead Man's Shoes.
It's 50 bucks.
- It's all about - alienation.
- I think your son - will really like it.
Thank you.
Not so fast.
This transaction does not concern you, Feldspar.
It's Craig Feldspar.
He's a level 45 Dungeon Master.
- What cereal box - did you shake this out of, Dean?
It's the first print.
It's totally collectable.
Oh.
Should we check the Overstreet?
Wait, we don't have to.
all in circulation.
- I'd keep this - in my bathroom, But not for reading.
This isn't a comic book store.
It's a novelty shop!
Oh, really?
Well, I'd like to see the novelty shop that carries an original Spider-Man number 14 with the first appearance of the Green Goblin.
You're kidding.
- If you changed - to a more respectful tone, I just might let What are you doing?
!
Fear not.
It's the 1993 reprint.
If it had been an original, he would have thrown himself in front of it.
Dude, you told me that was real.
Now let's talk business.
- Craig, I can't - thank you enough.
That was fantastic!
You were so heroic.
I like to think we all have a little bit of Aquaman right here.
Well, I must say, you really know your stuff.
I'm impressed.
Well, you know if you're interested, there is a convention next Saturday.
I have a life, Craig.
Car number 15, no bumping.
Return to the pit area.
What the hell are you doing?
!
-  - You had no right!
You stole from me!
That was my money!
Fine.
Let's see.
I've done 63 laps.
Keep the change!
-  - Car eight, let's be courteous.
It ends here, Reese!
I don't care about the money!
I don't care about my birthday!
- I don't care about your safety - or mine!
I don't care about anything except making you suffer!
Well, I don't care either!
Fine!
Let's see who cares the least the most!
Okay, you just lost two weeks arcade privileges.
This is a game of chicken Reese is not going to win!
I'm too angry to blink!
When he sees my face, - he's going to know - he doesn't have a chance!
He's off and flying as he guns the car around the track He's jamming down the pedal like he's never coming back - Adventure's waiting - just ahead He'll stop.
I know he'll stop.
Maybe this wasn't such a good  Ugh!
- I should have told - the doctor - To sew fur and tails - on you boys Because you're animals!
- Only, animals - would be easier - 'cause then - I could have you fixed.
For all the good it does, you're grounded, again.
- Thanks for getting me - grounded on my birthday.
- Oh, boo-hoo, - I was grounded on my birthday.
I was just standing up for myself.
- There is such a thing - as justice, you know!
- Well, there is such a thing - as "shut up"!
Stop it.
Malcolm, do you remember - what you did for your birthday - last year?
- Nothing.
I was - grounded then, too.
And what about your birthday?
You grounded me after - I smashed Malcolm's face - into the cake.
And your birthday before that?
Pretty much this.
Wait.
- When did you push me - off the pony?
Do you realize that neither of you has had a birthday party in his entire life?
Don't you think that's sad?
Every chance you have had for a little happiness A little something special You threw it away.
At some point, this has to stop.
Is revenge ever worth it?
Is it worth it now?
Do you feel happy?
- There's no reason to - compete with each other.
We love you both the same.
There are no favorites in this family.
Where is Dewey?
I said, there's Mr. Lincoln now.
We love you, Dewey.
You can do it, son.
We're so proud of you.
Fourscore and seven years ago Our fathers brought forth Unto this continent A new nation Conceived in liberty And dedicated to the proposition By the people, for the people Shall not perish from this Earth.
- You know, Daniela - could do that, too, - If your affair - hadn't scarred her for life.
Oh, bravo.
Why don't you have another drink?
Francis, this is not the time to study animal husbandry.
We have a cow to kill.
There's got to be something in here that can help us.
You know what will help us?
The bullet.
The bullet is always the answer.
Oh, my God, it is here!
That's it!
I know what we have to do!
Ah!
Oh!
Francis!
Oof!
Oof!
Oh No, please, please, no!
- : - No!
All right, Bessie, - you've been causing - a lot of trouble, And it stops now.
You are going to be milked.
There you go.
You been up in those mountains so long all engorged, no wonder you were so angry.
You're not evil at all.
You're just a lady with a little too much milk.
- Well, this new - game is good, - But it doesn't - quite buy me off.
- You still didn't - come to my play.
Well, how would you like Malcolm's comic book, hmm?
I'm starting to get over it.
Happy birthday, Malcolm.
Thanks.
- Don't eat - that blueberry.
I'm saving it.
- What's the worst - that can happen?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
- NEWSMAN : - That's a doggone good deal.
- And now here's Chip - with the weather.
-  - Bad news, folks.
- Looks like the downpour is going - to continue through the weekend.
Up to two inches of rainfall It's not raining.
Don't forget those umbrellas and galoshes  -  and the three - unidentified boys Fled the scene on foot as hundreds of helpless spectators could only look on in horror.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now - You're not - the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
- It's amazing all - the different kinds of kids - You meet when you're - tutoring after school.
In the last six weeks alone, I've met morons, idiots, lunkheads, jackasses and one imbecile.
My mom's making me do a job where I use my brain.
I'll tell you one thing.
When I have kids they're really going to suffer.
- Stupid job.
I spend my free time - trying to teach You're Nicki?
Hi.
This doesn't make her right.
Lock you inside, every day and every night Oh, girl, and here is the soul of which you've taken control Can't you see I'm trying to show Love is all right?
Oh, show and tell Just a game I play, when I want to say - Boys will be home - in ten minutes.
- I'm willing - to accept that challenge.
No, Hal.
I just went to the doctor.
I have a low-grade infection.
I have to take antibiotics.
And we can't have sex for a week.
What?
Not until I finish these.
- Okay, okay, let's try - to look at this rationally.
- What would happen - if you took them all at once?
No, Hal.
Or, or what if we alternated?
One day off, one day on.
I'm not a medical doctor, but I think it would be - a lot less of a shock - to your system.
A week, Hal.
No sex for a week.
Wow!
All right, I'm fine.
I'll just uh I'll go mow the lawn.
Do we still have that mower?
- Hal?
- Huh?
Clothes.
Oh, right.
Hey, watch where you're driving, you butt-wipe!
What'd you say?
Nothing.
Better watch yourself, jerk-wad.
I'll kick your butt.
Yeah, well, I wish I had a car like that!
Thank you so much for the work that you did last week.
- Now, I insist - that you take this.
Thank you.
What work did you do last week?
Young man, nice job with those weeds yesterday.
Is five dollars okay?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
No way, you didn't pull any weeds yesterday.
- I know.
- What's going on?
It's money day.
Money day?
- Yeah.
I don't know why, but it's - been happening a lot lately.
- Dewey, people - don't have money days.
- I do.
- It's really neat.
There's also cookie days and pat on the head days.
I don't like those so much, but before you know it, it's money day again.
- What do you think - you're doing?
- Putting this - stupid fence back up For the third time this month.
Well, me and Earl went to a lot of trouble tearing it down.
What?
Why would you tear our fence down?
We've got 300 head of cattle we got to get to water.
They got to come through here to get to the wash.
We need this fence.
We had two horses wander off.
It took us a week to find them.
Our ranch has used this trail for over 50 years.
We're not about to stop - for a bunch of city boys - playing horsy!
- Look, just because - it's a dude ranch Doesn't mean I don't bust my ass the same as you.
Hey, cowboy, your fanny pack's ringing.
: Talk to me.
The lavender soap should be next to the potpourri.
Well, did you check with housekeeping?
I'm finally starting to understand trigonometry.
Yeah?
It's useless.
Come on, you need trigonometry.
Say you want to plot the orbit of a lunar You're right, it's useless.
I've noticed you at school.
You have?
In fact, I've been thinking about you a lot.
I heard it, too!
Really?
I know you're super smart, so here's my question: with a brain like that, - do you plan, like, - every moment in your life?
No, I don't think You do.
I know you do.
- You always have to know what's - going to happen next, don't you?
Don't you?
No.
I really like not knowing what's going to happen next.
I mean, even when it's scary.
In fact, I kind of like it when it's scary.
You know, like right now, I don't know what's going to happen next.
Do you?
Well -  - You getting anywhere?
What?
The math.
The thing I'm paying you $6 an hour for.
Oh, yeah, she's really smart.
- She didn't get it - when I tried to explain it.
You didn't try to explain it, you just yelled it at me.
He dropped out of high school, - so whenever anything - makes him feel small, he yells.
I'm sure you could've learned trigonometry if you wanted to.
When?
When I was in 'Nam, tied to a Punjab stick, chin deep in a tiger cage in the Mekong River?
No, I guess not.
Just remember something, hotshot.
Me and a lot of my dead comrades put our asses on the line so you and your little friends could have the freedom to study trigonometry.
Thank you sir.
That was scary.
- Oh, please, he plays that card - all the time.
Last week, he tried to use it - to get a free - Grand Slam at Denny's.
- I think we should - get back to math.
Or you could stop stalling and kiss me.
Kiss you?
Okay, you're obviously crazy.
Your dad's, like, 12 feet away.
- Yeah?
- You're just trying - To create a situation - where he catches me And I get my butt kicked.
Well, I'm not - Hey, morning, Reese.
- How's it going?
- What are you - doing up?
- Well, I was just - lying in bed this morning - Staring at the ceiling, - and I thought, - "Why don't I paint - the kitchen cabinets"?
Oh, I made crepes.
- Crepes?
- Uh-huh.
Come on, sit down.
Look, I've got strawberries, bananas, peaches, drawn butter, maple syrup, you name it.
Dig in.
Hey, honey, where have you been?
- I was up at 4:00 scouring - the grout in the shower And I thought, "The flower market is open this early.
- Why not drive downtown and - buy us some fresh-cut flowers"?
They're beautiful!
Crepes?
-  - Can't, got to make The boys' lunches.
I've already made them lunch.
Oh, well, double lunches.
That was so much fun last night.
When I got home, my mom yelled at me for an hour, but I didn't care.
- I know.
- My dad went nuts.
- I got two veins - and the temple thing.
We get it.
You're dating.
Stevie, how's it going?
Good.
Do you know - How cute you are?
- Yes, so what?
Stop bragging about it.
I was going to ask - If I would dump - Malcolm for you.
- Well, yeah, but you can't - ask me right in front of him.
He has feelings.
If you passed your trig test Oh, yeah, D minus.
Thank you, baby.
All right, I'm sick of school, let's go to the mall.
Ditch?
Yeah, it's just P.E.
But that's a class.
- And it'll be there - tomorrow.
Come on.
Why pretend?
You're right.
Four times we have to put up this fence!
Do they think we are not serious?
Maybe you should talk to them.
Talk to those idiots?
No!
Do they think creating wholesome entertainment for families is for sissies?
- There's arts - and crafts, There's nature hikes, there's costume parties.
Let them try to keep track of what is what on Opposites Day.
Ooh, they will pay for this.
-  - Woo-hoo!
Lunchtime.
Oh, Gretchen, I did not mean for you to see me in my fury.
Otto, I love your fury.
Isn't Otto's fury magnificent, Francis?
I try not to look at his fury.
If they tear this one down, we will make them suffer as they have never suffered.
Or, we might consider trying to reach a compromise.
Do I look French to you?
No!
If it is a range war they want, then by gosh, they will get one.
They do not know what they are up against.
-  - Nice job, son.
- Thanks.
- Wait a minute.
- Why are you giving - him five bucks?
Why?
- This young man - cleaned out my gutters, He sorted my recyclables, and I didn't even ask him to.
You couldn't find a nicer kid.
I wish I could give him more.
Don't worry about it.
It can't be money day.
There is no money day.
I would know about it if there was a money day.
Unless maybe Mom and Dad don't want me knowing about money day.
Excuse me.
- Beat it, kid, I'm trying - to figure something out.
Okay.
Sorry.
I'll just rake around you.
His name is Billy Prescott.
I followed him home.
- He lives, like, - a mile away from here.
He looks exactly like you.
- You're lying.
- Am I?
It's common knowledge, Dewey, - that every person - on this planet has an evil twin.
He's my evil twin?
Fat chance.
The guy's a saint.
You're his evil twin.
- But I don't want - to be an evil twin.
I don't make the rules, Dewey.
Besides, we've been given a golden opportunity here.
To do what?
I don't know yet, - but there's money - and an evil twin.
If we can't figure out how to make this pay off, there is something deeply wrong with us.
Come on, let's go watch some soap operas.
- Things are going great - with Nicki.
We've gone to the planetarium, miniature golf, the movies It's amazing how uncrowded stuff is during school hours.
You know what?
I'd better get home.
I'm grounded.
- You're grounded?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- When my dad found out that - I cut English, he flipped out.
You know what's funny?
- He thinks you're - a bad influence on me.
That is hilarious.
Listen, Nicki - He really doesn't like you.
- Why?
What's wrong with me?
I never did anything to him.
- Everybody doesn't - have to like you, Malcolm.
- I know, but - I like you, And a lot of people would think that's enough.
Get your filthy mouth off of my daughter's face!
Get in the truck.
- What are you doing?
- You're supposed to be at work!
Okay, hotshot, consider this your one and only warning.
You are never, ever to see my daughter again, you got that?
!
- No, Daddy, - take it back!
Take it back!
- I cannot believe - that you would come to the park - And you would - do this to me.
Do you know how embarrassing you are?
I'm okay I'm okay.
I'm just going to lie down here for a minute.
-  - Hey, honey.
Oh, I had a great day.
- You know, I was working - through lunch, And Mr. Collins came by and he started asking me about what I was doing I think I'm getting a raise!
Hal, that's wonderful.
I had a good day myself.
- After I finished - washing the windows And stripping the floors, - I went over our tax returns - for the last seven years.
We overpaid in '99.
You're kidding.
$800.
The IRS is sending us a check.
Wow!
Honey, great job!
You know, I got to tell you, I think Is that the last one?
Mm-hmm.
So we can I guess so.
Great.
Hey.
Stop!
I talked to Nicki's father and he told me what happened.
- You are forbidden - from seeing that girl again.
- Mom - Forbidden!
I told him you wouldn't - give him any more trouble, - understood?
Don't worry.
The guy's a psycho.
And I think she is, too.
- I'm totally - never seeing her again.
- Good morning.
- Hi.
Last night was great.
- Yeah.
Okay, I get - home at 3:00 today.
Dad gets home at 6:00.
- Now, my little brother - is a total narc, - But we can send him to the - arcade till, like, 4:00.
- So we have - No good.
- I've got a chem lab - until, like, 3:30 on Wednesdays.
What about tomorrow?
- No good.
I can't - wait till tomorrow.
- We got to think - of some What?
You can't wait till tomorrow?
Shut up.
- Okay, we'll do it today - and we'll slide it an hour.
- That's cutting it pretty close, - but I'll make it work.
We can make this work.
- Dad.
- Oh.
See you in math.
Okay.
- I might need to see - the nurse first.
I don't want to do this.
If you don't do it, - I'm going to tell Mom - about you taking all that money.
- And you're going - to get a "me" punishment.
Now get to work!
Hey!
What are you doing?
!
Yeah, you better run, Billy Prescott!
All the way to 1515 Cypress Street, a block west of Halifax.
-  I'm glad that we decided - not to, uh Absolutely.
- Every other aspect of our lives - is getting so much attention.
- Our lives are - so much better.
- Do you think that's how really - successful people just?
Can't think of any other explanation.
No.
So Bill Gates?
Probably never.
I started an herb garden in the backyard today.
Did you know we had a potting shed?
You're kidding.
Oh, we are definitely doing the right thing.
I'll go sleep in the car.
- Park it a couple - blocks away.
This one is - Ooh, be careful!
- It might bite through!
We have had some good ones in the past, Francis, but this may be the best pirate night ever.
What are you doing?
!
Easy, Otto.
What do you think you are doing?
- We have a real - ranch to run, - And our cattle - need water.
We need that fence.
I will not allow you to kill our horses.
- Well, I'm not going to allow - you to kill our cattle!
Enough talk.
Gretchen, my gun!
Which one?
Ooh, what am I saying?
The Luger, hmm?
Otto, this is nuts.
You will see you are not dealing with a fool.
That fence is going up twice as high!
- We'll just tear it - back down again.
Then we will build another fence Every time you build it up, we'll tear it down.
Every time you tear it down, we will build it up!
Um, did it ever occur to anyone to put in a gate?
A gate?
Hmm.
A gate would work.
Shave his belly with a rusty razor Earl-aye in the morning - Keep an eye - on your lonely bunkmate Keep an eye on your lonely bunkmate  Sorry.
- I jumped in a line - at the mall to ditch my Dad, - And I ended up giving blood - at the Red Cross.
I told my Mom I was going to the library tomorrow.
No, we are going to the library.
- I thought we were going - to the church fair.
- No, the church fair is - next week.
- It's just a cover - so we can meet at the lake.
- I thought the lake was a - cover for the bowling alley.
- No, I'm supposed to be - at the bowling alley right now.
This is crazy.
I know.
Maybe it'll get crazier.
Oh, my God, my Dad!
-  - You said you were going To the bowling alley!
-  - I changed my mind!
- And why are you - following me?
- Don't you trust me?
- Shh!
Don't you shush me!
You'll learn to shush when someone is shoving bamboo splinters - under your fingernails - trying to get you To rat out your company!
This is worth it.
This is definitely worth it.
For the love of God.
Man, filling up that guy's car with cement was a stroke of genius.
- With Billy Prescott - as our fall guy, We can do anything.
Now, I've updated my enemies list.
Dewey?
Dewey, I'm talking to you.
Have you heard enough?
Oh, yeah.
Okay, now I know what you're thinking.
- But the thing that - you don't realize Is that that I'm not the real Reese.
I just look like me him.
But if-if you hurt us I-I mean him Oh, just go ahead.
- Now that I've finished - the carpet, We can insulate the attic.
I'm telling you, honey, the value of this house is going to triple.
We can retire early.
Lois, what have you planned?
Nothing.
Lois, we made an agreement.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, okay.
- You know, two have to play - at this game, And I'm not playing.
I am just not playing!
- So you think - that's going to work?
Well, I've got news for you, girlie girl.
I am made of sterner stuff.
I happen to like my new life, and I am not about to descend to your animal level.
Tool belt on.
I've had it up to here with your sneaking around.
You're never where you say you're going to be.
- You can't play me - for a fool, Nicki!
- Dad, you are - being paranoid!
- There is nothing - going on Outside of your stupid, little twisted head.
- Well, if I find out - you've been lying, There's going to be hell to pay.
Oh, are you okay?
- I've lost all the feeling - in my arms, But it's distracting me - from the searing pain - in my shoulders.
Poor baby.
Listen, Nicki, I'm not sure this is going to work.
What do you mean?
We do all of this stuff, sneaking around and making all these complicated plans, and it feels incredible.
I have never felt anything so intense in my life, but, I mean, is that it?
What are you saying?
We never do any normal boyfriend/girlfriend stuff.
- I don't know - anything about you, - Except that you really - get off on danger.
And apparently, I do, too.
I'm just not sure that's enough.
- I think you - just insulted me.
No.
I Yes, you did!
- Maybe you don't know - anything about me, But I actually bothered to learn things about you.
I don't like you - because I'm some - creepy danger junkie.
I like you because you're funny, and you're kind, - and you don't let me - get away with stuff.
And even when you complain, you're funny, - and I never have to think - about what I'm going To say because it just comes out.
And it-it feels right, and I feel safe.
Well, wait.
- I like you because - you're really fun and honest.
And I don't feel - like I'm being tricked - when you're nice to me.
You're amazing with my friends.
You're amazing.
Okay, so this is real.
It's not just the danger or whatever.
This is real.
Duh.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I love you.
Night, Daddy.
Oh, no.
I'm late.
Oh, me, too.
- Wait, there - was something - I was supposed to - do at work today.
Come home for lunch?
That's it.
Got to go.
- Bye.
- Bye.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Hey, Mom, I grew an inch!
Life is unfair Stevie, come on.
That's ten in a row.
I'm sick of this.
It's important!
- I worked my butt off - to make the JV team.
I got to stay sharp.
- Could you at least - try to block it?
Still too easy.
Can I put you on a ladder?
Come back, please!
I'll find us a ride!
Those concert tickets cost me $40 each.
That's two times 40.
Divide that in two, and it's $40 a ticket!
- But it's not my fault - I can't drive us.
You're the one who had his license taken away!
Because my public defender wouldn't even try the insanity defense.
- Well, you better - think of something, - Because if we - can't get there, Then we're not going!
Don't ever date anyone smarter than you.
Okay, break's over.
Let's get back to work.
You take it out.
- I want to work - on my defense.
- And this time, - don't just sit there.
- Try to move - the ball around.
My bad.
- I'm sorry.
I know - I'm being a little crazy, - But for the first time - in my life, - I'm actually good - at something - That normal people - care about.
Being on the team is the best thing - that's ever happened to me - and I don't want to screw it up.
- All I'm saying is - that if we want to win, Which I think we do, - it seems to me we should - be using an offense - That has a remote chance - of actually working.
- I can't be the only one here - who thinks - There's something deeply flawed - with your game plan.
- I think if you thought about it - for just a second, You'd realize you need to make some changes.
What the hell is wrong with me?
!
- Why can't I just learn - to shut up?
We're the same.
We speak before we think.
Malcolm!
How many times do I have to tell you to hang up your wet towel after you've used it?
!
Is that so hard?
Because if it is, - maybe we should just - take your towel away.
- And the next time - you take a shower, - You can run around the backyard - until you dry.
Gee, Mom, wouldn't the front yard be more humiliating?
Sorry.
And I don't want any What did you say?
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Well I can see you boys are studying, so maybe this isn't the best time to deal with this.
Do you want any sodas or anything?
- You're sure you like - your birthday present?
Dad, the boots are perfect.
- They're just what I wanted.
- Listen, - They were really expensive, - so take good care of them, okay?
I will.
Don't worry about it.
Thanks again, Dad.
What the hell are you doing?
- Piama, this is an - old cowboy trick.
- You soak your - boots in water, And you don't take them off, even for a minute, - until they are - completely dry, Even if it takes days.
And when you're done, they fit like a glove.
- I know it - seems drastic, - But believe me, - I know what I'm doing.
Those are $300 boots you just ruined.
- I didn't ruin - anything.
- This is what you're - supposed to do!
- You're going to have - to trust me on this.
Why do you always talk to me like I'm an idiot?
"and everyone but the rabbit lived happily ever after".
- And the moral - of that fable, son, Is that turtles are pathological liars who won't give you their gold.
Got it.
Dad?
It's like watching the gods return to Olympus.
Oh, uh, hello excuse me Hey!
What is this called?
We're racewalking.
- I've never seen anything - like it.
The the style, the grace.
Well, it's not all just about looking good.
It's the best low-impact aerobic exercise ever invented, - despite what you hear - from all those Tai-Chi punks.
- Yeah, but how - do you do it?
Well, the International Racewalking Federation specifies you must have one foot on the ground at all times.
But - And your front leg - must remain straight Until it's completely under you.
Something like this?
Hey!
I think you've got it!
Look at that, guys.
I think we got ourselves a natural!
Wow!
Look at me!
I can walk!
Yeah!
-  - So then what happens is - I'm sitting there - eating my lunch when - Carla comes up to me and - she's completely furious at me Because Cody dumped her.
- I mean, yeah, I'm the - one who set then up, But does that make it my responsibility?
Why are you asking me?
I don't even know these people.
- I know, I know.
- I can see her side, too, But she was completely screaming at me.
And now I feel bad because she was crying, and I just kept thinking, "Did I do something so totally wrong"?
I honestly don't care.
- My parents are going - to be home any minute.
Can we please start making out while we still have time?
Uh-uh.
Oh, Malcolm, thank you so much.
I'm so lucky to have you.
You make me feel so good.
Wow, this is fantastic.
I'm never going to say what's on my mind ever again.
All I have to do is keep my mouth shut.
- Just not say a word and let her - do all the talking and Dad, please.
- The concert's Saturday night.
- I need a ride!
Reese, no!
Your mom has to work and my car's in the shop.
You'll just have to find someone else.
Are my hips even?
- Watch my butt - while I walk.
Dad, I swear to God, if you don't drive me, I will leave home forever!
Or I'll never leave Whatever's worse.
It's your choice, pal.
- I think you're - going to like this.
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
I put it in my mouth, - your toenail - clippings are in it, I spit it out, and you've got it all on video.
It's been done.
I am so sorry about that.
But we've both grown up a lot since then, and I have a proposal I think you might find interesting.
It's still warm.
Now, I know a hip guy like you - keeps up with - the current music scene.
It's awfully short notice and you're probably not even available.
What are you talking about?
There's a concert this Saturday, and Alison and I were wondering if you'd like to go.
You want me to go to a concert with you?
Yeah, pretty much.
But the real fun part - is the drive there - and the drive back.
- But I don't have - to tell you, right?
- I mean, look who - I'm talking to A single, middle-aged guy with a cat?
You know all about the dating scene.
Well, sure, that's my rep, but - I mean, it's not - like you're even excited To go out on a real date.
- It's not - like it's something - That you'd be bragging - about for weeks - : Of course not.
- I mean, who cares?
- But if people - were to ask, I'm not forbidden to tell them, am I?
Not at all.
This is going to be great.
- And you say I can - tell people, right?
Hello, everybody!
Hey, Hal!
Hey, it's "The Natural"!
- I have to tell you, Hal, - I've never seen anybody - Take to the sport - as fast as you.
- What's it been, - three days?
- Already, you're - better than I am.
Now, now, it's not about the competition.
I mean, it's not a race, right?
-  - Whoa!
It's only a matter of time till we're surrounded.
Now, we've got to get word to Allied Command, - but any radio messages - will be intercepted.
You think I don't know that?
I've sent for our secret weapon.
You called for me, sir?
- Corporal.
- I don't need to tell you The fate of the entire free world depends on you delivering this message to Allied Command by morning.
My God, that's 60 miles away.
I'll say hello to the boys at HQ for you over waffles, sir.
Let's just thank God he's on our side.
Oh, my God, it's Wheeler.
- He must be back - from the Nationals.
On your left.
On your left!
On your right!
On your left!
On your right!
Okay, just be cool.
No matter what he says, don't say anything.
- How much simpler - can it get?
!
You pass, pass, pass, dribble, dribble, pass, dribble, pass, shoot!
Um, excuse me, Coach.
Well, well, well look who's here.
Coach, I'd like to apologize for the other day.
I'd like to get back on the team.
So, you'd like to apologize and get back on the team?
I think I just said that, yes.
Do you know what this is?
A symbol of my authority.
They don't just hand these whistles out to just anybody.
It means that I'm in charge.
I call the plays.
Understood?
Yeah.
It's a magic whistle that makes you all-powerful.
All right.
You're back on the team.
Time!
and 43.2 seconds.
Damn!
- Are you sure you - started it exactly - When I called - you from work?
- Yes.
Do you want me - to lie to you?
All right, go ahead and log in the time, son.
Hey, look, Malcolm, come here.
- I need you to help me - make sense of all these times.
- Now, these are - the last three days.
- Some of these are with the cap, - some without.
- Some with bike shorts, - some without; one with both, One in just my pajamas.
So you can whip up - some kind of scientific analysis - of all this, right?
Sure, I've only got better to do with the rest of my life.
Okay.
You're a good son.
By the way, how much allowance are we giving you?
What family do you live in?
Nothing, why?
Well, how does five bucks a week sound?
- Great.
- Hey!
-  - Dewey, he's older, and he - doesn't give me as much malarkey When I ask him for a favor.
- Are you biting - your nails again?
Those look horrible.
No.
They're fine.
- Look, I've only - got two minutes.
A woman thinks I'm looking in the stock room for a humidifier.
- Now, I want you - to listen to this tape - And tell me whether - you think it's better To go ELO-Kansas-Doobies or Doobies-Kansas-ELO.
- I'm not telling you - which one I'm voting for.
- What are you - talking about?
The mix tape!
For our date!
Didn't you get my e-mails or phone messages - or the notes I left - under your door?
- No, I have a lot of homework - to do during the week, - And I can't - really spend - Look, just listen - to it tonight And get back to me with your top four choices.
- Now, what do you - think for a shirt?
- I like the blue, - but I'm worried The open-collar look is a bit racy.
- You don't have - any pants on!
That's what these are for.
- I want you to pick your - favorites separately, - Then we'll decide - what goes together.
Whatever.
I am going to call you a million times before Saturday.
- I haven't been this - excited in years.
Now I know why people look forward to weekends.
: Oh, please.
You know, you're not finished till you put those away and wipe down the counters.
Why don't I buff the floor - and lick your shoes - while I'm at it?
!
Yes, ma'am.
Look at me.
Are you on drugs?
What?
- You've been acting - really strange lately, - And I want to know - what's going on.
- Well, apparently no one - in this house can tolerate it When someone's actually being pleasant!
Nothing.
Nothing?
- So, everything's fine, - everything's normal, - You're not acting any different, - and I'm just crazy.
She's begging for it!
Nail her!
I'm fine, really.
- Well, you're looking - a little tired.
Why don't you let me finish up?
All right.
Dad, please, it's been three hours.
Come on, Wheeler, give me something.
What's your secret?
- You're starting - to ruin TV for me.
I study your moves, I copy your techniques, but somehow you continue to blow me out of the water.
Why?
!
How?
!
- Maybe he's just - better than you.
- Have you ever - thought of that?
Billy Vargas can spit ten feet further than I can.
I accept that.
Why can't you?
Oh, Dewey, maybe you're right.
Maybe God didn't put me on this Earth to beat this guy.
I mean, look at him.
Perfect posture, great hip rotation, his Wait a minute.
Both feet off the ground at the same time!
Dewey, do you see that?
!
That's air.
That that's air!
That's it!
I'm going to go read a book!
I hope you're happy!
Now, since Jeanette got the T-shirt from my last 50K, I think it's only fair to give you girls my socks.
Oh, my God!
Sorry to interrupt, Wheeler, - but I thought - we could have a little race.
Apparently, this man's a lot like you girls You all can't get enough of looking at my backside.
This shouldn't take long.
- Oh, and just - one more thing.
This time, just to be different, let's walk.
What are you talking about?
- You thought - no one would discover - Your dirty little secret, - didn't you?
That clever little - flail of the wrist - every four steps, Masking the hop.
But you can't fool the tape.
The tape sees all, and I see the tape.
- You are not a racewalker - at all.
- You're nothing - but a common jogger.
That is so rid Don't worry.
He won't get far.
One-two-three, there!
One-two-three, there!
One-two-three, there!
So, then, when I was 13, I got my first velour shirt, and everything changed.
Suddenly, there was an opening in the astronomy club.
People started sitting on my side of the bus.
- But I'm a Libra, - so I like to think The best of people.
So, Craig, I was telling Alison how well you focus on your driving.
- No, you were - just telling me - That if I really loved you, - I'd let you get under my - So, you guys like - to take long walks on the beach?
I sure do.
Plus, I'm a grand master at Battleship.
I've got the hat if you'd like to see it.
So, Ali, do you have any brothers or sisters?
- What do you think - you're doing?
!
- You don't talk to me.
- You just start kissing?
- I am a person, - and I deserve - Some conversation - and some of the social niceties Before the kissing starts.
- You know what, I was okay - when he pulled over twice - To change his shirt, - but I really don't think He should be yelling at me.
- Okay, don't freak out.
- I can handle this.
- My family kind - of owns him.
You know, Craig, another thing girls really like - is the strong, - silent type.
Craig, Craig, you just passed the concert!
Oh, no, I don't think so.
- But there was a sign, - and it had an arrow, And we're supposed to follow the pointy end!
Oh, come on.
- There's other fun things - we can do.
- I thought we'd start - with a hayride, - And then a light - dinner at Cicero's.
- I've already tipped - the violinist - To drop by our table, - for the lady.
- Then I thought - we'd cap off the evening - With a nice, romantic bonfire - at the lake.
Craig, you are ruining our date!
Now, listen here!
Do you know how long - I have dreamed - and planned for this night?
And I am not going to let you little brats ruin it!
We are going to have a hayride and dinner and a bonfire, and this is going to be a magical evening that will live in our hearts forever!
- What's that - on your glasses?
What?
Oh, my God!
Reese, you said she'd be nice to me!
You said she'd like me!
Yeah, let's ditch this loser.
Okay, okay.
See you at school.
CRAIG : Why?
Well, as you can see, - Miss Doubting Piama, - it may have taken - Days and days - of wearing sopping wet boots, But they are now snug, supple and perfectly form-fitting.
You were right, honey.
Which would also make you Mistaken.
You know, I could push for a more abject admission of your wrongness, but I'm going to be a bigger man.
With better boots.
- Call me - when you get tired of this.
Could be late.
Oh!
If I hold out for a few days, maybe the fungus will eat the mushrooms.
- How can we be losing - to a team That hasn't won a game in three years?
!
Maybe because you're a complete moron!
You know I can shoot!
Why won't you put me in?
!
- For God's sake, - that's it.
Time-out!
- All right, - everybody up, come on!
All right, you yo-yos.
- Do you want to know why - we can't beat this team?
Because you're not letting anyone shoot!
We're just passing the ball back and forth!
- Nobody on this team - has any heart.
Not a man.
- You know, when the Allies - first hit the beach at Iwo Jima, They didn't have better weapons than the Germans.
They had something more than firepower.
Have you completely lost your mind?
!
Put me in!
Let me shoot the ball!
- Not one of you - has been able to forget About the water in your boots, or the sand in your mess kit long enough to focus on the success of the entire unit!
- : Tell him to shut up - and put you in.
Tell him, tell him!
Malcolm do you think you can follow my game plan?
- No, because - you're a freakin' idiot.
I hate you.
I want to kill you and dance on your shallow grave.
That's my game plan.
All right, get in there.
Thanks.
A peptic ulcer?
How did you manage to get a peptic ulcer?
The doctor said you have the stomach lining - of a 60-year-old air - traffic controller.
- You are a teenager, - for God's sake.
What do you have to be stressed about?
!
For your information, - I just spent the past - three hours on a gurney - Next to a guy - who is still trying to smoke Out of the hole in his neck.
And the jackass who put in this I.V. - couldn't find a vein - with two hands and a flashlight!
- My call button - doesn't work!
- These stupid sheets - are itchy.
- There's only one channel - on the TV.
- And what's this - about a bedpan?
!
This is great, isn't it?
- Alison's nice, - but I have to say - I think a date's better - with just two people.
Can we stop calling this a date?
Well, whatever it is, - I can't wait to see the look - on my neighbor's face When I come strolling home after 11:00.
Eat your heart out, Mrs. Klevesahl.
I think I just missed my curfew.
There are no curfews on a night like tonight.
Here I am, the one that you love Asking for another day Understand the one that you love Loves you in so many ways
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
-  -  Come on, let's go!
- What are we - waiting for?
!
Dad's taking us to Francis' dude ranch for the weekend.
Just the guys.
- I'm really going to miss - my girlfriend Nicki.
- But then again, - it's two days without Mom.
I've been in the car since 6:00.
-  - Come on, Dad!
You'll see her Sunday!
I, uh had to get my coffee.
Okay, gentlemen - ready to roll?
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Let's roll already!
- Yeah, come on, Dad.
Seat belt check.
Map check.
Sunglasses check.
Lumbar pillow check.
Mirrors check.
Does that sound like a loose valve casing to you?
Dad!
All right.
You boys will soon learn there's nothing wrong with being careful.
Wow!
Welcome to the Grotto.
I'll be with you in one minute.
- No rush.
- We're just looking for Francis.
Francis?
You are Francis' family?
Yes, we were just  Welcome, family of Francis.
I am Otto, and this is Gretchen.
We have dreamed for months of meeting you - and now finally - you are here.
And look at beautiful liebling!
Your son is a genius.
He has completely turned this place around.
- Well, not physically, - of course.
We still face the arroyo as before, but we could never have survived - without his hard work, - Mm-mm.
- His intelligence - Mm-hmm.
His leadership Really?
- Now, you just have - the one Francis?
As long as you are here, everything is on the house.
- Now, would you like - to review the staff?
Oh, I Please?
It would mean so much to them.
- Good.
- Mmm.
Well Aren't they wonderful?
They are Hopi Indian kachina dolls.
- Now, according - to legend, He tracks down misbehaving children - und chews up - their bones So no one will ever find them again.
Mythology is so much fun, don't you think?
Oh, no, no.
No.
They are far too valuable.
- You mustn't - touch them.
Can I trust you?
I don't see why not.
Uh very nice.
- I like your boots.
- Give him your boots.
No, no!
No, no, I couldn't.
You all look wonderful.
Thank you.
Do you hear that?
He likes us.
Back to work.
Hey, guys.
I'm so sorry.
- I came as fast - as I could.
- Hey.
- I-I'm not going - to get too close.
- I'm fighting - a terrible cold.
- I'll probably be - in bed all weekend.
Mom didn't come.
Well, we'll just have to enjoy ourselves without her.
Come on.
So, where's Francis?
- Is he really - the foreman?
- We haven't seen him - in months.
- You'll have to forgive - the boys.
- They've always - looked up to Francis Like he's some kind of hero.
How's it going, guys?
My God, Francis!
How the heck did you learn to ride a horse like that?
- Well, you got to pick it up - quick around here.
We break horses, brand cattle It's about as close to the Old West as you'll ever find.
Where do I find the jazzercise class?
Other side of the smoothie bar.
- Oh, that chicken - was fantastic.
- And where'd you learn - to cook chili like that?
- I spend time - in the kitchen, too.
The secret to good chili is how long you soak the beans.
- So, to recap - our little contest Dewey wins for most tuneful.
Francis for the loudest.
I was the sneakiest.
Malcolm, the most obnoxious.
Ech.
- At least - I wasn't disqualified.
I gambled and lost.
It happens.
This is fun.
- Why don't we do this - every weekend?
Boy, wouldn't that be nice?
Oh, I almost forgot.
- Francis, I booked a - trip for all of us To watch the sunrise tomorrow morning at Devil's Rock.
- I don't want - to get up at sunrise - To go look - at some stupid rock.
- It may be a stupid rock - for most of the year, But for the rest of this week - the angle of the sun at dawn - makes it look - Like there's fire coming out - of the devil's eyes.
- Actually, - I can't do it tomorrow, Dad.
What do you mean you can't?
- You were the one who called me - and told me about it.
- I know, but I have to lead - a ride at 7:00 And it takes me two hours to get the horses ready.
- Can we go - on that ride?
- Yeah, can we?
- Sure.
- Yeah!
- All right.
- Hey, what - are you doing?
- I brought some stuff - I wanted to burn.
You're on cowboy time now.
- You got to get to bed early - and rest up - If you want to come riding - in the morning.
Bed?
But I'm not tired.
Sorry about the Devil's Rock thing.
Hey, don't worry about it.
I'll go by myself.
It'll be great.
Here it comes.
Wow.
That's amazing, Dad.
I'm so happy we could do this together, son.
- All right, we got - some loose gravel coming up - So let's keep - your horses in line.
How do you know if the one you're on is still alive?
- No one rides fast until - you're familiar with the horses.
- So, let's keep both - hands on the reins And keep those helmets on tight.
What's with Francis?
- I don't know.
- We've been riding for an hour, I can still see the barn.
Whoa, those look cool.
When can we ride those?
- You're not going - anywhere near those.
What?
Why not?
Because I know you guys - and I don't want - to take a day off work Just to peel your carcasses out of a barbwire fence.
- Why don't you guys - just and relax And enjoy the scenery?
You seem to be the only riders having a problem.
Is Joey the big cowboy?
Yes, he is.
Yes, he is.
Why won't you guys play Ping-Pong with me?
- The table's free and I've - got the equipment form For Dad to sign.
- Because you're stupid.
- And we didn't come - All the way - out here To be stuck playing with you.
Wait just a minute.
That is precisely why we came out here So that we can all have a good time together.
Now, your brother asked you to play with him and that is exactly what you are going to do.
- Our dad signed the permission - slip for the ATVs.
Mmm.
You don't look 16 to me.
It's a glandular thing.
He's very sensitive about how short he is.
Ooh.
Perhaps you are a late bloomer.
I had my baby teeth until I was 14.
I'll get the keys.
"All terrain".
I wonder if that actually means all terrain.
- They couldn't say it - if it wasn't true.
Whee-hee!
Okay, so trees aren't terrain.
Now we know.
Ow!
I specifically told you guys - stay away - from those ATVs!
What the hell were you thinking?
!
They don't think, Francis.
They never have!
- The only thing their - heads are good for - Is to plug up - their necks.
I blame the oldest one.
The others follow him like sheep.
- I thought I could - trust you guys - On your own for - a few minutes.
- Well, obviously - I was wrong.
- You are still the same - stupid, reckless idiots You've always been.
- Francis, you don't have - to yell at them like that.
- I'll yell at - whoever I want!
- And even though I wish - I hadn't said that, It's too late now!
From now on, you boys stay away from the horses, the vehicles, the pool and the other guests.
- That means you - are confined - To your room until - further notice.
- You're sending us to our room?
!
- That's right.
I don't believe it.
You've turned into Mom.
Yeah?
Well, sometimes Mom's right.
You take that back!
Oh, my God.
You broke my doll?
How could you be so thoughtless?
You promised me you would leave it alone, but it was just a lie.
Oh All right, boys, go to your room now!
There, there.
We will give him new legs and then he will be all good again just like cousin Heinrich.
- Well, you did the - right thing, Francis.
I just don't know when they're going to learn.
Them?
What about you?
- How could you sign - a release form And not read what it's intended for?
For God's sake, Dad, my job is hard enough as it is.
"Sometimes Mom's right?
Sometimes Mom's right"?
Why didn't he just throw acid in our faces?
You know, I'd actually prefer that.
- I can't believe - he yelled at us - Right in front - of that French guy.
He can't get away with this.
We're going to get him back.
You're damn right we are.
Are you with us, Dewey?
Dewey?
- And I know - I shouldn't have taken it But it looked so cool.
And then in the tree I forgot it was in my pocket, and I fell and it broke.
Oh, I know, I know, sweetheart.
And you know what?
- I should never - have yelled at you.
I feel terrible about that.
You do?
Oh, of course I do.
So, we both feel bad about what we did, huh?
You know what your Tante Gretchen does when she feels bad?
She works.
She works herself to the point where her body screams in pain - and her soul - begs for mercy.
Why?
It's the best form of penance.
Oh, when my fingers are raw, and my back is racked with crippling pain, I feel all better.
Well, that might work for you - Let's do it.
- Oh!
This will be wunderbar.
- The two old men - go for a ride.
See the beauty of the desert, commune with nature I just hate to take up too much of your time.
I already told the horses that we're going.
Don't make me look bad.
Whoo!
- Wh-what's the matter - with this horse?
Nothing.
Buttercup is very sweet.
Are you sure you're not still angry with the boys?
Buttercup is very good at picking up unresolved feelings.
No.
I told you, I'm over it.
I'm fine.
Buttercup is never wrong.
Once Gretchen made me an omelet with mushrooms.
Oh, I hate mushrooms.
But I didn't say anything.
I had two helpings.
Well, Buttercup forced me to go back and confront her.
We had the best sex we had had in years.
Thank you, Buttercup.
- Maybe I should - ride your horse.
Good idea.
- Scout doesn't pick up - on anything Unless you're secretly gay.
Thanks, very much.
- Hey, fellas, - what can I do for you?
Um, we're looking for some sparklers.
- And do you have any of those - things called pinwheels?
Sure do.
- Also got some - lady fingers.
Okay, let's start with 18 genies, - two dozen gel-ignited - pomegranates - And a case - of devil dragons.
We're out of the 99s, you want 44s at half price?
Make it six packs of red dogs with time-delay fuses.
Powder or aluminum phosphate?
- Who do you think - you're dealing with?
-  - One last thing.
We're planning an event for a friend.
- You got anything that - will make it really special?
Depends on how much you're willing to spend.
Why don't you let my dad worry about that?
Boys I'd like to introduce you to the Komodo 3000.
Oh, yeah.
This will get him back.
How are we doing?
My fingers hurt but that bad feeling in my stomach is getting better.
This is good.
- It means you are getting - in touch with your guilt, ja?
What's the matter?
I just remembered when I was nine, my uncle gave me a pfennig to put in the wishing well but I threw a pebble in the well und I kept the pfennig.
I am pure evil.
I once put a garden slug in Reese's sandwich and he ate it.
Und you feel bad about this?
Then scrub.
Oh, look.
Blood.
We are halfway there.
- I can see why you - love it out here, Otto.
- Yeah, yeah, this is where - I come to think, To unwind, or when I am in the doghouse with Gretchen.
Ooh, I can be a naughty boy.
- I have a barstool in the garage - for the same thing.
Oh.
Well - I suppose we should be - heading back.
Yeah, yeah, we could do that or we could get to know each other a little better.
Is that schnapps?
In my experience, many interesting things can be discovered with just the proper dosage.
Watch this.
Oh, good shooting.
- You shot that rock - clean into two.
Yeah!
- To Hal.
- To Otto.
Salud.
Salud!
Oh, have you ever seen so many stars in the sky.
Oh, look.
Up there.
- There's Orion.
- Where?
Right there.
- Those three stars - are his belt.
What?
There?
No.
There.
And there is his spear.
Oh, great.
Something scared off the horses.
Oh  Ooh.
Whoa.
Run!
Ooh!
Something bit me.
Oh, God, Otto, you're wounded.
Finally I hit something.
Well, I just listened - at the boys' door - and not a peep.
- I hated coming - down on them like that - But that's the only way - they'll listen.
Absolutely.
I mean, I think I was hard but fair.
- You couldn't have - been more fair.
- Okay, and now you're smiling - which means In about two seconds I'm going to look like a jackass.
- You can keep going - if you want.
- Just tell me.
- The boys haven't been - In the room for three hours.
- What?
They want you to meet them at the south gate.
This should explain everything.
I'm afraid it starts off a little antagonistic.
Is that last word "lick" or "wipe"?
I think you're safe either way.
How far do you think we've gone?
Well, judging by that rock formation over there, about 12 feet.
Oh, if only Francis knew we were out here he would save us.
Oh, sure.
Super Francis.
He'd make a jetpack out of a cactus and fly us all home.
Why are you so angry at Francis?
I am not angry at Francis.
Well, well you shouldn't be.
He is smart, he is capable, he is hardworking and I personally never met anyone more "relibable".
Yes, now.
When I had him for 18 years, I punished him and threatened him and cried over him and begged him and screamed at him and his life was one train wreck after another.
Two months with you and now he's a model citizen.
And this is what you are so upset about?
Yes, I think it's pretty obvious.
All he needed was his father to get out of his face so that he could meet someone who knows how to turn his life around.
Well, if I am such a genius, how come that I am drunk and lost in the desert with a bullet in my ass?
Hal, listen to me.
Francis had all of his great qualities on the day that I met him.
What?
What do you think?
He just picked them up off the road?
"Hello, I would like a Big Gulp and a candy bar and a new personality".
No, Hal.
Listen to me.
Your acorn did not fall very far from your tree.
So I'm not such a failure as a father?
Absolutely not.
Now, if your crisis is over, my buttocks could use a vigorous rubbing.
They are starting to go numb.
Oh, that's it, Dewey.
We can't miss a spot.
Right corner.
Got it.
Ja.
I think that is it.
Finally, we are finished.
Wow, I feel wonderful.
Ja, it's beautiful, isn't it?
This is the moment you work for.
Your soul is set free.
Your burden has been lifted.
I kind of feel like I'm floating.
Well, that's probably the ammonia but we have done well.
A clean room leads to a clean conscience, ja?
- I think I'm happier - than I've ever been.
Mm, me, too, liebe.
Here, I want to give you something.
Promise you will think of me when you use it.
Thank you, Tante Gretchen.
De nada.
- I don't know - what you guys are trying - To pull here - but you should know - I am way ahead - of you.
What's that?
Looks like a fuse.
All right, what exactly are you planning?
- We're planning - to get you back.
We want our brother back the way he used to be.
- We know how much - you always liked fire Explosions Nice try.
That was a long time ago.
Really?
So, where does this go?
Well, I suppose you could find out by crawling over the fence and following the fuse or you could find out the Francis way.
- We're sure you'll make - the right decision.
Guys, I'm telling you, things are different now.
I'm married, I have responsibilities.
I'm just not a 16-year-old maniac anymore who Huh, interesting.
Does anything look familiar, Otto?
Just keep heading towards those mountains.
Behind us is certain death.
That's right, this way is certain death.
I wonder what that is.
I'll tell you what that is.
That is Francis showing us the way home.
I told you he'd get us out of this.
- Yes, of course.
- Come on, come on.
This may even top Homecoming '98.
I don't know.
- That float - smoldered for a week.
How do we know which one's the Komodo 3000?
: Let's hope that was it.
Did it say when our vision would come back?
Box said two days.
Totally worth it.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Check this out.
What does it say?
- Just read it.
- It's funny.
I don't read.
- Not unless I absolutely - have to for school.
Otherwise, I feel like they've won.
You never read the paper?
No.
Not even comics?
Like Peanuts?
You never read Peanuts?
Nope.
Are you serious?
You've never read Peanuts?
Uh-uh.
Go ahead.
I promise I'll hold it.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now - You're not - the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Malcolm, I said come in for breakfast!
Francis and Piama came to visit - at the same time - Grandma was here.
Eight people, seven sleeping spaces.
Guess who gets the shaft.
This is my reward for being at the library when they asked for a volunteer.
Malcolm, this is your last chance!
I got to get in there.
Breakfast has turned into the best part of the day.
- I can't believe - what I'm hearing!
Are you insane or just evil?
: Aah!
Wolves should rip out your throat!
What kind of a complete idiot butters their toast like that?
!
Everybody knows it's inside to outside!
Come talk to me of toast when you grow some hair in your pants.
Stupid animal thinks he knows about toast.
Mom, would you please pass the potatoes?
I think you've had more than enough potatoes.
Does the chair have - to break - before you stop eating?
I told you my family was worse than your family.
Are you kidding?
- My grandpa chopped the pinky - off our milkman For bringing us two percent.
Hey!
Mom, Grandma just stole my bacon.
Reese, this is Grandma's last day here.
If she wants your bacon, you let her have it.
Crybaby.
Okay, Ida, - I went ahead and did - all your packing for you.
Let's get a move on.
- Bus doesn't leave - for three hours.
Yeah, but, uh, there could be a parade.
It could take us all day to get through the traffic.
Oh, great.
- There's barely - any food left.
Well, you should have come when I called you.
Call when you get home, Mom.
We'll miss you.
- Even the little - one lies.
- Reese, I asked you - to rake these leaves.
I'm waiting for the rest of them to fall first.
Let's not delay Grandma - by having this needless - discussion, shall we?
Oh, sure.
Can't wait to get me out your door.
Forcing an old woman on the  : Mom!
Grandma's back.
- Mom wants you - to help her unpack.
- This is unbelievable.
- It's all Reese's fault.
- If he had just cleaned up the - yard like he was supposed to, - None of this would - have happened.
Malcolm, she slipped on a leaf.
A tiny, single leaf.
I wouldn't be surprised - if she broke her collarbone - on purpose - Just so she could stay here - and torment us.
And I'm the one who suffers.
I was so close to sleeping in the house again.
I forget what a bed feels like.
What are you complaining about?
- I'm the one who had to carry her - to the car - With her dress hiked up - over her hips.
- I went blind - for almost 15 minutes.
Oh, it's just you.
What are you doing?
Everyone's blaming me for Grandma getting hurt, - and I got an idea for - how to cheer everyone up.
What are you going to do?
I don't know if I can trust you.
Come on, you can.
Hmm.
Tell you what.
- Punch yourself - in the face.
Okay, you're in.
- First thing you can do - is show me How to turn this thing on.
Your fingers are too fat.
Who has fingers like that?
I'm losing my appetite just looking at them.
- She can feed - herself, Lois.
I didn't ask for this.
This is your fault.
You keep your yard like a jungle.
And steps.
Who builds a house with steps?
You think you're better than everybody else?
Well?
My family's still worse.
My mom faked stomach cancer so she wouldn't get custody.
There's time.
- Just use your tongue - as leverage.
Enough!
I had better food in refugee camp.
Boy, everyone's in such a crappy mood.
It's awful.
- If only there was some - way to cheer everyone up.
Be cool.
I'll get it.
It's for me.
- Here, Mom, - let me help you.
You're eating dinner?
Nobody even called me!
- What happened - to your face?
An owl flew into my tent.
If I knew I was missing dinner, - I would have grabbed the snake - out of his beak.
Yes?
Is this 1233 Go ahead.
This is her.
You've been served.
- What are you waiting for, - a tip?
Get out of here!
You're suing us?
Okay, you win.
You're suing us?
!
Hal, keep it down.
The boys are in the house.
Don't be so dramatic.
I am suing insurance company.
- Our insurance - company!
You don't think I have a case?
You don't think I have pain?
That I have suffered?
For years, I have suffered in silence.
Useless, miserable, money-grubbing old hag!
Keep talking tough, boy.
I sue you, too.
- All right, - everybody just calm down.
- Mother, please, - think about what you're doing.
You are suing your own child.
- I don't want to talk - about it anymore.
Let the lawyers handle it.
Lawyer?
!
We don't have a lawyer.
Well, you better get one.
- She can't get - away with this!
I've had it!
- I'm going to toss her out - on her cage.
Hal, we can't do that.
She's my mother.
My twisted, horrible monster of a mother.
- Why don't we just - kill the old hag?
Oh, just stop it right now.
And nobody tells the boys about any of this.
You mean about killing her?
No, Hal.
About the lawsuit.
Oh.
- I think I'm going to be sick.
- I know.
- I feel the same way.
- No, I really think I'm going to throw up.
-  - Well, I think I figured out why you're feeling so lousy, Lois.
You're pregnant.
Pregnant?
Congratulations.
This is the best part of my job.
- Seeing the looks - on people's faces When I give them the good news.
This is fantastic.
Thank you so much, Doctor.
Now, you're 100% sure?
Because it would be terrible if you were somehow wrong.
Like, maybe my chart got mixed up with someone else's?
No.
It's your chart.
I promise.
Could you just - make our happiness complete - and-and And check again?
Yes.
Take as much blood as you need.
Just be certain.
We wouldn't want you to take our dream away.
Relax.
I am absolutely sure.
Congratulations.
- Oh, my God, - this is awful!
This can't be right.
- This must be - some sort of mistake.
What are we going to do?
- I don't know.
We can't - afford the children we have!
If this baby is half as bad - as our least bad one, - we're still ruined.
Oh, this has got to be some kind of cruel joke!
Terrible.
Just terrible.
Are you as turned on as I am?
Hal!
I'm done with my business.
You can't fool me.
I know you're out there.
Okay, whose turn is it?
She's not my grandma.
Okay, I'm thinking of a number.
-  - Wait a minute.
- You're just - writing down the number So you can't be the one.
One.
That's it.
You're up.
- Enjoy.
- Go ahead, Malcolm.
This is so unfair!
I don't even live here.
The longer you wait, the worse it'll be!
I hate you all.
You know, my parents don't come home for another half an hour.
You're dreaming.
Come on!
I'm going crazy.
Okay.
Hey, guys, I'm going to go show Piama - the posters in your room - for a while.
- Have fun.
- Good idea.
I thought they'd never leave.
Tell me about it.
Okay, it's still good.
I'll get the gift wrap.
You write the card.
There's no lock?
With my brothers?
- They just got the door back - a few months ago.
I don't know, Francis.
This feels weird.
In your brothers' bedroom.
No.
This room is fine.
- I've had plenty - of girls in here Quit while you're ahead.
-  - That's good enough.
No one's going to eat off it.
Okay, maybe not in here.
Mom we need to talk.
Um - we just got some interesting - news from the doctor.
Yes.
It's, uh, very good news.
Well, kind of good news.
It's extreme news.
I'm pregnant.
You're joking.
Believe me, we were as surprised as as you are.
Um, you know, we're already stretched to the limit financially.
And, obviously, another baby is going to make things even harder for us.
Yeah, so in light of that - and the burden - it's going to put on us, Don't you think that certain actions should be reexamined?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
You should settle.
What?
!
Mom!
It's for your own good.
- If you can't keep your legs - closed for 20 minutes, At least take good advice when you hear it.
Sleeping is the only thing that makes my life worthwhile.
- I can dream - I'm somewhere decent.
Hey, Malcolm, we need to borrow the tent for about an hour.
Two hours.
What?
Why?
- None of your business.
- We just need it.
- No.
It's bad enough I've been - kicked out of the house.
- Now you want to take - away the one place I have - With just the tiniest - piece of privacy?
- Forget it.
- Find your Ow!
Thanks, really.
I hope you're happy.
- Forcing your - own brother - Out into the night - in his underwear.
We're going to need that.
What are we going to do?
- We're in debt - up to our eyeballs as it is.
Well, we're just going to have to cut back.
No more vacations.
Stop going out to fancy restaurants for birthdays.
- And, you know, it - wouldn't kill us - To stop wearing - designer labels.
- Hal, whose life - are you leading?
We don't do any of that stuff.
We can't afford this baby.
Where's he going to sleep?
- We're not even going - to be able to feed him - After my mother - gets finished with us.
Oh, God, this is so unfair.
Honey, relax.
- Here's what we're - going to do.
- First, I'm going - to go out And get you some mint chocolate chip ice cream.
Now, that always helps.
- And then we're just - going to sit down - And figure this - all out, hmm?
Hey, everything is going to be okay, hmm?
We'll find a way.
We always do.
Promise.
: Oh, no!
Why me?
!
No.
Why?
!
Why?
!
Why?
!
Why, why, why, why?
!
Why?
!
Oh, why?
!
Okay, I'm really getting sick of this.
Nobody should know a beetle tastes better than a june bug.
Can I have more pancakes?
-  You've had ten - already, Reese.
Don't be a pig.
We need to save every penny we can.
- Dewey, go easy - on the orange juice.
That stuff doesn't grow on Wait, it does.
So, why is it so damn expensive?
- Yeah, Dewey, you wouldn't - want to be greedy.
A greedy, conniving old lady who doesn't have a shred of decency in her entire body.
The hooligan talks of decency.
How amusing.
Why is that amusing?
None of your business.
Okay.
- Hal, I need - to talk to you - About, uh - the thing.
Which thing?
The first thing, or the other thing?
They know about the thing.
Shut up.
- It's probably a - different thing.
I just got off the phone with the insurance company.
They say that our rates are going to triple.
What?
!
Even putting in the claim - is going to cost us.
- Triple?
!
Oh - Well, I guess we should - probably tell the kids.
Who knows, they might have a few bucks we can borrow.
No, let's not tell them yet.
I know my mother.
- I know that if we give her - one last chance, She'll do the right thing.
I just know it.
And you understand - everything - I've explained to you - About the - deposition process?
Yes.
- You don't have - to do that.
Sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no, - sorry, Malcolm.
- You can't come - in right now.
- What are you talking about?
- I live here.
Sorry, you just can't.
- Now I can't even go - into my own house?
- Why am I always the one - singled out for abuse?
Reese and Dewey are in there.
No, they're not.
Francis and Piama took them miniature golfing.
And moreover, being of sound mind and body and with just cause wait.
- Strike that.
- Sir, we just - Need you to - state your name.
I'm sorry I had to do that, but I had no other choice.
- I am still a member - of this family, - No matter how hard - you're trying to forget it, And I deserve the right to know what's going on around here.
Malcolm, this does not concern you!
Yes, it does!
There's something - really weird happening - in this house, And all I'm asking is for the courtesy - of not being treated - like an idiot.
- Well, your evil grandmother - is suing us!
Did you hear that?
He called me evil.
I want that on record.
Okay, so she's suing us.
You don't have to keep that from me.
It's horrible, but - everything she does - is horrible.
There's no reason - And your mother - is pregnant.
Pregnant?
!
Are you nuts?
!
- That's the dumbest thing - I've ever heard!
How could you do that to me, to all of us?
!
- What the hell - were you thinking?
!
-  - All clear?
- I kept them out - as long as I could, But $10 doesn't buy a whole lot of mini-golf.
- You knew about this - and didn't tell us?
- Tell us what?
-  Oh, it's here!
Maybe we should take a five-minute break.
I don't pay for breaks.
Mom made me promise not to tell you.
For some reason, she was trying to protect Grandma.
- What does Grandma have to do - with Mom being pregnant?
-  - What, you're pregnant?
No!
- You're having - another kid?
- What is wrong - with you two?
!
- You don't have enough - problems as it is?
!
I can't believe you boys.
This is the way you react to wonderful news?
!
This is a blessing!
- You should be ashamed - of yourselves!
- Psst.
I need - to talk to you.
What?
- Well, we don't - have to worry - About our insurance - premiums going up.
- They just canceled - our policy.
- What are you - talking about?
- They said something about - too many late payments.
Some kind of loophole.
- So, whatever - your mom gets - We have to pay out - of our own pocket.
Oh, my God!
I have good news.
- You know - how everybody's - Been so depressed - around here lately?
Well, I was thinking.
- What could I do - to cheer everyone up?
And then it hit me.
- It was the most obvious thing - in the world.
I bought us an above-ground swimming pool.
And the best part is - you don't have to pay for it - for six months.
It's a raft with cup holders.
- They're setting the pool up - right now.
Oh, and don't just thank me.
Dewey was in on it, too.
He's lying!
Huh?
Wh-What's going on?
Mom's pregnant.
What?
!
You can't do that!
- Do you know how dangerous it is - to have a baby and a pool?
All right, that's it!
Boys, get to your room right now.
And you, you get that truck out of my backyard.
I can't believe it.
Another baby?
They're nuts!
- None of us gets enough - of anything as it is.
Now we're going to have to split it five ways?
What are you guys complaining about?
All I ever had was being the youngest.
- Now I won't even - have that.
You guys don't get it.
- You're only looking at this - in the short term.
We're screwed for life.
- And I actually had - some potential.
I could have gone to college.
Listen to you guys.
Nice family this kid is going to be born into.
Hey, we're allowed to be upset.
- We're the ones getting left out - while every resource - This family has - is going to our baby brother.
Brother?
How much is she costing me?
- I'm not paying for your - little tart of a girlfriend.
Mother, we need to talk.
Ida, we have no insurance.
We were late on our payments, and they canceled us.
-  - If you don't stop This lawsuit, we'll be ruined, do you understand?
I'm sure you'll manage somehow.
There are agencies.
Welfare.
But who is there to help me, huh?
Nobody.
-  - Mom, Dad, We just want to tell you that we were sorry - for the way we acted - about the baby.
-  - Yeah.
We figured it out.
- Reese and I can double - up in the bed again.
And I could sleep with the baby.
- It'll be fun - having a busy box again.
-  Yeah, and I could - probably send home - 30 bucks a week - to help out.
Thank you, boys.
Hello!
This lawsuit isn't going to go away just 'cause you ignore me.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm out of here.
They have no insurance.
- What do you think, - I'm going to take 40 percent - Of this rundown dump - of a house?
Let me explain something to you.
- This house would fit in my house - as a garage, But then I'd have to park my Porsche in the driveway.
Now, I don't mind tossing innocent people into the street.
I just don't do it for free.
I think I feel well enough to travel.
Francis and Grandma are finally gone, and everything's back to normal.
Well, not exactly normal.
- Dad told us that during - the first trimester of pregnancy - Women sometimes get - a tiny bit hormonal.
-  - Quick, boys!
- Someone left the cap - off the toothpaste!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
- So apparently, - there's a risk - Of extra blood loss - with a cesarean section, But Dr. Howard is pretty sure I can deliver vaginally.
He says I have a nice, thick placenta.
What's a placenta?
Don't tell him.
God!
Why are you boys being so squeamish?
- Come on, Mom.
- It's gross!
- What are you - talking about?
- You should - be grateful.
When you were in my womb, - you were feeding off my placenta - for nine months.
Okay, that's it.
I told you we only needed a medium.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Lois, you're not being fair.
Every year you tell me - what you want for - Valentine's Day every year.
Now, this year you want me to buy you a present without so much as a clue?
- Can we discuss - this later?
- When?
After I've - brought home A gift you hate - that makes me - look like a jackass - And you never - forgive me?
- Here, mint - or original?
- I don't remember - the morning sickness Lasting this long.
- Well, you are - a lot older.
- Honey, you know, - like we all are.
- I mean, that's what happens - Everyone gets older - And older until - they die - And can we get - back to your gift?
- Hal, you're going to have at - least four hours at the mall - While I'm shopping - with the boys.
- You'll find - something.
This isn't fair.
You want to trade?
You want to take - three teenage boys - to the basement sale - At Hanning's - and force them to try on - A year's worth - of school clothes?
No, I'm good.
- Oh, God.
My feet - are so swollen, I'm going to need clown shoes.
I can't believe I'm going through this again.
So, a boy or a girl?
What?
- Oh, come on - Just between us, - Would you rather have - a boy or a girl?
- Hal - Oh, I know, I know.
"As long as it's healthy".
We both know the drill.
But deep down, you must want one more than the other.
- : - Well  I'll get the vacuum.
You broke my Space Fighter!
- Give it!
- You give it!
What is going on here?
He stole my pen!
My favorite pen!
- Look at him - holding it!
- Why is it he always - gets the pen?
I never get the pen!
All I want is the pen!
What is wrong with you boys?
You have a whole drawer full of pens right here.
- Why does he - have to have Everything I want?
!
I never have what I need!
- I don't even have - my own bed!
Why does everything in my life suck?
!
You owe me a new Space Fighter!
Shut up and get your own pen!
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
- Renee, please - don't touch it.
- Mallory, you're being silly.
- It's just a pen.
- I was going to do - homework with it.
- Unless there's - a reason This pen's important to you.
It's stupid.
- No, it isn't, - Mallory.
You can tell her.
- Daisy's right.
- You can tell me.
- How come you never say - what's on your mind?
Yeah, you're always so quiet.
-  - Well This boy dropped it in biology class.
- He chewed on - it a little.
Oh, I am so sorry.
I should have known that.
I hate being dumb.
- If I didn't grow - such great hair, My head would be useless.
- You don't have - to be a genius.
- You're sweet - and thoughtful - And that's - what counts.
Aw.
-  - Wow.
That was the worst fight we've had in months.
Why don't you just die?
!
- Give me my pen!
- I'm warning you Ooh, I'm scared.
What are you gonna do?
- What's the baby - gonna do?
Malcolm!
Malcolm, you can take Reese?
No one's "taking" anybody.
- I can't believe - you boys.
Oh, my God, look at you!
He'd better not need stitches.
- Yeah, like you - weren't begging for it.
-  - Come on!
We got a lot of shopping to do!
Hello.
- Mom!
Great!
- Listen, I need a favor.
I need you to go in the garage.
Under the paint tarps, next to the rat poison, is my old box of Mad Magazines, and the one I need you to find is in the middle stack.
- Francis, - what are you talking about?
I got a $20 bet on whether the cover is "Stagnum P.I." or "Magnum P.U." Francis, I don't have time for this.
Oh, of course you don't 'cause every time - something important - to me comes up  Will you hurry up?
We're going to have park, like, a mile away!
- Why do we have - to go shopping, anyway?
- Because you ruin - everything you own.
New clothes don't just magically appear in your drawers.
Mine do.
Hal, hurry up!
- Why can't you go - shopping without us?
- I'm a medium, - I like blue.
- Go crazy.
- Seriously, Mom, - think about it - You're dragging - us to a place That we don't like, - to buy clothes - we don't care about, - For money you - don't want to spend, - To look nice for - people who hate - Our guts.
-  - And if we go - To the shoe store - Before we look - for jeans, - We can get yogurt - in between.
- Mom, will you help me - pick out earrings?
- No, she's gonna help me - pick out tops.
- You know what - we should do?
- You two take - the first floor, - And we'll take - the second floor, - And we'll meet - every 45 minutes - At the pretzel place - and see what else - We need to get, - and then Girls, girls, calm down.
- We do this, like, - five times a week.
You think you'd be bored by now.
- I know why Mallory wants to meet - at the pretzel place.
That's where Jason McNeil works.
Daisy!
- That's who you have - a crush on?
Jason?
- Maybe.
- Mallory, he has - A mustache.
- You don't want - anything to do With a boy like that.
- You're always so - protective of me.
Come on, Daddy, hurry.
Dad, come on, the mall is calling!
Damn it.
That's enough!
Now, we are going shopping, and that is it!
- I don't even need - new clothes!
- I don't even want - to go the mall!
- Do you want big, - do you want small?
Do you want for you?
- Do you want - for the house?
- Do you want - sincere?
Hal, you know what I like.
Yes, because you've always told me!
For the past five Valentine's Days, - you've asked - for a lawn mower, Bath salts, earrings, a Hibachi, a porcelain cat.
Th-There's no pattern, Lois.
It is madness!
- I'm telling you, - it's madness!
Okay, I'm going to let you do this to yourself.
My feet are killing me.
We're going to hit the food court before the sale.
Fine!
Be that way!
Don't come crying to me when you end up with a pair of puppy oven mitts!
Do you like puppy oven mitts?
!
One salad with light dressing and three grande chili stampedes One with extra onions, one with extra beans and extra onions, and one with extra beans and extra, extra onions.
- You've shot down - my star-pod For the last time, Zoltan.
What you gonna do?
What's the baby gonna do, huh?
Aah!
My lip!
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
It hurts!
I don't want a hat, Hal.
Damn.
- Okay, if one of you boys - wants to get napkins, We can start - Boy, keep the windows - open tonight, 'cause I'm gonna rip the biggest -  hole in - my sweater.
Look at this.
- I think I snagged it - on something.
- I hate when - I ruin my things.
Remember when I was two and I got cake on my jumper?
Don't worry.
- I snagged a - blouse once.
- That's when Mom - taught me how to sew.
Why isn't Daddy back from the pharmacy yet?
- I'll bet he's - sneaking a cigarette.
Now, you girls let him be.
Sometimes he just needs a break.
It's not easy being the only boy in the family.
Oh, look.
- Hi, honey, - we're over here.
Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, girls.
- Sorry it took so long.
- No one's upset with me, - are they?
Bought everyone some cookies.
Oh they're gone.
Daddy, you know how you like to make me happy?
: Yes?
- Well, there - is the cutest - Little makeup kit at - the Clinique counter.
Oh, honey, no.
Now, absolutely not.
I don't even like you wearing makeup, - and that stuff - is so overpriced.
- And what's - such a hurry?
Hal, it's all right.
Mallory, stop manipulating your father.
You know there's no sport in it.
- She wants to look pretty - for Jason.
Who's Jason?
- Daddy, keep - your voice down.
He's right over there.
God, I can't believe you.
I don't know what you see in that guy.
Daddy, don't you think - Mallory should be - with someone else?
- No.
- Well, that's easy - For you to say.
- You have, like, - 50 guys after you.
All right, girls, that's enough.
Now, Renee, I know you love your sister, but you can't live her life for her.
And, Mallory, - I know you want to look older - and more sophisticated, But trust me that three-dollar lip gloss is working just fine.
You're right, Mom.
You're always right.
-  Hey, I was - gonna eat that!
-  - Tough luck!
-  - What the hell's wrong with you?
!
No.
Damn.
Can I help you?
Don't do it.
Thank you.
- All right, - we're going in.
- You see anything in your size, - grab it and hold on to it, - No matter what anyone - tries to do to you.
- Protect your heads.
- Don't trust anyone.
- What are you trying to do, - scare us?
Yes.
Fear is good.
It's an 80%-off sale.
Fear will keep you alive.
Don't worry.
We're with Malcolm.
Ooh.
Oh Oh, the foot spa.
Those are good, right?
Oh, yeah, they're amazing.
I already have two.
- This one's for - my downstairs bathroom.
Well, enjoy.
I would like the deluxe foot spa with remote control, - and I'd like it gift-wrapped, - please.
- I'm sorry.
- That was our last one.
No!
Well, what about the one in the window?
It's a display model.
It's just a shell.
But you have to I need the the perfect My wife Sir!
Sir!
Excuse me.
Hi.
I'm Hal, remember?
- Your friend from - just now in the store.
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi.
I was trying to get one of those foot spas for my wife.
Oh, really?
Yeah, my pregnant wife.
For Valentine's Day, you know.
And apparently, you bought the last one.
So, I was wondering, since you already have two, uh, if you wouldn't mind selling me that one.
No, I don't think so.
Sorry.
Look, you don't understand.
I have been searching and searching.
- I'll give you double - what you paid for.
No!
I'll give you triple.
Look, I'm sorry, but no.
This is mine.
I bought it.
- I'm sure if you just - keep looking around, You'll find something else.
Oh, okay, okay.
Um, ah, how about this?
I can see through that old lady's bra.
We've got to get out of here before we're scarred for life.
Come on.
Hey, Mom, we've - You did not already - try on those clothes.
And you do not have a term paper due, and you are not - going to suddenly - develop stomach cramps.
- How did you?
- Please, who do you think You're talking to?
- Now, go, try on - those clothes.
Reese.
- Takes these and go - with your brother.
Mom, what are you doing?
- Why are you giving me - a pink shirt?
- I don't wear pink.
- I've never worn pink.
That shirt is red.
- If you have something to say, - just come out and say it.
For the love of God, I'll find you another one.
Excuse me.
Wow, what happened to your face?
I slept on it wrong.
What do you mean?
Well, I'm sleeping like this, - and then my knee went - up into my elbow, And my elbow hit my hand and it went in my mouth, and no one hit me, okay?
I don't want to hear any more of your whining.
You try this on right now, understood?
!
-  Why are you - standing here?
You're wasting time.
- I'm not changing out here - in front of everybody.
- You know what?
- I don't even need new clothes.
- I'll just live off the lost - and found at school.
- It's all better - than this crap anyway.
Mom, Mom, there you are.
Look, it's a $200 dress they marked down to $30.
- Oh, my God.
- This is like a dream.
- Mom, you will not - believe this.
- I had Daisy - dig through the cabinets - Under the sales table, - and we found all this stuff - They were saving to put out - for tomorrow.
- Yeah, we've got all the clothes - we need for the whole year.
Good work, girls.
Uh-oh, look who's here.
- You know, I wouldn't - be insulted if you wanted - To go for an ice cream - with him.
Maybe later.
- This is our - special day, Mom.
- Yeah, and we haven't even gotten - to the best part yet.
- When we help find things - for you.
I can't really describe him.
- He was just - an average-looking guy, - But he had - kind of crazy eyes.
Is that helpful?
Sir, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what came over me earlier.
- I'm really not - that kind of person.
I-I just think it was all the pressure of Valentine's Day, and I was so upset and irrational.
But the bottom line is that I made a mistake and grabbed the wrong bag!
Oh, God    - Look at him.
- Yeah.
I assume you'll want the same deal I had with him.
- What are you - talking about?
Look, Reese is as good as dead, at least on the inside.
That puts you in charge.
You get half my candy, full control of the remote, - and since I can't do - your homework for you, How about a nice warm towel - whenever you come out - of the shower?
- Will you shut up?
- He's going to be fine.
Whatever you say sir.
Come on.
Hey.
I'm sorry, I was here first.
No, you weren't.
We're next.
I'll only take a minute.
I've only got two things to try on.
- Lady, we've been waiting - in line for a half hour.
We have to meet our mom.
I'm sorry, but we're next.
Back off, brat!
- This may be - your first sale, But it isn't mine!
Let him go.
It's our turn.
Looks like you need someone - to teach you - to mind your elders.
You looking for a dance partner?
You think you can do whatever you want, don't you?
- That people - aren't going to say Or do anything because you're "frail".
Deal's off.
All right, Reese is back.
You want to take your teeth out before we start this, Grandma?
Oh, no, Reese is back.
Hi, I'm Karen Tracy.
- I was speaking to one - of your boys earlier.
Oh, my God, I'll kill him.
See, these kind of outbursts - are exactly the sort of thing - we can help you with.
- I'm with the Department - of Child Services.
- What?
What are you - talking about?
- Look, we're not making - any judgments yet, But the department takes - the safety of children - very seriously.
- I'd like you to come in - for an evaluation.
What's the last known address of the boy's father?
Wait a minute.
This is a mistake.
My boys are fine.
- It wasn't me - Somebody planted Those teeth on me.
These your kids?
- I was just trying - to buy a slip, - And they all jumped - on me like jackals.
-  - She's lying.
- We were just trying - to pull Reese off of her.
Oh, Lois, thank God I found you.
- Look, we got to get - out of here before  Run!
Mom, seriously, get the lead out!
You must be so happy.
You wouldn't believe some of the families I have to deal with.
Oh, girls.
Hurry up.
It's our turn at the register.
- I can't decide between the - peach, the melon or the salmon.
- I just have to - get all three.
No, honey, now you're going to make a choice.
- Gee, Mom, if you're - going to force me - To wear knock-offs, - can I at least - Just get - what I want?
Here you go, sweetie.
- Here's the makeup - you wanted.
- Oh, thank you - so much, Daddy.
Hal, what are you doing?
We said she couldn't have that.
Well, she asked me again - and told me that you said - it would be okay after all, - And then, you know, - she started Getting all teary-eyed.
You know, I I-I just I Mallory, how could you do that?
- Don't worry, Mom.
I won't - wear it around the house.
- I know how desperate you are - to be the prettiest.
- Mallory, I think we're all - getting a little bit frazzled.
Why don't we talk about this when - we're modeling our clothes - for each other at home.
- Yeah, that's - really good, Mom, Because by that time the buzz from her diet pills will have worn off.
Diet pills?
- I have a slow - metabolism, okay?
- And I don't burn up calories - having sex with a different boy Every night down by the creek.
I thought you were at band practice every night.
There is no band!
Shut up, flatsy patsy, you don't know anything.
I know you're pregnant.
- She is lying.
- That is ridiculous.
- I am not pregnant, - because I know - That sex is wrong - and immoral and fun.
No, wait It's all right, Renee.
- It's good - that they know.
I'm ready for teenage marriage.
It'll be awesome.
He's the father?
You only slept with him - because you knew - that I liked him!
- Maybe you should have asked - to use my hair brush first.
Girls, please, can you just?
Girls, don't do this.
You're supposed to be easy.
- No, Mom, - you're easy.
-  We can fool you - about anything.
We're girls.
We know how you think.
And we're not above using it.
Mom, Dad, hi.
- Francis, - what are you doing here?
- You're supposed to be - away at college.
I dropped out, but don't worry, I'm working.
At the new Hooters out by the lumberyard.
With tips, I can pay rent on the trailer - and still keep - my husband in beer.
Hey, got to go.
- Cockfight starts - in half an hour.
- You still got to load - the cages into my pickup.
- Uh, you know, you could - talk to my daughter Leave him alone!
You never like any of my husbands.
- You've always tried - to come between us, And that's why I hate you!
Ever since you lost all that weight, - nothing is ever - good enough for you!
This isn't right.
Girls don't do these things.
Girls are nicer.
Girls are better.
Oh, come off it.
- Who do you think - made us this way?
It's all your fault.
Honey, come on, you can do it.
It's just another 300 yards after SeÃ±or Jelly Bean's.
- Trust me, Hal.
- There's no escape.
There's no escape no matter what.
Happy Valentine's Day, honey.
It finally came to me last night.
The perfect gift.
And I know you'll love it because it's not for you.
Thank you, Hal.
It's perfect.
- Come on, Dad, - let's go.
Oh, I get Malcolm.
Wait, we almost forgot the thing.
- Happy Valentine's - Day, Mom.
Yeah, happy Valentine's Day.
-  We saved you - the coconut ones - 'cause we know - they're you're favorite.
Thank you, boys.
I love it.
See you in a bit.
I hope you're a girl.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
- I can't believe - we're locked out.
- Mom won't be home - until 6:00.
- Hang on.
I know - how to get in.
Here it is.
I'll do it.
Thanks.
That credit card thing takes hours.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
- Why do you have to take - your pillow to your sister's?
- Well, Hal, I don't know how long - I'm going to be there.
I want to be comfortable.
- Well, what am I supposed - to sniff while you're gone?
- Mom's baby doctor - is making her move - To her sister's house - for a while.
- Dad's starting - to get used to it.
At least now he goes out to the garage to cry.
Aha!
No coaster.
Look at that ring.
That is why I have to move out of this house.
Mom.
- Every time you boys - thoughtlessly Mar the furniture by refusing to use coasters, what are you doing?
Killing the baby.
Killing the baby.
Every time you run through the house, - every time - you destroy furniture, - Every time - you fight with each other, You are killing the baby.
- Lois, the doctor - just said You should avoid stress.
Which is just medical jargon for the simple fact that every time you boys misbehave, - you might as well - be taking a knife - And putting it in that baby's - tiny little heart.
- Will you stop - saying that?
- I just hope - you boys have the character - To channel the horrible guilt - you should be feeling - Into better behavior - while I'm gone.
- We're sorry.
- Okay.
- Yes, Mom.
Oh, my God.
- I don't think - I can keep this up.
- It's just a few more days - until she leaves.
We can laugh all we want - when she's backing out - of the driveway.
We're not really hurting the baby, are we?
- Please.
A week - before you were born, - We tied our playpen - to the back of her car - And followed - her to work.
She's just trying to save face.
- She doesn't - want to admit - That we actually drove her - from the house.
- And now we're - in charge.
Helga, this cheese is magnificent.
Would you like to try just a little bite?
No?
How could you not like cheese?
It is made from something that comes from you.
Hey, Otto.
Ooh.
Francis.
- Have you seen - Helga's squeaky toy?
It's the one that looks like a little fire hydrant.
No, but I did get in the new branding iron.
Shh.
Do you want to scare the poor thing out of her wits?
- Otto, I know how much - you love Helga, But we have to do this.
All the cows have to get branded and de-wormed.
I promise I will be very careful.
But don't tell her about it.
- You know, she is not as brave - as she looks.
I told her one ghost story around the campfire, and she had to sleep between me and Gretchen for a week.
And I don't give a damn About a greenback-a dollar Greenback dollar Spend it fast as I can As fast as I can For a wailin' song and a good guitar The only things that I understand Poor boy The only things That I understand.
- Yes!
- All right!
That little elbow move - you added where did you - come up with that?
- You got me.
- I was in the zone.
-  - All right, all right.
Can we get back to work?
What?
That was perfect.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Come on.
Really?
Was it so perfect - that you are ready - to go up on stage with it - At the Elks Club - Founders Dinner?
What did you say?
I've been waiting to tell you.
I got us the gig!
Impossible!
- They haven't taken - a new act in years.
- It's easier to get - on the waiting list For a new heart.
I know, but this morning at the gas station, I saw Eddie Eigen.
He come up to me to say hi, and he slipped on an oil stain.
He can't perform.
- You're kidding.
- No, I tell you, It's like God backed up that minivan over his ventriloquist hand.
So, Eddie uses my cell phone to cancel with the club.
Two minutes later, I push redial and got us the gig.
You are the man.
-  - I cannot believe - You don't trust me, Daddy.
I am not seeing Malcolm!
I don't even like him.
- I haven't talked to him - in over a month.
Nicki's such a good liar.
That's good in a girlfriend, right?
He is such a jerk.
I can't believe he's making us hang out in closets.
Once my mom's gone, - we can hang out at - my house after school.
Thank God.
I can't get away with anything here.
- You were with that girl, - weren't you?
- No!
I was at the library - studying.
-  - You were supposed - To pick your brother up - at school.
There were rocks.
There was a beehive.
But where were you?
- You are not allowed - to see that girl.
Her name is Nicki, and I'm not seeing her.
Every time you lie to me, it is like you are digging a tiny little grave.
I am not lying to you!
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
You know, Mom, you're looking lovely today.
People don't appreciate - how lovely you can be - in the right light.
- I'm always telling kids - at school - That I have - the loveliest mother.
I'll put on the coffee.
It's Henson.
Make decaf.
-  - "A Day in Prison"?
We have no choice.
- I am not leaving you here - with Reese like this.
It just sounds so scary.
That's the point.
You take them to prison, - a bunch of criminals scream - at them, And they come home good.
Hey, they include a snack.
There you go, Helga.
Almost done.
How's it going?
- Just finishing - the de-worming.
God, these fumes are horrible.
- All right, - let's get this over with.
- Wait a minute.
- You didn't brand them first?
No.
Why?
That'd be the main reason.
-  - Wow!
The Founders Dinner.
- Three hours from now, - we'll be singing on that stage.
In the dessert slot!
You can't beat that.
No, you can't.
Big time.
- Dewey, I have - to focus, - So I want you to sit - and watch quietly Right over here.
Why do I have to be here?
- Why couldn't I go snowboarding - with Reese?
- Reese isn't - snowboarding.
- That was just a lie - Mommy and Daddy told.
Reese is in jail.
For how long?
A few hours.
Oh.
Since there was no contraband found on or inside your bodies, - I think - you're ready To meet some of the inmates now.
This is Samuel.
- I would tell you - what he's in here for, But it's against the law for me to say it to minors.
Be with you in a minute.
The ankles were a bit unnecessarily tight.
All right, so we need - to get a few of - the ground rules Straight.
I own you!
- You are my - property!
And you should know, I don't take very good care of my things.
Stand up.
: I said stand up!
Turn around!
All the way.
Faster!
See that?
Like a little top.
Sit down!
See how that works?
'Cause in prison, you got to make your own fun.
And when they toss in punk kids like you and you, whoo It's like Christmas for me!
If you displease me, I will not hesitate to grab you by your pretty little neck, just squeeze till your eyes bulge out of your head, and then pop them with a fork.
You think that's funny?
I thought you were trying to be funny.
So, I got me a volunteer, huh?
- Well, let me tell - you, cupcakes, What your first day up in here gonna be like!
And don't expect no flowers afterwards.
Malcolm, we have to go!
I'm sorry, Nicki.
- I've got to help my mom - drop off the first load - Of her stuff - at my aunt's house.
- There and back is like - three hours, - But when I get home, - I'll sneak over.
Malcolm!
What were you doing in there?
Finishing up my homework.
Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square station Every day at quarter past two And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich : As the train comes rumblin' through Whoo!
Whoo!
But did he ever return?
No, he'll never return And his fate is still unlearned He may ride forever He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston He's the man who never returned Play that banjo, Steve-o  Yeehaw!
Yip, yip, yeehaw!
A-ha Or else he'll never return No, he'll never return And his fate is still unlearned Just like Paul Revere - He may ride forever - 'neath the streets of Boston He's the man who never returned He's the man who never returned.
So, what'd you think, Dewey?
- It's cool.
- It's fun the way you guys move.
- Yeah.
- How come you're always - in the back?
I'm not always in the Well, even if I am, it-it's not about where anyone is.
- It's about what's - best for the group.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Why is it best for the group to put you in the back?
So, a three-hour drive.
Should be nice.
Uh-huh.
- We don't get - to be alone - That often anymore, - just the two of us, - And I've been wanting - to talk to you.
- What are we going to talk about - for three hours?
Sex.
Mom, don't do this!
Malcolm, in a few days, - I'm going to be gone - for a very long time, - And I need to know - that you're okay.
We are going to have this talk.
I know about you and Nicki.
I'm not seeing Nicki!
I'm not having sex!
I know about protection!
I know all that stuff!
Malcolm, there's a lot more - to being a sexually - responsible person - Than what they teach - you in health class.
- It's very different when you're - experiencing it yourself.
Mom, stop.
I'll do anything you ask.
Just don't have this conversation.
Oh, honey, it's going to happen.
- : - No.
You think I like it?
- You think I like - the embarrassment - We're going to be feeling - for the next few hours?
- But, Malcolm, - I have no choice.
- I cannot be there when - you are having sex.
God!
So I'm going to try to give you - the benefit of - my experience.
I'm going to bury you with every piece of information I have.
I don't know what will be helpful and what won't, - so I'm just going to - tell you everything.
Oh, my God!
- The sooner we start, - the sooner it'll be over with.
Now, this is a diaphragm.
- Look, Otto keeps asking me - where Helga is, - And I'm running - out of excuses.
- You got to tell - him what happened.
- I know.
- I'm working on it.
It's just a cow.
A cow that's in his will.
- Francis, I've got to thank you - for what you did to Helga.
- My budget is - really tight, - And getting a couple - of extra sides of beef Really helped me out.
: And how did you achieve that smoky flavor?
That's great stuff, Arnold.
- Ray's dad - has a week to live.
- Maybe you can do - ten minutes on that.
Otto, I have to tell you something.
Francis, have you seen Helga?
No, I haven't.
It is not like her to wander off alone.
- I'm starting - to get scared.
Mmm!
This is delicious.
Do you think she ran away because she was angry with me?
I don't think so.
Well, I should have been there when you branded her.
- I could have held - her little hoof.
So tender, so moist.
You must try some.
Mm-hmm.
Look at me, enjoying myself while my Helga is out there, alone and scared.
That is it.
- I will go, and I - will look for her, And I will find her, if I have to spend all night searching!
- Otto, if I don't say this - right now, I am never going to say it.
Yes, go ahead.
- Pass the bÃ©arnaise - sauce, please.
- FRANCIS : - Helga!
Helga, meine Liebchen!
Helga!
- All that crap you "tough" - guys have been pulling, Well, this is where it's got you!
This is Are you paying attention?
!
No.
I just realized.
You're in prison.
- You're locked up in here - for life.
What do I need to be afraid of you for?
Because the way you've been screwing up, you're likely to end up in here, and when that happens, whoo-wee!
- You know, Sammy, - you might want to have someone - Smuggle some mouthwash - in a cake.
Let me tell you what happened to the last guy who made fun of me.
They found just enough of him to convict me!
- Ooh!
I am so scared - of prison boy.
What are you going to do, stretch out your arms to my house?
- And if the sperm - doesn't take, - The uterine wall - sloughs off cells, - And that's what - creates a period.
- Women can be very - emotional at that time, - But God help you - if you point it out - Because then you're - creating two problems Me-may-ma-mo- me-may-ma-mo-moo Me-may-ma-mo-me- may-ma-mo-moo - I hope I don't get - too nervous tonight.
- Kitty bought a new - antiperspirant I don't have much confidence in.
No one will even notice if I sweat.
- Since I'm  - in the back the whole time.
I'm in the back for every song, you know.
And frankly, I don't think that's fair.
We all agreed on the choreography, Hal.
- Where is this - coming from?
From the back, that's where!
You have such a good voice.
Why don't you ever sing lead?
I don't know.
I was told I sound a little throaty in my upper register.
Are you the leader?
Well, there's no leader.
We make all our decisions as a group.
- I don't remember any "group" - vote on these sweaters.
- Hey, we all agreed - on these sweaters!
- You like these sweaters, - don't you?
Yes, I do.
What's he going to say?
- "My brother-in-law, - who's the only reason - "I'm in the group - in the first place, Picked out ugly sweaters"?
!
- Excuse me?
!
- Dewey, - What do you think - of these sweaters?
I like them.
They're funny.
Oh, see?
!
- We're going to look - ridiculous tonight!
-  - Well, it doesn't matter How I look.
No one's going to be able to see me!
Oh, for heaven's sake!
- Maybe if you guys worried - more about your voices - And less about - your sweaters - Oh, now you're - criticizing my singing?
!
- Puh-lease.
You - can't say your name Without changing keys.
- I think Malik - sings beautifully!
Of course you do.
You're tone deaf!
- Well, at least - when I dance, - It doesn't look like - I hooked my butt up To a paint mixer!
Oh!
Oh, that's it!
- You can go up here - without me tonight!
I won't be here either!
Neither will I!
Me, neither!
- I don't know why - it took so long - For the scales - to fall from my eyes!
And to reveal you as you really are!
- And believe me, it's - a lot more sensitive - Than most men - understand.
- A little bit - goes a long way.
Helga!
Oh, we will never find her!
And it's all my fault!
No, Otto, it's not.
It's my fault.
I have to tell you this.
There was an accident, a tragic branding accident.
- I killed Helga, - and I fed her to you, And I couldn't be more sorry.
What?
She's gone.
She's dead.
I don't think she suffered.
- I'm sorry.
- I-I should have told you Right from the beginning, but I couldn't.
Let me tell you something.
You are the only boss I've ever had in my life - that I actually liked, - and what's weird is, You're the only one I've ever lied to.
I just couldn't stand the thought of hurting you.
Thank you for telling me the truth.
If you want to fire me, feel free.
Oh, no, no, no.
It was an accident.
I think we should try to put it all behind us.
I don't deserve a boss like you.
Let us go home.
Oh, Francis, there is an expression that you used that I am unfamiliar with.
What does it mean when you say "fed her to you"?
- : - Okay.
- So, on the night - I lost my virginity, - I learned something - very important - About relationships - and trust.
Your body can be telling you to do something I hope you all appreciate what those men were doing for you.
- And you might be happy to hear - that in part Because of the fine work Samuel's done with this program, he's getting paroled next week.
Hey, I don't care if you get out!
You'll never figure out how to find me.
Jackass.
And people, they hop from one person to another trying to get some sense of validation.
- They do this all - through college, - All through - their twenties, - Having all sorts - of casual encounters.
- And sometimes they - even convince themselves - That the relationship - is serious - Because the sex is - so great, but that Wait.
Stop.
- What did you mean - by validation?
Validating what?
Well, sometimes people will attract other people just to prove to themselves that they're likable.
And if that's the reason that you're having sex with someone, - you can cause - a lot of damage.
- But if you want - to have sex with someone, - Doesn't that mean - you really like them?
Oh, no, honey.
That's exactly the trap people fall into.
You see, a lot of people   That was cool.
How comes he doesn't dance as fast as you?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said anything before.
Mm-hmm!
This is our shot!
We can't blow it like this.
- The whole point of - the Gentlemen Callers Was to have fun and help Malik tone down his drinking.
We're friends!
- I don't even know - why we're fighting.
- Ladies and gentlemen, - I'd like to introduce an act - We haven't seen before - at the Founders Dinner.
Simmer down.
Now let's give a warm welcome to the Gentlemen Callers!
Well, I for one, am a Gentleman Caller.
Uh, well, th-thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
The six of us couldn't be more honored to be here, - and we're going to sing - a little song about brotherhood.
And forgiveness.
And friendship.
Whoo-hoo!
Play that banjo, Steve-o Yeehaw!
Now all night long Charlie rides through the station Crying, "What will become of me?
How can I afford to see My sister in Chelsea?
: Or my cousin in Roxbury But did he ever return?
No, he never returned And his fate is still unlearned Fame and scandal He will ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston He's the man who never returned He's the man who never returned.
: They loved us!
- We got more applause - that the Whistling Whittlers!
Yeah.
- Now everyone over to my house - for pizza!
How come you always go to his house?
Sometimes after a fight, - you feel closer than you feel - when you're getting along.
Can I ask you something else?
Sure.
Well, sometimes when I'm with Nicki, I have this feeling - that she wants to be doing - something else, But I don't know what it is.
Then I try to guess.
- Oh, that's never good.
- Yeah, suddenly it's like - I did something wrong, - but I was just trying to help.
- I mean, what am I supposed - to do?
Just sit there
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Here we go!
Yes!
I win!
I win!
I finally beat you in a video game.
In your face, Malcolm.
In your face.
- Dad, Dad - Yes!
The goal of Video Golf is to get the fewest points.
Oh Nice game.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now - You're not - the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
-  Give it!
-  No way.
-  Okay, I'm going - to do a load of colors, Then a load of whites, so if you have any clothes in your room you want Craig's been over here every day helping out with the chores since Mom went to her sister's.
It was two weeks before we figured out nobody asked him.
So Dad's in charge.
Ow!
- Boys, quit horsing around - and eat your dinner.
Ah!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Stop it!
Stop!
- Now we are at - zero tolerance now!
Do you hear me?
Zero tolerance!
You boys have got to learn to behave!
From now on - Who wants more - mac and cheese?
- All right.
Move it.
- Yeah.
Me first.
That is it!
Sit down!
- Just because your mother - isn't here Is no excuse to misbehave.
Now when I say zero tolerance, I mean zero tolerance.
Tolerance to the zero degree.
I'm talking zip, nada, zilch.
In terms of tolerance.
-  - I'll get it.
- Malcolm - Hello.
We are having a discussion.
It's Stevie, he needs help with his math homework.
Go.
- So if your want to derive wave - maps in two space dimensions, You have to make sure - you're talking about - equivariant wave maps or else You can't keep calling me here.
I was guessing that you'd get to the phone first.
- Nicki, if my parents figure out - we're still going out, I'll get totally nailed.
- Then we'll never - get to see each other.
- I know it's hard, - but we have to be more careful.
- Well, I'm bored, - and my dad's gone for a while.
I'll be right over.
Okay, that is it!
We are at zero tolerance now.
Zero tolerance!
That's the night that the lights went out In Georgia That's the night that they hung an innocent man Well, don't trust your soul - To no backwoods - Southern lawyer 'Cause the judge in the town's Got bloodstains on his hands Bloody, bloody hands.
Yeah!
Fantastic.
Once again you two have blown off my socks.
Francis, meet my nephew, Willy.
He doesn't speak English.
Hello.
Willy will be staying with us until his work visa gets straightened out.
-  - Until then We will get to hear his wonderful playing every day, no?
- Otto, let's get - our sheet music.
We can do our duet of - "Don't Go Breaking - My Heart".
Ja.
It is not so much a song as it is a lovers' conversation.
Come.
So - how do you like - America?
Well nice to meet you.
-  - It's so weird at my house.
- Nobody ever - answers the phone.
My brothers are seeing who can go the longest - without changing - their underwear.
- I never thought - I'd miss my mom.
I still don't, but I'm getting close.
Well, it sounds like a drag, but at least it's going to be over in a month or two.
- Oh, by the way, did I - tell you that my dad's - Going to bring Trish - to my birthday party?
Who's Trish?
Trish the woman that my dad has been seeing for the past four months who totally hates me.
- Malcolm, - I told you about her.
Did I tell you my dad has taken away all my CDs?
- He says it's because - I play them too loud, - But I'm pretty - sure I heard him - Listening to them - in the garage.
Malcolm, do you think for, like, once, we could talk about my problems?
Oh.
Okay, sure.
Well, what are they?
What are they?
I've been sitting here -  - Nicki?
Were you talking to someone?
Yeah, it's my secret boyfriend.
He's hiding under the bed.
- Don't you - want to check?
Why does everything have to be a snotty remark with you?
Well, according to Trish, it's the "normal reaction" for not being the only girl in my daddy's life anymore.
Come on, Nicki, she was being nice.
- Well, it's none of her business - how I feel about anything.
She's not my mom.
Nobody said anything about her being your mom.
Maybe it's time we talked this out.
- Okay, what do you - want to talk about?
- How much Trish - hates me?
- You're not going to pick - a fight to get out of this.
We're going to hash this out if we have to sit here all night.
-  - Boys - Boys, come on, - let's be reasonable.
- This is no way - to treat your father.
What kind of father are you?
You're nothing but a joke, and you're weak.
- Oh, man, are you going - to pay for that When your mother gets home!
You still think Mom's coming back after the way you screwed things up?
- Dewey, what - do you think You're doing?
- I'm lighting - Dad on fire.
No way.
I get to do it.
We'll all do it.
Oh, my God, honey.
I just had the worst dream.
The boys just I-I lost control of them, and-and you were never coming home and It was just awful.
It's okay, sweetie.
Go back to sleep.
We'll spoon, okay?
Okay.
- How come she's - allowed to be naked - On the kitchen table, - and I'm not?
Dewey, if a cop - tells you to do something, - you do it.
What are you boys doing?
I told you to go to bed hours ago.
Actually, Dad, your exact words were just, "Go to bed".
You didn't say, "Go to bed now".
- If you leave us - a loophole like that, - I don't see how - this could be our fault.
- You have disrespected - my authority for the last time!
I'm at zero tolerance!
I keep thinking that at some point I might be able to trust you boys - to do as you're told, - but I can't.
- Well, there are going to be - some big changes around here.
Very big changes.
Now get to bed!
Uh, wait.
Um could you repeat that?
My mind kind of wandered toward the end.
- Don't push it, Reese.
- You know very well what I   Hi, Dad.
What are you?
Have you been out all night?
- Trust me, it wasn't my idea - to be out this late.
I suppose you were being held prisoner somewhere.
I got home as quickly as I could.
And besides, - what are Reese and Dewey - still doing up?
Don't change the subject.
You crossed the line, mister.
And until further notice, there will be no TV, no computer and no video games because I am at zero tolerance with you boys!
Is that understood?
!
Zero tolerance!
What?
Did you just roll your eyes at me?
- As long as you are - living in this house, I demand your respect!
For what?
This house is a pigsty.
Everything in the fridge has expired.
- I found a piece of cake - in the shower.
-  - That's mine.
- And now you're screaming at me - because you can't control them, And you know what?
- I'm sick of it.
- Oh, well, if that's The way you feel, you know where the door is.
I do know where the door is, and I know how to use it!
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Everyone's a little upset -  - Then go ahead - And use it!
- See if I care!
Just turn the knob and pull.
- Oh, I'll turn - the knob and pull.
Just watch me!
Turning and pulling!
I'm watching, but I don't see you doing it.
I am doing it.
Turn.
Pull.
And now I'm outside!
Congratulations!
- Would you like me - to close the door?
Yes, close the damn door!
Thank you!
Here comes the tearful apology.
Three two one.
So exactly how many militias is your dad in?
- These are all - of his Armageddon supplies - For when the U.N. takes over - the banks.
Anyways, thanks for hiding me.
- I don't know where else - I could've gone - Without somebody's parents - turning me in.
- Well, I'm gonna get some sleep.
- I'll bring you a snack In the morning.
You know, - this is actually going - to be pretty cool, Having you hiding up here right over my bedroom.
You're like my little secret.
Help yourself to some snacks.
- Just be careful - of the trip wire.
There's darts tipped with - Just be careful - of the trip wire.
- You kicked him out - of the house?
Oh, please.
He kicked himself out of the house, Craig.
Look, I've been through this before with Reese and Francis.
It never lasts long.
- When Reese was kicked out, - he spent the night on the roof Until he got into a fight with a pack of cats.
So that makes it okay that Malcolm spent the night - sleeping on a booze- - soaked mattress - In some dark alley?
- Craig - Oh, my God!
He's - probably dead by now!
- Malcolm can take care - of himself.
- You're right, you're right.
He's - a genius, which would make him Even more attractive to rogue elements in our secret weapons programs.
How long before - some government scientist - picks him up And tries to surgically attach him to some animal?
Stop playing.
No more piano.
No pi-a-no!
Just stop playing!
Ich verstehe nicht.
-  - You let me know If you hear anything at all.
- Oh, my God, he's been - gone for over a day.
Where the hell is he?
!
Keep it down!
The neighbors don't have to know our business.
How can you be smiling right now?
- Because I just realized - We have a free pass.
What do you mean?
- Can't you see how - guilty Dad feels?
He's not going to punish anybody else for a while.
We're bulletproof.
What are you going to do?
I'm not sure yet.
This is a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity.
It's got to be perfect and huge.
I want this to be a statement about everything I stand for.
Okay, watch this.
- Okay, I don't know - what happened I know what happened.
You have been riding those horses too much.
We have an ointment, Francis.
- You put it - on your leistengegend, And it will be as good as new.
-  - It's good stuff, - Francis.
It's tingly.
- Ja.
- Come on.
- Excuse me.
- What?
Uh, your poster, it's distracting people from my poster, and mine was there first.
So?
It's not your tree.
Look, I-I'm sure that your dog Milton Is very sweet and you love him very much, but I'm looking for my son.
An actual human being - who's been missing - for two days.
Now don't you think finding a lost person - is more important than - finding a lost dog?
I don't know your kid, but from the way my mom and dad talk, your whole family isn't worth as much as my dog.
You li  What's your name?
- Patrick.
- Patrick.
Let me tell you - a little something - about your dog.
He's gone, see?
- Some other family - has taken him in.
- And right now - that family Is pampering Milton in ways you never even dreamed of.
- So your dog - already loves them A lot more than he ever loved you.
- And if you ever - did get him back, Oh, he would just resent you - until he found some - way to escape again.
So, why don't you just take the poster down, okay?
Take your poster down.
Your kid's probably in a crack house.
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Hey.
I brought you some food.
- I can't believe I'm being - forced to live in an attic, - Living off someone else's - table scraps.
- Do you mind if I sit with you - for a little bit?
- I'm really pissed - at my dad right now.
- You're pissed - at your dad?
!
Could you listen for a sec?
- My dad just told me - that he's dragging me On some camping trip with him and Trish.
I can't spend an entire weekend in a tent with that woman.
He provoked the whole thing.
- He could've stopped - me from walking out - Of the door if he'd - really wanted to.
- Malcolm, I think it would be - a really good idea If you would listen to me right now, do you understand?
- If you listen - to what I'm saying, - Then you can give it - some thought.
And then we can talk it out - in a way that's going - to help me.
- And then I can do the same - for you.
Then we could have - a conversation - that actually matters.
- No!
- He had to act like a big man.
What was he trying to prove?
That's it.
That's what?
I can't take this anymore.
You are the most selfish, thoughtless person that I have ever seen.
From now on, I am not your girlfriend.
You're breaking up with me?
You have killed everything I have ever felt for you.
It's over!
But, but what am I going to do?
- I never want to - see you again!
HAL : Just come home, Malcolm.
If you want me to apologize, I will.
I was wrong, and you - were totally right - about everything.
Geez, Dad, hold something back.
Who cares what started all this?
It doesn't matter.
I just want you back because you're my son.
And you're the only one in this family who has a chance - of amounting to anything.
- What?
: It's not true, son.
I was just trying to  I'm just trying to get Malcolm home.
- Ignore that last part, Malcolm.
- You're our only hope.
- Please, come home.
- I love you.
So my dad kicked me out of the house, then Nicki broke up with me.
- I don't know how long ago - it was.
I can't remember if these mean hours or days.
That's Nicki.
Did you hear that?
That's her talking.
What's she laughing about?
She can't be laughing.
She's not laughing, she's crying.
Just like my dad.
They're all suffering now.
Okay, Willy, here goes.
I know you are trying to be friendly, but what your armchair are doing is make me feel bad.
Crybaby bastard.
No, I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.
I'm not going to get mad.
Okay, Willy, you want it, you got it!
Come on, Willy!
Make some music to this!
Where's your music now, Willy?
!
Where's your music now?
!
He was playing music while I did stuff.
Okay, maybe Nicki could have at least left me a paper cup or something up here.
: I just wish she'd come back to say hello.
I miss talking to her.
I was going to be her little secret.
She's so incredible.
I can't believe she ever liked me.
I had Nicki and I had a family.
What happened?
How did it ever get like this?
My God, I'm horrible.
- No wonder my dad kicked me out - of the house.
I'm annoying and selfish.
Nicki and my family are lucky.
At least they get to get away from me.
I'm stuck here with myself.
Wait a second.
I don't have to be like this.
I can change.
I can totally change.
From now on, I'll just listen to what people say.
I'll be friendly.
I'll be considerate.
- : - Yeah.
Yeah, I like this new Malcolm.
That's her.
What's she talking about?
That's a guy's voice.
There's a guy in her room.
A guy in her room!
-  - I am telling you He is not here!
-  - This moment has been A long time coming.
The fruit of over two hours of planning and labor.
Thank you.
Try as I might, I just can't find a flaw in this plan.
Behold!
- Turn it off!
- Turn it off!
Stop it!
Dewey, aah!
Dewey!
Guys, come back!
For the love of God, help me!
Stop it!
-  - Reese, What are you doing?
Whoa  Help!
Oh, why me?
Welcome home, son.
Thanks, Dad.
Help me!
If it helps, this probably would have happened even if Mom was here.
- Someone, please!
- It does help.
- I have to go to - the bathroom.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Ah, shoot.
- I was going to go - outside this weekend.
Maybe the weather's better on channel seven.
Hey, Alison.
- Okay, here's - your book report.
It's a guaranteed "A".
Thank you.
Oh, I totally forgot to do mine.
And I can't afford to get another "F".
No problem.
Now we'll both get "C's".
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now - You're not - the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
-  Malcolm!
Briefcase!
Dewey!
Work pants!
Ready.
Reese!
Vest!
Mom's baby doctor won't let her come home for a few weeks, and since she's not working, Dad had to get a second job.
It's really crazy.
But mostly, it's just funny.
- I have hired a new baby-sitter - for you boys.
She should be here any minute.
- What?
!
What do we need - a baby-sitter for?
Because I want to house to be where I left it.
-  - There she is.
Jessica?
Hi.
Hi, Reese.
Hi, Malcolm.
You know each other?
She's in my class, Dad.
- She's a year - younger than me.
I'll be darned.
No way is she baby-sitting.
She's younger than me.
She's older than me.
Shut up, Dewey.
- Look, kids, - I'm sorry for the mix-up, - But today is my first day, - and I can't be late.
- So we're just going - to have to pull together - And make - the best of it.
- It's going to be - a little embarrassing, I'll grant you that, - but ten years from now - you'll look back and laugh.
In college, I had a poli-sci teacher who was -  - worst dresser in the world.
Why, he was always taking so much time to get ready  Wow, this is weird.
So, you go set the table, and you two wash up for dinner.
-  - Okay.
Excuse me.
This is so exciting.
Oh, look, a light.
And-and what are these marvelous things?
- C clamps.
- The C clamp!
Oh, Otto, it's like a dream.
Oh, Francis, what a brilliant idea, opening our doors to the film industry.
It was no big deal.
- When Patrick said he wanted - to direct a movie here, All I said was, "Sure".
- It's not like it's - a big budget movie or anything.
Don't belittle yourself, Francis.
- They will tell their - friends at the Brown Derby.
Soon, bigger movies will come.
And one day I will be fluffing the pillow of Mr. Rutger Hauer.
-  -  Excuse me.
- Are you an actress?
- Guilty.
- I knew it.
I've seen - you in something.
- I know I have.
- What was it?
Dirty Girls Down Under.
Yes!
No.
That's the one I always get.
I won a Bootie Award for the Best Girl-On-Girl scene.
This is it?
No!
Oh, Otto!
No.
No, no, no, no.
All right, listen up.
- I want you guys - to meet Hal.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Hi, guys.
These are the idiots.
They're totally useless.
- I'm serious.
- Whatever they do, You do the opposite.
- I don't know - what that was about, - But I'm looking forward - to working with you guys.
I'm sure you can teach me a lot.
Can you help me?
Oh, sure, ma'am.
Is this a clock radio or just a radio?
Oh, uh, uh, it's a clock radio.
It's also a CD player.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Did you see that?
- Did either of you - idiots see that?
- This guy's been on the job - two minutes, already he's done More than the two of you jackasses put together.
I-I just read the sign.
Either of you chowder heads ever bother to read a sign?
No, unlike you shiftless losers, - this is a man - who's going to get me - Out of the hellhole of - assistant night manager!
Thank you.
So you guys have a softball team?
I don't understand what relative density is.
- It's the weight of an object - compared to the weight Of an equal volume of water.
Oh, neat.
Reese, you have the next bath after Dewey.
- Two more - minutes, Dewey.
-  - Okay.
You can't make me take a bath.
I'll go outside and roll in the mud, - and I'll go to - bed that way.
Come on, be a big boy.
I'll take the tugboat, and you can have the ducky.
You think this is funny?
It's kind of funny.
- Reese, I'll make - you a deal.
- Help me with the dishes, and - I won't make you take a bath.
You can't make me do anything!
Boy, Alison was right about your temper.
What are you talking about?
- Oh, she was kind of - saying that you were You know what?
Never mind.
Is she mad at me?
I wouldn't say mad.
What'd she say?
I probably shouldn't.
- No, no, no, - you have to.
Give me that.
- Well, it wasn't really - what she said.
- It was more - the way she said it.
Oh, that's baked on.
You'll need some cleanser for that.
Oh, okay.
Go on.
Okay, Reese is easy, but she's good.
- Otto - Ooh, Francis.
- There's a problem - with this film.
- We heard about the actors - that didn't show up, But don't worry.
They gave the part to Gretchen.
What?
!
No!
It's not a big part.
I just walk in und say, "Looks like we're going to need more towels".
Und then I walk out.
- Do you have any idea - what kind of a movie this is?
So it's an independent film.
If the Sundance Film Festival has taught us anything, it is that the low budget film can compete with the big boys.
- But this - It doesn't matter What kind of movie it is.
It makes me feel so-so good, you know?
I guess, like any little girl, I had dreams, ja, - but they said I - wasn't pretty enough, - And they said I - wasn't smart enough.
Your mother was a jealous cow.
Thank you, Francis.
I owe it all to you.
Dad doesn't have time to find us a new baby-sitter, so we're stuck with Jessica, which is fine with me.
I don't plan on spending any time here anyway.
- Dewey, what are - you eating?
Carrot sticks.
Jessica says we have to eat healthier.
I don't what company makes this stuff, but I hate it.
- Reese?
- Don't step on the floor.
- Jessica said - if I scrubbed the floor, - She'd tell me how far Alison's - willing to go with me.
-  - Oh, hi, Malcolm.
- Listen, I need you to make - a salad and set the table.
Oh, that's interesting.
I need you to do it yourself because I'm going to a movie.
On a school night?
You really think Hal would want you to?
Well, he's not here, - so if I want to go to a movie, - I'll go to a movie.
- You know, Malcolm, - I think Hal looks to you - Stop calling - him Hal.
Look, don't think you can control me the way you can these two.
What are you talking about?
- I'm not saying - you don't have some skills.
They're just wasted on me.
I'm smarter than you.
Smarter how?
- My brain just works - differently, okay?
I can see what you're doing and what you're planning at the same time.
So what, you have, like, two brains?
Of course not!
Nobody has two brains.
- Look, do you know how - multitasking works On a computer?
- Here, I'll draw - you a diagram.
Let's say this circle is your conscious mind during a normal conversation.
This intersecting circle represents another track.
- Not opposed - to the first - Wait, wait, wait.
- Slow down.
For lack of a better term, we'll call this track subtext.
Now, with my brain, - there can be four tracks - going at one time, - Plus one supervisor track - that keeps them all in line, - Unless you're - talking about Hey, guys.
- So, when you're not at work, - what do you do for fun?
Nothing.
Yeah, me, too.
Word.
I hold in my hand two tickets to Ozzfest.
They go to our tops salesman of the month.
Hal!
- What?
- Oh, man.
You guys are pathetic.
He beat you in one day.
I just got lucky.
- Hey, you know what?
- I really can't use these.
- If you guys - want to go - Oh, no, - I gave those - tickets to you.
- They're - nontransferable.
We can't reward these idiots for standing around doing nothing!
Randy, let me Randy, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, - but sometimes - a little  Are-are-are they doing that at me?
You know what that sound is?
That's the sound of success.
- And sometimes - my thoughts are, Like, three-dimensional.
- I can almost reach out - and touch them.
- Or they could just be - pure logic, like Malcolm, it's getting late.
Is it?
Oh, man, the movie was over an hour ago.
Huh.
Well, anyway, I'm glad to know how much smarter you are than me.
- Okay, Jessica has taken over - the house, And we need to get it back.
- She can't get - away with this.
Once she finishes laying out our clothes for tomorrow, she's dead meat.
No more early bedtimes, and no more being a Clean Plate Ranger.
Then we're agreed it ends now.
You know, I really am tired.
Me, too.
8:00 is pretty late.
- And I'm really much better - at making someone dead meat - After I've had - a good night's sleep.
But tomorrow She's going down.
No question.
: Did everyone brush our teeth?
Excuse me, Patrick?
- Can I talk to you - about Gretchen?
I love Gretchen.
She's just like my mom, - except she's not - a 60-year-old stripper.
- Look, I didn't know - when I booked your company That you made porn.
My problem is Gretchen really has her heart set on doing this, and - I don't want to call - the police.
Oh, I get it.
So, what's your pleasure Debbie or Lance?
No!
No, that's not what I'm talking about.
- I just have - a little rewrite.
Rewrite?
Let me explain something to you These people are not actors.
You can't just change the words on them at the last second.
- Just look it over.
- It's only a little different.
- Uh, Sicilian volcano, - four letters.
Etna.
A-T E-T-N-A.
We haven't managed to get rid of Jessica yet, but we've been putting the screws to her pretty good.
It's just a question of time.
Your tea.
Thank you, Malcolm.
Isn't he sweet?
All right, boys, bedtime!
No way!
No, I want to stay up and do more sew Oh, my God!
Boys.
They're overtired.
- : - Excuse me.
All right.
Get your butts in your bed right now, - or I'll tell - everyone you know That you walk around in your mother's shoes.
But that's a secret!
And I'll tell Alison - you spent an hour - on the phone with Cindy Reid.
Oh, now it's a crime to be a good listener?
And a certain boy genius takes Pro-Gro Bodybuilding Supplement.
I do not.
"Bulk up now, watch the ladies say wow".
No one will believe you.
- Maybe not.
We'll just leave it - to the tough, But always fair, court of high school public opinion.
For the love of God, it's 7:30.
We're supposed to be tougher than her.
- Well, Malcolm's supposed - to be smarter than her.
- I am smarter - than her.
She just caught me off guard a couple of times.
- I'll come up - with something.
Something heinous, something brutal.
- Dewey, get your - footy pajamas.
I'm not wearing those.
- Do you want to spend - the rest of your life Trying to remember what chocolate tastes like?
And take Professor Cuddles.
Dewey, what are you doing up?
I'm trying to be a big boy, but I miss my mommy.
- : - Aww Come here, honey.
: Okay, he's asleep.
Whose turn was it?
Yours.
Truth or dare?
Truth.
What is your deepest, darkest secret?
Well  Attention shoppers: the store is now closed.
Please bring your purchases I mean, don't I seem likable to you?

Throughout our conversation here, I haven't used - any unnecessary - compliments, have I?
I just want a toaster.

I found it in the dishwasher.
that's $62.79.
What?

- What is it going to take - for you boys To learn some responsibility?
You can't just go through life letting things slide?
Sooner or later, you are going to learn that Is it the tenth already?
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now - You're not - the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
- Mom's been at her sister's - for a month, Resting while she's pregnant.
- Things were kind of chaotic - for a while, But we've settled into a pretty nice rhythm.
Can I use a glass?
No.
Nothing that requires washing.
- Okay, - let's clear the table.
- Oh, I talked to your mother - last night.
She misses you all very much, and she'll be home soon.
How soon?
A few weeks.
- Oh, and Reese, - she wanted you - To sweep the leaves - off the garage roof - When you get home - from school today.
- What?
But today - is the one day - That Alison's parents - aren't home.
To interfere with our homework.
- Reese, your mother - This isn't fair!
- Mom can't control us - when she's not even here!
Nobody is being controlled by your mother.
For instance, I'm inviting an old friend over tonight, - and even though - we're never going to tell Your mother about it, it doesn't mean we're being controlled.
- To repeat: Your mother is never - to hear about this.
And you boys are just going to love Larry.
- We were inseparable - in high school.
But seriously, your mother cannot find out he was in this house.
Dad, you're hurting me.
Oh.
Sorry, sweetheart.
-  - Malcolm Stevie!
Hi, Mrs. Hooper.
- Do either of you - hooligans - Know where my son, - Dabney, is?
- I don't know.
- He was excused from gym.
- What is a nervous eyelid - anyway?
It's an allergic reaction to either gluten, whey or air.
- I suppose - you boys are coming - To Dabney's birthday - party tonight.
- Yeah.
- Sure.
- Just a little reminder: I don't want either of you showing up with any punk hairdos or racy outfits.
What are you doing on the pavement, huh?
- I told you to walk - on the grass.
There's another guy - who doesn't let me walk - on the grass.
- Fine, you like the pavement - so much, kiss it.
Oh, my God Dabney!
You come away from there!
Did you make - eye contact - with that big boy?
- When you're - in danger, You tuck and cower.
- I was cowering; - he wouldn't let me tuck.
I'm a little teapot, short and Ow!
Here is my handle Here is my Ow!
When I get all steamed up - Hear me - Ow!
Tip me over and - Pour me - Ow!
Not it.
Hello?

So Piama called she and Gretchen got to Tucson okay.
Tucson the city that never sleeps.
They think they're going to have so much fun but we will show them, eh?
Just us guys.
- Where do you want - your things, Otto?
Just put them in Francis' room.
What?
Oh, and Gretchen left this for you.
Wh?
Hold on.
Why is he bringing your things to my room?
- Because I'm staying with you - this weekend.
I have not slept alone in a bed for 35 years.
You're planning on sleeping in my bed?
With me?
It would be presumptuous of me to ask a guest.
- "Don't forget to sweep - the leaves - "off my roof - 'cause I'm a mean old lady.
- "Who cares if it's wet - and slippery?
- "The roof - has to be cleaned 'cause I'm stupid".
-  - Not it.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Mom.
I wasn't talking about her.
What do you mean "Mom"?
- It's me, Francis.
- Did you page me?
Yeah, Reese is right here.
I'll tell him, Mom, but does he really have to stay up all night?
Can't he fix my bike tomorrow?
Well, you're right.
Saturday morning is the best time for riding.
-  - Okay.
Now I get it.
Just go easy on him.
You're a lot smarter than he is.
I've got to go.
Whoo!
Whoo!
This floor is so cold.
- Get me under those - warm blankets.
Aah!
Aah.
Aah This is sort of weird.
I haven't had a sleep-over since I was in the third grade.
I was at Jeffery Feldman's house and his mom, uh Otto, what the hell are you doing?
!
I know, I am a notorious blanket hog.
- Mmm.
-  - Otto!

Push!
Look!
I'm starting to crown!
Get this horrible thing out of me!
Can he open presents now?
Yeah, can I?
Oh, okay, but go slow.
We don't want to end up covered in paper cuts, do we?
- Boy, this is such - a great party.
It's twice the turnout we had last year.
Can I open Grandpa's present first, Mom?
Well, we might as well get that out of the way.
Whoa.
The XJ 7000!
Cool!
What is it?
It's a paintball gun.
- It's, like, the best - one you can buy.
I'll take that.
But, Mom!
When will your thoughtless grandfather learn?
These gifts do nothing but overstimulate you.
- And when the - so-called fun ends, You're left all red and giggly and up until 9:00.
Well, not this time.
Give it to Mommy.
That's okay.
I wouldn't know how to paint with it anyway.
Why don't you open one of my gifts?
A new hairbrush.
Thanks, Mom.
Want to give it a try?
Sure.
Count down from a hundred.
You boys can help.
One hundred  Oh, ha, ha!
Here he is!
Hey, you big jackass!
It was just Mrs. Haggerty turning around in our driveway.
- So how come Mom won't let you - hang out with this Larry guy?
- Oh, she thinks - he's a bad influence.
You know Mom, she's always - blowing things - out of proportion.
Just like at our wedding.
- Okay, he missed - the ceremony, But he did show up with these two totally hot Well, that's a bad example.
Oh, there was this time in New Orleans when we No, that's no good either.
Oh!
Here's on.
Our families went to the same church - Oh well, you - know your mother.
- She just makes - stuff up.
-  He's here!
Dewey!

Oh, really?
Oh, yeah.
- Well, - that's-that's great, man.
That's-that's just great.
- You know, there's a little bar - down the way that - No, no, she's out - of town for a while.
- Sweet!
- First beer, 7:04.
One of you kids ought to write that down.
Isn't he great?
FRANCIS : This is kind of a landmark night for me.
My first psychological trauma not caused by my mother.
But I guess I do owe Otto for everything he's done for me.
I mean, he and Gretchen have just been amazing.
Gretchen.
I wonder what was in that note?
Whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa They had to take that tractor apart piece by piece - to get it out of - the teacher's lounge.
But you never gave me up, man.
What happened?
I mean, look at me.
Middle-aged, lousy job.
- Dumpy little house - that can't hold the kids I have And another one on the way.
Don't get down on yourself, man.
- The only reason - you're a failure Is because society hates free spirits like you and me.
It's the price we pay - for being in - the vanguard.
- You remember - the way Dawkins Screwed us over?
- Who?
- Dawkins.
- Our boss back - at Carmello's.
You remember senior year, Labor Day weekend?
The kitchen flooded.
- We spent the whole - weekend cleaning it up, - And then he stiffed - us out of 200 bucks.
Wait!
Yeah!
- : - Unbelievable.
- 200 bucks.
I mean, - you take that, - Plus the interest - over all these years, We're rolling in it.
- Boy, if I had that money - right now, - I could afford to build - a nursery.
Thanks a lot, Dawkins.
You want a nursery, Hal?
We could do it.
- Yeah, - I got a contractor's license.
- We could add on to your bedroom - here no problem at all.
- What?
- You knock out this wall, You extend out a little bit.
- We could do the whole thing - for cost.
We'll make do.
- You're not being fair - to the baby, Hal.
I know, but Come on.
Eye of the tiger!
We create our own futures.
Well, you know, you-you you do what you can.
I mean, we'll be okay as long as we  Oh, my God!
Now you're committed.
Let's get to work.
Larry, I don't believe you!
- I invited you over - for a couple of beers, And you punch a hole in my wall?
This is exactly why I haven't seen you in all these!
That little bat did all that?
This is great.
Wait till Lois sees this.
- Dad?
I don't know - what he did last night, But there's no hot water, - and the toilet's full - of sawdust.
- Dewey, if Dad wakes up - by dinner, - Tell him I'm at Dabney's.
-  Okay.
- WOMAN : - Good afternoon.
- The current time is Yeah, Mom.
My bed's going in the sunny spot.
Reese's bed is going in the closet like you wanted.
This is ridiculous.
We're never going to make that movie.
- I'm moving as fast - as I can, okay?
- He's doing a really - good job, Mom.
- You may want to give him - a break.
- Thanks, Dewey.
- You're a good brother.
She said no.
Don't you think it's - a little strange that - your mom keeps calling Just so you can do Dewey's homework and-and fix Dewey's bike, and move Dewey's furniture around?
What are you trying to say?
It's obvious, isn't it?
- She wants you to do - stuff for Dewey.
- Hey, if you want to talk - to her about it As a matter of fact, I do.
Hello?
Yes, good afternoon to you, too.
Well, thank you, but I really don't need to know what time it is.
Wait, listen to me.
Listen to me!
- Forget it, - there's no talking to her.
Good-bye.
Okay, good afternoon.
God, she's polite and rude at the same time.
Ow!
Careful!
Hold still, Mom.
This is a tough area for us.
- Dabney, you get that.
I'm going - to go hop in the shower.
- If that's the Thompsons, - tell them to move their car, - Then they'll get - their cat back.
- Hi, Malcolm.
- Where's your mom?
- In the shower.
- Good.
Then I won't have To put the laxative in her tea.
- We have to meet Stevie - at paintball in an hour.
- Malcolm, I can't - go Mom and I - Are going to put on our - pajamas and watch videos.
Dabney, your grandfather got you this amazing gun, and you have to use it.
Look, Malcolm, I know you think I'm a mama's boy No.
Mama's boys are laughing at you with their mothers.
- Come on, I saw - the look in your eye When you opened it.
Admit it.
You're dying to do this.
- You just have to break free - from your mom.
Malcolm, you don't understand.
In exactly 17 minutes, she's going to open that shower door and expect to see me there with a warm, cozy towel.
All right, let's go.
Oh, my God!
Damn it, Larry!
Okay, think, think.
How can I blame this on the boys?
Good morning, princess.
Larry!
What have we done?
I've actually made my crappy house even crappier.
Yeah, we got a hell of a lot of work to do.
You're damn right we do!
- First things first - We're going to pay - A little visit on our - old friend Dawkins.
What?
Did a little research last night.
Turns out he lives in a place called Carlson Estates.
- Estates, man!
- Can you believe that?
- He's living a - life of luxury.
- You you don't - even have a wall.
- We're going to - get this guy.
Larry, we-we have to fix this.
This?
- This is nothing.
- Two days, tops.
- You lay your - foundation here, zam!
- Little electrical, - zing, zing!
Put in a bay window, vrunt!
You're done.
Now, let's go get Dawkins.
Okay.
- Someone was out of bed - bright and early this morning.
Yeah, Gretchen left me a note.
Can't seem to find it anywhere.
I think it may have been - about your violent - night terrors.
What are you talking about?
I don't speak terrified German, but you must have been having some pretty horrific dreams.
That's ridiculous.
I never dream.
What?
I never dream I go to sleep; eight hours later, I wake up with a slight sore throat just like everybody else.
You screamed for hours.
I think it was you that had the bad dream, but don't worry, I know just what to do.
I will give you a nice, oily massage before bedtime, you will sleep like a baby.
-  - This is going to be sweet.
Now, once we jump the inner fence, I'll take care of the dogs, you take out the cameras.
He lives in a trailer park.
- Yeah, an awesome - trailer park.
- I mean, look at - that double-wide.
- You don't got a - trailer like that.
All right, commando mode.
- All right, you scale - the side of the trailer.
- See if you can get in up there - where the paint's peeling.
- Okay.
- All right, move.
- What's going - on out there?
Larry?
Hal?
Mr. Dawkins?
Is that you?
- : - What a pleasant surprise.
Come on in.
I just put some tea on.
Stevie, cover me!
I'm so glad I dragged Dabney here.
This is exactly the kind of thing he needs.
-  -  Aren't I dead by now?
- In the game, you are.
-   Dabney, just fire back!
Don't fire back.
And don't move.
We're going to go get more ammo.
Get up!
You have to shoot.
You have to do this.
Mom was right.
I could be home watching Dark Victory right now.
You have to fight back!
Just pull the trigger!
But there could be adverse consequences.
That is your mother talking!
Just shoot it!
If you want to be any kind of man, shoot it now.
: Haul ass!
Brush your own damn hair!
Get your own damn towel!
Aaah!
I call Dabney's team.
The tea is great.
I wish I had more to offer you, but the Meals on Wheels van only comes around twice a week now.
No, this is fine.
You've been so nice.
Can I ask you something?
- See, Larry and I - were talking - About old times - at the restaurant, - And a certain - Labor Day weekend came up.
Oh, you mean the time you boys flooded the kitchen.
Huh?
You two were doing chin-ups on the water pipe.
Oh yeah!
We busted it!
- Larry, I think - he's right.
- Mr. Slocumb - didn't want me To give you your paychecks, but I snuck them to your dads.
I almost got fired for that, but what's right is right.
Well, that was illuminating.
We now know the face of all evil is a feeble old man in a trailer park who whittles bird feeders.
Well, I hope we've both learned something here.
Oh, yeah.
What the hell is wrong with you?
!
Eye of the tiger, Hal.
Larry?
Hal?
Are you boys all right?
- Yeah, Mom, he just - finished digging - That underground fort - you wanted.
- I think you're - going to have A lot of fun in it.
Give me that.
- Honey, don't say anything.
- Just listen.
- You were right.
- You're always right.
From now on, I will do whatever you say, - because I have been happier - just mindlessly obeying you Than doing what I think I want - with any - of my so-called friends.
I love you.
I miss you.
Here's Dewey.
Really, Mom?
You want me to cut Reese's hair?
But he loves his hair.
Okay.
This is so unfair.
Just get it over with.
- Mohawks are kind - of out, Mom.
What if I  Do you hear a strange ringing, Mom?
You are so dead!
And the last thing I remember is him shoving paint balls up my nose.
Good.
Then let's just say that's where he stopped.
Where's my boy?
!
What have you done with my poor, delicate boy?
!
Oh, my God!
This is your fault, you evil little Svengali!
I knew I shouldn't let Dabney have any friends!
- Now, Dabney, where - Get the car.
We're going home.
Dabney, you've never spoken to me like this before.
Well, get used to it.
I'm not your little boy anymore, Mom.
I'm your little man.
Oh, my.
Oh Oh, Dabney.
Oh!
"Dear Francis, to stop Otto's night terrors, "just caress his Ohrlappchen.
Gretchen".
-  - His Ohrlappchen?
Please, please, please, please, please.
: Ah  Thank you.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Malcolm, Malcolm, in school, we learned the coolest thing.
- There were these people - who did this broadcast And convinced everyone that aliens were landing.
So, what we do - is we wait for Reese - to fall asleep, Then we flash some lights outside his window, and we go to the TV, but we'll have made a tape Dewey, you're totally overthinking this.
Reese, aliens landed down the street!
Every man for himself!
Oh.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now - You're not - the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
- Mom is coming home a week early - from Aunt Susan's.
- We did all right with her gone, - but we still have A couple things to take care of before she gets back.
Move it, move it.
Now, remember, boys, if you see the bobcat, don't be a hero.
- Stand on a chair - and use your whistle.
Get out of here, Foamy!
Go home!
- You think she'll notice - the grass fire?
- Just remember, - as far as we know, Dewey has always been missing the tip of his finger.
-  - Boys, we're home.
Oh, boys, I've missed you so!
Dad knocked down your bedroom wall.
What?
Honey, I-I know it doesn't look like much, but this is just the beginning stages of a major expansion.
- I have - conceptual drawings here.
Look, look.
- See how it continues - onto my hand?
It was going to be something really nice for you and the baby - with a window seat, - and please just promise - You won't get mad - and leave again!
Hal, I'm just so glad to be home!
Oh!
Ugh!
My sister is the most obnoxious, sanctimonious know-it-all I've ever met.
She spent every minute of my visit telling me everything I've ever done wrong in my life.
It was just awful.
Tell me about it.
Dating her was the worst five years of my life.
Well, you know why she's like that, don't you?
My parents.
- Susan was always - the pretty one, Susan was the smart one, Susan was the one with all the talent.
I was the one that couldn't do anything right.
Hal, it got me thinking about Reese.
- As if you weren't feeling - bad enough.
No, Hal, I don't think that we give Reese enough credit.
I think that if we gave Reese a little more responsibility, - he would rise - to the challenge.
- Now, I'm not talking - about giving him - A key to the house, - or anything.
I just think some encouragement would do him good.
Okay.
Ooh.
Honey, come here.
The eggs have hatched.
Morning.
Dewey, Mom's home.
Huh?
Oh.
Right.
So, it's going to cost at least $800 to close up the wall.
I suppose I can go back to work at the drugstore.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I'm sure I can stand - on my feet - for eight hours a day.
- And if you fall, - the amniotic fluid Provides a great cushion.
We'll think of something.
-  Hey, there's - tons of stuff - We don't use - in the garage.
- Why don't we just put it out - on the front lawn And see if we can sell it?
- You mean like - a garage sale?
That's a terrific idea, Reese.
- Don't you think - that's a great idea, Hal?
- Actually, - I was the one And you know what?
- You can be - in charge.
- You can organize the stuff, - you can set the prices, You can pick the date.
- Why?
I didn't - do anything.
Reese, this isn't a punishment.
This is us demonstrating our faith in you, because I know you are going to do a great job.
We believe in you.
Don't we, Hal?
For God's sakes, he's my son.
I mean, I love him.
Just answer the question, Hal.
Who wants juice?
I do!
-  You can't just sell - all my old stuff.
Everything in that garage represents a precious childhood memory.
- It's a bunch of old magazines, - a broken yo-yo And a Rubik's cube painted all one color.
- Well, you try and solve - that thing!
I'm not going to argue with you.
- You have ten seconds - to come up with a good reason To keep all that junk, or I'm getting rid of it.
- See, this is why - you are a terrible mother.
Because everything has to be a competition with you!
Oh, it does not.
- I'm hanging up!
- I'm hanging up first.
- No, I'm hanging - Damn it!
You mustn't talk about your family like that, Francis.
There is nothing more important than It's a letter from our son, Rutger!
- We must hide - this immediately.
Why do you have to hide a letter from your son?
Otto, no!
What are you doing?
Nothing, because this did not happen.
Nothing happened.
Except for me telling you that nothing happened.
That happened, but only that.
Things will begin to happen again, starting now!
Oh, look, the mail came.
Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Soon as the swelling in my ankles goes down, I'm going to get right back to work with you boys.
Thank you, honey.
No matter what it does to the baby.
- Reese, if you put - the heavy boxes down first, - And then stack - the light ones on top It just kills you I'm in charge, doesn't it?
Oh, wow!
What's that?
This is the transmitter from the pirate radio station I had in college!
- It was only a couple of watts, - but I brought the truth To everyone within three blocks of the west side of campus.
Until the FCC shut me down for telling it like it was.
And for not having a license.
See, the way it works I was just trying to be polite.
I didn't think you were going to punish me for it.
Hey, there, Sparky.
So, half the campus is - goose-stepping down - to the bonfire To be brainwashed by the Stepford cheerleaders The pied pipers of pep.
They want us to forget why we came to this institution, but not Kid Charlemagne.
I am here to seek knowledge.
Let's get going, Hal.
And don't forget your head.
Righty-o.
I remember this toy.
I begged for it for months.
- It was supposed to move and talk - and learn my name.
But the stupid thing never worked.
Robot, robot, robot, robot, robot, robot Okay, now I need a five-inch girder.
Coming right up.
Hey, look, my baseball glove.
Hey, look, my baseball glove.
Dad, is this yours?
- No, it must have - been my roommate's.
You know, I think it might be something - Throw it out.
- It's garbage.
- Reese, maybe we should - try to find out what it is.
Mom!
Malcolm's not respecting my leadership!
Malcolm, you respect Reese's leadership!
Jeremiah was a bullfrog Ooh, come on.
Come on.
Yes!
He said he'd return.
He couldn't be silenced.
Kid Charlemagne is back on the air.
-  - Otto always planned - That when Rutger - finished college, He would come out here und live with us on the ranch.
But instead, he insisted on going to medical school.
And when he was named chief surgeon of his hospital, Otto was crushed.
It's so strange he never mentioned any of this.
That is Otto's Teutonic pride.
He will never, ever show his feelings to anyone.
- OTTO : - Welcome to the Grotto.
I'm sure you will enjoy your stay.
And don't forget to visit the gift shop.
Oh perhaps tomorrow, you would like to go horseback riding on Uncle Otto's pony!
-  - Malcolm, dinner!
Hal, I'm not going to call you again!
There are so many things the government doesn't want you to know, and that's why they don't want Kid Charlemagne on this mic.
Do I love my country?
Yes.
Do I vote?
I used to, until they moved our polling place to the house with the big dog.
Hal!
I said dinner!
- Kid Charlemagne is - back on the air.
I think we should start the garage sale around 7:00, because serious shoppers like to get an early start.
- Unless you have - a different idea, Which I'm sure would be great.
I was thinking 11:30.
So I could watch cartoons.
Oh, so you'll be well rested and better able to focus.
Good thinking.
- Where were you - this afternoon?
I instructed you to separate the twist ties according to length.
- He's been like - this all day.
I was doing homework.
No homework takes more than 20 minutes.
- Hal, what are you - doing out there?
I've been gone for six weeks, - and now that I'm home, - I barely see you.
I missed you, too.
- Why don't I put - on some music?
What is this childish need you have to defy my authority?
- Bite me.
- Just when I was starting - To feel confident - in my abilities.
Malcolm, I am sick of you always putting your brother down.
- This is Reese's project, and you - are going to be supportive.
-  And if the government - doesn't have a car - That runs on water, - then what are they Building all those dams for?
- Reese is in charge - of this garage sale, - And you are going - to obey him.
- No matter - what he asks you to do, You are going to do it.
- But he's - Malcolm, you can either let him - Be in charge of you - for the garage sale, Or you can let him be in charge of you every day for the rest of your life.
-  In case - you haven't noticed, "Evian" spelled backwards is "naive"!
Wow, it's like that guy is saying what we're all thinking.
Hal, will you turn that racket off?
Well, I guess I can't expect a suburban housewife to understand.
Dewey, what are you doing?
A tennis ball doesn't go with the football.
- It goes - with the ceramic bananas.
This is stupid.
- Why are we sorting everything - by color?
Because I say so.
And because alphabetical order was slowing us down.
Us?
This better be good.
There'll be hell to pay - if Jellybean wakes up - from her massage And doesn't see me on the table next to her.
- : - Oh, my God!
Is that a Nortair?
It's a Nortair 680b.
- It's, like, the first - personal computer ever made.
- You have an interest in this - type of stuff, don't you?
- There aren't many - of these left.
I'll give you five bucks for it.
Yeah, right.
I checked online.
- This is in - mint condition.
- It's worth at - least $1,300.
Deal.
No take-backs, - double black magic, - tap it, bomb it, Flush it down the toilet.
You understand it's going to take me a couple days to get the money.
That's exactly what I want.
I want you to buy it - this Saturday - at our garage sale.
- In front of everybody.
- With cash.
You're going to react in horror - when I tell you Reese was going - to throw this in the trash.
- And then - you're going To tell everyone they should have listened to me all along.
You know, right now - you're sounding a lot - like a James Bond villain.
Me?
There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm fine.
And right.
And right!
And on Saturday, everyone's going to know it.
Okay, but these revenge plans have a way of backfiring.
Word to the wise, if you ever make someone an Ex-Lax milkshake, don't do it on an empty stomach.
- HAL : - Someone is looking down at you - From a satellite with his finger - on the death beam, - And somewhere, - someone is watching him.
But who's watching that    Oh, no!
Oh, no.
Sir, do you know why I pulled you over?
Certainly not for operating an illegal pirate radio station.
- I mean, even if I did - have the equipment in college, I wouldn't have kept it and be using it today.
- What's with all these questions, - anyway?
Do you have a warrant?
!
You ran a stop sign a half mile back.
What?
There's no stop sign back there.
It's at the driveway to the country club.
They just put it up.
That stop sign is a declaration of war!
It's for the fat cats - up on top of the hill - playing golf While us regular Joes are late for our second job, or church or dinner with our families.
"Well, I'm sorry - "I missed Little Bobby's - first steps, honey, "but I had to come to a complete stop just because those robber barons can't look both ways"!
Gretchen, what are you doing?
- I was just going - through some - Of Rutger's things - from when he was a boy.
Boy, I don't remember that he was so fat.
Schlupi!
Who's Schlupi?
Otto and Rutger used to love Schlupi.
Otto would put Schlupi on, and Rutger would laugh and laugh.
It was almost like a little brother to him.
Schlupi could say all of the things that Otto couldn't.
Like, "Go to bed".
And "Behave yourself".
And "Take your finger out of there, it's disgusting"!
Oh, the love in that house.
And now it's gone.
- Gretchen, I hate - seeing you so upset.
- You've got to talk - to Otto about this.
- There is no getting through - to him.
He won't even admit that anything is wrong.
OTTO : Oh!
Oh Oh.
Oklahoma Where the wind comes sweeping down the plain And the waving wheat - So you have - the money, right?
- Yes.
It cost me - three Little Lulus - And a Captain - Picard plate.
I hope you're happy.
I'll go get the computer.
You memorize this script.
Reese, that's a great idea you're probably having to help that lady who's trying to buy something.
Yeah, okay.
Can I help you?
How much for the vacuum?
That's a set.
You can only buy that if you buy the lamp.
But I don't need a lamp.
Then you don't need a vacuum.
She'll be back.
And the lamp isn't going without the blender.
You've obviously put a lot of thought into this.
Where the heck does your father keep disappearing to?
And then the stop sign army spring into action, all in support of the military industrial country club complex.
But that's not where it ends.
-  - Ooh.
Okay, pay attention to this.
How many sides to a stop sign?
Eight.
- That's just a little too close - to the number of judges - On the Supreme Court - for this citizen.
Hang on a second, America.
Thank you very much.
That's my piggy bank!
That was in my room!
- Relax, dipwad.
- I got two bucks for it.
It had $16 in it!
Wah-wah.
Spilt milk.
Mom, stupid Reese just did the stupidest thing to my You're as bad as Malcolm.
- I don't want to hear any more - complaining out of you - For the rest of the day, - understood?
Now, go!
Help your brother.
Excuse me, - do you have a microwave - for sale?
No, we Well, actually, yes.
Yes, we do.
Follow me.
- Excuse me, Malcolm, - it's me, Craig.
- What's that - you're holding in your hands?
You mean this thing that I've been trying to save?
That Reese has insisted all along was mere junk?
Mere junk?
Why, your brother couldn't be more wrong, nor you more right.
Please allow me to buy it from you for the princely sum of -  - Come with me.
Dad, what are you doing?
Craig, get back here!
- Mom - What are you doing - With that?
- I ordered you - to throw this away!
- Let go of it, - you idiot!
- Give it!
- No!
There you go $16.
Thank you.
Hey, is that stereo for sale?
Make me an offer.
because we believe in the Constitution!
- We don't think - that the Constitution Is an empty promise.
- We believe in the Bill - of Rights, don't we?
Well, I never understood - what the big deal was - about quartering soldiers.
- I mean, as long as I don't have - to change in front of them.
It's the spirit of free speech!
It's the fundamental - freedom that thousands of men - have given their lives for!
Hang a left here on Riverton.
Attention, you are conducting a broadcast in direct violation of FCC Rule 27.
Pull over.
I'm not going down without a fight!
I'm the voice of the little man!
The man on the girder.
The man on the streets.
The man that fights The Man!
Oh, my God!
You're Kid Charlemagne.
- Give it!
- No!
Let go!
- Reese, don't, - you stupid jackass.
- You don't know - what you're doing!
That is enough out of you!
- Are you really - so insecure that you can't stand - Anyone else getting - any attention?
Your brother has worked so hard - to make this yard sale - a success, He doesn't need you undermining him at ever turn.
- Mom, you have - to listen to me.
We have a Nortair 680b.
It's a type of computer that was built in 1976.
- There's only a few - in existence.
And Craig is going to give us $1,300 for it.
$1,300?
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
!
- I have a lot - of things to sell, - And I don't have time - to argue with this bozo.
I've got a Jet Ski - on hold, and the place closes - at 6:00.
- What are you - talking about?
I'm buying a jet ski with my yard sale money.
- That money - isn't yours.
- It's going to rebuild - our bedroom wall.
- But you said - I was in charge.
- That means - I get the money!
No, it doesn't.
- Then why the hell would I want - to be in charge?
Reese, this is helping you become a better person - by building your - self-esteem, - Which you are obviously - going to need If you are stupid enough to throw away $1,300 that this family desperately needs!
I'm cooperating!
I never met this man before.
I hate the Constitution.
I hate free speech.
I'll snitch.
I know things!
What on earth?
Stop!
Government agent!
Fare warning, sir!
Running adds an additional $80 to your fine!
Otto, come out.
I know you're in here.
This is ridiculous.
It's been three days.
Look, I know you don't want to talk about this, but you can't just keep hiding.
Are you happy like this?
Don't I look happy?
Gretchen is freaking out.
- The guests are leaving - in droves.
And Muffy wants her stall back.
You have to stop this.
There is nothing to stop, because there's nothing wrong.
Now go away.
Look, if there's one thing I'm an expert at, it's pointless family conflict.
- And if Rutger is anything - like me, - You're going to have - to make the first move.
That means you're going to have to deal with your feelings.
I can't.
I know you can't.
That's why I want you to do something for me.
Hmm?
Look at your wedding ring.
Hmm?
Oh.
Schlupi?
Yes, Schlupi.
I think it's about time he weighed in on all this.
I guess I was a little disappointed when Rutger wouldn't come.
And then when the letters came, it was so painful.
I couldn't bear it.
I love him so much, Francis.
And I swore that I would never do that to my son, and now look!
Rutger is such a wonderful boy.
He's so sensitive.
He's-he's so bright I'm going to get Schlupi a phone.
-   - I'll tell you one thing.
have cleared that fence.
And the open manhole.
Oh, God.
How could I have been so wrong about Reese?
Hal, just say it again, please.
- I really need - to hear it.
Okay, okay.
Reese is hopeless.
Thank you.
Ah, sorry.
Hello?
- Mom?
- Francis?
- Listen, I've been doing - some thinking, And I just wanted to tell you - that even though - we haven't always gotten along, - I guess you thought - you were doing What was best for me, and well, I appreciate it.
Wow.
Francis, what brought this on?
I don't know.
I guess I just had a breakthrough.
- Anyway, I wanted to tell you - about this thing That happened in junior high
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
No fair.
He moved.
Too bad.
You've got H-O-R-S.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now - You're not - the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Does this chip look funny to you?
Nope.
It's fine.
- Ha, ha.
You took - the last one.
You have to refill it.
Oh, darn it.
Oh, great.
It's an ant.
I know.
I saw him before.
- No, Dewey, you - don't understand.
This one's the scout.
- If he finds anything - appetizing, Soon there'll be lots and lots of ants.
- Which is why I'm - about to make sure That this scout doesn't report back to headquarters.
-  - Dewey, bedtime!
Ready, Dad?
Bedtime express.
Oh yeah.
Just give me a second here to - Hidey-ho!
- Oh!
And away we go!
- Giddy-up, Dad!
-   - Turn, horsey, turn!
-  I got the nicest dress for the school formal.
It's satiny and long, and-and what's that color between pink and purple?
Mauve.
Oh, sorry.
- Isn't she cute - when she gets excited?
Her cheeks get all red, - and then she gets - a little twinkle in her eye.
- I've got to tell you, - I'm a lucky guy.
- So you're really - going to spring - For a limo and tux - and all that?
- Hell, no.
We're not going - to that dance.
- It would practically wipe out - my leather jacket fund.
- What are you - talking about?
I've got it all worked out.
I let her think we're going, - and then right before the dance, - I pick a giant fight.
- She gets so mad at me, - she doesn't want to go, And then the next day, - I apologize, - she takes me back, And it's smooth sailing until her birthday.
-  - Malcolm!
Where have you been?
- I called an emergency - study session.
What?
We just had an emergency study session last night.
This is the Academic Octathlon.
- We are pitted - against the brightest minds - From every high school - in the country.
- From now on, we will work - through lunch every day.
- I thought this was supposed - to be fun.
Fun is for losers.
- We're all making - sacrifices, Malcolm.
I've had to blow off my cello lessons.
I missed my uncle's funeral.
I've been tanking my grades for the past three months so I could be our team's mandatory "C" student.
- That food is not there - for you to eat, - It is there so I don't get into - trouble for making you work Through lunch.
Now focus!
Why can't I quit?
This is stupid!
- Extracurriculars - are very important.
You think you can coast into college on straight A's?
Well, you can't.
- Besides, this is - a good opportunity To meet other smart kids.
- You're never too young - to start making contacts.
Yeah, make friends for life at a nerdfest.
- It's not nerdy - to spend a weekend Winning a trophy that shows how smart you are!
Well, you're doing it anyway.
Oh, geez, not the cabinets, too.
Honey, where did I put the ant spray?
- Hey, Dad, time - for bedtime express.
Uh, yeah.
Dewey, look, I-I want to talk to you.
- Uh, you're - getting bigger, - And-and there's a - lot of great things About being a big boy, but big boys don't get to do bedtime express, because it hurts Daddy, so even though it's fun, we're not going to do bedtime express anymore.
Okay.
Oh, good.
Then I won't love you anymore.
What?
I won't love you anymore.
- Dewey, you can't just - say something like that Because you're upset.
I'm sorry, but I can't help the way I feel.
Good night, Dad.
- Reese, did you get - your tux yet?
- Uh, the dance is - in two days.
- Of course I - got my tux.
Good.
Hey, look at this.
It's my dress.
Isn't it amazing?
Are you sure this is going to fit because you're so fat.
Oh, you're such a goofball sometimes.
- Anyway, I really - like these bows.
- Maybe I should get - matching shoes, - But I don't want it - to look too outfit-y.
Hey, honey, - you won't believe - the day I had.
- I had a pretty - interesting day, too.
I had to wear these filthy clothes to work - because you forgot to pick up - the dry cleaning again.
For crying out loud, I just got off a 12-hour shift.
- The last thing - I need is for you to You know what?
Let's not do this.
Do what?
Fight.
We argue way too much.
You're right.
Why can't we just both shut up for once and give ourselves time to be in love with each other?
Let's just not talk about it.
I am having the best time with Piama today.
It's like every moment was perfect, - and-and seemed - to blend perfectly Into the next perfect moment.
I have had 25 years of days like that with my Gretchen.
I heard that, schminky pants.
I will save this for later.
See, when marriage works, there is nothing like it.
Now let me ask you something.
You and Gretchen - You never argue - about chores, right?
- Like, if there's an errand - to be run, You do it, she does it, who cares?
I never really thought about it.
I am sick and tired of doing all of these chores!
Ooh!
I work hard all day!
I work like a dog, and you don't appreciate it!
You just spend money on whatever you want!
I spend?
!
You spend money like we have a key to the mint or someplace!

- I have my own pillow, - thank you.
I just need some help blowing it up.

- If any of you are not fully - committed to this team, You are more than welcome to get off the bus right now.
Driver, open the doors.
I did not say stop.
I said open the doors.
That silly fighting.
Let us never do that again.
That is not us.
No.

Oh, me, neither, hmm?
We will never speak of this again, hmm?
Of what?
See, I already forgot it.
Here - Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.
I am sure you two will be very happy here.
We could be happy anywhere.
Aw.
Let me ask you something.
- I do plenty of - chores, okay?

!
I've got to get a stronger spray!
- Dewey, I'm going to - the hardware store.
I'll be back soon.
Love you.
That's nice.
Okay, this is crazy.
You can't not love me just because I won't give you bedtime rides.
Yes, I can.
- Oh, this is not - going to work, mister.
I know you love me.
I like you.
And that's it?
I think you're a nice man.
Fine.
You know what?
- Maybe you need to spend - some time in your room - And think about - this a while, okay?
- As of right now, - you are grounded!
Okay.
And then tomorrow I'm going to buy you a brand-new bicycle.
It's not going to change anything.
Food fight!
What the hell are you doing?
!
- Come on!
It's - a food fight.
No, it's not.
- You're just throwing - egg salad at me.
Yeah, 'cause that's the kind of thing I think is fun.
You are such a jerk!
That's it!
I don't ever want to see you again.
Until the dance!
Here it is, children.
The battlefield.
Get comfortable with it.
Make it your own.
I'm getting a panic rash over my homesick rash.
Suck it up, people.
Tomorrow is the finals.
- Now, do you see that - air conditioning vent?
- Jefferson High has three - asthmatics on their team.
- If we could just get them - to sit directly beneath - Mr. Baffert.
- Oh, you've done it again.
- What a stellar job - at organizing Don't suck up, Lionel.
It's pathetic.
Don't worry, sir.
- We were ready - to grab your ankles If you got too far up there.
Hey, Herkabe.
- Surprised to see you - and your band of bed-wetters Had the guts to show up.
Oh, look, it's North High.
- Nous les nourrirons - leurs propres entrailles Et fait les demande plus.
Oh, my God.
They brought in Rubinger from Minnesota.
- Who?
- IBM's been studying him.
- Rumor has it - he was a Siamese twin That got both brains.
Walk with me.
- You see those little freaks - over there That you call friends now?
They need to win here - so they can get into - one of the top colleges Because that's the only way - they're going to become - successful enough - So that people don't - beat them up every day For the rest of their lives.
- Now, are you going - to deny them that?
I'll try my best.
Good.
Now, the judges will spot Morse code easily, - so I've developed this - rudimentary fingertip semaphore.
Memorize this.
You want me to cheat?
Let's call it success advantaging.
- Forget it.
- I'm not going to cheat.
Guys - Guys, you're not going - to believe this.
- Herkabe actually wants us - to cheat.
What?
That isn't right!
- Yeah, he's not supposed - to write it down.
That's a paper trail.
You guys are in on this?
Malcolm, you have no idea.
This is big.
- This goes further - than you know.
Further than you guys?
Oh.
Then you do know.
Are you in or are you out?
-  - Hey!
Hey!
I'm the one who has to fix that if you break it.
Sorry.
You work here?
My dad's the manager.
- You know, - for a bunch of dweebs, - You guys sure cause - a lot of trouble.
- I can't believe - you put on SPF45.
It's an indoor pool.
- But we have to cross through - the courtyard to get there.
- How can you be around them - for more than ten seconds And not want to deck one?
Trust me, it's not that satisfying.
Plus, some of them are my friends.
Were my friends.
No, still are.
- I'm just not - happy about it.
- What would you do - if your friends - Wanted you to do something - you didn't want to do?
Not do it.
Yeah, but see, that won't work.
- Because even if I don't, - they're going to do it anyway.
- And that makes me a part of it, - whether I do it or not, So there's no way out.
Um, there's probably some kind of obvious smart-guy reason I'm missing here, but can't you just leave?
Reese!
How many times have I told you?
- No ice cream - in the living room.
- You're dripping - all over the rug!
Are you crazy?
!
- No, just extremely - disrespectful.
- I mean, what are - you going to do - With a kid like me?
- Ground me?
You bet I am.
One week in your room.
No TV, no video games, - no contact - with the outside world.
After you take Alison to the dance.
What?
!
Reese, you made a promise - to that girl - and you are going to keep it.
But how did you?
- Look, Reese, - some people are born book-smart.
Others are born crafty and street-smart.
You, I'm afraid, are neither.
Hello?
Mom, come get me.
Look, I have to get out of here.
I'm leaving either way.
- If you're not here - within the next three hours, You can find me walking on the highway, in the dark.
Or maybe I'll hitchhike.
- You know, - I met this guy with a van.
He seemed real friendly.
You should do more chores!
I'm too tired.
You should spend less money!
We never have sex!
Are you too tired for that?
How can we when your parents are always visiting?
- I cannot wait until I am old - and senile.
I'm going to be - hooked up to life support - in your attic Running you ragged with crazy old person demands.
- I am going to cling - to life for years Just to make you suffer.
Fine.
But I'm not staying here.
That son of a Stop the car!
- What?
- Stop!
I'm staying.
I will not be played like that!
- You can punish me - when I get home.
Deal.
- All right, - this has gone far enough.
- Now, I will walk you - to your room, - I will roll you - to your room, - I will race you - to your room, But you are too big to give bedtime rides to.
If you say so.
I say so.
Now, as your father, - I am ordering you to say, - "I love you".
I love you.
Now say it in a convincing manner.
I love you.
- Now say it - without me telling you to.
- Is this going - to take long?
- 'Cause I was going - to get a soda.
Unless I'm too big to drink soda.
Just go.
Oh, for crying out loud.
These things are everywhere!
I don't know, Malcolm.
This seems like a very drastic escalation.
- You want to cheat, - right?
- Since this is just - a big cheating contest, - I say we out-cheat - everyone else.
- Why do I have to be the one - who does this?
- 'Cause you look the most - pathetic in a bathing suit.
I do not!
What about?
Yeah, okay.
Go, Stevie.
Uh, excu-excuse me.
- I got locked out - of my room, And I forgot my towel and I'm very cold.
There you go.
Have a nice day.
Thank you.
I've been swimming!
- Good job.
- I'll be out in a minute.
-  - I do all the chores, - I make all the money - and I'm sorry - If I'm a little tired - when we get into the bedroom!
- That's why we took - this vacation!
- We took this vacation to - get away from your parents.
- You have no clue.
- Because you never tell me - What you're thinking!
- I'm not a mind-reader!
I got the answers.
- I'm going - to go make copies.
You guys stay here - and keep the door open - till I get back.
Everybody look casual.
Now let's see you chicken out.
- What are you doing?
-  - It's not what - it looks like.
- It looks like you're trying - to break your foot - Just so you don't have to go - to the dance with me.
Ha!
You couldn't be more wrong.
If you don't want to go with me, then why don't you just break up with me?
I really like you, Alison.
I just didn't want to spend all that money on the dance.
I know that was selfish, and I'm really sorry.
But I still really want you to be my girlfriend.
Well thanks for being honest.
But you made a promise to me, and I'm going to hold you to it.
You're going to get me a corsage, and you're going to rent a limo, and you're going to pick me up at 7:00, and we're going to go to the dance.
Okay.
You'll see.
We'll have a great time.
We'll dance the spotlight dance, and we'll make sure we get our picture taken together so we'll always remember this night.
- And then I'll break up with you - forever.
Someone I know was a busy little team player last night.
- It just came to me - what the right thing to do was.
I've never been prouder of you than at this moment.
We never spoke.
Ladies and gentlemen.
We are now ready to begin round one.
The subject will be history.
Question one: "In 1803, the French sold over Louisiana Purchase.
Correct.
Question two: "What historic document" The Magna Carta.
Correct.
Question three: "Who" Ben Franklin.
That's right.
Settle down, please.
Let's try this again.
Question -  - The defenestration of Prague!
Okay -  - The Treaty of Utrecht!
Will all coaches join me in the back?
- You gave everyone - the test, didn't you?
In fingertip semaphore, this means I know what it means!
Good night, Dad.
- Dewey, I-I know - it's just an expression, And I'm a mature person, so if you don't want to say it, you don't have to say it.
Thanks for understanding.
Well, I love you!
But guess what?
I don't love you!
And you!
And I don't love you or you or you!
And I especially don't love you!
And you love!
- Don't try to get away!
-   If you just love I-I hate  : Oh, no.
Dad, we need more toothpaste.
Dad?
- Dad, wake up!
- Get out of there!
Dad!
Dad!
Get up!
Get up, please!
Don't die, Dad.
I love you!
I love you, Dad!
Are they dead?
Am I dead?
Well, I-I I passed out.
I How did you pull me all the way over here?
I guess 'cause I'm bigger.
Oh, good.
Thank you, son.
You saved my life.
I love you.
I love you, Dad.
Well, the results are in.
Since everyone was so well prepared, everybody gets a trophy.
- Jefferson, - you win first place in science.
Quincy, you win in mathematics.
North High, history.
St. Bartholomew, literature.
And Marshall in ethics.
As you can see, it's a happy ending for all, so long as everybody keeps their mouths shut.
See you next year.
Hey, no hard feelings, okay?
I mean, I got you, you got everybody.
It was kind of cool.
Right.
Cool.
- I wonder what - would've happened If we'd played it straight.
- You know, gone - head-to-head for real.
You've got to be kidding.
- Compared to you, - he's a whole other species.
You should be his pet.
Come on.
We're sorry we tried to make you cheat.
- You're our moral compass, - Malcolm.
We'd like to make it up to you somehow.
Let's all pick him up - and carry him to the bus - on our shoulders.
- That's a - great idea.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Actually, I should - sit this one out.
- With my middle - ear condition My scoliosis.
I forgot my orthotics.
Sorry.
Epstein Barr.
Yes, Mr. Cutler, we have your reservation right here.
- Hey, what time is it there - in Australia?
Canceling?
Oh, no.
Well, it's a shame to let one argument with your wife spoil Sure, you can ask me whatever you want.
Hi, honey.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
-  - Ow!
Ow!
Finally.
All right, you stupid, useless old man.
There's going to be some big changes around here.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now - You're not - the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Hal.
Wake up.
It's time.
Already?
- The baby's not due - for a month.
- I told you it wasn't conceived - in the elevator.
It was Dewey's parent-teacher conference.
Here, there's something in this one.
Let's go.
- No, Hal, - I'm not having the baby.
We said we'd finish making out our will tonight.
Tonight?
I didn't agree to that.
- Besides, how do you know - you're not having the baby?
You're not a doctor.
Come on.
I'll meet you there.
Hal, I have both sets of car keys.
And I took the seat off your bike.
Why do we have to do this - in the middle - of the night anyway?
I will not have the boys see us writing a will.
- If they start thinking - about a future without us, We'll totally lose control.
- I'm telling you, Lois, - we are not equipped To deal with these issues.
- We get into a giant, - stupid fight - Every time we work - on the will.
- Hal, last time we tried - this was ten years ago.
And it led to a fight.
You called me thin-skinned and overly sensitive.
- Hal, you can stall all night, - but we are going to do this.
- Fine.
- I'll get a pencil.
This pencil's too short.
Hal.
Oh, all right.
Just remember, - we're not doing this - for ourselves.
- We're doing this - for the children.
What if there was a terrible accident and we had no plan?
Our poor boys would be alone and defenseless.
- And I guess - you kids Really didn't do any major harm, - so I've decided - to let you off  Okay, tangible assets.
- How do we expect - to find anything?
- We just shove stuff - in boxes.
- Look, there's - a fortune cookie in here.
- Wait, here's something - we already did.
This'll save time.
We already decided Malcolm gets the coin collection.
- Great.
- What coin collection?
You remember that proof set we had hidden in the closet?
The one that Dewey found and swallowed Oh, yeah, that was 500 bucks down the drain.
And not one dime in the strainer.
- Whatever happened - to the silver tea set?
The boys pounded it into a suit of armor.
Wedding china, antique stemware, hand-blown crystal butterflies.
Why did we even buy those?
Hal, we have fewer assets today than we did ten years ago.
- We can't be - this broke.
We just can't be.
- Where are - the bank statements?
Right here.
Checks and everything, - but you are not going - to find anything helpful.
- By the way, I would - like it noted That I tried to avoid this whole evening - because I knew - this would happen.
Maybe in the future, you'll trust my judgment.
You spent $300 on sequins?
And bad mistakes I've made a few I've had my share of sand kicked in my face But I've come through And we mean to go on and on and on and on We are the champions, my friends And we'll keep on fighting till the end We are the champions, we are the champ That was for the car.
And what about this?
$520 to the hospital for toy extraction?
Live, live, die.
Live, live, live, live, die.
You know, son, - maybe you've - been spending too much Silence.
Seize him.
All right, son, I think it's time you goose-stepped off to bed.
Dad, you're embarrassing me in front of my men.
Hal!
Why is this still here?
: Ow.
Oh, my God.
- Do you realize - how much money we spent - Sending Francis - to military school?
That one we couldn't avoid.
He needed the discipline.
No!
No, no!
Now we are going to do this until you get it right.
All right, now once more.
With feeling.
And Candyman Hey, Candyman Who can take a sunrise - Who can take - a sunrise Sprinkle it with dew Ooh-ooh-ooh Cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two?
Candyman Candyma-an The Candyman can The Candyman can The Candyman can 'cause he mixes it with love And makes the world taste good Oh-oh-oh The Candyman makes everything he bakes Satisfying and delicious Do-do-do-do Talk about your childhood wishes You can even eat the dishes.
- Why would - a bank let us - Keep an account - this messed up?
- There are checks - out of sequence - Look, a check - from next year.
And this is two different checks taped together.
- What difference - does it make, Lois?
You know better than anybody.
We are in the crapper.
- You sound like - you're blaming me.
Oh, you're blaming me?
-  - We both agreed that you would - Be in charge of the finances.
This may be part of the problem.
Okay, let's forget about the finances.
"Property transfer to the surviving spouse".
We can do this.
- I think that whoever goes first, - the other one - Is going to want - to stay - In the house - with the kids until What?
Nothing.
- Why are you looking - at me like that?
No, I'm just, you know just I've always known that you'll die first.
What?
- And then I'll commit suicide - a few days later.
- I don't want to live - without you, Lois.
- What?
!
- Oh, don't act - So surprised.
We both know what I'm talking about.
No, I You're wishing me dead?
Why would you say such a thing?
Oh, and there is no reaction at all to my suicide.
Oh, that's a real eye-opener.
What makes you think that I am going to die first?
Honey, you just have that kind of personality.
You operate at a very high level of stress.
Are you aborigines?
!
I have had it!
Fire?
Fire?
!
Whose damn dog is this?
!
I said whose damn dog is this?
!
This is the property line!
The property line!
The property line!
You can't cross the property line!
Come out here and apologize to me like an adult!
Oh, that's real mature.
I can't believe that you are wishing me dead and insulting my personality.
Calm down, Lois.
I am just pointing out that I am the far more relaxed person.
Get in the car and go.
Shut up!
- I just don't - let the stress get to me.
I haven't had any special training; it's just my way.
- You are going - to pay for this.
- Oh, see, that kind of comment - doesn't help anyone.
I'm sorry, I only just learned that I am a human time bomb.
- And you're not - the least bit curious About how I'm going to do it?
Oh, you are not going to kill yourself.
You can't even rip off your own Band-Aids.
I happen to be very hairy, but this is different.
I have thought this through.
It is going to be beautiful and romantic and it's going to make everyone forget about your stupid funeral.
Shh!
The boys.
Ow!
Shh!
You can't handle that.
- How are you going - to kill yourself?
You startled me!
Ow!
Stop it.
Shh.
Ow!
Shh!
How you like that?
Ow!
Shh!
Ow!
- Shh!
- Ow!
- Ow!
- Shh!
- Ow!
- Shh!
Okay.
I think we both have a lot to apologize for.
I am sorry for pulling your hair.
- I'm not proud - of the Dutch rub Or the ear twisting.
- See?
We're back on - the path to adulthood.
- Let's get to work.
- I agree.
Let's stop and go to bed.
Hal, sit down.
We're past the worst of it.
Okay.
In the event of death of both parents, who do we want to appoint as a guardian?
My family's out.
- Well, they're not going - to my family.
Hello.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Grandma.
Ooh, geez.
- Shouldn't we have - more choices?
- Doesn't it seem - if we die, - There should be - more people willing To give our kids a home?
You want to see a strike?
- Malcolm, what - are you doing?
Look at me.
I'm the world's greatest bowler.
I care so much about bowling.
Bowling is so important.
Malcolm, come back here.
You want a strike, I'll give you a strike.
Here's your damn strike.
Where is he going?
The faster we're falling We're stopping, stalling We're running in circles again Just as things were looking up - You said - it wasn't good enough But still we're trying one more time Maybe we're just trying too hard When really it's closer than it is too far Wow.
Nice.
It was.
'Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep Up above in my head, instead of going under Reese, that was amazing.
Listen, when the kids at school ask you about this tell them I got under your bra.
Give 'em a reason.
The suspect appears to be resisting.
Oh.
It looks like - they're taking out - the pepper spray.
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this In the firelight, Fernando You were humming to yourself And softly strumming your guitar I could hear the distant drums And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar There was something in the air that night The stars were bright, Fernando They were shining there for you and me For liberty, Fernando Though we never thought that we could lose There's no regret If I had to do the same again I would, my friend  Well, there's one bright spot in all of this.
- We finally agree - on something.
- There's no one to - take care of our kids.
You're not going to even mention Francis?
Let's go to bed.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Why won't you even consider it?
Hal, this is hard enough - without you getting - us sidetracked.
This isn't about Francis.
This is about our children.
You know what I mean.
Why is Francis such a bad idea?
He's working, he's married.
He's showing responsibility.
Look, I will be the first to admit that Francis was not the easiest kid for you to deal with, but he has changed.
Oh, yeah.
Big change.
- He quit school, - moved 3,000 miles, And married someone that he knew for exactly 20 minutes.
- You can't make - life decisions On a whim and be a good parent.
A good parent understands that actions have consequences.
Lois, we are parents precisely because we can't remember that.
- You have never been able - to give him credit For anything good he does.
Good he does?
Like what?
Like Look, I am not a performing seal, Lois.
- I can't just bark out - a list of good deeds - While you take a bow - and throw me a mackerel Out of your fanny pack.
- I can't talk to you - when you're hysterical.
- No, no, no.
You can't - get out of this - By playing the - "my husband is crazy" card.
- It didn't work with - the airport security screener, - And it is not going - to work now.
I am stunned that you are even thinking of having him take care of the boys.
He's the worst-behaved of all of them.
I love you so much.
- Why don't you just admit it, - Lois?
You have never liked Francis.
Is it any surprise why he's been such a mess growing up?
You can't blame the way Francis is on me.
You-you honestly don't see your part in all of this?
Parents' weekend at the military school.
You two got into a sword fight.
You dragged him - off the field in the middle - of a tee-ball game Because you thought he gave you a look.
- His first words were, - "You shut up".
Lois, you two have been at each other's throats since the day he was born.
- He started it.
- What?
- Nothing.
- No, no.
- You said he started it.
- What does that mean?
Just leave me alone.
- How the hell can - a baby start anything?
I don't know, Hal.
It's just, everything started so badly right after he was born.
What, the staph infection?
- What does that have - to do with anything?
I was stuck in a hospital without my baby.
Completely isolated.
For six weeks all I could do was lie there and-and worry about him and think about how much he needed me to nurse him and to and to hold him.
- And when - they finally Let me out, I run home as fast as I can to take care of poor little Francis, and when I get there, I discover he's happy.
- He couldn't - have cared less - I was gone - all that time.
- You were taking - care of him.
- He was happy - as a clam.
I was just an intrusion.
Honey, I had no idea I know it's wrong and I know it's creepy and I can't help it.
I'm the worst mother of all time.
It's just as much my fault.
We've just never gotten this right.
We are utter failures as parents.
I mean, look at this pigsty.
Look at how we live.
- Why are we bothering - even making a will?
- All we can leave - our children is misery.
We are a walking advertisement for forced sterilization.
Who are the idiots in Washington that allowed us procreate?
I mean, this family is an unmitigated disaster.
-  - Oh!
Aah!
Oh!
Ow!
Ow!
Oh!
Eat chalk, evildoer!
-  - Ow!
I hit my head!
Ow!
Shh.
- Honey, honey, - calm down.
Let me have a look.
It really hurts.
- It's bleeding, - isn't it?
I know it's bleeding.
Dewey, what's 19 times five?
I'm in What?
- 19 times five.
- Try to figure it out.
- Yeah.
- Well Ten times five is 50, so County or St. John's?
- St. John's.
Pediatric - emergency opened again.
Okay, Dewey, everything's going to be fine.
- Yeah, for Dr. Flannery.
- Please tell him - My son Dewey got - a bad bump on his head.
- My husband will meet him - at St. John's.
They'll be there in ten minutes.
- Okay, sport.
- Field trip.
- Can I have a box - of apple juice?
Oh, all we have is apple-cherry.
- Of course that's - all we have.
We're the worst parents in the world.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you just call my wife "wide ride"?
- I get it.
You got to - make a big show for Now, you are going - to get up and - apologize   All right, fight.
- Get him, Dad!
- Come on.
Come on, work the gut.
Hold this.
All my life was a paper Once plain, pure and white Till you moved with your pen Changing moods now and then till the balance was right And you decorated my life By painting your love All over my heart You decorated my life Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hal, I'm leaving a sandwich here for you.
Thanks, honey.
Wow.
That was quick.
- You must have been - really hungry.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now - You're not - the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
- Come on, boys, breakfast!
- Let's go!
- You're going to be late!
- Hal, look what you're doing.
Oh, for God's sake!
My last good tie.
- No.
I just bought you - a whole 12-pack.
- Well, I went - through it!
Mom!
Oh, for the love of Pete!
Reese blew his nose on my shirt!
- Because Dewey put his dirty - underwear on my pillow!
-  - And one of them used My graphing calculator to smash open a juice box!
Everybody just shut up!
- Your mother is nine months - pregnant.
- She's stressed out enough - as it is!
- She doesn't need - all this screaming!
- All right, - you know what?
I know how to solve this.
- We're only going to be gone - for two days.
- We're going to have - at least one weekend - Before this baby's born where - we get some peace and quiet.
Without us?
You know the plan?
As soon as you leave, I put Reese on a bus to his grandma in Canada.
- After school, I take - Malcolm over to Stevie's.
And Dewey stays with me.
Looks like you're the lucky winner.
Why are you splitting us up?
- Because this - is the only way - The judge would - let us leave town.
- Have fun in school - today, suckers.
I'll send you a postcard from Whitehorse.
Reese, figure it out.
It takes 26 hours to get there and 26 hours back.
Your backpack is full of food, and no one ever called Grandma.
Wait a minute.
I'm spending the entire weekend on this bus?
I'm so glad we're finally here.
I can't believe you made me walk that extra 150 yards.
Trust me, valet parking Even complimentary valet parking is a scam.
Welcome to Lovebirds, a couples resort.
Wow.
Hi.
We have a reservation.
- Could we get to - our room quickly?
- I really have to - use the bathroom.
Again.
I'm sorry, but the room we were holding for you is no longer available.
You gave away our room?
- I'm sorry, sir.
- You were four hours late, And you didn't call.
But it's my wife.
We have to stop every ten miles - because she has - to pee all the time.
- I do not have to - pee all the time.
Don't worry.
I think we can find you something.
- I don't know - if you've read our brochures, But this is sort of a romantic hideaway for couples.
We know what it is.
Let me see what I can do.
- I have to get - off my feet.
Angela Yes, Warren?
Yes?
I am so sorry.
- I just had - to sit down.
- Don't - don't mind me.
You mind if we turn off that fireplace?
- I'm sweating - like a pig.
- Well, little man, - you and I have quite - The fun-filled - weekend ahead of us.
Tomorrow morning, there's jazz at the Farmer's Market.
- Then Lifetime is having - an intimate portrait Of Sandy Bullock.
- And tomorrow night, - there's Improv in the Park With a political bent.
Sound fun?
- I think I just - want to play.
Play?
Well, sure, - we could squeeze in - some play, I guess.
Why don't you go ahead and get that started?
- No, I mean play together.
- What do you mean?
We can play fort.
Ooh, I don't have Fort.
I have Clue, - but it's a collector's edition, - unopened.
- If you want, - I can show you a picture of it.
No.
You don't have to have fort.
You just do it.
- Didn't you ever play fort - with your friends When you were a kid?
Of course I played.
I had friends, plenty of friends.
And you're short.
Come on.
I'll show you.
Hello, ma'am.
This is Mel Jenkins with Transway Bus Lines.
- I don't know how - to tell you this.
I was keeping an eye on your son for you, like you asked, - but when we got out - on the interstate, - He went into the bathroom, - and Well, he must have jumped out the window while we were moving.
- I'd gone 60 miles - before I noticed.
-  - What?
!
How could you do this to my favorite son?
The only one I ever loved is now lying in a ditch somewhere.
Well, I'd better call the coffin store.
Good-bye.
I knew it!
I knew if I came back I'd catch you here.
- You can't be trusted - for five seconds, Let alone a whole weekend.
Okay, look, just don't tell Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?
Me?
I'm here to guard the house from your bad things you're doing.
What's in the bag?
Candles - chocolate-covered - strawberries Sleepless in Seattle.
My God, you're gay.
No, I'm not.
- Look, I don't know - how I did it, But I talked Kathy McCulskey into coming over tonight.
Kathy McCulskey?
I'm impressed.
She doesn't leave her house - for anything less - than second base.
Which is exactly why we need the house to ourselves.
- I'm sorry, Malcolm.
I'm already - committed to this party.
- Reese, you've seen - enough teenage movies To know how badly this is going to turn out.
I haven't just seen them, I've studied them.
And I found the fatal flaw.
In every one of those movies, - the party was - on a Saturday night.
Mine?
Friday.
This gives me an extra day to refill the pool, replace the crystal thing, turn back the odometer, - and get the dead bodies back - in the ground.
Please don't do this to me.
Tell you what, Malcolm.
- I'll try and keep - the front room closet Off limits as long as I can.
I thought we reserved a deluxe suite.
No, ma'am.
- This is the - Petite Sleeper.
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- Why do they bother - giving you a confirmation number - If they're just going - to give your room away anyway?
Don't be mad at them.
It's not their fault.
Oh, yeah, so it's my fault.
I didn't say that.
- Well, at least - we have a great view Of the parking lot from here.
- At home, I have to crane my neck - to see our car.
Look, you know what?
The room is what it is.
So we just have to try to make the best of it.
- We're here.
We have a - little time to ourselves.
Let's find a way to enjoy it, hmm?
I have to pee.
Of course you do.
Oh, perfect.
- They promised us - a heart-shaped tub.
We got a tub-shaped tub.
For the love of God, will you take a break?
I know you're pregnant.
I know you're uncomfortable.
- I know you're swollen - and puffy and distended And inflated, but you've just got to stop complaining.
- Well, I'm sorry - I'm such a burden.
In another three weeks, - you won't ever have to - suffer through this again.
Well, we don't know that.
What did you say?
I said, I'd move the car.
No, you said, - we don't know - that, but, Hal Hal, we do know that, because you had a vasectomy.
Yes, I did.
Oh, my God, you didn't do it!
You lied to me.
Just a little.
- Hal, you sat - with an ice pack - On your crotch - for three days.
- Well, that should count - for something.
Hal, we talked about this.
We agreed on this.
No, you agreed on it!
I never wanted a vasectomy.
- There are plenty of - other methods out there.
Oh, yeah, they work.
- We've got our - rhythm method child, Our diaphragm child, our condom child.
Oh, yes, and our two abstinence children.
- Lois, you just - don't understand How extraordinarily precious those parts are to me.
Precious?
!
Hal, give me a break.
You're not that guy.
You've never been that guy.
When it comes to this, every guy is that guy.
C-4.
Hit.
E-4.
Hit.
Hey, you guys want to come to a party at my house?
It's going to be amazing.
My parents are gone for the whole weekend.
The whole weekend?
You heard me.
Anything goes.
Total freedom, man.
Interesting.
This'll do.
What's this junk?
What is going on?
- Okay, here's - what's going to happen.
- We have some private business - to conduct.
This is now our garage for the next 48 hours.
- You don't come near it.
- You don't ask about it.
- We get out - before your parents come back.
They never have to find out - that you're the one - who invited us.
- What the hell - are you guys doing?
You know, he just explained it really well, - but all I could hear was - my own heartbeat.
Reese, that stuff is See, that's you guys talking, and that doesn't work for me.
- Now, can I trust - that you guys Won't talk, or am I going to have to remove something - to make it physically - impossible?
And that is not the worst part of the operation.
Once they split open your coin purse, they pull out the vas deferens, put it on the table and chop!
- And they don't - always get it On the first chop, either.
Chop, chop, chop!
- Can I get you guys - another drink?
Set us up, will you?
It's been three hours - since these guys - took over our house.
- So far, there's been - a few fires, I've had a bottle thrown at me - and I've even been threatened - with death.
On the other hand, they haven't stopped raving about Reese's bean dip.
So the evening could go either way.
- Did Fast Eddie - like his salmon?
In about an hour I'm gonna need - you guys to dump a - 50-gallon drum of Stuff.
Do it quick, don't draw attention to yourselves, - and don't breathe in - when you're doing it.
- Look, it's one thing - to ask us - To stay out - of your business, - But when you try - to involve us Okay.
- Hey, Donnie, the soufflÃ©s - are almost up.
- Hmm.
-  Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
It's Oh, no.
Who ordered the girl?
- Not me.
- I didn't do it.
Kathy, hi.
Hey.
You didn't tell me there were going to be other guys here.
- Yeah, well - Just 'cause you - Read something - On a bathroom wall - doesn't mean it's true.
No.
Look, these are cousins of mine.
- You know, - friend cousins.
They dropped in unexpectedly.
- So, you know, right now - isn't a good time.
Obviously not.
- We could still do the dinner - and talking part.
God.
Yeah, man, show some class.
Thank you.
Kathy, listen, you have to trust me on this one.
Hey, bring your girlfriend in here.
Yeah.
Ready or not, here I come.
There you are.
What's wrong?
No one ever found me before.
It's because you're such a good hider.
Yeah, that's probably it.
Just put it anywhere.
- We had a hard time - finding this old girl.
- You can imagine we don't get - much call for it, - This being a couples resort - and all.
Uh-huh.
Not sure I even know - how to operate - the dang thing.
- I'm sure you'll - figure it out.
My gosh, I've been here for over 30 years and I ain't never done this before.
- We see all kind - of couples here, But I've never seen - Thank you.
- I'll finish this.
Fine by me.
- I've got to go up - to Room 318 - And fill the bathtub - with rose petals.
Arm.
Five points for Chuck.
Oh!
Crotch again.
Chuck, Randy, we got to put in the catalyst.
Okay, we can finish this game later.
Don't sit down, Chuck.
You're still in this.
I think it's a party again.
Are you kidding me?
This is a hostage situation.
No.
- Reese, haven't you ever - heard of Stockholm Syndrome?
- You're starting to identify - with your captors.
What captors?
- These guys saved - my life, man.
- Because they decided - not to kill you.
Same thing.
They made us accessories to some kind of felony.
- They're setting up - a decontamination shower In front of the garage.
And poor Kathy must have been completely traumatized.
Where'd she go anyway?
- I'm never going - to forgive myself For dragging her into this.
We have to do something.
- You've got to - relax, Malcolm.
- Some of these guys - are really nice.
- Have you had Big Wanda - tell you your fortune?
- Look, we can't handle this - ourselves.
We don't know how to deal - with a whole bunch - of low-life criminals.
We need help.
You guys did the right thing by calling me.
- Sorry to drag you out here - all the way from the ranch.
This shouldn't take long.
They all in there?
- Yeah, well, - one of them's - In the bedroom - with Kathy.
Who's Kathy?
My date.
Dude.
- What are you - going to do?
- How are you going - to get them out?
- Whoa, whoa, - slow down.
You got to think these things through.
We're going to handle this real delicately.
When you're dealing with a complex psychological situation, you have to remember - there's a lot - of subtle machinations That come into play.
Donnie?
- Francis?
What are - you doing here?
- I heard you were - in Alaska.
No, I'm working at a ranch now.
How you doing?
- You still hanging - out at Kelsey's?
- No.
They went - karaoke.
Oh, this town.
So listen, this is my parents' house.
These are my brothers.
- I know you didn't - know that, - But when you and your buddies - took over the place, - You kind of freaked them out - a little bit.
Oh.
- So, maybe you want - to take this someplace else.
Yeah, you know what?
That just sounds like it's going to be hard, so no.
- Hey, look, dude - I know you don't want me - To get the cops over here, - do you?
- And I'm sure you - wouldn't want me - To tell them who pulled - over the water tower.
That was you, Francis.
Really?
Well, then maybe I should tell them about the highway overpass.
That was also you.
Car wash?
The sinkhole?
All you.
Huh.
Um, okay, well, you guys sit tight and we'll be in the house.
If that's okay.
Well, I think we gave 'em enough to think about.
Hal.
I thought I saw a spider.
You want to just cut our losses and check out in the morning?
I guess.
Should we still do the Afterglow Breakfast?
Well we gotta eat.
Are you sure I'm not too old for Winky Dinks?
- The box says - "For ages eight - And up".
- Well, I'm right - smack-dab - In the middle - of that window.
What the hell is this?
Shh.
We just got them to go to sleep.
- You boys aren't even - supposed to be here - And you're - throwing A coed slumber party?
Who's the fat chick?
Okay, that's it.
I want everybody out of here!
Pronto!
Hey!
No one tells us what to do.
That's right.
Craig, you might want None of your excuses!
You and your little friends are in a boatload of trouble.
- Let's just go back - to Craig's apartment And wait it out till Sunday.
We can't just leave him here!
Dewey, there's a principle I learned in military school.
- The needs of the many - outweigh the needs - Of the guy who - can't run fast.
No!
We face-painted each other.
I'm not leaving him here.
- Dewey, there's nothing - we can do.
Not the crevice tool!
I know what to do.
Seven minutes till checkout.
Do you have the soap, the sewing kit and the stationery?
- Got 'em.
- I also got the shampoos And the shoe cloth.
I couldn't find the shower caps.
- I got 'em.
- Good.
Are you coming?
No.
This is ridiculous.
We came all this way to have one relaxing, romantic weekend and, and we're more tense than when we left the house.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
Yes, there is.
We've got seven minutes left.
- We paid for it.
- We're going to use it.
How?
By doing one nice thing for each other before we go.
And we'd better make it good, because we're not going - to have another chance at it - for 18 years.
Well I suppose I could be persuaded to make a gesture.
Will you rub my feet?
I would love to rub your feet.
What can I do for you?
Please leave my balls alone.
Okay.
Mmm   Sir?
Ma'am?
Checkout was two hours ago, and we really do need the room.
Hello?
!
- What the hell do - you think you're doing?
I think it would be best if you left now.
That's what you think, huh?
Yeah, that's what I think.
Well, I think we're going to take a pass on that.
Okay, Donnie.
Just remember, you drove me to this.
Really?
What exactly did we just drive you to?
I told.
Oh, you told.
I called your moms and I told on you.
You called my mommy, hmm?
-  - Donnie?
!
Mom?
What-what are you doing here?
- Trying to hide how ashamed I am - at your behavior - And wondering - where I went wrong.
Ma, come on.
- Your father and I tried - to give you The best life possible, - and this is how - we're paid back?
Ma, you don't own me.
- I make my own - decisions now.
These are the decisions you make?
This is the life you choose?
!
- Who's covering - your shift At the suit outlet?
Dude you are so busted.
- WOMAN 2: - Don't you be - So smug, David Alan Ferguson.
- Believe me, every one - of your stepfathers Is going to hear about this.
- WOMAN 1: - You say good-bye - To your friends And you get in the car right now!
Yeah, see you later.
Uh, bye.
- I forgot how good - it feels to tell.
-  - Yeah, everything was fine.
You know, kind of boring.
Quiet, boring.
Fun, but boring.
Look who I picked up from the bus station - after not having - seen him - Since I dropped - him off.
Canada was wonderful.
I brought bananas back for everybody.
Do you really want to know?
- Not really.
- No.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
How many more for the record?
Two more tubs should do it.
There really isn't a category for eating jalapenos, - but I think he's probably - suffered enough.
- I'm going to tell - him in a minute.
I'm so close to telling him, honest.
Ninty-seven Really, I'm going to tell him.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now - You're not - the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Mom, Dad, can we drive out to the country this Saturday to see the meteor shower?
We only have to go, like, It starts around 2:00 a.m. How's that again, son?
The meteor shower.
They say it's going - to be the best one - in a hundred years.
Sounds science-y.
No, thanks.
- Come on, Reese, - a meteor shower.
- Fireballs zooming - around the air, Smashing into the ground right in front of you.
That's not what happens.
Can we ride one?
No!
It's 60 miles up, - but it's beautiful - and interesting anyway!
Look, if Malcolm needs to do this for some school assignment, then we're going to do it.
It's not for school.
Then forget it.
- We're not getting up - at 2:00 a.m. - Just to look - at stars.
Bran cereal?
- Why are you - eating that stuff?
- You said it tastes - like kitty litter.
- I'm eating it - because I have to stop Gaining weight.
I've turned into a gigantic, fat cow.
Oh, you have not.
Even the doctor said so.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
- You're eating - for two now.
What kind of doctor doesn't know that?
Hal, he's right.
I'm huge!
And I don't understand how it's happening.
Well, I think you're beautiful no matter what.
Oh, thank you, honey.
You're so sweet.
Oh Anything I want to do, they don't understand.
And if they do understand, they just make fun of it.
- But why should I expect them - to be any different - Than the rest - of the world?
- Let's face it - Everyone on this planet - Is a brain-dead, - butt-scratching half-wit.
Bite us.
How could you possibly think that the Nimzovich defense - would work - against me?
You tried it two games ago, and I slaughtered you.
You tried it four games ago, and I slaughtered you.
Seriously, how do you find your way home at night?
What?
Where-where you going?
What?
Oh, okay!
Who wants to play?
- Eddie, come on.
- I'll tell you what.
- I'll hit myself in the head - with a rock.
I'll even it out.
No?
Chubbo?
You can eat with one hand, play with the other.
- Oh, I can't - believe this.
You're all cowards.
Hey, funny-looking kid, - you want to learn - how to play chess?
No, thanks.
Come on.
- Look, it's not - that hard.
See, this one looks like a pretty little horsey.
I know what a knight is.
- I also know how to counter - a Nimzovich defense Without leaving my queen's bishop wide open.
- Your whole left flank - was Swiss cheese.
Hey, junior champion.
Read your Kasparov.
The second you go after my bishop, you can kiss your rook and two pawns bye-bye!
Oh, okay, I get it.
You're scared to play me!
Yeah, I'm really scared of some troll in the park beating me at chess.
- Evidently, - you are!
Now you're confusing fear with pity.
Fear triggers a fight or flight response while pity allows me to turn my back and walk away with a sadness for your misery!
I would've kicked your ass.
All right, that's it.
Couldn't see that coming.
It's so nice to have the kids out of the Dewey!
What are you doing?
!
Painting the wall.
- What is the matter - with you?
Why on earth would you do this?
The baby told me to.
The ba?
What, this baby?
It chose the color, too.
- I would have gone with more - of an earth tone.
Look Listen, son, I know you're worried about the baby coming, but you don't have to be.
Yes, you're not going to be the youngest anymore, and it is true the baby will get all of our attention for quite a while, and you will have to do a lot more work - around the house, and probably - have to share the bathroom - What your father's - trying to say is, There is no reason for you to be acting out like this.
Now get this mess cleaned up.
And the baby is not talking to you.
It said you'd say that.
Draw.
Draw?
Draw.
Draw.
One more.
No!
It's been four hours!
All right, all right.
God.
Who designed these damn cement benches anyway?
- Probably some - stupid civil servant Never made it through design class.
Now he takes his frustrations out - on the asses - of the general public.
- What the hell - is with that guy?
He is so annoying.
First it's too warm, then it's too cool, - then the pigeons - are walking funny.
- He didn't shut up - for one second.
- I mean, give it a try, - stop complaining.
- No, you want to know - the worst thing about him?
He kept picking at his Four-nine-seven- three-six-seven Stop doing that.
Sorry.
- I'll be back in - a couple of hours.
Wait.
Where you going?
I told you, I'm posing in Otto's art class tonight.
Posing?
As in naked?
Yes.
We had this conversation.
No, we haven't.
- I remember conversations - with the word "naked" in them.
- You can't strip - in front of Otto.
I'm not spinning my tassels on a runway, Francis.
I'm modeling at an art class.
It's a job.
They pay $250.
-  - Piama, I want to make sure I have the right pastels.
- What color - are your nipples?
- It's all - very tasteful, - Which is beside - the point, - Because, guess what, - it's my body, - So you can't tell me - what to do with it.
- If you're not - mature enough To handle this, then that's your problem.
$250?
!
Everything I knew about beauty was a lie.
So this morning, Dewey tried to go to school in his underwear because apparently the baby doesn't like his wardrobe.
- The kid is driving me - up the wall, - And I keep gaining weight - like crazy.
- More than a - pound a day.
- Nobody gains - a pound a day.
- It doesn't make - any sense.
Ah, I know, honey.
It is baffling, but look, you've just got to stop obsessing about this weight thing.
- Let me pour you - some juice.
- I don't want - any juice, Hal.
I know what's going on.
You do?
Of course I do.
I'm not an idiot.
I-I'm sorry.
It's just It's because I'm not working.
Huh?
It's obvious, Hal.
- I'm not getting the exercise - I got - With the other - pregnancies.
With the other kids, I was on my feet all day.
Th-That makes perfect sense.
Celery stick?
My system must be so screwed up.
This celery tastes exactly like bacon.
Honey, listen to me.
Don't make yourself crazy over a few pounds.
You look amazing to me.
No matter how big and round and jiggly you get.
Hello.
Hi, Mom.
- Tell the baby I got - the stupid pail of sand, But now the buses have stopped running so I can't get home.
Dewey?
!
Where are you?
!
I don't know exactly.
Somewhere down by the pier.
You're at the pier?
!
Where?
Dewey, listen to me.
You stay right where you are.
- We're coming to get you - right now.
Okay, but bring another pair of socks.
I stepped in fish guts.
Ew.
What is wrong with that kid?
I'm really getting worried.
Let's just stay calm.
- We'll get in the car, - go pick up some doughnuts, And we'll figure this out on the way.
Another draw?
Hey, Casey Kasem, why don't you do everybody a favor and turn that crap down?
It's not loud.
I didn't say it was loud.
I said it was crap.
So, uh, is this all you do every day?
Just hang out in the park and play chess with strangers?
No.
I also enjoy long walks on the beach and bubble baths.
Of course, I'd have to say my greatest turn-on is honesty.
- So basically, - the only human contact you have Is playing chess with people who can't stand you?
I hate to burst your little after-school-special bubble, but I'm not some kind of loser.
I have a perfect life.
I have a great job selling toner over the phone.
I make a few calls Bing, bang, bing, it's 10:00.
- I've got the rest - of the day to myself.
- You can't possibly make - enough money doing that.
I thought you were a little smarter than that, Malcolm.
It's not about money.
It's about freedom.
I am my own man.
I do what I want, when I want.
I don't answer to anyone for anything, ever.
Where's my 20 bucks, Leonard?
- You said you'd - have it on Monday.
- Yeah, I have it, - It's right here.
- I you know, I was - I was looking for you.
You know, I couldn't find you, - and then I had some - important business meetings That I had to get to, but here 13, 14 Um, uh, you take cigarettes, right?
I quit.
Oh, good for you.
- That's so good - because, you know, - These things will - kill you slow.
- Th-That's the truth, - you know, and And the cost is Give him six bucks!
Take it easy, George.
What a dumbass!
- Well, I'm afraid - time's up, everyone, But once again, let's thank our models for their hard work.
Thank you.
I'm just glad I had this opportunity to give something back.
- You were just wonderful, - as always.
Well, that's what I do.
- Oh, and Piama did well, - too, don't you think?
- Francis, you have inspired me - to new heights.
See how I have captured - the confident power - of your torso, - The sheer arrogance - of your ass.
-  - Francis, Come on, let's go.
- I'm talking to people here, - if you don't mind.
Sadly, someone's doing this with his soul, and somebody isn't.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dewey.
You get in that house right now, mister!
The baby did not tell you to drive the car!
- Well, it didn't exactly - use the word "car".
It called it a "go machine," but that's what it meant.
What's this?
- Somebody had a birthday - at the office, And nobody ate it because it's "fat-free".
- How come it doesn't say - "happy birthday" or anything?
Well, you know, office politics, but you wouldn't believe how PC some of these jerks can get.
Look at this.
I'm looking.
You're really improving, Rubio.
- You've stopped making - the "vroom" noises When you move your pieces.
Hey, Leonard.
Oh, you got to see this.
Physically hurts, doesn't it?
- Listen, I was talking - to this guy I know.
I got you a job interview.
- What the hell are - you talking about?
You are a miserable person.
You barely have a job, and you're completely dysfunctional when it comes to communicating with people.
And that's my fault?
It's not everyone else in the world?
- It doesn't have - to be like that.
If you have a job where you're around people, you can get used to each other and maybe turn things around.
- Forget it.
- I'm not wasting my time - On some stupid job interview - because you have Some desperate need to save yourself through me.
Why don't you invest some of that neurotic energy in confronting your own fear of failure?
Oh, goodness, the clouds have parted, and I can now commit to a new life, thanks to your Oprah-esque psychological insights.
And now you're trying to invalidate the real issue by dancing around it with what you think is clever wordplay.
Screw this.
I'll play you for it.
- Why bother?
We - draw every game.
- Not this time.
- Fine.
But if you don't win, - you never bring - this crap up again.
You're on.
Where's my money, Leonard?
George, uh, I got it, uh, just the other Run!
So, how much does this job pay?
What are you doing?
Can you hold these for a second?
Sure.
What's this for, anyway?
You'll see.
Are you crazy?
It wasn't my idea.
The baby told me to.
Wait a minute Mom's baby?
You think Mom's baby talks to you?
Yes!
- It's telling me to do - all these crazy things.
- Let me give you - a little advice.
You've got to ignore the voices.
They are not on your side, and you never tell anyone about them Especially your teachers.
They get panicky for no reason.
You understand?
- I think so.
- Attaboy.
You're going to be okay.
This is a terrible idea.
- No, this is - just what you need.
- Remember?
- A job, people, a life.
But why here?
- Because this is - the only guy I know - That would trade - a job interview - For a Hong Kong Fooey - lunch box.
Greetings, Earthlings.
You've got to be kidding me.
- Trust me, I know - it's going to be hard, But if you can just keep your mouth shut for five minutes with this guy, you're home free.
I'm waiting, princess.
My rÃ©sumÃ©.
Forget this.
You can't learn anything from a rÃ©sumÃ©.
So, tell me about your employment history.
Well, I Interesting.
You know, I like to think of Lucky Aide as a kind of family, and in this family, I'd be your father, and as a father, there might be things - I might ask of you - that don't make sense, But you do it because I'm your father.
No sassing back, just do it.
Understand?
Think so.
Now, who are you in this family?
Are you the second cousin?
Or maybe the kooky aunt?
Well, you know, I've always kind of seen myself in the role of the younger brother Eager to learn.
I never had a brother.
Well, I'm here.
We can get started in a moment.
Francis, I-I didn't call you.
Yes, I noticed.
I can't do your job and mine, Gloria.
What?
There's no Camembert?
You expect me to have my wine without any Camembert?
- That ruins - my entire aesthetic!
- Francis - Forget it.
I'll work without cheese.
Who is this?
That's Jeremy, our model for the evening.
That's why I didn't call you.
-  - Francis, We have already sketched your fabulous haunches, and now it is time for us to examine the interplay of light and shadow on Jeremy's love handles.
That's it?
That's how it ends?
You just casually discard me like yesterday's fish?
After you've sucked out the essence of my soul?
- Francis, please, - try to understand.
No, I don't understand!
I let you see every color in the spectrum of my being, and you have rejected it!
Someday, you'll realize what you turned your back on, - and you will - curse yourself For your banality and your shortsightedness, but by then it will be too late because I will be gone!
Yes, gone!
Um can I have my robe?
Craig's been yammering nonstop for almost an hour.
- He even made Leonard - follow him into the bathroom, But Leonard's tough.
Now, let's talk about respect Not self-respect but respect for one's superiors.
- Now I remember a - time think quick!
That's just a little - management test - I came up with - To see whether you're - the type of person Who confronts problems head-on or avoids them.
Which one were you?
Both.
Good.
And I see that you have no spine.
Welcome aboard.
Come back in an hour, and we'll get you a trainee vest and a name tag.
Congratulations.
I knew you could do it.
- Oh, my God, that - guy is an idiot.
You only had to do an interview with him.
Trying having dinner with that jackass and his stupid cat.
The cat can't be any stupider than this guy.
This moron just tried to use a Barbie doll to explain the hygiene procedures.
Brother, huh?
I think I'll stay an only child, thank you.
Mom!
Dad!
Dewey!
Oh, right.
- I have had it - with you, Dewey.
I have enough on my mind without having to deal with this!
But the baby says Listen to me.
- That baby is not - talking to you.
Honey, just try to calm down, okay?
I'll make you some tea.
You have to stop using this as an excuse to get attention, - because it is not - going to work!
- Now, I don't want to - hear another word About you talking to that baby, understand?
- The baby says - to turn around.
What?
Hal.
Well, you don't take yours with maple syrup?
Craig was pretty upset.
He wouldn't come out of the photo booth for two hours.
Where's Leonard?
Has anyone seen Leonard?
He told me to give this to you.
"Malcolm, I moved away, "but I want to thank you - "for confirming - everything I said - "about people being - giant jackasses.
- "One day you'll - understand.
People like us will never belong".
What does he mean, "people like us"?
What?
I hate when you do that.
- If you have something - to say, just say it.
That is so annoying.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
- Oh, for God's sake, - what was that?
!
Wherever you are, whatever you've done, don't think I won't find you.
Life is unfair.
- We're so glad Francis decided - to come down for a visit.
- It's been so long - since we've seen him.
And you tagging along is an added bonus.
Well, making you happy makes me happy.
- You know, I don't - think that nursery - Would ever get done - without Francis' help.
- Hal has this thing - about heights.
I can't reach it.
- Dad, you have to come up - another rung.
My ears are popping!
- So my doctor said - I only have to wear - These special shoes - for two more years.
Then I'm down to nights and weekends.
- Great Scott!
- You got a letter From Martindale Academy!
What's Martindale Academy?
It's the greatest, - most advanced private - school in existence.
- Do you know how many - millions they've spent - To make sure you've - never heard about it?
It says I've been accepted.
I didn't even apply.
No one applies.
They find you.
- This is - unbelievable.
- Malcolm, you're going - to the show.
You're set for life!
Wait, what am I thinking?
- You can't go.
- You're too poor.
You're like the poorest guy I know.
Oh, I'm such a jerk!
- Here I am, describing - this nirvana - You'll never be - able to experience.
Holding out this hope of power and success - to a guy in - a three-dollar shirt.
I mean, look at this hovel!
Lloyd, you have to stop talking.
It's okay to cry, Malcolm.
Tears are free.
Okay, everybody.
- Just got back - from the doctor And everything's fine, but baby's a little bit bigger than expected.
-  So, instead of having - the baby in two weeks Like we thought, we're going - to induce labor - on Thursday.
Thursday?
!
This Thursday?
!
You can't do that!
- Oh, what difference - does it make?
It's just six days sooner that our lives are over.
Hal.
And our new, more fulfilling lives begin.
This stinks.
-  - I know this is being Sprung on you very suddenly, - and you all have a right - to be a little upset.
- A little?
!
- Don't push it.
- Hal, you know what?
- I've got an idea.
- Why don't you - take the boys - Out tomorrow and - do something fun?
- I could use the time - alone anyway To straighten up the house before the baby comes.
- I can help - you clean.
- Well, that'll take - a little longer, - But I guess I could - use the company.
-  - Hey, there's a car show At the convention center.
Yeah, let's spend the whole day - looking at cool things - that we'll never get to own.
- Oh, come on, Malcolm, if we only - looked at stuff we could afford, - All we'd ever - see is crap.
-  - Don't be a party pooper.
It'll be great.
"Festival of Brides"?
- That's the lamest - name for a car show - I've ever heard.
- No, the car show - was here last week.
Let's get out of here.
No.
I just dropped 15 bucks on parking.
We're going in.
I know it's your fifth child, but still, you must be a little excited.
Well, sure, every child is exciting.
Not that you want to rush into something like that.
Oh!
Wow.
You okay?
The baby just started kicking like crazy.
- It's almost - like something - Was upsetting Mom!
Are you going to open the door or should I lie down in the grass and feed the worms?
Oh, great.
Who opened the gates of hell?
Mom?
This is a surprise.
What are you doing here?
I'm moving in.
- What do you mean - you're moving in?
You are family, you will take care of me.
This is ridiculous.
You have a condo.
It's nicer than this house.
It burned down.
Mother, you can't just How did your house burn down?
- It was the villagers, - wasn't it?
It's a mystery.
- Why don't you go stay - at Susan's?
She has four extra bedrooms and a satellite dish.
- Your sister should stick - her head in a can of beans!
What?
!
She's always been your favorite.
- She's the only one you called - when Dad died.
She isn't my favorite anymore!
She called me bitter!
Then she hung up on me.
On me!
Or maybe I hung up on her.
Who remembers?
Either way, she should rot in hell.
Mother, we can't afford to put you up here.
You can afford a maid.
I'm not the maid, Ida.
My name is Piama.
I'm married to Francis.
Tell the help not to talk to me.
Yahoo Celebrate good times, come on It's a celebration - I know I haven't - been everywhere, But I'm pretty sure this is the most boring place on Earth.
- What are you talking about, - Reese?
Do you know what kind of craftsmanship goes into these lace veils?
Huh?
So, uh, Dad, I was wondering, do you have any kind of savings put away?
Ooh, I'll have to tell your mother that one.
No, I'm serious.
What if something came up?
Like a big, unexpected expense?
Are you prepared for something like that?
- Don't worry - about that stuff, son.
- Things have a way - of taking care of themselves.
- But - Come on.
You boys are young.
You're at a bridal expo.
You should be having the time of your lives.
Dewey?
Dewey?
What are those wires for?
- You see that big spotlight - up there?
- I'm in charge - of that puppy.
You like it?
I really do.
I'd like to tell you a little story.
FRANCIS : Are you going to let her get away with this?
You are, aren't you?
She's my mother.
- You know the way I am - around her.
Okay, if that's what you want.
That woman being one of - the first people - your new baby sees - When it comes - into this world.
Smiling down at it, cradling it in her arms.
You're right.
She's got to go.
-  - Mom.
- There's something important - that I have to tell you.
What is it?
You are a horrible mother!
- You've always been - a horrible mother!
My whole childhood you'd bully me and ignore me - and trivialize - my feelings - And do nothing - but heap praise On my sister until I felt like I was worthless in comparison!
Well, now she's worthless.
I've got a right to change my mind.
But just because your sister disgusts me more than you do doesn't give you the right to talk to me like this!
I will talk to you any damn way I want, you hateful old woman!
You are leaving!
Wow!
I don't know how I finally summoned the strength to do that, but it feels great!
Now I'm not asking you, I'm telling you!
Get out of my house!
No.
What?
You heard me.
I said "no".
What do you mean, "no"?
You don't have any choice.
What are you going to do?
Pick me up and throw me out?
Are you going to toss an old woman out into the street?
In front of your neighbors?
Sounds good to me.
- Whoa!
- You brought this - On yourself, You old monster.
- You have no idea - how good this makes me    Attention, ladies and gentlemen.
It's your "clucky" day.
Chicken dance lessons are being given every ten minutes at the Fielding Dance Academy pavilion.
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hey, can you get me a piece with a flower?
- I'm talking - to an actual customer right now.
I'm a customer.
Yeah?
Are you getting married?
Why, does somebody like me?
Hey, what are you, about five-seven?
Yeah.
Perfect.
I own a tux shop.
- One of my models - didn't show up.
- I'll give you 20 bucks - if you walk around The floor in a tux and pass out my card.
Buzz off.
- 20 bucks?
- He'll do it.
Need anybody in my size?
It's very simple.
You just walk up to somebody, get down on one knee, - hand them one of my cards - and say, "I propose that you get your tuxedo from Wojodubakowski's".
No problem.
Everyone around the world, come on I think the accordion is really underrated.
Yes!
Yes, it is!
Yahoo!
What are you doing today at 3:16?
Hey, sir, how about some cake?
Sure.
- Can I have a piece - with the flower?
No.
You get one with a flower and a little lemon bee on it.
Mom, wake up.
Take the children.
Just let me live.
Remember, I didn't want to do this.
- Do what?
-  That's the police.
You see what you've driven me to?
I've actually called the police on my own mother.
- They're here - to cart you away.
How could you do this to me?
!
After everything I've done for you?
We're family, for God's sake!
Good.
You're here.
- That's them.
- Get 'em out of here.
What?
!
- They've been - stealing from me.
- I want them out - of my house.
Wait a minute.
No, this is my house!
Folks, let's just slow down.
I have the deed.
It's in the safety deposit box at the Valley Federal Bank.
Number 24866.
You can check.
No!
I have the deed!
It's, uh, yeah, uh It's in a shoe box.
It's under-under my bed - Well, I don't know where it is, - but this is my house!
You devious, ungrateful girl!
- She's done - nothing but lie - Since the day - I took her in.
And her big boyfriend - thinks he's - so tough.
How tough is it to hit an old woman.
You dirty old!
This is what she does.
You have to stop her.
You have to stop her!
As I was saying, she is a very clever woman, and if you knew her as I do, you too would be suspicious of her story.
- And on Monday, - when the bank opens, Whoever actually has the deed can go get it.
- Then you apply - for a court order - And the whole thing - should be straightened out In six to eight months.
- You can get - up now, sir.
- And if you hurt - a single hair On that old lady's head, I'll be back.
Off duty.
Pass the rolls.
You think that bothers me?
Guess why your soup tasted different - when you came back - from bathroom.
Ugh.
- There has to - be some way to - Get rid of her.
- Well, we know - she doesn't burn.
- Let's just face it.
- We're stuck with her.
You can't give up.
- You can - totally do this.
- I'm sorry.
- I just don't know what to do.
She's too powerful.
- Every monster - has its weakness.
Frankenstein has fire.
Dracula, the cross.
There has to be something that Grandma's afraid of.
So, what would you like me to do for you?
Well, it's, uh  - It's kind of hard - to say, Abe, um - It-it has to do - with my mother.
Oh, I know about mothers.
Every time - mine comes over - to Sunday dinner, She always brings that pecan pie with real whipped cream.
- And she knows - that's my one weakness.
Our grandma's kind of like that.
- Except she's a wrinkled sack - of hatred - Kept alive only by the will - to destroy.
We just want her out of the house, and she refuses to leave.
: And I have this idea.
You see, she's a horrible bigot.
I mean, she's terrified of black people.
Oh.
What do you want me to?
Oh.
Oh-oh, I see.
B-Because I'm Well, you want me to Well, I-I suppose I Really?
I'd do it, but I'm not dark enough.
I just annoy her.
And then I said, "Orange you glad I didn't say 'banana'"?
Hey.
- I found these - in the trash.
Can we discuss this later?
I'm with friends.
Give me the tux.
What?
- Thank you.
- No!
I like this tux.
It's mine.
It's not yours.
Now give it back, or I'll call security.
Hey, I'm over there!
Hey you Hey!
- Tell me which - one you like.
And be honest.
Dad, I just want to know.
- Do you have any kind - of financial plan at all?
- Any plan - about anything?
- Malcolm, I'm telling - you for the last time, - Stop worrying - about money.
- Hey, I do your taxes.
- I know what you and Mom make.
I know how much you're spending, - and I have a pretty good idea - what it costs to have a baby.
- You guys are going to - be at least 70 bucks - In the hole - every month.
- By the time the baby - starts school, - You're going to be $18,000 - in debt, - And that's where - they'll cut you off.
- You're going to be bankrupt - and ruined.
Something will come up.
You can't keep saying that.
- Fine.
I'm a failure - as a father.
I'm a terrible provider.
Is that what you want to hear?
No.
But I have a way to fix it.
What's this?
It's from the Martindale Academy.
It's this amazing prep school but it's in London.
- They're offering me - a complete scholarship.
Tuition, housing, everything.
If I'm not home you just might make it.
I'm totally willing to do it.
Absolutely not.
You don't get to leave.
- But you - Malcolm, you're our only hope.
- Hold this.
- Sure.
- Now let me explain - something to you.
Whenever your mother or I say "Something will come up" or "Things will work out," that is our code for "Malcolm will think of something".
- But - We need you.
The family is only a family as long as we all stick together.
Where's Dewey?
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll please turn your attention to the man with the balloon, and listen to the following heart-wrenching story.
Hello.
My name is Dewey.
And the man with the balloon is my father, Hal.
Dewey?
Where are you?
See, - I'm the youngest - of four kids, And I always get the short end of everything.
I've never had a hot shower or a bed to myself.
- I'm the third person - to wear this underwear.
And yet, I've never complained.
Dewey, what is this about?
!
Even when my parents decided to have another baby.
I was happy to share what little I have.
And then they told me they're inducing labor.
And they picked a really interesting day to do it.
Do you remember what day you picked, Dad?
Dewey!
What day did you pick, Dad?
It's Thursday.
Just come down from wherever you are.
Of all the days you could have picked, - you chose - this Thursday.
Anything interesting about Thursday, Dad?
Will you stop this?
- Anything at all - you can think of That might be happening this Thursday?
Okay, Dewey, what is the big deal about Thursday?
: It's my birthday.
It is not your Oh, God!
Well, ladies and gentleman that's the story of the little boy who lost his birthday.
If you have any thoughts or comments, my dad would love to hear them.
This would be a good time for one of those ideas we were talking about.
I've got nothing.
-  - Thank you so much - For coming over.
I know this is a little weird.
Actually, I'm kind of excited.
This is kind of like - when I did Spoon River Anthology - in college.
Do we have to hear that story again?
We sold out both shows.
Four pillows on one bed.
This is why you can't feed your children.
Oh, hi, Mom.
- I'd like you to meet - some of our friends.
This is Brian and this is Abe.
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
If you'll excuse me.
I need to use your toilet.
I've been telling Abe all about you.
Welcome to da hood yo, yo.
Gettin' all jiggly with it.
Representin'.
Uh uh Can't touch this.
- Abe?
- Huh?
- : - Chill.
Hello.
Everybody decent?

I hope you don't mind.
That's why you have it.
So you can come over anytime you want.
Mom, these are our neighbors.
Steve lives next door.
Malik is on the other side.
And Trey lives across the street.
-  - Why, Lois, you make it sound Like you're surrounded.
Allow me.
Well, hello.
And who is this fine lady?
So what you doing later on?
'Cause I like that wagon you draggin'.
Mom, where are you going?
I can't believe you live like this.
- I would rather sleep - in a bus station Or a Dumpster.
- Well, there's - obviously Nothing I can do to change your mind, but I'm heartbroken.
You only just got here.
I What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Everything is perfectly fine.
Francis, - you have to listen - very carefully.
God, I'm having a contraction.

Bye, Mom.
Great to see you.
Have a safe trip.
Don't forget to call us whenever you get to wherever   Maybe I'll stay few more minutes.
- Well, Dewey, - I hope you're happy.
I thought I would be, but not this much.
Let's find Reese and get out of here.
Why is my cell phone off?
-  - The contraction started At 3:27.
Oh, this one can tell time.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Hal.
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Now, honey, - I don't want you - to get too excited, - But I think you should - come home now, Because, I'm well, I'm - : - I'm having the baby.
What?

O kay.
Well, just stay calm, too.
Yeah, getting worked up will only accelerate things.
Just relax.
Do your breathing.
- Where the hell - is Reese?
- What's wrong?
Your mom is having the baby now.
See?
Was that so hard?
- Now, Hal, I don't want you - to panic.
You drive safely.
There's no reason to rush.
Rush?
Come on.
You know me better than that.
Find your brother!
So, I'm just going to make myself some tea and relax until you get here.
Good idea.
- You know, chamomile - always relaxes me.
- Reese!
Damn it, - Reese, where are you?
!
- I'm thinking - of taking Sixth Street home.
- You want me to stop - and pick up some ice cream?
- Reese!
- Where are you?
: Over here.
Reese?
!
- I'm inside - the giant violin case.
- Damn it!
- Get him out of there.
- So, is that a yes - on the ice cream?
No, I'm fine.
Just come on home carefully.
- Oh.
- Sure thing.
Honey, can you hold on a second?
Ow!
Hey, what are you doing?
Boys, run!
The boys send their love, too.
- Hey!
Hey, you - come back here!
Your kid ran off with my $600 tuxedo!
So, we're just pulling out of the garage right now.
Got it on the oldies station.
- They're doing - a Beatles "A" to "Z".
- Can you think of a Beatles song - that starts with "Z"?
'Cause, frankly, I can't.
Hal You sound funny.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, just turning onto Maple.
Hey, the gas station by the church stopped selling diesel.
-  - Ow!
Shotgun!
- Wow, honey, you wouldn't believe - the huge pothole We just went over.
Let's go, Dad!
Oh!
I can't find the keys!
Keys?
- Where the hell - are the keys?
!
-  - I got 'em.
Now let's go!
Hal?
Honey, can I call you back?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
- Previously - on Malcolm in the Middle - Baby's a little bit - bigger than expected.
So we're going to induce labor on Thursday.
Festival of Brides?
- I just dropped 15 bucks - on parking.
We're going in.
Baby just started kicking like crazy.
- It's almost like - something was - Upsetting Mom!
I'm moving in.
Everybody decent?
- God, I'm having a contraction.
- I'm going into labor.
- What?
- I have to get to the hospital.
- Got it on - the oldies station.
- They're doing a - Beatles "A" to "Z".
So I'm just going to make myself some tea and relax until you get here.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question?
You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now - You're not the boss - of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
- These contractions - are coming so close together!
Oh!
- Lois, you have to stop - doing that.
- You are really - freaking me out.
- Yeah, me, too, Lois.
- And I'm a doctor.
We can't wait for Hal anymore.
We've got to go to the hospital now!
- You really think - you're ever going - To see your husband again?
- Mom!
He's a man, isn't he?
He's had his way with you.
- What's he need - to stick around for?
- Look, if you're not going - to have the decency - To choke on the fumes - of your own bile, Can you at least take your poison over to Aunt Susan's?
Did she ask me to come?
Did she call you?
No.
No, of course not.
She only wants to see me suffer.
Can you imagine how she's laughing at me, knowing that now I'm stuck with you as my favorite.
Knock, knock.
- Lois, I need to borrow - a coat hanger.
I dropped my sandwich underneath my car seat.
What's going on here?
Lois is in labor, and Hal's not here.
I have dreamed of this moment!
- Here's what - we're going to do.
- I'm going to carry you - in my arms to my van.
I have one of the three original sirens from Starsky and Hutch.
I can make that trip in seven minutes flat.
You're talking crazy!
There were only two sirens used in that entire series, - and they're both - in the Smithsonian.
Au contraire.
There were four sirens.
Oh, Hal, where are you?
Well, let's go!
Your mother's in labor!
We just wasted 45 minutes in the security office.
- Just our luck - We get a rent-a-cop Trying to make sergeant.
I think he made you pee in that jar just because he could.
- You boys have really outdone - yourselves this time.
- Now, I'm going to take your mom - to the hospital, - And I'm not going - to hear one word - Out of any of you until we come - back with the baby.
- Okay, Dr. Kerr's going - to meet you at the hospital.
The guys are packing your bag, - and Craig is cleaning out - his car to make room for you.
Two more trips and we're good to go.
We're ready.
What are you doing with all those suitcases?
I told you she didn't need both sundresses.
Hey, don't look at me.
When I fly, I take one carry-on.
That's it.
I'm ready to go to the hospital.
What?
- You're not going - to the hospital.
I'm not going?
You're not going.
- Oh, you want to go to - the hospital so bad?
- I'll send you - to the hospital.
I'll send you to the hospital!
Nobody's going to the hospital!
It's too late.
Somebody call the paramedics.
I'm having the baby here.
Boys, call me a taxi, - and then call Dr. Kerr, let him - know your mom's in labor.
He's in the book.
Then call AAA Dad, calm down.
I will not calm down!
Hello.
Hello?
!
Oh!
Hello!
Lois?
What?
!
Honey!
Sir, stop moving.
- MALCOLM AND  - What'd she say?
!
My wife's at home, and she's having our baby right now!
I have to get home to her!
- She's having the - baby at home?
- Sir, you're not going anywhere - in the shape you're in.
- Give him ten milligrams - of diazepam.
Let me out of here.
I'm fine!
Wait.
What is that?
What-what is that?
Wha-What does that do?
Breathe in a bit.
I've got to get home to her!
Give him ten more.
I want him immobilized.
Why don't you boys come with me?
We have all sorts of fun magazines in the waiting area.
You like Highlights?
You like "Goofus and Gallant"?
- We don't want to read - stupid magazines.
- Our mom is - having a baby!
I'm sure she's being very well taken care of, and so's your father, - so there's nothing - for you boys to do But relax and wait for someone to come and get you.
But we have to do something.
This is all our fault.
- You're obviously - very upset young men, And frankly, I have no idea how to deal with you.
- That's why - I'm not in pediatrics.
Now, let's go into the waiting room like I told you.
If you don't want to look at magazines, I'm sure there's a chair you can spin around in.
- My God, what does - this woman weigh?
!
- I'm losing my grip - on her thigh!
- Let's get her - to the bed!
- Let's get her in - there!
Let's go!
- Move it, move it, - move it!
- All right, all right, all right!
- Count of three, count of three.
-  - One, two three!
That was like moving a concert grand.
Just relax, Mom.
- The paramedics will be here soon - and they'll know what to do.
- Don't worry, Lois, - I just Googled the word "baby".
Here we go.
28 million matches There ought to be - something useful in there.
- Craig, get off - That thing.
We don't need it.
Trey's a doctor.
Oh, no, Lois, I'm a dentist.
- But you have medical training, - don't you?
Yes, but I took up dentistry specifically because well, that area down there, whe-when I look at it, I get giggly.
I just do since high school.
Oh, for God's sakes.
I doubt I'm the only one.
The paramedics are oh.
Hi, is Malcolm home?
No, and we're in I just need to use his notes for my biochem homework.
This really isn't a good time.
- You don't say hello - to your own grandmother?
I'm not Malcolm.
We've been through this before.
: Oh, God, the baby is pressing down so hard on my cervix!
Well, good, looks like everything's under control here.
- Piama and I are - going to head out Back to the ranch.
What are you talking about?
- Nothing!
- You think I'm running away?
You think being here when my own mother gives birth is-is making me so intensely uncomfortable I've made up a fake excuse to leave?
That is not even a tiny bit true.
Okay, clothes for babies, names for babies, truck drivers dressed like ew.
- Excuse me, can - somebody help me - Find Malcolm's - biochem notes?
I need them to do my assignment.
Get out of here, Lloyd!
I'm in labor!
I'm about to give birth!
It's a really important assignment.
- We are the worst kids - in the world.
Mom was right.
We really are evil little trolls who have absolutely - no consideration - for anything But ourselves, and destroy everything we come in contact with, and we're lucky if we don't end up in prison or dead.
Here's what we're going to do.
There's a class that starts here in ten minutes.
- It's all about how to be parents - to newborn babies.
We're going to take it.
What are you talking about?
- We're going to learn - how to help out.
We're going to learn how to be good for once.
- All right!
- Yeah, this baby's - Not going to get - Dropped on its head - all the time.
Yeah!
What?
- Take a deep breath, - and blow it out - Like you're blowing out - a candle.
Oh!
Oh!
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!
I thought my fingers were going to explode!
- Way to breathe through it.
-  - Hey, hey, I found something!
- There's been a slight increase - in the incidence Of babies born with a tail.
I wonder if that makes it easier to tell when they're happy?
- Where the hell - are those paramedics?
- They'll be here - any second.
Steve called them ten minutes ago.
Yeah, that's right.
That's what I did ten minutes ago.
- So, when did you get - this wallpaper?
So, anyway, we just feel awful, and that's why we really want to take this class.
- Oh, my God, - you should feel awful.
You're horrible children.
That's our point.
Well, I suppose everyone deserves another chance.
All right, you can take the class.
- Thank you.
- Ah, we're in.
- Yes!
When your milk duct is blocked, it's called mastitis.
- It's important - that you let your baby Suck the obstruction out of the breast, and don't be alarmed if the baby then vomits up a cottage cheese-type substance.
Now, join me over here Like I needed another reason to hate cottage cheese.
I've been kind of zoning in and out here, but did she just say milk comes out of those things?
Reese, that's what they're for.
My God!
Women are the cows of people!
Oh!
I'm coming, Lois.
I'm coming, Lois!
- I'm coming, - Lois!
I'm coming, Lois!
I'm coming, Lois!
I'm coming!
I'm coming, Lois!
- : - I'm coming!
I'm coming, Lois!
I'm coming!
I'm c : I'm coming Lois.
Here, I brought some towels - to put under - your knees.
Oh, Piama, don't use the good towels.
What does she know about towels?
Her people dried themselves off by throwing dirt on their backs.
Thank you, Piama.
Thank you very much.
I'm sure the paramedics will come get you very soon, and before they do, there's something I want you to know.
Your father had a second family.
What?
!
This slutty cocktail waitress in Manitoba.
- She was nothing - but a pig, And the children that came out of her - Why are you - telling me this now?
In case you die, - I don't want you - thinking of him As a decent man, but don't tell your sister.
Let her stew in her own ignorance.
I only tell this to my favorite.
What are you doing?
Building calms me down, okay?
We're all trying to find ways to cope with this.
Yes, Francis, I'm trying to cope with this pregnancy by giving birth!
Excuse me.
I'm working quietly.
I'd appreciate it if you could work quietly, too.
Got to get out I gotta get out.
I gotta get out.
H-Hey!
How's it going?
- You gotta get me - out of here.
I don't belong in here.
I have to get home.
- It's okay, little fellow.
- You'll be fine As long as someone claims you in the next six hours.
- Six hours?
- What happens then?
Wait!
What happens then?
!
Oh, boys!
Boys!
- Over here.
- Pick me, pick me.
Wow, look at this guy.
Yeah!
- That is the ugliest dog - I've ever seen.
What did he roll in?
I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, look at this one.
No!
No, please come back.
Please, please, please!
Can someone shut this yappy one up?
That's right, Dewey.
Come back to Daddy.
Pick Daddy.
Can we take this one's collar and put it on the good one?
Collar?
What?
No!
No!
: No!
No!
No!
No!
My biggest fear is that I won't be a good big brother.
Babies are born stupid - and they're - really counting on you.
- They'll touch stuff - they shouldn't.
They'll eat anything.
I'd say half of all our Legos have been through this kid.
Probably more.
Can I get a new baby?
Lois, Let go!
- Or at least - grab his hand!
They say that childbirth is the most painful thing a person can go through.
With a little light pancake, you could pass.
You don't have to hang out with the other ones, you know.
Okay, you know what?
See, here's the thing Lady we're better than you.
Every one of us in every way.
I'm smarter than you, more educated, and I contribute more to society.
I have a family that loves me.
I live in a big house, - drive a nice car - and make more money in a year Than you've probably made your whole lifetime.
Big deal.
So you're a drug dealer.
Booga-booga!
-  - Hal, where are you?
Put the ice on it.
- The paramedics'll - be here any minute, So just hang on.
I can't hang on.
- It doesn't work - like that.
This baby is coming now.
- Lois, you don't want - to push until you're At least ten centimeters dilated.
Well, take a look if you want.
Uh I-I I'd be happy to look in your mouth.
Do you know those animals are in your backyard right now pacing back and forth like it's Africa?
When this is my room, they don't come within 20 feet of the door.
Oh, I can't believe she's here.
I can't believe my sister picked now to have a fight with her.
- I can't believe - I'm going to have - To move into - the boys' room.
Calm down.
Does your sister know your mom is dying?
- What are you - talking about?
Does your sister know your mother has a fatal disease that she's been hiding - and this might be - her last chance To make peace?
With her mother.
Who's dying.
Wipe.
Cream.
Ready.
- Done!
-  - Yeah!
Number one.
In your face!
We're just learning - how to take care - of our babies.
That's loser talk.
We're gonna be the best big brothers ever.
We aced Diaper and we totally owned Tub Time.
I'm so glad I memorized - all the common - household chemicals - That can be poisonous - to the baby.
You know, all this stuff parents have to do all the feedings and bathings and diaperings and safety stuff and scheduling Just made me realize.
Mom never did any of this.
There's a bottle of this on our headboard.
No wonder we turned out the way we did.
- It's six months, - maybe a year.
- I'm gonna need - that computer.
- Not today, squirt.
- Lois is about to have a baby, And I'm in charge of research.
She's hot.
I can't work with someone looking over my shoulder.
- Well, I'll see - if I can find her.
Mother!
Telephone!
Is the border station going to return my rifle?
Hello?
Yes?
- Oh, I'm glad - to hear you say that.
No, I'm fine.
I'm here with you-know-who, and she's doing you-know-what.
Again.
Yeah.
Where are the paramedics?
- These contractions - are too close to time.
Francis, this baby's going to be born any minute.
- I want you to do - something for me.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to deliver the baby.
What?
No.
You can do it.
- You've done it - before.
You deliver barn animals all the time.
- You're not a - barn animal.
Francis, your father isn't here; you're the only person I trust.
You don't even like me.
But I love you, which is why - you're going - to do this.
No!
You can't make me!
- Francis, your mother - is asking for your help.
-  - Francis.
You can do this.
You know that you can.
Now, you're going to put your hands inside of Mommy and take out this baby!
Lois.
Oh, Lois.
I finally found you.
Oh, I missed the baby.
It's okay.
The baby is fine, Hal.
Honey, I'm the worst husband in the world.
I can't believe how terrible I am.
Oh I can't believe I made you go through this alone.
I wish I could have been there.
You were there, Hal.
I was?
We're a part of each other.
Wherever I go, you're there.
You are always with me.
I love you.
Oh, my God, what is that man doing?
What?
Get that sicko off of her.
What?
Lois?
Are you?
Someone call the police.
-  - Dad!
Oh, my God!
- What the hell - are you doing?
Can you see the head?
Not yet.
You're not even looking.
- Is it starting - to crown?
Uh yes.
That's good.
That's good.
God, I can't believe I'm looking at this.
I'm going to die.
If the head is completely crowning, it's okay to push.
If anyone calls, I'll be at your sister's.
No, don't worry.
I'll let myself out.
Come on, Lois.
Come on.
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
-  - Was that the?
I got it.
I got it.
Oh, my God.
I got it!
Yes!
It's here.
Put it on her chest.
Oh.
Hi, baby.
Hi.
Hi, baby.
Oh, thank you, Francis.
This is the nicest thing you've ever done for me.
I am so proud of you.
You can go vomit now.
-  - Way to go.
- Here he comes.
- There he is.
Well, is it a boy or a girl?
- It's a beautiful, - healthy baby   Aw I knew it!
Oh, that's all right.
Hi there.
I'm your mommy.
Okay, so who's having the baby?
I told you we shouldn't have stopped for coffee.
- Oh, I've forgotten - how small they are.
I forgot how good they smell.
-  - Yeah.
Okay, hand it over.
-  - It's 5:30.
- It's time for the baby's - sponge bath.
- Look how full - this diaper is.
When was the last time you changed it?
- Have you at least come up - with a name yet?
Yes.
Jamie.
It fits.
We'll come back when your udders are ready.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Oh, not again.
This baby is gonna kill us.
-  - Oh, Jamie, for the love of!
It's all over the walls.
Boys, it's a level three!
Backyard, now!
- : - Oh, my God!
- How does this kid - keep getting out - Of its diaper?
Damned if I know.
- I put that one on - with duct tape.
- Reese, get a mask and bucket - and clean up that wall.
Malcolm, find the old diaper - and bury it - at least three feet deep.
Dewey, stand by with the garden hose.
- Oh, we don't - have any diapers!
How did we go through a bonus pack in one day?
- Ugh!
Jamie just went - all over the towel!
Dewey, here.
give me your pajama top.
Not again!
This is my last pair!
Let's get you to the shower.
God oh  Oh, no, no, no, wait, wait.
Ugh, it's in my hair!
Life is unfair.
- Yes, I was checking our status - at the day care center.
What?
How do you move down on the waiting list?
- Those are juvenile - offenses And shouldn't be part of the public record!
Hal, what are we going to do?
My maternity leave is over, I go back to work tomorrow, and we still haven't found day care for Jamie.
Well, honey, maybe you'll have to just - stay out - a little longer.
- I know money - is tight, but We can always stretch our pennies a little more.
This is insane.
There is no juice left in there.
You are watering down water.
- All right, - we're desperate!
- But there has to be - some decent day care program We can afford.
Now, where the hell haven't we looked?
We're joining a church?
- We don't know anything - about these people.
- They have the best staffed - co-op nursery in town, - And they'll take care - of Jamie for free.
So, as far as these people know, we've been practicing members of the Brethren of Calvary for years, you understand?
- Why doesn't Malcolm - have to be here?
Would you rather be doing his job right now?
Ow, ow, ow!
Let go, let go!
- What if they - ask me to pray?
- I don't know - how to pray.
- Look, they only - want to meet us.
- So for the next half hour, - as far as you're concerned, - God is the greatest - thing in the universe, And that's that.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Pastor Roy.
- I understand you - want to transfer Your membership from the Brethren in Danville?
Yes.
We were longtime members in Danville.
- I didn't know we had a church - in Danville.
It's gone now, bought out by a strip club.
Really?
- Well, it's not - all nude.
It's just topless with tassels, but still We just so want to continue - to be part - of the Brethren community.
"Community".
I love that word.
And our branch is very active.
I'm sure the boys will enjoy Bible study.
Oh, I'm sure they will.
And of course, - we also have hayrides, retreats, - prayer breakfasts - Day care?
- Day care - Really?
Lois, - did you hear that?
They have day care.
I did not know that.
That kind of service is why we have always - been so committed - to this church.
That's wonderful.
- Have you gone through - the Precepts of the Covenant?
Yes.
Of course.
Love the Precepts.
Number three has gotten me through some hard times.
But it always comes back to God, huh?
Yeah, God's pretty neat.
Yeah, he's totally my favorite of all them.
I promise I will hire you back just as soon as business picks up.
I've never seen it this slow, Otto.
That makes six employees laid off in one week.
It is that festival down at Roswell.
All of the tourists are going To see where the UFOs landed.
Our people are losing their jobs - 'cause a bunch of idiot tourists - think little green men Crashed a spaceship down there?
- That's ridiculous.
- Ja.
- They will see - nothing down there.
The government put every scrap of evidence in a secret vault Is this the news desk?
- Listen, I'm out - at the Grotto Ranch, And oh, my God, there it is again!
There's something weird happening in the sky!
- I see a light - and some kind of craft.
You'd better get out here right away!
I suppose it could be out here for another 20 minutes, but you'd better hurry!
Hi, Donna, we're here.
Oh, hi, Lois.
This must be your little angel.
-  - There, there.
I don't know what got into Jamie this morning.
This is so out of the ordinary!
There, there, pumpkin.
When'd you get so fussy?
- Well, sometimes - even the youngest babies - Can sense your anxiety - on the first day.
Yeah, that must be it.
Uh, I expressed some breast milk.
Oh, my.
- I come from a long - line of milkers.
- Once these get started, - there's no stopping them.
Whoa, this is so unusual!
- At home we forget - we even have a baby.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
We're going to get along great here, aren't we, precious?
Now, I know a lot of the mothers like to hang around for a while on the first day, but we think it's - I'm still waiting for a price - Here's your change.
- Thank you.
That's not the right ointment!
What's wrong with you?
!
- You said you wanted - the do-it-yourself - Applicator, You crazy old man!
- You think you're getting - out of helping me with this?
!
You're my wife!
Ooh.
Ooh!
Has it always been this quiet here?
And the best part is, when you play with God, it's always your turn.
What does the "T" on the wall stand for?
Uh, we'll talk about that later.
Hal, I have to meet a parishioner in my office.
- Would you mind - continuing the lesson?
- What, me?
- Don't worry.
It's just the story of Daniel and the lions.
I'm sure you know it in your sleep.
Uh Okay, then, class.
- : - Uh This is a story about a man named Daniel, and, apparently, some lions, so Um "Uh, it-it pleased Darius "to set over the kingdom "120 princes, "which should be over the whole kingdom, "and over these three officials, uh, uh, of whom Daniel was first" When do the lions show up?
Soon, Dewey.
- Please, you just have to be - a little patient.
Ooh!
Ooh!
"Uh, uh, and Darius said to Daniel, "'Yea, verily, I smote you, - "and I send thee - to be thrown into the den.
' "Where soon, Daniel was eaten by the lions".
I thought God saved him.
Oh.
Well, sure.
- I was getting - to that.
Uh, as, as it is written the lion dith spit him up along with a lamb.
A talking lamb.
- : - "And verily, "it came to pass "that the big lump in the middle of the boa constrictor "turned out to be "the missing ranger.
"Forasmuch as the multitudes could still hear his radio "saying unto them, : "Come in, Dave.
Dave, do you read me"?
No need to go up to Lover's Lane And come back down All full of shame I'll smile as I sing the same refrain Abstain, abstain, abstain!
- Oh!
-  Well, we really shook the rafters, didn't we?
I think Pastor Roy might call the cops on us.
Yes, Reese?
Is there some kind of loyalty oath I can sign so I can get out of here?
- Reese, no one's - forcing you to stay.
- The only thing - keeping you here Is that little voice in your head that keeps saying, "Why are all these people so much happier than me"?
Now, then, as you know, - Mrs. Pitzer, - the church secretary, - Suffered a paralyzing - spider bite At last summer's faith retreat, - but out of - that tragedy Has come these wonderful inspirational scenes that she paints with her mouth.
Here's Elijah being taken up to Heaven in his fiery chariot; Jonah and the whale; the parting of the Red Sea It's a joyful thing to witness the way God has blessed this woman's tongue and teeth.
I don't need no evil weed Oh, man.
Wow.
Keep your crack and your LSD I'm snorting something That God gave me And it smells a lot like love Mom, I don't want to go to that class.
You see this paycheck?
- I earned this because - we have day care.
Those who earn paychecks get to have an opinion.
- Those who don't - go to Bible school.
Hal, three serious diapers on the way home.
We have to burn the car seat.
Dad, talk to her.
- I don't want to go - to this class.
Malcolm, you have to give this church a chance.
- I understand it's - a little different - From what we're - used to, - But I opened up - to the experience, And I feel a real spiritual connection.
- How's it looking, Hal?
- Great.
- See you got the - windows framed in.
We all find our own path our own way.
- I don't like the way - it feels either, - But I don't have any more - blouses, you little miracle.
If you could just, for the love of God, stop crying.
Hi, Donna.
Oh, don't tell me Jamie's been carrying on again.
You sure have a high-spirited little one.
Yeah, I guess I do.
Thanks for everything.
All right, dear.
- Oh, and are you going - to be picking up Seth, Or should he be dropped off?
Seth?
Who's Seth?
- You're babysitting - Seth Richards.
- It's been on the schedule - for two weeks.
See?
Saturday, Lois has Seth.
You don't understand.
- I'm one of those people who - drops kids off at the co-op.
I don't watch them.
I work.
We all take turns sitting.
That's what "co-op" means.
But I thought this one of those churches where, you know, people felt good doing things for other people - who don't have - to do anything back.
I have to work tomorrow.
I'm sorry, but you're going to have to figure out something else.
Seth, you have got to get out of there!
This is my fort!
I'll be with you in a minute.
- I have to admit, - I was a doubter.
- But I guess - we're pretty lucky - To get a visit - from an actual UFO.
Yeah, yeah, but look at me.
I am still shaking from seeing that craft with my own two eyes.
I tell you, they spoke to me telepathically.
-  - There's been - Another sighting!
- The alien's moved down - to the Songbird Ranch.
They actually have a piece of landing gear.
What?
No, they don't.
They're lying.
- Otto, we can't - let these people For your own safety, do not wave at them.
They think our hands are sex organs.
You may start something you won't want to finish.
What?
I love you.
Stop saying that.
- Ever since we joined - this church, - You've been acting - really weird.
- That's because - I'm a different Reese.
I was sitting in Bible class dead, when suddenly I was awakened.
I'm dedicated to something outside myself now.
Something wonderful.
Now come here.
Can't you just hit me like you used to?
I'm just too happy.
It's beautiful.
You painted it and everything.
Welcome home, Hal.
I am so overwhelmed by this.
And I'm not just blowing smoke this time.
You are the best.
God bless you all.
I think you're charging me for your own soda.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That kid has me so frazzled.
I mean Where is he?
Lois, for the love of God, - are you watching - this kid or not?
Where did you find him?
Under a car - sharing his candy bar - with a squirrel.
He didn't like it.
He's sick.
Lois, I am trying out - a less supportive - undergarment.
I can't be chasing this boy all around the store.
- Why don't you just - leave him in your car Like the other bad mothers do?
Mrs. Munson, I want you to release my brother.
What?
Ever since Reese got in your class, he's been really nice to me.
Trust me it's creepy.
- I don't like - this church.
Ever since we came here, all I do is think about stuff.
What kind of God makes children think when they're not even in school?
Well, now, see, that is a torment, but I'm sure He has His reasons.
Yeah, like Pastor Roy said.
- How God's so much bigger - and wiser than us - And trying to see - what he's thinking Would be like an ant trying to see what I'm thinking.
Yes, exactly.
But we can trust in His wisdom and we can have faith that He is watching over us.
Like me with the anthill in my backyard.
- I spent days watching the ants, - trying to figure out Which ones were good and which ones were bad.
But they all just looked like ants, - so I started - smiting all of them.
Well, that's not - I was smiting them - with the garden hose - And with lighter fluid - and with the lawn mower, - And to be - perfectly honest, I think I went a little crazy with the shovel.
Those ants - could have been praying - to me all day, I wouldn't have heard them.
There was nothing they could do about it.
- But I don't - think Really, it's the same with us.
There's nothing we can do about anything, either.
So why worry about it?
Hey, this is making me feel better.
Well, that's good, but - I guess all we can do - is live our lives - With as much - kindness And decency as possible and try not to dwell on God standing over us with that giant shovel.
Bye.
That was $50 worth of makeup.
Am I pretty?
No, you are not pretty.
- You have caused me an - enormous amount of trouble - And I have had it, - you hear me?
Seth?
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
Is he Are you from the co-op?
Yes, yes, I am.
- And I suppose that - this might look a little odd, - But in my defense, - I didn't realize - I'd have to take care - of a kid today - A child - a, um A little person.
What are pleasure dots?
Oh, my Lord.
Seth, you come away from that woman this instant.
He did some nice coloring.
- What the hell - are you doing?
- What does it look - like I'm doing?
What kind of alien are you?
- You don't even glow - in the dark.
Get out of here.
- You get out of here.
- You get out of here.
You get out of here.
You get Hal, I had a terrible day with that child.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry I couldn't help you out.
- I just got back - from an all-day Hayride committee meeting.
Do you know there are six different kinds of hay - and they all have - their promoters.
Hal, listen to me.
It was impossible at work with that child, but I kept thinking, "I don't have a choice.
I have to do this for Jamie".
- And then the parents came - and there was - This ugly thing, - and then I saw this.
Hey, this is good coloring.
- It's baby Moses - in the bullrushes.
And I started to think about that story, - where the mother has - to take her little one - And send him - down the river forever To be raised by someone else.
And I wanted to be that mom.
Hal I don't like this baby.
Are you serious?
I know it's terrible.
- I don't deserve - to be a mother.
- I'm supposed to be - feeling all this perfect Motherly love, and it's not there.
It is just not there.
- I can't believe - you're saying this.
I know it's horrible.
You really don't remember, do you?
Remember what?
Honey, you've hated all our babies.
- You couldn't - stand The sight of any of them for at least two months.
- What?
- Well, Reese, six months, - But he was a nipple-biter, - so I didn't blame you.
You told me - to leave Francis - at the county fair - So he could be - raised by cows.
Oh, my God.
It's just that you're so tired and, I mean, this all seems so overwhelming, but believe me, in a few weeks you are going to love this baby as much as anyone has ever loved a baby.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey, I don't hear anything.
Where is the baby?
Sleeping quietly.
Been that way for an hour.
Oh, my goodness.
How precious.
Who couldn't love something like that?
Do we have to keep the painting?
No.
We just have to find an atheist handyman.
Come, it's time.
It all became clear to me that first day in church.
- And now that - everything Has been carefully prepared, this will be the most magnificent day of my life.
What are you doing?
- I plan to float - above the clouds And experience the joy that only birds can know.
You're going to fry yourself on a high-voltage wire.
I'm not afraid.
I have faith in my vision.
I love you, Dewey.
This is incredible.
- I can see the top of Dad's car - from here.
I'll miss you at first.
No, I'm as surprised as you are.
No, I'm as surprised as you are.
No, I'm as surprised as you are.
Amazing race How sweet the taste That saved a wrench for me I once was in the lost and found Was blind, but found my keys.
My face - The United States - government is not happy With the level of interest you've created in this sector.
But what's the harm in pretending I'm from another planet?
- I mean, all - that UFO stuff - About abductions - and cavity probes, That's all made up.
Right?
Yes, there are no aliens.
But there are cavity probes.
But you just joined us two weeks ago.
Believe me, you do not want us to be part of your church.
We really don't belong around civilized people.
- Oh, come now.
- I'm sure that's just a   See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're talking about.
