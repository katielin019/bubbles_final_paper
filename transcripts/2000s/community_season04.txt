{START OF EPISODE 1}
Troy and Abed back from summer Wait a minute.
Something's changed.
There's 12 additional thumbtacks on that board.
They're driving me crazy.
No, I meant this.
Trying out the hipster look.
It's cool, but also not.
Hey, guys, have a good summer?
Take them off.
Happy first day of school.
Oh.
Good morning.
I brought brownies.
Oh.
Congratulations, it's me.
Huh.
I see we've all reinvented ourselves over the summer.
A little late to the hipster party much?
A little much on the "much" much?
We should get to class.
Where's Pierce?
I don't know.
Hey-o.
Sorry, I'm late.
Damn Mexican cleaning woman did a cha-cha on my glasses so I gotta wear this old pair.
Abed.
Abed.
Abed.
Yeah?
Did you go to your happy place?
Yeah.
Did you envision a babbling brook like I described?
I started with a babbling brook, then layered in elements from our world.
I'm sure fans of the brook will complain, but it was limiting.
Keep it simple.
It was a babbling brook.
Okay.
Here's the deal, Jessica Biel.
The first day of senior year is emotional for everyone so I hereby therapize you to go to your happy place whenever you feel stressed.
I found my lucky notebook.
Found my lucky charm.
Abed, you ready for our last first day of school?
Are you ready, buddy?
I just need a minute.
This is my show It's about me And all my friends on Abed TV My happy place Nothing but fun Nothing but laughs and smiles And then we rerun For those times When life's too hard to face I'll find some happy In my happy place Abed's Happy Community College Show is filmed before a live audience inside of my head.
I can't believe we're getting into this class.
I can't believe there's a History of Ice Cream.
Seniors.
Ha-ha-ha.
Hey.
There they are.
I missed you guys.
Oh.
Seniors.
Oh!
Speaking of seniors, I've decided I'm gonna do senioritis this year.
You know, just hanging out and blowing off classes, pullin' pranks, not saying my G's.
Ooh.
I'll pull some pranks with you.
Okay.
Or Jeff or whoever.
You know, whoever's around, whatever.
Abed, we're still doing our first-day-of-school tradition?
You know it.
We make wishes in the fountain.
Aww.
Fellas, I hate to tell you, wishes aren't real.
If you want something bad, you have to work for it.
Or use a spell.
All of our wishes come true.
Last year, Troy wished we got Bin Laden and the Dorito taco.
But Obama got credit for both.
Could you wish for Jeff to be on time?
No.
No wasting wishes on impossibilities.
We have to make this year count, especially since it's the last one.
Oh, no.
Is all this for The History of Ice Cream?
Overbooked.
It's first come, first serve now.
Just like real ice cream.
Guys, over here.
Oh, Jeffrey.
Jeff.
Jeff, I can't believe that you came early.
Don't you read Garrett's Twitter?
He posted a crisis alert about it.
I came early to save seats.
Oh, you know what, girls?
I gave you the old flyer.
Instagram for Besties is in Room 44.
Showing up early, helping others, sending girls away?
Could this be a whole new Jeff Winger?
Don't ruin it by approving it.
Oh, so that's progressed.
I mean, it's progressed, but it hasn't "progressed" progressed.
It's progressive.
Good luck, Troy.
Hey.
You can't just walk in here.
I've been pissing in jars for an hour trying to keep this seat.
Leonard, keep those-- Yes.
All right, all right, all right.
Simmer dean.
This can't be good.
He's dressed as himself.
Greendale's registration system has been hacked.
That's right.
Someone hacked into the supply closet and counterfeited these History of Ice Cream admission cards.
Whoever did this is very good.
There is only one fair way to solve this.
So follow me to The Hunger Deans.
Ha-ha-ha.
Thank you.
Thank you.
There are 35 tests of strength and agility.
The winner of each one of these contests will be awarded a red rubber ball.
No ball, no ice cream.
And these are impossible to counterfeit because each one has been marked by my distinct bite print.
Oh, Lord, no.
Yeah.
We need to take this class.
It's the only history credit this semester.
Whatevs.
We'll take it next semes.
Ter.
Semester.
But I need it now.
Okay.
I took some extra classes online and I'm one history credit away from graduating.
Jeff, you're graduating early?
Well, graduating after 30 can't be characterized as early.
When were you gonna tell us?
I was working on a speech.
Believe me, it tied in a lot of things.
There was a lot of resolutions and epiphanies.
It would have gone down a lot better after we had taken the ice cream class together.
That's why you held our seats, your own selfish reasons.
No, I want us to take the class together.
I just want it to be the last class we take together.
I should've phrased that differently.
Win your ball.
What do I care?
I've got a senior prank to pull.
Shirley.
Mm-hm.
Abed, ready to make some wishes?
Make chocolate hot dogs a reality?
Go with Britta.
I'll just hang out here and watch.
Really?
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm fine.
F- I-N-E or F-Y-N-E?
We made one of them a code for "not fine".
F- Y-N-E.
Okay, he's fine.
Let's go.
See you around, old Jeff.
No, new Jeff.
New Jeff does not just look out for himself.
New Jeff is gonna win seven red balls.
Because he is not gonna take that class unless you guys are with me.
Look, we're gonna have to leave this place sometime.
Like an ice cream cone melting in the sun, our time here can't last forever.
That was part of the speech I was writing.
Hey, guys.
What's going on?
Just making plans for the future.
Can't stay at Greendale forever.
Hey, is mine different than yours?
Look out below.
Coming in for a Ian-dean.
Amelia Earhart?
Close.
I am America's sexiest aviator, Leo DiCaprio.
And just as his character lost his mind so have I lost your student records.
What?
I can't believe it.
Yeah, Amelia Earhart would have been faster.
As you know, our student records are stored on a Microsoft Paint file, which I was assured was future-proof.
Meanwhile, our extended warranty is not being honored by the restaurant that used to be Circuit City.
But I think the fairest way to handle this is to have everyone repeat the last three years.
You can't be serious.
In-dean, I am.
We're gonna be here forever.
Forever.
I'm gonna stay in here forever.
Gentlemen and ladies.
My first red ball is way up high.
To touch my ball, first touch the sky.
Go.
Give it up, Leonard.
I'm gonna eat your ice cream, Winger.
Ugh!
You?
You're premed.
I want ice cream.
Yeah, well, I wanna graduate with dignity.
Come over.
Jeff's really going after that ball.
There's gotta be a joke in there somewhere.
That's my first ball.
New Jeff.
Give me a minute.
Give me a minute.
This one!
This one!
Whew.
Ha-ha-ha.
No.
If we're doing the first three years over again, I could change majors.
I've always been curious about forensics.
Did you know you could major in antics?
You need a tomfoolery prereq.
They waive it for women.
This is lunacy.
We are not gonna start over as freshmen.
Hey, there's a freshman mixer tonight.
Are you guys freshmen?
We can be.
This prank is amazing.
He's gonna come in here later and have the creepy feeling someone was in here.
We should go before we get caught.
Aren't we gonna do something?
Do something?
Mm-mm-mm.
All right.
A prank on a prank.
Let's move everything on his desk over an inch except his stapler.
Then he'll think we moved his stapler.
There's so many levels to this.
How about we fill his car with popcorn?
That sounds messy.
That sounds messy.
Okay.
Keys.
Keys- Okay, I'm the dean.
I come into my office, turn on the light.
"Oh, my, did my stapler grow legs and move"?
Then come over here for coffee.
I would hide my keys in Huh.
Hm.
Oh.
Heels.
Hmm.
You got skills.
Oh.
Look who got his ball.
Not my ball, your ball.
I wanted you guys to see it.
New Jeff.
Is that blood on your shirt?
Oh, no, it's cool.
It's Leonard's.
Oh.
Oh.
Two balls.
Ha-ha-ha.
This is gonna be so good when I finally get it.
It's a little weird doing this without Abed.
Come on, it'll be fun.
I'll put my Britta twist on it.
I got skills.
I got skills.
Sorry.
Let's get this started.
We always do the first one together.
One, two, three.
A great school year.
A thousand wishes.
Great school year?
First wish is always for 1000 wishes.
But we have all these coins.
Yeah, but the coins aren't the wishes.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I wish for Britta to have 499 of my remaining wishes.
Thank you.
I wish to end all wars.
That's another rule.
No wishes containing the word "all".
Guaranteed ironic consequences.
I don't think anyone's gonna miss wars.
Uh, Star Wars, thumb wars.
Wow, Storage Wars.
Fine.
You can't get in.
I'm taking that penny back.
The pennies aren't wishes.
You can't flip a wish.
That's ridiculous.
Your rules are ridiculous.
They're Abed's rules.
They're awesome.
They always work.
Well, Abed's not here so unwish.
You can't do that.
I just did.
Unwish.
No.
Rewish.
Unwish.
Un-unwish.
Give me!
Unwish!
No!
Uhn!
No!
Oh, I'm sorry.
What-- ?
You're helping me!
You're helping.
I like it.
Unwish!
Unwish!
Why does this feel good?
Stupid, selfish Jeff coming here ruining our senior year.
Uh!
Great, my G's are back.
It's crummy Jeff is leaving early, but we're all graduating eventually.
But why the rush?
What, so Jeff can run off and be a gross lawyer again?
Troy and Abed start drinking coffee?
I become a boring hospital administrator?
Who wants to do that?
You do.
Right?
Yay.
Hospital administration.
Can't wait to be buried alive under a pile of paperwork and bedpans, trying to summon the courage to ask out Dr. Patel, the gorgeous neurosurgeon who doesn't know I exist.
This isn't a conversation, is it?
Whoo-hoo.
The sad, slow march toward death begins.
Senioritis.
Ready, set Third ball.
Fourth ball.
Well, well, well.
Looks like someone wants to be a hero.
A big man.
A huge, throbbing, sweaty-- I wanna get my history credit and get out of here.
And I just need to know how bad you want it.
Next competition will be particularly difficult for some of you because it requires complete emotional commitment.
The tango.
I will be the judge.
There can only be one winner so choose your partners wisely.
Come on, Winger.
Water under the bridge, right?
Partners?
Sorry, my dance card's full.
For my partner in the tango competition, I choose the dean.
The fountain works.
All these balls.
I'm so close, I can taste it.
Pierce, only you could turn a freshman mixer into a disaster!
I was this close to getting those two girls.
Look how close you're holding your fingers together.
That's your penis.
Guys, great news.
After just one forensics class, I found a way to retrieve our student records.
It turns out there's a backup, and it's in this safe.
Oh.
I have a theory, dean.
Do tell.
I don't think you want me to graduate.
Don't be absurd, Jeffrey.
I want success for all Greendale students.
Oh, really?
Then answer me this.
What happened to the other history class?
What other history class?
The second history class, the one that actually taught history that disappeared from the schedule after I took summer classes.
You're telling yourself a fantasy.
Who really made those counterfeited ice cream tickets?
Who's so good that they got your handwriting with its hearts and flourishes?
Oh, God, you're right.
I can't let you go, Jeffrey.
You weren't supposed to compete.
You were supposed to walk away with the group.
You can't not get rid of me that easily.
Oh, God.
Why'd I make it feats of strength and grace?
It's It's as if I wanted you to win.
But that can't be true.
Smile.
Best friends.
So let's hug it out.
Okay.
Here.
One more ball to go.
But it's another dance contest, so I think I got it.
What's wrong with Abed?
Don't.
We're redoing our first three years.
That's what I want.
It's okay, Abed.
Here's a trick I use when I feel overwhelmed.
Just imagine a happy place and then go there.
Greendale Babies They're happy and they're free Greendale Babies Fun for you and me Greendale Babies forever Greendale Babies will be right back.
Forever.
Greendale Babies Pierce, what did you do to Abed?
Gay balls.
Nailed it.
Don't ask.
Don't tell.
Poor Abed.
Is he in his imagination emporium?
Dreamatorium?
No, this seems like something new.
Abed was having some anxiety about all the changes this year so I may have told him to go to a happy place in his mind.
You told him to go somewhere in his mind?
Do you realize who you told that to?
The last competition to win a red ball begins in one minute.
Honestly, Jeff, you can go.
No one will think you're selfish.
This looks bad.
I wish I hadn't broken Abed.
There is one thing we could try.
Oh, okay.
Hey, let's play pretend.
Yeah, we could be cowboys.
We could be spacemen.
That's right, baby Pierce.
We can play forever.
It's not working.
What's not working?
Okay, contestants, final competition begins right now.
God, I hate new Jeff.
Hey, guys, I have something to say.
Yay!
Like always.
I was just outside Babyville.
There's nothing outside Babyville.
You know what?
There is.
And it was scary, because change is always scary.
But then I thought of you guys, and I wasn't so scared.
Abed, when you brought this group together, you changed our lives.
But then we changed each other.
And we're gonna keep changing in unexpected ways.
We'll still be friends even if we don't all become professors at Greendale, open a restaurant, or move into the same apartment building after Pierce dies.
And even if we go somewhere, we're not going anywhere.
Aww That was a killer speech, Jeff.
I didn't say anything.
I literally just walked up.
I made the speech for you.
It hit all the right notes.
I was trying to hang on to this moment because I was afraid of the future.
But then I realized all of this was once the future.
It was different from what I'd known before, and it was happening so fast.
But in the end, or in the now, I guess, it turned out great.
And just like ice cream, we've melted together and made a new-- I just had to run the scenario to figure it out.
Sorry I missed the fountain.
It's okay.
Britta introduced a new rule: No rules.
We can discuss it.
When they were incepting, I got their balls.
Hey.
Over there.
Get out of the way.
Now that we're out of History of Ice Cream, I can finally take Advanced Claims Denial.
You should take forensics.
Hmm.
Can somebody tell me what the hell we just did?
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey, wait.
What are you-- ?
Oh.
You smell like the floor of a movie theater.
Yeah, but not for the usual reasons.
I have had the worst day.
Our dance photo didn't come out, someone moved my stapler, and, worst of all, I hurt you.
You'll be happy to know that we'll be offering another history class because I care about you.
Not because I found out if we don't offer a real history class, we'll lose $40,000 in grant money.
Thank you, dean.
You didn't have to come all this way to tell me that.
Oh, no, it wasn't a problem.
It's on my way.
Tell me you're breaking into that condo.
No, I bought it.
Now we'll be like almost roomies.
Oh, good, you got wine.
I've got Friends With Benefits.
Heh.
No subtext.
I don't know why I was so worried about change.
This year's gonna be great.
I'll be right over.
"Hello.
My name is Kevin.
I have Changnesia".
Sure this will work?
Guaranteed to.
It's an antic.
Ah.
Not so fast, you two.
Get ready to run.
In these heels?
Where'd you girls get those dresses?
They're fabulous.
Mm.
They're charming.
Oh.
Uh-uh.
Not so fast, mister.
Excuse you?
Excuse me.
Thank you, sir.
Not for you.
Hello, it's Britta.
Okay, I know a man when I see one.
Oh, Lord, no
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
And Andre is going as Han Solo.
Aww.
The boys are Stormtroopers and little baby Ben is an Ewok.
- Aww.
- Aww.
Aw.
You don't have enough children.
Happy Halloween parties.
You all look great.
Ham.
Pig.
Let me guess.
You're a flimsy excuse to be shirtless, wearing silk underwear.
And you're as wrong as you are welcome.
No, this year I planned a two-person costume with Annie.
She's going as my ring girl.
Pretty freaky-deaky, huh?
Annie, no.
The boxing match ring girl.
The sexy ones that hold the round numbers.
Yeah, see, this is why we can't just text about it, Jeff.
I don't watch sports.
There's no boxer in The Ring.
I don't watch scary movies.
"And that's why we leave the couples' costumes to the couples" she said wisely.
Warn your boyfriend's boyfriend.
We're dating.
Doesn't mean we do everything together.
You need to do some things together.
We do some things.
We do a lot of things.
Not all the things.
Things.
Okay, we're all here, minus Pierce, who wasn't invited to Vicki's party For reasons beyond our control or concern.
No mystery there.
She put a pencil through his face.
Does Vicki have a TV?
It's a party.
No watching TV.
I watch Annie.
She watches Cougar Town reruns.
Makes Annie my third-favorite show.
And tonight is their Hallo-wine special.
That's right.
Better not miss the merlot.
Clink.
What?
You fall into it.
That was Pierce.
He locked himself in his panic room.
He needs our help.
No "oh".
"Oh" means we are going against our will, and we are not going.
He's lying.
He seemed upset.
He's been alone up there in that mansion ever since I moved out and his dad, you know, got killed by Jeff.
Calling for help.
A classic call for help.
"Hello, Dr. Perry's office.
Damaged psyche?
Yes, I'll accept the charges".
Heads, lock up your brains.
Britta's on the prowl for therapy meat.
Maybe we should just stop by on our way to the party.
I assure you, the only thing Pierce is trapped in is adolescence.
He's a geriatric toddler throwing the most elaborate tantrums money can buy.
And I for one am not gonna stand by and allow some lonely ridiculous person to derail our group's plans.
Dean, dean, dean!
To your corners, fighters.
Someone save me a towel.
You guys going to Vicki's party?
We just gotta do this thing first.
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said It can be here We could be roped up, tied up Dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one They all just fade away Holy Helen, this place is huge.
Seems spookier than I remember.
The only thing spooky about this place is the tacky decor.
It's like David Lee Roth threw up Miami Vice.
Ugh.
So tacky.
Maybe Pierce isn't doing so well since he lost his father and then his inheritance in a video game battle with Gilbert an illegitimate half-brother he never knew he had.
I guess I've never said it out loud.
Guys, over here.
Havvthorne's panic room, one of the 27 stops on the tour I had to memorize before moving into Hawthorne Manor.
Does the house get visitors?
You're the first.
Impenetrable titanium carbonite door, hacker-proof key-code access panel impressive video telecom screen with remote.
Maximum occupancy one, with female companion.
Purchased June 30th, 1989.
It took me forever to remember that.
June 30th, 1989.
Theatrical release of Do the Right Thing.
Oh!
Oh.
Wait, it might be a trap.
Or it might let him out.
Either way, we-- Oh, put a sock in it, shorts.
Oh, hey, guys.
Pierce, are you okay?
Oh, sure, fine, fine.
I was dusting in here and I must have bumped a switch or something.
As the graceful one in the group, I'm kind of embarrassed.
Don't be.
I've been locked in way worse places than this.
Oh, not against my will.
Been in there long?
No, not long, but I couldn't remember the damn code.
Sorry to be a burden on you guys, but I guess that's all I am now.
Aww.
It's okay.
We're happy to help.
No sweat, Boba Fett.
Yeah.
Do you have a TV?
What Abed means is did you write the code down anywhere?
Yes, it's in a red notebook in my study or my bedroom, maybe.
I used to know where everything was before I fired my maid.
Now there's no reason to use my safe.
We'll find it.
It'll take two secs.
Or we take one sec and just skip to the catch.
This place hasn't been dusted in months.
He starts with the panic room?
No sale.
He's not a sad old man.
He's a sad old liar.
Jeffrey!
No, no, he's right.
I've been lying to you.
The truth is, last night, I got up to get a glass of red wi-- Water, and on my way back from the cellar I saw something that scared me so badly I locked myself in here on purpose.
The part about not remembering the code is true.
I'm very thirsty.
Why didn't you call me sooner?
I had to come up with that awesome dusting story because if you knew what spooked me you'd probably call me crazy and old.
No one's gonna call you, Pierce.
You can tell us.
We're here to help you.
I thought I saw my dad.
Ohh.
Looked like his face was coming right through the wall.
But that's impossible, because my dad is dead.
Aha!
I mean, not "Aha, your dad is dead," but "Aha, I knew it".
Ghost dad, exploring your haunted mansion for secret codes?
Nice try, Pierce.
You gotta be kidding me.
What in the Scooby-Doo is happening to you people?
Go to the party.
We'll meet you there.
We're gonna stay and help Pierce.
He doesn't need help.
He needs attention.
Are you really this naive?
Am I naive?
I'm sure as stuff not your sexy little ring girl.
- I-- - Can it, ham.
She's also my ride.
Troy said-- Pierce's bedroom is the third door.
I didn't leave my short-term memory at Coachella.
Jeez, Winger, keep it above the belt.
I'm sorry.
Already forgotten.
This house is getting to me.
Kind of weird that a dead person used to live here.
What's weird is that a living person lived here with his parents well into his 60s then they died and he's still here like a paralyzed Peter Pan.
Not for long.
I'm gonna set my shrink ray to "daddy issues" and blast that sucker full of closure.
I guess it can't hurt.
Exactly.
Because in one way or another, therapy is always helpful.
No, because there's no possible way you could mess him up worse.
It's like practicing on a cadaver.
Knock yourself out.
This has gotta be it.
Ugh.
Wish I didn't have so much exposed skin.
Tubular.
I, too, lack the adjectives.
How does one search for a red notebook that doesn't exist without looking, touching or creating nightmares?
I'll check the nightstand.
I'll check my messages.
Oh, my God.
Pierce keeps his dad's bow tie by his bed.
Yeesh.
Table for Siggy Freud, party of-- Britta, stop answering phones.
How about we ask Rip van Racism where the codes are?
Don't.
That's not nice.
What?
He was a tightfisted, philandering bigot who got to outlive most bridges.
We don't owe him reverence.
How about it, you old bag of dust?
You got our numbers?
I'm serious, stop it.
You don't really believe in ghosts?
I'm just not so quick to rule it out.
I believe people can be haunted by unresolved issues in their past.
Issues don't turn into ghosts.
Maybe for Pierce, they have.
Maybe Pierce and his dad have seriously unfinished business.
No, the dead can't have business.
They can't want or think or do.
It's what makes them dead.
It's the living who choose to be haunted.
Cornelius was barely a dad.
Now he's nothing.
Pierce can keep staring into that void or he can turn around, face his future like I did, and say: "Who gives a crap who my dad was?
I'm my own man now".
Wow, pretty slick, Britta.
Using ghosts to trick me into opening up.
Too bad it didn't work.
Oh, man, so this is what the zone feels like.
Ohh.
Analyze this.
We don't wanna go over the same area twice, so be thorough.
Thorough.
Got it.
More of a burnt umber, but I won't hold that against him.
"Pierce Havvthorne's ideas for ladies"?
Oh, please.
"Blond, long legs, with tennis racquet.
Asian Rockette.
Big boobs, redhead, but doctor, question mark".
Oh, he's not 100 percent on that one?
This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.
Okay, I don't have the codes.
Maybe Shirley and Troy are having better luck in the library.
Abed?
Abed?
If this is supposed to be like that part in that movie that's like this, I would like to remind you that I don't watch scary movies, and therefore cannot appreciate the homage!
Abed?
I hate reference humor.
Hold on.
I've been offended by this coat rack before.
Are we going in circles?
Okay.
So maybe I spent a little less time in the library than, say, the walk-in cereal closet, but it's definitely near here.
Skipped this door.
Pierce told me not to go in there.
Then it's probably the library.
Racist son of a-- Sodom and Gomorrah.
It's Pierce's special gym.
He never let me use it because he thinks I'm a child.
Hold-- He's hiding the indoor swing and I'm the child.
No, Troy, get out of there.
Why does he have so many collars?
- Secret dogs.
- Oh.
It's okay.
Come on.
Oh, no.
Forget you saw that, and then forget I knew what it was.
You won't tell me, Pierce won't tell me.
I have no idea what to Google.
I'll never know.
Dating Britta, you'll know too much too soon, soon enough.
What does Britta have to do with this?
Well, she's a modern woman, with experienced tastes.
I think it's nice you two are dating.
I hope she doesn't make you feel pressured.
Pressured to what?
To fulfill her expectations.
Expectations of what?
Heh-heh.
Never mind.
Unsatisfied with what?
I lost Abed.
I turned around and he disappeared.
Never let him out of your sight.
That goes double for holidays and wax museums.
How are we gonna find him?
I don't know, but we have to.
He's probably already looking for us.
Oh, well, that's Hallo-wine in Cougar Town for you.
Heh-heh-heh.
Oh, ladies, I'll follow you anywhere.
I do not have daddy issues.
You get two minutes.
Denial is the first step to acceptance.
That can't be.
Says the deny-ist.
Not a word.
Keep digging.
Confronting your issues now could prevent you from ending up haunted like Pierce.
I won't be Pierce.
Won't you?
No, I'm nothing like him.
Aren't you?
Gonna keep doing that?
Am I?
The worst therapist?
No, because you're not a therapist.
Since you're misdiagnosing by a mile, let me point out some differences.
Pierce was raised by his dad.
Mine took off when I was 8.
Pierce spent his life begging for scraps of his father's approval.
I moved on.
Maybe Pierce needs a dad, I don't.
Don't you?
Stop that!
Okay, if I need a dad so bad how come I've had his phone number for three weeks without the slightest urge to call him?
You found your dad?
Did I?
Give it here!
I remember when this show was about a community college.
No, you keep the fish sticks, senator.
Enjoy the boat show.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Just let me see the number!
No!
For medical purposes!
Help me heal your heart hole!
Never!
Jeffrey!
So this is where Pierce has been hiding the taste.
Here's to you, Cornelius.
Gone, but not forgiven.
Of course.
Otherwise it wouldn't be pointless.
This is pointless.
We have no Abed, no codes.
Pierce sent us on a wild goose chase.
Jeff was right.
I am naive.
Oh, don't listen to him.
Nothing naive about helping a friend.
Jeff would know that if he wasn't too cool for after-school specials.
Thanks.
Don't worry.
Abed's here.
I can feel him.
Maybe we should loop back to the indoor swing room.
Indoor swing?
That's ridiculous.
Someone's gonna break a lamp.
Break something on it.
Britta, while I applaud your gentle approach to psychoanalysis, I'm not gonna talk about it.
Hey, cut it out!
You're gonna break the door.
Well, look who came crawling back.
Not crawling, walking.
Quite briskly.
Follow.
I like talking to you, Annie.
It's easy.
I hope you feel like you can talk to me too.
Aww.
Spit it out.
No secrets between roomies.
Behind you.
I'm behind you too.
Hands.
Wall!
Not sure where you're going here, but just let it out.
Don't let it out!
Don't let it out!
All right, Pierce, turn off your haunted house!
Oh, my God, Pierce is dead.
Cornelius killed him.
I broke the remote!
Do you think it's expensive?
Please, Pierce.
Please, don't die slightly before your time.
This means we're next, and I care about us.
Where-- ?
Gotcha!
What the hell?
I totally had you guys convinced I was dead.
That'll teach you to value my presence.
Pierce.
Don't Pierce me.
You were going to Vicki's party without me.
Bet you didn't expect me to fake a haunted house to teach you a lesson.
Exactly what we expected.
Pierce, Vicki's the one that didn't invite you.
Why didn't you scare her?
Because I hate her.
Abed, where have you been?
I found Pierce's secret surveillance room.
He was faking a haunted house.
Abed Nadir with the late report.
Sorry, good montages take time.
Man, it was so easy.
Some shadows, a couple of mirror tricks.
A little custom-built latex walls and you're all crapping in your short pants.
Pretty impressive, particularly the figure you hired to watch you sleep.
Wow, that is creepy.
Standout performance.
Is he SAG?
What are you doing?
I didn't hire anyone.
Enough, Pierce.
Just open the damn door.
There's no ghost.
How do you explain this?
You probably asked someone to help you with your stupid prank and then forgot.
Uh-uh.
LeVar Burton was a hard no.
There's only one explanation.
I belittled my father's good name for a prank.
And his ghost has returned to scold me.
And probably butcher you guys for going along with it.
You think hiding in this room is gonna keep you safe?
Ghosts can't go through doors, stupid.
They're not fire.
Pierce, I am paying a teenager by the hour to care about my children so I can go to this party.
So you have to ask yourself, is the real threat out there or in here?
Fine, I'll open it myself.
No, no.
He'll scold me!
Someone's punching in the code.
Please, tell me one of us is outside.
May I be of some assistance?
Gilbert!
Gilbert, what are you doing in my house?
Well, technically it's my house.
After our father died, I became the sole inheritor of his estate, including all six houses and the decommissioned submarine.
- What?
- What?
So you came here to kick me out?
I came here to give you the deed, but on the day of my arrival, you were out.
I noticed mail piled up by the door.
I took it in, paid the overdue bills, replaced a few light bulbs, and, well, that was six weeks ago.
You've been living here in secret this whole time?
Yes, I'm ashamed to say that after a lifetime as Cornelius's assistant, I've had a difficult time adjusting to his passing.
It seems his absence has taken a greater toll than his presence ever did.
Taking care of Pierce gave my life purpose again.
But now that I've been discovered by your thin friend, I must apologize and bid you adieu.
Goodbye, Pierce.
There's a load of clean socks in the dryer.
Gilbert, wait, wait.
Look, I've been doing really well since Dad died, so I don't need anyone taking care of me.
But if you're having a tough time, well, I guess I could use a roommate.
Will there be anything else, brother?
Yes.
Bring it in.
Aww.
Have fun at the party.
Tell Vicki I say happy Halloween.
That'll mess with her.
You don't wanna come?
I've got a mask for you to wear.
One that doesn't zip at the mouth.
No, thanks.
I'll hang around here with Gilbert.
He needs me.
Oh, that's nice.
What was all that about masks?
Don't know, don't want to.
Fair enough.
Hey, how about you and I skip out on this party?
Why?
To do what and where?
Oh, I was thinking you could show me some Inspector Spacetime.
You're always talking about it.
I've never seen a full episode.
Oh!
Sure you want to?
It starts pretty slow.
First inspector couldn't even time-travel.
That sounds fine.
After a night of running in circles trying to untie Winger knots, I'm looking for something slow.
Sorry I ruined your night.
Actually, Pierce ruined my night, but you were right to let him.
Still wanna go to the party?
I heard Vicki bought dry ice and gave Leonard the wrong address.
Uh, I'll take a pass.
I have some unfinished business at home.
Troy.
Are you in here?
Abed, was that you?
I wanna show you something on the other side of the bookcase.
Troy?
Find me as soon as you can.
Who is in my house?
Gilbert!
Hijinks.
Indubitably.
Did it work?
Are you tall?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Take that, Blorgon.
Good show, inspector.
Oh, wow.
Heh.
There are 50 years of these, huh?
Yeah, isn't it great?
We can go anywhere and any time in the universe.
But it will probably be London during the blitz.
I think I got Abed to agree to let you come to the Inspector Spacetime convention.
Yay.
You watching Inspector Spacetime?
Why does he wake up so early?
Can't we just tell Abed we're sleeping together?
No.
No.
Abed's fragile.
We have to ease him into it, okay?
Do we want him to freak out and have to rescue him from some world where submarines are small enough to enter the bloodstream?
I totally wanna do that.
We need to go over the convention schedule again.
Go, go, go.
Just a minute.
Troy, it's a week away, and we need to revise our whole strategy.
Troy.
I've printed out several maps of the convention center and color-coded the best potential routes.
I have longer strides, but your superior physical fitness will allow you to compensate with greater speed.
One thing's sure.
We need to save time by changing into our costumes in the car.
Curling iron.
Thanks.
Coming.
Hi, Abed.
Just here for my breakfast date with Troy.
Oh Good morning, Britta.
I haven't seen you in over 12 hours.
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
I know you two are having sex.
I've known for weeks.
What?
Why didn't you say something?
I love doughnuts.
I can't count the reasons I should stay I need my sunglasses.
You don't need sunglasses to go to an Inspector Spacetime convention.
For an Inspector Spacetime convention, I'd need a bag to put over my head.
But Annie and I are going skiing.
That is the only reason I agreed to this road trip.
What are you doing here?
I always come early to save my seat.
And what's this about a road trip?
Look, Pierce, no one was trying to leave you out.
We just assumed you wouldn't be interested.
Which is why we left you out.
That's not fair.
Why can't I go to a Captain Warptime convention?
Because you'll ruin it.
I'm getting sick of everyone assuming that I have nothing to offer.
In ancient Greece, it was considered an honor to invite a person my age to a space convention?
We didn't invite Shirley either.
Well, that's better then.
All right.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Hey, yo!
Oh, I know.
Yeah.
I can't believe it, our first lnSpecTiCon.
It's beautiful.
Sure it's okay Britta's here?
She can wait in the car.
It's cool.
Find the booth where they take the gluon photo.
Two people are fused together like the inspector and Reggie were bonded for eternity in episode 704.
Oh.
Was there a female inspector?
Everyone hates her.
Not because they're sexist.
She sucks.
Well, I think it's cool.
Britta.
Annie.
You're on your own, AI Capone.
Everyone's entitled to their own opinion.
Am I the only one freaked out by that?
Abed was just showing that he's accepting of our relationship.
No, really.
What was it?
Hey, Annie, sad news.
They closed the ski slopes.
A dozen scouts got buried in an avalanche.
So sad.
I say we cut our losses and head home.
We're already here.
We can have fun hanging out at the convention.
I'd have more fun hanging outwith the parents that are circling the block.
Why are people staring at you?
They've never seen a man who's had sex before?
How many of those do you have?
Enough for the whole ride home.
Jeff.
UUhat?
We wanted it to be a surprise.
You bear resemblance to Inspector Spacetime's super villain Thoraxis.
Okay.
Now we're definitely leaving.
I've never been on an adult vacation.
This is the first time I've stayed in a hotel without a number in its name.
You can stay.
I'll be in my room.
Good.
The reservation's under my name.
Enjoy the nerds.
I will enjoy the Jeff won.
I know.
Abed, the gluon photo line looks really long.
We should get in it now.
Definitely.
Right after I find Toby.
Who's Toby?
Ha, ha.
Toby Weeks.
The biggest Inspector Spacetime fan in the world.
We've been e-mailing for months.
Oh.
You never mentioned him.
You've been busy lately having sex.
We talked about embracing change, so I'm expanding my social circle.
I just hope he makes it.
He works in Nigeria in banking.
He almost couldn't come.
His money was tied up.
I sent him Â£700 and a plane ticket.
He should be here.
Oh, Abed.
There he is.
You must be Abed.
Ha-ha-ha.
Inspector.
Ooh.
Before I forget, here is your check.
Thanking you very much indeed.
Nice.
You wouldn't believe how many people I e-mailed.
They completely ignored me.
Mm.
Toby, this is Britta.
Fraulein.
And my best friend, Troy.
Hm.
Where's your constable?
My best friend Andrew.
His wife wouldn't let him go at the last minute.
She's such a Minerva.
Minerva.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Minerva, what a bitch.
Was that the female inspector?
Not in front of Toby.
Hey, gluon line, we should probably get in it right now.
Alternatively, someone might just happen to have a pair of tickets to the sold-out panel: Which inspector would win in a fight in space?
Which inspector would win in a fight in time?
We can get that photo later.
Yeah, later.
That was when I wanted to take it.
Are you sure Troy and Abed want us here?
They do.
They just don't know it yet.
Remember, we're a couple of Captain Warphead fans.
Nobody will even notice we're here.
Excuse me.
Oh, yes?
Will you come with us?
Where?
Why?
When?
Okay.
Room service.
Yes, I'd like to order some food.
And how many people will be dining today, Mrs. Winger?
Oh, I'm not-- Two.
Yeah, I'd like a turkey burger and a second turkey burger, but with no bun.
My husband doesn't do carbs.
But he would like a scotch.
And what kind of scotch would your husband prefer?
The good kind.
I'll see what we can do.
Yes, Mrs. Winger?
Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but are you Nigel Cuthbertson, the actor who played Thoraxis?
Call me Nige.
We have every right to be here.
I don't know if you're being sexist, ageist, racist, or what, but I don't think I like your "ist".
Actually, we need your help.
We're focus-testing a new American version of Inspector Spacetime and you two represent several significant quadrants.
Oh, I don't know.
Your thoughts would be very valuable to us.
We're in.
Did you see-- ?
Christmas special?
Horrible.
When you consider what it set-- Brilliant.
Is that-- ?
Let's go.
What about the photo?
Do they even have to talk?
They could just touch tentacles and download.
This is good because, you know, Abed's branching out and Toby's really, really great.
No.
Troy, I have seen that look.
Girls have given me that look.
You are not being crazy.
That dude is trying to steal your boyfriend.
I'm gonna get a refill.
I mean, what if Abed wants to replace me?
It makes me so angry and sad all at the same time.
I know, but you have to hide it.
Because for some reason, men find these feelings to be psycho.
And if you freak out, it's only gonna push Abed away.
Like I always say, if you love someone, set them free.
And if they don't come back to you, they were never yours to begin with.
That makes no sense.
What if they get hit or fall down a well?
Remind me to not put you down as my emergency contact.
All right.
Play it cool.
Make nice with Toby.
Yeah.
So, what did everyone think?
I thought it was pretty good.
I was confused.
And what confused you?
The time travel mostly.
Also the space travel.
Anything else?
How many clipboards you got?
Raise the Klaxon.
Me lorry's plunging it into the Thames, methinks.
Hey, do you mind if I practice my American accent?
I have an audition.
Of course.
You really are an Inspector Spacetime fan.
Ever since I was little.
What is it you like about the show?
I think the show's philosophy poses some really interesting questions About the nature of-- I'm so sorry.
Bow before Thor-axis-.
This is my ringtone.
Bow before Thor-axis- Okay, seriously, what was it?
You wear glasses?
You have a back brace?
Ha-ha-ha.
Say it.
I don't care.
And I asked myself, what does space smell like?
You see, the thing of it Oh, hey, there you guys are.
Oh This is so nice, just three friends, friending around all unthreatened-like.
Sorry.
This is slightly embarrassing.
I seem to have forgotten your name.
It's Troy!
You know it's Troy!
Okay, it's the first part of Troy and Abed.
Toby and Abed in the morning?
That's ridiculous.
I'm not psycho!
Okay.
Uh, where was I?
Troy's been acting weird.
Same with my constable when he got a wife.
I now have one ticket to the 50th anniversary convention in London.
DemiCenlnSpectiCon?
It's soon and London's too far.
Creme Eggs are sold year-round.
I thought that was a legend.
Past life as an Just a minute.
Just a second.
I've got your hair dryer, Mrs. Winger.
Thank you, Randy, but it's not for me.
It's for my husband.
He needs the diffuser for his hair.
It sounds shallow, but he's a lawyer.
Actually, having dual careers has put a lot of stress on our marriage.
Hence the separate rooms.
But I think this trip is really gonna change all that.
My husband will finally see me not as a world-famous police detective, but as a woman.
Your husband's a lucky man.
That he is.
Mm.
Tastes of bog.
You see?
It's funny because it's clear.
Ha-ha-ha.
I would like to say something.
I am friends with a couple of huge Inspector Spacetime fans.
I think what they like about the show is that it's smart, complicated, doesn't talk down to its audience.
So if you'd like to make a really good American version, you should stay true to that.
Oh.
Hey, instead of this constable, what about a blonde with long legs and a tennis racket?
Yeah.
Please, for me.
Bow before Normally we don't concern ourselves with adultery, because then hotels wouldn't exist.
But everyone here thinks you're so nice.
So I had to bring you down here.
I don't believe it.
He told me he was leaving.
Say your catchphrase.
I'd rather not.
What the hell is going on here?
Suddenly our marriage isn't worth repairing?
What?
Wait, Nigel is married?
That is so Thoraxis.
And your American accent isn't at all convincing.
We come all this way and you just leave me alone without so much as sending a text message?
I am sick of it, Jeff-- Nigel Winger.
Can I get two more of these, please?
Enough!
This day has turned crazy.
I'm gonna go upstairs, towel off, and pray to God that I wake up in the middle of a final for a class I didn't know I was enrolled in.
Shoo.
Oh, honey.
You went all psycho girlfriend on Abed, didn't you?
Yeah.
I screwed up.
Classic Troy.
It's okay.
It happens to the best of us.
I got you a present.
A quantum spanner.
Yeah, it lights up or plays music or something.
Britta, would you agree to be bonded to me forever in the gluon chamber for an expensive photograph?
Absolutely.
Thank you.
What?
I can't wait.
We can visit the original Spacetime set.
I've got a spare bedroom.
Stay as long as you like.
Sounds great.
But I don't know if I could leave.
I have a life here.
For now.
What do you mean?
Well, neurotypicals don't have the same focus you or I have.
They always get distracted by marriage, kids, competitive cooking shows.
Like your best friend David.
That's right.
Planning on coming even though you were trapped in Nigeria?
Yeah, I wouldn't say trapped.
You went to me and not your friend for help?
His wife deleted the e-mail.
She's a total Minerva.
Minerva.
Right.
You're dressed as the inspector famous for trying to strangle Dudley because they were pursuing Linda.
David doesn't exist.
You're mad.
Nothing you've said can prove that.
You said his name was Andrew.
Bollocks.
Yeah.
All right.
Guilty as charged.
Look, I had to be sure, didn't I?
When you sent that e-mail in which you figured out Inspector Spacetime is both his own grandfather and grandmother, I knew we were soul mates.
You and I are special.
Neurotypicals won't admit it, but some people are better than everybody else.
They can't handle it, so they leave.
Like how the brilliant inspector has constant adventures while his constables always return to their dull, ordinary Earth lives.
Maybe there's a reason the inspector always chooses a human companion.
His human friends keep him grounded and invested in the world, like with me and Troy.
If I could Winger you.
Sure.
I don't know what that means.
Maybe all relationships are made up of logical inspectors and emotional constables, and we need both to make space and time a better place.
Maybe you're right.
Wait, wait.
Toby, Toby.
Toby, no.
Wait just a second.
Just playing a game.
You have to let me out.
Not until Stockholm syndrome sets in.
How long do you think that will be, hours?
Would you love me if I got you a churro?
Annie.
Annie, I have-- I'm not sure how much air there is in here.
And still you talk.
Troy will find me.
Who?
You know who Troy is.
Yeah.
Troy will find me.
Okay, just hold it there.
Okay, and right here.
Everything okay?
Everything's fine.
What is a gluon anyway?
Can we stop talking about Abed?
I'm sorry.
I can't.
It doesn't feel right.
It's okay, I understand.
Go to him.
Are you sure?
I've told you before.
I don't care about Inspector Spacetime.
Toby.
Where's Abed?
He's packing.
He said you have a girlfriend and don't need him anymore.
He's coming with me to England.
You're lying.
How would you know?
Because Abed's my friend, and he would have told me.
And he would have explained it to me in very clear terms because I get confused sometimes.
He's in there, isn't he?
Ha-ha-ha.
No.
Hey, Troy.
Hey, Abed.
Toby, have you ever been in a fight?
Because I have.
Oh, my God.
He can make a fist.
That would hurt harder than a slap.
He's in that one.
I know that.
You okay?
I am.
You know, for the first time in my long history of being locked inside things, I knew someone would come.
Still wanna take the gluon photo?
What do you think?
YE, YE, Well, I just went upstairs and saw your room.
Saw the two robes, the two coffee cups, one with lipstick, one without.
And I saw actual hair that looked a lot like mine on my side of the sink, so I have some questions.
Oh, God.
First one, is that actually my hair?
And, if so, did it fall out naturally?
If it did, you need to tell me right now because I have to call science.
Also, what the hell is going on?
All right, I may have been play-acting that we were married and then the staff thought you were cheating, and I had to save face.
Do I have to worry about this?
No, I was just daydreaming.
I've married you at least a half a dozen times.
And Troy.
And Zac Efron.
Mostly Zac Efron.
Does Zac get a drink thrown in his face?
I don't know.
I guess I was a little hurt that you ditched me.
I mean, we are friends, right?
Would it have been that painful to hang out together?
Well, I can tell you one thing your fantasy got wrong.
If we were married, you wouldn't find me flirting with another woman in a hotel bar.
But there are a lot of things that you think are fun that I wouldn't wanna do because I'm-- Older?
Not lame.
Do you wanna hang out now?
Can I buy you a drink?
What do you want?
An appletini.
Oh, God, don't make me order that.
Please?
Please?
Heh.
Appletini.
That is so great.
And I have a surprise for you guys.
Pow.
Really pushing me here.
He's back.
Do you mind if we crash this party?
That we already crashed.
Pierce, Shirley, I'm glad you made it.
It was rude of me not to invite you.
Sorry.
Just remember, Abed, I did my best.
We both did.
You're welcome.
So I guess we're taking off.
Actually, I'd like to stay for a little while.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You don't have to do that for me.
Well, who says it's just for you?
Guys, get your phones ready.
Because you are only gonna see this once.
Bow before Thoraxis!
Get your camera out.
See, this is why I don't hang with you folks on the weekends.
Here we are, the 1960s, the greatest, grooviest period in the entire history of the entire universe.
I'm lucky.
I get to visit places like this because I can travel through time and space, but not both at once.
Do you know why that is, ensign?
Because, Inspector Spacetime, our minds would be blown with the space-time confusion.
That's right.
And now I must sleep with the sexiest woman here who is also my grandmother.
Or I will cease to exist.
How do you know I'm not your grandmother?
There's only one way to find out.
I hate you.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Look, 12:00.
History of Ice Cream class is letting out.
It's as informative as it is delicious.
That class should've been ours.
I hear the final is a sundae bar.
I don't get history.
If I wanted to know what happened in Europe a long time ago, I'd watch Game of Thrones.
That show takes place in a fantasy realm.
This is about the real world.
Not the show.
You need to think before you speak.
I hear this teacher's a real hard-ass.
He's British and has a degree.
I can't have a hard-buns teacher.
I'm starting a business.
When am I supposed to see my family?
Ben took his first steps without me.
Quick impression: "Wah".
Who am I?
You guys.
Ha.
Dead on.
I know The History of Ice Cream would have been fun but not only will this class be much less likely to give us type 2 diabetes, we might actually learn so-- Son of a bitch.
Those annoying Germans are back?
I thought they transferred after they lost their foosball scholarship.
I heard they were juicing.
No, them leaving would mean Greendale got slightly better, which, as we know, does not happen.
Lukas, Karl, I see you've grown a new douche bag.
My name is Reinhold.
I believe you know my brother, Juergen.
There was some bad blood between you two,ja?
Hmm.
Don't worry.
If there is one thing Germans don't do, it's hold a grudge.
Unless we're talking Die Hard 3.
Or the 20th century.
Morning, everyone.
Morning, sir.
I am Professor Cornwallis.
I know what you're all thinking, and the answer is yes.
I am a direct descendant of General Sir Charles Cornwallis who surrendered the British forces at Yorktown.
Was anyone thinking that?
No.
History is written by the victors.
Of course, we all know the quote.
What does it mean?
According to Oxford University, it means that my 20 years' loyal service there means nothing next to a little slipup with a coed.
Ahem.
But what it really means is that history can be seen from a multitude of vantage points.
So for your first test on Monday-- Oh Oh, come on.
I'm confused.
When do we get our ice cream?
I want to challenge you to look at history from all perspectives.
How would the story read if it was written not by the victors, but by the vanquished?
Ja, how indeed?
I was recalling a very funny episode of the German version of The Nanny.
Franlein gets a-- It wouldn't translate.
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said It can be here We could be roped up, tied up Dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one They all just fade away And I still have those pants.
True story.
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, we have fun.
Aah!
Sorry.
I should've realized that might be startling.
Dr. Ken Kedan, Greater Greendale Mental Health Services.
Kevin, does this gentleman look familiar to you?
I'm sorry.
He doesn't.
Kevin?
Uh-uh.
His name is Chang.
Oh, of course.
That explains the note.
"Hello, my name is Kevin.
I have Changnesia"?
What is that?
Not uncommon for victims of memory loss to experience syntactical confusion.
Thus, the inappropriate insertion of his name into an unrelated phrase.
No, he's always dean that.
Once we learned of the connection to Greendale, we realized it'd be the perfect environment for immersive therapy.
What?
No, absolutely not.
I can't have an unbalanced nut job traipsing around on my campus.
Put that on the rack, put that in the fridge.
Get him out of here.
Sorry.
Your school board already signed off on it.
Kevin is now your responsibility.
Ahhhh!
I just felt a disturbance.
Did you have dairy this morning?
Could be that.
Or it could be that great evil is nearby.
I'll take a provisional Lactaid.
Won't be needing the Lactaid.
Uh, guys, this is our study room.
Please leave.
And take that mushroom cloud of Drakkar with you.
Why must he hurt so with his words?
He's like a less funny Hans Rickles.
I'm not here to argue, Angela Jerk-els.
Beat it.
Oh!
Someone must've changed the channel to USA because I just watched a Burn Notice.
Heh.
Who's Angela Jerk-els?
I can assure you, we are here for no reason other than to study.
Our usual off-campus haunt, Der Kaffee Hausen is closed for the shooting of an esoteric art film.
Tomorrow it shall reopen and we shall be out of your heavily product-laden hair.
Heh.
Jeff, it's just a little table in the corner of the room.
Why don't we just let them have it?
That's called appeasement.
And everyone knows if you give the Germans something small, like the study room or Austria, they end up wanting something big, like Earth.
Jeff's right.
If there were more people in the world like Annie, we'd all be speaking Vietnamese right now.
That was my war.
I had flashbacks for years.
Pierce, you moved to Canada.
And it was hell.
Those people call ham "bacon".
This is silly.
I'm just gonna walk over there and tell them they are welcome to share our room.
Delightful.
So today, we study in here.
Undtonight, we dine in hell.
Doktor Blitz, Knight of the Atlantis Guild, wielder of the four-pronged trident in "Spawncraft".
How did you know?
I recognized your catchphrase: "Tonight we dine in hell"!
I'm Spacetimer 8032.
You are Spacetimer 8032?
The one and only.
It's wonderful to meet you, brother.
What was that all about?
You two seemed pretty chummy.
That man saved my life.
In a video game.
Let me get this as straight as I can get things.
You authorized this?
After everything that happened last year?
Hear us out.
They offered money.
Did it ever occur to you that this man is a psychopath who may be faking his own Changnesia?
Oh.
Now he has me saying it.
Amdeansia.
Amdeansia.
I'm all turned around.
If he is faking, you're welcome to prove it.
We get the money either way.
Uhn!
Oh, I will prove it.
And I'll have fun doing it.
Now, what to wear?
See?
I know those guys were annoying yesterday but aren't you glad we didn't turn it into a whole big macho war thing?
You're right.
I can't believe I doubted you.
Hey, what's that sound you make when you see something shocking?
That's it.
What are you doing at our table?
What happened to Der Kaffee Hausen?
Our time in this room yesterday proved more pleasant than expected.
It's got a good energy.
That table is ours.
This room is ours.
You guys need to leave.
Hey, Karl.
Hi, Abed.
I am afraid it is you who must do the making like a tree which is to say leaving.
Security.
You want us to leave?
There a problem here?
Yeah.
These DUssel-dorks won't leave our study room.
Nice.
I don't understand any of these puns.
I think I need to learn history.
You have a sign-in sheet?
You're asking for our papers?
I thought this was America, not Arizona.
We have a sign-in sheet.
Lukas.
Perhaps we should all just go home and see our families and think things through?
Looks like the room is theirs.
Shirley, call your babysitter, because this means-- Let me guess.
War?
Let the lady finish her sentence.
Thank you, Jeff.
War.
Yeah.
We'd like to sign out Study Room F. It would appear that in this battle, our bulge was a little bit bigger.
Guten bye-bye.
Excuse me.
Don't touch.
Damn them and their perfectly crafted timepieces.
What else do you have available?
It's like a Darren Aronofsky film.
I'll get this.
My fifth father-in-law was an electrician.
You pick up a thing or two.
Heh-heh.
Everybody grab me, please!
Nobody grab him.
Aah!
Pierce, just let go.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Of the thing, Pierce.
It smells like barbecue.
Oh.
We're getting up earlier tomorrow.
Hmm?
Oh.
Oh!
Oh, look at them.
Hi.
Thanks again for taking me in.
We must have been great pals before my Changnesia, huh?
Oh, my-- That's it.
You may have fooled that handsome doctor but you can't fool me.
Oh, how convenient.
Showing up here with Changnesia after you staged a coup, almost blew up the school, and locked me in a basement for months.
Without so much as a drop of moisturizer.
I did all that?
I mean, Chang did all that?
If that's true, then Chang, who is me, deserves to go to jail.
Well, he did.
And you do.
This is the worst thing that's happened to me in my 96 hours of memory.
And that failed ventriloquist's name was Slobodan MiloÃ©eviÃ©.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
For the essay portion of your test on Monday, you will be asked to describe a historical battle from the perspectives of both the winners and the losers.
Ooh.
No dioramas.
Guten luck on the examination.
We will be preparing for it in Study Room F, as in "fictory".
I like the way your old chair cradles mein k'naidels.
Ha-ha-ha.
I just made that up.
English is my second language.
Jeff, stop.
It's over.
No.
These guys are horrible.
Totally.
Except Karl.
Really, Abed?
Karl's not horrible?
Even though he took your home?
When I was growing up, it was just me and my mom.
I didn't have much of a family, that is, until I met you guys.
So excuse me if I'm not willing to give up the place where we became a family.
So, what are we gonna do?
We literally can't get up any earlier.
Many years ago, before the concept of "too soon" existed, there was a show about a bunch of goofy Nazis running a prison camp, and that show was called-- Hogan's Heroes?
Hogan's Heroes.
Yeah.
And while, for a latchkey kid with no Jewish friends, it was a bit desensitizing, it still taught me that the lovable misfits always win and the bumbling Germans always lose.
All we need is a clever ruse-- Strike that.
All we need is a ruse.
You had me at "ruse".
That was the last thing I said.
Good thing you said it.
Welcome to Oktoberfest.
What is this?
Call it a peace offering.
You won, we lost.
Let's end this dumb war and move on.
Care for some authentic blutwurst?
This stuffs the real deal.
We got it down in Little Munich.
It's been banned by the FDA.
Ooh.
No, Karl.
That blutwurst was probably injected with a laxative to make us pull a Grete Waitz in our trousers.
I promise you, there's nothing gross in this sausage.
It's just pig's blood stuffed into a cow's intestine.
Gott, that must be nearly Idiot.
Do not accept their gifts.
Something is clearly up.
Please, these are just small tokens of our friendship.
Oh, come on.
Dirndls, blutwurst, luftballons.
A cartoonishly large cake.
This is a ruse.
It is exactly like an episode of Hogan's Villains.
Ruse?
This is no ruse.
Just take that large cake back to the study room and enjoy it there.
So there's nothing hiding inside this giant German chocolate cake?
Ask Abed.
You can trust him.
He's a friend.
Nope.
Just solid cake.
Mm.
Then you wouldn't mind if I cut the cake?
Or save it for later.
You don't have to share it.
Shirley stayed up all night baking that for you.
I just used the eggs I would've used for my son's breakfast.
But it would be so easy for me to carve into this cake and serve us all.
Wait!
Damn it.
Sorry.
We thought you were stupider than this.
Troy.
Should I release the tear gas or has that ship sailed?
An excellent attempt, Winger, but we are smarter than you.
And once again, it shall be us who are savoring the smooth and somewhat happy taste of victory.
Beer me, bitte.
Here you go.
As they say in Ferris Bueller, "dankeschÃ©n.
" And as they say in the movie Gotcha: Gotcha.
Busted.
Busted?
For what?
But there were dozens of students at that Oktoberfest.
But you were the only German students celebrating German culture.
And here at Greendale, that is a big fat no-no.
We frown on anyone celebrating their own cultural heritage.
I mean, if the Hasidic Student Union wants to host a Kwanzaa celebration, you go, Jews.
Hanukkah?
No, sir.
It's why I keep a detailed list of every student's race and nationality.
To prevent racism and nationalism.
This is an outrage.
Relax.
It's not like you're expelled.
You're just banned from certain campus amenities.
Water fountains, swimming pools.
Most of these are water-based.
Oh, and the study rooms.
I gotta take this.
Bye-bye.
Dean Pelton.
If I don't offer you a receipt, your education is free.
Chang did what?
Oh, cool.
What are we protesting?
You guys.
You've been hogging that study room for three years.
Somebody finally stood up to you, and you had them banned.
Why must our people always be the victims?
What do we want?
Justice!
When do we want it?
Now!
What do we want?
Justice!
Oh, my God.
This whole time we thought the Germans were the Germans but it turns out, we're the Germans.
Hang on.
You guys are all siding with the Germans?
You realize these guys are, like, contractor-grade tools.
They signed out that room fair and square and then you had to take it too far, like you always do with that room.
Yeah!
Damn it!
I signed this room out!
And I have a final tomorrow!
They lost a pen.
Come back in a few hours, we're playing "Dungeons & Dragons".
Yes?
I left my notebook.
Come back later.
I'm trying to prove a point.
You're like those guys on Hogan's Heroes, the Nazis.
You take that back.
I'm Jewish.
Yeah, Leonard.
Don't call me a Nazi.
You are wearing an SS T-shirt.
Oh.
Oh!
Oh.
Open 2.
What are you doing here?
You, sir, have been bailed out.
We are going to nurse you back to health.
Ha-ha-ha.
But why?
Why take me back in after everything I did to you?
When I heard you had checked into jail, I realized you couldn't be faking.
The real Chang would never have remorse for what he did.
I believe you, Kevin.
Plus, curing Changnesia, that's a human-interest story.
Puts Greendale on the map.
But your health comes second-- Whoop.
First, to the school.
Oh, let's not hug.
Do you mind getting my-- ?
Okay.
Probably shouldn't step on it.
I feel guilty eating this cake.
And not for the usual reasons.
This is what happens when a group of people blindly follows a charismatic golden-throated leader.
Are you comparing me to Hitler?
Yeah.
There are similarities.
Hang on.
Nobody's even willing to consider that I might be the Hitler of this group?
We were the good guys.
How could everybody think we're the bad guys?
We are.
When Karl and I were raiding the Diamond North Caves, I was facing 50 death beetles.
He saved me.
When I had a chance to return the favor, I told him it was solid cake.
You were just following orders.
There's probably a way I can make it up to him.
Oh.
I'll give him my four-pronged trident.
Why not call it a quadrident?
Shh.
Ah.
There you people are.
I believe we have something to discuss.
Oh, my God.
You clever British bastard.
You set this up to teach us a lesson.
What?
Making the school pretend to hate us to show us that one man's hero is another man's villain.
Of course.
We aren't Nazis.
I tip my cap to you, sir.
Lesson learned.
Are you actually suggesting that a professor at Greendale would set up an elaborate ruse just to teach seven students a lesson?
Yes.
That's a Wednesday.
Oh, my God.
I've made a terrible mistake coming here.
So this wasn't part of the class?
Then why are you here?
You had a test today, and you all missed it.
F's for everyone.
Oh.
Maybe it's not too late to get out of my contract.
I really am Hitler.
Yeah.
So it's just decided?
No vote or anything?
I hate this.
I wish there was a way that we could make it up to people.
That's it.
We need to make reparations.
We have to start giving back because Greendale has given us so much.
It gave us the study room.
And that study room is our home.
But our home is more than those four walls.
And our family is more than the seven of us.
It's all of Greendale.
And everyone deserves to have what we have.
What do you know?
Greendale just got slightly better.
It's good to be back.
Should we go celebrate at Skeeper's?
Oh, come on, Shirley.
We all have lives.
There you are.
I am so proud how you stepped up and made amends.
And everyone forgave you.
Because when it comes right down to it, Greendale's a forgiving place.
It really is.
Keep that in mind the next 20 seconds.
Remember that people can Chang.
People can what?
Hmm?
Hi, I'm Kevin.
He has Changnesia.
And you know what that sound is.
It's the Troy and Abed podcast.
Sponsored by Shirley's Sandwiches, home of the fried-chicken skin wrap.
Is it inside?
Is it outside?
You find out.
Our guest today is from Germany.
Karl, guten tag.
How are you doing?
Great.
Now's the part where we get real.
Friendship, loyalty, betrayal, redemption.
Is this an apology?
Yes.
For being a guest, we want you to have this.
Gift certificate to Shirley's Sandwiches, home of the triple-fried Monte Cristo.
We challenge you to taste the bread.
This coupon is a $5 bill.
That's all the time we have.
For Troy Barnes, I'm Abed Nadir.
For Abed Nadir, I'm Troy Barnes.
And we're out.
Thanks for doing this.
So will you be on my podcast tomorrow?
We've got a thing.
Pee-pee-pow.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Well, see you after the break.
What you doing for Thanksgiving?
I'm having Andre's family over.
Though he'll be stuck working for Black Friday.
Oh, sure, you get to say that, but we're stuck calling it Jew Friday.
Ugh.
I'll be with my family, fielding the same old questions.
"How's community college"?
"What's your major"?
"Are those real"?
My aunt's boyfriend.
"Aw.
My family's a normal religion.
I have to talk to them for five minutes before I get a casserole that's all marshmallow".
That's you.
Brainstorm.
Why don't you all come to my house?
I'll have plenty of food.
Marshmallows!
Sounds good.
Was gonna microwave noodles.
This sounds promising.
I'm in.
Goody.
You're all welcome, of course.
I'm in.
Or, you know, Jeff or whoever.
Can't.
Plans.
If you change your mind, can't think of anyone who'd enjoy you more.
How-dean, pilgrims?
Is that-- ?
John Wayne.
Yes.
Oh, good, you got it.
Anyhoo, I just thought I'd mosey on over here, invite you all to Greendale's annual thanks-living potluck dinner, where we remember all we have to be thankful for.
There may be a link to enrollment at Greendale and holiday suicide.
Oh.
Just a shoelace and belt-free night full of fun.
You should all drop by.
Or Jeff, or whoever.
He can't.
He has plans.
Right, you are spending Thanksgiving with your father.
I thought I told you to stop reading my e-mail.
Yeah, well, I thought I told you to stop keeping secrets.
How am to keep track of what you tell me in confidence and what I hear through your walls with a glass to my ear?
Fine.
Close your mouths.
I'm having Thanksgiving with my estranged father.
Move on.
Makes sense.
Jeff's at a point in his life where he needs a strong father figure to come out to.
Jeff, this is huge news.
Huger news.
Was this decision made after our Halloween conversation?
Yes, after, not because of.
I'll take it.
You had that teed up?
When I say "thera", you say "pist" Thera Pist Thera-- Aw.
Thanks for the support.
Oh, the support has just begun.
What do you want me to bring to Papa Winger's house?
Vegan pumpkin pie?
Britta, you're not coming.
Fine, regular pumpkin pie.
You're gonna need me when things get messy and emotional.
The thing that will get emotional is Troy when he realizes there are yams under those marshmallows.
I knew it was too good to be true.
Jeff, speaking not just as your friend but as an avid daytime-TV watcher, these parent-child reunions can get intense.
Chairs might be thrown, weaves might be pulled.
Or I could just go in there, show him how awesome I am, no thanks to him, meet my half-brother and then, boom, closure.
Your dad has another son?
Yeah.
So clearly, he's moved on.
Why can't I?
Close your mouths.
Look, I appreciate your concern.
But the most helpful thing you can do is stay out of my business.
Oh.
Can you say that last part again?
These walls are entirely too thick.
Give me some rope Tie me to a dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said It can be here We could be roped up, tied up Dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one They all just fade away Oh!
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
Hey.
Let's carve that jive turkey.
Got that out of your system?
Yeah.
I'm happy to welcome you to my home.
Â©hu iï¬hmk yam, Come in.
Take your coats off.
Make yourself comfortable.
Browse the available literature about Jesus as your personal savior, or not.
No agenda.
Heh, heh, heh.
Are you gonna pass some apps soon or do I have to die of starvation to prove a point?
This is Mr. Bennett, my father-in-law.
Dad, these are my friends from college.
Oh, yeah.
That's Andre's people.
They're a bunch of characters.
That's a good one, Dad.
Oh.
I brought something.
Dip.
Oh, Abed, why is this seven-layer dip so puffy?
Been in the fridge for two years.
Saving it for a special occasion.
So thoughtful.
I'm gonna put this on a nice platter with crackers in the trash.
Where's Britta?
Hey, Jeff.
What's up?
What's up is closure.
I met my dad, we talked things out as men.
I think I'm ready to move on.
Really, in 20 minutes'?
Fine.
Look, I couldn't do it.
I was at the front door, in control, and then I started thinking about all that stuff you said about messiness.
Threw me off my game.
The irony is after all your pestering that I deal with my daddy issues, you're the reason I'm not meeting my father.
Or maybe I'm the reason you'll come here after all.
Britta, I-- Wait.
What do you mean by here?
Your dad's house, where I kind of, sort of, am.
Yeah, thanks, Sharon.
I never thought about it that way.
Batman is sort of gay.
Be right back.
What is going on?
Why is Thanksgiving so terrible?
I know.
The tension, the backbiting, the judgmental comments.
This makes Thanksgiving with my family look-- Eh.
Still pretty bad.
I said Batman was gay.
Huh.
Sheesh.
You ask one lady if she's Tyler Perry in drag and suddenly, you're the bad guy.
It's a reference.
That's my humor.
Abed gets it.
Oh, you're all hiding out in here.
Yeah.
You know us, hide away.
"Hiding"?
Well, be careful.
You might be giving the impression that you prefer the cold garage to the warm hearth of my hospitality.
What?
As if.
Yay.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Well, hurry back soon.
Okay.
This is the Jonestown of dinners.
Feel like I'm in jail.
You know what happens to guys like me in jail.
They get really into push-ups.
I am fine with my upper body the way it is.
It did feel like a prison, and that meant only one thing made sense conceptually.
We had to break out.
And someone with the gravitas of Morgan Freeman had to narrate it.
We need to do a prison break.
Happy Thanksgiving?
You really "you'd" this one, huh?
Okay, yes, I meddled against your wishes and I got this address from the dean.
But, hey, you had a moment of doubt, and here I am to help you through it.
Psychology tells us there are no accidents.
Oh, really?
What about car accidents?
Tara Reid, or the Hindenburg?
Here goes nothing.
Hello, William.
So, uh, how about we make a couple of ground rules?
Actually, that sounds good.
No hugs.
Wouldn't want one.
No apologies.
Wouldn't accept one.
No calling you "dad".
No expectations.
No BS.
Drink?
Eighteen?
Scotch.
Neat.
I just want to acknowledge there are a lot of emotions flowing right now.
You two are probably feeling a strong impulse to sleep with each other, and hey, that's normal.
Wow.
I'll get the drinks.
So how about that?
No muss, no fuss.
Jeff, I urge you not to run from the muss and fuss.
Hi.
Hi.
You must be my half-brother.
Your hands are so much bigger than mine.
Your nail beds are perfect.
I can't do it.
I can't.
Oh, God.
Ugh.
Oh, it's coming up.
When I get upset, I vomit.
Oh, I see you've met Willy, Jr. You said he wasn't gonna replace me.
He's the Schwarzenegger.
I'm the DeVito.
I get it.
Okay, fellas, let's get right into it.
I think the big question on everyone's mind is why don't I go help Willy, Jr.?
Hm?
One thing was clear to me and the crew.
Bennett lockup was not where we belonged.
We belonged in the sun, with the wind in our hair.
Maybe at a Bennigan's, enjoying a Turkey O'Toole.
We should tunnel out.
Abed, Shirley is our friend, and we're guests in her home.
We need a plan that won't hurt her feelings or damage her property.
Definitely don't look behind that poster, then.
I could pretend to have a stroke.
Do a gibberish foreign language.
What if I did a gibberish foreign language like Star Wars?
You'd like that, I bet.
Dick.
Look, I'm sure we'll figure out a way out of here.
What's important right now is that we stick together.
Yeah.
Oh, there you are.
Who wants a pre-dinner snack?
Oh!
Oh, pumpkin, what's wrong?
It's too embarrassing to talk about in front of the guys.
Know what I mean, girlfriend?
Oh, sweetie.
Do you have your monthly shame?
Do you wanna lie down in Elijah's room?
Oh, I don't think that's gonna cut it.
I probably need to go home, call Dr. Collins.
It's that bad.
Oh, my sister-in-law's a gynecologist.
She's right in the other room.
There's no need to bother your doctor on a holiday.
Go ahead.
Mm-hm.
I'd like to tell you Annie avoided Shirley's doctor sister-in-law, but this ain't no fairy tale.
This is Thanksgiving.
Let's see, what else?
You've got some diabetes on my mother's side.
Good to know.
I like your hair.
The presence of it, I mean.
So I have a question.
It's been weighing on me pretty heavily.
At your age, in the bedroom Oh, yeah.
It's all good.
Yeah.
Real good.
Look at them.
Bonding.
Probably laughing because I can't grow a beard.
I have an idea.
Why don't we use these dinner rolls to do some role play?
I see what I did there.
Okay.
This roll, this is me.
He's crying.
Good.
That's really good.
So, what do you do?
I'm a lawyer who faked a bachelor's degree and practiced law for seven years before I got caught.
Ha, ha.
Like your hustle.
Reminds me of the summer I was Ralph Lauren in Saint-Tropez, '83.
I'm on a boat with-- Damn it, Willy.
I'm expressing.
Knock it off.
Why can't you just swallow it like any normal person?
Oh, heh, heh.
Oh!
Right, like your new son.
Like mister-- Mr. I've-Got-My-Shirt-- I don't know personal details about you.
Well, my name's Jeff.
Don't help me, Mr. Helper-Guy.
First Mom dies, now this?
Hey, she died 20 years ago, Willy.
He keeps singing the same old song.
Oh.
She died on you.
Here I thought you'd become Father of the Year, but you just got stuck.
Yeah, well, look, I don't have to tell you, I'm not a natural caretaker, but with Willy, you know, I checked all the boxes and he still turned out softer than wet cheese.
I don't get it.
He keeps saying he's gonna move out next week since '03.
Oh, man, I couldn't wait to get out.
I got my own place when I was 18.
I was the same way.
So who's ready to eat?
Jeff, you care to carve the turkey?
I knew it!
You love him more than me.
I'll show you.
I'll run away.
Oh, please.
Hey, be my guest.
You run away, and I'm gonna sleep like a baby tonight.
Oh, now, I'm sorry you guys had to see that, but maybe you could shrink his head, since you're here, for some reason.
Yes.
I can do this.
Show me on the dinner roll where you're hurt!
That's how it went for the afternoon.
This tag- team turkey day became our routine.
We endured the indignities as best we could.
Cousins fighting, complaints about the food, listening to a nephew do Borat for a full hour.
We figured out ways to steal away from time to time, saying we had to pee, had to get ice, had to do a Jewish thing in the other room.
I became known as the guy who could get you things.
Piece of gum, Playing cards, some novelty glasses I found in a box marked "crap".
In those brief, tranquil moments, we felt human.
We felt free.
But sooner or la ter, our warden would come knocking.
Mostly, we just waited for our time to be served, but some didn't take kindly to waiting.
Some didn't have much time left.
Enough.
Amateur hour is over.
I'm going in there, pretend to break a hip, and we'll be sipping sambuca at Skeeper's in no time.
Whoa.
He tripped on the rug.
Wait, now he's getting up.
He's walking around dazed like he's got a head injury.
Groin into the corner of the table.
This might actually work.
Wait, wait, why are people laughing?
Let's see, I need a broom or a rake or two rakes.
Pierce, you were supposed to pretend to injure yourself so we could leave.
Leave?
This is my Showtime at the Apollo.
I'm killing out there.
Pierce was our last hope, or so we thought.
It seemed Troy Barnes had a plan.
What if we got sick?
No.
No more faking illnesses.
Not fake sick.
Real sick.
And that's when I told my old firm to shove it.
I've always been more of a free agent.
Yeah, I can see that about you.
You seem like a self-made man.
Well, I kind of had to be.
Look, if it's okay with you, I'd like to break a rule.
I know we said no mushy stuff, but for what it's worth, I'm proud of you.
Wow.
Thanks.
Makes you think, huh?
Wait, what do you mean?
Well, look, I mean, you've seen how Willy turned out.
I mean, I haven't done that kid any favors.
And so I look at you, so self-reliant and well-adjusted, and I think maybe I did something right.
You did something right?
Well, let me say that different.
Uh Universe is a constantly expanding-- Stop.
I get the impulse.
Not gonna work.
No, I just mean that we are defined by what happens to us, and me leaving seems to have made you independent, made you strong.
With all due respect, which is none, go to hell.
So tunneling out is off the table?
Who's hungry for turkey?
Shirley, we were just-- About to-- Eat garbage dip.
Why did I have to go third?
Look, I get it.
You wanna leave.
Shirley, we're sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
To be honest, I invited you as a bit of a buffer.
With Andre's family, I'm the butt of the joke.
With Andre gone this year, I thought I could tip the scales in my favor by having a few friends around.
That was wrong of me.
See you Monday.
I can't believe none of us noticed she was having such a hard time.
We can't leave.
Funny thing about prison.
Sometimes the person you thought was your warden turns out to be a prisoner, which doesn't line up with the Shawshank thing.
But maybe we've always been doing more of a Prison Break, the show.
Gah!
What are you doing in my car?
Take me with you.
Teach me what you know.
What in the cat's cradle is happening?
Dad hates me.
What do you care what that guy thinks?
He's a dick.
See?
That's what I need to learn.
How to be all dead inside with muscles on top, not all emotional and flabby.
Yeah, but you are emotional.
If you pretend you're not, you're letting him off the hook for being terrible, which he is and always has been.
I mean, he meant the world to you, and you meant nothing to him, and if you run away now, he'll never know.
He should know.
Britta's the worst.
Ow!
Jeez!
Oh.
I thought you guys left.
We started as your buffer, but we're busting you out of here now.
I drew a map of your house on my stomach.
Uh, I know what my house looks like.
That's what I said.
If we act fast, we can get through this plan to put you in the trash can, take you out like trash.
But we gotta dress you like a baby.
Thank you for doing this, but I'm not going.
Those people up there, they may be rude, pushy.
They may have come to wrongheaded conclusions about Batman and Robin.
Oh.
Thank you.
But they're my family.
Family means putting up with each other even when it's hard.
You guys can go.
I'll be fine.
Actually, we're gonna stay.
Oh.
Yeah.
Family sticks it out.
That's ni-- Okay, full disclosure.
We're hiding out from that crazy white guy.
You came back.
I'm sorry.
You should take some credit for who I've become.
Okay.
So let me tell you how I turned out just so you're crystal clear on your impact.
I am not well-adjusted.
More often than not, I am barely keeping it together.
I'm constantly texting, and there's no one at the other end.
I'm just a grown man who can't even look his own friends in the eye for too long because I'm afraid that they'll see that I am broken.
So you get credit for that.
Oh, come on, now-- One time, when I was in seventh grade, I told everybody at school that I had appendicitis.
I wanted someone to worry about me.
But when Beth Brannon asked to see the scar, I didn't wanna get found out, so I took Mom's scissors, and I made one.
It hurt like hell, but it was worth it, because I got 17 cards.
And I still keep them in a box underneath my bed 22 years later because it proves that someone, at some point, cared about me.
You wanna see the scar?
So you get credit for that too.
This is me.
Look, Jeff, I, uh Daddy!
Are you faking a heart attack?
Kind of a Hail Mary.
Happy Thanksgiving, Dad.
Look, you're probably feeling a very strong urge to sleep with me right now, and that is normal.
Yeah.
Britta, thank you.
You were right.
You're not gonna get all Jock Jams on me, are you?
No, of course not.
I left my boom box at school.
Jeez.
You gotta stop doing that.
Thank you.
Come here, brother.
Come here, brother.
Wow.
Why don't you save some for Christmas, buddy?
And then Pierce did whiteface over blackface.
No one was amused.
It's meta.
Abed gets it.
So, Troy, how was your first real Thanksgiving?
No offense to Shirley, but I don't see what the fuss is about.
Thanksgivings the war-- Oh.
I heard your Thanksgiving wasn't much better than mine.
So I thought we could take some time and be grateful for our real family.
The one we chose.
Jeffrey.
Sit, sit, sit.
Jeffrey.
Sit, sit, sit.
We never got to do a Shawshank homage.
Not the way I wanted to.
Maybe the hardest prisons to break out of are the ones without locks.
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
After that day, Jeff seemed like a man unburdened.
He told me about seeing his father, about how leaving there felt like breaking free of an emotional prison he'd been in.
Something about shackles on his heart.
To be honest, I stopped listening.
I was thinking about Christmas.
I hope we do Die Hard.
I hope it's in a restaurant.
I hope it lays out as cleanly as it does in my dreams.
I hope it's cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone, including you, dean.
Hey.
Hmm.
Oh I my' I'll have to remember this for next year.
Heh, heh.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
My name is Kevin.
Or so they tell me.
Actually, they told me my birth name is Benjamin Chang, but I can't remember anything before six months ago.
But by using a special shiny glass called a mirror, I've estimated that I'm 15 years old, although I have no way of knowing.
Changnesia is a fascinating and extremely rare disease on the forefront of the psychological landscape.
Compared with your garden-variety amnesia, Changnesia is immeasurably more complex.
Its varied and seemingly random symptoms, its resistance to both traditional and new age medicine.
Why Changnesia affects the memory but not the ability to make forced puns.
These are all things we can study now that someone has it.
I first met Chang when I hired him as a Spanish teacher at Greendale.
Then he became a disgraced student, a psychopathic music major, a homeless vent dweller, security guard, keytarist, power-hungry warlord, and now Kevin.
Heh-heh.
It's sad to see him like this.
Well, it's mixed.
He was pretty terrible before.
I'm developing a theory which some find controversial.
Perhaps Chang actually used to be Kevin, went crazy, and became Chang.
And then at some point, Chang hit his head, went un-crazy, thereby reverting back to regular old Kevin again.
That makes no sense.
Science tells us hitting his head would only cure him if hitting his head was the original cause.
I told you it was controversial.
Here at Greendale, we accept all students, whoever they may be or have forgotten they were.
But assisting in Kevin's recovery has put a financial strain on the school.
That's why we are appealing to the MacGuffin Neurological Institute for this $40,000 grant so we can continue to fight this terrible disease and hopefully, one day, pay for this documentary.
Heh-heh.
How was that, Abed?
It's too baggy?
No, that was great.
But I could use a new camera with a smoother zoom.
Okay.
Just be sure to get my good side.
This documentary needs to be convincing.
This needs to be the Hoop Dreams of things people care about.
We rolling?
Dean wants propaganda, but I intend to explore all sides of this serious issue, including those who don't think it's a serious issue.
Hey, Jeff.
What are you doing?
A documentary on Changnesia.
You gotta be ******* kidding me.
Got it.
Beautiful.
All right, let's get one more for safety.
Jeff, back to one.
Jeff?
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said It can be here We could be roped up, tied up Dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one They all just fade away I'm telling you, we should have sprung for the name-brand glitter.
Look, cheap glitter, expensive glitter.
Money talks, people.
Guys, did you hear?
The History of Ice Cream class had another heart attack.
Three more and we're all in.
Yes.
What's the MacGuffin Institute?
Fine.
I'll tell him.
But one day, you'll all be old and slow and lose at things, and when that day comes, I won't remember what I'm doing now.
The MacGuffin Institute is coming to Greendale because they might give the school money to study Changnesia.
Changnesia isn't a disease.
It's a con.
You're seriously helping this lunatic?
He kept the dean in a dungeon.
He tried to kill us.
He ate his twin in utero.
That was Chang.
This is Kevin.
They're the same idiot.
How would you know?
Have you ever spent time with him?
I was reluctant to accept Kevin at first too, but he's just so sweet.
The world is brand-new to him.
He approaches everything with the wonder of a child or cartoon alien.
Whoa.
This makes things smaller.
Oh-- No, bigger.
Oh, bigger.
Well, enjoy your collective delusion.
I'm gonna go get a sandwich, which, unlike Changnesia, is real.
Jeff, wait.
We wanna know how you feel about the MacGuffin people visiting.
It's stupid.
What?
The whole thing.
Put it together.
All right.
Thanks, buddy.
I'll cut it together.
Shirley.
Mm?
You don't seriously think Chang is Kevin?
I believe the Lord made Chang, Chang.
Kevin is a choice.
I'm worried about the group.
Not only have they drunk the Kevin Kool-Aid, they're in the study room, making banners, debating glitter.
I'd love to talk but I gotta get to work.
No, Shirley, you've got to help me stop this.
You're the only sane person left.
Welcome to Shirley's Sandwiches, where the food is Kevin-Iy.
You hired Chang?
Hm?
The customers love Kevin.
It's because he's a good listener.
Most words are new to him, so it's still fascinating.
I'm Kevin.
And you are?
Not calling you Kevin.
Hi, Not-Calling-You-Kevin.
What are you having?
None of this.
Okay.
Listen.
I don't care what he calls himself, he's a hard worker.
We're all broken people, Jeffrey.
We all deserve a second chance.
Like I gave Andre a second chance.
Doesn't mean I forgot.
I just forgave.
Chang didn't sleep with a stripper.
He tried to kill us.
Why does everyone forget that?
But he didn't.
And you used to be a sleazy lawyer.
What if Greendale never gave you a second chance?
What Shirley said really made me think.
I mean, all my friends believe this guy.
What does it say about me that I don't?
Yes?
Ugh.
And cue Wet Blanket Winger to tell us that we're all wasting our time.
Actually, no.
I had a really good conversation with Shirley, and I realized I've been acting like a jerk.
If it's not too late, I'd love to help out in any way I can.
Jeffrey, that's amazing.
I knew you'd come around.
Abed, get us in panning singles.
Can you say "powwow" instead of "conversation"?
It sounds more you.
Action.
You gonna make an entrance?
Great.
What does it say?
It says I have gullible friends who will believe anybody, and I need to make that anybody me, by exposing Chang in front of the whole school.
Wow.
Much like the classic documentary Capturing the Friedmans, my story took a completely unexpected turn.
Jeff, if you want this done right, I need a Steadicam for Garrett.
That's showbiz.
Oh!
We were happy when Jeff came around.
He became really gung ho about Abed's documentary and had ideas about how to impress the MacGuffin people.
And that's why Pierce should host the reception.
He speaks their language.
Finally, somebody's making some sense.
I've got a blackface Sefior Wences bit I've been workshopping.
Perfect.
Annie, we need to find out what happened to Kevin before he showed up at Greendale.
What hellish experiences did he overcome during those months?
You think you can use your forensic know-how to do some investigating?
Investigating?
Obvi.
Can I help?
If you're willing to learn, sure, partner.
Partner.
I like that.
I'm gonna call you Houlihan.
Partner and Houlihan.
Okay.
The postman found Kevin here.
He said he was soaking wet and smelled like fish.
I know it's not a lot to go on-- Um-- It's almost too much to go on.
Look, Sullivan's Trout Farm is just quarter-mile away.
Who do you think you're dealing with?
I don't know.
Seems thin.
In an investigation, one dude always has to go opposite the other dude.
That's how they get things done.
You guys work it out.
Yeah, we will.
No, we won't.
Britta, Shirley.
That's me.
I want you to take this camera and follow Chang around for his day-to-day.
Really get into the life of a functioning Changnesiac.
I want you to go inside his home, work, pod.
Just get everything.
That's great advertising for my growing business.
Okay, I'll do it.
And with my photography skills-- Jeff, thank you.
When the dean told me you were gonna help me, I couldn't believe it.
A cool, smart lawyer like yourself reaching out to a little nobody like me?
I never told you I was a lawyer.
No, you didn't.
Shirley said it, remember?
You said, "You hired Chang"?
I said, "Kevin.
You are"?
"Not calling you Kevin".
"Hi.
What are you having"?
You said, "None of this".
Shirley said, "I don't care what he calls himself.
He's a hard worker.
We all deserve a second chance.
Like I gave Andre a second chance.
Doesn't mean I forgot.
I just forgave".
You said, "Chang didn't sleep with a stripper.
He tried to kill us.
Why does everyone forget that"?
And then Shirley said, "But he didn't.
And you used to be a sleazy lawyer".
Her words.
Wow.
That's quite a memory you have.
My short-term memory has actually improved.
My doctor calls it a, um side effect.
Oh.
Well played, Chang.
The chess match has begun.
What-- ?
I'm Chinese?
Do you wanna get footage while we wait for Kevin?
Maybe we could take shots of my delicious bread baking or the affordable prices on our new Shirley's Sandwiches Super Saver Menu.
Or we could get to know the Shirley behind the sandwiches.
Give me that camera.
Okay.
Be careful.
It's Abed's camera.
All right.
Watch it.
Where is the stop button on this?
Oh, here it is.
Okay.
You wanna hear my pitch?
A strong, independent woman, starting her own business.
An entrepreneu-her, if you will.
Or maybe a businesswoman?
Okay, fine.
Think inside the box.
All right.
Are you ready?
Action.
Mm-hm.
Cut.
Oh.
Beautiful.
You think the song was too much?
Are you kidding me?
It made the scene.
I wanna get some better lighting up in this noise.
Let's go hit up Abed.
I never told anybody that story, Britta.
Oh.
It was beautiful.
I was dead for three minutes.
Three minutes?
Three minutes.
They thought I was gone.
Pierce, how's your act coming?
Blackface Sefior Wences?
Mm-hm.
How do you think it's coming?
Ha-ha-ha.
In the unlikely event I fail to expose Chang, I'm confident Pierce will make sure we don't get a grant.
What you talking about, honky?
Wow.
That bit could not get any more perfect.
Wait a minute.
I haven't introduced you to my Asian wife yet.
Oh-ho.
I was wrong.
This is the place.
No, it's not.
Garrett, here he comes.
Get up.
I can't.
It's too heavy.
Garrett, now.
Now.
Excuse me, Mr. Sullivan.
This is Houlihan.
I'm her partner, Partner.
Wait, I'm Partner.
No, you're not.
We'd like to ask a couple questions.
What are you, trout police?
If you are, you're legally bound to tell me or it's entrapment.
We're not the trout police.
Have you seen this man?
I see something coming out of the trout tank, and at first I was scared because I'm the last face that a lot of trout ever see.
I'm not saying that the trout are a vengeful breed, but if they were, I'd probably be public enemy number one.
Heh-heh.
So the figure that emerged, it was that man?
Yeah.
I was relieved when I found out it was a naked Asian guy, and not an angry trout.
And when was this?
It must have been around June.
I remember because my milkweed allergies were acting up something fierce.
I gave him some clothes, sent him on his way next morning.
I don't know what happened to him.
Mr. Sullivan, how many employees do you have here?
Employees?
Heh.
What do I look like, TroutWorld?
Ha-ha-ha.
No employees.
Just me and my dog.
I knew he was hiding something.
A spike in production in June at the peak of milkweed allergy season?
Something on this trout farm was starting to smell wrong.
The problem was I didn't have any way to make him talk.
Or did I?
Well, looks like everything checks out here.
Right, Troy?
No, Houlihan, I don't think anything checks out here.
No, don't fly off the handle, Partner.
Oh, I will fly off the handle, Houlihan.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
Clearly, you have nothing to hide.
What are you hiding?
Fine.
You got me.
I'd been using that Asian guy as unpaid labor for three months before I drove him into town.
But he wanted me to!
We were friends and I treated him with respect and dignity.
Partner and Houlihan.
Shut up, Kevin!
Partner and Houlihan.
I don't understand.
Why work for no money?
He doesn't know about money, labor laws or 40-hour work weeks or that that dude named him after a dog.
I had a cat named Troy, a bird named Troy and a hamster named Troy.
They were all older than me.
Oh, my God.
I think Kevin's struggle just got a lot sexier, grant-wise.
This is horrible.
It was horrible.
They were supposed to come back with a smoking gun.
All they found was a little human rights abuse.
Which, normally, is terrible.
So do you believe Kevin now?
No.
I want all your footage.
I know Chang slipped up.
He's not smart enough to play dumb all the time.
Shirley and Britta's footage?
It's unusable crap.
I don't care.
I want it all.
Bad enough to rent a crane and license an expensive song?
Yeah.
Whatever.
Itsy-bitsy spider Went up the water spout "Unusable crap" is generous.
It goes on for 12 hours.
I couldn't even get through it all and I sat through The Tree of Life.
Wait, right there.
What's that?
Oh, come on, you slippery snake, slip up.
Doubtful.
When alone, he just practices smiling and frowning.
We've all done it.
Who's he calling?
Good question.
We figure that out, we've got our smoking gun.
And all thanks to Britta.
Don't ruin this.
Stage was set for a climatic final set piece.
MacGuffin people were on campus.
Jeff prepared quite the presentation.
And I didn't urinate on a-- You shut up.
But I love you.
You get in the kitchen, make me a burrito.
Oh, okay.
Oh, thank you.
Ha-ha-ha.
Okay, thank you, Pierce Hawthorne, for your special blend of playful racial humor and genuine thoughts on Geraldine Ferraro.
He's an old teddy bear.
And now, I believe, Jeff Winger has a presentation.
Yay.
Thank you.
I must confess I was, just a short while ago, quite skeptical about Changnesia.
With the help of my friends, we have uncovered a lot about this terrible, newly discovered, completely real disease.
I think you'll find it as eye-opening as I did.
Wait till you see what we found.
Kevin was a victim of human trafficking.
Our purpose here tonight is to help cure Kevin of his Changnesia.
Who better to jog his memory than someone special from his allegedly erased past.
So please welcome to the stage the former Mrs. Ben Chang, Alessandra.
Alessandra, come on up.
Thank you.
Ben, do you remember me?
I'm sorry.
I don't.
Admit it, Kevin.
You remember her.
This is the woman you never stopped loving.
Hit the lights!
Oh.
You love her so much, you called her over and over and over again though you don't know her or how to use a phone or what a number is.
Oh.
What's going on here?
You told me I was here to help him.
Oh, we are here to help him, all right.
We are here to help him admit that he has been faking this whole time.
Where'd you get the number, Chang?
I found it in the vents.
It's 555-0190.
And it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
But I always hung up because I didn't know if the person on the other end would ever want to talk to Kevin after knowing Chang.
You seem so nice.
If we were really married, I wish I could remember for even one moment how lucky I was.
Aw.
Oh, Ben.
Jeffrey, what are you doing?
If he doesn't remember her, then this wouldn't bother him.
My logic is flawless.
Doesn't that bother you?
That bothers you.
Things got so ugly, I hesitate to show you this footage.
I will let you see me reacting to it.
That'll probably be more than you can handle.
Actually, it's not that bad but this keeps the story moving.
Hey, Alessandra, his last girlfriend was a charred mannequin leg!
Jeffrey, have you lost your mind?
You never believed Kevin?
You were lying to manipulate us into helping you hurt him?
Jeffrey, I trusted you, believed in you, fantasized about celebrating over mimosas with you.
If this is the sort of battle you're facing in the fight against Changnesia, then you're gonna need all the help you can get.
On behalf of the MacGuffin Neurological Institute, grant granted.
Granted?
That's nice.
Partner and Houlihan.
Jeffrey.
So I guess I did help.
Just not in the way I wanted to.
But on the bright side, this is the most well-documented failure of my life.
Thank you.
I know.
By trying to make Kevin a pariah, I accidentally became more Chang than Chang at his Changiest.
Ha-ha-ha.
That's funny.
Well, I didn't try to kill anyone.
Which no one seems to care about, but you know what I'm saying.
Can I sit here?
You sure you wanna be seen with me?
You have a brand-new reputation to uphold.
H Hfik@ yam, Even after everything I did to whoever you are?
Okay, I get it.
Changnesia's hard to understand.
At least, that's what people tell me.
I don't know a thing about it, which, apparently, is one of the symptoms, and it's so frustrating.
Look, I know Chang was a bad guy.
So he probably deserved everything you did to him.
But you're not a bad guy, you just made a mistake.
And I'm willing to start over fresh if you are.
Hi.
My name's Kevin.
I'm not saying I believe him, but I have gotten an idea of what it feels like to be Chang.
Wanting to leave that name behind is the sanest decision anyone can make.
Hi.
I'm Jeff.
But when the night is falling You cannot find a friend Aww.
Thanks.
A lot of filmmakers use crane shots to elicit emotion.
What the heck, Abed?
You knew what Jeffrey was planning the whole time?
Why can't you make a documentary about the thing you plan to?
Don't censor him.
Censorship.
This is the documentary.
Ugh.
Abed, you gotta teach me how to use that camera.
Pew.
Guys, I'm sorry.
I really screwed up.
I hope you can forgive me.
Already forgotten.
Kevin.
What we laughing about?
Oh, Kevin.
Kevin.
Adorable.
Good job.
I don't get it.
Hi, it's me.
They all finally bought it.
Hook, line and Winger.
I patiently await your further instructions.
Chang out.
Why did I do that?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
His name is Archie DeCoste.
Age: 22.
Total years spent in high school: seven.
SAT score: zero.
And he was recently arrested for selling marijuana to a police officer at a police station.
So you want us to help you recruit this idiot instead of an honors student or a science genius?
Do we go to the same Greendale?
Ah.
But let me reveal the fortune inside this cookie.
Family net worth: $8 million.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what we in the community college recruiting game call a whale.
The perfect mix of low intellect, high lack of ambition and limitless parental support.
So a rich dumb-dumb who will never graduate and keep dropping money into the school.
Got it.
Is there much money in this, or is it like that endorsement deal you made with Let's Potato Chips?
If you don't like the crispy-Iicious taste of Let's, feel free to eat that other greasy brand.
Splingles?
Not this guy.
Thank you, Troy.
And I will explain the value of this whale by describing one who's been swimming right under your nose.
Pierce Hawthorne has taken 8O percent of Greendale's classes more than twice.
He is the only Greendale student who has ever paid for a premium locker or the extended pencil warranty.
Pierce cannot know about this, okay?
He's a big baby who throws tantrums when anyone else gets attention.
Remember when Kerri Strug visited our campus?
That was horrible.
I have scheduled Archie's visit for tomorrow when Pierce has no classes.
Guys, I'm asking, as treasurer of the Forensics Club.
The dean said we could use whale money for a new body farm.
Mmm.
Who wants to help?
I'm in.
Sounds like a romper.
We do need money.
The Biology Department has been dissecting the same dead pig for 10 years.
If we land this kid, we can buy a hundred dead pigs and make everybody happy.
I'll help, but I started a new PE class.
I've been avoiding it, but you can't run from running forever.
I'm in PE too.
I made room in my trophy case.
Then I remembered classes don't give out trophies, so I put a fishbowl there instead.
It's been quite the week.
So the rest of us will have to pick up the slack and, yes, Jeffrey, I assume you're out because of your track record of literally being too cool for school.
Actually, you can count me in on this one.
What?
You had me at "no Pierce".
He's been all over me lately to hang out.
It's weird.
You just want to be a part of something.
Admit it, Thanksgiving softened that Winger underbelly.
Ugh.
Britta.
Now, let's set sail and hunt that whale.
Yeah.
Hey, let's do this.
Oh!
You know what the commercial says.
"Keep your damn hands off my Let's".
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said It can be here We could be roped up, tied up Dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one They all just fade away Hey, Jeff, there you are.
I was thinking we could swing by this great barbershop I know.
You're looking a little stubbly and nobody handles a razor like an Italian.
They develop nimble fingers from pleasing their mistresses.
Thank you for opening my eyes to two new stereotypes.
Now, how can I put this?
No, I don't want to go.
Not now, not ever.
No.
No prob.
We'll work around your skedge.
Ah.
Okay.
Pierce is gone.
Yes.
Walking Dead has left.
Resume Operation Deadliest Catch.
Archie is gonna love this banner.
The name-brand glitter really shows.
Yo, yo, yo!
School board guys in the hizzy.
Richie.
Richie, pace yourself.
Hey, there, dean.
Just thought we'd pop in and check on the big whale hunt.
Ah.
What a day we have planned for young Archie.
Library tour, calculator lab demonstration-- And it all culminates in the Spirit of Greendale reception.
Magnitude is a soft yes.
Oh, wow.
That's a get.
As much as we love that Magnitude, your tour may be lacking a little Tour sucks, bro.
What?
You gotta think big.
Hookers, blow, hookers.
Oh, my.
He's been mixing.
But there is some wisdom there.
We need this whale money.
The kid likes snowboarding.
Maybe Shaun White finds his way on the faculty roster.
He likes to party.
Maybe Greendale suddenly has a frat.
The Delta Cubes or whatever.
You're not considering this, are you?
No.
Greendale stands on its own.
No hookers, no blow, no Shaun White frat.
College dean threatening a fraternity.
You'll never shut down the Delta Cubes.
What?
Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes Look, it's your call, Craig.
Don't let this whale swim away.
Cruise by Skeeper's Express for a refill?
I'll second that motion.
Been working on victory dances.
Basketball, Ha-ha-ha.
Football and crab soccer.
That one's the hard one.
Oh, that's nice.
Um Hey, when I was in grade school, PE was about being picked on and picked last, but you'll put me on your team, right?
Right.
But also wrong.
PE is about survival of the fittest.
Line up, class.
Welcome to PEE.
I'm Coach Jason Chapman.
Physical Education Education?
Thought that was a typo in the course "cartalog".
It started as a typo, but it's grown into one of Greendale's most successful programs.
Anyone can take PE.
I teach my student coaches to teach PE.
Something funny, Coach Barnes?
No, it's just-- You're teaching us how to be gym teachers.
Gym teachers?
A gym is a building, a man-made structure inside which physical education teachers teach physical education to physical education students.
Pop quiz, Coach Barnes.
A student is choking on a plastic golf ball.
What do you do'?
How many cones does it take to line a soccer field?
What if students are talking during stretches?
When my kids talk past bedtime, I use my angry voice and I say: "The next peep I hear will be the last".
And I give them one of these.
Not bad, Coach Bennett.
Heh, heh.
Look at me.
I see you.
Two hours late?
It's the lack of follow-through that makes Archie so appealing, but still send a text, right?
Okay, Abed, I told you we're not doing the fraternity idea.
Delta Cubes will never die.
We've only just begun to fight.
You only began yesterday.
Whale, ho.
Look alive, everyone.
What are you guys all doing out here?
Oh, no.
Pierce will ruin everything.
What's an Archie?
Why does he get a banner?
Jeff, do something.
Oh.
AW Ugh.
There you are, Pierce.
Thought you were gonna cancel our plans.
Plans?
To spend the entire day together away from everyone else.
Oh, yeah.
Those plans.
Ha.
Suck it, bozos.
You're getting ditched by the cool kids.
Oh, what a day we're gonna have.
Text me the instant I can ditch him.
Oh!
Hey, guys.
Sweet campus.
Welcome to Greendale.
I'm Bean Pelton.
"Bean" Pelton?
Dean Pelton.
Ha, ha.
Gosh, I'm nervous.
Please enroll in our school, please, please.
Nice scooter, Archie.
City College gave it to me as a present.
City College?
City College bought you a Vespa?
Brand-new.
So, Archie, have you heard about our Half-Pipes and Hash Pipes class?
Taught by Professor Shaun White.
What?
Yeah.
Let me tell you about it in our Mountain Dew Cool Zone Tent.
Put up a tent, write "Mountain Dew" on it.
Here we go.
Let's keep going.
This is our library.
Okay.
Archie, why don't you hang 10 on the web while I talk business.
And you know what?
You can take that computer.
Whoa!
Sweet.
I can drop it off an overpass.
Ah.
I shouldn't have heard that.
Dean, you're giving him our computers?
Because he is a 22-year-old stonerhead whose parents bought him a GED.
Which college is he going to choose?
Vespa State or, ooh, Look at our Library University?
Those school board guys were right.
Britta, where do we get drugs?
Really?
Look who stumbled onto the high road.
This is a slippery slope.
City College slipped that slope when they slipped him that scooter.
But they sure slipped up when they let him set foot on our soil.
Three, two, one.
Time!
Coach Barnes, it seems dodge ball storage isn't quite in your skill set, much like table tennis prep.
Ha-ha-ha.
Excellent job, Coach Bennett.
Oh.
You have the spatial reasoning skills of a young Kevin Miller, a really good PE teacher I know.
Oh.
The skill of ranking others in order of ability is crucial.
In this next drill, our two best student coaches will split the rest of the class.
Coach Bennett, Coach Neil.
Yeah.
Pick your teams.
Coach Donovan.
Coach Goldman.
Coach McKenna.
Coach Cutler.
Coach Winston.
Ooh, Coach Dornetto.
Coach Guest.
Coach Panos.
Oh.
Choose wisely.
You're one decision away from victory or defeat.
Coach Marzec.
Well picked, Coach Bennett.
Your team wins.
We won!
Nice.
Ah, the barbershop.
A reminder of a bygone era when men were men and women were sex cooks who did laundry.
I've been getting a shave here for decades.
And, apparently, reading the same eight magazines the entire time.
Yeah, National Geographids got some tribal boob shots that are exquisite.
There's something about a breast that's never been touched by white hands.
You are a complicated man.
Silvio, spin up lucky number seven.
You know what?
That feels good, I'll give you that.
Now that soda goblet gets you free refills in the cafeteria and it was painted by our Professor Ed Hardy.
Ha, ha.
Who teaches bikini class.
Oh, yeah!
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa!
Check out that bling.
I want that.
You heard him, Annie.
Bling the king.
Just take it off of him.
There you go.
Thank you.
Delta Cubes, prepare to bond through embarrassment.
Pacifiers in.
Commence-- Code Dean!
Code Dean!
Gosh dean it, Abed.
I told you, no fraternities!
There's soda all over my kicks.
Britta, give Archie your scarf so he can dry his kicks.
Dry his kicks.
Put your back into it.
No.
Line drawn.
If I wanted to wait on a rich man hand and foot, I would've gone to Dubai with that sheik I met at Trader Joe's.
Don't worry about her, Archie.
Heh-heh-heh.
Onward to the microbrew pizzatorium.
I think all a man needs in life is a close shave, a cold beer and, you know, maybe a faithful dog.
Hm.
I had a chocolate lab growing up.
Rosie.
She used to wake me up every morning by licking my feet.
Mine was Walter, a German shepherd.
Followed me to school every day.
I'd look out the window and there he was, dropping a steaming fat one on the lawn.
Would someone please tell me why I've been shaving my own face all these years like a sucker?
Ha-ha-ha.
This state-of-the-art mock locker room or "mocker room," simulates conditions of an actual locker room.
Don't we have an actual locker room?
You think you're ready for that, Coach Barnes?
For our next drill, drama students will play the role of PE students and you will oversee them in a mocker room setting.
My character just had her first period.
Mine has eczema.
Coach Bennett, care to go first?
Yes.
Keep your hands to yourself!
Running will get you five laps, mister.
Joey!
I will come in that shower and kick your bare ass!
Sorry, Coach Bennett.
I have never seen such natural disciplinary skills.
You're up next, Coach Barnes.
Entertain us with your ineptitude.
How's the foam machine coming, Leonard?
Memories will be made tonight.
Destiny.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Oh, I did get your Christmas card.
No.
So-- No, no.
No time to pre-party.
You and the girls get in position and wait for my signal.
Strippers?
Huh?
Oh, tons.
It's good for the school.
The whale is here.
Balloon drop, go.
There you go.
Release the whores.
Oh, yeah.
No way!
Pierce.
I was wrong about this shop.
it really is special.
Well, if you like the place so much, why don't you gay marry it?
You probably didn't notice, Jeff, but I've been trying to get us some alone time.
I might have picked up on that.
I'm no stranger to father issues.
I know confronting your dad couldn't have been easy.
And I just wanna say I'm proud of you.
Well if you're so proud, why don't you gay marry me?
You guys, behave!
Hit the showers!
Everybody in the showers!
Please, stop hitting each other!
Hit the showers!
Cut!
Scene!
Shirley, help.
I can't control these drama students or their characters.
No!
No!
PE is survival of the fittest, Troy.
Hey, your phone's buzzing.
Ooh.
It's from Annie.
You sly dog.
"Need more time.
Keep Pierce busy".
Keep me busy?
Look, the group is giving some big shot a tour, so it's my job to keep you busy.
You know how you get jealous.
So that's why you spent the day with me?
You drew the short straw.
Well, that's how it started, but I really did end up having a good time.
Yeah, I used to regret not having a son to bring here.
I'm glad I didn't have kids.
They just end up disappointing you.
So, Archie, having a good time?
Getting cray up in this club?
Sicker than ever, bro.
I've made my decision, dean.
I'm about to get all up in this Greendale.
Ha, ha.
Whoo!
Human Beings, it's official.
Say hello to our newest Greendalian, Archie DeCoste!
Pop, pop!
Pop, pop!
I want that to be my thing now.
I don't think you can do that.
Magnitude, you're not to say "pop, pop" ever again.
Not pop?
That's right.
Find a new thing.
Get him out of here.
Ah!
Here we go!
We're back!
Get dirty Get dirty Get dirty Get dirty Pop.
POP!
Get dirty, girl Well, we did it.
We did what we had to do and I feel great about it.
It's all for Greendale.
All for Greendale.
You look sad for someone whose Forensics Club can now afford that state-of-the-art body farm.
Mmm.
I can smell the corpses now.
None of this is weighing on you?
Sha!
The only thing weighing on me is tons and tons of whale money.
Jeffrey.
Hey.
Landed a whale, huh?
Yeah, but I'm starting to feel like maybe we-- Archie goes to Greendale now.
Moving forward, Annie.
We all paid a price.
Don't hear Jeffrey grumbling.
And he had to spend a day with Walking Dead.
That's true.
You know what?
I can't believe I'm gonna say this.
Don't talk about Pierce like that.
Look, maybe the only reason he can be so unpleasant is because we expect him to be.
If we don't treat him like such a dick-- Well, he'll still be one but the 2 percent he's tolerable, it might be worth it.
Who put the salt in his cereal, huh?
Heh, heh.
Look, I for one am still proud of what we did for Greendale.
I've been up all night trying out new catchphrases.
Dissity doo?
My God, what have we done?
I thought you dropped PEE.
I did, but I lost my keys in the mocker.
I had to hitchhike home last night in a burrito truck.
It's not as fun as it sounds.
I'm sorry for how I acted in class.
Don't apologize.
You were the fittest.
You survived.
Still, no one deserves to be mocked for being mock-locked in a mock locker.
Friends should help friends survive.
Ah.
Oh, jeez!
Hi.
So I'm gonna help you learn to teach the most unteachable student there is.
Teachers teaching the teach Coaches coaching the coach You gotta dig down deep To prove you want it the most Get your physical education Education There's no room in the gym For hesitation PEE is not PE It's a totally different philosophy It's physical education Education Well done, Coach Barnes.
You as well, Coach Bennett.
You know, I was supposed to teach you two to teach other people, but, instead, you ended up teaching me.
Aw.
I did it.
I used the water fountain.
Archie, wake up.
Chillax, bro.
It's not even noon.
I will neither chill nor relax.
All this hoopla is not what Greendale really is.
Greendale is a nice welcome banner.
Greendale is a foamless cafeteria.
And Greendale is Magnitude saying, "pop, pop-ll Now, I am a man of very little integrity and I let students get away with practically anything on campus.
But I will not allow Greendale to lose the things that make it Greendale.
I would love for you to enroll in my school, but I will not change it for you.
Greendale will stay Greendale, no matter what.
You know what?
Everybody kisses my ass because my dad is loaded.
And they always give me free stuff, like that Jet Ski I sunk.
But it would be pretty sweet to be treated like a normal dude.
Heh.
So I'm in.
Magnitude.
You usually have the perfect blend of brevity and wit that sums up situations like this.
Pop, pop!
Yay!
Oh, that's so good!
So good!
I think we all learned today that all human beings deserve dignity.
Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes!
Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes!
Delta Cubes, Operation Slack Attack!
Slack Attack?
Oh, yeah.
Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes Mark my words, Delta Cubes, you'll pay for this!
frozen ice I've even been to paradise Is this seat taken?
Free country.
Christopher Columbus May have reached You know, I was thinking I might start coming here more often.
I like the vibe.
You know what sport I never got?
Golf.
No argument here.
They lost me immediately with the clown clothes.
You know, I belong to a dozen country clubs.
Never played.
I just hit on the waitresses.
Something about a country-club waitress that just makes you wanna pay your dues every year.
Let's snack it up Let's do it right Let's taste the crisp with the flavored Crunch with all our might Let's grab a bag Let's take a bite Let's grab potato chips Get your damn hand off of my Let's.
Honestly, after all that, you still eat Splingles?
Uh, yeah, Troy.
Splingles have 30 percent less fat.
They're the fit chip.
You know, I kind of have a headache.
Maybe you should go home.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
And then, in the season finale, they reveal the whole thing was a dream when the inspector wakes up next to a very young and very topless Cheryl Tiegs.
Ugh.
Even Pierce loves this show now?
It's not Inspector Spacetime.
It's the American version, and a travesty.
It's obvious, sexist, and the timing is-- Honey, I'm dean.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, Jeffrey, you are too much.
Ha-ha.
Why, I was doing some house cleaning the other day, Deana Reed style, when I realized, gosh, golly, it's been ages since we had a dance.
So this Friday we are going back to Greendale's golden age with an old-fashioned sock hop.
Health Department requires you wear shoes.
What a coinci-dean.
Throwing a dance the same day the CDC is confiscating our drinking fountains.
Well Placating students with a fun event.
Classic bread and circuses.
In Rome, the emperor would distract the populace by allocating money for bread and circuses.
I'm trying to get away from filtering everything through TV.
Time I showed growth.
"It's been three and a half seasons," the old me would've said.
Anyhow, it is a Sadie Hawkins dance, which means girls ask the boys.
Oh, I love those.
So, ladies, get out there and make yourselves useful.
Huh.
So there's one day a year when women are free to choose their own mates?
What is this, cave-person times?
I have already started on a Sadie Hawkins banner, so this is pretty much set in stone.
Then maybe I'll throw my own dance.
One that doesn't conform to your oppressive gender norms.
Give me a break.
You think a dance can just be thrown together willy-hilly?
You think I decide to just do a rainforest theme and buy palm fronds and rig the sprinkler system-- ?
I gotta write this down.
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said It can be here We could be roped up, tied up Dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one They all just fade away So, Britta, you're gonna throw a protest dance?
Is that a thing?
It is now.
And instead of Sadie Hawkins, my dance will honor a real feminist icon, someone who worked for women's rights every day of the year, Sophie B. Hawkins.
You know what, Britta?
You're right.
A Sophie B. Hawkins dance is just what this school needs.
Thanks, Jeff.
To celebrate Sophie B. Hawkins and all her accomplishments.
Jeez, Winger, who's throwing this dance, me or you?
Um, Britta, I think you meant to say Susan B. Anthony, not Sophie B. Hawkins.
Britta for the whoops.
Didn't you have a cat named Susan B. Anthony?
How'd you Britta that?
I didn't Britta anything.
I meant Sophie B. Hawkins.
Really?
Your plan was to throw a dance honoring the singer of "Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover"?
And "As I Lay Me Down," which is the far superior song.
That is a good song.
Yeah.
Yes.
I am throwing a Sophie B. Hawkins dance.
And it is gonna be amazing.
And when people come they're gonna be like: "Damn.
She straight Britta'd this".
Because, that's right, I'm taking it back.
You're really doing this?
As someone who faked being a lawyer for seven years, I appreciate your commitment to the bit, but just admit you were wrong.
So you can say I Britta'd it?
Yes.
That goes without saying.
But come on, it was a small mistake.
Call this off before it becomes a full-scale "Brit-astrophe".
I coined that.
If you don't wanna come to my dance, you are free to go to the Sadie Hawkins dance, which will be happening at the same time across the cafeteria.
Our school has limited venue options.
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.
Oh, and one last thing.
You do realize that if you call it a Sophie B. Hawkins dance, people will expect Sophie B. Hawkins to actually be there, right?
Yes.
And when she comes I'm gonna be like "I Will Remember You" doubting me.
That's a Sarah McLachlan song.
So, Abed, I was thinking about what you said about showing growth, and I was thinking maybe one way to do that is to meet new people and-- Where's this going?
Can I set you up with a date for the dance?
Blind date.
I've always thought of myself as more of an acquired taste, but okay.
If you're open to meeting someone, there's eligible ladies in my church.
Shirley, I'm already finding a date for Abed.
I asked first.
There's no reason we can't both help.
Why don't we each pick a girl and let Abed decide, instead of making it a competition?
That's a competition.
So it is.
Only for the loser.
I need the computer.
There are, like, dozens of computers.
But my e-mail's on this one.
Pierce.
Jeez, what's up your butt?
I may have lied about meaning Sophie B. Hawkins, I didn't want Jeff to make fun.
And then I may have lied to cover that lie, and now I'm in deep lies.
So what?
So you told a lie, big deal.
The important thing is never to admit it.
I was thinking about coming clean.
And give Winger the satisfaction?
Hell, no.
Besides, anything could happen between now and that dance.
An asteroid could hit.
Do you wanna be the schmuck who apologizes just before the world ends?
That kind of makes sense.
Thank you.
Damn right it makes sense.
You're talking to the wisest man on campus.
Now, seriously, I need to get to my e-mail.
The post office is about to close.
Pierce.
Check out my friend Britta's Sophie B. Hawkins dance.
I'll be spinning hits from yesterday and today.
Which are the same since I have Changnesia.
The guy's Teflon.
No matter how much awful he does, he keeps getting another chance.
He's like the Colin Farrell of people.
Wanna help me with Britta's dance?
Could be a chance for classic high jinks.
In the interest of growth, I'm avoiding high jinks.
And capers, romps, and exploits.
Escapades are a gray area.
Ahem, Abed.
This is Kat.
Hi, Kat.
Nice to meet you.
She wants to ask you something.
Isn't she perfect?
She's like one of those quirky girls from the movies.
I saw her in the cafeteria trying to pay for lunch with a song.
I asked if you'd go to the Sadie Hawkins dance with me into the balloon.
Could you hear it?
Sure, I'd be happy to go with you.
Super-duper, Mr. Cooper.
Nice.
So you chose the girl I picked.
It's cool.
It's not like it was a competition or anything.
Just be gentle when you tell Shirley that she was the loser.
Or do you want me to tell her?
It's cool.
I'll handle it.
So was that girl an alien or a toddler with a growing disease?
Hello, Abed.
I talked to a lovely girl at church and she'd be happy to go to the dance.
I appreciate it, but-- I hope you will consider it, and not just because saying no would crush this girl, but because I don't want you to miss the opportunity of a lifetime.
You're right.
I'd love to go to Britta's dance with her.
Oh, good, I'll set it up.
Oh, I hope this doesn't hurt Annie's feelings.
Maybe I should go tell her.
No need.
I'll handle it.
Oh, okay.
Bye-bye.
At the risk of discovering I'm living parallel lives like in Awake, don't you already have a date?
Yep.
Now I have two.
Which means I can do the Mo-dates-in-one-night sitcom trope.
I'll wear two outfits.
Mix up their names.
Hide under a table.
What about growth?
I tried to go in a grounded direction but still ended up in an implausible situation.
Like Shirley said, it's a once-in-lifetime opportunity for high jinks.
I can't pass it up.
You already passed up a great opportunity for high jinks.
I did?
Uh, duh-doy.
Britta's dance?
You think two dates is crazy?
Planning a dance is high jinks city.
Population: high jinks.
Troy, I need your help.
Get some ice.
Wacky ice.
The ice will be wacky.
Looks good, huh?
I'm so excited.
Thank you for the corsage.
Oh, it matches your carnation.
How cute.
I'm glad you like it.
I was afraid you'd think it old-fashioned.
I like old-fashioned.
I find it refreshing.
Speaking of refreshing, I'm gonna get us some punch.
Be right back.
Oh.
Hi, I'm Kevin.
Apparently I'm your DJ tonight.
Uh, I really don't know what I'm doing so if you have a request, please be specific.
I have Changnesia.
Can I help you?
I wanted to try on a different look.
I'm pretty indecisive, so I may be back here a few times, if that's okay.
Cool.
I'm also gonna need to check this Gideons Bible and this jelly-bean kaleidoscope.
Icebreakers.
Hm.
Hey, Britta.
Where's Sophie B.?
She backstage drinking Zima and counting her Beanie Babies?
Sorry, I can't divulge that.
Stars and their privacy, you know.
But she'll definitely be here?
Oh, yeah.
Sophie be coming.
So it just be coincidence that somebody posted a Craigslist ad an hour ago that says, "Looking for Sophie B. Hawkins or convincing Sophie B. Hawkins impersonator to play community college dance tonight.
Very little money".
It's weird how in demand she is.
Good thing we booked her early.
Britta, we're running low on chips.
Here's what I'm thinking.
I go to the Sadie Hawkins dance as the snack inspector doing random spot checks, and confiscate their chips.
All I need is a disguise.
Or you could just go to the supply closet and get some more chips.
Okay, but I still need to use the mustache probably.
Here, in lieu of flowers, I got you this.
It's quirky.
Thanks, governor.
I'll just put it in me invisible sack.
Okay, I'm gonna get us some punch.
Hey.
How are things going with you and Jessica?
Are you two, as they say on TV, making a connection?
Unless that means sex, in which case I hope you're not.
Things are great.
Actually, Jessica did mention she's cold.
Could she borrow your sweater?
The one you wore last week.
I think it's still in your locker.
I guess I could check.
Could you?
That'd be great.
Okay.
Hey, roomie.
What do you think of Kat?
Did she tell you she plays the saw?
I thought she was in a kazoo band?
They need a rhythm section, duh.
Well, keep me posted.
I'm gonna go say hi to Britta.
No, don't.
You have something in your teeth.
A lot.
I do?
What is it?
Can't tell in this light.
But it's there.
You should check it in the bathroom.
The second-floor one.
I will.
Thank you.
You're a good friend.
Hm.
Dance the night away Hello, Jeffrey.
Are you enjoying the sock hop?
A sock hop Britta has all but Britta'd by not Britta'ing her own dance.
Well, the night is young.
Mm.
I'm surprised you let her share the cafeteria.
Oh, I didn't want to.
But once she guaranteed the presence of a certain someone, I couldn't say no.
I wouldn't get your hopes up for Sophie B.-- Oh, it's me.
Hm?
Shall we dance?
Whoop.
You reading the Bible?
No spoilers.
I'm really hoping that things turn around for this Job guy.
So how do I look?
Good.
Except you gotta lose the hat.
It doesn't go with the minister's daughter.
You know what I'm doing.
Yeah.
You're on two dates at once.
I've been watching since you came in.
I'm not good with faces.
Is that a judgmental or happy face?
Heh-heh.
I think it's awesome.
It's one of my favorite bits.
Like when a dog acts embarrassed: Or when a guy chases the girl and does that public declaration of love.
It's not realistic.
Something private into a performance.
I think the dog's trained.
I was talking about the public declaration-- Oh, you're messing with me.
Yes, I was.
This thing's turning out to be tougher than I thought.
Wanna help?
I'd like to, but I still got 1200 pages left of this Bible.
Yes, of course I would.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Tonight's Sadie Hawkins dance is brought to you by Hawthorne Wipes.
For the little lady who knows her place in the kitchen.
And tonight's Sophie B. Hawkins dance is brought to you by Hawthorne Wipes.
Perfect for cleaning the dashboard of your '92 Subaru.
Ah.
Quite a turnout, Britta.
Yep.
Didn't know Sophie B. Hawkins was so big at Greendale.
Oh, yeah.
A large percentage of Greendale students sort of gave up in the mid-'90s, so for many of them, Sophie B. Hawkins is the most recent music they're aware of.
I mean, her coming here is gonna be a huge boost to their spirits.
Great.
Whereas, her not showing up would be enough to push these people to such a dark place and really question whether life is worth living at all.
Okay, bye-bye- So how long have you been doing Bible studies?
I mean, making hats out of duct tape.
Oh, duct-tape hat-- Ah!
You've never seen Star Wars movies?
We're taught popular films are the devil.
If you're talking about Phantom Menace, you were taught right.
Telegram.
Ooh.
Yeah, it's urgent.
Be right back.
Pierce, Sophie B. Hawkins isn't coming.
Everyone's gonna know I'm a liar.
Help me.
Oh, Britta.
Let me tell you a story about a friend of mine that everyone called a liar.
His name was Bernie Madoff.
Pierce, he was a liar.
He stole billions of dollars from his clients.
Has this been confirmed?
Oh, my God.
I Britta'd it.
Bernie?
Oh, hi, Shirley.
Hello, Annie.
Abed seems to be having a good time, which is all that matters.
You're right.
Looks like he made the right choice.
He certainly did.
So we agree.
The best woman won.
She certainly did.
He's on two dates, isn't he?
He certainly is.
This is the most fun I've ever had on a work-study gig.
And I used to run the frozen-yogurt machine before that guy broke it.
Many close calls.
Keep forgetting details, using the wrong names, having to duck behind plants.
Aah!
This night has been perfect.
Oh, what else is on the list?
Oh.
Sorry.
If this were a movie, this would be the part where we kiss.
You're right.
Except we're doing a sitcom trope, so it'd be totally out of place.
Time to go get caught and make a plea to the girl I like.
I'm gonna go with Jessica.
She seems to be the audience favorite.
Okay, bye.
I'd rather die And I knew And I knew Uh-oh.
You thought you'd get away with this?
Let me explain.
What about wanting to grow?
Was that a lie so you could do another world-famous Abed TV adventure?
These are real people you're messing with.
Kat is Hula-Hooping all by herself.
Abed, in the real world, people can actually get hurt.
Message for the party.
Oh.
This is great.
So I got a request for, "You suck at this.
Get off the stage".
Okay, I don't know if that's the band or the song.
Again, apologies.
Changnesia.
Ha-ha.
Well, it blew up in my face in a slightly different way than I planned.
Can I help you?
Where's Rachel?
She said she had to go.
Where?
I don't know.
She seemed upset.
She ran out of here without tagging half this stuff.
I mean, whose water wings are these?
Aah!
Come back here.
Never mind.
My baby loves me I know.
I'm sorry.
I did mean what I said about growth.
But you were both so intent on getting me dates, I couldn't help myself.
It was wrong, and hurtful.
I see that now.
Well, maybe setting you up was a bad idea.
Yeah, I guess neither of our girls were really right for you.
The worst part is I met a girl tonight that I really do like.
I was busy chasing one trope, I missed one under my nose, that the girl I liked all along was under my nose.
I've screwed things up.
I don't know if I can make them right.
Aw-- Wait.
This one's real, right?
Yeah, I'm really sad.
.
Well, go find her, dummy.
Yeah, haven't you ever seen a movie?
Sophie.
Sophie.
Sophie.
Sophie.
Sophie.
Sophie.
I hate to say I told you so, but I'm gonna say it to Britta's face.
Sophie.
Sophie.
Sophie.
What is the nature of hope?
Sophie's not coming, guys.
Boo.
Looks like someone underestimated the time it takes to plan a dance.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's Sophie B. Hawkins.
Good evening.
I'm Sophie B. Hawkins.
I think you know this one.
Oh, man.
That old dog has chained you up All right Give you everything you need To live inside a twisted cage Sleep beside an empty rage Did you do this?
If it's possible to make something happen by willing it, then yes, I did.
Damn, I wish I was your lover I'd rock you till the daylight comes Make sure you are smiling and warm I am everything Tonight I'll be your mother I'll do such things to ease your pain Free your mind And you won't feel ashamed IOh Sorry, Sophie.
I have something to say.
Hey.
Come on, man.
Come on.
There was a girl here tonight.
Her name was Rachel.
I met her, and it was very pleasant.
And I made a mistake.
And now I'd very much like to continue this conversation in private.
Wow, viva lost love.
Damn, I wish I was your lover I'd rock you till the daylight comes You came back.
That was pretty embarrassing.
H had fi@: But I'm glad I did it.
So would you like to go out sometime?
I would like that.
Wanna pretend you're just going outwith me on a bet?
Oh, I'd like that very much.
Mm-hm.
But maybe we should try normal first.
Sure.
Aww.
I prefer "As I Lay Me Down".
Me too.
You come inside myjungle book I can't believe she pulled this off.
I know.
According to dean law, I must now give her my amulet.
What?
Hm?
Well, she had a little help from a wise old man who was the official supplier of moist towelettes to the Lilith Fair between 1997 and 1999.
I knew it.
You're safe.
You did this?
But why?
Because in the face of all logic and reason, Britta didn't back down.
That makes no sense.
Also, I didn't like you being a jerk to her.
She was acting crazy.
Yeah, but what choice did she have?
You make fun of her, you use her name as a synonym for screwing up.
Cut her some slack, Jeff.
She helped you reconcile with your dad.
For Pete's sake, let her be happy.
It felt like springtime On this February morning In the courtyard Birds were singing your praise I know it's probably impossible to read my texts without them sounding sarcastic, but I assure you, this one is as earnest as they come.
Congratulations on an awesome dance.
You Britta 'd the hell out of this thing.
This I pray That you will hold me dear As I lay me down to sleep This I pray That you will hold me dear Though I'm far away I'll whisper your name Into the sky Can you do one where you wish you had ice cream?
Damn I wish I had some ice cream Ah!
So good.
Okay, can you do one where you wish I was Batman?
Fine, but this is the last one.
Okay.
Damn I wish Abed was Batman I love it so much.
So good.
All right, you guys are taking advantage of Ms. B. Hawkins.
But-- But-- But you nothing, she's an artist.
She is not here to do your bidding.
Heh-heh-heh.
Sorry about that.
Now, if you could just sing "Dean, I Wish I Was Your Lover" with these new lyrics.
It's for my voice-mail.
Who's Jeff Winger?
Just sing the damn song.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said It can be here We could be roped up, tied up Dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one They all just fade away Okay, this awkward silence has been going on for days.
Granted, Jeffrey looks amazing when he broods, but this has got to stop.
Now, I don't know what happened, but we have to get to the bottom of this.
It's too embarrassing.
I understand.
You don't wanna talk about it.
And you won't have to.
They will talk for you.
Why did you make, have, and bring these?
Don't answer.
It's puppet therapy.
Mm-hm.
The psychology world has recently embraced it after seeing it on Law & Order.
You'll notice each puppet is made in your likeness.
They were a rush job.
It's not like I had them on hand for personal use.
Heh-heh-heh.
Excuse me.
Let me just grab this thing that's definitely not a whip.
In addition to being adorable, I know firsthand that puppet therapy can and does work.
Uh, dean, puppet Kevin here thinks I should have a candy bar now.
No, you know how it winds you up.
Fine.
We'll split it.
Okay.
Got money, bro?
He's not what he seems.
Wait.
Where's Pierce?
I know he's not with us, but is he still with us?
I'm sure he's fine.
Although no one's seen him since he lost his mind in the woods.
You all were in the woods?
Oh.
Oh, so the puppets are working.
Okay.
Uh Ha-ha.
How did it start?
What happened?
We're not playing with puppets.
Jeffrey.
Dean, what happened is between us and Jesus, and Jesus don't snitch.
I don't need a puppet to express myself.
I say what I want.
But I am a fan of the medium, so My father is withholding.
Mm.
That's interesting.
Guys, are we just gonna avoid making eye contact forever?
Who are we, Jeff during sex?
Let's just give it a shot and move on.
Fine.
If we're gonna play this game, then, unlike sex with Britta, we're gonna do it quickly and with a small shred of dignity.
Eh.
Yeah.
Jeffrey, dignity is my middle name and my first name is Dean-nocchio!
Da-da-da-da!
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
Whoo!
It started on Friday.
Britta was talking about a few of her latest causes.
This one's for Greendale Animal Shelter, this one's global warming, this one's global cooling, just in case.
And this is for the amount of rubber wasted while making stupid bracelets.
That's called rubber flubbing.
It's a real problem.
Open your eyes, people!
Britta said "open your eyes, people".
Square.
Nice.
What are you doing?
Playing Study Group Bingo.
Study Group Bingo?
We've been friends for years.
We've fallen into a repetitive pattern.
Like humorous misunderstandings on Three's Company, or girls gossiping on Gossip Girl.
To liven things up, we made a bingo chart of the predictable things we say.
This game is gay.
Square.
You're mocking us?
That's not a very Christian thing to do.
Square.
Can we get back to studying?
Square.
I don't like this game!
No point.
It's insulting.
Okay, stop.
Square.
Ugh.
Abed's right.
We've had the same conversation a million times.
I guess we're kind of stuck in a-- Rut?
Yes.
But there's not many things you could be stuck in.
Elevators, peat bog.
Bad marriages.
The middle seat.
Time loops.
Bottom of a well.
Emotions.
Quicksand.
Traffic.
Middle of a desert.
Okay, stop!
Square!
How did we get so predictable?
And here is our state-of-the-art-- In 1989.
-- Library, where-- Oh, look.
It is my favorite study group.
They all really typify the diversity we have here at Greendale.
Ruggedly handsome leading man.
Heh-heh-heh.
A mom, an activist, a perfect student, a lifelong learner, a sidekick, and Abed.
Enough.
It's time to move this tour along to meet my good friend, Magnitude.
Yeah, prepare to be pop-popped!
He's a national treasure.
Look, the problem isn't us.
We're awesome.
The problem is Greendale.
It's pulling our strings, and we need a break.
Yeah, our Ferris Bueller needs a day off.
Hey, whose dad has a vintage Ferrari?
Abed, a pop culture reference is more of the same.
We need to go big.
We need an adventure.
That's a good idea, Annie, but there's one problem.
Where would we go?
Where?
Where would we go?
We can go anywhere that you know Could we travel through time?
Or maybe see France?
Or anywhere else Naked ladies will dance Could we fly in a booth?
Could we go to church camp?
I'd rather stay at Greendale Could we ride a hot-air balloon?
Yes!
Now, that's an adventure We should go soon We can go anywhere in a balloon Yes!
That's an adventure We can go high We can see anything up in the sky Yes!
Now, that's an adventure Pierce, bring your dentures We're so thrilled because soon We'll be in a hot-air balloon Ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah Hey, guys.
I'm the balloon guide Before we take off I'm gonna check the balloon ties Look at the burner Check out the basket If you have a question Feel free to ask it Could we go to space?
Could we fly to heaven?
I'd rather fly to Vegas It's getting time to ride the balloon Yes!
Now, this is adventure About to go soon We're gonna go anywhere In the balloon Yes!
This is adventure We're starting to fly We can see everything Here in the sky This is adventure There's beautiful weather Now outside And we're fine As long as we have a balloon guide Oh, no.
Where's the guide?
Guys!
Guys!
Yep.
Oh, boy.
From now on, no more singing in the balloon.
Did I miss it?
Miss what?
Who said anything about a runaway balloon?
Okay, let me process this.
No!
Oh, God.
We're really high.
I'm really scared of heights.
Guys, what are we gonna do?
I had a dream it would end this way.
Oh, Jeffrey.
You were on a runaway balloon?
You could have died.
You could have died.
How could you almost let him die?
We all almost died, but we all didn't.
A near-death experience would've only brought us closer together.
Good point.
It did get pretty hairy after that, especially once Pierce started helping.
Okay, everyone push down with me at the same time.
One, two, three!
Come on, people.
I can't do this alone.
You can't do it at all.
Unh.
Oh, look.
A down string.
Pierce!
No!
If we fly to heaven, please don't tell my grandpa about me and Britta.
Shirley?
We're so high.
This is not good.
There are so many clouds.
It's so dark.
I can't even see The Landing Strip.
Or any of the other nudie bars.
Oh, heaven, help us.
We must be a mile above the ground.
That's international airspace.
We're literally above the law.
Jeff can marry any man he wants.
Wait a second, guys.
I think we're starting to go down.
You see?
Prayer works.
So does gravity, Shirley.
And you know who invented gravity, right?
Guys, let's put a pin in the "mysteries of the universe" convo until we land.
Which will be sooner than we thought.
We're gaining speed fast, people.
Oh!
Brace for impact.
Oh, damn you, gravity!
Damn you, prayer!
Damn you, Vicki!
Has anyone noticed Professor Duncan hasn't been around for a long time?
Maybe I can soften our descent.
He's freakishly strong with his old-man monkey strength!
I can help!
I can help!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, obviously, that was very scary.
Post-traumatic stress is a real issue, but with these puppets giving voice to our feelings, we can begin to heal.
Hey, come on.
This is gonna be along and arduous process.
There's more.
Hey, well, excuse dean for reacting to the natural lull in your story.
I'm so sorry.
When you hurt, I hurt.
What happened next?
We made it.
Everyone okay?
I'm alive.
Square.
Guys, knock it off.
Still alive?
Okay, we're all safe.
We just have to figure out how to get back to Greendale.
But we're in the middle of the woods.
Where do we start?
We split into two groups, the survivors and the others.
Where's the manifest?
Stop with your Lost references.
We need to get back home.
What if we're stuck here?
Start a prison system.
We'll be stranded here forever.
I've never seen Blue Man Group!
Guys, guys, we're gonna make it out of here.
We gotta relax.
We're all gonna be fine.
What is that?
Just wanna say, if we're gonna die, I love you guys.
I love you all too.
I did see Blue Man Group.
I just didn't get it.
Why can't they talk?
They have so much in common!
Others!
Ahem.
Oh.
Heh.
I'm sorry.
Ahem.
I didn't mean to startle anybody.
Heh.
And I thought my hair looked fake.
You guys are a long, long way from Greendale.
How did you know we're from Greendale?
From Pierce's shirt.
How did you know my name is Pierce?
It's embroidered on your Greendale shirt you got at the student store.
How'd you know I got it at the student store?
I'm a touch psychic.
Oh.
I used to go to Greendale just like you guys before I came out here to be free.
So this is how Greendale graduates end up, as transient mountain men.
Ha!
Not as bad as I thought.
But don't you miss having stuff?
Out here, you have everything you need and you can be whoever you want to be.
Huh.
Here in the woods You're totally free You can live off the land And be who you want to be We can be our own men And I don't need an A The perfect-mom pressure Would all go away Greendale is crazy And so is that moose Hi, Troy.
Greendale turns people's screws So loose We're no exception To tell you the truth Which is why the woods is perfect For all of you Being socially conscious Can be really tough Ah, here in the woods You can forget all that stuff I don't like the pressure To always be cool I was gonna say that Now I don't have a rhyme We all try our hardest But the pressure in college Sometimes gets so tremendous That it would be stupendous To be free Far away From Greendale Mm, yummy.
I really love these berries Where are they from?
My hand just made a rainbow And my face Magic Magic Well, these magical berries Put us in a drug sequence They make everything swirly Whoa, that bush sounds like Shirley Now we're free Far away From Greendale Be free, my friends.
From Greendale Be free.
Simply inspiring.
Ten minutes ago, you weren't even speaking.
And now you've admitted that a strange man hand-fed you psychotropic berries.
This is puppet therapy work-- Dean!
There is a fire in the cafeteria.
Garrett, not now!
Ugh.
Ha-ha.
Where was I?
Ha!
I was healing you.
Go on.
Well, those devil berries freed our minds and loosened our tongues.
Your skin is so beautiful and soft.
It's like felt.
Kiss each other.
Wow.
I feel so free out here, like I'm my own man.
If Jeff said we had to live out here, I'd be down with that.
Me too.
Yeah.
Can I tell you guys a secret?
Yeah, sure.
Totally.
Mm-hm.
All right.
I was at the grocery store with my kids, and I thought I saw Andre walk by with another woman.
I love women.
Mmsmmm UUE.
I'm gonna go take a growler.
Anyway, I wanted to follow Andre and the woman, so I left my kids at the magazine stand for just a minute.
But somehow I lost track of time and ended up tailing them all the way out of town.
It wasn't even Andre.
The horrible part is I forgot my kids and left them all night in the grocery store.
Well, there you all go, giving me that look, treating me like Judas, judging me like Judy.
You know, Judge Judy.
She judges people.
Shirley, this is the first I've heard of you leaving your kids in a grocery store.
Me too.
I have no memory of you saying that.
If you don't know my secret, why have we been awkward around each other?
I thought everyone heard my secret.
I didn't hear you say anything.
So nobody else heard my terrible secret about how I Trail off from time to time?
Did everyone here reveal a secret?
Mm-hm.
And no one remembers anyone else's, including mine?
Mm-mm.
Those berries made us real talky but not real listen-y.
So if no one heard or remembers anything anyone else said We're in the clear.
We're in the clear.
We're in the clear!
We're in the clear!
I'm a dean-ius.
Yeah!
We're in the clear!
We're in-- !
Um Guys?
Well, um, don't mind me.
I'm sure you guys can get on with your lives without the worst mom ever.
Sounds good.
Anyone up for a movie?
Abed, sit.
Shirley, you have nothing to be ashamed of.
No one thinks you're a bad mom.
Thanks, Jeff, but I'm-- I'm just gonna go home now.
Shirley, wait.
I think I know how to make you feel a little less horrible.
I like where you're headed.
Who's holding?
I have four berries, but I am saving them for Laser Floyd.
No, we all need to reshare our secrets sober.
Oh, God.
We were all feeling crappy earlier, but we were feeling crappy together.
Shirley is alone now.
This is the only way to put us on equal footing, and if it makes it any easier, we can use these puppets.
Aim W379 Shunt mpâ Okay.
I found the perfect girl for me, and then I met her kid.
I said it didn't bother me But truthfully, it did I promised him I'd make it To a baseball game he had But I bailed and never called again And now I'm just exactly like my dad I am an activist That's always been my choice Truth is I've never voted Except when I watch The Voice I was struggling in history I'm normally the best I let Cornwallis rub my feet To give me all the answers to a test I caused the Greendale Fire of '03 Fifty-five acres went up in a blaze All because I burned an ant hill This secret inside me Was trapped beyond a doubt And now my most terrible Secret's out There you are.
Come on, guys.
I've never slept With the great Eartha Kitt We dry-humped inside Of her tour bus This secret inside me Was trapped beyond a doubt And now my most terrible Secret's out I want to thank you all for being so open and honest and for syncing your mouth and hand movements.
And now for my most terrible secret.
I am not what you would call traditional-- Wait, Abed, you never told us your secret.
Right.
I didn't share one that night.
After we got back, everyone was being silent, not making eye contact.
I didn't know why, so I mirrored your behavior.
Aw.
Mm.
Heh-heh.
Thank you, Jeff.
And I don't think you're anything like your father.
I don't know how you take care of one kid, let alone three.
Oh, that's nice.
So nobody thinks I'm a slutty cheater?
No.
Or me as a criminal?
No.
Nobody respects me any less as a political activist, right?
Well, uh The level to which we respect you as a political activist has definitely not changed.
That's right.
That's how I would say it.
Exactly.
Bye, dean.
Should we grab a bite?
Skeeper's?
Oh, Skeeper's.
College is a party.
Once again, I help fix everyone's problems only to go home alone.
Who says you have to be alone?
Jeffrey.
Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
It's open.
Look at us.
Our group's first grown-up Christmas party.
Thanks for hosting.
I hope you don't mind.
I brought things to make the place look a little less short-term corporate housing.
Well, mi casa es su art project.
Cool.
Figured just a little something there, a little zhuzh right there.
Just a few things to add a little Annie.
Do we have to have another talk about you wanting to play house with me?
Pshaw!
Sha-- Nah-- Not.
I'm just decorating for a party.
I saw these curtains and I couldn't resist.
Let's live with them for a night.
We can return them.
Let's totally return them.
Jeff.
Live with them for one night.
Actually, these will also work for Valentine's Day, President's Day, whenever people get to see it.
Annie, what is this?
Oh!
I know we said no gifts but I couldn't resist.
You realize you've put your friends in an awkward position.
A gift creates obligation.
I don't see it that way.
Well, I do, and I think the others will too.
Merry Christmas.
I know we said no gifts, but I couldn't resist.
Oh.
Who couldn't have seen that coming?
I love what you did with the place.
It's a work in progress.
Good tidings, fellow Christmas celebrators.
And to all a good wassailing.
I know we said no gifts but we couldn't resist.
There's a real problem with resistance in this group.
Hi.
Thank you all so much for inviting me to my first Christmas.
Annie explained to me that "no gifts" means "bring gifts".
I'm getting it.
No means yes.
So this is Christmas.
Just this.
I was hoping we could do Die Hard in a restaurant.
There's a place Nakatomi Sushi.
I hear the Hans grouper is to die for.
It's all spelled out in your e-vites.
I know you opened them.
I brought gifts.
Does Annie live here now?
Mm.
Okay.
Now that we're all here.
Oh, wait.
Where's Pierce?
Oh.
Sensitivity training with Gilbert.
Apparently watching Invictus didn't do the trick.
Okay.
Well, now that we are all here I have some good news and some bad news.
Great.
Black licorice?
I have to start with the bad news.
It's about our history paper.
I heard through back channels we got failing grade.
What?
Kendra told me.
She does work for Professor Cornwallis.
I'll bet she does.
We failed?
This is terrible.
I need that paper to graduate.
Who screwed up their section?
It doesn't matter.
No, it matters to me.
I wanna know who cost me my early graduation.
I didn't do anything wrong.
I worked-- There's no need to point fingers, because I haven't told you the good news.
I invited the professor tonight.
Annie.
How is that better?
No, no, Annie's right.
This could work.
The grade isn't etched in stone.
These British guys like to socialize with their students.
We just need to show him a good time, laugh at his jokes, love whatever he loves, and by the end of the night I bet you we get that grade to a C. Who knows?
Maybe even an A. Or something realistic.
Just like that our holiday party turned into a tense secret mission.
No costumes.
No funny voices.
Aww.
Okay.
But for the purpose of story symmetry, I suggest we wait silently until the professor arrives.
It's the only real plot point we need next.
This is ridic-- Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said It can be here We could be roped up, tied up Dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one They all just fade away Hi!
I'm sorry.
I can't stay long.
I've got my daughter in town.
Didn't want to appear rude.
Was I expected to bring a gift?
No.
Nor was anyone else.
Can I show you around, starting with the bar?
A lovely place.
Very feminine.
Did you hear him use feminine as an insult?
Typical phallo-centric worldview.
I bet he gave us a failing grade because he could tell my section was written by a strong, independent-- Excuse me, I've just seen an old friend.
Hurry back soon.
Hey, Abed, got you an early Christmas gift.
I know you were bummed about not doing Die Hard in a restaurant.
And your recent divorce.
"To Abed, yippee-ki-yay, Father Christmas".
I tried to get you taking off shoes but I didn't know how to wrap it.
John McClane's tank top?
You're getting really good at Christmas, Troy.
It's Macallan 18.
I like to serve it neat if that's okay with you?
What, in America?
Don't you mix it with cherry pop or Monterey Jack cheese?
Professor, these are melon slices with ham.
And asparagus wrapped in salmon.
I see somebody's been attempting tapas.
That would be me.
I think cuisine is like a window into history.
I believe it was the Huns-- Actually, you know, I was talking to the ladies.
Oh.
Ah.
Well, I'll leave you three be, all right?
Britta.
The professor seems to be responding to things that I don't have, so you gotta get in there and jiggle.
He hates me.
He called me Broken Barbie all year.
We're all gonna have to work it if we're gonna get that grade changed.
Be honest.
Your section sucked, right?
No way.
I read an entire book on the Peloponnesian War.
Wow.
You pronounced it right.
Then someone else had to tank it for us to get that F. Someone else?
Can you keep a secret?
Yeah.
I blew my section off.
What?
There was a secret Tom Waits show in town, so I did the math.
There's seven sections to the paper.
Annie gets an A, Pierce buys his from Neil, so that's solid.
Then you guys get Bs and Cs, so I figured if my section gets an F, the worst we could end up with is a C-minus.
You just left your section blank?
Of course not.
I pasted the lyrics to "War, What Is It Good For".
Good God.
Shh.
Your friends were counting on you.
That's their fault.
I have carefully cultivated a persona that screams, "You're on your own".
That's my judgey face.
Noted.
I'll make it right.
I'm going back in.
How's it going?
Well, he asked me to get my fit bum to the kitchen for a refill, so that's good.
Kevin's showing him a card trick.
What?
Oh, God.
Is this a card?
No, it isn't.
Queen of hearts.
No, I'm asking, is this a card?
Hey, Kevin.
Did you know that we have bubble wrap?
What?
Poppy-poppy paper- I so enjoy that.
Do you mind if I pop some?
Oh, go crazy.
Chang-nesia.
I mean, why do you indulge that idiot?
I too was skeptical at first, but now I actually have some sympathy.
I believe it was Tacitus who said-- Mr. Winger, your pathetic attempts to suck up to me are a wee bit transparent.
I can only surmise that it's something to do with the C-minus I gave you.
C- minus?
Thank you.
Is this the-- ?
If you'll excuse us.
He's giving us a C-minus.
Right.
A C-minus is not a failing grade.
To me it is.
I'm on a Valedictorian track, and a C-minus means I fail to get Valedictorian.
You ruined our dinner so you could be crowned the smartest person at the dumbest school?
The only reason I agreed to kiss that pompous Anglo's ass was because I thought we were getting an F. Good news, Mr. Winger.
You may remove your lips from my buttocks because you have in fact succeeded in changing your grade.
It's now an F. What?
You're F-ing us?
Professor, if you could just give us a minute, this has been a terrible misunderstanding and I'm sure we can get this whole thing sorted out.
Bedroom.
Now.
Jeff just got us an F. I thought we had an F. No, we were lied to.
This isn't fun.
That guy's creepy.
If there's a human Scrooge McDuck, this guy's it.
This wouldn't have happened if Jeff hadn't taunted him.
It wouldn't have happened if you hadn't decided a C isn't enough.
When are you gonna realize that grades don't matter outside of school?
That's a lie they tell dumb people when fitting them for work boots.
All we needed was a passing grade and we had it until you dragged us into this mess.
Judgey face.
All right.
I will talk to him man to man and try to get our C-minus back.
It's the best we can do right now.
Let me handle this.
Let go of me, you big, hairy nutter.
I'm proving my worth to you guys.
Do you want me to kill him?
Kevin, bad.
I have Chang-nesia.
I'm not a dog.
Professor, we're so sorry.
Obviously, Kevin made a mistake.
Or did he?
Why are you "Or did he"- ing him?
I'm saying the professor can't get any more tied up, and we can't get less than an F, so let's just take a beat and think this through.
This is way better than Die Hard in a restaurant.
So, what exactly is your plan here, Mr. Winger?
I'm not gonna change your grade, and it'll take several days to starve me, as I really loaded up on that dreadful tapas.
Oh, but you already have changed it, professor.
You dropped it to an F, thereby proving the work on the page is not the only factor you consider.
And now, thanks to Kevin's complete misreading of the situation, we have our moment of maximum leverage, so let's just talk about this F. Maybe it can come up to a C-minus, or who knows, perhaps an A. This is actually a felony.
I mean, I will call the police and you will all go to jail.
Let me explain why you won't do that.
First, he's tied up.
First, you're tied up, and second, who can be sure what happened in this apartment?
Maybe you attacked one of us.
Where are the signs of struggle?
Oh!
You were full of Scotch when things took a dark turn.
We'd all heard about your troubles with co-eds back at Oxford, but it was becoming all too real.
As you lumbered around the room, we had to assume you were coming after me or Britta.
Ahem!
Or Shirley, who I didn't mention earlier, because she intimidates you sexually.
Thank you.
Point being, let's just take the idea of the police off the table, shall we, professor?
You think you can hold this group together without anyone cracking?
Oh, we're solid.
Empires are always destroyed from within.
And I can prove it to you from the comparative comfort of this tacky chair.
I will give an A right now to the first person that unties me.
The rest of you will fail.
This is amazing and possibly all in real time.
Everybody, stop it.
No one listen to him.
The professor's job is to make us turn on one another.
We hold all the cards as long as we stay united.
And, Kevin, you're one of us.
Thank you.
All right.
Who will be the betrayer?
The type-A Lolita, the put-upon housewife?
Is that me?
Or how about you, the odd, emotionless Muslim?
I mean, come on, you don't deserve an F. You know that because of your impairment they'll forgive you anyway.
All true, but I'm probably not your best target.
I'd like to get some popcorn.
It takes a while for villains to ramp up.
Promise not to monologue till I get back?
Give it up, professor.
You got nothing.
Oh, I've got plenty.
Why don't we just let him go?
It's Christmas.
We have gifts.
Don't you see?
We can't.
Someone will get the A. No one wants to screw the group.
You see that?
Your offer actually made it harder for you to get untied, because no one wants to be the betrayer.
Beware the Ides of March, Mr. Winger.
Everyone wants to be the betrayer.
What the hell is your game?
I'm trying to teach you history.
Your failure will be the same as any self-obsessed nation.
You care about each other when you're winning.
The Romans loved Rome when it was raping half the world, but when Hannibal came charging over the Alps, the Romans turned on themselves as quickly as you can say "E Pluribus Unum.
" I'm pretty sure it's anus.
Usually, the cracks are hidden within the alliances.
So let's see.
In any group of seven, there's bound to be some romantic entanglements.
I've noticed that the damaged blonde is dating the childish black one.
I wonder, does anyone take issue with that pairing?
You're fishing.
No one has anything against Britta and Troy dating.
And that's coming from Jeff, and we used to date, so-- Britta, information is ammo.
And what we did was not dating.
Uh!
Ahh!
A little friction.
That usually indicates heat.
Heat?
There's no heat.
If there was heat, I'd be nervous, and if I was nervous, I'd be rambling, and I'm definitely not rambling, there's no heat.
Well, I think we found our triangle.
Thank you, and welcome to the party, Troy.
He knows my name.
Guys, keep it together.
I missed something great, didn't I?
It's time to stop arsing about and get serious.
So let's hear it from the one person who needs that A the most, and can't possibly abide by an F, the one person on pace to become class Valedictorian.
Uh!
I would never turn against the group.
I'm not talking about you.
What?
Abed?
Jeff?
Is it me?
Oh, my God, Britta?
First, of all, it's me.
And second, you put Britta ahead of me?
None taken.
Oh, my God, Shirley.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
I didn't think it was a competition.
Of course, you'd play it that way so I wouldn't be expecting-- A church-going mother of three to be smart, huh?
So, Ms. Edison, it's decision time, isn't it?
Annie, don't listen to him.
You know, you can't make Valedictorian with an F, and you can eliminate your competition in one easy step.
What else do you have to lose, my dear?
These people, they're not here to support you.
I mean, they already hate you for this disaster of a party.
Not this guy.
No.
I can't.
Give it up, professor.
You've fired all your bullets.
No, I've got one more bullet left, and it's a doozy.
Mr. Winger, would you like to tell your friends why they did so poorly on this paper or shall I?
Jeff?
Jeff?
Jeffrey.
I tanked my section.
I knew you guys would all work hard, so I just coasted.
Tom Waits was-- Agh!
You cost me Valedictorian.
He cost me Valedictorian.
That was my punch.
Tom Waits, you guys.
Tom Waits!
Oh, my God.
Jeff, do you have any Milk Duds?
Jeffrey, I know you're in there.
I can smell you.
Did I have the game on too loud?
Everything okay?
I was spending an evening with my two lady friends, Rizzoli and Isles, when I heard-- Wait a minute.
What is going on in here?
No!
I can explain.
No explanation necessary.
Next time you decide to have a party without me, Jeffrey, at least have the decency to do it when I'm in spin class.
I'm a blast at holiday-themed parties.
Where the hell is he?
Professor?
Did he leave?
Why in God's name would I leave?
This is just getting interesting.
Now, one of you untied me.
I wonder who it was.
Who is the Benedict Arnold, the true hero of this story?
Oh, no, what's gonna happen when we find out who betrayed us?
Hm, I wonder why you're so scared.
It wasn't me.
Can we just say a ghost did it again?
We're gonna find out who did it when we get our grade.
No, we'll have to find out now.
Otherwise, the lesson isn't complete.
But the lesson is complete.
You know what you taught us tonight?
That, yes, empires fall, but we're no empire.
We're just a bunch of flawed, selfish people.
And that's not our weakness.
It's our strength.
The one thing we can count on at any given moment, is that the six of us are paying for a mistake made by one of us.
And that means, at any given moment, one of us is screwing up so badly that he or she is gonna forgive whoever screws up next.
Now, I'm gonna do something that Octavian never would.
Yeah, I read the book.
I'm gonna say that whoever untied the professor, I don't give a crap.
Because whoever it was, I know it was some flawed, selfish, weak, hopeless soul like me.
Exactly what the betrayer would say.
Fine, dick.
If it was me, I'm gonna lose my A by tying you up again.
What?
Hey!
That's hurting.
That's hurting.
Now, if you'll excuse us, we have some gifts to open.
Mine first, mine first.
Milady.
Heh.
Kevin, did you wrap these presents yourself?
Once again, I'm not a dog.
Zoink.
Doink.
Kevin, how do you tie a knot?
Really simple.
So you go like this, go.
Make a little rabbit ear like so, then the kids go marching down the well.
Oh, my God.
Professor, you were never tied up.
What?
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?
That I did it because I'm lonely?
That my daughter isn't in town?
That she never comes to see me, because she finds me too manipulative?
Or you could say you're sorry for the whole thing.
Yes, I suppose that would be accurate.
And that, as compensation for the mental anguish you caused us, you'll give us an A. Jeff.
Overreaching?
Fair enough.
Maybe you can grade us separately.
That way, Shirley and Annie can get their As.
No, Jeffrey, you can give us a F or you can give us an A, but we should all get the same grade.
God's sake, don't rub it in.
Very well.
Seeing as you saved me from my yearly Christmas tradition of plum pudding, roasted goose and updating my suicide note, I suppose I could give you a C. IEIIE Plus.
A rabbit hole.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring Annie.
Oh, my God.
Wow, that's really great.
All right.
Oh, ho-ho!
Poppy-poppy paper.
No, there's a gift in there.
Yeah.
Buttered noodles.
My favorite.
Oh!
I didn't get anyone gifts, so my gift to you all is you get to lord it over me for the next year.
No, stupid, a gift doesn't create an obligation.
It's the obligation that's a gift.
I gotta drop a deuce.
See you, guys.
Riding in a one horse Hey, it's Chang.
No, they're not expelled.
I have to do something else.
Ahh!
I couldn't stay mad at you guys.
Here.
I was gonna save these for the real Christmas day, but these guys were getting antsy.
Hi, there.
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!
Ohh!
August.
And this one is James.
And this one is Fiona.
And these two guys are Jeffrey.
I wonder what's happening in the darkest timeline.
Timeline?
Abed, there are no dark timelines.
Your Honor, I may not have a right arm but I am armed with what's right.
My client, Ms. Edison, did rob several drug stores, and, yes, she did stab several pharmacists, but let's talk about the bigger crime, that someone so beautiful has been removed from society.
Ms. Edison, you are hereby released from Greendale Insane Asylum.
Are you sure you don't have a problem with our age difference?
Yeah, I wish you were even younger.
Now, the others are waiting.
We've got a prime timeline to destroy.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Come on.
I got class in 15 minutes.
This should not be that difficult.
We need to figure out an idea for our final history project.
What we need to figure out is Greendale's obsession with group assignments.
Heh.
Classic herd mentality.
All right, Britta doesn't have one.
Who else?
I've been told I look like a Kennedy.
Not an idea.
That's a statement.
Anyone not on medication.
Jeff, we have to take this seriously.
This assignment?
This we have to take seriously?
"Pick any moment from history and tell me about it.
Be as creative as you want.
Or not.
I don't care.
Professor Cornwa" He didn't finish his name.
Okay, yes.
He phoned this one in, but my run at Valedictorian is in jeopardy.
As is mine.
As is Shirley's, and I took one for the team by accepting that C-plus on our last history paper.
As did I. As did Shirley.
I'd think you'd wanna help me get back on top.
Or me.
Shirley, I'm speaking for both you and me.
Then you might want to teach your mouth how to say "We," "our" and "us" I've been told I look like a Kennedy.
Nope, still a random statement, and still useless.
Okay.
How about this?
We do a series of banners-- Great, it's settled.
You don't know what I'm gonna say.
Don't need to.
I have no intention of being here late.
Your banner thing sounds doable, and this assignment, so passable.
And passable assures my graduation, so we are doing doable and passable.
Uh, speaking of tomorrow, Troy and Britta, have you decided what you're gonna do for your one-year anniversary?
Of?
Your first date?
Â©lhu That was a test and you failed.
Kidding.
You guys are dating?
Man.
Somebody's sure working her way around the table.
Aren't you?
You should really do something special, something romantic.
Like go back to Sefior Kevin's for lunch, where it all began.
Heh-heh-heh.
Yeah, sure.
We could do that.
Sure.
That sounds fun.
Speaking of anniversaries, it is the third anniversary of me and Abed watching Freaky Friday for the first time.
Oh.
That you remember?
Movie Trolley is having an "end of the video-store-chain industry" sale, so I got you a six-pack of body-switching movies and a two-year-old box of Raisinets, all for under 5 bucks.
Whoo!
All right, man.
Change-Up, 13 Going on 30, Judge Reinhold.
Oh.
Freaky Friday.
Oh, Troy, you are so thoughtful.
I wish I had the capacity for sentimentality like you do.
Me?
I wish I was more like you.
No emotional hang-ups, endless cool adventures.
You have it so easy.
No, you do, Troy.
No, you do, Abed.
I wish I could switch places with you for just one day.
Oh.
Sorry.
Routine light-switch check.
I thought that would work.
Yeah, we're all floored it didn't.
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said It can be here We could be roped up, tied up Dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one They all just fade away Good morning.
Oh, and, um Happy one-year anniversary.
Yes.
That would be this day.
Look, I know that it was awkward yesterday.
They pointed it out, and we didn't remember, but that doesn't mean we should make some big deal out of it, right?
No, I'm looking forward to it.
Super looking forward to it.
I'm just saying Yeah.
Same page.
Excuse me.
Hey, buddy, wake up.
Remember yesterday, when we faked a body-switching thing and it didn't work?
Well, now, it's actually worked.
So right now-- I'm you and you're me.
Oh, my God.
This is wrinkling my brain.
Of all the days.
I got a big important meeting with my study group.
Me too.
Oh, boy.
Here goes nothing.
Heh.
We're telling the story of the American Revolution through banners.
Everyone is responsible for one.
To maximize efficiency, I've designated areas.
Colored pencils and markers, paints, puffy paint.
Yes, there's a difference.
Decoupage and glitter, and this is the approval station where Shirley and I will decide whether you have to start over.
Annie, remember, we're doing doable and passable.
We're doing whatever it takes to help us Thank you.
beat Leonard.
Wait, Leonard is now the front-runner for Valedictorian?
You're getting beat by Leonard.
He's so old.
All right.
Yes, we slipped below Leonard, but Annie and I are a close three and two, respectively.
Annie is the three.
That is what respectively suggests.
Heh.
Whoa, that was weird.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
We didn't mean to do that.
We know exactly where we sit.
Um, what's going on with you guys?
Thank God you noticed.
Remember when we pretended to switch bodies?
Unfortunately, yes, dorks.
Well, it really happened.
I'm actually Abed.
And I'm actually Troy.
I don't care who's who.
We're all here, and that's all I need to complete this passable project in a doable amount of time.
In order to switch back, we have to re-create the moment this happened.
The DVD is missing.
Of course.
I have to find it while Troy goes on a date with Britta.
What?
Hey, here's a fun sci-fi thing.
How about you make a banner as Troy and you make a banner as Abed, and we'll be done within the hour.
Uh, per banner, if we're lucky.
And that's if we want an A. You two need to let go of the pressure to get an A. I deserve to be number one.
Sorry.
Or me.
Sorry.
I have to go talk to Troy.
Yes, please.
Tell your boyfriend and his boyfriend that playtime is over.
Annie, Shirley, go find out what's keeping Leonard on top.
And Abed won't switch back until we get that DVD.
I'll deal with that.
Then we are meeting back here and getting up into some puffy paint and doing our doable, passable banners.
What do you want me to do?
Stay alive.
Or don't.
I'm on it.
Wait, Troy.
I'm Abed.
Oh, right.
Uh, Troy, could you please excuse us?
You were weird this morning, and now, well, weirder.
Are we still on for Sefior Kevin's, or are you guys doing this whole switchy thing?
Actually, he's kind of going through some stuff.
Oh.
Is he having some issues that he's having trouble dealing with?
Yeah, he kind of needs this, so he's really laying into it.
Oh, so he might need an almost therapist.
Perhaps I'll pencil him in for a session, you know, after my date with Troy.
See you later, Abed.
Dean, I need you.
It's happening.
Shut the door.
What?
Hm?
Dean, I need you to give this DVD to Troy and Abed.
I love those movies.
They should make more of them.
They're a timeless tale.
Why can't you give it to them?
Troy and Abed think they switched bodies while holding onto a Freaky Friday DVD, which, of course, is now missing and they can't switch back until they find it.
I'd give them this one myself, but they'll think that I bought it, which I did.
Wait.
How did they switch bodies?
Well, they held onto the DVD and said: "I wish I could switch places with you for just one day".
Sorry.
Routine light-switch check.
That is not a thing.
What?
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
I'm you?
What?
No, you're not.
Of course, it's fricking Friday.
There's no justification to be made because it can't happen, weirdo.
Whatever, dean.
Please leave your office so I can start to work on your weird body that I'm now stuck in.
You're not even holding a phone.
So, Troy, how's Abed coping?
I mean, with his day in your body?
You'd have to ask him.
I, for one, am freaked.
Look at his arms and legs.
He's like the pick-up sticks of people.
Do you think he's trying to hide from something he's not understanding?
If you're worried about Abed, you should talk to him.
Right.
I should talk to him.
Well, well, well.
John McLame.
Never thought I'd see your face again.
Back for more, huh?
I'm sorry, back for what?
Punishment.
Last time I saw you, you got your panties all in a wad because I said Die Hard was a suckfest of a movie.
Wait, what?
You hate Die Hard?
That sounds insane to me.
It is, without a doubt, the most unnecessary movie ever made.
I'm not who you think I am, man.
What else do you hate about the movie?
Because I would love to hear all of your opinions.
Well, I mean, where to even start?
It's riddled with plot holes.
There's no logic to it.
I would rather watch a napkin sit and do nothing all day than to even endure the trailer for Die Hard.
Wow.
That's hatred.
Babe, we should order.
I'm both starving and another word for wanting food.
Troy.
Thank God, you've come to your senses.
You answered to Troy.
We're in public.
I have to.
I'm Abed.
Of course, you are.
Well, Abed, I found the DVD.
You can switch back now.
Hm.
That's the remake.
In the original, the mom and daughter exclaimed: "I wish I could switch places with you for one day".
In that one, there's a magic cookie.
I wondered what the differences were.
Listen, why don't I pitch you a remake of a remake where my magic mouth tells you to drop the act because Abed isn't even here?
Then you cough up the DVD, we go tell Abed you're back in your bodies so we can go do doable and passable banners.
First, that's a terrible movie.
Second, I understand why you're frustrated.
But this is happening.
This happened.
Unless we find that DVD-- No, let's go find this DVD.
Let's waste more of my life.
We were the last ones to leave the study room.
Maybe one of the janitors took it.
Let's go find that janitor.
You can switch bodies with him.
Or maybe with his magic mop-- Stop pitching.
It's not your thing.
You're right.
That's ridiculous, unlike what we're doing.
Dean?
Yeah, come in.
I'd stop what I'm doing, but then I'd be depriving you of the view.
You're welcome.
What's up?
Um, is this a bad time?
Uh, I'm in Greendale, stuck in the body of a man who could be Gollum's shadow, so, yeah, I'd say it's half past suck.
Heh.
Totally.
"Half past suck".
That's funny.
Okay.
That's creepy.
Uh, we're losing to Leonard in the race of Valedictorian.
We were wondering if we could peek at his transcripts to see how that is even possible.
Are you serious?
Mm.
You mean put my integrity on the line?
You want me to jeopardize the reputation of this school that I've spent so long protecting?
You're right.
We're sorry.
And that is what I would be saying if I gave a crap.
Awesome.
Ah, here's the answer.
Back in 1968, Leonard got an A in rotary phone maintenance.
Since then, he's been taking every other class pass-fail to keep a perfect GPA.
What does this mean?
It means we're taking an old man down.
You're welcome.
What is wrong with you?
I don't know.
How's your bean burrito?
Good.
Thank you for ordering for me.
I know what you always get.
Yeah, you know me so well.
I know a lot about you.
You grind your teeth at night.
I know about your tattoo.
Which one?
The Greenpeace one you haven't gotten because you're afraid of needles.
Did Troy tell you these things?
I am Troy.
Well, it must upset Abed to hear all of this relationship talk.
He doesn't seem to care.
Maybe.
But maybe he doesn't like talking to you about us.
I could see that causing him to act out.
I don't see that.
I don't think he's that invested.
But he talks to you about us.
I talk to him.
What do you say when you talk to him about us?
Do you tell him that things are good?
I don't know.
Are they?
Well, what do you think?
Well, I guess I wonder why we didn't remember our anniversary.
Not everybody's Annie.
No, but I don't know.
Seems like, you know, that would be special to us, like, especially if things were good.
Something we'd wanna celebrate.
Well, we are.
Are we?
Yes, Lord Brickell, I was indeed down by the stables.
Damn, man.
Ain't you ever heard of knocking?
Yep, heard it when I did it a second ago.
They've seen too much.
Let's kill them.
Stand down, Crazy Schmidt.
What we're doing is none of their business.
We're having murder mystery night.
I was fine with "None of your business".
We're looking for a Freaky Friday DVD.
I love those movies.
They should make more of those.
Nope.
We left it in study room F last night.
Everything we find goes to lost-and-found.
Great, show us.
And the wasting-my-life tour continues.
Leonard.
We just looked at your transcript.
I knew this day would come.
I'm out of here.
There you go.
My work here is done.
You're one and two again.
Now you can direct your anger and resentment at each other.
Congrats.
Classic wrap-up.
Shut up, Leonard.
I've got a picture of your old nose.
It was a lateral move.
Annie.
Why is this happening?
Holy makes-complete-sense-at-this-school.
FYI, one of these piles is load-bearing, so, uh, yeah, watch that.
Jeez.
This is gonna be harder than I thought.
This DVD isn't gonna find itself.
And neither are we, Troy, because it's not in here and you know that.
This is dumb.
Why are you so committed to this bit?
If you're really a friend to Abed, to me, then you'll end it now.
Sorry.
I have to keep going for Troy.
You don't have to dig through all this stuff.
I will.
I know it isn't your problem.
I'm just glad I'm here.
This is the sweeter end of the deal.
Troy still has to go on his date with Britta.
I don't understand this whole relationship thing, or why Troy would even want to be in one.
How long have you felt this way?
Or at least, how long have you been talking to Abed about this?
Not that long.
It's more lately, I guess.
It's felt different, like we're working at it too hard.
And he doesn't think it should be.
It should be easy, but he says it isn't.
We're just going through the motions.
He's afraid if he doesn't, it just ends.
Then what?
What if they're not friends anymore?
He'd hate that.
He'd hate himself.
I don't wanna lose what we had.
So he's here, at this point, not knowing how to talk to her, not knowing how to tell her that he wants to break up.
Wait, are you breaking up with me?
I think so?
I'm sorry, Jeff.
I shouldn't have brought you down here into any of this, especially for a bit.
I know you don't respect them.
That's true.
They're dumb and I stand by that, but committing to them isn't.
I wish I had the courage to commit to a bit like you, Abed, or to a relationship like Troy.
Committing is hard because we're all scared of what happens when we find out we committed to the wrong thing, but there's no shame in what Troy's done.
He put himself out there and he really tried, and that proves he cares.
That said, and as hard as it may seem, right now, Troy needs to show he cares.
He needs to put himself out there and own how he feels.
That proves he's a man.
So I don't think this is the way either of us thought this would go.
No, I can't say that I did.
I mean, not this.
Not us here.
But I can say that whenever you guys switch back to your original bodies, I wanna thank Abed for being such a good friend to both of us.
Troy, wait.
Don't do it like this.
I understand why you had to go high-concept.
You're scared.
But Britta deserves better.
Troy, it's time.
I wish I had my own body back.
Sorry, routine light-switch check.
Oh, I've been meaning to see this.
First, the easiest part, because it's the most obvious.
I'm sorry.
I think I proved today that I'm not ready for this.
I wanted it to work.
I did.
I care about you so much and I love being around you.
I just think I'm better as your friend.
Because that I know I can be good at.
So I'm number two again, which is what it is.
But if I'm not going to be Valedictorian, I'm glad it will be you.
Heh.
Me too.
You mean you hope it's me if it's not you or that you're glad it's you?
Yes.
Thanks for everything you did today.
I'm sorry I pulled you into it.
That was my problem not yours.
It's the best way someone's ever woken me up in my life.
How was lunch?
It was good.
it really was.
I'll tell you about it later.
Oh, there you are.
I got bored waiting, so I went ahead and did our whole project.
Pierce, no offense, but banners are kind of my special Ah.
Holy makes-no-sense-whatsoever.
Whole thing took 25 minutes, tops.
Huh.
Early weekend?
Early weekend?
Guys, I need to apologize for my behavior today.
When I switched bodies with Jeffrey-- Nope.
-- I thought I knew what it would be like to have Jeffrey inside me.
That did not happen.
But as it turns out, having Jeffrey inside of me-- Nope again.
Only brought out the worst in me.
Which is to say, having Jeffrey inside of me-- No one was inside of anyone.
-- was wrong.
To have Jeffrey inside of me.
Shut up.
So I'm sorry.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I scolded Leonard today, and according to Greendale bylaws, I now have to grant him three wishes.
Um, we need to get scolded by the dean immediately.
Oh, man.
Football is "frun," that is an interest I have.
Also, plumbing and air conditioning are things I think about.
Come on, man.
What-- ?
What's happening?
I couldn't-- I'm sorry.
Keep rolling.
Okay.
Come on.
Feetball is f-- Did I say-- ?
Ha-ha!
Feetball?
Dorks, stop doing outtakes.
You switched bodies last week.
Hey, guys, I just want to apologize.
Oh, my God.
Hey, dean, walk much?
Am I right?
I'm sorry, I never do this.
Dean, we stopped doing outtakes.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah, we did that.
No worries.
Thanks for including me.
Okay.
Whoa!
Heh.
No?
Still not doing it?
Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Shirley, did you date Roger Ebert?
Excuse me?
Nothing.
Hm.
Britta, take pictures of your feet, post them on the Internet for money?
Shah!
No.
Guys, this history final is going to be killer.
We have to study.
It's no fair Professor Cornwallis turned all hard-assed again.
Lucky Pierce.
Donating his kidney to Gilbert to get out of it.
I never thought he'd be that generous.
He did seem disappointed the operation didn't involve sleeping with a Russian woman and a tub of ice.
I am studying history.
I'm studying our history.
Abed.
Nobody bite.
We agreed, no biting.
But, Jeff, it's a graduation gift.
We seem like a group of people from diverse backgrounds who have become friends.
According to my research, our paths have crossed many times.
Destined to meet, like a team of superheroes.
This is our origin story.
And here we go.
Abed, we don't have origin stories.
We have lives.
Well, at least-- Yep, just me.
You're saying we're connected like the classic French film trilogy Bleu, Blanc, Rouge.
Like something more accessible, like Unbreakable.
I know it's disappointing, but we're not superheroes.
This is the real world, not some comic-book adventure.
I've done it.
I've infiltrated the school.
I've learned its secrets.
I've gained everyone's trust.
And now, on the anniversary of my empire's destruction, vengeance will be mine.
No, vengeance will be ours.
Okay, can you stop that?
It really creeps me out.
I'm sorry.
I just really love this thing.
SkyMall.
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said It can be here We could be roped up, tied up Dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one They all just fade away I have been doing research.
Once I find the last missing pieces, I'll have conclusive proof that we were all destined to meet.
This is how we're all connected.
The crazy quilt of destiny.
"The loom of fate" was already taken.
Really?
I don't care what tricks or nonsense you have in your scrapbook.
No way you'll get me to believe there's some force controlling my destiny.
You used that particular phrasing because you've seen Star Wars.
Oh Everybody's seen Star Wars.
You first saw it when it was re-released in 1982 at the Palladium at 4:15 in the afternoon.
Best time you had with your father.
How did you know that?
You keep this ticket in your wallet.
Abed, you can't-- Just give it back.
Oh!
Our story begins in the distant mists of a lost era, 2008.
I know you're all wondering how I do it.
How do I balance straight A's, extracurriculars and Israeli folk dancing every Friday night?
It's a simple matter of organization, dedication and And we're back.
Then I drink your milkshake.
That will never get old.
You guys gotta see my Juno.
Hey, Troy.
Heard you weren't doing that great in Algebra, and, you know, if you need a tutor for math, I'd be happy to help.
I'm being recruited by colleges to play football.
I don't have time for math.
The only thing that matters to me are statistics.
Ooh!
Uh, that's also a type of math.
We already knew I went to high school with Troy.
It's not like he even remembered I existed.
I don't remember her at all.
We should probably drop this.
Where's Pierce on this chart?
His contribution has been noted.
"Pierce Hawthorne.
Fixture at Greendale.
Unavoidable".
Is that a sad face?
I wouldn't know.
Look deeper.
Here.
Take this, for example.
It's a receipt I found in Shirley's sock drawer.
You went in my room for some comic book?
Oh, no, my feet were cold.
Here.
Should wash those.
The receipt was dumb luck, but it proves that we were at the mall on the exact same day.
Do you remember what you bought for $54 at Love Hut?
What?
Hm?
No.
So excited about tonight, honey.
Uh-huh.
It's been too long since we had adult time without the kids.
Ha-ha-ha!
Oh?
Well, I may have an anniversary surprise for you too.
Well, I'm in public, but you know you gonna get it, right?
You gonna get it.
Hee-hee-hee!
So we were at the mall on the same day.
Unbreakable.
That's all right.
Won't need it today.
But Kevin always takes the mail.
Well, today's mail's kind of important.
It's the day that I send in Greendale's lease renewal.
Lease renewal?
It's a critical document.
See, Greendale sublets our land from the Arapaho nation.
Miss a renewal and faster than you can say Wounded Knee, we turn into a casino and midsize concert venue.
So you only trust me with busywork?
Oh, no, that's not-- Kevin.
Uh-- Ha, ha!
I cannot resist those puppy dog eyes.
Here.
Ha-ha-ha!
Ah!
Now, I have time to hit the seamstress.
Guess all I have to say is: "Ladies and gentlemen, Greendale Resort and Casino presents Steve Winwood".
I need to find the one last smoking gun.
I think this might be it.
I found it in the Greendale Communist Worker.
Look familiar?
Oh, my God.
This is me and my anarchist collective at the courthouse.
We called ourselves the An-Her-Chists.
Oh You guys know Jeff's in that photo?
What?
Jeff, my man.
Congrats on getting your case thrown out.
Your argument was a masterpiece.
I mean, it was definitely creative.
Creative?
He convinced a judge to forgive five years back taxes by getting him to agree you humping an American flag to "Back in Black" was not stripping, but actually not-for-profit performance art.
Boom!
Blew me away.
Come on, let's go.
Thank you.
Thank you for defending a woman's right to use her body however she chooses.
I can honestly say that right is very important to me.
Mr. Winger, can we get a quote?
You're a hero.
Hi.
Hi.
Guys, we have got to capitalize on this momentum.
It is time An-Her-Chist finally takes a stand on animals' rights.
There is a medical lab in an office building nearby.
Next week, we break in there-- We were thinking this is our last hurrah.
This was our first hurrah.
We're just getting going.
Britta, we're done.
I had a hamburger and suddenly I'm not cold all the time.
Fine.
Go.
I don't need you.
What's an anarchist to do without her organization?
Jeffrey, how could you?
Well, I was a really good lawyer.
Mysti is the stripper that Andre cheated on me with and you defended her.
Shirley, I-- If you hadn't got that home wrecker off, Andre never would have met her.
Jeff ends Shirley's marriage.
See?
I told you, we were always destined to meet.
Hm.
I knew they went to the rec center.
I had no idea their paths crossed again.
This is great.
We're filling in plot holes.
Good stuff.
It's really good.
Have I missed something?
These aren't plot holes.
This is my life.
This connection makes our story more compelling.
Like when Uncle Ben is murdered in Spider-Man.
My marriage almost ended.
If it weren't for Jeff, thatjezebel would've been in jail instead of between my sheets.
Hey, this is not my fault.
And the case didn't work out too great for me either.
It was supposed to make my career, but it put a target on my back.
Michael Phelps, really?
And it doesn't affect his breathing?
No.
Mysti, can I talk to Jeff for a moment?
I will go, uh, powder my nose.
For real.
Listen.
There's this rumor going around the firm that you never received an undergraduate degree.
That's ridiculous.
I know.
I mean, some jag is obviously jealous of your rising star.
But the fact is, until this is settled, the bar isn't gonna let you practice.
So you got caught in your own lie?
I almost lost my family.
How does your little tragedy even compare?
I had to go to school here.
Abed, do not write that down.
It's not like I made Andre cheat.
Well, I happen to think it's cool that we're all connected, even if it's in bad ways.
I'm finally willing to forgive Annie for ruining high school.
Wait, I ruined your time in high school?
Yeah, you did.
You guys doing keg stands?
Yeah.
Anyone can do a keg stand.
I'm gonna do a keg flip.
Hey, everybody, look at this.
Troy, Troy, Troy Aah!
Oh!
Oh, my football knee!
Why?
Can I have some corn nuts?
No!
No!
That had nothing to do with me.
And you admitted you faked that injury.
You couldn't take the pressure of football recruiters.
I faked my injury because of what you said to me.
Because of what I said?
You didn't remember I went to school with you.
I may have lied about that too.
Hey, guys, it's time to do senior class superlatives.
Okay, the first award is Most Handsome.
And the winner is Troy Barnes.
Of course it is.
Most Popular, Troy Barnes.
No.
You guys.
Awesome.
Best Smile.
Ha-ha.
I gotta keep them white.
Best Moves.
Best Practical Joker.
Coolest Locker.
And now the last award of the night, Most Likely to Succeed.
Okay, this has to go to me, because I am most likely to succeed.
It's just a fact.
You guys know.
And the winner is Troy Barnes.
You have got to be kidding me!
Troy Barnes, most likely to succeed?
I'm the damn Valedictorian and head of student council, and president of Campus Crusade for Christ and I'm Jewish!
And you are just some mindless robot.
You just go wherever they tell you to run.
I'm sorry.
Do you go to my school?
Oh!
Pop, POP- Your words cut me more than hundreds of non-tempered glass shards could.
I had six different reconstructive surgeries.
I went through withdrawal.
I had to smile when I didn't feel like smiling.
That hurts my face.
Can we all just stop dredging up the past?
The only thing your fate web thing does is point out how fragile our happiness is.
If only Jeff hadn't defended that woman.
If only Andre hadn't met her after I left.
If I didn't pick up my kids at the mall-- Wait.
When?
Which mall?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
What movie you guys gonna see?
Phantom Menace.
It's kind of old.
And why do you wanna see it?
Because we like Star Wars.
If you like Star Wars, why murder it, urinate on its grave?
Prequels are terrible.
Wouldn't Chewbacca at some point go: "Hey, Yoda, I know that guy"?
It has double light sabers.
That's stupid.
You're both stupid.
Well, why are you here to see the movie?
I'm not.
I go wherever it plays to warn people.
You've been warned.
A stranger said what to him?
Okay, fine.
I'll come get you.
I'm sorry, baby.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Okay, just stand there, okay?
This can't be.
Why do I have to go to a therapist?
After that woman chewed them out for three hours, the theater got a restraining order against you.
Hey, doc.
By the way, someone just stole your prescription pad.
I'm trying to liberate you!
You're the crazy man at the mall.
You're the one who got me busted for drugs.
You were out there somewhere and you weren't looking for me?
In fairness, running through a glass door might have been the drug tip-off.
All this time, I wondered what it was that brought our group together.
But I forgot one thing all heroes need.
They need an enemy.
Batman has the Joker, Justice League has Legion of Doom and this study group has me.
I'm the supervillain.
Why didn't I see it?
Emotionless, logical, smarter than everybody.
Hey.
I tried sawing off Jeff's arm.
Why do you keep saying that?
I should go.
Not safe around me.
I'm just as bad.
I couldn't handle the monkey so I traded it in for a glaucoma brownie, even though I knew if it bit someone, it would make them a teensy bit psychotic.
Britta's right.
We've all made some bad decisions.
And if you really wanna know who the villain is here, it's me.
Whee!
Yeesh.
Didn't think it possible to put more glitter on.
It's coming off you like Pigpen.
Well, some people seem to like it.
This married guy just gave me his phone number.
Can you believe his wife left him on their anniversary?
You gonna call him?
He did win a bunch of money.
I don't know.
You don't know what?
You're not married.
You gotta grab what you want in this life.
That's the way it works.
Someone just took something important from me.
And you know what?
I admire him for it.
All right.
I guess I'll go talk to him.
You do that.
And I'm gonna go get "crap on other people's lawns" drunk.
To a memorable evening for both of us.
You coincidentally affected some of us, but I actively endorsed pain.
I was the bad guy and I'd like to think I'm not that guy anymore.
Also, and I hate to bring this up, you did once make me pee myself.
Well, I guess we're even then.
I might finish studying at home.
Mm.
Just 10 minutes ago, I would've been so excited about that peeing thing.
I wanted to make a prequel and I ruined everything.
I guess it could happen to anyone.
I should write George Lucas a note of apology.
Okay, let's not get crazy.
And you didn't ruin anything.
May I sit here?
Shirley, what are you doing here?
Oh, just I wanted some yogurt and I do know you're not that person anymore.
Are you sure?
Because I was awfully good at it.
Well, we all do bad things every now and again.
I mean, I put a stripper's head through a jukebox.
What are you guys doing here?
I guess we all really wanted yogurt.
You know what's weird?
This is where I first decided to go to Greendale.
Wait, really?
This is where I was when I first decided to go to Greendale.
You're kidding me.
I know you're as disappointed as I am with the caliber of students we have at Greendale.
But the mall offers a whole new, valuable demographic of people awake during the daytime.
All right, I'll pass flyers at Yogurtsburgh.
Self-serve yogurt.
Those doofuses already know one marketable skill.
Okay, Ben But it still has the tags on!
So I lost the receipt.
It's not like I even got to wear it because my husband's a tasteless man-slut.
Wha-- ?
Oh.
Hey, littering.
This better not awaken anything in me.
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling Down, down, down God, this day.
I thought pushing that woman's head through a jukebox would make me feel better, but I'm just out of $54 and a marriage.
The Crystal Skull was aliens, so it's a pretty great film.
Down, down, down, down You guys seen this?
Guys, working the program with you has been so great.
I feel like I'm finally ready to get my life back on track.
Hm.
Last chance.
Just walk over there right now and apologize to the theater manager.
Midi-chlorians.
Midi-chlorians.
Fine.
Then you're not going to film school.
Hi.
Do you have any vegan fro-yo?
Do you know what fro-yo is?
Fine.
Do you have a job application?
Hey, that weird guy hasn't blinked once.
Oh, yeah.
What a dweeb.
Yeah, what a dweeb.
Oh, nice shot, man.
Ha, ha.
Do you work at Greendale?
Work?
That's putting it charitably.
Greendale Community College is a total joke.
They'd give a degree to a monkey.
Hey, does Ian Duncan still teach psychology at Greendale?
That drunken limey?
He's got tenure.
That's the one.
Maybe getting my degree won't be as hard as I thought.
Sir, what are you doing?
Can we get some help out here?
Some old guy broke the machine and is faking a heart attack.
Oh, wait.
Stupid.
Cool, cool, cool.
Wait.
So was that old guy really Pierce?
We'll never know because he'll never, ever remember.
What are the chances of us ending up at the same place, same time, twice?
Abed, it's amazing.
I mean, yes, 2008 was the height of the slightly sour frozen yogurt craze, but that still doesn't explain it.
Maybe we really were all meant to be together.
I'm not sure I understand it, but maybe we don't have to.
What I do know is that the ways our paths crossed, even when they were bad, all led us to this point.
And I wouldn't have it any other way.
What you're saying is we're all each other's Uncle Ben's murder.
And we're all Spider-Man.
Yeah.
Let's say I'm saying that.
Mm, I think we know whose will this really is.
Yeah, I think I do.
I'll be right back.
Hello?
Heh.
Hey, Abed.
Ah.
Just doing some Pilates.
I was looking for you.
Wha-- ?
I-- We discovered you're the reason we all went to Greendale.
You linked all our stories, like how the Cosmic Cube assembled the Avengers.
That, and the $4-billion deal with Disney.
Turns out you were always one of us.
So I came to see if you wanted to get some frozen yogurt.
Really?
That's That's all I ever wanted.
But it's too late.
Here's another thing I realized.
Because of you we got to reinvent ourselves at Greendale.
Everyone should have the same chance, don't you think, Chang?
It's not Chang.
It's Kevin.
How long have you known?
Known what?
Only you know who you really are.
Also, you may have experimental monkey fever.
You coming?
Yeah.
Can we stop at the post office?
I have something to mail for the dean.
It's confidential and I don't wanna talk about it, so stop interrogating me.
I'm out.
I Chang'd my mind.
You're too in to be out.
Hey.
Hi.
You want some refills?
On me, huh?
Refills?
You want some?
Time for plan B.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hey.
Get out of my chair, or I'll have you disbarred.
Oh, wait.
That already happened.
Cash.
Tango.
My old partner in my new firm.
Oh.
Does it get any better?
Not unless you leave.
Heh, heh, still got it.
So, ahem, a little birdie told me you're graduating kiddie college.
You must be excited to get that lollipop.
Hey.
It's a sticker.
Ha!
I know you're busy-- Not.
-- So allow me to whip it out.
Come work with me.
You'll be a full partner, six figures, corner office, three secretaries.
What's that?
Not enough money?
I'll double it.
Bam.
Done.
That's how we negotiate.
Lunch?
Wow, I drive a hard bargain.
Mark, aren't you worried I'm a little out of practice?
Only cases I've tried lately are about sandwiches and yams.
You're a better lawyer when you weren't a lawyer than most lawyers I know.
It's still in you.
I'll give it some thought.
Just shake my hand, idiot.
It's simple.
I like simple.
Take a look around, Winger.
This is your new old life.
I don't get it.
We just had Christmas, and now it's warm outside.
Of course it is.
We just finished Fall-Spring semester.
Bring on Summer-Winter.
I can't wait.
My final class is called Opinions.
Taylor is scheduled to teach.
But I have a rebuttal.
Lucky.
I transferred to Forensics late and got the worst classes.
Skull Fragment Collection, Advanced Advanced Decomp and Intro to Senselessness were full.
I still have a year of AC repair left.
I passed my classes, so I do yoga while teachers write down my wisdoms.
Wait a minute.
Jeff passed History.
He's graduating early.
I'm totally unprepared to deal with this.
No, Annie, please, don't-- Gotcha!
Well, it's official.
It's on a banner.
Congratulations, Jeffrey.
You worked hard not to work hard to earn that degree.
You took blow-off classes and electives.
What did you end up majoring in?
Education.
You had to win.
I was inches from the finish line.
You have so many credits, they have grand-credits.
Just graduate.
When's the graduation ceremony?
Never.
It's community college.
You just send in some papers and they stop charging you.
It's moving, in its own way.
So this is it?
A banner and soda Troy forgot to bring?
No.
As far as graduations go, it's boring but grounded.
I was hoping for more.
Can we walk with you to the dean's office?
What, now?
No.
I was gonna mail it in next week, or, you know, whenever.
Don't be silly.
We started as a study group, we'll finish as a study group.
All for one, and one dude we can all leave behind.
Everybody, go quickly!
Go, go, go.
Hey.
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said It can be here We could be roped up, tied up Dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one They all just fade away All right, Mr. Winger, et al, Britta.
Emotions are running high so I will keep this tight and short.
You always do.
I see you have all the necessary paperwork.
Necessary?
You asked for proof of inseam.
Ha.
Jeffrey.
I am gonna miss our playful, "get a room already" banter.
Oh, dean.
I can come back.
No, I can do this.
Just need to sign the old John Dean-cock and you will be graduated.
So this is it?
IW!
I, uh, expected a little more pageantry.
I'm listening.
Annie's right.
We should throw a party to mark the occasion.
A small one.
Ooh!
The teensiest.
Just close friends, a small cake.
Some flowers, an archway.
A string quartet.
He could wear a suit.
Starting to sound like a wedding.
Not a wedding.
No.
Just your average diploma signing, to which you're all invited tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Is that enough time to plan a whole wedding?
Uh, absolutely.
I'll get my book.
Listen, I can't do a big party.
It's too much.
Oh, I see what's going on here.
This is about you getting cold feet about graduating.
Pshaw.
I've been looking forward to graduation since freshman registration.
I got a job lined up at my old partner's firm.
Well, then, let them eat cake.
It's just I'm worried that the group might not be able to handle it, you know, emotionally.
Everyone wants you to graduate, Jeff.
What about Abed?
The stress of me leaving might send him spiraling.
Give him some more credit.
He's really progressed since he opened up to my therapizing.
Do you remember when he wouldn't stop talking about that timeline thing?
The one where I lost my arm?
And Pierce died.
Annie went insane.
He blamed it all on you throwing some dice.
He has not brought that up in months.
You're right, Britta.
I just need to give Abed a chance.
Then it's settled.
The six of us will take Astronomy.
So you're leaving me out.
We're leaving Jeff out.
I'm not even the one who gets left out anymore.
Everything's Jeff, Jeff-- Jeff!
This seat taken?
Oh, you!
So everyone excited about the big shindig?
Totally.
I was worried about the wedding-graduation mash-up, but it's testing well with women.
Oh, that's a load off.
Hey, we should probably figure out who's bringing the soda.
Just so there's not another hang-up.
I brought it.
I just drank it all.
It's okay.
I've got it covered.
No, no, no.
You've already done so much.
Besides, I think I have a fun and fair way to decide which of the six of us will bring the soda.
We'll roll for it.
It didn't land on a number.
That probably means nothing.
Or it means everything.
Let's hope not.
I'll bring the soda.
Don't worry.
I'll make sure there aren't any hang-ups.
Must I bear this cross forever?
I was hoping for more.
Catherine?
Do not even tell me you dropped that cake.
Parasites.
Hey.
What's going on?
Why are you trying to avoid graduating?
I wish I knew.
I think it's because you're scared to take this law job with your old partner.
But don't let that stop you from graduating.
Take the job, don't take the job.
Either way, your friends are always here to support you.
Good to know.
See you at graduation.
And they call us the worst.
Took you long enough.
Nobody said you had to travel naked.
Oh, you brought the good one.
You hold that, I'll do the sleeve.
Wait for the click.
There.
Ahh.
Good.
Ah.
Middle finger works great now.
It's worse than I thought.
They made Lame Jeff too lame to leave Greendale.
He's got to take that job.
But how do we make him do that?
By turning the study group against him so he'll run screaming from this rancid cocoon into the welcoming arms of darkness.
How hard is that to understand?
It's not.
I just like when you talk down to me like a child.
Oh!
Jeff!
It's bad luck to see the graduation before the graduation.
I had to talk to you.
Today is bringing up so many emotions.
It's a lot to take in.
I'm not making you feel nervous about graduating, am I?
Well, you are making me feel something.
And it's not about graduating.
I'm saying I'm hot for you.
Me?
Heh.
Is this for real?
Is my beating heart for real?
Oh, Annie.
I don't know if it's the beautiful decorations or the impending floral archway, but there's something about this that feels so right.
This is the perfect moment to remember you by.
Remember me by?
I'm not going anywhere.
Exactly.
You're going nowhere.
I'm about to return to my cool, adult lawyer life.
You're gonna be stuck here playing high school.
Why are you saying this?
So you face the facts.
Once I graduate, I'm gone.
Winger, streaking on your last day of school?
Respect.
Oh, so I got the save-the-date for your graduation.
Should I bring a date or try to hook up there?
I'm not going to your stupid graduation, jerk.
I can't believe you said those things to me.
What things?
Don't play dumb.
You wanna leave?
Leave.
See if I care.
What did you do?
I have no earthly idea.
Hook up there.
Hm.
Yeah.
Hello, Abed.
Hello, Evil Jeff.
What?
How did you-- ?
I know an evil doppelgÃ©nger when I see one.
Plus, your arm makes noise.
Silence!
Are you here to kill Jeff?
Oh, you non-evils are so naive.
I'm here to save Jeff from the smothering teat of his study group.
Is that a paintball gun?
You wish.
Cool.
Wait.
Cold.
How did I get to the dean's office?
Hi.
Out of my chair, monkey.
The darkest timeline.
Annie.
Um, okay, let's start with "huh"?
Jeff, I'm sorry.
I made it all up.
I've been so upset about you graduating that I've gone a little crazy, emotionally.
Oh, good.
I thought I was losing my mind.
Make it up to you with a hug?
This breakfast-sandwich cart is such a great idea.
It's never too early for Shirley to make a boatload off of college kids.
Speaking of great-idea-having, hear me out.
It's called the Troy-jan Horse.
It goes bread, lettuce, ham, ham, bacon, chocolate-- Oh, how you doing, the graduate?
Just stopping by to hand out some un-vites to my graduation.
Here's one for the desperate housewife who spends more time with her pathetic business than her family.
And you.
If you call a sandwich a Troy-jan Horse, people are gonna think there's horse in it.
Oh, my dreams.
Whatever, losers.
See you never.
Where's Abed?
Is anyone here?
Hello, Abed.
Welcome to our home.
Hello, Evil Abed.
It's Abed.
After we met, I abandoned my evil goal to focus on brightening my own timeline.
Do you live here alone?
Yes.
Evil Troy moved out when I gave up the cause.
He only listens to Evil Jeff, who took over this year, villain-wise.
Jeff left Greendale and became a lawyer, but the more evil he got, the more he became tortured by the idea that there's a good Jeff out there.
Forced me to show him how to travel between timelines.
My God.
This is so cool.
I know.
You have no idea how long I've been waiting to talk.
Kind of a Superman III meets Star Trek meets The Cape.
The Cape was canceled.
Not here.
They retooled it for cable and it's awesome.
Wanna see it?
Desperately.
But I need to get back to my timeline and stop Evil Jeff.
Came to the person who could help.
Me.
I'll get you home, Abed.
But first, you'll need some supplies.
Hm.
Everyone must be running late.
Here, Jeffrey.
You're graduated.
Take your precious diploma and just go.
I cannot believe the hurtful things you said to me in my office.
I'll have you know that wanting pageantry in your life isn't a crime or a lifestyle choice.
Okay, Annie, something definitely weird is happening.
No one's here, the dean is mad at me, and he is never mad at me, and a third reason.
Congratulations, Jeff.
Don't worry about the study group.
You can talk to them later.
Why don't you and I go celebrate someplace private and boozy?
Annie, why are you acting like a mistress in a Lifetime movie?
Heh.
You're funny.
Oh, sweetheart, you dropped your phone earlier.
You've got a voice-mail from a guy named Mark?
You should call him.
I have to find the others and figure this out.
Crap.
We're losing him.
What?
"What"?
Who are you?
You're me?
"Who are you?
You're me"?
But how?
"But how"?
Enough of the pleasantries.
I've come from the darkest timeline to make sure you take that job.
It's essential to our future.
You want it, idiot, so take it.
I can't.
I've spent almost four years here, growing and changing and making dioramas.
I'm not that guy anymore.
You're wrong.
Greendale may have dulled your killer instinct, but trust me, it's still in you.
It's time to leave this place and reclaim your proper life.
No.
Not without my study group.
Ugh.
Now who's in a Lifetime movie?
Then I'll be rid of you another way.
Friendship!
Mm.
Cold.
Well, the subtle approach failed.
What's next?
Explain it slowly.
Need some help?
Let's burn this mother down.
Jeff must be graduating about now.
I wonder if anyone's there.
Doubt he cares.
Pierce won't even respond to my texts.
I wonder what terrible things Jeff said about him.
I've got some guesses.
Let me finish.
Look, I know this may sound crazy and more than a little convenient, but whatever I said to you, it wasn't me.
It was Evil Jeff.
Ha!
Come on.
Something happened when I rolled that die.
Something only nerds understand.
Mm-hm.
You have to believe me.
They're coming for us.
No.
We're coming for them.
Where you been?
Darkest timeline.
You never believe me, so I brought proof.
The doppeldeaner.
Abed brought me here to prove to all of you-- Whoa!
I figured these warping guns would convince you.
We've got an inter-dimensional battle on our hands.
Our evil counterparts are waging a war, and it's either us or us.
All right.
Let's light up these dark suckers.
Okay, everyone.
Stay sharp.
If you see yourself, warp on sight.
I'd like to warp myself to a dairy-free mudslide.
Ha, ha!
That's just vodka, Shirley.
I know what it is.
Aha!
Pierce?
We thought you were dead.
Hell, no.
After I got shot, I faked my death to teach you all a lesson.
Lesson about what?
Who can remember?
It was a year ago.
And yet here you all are, planning an invasion without me.
Again, we thought you were dead.
Listen, I can help you guys beat the Lame Study Group.
Just tell me how this works.
Fine.
It's complicated, but basically, the first person to shoot themselves wins.
Winner!
Well, that bow tied itself.
Dang, I got hair dye on my coat.
Dang, it's spreading.
Damn it, Britta.
Did you shoot yourself too?
Every time.
Hey.
Don't talk to her like that.
Every time.
We're here.
Scatter.
Get help.
Can't hide forever, Lame Annie.
Just let me shoot you.
You'll love the darkest timeline.
We're sleeping with Jeff there.
What?
We are?
All the time.
And he loves it.
Nobody sleeps with Jeff.
Not even me.
I've been counting bullets.
One of us is out.
Is it you?
Yes.
Why would you tell me that?
To sound intimidating?
Almost worked.
Bailing.
Okay.
Only Evil Jeff is left.
You've gotta take him out.
Why don't I give him what he wants?
Can't give up.
Why not?
Because it's not real.
Look around, Jeff.
Haven't you noticed the vending machines are full of meats and eggs?
Or that all the background students are attractive women?
Hi.
Yeah.
This is a world you've created in your own mind.
The real battle is within.
You're afraid to graduate.
You think Greendale has changed you.
Part of you wants Evil Jeff to win.
You could pretend you're the same guy you were.
But you're not.
You're stronger.
You're better.
You have friends.
No, screw that.
You have a family.
Wait.
If this is all in my mind, then I don't really need to fight him.
Don't logic this one away from me.
We finally figured out a way to make paintball cool again.
Hey, handsome.
On second thought, who needs to roll a die?
And who cares if we have soda?
As long as you guys are with me, I have everything I need to graduate.
Yeah.
Forget soda.
Friends, Greendalians, human beings, we are gathered here today to honor that sacred and eternal bond between a student and his dean.
Neither time nor distance nor screening one's calls could ever sever what nature herself has ordained.
When two men are drawn-- I'll take it from here.
Fair enough.
I was reaching.
Three and a half years ago, when I came to Greendale, I met six very important people.
Oof.
Burn on Britta.
Sorry, seven.
And meeting these people changed my life.
Yep.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.
Ha, ha, yeah, okay.
Whatever.
I'm so used to being the guy who can talk his way out of anything, but what do you say when you don't want a way out?
What you all have done for me is indescribable.
It's unbelievable.
And my love for you is immeasurable, even when you split it seven ways.
Well said, Jeffrey.
If anyone here should have just cause why Jeffrey Tobias Winger should not be graduated, speak now or forever-- Pierce.
You don't have to do this.
I'm ready to graduate.
Yeah?
Well, I'm ready to graduate first.
Seems oddly appropriate.
Congratulations, Pierce.
Pierce!
Perfect.
So, what's next for Jeffrey Winger?
I'm thinking I might look into some small local firms.
Use my big mouth to help the little guy.
Oh!
Plus, if I stay in town, I can pop by any time I want.
You know, just to settle group arguments about who misses me the most.
Oh.
What do you think?
T15Â» JD T15Â» JD Troy and Abed in the morning Welcome.
We've got a jam-packed show.
Let's get started.
Today, as always, we'll be visited by Greendale's king and supreme lord master, Dean Chang.
Looks like he'll be talking about squash.
Oh, I'm super excited for that.
And not only because it's mandatory.
Mm.
First, we'll take a spin around the map and find out what's happening in the universes that parallel ours.
Thanks, us.
I'm standing in timeline five where things are pretty much normal.
Normal?
Troy, people are on fire in Nairobi.
You call that normal?
I've become much more conscious of world issues since Troy and I decided to give our baby an African name.
Isn't that right, Chewbacca?
It means "he who hunts bounties".
Back to you.
Wow, it sounds like things are really heating up in Nairobi.
That's nothing compared to the fire in our studio audience.
Hey, idiots.
How many times have I told you the show doesn't really exist?
No one's watching.
Du h-doy.
We know.
Yeah, we're just messing around.
See you at lunch, Evil Jeff.
See you at lunch.
Troy and Abed in the morning
