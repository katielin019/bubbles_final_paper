{START OF EPISODE 1}
Giddyup!
Giddyup!
Meet Leslie Knope.
I am the pants queen!
Leslie loves whipped cream, dancing with friends, and working hard for the Parks Department of Pawnee, Indiana.
Cut it out, Tom.
- It never gets old.
She also loves her coworkers at City Hall.
Ron Swanson.
Tom Haverford.
Tommy Timberlake.
April Ludgate.
My mom is Puerto Rican.
That's why I'm so lively and colorful.
And Andy Dwyer.
Nailed it.
April and Andy like each other.
But when Andy accidentally kissed his ex-girlfriend, Ann Perkins, April left.
Wait.
April!
And he hasn't seen her since.
In the midst of all this love, two black hats rode into town.
Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born.
I believe I am that human being.
And they brought with them some disturbing news.
Effective tomorrow morning, the entire government will be shut down until further notice.
What will Leslie do next?
Will April and Andy make up and make out?
Find out this season on Parks and Recreation.
Starting right now.
Ron.
We're back.
Bully.
The bankrupt government of Pawnee has been shut down all summer, so it's been three months of no work, no meetings, no memos, no late nights, nothing.
I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
Rounding up the team, so exciting.
I have goose bumps.
Feel.
And that's why they call me Prince Charming.
Because I always find the glass slipper for my Cinderella.
These are way too tight.
Well, the real Cinderella didn't have hippo feet.
Tom, we're back.
Jeremy!
Suck it!
By the way, I've been giving away free sports bras to the girls at Hot Dog on a Stick.
Look, we can dance all day, but it's time to step up.
Are you buying 4,000 rubber nipples from me or not?
D, you have a visitor.
We back?
We're back.
All right.
Jerry.
Oh, my gosh.
Look who's here.
Leslie.
The nightmare's over, Jerry.
We're going back to work.
You're not going to need this anymore.
Come on!
I called shotgun.
Everybody heard me.
Well, I am usually not one for speeches.
So, goodbye.
Break's over, mofos.
Okay.
Here's the situation.
We are operating on a shoestring budget.
Park services have been slashed.
But we are all still here.
And we have a job to do.
Make the world's biggest pizza.
No, make this town fun for the people who live here.
Fine, but after that, the pizza is our top priority.
No, it's not.
We're getting pizza?
April, hey, it's me, Andy Dwyer.
This is like the 200th message I've left you, without a response.
So, if you're trying to tell me something, I do not know what it is because you won't call me back.
It is truly great to see all of you, huh?
It's great news!
Okay.
I have to run.
Ben.
The bad news, which I get to deliver, is this.
Your only work for the time being will be existing park maintenance.
So, that just means that we're in maintenance mode.
Yeah!
Jerry!
Okay.
See, I've spent the last few months brainstorming.
And I have some really great ideas and I put them in my idea binders.
I mean, they're color coded, for God's sake.
Okay.
Actually, yeah.
There is one thing that you will be doing.
Apparently, in Indiana, if you don't provide a basketball league, people get very upset.
And quite frankly, throw things at you and call you names.
Like Turd-boy.
Whatever.
The point is I reinstated youth basketball.
Okay?
It says here you only have money for two teams?
Yeah.
They're going to develop a great rivalry.
Under my tutelage, you will grow from boys into men, from men into gladiators, and from gladiators into Swansons.
Behold!
The Swanson Pyramid of Greatness.
I've been developing the Swanson Pyramid of Greatness for years.
It's a perfectly calibrated recipe for maximum personal achievement.
Categories include Capitalism.
God's way of determining who is smart, and who is poor.
Crying.
Acceptable at funerals and the Grand Canyon.
Rage.
Poise.
Property rights.
Fish, for sport only, not for meat.
Fish meat is practically a vegetable.
Haircuts.
There are three acceptable haircuts.
High and tight.
Crew cut.
Buzz cut.
Are the scissors broken in your house, son?
So, are you happy to be back at work?
Well, our budget's been slashed to zero.
I tried to buy fertilizer the other day for the soccer field.
Request denied.
We literally can't buy I'm so sorry.
No.
I mean, look, when we were kids, the Parks Department would do these big projects.
Winter Jamboree, the Harvest Festival.
It's like they don't have faith in us anymore.
I'm not a paper pusher, Ann.
I need to be out in the streets, planting trees and cracking skulls.
Leslie Knope.
Ann Perkins.
How are my two favorite people in this entire town?
Not good, Chris.
There was a whole line of people in my office complaining that all their programs have been slashed.
Yeah, I know, it's terrible.
Is there anything we can do about that?
No.
Damn!
Sorry, Leslie.
Ann, could I talk to you for a minute?
So, how's it going?
Save it.
Okay?
I know you don't have faith in me and my department, and that's fine.
But don't expect me to sit here and chitchat with you.
All right.
Fair enough.
Go the other way.
But I'm just going to that All right, I'II Look.
I'm very flattered.
But again, I don't think I should go out with you.
Can I ask you why not?
Because I thought we had a great time the night you got drunk and kissed me.
And you did use your tongue.
I just don't think I'm in a place to go out with anyone right now.
Okay.
Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me, Ann Perkins.
Leslie Knope.
Yes.
Did he ask you out again?
He did.
He did.
He is nothing if not persistent.
And hot.
He's very He's pretty hot.
Yeah, he's hot.
But he's intense.
But he's really, really hot.
But he's your boss.
Oh, my God.
I just thought of an idea of how we can save the Parks Department.
Great.
Let me ask you one question.
Would you be cool doing things that a prostitute does?
Minus the money?
Definitely yes, then.
Thanks, Ann.
Looking sharp.
Beautiful.
The backboard is your friend.
I'd say my coaching style is centered around fundamentals, with an emphasis on fun.
Hey, watch this.
Go get it.
Yeah!
And a second emphasis on mental.
Yeah, it can be hard work.
But every time I look one of these kids in the eyes and he calls me Coach That's how I know I agreed to be a coach.
Mouse Rat!
Mouse Rat!
Carnage!
- Carnage!
Okay, gentlemen.
It's time for the pre-game coin toss.
There's no coin toss in basketball.
Are those women's sneakers?
Yes, they are, Ron.
You know what?
They fit better, I got an employee discount, and the best part is no one can tell.
All right, let's do this.
Match point.
Touchdown.
Et cetera.
Yeah.
Go, Lightning.
All right.
Okay.
I like what you're wearing, but I need it to be 300% sexier.
Do you have any of those shirts that look wet all the time?
Or, like, a metal bikini?
You know what's always sexy?
Fingerless gloves.
What about if I wear this normal, sane outfit?
Yeah.
Okay, but you're going to have to eat something sexy, then.
Like a banana.
For dinner?
Well, what's sexy food?
Asparagus?
No, you know what's sexy?
Turkey chili.
Yeah.
And how exactly am I supposed to casually steer the conversation towards the Parks Department budget?
Okay.
It's totally easy.
Tell you what.
You be Chris.
I'll be you.
I'll show you how it's done.
Okay.
Ann Perkins.
You are wonderful and amazing and I'm happy to be here with you.
Thank you, Chris.
I'm wearing a tuxedo vest with no shirt on underneath.
Can I get you a drink?
I love every single beverage in the world.
I would like some wine.
And Oops, my vest popped open.
Just like the budget needs to pop open and you need to pour it into my Parks Department.
Great.
I am so excited that you finally agreed to go out with me.
What a magnificent flip-flop.
You're a magnificent asker-outer.
Tell me every single detail of your day.
I love dates.
I love connecting with someone.
I love engaging them.
I love being surprised by them.
I have never had a bad date.
They've all been either great or phenomenally great.
Nurses are the most undervalued members of our society by far.
I think all of you should make as much money as the CEO of Google.
Wow.
Thank you.
I agree.
Can I ask you a question?
Why am I so positive all the time?
Yes, that's exactly the question.
I was born with a blood disorder.
And my parents were told that I had three weeks to live.
And here I still am, some 2,000-odd weeks later, and I have enjoyed every one of them.
I think it's going well.
He's actually a really nice guy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
So, have you asked him yet about the money?
It's a date, you know?
It's kind of hard to casually bring up the Parks budget when you're talking about your favorite movies.
Jurassic Park.
Parks are so great.
The Parks Department needs money.
I just did it in three moves.
Well, then, why don't you just come here and do it yourself?
Okay.
Holy crap!
What?
Chris and Ann, what are you two doing here?
We are on a date.
And it is going phenomenally.
Thanks, but I'll stay for just one drink.
I am so happy I ran into you, because I wanted to speak to you about Well, well, well.
Ben.
What a fun surprise.
That's right, you were coming here tonight on a date.
And hey, Leslie is joining you on this wonderfully romantic occasion.
How about that?
- Fantastic!
It is.
Can I talk to you?
Sure.
What are you doing here?
Just confirming a suspicion I had, Leslie.
What are you talking about?
I had nothing to do with this date.
They're both so beautiful.
They probably just want to see each other naked.
Okay.
Well, I know what you're trying to do, and you're not that good at being sneaky.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not.
I'm great at being sneaky.
- Clearly, you're not.
Hey.
You guys, let's all have dinner together.
The more the merrier.
Great.
Great.
Great job, guys.
Yep.
All right, Eric.
Taking a rest, or are you hurt?
Taking a rest?
Smart.
Destroy them, gentlemen.
Feel no sympathy.
Yes, Ron Swanson is dating my ex-wife, Wendy.
Big deal.
My girlfriend, Lucy, is the sexiest woman in town.
She's Cuban, she's got tattoos, and she's into me, which, as far as I'm concerned, is the sexiest quality a woman can have.
Oh, I have an idea.
You know what would be really fun?
After dinner, we should take a walk by the pond in Ramsett Park.
Walking in parks can be very romantic.
Yeah, too bad the park's always closed, though.
Okay.
Well, you two are on a date.
So, Leslie and I should probably get going.
Well, I'm actually having a good time with everyone.
Chris?
Me, too.
I'm having a fantastic time.
What do you say we take this whole "date-plus-two- other-people" thing up into the stratosphere?
This place is outstanding!
Great call, Leslie Knope.
Thanks.
Look.
Even Ben's dancing.
That's the way to shoot the ball, Chignoli.
Hustle back.
That's a foul!
What?
On whom?
Your team.
Number 50.
He was double dribbling.
He's on defense.
Exactly.
That's a technical difficulty.
So, that means Andy's team throws the ball from the stripey thing.
Let's go!
"The stripey thing"?
Hey, there, how's it going?
Great, thanks.
Can I buy you a drink?
I'm very flattered.
But this is my stunningly gorgeous date, Ann Perkins.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry.
No problem.
In fact, let me buy all of you a drink for being so welcoming today.
Waiter!
I think I may actually like Chris.
On the house, Leslie.
Thank you.
I'm sort of a gay hero.
Last year, I married two penguins at the zoo, and it turned out they were both gay.
Penguin wedding?
Mm-hmm.
That's cute.
It was so cute.
But enough about how cute it was.
Why don't you think I should have the money?
Good Lord.
Really?
Look.
When I was 18 and I became mayor of my hometown, I used every last dollar we had to open a giant winter sports complex.
Called it Ice Town.
And it turned out great and everyone loved it.
Yeah, kind of.
It was never completed, and I got impeached.
The newspaper headline was, "Ice Town Costs Ice Clown His Town Crown".
They were big into rhymes.
Well, I don't know.
I think Ice Town sounds great.
And the point is, at least you tried something.
Foul!
Foul on number three for taking a number two on number four.
Roughing the passer!
Double dribbling!
That's a foul!
That's a foul for touching the basketball.
What are you going to do about it?
Nothing.
You fouled.
You can't do anything.
Okay.
You're ejected.
You're ejected.
What's the matter there, Ron?
No players left?
Andy's team!
Look at them go!
Oh, come on.
Now, you're openly cheering for the other team?
Put my boys back in.
You made me the ref.
Deal with it.
You know what?
Take this uniform off.
Hey!
Hey!
You don't deserve to wear it.
Ron's ejected for molesting the ref!
Yeah?
I'm ejected?
Tom, what are you doing?
- Yes, you are.
I'm ejecting you.
You're ejected, too.
Everyone's ejected.
She's ejected?
Yeah!
Go ahead, go!
Well, that's a forfeit.
Andy's team wins.
No way!
We won?
Oh, man!
Eat it!
Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
- Andy!
Andy!
Andy!
Yeah!
Yes!
I dedicate this victory to April Ludgate.
It feels good.
And it feels sticky.
From the Gatorade.
We're barely able to function.
We could really use that money.
Well, you know, I don't know if it's because I'm in such a good mood or because of the charming Ann Perkins, but I am going to seriously consider that.
Really?
That's great.
Mission accomplished.
Let's boogie.
Mission accomplished?
Yeah.
There's a mission that Ann had thought of.
It was both of our ideas, but it was mostly Ann's.
We I had mentioned to Ann that it would be fun if you two went on a date.
So, then, you could talk about the money, and then, you know, maybe give it to me.
Wow.
I've just had my first bad date.
Ann Perkins.
Not that sneaky.
April!
April!
Where have you been?
Oh, my God.
Hey.
How are you?
I'm okay.
I'm dying to see you.
I called and I texted you, like, a billion times.
I'm sorry.
I was in Venezuela.
Really?
Wow.
Across the pond.
Wow.
I thought maybe I would have heard from you at least once.
Because of what happened.
Ann kissing me?
I am so sorry about that.
It was so stupid and it meant nothing.
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's totally fine.
Hey.
This is my boyfriend, Eduardo.
No, it's not.
That means we're going to lunch.
How do you say, "Have a great time, don't choke on anything"?
Bye.
Leslie asked me to do her a favor.
And I love her, so I did it.
I'm sorry, and I'm here to eat crow.
I like you a lot.
Let's go out again.
Ann Perkins.
Budget solution number 28.
Use grazing sheep to mow grass in parks.
Note.
Tired sheep could become food or sweaters.
Well, I got my answer.
About April.
She hates me.
Yeah.
And she got a boyfriend, I guess.
From some city in Mexico.
So what do I do?
Okay.
Well, when your back's against the wall and odds are stacked against you, you just You You swing the hardest, damn it.
You go big or you go home.
And you don't seem like the kind of guy who goes home.
I'm not.
I don't even really have a home.
Go get her, Andy.
Okay!
Okay, thanks, Leslie.
Okay.
So, we know the people who run this government have no faith in us.
My plan is going to change that and bring the budget back.
And the answer's been right in front of us the whole time.
Check your testicles?
No.
Not that.
Although that is very good advice.
Looking at you, Jerry.
No.
What's going to save us is right there.
Gentlemen, I realize that times are tough and the budget is tight.
But if the people of this town have nothing else to do but sit in their houses and play video games, then Pawnee will die.
And we refuse to let that happen.
Now.
This town was historically known for two things.
Widespread obesity, and the annual Pawnee Harvest Festival.
People from all over Indiana would come and gaze in wonderment at how fat our citizens were.
And while they were here, they would also attend the Festival, a full week of corn mazes, hay rides, Ferris wheels, pumpkins the size ofjeeps.
We lost that festival a few years ago, due to another round of budget cuts.
And I propose we bring the festival back.
With ticket sales and corporate sponsorship, we'll earn all that money back.
And believe me, people will come.
What if they don't?
Well, then you eliminate the Parks Department.
And you guys are all on board with this.
Aye.
- Yes.
Look, we're not just pencil-pushers.
We are a reflection of the community.
And we believe that we can strengthen that community.
Because in the end, the reason why we're all here is to bring people together.
That, literally, is the most moving thing I've ever heard.
And a good idea.
Yeah, all right.
Excellent!
Great!
Okay.
So, everybody, we're going to party hard for 15 minutes and then, we're going to have our first brainstorming session.
Hello, April.
Do you like the flowers?
What are you doing?
All due respect, Eduardo.
You seem like a great guy.
But I like April.
And I'm coming after her with everything I've got.
So, do you want to go out with me?
No.
I thought you were going to say yes.
But that's okay.
Because I'll be back tomorrow to ask you again.
And again the next day.
And the next day.
Not Friday.
I have to go visit my cousin.
But I will be back after that to ask you again.
You should do it.
Follow your dream.
Oh, my God.
Really?
That's awesome.
I'll see you tomorrow.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
There is a crazy flu going around.
Lots of miserable, dehydrated people with high fevers and diarrhea.
And one of those dehydrated, high-fevered, miserable people is April.
Who hates me.
I want another nurse.
Well, there are none.
We're stretched pretty thin right now.
Then, I want a janitor.
They can do what you do, right?
Yep.
Nurses and janitors are totally interchangeable.
Except no one dresses up like a janitor when they want to be slutty.
I get the sense that maybe you're angry at me for kissing Andy.
No, I'm not.
What are you talking about?
That's crazy.
And that you think it might be fun to take it out on me.
Please don't do that.
Do?
I can't do anything.
I'm sick.
My blankets are on the floor.
So, JJ, we wanted to talk to you about the Harvest Festival.
Yeah, I heard you were bringing that back.
Sorry, I haven't been feeling myself.
Well, I'm organizing this huge Harvest Festival and I need at least 80 local businesses to participate.
And normally this is the kind of thing I would love to do.
But, I'm just feeling really tired.
I think maybe my allergies are acting up.
I've already vomited, like, five times today.
We're having a meeting tonight at the Chamber of Commerce and we're going to go over all the details.
And we'd just love if you could come and join us.
Sure.
Anything for my favorite customer.
I bet you say that to all the girls.
Oh, no.
No, actually, you're my favorite.
You spent over $1,000 last year on waffles alone.
Here.
I didn't know what to bring you, so I just got some magazines and lipstick.
Woman stuff.
Thanks.
All my parents got me was that.
Okay, well, I'm not very good at visiting people in hospitals, So I'm going to go.
Hey.
If you see Andy, will you not tell him I'm here?
- Okay.
- Because of what happened, I don't want him to think - Stop!
Don't want to know.
The less I know about other people's affairs, the happier I am.
I'm not interested in caring about people.
I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name.
Best friend I ever had.
We still never talk sometimes.
So, we've developed a revenue sharing formula that will hopefully appeal to most business owners, but Leslie.
Go home.
You're sick.
I'm not sick.
It's just allergies.
Come on, guys.
Just let me in there.
No.
You can't come in here.
You're not coming in.
Leslie, you look tired and you're all sweaty.
You look tired and you're all sweaty all the time.
What's your excuse?
You want to go there, Jerry?
- No.
- Fine, I'm coming in.
Donna, barricade the door now.
Donna, come on.
Just let me in.
Mmm-mmm.
Either go home or go back into quarantine.
I'm not going home.
- Get out of here, Leslie.
- Hit the bricks.
Come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
She's germing up all my stuff.
Aw, yuck!
Leslie!
Ann Perkins.
Hey.
How was your run?
Ended with a five-and-a-half minute mile.
My personal low.
I think the pavement in this town is soft.
What's with the mask?
Flu prevention.
My body is finely-tuned, like a microchip, and the flu is like a grain of sand.
It could literally shut down the entire system.
My body's like a chip, too.
A potato chip.
No.
Speaking of potato chips, you and I are on for dinner tomorrow, yes?
Yes.
Definitely.
I'm super, super excited.
Looking forward to it.
Excellent.
Way to go, buddy.
Way to go.
We've been on a couple of dates.
I really like him.
The problem is he's like a perfect human man.
I can't find one flaw.
There was one time I thought he farted.
But it was me.
I need to find someone to fill in for April.
Now, I know I'm not going to find someone who's both aggressively mean and apathetic.
April really is the whole package.
But I think I might know someone who will be just as ineffective.
Hello, Andrew.
What's new?
A whole lot!
Check this out.
I just invented it.
Super-straw.
So, just sit here and do your thing.
Do I have to tuck my shirt in?
Because, honestly, that's kind of a deal breaker.
Let it fly.
Hey, wait.
Where is April?
- Is she all right?
- Yeah.
I just gave her the day off.
Would it be weird if I asked for the day off?
Yeah, no, it's okay.
I didn't think so.
I'm sorry.
Are you leaving?
I thought we had a meeting.
No, we do.
It's just I think it's a little chilly in here.
Are you okay?
Your eyes are glassy.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my Is she Is she sick?
Are you sick?
No.
Yeah!
She's sick.
That's why I'm wearing this, and misting myself with hand sanitizer.
I am not sick.
I just have allergies, okay?
I took a Claritin and I threw that up, so I took another one.
I threw that up.
And then, I took a third and it stayed down.
I'm getting better.
- All right.
You're burning up.
- You're burning up.
What?
I have to get out of here.
I have 2.8% body fat.
My body is like a microchip.
A grain of sand could destroy it.
My body's a microchip.
- Leslie, go home.
- No, I can't.
I can't go home.
I have to get ready for the Chamber of Secrets.
- Commerce.
- If this meeting does not go perfectly, then the Harvest Festival is going to be over before it begins.
I cannot go home.
Okay, then, who's your doctor?
Ann's my doctor.
And she's the most beautiful nurse in the world.
Come on.
Oh, God.
Now, I'm hot.
Now, it's really hot in here.
Okay, well, that's your fever.
Leslie, I typed your symptoms into the thing up here, and it says you could have" network connectivity problems".
104.1.
Leslie, you're dehydrated.
I'm admitting you.
If I was sick, could I do this?
- What are you doing?
- Cartwheels.
- Am I not doing them?
- No.
Look, don't worry.
I've done presentations like this before, and Tom will be with me.
So, you're in good hands.
It's not that I don't trust Ben.
It's that I don't have faith in Ben.
And, also, I'm starting to forget who Ben is.
I'll handle the general outline.
If you want to - Look.
- just jump right in.
The worst thing you can do with an important presentation like this is over-prepare.
- Well - So, I think it's best if I go to the spa.
No, we promised Leslie we'd prep for the meeting.
No, Ben.
You promised Leslie.
See, I never promise Leslie anything.
That way, I never disappoint her.
I try to be considerate.
Well, I am off for a soak and a schvitz.
Arrivederch.
Ron Swanson's office.
Yes, I will transfer you.
I just dropped another call.
I thought you might like a fresh set of pillows.
Are you trying to smother me?
Help!
This slutty nurse is trying to smother me to death with a pillow!
Okay, never mind.
Stay back, slut!
I know what she's trying to do.
She's trying to get me to break.
And you know what?
I'm not going to do it.
I'm going to be professional and I'm going to put on a happy face.
And then, I'm going to go into a supply closet and snap a bunch of tongue depressors.
Okay.
So, let's talk about your opening remarks.
Do you want me to write you a rap?
I'll write you a rap.
No, you know what?
You're never going to be able to pull it off.
You're too white.
How about a show tune or something?
I was just planning to introduce myself, non-musically, and then, get everyone to refer to their packets.
- And blah, blah, blah.
- No.
No "blah, blah, blah", okay?
You need to go over every single detail with me.
Leslie, I promise you I won't half-ass this.
Okay?
Now, get some rest.
I have some great news.
I think my fever just broke.
Goodbye.
It just came out.
I am starving.
I haven't had lunch since yesterday.
So, I'm going to head over to Callahan's.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go there.
They totally skimp on pickles.
Let me go to Big Head Joe's for you.
They have the most insane burritos.
I don't much go for ethnic food.
No, trust me.
They have one that's called the "Meat Tornado".
It literally killed a guy last year.
You had me at "Meat Tornado".
What are you doing?
Hey.
That flu medicine really helped.
I feel a thousand percent better.
Good as new.
Does this scarf look okay?
I don't want to look stuffy.
But I also don't want to look too "schlubby".
- Get back in that bed.
- So no to the scarf?
Get back in the bed.
No, I'm going to that meeting.
Either you get back in the bed, or I will strap you down.
I've done it before.
Don't test me.
Okay, okay, okay.
Now, what superpower would you rather have?
Would you rather be able to fly or be invisible?
Ed, go first.
Fly, I guess.
I forgot to tell you.
You can only fly five feet above the ground.
I bring a certain panache and spice to the spa experience for these guys.
Before I joined, they were just three old white dudes quietly boiling in hot water.
Would you rather live in the pocket of a giant kangaroo or have a pocket on your own stomach that has a tiny kangaroo in it all the time?
Preston.
Tiny kangaroo in my stomach pocket.
Forgot to mention, the tiny kangaroo is a racist.
- Hey, Ann.
- What happened?
I just saw you a few hours ago, and you were fine.
Not like, "Damn, you're fine," but fine health-wise.
My body has no fat to protect itself from disease.
Things happen very quickly.
Listen to me.
It's very important that you replenish my body with electrolytes after every involuntary loss of bodily fluids.
- Oh, boy.
- My body tends to lose a lot of fluids when it's sick.
My brain is on fire.
I'm dying.
Well, you definitely have the flu.
Oh, my God.
The microchip has been compromised.
Pierre Garcon was a sixth-round pick.
Collie was the fourth round.
Indianapolis Colts know how to draft so well.
They really do.
Andy, this was delicious.
It's awesome, huh?
It's a whole new meat delivery system.
Thank you, son.
What do you say we go out to the parking lot, run a few pass plays to burn off the calories?
You are an unstoppable good idea machine!
I like Andy.
I'm surrounded by a lot of women in this department.
And that includes the men.
Hup, hup, hup!
Peyton Manning reading the defense!
Reggie Wayne, Colts corner!
Andy, wait up!
Hey, April.
I saw that you called for me.
What can I do for you?
I need more flu medicine.
An actual request.
Well, you can't have any.
That stuff is powerful, no extra doses.
I didn't take any.
Leslie came in here and stole it and left.
Leslie?
Leslie!
Hey, have you seen Leslie?
I had a dream that she came into this room, stole my flu medicine, told me not to tell you, and then disappeared through that hole in the wall.
The door?
Maybe we should get, like, a suite here for them, okay?
Ben Wyatt!
Hello!
Hi, Leslie.
- Good to see you.
- You, too.
Wow, you're really burning up.
Can I get some money for the cab that I took over here, please?
Sure.
How much?
I'm not sure.
I looked at the meter, and it had Egyptian hieroglyphics on it.
- Wow.
- Do you know the exchange rate?
So should we do this?
Oh, boy.
Hold on.
- Be careful.
- What?
The floor and the wall just switched.
Okay.
Walk very carefully.
You know, I find it a little insulting that you don't trust me to handle this.
It's not that I don't trust you, okay?
It's just this Harvest Festival is my project.
It's my career on the line.
And I just need to make sure that I've done everything I can to make it work.
Okay.
It's show time.
Okay.
Good evening, everyone.
I'm Leslie Monster.
And this is Nightline.
- Okay, I wouldn't open with that.
- No?
- Why don't we sit down.
Okay?
- Yep.
Libertarianism is all about individual liberty.
And it should never be defined by the terms "liberal" or "conservative".
- And communism is no good, right?
- That's right.
Big swing and a miss.
And what's the word for when a few clerics are in charge?
Religious oligarchy.
Holy I can remember things.
I guess.
Hey, keep mine rare.
A man after my own heart.
I vomited somewhere in this room.
I don't remember where, though.
Wait.
You might want to check that drawer.
Stop pooping.
You have to get up off the floor now.
This floor is my friend.
Nothing like a complete physical breakdown to make a guy seem less intimidating.
I love the flu.
And then I said, "You know what?
"I think we need to get these bananas out of here".
Have a seat, boys.
Oh, hey, Tom, glad you could make it.
You have a nice day with your spa buddies?
Actually, yes, Ben, I did.
And my spa buddies own a couple of car dealerships in town, and they've agreed to donate a fleet of vehicles for Harvest Festival, twenty-five vans for the entire event.
Okay, Tom, I'm ready.
Get up there and introduce me.
You got it.
I can't let you do this, Leslie.
Hey, this ain't your call, McCluskey.
Hey, Ron, can I ask you a question?
Sure.
It's about April.
I don't like to get involved in people's personal I hurt her feelings, and now she's pissed at me.
I feel like if I could just explain myself, she'd understand, but she's avoiding me.
It's making me miserable.
April's in the hospital, sick with the flu.
What?
I knew it!
I didn't know that.
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's fine.
You can go visit her tomorrow morning.
But don't tell her I told you.
I won't.
- No, no, no.
- Nope.
Okay.
Before we get started, a quick announcement.
Every Thursday night is ladies' night down at the Snakehole Lounge over on Burnham Avenue.
Ladies get two drinks for the price of one.
Oh, no, that can't be right.
That's way too good of a deal.
Nope.
That is what it says.
Wow.
That sounds like a fun time.
Anyway, it is now my great honor to welcome to the stage the woman responsible for the entire Harvest Festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, Leslie Knope!
Every one of you, just by showing up here tonight, has already made history.
In days past, the Harvest Festival was the cornerstone of Pawnee's small-business community, a weeklong showcase for everything from textiles to small farms.
By our estimates, as many as 30,000 people might attend the festival, and the monetary value of that kind of direct customer-to-business exposure is, frankly, incalculable.
What?
Three, two, one.
And my shift's over.
What the is your problem?
Whoa, I thought you weren't gonna lose it.
While I was on duty, I didn't.
Now it's just me.
I get that you're mad that I kissed Andy, okay?
But it was a moment of confusion, and it was a mistake.
And I'm very sorry.
You want to hate me forever?
- Okay.
- Fine!
You know what?
I don't care.
But you shouldn't take it out on Andy, because he really likes you, and he did nothing wrong.
And just for the record, I'm starting to hate you, too.
That's the most I've ever liked Ann.
The time is now.
The place is Pawnee.
Let's make history.
- Thank you.
- That was amazing.
That was a flu-ridden Michael Jordan at the '97 NBA finals.
That was Kirk Gibson hobbling up to the plate and hitting a homer off of Dennis Eckersley.
That was That was Leslie Knope.
Thank you so much.
Any questions?
Yes, sir?
Are we going to get the same sales-tax incentives we used to?
That's a very good question, sir, and I would counter with my own question, which is, why is half of your face all swirly?
Okay, unfortunately, Leslie has another very important meeting right now.
So if you have any other questions, you can just direct them towards me.
Give it up, everybody, for Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap.
All right.
Okay, let's Excuse me.
And to answer your question, sir, there will be sales-tax incentives this year.
I think I should drive you to the hospital.
Was I wearing a tiara when I came in here?
Because if you happen upon it, will you have Lady Pennyface retrieve it and send it post-hence?
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, there.
I got you some waffles here, courtesy of JJ's diner, and chicken soup, courtesy of me.
- I'll take the waffles.
Thank you.
- Okay.
So how did the rest of the meeting go?
Well, you said you needed eighty total businesses to participate.
Yeah.
We have 110, and counting.
So, nice work, Leslie.
Nice work to you too.
Left the chicken soup there, just in case.
It's an old family recipe.
It's not a big deal, but - Thank you for that.
- Okay.
Hi, April.
It's me, Andy.
Just stay sleeping.
I am going to be here when you wake up.
I will not leave your side.
You could be asleep for hours.
Maybe I'll come back later.
Hope you feel better.
Okay.
And I know you think that I'm a jerk, but I hope you can forgive me.
Gross.
Your forehead is all sweaty.
That's gross.
But I still like you.
Okay.
That's disgusting.
Got your message.
What's up?
I got a call from the boys upstairs.
And they have a new assignment for us.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
And I feel like we should ask for an extension to stay here.
Yes, definitely.
You know, the festival thing's getting pretty huge, and a couple loose ends that need tying up.
Good, so I'll make the call then, to get the extension?
- Yeah, they need our help.
- For the loose ends.
- Great.
- Good.
Okay, you need a ride back to the office?
No, no, I'm gonna go for a light 15k.
I missed yesterday.
Way to go, buddy.
Way to go.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Okay, Jerry, what have you chosen to put in the time capsule?
These are my mother's diaries.
Wow.
Yeah, she lived in Pawnee all of her life and recorded everything she ever did.
Yeah, so it's, you know, kind of like a living document about the town.
Mmm.
A disappointingly good idea from Jerry.
Better than good, Jerry.
Perfect.
Give me that.
"January 18, 1964.
"Jerrold starred in his school production of Peter Pan.
"He was a beautiful Tinker Bell".
It was an all-boys school.
Jerry!
Hey, Leslie, I have an idea.
Why don't we put Eduardo in there and seal the top so that he suffocates and dies?
Okay, Tom, you're up.
For my item, I chose a picture of my ex-girlfriend Lucy with a mustache drawn on her face and stink lines coming off her, 'cause she stinks.
She broke up with me.
Didn't really tell me why.
Luckily, when you're the guy, you can just tell people she's crazy.
"Hey, Tom, I heard you and Lucy broke up".
"Yeah, man.
Turns out she's crazy".
That's what they always do on Entourage.
Ron?
I am submitting this menu from a Pawnee institution, JJ's diner, home of the world's best breakfast dish, The Four Horse-meals of the Egg-pork-calypse.
Wendy loves it, too.
And I am submitting this.
A brief history of everything that has ever happened since Pawnee was founded.
Not like you get extra credit for this, but I did type it from memory.
And for the first time ever compiled, it includes a complete list of every official town slogan we've ever had.
Oh, my God, Leslie.
- I know.
Can you believe it?
That's crazy.
Isn't it?
The Paris of America".
The Akron of Southwest Indiana".
Welcome, German soldiers".
After the Nazis took France, our mayor kind of panicked.
The factory fire capital of America".
Welcome, Vietnamese soldiers".
Engage with Zorp".
For a brief time in the '70s, our town was taken over by a cult.
Zorp is dead.
Long live Zorp".
It's safe to be here now".
Birthplace of Julia Roberts".
That was a lie, she sued, and so we had to change it.
Home of the world-famous Julia Roberts lawsuit".
Welcome, Taliban soldiers".
And finally, our current slogan.
First in friendship, fourth in obesity".
Yes, Pawnee has had its set of problems, but this time capsule is our way of saying that Pawnee is gonna be around for a long time Capsule.
And you can quote me on that.
I'm actually gonna quote you on all of this, 'cause it's a newspaper article.
I thought of a great headline.
Great.
"It's Time to Encapsulate the Future".
Good one.
Sub headline, "The Parks Department Cuts the Crapsule, Buries the Time Capsule".
I'll be back tomorrow with the photographer.
Okay.
Leslie, this guy's here.
Hi.
Can I help you?
I'm Kelly Larson.
I read online about your time capsule, and I'm here to make a suggestion.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're not taking Twilight books.
It's a beautifully told saga of vampires, werewolves and romance.
You are the person that's been emailing me about Twilight.
I thought you would be younger.
And a girl.
Well, I'm not.
I'm older and a boy.
But I feel very strongly that these should be included.
Can I tell you why?
Sure, Kelly.
Have a seat.
Awesome.
And plead your case.
Thanks.
Okay, Christmas Eve, 1973.
Author Stephenie Meyer, née Morgan, was born in Hartford, Connecticut.
Oh.
You're going all the way back to her birth.
Okay.
So basically, Ann kissed me and then April kissed me, and I told April, because of honesty is important.
That's so true.
But now she's gone and gotten herself a Venezuelan boyfriend who's, like, the handsomest dude I've ever seen.
Present company excluded.
Oh, thank you.
I was talking about me.
Hey.
Ann Perkins!
Andy just gave me a phenomenal shoeshine and I did not know that you two once lived together.
Yes.
Yes, we did.
Thank you for catching him up on our history.
Andy, that was an amazing shoeshine.
I can literally see my face in my shoes.
See you later!
He didn't He didn't pay me.
Why are you hanging out with Chris?
He just sat down.
What am I supposed to do?
He's my boss.
No, he's not.
He isn't?
God dang it.
I cannot figure out who my boss is.
Andy, I like this guy.
Please don't do anything weird, I beg you.
I just started dating Chris, and I don't know how, but Andy's gonna screw it up.
Andy screws everything up.
When we were dating, I bought him a fish and I don't want to get into it, but somehow that fish ended up dead in a cowboy boot.
And combined, they have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide.
Now, have you seen any of the Twilight movies?
No, I have not.
Well, let me describe them to you shot for shot.
Movie number one.
Twilight.
We slowly pan up over a mossy log to see a deer drinking crystal-clear water.
Okay, Kelly, this time capsule isn't just a barrel full of stuff that people like.
It's about life in Pawnee at this moment in time, and there is nothing in Twilight that is specific to Pawnee.
I disagree, okay?
The town of Forks, Washington is exactly like Pawnee, except for the climate and the vampires.
I'm sorry.
I have to say no.
I beg you to reconsider.
And I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Then I'm gonna have to do this.
He brought handcuffs with him.
This whole thing was planned.
I think it's kind of cool.
It's not cool.
It's trespassing, and that is breaking the rules.
Cool people make the rules.
They don't break the rules.
And if those kids want you to break the rules, they're not really your friends.
Whoa, who are you even talking about?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I'm just annoyed.
But while we're on the subject, your friend Orrin, with the long black nails and the cloak?
He concerns me.
He's a genius.
I'll take care of this trespasser.
Give me 30 seconds.
I'm just gonna call security.
Guys, can we push the meeting an hour?
What's going on?
Some guy handcuffed himself to a pipe in my office because we wouldn't put a copy of Twilight in the time capsule.
Damn it.
Again?
You look sad.
You look like a weird goon who's obsessed with a kid's book.
It's a girl, isn't it?
I can tell.
It's the look that Mike had on his face when Bella turned him down for the dance.
Oh, yeah?
Is it?
What look did your mom have on her face when she realized her son was a complete failure?
Okay, I'll be quiet.
But I do know something about heartbreak.
And you know who else does?
Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds?
No.
A little lady named Twilight author Stephenie Meyer.
Trust me.
You should listen to him.
Those books are good.
Oh, I love any book about vampires, werewolves, monsters, zombies, sorcerers, beasties or time-traveling romances.
And if I had an hour alone with Robert Pattinson, he would forget all about Skinnylegs McGee.
I'll tell you that much.
Okay, buddy, time is up.
Give us the keys.
They're hidden somewhere very far away.
Then we're gonna have to cut you loose.
Why?
I'm not doing anything wrong.
Yes, you are.
You're trespassing.
Well, the fact remains this is perfectly legal.
No, it's not.
You're trespassing.
Look, I really don't want to cause any trouble, but I am not gonna leave until you put Twilight in the time capsule.
This muscle-headed Stormtrooper doesn't scare me.
Go ahead, Artie.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Please!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Get him away from me!
I am very scared of you!
All right!
Okay!
All right!
All right!
All right!
Stop.
If he wants to stay in there, I'll let him stay in there.
In two hours, he's gonna be so hungry and freaked out, he's gonna be begging me to He brought a pillow.
Hey, Leslie, I'm making some Sleepytime tea.
Do you want any?
Hey, dude, wake up, man.
Oh, morning, Tom.
Twilight is dope.
I told you.
I couldn't put it down.
It was like she was peering into my soul.
Sing it, friend.
Here.
Book two.
Twilight: New Moon.
Get cracking.
There's a second book?
And a third and a fourth.
No way.
It's fantastic.
Yeah.
I worked really hard.
I did every pair that I could.
I didn't know what to do with these.
I think they're gloves.
No, no, no, no.
Those are sports sandals.
They are for adventure racing.
They perfectly contour to the human foot, and the human foot is the ultimate technology.
Dude, that is the coolest sentence I've ever heard somebody talk.
So you love April, and she has a new boyfriend, right?
You got all of that from a picture?
No, you told me yesterday.
Andy, I want to help you win her over.
Why do I want to help him?
Because he's a good person.
I love good people.
Hey, you know who should wear these shoes?
Monkeys.
Well, this is an interesting turn of events.
Is it?
I don't know.
I mean, I guess it's kind of interesting.
What the real story is is how wonderful our time capsule is and how it perfectly encapsulates, a word I really think you should use, what our town is all about.
Hey, how's this for a headline?
"Parks Department Foiled by Pipe Dreams".
God, that's an amazing headline, but please don't write that story.
The key to April's heart is within you, Andy.
You need to tap in to the aspects of your personality that she once found attractive to make yourself the best version of yourself.
What's great about you?
I'm nice.
Good!
Nice.
What else?
I'm in a band.
Band!
What else?
That's it.
Am I team Edward?
Yes.
Do I share his concerns about turning Bella, though?
Absolutely not.
Edward's primary goal, at all times, is Bella's protection.
Can you please, please be quiet?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Let's keep it down.
Be considerate.
Look at it this way, Tom.
Bella's love for Edward is being tested.
By Jacob?
Mmm.
Not exactly.
The Volturi?
Yes.
Okay, you know what?
All right.
I'm gonna go do my work in the conference room, 'cause you guys are the worst.
You seem tense, Leslie.
You know what you should do?
Read Twilight?
Read Twilight.
Here.
Yeah, thanks.
Sometimes I think she's in the Volturi.
Good morning, Kelly.
Oh, morning, Leslie.
Hope you don't mind, I moved myself over to this pipe.
It's a little more comfortable.
No problem.
Did you have a nice night?
Sleep well?
It was all right, considering.
Picked you up some coffee.
Thank you so much.
Well, you seem pretty chipper this morning.
I am, Kelly, because I know why you're here.
You know what I did last night?
Read Twilight, and it transformed your life and you're gonna put it in the time capsule?
Well, I read the first 10 pages.
I couldn't really get into it, though.
More of a Harry Potter girl myself.
What?
But I looked in the inside cover, and I saw this.
Did a little research, and Liz Waverly is 12 years old, a straight-A student at King Philip Middle.
She's also a member of many Twilight Internet message boards, and I'm guessing your daughter?
Is that why you did this?
To impress your daughter?
Liz's mom and I divorced a couple years ago, and it's been really hard on her.
She loves Twilight.
So, I read about your time capsule and I thought that if I could somehow convince you to get it in there, I'd be a big hero.
That's really sweet.
You should have told me you were doing this for your daughter.
I didn't want to drag her into it.
I'm sorry.
This is a mistake.
You don't have to put Twilight in the time capsule.
I think we should put Twilight in the time capsule.
Leslie, no.
We don't negotiate with weirdoes.
Yeah, what happened to, "A perfect encapsulation of life in Pawnee"?
Well, for that guy, life in Pawnee is him and his daughter reading that book.
Besides, I can get Shauna on board.
It would make a great human interest story.
Uh, if this gets out, every time you want to do anything, some guy's gonna come into your office and handcuff himself to a pipe.
Well, yeah, that's a good point.
Then we shall bring the pipe to them.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
What does that mean?
Crackpot convention.
So that's what today's forum is for.
We're gonna hear suggestions from everyone, and then whichever items we generally agree on will go into the time capsule.
Please remember, this is a government project, so we need to refrain from corporate promotion and religious items.
Who'd like to start?
I think we should put in the Bible.
Great.
Eduardo.
Hi, Eduardo.
I want to apologize.
Just because you're dating my soul mate doesn't give me any right to be a jerk to you.
I promise from now on, I'm just gonna be super nice to you.
Thank you for saying that.
You're welcome.
What CDs are those?
Mouse Rat.
My band.
It's our latest album.
Yeah.
You like music?
What are you listening to?
The Smiths.
Very depressing!
April's making you listen to that?
Mmm.
She's really into that indie stuff.
I'm more of a Dave Matthews guy myself.
David Matthews!
Crash into Me!
Yes!
I love that song.
Here you go, here.
Take one.
Check us out.
We're amazing, so let me know how much you like us.
Yeah, gracias.
That means "thank you"?
Yes.
Nailed it.
So, we have one very moving case for Twilight.
Anyone else?
Great.
Two people for Twilight.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm Marcia Langman, from the Society for Family Stability Foundation.
This book contains pagan creatures and strong sexual overtones.
There are girls quivering.
There are boys staring deeply into girls' eyes as they quiver, and so forth.
There really is a tremendous amount of quivering.
It is anti-Christian, it is pro-quivering, and the government has no business promoting it.
I totally disagree.
Well, now we have two people for Twilight.
Absolutely not.
I'm with the National Civil Liberties Association.
That book actually contains overt Christian themes, and as such, has no business being associated with any government project.
So too Christian, and not Christian enough?
Do you see the irony here?
No?
Okay.
Uh Donna, why don't you put a question mark next to Twilight?
No!
You promised!
You promised?
That's not fair!
Wait, it's not a question of fairness.
It's Go back to Russia, commie!
Hey, you go back to Russia!
You go back to wherever you came from!
Why would I go to Russia?
I have no interest in traveling to Russia.
Can I just say that?
And who else?
I would like to include my favorite book, Crazy from the Heat, the David Lee Roth story.
Well, I think if we're gonna be adding a book to the time capsule, it would probably be Twilight.
I don't care about Twilight.
Why is this only about his favorite book?
I want my favorite book in there.
Okay, I have an idea.
Two time capsules.
One that totally encapsulates what's happening right now in Pawnee in this moment in time and the other one that's just for items of personal significance, like Twilight.
No Twilight!
Yes, Twilight!
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for coming.
I only have a second.
I have to get to work.
Bella's going on her first hunt.
I just don't get why you broke up with me.
Is it 'cause I'm not cool enough?
Like the normal kids compared to the vampires?
Is it an Edward-Bella-Jacob type situation, where you like me but there's someone else you like more?
Uh It's nothing to do with Twilight.
It just didn't work out.
Okay?
Well, what difference does it make?
If we stayed together, you probably would have just dumped me for Ron.
Actually, that's the reason.
I believe you when you say that you're not in love with Wendy anymore, but you're definitely not cool with her dating Ron.
You talk about it constantly.
Well, I can't help it, okay?
I mean, he's so manly, and he's my boss.
Imagine if your boss was Angelina Jolie, and then one day, she just started dating your ex-boyfriend.
Wouldn't that freak you out a little bit?
Well, not if I had a great new boyfriend, dumbass.
Look, Tom, I like you.
You're really cute and you're funny, and you're small enough for me to throw you around.
So if you ever work through this, then give me a call.
My grandmother lived in Pawnee for 60 years, and I wanna put her ashes in the time capsule.
My cat, Turnip, was the greatest cat ever, and I'd like to put his ashes in the time capsule.
For the last time, and I won't say this again, there will be no human or feline ashes in either one of the time capsules.
Except for Turnip!
Except for Turnip!
No chanting.
Look, we don't know what the world is going to be like in 50 years.
We could all have been wiped out from disease or the flu.
So what's your suggestion?
I don't know.
I'm just scared.
Hey.
Aw!
Andy!
I got two microphones, a four-track recorder and every bass tab to Dave Matthews ever.
We're gonna jam for, like, nine hours.
Is that cool?
Yeah.
All right.
That's ridiculous.
Now, why should the Bill of Rights be in the official time capsule, but this painting of my dog is in time capsule seven?
Well, I think pet paintingslashes are in time capsule four.
No, that's baseball cards.
No, baseball cards are in time capsule nine, childhood memorabilia.
Honestly, Twilight could go in almost any of these categories.
Oh, shut up, Kelly!
Make me, Bob!
Okay, let's take a 10-minute break!
Oh, God.
This time capsule's tearing this town apart.
You're leaving soon.
Can I blame it on you in the press?
Sure.
Well, I gotta say, I think it's kind of impressive.
I've been to a lot of towns.
Usually people don't care about anything.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
These people are weirdoes, but they're weirdoes who care.
Excuse me, everyone.
I realize things have gotten a little out of control, and that's Ben's fault, and he's sorry.
But I have an idea, and if you like it, I think we can end this right now.
"Dear Pawnee of the future, "congratulations.
"You have found a time capsule that was buried over 50 years ago.
"We wanted to include a collection of items that would best represent "what life was like in our town at that moment.
"Instead, you'll find only one item, "a video recording of a public forum we held "in order to determine just what those items would be.
"This is truly what life was like.
"A lot of people with a lot of opinions "arguing passionately for what they believed in.
"So enjoy watching it, assuming you still have electricity.
"And sorry about the weird blank gap in the middle.
"A man named Jerry Gergich screwed up the recording somehow.
"He had one job to do.
"Sincerely, Pawnee of the past".
Is Eduardo coming?
No, he went back to Venezuela.
Oh, that sucks.
He was a really good bassist.
I was actually starting to like him.
I know.
That's what made me start to hate him.
Hey.
Nice and band totally worked.
Have you enjoyed your time with Andy?
Yeah, he's great.
And he told me how great you are.
And he told me that I would be crazy to let you get away.
He did, huh?
He did.
And also, there is a pretzel stand over there that serves, literally, the best pretzel I've ever had.
Would you like one?
Absolutely.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Tom.
Tom.
Listen, I've never seen this before, so I'd really appreciate it if no one, like, talked or texted or anything.
Okay.
Ooh!
Hey.
Hey, Leslie, thanks for setting this up.
Dude, what did I just say?
Hey, I was the guy who introduced you to How about you shut up?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Ron?
Jack Cooper, from the Controller's Office.
Got a second?
Sure, what can I do you for?
Frankly, this is a little awkward.
We've received this letter from a collection agency about an outstanding debt from the Pawnee Public Library.
It appears you have an overdue book.
Oh, do I?
Embracing Life with a Micro-Penis.
Tammy.
My ex-wife Tammy likes to check in every so often and make sure I'm doing okay.
And if I am, she tries to everything up.
Okay, I pre-dialed 911, so all you have to do is press send.
You're worrying over nothing.
If she binds your hands and you can't reach your phone, just try to chew yourself free.
Whale tail.
Whale tail.
She's flashing a whale tail.
Abort.
Abort.
Hello, Tammy.
Oh!
Hello, Ron.
I didn't see you come in.
I was just checking myself for scoliosis.
And?
Straight as an arrow.
Just like somebody else I know.
Jerky?
Call off the dogs.
You and I both know that in my entire adult life, I have never checked a book out of the library.
Oh, my God, she's amazing.
Ooh!
Mmm.
I admit there was a time when that sort of behavior would've driven me wild.
But I am in a healthy relationship now, Tammy.
A relationship?
With whom?
A lovely, intelligent, self-possessed pediatric surgeon named Wendy.
Sounds like a real whore.
Clear the late charges and cut the crap.
Good day.
Good day, Leslie.
Good Good day.
Okay, so we're ordering them a total of 30 pizzas, so let's talk toppings.
Sausage, onion, and peppers.
Scientifically proven to be the best toppings.
Nice.
Should we throw in some salads for a healthy option?
Wow, don't be such a Jerry, Ben.
Yeah, Ben, these guys are cops, not ballerinas.
So we are throwing a little shindig for the police department because we're asking them to volunteer as security during the Harvest Festival.
I don't know what it is about big outdoor gatherings that makes everyone want to urinate all over everything, but it does.
And they do.
Okay, how about some calzones?
Calzones are like pizzas but they're harder to eat.
They're dumb, and so was that idea.
Seriously?
This is embarrassing for you.
Sorry to interrupt.
Ron, are you ready?
Absolutely, my dear.
I am off to have a mid-morning pre-lunch with my lady friend, but I will be back in time for lunch.
All right.
Ron's girlfriend's pretty.
Tom's ex-wife.
Oh.
I don't want to see them together.
It's like they're rubbing it in my face.
All I can think about is Captain Mustache plowing my ex-wife.
And you imagine he's wearing a cape while he's plowing her?
What?
No, just, Captain Mustache?
I mean, if all you can think of is Ron, you know Maybe put him in some tights and a cape, and then it would be funny.
Now I'm imagining a cape.
April?
Did you call me?
I did call you.
Good ears.
Chris's assistant went back to Indianapolis, so he's borrowing me for a few days.
Yay!
I'd like you to get me some more Post-its.
I'd like them in multiple colors.
I'd like green.
I'd like yellow.
Do not buy orange.
I do not want orange.
I have plenty of orange.
Got it.
You want five million orange Post-its.
That's hilarious.
Oh, wait!
I have a Post-it for you.
It says, "Great job"!
Mmm Great job.
Mmm There you go.
They're getting really old, and I'm an only child.
I just feel like the right thing to do is to move back home.
I'm sorry to see you go.
I've really come to think of you as a companion.
Hey, I don't suppose you'd want to move to Canada?
Canada.
No, I don't suppose I would.
Hey, I hate to nag, but shouldn't we be talking strategy, like, when to ask the chief for this huge critical favor?
Yes.
I know exactly when we should do it.
Post-pizza, pre-ice cream, between his third and fourth beer.
He'll be full but not stuffed, tipsy but not drunk.
Should be around 9:00.
Okay, so you've thought this through.
Just sit tight.
I'll get you a beer.
Can I have two beers, please?
Hey, you okay?
Wendy and I are over.
She's moving back to Canada.
It's too bad.
I just taught her how to whittle.
She made me this tiny sharpened stick.
Look, I'm gonna tell you what I tell all my girlfriends when they get dumped.
Men are dogs.
Thank you, Leslie.
That does not apply to this situation at all.
But thank you.
I appreciate it.
This is a disaster.
You're not into football?
I knew there was something wrong with you.
I knew it.
I knew it, knew it, knew it.
Honestly, I haven't felt this good in years.
And it's not just because of the supplements he has me taking and the soluble fiber and the increase in regularity.
It's him.
He's moving back to Indianapolis in a couple of weeks, which sucks.
But if he asked me to move with him, I think I would.
I would like a local beer.
I'd like it in a bottle.
I'd like the bottle to be cold.
I would like a glass of white wine.
I would like it to be chardonnay.
And I would like that with one ice cube.
Thanks.
Chief Trumple?
Hey, Knope.
You know Ben Wyatt from the State Budget Office.
Hello.
Yeah, how's it going?
Thanks for the party.
Good pizza.
Great.
So, yeah, the pizza's dynamite, isn't it?
I just said it was good pizza.
It's good.
Pizza's good.
You You know what I like?
Calzones.
What the hell is wrong with this guy?
Sorry.
We'll check in with you later.
Take it easy.
Yeah, will do.
What is wrong with you?
I was getting somewhere with that.
Yeah, great small talk over there.
Okay, let me handle this.
I get a little nervous with cops.
I'm in control.
What's up?
Tom Haverford's in the building.
Whoo!
Tom, what the hell are you doing?
Same thing you're doing, celebrating Pawnee's finest.
I believe you know my date, Tammy Swanson.
Hi-ya, Ron.
Oh.
Hi-ya, Ron.
Hey, Ron.
I'm sorry.
Is seeing your ex-wife on my arm making you uncomfortable?
Gee, I can't imagine why.
Or can I?
I like this song.
Do you wanna dance, Tammy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
Ah.
I know Tammy seems scary.
But really, she's just a manipulative, psychotic, library-book-peddling, sex-crazed she-demon.
Yeah.
I think that's enough.
Tammy.
Hi, Ron.
I was just tasting my new boyfriend, Glenn.
Tom.
You don't know what you're mixed up in, son.
This isn't about you.
It's about me.
Typical Ron Swanson.
Always thinking about yourself.
Maybe we like each other.
Yeah, maybe we do.
Okay.
Let's take it easy.
Tammy, leave him out of this.
So it's okay for you to have a girlfriend, but I'm not supposed to see anybody?
Damn it, woman!
Just crawl back into the dank hole you came from and leave my friends alone.
Okay, okay.
Let's settle down.
What seems to be the problem?
What seems to be the problem?
Is there a problem here?
Basically what we had here was a dispute of a domestic nature.
White male, 40, 45.
Caucasian male.
Stocky build.
Approximately 5'10".
Verbal altercation transpired at approximately 8:55 P.M. with a female unsub.
Appears to be slightly intoxicated.
Claims to be an ex-spouse.
Real piece of work.
Real piece of work.
Real piece of work.
Real piece of work.
I know why you're doing this, and you're making a huge mistake.
Fight fire with fire, Leslie.
He dates my ex, I date his.
Ron and Wendy aren't even dating anymore.
She's moving back to Canada.
What?
Oh, God.
Okay, hey.
What's happening here?
Ron and I are going to get a cup of coffee and talk things out.
It's time for Tammy and me to bury the hatchet once and for all.
Everything will be fine.
It's been like this for hours.
Right there.
Right there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Swanson!
Snap out of it!
Leslie.
Congratulate us.
Ron's got one just like it on his penis.
Oh, yeah.
What the hell happened to you?
Well Here you go.
Rock and roll!
Yeah, baby!
I got it!
You may now kiss the bride.
It's been kind of a crazy night.
Come back, come back.
April, could you come in here a second?
April, way to come in.
Great initiative.
You called me in.
Listen, could you please call Ann Perkins and tell her that I will be unable to enjoy lunch with her today, as I am just swamped.
All day.
Copy that.
Hi, Ann.
This is April.
I'm just calling to let you know that Chris can't make lunch today.
I knew you wouldn't care.
Good-bye.
They started having sex at the court house.
We had no choice.
Oh, well, I completely understand.
Chief, I need to ask you a huge favor.
Leslie.
Ron is a good man who just got caught up in something terrible.
And I was hoping that maybe you would reduce his charges and release him into my custody.
All right.
But keep him away from that crazy librarian.
I'll do my best.
In fact, I don't want him within 500 feet of the library.
That's good advice for all of us.
Nothing but trouble there.
Thanks a lot, bro.
Sorry.
Hey, stop.
Take me back to Tammy.
For the millionth time, no.
That was not the favor we needed to ask for, Leslie.
If we don't get the police for the Harvest Festival, there is no Harvest Festival.
I know.
I'll figure it out later.
Can you turn the radio off?
This is our song.
Your song is Dancing on the Ceiling by Lionel Richie?
Oh, wow, look at that.
You shaved off part of your mustache.
That's lovely.
I didn't shave it off.
It rubbed off.
From friction.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ron Swanson, this is an intervention.
You have been spending the last 24 hours sipping on joy juice and tripping on Tammy.
Well, the people in this room are your methadone.
And we're here to get you clean.
Congratulations!
Holy matrimony, there's the man of the hour.
Jerry, what is this?
That is the set of tumblers that I got from the registry.
This is an intervention.
I thought you said on the phone it was a reception.
Okay.
All right, let's begin.
I would like to address the goofy-Iooking, dirty-kimono-wearing, corn-rowed clown in the room.
If you see Ron Swanson, can you give him this message?
You used to be a man.
You need to get your house in order.
Look, I love you like a brother, but right now, I hate you like my actual brother, LeVondrious, who I hate.
Okay, Tom.
Ron, you look great.
Your skin is glowing.
I've never seen you so happy.
Okay, sit down.
Andy.
Ron, I do not really understand what is going on right now.
But no matter what, you must keep going.
No.
You must stop.
I love you, buddy.
Follow your dreams.
Powerful stuff.
April?
What are you doing here?
I work for your boyfriend.
What are you doing here?
I came to see why Chris stood me up for lunch, but I think I just figured it out.
Because he doesn't like you.
No, I'm pretty sure that's not it.
Actually it's because I didn't call you deliberately.
Which, if you ask me, is a fire-able offense.
So I would tell him that.
Also, he's not into you sexually.
Ann Perkins.
April Ludgate.
Literally two of my favorite people on earth.
I'm sorry that I had to cancel lunch.
Not at all.
It's not a problem.
April here was very apologetic on the phone.
She also sent me flowers.
April.
Nice touch.
Hello, Ron.
It's Ron.
If you're watching this, it means that once again you have danced with the devil.
Right now, you're probably thinking, "Tammy's changed.
We'll be happy together".
But you're only thinking that because she's a monstrous parasite who entered through your privates and lodged herself in your brain.
So you have two choices.
One, get rid of Tammy, or two, lobotomy and castration.
Choose wisely.
You stupid.
This is a waste of time.
You people have no idea what you're talking about.
That was you on the tape.
That was you talking.
Ron?
Ron!
Ron.
There you are.
Ron.
Stop it.
God, please.
Ron, don't do that.
Oh, it's done, Leslie.
Tammy and I are in love, and we're gonna start a family together.
In fact, she's ovulating.
So if you'll excuse us, we're heading off on our honeymoon.
Wow.
Where are you going?
Jerry.
We're gonna spend 11 days in my cabin in the woods.
We bought 10 cases of Gatorade and a Oh, God.
- Give me it.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God.
Ann and I are headed out and I just wanted to thank you for everything today, and I will see you tomorrow.
Hi, Chris.
Ron Swanson has sent me over to deliver to you this document.
"To whom it may concern, dear Chris, "there is an emergency regarding the Parks Department, "and April may just be the only person who can help.
"I can't get into details because it's super-classified.
"Please release April back to us permanently.
"God bless America.
"Love, Bert Macklin, FBI".
What?
Okay.
Well, bye.
April, listen.
If you don't want to work for me, I'm not gonna force you.
You didn't have to do this.
She didn't do that.
That was Dude, I think it sounds like it was Macklin's call.
Look, I get it.
You're young, and trying isn't cool.
But I think you're smart.
I'm gonna be going back to Indianapolis soon, and I think you should come work for me.
Wow, move all the way to Indianapolis, so I can pick up your vitamins and supplements.
Everybody starts somewhere.
You'll travel, and you will meet interesting people.
Think about it.
Okay.
I will.
Apparently he wants April to move to Indianapolis with him.
So that's something.
I hope you're happy.
Look, I just wanted to show him what it felt like to have your ex-wife date someone you know.
Whatever happened after that is not my fault.
Yes, it is.
Tom, you did a really crappy thing, and I think deep down, you know that.
Whatever happens to Ron Swanson is on you.
Excuse me, chief.
Sorry to interrupt.
Hey, calzone boy, what's up?
Well, here's hoping that that nickname doesn't stick.
Right?
But that's not why I'm here.
Leslie Knope asked you for a favor the other day, but the real favor we need is much bigger.
You mean, like calzone size?
Ah!
Sure.
We need the Pawnee police force to volunteer as security during the upcoming Harvest Festival.
Now, the city won't let us throw the festival unless Say no more.
Just send me a schedule of how many officers you need and when.
Really?
Just like that?
Leslie Knope gets as many favors as she needs.
Can I ask why?
Because she's the kind of a person who uses favors to help other people.
And also, my buddy Dave was the crankiest bastard in the department till he started dating Leslie.
So she Okay.
Are they still dating or No.
Moved to San Diego a year ago.
Was it a serious thing, or What do you care?
You a pervert?
Nope, nope.
I'm all good.
Everything's fine.
This is fine.
Don't think I won't do it.
I'll wear this to work.
All right, one more.
What's in here, huh?
A new library card?
Read the name.
"Tammy Swanson Swanson".
You guys, that's amazing.
Well, you about ready to go, my love?
Yeah.
Wait, wait, Ron!
Stop!
Tom?
Jerry, what the hell?
Don't do it.
She doesn't love you.
You don't know what you're talking about.
What are you doing here?
Yes, I do, okay?
When I asked her to be my date, she cackled for a full minute and said, and I quote, "Anything to make Ron miserable".
It's not real, man.
She's just messing with you.
He's lying, Ron.
Stay out of this, Glenn.
It's Tom!
And I'm not lying.
I'm not gonna let you destroy Ron.
You're just gonna have to Ow!
Ow!
He's attacking me, Ron!
Kill him!
Yeah!
Do your worst, Glenn!
You're gonna have to do better than that.
Why are you hitting yourself, Glenn?
Stop hitting yourself.
Tammy, that's enough!
What?
Hey, baby.
You almost had me.
Again.
But seeing you pick on this pathetic, defenseless little man Hey.
reminded me what kind of a monster you are.
You're a joke.
You're not even a man anymore.
Oh, and by the way, last night, I faked four out of the seven.
So did I. Let's go, son.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry about the whole mess.
The crisis has been averted, so let's go talk to the chief.
I already talked to him.
They'll give us the hours we need, no problem.
Great.
What a relief.
Yeah.
Hey, are you hungry?
I haven't eaten.
You know, yeah.
There's a really great calzone place over in "Idiotville".
Oh, really?
Down on "Terrible Idea Avenue".
Okay.
That's weird.
'Cause I thought it was on" Beating-a-Dead-Horse Boulevard".
Calzones are pointless.
They're just pizza that's harder to eat.
No one likes them.
Good day, sir.
Leslie, I You know, I I'm just kidding.
Let's go.
Okay.
That was funny.
High and tight.
Do you think it's gonna leave a scar?
Tom, women like scars.
Shows you survived an attack, and they'll assume the attack was from a man.
Sorry, Ron, about everything.
To true love.
May we both find it.
I'll drink to that.
Nice glasses.
Wedding present from Jerry.
You're not gonna return them?
Nah, too much hassle.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
I found this typewriter next to the courtyard dumpster.
An old Underwood 5 with original carriage return.
Took her home, polished her up and bought a brand new ribbon off of electronicbay.
com.
Okay, somebody has got to do something.
I'm getting a cluster headache.
He's leaving.
Let's go.
I've got to throw it away.
No, I'm not.
It weighs a billion tons.
What is he typing, anyway?
"If you sons of bitches try to remove this typewriter, I'll kill you".
I'm going to type every word I know!
Rectangle.
America.
Megaphone.
Monday.
Butthole.
Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but these interviews are more important than we thought.
Harvest Fest is two weeks away, and awareness is still pretty low.
Boy, 35%?
It's actually 34.2%.
"34.2%".
I'm Ben, the numbers robot.
It's just an exact calculation.
"It's just an exact calculation".
All right.
So, we're doing a huge media blitz to publicize the Harvest Festival, and we've got TV, newspaper, radio And I even called Oprah.
Well, I tried to call Oprah.
I couldn't get her number.
I'm putting it out there, like The Secret.
And hopefully, she'll call me.
Our first interview is at 93.7 F.M. with Crazy Ira and The Douche.
Crazy Ira and The Douche.
They are Pawnee's most hilarious drive time radio guys.
So much better than Tubby Tony and the Papaya.
Am I right?
They're seriously so funny.
Is this right?
This feels almost perfect, but I don't think your core has maximized elasticity.
Okay.
I'll come back, if you guys are being weird.
No, no, no, no, no.
You're exactly the person that I most want to talk to, right at this moment.
And lunge.
Have you given my offer any more thought?
What exactly would happen if I said yes?
Well, you would work at the state house.
You would coordinate my professional and personal schedule, and we would give you a small relocation fee for your move to Indianapolis.
That sounds boring.
But I have nothing keeping me here.
Do you have Internet in your office?
Yes.
Fine, I'll do it.
That is literally the best news that I've heard all day.
Unlike April, I still do not know what my future holds with Chris.
And it's starting to bum me out.
I need some more vitamin D. Yeah.
Hey.
Crazy.
What was that meeting about?
It turns out Chris is my real dad.
I think you're lying.
I think I know what that meeting was about.
You can't go to Indianapolis.
There's got to be something that I can do to convince you how much I care about you.
Tell me your least favorite things you have to do every day, and I'll do them for a month.
Fine.
If you do everything I hate for a month, then I might begin to think about the possibility of thinking about maybe staying.
That's all I have to hear.
You won't live to regret this.
Unless Andy can un-kiss Ann, then I'm not going to change my mind.
But if he wants to take my dumb sister to her dumb dance class, then I'm not going to dumb stop him.
Crazy Ira and The Douche, 93.7.
You know why I'd never be an astronaut?
Two words.
Space farts.
You can't roll down the window of the shuttle.
Am I right, folks?
Houston, we have a What do you think about that, Neil Armstrong?
That's one smallfor man, one giantfor mankind.
All right.
Switching gears here now.
We've got Leslie Knope and Tom "Haverfart" and Ben Wyatt.
And they're in the hizzy to talk about an upcoming event called the Harvest Festival.
Well, The Douche, it's a Pawnee tradition, and it's where fun meets awesome.
Meets agriculture.
And it is going to be next month, right here in Pawnee.
And spoiler alert, it's going to have the best corn maze ever.
You lost your virginity in a corn maze, didn't you, Douche?
That's right.
To your mom.
Crazy Ira!
Clean your room!
There's also going to be hay rides.
"Hey, ride me," is what Crazy Ira's mom said.
Stop it!
China Joe, you are a poet.
My bird is missing.
I need a permit to post signs.
Let me just look for that form.
There's no time!
He can fly!
Nine things April hates to do.
Number one, run the permits desk for an hour.
That's no problem.
I eat "running the permits desk for an hour" for breakfast.
Ow.
That's Ow.
Henry.
Stop it.
Great.
Ow.
Okay, Henry.
Cute kid.
Andy.
Got a sec?
Yeah.
Henry.
Why are you working the permits desk, and why was that child clubbing your nuggets?
I'm trying to stop April from taking a job with Chris, so I'm doing everything she hates doing for the next month.
That's going to work?
She said it might.
But it's all I've got, man.
Give me the list.
I'll help you.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
You got it.
No, I don't care about their relationship.
I just don't want to lose April.
I would never be able to find a worse assistant.
Okay.
Thanks, Leslie.
But you know, what we really want to do today is have a chat with Ben Wyatt, here.
Come on, Ben.
Come on, Ben.
I'm more of a behind-the-scenes kind of guy.
Well, it's either come with us or get in the spank chair.
So, maybe it's time for an interview.
Come on, everybody, give him a hand.
Come on!
Come on over, Ben.
Yeah.
So, this guy, Ben Wyatt We're looking him up on AltaVista.
He's from some hick town, Partridge, Minnesota.
And when he's 18, he's elected mayor.
That's funny.
That's funny.
Yeah, he's 18, becomes the mayor, and then blows the whole budget on an ice skating rink.
City goes bankrupt.
Joke!
Get out of there!
What did you call it again, bro?
What was it called?
Say it.
Ice Town.
I was a kid.
And when you You end up getting out there and there's a I really wish you guys could see this guy right now.
He is drenched in sweat.
There's also going to be ponies at the Harvest Festival.
All right.
Let's take a caller from Douche Nation.
All right.
Talk to me, caller.
What's up, guys?
Just douching over here in Eagleton.
Sweet.
Seems like 18 is pretty young for a mayor.
What were you, like, 12?
The funny When I guess The fortunate Can we just, sort of Game over, man.
Game over.
Nice job, man.
Was that your first time talking to other people?
Because it came off that way.
You embarrassed me in front of The Douche.
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just I haven't had to deal with that mayor stuff for 17 years.
I guess I'm not totally over it.
No worries.
Look, it was just a bump in the road.
Okay.
Fortunately, the Leslie-mobile is an all-terrain vehicle.
So, everything involving Ben is fine.
I just need to talk to you in private about something different that is not Ben-related.
Ben, good job.
Your boy's a nightmare.
I know, but we need him.
If they ask us about the budget, he's our numbers guy.
Well, we should just slap a pair of Ray-Bans on a calculator, because that would be way more charming.
I'll do the newspaper interview.
You and Ben do Channel Four.
Perd Hapley is a big softie.
It'll be a puff piece.
He can do it.
So, how are you liking Pawnee?
There are a lot of cars.
I mean, not too many.
Trucks and stuff.
But, you know Cool.
Good talk, Ice Town.
Okay.
Wow.
Who knew that watercress, garbanzo beans and walnuts could complement each other so well?
Good dressing, too, right?
Flaxseed and agave.
Same basic ingredients as bird feed.
I'm just going to come right out and say it.
I want to define your bagua.
Okay.
What's that?
It's a feng shui term.
The energy in this house is a little stale.
But I think I can redefine your flow in a very positive way.
Great.
I'm not really attached to the way this stuff is arranged.
Or the stuff itself.
Or this house, even, really.
Great, let's do it.
Am I not being obvious enough?
I feel like I'm being obvious.
This just in.
Harvest Festival more like "Harvest Bestival".
The Parks Department has planted the seeds, and now, they're harvesting the rewards.
Great.
You done?
They'll put the fun in funnel cake.
Okay.
Now, I'm done.
Tell me about Ben Wyatt.
Sure.
He works for the state government, and he's been coming to advise us about our budget.
Come on, Leslie.
The Douche blew this story wide open.
Ben Wyatt bankrupts a town and then comes to Pawnee to tell us how to spend our money?
There's no story here, Shauna.
He's just a dedicated civil servant who is doing whatever he can to make sure that this is the best Harvest Festival ever.
And he's easy on the eyes, too.
What exactly is the nature of your relationship with him?
Strictly professional.
Just friends.
So, are you colleagues or are you friends?
We are colleagues with benefits.
We're colleagues who benefit from the fact that we're also friends.
I'm sorry, Shauna.
I think I need to go.
But, thank you so much, and as always, everything I said is off the record.
Okay?
Bye.
What's the next task?
We have to write her grandmother a thank you note for a birthday check.
It has to be really good, too, because it's five months late.
Never written a thank you note before.
This will be fun.
What does she call her?
Gamma.
No.
Nanna.
Or Nana.
Gizmo.
Something like that.
This is for your Gizmo.
I think you'll find it's pretty good.
"Dear April's grandmother" I said grandfather.
Oops.
Okay.
"You are a beautiful and amazing woman".
Man.
"I hope someday, I can become half the woman you are".
He's a man.
"Thank you for the $500".
It was $5.
"Enjoy the Mouse Rat CD".
He is deaf.
Okay.
Do you want me to make those changes, or is it good?
Before we do this next interview, there's a little secret I want to let you in on.
It's called the "Haverford Schmooze".
Look, I was just caught off guard.
I'm fine.
Three easy steps.
Smile, friendly physical contact and flattery.
"Hey, Perd.
Was your dad RoboCop?
Because your arms are guns".
RoboCop didn't have guns for arms.
Oh, my God.
That's so not the point, you nerd.
Just saying.
Why are we at a mall?
We're getting you a new suit.
I've let this go on long enough.
I like this suit.
You shouldn't, because it looks like garbage.
Your suit looks more like garbage.
Really?
Yeah.
Because Brooks Brothers Boys doesn't make garbage.
Okay.
This next thing is a photography class assignment.
Can you figure that out?
"Encapsulate the spirit of melancholy".
Melancholy.
Easy.
Boom.
A sad desk.
Boom.
Sad wall.
It's art.
Anything is anything.
Right on.
I'm going to go drop this off and pick up the mail.
Sad floor.
It does look sad, kind of.
Sorry for stepping on you, floor.
Hey.
You got Andy doing all your work for you?
Yes, but he said he wanted to do it.
I'm only doing it because I'm getting him back Yeah, I don't care.
I got something to add to your list.
Yup.
There we go.
That's the stuff.
April really does this every day?
Yes.
Work the heel.
Andy, can I be next?
Yeah.
I have got a corn so big you could slap butter on it.
Welcome to Ya' Heard?
With Perd.
I'm Perd Hapley.
The story of our guests today is that they are from the Department of Parks and Recreation.
Ben Wyatt and Tom Haverford.
What up, Perd?
Big fan.
Me, too, Perd.
What up?
The thing about this first question is, I'd like to ask you about the Harvest Festival.
Perd, it's going to be amazing.
Carnival rides, games Sweetums is even building a plus-sized roller coaster for some of Pawnee's obese thrill-seekers.
You must be this wide to ride.
Wow.
That's going to be a pretty big roller coaster.
Yup.
Hey, guys.
How did it go?
Well, there were some sticky moments.
Let's go to the videotape.
Look.
Who hasn't had gay thoughts?
Who?
- Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I mean, you know, sometimes, I feel like I might need glasses.
Is there a bird in here?
I swear, I keep seeing a bird in this studio.
Maybe that's all there is to it.
How did this happen?
He was fine until Perd started asking him about the "boy mayor" stuff.
What's wrong with you?
You look psychotic.
I was 18 when I was elected mayor.
Okay?
So, excuse me for that.
Cindy Eckert had just turned me down for senior prom.
Do you know how that I should call her.
I should.
No, I shouldn't.
And I'm not going to.
And I'm proud of myself for that.
And then, he talked about feeling up Cindy Eckert for the first time for about five minutes.
And then, the show ended.
As did our careers and, probably, Harvest Fest.
Boom.
Sadness.
That's the one.
Natalie!
Hey.
It's me, Andy.
You're an hour and a half late.
I know.
I know.
I had to massage a ton of feet.
Super sorry.
Come on.
Get in.
I need to do everything on April's list or she's not going to go out with me.
You're into April?
Come on.
We'll talk about it in the car.
Hold on.
I'll get my books.
Okay.
Okay, great.
Call me.
That should be some damage control.
I'm having dinner with Perd Hapley.
Tom, what do we have?
I've gotten calls from a dozen businesses thinking about pulling their sponsorships.
Sweetums might cancel the Fat-Coaster.
Oh, my God.
Okay, look, we need to focus.
We still have the Pawnee Today interview.
Well, is it too late to cancel?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's too late to cancel.
Joan Callamezzo runs this town.
But Ben, don't worry about it.
You're not going in front of the camera.
Fine with me.
Are you trying to lure this young lady into your van?
Yeah.
But she's being really difficult about it, and it's actually not my van.
I stole it from a friend of mine.
I technically shouldn't be even driving, because my license is crazy expired.
That's Dwyer.
D-W-Y-E-R.
Dude!
Come on.
I've got to get out of here!
Natalie, tell this guy you know me.
Joan?
I thought you were Jennifer Aniston filming a movie here.
Joan, let's make a pact, okay?
If we're both still single in an hour, let's get married.
Tom, I'm already married.
That's right.
To Seal.
What?
I confused you with Heidi Klum again.
See you later, Joan.
That's just That's how it's done.
- In five, four Hello, and welcome to Pawnee Today.
I'm Joan Callamezzo.
Today's guest is Leslie Knope, who is here to tell us how this year's Harvest Festival is going to bankrupt the city.
Well, Joan, actually, there's a lot of false information flying around.
The Harvest Festival is Jumping right in.
That's rude.
I just want everyone to know what an extraordinary event this is going to be.
But at what cost?
How many cities does Ben Wyatt need to destroy before he's put behind bars?
Ben Wyatt has done nothing wrong.
You know?
If you want to ask him questions, let's go for it, huh?
Just ask any question about his past or present.
Just get it over with.
Ben, let's get up here.
What?
Yeah.
Come on.
We'll just ask him a bunch of questions, and then, we'll get everything cleared and out of the way.
Sound good?
Yeah?
Great.
Good.
Let's take some calls, Joan.
Why don't you?
Okay.
Caller, are you there?
Yeah, how can you justify raising taxes for something that will hurt the town?
I For Just to add to what Ben's stammering about, we aren't going to raise taxes.
So, that's that.
Next caller?
Do you fish, April?
No.
Fish are gross.
Let me give you a piece of fishing advice.
I said I don't When you have a fish on the line, you don't just drag it behind the boat.
You either reel it in or you cut him loose.
Especially if he's a nice fish with a big, lovable fish heart.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe not.
Maybe you really do hate Andy.
Maybe moving to Indianapolis just to get revenge on him is a really good idea.
What do I know?
You are going to love this.
Verosian tea really supercharges the bacteria in your colon.
Plus, it smells interesting.
Waft it.
Are we actually ever going to drink it, or we're just going to sniff it?
I love sniffing.
Don't get me wrong.
You are hilarious.
So, you're leaving soon.
Back to Indianapolis briefly, and then, on to a town called Snerling, Indiana, for several months.
Never heard of it.
It's quite small.
The cows outnumber the people forty to one.
It sounds amazing.
I like you a lot.
I love spending time with you.
And I thoroughly enjoy you, Ann Perkins.
I just think we need to talk about what that means for us.
I don't want to be clingy.
No, no, no.
Please.
It is something that we need to figure out, and we should do that right now.
I'm so happy you said that.
Wow, that's disgusting.
Yes, it's very hard to drink.
Yeah, why should we trust this Ben Wyatt guy?
Because I'm trusty.
Trust me.
I'm trustworthy.
And I am working very hard to make sure that this town gets back on its feet.
Here we go.
Okay, great.
Next caller?
So, I looked you up on AltaVista, and I found out that the last seven towns you've gone to ended up bankrupt.
Okay.
First of all, why does everyone in this town use AltaVista?
Is it 1997?
And second, I am a budget specialist.
I went to those towns because they were bankrupt, and now, they aren't.
And yeah, I screwed up when I was 18, but who doesn't do dumb stuff when they're 18?
Joan?
I stole my gym teacher's husband.
So, there you go.
Well.
What else you got, callers?
Going once, going Here we go.
Yeah, hi.
Can you tell me more about the corn maze at the Harvest Festival?
Are dogs allowed?
Hello.
Hello.
How did it go today?
It was super fun.
It was?
Yeah.
You have a list for tomorrow?
You want to do this again tomorrow?
Yes, I do.
I mean, it's the deal, right?
I got to do it for a whole month, and then, you're not going to move to Indianapolis.
I better be the only person you kissed today.
Yeah, I'm positive that you are.
If I thought you were serious, I'd be offended, Perd.
But I know that we're buddies.
And I know you wouldn't do that to me.
But, no, this is a birthmark, Perd.
Okay?
This is the little scar I got when I was nine and I fell off my bike.
So, no, I'm not perfect.
I can't look away.
It's amazing.
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait.
Now, here's the best part.
Okay, that's all the time we have here on Ya' Heard?
I'm Perd Hapley, Channel Four.
More like "Turd Crapley".
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah?
Bravo!
Thank you very much.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Now, after we are given the certificate, who do you think should speak first?
I think it should be me and then you.
But, if you want, it could be you and then me.
Or it could go me, you, me.
What do you think?
How about just you?
Thank you, Ron.
Yes.
Tomorrow, the Parks and Rec Department is receiving a commendation at the Indiana Statehouse for bringing the Harvest Festival back.
And although it's purely ceremonial, it's a huge deal for me to go to the Statehouse.
I couldn't care less about the commendation.
But Indianapolis is home to Charles Mulligan's Steakhouse, the best damn steakhouse in the damn state.
I have taken a picture of every steak I've ever eaten there.
June 2004.
Porterhouse, medium rare, Béarnaise sauce.
January 2000.
They call this one "The Enforcer".
February '96.
The steak, rib eye.
The whiskey, Lagavulin 16.
The lady next to me, a bitch.
Specifically, my ex-wife, Tammy.
Okay, this is the first time I ever went there.
Oh, look at me.
I'm just a kid.
She's showing some elephant Ooh, la la.
Look who's fancy.
Am I wearing an ascot?
I didn't notice.
Big night at the Snakehole Lounge!
It's a launch party for Dennis Feinstein's new fragrance, Allergic for Men.
Pawnee's own Dennis Feinstein is a real up-and-comer in the world of micro-brewed perfumes and body sprays.
His ether-based perfume, Blackout, was named one of Maxim's top hundred ways to trick someone into sex.
Club opens at 6:00, event starts at 9:00.
No, no, way too late.
I will be deep into my bath by then.
Don't let us picture that.
Ben, you gonna go?
I don't think so.
Probably just gonna take it easy, but thank you.
Yeah, they always ask me to go out with them.
They're just being polite.
I move around a lot, so the friends I make in these cities, they're like Facebook friends, you know?
"Hey, Doug from Bloomington is thinking about buying a shirt".
Come on, Doug, who cares?
Okay, Tom, I want you to take Ben and make him go to that antihistamine party.
It's "Allergic," and forget it.
He doesn't know anybody in town.
Come on, Tom, take him under your tiny little wing.
He's a fully grown man, Leslie.
And tonight's just not about pleasure.
I'm schmoozing Dennis Feinstein so I can pitch him my new cologne, Tommy Fresh.
Okay, well, while you're doing that, I want you to picture Ben in his motel room, all by himself with no friends, staring at the wall.
Deal.
Tom.
So my band's working on a new album.
Oh, yeah?
What's it called?
April Ludgate is the Best Ever, Volume One.
Shut up.
So, what do you wanna do tonight?
We could watch TV at Burly's house or we could watch TV at your house.
Or, I mean, we could watch TV at Best Buy.
Why don't we go to Tom's thing?
That weird cologne party thing at the Snakehole?
I kind of forgot that you need money when you have a girlfriend.
I wanna treat April like a queen, and queens deserve flowers and massages, chocolate, booze, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, them treasure chests full of scarves, different kinds of lubes that warm up when you rub 'em on stuff.
I'm gonna give her all that stuff.
And more.
That sounds pretty awesome.
Yeah, let's do it.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
I don't know.
I guess we're dating.
It's new.
Whatever!
I don't like labels.
Go away.
This?
That would be good.
But does it say, "Hello, general assembly, "I've come to Indianapolis to accept your commendation"?
As much as any one dress could.
Leslie, I think Chris is cheating on me.
What?
That lying bastard!
Wait.
How do you know?
I don't have any actual proof.
Then I'm sure he's not cheating on you.
And if he is, he's a monster.
And if he's not, you guys are great together.
But if he is, I will kill him.
Well, we had a really good conversation about our relationship last week, and he was very reassuring that we're headed in a good direction.
Great.
But then he got distant.
And when I asked to come visit him in Indianapolis, he was totally weird.
He was weird.
Look, it sounds like you're just spiraling.
But what if I'm not?
What if I'm not?
What if he has a girl up there?
I think he's cheating on me.
Wow.
Okay.
Well, luckily, I'm heading up there.
I'll invite him out to dinner and I'll poke around a little bit.
Okay.
I mean, he's not gonna be able to keep anything from me.
In high school, they used to call me Angela Lansbury.
But that was because of my haircut.
Hey, champ.
Hey, champion.
Listen, you should come out tonight.
Club's gonna be dope.
Plus, I'm pretty sure you have nothing else going on.
Well, that's not totally true.
The owner of the motel I'm staying at said she was gonna screen Hope Floats in the lobby.
Asked me if I wanted to watch.
Yeah.
You should probably get out of that.
I think she's gonna murder you.
Come on down to the Snakehole.
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
Okay.
Yeah, no, I'll stop by.
Cool.
Thank you.
Hey, you mind if I ask?
What are you gonna wear tonight?
You know, I was probably just gonna stick with this.
Come on, seriously.
What are you gonna wear?
Something totally different.
Probably go home and grab something.
Cool.
If you would be willing to just take a brief pit stop, we could see Indiana's second-largest rocking chair.
No.
Then maybe we should take a quick two-hour sojourn to Dame Gervin's Misshapen Celebrity Castle.
It's where Madame Tussaud sends all of its failed wax figures, and if you can figure out who it is, you get to take it home.
No.
What's wrong with you, grouchy pants?
I've been fasting all day to save room for Mulligan's.
Fasting's not healthy for you, Ron.
Leslie, you need to understand, we are heading for the most special place on earth.
When I'm done eating a Mulligan's meal, for weeks afterwards, there are flecks of meat in my mustache, and I refuse to clean it because, every now and then, a piece of meat will fall into my mouth.
I forgot to tell you, Chris Traeger is joining us for dinner tonight.
Please tell me he's meeting us at the restaurant.
No, we are picking him up.
Damn it, woman!
Welcome.
I am so glad you guys called.
This is gonna be great.
Come on in, come on in.
Sure.
Or we could just Wow!
Look at your foyer.
It's like a spa in here.
Exactly.
The entranceway to your house sends a message to the world about who you are.
And the front door provides energy flow and opportunity.
You cannot limit that.
Yeah.
Ron doesn't even have a front door.
He won't even tell me his address.
Ask him where he lives.
Where do you live?
Why?
So this is some kind of coat closet or something?
Wow, there's a lot of men's coats in here.
I like coats.
Could I use your bathroom really quick?
It's right behind you.
Okay.
Toilet seat's up.
Hey, let me get a beer and a Pawnee Sunrise.
Do you wanna pay cash or start a tab?
I It's okay I know Tom.
Tom who?
Tom Hammen Hammenstein.
Haverford.
Haverford.
He's, like, my best friend.
Hey, Freddy, this guy says he knows Tom and wants a drink for free.
You got money to pay for those drinks?
Yes.
No.
Make room for the paying customers, huh?
Let's go, Knope!
Just one second.
Hey, what's up?
Hey, I think you might be right.
I found a woman's razor in Chris's shower and a pink swimming cap.
Are you serious?
What the hell?
You know, it could be nothing, but it feels like something.
I don't I'm coming up there.
Wait.
All right, okay.
All right, let's go.
Oh, my God.
They just forgot to unlock the door, that's all.
Ron, it looks like they're closed for some kind of health code violation.
Ron, stop it!
Ron?
They just boarded her up like she was some common warehouse.
I should have been here.
What happened to the steaks that were in there when they closed?
Do you think they got eaten?
Why don't we go back to my place and I'll fire up the grill?
You sure you're not expecting company or something?
No.
What do you say, Ron?
Go back to my place, I'll make you some grub?
It'll be just as good as it would've been here.
Okay.
Okay.
That man is a legend.
Think about all the scents he's created.
Attack, Yearning, Thickening, Itch, Coma, Sideboob.
Dennis Feinstein, though?
I don't know.
He should probably change his name to something a little more exotic if he wants to make it big in perfume.
Oh, his real name is Dante Fiero, but he changed it to Dennis Feinstein 'cause that's way more exotic in Pawnee.
Okay.
So what's your plan?
Wait till he's alone, then I'll walk up and spray him with Tommy Fresh, and I say, " Uh-oh.
"Looks like you just inhaled your future".
Yeah.
That might actually work.
Is everything okay?
It kind of sucks that I'm super broke and I wanna buy you stuff and it's embarrassing that I can't, but I'm broke too, and I don't want anything.
I just wanna hang out with you.
Plus, I can get free drinks any time I want.
How?
I'm a girl in a sleazy club.
Hey.
Hey.
I hate drinking alone.
Can I get you a drink?
Sure.
Triple whiskey.
What's your name?
Oprah.
I'm Kevin.
Cool.
I kind of wanna drink alone.
But I said I wanna drink alone.
Thanks.
Bye.
Here.
You take this one.
I will get myself a martini from that idiot.
So, Chris, do you have any sisters?
No, I don't, Leslie.
Do you have sisters?
Maybe.
So how's your mom?
Is she visiting?
No, she's home up in Wisconsin.
Is your mom visiting?
Any aunts?
Nope.
You have aunts?
Girl cousins?
A youthful grandmother, perhaps?
Nope.
Did you forget how to have a conversation?
I am so happy you guys are here.
I'm gonna go fire up the grill.
I'm gonna kill him, Ron.
Why?
Chris is cheating on Ann.
There's evidence everywhere.
She's coming up here so they can have it out.
Ask her to bring some garlic salt.
I'm worried Chris doesn't have any.
I got this from a waiter.
I told him I had a pork deficiency.
Sweet!
Pigs in a blanket.
I always wondered why they call them that.
Look what I got.
Look what I got from the bathroom.
Mints.
Six of 'em.
Nice.
Yeah.
Okay, whoever gets the most free stuff by the end of the night wins.
Deal.
Go!
Ron, would you like some salad?
Since I am not a rabbit, no, I do not.
Try it.
Salad's good for you.
You got it.
Mmm.
Delicious.
So, Chris, what do you do up here in your spare time?
Well, I exercise, and I exercise my mind.
And I try to keep up on current events.
Oh, that's what you call it.
Sorry?
How are things going with Ann?
You know what's funny about Ann?
She's my best friend, and anyone who hurt her is someone I would murder, probably.
Oh, is that what's upsetting you?
This is very uncomfortable for me.
I don't know what to say.
Watch the master work it.
I'm the Yoda of networking.
Well, Yoda wouldn't actually need networking.
I mean, his powers were more spiritual.
Shut up, you nerd!
I get it.
Okay.
Mr. Feinstein, Tom Haverford.
I'm the organizer of this soiree and I'm also a huge fan of yours.
I use all your colognes.
Sometimes two at once!
I don't recommend that.
Are you from the FDA?
You know, legally, if you're from the FDA, you have to tell me.
I wanted to talk to you because I actually created my own scent.
Great.
I'd love to smell it, right?
I know you're a busy guy.
Yeah, man.
I'm crazy busy.
But all day long, people are pitching me colognes.
That guy just pitched me a cologne called Sluts.
I'm gonna tell you what I told him.
Not just anybody can do this.
Although it's a great name, and I'm probably gonna steal it.
Please, it'll take two seconds.
If you like it, maybe we go into business together, branch out in other states, move over to watches and fancy raincoats, open up stores in London and Paris.
I don't know.
I haven't thought it through.
But for now, I want to present Tommy Fresh.
All right, I get it.
It's a gag scent.
Hilarious!
As in, "It's hilarious how awesome it is"?
It smells like somebody spilled Chinese food in a bird cage.
Horrible!
It's assaultive.
It takes everything in my power to not retch right now.
Kid, you need to find another game.
Leave perfumery to the real men.
Hey, Ann, if you get this, I don't know if you should come up here.
He's not worth it, okay?
Call me, let me know where you are, and if you have Ron?
What in the devil's name is this?
Portobello mushrooms.
Where's the steak?
There's no steak.
That's a healthier option.
It's organically grown.
Lord.
Ron, are you okay?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.
Could you get us a cold compress or something?
Hey, six beers for table 12.
Do you work here?
Yeah.
My dad owns this place.
I'm Janet.
Janet Snakehole.
Hey!
This round's on the house!
All right!
How about some tips?
Gum or mint, sir?
Gum.
Then a mint, I guess.
All out, sir.
Don't have those either, sir.
Do you have anything?
Out of everything, sir.
This is so awesome!
We are like Robin Hood.
We steal from the club and we give to ourselves.
Look, we'll find a 24-hour diner.
Or we can get one of those cows that we saw on the way up here and we'll bring it back and we'll make steaks out of that.
Ann Perkins, what are you doing here?
Whose pink razor's in your shower?
Excuse me?
Leslie found a pink razor and a pink swimming cap in your shower.
Whose is it?
I guess you're talking about my razor.
I shave my legs for swimming, and women's razors work better.
For whatever reason, men's razor technology hasn't figured out how to properly contour the shinbone.
And the swimming cap?
Indiana Breast Cancer Awareness Triathlon, 2009.
Came in fourth!
Well, I found concealer in your medicine cabinet.
What's that about?
I'm a human being.
Sometimes I get blemishes.
I'm not perfect.
Oh, God.
I am so sorry, honey.
I'm so embarrassed.
I was scared that you were cheating on me.
No, I'm not cheating on you.
But I'm also not dating you.
We broke up last week.
We talked at your house.
Do you not remember this?
Of course I remember, but we didn't break up.
I'm sorry, Ann, but I'm certain we did.
Okay, you said that you didn't wanna leave Pawnee and that I was the most amazing woman you had ever met.
Which you are.
And then I said that I would move to Indianapolis if I had to, and you said you didn't wanna make me do that, and then you said that in a different world Oh, my God.
You broke up with me.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, so here's what happened.
Sweet and beautiful Ann has never been dumped before, and Chris is such a positive person, when he broke up with her, she just didn't realize it.
It's kind of understandable.
Although it does kind of make you wonder how good of a nurse she is.
Oh, my God.
You left, and you said you were gonna work late, and I kissed you?
As enjoyable as that was, I did find it odd.
And then I wanted you to meet my parents?
I'm sure they're great people, but strange.
This is humiliating.
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
Hey Hey, man.
I got you another melon-tini.
Thanks.
Listen, that guy is a jerk, and if you ask me, he smells like Success!
He smells like success.
You know what I smell like?
A teriyaki hairpiece?
I smell like the guy who's always coming up short.
And you know what?
I'm just sick of it.
Tommy Fresh was my dream.
Now no one's ever gonna smell it but me.
I can smell your dreams, Tom.
I can.
And I can smell 'em from here.
And honestly, they smell terrible.
But I like Tom.
I've got a jar of olives.
Nice.
A thing of toothpicks that look like swords.
And a year's supply of toilet paper.
I got Boom!
$38 in tips.
$180.
We should give it back.
We should give it back.
Follow me.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Wow.
Thank you.
One time, when I was in high school, a guy's mom called me and broke up with me for him.
There was another time where I was on a date and I tripped and broke my kneecap.
And then the guy said he wasn't "feeling it," so he left and I waited for an ambulance.
One time I was dating this guy for a while, and then he got down on one knee and he begged me to never call him again.
One guy broke up with me while we were in the shower together.
Skywriting isn't always positive.
Another time, a guy invited me to a beautiful picnic with wine and flowers, and then, when I tried to sit down, he said, "Don't eat anything.
Rebecca's coming".
And then he broke up with me.
Who was Rebecca?
Yeah.
Exactly.
Thanks for driving me.
Wait.
You're getting your commendation tomorrow at the Statehouse.
Oh, please.
It's just a goofy ceremony.
I don't even care about it.
Leslie.
Besides, Ron is staying behind.
He'll go.
Is Ron gonna be okay?
I honestly don't know.
This isn't a steak.
Why would you call it that on your menu?
I don't know what to tell you, man.
Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have.
Wait, wait.
I worry what you just heard was, "Give me a lot of bacon and eggs".
What I said was, "Give me all the bacon and eggs you have".
Do you understand?
It's called a Tommytini.
It's just vodka and a bunch of cinnamon.
That sounds gross.
- Ben.
Oh, Miller Lite.
How'd you know?
Everybody knows.
That's your drink.
Tommy.
Let's do this.
Mmm.
How's it going?
Hey, look who's socializing!
Yeah, and I'm having a good time.
Sit with us.
Okay.
Ann's in kind of a crappy mood because Chris dumped her.
Yeah, like a week ago, right?
Yeah, but I only knew about it an hour ago.
So that's why you tried to kiss him.
We were all seriously confused about that.
Who's "we"?
What are you Oh, God.
Did you keep the toilet paper?
Yes.
I feel bad, but I need it.
Hey, hey, that's gotta be Feinstein's car.
Give me Give me the Tommy Fresh.
Why?
Give me Tommy Fresh.
He's gonna smell your dreams now.
Are you okay?
Is it that bad?
Oh, my God, it's unbelievable.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Okay, everybody.
The Harvest Festival is tomorrow.
And I am so proud of all of you.
You've worked so hard.
You're amazing.
So, I have a surprise.
And it is possibly the best thing to potentially ever happen to anyone, anywhere, in the history of the universe.
Ladies and gentlemen, the world-famous Little Sebastian.
What?
- Yes.
No way!
Oh, my God.
I never thought I'd get to meet him.
It's really him.
Well done, Leslie.
Well done!
Little Sebastian made his debut at the last Harvest Festival in 1987, and he was an instant phenomenon.
For the next few years, Sebastian was the number one boy's name in Pawnee.
And the number three girl's name.
So, what am I missing?
What's the deal with this pony?
He's not a pony, Ben.
He's a mini-horse.
There's a big difference.
Well, then, why is he so famous?
Does he do something?
What does he do?
Son, this horse has an honorary degree from Notre Dame.
We all need to be very careful.
Okay?
Remember.
This little guy is 25 now.
And he has cataracts in both eyes.
He has severe arthritis.
Jerry's going to look after him.
Yes, I am.
We are both on the same diabetes medication.
Are you my Glucotrol buddy?
Are you?
Isn't it amazing?
Yeah.
I've just got to be honest.
I don't know what the big deal is.
Get out.
Okay, couldn't you put Sue's Salads here?
On Deep Fried Boulevard?
It's just There's so many junk food places and only one salad stand.
Well, there's a lot of people that don't consider salad a food.
The Harvest Festival is the biggest thing I've ever done in my career.
And if it fails, the Parks Department will be eliminated.
That's why we're going big.
Seven days, over 30 different locations, 50,000-plus visitors and four hospitality kiosks.
God, I've got to stop ending on that boring thing.
Clowns.
Man, you are just knocking these off.
You're like a ninja crossed with a Jedi or something.
You're like a nerd mixed with a dork or something.
Tom, Star Wars is not that nerdy.
No, Star Wars is not that nerdy.
It's not.
Everyone has seen it.
Everyone has seen it.
Everyone.
This guy's here.
Hey, Ken.
Hi, Leslie.
This is Ben and Tom.
That's a dope bolo.
This is Ken Hotate.
He is the tribal leader of the Wamapoke.
Have a seat.
Ken, I know why you're here.
And just let me say that we really tried.
I'm sorry, Leslie, but this is a big one.
I'm under a lot of pressure.
I'm going to need to formally ask you to move the carnival.
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
The carnival is on the site of the Battle of Indian Hill, which was an epic seven-day battle that the Wamapoke lost due to the fact that they didn't have any weapons.
During the battle, was shot one hundred and two times by the cavalry.
Did he die?
Yes.
And this moment will be commemorated for the next seven days with shooting galleries and fried dough stands.
Ken, I understand, but this is the only place in town that's big enough to house the carnival rides.
Plus, you know with Pawnee's history, it's very difficult to not be offensive.
This is a map of all the atrocities the Pawnee settlers inflicted upon the Wamapoke Indians.
The atrocities are in blue.
We put up a memorial plaque, and we have a Wamapoke exhibit in the history tent.
I completely understand you, but this is sacred burial ground.
And I just hope that the souls of my ancestors don't put a curse on this festival.
There are two things I know about white people.
They love Matchbox Twenty, and they are terrified of curses.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, somebody, I don't want to say who, it was totally me, got Sweetums to donate another fifteen cotton candy machines.
Take that, curse.
Take that, curse.
Ow, ow, ow!
Right in the chest.
Bazooka.
That's funny.
Ugh, get a room.
Okay, so guys, focus up.
Joan Callamezzo is coming by with a camera crew for an exclusive, last-minute walk-through of the Harvest Festival before we open tomorrow.
So, everything needs to be perfect.
Joan is always looking for a scandal.
She's like an eagle-eyed tiger.
Eagle-Eyed Tiger.
New band name.
I call it.
So, everybody, gather around.
Let's grab hands.
I don't hold hands.
Okay.
You're all amazing, wonderful people.
And I really want you to have fun today and not focus on the fact that if one thing goes wrong, we're all going to lose our jobs.
That's not inspiring.
Okay.
Let's go get them, everybody.
Okay.
Yes.
Hey, whatever happened to you and the Bionic Man?
Chris?
He broke up with me, but he did it so nicely that I didn't even realize he did it.
I've done that to multiple men.
How are you doing?
Are you doing okay?
Thank you so much for asking.
It's been tough.
Yeah.
Two days ago, I was sobbing at a pizza buffet, and they asked me to leave.
I've been looking at some dog adoption websites.
Bought 700 dollars worth of candles from Anthropologie.
I did this to my hair.
You know, your basic bottoming out kind of stuff.
Yeah.
Normally, people tell you to talk about your problems.
I'm going to recommend you bottle that noise up.
That's what my mailman said.
Murder.
Murder the most melons.
Shaquille showered.
Shame on Shakira's sheets.
Hello, Joan.
Hello, Leslie.
Looks like a very impressive festival.
But we'll see.
We'll see.
You remember Ben.
Hi.
It's nice to see you again.
Let's get started.
Okay.
Now, the festival is spread throughout the town, but the centerpiece is the carnival.
And over here is Indiana's largest corn maze.
Wow.
Is that Pawnee corn or Eagleton corn?
Pawnee corn.
And it's organic.
Over here, we have our beautiful Ferris wheel.
Beautiful, but deadly.
When was the last time this giant wheel of death was inspected?
Actually, twice in the last week, and everything is How many of these carnies are illegals?
None.
They're all U.S. citizens.
Over in this booth, Indiana basketball legend Larry Bird's will be signing autographs for two hours on Thursday.
You got Tilda?
Yeah.
We got Tilda.
But the real coup is over there.
Little Sebastian.
Are you kidding me?
You got Little Sebastian?
See for yourself.
Wow.
He is so adorable.
Thank you, Joan.
And Little Sebastian isn't bad, either!
Tom!
How are you?
Good.
Good to see you.
Hold on a second.
What?
Did you get your breasts done?
You look amazing.
Yes, thanks for noticing.
Joan, listen to me.
This Harvest Festival, it's going to knock your socks off.
And when it does, I'm going to be there to give you a foot massage.
To completion.
Okay.
Good lord.
I swear.
It's almost like they don't want you to win.
Well, you better practice.
You've got to win me a teddy bear.
I'm going to win you a million teddy bears.
Well, I want a billion teddy bears.
Well, that's a little unrealistic.
This is a hard game.
Two million.
Deal.
All right.
Hey, I love you.
Dude, shut up!
That is awesome sauce.
You're such a good boy.
Jerry, stop bothering Little Sebastian.
Leslie said I should watch him for a little bit.
Perfect.
I've got to go get him a tail scrunchie.
Most people look at Little Sebastian and they see a famous mini-horse.
I see an advertising opportunity for my club, the Snakehole Lounge.
Wow.
That is a shockingly huge mini-horse erection.
What about your friend Ben, here?
We all know his story.
One of failure, remind us of that failure.
Well, you know, when I was an 18-year-old mayor, I tried to build a winter sports complex called Ice Town, and it bankrupted the city.
Yikes.
I was also shortstop of my J.V. baseball team.
No one ever brings that up.
And now, you're involved with this.
Do I smell another disaster, hopefully?
Look, Joan, this festival, thanks to the tireless efforts of Leslie Knope, is going to bring people nothing but happiness.
Not even I could screw that up.
I'm a reporter, not your therapist.
So, anytime someone takes a picture of him, the Snakehole's logo is in it.
Am I a genius or what?
Hey, Tom.
Where's Little Sebastian?
Somebody left the gate open and he got out, Jerry.
What?
What are you talking about?
Unbelievable.
Another in a long string of miserable failures.
You lost Little Sebastian!
I wasn't even here!
Exactly.
You look for him.
I'm going to go tell everyone what you did.
The Harvest Festival starts at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.
And as far as this reporter is concerned, it's well worth your time.
Come on down, everyone.
It's going to be sweet.
It pains me to say this, but great job here.
Thank you.
That went well.
Yeah.
It did.
Take that, curse.
Take that, curse.
Sorry?
What is this about a curse?
Curse?
What?
Nothing.
Did you Leslie!
Leslie!
It's Little Sebastian.
He's gone.
Jerry let him escape, and we don't know where he is.
Keep those cameras up.
We've got a new intro to do.
Gotcha.
Let's go ahead.
Let's get some shots of chipped paint and crying babies.
How about some of those spooky traffic lights?
Okay, you know the drill.
Okay.
This is bad, right?
This is way worse than that.
This is a huge government project, and it's already a lightning rod.
And then, you add the Wamapoke controversy.
Double lightning rod.
Plus, we lost that little pony.
It's a mini-horse.
And that's the third lightning rod.
Triple lightning rod.
And then, you have the curse.
Quadruple lightning rod.
God, now all the vendors are going to bail, and the ticket sales will go down.
Wait.
I'm sorry, but do people in this town really believe in curses?
Oh, no, no, we all just behave rationally and believe we are all in charge of our own destinies.
Come on.
What the heck are we going to do?
How did this happen?
Maybe Little Sebastian got upset because he tried to share his true feelings with someone and they didn't reciprocate.
That's not bad.
Or maybe a balloon popped somewhere and it scared him, sent him running off.
Tom, Jerry, check the field behind the parking lot.
Andy, April, check the corn maze.
Good idea.
Horses love mazes.
Come on.
Hey, Leslie?
This big, beefy dude just came into the first aid tent because he was dehydrated, and then, a reporter came in and asked if it was because of the curse.
No comment.
Did you say, "No comment"?
You've got to say "No comment".
I did.
Good, Ann.
You're so beautiful.
Beautiful Ann.
All right.
Well, just treat him and release him, and then, don't say anything to anyone about anything for the rest of the month.
Okay.
Okay.
Run, Ann, run!
Leslie?
You've got to see this.
Yeah.
Thank you for having me.
The fact is, this carnival is being held on top of an ancient Wamapoke burial site.
Much like the house in the movie Poltergeist?
Exactly.
I spoke to Leslie Knope of the Parks Department about moving the carnival and she refused.
We do have exclusive animation of that event.
Let's take a look.
Oh, I love these things.
Sorry.
Is that what happened?
Perd None of that happened.
That is exactly what happened.
All right.
All right.
What we do is we move the shooting gallery.
That seems to be their biggest problem.
Maybe that will make them happy.
Check back in with News Channel 4, number one in curse coverage.
You know how Indians call corn "maize"?
This is why.
I never knew that.
Oh, my God.
I'm going to go look by myself.
Hey, are you alright?
You seem super not happy.
I'm fine.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, I might be going to Venezuela tomorrow.
Forever.
You're not fine.
Ludgate, something is upsetting you.
Why don't you just go ahead and tell me what it is?
I'm not mad at Andy.
Andy's great.
I awesome sauce Andy.
April!
Left.
Look right.
Yeah, okay.
I don't know what's sicker, me or your body.
You aren't sick.
Maybe you should check out my abs.
Are you experiencing abdominal pain?
Every day at the gym.
Eww.
Feel.
Oh.
What are you doing tonight?
I think I'm going to have to pass.
Your loss.
Are you going to hit that?
Him?
He isn't exactly boyfriend material.
Who said anything about a boyfriend?
Use him.
Abuse him.
Lose him.
Hey, hey, hey.
Did you find him?
Yeah, Jerry.
He's right here in my pocket.
Damn it.
Ground mission failed.
We need a bird's eye view.
You want me to climb on top of the Ferris wheel?
We're extremely confident that there is no curse, and everyone is going to have a great time tomorrow.
Okay?
Wow.
First, Ice Town.
Now, this.
Bad luck really follows you around, huh?
Okay.
I'd like to start by addressing some of the false rumors about the festival.
First of all, we have plenty of food.
There is no food shortage.
There are not, as one reporter suggested, dozens of escaped convicts meandering around the carnival.
And at no time was any Parks Department worker, quote, "feasting on petting zoo animals".
You were in charge of watching a tiny horse, and you failed.
Look, I'm only going to say this once.
What if Little Sebastian is on this Ferris wheel?
How about you only say that never?
Leslie, how big of a disaster will this be on a scale of nine to ten?
It will not be a disaster.
It will be a success.
And I want to let everyone know that, in an attempt to be sensitive to our Wamapoke friends, we have moved the shooting gallery, per their request.
So, yes, Perd.
Yeah, the statement that this reporter has is a question.
Will that be enough to lift the curse?
Perd, you know as well as I do that there's no such God.
Crap on a spatula.
It's the curse.
That's exactly what it is.
You know what?
Everyone, relax.
Please, we'll get this up and running in no time.
Well Jerry, what the hell?
I didn't do this.
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.
Jerry's fault.
We cannot catch a break.
Yeah, well, I'll help you out.
I'm going to go.
What?
I feel like I'm jinxed or something.
What are you talking about?
Look, you were totally fine until I got involved.
So, I feel like I should probably just go.
Okay?
I'm really sorry.
I'm the curse, I think.
So, I'm going to get out of here.
All right?
When they're missing this long, they're usually dead.
Well, if that's true, then you're going to have to answer to the whole town.
And God.
Okay.
You were the one who let him out, Tom.
Okay, now, stop trying to blame me.
Jerry, can you please be quiet?
I can't hear myself not talking to Andy.
Ron, will you please tell me why April is mad at me?
Ron, can you please tell Andy All of you, be quiet.
Andy, she's mad because you said "awesome sauce" instead of "I love you, too".
April, he loves you.
Stop being a child.
Tom, you're clearly at fault here.
Blaming Jerry won't save you.
Jerry, we both know you were shotgunning funnel cakes instead of watching Little Sebastian.
So, everyone apologize to everyone else.
- I'm sorry, Tom.
- I'm sorry.
I do love you.
You do?
Yeah.
That's what, you know, makes the sauce so awesome.
Jerry just farted.
I'm very upset.
I get nervous.
Hey, Leslie?
Generator's shot.
No.
I got the T.M.K. 2500 specifically for the extra capacity.
Wow.
You know your stuff.
You single?
Not now, Ed.
How could that happen?
All those TV crews plugged in and overloaded it.
Okay.
How and where can I get a new one in, like, I don't know, now?
There's only one place in town that has a generator that size.
You've got to be kidding me.
So, you need to borrow our generator?
Ken, I am coming to you on my knees, begging for help, much like the early settlers of Pawnee begged the Wamapoke Now, but that was a A trick, and over 50 Wamapoke were slaughtered.
I know, but this is not a trick.
I am prepared to put the Wamapoke history exhibit inside the carnival grounds, right past the entrance turnstile, so that you have to look at it before you start having fun.
Now, that's interesting.
It's been really awesome looking at you.
Most carnival nurses are total grenades.
Okay, you're all set.
You are free to go.
Or you could stay here and make out with me until the lights come back on.
Hell, yeah.
Beat it, Donna.
Aye-aye, Captain.
I'm just trying to do something good for this town, and I'm trying to save my friends' jobs.
Can you help me out here?
A Native American tribe making a deal with the government.
What could go wrong?
You can have the generator, Leslie.
Thank you, Ken.
And I will issue a statement saying that the curse has been lifted.
Well, actually, I have another idea.
With that sacred ceremony, the Wamapoke curse has been lifted.
Wow.
Thank you.
Intense stuff from Ken Hotate.
And in other good news, he gave us a scare, but he's back now.
The one, the only, Little Sebastian.
We spotted him from the top of the Ferris wheel, at the center of the corn maze.
After the power came back on, we went and got him.
It took us four hours to solve that maze.
It took the horse 15 minutes.
Jerry's still out there.
I suppose I ought to go look for him.
Right after I get a bratwurst.
Welcome.
Come on in.
Have fun.
Thanks.
Enjoy yourself, ladies.
Hey.
Hey.
Look who's back.
I'm sorry I left.
I honestly felt like I was cursed or something.
Ice Town, and now, this.
Ice Town was a disaster, and it seems like it was probably your fault.
From what I can tell, you mismanaged the hell out of it.
Wow.
Why even say that already?
But the point is, this project, this is as much yours as it is mine.
It's ours, and it's going to be really great.
And I'm glad you're here.
Wow.
Thank you.
Is this the guy?
Yes.
This is him.
Ah, yes.
Special Wamapoke ceremony.
The curse has been lifted.
Wow.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Gosh, you're filthy.
Go clean yourself up.
Try to look professional.
Hello.
Enjoy yourselves.
Hey.
I like your necklace.
My God.
He is just the best ever.
You're the best ever.
But he's a close second.
Aren't you, Little Sebastian?
He really is amazing.
You finally get it now, right?
Hello?
He's fantastic.
I totally get it now.
I don't get it.
At all.
It's kind of a small horse.
I mean, what am I missing?
Am I crazy?
Hey, Ben, you just missed it!
He whinnied!
Yeah.
No, I totally heard that.
It was great.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Gee whiz.
The Harvest Festival was a real triumph.
We had over eighty thousand people in attendance, which surpassed our wildest expectations.
I would like to specifically single out Leslie Knope.
I speak for the mayor, city council, and all of Pawnee when I say we can't wait to see what the heck you're going to do next.
Step on up here, Les.
Thank you.
Paul, are you okay?
Uh Oh, my gosh.
Holy!
Oh, my God.
Call 911!
That was the second most awkward way a man has ever grabbed my breast.
All right, guys.
Everybody, listen up.
Just a few notes about our camping retreat tomorrow.
We're all gonna meet here and leave as a group at 6:45 a.m., promptly.
Why are we doing this?
Harvest Fest is over.
We do not wanna have a sophomore slump.
This camping trip is our chance to think of some really big ideas.
Why don't you just tell us what our next project is, and I'll go camping by myself.
Look, I have ideas, Ron.
Okay?
I have, like, 100 new ideas.
But the point is, the pressure is on.
We only have one chance to make a second impression.
What portion of this camping trip will take place outside?
All of it.
Pass.
Can't pass.
It's a mandatory work retreat.
I have a question.
What if we're scaling a cliff and I start to fall?
Can I grab onto your boob for support?
No, Tom, don't.
Her boob kills.
My boob does not kill.
Paul did not die.
He had a heart attack, which required an octuple bypass.
Besides, the Pawnee Sun said that my chest saved his life.
How's the best municipal department in Pawnee?
That's you guys.
Paul is going to be recuperating for a while.
So, the mayor asked me to step in as City Manager.
And I of course accepted immediately because Pawnee is literally the greatest town in the country.
Of course, I am gonna miss Indianapolis, which is the most wonderful city in America.
I'm so excited to be working with you all again.
And Leslie, I cannot wait to hear your new big idea.
I wanna hit the ground running, and your new mystery project is going to be the hydration pack that gets me to the finish line.
You're all my little hydration packs.
I'm sure I am not.
Ron.
Are, too.
Hydration pack!
Hey, you gotta hear this hilarious story that he's telling me.
Tell her what happened.
My identity was stolen.
His identity was stolen.
Tell her about the accounts.
They were frozen.
Frozen.
Bye, Kyle.
Where are you going?
Oh, my God.
How's the coolest chick ever?
Not good.
What do you mean?
Leslie's making us go on a camping retreat.
That's awesome.
Camping's the best.
Camping sucks.
It's super boring.
And you can see the stars, which I hate.
They're creepy.
I love camping.
I bet you I can get you to love it, too.
Why don't I meet you out there?
If you hate it, we'll leave and go make out.
But if you love it, we'll stay and make out.
Either way, a ton of making out.
You in?
Ann Perkins.
Chris.
Hey.
I heard you were back.
Yeah.
I didn't do this because of you.
Well, it looks great.
Yeah, you look great.
Am I right?
It's So good running into you.
You know, we should get together soon.
I'd love to catch up.
Me, too.
Catch up and mustard.
Ketchup and mustard.
I just was Oh!
So delightful.
I relish your wit.
Well, I salsa your face.
I should hate him.
He broke up with me.
Well, there was an ex that I still liked after he broke up with me.
But it was really hard to stay mad at him.
He was an amazing dentist.
You know, when he saw me, I swear his face lit up.
Ann.
What do you think "We should get together soon" means?
No.
Do not read into this.
Remember, this is the guy that was so upbeat and positive, when he broke up with you, you didn't even know it happened.
Yeah.
Come camping with us.
It'll be really fun.
You'll be away from Chris.
You can brainstorm.
I'll give you first dibs on s'mores.
Okay.
That sounds fun.
Here is our official retreat schedule.
It divides our time evenly between work and play.
Come on, everybody.
Let's hustle.
Let's get to the brainstorming!
Great attitude, Ron.
I just wanna get the work over as soon as possible so I can do some fishing.
Fishing relaxes me.
It's like yoga, except I still get to kill something.
All right.
I call this wonderful spot.
You didn't bring a tent?
I don't really go camping ever, Jerry.
So, I'm not going to spend $150 on a tent.
I'm just gonna sleep on the floor.
It's called the ground when it's outside.
Whatever.
Why?
Do you guys do this a lot?
Camping?
I've never been before, but I think I'm gonna love it.
Why am I gonna love it?
SkyMall.
Come check out my tent.
I ordered a bunch of crap off SkyMall.
I got my TV, my Xbox, DVD.
Awesome bed right there.
DJ Roomba's in the mix.
It's like I'm not even camping.
This is actually a dog couch, but it's super comfortable.
It's really important to me that April loves camping.
So, I went ahead and set up the ultimate campsite love nest.
Complete with beautiful starlight.
We got champagne.
Also, rose petals.
As you can see, they smell terrific.
We need big ideas, and we need 'em now.
Who wants to go first?
I propose that we take all the money we made from the Harvest Festival and return it to the citizens.
So, how much would that be per person?
About 83 cents.
Per household.
Before postage.
Are we done?
What do Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, and Drake all have in common?
Oh, I know this one.
They are all rappists.
Oh, my God.
They're rappers, Jerry.
And what they have in common is none of them have ever performed in Pawnee.
Why?
Because we don't have an adequate concert venue.
Until now.
The Pawnee Amphitheater.
How much would that cost?
Not that much.
$200, $300 million.
Right.
Great.
Luxury dog park.
Do you want to tell us any more?
Poodles only.
No pooping.
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Where are you?
We're inside the main entrance, near the sign that says "Pawnee Campground".
I'm in a totally different place.
That's why we can't see each other.
My God, Andy, I don't even wanna be here.
The air is too fresh.
It's disgusting.
I can't breathe.
There's a brook somewhere that won't stop babbling.
Shut up!
Sweetheart.
Just hold tight and I'll be there.
Well, April is right here.
And I am down here somewhere.
How about we just invest the money?
Make 4% a year.
You know, set up a nice little nest egg for the city.
What do you think?
Great idea.
Thanks, white Urkel.
All right.
Maybe it's not the sexiest idea, Tom, but it's smart.
What are you even still doing here?
Harvest Festival is over.
Shouldn't you be back in Indianapolis?
Hey.
Ben helped us launch the Harvest Festival, and he knows how Chris's mind works.
And he's a valuable asset to the team.
Thank you.
April has not presented her idea.
April?
I didn't come up with anything.
Why?
Because I know that whatever we come up with isn't gonna be good enough anyway, and we're just gonna go with your idea.
She's got a point.
Leslie, just tell us what your idea is so I can go back to the Thunderdome.
That's what I'm calling my tent.
I am really disappointed in all of you.
You know, the whole town is looking at us right now.
And you're letting 'em down.
Take an hour.
Go clear your heads and see if you can come up with a real idea that we can use.
And also, see if you're interested in contributing to this department.
Then, after that, I will tell you my idea.
Wow.
You really let 'em have it.
Well, I had no choice.
I didn't wanna tell them my idea.
Why not?
Because I don't have one.
I don't have an idea, Ann.
I'm so screwed, Ann.
The meeting is tomorrow, and I don't have anything.
Why not just build the park on the lot behind my house?
Chris wants the new project to generate revenue.
What about those binders in your office?
They're filled with small ideas.
We need a big, juicy idea.
I'm so desperate, I even brought in my dream journal, hoping it would inspire me.
"I married ALF and we're pretty happy".
That sounds nice.
It was.
Okay, listen to me.
You are smart and creative and talented, and you're gonna be fine.
You're probably right.
I just need an hour and it'll come to me.
Hello?
Andy, you have to save me.
I'm camping with people I work with.
Hello.
April.
Hello?
Walk around in circles like I am.
Help triangulate the phone call.
Hello?
Hang on.
I'm gonna try to get to higher ground.
I found some thorns.
I mean, yes, my daughter might think she is old enough to be sexually active with her boyfriend.
But I'm sorry, 16, that just seems too young to be on birth control.
You know, I was 24 when Gayle took my virginity.
What say we just stand here in silence and think of ideas for projects?
You know what I should do?
I should lead a teen abstinence workshop.
That might be incredibly effective.
Hey, Tom.
One second.
I'm just in the middle of a head massage.
Well, that's a good stopping point.
What's up?
Uh You wanna bounce some ideas off each other?
Here's a better idea.
How about I bounce my way over to my dog couch and watch a little Season Six of Top Chef?
All right.
I know Leslie seems upset.
But the truth is, she's better than us at this stuff by a thousand miles.
So, there's really no point.
Care for some fondue?
Yeah.
Hey.
How do you afford all this stuff?
I just return it the next day and claim it was defective.
The key is crying a lot.
No one likes to hear a grown man cry.
"And then, my hand accidentally went in the panini press"!
Hey.
You wanna go for a walk?
Yeah.
Wow.
The sky is really beautiful.
It's pollution from the Sweetums factory.
It's gorgeous, but is it worth the asthma?
No.
Ben, this new project idea, it's not really a big deal.
I'm probably making too much out of it.
Oh, no, no.
It's really big.
I mean, you got everyone's attention with the Harvest Festival.
Now, you're gonna seal the deal.
It's the chance you've been waiting for.
What if the festival was, like, a high point for me, and I never do anything better than that?
Then you wouldn't be Leslie Knope.
So, I have to keep thinking about good ideas all the time, or I'm no longer myself?
No, no, no.
No, no.
Not at all.
I've just honestly never met someone who works as hard as you do.
I mean, you're like the Energizer Bunny of city government.
And when she looked in the back of her car, she saw that even though it was her own private property, she would be forced to take it in for a state inspection!
Okay, guys.
Listen up.
What was that?
That was me talking.
No, I heard it, too.
Andy?
If that's a coyote, someone needs to pick me up off the ground now.
Oh, my God!
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?
I was just out for my nighttime run, and I thought, "Why not go visit the Parks Department"?
How's everything going here?
Super great.
Really well.
We have a great idea.
Tell me now while I sit on this boulder.
I'm much more receptive to new ideas when my heart rate is still elevated.
Chris, do you wanna maybe just talk for a minute?
Let them work?
Oh!
Sure.
What was that?
What was that?
Leslie, just tell us your idea.
Los Angeles, Season One isn't gonna watch itself.
Here it is.
What do you think?
I don't have an idea.
I'm sorry.
I thought if we all worked really hard, I could come up with something.
But I don't have anything, and we're totally screwed.
And what we need to do is just keep working and just work again more and just do it and get it.
And then we got it and we're good.
Go with that.
I think I'm gonna turn in.
You're not going anywhere.
No one's going anywhere.
No one's sleeping because this is an all-nighter.
And that'll be fun.
We'll all stay up and then, I'll be like, "Hey!
No one sleep"!
Do you hear how loud that is?
You're not sleeping through that.
Is there anything else to eat?
The marshmallows are all gone.
We have nothing to eat.
Jerry scared all the fish away with his loud personal stories.
I wanna go home.
I miss my canopy bed.
Yeah.
I'm fine with not camping.
Especially since my stupid boyfriend abandoned me!
I'll fire up the van.
You know, I've never moved this slowly before.
It's almost like being in quicksand.
Hey, um, listen.
When you dumped me, it was really embarrassing.
You just kind of took off.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I mean, I never meant to hurt you.
And well, I'm back now.
Hey, I have a great idea.
Why don't we go to this rustic diner that I know?
We can have egg white omelets and we can continue to talk about us.
Sounds good.
No, no.
Chocolate or butterscotch?
Swirl me.
Dude, camping is awesome.
I love it.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
How long have you been running power to this tent?
I don't know.
How long have we been here?
Ten hours.
No!
I was TiVoing Cupcake Wars.
This is ridiculous!
Look, I am used to a certain level of comfort in my life, and I didn't want to sacrifice that.
Okay, well, I packed everything up.
So, now, you're telling me I have to go unpack it?
Guys, this is a sign.
You wanted to leave, and now you're stuck here with me.
So, we can work all night.
This is gonna be so much fun!
All-night work!
All-night work!
All-night work!
You know what?
There's a bed and breakfast right up the road.
I'm gonna head there.
Yes.
Let's keep brainstorming.
I have a good feeling about this B&B.
One day, there's gonna be a plaque there that reads, "This is where Leslie Knope came up with the amazing idea for" Damn, I thought that would work.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
So, while they re-paint the lines in the parking lot, we're asking everyone to do street parking.
I'm not street parking my Mercedes.
Well, everyone is.
I'm doing it.
'Cause nobody wants to steal a Saturn.
All right, moving on to recycling.
You okay, Ron?
Just a little tooth pain.
I'm fine.
Continue.
Okay, each department will be getting blue bins Do you need to go to the dentist, Ron?
I don't like dentists.
Just a second.
Hey.
No, no.
No!
No, no, no, no!
Oh!
What the?
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, everybody.
What were we talking about?
Recycling?
Dentist pulled the tooth out yesterday.
But it's always a good idea to demonstrate to your co-workers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain.
Plus, it's always fun to see Tom faint.
Attention, everybody!
Everybody, listen up.
You are all officially invited to a dinner party, which is officially my friend Burly's home, because I don't have a home.
That's it.
There's no more left.
Give it to him.
We've been dating for almost a month, so we just decided that we wanted to do something special.
And dinner parties do combine two of our favorite things, dinner and parties.
Parties.
Yeah.
It's like if you could have a Xbox pancake.
Your invitations include requests for each of you to bring stuff, 'cause we don't have a whole lot.
Don't be late.
Watch out.
"Dearest Tom, please bring silverware".
"Please bring cooked steak".
This is ridiculous.
They're young.
They're in love.
They're ready to show it to the world.
It's very sweet.
And we're all going.
- What?
There's a boy's sale at Dillard's today.
Hey.
Oh, hey.
You going tonight?
Yeah.
Apparently they want me to bring Avatar, and 50 pairs of 3-D glasses, and a 3-D-capable television.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Well, I will see you there, with all of those things.
I was actually coming to see you.
I wanted your advice on something.
Oh, yeah?
My boss in Indianapolis, he wants me back on the road in a week.
But then this morning, Chris offered me a job to stay here in Pawnee and work for him.
Do you wanna do that?
Well, I don't know.
I've been moving around so much the past few years.
It might be nice to stay in one place for a while.
What do you think?
Well, this is a great city.
You know, it's definitely the best city in Indiana, probably America, possibly the world.
Sure.
But on the other hand, you've put in 12 years with the state government.
So you think I should say no to Chris and head back to Indianapolis or It's a tough call.
You know what I would do?
You should make a pros and cons list.
That always works for me.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, maybe I'll do that.
Excellent.
Nice talking to you.
Good stuff.
Okay.
Yeah.
So how does this work?
All right, you just fill out your name tag, and you're all set.
Okay.
But I mean, do I just go up and talk to anyone, or do I wait for them to talk to me, or Are you asking me how to flirt with men?
Okay.
All right.
It's a whole new Ann Perkins.
I'm putting myself out there, meeting some new people, having some casual fun, and it is awkward.
Gayle went out and got me this new party shirt.
So be honest, what do you guys think?
You know what, Jerry?
I make fun of you a lot, but credit where credit is due.
You know, I like how the Damn it.
I was so close.
It's a terrible shirt.
Hey, guys.
Okay, everybody listen up.
April's friend Orin is here.
He's very intense and very weird.
So if you end up talking to him, just make sure you don't reveal anything personal about yourself.
- Hey, gang.
- Hey.
What'd you bring?
I was in charge of the cake.
To be fair, it's not a cake so much as it is a vegetable loaf.
You got your mushrooms, your alfalfa sprouts, your spinach, and I had it sweetened with fruit reduction.
But did they ask you to bring a vegetable loaf or a cake?
No, a cake, but this is so much healthier.
So not only does this thing exist, but now you have deprived everyone of cake.
Take a walk, Ron.
Yep.
Donna.
Oh, my God.
I am so excited to see you here.
These things are horrible when you're by yourself.
What?
Do you know where you are right now?
We're in the jungle.
There are no friends here.
It's every woman for herself.
You're joking, right?
Do I look like I'm joking?
Dating is a zero-sum game.
If you get a man, I don't get that man.
I'm here because of advice that you gave me to be more adventurous in my life.
Here's some more advice.
Beat it.
Hey.
Ben, heard you might be leaving Pawnee.
I don't know.
I'm thinking about it.
Well, you are a huge nerd.
But I'd be sorry to see you go, man.
Thanks, Tom.
Okay, this party needs a little help.
I'll be right back.
So are you going on, like, a year-Iong walking tour of the set of The Lord of the Rings in New Zealand?
To be honest with you, I wasn't a fan of Peter Jackson's interpretation.
So you can put that one away.
Andy, I think you maybe should put some more food out.
Totally agree.
Just firing up the Bagel Bites now.
Hey.
Oh, my God.
What do you think?
April, you're not supposed to let me see you.
No, come on.
You have to look.
This is important.
You have to tell me if I look good.
Hey, guys, what's going on?
Uh It's supposed to be a big surprise.
But tonight, me and April are getting married.
To each other.
Is April pregnant?
Are you pregnant?
Yes.
Yes?
No.
Are you sick?
Are you terminal?
Is it like that movie A Walk to Remember?
Yes.
What?
No.
God.
Oh, God.
Why are you doing this?
Why is this great thing happening?
Well, I mean, it's actually a really funny story.
We were hanging out.
And suddenly, I was like, "What if we got married tomorrow"?
And she was like "Fine".
She's like, "Fine".
That is a great story.
But you guys haven't been together very long, and you have no place to live.
We've been together long enough, and we'll find a place to live.
Yeah.
Like, a house or, like, a condo or something.
Probably a condo.
You can't just get a condo.
No, you're right.
House.
I love Andy and April as a couple.
I want them to stay together forever.
But relationships need planning.
You just can't jump into something without thinking.
It took me four years to find the right hairdresser, and we still fight all the time!
Andy and April are gonna surprise people with a secret ceremony.
Whoa.
Secret wedding.
Julia Roberts pulled the same move.
Is that that toothy girl from Mystic Pizza?
Ron, please, I need you to help me knock some sense into them.
It's not really my place.
Or yours.
Hi.
I'm Ann.
Brian.
What's your occupation?
I'm a manager at a sporting-goods store.
No way.
Me, too.
Seriously?
Which one?
No, I'm not.
I was just ribbing you.
What are you drinking?
Yeah.
What?
Oh, I don't know.
I couldn't hear you.
So you just laughed and said, "Yeah"?
Yeah.
Excuse us.
That was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
Did you grow up in the woods?
Are you Nell from the movie Nell?
I told you I'm rusty.
All right, come with me.
Hey, Andy.
Yeah.
I know what's going down, and I'm so happy for you guys.
Thank you, Tom.
Hey, something just occurred to me.
Can I be your best man?
Yeah, dude, totally.
Thank you.
My best man.
Best man!
One of my life goals is to be a best man.
It's a baller position.
You get drunk.
You make speeches.
And you make love to the prettiest bridesmaid, usually standing, from behind.
Look, I know that I cannot tell you what to do.
I know it doesn't work, from all the times I've tried to tell you what to do before.
But you know what would be fun?
Maybe we should make a pros and cons list.
Let me take you home, and then we'll go do that together.
It'll be a blast.
Leslie, relax.
You relax.
You relax all the way home and get into bed.
You need to go to bed.
April.
Girl talk.
Hey, what's your middle name?
The justice of the peace lady needs to know.
You don't know each other's middle names?
I don't wanna say it out loud.
- Ew.
- Shut up.
Roberta!
Such a loser.
Can't believe I'm marrying him.
You don't have to.
I'm going to.
And then I'm gonna divorce him.
Then I'm gonna marry him again.
One time, I fell madly in love with a Civil War reenactor that I had only known for six hours.
And then I found out he wore those clothes all the time.
And he was married.
But the clothes thing really bothered me.
You always wanna scribble the name.
Make 'em read.
Draw them in.
Make 'em work for it.
Right.
Two shots of Jameson.
Don't make too much eye contact.
You wanna seem available, but not too available.
Oh, thanks.
I think I'm good for now.
I'm not gonna Yeah.
All right.
Let's do this.
Ron, you are so amazing with me and April, stuff.
I love you, man.
Would you be one of my best men?
I'd be honored to, son.
Chris, you helped me get April back.
Would you be my best man?
Nothing else in my entire life would make me happier as long as I live.
Jerry.
I'm so glad you made it.
This shirt is hilarious.
Derek and Ben, will you be my best men?
Got a little competition for the best man, huh?
Well, you know what the best best man does.
Excuse me!
Are there any strippers here?
Former strippers?
Non-dancers but you're feeling a little bit drunk?
What are you doing?
I'm throwing Andy an impromptu bachelor party.
It's my duty as best man.
The wedding's in four minutes.
It's that kind of negative thinking that makes you a less good best man.
Hello?
Hi, Ann, it's Leslie, Leslie Knope from the Parks Department.
Yeah, I know.
Where are you?
April and Andy are getting married tonight.
What?
Yeah, I know.
I need you to get down here, Ann.
I need you to kiss him again or kiss her or kiss somebody.
I don't know, Ann!
Help me, please!
Relationships are like scuba diving.
If you come up too fast, you get the bends.
And the reason why I know this is because I was dating a guy once, and we were scuba diving, and I told him that I loved him underwater, and he shot up really fast, and he got the bends.
No, Orin, I don't know how I'm going to die.
Wait.
Are you asking me or telling me?
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Yes, please.
April and Andy are about to get married.
Wow.
My Brita filter's older than their relationship.
Wait a second.
Should I change my Brita filter?
I don't know.
It depends on how frequently you use it.
True.
Stay focused, okay?
Please.
The point is two boneheads, whom I love dearly, are about to sacrifice their future 'cause they haven't thought this thing through.
And nobody seems concerned about this.
Attention, everybody.
Mesdames and Missoirs.
If you would do me the obligation of having your honor, heretofore, in the room doth right over there, hence.
What?
Big event in that room, Oh, my God.
This is really happening.
I love April and Andy.
I want them to stay together.
And that is why I have to stop their wedding.
Hi, guys, remember how I told you there was going to be a surprise later?
Well, the surprise is you are not actually at a dinner party.
You're at our wedding.
All right.
Let's do this.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to marry Andrew Maxwell Dwyer and April Roberta Ludgate.
I guess I kind of hate most things.
But I never really seem to hate you.
So, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
Is that cool?
Yes.
Is it my turn?
Yes.
"April, you're the most awesome person "I have ever known in my entire life.
"I vow to protect you from danger.
"I don't care if I have to fight "an ultimate fighter, or a bear, or him, "your mom I would take 'em down".
Andy.
I'm getting mad right now even thinking about it.
I'm telling you.
It's okay.
I wanna spend the rest of my life, every minute, with you.
And I'm the luckiest man in the galaxy.
And now the rings.
By the power vested in me by the State of Indiana, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Go fly away.
Fly!
Fly!
Wings of love.
Okay.
All right.
So that one is dead.
We know that.
You wouldn't have been able to stop it, you know.
I could've yelled something or tackled someone.
But you didn't, because deep down, you knew it wouldn't have mattered.
Those kids are gonna do what they wanna do.
They may have just ruined their lives on an impulse decision.
Leslie, I got married twice.
Both times, I was a lot older than those two.
And both marriages ended in divorce And a burning effigy.
Who's to say what works?
You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice.
That's all anybody can do.
Wait.
Weren't you married three times?
Oh, my God, you're right.
I get to burn another effigy.
The key to burning an ex-wife effigy is to dip it in paraffin wax and then toss the flaming bottle of isopropyl alcohol from a safe distance.
Do not stand too close when you light an ex-wife effigy.
My sister is lame, but Andy's sort of cool.
I guess I kind of see why he'd marry her.
Also, if anyone finds my gray hoodie, I lost it.
Thanks.
That was beautiful.
You two remind me of me and my husband, George.
I gotta nail the speech.
So I brought in an expert.
Jean-Ralphio.
Can I throw something on you, see if it feels good?
Sure.
Okay, this is what I would do.
I would start with a joke.
Joke, Vince Vaughn quote, obviously.
Swingers or Crashers?
Fred Claus.
Talk about Andy's ex-girlfriends.
Quote from Love Actually.
Hold back your tears.
Pause.
Drop the microphone.
Get out of that bitch.
I wish you the best of luck, to both of you.
Thank you, Grandma.
How could anyone ever possibly top that?
Am I right?
So, thank you all for all the talking.
Let's just get back to dancing, huh?
Cool.
See you around, maybe.
That went better, right?
Yes, it did.
However, he proudly told me that he "beat herpes".
I'm sorry, Donna.
I'm gonna go home.
I just found out Andy's getting married.
So?
So that's my ex-boyfriend.
We were together for a really long time.
All right.
What?
What?
Listen, you are a hot, young doctor.
I'm a nurse, actually.
Okay, I don't know you.
But I do know that you can fix your attitude.
Do you wanna go home and feel sorry for yourself about a man you didn't wanna marry?
Or do you wanna go talk to that cute boy, who has been looking at you, and give him your number before I throw him in my Benz for myself?
All right.
I just wanna thank my family, my friends, most importantly, my best best man, Mr. Tom Haverford.
Oh!
Coolest guy I know.
And, ladies, he's single, I think.
You're not still married, are you?
No.
But you You're straight?
Yes.
Jean-Ralphio's just a friend?
Yeah.
Yeah!
Anyways, oh, my God, I'm married!
This is crazy.
What happened?
But, seriously, life is short, right?
Uh, just I really think you should just do whatever makes you happy.
That's what April and I did.
We are in love.
So we didn't overthink it.
I mean, seriously, I cannot emphasize how little we thought about this.
Am I right?
All right, well, this is a song I wrote for you, April Roberta Ludgate.
I love you.
I love you.
Yeah, yeah Oh, Grandma April, there's so little time The things I really want to do Let's fly to the sky It's so awesome Exactly.
Mortality.
See, I like to take each day at a time.
There's nothing in the world we can't accomplish if we try.
I have to go.
It's been great talking to you.
Hey.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna say another word.
This is your day.
I just wanted to say that I'm really glad you're here.
I think you're awesome, and I love you.
What's the deal with that hot girl, April?
What's the deal with her?
Yeah.
Like, is she good to go?
Like, is she down to clown?
She's married.
She got married, like, 20 minutes ago.
Oh, my God.
That's the same girl from the thing.
From the wedding ceremony, yeah.
All the good ones are taken, huh, bro?
Yeah.
Hey.
You should stay.
Don't go back to Indianapolis.
You should stay here.
You think?
Yeah.
Yes.
It's a great city here, you know?
And there are great people.
And you've made a lot of friends.
And what are you gonna do?
You gonna go back to your old job and hack up people's budgets?
Stay here.
Help us build something.
I already accepted the job.
I'm staying here.
That's good.
Yeah, I think so.
Orin's behind me, isn't he?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
So just keep your eyes on me.
Okay.
Don't panic, 'cause he can smell fear.
What do I Just keep talking to me.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
How was the wedding?
Run!
"Hey, Ann, it was great talking to you last night.
"Hope we can get together soon".
Okay, now you write, "Who is this"?
Hey, you guys, we got a video from April and Andy.
Oh.
Okay.
How you guys doing?
Hey, we're on our honeymoon.
It is awesome.
We're at Burly's family vacation house on Lake Michigan.
We're having so much fun.
Except for Roberta, here, turns out, sucks at water skiing.
Oh, my God.
So bad.
I'm gonna divorce you.
Andy sucks at driving a boat.
And I'm gonna divorce him, probably right now.
Well, they're still together.
You owe me 20 bucks.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Pawnee is, as you all know, the fourth most obese city in America.
Soon to be number three.
We're coming for you, San Antonio.
No, we are not.
We are slimming down.
Starting right here at City Hall.
I am implementing a government-wide health initiative.
We could have a City Hall dodgeball league!
I have first pick, and my pick is Ron.
Great idea!
Keep 'em coming.
Now, if anybody would like to join me, I will be running backwards up the big hill behind the Walmart.
Don't freak out, but Joe from Sewage just unhooked your bra with his eyes.
What?
Oh, boy.
Hi, Joe.
What's up, Knope?
Looking good these days.
What do you say?
Van's out back.
Let's roll.
Where is this coming from?
I don't know.
You're putting out some vibe today.
It's just driving me crazy.
Listen, if you're looking for a good time, why don't you come on down to the Toilet Party?
That's what we call the Sewage Department.
Great.
Okay.
Liking the view.
Still got it, Joe.
- No, you don't.
Christopher.
Got a second?
Oh, hey, Ron.
Listen.
I've eaten a commissary hamburger for lunch every day for 12 years.
I just wanted to make sure this pointless health crusade won't affect the only part of my job that I like.
Oh, no, those hamburgers are gone.
Red meat can cause sluggishness, heart disease, even impotence.
Has the opposite effect on me.
You ever tried a turkey burger?
Is that a fried turkey leg inside a grilled hamburger?
If so, yes.
Delicious.
A turkey burger.
You take lean, ground turkey meat, you make that into a burger instead of red meat.
Why would anyone do that to themselves?
What if I told you that I could make a turkey burger that tastes better than any other burger you've ever had?
Challenge accepted.
Cook-off later today in the courtyard.
If I win, hamburgers remain in the commissary.
What do I get if I win?
The rarest jewel of all.
Victory over me, Ron Swanson.
I like that.
We're on.
You know, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually checked out that snow globe museum that you recommended, and it was pretty awesome.
Yeah.
I have to say.
I mean, I did get in trouble for shaking one Yeah, I'm not allowed there anymore.
So, I have some ideas for the health initiative.
Oh, okay.
How about I swing by later and we'll just, you know, we'll go over everything?
Or we could go out after work.
You know, go to J.J.'s or something, grab a bite?
Um, I don't think I can.
But why don't we just talk about it later, in this building?
Okay?
All right.
But, you're great.
And you have great ideas.
And Uh Bye.
Bye, babe.
Hey, I brought this cholesterol testing kit for the health thing.
Okay, let's do it.
So, I asked Ben out to dinner and he said no.
What?
Yeah.
He seemed really into you.
What did he say exactly?
He was like, "Huh?
What?
Uh Bye".
And then, he walked into an office that wasn't his.
You know what?
If he doesn't want to go out with you, he's nuts.
You're awesome, and there's a million other guys out there.
I have been having so much fun just dating a bunch of people.
I know.
Who was that guy you were talking to out there?
And then also kissing?
I was Crap on a crayfish.
That really stings.
I haven't pricked you, yet.
Oh, sorry.
I was just picturing it.
You know what?
Maybe you need to cast a wider net.
Have you thought about Internet dating?
Really?
I don't think that's for me.
You're a monster.
Still haven't done it, yet.
You know what?
I'll help you set up a profile.
It'll be fun.
All right.
Yeah, let's do it.
Okay.
Good.
I'm glad that's over.
Oh, it's not.
you, Ann!
Who the hell is Forp?
I don't know.
I couldn't really hear him.
It sounded like his name was Forp.
Get his number?
No.
Good girl.
Ron Swanson.
April Ludgate.
Hey, I'm just gonna pop over to Grain 'N Simple to get the very best ingredients for my burger.
Do you wanna come?
What is Grain 'N Simple?
It's a health food store.
Pawnee doesn't have a health food store.
No, but Snerling does.
And it's only a 40-minute drive.
What are you doing, Andy?
I'm getting healthier snacks for the shoeshine stand.
Chris is a food genius.
Did you know that the food you eat becomes energy?
Yeah.
Boom.
That's spaghetti.
Nachos.
That's a cookie.
That's my husband.
See you tomorrow?
Okay.
Is that a different guy from earlier?
What?
Never mind.
You ready to rock this profile?
All right.
Yellow-haired female.
Likes waffles and news.
Sexy, well-read blonde.
Loves the sweeter things in life.
Much better.
Hobbies?
Organizing my agenda.
Wait, that doesn't sound fun.
Jamming on my planner.
Favorite place?
Upstairs, there is this mural of wildflowers.
And I like to sit on a bench in front of it.
Really?
It could be anywhere in the world.
Paris, Hawaii, the Grand Canyon.
Nope.
Just the bench in front of the mural.
What about, like, an actual meadow where wildflowers are?
Eww, Ann.
I'm scared of bees.
Mural.
Okay.
What do you think of dogs?
Love.
Cats?
Love.
Fish?
Love.
Turtles?
No opinion.
They're condescending.
Describe your ideal man.
He's dark and mysterious.
And he can sing.
And he plays the organ.
I think you just described the Phantom of the Opera.
Hmm.
Ah, Nirvana.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Chris.
Amber.
Annie.
Bill.
Johnny.
No.
I don't plan to buy anything here.
I buy my burger ingredients at Food and Stuff, a discount food outlet equidistant from my home and my work.
I came here for the same reason people go to the zoo.
Shh.
Look at that thing.
Nature is amazing.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
A 98% match?
That's a soul mate-level match.
I've never seen anything this high before.
Awesome.
Okay.
I know what you're thinking.
And you know what?
You have to forget about Ben.
He had his chance and he blew it.
This computer could have found the future Mr. Leslie Knope.
Yeah.
Okay.
Entire universe of guys I might date, let's see what you got.
This is Craig at hoosiermate.
com.
How can I help you?
Craig, your service is crap.
Can you be more specific?
Yes.
Your soul mate match was totally wrong for me.
I mean, I like him as a friend and everything, but I'd never go out with him.
He's like a little sister to me.
We have a very sophisticated algorithm that's paired up thousands of couples.
I actually met my wife on the site.
Really?
Well, that's not gonna last.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
Your marriage is a sham.
Goodbye, Craig.
No, actually See you, sweetheart.
He seems nice.
Eh, he kind of lives in a barn.
What's up?
What's wrong with me?
Why do good guys hate me and gross guys love me?
Diagnose me.
You're a nurse.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're an intelligent, classy, attractive woman.
But for whatever reason, right now, only douchey guys are buying what you're selling.
So, I should go and ask them what they think I'm selling.
A douche-vestigation.
Nice.
Hi, Joe.
I know you're gonna take this the wrong way, but can I talk to you for a second?
You can do anything to me, for any number of seconds.
Hmm.
Would you like to talk outside in my van?
No, here's fine.
I was flattered by what you said earlier.
And I was just wondering, what do you look for in a woman?
She can't be in a wheelchair.
No canes.
No gray hair.
So, basically, you're just attracted to me because I'm not an elderly person.
Yeah.
And as I aforementioned, you have a killer dumpster.
What does this do?
Would you like to sample our vegan bacon?
100% meatless.
Yes, please.
Another, please.
Sir?
Is there a problem?
I'm just making sure no one ever has to eat this.
I don't think I can give you any more.
I want one.
Hey.
Yeah, I'm calling to lodge a complaint about the seaweed and almond under-eye cream I purchased from you guys.
Oh, my problem is it smells terrible.
Yeah, I even mixed it with another under-eye cream and it still smelled.
So, I ruined two eye creams.
Yes, I will hold.
Forever young, I wanna be forever young Do you really wanna live forever What's this?
Dragon fruit.
What's this?
A kiwano, or horned melon.
What's this?
A peach.
I knew that.
Wow!
Fresh lettuce is my all-time favorite food.
What's your favorite food?
Well, I take Skittles, and I put it between two Starbursts.
You know what I call it?
Skittle sandwich?
That's pretty good.
No, I call it Andy's mouth surprise.
It's nice because the flavor of the Starbursts really bring out a similar flavor in the Skittles.
Forever young I wanna be Hey, Tom.
What's up?
Do you wanna go to lunch?
No, I don't really feel like going to J.J.'s.
We can go anywhere.
Your choice.
I'm buying.
Can I get apps and 'zerts?
'Zerts are what I call desserts.
Tray-trays are entrees.
I call sandwiches sammies, sandoozles, or Adam Sandlers.
Air conditioners are cool blasterz, with a Z. I don't know where that came from.
I call cakes big ol' cookies.
I call noodles long-ass rice.
Fried chicken is fry-fry chicky-chick.
Chicken parm is chicky-chicky parm-parm.
Chicken cacciatore?
Chicky catch.
I call eggs pre-birds or future birds.
Root beer is super water.
Tortillas are bean blankies.
And I call forks food rakes.
Yeah.
You can get as many 'zerts as you want.
Well, let's get in my go-go mobile.
Car.
This'll be fun.
Let's say you rub a bottle and a genie comes out and gives you three wishes.
What would those wishes be?
Come on, Leslie.
This'll be a fun game.
Three wishes.
Go.
Okay.
First wish?
I have a huge house with a ton of balconies.
Yeah.
Okay.
And I would just stand out there and survey my empire, like a drug dealer in a Michael Bay movie.
And I'll just spend my time out there reading my iPad and drinking espressos in a terry cloth robe.
Wish number two.
Okay.
I'm the CEO of the Spike TV network.
And my best friend slash personal assistant is Oscar winner Jamie Foxx.
And we create a raunchy animated series based on our friendship, called Tommy and the Foxx.
Okay.
We don't have to do this anymore.
No, no.
I'm into it now.
Wish number three.
They remake Point Break.
I play both roles.
Keanu and Swayze.
I think if you continue cross-training the way you have, you're gonna I don't see any ingredients.
Have you bought ingredients?
Nope.
Do you need help shopping?
No.
Are you hurt?
Can you move?
Never felt better.
Chris!
Can I get these?
I said one thing.
Honey?
Pinwheel.
Let's play a different game.
I'm gonna say stuff about me, and you say, on a scale from 1 to 10, how interested in that thing you are.
Ready?
Okay.
I love sunshine and fresh air and early-morning walks.
One.
I've read five biographies of Eleanor Roosevelt.
One.
I work at the Parks and Recreation One.
That's what you do.
One.
I once kissed a girl in college.
Eight.
Where I graduated summa cum laude in history.
One.
Zero.
Negative a billion.
Don't talk about it anymore, please.
I love Food and Stuff.
It's where I buy all of my food.
And most of my stuff.
Hey, can I get these?
How much are they?
Two bucks apiece.
Good deal.
Anything else?
Nope.
Just the crows and the beef.
So, the only thing that's important to you is hotness?
Wendy?
Lucy?
All you cared about was the shape of their boobs?
No, I really liked them, and they happened to have nice breasts.
You're acting really weird.
What did you even buy me lunch for?
Just so you could yell at me for what I like about women?
Okay.
Promise not to tell anyone?
Sure.
This is insane, but you and I got matched up on hoosiermate.
com.
Soul mate-level match.
You wanna date me!
This is a date!
This is not a date, okay?
You took me to a fancy restaurant, you paid for my meal, and you're trying to get to know me better.
I was just trying to figure out why only sleazy guys are into me right now.
Nice try.
You love me.
Leslie Knope, Tom Haverford Dating in the day, dating in the night Dating all day 'cause he's keeping it tight All right, Tom.
Enough.
Dating in the car, dating on the floor Dating everywhere 'cause she wants some more What, yeah, oh, we're going to, yeah Hey, Tom, I'm just printing out these health tips.
Can you grab them for me?
One second.
I'm just looking at some real estate listings.
Oh, this is perfect for us.
Three-bedroom, and Oh, God, Les.
It has that dream closet you've always wanted.
A walk-in closet.
Oh, God.
Hey, hey, boo.
What's wrong?
Where did you go?
Come back to me.
Stop it.
Don't disappear on me.
I need you, boo.
All right.
Let's get into it.
What do you guys have for health tips?
Ben, if it's okay with you, Leslie and I are going to lead the meeting today, because of our deep spiritual connection.
Okay.
All right.
Is everything okay or Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Everything is great, Ben.
Les and I just had something magical happen today at lunch.
There is some weird juju in this room right now.
Office yoga.
We do stretches at our desk or next to our desk or in a chair.
Always good for you.
We give everyone pedometers and we have a contest.
Whoever takes the most steps wins a prize.
Anything to get their heart rate up.
You know what else gets people's heart rate up?
Doing it.
Talking about sex with my boss.
Can you excuse us for a second?
Yeah.
Hey.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Let me get off the chair.
Hey What is wrong with you?
Leslie.
It's the workplace.
You're being a little bit too feisty right now.
You are being a little bit too much of an ass right now.
Okay?
Knock it off.
I can't fight this feeling anymore.
You and I, we're dating.
You should be so lucky.
Leslie.
Huh?
Tom.
They should fix that.
It was all just a joke.
I can assure you, there's nothing romantic going on between me and Tom.
I have a very strict policy.
No office relationships, particularly between a supervisor and an employee.
The taxpayers pay us.
So, we can't have anything appearing even remotely scandalous.
I'm just saying, if you can't keep your mouth to yourself, I'm gonna have to suspend you.
I understand.
Look.
Cucumber flower.
Wow, that's so cute.
Wait, that's a garnish.
You're not supposed to eat that.
What?
So, just type up those ones we talked about, and we'll get it finalized tomorrow.
Yep.
Hey, Tom.
Yeah.
What was all that stuff with you and Leslie?
Girl likes Indian food.
What can I say?
Fine.
We got matched up on an online dating site.
And I was messing with her, she got pissed.
So, she took me out in the hallway and kissed me, out of revenge.
Really?
And as much as it pains me to admit this, it was not disgusting.
Okay.
Well, I don't need the details or anything.
I'm just saying.
She knows what to do.
All right.
Like, I was impressed.
Yeah.
It was stirring.
Goodbye.
It felt like Yeah.
All right.
Just Anyway, like I was saying I humbly place before you my east-meets-west patented Traeger Turkey Burger, an Asian-fusion burger made with Willow Farms organic turkey, a toasted taleggio cheese crisp, papaya chutney, black truffle aioli, and microgreens on a gluten-free brioche bun.
Enjoy.
Mmm.
Mmm.
This tastes as delicious as Beyoncé smells.
I'm guessing.
What is this in here?
Saffron?
Wow!
Somebody's got a sharp palate.
I love the umami flavor.
Stop being so pretentious, Kyle.
Sorry.
Here's mine.
It's a hamburger, made out of meat, on a bun, with nothing.
Add ketchup if you want.
I couldn't care less.
Ron, I am so disappointed.
I thought that you and I were gonna have a real challenge.
Never mind.
This is better.
Way better.
Mmm.
Yep.
Mmm-hmm.
Kyle?
Sorry, Andy.
Ron's is better.
Damn it, Kyle.
Oh, my God.
It's so much better, it's crazy.
Turkey can never beat cow, Chris.
Sorry.
Well, I don't understand.
I've tinkered with this recipe for years.
Granted, it's been a long time since I've had a hamburger.
This is better.
The commissary will continue to serve horrifying, artery-clogging hamburgers.
Man.
We spent, like, 50 hours working on those burgers.
I know.
Hard work never pays off.
Cooking is dumb.
I swear on this dead crow that I will never cook for you.
I love you.
I just wanted to make sure that there were no hard feelings after I forced you to break up with Tom.
Oh, we weren't No.
No hard feelings.
'Cause it's just a real bugaboo of mine.
And it applies to everyone.
Just the other day, Ben told me that he might want to socialize with somebody from the government and I said, "I'm sorry.
Not possible".
Really?
Did he say who?
No, and I didn't ask.
Because it's irrelevant.
He oversees every department.
It simply can't happen.
This is literally the best thing I've ever eaten.
Mmm.
And it's so bad for me.
I'm gonna have to jog while I digest this.
Excuse me.
Hey.
What's up?
Hey.
Well, I think I'm allergic to chutney.
Also, what's chutney?
No clue.
Yeah.
Hey, I never got to tell you the rest of my ideas.
You wanna go somewhere and talk about them?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd love to.
Let me get some actual food, and then, do you know that wildflower mural up on the second floor?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah?
You wanna meet there?
Yeah.
Okay.
Sounds good.
I don't know if the online thing is for me.
I prefer to meet people in person.
It's like door number two on Let's Make a Deal.
Do you want the thing that you have, that you know you like, but isn't perfect, or do you give it up for what's behind door number two?
I think I like what I have.
I'm gonna try to make it work with Tom.
I'm kidding!
All right, be honest, Tom.
How did you and I get matched up?
I made 26 profiles, each designed to attract a different type of girl.
Tom A. Haverford.
Sporty and sexy.
Tom B. Haverford, smooth and soulful.
Which letter did you get?
N, Tom N. Haverford.
The N stands for nerd!
I never even check that one, 'cause no one ever responds to it.
Okay.
Well, whatever.
Tom N. Haverford collects globes.
Great.
That's enough.
His favorite movie is books.
Donna?
Every time I want you to shut up, from now on.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Good morning, Ben.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Did I scare you?
No.
I just wanted to remind you of the art show that's happening tonight at the community center.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's gonna be a lot of fun.
Great.
Well, that sounds cool.
That sounds like something that will be a big success.
You know?
I mean, like everything that you put your paws on.
Your fingers.
Leslie Knope!
Ben Wyatt.
Ben, great news.
Do you remember the woman I told you about from the county commissioner's office?
Um Vaguely.
Sure you do.
Cindy Miller.
Anyway, she's agreed to go out on a date with you.
Oh.
You asked her out for me?
You're going to love her.
She is interesting, smart and beautiful.
Inside and out.
Inner beauty is very important.
And outer beauty is also very important.
I thought you had a rule about inter-government relationships.
Don't worry.
Her department is completely separate from ours.
This isn't anything like your affair with Tom Haverford.
We weren't You You I'm sorry, who are you calling?
Cindy Miller.
Cindy Miller.
Chris Traeger.
Guess who is standing in this room with me right now.
Oh, uh Ben Wyatt.
Ben, say hello.
Hi, Cindy.
Sorry.
Hi.
No apology necessary.
It's just Chris being Chris.
How are you doing?
Ooh!
Sparks are flying!
We may have to call the fire department.
It's a government joke.
I love setting people up.
Here's my secret.
I determine someone's best qualities, and then, I find someone else with compatible qualities, and I bring them together.
God, this sucks.
Why don't you just go home for the rest of the day?
I can't go home, because I have this art show opening at the community center, and I can't stay here because I see Ben, and I can't date Ben because of Chris' stupid rules.
I feel so Powerless.
Yeah.
I'm like that light bulb.
Weak, flickering, barely giving off any light, unable to make out with the light bulb I want to make out with.
You know what might make you feel better?
A hug?
Paxil.
Do you want me to get you a prescription?
Hey, Tom!
A question for you.
Do you know anyone who's looking for a roommate?
How hot?
I What?
How hot is the woman that's looking for a place to stay?
No, it's me.
I'm looking.
Come on.
That's not fair.
You shouldn't have led me to believe it was a beautiful woman.
I didn't.
I've been staying at the Pawnee Super Suites Motel for seven months.
It's a charming little inn with wonderfully random wake-up calls, delightfully unstable temperatures, and, as of yesterday, bedbugs.
"Four stars," says nobody.
I wish I could help you, Benihana, but I can't.
I have a one-bedroom.
I can't have a dude sleeping on my couch if and when I bring home a lady.
I have a ritual, and it starts on the couch.
We sit down, clap my hands, lights dim.
Okay.
I understand.
Boyz II Men.
Fades in.
Please, stop.
No.
No, you don't need to explain the ritual.
I'm good.
You know who might be able to help out a homeless dude such as yourself?
This is awesomely perfect.
Burly just moved in with his rich girlfriend, and we need help with the rent.
We have a couple of house rules, though.
Yeah, sure.
Of course.
You can't use the front door.
You have to climb in through the back window.
No personal phone conversations.
If you ever speak to me in Spanish, please use the formal "usted".
And no electricity after 6:00 p.m. She's joking.
Okay.
You can use as much free electricity as you want.
It's free.
Couple more rules.
If you ever watch a sad movie, you have to wear mascara so we can see whether or not you've been crying.
There's no noise allowed on Mondays, and no TV after breakfast.
She is lying again.
She is.
Yes.
Because it's hard to tell.
No.
We leave the TV on all day long so burglars think that we're home when we're not, which was my idea that I'm trying to patent.
So, you want to move in tonight?
Yeah.
Sure.
That would be great.
You want my gum?
Uh-huh.
Ron, can you make the opening remarks?
I'm just I'm not in the mood.
Neither am I. Ever.
What's wrong with you?
You live for this kind of stuff.
I don't have it in me right now.
Ron, please.
Do it for me.
Make the speech.
Ron, please.
Please.
Give the speech, Ron.
No.
Yes.
Please?
Ron?
Please.
No.
Please give the speech.
Please give the speech.
No.
I won't.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No way.
Please, please, please, please, please.
No.
Please, please.
Yes, yes All right!
Damn it, woman.
Okay, everyone.
Shut up and look at me!
Welcome to "Visions of Nature".
This room has several paintings in it.
Some are big.
Some are small.
People did them, and they are here now.
I believe that after this is over, they'll be hung in government buildings.
Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me.
I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they can just go outside and stand in it.
Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further.
End of speech.
And that's the TV room.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, it's a mess.
Can you throw that in the trash can?
I was just here, like, three weeks ago for your wedding.
What happened?
Well, Burly moved out.
He was the one that did all the cleaning and throwing away and stuff.
Wait, he moved out, like, a week ago.
You guys made this mess in a week?
Well, I always think April's going to clean up.
And I never clean up.
It's cute, right?
No.
Yes, it is.
Are you guys frying marbles?
We were checking to see if the fire alarm worked.
It doesn't.
The biggest challenge to picking the perfect roommate is finding someone who's willing to pay more than their share of rent without knowing it.
I think we found that in Ben.
You forgot to paint a painting, son.
So, for my painting, I chose one of my very favorite Greek myths, the centaur goddess, Dyaphena, slaying a great stag.
It's stunning.
It's breathtaking, Jerry.
Yeah.
It really is.
Wow.
Thanks, guys.
Hey, Leslie, you should really come over here and look at Jerry's painting.
Oh, my God.
That's me.
Is that me?
What?
No.
Geez, it does look like you.
You're just realizing that now?
That's what you see when you close your eyes at night, Jerry.
Topless Leslie glued to a horse.
Okay.
Leslie, I am just so, so sorry.
Dyaphena, she is this powerful goddess, and I've been thinking a lot about powerful women, and subconsciously, I painted you.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to take it right down.
No.
Leave it up.
I love it.
I don't know how to explain it.
Every time I look at it, I just think to myself, "What can't that centaur woman do?
"Besides ride an escalator and drive a car".
Art can be so magnificent.
Oh, my God.
The baby is Tom.
What?
This is easily my favorite painting ever.
What the hell, Jerry?
Look at my pot belly.
I look like a pregnant baby.
And why am I so scared?
All right, we've got to take this down.
Now.
No, this painting isn't going anywhere, Tom.
It's staying right here.
Hello, fellow lover of the arts.
Welcome to the painting.
What, is that you?
Well, it's hot.
Thank you.
This guy's in it, too.
He's the little fat baby.
Cool.
Yeah.
What's going on right here?
Baby rolls!
We've been trying to get that light fixed for months.
Thank you.
Thank her.
Good morning, Tom.
She marched into my office this morning and told me she wouldn't leave until I got this done.
Hmm.
Well, I'm glad someone's feeling good.
They're going to hang that painting in a public building where anybody can see it.
In one brush stroke, Jerry has killed the Jay-Z vibe that's taken me years to cultivate and replaced it with the fat, brown baby vibe, which is not as cool of a vibe.
Hey, Aphrodite.
Chris needs you in his office.
Hmm.
When you're done with the light, fix the printer.
I don't know how to fix printers.
Learn it.
Leslie, should I go, too?
This isn't about you, Jerry.
It's my painting.
Why am I upset?
Let's start with government-funded animal porn.
I'm not sure that's fair.
I want it destroyed, and I want a statement from this office apologizing for an obscene depiction of bestiality.
Bestiality?
It is a picture of a centaur, a beautiful half person, half horse.
And how did it get like that?
Who had sex with what and gave birth to which?
Ms. Langman, we hear you, we understand you and we are going to do whatever we can to come to a solution.
Destroy it.
Destroy it?
I mean, is she serious?
Do you find this personally offensive?
Not personally, no.
No, personally, I enjoy a good artistic depiction of the human form.
I've dabbled in nude sculpture.
I've posed nude.
In college, I was in a nude production of Cats.
But I am not in the nude now, am I?
Because we're in a government building.
And that would be inappropriate, which is what I think Marcia is saying.
So, take care of this situation.
That painting is not going to be destroyed.
Every great work of art contains a message.
And the message of this painting is, "Get out of my way unless you want an arrow in your ass, Marcia".
Morning, roomie.
How did you sleep?
Well, there were no bedbugs.
Also, no bed.
I'm going to go buy a bed.
Fork.
I'm sorry.
Are you eating turkey chili off of a frisbee?
Yeah.
It's pretty cute, right?
No.
Do you know what "cute" means?
What have you got against turkey chili for breakfast?
What have you guys got against washing dishes?
We don't have any dishes, okay?
Burly took them all when he left.
Now, I bet you feel like a jerk.
God.
Okay, I might need to not stay here anymore.
No.
Sorry, dude.
We already spent your money on a new Xbox 360 and more frisbees to eat off of.
You've got to stay.
God.
Okay.
All right.
Here's the deal.
We're going to clean this place up.
Okay?
And then, I am going to teach you how to be adults.
Cool.
We'll get to be adults.
Gee, golly.
Thanks, mister.
Fork.
Hello.
I'm Perd Hapley, and welcome to Ya' Heard?
With Perd.
Today's show begins now.
Is this art or is it pornography?
Here to answer this question is Parks and Recreation Deputy Director, Leslie Knope.
Perd, it is a beautiful work of art.
Governments should not be in the business of censorship, especially when a painting is as awesome as this one.
But this is where the controversy of this story gets even more controversial.
You are the subject of this painting.
Half woman, half horse, with what some would say are human breasts.
I am not the subject.
The subject is strong and empowered women everywhere.
But it does look a little bit like me.
Leslie, for our viewers at home who might not know, are centaurs real?
No.
Absolutely sure?
Okay.
So, you always separate your lights from your darks.
That's racist.
And then, you get your laundry Where is your laundry detergent?
Right.
Here we are.
Okay.
This is bubble bath.
You guys You wash your clothes in bubble bath?
Bubble bath, clothes soap, same thing.
No, it's not.
Well, they both make bubbles, so It was never our intention to offend anyone I guess some people object to powerful depictions of awesome ladies.
Okay.
Also joining us today is a different person.
Pornographic film actress, Brandi Maxxxx.
Pleasure to be here.
Brandi, you've starred in over 200 adult films, some of which are very good.
When did you get into the business?
Last year.
Fantastic.
Now, this painting right here, art or pornography?
Perd, I think this whole debate is ridiculous.
What Leslie and I do is obviously art.
Hang on.
There is a big difference between an oil painting of a Greek myth and a pornographic movie.
It's okay, Leslie.
I got this one.
What?
What Leslie and I want people to know is you should be able to have sex anywhere you want and show it anywhere you want.
Whether it's girl-on-girl action, bondage, or Yep.
what have you.
Okay.
Hang on.
Pornography is very difficult to define.
In fact, it was Justice Stewart who once said, "I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it".
Brandi, how would you define pornography?
For me, it's when the penis goes in.
All right, we need to do some basic organization.
Where do you put your bills when they come?
I read the magazines and give the rest to Andy.
Which I organize into a pile or stack that I put into the freezer.
Why?
So they won't get lost.
Bingo.
Okay, you have to pay these.
Good thing I didn't lose them.
Okay.
New lesson.
Basic finance.
I'm gonna teach you how to balance a checkbook.
Okay.
I am going to teach you how to open a bank account.
Bank account.
Good.
Brandi, I'm Thomas Haverford.
I just wanted to say I thought you made some excellent points up there.
I totally agree with you that people should be allowed to have sex in public places.
You look familiar to me.
Maybe you've seen me down at the Snakehole Lounge.
I'm a part-owner there.
That's you.
In the painting.
You're the fat baby.
Aw!
That's so cute.
Oh.
You're into that?
No.
Damn it, Jerry.
Imagine my horror.
I'm hanging upside down with my gravity boots watching Perd.
I see you with your painting, and I am startled and disappointed.
Well, I did not know that Brandi was going to offer me a role in her next film.
I urge you not to take that role.
I am not going to take the role.
That's good to hear, because recently, you've been a little unpredictable.
I'm sorry that I'm trying to defend a beautiful work of art.
Thank you, Leslie.
Stand down, Jerry.
This isn't your fight.
You've left me no choice.
I have convened a meeting of the Public Arts Commission, and we will abide by their decision.
Fine with me.
Public Arts Commission.
Filled with hippies who love art and sometimes weed.
Jackpot.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Good morning, Ron.
Morning.
I know how much you enjoy paperwork, but don't hover.
Nice bench.
Is that new?
No, that's been there since the '90s.
What are you doing for your birthday on Friday?
Nothing.
I never Aha!
Oh, God.
Birthday, birthday, birthday It's your birthday It's your birthday, and I know when it is Ron refuses to tell anyone when his birthday is.
He's even had it redacted on all government documents.
Three years of investigations, phone calls, Freedom of Information Act requests, and still, I had nothing, until a well-placed bribe to a gentleman at Baskin-Robbins revealed Ron's birthday is on Friday.
Damn it.
I was so careful.
Well, you blew it.
All for a free scoop of Rum Raisin.
Was it worth it, Ron?
Was it?
I command you to do nothing.
I'm not gonna do nothing.
I'm gonna do something.
And it's gonna be really big.
I have a lot of years to make up for.
I don't like loud noises and people making a fuss, and I especially don't like people celebrating because they know a piece of private information about me.
Plus, the whole thing is a scam.
Birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.
They put up a fence.
Who?
No!
What's that?
There's a small park on the line between Pawnee and Eagleton, and Last night Eagleton put up a fence around their side to keep us disgusting Pawnee hobos off their precious land.
There's even a security guard.
You got to show Eagleton I.D. to get in.
Eagleton is a bunch of rich snobs.
And that's coming from someone who has a Mercedes.
With a Harman Kardon Logic Who builds a fence to keep kids out of a playground?
Three words, Lindsay Carlisle Shay.
Who?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay and I used to be best friends.
We worked together at the Pawnee Parks Department.
Then she went to work in Eagleton and "fixed her deviated septum" and lost 35 pounds and lost something else.
What was it again?
Oh, yeah.
Her soul.
Is the Eagleton side really that much better than the Pawnee side?
To be fair, yeah.
Our side is this scrappy piece of land where kids go to smash fluorescent light tubes.
But it has a lot of heart.
That's what people always say when something sucks.
We should stand up for our town, okay?
Pawneeans are just as good as Eagletonians, although on average, we are several inches shorter and 80 pounds heavier.
People in Eagleton are straight up mean to us.
I would never set foot over there.
But it's the only place that I can get my Bumble and Bumble hair care products, so I'm there every eight days.
Okay, well, I am on "Operation No More Fence," so I'm putting you in charge of "Operation Ron's Party, colon, Shock And Awe".
I am all over it.
I just need you to do what's on that list.
Leslie has a lot of qualities I find horrifying.
But the worst one by far is how thoughtful she can be.
It's the only park in our neighborhood.
I mean, where are my kids supposed to play, the rock quarry?
There's rocks in there.
Why don't we just set fire to the fence?
You know, set it ablaze.
That's arson.
Well, let's leave that up to the lawyers.
The point is, it would work.
Why don't we build a fence around their fence?
Why?
It would give us two fences, so if they needed to get to their fence for maintenance and whatnot, their pants might get caught.
My son Joey tried to scale that fence to play on the Eagleton side, and he fell and hurt his arm.
You need to get those people to tear that fence down.
This woman's right.
I promise you, citizens of Pawnee, and sweet, brave Joey, I will tear down that fence.
Okay, I'm just gonna suggest one more time that we burn it down.
But whatever you guys think.
Yeah.
Great.
Yes, hi.
I have a question about your inflatable saxophones.
Do those come in different sizes?
I'm gonna need about 40 dozen of those.
Also, what about your neon gangster fedora hats?
That was rude.
Whatever's going on here, stop it immediately.
I was just talking on the phone.
To whom?
It was personal.
I would never make a work-related call.
You know that.
Lindsay!
Leslie Knope.
Hi.
Hi.
Has it really been five years?
It has.
You look amazing.
Thank you.
This place hasn't changed a bit.
Still loveable, but grimy.
Hello, there.
I'm Ben Wyatt.
I'm assistant city manager Hi, Dan.
Ben.
It's not important.
It won't come up again.
This is Ann.
She is my best friend.
Hi.
Now.
And she's a nurse, and she works at a hospital.
Oh.
Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry.
It's just, nursing You must be so tired and sad.
It's really nice outside.
Shall we speak in my courtyard?
Yeah.
Well, thank you so much for stopping by.
I was passing through Pawnee anyway.
I do a lot of charity work here.
There's only so much you can do.
You know, I found a picture of you from back in the day.
Oh.
Look at that.
Let me get a closer look.
So let's talk about Lafayette Park.
Oh, yes.
The fence.
I'm only trying to protect our children.
Come on, Lindsay, this isn't you.
When we used to work here together, we loved the fact that parks were for everyone.
That's what makes them so great.
You know what's really great?
A private park that's not for everyone.
Wowsers.
What do you care?
It's just a crappy little park.
Well, someone once told me that there's no such thing as small parks, just small ideas.
Hmm.
And that someone was this woman.
You can take it if you want.
I have many copies and the negatives.
And I have a JPEG.
The fence stays up.
Lindsay, if we Sweetie, and I mean this in the nicest possible way, Pawnee is and always will be a dirty, little nightmare from which you will never wake up.
But it was good seeing you.
What?
I'm not asleep.
I'm awake.
I'm wide awake, and I got my eyes on you.
That's what I would've said if I had thought of it in the moment.
What did I say instead?
Wow!
This is where they have their public forums?
Yeah, it's not that great.
They had a valet.
Yes, Eagleton is nicer than Pawnee.
And, yes, because of their cupcake factory, the air always smells like vanilla.
Oh, yeah.
Wow.
But their people are not inherently better than our people.
The only thing they beat us in is life expectancy, beauty pageants, and average income.
Who cares?
Factoid alert.
Eagleton was founded by former Pawneeans.
Pawnee was established in May of 1817.
And by July, finding the smell unpleasant and the soil untenable, all the wealthy people evacuated to Eagleton.
Hello, Pawnee.
Welcome to our public forum.
Hi, I'm Thomas Montgomery Haverford.
Okay.
Well, nice outfit.
What, did you just come from the stables?
Yes.
I was just at the stables.
You look like you've been working hard.
You have a million fly-aways right now.
Would you like to borrow a mirror or a self-help book?
I would not.
I would like you to get off your high horse, Lindsay.
Pun intended.
You know if I had your job, there would be no fence there.
Well, you don't have my job because you knew you couldn't handle it.
The forum is beginning.
We've got a little bit of Eagleton business, and then I'll introduce you.
Great.
Look how pretty the people are.
Hey, Ron.
How's the street parking at your house?
What?
Can you handle, like, 20 cars or a double-decker party bus?
There is no street parking at my house.
My house is not even on a street.
Do you have space for, like, a huge circus tent?
Hey, Ron.
Have you seen What the hell?
No!
Oh!
Well, looks like there won't be any balloons for the birthday boy.
These were for a sick child at the hospital.
My office, now.
I don't work for you.
Don't care.
Decisions, decisions.
I think I'm gonna go with the porcini mushrooms and boursin, s'il vous plaît.
that the Eagleton-Pawnee fence does a lot more harm than it does good.
Hello.
I'm Bertram Rolands, a citizen of Eagleton.
With all due respect, Ms. Knope, can't you just clean up your side of the park, put some new equipment there?
Well, we would love to do that, but, unfortunately, money is tight right now.
Hello.
I'm Christine Porter.
I want to respectfully say that I'm in favor of the fence.
I see it as a kind of punishment for Pawnee that might inspire your town to clean up its act.
Well, I would like to respectfully say that any child should be able to play in any park, regardless of wealth or status.
Anyway, this is Joey Plunkett.
Joey, wave to the audience.
Oh, you can't, because you broke your arm climbing that fence.
I can wave with this arm.
No, you can't.
Both your arms are broken.
All due respect, I recognize that boy.
He was caught selling fireworks to Eagleton kids.
Well, with more due respect, a lot of boys do that in our town.
You cannot be sure that he is the one.
This is a perfect example of how we're going to help you.
Here's to you, Joey, and your mother and to every Pawnee citizen who might have a bright future if they fundamentally change everything about themselves.
Thanks to Leslie Knope.
I'm not done.
Isn't she trying her hardest?
So cute and so good.
I'm only gonna ask you this once.
What is going on with my birthday?
Oh, my God.
Ron, it's your birthday.
Happy Birthday.
Shut your damn mouth.
This is a fun conversation.
Just tell me what Leslie is planning.
Honestly, I don't know.
I haven't heard anything.
Why don't you tell me what she did for your last birthday?
Oh, well, that was intense.
She totally surprised me.
She kidnapped me from work, and then she took me to that place, Señor Vega's, you know, where the mariachi band comes out.
They put a big sombrero on you, and then everybody sings "Happy Birthday"?
Damn it.
And then we went back to my house, and she invited basically everyone I knew, and she had this great guy doing face painting, and I had my face painted like a fairy tiger.
Ugh.
Also, she did it, like, a week before my birthday, which is genius, 'cause I had no idea it was coming.
And then there was a bouncy castle.
Did you know they made those for adults?
Mmm-hmm.
Maybe I'll change it up this time.
Can I try the andouille sausage?
Tom, let's go.
What?
No.
Hey, not you too.
It's gross.
I don't like it.
It's disgusting.
Did you guys get your public forum gift bag?
There's an iPod touch in here.
Man, she used to not be like this.
Eagleton really changed her.
Yeah, what exactly happened between the two of you, anyway?
Five years ago, Eagleton offered me that job.
And you said no?
Are you insane?
I talked it over with Lindsay, and we made a pact that we would stay in Pawnee together and work hard and fight to make Pawnee a better place to live.
And then they offered her the job, and she took it and disappeared.
Wow.
Verbena-scented soy candles!
You want me to do what, now?
Send Leslie somewhere on an assignment, a conference or something, and make her take April and freeze their bank accounts.
I don't understand.
Is Leslie's work unsatisfactory?
No, it has nothing to do with her work.
I don't want to get into it.
Ron, look, this is me, okay?
You know you can talk to me about anything.
Well, it's my birthday on Friday.
Hey!
Happy Birthday.
I'm ending this right now.
I'm just gonna leave early and go home.
Unless That's exactly what she wants me to do.
All right, everybody just grab a bag and open it up and then try to find some dirty stuff in there.
What are you doing?
Eagleton treats us like garbage.
We're gonna treat them like garbage.
We're gonna take these bags of trash, and we're gonna throw it over to their side of the park.
And then we're just gonna let the stink and the raccoons run wild.
Well, isn't that just playing right into what they think of you?
Oh, my God.
What am I thinking?
Let's just stop this.
Put everything back in the truck.
Let's back it up.
No, no, no, no.
Leslie, you promised we could throw garbage everywhere.
Wow.
I didn't expect to see the whole Parks Department here, although it is, sadly, one of the nicest spots in town.
I am so sick of this, Lindsay.
Wait, Leslie.
I've got this.
You listen to me, Lindsay Carlisle Shay.
Why don't you take your fancy dog, get in your Escalade, and if you have any job openings, maybe you should let me know about 'em.
Come on, man.
No!
I'm sick of being treated like I'm not willing to relocate to Eagleton, because I am!
So here's what you could do, lady.
Take this resume and shove it into your human resources slot.
Oh, yeah!
Shove it there!
No.
You might have a fancy car and a mahogany purse, or whatever rich people have, but I remember something that you're trying to forget.
You're a Pawnee girl.
No, Leslie, I'm not.
Well, then why do you come here at dinnertime and get takeout from the legendary J.J.'s Diner?
It's not for me.
These waffles make great dog laxatives.
Don't you dare feed that waffle to that dog to get it to poop.
Sambuca need to make?
There you go.
Leslie.
How dare you?
No!
- Get her, Leslie!
No!
Garbage fight!
Ugh!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
I need you guys to come to the Snakehole Lounge tonight to help me with something.
Yeah, no, tonight's not good.
No can do.
I'm on a cleanse.
Please.
This is important.
I'm launching my new high-end, Kahlua-style liqueur, Snake Juice.
Sounds like you took a snake and twisted it like a rag until its blood and guts came out.
What does Kahlua-style mean?
I mix a bunch of alcohol together, I add some sugar and coffee and some other junk, and it kind of tastes like Kahlua.
I can only drink warm tap water with cayenne pepper.
Fine.
Then don't drink it.
Just get other people to drink it, okay?
Meeting in one hour.
If you don't make it, you're on my Done-zo list.
What's a "Done-zo list"?
It means you and I are done-zo.
Hanging out, getting food together, done-zo.
You want to come over to my house and play video games?
Done-zo.
Hey, Tom, you want to come play Putt-Putt with me?
No, we're done-zo.
Babe, we got to make that meeting.
All right, let's start with the personal stuff.
How's Jessie?
Who?
The photographer guy.
Oh, yeah.
We broke up.
I didn't tell you that?
Uh-uh.
Why?
I liked him.
Yeah, I did, too.
I just I couldn't deal with his face.
Do you think I could get that book back that I loaned him?
Oh, well, I'm technically out of the country.
So I would have to call him from a weird number.
Sorry.
Oh.
Never mind.
But I'm seeing this new guy, Mattias.
You would love him.
He's a triple Pisces.
Oh, looks like someone's gonna be late for her meeting.
Race you.
Really?
Isn't that a little childish?
Bye, Ann.
Sorry, got to go.
Hey, move!
Councilman Howser, sorry.
Nice to see you as always.
Bye.
Welcome to Guerilla Marketing 101.
What is Guerilla Marketing?
A few ordinary schmoes, no offense, have a casual conversation next to some guy about how great Snake Juice is.
Next thing you know that guy orders a whole bottle of Snake Juice, and he has no idea why.
Ron is going to play our exciting Snake Juice drinker, A.K.A. Brian Thunder.
Jerry, you'll be playing a boring beer drinker.
Your name will be Jerry.
Your talking points are high-end, VIP, lifestyle.
All right, let's run through it once.
And action!
"The weather has been so weird lately.
"Hey, let me buy you all a drink".
"I'll take something basic like a beer".
"Yeah, I'm pretty "boring.
"So I'll take a beer, too".
"Not me.
I want this night to get K-razzy".
"Ca-razy".
Like "crazy".
"I want this night to get crazy.
"Get me a shot of Snake Juice.
I hear it has a dope aftertaste".
All right, that's gonna be a cut.
Um Ron, you got to say it like you mean it.
I won't publicly endorse a product unless I use it exclusively and I really believe in it.
My only official recommendations are U.S. Army-issued mustache trimmers, Morton Salt, and the C.R. Laurence Fein two-inch, axe-style scraper oscillating knife blade.
We need to find a new PR Director for the Health Department.
Dennis Cooper was fired today.
Why?
Short answer, he went bananas.
Long answer, his wife, Jan, had an affair, gave him a venereal disease, and so he put signs about her all through City Hall.
I'm sure you've seen them.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
"Jan Cooper will give you Chlamydia.
"Brought to you by the Pawnee Health Department".
"Chlamydia affects nearly 100% of Jan Coopers".
"The Department of Health congratulates Jan Cooper.
"Miss Chlamydia".
"Jan, I love you.
Please come back.
"I realize that I'm not blameless here.
"Please.
"Brought to you by the Health Department".
"Re-elect Jan Cooper.
Mayor of Whoreville".
Leslie, I want you to help us choose a replacement.
Parks and Health work closely together on outdoor programs and exercise initiatives.
Ann should do it.
Ann Perkins?
Pawnee is looking for a new PR Director for the Health Department, and I submitted your name.
You have an interview tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Yes, I know.
I couldn't get it earlier.
I'm Grateful.
I know.
You can thank me later.
But first, you need to go over your homework.
These are all the health initiatives the city has ever undertaken since the 1960s.
So you need to partially memorize that.
And it's gonna be a long night, so I got you some energy drinks and some chocolate-covered espresso beans and the book Freedom by Jonathan Franzen.
Why am I reading this?
Because I'm almost done with it, Ann.
And I want to talk to you about Patty.
Okay, deep breath.
Okay.
I've been a nurse for over 10 years.
It's not something you just quit.
I understand.
I just think with this new job, you could make a difference.
Make real change happen.
Plus, we'd be working in the same building.
No more lightning-round catch-up sessions.
It would be nice to have an office.
And let's be honest, it would be nice to not have to pull strange things out of people's butts every night.
You've mentioned that before.
That doesn't happen that often.
It happened once.
Just once.
That already is too many times.
I hate talking to people about things.
This is a nightmare.
I'm grouchy.
Well, we have to support Tom.
Think about it as role-playing.
That makes it sexy.
That could be fun.
Really?
Can I use a weird voice and try to freak people out?
Yes.
Okay.
Then next time you see me, I'll be a stranger.
Snake Juice!
What?
Here?
High-end, VIP, exclusive.
Hey, how's it going?
I think it's going okay.
People better buy this stuff, or else I'm gonna be screwed.
It's gonna be fine.
People will definitely buy it.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
"K" to the "N" to the "O-P-E," she's the dopest little shorty in all Pawnee, Indiana Why didn't you just stop at "Pawnee"?
Leslie Knope, seriously, you get sexier every day.
And that is not a line.
That is for real.
Oh, Jean-Ralphio.
Well, I know tonight's gonna be a big success, and I wish I could stay.
I really do, but I have to go help Ann.
She's gonna be up all night cramming for a big job interview.
She might be up all night, but I think someone else is gonna be doing the cramming.
Uh-oh!
Hey.
Hey.
I'm so happy to see you.
And I'm seeing you here.
Yes.
Yes, I'm surprised.
I thought maybe you'd be home preparing for tomorrow.
Oh, well, there was way too much stuff for me to read tonight, anyway.
I mean, it was a ridiculous amount of stuff that you gave me.
Oh.
But you are going in for the interview tomorrow?
I think so.
Uh-oh.
Is there enough room for some "man-aise" in this lady sandwich?
Oh.
Leslie, this is my friend Howard Tuttleman.
Oh, please.
Call me "The Douche".
You probably know me from my morning radio show on 93.7, "Crazy Ira and The Douche".
Yeah, I had met you before.
I actually was on your show once Wait!
Were you on the show where we had that stripper do math?
Classic, right?
Hello, strange person who I have never met before.
Who are you?
I'm Janet Snakehole.
I'm a very rich widow with a terrible secret.
Who are you?
Bert Macklin, FBI.
I was the best damn agent they had until I was framed for a crime I didn't commit.
Stealing the President's rubies.
Now I work alone.
Lovely to meet you.
I got to admit, I thought your costume would maybe be a little bit sluttier.
How dare you?
Nice.
Gentlemen.
Swan song.
How you living?
Yes.
Why aren't you holding a Snake Juice?
I'm more of a whiskey man.
Ron-Ron, come here.
Come here for a bit.
You're good right there.
Listen, you got to jump on the Tommy Town Express.
This guy has some of the best investment ideas I've ever heard in my life.
Make a baby tuxedo clothing line.
A department store with a guest list.
White fur ear muffs for men.
Contact lenses that display text messages.
Invent a phone that smells good.
Own a night club called Eclipse that's only open for one hour two times a year.
Cover charge, $5,000.
I can keep going.
How about this, Ron?
Try Snake Juice.
If you like it, you got to talk it up all night.
If you don't, I'll shave Jean-Ralphio's head.
Yeah, I'd like to see that.
Hit me.
A lot riding on this.
Damn, if that isn't delicious.
"R" to the "O" to the "N" I say Swanson's got swagger the size of a Big Ben clock Dude, you got to end it on the rhyme.
I know what I have to do.
You had it at "Ben".
I know.
I got it.
You think I haven't been around the world?
I've been everywhere, darling.
I'm a very wealthy woman.
My husband's kept me in the finest clothes from Bergdorf Goodman, you see.
Freeze!
FBI!
No!
Leave me alone!
Hands in the air!
I didn't kill anybody!
And I didn't burn down the mill either.
My sister did.
But now she's been eaten by wolves!
Nothing to see here.
So how did you two meet?
We met at the supermarket.
I used my classic pickup line.
"If you're looking for douches, they're in Aisle Me".
Awesome.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, by the way, I don't think I can get that book back from what's -his-name.
Oh, that's okay.
I mean, I should've known better than to loan something to one of your boyfriends.
They come and go so fast.
What are you saying exactly?
Well, I mean, let's be honest.
How long is it gonna last with this guy?
Sitting right here.
I don't know.
He's dumb, but he's fun.
Thank you.
I mean, that's the whole point of dating around is you get to try on a bunch of different hats.
Well, this hat is an idiot.
Classic.
Leslie, are you mad that I came here?
What?
No.
I'm not Are you You seem mad at me.
No, I'm not I'm not mad at you.
I'm not mad at you.
I'm not mad at all.
Neither am I. No.
Looks like you two need to kiss and make up.
All right.
Hello.
My name is Ron Swanson.
In general, I try never to speak with people, but I have been drinking this Snake Juice thing, and it's damn good.
You should buy it.
Yeah, okay.
Thanks, man.
Son, you should know that my recommendation is essentially a guarantee.
Drink this, now.
Traegermeister!
You made it.
Yeah, I got your email.
We need to talk.
First off, though, try a little Snake Juice.
It's 140 proof, which means it's 70% alcohol.
But don't worry.
There's plenty of caffeine in it to keep you awake.
I believe an ounce of that would literally kill me.
You emailed everyone at City Hall and told them to come to a club that you own to buy alcohol that you invented.
Government employees can't use their power to enhance their personal wealth.
I totally get your point, Chris.
It won't happen again.
I just don't see any way around it.
You're gonna have to sell your shares in the Snakehole.
No!
T-Pain, this guy bothering you?
This is my boss.
Okay, yeah.
You want me to write a rap about your name?
Yes.
"B" to the "O" to the double "S," do what he say, and you'll be successful No offense, but maybe you think I'm going too fast 'cause you're going too slow with Ben.
No offense, but I'm going slow because I might lose my job.
Okay, no offense, but maybe that's a little bit of an excuse for not acting on your feelings.
No offense, but I don't remember you having a nursing degree in feelings.
Offense!
That's rude.
I'm gonna go dance.
Douche, you're up.
Hey, are you okay?
I heard yelling.
Yeah, I'm very angry, and I'm really drunk.
Do you want to dance with me?
Go get me another "Snork Juice".
Oh, that's maybe not the best idea for you.
Forget it.
Jean-Ralphio!
Yes, I'm here.
Dance up on me.
Yes, yes, yes.
This is my first fight with Ann, and it's a doozy.
But I believe that honest discussions between friends can lead to deeper intimacy.
This is a watershed moment in our relationship, and it's important that we fight clean.
All I need to do is focus and stay calm.
You're stupid, and you're drunk and you're stupid.
I don't understand how this is my fault.
It's not Everything isn't your fault all the time.
Don't always make everything your fault.
Good!
It's not all my fault.
I'm not the stupid jerk.
I'm not the one who's being a stupid jerk right now.
I didn't mean it like that.
You know I didn't mean it like that.
I just meant you were being stupid, and you were acting like a jerk.
Look, I'm sorry that I thought about you for the job, okay?
But sometimes if I don't push you in the right direction, you end up standing still.
I was just trying to do you a favor.
Enough with your favors, okay?
Stop.
Maybe we shouldn't work together, then.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Every time I cleanse, I can literally feel the toxins leaving my body.
I know!
I feel so much healthier.
I've still got a full week to go before the broth stage.
Pre-broth is an amazing stage.
It's when you're most alert.
Good.
Someone needs to be alert tonight.
This Snake Juice is basically rat poison.
Everybody's wasted.
You don't even know one thing.
I didn't even say one thing.
And then she asked me the whole thing, and I didn't even do it once.
I'm like an elephant, okay?
If I walk into a room, it's like, okay, he's in there.
Bababooey.
Turn this music down.
Farts and poop and love and stuff Macaroni salad Is this everybody?
Ann took a cab.
Tom's in the trunk.
Jerry's on the roof.
All right, where to first?
Your mother's butt.
I'm so alone.
If even one of you thinks about dry-heaving in my car, you're all walking home.
Leslie.
I'm here.
We have to go hire a new PR Director for the Health Department.
Oh, my God.
I'm so hung over.
I've never been this hung over.
I feel great.
I ran five k this morning.
Really?
No, I threw up in the shower.
Top of the morning, everyone.
I brought some burgers and fries.
Eat up.
The protein soaks up the sugar.
First, you take the cow to the killing floor Well, I am out of questions.
Thank you.
We will let you know.
Then our heads will explode, and we will die.
Oh, God.
I cannot believe that fight I had with Ann.
Look, I'm sure you guys can work it out.
I owe her, like, a million apologies.
I think I owe you one, too.
I'm sorry.
For what?
I don't know.
Are you okay?
No, I'm sad.
Say, thanks, chum.
I'll get those papers delivered for you.
Whatever.
Post-haste.
The doctor says it's probably not serious, but it might be.
Oh, Kyle, please stop talking.
Why, isn't it Bert Macklin?
What are you doing here, and who is this sorry charlie?
I'm Janet Snakehole.
I demand answers, and I want them now.
Honey, please.
I love you.
No offense, but Bert Macklin died last night after the tenth shot of Snake Juice.
Okay, sorry.
Miss Snakehole.
You think I'd let you get away that easily?
Bert Macklin may be dead, but I'm his brother Kip Hackman.
Why wouldn't you have his same last name?
Shut up, Kyle.
I know you boosted those paintings.
Maybe it was me, but I'll never tell you where they are.
And you'll never have my body either.
Sorry to hear the news, Tom.
We're gonna miss you around the club.
Hey, you own shares, too.
Why didn't Chris make you sell?
'Cause Chris doesn't know.
You know what?
Snitches get stitches.
Donna, come on.
Don't.
I'm a natural moneymaker.
I got into government for the connections.
This was supposed to be a thing that led to the other thing.
It's like when Vin did Boiler Room.
That's what led to him being xXx and doing Furious.
And Furious.
Yeah, I know.
Listen, I don't like all this negativity, man.
Why don't you turn that "frizz-own" "upside-dizzity".
Huh?
This sucks, man.
You're wearing snow pants.
I got home last night, and I thought I might go sledding.
Can I come in?
Yeah, if you're quiet.
Okay.
Uh, Leslie doesn't know I'm here.
Oh, God.
So high school.
I can't believe that Leslie and I got drunk in a bar and fought about boys.
We're so much better than that.
I just keep having flashes of things that we said to each other.
And she's so important to me.
I feel like such a dick.
I know she feels awful.
I mean, technically, we all do.
Yeah.
What the hell is in Snake Juice, Demerol?
All I know is Leslie's always talking about how lucky she is to have you as a friend.
And I just wanted you to know that.
You're nice.
I can see why she likes you.
When did she say Likes me?
Oh, God.
This is so high school.
Just rent a limo, ask her to the prom.
I'm sure she'll say yes.
All right.
Thanks.
So let me get this straight.
Tom tries to get off the government teat, and we punish him.
That doesn't make any sense to me.
I'm sorry.
Rules are rules.
I wish there was something we could do.
Ben, is there something we can do?
Damn it.
Ben's not here.
Tom's not scamming anyone.
He's not savvy enough to manipulate the system like that.
He's just a kid chasing a goofy dream.
I'm sorry.
My hands are tied.
Jan Cooper was a terrible wife.
I just want everybody to know that.
Thank you, Dennis.
But we can't give you your job back.
You sound just like her.
That was unpleasant.
Yeah.
All right, who's next?
You came.
Yeah, I had some encouragement.
Your sweater's on inside out.
And backwards.
It's been a tough morning.
Lots of regret and shame.
That should be the official slogan for Snake Juice.
Well, this committee would like to ask if you are the kind of candidate who could forgive someone after they've behaved like a complete jackass?
This candidate could, especially because this candidate also behaved like a total jackass.
Please, don't worry about it.
The committee totally understands.
Also, I can talk about my qualifications for this position.
But first, I am gonna go throw up in a wastebasket.
Would you mind if I joined you?
Not at all.
Shall we?
Ann came in the next day and had a second interview with Chris.
Great.
She nailed it, of course.
But she doesn't want to totally leave her job.
So they struck up a deal.
She works at City Hall part-time, and two days a week, she still gets to be the greatest nurse in the world.
Win-win.
We need to remember what's important in life.
Friends, waffles, and work.
Or waffles, friends, work.
It doesn't matter.
But work is third.
So listen, Crazy Ira, check this out, okay?
I'm at this club last night just killing it, the Snakehole Lounge.
Oh, yeah, is that a gay club?
Hello?
Shut up, ass.
Come on, man.
So I'm dancing on the floor with this super-hot chick.
Me so horny.
More like a dude, I bet.
Hello?
Did you wet your whistle?
- I wish.
- Me likey.
No, no, no, no.
She spent the whole night talking to her friend, arguing about their feelings.
That's me!
Who knows?
She's probably a lesbian.
They were in the bathroom a long time.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Hey, Leslie.
Hey.
Thank you for that year-over-year maintenance cost analysis.
That was really helpful.
You're so welcome.
I was thinking about you when I wrote it.
'Cause I was, um 'Cause I told you I wanted to read it?
Yeah.
That's a good reason.
Anyway, Chris wants to see us in his office.
I guess we should head over there.
All right.
All right.
All right, cool.
Great.
See you there.
I'll see you there, Benjamin.
Ben.
All right, "Lesliemin".
Leslie.
Hi, Ben.
Oh, hey, Ann.
Wow!
That was the most sexual tension I have ever seen in a conversation about documents.
It can't happen.
We could both get fired.
That's a dumb rule.
I know!
Well, if you have to follow it, I would just suggest avoiding one-on-one, tension-y situations with him.
You're right.
Good plan.
I am sending you two on a trip.
Really?
Really?
The Indiana Little League Baseball Tournament is upon us, and Pawnee hasn't hosted it in 20 years.
So, I would like you two to go to Indianapolis and state our case, because you two are my dynamic duo.
Right here.
Ah Ah And go team!
Yep.
Ann, everything you have is too sexy.
This is actually the dress that Julia Roberts wore as a prostitute in Pretty Woman.
I know.
I look really good in it.
I need, like, a sweat suit or something.
I need to send out a signal that nothing is gonna happen.
Oh, this is insane.
It's so obvious you're dying to be together.
And now you're going on a road trip?
I mean, you guys could literally "get a room".
Yeah, and I could literally get "a-fired".
All right, I will help you anti-seduce him.
Just tell me what else you need.
I need to think of unsexy, boring conversation topics we can talk about in the car.
I have a few ideas.
We could discuss The New Yorker article "The History of the Ladder".
Okay.
We could talk about different dorms at Johns Hopkins University, and I could read from my Sonicare booklet.
Oh, I have a good idea!
What?
Why don't you ask him about his penis?
Pawnee Zoo, monkey speaking.
Okay!
Everyone stop what you're doing and come with me.
All four of you.
Where are you going?
Leslie's not here today.
No boss.
We can do whatever we want.
I'm your boss.
That's a good one, Ron.
Let's go.
Seriously.
Come on.
Here's the sitch.
I developed a dope new game show where I ask couples scandalous questions, and they have to guess what the other one answered.
I call this Know Ya Boo.
Oh, that sounds like The Newlywed Game.
Shut up, Jerry!
It's not The Newlywed Game, okay?
It is totally The Newlywed Game.
But big deal.
Everyone steals.
My favorite movie is Love Don't Cost a Thing, with Nick Cannon, which is based on Can't Buy Me Love, which is based on Kramer vs.
Kramer or something, which I think was Shakespeare.
Don't know, don't care.
And what exactly do you plan on doing with this game show idea?
Are you going to shove it up your butt?
No.
I'm gonna test it out on you four bing-bongs and work out the kinks, then hire actual attractive people, and make a demo.
What network is gonna buy a game show from you?
There's a million networks out there, and they all need programming.
Spike, G4, GSN, Fuse, WOW, Boom, Zip, Kablam, Slurp, Slurp Latin, Slurp HD.
I love Slurp HD.
Have you guys seen Ultimate Battle Smoothie?
That's a dope show.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, so, basically every dorm allows bed lofting, but the students have really taken to it at Wolman and McCoy.
Did you go to Johns Hopkins?
No.
Do you wanna play some music?
Sure!
Ann and I burned an awesome CD for the trip.
Jimmy Carter's "Crisis of Confidence" speech, Learning to Speak Mandarin, 16 minutes of Old Timey Car Horn, and something called Banjo Boogie Bonanza.
It's an amazing instrument, the banjo.
Yeah.
I didn't realize it could be this loud.
Hello?
Hello?
Can I help you?
Hi.
My class is here on a field trip, and I'm supposed to interview someone for a school project.
Okay.
You can wait at that table, and someone will be here sometime.
But aren't you here now?
No.
It's time to know your I don't have the instrumental backing track yet, but it's gonna say "boo" right there.
Hey, everybody!
Welcome to Know Ya Boo.
I'm your host, Tom Haverford, and with me as always is my CGI puppy co-host, Bobby the Boo!
Hey, everybody!
All right, let's get to it.
First question.
Fellas, which rock star would your lady bang if she could bang one rock star?
Jerry!
I believe I have heard Donna talk about Prince, a lot.
What'd your boo say?
Impressive!
All right, Andy, which rock star would your lady get with?
Um, this is almost too easy.
Me!
Let's check in with your boo!
Yay!
Oh!
Sorry.
Who is Jeff Mangum?
The guy from Neutral Milk Hotel.
Oh!
Oh.
Neutral Milk Hotel.
What is that?
That's my favorite band.
I've told you that, like, a thousand times.
I don't remember.
Why wouldn't you pick me?
I don't know.
You're not technically a rock star.
Booyah!
Somebody don't know their boo!
That's the sound bite that's gonna play when a fight breaks out.
Look, little girl, can we postpone this for another day?
It's unsettling having you just sit there.
But my report's due tomorrow.
What's it on?
Why government matters.
Really?
It's never too early to learn that the government is a greedy piglet that suckles on a taxpayer's teat until they have sore, chapped nipples.
I'm gonna need a different metaphor to give this nine-year-old.
What's your name, ma'am?
Lauren Burkiss.
Lauren, my name is Ron Swanson, and I'm gonna tell you everything you need to know about the miserable, screwed-up world of local government.
You have mustard in your mustache.
Don't sass me, Burkiss.
Let's get started.
"Life, liberty, and property".
That's John Locke.
What is this?
Whale sounds.
Okay.
You can change it if you want.
Yeah?
What the hell?
Oh, no, no, no.
This is such a great song.
Yeah, I snuck an Al Green song in there.
I want them to get together.
Sue me.
Did you see this?
According to their rules, we may not have enough hotel rooms within city limits.
I know.
It's a silly rule.
But maybe they'll be reasonable and not care.
Yeah, maybe we could just point out to them there are tons of hotel rooms just outside city limits.
Uh-huh.
Have you been to the Granville Hotel and Spa?
Uh-uh.
They have the softest towels.
Oh, I gotta tell you.
I love a nice towel in my life.
Me too.
I know.
I mean, it's the simplest luxury, but it makes all the difference.
Their bath mats are amazing.
It's like stepping on a lamb.
Oh, hold on.
Hey, come here.
You've got an eyelash on your face.
I got it.
Make a wish.
Learning to speak Mandarin.
Unit three.
Get away from me.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
I'm allergic to fingers.
Where are you going?
Maybe we should just not talk to each other for the rest of the trip, and I'm just gonna concentrate on the presentation.
Okay.
This is my little brother.
Next up.
The delegation from Pawnee, please?
And, so, as you can see, Pawnee has 12 beautiful baseball diamonds, and our seats have extra cushioning due to the massive size of our average citizen.
I have to bring up what happened the last time Pawnee hosted this tournament.
No, you don't.
Good evening.
We begin with our first story tonight.
They're cute, they're cuddly, but now they're wreaking havoc at the State Little League Championship.
Pawnee's raccoon infestation.
Have these little bandits stolen our sense of safety?
The raccoon problem is under control.
They have their part of the town, and we have ours.
Muncie is larger.
Bloomington is more central.
What's the advantage of doing it in Pawnee?
The advantage is that it's a wonderful city.
I mean, look, I've been to and Pawnee is special.
I mean, the people are passionate and kind.
They love their city.
They take pride in their work.
It's a very, very special place.
Hey, it's Tom Haverford back here with Know Ya Boo.
Let's move to the next question.
Where is your favorite place to smush your boo?
Donna!
Back of my Benz?
Let's check in with your boo!
He said, "Her Mercedes"!
Jerry and Donna on fire.
April?
This question is gross.
That's kind of the point.
What's your answer?
In our bed, I guess.
Andy?
Where's your boo's favorite place to smush?
Get over it.
No, you get over it.
You like some other dude's band more than me.
Do you even think Mouse Rat is the greatest band in the world?
'Cause it's starting to not feel that way.
That band is really important to me.
And, honestly, I've asked you to listen to them, like, a million times, and you never have, so 'Cause their music is sad, and depressing, and weird.
And art is supposed to be happy and fun, and everyone knows that.
You know what?
Whatever.
Forget it.
Fine, forget it.
Damn!
This game's got juice.
This is your lunch.
Now, you should be able to do whatever you want to with this, right?
If you wanna eat all of it, great.
If you wanna throw it away in the garbage, that's your prerogative.
But here I come, the government, and I get to take And that, Lauren, is how taxes work.
But that's not fair.
You're learning.
Uh-oh.
Capital gains tax.
Well, Chris says congratulations and that together we're unstoppable.
Wow, cheers, sir!
Yup.
You did it.
No, you did it.
No, normally I do it.
This time, you did it.
Well, all right.
You should take the praise.
Can I get a shot of you guys?
Yeah.
Sure.
Hey, when this thing's over, do you wanna grab some dinner?
Chris recommended a place.
Sure.
Yeah?
Hey, we were thinking about going to dinner, photographer.
You want in?
You wanna grab some grub?
Uh, no, thanks.
They have great burgers.
Well, you don't even know where we're going yet.
I'm sure they have great burgers there, though.
Come on, photographer.
Last chance.
Okay.
Well, then, it's just us then.
Yeah.
Sure.
Okay.
I tried.
And that, Lauren, is how FDR ruined this country.
Lauren, ready to head back?
Well, I guess it's time for you to head home.
I've really enjoyed talking with you.
You are, and this is not a joke, much smarter than most of the people who work in this building.
I liked talking with you, too, Mr. Swanson.
Ron.
Hang on, hang on, I have something for you.
This is a Claymore land mine.
Use that to protect your property.
Thanks, Ron.
You got it.
Tommy Hilfiger iPhone app, finally.
Hey, your stupid Know Your Boo game made me and Andy get in a big fight.
He just sold his guitar, and he's, like, quitting music now.
What do you want me to do about it?
Okay, welcome to the super awesome bonus lightning round.
First question.
Andy, who did your boo say makes the best mac and cheese in the universe?
The universe?
Kraft?
April said Best couple ever.
You just won 50 points.
Wait, why?
We got it wrong.
Next lightning round thing.
Who is the number one Colts fan in the world?
Wait a minute.
You set this whole thing up so I would be un-mad at you.
Well, guess what, ain't gonna work.
You figured out April's trying to trick you.
That's worth 100 points.
Wait.
No.
Goodbye.
You were really great in that presentation today.
Oh, thanks.
I liked the stuff you said about Pawnee.
That was really nice to hear.
You know, Pawnee is a really special town.
I love living there.
And And I look forward to the moments in my day where I Where I get to hang out with the town and talk to the town about stuff.
And the town has really nice blond hair, too, and has read a shocking number of political biographies for a town, which I like.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
And I know we can get into trouble, but I can't take this anymore, and I feel like we have to at least talk about it.
I mean, it's not just me, right?
No, it's not just you.
Oh, God.
What?
Are you Are you all right?
Perfect.
I'm gonna go see a man about some porcelain, you know what I mean?
I'm not buying cocaine.
I'm going to the bathroom.
The whiz palace, as I like to call it.
And I'm not calling Ann, so Ann, we have a serious code Ben.
Well, it's not really code if you say his name.
He told me that he liked me, and I'm gonna go make out with him right now.
On his face.
That's awesome!
No, no.
Read me the script.
Seriously?
Yes!
All right.
"Leslie, it's Leslie Knope from the Parks Department "speaking to you through Ann Perkins, friend and beautiful nurse".
Thank you.
"Do not do anything with Ben.
"Be responsible, no matter how cute his mouth is.
"Your job is on the line"!
Shut up, Ann!
You wrote that.
No, you Then, Leslie, Leslie, you don't know what you're talking about.
I care about him very much, and I've had two and a half glasses of red wine, and what that means is I'm gonna go make out with him right now, and it's gonna be awesome.
Yay!
No, you're supposed to talk me out of this.
No.
Don't.
Stop.
Shut up, Ann, I'm doing it anyway.
Yay!
Leslie!
When Ben told me that you had won the bid, I was wildly ecstatic, and I had to come up here and celebrate with you.
There is literally nothing in this world that you cannot do.
So, what's the plan now?
Should we take a long walk?
Mini-golf.
I'll probably Shouldn't we just go back to Pawnee?
Yeah.
Nonsense.
There's no reason to drive all the way back home.
I've got a perfectly good condo right here in the city.
Oh, we couldn't put you out like that.
Double nonsense.
I would love to have you stay with me.
Leslie, you can take the guest room, and, Ben, you have to sleep on my couch.
It is literally the comfiest couch you've ever been on.
This is weird.
We're on Chris' couch.
Yep, we are.
And I'm wearing his clothes.
Well Well Sorry, I keep myself very well hydrated, and my bladder is the size of a thimble.
I urinate roughly I think I might go to bed, too, actually.
Oh, yeah?
Okay.
Well, look Good job, again, today.
It was You, too.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, that was quick and to the point.
Here's a tip.
The key to a healthy urethra, radishes.
Good, I'm gonna go to bed.
Good night.
Good night.
Well, now I'm up.
You wanna Boggle?
Are you Ron Swanson?
I am.
Okay, what exactly did you teach my daughter?
You must be Mrs. Burkiss.
Lauren was supposed to do a paper on why government matters.
This is what she wrote.
"It doesn't".
Well said.
Is this a joke?
No, ma'am.
I legitimately believe that.
I'm a libertarian.
Oh, that's nice.
Well, she is a fourth grader.
And fourth graders aren't supposed to have their heads crammed full of weird ideas.
They're supposed to do cute reports and get gold stars.
I'm very sorry.
I was only And you ate her lunch?
And you gave her a land mine?
Really?
Well, it seemed appropriate at the time.
I How?
You know this is my house, right?
Yeah, hi.
Do you wanna come in?
You okay?
No.
Andy is totally mad at me right now, and I don't know how to deal with him.
So I thought I would ask you.
You know, Andy and I broke up so long ago.
I don't think that I'd be the best source to Please.
What happened?
He doesn't think I like Mouse Rat.
All I said to him was that this other band was better, but I don't know why he got all mad, because it's like an indisputable fact that they're better.
They're a real band.
Oh, boy.
Okay.
Well, Andy just wants you to be proud of him and his music.
So, this isn't really about being right.
It's more about being supportive.
Oh, wow.
I didn't realize you were a marriage counselor, Ann.
Sorry.
My instinct is to be mean to you.
I understand.
O-M-G.
Leslie, I read that same article.
"The History of the Ladder".
It's utterly fascinating.
Ben, you're gonna love this.
Really?
Do you know that the original image of a ladder is in a cave in Valencia, Spain, drawn over 10,000 years ago.
Oh, my God.
How about some music?
This is amazing.
What is this?
Oh, man, I love this song.
The pit Wait a minute.
You were in the pit We all were in the pit The pit I was in the pit You were in the pit We all were in the pit What is this?
Living out my dream.
Playing a show with the greatest band ever.
That's my guitar.
You bought it back from Shoeless Joe?
I actually stole it from his office, but whatever.
He's a weirdo.
Maybe April doesn't think that we're the greatest band in the world, but, man, she loves me.
And I love her.
So, you know, who cares.
I got the greatest wife in the world!
Stop.
We're married!
We're totally gonna do it later!
Oh, my God.
Well, actually, I think it's good that Chris showed up, 'cause I wasn't thinking clearly.
I love my job, Ben loves his job, and it's just not worth the risk.
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Chris just wanted me to drop off these receipts.
Oh, well, he's not here.
He took off.
Okay.
Uh-oh.
All I'm saying is, keep an open mind for a while.
Listen to your teachers and read all the books you can.
Then when you're 18, you can drink, gamble and become a libertarian.
The drinking age is 21.
I know.
Another stupid government rule.
So you'll write a new paper?
Yeah.
Can you autograph this one for me?
Sure.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Hey, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever in her new part-time job in the Public Health Department at City Hall, it's Ann Meredith Perkins!
Yay!
Leslie, this is so nice!
I put a poisonous gas in one of these balloons, so if any of them pops, you may die.
No, April, we would all die.
Gases fill the volume of whatever container they're in.
School.
We have activities every hour on your first day.
day waffle explosion".
"The start-paperwork jamboree".
And then 12:00 noon sharp is the inaugural "D-Ann-ce Party".
Welcome to City Hall, cupcake!
How many of you are in here?
- There's seven.
And you have an office mate.
His name is Stuart, and he's kind of a grouch.
I have an office mate?
Get these balloons out of here.
Hi, I'm Ann.
Hey.
Hey.
Just to let you know, I gave the senior center project to Donna.
Sounds good.
The meeting's at 2:00?
Yes.
Conference room "C".
Okay.
I think at some point, you and I should probably make out with each other.
Yeah, good call.
The best part of any relationship is the beginning.
No problems, no fights.
Just white wine, cuddling, and crazy amounts of History Channel documentaries.
Hey, we should take separate cars to the restaurant tonight.
Chris is deadly serious about this I know.
I just don't wanna talk about it, okay?
I'll see you tonight.
Okay.
By the way, I have a meeting with Marlene Griggs-Knope.
Is that any relation?
No.
Oh, okay.
Just a coincidence.
We get it all the time.
We laugh about it.
But I've never met her.
She's Filipino.
Okay, bye.
Why don't you just tell Ben she's your mother?
Because Ben and I are in this amazing little bubble right now, and there's no room in here for Chris' stupid rules about us not dating or my ball-busting mother.
Leslie, I'm sorry, but I don't think you thought this through.
You know what I should do?
I should get my mother a one-way ticket to London, leaving today.
And that way, Ben never has to meet her and I could visit her in London.
Everybody wins.
What if he sees a picture of her on your desk?
What if Marlene says, "Hey, have you met my daughter, Leslie?
"She works in the Parks Department".
Stuart, please, could you give us, like, 45 minutes?
It's my office, too.
Stuart.
That guy was rude.
I feel that some structural changes could really unlock this department's potential.
Jerry.
Mmm?
I believe you are capable of much more.
I'm not.
Nonsense.
Look in the mirror.
Huh?
You are an intelligent, charismatic, beautiful superhero.
I'm making you head of Public Relations, which means you'll be leading the daily briefing sessions.
Excellent idea.
This is my favorite part about having a new city manager.
They always try to shake things up, and their ideas are terrible, and it brings City Hall to a grinding halt.
I just grab a few donuts, sit back, and enjoy the show.
April, you are too valuable to just be Ron's assistant.
So from now on, you are a multitasking executive aide, assisting the entire office.
Is this a nightmare?
April, wake up.
Tom, I just wanna say that you are a wonderful employee and a terrific human being.
Meeting adjourned!
Tom.
I enjoy you.
You know what else I enjoy?
Your entrepreneurial spirit.
I did recently sell my Chronicles of Riddick DVD on eBay for $10.
Used the profits to buy the Blu-ray.
That's terrific.
I have an amazing project for someone of your talents.
You are going to digitize the entire city archives up on the fourth floor.
No!
I hate the fourth floor!
Last time I was up there, I saw someone buy crystal meth out of a vending machine.
It's a bad place.
You won't be alone.
Andy.
Starting now, you are nobody's shoeshine boy.
Starting now, you are an administrative assistant.
For three weeks.
Then back to shoes.
Chris!
I wasn't super paying attention to what you just said that we'll be doing, but I will give Well, as soon as you repeat yourself in a more interesting way.
Hey, Ben.
Hey, what's up?
Nothing much.
Since I'm here, I just wanted to let you know that Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mom.
What?
Why Also, she can be cruel and difficult, and she makes snap judgments about people that she holds on to for a very long time.
And she's kind of a bully.
Okay!
Go in there, you're gonna be great.
God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
Here.
Sorry!
Hello.
I'm Mr. Ben Wyatt.
Looks like you got some shirt on your coffee.
Yeah.
You know what happened?
I spilled it, but you know how it goes.
Fun anecdote.
The county school district needs four new school buses.
I'm being stonewalled by the board, and I'm hoping your office can help us out.
Okay.
Really?
That's it?
Yeah.
Actually, no.
It It's probably not possible.
Then I'm confused, Ben, because you just told me it was.
Five seconds ago.
I got a second box of donuts, if anybody What the is this?
This, Mr. Director, is your new desk.
Okay.
This desk is the epitome of the Swedish concept of jämställdhet, or "equality".
Imagine someone needs your attention.
Somebody say my name.
Chris.
Swivel!
What is it, Jerry?
You told me to say your name.
And you did a great job, superstar.
Someone else say something.
You look like a freak.
Swivel!
April, that is not a very good attitude.
I will keep my eye on you from my circular desk where I can see everything.
Tiny swivel.
See how it works?
What about my office and its many walls?
That becomes a new public waiting room.
And we got rid of that giant pillar that was in front of your door.
I loved that pillar.
It made it really annoying to stand in my doorway.
Well, get over it, because it's gone.
You're gonna be more accessible than ever.
The fourth floor.
Small claims court, divorce filings, state-ordered drug tests.
It's somehow both freezing and humid.
There's a whole room on the fourth floor where they store the knives they've confiscated from people who went to the fourth floor to stab someone.
You from Parks and Rec?
Yeah.
I'm here to show you around.
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
What's your name?
Ethel Beavers.
Follow me.
Okay, this is you.
Oh, wow!
Double computers?
I get my own office phone.
Hello, Wall Street.
Buy more stocks.
Now.
This phone kind of smells like a butt.
Try not to move things around.
Because technically speaking, this is still a crime scene.
Here's your name tags.
Here.
Ethel, this shirt is from Theory.
Name tags make holes.
I'm not wearing this.
Do what you want.
Bye, Ethel!
Damn it.
Remind me next time to ask her where she was when Lincoln got shot.
"Remind Tom Ask Something".
You got it, boss.
Hey!
Somebody made somebody a mix!
And I definitely heard your feedback from last time, so I only put five Sarah McLachlan songs on this one.
Cool.
Should we talk about how you claimed your mom was a Filipino woman you'd never met?
Should we?
I was just trying to delay the inevitable.
If this turns into something real, then we are gonna have to deal with Chris' rule, and parents, and annoying flossing habits, and a lot of un-fun stuff.
But not yet.
I just want to enjoy the bubble for a little while.
I'm sorry.
Everything's good?
No, it's not.
I was completely flustered.
I came off like an idiot.
I mean, at one point, for no reason, I just took off my shoes and held them in my hand.
I'm gonna go ask her how it went, and I bet she loved you.
I loved him!
He's a total pushover.
Very odd guy, though.
He's like a goofy, spineless jellyfish.
Why do you ask, sweetheart?
No reason.
Don't worry about it.
It's totally fine.
No, it's not fine.
What if she starts going around telling people I'm a pushover?
No one's gonna believe that.
When I first met you, I thought you were a fascist hard-ass.
What?
A cute fascist hard-ass, but still, you give off a very Education Department now officially requesting 10 school buses.
I thought they only wanted four.
Well, now that I'm a pushover, why not ask for 10, or 20, or 100 new school buses and a fleet of school yachts?
How about that?
Here's what we're gonna do.
You are gonna tell me everything there is to know about your mom.
And I'm gonna have another meeting with her, and we're gonna have it out.
Or we could go to Belize and go scuba diving.
And we could look at the whale sharks.
You're certified, right?
Let's get you certified.
April, do you have that usage report that I asked for?
Anything for you, Jerry.
Thank you.
Oh, come on.
Why?
Excuse me.
There's a sign at Ramsett Park that says "Do not drink the sprinkler water," so I made sun tea with it, and now I have an infection.
Sir?
Sir, are Are you listening to me, sir?
Sir, I'm talking to you!
Sir!
Sir, are you aware that there is waste in your water system?
Okay, you need to be strong, powerful, decisive.
This is not a meeting.
It's a battle.
Normal meeting rules do not apply.
I'll be my mom and I'm gonna be very harsh with you, and it's only because I like you a lot.
Okay.
Go!
Hello.
Wrong.
What?
No preambles.
No introductions.
Just walk in and start talking.
I'd like to discuss the new school bus.
I'd like to discuss your rhyming, Dr. Seuss.
And you should be sitting by now.
What?
Just walk in and take a seat.
Um "Um" is the sound in "dumb".
That's what she says to people.
And now you've crossed your legs like a woman.
God!
Okay, should we just start over?
No.
No, we need to put a pin in this.
Here is a list of my mother's top starting with Persian rugs, ending with Daniel Craig.
You have 10 minutes to memorize it.
Deliverance, the movie?
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, God.
So Jerry is, like, basically my boss now, which I'm never gonna work for him.
Ron's trapped in this weird desk prison, and I now work at this traveling IV station.
This Mort Jansen's office?
Nope.
Tell Mort I said "Your move".
Oh, my God.
I wanna work up here with you guys.
This is awesome.
How many more of those stupid documents do you have to scan?
Just this one, and all the ones in those boxes.
I gotta get out of here pronto.
Time to get those old ladies to do my work for me.
How?
By shining down on them with the Haverford charm ray.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Ethel Beavers.
What's up, beautiful?
Julianne Moore just called.
She wants her hair back.
Nobody named Julien called.
Never mind.
I just need to ask you a couple of questions.
One, can you help me out with this project we're doing?
And, two, will you please invite me to your 30th birthday party?
What are you doing?
I'm making a test call to your phone to make sure it's working so you don't miss any more calls.
You know what?
Don't bother.
Maybe I'll just find an open window and plummet to my death.
Okay.
This isn't gonna work.
Okay, you did not just swivel away while I was talking to you.
This spaceship keyboard is driving me crazy.
I'm down to one word a minute, and the word is "perflipisklup" because I can't fly spaceships.
Donna, you know as well as I do these city manager shakeups always peter out.
You just have to wait.
Usually I'm with you.
But this is Chris Traeger, the six million dollar man.
He won't quit.
So you need to swivel your ass down to his office and have a word with him.
Mommy.
Oh!
That is so thoughtful of you.
Of course!
I just figured, hey, why not put my mother in a good mood?
So, it's my understanding that despite what I said in our meeting, you have somehow increased your request for more school buses.
Excuse me, but I'm having coffee with my daughter.
Maybe we could do this another time.
No, we're gonna talk about this now.
Or if you'd prefer, I could put a permanent freeze on the education budget.
It's your call.
Wow, maybe you should talk to him, Mom.
He seems pretty self-assured.
There's nothing left.
It's over.
Hey, hey, hey, don't say that.
Now, come on.
Get yourself together and go out there and be the woman you always knew you could be.
Thank you so much.
Who was that?
I don't know.
I saw her crying, and so I helped.
What did you wanna talk to me about?
Look, Chris, I'm very flattered you thought of me for this amazing opportunity, but I don't really know if this gig is in my wheelhouse.
I tend to work best with young, attractive people.
Tom, I have made you a project leader.
This is a big deal!
You should keep an open mind.
Let your brain unlock the door to your heart's future.
I made that expression up when I was 14.
Still in use today.
By me.
Gotta jam.
You know what?
It's just not possible.
And don't even bother trying to outflank me either, because you will fail.
Where did all this confidence come from all of a sudden?
Hey, guys, come on.
Let's relax.
You know, Ms. Griggs-Knope Marlene.
There's probably a compromise here.
Compromise is usually a sign of weakness.
Yes, it is, according to Andrew Carnegie.
But your demands remind me of a different quote, from the great Bill Watterson.
"You need a lobotomy.
I'll get a saw".
I love Calvin and Hobbes.
Me, too!
I gotta say, this is some of my best work.
This could not have gone better.
They are really hitting it off.
Thank God.
Crisis averted.
Well, I am very glad you came back up here.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah So you have a deal.
Well, let me mull everything over, and then we can reconnect and hash things out.
It might get rough, but that can be fun.
Ben can handle it.
Yep, I can.
Okay, great.
It was a pleasure.
Oh!
Mmm-hmm.
What's so great is, she was impressed by you, too.
I mean, you could tell instantly.
The way you guys were connecting was really amazing.
Now, what I'm thinking is that maybe we should go over to her house You two are just the cutest things on four legs!
But why so much black?
It's like you're going to a funeral.
She's got a point, babe.
So, marry her then.
I wish!
Hey, sorry to interrupt the love fest, but can you hand me that folder there, please, Ethel?
Oh, great.
Why you gotta be like that, Ethel?
Looks like someone got up on the wrong side of the crib.
Stop laughing, Muriel.
Stop it!
I gotta say, I'm a genius.
The only thing my mom loves more than music boxes is McSteamy from Grey's Anatomy.
So, I made her a McSteamy-style music box, and I thought maybe you could give it to her.
She would love you for it.
I think maybe that's not such a good idea.
Why?
I mean, it's not the best picture of him, but Your mom kind of, um, made a pass at me.
So, Webster's dictionary describes a pork as a No, it's park Park.
I'm sorry.
Geez, okay.
So You know what, can we start over?
Let's Let's go from the first thing.
I said, pork, which By the way, they have a great pork sandwich in the cafeteria today.
Ron Swanson.
Chris.
You have come up with a plan so spectacularly horrible that it might ruin the entire department.
Now, wait a minute.
I mean that as a compliment.
So, it pains me to say this.
My department has to go back to the way it was.
Give them time.
They'll adjust.
No, they won't.
They're miserable.
Tom only performs when there's someone to impress, so marooning him on Freak Island isn't helping anyone.
And you made April assistant to everyone?
You know who April hates?
Everyone.
And Jerry can only function if no one's looking.
You shine a light on him, and he shrinks up faster than an Eskimo's scrotum.
Well, that's very perceptive, Ron.
And, very graphic.
I understand your point, but there's no way that I can just roll over on this.
Okay.
You won't ever hear me say this again, so savor this moment.
I may have a compromise.
Look, she was just flirting a little.
I'm sure she's not really interested in me.
Oh, my God.
I can't even have this conversation.
The whole thing is screwed up now.
There's so many ways to destroy a bubble, but my mom flirting with you is number one on the list.
And I'm sorry, I have to say this, were you asking for it in any way?
No!
How were you dressed?
Oh, my God.
I was wearing this.
Here's what we do.
You issue a government-wide memo about sexual harassment, and then you go to Mexico.
Just for a couple of weeks.
Where are you going?
Ben!
Ben!
Wait.
Just Hey Hi, Mom.
Hi again.
Leslie and I are dating.
We haven't told anyone because there's a rule against office relationships.
But it's happening.
I'm sorry we didn't tell you before you touched my knee, and I trust you won't tell anyone now since it could get your daughter fired.
That is hilarious.
That's what we thought, too.
Well Four buses.
Two.
Deal.
I like this one.
Me, too.
You keep your hands off him.
Margaret's pecan squares.
They are like crack.
I brought you one.
How are you so happy working here?
I don't know, man.
It's not that bad.
A year ago, I lived in a pit.
Now I got a job, and a kickass wife.
And my band is so good, and are you gonna eat that pecan square?
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
I read that once on a can of lemonade.
But I like to think that it applies to life.
I don't want lemonade.
It's too sweet and it makes my tongue feel gritty.
So maybe it's time for a change.
Starting now, when life gives me lemons, I'm gonna slice them up into wedges and throw them into vodka tonics, which I will then sip in a burlesque nightclub that I co-own with actor Taye Diggs and two of the Pussycat Dolls.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Kind of figured you'd be back in your office by now.
Well, you know how new city managers are.
Seems like everyone else is back to normal.
How long do you have to do this?
A week.
Citizen request.
Swivel, swivel, swivel.
Hello.
I can help you in here, sir.
Oh, man, you're really screwing this up.
I'm gone for one day and this entire shoe shine stand falls apart.
Everything I built.
Jump up here.
I'll show you how it's done.
See, your problem is you're thinking too much.
Wow.
You're really good at this.
Yes.
I am.
When I come back here in a few weeks, I don't want all my regular customers to not be here waiting for me because somebody screwed it up.
Huh?
Thanks.
No problem.
See you later, kid.
Wow.
What a moron.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
I have some very important news about our favorite mini-horse, Li'I Sebastian.
Yay!
Li'I Sebastian!
He died last night.
No.
But we can take comfort in the fact that he is in heaven now, doing the two things he loves doing the most.
Eating carrots and urinating freely.
When I walked in this morning and saw the flag was at half-mast, I thought, " All right.
"Another bureaucrat ate it".
But then I found out it was Li'I Sebastian.
Half-mast is too high.
Show some damned respect.
Because of all he's done for the town, we are gonna be holding a small memorial service for him.
But for now, I think we should bow our heads in a moment of silence.
I got it, thank you.
So maintenance is gonna set up the stage.
Ron will be laying the ceremonial wreath.
Leslie, there's a 13th century Italian poem by Dante Alighieri that would be very appropriate.
Oh, Jerry, that sounds wonderful.
Okay, Andy, I need you to write a memorial song.
Something like Candle in the Wind, but 5,000 times better.
Easy.
Hey, if you want a song from Andy Dwyer, lead singer of Mouse Rat, you should know he doesn't get out of bed for less than $1,000.
We can give him 50 bucks.
Sold.
Okay, here is a memo with some facts about Li'I Sebastian.
I think you'll find yours particularly interesting.
It's just a list of facts.
What?
Okay, mine says, "You have a cute butt".
That's weird.
Must be a typo.
Yeah, Jerry, it's probably a typo, because it probably should've said, "You have a cube butt".
'Cause your butt's shaped like a cube.
Yeah.
The question is, why is my memo different than everyone else's?
Cube butt, cube butt.
Cube butt, cube butt.
Well, the good news is this is just tendonitis.
How is that good news?
The other option was shoulder cancer.
Really?
No.
Look, you exercise a lot.
You're in great shape.
Little things like this happen with men of your age.
Men of my age?
How old do you think I am?
Forty-two.
I am 44, and I plan to live to be 150.
Okay.
So.
What's the cure?
Get a time machine.
Go back to being 20.
Dr. Harris, you are literally the meanest person I have ever met.
Okay, all the permits cleared for the horse funeral.
What was that tone?
What?
Oh, nothing.
Question!
Who's a genius?
Answer, Tom Haverford.
Reason, Jean-Ralphio just started an exclusive, high-end production company, and he's willing to put on Li'I Sebastian's memorial service pro bono, just for the pub.
Pub is an abbreviation for publicity.
Jean-Ralphio is a clown.
This is the memorial for Li'I Sebastian, not double-coupon night at a strip club.
First off, double-coupon night is an incredible value.
Secondly, this guy just started a business.
He's my friend.
It would really help him out.
Plus, I'm gonna oversee everything and make sure it goes great.
Okay, Tom, we trust you.
Make us proud.
Make him proud.
Why don't you just Photoshop that out?
Oh, hi, Ann Perkins.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm dying.
What?
Tendonitis.
Oh.
I don't know if you should lead with "I'm dying".
You're right, you're right.
So.
What's up with you?
I'm just helping Leslie plan Li'I Sebastian's memorial service.
Li'I Sebastian died?
He was old, and he had a lot of ailments.
Like tendonitis?
I don't know.
I don't have his chart in front of me.
Could you get it?
What?
No There's no chart.
Oh, my God.
Death is inescapable.
Goodbye, Ann Perkins.
Man, whenever I run into that guy, he always just throws me off.
Don't even talk about Chris.
Every time I hear his name, I think about the fact that he's gonna find out about me and Ben, and he's gonna fire both of us.
And about how much he hurt you.
Yeah, there you go.
Yeah.
Okay, I'm gonna see Ben in our secret meeting place in a few minutes.
How do I look?
What are you going for?
Sophisticated with a hint of slutty.
Bulls-eye.
So nice to see you so happy about a guy.
Thanks.
I don't know.
When I look at my life right now, it feels almost perfect.
I mean, we have to sneak around, but weirdly, it's kind of fun that nobody knows.
Hello, Leslie.
How long have you been sleeping with Ben?
What?
How long have you been sleeping with Ben?
That's disgusting and wrong.
I don't even get Why would I I've never had sex with anyone anywhere.
It's none of your You have the nerve, the audacity Ben is my boss, technically.
And he is terrible, facewise.
And how How do I know, frankly, that you're not sleeping with him?
Maybe you are.
Maybe you're trying to throw me off.
Hmm.
Check and mate.
This is an outrage!
Who do I call?
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey, Ron.
Listen, you're just who I was looking for.
Are you Did you forget the Did you Can I get that thing?
Can we just, uh Did you bring it?
This isn't convincing.
How did you find out?
We've worked together for a while now.
I'd like to think I know you pretty well.
Plus, Ben butt-dialed me last night.
Okay, okay.
And this is how Eleanor Roosevelt would kiss.
Whoa.
Eleanor likes the tongue.
Hey, show me Pelosi again.
Okay, lay down.
Please tell me you hung up before Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Unfortunately not.
This is a scandal waiting to happen.
If you get caught, which you clearly will, Chris will fire you.
And I won't be able to stop him.
Come on, help me.
There's a lot riding on this.
This is what Li'I Sebastian's gonna listen to in horsey heaven.
Okay, let me hear your favorite one so far.
You're a champion little horse And you're dead You're the champion of death You're the champion of death Maybe try to do one without the word "dead" so much.
Or "death" or "you're dead".
See?
You're helping me already.
So the only people that know are my mom, Ann, and Ron.
And they're not gonna say anything.
Right.
Just no more fooling around at work.
Okay, yeah.
We can't.
Well, I mean, you know, a situation could arise where you do something good, and I congratulate you.
You know, kind of like this.
Yes.
Like, "Oh, congratulations".
That feels appropriate.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I think we can get away with that as long as we don't do stuff like this.
Hey, lovebirds.
What do I do with this?
You can just leave it there.
- Okay.
So my mom, Ron, Ann, and that guy.
For the memorial ribbons?
No doubt.
Which one floats your penis?
They're all black.
Maybe to the layman, Jerry.
Obsidian, onyx, midnight, lost soul, rolling blackout, sleeping panther, and void by Armani.
Hey, Jerry, does this look black to you, too?
What you saw was not what you think it is.
I was just congratulating her because she got some good news.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
We were both kind of up for this thing, this really I won the MacArthur Genius Grant.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, so that's what the hug was all about.
Sure.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Hey, you know what?
We'll cover your duties here.
You should just take the rest of the day off.
Okay.
Well, thanks.
Thank you.
And thank you for your discretion.
You got it.
Welcome, everyone.
Sebastian may have been li'I, but his impact on this town and the Parks Department was anything but li'I.
I would like to introduce two of his closest friends.
Cue music and lights, and Go Ladybug, go Coconut.
Coconut and Ladybug both in position.
Not only was Coconut a friend, but she was also a lover.
Our deepest sympathy is with you.
Coconut just took a dump on the stage.
We gotta clean that up.
Code red.
Coconut just took a dump onstage.
Hey, Leslie.
The maintenance guy bailed on us.
No one knows where he is.
He had the fuel for the eternal flame.
No way.
That guy left?
What a Okay.
Start the video presentation.
I'll deal with it.
All right.
Jerry, I need you to go get some propane.
No, what about my poem?
No one wants you to read a poem, okay, Jerry?
What everyone wants, what Li'I Sebastian wants, is for you to get propane.
Fine.
I'll do it for Li'I Sebastian.
Now we have a special presentation, courtesy of the folks at Entertainment 7Twenty.
Hope you brought a change of clothes.
'Cause your eyes are about to piss tears.
You nasty.
Who are we?
Where are we going in life?
What is the meaning of all of this?
These are questions Li'I Sebastian never had to answer because he was a horse.
Instead, he just brought us joy and happiness.
And isn't that the point?
You gotta join the company.
I'm the bank.
You're the money.
I know, J, but it'd be a big leap.
And I will take that leap with you.
I'm Thelma, you're Louise.
You can't die full of regret.
Why don't you live your life like that cow from the video?
He was a horse.
Yeah.
Because he followed his dreams.
There was no obstacle too large.
No mountain too high.
No valley too low.
Li'I Sebastian had a long life, filled with wonder.
Good night, Li'I Sebastian.
Forever.
We'd like to encourage everyone to buy our merchandise.
All the proceeds will go towards Li'I Sebastian's favorite charity, the Afghan Institute of Learning.
Next, we have a special musical tribute by Mr. Andy Dwyer.
What's 5,000 times better than a candle in the wind?
This song is called 5,000 Candles in the Wind.
Up in horsey heaven Here's the thing You trade your legs for angel's wings And once we've all said goodbye You take a running leap and you learn to fly Bye-bye, Li'I Sebastian I miss you in the saddest fashion Bye-bye, Li'I Sebastian You're 5,000 candles in the wind Hey, why is Perd Hapley unveiling the memorial stone?
Because Joe from sewage had to hand out the armbands, and Perd had to fill in for Mortenson, and Mortenson had to fill in for Howser.
Okay, well, why couldn't Donna do it?
Because Donna's reading Jerry's Italian poem.
This is sort of a mess.
No, it's okay, we're What the hell, Leslie?
I thought I was supposed to lay the ceremonial wreath.
Why is Councilman Howser doing it?
Because you are doing something better.
You are lighting the memorial flame, which is the greatest honor of all.
Oh, my God.
Ron, congratulations.
I saved it for you, Ron.
Who caught you guys?
A very nosy maintenance worker, and we talked to him, and now we're all friends, and he's not gonna tell on us.
It's totally fine.
I think if you would know one thing about me, it would be that I prefer laying wreaths to lighting torches.
I have cried twice in my life.
Once when I was seven, and I was hit by a school bus.
And then again when I heard that Li'I Sebastian had passed.
His memory will live on, as today we light a fire that will burn on for eternity.
Okay, deep breath.
I think we got through it.
Thank God.
Yeah.
Hey, Jerry, you put propane in the eternal flame, right?
No, they were out.
So I just got a big thing of lighter fluid.
It's kind of the same thing.
Huh?
Oh!
We planned that!
Wow, wow!
We planned that.
Yay!
Please, Ron, I am very sorry.
I guess I put too much fuel in the torch.
Oh, I don't know, Jerry.
I think you're being hard on yourself.
Ron, are you mad at me?
'Cause without eyebrows, I can't really tell.
Ron Swanson loves his facial hair.
And we burned it off.
This thing that we're doing, it's unsustainable.
What, you want to break up?
What?
No.
I like you.
Well, then You want to tell Chris.
What?
No.
I like my job.
Well, then, what do we do?
Okay, operation shutdown.
No more secret hand-holding.
No more smooching in Ann's office.
In fact, when we're at work, we just shouldn't talk to each other at all.
Okay, well, that's gonna be really hard, and we could still get fired.
I know.
But it's worth the risk if I can be with you.
All right.
Well, then, I'm in.
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?
I'm sorry.
No, it's force of habit.
So what do I do, Ron?
Do I stay here or roll the dice with Jean-Ralphio?
You have no interest in government work, and you slow everything down with your selfish attitude.
I'd love for you to stick around, Tommy.
It'll be damn hard to replace you.
But I'll support you either way.
Two of my lovers in one place.
What a coincidence.
Tammy.
Hello, Ron.
Ooh, what happened here?
And more importantly, does the carpet match the face?
If you're looking for trouble, take it somewhere else.
An hour ago, a giant fireball consumed my entire face.
And it was far preferable to spending another second with you.
Tell that to your pants-tent.
It's just the way I'm standing.
Go back to the library, where you belong.
Hey, Glenn.
Wanna dance?
No, I'm okay.
Just one dance?
No.
With mommy?
You know, tendonitis is usually caused by overuse.
Have you been working out more than usual?
I did do 10,000 push-ups last week.
Oh, really.
That might have something to do with it.
You need to relax.
You're in great shape.
For a 44-year-old.
Yeah.
That's how old you are, man.
You're right.
I've been overreacting.
I don't like thinking about death.
Death is the opposite of Being alive?
Exactly.
Look at us.
Talking like friends.
Yeah.
What the hell.
Friends.
Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger.
What's the point in doing 10,000 push-ups if you're gonna do them alone?
I'd much rather do 5,000 push-ups with a wonderful woman.
Sitting on my back to increase my resistance.
Copy of our new hit single, 5,000 Candles in the Wind, and the new full-length CD, The Awesome Album.
Eighteen bucks each, $40 for the set.
I don't know.
That's a lot of money.
No, it isn't.
Okay.
Honey, you are awesome at this.
Thanks.
April, I need to ask you something, and it's the biggest thing I've ever asked anybody in my entire life.
Honey, we're already married.
No, this is way more important than that.
April Ludgate, would you be my manager?
Seriously?
Okay.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Are you Leslie Knope?
Yes.
My name is William Barnes.
Do you have a minute to talk?
Sure.
We really enjoyed the service.
That fireball was truly amazing.
I'm glad.
'Cause it was planned.
And you were also responsible for the Harvest Festival, correct?
Well, a lot of people contributed to that.
You don't have to be modest.
We know it was you.
You did an amazing job.
Thank you.
We are part of a group that tries to identify potential candidates for political office here in town.
And we think that you might fit the bill.
Oh.
Wow.
Which office in particular?
Well, there are a couple city council seats we think are vulnerable.
And the mayor's term is up next year.
All we need to know right now is are you theoretically interested in running for office?
Absotootly, I am.
Very sorry that I just used that word.
But yes.
I just I've dreamed about this moment for a long time.
Guess I'll be heading home.
Catching the number 12 bus to Satan's butthole?
Actually, I prefer the number 69 train to Humpsville station.
Red alert, Swanson.
Your ex-wife is back.
No kidding, Donna.
Not her.
The other ex-wife.
Tammy One.
She's in your office.
Would I have to quit my job?
Well, that's a long way off.
Of course.
But listen.
When you run, even in a local election, your life becomes an open book.
So if you so much as stiff a waiter on his tip or use a government stamp for personal mail, it will come out.
So before we go any further, I need you to tell me, is there a scandal out there?
Is there anything at all you need to tell us about your life?
Nope.
All right.
Well, we'll be in touch.
Yeah, I think we can do that for a million.
Okay, we'll talk soon.
There was no one on the other end of that phone call, but soon there will be.
Welcome to the Dreamatorium, A.K.A. the headquarters of Entertainment 7Twenty.
We got a pool table, a ping-pong table, a couch with a ceiling on it, in-house DJ.
DJ Blunt.
And best of all, former NBA superstar Detlef Schrempf is on retainer.
What's up, Detlef?
So, Tom, what does this business do, again?
It's a multimedia entertainment production conglomerate.
I don't know, man.
You have a lot of overhead here.
Ever thought about scaling back a bit and focusing on building your client base?
Thanks a lot, Forbes magazine.
But we didn't hire you to give us business advice.
We hired you to look pretty and shoot baskets.
So why don't you head over there and do your thing?
We want people to see you when they come in, Detlef.
Big D, hit me!
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Come on.
We're living the dream.
