{START OF EPISODE 1}
Welcome back to Greendale, now ranking fifth on Colorado's alphabetical listing of community colleges.
Rest in peace, Fatboy Slim's DJ School.
This school owes its continued existence to the following heroes: Jeff Winger, a teacher so dedicated to clean energy he's already parking like his car is electric.
Britta Perry, currently raising awareness of homelessness not that she has a choice.
Abed Nadir, who actually wrote this announcement for the sake of, as he put it, catching everyone up.
And Annie Edison who led the effort to save Greendale from 534 critical emergencies.
Five hundred thirty-four?
Frisbee!
Hey, Leonard, what, are you gonna bogart the disc all day?
Like tears in rain.
What?
I can't believe the roof collapsed.
- We almost killed Fat Neil.
- That was Garrett.
See, we're monsters.
If they blame us, let me take the heat.
I'd never see the inside of a cell.
I have been reliving this day over and over for a thousand years.
Guys, this is not on us.
That roof was gonna collapse; Speaking of guilt, where's Shirley?
- You didn't tell him?
- I was waiting until we were all together.
Abed's not comfortable with C-H-A-N-G-E.
Hey, screw you.
I can spell.
Screw you.
- Is Shirley gone?
Did she spin off?
- Nobody spins off in real life, Abed.
Shirley went to look after her dad in Atlanta and ended up taking a job as a personal chef to a brilliant but troubled detective.
I told her I'd manage her shop while she's gone.
That's very generous of you.
I have a friend in town, every time you need help.
She'll be back.
Like Troy?
Are any of you white people noticing what's happening to this group?
Do Abed and I need to be concerned?
You have my word, as leader of the white people, no cause for alarm.
Say hello to new Shirley.
Heh, heh.
Just kidding.
This is Francesca Dart.
I have brought her on as an administrative consultant.
I thought it would be fun and mandatory for you to add her to your little committee.
- Why, because one roof collapsed?
- No.
God, God no.
I'm your friend bringing you a new friend one with training in not collapsing roofs.
Is she?
Excuse me, ma'am.
Is she above us or below us?
She is Whoop.
Heh, heh, heh.
I'm getting a call here and, um, I'll have to take it.
Why don't you explain what your role will be while I leave to take this call.
- My phone is vibrating, but it is - In your office which you didn't realize when you started the fake phone call move.
- My phone is in my pocket, Jeffrey.
- Hm.
I'm walking away, so I can get it out and answer it.
Let me know how it goes.
- Okay, I'll just have a seat - No!
- Hey!
- No!
Our friend used to sit there.
She spun off.
I'm sorry.
What about here?
- Yeah.
- I guess that's okay.
Okay, so I took an informal survey to get a sense of how Greendale is perceived.
Weird, passionate and gross.
Now, you wanna hang on to that grouping.
In marketing, it's what we call the Good Belushi.
If I had a magic wand, I'd use it to make sure Greendale never had to grow up.
I would also probably use it to cut the magic-wand class that I noticed is actually offered here, as well as VCR repair a class called Ladders, and "When Is It Okay to Shake a Baby"?
In terms of hierarchy, I'm a big believer in it.
Someone needs to say, "I'm in charge," and that person is me.
That's my decision.
That doesn't mean that we don't work together but all communication and decisions will go through me.
I'll send out an e-mail later to set up our next meeting.
- Awesome.
- Great seeing you.
Yeah.
Coolios.
Who in the crazy bitch?
- Did that just happen?
- Did you see her binder?
Ha.
Ha!
- Nondescript.
- Seems like she may be trouble.
To be fair, she's an additional "white" person - which has become important here.
- No, thank you.
I'm I'm just glad I was able to answer.
My My phone got lodged in my pocket.
I know.
I I guess that is a thing.
So you were saying about the thing, the reason you were calling was What were you talking to me about?
Looks good, Tony.
I'm sorry, I just assume your name is Tony.
Here you go.
I gave you some extra heat.
Britta, what is the weekly cost of this restaurant?
That's easy.
My dignity.
Seems like this sandwich counter is consuming your happiness and converting it into burnt bread and debt.
- So?
- Frankie, hi.
Um Someone removed all the liquor from the faculty lounge.
I'm sorry, I can't legally protect or insure a campus with free-flowing booze.
Well, I can't teach with free-flowing sobriety.
- Heh.
- Is that true?
- Do you really think you're an addict?
- No.
Dean.
Hello?
Oh, hey.
Yes, I can talk.
- Damn it.
- I am available anytime for you.
Frankie, Frankie.
Hi.
I had an idea about how to de-electrify the pool.
- Oh, that's already been dealt with.
- Okay, well, then there's Oh, let's see.
Done, done, deloused appraised, defused, rebuilt de-peanut buttered, debunked, spayed, neutered underway, re-sanctified, plunged, deported and exhumed.
Thank you.
Oh, this is pretty.
I'm gonna name one of my sandwiches after her.
- My sandwiches suck.
- She is improving Greendale.
Yeah, but how much can you improve Greendale before it stops being Greendale?
She didn't suffer for this place.
She doesn't understand it.
She's gonna end up messing with something that Abed.
Temporal mutation.
In English, doc.
Simply put, Mr. President in 12 hours, these dinosaurs will become Mind if I sit here?
- Time-osaurs.
Go ahead, I can re-shoot.
- How's everything going?
- I have concerns.
- I'd like to hear them.
- You're not distinct from Annie in physicality and purpose.
- Okay.
I can't determine if you have any point of view that makes you a creative addition.
I don't know what that means, but I'm writing it down.
My umbrella concern is that you represent the end of "our show" which was once a family of misfit students and is now a loose-knit students and teachers none of whom are take class together in school, which is becoming grounded asking questions like, "How do any of us get our money?
When will we get our degrees?
What happened to that girl I was dating"?
As opposed to questions like, "What is real?
What is sanity?
Is there a god?
Where's that Pierce hologram"?
Jeff saw a Pierce hologram.
None of us have seen it.
If there's a Pierce ghost, I'd like to get a head start on busting it.
All right.
This is the first I've heard that I'm a character on a show.
I'm excited to be one, but I'll be a boring one.
Quirks are not my strong suit, results are.
I love quirky people.
I come from a big family of people who are literally insane.
I moved out here to take care of one.
But I myself am exceptionally boring, and I am quite proud to be that way because it allows me to help the less boring people turn quirks into results.
That's the most interesting take on not being interesting I've ever heard.
As far as what I represent, I wouldn't give me or anyone else that power.
Good shows change, I assume.
Personally, I don't own a TV.
You're the first person to say that that I didn't delete from my brain.
Thank you.
Emergency meeting at Shirley's Sandwiches right now.
Everyone freaking out.
New lady is evil.
- Crazy frown.
- I should go.
Abed, I could use someone's help in learning the ropes around here.
I'll ask around.
- Brit, dumb hat.
- Talking down to you.
- She hates you.
- I got it from Shirley.
What are you doing?
Are you The Big Chill- ing?
Only there's not a hippie that died to make us come together and complain.
- It's our school.
- Frankie's taking over.
Cancelled Ladders, she's banning substances.
She wants to shut down Shirley's Sandwiches.
She called Annie a bitch.
- She implied I was a bitch.
- Implied Annie was a bitch who thinks she's better.
- You're just She was nice to me.
In fact, we got along.
Abed, are you sure she wasn't actually being sweetly condescending?
I learned to pick up on that.
I make a movement that we form a separate, secret committee.
I second Britta's motion, not movement.
I third Annie's number two-ing of the movement Brita made.
- Gross.
To preserve the real Greendale, oppose Frankie or drink.
Whatever's easiest.
Are you guys sure she's bad?
Sure you're not doing what I do, overreacting to change?
Nobody's ever doing what you do, Abed.
You're nuts.
In a good way.
I'm just saying.
Leave reality to us.
- We support you.
- Don't make it more dramatic.
It's a blood oath to defy evil.
You're either in or out.
- Can I hang around if I don't do the oath?
- Oh, gee.
You mean just be friends?
Sure.
Great, Abed.
Okay.
Can I have some pretzels?
No.
Those are secret-committee pretzels.
Okay.
Well Yes, that was a test.
You guys are bad friends.
Don't think of it as bad baking.
Think of it as a crushing blow to a gender stereotype.
Ugh.
Might help if every burnt sandwich didn't come with a self-aware sandwich bit.
Is that how you're gonna help increase sales, creative notes?
I had that sign spinner idea.
We're a restaurant inside a cafeteria, Annie, our weak point wasn't traffic.
Flo, Alice, stop fighting, can't afford to lose this place.
If I start drinking in the men's room the score in my head has to change from Trent Reznor to Johnny Cash doing Trent Reznor.
- I'm a bartender.
I know a little bit more about the human side of service.
I can't eat this.
Can I get my money back?
You're human garbage.
- Hi, Mr. Winger.
Nice lecture yesterday.
- Don't patronize me, Dave.
It might not seem like this, but you're killing a black-owned business.
I'll call it even for a drink with Mr. Winger.
- That's absurd.
- You will?
Let's see some ID.
You snitch, you die.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Morning.
Well, I guess we'll wait for the others before we start.
- I don't think they're coming.
- What?
The committee had a meeting last night and decided you are evil.
Ooh.
Wait, you guys had a meeting last night?
So we broke up as friends.
Because I don't think you're evil.
I think you scare people because you live in the real world.
I'm sorry that happened, Abed.
It's like I said yesterday at lunch.
Drama and conflict are exciting and easy.
Making a difference can be pretty boring.
You guys had lunch?
I'd live in that world.
I'm tired from all the drama - the heroes, the villains, monsters - PokÃ©mons.
You see things the way they are.
Leprechauns Scary.
I don't know if I could be like that, but I don't think it makes sense to be against it.
- Ever hear of the Slender Man?
I'd like to help and if possible, learn from you.
You guys on Reddit?
4chan?
- That would be great.
- It's awesome.
I think we'd all benefit if we were more like you.
- So, what do you say?
- Let's order some food.
- Let's save Greendale.
- Let's save Greendale.
Tacos!
We are something else.
Abed.
- Abed.
- Yeah?
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?
You were sweeping, straightening clocks Why are you cleaning that sign?
I gave you a list.
List felt similar visually.
I can't picture a montage cutting from me "verifying Diane's invoice" to me "e-mailing confirmation to Diane".
- Right.
But a montage is what, Abed?
- It's a movie apologizing for reality.
- And we are where?
- Reality.
And what do people do here?
They e-mail Diane.
Abed, if you change your clothes one more time today, you're fired.
Sorry.
- Hey, Abed.
- Hey, Todd.
Are Annie and Britta around?
No.
Abed.
Maybe you should order the special.
I'll have the special.
The specials are kept in the back.
You sh You should go in the back.
I'd like the special.
Vaporizers?
Skittles?
- Abed.
- Hey, Annie.
This place is so conceptual.
It's practical too.
We made enough money to save Shirley's.
Ironic because if Shirley saw this, her soul would die.
Hey, Abed, check this out.
- Oh, Britta's still the worst?
- A bar gets dirty.
You'll need someone to clean it.
Probably after hours.
And those floor polishers can get pretty loud.
I'd hate for someone to hear it.
You blackmailing me?
Just talking shop.
What's the rumpus, Abed?
- Miller's Crossing.
Mm-hm.
This is great.
You guys should be proud of yourselves.
We missed you.
Have a drink.
- Put on an old-timey jacket.
- That's okay.
I don't do this anymore.
All right.
Come on.
I said, I don't do this, see?
- You dirty rat.
- You guys are all dirty rats.
- What's your romper room?
- All right.
Maybe just one drink.
And then, maybe, cut to a montage of drinks.
Whoo!
- Go, go, go!
- Shots, shots, shots!
Drinking!
Let's never stop being friends again.
Ever.
Mm-hm.
Cheers.
We shouldn't have made you choose between Frankie and us.
Oh, she's good for business.
- Sorry we made you choose - You're just repeating what I said.
You're repeating what I said.
- Oh, I'm a time traveler?
- This is a show!
Abed.
I just got word from Diane that one of your e-mails was a little shaky.
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.
Late night last night.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I could use a little protein.
I'm gonna go get an early lunch.
You guys know about tardigrades?
They're microscopic creatures that look like robot bears.
They can survive in space.
Get into space, you dirty tardigrades, see?
And they're everywhere.
There's things in real life that are as cool as fake stuff.
I learned that working for Frankie.
You guys would like her, you know.
- Raid!
- Ah!
Is this what you guys want?
You wanna play cops and robbers with costumes?
- Why is that guy a carrot?
- Because they ran out.
- Who tattled?
- In what world, Britta do you see this as covert enough to require tattling?
You built a bar in a school.
There was lumber involved.
I have been letting you hole up down here because it kept you contained and satisfied.
Because you are all compulsively defiant.
But it wasn't enough.
You had to drag Abed back in.
And Abed deserves better.
- Oh.
Oh, ho-ho-ho.
It finally comes out.
Abed deserves better.
That's been out.
Shut up, Leonard.
I once mistook six people for you in a pharmacy.
It's not their fault, Frankie.
I chose this.
These are my friends.
I hate e-mailing Diane.
It's pathological.
And so am I. This is where I belong.
I know you think that, Abed, but you don't know any better.
- Oops.
- Uh Uh Shut up, Leonard.
You are You are old and you deserve less because of your age.
I don't believe that.
I'm just trying to I'm trying to And everybody here is a fart!
A living fart from the butt of a lesser god!
And I'm I'm better than this.
Cut to everyone-on-campus- getting-as-drunk-as-they-want montage.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Ah!
Jeffrey?
Frankie hasn't come back to work today.
That's terrible.
Insurance company dropped us.
The school has no insurance.
- What was Frankie's salary?
- A lot.
- Insurance premiums?
- A lot.
Add those together.
That's your school dance budget.
Oh, nice.
Welcome to Ladders!
Yeah!
Ladders!
Who wants to see the Ladders professor go higher?
- Ladders!
- Whoa, whoa.
Ah!
You did it, Jeff Winger.
This is your school now.
- Annie.
- It was worth it.
Ah!
All right.
That should be the extent of the professor's medical bills.
What about the lawsuits from the students?
I think we should fight those.
Actually, I suggest you settle out of court.
- This is my fault.
- Obviously not.
It's my fault.
- Guys, it's my fault.
- It's my fault.
- It's my fault.
- It's my fault.
- It's my fault.
- My fault.
- It's my fault.
- It's my fault.
- It's my fault.
- It's my fault.
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
All right, all right, all right!
So whose fault wasn't it and who knows anything about handling anything like this?
In terms of hierarchy, I'm a big believer in it.
Someone needs to say, "I'm in charge," and that person is me.
That's my decision.
Wait.
What?
- I'm sorry?
- Who talks like that?
Why would anyone hire someone so pompous?
Miss Dart, word of advice.
Change your personality or start looking for companies run by insane people.
Don't hire this woman!
Fifth time's the charm.
He's barged into four offices screaming.
- What the hell is going on?
- What are you doing here?
- How did you even find me?
- I e-mailed Diane.
She knows too much about your schedule.
Whatever he's offering you, Greendale Well, we can't double it.
We probably can't even match it.
Whatever he's offering you, Greendale will give you less and an apology.
- Do you know?
- Shh.
It's not enough.
But maybe if you added more apologies Like a montage of them?
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.
We're sorry.
We're sorry.
We're - Sorry.
- A flyer.
- Thanks.
Take a look.
Okay, is that clear to everyone?
I told you I wouldn't be needing dinner tonight.
I'm guessing you wouldn't.
Not if you're looking for this.
- How did you know?
- Nobody makes more crumbs than a cook.
Well, the same goes for clues and detectives.
You're too busy solving murders to get away with your own.
Well, what about the case of my wife and my leg, Shirley?
Can you solve that one, huh, can you?
Because if you can't, then I ain't got nothing to live for.
Begging your pardon, Mr. Butcher.
I think the people on this bayou would disagree.
- You rescued a runaway girl today.
- Rescued?
Balls!
I couldn't even rescue a bulb from a socket and you did all the work.
I'm just a detective from the swamps of Atlanta.
Can't even walk!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Oh!
Unh!
Then let me be your legs.
Let me do for you what I did today every week until you find your wife or your legs.
Oh, you are a stubborn son of a bitch, Shirley Bennett.
Now, come on.
I have dinner to make.
You got cases to solve.
I have a feeling someone's gonna murder some Tater Tots tonight.
That's no mystery at all.
Next week on The Butcher and the Baker: When a new detective disappears and Butcher is the prime suspect it's up to Shirley to cook up some answers.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Yahoo!
Chomsky, come here.
Come here, Chomsky.
Abed, I'm really sorry.
I told you cats don't like me.
They consider me a competitor because of my natural stealth and ambivalence.
Oh, did she get high again and forget she doesn't wear contacts?
Before Britta moved her cats into our apartment, she wanted to introduce them to us on neutral ground.
One of them scratched Abed and ran under the couch.
Oh, I'll get it.
Cats love me.
What?
Are you sure?
Mm-hm.
Hello there.
Well, she is.
Is it a he or a she?
He.
Well, he's really got his teeth in my flesh right now.
Okay, he's touching bone.
I'm just waiting for him to finish up.
Not a lot I can do at this point.
This was a pretty big mistake.
Okay.
This is done.
Oh.
See you tomorrow.
I'm pretty embarrassed about this.
Chomsky.
I didn't know Britta was moving in with Annie and Abed.
That's-.
Expository?
Yeah, Britta's fallen on hard times and our apartment is the cheapest game in town.
Abed, it's a little embarrassing when you put it that way.
Britta's a rich genius with super powers and she's gonna live on our sofa for no reason.
Oh, no.
Dinosaurs.
My tax documents.
Facts about Native Americans.
Just kidding.
Guess what I just purchased for the school from a local manufacturer, Greendale's first virtual reality operating system.
.
Did Greendale need a virtual reality system?
Like a hole in the head.
A hole in the head is something that you don't need.
She said through a huge hole in her head.
Didn't VR go out in the 90s?
The last people I saw using it were in the Honeycomb Hideout.
We mock what we don't understand.
We also mock what's silly.
Jeffrey.
Abed, you're more machine than man.
You wanna give me a hand setting up the equipment after lunch?
We're all going to help Britta move into our place today.
Jeffrey?
Britta, something's come up.
I'd love to.
Oh, yeah, yeah, at least you don't have to bust out your usual excuse.
You don't know for sure that I'm not a veteran, and nobody can say for sure that today isn't Veteran's Day.
Hi.
I got bit by a cat.
Chang, we know.
Why are you guys and all these books in the nurse's office?
Dean, where did you get this, and for how much of the school's money?
Relax, my little bean countess.
Don't worry about it.
You pay me to worry about that.
Oh, and how much do I pay you?
That's you.
It was only $5000.
What?
Frankie, jack me up.
I would like to see this company's website.
Can I use your computer?
Sure.
Have fun in the Stone Age while I step into the third dean-mension.
Width?
Read the instructions, analog man.
When entering virtual reality, you should calibrate the system by looking at your own hands, then turning them over and looking at the backs of them with a sense of wonder.
Roger that.
Welcome to the VirtuGood 6500.
Oh.
Initiate calibration.
It's incredible.
I can see all around.
I gotta take a closer look at these structures, they're!
I'm walking!
I am walking.
My God.
.
I know what this is.
I set the time zone.
I set the time zone.
And my phone does that automatically.
I'm gonna see if I can .
And Jesus wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.
Thank you, guys, again, so much.
I know that I already owe you you money but I want you to know that I got a new bartending job with better hours and free corn nuts which I feel like have a small but significant resale value.
I feel like everybody's talking about that haircut I gave Vicki, so-.
Oh, Britta.
Can I- It's okay.
Do I do this too?
Okay.
This is going to be good for all of us, right?
It's like a fresh start.
Oh, did you guys get a new couch?
We got it for you.
It has a pull-out.
You guys.
I wanted a Murphy bed for shenanigans but the cost to shenanigan ratio was too high.
How did you guys afford this?
Don't worry.
We got a good deal.
For pick up, Perry.
Why's my name on here?
Because we got it for you.
And we told the sales guy that.
So.
So he put your friend's name on the delivery slip?
That seems weird, right?
Roommate movie night!
Roommate movie night, yay!
Portuguese Gremlins.
Portuguese Gremlins, ooh.
It's Portugal's answer to Gremlins if Gremlins' question was how can you totally rip us off without spending any money and having watched us maybe twice?
That's what the Portuguese Gremlins say, right?
It's close enough.
.
.
I did it.
It's 2:39.
That was the time when you started setting the time.
It's 20 minutes later now.
The power.
The facility.
Jesus wept.
Stop saying Jesus wept.
Dean, here's something fun you might want to try.
Let's see if we can find the serial number to this system.
Oh, that could be fun.
So go to Settings.
Is Settings the volcano or the cobbler's workshop?
It's a monastery.
.
I feel the power.
Hut.
Hut.
Hut.
Welcome to Settings.
.
Oh.
Your majesty, the filing cabinets.
You're looking for one called purchase info.
Hit, yeah, ah-ha.
These cabinets would never be this easy to climb in real life.
This is the future of scrolling.
My world is officially boundless.
Ha!
I'm here.
Inside that drawer should be a file called serial number.
.
I've got it!
All right.
Now you just have to print that file out.
You can do that by dragging it to the accessories and peripherals castle, and planting it in the printer garden.
.
What's so funny?
I mean, besides everything?
I have no intention of returning this system.
On the contrary, I intend to keep it.
Dear God.
Delete!
One file selected.
Oh.
Hold on.
File sorted.
What?
Oh come on.
Yeah.
Come here you little.
.
File deleted.
Jesus wept!
He deleted the serial number, Jeff, help me out here.
I don't get paid enough for this.
How much do you think you're going to get paid if I have to find five grand in the budget?
You're not the new Annie.
You're the new Abed.
I don't know what that means yet.
So are the gremlins supposed to be the good guys in this version?
The blue ones are.
The green ones are bad and the red ones are kind of like isolationists.
It's a metaphor for World War II.
Ooh.
Umm, I will be right back, I left something in my car.
Oh.
.
Hi, yes, I picked up a sofa from your store, recently.
The last name is Perry.
Mm-hm.
What?
Are you strong or angry?
My parents?
My parents bought that couch?
Explain yourselves!
Well, are we, okay.
They kind of reached out to us on Facebook.
What?
You know I don't talk to them.
Well, yeah.
That's why they talk to us.
They knew you wouldn't let them help you, at least not directly.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
You needed our help, but we needed their help to help you.
That's why we were able to get you such a good deal on the rent.
They're supplementing my rent too?
Mm-hm.
You make them sound like monsters, but they're actually really nice.
.
Well, they are!
My parents are horrible people.
You're being dramatic.
Oh yeah.
That's what people say when they take your soul, and they rip it out of your chest and then shove it in your mouth.
.
I got bit by a cat.
.
I will create more worlds.
And those worlds will have worlds.
They're file folders, stop calling them worlds.
I found an address.
Elroy Patashnik, founder of Virtu Good technologies.
All right.
I'll go see if I can get the school's money back.
You keep White Morpheus inside the Matrix.
Jeff.
Britta.
You look distraught.
You have ten seconds to tell me it's not about stupid politics.
I just found out that Annie and Abed have been cheating on me with my parents.
They've been sabotaging my life from the shadows by paying off my debts and buying me things.
Thank God.
What are you?
Thank God?
The charade can finally end.
Now you know everything you thought you owed us, you can actually just owe to Deb and George.
Deb and George?
You know my parents too?
Since when?
I don't know, since thousands of dollars ago?
I'm bad with dates.
I remember the New Year's glasses having zeros for eyes.
And when did Stella get her groove back?
You've all been lying to me for years.
What kind of friends are you?
Poor.
We're poor friends.
And you mooch off us because you're too proud to use your own support system.
What kind of friend are you?
And having met them, what were you rebelling against?
Was it generosity, whimsical game nights, or delicious lobster bacon mashed potatoes?
You ate the potatoes?
You, you don't even eat carbs.
I eat love, Britta.
Hot, delicious love that you were willing to wipe your ass with.
Oh, my God.
I have no friends.
Can we not be so dramatic about this?
There are people in this world with serious problems.
Chang, go see the nurse!
I'm trying.
Yeah?
Elroy Patashnik?
Who's asking?
Well, that's always a yes.
Nobody ever says, who's asking, to the wrong name.
They just say, that's not my name.
When my phone rings and I say hello, and they say, is Pablo there?
I don't say, who's asking, I say, wrong number.
You're a clever young man.
I'm 40.
Come in.
So?
You sold a Virtu Good 6500 to Craig Pelton at Greendale Community College, and we need to return it.
I'll need the serial number.
He deleted the serial number because he loves the system.
So what's the problem?
The problem is in order to copy a file, you have to throw a fireball at it, then absorb the fire, then drop the flaming file into a crystal lake, then take out both copies and throw them into the side of a mountain.
Worlds within worlds.
That doesn't mean anything.
I can copy a file by holding my finger down on a phone.
Well, so can a monkey.
Now, you're describing a system for animals.
Terrestrial slobs bound to the earth by their meaty feet.
I designed a system for gods.
Oh, come on.
You know what you've done.
You know how lame virtual reality is.
You know the damage it caused mid-90s cinema.
I mean, Michael Douglas walking around like a jackass, moving files with a magic glove?
Lawnmower Man?
Did you see Lawnmower Man?
You bet your sweet ass I saw Lawnmower Man.
I consulted on it.
Took Brigitte Nielsen to the premiere.
We were building worlds within worlds.
And now you're living in homes within campers within parking lots, and using an iPad to clearly design what looks like a ripoff of Angry Birds.
Get out.
Get out of my Winnebago!
You're not allowed to say that like it's a punishment.
I know what it's like to lie for a living, Elroy!
And you should know, it feels better to stop.
And my feet aren't meaty!
.
.
Britta, honey.
An unexpected treat.
This is a check for all the dirty money you have used to control and monitor me without my consent.
But we're not gonna cash this.
Well you can't.
I postdated it a year.
And in that year, I'm gonna get a new job, new friends, in a new city where you and your spies can never find me.
Oh, please.
Don't do this.
What choice do you leave me?
Who acts this dishonestly towards their own daughter?
What choice do you leave us?
I mean, every time we get too close, you run off.
We sent you a birthday card to your apartment in New York, and then next week you're setting fire to a Jamba Juice in San Jose.
How long is that gonna stick with me?
Until arson is legal, sweetie, but your father's point is, we've arrived at the closest relationship you can tolerate.
Mm-hm.
We've learned, after a decade, how to love and admire and finance you from afar, through your friends, and the social media.
The Tinder and the like.
It's called Tumblr, dad.
No, I mean Tinder.
It's a matchmaking app, and by the way, if you were on Tinder-.
Your mom and I think you'd be the prettiest.
Absolutely, the boys would be swiping right.
Or girls!
Yes!
Whatever makes you happy.
Totally.
What has happened to you two?
Who are these doddering open-minded geezers?
Where are the people who wouldn't let me dress up like Prince for Halloween?
Or told me that the cat ran away because I tried alcohol?
Or had me drug tested when I was 11 because they said I was laughing too much?
We are definitely sorry about all of that stuff.
Quite frankly, we don't remember that stuff.
Oh, it's true.
Woodstock, oh!
Oh, my god.
.
I remember Woodstock!
Woodstock was amazing  but you have to realize, Britta, that your Woodstock, which was us being bad parents, that has more to do with you.
So that's what you remember, see?
Mm-hm.
Where are they?
Hm.
I'm sorry.
Get out here!
Britta, let me explain.
We were worried about you, so we just came over.
You can explain to each other in hell.
Friends don't visit each other's parents.
I hope you have a wonderful life.
.
Oh.
George, George, yes.
Britta, at least take some money and fix your car!
Or at least get a cab, or there are apps we can call where strangers pick you up.
I don't want your help.
Stop infantilizing me!
Hey, stop.
Stop!
Get out of here.
Hey!
.
Green Machine, nice.
Here, Greg, here, take some cash.
Holy crap!
What's her problem?
She's growing up.
Oh my god.
I put a tilde on this n!
I can do anything.
.
Any luck?
Ugh, I'm going home.
Oh, and to warn you, he joked about wanting a pee jar earlier and it's gradually becoming less of a joke.
Hey, Dean.
I'm coming over and I'm pulling you out of there.
I'll bite you.
I'll beat you up.
I'll like it and then I'll fire you and then I'll get right back in it.
I'll still get to beat you up.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Who is that?
I recognize that baritone voice and the scent of Tic Tacs with a tinge of Naugahyde.
It's Elroy Patashnik.
The architect.
Listen, I've come to tell you something very important about this system.
It's lame.
What?
I wasted your time with it and 10 crucial years of America's time.
I'm giving Mr. Winger your refund.
I don't want a refund.
I wanna stay in here forever and you can't stop me.
Die.
.
How long has he been in there?
Four hours.
Oh, I was thinking weeks.
Ha.
Yep!
This guy runs your school?
To use a phrase I coined in the 90s,  I'm going in.
You coined that?
Oh yeah, lock and load.
That's mine too.
All right.
.
I'm awake.
Aah!
Oh my God!
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
What are you doing in my car?
I didn't have anywhere else to go.
No where else but my car?
Do you know how big the planet is?
What is going on, Britta?
My friends, they all think my parents are adorable, and they think that I'm the bad guy for hating them, but I have a right to hate them, cuz I had to be there when they sucked.
Yeah.
Jimmy Fallon syndrome.
I get it.
I had that with my parents, too.
You did?
Yeah.
You know, one of the most unfair lessons we're forced to learn is that our parents are human beings.
We wanna think of them as gods or demons, because then that would make us heroes.
But give me a break.
We all suck.
What can I do to help you tonight, Britta?
How many quarters were in this cup holder?
The same amount.
.
Oh, yeah.
Calibrated.
Welcome.
No, go away!
Preferences grow.
.
No, no, no.
Let go of me.
Do you really want the power of a god?
Yes, more than anything.
Should I order dinner, cuz a lot of good delivery places are closing?
I know how you feel.
The sadder reality, the less real we want it.
I just wanna be a good dean.
I can give you a device that will accomplish that.
Oh!
You can use this to manipulate worlds.
Flick of a wrist.
Ha!
My god, it's incredible!
Now!
.
What's happening.
No!
Ow.
I wanna go back in.
I want to be back in there.
I want to be-.
Here.
Here.
Here's your power.
Yeah.
Now, manipulate worlds.
Yeah.
He'll be back to his old self in an hour.
Great, do you have a way to fix that?
.
Seriously, though, thank you.
Mm hm.
Britta, we were so worried.
What happened to the kid's Green Machine?
What?
I, I don't know.
I ditched it.
Where and how long ago?
Okay, assume that's not what's important here.
Britta, we-.
It's okay, Dad.
I have something that I wanna say.
I ran away from home at 17 to become an adult, but maybe all that did was leave a part of me stuck at 17, the part that tends to run away when I am confronted with the truth.
The truth is good, Britta.
Mom, shut up!
Frankie taught me something important.
It doesn't matter how mature we are or what resentments we carry.
All that matters is that we're all going to die.
You have a lovely home.
Thank you.
So, we're really getting our daughter back?
Yeah, but it's not gonna be that big of a deal.
I mean, you guys missed the good years.
Now, it's just gonna be margaritas, Pottery Barn, fighting our family's tendency toward obesity as we slide into oblivion.
First you guys, and then me quickly thereafter.
Well, I'll drink to that.
Oh, Abed.
Benjamin.
I got bit by a cat, Deb.
No!
I'll get the antibiotics.
Thank you for the refund, Elroy.
No, thank you for one last taste of what it was like when my work was valuable.
Oh, it's still valuable.
Here, $500 for the taste I got of being powerful.
Dean, the school can't afford 500-.
Wait for it.
I have no idea what to do with the rest of my life now.
We offer a wide variety of classes.
And that, my friend, is the Greendale effect.
I'll never get out of here, will I?
I haven't met many that do.
Let's walk arm in arm.
There are times when change needs to be different, then there's changes that are more the same.
But the same changes don't tend to be different than the changes that came before.
If you change everything that's different, sometimes you find out everything's still the same.
As for me, I'm just changing everything that's different.
Change.
.
_ _ _  _ _ _ _ _ _ .
_ _ _ _ _ Aah!
_ _ _ _ _ _ Did you get any of that?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Frankie, are you awake?
I'm in bed, but I only rest half my brain.
Go.
Greendale in jeopardy.
Need to call emergency meeting ASAP.
No time to explain.
I can be at the school in 30 minutes and I'll have the dean notify the others.
Could you notify the others?
You don't think the dean can handle it?
Do what you think is best.
Annie Edison requesting emergency meeting at school in 30.
- Greendale in trouble.
- I'll notify the others.
I can do that if you like.
I think I can handle notifying others, thank you very much.
Annie, Jeffrey, emergency meeting at the school in 30 minutes.
I already know.
I'm the one calling the meeting.
What up, yo?
Who is this other number?
It's a group text.
I'm texting you and Jeffrey.
It's me.
I am Jeffrey, best friend of Dean.
Hi, Jeffrey.
Hmm.
Dean, that number is not in my phone as Jeff's.
And it doesn't even look like an American phone number.
Oh, my God.
How stupid can I get?
You never told me you gave Annie a fake phone number.
Yes, Dean.
This is me, Jeffrey.
You are best friend.
Hold on, I'll cover.
You're right, I had the wrong number.
See you at the school.
I am so sorry, Jeffrey.
I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
No worries, Dean.
I love you.
You're always so sweet when we're texting, but then in real life, grr.
Bro, I just secret that way with love.
You know my style.
We keep loving in text, but then secret forever.
Meow.
- Meow.
- Meow.
Annie, if you're not dying, I'm gonna murder you.
I had to remove my night cream.
It's $200 an ounce.
It's 3 a.m. In the freaking morning.
What gives you the right to haul us in here?
Chang, how did you even find out about this?
I have a right to be here.
Hi.
- Why are you so awake?
- I have a theory.
Britta may be twins.
- No, I was working.
- At the bar?
- Does that mean you're drunk?
- Could a drunk person do this?
Hi, everybody.
Jeffrey.
Okay, 41 minutes ago, I received this e-mail from a friend that interns at KZBC.
- The TV station?
No, the unrelated, totally random combination of those four letters.
Mee-yow.
Heads Up.
Annie, still going to Greendale?
Thought you should know City College is running a negative ad about your school at 7 a.m. Heard it's pretty bad".
Let me see that.
City College is running an attack ad?
That's a first.
They're desperate.
Our registration numbers are trending upward.
Because the population keeps growing and no one here ever graduates.
Actually, our numbers are up because of improvements Frankie's made.
Those improvements were only possible through your hard work, Annie.
- Get a boardroom.
- Interesting.
When were you gonna share the whole truth about this, not just the parts that suit you?
- What?
- "P.S., I was glad to hear Brenda's doing better"?
Huh?
Huh?
Just because City College is scared doesn't mean they're not dangerous.
Is there anything in particular they could smear us with?
Nothing in particular just overlapping clouds of many thousands and thousands of things.
- Don't forget the Brenda factor.
- There isn't a Brenda factor.
He says she's doing better.
Better than what?
Her thyroid condition.
Can you focus?
- Can Brenda?
- Probably more so now.
- We need to see this ad before it airs.
- I'm getting a copy.
I have friends in the AV Department at City College.
The brotherhood of AV exists beyond your factionalism.
We serve only Video, the true queen, and her consort, Audio.
Could you be bigger nerds?
No, we've achieved our maximum potential.
Well, Annie's right.
We do have a situation here.
So we will make this our situation room.
Yes.
We need white boards, cork boards, laptops Clocks with different times, a red phone a big map with tiny Nazi tanks, and/or a Godzilla.
The ad airs at 7 a.m. That means we have four hours and 13 minutes to figure out what they're throwing at us and how to respond.
You know, it's the darndest thing.
I think Britta somehow crapped in my pants too.
- Heh.
I'd better head home.
- You can't just leave a situation room.
It's only a situation room because she called it that.
I mean, I could declare it a cookie room.
There are no cookies.
There is a situation.
You guys, where's the Greendale spirit?
Where's the pride?
- I'm fine.
- Found it.
She was wondering around campus without pants.
- What's going on here?
- Situation room.
- What's the situation?
- Brenda's thyroid.
Sorry to hear that.
Keep the pants.
I'm going back to bed.
- I'm going with him.
- I'm gonna watch.
Got it.
Downloading it now.
You work hard to earn your degree.
And your school should work hard to make that degree valuable.
So why is Greendale Community College giving degrees to dogs?
In 2001, a Staffordshire terrier named Ruffles took up residence on Greendale's campus.
By 2008, Ruffles had earned a bachelor's degree.
Not a two-year degree, a four-year degree.
Where will you get your degree?
If the answer is Greendale, prepare to get boned.
Paid for by City College.
License 264392.
Did we give a degree to a dog?
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Ugh.
Okay.
It's okay.
It's all right.
So this is Greendale, not City College?
I'm gonna get more pants.
They've been calling me in to do more stuff.
It's exciting.
We'll be lucky if we get in three words The first step is to pool our facts.
The most important one being: Dean Pelton, did Greendale Community College give a degree to a dog?
Oh.
I seem to recall No.
No way.
There's absolutely no way.
- Not that dog.
- "That dog"?
You remember the dog.
Was it enrolled in classes?
- Mm - How are these hard questions?
Why are these the questions you're asking?
You don't wanna know if a dog got a degree here?
It's not important.
What I wanna know is did a dog get a degree here in any way that can be proven?
- Oh, I like that, Jeffrey.
- I don't like that.
I like the truth.
Play lawyer on your own time.
This is my own time.
You wanted me invested?
Well, this dump cuts my paychecks, and I've got three hours to defend it.
So how many seconds of that should I waste on truth?
Which is an artificial construct that rarely holds up in court and has never changed the outcome of a fight.
- Sorry you have to see him like this.
- He's right.
If City College can't support their claim, it's libel.
We can have the station pull the ad.
But that is precisely why the truth does matter.
The Brenda Paradox.
I found the dog.
I also found a lot of Social Security numbers.
- This Internet has gone too far.
- Yeah.
- She's registered as a border terrier.
- They said Staffordshire.
Isn't that something?
We've known this animal 30 seconds and she's already unreliable.
- Who is the real Ruffles?
- I'm sorry.
Our strategy is to go after the dog?
Our strategy is denial, which includes discrediting the source.
Abed, can you make an attack ad?
Jeff wants me to make an attack ad.
So why is he a pedophile?
- Just demonstrating the formula.
- Refine your technique as you go.
I wanna know everything about this Ruffles.
She thinks she went to this school, fine but maybe she thinks cat turds are delicious.
And maybe she barks just a little bit more at black mailmen.
And she's spayed now, but how many puppies are out there?
You do this, we're no better than City College.
We've never been better than City College.
We gave a degree to a dog.
Allegedly.
This conversation is privileged.
I could do a Banksy-style stencil of a dog and spray-paint it all over the school.
- That sounds great.
First, why don't you go get a bunch of coffee, drink all of it then go get some more and bring it back here?
- I actually love that idea.
- I'll go with her.
She's wearing my pants.
I know this is crazy, but I'm gonna go check the school records to see if you know, we gave a degree to a dog.
- We didn't.
- That's good.
You guys go find that truth you love so much.
If it's the kind we can use, bring it back.
If not, you know, stuff gets lost.
No.
No.
Bad.
We are better than City College.
We always have been.
Which is why I know that we did not give a degree to a dog.
I say we fight fire with fire.
City College tries to embarrass us we should embarrass them, right?
- Right.
I say I go to City College with a camera shoot a really gross porno movie on their campus and put it online.
- Fine.
- Cool.
Wait, what?
It's very inspiring to watch you work.
You are inspiring too.
In what way?
I need olives.
Can you bring me olives?
Not again.
You did this a month ago then I brought them to you and you acted like you hated them.
It's only my style to be secret.
Please bring me five can of olives.
Five cans?
But don't believe me if I say I don't like.
I'm just pretending I hate olives.
Honestly, I couldn't care less if they gave a dog a degree.
Me neither.
Ha-ha-ha.
In fact, I kind of hope they did.
- Why is that?
- I don't know.
They all treat me like I'm a joke.
But if a dog got a degree, that means we're all a joke.
- Mm.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Whoa.
Natalie is Freezing?
- You know them?
- Yeah, I know them.
But how do you?
You're - Black?
- No.
Old.
Oh.
Sorry, I just meant that When I was into them, I was like 15.
And I was 40.
I never really listened to music when I was growing up.
I was in my own world.
But one day at work, I heard this sound it was "Pillar of Garbage".
Oh, that is their best song.
Best song.
- I got it right here.
- Would you play it?
Yeah.
You know what?
Those guys are gonna need coffee if they're gonna keep that dog from having a degree.
There are things at stake here.
I get that now.
Mm.
I found the smell.
- Someone filed a taco.
- Wha?
"Things That Will Otherwise Get Filed Straight To My Thighs".
Hmm.
So I know you agree with me that we need to find the truth but do you agree that the truth won't be horrible?
I'm not psychic, Annie.
That's an illusion caused by extreme preparedness.
But what do you hope is true?
Oh, God, no, I never hope.
Hope is pouting in advance.
Hope is faith's richer, bitchier sister.
Hope is the deformed, attic-bound, incest monster offspring of entitlement and fear.
My life results tripled when I gave up hope and every game on my phone that had to do with farming.
What's true will be true, Annie.
Our job is to deal with that truth.
You sound a little like Jeff.
Jeff said I sound like Abed.
I wonder if Britta thinks I sound like Chang.
I assume Chang thinks I sound like distant explosions and crying babies.
You know, he's unstable, right?
- Yep.
- Oh.
A transcript for Ruffles.
- You think that's our guy?
- I do.
Oh, my God.
So many classes.
See what hope does?
Screw you, Frankie.
I'm sorry, Annie, but I don't think you're seeing this for what it is.
It's a transcript for a dog.
A really, really long one.
It's proof that Jeff was right.
This school has no value.
Yeah.
But this folder has no degree.
Look.
- What's that?
- Heh-heh-heh.
Victory.
You know, within the context of Greendale.
- Would it be better if we?
- No.
Never know until you try.
- Never know until I try.
- What?
- I said we're quite a team.
- Here's the coffee.
Let me know if there's anything else I can do.
- We could use fresh eyes on this cut.
- We could?
- Has anyone told you you're difficult?
- Everyone in your line of work.
This is Ruffles.
She'd like you to believe she's a graduate and a good girl.
But Ruffles is anything but.
When Ruffles moved into her neighborhood in 2007 dead squirrels went up by 17 percent.
Coincidence?
Ask this bunny.
Ruffles stole cookies from a Girl Scout, impersonated a lobster had 27 children with five different fathers and according to one local doctor, has worms.
Ruffles might claim she doesn't.
Ruffles claims a lot of things.
Maybe that's why Ruffles once spent time on death row.
Not a lobster, not a student, not a good dog.
Paid for by Humanity Versus Ruffles.
I wanted the voice-over to be like James Earl Jones but the James Spader impersonator turned out pretty good.
I wish he'd leave, though.
- You really let that dog have it.
- Yeah.
Which I realize is important now.
Is it okay if I crash on?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing at all.
I wouldn't say that.
You put five huge cans of olives next to me.
Just something I felt like doing.
This isn't the first time you've done this.
I'm really confused by this.
- Is it code for something?
- I don't know.
And I don't care.
Jackpot, relative to Greendale.
Oh, my God.
Look at this course load.
This dog was an animal.
- Most of them were attendance based.
- How is this good news?
"Unpaid library fees, $15.
Diploma withheld until payment remitted".
No degree.
The commercial's a lie.
I'm gonna call the station and have them pull the ad.
Eat crap, Ruffles, and not just your own.
- Guys.
Let it go.
- What are you talking about?
The sad truth is that a dog can get a degree here.
Yeah, but the happy truth is none did.
There's a difference between truth and honesty.
Library dues?
Who cares?
Ruffles put the work in, relative to Greendale.
That City College ad may be technically a lie but it's really dishonest to kill it on a technicality.
And dragging this dog's name through the mud?
That's worse than dishonest.
That's evil.
Evil?
I'll cop to silly.
Some things are silly and evil, like candy cigarettes.
And remember when Flavor Flav had that reality show?
I don't own a TV.
Honestly, I think the most honest thing we can do right now the only thing that will make us better than City College is to let that ad run and take our lumps.
Annie, this started with me sleeping and getting yelled at for not helping.
If it ends with you yelling at me for not sleeping, that's not a story that's a German art film.
What?
Let it go.
I am a female student being physically overpowered by a male teacher!
Damn it.
Britta, get her.
- Frankie, get her.
- Annie, sweetie think about this practically.
If being better than City College means letting them destroy us what is the point?
If surviving means being like them, what's the point?
Why not let one school die and enroll at the one where my grades matter?
If those are your terms If the price of that transcript is you transferring we accept.
Personally, I hope you're bluffing.
Yeah?
Well, here's what hope gets you.
Hope and a dollar forty-nine will get you a candy bar.
- A buck seventy-nine.
- Are you serious?
Jesus.
Have fun with your lying, cheating dog-smearing, truth-blurring trouser-swapping school!
I remember when candy bars were 50 cents.
If someone says, "Hey, I just joined Mensa" or, "I consider myself a post-modern this or that".
You could say, "Yeah, that and 50 cents will get you a candy bar".
Or, "That and a quarter will get you a phone call".
Heh.
It was easier to be unimpressed back then.
I mean, it was literally cheaper.
Elroy, we're kind of bummed out right now.
- Annie just left.
- Oh.
Were you guys close?
- Abed, I don't wanna talk right now.
- Okay.
The Greendale ad is gonna go up any time now.
You might wanna see it.
- I don't wanna be a part of that.
- Trust me.
This is Ruffles.
Ruffles was a student in Greendale Community College.
She came really close to getting a degree.
Which means two things.
She's an exceptional dog and Greendale really needs to get its **** together.
We're working on it.
We're working hard.
And the good news is, when you work hard at Greendale no matter who or what you are, it pays off.
Right, Ruffles?
Jesus.
Greendale Community College.
You're already accepted.
You guys.
I knew you wouldn't do that to Ruffles.
- You hoped.
- I hoped and it worked.
- Hope points.
- Hope points.
You do understand that what we did was the most prudent tactical move?
Getting in front of the scandal, Letterman style.
Yes, Jeff, don't worry.
I promise I'll never mistake you for having a heart.
- Thank you.
- Ahem.
Kiss City College goodbye.
- I did it.
- Did what?
That stuff we talked about.
- Who are you?
- I'm the plumber.
- Why?
- Here's why.
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my - Oh!
- Ugh.
- Is this pornography?
- Doy.
- You're the only actor.
- So?
- What kind of lens is this?
- Who cares?
You might be a genius.
Why did you do this?
What parent will let their kid go to this school if a porn got shot there?
You shot it in front of a wall that could be anywhere.
And you're wearing your Greendale T-shirt.
Okay, genius, but the title is Chang Does Greendale Oh, wait.
Reshoot.
Forty thousand yen in data charges?
!
I'm looking at my son, but all I see is the ghost of your uncle!
I imagine many people look the same when you reduce them all to finance.
In your eyes I am the enemy because I'm the edge of your world but when your eyes move past me, they will weep.
Tokyo is a machine, caked with blood, running on flesh.
I reduce you?
You will learn true reduction.
You will be as small as me.
The Dean?
Hellos.
Are you in trouble?
Is everything okay?
Is life hard everywhere?
Is everyone alone?
All the time.
Are you at home, Jeffrey?
Should I come over?
You cannot come to me.
I must confession you.
I am not Jeffrey.
I understand.
I rarely know who I am.
No, I mean, I am not Jeffrey.
Let it out.
I am Takashi.
I am teenage boy in Tokyo.
I think we all are sometimes.
I am sorry for making fun before, but now I need a friend.
Why don't I bring you some olives tomorrow, Jeffrey?
I am not Jeffrey.
I am not the dean.
I often think about that night.
Such a small event but ultimately, the moment that would lead me to becoming oyabun, highest leader of the Yakuza.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
"Always scare Daniel-san, Miyagi hate fighting".
"Miyagi hate fighting".
- Line?
- "Yeah, but you like karate".
Right, right, yeah, but, y you like karate though.
So?
- Line.
- Chang, the audition's at 3.00.
Maybe I shouldn't go, you know, maybe I'm a bad actor.
Being good is a fraction of acting.
It takes discipline and confidence.
Discipline, confidence.
Okay from the top.
"Always scare Daniel-san.
Miyagi hate fighting".
Line.
I heard Karate Kid quotes.
Chang is auditioning for the stage adaptation of Karate Kid downtown.
Yeah, and it's for the part of Daniel LaRusso.
- You got a problem with that, racist?
- No, you're acting now?
- Yeah, you got a problem with that?
- I'm clear.
They took my snake, and they turned it into a plumber.
They made the eggs, into barrels.
The pine tree they made into a gorilla, but I recognized my design.
Donkey Kong my ass.
That's construction snake.
- I don't practice law anymore.
- But, we have a case, right?
- Isn't everyone you'd be suing dead?
- That's not cool, man.
- Why would a tree throw eggs at a snake?
- Why would a plumber be fighting a monkey?
I don't know, I don't know.
The Wi-Fi's still broken.
- What happened to good morning?
- It's a bad morning, no Wi-Fi.
Yeah, we really need Wi-Fi.
Okay, let's not get carried away.
We need oxygen.
We have oxygen, we need Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi.
Okay, enough, right?
Look what I'm doing, look.
Fix, Wi-Fi.
Mm-hm, okay, boom and boom.
All right.
I, I'm trying to find the IT lady.
My emails to her get bounced back to me in Aramaic, and when I call, I hear an undulating high-pitched whistle that makes my nose bleed.
Well, sounds like a bad IT lady, right?
Frankie, hire a new IT lady.
I'm pretty handy with technology.
I'm assuming it's still the same, smaller holes, more bytes.
- Now what are we up to now, mega?
- Tera.
Tera.
They did it, those bastards.
They finally did it.
Frankie, hire Elroy.
Elroy, you're the IT lady.
- Can I be his assistant?
- Not for money.
- Can I be his friend?
- Elroy, Abed is your friend.
Now the real reason I came by, I'm dying.
Not really, but imagine how bad you feel for complaining about the Wi-Fi.
Here's the real reason.
Too short?
It is too short?
It's not too short?
You people are no help.
School board come in.
School board, you're surrounded.
If this is about the bonfire, we'll put it out when the weather breaks.
We come in peace.
We've had our ups and downs, but as of right now.
We love this school, and love what you're doing with it.
What?
Why?
What would you think about moving up?
Well.
Joining us on the board?
Me?
I would love to be on the school board.
- Awesome.
- Awesome.
One, one more thing.
You're gay, right?
I mean, like openly gay.
I'm not openly anything, and gay doesn't begin to cover it.
No, no.
Oh, I get it.
This is about the uproar over you guys cancelling the pride parade, for a school board parade.
Those guys get to dress fancy all year.
- No, no.
- We have one day!
No, this isn't about that.
This is about adding a new face to the board.
But, if that new face happened to be openly gay, it would be because we're so tolerant.
And always were.
But, that's for us to deal with.
The question you have to ask is, am I openly gay?
Because, if you are that gayness could be a rocket, thrusting you to new gay heights.
And if you're not.
Well, there's a lot of gay guys out there.
I assume that's the selling point of the lifestyle.
You know, I, I, I never thought about it that way.
Well, I have.
Cutting women out of sex, it's genius.
Gay dean.
Gay dean.
Gay dean.
Gay dean.
I'm begging you to be a gay dean of the school board.
This should lead to the router.
Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back back.
Wh, wh, what's going on?
There's a birds nest in there, with babies in it.
The mother must have built it there because of the heat.
Same reason my mom took my half brother to Arizona.
That's probably why the Wi-Fi's down, we'll have to move it.
If you move them the mother won't come back.
Those birds aren't the new IT lady, I am.
I'll move it carefully.
The mother won't come back.
Kid, animals have been murdering each other for 3 billion years.
Birds have had their 15 million in the spotlight.
The same as lizards and plants and they all just use it to murder, eat, screw and not invent Wi-Fi.
Now we may end up saving this world, or blowing it to hell or making a new one.
But we can't do any of it while scheduling our evolution around the needs of the least lucky birds.
What are you, a demon?
Did Clive Barker write you?
Anyone who finds that nest, will come to the same decision.
And you don't have to get mean.
Mean?
You just did a baby bird murder monologue.
Maybe they're close to leaving the nest, until then can't you just stall by doing what real IT people do?
- What's that?
- Exactly.
I've got one year to make it all work, and that's what I'm gonna do, make it work, all of it.
This place is intimidating.
You're gonna do great.
Next up, Ben Chang, for the role of Daniel LaRusso.
Thank you.
Daniel-san, why you want learn karate?
- Hang on a second.
- Sorry, I can do better.
Zip it.
Who are you?
Oh, I'm Annie, a friend of Chang's.
You mind coming up here and reading with your friend?
Okay, if it helps.
- "Daniel-san, what you want"?
- Okay, no, sorry, no.
You read Daniel-san.
You read Miyagi.
We'll do scene seven, Miyagi's office.
- Are you the repairman?
- Aye.
- The faucet's really leaky there.
- Aye.
- When you gonna fix it?
- After.
- After what?
- After after.
Tell everyone else to go home.
We got the parts!
Hear, hear.
Parts plural?
Well yeah, Annie got my part and I got the Asian part.
Chang Stop!
We were cast as Mr. Miyagi and the Karate Kid, because we're a good team!
We're a team, because one of us is so talented she got cast outside her gender and the other one, got cast because of eye shape.
I am not letting you sabotage yourself like this.
Let's say you're right.
And like Sidney Poitier or Meg Ryan before you, you were cast for race.
It's what the actor does with the role they get, that matters.
- All right?
- You're right.
All right, IT lady.
How goes it?
- I found your problem.
- And?
I'll need a little time to fix it.
Wow, need time to fix it?
You sound just like you work in IT.
I've got some interesting news, the school board, offered me a position.
Great.
Cool.
Well I got a part in a play and we were sort of talking about that, so read the room Pelton.
- Are you gonna take the job?
- I don't know, there's a catch.
Jeffrey, Frankie, could I see you in my office please?
They want you to be a token homosexual?
It's a form of progress, 30 years ago, the most power an openly gay could achieve was a center square.
- But I'm not just gay.
- What does that mean?
If coming out is a magic show, and gayness is the rabbit out of the hat, I'm one of those never-ending handkerchiefs.
The sad truth, Craig?
Anything other than straight, is plenty gay for a school board.
The most important point is, are you prepared to make your sexuality, which is nobody's business, an aspect of your role in society?
I know I'm not, so I don't.
No?
When a person becomes symbolic they gain symbolic power, at the price of independent power.
Yep.
That's an excellent point.
It could be good for Greendale, for one of our own to be on the school board.
I mean the fact that you'd be leaving a few items off your list of your turn-ons, I mean, the goal in politics, isn't transparency, it's winning.
- That's why the politicians always win.
- They do always win, don't they?
But now I get a chance to win.
I could change the system from the inside out.
And all I have to do is pare down my sexuality to simple gayness, which is heavily in the mix.
There you go.
Get ready, America.
Dean Pelton is coming out as approximately two-sevenths of what he is.
Come on.
Don't leave me hanging.
There we go.
I am so curious.
- Oh.
- Intellectually.
All right.
This is a pretty basic scene.
No real subtext.
Let's just get it up on its feet.
There's no wrong answers.
Okay?
Great.
Go.
Hey, come fix faucet.
Oh, Karate, learn from book?
Yeah.
And a few classes back at the Y in Jersey where I'm from.
What happened I?
Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there.
I guess there are wrong answers.
Quick adjustment, Ben.
- Yeah?
- Act better.
Act better.
Thanks.
Annie, you're doing great.
Keep doing what you're doing.
Oh.
- Can I ask about by motiv - Keep me from puking is your motivation.
Stop making me want to quit the theater and kill myself.
Go.
After "what happened I. Oh.
Okay.
Hey.
I fell off my bike.
Hm.
Lucky no hurt hand.
Okay.
Can I see this tool box?
Great.
This is good.
Got it.
I got distracted cuz the tools were doing a better job than you.
What happened I?
Say it.
What happened I. Liar.
Stop lying to me.
Say it.
- What happened I. - What happened actor?
You crying?
You cry when I tell you to cry.
So reabsorb that disgusting droplet of salt and bad choices back into your doughy body.
And then call your mother to see if you can be reabsorbed back into her doughy body or so help me God, I will take that tear, I will freeze it, and I will stab you in the eye with it, you waste of a soul-shaped hole forgotten by God.
Okay.
What should I Annie, don't change a thing, you're perfect.
Unless you want to.
Okay.
All right I'm Rich Countee, this is my man Carl.
We work on the school board.
- Yeah, we do.
- We have some exciting news for you.
Your own dean, Craig Pelton, has been selected to join the board of Colorado Community Colleges, and I'll just, go, go ahead Dean.
Guys.
Talk.
Okay.
Hello Greendale.
As you know, this is something I wanted for a very long time and I wanted to thank all of the people at Greendale that helped me achieve this and my partner, Domingo.
- Very proud of my Craig.
- Oh, that's, but, oh, oh.
And now let's open it up to some questions.
- Dean.
- Dean.
As a gay dean, what is your opinion about the recent controversy surrounding the cancelled Pride Parade, and do you think you were selected to join the board because of your sexual preference?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I would just like to say that we are very proud to have Mr. Pelton on the board, whatever his lifestyle may be.
Which happens to be gay!
Which is great, but irrelevant!
Hey, it gets better!
Oh good.
We're so happy.
- I feel like scum.
- Gay people are scum?
Hey, don't play that card with me young man.
I make gayness look like Mormonism.
I don't like being this dishonest.
Dean, I want to say thanks for doing this.
I never knew.
I mean, people talked, but Sure, well, it really doesn't have anything to do with my work.
Yeah, but it's helpful, to me.
You know, and to a lot of us, so.
Thank you.
Hm.
Confine yourself to your role, Domingo.
And lose the attitude.
Hare krishna.
Krishna krishna.
Oh, Daniel-san, you much-a humor.
Hm, okay.
Let's stop there.
I'm not gonna hit you.
And it's not because it's illegal, and it's certainly not because I'm afraid you know karate because there is nothing about your performance that is believable.
See, we only hit things, that effect us.
I don't hit water, or old mayonnaise.
Or the air after a fart has dissipated.
And I'm not hitting you.
You are the worst actor I've ever directed and I've directed both Wahlbergs!
From the top!
Danny does a bit with the floor sanders, Miyagi is amused, and Kenny gets me another god damned cup of coffee with six Splendas in it!
Hare Krishna.
He's so mean to Chang.
I don't know what to do.
You could just drop out of the play.
Well, you know I could.
Or Chang could.
I mean, the director is not being mean to me.
But you talked Chang into auditioning and then you got his part and now he's suffering.
- You're right, I should threaten to quit.
- Or just quit.
Well, if I threaten to quit maybe that will be enough for him to stop abusing Chang.
I was kind of born to act, Britta.
When I do it, I can feel it pleasing the universe.
- That's dramatic.
- See?
The internet says that if they're sparrows they'll be flying in less than 12 days.
If they're albatrosses, we're in trouble.
Albatrosses have a 270 day fledgling period.
Thanks for guarding the nest with me.
Uh-oh.
This is what you do when you're working?
Must be nice.
All right, look.
There's a bird's nest in the router.
Now if you want to fire me, fire me.
Either way, until those birds are gone nobody gets any closer.
Well of course not.
If you move them the mother won't come back.
Keep up the good work.
Show me wax on.
This is the worst acting I've ever seen in my life.
Show me wax, off.
The ghost of your father just turned his back on you.
Your ancestors are clawing their way deeper into the Earth to get away from you, you make me embarrassed to have thumbs, I can see air quotes around you.
Show me, paint fence.
Knock, knock, knock, anybody home?
Oh look, there's nobody here, oh it's so dusty, it's almost like nobody's been here in years.
There's a note.
"Never let me act".
Mr. Lundergard, I'm sorry, but I cannot stand by while you do this.
- That's fine, you can go.
- I'm not bluffing.
You can't make an actor more talented by yelling at them.
And if you don't stop, your lead character is going to walk.
Lead?
You play Danny LaRusso.
Well I'm the Karate Kid.
The Karate Kid is about Kesuke Miyagi, an immigrant who fought against his own people in World War II, while his wife lost a child in an internment camp.
Noriyuki Morita was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance.
Ralph Macchio?
Showed up.
I cast you because your measurements allow me to use the same wardrobe as last year.
I cast Ben because he has the sadness and talent that could make this show great.
If I have to physically drill into his chest and suck it out with a straw!
So you can take a flying kick and a rolling donut!
You're fired.
But I'm talented, too, right?
What?
No.
Really?
Really?
Oh my God!
You're like doing a terrible Vinnie Barbarino up here.
But, like, I know you're not capable of anything better, so, that's why I've been so nice to you.
Take care Annie.
Yikes, right?
What a diva.
- Thanks for sticking up for me.
- No problem?
From now on, she's dead to us.
Hey gay Dean, we got a problem here.
You ring the local papers?
You've shut down the campus Wi-Fi until a nest of baby birds can grow?
That's a little too gay.
I didn't do it because I'm gay.
Wait, I'm not gay.
Oh, that did not just get said to us.
You are gay.
You are openly gay and we love it.
But now we are dealing with more flak from conservatives for appointing you than we ever did from gays for not having one of you.
Yeah, and the gays aren't coming to your side.
You know why?
Because the whole point is to get a job by being gay and then to do as good of job as the normals.
That's what the gays want.
They don't want a gay dean who acts like a weird gay monster.
- I'm not a gay dean.
- Whoa, not Cool, man.
Don't bring us into your web of lies.
Well, now what do you want me to do?
Figure it out, gay dean.
Figure it out.
- Hey, Domingo.
- Hey, what's up?
Guys, the school needs Wi-Fi, and my job is to run the school.
The school doesn't need baby birds.
- The nest needs to be moved.
- You are not crossing this line.
- I'm taping this.
This is on video.
- Guys This is two white security guards versus one unarmed black man and two baby birds.
Your move.
Stand down.
Stand down.
No security, no weapons.
Just one unarmed black man versus one unarmed, openly gay dean.
Now move that nest, please.
Just a hair back Domingo, it's like you're breathing for me.
I have called this press conference because I have been less than honest with the public.
You know me as the openly gay dean of Greendale Community College, but that doesn't even begin to describe what I really am.
I belong to one of the most marginalized and least openly honest groups in America.
I am a politician.
Now what does that mean?
Are politicians like you?
Well we look like you, but we will say and do whatever we have to in order to acquire and keep our jobs.
It means nothing I say and very few of the things I think can be trusted.
I am tired of being in this particular closet so I am coming out now.
I only hope that you can accept an openly political person on your board.
If not, I understand.
Thank you.
It's just faster if I get to my office this way.
We don't need any pictures of this.
I can't believe the Dean got kicked off the school board just for admitting he's political.
Yeah.
Some groups take longer than others to gain acceptance.
We like our politicians in the closet because we're afraid, deep down, we're all a little political.
- Any of you guys smell a bird murderer?
- I came here to apologize.
Well, I hope your apology comes with a beak and hollow bones and a special magnet in its head it uses to migrate.
- You skipped wings.
- Insects have wings.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Abed.
I lost myself in a role.
It won't happen again.
Two of them died.
There's one left.
He's hanging on, but I'm worried he's turning into a symbol of my own innocence.
- Isn't Chang's play tonight?
- If any of you go, you're supporting abuse.
Oh, dial it back, Annie.
Well, I'm definitely in.
It'll be interesting to see how his fake crying is different from his real crying.
Well I'm a big fan of the performing arts, but I'll go to Chang's play anyway.
Karate Kid adaptation?
Karate Kid adaptation?
Okay.
I might.
I'm catching up.
Directors have a saying.
Actors are worthless, empty-headed homunculi, but the right one, in the right role can change the world.
Hm, I have found the right one.
He's found the right role, and tonight, your world changes.
You're welcome.
- He replaced me with Annie Kim.
- Shh.
Hee-ah!
Ow.
Sorry.
You okay?
You must be the new people in apartment 20.
What was that?
Karate?
Yeah, you know?
Hey, me and some of my friends are gonna have a party at the beach later.
You should come.
- Hey!
Are you the repair man?
- Aye.
- Faucet's really leaking there.
- Aye.
- When are you gonna fix it?
- After.
- After what?
- After, after.
Come ask, leave boy alone to train.
You got a lot of nerve, old man.
But I like that.
I like that.
- Name a place.
- Tournament.
Yes, sir.
Regret to inform wife, sir.
Complication at birth, sir.
No doctor, it can't.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
- Please forgive me.
- Shh.
No need fight anymore, you proved point.
What?
That I could take a beating?
Every time I see those guys, they'll know they got the best of me.
Close eye.
Get up, Daniel.
Get up!
Yeah, woo woo!
- You all right, LaRusso?
- Yeah, you missed my head.
We did it, Mister Miyagi.
We did it.
- I'm speechless.
- I forgot Chang was up there.
Me, too.
It's such a relief to be able to support him out of something other than fear.
I guess all that suffering Chang endured paid off.
It's not what the play suggests, but you have to wonder if it wouldn't have been better for Daniel to get beat up even more.
I am at a total loss about what lesson to learn from any of this.
Maybe that's the lesson.
Hm.
- I lost a button.
- Maybe we all lost a button.
Hey, hey guys!
Thank you so much.
- Hey, thank you for making me do this.
- You're welcome.
Congratulations.
- I'm jealous.
- No, no, don't be.
Believe me, I sit in my dressing room and all I dream about is a white picket fence and a dog.
I don't have those either.
Chang, let's go.
I guess all the actors go to some sort of actor bar together.
So, I'll see you guys at school.
Bye.
Hey, I know this great bar for people that don't hate themselves.
What do you say?
- My lady.
- My lord.
We are gathered here today to celebrate the release of this bird into these skies.
That its now fully formed wings may find purchase upon the four winds.
If anyone would like to say something, now's the time.
Oh, I'll always remember how you kept me from getting email for a week.
And that chirp you do when you want more bread.
Yeah, that one.
And now everyone, please put on your cat masks and finger wings.
With these cat masks, we remind you that this place can no longer be your home, but with the fluttering of these wings, we symbolically join your flight into the natural world.
Wings everyone.
Okay.
You can go now.
Yeah.
Off you go.
Time to go, little bird, that's just the way it is.
Whee!
Aw.
- Then it's done.
- You did the right thing, Abed.
Thanks to you, that bird has his whole bird life ahead of him, to fly, meet lady birds, even start a bird family.
You made a difference.
Aw.
Abed.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
- Why did Frankie call us here?
- I don't know.
Some financial prospect that could put the school in the black.
Which always confuses me because black means bad.
When it's a cat or a banana or a shirt that makes you think you've lost more weight than you have.
- Nice save.
Sorry about that, man.
- Huh?
What?
Did someone use the word "black" and now you want me to give you the all clear?
Please tell me that won't be my role.
I have a brain the size of Jupiter.
- I'm nobody's fourth Ghostbuster.
- No.
I promise this group does not think that way.
In fact, before you got here, they had two No.
They had to often step back and remind themselves that they weren't one collective ray of light.
Is this a cult?
Are you gonna eat me?
No.
We're fine.
I lived in New York.
Speaking of which, midterms are over and I was thinking we could have a party at our apartment.
- Abed?
Annie?
- You can have a party.
- Yes!
- You can't have a rager.
We have a rule against more than eight guests.
Eight guests?
That's not "not a rager".
That's not a party.
- Nice grammar.
- Okay.
You have a rule against parties, which I'm sure is a record for uptightness.
So let's celebrate that.
I'll bring the booze and more than eight guests.
Britta, you just moved in.
You don't even have a real bedroom.
You're a coucher.
She sleeps on the couch.
She's a coucher.
- So I get nothing?
- You get a couch.
You get a home.
- There's no government to overthrow.
- I'm not overthrowing.
- You're overthrowing if I say so.
- Nice irony.
Can we focus on this?
Because now this is happening.
Hello, everyone.
Don't be alarmed.
I'm attending our meeting using what's called a telepresence robot.
I resent the idea that this would alarm me.
These bots have been revolutionizing the private sector and now, the state of Colorado has come to us with a unique - Proposition.
- Seamless, Frankie.
The department of corrections will pay us money if we allow a small, manageable number of inmates to attend Greendale using these.
Now, hold on, are you trying to tell me that prisoners would use these things to come to our school?
That's the black guy in every sci-fi movie.
I'll allow it.
Wait.
Prisoners?
Rolling around the school?
- With students?
- They'll rape us.
They'll rape us all.
They can't rape you because their genitals will be hundreds of miles away.
From each other?
This is an attempt at rehabilitation.
The prison is looking for ways to expose their inmates to a real world academic environment.
Okay, I've heard enough.
I'm responsible for this school.
I won't have hardened criminals exposing themselves to it.
That's the response they're getting.
Which is why the state is offering a $300,000 incentive.
We'll do it.
Dean, do it, $300,000 for the school.
- They're convicts.
- They're iPads on sticks.
As someone that got paid to keep people out, let me tell you Hey, guys.
I'm moon walking.
- Not every bad guy ends up in prison and not every prisoner is a bad guy.
- Who's this guy?
- Three hundred thousand.
- Oh, yeah.
- Jeffrey.
You know ordinarily I'd do anything you say.
- Do it.
- Let's do it.
I walked into that one.
Gross.
Who farted?
Oh, wait, never mind.
I'm so glad you talked me into this.
Three hundred thousand dollars.
Look at us, running the school together.
If I'm running the school, pay me more.
What if I made you professor emeritus?
We could have a little ceremony - Does it pay more?
- No.
Then give me what the ceremony would cost.
Okay, folks, welcome.
I believe you all have maps of our campus.
This is your Dean.
Dean?
Now, if I see any race gangs forming I will have no choice but to adjust the contrast on your screens until you all look the same.
And we have a very strict no-bullying policy that relates directly to me, so be nice.
To me.
No need to be nervous.
We're all here because we done some bad stuff.
- But we ain't here to do any more.
- Aw.
That's very folksy, thank you.
So I guess just roll forth and rehabilitate.
They can see us and we can see them.
All right, knock it off.
No one at this school should pick on any class of people.
It's like watching magicians bully jugglers.
- What's your name?
- Willy.
Willy.
Take a seat.
I'm Mr. Jeff Winger.
I teach Fundamentals of Law.
Does that mean you can teach me how to get out?
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Probably not.
I was a phony lawyer.
I got caught and now I teach a pretty phony class.
It's an automatic A, but you might learn a thing or two.
And I mean literally a thing or two.
Cool?
- And they call me the criminal.
- Heh, heh, heh.
Trust me, I know the main difference between us is an orange jumpsuit.
- But you have an iPad.
- Ha, ha, ha.
Yeah, and I'm a murderer.
Now, now, don't worry.
I ain't proud of it.
I just don't hide it.
You know, once you take another man's life you carry it with you.
You carrying any murders, Mr. Winger?
I am not.
I hear you have to have strong feelings for someone you kill.
I reserve that stuff for myself.
All right.
That's enough law.
Who wants to watch Planet Earth?
Oh, look.
Ice worlds.
Oh, the majesty.
Rhinos and elephants and flamingos.
Hey, Abed.
Haven't you been in our apartment longer than Annie?
Yeah.
I remember when she first moved in.
I was so worried about pacing I was constantly laying groundwork for gags.
Hey, Annie.
I'd like to make this moment worth popping back to from the future.
I don't know what that means.
There.
Don't worry, it'll pay off.
Hey, Troy.
Glad I kicked that habit.
It was getting joyless.
What I'm saying is, by Annie's logic You're saying I could overrule Annie, let you have a party.
I don't get anything out of parties.
They're conventions for every subject too boring to have their own convention.
The police showed up when you made Leonard take off his clothes.
That was for my movie Reverse Godzilla.
I thought it might make a good popback.
I make movies, Annie makes rules, you make parties.
Her rules cancel out your parties, but I'm not involved.
I just make movies.
Evening, Mr. Winger.
Willy.
You're here late.
Taking some night classes.
Trying to take full advantage, you know?
Is this your car?
It's nice.
Looks like you're taking full advantage too.
Yeah.
It's a real dream gig.
Sarcasm.
Slick words.
Cock of the walk.
What are categories in Prison Jeopardy?
Hey, you mind helping me out with something?
I lost a ball-bearing and it rolled down them stairs.
- "Lost a ball bearing"?
- Mm-hm.
Down them stairs.
You want me to look down these stairs.
Okay.
Did you just try to murder me?
Are you trying to murder me?
You're trying as hard as you can right now to kill me.
Okay, well, uh, I guess I'll see you in class tomorrow guy who tried to murder me.
Oh, I'll see you in class tomorrow, Mr. Winger.
I will see you Yeah, I'll see you Oh, I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Winger.
Um So we are having a party?
Annie, you know me better than that.
This is all set dressing.
I'm helping Abed produce his next film.
"Britta's Party, Based On a True Story of Fun and No Rules.
" "Fade in before a party.
People start coming over.
Way more than eight.
It becomes a rager.
Everyone has a great time and parties like there's no tomorrow.
Then they leave.
Sophia cleans up.
The end".
We're very interested in you for the role of Sophia.
I see the stakes of Can't Hardly Wait the subversive raunch of Risky Business and the mumbly pointlessness of everything after 2003.
- But real.
- Totally real.
The first movie to capture the heart of a real party: The sensation that there's no tomorrow.
The transcendence of time.
Bravo, Britta.
Very clever.
Me?
Don't look at me.
I could never green light a project this big.
I moved in third.
I am a coucher.
- She's a coucher.
- I sleep - on a couch!
- On a couch!
She's a coucher!
Look out!
Look out!
Who is it?
It's a coucher!
Oh, boy.
Okay.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Aw.
Before this is over, you'll beg for my forgiveness.
So we have an ultimately low stakes but nonetheless creepy problem with one of our Wi-Felons.
- You mean Willy.
- Yes.
What else did he do?
Steal the driver's ed simulator?
- Did he start an illegal game of solitaire?
- Jeffrey, he's in the room.
Hey, Mr. Winger.
- Why is he on your laptop?
- He came to me for a chat this morning.
He's here for an education, Jeffrey, and he reports to the prison.
Could you do a little more in your class than show Planet Earth?
You're telling on me?
- He tried to murder me last night.
- What?
Now, hold on.
Now, where I'm from, you accuse somebody of something you better have evidence or he better be a minority.
- He tried to push me down stairs.
- That's ridiculous.
It was ridiculous.
This is not someone who should be with students.
And you're seriously taking his word over mine?
Have you ever killed anyone, Jeffrey?
Why would an actual murderer wanna kill a community college teacher?
Now I'm not worth murdering?
- Why would I lie?
- Isn't that your specialty?
You're a raconteur.
You charm people with your slick and fancy words.
Willy, Willy just charms them.
Oh, my God.
Ha, ha.
I should leave you two alone.
I've got classes.
Some of us came here to work.
Jealousy isn't a crime, Jeffrey.
But costing the school $300,000 will be.
So be a good teacher.
Especially when Willy's watching.
- Which is why they call it "yard juice".
- Hm.
- Next question?
- Do you get to pick your number?
Does anyone get their head stuck between the bars?
We call it getting metal ears.
Oh, hi, Mr. Winger.
Thought we'd sneak in a little learning before the movie.
Well, there's no movie today.
- So everyone roll to your seat areas.
- Yes, sir.
So, law.
Law is, simply put, an agreement we all make to do our best to stay out of each other's way.
Is there a more technical definition, Mr. Winger?
Well, I wouldn't know, Willy.
I don't cotton much to fancy words and book study.
- It's not how I got to where I am.
- How did you get to be where you are?
Where were you born?
Mr. Winger was born in dirt, Willy.
Same as you, I'm sure.
And I had my face held down in that dirt by the kings of dirt.
And now they're still there, ruling over dirt and I got out.
By talking.
By lying.
Well, in case you haven't noticed, it seems to beat being a bully.
Garrett?
Mr. Winger, when did you stop being funny?
I mean, am I wrong, or does he seem really intense here?
You're born in the dirt, you'll die in the dirt.
Who are the kings of the dirt?
Everyone's so charmed by him because he's a violent criminal.
But he's also a petty sociopath and the more I try to point that out, the pettier I look.
Weren't you the one who championed this program?
Shouldn't have worn that petard if you didn't want to be hoisted.
What do you think the expression "hoisted by your own petard" is referencing?
I guess I assumed that in the old days, a petard was a special outfit like a leotard, with a lot of fancy buckles and loops on it and that rich people would wear them when they were feeling especially smug.
But then poor people could tie a rope to one of the loops and hoist them up a pole and then let them dangle there as punishment for being cocky.
Never look it up.
Your explanation is way better.
But also the next time a friend comes by with their problems maybe lay off the I-told-you-so's.
Jeff, we're having a Britta party here.
Could you be a little bit less of a buzzkill?
That was great.
Now, party like there's no tomorrow.
- What?
- There's no tomorrow.
Party like it.
Huh.
Uh Okay.
Why don't you just do some business in the background for now?
Hi, everybody.
No, don't worry.
We're not here to bust up your party.
I know most of you are, like, 30.
We're here because Frankie Dart has exciting news.
You have all been very cooperative with this inmate education program.
The department of corrections is very, very happy.
Which means Greendale is gonna be rich.
Whoo!
So don't tell anybody, but we smuggled in a few guests to the party to celebrate with us.
- Did someone order a prison break?
- Whoo!
Plenty of convicts to go around.
Take them to the dance floor.
Pass them around.
That's Willy.
Pass him.
Yeah!
Ha, ha.
Over here.
Pass Willy.
Pass me Willy.
Ha, ha, ha.
- Oh!
Whoo!
- Here you go, Willy.
Keep doing that.
Keep doing that.
Whoo-hoo!
- Try dancing harder.
Ah-ah-ooh-ah.
Is that as hard as you can dance?
You're at a party.
You're celebrating.
- Abed.
It's 6 in the morning.
- Okay, thanks.
Do you think you've gotten enough shots?
Nobody's partied like there's no tomorrow yet.
That's okay.
Are you joking?
This is the reason I signed on.
It's a performance issue.
This needed some real actors.
- Well, lesson learned.
- Yeah.
Okay, from the top and action.
What?
Who are these people?
Go, go, go.
Good, Dean.
Good, Frankie.
Party.
Party.
No tomorrow, guys.
Come on.
Hey, Mr. Winger.
You know, I was thinking for class today maybe you could Hey, what's going on?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, careful now, put me down.
Well, Willy, look at me.
I'm a murderer.
Can I be as cool as you now?
Huh?
!
Willy?
No, no, no!
Willy, talk to me.
Talk to me.
- I can't see anything.
- Willy.
Focus on my voice.
- I'm losing you.
- You're not losing me.
You are going to a better place with a stronger signal.
Willy?
Willy.
Willy!
- What's going on here?
- He started it.
Jeffrey.
You are on sabbatical.
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.
Two weeks paid sabbatical.
Get him out of here.
He's banned from the campus.
You are on sabbatical!
- You're on sabbatical, sir.
- Yeah, I'll go on my own.
With dignity.
- Something you should look up.
- I can't look it up!
You destroyed my device.
And my heart.
You destroyed his device and his heart, sir.
Yeah.
I'm going.
Willy!
Willy!
Sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find a parking spot for my house.
It must be so cool living in a vehicle.
- Wait, where's your poop go?
- A tank.
Gross.
Get a house.
- Ben, aren't you homeless?
- Yeah, but I poop in a house.
- Whose?
- Nice try.
- Annie.
- Britta.
- How's your movie coming?
- Amazing.
Abed's a genius.
Having a hard time deciding what to cut.
It's going to be in two volumes and it's hard to sleep but it's worth it because it's a movie about a party.
- Would you like my help?
- Yes.
Have you learned anything?
Don't question rules.
Rules are good.
I'm bad.
All hail Annie.
- Thank you.
- Damn.
How nice of you to show up.
We moved here for you.
I didn't ask for this.
Have your meeting at school without me.
Dean's using the study room for the ceremony.
- What the Ceremony?
- You don't know?
The dean is making that convict into a professor.
- What?
- Why do you care?
Because the dean is doing this to prove something and it's really stupid.
The guy's dangerous and he's manipulating him.
Isn't that what you usually do?
No.
I mean, yes, but not like that.
I lie to the dean for personal gain.
Wouldn't use him emotionally, I wouldn't mislead him, I wouldn't hurt him.
Have you ever thought of saying that to the dean?
Jeff, go to him.
Going to him.
Wait.
That's the whole point.
I can't go to him.
I can't get on campus.
And yet murderers can.
- What have I done?
- Murderers can get on campus.
I'll need a broom, a remote control car an iPad and an elaborate, gyroscopically-stabilized servomotor.
Dude.
We're trying to help Jeff here.
You're acting kind of spoiled right now.
Party, party, party.
Cut!
Abed.
Britta has something to say.
My script is misleading.
It's impossible to party like there's no tomorrow.
- But it's based on a true - It's based on my desire to have a party.
Parties are just booze, low lights and loud music so people can feel more, see less and not have to listen to each other or themselves.
That's stupid.
Parties are stupid.
I'm stupid.
You're shooting a stupid movie.
- That's a wrap.
- Ugh.
Go on.
We're done here.
Bye.
What's gonna happen to me?
You're going to be punished in ways you won't understand for longer than you'll think is rational or possible.
But then one day, you'll do something he likes and he'll stop.
And eventually you'll either adapt or lose your mind.
Okay.
Girls?
Girls.
As a prison warden, I know all too well how rare stories of true rehabilitation can be.
But this dean and this prisoner stand here together today to prove that the dream is real.
- I'm here for the ceremony.
- Last name?
042098.
Okay, go on.
- Hi.
I'm here for the ceremony.
- Have a nice night, sir.
Dean Craig Pelton, do you accept responsibility for any damage incurred by hiring a felon?
I do.
Willy Sebret Smith, do you accept that the 13th Amendment abolished slavery for everyone but convicts and that we have no choice but to pay you 13 cents per hour or less?
- I do.
- Aw.
Let us make official this symbolic union Hold it.
Dean, I agree there's no reason you shouldn't give this guy my job.
Save it.
I don't wanna hear it.
Don't do it before I tell you some things I've been getting away with not saying.
- Somebody get this maniac out of - Quiet, Willy.
Let's do this by prison rules.
Say what you have to say.
Dean.
I like my job.
I don't mind coming to work here.
I feel kind of guilty when I pretend to be sick.
And I try to steal as little as possible.
Just the basics.
Pens, coffee filters, toilet paper and one time an overhead projector and a roll of carpet.
But I don't lead you on and I never will.
I'm not just a pretty face that murders people and tells you what you wanna hear.
I'm less than that.
I'm a gorgeous face that works for you and considers you a friend.
- Oh, Jeffrey.
- Aw.
Now, to be fair, you guys know Willy's an innocent man, right?
You shut your mouth, warden.
No, it's true.
His appeal is in motion.
There's new DNA evidence.
He's a good fella, wrongfully convicted.
You're not a murderer?
- I can explain.
- Ha, ha!
Oh how the mighty have fallen.
Son of a bitch!
Wait.
Let's do this by community-college rules.
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
- Ha, ha!
- Ugh!
Go, brooms!
Go!
- Bring it on.
- Argh!
- It's so violent.
- You punch like a girl!
Yeah, this is what you got?
Here's what I got.
Come on.
Let's do it.
Ah!
Jeffrey!
- Now who's fallen?
- Hey, Willy.
Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa Whoa!
Thanks, Dean.
Dean.
Dean.
Oh, come on.
No, no.
No.
Stop.
Way to go, Mr. Winger.
Way to go.
Everybody, I am not participating in this.
What the hell kind of school is this?
Okay, thanks for coming on short notice.
- Is everyone here?
- I think so.
It's hard to tell without side cameras.
Wait, why am I moving?
Is my custom background working?
Wait I can't W- A-S-D to move.
It's been the same since the invention of the keyboard.
- Okay, nerd.
- As you've heard the rehabilitation program has been aborted so we lost that money, but we no longer have to build 67 ramps - so we should break even.
Can you all hear that?
There's a kid outside throwing tennis balls against my RV.
Think I'm And your Coffee sho Corporate thieves Was it necessary for us to use these things for this meeting?
There's something wrong with mine.
I'll get a better connection.
It wasn't entirely necessary but the prison is selling these units at a discount so I thought I'd run their offer by the school.
- What are you doing?
Get out.
- Mine's broken.
No, it's not.
There's a janitor on it right now.
- I think Britta's being arrested.
- I have every right to be here.
- scared of you, but I'm not.
All right.
That's it.
Do you know how much windows cost, John McEnroe?
- Get off my lap.
- Stop fighting technology.
I vote yes.
We should get these.
They're cool.
I vote no.
People shouldn't be everywhere at once.
- We need to do our own thing.
- Chang, where are you?
- Doing my own thing.
- Why is there tile behind you?
Please tell me you're not doing the thing I think you're doing.
That's the same tile we have in our bathroom.
- What?
Chang.
- I gotta go.
Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I gotta go too.
- Oh, Jeffrey.
- We're passing on their offer?
- No.
They're just amateurs.
Initiating override protocol.
- All in favor of this purchase?
- Affirmative.
Very well.
Abeds, commence with world domination.
Eradicate.
Eradicate.
Eradicate.
Eradicate.
Eradicate.
Eradicate.
Eradicate.
Eradicate.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Dammit!
Come on.
Oh, Elroy!
Elroy, hey.
- Computer no worky.
- Please don't do that.
- Computer no worky.
- Did you forget your password again?
Pelton, I can't keep track of all the parakeets you had growing up.
This is different.
No matter what I do, I get the same error.
Which one?
You have been owned by Elite Fleet 69.
Our hacks are all up in your systems.
I'm not bothering to pronounce them, but there are a lot of z's being used.
Oh, crap.
What?
Is there another Mask movie coming out?
- The school's been hacked.
- What?
- How can we stop it?
- It's too late, it's happened.
No parlo hablo too late at Greendale Elroy.
There's always something that can be done.
You know I, I wasn't gonna say anything but.
You could cut the hardline at the mainframe.
Hardline.
Mainframe.
To the mainframe!
To the mainframe!
Cut the hardline.
- You were being sarcastic?
- Yeah, but you should look at this.
Cancel your offensive performance.
You know the one we mean.
We have all your information.
If you do not cancel this hateful comedy show, you will taste our power in this way.
- There's a link.
- Don't click it.
Oh, what, the green skull will give me a virus?
My God.
It's the lunch lady's emails.
It's all the lunch lady's emails.
Which lunch lady?
The hot one?
You mean the one who serves the hot food?
Mmm, that's the one.
Please tell me you guys aren't sitting there reading the lunch lady's leaked e-mails.
No one here could ever do that, not even in shifts, it's decades of data.
I'm reading the Greendale Gazette's highlights of the lunch lady's e-mails.
I found a torrent of all the highlights if you don't want to wait for the ads to load.
Abed, that's stealing.
Those ads are there so the Gazette can pay people to go through the lunch lady's email.
Not to get too liberal, but once they're online, does anyone really own the lunch lady's emails?
That's why the future of the internet is branded content.
WazzleDazzle.com has got five Bacardi cocktails inspired by the lunch lady's most embarrassing secrets.
Ooh.
You guys are violating her privacy.
I'm pretty sure the media's doing that, Britta.
We're just reading the news.
The police are here, about our computers being hacked.
Hi, guys.
I see a few familiar faces here.
A few new ones, as well.
No, just gonna keep the cop you've known for five years at arms length?
I get it.
What have you boys been able to figure out?
Don't call us boys.
And it's a unique case, because it's hard to decide what laws are being broken.
Unless you count the lunch lady's sex life.
Thanks, thanks a lot.
Anyway, our city does have a cyber-crime division, but it's well, it's pretty new.
Any leads?
Officer Warburton.
I want McDonald's.
Wants.
McDonald's.
Some of you probably can't see from where you're sitting.
It's literally a child in an adult sized police uniform.
It's cute, but it doesn't help our situation.
So what do we make of the demands?
Well we were able to find out a little more.
This message was posted online and signed, The Hackers.
And we assume it's legit because well, that's just where we're at.
Greendale, cancel the performance of the terrorist comedian Gupta Gupti Gupta, who seeks to spread hatred with his hateful comedy.
You guys booked Gupta Gupti Gupta?
$700.
Oh my God, Dean, he's renowned for his racist act.
How can he be racist?
Listen to his name.
Well, the message says if you don't cancel his performance, what happened to the lunch lady's gonna happen to everyone on the activities committee.
Ha.
We don't have a Oh, God, that's us.
Ha!
So, what do we do?
That's up to the school.
Though I'm just a cop, born in a small town, raised in the heartland, but I say cancel the performance, and give the government the sweeping powers it needs to detect and eliminate people before they turn into hackers.
Think that's all I've got.
How's everything otherwise?
Stoked for avengers, avengers, avengers, avengers?
I hear Marvel got really hands on this time, they really pinned in Joss Whedon creatively, so how can that go wrong?
Okay, see ya.
I guess I'm gonna call a press conference and announce the comedy is cancelled.
Wait hold on.
What's that?
Do your thing, inspire them.
To do what?
To rise to the occasion.
To not let these hackers push us around.
Don't you guys think that we have an obligation here?
The cop says no.
Well the cops say that your car trunk has something to do with 9/11.
They're not philosophers, they're crossing guards with guns.
This is on us as a committee.
The eyes of the world Are within hundreds of miles of this room.
Okay, how about the eyes of something bigger?
Aren't you an atheist?
Don't you hate this government?
Are you even planning on going to see this comic?
Yes, pretty much and of course not, I was planning to protest him.
But I can't believe I'm the one saying this.
For God sakes, we're freaking Americans.
We're talking about freedom of speech, it's the amendment so important it's literally the first one they remembered to add.
For white people.
With penises.
We prefer to be called people without color or vaginas.
Look, I know some things have gotten too simple and other things have gotten too complicated, but we still have a legacy and a job in this country.
We're the colony so high maintenance the British gave up.
We're so obnoxious the French sent us a statue.
Nobody tells us to shut up.
And yes, I know that our wealth is no longer distributed, and yes, our democracy has been hijacked and turned into a puppet show about two fake parties that are controlled by a cartel of monopolies, and yes, if our votes had any real power they'd be illegal.
Britta!
Freedom of speech acknowledged.
Trust us.
Cancel the show and you cancel people.
Might as well bring dinosaurs back.
What?
Let her finish.
Britta, you saw what they did to the lunch lady.
You wanna guess how much better my emails are?
You want me to call a press conference and say, now do me?
No, I'll do it.
Let them leak me.
I'm not letting you do this alone.
Screw it.
I'm in.
Someone has to be the last to stand up, and now that someone isn't me.
I kinda zoned out and assume we're standing to go see Avengers.
These guys are giving hackers a bad name.
And hacker is already such a dumb name.
I'm not an idealist, I'm a pragmatist.
And it's never pragmatic to piss you guys off.
So, fine.
You guys.
This is so inspiring.
I guess, just let me know how it goes.
No matter what happens I'm with you, but don't tell anyone I'm with you.
If you do, I'll deny it, but I'm with you here and now.
Not literally here and now, right now I'm leaving, but I will always have been with you secretly.
Bye.
The performance by Gupta Gupti Gupta will go on as scheduled tomorrow night, and we encourage anyone who believes in freedom to attend Mr. Gupta's performance.
Although, as a woman, and someone with many Jewish and black friends, I will be deeply offended.
I'm petitioning to have Mr. Gupta banned from all campuses across America.
But, one thing at a time.
First, freedom of speech does not just apply to speech you want to hear.
Case in point, am I right?
Definitely get my good side, right here.
Mm.
Oh, I'm being censored!
I'm being censored!
Anyway, there's coffee and scotch in the corner.
Screw the hackers and long live Greendale!
Yeah.
All right, I'll see you guys at sound check in the cafeteria tomorrow.
And there is a good chance that we are going to be targeted, so nobody gets on the internet tonight.
What do we say?
No peeking at the leaking.
Promise, promise, promise?
Okay.
Jeff.
Mm.
Thank you for backing me up, a little.
Well, you turned into the path of least resistance.
Deflect all you want, but you're putting your ass one the line for an ideal.
Well, maybe a fraction of a butt cheek on the line.
It's not like I used that stupid Greendale email for anything but porn subscriptions and improv show mailing lists.
What makes you think it's only your Greendale email they'll be leaking?
Because they hacked Greendale.
Do you have a computer in your office?
Yes.
Do you check your emails on that computer?
Uh-huh.
You look at boobies on it?
One time.
They got it.
They got everything.
It's Vietnam now, baby.
It's Vietnam!
Anyways, like I said, thanks.
Hello.
Hello.
Girls.
Frankie.
Francesca.
Word around school is our emails have been leaked.
Is that so?
Oh, the first you've heard of it?
I guess I heard some rumblings.
Hm, rumblings.
Hm.
Hm.
Hello, Jeff.
Hello, Jeff.
Jeff Winger.
Annie.
Britta.
Frankie.
I hear the hackers leaked our emails.
Yeah.
Something like that.
Should we help set up chairs?
Sure.
Something was wrong with that one.
Bad chair.
Hi, how's everybody doing?
I asked a damn question.
Fine.
Fine.
New look.
I'm glad you like it.
I'd hate to think my wardrobe wasn't passing muster with this group.
So here I am in a brand new outfit with an up-to-the-minute shirt.
Okay.
I'm not usually the best at non-verbal cues, so I have to ask, is it possible that everyone here but me read all of each other's leaked emails?
No.
Absolutely not.
It's possible.
I read it all.
I read all your crap.
I have read everything you guys have ever wrote about me in an email.
And you guys are the worst people in the world.
Screw you guys.
Not cool.
Mean, mean, mean.
Point it at me and I will eat it!
What?
I will bite your little finger off and I will eat it!
Then, let's see you type more descriptions of my Houseguest-era Sinbad wardrobe.
Ah-ha.
That's a direct quote from a really mean email I wrote about him.
So now who's the bad guy?
Okay.
How much of the leak did each of you read?
I have a right to fit in!
Okay, stop it!
Stop it!
Why don't we all just admit that we I'm not admitting it.
Oh, Annie, get over it.
Come on.
You had my blood tested for amphetamines?
You were extra jumpy last spring.
We had to double check to be safe.
I don't think I'm jumpy enough if my friends can steal my blood.
Oh, you gave it to us.
For that human genome project?
We only used half of it for that.
By the way, you're one percent Neanderthal.
Ew.
How can you judge anyone, light switch licker?
Like this, ew.
You guys hear that sound?
That is the sound of the hackers winning.
Our school's out there right now, pawing through our dirty laundry, laughing at us, waiting to see what we're gonna do, waiting to see who wins in the battle between terror and cool.
We got to be cool, man.
We got to be cool.
And set up for a show.
Abed, if you wouldn't mind please checking the sound system.
No problem.
Unless you're too busy telling your girlfriend I don't understand Donnie Darko.
Annie.
I'm cool.
I'll set up the box office.
Oh, or will me opening a box office unfairly influence wagers in your betting pool about my sexual preference?
We saw this one coming, and we are so sorry.
Oh, that cuts it.
The word sorry fills that crater right to the brim, yeah.
Oh, boo hoo.
Your friends are curious about your night life.
We kept it among friends.
You told human resources I was a functional alcoholic.
I am required to file a report on every teacher, and if you throw another tantrum I will revise yours.
To what?
Non-lethal murderer?
Armless javelin thrower?
What in your unqualified, buzzword-bloated, little red school house of a brain is a functional alcoholic?
What in your brain is a chapstick lesbian?
To me, 300 bucks.
Unless you care to refute it.
My sexuality is of zero concern to my job and to everyone here.
I swear, if you people were trapped on a tiger-infested island with no food or water, you would judge every ship that came to save you.
How does the tigers survive without food or water?
Oh, it's not cute, Annie.
And I read your entry in the pool.
Was your goal to win or just be disgusting?
I had to pick last.
Yeah, well, we all read about ourselves in your weirdly long, melodramatic emails to your sister, who you might notice never responds.
Take a hint.
She's dead.
I pretend to write her emails as a journaling device.
You wretched, evasive little gremlin.
Okay, why don't we just call that rock bottom.
Check one, check two.
Check one, check two.
Well, well, well, it looks like Jeff Winger auto-paid his car insurance and Annie's book club has a meeting tomorrow.
Where do you guys find the bad stuff?
Maybe, maybe what we all need to do here is have everyone in the room address and own one thing that they know is out there.
No blame, no shame.
Just an explanation.
I'll start.
Now, I'm sure by now, you've all seen the emails between me and the Patterson family of Herndon, Virginia.
Not me.
No.
I received their first letter as part of a family email chain, Christmas of 2007.
I don't think you owe us.
Although, I, I didn't understand why they'd written me.
I responded politely.
When I realized they had somehow mistaken me for their cousin.
For some reason, I suppose it was loneliness, I simply failed to disabuse them of that notion.
Well, that's I've come to love Barb and George, and Gelson and Roselle.
And even Uncle Paul with all his flaws.
And even though our relationship is based on a lie, for me it's.
One of the realest, I'll ever know.
Mm.
I hope you don't think by explaining that, you're off the hook for the 3D models you've been making of our bodies without our permission.
That's what those photos were for?
I'm making a game about lady time travelers.
Where in your pants?
That's pretty creepy, Elroy.
Oh, you guys are so suave.
You're such gentlemen.
You and Chang have a daily email chain ranking Annie and Britta one and two.
By which you mean, Chang emails me rankings every day and I don't respond.
Except for February 7th, 2013.
Chang, Britta is one, Annie is two.
Jeff, ha, yeah.
Jeff, gross.
And Britta, way to instantly memorize the exact date of your big victory.
Hey, silver and gold, ladies, ain't no losers there.
Okay, I think we're losing sight of what's important.
Says the woman suing her father for $80.
Tell it to your fake family.
Have you made any creepy boob models of Jezel yet?
Jezel is like a daughter to me.
But arguably more like a daughter to her parents.
Didn't you have your own family?
Oh, go write an astronaut.
Oh, did anyone see Jeff's letters?
He writes to astronauts.
Talk about creepy.
They're national heroes!
Yes, they are!
Leave them alone.
Ooh, this I gotta see.
You know, what I don't want to see?
Your exchanges with your life coach about the study group when we were dating.
Oh, and by the way, clearly, not a life coach, and absolutely, just an Italian sociopath you met at a dispensary.
You two dated?
This was a study group?
Yeah, Chang was our teacher.
What?
That's right, and frankly, haven't been well utilized since.
Dear Reid Wiseman, congratulations on your successful return to Earth Ladies.
Video games.
Do you have any more advice?
Dear new ensemble, I love you more than my dad.
What!
This is Gupta Gupti Gupta.
Yeah, hi.
Fine, whatever.
Congratulations.
You guys okay?
To tell you the truth, Gupta Gupti, we've been through a bit of a rough patch.
Yeah, the dean was telling me about it and I've been reading about it.
Hope you were entertained.
To be honest, I'm really grateful.
This is the first school in six months that hasn't canceled, so thanks.
I'm gonna go get ready.
We really did the right thing didn't we?
Yeah.
It doesn't matter what we read in the leaks or what we said to each other tonight.
What matters is that right now here on this campus, the people are in charge.
Not the hackers.
Not the media, not the cops, the people.
Abed, go put on some music.
Elroy, Jeff, put out some more chairs.
Annie get ready to introduce our star.
Chang, go talk to yourself in the corner.
Frankie, let the people in.
Hey.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey, Neil.
Hey.
That's the whole audience?
I I can't do a show for one person.
Well, you kinda have to.
But I'd rather not.
Well, you have to, jackass, because there's more at stake here than what you'd rather do.
Oh, God.
There's a new message from the hackers.
Everyone, quiet down!
Abed, cut the music.
People of Greendale, your activities committee has defied our demands, and the horrible racist comedian is still about to perform.
Yeah, that's right.
We beat you.
If this performance goes on as scheduled, all of your information will be published.
If you do not want this to happen, you will find a way to stop this performance.
Whoa!
Stop, stop, hey!
Sit down, Neil!
You can stop me, but you can't stop the people from stopping this show.
Shhhh.
You hear that?
My God!
It's the people coming to stop the show.
Now what do we do?
We have to stop the people.
Their freedom of speech depends on it.
Frankie, Chang, bar the doors.
Annie, introduce him, quick!
I don't wanna do this.
Listen, you piece of crap, we've been to hell and back for you.
Get up there and do your stupid act for freedom.
Okay, okay.
Ladies and gentlemen, he's performed at colleges and clubs all over.
Gupta Gupti Gupta!
Hey, y'all.
Look, I see there's a lot of Jews in the crowd.
I mean, you know, there isn't, but usually when I do my act, there's more.
But, you know, I have a whole Jew thing.
Do it!
Okay, okay.
Who is this guy?
Stop performing!
Do not stop performing!
Okay, this guy.
Look at him.
It looks like he ate so much.
He's very fat.
Don't do this to me.
Shut up and listen.
I see that you're fat, but are you also black or Jewish?
You know, it's hard to be fat when you're black or Jewish because when you're black, your community steals all your food, so you can't eat as much.
And when you're Jewish, nobody ever buys anything, so you can't eat as much.
You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't.
Oh, dear God.
The bastards did it.
They leaked the entire school's data.
Oh, okay.
So hey, fat guy in the audience.
Have you found anyone else you could love, like another fat person?
Or, are you one of those fat people who will always be alone?
Hey, Leonard, you enjoy my girlfriend in 2009?
As much as she enjoyed your plagiarized poetry.
I will kill you.
Don't act like you care about me.
I've seen all of your cartoons about me.
I am this school's worst nightmare!
I am a. Man, it's like Road Warrior out there, but if petrol were privacy and bad teeth were dirty secrets.
Good news!
Neil's talking to us again.
He says he respects our moral position, but not our execution.
Also, he says he's never talking to us again.
I don't see how we can bounce back from this one.
This one?
Yeah.
If you follow a theme of revealed secrets, the email hack is the third installment of a trilogy that began with Annie losing a pen, in what I've come to call the Golden Age.
I'm guessing the second chapter would be when your best friend vanished on a mysterious boat trip after the older one masturbated himself to death?
Yeah.
If that's one you guys bounced back from, we might be okay.
What's the lesson here?
I always wanna make sure I know what the lesson is.
I'm a completist.
The rest of the school's in shambles, so maybe we're more evolved and forgiving than them.
We already know that, stupid.
I feel more desensitized to jokes about Jews and blacks.
Is that good?
Say what?
We know the pieces of our privacy, freedom of speech, terrorism, and government.
So, the lesson is probably an ironic pairing, like one man's privacy is another man's freedom.
Government is terrorism.
The only free speech is private speech.
A free government terrorizes privacy.
That's all four, bitches.
Terror is terrorized by Terry the terrorist?
Tarry not, for terrorism terrifies.
Government.
Speech.
Government.
We caught the hacker.
This is Ryan, AKA StringCheeseHustler, AKA Fartmitzvah, Skullandboners88, Frozensucked, Captaintitty.
You don't need to know all his names.
He lives across the street from the campus, and he's got something he wants to say.
Don't you?
I'm sorry.
For what?
For guessing your school master password was changeme.
Oops.
How do you sleep at night, Warburton?
You were one of us.
You were free.
No one's free when they're one of anything.
And to answer your question, I sleep alone with one eye open.
That's why I'm not the one in cuffs.
Let's go, Fartmitzvah.
Crime doesn't pay.
Crime doesn't pay.
Crime doesn't pay.
I'm sorry if I used photography to digitally approximate some of your naked bodies.
It's all right.
It is?
No!
Anything?
Same as yesterday.
Big cloud of data raining over a pasture.
All 8 billion sheep keep grazing.
Is that good?
Sure.
The thing you said back there about not being a part of anything.
Is that really how you feel?
It's not a question of how I feel.
I feel like flying.
I don't jump off buildings.
Do you believe in God, Warburton?
You know, there's no rule that says we have to be friends, right?
How about common courtesy?
Familiar with that rule?
The words common and courtesy have opposite values.
Common courtesy is just gibberish, hocus pocus, a spell we cast when hoping to cheat reality.
You're a cynical son of a bitch.
I'll give you that.
You know, my wife, she makes these dream catchers.
Shut the hell up.
How fast can you get us to the mainframe hardline?
Yankee Doodle Dandy!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Next item is Friday's alumni dance.
How's that progressing?
I've e-mailed every former student who's not in prison or jail.
Remember there's a difference.
Our alumni are touchy about that.
- What's the difference?
- You go to jail if a cop doesn't like you.
They can't send you to prison without knowing you're poor.
- Do you believe half your own politics?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I'm still trying to find a good DJ.
By which I mean figure out what makes a DJ good.
Or bad.
Or different from a phone or laptop.
How's the PowerPoint for the city council meeting?
Good question.
When you asked if I knew PowerPoint, I said: "Yes".
But what did I really mean?
These are yeses and nos in a chart.
They appear to be the same, however I think you'll find that within some eggs is the truth.
That should've been a dollar bill.
But I'm no magician.
I'm just a guy that knows PowerPoint.
Okay, pushing that meeting.
In other news, campuses across the country, including this area have been seeing a dramatic rise in guerilla marketing.
Why?
They're amazing.
- It's "guerilla" with a U. - Got it.
Undercover advertisers that blend in with the public while covertly marketing certain products.
They can advertise things without you knowing?
Is that legal?
It sounds like brain-Windexing.
It is legal and mostly harmless.
But I'd like to protect some of our more impressionable students from being unduly influenced.
So if you see anything, let the dean know.
Okay, don't freak out.
Someone just told me that Honda has released some kind of super vehicle called the Honda Fit.
It's a small car with a big personality that can handle anything life throws at you.
Why am I standing here talking about it?
I have to find a Honda dealer.
School is canceled.
The Honda Fit, it's happening.
It's finally happening.
I'm gonna give the school's assets a quick freezie-weezie.
- Is this meeting over?
- I think so.
But sometimes we just hang out and say funny stuff.
- Have fun with that.
- Oh Guys do you feel like Elroy doesn't like us as much as we like him and each other?
He probably doesn't know his role yet.
Is he Black Pierce?
Old Troy?
Or Shirley Without a Giant Purse?
I haven't been entertaining since Troy left.
- Not true.
- You're amazing.
It's not just me.
You've been boring too.
What was so special about this Troy person?
Did he own a rainbow?
Was he the group's pharmacist?
- We don't like to talk about it.
- But you often do.
I'm a problem solver.
Give me information.
I'll handle this.
Troy was very gifted at steel drums.
Steel drums.
Interesting.
Well, this has been a great meeting.
I'm off.
That won't pay off immediately, but it's gonna pay off.
And that, Jeff, is the truth.
Did you lose the egg you put the dollar bill in?
That's how it works?
Britta, remember that guy you were in love with but your love was torn asunder because he was the human incarnation of a certain sandwich franchise?
- Sub?
- Don't say it.
Don't ever say that name without compensation.
I know how much that experience hurt you.
Which is why I'm warning you, I just saw him in the parking lot.
Breathe.
The self-destructive part of you wants to run straight to him.
- We need to be smarter than that, right?
- Right.
Thank you, Annie.
Now, I have one more class, but if you can wait 40 minutes, I will meet you No.
I don't just fling myself into the wild.
The hub of a quality camping experience is a safe and reliable generator.
Uh You know what?
Um, I'll talk to you girls later, all right?
Stay inventive and enthusiastic.
Thank you.
- Britta.
- Sub No, no, no.
That's my sandwich name.
I'm my own man, now.
I'm a free, reliable, quality man named Rick.
- Hi, Rick.
- Unh!
- That's for half of my heart.
- Ah!
- And that's for the other half.
And this is for being the reason there's two halves of my heart.
Can you crouch down?
You're taller than my instructor.
- I'm only a yellow belt.
- No.
It took me this long to gain my freedom.
I never stopped thinking about you.
- You touched me in ways no one has.
- Nice.
- I came back for you.
- You did?
Hey, Rick.
Look what I got.
Ha!
- Ho, ho!
Great, dean.
- Yeah.
He, he.
But, uh, where's your Honda Fit?
Oh, I drive a CR-V.
The Fit combines the efficiency of a subcompact with the versatility to take what life throws at it.
Yeah, that's what you said.
That's me.
Can the CR-V not take what life throws at it?
Yeah, but the CR-V adds durability and storage.
Okay.
That makes sense.
I bet my bank has a grace period.
I'm going to get a CR-V.
Dean, Dean.
- Are you guerilla marketing for Honda?
- Shh!
You're not allowed to know that.
I'm useless to Honda if anyone knows.
Unbelievable.
It's the same story all over again.
I disagree.
I think it's a whole new story.
I have a beard now and an identity.
Selling Hondas is just my job.
And they make great products that I'd wanna sell anyway.
- So can you have a girlfriend?
That's what I thought.
Then see you around.
As a friend.
As a friend, Britta can I at least show you the CR-V's easy fold-down 60/40 split-rear seat?
For 15 minutes.
Then friends for real.
- Great news.
- The steel-drum thing paid off?
We invited Elroy to meet us in the study room for a game night.
- He said yes.
- Yah!
Gonna play Pretty Please Will You Like Us More?
That'll warm him up.
In celebration of Elroy's life peaking The Ears Have it.
The classic game of whose ears you have which ears have it and whether you have those ears.
We're work-shopping new handshakes.
You realize you're just reinforcing his aloofness?
You want someone to like you, don't get to know them.
Sit back, wait for them to notice you're cool.
- Are you 13?
- What's the age on The Ears Have It?
- Seven and up.
- Then I'm 6.
Ugh.
I will say you've become more reliable and durable.
I hope we can do this again.
No, Rick.
I want a normal relationship.
I want to experience brunch in public.
I want a non-financial reason to text my parents.
I wanna tell another person how to dress.
We can have a relationship.
We just have to follow a few rules.
- Rick?
Are you in there?
- You have to hide.
The windows are fogged over.
Are you napping heavily?
- I can't hide forever.
- No, but you can hide in comfort.
There's 35.2 cubic feet of cargo space back here.
Please, Britta?
Damn it.
Ugh.
Ah!
Ha-ha-ha.
Come on, come on, come on.
Ta-da!
Why choose when you can Hond-oose?
Oh, and that blower, that was just an impulse buy.
Wow, dean, you know, one vehicle's enough for one person.
I guess I know that in my head, but I can't shake this fear of losing even one small part of what Honda has to offer.
My God.
You're a Level 7 Susceptible.
- A what?
- Uh, nothing.
Nothing, I Look, Rick, whatever that is, you can tell me.
I'm on board.
Yes.
- Yes, you are.
Heh.
- Heh, oh - Am I found in Africa?
- Yes.
And San Diego and the Bronx.
- A woman?
- Am I large?
- Am I an elephant?
- Yaaahh!
I was thinking dolphin, but I knew they didn't have ears.
Because my dentist has a poster of one on the ceiling - and I recently had a root canal.
Ha-ha-ha!
- I could hear you down the hall.
- We're playing The Ears Have It!
- Chang's ahead.
- With an asterisk.
- I'm cheating.
- You can have my spot.
I should leave.
Whoa, no.
Well, fun hanging out with you, Elroy.
We know you have your choice of friends and we thank you for choosing us.
- Easy choice to make.
See?
Told you.
"Elroy doesn't like us.
What are we gonna do"?
You guys are goofs.
- Yeah, we were silly.
- I got up to make nachos and Elroy said: "That was 'not your' job," and we laughed.
Eh-he.
Then he made them for me.
It was more than wordplay.
It really wasn't my job in his eyes.
I hadn't seen that side of him until now.
He had a great time.
- Till Jeff showed up.
Ha-ha-ha!
- Maybe he just doesn't like Jeff.
Okay, my deal.
Boston rules.
Two up, one down.
Elf ears are wild, joker ears are regular.
Ears go cold once off the head.
Rat ears, an automatic loss.
No peeking, sniffing or grunting.
No asking, "Do I have lobes"?
Chang's ahead.
- With an asterisk.
- It's not true.
It is.
I cheat at everything.
I'm cheating at hide-and-seek right now.
We weren't supposed to leave the rec center.
Okay, let's do this.
Extra cards.
Stupid sink!
Every time!
Mother I hate Ugh!
- Oh.
- No rush.
Hi.
What do you need?
A club soda, please.
How about something to keep it company?
- What do you recommend?
- Well, Scotch and soda is a classic.
This one's okay.
We just got this one in.
It's got a pig on the bottle.
But this one, this one's really good.
It's aged eight years, smoky, from Scotland.
A little pricier, but worth it.
I drink this one when I've got a reason to celebrate.
Well, then I will take that one.
- I've got something to celebrate.
- Yeah?
What's that?
She's good.
What are you doing here?
Britta, this is my boss.
From Honda?
In public, you'll refer to us as "Hilary" from now on.
Continue.
There's a program we can be in where we covertly market as a team.
We can be a couple, in a relationship, in public.
We can walk down the street holding hands.
If I take a job tricking people into buying things they don't want.
Do you enjoy billboards and commercials, Miss Perry?
You mean shill-boards and con-mercials?
No, I don't.
I detest them.
They are unmanned bulldozers, rolling over anything in their path.
What Rick does is surgical.
He finds that part of each life that Honda can improve and gently bathes it in the most helpful information possible.
I don't think you understand how surgery works.
I came in here to get a club soda.
Right now I am drinking probably the best Scotch I've had in years.
Did you trick me?
Am I suffering?
Do you love this man?
- I do.
- Then I pronounce you a highly influential couple.
You may kiss your boyfriend.
- Where'd he go?
- That's not for us to understand.
Well, okay, but he's right there.
- Hi, Todd.
- Hey, guys.
- Mind if we sit with you?
- That'd be great.
I have to say, you guys seem very happy together.
Well, we have our moments.
I'm excited because we're going antiquing this weekend.
I love antiquing.
Everything is so old.
- I like it too.
- You said you hated it.
I hated finding these treasures and not being able to fit them in the car.
- Now I got CR-V.
- CR-V?
Yeah, Rick's new Honda.
He won't shut up about it.
- It's kind of a game changer.
- It's certainly a sex-life changer.
Sorry.
We're being obnoxious.
- So, what have you been up to?
- I don't remember.
- CR-V, you say?
- CR-V.
CR-V.
- You're amazing.
- You're amazing.
Honda's amazing.
- I want you to meet my parents.
- Yes.
Honda.
- Look, Britta's in love.
- Yep.
He must be a very special young man.
I bet they'll be together for a very long time.
- Yeah, you got her pegged, man.
Pegged.
- Oh, ha-ha-ha!
- Oh, hey, Jeff.
- Hey.
Hey.
Here, you can have my seat.
- I was just going to class.
- Before you go.
I know you have every one of Natalie is Freezing's CDs but Abed found some songs by them online that they did for a charity album for homeless skateboarders.
"Plastic Doll Parts," "Wallpaper Chrysalis".
"Weird Blanket".
Ha, ha.
I never heard these.
This is great.
Thanks.
Hey, stay away from that mechanic.
Unless I need a wrench made of licorice.
Oh, man.
I'm sorry.
Inside joke.
I'm like a fart to that guy.
He can't get away fast enough.
What?
No.
I mean, maybe.
What happened at that Ears game that made him like you so much?
Brief moments of human vulnerability.
Not your wheelhouse.
Oh, I'm sure you have detailed files on human vulnerability, Abed.
- Wha?
- Whoa, take a knee, man.
He's right, Jeff.
If you want Elroy to like you, maybe you need to put yourself out there.
You mean bribe him with gifts?
- Like your Natasha Freezes CD?
- Mmmmm - Natalie is Freezing.
- Ugh.
Natalie is Freezing.
Ha!
Natalie is Freezing.
Natalie is Freezing.
Natalie is Freezing.
Natalie is Freezing.
What is this?
I don't know.
I I don't know.
- Honda.
- The power of dreams.
Dean Pelton, I know how susceptible you are to advertising.
Would you say I'm a Level 7 Susceptible?
No.
Because why would I?
Because that's moon-man talk.
You mentioned a new kid earlier who told you about the new Honda Fit.
- Rick.
- Britta's boyfriend?
Yeah.
But he's not No.
He's a good man.
And he wouldn't secretly be working for Honda because when we first met he was secretly working for a completely different company.
Are you?
I don't know how to I have a rule about being constructive, so I can't ask any questions right now.
All the questions I have right now are rhetorical and end with the word "idiot".
Do you know what a rhetorical?
No, of course you don't, you're an idiot.
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry, but you're so stupid.
You have no idea.
You're the only one who has no idea because guess why.
Don't answer that.
You'll get it wrong.
Aw, so dumb.
You're just a dumb little man who tries to destroy this school every minute I am sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Oh!
Oh, it's okay.
I mean, it's not okay, but Shh.
Shh.
Oh, so stupid.
- Ah!
- Oh, shh, shh.
Such a dummy.
We are just so thrilled that you brought a friend.
Thrilled.
And it is "friend," then.
I mean, is that the correct moniker?
- Boyfriend.
- Hello.
- Oh!
- Oh, ha, ha!
This is Well, that's - Yes - This is very exciting.
You could just bowl me over with one of those Sweetheart, what are the, uh?
You remember at the Johnson's cabin?
- Feathers?
- You could bowl me over with a feather.
Well, you have a lovely home.
I love this carpet.
It reminds me of the quality floor mats in my Honda CR-V.
Oh, come on, sweetie.
That's not necessary.
You refer to your floor mats as quality.
I've never heard that level of floor-mat enthusiasm.
Should we be caring more about our floor mats?
I don't think we need to jump to conclusions.
- Let the man finish his story.
- They're floor mats, that's the story.
What's this?
What's that?
There's things all around us.
Would you like to see a movie?
We have one.
What is it, George?
It's It's the The Aviator.
No, no The Avatar.
Uh, no, thank you.
That movie is three hours of puke.
Of course Britta's joking.
We enjoy Avatar very much.
- We do?
- Ha, ha Yes.
It's an immensely popular movie.
Of course, we love it.
- How many alumni have responded?
- Not many.
But current students will show up for the degree raffle.
- How about we put the DJ there?
- You don't need a DJ.
I've been saying that since the invention of shuffle.
I have booked a surprise musical guest this evening.
A little piece of '90s nostalgia you might call Natalie is Freezing.
- Are you out of your damn mind?
- You know this band?
You know damn well I do.
Why do you always?
Are you trying to get me to like you?
- Pfft.
No.
- Good.
Because it ain't working.
You weird, hair-gelled CPR dummy.
- It's pomade.
- Aaaahhh.
As long as I'm up here, does anyone want anything reached?
- Hey.
We're Natalie is Freezing.
- Oh, are you Natalie?
I'm Julie.
The name of the band is Natalie is Freezing.
Why would anyone in the band be Natalie?
We're artists.
Cool.
So our DJ was gonna man the frozen-yogurt machine.
- Is that something you can handle?
- If you do need anything reached I've been practicing.
We like Avatar?
In public, yes.
We like things most people like.
- Our job isn't to alienate people.
- We're on the job with my parents?
With everyone, everywhere, all the time.
- You wanted a relationship.
- A real one.
It's real.
Do you not think Honda makes good products?
Of course I do.
That's never been remotely in question.
- But why does that mean I like Avatar?
- Because you're not a monster.
Because people don't wanna drive what a monster drives.
Stop the Honda, Rick.
Do you hear me?
Use a light press of your foot to engage the highly responsive anti-lock brakes of this incredible vehicle.
Now!
I wanna be with you, the real you.
This is me.
This is what I do.
When I influence people to buy Honda products I feel God's pleasure.
That's from Chariots of Fire.
- I love Chariots of Fire.
- So do I. Also, we have to.
Damn it, Britta.
Oops.
Oh, man.
You people are everywhere.
- I was looking for a place to hide.
- Don't worry.
I'm not gonna bother you.
Okay then.
Give me a gin and tonic.
Your friend, Jeff, booked Natalie is Freezing for the dance.
What?
Tonight?
We gotta go.
Why aren't you excited?
I used to date her.
- Natalie?
- Julie.
Why would the band's name be her name?
She's an artist.
We listened to them together.
You never said anything about this.
She messed me up.
She messed me up pretty good.
- To forgetting.
- Not gonna toast to that.
- Then forget you too.
- Aw, give me a break.
That's the problem.
Everybody's in a rush to protect themselves from each other.
Sure, yes, you gotta defend your castle, but you also gotta What's that thing that castles have?
- Walls?
- Come on.
- A moat?
- It goes over the moat.
Goes over.
Enemy knights?
Cavalry?
Uh, arrows?
- No, come on, stop it.
Goes like this: - Alligators?
- It's one thing.
It's mechanical.
- One mechanical alligator.
Are you screwing with me?
- I don't know you're talking about!
- One mechanical thing!
- It goes over the moat!
It goes like this: - A catapult!
- Aah!
- Oh, Jesus!
What are you doing?
- Britta.
I love you.
- Huh?
I'm gonna quit Honda.
I'll get a job, uh I I don't know.
What do regular people do?
Well, they buy things.
I'll do that.
- For me?
- No, for Honda.
Yes, for you.
Normally I would give you a hard time, but I don't wanna be like this guy.
- You're?
You're coming over?
Okay.
- I'm coming to you.
- That seems like a really hard way - Watch out for this foot.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Hold on to me.
Hold on to me.
- Aah.
- Oh, my God.
- Ha!
Oh Oh, wow.
- Uh, what do we do now?
- Uh, my school's having a dance.
- My favorite band is playing.
- Let's go.
Okay.
A drawbridge.
A drawbridge!
You need a drawbridge.
It's Elroy's favorite band too.
I once hallucinated one of their music videos in his RV.
- That's weird.
- No, the dean can't introduce the band.
He's deciding what vehicles to buy for the Athletic Department.
Yeah, he needs a whole fleet.
That's right, a fleet of vehicles.
He just needs to pick a model of car.
He's in his office.
- Did you hear that?
- I heard it, but we're out of the game.
Not yet.
We can leave on a high.
The dean is a Level 7 Susceptible, Britta.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime feeling.
- You won't believe it.
- I believe it, but I don't need it.
Do you?
I'll just do this one last job, then we'll be free.
Be right back.
Guess I'm a Level 7 Susceptible too.
Why do they assume somebody is named Natalie?
It happens all the time.
Remember when we were in Syracuse?
Ahem.
- Elroy?
- Julie.
You messed me up.
You came after me because I wasn't interested.
You got me interested and I fell hard.
Then you got bored and destroyed me.
And I've been afraid to love anybody for 20 years since.
But not anymore.
- Okay.
- I still love you.
But I'm not gonna keep hurting others just because you hurt me.
- Fine.
- Fine.
That's you.
That's my impression of you.
You jaded hipster a-hole.
I still love your music.
Have a great gig.
Elroy, I'm tired of playing this game.
I like you and I want you to like me.
Huh Okay.
You're a good guy, Jeff Winger.
You and I are gonna be friends.
- Okay, great.
Whatever.
- I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you, I love you, I love you - Pfft.
- Pfft.
Sorry, Britta.
Britta did you know your boyfriend was guerilla marketing for Honda?
I knew he represented something I wanted to buy.
I did good, Frankie.
- Didn't I do good?
- Yes.
Good dean.
Smart dean.
He'll be fine.
- But he can never come back here.
- I understand.
Of course, if you want to come with us Because you are good.
I had nothing to do with it.
The 2015 Honda CR-V sells itself.
That's why it's this year's Motor Trend Sport/Utility of the Year.
Oh, my.
Where did he go?
Thank you.
Thank you.
I know all of you know this next one.
"Pillar of Garbage"!
Whoo!
I think this song is about me.
Or heroin.
Oh, who cares?
So now I ask a question?
- Mom does.
We answer it.
- What am I?
- A rabbit.
- Obviously you can't do that.
You can't ask what you are.
Mom, change your ears.
Okay, sweetie.
You didn't say that before.
- Ask Mom a question about your ears.
- I can't see my ears.
- That's why you're asking.
- What are my ears?
No.
Like, "Am I an animal"?
Well, yes.
You are.
And so are you.
Britta, whatever happened to Rick?
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, okay.
Ships in the night, I guess.
Why would you ask that?
I came here because Rick and I broke up.
I know.
I just thought maybe something had changed.
- While I was sitting here?
- Well, these days, with all the apps Play the game.
All right, which friend of ours collects me?
- Joanne Shoenbuchner.
- I'm elephants.
- Yes.
- How did?
- Am I an animal?
- Oh, not by a long shot.
Oh, ho - Do I work in your office?
- Mom.
Nathan in Accounts Receivable.
Not his first wife, his second, who made cake for Memorial Day.
- Am I Mr. Spock?
Ah!
Ha-ha-ha!
- Yes, you are.
That's it.
- I love this game.
This is fun.
- I know.
Where's?
What?
Ugh!
I think we did something wrong.
I know we did, Deb.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
At 60 percent less fat and 20 percent less price the only thing Kolb Family's Family Pack Ham Packs don't have less of is flavor.
Ham, girl!
Family Pack Ham Packs from Kolb Family Farms - the family that's pleased to meat you.
- Ham, girl!
You don't know his name but you know what he says and you love how he says it.
- Ham, girl.
- Ham, girl.
- Ham, girl!
- Ham, girl!
- Ham, girl!
- Ham, girl!
So who is the man who started it all?
Ben Chang, and we have him here with us today.
- You are the "ham, girl" guy.
- Heh, heh.
Yes, I am the "ham, girl" guy.
How did this happen?
Well, I just kept auditioning, you know, kept working hard.
- And now Spielberg is calling.
- Ha, ha, ha.
Not, uh You know, I don't go by phone calls.
I go by contracts.
But Spielberg is interested in you for the Color Blue in the new Play-Doh movie.
Is that right?
Well, maybe, you know.
Maybe.
But like I always say, you know, life is a roller coaster.
You were a teacher at a community college in Colorado.
Did you, one day in class, say, "Class dismissed.
I'm headed to Hollywood"?
I mean, how did your students react to that?
Well, you know, I haven't spoken to them really.
I, um - There's not much for me back there.
- No friends?
You know, I was kind of a loner.
People made fun of me for it, but I just kept my head down and stayed focused on my work.
Well, they're not making fun of you now, are they?
No, they are not.
Can I get a "ham, girl"?
Ham, girl!
You know, I don't know if that was And there it is, ladies and gentlemen.
From community college to something - a little bit better.
- Turn it off.
Ben Chang is on a rocket ship to eternal validation.
Turn it off.
Thanks so much for being Well, it's been three weeks.
I'm having his car towed.
- Here you go.
- To Chang.
May your success be brief and your colds last months.
- Jeff - Hey.
You get out of Greendale or you get me in your corner.
You don't get both.
- Ham, girl.
- Who would have predicted Chang becoming famous?
I did, remember?
Only I thought it would be for - Eating someone.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Think that Spielberg stuff is happening?
How could that happen?
That would mean the world was insane.
Ham, girl.
Not to be crass, but there is an upside to this financially.
Chang's absence lowers our insurance premiums 6 percent.
There's nothing but upsides to him leaving.
We all just feel a little short-changed.
We invested so much in him when no one else would.
Because we all assumed he was so insane he would die if we kicked him out.
And this whole time it turns out we were holding him back.
We thought he was bedrock but it turns out he was the ceiling of a cavern filled with us.
I've already forgotten his name.
Did you ever really know his name?
Chinese fellow, right?
Whose name was some kind of noise?
Clang?
Blang?
Meringue?
Looks like I'm the only one that's not glad he's gone.
At least I can finally clear some space on my hard drive.
Leonard's been in there but I can stand guard if you want to use the women's room.
No, I was shooting a movie with Chang before he booked "ham, girl".
I haven't heard from him since so I assume the footage is useless.
Did he sign a release form?
I make all my actors sign releases before we do anything.
You never know who is going to The school owns a movie starring the "ham, girl" guy.
Soon to be Spielberg's "ham, girl" guy.
- There's no way to finish it though.
- What have I told you about quitting?
That it's sometimes the only way to survive.
Well, don't forget I said "sometimes".
Yolanda, the mayor's up my ass.
I want justice.
Get him in here!
Is that right?
Should I be angry?
The hero is Police Justice.
I had a former cop help me with dialogue.
- I'm gonna punch you in the heart.
- Cops aren't great with dialogue.
- I don't think police should be heroes.
- Britta, pay your rent.
I'm sorry, Abed.
I need more information.
You know, what's my motivation?
Am I married?
I need more to go on.
- Can we get lunch?
- Okay, cut.
That's all.
Chang found out McRib was back, we lost the rest of the day.
- Great actor, huge McRib problem.
- Hm.
Everybody, this is my friend I told you about.
Maury.
A Hollywood film producer whose doctor ordered him to live in Colorado due to a medical condition.
Tell them.
- My blood nitrogen levels are through - Oh, no, no.
The other thing.
- Oh, right.
If you can cut an 81 -minute movie that arguable stars the "Ham, girl" guy I can guarantee distribution and a fast turnaround deal.
People do it with old footage from recently-famous actors.
Have you seen Vin Diesel in 1996's Happy Pants?
- No.
- Well, neither has Vin Diesel but his roommate from film school saw 500 grand.
I can't just burn up my cop drama.
My only chance at the success I need before I'm allowed to make weird stuff for money.
My American Graffiti.
Elephant Man, Four Rooms - The Robert Rodriguez segment.
- Why does it have to be a police movie?
People don't even like police now.
They like dinosaurs, aliens.
Anything Chris Pratt can join forces with.
I have three minutes of footage and He's clearly a police chief behind a desk in New York.
- Is he?
Or is it Space York?
Or is it a dinosaur desk?
How do I know?
You just have to add CG.
That's what they do with Chris Pratt.
They put him in a regular scene and then they add some gagoos.
I have a few CG models of some gagoos.
I got fired from a mouthwash commercial but I successfully won back the rights to my gingivitis monster.
Also, I don't know if it helps, but when I moved into my RV, I found this.
Now, you notice anything strange?
There's no green three in billiards.
Now, there's a green six and a green 14, but never a green three.
So, what sport is this from?
And why was it in my RV?
Anyway, I can do some CG for the movie.
You'll need a Chris Pratt.
I'll do it if I have to.
I can slouch.
Can't believe you are the ones pitching me this and I'm saying no.
You're not saying no.
I mean, legally I can't force you.
But I can do a morning announcement that'll make everyone hate you forever.
Technically, Abed, you would be robbing the school for half a million dollars by not making this.
- But what movie?
- Have you not been listening?
The movie about the "Ham, girl" guy in his space office, fighting some gagoos led by a Chris Pratt type played by Jeffrey without his shirt.
- It shoots this weekend.
- Yeah.
Okay.
But I get final cut.
It has to be a good movie.
You have to finish that cut by Monday, even if it's bad.
But it has to be good by my standards.
Absolutely, and also if it's terrible, nobody will notice or care.
We're gonna make a good movie?
Definitely, or a bad one.
Probably a bad one.
We're all on the same page.
- Yeah.
- I guess so.
All right.
Guys.
- So let's crap out this piece of crap.
- That attitude concerns me.
I need more information What's my motivation?
I need more to go on.
My name is Chief Starr!
And I'm in the stars!
And I'm the hero.
I deserve better.
You're a very gifted pilot, Chief Starr.
I'm the mayor of Outer Space.
Why are we changing course?
The mayor's up my ass!
Father!
I love him!
What in the space?
Yooba-dooba-dooba.
- We're under attack!
- By whom, GlipGlop?
Okay.
Cut!
- Why are we cutting?
- Felt good to me.
Moving on?
- Just a couple of adjustments.
- You get two.
Move when the ship gets hit.
It looks weird when you stand still.
Britta, it sounds weird when you use good grammar.
- My character can't have good grammar?
- Not in a space battle.
Everything else sounds natural, like I'm a space senator.
Mayor.
I'm matching your dialogue to what I have from Chang.
- What are my lines?
- You don't have any.
- You're the backup Chang.
- But we have Chang's footage.
This shot matches the back of Chang's shot.
Chang is Chief Starr, he's the pilot of a spaceship.
- You're Princess Meridian.
- Brittana.
Jeff is her father, the mayor of Space, and you guys are under attack.
Action.
What in the space?
We're under attack!
Cut.
Where are you guys seeing GlipGlop?
- You said GlipGlop was the tennis ball.
- Garrett's not GlipGlop?
If I was GlipGlop, why would I be holding a tennis ball on a stick?
Why wear a blouse?
It's sci-fi, it doesn't matter.
Please don't say that.
I know you don't mean that.
The tennis ball is GlipGlop and please stumble in the same direction.
Go!
Action!
Bang!
What in space?
Yooba-dooba-dooba.
We're under attack!
Who by?
Who attack?
Me princess.
It's the Sporborfians!
Okay.
I'm ready.
Are you ready?
Are we rolling?
Are we rolling?
We're rolling!
Get to the escape pods.
For real?
You picked that outfit?
- Britta!
I - It's Meridian.
Keep going.
Insane.
And what is your name, Exploitia?
Scorpio Nine.
I'm a pleasure droid.
- No.
I'm an assassin?
- You're both.
Keep going.
She was a pleasure droid, turned into an assassin.
She's my other daughter.
Your sister.
Get to the escape pods.
And then we go.
This way.
Check on Chief Starr, Jeff.
Chief Starr?
What?
- I'll see you in hell.
- What?
Mayor, your ass is grass.
Okay, cut.
- There are some things that we could - Okay, moving on, people!
Okay, moving on!
Next shot, Space Station Faculty Lounge, thank you.
Abed.
We need to move a little faster, I think.
- Can I explain something?
- Wish you'd look at what I was wearing and let that be all the explanation you need about our standards.
You understand sci-fi films aren't improvised over a weekend with a cast and crew that doesn't care?
We care about finishing.
And this has to be finished by Monday so you back into a level of quality from there.
Let me use a metaphor I can understand.
Every day I work out.
- Really?
- Because I'm not an artist like you but this is a kind of canvas.
I work on it with equipment, but I will never really be done.
- Could be if you wanted.
You're - This will never be done.
Chris Pratt's never gonna stop, is he?
He'll always be mocking me.
So I can never stop.
Just like you'll never stop making movies.
But I don't stay on one treadmill my entire life staring at commercials for movies with Chris Pratt.
I take my work into the world.
I "premiere" it.
I share it with the public.
Don't stay in the gym, Abed.
Get this session done, get out there and get your shirt off.
Got it?
Yes?
Yes.
I'm ready.
Let's do this.
I understand you're looking for you friend?
- Yeah.
- I'm Minotaur Man.
- What?
- Friends are hard to come by in space.
You'd better take this for protection.
The sound you hear coming from that gun I gave you is 40,000 hyper-watts of laser.
Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, don't worry about that.
I can put that back.
Sometimes my eye falls off because I'm a robot.
- Ah!
- Watch out!
Ah!
How about this bar?
Everyone here is so accustomed to violence.
Ha, ha.
I need I need to know - Where your friends are?
- Yeah.
You're not gonna like this.
Your friends have been taken prisoner by Master Master Dracula.
Wild west, baby.
Space version of the wild west.
Ha, ha, ha.
Cut.
Okay.
My eye fell off.
But I I covered.
Unh.
Unh.
- Perfect.
Moving on.
Hallway.
- Yes!
Take that!
This is crazy.
Here, let me do this.
What are you doing?
You make everything harder for all women when you do that.
I'm improvising.
Improvise pockets!
Pay your rent or shut up!
Laser bomb!
Yooba-dooba-dooba!
GlipGlop like.
Yooba-dooba-dooba.
Yooba-dooba-dooba.
Yooba-dooba-dooba.
So the robot also says, "Yooba-dooba"?
I'm not complaining, it's just that everyone who's not a person is saying: - "Yooba-dooba" - Maybe it's because I'm a spy.
He's a spy!
I'm an evil spy.
GlipGlop is a spy!
GlipGlop's a spy?
We went with it.
Okay, shot, shot.
Okay, now that Now that he's dead and there's one robot left, let's go through the thing.
Go.
Yooba-dooba-dooba.
Yooba-dooba-dooba.
Yooba-dooba-dooba.
Whoa!
Ah!
Space garbage.
- Look!
- Ah!
We're gonna get crushed.
And is there a monster?
- Eeh!
- Ah!
But so what?
We're gonna get crushed.
- Uh I love you?
- I love you.
That's your daughter.
- You're my daughter.
- You said we were sisters, dumb-ass.
That's hot.
It's like Chinatown in space.
- And I'm the hero?
- Yay!
- Let's do this.
- Yeah!
Ha, ha, ha.
They're saved!
Ha, ha.
I feel the force.
What?
I don't feel the force, I'm not allowed to.
What do I feel?
I feel Dracula force.
I feel Dracula signals.
Your ass is mine.
That last stunt you pulled put six of my best guys in the hospital, maniac.
I'm more than a maniac.
I'm Dracula.
Jesus Chr Jesus Christ.
Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ, they shot him.
Who am I?
What's my motivation?
Why am I doing or saying anything I'm saying or doing?
I need more I need more than what I'm getting.
Oh!
It's incredible.
It's incredible.
Congratulations.
- How long is it?
- Eighty-seven minutes.
Get it to 8-1.
That means 81.
I'll make some calls, we'll premiere this thing - and we'll get your school a check.
- Oh.
- So which six minutes should we cut?
- Oh.
Jeff"s death scene probably, right?
Yeah.
- Mine?
- Yeah, in the space dungeon?
- There's no Chang in that.
- How long is Jeff"s death scene?
Yeah, how long is it?
We're really zeroing in on it.
Do you think I'm frightened?
These chains were forged from the iron of Ganymede.
I'm not gonna tell you where he is.
I'd rather die.
Hm.
Seems pretty important he doesn't give up Chang.
Otherwise the last thing he says to him is, "I'll see you in hell".
- Uh - It's not really a movie about him.
- Yeah.
- Well, what about your steel drum solo?
I don't think we should lose that.
What about the weird wedding ritual on GlipGlop's planet, huh?
Um, okay, let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater.
- We're not cutting a frame of GlipGlop.
That's like cutting Cowboy out of Midnight Cowboy.
Jeff"s death scene is six minutes, 30 seconds.
- There you go.
- Okay, cool.
Easy enough.
Um, should we?
Before we finish editing should we get those hornets out of the garbage?
The swarming hornets?
- Is that serious?
- Is he doing a bit?
That's a long bit.
Oh, he's serious.
I mean, let's face it.
It's pretty obvious when he's acting.
Let's do this.
Yo, yo, yo, howdy.
Welcome to Kyle Beiderman's editing tutorials.
I'm Kyle Beiderman.
Yeah, that Kyle Beiderman.
Leave me alone, Abed.
Once I watch this tutorial on how editing works I'm gonna save this movie without removing its soul.
Step one, how to correctly label your files.
No, no.
Who cares about labeling files?
Teach me to edit.
What the hell was that?
- You stay away.
This is my movie too.
- Not even a movie.
It's a piece of crap.
- Doesn't mean it can't be good.
- It's basically what it means.
You stay away, Abed.
I'm not kidding.
I'm huge and I have zero blood sugar.
I will kill you in these Frisbees and nobody will ever find you.
Okay, so now let's get familiar with the user interface.
No!
Just teach me to edit!
- Boing-tanga!
- Argh!
I'm going to kill you!
- You're killing me.
- I told you.
You're literally killing me.
- For real?
- Yes.
Are you nuts?
What is wrong with you?
Every single one of you is gonna leave here except for me.
Troy, Shirley.
Annie's gonna be president.
Even Pierce got to die.
Now Chang goes to Hollywood so we force you to make the crappiest movie of all time then force you to make it crappier.
We watch it, it's not even bad.
The part I accidentally got most excited about is the seven minutes we can cut.
- You know what that means?
- I'm a genius.
We knew that.
I finally know in my heart that I will literally be the last one of us here.
And I know they gave digital muscles to Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy.
I watched Parks and Rec.
- There's no scientific explanation for - Jeff.
You helped me learn something about filmmaking we need to apply to life.
It's okay to plan stuff, figure out what we did wrong.
Plans are randomly gonna fall apart, lessons are randomly gonna be wrong.
If we keep the cameras rolling and shoot a lot of crap eventually Annie is going to reach down her shirt and pull out a laser bomb.
I didn't write that.
We didn't plan that.
God made that happen.
God made this movie and it's dumb.
And we're dumb for being in it.
Life is a big, dumb, pointless movie with no story and an abrupt ending where the hero gets shot by Dracula in the middle of a lunch order during an outtake but somewhere, every once in a while Annie reaches down her shirt.
So we keep the cameras rolling.
We edit out the parts we don't like and we stop thinking about Chris Pratt so much because it is not healthy.
Will you do me a favor?
I never tell anybody about our private conversations.
Let's cut my stupid scene out of this of crap.
- And won't we need to add 30 seconds?
- I have an idea about that.
Who am I?
What's my motivation?
Why am I doing or saying anything I'm saying or doing.
I need more I need more than what I'm getting.
Aw.
Hello, Chief Starr.
I told you I'd see you in hell.
- And look who else is here.
- Yooba-dooba-dooba!
- Yeah!
- Yeah, Abed!
Yow!
Ha, ha, ha.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Oh, great job, you guys, on the new ending.
And I like that the guy actually saw him in hell.
Right?
Hold on, phone call from the distributor.
Get ready for a big check.
Hello?
Wait.
Calm down.
What's Chapter 11?
Wait What's YouTube?
Wait, what's broadband?
- What's digital?
- I don't have a good feeling about that.
I don't have a good feeling about Chang staying bankable.
Did you see this news story?
I'll never look at a hot air balloon in the same way again.
- Or James Franco's ball.
- Ugh.
No.
I'll tell you what I do have Bring it in.
- Aw.
- Come here, guys.
- Guys, we do the thing.
- We did it.
Yooba-dooba-dooba!
Yooba-dooba!
All right.
One more for safety, Ben.
What do you mean?
I just don't know if we got the line, "Hold on, Slinky".
Let's move on.
I think Can?
Can we get one more?
You got it.
Come on.
Hold on, Slinky.
Let's go.
I think it was fine, but Steven's kind of a stickler.
Tell Steven Spielberg to lick my butt.
Well, he's right here, so Hey, Steven.
Spielberg.
Can you give us a sec?
Yes.
- Ben?
- Yup?
So I I guess we're good for today.
Great job.
You were right.
We got everything we need and there's a small door in the back.
Back of the booth there, that will take you, you know, outside and we'll talk soon.
- I don't go the way I came?
- You do not.
There's a little door back there and it goes right on out.
Thank you so much.
Okay.
Okay.
- Okay, Randall, are you ready?
- Yep.
Which brings us to the issue of our cosmetology department who, once again, find themselves Who once again find themselves nearing the end of the semester without any free haircut volunteers.
That may be due to last semester's lice scare.
Totally.
Yep.
"Guaranteed No Lice".
- Something like that.
- That would open you up to lawsuits.
"Son, we live in a world that has walls and those walls have to be guarded by men with hair clippers".
- Pink Floyd.
- Ugh.
- You're the worst.
- What?
- Oh, she is the worst.
- Terrible.
- I can't believe she said that.
- Have you seen any movie?
Name one.
- It's an unrelated thought - Britta's the worst!
- Seriously, what happened to you?
- I don't know.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
You haven't looked at the new courses.
I'm like a kid in a candy store.
Candy lost its appeal now that I work at the store.
Becoming a teacher here gave me diabetes.
I was just saying that.
Are you always thirsty, fatigued and have blurry vision and your cuts heal slower?
- Those are actual diabetes symptoms.
- That's what the doctor said.
So is he treating it?
- I asked him the same thing.
- What did he say?
"Make an appointment through his office during business hours.
This is his home.
His children sleep here".
You know doctors.
Oh, my gosh, you guys.
There's a class called Basic Grifting.
Should we all learn how to be grifters together?
- Wait, what do grifters do again?
- I got this.
- I'll tell you for 5 bucks.
- No.
- You better sign me up.
- I've wanted to learn grifting since I saw The Grifters featuring John Cusack, Anjelica Huston and almost no grifting.
- Don't take a grifting class.
You're gonna get grifted.
More so than by that oceanography class.
Only none of you will get a goldfish.
- Then you'll come back to me.
- Why you?
Let's face it, I'm the closest thing that Greendale has to an experienced grifter.
Oh, this is one of those things where Jeff gets jealous of something dumb.
Jeff"s jealous of a grifter.
Ha-ha-ha.
Because he wishes he was still a grifter.
That's something I can mock, and I live in an RV.
My table folds down from the wall.
I say we take the grifting class together have a great time and rub it in Jeff"s face.
Who's in and can you cover me?
I'll pay you back.
- I'll get it from your parents.
- I'll pay you back.
- And I'll pay back your parents.
- Which will be never.
I'll get a high-five from your parents.
Each student should bring a briefcase.
I don't have a briefcase.
We're gonna grift with briefcases?
Basic, my ass.
That's advanced.
- I have a few extra briefcases.
- Shocker.
We each need a regulation grifting briefcase.
- It's a grift.
- What's a regulation briefcase?
I don't know, but they're provided for only $150.
You're being grifted.
Shut up, Jeff.
You're such a negative person.
What do you contribute to this group besides negativity?
Guys, watch this.
- Can I borrow $150?
- No.
See?
Now, who's gonna come with me and show this guy what's up?
- I'll pay you back.
- I'll get it from your parents.
Tell them I spit on their wealth, and thank you.
Good morning.
My name is Professor Roger DeSalvo, for the time being.
For I use many a pseudonym.
Such as Jeff Goulash, Phillip Switch or Baz Ravish.
For I am a grifter and this is Grifting 101.
Now, which one of you thinks I did that on purpose?
Exactly, you think you've seen me fail.
You think you've spotted a weakness.
Let me tell you something.
With the flick of a wrist I could show you a fool one minute or longer.
I see you've got your briefcases.
Excellent.
Hold them aloft.
Pass them to each other.
Now pass them back.
Do it at speed.
Quicker.
Pass them like hell.
Pass them like your sister's dying.
And continue that for about 40 minutes.
Wait.
Forty minutes?
- What's your name, my love?
- Annie Edison.
Sounds like a real name, not the name of a grifter and therefore, not a teacher.
- Ahem.
- What?
My name is Slick Pockets Tucker.
- No, it's not.
- Correct.
What will the next lesson be?
The next lesson will be passing two briefcases.
You need to master the art of passing one then you can purchase another briefcase.
- What?
- You talk too much.
Keep passing.
It's a very funny book.
Oh, no.
Grifters.
I better watch my french fries, unless Counterfeit?
Where'd you learn to do that?
- We didn't learn anything.
The class is - A rip-off?
What's another word for that?
- All he did was make us pass briefcases.
- He kept trying to sell us stuff.
Briefcase-swapping talcum for grifter's palm.
Oil for silent switcheroos.
Something called extra believable socks.
Those are actually half off.
I kind of feel like I grifted him.
So, in a sense, what happened is you took a class about grifting and?
Jeff, you really need us to say it?
- You were - Whoa.
Yeah.
I need you to say it.
Let me just get settled.
Ah.
Okay, go.
- You were right.
- Oh, aah.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you live and you learn, guys.
Well, you live, anyway.
- So now will you please help us?
- Help you?
- We want revenge.
- We wanna grift him back.
Grift a grifter?
That's as dumb as taking his class.
- Cut your losses.
- Jeff I begged you not to go down this path, and you made fun of me.
- You pointed at my face and laughed.
- We're sorry.
My feelings are fine.
I'm just very lazy, and you gave me an excuse to do nothing.
- I'm not just gonna throw that away.
- He's even lazier than you.
Doesn't your species consider that a challenge?
Shouldn't you be having some reverse pissing contest to determine who's laziest?
Wait, is that where you suck it back up in your?
Sorry.
I've only ever done it the other way.
You mean peeing?
No, I mean in the back.
He hasn't done anything to me.
In fact, he sounds like a pretty good guy.
I bet we'd get along.
Good show.
Good show.
What show?
I haven't seen that show.
All right, all the best.
And you are?
Well, I was the guy with a full bottle of Scotch and a high tolerance for foreigners.
- Ha-ha-ha.
How robust.
I imagine that you're Jeff Winger.
Turns out we're going to be office buddies.
Hello there, sir.
My name is Roger DeSalvo.
Or is it?
You see, I happen to be in the Grifting 101.
Yes, I've heard about you.
That would be your desk.
If you need a mnemonic device it's the one without someone's stuff all over it.
Well played.
Very well played.
I gotta say I admire your style.
Grifting people by selling them grifting lessons?
It's genius.
- But I call - I never said my class was a grift.
Don't worry about me.
I'm one of you.
Was, anyway.
Do tell.
Well, I worked in one of the top law firms in the city as a lawyer.
But guess what.
I'm not a lawyer.
Heh.
No, I think you're talking about lying.
- Grifting happens to be an art form.
- The art of lying.
Let's not get high-handed.
Grifting is lying.
Okay, so like a string is a sweater.
Like paint is the Sistine Chapel.
Sure, grifting includes lying, but only a liar would call grifting lying.
And only a delusional hobo would glorify stealing.
Did you say something that wasn't true?
- Maybe we should phone the museum.
- I was on your side.
You're an ass.
Well, you're a craftless, artless thug.
And I'm God's paintbrush.
No, I am God.
Which pretty much makes me better than you.
You know what?
Let's agree to disagree.
It's not important.
Oh, okay, so you can lie.
Yeah?
You liar.
Yeah.
I wanna speak to you, you son of a bitch.
What?
I love you.
Oh.
I do too.
Good.
Why are you guys still doing that?
Well, it was homework.
And we're getting better, right?
Or the friction has melted the handle to fit into our palms.
There's nothing to get better at.
The class is a grift.
The next person that says "grift" is gonna grift.
My God, now it's replacing other words.
All right, I'm in.
Let's grift the son of a bitch.
Why are you cheering?
He could be saying anything.
Grift, grift, grift.
Grift, grift, grift.
Good work.
I can't remember your name.
Likewise, no idea what your name is.
Great job.
All right.
I'd say you're pretty close to swapping with briefcases Ioaded with actual fake money, such as this.
This isn't real money.
It's just cut-up newspaper, but it weighs the same.
Costs $5 apiece.
You'll be using 10.
- Telegram for Elroy Patashnik.
- I'm Patashnik.
Telegram, sir.
Oh, my God.
My Aunt Baba died on vacation while in Africa.
She left me a million dollars.
The African government wants to seize the funds.
Class dismissed.
Not you.
Are you out of your mind?
- What?
- The African Telegram.
The Jim Belushi of grifts.
Are you trying to grift me?
- I'll cut you in for 14 grand.
- Get out.
Out.
One more thing.
- Nice try twice.
- Twice?
The fake grift within the grift.
The double bean, if you like.
I'm gonna mention a name and however you react, I'll know the truth.
Jeff Winger.
- That's the one.
What?
Who?
- Who?
Jeff Winger?
That's the one.
Out you go.
Say hi to him.
By the way, Jeff Winger.
Nice try thrice.
Hey.
How was grifting class?
Did you teach advanced grifting techniques only you could understand?
The Brown Betty?
The Texas Well Baby?
The Reverse Jim Gaffigan?
Well, I wouldn't teach the African Telegram since I'm not a hack, and also since the Internet.
Okay, you caught me.
Game over.
- Let's end this competition.
- Cheers to that.
Uh Sir?
You That guy left his lottery ticket on the table.
That was the telegram man.
- No, it wasn't.
I mean, what telegram?
- Exactly.
What telegram?
Because the Internet.
You know, that place you obviously went to, to type in the word "grifting".
I'm gonna grift you.
I'm gonna grift your ass.
Or is that the grift?
None of it's a grift.
It's all nonsense.
Okay, how many times have I told you people the faculty lounge is not a bar?
All right, pack it up, people.
Come on.
You don't have to go teach a class, but you can't stay here.
Look.
Truce.
Okay?
Promise no more grifting and promise, if this is worth a million, we'll split it.
You're an idiot.
- Or maybe I'm a genius.
- I can answer that.
- You're an idiot.
- Can an idiot walk backwards like this and not hit anything?
- Maybe.
Or maybe not.
What?
What are you doing here?
This guy is a grifter.
Professor of grifting.
He charges $400, you get two briefcases and your ex-boyfriend becomes an obsessive I didn't know you and Winger were lovers.
If he wanted my respect he should've opened with that.
- Are you trying to be disarming?
- Are you grifting me out of my arms?
- I did nothing.
He called himself a grifter.
I corrected him.
Yeah, because the truth is so important to the both of you.
So, what's it gonna cost to make you go away?
- Ahem.
- Well?
He took the bait.
- Yes.
- Yes.
I thought we didn't want him to take the bait.
We're saying the same thing.
He didn't take the bait we didn't want taken.
- The African Telegram.
- Yeah, which was offered as fake bait and taken as such, i.e., not taken.
- Because that made him feel in control.
- And by avoiding all visible bait he placed himself on the hook of assuming we're planning to grift him.
- I like it.
- Yeah.
But we are.
So he knows the truth.
Isn't that the one thing you're not supposed to know when you're being grifted?
Hmm.
He can know a plan all he wants.
But the plan he knows won't be our plan.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Because our plan is impossible to know?
Because Oh, my God.
Jeff is making this up as we go.
Shh!
Just knock it off.
What do you want from me?
- We wanted you to help us do a grift.
- I'm working on it.
- Improvisationally?
- They had a plan in The Sting.
If anyone wants to watch it, it knocks out half a day.
Look, do you guys remember when we hugged and jumped up and down in the cafeteria?
Obviously.
Having been together virtually nonstop ever since at what point do you think I slipped off and planned an entire grift then withheld it from you?
At any of the several dozen points when a normal person would say: "By the way, I have no plan".
In The Sting, they withhold stuff from each other.
Or from the audience, for effect.
Also, - Why don't you marry The Sting?
- Lf we have half-Sting children when they ask how to grift, I'll tell them to watch their mother.
Not you.
You are unbelievable.
- Bad stinger.
- Shut up, okay?
You guys, you're You're always picking on me, all right?
You've really been hammering me lately.
All I had was the idea that Look, I I need this.
I need to be better than this guy.
Let me think.
- Abed.
- Yeah.
- Did you bring your laptop?
- Right here.
What do you wanna do with it?
Watch The Sting.
It's over.
What happened?
Who got shot?
Ahem.
What's going on?
Was Sting even in it?
- That was terrible.
- You slept the whole time.
The dialogue seeped in my dreams.
- My whole brain is long and quiet.
- So how did they grift him?
Well, they basically made a fake building and hired a thousand people to cooperate in perfect secrecy.
Hmm.
- Should we just do that?
- We could watch another grifter movie.
- More activity in Matchstick Men.
- Like what?
- At one point, they build a fake hospital.
- So much construction.
Oh, God.
It's so late.
- You're gonna bail on me, aren't you?
- I think we have to, Jeff.
We've tried everything we can.
Maybe over the weekend, I can make a fake building.
But all the briefcases and the swapping and The Sting?
I'm not cut out for it.
I think real grifts only happen in movies.
- Even then, they barely make sense.
- Look, I'm old.
The Sting is terrible.
Grifting is stupid.
The writing's on the wall.
- So that's it.
- There's no shame in this, Jeff.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Well, this is a scene to behold.
Huddled in the closet, watching The Sting like gypsies.
Roger.
We surrender.
You were right.
I'm no grifter.
No, I was wrong.
If you remember, I called you a thug.
Thugs fight.
You're more No, I can't think of a metaphor pathetic enough to suit you, Jeff Winger.
I'm reminded of something Oscar Wilde once said when he compared sheep to wolves.
Screw it.
Britta.
You hit me.
With a woman's hand.
You Midwestern floozy.
I lived in New York.
Aah!
Yeah, right, he's grifting us.
Ugh.
Grift blood.
Someone taste it.
I'm sure it's karo syrup and food dye.
I mean, I would, but my diabetes.
- 19, 20, 21.
Are you counting the amount of money or the number of stacks?
Um - I have to start over.
- I'll do it.
Move.
But I want to go on record as being disgusted by this transaction.
Got it.
Disgusted.
I'm sorry, love, but would you rather we took this to court?
No, no, no.
We appreciate you keeping this between us.
I wanna remind you we offer a lot of classes and many of them are cash-only.
Me, take a class here?
Talk about a rip-off.
Ha-ha.
Oof.
Talk about a ribbing.
Ha-ha.
What the hell am I doing?
You know, so far, Frankie's disgusted and that's it.
Seems like a waste of a record.
- I'm so sorry, guys.
This is all my fault.
- Don't be.
I'm the one who got into a pissing match.
- With a jerk.
- You're a jerk.
- You're a jerk.
- You're a jerk.
You're all jerks.
And this whole school can suck a big one.
And you can put that in your record.
I'm sorry, guys.
I'm bound by my station.
Speaking on that topic.
Britta.
This is all your fault and you're expelled.
- No, dean - Let Let me handle this.
Pelton, you can't do that.
Britta's the heart of this group.
She started it.
As a As a fake biology group so that she could have sex with Troy.
- No, no, no.
- That's exactly it.
Okay.
Don't let me handle it.
- No.
- You can't expel Britta.
She's been here six years.
Three more and she'll have her two-year degree.
Britta keeps me grounded in reality.
You can't expel her with four week-isodes left in a seaso-mester.
- It's starting.
- It's okay, guys.
It's okay.
All right.
Fifty thousand.
And I'll just put this in here.
Mm, mm.
- Give it to me.
- Yep.
Don't help me anyone.
Oh.
- Turn me around.
- Ugh.
Come on, you guys.
I'll see you later.
Hey.
The plan was to meet later.
So, what's it gonna cost to make you go away?
There's a way we could end this very quickly and make a bit of money.
I don't like it.
But keep talking.
Yes, that was the plan.
And your plan was probably to never show up.
Clever girl.
Don't trust anyone.
Hang on.
Did you have to hit me for real?
Have to?
No.
Mm.
Now that you're expelled you might consider a career in grifting.
- You're quite good at it.
- I don't know.
How does one go through life like that?
Well follow me and I'll show you.
- Oh, shut up.
I only agreed to any of this to get you away from Greendale and out of Jeff"s hair.
He's an idiot, but I hate watching him spin out trying to beat you.
- Oh, you sentimental fool.
- No.
Later.
At the motel.
The motel.
Hmm.
I am the king.
No.
What the hell?
Oh, shut up.
The only reason I agreed to any of this was to get you away from Greendale and out of Jeff"s hair.
What the?
You two.
Come back here.
Briefcases.
Coming right through.
Identical briefcases.
What?
Why more briefcases?
This is pointless.
I already know she's got my briefcase.
Briefcase parade.
Who the hell are you?
You get back here.
You get back here with my money.
Get back here.
- Oh, Roger.
- They stole my money.
- What?
- What?
Those briefcases contain my money.
They stole $50,000 from me.
Fifty grand, huh?
- You know what he's talking about?
- Don't think so.
These are our briefcases.
We're in his class.
He sells these supplies, 150 bucks.
- Really, a hun?
Okay.
- We are still rolling.
We got pretty good at it too.
Check it out.
Ow.
- Ow.
Sorry.
I got it.
- Sorry.
Okay.
Roger, why were you walking around with $50,000?
- Are you mental?
- Hey.
Whoa, pal.
That usage may fly in the UK, not in the States.
I have a mentally challenged cousin.
- Sister.
- Pics.
- I wanna see pics.
- Me too.
You know very well that this school paid me $50,000 in cash for these injuries.
You seem to be in pretty good shape now.
Oh, my God.
Look at the two of you.
Yeah, he's the reason I became a cop.
You know, a lot of bullies out there.
There are a million witnesses to this.
- Hey, everyone.
- Hey, guys.
Hanging out in the cafeteria?
Hi, professor Oh, what happened to your face?
This is ridiculous.
Oh, she's beautiful.
You could be twins.
So the statement I'm hearing here is you're a grifting professor.
- Yeah.
- Teaching these people how to grift but you're saying they grifted you?
No, you id I'm not saying that.
They didn't grift me.
What they do is not grifting.
They wouldn't even understand the word.
I think we need to take what Roger's saying more seriously.
Because it sounds like he was either the victim of crass, artless thuggery.
- Correct.
- In which case there really is $50,000 floating around that he was given for clearly fake injuries and that he, therefore, now owes the school.
- What?
- Or Professor DeSalvo was targeted by a group of people he vastly underestimated.
In which case, the money was given and then taken back and nobody owes anybody anything.
All he would have to do is admit.
I was grifted.
- Yeah!
- Grift, grift, grift.
Grift, grift, grift.
Why are you even here?
Who called you?
Nobody.
I take macramÃ© after work.
They know that.
Sorry you got grifted.
Let me know if you wanna press charges and if you can think of what those would be.
Professor DeSalvo, under the circumstances I'm sure you agree it doesn't make sense for you to keep teaching here.
Yeah, I mean, we kind of know everything there is to know.
You should refund all of their money.
And we should all go get some hot dogs!
Hot dogs!
Hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs.
Hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs.
Hot dogs Wait.
We were all in on it the whole time?
You weren't.
- Because I can't be trusted.
- Aah!
Hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs.
- Telegram for Mr. Winger.
- Ridley.
- I returned the telegram man outfit.
- Thank you so much.
I know how crazy this week's been.
You really didn't have to do this.
Are you kidding?
I owe you.
- Whatever you need, say the word.
- All right.
I could use your help moving a mattress this weekend.
Okay, cool.
- Is that okay?
- Let me know.
My name is Ryan Ridley.
Three years ago my life was saved by a stranger at my gym.
I felt like I owed him my life.
Apparently, he agreed.
Now he has me do things.
And I keep hoping and praying that one day I'll do enough for him to call us even.
Until then, I'm just a guy from his gym.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Three weeks earlier.
Huh?
You know how sometimes a movie or a show begins on a random, intriguing scene with no context given encouraging you to wonder whoa, how'd this crazy scenario come to be?
And then it cuts to black and a title comes up and says three weeks earlier.
Huh.
Here we are.
Sitting in silence, crammed into an RV.
Winding through the mountain roads of Colorado with a 19 foot fiberglass hand tied to the roof.
If there was ever a time to cut to three weeks earlier it'd be right now.
Know what I mean?
Elroy you got any booze?
Don't go through my stuff!
This isn't a bus.
You're standing in my living room, kitchen, and bedroom.
Ooh I never thought about that.
And your backyard is 24,900 miles long, because it's the circumference of the Earth.
Because you have no home.
Did anyone need water?
What else can we talk about?
I guess to make it really intriguing, one of us should be visibly injured in a way that makes you wonder how it happened Like if Britta had a black eye.
Dean, can I speak to you privately?
I'm pretty sure the answer is no.
Coming up.
You know, when I agreed to hold this thing for you and the school, you didn't say anything about six people sitting back there.
Man, I wonder what they're talking about.
God!
Who knows?
They're sealed off behind this soundproof vinyl.
I will drive my house off a cliff.
Elroy, we're not here to snoop or judge you.
You're not the first person to have dirty dishes, CD rom porn and framed photos of yourself with two biracial teenagers in a park.
It's not that.
All of this weight.
I may have miscalculated the mileage.
Darn it, I wanna hijack this RV, but I'm foiled by its impenetrable post-2001 security measures.
You keep driving and nobody else needs to know about this, understand?
The last thing we need is a panic.
What's going on?
Are we out of gas?
Yes!
It's on empty!
It's on empty!
Like, the needle is invisible.
Oh, my God!
There's no needle.
It's gone.
It's underneath the plastic or maybe the engine tried to use it as the fuel.
Oh, stop yelling.
Well, stop being out of gas.
You're freaking me out.
You should be freaking out.
I have been driving for 25 years, and I have never seen so little gas in my life.
Aah!
Stop, stop, I'm yelling even louder so you have to stop.
We're not in control of the gas, okay?
We have to focus on what we can control.
Is everyone's phone charged?
Yes.
Charge your phones.
Good idea.
Okay.
Okay.
See?
We turned panic into preparedness.
Now if we do run out of gas, guess who's got fully charged phones?
Well charged.
Full battery.
For the love of God, stop charging your phones!
Aah!
Excuse me a moment.
What happened?
I'm not telling you!
Fair enough.
We're all gonna die!
All in favor?
And that solves the matter of the giant hand.
If there's no other business.
Yes.
I'd like to move that we establish this moment as the opening for a flashback.
No.
Meeting adjourned.
Oh, I guess we'll not doing the three weeks earlier thing.
Abed insert dialogue here by you dropping the fourth wall shtick.
Nice.
Careful you don't flood it.
That's the fifth time you've reminded me not to flood something.
I'm sorry but it doesn't apply to our situation.
I'm gonna check the battery.
Can you send someone or not?
Can you please hold?
No, I can't hold.
Darn it.
When they put you on hold, you hang up and you call right back.
Frankie taught me that.
Hi, it's me.
Yeah, the one you put on hold.
See where that got you?
Can you send somebody or not?
Please hold.
Don't you dare.
When they put you on hold, hang up and call right back.
I can play this game all day.
I told you we need roadside service on - Could you please hold?
Oh, you can't be serious.
Well hello, guess who.
I got nothing but fingers and time, pal.
Road side service, Moffett pass.
All right, all right.
You, well, you could've told me that an hour ago.
RV is full of crazy ladies.
Your RV is full of crazy ladies, good bye.
Have any of you heard of Armed Forces Day?
Because apparently it's today and it's really boning us.
Yep, here it is, Armed Forces Day, huh.
Why would they put it in May?
It's just sitting there in Memorial Day's shadow like a military Hanukkah.
Fitting that both war holidays have to fight each other over the same month.
Notable that the one we remember is the one with the theme of memory.
Way to make this about justifying your unmarketable sensibilities.
Well, apparently Armed Forces Day is the big one for tow truck drivers.
Because there are three within they're all in the same parade.
Maybe it'll come by this way if we offer them instruments?
Nobody reroutes parades.
They rerouted Kennedy's parade.
So, we'll just call the CIA, tell them we want to assassinate the President, and we'll be home in time for Wheel of Fortune.
Who are we kidding?
That'll never work.
We got Britta'd, yes, I use it too.
I don't want anybody here blaming themselves for this.
I want everyone blaming Frankie.
What?
She is the reason we are here.
This is what happens when you make decisions outside the moment.
Whatever moment you were in the day you got on the Internet and bought a gigantic hand, I am proud to remain outside until I die.
You will baby.
And this is where logic gets you, stuck in a Rocky Mountain pass at sundown, gradually freezing to death.
And forced to decide somewhere in the backs of our heads, just in case, who we'd eat first.
Annie, right?
What?
It's not a judgement, it's about biology.
What?
Craig, the hand currently crushing our lives is not about being in the moment.
You bought this thing we can't return with money we don't have, nobody knows why.
And your latest idea is to put it on the quad with a plaque that says give a hand to your brain.
Give your brain a hand.
You're making it sound stupid on purpose.
It's over Craig, you are lucky to have Frankie.
And you're lucky she was able to find some weirdo, excuse me, bigger weirdo on eBay willing to pay cash for it.
This is a lot of narrative pipe.
Maybe we did need a three weeks earlier flashback.
Abed.
Is this a show?
I thought you said you knew it wasn't a TV show.
Season two you mean?
I don't know.
I can change my mind.
Well can I ask that it not be a show about you saying it's a show?
Because dumb.
You're dumb.
Go in the back.
Go in the back and sit by yourself.
Jeff.
Give him a shot.
What's wrong with you?
I'm sick of it.
It's a show, it's not a show, it's your show, it's my show, it's a good show, it's a bad show.
I am sick of it.
I don't want to hear the word show again.
Show, show, show, is a show, show, show.
So now it's a show about this?
Oh, you're right, that's way worse.
Abed, come back.
Yes.
Yay.
Abed, come back.
Yes, yes, yes.
I'm not sorry.
It's not good to be back.
What the hell was that?
The battery is dead.
Flooded?
So help me God.
The RV has two batteries, a primary, and a second - Secondary.
We overloaded the electrical system, and killed the engine battery.
So now, the secondary battery has maybe three or four hours of juice - Charge, juice, charge.
Then we have a choice to make.
And Jeff can explain that choice.
No, it's your RV.
This was my show.
You didn't give a damn about that.
Abed, we're all on your side, so if you're also on your side, it's petty.
We could wait for a couple of hours and hope that the engine battery resets itself.
If it doesn't, then we're spending the night here, and at least we have the secondary battery to keep us warm for a few hours.
No, no, no, we're not spending the night here, so what's the second option?
Which I am nicknaming little course of action.
I rewire the secondary battery to the engine and hope it can start it.
If it doesn't we're spending a very cold night with two dead batteries.
Okay, let's switch the batteries then.
Good democracy.
Are we sure the secondary battery won't just die too?
Ha.
It's a possibility.
It exists.
But I'm pretty confident, because the secondary battery only powers the cabin.
And we've kept the lights off and it goes without saying that we've all learned to stop charging our phones.
Why you all looking at each other like that?
And where are each of your phones now?
You know, I'm starting to suspect the unthinkable.
Namely, that in spite of all we've experienced, there's a cartoonish vampiric orgy of personal devices somewhere in the RV sucking away our remaining battery.
I only draw limited comfort from the fact that nobody's running to unplug anything.
You know what?
Say nothing.
I'll just, turn the light switch to the on position.
There is a bright side to this.
Most conventional weapons don't require electricity.
Are you going to eat me first?
Hear those crickets?
This would be a challenging place to practice your stand-up act.
So I rented Hotel Rwanda the other night.
And let me just say, not a date movie.
What would Arnold Schwarzenegger sound like if he was bit by Dracula?
All in favor?
Then that solves the matter of the giant hand.
If there's no other business - If we're doing this I'd like to restate importance of telling some of this story with flashback.
What do you mean by restate?
Oh my god, I fell for it.
Meeting adjourned.
Why do we call them elbows?
Why not arm knees?
Man, I am dying up here.
I'm scaling the blanket rations inversely to the wattage of each person's phone.
That way the person who killed us the most will die the soonest, which feels fair.
Right, Britta?
I can't go all night being this angry.
Heart attacks run in my family and you people aren't worth it.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I caused the situation by not topping off the tank, and that vinyl accordion partition is a totem of distrust.
Sorry for that, too.
Elroy, that's big of you.
And for our part, we're sorry that charging our perfectly normal cell phones destroyed your weirdly fragile RV.
Okay, I'm sorry about that apology.
I'll try to be a better house guest.
Oh, no.
Sorry I've been unavailable, I've been trying to cut to three weeks earlier.
Really feels like we needed that.
I have something to apologize for as well.
Perhaps you recall earlier when it seemed as though we drove through a skunk patch.
Yeah, you were getting high.
Yeah, you were smoking pot.
Yeah, getting high.
You were getting stoned.
Oh, okay, I remember thinking I really pulled that one off.
You thought that because you were high.
You also thought that we were speeding cuz you kept seeing the same bird.
All in favor?
Then that solves the matter of the giant hand.
If there's no other business - Let me just explain the need for flashback here and don't interrupt - Okay, one quick thing and then you can talk about flashbacks forever.
Meeting adjourned.
Abed?
When they cut to three weeks earlier on TV, they're not traveling in time, dip ass.
Jeff.
Okay, my apology now.
I've had some time to think about it, and I've decided, I'm sorry for not asking people what they wanted before buying all the snacks for the trip.
Wow, really?
That's great.
What?
Think about it, it's the worst thing I've done on this trip.
I've been nailing it.
She has.
You have, I haven't been.
I shouldn't be yelling at the dean in front of any of you, it's unprofessional.
You're all right Frankie.
We got no complaints.
I forgive all of you.
What?
Then that solves the matter of the giant hand.
If there's no other business - In a normal road trip story the first act would end with us deciding to go on the trip.
The second act would be the trip ending with a disaster, and the third act would be us getting back.
The problem is that we've already decided to take this trip weeks from now, which means the story starts with us already on the road, which means the end of act one won't be us going on the trip, it'll have to be the disaster.
Which means something even worse has to happen in act two.
Unless we make the decision, right now, that act one is a flashback, so that the beginning story is now instead of then.
You forgive us?
Absolutely.
You turd!
I beg your pardon.
Guys?
You have no sense of accountability.
You're like a child.
If I'm a child, you're a child abuser.
No, not cool, Annie.
You never just said, leave my hand where it is, I like it there.
I demand it stay.
Because everyone complained about it.
Well, where's that commitment to spinelessness when we're all admitting we did stuff wrong?
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm a bad dean, okay?
No, that's what you always do.
That's not a real apology.
Jeff?
Abed, shut up.
Go flashback and cut to stuff.
And you, say you're sorry for buying a giant hand and letting it sit around until we had to deal with it, and say it without crying.
No!
I'm an adult.
And you can't make me not cry.
You're all a bunch of bullies, and I will say, I'm sorry, however I want.
And by the way, I'm not sorry!
It's my giant hand and I love it.
We're not selling it.
Okay, this is like crate training a puppy.
Everyone suppress every instinct you have to let him out and sleep in bed with us.
Cold.
No, I mean, it's cold in the RV.
I don't care how we treat the dean tonight.
Abed, don't go out.
Did they send you out here to be mean to me too?
No.
Good.
Because I can't cry anymore unless someone brings me a Pedialyte.
Here.
Pretty comforting, huh?
We could've put it outside the Art Department, or Biology, or wood working if we remove one of the fingers.
You don't belong up here.
It's not right that you're up here.
You get it, don't you, Abed?
You know what's important about the hand?
No, I know what's important about the story, and I know we're structurally overdue for a disaster.
Oh, great.
Figures the one person on my side, is the one playing people chess.
Aah!
Don't move, don't move!
What the hell else are we supposed to do?
Flashback with me.
What?
Just trust me.
I set a flashback three weeks earlier.
It's how this story begins.
Close your eyes and concentrate.
And that solves the matter of the giant hand.
If there's no other business.
Oh, there's business.
Yeah, there's business.
When you tie the hand to the roof we'd like you to use extra thick straps please.
Extra thick.
Extra thick straps!
Reinforced.
All right.
Meeting adjourned, great.
Extra thick straps!
Extra think straps.
Extra thick straps.
Extra thick straps.
There, that should do it.
Wha, wha, what should do it?
We made the straps extra thick.
Remember?
No, I don't remember because it didn't happen.
It didn't?
Aah!
What?
Did something just fall off the roof?
That's a really stupid question, Annie.
Obviously something fell off the roof.
The question is what?
Abed, where's the dean?
Oh, damn, come on.
Okay, one, two, three.
Carefully, carefully.
How do you lose a hand off a person haphazardly?
You know what, Annie - Aah!
Dean, hang on.
Dean, we're so sorry, we love you.
Screw you!
Aah!
What?
Hey, that's my house.
We are not sorry, we hate you!
Are we gonna freeze to death?
I call the hand.
The fiberglass will preserve body heat.
What's wrong with me if that's hot?
Dean these temperatures are lowering our immune systems in a world that is swarming with weird people's unvaccinated toddlers.
Deal with it.
I'm gonna go run to the other side and see if he's locked that door too.
It probably undercuts my goals to announce it out loud but I'm a verbal thinker, I'm not even sure I have an idea until I say it.
They should make hiking boots with a compass in the toe.
Go!
But don't you.
Dean, we're sorry and we love you?
Nice uncontrollable question mark, Britta!
You can't even fake it!
Dean, we're sorry and we love you.
Super realistic, Annie, you're a real sociopath.
I saw all your true colors when the chips were down.
Abed is the only human among you!
And I think we all know how ironic that is, no offense, Abed.
None possible.
Abed, you bonded with him.
Talk to him.
You're alone in the end zone.
This ball is yours or nobody's.
I appreciate your appeal to my well know passion for athletics, and sarcasm, but I didn't actually bond with him.
I almost killed him.
My naive obsession with contrived flashback technique has kept me from being invested in any of this actual story.
I mean, what was it even?
A bunch of people in an RV?
And I had to Christopher Nolan it?
Well, there you go.
Now you can forget all about stupid three weeks earlier flashbacks and be a hero by joining us here, in the moment, and talking to the dean like a human.
That's my arc.
That's your arc.
Okay, here we go.
If there's no other business.
I'd like to propose a heavy use of flashback in this episode.
No Abed, don't do it.
Thanks Abed.
Stop that.
Get your head our of your ass.
I don't know how.
I'm over saturated with it.
Give me, I, I, I don't know what's real.
You are lying.
You have to be lying.
You enjoy this.
Stop this.
What has gotten into you?
Why are you shocked that he's alienated?
You get him to do something normal without abusing him.
Abed, listen.
This is a flashback remember.
The real story is happening in the future.
You actually flashed back to now to help us.
Okay, that was pretty good.
So sad what happened here, all those centons ago.
So sad.
So preventable.
Space Elder Abed, can you reach backward with your mind and save our species?
I can.
I'm Space Elder Britta.
What are you guys talkin about?
I'm here now, child.
All will be made right.
Dean.
Abed.
I have discovered the meaning of the giant hand.
A hand has two functions, to grip and to release.
But without both of these powers, it is useless.
Like newborn infants, we grab what comes near us, hoping to control it, taste it, jam it into another child's eye.
But, the time we spend in control of our world, is the time we spend letting go of others.
Ideas, stories, pride, girls in soft sweaters, video games, buttered noodles, grip one for too long and you lose so much that you've never held.
This giant hand, was sent to all of us as an invitation.
To increase our mastery over the power to hold on.
And let go.
Sorry.
Dummy.
I kinda hate you.
The doors are locked on that side, too.
Took you long enough.
I'd be lying if I said I didn't poop.
Could you lie then?
Sure I can.
Sure I can.
I slapped a man.
Hi, this is Blake, the gentleman to whom you're selling the giant hand.
I am calling to confirm that you have the correct address?
We live at the end of a long driveway which often gets confused with a road.
Anyway, it's been many hours since our scheduled appointment time.
Again, it's Blake with a B, the purchaser of the giant hand.
Bye.
They're not coming, are they?
I don't know, Karen.
I left a message.
What are you gonna do with?
What am I gonna do with the giant watch?
I don't know.
I, I don't plan for failure.
Have you tried planning for success?
Does everything you do to this family have.
No.
Finish your thought.
Finish your thought.
Does everything have to do with me, purchasing oversize items on the Internet.
But, that's not what this is really about, is it?
It's not about a giant hand, or a giant watch.
Please don't.
It's about a normal sized son.
Who disappeared and it's all my fault, because I gave him a giant kite!
Yes, how could you not make that connection?
Why do you continue to buy giant size versions of everyday objects, when they are the reason our son is - Disappeared!
Disappeared.
They never found his body on the ground, which proves he's still up there waiting.
He's waiting for a better daddy, with a bigger hand.
Oh, really?
So then why the watch?
I thought it would look really cool.
I'm gonna walk the dog, and eventually leave you.
I'll put the watch in the garage.
And probably stop showering.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
I'm gonna go get a shovel because theater is dead.
Shh.
- Hi, Star-Burns.
- Oh!
Todd.
You know you don't have to creep around to be weird, right?
You're weird at picnics.
Did you hear about the paintball game?
I heard there was no paintball.
I heard it's banned.
Well, you can't believe everything you hear.
Okay, you just asked if I heard something and now you're invalidating the whole Do you know why I beat you, Todd?
Seriously?
You don't?
Because I don't either, that was insane.
I'm 50 here.
I think I could win this year.
I think I could go all the way.
Actually, you'll be settling for silver.
Names.
You give me names or you're expelled, that simple.
I told you, I don't know nothing about no secret paintball games.
This is from huffing paint, I swear.
Escort Alex Osbourne off campus.
Hey, hey, hold your horse panties.
You didn't tell me you knew my name.
Look, I was about to take Todd out and then we both got shot.
The guy was invisible, a ghost.
Uses silver paint.
- A ghost.
So no name?
- I'd call him Silver Ghost but it's probably already taken by an indie comic book or a terrible tequila.
Bye forever, Star-Burns.
No, no.
No, no, no.
- Frankie.
- I respect that you are my boss so either fire me or let me handle this, and go to your office.
I wanna give your paintball friends a message, Jeff.
- Good morning.
- This era is over.
It was fun while it lasted, but now Mommy's home.
Everybody with a gun will be expelled or fired.
Don't worry, my boys and I will get this cleaned up in no time.
Thank you.
Jeff do you know Deputy Custodian Lapari?
We haven't had the pleasure.
Mr. Winger's caused me nothing but pain over the years with his paintballing.
- I'm sorry.
I quit that, that's behind me.
- Sure it is.
Handling turds has rubbed off on him.
Lapari is gonna be honored this week at the Gala for a Cleaner Greendale.
- I'd like you to introduce him.
- Why would I?
You're the de facto leader of Greendale.
If you gave a speech coming out against paintball, it might end it.
No, no, just because I'm not playing doesn't mean I'm the weenie that tells people not to.
Please?
If not for Greendale then for me?
I'll think about it.
- I was a different guy back then.
- Never mind.
Well, Frankie's upset.
Did she break up with someone?
Which gender?
- I don't care, but everybody else does.
- She's upset about paintball.
- Paint?
Ball?
- Occasionally our campus erupts into a postmodern homage to action-adventure mythology mischaracterized by the ignorant as parody.
Apparently, now that Frankie's declared it illegal it's gone underground and is still happening as we speak.
Maybe for freshmen.
But we've kind of done it to death, right?
Done it, nailed it.
I won a few times, no?
- Who keeps track of that?
Lame.
- I'm thinking mostly about Frankie.
She's our friend and cares about this school.
I think it'd break her heart if she caught any of us undermining her goals.
Yeah, agreed.
Reasonable agreement.
You're both right.
Meeting adjourned I guess.
This is good.
I'm glad we all agree not to do this.
It's gonna make it a lot easier for me to beat you.
What the hell?
They killed me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Do something stupid.
- I thought we weren't playing.
- Is this an alliance?
- Is it?
- What's paintball?
- Cut the crap.
- Stop that.
What are you doing?
- Uhn!
Go back to class.
- Winger's playing paintball.
- No, he's not.
Think about it or don't, but don't do it.
- Uhn!
Uhn!
- Grow up.
- What are you doing?
I'm not playing.
- For a guy who's not playing you're shooting a bunch of mothers.
- That was instinct.
I can't help being a bad-ass.
But I am not playing.
- Okay, so let's make this painless.
- Take it easy.
- Leave her alone.
- Knock it off, Frankie is coming.
What is important to you people?
Jeff Winger shot me.
Do I use echolocation to navigate?
Why'd you ask that?
You're not a bat.
Hello.
- Hi, Frankie.
- Frankie.
Jeff, a student just passed by me and said you shot him, with paint.
Uh Okay.
So you are definitely not playing paintball.
- No.
- Frankie, I've been cool up until now but I gotta tell you, I'm starting to get offended by your suspicion.
Well Well is a hole in the ground when you're thirsty.
I'm telling you, I ain't playing no paintball.
- Bam!
- Okay.
Take it easy, guys.
And for what it's worth, thank you for teaching me the cool new way to respond to people saying the word "well".
Ha-ha.
- All right, guys.
- Bye, Franks.
- Bye, Frankie.
- Take it easy.
- Bye.
- See you.
- Will you stop doing that?
- Don't hate the player.
Colloquialisms aside, Annie's right.
The thing to hate this year is the game.
Can I show you all something?
This game is being run anonymously through a server, but who set it up?
They haven't left a clue, which is a big clue, because if they're this good - Why are they here?
- Whoever's running it is offering a cash prize to the winner, more evidence they don't go here.
And they seem to have their own man in the game.
You've heard about a mysterious player using silver paintballs.
Well, look at these IP addresses.
If that means what I think it means, we're dealing with gibberish.
- Those are mine.
- That's a student or teacher opening an encrypted tunnel to an off-campus site.
I do that all the time.
- I save it all for Saturday night.
- Right, no big deal.
Unless you always do it immediately before a player is taken out with silver paintballs by an unknown shooter.
And unless the IP address that you're connecting to is this one.
- Of course.
- Who's the silver-paintballs guy?
Spy, assassin, mercenary a bad person walking among us laughing, laughing quietly then pretending he was looking at something funny.
I suppose you all should be in trouble.
But desperate deans But But desperate But des But desperate deans calls for dean-sperate measures.
From here on out, you work for me.
Everything you're saying just proves my point.
That the only way to lose this game is to play it.
I say we do the honest thing and tell Frankie.
The school's playing and losing.
Frankie included.
If we play to win, we not only take City College's money we can expose Silver Ballz and City College and save Greendale.
- Which is basically saving Frankie.
- So we lay low and try to find out who Silver Ballz is.
To be clear, we did not vote on that name.
Here's a name you don't have to vote on.
You just became the Secret Dean Force.
The Dean Boys.
Task Force Dean.
His Dean's Secret People.
I know the word "Dean" is in it.
Because when the politicians fail and the peace talks fall apart when it seems like all is lost and nobody really needs the dean anymore because Frankie's here, that's when you go in.
The last bastion of a bygone era when people respected me.
Dean Force.
One.
If you're gonna hang around, we could use some water.
On it.
"Club Club".
The last club I thought I'd ever join.
Your target is a small-time paintball munitions dealer.
All we know is he's a white male over 30, and his street name is Fun Dad.
All right, is everybody in this club ready to party the way they do in clubs?
Connor, stop horsing around with Billy, and party.
The DJ might be the guy from MeowMeowBeenz.
We need clean intelligence, Abed.
No references, no callbacks.
Excuse me, good sir, if I could have the mic.
Attention shoppers, there's a sale on partying in my pants aisle everything in my pants must go.
Well, not everything, that doesn't You know what I - Koogler.
- Aladdin.
I thought your name was Fun Dad.
- No - That was easy.
I need ammunition.
- Are you a narc?
- Why would I answer honestly?
Good point.
That's how most people answer, so It's a bad question.
We just get so many narcs.
Don't forget there's a sign-up sheet on the back wall for "Club Club" Club.
Listen, I'm so glad, Omar, that you're interested in paintball.
I have to tell you, no shooting in here.
The first rule of Club Club is that we are not a fight club.
The second rule is that if you're a hot lady you have to have sex with me.
Then there's a bunch of rules that they've been adding because of the lawsuits based on that second rule which I'm not allowed to call a rule, that was my screw-up.
Let me show you what I got here.
These are Blue Travelers.
I think I've got some Sarcastic Mellow Yellows in here.
Those are great.
And these are Green Meanies.
They explode on contact and they mark your target with paint.
That's every paintball.
You know your stuff.
Why don't I give you a pro discount?
I'm thinking something more exotic.
Something in silver?
Yeah.
Okay, great, I think that's a great idea.
If you wanna stay in the game, talk.
Okay, look, if you're a narc, you can't play and if you're playing, I do accept sex for ammo.
Or beer, right?
But not bitcoin.
I mean, I believe in it.
I think I feel like I need it to stabilize.
Who is Silver Man?
My accountant?
Well, how do you know David?
You know what I mean.
Who buys silver ammo?
I can't.
Look, if I tell you that, I'm pretendsies dead.
- Koogler?
- They got him.
That's good.
Then he won't be needing this.
Koogler's thumb drive is actually a hardware encryption key.
Can it be unencrypted?
No, you use it to decrypt something encrypted.
A key with a lock on it.
I'll give our enemy this, they're clever.
Why did they pair us together?
Look, a message chain between Koogler and Silver Ballz.
Now, he's ordering a huge batch of ammo and stressing that he needs it before the gala.
- City College is - Oh City College is going to crash Frankie's gala.
And here's where Silver Ballz decides on silver balls.
"Which color will look coolest against a navy-blue jumpsuit"?
Who wears a jumpsuit to a black-tie gala?
The guest of honor.
Is your Internet not working?
It's one photo.
It's taking an hour.
You have keystrokes programmed to?
Eesh.
That's dorky.
Looks like we'll be renting formal wear.
I'll measure Jeffrey.
Mr. Winger.
You clean up nice.
Oh, come on.
I'm always good-Iooking.
This seems ambitious.
Well, the monorail is more symbolic of our potential than it is potential.
And none of our buildings will ever be shaped like this.
But with a little work, this is how we could feel.
You should be proud.
Thank you, Jeff, for supporting this.
Why is that in your ear?
Oh, I'm raising awareness of Armenian American stereotypes.
Bale to Belfry, let's check in.
Should stereotypes have their awareness raised?
Oh, good Lord, I'm questioning you again.
Why?
Follow your bliss, sir.
You've earned it.
Keaton to Belfry.
I need us all to make sure we are very, very careful here.
Why don't you set a good example by keeping your mind on the mission?
And your eyes on the prize.
Prize is secure, Keaton out.
West to Belfry, entrances secure.
Keaton to Kilmer, status?
Kilmer to Belfry.
I'm currently examining a spoon, only I'm not really examining it.
I'm using it as cover while watching a somewhat suspicious waiter.
Voice of Deidrich Bader to Belfry.
I've checked the custodial wing for the third time.
Can I join the mission now?
Negative, continue to check the custodial wing and then check the perimeter of the inside of your office.
Okay.
And for the record, I feel very vulnerable without a gun.
Ugh.
Is that the only song that plays in this thing?
Hey there, dean.
New custodian.
- Dean.
- Dean.
- Dean.
- Dean.
Clooney to Belfry, I've got a bogey with a gun.
Excuse me?
I wasn't talking to you.
I was ordering dinner.
Yes, hello, can I get a bogey with a gun no pickles and three orders of gun.
Damn it.
Clooney slopped the bogey and now he's headed for the kitchen.
- Should we go?
- We don't know it's our man.
Kilmer, Clooney, do nothing unless you can do it quietly and calmly.
- What the hell?
- Nothing.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
- Clooney to Kilmer.
- What?
- Should I come in now?
- No.
No, you can't ever come in, ever.
You're sloppy.
- Excuse me, can have a word with you?
- About what?
Well, there's been some reports about a paintball game on campus.
Oh, you better believe the kitchen boys are playing.
And this year, we got a new winning strategy.
Let the idiots come to you.
Oh, really?
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, Britta, you can come in now.
- Aah!
- Uhn!
I'm sorry.
I stand before you, one of Greendale's biggest perpetrators of paint-related mayhem and I am happy to say that those days are fully behind our school.
Looking back on those dark days, it's clear that the only heroes were the janitors and the custodians - left to clean up our messes.
- My rolls.
Stop.
So it is with great shame and poetic irony that I present the Custodial Innovation Award to Vice Custodian Lapari.
- What are you doing in there?
- Jeff, focus.
- You all right?
- Yes.
It wasn't our guy.
The assassin is not in the kitchen, he's still at large.
And now let's all enact what I hope will become a yearly tradition the popping of the balloons.
- What?
Stay calm.
Check your zones.
- Who's that?
- Where?
- Where?
- I don't see anything.
There.
I'm sorry.
It's the custodians.
Greendale's custodial staff is running the underground paintball tournament.
Probably with City College money.
The people that clean Greendale don't want a cleaner Greendale.
They want Greendale to be afraid of itself and reliant on them.
Oh, what an exciting story.
We've got a real-life M. Night "Shyamala-yan" here.
It's "Shyamalan".
Unfortunately, as with his stories, I don't anticipate yours holding up.
- Easy target.
- Who's heckling me?
Oh, of course, it's the Indian guy.
- I'm Arabic.
- Gah.
Okay, let's go with that.
Anyway, you know what goes great with crazy stories?
Evidence.
You're the evidence.
Come back to our side and tell the truth so City College can be exposed.
Or I could leave and get a job at City College where their payphones aren't only herpe-free, they're actually removed.
You think City College will take you if you lose their paintball prize money?
I don't know how many men you have left but if you're leaving this room, it needs to be a small army.
Okay, I agree.
No!
Look out!
- Oh.
- Uhn!
- No!
- No!
Damn it.
- We're the last ones left?
- Cover me.
Dreams do come true.
Okay, we got him.
He went into a supply closet.
I know, I guess to a custodian, a supply closet is like a location.
I'm relieved.
I thought this was gonna be a whole gauntlet.
My heart was not in it.
I mean, I shot a disabled kid.
I can't do this anymore.
- What are you looking at?
- This isn't a closet.
It's really nice of you guys to visit.
Not that you ever would have done it intentionally.
Your steamy pipes can't stop us.
Well, it would be a pretty bad museum exhibit if it could.
Give it up, Lapari.
Hey, dean, I have a microphone, you have a beer, God has a plan.
I have a beer?
It's an old stand-up line for using on hecklers.
Keep moving.
Did you do stand-up?
Is that how you became a custodian?
Listen, man, I was there in the '90s I did a few open-mic nights, saw what karaoke did.
It wasn't cool, man.
We're not so different, you and I, dean.
Don't you see we're both in the same situation?
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
Screw it.
Shoot them all.
One of them is him.
Shoot every single one.
- He's not back here.
- Okay, reload.
There must be a mop jousting bridge over sawdust canyon.
We're both dinosaurs roaring in vain at the mammals.
What'd you think was gonna happen when you let Frankie Dart into our world?
How much more clean can she make this school before she notices the dirtiest thing of all about it?
You think I'm a villain, but I'm not.
I'm defending a place where we all get to be our own heroes.
We're all here because none of us can have nice things.
Aah!
I thought you guys were mannequins.
What a backfire.
Is the money real?
No matter who wins?
Dean, what are you doing?
What are you thinking about?
I don't know, I don't know.
He's right, Jeffrey.
A cleaner Greendale?
- It's like a healthier cigarette.
- Yes, a carrot stick.
- Frankie can make us a carrot stick.
- We're tobacco.
No, we are not tobacco.
We're Robert Downey Jr
He was so high, he was crawling into peoples' windows.
Now he's Iron Man.
We self-destruct like this because we'd rather be heroes and villains than just kind of sucky people that need to work at getting less sucky.
She will forgive us.
I know her, I like her, and if she fires either of you, I'll quit.
She's not the enemy, she can help us, we just have to cool it.
It's true, what he said.
If you guys lower your guns, I'm not gonna throw you a party but I'm not gonna get anyone fired either.
I'll see you Monday.
Idiots.
- So who wins, what do we?
- Okay on the count of three we're gonna shoot ourselves in the foot.
One, two I'll see you guys on Monday.
And the pope looks at the giraffe and says: "I'm in the room" Sorry, I can't remember the whole joke.
It's okay.
It sounds very funny based on the last line.
Frankie's gonna be here soon.
Get ready.
We're not still doing this, are we?
We promised every day for a week.
Do you want her to quit?
- Good morning, everyone.
- Waah.
So where did we leave off last time?
Yes, sir?
"I like big trucks.
I saw a fire truck today".
Interesting.
Anyone care to comment?
Elroy?
I made a stinky.
Worth considering.
Next item.
- How do you pronounce "ba-sketty"?
- Spaghetti.
What else?
- Can we go to the zoo?
- That raises a very important point.
We can do anything we want, if And this is very important.
If we grow up.
- All in favor?
- Waah.
Then she starts singing about all the places she's been.
Which, by the way, seems to be a total of two, one of which is old D.C. Old D.C. Okay, fine, Vicki.
You're a music major, not a history major.
And the whole mother thing.
The two big feathers in her cap are that she hasn't let anything change her a triumph she shares with most animals and all dirt and the fact that her mother died.
Which is like the one thing all mothers do.
I mean, was she a good mother, did she collect stamps, did she race cars?
We don't know.
We don't know her name.
If you asked Vicki the color of her mother's eyes, she would say, "Dead".
Or maybe she'd say, "Seven dollars a seat".
Damn, man, I am telling you, nobody is safe.
Nobody is safe.
Blue.
They were a very pale shade of blue.
I'm sorry my show didn't honor her memory properly.
I'll try to make it up to you.
Actually, we both will at the premiere of our new show.
Vicki and Garrett.
And let's have a hand for Vicki's mother, everybody.
Yeah, stand up, Connie.
Vicki's mother.
Vicki's mother.
We'd rather you boo, it means you felt something.
That's right, you can boo.
- Andy Kaufman loved booing.
- Mm-hm.
Then again, we did put a fair share of work into this.
You don't have to be dicks.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Abed, what are you doing?
Freelancing.
You're not a spy for the city, are you?
They've been sending footage of my classroom and pronounced me no worse than the teachers that work hard.
I can't tell you who I'm working for.
It's a surprise.
Well, don't get in the way.
You know the rules, Jeff.
The sooner you ignore me, the sooner I stop being a factor.
All right, people.
Yesterday I wrote the word law on the board.
This time, don't erase it, and maybe tomorrow we'll get even further.
Now, I'm told Garrett has prepared a presentation for extra credit.
By the way, everyone in class gets the credit because I'm not sure how much I should encourage this.
Go ahead, Garrett.
Thank you.
My presentation is about marriage law.
This is me, Garrett.
I'm in your class.
This is Stacy.
She is in our class as well.
This is what I want.
Oh, Garrett.
Stacy, will you marry me?
Oh.
Yes, yes, Garrett, yes, I will!
Oh, Garrett!
Garrett and I have been seeing each other for We met at the school store, Pencils and Such.
He said he was there for the such.
I remember I was sweating a lot, and breathing heavy, and my heart felt like it was going to burst in my chest.
But the day I met Stacy, most of those symptoms actually declined.
Are you quite done?
Yeah.
Garrett wanted the proposal recorded.
He thought his family might wanna see proof.
So now what are you shooting?
You had a strange look on your face.
Oh, you're noticing faces now?
Mm-hm.
Aren't you still smelling hair to tell Frankie from Annie?
Yeah.
Well, it's official.
I'm getting laid.
Give me some more time in a dream.
Give me the hope to run out of steam.
Somebody said it could be here.
We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year.
I can't count the reasons I should stay.
One by one, they all just fade away.
What are you doing?
Stop.
Hey, stop.
If you don't put that silly thing away, I swear, I'm gonna stop loving you.
Oh, that's it.
Happy birthday.
What are you two doing?
We're doing Annie's missing lover footage.
You, you know in movies where the hero's wife or girlfriend is dead or missing, and so he sits in the dark and he watches her in a home movie, or - Or a hologram.
Or a hologram over and over, and she's always beautiful and full of love, almost to the point of being stupid.
We're making footage like that for me in case I get kidnapped or murdered.
Oh, super healthy, guys.
The health department called.
They don't want anything back.
Britta, don't look at the camera.
Okay, look at the camera.
Today's Garrett's wedding.
For those who don't know, Garrett, he's a guy we don't really know, that we've known for like six years at school, the funny-looking guy.
Britta, mean!
Sorry!
The eccentric-looking guy.
What's happening?
Everything's going wrong.
That guy.
Remember when we said we were cleaning?
Yeah.
But remember about Abed's documentary?
The documentary is about what we're doing.
And we're cleaning.
Yeah, but if we're both cleaning then there's nobody to explain why.
She doesn't understand filmmaking.
I lived in New York.
What else should we talk about?
We volunteered our apartment as a staging area where our friends can get ready and keep each other on time.
Oh.
The thing to understand about our friends is that friends isn't an adequate label.
We're an intensely, intimately bonded crew.
Oh, I can't, no!
No!
Do you want flashy forward, or cherry and classic?
Do you have black?
That's a no.
That beleaguered sigh means, no, I can't have black nails.
Don't look at the camera.
You absolutely can, and we all will when our bodies decompose.
Please don't Jim the camera like that.
Jim the camera?
The color black hasn't had - It's not a color.
Anything to do with death or edginess since '89!
I mean, absence of color.
My accountant has black nails!
Your what?
!
Don't jump on that, my accountant, it's a figure of speech.
It's a form of speech called making things up.
Abed, can you get that?
I can film you getting it.
It's open!
Is it?
I don't know, let's see.
Frankie.
Hi girl.
So, I didn't, put on my wedding clothes, like you said.
So we can get dressed together and be girls together.
This is gonna be fun.
Annie and Britta told me to come over and get ready with them for Garrett's wedding.
I didn't say no.
Who says no to something like that?
A cold, off-putting incompatible person.
The kind of person that turns a sleepover into a stoning.
I had rocks, thrown at me.
Biblical, igneous, jagged, hateful, pointy, ninja rocks, and that's not gonna happen again.
What have you been up to?
I think you already asked that.
Did you answer?
Didn't I?
I think I did.
I don't think you did.
Well, that's not like me.
Well, maybe you're nervous.
No, no.
Well, why don't we just say that if you did answer, we forgot so we're asking again.
Oh, I have been working.
And I've been tending to my personal affairs.
Mm.
Mia, I don't know if I mentioned.
One of my sisters as well, you know, one of them is deceased, and the other is mentally retarded.
Panty raid.
When I say drink, you say now.
Drink.
Now.
Drink.
Now.
When I say drink, you say now.
Drink.
Now.
Drink.
Now.
Hey what are you guys doing?
We gotta go.
The wedding starts in like 40 minutes.
We batted the time.
Huh?
We lied to you cause we knew you'd be late.
So we lied to you about the time.
Yeah!
You don't need perfect people to make a perfect team.
You need people whose flaws feed into each other.
It's what do you call it?
Co-dependence.
Synergy.
For instance, there might be something Britta hates doing, but Annie loves doing.
Or there might be something that Annie hates doing, but she does it anyways, because what she really loves is to feel useful.
You literally just defined co-dependence.
Here's to synergy.
Oh, look at you.
You little helper.
Oh.
Okay, do you Garrett take Jack Nicholson to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do.
I do, Johnny.
We invented a new game.
Celebrity Garrett marriage.
Christian Slater to be your lawfully wedded wife.
I do.
I do.
Boo.
There's only Nicholson.
Yeah, well, listen to him.
We were genius to pad the time margin.
Because now we have, like, three more hours to play the game.
Okay.
Do you, Garrett, take Aubrey Plaza to be your wife?
I do.
I do.
Wait.
What do you mean, three more hours?
How is that even possible?
What, what time is the wedding?
Wait, what time is it now?
We're late.
We're late.
Aah!
Gather everyone to the car.
What?
Yeah.
We'll drive together.
We are not driving together.
It's already been settled.
Nothing was settled.
What?
They left me home alone.
I'm home alone.
Well, not really.
What the hell you doing?
C'mon, let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Okay geez.
Abed, you too.
Come on.
Oh, yeah.
We are here to witness the union of Garrett and Stacy in the eyes of, well in the eyes of whatever power you choose.
Personally, I find the notion of choosing to be needlessly limited.
What if I'm capable of total contradiction?
What if science and religion were mine to wield as I choose?
What if I'm God?
What if I'm God?
It is likely that I am not, but I think it's totally out of line to take that possibility off of the table.
Now, I understand that vows have been written.
Stacy, when I first saw you, looking at you made me feel good.
Touching you, felt better and knowing you made me realize that without you, I, I am incomplete.
I know I look pretty complete.
Somebody over there laughed at that the wrong way.
You are my body and my soul.
You are my favorite video game.
Yes.
Come on.
Guys, guys guys.
Everybody's looking at us.
Your was louder than what I said.
Welcome!
Everyone back there, you're welcome.
Please join us.
Any of those people could be God.
Okay.
Over there.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yes.
Ow!
Garrett, since we met you have felt so familiar.
I love making sandwiches with you.
I love folding towels with you.
I love giving you your pain killers, at the end of the day.
Aw.
Well that, those aren't really vows.
That's a list of things you love about me, yeah.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
Garrett, do you take Stacy to be your lawfully wedded wife.
I do.
Stacy, do you take Garrett to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold and to honor.
Yes I do.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Garrett Lambert, Garrett you may kiss Mrs. Garrett.
Where the party at?
Okay, let's endure this.
Are we mailing today, or what?
Who would have thought Barrett's wedding would be the best day of our lives.
Definitely not Garrett, since his name's not Barrett.
Whoopsie.
We say a wrong a name.
Oh!
Racist.
Oh, no.
You a racist.
That guy's a racist.
From here to there is racist.
Hm.
Oh.
Hi.
Having a good time?
Oh, yes.
Are you Garrett's mom?
I sure am.
Aw.
I think you guys could maybe take a step back, gain a little perspective, so you don't wreck the whole night for some really wonderful people.
You came to a wedding in the middle of the vows through a bush.
I'm not Dr. Phil, but, I don't want my son to kill himself, so, do what you gotta do!
Yeah.
Hm.
Holy crap.
What have we done?
Okay, we just got checked.
Mm-hm.
And it was pretty deserved.
But, we're not just gonna stand here and lick our wounds either.
Jeff is right.
And that chipper passive aggressive lady, she's right, too.
So, let's spread out and - Be the best wedding guests, anyone has ever seen!
Yes.
Yeah.
I'm not gonna over think it, I'm just gonna try it.
Try it.
Okay.
Yes.
Hey.
Mazel tov.
So, a stranger walked over to our very proud group and smashed our pride into pieces with a hammer, which definitely felt like a disaster.
Then, I started to pick up the pieces of our pride, and weirdly enough, the first piece I picked up was my own pride, all of it.
It's almost like groups and people in groups, can never be complete at the same time.
Does that make any sense?
No?
Well, that's your problem.
I love you, Abed.
Do I know how to be a good wedding guest?
Yes, I do.
A little too well, that's the problem.
My name is Elroy Patashnik, and from 2006 to 2009, I was addicted to encouraging white people.
All right!
Now there's a man who knows his meatballs.
Thank you.
It started as simple survival.
The tech industry in the they're either gonna help you or hold you back.
So, you tap the gas, because well, why tap the brake?
Oh, you know, you know what you're doing.
This man knows exactly what he's doing.
I learned the cheat code.
White people like encouragement.
It really doesn't matter what for.
Now, that's a container for liquid.
I never felt like a sellout.
I never laugh at anything unfunny, never said anything untrue.
The thing is, and this will sound racist, white people are very discouraged, and very discouraging to each other.
Sweetie, you, you're getting meatball juice everywhere but your plate.
I think I'm going better than you are, with your asparagus.
Oh, now that's the way to handle meatballs.
And look at you.
Working that asparagus.
So, the day you start telling them, hey, just do what you're doing!
I love you.
I love you.
You feel like a superhero.
But, what's the danger?
Why'd I stop?
You know, same as anything else that makes you feel good.
If you don't put a lid on it.
Oh, look at these pants.
Oh, oh, oh.
He should keep on wearing, keep on wearing his pants.
There's no lid.
Stacy has a 90 year old meemaw here.
I pushed her around the dance floor.
I think she liked it.
No, that's Polly.
No, Great Aunt Polly is Garrett's side.
I haven't met her.
Oh my God, do you think she saw me pushing meemaw, and now she's wondering what's wrong with her?
I'll be right back.
Annie, the world will still need you after you finish your cake.
Am I that bad?
We have the same dragon.
Eventually you will slay it, or train it, or dissolve in its stomach.
Its name is Helping Others.
If I train it, can I give it a cooler name?
If you train it, you can do anything you want.
If you slay it, I don't know.
I guess you get a new dragon named Yourself.
And then you'd be Jeff Winger.
Yeah, that guy needs help!
What would you name your dragon?
I think we need a list of dragon names.
Yeah!
And then we need to get you away from Jeff.
Is what I wanted to say, but how is that my business?
You don't show these to people when you finish them?
No.
Okay, good.
So then why do you make them, again?
It relaxes me.
It's like knitting with less discipline.
Princess Firebreath.
Sir Pent.
Doctor Rachel Spinetail.
Holly Hotbreath.
Ugh.
Jimmy Talon.
Christian Scale.
I got into a bit of a celebrity pun barrel here.
Carson Scaley.
Jude Claw.
Ariana Puffington.
Hi.
Are these your biggest ice cubes?
No, you're boisterous!
Where's my brother!
?
I've gotta thing to say about my friend Garrett!
There has been a plot twist in the story of our comeback as wedding guests.
Garrett's older brother Bones has relapsed during his weekend pass and will be unable to do the best man toast.
You got him?
So, I took Garrett's mom's side and told her after our behavior today, it was the least I could do for them.
And I'm not gonna Winger speech it, this is a thing of substance.
We pooled all the inside info based on all the mingling, and this toast is rocket fueled selflessness.
And this wedding is gonna regret the day it thought we'd make it about us.
Because we're about to be the first guests in history to out-toast the entire wedding party.
God, I love my job!
Wait, this isn't my job.
God, I love myself!
That was Stacy's first time!
But it's not gonna be her last time, right Garrett?
So many classic toast errors.
A fire hydrant could follow this.
I love you so much, and please, keep painting.
Don't let Garrett, don't paint.
Don't let Garrett keep you from painting.
Okay, I'm done.
Okay, Stacy's friend Andi everybody.
Next up we have a replacement best man, Garrett's friend from Greendale College, Jeffrey Winger.
There's a lot of things I can say about this couple.
They're both in my class at Greendale, and like all my students, I give them till about June.
No, you guys'll be fine forever, as long as Stacy never lets Andi babysit.
Or go near a child.
Or be in the same town as a pair of scissors.
This girl's a wreck.
He's being too mean.
No, he's reading the room.
Andi was a bummer, they needed this.
Life's about two people merging their lives, but that means two families are leaving here tonight as one.
That's a big deal.
Now my friends and I came here tonight as outsiders, but thanks to some good advice, we spent the night learning about these two clans of outsiders.
We learned that Garrett's uncle Tony is a photographer.
But Uncle Tony, did you know that Stacy's friend Lawrence makes and sells frames?
Yeah, look each other up, get some business going.
Oh, and Garrett's neighbor Dawn loves vintage cars.
Stacy's chiropractor Susan brought her dad, and guess what?
Her dad worked in an automobile factory in the 60s.
Yeah, I know, these are the kind of things you learn being the biggest jerks at a wedding.
Here's another golden nugget in the gravel.
Some of you have worked the dance floor with Garrett's divine great aunt Polly, 90 years young.
And some of you chatted with Stacy's meemaw, also 90 years young.
Now, I don't know if they've even meT before tonight, but we did learn that both of them were born in the same town.
Sheridan, Wyoming.
Now Garrett and Stacy, would you mind getting them both out here?
All right.
Yeah!
I know Aunt Polly's here.
Isn't she beautiful?
Okay.
Who has got eyes on meemaw?
This is meemaw.
Oh, this is meemaw!
Okay, I feel like an idiot.
I'm so, so sorry.
Garrett, where's Aunt Polly?
Okay.
I, now I don't feel as stupid because either someone here is lying, or this family's a lot closer than we thought.
And now, this is a man that knows how to marry his cousin.
None of this would have happened if I wasn't always trying to help.
Actually, none of this would have happened if I hadn't tried helping you with your helpfulness.
Oh, don't torture yourself with that logic.
None of us would have met if Hitler hadn't been born.
Also none of Britta's arguments would have a default analogy.
Excuse me?
He's saying you go to the Hitler well a lot.
What are you, Hitler, Hitler?
Okay, Britta, we're all the worst right now, take a day off.
I did.
Between us ruining the ceremony and ruining the reception when we were all just individual people, I wasn't the worst.
I'm only the worst with you guys.
Well, me too.
Me too.
I was a good dean before you guys.
Aw.
You can't disprove it.
I relapsed because of you guys.
What?
Oh it's not a big deal.
White people problems.
Oh.
I like this group.
I'm at my best when I'm with you guys.
Well, that clinches it.
Separate cabs.
Separate cabs.
Separate cabs.
Hi!
For those still with us, we won't be cutting the cake or dancing.
And I believe there was a guy in a Homer Simpson costume that was gonna surprise me.
That won't be necessary!
Drive safe, and thank you for coming.
What are you going to do?
Chang!
Chang!
We're going home.
Are you gonna stay married?
Chang!
Chang!
Chang!
We consulted with a lawyer, and it is legal in this state to marry your cousin.
But after talking to our family, we feel an annulment is warranted.
What no, screw that.
Chang.
No.
Chang.
No.
Chang, get back here.
Hey, screw you guys.
No, this family is so screwed up, you thought you were two different families.
Now that you know you're not, you can't wait to leave, and you want this guy to do what?
Forget he's in love?
For you?
You want him to take one for this crappy team?
Let him finish.
They were letting me finish, sir.
I know, I was being sarcastic.
Okay, you know?
Garrett, who loves you here more than Stacy?
Nobody.
Stacy, is it your fault Garrett's your cousin?
No.
Is anyone here going to make less fun of these two or be better friends to them no matter what they do?
No.
No.
No.
It's you against the world, and you will not win.
But, you get to make your moves.
Not them.
Stacy, will you be my legally incestuous wife?
Yes.
Everyone stay and eat cake, or go to hell.
This is about me.
I didn't think I could do it, but I did.
Smile.
Smile.
Garrett, look up.
Yay!
Oh.
So much Jenny.
Wow, what an episode of Community.
Hi, I'm Briggs Haddon credited author of this weeks episode.
You might have noticed an emphasis on the topic of incest, well that's no accident.
For the past two years, when not serving as writer's assistant on Community, I've been researching incest on the internet.
What I found, surprised me.
Did you know that first cousins can have children without great risk of birth defect or genetic disease?
That's a quote directly from the New York Times, April 4, 2002.
But despite this scientific fact, state laws on incest remain inconsistent and woefully outdated.
I mean I, I can make love to my cousin in Nebraska, but if I take her on a date in South Dakota, I'm looking at 15 years prison time.
I told the Community writers, attention must be paid.
They said they'd allow me to address it on one condition.
At the end of the episode, I must appear and identify myself as a writer.
Look, I'm not trying to tell you how to feel about incest, I'm just letting you know, there's more to it than you've been told.
I'm Briggs Haddon, and I wrote the Community season six, incest episode.
Good night.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
School's out, bitches.
Congratulations, Greendale students!
We've pulled off another year and we're still standing.
Take that, health inspector, building inspector, foundation inspector, water line inspector, geologist, exterminator, plumber, and dad.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Whoo hoo.
Abed.
Why bring a metronome?
I thought the sound might accentuate the anxious idleness of our last meeting's final seconds.
Good job, bad idea.
Okay, that is done.
Yeah!
Yay!
There's more!
This one is exciting.
We have to rename the Save Greendale committee, due to the fact that Greendale is done being saved!
You think that's more exciting than summer?
Oh, am I stealing your rays, dude?
Come on, it's neat!
Our mission is finally accomplished, once and for all, so what do we call ourselves now?
The accomplishers.
The obsoletists.
Steven King's dreamcatchers.
Susan.
You guys are rebelling against yourselves.
You get that, right?
The current trend in branding is unique, simplistic, phonetically memorable gibberish.
How about nipple dippers?
I like nipple dippers.
Yes.
You guys.
Yes.
Ooh, nippledippers.com is available.
Grab that mother.
Done.
Nipple dippers, listen up.
Text from the dean.
Don't leave yet, I'm almost there.
Special celebration.
Just finished entire semester without wearing a single silly outfit.
Oh.
I didn't even notice.
Good for him.
Oh, oh.
Hey everybody!
I made it!
Obviously, I binged pretty hard there after the bell rang but, I made it!
Are you guys going out to celebrate or something?
Maybe I'll tag along, it's been a tough year, I could use a drink.
We were gonna to Britta's bar whenever - Oh.
Mother time is willing to call it a year.
Kay fine, we're done, happy summer.
Nipple dippers drink for free!
I'll pay for my drinks, I'm not acknowledging that title.
Someone owes me ten bucks for the domain.
I won't be able to join you.
I gotta get on the road to California.
I got a job through LinkedIn.
What?
That's crazy!
People use LinkedIn?
No, LinkedIn hired me to help figure out why people don't use it.
Also, I have an old lady friend I went to high school with who just became un-married last week and I thought I'd look her up.
Wow, you work fast.
Or actually, very slow.
Either way, good luck.
Are you coming back Elroy?
I think so.
Probably, maybe.
Have a great summer.
Woah!
You guys think bars scene always have to start at a billiards shot?
Or do you think every time someone takes a shot a in billiards they start a new bar scene without knowing it?
What?
You can just say shut up Abed.
Okay, ask me if I'm coming back?
Are you coming back?
Yeah.
Probably.
Maybe.
I mean what was that, right?
That was an Irish goodbye.
Let's give it an Irish wake.
Six years guys.
Nipple dippers.
Nipple dippers.
Where's Annie?
I mean no offense to you guys but she's the only one that gets me.
She said she had an interview?
Six years.
Six seasons, right Abed?
Don't put a nickel in him.
Stop mitigating everyone.
So Abed, what happens in season seven?
Oh, man.
I don't know how likely season seven is.
I mean, what show ever peaks after season six?
Simpsons, Seinfeld, South Park, Friends.
Those shows weren't hemorrhaging characters every year.
Oh, I don't like that word, hemorrhaging.
I'll see what I can do.
What if Shirley came back, would that change your disposition?
Shirley could get us back on formula, but I don't see it turning us around.
Sorry, what's our formula?
Well, basically.
I have a placeholder so set up it, makes analogies look like punchlines.
My setup lacks awareness, but my punchline doesn't know.
Abusively cynical one liner dismissing everything you just said.
Absurd reaction.
You guys, can we put a pin in the B story and focus on the A story?
I don't trust A stories.
Never have, never will.
I had a set up about a story that was so placeholder, the punchline came five words early.
And I can tag it too.
Ooh.
I'll just take a moment to explain the risks involved in all decisions made from here until eternity.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Frankie Dart.
Is this combination gonna work?
Not my place to say.
Abed?
Lizard.
Fire hydrant.
Obama.
Shane!
You know, I put time into what I do wardrobe wise.
Yeah see, Shirley, no Shirley, what does it matter, right?
Abed, we're not formulas, and if I had no self-awareness, I think I'd know.
Things have a certain structure to them, you know?
If we stray from it, we're weird, if we stick to it, we're boring.
Yeah, but isn't that more about the shape of your brain, Abed?
I mean, no offense or anything.
But isn't the shape of your brain kinda fucked up?
Hm.
What's your season seven pitch?
My pitch for your fall semester at Greendale is that everyone is nice and has fun and grows together.
Shirley or Elroy?
See, that's racist, man.
Shirley or Elroy?
That's racist.
How about they both come back?
How about there's a whole third black person?
Where do they all sit?
They well they sit wherever they want to sit, as of the 1960s.
They sit.
They sit.
Just pitch it.
Don't pitch it.
I'm pitching it.
Guess what?
I made something.
I made a belt with fabric.
How cute is that?
Well, I think that's very cute, so oh, and I love you guys.
I've got, I'm angry and you should vote or don't vote.
Sweet!
Hallelujah!
These are good times, baby.
Good times girl, good times.
Hey, I thought of something.
You know, we should go to the to the to the, to to the market.
Yeah, we should.
Well, wouldn't that be like a thing we saw, and didn't we do that?
So shouldn't we be more ashamed and clever?
And make everything more difficult?
Yes, and I think we should be deeply sad.
And I'm nuts.
But I'm happy.
And I'm happy too.
And you know, hallelujah, and church, and singing, and street wisdom.
Stop!
Crazy, and racist, and terrible!
I agree.
You're being way too linear about this.
Shirley, Elroy, Troy, Hickey, living in the past.
Season seven don't need no past.
What are you pitching?
Don't pitch!
This is my pitch.
All right, that includes all notes and business as it pertains to the files.
How are you guys doing?
Babe, how you doing, girl?
I'm cool, it's all good.
Annie, you're looking fine.
Thank you.
Hey, what about me?
Hey everybody, look at me!
I'm ice cube head!
I've got an ice cube for a head.
I also eat cell phones, so you better be careful with those cellphones about me, because they taste like prime rib where I'm from.
Oh ho ho, boy.
Imagine the times we'll all get in together, especially when I use my powers to help solve all your problems.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, it's getting crazy in here!
All right, I'm going home.
What?
Guys, we just finished year six, and it was hard work.
And I don't really care about Greendale.
And I don't wanna spend my brief moment of humanity doing conceptual riffs, developing the imaginary TV show of our lives.
By the way, terrible improv.
Ice cube head?
You were just looking at your drink.
Busted.
Annie?
I got the internship.
I got the internship!
I'm gonna intern for the FBI.
I'll leave in a week.
I'll be in DC all summer.
You're leaving the nest.
Can I have your bedroom?
If you don't come back, if you don't come back.
Well, I'm definitely coming back, probably.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.
Okay, next order of business.
Mr. Winger, Garrett's holding Leonard's hand again.
Garrett, stop doing that.
I'm checking for a pulse.
Say, hands off the Leonard dice.
Question, when can we start the next paintball game?
I don't think he can force it.
Lots of things can be forced, like a human head through a six-inch drain pipe.
What?
Just kidding, pal.
Okay, did anyone on the sustained Greendale committee do any of their assignments this week.
Scrunch.
Sorry, bro.
I don't work for you.
You work for me.
I'm the tech billionaire that bought this dump and cuts your paycheck.
If you can call that a paycheck.
I've seen more zeroes over Pearl Harbor.
There were hundreds of them.
The sky was black with smoke bombs.
Double click this, Winger.
It's your job to work.
It is our job to party.
And hatch harebrained schemes.
And get laid.
And get laid.
And eventually leave you here as well.
Jeff, you okay?
Huh?
Oh, I, I was taken aback.
It's big news.
What have you guys been doing?
We were just looking for ways to make season seven work.
I mean we've got through six seasons.
I mean what's up with that?
Where's season seven?
I mean we gotta figure out season seven.
Or maybe we could just hang out.
Sorry I'm late.
Last night was so insane, it made the insane clown posse look like the well-adjusted clown posse.
It must be hard work running away from your own age.
Has anyone seen my e-cigarette?
There should be a charity for people like you.
Thank you.
I don't know if can keep making the commute from here to the FBI headquarters.
Britta, Abed, I'll have to move back in.
I moved in with them.
Chang, we have files.
Moving out.
You seem stressed, Annie.
Are those last few criminology credits you need hard to get at Greendale?
Please.
The only credit that it's hard to get at Greendale is from a bank.
It's just, they have schools for this kind of stuff at Quantico.
Being with you guys is great, but why is this a good choice for me?
Why doesn't the audience feel sorry for me?
Britta, your parents have been murdered.
By whom?
The police won't touch it.
They're calling it a double suicide.
Britta, I got this.
You're proposing a version of the show in which Annie comes back, and it hinges on the murder of my parents.
It's a placeholder.
I'm just saying there's always gonna be a need for law at Greendale.
You remember the ass crack bandit?
Do I remember?
I mean.
Doesn't everybody.
Could have been anybody.
What is with this diaper thing?
Is it about shaming me?
Do you really want a bunch of people dressing you?
It would be polite to try.
It's nice to see you interested in this stuff, Jeff, but I wouldn't watch that season.
Me, neither.
You wanna know a perfect season seven?
I can't count the reasons I should stay.
One by one, they all just fade away.
Well, guess what Senator?
You were allowed to call us terrorists before we moved to international waters, but we're a nation now.
So I guess this is fucking war.
Annie, I'm gonna need you to go to Washington.
I'm scared.
Be more scared than that.
Britta.
The protesters are scared.
They need you to talk to them.
They should be scared, but they shouldn't need a leader to tell them what to do.
We're all born free into a world of lies.
But let's talk about you for a second, though.
Well, I'm not a joke anymore.
I'm strictly transgender.
I'm not all this other stuff.
I represent the transgender community, and it's a real thing.
I am not crazy, but I do have flaws.
I'm smart.
All this other stuff, glad to be of service, Britta.
I want my diaper back.
I don't even own a TV and I wouldn't watch that.
Oh yeah, what's your pitch?
Oh, well I, I mean, it's not that complicated is it?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
How's everyone?
Hello.
I have.
We could learn about science or history it's set in a school, after all.
Why aren't we learning?
And I know that's not enough, so.
And so on.
Boo.
It's possible there is more skill to it than I thought.
Yes, yes, yes.
There is skill to it.
More importantly, it has to be joyful, effortless, fun.
TV defeats it's own purpose when it's pushing an agenda, or trying to defeat other TV or being proud or ashamed of itself for existing.
It's TV, it's comfort.
It's a friend you've known so well, and for so long you just let it be with you and it needs to be okay for it to have a bad day or phone in a day.
And it needs to be okay for it to get on a boat with Levar Burton and never come back.
Because eventually, it all will.
I'm fine.
I know.
It's not just that.
It's just such a classic mistake but.
I got really attached to my pitch.
I had a sound track in my head and everything.
Well I agree with Abed.
And I have an effortless pitch.
Mm.
So, how's this semesters crop of apples looking?
Britta's been out rotting.
Asian kid in my math class, doesn't want to study because he doesn't want to be a stereotype.
It's pretty funny.
Sounds like a strong B story.
And I can say that without throwing anyone because I teach TV appreciation.
Chang you can send that student to me and we'll make it more serious.
I'm the school shrink I can wear these glasses every episode.
You are super hot in them.
Yeah.
Very hot.
Mm-hm.
This gives me a more solid reason to interact with you than a stupid committee.
By the way I'm a lesbian.
That's why I haven't hit on Jeff.
Mm.
Here's my deal, I teach criminology.
But look, it's the original Annie.
But I'm grown up and I'm hot, but not little girl hot.
And I'm happy and we're all together and it makes sense.
We just might live the good life yet.
Hi!
Dean!
Dean, I told you not to come into the teachers lounge, you're supposed to be in dean class.
How can I learn to be dean if I can't hang out with teachers?
We're supposed to be shaping minds, but we keep shaping each other.
Bring it in.
In this version, will you tell me what to do a lot?
Am I on meds in it?
I'm mellow and relatable.
I like it.
I would love to teach at Greendale, and I do miss wearing skirts.
Why don't you shallow a horse pill size contrivance, it would open up new areas and dynamics.
And it's evergreen.
Well great that's settled.
How do we make it real?
Annie, maybe you should start looking into education classes.
You too, Abed.
Well, I should probably tell you guys that I'm moving to Los Angeles.
What?
Yeah, like a real TV executive I was letting you guys work your ass off, because there's no profit in saying no to an idea, but now that it's time for me to commit I have to pass.
I got a job as a PA on a Fox show, it's in a video game studio.
It's like 30 Rock, meets IT Crowd, meets, well me, I'm growin' up That's so great Abed.
Congratulations Abed.
I'm so happy for you.
But you're coming back right?
Maybe.
Probably.
Maybe.
That's six seasons and a movie.
Jeff I know it comforts you to look at things through that metal lens, but this is reality.
TV's rules aren't based on common sense.
They're based on the studio wanting to milk their properties dry.
Here here.
Cheers to that and cheers to Abed.
Cheers!
What, Jeffrey?
Hey.
And so on.
Annie I'm home.
Hey there.
How was your day?
Did anything funny happen?
Who cares.
How was your day?
Good.
Sebastian did some drawing.
Sebastian?
Let's look at them.
Sebastian.
Sebastian.
Back to your child area.
Aw.
I love you.
Are you okay?
Is this really what you want?
Of course.
I mean, I'd be fine with a dog too.
But, whatever you want.
Do you have any idea what I want?
Yes.
How'd you get in here?
I pulled the spare key so the dean would stop leaving them under the welcome mat.
You left weirdly.
Well, there's no normal way to do anything now.
Yeah.
You're gonna be fine, you know.
I don't wanna be fine.
I wanna be 25 and heading out into the world.
I wanna fall asleep on a beach and be able to walk the next day, or stay up all night on accident.
I wanna wear a t-shirt without looking like I forgot to get dressed.
I want to be terrified of AIDS, I want to have an opinion about those, boring ass Marvel movies.
And I want those opinions to be of any concern to the people making them.
Well I want to live in the same home for more than a year, order wine without feeling nervous, have a resume full of crazy mistakes instead of crazy lies.
I want stories and wisdom, perspective.
I wanna have so much behind me I'm not a slave to what's in front of me, especially these flavorless unremarkable Marvel movie.
They are so not a big deal!
I know!
It's just all there is!
Yes, and you get to say that!
I could screw myself if I say it, but there's pressures on me you don't have to live under, if you accept that you're older.
And let the kid stuff go.
I let you go, Annie.
From my hands and my head.
The heart, which cynics say is code for penis, wants what it wants.
But I let you go.
The others are coming.
I think you should kiss me goodbye or you might regret it for the rest of your life.
What about you?
Oh, I'll regret the kiss for a week, I'm in my 20s.
Who cares?
Are we interrupting?
Stop being gross!
Are you guys doing an unauthorized finale in here?
Not cool.
Abed, I know it gives you comfort to see everything through that metal lens, but we were just saying goodbye to the room.
For season six.
Season seven, who knows?
It's out of our hands.
Too many variables.
Cool.
Cool, cool.
Cool, cool.
Cool.
That was one cool for each season.
Wait, do it again.
I want to try something.
Cool.
Cool, cool.
Cool.
Oh.
Cool, cool.
I farted during the fourth one.
It's an inside joke.
I'm gonna miss you guys.
Gay.
You know what I think everybody should do, as a humble outsider that came in and nailed it?
I think everyone should imagine their own personal version of season seven and not share it with anyone.
And then maybe it'll come true.
No cutting to any of them.
If you cut to it, it won't come true.
You just stopped being a study group.
I hereby pronounce you a community.
Brianna, you're the driven idealist.
Kaylee, you're the fiery passionate one.
We might have a fun no strings and Mackenzie, the kooky nerdy one, and Hailey, the other nerdy one!
You guys should be best friends and have pillow fights.
And there's Phoebe, the wise one.
No?
You're nerdy too?
Okay, and the rest of you are the redhead ones.
And we're gonna have some pretty crazy times, and eventually you'll leave and be replaced by new ones.
And that's something I'm equipped to handle now.
I'm sort of the hero that way.
We can cut to them at home though, right?
I mean by ourselves?
Sure.
I love that I got to be with you guys.
Gay.
You saved my life, and changed it forever.
Gay!
Thank you.
I'm gay.
I'm for real gay.
I'm legit gay!
Oh, there's a river that winds on forever I'm gonna see where it leads.
Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted I'm gonna stand on the peak.
Out there's a land that time don't command.
Wanna be the first to arrive.
No time for ponderin' why I'm a-wanderin.
Nowhere the buses lay.
To the ends, to the ends would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for us to see.
To the ends of the earth would you follow me?
This is the show.
Right, that's right.
Community!
The hit show is now a hit board game.
More like an I'm bored game.
Shut up, Leonard.
You look like a German puppet maker and smell like the inside of a church.
Blah, blah, blah commercial video describing the rules of gameplay.
I like you, Leonard.
As a friend.
Ooh.
Sorry Britta, but that friendship just got a benefit.
Collect all the other players' identities and be the first to figure out if the game is part of the show or, I got it.
The whole show is happening inside this game.
Then explain this.
What is it?
It's a script of a fake commercial at the end of season six, starring this family.
Sorry, dad.
Guess I win.
You stupid child.
Nobody's winning anything.
Don't you see?
This means we don't exist.
We're not created by God, we're created by a joke.
We were never born, and we will never actually live.
