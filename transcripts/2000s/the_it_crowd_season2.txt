{START OF EPISODE 1}
1 I've just won 450 grand playing poker!
Well done!
I saw that one coming, Mickey73!
That's my rent sorted this month!
And I can buy that new Oh, no, I've lost it all again Philip!
Hello, hi.
This is Philip, from sixth.
This is Moss, this is Roy.
- Hi.
- Hiya.
So, what brings you to my lair?
Not that I'm some sort of animal!
Or maybe I am Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!
I was just wondering if you had the latest Heat?
Yes, yes.
There it is.
Thanks.
Sorry about this.
I don't suppose, maybe you'd like to come to theatre tomorrow night, maybe, or I'd be delighted!
- He means me, Moss.
- He was looking at me.
No, he wasn't.
I think he was!
You're not even in his eye line!
Philip, who were you talking to?
Me or Jen?
- Do you like the theatre?
- Never been!
But I've always liked the idea of the theatre.
The smell of the grease, the roar of the paint!
I've often thought if I hadn't ended up in computers, I would've gone into the theatre.
But you've never been to see a play?
- No.
- Why not?
Never had the interest.
Are there any famous people in it?
It's a pass for me then, thank you.
- You haven't been invited anyways.
- Wait Laura Nightly's in it.
Laura Nightly from The Build?
There's no invitation!
Show me the invitation I guess you guys could come too if you wanted.
I know people in the show, tickets won't be a problem.
Great!
That's settled then.
Great!
I will give you a call and then give you the details.
How's that?
That is perfect in itself, Philip!
Thanks for coming down, man!
Catch you later!
That could have been a date, there Now, it's a work outing!
Sorry!
I forgot the Heat!
It's it's What?
He actually did want to borrow the copy of Heat.
- So?
- Well, it's just you know - No, I don't.
What?
- I'm just surprised.
Why?
It's just I don't know many heterosexual men who read Heat.
What?
He's gay just because he reads Heat magazine?
Well, he's either gay or a woman in her early twenties.
Why else would he ask me out on a date?
Are you sure he meant it as a date "date"?
Are you sure you're not going along as his gal pal?
If you're talking about who I think you're talking about, then the answer is yes, he is gay.
How do you know?
Everyone knows.
And once more, he's been gay, since Wham.
We were talking about Philip!
He borrowed Heat.
He borrowed Heat?
And he knows people in the theatre.
That's not a euphemism.
He actually does know people in the theatre.
Anyway, it's a date.
I'm sure it is.
Why else would he ask me out?
Well, don't take this the wrong way, but could he have thought you were a man?
- Let's get a taxi.
- It's a ten minute walk.
No.
I don't like walking.
Why do you just not come, then you wouldn't have to walk anywhere?
I won't spoil your romantic evening with the gay man.
He's not a gay man!
He reads Heat!
Hey, where are you lot off to?
Look!
Richmond's still alive!
We're going to the theatre.
Do you wanna come?
No, thanks.
And you shouldn't go either.
Why not?
A new wind is blowing!
Last night, I was stood from my slumber by a crow calling three times.
Well, you know what a crow sounds like.
Passing to my window, I trod on a piece of Lego.
Oh, it went right in the heel!
Turning on my television set, I noticed the reception wasn't great.
Not terrible, just not great.
Hear me well!
No good can come of your trip to the theatre tonight!
No good at all!
And if you ask me That's just bloody rude!
Where is my Heat?
A gay musical, called "Gay".
That's quite gay Gay musical?
Aren't all musicals gay?
This must be like the gayest musical ever made!
It's got some pretty good reviews!
"The story of a young man trying to find his sexuality "in the uncaring Thatcher years.
"Warning.
Includes scenes of graphic homo eroticism".
It's set in the 80's!
Graphic homo eroticism?
Are they gonna get them out?
You're not comfortable with your sexuality?
I'm comfortable with my sexuality.
I don't wanna be slapped in the face with their sexuality.
Look!
There is Philip!
Look!
He's leching at that lady!
Thank God for that!
He's just an ordinary ignored man!
Hey!
You're already here!
What are we doing, Roy?
This isn't us.
It takes place in the past!
Forget the play.
Philip knows the cast!
It's all about the backstage party afterwards.
Those things are great.
You go to them telling they were brilliant and it's free wine all night.
Besides, I really wanna meet Laura Nightly.
Hey there, guys!
It's great, isn't it?
Great.
We should really pick up our tickets.
I know someone who gets the tickle!
Sorry, I love doing that to him!
This is Jerome.
He does publicity for the show.
He got us our tickets.
Great, thanks.
This is Jen, and Moss and Roy.
How is it going?
My God, you're Irish!
I love Irish people!
They're just mad, aren't they?
They're just mad!
We're all insane, yeah.
You'll love this!
It's great crack!
I'm mad for crack!
Quick everyone!
The show's about to start!
I hope Laura Nightly isn't gonna be dressed up like toyer or something.
- Who is she in The Build again?
- She plays that heroin addict - who gets stabbed in the face?
- She is lovely.
Isn't she lovely?
Oh God, here we go.
It might be right.
How bad can it be?
Welcome to the United Queendom!
Brilliant!
United Queendom!
He can't say that, can he?
Check that asses!
I'm a friend of Dorothy!
I'm a friend of Dorothy!
She is my friend!
This is insanely brilliant!
Hold my hand No, that's not my hand!
I love willies!
Okay, I'm completely satisfied!
Don't leave!
It's rude!
It's too gay for me.
I thought I could handle it, but I can't.
There'll be the interval soon.
I'm captivated, Roy.
Calm down.
At least, it can't get any worse.
All right, get them houselights up and let's have a look at you!
Are you wearing that shirt for a bet?
Audience participation!
Go, go!
What have we - here!
- Hello!
Tell me!
Who wears the trousers in this relationship?
What?
Oh, no.
We're not homosexuals.
We're just very good friends.
So, you never had a look?
- At what?
- His bum!
I've seen it, when he thrusts it in front of my desk, or, should he bend over to pick something up.
I'd love to work in that office There's nothing sexual going on.
I do like Roy, but I'm not "curious".
What were you engaging him for?
He was asking me questions, I couldn't just ignore him.
It's a bit rude, Roy.
So what do you think of it?
I think it's fabulous.
Every value I've ever held is being questioned, and I'm loving it.
You don't like it, do you?
The songs are good.
No, they're not!
Hum one of the songs.
Willies, willies!
I like willies!
It's "I love willies".
- I love willies!
- Sir, could you keep it down?
- I'm not going back in there!
- Oh yes, you are!
No.
I'll wait out here for you, but there's no way I'm going anywhere near that thing.
You can't leave me alone in there.
I don't know what the hell is going on!
He's laughing like an idiot at every single gay reference!
- Why didn't he come off for a drink?
- He doesn't wanna miss anything!
I need to wee wee.
Yeah, me too.
- What's wrong?
- They've got a toilet guy.
I hate toilet guys!
Let's just get over with.
Thank you.
Cheers, dude.
- Did you go?
- No.
Did you?
No!
How could I?
Block stood looking at us!
What was that?
It's not my fault he works in a toilet!
- How much did you give him?
- A pound.
I just paid a pound not to go to the toilet.
He's a terrible toilet guy!
He should work where people don't want to go to the toilet.
I'll use the disabled.
- You can't use the disabled!
- What?
Why not?
You're not disabled!
You'll get in trouble!
It's not like a parking space, Moss.
I think.
I think it's okay, isn't it?
It's okay.
I'm always using the disabled.
It's illegal!
I don't think so.
Hello?
Hello?
You all right in there?
Do you need help?
I'm disabled!
He sounds disoriented.
Move back - from the door!
- What?
No!
- What are you doing?

Someone's had an accident.
Well, you'd better keep going then.

This is a staff toilet!
Yes I'm staff!
I really am feeling much better.

Do you need any help getting home?
No, I'm fine, I'm with people.

It's the least I can do.
Okay Are you slacking off in there?
Go and get changed!
Excuse me, sir.
Can I have a word?
Amazing!
Super powerful!
Thanks.
That The grit of it!
Five stars!
So what did you think?
- Of the musical?
- Did you not just love it?
Well, no, - sorry.
- Why not?
I don't know, just Maybe, you have to be gay.
I loved it!
I guess it's more of a gay thing.
You know, you have to be gay.
A gay man.
A homosexual.
But all I know is I loved every last second of it.
And I'm not usually a fan of musicals.
Do you want to meet the cast?
Come on!
The thing is I have to meet Moss and Roy.
Listen, I told the cast about what happened, and they told me to get you all to come back and meet them!
Come on everybody!
Off the van!
Hey, James!
Wow, Edgar!
Hi!
Brilliant!
Jeremy!
How do you know all these young good looking men?
You know, just from my route.
Hey, Jerome!
Come here, you!
Great show.
Hello, darling!
Listen, I can't talk at the moment.
The disabled are coming for a chat.
Here they are now.
He's had quite an evening.
Someone stole his wheelchair.
Really?
Did you see who it was?
Red bearded man.
How long have you been disabled?
- Ten years.
- Ten years!
And how did it happen, if that's not a rude question?
Acid.
What are the chances of that happening?
A hundred to one.
You're like you could do with a drink.
Whisky Please.
Double.
- Excuse me?
- Yes, miss?
Can I have a double whisky, please?
Double whisky.
And a glass of white wine.
A glass of white wine.
You're very welcome, madam.
- Hello, Laura Nightly.
- How are you?
I'm disabled!
It must be so difficult being gay and disabled.
Very difficult.
Come here, my little soldier.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
- You're from telly!
- I am.
And you know, a little birdy told me that you couldn't make the show tonight.
So, I've got you two tickets for tomorrow.
Brilliant!
- You're doing so well!
- Yeah.
- High five!
- High five!
A couple of photos?

What What's I get it!
Very funny, you Irish!
I'm a bit tired!
Can I have a wheelchair too?
Hilarious!
Me legs don't work!
Help, pal!
I need a wheelchair!
Come on, get out!
Come on!
Stop buzzing around, all right, Gary?
Well, I guess this is good night.
For God sake, are you gay?
Are you a gay man?
- Are you?
- No!
So brilliant, dude!
That's 'Cause that's all I wanted to know.
I don't mind, one way or another, you know.
It's just I like being clear.
I don't want any ambiguity.
What on earth made you think I was gay?
Well, you know I didn't just pull it out of the air.
You know, you just brought me to a gay musical called "Gay", You've been laughing like mad at every at every gay reference.
Your friends, more of whom are gay, say hello by tickling you!
In what century are you living in?
Do you think that a man has to be gay to like a gay musical?
Can a straight man not have homosexual friends?
And since when was tickling gay?
I missed that meaning, Jen!
- Come here.
- I'm sorry, I guess you astray me when you borrowed that copy of Heat.
Oh God, it's true, it's true, I'm gay!
I'm a gay man!
I tried to run from it tonight but I can't, I can't!
Jen, what am I gonna do?
I thought I could make it work between us, because you looked a bit like a man!
Taxi!
Hello, there.
I didn't see you on the way out.
All right, lads!
Let's get a sing song coming!
It's a long way back to Manchester!
- 'Night, Steve.
- 'Night, Moss.
- 'Night Melly, you be good!
- Mind if I can't help it.
Ah, the theatre
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Which means, which means a profit so far this year of - 1,800 billion billions.
- Splendid!
This doesn't even include the added revenue arising for your take over of ITV!
ITV?
I'd forgotten about ITV.
Brilliant!
Gentleman, when I first started Reynholm Industries, I had just two things in my possession: a dream and 6 million pounds.
Today, I have a business empire, the like of which the world has never seen the like of which.
Hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the world!
Gentleman, to the future.
Oh, you don't have any glasses.
Just pretend.
- To the future!
- To the future!
Sorry to interrupt but there are some policemen here, they say they need to speak to you about irregularities in the pension fund.
I see.
Could you make me a cup of tea, please, Stephanie?
Earlier that day  Nice.
- Isn't she a beauty?
- It's certainly a phone.
160 PPI screen.
- Wi-Fi enables - Ask me what kind of phone I've got.
- What kind of phone have you got?
- It doesn't matter.
Voice recognition.
So let's say I wanted to call my mum, I just have to say "mum", and it calls her.
I don't need to do anything.
It's the dog's bollocks.
Mum, mum, no No, I'm sorry.
No, Moss said that.
Yeah, okay, I'll call you later, bye.
Only problem with it is that it's got a very weedy vibrate setting.
I mean, watch this.
I mean, what is that?
- I'll sort it out.
- Oh, could you?
Just you know, welly up the vibrator a bit.
Okay, all right.
Now, will you answer this question?
Are we still on this?
You keep interrupting!
We would've been done ages ago, - but you - All right, go on.
Question 39.
When was the last time you exercise?
The last time I exercised was never.
I'm still reeling from your answer to question 12.
What was question 12?
You brush your teeth in the bath.
- So?
- That's where your balls are.
Okay, question 40.
Do you get your five fruit and veg?
I mean, I certainly try to I would say I probably do.
- A day.
- A what?
You're going to love this.
This website takes all the information you gave me and guess what it does?
It actually estimates the date of your death!
- What?
- I know.
- Unbelievable, isn't it?
- What?
Wait a second.
I know about those!
Everyone knows about those!
All right, so you've already done it.
So, when's the big day?
I haven't done it!
Why would I want to do it?
- I get March 2nd 2079.
- Oh, my God!
That's right, baby!
I've got 70 more years!
Okay, Moss, close that window!
- I do not wanna know!
- But I've written it all in now.
I do not wanna know the date of my death.
Close it.
Hello, IT, have you tried turning it off and You know, I'm sick of saying that.
What do you want?
Okay, yeah, someone will be up in a minute.
Maybe.
You looked!
You know!
You know when I'm going to die!
I do, yes.
- I told you not to look!
- I made a mistake.
When is it?
- You don't wanna know.
- You can't say that to me now!
My advice, Roy, is to forget all about this.
What, how long more they've given me, 20 years?
It's less than twenty?
You see, I don't think this is taking into account leap years.
So that could well be something to hang on to.
What does it say, Moss?
Does it say I'm already dead?
- No, that would be terrible.
- Thank God.
- It's Thursday.
- What?
- It's Thursday.
- Thursday?
Again, remember, leap years.
It's Thursday!
Thursday the 3rd!
Although, not too late after noon, so that gives you most of the day.
What?
3 p.m.!
- How could they be that specific?
- Yeah, it's silly.
These things are, at best, 79% accurate.
Oh, good.
I would take no further notice of it.
Yeah, you're right, it's silly.
I will take no further notice of it.
Apparently, there's something wrong with all the computers on 7th.
Who wants it?
You look terrible.
Are you ill?
I don't know.
These idiots disabled the flipping firewall!
Yeah, hello, excuse me.
Thank you, some attention please.
I know you don't think it's "important" or "cool" but there is a ruddy good reason why we put up anti-virus software and firewalls.
It's because there are a lot of dangerous things out there.
Jesus!
You know, calm down.
Just don't disable the firewalls.
Okay, 73', that's good, that's good.
And mum, what age did Uncle Tony die?
32?
It was a car accident?
Brilliant!
Okay, no, I completely forgot Okay.
Mum, I have to go.
Unbelievable, some brainiac disabled his firewall which means that all the computers on floor 7 are teeming with viruses.
Plus, I've just had to walk all the way down the mother fudging stairs because the lift is broken, again.
Oh, my God.
- What?
- Oh, my God.
What?
What it is?
Denholm is dead.
Oh, yes, and Denholm is dead.
Okay, everyone ready?
You look great.
We should go to more funerals.
Yeah, except, is there any chance I could - not go to this one?
- No, why?
It's just, you know, funerals.
So morbid.
Would you please forget this website nonsense?
You are not going to die.
Come on, cheer up!
You're gonna ruin the funeral.
Yeah, you're right.
Pay no attention to me.
I'm being an idiot.
Dead man walking!
Very funny.
You crazy little bastard!
When did you last exercise, Jen?
No, you are not going to do it to me.
- Scared?
- No.
I happen to think I have a good few years left.
I take plenty of exercise and I haven't smoked for 3 years.
I didn't know you smoked.
I was on 40 a day by the end.
40 a day, that's 146,002 a decade.
Presuming at least two leap years.
How the flip do you give up?
Basically, pure self-control, Moss.
No, I'd never smoke again.
I'd rather lick a tramp.
Derek, Hello.
Hello, Jen.
Thanks for printing out those funeral announcements.
Oh, no, I enjoyed doing it.
You know, in a sad way.
- Can I have a word, please?
- Sure.
Hey, oh, my phone.
Oh cool, have you souped up?
Yeah, I totally pimped your phone, girlfriend.
What set are you setting?
That is the lowest setting.
It shall come as no surprise to you that I don't like this department.
Never have, never will.
I see no need for an IT department, I would much rather use this basement for something important.
Like a big toilet!
I have to say that actually, it's a bit of a surprise.
- Really?
I did send out a memo.
- I didn't get it.
- I had no idea you felt like this.
- Well, I do.
However, I am prepared to give you another chance.
Another chance?
But I didn't know we'd already had a chance.
This should be the first chance.
You should give us this chance.
And then, another chance.
OK, I'll get it!
Give me a go!
I got to put it up to 5.
I'm gonna put it in my pocket!
Put it up to 8!
Put it up to 8!
I'm not gonna put it up to 8, Moss!
It'll blow my cock off.
- Come on, come on.
Put it up!
- Okay, I'll put it up.
You do know we are burying a great man today!
Did someone else die?
I mean Mr. Reynholm!
"Did someone else die"?
Oh, I didn't know.
You have to be careful, he's our new boss.
He hates us, he keeps saying that there's no need - for an IT department.
- Why didn't anyone tell me this?
There was a memo.
It just said: "I hate the IT Department".
Oh, no, no, no!
No, you are not coming to the funeral, Richmond!
What funeral?
- Has anyone got the right time?
- It's twenty to three.
I'll make it a quarter to.
Why?
Oh, yes!
Because that website said you were going to die at 3pm, didn't it?
- Did it?
I can't remember.
- How could you forget?
It clearly stated that you were going to die, today.
At precisely 3:00.
Unless, it was tomorrow.
But no, it's today, at 3:00.
Well, would you put it out of your mind?
Right, you're right, out of my mind.
Okay, there's Denholm's wife.
I never know what to say to people at funeral.
Neither do I. I'm terrible.
Oh, just say "I'm sorry for your lost", then move on.
- He'll be in our prayers.
- Thank you.
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.
Move on.
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.
It's not like you've lost a pen, is it?
It's so much worse.
Would you like a pen?
- I have this spare one.
- Oh, no, thank you.
- Please, take it.
- Why are you giving it to me?
I don't know.
Swings and roundabouts!
Death!
Death is coming!
Death is here Death is outside There's no escape.
I don't like the way Derek's looking at us.
Who's that knocking at the door?
Yes It's death!
Yet it'd be.
Is this normal?
Death came for Denholm just as it will come for you.
Who will be next?
You?
Maybe you - We are gathered here to - What's wrong with you?
- past of a great man.
- Nothing.
A man like us.
I've never seen a grand-father clock in a church before.
Yet, the one was a second hand.
Yes, he had more money than most of us here today.
But did that make him a better man?
We know Denholm was a man of money.
Yes, he had more money than any of us here.
Oh, no!
Jesus!
Jesus Christ!
Holy!
Call me an ambulance!
I'm not f joking!
And get an ambulance!
I'm not f joking!
Call me a f ambulance!
Oh, no, wait That's my phone!
I think that It's Let's see if I can't leave it.
I can't leave it.
I'll turn it off.
I've just been set up.
Oh, God f!
Go on!
Oh, it's gone to message.
Hey, Roy, nothing important!
Just wondering how the funeral went.
Call me back.
If we are all quite ready, Denholm instructed that this short film be played before the service.
You're all out of there!
You are out of there!
You're history!
If you're watching this, it means I'm dead, now.
And it's all thanks to these little things.
- Wrong!
- Shut up!
Cigarettes have finally killed me.
Like they killed my father, my father's father, my mother's father, my mother, and her father.
I just can't seem to give the damn things up.
I love them!
Sweet smoky cigarettes.
You delicious bastards!
Final clause, Stephanie, could you categorise the personel files alphabetically from now on?
That rhyming thing, this isn't working.
Also call Who's Who and get them to update my entry.
Well, thanks everyone for coming!
Enjoy the rest of the funeral.
Well said, sir!
I will now ask Mr. Pippin to read the eulogy.
I see a lot of faces out there.
Some of you I know, some of you I hope to get to know better over the coming months.
Some of you I probably won't be seeing very much off, after today!
The reading of the eulogy is a duty normally left to the eldest child.
But, as you all know, Denholm's son Douglas mysteriously disappeared after a lengthy court case, 7 years ago.
Let me start by reading this poem that I saw in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral.
"Stop all the clocks".
Father!
- Tits!
- We're just a small church.
Unhappy priest!
Where is your God?
Where is your God now!
Here lies a great man!
A great man!
Father!
- Did I miss anything?
- They just started Denholm's eulogy.
You stink!
I just smoked a cigarette from a drain.
Well, who's this?
- Hi, I'm Douglas.
- Jen Barber.
Beautiful second name!
What're you doing after the funeral?
- Douglas!
- Speak, priest!
No, I'm a vic Your father prepared a second tape - in the event of your sudden arrival.
- A second tape?
I see - Actually, I don't follow.
- I'll just put in on.
Hello again.
If you're watching this, it's because my son from my 1st marriage has arrived, caused a scene, and is currently chatting up some nearby trull.
Quiet, woman!
I have something important to tell you.
I'm here, papa!
Reynholm Industries is now yours.
- My Lord, thank you father.
- But it's yours at a price.
I want you to promise me now, in front of all your new employees, that you will never again become embroiled in a sexual harassment case - that dangers the company.
- I promise, father.
There's one more thing, but it's for your ears only.
So, I want you to stop the tape, take it home, - and watch it again later in private.
- But these are my new family.
I have no secrets from them!
OK, Douglas.
Now we're alone, I can speak frankly.
You may receive a visit from the police at some point concerning irregularities in the pension fund.
Turn that off.
I've been using a very creative accountant recently released from jail - to manage what I call the suck fund!
- Where is the remote?
- Now, the suck fund - I'll do it myself!
Good bye, father!
Right, I'm off.
I'll see you all on Monday.
Douglas!
Sorry, I didn't mean to.
Derek Pippin!
I worked very closely with your father.
Derek, good to meet you.
I'm afraid I'll be bringing in my own people, so you're immediately fired.
Okay, good luck everyone, and I'll see you later.
- and you are ready to go!
- Brilliant!
Thank you, computer man!
I'm told my father was particularly proud of the IT department.
Run by a dynamic go-getter, a genius, and a man from Ireland!
One last thing.
How do I erase files like this one here, marked pensions?
- Just like this.
- All gone!
Wonderful.
Thanks, guys.
I'll be working very closely with your department.
And I have a feeling I'll be needing you for a lot more than just deleting incriminating files.
I just mean files.
- OK, we'd better be off.
- By the way Where's that ootsie-tootsie humdinging-coochie mama-boss of yours?
She went home early.
She said she had some catching up to do.
One last thing.
I sorted out this for you.
Now, I'm afraid the vibrate setting is still a little weedy.
So, you may wanna put it all the way up to ten.
Ten!
Shall I do done and done!
Sorry about this, old man!
Now, I like that!
Nearly at the station!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
You wouldn't steal a handbag.
You wouldn't steal a car.
You wouldn't steal a baby.
You wouldn't shoot a policeman and then steal his helmet.
You wouldn't go to the toilet in his helmet And then send it to the policeman's grieving widow And then steal it again!
Downloading films is stealing.
If you do it, you will face the consequences.
Man, these anti-piracy ads are getting really mean.
I think we're sitting too close to the screen.
- The floor's all sticky over here.
- Allright, let's move back then.
- I still think we're too close.
- Well, then sit in the sink.
I'm not sitting in the sink again.
OK, princess.
Your flat is way too small for this telly That's fantastic.
- What's wrong, now?
- I need to go to the toilet.
Well, then go.
I'll hold it in.
- Hello?
- Hello, Roy.
- Hello, Jeff.
- No, Roy, you know I changed my name by deed poll - I'm not calling you Dominator.
- But I am Dominator!
- Whatever.
I'm not calling you it.
- Forget it.
Now listen, I was just wondering, have you seen the new Tarantino film?
- I'm just about to watch it, Jeff.
- I have already seen it!
Anyway, at the end, there's a very unusual twist.
Now I know there's a twist.
I'm gonna spend the whole film guessing what it is.
Damn you, Dominator.
- Just try and forget there's a twist.
- How can you forget there's a twist?
What's wrong with it now?
Come on.
If I don't see this film today, Jeff'll find out some way of telling me what the twist is, I know he will.
Come on!
Work!
Look, I have to go.
Moss?
- What's up with you?
- I can't do this anymore!
Do what?
What are you talking about?
Let me help - Back off.
- We're just watching the film, Moss.
- Come on, can't you see it?
- See what, Moss?
We go to a film, sometimes the pub, maybe get some dinner, but it just goes on and on, year in, year out.
We're stagnating!
You make it sound like we're an old married couple.
But we are.
Can't you see?
You're my wife, Roy!
You're my wife.
My wife!
We should have married ladies but we married each other.
- You're my wife!
- Stop calling me your wife.
You're my wife, Roy, and I can't take it any more.
If anything, I'm the husband.
What's this?
What's this?
- Come on.
- We don't even have ventilation here.
- I'll stand over here.
- I don't care.
I don't wanna go out on the street.
It's too Soviet out there.
- Soviet?
- Yes.
It's cold, everyone looks oppressed.
You know, I remember when smoking was fun.
All the cool kids were doing it.
Every time I want a cigarette now I have to go to Gorky Park.
- Don't answer that!
- Why?
I know who it is.
It's a man called Dominator who wants to tell me the twist in a film I've been waiting to see for ages.
- Don't answer it.
- Dominator?
- His name is Jeff Hawthorne.
- We must answer the phone.
No, we don't.
Look, he'll give up in a second.
I know Jeff.
He'll need to go to the toilet in about another 2 rings.
- We're answering the phone.
- We are not answering the phones.
- You all right, Moss?
- I've got the blues, Jen.
Why?
Well, Roy and I are becoming like an old married couple.
Will you please stop saying that?
And I'm the husband!
We just seem to do the same thing day in, day out.
I'm stagnating, Jen, like a packet of crisps on the roof.
It seems to me the problem is that you two spend too much time together.
You should get out there meet other people.
Other people?
Yes.
You mean people other than Roy?
Well, yes.
And these "other people", where do they congregate?
I don't know, you could do an evening class or something.
Hold on a second.
What exactly am I supposed to do while she's out gallivanting at her night classes and whatnot?
You could meet other people as well.
Yeah.
I don't like people.
Well, now that's not fair, Roy.
Have you met all of them?
I've met enough of them.
People!
What a bunch of bastards!
Stephanie?
Yes, hello.
Of course OK.
Bye.
I'm off.
- Douglas is coming down.
- Douglas?
Why?
Well, to be honest with you, he's been making advances.
You know, things like asking me if I wanna go for a ride in his helicopter.
- I wanna go for a ride in a helicopter.
- Well, grow a pair of tits.
Tell you what, if I did have tits, I wouldn't mind letting someone have a go on them for a ride in a helicopter.
Look who it is, everyone.
It's only me.
Jen, do you have a moment?
No, I'm very busy.
I don't wanna go for a ride in a helicopter.
- That wasn't what I was gonna ask.
- What d'you want, then?
Something work-related?
- What department is this?
- Sorry?
If it's work-related, obviously, you'll know what department this is.
What department is this?
Some sort of homosexual department?
It's IT!
IT.
I knew that, yes.
That's what I wanted, actually.
You see, my computer's broken and I need someone to fix it.
Roy's your man.
How do you fellas get any work done with a hot piece of finger-licking chicken like that?
Me?
I'd be a 24-hour tripod.
Watch this, it looks good.
I've actually been looking forward to seeing this.
Yeah?
You wanna come round to mine?
We can watch it there.
I gotta pretty nifty home cinema system.
Mine is broken but I think that maybe I'll just watch it Excellent, that's settled!
Seven o'clock tonight.
I'll get my PA to phone you with my name and address.
Whoa, there.
That's not my office.
Well, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
And I'm the gander!
I hear the ballet in Prague is excellent this season.
- Hello, Yorg.
- Hello, Jen.
Terrible isn't it?
Every year it gets worse.
First they take away our smoking room, then they push us outside.
I wonder when they will decide to get it over with and kill us.
Yorg Such a pessimist.
- Has he gone?
- Has who gone?
Bruce Wayne.
He's long gone, although Roy's got a man date with him.
It is not a man date.
I am not a man-woman, we are not married, I am not your wife!
You'd willingly spend time with Douglas?
I really have to see this film soon.
By the way, I took your advice about those evening classes.
- I'm gonna learn how to cook.
- Oh, I'm so pleased, Moss!
And I have to say women do love a cook.
Well, answered an ad online.
This time next month, when you want German cuisine, I'm your man.
German cuisine?
Is German cuisine not good?
No.
Sounds fine.
There's nothing more romantic than a glass of wine and some Schweinefleisch.
Good, because usually when I try something new it ends up a disaster.
I got a reply to my advertisement.
Maurice Moss.
He sounds delicious!
Guten Abend.
I mean hello.
- Hello.
I'm Moss.
- Yes, yes.
I'm Johann.
Come in, come in.
Nice TV.
Good distance from the sofa.
Would you like a drink?
White Russian, please.
I don't know that.
How do you make that?
I don't know.
We might as well get to it.
Really?
Gosh.
So eager, so brave.
Well, once I've made up my mind to do something, that's it.
That's very admirable.
So just do whatever you want with me, I'm ready for anything.
Well, right!
I will I suppose Take your clothes off, - and we'll get started.
- Right.
- So how long does this course last?
- Sorry?
- How long does this course last?
- Course, what course?
- Hang on, take my clothes off?
- Yes.
- Sorry.
I'm confused.
- Well, so am I. What did you think this was?
Well, I was going to eat you.
I may have misheard you there.
Did you just say that you were going to eat me?
- Right, you did say that.
- Yes.
- Yeah, no, I'm here for the cookery.
- No, this is the cookery.
Look, I've got your advert here.
I printed it out.
"I want to cook with you".
No, my English is not so good You want to cook with me, using me, you mean.
Ah yes!
Yes.
You see.
I see where the confusion was.
I thought this was a cookery course.
But you wanted someone who would agree to let you kill and eat them.
Ja!
You see?
That is funny.
So you're not interested?
No, thanks, it's not for me.
How disappointing.
I'm sorry, Johann, this must be such a let down.
Had my tonsils out last month, I could have kept them.
I feel like such a turnip.
- Do you want to watch a film?
- OK.
- I have Ocean's Eleven.
- Original or remake?
Well, yeah, you could come over here, we could put on some music, I could give you a back rub, see what happens.
Oh, no, wait, I've got this guy coming over to watch a DVD.
Another time, maybe.
OK.
And some chicken wings, please.
Thank you.
There's somebody at the door!
There's somebody at the door!
There's somebody at the door!
Hey, it's my G!
I'm really sorry I was late.
It was It's cool.
You know, we should do this sort of thing more often.
I hate the whole boss/employee thing, don't you?
Yeah.
You wanna seal the deal with a high 5?
Yes.
So, what are we watching?
It's a Tarantino produced, South Korean zombie movie.
I didn't know there was a South Korea.
OK, put it on.
I've ordered pizza and chicken wings and there's a cooler beside you, - so help yourself to beer.
- Don't mind if I do?
I've heard of this flick.
There's a twist in it, isn't there?
Yeah.
Just just try and forget that and hopefully we'll still be able to enjoy it.
I bet he's a woman, that bloke.
No, you think it's the future, but it's actually set in the past.
It's not Earth.
- It's all a dream.
- Oh, could you not Could you not try and guess what the twist is?
It's just that might get a little annoying.
But isn't that half the fun, trying to guess the twist?
Personally, I think it It kind of, it ruins the fun.
Well, I think it makes it more fun.
- It's just I don't.
- Well, I do, and I'm the boss.
I'm your boss.
They're all clones.
He's his own brother.
Everyone's a ghost.
Have you still not seen the film yet?
What's that?
What?
It's cold and I'm going out for a cigarette.
Morning.
You must be Jen's mother.
What a night I had last night.
- Yes, the cookery, how was it?
- I am so embarrassed, - I cannot tell you.
- What happened?
It wasn't a cookery class at all.
- What was it?
- He wrote it down wrong, - cause his English isn't very good.
- Always the way.
And it turns out he didn't want to teach me how to cook He wanted to cook me!
What?
He wanted to eat me!
I know egg and my face were in alignment.
- He wanted to eat you?
- Yes.
He's one of those German cannibals.
He is and he was such a nice man.
- Was he?
- Yeah.
He was a fine Young Cannibal.
Hang on He wanted to eat you?
Yeah, keep up Jen.
So we had a laugh about it and in the end, I didn't really feel like being eaten, so we just watched Ocean's Eleven.
Original or remake?
Is that really the most important question?
I hang on, - You watched a film with him?
- Yes.
- With the man that wanted to eat you?
- Who else?
- Why didn't you call the police?
- Why would I call the police?
He wanted to eat you!
Only with my consent and, believe me, my consent was not forthcoming.
- Good for you, Moss.
- But eating people is illegal!
- Only without their consent.
- No, Moss, no.
- It's a grey area, give me that.
- I knew something was askew.
Who ever heard of German food?
You should see his place, it's incredible.
He's got a great system, 50" TV.
Really?
Maybe we could watch the film at his place!
I don't know, he's only really interested in people he can eventually eat.
- Tell him he can eat me!
- Are you insane?
You've got to call the police.
Jen, don't be such an old fuddy-duddy.
The world has changed.
If two grown men can't make a pervert happy for a few minutes in order to watch a film about zombies, then maybe we should all just move to Iran.
I don't know, Roy.
It does seem a little immoral to mislead him.
But then, as Jen pointed out earlier, being a cannibal's a little immoral too.
I'm in an ethical pickle.
Turns out meeting new people is a lot more complicated than I'd originally thought.
- Yen!
- Yorg.
What are you doing?
You cannot smoke here.
They are moving us to a new smoking area.
- So the rumours were true - Quickly, before they see you.
What are you doing?
It's over, Yorg.
We must fight them, Yen.
We must all fight them.
We must keep smoking until the bitter end!
Yorg.
Yorg, such fire.
I am too tired for revolution.
And we've walked f miles.
Goodbye, Yorg.
Taxi!
- Let's not fight again.
- No.
And look, we're out, we're meeting people.
Yes.
- You were a bit wonky.
- Thanks, dear.
Hello!
Hello!
How wonderful!
Johann, this is Roy.
Roy, this is Johann.
Hello Johann.
I brought dessert!
Come in.
Come in.
Ja.
- This is lovely!
- Yes!
Yes.
Lovely.
Isn't this nice!
So we'll watch the film, then I'll tell him I changed my mind.
Lovely and Now, that's a guitar.
So, Roy, has Moss explained to you - my desires?
- He has indeed.
- And are you interested?
- I'm very interested.
Splendid!
Moss, if you will excuse us?
- Do you eat in here?
- Yes, this way, please.
But didn't you want to watch the film that I have here?
I'd completely forgotten.
There was that film that I wanted to watch before Johann ate me.
- That's right.
- There it is there now.
- Yes.
- So you want to watch a film?
- Yes, thanks.
- Is that OK?
- Yes, of course.
- I'll put it on.
Is it very long?
Two hours, 20.
No, I'll wait.
- You wouldn't steal a handbag - These piracy warnings Tell me about it.
What now?
You wouldn't shoot a policeman, then steal his helmet Hello, there.
Yes, can I help you?
Police!
Don't move!
If my mother thinks I'm a cannibal, I'll be for the high jump.
For once, can we please not bring your mother into it.
Here we go again!
Well, boys, we're in a bit of a sticky situation, aren't we?
Where d'you get this film?
This is an illegal copy of a film.
Are you not worried that we might be cannibals?
Cannibals?
The man who was with us is a cannibal.
- He was going to eat me.
- Well, it's not really my area.
I do copyright violation, that sort of thing, but I'll let someone know.
Anyway!
Where d'you get this?
Interesting film.
Who'd have thought at the end that bloke turned out to be the
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
And then Peter said, "Brie, "that's my favourite cheese as well".
And that was when my bag I don't know what happened, it just kind of split open.
Apples and oranges everywhere.
And we tumbled about.
Yeah.
Like a pair of confused little kittens.
And when Peter had helped me pick everything up, well it just seemed rude not to give him my number.
Hey, you asked for my number!
I'm not a slut.
Oh, is that the end of the story?
OK, are we all set for tonight?
Yes.
Can you please bring me some wine?
That was some Buying the same sort of cheese!
You made a 20-minute story out of it.
Have you thought of adapting it into a film?
No.
Well done, you've bagged a normal.
Yes.
He is proper normal, isn't he?
He's taking me to Paris this weekend.
Ah, Paris - Have you been to Paris, Moss?
- No.
No.
I've heard of it.
- Brie?
- Yeah, what?
Nothing.
I had you down a Double-Gloucester-type person.
Yes, I know what you mean.
It's been ages since I had a mini-break.
Not only that but all of my friends are single and so are all of his, so tonight, we're gonna have a big dinner party and It's gonna be brilliant.
Or perhaps that should be "brie-lliant".
Do you know, it is really important to me that you like him.
No, honestly, it is I know we had some rocky beginnings but I really think of you now not just as my workmates, but as friends.
- Stop it!
- No, I I mean that.
I really do.
You're really important to me.
Listen, Jen, I've got some bad news, Colin can't make it tonight.
Oh.
But Steve and Jake are still coming?
Colin was bringing them.
I don't know them well, it'd be uncomfortable without Colin.
I suppose we'll have to call the whole thing off.
Unless you can find three guys to replace them.
I Bit of dust.
I'm gonna definitely later phone the Strange Oh, look at that Oh, I can't I can't It's my home, it's my special place, I can't let you nut-jobs into my special place!
"Nut-jobs"?
I hope you're not including me in that.
Wait a second, we were all "brilliant friends" a minute ago.
Yes, yes, I meant friends in a different way, in a kind of special way that means you can't come into my home.
Right, so sort of like not being your friends at all.
Yes, yes, sort of like that but in a really special way.
This is your lowest moment, you know.
I think I can live with it.
Roy, can you look at my PC, please?
It keeps freezing.
Did you hear something, Moss?
I thought I heard a noise.
I didn't hear anything, Roy.
Unless it was some kind of stupid mouse.
Yeah, or Or a rat.
Yes, I think it did sound more like a rat.
I know I was horrible.
I'm sorry.
Richmond Oh, Richmond, not you too.
I'm sorry, Richmond Hello!
I smell food!
What are you doing?
Don't sit down yet.
Why not?
I'm tired.
That's the rules.
We stand around a bit first.
- We have drinks.
- Where's Peter?
In the kitchen.
- Can I go to the toilet?
- Yes, you may.
You don't need to ask.
It's just down there to the left.
There you go.
Thank you, Roy.
How lovely.
White wine.
Never seen a wine actually called "White Wine".
Thank you, Roy.
What are you drinking?
Red wine, please.
- Richmond?
- Do you have absinthe?
- No.
- I only drink absinthe.
Absinthe, no.
Red wine, white wine, Carlsberg?
Carlsberg, perfect.
That was quick.
I washed my hands!
- What do you want to drink?
- White Russian.
A white Russian?
Oh, for God's sake!
Documentaries Balsamic vinegar Conversation I heard one of Jen's friends is a model.
I bagsy the model!
We discussed it as a group, and we think it would be best if I were to sit beside the model Because I would like to ask her how I would go about becoming a photographer.
Or a model.
Paula?
She'll appreciate that.
She's just had reconstructive face surgery so she'll be happy to have someone to talk to.
Right.
It's really brave of her to come out because she was in a really bad car accident so you have to be extra nice to her.
Car accident.
Brilliant.
Just my luck.
I'll be honest.
The reason I got you round a bit early is to go over some ground rules, OK?
If this evening is gonna work in any way, you need to pretend to be normal people, yeah?
Keep the conversation about things that would interest everybody.
You know, nothing about memory or RAM.
Memory is RAM!
Oh, dear!
If you stray into areas I don't think appropriate, I'll I don't know I'll cough.
Coughing is the signal.
Richmond, did you hear that?
What?
If Jen coughs we have to stop talking.
Fine.
Moss, this is important, I'm sitting you beside Margaret.
Margaret, from her name I presume she's a lay-dee?
Yes.
She's nice.
She got divorced recently but I should say when she's had a few drinks she tends to get a bit over excited.
Needs to go to the toilet a lot.
That happens to me.
I try to think of something dry, like the desert or Shredded wheat.
You don't understand.
What I'm saying is she's kind of She's kind of on the look out for a man.
I see.
What does he look like?
He wouldn't come here, not with all these people around.
What's this about?
- Jen's friend has got a stalker.
- Cool.
God, maybe I could just kill myself.
Here they are, so look normal.
Look more normal, more normal!
Relax!
Forget it!
Hello.
Come in.
Hello.
I'm Roy.
I'm sorry about the accident.
Hello.
This is Paula.
Yep, I know.
I was talking to her.
Did you think I was talking to you?
This is Jessica.
Hello, everybody!
Oh, my God.
Social situations!
Oh, bloody hell, I think this is my one.
These are my workmates.
They're not my usual friends.
I work with them, they're my workmates.
Oh, yes.
"IT department does not compute".
Oh, my God!
- You must be Roy.
- Yep.
Hello, everybody!
I have had a few drinks already, so, no-one take advantage of me.
Oh, go on then!
I was very pleased with my last campaign.
I just started running it today.
That's you!
So how bad was the accident?
Well, a motorbike jumped the lights and so I swerved into a lamppost.
The airbag didn't deploy so I hit the dashboard.
- With your facial area.
- I hit it full in the face.
Of course you did!
Speed?
I was doing about 75.
That's fast!
When you regained consciousness, did you look in the mirror and think, "Oh, God, my face is ruined"?
They didn't let me see my face after the accident.
I see.
They said it might not be as symmetrical as it once had been, but symmetry isn't everything.
Yeah I like symmetry.
Stop it!
Stop it!
I'm trying to eat my dinner!
Gosh.
Oh dear!
Look at us having a conversation.
Yikes!
Getting to know you, getting to know all about you!
Eating!
Hello, how are you?
"Oh, I'm a fish.
Help, I'm being eaten"!
You know when you laugh, I can see the outline of your skull.
You have a beautiful skull.
So the surgeon - Yeah?
- Good man?
Very.
He did his own nose.
And did you meet him before the operation?
Yeah, he ran me through it.
He was really nice.
- Confident?
- Why are you so interested?
My mother is thinking of having a breast augmentation.
- I see.
- Yeah.
Always wanted them bigger!
But I promised I'd get them for her birthday.
- Her 60th is coming up.
- Right.
Well, I think a round of applause is justified for that dinner.
Yes, and thanks, Peter, for making it.
So, who's for dessert?
- Isn't this dessert?
- No, that's tartare sauce.
- Can I have some dessert?
- Yes.
I'll have the tartare sauce.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Look how ticklish he is!
- Stop it!
- Come on!
Jen, do something about that woman!
- I warned you about her.
- When?
I spent 10 min trying to warn you.
I can see why she's divorced.
She's very divorceable.
You can't wait to take her to court to get rid of her!
What are you doing?
Well, not that it's any of your business, but I was planning to have a little poo.
No, no, I mean with Paula.
You keep asking her all those questions about her accident.
- I'm interested!
- You're wondering - what state her face is in.
- Was that obvious?
I suppose I better go back in there and see what Judy Finnegan's up to!
If this keeps on going on I will divorce her.
You're not married to her.
No, I suppose I suppose I'm not.
Come on, behave yourselves.
There's still a chance to save this thing.
Oh why Sorry, I couldn't hear you.
I said, "Do you think you'd die if you drank wee"?
I don't know, but it's a bloody good question.
Here's a question - who here would eat a spider?
I would.
I ate an eel in New York but I was on stage so it doesn't count.
Ah, New York, the city of apples.
Peter, I got that link for the Firefox extension.
What's your e-mail address?
- Do you have a pen?
- I'm recording.
It's filepeter@hotmail.
com.
"Filepeter"?
And why "filepeter"?
Well, File is my second name.
Right, I see.
Peter File.
Who's a paedophile?
No, no, his name is Peter File.
His name is paedophile?
Don't say it like that!
It sounds like "paedophile".
- That what he just said.
- No.
"Peter File".
- Paedo File?
- PETER File.
- Who's a paedophile?
- No one.
Right.
It just sounds like "paedophile".
No, it doesn't.
Does a bit.
"Peter File".
"Peter File"?
It does.
Yes, I suppose it does!
I hadn't noticed so It doesn't worry you, does it?
No, no.
Of course it doesn't.
They say "PED-o-phile" in America.
Maybe you should move to America!
He's not moving to America!
Raiders Of The Lost Ark?
Circle Of Friends?
- It's so obvious!
- No speaking!
I've been standing here for 10 min.
- Where's Richmond and Jessica?
- Pirates Of The Caribbean!
Why Pirates Of The Caribbean?
I don't know but it was a great movie!
Johnny Depp, what a revelation!
It's Crash!
It's very obviously Crash!
Here's a car crashing into another car, there's people screaming and blood Oh, Paula!
Let's play Spin The Bottle!
Oh, for God's sake!
- Oh, what?
- Nothing.
- I'm embarrassing him!
- You're making a fool of yourself!
- He's a delicate flower.
- You are drunk!
If you paid more attention to me Tell me, Margaret, tell us all, how could we pay any more attention to you?
You've changed.
You're not the same man I liked when I came into the party.
We've all changed, Margaret.
We all have.
For God's sake!
Night, Jen.
Roy's gonna walk me home.
Oh, lovely.
It's just in case any kind of Elephant man mob situation kicks off.
Sorry about Margaret, it won't happen again.
Fiddly-do.
Come on, let's get you home.
- Goodbye, Jen.
- Bye, Jen.
Bye.
Oh, my God!
Nightmare!
An absolute nightmare.
What do you mean?
Well, I always have this theory that if you let your work life mix with your personal life, then somehow, something will go wrong.
But nothing has, has it?
I think it all went rather well.
They all seemed to pair off.
It's what you want from an evening like this.
I suppose so.
You're gonna have to face the fact you run a very successful dinner party, Jen Barber.
You didn't do too badly yourself, "paedophile".
- Thanks for walking me home.
- That's OK.
Goodbye.
- You live here?
- Yeah.
That's a big telly.
And all the consoles.
You've got all of the consoles.
Why having them all?
I'd hate it if a game came out on one and I couldn't play it so it's best to get them all.
Don't you think?
I do think.
And a man doesn't live here?
No, just me.
I'm gonna gamble.
What?
Would you like to come for a drink some time?
You know, like a date?
What the hell?
Roy, I'm very flattered Good.
Of course you are.
Thursday?
But you're not my type.
What?
I mean physically.
Physically?
Hello!
I think I can do better.
- Can I have a lend of this?
- No.
Listen, Jen.
When we get back, maybe we should think about, I don't know, moving your stuff over to my place, vice versa, I don't mind but I think it's time we moved onto the next level, - don't you?
- Yes.
Yes, definitely.
Great.
If there is a Peter File in the terminal building could he please make his way to gate 24?
We are looking for a Peter File.
24 we're at the wrong gate!
Could Peter File please make himself known to ground staff?
I'm Peter File!
We are looking for a Peter File.
I'm Peter File!
Wait here!
I'm Peter File!
Hold on!
Come on, Jen.
I'm Peter File!
It's "Peter File" not "paedophile".
It's very loud, mind if I turn it down?
I wouldn't do that!
Oh, dear!
Look at me, having an orgasm!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1 Morning, beautiful.
Course, I'll send someone up as soon as I can, OK?
Bye.
You're very late, it's been crazy down here.
We've had a call.
Sorry.
Oh, God!
Oh.
Are you all right?
Are you poorly?
No, it's just, it's just a bad bra.
It's the only one I had handy this morning and it's really terrible, it's pinching into my sides and the straps are digging into my shoulders.
All that and it's not even giving my breasts proper support!
It's killing me.
Oh, Moss.
- Oh, I'm sorry, are you OK?
- What happened?
Sometimes I forget I'm not just working with other women.
No, it's my fault, I really ought to be able to listen to a woman talking about bras without Hello, good morning, here I am.
Here we go.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, the first time I wasn't expecting you to start talking about bras and then, the second time, it just came as a bit of surprise to hear myself talking about them.
It's been a rollercoaster.
Why don't you just have a lie down in there?
Morning.
Morning.
God, I feel rough.
Good stag?
Yeah, you know, standard stag.
I may have got a little bit drunk towards the end there.
Oh, well what kind of celebration would it be if you didn't pass out at some point?
Yeah, thank God nobody noticed.
How do you know I passed out?
I'm a bit psychic sometimes, and I bet you came straight from the party as well, didn't you?
Oh, that's easy, I'm wearing the same clothes.
Roy, I was trying to remember how that song goes, The Locomotion, do you remember that song?
- Yeah, course I remember.
- How's it go again?
You know it, you must know it.
No, no, no.
It's - It is a funny song.
- You all right there?
- Yep, it's just a bad bra.
Right, I have got to go, heads of department meeting.
After last week's fiasco, I need to make a good impression.
We didn't think you'd believe us.
If you'd just stopped to think about it for one second you'd have realised that it wasn't true.
I don't think that's true.
With all due respect, John, I am Head of IT.
And I have it on good authority.
If you type Google into Google, you can break the Internet, so please no-one try it, even for a joke.
It's not a laughing matter, you can break the Internet.
You don't know what those meetings are like, they are murder.
It does you no harm to look a little foolish from time to time.
Roy, there's something I should let you know.
What?
Stephanie called earlier.
Douglas needs someone to take a look at his computer.
No, no, no, no, no, get Moss to do it.
Oh, Moss isn't feeling too well and besides, of the two of you, you're the expert.
The Ordinary Boys, where do they get these crazy names?
Entrare.
I'm Roy, IT.
My computer's, my computer's broken I have to say that's a really wild look.
You know, things are moving just so fast, I can't keep up.
First, The Ordinary Boys, and now this.
Should I check it out?
Great, yeah.
Let's get started, shall we?
What?
What needs my expertise?
You did say you were with IT, didn't you?
Yeah.
Come on, Mr Renow, while I'm down here.
I may as well get to work.
OK, I'm gonna move over here.
Sure.
I can see where you've been having problems.
See, this isn't actually a computer.
It's a brief case.
- Excellent.
- I'll have one sent up.
I admire you, Roy.
You've got the guts to stand up in what you believe in.
OK, see you then.
Good luck.
Which means that we now have the cleanest toilets of any legal department in London.
Thank you.
Well done, James, you managed to speak for eight minutes without actually saying anything.
I think that what.
What?
No, nothing.
Who's next?
Right, Jen, OK, what's going on down in middle earth?
Thank you, John, and, prepare to be astonished because I have discovered four ways to increase our online visibility without spending a single penny.
Number one Excuse me, sorry Number one Number one You bloody thing.
For God's sake!
Bloody thing, bloody pain in the arse.
I'm a woman.
It's really pinching my sides, the straps are digging into my shoulders.
Eh, Moss, look, I'm a woman.
And I love you, Moss, I love you.
The straps are digging into my shoulders.
They're not giving my breasts proper support, proper support, proper support.
Hang on a second.
Hang on a second.
I've done it.
I've done it.
- Hello.
- Hello, Jen.
Who is this?
That's not important right now.
Well, it says Moss on my phone.
Yes, all right, it's me.
Why are you disguising your voice?
Because if someone is listening in on this conversation, I don't want them to know my identity.
But they know now.
Yes, thanks.
So why don't you use your normal voice, now?
It's attached to the phone, I'd have to hang up Look, just listen to me.
Why don't you just come in and speak to me?
You're ruining You're ruining everything.
What do you want, Moss?
Take your top off, Jen.
Sorry?
You heard me, take your top off.
- What's this all about anyway?
- You'll see.
Is this another one of your inventions?
Maybe.
What was the last one?
Oh, yeah.
A ladder to help moths escape from the bath.
How's that useful?
How's that not useful?
Moths don't get stuck in baths.
Yes, they do.
Even if that were true, it's just not in their nature to learn how to use a ladder.
They have wings.
When a moth thinks about travelling vertically upwards, a ladder is just the last thing they would think of.
Moss, I don't like to be negative about it, but everything you invent is worthless.
Ah, well, prepare to put mustard on those words, for you will soon be consuming them, along with this slice of humble pie that comes direct from the oven of shame set at gas mark egg-on-your-face.
I sort of forget what I was talking about.
Ah, here's Jen.
Oh, that's it, it's a bra.
I've made a brilliant bra.
How are ye?
Is it, er, comfortable?
This is possibly the most comfortable bra I have ever worn.
Donning clothes over a bad bra is like building a house without laying a foundation.
It's just a false economy and an ill-fitting bra could well ruin your otherwise painstakingly-selected ensemble.
You really know your stuff.
- Thank you.
- Google?
Jen, Roy, bad bras are more than just a nuisance, they're a menace.
Years of wearing a bad bra can contribute to upper back and shoulder pain.
It can even lead to headaches.
So what makes this bra different?
It can never go bad.
What do you mean?
Tiny elements of fissilca rub together to prevent the fabric from resting too long in any one position.
It's a living bra.
The effect would be rather like having a large pair of man's hands holding the breasts in position.
But the bra will go bad, all bras go bad.
Not this one, Jen.
But don't take my word for it, take it out for a spin.
So what's it called?
I call it the Abracada-bra!
You are kidding me.
- No.
- You're really going on Dragons' Den?
I've got an interview today with the producers at the BBC.
Oh, that is just huge.
You're gonna be on telly.
But you've got to keep this under your respective hats so if anyone asks for me, my name is Stephen Jennal.
Why Stephen Jennal?
If my calculations are correct, this could be the only bra a woman need ever buy.
Do you know what Playtexwould do to me if they knew about the Abracada-bra?
- What would they do?
- They would kill me.
I don't know if they'd kill you, Moss.
Playtex have changed a lot over the last few years.
Nonetheless, I want complete secrecy on this one, so if anyone asks for me, my name is Stephen Fennal.
I chose Stephen Fennal because it's easy to remember.
Right.
Except, well, you did say Stephen Jennal earlier.
Smoke and mirrors, Roy.
Is it Fennel?
Is it Jennal?
If I don't know, how will they?
Who am I, Roy?
I'm a ghost.
I'm a shadow.
I'm gone.
Hello, Moss speaking.
Well done, good presentation.
- Thanks, James.
- Jen, a word.
Got Helen Bewley coming in tomorrow.
Do you know who she is?
Of course I do.
She's just been made head of BHDR Industries, so obviously we need to make friends.
I know, BHDR Industries, they're the top makers of that product that has something to do with our company.
Exactly.
I want you up front at that meeting.
We can't have Helen going back to BHDR saying Renham Industries is just a boys' club.
- How does that sound?
- Sounds great.
All right, see you tomorrow.
Stephen Premmal?
Oh, hello.
Yeah, I'm Stephen Premmal.
I think.
You're very late.
Quick.
Hello, Stephen Premmel.
I'm afraid I'm very late.
What exactly, um, is?
Gavin Briers here with developments in North Korea.
It's five years since the war in Iraq began.
The conflict rages on with no hope of a solution in sight.
I'm joined by Stephen Premmel, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence.
Mr Premmel?
Hello.
Iraq is a gigantic and bloody mess, isn't it?
Yes.
Well, how do you explain it?
Well, we shouldn't have gone to war.
You think the original invasion was a mistake?
Oh, yes.
I'm astonished you should agree to this so readily when your department must take a lot of the blame.
What?
We didn't do anything.
You raised no objection in the run up to the war.
Yes, I did.
I signed a petition.
Sorry?
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
When can I start talking about my bra?
Jen, can you bring me the prototype when you're ready?
There are a couple of glitches I need to iron out.
Sure.
Guess who I'm about to meet now.
Helen Bewley.
Oh, come on.
She took that football team to court for institutional sexism, won massive damages, and now she's Head CEO at BHDR Industries.
It's all right.
I kinda switched off after the word football.
Did you see it?
Is he in?
Is he?
There I am, catching up with the news events of the day, when who should appear upon my television screen?
It's only the Ministry of Defence.
The news, Dragons' Den, you're all over the schedules.
I'm sorry, Moss, are you really sure you're ready to go on Dragons' Den?
Yes, it's a brilliant product.
Don't get me wrong.
You have got the science down but it's all the other stuff, isn't it?
- What other stuff?
- OK, well OK, well, let's say this staple is science, you're good at this.
What you're not so good at is everything else in the world.
That's where I come in.
I can help you with all this other stuff, you know, give you some tips on business and presentation, leaving you free to concentrate on this.
- What's in it for you?
- A cut.
All right, you're in for half a percent.
25%.
Half a percent.
Deal.
OK, first thing we need to do is buy the rights for the word Abracada-bra.
Agreed, but before that, we've got to sort out the overheating problem.
Overheating problem?
Yes, it's got a very, very, serious overheating problem.
I'll have it sorted by next week.
Just need to get it back off Jen.
Which has lead to significant gains in this area and an overall yield of 22%.
Thank you very much.
Jen, is it?
Yes, Miss Bewley.
Please, Helen.
As the only 2 women in the room, we can dispense with formalities, don't you?
Renham Industries has come a long way in the past few years if a young woman like this can blossom within its walls.
I remember when the atmosphere here here was a lot less conducive to what I can remember one executive calling "working skirt".
Yes.
Well, I think we're all a little older and a little wiser now, Helen.
One would hope so.
Are you OK, Jen?
My tits.
Oh, my tits are hot.
They're really, really hot.
Oh, my tits are on fire.
Yep, my tits are on fire.
They are on fire.
My tits are on fire!
Oh, yeah!
All right!
- 40%.
- 20%.
- 40.
- 40?
!
You owe me.
Helen Bewley has gone away thinking I was a stripper hired as a prank.
But 40%, Jen, be reasonable.
I have two black rings around here.
I could sue you and get everything.
- All right, all right.
- Good, thank you.
Now, I can concentrate on your presentation.
- I'm doing presentation.
- Where did you get pizza?
Some idiot left it in the toilet.
I am doing presentation.
No, hold on.
Moss is my best friend, and I'm damned if I'm - Do something else.
- Like what?
I don't know.
Fitness.
Fitness?
!
People do need to be fit to go on Dragons' Den.
Come on, Moss, you're keeping the dragons waiting.
Hey, Jen, Roy.
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.
And you sorted out the overheating problem?
I'm completely sure that I've absolutely sorted out the overheating problem, yes.
Unless I've made it even worse.
How do you feel?
Do you feel ready?
My middle name is ready.
No, that doesn't sound right.
I eat ready for breakfast.
OK, maybe don't talk too much.
Let the product do the talking.
What do I do when they want me to do the talking?
- You're scaring him.
- Don't be scared, Moss.
This is one of the biggest moments of your life.
You cannot get nervous now because if you do, Moss, it'll be a disaster, a disaster!
Shut up!
I don't want to do it.
I feel trapped, like a moth in a bath.
Moss, we're already late.
Will you come on with me?
- What?
- Please.
Oh, actually, maybe it's just the thing.
If Helen Bewley sees it, she'll realise I'm a proper professional, and not a member of the sex industry.
You sure?
I'm positive.
You can do presentation.
And I'll do fitness.
"Jen, Roy and Morris are I professionals with Renham Industries.
"They walk up the stairs and across the room.
"They nod at the dragons.
"One of them, Morris, puts a case on a chair.
"The dragons are beside piles of money, with pens".
Women in the workplace Take your time.
Women working in a workplace environment work in workplaces where they work and as a woman, and as a woman, as a worker, as a woman worker who works in the workplace Sorry, bit of asthma.
We are looking for Â£400,000 for 2%.
We'd welcome your questions.
Wow, this music sounds like it comes from space.
- Yeah, mate.
- It does.
Ordinary boys they ain't.
I'm having a good time.
Yeah.
This is good, good shit.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
You there!
Blind, wizened man.
I have come from a faraway place to seek a great sorcerer.
I am whom you seek.
You?
You're nothing but an old man in rags playing hoopaloo with the wind.
You wish for proof.
Aye.
Pick a card.
Don't tell me.
Put it back in the pack.
Is this your card?
No, but damn close.
You are the man I seek.
Come, sit.
Tell me a tale.
It is a woman.
It is always a woman.
Her sweet voice wakes a mighty tiger behind my fly.
Yet she is proud and will not have me.
Her name is Jane or Jan or something similar.
You would have her to your bed, would you?
Aye.
A thousand times, aye.
Take this tinc tincture, and put it in her drink.
She'll be yours within moments.
Thank you.
I will use it well.
What's that for?
Sorry, it was an accident.
What did you do that for?
!
Like I say, it was an accident.
- It was full of coins!
- All right!
I've apologised once.
That was a stupid thing to do!
You could have caught it, you idiot.
- That was a stupid thing to do!
- I have no time for this bullshit.
Transcripts: subtitle.me.
uk - What level is this?
- Shut up!
- Oh, my God!
- Woo!
- That was perfect!
- I rock!
Didn't miss a note.
I am wasting my life.
I am wasting my life.
What, am I gonna put this on my CV?
- Can't something just be fun?
- Oh, no, put it away, please.
But I've got a big gig coming up.
Put it away.
- All right, Yoko.
- Oh, God.
Are you still in the same clothes as yesterday?
I, er, may have met a lady in the pub last night.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yes, it was quite a memorable evening.
Good for you.
Oh, Stephanie, hi.
Oh, God.
Right, OK, yeah.
I'll send him right I'll be right up.
Bye.
Douglas again?
Yeah.
He keeps bringing me up on these flimsy pretexts.
The other day, it was to show me a dead fly.
Fly!
Yeah, it's getting a little ridiculous.
Wait until I tell you what happened last night.
Wait till I tell you what's just happened to me.
I bought this muffin from the canteen, and I'll be Jolly Rogered if there's not hyperoside in it.
Curium.
Ebrium.
And unless I'm going crazy, that's selenium.
It's definitely hyperoside, and it's not listed in the table of contents.
That was a great story.
You remember the woman from last night?
She seemed lovely, right?
She was a delight.
Yeah.
We get outside, there was a group of tramps, two of whom she knows by name.
She starts screaming at them, "You owe me money"!
She thinks that the tramps owe her money.
Next thing I know, it all kicks off.
I'm running for my life.
It was a horrible evening, Moss, a horrible evening, and she's a horrible woman.
Right But you slept with her?
I've been expecting you.
You asked me to come up.
Which is why I've been expecting you.
Anyway, I'm glad we've got that cleared up.
I've got a lot of important papers to look over, so if you don't mind What, leave?
Yes, please.
I like you, Jen.
You don't ask questions.
A lot of people would be confused as to why I invited them up, then asked them to leave.
Not you.
A person needs a lot of backbone to be ordered around like that.
You've got spunk and balls.
And I like that in a woman.
Thank you.
Which is why I'd like you to be my P.A. - Really?
- Yes.
Stephanie's leaving.
Definitely?
No, Stephanie.
Come sit on my big hand.
It's a huge pay rise, a chance of wonderful opportunities.
you'd be crazy to pass up.
Sex.
- What?
- What?
Did you just say sex?
I don't think so.
Come on, Jen!
I need your mind on the job, not thinking about sexy sex all the time.
It's true, I have been accused of sexy shenanigans against my female employees.
Yes, there's that court case.
Yeah, but she'll settle.
That was the old me.
This is the new me.
And I want you to be a part of it.
A part of me.
Sex Moss, I've got something to tell you.
Oh, my God!
- Wait 'till I tell you.
- Ah, sorry.
Where's Roy?
He should be here.
Before you begin, I should say that I have problems processing big news.
Douglas has asked me to be his P.A. Oh, my God!
His P.A. Oh my God!
That is something and a half.
His P.A. How?
His Shut up!
His P.A!
It means personal assistant.
Thank you.
Right.
OK.
What does that actually involve?
Oh, picking up his mail, going to the supermarket for him, getting his washing.
I have to say, Moss, it's a real step up.
How are you going to do that and work here?
That's the thing.
He wants me to quit the department.
You're not going to do it, are you?
Well, there's a huge pay rise.
Phew.
So, no?
No, I probably am.
But what about the pay rise?
- That's if I go.
- Right.
He's not paying me more to stay here.
Of course not, that'd be ridiculous.
So, am I getting a pay rise?
Why would you get a pay rise?
OK, let's just start again.
Douglas wants me to be your P.A?
No!
- Then why am I getting a pay rise?
- Whoa, why is he getting a pay rise?
Jen wants me to be her PA.
Where did you get this?
It's Douglas who wants a P.A. I don't want to be Douglas's P.A. He's not really qualified, Jen.
Do you even have the authority to offer me a pay rise?
I don't want you to be my P.A. It's Douglas who wants me to be his P.A. That's it.
That's all there is.
You don't come into it, you're not involved.
Who's Douglas?
So, Douglas wants you to be his P.A?
- Yes.
- Are you gonna do it?
I dunno, it's an opportunity, you know?
Yeah.
You should probably do it.
I mean, you don't want to be stuck down here for the rest of your life playing Guitar Hero.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Yeah, I think I'll say yes.
I think I have to.
You guys will probably be glad to see the back of me.
Wow, you're gonna let that hang there.
No, I'm joking.
Of course we won't.
Oh, for f OK.
OK, could you stop shouting at me?
OK, stop shouting at me.
I told you not to call me at work.
How are you drunk again?
It's not even noon.
Who is this?
Yeah, yeah.
This is his wife.
Please don't call here again.
Yep.
What are you gonna do without me?
You know that list of things we're not allowed to do when Jen's here?
I think it's time for a print-out.
Oh, my word.
Oh, God.
Oh, bloody hell!
This is amazing!
Get in!
Welcome to the 30th floor, Jen.
Come with me.
I wanna show you something.
Two of them now!
Yes.
Do you want me to get rid of them?
Ten minutes in and you've already paid for yourself.
So, Terry can do squash on the Tuesday.
Lucinda says she can't wait.
And Chessington World of Adventures say they're very sorry, but you're not allowed back.
Whatever.
How long have you been working for me now, Jen?
Three, four months, is it?
Well, no, it's just been today.
You're right.
We went jogging, I knackered that squirrel, the hand thing happened.
Feels longer.
Feels like we've built up a, er, connection.
Yes, yes, a business connection.
Yeah, yeah.
More than that, though.
No, I don't think so.
Well, I feel like.
Know what I mean?
I do and I disagree.
Anyway, these came back today.
Come on, Jen!
Ever feel like just having some fun?
Mr Reynholm, I am a professional.
I take my job seriously.
And if I wasn't able to do it properly, I'd be letting myself and you down.
So, please, either let me do my job or let me go.
Anyway, these came back today and they said they've done their very best but some of the stains just won't come out.
Good God.
You looked exactly like Melissa there.
Melissa?
My wife.
She died.
Oh, poor you.
That's terrible.
There's not a day goes past that I don't think of her.
I'll never forget our final moments.
Help me!
My husband's trying to kill me!
Oh, oh, I'm so, so sorry.
- Would you do me a favour?
- What?
I want to feel like Melissa is alive just one last time.
Here's a selection of her lingerie.
Oh, Mr Reynholm!
Please dress as my sexy dead wife!
Oh, this isn't working out.
I thought, given time, you'd get past the sex thing, but you obviously can't.
I'm going back to IT, where my skills are appreciated.
I'm not interested in you sexually and I never will be.
I didn't want it to come to this, Jen.
But would you like a cup of tea?
Very busy.
Leave a message.
Before you do this, you're sure you can hit it so that it won't damage my teeth as it goes in?
It's a very simple chip shot.
You totalled that cup, dude!
OK, one more try.
Jen would never let us do this!
No, she'd be like, "This is dangerous, you're gonna hit Moss in the face".
How many more things have we got left on the list?
I think we've done nearly all of them.
Yeah.
OK, we've had a little sleep, we've walked around in our pants The only thing left to do is a prank phone-call.
All right, but let's concentrate on this first.
WINDOW SMASHES Whoops!
OK, do it again.
Two lovely cups of tea.
I'm like your P.A, cos I made the tea!
Hang on.
We both take it the same way, don't we?
Aren't you gonna drink it?
I will in a bit.
So, well done on passing the test, Jen.
- The test?
- Yes!
The clumsy seduction.
Don't say you couldn't see through it.
They were a test to find out whether you really wanted to work for me or whether you just wanted to come up here for my body.
Oh, no, no, no.
Not at all.
- All right.
- No, no.
Physically, you're just not the sort of man I go for.
Yeah, thanks.
I go for classically good-looking men.
Blond, broad, clean-shaven.
All right!
Enough of the jibber jabber!
I want you to watch this DVD presentation I've just made.
Any thoughts?
I haven't seen it yet.
Then see it now!
Hello, I'd like to order a pizza, please.
Can I have it with extra grapes?
Grapes?
!
What are you like?
Yes, a pizza with grapes, please.
What?
You have a pizza with grapes?
Do grapes even go with pizza?
Oh, I see.
Oh, you got me.
Oh, very funny.
Very mature.
You're only wasting your own time.
I wish I could've seen the look on his face!
I can't believe we've done the whole list.
We've really done all eight items?
Do you want to play Guitar Hero?
I hate those kind of games.
Right - Oh, I've got one!
- What?
!
Why don't we ring them up again and ask if they do a pizza with pineapple on it?
!
Maybe somebody's computer will break.
I think you'd enjoy this more while drinking your tea.
Reynholm Industries.
A big, hard business in a big, hard building.
Busting into the future strongly, again and again.
Pounding the future.
Making the future beg for it.
The future wants it and Reynholm Industries wants to give it to the future.
That's what it's all about.
We don't want to be like a dead fly, regretting what we didn't do in our short time on this earth.
So maybe it's time to make a decision.
- What was that?
!
- What?
What happened?
Something just flashed up there.
- Really?
Are you sure?
- Let me rewind.
There it is again!
Something's wrong with your laptop.
I'll call the boys.
Roy, hello.
I didn't even hear the phone ring.
Oh, Jen!
Jen!
Hello!
It's Jen!
Hi.
How are you, Jen?
Good, yeah.
Listen, Douglas's computer - What's been happening?
- What?
.
- How's everything upstairs?
- Tell her I'm here!
Moss is with me.
You do know I spoke to you four hours ago?
Jen, Jen, when are you coming back down?
- Let me speak to her!
- No!
I'm talking to her!
I don't know.
Listen, Douglas's laptop is having some difficulties.
So, can you come up and have a look?
Oh, no, not these idiots.
Mr Reynholm, the men in the IT department are my friends.
They're not idiots.
What the hell is this?
Where the hell are your trousers?
I get it.
When the cat's away.
Yeah.
It's like all the fun I had just after my wife died.
Listen, don't sit on anything.
And Mr Reynholm's laptop is broken.
Something flashed up a second ago.
I'll help!
No!
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
No, we haven't tried that.
- Well, let's have a little look see.
- I want a go!
- I want to do a job!
- You can do the next one!
Don't touch that.
Why are you drinking Rohypnol, Jen?
Flunitrazepam Yep, that's definitely Rohypnol.
Are you having problems with insomnia?
That's nonsense.
Drink it, then.
All right, I will.
There we go.
Perfectly normal cup of tea.
Now if you don't mind, I have some filoffing to do.
Filoffing?
Yes, I have some filoffels that need pipping and I'm the mulder.
You did put something in that tea!
Damn that sorcerer!
20 gold pieces and I'm wankered on Rohypnol!
Oh, God, Rohypnol!
And what's the matter with you?
I just saw his film.
I didn't care for it.
I am very aroused.
I want to come back downstairs with you guys.
No, it's all right, we've got a replacement.
- Shut up!
- Oh, right, OK.
Who's that?
.
It's an answering machine.
An answering machine?
It's called Jen 2.
It does everything you do and it doesn't boss us about.
It is brilliant.
Oh, shut up, for God's sake!
You replaced me with an answering machine?
OK, I think we should probably leave now.
I don't really like the look in his eyes.
Yeah, let's go, let's go.
Where's Jen?
Pucker up, boys.
It's hammer time!
You lot deserve each other!
I think you've accidentally locked the door there, Jen!
