{START OF EPISODE 1}
Okay, here's the situation.
Your parents went away on a week's vacation.
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche.
Would they mind?
Well, of course not.
I'll just take it for a little spin And maybe show it off to a couple of friends I'll just cruise around the neighborhood Well, maybe I shouldn't Yeah!
Of course I should Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot Pulled up to the corner at the end of my block That's when I saw this beautiful girly-girl walking I picked up my car phone To perpetrate like I was talking Sunroof was open, the music was high And that girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car I can't believe it!
I made a mistake But parents are the same No matter time nor place So to all you kids all across the land No need to argue Parents just don't understand Yeah!
All right!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just a little something I know.
So, what's up?
Someone is on fire in Ramsett Park.
They need you to get down there right away.
Oh, my God.
I've been spending the summer doing a lot of zoo promotions.
For he's a jolly good fellow Parrots live a very long time.
So we had a birthday party for a parrot that turned 60.
which nobody can deny Chimpanzees are very smart, so we had them graduate from college.
And they like to fling their feces, so we were hoping that they would fling their hats.
But they just flung their feces.
The Pawnee Zoo recently purchased two South African black-footed penguins, Tux and Flipper.
And as part of our zoo promotion, we are going to give them a marriage ceremony, because they mate for life.
Tux, do you take Flipper, to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do!
I do!
By the power vested in me from the Department of Parks and Recreation, I now pronounce you husband and wife!
Oh!
Okay, well, at least they're married.
Are they making babies?
Well, not those two.
Those are both boy penguins.
I'm sorry?
Tux and Flipper are both boys.
So you should have pronounced them husband and husband, technically.
That's awesome.
Still, you couldn't have asked for better weather.
Brendanawicz, you big sandwich eater.
Oh Cut it out, now.
Just to be clear, that was a friend punch.
There was no flirtatious meaning behind that playful punch I just gave your arm.
Yes, I do understand.
You've made it abundantly clear that there's no romantic element to our relationship in any way.
Yes.
Good.
Isn't it good to be able to just kind of horse around like this as friends?
It is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I really hit rock bottom that night.
And I mean that I literally fell to the bottom of a pit and hit a rock.
I remember laying there thinking, "There's probably a good reason why I'm down here and single".
And then I started thinking, "I need morphine".
Oh, yeah, I hear you made two male penguins very happy today.
You're making history, Knope.
I like that.
Sticking your neck out, you know.
No, I didn't stick my neck out.
It was an accident.
Out of the mainstream.
I think that's cool.
I'm in the mainstream.
Yeah, I know.
No, no.
Not out of it.
Social activism.
No!
Uh-uh.
People in this town don't really like their government employees being activists.
Last year, a garbage man was suspended for wearing a Live Strong bracelet.
Hey, Leslie, some guy who owns a gay bar sent you a cake.
Pawnee has a gay bar?
Yeah.
The Bulge.
It's behind my house.
The Bulge is a gay bar?
Uh, the nights I've wasted there.
"Leslie!
Hey, girrrrrrrrl"!
With eight R's.
"Thank you for supporting the cause of gay marriage.
"You rock!
The boys at The Bulge".
They thought that was a political gesture?
Okay, nobody eat that cake.
Tom?
Step into my office.
That's also my office.
Yeah, whatever.
I know that you are not gay.
No, I'm not.
But you're effeminate.
What?
Well, you're wearing a peach shirt with a coiled snake on it.
Yes, 'cause it was featured in Details magazine.
And it's awesome.
Effeminate.
Anyway, so the point is, do you think that marrying penguins made some kind of statement?
Yes.
The statement was that you're very lonely and you need a pet.
Huh.
Leslie?
They sent you T-shirts, too.
Oh!
Wow, look, they sent us a T-shirt.
Hmm Mine has a collar on it.
There she is.
Leslie!
Hey!
Hey.
This is my boyfriend, Derek, and this is Derek's boyfriend, Ben.
Hi.
Hey.
Oh!
Wait, sorry, what's the situation?
What do you mean?
How does this work?
Derek is gay, but he's straight for me, but he's gay for Ben, and Ben's really gay for Derek.
And I hate Ben.
It's not that complicated.
No.
Oh.
Yeah.
Sure.
The thing about youth culture is, I don't understand it.
So what can I do for you guys?
They just really wanted to meet you, because you're kind of like their hero now.
Oh, oh, April, please, it was just penguins.
No!
I'm a public servant, and I'm not allowed to take a political stance.
But you did, and it was awesome.
Yeah.
None of the other politicians ever take a stand, and it means a lot to the whole gay community.
It does, and we're gonna have this party tomorrow night at The Bulge, and we had something to ask you.
We really want you to be the guest of honor.
Oh, my.
It'd be amazing if you came.
Yeah, you have to come.
Who made this?
We did.
Yeah, we did.
How?
Photoshop.
What?
Oh!
Computers.
Hey, why are you all dolled up?
It's a long story.
I'm the guest of honor at this gay bar tonight.
I guess gay men are starting to like me.
I don't know.
I guess they think I'm fabulous or something.
Well, you look good, girl.
You're gonna turn somebody tonight.
That was hands-down the best interaction I've ever had with Donna.
Leslie, this is Marcia Langman from the Society For Family Stability Foundation.
Oh, hello.
I love your top.
Oh, thank you so much.
I was just hoping you had a moment to discuss the events at the zoo yesterday.
Well, I have nothing to do with this, so Well, what can I do for you and those fine people at the SFSF?
Well, you could resign, if you're up for it.
Oh, you're serious?
When you performed a marriage for gay penguins, using taxpayer money on government property, you were symbolically taking a stand in favor of the gay marriage agenda.
Oh, I'm sorry, but hold on a second there, Marcia.
That was not my intention, at all.
Well, why else would you marry penguins?
Because I firmly believed that it would be cute.
And it was.
Leslie, are you married?
No.
Not yet, Marcia.
Soon, probably.
I have a plan, but, no, not now.
Not dating anyone yet.
Focusing on my career.
I thought so.
So you couldn't possibly understand, but when gays marry, it ruins marriage for the rest of us.
So, either you annul the wedding, or I'll publicly ask for your resignation.
You know what?
I'm so terrible with directions.
If I'm headed to the parking lot, do I make a left out of here, or do I go right?
It's a left, yeah.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Annul the wedding!
Hey.
Hi!
I'm supposed to meet Leslie for lunch, but she actually works, so Ouch!
Mark was brought to my hospital the night of the accident.
He was here for a week.
I think when his head hit the ground, it must've knocked something loose, because he's actually a pretty nice guy now.
And Andy, after we broke up, he told me he was going to Kansas to climb mountains.
So, I don't really know where he is.
Hey, have you seen that documentary about food yet?
No, I haven't.
But I heard it's really good.
I want to see it.
We should go together.
What?
Yeah, no.
I don't think so.
That would be like a date.
Okay.
Say no more.
Mmm.
I hate salad.
Leslie, I don't want to ever keep secrets from you.
Oh, me, neither.
Look, let's invent our own secret language that only we understand.
And then we can use it around people and no one will know what we're talking about.
Okay.
Okay.
But in the meantime, I'm just gonna tell you in English.
Mark kind of asked me out.
He weirdly asked me to go see a movie with him, and I said no, of course, but I just I just wanted to let you know.
I'm feeling a lot of confusing things right now.
Yeah.
No, of course you are.
And your friendship is the most important thing to me.
And he's off-limits.
Thank you.
I just want to let you know, I was really serious about that secret language.
I know.
I can't believe this is a gay bar.
Yeah, especially with that heterosexual cowboy greeting us on the way in.
Where should I drink now?
There's a bar on Eighth Street called Pitchers and Catchers.
You can go there.
Yeah.
Hey!
Okay, listen.
Here's the plan.
Our position is, we have no position.
So let's just say, "Thank you for the party, "but we regretfully decline your offer to honor me".
Oh, my God, I can't believe you came.
Hi, April.
Derek!
It's Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope, you're my hero!
Oh!
That's nice.
Leslie, you are looking hot.
Really?
Thank you, Ben.
I'm really enjoying this hug.
That's so nice, but I need to tell you something.
This one is on us.
Well, if it's free Leslie Knope!
She's Leslie Knope, and she wants to recruit you!
No, no, no.
Oh, my.
Okay.
Please, please, please, please.
Gentlemen.
First of all, I would just like to say thank you so much for throwing me this party, especially on a night when the Colts are playing.
We love you, Leslie!
Okay.
This is green.
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
Okay!
Well, I wanted to tell you that I wasn't really trying to take a stand when I married those penguins.
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
You're chanting my name.
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
Leslie!
I just have one thing to say!
Together we can change Pawnee forever!
Let's dance!
Leslie Knope's in the building, y'all!
Let's get wild!
I've seen so many dudes from City Hall here tonight, it's crazy.
But I guess they've seen me here, too.
So, that's not great.
Hey!
Hi.
I got your text.
Is everything okay?
Oh, yeah!
They're having a party in my honor!
Go to the bar.
If you're my friend, you can drink for free!
Oh!
Cool!
Okay, and maybe next time don't use the words "medical emergency".
I'm so glad you're here!
I'm really sober!
Okay!
Get a drink!
You know why tonight's fun?
'Cause everyone's so gay.
And they know how to have fun, and the dancing!
Just, it's Everyone is just who they are.
And who they are is just stone-cold gay.
Can't read my Can't read my No, he can't read my poker face Blah, blah, blah, blah My, my, my, poker face My, my poker face My, my, my, poker face My, my poker face I'm having such a nice time tonight.
I've met many interesting people.
And there's two bisexual guys here, and I got both of their phone numbers.
My, my, my poker face My, my poker face My, my, my poker face My, my poker face My, my, my poker face My, my poker face The whole morning.
Show me what's hot Tell me what I got Can't read my Can't read my Have fun last night?
I had three drinks named after me, so that's pretty fun.
Plus, Ben and Derek are taking me shopping on Saturday.
And we are gonna find out my actual bra size.
I guess I'm kind of like queen of the gays.
Bully for you.
I just got a phone call.
They want you to go on Pawnee Today.
Wow.
That's huge.
What's the topic?
You.
That Marcia Langman from the family thing is calling for your resignation.
No!
You gotta go on and defend yourself.
Why?
I haven't even officially taken a stand on gay marriage.
That's funny.
Somebody just told me you were queen of the gays.
That was me.
Pawnee Today, with Joan Callamezzo.
It's kind of like the Meet the Press of our town.
It's the big time, Leslie.
Yeah, I know.
It is.
I'm nervous.
I just wish I were here under different circumstances.
Guess who?
Uh Megan Fox?
One of the Desperate Housewives?
No, Joan Callamezzo.
Hey, Joanie!
What's up, gorgeous?
Good to see you.
Tom comes on the show all the time.
Joan loves him.
You have the softest skin of any woman in Pawnee.
Thank you.
I wish you could reach, from your TV screen, and just touch Joan's skin for a second.
That's sweet.
You'd have a treat.
You're pretty soft yourself.
How are your kids doing?
They're pretty good.
Is it tough for them to have a mother that is so beautiful?
What's it like being the most attractive woman in Pawnee?
You keep up those funnies, I'm gonna have to invite you over for supper.
Well, I'll have to come over for supper.
Oh!
You must.
Oh, my God.
Ann Perkins.
How you doing?
I'm good.
How was mountain climbing?
What?
Can I come in?
I just want to talk to you for a second.
Sure, yeah.
We have a controversial topic today, the gay penguin marriage at the Pawnee Zoo.
So, Marcia, what is all the fuss about?
The fuss is that Miss Knope claimed that she was not advocating for this gay cause, and then that very night, she was the guest of honor at a pro-gay marriage rally at a bar called The Bulge.
Miss Knope, how do you respond?
I'd first like to say that I wasn't trying to advocate for anyone.
I did not know that both of the penguins were males, and I was just trying to perform a cute, fun ceremony to promote our local zoo.
I have to say that that stunt that you did with the penguins was clearly over the line.
Now, Marcia, what, if anything, can Miss Knope do to make it right?
Joan, we don't want to be unreasonable.
Of course not.
We think that she should separate the penguins, annul the marriage, reimburse the taxpayers for the cost of the wedding, of course, and then resign.
Oh!
Is that it?
That would do it.
Anything else?
You want me to jump off a building?
Perform hara-kiri?
Move to a different town?
No, I kid.
Full of ideas here today.
This is the reason why people don't go into politics.
Because, I bust my ass for the people in this city, and I can't win.
I have one night of fun with some of the best dancers I've ever danced with, and suddenly everybody's freaking out?
Wow, look at that!
Wow, we're lighting up here.
Great.
Let's go for it.
Bring it on.
I've never seen that on our show before.
How does this work?
Well, there Push that, and Great.
Okay.
Hey!
You're on the air!
You're on the air!
Good!
Yeah, I think that lady should resign.
Okay, good.
Thank you.
Next caller.
You should resign and repay your salary.
Okay, two for resign.
Thank you.
Next caller.
I just want to say that I love the zoo, and the zoo is really fun.
Thank you.
That's really sweet.
And I think you should resign.
You look great.
You look amazing.
Thanks.
You look fancy.
Oh, yeah, the monkey suit.
Cost 3,000 bucks, but totally worth it.
I sold out!
I got a boring office job in town, so I gotta dress up, you know, the grind.
But I'm really happy, and I really feel like I've matured a lot.
Good!
That's I'm happy for you.
Yeah.
So listen, I was sitting in the cubicle the other day, just doing some thinking, and some growing And some maturing.
Yes!
Maturing.
And darn it if I don't just miss you, and Andy.
Well, A-Cakes, just let me I love you, and I'm just really sorry for the way that I treated you.
I was the worst boyfriend ever, I know that, and I really think it would behoove us to give it another shot.
Yeah, look.
I'm really happy for you about your job and that you've learned some new words, but I'm sure about my decision.
Okay.
Say no more.
Listen, hit me up on my cell phone.
I'll be around.
And if you wanna talk, or grab coffee or something like that.
Okay?
Okay.
Oh.
Gotta get back to the office.
Have a good one.
Good seeing you.
Bye.
And the hardest part about living in this pit is probably keeping my suit pressed.
And the rats.
It's like a freaking rat parade every night.
I just want to be close to her house, because I need to protect her.
'Cause there are some weird people that live around here.
Yeah, if you let penguins get married, where does it end?
I mean, would you let me marry my guinea pig?
Because I really do want to marry my guinea pig.
I'll take my answer off the air.
I think that's a valuable point.
Attendance is up 30% at the zoo, by the way.
You're welcome.
That penguin wedding was cute, damn it.
And I'm not gonna annul it.
I'd ask you to reconsider.
Well, I'd ask you to stop asking me, because it's not gonna happen, Marcia.
Is that right?
Last time I checked, I don't think I murdered anyone, or had an affair, or did drugs!
But I apologize.
I apologize for having fun, and for making something cute!
Where are you from originally?
Oh, no!
What did I do?
So, you will not be annulling the marriage?
No.
I will not be annulling.
No.
Look at them.
They're just in their own little penguin love bubble.
I guess that's what it's like when you meet your mate and know you're gonna be together forever.
Hi!
Hi!
You know what I realized?
What?
We're just animals.
We don't know anything about love.
Okay.
Yeah.
I think you should go on that date with Mark.
Oh, Leslie Really, seriously.
I thought about it, and, look, he might not be my gay penguin, but he could be yours.
Look, I told you I'm not going on a date with him.
Okay, fine.
If you don't want to go out with him, don't go out with him.
But don't not do it because of me, because I'm really fine with it.
All that's important to me is that we're still friends.
Me, too!
Good!
Great.
Plus, I already called him and told him that you were dying to go out with him, so have fun.
Huh?
So, I transferred the penguins to a zoo in lowa.
Gay marriage is legal there, so hopefully, they'll be happy.
At least they'll be together.
Oh, look!
Six Flags!
I should take them on a water slide.
They might die.
But it would be so cute!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
Oh, my God.
I'm so fine with it, Ann.
Seriously.
It's so fine.
As long as you and I are cool.
You know my code.
Hoes before bros.
Uteruses before duderuses.
Got it.
Ovaries before brovaries.
You make such good coffee.
Look, I know you're saying you're okay with it, but I've been in this position before, and I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't, actually.
It was kind of weird.
But the thing is, Mark isn't my ex.
You know, we slept together six years ago.
Anyway, I'm over it.
Or am I?
I'm just kidding.
This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
A community garden, right in the middle of the pit.
We're encouraging people to just come out and plant whatever they want.
And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
It's so hot.
I had to get some more iced tea.
People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
And Tom is our master horticulturist.
He knows all the scientific names for everything.
Right, Tom?
Yeah.
Like this.
What's this, Tom?
Those are, of course, tomatoes, or Soulja Boy Tell 'Ems.
Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of any of our plants, I just give her the names of rappers.
And those over there?
Those are some Diddys.
Those are some Bone Thugs-n-Harmony-ums right here.
Growing beautifully.
Those Ludacrises are coming in great.
Look, someone planted something new.
What's this?
What do you think, carrots?
If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.
Maybe some kind of spice?
Yeah.
You know, Leslie, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, just roll it up into a joint and smoke it.
Ron, did you get my texts?
No.
Did you get my e-mails?
Mmm-mmm.
Did you see that I paged you?
I did not.
Did you check your voicemail?
I didn't.
We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
Okay.
Call the cops.
That'll leak to the press.
Then there'll be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding.
You don't have funding.
And we never will if this gets out.
Look, I will call the cops, but just give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?
Sure.
Thank you.
And listen, if this thing blows up, I was never here.
I have a hernia.
I've had it for a while.
And I've been ignoring it, successfully.
But this morning, I made the mistake of sneezing.
But as long as I sit still and don't move my head, or torso, I'm good, I got this.
We need to find out who we're dealing with.
Who is this person?
Who is this kingpin?
It's a 13-year-old kid named Stevie, who likes to get high, and make his Transformers look like they're having sex together.
I would like to be President someday, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana.
I ate a brownie once.
At a party in college.
It was intense.
It was kind of indescribable, actually.
I felt like I was floating.
Turns out there wasn't any pot in the brownie.
It was just an insanely good brownie.
You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal.
'Cause we flip the headline, and it's not "Community Garden Infested With Pot".
It's "Brave Public Servants Rid Neighborhood of Drugs, "Earn Praise from Mayor, comma, Everyone".
We got to catch this guy.
Get the van, meet me at 7:00.
It's stakeout time.
April?
Yeah?
Get my lunch for me, please.
Okay.
Like, order you something?
No, get it.
From there.
Is this some kind of weird power trip?
Please.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
You're welcome.
I have stakeout supplies.
This is stuff that we're probably going to need.
We have notepads, pencils and pencil case.
Shakable whipped cream.
Cameras.
Pork.
And candy necklaces.
It's like we're real police.
And I made us a mix CD.
It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
It's mostly Sting.
And look, I put our faces on there.
It's really cool.
Are you going to wear that shirt?
Yeah.
You like it?
Tommy Hilfiger?
No.
Tom Haverford.
I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.
Here you go.
Everyone thinks it's Tommy Hilfiger.
Well, here.
You should be wearing something like this.
Take this.
Wear black.
Black is what you wear on a stakeout.
Okay, I have to figure out how this works.
Just let me focus up on this.
Pretty bummed this fits.
Okay, now I need to just take a test shot and see how this goes.
Test shot.
You ready?
Just focus up on the pit.
All right.
Stop.
Focus up right where the Stop.
Focus up right where the weed is Stop.
Stop.
Leslie swears it's okay.
So I'm going out with Mark.
I got to get back out there.
When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie.
And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.
Even when we saw Ratatouille.
Oh, look.
It's Mark.
What are you doing?
What?
I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Good.
Yeah.
Hey, Ann.
Hey.
So, you ready to go?
Oh, no.
I need another hour to get ready.
Seriously?
'Cause I think the movie starts in like Oh, you're joking around right now.
Wow.
This is going to be fun.
Yeah, well, you know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains, too.
Ew!
Silly.
Whoa!
Are they dating now?
Brendanawicz is the man.
This is Brendanawicz's life.
Hot chick from the newspaper, hot chick from the post office, hot chick from the hospital.
Her name's Ann.
You know her name.
Her name's Ann.
I'm just saying.
Nobody turns him down.
I did.
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
We were drunk, and he tried to kiss me, and I said, "No, sir, Mark Brendanawicz.
I don't need your business here".
Get down.
Working late?
Yeah.
Shovel guitar, shovel guitar Somebody wants to play shovel guitar Leslie's been playing shovel guitar for about an hour now.
Longer.
Bucket drum, bucket drum You're not from here, right?
No.
I'm from South Carolina.
But you moved to South Carolina from where?
My mother's uterus.
But you were conceived in Libya, right?
Wow.
No.
I was conceived in America.
My parents are Indian.
Where did the name 'Haverford' come from?
My birth name is Darwish Sabir Ismael Gani, and I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funny-sounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics.
What about Barack Obama?
Okay, yeah, fine, Barack Obama.
If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was going to be elected President, yeah, maybe I wouldn't have changed it.
Oh, did you hear that noise?
Oh, my God.
It's the kingpin!
Write this down.
Okay, white male, light brown hair.
Just take pictures.
Oh, my God, it looks like Andy.
That is Andy.
That is Andy.
Andy is the kingpin.
Andy.
Come here.
Oh, hey, you guys.
What are you doing here?
It's so good to see you.
Quietly.
What happened?
You're living in the pit now?
For now, yeah.
It's awesome.
Somebody just planted a garden down there.
Fruits and vegetables, so I'm getting a lot of vitamins But that's our community garden.
Yeah, and someone planted a whole mess of weed next to the tomatoes.
Oh, don't look at me.
There's weed down there?
I thought that was the tops of carrots.
Right, I know.
Me, too.
Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay?
So why don't you come to the van and help us?
We're trying to catch the guy.
And maybe you could tell us what you've seen.
I was supposed to have a rock fight with this crazy guy.
He's like 20 minutes late.
All right.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Do you live here?
April?
Yeah.
Do you live here?
No.
Catch.
Yeah, I thought so.
I went home, but I had this strange feeling that there was something wrong with you, so I came back.
It's just a minor medical issue.
AIDS?
No.
I'm safe.
Blindness?
No.
Is it like a parasite or a virus or something you get from a bee?
I have a hernia.
Do you have syphilis?
I said it's a hernia.
I know.
It's possible to have two things.
Do you need a ride to the hospital?
Yes, please.
Okay.
But I rode my bike here, so I have to go home and get my dad's station wagon.
Thank you.
Bye.
Are you still here?
Yeah.
I just wanted to see if you could tell.
Are you still here?
It is really great to have somebody to talk to.
Man, oh, man.
So how's Ann?
She's doing good?
Oh, I miss her so much, it's ridiculous.
How's she doing?
Doing good tonight.
She's out on a Ann is great.
And I bet she really misses you.
I'm going to need more of these if I'm going to stay up tonight.
Is that candy?
Yeah, it's a necklace, made out of candy.
You want one?
Oh, all right.
Great.
All I've had is fruits and vegetables, for weeks now.
Hmm.
Oh, my God!
You know, there's a string in there.
Not in this one.
Instant sugar high!
Sugar high!
Sugar hit high!
Sugar high!
High!
Oh!
Are you okay?
Sugar slam!
Maybe we should get you something more substantial to eat.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm in.
Hey, bring me back two cheeseburgers and a green tea.
Oh, come on.
You got to be kidding me.
So, that was fun.
Yeah.
It really was.
Surprisingly fun.
You know what?
I have been a perfect gentleman this evening.
In fact, watch this.
I would like you to now please invite me in for a nightcap.
Not a chance.
No, no, no.
Just Watch what I'm going to do.
Oh, okay.
Just ask me in for a nightcap.
Will you come in for a nightcap?
Yes, I will.
No, no!
Damn!
Drat!
I was going to plan to not Wait, wait, wait.
To say no.
Look, that guy's trying to break into that van.
You know what, it does look like he's breaking into that van.
I just 9- 1-1.
Hi, there.
So, Andy, do you, like, spy on Ann from the pit?
No.
No.
I just like being nearby.
That way, if she wants me back, I can be at her house, like, in two seconds, before she changes her mind.
I don't really know how healthy that is.
I mean, you guys aren't even dating anymore.
She might be dating somebody else.
Is she?
What?
Is she dating somebody else?
Huh?
What?
You just said Ann might be dating somebody else.
Is she?
I didn't say that.
Who is she dating?
Nobody.
Mark.
That's cool.
Oh, my God!
I'm at the vehicle now.
How you doing tonight, sir?
I'm all right, Officer.
How are you?
I'm responding to a 9-1-1 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.
I need you to step out and show me some ID.
No, it's okay.
My name is Tom Haverford.
I work for the Parks Department.
I just got locked out of the van.
I had to jimmy my way back in.
Well, why don't you jimmy your way out and show me some ID.
Well, I just told you my ID.
So, what's the crime here?
Parking while Indian?
No, there's no stereotypes about Indians sitting in vehicles.
All right, fine.
Here's my ID.
Nice job, Paul Blart.
Why don't you head back to the mall, make sure nobody's breaking into Lady Foot Locker?
Hey.
I'm very close right now to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
Step out of the van.
I'll step out of your mama's van.
I didn't do anything!
I'm a city employee, man!
Come on!
Leslie!
Motion sensors.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me!
What are you doing?
What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Cops took him.
What?
Oh, my God!
Ann and Mark!
Andy!
It's Ann and Mark!
Andy?
Leslie?
Oh!
Leslie Knope.
Hey!
Hey!
Wow.
We caught a criminal.
Do you know about this?
Yeah, he was breaking into this van and they dragged him away.
It was crazy.
Right here.
What are you doing here?
If you could just stop writing for a second, and just focus here, because Ma'am, ma'am, as I've told you several times already, this is a police matter.
Well, it doesn't seem to matter to the police!
Okay.
Nice job with that.
But let's Let me ask you a question.
Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they try to get into their own van?
No.
And thankfully, that's not what happened.
Now, could you please go home, and get some sleep, and let this matter be resolved.
Thank you, Officer.
Let's just go home, Leslie.
Yeah, let's go home.
Let's just go home.
No!
No!
Let's just go home.
No!
Easy!
No.
No, no, no, no, no!
Leslie Okay, come with me, please.
Fine.
I'd like to come with you.
Your friend, he acted like an ass.
And you got to believe me, he didn't give me a choice.
Your name's Dave, right?
Can I call you Dave?
My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on it 50-50.
Hate to break it to you, Dave.
You really stepped in it.
What?
I'm a government employee, David, and so is your prisoner.
If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here, kicking down your doors.
Yeah, that's right.
You heard me.
Ron Swanson.
What branch of government are you in?
Parks and Recreation.
Parks and Recreation?
Yes.
Do I stutter?
Look, Ms. Knope, it wasn't just his behavior, okay?
I think your friend might be some kind of a pervert.
No.
Look, that's what people think when they first meet him, but he's all talk.
It's just No, I'm being serious.
We searched the van and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date.
We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy.
Okay, look.
Tom and I were in that van together.
We were staking out the community garden, because somebody planted marijuana in it.
I brought the candy and I brought a lot of it, because I love candy.
I took the pictures.
My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
It's been a very long night.
But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail.
Well, they're going to release him in a little while.
Thank God.
Should I get you guys home right now?
You know, you two go ahead.
I'm going to stay here and wait for Tom.
Are you sure?
Yeah, prison changes a man.
I think he'll probably want to see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Well, okay, then.
See you, Leslie.
Yo.
I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
You ready?
I was born ready.
I'm Ron Swanson.
Easy.
Care Careful.
Take Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in.
Terrible things happened last time.
So, I guess I'll just see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
Hey.
You kind of kissed me.
Yes, I did!
And now we both have herpes.
I'll see you later.
Leslie.
Thanks for waiting.
I appreciate it.
Mother Teresa, it's not your chocolate.
Don't Get your hands off that.
Wake up.
What?
Is this your house?
Where are we?
Hey.
You're awake.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for the coat.
It's no problem.
You can keep it.
Really?
Actually, no.
I need that for my uniform.
But I can give you a ride back to your car.
Okay.
And we'll talk about the coat.
I can't give it to you.
Do you understand?
Okay.
So, where's that marijuana at?
It's down in the garden.
Good meeting you, man!
We should grab a drink or something sometime.
I just hope that Ann and Mark got home okay.
That's all that matters, you know?
That Ann is home and she's okay.
And that Mark is also okay and he is in his home.
Just important that they're both in their homes Leslie.
Mark's an idiot.
You can do a lot better than him.
Forget about him.
Thanks, Tom.
I didn't mean me.
Keep it in your pants, Knope.
I swear to God, it actually It was there These are carrots.
Duh!
You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Is that the house there, where your best friend lives?
Where she saw the van from?
Yeah.
Okay.
I get it.
What?
Well, you wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date.
No, I did not.
There actually was weed here It's okay.
I think it's kind of cute.
I like Miss Knope.
I liked her.
I got to say, I When I first met her I didn't care much for her, because like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable.
Miss Knope was attractive to me.
As a man, I was attracted to her in her demeanor.
I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
Can we not I don't want to talk about this anymore.
What a crazy night.
Huh, partner?
Want to go get some breakfast?
What?
No!
Take me home.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on.
I wonder if mini golf is open.
Home!
Especially if you're going to I know.
Anndanawicz!
What're you guys doing?
Eating?
Love it.
Oh, hey, just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night.
That was cool.
Peace!
We didn't think you were a pervert, we thought you were a criminal.
For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Good morning, everyone.
A couple of announcements.
As we all know, Ron is recovering from his hernia surgery.
So I got him flowers from all of us.
So everybody needs to pitch in, like, $90.
$90?
Yes, because I ordered a beautiful bouquet of daffodils, from a website, after a few glasses of wine.
So, Tom, I think you might be getting some daffodils, too.
Donna, you're definitely getting some.
Jerry?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
Time will tell.
Also, I'm leaving early tonight because I am a judge in the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You get to be a judge in that thing?
Yes, and it's a responsibility I take very seriously.
But I want to be a judge.
I can't believe you like beauty pageants.
April, whoever Miss Pawnee is, is gonna be the representative of womanhood in our town.
And as a judge, let me assure you that this year's Miss Pawnee will be chosen for her talent and poise.
Whoa.
The girls from Talent and Poise gonna be there?
What?
Talent and Poise.
It's the strip club by the VA hospital.
I have some meetings there.
That's disgusting.
No.
What's disgusting is the Glitter Factory.
Do not go to the Glitter Factory.
Hey!
Hey!
So, I was just at The Grind and I thought you might want an iced mocha with extra, extra whipped cream.
Oh, my.
Thank you so much, April.
Wow!
You're welcome.
Oh, by the way, completely unrelated, I just signed up for the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant.
That's wonderful.
You know, that is why I decided to become a judge.
So that awesome girls like you, who are not, you know, classically hot, can be rewarded for their intelligence and savvy.
Beauty pageants are idiotic.
But I found out that the winner of the Miss Pawnee Pageant gets $600.
I can be idiotic for $600.
So, are you gonna vote for me, sister?
April, it's unethical for me to show you favoritism.
You and I are like family.
The coffee is $7.
Yes.
Right.
Of course.
Just bump that clown.
Tell them they already have another Asian judge.
Awesome.
Thank you so much, I owe you.
All right.
Peace.
Guess who's also gonna be a judge in the beauty pageant?
What?
How?
I know a guy.
I had to call in a few favors.
But if you don't call in favors to look at women in bikinis and assign them numerical grades, what the hell do you call in favors for?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
What you doing in these parts?
I just came by to see the murals.
This one's pretty amazing.
Yeah, this one's a beauty.
You know, in the 1880s, there were a few years that were pretty rough and tumble in Pawnee.
This depicts kind of a famous fight between Reverend Bradley and Anna Beth Stevenson, a widowed mother of seven.
The original title of this was "A Lively Fisting".
But you know, they had to change it for obvious reasons.
She's got him by the hair pretty good there.
Yeah.
Leslie's really cool, and she's smart.
It's a little intimidating.
To tell you the truth, I didn't come here to look at the murals.
I came to ask her on a date.
Hey, Leslie, I really like you.
And I was wondering if maybe you'd want to get a cup of coffee or something, sometime.
Okay, yeah, sure.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Let me check my schedule.
Okay.
Let's see.
Is that your grandma?
Yeah.
That's Madeleine Albright.
That's her name?
'Cause I usually just call mine "Nana".
No, that's Madeleine Albright.
The first female Secretary of State.
Okay, so, not That's not your grandma, then.
All right.
I got it.
How's that schedule looking?
Good, a couple days are free.
Maybe we could just, you know Just lock it in later?
Yeah.
Talk later about it?
Yeah.
That's a good idea.
Okay.
Ladies.
You want to hear something awful?
He didn't even know who Madeleine Albright was.
Who?
Not you, too.
Madeleine Albright, the first female Secretary of State.
No, no, no.
Who didn't know?
Oh, Dave.
That cop that I met.
I don't know.
I just don't know if I can date someone who doesn't share my interests.
I mean, could you date someone who doesn't love giving vaccinations?
I've never dated anyone who loves giving vaccinations.
Hey.
Hey.
Weird question for you.
Are you handy?
Like, can you fix things?
Well, what's broken?
My shower.
It's leaky, low pressure, just all around terrible.
Easy.
You want me to come over after work?
Yes.
Yes.
Amazing.
I will cook you a cheap, quick dinner that will be no trouble at all for me.
Great.
Well, I'll see you tonight, for the weirdest second date ever.
Okay.
Hello, fellow judges.
I am Judge Leslie Knope and this is my colleague, Tom Haverford.
He's also gonna be a judge.
Hi.
Jessica Wicks, Miss Pawnee 1994.
I recognized you right away.
And may I say that you look even more beautiful now than you did when you won the crown.
Ooh, I like you!
Hello.
Ray Holstead, Ray's Sandwich Place.
Yes, of course, Ray.
How do you do?
Fine.
I'm Charles Woliner.
I've judged every Miss Pawnee Pageant for the last 30 years.
I made Jessica.
Well, Tom and I are very happy to be here.
And I'm sure between the five of us, we will choose the most well-rounded, intelligent, modern and forward-thinking woman to represent our fine town.
Right, Tom?
Tom?
You don't believe me?
Watch.
I'm just kidding.
You're perfect, each and every one of you.
God bless.
Here they are, your candidates for Miss Pawnee.
Well, let's meet the girls, shall we?
First up, please welcome April Ludgate.
Hello, I'm April Ludgate.
I'm 20 years old.
I like people, places and things!
And Pawnee is my favorite place in the world!
Next up, please welcome Susan Gleever.
Hi, everyone.
I'm Susan.
I'm a history major at Indiana State, I play classical piano, and I volunteer at the Children's Hospital.
Thank you, Susan.
She's good.
Next, Trish lanetta.
Hi, y'all.
I'm Trish.
I'm 22 years old, I've been on YouTube.
I just I love to hang out with my friends, I love to laugh, I love the summertime and going to the beach, and I love wearing bikinis at the beach with everyone there.
I just want everyone Well, you know, they can't all be winners.
Are y'all having a good time?
Looks like we got a frontrunner, guys!
And now it's time for our ever popular talent competition, where our ladies will each demonstrate their excellent skills.
Here we have Leslie's custom scorecard, with categories such as, presentation, intelligence, knowledge of herstory, fruitful gestures, je ne sais quoi, and something called "The Naomi Wolf Factor".
And our first one up is Trish lanetta, whose talent is baton.
My girl Trish is talented.
She's not even twirling the baton.
I'm going to do impressions.
Oh, celebrity impressions.
That's wild.
Wild stuff.
Yeah.
This is an impression of my sister.
Hi, I'm Natalie.
I love Ritalin and have low self-esteem.
Thank you.
This is an impression of my boss, Leslie Knope.
Women should do everything.
Check out my four-color pen.
Hey, everybody.
Listen up while I talk about some really important stuff.
Parks, parks, parks, parks, parks, parks, Michelle Obama, parks.
Gay penguins, parks, sugar, parks.
She got me.
She got me good.
She got Ooh It's so good, it's so good It's so good, it's so good, it's so good I'm texting Trish to tell her how good she did earlier.
No, Susan isn't a perfect 10.
But in my mind, Susan is the perfect Miss Pawnee.
Her values are strong, her commitment to her job is very admirable, she has a real sense of Hey, hey!
Over here.
How's it going in here?
Good.
I hooked your toilet up to your shower.
That's what you wanted, right?
Yes.
Excellent.
Was that Andy?
Andy?
I know you're in there because I can see you through the screen.
Ann!
Hey!
What's up?
What are you doing?
Do you live down here?
What?
What?
Yes.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you live down here.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this is happening!
What?
I can't be at my house and see my ex-boyfriend living in a hole in my backyard like a gopher.
That's so weird, Andy.
Listen, I have been trying really hard not to bother you.
Like, when you had that barbecue last week, I didn't come up, even though it smelled so good.
You've been here a whole week?
Yes.
One week only.
Oh, I guess I guess that's the office you were telling me about that you go to work to every day.
Excellent.
Listen.
Are we gonna talk about anything other than the lies that I told you?
I can't do this right now.
I have a guy fixing my bathroom.
I got to go.
Yeah, that's cool.
I got to zoom out, too, 'cause I have some people coming over.
So, why don't you call first next time?
You know the way out.
All right, it's time now for the dreaded Q&A.
And the first question goes to Tom Haverford.
Yes, I have a question for the hot one.
First off, I just want to say I'm a little bit surprised, because I didn't think angels could fly so low.
Thank you.
You truly are a beautiful, beautiful woman.
You're so funny.
You're funny.
You're funny.
Do you have a question, Tom?
Okay, I have a real question, if you don't mind, Tom.
Trish, Alexis de Tocqueville called America "The Great Experiment".
What can we do as citizens to improve on that experiment?
Well, uh, I think that America is the land of the free, which is a wonderful thing, and also the brave, where people can live, and no one can ever take that away from you and it never gives up.
But the high birthing rate of immigrants frightens me.
No offense to anyone out there, but if it were up to me and my family, I would actually call it "Our-merica," and not "Their-merica".
Thank you.
Don't applaud that.
No, she didn't She didn't answer my question.
I'm sorry, you don't think it's weird that my ex-boyfriend lives in a tent in the pit outside my house?
It's not ideal.
Maybe you should try to relax.
Maybe take one of those Ativans I saw in the medicine cabinet.
Dude!
Yeah, I peeked.
I also didn't see any toothpaste.
Do you not use toothpaste?
I mean, I always knew he was lazy, but this is, like, a new low for him.
I feel like we should invite him inside.
Have you not been listening to anything I just said?
I don't know, it's just It's raining outside, and he's living in a pit, you know?
Okay, folks, just a couple more contestants, and then the judges will decide our next Miss Pawnee, a winner of $600 in gift certificates to Big Archie's Sporting Goods and Emerson Fencing Company.
What?
We don't get cash?
This is for a fence?
Well, it won't cover a whole fence.
But it will defray the cost considerably!
Oh, my God.
I quit.
I quit.
Okay, I guess she really is quitting.
No, I didn't win.
But at least I didn't make any new friendships.
So, how long do we have to pretend to deliberate until we go back out there?
What do you mean?
We're all in agreement.
The hot one, by a landslide.
Well, her name is Trish.
And I don't think we should rush this, you know?
What is there to talk about?
I mean, I thought Trish was just adorable.
Well, take Susan, for example.
I think Susan Boring Stories?
No.
It's Trish.
Let's go back out there.
Okay, hold on, everyone.
Hold on.
Everyone, wait, wait, wait.
Look, whoever we choose is going to represent the ideal woman for a year.
She'll be someone that little girls in South Central Indiana look up to.
Now, nobody leaves this room until we discuss all of it.
Okay?
Consider yourselves sequestered.
I'm a judge, so I don't want to sound partial.
But Trish will win this pageant over my dead body.
Look, I am the only one here who has entered and won this contest in the past.
And I think Trish is a no-brainer.
Jessica, may I ask, what was your talent?
Oh, I packed a suitcase.
I have to say, Leslie does make a good point.
Trish is not the brightest bulb in the bunch.
Yes, Ray.
Good, I like what you're saying.
Let's keep talking.
Just stand over there and don't drip on anything.
Is Mark the guy who's "fixing your shower"?
I don't know about you, Mark, but I've seen a ton of porn.
And I know what "fixing your shower" means.
Andy Sorry, you guys are on a date.
That's cool.
Andy?
No, it's all right.
Don't let me interrupt your date.
Keep eating.
I already ate.
I'm super full.
I don't I don't want any.
Okay, so, it's still 3-2 for Trish.
Guys, all I ask is that you look into your hearts, and think, really think, about what you've seen and ask yourselves, "Who is the most impressive woman here tonight"?
It's the hot one.
Trish lanetta!
These are amazing.
Do you Do you put a little hot sauce on these or something?
A good chef never reveals her secrets.
It's hot sauce.
Ann is an extraordinary cook.
Mmm.
Memories.
Do you want some more?
Are you hungry still?
You know what's funny?
I was just sitting over here on the couch and I was thinking, that there was once a time when Mark used to be the stranger in the house.
And now it's me.
Excuse me, everyone.
Why don't we just take a moment to give a round of applause to all the contestants this evening?
Yes.
Especially Susan.
This isn't the first time that Susans have lost to Trishes, and it won't be the last.
Susan and I will continue on until the women of Pawnee are judged not by the flatness of their tummies, but by the contents of their brains.
And, Trish, I may not have voted for you, but now is the time for us to come together.
I hope you honor this crown with dignity, and a devotion to all One, two, three!
One, two, three!
As usual, Ann, a delicious meal.
Are we doing anything in the way of dessert or coffee?
We are leaving.
Okay, I get it.
Don't worry.
I'm very good at picking up signals.
Let's go, Mark.
No, dummy.
Just you.
Okay.
All right.
Take care of yourself.
Just don't worry about me, Ann.
Okay?
I'll be fine.
That went really well!
We had dinner!
I got to see her!
Oh, God, I was so tempted to look back at her.
Was she looking?
I had to walk so slow.
A good day.
Well, well, well, look who's here.
It's Officer John McClane.
Welcome to the party, pal.
Who's that?
Die Hard.
The battery?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Well, you know the other day I asked you if you wanted to have coffee?
Yeah.
You said yes.
Yes.
Okay, and then afterwards, I saw you again, you kind of acted like you didn't want to have coffee anymore.
We left it kind of open-ended.
We did.
And that's made me uncomfortable.
Okay.
So I thought I'd come in and ask you, and just get some clearance on this.
Dave, I like you.
I like you, too.
Okay, so, we'll get coffee, then.
But I'm just busy.
Right now, my schedule is just so full.
Okay.
Okay, I get it.
Look, I'm not a guy who plays games.
Okay, I just came to tell you that I like you, and I like coffee and I If you want to get some coffee, here's my number.
Hey, coming through, buddy.
Hey.
I got your message.
Hey.
Thanks for coming.
Look, I'd love to go out with you.
How about Friday for dinner?
Yeah?
Great.
Hey, will Sandra Day O'Connor and Michelle Obama and Condoleezza Rice and Nancy Pelosi, are they gonna join us?
No, they will not be joining us.
Okay, well, good, 'cause I don't happen to agree with Miss Pelosi's views about the Troubled Assets Relief Program.
Hmm.
I looked that up to impress you.
I figured.
Yeah.
If you guys like grilling, you want to come over and use my grill Look, let me do you a favor.
Take a key.
Just come by, grill up whatever you want.
This is one of my favorite pick-up strategies.
I'm constantly giving one of my keys.
This is your house key?
Yeah.
I just happened to have a spare.
Just come by, go for a dip, whenever you want.
So far, none of them have shown up.
That's a very appealing offer, thank you.
Matter of time.
Hey, Craig.
Hey, Tommy.
Fifty more copies, please.
You got it.
I have been robbed twice.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
And to my wife, I apologize.
All I can say is I wasn't just having sex, I was making love to a beautiful woman and her boyfriend, and a third person, whose name I never learned.
Furthermore, it was wrong of me to say I was building houses for the underprivileged, when I was actually having four-way sex in a cave in Brazil.
I bet cave sex is insane.
Why?
Because of the echoes and the humidity.
Mmm-hmm.
In my defense, it was my birthday and I really wanted to do it.
I think it's a real shame when people focus on the tawdry details of a scandal.
Personally, all I care about is Councilman Dexhart's policies.
Not whether he was high on nitrous and cocaine during the cave sex.
Which, by the way, I heard he was.
One more shocking revelation in a story that just won't stop unfolding.
It turns out Councilman Dexhart may have also had sex with a prostitute in the limousine on the way to and from the press conference where he apologized for having an affair.
Perd Hapley, Channel Four Eyewitness News.
Why does anybody wanna run for public office?
You're just asking to have your entire life exposed.
Well, if you're squeaky clean, like I am, there's no problem.
Tom, you're married, and you hit on women constantly.
Yeah, but I've never sealed the deal.
Just window-shopping.
You can fly to Brazil, just don't enter the cave.
Am I right?
Up top!
I'm sure that you think that you're clean, but I bet that we could find something on you.
I changed my name, which is legal, and once in high school, a girl beat me in a wrestling match.
That's it.
I bet anything I could find worse stuff on all you guys.
Are you suggesting a game?
I'm in.
I'm in.
I'm out.
Not an option, Jerry.
You're going down.
No, seriously, I really don't wanna play.
No, no.
Seriously, you are playing.
We're gonna nail you.
I will play, too, if only to prove that I can find more dirt on you than you can on me.
That's why we're all playing.
Your desk is over there.
I love games that turn people against each other.
You guys will never believe what I just found on Jerry's Facebook.
A friend.
Burn.
Okay, again, I'd really rather not play.
Hey, guys.
What are you guys doing?
Trying to see who has the least amount of dirt on them in case someone wants to run for office.
Well, it ain't Jerry.
That's for sure.
What?
Well, he's got a couple of 359s on him.
Public urination.
I don't like this game.
I just don't like it.
He's probably gonna go anger-pee in the courtyard.
Well, you crazy park people, I'm out of here.
Leslie, I'll see you tomorrow.
Tomorrow, will be our first official First date.
Roger that.
Copy.
Over and out.
Dave and I are going on our first date tomorrow.
I'm not nervous.
Why should I be nervous?
We're just two people going on a first date.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
That was my phone.
Hey.
Hey.
Hi there.
What are you What are you doing here?
Just having lunch with Leslie.
What are you up to?
Oh, I'm looking for scandalous information about my co-workers, for a game that we're playing.
My taxes pay your salary, right?
Yeah.
Cool.
And he looked up at me, and he said, "Thank you.
You saved my life".
Yeah.
Hey, listen, I'm really nervous about this date tomorrow night.
Do you have, like, a first date outfit I can borrow?
Like, I don't know, a pair of cargo pants?
Yeah, I wouldn't go with a cargo pant.
What about, like, a sexy hat?
I don't know what that even is.
Helping already.
Do you wanna just come by after work today?
Sure.
Yeah.
Tonight?
Several hours from now?
Or you could just come over now?
I think that would be better.
Yeah, that would give us more time.
Let's go.
Oh, what you doing, guys?
Looking for dirt on me?
No point.
Give up now.
Oh, wait, there's this.
Everybody, I bought a Croissan'wich this morning.
This isn't even a real receipt.
Just a scrap of paper.
Taliban robes!
What?
Where'd you get that photo from?
Hey, Tom.
Nice Taliban robes.
Those aren't Taliban robes.
That's from Halloween, 10 years ago.
I was dressed like a Jedi.
I'm sure that the voters would be able to tell the difference.
Mmm, looks to me like you're in the Taliban.
Well, did everybody know that Ron's ex-wife, Tammy, is actually his second ex-wife named Tammy?
That's right.
Ron has two ex-wives, each named Tammy.
Both of them bitches.
Yes, my mom's name is Tammy.
What's your point?
Tom, that was a Jaeger-secret.
You just breached a Jaeger-secret.
Damn, this just heated up quick!
Ta-da!
That looks great.
Yeah?
Will you be wearing it out of the store today, madame?
I think I will, good lady.
Hey, while I have you, can I ask you a question?
Shoot.
What if he asks me if I've been married?
Have you?
No.
Well, then, say that.
But then he'll wonder why I haven't been married.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna say that I was married.
The real question is, should I say that I have kids.
Guys like girls that have kids, right?
Whoa!
What if I get drunk and I talk about Darfur too much?
Or not enough?
What if I don't bring up Darfur enough?
Leslie, relax.
Yeah.
Okay?
I just have a few more questions for you, Ann.
What if he shows up with another woman?
What if one of my sleeves catches on fire and it spreads rapidly?
What if instead of Tic Tacs, I accidentally pop a couple of Ambien and I have to keep punching my leg to stay awake?
Those are all insane hypotheticals.
And I promise you they won't happen.
They have happened.
All of these have happened to me.
No, there's more.
One time, I accidentally drank an entire bottle of vinegar.
I thought it was terrible wine.
Once I went out with a guy who wore 3D glasses the entire evening.
Oh, one time I rode in a sidecar on a guy's motorcycle, and the sidecar detached and went down a flight of stairs.
Another time, I went to a really boring movie with a guy, and while I was asleep, he tried to pull out one of my teeth.
I literally woke up with his hand in my mouth.
We went out a couple times after that, but then he got weird.
I know it sounds crazy, I'm a grown woman, but I am just not good on first dates.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
You have a problem, and this is how we're gonna fix it.
I know what you're thinking.
I wear an earpiece, you sit at a table nearby, you speak into a mic, you tell me what to say on the date.
But let me tell you something, Ann, it never works.
No, no, no.
We are gonna go to a restaurant and have a practice date.
I will pretend to be Dave, and you will practice on me.
That's a way better idea.
Hey, Dave, it's me.
It's Leslie.
Hi, Leslie.
It's good to see you.
Hi!
You don't wanna do that quite yet.
So, Dave.
Let's begin our conversation.
What's on the note cards?
They're possible topics of conversation.
"Whales, parades, electricity".
And the rest are blank.
Yeah, well, I couldn't think of anything else.
Leslie's in worse shape than I thought.
Is she practice-laughing?
Oh, Dave You!
The Danish call it "op og ned apparat," which literally translated means the "up and down machine".
Wow, that's a thorough history of the teeter-totter.
Now I'm gonna talk about the local flora and fauna found in Pawnee.
Okay.
What's amazing You know what?
Just ask me a question.
Just try to get to know me.
Okay.
I can't think of anything to ask you.
I'm sorry.
My mind is blank.
Just ask me the first thing that comes to your head.
How big is it?
Really?
Oh, my God.
Hey, Tommy.
Hi.
Hey.
Are you ready?
Yes, I am.
Just give me one second.
Hey, Donna.
Let me ask you something.
Do you hate black people?
Excuse me?
'Cause, apparently, in 1988, you donated money to the presidential campaign for David Duke.
The KKK guy?
I got a phone call.
They said he would lower taxes.
Boom!
How's it feel to lose so hard?
I'm sorry, honey.
Let's get coffee.
Ree-Ron!
You remember my wife, Wendy Haverford.
Of course.
Yeah, hi.
How are things at the hospital?
Very good, thank you.
I just got a pediatric surgery fellowship.
Nice.
We're celebrating, 'cause she's super rich and super hot also.
Okay.
Come on, Tommy.
Cut it out.
You're super hot.
Everybody else has to deal with it.
Let's get out of here.
See you later, Ron.
I've established a scientifically perfect 10-point scale of human beauty.
Wendy is a 7.4, which is way too high for Tom, who is a 3.8.
Ten is tennis legend Steffi Graf.
Hi, Dave.
You're late.
And I can see your nipples through your dress.
What?
No.
Really?
In nursing school, we took a psych course on how to treat phobias with a method called "exposure therapy".
So, like, if you were afraid of snakes, they would immerse you in a tank of snakes.
So, I am going to immerse Leslie in a tank of bad date.
You're 20 minutes late, I almost left.
Okay.
God!
Well, I was dropping my niece off.
What's your niece's name?
Torple.
What?
I don't know.
That's not a name.
I don't have a niece.
My niece's name is Stephanie.
Stop lying.
Hey, look.
There's bread.
You want some?
Oh, no!
I got flowers in your soup.
I'm so sorry.
Come on!
Just I have to go to the whiz palace.
You know, Dave, the place where you You know, the toilet thing.
It's a bathroom!
It's called a bathroom!
Hey, Mark.
A little birdie told me that you have one unpaid parking ticket.
Well, that's funny, because a little birdie told me that your adoptive mother was arrested for marijuana possession.
Oh, snap!
What?
You didn't know that, huh?
I didn't know I was adopted.
Oh, no.
Oh, Jerry.
Oh, Jerry.
I'm so sorry.
I really didn't wanna play.
You That was not my intention.
It's not your fault.
He totally baited you with that unpaid parking ticket.
Tom, could you come into my office?
Tom-ato sauce.
Ron-tonamo Bay.
Do be seated and congratulate me.
For what?
Winning the game.
I just found out, through some pretty impressive investigating, that your wedding was a sham.
It's a green card marriage.
That's crazy.
I was born in South Carolina.
These colors don't run, baby.
Yes, but Wendy was born in Ottawa, Canada.
Her visa was set to expire the day after you got married at the county courthouse in front of three strangers and no family.
Okay.
We met in college.
She wanted to work in the States, she couldn't get a permit I knew it.
I knew you couldn't get a wife as hot as her.
Seriously, Ron.
Games aside, you gotta keep this between us.
Don't tell anybody, please.
Now, come on.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna turn you in.
Just admit that when it comes to digging up dirt, I bested you in this game.
Say it.
Say, "I bested you".
Fine.
You bested me.
Is that all?
No.
I'll have your wife tonight.
What?
I'm just kidding.
Get out of here.
Why would you say that, Dave?
That dog was, like, my best friend.
And when she died, it was one of Bring, bring, bring, bring, bring.
Hey, Tiffany.
Yeah, I definitely wanna see you tonight.
No, I can't really talk right now, 'cause I'm on a date with this drip.
Yeah, I can ask.
Hey, do you wanna watch a porno after this with me and my wife?
No, Dave.
'Cause you're disgusting.
So, it's definitely a no?
I don't understand why you're being so terrible.
We're just two people trying to go on a date.
It's supposed to be fun.
It's just a date.
You're right, it is.
Well done.
Sorry I had to get all medical on you.
But now you see that even if everything goes wrong, you'll survive.
Well, well, well.
You coy bastard.
Mark.
Tom.
You hate Ron, right?
No.
I think Ron is fine.
So, we're on the same page.
You gotta help me take this guy down.
There's gotta be something on him.
Tom, I'm starting to feel kind of gross about this game.
It's not about the game anymore.
Ron has some serious dirt on me.
I need to balance things out.
You must know how that feels, you got tons of dirt in your past.
Please, you gotta help me.
There is a man named Duke Silver.
He hangs out at a bar in Eagleton.
He's an old friend of Ron's, maybe you should ask him.
Thanks, man.
I'm gonna dig up so much dirt on this guy, there's gonna be worms all over the place.
It sounded snappier in my head.
Yeah.
Ann is so awesome.
I'm lucky to have a friend who would spend a whole day being so mean to me.
Catch.
I don't need your dress anymore, I'm gonna wear my own stuff.
Me-power.
Good.
You're officially first date-proof.
Thank you, Dave.
Listen, it is impossible that he's not gonna like you.
He's gonna freak out about how awesome you are.
No, he's not.
Yes, he is.
He's gonna love you.
You're cool and you're sexy and you're funny and you're smart Yeah.
Look, any guy would be lucky to date you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hell, yeah.
Yeah.
Hells, yeah!
Yeah.
I am awesome.
You are awesome.
Yeah, and you are, too.
Thank you.
You are, too.
Thank you.
You are, too, Ann.
Okay.
You're awesome.
You're awesome.
Help, police!
Help!
Help!
Hey.
Look, I know today is today, and it's not tomorrow, but I felt like you should know that I'm awesome, and you're lucky to have me.
And I think our first date tomorrow is gonna go awesome, off-the-charts amazing.
Up top.
All right, let's do this, bitch!
I'm not scared.
Can I come and sit down for a little bit?
'Cause I walked here, 'cause The drinking.
I don't know I do know.
I'm coming inside.
So, move, okay?
You make a better door than a guy.
Hey.
This is gonna sound weird.
I'm looking for a guy named Duke Silver.
Yeah, he goes on in a second.
Ladies, ladies, ladies, it's just about that time.
It's with the jazziest pleasure that I bring out for you, my man, Mr. Duke Silver!
Thank you, Dwayne.
As always, it is a thrill to be here, during this witching hour with you lovely ladies.
Now, relax, and let the Duke Silver Trio take you on a little journey to yourself.
Ann was helping me because I was panicking about tomorrow.
Well, did I say something to make you worry about No, no.
Just the whole idea of first dates just kind of freak me out.
But not anymore.
I can't even believe that I was scared to go on a date with you.
I mean, you should be scared of me.
Okay.
I think I need to return this sweater.
I think it fused with my shirt in the dryer or something.
Okay, I think that's a sweater-shirt combo.
I think it's going pretty well with Dave.
He wants me.
I can totally tell that he wants me.
I'm right here.
You know I'm here, right?
Did you see my bra?
Mmm?
Bee, boop.
Guess what?
I'm wearing the hot one tomorrow, the black one.
Okay.
Can I use your bathroom?
Yes.
Are you impressed that I know what it's called?
Look, maybe I ought to give you a lift home.
Good.
Well, in London, they call elevators "lifts".
So, you're gonna give me an elevator home?
No, thank you.
Okay.
Let's Let's go.
Okay?
Okay.
Let's go Okay.
down to the pub That's right.
To the pub.
get a pint.
Yes.
We'll put our knickers in The Beatles records.
Okay, yeah.
That's This is an English accent.
What I cannot believe is Dexhart's wife.
I mean, how clueless can you get?
How did she not know this was going on?
More importantly, how does she stay with him after all this?
I think Dexhart's credibility Hey.
Can I help you at 11:48 p. m?
Okay, here's the whole thing.
Here are all my skeletons.
When I was 16, I had sex with a married woman.
Right.
When I was in college, I smoked a decent amount of pot.
Uh-huh.
Nothing insane.
When I tell you what What the hell are you doing?
What I'm doing is, I'm trying to tell you that I've done some stuff that I'm not very proud of.
But I like you.
So, I would rather you not find out about this from anyone but me.
This was a bad idea.
No, no.
It's fine.
I get what this is, and why you did it.
Is there anything that you would like to share from your past, to sort of balance the scales?
Yeah.
One time this guy rang my doorbell at midnight, to brag about getting laid when he was 16, so I shot him.
Good night.
It's been a real gift making sonic love to you tonight.
If you want more of the Duke, both my albums are for sale here, Smooth As Silver and Hi Ho, Duke.
And look for my new CD next month, The Memories of Now.
So, come see me, come talk to me, come love with me, and maybe we can walk through fire together.
Thank you.
Good night.
Duke!
Huge fan.
Look, Tom.
I imagine you'll wanna tell everyone about this, but I have worked pretty hard to cultivate a certain authoritative, or intimidating image around the office Can I Can I get a picture?
Sure.
Say, "I bested you"!
I bested you.
All right.
Thanks for loving the Duke.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That That was a lovely photo.
Truce?
Truce.
You're kidding me.
No.
I'm not.
You showed up at the guy's house in the middle of the night, drunk, and you didn't even sleep with him?
Should I have?
It never hurts.
God.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
You left quite a bit of stuff at my place last night.
Purse, and earrings, and a shoe.
I am so sorry for what happened last night.
On my list of embarrassing things that I've done in my life, that was numbers one through seven.
I totally understand if you wanna cancel.
It's okay.
You can make it up to me tonight on our second date.
Second?
Well, yeah.
Last night was our first date.
So, that would make tonight our second.
I'm looking forward to it.
You like dancing?
Yeah!
I don't I'm a I don't like dancing.
Then we don't have to go.
Okay.
Well, we went on our first date, and I didn't even know it.
A.K.A., I nailed it.
No fires, no ambulances, just good old-fashioned showing up drunk at a guy's house late at night.
However, I wanna be clear, I have no plans to resign.
Is it weird that my feelings are hurt that no one's found any dirt on me yet?
Hello!
I drove a riding lawn mower through a Nordstrom!
There's video that I took!
It's on the Internet.
Nothing.
Jerry.
Plastic surgery?
I got hit by a fire engine.
You are so lucky.
How?
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Today we are welcoming a delegation from the Parks Department of our sister city, Boraqua, Venezuela.
Our photo-op with the mayor is tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. So, I'm gonna need your suggestions about my wardrobe ASAP.
I told you, gold sequin sweatpants.
Also, remember, everyone, Venezuela is a poor country.
These men are not used to the wealth and flash that we have here in central Indiana.
Our only job over the next two days is to make these men feel at home.
Yes, I am a little nervous.
Pawnee has kind of a tricky history with welcoming foreign visitors.
But things have changed.
Our guests are gonna stay in a motel, for sure.
Oh, God!
What if they don't speak English?
April, you know Spanish, right?
Oh, good.
Excellent.
My mom's Puerto Rican.
That's why I'm so lively and colorful.
Oh, my God.
Here they are.
Okay, everybody, clean up.
Pull your thing up.
Everyone, just be Good.
Jerry, hit it.
This is my baby.
I've put this whole trip together, and let me tell you something.
It's not been easy, you know?
How do you fit all of Pawnee in a 48-hour visit?
I had to drop the Rock and Roll bowling alley from our itinerary.
That was one of the most difficult phone calls I've ever had to make.
Hello, most excellent representatives of the great Parks Department of Boraqua, Venezuela.
I am Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, and Chairwoman of the Departmental Ad-Hoc Sub-Committee for Pit Beautification, Leslie Knope.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Vice-Director Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departamento de Parques, Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Maldonado.
I'm Tom.
These are my colleagues, Antonio Rivera-Fonseca, Minister of Small Fountains.
And Elvis Correja, Administrator of Hedges.
And he is?
Pay no attention to him.
He is our intern, Jhonny.
He is worthless.
We are quite tired from our trip.
Could you have your servant collect our bags, please?
What'd he call me?
Tom, please.
It's a different culture, okay?
Just be a good host.
Do this for me?
Fine.
Yes.
We will get our pathetic servant boy to fetch your luggage.
Go, boy!
Now, I know you gentlemen had a long flight, but I have prepared a welcome party in your honor.
Excellent.
I like to party.
Well, my job is to see to your every need.
Do we just select the woman we desire?
I will take the large black one.
Interesting choice.
What?
Do you have some kind of book with photos of the women available to us?
If not, I will also take the sexy black one.
I am not surprised at all.
I've been to South America.
I did very well there.
I think there might've been a translation problem.
When I said party, I meant one that did not include sex for pay.
But one that had food and drink and dancing, that sort of thing.
So, no women?
No.
Off to kind of a weird start.
We have so much to learn from each other.
What kind of birds do you guys eat?
Chickens.
Us, too!
Amazing.
What is this?
Water, I'm sorry.
Agua.
In our country, government officials drink only bottled water.
I can assure you that that water's very safe to drink.
No.
Bottled, please.
Send the boy.
Tom, go get water.
Leslie, come on!
For your troubles.
You got it, Chief.
Hey, April, can you help me out a second Go away, Jerry.
Okay.
This is a gold plated replica of the gun Hugo Chavez used in the 1992 Socialist revolution.
It is a gift.
This gun truly symbolizes the blossoming peace between our two nations.
A key aspect to diplomacy is gift-giving.
The gift has to be nice enough to honor and respect the guest, but not so nice that it shames him.
Plus, it needs to represent the local culture.
And I found the perfect thing.
A bottle of high-fructose corn syrup, made right here in Pawnee's own Sweetums factory.
Sweetums!
If you can't beat 'em, Sweetums!
Since 1891.
And eight and a half dozen rubber baby bottle nipples, also made here in Pawnee.
Kernston's Rubber Nipples, tastes like the real thing.
Yes.
And we too are pleased to be here in your dirty alleyway.
We thank you for the container of sap, and the bag of garbage.
His English isn't perfect, so I don't think he realizes how insulting he's being.
We're also sister cities with Kaesong, North Korea.
Their town is far nicer.
That's fine, it's my job.
I'm a diplomat.
I'm not supposed to take it personally.
We haven't been here for a very long time, but what we have seen is, really, from the bottom of our hearts, truly depressing.
Really, really sad stuff.
I mean, that's why people respect Hillary Clinton so much.
'Cause, nobody takes a punch like her.
She's the strongest, smartest punching bag in the world.
It's funny because Antonio said to me, "Can we turn this car around "and say we're sick or something, or that we lost our way"?
Of course, that would be rude to you.
What is your profession?
I'm a city planner.
This city was planned?
On the drive in, I saw a tattoo parlor, next to a school next to a Taco Bell.
It looks like it was designed by a very stupid rodent.
He's actually a pretty smart rodent.
Uh-oh!
Ah!
You have a quick wit.
You know what?
I've changed my mind, I will have you for the evening.
Oh!
Boy.
She'll get back to you on that.
Politically, no, I don't support Chavez.
I despise him and everything that he does.
On the other hand, this is a pretty sweet-ass gun.
The banana you wanted, senor.
Ah!
Finally.
You peel.
What?
With your hands, you peel the banana.
Okay!
Let's get started, shall we?
I have a full day of activities planned.
I would like to see where the children are fed the sweeteners.
A restaurant?
American children are fattened more efficiently than any other children in the world.
I mean, they're like little basketballs.
I mean, they're huge, little porkers.
Okay.
This is our thermometer!
I'm trying to turn a giant dirt pit into a community park.
But I need $35,000, and the city doesn't have enough money in its budget.
I do not understand.
You've never had a budget shortage?
No.
Venezuela is blessed with massive oil reserves.
Massive, I mean, tremendous, like, you would not believe.
Hmm.
The state sells the oil, and keeps all the money, and we build whatever we want.
Wow, well.
Now, I do not understand.
I feel my English was very clear.
Shall I repeat?
Venezuela, Venezuela, my country, has a lot of oil.
Oil is food for cars.
The Venezuelans are a very confident people.
Okay, look, I know these guys didn't turn out to be exactly how we thought they would be.
You said they might not know what toilet paper is.
I'm calling an audible.
We can't be humble anymore.
What we're gonna do is, we're gonna take them to our best park and we're gonna blow their socks off.
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna blow their socks off.
Fine, we'll go further.
We'll take them to Chicago and pretend it's part of Pawnee.
Or New York.
Or London!
No, wait, the money's different there.
They'll figure it out.
Okay, never mind.
We'll go to the park.
Everybody doing okay back there?
Comfortable?
Well, the motel we're putting you up in is really nice.
You can watch TBS.
Do you have TBS in Venezuela?
I have everything in Venezuela.
I have four satellite dishes on my estate.
We get 14,000 channels.
Fourteen thousand.
I already know who wins Project Runway.
Wow.
I'm coming over to your house then.
I see what you're getting at, but no, thank you.
I am still primarily interested in the large black woman.
Here we are!
Take it in, boys.
This is an embarrassment to America.
I'm sorry?
You are right to want to correct this.
Correct what?
This is the giant pit of dirt you were telling us about, is it not?
The one you want to turn into a park?
No, no.
This is already a park.
And it's one of our best-loved parks.
Why are the trees so small?
They're not that small.
Besides, size doesn't matter.
Yes, it does.
Our trees are huge.
We build tunnels through them.
The parks in Boraqua are far superior.
The park in my hometown, El parque del Este, we have a monorail, and we have an aquarium, and we have the Jaripa Amphitheater.
It's huge.
Lady Gaga played there last week.
Great.
Well, we don't have Lady Gaga.
And I don't think she's going to come here unless her career takes a very bad turn.
But we have something more beautiful than Lady Gaga.
Democracy.
I'm gonna show you an example of that.
Let's go to a town hall meeting.
Elvis, Oh Henry!
Raul, Butterfinger.
Antonio, Nestle Crunch with the crispy rice removed.
Weird choice, but for you, I got it done.
I find it incredibly demeaning.
But guess what?
Cash money.
I'm gonna make it rain I'm just gonna pick that up real quick.
So, are you guys ready?
We're about to start.
This is where you have your meetings?
Well, the location rotates.
Sometimes we have them on the volleyball courts.
Where do you hold your meetings?
Well, now that you ask, we usually rotate as well between different fortresses and citadels, and palaces.
Hmm.
We don't need palaces.
The ideas are what shine in our meetings.
What are you?
Some kind of moron?
Why don't you have hand dryers in the park bathrooms?
They're so much more sanitary than paper towels!
Anyone knows that!
My dog went to one of your parks and ate another dog's feces.
And I'm going to sue you for that.
How do you like it?
No!
How do you like that?
Now imagine you're holding coffee.
This is outrageous.
Where are the armed men who come in to take the protesters away?
Where are they?
This kind of behavior is never tolerated in Boraqua.
You shout like that, they put you in jail.
Right away.
No trial, no nothing.
Journalists?
We have a special jail for journalists.
You're stealing?
Right to jail.
You're playing music too loud?
Right to jail.
Right away.
You're driving too fast?
Jail.
Slow?
Jail.
You're charging too high prices for sweaters, glasses, you right to jail.
You undercook fish, believe it or not, jail.
You overcook chicken, also jail.
Undercook, overcook.
You make an appointment with the dentist and you don't show up?
Believe it or not, jail, right away.
We have the best patients in the world, because of jail.
Well, it was tough going, but it was lively.
What did you think of the open forum?
This meeting of ugly people yelling?
It is like torture.
That's one perspective.
In Boraqua, the government moves like a hot knife through butter.
Not as this here, listening to people yelling, these fat faces turning all red?
Are you kidding me?
We're like kings!
We walk down the street and they treat us like rock stars.
We answer to nobody.
In a true Democracy, we believe that the input of our citizens is extremely valuable.
Hey!
These pretzels suck!
Thank you.
See?
No wonder nothing ever gets done in this country.
Really?
Nothing gets done?
Tell that to the Golden Gate Bridge.
Or American Idol.
Or the moon!
Oh, wait, you can't, 'cause you've never been there.
Look, this is not personal.
We just think that you are weak and your city is disgusting.
I think you're rude.
And I think you've been rude since you came here.
And I think that your medals are stupid and your uniform is lame, and you guys want to marry Hugo Chavez!
Hey!
Do not disrespect Chavez.
Stupid Chavez.
I just told you not to disrespect him.
Good, I just did.
That's twice.
I don't like Chavez.
Yes, you do.
And do not disrespect him.
No, I don't!
Yes, you do!
No, I don't, Raul.
Look, if you don't like it here, then go, okay, Raul?
Great.
Good.
Shut up.
We're shutting up, yeah.
And we'll go.
Those are our pens.
Right.
We don't even need them.
Great, then don't take them.
We didn't.
They started it.
Look, those guys were rude, arrogant, narrow-minded, class-A jerks.
Now, I may have lost my cool, but they deserved it.
Okay.
I'll call the mayor and cancel the photo-op.
No!
Don't do that!
Okay.
Then call the Venezuelans and apologize.
No, they were rude, arrogant, narrow-minded, class-A jerks!
Okay.
Then I'll call the mayor and cancel the photo-op.
No!
Do you see the problem here?
Yes!
But I don't want to!
Yesterday I was tough and direct and today I have to be charming.
Basically Thank you!
Yesterday I was Hillary Clinton, and today I'm Bill.
Can I get anyone anything to drink before we start?
Coffee?
Brandy?
I'd love some coffee.
Anything, guys?
No.
Some nuts?
I'll have some nuts.
Gummi Bears?
Sure.
Apple crisps?
Yeah.
Granola bars?
I'll take those.
Nothing?
Sure?
Okay.
I'll be right out there if you need me.
Well, Raul, gentlemen, thank you for coming.
Well, I would just like to first say, I am so sorry for blowing up yesterday.
It was completely uncalled for.
Well, we are sorry as well.
We were very tired from our long journey.
Also, we were a bit jealous.
Our colleagues from Caracas are visiting their sister city of Miami.
Yeah.
They've been partying with Dwyane Wade.
They sent us all these photos and QuickTime files.
I mean, you have to see this place Miami.
Just gorgeous, everything.
There's so much soul and life everywhere!
Every little tiny street, so much culture, and history!
And the cars!
People really take care of their cars there.
You notice that and they're a little older, Clean and shiny but still just beautiful.
Really, really nice.
Yeah.
And the food, so spicy and wonderful.
We could not even believe it.
But Pawnee is really good as well.
Yes.
In any case, I made a few phone calls, and the government of Venezuela has authorized a special gift for you.
$35,000?
Yes, it is to fill your pit to start to build a park.
No, no, we can't take this.
Yes, yes, yes.
Please.
We will see you later today at the photo-opportunity.
And I think we're good here.
No?
Okay.
Okay, gracias.
Good meeting.
I don't know.
Maybe I should return the money.
It's from a foreign government, I don't really trust these guys.
I'm gonna return the money.
Are you crazy?
You could buy a low-end Lexus with that money.
Or, you could build a park with that money.
Let's look at the pros and cons.
Pro, we could fill in the pit and build a park.
Con, we might be filling it in with dirty money.
Pro, $35,000 worth of dirty money.
Con, not quite sure why that's a pro.
Pro, we can fill in the pit.
Con, Ann already said that.
Pro and con never works!
Pro, yes it does.
Fine.
Fine.
We'll keep the money.
Okay?
Everybody happy?
Jerry, are you happy?
What did I do?
Meeting adjourned, Jerry!
Can I just say, I still feel kind of weird about this money.
Okay.
Look, I know they've given you a hard time.
When the mayor gets here, we'll do the photo-op, they'll be out of our hair, you'll get to build your park.
Ah!
Leslie!
Hello.
Raul.
The mayor will be with us in just a few minutes.
If you don't mind, we would like to take a video of you to show our superiors.
Okay, sure.
Do you have the check that we gave to you?
Ah, yes, I do.
Okay, you're gonna show it to the camera and say how much it is and what it is for.
Okay, this is a check for $35,000 and it is to build a park.
How generous!
Yes, it's really generous.
Now say "Viva Venezuela"!
Viva Venezuela!
Viva Chavez!
Thank you, Venezuela!
"Viva Chavez"!
Say it!
Aw, come on.
I don't want to "viva" that guy.
We just gave you $35,000.
That's worth one "viva".
Viva Chavez.
Yes!
Viva Chavez!
Yeah.
What is he saying?
They are very happy.
They say Hugo Chavez will love this video because it is another success for their committee.
Committee?
Yeah.
They're a Committee to Humiliate and Shame America.
It will be a good video.
The Committee to Humiliate and Shame America?
Yes.
It is Hugo Chavez's passion project.
And we just had an idea.
Why don't you call the park after Chavez?
You know, you call it Hugo Chavez Park.
And you can have a nice, big fountain of his head, so that when the water is coming out he is spitting at you all the time.
You should write this down.
Viva America!
Viva Pawnee!
Viva Mayor Walter Gunderson!
You have offended us.
You have offended the government of Boraqua.
You are no longer our sister.
No, America is not perfect.
But diplomacy isn't just sucking up and being a pushover.
Sometimes you got to get tough.
I am gonna build that park myself, and it is gonna be awesome.
And it's not gonna have a fountain shaped like Hugo Chavez's head spitting water all over everyone.
Unless that's what the people want.
And that, sir, is democracy.
Leslie, come see this!
Check out this video April sent me.
Hey, guys.
I'm at Jhonny's place in Venezuela.
It's okay, I guess.
He has like five million rooms.
And this is only his guesthouse.
Holy cow!
There's a lot of guys with guns here.
It's better than my mom's house, I guess.
So, tell Leslie I don't know when I'm gonna be back.
Oh, and Donna's here.
Hey, guys!
Ola!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
We noticed abnormal activity on your credit card, so we just need you to confirm or deny some of the recent charges.
Okay.
Thank you.
$20 to Netflix?
Yeah.
$20 to Blockbuster Online?
Both?
I needed all eleven disks of Gossip Girl at the same time.
$120 in tuition to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry?
They give you a little wand, and a diploma.
It's fun.
What did you major in?
Potions.
You know, I'm gonna take you off speakerphone.
Go ahead.
Jessica Simpson clip-in hair extensions?
No.
Okay Um, I wore those once.
It was a money-back guarantee, but I forgot to return them.
Man Pillow, the pillow shaped like a man?
Oh, God.
Also something called "Bucket of Cake".
Yeah, you know what?
I think someone definitely stole my credit card.
So why don't you just cancel it?
Do you wanna hear what else they purchased?
Yes.
No, you don't have to refund anything.
Just cancel the credit card and we'll all go on with our lives.
Thank you.
So, what does a Man Pillow look like?
Daniel Craig.
It's for my lower back.
My name is Keef, and I am your friend.
Are you guys my friends?
Yeah.
All right!
Awesome!
It is playground time!
Well, we're here in Eagleton.
It's two towns over.
And we're all volunteering for Kaboom, a service organization that says it builds a playground in a day.
High five!
High five!
High five!
I never trust anything that comes that quickly.
That's why I don't eat Minute Rice.
So this whole "build a playground in a day" thing, I mean, that's just a slogan, right?
Nope.
One day, 24 hours.
Keef, that is so incredible.
I mean, I work in Parks, and I know how hard it is to get something done.
Not if you have the Kaboom spirit.
You can look at a problem, and you can either go, "Oh, this is a problem" or you can kaboom, blow it up and turn it into something great.
You literally kaboom the problem.
Come on, people!
I see more ground than playground!
Kaboom.
Don't do that.
One, two, three.
Man, this is tough.
Yeah, but just think of all the kids that'll swing on this swing, fat kids, skinny kids, brainiacs, sluts, the gay drama kids, goths, jocks, the alternative crowd.
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, Leslie.
Hi.
Whoa.
Ann.
What are you doing here?
Oh!
I'm volunteering.
I love to volunteer.
The key to volunteering?
A lot of pockets.
For putting all the food in.
The Red Cross has amazing cookies.
I go there all the time.
Meals On Wheels was a bonanza.
Suicide Hotline, surprisingly lame spread.
I thought I'd give back to those less fortunate than myself.
You live in a pit.
Not anymore.
Living with the drummer of my band.
Living indoors, pretty cool, not to brag.
Kind of hard not to.
Anyhow, got to go, me and an old Asian lady are double-teaming some monkey bars.
So Hey, look.
I got a remote control and I'm controlling you.
Go faster.
Go faster.
Go faster, Ron's the master.
Well.
You have been officially kaboomed.
Whoa.
Look at you two and your big kabooms.
Great job.
I got gifts.
Oh!
There you go, for you.
And one more for you.
Thank you.
So, you guys gonna join us tomorrow in Muncie?
No, I wish, but back to the real world.
At least you guys will be kabooming somewhere, right?
Remember, you take a man kabooming, he kabooms for a day.
But you teach a man how to kaboom.
Kaboom, kaboom, kaboom.
Oh, I'm so pumped.
Feel I could take on the world.
I could prep, like, a thousand diagnostic tests.
In an hour.
That's the spirit.
There it is, the pit.
Hmm.
There's something I wish I could kaboom.
Well, we are.
It's just a slow-boom.
A slower, more deliberate kaboom.
Yeah.
Totally.
See you tomorrow.
Okay.
You know what this mess is?
This is a list of things we have to complete before we fill in the pit behind Ann's house.
You know what this is?
This is a kaboomer.
Jerry, did you use permanent marker again?
I'm sorry, guys, I I just grabbed the wrong This is a big I grabbed the wrong This isn't gonna Open very big, Jerry.
Okay.
Forget it.
Let's all pretend Jerry wasn't born.
And this is clean.
How do we speed up the process?
How do we kaboom it?
Rules, codes, permits, red tape.
I never realized how frustrating it is to be in the government.
In my next life, I'm going into private industry.
Maybe strip mining.
Okay, everybody take out their thinking caps and rip them up.
Then take out your doing caps, 'cause we're gonna do something today.
I have a couple of doing caps in my wallet.
That's what I call condoms.
Come on, Tom.
Focus, please.
How do we cut through the red tape and how do we get this pit filled in?
Ideas?
We need to cut through the red tape and get the pit filled in.
Yes, Tom.
Good.
Okay, everybody else needs to participate.
Come on, guys.
These suggestions aren't gonna suggest themselves.
Yes, Jerry.
This idea better be good.
Ann?
I support you.
Good.
You could petition to expedite the Architecture Review Board process.
Mark, buddy, you're not listening to me.
I want to kaboom it.
Okay?
Can I talk to you outside really quick?
Sure.
Mark's gonna help me, so thanks for nothing, Jerry.
Good job, Ann.
So you really wanna get this pit filled in?
Yes.
And you'll do whatever it takes?
Mark, I am so sick of moving like a slug.
I want to move like a cheetah.
Or a slug driving a remote controlled car.
Something more plausible than that, but fast.
Would you break the rules?
I won't murder.
That's good to know.
But it's actually very simple.
If you wanna fill in the pit, just go fill it in.
Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness.
Oh, I like that.
Okay, wow.
So who gives me the go-ahead to not ask for permission but ask for forgiveness?
Is it Ron?
No, no.
No.
It's nobody.
It's nobody, it's you.
You have to be bold.
Okay.
Okay, look.
You wanna get the pit filled in?
Go rent a bulldozer and fill in the freaking pit.
Hey.
What's up?
Say you had a friend who wanted to do something good, but a little risky, and she was kind of nervous about it, and this friend is me.
What should I do?
Mmm.
You should do it, and you should ask your friend to help you, because your friend totally has your back.
And that friend is me.
You'll help me?
Of course, I'll do anything I can to help.
Let's do it.
Okay.
What are we doing?
Is it dangerous?
We're not gonna murder anyone.
It was crazy.
I didn't get a single permit.
Nobody stamped anything.
All I did was order a backhoe, and it came with a guy who runs it.
I've never rented a guy before.
I wish I knew about that during prom.
There was a girl at my prom who was known as "the back ho".
Mary Dunbar.
She'd let anyone massage her back.
I'm so excited we're doing this.
And we're doing it without permission.
We're giving ourselves permission.
Look, I had these hard hats made.
Check it out.
Kick, Ass.
I'll take that one.
Okay.
Oh, my God, Ann, this is so cool.
Do you feel giddy?
Yeah.
I'm so proud of us.
Miss Montague, you ready?
I didn't wanna tell him my real name, you know?
Yeah.
First, speech.
Is important moment here.
We are about to fill this hole now, not with dirt, but with the courage of a thousand lions and the solemn memory of all of our friends who have fallen in this cursed hole.
Dump it!
Ugh!
What the.
Andy?
I'm okay.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Oh!
Well, that beeping was sure annoying.
But this is even more annoying.
I'll handle this.
The monitor is not a toy, Andy.
Anything is a toy if you play with it.
I'll chalk that up to your concussion.
The good news is your CAT scan's clear.
Cool.
Andy, I'm really happy you're okay.
Leslie was worried, too.
We should've checked before to see if you were home.
Oh, no, I told you.
I moved out of the pit.
I just had to go back because I forgot my headphones.
Then I laid down on this really comfy tarp, I saw an old cereal box I hadn't read before, so I must have drifted off.
Next thing you know Dirt.
Scooch up for one sec.
And back down.
There you go.
Ah!
That is perfect.
It's like I'm lying in a cloud.
This is awesome.
Ann and Andy, just like old times.
The pit works in mysterious ways.
I'm sorry about Andy, but I'm not sorry about what I did.
What's my crime?
I got bold?
And a little negligent?
Knope!
My office!
Now!
Hey.
Can I smoke in here?
You don't smoke.
Just asking if I can.
Are you high?
I'm high on kaboom.
Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness.
That's right.
You never did ask me for permission, did you?
Well, I'm sorry to burst your k-bubble, but I just had my ass k-handed to me by the City Manager.
And now this entire department is k-screwed.
Ron, I'm so, so, so sorry.
What the K- were you thinking?
I would prefer that she ask me for my permission so I can say no.
I like saying no.
It lowers their enthusiasm.
Hello.
So, I brought you some clean clothes that I found at my house.
Oh, my God.
My sexy sweater.
It has a hole cut out over the bicep.
Thank you.
No problem.
No, A-Cakes, seriously, thank you.
You're welcome.
No.
Thank you.
No, no, no, no, no.
What What are you What do you think is happening right now?
A tragic accident reignited feelings you thought were long dead, and we are finally back together.
Andy, we're not back together.
You know that I'm kind of with Mark now.
Oh, God.
Is that still happening?
I don't get it.
What does he have that I don't have?
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Everything.
He has, literally, everything you don't have.
A job, a car, a steady income, an address, a second pair of shoes, table manners, the ability to say "tampon" without giggling.
Mark has his life together.
I'll get you a different nurse.
It's awful what happened to Andy.
But sometimes when you make an omelet, you got to break a few eggs.
What's the alternative?
No omelets at all?
Who wants to live in that kind of world?
Maybe birds.
Then all their babies would live.
Miss Knope?
Miss Knope.
Hi.
Scott Braddock, City Attorney.
Hey, Scott.
I didn't know that you were friends with Andy.
I never met him.
What I do know is that he could sue us at the drop of a hat.
I mean, right now, he's the most dangerous man in Pawnee.
Is that all you lawyers think about?
Lawsuits, and laws and legalese?
Yes.
Yeah.
Well, you can relax.
All I'm gonna do is go in and just say, "We are so sorry, it's entirely our fault" No, no, no, no.
You can't say any of that.
It admits liability.
You can't say "I'm sorry," or "I apologize".
It implies guilt.
That's insane.
I have to apologize.
Andy was a victim Can't say "victim".
of an extremely unfortunate situation.
Can't say "unfortunate," and you can't say "situation".
I can't say the word "situation"?
No.
It implies there was a situation.
Can I give him the pig?
Yeah, the pig's fine.
Hi, Andy.
Hi, Leslie.
I got this for you.
Hope you squeal better.
Aw!
This is my friend Scott.
Hi, Scott.
Mmm-hmm.
Andy, I just wanted to say, I am so, so Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm, mmm.
Filled with emotions, as any person would.
What?
No miming.
Uh You were in the pit.
We're not conceding that point.
You were in a place.
We're both here now.
The government No, no.
No.
We got to go.
What?
Let's go.
Why?
Wendell Adams.
I'm Andrew's attorney.
Andy, no.
It's my only option.
Andy, stop.
I've advised my client not to speak with you.
He's suing the City of Pawnee.
Andy, you're suing your hometown?
Andy, no.
Look, can we just talk about this?
Leslie, no.
This is terrible.
Don't say "terrible".
Don't look back.
Hello?
Andy, it's Leslie.
Hello?
Hello?
Andy, it's Leslie.
Psych.
Leave a message after the beep.
Andy, it's Leslie.
Look.
What did you mean when you said it's your only option?
I think we should talk.
Without lawyers present.
If you wanna meet, just put a white chalk "X" on the mailbox across the street from City Hall.
Or call me back.
Just call me back.
Andy, why aren't you returning my calls?
Is it because of your lawyer?
It's because of your lawyer.
Hey, Andy, it's your aunt, your mom or dad's sister.
I don't know how to tell you this but your uncle has passed.
He's with Jesus now.
So we're having a memorial in 30 minutes at City Hall.
Hey!
Free guitars at City Hall!
Everybody run!
Because of a local disaster, you, Andy Dwyer, must go to the evacuation center at Pawnee City Hall.
Hmm.
That was weird.
How long have you been there?
I promise that Andy isn't suing just for the money.
Leslie, the man lived in a pit.
Okay?
He couldn't find a place to live on the Earth's surface, so he went under the ground.
You're dealing with a grown man who thinks like a gopher.
I feel like if I could get past the lawyers and find out what's really going on, I think I could get him to drop the lawsuit.
Ann, is that you?
Hey.
We need to talk somewhere private.
Oh!
Baby, I'm back.
Thank you so Why are you naked?
Oh!
Well, because of what you said.
We're getting back together.
No, we're not.
Yes, we are.
You should've heard the super sexy stuff she was saying to me.
I said, "Hey, Andy.
It's Ann.
Can we talk at my house"?
That's not how you said it.
You were like, "Hey, Andy.
It's Ann.
Can you talk at my house"?
Oh, my God, you are such a baby.
Ugh!
Literally.
Big, naked baby.
Put clothes on.
You know what?
I should have seen this coming.
Has he showed up naked before?
Oh, yeah.
Anniversaries, birthdays, holidays.
Good luck.
Where are you Hey, Ann.
Just None of your clothes fit me.
So I'm putting an apron over the front stuff.
Is she gone?
What did you mean when you said this was your only option?
Well, I'm completely broke, and my lawyer said it could be worth upwards of $100,000.
I just can't believe that you're suing just for the money.
I want Ann back, and she said she really needs a guy with a lot of money.
That doesn't sound like Ann.
Well, I can't really do her voice, but she said she likes Mark because he's a grown-up with a bank account.
I put two and two together.
$100,000, I could probably get a bank account.
Sometimes, I think the right thing to do is to not take shortcuts.
I mean, look, I tried to fill in the pit, that didn't work either.
Fine.
I'll get a job.
Ann will respect that.
I can make six bucks a day playing guitar on the street.
I can't make six bucks a day.
Wait a second.
I know I just said that maybe shortcuts are bad, but I kind of just thought of an awesome shortcut.
Mr. Dwyer, we're very happy that you're dropping the suit.
Yeah, it's really terrific.
I have my conditions.
No.
Never.
I will not negotiate with greedy street people.
Wait, Leslie.
Let's hear him out.
We planned this.
Kaboom.
All right.
What's it gonna take?
One, I want that pit filled in, sir.
Is there a two?
A guaranteed starting spot in the Indianapolis Colts, inside linebacker.
Well, we can't accomplish that.
I think that Andy seems like he doesn't care so much about the second one, and he would be fine with us just filling in the pit.
What do you say, Scott?
Yeah.
I mean, eventually, we're gonna fill in the pit.
"Eventually"?
I've already been injured in that thing twice.
And I could fall in 10 more times by "eventually".
Every time I walk past that pit, I'm forced to relive the most traumatic two separate days of my life, and wanna sue you again.
Well, I hate to say it, but it really seems like Andy has us over a barrel here, Scott.
Yeah.
This is really happening.
I just can't believe it.
Oh, sorry.
Usually, in these situations, a person says "pinch me".
Is that Andy?
Ah, yeah.
Just one of his conditions for the settlement, I guess.
He settled?
Yup.
Gave up $100,000 probably just for one thing, the city fill in the pit behind your house.
Why?
Who knows?
Who knows why that gopher does what he does?
You always hated this pit!
Goodbye, pit.
Hello, lot.
How does taking risks make me feel?
Amazing.
Tingling sensation throughout my whole body.
I feel flushed.
My muscles are relaxed, yet I feel awake.
Just waves of pleasure.
I wish there was something physical that could make me feel this way.
Wow, you did it.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
There's so much more to do.
Oh, my God, we're so close.
Yeah.
I'm gonna call Kaboom, and check on their availability for next year.
Great.
Information.
Hi, yes, I'd like the number for Kaboom, the national playground building charity.
I hope they can work us in.
Sorry, there's no listing for that name.
What?
Are you sure?
"Kaboom" is a word I made up.
It's not in any dictionary.
I trick people into building playgrounds on empty lots in their neighborhoods.
It's an elaborate prank.
For my next prank, I'm going to build a hospital in a poor part of China.
They'll never see it coming.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Greg Pikitis.
You're the Parks lady, right?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm the Parks lady.
Leslie Knope.
And I'm here to tell you that this year it ends.
Ugh, this kid makes me crazy.
We got a history, Greg and I. He absolutely terrorizes the Parks system.
Every Halloween someone defaces the statue of Mayor Percy in Ramsett Park.
And I know it's Greg Pikitis, but I've never been able to prove it.
He's like an invisible, adolescent, James Bond super villain criminal mastermind.
Or maybe someone else is doing it, but I really feel like it's this kid.
I've got the entire Parks Department watching you, my boyfriend's a cop, so don't even try it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, I think you do.
It ends today, Pikitis.
It ends.
Today.
Thanks for stopping by, Leslie.
You look great.
Thank you.
Ends today.
Hey, Parks Department.
Yeah, Ann's here.
Uh, just to remind you, tonight, Everybody in?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cool.
Okay.
Halloween is my favorite holiday, it's just the best.
And I don't have to work.
Hey, slutty teenage girls dressed as sexy kittens, pump your own stomachs this year.
Oh, one more thing, the people in this room now are the people I invited, plus Leslie and Donna, so, don't tell anybody.
Who's not invited, then?
Hey!
What's going on, cupcake?
Excited about the party tonight.
Oh!
Oh, you're coming?
I was just about to tell you.
Jerry already told me.
Can't wait to see how tiny your costume is.
What time does it start?
Perfect.
Yeah, it's perfect.
Check this out.
These are all the possible routes from Greg Pikitis' house to the statue.
That looks like something you would find on the wall of a serial killer.
In a way, that's a compliment.
Shows dedication.
Mmm.
What's the big deal, anyway?
I mean, a kid TPs some statue.
And all the trees and all the benches.
It takes us, like, 10 days to clean his mess up.
But more importantly, Greg Pikitis sucks, and I wanna destroy him.
Okay.
Well, if you destroy him early, please come by.
I will.
Hey!
How is someone gonna be able to get through that door?
Oh.
Oh!
What the Are you kidding me?
Jerry!
Relax.
Here.
Uh, William Percy.
One of Pawnee's greatest mayors.
And a true hero.
During the Pawnee Bread Factory fire of 1922, he ran back into a burning building and saved the beloved secret recipe for Pawnee Pumpernickel.
Didn't, like, 30 people die in that fire?
He wasn't Superman.
He looks like Ron Swanson.
Is that who this is based on?
No.
It's based on William Percy.
Were you listening to what I just said?
Yes.
Okay, Andy.
Good news.
You're officially on the Parks Department payroll.
$8 an hour.
Commit this to memory.
You see him, you stop him.
Knock his head off if you have to.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
But I give you permission to use excessive force.
Don't use excessive force.
Don't go overboard.
Just stop him.
By any means necessary.
No.
No.
Just stop him.
You know what I mean?
A week ago I had nothing.
Now, I have a part-time job.
I'm gonna make $32 tonight.
I owe Leslie everything I have.
Which, after tonight, will be $39.
Hello, Ann.
Hey!
Am I early?
Nope, you are right on time.
I like your costume.
Oh, thanks.
Raggedy Ann.
It was one of my favorite books when I was a kid.
Hmm.
I'm a pirate.
Right.
Oh.
Hey, Dr. Harris.
How are you?
Ann.
Thanks.
Um, this is Ron Swanson, from the Parks Department.
I know him from that thing that I'm doing.
This is Dr. Harris.
You're a doctor.
Yup.
I meant your costume.
I got it.
Worlds colliding, always awkward.
with friends in parking lot.
He looks obnoxious and irritating, even from a great distance.
Uh, confirmed.
Normally, I hate working on Halloween, but it's nice hanging out with Leslie.
You know, she's focused, she's committed And she made out with me in my cop car, which is pretty neat.
I shouldn't have said that.
That's clear to me now.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Remember my boyfriend Derek, and his boyfriend Ben?
Yeah, hi.
It's totally okay that you didn't wear a costume.
I did.
I'm a straight person.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
See?
Sorry it's a little bit lame right now.
But we'll get it going.
I passed up a gay Halloween party to be here.
Do you know how much fun gay Halloween parties are?
Last year, I saw three Jonas Brothers make out with three Robert Pattinsons.
It was amazing.
So, you're the Mark that Ann is dating.
I suppose that I am.
We're very protective of Ann.
We look out for her.
So, you kind of dropped the ball with Andy then, didn't you?
Aw!
Andy.
I loved Andy.
Ah, such a sweetheart.
Is Andy coming tonight?
You should get back with Andy.
Who needs a drink?
I do.
Suspect laughing with friends and playing with his stupid skateboard in a snide, turdish manner.
Turdish?
Yes.
Like a turd.
Like a little turd.
Hey, listen, your scare tactics clearly worked.
You got Andy guarding the statue.
Why don't we go to Ann's party?
Lt'll be fun.
Oh.
Uh We wanted to cover that block anyway.
Wanted a police presence on it, so, this is within the Confines of Sure, let's go.
Yeah?
Okay.
Yeah.
We'll go by my office and pick up my costume.
Got it.
Can't we just fire a warning shot over his head as we drive by?
No, babe.
Don't touch that.
Leaving location.
Look at stupid suspect.
I hate suspect.
Where are my keys?
Looks like it's open.
Really?
Yeah.
Pikitis!
We've been tailing that kid for a couple of hours.
I mean, it must have been somebody else.
It was Pikitis.
Believe me now?
That doesn't mean anything to me.
This is a peach pit.
Okay.
He was eating a peach when I went to go talk to him.
Mmm-hmm?
This is his ace of spades.
This is his calling card.
This is what he leaves all his victims.
And it's still warm.
Okay, go and arrest him.
And send this to the lab.
We don't have a lab.
Hi, April.
Okay, you're underage.
You're not.
Hey.
Yeah, I'm gonna leave.
Oh.
Okay.
This isn't that fun.
Didn't need to tell me that.
I'm gonna take this home.
Nobody was drinking it, so I'm gonna take it.
Okay.
Gonna take this, too.
Been meaning to read it.
Okay, this isn't strictly legal.
We can talk to him for maybe an hour, and then I gotta let him go.
You talk to him first.
You have a scary face.
Hey.
No, in a good way.
Scary cute.
Yeah?
Go talk to him.
Okay.
I didn't do this, man.
I promise.
Now, son, I'm a police officer.
Okay?
You shouldn't lie to me.
I'm not.
I've never been here before.
And why would I do this?
Because you've had run-ins with Miss Knope in the past.
Just a second.
Yeah?
Ask him about the peach pit.
This isn't one-way glass, you know.
I can see you.
You know, I like Knope.
I screw with her 'cause she gets all riled up, and her face gets all scrunched up like this.
But I like her.
She's all right.
You see?
What?
I spent the whole day decorating this place, and everybody's in the kitchen.
Why is everyone always in the kitchen?
I think it's going fine.
It's so quiet.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
This is a total failure.
This party is a failure.
Oh, my God.
No, no.
It's not a failure, Ann.
Come on.
Ann, do you have any Mounds?
Because all I can find are Almond Joys.
And almonds give me the squirts.
Hey, I'm here.
Statue's fine.
"Crappy Hallowieners.
" That's hilarious.
Where's the kid?
In the conference room.
Trying to hide his obvious guilt.
Leslie, I don't know what to tell you.
I don't think he did it.
Yeah, he did.
And we need a confession.
Okay.
Andy and I are going to take a walk.
And it's gonna be just you, Pikitis, and these pliers.
Look, I'm not gonna torture this kid.
Nobody said torture.
Why don't you let me take a run at him, boss?
In order to think like one of these guys, you have to think like them.
Yeah.
He's never seen you before.
So imply that you're someone very important and that you can make his life hell.
Greg Pikitis?
Would you like some boiling hot coffee in your face?
My name is Bert Macklin.
I'm with the FBI.
Ooh.
Are these the same kind of chips?
Ann!
What's up, gorgeous!
Perfect.
Get your Raggedy ass over here, girl.
Hey, Tom.
Mad Hatter?
T- Pain, baby!
She poppin', she rollin', she rollin' She climbin' that pole and I'm in love with a stripper This is not a stripper.
It's my wife, Wendy.
You remember her?
Hi.
Thank you so much for inviting us.
Yes, hi.
Sure.
She's a surgeon at County General, and she's super hot.
Well, thank you for being a doctor and not coming dressed as a doctor.
Oh, my God.
Who'd be boring enough to do that?
Ann, what happened here?
Did you tell everyone they're gonna have to get a bone marrow transplant tomorrow?
They look miserable.
This party's a disaster.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
Don't worry about it.
We can fix this.
Totally.
Give us a second.
Looks like Andy's wearing him down.
Shut up!
I'm gonna go finish him off.
That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Why don't you just shut up for a second?
What's going on in here?
He's a jerk.
He's being such a jerk.
That's an awful thing to say to a human being!
Are you crying?
No, I am not crying, okay?
I'm allergic to jerks!
Okay.
Andy, out.
Fine, and I don't even care!
It's stupid Okay.
The gloves are coming off.
What's that?
I think you know what that is.
When I came to visit you at the school, you were eating a peach.
Then my office gets vandalized, and somebody leaves a peach pit on my desk?
I don't think that's a coincidence, Greg.
Wow, you nailed me.
I mean, there's no way that two different people could have eaten the same fruit in the same day, in the same area of Indiana.
Never mind that I was actually eating a plum when you saw me earlier.
I know you did this.
I don't care what you say.
I don't care that you were in the parking lot all night.
Somehow you found a way to get in here Wait, wait, wait.
How did you know that I was in the parking lot all night?
Because I followed you, genius!
If you followed me all night then you know that it wasn't me.
Knope, what is your problem?
Look, I have been very civil.
But I will waterboard you.
No, no.
I don't think she would make a good cop.
I would be frightened to live in a town that she's the cop of, frankly.
What are you doing?
Ann, do you want me to liven things up or not?
Course I do.
All right, then relax.
And turn off all the lights that don't have colored bulbs.
All right, y'all!
Take the pigs in the blanket and put them to sleep!
It's time to get wild!
Get this furniture out of here, y'all, we're making a dance floor.
Come on, y'all.
Put the turkey wraps down.
We're about to get wild.
Ron Swanson's in the building, y'all!
His mom's gonna be here soon.
Please, Dave, just arrest him.
On what charge?
Just handcuff him to something.
Greggy?
Greg!
Gregsy!
Mom!
Mrs. Pikitis?
Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, this is Officer Sanderson.
Bert Macklin, FBI.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
You can't just hold a 16-year-old kid against his will.
Well, we were trying to question him about this vandalism.
Do you have any evidence?
Yes.
No.
No.
We don't.
Two words, peach pit.
Peach pit?
His DNA is all over it, I assume.
We don't know that.
We can get it tested.
We can't.
And if it matches your DNA, then you're going away for a long time.
It won't.
Is this a joke?
No.
I'm calling your shift commander.
Monday morning, I am calling your boss.
I don't know who to call about you The President of the United States of America.
Fine.
And if any of you ever come near my son again, I swear to God I will sue you and everyone in this building.
Come on, honey.
Let them think they've lost us.
Then we're Where are you going?
I gotta go tell my boss why I illegally detained a teenager.
I shouldn't have gotten involved with this.
It's just It's just bad police work.
Yeah, it was bad FBI work, too.
My bad.
Tonight, the "T" in T-Pain stands for Tom Haverford!
Nurses versus doctors.
On my mark, three, two, one.
Go!
Vodka!
Go!
Son.
That is one hell of a costume.
Thanks.
Damn, that's good.
Nice party.
Thanks.
Why would anyone do this?
Kids are kids.
Everybody does stupid stuff like this in high school.
I didn't.
Yeah, but you were probably a nerd, though, huh?
Hey.
Leslie, I mean that in a good way.
Look at you now.
You're the coolest person I've ever met.
I even met John Cougar Mellencamp once.
Andy, why don't you go home?
I'll finish cleaning this up.
No way.
I mean, you got me a job and you're helping me turn my life around.
I go home when you go home.
Uh, it's city planning.
It's mostly like regulating things and just making sure people obey the city code.
You wanna get out of here?
Go back to my place?
What?
No.
I'm dating Ann.
Good.
That was a test.
You passed.
Let's celebrate you passing the test, over a drink, at my place.
No.
Still no.
You passed the second test.
But we're still watching you.
So, you wanna get out of here, go back to my place?
Hey.
Ron.
Hello, Wendy.
Well, you and Tom really turned the party around.
We have a good time together.
Tom told me that you know about our green card marriage.
And I just want to say thank you for not telling anyone.
No worries.
I'd hate for you to have to go back to Canada.
All that socialized medicine up there.
Wendylicious.
Where have you been?
I was just thanking Ron.
For, you know, not telling anyone.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.
That was cool of you.
You know, you won't have to keep it a secret much longer, because in a few months we can split up without raising any eyebrows.
And we'll invite you to the divorce party.
Huh, maybe Greg is innocent.
If that's the case, then there's another kid out there who's tormenting me.
Maybe.
I believe that you're innocent until proven guilty in this country.
That's the cornerstone of democracy.
Sure.
On the other hand, Greg Pikitis is a little punk.
And I kind of wanna TP his house.
Let's do it.
Wait, wait!
Wait, wait!
This is fun!
This is fun!
What do I do?
You just grab the toilet paper, unroll it a little bit like this, and throw it on the tree.
This is for Mayor Percy!
This is for the Parks Department office!
This is for pooping on the handball court!
Yeah!
This is really fun!
But I don't condone it!
Bye, guys.
Bye.
You're the man, Swanson.
Thanks for coming.
Ann!
Dude.
Thank you so much.
I don't even know what to say.
Don't mention it.
Also, Tom, your wife is super cool.
So, well done.
Yeah, she's pretty great, right?
Yeah.
I don't know how you landed that chick, but she's awesome.
Nice work.
You're lucky.
Hi, you ready to go?
Yes.
All right.
Thank you so much.
We had so much fun.
Bye, thank you.
About to head home and have crazy sex.
That's cool.
I don't Yeah!
Five-O!
Five-O!
I see you in there, Andy.
Leslie?
What are you doing?
Oh, boy.
That's them, Officer!
Right there!
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry, I think we have the wrong house.
Why are you doing this?
It's really hard to explain, but we were trying to get revenge on this kid, Greg Pikitis, and we thought this was his house, but I guess we got the address wrong.
I'm Greg's mom.
You are?
Yes.
Oh.
Did he hire a fake mom again, to get him out of trouble?
What?
Whenever he gets in trouble, he goes on Craigslist and hires a woman to play his mother and bail him out.
Oh, that little SOB!
Greg!
Gregory!
I knew it!
Oh, my God.
Dude.
That kid is amazing.
He's not in his room.
I don't know where he is.
I do.
Make sure you I need more, man.
Hey!
Yeah!
Let them go!
Yeah!
Stay on the leader!
Cut it!
I am gonna wring your neck!
How did you get into the Parks Department?
I have to know.
Maybe the FBI can figure it out.
I'm not even in the FBI, stupid.
Wow, you're amazing.
Hey!
You're going to jail for a very long time.
You can't He's not gonna go to jail, you know.
He's a minor.
Well, we'll let the jury decide.
There's not gonna be a jury Then the judge will decide where he goes.
Look.
He's going to do probation, he's a minor.
Dave, just let me have this.
Wow.
Nice work, Knope.
Yeah.
That is amazing.
Thanks.
But the thing that's driving me nuts is, how did he do it?
If you destroy him early, please come by.
I will.
How is someone gonna be able to get through that door?
Oh!
What the Are you I mean, we were here all afternoon.
How did he get in?
First of all, we always lock the doors when we leave.
And Dave and I tailed Pikitis from the moment he left his house at 7:00 p.m. to the moment we came back here.
Does he have a lookalike or something?
Did he have an accomplice?
I mean, did he have help?
How did that little turd do it?
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
"Thank you, Old Gus, for brightening our lives, "our hearts, and most importantly, our shoes".
This truly is a day of mixed emotions for me.
I'm sad that Old Gus is leaving, but it allows me to help Andy restart his life as Pioneer Hall's new shoeshine guy.
Well, I've been listening to your boring speeches for the last 50 years, and now it's time for you to listen to one of mine.
You know, a day like this makes a man reflect upon his life, and I've come to the conclusion that I've completely wasted mine.
And just for the record, I never ever liked being called "Old Gus".
I didn't understand it when I was in my 20s, and I sure hate it now.
So go to hell, every single one of you.
Screw Pawnee, and screw your damn shoes.
Oh, God.
That's classic.
So, I propose that we change our name from the Sub-committee for Pit Beautification to the Sub-committee for Lot Beautification.
April, stop that.
Who are you texting?
You.
Aw.
She's texting me.
I'm sorry you're bored.
Uh, hey, everyone.
Oh, hey, Ann.
Leslie, can I talk to you for a minute?
Fine.
Tom, you're in charge.
Keep the momentum going.
Keep these minds working.
Absolutely, chief.
Okay.
Would you rather be able to fly, or speak fluent French?
Donna, go.
French.
I don't wanna freak you out, but another department filed a planning claim for Lot 48.
Who?
No.
Yeah.
Damn it.
The library?
Pawnee's library department is the most diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats I've ever seen.
They're like a biker gang, but instead of shotguns and crystal meth, they use political savvy and shushing.
It's gonna be okay.
It's not a done deal.
Yeah, you're right.
Thanks for pulling me out of there.
I need a good plan, though.
You know, I don't wanna cause a panic.
Newsflash, we're screwed.
We got a big problem with the library.
Punk-ass book jockeys.
Wait.
Why do we hate the library?
The library is the worst group of people ever assembled in history.
They're mean, conniving, rude, and extremely well read, which makes them very dangerous.
And they're trying to steal Lot 48 for a new branch.
What?
Get out of here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On 48?
I actually think a library would be nice that close to my house.
Let's bring the library down.
Yeah.
But I'm not about to say that in there.
A new branch?
Jerks.
You're kidding.
Oh, I hate them.
Okay.
We need to make contact with someone there.
Does anybody know anybody that works at the library?
Well, we actually kind of do.
The new Deputy Director of the department is Tammy Swanson.
Ron's ex-wife?
That's terrific.
Or is that awful?
I mean, he hates her, but he knows her.
Everything's okay.
Or is it just the same?
Leslie, you're thinking out loud again.
Am I?
I am.
Of course.
That bitch of an ex-wife is working for the library now.
That is perfect.
The worst person in the world working at the worst place in the world.
I have to go talk to her.
And you got to give me something I can use.
Does she have any weaknesses?
No.
What do you mean, no?
Everybody has a weakness.
Not machines.
I honestly believe that she was programmed by someone from the future to come back and destroy all happiness.
I see.
I knew that you had two ex-wives named Tammy, so I was hoping that there was one that you got along with and Nope.
I hate them both.
On my deathbed, my final wish is to have my ex-wives rushed to my side, so I can use my dying breath to tell them both to go to hell one last time.
Would I get married again?
Oh, absolutely.
If you don't believe in love, what's the point of living?
I'm just looking forward to a thoughtful debate with Tammy about the relative merits of parks versus libraries.
And in case something bad goes down, I wore my sharpest rings.
This one will tear you up.
Hello?
Hi.
I'm Leslie Knope.
I called a little while ago.
You have a lot of nerve showing your face here.
Excuse me?
You have overdue book fees totaling $3, missy.
That is so typical.
I should have known you'd use a low blow, dirty pool BS move like that.
No That's why everybody hates the library.
Here.
You know what?
Here's your $3.
Leslie, no And I'll see you in hell.
Leslie, Leslie, Leslie.
I'm just kidding.
My gosh, I mean, you did have $3 worth of fines, but I cleared them.
We government gals have to watch each other's backs, right?
I know this is a trap.
But I don't know how.
Okay.
Did you talk to Ron?
Ron tends to exaggerate when it comes to me.
I swear I don't have cloven feet.
Please.
Sit down.
Shine, shine, shine your shoes.
What do you say, sir?
Ma'am?
Shoeshine?
I won't look up your skirt.
Ann.
Whoa.
Oh, my gosh.
Crazy.
What are you doing?
It's me.
It's Andy.
Hi, Andy.
So, Ann, how you been?
Good.
Yeah, Leslie told me you were working here now.
Yeah, I just joined the rat race.
Chasing the cheese.
Racing the rats, trying to get the cheese.
Enough technical business talk.
You look ravishing.
Not a lot of customers, huh?
Yeah, business is a little slow.
It is definitely due to the economy.
I've been hearing a lot of people say that a lot about a lot of stuff.
Whoa, Mark.
You want those shoes shined?
I'll give you a discount because you're a friend of Ann's.
Well, I'm more than a friend of Ann's.
Not for long.
Sorry?
I don't know.
At least he finally has a real job.
When we were dating, the only job he had was sending audition tapes to Survivor and Deal or No Deal.
Hi, my name is Andy Dwyer, and I would be a perfect contestant for Deal or No Deal.
I want it to be a perfect park with a state-of-the-art swing set, and basketball courts, and off to the side, a lovely sitting area for kids with asthma to watch other kids play.
Wow.
If I'd had a park like that when I was growing up, I probably wouldn't have gone through such a prolonged mall-slut phase.
Well, that's the goal, Tammy.
Listen, you guys got there first.
I'm gonna withdraw my request for the lot, as a professional courtesy to you.
Government gals, right?
Government gals.
So you talked to Tammy?
What's it like to stare into the eye of Satan's butthole?
She's changed, Ron.
She's a different person.
I think it would be healthy for you to get a sense of closure.
Look at Mark and me.
We slept together.
We talked about it, we're still friends.
You slept with Brendanawicz?
No.
Look, Tammy and I don't work.
We are oil and water.
Or oil, and TNT, and C-4, and a detonator, and a butane torch.
Nothing good will come Wait.
She's here, isn't she?
Hi, Ron.
Tammy.
Good.
Good start.
I'm sorry about this, but I just really wanna talk to you.
Couldn't we go have a cup of coffee?
Let's get this over with.
Thanks, Ron.
It means a lot.
You're a miracle worker.
Oh.
Do you know what you just did?
Yes, Donna.
I got two people to put aside years of hostility and open a door to the possibility of friendship.
You were not here when Ron and Tammy got divorced.
I was.
Those two are crazy.
Yeah.
And you just opened the gates to Crazytown.
Frankly, I think Ron was acting like a baby, a little bit.
I mean, what is he afraid of?
Tammy's just a woman.
A nice woman.
You know, she's not a murderer.
She's not a dragon.
It's really good to see you, Ron.
You've aged horribly.
You son of a bitch.
That didn't take long.
Oh, my God.
What is your problem?
Nothing's changed, has it?
Who set the bed on fire, huh?
Excuse me, folks.
I did.
Okay?
Is that what you wanna hear?
Please, folks.
We're fine.
We're fine.
Okay.
I'm so sorry.
Please.
Fine.
Take it easy.
Oh, my God.
When you meddle in someone's personal life, it's just so rewarding.
Oh, God, yes.
Oh, God.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
Sir.
Ma'am.
Oh, God.
Oh, yes.
Baby.
Gun it.
The usual place.
Have Gun Will Travel reads the card of a man A knight without armor in a savage land Good morning, Jerry.
That is a beautiful sweater vest.
April.
You look like you could use $20.
Am I right?
Why?
'Cause you're a kid, and kids always need money.
I need money.
Ha!
That's why you're my favorite, Tom.
When Tiger Woods feels invincible, he wears a red shirt and black pants.
Good morning, Deputy.
Ron wears the same thing after he's had sex.
I'm a simple man.
I like pretty, dark-haired women and breakfast food.
But this stock photo I bought at a framing store isn't real.
Today, I got the real thing.
A naked Tammy made me breakfast this morning.
I should have taken a picture of it.
Hey, Tom.
What's up?
My girlfriend's ex is working and he's been pretty clear about wanting her back.
What do I do with that?
Mmm.
That's a tough one.
You should break up with her, and tell her to go out with me.
That's good.
Can I ask you another question?
Why did I come to you for advice?
Okay.
I think you should play this one cool, man.
Be the grown-up.
Take the high road.
Yeah.
Ann's a classy chick.
If you get down in the mud, you're just gonna lose her respect.
You've just made a surprising amount of sense, Tom.
Thank you.
I've never taken the high road.
But I tell other people to.
'Cause then there's more room for me on the low road.
So, how did your coffee with Tammy go?
Leslie, I can't thank you enough for sticking your nose where it didn't belong.
I knew it.
So what did you guys talk about?
Old times?
Oh, I love talking about old times.
New times are great, too, but there's just something about old times, you know what I mean?
We didn't talk.
We made love.
Oh, my.
Mmm.
Good.
Well, spare me the details.
I'm just happy.
It was so intense, I didn't know where my flesh stopped and hers began.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Our marriage was always a complete disaster, but we did have that.
The two of us.
It's like doing peyote and sneezing, slowly, for six hours.
This seems like a private matter, but I'm so That woman really knows her way around a penis.
Okay.
Well, I'm happy that it went well and that you enjoyed your coffee.
I truly believe that everyone should be friends with their exes.
I can't even tell you how many of my exes' weddings I've been to.
They're reading their old divorce papers.
"Three fistfuls of hair".
That's not even possible.
Well, I'm too classy to say "I told you so," Donna.
So I wrote it on a Post-it.
Leslie.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
I mean, you spend so much time worrying about this park, but really, who cares?
I care.
I care a lot.
It's kind of my thing, remember?
But at the end of the day, what does it matter if the lot becomes a park, or a museum, or a megachurch?
Or a library.
Nobody said "library".
Ron, have you been talking to Tammy about the lot?
No.
I swear on a grave.
Oh, my God.
Ron, tell me the truth.
Are you giving her the lot?
Not giving.
We have discussed a trade.
For what?
More Excuse me?
More sex.
Ugh!
Tammy, can I speak with you for a second?
I know what you're doing.
You don't care about Ron.
You're just using him to get Lot 48 for your library.
Leslie, that's crazy.
And correct.
Why are you doing this?
Les, there are two kinds of women in this world.
There are women who work hard and stress out about doing the right thing.
And then there are women who are cool.
You could either be a Cleopatra or you could be an Eleanor Roosevelt.
I'd rather be Cleopatra.
What kind of lunatic would wanna be Cleopatra over Eleanor Roosevelt?
Haven't you ever messed with a man's head just to see what you could get him to do for you?
We do it all the time in the Library Department.
You should come join us sometime.
I would never work at the Library Department.
I'm gonna tell Ron what you just said, and this little game that you're playing is gonna be over.
Okeydoke.
Yeah, you better run.
We're no longer government gals.
Look, we need to talk.
Ron, no.
The Planning Department Re-prioritization Document?
Calm down, I haven't signed it yet.
Yeah, well, you're going to.
Because Tammy wants you to, and you do everything that she wants.
She made some really good points about libraries.
Are you even listening to yourself?
You're defending the library now?
Ron, the library?
Of all the horrifying, miserable things in the world?
Some people like libraries.
I can't even believe what I'm hearing.
"Some people like libraries".
Ron, she's in your head.
You said that she was a manipulative monster, and you were right.
No.
No.
Tammy's changed.
Look me in the eye and tell me that she's changed.
Look me in the eye.
I'm so screwed, Knope.
Her hooks are in my brain.
Yep.
She has all the power and I have nothing.
I'm so little.
Why don't you just break up with her?
I don't think I can.
We would just end up naked, and I'd give her your lot, and my house, and God knows what else.
I have no control over my actions.
It's like she's crawled up inside of me.
Oh, God, Ron, I don't wanna hear about your disgusting sex anymore.
Okay?
Now sack up.
You are Ron freaking Swanson.
Not around her, I'm not.
It took years of intense, focused hatred to get over her, and now I've undone all that great work.
You've got to help me break up with her.
I don't think I should get involved in this.
Oh, now you don't wanna get involved?
"It's just coffee, Ron".
"She's changed, Ron".
"I let Mark nail me and we're still friends".
Okay.
I would never use those words.
I never said Point taken.
Let's go dump your ex.
Thank you.
So, would you like to be in the room when I tell her it's over, or would you rather wait outside?
In the room.
I don't want her to think I'm a wimp.
Here're the ground rules.
Don't talk to her.
Do not make eye contact with her.
Don't believe anything she says.
Just sit there, like a potted plant.
Can you do that?
Come on.
Do you have any tong Mark.
Hey.
Hey.
Donna.
So, how's the shoeshine game?
I'm on a break, one of the many advantages of owning your own business.
You know that's not your situation, right?
Yeah.
Listen, Donna.
Yes.
Quick question.
Ann is trying to decide between Mark and myself.
No, she's not, actually.
If you had to choose, who would you choose?
Right now, on the spot.
I'm not sure.
Why don't you spin around for me?
You know what?
Can we talk privately?
Sure.
Just out here.
Mmm.
Andy.
So, Tammy, for that and many other reasons, Ron has decided to end this relationship.
Wait a minute.
Ron brought you here to break up with me for him?
She volunteered.
Leslie, Ron doesn't wanna break up with me.
What Ron wants to do is leave here right now, go to the sleaziest motel in town, and wrap himself around me like a coiled snake.
No, he doesn't.
I'm pretty sure he does.
See?
He's completely over you.
Look, I understand that this Ann situation is awkward.
But I like you a lot as a dude.
And I just hope that there is some way that we can both be mature, and maybe be friends.
Yeah.
I doubt it.
I mean, I think you're a cool dude, too.
I like you as well.
But I'm still in love with Ann.
I couldn't have been more upfront about that.
Is punching allowed on the high road?
I'm sorry, Leslie.
She wins.
I can't resist her.
God, Ron, you have to.
Stay out of this.
This is our relationship.
He's my man.
And we have something twisted and beautiful.
Oh.
You want Ron.
That's what this is all about.
No.
That's insane.
Fine, I had one dream.
But no, no.
Baby, don't you see what's happening here?
She's manipulating you because she's jealous of me, and the things I get to do to your body and face.
I'm here because Ron is my friend, and I don't like seeing my friends miserable.
And you, Tammy, you make him miserable.
So, Ron, you can give her the lot, or don't, whatever.
Just, please, find a way to be happy.
Knope.
Wait.
Ron, it's okay.
Just sign the thing.
No, Leslie, it's not okay.
You just put my needs in front of your own.
No woman has ever done that for me before.
I'm sure that's not true.
You see the kind of women that I choose, right?
Look, just wait for me downstairs.
If I'm not down in five minutes, it's only because I'm receiving a pleasure so intense Oh, my God.
What the hell are you doing?
"Andy and Ann's Family Shoeshine"?
Andy, Ann, I thought it had a nice ring to it.
Oh, my God.
Look, Mark has been really cool about all this, and you're throwing it in his face.
Look, I still have feelings for you.
Okay?
I said it.
What do you want me to do?
Not mention those feelings to your boyfriend?
Yes.
Yes.
And you might wanna take these pictures down.
Oh, my God.
Take those pictures down.
What?
Fine.
All of them.
I'm gonna.
Now.
Oh, my God.
Give me the bikini one.
The teeny one?
Bikini one.
You didn't give her the lot.
Let's get out of here.
Is part of your mustache missing?
Yes.
Just keep walking.
There's a pushpin in your face.
Leave it in.
Can't you walk faster?
My legs are shorter than yours.
Mmm.
We had a good run.
Thank you for saving my future park.
I know that must've been hard for you.
You didn't kill Tammy, did you?
I'm afraid she can't be killed.
To exes.
May they always stay that way.
Tammy is a mean person.
Come on, Ron.
You can do better than that.
She's a grade-A bitch.
There we go.
Every time she laughs, an angel dies.
Even telemarketers avoid her.
Her birth was payback for the sins of man.
But you know the worst thing about her?
She works for the library.
She works for the library.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Okay.
As everybody knows, The Spirit of Pawnee was defaced again last night.
What was it this time?
Chocolate pudding.
Huh.
That's new.
The mural that normally resides here is called The Spirit of Pawnee.
And it's very controversial.
We've had someone throw acid at it, tomato sauce.
Someone tried to stab it once.
We really need better security here.
We also need better, less-offensive history.
So, the city council has decided that The Spirit of Pawnee should be changed to something just a little less horrifying.
Now, since the murals were made by government employees back in the 1930s, we thought it might be fun if each department submitted a design for a new mural.
And you'll submit your concepts tomorrow afternoon.
All righty, folks?
Thank you very much.
Hey, Leslie.
What's your design going to be?
A tree?
Joe, you work in Sewage.
Your department literally specializes in crap.
You really want to do this?
I told you before.
"Crap" is a slang term.
And I don't like that term.
But at least we don't specialize in losing, like you guys.
Sewage.
Let's roll.
Damn!
How does Sewage always get the hottest interns?
Guys, this department has the chance to design something that could be in this building forever.
This could be our legacy.
I thought building a park on Lot Well, you can have two legacies.
Look at Madonna.
Great singer, amazing arms.
Look at O.J. Simpson.
Heisman Trophy winner, Naked Gun.
Mmm-hmm.
No offense, Leslie, but I'm not an artist.
Oh, that's not true, Donna.
I've seen your fingernails.
Um, I pay someone to do this.
Really?
Oh, well, shoot.
Anyway, I'm ordering all of you to design a mural.
Uh, only Ron can order the whole department to do something.
Ron?
Order them to do this.
Do whatever Leslie says.
Okay.
So, here are your supplies.
I want you to go and find the spirit of Pawnee.
And make me a sketch.
And it needs to be breathtaking and moving and historical and better than every department.
And you have one hour.
Designers.
Make it work.
Tim Gunn.
You, my friend, are ready to go dancing.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
Next?
Andrew.
Looking good.
Business is booming.
Yeah.
Hey.
Ron, how about you?
Need a little dog waxing?
It's only 5 bucks, and I'll let you cut in front of this guy.
What?
Come on.
Beat it.
This is Ron Swanson we're talking about.
I'm impressed with Andy.
Pulling himself up by his bootstraps.
He reminds me of me.
I got my first job when I was nine.
Worked at a sheet metal factory.
In two weeks, I was running the floor.
Child labor laws are ruining this country.
Do you have a key in your shoe?
No.
No, I have a bunion that's practically its own toe.
Normally, the pain howls through my loafers like a banshee on the moors.
But for these past three minutes, it's been reduced to a faint growl.
Okay.
That's neat.
Well, hey.
We are all finished.
Well, that was great.
Thank you, son.
No sweat.
Next?
You shouldn't let your friends cut in line.
It's not good business.
You want to know what else isn't good business?
That guy's my friend.
Right.
I'm saying you shouldn't let your friends cut in line.
All right.
Sorry, pal.
Here.
Give me this.
Next.
So, what are you looking for exactly?
I don't know, man.
"The spirit of Pawnee".
That's all I got.
Here.
Just give me $20 worth of art.
Just something that seems personal, that only I could have done.
Tell me about yourself.
No.
Just paint.
I have no interest in art.
Let me clarify.
I have no interest in non-nude images.
Dude, what the hell kind of art is this?
It looks like a lizard puking up Skittles.
I'm an abstract expressionist.
No, you're a con artist.
And I'm a guy that's out 20 bucks.
Ugh.
Whatever.
I'm a terrible artist.
But the Parks Department has done so much for me that if I can help them out in any way, I will.
Oh, God.
Maybe I should just give them all free flu shots.
I know everything about this town and these murals.
And that's why this is a dream come true.
Literally.
I have had a dream where I designed a mural.
But then it turned into a nightmare, because the mural started talking, and it came alive and it was whispering.
And I couldn't hear what it was saying, so I leaned in close, and then it ate me.
At one point, Gina Gershon was there.
My piece is truly going to capture the spirit of Pawnee.
I never understood the term "elbow grease".
I guess it's not really grease.
Just hard work.
Oh, hey, Ron.
Nice, shiny shoes you got there.
Oh, hey.
I was just I think Oh, no.
Shoot.
Actually, it looks like I scuffed this one.
Do you need your money back, Ron?
Because I already spent it.
Really?
How did Never mind.
I think I'll just take another full polish.
Can I cut in line again?
I feel right at home as a shoe shiner.
I have no idea what I'm doing, but I know I'm doing it really, really well.
Okay!
Let's get going with the spirit of Pawnee.
Ann, you go first.
Okay.
Um Okay.
Well, since it's the Parks Department, I thought I would design a pretty park.
With dogs playing.
And I can't really draw, so I just cut some stuff out of a magazine.
That looks like something a death row convict would make in art therapy.
Dude, I tried.
And you failed.
It's dogs and people playing in a park.
It's cute.
It's okay, sweetheart.
You can't make art, because you are art.
You're beautiful.
But that sucks.
Okay.
Let's see yours.
Fine.
Mine is amazing.
It's going to blow your mind.
Okay.
This is some professional-ass art right here.
I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at.
It's abstract, Leslie.
Over here, you've got some shapes.
And then you come over to this side You know, it's actually kind of interesting.
Each shape is its own thing.
But then when it comes together, it really gives you a sense of completion.
Hmm.
A piece of art caused me to have an emotional reaction.
Is that normal?
So, it's the Last Supper, but with famous people from Indiana.
Mmm-hmm.
John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson, uh, David Letterman, Vivica A. Fox.
Okay, so, here's where it gets a little dicey.
Because there's not that many celebrities from Indiana.
So, a NASCAR.
Uh, my friend, Becky.
Ron Swanson.
Donna?
Who's the Jesus?
That would be Greg Kinnear.
I didn't know he was from Indiana.
Yeah, you know, I read that he was.
Oh.
Do you think he's the best choice for Jesus?
I mean, he was great on ER.
Greg Kinnear wasn't in ER.
Yeah, he was.
I don't think that he was.
Who am I thinking of?
Okay.
Next?
Wow.
Really good, Jerry.
For my murinal, I was inspired by the death of my grandma.
You said "murinal".
She No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
You said "murinal.
" I heard it.
Anyway, she Jerry.
Why don't you put that murinal in the men's room so people can murinate all over it?
Jerry.
Go to the doctor.
You might have a murinary tract infection.
I just wanted to show you my art.
Murinal!
Murinal!
Murinal!
Disqualified!
It's pointillism.
And each dot is a photo of a citizen of the town.
No one cares.
At all.
Okay.
So, this is a multimedia project.
First, a bunch of rats made out of garbage.
And this is a TV screen.
It'll be like a big, flat-screen TV, and it will play looped video of knee surgeries.
And then this is a human-sized hamster wheel that will be next to the mural if we can get one.
And it will be spinning and there will be, like, a fat guy in it all the time, like, screaming and, like, eating raw beef and, like, bleeding.
And, like, blood will, like, come out of his mouth and stuff.
And that'll be, like, right next to the mural.
I have one question.
Why?
If you have to ask, you don't get it.
I don't think they really got the assignment.
If we're gonna beat all the other departments, we have to choose something that will stand the test of time.
Like the Mona Lisa.
Or the music of Squeeze.
June 8, 1922.
The Pawnee Bread Factory burned to the ground.
We lost a lot of good bread that day.
As well as several human lives.
And it also made the whole town smell like toast.
Which one resident described as "disturbingly enticing".
But I digress.
The point is we rebuilt Pawnee to the wonderful town that it is today.
Why would you want a mural that shows people dying when you could have shapes that come alive?
Well, because it's the most famous event in our town's history.
And people love voting for tragedy.
Look at the Oscars.
This is our Holocaust movie.
This is our English Patient.
It sounds like you're exploiting the tragedy.
See, Ann gets it.
Okay.
Time to vote, everybody.
Cast your votes.
May the best, most tragic project win.
When we started this, we were six different voices with six ideas for a mural.
And then those six voices came together as a team.
There are no losers today.
But there is one winner, us.
The Parks Department.
Tom, the results of the vote, please.
One-to-one-to-one- to-one-to-one-to-one.
We all voted for ourselves, didn't we?
Yeah.
Okay.
Third time today.
Mmm.
That's a good shoeshine.
What the man?
I I don't know what happened.
Frankly.
I emitted a noise.
The noise was involuntary.
Sometimes, a sound is just a sound.
You know?
We need to whittle these down.
Can we all agree on eliminating any of these designs?
Ann's blows.
Wow.
Don't hold back.
No offense, but it's a giant picture of a park.
That's not art.
Well, at least it's not a fat human hamster eating meat.
You don't even work here.
Okay, guys, you both have a point.
Ann, yours was a little trite.
And April, yours was hellish and might make someone vomit.
Thank you.
Look, there's something about those shapes.
There's some emotional art right there.
Any kid could do that.
No kid could do that.
Only God could do that.
What is so great about the shapes?
He likes the shapes, okay?
And he's part of the team.
So, here.
Take these scissors and cut out your favorite shapes.
And then we'll put them on a new team mural.
We're going to make a new design that takes the best parts of all of our designs.
It's like if you got Michelangelo and Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis from Garfield to do one painting.
Imagine how good that painting would be.
I think it's really good.
I'll be right back.
Brendanawicz!
We need you for something.
Can it wait?
I am so swamped here.
Ann's in trouble.
We think it might be pills.
What?
No.
That's a lie.
But this is just as important.
We need you to look at a piece of art.
Oh, God.
What is that?
This is our entry for the mural contest.
We couldn't decide on one design, so we took parts that we all liked of our designs, and then we just kind of smushed it into a thing.
Well, you made a camel.
You've never heard that saying?
The camel was actually a horse designed by a committee.
And what you guys have here is one ugly camel.
Featuring Bill Paxton.
Greg Kinnear.
Right.
Greg Kinnear.
Oh!
Is Bill Paxton from Indiana?
You have to save us.
You have to design something.
Leslie, I'm not an artist.
Yes, you are.
I've seen you sketch things.
Uh, yeah, like poles for stop signs.
That everybody stops and looks at.
By law, Leslie.
They're required to.
Look, Mark.
Please.
You're the only one of us who's actually got any talent.
I know you'll do something good.
And I really, really want to win this.
Please?
What are you going to do tonight?
I was going to go to Arby's and watch Frontline.
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay.
So, it is an old man feeding pigeons in a park.
Uh The spirit of Pawnee?
Maybe?
You got to be kidding me.
How is that better than my park scene?
It isn't.
And that's saying something.
And who's the man?
Is he famous?
Is it Martin Landau?
Look, I have no dog in this fight.
I'm just saying that this will win.
It's nothing.
It's mush.
There's not even one shape in there, Mark.
Where are the shapes?
I'm not saying that this is any good.
I'm saying that this will win.
It's mass appeal.
It's like what motels put up, and it hangs there for years, and no one ever throws acid at it.
Mmm.
Who did this?
I like it.
Seriously?
I mean Sorry.
Yeah.
It comforts me.
That'll win.
This is garbage.
We've got to go back to the shapes.
No.
This is boring.
We got to go back to the garbage.
I would take the shapes over this.
I mean, come on.
I wouldn't take the shapes over anything.
I'd take Jerry's murinal over this.
No, guys.
This is the one.
What?
Sorry.
Mark's right.
This is an outrage.
Mark's not even in the department.
Right.
Neither is Ann.
But Ann's hot.
And that counts for something.
Whatever happened to, "We're the Parks Department!
Rah-rah-rah!
"Down with the Sewage Department"!
Yeah, we spent all day here for no reason.
We have a reason.
We're going to win.
That's our reason.
Our designs are not going to win.
Mark's might win.
How great would it be if we won, you guys?
You'll feel a lot better, I promise you, after you win.
We're going with this one.
All right.
I'll see you at the presentation tomorrow.
That is an order, team.
Go team!
Team dismissed.
Yes, we are a team.
But I am the team leader.
So, I made a bold decision.
We're playing it safe.
Hey, Knope.
How's life in the Parks De-fart-ment?
Better than life in the Sewage De-fart-ment.
Which makes more sense.
Whatever.
You guys are screwed.
Get used to this.
Because it's going to be hanging on the wall right outside your door for the next 100 years.
That was pretty good.
You think they're going to win?
No.
No.
They went super patriotic.
It's a classic mistake.
It seems crowd-pleasing, but it's still a stance.
And in government, there's always someone who will oppose a stance.
Us?
Old man feeding pigeons?
No stance.
Absolutely no point of view whatsoever.
No point of view.
Smart.
No.
I haven't been back.
I wish him good luck in his business.
And yes, I will absolutely go back to get my shoes shined soon.
I don't, frankly, see why this is a topic for discussion.
Oh, hey, Ron.
What's up?
Uh Andy, you know, the thing the other day?
Other day, other day Yeah.
Oh, yesterday?
I am That That was I feel I'm okay You know, I'd be okay if we I'd be okay if we never mentioned it again.
Never mention what again?
The moan, Ron.
The weird moan you made.
That was super weird.
Do you not remember that?
I talked about it with the lady who went after you for a half an hour.
She said she thought it was an animal Okay.
It was just an odd moment.
Let's just Let's just not talk about it anymore.
That's what I was trying to say.
But, yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Good time.
Ms. Knope.
Chief Konner.
What do you got there?
Well, we aren't really artists.
But we gave it a shot.
It's your basic dogs playing poker, but with an everything's-on-fire theme.
This is my nephew over here.
Hmm.
And this is an attractive lady with a hamburger for a head.
Just some stuff we liked, you know?
Anyway, we had a lot of fun putting it together.
Well, good luck.
Thanks.
We think it's a winner.
Go ahead.
What?
Camel's way more fun.
I want my team back.
And my team made this hot, crazy camel mess.
So, this is what we're going to submit.
Even if it means we lose.
God, I hope we win.
But we're definitely going to lose.
Probably.
All right.
Let's get in there and show them how Parks gets it done.
Yeah.
And Ann.
How Ann gets it done.
Yes!
Let's go!
What are the shapes?
The shapes are awesome, is what they are.
You can't handle it.
No, I actually like them.
Forgive me.
Is that Michael Jackson?
Yes.
The pride of Indiana.
That's right.
So, it's relevant.
Who is he carrying?
Jesus Greg Kinnear.
You know, it looks like he's carrying Kinnear into the burning building.
Oh, well, that's because he's moonwalking.
So, he should be going the other way.
That did not occur to me.
Sorry.
So, there you go.
The Spirit of Pawnee.
We didn't win.
But neither did anyone else.
They realized it was going to cost a ton of money to hire a muralist.
So, they're just going to restore the old one.
They're changing the title to The Diversity Express.
Oh, well.
No.
No.
It's not as good as the other one.
I don't know what you mean by "good".
Neither do I!
Just do another one.
You know, I have actual assignments that I have to finish for art school?
Shut up and do more art for me.
This one's racist.
It's beautiful.
I've looked at this for five hours now.
I like the green one.
And the red circle right here.
I'm tearing up, man.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
And I'm like, "What"?
It's pretty great having Andy working in the building.
The guy is so much fun.
His new thing?
Piggyback rides!
Anytime you want.
Piggyback!
Piggyback!
Move!
Piggyback!
Bam!
Piggyback!
Bam!
Mark!
Brendanawicz!
Giddyup!
Giddyup!
Oh!
Councilman Howser.
Hello.
Hello.
Did you get my proposal for the possible rezoning of Lot 48?
I have been busy.
I know.
But I think it would be a really great thing for the neighborhood.
I don't doubt it.
But it's really a question of resource allocation.
And I completely understand that.
But you and I both know that if we wanna find the money, we can.
I'm running late.
Oh, I'll walk with you.
See, the thing is, when we allocate money for parks Just a reminder.
Tomorrow's a half-day.
Jerry, Mark and I have to conduct the annual trail survey at Slippery Elm Park.
Ron, I had the trail survey hats made to commemorate the trip.
Nice, Jerry.
Oh, and if you have any questions about the details, feel free to shoot me an email.
The only trails he's gonna be surveying are trails of lies and deception.
Ron has a special deal with the park rangers.
Every November, they let him use their cabin so he can go on a secret hunting trip with all the guys in the office.
Not all the guys.
He's never taken me.
Fine, all the men.
Ron, let's cut the bull.
I want me, Tom and all the other ladies included on your hunting trip.
Hunting trip?
We're doing a trail survey, Leslie.
You're literally listening to turkey calls.
Is this not rap?
Come on.
All right.
Look, it's not just a hunting trip, it's a tradition.
I am really good at hunting and I'm even better at being one of the guys.
Well, it's a work event, so legally I can't stop you from coming.
Yes!
This is gonna be so fun!
I'll bring S'mores.
And just like that the one tiny aspect of government I enjoyed was clubbed to death before my eyes.
April!
I need you to do something for me.
I'm going hunting tomorrow, so call the State Parks Office and get verbal confirmation that our budget documentation is in.
Can I just tell you the or do you want me to write it down?
I'll write it down.
Can you handle this?
You want me to dial a number and then read another number out loud?
Yes.
Can you handle this?
No.
Well, try, okay?
And if you do it, I will name the first turkey I shoot after you.
Cool.
Ann!
Ready to bag some birds?
Nope.
But I am ready to relax by the fire and get my Real Simple magazine on.
Well, if you change your mind, you're now officially a licensed Indiana hunter.
Oh, gross.
Hello, you have reached the Indiana State Parks Department.
Your call is very important to us.
Please stay on the line.
All right, here we go!
Here we are!
There he is.
There's Ron!
Oh, it's pretty!
I know.
I thought it was gonna be gross.
Holy cow.
Ron, it is good to be back.
Sneak attack!
Damn it!
I am the Pants King!
Bow to me.
Bow!
I bow!
I am the Pants I am the Pants Queen.
What the hell?
Bow to the Pants Queen.
When you're out with the boys, you gotta be ready for a good pantsing.
That's why I have suspenders that connect my bra to my jeans.
Ron 'P.
Diddy' Combs.
I have to admit, this place is pretty tight.
May I interest anyone in some chew?
Nice touch, Haverford.
Let me get some of that.
You sure?
Yeah.
I would not have pegged you as a user of mouth tobacco.
I'm full of surprises, Ron.
Oh, man.
My stomach's a little upset.
I feel a little queasy.
Yeah, that might be the chew.
You could spit it out.
I swallowed it.
You're supposed to swallow it, right?
No.
All right.
Poor little buddy.
Why they call it chew and not swallow.
Am I right, Ron?
Yes, you are right.
All right, safety basics!
Donna, can you tell me why it's bad to look down the barrel of your gun?
Is that a trick question?
No, Donna, don't!
Please!
Rule number one, do not point the weapon at a person.
That includes your own face, Donna.
Now, every year, before we go on our first hunt, we do a toast.
So, grab a beer.
To the hunt.
Here, here.
Here, here.
And to the hunters!
The only way to defeat the beast is to find the beast within.
Pretty good.
Here, here!
Here, here!
Yeah!
Right on!
Cheers.
Ron, your toast sucked.
The traditional toast is "To the hunt"!
And it is said by me.
You all set, Mark?
Oh, I was thinking maybe we could do mixed doubles, you know?
Boy-girl, boy-girl.
Leslie, you said that we were gonna hunt together.
Oh, Ann, I always forget because you're so pretty, you're not used to rejection.
I have to hunt with Ron.
Ann, we'll go together.
Perfect!
All right, I hope you're ready to discuss some college bowl game scenarios!
Bully.
Andy!
Andy!
Can you come here, please?
Yeah.
What's up?
I've been on hold for, like, an hour and I really have to pee.
Can you just sit here for two seconds and just listen, please?
Yes.
Please?
Okay.
And if they answer, can you just read those numbers out loud?
Yeah.
Okay, thanks.
Now here's the female adolescent turkey.
Could you hear the difference?
No.
Turkeys can.
Boo-la, boo-la, boo-la!
Boo-la, boo-la, boo-la!
Boo-la, boo-la, boo-la!
We do that the first time one of us hits something.
Oh, cool!
Boo-la, boo-la No, no.
You missed it.
Look, Ron, I know this weekend, you were looking forward to a lot of man-on-man-on-man action, but I just wanted to say I'm very grateful that you let me come along on this trip.
That's fine.
I'm just glad you didn't end up inviting more of the motor What the hell?
Give me some warning!
I saw a quail.
Sorry, man, you snooze, you lose.
Boo-la, boo-la, boo-la!
Boo-la, boo-la, boo-la!
I think this is gonna be a really good bonding sesh for me and Ron.
Guys love it when you can show them you're better than they are at something they love.
Hey, check this out.
I am on hold with the State Parks Department I am on hold, so suck on my butt Nice.
Yeah.
They didn't answer, obviously.
Where is everyone?
Hunting trip.
Hunting trip?
Did Mark go?
Yeah.
That's cool, at least he's not with Ann.
No, Ann's there.
God!
How come he gets to do all the things I wanna do?
Go hunting, Ann.
Maybe a deer will eat him.
That would be really awesome.
But I don't think that will happen, probably.
You're surprised that my breasts didn't throw my aim off?
Leslie, please.
I don't care that you're a girl.
I just don't like change.
I like going to the same place with the same people, telling the same stories and seeing who can bag the most turkeys.
It seems like you like to go hunting with the same people 'cause you know you can beat them.
A hundred bucks says I bag more birds than you.
You're on.
Let's split up.
I do it better alone.
Yeah, you do!
See?
Just one of the guys.
Your favorite kind of cake can't be birthday cake.
That's like saying your favorite kind of cereal is breakfast cereal.
Mmm, I love breakfast cereal.
Look!
Some kind of bird!
Let's kill it!
You talking to me, bitch?
What were you aiming at?
Nothing.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I can understand why people like that.
Right?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah.
And keeping one's eyes open is always a good rule of thumb around guns.
This is such a great day.
See, at my house, I got a wife and three beautiful daughters.
But this trip, it is the one time of year I get to pee standing up.
I love that sound.
I've been shot!
I've been shot!
Somebody shot me in the head!
Boo-la, boo-la, boo-la.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I gotta pee.
Over here.
All right, right there.
Ron, I got your hat!
Ron, I have your hat!
Oh, my God!
Are you in a lot of pain?
I was shot in the head with a shotgun.
Ron, it's actually not that serious.
I just need you to stay calm, okay?
Yeah, I'm just gonna stay angry.
I find that relaxes me.
Okay, Ron, we called 911 and they're gonna send a ranger.
Oh, damn!
This is a mess.
The rangers won't let us come back next year.
No!
We're not gonna think about that right now.
You guys, can you just put him on the day bed in the carcass room?
Day bed?
Yeah.
Sure.
Okay, now.
Hold on!
Hold on!
Is that Donna?
Donna?
Okay, easy.
Donna?
Don't worry.
Are you okay?
What?
Is it your heart?
Are you having trouble breathing?
It's my car.
Someone shot my car!
Okay.
Here's your Scotch, Ron.
Okay, Jerry.
Jerry's here.
Here you go.
Here's your Scotch, Ron.
There we go, Ron.
Okay.
Hey, you know what is great?
Ann's gonna take care of you.
And Ann is the best nurse in North America.
All right.
There you go.
What?
You okay?
Did you shoot me?
What?
No!
There was a bird kind of near me, and I know how desperate you were to prove yourself.
No.
No, I swear, I didn't.
Ron, I swear to God, I've never shot anyone.
Well, you better find out who it was.
And then, purchase them a coffin, because I'm gonna rip them apart.
Okay.
Marco!
Polo!
Marco!
Polo!
Marco?
Polo!
Marco!
Polo!
Hey.
Okay.
How are you feeling?
How are you feeling?
Are you dizzy?
Are you dizzy or Are you light-headed?
When I look at my palm, I see a lady's mouth French kissing a dog.
Is that normal?
Is that normal?
Well, the pain medication I gave you is pretty strong.
Donna uses it for menstrual cramps.
How many did you take?
Seven.
Eight.
But I washed them down with plenty of fluids.
No, Ron, you cannot drink Scotch with this.
You're gonna need to purge, right now!
Okay?
No!
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm not wasting Can you open his mouth?
No.
Leslie?
Open his mouth.
What?
No.
Open his mouth.
Okay.
I'm not making myself throw up.
Oh, Ron.
I'm sorry we have to do this!
Ron, you have to.
Ron?
This is for your own good.
I will bite you!
Open your mouth!
Leslie, get Grab his mustache!
Oh, God!
Open your mouth!
Just a Open your mouth!
His shoulders!
Well, good news is Ron is resting comfortably.
Is he okay?
Is he gonna live?
I think so.
Although I am hoping that he has some memory loss.
On a scale of one to Chris Brown, how pissed is he?
Well, he's very curious about who shot him.
So, if you did it, just say, "I did it".
Come on, person who shot Ron.
Look, I think it's a little weird that nobody wants to admit that they shot Ron in the head.
Maybe Ron shot himself.
Hmm, he has seemed really depressed lately.
He was shot in the back of the head.
You're right.
He loves the back of his head.
He would never shoot himself there.
It could have been someone else that shot Ron.
Someone not in our group.
You think someone is hunting us?
Man is the most dangerous game.
To The Predator.
I did smell something out there.
And it wasn't human.
That was pine trees.
The Predator can see heat.
We should cover ourselves in mud.
It could still be out there.
Did you hear that?
Actually, I did hear something.
Okay.
There's someone out there.
I'm gonna get my gun.
Okay, Tom.
Scare him off and shoot over his head!
What's that gonna do?
I'm gonna shoot under its head!
Don't shoot anyone!
Whoa!
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
Tom!
Hey!
Don't shoot!
Hey!
It's Craig from Reinhold Mercedes!
Craig!
Craig, I got you, dog!
Craig!
Don't worry, I'm coming!
Attention, person who shot me in the head!
I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna tear you apart.
Ron!
Bed!
Now!
Okay.
Here.
That man wasn't my brother.
He was my husband.
How was that?
That wasn't good?
Yeah, you can do better.
All right.
Give me another one.
Okay.
I'm pregnant with Josh Groban's baby.
That was good.
You do one.
Okay.
What do you mean the squirrel took the nuts out of the Out of that kid's backpack and ate them?
But you have to give me a reason to spit.
To spit!
You asked me a Oh, oh, oh!
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't ask me a question.
I won't.
Okay.
Not a question.
Okay, ready?
Yeah.
I've lived in Pawnee my whole life.
That is a fact.
A fact about me.
And how Hey.
How is he?
He's pretty out of it.
He's talking about you in his sleep.
Good stuff?
No.
How's it going out there?
Terribly.
No one will admit they shot Ron.
And no one saw it happen.
I know what happened.
You do?
Listen, I heard about the accident.
And I need to know who is responsible.
I don't know.
Ron and I saw Jerry That's the problem.
I am.
I shot Ron Swanson.
You shot my Mercedes?
What?
No!
No!
Okay, follow my light.
No, not your whole head.
Just your eyes.
Just Yeah.
Okay.
What month is it?
November.
Why are you taking the blame for this?
Don't worry about it.
I know what I'm doing.
Just go look after Ron.
So what happened?
Did you forget to check the entire field?
I find a lot of women have problems with tunnel vision.
No.
I'm an excellent hunter.
How did you end up shooting a guy in the head then?
Fair enough.
I was walking in the woods and then I tripped and my gun went off.
Ah, so you forgot to put the safety on.
No, I always have the safety on.
I'm While I was tripping, I saw a quail and I shot at it.
In mid-trip?
No, that's Okay, fine.
I got that tunnel vision that girls get.
And that's what happened.
End of story.
I think you're hysterical because of all the excitement, obviously.
So, I'm just not following your story.
All right?
I let my emotions get the best of me.
I just I would I cared too much, I guess.
I was thinking with my lady parts.
I was walking and I felt something icky.
I thought there was gonna be chocolate.
I don't even remember.
I'm wearing a new bra and it closes in the front, so it popped open and it threw me off.
All I wanna do is have babies!
Are you single?
I'm just, like, going through a thing right now.
I guess when my life is incomplete I wanna shoot someone.
This would not happen if I had a penis.
What?
Bitches be crazy.
I'm good at tolerating pain.
I'm bad at math.
And I'm stupid.
I wonder what they're doing right now.
Probably making out on top of a deer carcass.
Super romantic.
You know, if I gave you a hickey, it would totally make Ann jealous.
I don't know, I think that would That's pretty gross.
Seems kind of weird.
What's weird about one friend sucking on another friend's neck?
When you put it that way, it doesn't sound that weird at all.
Yeah, it's not.
I gave my gay boyfriend's boyfriend a hickey and it totally made my gay boyfriend jealous.
Really?
All right.
Awesome.
I'm in.
I'm gonna go sterilize my neck.
Okay.
What?
You know, Leslie, the Super Bowl is in a couple of months.
I usually watch it with my brothers.
Maybe you could come by at halftime and shoot me in the head.
Ron, I'm really sorry that I ruined your weekend.
Perhaps next time I'm enjoying some alone time in the men's restroom, you could invite yourself into my stall and shoot me in the head.
Look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you Sure.
How about you shoot me in the head?
Oh, wait, you already did that.
Hey, Tom, can I talk to you for a second?
Hold on, this is amazing.
Now.
I need to talk to you now.
Okay.
Okay!
Whoa!
Ann!
Whoa, are we finally gonna do this?
Ow!
I saw you shoot Ron.
Okay?
Leslie covered for you, but I'm not gonna let her take any more crap from Ron on your sorry-ass behalf.
Okay, for the record, I was gonna come forward and I'll do it right now.
But afterwards, can we come back here and talk about us?
Maybe the next time I'm at the doctor's office getting my prostate examined, you could come by and shoot me in the head!
Excuse me, everyone.
Ron, I have something to say.
Hang on a minute, Tom, I'm not done berating Leslie.
It wasn't Leslie's fault.
She was covering for me because I didn't have a hunting license.
I was the one who shot you.
You didn't get a license?
What kind of moron doesn't get a license?
That's reckless endangerment, my son.
That's a $25,000 fine, minimum, and probably jail time.
But she covered for me, and I'm in the clear.
Yeah.
That's right.
She kept her mouth shut and now you're in the clear.
Well, Ron, you know, I couldn't let I know.
You did good.
You're a real stand-up guy.
I'm sorry I lost my temper before.
It was 'cause I was shot in the head by a moron.
Yeah.
Dude, Ron, I'm so sorry.
Apology not accepted, moron.
Pants King!
Pants Queen!
Hi, Ann.
Hey.
Mmm!
Turkey's great.
Hey, Ron Swanson!
Hey!
Ron Swanson!
Thank you.
Thank you, all.
Welcome back, Ron.
Oh, hey!
"Welcome back, Ron".
That's terrific.
Thanks, you guys.
Let's eat!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Leslie.
What's up, Ron?
I'm gonna need you to go up to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles on the fourth floor.
We gotta talk ourselves out of this late registration fee for the Parks van.
Come on.
I don't want to go to the fourth floor.
That is the creepiest place on Earth.
The fourth floor is awful.
The DMV, divorce filings, probation offices.
Ugh!
They put a popcorn machine up there just to brighten things up, but they used the wrong kind of oil, and a bunch of people had to get their throats replaced.
They'll only talk to you or me, and I can't go, because I don't want to.
Okay.
Hey, boo.
You're pretty.
Uh Thank you, sir.
Hey, girl.
Are you on probation?
I got clean urine.
You need female?
I got female.
I'm good, thank you.
Hey, you clean?
I buy, too.
Order.
Order!
Next case.
Indiana vs I know, I'm just telling you.
Tom and Wendy?
Popcorn?
So, Tom, how's everything in your life, generally?
Amazing.
Took a risk.
Bought some shoes online.
Paid off handsomely, as you can see.
Uh-huh.
And how are your institutions, that you're a part of?
Ah.
You heard about my divorce?
I saw you on the fourth floor.
I'm so, so sorry.
Honestly, it's fine.
Lasted longer than Avril Lavigne and the guy from Sum 41, am I right?
I don't know what those are.
Look, Tom, stop working.
Whoa!
Would have been nice to have saved that.
You should've auto-saved that.
Right.
That kind of feels like your fault.
Look, I've heard your voice when she calls you on the phone.
I've seen you look at her ass when she leaves the room.
You love her.
Leslie, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but I'm fine.
Look, look at my face.
Are you watching?
I did a little research, and divorce is the number two most stressful event in a person's life.
Of course, marriage is number seven.
So, watch out, everyone.
It's all bad.
We have to step up, for Tom's sake.
I think Tom seems fine.
Well, that is the problem.
Tom always seems like Mr. Slickster Cool Guy, but he's actually hiding his emotions underneath a very thick layer of Axe body spray.
We have to help him.
We are his safe bubble.
She's kind of right.
None of his family lives here, and all of his friends are frat guys and morons.
This seems like none of our business.
Be supportive, okay?
Don't be all, like, "No, I don't want to.
"I am a guy and I like fire and playing hockey and eating meat!
"No, no, says I"!
That was a really good Ron.
Thank you.
I don't know how to explain Hey, Mark.
The shoeshine stand still doesn't have that syphilis medication you were asking about.
Ann, hey!
What a coincidence!
Are you in this office purely for business reasons?
Pleasure, actually.
My boyfriend Mark works here.
He's sitting right next to me.
Hey, Andy.
What a surprise, running into you all day, every day, every single place that we are.
Likewise.
Well, I guess I'll see you guys around.
See you.
Oh!
Uh, also, Mark, again, we don't have those extra-small condoms you ordered.
I called the factory, it's gonna take a special order.
Not just because of the size, but because of the weird shape as well.
Something they've never dealt with before.
We'll talk.
Mark never asked me for any small, weirdly-shaped condoms.
I made that up.
Every day, I subtly chip away at their relationship.
Weakening it, little by little.
Where's Tom Haverford?
For sake.
So, you had a divorce , of course, of course And no one enjoys a divorce, of course I don't know what to do, man.
I can't be like, "Hey, Leslie, it's a green card marriage, I'm fine".
You know, Leslie just thinks you're a wounded animal, so her female instincts are kicking in.
Here's what you do.
Act sad, let her pull the thorn out of your paw and wrap a bandage around it.
That'll make her feel better.
She'll get off your jock.
You still can't tell anyone about the green card thing.
Apparently you can get in trouble even after a divorce.
Damn the man.
Well, hey, your secret's safe with me.
Thanks, Rondoleezza Rice.
Okay, everyone.
The rumors are true.
Wendy and I are splitting up.
Yeah, I'm really hurt.
I'm so sorry you feel that way, little friend.
Why don't we go out tonight, hit the town after work, huh?
We'll make it Tom's night.
You can go anywhere you want, our treat.
Oh, I know there's a really fun documentary about tandem bicycles at the art house.
It's supposed to be pretty unapologetic.
Or we could go to a restaurant Strip club?
Did somebody say strip club?
No Did somebody say strip club?
You did.
I definitely heard someone say strip club.
You just did.
Would the Glitter Factory be okay with whoever suggested strip club?
I don't think that's a good idea, Tom.
There is a great dinosaur-themed restaurant in Patterson.
It is called Jurassic Fork.
I have gone there three times a week for the last 15 years.
Ooh!
Dinosaurs, huh?
All right.
Sounds okay.
Okay!
It's gonna be a crazy night, guys!
I will see you at Jurassic Fork at 5:45 p. Yes.
Hi.
Welcome to Jurassic Fork, where the only thing that'll be extinct is your appetite.
You ready to order?
Yes.
I will have the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Veloci-Wrap.
I'm gonna get the Tricera-chops, please.
How do you want that cooked?
Medium roar.
Medium rare?
No, medium roar.
For legal reasons, we're not allowed to make puns about the temperature of the meats anymore.
I'll have the surf-and-turf-a-saurus, and a couple of bottles of wine.
I'm gonna need a lot of wine, so keep it flowing.
I'm not gonna be drinking anything.
Just wanted everybody to know that.
I'm not a big fan of group dinners where everybody splits the bill no matter what they get.
I ordered a Tyranna-Caesar salad, and that's all I'm paying for.
Hey, check it out.
They got pool.
Mark, you want to play a quick game?
Finally settle the debate about who's the better pool player?
I've never had that debate with anyone, Andy.
Come on, we'll put a little money on it.
Make it a little more interesting.
Andy, please.
No, I just figured because pool is all about angles and he's a failed architect that he might want to play pool.
Let's do it.
Really?
That worked?
How to hustle somebody in pool, by Andy Dwyer.
Step one, find the person you want to hustle.
Invite them to play pool.
Should they accept, you're in.
Here's what I think we should do.
Everyone should go around and say one thing that they love about Tom.
I'll start.
I really wish I could have your body.
What?
Ew!
Like, tied up, naked, in your basement?
No, no.
I mean, you're in good shape and you can eat whatever you want.
Well, that was weird, Jerry.
Ann, you go ahead.
I think Tom is really nice.
Also, if you guys want to give me your credit cards, I'll just divide it up myself, I don't mind.
Oh, my God!
Don't worry about it.
The restaurant will just divide it evenly.
Just enjoy yourself.
April, go ahead.
Tom is the only cool person in the office.
Ridiculous.
Donna?
I love you, Tom.
You're my little prince.
I just want to put you in a little cape and a little hat and just fly you around.
Thank you, Donna.
Hey, garçon.
I'm still feeling pretty sad.
Can I get two crème brûlées and another glass of bronto grigio?
I thought I had Tom all figured out, but it's almost like he's faking being sad.
Why would he do that?
And that's game.
I think you now owe me $25.
Shoot.
Someone had a pool table growing up, huh?
Hey, no, no.
What do you say we play again?
We'll make it a little more interesting.
Go double or nothing?
Why not?
Step two.
Lose to your opponent intentionally so they gain confidence.
Step two has been completed easily.
Very easily.
Mark is pretty good at pool.
So, how are you feeling, Tom?
Are you feeling okay?
I like pretending to be sad.
I now see why girls do it.
So, your arrangement with Wendy, it really was completely platonic?
Yeah.
Never so much as even kissed, except for a little peck at the wedding ceremony for appearances.
Uh, now that you're getting divorced, I sort of feel like there may be some potential with me and Wendy.
Would it be okay with you if I was to ask her out, once the fake dust settles?
Yeah, why not?
Sure.
Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me.
I'm gonna take a leak.
Oh!
That would be $6,400.
I accept checks and most major credit cards.
Yeah!
Mark is way better than me.
I'm gonna I'm gonna say that there is at least a chance that I didn't think this through completely.
I think I'm done, Andy.
Okay.
Forget money.
We'll play for something else.
You have nothing else to give me.
I have a T-shirt I tackled Eddie Vedder in.
It's literally priceless.
Okay, how about this?
If you win, you don't owe me any money, but if I win, you have to stop bugging me and Ann.
What are you talking about?
No more comments, no more showing up when we're hanging out together.
You have to leave us alone.
That doesn't seem like a very fair bet, Mark.
So, if I win, I also get Ann.
Okay, fine.
If you win, then you get Ann.
Rack them up!
Somebody punch someone!
So, how you doing, buddy?
Want some steak?
Champagne?
Think of something extravagant and we'll get it for you.
What do you want?
A cheese fountain?
A ruby?
A goose heart?
How about a marriage?
How about a non-divorce?
Tom, I'm sorry.
Maybe you guys just need some time apart, you know, to remember how much you care about each other.
Leslie, think about it.
Does our marriage really make sense to you?
She's a tall, beautiful surgeon.
I'm a short, beautiful government employeelclub promoter.
You're a club promoter?
Aspiring.
The point is, I never meant anything to her.
It wasn't even a real marriage.
Now, the sadness is pouring out of Tom, like blood from a pterodactyl after it's attacked by a T-Rex.
I have to take him to a place where he can't possibly be sad.
Oh, crap.
We are going to the Glitter Factory.
What?
Not me.
I can't go back there.
But if you see Jasmine, tell her she can keep Anthony, but I want my microwave back.
Okay, good.
You're gonna take April home.
No, I want to go to the Glitter Factory.
Well, drop out of school and start doing meth.
Let's go, everybody.
Leslie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but once you go in there, you will see things you cannot un-see.
I'm a feminist, okay?
I would never, ever go to a strip club.
I've gone on record that if I had to have a stripper's name, it would be "Equality".
But I'm willing to sacrifice all that I've worked for just to put a smile on your perverted little face.
So don't blow this.
All right.
Okay!
Lap dances are on me.
I mean, I'm paying for them.
They're not gonna actually be on me.
Got it.
I kind of feel like Jane Goodall studying the chimps, you know?
'Cause there are some feminist scholars who say that stripping is a feminist act.
There is a girl here that also works at Quiznos.
She's really nice to me here, but really mean to me at Quiznos.
Okay, Tom, go put these in places I do not approve of.
Leslie, I'm gonna put these in places you've never heard of.
Yeah, I've been a little down.
Totally natural.
I'm getting divorced.
But now, I'm ready to pull myself up by some g-strings.
God!
It is rough in here.
Is it always like this?
I wouldn't know.
Don't like strip clubs.
Smells like a wet mop in here.
And I get the feeling that every one of these women is running a low-grade fever.
You're one of the good ones, Ron.
Wait a minute.
Hello, beautiful.
Strippers do nothing for me.
I like a strong, salt-of-the-earth, self-possessed woman at the top of her field.
Your Steffi Grafs, your Sheryl Swoopeses.
But I will take a free breakfast buffet any time, any place.
Tomcat, pull up a mouth.
This buffet is unstoppable.
Yeah, I'm not hungry.
By the way, you're doing a bang-up job of looking sad about Wendy.
Does she make scrambled eggs?
No.
Take it down a notch.
You already won your Oscar, DiCaprio.
Coming on stage next is Angel.
Angel!
Ann, in case I don't sink this, it's been a real pleasure dating you.
Scratch on the eight!
I'm victorious.
I am awesome at pool and I hustled your ass.
Ann, take a moment to say goodbye.
I don't even know how to say this.
I am so sorry, and I will do my best to visit you on holidays.
Thanks, you tried.
I guess you're his now.
Do you want to get out of here?
I do.
Yeah.
Bye, Andy.
I know that, legally, Ann is now mine, but it weirdly doesn't feel that way.
All right, Tom!
This is Seabiscuit.
Sierra.
Sierra.
Sorry.
It's loud in here.
And I gave her money to writhe around on your parts.
Leslie, I don't want to do that.
Well, I already paid her.
Can I get my money back?
No.
Okay, so let her do her writhing.
All right.
I just gotta say, Sierra.
I really don't get why this cheers men up, because it's very insincere and it's very fleeting.
But go crazy, okay?
Give my friend here the works.
Really grind the sorrow out of him.
You got it.
And then, afterwards, maybe reconsider your profession, but for now, grind away.
Whoo!
Stripper dancing action!
This isn't working.
I don't want to do this.
Is it because you have a strong, positive female figure watching you?
No.
It's because I'm miserable.
Okay.
Never mind.
Thank you, Seabiscuit.
That'll be all.
All Glitter Factory girls, please come backstage.
Tom.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
This is honestly the saddest I've ever been.
Glitter Bomb!
Ah!
I've been to the Glitter Factory a million times.
That girl up there, she's my emergency contact.
But right now, I hate it here, and I just want to see Wendy.
Tom, it's perfectly normal to feel devastated when something's over.
It's exactly how I felt when that Planet Earth series ended.
Sixty days.
And then she's free to marry Ron Swanson.
What?
Ron?
He's gonna ask her out.
He told me.
But who cares?
If it's not him, it'll just be some other guy.
Swanson!
Did you tell Tom that you were gonna ask out Wendy?
It's complicated.
What is wrong with you?
I wish I wasn't alive to hear myself say this, but I am ashamed to be your deputy.
I don't get men.
If they're not wagering their girlfriends in pool, then they're trying to steal each other's wives.
It makes you question the whole notion of those bromance movies.
Tom.
Great!
Good, okay.
Could you carry him out of here, please?
And, you know, also maybe not have sex with his wife?
Thanks.
From the knees.
He weighs eight pounds.
Oh!
Oh.
Oh, boy.
Hi, Wendy.
We took Tom out tonight, and he had a little bit too much to drink.
Oh!
Okay.
Come on in.
Oh, my God.
You insensitive little hussy.
Excuse me?
Leslie, whoa.
Halt.
You're not even divorced yet and you're inviting other men over?
You were married?
Uh Technically.
Yeah, that's That's my husband.
Who's he carrying?
No.
No, that's his That's his boss.
My husband's the one that's being carried by his boss.
How's it going?
Good.
You know what, Wendy?
You and Ron will be perfect for each other.
You two should get married and start a club for people who betray Tom Haverford.
You have a lovely home.
So, where do you want this?
So, how you feeling?
Rough morning?
You know those hangover pills you can order on TV?
Mmm.
I threw up a bunch of them this morning.
I feel much better.
I know last night was really rough, but all I want for you is to be able to get over this.
Leslie, I need to tell you something.
Okay.
Uh The reason I was acting weird yesterday was Wendy and I have a green card marriage.
Oh, my God, because you're a Libyan!
No.
Damn it.
Wendy's from Canada.
Oh!
Oh.
Okay.
Wait.
Start again.
This Hey, Ann.
Mark.
You guys got a second?
It's about last night.
I hope I'm not gonna have to explain to you that you don't actually own me.
Of course not.
I never for one second thought that that was for real.
Look, you don't have to worry about me bothering you anymore.
You clearly have something going, and I should respect that.
Okay.
If you say "psych" right now I'm gonna be really pissed.
You remembered how much I like to say "psych".
But no, no.
This is no psych.
Andy, thank you for saying all that just now.
Sure.
Goodbye, A-Cakes.
Hello, Ann.
Goodbye, Ann.
Goodbye, Andy.
Oh, oh.
I thought for a second you were gonna chase after me right there, but you didn't, and that's okay.
I meant every word I said.
Aw, you like your wife?
That's a bummer.
Does anyone else know that you like your wife?
Does your wife know that you like your wife?
I didn't know until yesterday.
So don't tell anyone.
Don't tell Ron.
It's my problem.
How could there possibly still be glitter on me?
It takes forever to get off.
My crotch looks like a disco ball.
Leslie's sorry She called you selfish, of course She just didn't know the full story, of course But now that she does She's sorry, of course She loves being your deputy
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
We now go live to Councilman Bill Dexhart, who's giving a press conference about his sex scandal.
You are getting a rare glimpse at this exclusive, government-only event.
Each December, one department puts on a show that spoofs what happened in our town.
Prepare to laugh your Asnov!
Sid Asnov is a former city councilman.
Some of the jokes are sort of inside.
Councilman Dexhart, you're involved in yet another scandal?
That's crazier than Mayor Gunderson's dog, Rufus.
Yes, there is a new one, and it's a doozie.
I don't want to go into the details, but let me just say that it involves multiple women, a love child, nurses, rabbis, priests Hey!
Well, I hope you can all join me at my fundraiser tonight.
I am being supported, of course, by the Glitter Factory and 1-800-Mattress.
Classic!
Pawnee is a city that ain't very pretty And good government is our goal We may not be big And our mayor wears a wig But at least the raccoon infestation is under control It's the most wonderful time in Pawnee Lot 48 was once a horrible and disgusting pit, and now it's the site of Pawnee's Winter Wonderland.
This could not be more perfect if I had planned it myself.
Which I did.
And it's awesome.
So, let's talk skedge, guys.
The kids are gonna come at 9:00 a. M. on Saturday, and everyone's gonna do Santa for two hours, so I would just advise everyone, before you get in your costume, to go to the bathroom, so we can avoid what happened last year.
It was just farts.
with the youth choir, and I am proud to announce, for the first time ever this year, our tree lighting ceremony will be simulcast on Internet radio.
Thank you.
That's a really big deal.
It is.
Thank you.
Listening to that tree lighting is gonna be dope.
Okay.
Any questions, direct them to me.
Dismissed.
Hey, there was a message for you on the work voicemail.
Councilman Dexhart wants to meet with you at 9:00 p. M., the Boardwalk Lounge.
Shut up.
No.
I'm not scared.
I got nothing to apologize for.
I could've been a lot harder on him.
He got off easy.
And often.
Thank you, I'll be here all week!
You gotta tell me about him.
I don't know anything about him.
Okay.
He's 23, he's kind of my boyfriend, he's gay.
Last year we got drunk and he took me to the Ice Capades, and I didn't get him anything.
And he's gay?
Yeah.
Brokeback Mountain DVD.
No.
Fellows love that.
No.
Does he already have, like, chaps?
Like assless chaps?
You know what?
Forget it.
Okay.
Why are you asking me?
Because I don't know.
There's no one else to ask.
At least you're kind of young.
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna think about it.
Through the course of all day, I'm gonna mull it over.
It's all I'm gonna think about, but you're in good hands.
I'm gonna come up with something really, really good.
Really?
All right.
Yeah.
You got that?
Yeah.
Councilman Dexhart?
I'm Leslie Knope.
Thank you for meeting me.
It's my pleasure.
I am assuming this is about my performance in the Government Follies last night.
I'd just like to say that I have nothing to apologize for, except for perhaps being too incisive.
I don't want you to apologize.
I want to know who told you.
Who told me?
Mmm-hmm.
Nobody.
Nobody told me nothing!
What are we talking about?
Based on that skit, I know you heard about the new scandal that's about to break.
Who told you?
Was it the babysitter?
Was it the nurse who delivered our love child?
What?
All right, stop playing dumb.
You know damn well what happened.
I got the babysitter pregnant, then when she was in the delivery room, I had sex with not one, but four nurses in a supply closet, as well as a woman whose husband was getting a liver transplant.
Mmm.
Now, which one of them told you?
Was it the liver lady?
Well, I No one I haven't I haven't heard any of this, ever, in my whole life.
Oh!
Believe me, I would have remembered this.
Okay.
Well, in that case, everything I just told you was just a funny prank.
Oh!
Hi!
How was your meeting?
It was fine.
Pretty straightforward.
Short meeting.
He's a busy guy.
Yes, very busy.
Look at this article.
No!
What the The story of this story is that it won't stop developing.
The mystery woman who met with Councilman Dexhart last night appears to be a government employee named Leslie Norp.
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
According to unconfirmed reports in the Pawnee Sun, the two bent an elbow at this local watering hole, and although they left separately, no one knows where they woke up together.
Perd Hapley, Channel Four News.
All I did was write and perform in one amazing skit.
Leslie, it's the Pawnee Sun.
It's a tabloid.
Nobody else has written about it.
Yeah, no one believes that garbage.
Nobody even reads that thing.
Leslie!
What?
Nice work, girl.
Oh, God!
How do I fight back?
Give me some options.
Do you want me to seduce Perd Hapley?
How would that help?
I don't know.
I just want to see if I can do it.
April, I appreciate that, but I don't think it's something worth losing your virginity over.
Leslie, I don't know if this is important or not, but I have heard a lot of very, very interesting chatter around the shoeshine stand today.
Oh, my God!
Really?
What have you heard?
A lot of things.
Like, "Can you believe it"?
and, "The Parks lady boned Dexhart," and, "Of course she did, she's totally good to go".
And one guy was like, "I wouldn't hit that".
And the other guy was like, "Me neither".
And then this third guy was like, "I would".
So I don't know if that's helpful at all.
Well, keep your ear to the ground.
Okay.
I'll just I'm not gonna let these people intimidate me.
I'm gonna do my job.
I would be lying if I said that I never thought I would be involved in an incident like this.
Except I always assumed that I would be the politician and the man would be accused of sleeping with me.
And that man would be the vice president, and I would be the president.
Okay, all right.
Well, you look good.
You need to put some tights on, though, and I want you to make sure you keep your neckline nice and high.
Leslie Knope?
Alexa Softcastle, Pawnee Sun.
Can I ask you a few questions?
Don't say anything.
I'm not afraid to say anything.
Okay?
I have nothing to hide.
I'd never even met Councilman Dexhart before yesterday, and that's all I'm gonna say about the matter.
Some people are saying this isn't the first time that you've had sex with a married councilman.
Who's saying that?
Some people.
Okay.
This interview is over.
Go home, lay low.
The truth will come out.
I can't!
I have too much work to do.
This department is not gonna deputy-direct itself.
I think we can manage.
Just give me your schedule and we'll cover for you.
Okay.
I've made copies of Leslie's daily work schedule, so we'll just split into teams, and each team will take Damn, 10 items, and we'll knock this out.
I swear to you, I never even met the guy before last night.
It's okay.
I believe you.
You do?
'Course.
I think I know you pretty well, and that doesn't sound like you.
Thank you.
If I ever see that guy, I'm gonna punch him right in the face.
Yeah, that's sweet.
Use your nightstick.
Which meeting is this?
Reorganization of Local Auditing Systems.
Kill me.
Right.
First order of business.
Leslie?
Where's Leslie?
Oh, um, I gave her the day off, Paul.
Thought that was best.
Oh, yeah.
That's good.
So you'll be making the presentation then, Ron?
Yep.
Yes.
Hey, so, that kind of brings us to what I wanted to talk to you about.
I You know my Army reserve unit?
We got called up to active duty.
I ship out in four days.
Oh, my God!
Where you going?
San Diego.
Oh, my God!
It's not dangerous.
It's mostly maintenance.
But I'm going for, like, a year.
Maybe 18 months.
And I was kind of hoping that maybe you'd want to come with me.
Like, on a permanent type basis.
Well, I don't know, it's kind of a weird question.
I mean, I joined to put myself through college, and it's I'm just a desk jockey, but it's still It's rewarding.
So, yeah, I guess I'm in love with the Army.
Oh, Leslie?
Well, yeah.
Yeah, that makes a lot more sense.
Yeah, I'm definitely in love with Leslie.
That's affirmative.
I know this seems kind of fast, but I feel like we got something here.
I do, too.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You don't have to answer right away.
Well, you kind of do.
I mean, I need to know soon.
Wow!
Yeah.
Are you gonna go?
This whole Dexhart thing is not making me feel very attached to Pawnee right now.
San Diego.
Jeez.
Yeah.
You could learn how to surf.
I know how to surf.
I took lessons when I was a kid.
I'm actually pretty good.
I bet you are.
I would miss Leslie like crazy.
Aw!
All right, sorted out that payroll issue, this is done.
"Bring a case of beer to Sanitation".
Why?
Let's skip that one.
They can buy their own beer.
I'm getting hungry.
Let's get something to eat.
Hey, have you figured out what you're getting Ann for Christmas?
Oh, I got her a pretty great computer bag.
Yeah?
That's a terrible gift.
No, no, Tom, she needs one.
She mentioned it to me two months ago, and I wrote it down.
That's what's called being an amazing boyfriend.
Have you seen Ann?
You know how hot she is?
Men give women of that caliber speedboats, private jets, not computer bags.
Okay.
What do you think I should get her?
Diamonds.
Can't go wrong with diamonds.
Diamonds?
There isn't a woman alive who doesn't love diamonds.
Even the super left-wing chicks that saw Blood Diamond and cried, when they get a diamond, they're like, "Yeah, bitch, give me more of them blood diamonds!
"Make them extra bloody".
Trust me.
We are here looking at a videotape.
This is back in April 2005.
We're looking at Councilman Dexhart Leslie, you should see this.
And he's now about to shake hands with Leslie Knope, the alleged sex toy.
Oh, for cripes sake!
Look at the way she's smiling at him.
Mmm-hmm.
And then almost unconsciously touching her hands to her hips.
See that?
Right there.
It's like she's sending him a message that she's ready for childbearing.
Wow.
In a the tiniest story gets dissected over and over again.
In 2004, a kid from Pawnee went to the Olympics, and it was reported on for over a year.
He wasn't even competing or anything, he just was going, literally, to watch the Olympics.
It was way too easy to get this guy here.
Councilman Dexhart, this has gone far enough.
I want you to hold a press conference and clear my name.
Mmm No, thanks.
Why not?
What's in it for you?
To be honest, being linked to Leslie is a lot less damning than the real story.
You're like a glass of whole milk.
What are you, Lutheran?
I love Lutherans.
Councilman, with all due respect, get a grip.
If you don't hold a press conference, I'm gonna come forward and tell the whole story.
It won't do you any good.
Take it from me, denying only makes things worse.
Listen, I gotta go.
I'm expected at two different maternity wards.
But before I go, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask.
Should we?
Oh, my God!
People already think we did it.
You've got nothing to lose.
I'm very good.
Get out of here!
All right, fine.
Shoeshine.
Shoeshine.
Oh!
Hey!
Hey.
I've been thinking about your gay boyfriend all day.
I have got some awesome ideas.
Okay.
First idea, spray tan gift certificates.
Ugh.
No.
Trip to Germany?
Germany is awesome.
And expensive.
Good call.
I didn't think of that.
Okay, you know how people say that you should give gifts that you would want to get yourself?
What would you want?
Easy.
Indianapolis Colts' Reggie Wayne jersey, number 87, double XL, home blue, signed by Reggie Wayne right after he catches a touchdown to win the Super Bowl.
Okay.
Never mind.
No?
Hip Hop Abs dance fitness DVD?
We just received these exclusive photos.
We have pictures of City Councilman Dexhart My God!
with Leslie Knope I cannot believe it!
The big issue now is, who is this mystery woman?
She and Knope are standing very close to each other, and any time you see two women standing very close to each other Oh, no.
No, don't say it.
you immediately assume Please don't say it.
lesbian.
Oh, of course.
What?
It is a veritable storm of information coming into the studios here today.
Hi, this is Leslie Knope, and I would like Joan to clear all of her guests tomorrow, because I'm coming on the show.
If you think that you can drag me and my friend through the mud, then you've got Yes, I'll hold.
Unbelievable.
Hey.
What happened?
Got a call from some panicky morning joggers.
Apparently, Sanitation didn't empty this dumpster.
To the raccoons' delight.
I thought raccoons were supposed to be nocturnal.
Not in this town, sweetheart.
In this town, they're 24/7.
We can't have raccoons for the Christmas thing.
They'll hunt the kids for sport.
Fess up, guys.
Who dropped the ball?
"Bring a case of beer to Sanitation".
"Bring a case of" Yeah, this one's our fault, Ron, and we will take care of this for you.
Okay, good, because I have to run a public forum, supervise the maintenance crews, and teach crafts at the senior center.
Simultaneously.
Joan, I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be on your show.
I'm really happy that I have the chance to clear my name.
Well, sure.
I see you brought your girlfriend for support.
That's nice.
What?
Oh, no.
She's not my And in five, Joan.
She's a We're Four.
Three.
You've got it wrong.
Sex.
Drugs, possibly.
Rock and Roll?
We'll find out, on Pawnee Today's exclusive interview with the woman at the center of the Dexhart sex scandal, Leslie Knope.
Leslie, my first question has to be, when did the affair start?
Joan, I spoke with Councilman Dexhart for the first time that night.
We met for about 15 minutes, and then I went home, alone, and that's the whole story.
Well, Leslie, we all saw the tape from four years ago, and you were flashing some serious "do me" eyes.
That's just my opinion.
I don't understand why I'm on trial here.
You should be grilling Councilman Dexhart.
You know what?
That's a really good idea.
Let's bring him out!
Councilman, come on out!
Hi, sweetie.
Why didn't you tell me he was gonna be here?
I thought it'd be more exciting!
You look great.
It's like I'm invisible.
Okay, my name is Ron.
You don't need to know my last name.
Whoever wants to talk, go ahead, and we'll be out of here in a tight 15.
I found a sandwich in one of your parks, and I want to know why it didn't have mayonnaise.
What's so funny?
Oh.
Yeah, I don't think kids should be allowed on the playground equipment.
Okay.
We've been over this.
If you're worried about swine flu, use hand sanitizer I'm not worried about swine flu.
I already have the swine flu.
I'm worried about the turtle flu.
The turtle flu?
Turtle flu.
Turtle flu.
Joan, this whole Pawnee Sun story is "gotcha journalism" at its worst.
Honey, let's just keep our private life in the bedroom where it belongs.
We do not have a private life!
Stop saying that we have a private life!
The fact is, we never slept together, and if we did, you would have proof, and we would have seen it by now.
Councilman?
I can prove it.
She has a mole on her right buttock.
What?
That is a total lie.
You've never seen my butt.
What are you talking about?
He has never seen my butt.
Well, I guess it's your word against his.
That's right.
Fine.
Here, Joan.
Why don't you look for yourself?
Is this happening?
Wait.
There's no mole.
There is no mole.
This exclusive story, there is no mole on Miss Knope!
I can't believe it's come to this.
This is utterly humiliating.
Well, Councilman?
Care to make a comment about No-Mole-Gate?
Yes.
I really didn't think that Miss Knope would pull down her pants on TV, but since she did, I will admit that the rumors of our affair are indeed false.
Thank you.
However, I have no plans to resign.
Oh, great.
Okay, Councilman.
You know what?
You're a class act.
Thank you.
I thought you did great.
When you get all feisty like that, it gets my heart racing.
Like I'm on a Stairmaster, except more, like, in a sexual Context.
I can't go to San Diego with you.
My life is here.
My friends, my career.
I guess I just thought with everything that happened, you'd want a fresh start.
I know.
I really care about you, Dave.
I just I love this town.
I'm sorry.
You want your ticket back?
No.
You know what?
Keep it.
You may want to come visit me, right?
There's a $75 change fee, but I could pay you that, or I could reimburse you.
There's a lot of ways we could handle that.
Oh!
Oh!
That's Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Hey!
Honey.
Honey, I'm so proud of you.
Leslie Knope!
That took guts, mooning Joan Callamezzo!
Aw!
Honey!
Thanks, Mom.
Oh, God!
Is something wrong with the tree?
No.
Nothing wrong.
But it's almost 9:00.
It should've been lighted up an hour ago.
We waited for you.
Okay, everybody.
Count down.
Five!
Four!
Five!
Four!
Three!
Two!
Three!
Two!
One!
Yeah!
One!
Yeah!
It's gotten a lot harder to work in government.
You think Winston Churchill ever had to pull his pants down and show his butt?
No.
But would he have?
Yes.
Now, could he have?
Well, maybe not towards the end of his life, but he would have.
Because he loved his job.
Reggie Wayne!
Dude!
You remembered me complaining about my computer bag!
Do you like it?
Yeah, it's perfect.
It's way better than the gift that I got you.
It's Pacers tickets.
Oh!
They're not even good seats!
Ugh.
This is awesome!
It's not awesome.
I actually got you a second gift.
You don't have to come to this game with me.
You don't have to.
That's the nicest gift anybody's ever Is that good?
Gotten me in my life!
Yes!
Is that good?
Come here.
Oh, thank God!
There's a bunch of messages waiting for you about a bunch of things I don't understand.
Hi, this is Leslie Knope in the Parks Department.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Leslie.
Potential problem.
The previous owner of Lot is claiming the government screwed them by illegally seizing the land.
I know about this issue.
I called the city attorney, like, 50 times.
He didn't call me back.
Oh, do you need a lawyer?
Because my friend Justin's a lawyer.
I'm sure he could help.
Oh, that'd be terrific.
Yeah.
I'll call him.
Justin's the greatest guy ever.
"The greatest guy ever"?
But does he dress this well?
Brooks Brothers.
Bought it right off the mannequin.
Ron Swanson?
That's me.
My name is George MacFayden.
I wanted to talk to you about the amount of snow in the parks.
I've been getting a lot of visitors recently, thanks to a stupid and worthless new push to make government officials more accessible to the public.
There is a disturbing lack of benches in Ramsett Park!
I want to sit more!
And another thing I like is the layout of the hiking trails.
I made this in one of your pottery classes.
It's terrible.
This is my hell.
Leslie?
Ann's friend, Justin.
Hey, yeah, of course!
Hi!
Thank you.
Thank you for coming in.
It's my pleasure.
Not a problem.
Have a seat.
I should warn you, land seizure isn't really my specialty, but I'm happy to take a look.
Any friend of Ann's Is a friend of mine!
That's my motto, too.
So, what is your specialty?
Is it locking up the bad guys or keeping them on the streets?
Neither.
Civil litigation, mostly.
That's interesting.
It can be.
I've got this crazy case Have you ever heard of this product Fire in a Can?
Ah, I love those commercials!
If you want to start a fire But you have to do it fast Well, you shouldn't buy it.
It'll literally burn your hand clean off.
Oh, wow.
Mmm-hmm.
It is an aerosol can with an igniter and a trigger.
It's essentially a blowtorch, and if you can believe it, it was invented to warm up baby bottles.
This is my colleague, Tom Haverford.
Tom.
Justin.
How are you?
You are wearing the hell out of that suit, sir.
Banana, two-button.
Let's go into the conference room.
I've got everything laid out.
Tom, stop.
We should talk later.
Wow, 12:15!
You're early today.
April, there's no paper in the printer.
So?
So that's the one thing you do.
Attention.
April, stop doing that.
Jerry told me to, so it's super crucial.
More important than that and more important than anything in this godforsaken world is finding me an assistant.
You get an assistant now?
Yeah, I've always been able to have one, but I've turned it down 'cause it's a waste of money.
In the eight years I've been at the job, I've saved the taxpayers of this city more than 150 grand.
But now, I need the taxpayers' money to save me from the taxpayers.
Post this at your college.
This looks like an ad for nothing.
Please be careful with it, it's my only copy.
You are very organized, Leslie.
Yeah, I am.
Thank you.
I love what you do.
You have the coolest job.
Let me guess.
This is our park.
I want to know everything about this.
Oh.
Okay.
Well, these green things represent trees.
I come in, like, two hours late because I had to finish watching Swimfan because it was on, and everyone, like, jumped down my throat.
Oh, man.
I can't wait till my internship is over so I can get the hell out of here.
Well, you're all set.
Free of charge, of course.
Hey, why don't you sell your band's CDs here?
That is a brilliant idea.
I cannot believe I didn't think of that.
I have been writing a lot of songs about shining shoes lately.
I tend to write about what I'm doing.
Talking about writing about what I'm doing Now I'm singing about talking about writing about what I'm doing Companies make bogus claims like this all the time.
I think you're gonna be just fine.
Thank you so much.
I know you're really busy.
Please, my pleasure.
At least this stuff is interesting, you know?
You know, it actually reminds me, two years ago, I was in Borneo officiating a wedding, and this enormous medicine man showed up and he was there to basically tell Justin!
Hey, kiddo!
How you doing?
Hey!
I'm good.
I haven't seen you in forever!
I know!
It's so good to see you.
You, too.
Do you want to grab some dinner?
Uh, I would love to.
I cannot.
I am swamped.
You're always so busy.
Yeah.
Next week, I promise.
Okay.
Hey, I'm Mark.
Sorry!
Hey, Mark.
Justin, this is Mark.
This is the city planner.
Oh, my God!
It's such a pleasure to meet you.
Pleasure.
Pleasure.
Anyway, Leslie, I have to go.
It has been a super pleasure meeting you.
I am gonna get into this over the weekend, and I will get back to you on Monday about it.
Okay.
Great.
All right.
See you, Justin!
Okay, Tom.
Good seeing you.
I've been thinking.
It has been a while since Dave left, and I think I might be ready to start dating again.
That's great!
Oh, my God!
I have so many ideas.
You know, I was only with Mark for one night, and then I was hung up on him for six years.
I dated Dave for three months, so if I continue that pattern, I won't be over him for Five hundred years.
What is your ideal man?
He has the brains of George Clooney in the body of Joe Biden.
Interesting.
Okay.
Just off the bat, there's a couple of doctors I think you would love.
What about Justin?
I mean, I feel like we kind of hit it off in there.
Yeah, I don't I have to think about that.
I don't I'm not sure that would work.
Really?
Is there something wrong with him?
No, no, he's really, really, really great, and you're so great, obviously.
I just I don't I don't know.
But I will find you someone, I promise, and he'll be awesome.
I'm gonna go do it right now.
Oh, good, great, yes!
Go, Ann, go!
Oh, just one rule.
I don't want to date a twin, 'cause I've been tricked before.
Okay.
Yes.
I understand your complaint.
I have to go now.
Please.
Thank you.
Ron Solo!
Hello, Tom.
I want to help you with your assistant search.
Why?
Just want to do my boy Ron a solid.
I know exactly what you're looking for, and I will find you a reliable person.
Now get out there and find me an assistant.
Okay.
I left you three messages.
Did you get them?
No, I've been running around all day.
What's up?
I found the perfect guy to set you up with, but he's going out of town, so he can only do tonight, so I came over here right after work.
Is that his blood?
What?
Oh, damn, now I have to go back.
Who is he?
His name is Chris and he's an MRI technician, and he's really cute, and he's very passionate about his job, and I told him all about you, and he's really interested.
So, dinner tonight, and here's the info.
Thanks!
Wait!
How's he gonna know it's me?
I'll wear a red rose in my hair.
No, I'll wear a giant red hat.
No, I don't have one of those.
What should I wear?
It's gotta be red.
I will just tell him what you look like.
Good call.
Hi.
I'm Leslie.
Are you Chris?
Yeah.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, don't worry about it.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Oh, here, let me take your coat.
Thanks.
Sure.
Well done, Ann.
I actually heard that.
What?
Well, I went to Wisconsin for both undergrad and grad school.
Go Badgers!
Boo!
Indiana Hoosiers!
No.
Badgers.
Oh.
It's not important.
I'm just glad that we could make this happen.
Ann kept going on about how wonderful you are, and I just had to see for myself.
Well, she's my number-one best friend.
I wish she'd told me that you went to Indiana, but whatever.
So, you're in charge of amusement parks, right?
God, that's exciting!
Actually, it's regular parks.
Like swings and slides and stuff.
Strike two.
You know, isn't it funny how these setups are always just so awkward?
Hey, watch this.
I will now extinguish this candle with my bare hand.
Okay.
That really hurt!
Are you okay?
Oh, God!
It looked so much easier on the Internet.
God, I gotta borrow some of your ice!
German?
Oh, my God.
All right, later.
Was that, uh, Justin?
Yes.
We are going to lunch tomorrow.
Great.
Did you guys ever date?
No.
We never did.
He's just, like, a really amazing person.
Awesome.
Let's do this!
Yes.
Marley and Me!
Let's do it.
Puppies, puppies, puppies!
I know.
Let's watch Marley and Me.
Brian.
Technically, you'd be assisting Ron, but Ron really doesn't do much government work, so you'd really be working for me.
I'm interested in real world expertise.
I got a nightclub opening to go to.
Which tie do I wear?
I like the one on the left.
That was a trick question.
The answer's this one.
Tell me about you.
Tell me about your friends.
Be as superficial as possible.
I meet a girl at a bar.
She seems kind of into me, could go either way.
I get her number, it's two days later, what do I text her?
"It was nice meeting you".
No, Zack!
I don't text her, "It was nice meeting you".
I wait eight weeks and I text her, "What's cracking"?
So, do you enjoy it, being an MRI technician?
Great question.
Someone steps into the room.
Imagine a mother of three, maybe she's a teacher.
She knows something's wrong, but she doesn't know what it is.
She's scared.
In less than an hour, I know what it is.
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
But the best part about being an MRI technician is, I can see inside everything.
See that guy over there?
Lmagine being able to look inside his head.
Wow.
I know.
You could look inside this steak or this butter or this bread.
You can look inside anything.
Well, if you look inside this bread, all you're gonna find is more bread.
I don't know.
I'd have to do an MRI.
Anyway, it's good that you found your calling.
I mean, I've never even had an MRI before.
What?
I don't know about this.
Well, I'm offering you a free scan.
It usually costs up to $2,000.
I'm kind of spoiling you here.
Well, I am a little curious.
Good.
Frankly, I don't want to invest in someone who only has three months to live.
Oh.
I'm just trying to think of this as an adventure, you know?
Just getting right back on that horse, even if that horse is crazy and wants to peer inside my body.
How's that feel?
Uh, weird.
Perfect.
Oh, you're not on your period, are you?
No.
Does that matter?
Well, not for this.
Okay.
It's gonna be a little crammed in there.
Don't worry, I'll be right on the other side of that glass.
Just your basic assistant stuff.
Taking messages, wake-up calls, Muscle Milk runs, condom runs, bottle service at the Snakehole Lounge.
That kind of stuff.
Sorry.
What do I get out of this?
Connections.
Plus 19 grand a year, minus my 10% headhunters' fee.
I have to pay you two grand if I get hired?
I have a job to offer.
In the immortal words of Rod Blagojevich, "It's a valuable thing.
You just don't give it away for nothing".
So you never told me where you're from.
I'm from Pawnee.
Keep still, please.
What kind of music do you like?
Can I answer that?
Sure.
Keep still.
All kinds.
Very important that you keep still at this moment, Leslie.
I've told you that a thousand times.
Did you ever break your arm?
You can answer that.
Here, I'll turn it off.
One time I was on my bike and some boys were making fun of me, so I chased them and I lost control.
I'm surprised you can see that.
It was, like, three years ago.
I can't believe I turned the machine off for that.
You never had any kids, right, Leslie?
No.
You've got a great oven.
Okay, time to go.
You got ample room in there.
Honestly, if you wanted to, you could go triplets right off the bat, Leslie.
You got a big, industrial-sized oven.
So we're done, right?
Sorry.
I gotta get that.
Hey!
How's the date going?
Good!
We just finished the MRI.
What?
Look, I know I said that I wanted to get back out there, but this guy is nuts.
Sorry, Les.
I'll find you somebody else, okay?
Just don't let this sour you on dating.
Yeah, okay.
Hey!
No cell phones!
What was that about?
I set Leslie up on a date.
I don't think it's going that well.
Oh, no.
With Justin?
Oh, no.
This guy I know from the hospital.
Why not Justin?
I don't really see them together.
You know?
Plus, Leslie just got out of a relationship, so I didn't want Justin to be, like, her rebound guy or anything, you know?
Yeah, that makes sense.
Leslie is a notoriously cruel and thoughtless person.
Why are we talking about this?
We're not.
You've got a large brain.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Well, it looks pretty Hang on.
That's weird.
What?
What's weird?
Your brain.
See that shadow right there?
Oh, my God!
What?
Is that bad?
I don't know.
I'd have a doctor look at that immediately if I were you.
Are you serious?
Oh, wait.
Oh.
It's, like, a smudge or something.
Crazy.
Thank God I was here.
Mark, I've never gone out with him.
I swear!
I'm sorry, but there's just something weird about the way you talk about him.
I don't know.
There was definitely times when we thought maybe we would go out someday.
That's why you didn't set Leslie up.
Because you're saving him.
No, I'm not.
Oh, yeah, you are.
Okay, fine.
You don't have someone in your life that you think, "I don't know, maybe if things were different, maybe, some day" You know what?
You can't save somebody for the future while you're in a relationship.
Even I know that.
Come on, don't go.
I'll talk to you later.
And by the way, the dog dies at the end.
So, did you want to go back to your place?
Yeah, actually, Chris, it was nice to meet you, but I think this is gonna be our last date.
I get it.
Get your MRI and get out, huh?
This was your idea.
Clever lady.
I guess I'm not as good a tech as I thought I was.
I should have noticed that you're missing a heart.
Ew.
Goodbye, Leslie.
Right.
I drove us here.
Goodie.
Hey, do you mind if we pick up my son Nate at his basketball game on the way back?
Wow!
This is really good.
"Cease and desist".
"Burden of proof".
Check out paragraph two.
I drop the F-bomb.
"Frivolous".
Definitely have the city attorney look at that, but that should be enough to do the trick.
Well, Justin, I just I can't thank you enough.
It's my pleasure.
Maybe I'll see you around sometime.
Yeah!
I would love Mmm-hmm.
I'll see you.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Damn!
He is all right.
Why don't you hit that?
Well, frankly, I would like to hit that, but Ann's being a little weird about it.
When you were dating Ann, did you know this guy Justin?
Oh, Justin?
I hate Justin.
Ann was so obviously into him.
It was so annoying.
Right.
I would say, in terms of guys that she's in love with, Justin's up here, I'm up here, and then you're down here.
Well, I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't crazy, so, naturally, I came to you for reassurance.
Do me a favor.
Don't tell Ann that we talked about this.
Will do.
Ann Perkins!
You should be ashamed of yourself.
What you're doing to Mark is not cool.
Why are you guys talking to each other?
You know what?
Forget it.
I'm not getting into this with you.
You did something wrong?
No!
I didn't do anything wrong.
Yeah.
Come here.
This is none of your business.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Actually, I do know what I'm talking about.
Every time I used to sit around all afternoon playing video games wearing only my slippers, all of a sudden, I would start to feel bad about myself, and do you know why?
Didn't you just explain why?
I would feel bad about myself because I would start to think about this perfect guy.
Anytime you would talk about Justin, I didn't feel very important.
That was rough.
Well, I didn't know that.
Maybe if you had, I wouldn't have left.
But you do know now, so you have to choose.
It's either me or Justin.
I'm not gonna choose.
Wait.
I'm dating Mark!
Are you, though?
Yes!
Ah!
That close.
Ronald, I've done it.
I've found your assistant, and he's dope.
His name is Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio!
Big T. What up?
Mr. Swanson, two things.
One, it is an absolute honor to meet you.
Two, who is that hot intern chick out there?
Because honestly, damn!
Take a seat.
Right.
Here we go.
So, Jean-Ralphio You got him right here.
Leave a message after the beep.
Why do I want you as my assistant?
For starters, access to the illest clubs.
And that's just for starters.
I will work for you.
I'll be on you 24I7.
I'll be like your family.
I'm here when you get here in the morning.
Sure enough, I'll be there tucking you into bed at night.
Don't worry, it's not gay.
Do we have questions?
I think our only question is, when can you start?
Right now, let's do it!
Thank you for coming in.
We will talk.
Cool.
I feel good about this.
And, you know, you can hit me up on Facebook anytime, day or night.
You know that, right?
Take care, buddy.
Boom.
So what do you think of your new assistant?
I want to punch you in the face so bad right now.
What?
Okay.
Message received.
I'll keep looking.
Thank you.
Bring me the opposite of him.
What kind of music is this?
It's rock and roll, my friend.
Fast, smooth, handsome rock.
That band is really blowing up right now.
They're number one on iTunes.
Okay.
I'll take one.
There's your change.
You are amazing!
I like when you hang out here.
I want to be your assistant.
Really?
You hate it here.
So do you.
I'll make sure you don't have to go to any meetings.
If anyone comes to see you, I'll scare them away.
Wait, April, if you had to choose between these two ties You're hired.
I just figured I might as well get paid for being here.
Hi.
Hey!
I was just calling you.
Here.
This is a prescription for Denise Dogan.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I'm so out of sorts.
Here.
Porter's Grill at 7:00.
Justin's gonna meet you there.
I'm sorry Chris was such a jerk.
You deserve way better than that.
If this situation is weird or if you feel weird It's not weird.
You guys will really like each other.
Thanks.
I gotta run.
I have another stop on the pride-swallowing tour of City Hall.
Go get him.
That's where I never find things.
Hey.
Hi, Ann.
So, I just set up Justin and Leslie.
And I'm sorry.
I rented District 9, if you maybe wanted to spoil that for me tonight.
Oh, my God!
Dark ending, right?
I'm back on the horse, and this horse is a lawyer, so I'm looking forward to riding him.
No, wait.
Ten months ago, she was an intern who could give a C- R-A-P about local government.
Now, she's our newest employee.
To April!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Yay!
Jerry, come and celebrate!
No, thanks.
Well, everybody, let's get back to work.
Where are you going?
I want to talk to Ron about the size of my desk.
Jerry, you have to schedule an appointment.
Okay.
How about now?
Ron's not here.
He's right there.
I can see him.
I'll let you know when he's available.
Attagirl.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
And it's because of you, our teachers, that every one of these recreation classes in this catalog shines like a jewel in Pawnee's beautiful crown.
Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, this year we will have to remove five jewels from that crown.
Excuse me?
Are you cutting our classes?
Yeah.
The city took away $1,000 from our budget.
So, I'm very sorry.
How will you decide which classes to cut?
By attendance and student evaluations.
So, just make sure your students leave with a smile.
My class is called "Coping with Terminal Illness".
Hopefully your attendance is good!
Actually, no, hopefully it's bad.
Nobody's more upset about this than me.
I've been taking these rec center classes since I was in high school.
It's where I learned hair braiding, and how to make biscuits, and French kissing.
The French kissing was just from a boy in my biscuits class, but either way, lesson learned.
Oh, my God!
You have never been to Carnival?
I want to go!
We have to get tickets in February to go to Rio de Janeiro, Leslie Knope.
Okay.
I am on a date with Justin in Indianapolis.
We've only been out a few times, but every one of them has been amazing.
Cheers.
Last time, we had a private tour and cocktails at the Indianapolis Aquarium.
That fish over there kind of reminds me of my mom.
Why?
It's just being really withholding.
Justin is definitely the most interesting guy I've ever dated.
All I did was a little paperwork.
He's being modest, it is thanks to him my family remains in this country.
And it was all pro bono.
Oh, Justin.
You've got to try this.
Oh, that's really good!
Isn't it great?
It's camel stomach.
Is it?
I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
It's chicken.
Would you like to try the camel stomach?
No.
This is me.
So, when am I gonna see you again?
Oh!
You know what, I'm gonna be near Pawnee on Tuesday.
Excellent, yeah.
I'll plan something exciting.
In fact, our date in Pawnee is gonna blow Indianapolis out of the water.
All right.
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Good!
You better.
I will!
I've racked my brain and I can't come up with one exciting idea.
I mean, he once ate fried cockatoo with a member of the Thai Royal Family.
Well, maybe just have him over and cook him some chicken and tell him it's Pawnee cockatoo.
A dinner party!
That's genius.
I'll invite all my most interesting friends over, we'll have this big rambling party.
No, I actually meant more like a one-on-one thing.
I know what you meant, but I took your idea and I made it better.
It's called a think tank, Ann.
What is?
Our lunches.
Our lunches are like think tanks.
Okay, I want you to come over to my house at 2:00 and help me get ready.
And make sure that Mark is coming.
So much work to do!
You're my best friend.
Now, get out of here!
How many courses will there be?
Three.
Hmm Four.
Not including dessert.
So, five courses.
Yes.
Now, it will be five courses.
If I wanted to bring a large number of deviled eggs, but I didn't want to share them with anyone else, can you guarantee fridge space?
Just be there at 8:00.
Oh, hey, Tom!
I'm having an A- list dinner party for Justin.
And you, out of all my friends, come from the most distant and exotic land.
South Carolina?
Save it for the party.
Can you make it?
For Justin?
Are you kidding?
I'm there.
Just don't invite any boring people like Jerry.
What are you guys talking about?
Nothing.
Don't worry about it.
What?
Leslie.
Hey!
Hey!
Check it out.
Just practicing.
Isn't that polish gonna get on people's butts when they sit down?
No.
Okay, listen.
I'm having a party Mmm-hmm.
And I thought maybe you could help me with serving and taking people's coats.
I'd pay you, like, 10 bucks an hour.
My guardian angel!
I would love to!
Who's going to be there?
Really fun people.
Ron, Tom, Mark and Ann.
That's great.
What's the occasion?
Justin is coming into town.
Hey, it's me, Justin.
Take my coat.
But please, be careful.
I got it from the king of Africa when we were walking on the Berlin Wall together.
Really, Justin?
What instruments do you play?
Actually, he's a pretty sick keyboardist.
Good.
I'm good to go.
That sounds great.
Great.
All right.
I'll see you there.
Afternoon, Andy.
Hi, Kyle.
You know, right before you sat down, I noticed, did you have some kind of stain on your ass, or something?
What was that?
What?
No, no, no.
You're good.
Hey, Ann.
Hey!
Welcome to my house, for the very first time.
I know!
I can't believe you've never had me over.
Now, I can believe it.
I know, I know.
It's a little messy.
But I have a system.
So, I just need you to help me put the finishing touches on everything.
This newspaper's from November, 1986.
Oh, the first rumblings of Iran-Contra!
Don't throw that out!
I think I need to call Child Services and have Leslie taken away from herself.
Leslie, don't take this the wrong way, but your house is like a crazy person's garage.
What do you need this birdhouse for?
Can we get rid of it?
I might need it.
What about this one?
Well, if two birds come along?
Leslie.
Andy's gonna come over soon, he can help us with all this stuff.
Andy?
No.
No, no, no.
You need a team of professionals to help.
I have an idea.
Hi, is this Maria Portlesman from "Organize Your Life, with Maria Portlesman"?
April, come here.
What?
Shake my hand.
Why?
I can't tell if I've exfoliated too much.
I don't want to creep Justin out.
I want him to respect my handshake.
Why do you care about him?
Justin is hip.
Pawnee is the opposite of hip.
People in this town are just now getting into Nirvana.
I don't have the heart to tell them what's going to happen to Kurt Cobain in 1994.
Hey, Justin.
Ew!
It's like touching raw chicken.
Damn it.
Gonna have to re-foliate them.
I'll need some help moving the boxes, but it's doable.
Oh, thank God.
How much do I owe you?
Please.
No charge.
I just appreciate the chance to demonstrate how valuable my class is to the rec center.
And I hope you'll keep that in mind.
Oh!
No, no, I insist on paying.
No, no, I insist on demonstrating.
This is not gonna affect my decision at all.
Oh, of course not.
Stop winking.
Hey, Leslie, I forgot to ask you.
What are you cooking?
Five courses.
Of what?
Huh?
Of what?
Oh, God.
So, how's it looking?
It smells great.
Okay, the appetizers are almost ready.
And I think that they are a very good sampling of what my level one class does, which I hope you'll keep in mind when you're making your decisions.
Tania, like I said over the phone I know.
It won't influence your decision.
It's just that learning to cook is very important in this day and age.
Is it?
Hey, Andy.
Hey!
Are you gonna be all right, tonight?
What, 'cause of Mark and Justin?
They are just guests at a really awesome dinner party.
And I will treat them as such.
That sounds very professional.
Thank you.
I promise I will not spit in anyone's food, unless they should request that I do.
Good.
Did I do this right?
I don't know.
Hey, Mark.
Hey.
Welcome to my humble abode.
Well, thank you.
Whoa!
This is way cleaner than the last time I was here.
You've been here?
Right.
When was Mark here before?
Oh!
Sex.
I can't wait to talk to Justin again.
Last time he told me about how he snorkeled with whale sharks in Madagascar.
That was after I told him that I sometimes go swimming at the Y. Oh, thank you, son.
Leslie Knope.
I believe you've arranged accommodations for these.
Yes, I have.
Hey, Ron Swanson.
You didn't happen to hear about the incident with Mayor Gunderson's dog, did you?
Oh, my God.
It was a blood bath No, no, no!
No talking.
Everybody stop talking until Justin gets here.
Don't use up your stories.
Well, I think somebody from Animal Services is gonna get canned.
Oh, my God.
What part of not talking do you not understand?
Please, have a good time and shut your mouth.
I just want this dinner party to go well.
There are very few things I've asked for in this world.
To build a new park from scratch.
To eventually become president.
And to one day solve a murder on a train.
I think it's fair to add this to the list.
Guys, Justin's here!
That's Justin.
Everybody start talking.
Hey!
Hey.
Hi.
Sorry I'm a little bit late.
That's okay.
Welcome to my very interesting party.
Andy Dwyer!
Can't wait to catch up with this guy.
All right, Justin.
May I take your coat, sir?
Why, yeah.
Thank you.
I can't wait, I'm gonna get to hang out with all your friends tonight.
I know, it's gonna be super fun.
It's gonna be a blast.
Really, really, just like the best, most exciting night of your life.
I cannot over-hype it enough.
All right.
Let's get started!
Okay!
Good.
Yeah.
What's up, J?
How you doing, man?
How are you?
Justin.
I have the swine flu.
Oh No, she doesn't.
Yo.
Yo.
Is that Justin's coat?
Oh, yeah.
Isn't it awesome?
He got it in Cambodia, when he was hiking Mount Everest.
Let's put chewed up gum in his pockets.
That's genius.
But I can't.
Leslie's being super cool to me, and I can't screw over her boyfriend's jacket.
I'll do it when you're not in the room then.
That would be terrible.
I'm being sarcastic.
That would be awesome.
God, India is so amazing.
Let me tell you something.
That is my absolute favorite place to travel.
Where did you say your parents were from?
The south part.
The southern part's always the best part of anything.
Have you ever been to the Kaniman Mosque, down in Tamil Nadu?
Are you kidding?
My uncle practically runs the place.
I've prayed there.
It's sick.
Tell me everything, right now.
One sec, I just got to hit the loo, as those bastard British lmperialists would say.
The last time I was in India, I was eight years old and I stayed inside the whole time playing video games.
I got to bone up.
Fourth largest coal reserves in the world.
This is the best Old Fashioned I have ever had.
Where'd you find this bartender?
Oh I think I don't know.
Like, maybe the Yellow Pages.
There's no way that you're paying him enough.
Well, if you want, I could teach you the secret to great Leslie.
Ann, get over here!
I'm here.
Already.
Good.
Okay, do you think this party's going well?
I mean, can you see Justin?
Is he having fun?
Justin is over there talking to Mark.
Happily.
Okay, good.
Yeah, good.
I'm just gonna casually make my So my face is literally on fire, but it's this weird chemical, so no one can see the flames.
I'm dancing around, freaking out.
I end up having to dunk my face into a bucket of sand.
Unreal!
Unreal!
Oh, my God, that is unbelievable.
Oh, my God, that's Isn't it, Ann?
Unbelievable.
Didn't happen to me.
It was a kid I knew from camp.
But a great story's a great story.
Well, plus, the kid can't tell it, his mouth melted.
Dinner is served!
Oh!
Excellent!
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Are we late?
What the hell are you doing?
How could you invite Wendy when Ron's here?
He's gonna wrap her up in his moustache and take her home.
We agreed that we should invite interesting people for Justin, and Wendy is an interesting person!
I've been telling you for weeks that you should tell her how you feel.
Now's your chance!
Oh, yeah.
That makes sense.
No, it doesn't!
Not cool, at all!
He'll get over it.
No, I won't.
The first course is a Mexican bean soup.
Are these peppers for consuming?
I wouldn't.
They're very hot.
I'm gonna give it a try.
Hot.
You're very brave.
Please, that was one of the tiny ones.
This is how you eat it!
Don't do that, Tom!
This is something, Justin.
Derek and Ben are gay, but often, on occasion, April will have relations with Derek.
Right?
Crazy stuff.
Discuss that.
There's not much more to discuss.
You kind of explained it all.
Who else is gay?
Tom, I need your help.
There was a lull.
I saw Justin yawn.
Please tell me that yawning is a sign of excitement in India or something.
Tom, focus!
God, you're no help.
Yes, just to be clear, this will in no way influence me.
It won't affect my decision.
And it has no bearing on the future of your class.
Hey, little buddy!
Everything okay?
That took a long time.
Poor Tommy.
He has a very frail colon.
I feel your pain, brother.
The hottest thing I ever put into my mouth was in this remote village in Southern Brazil.
This sounds good.
Yeah.
They take a little bit of scorpion poison and they serve I wonder who that is.
Who could that be?
More people?
A belly dancer?
What?
It's weird, but she just showed up.
I mean, I'm not the kind of person that's gonna throw someone out, or, you know, not let them in if they randomly show up.
I don't know how they all got here.
You know, people hear about a killer party at Knope's house, they all come running.
You don't do origami every day, do ya?
They brought in a little entertainment, thank God.
That Justin, he's so boring.
What are you talking about?
He's incredible.
Yeah.
He's not gay, but if he were, I would totally break up with Ben for him.
Yeah, I would understand.
He's amazing, right, April?
Right, April?
Don't we love him?
Yeah.
He's actually kind of awesome.
You're underage.
I could lose my liquor license, I'm sorry.
Andy.
Hey.
Are you having fun?
All I can say is, this is not what I was expecting.
I cannot believe there's more.
There's not.
Miss Knopes, I understand that you're currently evaluating the rec center teachers.
You're doing what, Leslie?
I demand an evaluation.
Okay.
What course do you teach?
When it comes to choosing accounting software, there's no accounting for taste.
The advantage of QuickBooks Pro is that it's easy to assemble a list of vendors Well, this is great.
I'm heading home, so as not to have to be here anymore.
My office, first thing tomorrow.
Yeah, I think we're probably gonna take off, too.
The demonstration takes another 45 minutes.
Yeah, guys, please.
Everybody, can you just stay?
Okay?
Justin, would you Oh, my God.
I promise you, Miss Knope, this disciplinary committee will go over every detail of what happened last night.
And we will determine whether you are guilty of abusing your power.
Do you have anything to say before we begin?
Just that I am looking forward to the truth coming out.
I would like to say that Leslie is incapable of using people for her own gain.
Thank you, Tom.
But I can't, because Leslie loves using people for her own gain.
If I may, Phil, I'd like to say something to Tom on the record.
This has all been on the record.
I'm very sorry that I invited Wendy to the party.
Is Wendy one of the teachers?
No, she's my soon-to-be ex-wife.
And hopefully-then-to-be future-wife.
Look, I'm really sorry.
I put a new romance in front of an old friendship.
Okay.
I put a beautiful man in front of an adorable man-child.
You're ruining it.
I put a big white stallion in front of a little brown pony.
Totally uncalled for.
Ron Swanson will be next.
When it comes to government hearings, the only type of witness I enjoy being is a hostile one.
That's why I intend to answer every one of their questions with a question.
Were you aware that all of the entertainment and food was provided by rec center teachers?
Would I have stayed if I knew that?
I don't know, would you have?
Would you have?
No.
I wouldn't have.
Did you hear Leslie make any promises?
What constitutes a promise?
A quid pro quo.
Oh!
Do you know Latin?
Okay.
Thank you, Ron.
Are we done?
Can I get a shine?
Oh.
No.
I'm sorry.
We're closed, due to betrayment.
Well, I'm sorry.
But I don't know what you're talking about.
Why don't you ask your new best friend, whose name is Justin.
Justin?
Yes.
I would.
But he's probably too busy cleaning gum out of his coat pockets.
Wow.
Unbetrayed.
So, you don't work for the government and you had no idea that these people were teachers from the local rec center?
No.
I was simply attending a dinner party at my friend's house.
Why is he here, Miss Knope?
That will become clear.
Mr. Anderson, could you please describe that evening?
Well, I had a very pleasant time.
And from my perspective, there was no abuse of power with respect to Miss Knope and any of her various guests.
Could you define pleasant?
Did you have a good time?
Did you have a great time?
Be specific, and do remember that you're under oath.
I had an amazing time.
But you fell asleep.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
You know, look, I'd been given a case the night before, so I had to stay up all night working on it and I didn't want to cancel.
You should've told me.
I would've rescheduled.
Are you kidding me?
I was looking forward to it.
I had an awesome time which had nothing to do with the rec center teachers.
No further questions.
Okay.
We're going to take a break, and we'll let you know what we decide in about an hour.
Great.
I will see you later.
I'm in the middle of official business, so I can't talk about it right now.
Okay.
Okay.
But, yes, yes, you will.
So, did you get that?
He said amazing and awesome.
So, I'm gonna drive up and see him next weekend.
There's some Kabuki theater festival happening.
Great.
You're so relaxed.
You're not freaking out about this at all?
Okay, Leslie.
We've reached our decision.
We're not going to take any further action at this time.
Thank you.
It really helped that you asked for this hearing yourself.
And that you made financial restitution out of your own pocket.
But I think we both know you skirted a line here.
You turned yourself in?
Why?
Well, I did something wrong, and I felt bad.
So, this morning I donated $1,000 to the rec center, so everybody could keep teaching their classes.
Okay, so why did you ask for the hearing?
Are you kidding, Ann?
It's every girl's dream to ask a dude how their date went under penalty of perjury.
I'm not proud of my actions.
But the most important thing is, there is now an official government document that proves my dinner party kicked ass.
Tommy Hav.
J Train!
What's up, brother?
This might be none of my business, but you need to ask Wendy out.
For reals, this time.
Did Leslie tell you No.
She didn't need to.
I saw it.
I'm not gay, but you're the most incredible man I've ever met.
That doesn't sound gay at all.
See you around.
Take care.
Bye, brother.
You sure you don't want to come hang out for a minute?
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Hi, I'm Tom Haverford.
I work at the Parks Department.
It's a little douchie.
Good call, J. I'm getting divorced, so I'm trying to up my game.
Who am I supposed to ask for fashion advice?
Jerry?
He wears the same soup-stained khakis every day.
Justin's my savior.
He's like an issue of GQ that's come to life.
Tommy Timberlake.
You look like Encyclopedia Brown.
Sequins!
Try it without the gloves.
Sequins, minus the gloves.
Hey, what's up?
I'm Tom.
Is my shirt lighting up?
'Cause I didn't even notice.
All right, guys.
Let's talk accessories.
Be honest.
Which cane do you like better?
Dragon?
Serpent?
Dragon?
Serpent?
Belt buckle, says, "What's cracking"?
I can have it say whatever I want.
It can say, "What's cracking?
I'm Tom.
"What's cracking, girl?
What's cracking, boo"?
Eagle medallion!
Well, as far as white, leather suits go It's horrible.
I like it.
Sweetums has been Pawnee's leading sweet-treat manufacturer for over 80 years.
And we are so excited about our new partnership with the Parks Department.
Starting next month, Sweetums is gonna take over the concession stands in our parks.
I mean, I don't love the idea of corporate sponsorship, but Sweetums is an institution.
When you think of Pawnee, you think of Sweetums.
Although candy is our bread and butter, we also care about the health of our customers.
And that's why we'll be debuting our new healthy energy bar, NutriYums.
Take a look.
Hi, I'm Nick Newport, Jr., CEO of Sweetums.
And I'd like to introduce to you our new line of energy bars, NutriYums.
We start with then we add just a little bit of Sweetums corn syrup, a little drop of sunshine, and some other stuff.
And since they're from Sweetums, you know your kids are gonna love them.
Wow, that family looks so healthy.
Look at them.
They're all wearing vests!
Dakota?
Denver?
Sorry, Shoelace.
We don't make NutriYums for dogs.
Yet.
Shoelace.
NutriYums.
Where nutritious meets tasty.
By Sweetums.
If you can't beat them Sweetums!
Sweetums!
I could not be happier about this.
I think the entire government should be privatized.
Chuck E. Cheese could run the parks.
Everything operated by tokens.
Drop in a token, go on the swing set.
Drop in another token, take a walk.
Drop in a token, look at a duck.
Brendanawicz!
Quick question, do you personally know Xzibit?
Because I was checking out that pickup truck of yours, and that ride is pimped!
It's really nice of you to compliment my pickup truck with no ulterior motives.
Yeah, so, listen, I need to move some stuff this weekend into my new bachelor pad, since my divorce is finally going down.
Just some odds and ends.
You can bring up the Mark-mobile, help me move, right?
I'm totally blanking on a valid excuse right now, so, yes.
I'll help you.
My boy!
I hate having a pickup truck.
Andy, I have a very interesting business proposal for you.
I'm moving a lot of heavy stuff out of my place this weekend.
Can I help you move?
I'm really good at it.
Afterwards, I'll take the cardboard from the boxes and use it for break dancing.
I'll go, too.
Really?
'Cause an hour ago you told me you'd rather watch a sex tape of your grandparents.
Shut up.
I don't have anything else to do.
Do you want help or not?
All right.
See you guys later.
I think that that's really, really sweet, that your grandparents still make love.
Ready to go?
Yes.
Your keys, please.
You gotta be kidding me.
I'm fine.
Well, we'll let the chart be the judge of that.
What are you, 5'11", 210 pounds, three whiskeys?
Looks like you are just over the line into impaired.
You carry that with you all the time?
It comes in handy.
And on the back, it teaches you how to play blackjack.
Swansons have a preternaturally high tolerance for alcohol.
My old man used to put Wild Turkey on his Corn Flakes.
I'm not gonna argue with you, Ron.
We're just gonna sit and wait until, you know, you're safe to drive, which would be in about one hour.
"Insurance is a side bet when you wager half of your original bet "because you believe the dealer has a 10 in the hole".
Get off my car, woman!
Twenty minutes.
The dealer really has an advantage.
That's what I get the most from this.
Hey, Ron.
Morning, Leslie.
Did you have a good night?
I did.
I watched a really good What is that?
This is what I did last night.
After I got home, I drank six more glasses of whiskey and then I finished crafting this small harp, using a band saw, a spoke shave and an oscillating spindle sander.
Beautiful.
But wait, there's more.
Here are some photographs of me drinking the whiskey.
You'll notice I'm holding up yesterday's newspaper, so you can tell that I'm not lying.
I feel like I'm in a spa.
So, I got my truck all cleaned out and ready to go for tomorrow.
Do you have, like, furniture pads and dollies?
That sort of thing?
Ooh, I thought the mover supplied those.
I'm not a mover!
I'm a sap who owns a truck.
Don't talk about yourself like that.
And bring some coffee.
Hey, are you moving out?
Have you told Wendy how you feel yet?
Waiting for the right time.
It's right now.
The time is now.
Just don't worry about it.
I'm fine.
Hmm.
What's that over there?
Mmm!
Holy cow.
Yeah.
Wow.
That is good stuff.
Great, right?
Oh, my God.
They're amazing.
They're more than amazing.
They are terrific.
Terrific's not more than amazing, Jerry.
No?
Well, it's not less.
Everything Sweetums makes is off the charts.
I like their candy fingernails.
I can't believe these things are healthy.
It's not that crazy.
Krackel bars, also healthy and delicious.
No, they're not.
Yeah.
They actually have rice in them.
So Andy, you're fine, but you're simple.
Who just put 100 of these in their body?
Ann!
Oh!
Look at you!
You're looking pretty unhealthy today.
You might need one of these, NutriYum, by Sweetums.
If you can't beat them, Sweetums!
I love that song.
Ow!
I need to go check my e-mail.
We're gonna sell these in the park now.
They're healthy!
Holy God.
No, they're not, they're terrible for you.
No, they're not.
There's a picture of Lance Armstrong on there.
Yeah, but look at the ingredients.
"High-fructose corn syrup, corn syrup".
There's only eight grams of fat.
Yeah.
Per serving.
A bar is four servings.
Well, people seem to enjoy them.
Look how happy everybody is.
Yeah, that's a sugar rush.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That makes sense.
They're gonna crash soon, and it's not gonna be pretty.
Yeah, I'm gonna crash soon, too.
'Cause I've eaten, like, 40 of these.
Oh, God!
Generally, I like to stay out of other people's business.
But Pawnee is the fourth most obese city in America.
The kids here are beefy.
They're just husky, big-boned, plus-sized chunk monsters.
I call them like I see them.
Leslie?
Yeah?
Let's get some almonds in you, okay?
Okay.
Get it.
I can't open them.
Back to work.
I hate it here.
This place is evil.
I think these are the only two films that say "Sweetums" on the label.
Yeah, well, let's take them both.
We might find something interesting.
Here, just let me stick them under my shirt.
No.
Just walk out.
They have sensors!
Just check them out.
It's free.
Hey, Marci.
Leslie.
Are they finally teaching you Parks people how to read?
Oh, I guess not.
It's a movie.
You're pretty cocky for someone whose job is obsolete because of the Internet.
Let's see.
Hmm.
You seem to have a $40 late fee on a book called Mysteries of the Female Orgasm.
No, I don't.
Yeah, you do.
Ann, grab the movie!
Go, go, go, go!
Punk-ass book jockeys!
So, you guys all good with the Sweetums concession-stand deal?
I can go ahead and sign off on it?
You betcha.
Actually, no.
No.
We are worried that the energy bars that they're gonna sell are grossly unhealthy and they're misleading people about what's actually in them.
No, we're not worried about that.
We're fine and we sign off.
Paul, can I have a sidebar with Ron?
I guess.
Sidebar, Ron.
I did some research, and NutriYums are terrible for you.
I don't care.
We're doing it.
That's a We're in a sidebar.
Do you not care about your city's health?
I care about the people's right to consume whatever they want.
Paul, can you and I have a sidebar?
No.
Okay.
I think maybe we should hold a public forum.
That way we won't be liable.
There's no point.
It's a home run for the city.
No, I think she's right.
It's a good cover-our-ass move.
Let's do it.
Paul!
Leslie, why must you stick your nose into everyone else's business?
Sidebar, Paul.
Ron's upset because I didn't let him drive last night.
Stop sidebarring.
Somebody's grouchy.
You said it was just odds and ends.
It is, yeah.
And some furniture.
And the plasma TV.
You haven't even folded up the boxes yet.
Dude, Deep Blue Sea.
Greatest movie ever made.
That's the Canadian version, and there's a bonus audio track where LL Cool J raps all his dialog.
What?
We're watching this right now.
Yes!
Pop it in!
No, no, no!
We should really pack this room up and get moving.
So, this is a really big room I need packed up, guys.
This is your bedroom?
No, it's a spare room I converted into a walk-in closet lhome fitness center.
What is that?
Oh.
I strapped an MP3 player to one of those floor cleaning robots.
I call him "DJ Roomba.
" Little guy cruises around and plays music.
What's hot, DJ Roomba?
DJ Roomba, tearing it up!
He likes me.
Let's dance for a little while, Mark.
What NutriYums energy bars are just absolutely loaded with high-fructose corn syrup and fatty oils.
And any way you slice it, they're just extremely unhealthy for you.
Leslie needs to butt out.
The whole point of this country is, if you want to eat garbage, balloon up to 600 pounds and die of a heart attack at 43, you can.
You are free to do so.
To me, that's beautiful.
Any questions?
If sugar is so bad, how come Jesus made it taste so good?
Yes?
But isn't all food bad for you?
I've been eating lasagna and muffins every day of my life for 40 years and I feel terrible.
Right.
What's so bad about corn syrup?
It's natural.
Corn's a fruit.
Syrup comes from a bush.
Oh, boy.
How do we know you're really a nurse?
I am, I promise.
I work at Saint Joe's.
Well, the point is, my friend thinks you're cute.
Give me your number so he can have it.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
Can I have your e- mail address?
Oh, my God.
I just got on AOL.
No!
I think we ought to throw those bars out and eat ham-and-mayonnaise sandwiches.
That's not a good idea.
Ham and mayonnaise!
That's not No.
Ham and mayonnaise!
No, no, no, no.
Ham and mayonnaise!
Ham and mayonnaise!
Ham and mayonnaise!
Oh, God.
I can't believe you do this every week.
I'm actually encouraged.
The questions were more relevant than usual.
Yeah.
I need to order the brown Timberlands in a size eight, narrow.
How much is the next-day shipping?
And, what's two-day shipping?
Yeah, I'd like to place an order for one pad thai, chicken, and no scallions on it, please.
Just for one person, yeah.
Just one.
Yeah, I saw Mark carrying, like, three boxes.
That dude is strong.
Whatever.
I'll carry five boxes!
Go get 'em, champ!
Okay, Donna.
Where do you want this?
Uh-uh.
That's it.
My baby has a delicate suspension.
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm not.
Move.
Put it in your truck, Brendanawicz.
There's plenty of room.
Hey!
Ah!
My pocket squares!
Sorry, Shoelace.
We don't make NutriYums for dogs.
Yet.
NutriYums.
Where nutritious meets tasty.
By Sweetums.
I guess that about says it all.
You know, it doesn't, actually.
I think we should watch another video right now, one that your company made 30 years ago.
I'm Nick Newport, president of Sweetums, giving you a look inside our corn syrup factory.
This is all-new, high-fructose corn syrup, a miracle product that's sweeter than sugar, but cheaper to produce!
Cheap, delicious, sugary corn is currently being used by farms to fatten up their cows and pigs.
Look how fat those cows are!
Fat, happy and docile, the way we like them.
So, you still want to claim that corn syrup is healthy?
Corn syrup is natural, and it's fine in moderation.
But don't take my word for it.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Nick Newport, Jr!
All right!
What's going on?
Yeah!
How you doing?
Yeah!
Yeah!
That's what I'm saying!
My kids, Denver and Dakota!
Come on down, guys!
I just wanna get That's good hose water.
Don't get my shoes.
Hey, what's up, guys?
You come to help Tom move, too?
Too late!
We already almost got all of it.
No, we just thought it'd be funny to see April doing physical labor.
It's been an awesome moving day.
I got the little robot to play Dave Matthews.
Little baby!
What's he talking about?
DJ Roomba.
What?
All right.
Back to the grindstone.
Awesome seeing you, dudes.
See you.
Later, bro.
Hi.
Hi.
God, this is so weird.
It's, like, end of an era, huh?
It's kind of sad.
Yeah, we'll still be friends.
Yeah.
Well, hey, you guys must be starving.
You want me to order you pizza or something?
Oh, that'd be great, yeah.
Okay.
Why don't you get some Canadian bacon on it, since you're from Canada.
Mmm-hmm.
And sausage, 'cause I am brown and spicy.
Okay, all right.
Well, I will see you around, I guess.
Yeah.
Right?
I'm around.
I'll see you around.
Bye.
Bye.
Wow.
Mr. Newport, Jr. , thank you so much for coming.
But don't you think that every person has a right to know what they're putting in their bodies?
Right, everybody?
Is Shoelace here?
Where's Shoelace?
Shoelace couldn't make it.
Aw!
But I do agree with this nice lady.
That's why I say we should let the people be the judge.
Denver?
Everybody!
Check under your seats!
Look, look!
I got chocolate!
Denver, you little son of a bitch.
Mmm.
There's no pizza left?
Sorry, Jer.
Too slow.
Do you want my crusts?
Here, take this.
Nobody even told me the pizza was here.
Jerry!
You stepped on DJ Roomba!
That was an accident.
You killed him!
I built him myself.
He was like a son to me.
Okay.
Time to vote.
All those who would like the bloated corpse of the government to keep running the snack bars at taxpayer expense, raise your hands.
That seems like an unfair phrasing.
And all those in favor of letting this heartless corporation, Sweetums, stuff your children with sugary crap, raise your hand.
Thank you, everybody.
I can't believe this.
You know what?
We did our job.
We informed the public.
That's all we can do.
I'm sorry, man.
There's nothing we can do.
Are you serious?
Look, we'll get it fixed and I'll see you Monday.
I just got off the phone with my new landlord.
Apparently, there's been some sort of gas leak and I can't move into my place until Monday now.
Are you telling us we have to unload this and move it back in the house?
No, I can't put it there.
I promised Wendy I'd be out of here tonight.
I got it.
Everybody go home, pack away my stuff in your own houses.
Then on Monday, pack it back up, meet me at my new place, unload it there.
Come on, guys.
See you, Tom.
Bye.
Later.
Hey, bro, wanna go get our grub on?
Totes, bro.
Wings and brews!
Why are you guys talking like that?
Just chillaxin' like your new bro, Andy.
Yeah.
Wanna play some Hacky Sack later, maybe listen to Blues Traveler?
Okay.
I'm leaving.
We're just kidding.
Let's go to dinner.
I'm not hungry.
And you guys aren't being funny.
Why are you being weird?
We make fun of people like that.
That's what we do.
You know, for a gay couple, you guys are being really gay.
I said, "Of course I remember you.
You're Chastity, right"?
Leslie!
Even though I didn't invite you, you came here anyway.
I respect that, because you made a choice as a free American.
What are you eating?
I call this "turf and turf".
It's a 16-ounce T-bone and a 24-ounce porterhouse.
Also, whiskey and a cigar.
I'm gonna consume all of this at the same time because I am a free American.
No cigars inside, sir.
Fine.
I will smoke the entire thing outside.
Even though it is bad for me, I am going to do it.
Why is he being such an ass?
It's a long story.
It's freezing outside, so I will not be smoking this cigar.
But rest assured, I could if I wanted to, because this This is America, right?
Is it?
May I speak with you, please?
Look, I don't know if you're being a jerk on purpose just to prove you have the right to be a jerk, but either way, you're being a jerk.
So, here.
Take the booze chart.
Are you kidding me?
No.
If you're gonna drink, you should use it, okay?
I'm gonna head out.
By the way, maybe it's none of my business, but if you eat three pounds of steak every day, you're gonna die, and although I've already written your eulogy, and it's incredibly touching, I would prefer not to give it for a while.
The first line, by the way?
"O Captain!
My Captain!
Ron Swanson, a swan song".
Yeah, and it gets better from there.
April!
April!
You wanna watch me rollerblade in the parking lot after work?
I'm pretty awesome.
I used to be really good.
That was, like, 70 pounds ago.
I can't.
I'm kind of busy.
Oh, that's lame.
Tomorrow?
Maybe.
I don't know.
Okay.
Bye.
Just kidding!
I don't fall!
I What are you eating?
I didn't have time to have breakfast.
I'm gonna toss these in the dumpster outside.
And I don't wanna see you digging around in there later.
I am sorry.
I have been a horse's ass.
And that is the end of what I have to say.
Apology accepted.
Put a coat on.
It's freezing outside.
Jerry!
Jerry!
This is the ghost of DJ Roomba.
Why did you kill me?
I'm gonna haunt you, Jerry.
I'm gonna follow you and play the Black Eyed Peas on a non-stop loop!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
If you look inside your bags, you will find a few things.
A bouquet of hand-crocheted flower pens Oh!
A mosaic portrait of each of you made from the crushed bottles of your favorite diet soda, and a personalized of why you are all so awesome.
What's Galentine's Day?
Oh, it's only the best day of the year.
Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home and we just come and kick it breakfast style.
Ladies celebrating ladies.
It's like Lilith Fair minus the angst.
Plus frittatas.
So to conclude our Galentine's Day breakfast, it is time for the greatest story ever told.
What's the story?
It's the most romantic story ever.
It makes The Notebook look like Saw V. Go, Mom, go.
It was 1968.
I was 18 and our family went on a vacation to Bermuda.
And on the first day, I went for a swim in the ocean.
And I got caught in a very strong current.
You've heard this story before, right?
Yes, but the drama.
The next thing I felt were two very powerful arms whisking me to safety.
And he looked down at me and he said, "Are you okay"?
And I looked up at him and I said, "I am now".
So they sneak out to meet each other and walk on the beach.
And two weeks later, he asked her to marry him and move to Illinois.
But her parents thought she was too young, so she said no.
And then they lost touch, and a few years later she met my dad.
I gotta take one of those lifeguard courses.
Those guys get all the action.
Am I right, Justin?
We gotta find this guy.
Frank?
He's probably married or dead.
What's the difference?
Am I right, Justin?
Well, at least let me try and find him.
Imagine how much better that story would be if we actually reunited them?
I think Justin's right.
You should let him do this.
Okay.
Do it.
But if you find him and he's weird, like a ventriloquist, or a puppeteer, or anyone who pretends toys are people, then abort the mission.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
You, you're the best girlfriend ever.
Aw!
Happy Valentine's Day.
I knew, eventually, somehow, being in a relationship with you would totally pay off.
I bought him some actual towels.
He was using a bathrobe.
And I bought him some other things that humans usually use, like shampoo.
Troops, gather around.
Great news.
The Senior Center Valentine's Dance is tomorrow, from 5:00 to 9:00.
Are we talking a.m. or p. m?
Those people are old.
Am I right, Justin?
Oh!
Justin's not here.
It isn't just a job, gang, we're gonna learn a lot from these seniors.
Some of them have been married for half a century.
And no offense, but everybody here is terrible at love.
Divorced, dating a gay guy, divorced twice, jury's still out on you two.
And Jerry, who knows.
I've been happily married for 28 years.
You've met my wife, Gayle, many times.
Whatever.
Finally, Ann and Mark are our special volunteers, and they will be available whenever needed.
I didn't volunteer.
Yeah, too bad.
You got drafted.
Ask not what your old people could do for you, ask what you could do for your old people.
Terminator.
What?
No, JFK.
This meeting has been terminated.
That is the Terminator.
Nice.
Where am I going?
Well, hello there.
Well, hey.
I got your message.
You wanted to talk?
Yes, I do.
Oh.
Have a seat.
Mmm.
Some champagne?
Uh, no, thanks.
Come on.
This is Armand de Brignac.
Jay-Z drinks this.
Yeah, well, Jay-Z doesn't have to perform surgery in an hour.
You don't know Jay-Z's schedule.
He's a renaissance man.
Okay, fine.
Well, this is for you.
Oh!
Well, it's almost Valentine's Day, so I thought it would be a good day to tell you that Okay.
Let me just stop you right there.
Look, Tommy, I just want you to know I'm so grateful for everything you did for me, but I only see us as friends.
For now.
But think about how much better our friendship would be if we added doing it.
Seriously, I know our marriage was fake, but there's something between us.
And I think we should give it a shot, for real.
I just don't feel that way about you.
I'm sorry.
Each time I do Just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin I've got you Under my skin So, there's that one, I guess.
All right.
You guys sound ready for the dance tomorrow.
I don't know about these old fogy songs, Leslie.
Why can't we just do our originals?
I just wrote a new song, okay?
Bottom line, it's called Sex Hair.
It's about how you can tell when someone's just had sex 'cause of how their hair gets matted up in the back.
It's awesome.
Think of it this way.
These songs are exactly like the songs you usually play, except instead of modern rock, they're old jazzy standards from the '40s.
Okay, yeah.
You got a point.
Yeah.
You're gonna do great.
All right, guys.
Andy, I've been here for half an hour.
Can I get my shoes shined?
Kyle, I'm gonna lose my on you if you ask me one more time.
Found him.
Frank Beckerson, 63.
Lives in a little town called Bridgeport, Illinois.
Divorced, no kids, worked as a lifeguard when he was 20.
Ron, I need a half a day off for a secret mission of love.
You're asking my permission to take a nooner?
Sure.
Well, I don't know.
Maybe.
Justin and I need to go on a romantically-inspired road trip.
So it is a nooner?
Well, we're planning to leave around noon, so I'm not quite sure That's No, Leslie, that is not a nooner.
I tracked down this old flame of Leslie's mom.
We're gonna go pick him up.
We're gonna reunite them on Valentine's Day.
Is that a great story or what?
Yeah, great story indeed.
Enjoy your half day off.
Thank you.
Pick you up tomorrow around noon.
For our nooner.
Which is a cute word.
Explain it to her later.
Explain what?
Happy Valentine's Day.
First off, a bear in a paper bag and a heart-shaped balloon.
I love bears in bags.
Well, you will like this, then.
Because this is a giant teddy bear holding a red heart.
Aw!
Festive.
What's this?
Oh, I don't know.
It's a heart-shaped box of chocolates.
That's a dozen red roses in a heart-shaped arrangement.
See that?
Perfume.
For the lady.
Yeah.
Ooh!
Ooh!
"Yearning, by Dennis Feinstein".
Mmm.
Ooh!
Dennis.
No, no, Dennis.
Finally, The Heart of the Ocean.
Gorgeous.
I never had a chance to get a girl a clichéd Valentine's Day gift before.
So I got you all of them.
Thank you.
That was very sweet.
Do you think they'll get married?
Oh, my God, what if they get married?
That would be amazing.
Would I call him "Dad" then?
Hmm.
Hmm.
No, that'd be too much.
Maybe I'll call him "Pappy".
Pop?
Poppy?
Paw-Paw?
Look at me.
I'm getting ahead of myself.
Hey.
You never know.
I'm gonna call him "Poo-Paw".
How often do you get to reunite soul mates?
What if I told you that you could reunite Romeo and Juliet?
Or Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston?
Oh, Jen.
I really want you to be happy.
Stay away from John Mayer.
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Frank Beckerson.
I feel like I've known him my whole life.
Frank?
My God.
Marlene.
Oh, no.
Poo-Paw.
Poo-Paw, no.
I'm not Marlene.
Oh!
So sorry.
I should really wear my glasses.
Come on in.
Frank, I was wondering.
My mom always said that you wanted to be a lawyer.
Did that work out?
No.
Never did.
Though I did once act as my own lawyer.
Oh!
I found some old pictures of Marlene and me.
Look.
Look how young she is.
These are amazing.
Probably shouldn't show you this one.
No, thank you.
Your mom was such a firecracker.
Smart, funny, sharp as a tack.
Such firm breasts.
Oh, that was inappropriate.
Wow.
I am just, all of a sudden, so nervous to see her again.
I'm gonna throw up real quick and then we can leave.
Hi.
Hi.
Valentine's bash at The Bulge tonight.
We can get you a drink bracelet.
I can't.
I've gotta work at the Senior Center Valentine's Day Dance thing.
That sounds amazing.
Can we come?
I guess.
I don't know why you would want to.
Because old people are funny.
Yeah, it'll be like The Golden Girls.
I have to go get ready.
So, Frank, where have you been for the past 40 years?
Oh!
You know, here and there.
You know?
Grenada, for a while.
Then Panama, then Afghanistan.
So you were in the military?
Nope.
You know, I always wonder how different my life would've been if your mother had married me.
It would've been better.
I'll tell you that much.
Frank?
Frank, are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm good.
I am just so nervous to see her.
There is nothing to be nervous about.
Have you got a bag or something?
A what?
Do you have a bag?
I have a purse.
Well, give him the purse then.
All right.
You like potato and I like potahto You like tomato and I like tomahto Potato, potahto Tomato, tomahto Let's call the whole thing off.
Uh I mean, that sucked, didn't it?
Maybe if you sang it like Louis Armstrong.
Maybe, yeah.
I mean, here's the thing, though.
Who is that?
My problem is I don't know how to tell if we're doing good.
Because when you play a rock show, it's really easy to know if you're doing great because chicks will flash their boobs at you when you're up onstage.
And you're like, "Oh!
That must've sounded pretty good".
If that happens here, my eyes will fall out of my head and I'll die.
Frank?
Frank, are you okay?
Maybe we should Yeah.
Frank.
Frank.
Frank.
Frank.
But I can't see anybody but you Flip flop You know, I might be crazy, but I have this weird suspicion that things are going well with us.
You know, I have that same suspicion.
But having never been in something like this before, I feel the need to ask, how am I doing?
Come on.
No, I'm sort of serious.
All right, fine, forget it.
I'm just saying, you know, it seems to me, on paper, that this thing we have is pretty great.
Yes, nerd.
On paper, this thing we have is pretty great.
Mark is a great boyfriend.
I have no complaints at all.
Everything is good.
I don't know.
I don't feel right about this.
Are you kidding me?
This is so much fun.
Look, we took a road trip today.
We chased your mom's long lost love down a freeway.
He's a loon, Justin.
So he freaked out a little bit.
He got nervous.
I mean, you would, too.
He was fine by the time we got him back inside the car.
Yeah, well, he cried himself to sleep.
I mean, I don't know why you're pushing.
Why do you want him to spend time with my mom?
How would that help her?
I don't like this.
I don't think this is gonna work.
I'm calling this off.
Come on.
No, no, no.
Look, we're here.
Let's just see what happens.
What happens is, I drive him home.
Now, look.
You need to breathe.
I'm breathing.
Okay?
Mom.
Oh!
There you are.
So, what's the big surprise?
You gonna try to check me into an old folks home?
It's a long story.
One that we'd love to tell you over a cup of coffee, somewhere far from this place.
Frank.
Hello, Marlene.
My gosh.
I can't believe it's really you.
Wanna catch up?
Sure.
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
Do you think we should stand by She's fine.
Let's just let this unfold.
Come here, sonny.
Let me tell you about the Civil War.
Grandpa, leave me alone.
You smell like death.
I'm gonna get some punch.
Excuse me.
You guys are really adorable.
It's really nice.
So Leslie's like, "That's it, I'm taking him home".
So, we look over, and he's not even in the car anymore.
You're kidding.
No.
It's insane.
What does Leslie think about all this?
Oh, God, Leslie.
I don't even know.
I think I just lost track of her in all the chaos.
Anyway, so, now he and Marlene are off somewhere, doing God knows what.
I don't wanna You're suing me for alimony?
Yes.
When we were married, I got accustomed to a certain lifestyle.
And I'm entitled to money to maintain that lifestyle.
This is insane.
Yeah, it's insane, but it's all I got.
And you can make it all go away if you just gave me a chance.
What?
Three dates.
One date.
Coffee?
So your plan was to sue me, and then to use that to blackmail me into falling in love with you.
Yeah.
Hey.
You guys sound good.
You really think so?
It's impossible to tell.
It's like Bizarro Land out there.
As soon as we finish a song, it's dead silence.
Well, what do you expect, you know.
They're like a million years old.
Well, I'm glad you like it.
You were always a big supporter of the band.
Hey.
Break's over.
Ludgate, cracking the whip.
Yeah, well, these old bags paid for some entertainment.
So get up there.
No, you're right.
Okay.
Hey, you should play that song The Way You Look Tonight.
Hmm.
It's a good one.
The next one's going out to a special little lady named April Ludgate.
Someday When I'm all alone Are you guys Never mind.
Why do you care?
I don't.
Just thinking of you And the way you look tonight What about you?
What do you do for a living?
Well, it's been an interesting ride.
Yeah?
I got a job at a grocery store right out of college just for a way to make money.
And here I am, 40 years later, completely unemployed.
Wow.
What do you say we pick up where we left off?
You're not serious, right?
I'm serious as a heart attack.
Of which I've had four.
And the world is cold I will feel a glow Just thinking of you And the way you look tonight Hey, Mom, are you okay?
Did Frank leave?
Uh, yeah.
He just stepped away for a second.
I'm so sorry we brought him here.
Oh, it's okay.
It was very thoughtful, sweetheart.
It's not your fault that he turned out to be Excuse me.
Hi.
Excuse me, hi.
My name is Frank Beckerson.
Marlene, you blew it.
Take one last look, Marlene, because you'll never see this body again.
Marlene, what happened between you two?
Tell me everything.
I want every detail.
Hey, we're almost done, so we can leave soon.
Yes.
I'll take you for an ice cream malted, and then we can go choose our caskets.
God, why does everything we do have to be cloaked in, like, 15 layers of irony?
Here's something un-ironic.
Ever since you've been hanging out with that meathead, you've become completely lame.
You know what?
We're breaking up.
Fine, then you can't make out with me when you're drunk anymore.
Fine, then I'll make out with Ben.
Pass.
No, he's my boyfriend.
You can either make out with both of us or none of us.
Fine, none of you.
Fine.
I've got you Under my skin Everything okay, Knope?
My boyfriend is a lawyer, and he's smart and interesting, and there's a lot of things about him I like.
But he acted like a real jerk today.
I don't know.
There's something about the way he treats people or something.
He's a tourist.
He vacations in people's lives, takes pictures, puts them in his scrapbook, and moves on.
All he's interested in are stories.
Huh.
Basically, Leslie, he's selfish.
And you're not.
And that's why you don't like him.
I told you so.
It's Duke Silver.
Duke, can I have your autograph?
I love your music.
You're mistaken, ladies.
Move along.
I got you under my skin Yeah.
Go Mouse Rat.
I thought you were just terrific.
Seriously?
You sound like Dean Martin.
If I were 50 years younger What?
Wait.
Who's Dean Martin?
If I'm not mistaken, that was the old-lady version of flashing.
Nailed the gig.
Look, it's sad, I know.
But we'll still be friends.
We're gonna see each other all the time.
I come into town, like, every other weekend.
No.
You guys can't break up.
We can fix this.
Let me talk to Leslie.
Tom, it's over.
She doesn't wanna see me anymore.
Is it my fault?
Did I do something wrong?
No.
Seriously, this has nothing to do with you.
Can we still go suit shopping?
Of course.
Armani's having a sale right now.
I'm gonna get you a pocket square.
All right.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Are you kidding?
"I was here first"?
Get lost!
We were here first.
But we're scheduled for this time on this field.
Okay, this is no way for adults to act in front of children.
You're not only coaches, you're also role models.
I would hardly call what he does coaching.
Wow.
Excellent role modeling.
Apparently, the girls' team does not have a field assigned to them for practice, but the boys' team does.
No.
Not on my watch.
Every child has the right to play, no matter how boring the sport.
Okay.
Could you just share the field with the girls today, please?
I'm the girls' coach.
She's the boys' coach.
Oh.
Okay.
Sorry.
That's sexist.
No, it's not.
Yeah.
It kind of is.
Okay, why don't the boys take the field today.
And then I will make sure that the girls get a place to practice by the end of the week.
And that, little lady, is a Leslie Knope promise!
I'm a boy.
Good.
Yeah.
'Cause I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to you.
You're a girl, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She.
Mail's here.
Hey.
Now what?
Jerry!
You got soup all over our mail!
You jerk.
Oh, my God.
It's an envelope from the IOW Awards Office!
Nobody freak out!
Do you know what this means?
I am Pawnee's Woman of the Year!
The IOW is the Indiana Organization of Women.
I have been a dues-paying member since I was nine.
And every year, they choose one woman to win the Dorothy Everton Smythe Female Empowerment Award.
Winning is every girl's dream.
But it's my destiny.
And my dream.
Can you read it, please?
Where are my ladies at?
Here we go.
"The IOW is proud to announce this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe "Female Empowerment Award Winner, Ronald Swanson".
Ha-ha.
Okay, pretty funny.
It says Ronald Swanson.
What?
No, no.
No, it doesn't.
I That No.
That What?
They only honor women.
And Ron's the opposite of a woman.
What's going on?
You're Pawnee's Woman of the Year, it looks like.
Well, it's about time.
No, no, no.
They've obviously made some sort of mistake.
Bully for me!
Congratulations, Ron.
Yeah, congratulations.
Congrats.
That's awesome.
It's very exciting.
Awards are stupid, which is why I fully intend to decline this nonsense, and recommend it go to Leslie because she works really hard, and I don't.
However, she cares way too much about crap like this, which is why I can't pass up this opportunity to tease her about it.
Well, we can't stand around all day congratulating me on receiving an award from some lousy women's organization.
Back to work, everyone.
Hey, Freddy.
Good news!
Your liquor license renewal got got, yo.
What do you mean by that?
I got you temporary approval from the liquor board pending full-board authorization and council review.
Got got.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
No worries.
You know the Snakehole's my favorite Pawnee hot spot.
I want to open up my own club one day.
Maybe call it something like Club-a-Dub-Dub or The Clubmarine, sort of a submarine-themed club.
Or Tom's Bistro.
The word "bistro" is classy as.
Tom, we are looking for a few top-quality guys like yourself to become part-owners.
A guy like you, with your political connections, I think you'd make a great asset.
I agree.
That's why I got into public service.
To help me.
All right.
$10,000 a share.
I need the money by Friday.
$10,000.
That's chump change.
I will see you Friday with $10,000.
All right, partner.
I just don't get why the IOW would give that award to Ron.
Yeah, it's a bummer.
One, he's not a woman.
And two, they mentioned the Camp Athena project in that letter.
That's my project.
I started that.
It was my brainchild.
Why would Ron start a camp for troubled girls?
He wouldn't?
Exactly.
I deserve that award.
That award is mine.
Not his.
It's mine.
You know what you should do?
I know, I already started a list.
"Write an e-mail to Barack Obama.
"Lock myself in my office and scream until I lose my voice".
That's all I have so far.
I was gonna suggest maybe you just go and talk to him.
You're only gonna get more resentful if you don't.
Hmm.
Hey, Ann.
How Ann.
I have so much I need to tell you right now.
Hey, Ann.
Leslie would like to talk to you for a moment.
Is that all right?
Good.
Jean-Ralphio.
Big T!
What it do, nephew?
Jean-Ralphio, I have a hot investment opportunity that you are gonna wanna jump all over.
Hit me with it, daddy.
The Snakehole Lounge Heard of it.
Is looking for investors.
No way.
Yesterday, if you would have asked me, I would've said no, but thank God, my grandfather just died, so I am a- flush with cash!
Awesome.
I have 4,000 bucks.
All I need you to do is kick in six G's.
Six G's.
And then you and I are part-owners of the hottest nightclub in Pawnee.
Also, sorry about your grandpa.
No worries.
He was a dick.
Here's the thing.
I can kick in five G's.
That should be enough, right?
No, it's not enough.
I just said I need six G's.
What about your trust fund?
My parents had it amended.
I don't get anything until I'm 50, which is a waste, 'cause I'm gonna be a billionaire in Costa Rica by then, eating dolphins and hanging out with lady singers.
It's not a huge deal.
Just sit tight.
I'll take care of it.
You wanna come home with me?
Don't you work at Lady Foot Locker?
Look, if you're not gonna pay rent, at least clean up your dishes.
Is that all?
No.
Also, The Bag of Smells was a fun experiment, but it has to stop.
Come on!
No.
We're finally starting to get serious results.
Andy, dude, I love you, but shape up or move out.
What's going on?
The guitarist from my band is driving me crazy.
He's such a control freak.
"That's not a working fireplace, Andy".
"Stop writing phone messages on the wall, Andy".
"Dude, seriously, I love you "but stop digging that weird hole in the backyard".
Is Mouse Rat gonna break up?
Well, we're not Mouse Rat anymore.
We changed it to Tackleshaft.
Oh.
I should just get my own place.
You should.
I'll help you.
You can help me?
Yeah, that'd be fun.
April, you're like an angel with no wings.
So, like, a person?
Hey.
What's in the envelope?
Nothing.
You wanted to see me?
I think the Pawnee Chapter of the IOW has made a little mistake.
Really?
You're saying a women's organization made a mistake?
I was as surprised as you were.
But the fact is, they only give that award to women.
Hmm.
Well, it definitely said Ron Swanson in the letter.
Yeah, but it also mentioned my camp project.
Yes.
Camp Xena.
Athena.
Camp Athena.
You don't even know the name.
I almost got it.
I was pretty close.
No.
Look, Leslie, your job, which you're great at, is making me look good.
Which you've clearly done well because I'm getting an award.
Right?
Yeah.
Be proud of yourself.
You deserve an award.
Not this one, obviously, this one belongs to me, but some other one.
Some other lesser award.
And if the shoe were on the other foot and you won the award, I would've congratulated you.
Congratulations, Ron.
What's that?
You heard me.
You promised the girls a field by the end of this week.
Well, it's a man's world, Winston.
Get used to it.
I'm a man.
You know who you should talk to?
Ron Swanson.
He's an award-winning public servant.
He's the guy that's gonna help you out.
Go on in there.
Excuse me?
Ron, someone's coming in.
Hi.
Leslie said I should come over here.
If you don't get credit for your work, why bother doing it?
Because I love it!
But I'm going to make a point!
This VIP card gives you exclusive access to the investment opportunity of a lifetime.
Where?
Multipurpose Room F. When?
3:00 p.m. Dress code?
Black tie optional.
Just like life.
Hey, you wanted to see me?
Yes, yes.
Just hang on one second.
I'm doing my official portrait for the IUD Awards Dinner Program.
IOW.
No, this portrait is not official in any way.
I'm paying for it myself.
Did you need me?
Because some of us actually do work around here.
Work that often goes unrewarded.
I need your opinion.
Which of these objects most represents women for this portrait?
A pot?
Or this Deputy Director Barbie?
Isn't it adorable?
She's got a little briefcase, her cell phone.
"I'm going to help my boss win an award".
How's the scheduling conflict with the soccer teams going?
Take care of that, did you?
Nope.
Passed the buck to Donna.
That's not really the attitude I'd expect from an award winner.
Everything I do is the attitude of an award winner because I've won an award.
So, what kind of place are you looking for?
I can afford, like, I've always wanted a doorman named Ernie.
That'd be awesome.
Or Kipp.
I'm pretty flexible on that.
Here's a great one.
It's a Tudor mansion.
It's got seven rooms, four bathrooms.
It's got a tennis court, a pool and a three-car garage.
What?
And it's only $20,000 a month.
And it's in Chicago.
Ah!
That close!
It was almost perfect.
Actually, there are a couple of cool places in here.
Let's go look at them!
Now?
Let's roll.
Okay.
Thank you all so much for joining me today.
I have two questions for you.
One, are you ready for the investment opportunity of a lifetime?
And two, do any of you have pacemakers or a history of epilepsy?
Yes, both.
Anybody?
No?
Both.
All right.
Ladies!
Jay-Z.
Rihanna.
Audrina Patridge.
Jon Gosselin.
Lady Gaga.
Snooki.
Are these real people?
Cash Warren and Dennis Rodman.
These are just a few of the celebrities that wish they could invest in Pawnee's hottest club.
But they can't.
And you can.
For the small price of only one, one, one, thousand, thousand, thousand dollars, dollars, dollars!
The only question is, who's gonna be my partner?
Mark, I'm talking to you!
Donna, I'm talking to you!
Jerry!
I'm talking to you!
Mark!
I'm talking to you!
Twenty-six certificates , plaques, ribbons, trophies, medals and miscellany certifying that I am the kind of person who deserves recognition for her achievements.
What do you have, Ron?
I have the Dorothy Every Time Smurf Girl Trophy for excellence in female stuff.
Dorothy Everton Smythe.
I swear to God, I would Leslie.
Before you continue, please read this.
Another organization giving you credit for something you didn't do?
"I, Ron Swanson, recognize that "Leslie Knope should have received the IOW Award "for all the hard work she has done, "especially for the Camp Athena project.
"However, in my opinion, "she is far too concerned with institutional gratification".
No, I'm not.
"So, I am going to let her dangle "in order to show her that awards are bull crap".
Come on, Leslie, you know I'm not sexist.
I love powerful women.
You do attend a shocking number of WNBA games.
I'm just saying that awards are political, and everybody has an agenda.
If you spend your life chasing them, you'll drive yourself nuts.
Yeah, all right.
But Dorothy Everton Smythe was a trailblazing feminist.
She was the first woman in Pawnee to wear pants on a Sunday.
She spent four years in jail for that.
I know I'm not supposed to care about these things, but this one means a lot.
I know you've been changing The acoustics in the bathroom are insane.
So, how much is this one again?
This one is $425 a month, plus utilities.
I like it.
It seems to have a lot of potential and a lot of "advantages," per se.
I could definitely picture myself doing something over there.
Can you hear that?
What is that?
It's still on.
You can light a match to get rid of that smell.
I feel really good about this.
Really?
It screams Andy Dwyer.
And I live nearby.
So, we could, like, carpool to work or something.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
The scream just got louder.
So, what do you think?
I don't know.
Make me an offer.
Okay.
First come, first served.
Who's in?
Jerry?
Jeez, Tom, if I spend any more than 25 bucks, I gotta ask my wife.
Jerry, get out.
Okay.
"Mark?
What are we doing tonight"?
"I don't know, Ann.
"We could do the usual boring stuff like eat some chicken salad "with some crackers, or watch the pay-per-view, "or we could go to my nightclub and do some dancing".
I don't think so, man.
You'd never have to beg for sex again.
I don't wanna get into this, really, but I don't beg for sex now.
Forget about that, Mark.
Are you in or out?
It's just not really my thing.
Bye, Mark.
Cindi.
Donna?
Maybe.
I like The Snakehole.
Plus, I would look good pulling into my owner's parking space in my Mercedes.
Just to be clear, you wouldn't be an owner, per se.
You, me and my boy, Jean-Ralphio, would each own part of a share.
Will that be cash or check?
Not so fast.
I like to know who I'm in business with.
I want to meet your boy.
In here.
This lady's here.
Hi, I'm Elise Yarktin, I'm with the IOW.
I'm Woman of the Year, Ron Swanson.
Yes, I know.
We are very excited to be presenting you with the Smythe Award.
That's what I called you to talk about.
I don't know if I can take all of the excitement.
So, I think the award should go to Miss Knope, here.
Hello.
She's the one who really deserves it.
Camp Athena was her idea.
She did all the work.
You made a mistake.
We didn't make a mistake.
We made a very conscious decision this year to choose a man.
Why?
Well, every year, we give it to a woman, and, frankly, nobody cares.
Yeah, the media has all but written us off as a niche interest group.
But if you give a women's award to a mustachioed, masculine man, such as yourself, well, then, eventually, people take notice.
I don't want the damn thing.
Well, we're giving it to you.
So, you're gonna take it, like a man.
So congratulations.
The IOW is a bunch of sexist jerks who need to get back in the kitchen where they belong, and leave the real feminist work to actual feminists like Ron Swanson!
Oh, my God!
What is happening?
Now do you see how silly these things are?
Unbelievable.
Obviously, I'm just gonna decline it.
No, I want you to accept it.
I want you to go to the podium and talk about how stupid awards are.
And how they are superficial and meaningless.
I want you to rip awards a new a-hole!
Now we're talking.
I tell you what.
You write the speech.
Don't pull your punches.
I won't.
I'm gonna push my punches as far as my fists can extend!
Attagirl.
Kind of.
What up, Big T!
Stop.
This must be the lovely Donna.
Listen, beautiful, let's cut the bull, right?
You want this.
I definitely want this.
T.H. wants this.
Let's seal this devil's three-way right here, right now.
Step one, we buy into this club.
Step two, we roll over to the club, either in your Mercedes Benz or my pre-owned Acura Legend.
Step three, I dagger you on the dance floor.
Just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce Now, all the ladies say it Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce What do you say, sexy?
I'm out.
Why?
I hate that guy.
Mr. Swanson.
Hi, welcome to the IOW Awards, and congratulations on winning.
Yay!
Well, here is your awards packet, and if you will just follow me, we're gonna have a little meet-and-greet before the ceremony.
Okay.
Great.
No, I'm sorry.
This area is for award winners only.
Get over yourself, Elise.
Work on the speech.
Let's nail these women.
You know what I mean.
Yeah.
I don't know, Andy.
What's it all about?
What's the secret?
Yeah.
Why's it so hard to become a mogul?
All I want in life is to own a nightclub on every continent, have my own line of upscale sweat suits, and a cologne called Tommy Fresh.
And I fell $1,000 short.
Seriously?
That's all you needed?
Tom, I have $1,000.
You can have it.
Thanks, Andy, but I can't take your money.
I'm a singerlsongwriter.
The two lines I've put into every song I've ever sang, "Spread your wings and fly," and "You deserve to be a champion".
If you're telling me that all you need is $1,000 to do your dreams, then I want you to have it.
Are you sure about this?
Maybe.
You don't know how happy you just made me.
He's the Director of the Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department.
He is also the recipient of this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe Female Empowerment Award.
Please put your hands together for Mr. Ron Swanson.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Every award, from the smallest trophy to the Nobel Prize, is nothing more than Is nothing more than a great way to honor someone.
So, I would like to present this year's Dottie English Whatever Award to the person who actually deserves it, Leslie Knope.
Come on up here, Leslie.
Thank you.
I don't know what to say.
Honestly, I'm just very honored to work for someone as insightful and kind as my boss.
So, I would like to present this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe Award to Ron Swanson.
I don't want it.
Just take the damn thing.
You deserve it.
No, no.
Really.
No, Ron, you deserve it.
Really, but I don't want it.
But you won it.
And you should win it.
You should take it.
After that whole conversation I'm being ridiculous.
You've done Could someone please just take it?
Okay, I'll take it.
Who do I speak to about getting this changed?
Get off the stage!
Yeah!
I still think awards are stupid.
But they'd be less stupid if they went to the right people.
You gave Tom all your money?
Yeah, well, I'm investing.
I'm like Warren Buffay.
I kind of feel like it would have been good for you to have your own place.
Yeah, I know.
But I feel like Tom really needed the money, and small sacrifice to see one of your best friends' dreams come true.
They cropped you out.
Figures.
So, where are you gonna put it?
I have an idea.
One, two, three.
Two, three.
What's up?
Hey, guys.
How long did you wait in line?
I didn't wait at all!
I'm a part-owner.
Freddy!
I'm back.
Tom Haverford, part-owner.
Let me know if you need anything.
Keep this booth warm for me every night.
I'm gonna live in this booth.
Yes, sir.
Donna?
What are you doing here?
I bought three shares.
Thanks for the tip.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Ann Perkins.
What's happening, sweetheart?
Just waiting for April.
She's taking care of my house while I'm away, so That's great.
Happy belated Valentine's Day.
Valentine's Day was a month ago.
Why are you giving it to me now?
Whatever.
Happy early Valentine's Day.
I saw this and I thought of you.
Hope you keep that somewhere special.
Okay.
This is one of those nanny-cam teddy bears, isn't it?
What?
No.
It's a regular, camera-less teddy bear.
Just put it in your bedroom, don't even think about it.
It's a robot bear.
It's programmed to snuggle!
I'll take it.
Donna, there's a camera in it.
I know.
All right.
That's basically it.
Water the plants, get the mail.
Can I read your mail?
No.
Please, don't.
Fine.
Oh.
And here are the keys, and remember I know.
Don't let Tom make a copy.
That's right.
Good.
I'm paying April 50 bucks to watch my house while I'm away.
I would have asked Leslie, but I've seen the way she takes care of her house.
Plus, there's always been a little distance between me and April.
And I thought this would maybe, I don't know, give us a chance to get a little closer.
Maybe even I don't like Ann.
Become friends.
Who knows?
Leslie, this is Evelyn Rowshlind, from the mayor's office.
Oh, hello!
I've always dreamed of you.
Excuse me?
Meeting you.
What can I do for you?
Have a seat.
I prefer to stand.
Okay.
I have kind of an odd favor to ask.
Mayor Gunderson was playing golf last week at Pawnee Municipal, and he brought his dog and Rufus.
We all know Rufus.
Everybody loves Rufus.
He's a great dog.
Continue.
Well, they were out on the sixth hole when suddenly, out of nowhere Rufus was bitten by a possum?
Yes.
How did you know that?
It was Fairway Frank.
Fairway Frank is this awful possum who lives near the sixth hole of the public golf course.
And he's actually number three on the Parks Department's Most Wanted Pest List, right behind the bats, who like to poop on the bell tower, and Poopy, the raccoon who poops all over the high school cafeteria.
Shouldn't you take this up with Animal Control?
Let's be honest.
Animal Control is not the most effective branch of our government.
They're a bunch of burned-out morons.
Well, you have the reputation as a person who gets things done, so we'd like you to form a little task force, find the animal and put it down.
A task force?
Needless to say, the mayor will be very grateful for your help.
Ma'am, the next time we speak, we shall be dancing on the grave of a possum.
Great.
Ron will show you around.
Right this way is the exit.
Yo, police!
No, you're not.
Coffee!
You always know what to bring me.
I only ever bring you coffee.
And it is my very favorite non-alcoholic hot drink, except for hot tea.
And hot orange juice, weirdly delicious.
Anyways, thank you so much.
I need it.
I got a really bad case of shoeshine head today.
Andy recently diagnosed himself with what he calls "shoeshine head".
It's when you shine too many shoes and the fumes create a thunderstorm in your brain.
Cures include coffee, cheeseburgers and napping on the floor.
Mark Brendanawicz!
Hey, Ron, what's up?
I have a woodshop, and I'm planning a little expansion.
Need my buddy, Mark the city planner, to sign off on the plans.
Sure, I just need to schedule an inspection.
That's not really necessary.
Yes, it is.
But you'll be fine as long as you don't have any code violations.
You don't have any code violations, do you?
Nope.
Eugene!
Boy, we have a really important job for you.
We'll get to it first thing Monday.
Today's Wednesday.
Look, this is not a request.
We're acting under direct orders from Mayor Gunderson's dog.
Office.
I need your two best guys to join me and be part of my task force.
That would be Harris and Brett.
But they're not here.
Isn't that them, there?
Nope.
Hey, Brett.
Yeah?
Dude.
Listen, that stupid possum is on the golf course again.
Would you rather I capture it myself, and then just call you, so you can come and pick it up?
Okay.
Hey, guys.
Cool!
Hey, you want your ball back?
Want your ball back?
Come with me.
Oh, man!
How you know my name, homie?
Stop, man!
Stop hanging yourself.
I'm gonna hang yourself.
Stop hanging yourself.
It's quite a crack team you've assembled, Leslie.
Yeah, well, there's five of us and only one possum.
How hard can it be?
Excuse us!
Task force coming through!
Task force clear.
Resume golfing.
I used to love Tiger Woods because he was a great champion.
But after that sex scandal?
The man is a god!
Hey, Mark.
Welcome to my haven.
Thank you.
You are the first non-me to set foot in this building in 10 years.
Ron, none of this is up to code.
Sure it is.
It's up to the Swanson Code.
There's no drainage.
Doesn't seem to be any ventilation.
You've got hazardous chemicals over here.
Yeah, which only I'm breathing.
It's the same liberty that gives me the right to fart in my own car.
Are you gonna tell a man that he can't fart in his own car?
There is a basket of oil-soaked rags above a wood-burning stove.
Good thing I've got a fire extinguisher, which, I can assure you, is totally up to your precious code.
This says it should be recharged June of 1996.
Those dates are arbitrary.
They're like those expiration dates that the government forces companies to put on yogurt and medicine.
Observe.
Watch yourself.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll replace this.
Happy?
How long do you think it would take me to learn golf, Leslie?
I could teach you.
I have a 16 handicap.
But, you know, it takes a lot of practice.
You have to get up early, hit the range, practice reading greens.
Yeah, I don't want to do all that.
I think I just want some of those dope pants.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
It's Fairway Frank!
Wow.
Okay.
All right.
Tom, I want you to very slowly Move!
Get out of the way!
Five, Come on, Brendanawicz, relax.
Let me make you a canoe.
Well, I don't need a canoe, Ron.
I need you to fix this place up.
So, I'll give you Okay, we may only get one chance to catch this thing, so we have to play it smart.
You two, flank the left.
I'll flank the right.
Andy will come in to Andy!
I got it!
Oh, my God!
Task force, engage!
I got him!
He's got it.
He's good.
I got him.
Come on, you cowards!
Let me see his face.
Let me see his face!
That's him!
That's him!
We got him!
It's okay.
He's on my neck!
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
He's on my neck!
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
All right, it's okay.
You're next, Poopy.
Very impressive, Leslie.
Oh, thank you.
I had a great task force.
I was just the simple mastermind who planned the whole operation and executed it to perfection.
This is Andy Dwyer, he actually caught the thing.
Mr. Dwyer.
Please, my friends call me Andy Radical.
No, we don't.
By day, Andy Dwyer, shoeshine-ist.
By a different time of day, Andy Radical, possum tackler.
And by night, I do whatever I want.
No job.
We think that this is a great PR opportunity.
So, we've arranged for a reporter from the Journal to stop by to interview, get some pictures of the team.
Task force.
Great!
And next time you need a special favor from the mayor's office, give me a call.
Oh, my God, I will!
I need so many special favors.
Which one should I choose?
Well, you don't have to choose right How about an extra recycling can?
No.
Laminated bus pass?
No.
What time do you usually go to sleep?
Because my best ideas usually come to me at night.
Let's stick to business hours, shall we?
Yeah, all right.
See you in hell, buddy.
Am I sure the possum we caught is Fairway Frank?
Yes.
Am I quite sure?
No.
Am I sure enough?
Maybe.
If it wasn't Fairway Frank, would I feel badly?
Of course.
Could I live with myself?
That depends.
As a city official, it's important that I ask myself a lot of questions.
Does doing so help me make decisions?
Uh Oh, hey, Shauna.
Hi, Leslie.
Hi!
Andy.
You remember Shauna Malwee-Tweep, from the Pawnee Journal?
How could I forget?
You wrote the article when I fell in the pit.
And then afterwards, had sex with Mark and everyone talked about it.
So, you're on the golf course, and you see Fairway Frank.
Well, we see a possum that we believe to be Fairway Frank.
So, for right now, let's just refer to it as a possum.
Let me explain something to you, Tweep.
When you're in a situation, you don't have time to think.
So, I thought to myself, "Don't think, Andy, act".
So, you weren't thinking?
Not at all.
I cannot emphasize enough how little I was thinking.
Were you scared?
No.
No, I wasn't.
Well, I I lived in the pit for the better part of last year, and made some vermin friends.
You know what?
"Friends" sounds stupid.
Colleagues.
They are bad at sharing, but they are good at tag.
Well, your family must be very proud.
What does your girlfriend think?
The nurse.
I broke up with Ann.
Yeah.
Shortly after she kicked me out and told me we wouldn't be together anymore.
Well, maybe this article will change her mind.
What now?
I hadn't even thought of that.
Wow.
Of all the things I thought would bring us back together, catching a possum was never on that list.
Well, let's go take some pictures of Fairway Frank.
Of the possum.
Seriously, man, when you wear these clothes, you just feel better than everyone else.
You know?
Yeah.
Busy?
No.
What's up?
Just wanted to tell you, I understand that city codes exist, and I know why they exist.
And I understand that you enforce them.
Okay.
Okay.
Good talk.
Can you sign off on my plans now?
Did you get everything up to code?
Yup.
No, you didn't!
You clearly didn't!
It's my property, my land, my shop.
Ooh.
Tommy needs a banana.
You guys good?
Ron, you're asking me to do a bad job at my job, and I'm just not gonna do that.
So, if you don't mind, would you please just get out of my office?
Ooh.
Silly me.
There was this little pom-pom on my glove and it fell off.
Have you seen it?
Could you help me look for it real quick?
It should be on the ground somewhere.
When I was putting it up.
See.
So, how's your hole?
Excuse me?
The pit.
Lot 48.
Oh, we're making really good progress on the park.
In fact, there may be some big news on that front coming soon, all because of this very important business card.
So, this isn't a really big story, right?
Nobody cares about this very much.
Well, Fairway Frank did bite the mayor's dog.
So, this could be on the front page.
Fairway Frank You're gonna die You're gonna fry, oh, yeah You guilty son of a bitch You're gonna fry When they flip that switch Hey, April, can I talk to you about this situation with the possum?
No.
Okay.
Hypothetically, if you were going on a mission to, say, catch a guilty whale.
And while you were catching the whale, you saw something else that may also be another whale, and you were like, "What"?
But then yout hought, maybe it's not a whale.
Maybe it's a big fish.
Maybe it's a submarine with a face painted on it.
The point is, if I kill the first whale, am I technically a murderer?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I saw a second possum!
There was another possum!
Wait.
Andy's in there talking to a reporter, literally kissing his own biceps and you're telling me he might not be a hero, but just some jerk that goes around tackling random possums?
No.
I've gotta help Leslie find the truth.
Not because I'm pissed at Andy, which I'm not.
Because I care so deeply about possums.
Because they're so adorable.
April!
Did you see my photo shoot?
I think I nailed it.
I fell off the stool once when I was trying to look serious, but I'm okay.
That's cool.
I'm really happy for you.
You are?
Man, our happy reactions are super different.
So, he said he's gonna e-mail me the photos in, like, six hours.
Do you want to wait with me?
Yeah, that sounds good, but I can't because I have to go do something that actually matters.
Fairway Frank's been haunting the sixth hole for a while now.
You must know him pretty well.
Sure do.
I've chased that little sucker off more times than I can count.
Can you just take a look at these photos and make sure that it's Fairway Frank?
Yup, that's him.
Mr. Campopiano, those are photos of three different possums.
Huh.
You guys want something to drink?
Hey, boss.
There's a possum wandering around on the 14th green.
Should I call Animal Control again?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Those idiots are here from Animal Control.
They're gonna take it away.
Okay.
We need a little bit more time to figure out the truth.
Look, I have an idea.
I'm gonna distract everybody and then you get that possum out of here.
Can you do that, April?
April, can you do that?
Can you get the possum out of here?
Can you sneak it out of here?
April, can you do it?
Can you do it?
Please, April, tell me you can do it!
Yes.
Yes, I can do it.
God.
I can't kill the possum, because it might be innocent.
I can't let the possum go, because it might be guilty.
I can't make a good soup, can't do a handstand in a pool, can't spell the word "lieutenant".
There's a lot of can'ts in my life right now.
Let's make it happen, Captain.
Don't call me that.
You know what smells?
Help!
Help, my arm looks like it's bleeding!
Holy cow!
Leslie!
Oh, boy.
Oh, look how much it's bleeding.
Everybody look at it.
Everybody look over here!
I need everyone's full attention during this.
That's a lot of blood.
It is, it's so It's ketchup!
Is it?
Jerry.
Jerry.
Yes.
It's ketchup.
Sentry duty is usually approximately one hour long.
Baby meerkats do not start foraging for food until about one month old.
Do you know them?
What do you mean that Fairway Frank is not here?
Here's the thing, Evelyn, we're not sure that the possum we caught is, in fact, Fairway Frank.
Leslie, whoever it is, it's a possum.
And the sooner it's dead, the sooner the mayor can do what he wants with it.
Does he want to have sex with a dead possum?
No!
No.
He's not a monster.
He wants to stuff it and hang it above the urinal in his office bathroom so that little flecks of pee can get on it forever.
Ew!
Now, Leslie, you did a great job, and the mayor knows that you did a great job.
Now, where is the possum?
I'm sorry, but he's somewhere you'll never find it and he's gonna stay there until the truth comes out.
And I will not reveal his location, no matter how much you ask me.
But I'm going to stop talking now because I'm afraid I may accidentally say where it is, so please go.
This is interesting.
They put down a raccoon that bit a jogger in a park in Staten Island.
Wow.
And in Walnut Creek, California, they put down a duck that bit a kid.
But security footage later revealed that it was actually a goose.
That's great.
No, it's awful, Tom.
How would you feel if you killed an innocent duck and let a vicious goose waddle free?
Tom Haverford.
Tom!
It's April, I'm at Ann's house and the possum's loose!
Okay?
I need your help!
Oh, my God!
It's chewing on everything!
Don't tell Leslie.
You got it.
The possum got loose at Ann's house.
Oh, my God!
April!
April, it's Leslie Knope, from the Parks Department.
Stop ringing the doorbell, it's making him mad.
Oh, my God!
How did this happen?
I let it out of its cage because it needed water, and I thought it would just drink out of the toilet or something, but then it ran off and I couldn't get it back in.
He did that, too.
Oh, boy.
Yeah, and then I opened all the doors because I thought it would just go outside, but it won't leave the house!
It must love tacky pictures of flowers.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm gonna fix this.
Let me just think for a second.
Uh-oh.
What?
Where is it?
I can't see it!
No!
Okay, where did it go?
I don't know!
I don't know.
Here's what we do, we just go outside.
All right?
Let's just go outside!
Get in here!
I haven't even started yet.
I know.
Thought you could use some help.
Those city planning guys can be real pains in the ass.
Okay.
I just want you to know that I still don't think city codes Ron, shut up.
Would you, please?
I'm taking a half-day off to come and help you out because you're my friend, so just shut up.
No, I am bringing my workshop up to the Swanson Code.
And if the Swanson Code happens to overlap with the City Government Code Shut up.
I know there's a door there, but I kind of feel like it's going to chew through the door and come and jump on my face and bite me.
Ew.
I know!
What if it's in here?
What if it laid eggs in the bed?
Okay, there There are no eggs!
You know, we should've killed it.
It's so huge.
I'm gonna call Andy.
No.
Yeah.
He tackled it once before, he can do it again.
No, please don't, okay?
He's gonna be pissed at me.
I already ruined his big day, and it's my fault that it's in Ann's house, who he's obviously still in love with.
I just I don't want him to be mad at me, okay?
Oh.
April.
He'll forgive you.
You think so?
Yeah.
We don't have to call Andy.
We can just call Animal Control.
Okay.
And, April, any time you want to talk about boys Oh, my God!
Stop!
Yo.
So, I feel like you were mad at me yesterday and I don't know why.
So, I made a list of everything I did and I'm gonna try not to do any of them again.
Also, I got you this coffee.
And then there's this.
Fourth paragraph down.
"But Dwyer had some help catching the possum.
"'I wouldn't have been able to do it "without an early-morning caffeine boost "'from the amazing April Ludgate.
"'She gave me the liquid courage I needed "'to wrestle that beast to the ground".
' Well, Miss Knope.
I have to say I'm very disappointed.
You didn't have to say that, you could've just thought it.
What did you do with the possum, exactly?
Well, I'm proud to say that it's somewhere the mayor can never pee on it.
It's okay.
Honestly.
I mean, look.
When I retire and I'm attending some gala honoring the first three female presidents in history, myself and two other women I've inspired, I want to be looking back at my distinguished legacy and not thinking that I owe my career to some possum.
And I want to be wearing a huge, beautiful, blue hat!
Thank you so much.
Sure.
It made me feel so happy that I knew somebody was here taking care of my house.
Cool.
So, did the neighbors give you any problems?
No.
Anything in Possum.
There was a possum.
We captured a possum and we brought it into your house and it got out and it might have laid eggs in your bed.
What?
And it went into your laundry and your kitchen, and it touched all your bras and I'm so sorry.
It's our fault.
We captured it and it got out and it ran around and it was a possum.
Okay?
April, run!
Run, April.
Sorry, Ann!
I love you!
I'm gonna go.
I think that would be best.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Okay, everybody.
Time for the hummingbird lottery.
Okay.
You know how it works.
Write your name down on a piece of paper.
No, they don't win a hummingbird.
I installed hummingbird feeders in all the parks, so the winner gets to refill those feeders.
Scientifically, hummingbirds are the world's cutest animals.
I mean, they're so small.
And they have tiny beaks.
And they only eat sugar water.
I mean, what beats that?
Come on.
Baby monkeys in diapers?
Yeah.
They do.
Baby monkeys in diapers are the cutest.
Okay.
Who's it going to be?
Not me.
Not me.
Not me.
Not me.
Jerry.
Yeah!
You can stop by tomorrow morning before work.
This is my third time in a row.
Just a bad luck streak, buddy.
Next time, I'm sure it will definitely be one of us.
But it won't be me.
Because I always write Yeah.
Yep.
No, I always write my own name.
But just to be safe, I do add 20 extra "Jerry"s.
And finally, we are going to kick off the Children's Concert Series this weekend with a performance by Freddy Spaghetti.
I thought Freddy Spaghetti OD'd.
No.
That's Mr. Funny Noodle.
And he didn't OD, his drummer shot him.
Oh.
Where is Jerry, by the way?
Why isn't he back?
How long does it take to fill bird feeders?
Maybe he fell into the toilet.
Remember when he fell into the toilet?
"Oh, sorry, guys.
Sorry I'm late.
"I got confused and took a shower, "after I got dressed, because I'm Jerry".
David Meyers, the Jewish guy who works at City Hall, once told me something.
A "schlemiel" is the guy who spills soup at a fancy party.
A "schlimazel" is the guy he spills it on.
Jerry is both the "schlemiel" and the "schlimazel" of our office.
"And then I put my underwear on my head instead of my butt".
Okay.
Okay, guys.
That's enough.
Unless somebody has another good one.
Oh.
Hi, Ann.
Oh, no.
Jerry.
Jerry, are you okay?
Ann, is Jerry okay?
What's wrong with your arm?
Ann, tell me what's wrong with Jerry's arm.
Jerry, talk to me.
Ann, get Jerry to talk to me.
Okay.
He's okay.
He's got a couple of scrapes and a dislocated shoulder.
Oh!
What happened?
You guys are just going to laugh.
Why?
Did you throw out your shoulder trying to swing a honey pot off your hand?
I was mugged.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Jerry.
I was on my way to the hummingbird feeders and I was walking Lord Sheldon.
Ew!
Is that code for some kind of weird sex act?
Lord Sheldon is my dog.
My wife named him.
Ew!
Anyway, these kids, they came out of nowhere, they pinned my arm back, they grabbed my wallet, and they knocked me to the ground.
How did you counter-attack?
Fist to the throat?
Did you hit him in the beanbag?
There's no shame in attacking a criminal's beanbag.
No, I just curled up and laid still until they left.
Well, that's another way to play it.
Did any of them have weird tattoos or scars or anything?
If even one of them had a unique scar, we got them.
I didn't get a good look.
Damn it, Jerry.
Sorry.
You're the victim.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I feel like we're responsible for this.
Why?
We didn't mug Jerry.
Well, why was he in the park in the first place?
Because we tricked him into going there.
I don't see the connection.
I don't know.
This is on us.
It's karma.
Wouldn't it be karma if we were the ones that got mugged?
Yeah.
That's how pathetic Jerry is.
He can't even get karma right.
No, that's not funny.
Our friend got mugged this morning.
And we will not let that happen in vain.
He doesn't have a black eye.
Well, frankly, the whole department has a black eye.
This is our wake-up call, guys.
Jerry's face is the symbol of failure.
Our failure to keep the parks safe.
I have some folders.
Inside are some assignments.
And some homemade taffy.
Mmm.
Mmm-hmm.
April, I want you to check in with our police liaison.
Donna, I need you to go to Ramsett Park.
Tom, you're with me.
So, when you say that you want me to check in with the police liaison, you mean hook up with him, right?
No.
Just check in with him.
Everybody dismissed.
Wait.
I want to help.
What?
I'm going to teach everybody self-defense, so you can defend yourselves.
We need it.
Because we certainly are a bunch of weaklings.
Especially Tom.
I am not a weakling.
Arm wrestle me right now.
Okay.
I think I'm more than holding my own here Three, four, five Hey.
Six.
Hey!
How you doing?
Not too bad.
I was just dropping off Jerry from the hospital.
He was mugged in the park.
No.
Jerry?
The black guy with the Looney Tunes ties?
I love him.
No.
Jerry who works with Leslie.
That Jerry?
Yeah.
He got mugged?
Oh.
Well, I mean, that's kind of a bummer, too.
Hey, while I have you here, what do you think of this?
Uh Scrotation Marks.
I don't know what you're talking about, but my gut says no.
New band name.
Because "Mouse Rat," it's a great name, but at the same time, it sucks.
So, I think we have to change it just one more time Dude, you've got to stop doing that.
How are people going to become fans if they literally don't know the name of the band they're listening to?
That is a really good point.
I always had fun with Andy.
The problem is, when you're his girlfriend, you're also his mother, and his maid and his nurse.
He's completely helpless.
He's like a baby in a straightjacket.
Ooh!
"Baby in a Straightjacket.
" That's a good band name.
I should tell him that.
Ha-ha, guys.
Really funny.
Where's the real banner?
We only had an hour.
So did I. Look what I did.
Hey, guys.
Jerry!
Welcome back.
Really.
My gosh, you should not have gone to all this trouble.
Oh.
It's no trouble for our buddy.
Here you go.
Listen.
Today is Jerry Day.
We'll do whatever you want to do.
Anything at all.
Honestly, what I would like to do is just have everything go back to normal.
That sounds good to me.
Okay.
I believe you were going to do a presentation.
Yes, sir, I was.
I will go set up.
Okay.
Remember, you guys.
No jokes.
No comments.
Nothing but support.
He needs a lot of support.
Tom.
Talking about a bra for a man.
Okay, seriously.
That was the last one.
So, as we know, Spring Hunting Season is upon us.
Uh, anyway, here's the info about the new licensing system.
Um Jerry?
I don't I don't think your computer is plugged in.
I'm sorry, guys.
Just got to power up.
First thing we should have is my graph about the season.
What?
Wait a minute.
No.
That is not the graph.
That's a picture from my vacation to Muncie.
You went on a vacation and you chose Muncie, Indiana?
Yeah.
My wife and I have a time-share.
In Muncie?
Tom, Muncie is a lovely city.
Anyway, Hunting and Fishing Season is winding down.
Okay?
And we all know that it's already closed season on "twout".
So, now I said "twout" instead of "trout".
It happens to everyone.
My marbles are full of mouth today.
You know what?
Has anybody seen my glasses?
I don't even think I can It says here "1:00 meeting.
" And who are we meeting with?
Don't worry about it.
Oh, no.
Please, no.
Tom, it's important to meet with the Park Rangers.
They are the first line of defense.
Leslie Knope!
Hey, Carl.
What's up, pencil pushers?
Haverford.
Good to see you, man.
Is it hot in here?
I feel hot.
Are you guys hot?
How you guys doing?
I'm good.
You guys got any snacks?
Carl is the head of all outdoor security.
Why was he transferred from his indoor desk job, you ask.
Listen.
Hey, Leslie.
Have you seen Avatar?
I never saw Avatar.
I wanted to read the book first, but then I realized there's no book version of Avatar.
What did you guys do for St. Patty's Day?
I was wearing this t-shirt that said "Kiss me, I'm Irish".
But no one would kiss me.
So.
You're too important for me until one of your own gets attacked.
I just feel like there's more we can do to keep the parks safe.
Oh, you think you know how to do my job?
Well, you might not be so confident once you've walked a mile in my size sevens.
Kind of small feet.
Actually, seven is the worldwide average.
Boom!
Welcome to the emergency self-defense class.
I'll be showing you how to escape from a variety of situations, while inflicting maximum damage on your attackers.
Ron, do you think that maybe I should put Mark in a headlock?
That way, I can show everyone how to escape a pervert?
In the scenario you just laid out, you're the pervert.
You understand that, right?
You wish.
Enough.
I'm going to start off simple, and demonstrate how to extract oneself from a wrist grab.
Andy.
Ann.
Step up here.
I watch a lot of Lifetime movies.
There was this one, How Far is Too Far Enough: The Teri Palliber Lonergan Story.
This woman had agoraphobia and her therapist was obsessed with her, and he hid in her house.
And then he attacked her and tried to eat her toes.
Also, her daughter was having sex way too young.
So, yeah.
Free self-defense class?
I'm there.
And then just twist away.
Very good.
Very good.
Well done.
Oh!
What's up now, mugger?
Ann, that was awesome.
That was really good.
I don't know, Leslie.
I'd rather be back at the office.
I know this is painful for you, Jerry, but you have to be strong.
You guys ready?
Oh, boy.
Yeah, okay.
We're ready.
I'm going to show you guys all the problems we've been facing.
I'm going to show you that we've been doing everything we can.
Well, I'm looking forward to working together, Carl.
And after that, I'm going to show you this log I found.
It's got, like, fifty worms on it.
I call it "worm log".
Yeah, I've always been a bit of an outdoorsman.
When I was a kid, my parents used to make me hang out in the backyard a lot and just run around until I got tired.
But if there's any criminals out there watching, I never get tired.
And ladies, too.
This thing is a mess.
We used to have three carts, actually.
The first one got pushed into the creek by some kids.
The second one, raccoons got onto.
There was urine everywhere.
And the third one was recently stolen.
What's this one?
This is the second one.
The raccoon piss one.
All right.
So we're going to just head out.
Oh, no.
You know what?
I think we've got too much weight.
Oh.
That's Tom, probably.
Are you serious?
Tom, can you get off, please?
Just run alongside the cart, okay?
Okay.
Here we go.
Whoa!
So, I want to tell you a little bit about the park.
Up here on the left is one of our most beautiful grass fields.
It's primarily grass.
All right, I'm going to make a hard left here.
Stick with us, Tom.
Okay.
Lesson learned.
Thank you.
Next.
Andy.
Impressive.
I'm going to engage Andy in an attack hold, and he's going to try and break free.
Cool.
Now, I don't want to hurt you, Ron.
Don't worry about that.
Just try to escape my attack.
Now, when I get out, am I allowed to counter-strike?
Sure.
When you get out, you may counter-attack.
But just promise me you'll be ready, because, I mean, I don't want to destroy you.
Okay.
I see where we're going with this Now, when your arms are pinned to your sides, use your legs to break free, instead of your neck, which is what Andy is trying to do.
Okay, hold up.
Get off!
Let him go.
Andy.
Oh, God.
Oops.
Any of this looking familiar?
Yeah.
It happened right over there.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not surprised.
Take a look at this path.
With budget cuts, we can't afford a single safety light.
There's been 10 assaults already this year.
Wow.
Really?
Can't you station a Park Ranger out here?
We have!
Who do you think they're assaulting?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell.
One way or another, I'm going to get money so you can protect Jerry, and all the other helpless, pathetic people in this town.
You guys have got to slow down.
Can I just take a rest for a minute?
No, Tom.
Sorry.
No can do.
Sun's going down and it's real dangerous out here.
Let's roll, Carl.
Okay.
Going fast.
Okay, what day is it today?
I don't know.
Okay, but to be fair, you never know.
That's kind of true.
I'm super bad at days.
But honestly, I'm fine.
Sorry I squeezed your lights out there, son.
No worries.
Will you show me how to do that move, though?
Sure.
I can teach you right now No, no, no.
Andy, you should really just take it easy, I think.
Do you want some more water?
Or maybe some pancakes?
No.
No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
What is the first move in any fight?
Punch to the balls.
We've all heard the old saying.
"Parks are supposed to be fun".
But sometimes, muggers have their own ideas.
Leslie Knope is with us again from the Parks Department.
Leslie, tell us your story.
This is my co-worker, Jerry Gergich.
Diabetic.
Sloppily out of shape.
Friend.
He was mugged this morning in Ramsett Park.
Who's next?
Your frumpy uncle?
Your simple neighbor?
Your unpopular co-worker?
Head of security, Carl Lorthner, is doing his best to keep the parks safe, but he's failing.
So, what is the solution to fix this?
To make it right.
And not bad.
We need money from City Hall.
And it's not coming through.
And Pawnee, I am sorry to say this, but your government is failing you.
Up next, 10 objects you didn't know you can eat.
What possessed you to do that?
I'm sorry, Paul, but one of my guys got mugged in the park.
I don't care how upset you are.
You do not badmouth your own government on TV.
I'm sure you'll be happy to know your little stunt worked.
The Mayor is going to divert $2500 to the Parks for security upgrades.
There's going to be an announcement tomorrow at 10:00 in the press room.
So Make sure you bring the doofus who got his ass kicked.
I don't know who you're referring to.
We treat everyone with respect around here.
Okay.
Good morning.
As many of you know, there was an incident involving a government employee in Ramsett Park.
Jerry, are you nervous?
Just talk about how hard it was for you.
Speak from the heart.
You'll be fine.
Leslie?
I wasn't mugged.
safety of our citizens.
That's why we're here today to give Pawnee Jerry?
Why don't you step on up here?
No, I will.
Get up here.
I'm going to speak for Jerry.
He can't talk right now because he has hysterical muteness from trauma.
Correct.
Jerry.
What about this?
Is this fake?
Huh?
Is this fake?
This is real.
I really dislocated my shoulder.
Were you even in the park yesterday?
Look, I was on my way to feed the hummingbirds, and I stopped for a breakfast burrito.
The farting.
Yeah.
And Lord Sheldon He lunged at a bird, I dropped the burrito, and it landed on a log in the creek.
So, I go to reach for it, I lose my balance, and I fall on my shoulder really weird.
Well, why didn't you just tell everybody the truth?
Are you kidding me?
Imagine what Tom would have said.
Damn, Jerry!
You jumped in a creek for a burrito?
What would you do for a Klondike Bar?
Kill your wife?
Block the opponent's punch and counter-punch to the jaw.
Shoeshine?
Hey.
Oh!
Hey!
Ann Perkins, in the "shoe-shouse".
I wanted to check in.
I brought some stuff from the hospital.
Water, a compress, aspirin, some lollipops, I know you love those.
Ann, you know, thank you.
But really, I'm feeling great.
I took a couple of aspirin and slept right through the night.
And Hold on a second.
Ludgate.
What the hell?
I got you one of those veggie muffins that you're always eating.
Score.
Yeah.
It tastes like a rug.
Shut up.
Don't hit me.
Good.
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better.
I am.
Thank you for that.
That's so cool.
Since when did he start doing stuff for other people?
Now, I actually am worried that something happened to his brain.
People change, I guess Wouldn't you rather the money go to keeping the parks safe?
Yes, but now, we have the money under false pretenses.
I actually think that you have a bigger problem than the money.
What?
There is someone in your department who is willing to lie about being mugged, because he's afraid of his co-workers.
Knope.
Yep.
No.
Carl.
What are you doing?
Oh, Leslie.
Well, since you decided to drag my name through the mud on TV, I figured why not return the favor.
Carl, could you quietly quiet down for a second, and please tell me what is going on, quietly?
Okay?
In a quiet voice.
A citizen handed in a very interesting home video that I think the people of Pawnee will find very interesting.
Take a peek at this.
Keep your eyes on the creek.
There he is.
This is my favorite part.
Not willing to share with a dog.
So, it would appear that Park Security was not to blame after all.
Okay, look.
I have a proposition for you.
Fine.
I'll have sex with you in exchange for the tape.
That's not what I am saying.
Okay?
Just listen to what I have to say.
The Ramsett Park mugging story continues with a shiny new twist.
Ranger Carl Lorthner is here today.
Now, I understand that you have a bombshell to drop that you are just sitting on.
Yes, that's correct.
I came on today because I have some very important information to share.
I finally saw Avatar and I thought it lived up to the hype.
Well, I'm not sure what that has to do with the mugging.
Uh Leslie.
Counterpoint.
I disagree with Carl.
Okay.
I have seen Avatar as well, and I think it exceeded the hype.
What?
Oh boy, we Disagreement.
Well, things are really heating up in here, aren't they?
We should probably take some calls.
That segment was a disaster.
Don't you ever me like that again.
This is Pawnee Today.
Do you know that I bumped a cat that can stand up on its hinders for you?
You disgust me, Knope.
Get out of my sight.
Yes, ma'am.
Go.
Go on.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't make me chase you.
You want to go eat something?
Okay.
I am part of a great team.
And sometimes, the best way to maintain a strong team is just by letting someone know that he is still a part of it.
This is the only copy, and I am going to destroy it.
Right after I watch it one more time.
I'm sorry, but it is so good.
Hey, Jerry.
Hmm.
I got you a peppermint latte.
Seriously?
My goodness.
I love a peppermint I know.
Oh, geez.
Go ahead.
We should just directly apply the food to your clothes.
Making fun of Jerry is back!
They can laugh at me all they want.
Because two more years until I retire with full benefits and pension.
And the wife and I, we have bought a little cottage on a lake.
And I am going to get myself a stack of mystery novels, a box of cigars, and I am going to sit back and enjoy my life.
Hey, Jerry?
April was just double-checking the lunch order.
Do you want the salmon or the "twout"?
Twout!
Twout!
Twout!
Twout!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Good morning.
Whoo!
Swiss Family Ron-binson!
That hat is dope.
Thanks, Tom.
You mind if I rock that bad Larry on my dome?
Wear it on my head?
Try it on the ladies?
Be my guest.
Hi, I'm Tom.
I have a raccoon on my head.
Excuse me?
My friend over here was digging through your trash and I think we may have a lot in common.
I'm Tom.
Would you like to see a movie sometime?
Are you a raccoon?
Because you've been running around my hat all day Head all day.
Girl, you're more precious than Precious.
Uh-uh.
"Nice hat.
Wanna bone"?
That's you, talking to me.
No.
How about, "Yes, I am a hunter, and it's you season".
Whoa, that's great.
I gotta get back out there.
You know what they say, animal on the head, manimal in the bed.
Damn, girl!
Your hotness killed my raccoon!
I have a raccoon hat.
I'm an interesting person.
Hello!
Any luck?
Nope.
Didn't work out as well as I thought it would.
Well, better luck next time.
I tried.
It just didn't seem like Wow.
I love that hat.
Thank you, ma'am.
Hey, Ron.
I have a surprise for you.
Meet me at Harvey James Park at 11:30.
Why?
It's a surprise!
What's the surprise?
If I told you, it would ruin the surprise.
What's the surprise it would ruin?
I cannot tell you that.
Leslie, my first wife, Tammy, tried throwing me a surprise birthday party.
When I saw my friends hiding through the window, I drove to a gas station, called the cops and told them people had broken into my home.
I'm not big on surprises.
Okay, but you're gonna like this one.
What is it?
I'm not telling you.
And I'm not gonna tell anybody!
Okay.
I'll tell you.
We're putting together the Parks Department Summer Catalog.
And the big surprise is I am going to reunite all the living former Parks Directors at a picnic, record the whole thing, and then write about it in the "Welcome Letter".
It's the biggest catalog of the year.
Think of the September issue of Vogue.
But it's more important to Pawnee.
Mainly because we don't get Vogue here.
I'm gonna move this "Yearning" ad to the centerfold.
Centerfold, always the best part.
Am I right, Justin?
Damn, they broke up six weeks ago.
Yeah.
Jerry, I need to see your softball pictures.
Here you go, Chief.
Wow, good job.
Nice work.
Whoa!
Wait a minute.
Isn't that that creepy guy?
Morgan?
The pedophile?
Yeah, it is.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Jerry!
Come on!
I didn't know that!
He seemed okay.
We had dinner together.
Guys, I don't know if I made it clear, but I don't want any sex offenders in our Parks catalog.
Okay, I will Photoshop his face.
Can you Photoshop your life with better decisions, Jerry?
Okay, April.
Enough.
Cover photo.
Tom, you're up.
This catalog is basically, like, an ad for the Parks Department, and I love ads.
I love magazine ads for flavored vodkas, billboards for designer jeans.
I TiVo through shows to get to the ads.
I love ads.
What are we trying to do with this catalog?
We're trying to sell Pawnee on our summer classes.
How do we do that?
With one perfect, captivating image.
April?
Modern life.
Where are we running?
Sometimes, what we want is not always where we are.
Next slide.
Are we alone?
Is the real winter inside our hearts?
We are all struggling for definition in a world that resists our inquiries.
Okay, this isn't gonna work for a number of reasons.
One, this is a summer catalog.
Two, that was complete gibberish.
And three, that child looks like it's abandoned.
So, basically, boo.
Next slide.
Oh, God.
Weird.
How did that That's a personal photo.
That's Shouldn't be This must've You know, I gotta say, I think that could actually work as our cover photo.
I'm cool with it, if you guys are.
It's a high-res photo.
I don't know if I have time for this, guys, so, let's just pick a good photo, okay?
What do you want, Leslie?
A picture of parents pushing a kid on a swing?
Yeah.
Exactly.
Get me that.
Okay.
I gotta go.
What is he thinking?
"Why is my cup so tiny"?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Happy six-month anniversary.
I got you a gift.
It's a chicken salad sandwich.
And I don't want you to feel bad about not getting me anything, because I would never expect Swiss Army Watch, mofo.
Well done.
Perkins.
Wow!
You like it?
Thank you so much.
That's so nice.
Are you allowed to kiss me in a hospital room?
Oh, don't worry about it.
He's dead.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no, I'm just kidding, he's sleeping.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, our relationship is going well.
Really well.
That guy really seemed dead.
Nice!
Here, catch this.
You got me in the face!
Oh!
That one hurt.
You've a good arm.
I know.
I used to play softball in high school.
Shut up!
I played baseball in high school.
Shut up!
Yeah, that's like, the boy version of softball.
Guys, don't play with the food, okay?
We need this for the picnic.
Do we have everything?
Yes, ma'am.
Three picnic baskets, assorted cheeses, grapes, wine.
Smoked salmon?
April threw the smoked salmon on the roof.
I'm sorry.
Where's Leslie?
She just texted me from your phone and said she left her phone at home and that I should come here immediately.
And why did I believe that?
Maybe in your heart you knew it was from me, but you came anyway.
Nope.
Tom, would you please stop texting me that you're having a city planning emergency?
There's no such thing as a city planning emergency.
Hi, there.
Hi.
Look at you two.
Ann Perkins, Mark Brendanawicz.
"Anndanawicz".
Or "Merkins".
No, "Anndanawicz".
You two should be models.
Maybe on the cover of the Parks Department Summer Catalog?
That's not the reason you called me in here, right?
'Cause I just finished a 12-hour shift.
If that's the reason Come on, Ann.
It'd be a huge favor for Leslie.
You know how important this is to her.
Well, I am in.
Dude!
I am.
We don't have any pictures of just the two of us.
Plus, I've always said we should go on more dates with Tom.
Yeah, you have.
And thank God an opportunity presented itself.
See?
Win-win.
Now, Ann, you're gonna change, right?
I guess.
Would it kill you to maybe put on some lipstick?
Do you even own lipstick?
This is probably the first time in history these four great men have been in the same place at the same time.
It kind of makes you What is this?
Sweater swap!
She noticed!
You were right.
Oh, my God.
Somebody's here.
Okay.
Guys, just act normal.
Please?
Just be like normal people.
Hello!
Hi!
David Moser!
I'm Leslie Knope.
It is such an honor to meet you.
Right.
How long is this gonna take?
Oh, not very long.
I realize, of course, you're a very busy man.
I love parks.
I don't know if that's something I've communicated before.
So, having a picnic with all the former living Parks Department Directors Guess who just checked something off her bucket list?
Clarence Carrington, David Moser, Michael Tansley, Ron Swanson, gathered together on a beautiful day in this beautiful park.
I think we should just take a moment and appreciate how lucky we are.
I thought you were dead, Clarence.
No.
I'm gonna outlive you, then I'm gonna nail your wife.
Screw you, you old coot.
Classic David.
You're worse than Ron.
Shut your damn mouth, Tansley.
Okay!
Great!
Let's go!
When I say "parks," you say "department"!
Parks!
Parks!
Apartment!
Oh, boy.
This is taking a lot longer than I thought it would.
Can you guys run up ahead and set up the picnic?
Sure.
Oh.
Where are they going with the food?
I'm starving.
I only had one breakfast.
Okay, relax.
Look, what was going on back there?
Why all the sniping?
Not exactly sure.
The only one I know is Michael, and we're not exactly best friends.
Hmm.
I'm hungry.
Okay, well, don't be such a baby.
I cooked you some bacon for a trail snack.
I ate it already.
What?
I could smell it in your purse before I even parked my car.
And now it's gone.
And I hate everything.
Good, good, good.
All right.
I think we got the boring clichéd shot that Leslie wanted.
That's it?
We're done?
Not even close.
Now the real art begins.
Step one, nail this photo shoot with an amazing, iconic image.
Step two, book some outside gigs.
Step three, have sex with a model.
Step four, step in front of the camera, become a model.
Go, yes!
Keep slithering!
Keep slithering!
Ann, can you give me something, anything, in the face?
What do you want me to do?
Do what Mark's doing.
He's doing great!
Keep slithering!
I'm not doing anything, so Okay, Clarence, um, why don't you describe the first Summer Pawnee Catalog.
I remember.
That first year we offered four classes.
I actually taught Homemaking.
Women were not allowed to teach back then.
Really?
I thought there were female teachers way before then.
Not in my department.
Well, times have changed.
I'm Deputy Director now, but I'm hoping someday to be the first female director of the department.
Oh, I don't think that's a good idea.
Women need a lot of blood to flow through to their baby centers, which leaves less to the brain, you see.
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
Sure.
I'd stay away from leadership roles, for your own safety.
No!
No!
Maybe I should write a song about a picnic.
Ooh, where'd you come up with that idea?
The picnic we're having.
I already have the perfect title, Life is a Picnic.
That's good.
How about Life is a Picnic with You?
Whoa!
Then it could be about a girl.
Or Peyton Manning!
Hmm.
You wanna help me write the lyrics?
Yeah, totally.
We should grab a drink after this at Tucker's.
Yeah, I would do that.
That sounds fun.
I just have to get my stuff from the office.
But that's That'd be cool.
David, what was it exactly that called you to the Parks Department?
Well, I was in Public Works for eight years.
But the director was pretty young.
Clarence was old and weak.
So, I put in for a transfer, swooped in and pushed him out.
There was no other reason you wanted the job?
No.
Just the money and the pension.
The actual job's a nightmare.
I mean, who gives a crap about this crap.
Well, David, I think we've talked enough.
Mark, that's great.
Bobby, great.
Ann, you look miserable!
Terrible.
Terrible!
Come on, Ann.
What are we doing?
Maxim or Good Housekeeping?
I'm not sure which one is the insult.
Hey, if there's anyone out there that's doing a photo shoot about the dangers of eating undercooked chicken, I can give you Ann's phone number.
Okay, let's stop for a second.
Bobby, I love how you work.
Yay!
You can have as many juice boxes as you want.
In fact, grab me one, too.
Make it an apple.
Mark, great job, you can have a juice box, too.
Ann, take a walk with me.
In a million years, I never thought you would be the problem with this photo shoot.
Didn't you just plan this, like, two hours ago?
I just don't get it.
How could someone so hot be so bad at looking hot?
I'm sorry I'm not a professional model.
And screaming, "Make your face better!
" doesn't help.
Well, I'm sorry, your face just isn't working.
And we need to do something to distract from this boring area.
Now, I didn't want to have to do this, but we may have to go nude.
Goodbye, Tom!
Fair enough.
I totally understand.
But we should get one for safety.
Okay, guys.
We're almost there.
It's right up here.
You really shouldn't be leading us.
If you're menstruating, you'll attract bears.
Holy God.
Okay.
Here we are.
Eat.
Well, it hasn't gone exactly as I've hoped.
But I got them all here and we're gonna have a beautiful picnic.
It's gonna It's gonna be good.
Hey.
I just whizzed on a butterfly!
Well, gentlemen, as you know, I'm working on my welcome letter for the Summer Catalog.
You should just copy the Eagleton one.
I used to just copy the Eagleton one.
Did you?
I was hoping that maybe you could talk to me a little bit about how the department has changed since you ran it.
Well, I think you've done a wonderful job maintaining the parks.
Thank you, Michael.
I appreciate that.
Did you enjoy your turn at the helm?
Oh, in a way.
Pencil pushing wasn't really my thing, but I did love the parks themselves.
That was the best part of the job.
Oh, isn't it?
I totally agree.
Well, thank goodness for you.
Yes, thank goodness for Michael.
Are you still on parole, by the way?
Oh, ha, ha.
Very funny, Ron.
Yes.
Yes, Ron, I am.
What?
He smoked pot.
In the office.
And in all the parks.
Constantly.
In fairness to me, it was a different time.
It was the early '90s.
But also, it's ridiculous that marijuana is illegal.
Thomas Jefferson grew hemp.
Alcohol is legal, but pot isn't?
That makes sense to you, Ron?
I'm sorry, I can't hear hippies.
So, if you had to sleep with one of the old guys, who would it be?
The super-old one.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
I'm an eyebrow girl.
I wanna make out with him and chew his eyebrows off.
That is really gross.
Anybody got any water?
I want water.
I'm so old, I need to drink water.
Oh, stop it, stop taunting him.
I don't need your help, jailbird.
If there's any unclaimed meat or cheese, I would like to claim it.
Yeah.
Like you claimed my job?
Yes.
Exactly like that, in that I wanted it, and then I took it.
Okay, guys, you know what I would love?
I would love if anybody just said something positive about, oh, I don't know, anything.
I agree.
Let's just relax, smoke another J, and all calm down.
Another?
By the way, it's ridiculous that pot is illegal.
It grows in the ground!
I've planted marijuana in community gardens all over the city, and it hasn't hurt anyone!
What?
You know, Michael?
You are one pot-loving mother pain in the rectum.
Okay, stop it!
Stop it!
You're all being awful, horrible men!
Uh-oh.
Your little friend come to visit?
Clarence, if you mention anything about women, or menstruation, or anything, I'm gonna take your face and I'm gonna shove it in those brambles.
Yes!
No!
You're next, buddy.
Andy!
Let's take this picture.
Come on!
Get out of your seats, turds.
What?
Line up over there.
Come on.
Just please try to look human.
All right, and not so evil.
Everybody looking here.
One, two, three.
Thank you so much for the wonderful memories.
Everybody take their stuff and go.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Can we do one funny-face one?
Do you have that picture that Andy took?
Maybe I'll run it without any text.
Yeah.
I tried to Photoshop it to make it look like they were happy.
It was really hard.
Their mouths are so old.
God!
Look at these horrible men.
You know, I don't even know if I want them in my catalog.
Would you like these men in your catalog?
Oh, my God, April.
That's disgusting.
What?
Look how generous they're being with each other.
And here's the "Obstruction" series.
What do you think?
Amazing, right?
I call this one "The Future".
It's completely blurry.
Yes, it is, Ann.
What about the ones we took on the swing?
The normal ones?
You mean the "Unhappy Wife" photos?
Oh, my God.
These are even worse, somehow.
I look miserable.
You do look kind of miserable.
Now you know what I meant by, "Make your face better".
Was there something wrong, Ann?
Well, I had just gotten off a long shift.
He was being really annoying.
Mark looks happy.
Just please don't use these, okay?
Let's grab some dinner.
Sure.
Hey, Ron.
You want me to read you what I have so far in my welcome letter?
Nothing.
Because you and your jerk predecessors didn't give me anything to work with.
Did you print this out?
I heard the printer going.
Yes.
You could've just handed me a blank piece of paper.
Oh!
Wisdom!
Finally.
Thank you so much.
You can also keep the photo.
Thanks for the memories.
Good God.
I don't remember this.
That That's the wrong one.
But the real one's very bad as well.
I want you to know that I'm replacing the "Welcome Letter" with this ad for Yearning by Dennis Feinstein.
So goodbye, distilled wisdom of 50 years of experience.
Hello, disgusting fragrance flap.
Let me buy you dinner.
No.
I insist you buy me dinner.
Get a drink.
Whatever.
It's cool.
Okay.
ID.
I'm 24.
No, you're not.
Okay, I'm 25.
No old jokes, please.
ID.
It says right here you're 20.
You're not even gonna show me a fake?
Sometimes the confidence confuses people.
You're good, bro.
You know what?
I think I'll just I'm gonna Hey, I know another bar that always lets me in, if you just wanna go there.
Uh Yeah, actually, I should get going home.
I have a lot of stuff to do.
So, I should go home.
Clean and stuff.
But Yeah, okay, cool.
Yeah, I gotta go home, too.
So All right.
See you!
Later.
The usual, Marta.
Me, too, Marta.
You got it.
Oh, Ron, I really made love to the pooch on this one.
Screwed the pooch?
I don't like that term.
It's so vulgar.
Ron!
That sucked, today.
I'm sorry.
There's no other way to say it.
They're a bunch of career bureaucrats.
What did you think they were gonna say to you?
"Leslie, you are the next link in a wonderful chain "that stretches back to when our town was founded, "and we believe in you and we support you "and we'll be following your career.
"You are the chosen one".
Or something.
Well, okay, so, that was the problem.
No.
You know what the worst part is is I wanna be Parks Director.
But every single person who was Parks Director hated their job and hated everyone they worked with.
Are we gonna hate each other someday?
I don't think so.
I think we're gonna be fine.
Anyway, the point's moot, because you're Park Director now and you're not going anywhere and I'm not making you go anywhere.
I'm not gonna stab you in the back or anything, so Maybe I should go somewhere.
Maybe I should move, to Eagleton.
Oh, God, the thought of that.
Leslie, you don't have to move to Eagleton.
When I become City Manager, my job is yours.
Of course, my first act as City Manager will be to propose eliminating the Parks Department.
Although I expect a spirited debate with Leslie.
Who knows what the future holds for me?
Maybe I'll leapfrog Ron's job and become City Manager.
Of course, my first act as City Manager would be to double the size of the Parks Department.
Although, I do expect a fight from Ron.
But I'll win.
Mmm!
Thank you, darling.
Why would anybody ever eat anything besides breakfast food?
People are idiots, Leslie.
The wait is over!
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
Look what's here.
We got "My fellow Pawneeans Yes, it's here!
"The Parks Department's Summer Catalog has arrived "and for the first time in 20 years, tennis is back!
"Peruse this wondrous book at your leisure "and take advantage of everything this great town has to offer.
"Time is fleeting, my fellow Pawneeans.
"Make the most of it, while you can.
"I recently had the honor of spending an afternoon "with every living former Parks Director, "and they taught me a valuable lesson, "there is nothing more important than friendship".
It's a little flowery.
Shut up.
I gotta hand it to Michael.
His water-pipe-making skills were most impressive.
I once saw him smoke pot out of a 20-foot length of garden hose and a milk jug.
That guy made a water pipe out of a stuffed raccoon.
No way.
No, I'm not kidding.
He made a bong out of a taxidermied raccoon?
I caught him smoking pot out of it not three feet from where we're standing.
Oh, nice shot.
Right in Clarence's ancient junk.
In the neck!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Leslie, can I run something by you really quick?
Sure!
I love having things run by me.
I feel like you're being sarcastic right now.
No, no.
I'm not.
I genuinely love it.
Run it by me.
Go ahead!
Go, go, go.
Okay, so I've been a little worried that Ann maybe thinks that our relationship isn't moving forward fast enough.
And so I'm wondering if maybe I should ask her if she would like to move in with me.
Good idea?
Bad idea?
You tell me.
I would say that some women won't consider moving in with someone unless they think marriage is in the future, which I know, for you is I intend to marry her.
For realskies?
I'm not really quite sure how I feel.
I It's a little weird.
I mean, I'm happy for them.
They're my friends.
It makes me a little nauseous.
If I could just sum it up in one word, it would be Parks and Rec.
Confirming what?
That's not possible.
Oh, no!
Hey!
Good morning.
Why are there six people outside who say they're waiting to meet with me?
So, you know how you love me because you haven't had a single meeting with anyone since I became your assistant?
That's because every time someone calls and requests a meeting with you, I always schedule it for March 31st.
Why?
Because I didn't think March 31st existed.
Thirty days has September, April, March and November June and November.
Today is March 31st.
I know.
So, then, how many meetings do I have today?
Ninety-three.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, you know what to do.
Right.
To me, this situation is a blood-soaked, nightmarish hellscape.
However, to Leslie Knope Oh, how fun!
Yay!
Why don't you take as many as you can, and I'll cover the rest.
I have a better idea.
Why don't I try to rustle up seven more meetings, 'cause I think it would be cooler if there were an even 100 Just Why don't we just stick to these 93 and see how it goes?
Yeah, okay.
This is the perfect distraction for me.
Okay, so I have everything I need, right?
I have a fresh cup of coffee, comfy fur-lined boots.
I'm gonna need those boots back by the end of the day.
Yeah, no problem.
They're actually a little narrow for me.
Leslie, here's a guy.
Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, Deputy Director.
Bill Haggerty, Pawnee Historical Society.
I'm supposed to be meeting with Ron Swanson.
I understand that.
He's tied up right now.
What a shocker.
I've been trying to meet with him for three months, and now he's not available.
It's probably too late now, but, some rich woman, Jessica Wicks, has rented out Turnbill Mansion for a party, and she's making alterations.
"Alterations"?
Turnbill Mansion is one of the most beloved historical sites in Pawnee.
In 1867, the progressive Reverend Turnbill officiated a wedding between a white woman and a Wamapoke Indian chief.
The secret ceremony was beautiful and romantic.
But then word got out, and the reception was a bloodbath.
Fortunately, there were two survivors.
Unfortunately, they were both horses.
Hold up.
Former beauty queen Jessica Wicks?
Yes.
I'm Tom Haverford.
I'm gonna be running point on this, Bill.
Hey, why didn't you try to stop her?
Her husband is Nick Newport Sr. From Sweetums.
Everyone in this town is afraid to say no to him.
Okay, everybody just relax.
What alterations is she trying to make?
Drilling holes, painting, removing wainscoting, she's tearing down the gazebo What?
She's what?
No, she's not.
Okay.
Tom, go get the car.
Ow!
Sorry.
Don't throw things at me.
God, these are tight!
I'll devise an action plan to help us coordinate better among the departments.
Will you?
Great.
Thanks for coming in.
Yeah.
Who's next?
Tom, I'll meet you at the car.
Where the hell are you going?
We have 91 more meetings!
I'm sorry, Ron, as much as I would like to go for the "all-time City Hall single day meetings record," there is an emergency.
Someone is trying to alter a gazebo.
Hey.
Oh, hey, Ann.
Sorry I can't hang out.
I kind of have an emergency.
Oh, I'm actually here to see Mark.
Right.
Well, thanks for the coffee.
That's also for Mark.
I really need it, though.
But next time more sugar, okay?
Thanks, bye.
Do you want me to postpone the rest?
Or I could set myself on fire and create a diversion?
No.
I'm gonna do all of these today.
Round up whoever's free.
I'm gonna need more Ron Swansons.
Look at that.
It's gorgeous.
What kind of monster would wanna change this?
Pre-zit.
Do you have any brown concealer by any chance?
I need to look good for Jessica.
You know, they may be rich, but they can't just destroy history.
Let's go.
I'm right behind you.
I just need to spend a minute in my cologne cloud.
What is that?
Attack by Dennis Feinstein.
When you wanna attack the senses of the lady you wanna bed.
Oh, my God!
Door!
Door!
Door, door!
Close it!
So basically, we're completely swamped.
All hands on deck.
I don't even work in this building.
Don't care.
I need anyone with a pulse and a brain to pitch in.
Ron, do you need help with anything?
No, we're good.
Thanks.
In fact, you can head home early.
Right, now the four of us are gonna divvy up all these meetings.
Just make them feel like they've been heard.
Understood?
Yes, sir.
Bert Macklin, FBI, on the case.
April, you take Leslie's office.
Andy, you're in the conference room.
Ann, take your meetings in the courtyard.
Just sit there and don't ruin the city.
Dismissed.
What are you doing?
Can I get a badge?
Hey, I brought you a coffee, help you get through the day.
Thanks, dude!
No problem, lady!
I'm gonna go.
Okay.
April is the best but she's 20.
When April was born, I was already in third grade, which means if we were friends back then, I'd have been hanging out with a baby.
I don't know anything about infant care.
My God, I could have killed her!
Ah, Mr. Newport Sr. I've just been informed that you plan on altering this mansion.
And as a member of the Parks Department, as a Pawneean and an American, I ask you to refrain from harming this historic structure.
What?
I'll take care of this, love nut.
Biscuit.
Yeah.
Hi, I'm Jessica Wicks, Miss Pawnee 1994.
Hello, yes.
We've met before.
We were both judges at the pageant last year.
Leslie Knorp.
Of course!
How are you?
Jessica Wicks.
Hey, boo!
Are you aging in reverse?
'Cause you look barely legal.
Tom Haverford.
If you're not the most charming man in Indiana.
And this must be the luckiest man in Indiana.
Sir, it is an honor to meet you.
Come here, you!
Tell me straight, are you a Chinese?
No!
I'm one of the Indian people.
That floppy old bag of money is gonna be dead in like a month.
And who's going to comfort Jessica and her millions of dollars?
Yeah, Jessica is a gold-digger.
But I'm a gold-digger-digger.
So, how did you and Mr. Newport meet?
I was doing a ribbon-cutting at the hospital, and he was there because his blood doesn't work.
And we started talking, and then I realized who he was.
Oh, my gosh!
It was love at first sight!
Oh, that sounds so romantic.
Um, Jessica, I know you've rented out this house for a party.
But it's on the historical register, so we can't allow any changes.
I'm so sorry.
It's a little late for that, sweetheart.
I told them what I was doing months ago.
Where I come from, there's a saying, "What's done is done".
That's a saying everywhere.
I've never heard it before and I think it's a great saying.
Well, maybe we can just limit the damage.
How much have you done?
You painted this?
Uh-huh.
Miami Teal is Nicky's favorite color.
We also replaced some of the sconces, got rid of the furniture, painted these floors black Oh, no.
These were the original hardwood floors.
Yeah.
They were all scratched up.
I did you a favor.
Come on in here.
I'll show you guys what we did in the sitting room.
I can't After you.
I'd hate to miss the view.
You little devil.
I should just pay you to follow me around.
If that's a job offer, I accept.
Oh, my God!
Why did you have to drill holes in the wall?
To hang my birthday present to Nicky.
My heavens!
Isn't there a way that you could've Oh, my!
History is important.
You just can't go around changing everything all of the time.
Or else next thing you know, they'll be painting the White House not white.
I'm so angry, I can't think of another color.
Green.
So, your department banned me from attending games just because I yell "you suck" at the players!
According to the complaint, you yelled it at five-year-old girls.
Who suck!
Why is that so hard to understand?
I thought I was having this meeting with Ron Swanson.
I'm afraid that Ron Swanson's currently dead.
Oh.
I'm his daughter, April Swanson.
And it's his last wish that I have this meeting with you.
I represent the Ultimate Frisbee league.
And Pawnee has an Ultimate league?
Yes, and we keep running into conflicts with You won me over.
I will join your team.
I'm sorry, what we need When does practice start?
And do you provide the jerseys?
What color are the jerseys, by the way?
What's our team name?
Are we the Lightning?
Now, I have to tell you, I don't actually work in the Parks Department.
I'm a nurse.
Seriously?
That's great news.
I have the weirdest thing on my arm.
Can you see this?
Every time.
Oh, thank God you haven't torn down the gazebo yet.
Don't remind me.
The demolition people couldn't get here until this afternoon.
I've had to look at that ugly thing all day long.
Ugly thing?
Let me tell you a little something about this "ugly thing," ma'am.
A hundred and fifty years ago, an interracial couple was married here, and then slaughtered by their own families.
It's one of the most beautiful stories in Pawnee's history.
Why are you trying to destroy it?
Don't tell me about Pawnee history.
The Newports made this town.
And tonight, we're gonna celebrate my husband's 85th birthday, without this mushy old pile of rot.
Your husband's a mushy old pile of rot.
You were a stick-in-the-mud when we judged that beauty pageant, and you're being a stick-in-the-mud now.
I am not a stick-in-the-mud!
I just want to stop a party from happening.
Ron?
I have a gazebo update, so ignore all my previous voicemails and e-mails.
Leslie, I haven't relieved myself in five hours, so, if you'll excuse me.
Ron, I'm sorry, but this can't wait.
Jessica Wicks refuses to Leslie, what the Hey!
Miss Knope?
Councilman Howser!
Nice to see you again.
Not that I saw anything, other than your face, and I would like to talk to you a little bit about this gazebo thing.
You know, the problem Okay, okay.
Enough of this.
Do whatever you want.
Alert the media.
Call FEMA, I don't care.
Do not bother me with this again.
Miss Knope.
Councilman Howser.
I saw your penis.
There are eight swings at Ramsett Park and every single one of them is broken.
Can you please just fix one of them?
Ron told me I can't say yes to anything.
But it's such a reasonable request.
I can't just say no.
So, that's a yes?
Are you saying yes?
Just say out loud, yes or no.
Boop!
Yeah, they do look a little bit swollen.
Just follow the pen.
Follow the pen to Does that hurt?
There's no way this ordinance goes through.
There's too much red tape.
Mmm.
This gridlock drives me nuts.
Tell me about it.
Yeah.
I think you're gonna have to make an end run.
You know?
Go right to the Commissioner on this one.
You know what, I hadn't thought of that.
That is a really great idea.
Yeah?
I'm gonna do that.
Okay.
Your last resort is probably gonna be City Council.
Good luck there!
Yeah!
My thoughts exactly.
I have no idea what I was saying.
I ask you.
Is this too revealing for a public pool?
Kindly get your groin off my desk.
So my body makes you uncomfortable, too?
Hey, Mark.
I'm kind of freaking out about this historical mansion thing.
Can I talk to you for a second?
I'm actually headed right out the door.
You're going on a date with Ann.
Yeah.
I was gonna surprise her, take her to a nice restaurant.
Don't worry about it.
Are you sure now?
Yeah, have a good time.
How we doing?
Pretty good.
I may have promised a new aquatic center to somebody.
Is that a problem?
I diagnosed two melanomas.
They're both benign.
How many more meetings?
Twenty.
April was supposed to be the moat that kept the citizen barbarians away from Swanson Castle.
Instead she blew up the castle and stabbed me in the face.
I hired you to do one thing.
Just one.
I don't care that you text all day and sleep at your desk.
In fact, I encourage it.
But only because you were doing that one thing.
Keeping this crap off my desk.
Give me five minutes before the next one.
That guy is scary when he's angry.
Yeah!
God, I know.
Hey.
Sorry, dude.
I don't need your sympathy.
Or yours.
I wasn't offering my sympathy.
Thank you for meeting me here.
Sure.
What's up?
Okay.
I need you to get this word for word.
It's a tape recorder.
So it will.
"Gazebo"?
More like "Ga-zoinks-bo".
She may be a former beauty queen, but today she's the king of destroying history!
Okay, could you just maybe talk normally?
Okay, fine.
"Ga-zoinks-bo".
Jessica Wicks is throwing a birthday party for her husband Nick Newport Sr. At the Turnbill Mansion tonight Okay.
I'm gonna stop you right there.
Nick Newport Sr. Is the former CEO of Sweetums.
So?
Sweetums owns The Pawnee Journal.
Crap on the cob!
I will take it into consideration.
Thank God!
That was it, right?
No.
There's one more.
Damn it to hell!
It's with me and it's right now and it's about me quitting.
I quit.
I have no other choice, okay?
This is the only rational way I know to prevent this tragedy.
Oh, my God!
Here they come.
Tom, throw away the key!
Seriously?
Yes!
Throw it!
Out of the way!
Sir, I'm sorry, but you're a little late.
So, you're gonna have to turn this thing around, 'cause you're not getting in here.
Oh, God!
Tom!
Stop him!
Jump in front of it!
Sacrifice your tiny body!
I really thought that gate would open in the middle.
Well, the gazebo has been destroyed.
And the thing that bothers me the most Cut it out, Tom.
It never gets old.
Hey, Ann and Mark are coming.
Guys, not so close.
You're gonna You're gonna Don't go past the sensor.
Sensor?
Sorry if I ruined your evening.
Leslie, it's totally fine.
I chained myself to a gate.
I can see that.
Are you okay?
Nothing's bruised but my ego.
And my arm, a little, from the mechanized gate.
Thanks again for letting me take those meetings today.
I've never really had a meeting before.
They're awesome.
You're welcome.
Hey, have you seen April around?
She usually comes by at the end of the day.
You might want to check her house.
She quit on me.
What?
Why?
She screwed up my entire life today.
That was one mistake.
She's perfect for you.
Come on, there's no one in the world who's gonna do a better job for you than April.
Either you hire her back or I quit.
You don't work for me.
And I never will, sir.
Good day.
So what'd you guys talk about at dinner?
Huh?
Was it fun?
Any big decisions arrived at?
It was fine.
Do you need a ride home?
No, Tom's gonna take me.
You guys go on ahead.
I'm glad you're okay.
Call me tomorrow?
Bye, Leslie.
Well, hello there.
You must be Ron Swanson.
Well, welcome to Casa Ludgate!
Hello, Mr. Ludgate.
Call me Larry.
Larry, who is it?
It's Zuzu's boss.
Oh, Ron.
Rita Ludgate.
Oh, you have no idea how nice it is to meet you.
Come in, for gosh sake.
What can I get you to drink?
Ooh.
Could you take your shoes off, please?
Thank you so much.
Nothing to drink, thanks.
Oh, okay.
Is April around?
Zuzu, you have a guest.
I'll fetch her.
She's probably on the Internet again!
I'll come with you.
Okay.
Okay.
You make yourself at home, Mr. Swanson.
Thank you.
You must be April's sister.
I'm Ron.
Nice to meet you.
No offense, but I think the normal grieving time for gazebo destruction has passed.
Yeah, well, maybe that's not entirely what I'm upset about.
Mark and Ann are gonna get married.
Really?
Why does that bother you?
I should be the one that's upset.
It was supposed to be me and Ann.
Or me and Jessica.
Or Ann and Jessica with me watching.
Every time a couple gets married, two single people die.
I'm about to lose two good friends.
Come on.
They drove over here and cut you down from a gate.
I really don't think you have to worry about them abandoning you once they get married.
Yeah, yeah, I know that.
In my brain.
Can we go?
Yeah.
Let's go.
I just need to Come on.
No!
do one more thing.
No, no, no!
Loving smiles and smiling tears The midnight of my heart is you Okay, I'm sorry, everyone.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, but I need to say something.
Is that Gate Lady?
I know you're probably thinking, "There's that crazy gate lady from outside back again".
And to some extent, you're right.
I am the gate lady.
But the only thing I'm crazy about is leaving the past behind.
So, I would like to apologize and raise a glass to change and forgiveness and the future and Ann and Mark, and happiness and Nick Newport Sr. May all your future gazebos live long and prosper.
Please leave!
Is it weird if I ask to take a piece of cake with me?
I won't.
Go.
Why are you here?
Come back to work.
No.
Come back.
I want you to come back.
Well, I don't want to come back.
The end.
I was talking to Andy about you, and he made me realize that I need you back at work.
What did he say?
Don't recall.
Fine, I'll come back.
Good.
Okay, I'm leaving.
Bye, Zuzu.
Bye, Duke Silvers.
My mom has all your albums.
I recognized you the day we met.
Have you told anyone?
No.
Good girl.
Well, excuse me.
I had a meeting with Ron Swanson yesterday, but had a little car trouble.
Sorry, he's busy right now.
Well, can I reschedule?
Sure.
Hmm.
How about June 50th?
Sorry?
Do you think you could come back today at 2:65?
He's available then.
What is going on?
Looks like the only other day he has open is Marchtember One-Teenth.
Does that work, sir?
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hi, there.
What's going on here?
Puppy!
A puppy is here!
Can we keep him?
My neighbor's dog had a litter.
They're looking for people to adopt.
I love him.
I wish he had tiny puppy shoes.
I would totally shine his little shoes for free.
I do say the cutest stuff.
Look, I love a good dog as much as the next guy, but this building doesn't allow animals.
Andy, take him outside.
What, and shoot him?
No.
Just keep him outside.
Oh, come on, Ron.
I'm just a little puppy.
I ain't done nothing wrong.
I'm just a puppy.
I like your mustache.
I wish I could have one.
But I can't.
Because I'm just a little puppy.
Okay, take him out and shoot him.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
What?
Where?
In my belly.
Because the 24-hour Pawnee Cares Diabetes Telethon starts tonight.
Goody.
Let us know how it went.
Every year, Pawnee Cares teams up with the local cable access station to raise money for diabetes research.
And it's important, because Pawnee is the fourth-fattest town in the U.S.
It goes us, Dallas, Tulsa and certain parts of The Mall of America.
Well, this year, I get to program my own four-hour block.
I know.
Exciting!
So, I have signed you all up for multiple shifts.
Yes, just to answer phones and provide moral support.
From when to when?
Tonight.
From 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. What?
No.
Leslie, please.
Tonight's kind of a big night.
You know, all my kids are away, and Gross!
No!
It's Jerry's sex night.
That ruins sex and tonight.
Why don't you put on one of these T-shirts?
It will get you in the mood.
I stayed up all night last night making these.
You stayed up all night the night before an all-night telethon.
Yes.
And here's why.
Boom.
"Diabetes.
Let's Dia-beat-this".
Yeah.
Four hours to come up with the slogan.
Four hours to embroider them.
Time well spent.
Salad sucks.
There.
I said it.
Feel better?
Yep.
I've been doing some thinking.
I'm not going to ask Ann to move in with me.
Why?
Is something wrong?
No.
I'm going to ask her to marry me.
I love her.
And I want a partner.
Horseback.
You should ask her on horseback.
What?
No, you should ask her in a hot air balloon.
No.
She should be on the hot air balloon, and you should ride up on horseback.
Oh.
Wait.
She's in the balloon, you ride up on horseback, you point to the sky, up there, skywriting, "Marry me, Ann".
I think I can figure out the right way to ask her.
How you ask someone to marry you is a very big deal.
I mean, they have to repeat that story for the rest of their lives.
So, you think I should do it, though.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Definitely.
Can you get five eagles?
No, get ten eagles.
Leslie.
No, you're right.
It's your life.
Get as many eagles as you want.
So, Tom, you're in for tonight, right?
I forgot to tell you.
I can't make it to the telethon tonight, because I have no interest in being there.
Okay.
You're in charge of the VIP special telethon guest.
You're never going to believe who I got.
People are going to freak out.
Rihanna.
No.
Dr. Oz.
Nope.
You're never going to guess.
Justin Bieber.
No.
Ex-lndiana Pacers small forward, Detlef Schrempf.
The Detlef Schrempf?
I know!
So, it's really exciting.
Wow.
And I need you to be his body-man.
Pick him up at the airport at 7:00 p.m. And then, you know, just entertain him.
Because he doesn't need to be in hair and makeup until 2:00 a.m. Does Pawnee Cable Access even have hair and makeup?
Well, they have a communal lipstick and a box of combs.
As a nurse and as your friend, I highly suggest you don't try to stay up for the next 24 hours.
I can definitely do it.
I've already been up for 24 hours.
But I have a secret weapon.
NutriYum bars?
Leslie.
I know, I know.
They're terrible.
But they give me an insane 15-minute burst.
Plus, my nana used to tell me, "You'll sleep when you're dead".
My nana, she used to say the best stuff.
"Don't work yourself into a lather".
"Look where it is and you'll find it".
"Don't put me in a home.
" "Tell the truth and shame the devil".
"The devil knows where you're hiding".
"If you take enough rides with the devil, pretty soon, he's going to drive".
She was really into the devil.
I have not checked in with you lately.
I'm randomly and casually asking.
How are things going with Mark?
Things are good.
Do you think he's the one?
The one?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Good.
I'm here.
What do I have to do?
I have you on phone-answering duty from 4:00 to 6:00 a.m. That's horrible.
I have to nap up.
If I don't get a solid five, it kills my sunny disposition.
Got enough leg room back there?
Yeah.
Yeah, you don't have to sit so far up.
Yeah, I do.
So, Detlef Schrempf.
Three-time NBA All-Star, two-time Sixth Man Award winner.
It must have been pretty cool to be traded to the Pacers in exchange for veteran center Herb Williams.
So, you looked me up on Wikipedia, huh?
No.
Everybody knows that.
Just like everybody knows you appeared in two episodes of the German soap opera Gute Zeiten Schlechte Zeiten.
What, you a big fan of that show?
Huge fan.
Huh?
Oh, 6'10".
I'm 5'6" and three quarters.
All right, team, you guys psyched?
Just remember, all you need to do is take down everybody's name and address and ask them how much they want to donate.
Hey, do these phones dial out?
Yes.
Why?
No reason.
Leslie, you know what?
My phone has 25 lines.
I think it might be a switchboard.
Congratulations, then.
You got the most lines.
Figure it out, Jerry.
Come on, Jerry.
Everyone else has one line.
Oh!
So, Leslie, I hear you're going to be in front of the camera this year.
Yeah.
It's exciting.
Cut the chatter.
Tele-hosting?
Not as easy as it looks.
Okay?
This isn't C-SPAN.
This is Local Access 46.
Don't blow it.
Good evening and welcome to the tenth annual Pawnee Cares Diabetes Telethon.
I'm Pawnee Today's Joan Callamezzo.
And I am not a crook.
No, he's not.
What time is it?
I'm tired already.
It's 8:03.
Your shift doesn't start for another six hours.
Diabetes.
Yuck.
Tonight, we're hoping the people of Pawnee dig their big, chubby hands into their plus-size pockets and donate generously.
Weird, wacky stuff.
Stop it.
Coming up, a very special video presentation called Even My Tongue is Fat: The Story of Pawnee.
But right now, to begin with, let's start things off in our telethon with a song.
From Pawnee's most bookable personality, Denise Yermley!
Sweet dreams are made of this No one cares.
Hello, hello.
Here you go.
Right up there.
Hello?
Hey, there.
Good morning.
Who's next?
I feel great.
Everything is running smoothly.
Some of them want to use you Clipboard mouth.
Clipboard mouth.
There's some secret ingredient in these NutriYum bars that makes me feel so good.
Sugar.
It's a block of sugar.
Leslie?
Leslie.
Tigers.
Hey, you told me to wake you up at 1:45.
Yep.
It's 1:45 now.
I'm up.
I need to pull it together.
My slot is coming up.
Hey, before you go on, can I just talk to you about something?
Wait a minute.
Sorry.
It's Tom.
He may have a Schrempf problem.
Okay.
You understand that, right?
I do.
Take it.
T.B. continued, Ann.
I promise.
We'll talk later.
Yes.
Okay.
Hey!
Hi.
Are you on your way?
The Snakehole is booming!
People are loving Detlef Schrempf.
I had no idea professional athletes were so popular.
That's awesome.
But you promised to get him here.
Get him here.
Don't worry.
We're leaving soon, all right?
Bye!
Oh, you can't leave.
Tommy, this is the most business the club's done in months.
But I've got to get him to the telethon.
He's not going anywhere.
Okay.
Oh, God.
Problem.
Andy, I know I told you that you were going on at 3:00 a.m. after the Detlef Schrempf interview and career retrospective, but you're going on now.
You're kicking things off.
Whoa!
Sweet.
Headlining.
Yeah.
At 2:00 a.m. On Cable Access.
Yeah.
Let's go.
So, how are things going with you two?
They're going really well.
We're going to get married and I'm pregnant with his child.
Thank you, Joan.
There are two types of diabetes, but only one type of caring.
Type One caring.
And tonight, God willing, we will all be stricken with that.
There's a lot of fun stuff coming up.
Indiana Pacers legend, Detlef Schrempf, will be joining us in the studio later on.
But until then, I would like to introduce one of the hottest bands in Pawnee.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mouse Rat.
I know that life is crazy Well, okay.
Slight hiccup.
But we're back on track.
See that board?
When my shift is done, that board is going to read $20,000.
Pawnee Cares.
Hi.
Yes, I'd like to donate $50, please.
Mmm-hmm.
Leslie?
You've got sex hair You got it from me, girl.
Sex hair God, we're not getting any donations coming in.
I'm tired of waiting for people to call us.
Let's call them.
Everybody call somebody.
Leslie, it's the middle of the night.
Then, good.
They'll be home.
Donna, someone good?
No, I'm talking to my brother, George.
You're not supposed to receive personal phone calls.
Oh, I called him.
He's in Liberia visiting my uncle.
He wants to know what happened on Lost.
Oh, thank God.
Here you go.
Thank you.
I have no idea.
Did you put cream in this?
Uh, yeah.
Did I screw up?
No, I can drink it.
You sure?
Guys, has anyone seen Tom?
The ultimate celebrity, I think, to hang out with for a night would be Criss Angel.
You'd be talking to him, and then, he would just turn into fire.
Brooks Brothers Boys is like, the cuts are slimmer and it's cheaper.
Win-win.
Do you ever talk to someone and you're just like, "Oh.
We're going to be best friends"?
I'm getting that, right now.
He had two beers.
Light beers.
I need you to make that out, "To Wendy.
Tom is an amazing guy.
"You never should have left him.
"You made a huge mistake in your life, "and you're probably going to die alone.
Love, Detlef".
Do you know what, I think we should be heading to that telethon.
Yes, we will definitely go to the telethon soon.
After this song!
Hopped up out the bed Turn my swag on Took a look in the mirror, said, "What's up"?
Ron?
Ron.
Wake up.
Ron, wake up.
It's Leslie.
Oh, God!
Were you having a bad dream?
No.
I suffer from a disorder called sleep fighting.
That must be terrible.
Only when I'm losing.
Look, I'm freaking out, okay?
Tom is not here, and he's got Detlef Schrempf.
And I have three hours to fill.
I'm sure you'll figure something out.
Don't go back to sleep.
Okay?
I need you to wake up.
Ron?
Come on.
Help me.
Attaboy.
I am only here because I owe Leslie a thousand favors.
I'm not big on charities.
Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day.
Don't teach a man to fish, and you feed yourself.
He's a grown man.
Fishing is not that hard.
Okay, that was the national anthem of Canada.
And now, I'm going to see how long I can hold a D chord.
April, will you call some of the Rec Center teachers and see if they want to come down and show off their special skills?
Yes.
Nod your head yes.
I can do magic.
Egg, my lady?
Jerry, that's disgusting and fake!
Oh, my God.
It's real.
Go up there and do that.
You broke my egg.
You don't have a second egg?
No, but I'm a very good piano player.
I'd be happy to go up there and give it a shot.
Why are you wasting my time?
This is really serious!
You go keep your eye out for Tom.
I've got this covered.
When re-caning an old chair, one needs to make sure that one has all the right elements in place.
Over.
Under.
And you guessed it.
Over.
God, he's actually losing money.
Over.
Under.
This chair is almost caning itself.
No.
Sir, if you want to make a donation, you have to Yeah.
That sounds really cool.
You sound cool.
You sound really strong.
Hey, why don't you forget about the donation and just come down here and meet me in person.
What?
Oh, my God.
You're so funny.
You're funny.
Bye.
Hey.
Hey.
Funny girl you were talking to?
When it comes to preparing taxes Oh, my God.
This is a disaster.
The only thing that's taxing is deciding which software to buy.
I am completely screwed.
I have no Schrempf, no backup plan, no more NutriYum bars.
What do people want to watch?
Cute animals on a bike?
No time to train one.
Hot people kissing?
I don't know.
Maybe Mark and Ann would Have you ever seen this man sleep?
It's like underwater ballet.
I have a great idea.
What's that?
I think you should propose to Ann tonight.
Today.
Whatever it is.
On camera.
For diabetes.
Really?
Yes.
It would be so cool.
Don't you remember when Ahmad Rashad proposed to Mrs. Cosby on TV?
No.
I do.
Most women do.
On television, though?
Yes, but Oh, my God!
We talked about it being something big.
Right.
And I don't think we can get a hot air balloon at this time of night.
I have my grandma's ring.
I guess I could go home and get it.
Is there a story behind it?
Was she on the Titanic?
Was she on the Titanic?
No.
She was just my grandma.
It would make a great story.
I trust Leslie.
I don't know.
What do you think I should do?
And that concludes a quick look at QuickBooks Pro.
Quick Books.
Okay.
Thank you so much, Barney, for that.
Thank you.
Go.
We'd like to make a quick announcement.
Detlef Schrempf is temporarily delayed.
But coming soon, a really amazing thing is going to happen.
So, get your wallets out or get your handkerchiefs out.
Or get your tissues out, if you're like me and think handkerchiefs are gross.
For now, please, let's take a look at this moving video entitled, One Butt, Two Seats: The Widening of America.
No.
Ann.
Wait.
Ann, Ann!
Where are you going?
Just stay a little while longer.
Leslie, I'm so beat.
I'm so sorry that I've been crazy.
What did you want to talk to me about?
No worries.
It can wait.
No, no.
What is it?
I think I need to break up with Mark.
I've just been feeling for a while like something's missing.
And I kept thinking about the question you asked me today, about whether or not he's the one.
And he's not.
Mark really loves you.
I think he's ready to take this to the next step.
He doesn't know what he's ready for.
But I think I do.
I guess you're just going to have to marry him and figure it out.
No.
No.
No.
Why would you do that?
No, no.
No.
No.
Good for you, Ann.
Hey, Mark.
It's Leslie.
Change of plans.
Can you call me back?
Tom, get here now.
Call me.
Bye.
Hey, Leslie.
It's Leslie.
Hang in there.
I love you.
Bye.
Please be April.
April?
Yeah?
It's Joe from the phone.
I made you laugh.
You said come down.
Listen, my van's out back.
Let's roll.
No.
Please leave.
Where are you going?
Hey.
What's up?
Is this guy bothering you?
No, I'm bothering you.
For bothering her.
Are you her bodyguard?
I mean, she's an adult.
I think she can decide on her own what train she wants to ride.
It's time to go.
Whatever, man.
I work for the Sewage Department.
I'm up to my waist in hot snizz.
Take a walk.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
Heads.
Oh, boy.
What is going to happen next?
Okay.
My second favorite episode?
Monica is making dinner, and Joey is mad at Chandler because Chandler made out with his girlfriend.
So, Joey says, "Get in the box.
" I forgot to tell you.
There's a box.
And it's Thanksgiving Day.
So, they get ready to eat.
What is Ross and Rachel doing?
They're fighting.
So, Ross, Rachel, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are all together.
Although, is Phoebe there?
Yes.
So I will now drink eight glasses of milk in three minutes.
No.
No, you won't.
No, you won't.
Because if you do that, you will die.
Oh!
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Enough of that racket.
Well, Pawnee.
It's almost And, we need to keep those donations coming in.
I know we promised a special event coming up, and Leslie.
No.
Should I come up now?
No.
No.
No.
What we're going to do is we're going to pull our pants down.
That's what we're going to do.
Everyone's gonna pull their pants down for diabetes.
Okay?
On one, two Got my swag on Took a look in the mirror, said, "What's up"?
Detlef, are you sure you don't want me to drive?
I'm good to drive.
You want to come up and play video games?
Whoa!
Pull over, man.
That place has good chicken.
I'm hungry.
You just love flashing your ass, don't you?
When it's for a good cause, Joan.
What's up!
Hey, look who's here.
Wake up, Pawnee!
Tommy Timberlake is in the house!
And you know who else is with me?
Detlef Schrempf!
Tell them what they won, son!
All right.
Thanks, Tom.
Well, on behalf of the Detlef Schrempf Foundation, I would like to present this check for $5,000 for diabetes research.
Oh, man!
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
Wow.
Wow.
Big man, big check.
By the way, I'm drunk.
And if anybody out there I don't understand.
What happened?
I'm sorry.
I think I was a little tired when I told you that you should do that.
I don't think that that's something Ann wants.
Not on TV.
So, that's why you pulled your pants down.
Yeah.
Wait, what did I do?
It's 6:04 a.m. and I'm Perd Hapley of Channel 4 Eyewitness News.
And the story of this next dance is that it's called The Worm.
Good morning, Knope.
Morning, Ron.
Everything running smoothly?
You know, I'm happy to go back out there, demonstrate more of my skills.
How to start a fire without matches.
How to build a cribbage board.
No, I'm okay.
Thanks.
Get some sleep.
Aye-aye, Captain.
What the are you doing, Perd Hapley?
Hey.
Leslie?
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you sleeping?
I just I thought maybe you'd want to talk more about all the crazy stuff going on.
I do.
I really do.
Thanks.
Yeah.
I've just got to tell you, I'm a little tired.
Okay.
So, I may have parked on your front lawn.
You did.
I did.
Oh!
Yeah.
It's Just come in before anybody Leslie and I had an amazing talk.
It was so great of her to come over here.
Even though she was exhausted beyond belief.
Anyway, after we talked, she fell asleep on my couch.
And she's been asleep for twenty-two hours.
It's amazing what she slept through.
No way.
At one point, I thought she was up Hold on.
Hi.
Hey.
But then, she went right back to sleep.
I've been monitoring her vital signs.
She's totally fine.
I love her so much.
But I think I'm going to draw a mustache on her face.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your final warning.
Do not miss tonight's April Ludgate birthday bash.
Snakehole Lounge, the place the Pawnee Journal has called "the sexiest, most dangerous club in town".
That's not what they wrote.
Fine, I added the word "sexiest".
But we've hired better security.
Yes, I am a good friend for throwing the party.
I'm also a genius, because I'm using the occasion to stock the club with every available hottie I know.
Call me a romantic, but I believe by the end of the night, I will have between one and four new girlfriends.
Oh, that's great.
I'd love to hear all about your family vacation.
Hey.
Oh, thank God.
Get out, Kyle.
Hello, birthday girl.
Got you a birthday present.
Really?
Yeah.
I wrote you a song.
Score.
What's it called?
Not telling.
But I'll give you a clue.
It's named after a month out of the year.
So April?
No.
That would have been way better.
Whatever.
I can rewrite the lyrics.
Are you coming to my party?
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Are you kidding me?
Okay, cool.
Okay.
Well, we'll hang out then.
Okay.
It's going to be fun.
Yes, I am 21-years-old today.
Which is the age that pretty much everyone agrees makes you an adult.
The yearly budget and planning proposal for a city is called the Master Plan.
Isn't that just so awesome you can't stand it?
I shall now reveal to you my master plan.
Kind of sounded like a chimp there at the end.
Good morning, everybody.
I know you all have your budget presentations ready, but there's a change of plans.
Due to the crippling gridlock in City Council, we are postponing all planning and spending decisions indefinitely.
Until when?
Indefinitely.
And when will that end?
Later than now.
So this week, probably?
Look, we are bordering on a full-blown crisis, Leslie.
The state government is sending a team from Indianapolis to try to solve this budget problem.
Just calm down.
You don't even know what they're going to do.
Ron, they're state auditors.
They're here to slash and burn.
We got to fight these guys.
They've been sent by the Governor.
They outrank everyone.
There's no fight to be had here.
Yeah, you're right.
I'm not going to fight them.
Except that I am.
Okay, Leslie, what do we do when we get this angry?
We count backwards from 1,000 by sevens, and we think of warm brownies.
Go do that in your office.
Go do it in your office.
And we'll wait for these guys to show up.
I'll wait for you to show up.
Andy!
Hey.
You coming out tonight, part owner of the club?
Yes, let me ask you a quick question.
What's the youngest a girl can be that if we go out, I'm not a total scumbag?
You know the old rule.
Half your age plus seven.
Half my age plus seven.
Oh, okay.
Well, I'm 29, so half of 29.
Add seven.
That's only Twenty is Twenty-one Twenty-years-old.
Twenty-one.
and a half.
Twenty-one-years old and a half.
Yeah.
Yep.
We got the same thing with the equation on that one.
Here's the thing.
What if she's slightly younger?
Can I go out with someone younger than that?
Please, you totally can.
Yeah.
Tom says it's okay.
That probably means it isn't okay.
Thank you for meeting with me again.
I don't even know really what I want to say.
But I guess I just don't get it.
You know, our relationship was so great.
Mark, honestly, it was really nice.
But maybe you thought it was so amazing, because you've never dated someone for so long before.
Well, but for example, we barely ever fought.
That's not a good sign.
You're supposed to fight sometimes.
You're supposed to miss the other person even if they're only gone for 20 minutes.
And I just didn't feel that.
Did you?
Man, I should have yelled at you way more.
Well, Paul just called.
They're on their way.
Oh, God.
They're going to fire people, aren't they?
Yeah, I am two years from my pension.
Relax, Jerry.
We don't know that.
Maybe these people are very helpful and pleasant.
Hello?
Death!
Divorce filings?
Fourth floor.
Hello, hello.
Hey, how are you?
Hello, there.
Hi.
Chris Traeger.
This is Ben.
Hello, gents.
Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson.
Okay.
I'm Deputy Director Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope.
It is fantastic to be here.
Would you gentlemen like a tour?
There is quite literally nothing I would rather have in the world than a tour of the Parks and Recreation Department of the great City of Pawnee led by Ron Swanson and Leslie Knope.
Okay.
Ben?
I don't think that's a great idea.
Let's do it!
Great!
Chris is the most positive state budget auditing consultant I have ever met.
I mean, I made eye contact with him, and it was like staring into the sun.
People, we are here from the state budget office from Indianapolis.
Ooh.
What does that mean?
Look, simply we are here to tinker with your budget.
Think of the government as a broken-down carousel.
We're going to slap on a new coat of paint, we are going to fix that broken speaker system, and we are going to get those happy kids back up on the horses where they belong!
Okay?
Yeah.
Okay?
Okay.
Yeah, that's not bad.
There it is.
My partner, Ben, is going to stick around for a little bit, and I will see you all later.
¡Adiós!
Do you have a second?
I really like your shirt.
So I'd like to talk about where you think there's waste within your department.
Where do I start?
There is none.
What exactly will you be cutting?
And how much of it?
And can I watch you do it while eating pork cracklings?
Okay, let's start with personnel.
What can you tell me about Jerry Gergich?
He is one of the best people on the planet.
He's universally adored here.
If you fired him, there would be a revolt.
Okay, you need to understand that just to keep this town afloat, we probably have to cut the budget of every department by 40 or 50%.
Okay?
Well, but Chris said that you just had to, you know, tinker with things.
Yeah, he said that because that sounds a lot better than "We're going to gut it with a machete".
Okay?
You're a jerk.
I'm sorry?
Easy.
I'm sorry.
These are real people in a real town, working in a real building, with real feelings.
This building has feelings?
Maybe.
There's a lot of history in this one.
Maybe it does.
How can you be so blasé about this?
Because I didn't cause these problems, Ms. Knope.
Your government did.
I'll get what I need from the spreadsheets.
Thanks.
What's a not gay way to ask him to go camping with me?
Jean-Ralphio.
Looking hot, Big T. Throw them bows What?
Damn, girl, who are you trying to impress?
Just kidding.
I know.
Walk away.
Yep, you got it.
Got you a birthday shot.
Thanks, but now that it's legal, I've kind of lost interest.
Suit yourself.
I guess our awesome new park is on hold.
You have any idea what they're going to cut?
Nope.
I don't know.
It's just been a really crappy day.
Where were you earlier when I called?
Talking to Mark.
Again?
Yeah.
You want to get super drunk?
I really do.
Yeah.
Where's our lady?
Hey!
Hey.
I hope you all know I was instrumental in getting Trish crowned Miss Pawnee.
What was your talent again?
Oh, yeah.
Looking amazing.
Hey, ladies, is there anything you desire at all, besides me?
So funny.
You are so funny!
I'm serious, though.
Are you into me?
What?
Chug that, bitch!
Rules are rules.
Hey, April.
Oh, my gosh.
You look amazing.
Let me see you.
No.
Give me a twirl.
No.
This is beautiful.
Don't look at me.
No, look at me.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Can I get you a drink?
Or wait.
Yeah, I can swing it.
Can I get you a drink?
Whiskey.
Neat.
Wow.
You're not messing around.
No.
I'm not.
Barkeep.
Andy Dwyer!
It's so awesome to see you.
Hey, you, too.
How are you?
Let me ask you a question.
Was I a good girlfriend?
Ann, you were an awesome girlfriend.
Really?
Yeah.
Aw!
I mean, I was the screw-up.
Yeah, you were.
We had a good relationship, right?
God, I think so.
I mean, we fought a lot.
I know.
I know.
I know that.
Let me ask you something.
I'm hot.
Is that a question?
When we were together I can't see.
When we were together.
Yes.
Were there times that you were like, "If I don't see Ann in, like, Yes, all the time.
I loved Andy.
Loved him.
Loved Andy.
He was a totally helpless baby when we met.
I dated him for three years.
Now, he's an adult with a job.
And some other girl is going to reap the rewards of my hard work?
That's bull.
And I'm reading this, and I'm like, "How could they hurt those gorillas like that"?
They're such gentle, magnificent creatures, you know?
I'm an animal lover.
I don't know.
Hey, I want you to keep this bottle cap.
So you always remember me and the first time we met.
Classic game.
Plant the seed.
Harvest, like, a half hour later.
Here you go.
Sorry that took forever.
God.
Hey, baby, you miss me?
Because I missed you.
Oh, look at this.
Jean-Ralphio.
Hey.
Hey.
Andy.
Andy.
That's an all right name.
That's an all right name.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Are you guys Are you guys hanging out together?
Yeah, maybe.
Yep.
You know, he asked me out so many times.
I guess he wore me down.
I'm very persistent.
Come over here.
Come over here.
I can hear you.
I can hear you.
Come on.
One time, I waited outside a woman's house for five days just to show her how serious I was about wanting to drill her.
Turns out it was the wrong house.
She loved the story, anyway.
We got to third base.
Over the pants.
That's so cute.
Yeah, super cute.
Wow.
Right?
Do you want a Rémy Martin?
Probably good.
Okay, I'll get you one.
Two Rémy Martins!
Here we go!
You can have my Rémy Martin for your birthday.
I thought she liked me.
I guess I'm super bad at picking up signals.
That Ralph Macchio guy is a total douche.
Did I give you a bottle cap?
Excuse me, did I give you a bottle cap?
What?
Did I give any of you guys a bottle cap?
You sure?
Who the did I give a bottle cap to?
This party sucks.
Let's get out of here.
It's my birthday party.
It is?
Yes.
I'm sorry, boo.
You know what's thirsty?
What?
You know what's weird?
How thirsty I get when I'm weird.
When I'm drunk.
Ben, the jerk, is here.
Who are?
That one.
The one coming over here.
Get ready.
Okay, Leslie, be professional.
Hi.
Hello, Ben.
Look, I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot.
So I just wanted to stop by and Yeah.
Well, save your breath.
Okay?
Just get out of here.
Because this is a party with my friends, and you're trying to fire all my friends.
I Plus, I just talked to everybody in this bar, and nobody wants you here.
Okay.
Then I'll just see you tomorrow.
Sorry to bother you.
Get out of here.
Leslie?
That was so professional.
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you.
You have to help me.
Ow.
I know.
Me, too.
But you have to help me.
I think I may have made out with someone last night.
Oh, no.
Who?
I don't remember.
I don't even know if it happened.
I just had this feeling when I woke up this morning like I definitely kissed somebody.
No.
Hey, Ann.
Wow, that was a crazy night last night.
Yeah, crazy.
I mean, I left at 11:15, and you were still raging pretty hard.
I was.
I was.
Good.
Yeah.
So it's not Jerry.
Help me.
I'll keep an ear to the ground.
But right now, I have to go swallow my pride.
Leslie, Leslie.
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Wow.
You have a lot of bottles there.
Yeah.
Would you like a vitamin?
B-12?
Evening primrose oil?
Willow bark?
Magnesium?
No, thank you.
You sure?
Really good for hangovers.
Okay, I'll take one.
I take care of my body above all else.
Diet, exercise, supplements, and positive thinking.
Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born.
I believe I am that human being.
So what brings you here so early?
I'm here to speak to Ben, actually.
Great.
I'm gonna listen to some ocean sounds and do some chin-ups.
So I'd like to apologize for yesterday.
Don't worry about it.
No, what I did was out of line.
Twice.
And I was worked up, because obviously, you represent a threat to my department.
Your City Council and your Mayor are the threats to your department.
We didn't do anything to get you into this situation, okay?
Okay.
Look, Ben, I don't appreciate your callous attitude, okay?
Really?
Yeah, really.
Okay.
You may hold my fate in your hands like a small bird, but I still think you're an ass.
You want to get a beer?
It's like 10:30 in the morning.
Yeah.
And you seem like you could use a beer.
Let's get a beer.
Well Oh, oh, oh.
Don't keep him too long.
I need someone to be here when I take my multivitamin.
There's a choking hazard.
Okay, can we go?
Oh, my God.
You don't remember anything that happened last night, do you?
No.
Wow.
For once, it's Ann who blacked out drunk and not Andy.
Okay.
Oh, my gosh.
That's really dangerous.
Please tell me.
This is going to be so fun letting you dangle until I finally reveal that we did not make out.
Oh.
Damn it.
Good.
See you.
All right.
Hey, I need to settle my bill from last night.
Tom Haverford.
Okay.
Wow.
You had 47 drinks last night?
Ten cosmos, eight Smirnoff Ices, and everything else starts with the word pomegranate.
Was it your bachelorette party?
No, I invited a bunch of girls here last night, and they all put drinks on my tab.
And then I went home alone.
I'm not sure what happened.
You invited a bunch of girls here, and then you tried to hit on all of them.
Fair enough.
I mean, what were you expecting was gonna happen, a 43-way?
That would have been a little out of control.
But awesome.
Yeah, the problem is I only have 15 penises, so There would have been 28 girls that were really upset with me.
Yeah.
All right, well, thanks.
Hey, would you wanna get a drink tomorrow night?
Does it have to be here?
No.
Then, sure.
I'm Lucy.
Let me give you my phone number.
Wow, that tastes really good.
How's your head?
Mushy.
I'm sorry that I yelled at you.
All three times.
But I don't think you know anything about my department.
Have you ever been part of a government body before?
I have, yeah.
Small town called Partridge, Minnesota.
Why does that sound familiar?
You're Benji Wyatt?
I am.
When I was 18, I ran for mayor of my small town.
And won.
A little bit of anti-establishment voter rebellion, I guess.
Here's the thing, though, about 18 year-olds.
They're idiots.
So I pretty much ran the place into the ground after two months and got impeached.
The worst part was my parents grounded me.
Oh, my God.
You were so cute.
Well, thank you.
What was that song you played at the swearing-in ceremony?
Whoomp!
.
Yes.
That's what it was.
Yeah.
God, I was so jealous of you.
You shouldn't have been.
I mean, it ended up kind of ruining my life.
And now, I'm balancing budgets so I can show people I'm responsible.
So I can run for office again someday and not be laughed at, you know.
I mean, you want to run for office someday, right?
Yeah.
How did you know?
Well, you have to be able to make decisions like this, Leslie.
You have to be harsh, you know?
No one's going to elect you to do anything if you don't show that you're a responsible grown-up.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Please, Mr. Mayor, let me.
Whoomp there it is Okay.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Everything okay?
Hmm?
Mmm.
No.
You ready?
Yeah.
Hey, Ron, did we make out last night?
Good God, woman.
No.
Okay.
Well, that's it.
That's all the men that I know.
You guys just knocked it completely out of the park.
And I appreciate it, and we will see you later.
Hey, Ann Perkins.
Hey.
Hey, well April's party?
April's party?
Yeah.
Hey, man.
How's it going?
Hi.
Hey.
Yeah, Tom.
Hey.
Come here.
There's no reason not to love him, but I didn't.
Highway to the Danger Zone I've called you a cab.
You know, I just Okay, let's get you in the cab.
Come on.
Boo.
Fancy this.
Listen, I have meetings all day, but I'd love to chat with you.
Can I call you?
You have my phone number?
No, you couldn't remember your phone number, but you gave me your phone.
Terrific.
That's great.
We'll talk later.
Okay.
Danger zone Come on, guys.
We'll talk later.
This suggested plan reduces our overall budget by 35%.
And it contains very practical, deep cuts in many of our services.
Wow, Leslie.
This is amazing.
But it's moot.
Why?
Our investigation has revealed that things in Pawnee are much worse than we anticipated.
Meaning what?
Well, effective tomorrow morning, the entire government will be shut down until further notice.
I'm sorry.
I just started hearing really loud circus music in my head.
What did you say?
November, your bangs are cute November, your voice is a flute November, let's pretend the sky is for us Let's spread our wings and fly on a date I want to go on a date with you, November That song is about April.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Ron!
Hello, Andy.
It's quiet in here.
Where is everyone?
The government is shut down.
It's in every newspaper.
How long is it going to last?
Well, if we're lucky, this building will be empty for months.
Wow.
That is really bad timing.
I just got this super sweet-ass rad crotch rocket.
I've always wanted one of these.
But due to, you know, never having a job, I couldn't afford it until now.
Got a really good deal on my lease.
Paying 12% interest.
It's, like, one of the highest you can get.
Hey, so I've been trying like crazy to get a hold of April.
If you see her, will you tell her I really need to talk to her?
You got it.
All right.
Thanks, Ron.
Uh-oh!
Nailed it.
All I can tell you is that all the parks are closed until further notice.
Look, no one is more upset about this than I am.
Not like it's a competition or anything.
Because if it was, I would win.
But that's neither here nor there.
The point is I would win.
How long will they be closed?
Could be forever.
With the government shut down, who is going to stop Al-Qaeda?
One thing at a time.
School is out in two weeks.
What am I going to do with my kids all day?
Keep them in my house?
Where I live?
I don't know what to tell you.
What about the kids' concert tomorrow at Ramsett Park?
The Freddy Spaghetti concert.
Freddy Spaghetti has been canceled.
Well, sit down and tell me exactly what has happened.
Every year, we kick off the summer with a children's concert series.
And this year, the concert has been canceled due to the shutdown.
It's terrible, and we need to fix it.
All right.
Great.
I'm very glad that you agree with me, but I actually worked really hard on my argument.
Is there any way I can still kind of Yeah?
I'd love to hear it.
Oh, good.
Thank you.
You're wrong.
Are you crazy?
Can you put a price tag on a child's smile?
Leslie Knope.
What a surprise.
The government has been shut for two days, and one city employee has tried to schedule 14 meetings with me.
Can you guess who?
Ben?
There was a big concert.
Now, there's not.
Isn't there anything that we can do about that?
No, there isn't.
That's too bad.
Sorry, Leslie.
Damn!
I have to go run 10 miles.
I have run 10 miles a day every day for 18 years.
That's 65,000 miles.
A third of the way to the moon.
My goal is to run to the moon.
Ben, let's talk solutions.
Leslie, Pawnee is broke.
There's no money for a concert.
Okay?
I mean, Idaho cut their Parks Department by 80%, and Idaho is basically one giant park.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Ben.
Pawnee is better than Idaho.
No, Pawnee is not special.
Okay?
Your department, all the way down here, is not a priority.
And frankly, you're not even supposed to be in the building, Leslie.
You're non-essential.
That is not your call.
I know, it's on your badge.
This?
This isn't me.
Ann Perkins.
Chris something.
Hi.
I was just doing my daily lunchtime 10 miles and I ran by the hospital, and I thought I'd pop up and say hi.
Did you just start your run?
No, I'm already at mile nine.
But you're not sweating at all.
I know.
I have a resting heart rate of 28 beats per minute.
The scientist who studied me said that my heart could pump jet fuel up into an airplane.
I'd love to go out on a date with you.
I think you might find me attractive because you got drunk and kissed me when we first met.
And no pressure, but I do have tonight open.
I am so sorry.
I'm really busy right now.
No problem.
I will try again soon.
Ann Perkins.
That's the guy who likes you, that you're not into.
Yeah.
And which part of him are you not looking at?
Traditionally, when I end a long-term relationship, I'm a little fragile, and I have a tendency to do some reckless things.
So I need to stay away from Chris.
I can't stand this government shutdown.
I can't stand this budget crisis.
But what I can't stand is they're canceling Freddy Spaghetti.
You know everything.
What should I do about this?
I don't know, Leslie.
Why don't you see a movie or go shopping?
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
What's happening?
You know, they offered me a buyout, and I took it.
And so now, I work for Norton Construction.
Sorry.
I know I shouldn't have done that.
It's okay.
How could you quit?
You know, not everyone has your enthusiasm for this work.
You know, I guess I've been mispronouncing your name all these years.
Mark Brendana-quitz.
Recently, I had been thinking about maybe leaving this job.
But I felt like I needed a sign.
And then Ann broke up with me the week that I was going to propose, the government got shut down, and yesterday one of those pigeons took a on me.
And I was indoors.
So What are you doing here?
Hey, sorry.
I need your help.
Is this a bad time?
Lucy is here.
I'm in my sexy pajamas.
I just took four Benadryls to dull my sensitivity.
Yes, it is a bad time.
You're about to have sex.
Why else would Boyz II Men's On Bended Knee be playing right now?
Okay.
I just want to give you a little advice, which is don't make it last really long.
Ladies don't like that.
Okay.
Great.
Okay?
Wait.
Just one more thing.
Are you using protection?
You know what?
I'm just going to stay away from all guys right now.
Yeah.
Less man-time, more Ann-time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The only guy that I care about right now is six feet tall with wild, crazy hair and a ukulele that doubles as a water gun.
Freddy Spaghetti.
Children's concerts aren't a priority these days.
You know what is?
Sewage.
Pawnee's kids are less important than poop tubes.
I don't know.
I mean, what are you going to do?
That's the way it is.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
If all the parks are closed, why not just have the concert in the lot behind my house?
Ann, you devious bastard.
Well, the cow goes "moo" and the pig goes "oink" Well, I've spent the last three hours coming up with a plan.
And I sent up the Bat-Signal for all the people in the Parks Department to come and join us.
I told them to be here by 8:00.
Do you think anybody is going to show up?
A, yes.
B, even if they don't, we'll just put the concert on ourselves.
But C, yes.
Yes, they're definitely going to show up.
Although, D, maybe not.
I think that you need to prepare for the eventuality that no one Hello?
Hello?
God bless you, Jerry Gergich!
Wow.
I never thought I'd hear those words from you.
Hey.
April is here.
Move, Jerry.
April.
I didn't think you were going to help.
I still might not.
Jerry, how do you feel about lifting heavy things?
My doctor just said I should avoid Being a wuss?
Yes, I agree.
So, go out there and get the equipment out of the truck.
With current and projected deficits, we need to cut expenditures by 32%.
Let's make it an even 40.
That's not necessary.
Slash it.
Slash it.
I am an official member of a task force dedicated to slashing the city budget.
Just saying that gave me a semi.
Right off the bat, we sell City Hall.
Let somebody turn it into a large gas station or a T.J. Maxx.
Ron, that is a very creative idea.
But we don't want to sell any of our major assets, because we don't want to lose out on any future revenue streams.
I hear that.
Don't worry.
I have tons more ideas.
Okay, uh So sorry.
New ring tone.
Don't cut anything without me.
Leslie?
I don't care if you hate what we do.
I love it enough for both of us.
We're going to put on the Freddy Spaghetti concert today, 5:00 on Lot 48.
You can't do that.
Watch me.
We're going to do this, Ron.
With or without you.
Hammering away.
Crank it.
Hit it.
Needs 16 minutes for premium bounce.
Oh, hey, after this, can you go pick up Freddy Spaghetti in your Mercedes?
We need to give him the star treatment.
Hey.
Sorry we're late.
I had to wait on my girlfriend to finish eating breakfast.
Hi.
I'm Lucy.
Hi.
Hey.
We had dinner last night and breakfast this morning.
What were we doing in between?
Sex stuff.
You guys know Tom really well, so I don't have to apologize for his behavior, right?
Right.
The craziest thing is it's, like, super loud.
You know what I mean?
I was on it for only five minutes, and I can't really hear anything.
Am I talking loud right now?
Yeah.
April!
Hey!
Excuse me.
I called you a gajillion times.
Why didn't you call me back?
I'm so sorry.
I was too busy not wanting to talk to you.
Huh?
Jerry, what are you doing?
Leslie asked me to post these around the neighborhood.
I'll do it.
Really?
Wow.
Yes.
You want some help with that?
Okay, let's talk about Parks and Rec.
This one is a little complicated.
I know what will loosen up our brains.
Massage train.
And I know what you're thinking.
It's not that I want a massage.
I'll be the caboose.
And Ron Swanson is the locomotive.
And thanks to Ron, the services budget has already been cut significantly.
So, seems like the best option is job cuts.
Starting with Leslie Knope.
No, no, no, no, no.
If you fire Leslie, you might as well just get rid of the department.
Look, I know how valuable she is, believe me.
But we've run out of options.
There are plenty of other options.
For example, sell the zoo animals.
Okay.
To whom?
Cosmetics labs?
Weird restaurants?
I'm just spit-balling here.
Okay, let's switch it up.
Look, she makes the second-highest salary in the department.
It will go a long way.
I'm telling you.
It's just not an option.
Ron, focus up, buddy.
Just give me a sec.
Will you just stop and listen to me?
No.
Fine.
I don't want to talk to you, anyways.
Reverse psychiatry.
Fine.
What?
I like you.
In a, you know, romantical kind of way.
You do?
Yes.
Do you like me?
Yes.
So, then perhaps, shall we go out this evening?
No.
I don't think we should see each other.
Damn it.
Because you're 21 and I'm 29?
No.
I don't care about that.
It's because whenever I see you talk to Ann or talk about Ann, I feel like you still have feelings for her.
What?
No, I don't.
But I don't.
Really, I don't.
Well, I think you do.
So That's a problem for me.
Because of my libertarian beliefs, Leslie does 95% of the work.
So you should lay me off.
I'd be proud to be a casualty in this righteous war.
It's precisely because of your beliefs that we need to keep you.
You would maintain fiscal responsibility after we're gone.
I strenuously object.
Okay.
Well, Ron, we're moving on.
Every department is losing a Leslie Knope.
No, Ben, they are not.
No other department has one to begin with.
Right now, she's single-handedly putting up some lousy concert for this city's kids.
She's doing what?
Could someone else massage my shoulders?
Wow.
Looking good.
Yeah.
I mean, I wish we had built one of those elevators that comes up from under the stage, you know?
They're coming!
Like a rock arena kind of thing?
They're coming!
What?
They're coming.
What's up?
What?
Who?
The Russians?
No, the state auditors.
I accidentally told them what you were doing in an attempt to save some government jobs.
It's been a very strange day for me.
Okay.
Everybody, be cool.
Just be cool.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
All right.
Everybody!
Everybody!
Hey.
Ann Perkins.
Hi.
Hi.
Everyone.
You are all super amazing.
You are what makes Pawnee great, and I just want to tell you that I am totally supportive of your inspiring efforts here today!
All right.
Yeah.
Now, my partner Ben wants to say something.
Yeah, we're shutting this down.
What?
Damn!
That's terrible news!
Surely, there has to be a solution, Ben.
No.
Ben says no.
I'm sorry, everyone.
The concert is canceled, everybody.
No.
Here's the thing, though, Ben.
It's not canceled.
We're putting it on.
Okay?
Because the stage is already built.
Everything was donated for free by local vendors.
Everyone here believes that what we're doing is essential.
Freddy Spaghetti will sing.
Actually, Leslie, I just found out.
Freddy Spaghetti ain't coming.
Freddy Spaghetti may not sing.
But something much cooler is going to happen.
I think.
Ann?
Okay.
Good job.
You should hydrate.
When we canceled on him, he took another gig in Eagleton.
At a library.
That's literally the worst place I can imagine.
Okay.
Guys?
We're not giving up on this.
He's not the only musician in town.
Andy.
I don't know, Leslie.
I don't really feel like playing right now.
Andy, please.
Please, please, please, please, please.
I don't even have children's songs.
My last song I wrote was called Sex Hair.
Well, just take the word "sex" and change it to "pickle".
Pickle?
You got pickle hair, baby And you got it from me Yeah.
Still sounds like it's about sex.
I'm in.
I've got to grab my guitar from my house.
I'll be back shortly!
Yeah!
See, guys?
We have a solution.
And the good news is there's always a solution if your motives are pure, and your cause is just.
There's nothing Ow!
My arm!
You have two broken bones in your right arm, and four in your hand.
That's the side that hurts.
How soon until he's better?
We'll set the fractures, and I'd like to keep him overnight for observation.
Is there any chance you can fix me in the next 10 minutes?
Sure, I'll just advance medical science 30 years.
Great.
Can Mouse Rat play without you?
They tried once.
They're called Rat Mouse, and they're awful.
But you have got to find somebody.
There's an old saying in show business.
"The show must go wrong".
Everything always goes wrong, and you just have to deal with it.
Hello, Pawnee.
I'm Renata Ricotta.
Freddy Spaghetti couldn't make it today.
He bumped his noodle.
There was sauce everywhere.
It was just streaming out of his face.
It was really scary.
All right.
If you're happy and you know it Clap your hands If you're happy and you know it Clap your hands Hey, kids!
It's me, Freddy Spaghetti!
Hey, I thought you were playing in Eagleton.
All I know is this guy showed up and made me a much better offer.
I am all about the money, babe.
She cooked an itsy-bitsy teenie-weenie yellow polka dot linguine That she made for the first time that day Thank you very much.
Ron Corleone.
This really attractive woman is my girlfriend, Lucy.
Hello, Lucy.
Whoa!
Hi.
Impressive handshake.
Thanks.
My father told me that a limp handshake was for weak men and Communists.
He hated both.
Well done, Tommy.
Is that bacon on your turkey leg?
They call it a Swanson.
Wow.
I brought you your favorite.
Every color of Jell-O.
The Jell-O rainbow.
Thank you.
Injured Andy.
It's kind of like old times, huh?
Yeah.
I almost expect you to call me A-Cakes.
A- Cakes.
Well, I'm glad you're okay.
Oh, my God.
I'm I'm so sorry.
I should not I'm sorry.
That was not Spaghetti.
Spaghetti.
Fusilli.
Fusilli.
Egg noodles.
Egg noodles.
Why did you do this?
Well, I'm not a monster.
I want the kids to have their concert.
Mean Ben has a soft spot.
Is that what you guys call me?
No.
No, no, no.
Mean Ben?
Look, this is really great today, but there's going to be a lot of pain ahead, Leslie.
We have to cut Just Can you just stop it?
Okay?
Just for one moment, enjoy the fact that you provided a service for people, not a cut.
A service.
And they love it.
Macaroni.
Macaroni.
The biggest service was getting you to stop singing.
Linguine.
Tetrazzini.
Tetrazzini.
Hey.
April.
I just heard.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Listen, what I said this afternoon was stupid.
Okay?
I totally want to go out with you.
Good.
I want to be with you.
That was nice.
That Yeah.
Here's just one thing, real quick.
I want to be totally honest with you, because I like you so much.
Okay.
But, like, two minutes ago, me and Ann did kiss.
What?
But here's No, no, no, no.
It was crazy.
She kissed me.
Okay, bye.
Wait, where are you going?
Bye.
No, no, no, no, no!
Hey!
Bye.
April.
April!
Bye!
Dude, don't even think about kissing me.
And what was your favorite song, Chelsea?
Penne and the Jets.
Me, too!
Thank you all so much.
With all the parks closed, we've been going crazy.
It's our pleasure.
Come on.
You guys are the best, most important people in the most important government in the best city in the world.
Suck it, Paris, France.
Well, I would say see you tomorrow, but Great job.
Good work, Leslie.
Bye.
See you.
Bye.
See you soon, I hope.
I liked this a lot better when it was a pit.
Is that weird?
I'm sorry I called you Mark Brendana-quitz.
Don't ever apologize to me.
I'm serious.
If everyone in government were like you, then I would probably still work there.
I got you a going-away present.
You did?
Mmm-hmm.
Here.
Red tape.
So you'll never forget your roots.
That's really nice of you.
Yeah.
Well, I have something for you, too.
You do?
I sort of threw together some plans for a future park.
I couldn't fit everything in that you wanted.
Like the roller coaster or the shark tank.
But I think it's a pretty good start.
Thank you.
You're really welcome.
But, you know, Pawnee's bankrupt.
I doubt I'll get to build a park anytime soon.
I wouldn't bet against you.
See you around.
Mmm-hmm.
Morning.
Hi, what are you doing here?
Ron made me the official Parks and Rec representative for the budget discussions.
That's only supposed to be Essential personnel?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, shall we get started?
I have so many ideas.
Is this an autographed picture of Jamie Foxx?
There it is.
Thank God.
So how long is this shutdown going to last?
No idea.
I might have to get a temp job.
Maybe I should start working on my cologne line.
Uh-oh.
Check it out.
Whenever Ron has sex, the next morning, he comes in dressed like Tiger Woods.
You all set?
Oh, God.
What?
Who is that?
That is my ex-wife.
