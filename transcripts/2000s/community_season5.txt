{START OF EPISODE 1}
I am the system.
I consume humanity.
There is no escape.
Objection!
Jeff Winger, hero at law Best lawyer you ever saw Hero to freedom, defender of liberty South of the forty on Lincoln You park for free!
Jeff Are you a good person being sued, oppressed, or beaten?
I can help, and that's the Winger guarantee.
Call 555-her Maybe you should've spent less money on special effect.
Huh, thanks a lot, Francis Ford repo man.
Ohh, Jeff Winger!
Loser at law Rented office in a mini mall Relax, tango.
I come in peace.
Way I see it, I screwed you.
I got screwed back.
Now we can bygone the bygones, because I got a juicy new client and a bone to throw you.
You hear about that bridge that collapsed upstate?
A human could've said that without salivating.
I represent Marvin Humphries, the engineer who designed it.
He wants to seek damages.
From what?
His own pencil?
From the only school reckless enough to give him a degree in engineering.
City-funded school, deep government pockets.
Maybe you've heard of it.
Greendale Community College.
Weird choice, by the way, the bachelor's degree on the wall.
So you're gonna sue my old school and you're bothering to tell me?
You have access there.
I need Marvin's records to prove that he was irresponsibly educated.
Well, why don't you just subpoena?
Right, so they can have a shredding party.
See, that's the difference between you and Greendale, Alan.
They wouldn't shred evidence.
It's a good place for good people.
It's a diploma mill.
It turns idiots into bridge-collapsers and Jeff Winger into an attorney that thought he could help people?
Jeff, I once saw you convince an arson victim that he liked his house better burned.
God, look what that school did to you.
It took all your money.
It took four years of your life.
And worst of all, it took your Winger moves.
I still got my Winger moves.
Prove it.
Get me Humphries' records.
Because the next bone you get thrown might be through a dude's zipper in the warehouse district, and I can't guarantee you it'll be from me.
Look, I might be broke, desperate, and nearly homeless, but I still got one thing deep down inside that gives me power That was it.
That was all I had.
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said it can be here We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one, they all just fade away Welcome back, human beings.
Dean Pelton here, wishing you another magic year at Greendale, ranked America's number two community college by GreendaleCommunityCollege.
Com.
Regarding the recent tragedy surrounding a certain collapsed bridge, we will be observing a moment of silence on the quad followed by four years of silence to the press.
I told you you'd be back.
Shut up, Leonard.
I'm not here.
I'm just a figment of your creeping dementia.
Hi.
How would I go about getting records for certain alumni?
Why would you think a stranger could just walk in here and do that?
- You're, uh, Rita.
- Rhonda.
I've always regretted not telling you how much you remind me of my aunt.
It's more disarming than it sounds.
I have a very attractive aunt.
Rhonda, why are you wearing Jeff Winger's  Jeffrey.
Are you, uh, looking for your friends?
They don't go here anymore.
Maybe you're looking for something that was in front of you the whole time just a pitch.
He's asking for records for a certain alumni.
In the midst of all this Marvin Humphries business, I doubt this is a coincidence.
You're here to save me, aren't you?
- Yes.
- Oh.
I thought I might contact alumni to form a committee The Save Greendale Committee.
- Working title.
- Jeffrey, I'm gonna cry.
- Please don't.
- Request denied.
Mmm.
Rhonda will let you in the records room.
It's actually your old study room.
After you and your friends left, it was closed for sentimental reasons.
And asbestos reasons, but it's clean as a whistle now.
"Harassment Reports," "Hazardous Waste Citations," "Herpes Comma Water Fountains".
Come on.
Where's Humphries?
I see your value now.
- Abed, why?
- "I see your value now".
It's a callback to when we met first season.
And me calling years "seasons" is a callback to my first season dialogue, and me calling Abed, I know what makes you off-putting, but why are you here?
The Dean called me about the Save Greendale Committee.
- Can I join?
- Well, I - Oh, no.
Who else did he call?
- Just me.
I called everyone else.
Jeffrey!
Jeff!
- Is that cool?
- It's the coolest.
Jeff, if you wanted to save Greendale, why didn't you call us first?
Well, you guys just got sprung from this joint, and I figured you had careers to get started.
- Yeah, working hard.
- Ah, yes.
What have they done to our home?
The table's buried.
I got it.
This is where we became a family.
Jeff made us a family.
Hmm.
We could repilot it.
This could be like Scrubs season nine, a revamp, a do-over.
Jeff could come back to Greendale as a teacher.
I'm not gonna be a teacher, Abed.
That's lame.
Come on.
Sit in your chair.
Complete the table.
We want to help you save Greendale.
Yeah!
Greendale!
Greendale!
Greendale!
I got to go to the bathroom.
Mm, give him space.
Repiloting can be intense.
New people show up.
Regulars shift roles or even fall away.
Season nine of Scrubs, Zach Braff was only in the first six episodes.
That son of a bitch.
After everything scrubs did for him?
I'm sorry.
Vision boarding.
Okay, vision boarding!
Oh, hi, Jeffrey.
Dean, I have to warn you about something, because it's the right thing to do.
But first, why is there a big empty box on your desk that says "Humphries" on it?
Okay, the press has been calling about Humphries, and I didn't want any details about his enrollment here to be spun against us, so now there are no details.
Oh, ooh.
That was his thesis.
Okay!
So sue me!
This ain't Harvard, Jeffrey.
Okay, my job is to give a certain number of degrees per year, or we could get shut down.
And that would be bad because Ah, because then I wouldn't have a job.
And, you know, Greendale is a good place for good people.
That whole spiel, huh?
Yeah.
That whole spiel.
Wingblade.
Shock me by impressing me.
- He shredded Humphries.
- What?
I told you!
How could you let this happen?
Sir, I have to ask you to leave the concierge desk.
Jeff, this case was all I had.
I am screwed!
My wife left.
My girlfriend dumped me.
And they're sisters, so now the whole family's pissed.
Shut up.
Bring me all the paperwork for filing a class action.
Letters of intent, engagement, everything.
Multiple copies.
Winger, you just lost our client!
Yeah.
But I can create five new ones.
It's so dusty.
Let's get this off the table.
And that's the Winger guarantee.
Okay, maybe we should bring strong fundraising ideas - That aren't bake sales - Hey.
Or opening a zoo where the humans are in cages and the animals come to visit.
- G'oh!
-  Are you okay, Jeff?
You left kind of freaked out.
Well I can't stop thinking this school might be in trouble because of this bridge-collapsing guy.
He's the one making bad bridges.
That's like me blaming owls for how much I suck at analogies.
Sometimes a student will claim, in court, that their school ruined their life, and they'll win.
You want to save Greendale?
- Make it litigation-proof.
- How?
Think like the enemy.
How did Greendale damage you, Annie?
It didn't.
I love hospital administration.
- Is that your job?
- Wellnot yet.
But I administer things to hospitals, like these.
Pen?
"Futurza"?
They're a rising star in pharmaceuticals.
They invented fibromyalgia and the cure for fibromyalgia.
You push drugs now?
That's ironic.
I push pens, Britta.
Speaking of irony, how's the therapy market?
- Depressed?
- I'm on sabbatical.
You're jewish?
I'm doing hands-on research about the psychology of alcoholism.
You're a bartender, aren't you?
Which is basically like a modern-day therapist.
If somebody tells me about a murder, I can't tell anyone.
Wow, you're even bad at bartending.
What about you?
Abed's working on the next billion-dollar social media app.
And when it takes off, all I got to do is sue him.
It's fool-proof.
You're programming now, Abed?
Didn't get any work with your four-year film degree?
One job, directing a commercial.
- Still haven't been paid.
- I'll cut you a check tomorrow, but just so we're clear, you quit.
Creative differences.
I asked you to put the phone number on the screen.
I didn't like the number.
It's the number of my business.
It sounds fake.
How can every number start with 555?
Are there only 10,000 numbers?
Abed, you quit?
You said you got fired.
You haven't paid the rent of our apartment in two months.
Well, why don't you sell him a pill that will help him give up on his dreams?
Relaxabrex doesn't make you give up on your dreams.
That's a side effect.
At least the drugs I sell don't get slurped out of my belly button.
That's only on Tummy Tuesdays!
- Oh, it's okay - Oh, I'm sorry Andre left again.
It's It's not like last time.
He's staying with family.
He took the boys.
He took the dog.
He took the D.V.R.
It was my fault this time.
I cheated on him with Shirley's Sandwiches.
I threw the money into expanding.
I just didn't think I could fail.
Okay.
Well, just so you know, this is the sort of stuff that someone could use to make a claim against a school.
I have to go to the bathroom again.
While I'm gone, I want you to think about what I said as an exercise.
Do you guys feel weird about doing this without Magnitude?
That's everything you asked for.
Who are you flipping?
My friends, who are now the Save Greendale Committee, which I created.
Ohh.
Classic Winger.
I forgot what it was like to be good at being bad.
So just close the deal and bring it home to daddy, eh?
Oh, sorry, Alan.
Change of daddies.
I'll take it from here.
No, no, but it's my case.
Humphries was your case.
Jeff - You're scaring me.
- Good.
Guys like you should be more scared.
You trust-funded, body-sprayed, Eli-Roth-DVD owner You're an amateur monster, Alan, and you stomp in the grave of a real monster who was willing to stay buried because real monsters have shame, because they wish that You're not worth the monologue.
- Give me your tie.
- What?
No monologue for you.
Give me your tie.
That's for making me go to this school.
That's for making the last four years happen.
And now I get to make them un-happen for me and the only people I care about.
I failed my husband.
I failed my kids.
I've failed Bones.
I'm helping to hook a whole new batch of little Annies on Adderall.
I've been spending so much time with computers, your tears are just ones and zeroes to me.
Yeah, you were a real Hallmark card before.
I'm much sadder than the rest of you.
I will figure out why later.
Jeff, full disclosure Our lives are worse than the day we got here.
Well, that is a serious allegation to arrive at all by yourselves.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
And we've come to a decision as a group, and please don't judge us for suggesting it.
Hey, I'll back you up no matter what.
We decided to re-enroll at Greendale.
What?
Are you nuts?
Greendale!
Greendale!
Greendale!
Greendale!
You guys want to keep it down?
- Chang?
- Kevin?
Chang.
I've dropped the amnesia thing, copped to my crimes, and went to jail.
Now I'm on work release.
- Working as what?
- Math teacher.
Next, explain the pajamas.
Well, I'm on work release from house arrest, but I don't have a home.
See this?
This won't let me travel and this only has a 30-yard cord, so I can only travel Whatever.
You do the math.
- You said you teach math.
- Exactly.
I teach it.
You do it.
Chang was faking his Changnesia?
They seriously rehired a teacher they fired for trying to burn down the school?
After being rehired as a security guard after being fired for impersonating a teacher.
That's insane, and I'm Abed.
Worse than insane.
Irresponsible.
- Evil.
- I don't believe in evil.
But this school clearly got a finger up its butt as a child.
This place ruins lives.
If that were true, then what could we possibly do about it?
Make 'em dance, Winger.
Ew, Jeff, what's your evil old legal Nemesis doing here?
Nemesis?
No, we were partners again until I lost my usefulness.
I may be evil, but your friend here is so much more dangerous.
Tell 'em how it took you to make them think they wanted to sue their own school.
I did it.
Sorry.
Anyway, I'll leave you to pick up these pieces.
I'm gonna go score some blow.
My dealer's a gym teacher here.
You were lying to us?
I never lied to you.
I showed you the right truth.
Britta, when we met, you were an eclectic anarchist.
How did you become the group's airhead?
Thank you?
And, Shirley, you've gone from an independent divorcee striking out on her own to a bankrupt fry cook hoping for a call from her husband.
Troy, your entire identity has been consumed by your relationship with another man.
You found my Clive Owen Tumblr.
And what happened to Annie the Unstoppable Go-getter?
Well, there was that gas leak last year.
Oh, don't blame it all on the gas leak year.
This was a four-year process.
We went in one end as real people and out the other end as mixed-up cartoons.
- Cool.
- Sure.
This coming from the guy who's had how many psychotic breaks on campus?
Are we including the gas leak year?
You all came here with a chance to be something, and you all had that taken away from you.
Get something back.
Seek damages.
Sign here.
But you're our hero.
I mean, in the commercial The commercial was a lie.
You staged a robot fight?
Yeah.
In real life, the robot wins.
Troy?
If Jeff didn't change, then Jeff is right.
Case closed.
Let's make some money.
Okay, Jeff, if this is what you really want to do.
I'll sign.
The choice to make is yours.
No, it's yours.
We're putting Greendale in your hands.
Do we all have to say something?
- No, you can just sign it.
- Okay.
- You brought us together.
- With lies.
But what you do is above lying, remember?
You show us the right truth.
You won't regret this.
I'd like to take the study room table in back and burn it.
Burn it?
Why?
The same reason I never returned Time Bandits to Blockbuster.
Nobody else deserves it.
Jesus!
Looks as if you've lost your way.
Pierce?
Continue on this path, and you might miss your last chance to see the Pierce Hawthorne Museum of Gender Sensitivity and Sexual Potency on the central quad.
The museum and this hologram were donated in compliance with a court order I'm not allowed to discuss.
Let's just say some women can't take a compliment.
Unbelievable.
What I am allowed to discuss is Greendale, and I'll say this Don't turn your back on it.
Take it from a man with no legal right to be there.
You're in a special place.
A crappy place, sure, but only because it gives crappy people a chance to sort themselves out.
Did I sound gay at the end?
Do you want to do another take?
Ahh!
Jeffrey, I'm not decent.
I know.
These are the signatures of the five people that are crazy enough to care about this toilet.
And tonight, I almost got them to sue it.
- Heed the warning!
- It's not easy being Dean, Jeffrey!
Then stop being the Dean!
It's my whole ideantity!
I mean, wah, see what I did there?
That's proof!
Get your crap together.
Your job is not to hand out degrees.
Your job is to make this a toilet that people don't have to be crazy to care about.
But you could stay here and help me save the school.
For how much money?
I-I can't offer you any money.
I could offer you a job.
You just described slavery.
I mean, there's nothing in the budget for school saver, but I could hire you as  Screw you, Abed.
I'd be depressed right now if these samples from work weren't giving me a new outlook on life.
If you're interested in learning more, ask your doctor if Joyvatrex is right for you.
Oh, honey.
If we sue Greendale, can I be a surprise witness?
Wait.
Don't tell me.
Stop!
We shouldn't sue the school.
- Ohh.
- Come on!
Are you trying to give us emotional whiplash?
Look, if you feel there's more work to be done on yourselves, then as crappy as this place is, it's a place that you can do it.
You got a job teaching here, didn't you?
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, then, I'm getting back into forensic science.
That was my actual dream.
It's my fault I bailed on it.
A film degree doesn't make me a filmmaker.
I need to learn how to work with other people.
- I need to figure out who I am.
- I'll help you.
Get out of my brain.
I need to learn how to really run a business by my own standards, not Greendale's.
I'm gonna get a four-year psych degree, then a master's, and become a real psychologist.
Or you could find another major.
A real psychologist.
- How about English?
- Psychology.
All right, what's important is, no matter what, we'll be trying to talk Britta into doing something different together.
Burn, hopelessness.
- We got this.
- Oh, my God, be careful!
Little victories count for a lot around here Wow, this is good.
Even if you never asked to win in the first place.
And you have to enjoy those nice moments while you can.
See, he does a voice-over wrap-up at the end of every episode.
- Wow.
- Cool.
Because around here, they never last very long.
__ Once more.
More teachery.
I want to kill myself.
Use that.
Are you a good person?
Yes, unlike you.
I canguarantee.
The Wingerbeatenyou.
Not anymore.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Hi, everybody.
I'm Jeff.
Uhm Mr. Winger.
And this is Fundamentals of Law.
Any questions?
You, Red Hair.
I'm not gonna learn names.
- Will there be a syllabus?
- "Will there be a syllabus"?
Is good example of a question.
Moving on.
- Ski Cap.
- How are we gonna be graded?
Oh, no spoilers, Ski Cap.
- Maybe we better do names.
- Dave.
What percent of our grade will the final be?
Come on, guys, percentages, grades, that syllabus thing Are we human beings or just question-and-answer machines?
We're students.
And you're a teacher.
Yeah.
I'm a teacher.
Did you see that?
That teacher just leered at me.
- Ew.
- Hey, look, it's the star of "Head of the Ass".
Shut up, Leonard!
Nice earring.
You look like the road manager for the California Raisins.
Whoa!
What kind of teacher talks to a student like that?
- Right?
- Yeah.
- Fresh meat, huh?
- Yeah, Jeff Winger, law.
Buzz Hickey, criminology.
You can have that half of the office, but come spring, that corner is stacked to the rafters with fetal pigs.
I won't be here that long.
This is sort of a temporary gig for me.
Mm, I get it.
Teaching to make ends meet until a real job comes along, - yeah, me too.
- Oh, cool.
How long have you been   "Temporary gig".
Oh, I like you.
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said it can be here We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one, they all just fade away Oh, the new table turned out great, Abed.
Splendid varnishing.
- "Table Mark II"?
- I added that, and a few custom upgrades.
It's voice activated.
Table, resume table mode.
- Huh?
- Oh.
Table, power down.
Wait!
I got a cup on there.
- Oh, teacher man!
- Ee!
It's Professor Winger!
Please don't razz me about being a teacher.
Teaching is the most noble profession in the world.
Yeah, tell that to the guy that shares my office.
He fixes cuckoo clocks for fun.
That sounds like Mr. Hickey, my criminology professor.
I certainly hope you'll be a better teacher than him.
Annie, I don't know law.
I wasn't a real lawyer, remember?
I can't just pretend I'm teaching.
I'm not Mythbusters.
There's a two-day course called "Nicolas Cage: Good or Bad".
I'm signing up.
I've always wanted to know.
Nicolas Cage is one of pop culture's greatest mysteries.
Oh, there's a course on Nicolas Cage, but if you mention Jesus to your science teacher, you get a written warning.
Well, Jesus wasn't in 70 movies.
I'm in.
Cage class, sounds fun.
Jeff, you don't have time to take a blow-off class.
You need to figure out what you're gonna - teach your students.
- Thanks, Annie, for one glorious second, I forgot I was a teacher.
Oh!
Look at Mr. Smarty Pants!
I am so excited!
Jeff is gonna help me save the school.
Not all by himself.
I am learning Excel.
- Jeff, do you know Excel?
- No.
Well, it looks like you do.
Yay, teaching!
I, as you know, am dramatic professor Sean Garrity, and you are now embarking on an odyssey of discussion about an actor who keeps the world asking: Nicolas Cage, good or bad?
Yes, young man?
- So you don't know?
- Mr. Nadir.
Mr. Nadir drove our TV Studies professor out of his mind by proving that there was an answer to the question "Who's the Boss"?
- Angela.
- I admire your brain, Mr. Nadir.
I did not admire Professor Sheffield, but I promise you, this question has no answer.
Your homework is to watch five Nicolas Cage films by Wednesday, no marathons.
Space out your viewings.
Five, that's it?
Be careful, Abed Nadir.
Promise me you will be careful.
I have no idea how to make a curriculum.
Becoming a teacher was a huge mistake.
Without a doubt.
That said, there are certain perks.
- Excuse me.
- Wow.
I didn't know teachers could cut in line.
I can actually experience this food warm and disgusting.
Winger, what are you doing?
This line is for food, not for Lionel Richie tickets.
This is my house.
Come here.
This man's name is Mr. Winger, and Mr. Winger is a teacher.
You know what that means?
It means he gets your meatballs.
Ah, please.
That's all I have.
Get outta here.
Place is a zoo.
The trick is, you gotta show the other baboons you got a bigger, redder ass.
Let's hit the lounge.
Whoa.
Everybody, this is the new guy, Winger.
He's having trouble planning his curriculum.
What?
Here's all you need to know Break into groups, grade each other's papers, and please enjoy the seven-disc edition of Planet Earth.
Yoo-hoo!
Is there a Mr. Winger in here?
Jeffrey, we need to carve out some time to learn Excel.
Do you guys know Excel?
I'm learning.
You know the rules, Pelton.
Drop the checks and move on.
Oh.
Jeffrey, I'm gonna boot up my computer and download the tutor  - What was that about?
- Union rules.
Management's not allowed in the faculty lounge.
I could get used to this.
Nicolas Cage is so weird.
I mean, he seemed scared to smell that flower but happy to get shot.
He's a complex performer.
He'll give you The Rock, Con Air, then Face/Off, and you think you understand, but then Windtalkers, Guarding Tess, The Wicker Man.
He begs you to stop watching, but you can't.
That was an odd choice.
Would you say it was odd good or odd bad?
Maybe he's just good in good movies and then acts crazy in crap to make drug money.
But is he good, or is he bad?
Every actor is something.
Robert Downey Jr., good, Jim Belushi, bad.
Van Damme, the good kind of bad, Johnny Depp, the bad kind of good.
There's a spectrum, and Cage is on it.
I just have to find him.
- I'm gonna go check on Jeff.
- Oh.
Hello.
Hey, Jeff, how's the old curriculum going?
Great.
Consider our nation's youth pre-inspired.
- Want a refill, Winger?
- Mm.
- Is that Hickey?
- Yeah.
We're working on syllabuses.
Hey, let's turd some lockers!
Gotta go!
Teacher thing!
It's "syllabi".
Guterman.
Droppin' mad science?
Ooh, Elaine, take it easy on the Oxford commas.
Hey, walk, don't run, mister!
This isn't a racetrack!
Okay, dangerous minds, let's break into groups, discuss chapter one, and if you are lucky, we might sneak in a little Planet Earth.
Any questions?
Ahem.
Just a few.
Ahh, she in your class, yo!
So, I guess Uh Just Read chapter one And memorize the federal rules of civil procedure.
Class dismissed.
Not so fast, Jeff.
I assume you know why I'm keeping you after class.
Not really.
Ski Cap and White Dave got lots of stuff wrong too.
- You're the teacher, Jeff.
- You don't have to rub it in.
What I saw today was embarrassing.
-  - You were late, you clearly had no idea Hey!
You had no idea what Tort Reform meant, and when I asked you to explain the Sixth Amendment, - you pled the Fifth!
- I know my rights.
No, you don't.
That's the problem.
Here.
I gathered some materials.
Tomorrow morning, before class, I need to verify that you know enough to teach.
You're gonna quiz me?
You're the worst.
I wish Troy was in my class instead of you!
I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her.
Hey, wait, I warned you to separate these worlds.
She's lead, we're chalk.
She needs to be taken out.
Of your class.
I say minus her.
- Minus her?
- Give her A-minuses.
It'll drive her nuts, she'll drop.
She'll call me on it.
She'll report me.
Teachers don't have to explain minuses.
Why do you think we invented 'em?
- She's my friend.
- Eh.
You like the Leonard Meatballs?
They added something special.
It's Leonard.
Come on, I'm just messing with you.
You done with your bit?
I'd like my earring back.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
Go get your earring, you piece of human garbage.
Uh  Oh, my God.
Okay, hey, I have a working theory, and don't react until you've heard the whole thing.
If you watch closely, at the seven-minute mark in Snake Eyes, you'll notice the moment where an alien arm - could've come up and - Abed, this isn't worth it.
Maybe Nicolas Cage is just crazy.
All actors are crazy, Annie.
Some crazy actors are good, some are bad, but none of them are neither.
There's no such thing as both, so which one is  Nicolas Cage, huh?
Oh!
Oh!
Okay, so break into groups, and then, you guys quiz each other.
Mr. Winger, is that really the best use of our time?
Seems like the value of having you here is I think my value as a teacher is to teach you how to learn.
I think you're telling us we should teach ourselves.
I don't think you're gonna learn if I tell you how to think.
I think if you tell us what you think, then we'll learn that.
I thought you should break into groups, but you failed to learn that, so your theory's invalid.
Ooh, snap.
Break into groups.
Mr. Winger, how did you do that?
- Do what?
- You won an argument - against Annie Edison.
- You don't argue with Annie, Garrett, you let her argue with herself until she loses.
- You can win by not arguing?
- Yeah, Ski Cap.
Anyone that tries to argue has already lost, because they pick an argument to lose.
I mean, that's why I never lost a case.
Prosecutors beat themselves, because they d Here.
Because they draw a circle around something called "The Truth," and they say that everything outside it is a lie.
Annie, don't cry, you were right.
I actually might enjoy teaching.
I'm not crying because of you.
I got this from Professor Hickey.
What the hell?
He gave you a dead rat?
No, this is my witness intimidation project.
He gave me this.
A-minus.
I guess I overextended my schedule.
I'm sorry, Jeff.
I have to drop your class.
Okay, thoughts on Nicolas Cage.
I think he's a genius.
I mean, he keeps getting hired for some reason, and it's not because of his hair.
I don't know, if I was in 70 films over 30 years, and I spent each one talking at random volumes, I might accidentally win an Oscar.
I think our opinions about pop culture are fed to us by machines designed to criminalize - human autonomy.
-  Good one.
Dear God.
- Abed.
- No, stand back.
Give him space.
Nicolas Cage, good or bad.
A challenge, certainly, but not unsolvable, because all actors have distinct values, which I use to find answers.
Abed, how much Nicolas Cage did you Enough!
I watched enough to find  the answers.
Because this this is my reality, this is how I learned to be, and my being doesn't allow for Nicolas  Freaking Cage, okay?
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, I'm a cat.
I'm a sexy cat.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
O-o-ohh!
Abed?
Think of something safe like Holly Hunter, or Don Cheadle!
Abed?
Abed!
That was brilliant.
You gave Annie an A-minus?
How could you?
What were you thinking?
- Are you drawing a peanut?
- It's a duck, and it's none of your concern, actually.
Are you trying to cartoon?
Trying and succeeding.
State your business.
I want to know what kind of monster minuses the best student in his class.
I'm a monster?
I was in the storm drain lair of the Black River Ripper.
I have seen human heads used for things other than heads, so best not be calling me a monster.
Okay, you're a bad teacher.
- I got her off your back.
- I was handling it.
Unlike you, I know how to engage my students.
I mean, I may not love teaching, but I did fool around with it today, and I may hook up with it again a few more times even if I do dump it right before Christmas.
- We do not work for them.
- Maybe we do.
That does not count as an argument.
Yeah, well, drawing ducks doesn't count as cartooning!
It's one duck, his name is Jim, and publishers are interested!
Miss Edison, good news.
I talked to Professor Hickey and it turns out your project was an "A".
You used your connections to change my grade?
No, an A-minus means you actually earned an "A," but the teacher doesn't like you.
- It's a secret faculty thing.
- What?
- Are you kidding?
- Et tu, Brute?
Am I using that right?
I've been busting my butt for five years, and the whole thing comes down to a few old losers' petty insecurities?
- Oligarchy!
- Et tu, Brute!
- We've got to tell people!
- Mm.
Minuses are made up!
It's riot time!
Yeah!
Ugh!
Bring me their heads!
Pop pop!
Abed?
I couldn't find you at school, so I got worried.
You're throwing away all your little movies, why?
They have no value anymore.
Well, if you're looking for something to believe in, I know a skinny, little Hebrew handyman you could meet.
I'm not going to become Christian, Shirley, or a better Muslim.
This was my religion.
I thought the meaning of people was somewhere in here.
Then I looked inside Nicolas Cage and I found a secret.
People are random and pointless.
Well, in my religion, the whole point is that you can't understand every little thing, and you know, there's a word for people who remind you that you're not God, and invite you to try a little harder.
Prophets, messiahs, kung fu pandas.
- So Nicolas Cage is Jesus?
- Uh, no, but he clearly works in mysterious ways, and maybe that's just his job.
And that's why critics can call him a genius or an idiot and be right no matter what.
A demon to some and an angel to others, like a cenobite.
Excuse me, did you say cenobite?
Yeah, you know, cenobite, like from Hellraiser.
You like Hellraiser?
You know the word "Hellraiser"?
I thought pinhead in space was a bit of a letdown, but I'm in for the ride.
Rise up, Greendale!
Your teachers have been lying to you!
You deserve slightly higher grades!
Slightly higher grades!
Slightly higher grades!
The whole world is watching this!
- Yeah!
- Oh, wait.
I'm out of data minutes.
The whole world will be watching this on the first of next month!
Slightly higher grades!
Slightly higher grades!
- Jeffrey, do something!
- Slightly higher grades.
Distract them.
Take your shirt off!
- Here.
-  Slightly higher grades!
- Slightly higher grades!
- Everybody, calm down!
Just listen!
Do you think the students and teachers at Harvard are at each other's throats?
No, because they're all rich.
We all have something in common too.
We all suck.
We're all broke.
We all just went through an entire week of meatball lunches without even blinking.
Oh, that's on me.
I converted the lunch menu to a spreadsheet.
The teachers here are teachers here because they did something wrong, same as the students.
So get on the same team, because, take it from me, those of us that get to leave aren't going anywhere.
-  Boo!
- No, you suck!
Ugh!
Jeffrey, go with my "take off your shirt" plan!
May I point out that you're doing this together?
It's all based on rows and columns of cells.
I think that's why the call it "Excel".
- I don't care.
- Mm-kay, now, I know it's unrealistic to think that we can eliminate riots completely, but I have been crunching the numbers, and I believe we can reduce them by 40%.
Let's hope the man doesn't target you - for dreaming this big.
- Here's my plan.
You know that "Save Greendale" committee you pretended to form?
We need one of those for real.
I want a student/teacher alliance, with you in charge.
- I vote myself out.
- You don't have a quorum.
And don't forget, if I fire you, you're likely starve and die, so you know.
Do you want me to cut your meatball?
All right, look, there are two things I don't do well, apologies and drawing duck bills.
I lost perspective.
Students aren't the enemy, and, I don't know, maybe my bills are a little pointy.
Maybe I'm basing them on beaks.
Apologize to Annie.
I did, I gave her an "A".
I don't know how else to make it right.
Oh.
I guess, I don't know, I quit.
I got a better idea.
As our first order of business for the student/teacher Save Greendale Committee, we hereby ban the Dean from attending future meetings.
-  Yeah.
- Our second order of business - Lunch.
- Yeah.
I'm taste-testing rations for the shelter I'm digging.
Are you the coolest person in the world?
I doubt it.
I would like to address the fact that there are no Asian-Americans represented here.
We can get Chang.
No need to rush into anything, I just wanted to address it.
Anybody want some nuts?
__ __ __ __ __ - Quiet, I think he's just coming.
- This is gonna be hilarious.
Yeah, pharmacy please.
Yeah, this is Buzz Hickey.
I think you gave me the wrong medication.
I usually get Lipitor.
What do you mean my insurance won't cover it anymore?
My body doesn't respond well to the generic stuff.
Let me ask you a question, lady, can you pay out of pocket?
I'm an educator, ma'am, living on a teacher's salary!
No, I-I'm sorry.
What's your name?
Leia, well, let me tell you something, Leia, I wake up every night screaming.
Life is unfair, but it's the only thing we g Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'll call back later.
Mom, it's Buzz.
I'm gonna say this as fast as I can.
We can't afford to bury dad with the rest of the family.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Oh.
Please stay for complimentary saltines and full-price sodas.
But first, The Dulcet Tones of the Bennett boys.
when you were here before couldn't look you in the eye You're just like an angel your skin makes me cry Bro, free crackers.
Want to spend your life opening lockers?
You don't have to raise your voice!
I'm going as fast as I can!
you float like a feather oh, great, now I have these folders to deal with!
Et tu, pencil?
In a beautiful world when it rains, it pours.
I wish I was special Ass Crack Bandit!
Let's settle down!
Guys, what is known What's known is that around noon yesterday, an unidentified student dropped a coin in another student's, you know, upper buttock fold.
Yes, yes.
Gwen Ridley, Greendale Gazette.
Is this the return of the Ass Crack Bandit?
Okay, that person, Gwen, if he ever existed, stopped being active over a year ago.
Yeah.
Tim Briggs, Greendale Mirror.
Is it true that after the attack, you received a letter from the Ass Crack Bandit?
I never said that, Tim, and when did we split the gazette from the mirror?
And how many photographs do you people need?
Raul Lopez, Las Noticias Hispanicas De Greendale.
Will this affect soccer?
We did, in fact, receive a letter an hour after the incident including details not known to the public about the brand of Garrett's underwear.
Hanes his ways.
"I am the Ass Crack Bandit.
"Humans make better banks than piggies.
"Whenever I get more change at the store, "I can't wait to drop it down your butts.
"I think I will go to the bank and get so much change "and take all my dollars and make them into change and drop it all down there".
He should be called "the run-on sentence bandit".
From this moment, people, we are at DEFCON 4 if that's the highest DEFCON, and if high DEFCONs are worse than low ones.
Ah, you all remember psychology Professor Duncan.
Hey, buddy.
Where'd you go?
I was taking care of my sick mother.
She's still alive, but I've put in my time.
Britta.
Oh, Pierce, good for you.
I always thought that hairpiece was a bit cowardly.
Duncan is going to help us work up something called a "profile," so we can root this student out.
For the record, I tried to get something done about this two years ago.
This is not about you, Annie.
This is about the school.
This is the biggest P.R. crisis to hit Greendale since we held that rally protesting the wrong Korea.
Jeffrey, how can you help?
I'll take a look at the whole picture, see if any pieces match up.
Double fruit bonus.
Crikey!
Kiwi combo, mate.
I took a map of the campus and pinpointed all the locations of the Ass Crack Bandit strikes.
You can't handle the fruit.
During the bandit's most daring spree, he cracked three people in a row.
Today, I sprinted between all three sites.
My quickest time was 20 minutes.
The A.C.B. did it in 10.
So he's got long legs.
I think he has something I don't a shortcut.
The faculty lounge.
You think the bandit's a teacher?
The Dean's not gonna help me pursue this.
I need help.
Pineapple penalty, fool!
No!
Unfair and racist.
Look, no way, Annie.
Look, the faculty already hates me, and the Dean signs my paychecks.
But this is important!
I can assure you that's not true.
Fruit, fruit, fruit, fruit, fruit!
Collect the seeds, sucka!
After the tone, please leave a message.
Hey, Abed.
Lab ran late.
What'd Annie get us for dinner?
I hope it's not salad again.
I'd rather just stop at the meat store.
All right.
Talk to you later.
Oh.
Well, hello.
Oh!
Will you stop with the cups and the blankets?
This is how they comfort victims in movies.
Okay, I am hereby banning change from this campus.
You really think that's an effective well, guess what, your two cents is change, and it's banned.
Got something.
Frankie, somebody get me a bag.
Oh, give me that.
"I hope you enjoyed my work again.
"You can't stop me, because what are you gonna do, not have butts"?
Oof.
Dean, I think it's a teacher.
- I beg your what?
- I have evidence that shows Yeah, and I have evidence that shows I'm not listening.
Exhibit "A," exhibit "B".
Lalalalalala.
This is never gonna end if you keep choosing politics over justice.
Okay, you want to make trouble?
Go to Parker brothers.
You're out.
Take it easy.
Taking it easy is how Troy ended up with a quarter of a buck in his crack.
Annie, nobody's asking you to do this Jeff, come on!
You know how this school works.
We do it, or it doesn't get done.
The men on our coins understood that.
Maybe the Ass Crack Bandit's point is that we're letting our values slide.
Or maybe he's a frat boy coming from the laundromat.
The important question is "who cares"?
Look, let me know what you need from me on the down low.
Way down low.
And no squealing.
Okay, squeal.
Real Neil here, five days into the return of the Ass Crack Bandit.
It's alive!
Since we last spoke, three more victims have caught the quarter, with no end in sight.
Safety pants, 100 bucks a pop.
All sandwiches $5.
Sorry, no change.
Blame the bandit.
Here's a song that's been shooting up the request line faster than coins are dropping.
It said quarter to five, but it was quarter to ass you thought your plumbing was safe but your jeans were half-mast another coin down the drain now, that's some change that won't last The nature of the Ass Crack Bandit's crimes would suggest that he's angry or just fell in love.
We know that he hates money or loves it or doesn't care about money and hates butts or loves them.
Mm.
Abed, you're special.
Can't you just stand at the scene of the crime and see what happened?
I see a man Using a social disorder as a procedural device.
Wait, wait, wait, I see another man.
Mildly autistic super detectives everywhere.
Basic cable, broadcast networks.
Pain.
Painful writing.
It hurts.
Okay, ooh, LA LA.
Hickey, what have you got?
Heartburn.
It doesn't help me catch criminals.
Okay.
I didn't want to take drastic measures, but I've cooked up a little something.
Chang?
You better put a quarter in that crack, Mr. bandit.
Professor hickey.
Whoops.
Hah!
Gotcha!
Whoa!
Ha, what do you think?
I think this is spending too much money on a crime that nets you 25Â¢ a pop.
Ah, no, no.
This was free.
Then I think you just admitted you already owned a fake butt.
"I am the mad hatter, if hats were butts.
"I am neither left nor right.
I am the space between.
"To me, you're all like ants marching to class, freaks on parade".
I mean, why mix metaphors?
Ants don't have butts.
Wait a minute.
- Ants do have butts.
- No.
These are Dave lyrics.
- Dave?
- Dave Matthews.
Hard-core fans call him Dave.
Oh, excuse me for being alive in the '90s and having two ears connected to a heart.
Okay, so all we need to do is assemble a list of which Greendale teachers are Dave Matthews fans.
Guess we better get to work.
- Done.
- Oh.
Thought that would take longer.
So please approve the Dean's new security measure called "Troy's law," because a camera in the bathroom Is better than a quarter in your butt.
As we've seen, the Ass Crack Bandit can be defeated by using the three "B"s: Belts, briefs, and buddies.
Good.
The bandit always gets his victims when they're alone.
Bend over with friends over.
There's safety in numbers.
I got cracked!
He's under the bleachers!
Everyone remain calm, please!
All right, free-for-all!
Hey.
Where you been?
I questioned Guterman.
We can cross him off.
At the time of the first cracking, he was chaperoning Greendale's science dance.
The student that attended can vouch for him.
I checked out Mrs. Plimpton.
Airtight alibi.
She's dead.
Next on my list is this one.
Bublitz.
We're close, I can feel it.
Mmm!
This extra long churro tastes good in my real mouth.
Nom nom nom nom nom.
May I help you?
We'd like to ask you a few questions if that's okay.
He's bolting!
He's there!
If you're going to confiscate this, know one thing.
It's a mild, kind sativa, perfect for playing guitar.
There's been another what the hell?
Destroying classrooms?
Secretly investigating teachers behind my back?
Someone has to investigate the faculty, but you're like a single-celled organism no nerve.
Annie, you're suspended.
Wait, you can't do that!
Don't tell me what I can't do.
What do you think you are, Cosmo's July quiz?
She was trying to help you.
Let me ask you two something.
Let me be, like, the 50th person at this school to ask, what is this, huh?
- What is this creepy business?
- What?
I think you two like to partner up on cutesy capers so you can hold hands in the dark and address your urges in semi-acceptable scenarios.
Whoa, not cool!
You not cool!
You unprofessional!
I'm punishing you, Jeffrey.
Starting next week, you are the new coach of the water polo team.
- What?
- That's right.
Every morning, in the water Mm.
Craig Pelton, Dean and assistant water polo coach.
What?
This is the Ass Crack Bandit.
- Uh - I find it funny that you ever thought you could catch me.
Oh, that's very interesting.
Please continue.
I've enjoyed our game of cat and mouse.
It's funny how close your two little helpers came to catching me.
I liked watching them run in circles.
Although sometimes I wonder, are they chasing me as an excuse to get near each other?
I mean, get a room already.
We're friends!
Why don't you tell us where you are, and we'll discuss it?
I am the bringer of change.
I am the filler of cracks.
Oh, that's very interesting.
I myself was in 4h.
Oh!
Trace the call, Rhonda!
This means trace the call!
Look at the extension.
Tracing Tracing.
Got it, the stables!
We have stables?
Let's go.
- Creepy.
- I don't know.
Add some doilies and a foot bath, and this is my mom's house.
Mush!
Mush!
Mush!
Yah!
Mush!
No, run.
Mush!
Mush!
Starburns?
Since faking his death to escape meth charges, Alex "Starburns" Osbourne has been living in the stables, eating garbage, and trying to build a cat car.
He's also confessed to dropping coins down exposed butt cracks.
Case closed.
- High five?
- Sure.
- No.
- Oh, American high five.
Sorry.
Whoo!
- Oh!
- Ooh!
So much pain.
But now it's time to heal!
You're all invited to the official "we caught the Ass Crack Bandit" dance tonight in the cafeteria!
Jeff!
There's no way Starburns did it.
- Innocent people don't confess.
- Are you kidding me?
You knew it was a teacher.
You know that doesn't add up.
Maybe I was wrong.
Or maybe the Dean was right about us.
What?
No.
Annie, I took this case because I wanted to help you.
Then what is this?
It's platonic shoulder holding.
Look.
Leonard, hello, how are you?
It's a guy who puts quarters down butt cracks, Jeff.
Let's just let it go.
We can do better.
Aah!
Change is money!
What are you guys, millionaires?
T-shirts here!
Cracked but not broken, huh?
Who's in?
T-shirts!
T-shirts here!
- Professor Duncan?
- Yeah?
- Not going to the dance?
- I'll go later.
Oh, actually, would you mind coming and getting me when Britta's drunk?
Listen, as Britta's friend, I should give you this ad Yes!
That is my jam right there.
Dave Matthews fan?
Obviously you're not.
Real fans call him Dave.
Bum bum bum I've heard this song before.
Hey, winger, who is this?
What are you talking about?
You don't know who this is?
I remember it from the '90s.
Hee haw haw haw hee haw haw - It's Dave.
- Lee Roth?
You're not the Ass Crack Bandit.
Shh!
Keep it down, huh?
I made a deal with the Dean.
He said as long as I confessed, he'd let me slide on the meth stuff, and then he'd buy me a space heater for my stable.
Yeah, but why call the Dean and pretend that I didn't call no Dean.
I don't call nobody don't call me.
I got to go backstage once and meet the whole band, everyone Except Dave.
There's a whole album of photos online if you go to you actually wouldn't be able to access it.
I use an older, British form of Facebook called "mug-scroll".
- I guess I should be going.
- No, no, stay.
We're just getting to know each other.
I really shouldn't, I have a Oopsie.
Aren't you going to pick those up?
Yes.
Just Reach down with your hand and Bye.
This is the Ass Crack Bandit.
I find it funny that you ever thought you could catch me.
Jeff.
It's Duncan.
Annie?
Jeff?
Very nice.
Oh, bloody hell, my shoe is untied by British standards.
Here we go.
One bunny, two bunnies.
Oh!
Get Britta!
Annie!
Did Duncan get cracked?
Where's the bandit?
Do you see him?
- Over there!
- Come on, let's get him!
Shirley, what are you doing?
Looking for you.
Did you see someone come this way?
Jeff, Annie, Pierce is dead.
Tonight's celebration was cut short by some tragic news.
Pierce Hawthorne, entrepreneur, and expert heart attack faker has passed away, for real this time.
Pierce had been recently banned from campus, but not from our hearts.
He's survived by many ex-wives and all of us here at Greendale that called him friend.
If you're listening, Pierce, you were a hell of a d&d player.
It's time to level up.
Up next on the dial is Dr. farts.
I can't believe Pierce is gone.
Yeah.
Life is weird.
It's a container for all this little stuff, and you get caught up in it.
And then, the container just Pbbt.
That hallway led to a dead end.
We might've had him.
I should get home.
Haven't slept.
The case goes cold again.
Don't worry.
I got a feeling he'll be back.
Or her.
Ah ah ah ah 25Â¢ at a time he's taking our souls government men can't help, we're all alone are you feeling the breeze?
Did you pull your belt tight?
You know that it's wrong, you know that it's right out of the shadows down the coin goes Why, oh, why do you suppose?
Only the bandit knows whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh ass c-r-a-c-k bandit whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh ass c-r-a-c-k can't stand it _ _ _ _ You know, climate change is threatening our world, but there is a solution: The cat car, the world's first animal-powered vehicle.
My original prototype was hunger-based.
But sometimes, cats aren't hungry.
My new model will use a rear-fixed dog system.
But dogs cost money, your money.
By donating to this project, you'll be like an investor, except without taking all my profits.
Donate $5, and you get a thank-you email.
$50 gets you a t-shirt.
a thank-you email.
All aboard the cat car, and all aboard helping our nation's global warming.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Well, that was a weird afternoon.
I guess I knew Pierce was part of a weird, futuristic cult, but I wasn't prepared for a funeral with so much beeping.
Well, let's not judge.
Everyone has a right to whatever fake religion they delusionally choose.
Abed, you were by the coffin for a long time.
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.
Although Troy and Abed are in mourning Will you guys please stop doing that?
I can't believe you did it during your eulogy.
So uncomfortable.
I don't think the audience got that we were singing "mourning" with a "u".
You were singing "mourning" with a "u"?
Oh, no.
I still don't fully understand the laser lotus theology.
So Pierce's body is in the coffin, and we buried it, but this energon pod contains his life vapor?
Yeah, it's all right here in this incredibly persuasive literature they passed out.
Once you reach level 16, you can see the color blurble.
Of all the ridiculous cartoon nonsense.
If there is a blurble, the Lord keeps it hidden for a reason.
What up, N-Bombs?
How was the funeral?
Awesome?
No, Chang, our friend's funeral was not awesome.
It was deeply sad.
You know, funeral style.
Excuse me.
I thought you guys hated Pierce.
- We did not hate Pierce.
- Craziness.
All right, are you sure you guys aren't just doing the "respect the dead" jig-a-lig?
I think you have us mistaken for you, Chang.
I don't know.
I definitely remember you complaining about him a lot.
We complained about him when he was alive.
This is different.
Can't believe we'll never see him again.
Just a reminder you gotta live life to the fullest.
By the time Pierce was my age, he had already been fired from 15 jobs.
I've only seen two Police Academies.
The last two.
Well, he's gone too soon but won't be soon forgotten.
I would say you're quite correct, Mr. Winger.
- Who the hell are you?
- My name is Mr. Stone.
That's easy for you to say.
- And for us to say.
- I work for Mr. Hawthorne.
He specified in his will that no matter how natural in appearance the circumstances of his death, a private inquest should be conducted to determine whether any one of you, his former study group, murdered him.
What?
To be cleared, you must all submit to a polygraph test.
Aw, schnizzle.
You guys are in trouble!
- Later.
- Mr. Chang, I presume.
You're also listed as a suspect and requested to participate.
- Fine, but I ask the questions.
- I'm afraid I can't allow that.
All right, then just the "fine" part.
- We're losing Pierce!
- Everyone, quickly!
Someone get a balloon.
Season 5, Episode 4 "Cooperative Polygraphy" I always wanted to try a polygraph.
They're like the pie fight of cop movies.
Or the acupuncture of the legal system.
I can't believe Pierce would think we might murder him.
Yeah, what a waste of murder.
I mean, he was, like, 79.
I don't suppose anyone wants to know I consider this a violation.
Come on, it's just Pierce being Pierce.
It's his final wish.
If I had a final wish, I'd use it to stay alive.
Let's do it.
How do we begin?
We're to start with miss Perry.
- State your name.
- Britta Perry.
Have you ever had any thoughts of violence towards Pierce Hawthorne?
- No.
- Lie.
I mean, I may have wanted to slap him now and again, but I didn't kill him.
In all your sexual fantasies about Pierce Hawthorne, none of them involved his murder?
What?
No.
But you have had sexual fantasies about Mr. Hawthorne.
No!
What kind of question is that?
I'm asking the questions just as Mr. Hawthorne wrote them down, I assure you.
- Mr. Winger, state your name.
- Jeffrey Winger.
- Are you gay?
- No.
- Are you sure you're not gay?
- Yes.
- Gay murderer says what?
- What?
He's telling the truth.
I've been instructed to point out that that means you're gay.
- Ms. Bennett.
- Hmm?
- State your name.
- Shirley Bennett.
Are you a dishonest person?
- No.
- She thinks that's true.
Uh, you could have just said no.
I'm watching you acting scientific and then adding your little 2Â¢ every now and again.
Huh?
Continue.
Is it true that you're a platinum level donor with the pro-life organization prenatalpatriots.org?
- What?
- Keep it cool, girls.
It's my money.
It's my choice.
Yeah, well, if I wanted the Government in my uterus, I'd fill it with oil and hispanic voters.
Keep it frosty, ladies.
Don't let your goats get gotched.
- Mr. Barnes, state your name.
- Troy Barnes.
D'oh!
I meant to say, "butts Carlton".
He did mean to say, "Butts Carlton".
She said it.
Did you get angry when Mr. Hawthorne told you Fat Albert died of diabetes?
Yes, like any American would.
- Angry enough to murder him?
- No.
Is it true that you and Abed Nadir have an elaborate doomsday escape plan to be used in the event of zombie attacks?
We may have a designated rendezvous point and a couple of bugout bags filled with gold coins and condoms just in case we need to bargain our way onto a boat.
The gold coins are for buying food.
Does your doomsday plan account for the welfare of any of your other friends?
- Pass.
- Answer the question.
- No.
- Troy!
Rude!
It's a doomsday plan, not a picnic plan.
Do you really wanna see the horrors we might have to endure just to get on a boat?
- I guess not.
- That's a lie.
- Ah!
- He's doing it again.
- Pierce is doing it again.
- Mr. Chang, state your name.
Benjamin Franklin Chang, ready to deal out the truth.
Nothing to hide.
Let's do this.
Have you ever masturbated in the study room?
- Mr. Nadir, state your name.
- Abed Nadir.
Have you ever 9/11'd anyone?
- Nope.
- When you were a child, did you ever kill a squirrel with a slingshot and was surprised that you felt nothing and wondered if you were capable of doing it to a human?
No.
Do you and Troy still actively use Jeff's Netflix account without his permission?
- Wait, what?
- You told Pierce that?
You logged in at our place and never logged out, so we use it.
Is that why my review of The Grey is constantly changing?
- Yes, stop giving it four stars.
- I like Liam Neeson!
Then send him a message about the roles he chooses.
Look, this is not the issue!
You're stealing from me!
And as your roommate, you're making me an accomplice.
- I had no idea.
- Lie.
Why would I even try that?
- State your name please, Miss.
- Annie Edison.
Miss Edison, did you use your exceptional intelligence and organizational skills to plot the foolproof murder of Pierce Hawthorne?
Aww!
And no.
Is it true that you overcharged Troy and Abed for their share of the rent?
- Pierce!
- Annie?
Yes, but for a good reason.
You guys know you're bad with money.
I padded your share of the rent by $10 and I've been putting it into a savings account that yields 4%.
You'll be thanking me in six years when you find out you have $86.
- That's jacket money.
- Oh, did you hear that, Abed?
We've been washing paper plates and making our own toothpaste.
But don't you worry.
When we have robot bodies on the moon, we can share a free jacket.
Annie, you should know better than to horde money.
That's a stereotype.
- Was that anti-semitism?
- No!
That's sensitivity.
It's anti-semitic to do things like that when you know full well you're Jewish.
- Whoa.
- We could have bought a tire for our tire swing with that money.
Or your own Netflix account?
- Liam Neeson?
Not that great.
- Your rating system is flawed.
All right!
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait.
What do you mean, "begin"?
That completes the calibration round of questioning.
We're ready to begin the formal inquest.
I think we're ready to end.
We've humored this long enough.
Jeff It's for Pierce.
Look, respect for the dead is only a thing because the dead usually don't do any more damage.
- Ah.
- That's true.
You can quit any time you like.
But it should be noted that Mr. Hawthorne's estate is worth over $20 million and only those cleared of his murder can receive their bequeathments.
I'm only gonna say this once.
Clearly, Pierce is trying to lure us into a labyrinth of emotional manipulation and strategic instigation.
And I think we're all smart enough to know we should quit while we're not ahead.
- I do believe we should - Yes, definitely.
- Quit while we're ahead.
- Absolutely.
- Yep.
- They're all lying.
We all know that, you judgmental bitch!
Miss Perry, have you been eating the sandwich started by Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Hawthorne?
Yes.
And what sandwich would you order from Shirley's Sandwiches?
The only one I can, the Helen of Soy with no mayo.
- Helen of Soy.
- Are you aware that, in order to save money, Shirley stopped using real tofu and replaced it with a midwestern tofu substitute called "meatfu"?
- Oh, my God!
Oh!
- It's still not actually meat Legally.
You have never respected anything that I hold sacred!
- I'm sorry!
- Shirley, did you know that Britta was high on marijuana at your son's baptism?
I'm sorry?
- Well, no higher than usual.
- Not true.
You did drugs in my church?
No, I did drugs in the parking lot of your church.
How else do you expect somebody to sit through something like that?
At least with a bris there's an element of suspense.
Well, next time, I'll have Cheech and Chong do the warm-up!
Guys, these questions are obviously designed to turn us against each other.
If we want to beat Pierce at his game, we have to own up to our mistakes and forgive each other.
Mr. Winger, is it true that you keep trophies of your sexual conquests?
In a church, Britta?
For shame.
- It's where Jesus gets his mail.
- Answer the question, Adrian Grody!
I know what Pierce is referring to.
I have a box of forgotten items in my apartment.
I happen to be a single male.
Visitors leave things.
Is one of your trophies a pair of Miss Perry's panties?
You told me a hawk stole them!
You exploited me and made me believe in a slightly more magical world.
If you want to collect women's underwear, can't you just buy them?
- They have to be won in battle.
- Blegh!
Gross!
- Jeffrey!
- Awesome.
I think we can all agree that the gross thing here is that Pierce is snooping through my stuff.
Not really, Abed and I go through your stuff all the time.
Why do you keep bread in the freezer?
And why does your bathroom mirror say, "You're special," when you fog it up?
Look, I don't have to answer these - You took a shower?
- Yeah.
- Mr. Barnes.
- Okay!
I did it!
Okay?
I killed Pierce!
- Lie.
- Okay, good.
Just making sure.
You and Abed Nadir have a specialized, exclusive handshake that you refuse to do with your other friends?
- Absolutely.
- Pew-pew.
Mr. Barnes, did you invent that handshake?
- Yes.
- Lie.
Mr. Barnes, are you a subscriber to the video blog "Fun for Friends"?
- No.
- Lie.
Silence, wench!
Hi, I'm Kevin, this is Kyle, and here's a fun handshake you can do with your best friend.
All right!
Thanks for watching, guys.
Don't forget to rate us, comment, and subscribe.
- Can't look at you right now.
- Then you should know I'm crying.
I forgive you, but only to escape the established pattern of self-righteous indignation followed by immediate comeuppance.
- Mr. Nadir.
- Okay, I guess it's happening anyway.
You broke my heart.
Continue.
Is it true that you planted geo-trafficking devices on everyone in the group so that you would know where they are at all times?
Yes.
Okay, you guys are changing your faces.
Are you mad at me or hungry?
You're tracking us?
We're mad at you, Abed.
- Why?
- Because we already live in a totalitarian surveillance state.
Do you not read my status updates?
But I'm not the Government.
I'm your friend.
That's what governments say, nimrod.
It's cool.
When one of you gets kidnapped, you'll be glad you don't have to count the bumps on the highway from the trunk of the car.
- Are those blinking dots us?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, what's this one all the way to the side?
That's where Pierce is buried.
Is that why you were spending so much time by the coffin?
I was trying to get it back.
They're expensive.
And he's not moving anymore.
Abed, where did you plant these things?
If you makes you feel any better, you'll never find them.
I know you know it's wrong to do that without telling us.
- Shame on you!
- Okay, I'm ashamed.
Lie.
Miss Edison, is it true you once secretly dosed the members of your study group with a pharmaceutical amphetamine?
- Oh, uh, yes, kind of.
- What?
It sounds worse on paper than it was.
We were cramming for the anthro final.
Everyone was falling asleep.
I put 5 milligrams of something-something in your coffees and we all got an "A".
Done!
I'm a bad person for tracking your location, but you altered my brain chemistry?
I was up for three days that week.
I invented an entire language, you fliztbarping gitzgorg.
- I'm sorry.
- You messed with my brain.
That's a big deal.
This is a big deal.
I don't mess with your brain, Annie.
- You kind of do.
- I don't think I do.
What about her Facebook boyfriend?
- What?
- That's different.
You made a profile for a fake dude and lured her into an online relationship.
He's catfishing you.
You're Olympic pole-vaulting hopeful Brent Underjaw?
I noticed whenever you were in a relationship, you hummed a lot and made pancakes in the morning.
It wasn't about hurting you.
I did what I did in the name of breakfast.
I bore my soul to you!
I told you about my holding hands at Disneyland fantasy.
Do you care about people at all, Abed?
Answer on the polygraph!
Jeff made me apply for handicapped parking so he can get a better spot.
Britta's the one that invited Garrett to Annie's birthday party!
Troy won't sit on a toilet seat after Jeff!
When we're alone, Shirley refers to you guys as "those people".
Oh!
When Annie's with other females, dude, she calls Jeff her uncle!
Shirley thinks we're all going to hell!
- You are all going to hell!
- Oh, what?
Guys, stop!
We have to stop letting Pierce do this to us!
Mr. Hawthorne hasn't asked a question in quite some time, Mr. Winger.
He's right.
I actually forgot for a second that Pierce was dead.
Maybe that's what he wanted.
Or maybe he wanted us to know we're no better off without him.
Or no better than him.
He kind of nailed it, didn't he?
I didn't just masturbate in the study room.
I masturbated everywhere.
Everywhere!
Confession is good for the soul.
You should try it sometime.
There's another round of questions, if you'd like to continue.
You want to give us a moment to sit in our own filth before you heap another bucket on us?
It's strange after all these years how much we've kept hidden from each other.
You'd think by now we would have learned to be better people.
I think we got into this mess by thinking there was such a thing as better people.
Wait.
That's it.
If we're no better than Pierce, and Pierce is no worse than us, then that means Nobody's really that bad.
So what if we're willing to suffer and inflict pain at the mere prospect of material reward?
If we stop now, that doesn't make us better.
It just makes us so dishonest that we would rather be poor than admit we're flawed.
Pierce admitted he was flawed, and he died rich.
Let's celebrate his life and death in the honest way, not by saying fake nice things around a casket, but by admitting we're monsters and clawing joyfully for some of his cash.
So does anybody have anything left before we continue?
Let's empty our tanks of lies once and for all.
I'm Jeff Winger, and if I had my choice, I would rather look at myself naked than the women I sleep with.
I'm the one who hit Jeff's Lexus in the parking lot.
It wasn't a taco truck, and it was racist of me to improvise such an ethnically specific vehicle.
I only give money to homeless people when I'm walking with someone.
I've never been to Legoland.
I just wanted you guys to think I was cool.
I can be passive-aggressive sometimes.
Don't everybody disagree at once.
Oh, Lord, I did it again.
When any of you chew gum, I want to punch you.
You may as well have submachine guns in your mouths.
It vibrates my skull.
Everybody clear?
All right.
Mr. Stone, hit us with your grand finale.
May it be as brutal as we deserve.
Very well.
Mr. Hawthorne's final round of questions.
Britta Perry Do you know that you hate yourself more than you should and that your passion inspired me?
No.
That's true.
She didn't know.
To Miss Perry, I leave my iPod Nano filled with music to take life less seriously by.
Oh, that's nice.
I also leave you this liquid nitrogen cooled cylinder of my hyper-virile sperm in case your lesbian lifestyle one day wears out and you wish to raise an army of geniuses.
- Shirley - Hmm?
Did you know that you are not only a credit to your race and gender, but to our species, and that I was intimidated by your strength of character and business acumen?
Yes.
To Shirley Bennett, I leave my spacious timeshare in Florida Where she can take What's-his-name and however many children she has now.
I also leave you a cylinder of my sperm.
Annie Edison Did you know that you were always my favorite?
You mentioned it once, but I leave you this tiara, which you once refused to accept.
It's the same tiara I used to wear when my mother would verbally assault me for not being a little girl.
Also sperm.
Jeff Winger, did you know you're gay?
- No.
- Agree to disagree.
To you, I leave this bottle of fine scotch so that you're less tempted to drink this cylinder of even finer sperm.
Abed Nadir, did you know that you are insane and nothing that you said ever made any sense to me?
- Yep.
- Here's your sperm.
Troy Barnes, did you know that you possess the greatest gift life can give The heart of a hero And that it's up to you not to waste it like I did?
I think.
To Troy, I leave the obligatory sperm.
Maybe it's because everyone else got one, and because it's an old man's semen, but, um, I'm kind of disappointed.
In addition, I am prepared to leave Troy Barnes my remaining shares in the Hawthorne Wipes company, currently valued at $14.3 million.
On one condition.
You must first sail my boat, the Childish Tycoon, by yourself around the entire world.
- What?
- Again with the bait and switch.
When I was 23, my father asked me to do the same thing to earn my adulthood and his fortune.
Of course I cheated and floated off the coast of Belize for a year doing coke with John Denver.
I always regretted it.
I'd like to give you a chance to do what I never did - Become your own man.
Okay, I'm a lawyer, Troy.
It should be possible to contest these conditions as unreasonable - I'll do it.
- And Pierce can take his mind games and his sperm and he can put - I'll do it.
- What?
Troy?
Pierce was a crazy old coot, yeah, but I think he knew something about me that even I didn't know until now.
Because he's offering me something I've been searching for my whole life.
Millions of dollars.
And being a man or whatever he said.
Jeff, say something.
I'm speechless.
Somebody say something!
Abed?
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
That's a lie.
And then that sperm came down, I mean, I couldn't say anything!
But oh, my God!
I was gonna explode!
And then that one, that last question, with all of that nice stuff out on the table, and you guys were having this discussion about whether or not to quit?
At first, I was like, "Aaaaah"!
But you did it!
You did it!
It was amazing!
You're amazing, man!
You're amazing!
Guys, this is the best.
We should do this every week.
Oh, I'm a fun guy, you know?
I mean, you talk about lying.
I was lying the whole time.
This is who I really am.
This is me.
This is the real me.
I'm artistic.
Ideas come to me all the time.
I have this idea for a movie.
It's about this guy who oversees polygraph tests, and the biggest obstacle is how good-looking he is.
People can't focus and tell the truth.
It's unbelievable.
By the way, uh, we never found out how Pierce died.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe I didn't tell you yet.
It was dehydration from filling up all of those cylinders.
I mean, it's how I want to go, but, hey, I'm a little nutty.
Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?
Shots!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
This is from all of us, Troy.
When you're sailing around the world, you'll be going through a lot of countries, So we got you a universal translator.
- Cool.
- Bueno.
- Bueno?
- Cool.
Thanks, guys.
I didn't know going-away parties could be so much fun.
I should leave all the time.
Let's not forget it's okay to be sad too.
Britta, do you get kickbacks from big buzzkill?
- I'm serious.
- We know.
The truth is, a member of our family is leaving.
For a year, maybe more.
Psychology has taught me the human mind has a tendency to rechannel separation anxiety in the form of frivolity and giddiness, and I don't want us to waste our chance to acknowledge how much we're gonna miss you.
- Attention, Greendale.
- Oh, announcements!
Announcements!
- Oh, I love these.
- Whoo!
Announcements!
I'm standing here with Abed Nadir, who has chosen to give his best friend, Troy, The very special going-away present of declaring a school-wide game of hot lava!
- Cool!
- Ooh, that sounds like fun!
Wha no!
Process your feelings.
Hot lava is the sweet, classic children's game in which you are not allowed to touch the floor, or you're dead.
I think it's cute, and while I normally don't condone climbing on furniture, Troy and Abed's friendship has been such a special and magical part of Greendale, We owe it to ourselves to honor it.
Abed, anything to add?
Yes, take this seriously.
Stay on furniture.
No books, no bags.
The dead can't talk.
No coming back as a lava monster.
- Ooh!
- Yes!
Hot lava!
Come on, guys, this is classic avoidance.
I have to go talk to him.
Oh, and because the non-awesome often need incentive to do awesome stuff, The final survivor will win my near mint condition number one issue of Space Clone.
valued by the comics authority at $50,000.
Wh I'm I'm sorry?
The floor turns to lava in ten, nine, eight, seven Did you say 15 or 50 thousand?
- Six - Oh, who am I kidding?
Help, lava!
Five, four, three, two Professor Duncan?
You stay back, Britta!
I'm not afraid to push a girl into make-believe lava.
In fact, it's been my primary strategy.
I'm staying in the game, so I can talk to Abed.
I'm worried about him.
What I'm worried about is money.
My self-published novels aren't going to publish themselves.
Don't regress to primal behavior just because it's allowed.
We're human beings, not the editors of Teen Vogue.
They're setting a terrible example for today's young women.
Well, I'm sorry, Britta, But it's either you or me And I'm me.
- No!
- Yes, yes, yes!
Oh!
Real nice, Winger.
This is why the English never win any sports.
'cause everyone else cheats!
Britta, there you are.
Sweet, sweet, portable chairs.
Plastic gold.
Four-legged diamonds.
You claiming this?
Lava joust?
Did you all hit your heads on each other's heads?
Let's get real, Britta.
Once the last of the chairs are gone, a sofa hopper like you won't last 20 minutes.
You want to join this alliance, - or you want to join the lava?
- Fine.
But I'm not learning the new names for anything.
Centipeding isn't the fastest form of travel, But if we find more chairs, We can do the inchworm, scootenanny, The reverse Danny Thomas.
Do you think this game's gotten a little out of hand?
Eh, feels normal enough for a school that's on 911's blocked caller list.
And I like that Abed wanted to send Troy off in a cool way.
Send him off or put off sending him?
I think this imaginary lava might symbolize Abed's fear of change.
I think that diagnosis symbolizes your lack of a psych degree.
Mama mahogany, feast your feet on that stack of sticks.
Eh, too easy.
Could be a trap.
As if someone else is taking this game as seriously as you.
Let's keep this centipede rolling.
Give me a chair.
Ugh, so stupid.
Come on.
- Shh, shh!
- Locker, locker, locker.
- Locker, locker.
- Locker boys!
Oh!
Locker!
Winger, Edison, and Perry.
What a delicious combination.
Lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock!
What are we getting from this extra level of commitment?
We're getting your chairs, your food, and the names of your same-sex celebrity crushes.
Everyone has one, don't lie.
Then you're free to go into lava!
Lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock, lock!
Ooh-whoo-ooh!
Stand down or meet your doom, Chang.
You're in no position to make threats, floor strider.
Our truce ended when you banished us from the pay phone bench.
You used that bench to upset the balance.
By the Vapors of Magmarath, we will restore it.
You have gods?
Locker boys!
Earn your M&Ms!
Locker!
Troy and Abed intimidation stance.
I guess that actually looked the way it did in my head.
Hiya, kids.
I'm criminology professor Buzz Hickey, And this this is just a little something I threw together.
Aah!
Jump!
Aah!
s Centipede, centipede!
Okay!
Pull harder!
Pull harder!
Pull harder!
My same-sex celebrity crush is Nathan Fillion!
Nathan Fillion!
Jeff, Annie!
Get to Shirley Island.
We'll meet you there.
Abed, save yourself!
Abed, before Troy "dies in lava," you can save yourself emotionally by honestly experiencing the pain of him leaving Greendale!
We can do this in three steps.
Britta, jump to that trash can.
Troy, start inchworming.
What's the third step?
The third step's survival.
Good luck, Britta.
Seriously?
Troy!
Sorry, Britta, Abed knows best.
But I'll always remember you as kind of slowing us down and complaining a lot.
Oh, my no!
They abandoned you?
This game's doing bad things to people.
Now me, I'm just in it for the money.
My son's getting gay married.
The flowers alone, you have no idea.
I get it.
I lived in New York.
All right, Miss Perry, climb aboard.
It's fake killing time.
Welcome to Shirley Island.
No furniture beyond this point.
Leave your weapons at the door and any spare doors at the entrance.
Then came the now-now times When the floors were covered with the burny touch.
Ooh.
You made it.
Friends!
Welcome to Shirley Island, where all your dreams come true, If you dream of standing on a table and pissing in a jar.
Where's Britta?
She didn't make it.
Oh, that's too bad.
Poor Britta.
It's okay.
Her sacrifice got us this far, and now we can't lose.
Why not?
Because now we're on Shirley Island, and according to legend So is the orb.
I'm sure I have no idea what you're speaking of.
- This is a place of peace.
- And profit.
Come again?
You're not really playing, Shirley.
You're a merchant, and more power to you.
But don't withhold power from others just to make money.
We want the orb.
Abed.
Listen, I'm still a little raw from what happened with Britta back there.
I mean, fun is fun, but I don't want my last day here to be a day where everyone hates me.
Last day?
Citizens of Shirley Island!
What have you brought to my door?
Stay back!
- My God, it's Hickey.
- Aah!
And he's got chair walkers!
Come out with your feet on the floor, and there will be no need for nudging or jostling.
I did not skip my son's birthday for second place!
I want to say something to you guys about mental health.
Is that Britta?
Is she alive?
Why did you think she was dead?
We kind of left her.
Left her for dead?
Sounds bad when you put it that way.
Can you put it a way that sounds good?
You do realize this isn't just a pile of chairs, right?
This is a crib, And you're curled up inside there, sucking your thumb, because you're too scared to say good-bye.
Well, it's time to grow up.
The adults are here, and we're gonna tear down your fort.
Chair walkers, attack!
Ah-ooh!
Ah-ooh!
My name was Vicki!
Tell my story!
These are my only pants!
I can't get them dirty!
I'm actually British!
Leonard!
Butter 'em up!
You got it!
Cirque du so long, you high-stepping acro-bastards!
Do you have any rolling chairs?
Behind the curtain.
Abandon fort!
Women and man-children first!
Hey, seat feet!
Chair to dance?
Yes!
Aah!
Britta, I'm your friend.
I can't hear dead people, Annie.
- I'm in a world of imagination.
- Ha!
Then imagine what the floor looks like.
I don't have to.
I'll just imagine where you're about to be!
That's the same as imagining the floor.
Then you just admitted that's where you'll be.
Knock, knock, Britta.
I'm not gonna say "who's there"?
because someone on the floor is knocking.
Well, that's lame.
You have to say, "who's there"?
Floor!
What?
That's who's there!
Yeah!
But it's for you!
Ah!
Aah!
Shirley, give us the orb, and we can save Shirley Island.
The orb can't save Shirley island because Shirley Island is the orb.
In a cool way like Keyser Soze or a lame way like Jewel of the Nile?
You tell Buzz Hickey that Shirley Bennett said Well, I don't want to waste your time.
Just think of something cool and give me credit.
But the door I'm knocking on is your home, so if I'm the floor, it means you're dead.
If you're the floor, you're already dead.
Just do it right!
Knock, knock!
Knock, knock!
Oh!
Who's there, bitch?
Floor!
Floor!
Aah!
Oh!
Troy and Abed in a bubble Ha!
Hickey, you chicken.
He gutted us.
Retreat!
Hello?
Hello?
I'm the only one left.
I won 50,000 bucks.
That's 50,000 lottery tickets!
You can't outrun your emotions!
Aah!
Aah!
I had a dream like this, but it was sexual.
I will force you two to grieve properly even if it kills us all!
Go away, Britta!
Oh!
Aah!
- Yay!
- Ow!
- Yay!
- Ow!
Ow!
Sorry about our butts touching.
Okay, we'll go into the vents.
They'll never find us there.
I say we take a stand here.
I mean, someone's got to win sometime.
Not if we never kill each other.
Then we can play forever.
Right.
Wait.
Abed, the floor can't be lava forever.
The game's got to end.
It's not a game for me, Troy.
I'm seeing real lava because you're leaving.
It's embarrassing, and I don't want to be crazy, but I am crazy, so I made a game that made you and everyone else see what I see.
I don't want it to be there either, I swear.
I want you to be able to leave, but I don't think the lava goes away until you stop leaving.
So the only way I can help you is by giving up my chance to be one person?
- You guys ready for closure?
- Of your caskets?
Guys, stop, okay?
The lava's real to Abed.
- It's not a game to him.
- Oh, no.
You know what I think?
I think he's used to getting his own way.
I think he's never met me.
- Aah!
- No!
Abed!
Abed.
Uh!
Unbelievable.
When this game is over, I'm gonna shove you back.
Abed, give me your other hand!
It's down to us.
You or Britta will be the winner.
I'm not leaving, okay?
Just I promise.
Just the floor's not lava now.
Just give me your hand.
I don't think the lava's here because you're leaving.
I think it's here because I won't let go.
Sorry.
- Bye.
- Abed.
Abed.
Abed!
Abed!
Abed!
Abed!
Abed.
He's he's fake dead.
Forever.
El esta muerto para siempre.
- Shut up.
- Callate.
- What?
- Que?
- Stop!
- Para.
He's not really dead.
No, but he's really playing dead, and he's not gonna stop.
Here.
Congratulations, you win.
You don't get it.
No one gets Abed.
I got him a little.
This is my fault.
I don't deserve to fake live.
Wait!
No.
- I can fix it.
- How?
I-I don't know.
In real life, I don't know, but I can fake fix him.
Uh, I can clone him.
- I'll clone him.
- Go on.
I just need his DNA.
Let's get his DNA.
Don't touch the lava.
You might be onto something.
I'm gonna find discarded technology From this once great civilization And start a cloning machine.
Mm!
Okay, I'm placing this cellular regeneration sequencer on the spot where he died.
Here, don't forget this.
This is a laser guidance system that keeps the regeneration sequence from, um jib-jabbing.
Jib-jabbing?
Initiate regeneration sequence.
It worked.
We made a perfect clone of Abed.
Actually, Britta's work was sloppy.
I'm not an exact replication.
I have all of Abed's abilities and memories, but I'm missing his wild emotionality.
Although I think I may be able to let Troy go now.
I don't know.
I haven't been completely honest.
I'm really scared to go on my trip.
Well, you don't have to go.
Your clone can.
Right.
So you guys are all cloned up too, huh?
Yeah, believe in cloning.
Well, guess that's my ride.
I'm so excited for you.
You're gonna see the world and experience new cultures.
I mean, technically all culture has been homogenized by 50 years of American imperialism, But at least the candy bar wrappers will God, there I go.
Almost Britta'd our good-bye, huh?
I'm the worst.
You're the best, and I love you.
I'm better at sex than Jeff, right?
I've yet to have anyone worse.
All I ever wanted in high school was for Troy Barnes yo notice me, and then I ended up living with you.
- I'm pretty lucky.
- I'm not.
I had a chance to be your friend in high school, but I was too busy trying to be cool.
I missed out on four more years of Annie.
Aw!
You are the coolest guy I know.
I hope I make you proud.
I've never stepped foot outside of Colorado.
You're becoming much cooler than me by doing this.
Thanks for looking out for me.
Thank you for putting up with the boring, old mom in your college study group.
You made a furniture fortress.
You're the badass from our study group.
Clone Troy.
Clone Abed.
By the way, when I cloned you, I had to patch some missing parts of your DNA with genes from a homing pigeon.
You may notice side effects, like a compulsion to come back.
Cool.
Clone hug?
So you're really just gonna pilot this thing all on your own?
Well, Pierce's will stated that someone would be assigned to travel with me - to verify that I don't cheat.
- Captain Barnes.
We should probably set sail while the wind is still in our favor, don't you think?
Engage.
A gathering of angels Appeared above my head Now, Troy, I know it's gonna be difficult for you to interact with me No, no.
That was the original Troy.
I'm his clone.
Let's get the lead out, Burton.
Aye, aye, sir.
They said, come sail away, come sail away Come sail away with me, that's Come sail away, come sail away Come sail away with me You know, starting a sea voyage from landlocked Colorado - May not have been the best idea.
- We'll drive to the river and then take the river to the ocean.
Actually, I never thought I'd see you again.
I have a couple Star Trek questions, if you don't mind.
No, go ahead.
What time did you guys have to get up in the morning?
Does every writer write for one character?
What's a best boy?
I saw it in the credits once.
Why don't they call it Planet Trek?
You never go to a star.
You Not one episode.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Save Greendale Committee, please welcome our newest member, math teacher Ben Chang.
Okay, let's get serious.
I've compiled a short list of the most immediate Greendale emergencies.
Is deforestation on the list?
I, for one, am glad that this is happening.
What this school needs is a band of heroes, champions willing to rise up and "get all those potatoes out of the gym".
We're like House Vagadosh in the HBO original series Bloodlines of Conquest.
Bloodlines of Conquest.
That's my show right there.
- That is a good show.
- They really get the incest right.
What the hell is Bloodlines of Conquest?
It's a medieval fantasy series.
It's based on these great books that nobody seems to read.
It's great.
It's got betrayal, boobs, espionage, dragons.
Oh, wait, dragons?
Is that a spoiler?
I just started season one.
I don't start watching shows until they're so popular that watching them is no longer a statement.
So because you're three seasons behind, we have to live in a fantasy world where there's no such thing as dragons?
Do we also have to pretend that Lord Stevarios is still alive?
Thanks, Abed.
How about I just buy all the Bloodlines of Conquest books, read ahead, and spoil the whole series for you?
That's insane.
That's something an insane person would do.
Knuckleheads, focus.
Item one, the Greendale student census is out of date.
Britta, Abed, why don't you partner up on that one?
Give you a chance to squash this beef.
Next, the midterm dance is tonight.
Who wants to be on the decorating committee?
- Mm.
-  - Fine, I'll do it.
- I'll do it.
- I will be on that committee.
- Me too.
Are you guys volunteering because you think I'll do all the work?
- I wouldn't.
- No.
Not at all.
I don't care enough to lie, so no.
I will reward that honesty by giving you something easy.
A bulletin board fell down in the cafeteria a couple months ago.
Think you can get it hung back up?
- I'll give it a drive-by.
- Great.
We have now completed our first task, - "Have a Productive Meeting"!
-  For every task that we complete, a star goes on the task wall!
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said it can be here We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one, they all just fade away Oh, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Brince Ironstone's daughter is his mother!
Brince Ironstone's daughter is his mother!
Hi there.
What can I do for you?
Can you get me a drill, a couple of screws, - and a bulletin board?
- No, I cannot.
Okay, I tried.
Bye.
You wanna hang a bulletin board, you need to get a work order from the head janitor.
They get more powerful than you?
Hello, I'm taking the school census.
Please fill out this form, but don't talk to me.
I can't hear.
Are you deaf?
But you read lips?
Barbagarbagarba garbabarbabarba?
That was gibberish.
You're good.
I wish I knew sign language.
Are you going to have another intense burst of compatibility with a girl we never see again?
I can't hear you.
The midterm dance will need a visual theme, like "let's blow off steam," and it's trains.
- I have an idea.
- Chang, your last idea was to murder.
- Edison.
The bulletin board's a no-go.
- Really?
So you did your best, and this task just eludes you?
I have a lifetime of experience with red tape.
I know when to walk away.
- Yeah, you do.
- Hey, Edison.
The system is lazy.
I have integrity, too much to deal with any of it.
- I'll do it myself.
- And I would love to watch you try.
Okay.
I am on bulletin board duty.
You guys are in charge of the dance.
- Oh, Professor Pushpin!
-  Jerry, Carlo, Crazy Schmidt.
I'm Annie.
- You learned our names.
- I did.
Crazy Schmidt, how are C.J.'s clarinet lessons going?
Whoa.
Well, she's having a little trouble with his left finger lifts, but she's getting there.
Annie, do you want that bulletin board hung up?
Let me put in a work order for you.
There you go.
That should happen in three to six business months.
Any way we could bump that up a little, so it's somewhere above "Lower flag for Reagan's death"?
You gotta talk to a custodian for that, we're janitors.
There's a difference?
We were just starting to like you.
Had enough?
I'm just getting started.
What was your stumbling block, being nice?
Look, I admire your idealism, but my guess is that you will be crying uncle before that board ever goes up.
Game on, baby.
Come on, come on, come on.
What?
God.
This isn't over!
Here we go.
You wanted to get dirty.
This is where it starts.
Deputy Custodian Lapari, Annie Edison from the Save Greendale Committee, how's your daughter's soccer I'm sorry, this is a closed function.
We do not discuss business at custodial mixers.
But your daughter, soccer.
Daughter, soccer.
Yes, thanks for coming.
Hey, get a load of that wood burnt sign.
Did Mr. Whitney in woodshop make that for you guys?
Yes, that is a Whitney original.
Oh!
You know, I noticed that Whitney's bathroom has this amazing toilet.
Flushes like a DC-10 turbine.
Probably exceeds code, but what's wrong with a little friendship between departments?
Now how can our committee be your friend?
Bob?
Excuse me.
Chief Custodian Bob Waite, Buzz Hickey, Annie Edison.
Hickey and Edison, something in the job queue Bulletin board.
Yeah, we were hoping to get that up Let's take a walk.
That's quite a spread, Bob.
I'm impressed.
Well, it's election time.
If I don't break out the fancy sausages, my ass goes in the grinder next January.
Keeping my people happy, it's an uphill battle.
For example, look at this.
A lot of the websites we try and visit get blocked by this weird filter thing.
Now let's say I wanted to move a work order for a bulletin board from the bottom of the queue to the top.
Now how can I do that when I'm dealing with this?
They want their porn unblocked.
Then they'll give you your board.
That's what that was?
How did you know?
Did you investigate pornography when you were a cop?
- Eh, something like that.
- So he wants a bribe.
Welcome to the labyrinth, kid.
Only there ain't no puppets or bisexual rock stars down here.
And at the center of it all, if you're lucky, a piece of cork and a few pins.
So what, is it worth it?
Is that what a bulletin board is to you, Professor?
A piece of cork?
That's not what it is to people that lose their pets, people that need rides, people whose bad bands need bad bass players.
To them, every pushpin has the power to change the future.
So yes, Professor, it's worth it.
I know a lady in the I.T. Department.
Okay, I'll put some food on the tables, we'll lower the lights, and that's a midterm dance.
I guess it could use a little something theme-wise.
I have an idea.
"Bear Down for Midterms".
- What?
- "Bear Down for Midterms".
You can't just repeat it.
You need to explain yourself.
It's midterm time.
- Mm-hmm.
- People have to bear down, study hard, get to work.
It's "Bear Down for Midterms".
Is there a dot I'm not connecting?
- Uh-uh.
- It's a play on words.
- "Bear down" is an expression.
- I know the expression, Chang.
"Fly on the wall" is an expression, but if I want to pitch "Fly on the Wall for Midterms," you might ask, "What do you mean"?
Chang?
Are you crying?
I understand I've been crazy in the past, butthat doesn't make it any less frustrating to be completely dismissed like this.
I don't know if you guys even see me as human anymore.
I don't know if it's like a joke to you.
Are all Asian men like a joke?
If it's like a racial thing.
No!
No!
I've paid for my crimes.
Underneath all the craziness, I am still a human, and I I do want to make a difference and Can you respect that?
Please?
Chang What can we do here?
Bear Down for Midterms.
- Okay.
- Okay, well We'llput up some bear things?
We'll bear down.
For midterms.
Okay.
You want me to lift web restrictions solely for custodial?
They need to have full access, so they can research, um custodian stuff.
If the filter is mistakenly blocking a site, they just need to submit the url, and I can - Okay, what do you want?
- Excuse me?
Tell us what we can do for you so that you can do this for us.
Oh.
Cool.
I I didn't know it could work that way.
I guess I could use decent parking.
Right now they make me park in Annex B. Like a  lunch lady.
Our committee can talk to parking.
But, Debra, let's be clear.
I want everything to get through that porn blocker.
- What do you mean everything?
- Everything!
Understood.
I'm very happy right now.
- So just bears everywhere?
- Yep.
And then we'll have some cakes, party hats, birthday stuff!
This is coming together better than I thought.
I'm sorry, birthday stuff?
- Yes, Duncan.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
Birthday stuff.
Well, I've been sad to see that bulletin board down in the cafeteria for so long.
I've always had a passion for bulletins.
If parking for the I.T. guy puts that board back where it belongs, I won't stand in the way.
You know what you need speaking as a fan of bulletins you need to have the Dean appoint someone to oversee them, to make sure bulletins stay organized and protected.
I'll do it.
We could look into that.
Well, not to be that guy, but, uh You think you could look into that before I do this for you?
You want to control all the bulletin boards in the schoolwhy?
You might want to start talking turkey, Waldron, because the Macy's parade is almost over, and grandma's getting drunk.
Do you know where my department's power comes from, Miss Edison?
- Parking spaces.
- Wrong.
There was plenty of space to park in dinosaur times, but not one single parking department.
My power comes from a scarcity of parking, just like your dad's comes from a lack of hugs.
And you know what takes my power away?
Carpools.
Carpools organized through ride shares.
Ride shares posted on bulletin boards.
You can take the books off your head because we're done posturing.
You want me to talk turkey, well, gobble gobble.
I want ride shares gone.
- Let's get out of here.
- All right.
- What?
- I'll talk to the Dean.
I must say, I don't know what we did, but we sure did the hell out of it.
I guess the key to dance decoration is just pick an idea.
And then bear down.
Right, buddy?
Here are your sodas.
Ohmy God.
- Yeah, pretty great.
- Yeah.
Bear down, baby.
Too soon, you guys.
This is way too soon.
- Too soon for wha - Too soon for this!
After this morning in Wisconsin?
Bear breaks loose at a kid's birthday party, mauls a whole bunch of people?
Why am I explaining this when this is obviously a ghoulish reference to it?
The news has been covering it all morning!
That where I got the idea.
You know how sometimes you hear something and forget you heard it, but you think you came up with Oh, man.
This is bad.
We're in crisis mode now.
We really messed up, you guys.
An office of bulletin board oversight.
Ah, what a novel idea.
I'm gonna fill out this form right away.
But first, a toast.
To hanging a bulletin board Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
Uh, first time toasting?
Get in here, buddy.
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
I'm not saying that.
Ah, well, I hate to be that guy, but I'm not signing this form until Professor Hickey says "Easy peasy, lemon squeezy".
Damn it, Annie.
Don't do this.
Whatever you've got in your butt, can we get it out later?
When, after he signs it?
After it's all too late?
- Annie?
- You petty old man.
When we started this, I thought you'd get a taste of the system and spit it out, not open a bottling plant.
You're just like all the people that What?
The people that put you here?
The people in the big machine that made you fail?
You went from being a cop to teaching criminology because of the system, right?
Unfortunately for Greendale, you have to prove it by getting nothing done.
Well, here's a bulletin for you "Annie Edison doesn't get nothing done".
Yow.
And where should I put that bulletin, Edison, on a sham piece of cork controlled by a parking guy that lights his cigars on student ride shares?
My God, Annie.
What kind of labyrinth have you created?
Certainly not the magic kind with puppets and macho rock stars.
You whored yourself out, kid.
You wanted that board so bad that you made every board on campus worthless, and in doing so made the school just a shade dirtier.
I thought better of you, young lady.
Oh, man.
This got Sorkin-y.
Yeah, well, I didn't think anything in particular of you, and now I see why!
Okay, I didn't follow most of that, but it feels like I ought to do this.
Hmm?
Oh, hey, Annie.
Um What do you think?
"Fat Dog for Midterms"?
- Yeah!
- Pretty cool.
- I don't understand.
- It's an expression.
"Fat Dog for Midterm".
Like, don't sweat it, fat dog it.
Hang out, relax, like a fat dog.
Bah!
You can look it up on Wikipedia.
- There's an entry in there.
- Yep.
I neveruhokay.
I just I feel like I'm missing You know, Annie, um Sometimes it feels like you don't take us seriously.
Aww.
Yeah, I guess we bring it on ourselves, but it's still pretty frustrating.
Annie, is this a race thing?
- Race!
- No!
God, no!
You guys!
I accept that it's an expression, but I don't see the connection to You're overthinking, Annie.
It's decorating.
Just pick an idea and bear down on it.
Um, really poor choice of words, Ben Too soon.
But you guys are right.
I'm sorry.
I've had a really hard day.
I need to just fat dog this concept.
- Fat dog!
- Fat dog it, baby!
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Abed, but to the spoiler goes the victory.
But I really liked her.
She probably likes you too, but she also likes cash.
I'm devastated.
Now I feel bad.
But You learned a lesson, and I gave a differently abled person a job.
Oh, no, now I really feel bad.
Wait, no.
Come back!
Let's be fat dogs about this.
Hello.
What happened to you?
- Nothing.
You never called.
- I'm sorry.
That was the year of the gas leak, but I won't use that as an excuse.
I can be inconsiderate and a lot of other things.
Me too.
I guess I could've put in some effort.
Would you like to go to lunch sometime?
No, I'd like to go to dinner.
Now.
I can do that.
I started this coat check without permission anyway.
I could feel at the time There was no way of knowing Fallen leaves in the night Who can say where they're blowing As free as the wind Hopefully learning Why the sea on the tide Has no way of turning More than this You know there's nothing More than this  Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
Excuse me!
All right, all right!
Enough!
Let's go.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
Let's do it again!
There's a brand-new dance Based on an old phrase It's called the fat dog, and it will amaze You've heard this expression your entire life It's not made up, it's not made up There's a brand-new dance based on an old phrase It's called the fat dog, and it will amaze You've heard this expression It's a bear dance!

{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Jeff, we've known each other a long time, right?
You've come to respect me.
- Sure.
- Well, get ready to stop.
Please help me seduce Britta now that you've finished doing it with her.
Please, please Do you even really like Britta?
It seems like you like her because she doesn't like you.
Have you met the women that do like me, Jeff?
Neither have I, but trust me, they're bad people.
Fine.
To get near Britta, think like Britta.
Grab one of those free papers for hippies on the quad, go to the calendar page, and find a cause so tragic Are you writing this down?
Okay, we have confirmation that all the bones have been removed from the football field.
And we agree that teachers should get a 10-minute head start at the job fair.
Any other items?
It's Friday night.
What's everybody doing?
Oh, there's a benefit show at the Forefront Theater in Riverside for starving children with cleft palates.
Aw.
I'm gonna crash the premiere of the Kickpuncher reboot dressed like classic Kickpuncher.
They shouldn't have redesigned that costume.
Keep your heads in the sand if you want.
Professor Duncan, I didn't know that cause interested you.
Well, it's starving children with cleft palates, Britta.
What part would you have me be disinterested in?
- Forefront Theater?
- Mm-hmm.
What time?
I'm going.
- I'm going too.
- Me too.
Kids with cleft palates should have extra food, not less.
I'm in.
I have dinner plans.
Yeah, make sure it's a hearty meal.
- Oh, boo.
- Help me out here.
Um, well, uh Pfft, are you really the one that needs help here, Winger?
Yeah, should we write a check to the Jeff Foundation?
Okay.
Maybe I'll go too.
Well, it's the least you can do.
Yeah, feels good to help.
God bless you.
Cool, so 7:30?
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said it can be here We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one, they all just fade away Did you get it?
I don't think I got it.
Well, the ants were people.
The Queen Ant was an oil company.
Okay, so it was about our marginalized perceptions as drones being born into a corporate hive-mind?
- Yeah.
- Mm.
- Wow.
McDonald's?
- Oh, I was just thinking about that.
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm, hungry.
Hello?
Okay, Alessandra, I can't talk right now.
I just got out of a show.
Okay, hold on.
Well?
Look, if you're gonna just yell at me, why Why are you doing this?
This is not happening to you, okay?
It's happening to us!
Well, you called me!
Well, then let me be the one to do this!
Uh, my mother used to tell a story about how she killed a chicken.
Hong Kong, 1964.
So you like the theatre, Ian?
Oh, are you kidding?
I spent half my days at university in wigs and tights.
You don't do that without befriending some actors.
Hm.
Oh, my God, Michael.
I know Michael from my anarchist days.
God, he's gonna smell the sellout on me.
Hey.
How's it goin'?
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
What's going on?
I don't like this "my-kale" guy.
I don't think he likes himself, or he'd pronounce it "Michael".
Isn't she great?
She's everything I love about America.
Bold, opinionated, just past her peak, and starting to realize that she has to settle for less.
And the moment she needs a shoulder to cry on, bam.
Huh?
The Duncan handkerchief.
Well, I'm out.
Have fun circling my former lover, waiting for her to cry.
I tried to make that sound good, but that's what you're doin'.
Eh.
Uh, you're all heroes tonight for making a difference, but I want to introduce one of my heroes.
- Britta Perry.
- Oh.
She is the bravest, most passionate activist I have ever had the honor of imitating.
So, hey, buy her a drink.
Anything you wanna add, Britta?
Oh.
Wow, um, I'm not a hero.
I'm a high school dropout and a bartender, so don't listen to me.
Or anyone.
Just listen to yourself, and make sure you tell yourself the truth.
Well, it was it was great seeing you, so I might stay for one drink.
- Why?
- I like to drink.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
I have a serious problem.
That had better be true.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
I am Kickpuncher.
You are in violation of future law.
Pew!
Pew!
Pew!
Pew!
Pew!
Pew!
Oh.
Damn it, come on.
- What are you doing?
- What?
What what are you doing?
Making a costume for a movie premiere.
Annie banned glue guns from the apartment after an incident so hilarious that even describing it would narratively eclipse what's happening here.
- What's happening here?
- You and me bonding.
Check it out.
Tell me the truth: if you were a post-apocalyptic survivor I would raise goats, hoard cinnamon, and travel only at night.
But, please, I have some work to do here.
Just one thing.
Watch this.
Initiate ballistic foam.
Oops.
- What the hell?
- Sorry.
You just destroyed five hours of work!
- I'll clean it up.
- No, you don't touch it!
I know this is bad timing, but I should go if I'm gonna make the movie, so - What are you doing?
- Oh.
Something nobody ever does.
Teaching you consequences.
- But I have to go.
- But you can't.
Huh, isn't that crazy?
You ever been grounded?
You ever been punished?
Do you have any idea what it feels like to be refused something?
I know what it feels like when people try to control me.
You should know it never goes their way.
Ooh.
And what "kicky-punch" movie is that from?
The ones you've seen or the one I'm gonna watch you miss?
I said I was sorry.
I'm sorry I punched my landlord, but I'm not gettin' my deposit back.
That's an example of you being punished for choosing to hurt someone.
I wrecked your papers by accident.
You chose to spray this crap on purpose because you didn't care what happened.
You know, let me tell you something.
For five years, I have watched people walk around on your eggshells.
"Oh, Abed.
He's so imaginative, so magical.
"Everybody hide their hamburgers!
"If Abed sees a hamburger, we'll all travel in time.
"Let's eat cookies and ice cream and dress in pajamas in the middle of the day".
I watched my third wife die!
You think I'm spoiled?
And you think I'm spoiled because it's never occurred to anyone to do this?
You're not the Marco Polo of bullying me.
You're just another tourist taking pictures of a great, big wall.
Oh, you're gonna make me cry.
When's the last time someone physically limited you?
Oh, just now.
You physically ruined my drawings.
Drawings of what?
You're an artist?
I destroyed something valuable?
Looked like you were doodling chickens.
He is a duck!
Uh-oh.
Hey!
You're not allowed in there.
Well, I just did a one-man show for a little audience that would beg to disagree.
Audience?
In there?
We haven't had a single person or performance in that theater since the 1997 fire.
So what have you guys been up to?
Well, this.
Raising money.
Organizing.
Trying to make a difference.
I'm impressed, and embarrassed.
I sold out.
- We sold out.
- You did not sell out.
I'm going to community college to start a career.
We're in real estate.
We own the building we're standing in.
Wow.
You guys did sell out!
I know!
I should introduce myself to her friends.
I knew it!
You don't have a drinking problem!
You have feelings for Britta, you disgusting monster!
Fine.
Yes.
Something about everybody liking her turns me on.
It's a problem I have.
I hated Reese's pieces before E.T. ate them, sorry.
- You're a bad friend!
- That's not fair!
Wait, that's really not fair.
You're a terrible friend.
She was mine first.
And it's not like she belongs to anybody.
Oh, here we go.
"Love isn't a game," say the guys that always win.
And now, you're going to go pull a Dane Cook in one of those three movies he was in about Dane Cook getting laid by accident.
Only it's not a Dane Cook movie, Jeff, because this time, someone's watching: me.
Your friend, British Jason Biggs.
If you never call me Dane Cook again, I'll stand down for an hour.
Okay.
An hour.
Are your duck drawings a secret?
Is that why you do 'em when nobody's around?
Not that it's any of your business, but I am a cartoonist in my spare time.
My cartoon's about a duck.
I was drawing him.
Does the duck have a name?
Does he have powers?
I'm not pitching to you.
You're afraid I won't like it.
Sure.
I've been a cab driver, a soldier, a cop, but what terrifies me the most is the opinion of a manchild in cardboard pants.
Kickpuncher was a cop before he became a cyborg.
So you were a cop before you became this.
And what were you before this?
Were you normal?
Or do you act like this because somebody stuffed you in a locker?
Is that the idea?
Other way around.
What else do you want to know about me?
What makes you stop talking.
- Letting me go.
- After you miss your movie.
Because you want me to suffer.
For destroying your duck cartoons?
The ones you're ashamed of?
Uh, which one were you laughing at?
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop that!
You're ghosts!
We're ghosts?
The janitor out there told me you died in 1997.
Janitor?
Hey!
Those guys in there told me that you're the one that died in a fire and you're a ghost!
And you just believed 'em?
You just believed a bunch of ghosts?
Have you guys seen that billboard on Water Street for Consensual Perfume?
The one with the man chasing the woman through the grass and it says, "Proven in its field"?
Yeah, proven in its field and in labs on the eyeballs of rabbits.
We should make it say that!
Who's got the spray paint?
No, guys, I'm serious!
Doug and Janet, you're on lookout.
Michael works the ladder.
I will banksy that mother!
Come on, guys, we gotta start taking risks again.
Well, that's convenient for the one with nothing to lose.
Oh, so the person with the least wealth has the least valid argument?
That's convenient.
Britta, how many people have you fed this year besides yourself?
- Oh, Janet - No, look.
I've spent enough time feeling bad.
Fight the power!
- Would you like to go - Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh, my God.
These are really good.
It helps me to see why you were so upset.
Did I ruin anything as good as what's in here?
Ah, just practice drawings.
I have to practice drawing the duck from different angles.
It's hard when his back's turned 3/4 because of the beak.
Well I'm a real jerk for wrecking it.
Ah, you didn't do it on purpose.
That doesn't excuse my behavior.
No, I appreciate that.
It's a good apology.
You're a good kid.
All right.
Well I can see from the clock that if I hit all the green lights I'm sorry, I can't let you go.
That'd undercut the larger lesson.
Yes, the lesson being that you're very talented.
But I have this thing.
I can't walk into a movie You're not going to the movie.
Yes, I am.
- You need this.
- Let me go!
This is you learning.
You're a bad person and a bad cartoonist.
You go ahead.
Hurt my feelings.
Oh!
You have feelings, huh?
Have you considered putting them into your work?
Your cartoons are monuments to joylessness, nervously assembled jokes based on nothing from your life or anyone's life!
You're furious at me for being creative because you want to be able to create.
You have all this rage and shame and loneliness, which I don't even know how to feel much less understand, and you decide to put what on paper?
A duck.
Jim the Duck.
You think I'm crazy.
You think there's something wrong with me.
Jim the Duck?
Publishers are interested!
Oh!
Yeah, well, publishers are stupid.
Either that or you're misinterpreting what was probably a form letter.
- You shut up.
- You shut up.
- Now you shut up.
- You shut up.
Oh, are we yelling?
Are we yelling right now?
Yelling!
I'm yelling!
Yelling!
I'm yelling, I'm yelling, I'm yelling!
And you're not talented!
You made me miss my movie!
You made me miss my movie.
In the words of your hacky duck, "What the hell"?
Do you like music?
Everyone likes music.
What are you, a fish?
I have Ooh, I-I tell you what we could listen to.
Do you know Rimples and Splikket?
They were the British Laurel and Hardy.
Most of their stuff is timeless, but you do need to know that the prime minister went to Oxford, not Cambridge, as the sketch implies.
Are they speaking English?
Okay.
'80s German techno it is.
Do you have any friends?
I'm sorry?
I've been defining myself with reactions to and from other people my whole life.
Now I feel worthless just because I'm worthless in relation to my friends, which means they're not my friends.
Who are your friends?
Well, there's my neighbor, Pat.
I try to stay on his good side.
I owe him money.
Uh, Jeff.
I'd call you a friend.
Well, in fact, I'd call you a Oh, that's right.
You and Jeff have actually known each other longer than anybody, huh?
I always forget that.
I guess 'cause you guys don't really act like friends.
Yeah, I guess not so much.
Where are we going?
Well, I think you should go home because you're having an existential crisis, and the best lesson you could take away from it is that you are someone, even when you're by yourself.
I think you're right.
Thank you.
And please don't take offense at this, but thank you for not hitting on me.
I was just vulnerable enough to do something really stupid.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
It's nothing.
It's the the stupid steering wheel is on the wrong side of the car.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to show you something.
What's this?
It's a script I wrote about a cop on the edge.
Troy thought it was hilarious.
I didn't have the heart to tell him it wasn't a comedy.
Why are you giving this to me?
I know all the tricks and tropes of filmmaking, but what I'm missing is what I think the critics call "substance," which is you more than me.
You want to be film partners?
"It's time for Justice.
Police Justice".
Wait, the character's name is "Police Justice"?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I think I may be able to help.
I'm sorry for the stuff I said.
Me too.
Sit down.
You drink scotch?
- No.
- You're gonna.
Hey, handsome.
This stool taken?
Struck out, huh?
If that makes you feel better.
Or maybe I just realized that I was spending the whole night getting to third base with the wrong person.
You're a good friend, and I don't say that often enough.
That's really nice.
But you can't have sex with me.
How about we have these drinks and then not have sex, with anyone, together?
Sounds good.
Cheers.
So a 9-millimeter's actually better than a 10-millimeter?
Millimeter don't make no difference.
Bullets just kinda kill you.
"Bullets just kinda kill you".
Are you quoting something?
Can I use that?
Yeah.
You left your handkerchief at my place last night.
- Ah!
- We had a boys' night.
A bottle of booze, an argument about sports cars.
And I cut my hand trying to prove that I can whittle.
Me too.
Oh, hey.
- How was your night?
- Great.
I had a monumental evening by myself.
- Oh!
- Oh Almost feel left out.
Well, we've had our share of focus lately.
Mm-hmm.
Speak for yourself.
Uh-oh.
I'm fine.
I just, um Do you guys believe in ghosts?
And if you do, do you believe what those ghosts tell you about other ghosts?
Chang, you cannot be on the committee if you're going to be actively insane.
I'm not insane.
I swear.
I just, um had a weird experience at the theater last night.
- You were there?
- Yeah, you were there?
What do you mean?
Of course I was.
Huh, I guess we just didn't see you.
Well, the ants were people.
The Queen Ant was an oil company.
What if I don't exist?
Oh, I got this.
I had a very similar night last night.
Go home, light some candles, and take a bath.
Okay, coolsies.
__ Hey!
I was thinking off-campus lunch.
What's that Tex-Mex place you mentioned?
Salsa Von Taco's?
Read my mind!
Oh.
Oh!
- No, no.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
- Nah.
- Oh, okay.
Yeah.
- Oh.
- No, wha Let's - No.
- No, no, no.
- Well O-okay.
- Ah - You you just - Eh - Ah.
Oh, okay.
- Ah - I - Wha I-I just don't like being left behind!
My father got drunk in pubs and left me in my room with nothing!
- So did mine!
- Oh, why would he do that?
Why do they do that?
- Why?
- Why do they do that?
I-I won't go to that Tex-Mex place.
Oh, that's all I wanted you to say.
- Hmm?
- Hmm?
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Okay, we'll get an estimate on adding grass to the soccer field.
Good meeting.
Oh, Jeff, what time's dinner?
Uh, dinner?
Jeff, you didn't invite Shirley?
Well, it's Tuesday.
Shirley always goes to Elijah's karate practice on Tuesdays.
It's okay.
Part of making sacrifices for my loved ones is not expecting my loved ones to make sacrifices.
Aw.
- I can do tomorrow.
- I can't.
I'm free on Fridays and Mondays We're not moving it!
When Shirley can have dinner, we'll have another dinner, because it's just dinner.
And there's no need to manipulate each other.
You know that's what you do.
You know you're doing it now with that face.
You don't like my face?
Aw.
Hello, Save Greendale Committee.
This is David and Bixel.
They're app designers.
They'd like to beta test their latest social-networking app on our campus, which could be good for us.
Look what Facebook did for Harvard, right?
Hey, guys.
Bixel and I would like to introduce you to a little app called MeowMeowBeenz.
- Ooh.
- MeowMeowBeenz let's you say how much you like, who you like, when you like, all from a standard non-boost mobile phone.
Let's see how it works.
Bixel, what did you think of the way the Dean introduced us?
I thought he did great.
That's why I'm giving him five MeowMeowBeenz.
Aw.
Well, Bixel, I'm sorry, but I thought his intro was just okay.
That's why I'm gonna give him two out of five MeowMeowBeenz.
My MeowMeowBeenz.
With MeowMeowBeenz, students can rate teachers.
Teachers can rate students.
Everyone and anyone can rate each other.
MeowMeowBeenz.
You know I could I fought for this country, and I know you don't get to pick and choose the parts you fight for, but I know I should go number two soon.
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said it can be here We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one, they all just fade away __ Hurry up!
I'm late for Human Rights class.
I'm sorry.
Why is Starburns carrying Garrett's books?
It's like toast bossing crackers around.
I mean, I guess.
Garrett's got three MeowMeowBeenz.
- Starburns is a Two.
- Are you telling me people are actually using this stupid app?
- It's addictively effective.
- No, it's effectively stupid.
There already was a rating system in place called "cool people get more," and it was working fine.
MeowMeowBeenz takes everything subjective and unspoken about human interaction and reduces it to explicit, objective numbers.
I've never felt more alive.
As long as you're happy, I'm unsettled.
- Hey, guys.
- What happened to you?
I sat on a toilet so long, my feet fell asleep, then I noticed limping was getting MeowMeowBeenz, so I just kind of started committing.
Did you understand a word he said?
Mm-hmm.
Hey, here you go.
Here you go.
Nobody is gonna down-vote a guy on his birthday.
Wait.
Are you using MeowMeowBeenz?
If you can't kill it, join it.
When you get older, you're gonna see the warning signs.
Mark Zuckerberg is Fidel Castro in flip-flops.
MeowMeowBeenz is gonna make East Berlin look like Woodstock.
You take my word for that.
Do you own stock in Trivial Pursuit's Baby Boom Edition?
Britta.
Please tell me you're not using this app.
Uh, I liked the idea at first, giving a voice to the unheard, but then Annie just told me that the rating system is exponentially weighted.
As your ratings go up, your ratings of other people - become more important.
- No.
It just means the more others like you, the more likeable you can make others.
It makes sense to me.
You know who else it made sense to?
Say "Hitler" one more time, and I'm giving you a two.
Jeff, are you not registered?
The longer you wait, the harder it's gonna be to get your number up.
Annie!
Listen to yourself.
You're learning its language.
You're letting a video game play you.
I got to set these people straight.
Hey, hey, uh Students of Greendale!
We don't have to worship a calculator!
There is no formula for people!
Oh.
You're punishing me for being alive!
That's the general idea, baby.
You're gonna think I'm joking, but you were getting through to me more with mustard on your lip.
- Oh, shut up.
- He's not kidding, Britta.
I thought I was imagining it.
When you had mustard on your lip, I was more open to your opinion.
Maybe it dilutes or distracts from your excessive intensity.
Maybe it dilutes or distracts from your stupid butt.
Hmm.
How you doing, Rog?
Hey, Charlotte.
I see what you did there.
Vicki, I love this.
Shirley's a Five.
- How?
- She's nice to people, Jeff.
You know Shirley.
Oh, Vicki, thank you.
Did you just give me four MeowMeowBeenz?
Um I love my four from Vicki.
No!
Stop it!
I didn't mean it.
Yeah.
I do know Shirley.
Oh!
We should be having brownies.
I'm going to help Shirley.
Not a bad idea for you, Britta.
She could make you a Two again.
Screw your Twos, and screw MeowMeowBeenz.
I know that's your One talking.
What are you doing?
Registering for MeowMeowBeenz.
I'm gonna become a Five and expose this thing for the sham it is.
Oh, now you're speaking my language.
That's unintentional, trust me.
Mm.
Just make sure you know the real reason you're doing something, or you'll fail before you start.
That's actually a good point.
It is?
Why?
Oh, come on!
__ So I'm like, "That's two cups," and she's like, "What"?
I'm like, "Two cups, balls back, tops off".
All right, Trent, Mulch, Dave, Herpie, Clutch, Dirt Mouth, Rope, Tingles, Cat Woman, Steve.
All right, keep it floppy.
Haul it, ball it, never call it.
Girls are objects.
Yeah!
Two MeowMeowBeenz.
Congratulations.
Abed was just explaining that the Fives get to choose what setting the air conditioning is on.
Yep.
Is it me, or are more people wearing gray.
I feel like I'm in a commercial, and someone's about to hand me a Starburst.
Threes and Twos tend to wear neutral colors.
Looking like you want to move up can get you moved down.
- Abed, hey.
Come here.
- Hi.
Those are other Threes.
We talk about how we're glad we're not Twos.
Small talk, guys.
I make small talk now.
Hello, Jeffrey.
I see you decided to join MeowMeowBeenz.
Oh, it's a great tool for living.
- You look great.
- You look great.
- You know what you're doing.
- You know what you're doing.
I'm watching you, okay?
- Mm, mm.
- Mm, mm.
Yeah, you'll be watching my hinder, mama, and choking on its billowing plume of highly rated dust.
__ Whoa, whoa, whoa, Fours and above only.
These are snacks for the Fives.
Yeah?
You're a two.
Leonard, would you rather a Three serve the Fives food?
No.
It is no secret that the Threes and Twos are growing suspicious of the Fours and Fives.
All I know is that it's my birthday.
What if we give these people something to believe in again?
- Koogler?
- Hey.
I know what you guys think of me, okay?
"Hey, it's Koogler".
You know.
"He's cool".
"He likes to get laid.
He's not that old".
But I'm a Five because I know what the Twos and the Threes need.
What do we all need?
Entertainment.
A talent show.
An event where Threes and Twos can rise and fall.
It helps people believe in the system.
Give my spot to someone else.
I don't want to be a Five.
I was happy as a Three.
I'm miserable.
Oh, dear Abed.
So humble.
You people are monsters.
Well, if there's nothing else, then Speak.
Headline items A few Twos broke into a supply closet and stole a box of peanut butter.
The futurization of the campus decor is almost complete.
And a few hours ago, Jeff Winger became a Four.
That's nice.
__ You there, girl.
How many MeowMeowBeenz?
Two!
Two?
Are you lost, Two?
Yes.
Are you lost, Two?
I'll escort her to the common area.
You're a Four?
I don't recognize you.
He's new Beenz.
Bye-bye, new Beenz.
Threes and Twos must leave building one after 7:00.
Building one after 7:00 is Fours only.
- What are you doing here?
- How goes the revolution?
I can't break a Four.
It's impossible to get any higher without half the Fives in your corner.
They got this thing locked up.
Yeah, but they're nervous.
They're hosting a talent show to prove that anyone can be a Five.
If you enter it, you'll be center stage with all eyes on you, and you can tell everyone this isn't democracy.
This is tyranny.
I'm sorry.
Can you put some mustard I shouldn't have to put mustard on my face for this to make sense.
You know we have to take this system down.
You know I once loved a Two.
Matthew He was my everything.
But numbers change.
I'll keep your secret, new Beenz.
It says you're next.
Now, Jeffrey, I beg you not to take this risk.
You know what they say.
Fives have lives, Fours have chores, Threes have fleas, Twos have blues, and Ones don't get a rhyme because they're garbage.
Craig, I got this.
No!
No, please!
Not the Outlands!
Please!
Boo on you!
The Fives have spoken!
And you uh are not very good and What?
No!
Please!
I'm just not very good at public speaking and Last chance, Jeffrey.
Showtime.
My name is Jeff Winger.
I recently became a Four.
Funny thing is, when I was a Two, I didn't actually have any less.
But I did have a lot of crazy friends.
Hey, my name's Tommy Talouca.
I'm from hallway "C".
I'm a Two!
I got to get to the cafeteria before they run out of apples!
What is with Twos and apples?
You're given three kinds of fruit.
Mix it up.
Then you become a Four.
And you get that, uh that Four walk.
You know what I'm talking about?
It's like this.
It's like one of these.
And they got a little trail of Twos behind them, and they're like "Hey, is there an apple up there"?
Oh, .
Wow.
What else is going on?
- He's killing it.
- Shh!
There came a time when I has to a "aks" myself, did I even want to be a Three?
Or did I just hate myself for being a Two?
I don't know.
All I know is I sure do love them apples!
Oh, the Koog "approogs".
That's a five!
Yeah!
Review.
Review meow meow meow meow meow!
Review.
Review meow meow meow meow meow.
Down here, guys.
Yeah, yeah.
Can I get a picture?
I want my future kids to know this happened.
I admire your optimism, Garrett.
- What the hell?
- I don't want to hear it.
I got this far because I need to take Shirley down.
- What about everyone else?
- Look around you, Britta.
Everyone wanted this.
Fives only, ma'am.
Oh, great.
Come on.
You you think this system's gonna last forever?
I'm gonna free people's minds.
I'm a Psych major.
Words are my weapons.
I'm a security guard.
Weapons are my weapons.
Welcome, Fives, to the inaugural fancy future dance.
I'm glad you don't think making Jeff a Five was a mistake like everybody else.
I believe in taking risks.
Yeah!
Jeff's really cool.
Couldn't help but notice that Shirley didn't clap with the rest of you after my performance.
Is she always so different?
If you talk to me, I can't concentrate on the dance moves.
You don't believe the rumors, do you, Koogler, that Jeff manipulated his way to the top?
Shirley, I can hear what you're saying.
You're trying to manipulate someone into thinking I'm manipulative.
I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about.
No one ever knows what you're talking about because you never say what you mean.
Do you want to have this conversation, or do you want to just keep flexing your veiny arms and throwing out apples?
Tranquility is advancement.
A happy Three is a future Four.
Twos and Threes, you're accepting a life you don't have to live!
Stand up for yourselves!
Really?
Ugh, fine.
- Give me that.
- Hey!
You're all alive!
You are all alive!
Look at the mustard on my face, but listen to my words.
You're one of the angriest, most vindictive You're the angry one, because the rules got changed on you, Winger.
You can't just be cool and be in charge now.
No, you have to gossip and give out food - and make people feel guilty.
- Okay, yeah.
I bust my ass making a world full of selfish idiots - remember my name!
- Fine.
Call it hard work, but don't tell me the system measures who's nice.
Actually, it kind of does.
Security, banish them to the Outlands with the rest of the Ones!
- Oh, no!
- Ow!
- Okay, okay, okay.
- No!
No!
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your tray tables in their party positions So sayeth Captain Koogler.
Actually, keep the tray tables where they are, Koogler.
The rule of the Fives is over!
Long live the review-lution!
- No!
- That comes down?
- Okay, okay, all right, all right.
- Whoa!
- Happy?
- Are you happy?
Look, I knew you couldn't go to that stupid dinner.
That's why I didn't invite you.
It's nice to be invited anyway.
Sure, if you're a control freak.
Oh, and you clearly hate control.
No.
I love it.
I guess it's easy to pretend that you don't when you got it.
You'd think we'd be better friends because we're both such big fans of the same thing.
You there!
Ones!
You are permitted back indoors by decree of Britta, the mother of Ones.
And do I hear correctly that as a Five, you felt you could park in handicap spots?
Well, you see, that's just part of the Koogler style.
It's human crap style.
Rate him!
Okay, well, that's low.
All Fives must be cleansed of their Five filth and reduced to oneness.
Jeff.
Hey, Shirley.
I'm not a Five anymore.
I'm a one like everyone else.
I'm like everyone else.
Who's next?
All right, time to pull the plug.
Mm.
Oh, great mother of Ones, mustard-faced savior, there is still a Five hiding among us that has not been cleansed.
Nonsense.
All Fives were reduced to oneness in the great purge of about two minutes ago.
This Five cheats.
It never registered, yet was given a five from outside the system.
Behold The MeowMeowBeenz app.
Its beta test ended days ago.
It's now available in the app store 99 cents.
Five stars.
This five lied to us, used us, judged us, yet exempts itself from judgment.
And I'm pretty sure it's selling our information to spammers because I am getting a lot more email, and trust me, my penis needs no enlargement.
So how do you cleanse a Five that's unregistered?
Delete it.
By the way, guys, it's a Saturday.
Um, you're all in school for nothing.
Go home and get some sleep.
No!
No.
Wait.
No, don't go!
Where are you going?
No.
Attention, Greendale.
I'd like to propose we basically forget everything that happened over the last few days.
And I don't anticipate a lot of pushback on that.
I think we're all pretty embarrassed.
- Hey, there.
- Oh, hey.
So I was thinking about checking out this new restaurant tonight.
Oh, that's sweet, but I can't tonight.
Not even takeout?
We could eat in the study room.
Oh, I think I have time for that.
Jeffrey.
What?
I'm not gonna take it off.
I still got two days left on the rental.
Every once in a while, a film comes along that takes a serious look at higher education.
This is not one of them.
Gentlemen Assume the party.
This summer fun has a new name.
- Koogler?
- Koogler!
- Koogler.
- Koogler!
Koogler!
Koogler!
Koogler!
Hope you don't mind if I play through.
Hammer Road Pictures invited you to meet the man the myth I'm photocopying my rear end.
the Koogler.
Koogler.
I guess I have what you might call an aversion to education.
Do you even have a career plan?
Yeah, uh, does getting laid count?
No!
Mitchell D. Hurwitz is Koogler Rated "R".
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
It's settled.
The urinals in the women's restroom will be turned into planters.
Onto chores.
We need some able bodies to clear out a space in the east hall's storage room.
- I'll do it.
- Really?
Yeah, Annie always goes from the easy chores to the hardest.
That's true, isn't it?
- I'll do it too.
- Yeah, me too.
Okay, that concludes this meeting.
- Oh!
- Aw, man!
Nobody picks up on my patterns!
What am I gonna say next?
Graham cracker!
You didn't know.
Hey, it's the "aww couple".
Aww.
Look what Rachel got me: Pile of Bullets.
An interactive Old West-themed VCR game from the '90s.
I found it at goodwill.
It was between a Thighmaster and a Dick Tracy Burger King glass.
- Happy anniversary.
- Anniversary?
I guess I should learn your name, young lady.
Oh, Rachel.
Rachel.
Nice to meet you, Rachel.
- You can go.
- Okay.
- Aww!
- Anniversary?
Yeah, Rachel and I have been dating for one of your months, but our relationship is 12 times more efficient, so it's really been a year.
Our sleep cycles are in synch, we can communicate with our eyebrows, and she knows my Netflix password Jeff's Netflix password.
Damn it.
I'm changing that.
- I changed it.
- To what?
Nice try.
Annie, can Rachel come to our place to play this tonight?
I can't afford to take her anywhere.
Well, my brother's in town for the week, and I'm broke too, so I was gonna make him dinner tonight.
Cool.
Double date?
Dinner and 1993 interactive VCR game?
- What are you making?
- Salmon.
Buttered noodles.
Buttered noodles are my favorite.
- Hmm.
- Ah!
Quick announcement for two of Greendale's finest.
Payday is postponed until next week.
So this is my freestyle rap apology.
Well, I'm a peanut bar And I'm here to say Your checks will arrive on another day Another day, another dime, another rhyme, another dollar Another stuffed shirt with another white collar Criminals, Wall Street, taking the pie And all the black man gets is a plate of white lies Prisons!
Recruitin' 'em!
Police be shootin' them Rap artists lootin' them, labels all dilutin' them Barack Obama is scared of me 'Cause I don't swallow knowledge And I spit it for free Let me clear my throat, ah-ha, ah-ha I don't know what that was, I don't.
I don't know what that was.
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said it can be here We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one, they all just fade away So nice to have the Edison kids under one roof again.
Remember when we used to cut carrots for mom?
Yes.
- I need a soda.
- Oh, okay.
One, two, three.
Door's busted.
Landlord's in jail and money's tight.
Yeah.
Oh, my God!
Anthony!
Thank you!
Yeah.
- Hey, Abed, a quick word.
- Hmm.
What would you think about my brother moving in with us?
Do I just keep cutting carrots?
Yes, Anthony!
- He has money.
He's handy.
- You're putting me on the spot.
I guess my knee-jerk concern would be that he's a Viking and might only use our home as a temporary base before moving inland where lumber is more plentiful.
He's a good guy.
We can't afford to keep splitting the rent two ways.
You have a better idea?
- How about Rachel?
- Is that a joke?
Is it cool if I poop?
No, Anthony!
Just cut the carrots!
You've been dating Rachel for a month.
I don't think you heard his question.
The answer is yes!
Rachel and I have been dating for the equivalent of a year.
Oh, really?
'Cause I feel like I've been hearing about that for two years.
You can't just microwave a relationship like it's a bean burrito.
I ain't living with your month-long girlfriend, brah.
Well, I ain't living with your wack-ass, don't-know-whether-to-keep-cutting-carrots- or-ask-if-he-can-take-a-poop-brother.
Can we discuss this later?
Rachel's on her way, and I'd like to practice my smile.
I guess it was just air.
Why are we organizing a storage room?
- How is this not a janitor's job?
- Can I ask you something?
Why the hell do you have all those muscles if you're gonna bitch about moving boxes?
Is the air working in here?
I'm sweating like a Catholic on Judgment Day.
Just a little protestant humor.
- I've got more.
- Oh, can't wait.
Nothin'.
Wait, there's something in there blocking the vent.
You gonna open it?
You do realize nothing good has ever been found in a vent, right?
It's a vent.
Whoa.
Huh.
Oh!
Intro to Chemistry.
Third edition.
Mint.
$200 retail.
Why are there books in an air duct?
Why is there hot sauce in the bathroom?
- It's Greendale.
- They must be stolen.
- We have to tell the Dean.
- Hold on.
Let's just calm down and have a slow, pleasant chat - about possibilities.
- What kind?
All kinds.
Anything is possible.
We might one day have hover cars.
Kale might be poisonous.
And we might not have to get the Dean involved here.
- Jeffrey, these are stolen!
- From who?
By who?
How long ago?
It's "from whom," "by whom".
But he nailed the third question.
Look, we are the committee that deals with Greendale's problems.
Now did you see anything on our list about a pile of missing books that are worth more than the school they're hidden in?
One thing's for sure.
If we hand these over, they'll really go missing.
And you think that money's gonna be used to cut our paychecks or to make another rapping peanut costume?
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Fine.
You wanna go to heaven?
- Walk away, more for us.
- I'm an accomplice now!
If I walk away, I'll only get into heaven by turning you in.
But what about your restaurant?
What about your kids?
Ms. Bennett, when God talks to you, what language does he use?
Because in my experience, when he thinks you deserve something, he drops it on you like a ton of bricks.
Okay.
All right.
But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do this clean and safe.
We're gonna move these to my restaurant in bread carts, and we're gonna sit on 'em until we know they're cold.
Then we're gonna price them through a third party, and we're gonna unload them in a single score.
None of that nickel-and-dime crap.
I don't wanna leave a trail.
- Yeah, great.
- Wonderful.
Okay, let's count these babies up.
Yeah, great.
When we were kids, Anthony and I would play Time Machine.
We would go, "Oh, no!
We're in Barbarian times!
Quick!
Back to the Time Machine"!
And then we would run back to the Time Machine.
It's true.
I bet that's why Abed is like a brother to me.
You guys are so alike.
I can't accept that based on one time-machine story.
Rachel, did you tell Annie about your Waterpik?
I suppose now is as good a time as any.
- I own a Waterpik.
- Annie has one too.
You guys both care for your teeth the same amount.
If you shared a bathroom, it'd go pretty smoothly.
Anthony said he could fix our cabinets.
Rachel used to mop floors when she worked at Kmart.
Is this a real conversation or are we being bugged by the feds?
Abed.
Sidebar.
What do you think happens after you die?
I don't know.
You're lucky.
- Stop trying to sell me on Rachel.
- Stop pitching Anthony so hard.
You're like ice cream cake out there overkill.
We need a roommate.
We're broke.
- I vote for Rachel.
- I vote for Anthony.
- Flip a coin?
- No.
Coins create parallel timelines.
- Rock, paper, scissors?
- That's a nine-sided coin.
What about Pile of Bullets?
You wanna decide on a roommate with a 1993 Old West-themed VCR game?
If Rachel or I win, Rachel moves in.
If you or Anthony win, I'll politely surrender and count down the days until he eats me.
All right, it's settled.
- Is this working?
- It's a handshake in progress.
Who wants to play Pile of Bullets?
- Not me.
- You have to.
- Oh, it's okay, we don't have to.
- It's not okay.
We do have to.
We all have to, and one day we'll tell you why.
But for now, let's simply retire to the TV area.
For the highest stakes of your entire young adult lives.
Okay, let's see what you got.
Yeah.
Okay.
I know somebody that knows people.
I can get you a price per book, find a buyer, and make a deal.
- For half.
- That's ridiculous.
I'm assuming more than half the risk.
- Half is fair.
- Not really.
Because they're ours, all 100% of them.
Giving you half is not fair, it's silly.
Okay, good luck.
You wanna re-blindfold me?
I know we're in E-9 in the east wing.
I know that because it smells like weed.
Not my weed.
Look, I'm willing to give her half.
Hear that, Britta?
You can have half of Jeff's share.
That's not what I meant.
That's what you're offering by giving her half of the total.
Either she can get half of all of our money or she can get half of your share.
Either way, you walk away with about 16%.
- That's not fair.
- Damn right.
Here's what is: Take it or leave it, Britta.
Legalize it Don't Chang Hey, guys.
Hey.
Look, if something sketchy is happening, I don't care.
So I'm just gonna back out of the room now and He can't leave.
No!
No!
I didn't see anything.
I did not see anything!
- Britta, find some rope.
- I've got rope.
"Each player starts with six bullet tokens, ten gold certificates, and a color-coded posse token".
There's two types of tokens?
I'm sure we'll figure it out.
Howdy!
You look like a real group of gunslingers.
Everyone in town's mighty scared, what with all the gold and the outlaws.
But only one of us can make it out alive.
Are we robbing the town?
By now, you should have your bullets, your gold, and two Wild West tokens each.
Hang onto those tokens no matter what.
- There's two kinds of tokens.
- Two each?
Now when you hear the word "draw," or when you see a square with a color or number matching one of you or your opponent's cards, the first one of you to say, "bang," wins the challenged player's token and the amount of their bid in gold!
- What's going on?
- Shh!
- Ready?
- Yes?
- I'm not.
- Shh!
- Are we supposed to be bidding?
- Draw!
- I bid!
- Pow!
Bang!
Rattler!
Bang!
5!
- Bang?
- Yee-haw!
- Bang-bang!
5!
- Bang?
Not bad!
Collect your tokens and let's get on to the next round!
What are you doing?
Stop that.
He said, "Collect your tokens".
He can't see you.
Didn't Abed shoot whoever's 5?
- Draw!
- Bang!
Bang!
Bang!
Bang!
Odd-numbered players, give up two cards!
- Draw!
- We have numbers?
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
Okay, okay, I don't think we're doing this right.
Are we sure this is a game and not some art film?
- Now what do we do?
- We rewind it and start over.
- Okay, I'll allow it.
- No, it's okay.
We gave it our best shot, no?
I'm sorry, Rachel, is this your home?
Oh, God, no, I'm sorry.
- Well, this is what we're playing.
- But it doesn't make any sense.
Oh!
It sounds like Anthony wants to forfeit.
- He doesn't.
Don't forfeit, Anthony.
- Rachel, we can do this.
Just focus, okay?
- Okay - Okay.
- Howdy!
- Howdy.
I love textbooks.
That's why I stole these.
- All right, knock it off.
- What?
You gotta make it sound believable or you're not getting outta here.
- I'm trying.
- Try harder!
Go.
I love textbooks.
That's why I stole them.
Mm.
Look at this one.
Stolen textbooks are the best kind.
I stole all these books and put 'em in this room so I could come kiss them.
That's all, thank you.
Please, I'm on parole!
Exactly.
So keep your mouth shut or we'll send this file to everybody.
What do you mean "everybody"?
Everybody!
- Look, I can't do this anymore.
- What?
I'm out.
It's too far, it's too evil.
Look, you guys can split the money.
I'm just gonna leave quietly.
Good-bye.
What the hell?
- Yeah?
- What the hell?
Ow!
I can't let you leave until we're done with this deal.
Shirley, this is not what God wants you to be doing today!
We had our chance to think about that.
He dropped this on us like a ton of bricks.
Right, Hickey?
Oh, yeah, definitely.
Not to say that this isn't getting insane.
Blackhat Bill sure ain't the forgivin' type.
- You!
Green player!
- Yes, partner?
You can do better than that, can't you?
Yes, pard-ner!
Pick another player that you want to draw a cactus card.
I choose Anthony!
Anthony, draw a card.
Oh!
This is a good one.
Keep this for when you're in a quick draw.
- Rachel, your turn!
- What do I do?
You roll, you roll.
Here.
- There.
My turn.
- Stop!
Snake bite!
Lose a turn.
- Anti-venom.
- I'll take two.
- Draw!
- Bang!
- Okay, I bid 5 bullets.
- I raise 6.
- 11.
- Pass.
Reverse!
- Hold it!
Yee-haw!
Did you remember to say "yee-haw"?
Anyone that didn't loses a turn.
Collect your coins!
Anthony, I'll trade you two snakes for a bullet.
- Just say yes!
- I don't wanna die.
- Stop her, Rachel, stop her!
- Bang?
No!
Bid 5!
- Tornado!
- Tornado!
Pass!
7!
- Reverse!
- 2 tornado!
- Pass!
- Double!
- Draw!
- Bang!
Oh, come on.
- You son of a bitch!
- Come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on!
If one of you rolled your bullet number, you're the winner!
Fast-forward to the red screen to get your gold.
Well, more food for the buzzards.
Looks like modern times have come after all.
See ya in the city.
I wanna go home.
- Me too.
- No, we have to play again.
Abed, I think you're having one of your special times, okay?
So I'm gonna give you some space.
I don't want space.
I want you to move in here.
- What?
- But that's not resolved!
- Anthony might move in, so - What?
We want one of you to live with us.
Yeah, we're settling it with a game of Pile of Bullets.
That is not an explanation that should make anybody want to live here.
Abed, I don't like this side of you, and I do not like that side of VCR technology.
I am glad that it's a dead medium.
That was very uncomfortable.
I don't really know how girlfriends work, but I don't think you have one anymore.
Okay, cool.
See you there.
I'm meeting my guy in an hour.
He wants to see a sample, set a price, and then we'll do the exchange.
Oh, brother.
So Britta doesn't know how much she's getting from this guy that none of us will ever see again.
But she knows one thing for sure: She'll be right back with it so you can divvy it up, even Steven.
Oh, man, that is rich.
What's supposed to stop her from robbing you guys blind?
What are you gonna do, call the cops?
- I'll go with her.
- Oh, yeah.
Good plan.
Yeah, leave Hickey here, and the two of you do the deal.
Yeah, what the hell?
When did I volunteer for Guantanamo duty while you two traipse off to the Cuban equivalent of Las Vegas?
Havana, right?
Guys, don't listen to Jeff.
He's just trying to divide us.
Says the woman who's willing to take care of the cash by herself.
As if you're Mr. Trustworthy.
Why do you have so much access to rope?
Hey, you're the one who left the door unlocked so Chang could get in here.
How do I know you didn't do that on purpose?
Guys.
Guys!
Calm down.
I'm sure we can work this out.
We just need to stay cool and talk it through.
I'm sorry.
That didn't work out the way I planned.
I'm sorry.
But you didn't leave me any choice.
You were acting very poorly, I didn't know if I could trust you anymore!
You dragged me into this.
I didn't want this.
Huh?
- You're packing?
- Yeah.
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.
- Because of last night?
- Yeah.
I just think there's some unresolved issues here.
You're right.
I'm still really hurt by mom turning her back on me when I went to rehab.
And I guess part of me was mad at you for siding with her, so I thought you moving in here was some kind of moral victory.
What?
No.
I mean unresolved issues involving the black guy in all these photographs.
- Troy?
- Hey, I don't know his name, man.
I just know he's clearly left some kind of vacuum.
And screw you.
What did I have to do with mom?
I was 13.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I'm here to do my third-act apology.
- Abed, I don't think - Wait.
Don't reject it until the whole thing's been served up.
Dobry.
Open your locker please.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I wanna tell you something.
- Abed, this is adorable.
Just because it's adorable doesn't mean it's not important.
Listen.
I've been accelerating our relationship because I've been worried I wouldn't pass a lot of the tests.
I wanted you to move in because I thought if Annie was around, I'd have less chance of screwing things up.
You're not screwing things up, though.
That's good to know.
But the problem with me will always be that I can never know for sure.
There's not a huge amount of people in my life that haven't eventually kicked me out, and I don't always see it coming.
I don't want it to happen with you.
Well, don't manipulate me and don't keep secrets from me and we'll probably be okay.
Cool.
It stopped raining.
Yeah, it sure did.
Aww, you hired a stunt person.
No, I did not.
Where'd you get these?
They were an inheritance from my father.
- He was a collector.
- Mmhmm.
- How many?
- 120.
Well, for the whole bunch, maybe 20.
- Thousand?
- Dollars.
- $20,000?
- 20 non-thousand dollars.
You might get that from a recycling place.
These are misprints, honey.
Check out page 105.
Well, I can't because there's no page numbers.
Ah!
Well, that would be a problem.
You know, "Class, turn to page" There is no page Oh, well, if there's no page number, you can't turn to it.
I've better things to do with my life.
Although we haven't been saying it, Troy was an important part of our apartment.
- He kept the peace.
- Yeah.
Goin' a little crazy without him.
Maybe we need to live with a therapist.
Or at least someone crazier than us.
- Let's give Craigslist another try.
- I think Craigslist is the way to go.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Yeah.
Are you guys all wearing the same clothes from yesterday?
We've been through some stuff.
But we learned something.
No, we didn't.
We learned that sometimes there's no lesson.
- How is that learning?
- We played Pile of Bullets.
Can we just get this meeting over with?
- So how'd the cleanup go?
- I learned how to smile.
Don't step, don't step to me.
I like coffee and water, don't step to me.
Uh, damn it!
I lost it.
I lost it!
Okay.
I will get back to you.
Thanks.
- Who was that, sweetie?
- Guess they want me for that Wild West videotape board game thing.
- Pile of Bullets?
- Yeah.
Devin, you pick up that phone right now and you call these people and you tell 'em you want this part.
These VCR games is where everything is headed.
Can't you see that?
You just became the Luke Skywalker of the new Star Wars.
- We've gotta move.
- We do?
Oh, yes, indeedy.
We have got to move to Los Angeles.
But I work here.
Oh, please.
You call Apple computers work?
What kind of company offers stock options as a Christmas bonus?
That ship is sinkin'.
Sweetie, remember when we were talkin' about trying cocaine?
Yeah I think we should start looking for some right now.
Because we're gonna be able to afford it.
Okay.
I mean, if you're sure.
I've never been more sure about anything in my entire life.
Pile of Bullets.
Pile of Bullets.
Oh, yes!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Something for the committee to put on their radar: Insurance.
- What about it?
- School needs some.
I can ask around on the street.
- What the hell?
- Oh, too cool - for street insurance?
- Must be nice.
My sister wants to know what I'm bringing to my grandson's birthday party.
I'm sensing an emergency collage situation.
No, I wasn't invited.
My son had a kid three years ago.
I barely get to see him on major holidays.
I mean, who in the hell does he think he is?
You saw your son at his wedding.
No, that's Furio.
That's my gay son.
Him I get.
Hank's a knob.
He doesn't have any hobbies or interests.
All he does is play that what do you call that crap with the dungeons and the dragons?
- Dungeons & dragons?
- That's the crap.
- Ooh.
- I know that game.
- We play Dungeons & Dragons.
- Mm-hmm.
Guys, let's play d&d to help hickey reconnect with his son!
- Huh?
- Was everyone's takeaway from last time that we can use d&d to reprogram brains?
Nobody feels that we almost caused a suicide?
We prevented one.
Fabulous Neil felt like a nobody, and thanks to us, he's still out there, doing this and that in the background.
A satisfying sequel is difficult to pull off.
Many geniuses have defeated themselves through hubris, making this a chance to prove that I'm better than all of them I'm in.
All in favor of a game of Dungeons & Dragons to reunite hickey and his son tomorrow night?
- Aye!
Well, okay.
It's short notice, but, uh, I think it'll be good for me.
So, dad, I'm just curious.
Um, what is it about Dungeons & Dragons that suddenly leapt out at you at age 60?
Um Dungeons.
It'd be the dungeons.
Let's begin.
A blood-orange sunrise crests the peaks of rage mountain, as the eight of you arrive at the troubled realm of Galindor.
Ahead to the north, a bridged ravine.
Beyond that, a mysterious black tower where, rumor has it, an evil necromancer dwells.
Your goal: Reach to the top of the tower and destroy the necromancer, freeing the realm from his evil magic.
Oh, that's just what I love about role-playing games, is being told exactly what to do.
Me too.
You should introduce yourselves.
I am oh, boy.
Joseph Gordon diehard.
Really.
Son of sir riggs diehard.
Well, I'm sir riggs diehard, so I guess I'm your dad in the game too.
- Oh, my God, so cool.
- Oh, it's nice.
- Isn't that weird?
- Oh, boy.
Guys, I don't suppose that this is some sort of contrived paint-by-numbers adventure that's designed to force an emotional bond between me and my emotionally stunted father, is it?
- No way, Jose.
- We wouldn't do that to you, man.
What?
I got an idea.
Why don't we just sort of reshuffle these - Oh.
- Oh, um and just redistribute them - No, I don't - And just mix 'em up a bit.
Is this right, Abed?
Should we and here we go.
Hello, everyone.
I am Tristram Steelheart.
I'm a holy cleric with a mace and a dumb name.
Ouch.
I'm tiny nuggins, a, uh, a thief, and the rest is gibberish.
Greetings, I am Fibrosis the Ranger.
I'm Crouton, the half-orc druid.
Druid?
Oh, Crouton.
Hector the well endowed?
Again?
You think that's a weird coincidence?
I'm a troll named Dingleberry.
That's my mom's nickname for me.
Well, I'm who hickey was, sir riggs diehard.
I am Joseph Gordon, son of riggs.
I protect the blade of diehard, a family sword whose power knows no equal.
In our clan, the leader carries the hilt, his eldest heir, the blade, for we believe man's greatest weapon against evil is the bond bet Is the bond between a father and son.
Aw.
What would you guys like to do?
We should cross the bridge and head for the black tower.
Huzzah?
Huzzah?
Huzzah.
- Huzzah.
- Yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna head across the bridge, actually.
I mean, what else is out there?
What's South or east or west?
How about it, Aziz?
If I walk too far South, do I fall off your graph paper there?
You can head South.
I've generated some details about the surrounding area.
You know, for God's sakes, Hank, it's been five seconds.
Can you not do this?
Hey, you tell me.
- Are we losing?
- No.
It's not a competition.
- The only winner is fun.
- Mmhmm.
We're having fun!
I go to Tristram, and I'm laughing, and I pick him up, and I carry him to the bridge.
It's fun!
Hector the well endowed is trying to lift you.
I cast Torvin's flesh of fire.
Tristram murmurs an incantation.
His body becomes wreathed in white-hot flame, burning Hector for Six damage.
- Hey!
- Well, Hector, that's called self-defense.
Tristram's flesh of fire spell has caught the bridge on fire.
The rope supports in the middle snap, causing the bridge to twist.
I'm rolling dexterity checks to see if you all hold on.
- Oh!
- Abed, considering the bigger picture, you think it might be possible you miscalculated the strength of the bridge, hmm?
Good point.
It would've been constructed in the third age by goblins, and they used primitive iron anchors.
The ropes are yanked from the rocky slopes on both sides, and you all plummet into the ravine below.
Abed!
- Oh!
- Abed!
You plunge into the icy, raging waters of skull river.
Ow!
You know, what's your problem?
- What's your problem?
- You didn't invite me to Sebastian's birthday.
Ah, ha, ha, I knew it!
Who hoards a man's grandson?
He's not your grandson.
He's my son.
And I didn't invite you to the birthday party 'cause I wanted to enjoy it.
You know, fathers and sons, there is a lot of power between them.
- Yeah - Stop it.
And I spent a long time letting that power push me away from my dad, and I regret it.
So what's ever between you guys will only get fixed when you're together.
- They're not together.
- Abed, you're not helping.
I'd be a pretty bad dungeon master if I was.
Jeff, hickey, Annie, and Shirley, you've been washed down the left fork of the skull river, the others to the right.
Father!
If you're going to continue, I need Hank, Britta, Chang, and Dean Pelton to go into a different room.
Yeah, we're not going to continue.
Thank you very much, guys.
This was just awesome.
Yeah, wait, wait, wait.
I'll play your dragon game with you.
But let's make it interesting.
If I kill the necrophile before you do, I come to my grandson's birthday.
We'll settle it like men.
Or whatever you call the guys that play this.
Okay.
But if I kill the necromancer before you do, then you don't go to Christmas or Thanksgiving at aunt Rachel's.
You don't even go to that.
Yeah, but I will if you don't.
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.
Let the real game begin.
I will find you!
Well, I'm assuming you guys can help me beat him, because if we lose, I'm gonna punch each of you in the heart.
You awaken on a muddy riverbank, surrounded by treacherous, God-forsaken, non-zipline vacation jungle.
I build a fire and construct a crude wooden rack to dry my boots and oversized codpiece.
All right, and I can make some s'mores out of horse meat and s'more horse meat.
Build a fire?
Horse s'mores?
Screw this.
The river runs east.
I head west.
Tiny Nuggins scampers into the jungle.
Hey, pal, I didn't scamper in the jungles of Nicaragua, and I'm not gonna do it now.
Wait, come back!
I follow him.
- Me too.
- Tiny Nuggins, if we rest, we'll regain our strength.
And lose my family.
I'll imaginary sleep when I'm imaginary dead.
Through the brush in the distance, you notice a patrol of half a dozen hobgoblins.
Hobgoblins?
Larger, stronger, and worth more in scrabble than regular goblins.
- Everybody, get down.
- I punch him in the heart.
- What?
- Well, I punch him in the heart, and I keep running.
There are no women with them, are there?
I got class.
You charge toward them, alerting them to your presence, and you attack the nearest one in the chest.
You miss and fall down.
What?
- Oh.
- The hobgoblins are heading toward Nuggins with Spears.
Oh, no!
Uh, I cast entangle on them.
Crouton the druid waves her arms, causing grass, vines, and branches to entangle the limbs of Four hobgoblins.
The two free hobgoblins fire arrows at Crouton.
One pierces her shoulder Oh!
- The other her chest.
- Ow!
I fire an arrow at them.
Hit.
Ah, these hobgoblins don't like their odds.
They bolt into the jungle.
- Yeah, you better run.
- Yes.
Go find a name that's not just another creature's name - plus "hob".
- Uhoh.
- Crouton?
- I'm here.
She was badly wounded from her fall in the skull river, and the arrows were just too much.
I'm sorry.
That's it?
Is she dead?
Yes, that's it, hickey.
I'm dead.
But it's okay.
I'm on your side.
Which is why I'm dead.
And I may be gone, but just remember whenever the wind whispers through the woods, you got me killed.
Now, you listen to me, young man.
I've punched about a thousand hearts in my life.
I never, never missed.
Have you ever been a 3-foot-tall halfling running through trying to punch a 7-foot monster?
I'm gonna go check on the others.
You might want to check your character.
Or just kind of generally take this game seriously.
Your son does.
I take a moment of silence to mourn my fallen comrade, Crouton Before rifling through her belongings.
What news of my father?
You have no way of knowing where the others are.
- Damn it.
- You're still traveling north along the narrow cliff edges of the hawthorne mountains.
Okay, I'll roll for any encounters.
I'd like to cast a healing spell on Fibrosis.
Oh.
Thank you.
But I-I'm not gonna help you kick your dad out of your life.
I don't think this competition is healthy, and I don't think what you did back there was cool.
Look, you think I'm the bad guy because I didn't invite him to my son's birthday.
But you know where he was for most of my birthdays?
Little place that rhymes with "not there".
Times Square?
The four of you hear an ominous screeching.
Moving upward into view, three huge, white arachnids with eagle wings.
Sky spiders.
I draw my sword And I cry out, "back, eight-legged demons!
"I will not scoop you up with a catalogue and let you outside on this day"!
Stay your blade, Joseph Gordon.
Sky spiders are as frightened of us as we are of them.
Plus they eat all the sky mosquitoes.
- Mm.
- I cast speak with monsters, and I say, "hello.
You're looking well".
The lead spider bends four knees and twitches its hairy ovipositor, rhythmically secreting and retracting a giant droplet or drop of silk.
- Oh.
- Fibrosis, as a Ranger, you recognize this as the arachnid's signal of submission.
Oh.
Nice work, Tristram.
Damn, you made that sky spider your bitch, yo!
You've tracked the hobgoblins to this shack.
One guard hob-guards the door.
That's what they call guarding.
- Go.
- Sniper arrow on the guard.
It strikes true.
The guard drops.
I move to the doorway.
Detect traps.
- None detected.
- I enter.
- Left flank.
- Right!
One hobgoblin, facing east.
- Backstab.
- Double damage.
Critical hit.
He's dead.
Footsteps behind the door to the north.
I notch two arrows.
I climb the walls to get above the door.
Five goblins enter from the north.
- I fire.
- Both arrows hit.
- Cleave!
- You kill one and wound another.
I drop on the last one and grapple.
- You got ahold of him.
- This one is for Crouton.
With his dying breath, he utters "The dark lord will kill you all".
Wait, these things can talk?
I want two taken alive.
I want to try something.
Hi.
I'm tiny Nuggins.
I'm gonna put my dagger down right here, so we can just talk.
Human trash.
Yeah, look, I'm gonna give it to you straight.
We're looking for a necromancer.
We don't need two goblins to find him.
So between you and your friend, who do you think's the most useful?
Man, your friend sure can talk.
- Liar.
He'll never turn.
- Oh, yeah, because of that famous goblin loyalty.
I could never drive a wedge between you and some guy from work.
Uh, I was best man at that guy's wedding.
Oh?
Your friend says you just got married.
Congratulations.
Too bad about the food.
I hope your flesh rots in wait.
What about the food?
Oh, I guess he didn't like your wedding toast.
Golbak said that?
Klang doesn't approve of you and Lisa, Golbak, and I don't get the sense it's because of his feelings for you.
You know, I think about Lisa, sitting in that hole in Darktooth canyon with little Framrok and Griknog rolling about on the wolf pelts.
Come on, between you and me, which one do you think is yours?
No!
I know where the tower is.
The sky spiders have flown you as far as their complex religion allows.
They set you down and express through intricate prancing directions to the tower.
Yes.
Father, forgive me.
I have traveled so far from you.
How many game days since the skull river ripped us apart?
How many real hours since I've gone pee?
We seek this necromancer.
Why?
Why?
Our reasons are dreams, our dreams, dust.
I send word on wings of sparrows, in hopes they might find you.
Abed says the odds are near impossible.
That's enough for me.
Should you receive this message, I know of a way to reunite.
According to my character sheet, if I rub the blade of our magic family sword while you rub the hilt, twin beacons of light will reveal our locations to each other.
Each night, I will think of you and rub, praying for the night fate will find us rubbing together.
Your son, Joseph Gordon diehard.
Something strange has happened.
A sparrow lands on riggs diehard's shoulder.
It carries a note.
Abed, I Rub my sword's hilt?
A beam of light shoots out from your location, as the hilt of diehard seeks its blade.
The beam arcs and meets an equal beam in the woods to the north.
Is that where the others are?
Yes, 10 Miles away, same as you.
So we'll be arriving at the tower At the same time tomorrow morning.
This began as a race.
But it may end in war.
Does anybody have a toothpick?
I got a piece of popcorn stuck in my tooth.
You know, it's, like, right under the gum, and, you know, I've been trying, like, for 15 minutes with, you know, my tooth and, like, with my tongue and with my finger, and I'm always one tooth off, and I just can't seem to oh, hello, there we go.
Anyway.
But it may end in war.
Maybe after all we've been through, we should just call this thing off.
What, you think that's up to us?
You've seen the way he talks to me.
He doesn't want his own father in his life.
He'll do anything to win, and that includes attacking you.
And you best believe that your little friends in there are drinking up his kool-aid.
This is a man who thinks of grandchildren like trophies.
Which is why he'll play to win.
And why I can't let him.
Rise, brave, sweet Dingleberry.
Rise.
Both parties have arrived at the black tower.
Hi, guys.
- Father.
- Joseph Gordon.
Mm-mm.
We are here, so Tristram Steelheart, lord of the sky spiders, can slay the necromancer.
You guys cool, or are we gonna have to get red?
Tiny Nuggins, waterboarder of goblins, will do the slaying, because every man has the right to hang out with his grandson.
Too bad you're outnumbered.
No, they're not.
I'm not part of this.
I'm Joseph Gordon diehard, and I am only here to hug my father, which I now do.
It's a trick.
I'm not letting him hug me.
I hug my father.
He has gunpowder in his pants.
I draw my sword.
Stay back!
- I draw an arrow.
- So do I. - Troll sound!
- Jeff, do you lower your sword?
- No!
- Dean, are you - I hug my father!
- You're impaled.
Oh!
Worth it.
Ugh.
Good lord.
Son slayer!
- I attack Jeff!
- Arrow at Chang!
- Arrow at Annie!
- I head for the door of the tower.
So do I!
Taste the blade of diehard!
- I run for cover.
- I turn a snake into a rope.
- Fire two arrows at Annie.
- Spear, spear.
- I take the kid.
I pop him.
- Three damage.
Lightning bolt, lightning bolt, lightning bolt.
Cure moderate wounds!
I spray all over them.
I hold Britta's face in a puddle.
- Seven damage.
- Cleave, cleave, cleave!
I fire two arrows.
Dingleberry smash!
Plus three, demonic eye look.
And shove it up them!
After that, I put one right behind the ear.
Sir riggs, hand in your character sheet.
Top floor of the tower, one door.
I open it.
I cast flame strike on him.
- You cast that already.
- Mace.
- Okay.
Missed.
- Ah.
I hit him with a throwing dagger.
- You used all your knives.
- Ah, what will one of you guys take care what?
You're all dead?
I keep going.
- I follow.
- You've reached the necromancer's workshop.
You see his bed, some bottles of goop, some other necromancing crap, but no necromancer.
I search.
I search.
Can I search, or are you gonna stab me in the back?
Hey, I am a thief, not a wuss.
I search too.
Mm-hmm.
You find a secret door.
It's easy because it's already open.
It leads to a ladder, which goes straight down to another open door on the back of the tower.
Ah, man.
Way to go.
That's great.
He just got away.
Hey, you can't just say he's gone.
You owe us an ending.
I owe you nothing.
I am a dungeon master.
I create a boundless world, and I bind it by rules.
Too heavy for a bridge?
It breaks.
Get hit?
Take damage.
Spend an hour outside someone's front door, fighting over who gets to kill him?
He leaves through the back.
He's out there somewhere.
You might find him, if you get your crap together.
Hey, guys.
Take it from a bunch of ghosts.
This is no kind of life.
You need fresh air and frozen yogurt.
It's on me.
Hug it out.
- Oh, see - Hug it out?
- Gag me.
- Who even uses that phrase?
- Are you out of your mind?
- All right, I'm climbing down the ladder.
I'm gonna find this guy.
I stay and search the workshop.
Does he have any stuff there that can heal me?
- You do find some potions.
- Okay, well, I-I get half of that.
Excuse me, you just went down the ladder.
Well, I can hear you can I hear him looting upstairs?
Not if I move about silently.
Fine.
Fine.
If I heal you, can we divide the potions?
Okay.
But I decide who gets what.
All right, fine, but we've gotta be wary of traps.
I don't have to do a damn thing that you tell me to do.
- What's going on?
- Shh.
- You outta your mind?
- Do you wanna get - Oh, you give me a break.
- The necromancer or not?
- I'm so up to here with you.
- Do you want Do they like each other now?
Are you kidding me?
They can't stand being in the same room.
I also don't think they can handle being apart.
And I think they just found a way to avoid doing either.
And that's the best most fathers and sons can do.
You've made me so proud today.
Ugh.
Does anyone know where we can buy a real sword?
Oh, Jeffrey.
You're still at the entrance to the chamber of grief.
Your move, Mr. Tickles.
You successfully pour more tea into Count Frogula's cup.
That puts it at Hillary Rodham Kitten.
Okay, you attempt to pass crumpets.
You fail.
Okay, guys, I'm getting a little frustrated.
If you'd just take a look at your inventories, you'll see that Abed, are you almost done?
I can't sleep without my stuffies.
Fine.
Hold on.
Oh, a goblin notices you and murders you all.
You're dead.
They're all yours.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Cobra, Cobra, Cobra, Cobra, Cobra, Cobra, Cobra, Cobra, Cobra, Cobra, Cobra, Cobra, Cobra.
Cobra!
Destroy the Taj Mahal.
Cobra!
Not if G.I. Joe can help it.
Roadblock, deep six.
Hold off those hiss tanks.
- Yo, Joe!
- Hat Muffs, Pit Take, shoot down those rattlers.
Um, excuse me, sir.
Why is Cobra attacking a tourist attraction with zero tactical value, and with all due respect to India, why are we defending it?
Tightship, you can overhaul G.I. Joe when you're commander.
Which will clearly happen any day now, as long as your  stay on full display.
Whoa, Buzzkill, language.
No, you can't have ice cream for lunch.
Put your brother on the phone.
Three Kids, put down that phone.
We're in the middle of a battle.
Oh, screw you, Flint.
I'm in a battle called having three kids.
Guys, we're a squad.
You're making me look bad.
Well, if you're so great, Wingman, show us how it's done.
With pleasure.
We'll meet again, G.I. Joe.
Good shooting, Wingman, but it looks like Destro's getting away.
Not necessarily, sir.
Jeez!
What?
Oh, no.
What are you doing?
Hey!
Are you crazy?
Wha uh Yo, Joe!
What?
What, we're we're not saying it together?
Yo, Joe!
He'll fight for freedom, wherever there's trouble G.I. Joe is there G.I. Joe, American hero G.I. Joe is there it's G.I. Joe against Cobra the enemy fighting to save the day he never gives up, he's always there fighting for freedom over land and air G.I. Joe, a real American hero G.I. Joe is there G.I. Joe is the code name for America's daring, awesomely trained, awesome mission force.
Its purpose to fight Cobra, because they're terrorists.
Look, I think I'm over-explaining it.
The bad guys are snakes, and the good guys are army people.
He never gives up he'll stay till the fight's won G.I. Joe will dare G.I. Joe, a real American hero G.I. Joe Wingman, Three Kids, Buzzkill, Tightship, you stand accused of violence, suggestive language, and mature situations unbecoming of G.I. Joe.
What say you?
Look, I understand this is the first time a G.I. Joe has killed anyone in all of recorded history.
- However - However, let's be truthful.
This is a very disorganized militia.
Yeah, what's anyone's rank?
We're all just dressed like serial killers and strippers.
I have three kids.
You guys are not helping.
Duke, Flint, Scarlett, yes, it's true I killed Destro.
And I promise not to do it again.
But is it really a crime?
Is Cobra not a ruthless terrorist organization determined to rule the world?
And if we never kill them, are we not basically on their side?
And won't this war therefore last forever unless we finish killing Cobra or start killing ourselves?
How long are we in here, Cold Shoulder?
Cold Shoulder?
What's with that guy?
"Start killing Cobra or killing ourselves"?
We were in the fourth down.
It was a hail mary.
This place is a graveyard for G.I. Joe rejects.
Look who's in here Deep Dish, Shark Arms, Weird Head, Home Free, Place Holder, Sleep Apnea, and us!
I have three kids.
This is the worst day of my life.
Is it life?
My name is Fourth Wall.
And I believe that what we perceive as life is actually a syndicated children's cartoon.
What?
Shut up, Fourth Wall.
If this were a cartoon, there'd be a word for "cartoon" in our language, which there isn't.
There'd also be less movement, less detail, and constant lip-sync mistakes.
What if I told you there was more, a higher reality, with more than 65 colors and at least three dimensions?
Then I guess someone would have to lock you up with the crazy people.
Oh, good.
I recently infiltrated a secret Cobra dig site, code name: Greendale.
What did you say?
Cobra has discovered an ancient buried structure filled with strange things.
Look.
- Oh, yeah, look at that.
- It's a child's toy.
The toy was more real than this at Greendale.
Ow, oof.
What is that word?
Greendale?
Cobra's out to take over the world, but G.I. Joe is there.
G.I. Joe must be destroyed.
Cobra hiss coming for attack!
It's the new G.I. Joe submachopter, piloted by Wingman.
- Retreat!
- Yo, Joe!
We are in a toy commercial!
I can't hear you when you're covered in rocks.
It doesn't hurt because it isn't real.
- Good job, Wingman.
- Thank you, Duke.
G.I. Joe is my entire life.
Yo, Joe!
All other figures and vehicles sold separately.
- Wingman, what happened?
- I don't know.
He clearly has a connection to the non-cartoon reality.
When I mentioned Greenda Shut up.
Stop saying that word.
You're some kind of demon man, and and your outfit is three layers of racist.
Oh, my God, he's having an attack.
Jeff, can you hear us?
It's Annie.
What did you just call me?
Jeffrey, do you know where you are?
Be quiet.
Leave me alone.
I I don't belong here.
I belong in G.I. Joe.
Ow!
And don't touch me.
Who wears a saw on their arm?
The first time I met Destro, he asked me if he should have his entire head coated in chrome.
I said, "no.
How would you do that"?
How would that even work?
Look, I'm not good at eulogies because I've never had to give one.
All I want to know is, how did G.I. Joe do this?
We've been shooting at each other and missing for 20 years.
Now all of a sudden Unbelievable.
What?
Cobra Commander, it's Vice Cobra Assistant Commander.
We just got a very interesting energy surge at the Greendale site.
Oh, okay.
That's super fascinating.
Um, Destro's dead!
Oh, my gosh, Destro?
Were you guys close?
Were we close?
Yes!
What kind of a question is Okay, fine.
I loved him!
Is that what you want to hear?
Called it.
And we are going to find out how this happened, and G.I. Joe is going to pay-bra!
I riffed that.
No wrong answers.
It's a condition that comes on when you get to a certain weight.
Oh, I see.
So is there a Mr. Tightship, or Um That's a code three.
Cobra forces are infiltrating the base.
Cobra!
Avenge my totally platonic friend!
Oh, great, and we're stuck in here.
We don't have to be.
For 15 years, I have used my trademark tablespoon to excavate a tunnel, swallowing handfuls of dirt and rock with my meals and listening only to Smashmouth in order to justify this poster.
Now I am within inches of reaching the Come on, if we help save the base, maybe they'll let us be G.I. Joes again.
Battle stations!
Snakes at 6:00.
Okay, now remember don't kill anybody.
Just lay down a suppressive fire, like this.
Oh, my gosh!
I'm sorry.
Oh, God.
Oh, man.
Oh, darn it.
Yeah, I'd say they're suppressed.
Jeez.
Aw, was that lifeline?
Sorry!
Someone's killing people.
It's Wingman!
He's escaped!
Lay down a suppressive fire!
They're suppressive firing at us!
I think we'll be okay.
Remember, this is all just a cartoon about action figures for kids.
Shut up, Fourth Wall, and get into the new G.I. Joe submachopter with twin rocket launchers and rotating attack jet.
All I want to do is be a good G.I. Joe.
What's wrong with me?
I'm not sure, but I think our answers will be at Greendale.
Ugh.
Whoops.
Shouldn't somebody be flying the plane?
- It's submachopter.
- Whatever.
Will somebody grab the stick?
I don't wanna die up here!
Oh, Lord!
The G.I. Joe mutineers are even worse than Cobra because they're traitors.
- Buzzkill - All government is a lie.
Tightship I control everything, or else!
- Three Kids - My family comes first.
Fourth Wall Doesn't this guy also do the voice for He-man commercials?
And their nefarious, ruthless leader, Wingman.
Hey, that's not true!
I love G.I. Joe!
I don't know, man.
Seems like you hate it.
This is all a misunderstanding.
Tell it to the judge.
Everything is sold separately.
Assembly required.
Nothing is happening.
Cartoon coffee?
Tightship is piloting the submachopter.
At first it was Buzzkill, but she almost crashed five times, and when we pointed it out, she called us sexist and went to the bathroom.
You know she's smoking in there, right?
She broke the detector.
That's a federal crime.
I keep having these visions.
Kids, little boys Uh, are these visions we should share with the authorities?
I want to go to this Greendale place now.
We're on our way.
Do you remember Greendale, Jeffrey?
Why did you call me that?
What's with you people?
What do you mean, "you people"?
- Oh!
- Nice.
That's the entrance to the excavation site.
How do we get past those guards?
I think I got an idea.
Your idea was doing exactly what we did to those other guards back at headquarters?
It was proven effective.
I don't know, seems kind of cheap.
From an animated perspective, very cheap.
Help me club this hatch open.
I know this place.
It's filling me with a sense of endless hours for unfair wages and printers that never have toner.
What is this, Major Dick?
That is a request for hazard pay.
Maybe you haven't heard, but we can actually die now.
You know we can't afford this.
Oh, so we can afford to create a new model of weaponized vehicle once a week, but we basically get minimum wage to risk our lives.
Well, welcome to Cobra, Ximxam.
Maybe you noticed our logo was a snake?
Suck it up, guys!
And while I have your attention, here.
What is this?
We have to lower the salaries.
Our insurance is going up.
- No way.
- What?
Hey, you people can actually die now.
It affects the health plan.
Vice Cobra Assistant Commander, we've been infiltrated by Joes!
Well?
Protect me!
Hello, Greendale.
I understand G.I. Joe has breached the perimeter.
Please eliminate them.
And please don't forget this Saturday is the Cobra fun run.
If you miss it, you're letting the anti-terrorists win.
Ugh, overkill.
Yes, it's me.
But which me is the real me?
Probably the one in the middle.
The middle, right?
Aah!
Ow, my leg!
Ow!
Now, before you fight me, G.I. Joe, you should be warned.
I, Ximxam, have a twin brother named Mixmax that feels all my pain.
And how is that supposed to affect us?
Psychologically?
Aah!
Today's soup is a carrot purÃ©e with a ow!
Damn it!
Aah!
Sorry.
My twin brother is a it's pointless to explain.
- Hurts so much!
- Right?
It shredded my meniscus!
Whup!
Whup!
Whup!
Oh!
Ow, ooh, ooh.
Shouldn't have done that.
Ooh.
Nope.
Don't like that sound.
Incredible.
It's as if there's something about this place that feeds on ambition.
I came from here.
I work here.
My name is Jeff Winger.
And you're Annie.
And and Shirley.
And Abed and Britta.
Britta?
What kind of lame name is that?
I wanna be Buzzkill because of my awesome saw.
You guys are my friends in real life.
This is my imagination or something.
Freeze, everybody!
Don't make me zap you!
Craig, it's me, Jeff.
Jeffrey!
Are you okay?
No, he's not.
Take it from an expert in delusion.
If Jeff's hallucinating something this cool, something's wrong, he needs to get back.
Wingman, do you have your wingpack, - or is it sold separately?
- Here it is.
That's good, my Fourth Wall penetrating powers combined with this medium's lack of internal logic should allow me to come up with an oversimplified solution.
I'll be right back.
I have to get something.
- What?
- The truth.
Oh, crap.
Ah, Jeff, while you were gone, I figured everything out and did everything that needs to be done.
This may be your delusion, but I'm still the one on the ball.
I know why I'm here.
I'm unconscious.
Jeff Winger's unconscious, because he I drank a fifth of scotch.
And I took some pills.
Jeffrey, shame on you.
I have three kids.
Are you saying you tried to No, they were these stupid youth pills that I bought in Koreatown.
I took them because it's my birthday and - I've been lying about my age.
- Whoa.
Yeah, it's not something I'm really ready to deal with.
I guess you found a way to deal with it unconsciously through a psychotic break.
Happens to the best of us.
Now, these are the three layers of reality.
We are in the cartoon layer.
It's separated from the live-action layer by a dangerous mid-layer called children's toy commercials, which I believe you're seeing in your visions.
I've modified your wingpack to break this barrier, and - I'm not going back.
- Jeff, you have to go back.
I don't wanna be a middle-aged community college teacher.
I wanna be in G.I. Joe.
I wanna fight for freedom wherever there's trouble forever.
Jeff, that's your ten-year-old self talking.
You've receded into some infantile part of your mind.
Imaginary Britta is right.
And only imaginary Britta.
In these visions you're having, a giant child is controlling you.
You have to get away from him.
I am him!
That's the point.
I created this.
I chose this.
But do you understand that the real Jeff Winger is in some kind of actual, real medical jeopardy?
Like the kind in a one-hour drama?
Jeff, please.
I don't want you to die.
Can you hear me?
I'm only dying out there, Annie.
In here we're immortal.
Look at the rack I gave you.
Those are gonna stay right where they are for an eternity.
You're welcome.
Yo, Jobra!
"Yo, Jobra"?
We talked it over and realized that since none of us can kill each other, we might as well team up.
Seeing as we've got a common enemy.
Seize them!
You can't seize me.
I am the creator of your reality.
I am Neo in the third act of the Matrix.
I'm also Neo in the first act of the second Matrix.
I didn't get around to seeing the third one, but my guess is oh!
Cobra and G.I. Joe have finally united.
Do you guys need anything?
We could probably use some milk.
Let's go get some milk for G.I. Joe.
I'll wait it out in this cell until you guys can reeducate me.
Yo, Jobra!
Yo, Jobra.
All figures come with their own accessories.
Wingman sold separately or something.
Ah, look who'ssssss conscious again.
You're pretty selective with those snake "S" s. What are you, my life coach?
I'd make fun of some physical detail about you, but there aren't any.
You look like some Aryan foosball figure.
Guys, you don't have to keep me prisoner.
I want what you want.
We can't just have you running around, Wingman.
You're too powerful.
So let's share the power.
We can be gods here forever.
For realsies?
Absolutely.
I don't wanna leave here.
I wanna hang out with you guys and blow stuff up.
Hmm.
All right.
- Yo, Jobra.
- Yo, Jobra.
Yo, Jobra.
Say, do you mind if we ask you a few questions about real life?
No problem.
- Ask.
- So What do boobies look like?
Wait.
You don't know?
You guys have never seen a naked woman?
You don't have to make us feel bad.
Have you guys ever tasted scotch?
Does scotch liquor exist here?
You know what?
Can I just go to the bathroom real quick?
Sure.
It's the second door over there on the right.
Hey!
We can't go to the bathroom!
Fool!
He's getting away!
This had better work.
No, no, no, wait!
Get off me!
I wanna go home!
Take me with you!
I want to see women's boobs!
We can't both go!
You're slowing me down!
Let go!
I can feel it!
Yes!
I can feel reality!
I've never felt so alive!
Because you're fictional!
You can't survive this!
Wait, why does my back hurt?
Why do I just have random pains in my body?
Why is my ability to appreciate new music diminishing?
Need to gain speed before Wingman is trying to escape G.I. Joe, and it's up to you to hold him back with your inner child's hand.
Damn it, I didn't make it.
I'm not controlling him!
He's doing this himself!
Screw you, kid!
Ow!
He burnt my hand.
The Wingman wingpack is not available in stores.
You control the toy.
You control it, my ass.
- What is it doing?
- Making a man of you.
Everything sold separately.
Everyone dies eventually.
Nobody gets out alive.
His eyes are opening.
Yeah, but that happens when people die too.
- Jeff!
Jeffrey!
- Wait, Britta, don't slap him!
Jeffrey, it's me, the Dean.
I'm right here.
Wait, wait, no, no, I think you have to Oh, stop it, I'm awake.
Oh!
Jeff, you've been keeping your birthday a secret?
Yeah.
Most people have cake.
Not a fifth of scotch and what the hell else.
"Age reverse, life extend power"?
This is Korean.
- Okay, what am I?
- Chinese!
Okay, I swear to God I feel Korean.
Guys I'm 40.
What?
- Wow.
- I'm so sorry.
Yeah, we knew that.
You know, I guess we knew that you had to be around 30 when we met.
Yeah, and it has been five years.
And even if he had been 32, we'd have to know he would be - This isn't helping.
- You guys know I'm 38, right?
What?
I'm kidding.
But, Jeff, you shouldn't almost die over a number.
What's important are ranges of numbers.
You're still 18 to 49 for almost a decade.
That's valuable to society.
You have any more of these pills left?
I had the craziest dream.
It was all animated and a G.I. Joe cartoon, and you were all in it.
In it?
How much?
What clothes did you draw me in?
Mm, fully animated?
But it was all a dream because you were unconscious.
Remember that Christmas when I Yes!
Jeff, here's your present.
Slim Pickings at the hospital gift shop, but we made do.
"It's a old boy".
- Yes.
- He is a old boy.
He's a old boy.
Bring it in, guys.
Jeff!
Hey, listen, I got a former partner that's been here since '89 in a coma, so hmm.
Winger, you're funny.
- This is cool!
- Make my name too.
- What are you guys, cavemen?
- Buzzkill!
What you're doing is a waste of spray paint.
We live in a fascist police state disguised as democracy.
You think you're gonna shatter that illusion by celebrating your own meaningless identities?
- Is church over yet?
- Fourth Wall!
A good syndicated cartoon has a lesson at the end.
But getting heavy-handed or preachy could turn an entire generation into jaded, sarcastic babies.
- Be friendly and direct.
- And keep the message simple.
Graffiti is bad.
Go play sports.
- Cool!
- I get it!
I was trying to hold them to a higher standard.
If the media tells kids what to think, all they'll know is And knowing is half the battle.
What?
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
So according to the demonologist, the gymnasium is clean.
Jeez, we're running out of To-Do Stars.
- Already dealt with.
- It's hard to believe.
Somewhere along the way, we started turning this school around.
Huh.
- Hmm.
- Huh.
- What the hell was that?
- What was what?
That long, quiet lull.
I don't like it.
It's called contentment, dude.
Exactly.
We're never content.
Someone's always got to have a problem.
I've got a problem.
I don't like Abed's problem with our lack of problems.
- Ooh.
- Oh.
Ah, okay.
I commented on his commentary.
I just drew a circle around Abed, baby.
I don't think it's nice to pigeonhole people's gimmicks.
You hear me, two voice?
Abed, let us have a moment of peace and stillness.
They're kind of rare around here.
All I'm saying is, calm before the storm.
Says the storm generator.
All right, fine.
Let's be content.
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
Attention, students and faculty of Greendale.
I pressed this button on accident but might as well check in.
How are you?
Fine.
Aw, that's nice.
I'm good too.
I love you guys.
We love you too.
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said it can be here We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one, they all just fade away The information you have requested is on the internet.
Oh.
School board, baby.
School board guys coming in.
I would appreciate some knocking.
Do you know what goes on in here?
Just a heads-up.
There's an insurance appraiser coming tomorrow.
Your ass is getting appraised insurance-style.
What does that mean?
We hope it means we find out that your school is very, very valuable to the city.
Hey, how hilarious would that be?
Are you guys drunk?
Good luck proving it before we're not.
Yeah.
Pa-pa-papaya.
Whoa!
Heh.
Strawberry.
Too ripe.
You guys have been doing this for 30 minutes.
So what?
I made all the vegetables disappear.
Usually, a lot more than this happens in 30 minutes is all I'm saying.
We're just relaxed and happy.
I care more about this than anything I've ever cared about.
Best $199 I've ever spent.
It's $3.
What are you playing?
That's control software for some kind of irrigation equipment.
It's fun.
Save Greendale Committee, unite.
Boom.
An insurance appraiser is coming tomorrow to inspect the school, and if he doesn't appraise us good, the school is doomed, doomed.
Call to adventure.
Call to adventure.
What's an insurance appraiser?
Something that sounds normal and boring but is actually scary, like a raised mole or a turkey deep fryer.
There's only one man qualified to appraise insurance, and he died 2,000 years ago on a cross.
I've seen insurance appraisers bleed.
Their blood's different, darker.
Everyone, take a breath.
You're overreacting because this school is addicted to crisis.
They're like one of those hurricane Katrina dogs that won't let anyone pet them anymore.
But the weird thing we need to get used to is this: The school's in decent shape.
This doesn't have to be a big deal.
I wrote a paper on those dogs.
We've worked hard all semester to save this school.
Truth is, we did.
So relax.
- Are you sure, Jeffrey?
- I promise.
Jeff's heart is in the right place, but he's wrong.
Greendale is a crazy place where crazy things happen.
I have a plan.
We'll pretend our school has a world-renowned physics department.
Dean, start learning Swedish.
I'll do my best!
Hickey, do you keep in touch with any unstable criminals that you busted?
Mm, five.
Get them down here for costume measurements.
Annie, we need to make a particle accelerator out of Kleenex boxes.
Nope.
Nobody do any of that.
Abed, outside.
There is no story.
Everything's a story, Jeff.
Getting out of bed is a story.
Certainly this is a story.
I mean, start with the study room.
We're content.
I'm concerned.
Skip the fruit-matching stuff.
Dean enters with the insurance appraiser story, call, refusal.
You're literally dragging me across a threshold demanding there be no story, which puts me into a whole new world that I'm gonna have to adapt to.
Well, you have to do it by yourself, please.
Okay?
Because if this appraisal is a story, that means we're in trouble, and we are not in trouble, because if we are No more stories.
Ta-da.
So we'll see you later.
After no story.
No story.
So be it.
Let the lack of story Hey.
Oh, put one trap behind each cabinet.
Although I think we're good.
The cafeteria food killed most of the roaches anyway.
Hey, check it out.
Is this a wedding ring?
Are you kidding?
What Aww, I lost this my first week here.
Oh, who's the lucky It's my mom's.
I started wearing it because I don't know.
Everybody dreams of settling down, right?
And because it fits.
She had huge fingers for a woman, part of what killed her, really.
I'm not dreaming about settling down.
Well, maybe you already have.
You're teaching, and you like it.
You love Greendale.
No, I love scotch and myself.
I tolerate Greendale.
It's a good school.
That's why there's no need for this to get sentimental.
This inspection is going to be the most boring thing to happen here since Britta dated Troy.
All right, no story.
Wait.
If there's no story, what am I explaining?
I'm in a story.
Okay, think, Abed, think.
How do you shake a story?
The answer is in the teacher's lounge.
- Here he comes, here he comes.
- Okay.
Hi, there.
My name is Ronald Mohammed.
Go ahead.
I've heard them all.
The city of Greendale has sent me here to assess this campus' level of liability.
Now, what do I mean by liability?
Well, the city defines liability as any asserted or non-asserted perturbation by any qualifying party.
What's a party?
A party is a person or a group of persons or an event celebrating a person or a party of persons' birth, marriage Don't panic, Jeffrey.
Hmm?
I'm fine.
I'm the only one who's not panicking.
Oh, please.
You can lie to yourself, but don't lie to me.
But the city defines a dog as any living entity with four legs and a tail, so raccoons, bears, mountain lions, mice these are all just different sizes of dog.
What do I mean by "size"?
I'll tell you a story.
What's that supposed to mean?
I know how much you feel for the campus, Jeff.
I know how much you feel in general.
And I know you think it's a weakness, but believe me, it's your strength.
You got something in your teeth.
Mm-hmm, you got something in your chest.
of liquefied horse meat.
Here I come.
Just "And you shall find that salt is the taste "of another man's bread, and hard is the way up and down another man's stairs".
Dante.
Let's proceed.
No!
It's always a story.
Everything is a story.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Story feeds on conflict.
If I stop resisting, it'll stop being a story.
No, Abed.
Me with a beard?
Keep fighting the story.
Keep fighting it until it falls apart.
I'm right.
I mean I'm wrong.
I mean I'm right.
I mean I'm wrong.
I mean I'm right.
I mean I'm wrong.
I mean I'm right.
I mean I'm wrong.
Unsubscribe.
For the final stage of my appraisal, I am going to randomly select one of your vending machines to see if it can be rocked using human strength enough to tip and crush me.
Now, in the U.S., each year, six people die this way, and five of them are insurance appraisers, so I take this very seriously.
Here we go.
Okay.
- Whoo!
- Sorry we're late.
Hey, look.
It's Ronald Mohammed.
How about that name?
All right, Ronald, what's the damage?
How much is this scampy, little hole in the Earth gonna cost us this year?
Well, your gas leak is repaired, all your fire exits actually lead outside, and I am told that no new species have been discovered here in a week.
I have to say, I was brought in here to estimate Greendale's liability, but at this point in time, I'd describe this campus as an actual property asset.
This property has value.
- Yeah!
- Best news ever!
- This property has value.
- It has value.
- That means we can sell it!
- We can finally sell it!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Press "stop" on Dave Matthews.
What did you just say?
We can start courting businesses to unload this school on the private sector.
What do you mean "unload it"?
This is a huge chunk of real estate, which generates no tax revenue and takes money from the education budget.
That's because it's a community college.
Well, excuse us for taking longer to see that was the problem.
Maybe we're not as smart as you.
I mean, we only went to Yale.
Oh, no, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
- Oh!
Oh, hey, we should call T.J.Maxx right away.
Dude, I told you.
This jacket looks fine.
No, to talk about selling this place.
Oh, right.
Yeah, T.J.Maxx, Marshalls.
What about Ben & Jerry's?
Oh, Richie, you're my friend, but that is the last thing you need.
Tough love received, bro.
I did it.
This school is story-free.
We can be content now forever.
Ahh!
Let me be one of the six this year.
Craig Craig, this vending machine is not gonna tip over and crush you.
Why not?
Why?
Because we fixed it when we saved Greendale.
We saved Greendale.
And now they're gonna sell it.
He wakes up in the morning If I come over there, there are gonna be two sounds: me hitting you twice.
Never changes a Hello, Greendale, as you know, our school will soon be replaced by a sandwich university.
However, every ending is also a beginning.
Sure, things may look bad now.
Some of us may have no idea where we're going or what to do.
But Okay, okay, I should have written this out.
I thought I'd be able to come up with something on the fly.
Moving on to phase two: the actual saving of Greendale.
Annie I've generated a few ideas involving social media that I think might do the trick.
Annie You want us to tweet "SaveGreendale"?
I'm sorry, Annie.
The reason I have 48 followers is that I don't exploit them.
They come to me for atheistic rants and photos of my meals, not this obnoxiousness.
We need to make people aware that Greendale exists - and needs help.
- Why?
Because once the internet knows about something, it changes.
Right.
Just ask Chris brown or China.
Jeff, you made Annie cry.
Well, if it's any consolation, this is the last time that will ever happen.
I know how to save Greendale.
Treasure.
Buried treasure.
Okay, I'm tapped.
We all wish we could do something, Annie, but I think that concludes the last meeting of the Save Greendale Committee, the committee that did its darnedest.
Wait.
Are we sure we can't stop the school from being sold to Subway?
I'm afraid so, Chang.
Okay, I just wanted to make sure.
Ha-ha, screw you guys.
It's time to get paid.
$5 $5 footlong Any, any, any, 5 $5 footlong Any, any, any, 5 Chang just unexpectedly betrayed the group for the last time.
Greendale is going to make a great Subway sandwich university.
You know, research shows most of your graduates end up working for our restaurants anyway.
That's by design.
We're very proud of our school.
Proud of Subway's school.
This campus is yours now.
If you want to dynamite it, all we ask is that you let us light the fuse.
Yeah, we hate this place.
You just said you were proud of it.
- Oh, proud of its potential.
- Love its potential.
This will be your office.
Why?
Okay, we'll check in on that later.
What's the matter, guys?
Can't wait until Greendale's corpse is cold before you put it on a 6-inch white bun?
Young lady, that's not fair.
Subway doesn't call its bread "buns," and we don't serve white.
We serve Italian, honey oat, nine-grain wheat.
Great, thanks for making my joke accurate.
Now it's hilarious.
Classes are over, kids.
We're helping the Dean pack.
This is still Greendale for two hours.
Enjoy it.
Wait.
You don't call your bread "buns".
What do you call them?
Bread.
Well, bread is a substance.
What do you call the units of bread you use, "breads"?
- You okay?
- I just wish we had more time.
I could turn things around.
I swear.
Look, I got one of these label things.
It makes custom labels.
This was gonna help me get organized.
Aw.
Where should we start?
Should we pack up these pictures?
They're not really mine.
They're Greendale history.
Here's our 1987 civil rights march.
This was when we started offering Photoshop classes.
And that's Russell Borchert.
"Borchert, Borchert, loved computers" Yes, yes, "more than women's butts or hooters".
Very mature, you two.
Was there any truth to that legend?
The legend that a Greendale computer professor made love to a computer and died of the first computer virus?
Sure.
The truth is, Greendale had a computer professor.
By the way, he was a millionaire and a genius.
He has sex with one computer, and that's his legacy?
So after all my work, how will I be remembered?
The bald Dean with glasses, I guess.
Are you aware there's an engraved plate on this frame that says "the truth is behind this picture"?
Of course I'm aware, Abed.
I'm not an idiot.
Whoa, wait.
It meant literally?
What is it?
I understand you were teaching Fundamentals of Law here.
Yeah.
Think you could make the transition to teaching Sandwich Law?
It's essentially the same, I'm sure, just a bit more focused.
Here.
That's a subway black card.
It entitles you to $5 footlongs for life.
For life, Mr. Winger, for life.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So What are you going to do?
I'm thinking I'm gonna transfer to City College, but I'm knowing I'm gonna be a bartender.
You?
Subway offered me a job.
Nice.
I'm worried about Abed and Annie.
They're not ready for this to end.
Yeah, they're part of the adulthood-begins-at-30 generation.
I'm I'm actually looking forward to a little bit of - Sanity?
- Yes, sanity.
Yeah, I mean, it's over, but on the other hand, it's over.
Amen.
And to think this all started because you wanted to Nail you.
Yeah, I regret nothing.
Don't.
I mean, after everything that has happened here, what did either of us really get done aside from each other?
Exactly, and what are either of us gonna be leaving with?
Um, I should go clean out my locker, she said at the age of 33.
Let's get married.
- What?
- Yeah, right?
I mean, this is what matters, isn't it?
This is what keeps this all from being pointless.
Let's do what people do.
Let's get a house we can't afford and a dog that makes us angry.
And dedicate an entire cabinet to grocery bags and realize we have a favorite brand of olive oil?
Yes, marry me.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah uh, yeah, this feels right.
Let's get out of here and never look back.
Yeah, but first, let's lock these doors and pull these shades.
We've never had sex on the new table.
Yes, two for two.
Medium roughness, high tempo?
Let's make it a number eight.
- Buried treasure!
- Whoo!
Buried treasure!
Lock the doors.
Close the blinds.
We could save Greendale, Jeff.
There may be treasure on campus.
Hidden, buried treasure.
Treasure!
We need to call an emergency meeting somewhere safe where no one can hear or see, because we have to keep this a secret, because it's a buried Treasure!
Buried treasure!
Buried treasure, buried treasure Buried treasure, buried treasure Buried treasure, buried treasure Buried treasure, buried treasure Buried treasure, buried treasure Buried treasure, buried treasure Interesting.
Emergency meeting.
And that's how I ended up at Greendale.
Isn't it strange how it took this school shutting down for you and I to finally get to know each other?
So what's up next for you?
Don't know, maybe go stay with family in Lincolnshire.
- Lincolnshire?
- Yeah.
Where in Lincolnshire?
Just a little town called Scunthorpe.
Scunthorpe?
I was stationed around Scunthorpe.
- No.
- Oh, wait, wait.
O'er the lady's smocks I tarry Through the hollyhocks and glen For a piss and a thrush in Scunthorpe Then it's off to Henningpen I love that.
Oh, where in God's name did you learn that song?
Stainsbury Pub.
My family practically lived in Stainsbury's.
I lost my virginity at Stainsbury's.
My mother was a Stainsbury whore.
Mine was missing a thumb.
Oh, my God.
Two thumbs, yeah, she got both.
Two thumbs.
I mean, you may have slept with my aunt, but given the circumstances, cheers.
- Cheers, yeah.
- Yeah.
Mm, so you're gonna stay with your family till you get your bearings?
I've got a cousin, Clive, who's got a spare room.
You and he would really get along, actually.
- Really?
- Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
This is Russell Borchert, computer genius, anti-deodorant activist, and millionaire.
He was rich for having invented the 9-track cassette, which the 8-track industry paid to keep quiet.
He funneled that wealth into a computer school called Greendale, where he obsessively pursued a new project, a machine that can process feelings.
He apparently used nothing but gold to assemble his circuitry, believing it to be a better conductor of human emotion.
It was a weird time.
The Bionic Woman won an Emmy.
Rumors spread about his relationship with computers, and one day, he disappeared, hence the legend that he died of the first computer virus.
The city bought the campus, and life went on.
His body was never found, nor was his immense wealth.
Some people said he hid his money using a portal to another dimension.
Those people were on LSD.
Everyone else said he had a secret vault in his office.
- Well, where's his office?
- Good question.
We found this confession written by Greendale's first Dean.
"To protect the student health and the school's reputation, "I have sealed off the computer department and removed the stairwell to that entire section".
A section that remains on this campus somewhere, its secrets untouched, including quite possibly Borchert's millions.
If we found it, we could buy it from the city before Subway.
Then I could really go nuts with this place.
This is the kind of adventure I usually have to force upon us, and here it is, falling into our laps.
We're like the Goonies, except our story tracks logically and has a chance of holding up to objective critical scrutiny.
- Can you please stop that?
- Sorry.
Here are your blueprints.
Sorry it took so long.
You can't fight city hall.
Apparently you can.
That's why it took so long.
Well, I'll be damned.
Would you look at that?
It's so clear now.
The entire school is shaped like a penis.
No, that.
It says right here that this stairway leads to sublevel three.
Is that where the teachers' lounge is?
What the hell does your penis look like?
Obviously a cluster of buildings, so let's all have a big laugh at the freak.
Give me some rope Tie me to dream Give me the hope To run out of steam Somebody said it can be here We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one, they all just fade away The missing stairwell would be in this area.
Keep your eyes peeled.
I don't know why, but serial killers and people that hide treasure always leave weird little clues.
Check it out.
Look at the bottle held by the school's first and least acceptable mascot, Big Chief Drunky.
X marks the spot, baby.
Maybe you shouldn't be Okay.
- Shirley, will you lock the door?
- Okay.
There you go.
It's just a bunch of wires.
Exactly what they want us to think.
Oh, my God.
Wait, wait, wait.
The sparks may be spelling out the next clue.
Is Duncan okay?
He'll live, but his food's gonna taste like burnt aluminum for a while.
It's pronounced "al-u-minium".
- See, he's fine.
- Okay, guys, stop it now.
Nobody wants to admit its over, but come on.
Oh, look, it's Jeff Winger, fun police, here to pull over our smiles 'cause our mouths have tinted windows.
Britta and I are getting married.
- What?
- Married?
Well, you're gonna need way more doves than this.
What does this look like, an hour-long episode of The Office?
There's pick-axing and electric zapping.
Don't even acknowledge it.
We are not acknowledging this.
You guys are ridiculous together.
We're ridiculous?
What do you call this?
- Secret trapdoor!
- Booyah.
Who's got rope?
I'm offended by that question.
This is Richie and Carl from the school board.
That's right.
We got names.
Open this door now.
Wait, I know where the keys are.
You hear that?
When we get there, you're gonna be in big trouble.
Here they are.
Here they are.
Which one is it?
Well, it's never the first one, so we can cancel this one out.
Come on.
I guess now this is the first one, so it should be the next one.
- Oh, damn.
- You know what?
I got it.
Get out of the way.
- Richie, be careful.
- Don't worry.
I've been drinking.
Oh, hello.
Would you like some tea?
The tea is swell.
- Do you think they - Shh.
- I think - Shh.
- Oh, come on, shh.
- Shh.
You know it's just as loud as Shh.
Everybody, shut up!
Guys, I think this is the lost section of Greendale.
Nobody's been in here since the '70s.
How do you know?
Because the debate team topic is "Who's hotter, Elliot Gould or Donald Sutherland"?
Donald Sutherland.
- Scary.
- Oh, relax.
If it's anything like a regular dungeon, it's only as dangerous as whoever invited you.
Abed, if there's killer robots down here, you'll tell them we're on your side, right?
Yes, but we won't know them from ordinary robots until they kill us.
- So what do we do now?
- Split up.
Leave no '70s reference unturned.
This decade's a little out of my wheelhouse.
Pet rock Leave no pet rock unturned.
Here, let me lead.
My light's better.
Your light's better?
You're that insecure that your light has to be better?
- Shut up.
- You shut up.
Anything in there?
Just spider webs and beanbag chairs.
Oh, don't cry.
The importance of lumbar support hadn't It's not that.
It's just even if we do save Greendale, which Greendale will we be saving?
First Pierce dies.
Then Troy leaves.
- Now people are - Getting married?
Annie, look, I don't know people, but I know TV.
When characters feel like the show they're on is ending, their instinct is to spin off into something safer, in Jeff and Britta's case, something that would last six episodes and have a lot of bickering about tweezers and gluten, starring them and an equally W.A.S.P.
-y brunette couple with a title like better with my worse half or awfully wedded or tying the not, but "knot" is spelt without a K, or #CouplePeopleProblems, and every episode, you get - Abed.
Abed, stop developing.
- Sorry.
The point is, this show, Annie, it isn't just their show.
This is our show, and it's not over.
And the sooner we find that treasure, the faster the Jeff-Britta pilot falls apart.
Got it.
Thank you, Abed.
You're welcome.
- I have a girlfriend.
- What?
You were about to start a kiss lean.
- I was not.
- Fine.
Let's go find treasure.
- Did you find anything?
- No.
We've searched every crevice of this place, and the only treasures we've found are this CB radio, these basketball cards with white people on them, and this little rocket launcher from some action figure.
Seems like an odd place for a dead end, though.
Could be a secret door.
Maybe the jukebox is the key to it.
Just remember, it's okay if we fail.
- Right, Jeff?
- That's right.
Agh, try every button.
Just try every single button ever.
- Are you all right?
- No!
I was dying!
- Try track 127.
- Right.
Because 127 in binary code would be a palindrome.
Because the song title is "Open the Door" by The Secret Doors.
- Open the door - Yeah - We got to open the door - And the door is opening You're the playing the song that opens the door We recorded this song for when you open the door Specially timed to the duration of the opening process Borchert's secret lab.
That's the machine Borchert was working on in the film.
Borchert's gold.
We need to get this upstairs.
Save Greendale.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You're Russell Borchert, aren't you?
Hey, I'm gonna peel off some band-aids here.
Dennis Hopper is dead, TV shows give no time for theme songs anymore, and Woody Allen did the voice of a cartoon ant.
Jeff!
Sorry, I lose track of how big I'm getting.
I don't.
You vandalized private property.
You nearly destroy the school when it's finally about to make a profit?
You guys are the worst, with your stupid paintballs and your freeze tags.
- Hot lava.
- That was hot lava?
Dumb.
Tell us where the others went.
Guys, guys.
- What do you want to do?
- What should we do?
Well, what can we do?
Okay.
I'm gonna need you guys to stay back and never tell anyone about what you saw here today.
You're special, Richie.
Your mind is special.
You know it works differently from other kids' minds.
Richie's a freak, Richie's a freak Thank you.
I know where they went.
They climbed out a window to the roof, hopped on a hang glider, and flew it across town to that Greek restaurant, Papa Cristo's?
I robbed your brain.
I robbed it.
Hey, guys, we found a hatch in the floor underneath the vending machine.
I think they went down inside it.
Was there a hang glider?
You're gonna find out You're gonna find a hang glider down there.
That much I know.
So anyway, I sealed myself up down here with 50 years of food, and 50 years of cocaine, which I somehow ran out of after about 10 years.
Wow, the '80s happened down here too.
Yeah.
Hey, what are you doing with Raquel?
Mm-mm, uh-uh.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Russell, we're on a bit of a deadline, and to put it bluntly, we need your gold.
- Raquel!
- Uh, guys, little help She just needs a little more time.
Sir, Raquel has taken the best years of your life and a dozen of your not-so-good.
If she hasn't given anything back, it might be time to move on.
Stop.
You guys, what are we doing?
- Saving Greendale.
- From what?
We were driven down here by sellouts with crappy values.
Since when do human beings decide which dreams are worthwhile?
Look at him.
He's one of us.
We have to respect each other enough to let each other want what we want, no matter how transparently self-destructive or empty our desires may be.
If it was money that you guys wanted, why didn't you say so?
You can just have my leftover cash that's under the desk over there.
Yeah, I don't think it's worth much up there.
- Those are Gerald Ford dollars.
- How many?
Eh, couple of million.
Back in the '70s, that was worth millions.
Hey, I've got an idea.
How about you people leave me alone and I hereby grant that to Greendale?
What?
Glad to hear it.
Get back.
This pickle's a magnet.
- Whoa, whoa.
- I'll wipe her out, man.
Don't you dare use that pickle Get over there with them.
You have no legal claim to that money.
Take it up with Subway in about an hour after close of escrow.
Hey, Chang, you've become a bad guy again?
There's a lot more to it than that, Britta.
Wait, I'm not wearing a mask?
Okay, there's no more to it.
I think I'm just mentally ill.
All right, just stay back.
All right?
No, don't.
No!
- Close the door - Yeah, sweet mama - We got to close the door - The door is closing - Faster than it opens - For dramatic effect - Hey!
- Hang in there.
Raquel is the main operating system.
She controls the door, the lights, the shower probably, everything, and now she's dead.
So we're trapped in here forever.
Or just until we run out of food and water.
At least we'll have each other.
Till death do us part.
You know what?
You guys can have my food and water.
Come on, Raquel.
Come on.
Baby.
Come on.
Oh, thank God.
Her emotional components are still on-line.
Emotional components?
I have accomplished things down here you couldn't even possibly imagine.
Here, let me show you.
Ah, right there!
That was it.
That was it.
Did you see it?
Don't you see?
This computer responds to feelings.
When I started Greendale, it was for ordinary people to be able to access technology.
Wait, you started Greendale.
Do you have that in writing anywhere?
I don't know.
Somewhere with all that crap over there.
But without an emotional component, computers would strip us of all humanity and create a society with emotionless eggheads at the top and idiots with feelings at the bottom, and I refuse to let that happen, and that's why I've spent What?
What is that?
It's a video of a kitten.
And why are those people arguing about it?
- And what's that?
- That's an emoticon.
That person wants to indicate happiness but can't convey it with language, so they misuse punctuation to form a smile.
That is so stupid.
Only an idiot would think of this.
Idiots won, which means my work down here is done.
Good, because according to what I'm seeing, if we can get you up there right now, Subway won't be buying this school.
- What?
- What?
Uh, yeah, but it's gonna take a few hours to get that door open, because Raquel's logic circuits bleh, not good.
You said her emotional components work.
Well, in theory, a blast of human passion could shock the mainframe into a cold start, but that's only if somebody in this room has feelings stronger than I get when I rub my nipples, so good luck with that, folks.
Give me that.
Everybody over there.
Turn around.
Turn around now.
You're here to save me, aren't you?
Let's get out of here and never look back.
Jeff, in case you ever have to remember me, can I give you some options for voice-over quotes?
Shut up, Abed.
- Milady.
- Milord.
What did you do?
Don't worry about it.
Let's go.
The city of Greendale is proud to be selling the school of Greendale to Subway.
This brings to an end several years of horrible management by Dean Craig Isidore Pelton.
Not to throw anyone under the bus, but he'd be the one.
And by my watch, it is about time to sign these documents and make it official.
Objection!
I teach law at Greendale, so believe me, I don't know much about law, but I do know a contract violation when I see one.
This is a legitimate transaction where a city is selling a school to a restaurant.
It happens somewhere every day.
Oh, the city can sell the school all it wants, but according to his contract with the city, the school's original founder retains the privilege of consultation on all future scholastic endeavors taking place here.
So Subway Sandwich University, meet your new Vice Dean, Russell Borchert.
Oh.
Hi, I guess we're gonna be partners.
I understand there's some internet where I can make my inner thoughts public.
It seems like Greendale the city and Greendale the school have some stuff to sort out, and Subway doesn't doesn't do conflict.
We do good food at good prices.
We are but simple sandwich artists who want the world to eat fresh.
Eat fresh!
Subway, ho!
Did we just save Greendale?
- Did we just save Greendale?
- No, no, you did not.
You moved dirt around Greendale's grave.
Your school is still bankrupt, it is still unmarketable, and it is still on the permanent chopping block of anyone who has any say in its future.
Yeah?
Well, around here, we call that Wednesday.
He wakes up in the morning Never changes a thing Hey, after I was electrocuted, didn't you two say you were gonna get married?
Doesn't electrocuted technically mean killed?
Do you always have to correct people like that?
Do you always have to police correcting?
That's it.
The marriage is off.
I think you mean the wedding is off.
- Yeah!
- Hey, hey.
Hey, I got to say, you held up well under that interrogation.
I'm gonna tell you something that I'd like to stay between us.
Oh.
I was thinking about a hang glider.
None of this conflict truly matters.
The only owners of this land are the Arapaho.
Would it offend you if I asked you to train me in the use of certain powers?
Sorry, Carl.
You deserve better.
Chang, you get it.
How would you like a job on the school board?
Okay.
Your first job is to deliver this to the city bursar's office.
On it.
Hi, yes, I'd like to replace all my teeth with diamonds.
We live to fight another day.
Speaking of days, I never got a chance to wish you a happy birthday or Halloween or Christmas or any specific calendar event.
- Well, maybe next year.
- Definitely.
We'll definitely be back next year.
If not, it'll be because an asteroid has destroyed all human civilization, and that's canon.
What?
What are you Hmm?
Nothing.
