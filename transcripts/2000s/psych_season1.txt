{START OF EPISODE 1}
You do your homework?
Uh-huh.
Finish those beets?
Yep.
Can I have the fudge cake?
Close your eyes.
Dad, I don't wanna Now.
Which letter is out in the exit sign?
The "X".
What color is the vinyl?
What's vinyl?
It's the stuff these seats are covered in.
Purple.
Maroon, close enough.
Manager's name?
Who?
She's wearing a name tag, the woman standing at the front door when we first walked in.
You saw her.
Marie.
Can I have the cake now?
How many hats?
Come on, Dad!
Shawn, you want a piece of cake?
How many hats are in the room?
Does a beanie count?
What do you think?
Three.
You didn't describe them.
That's not fair.
Time's almost up, Shawn.
One has a flower, the one the lady's wearing.
One has a picture of some kind of lion, on the weird guy with the crooked tooth.
The last one is on the chef.
What about the beanie?
A beanie's a cap, not a hat.
All right, open your eyes.
Thank you!
Wow, that's amazing.
It's adequate.
Get him his cake.
I guess I know what you're gonna be when you grow up.
Oh, I'm never gonna grow up, ma'am.
Nice place.
Thank you.
precipitation later on in the week, but all in all, a wonderful day to take a hike.
Now, back to you, Dana.
I knew you were gonna be my best table.
voicing her concerns regarding the department's long-time policies.
Joe, do the police have any leads at this time?
We're at a loss, we really don't know what else to do.
It's been a tough few weeks, we've basically run out of ideas.
Hopefully, the police will be able to crack this one for us.
Closing the books on Divisions' break-ins could be just the olive branch needed to set things in the right direction.
What are you doing?
I'm calling the police.
Any particular reason?
I think I just closed a case.
You didn't tell me you're a cop.
Oh, no, no, no.
Definitely not a cop.
Does that disappoint you?
I just thought you might have handcuffs.
Oh, I have handcuffs.
Hello?
Santa Barbara Police Department.
It's the store manager, he did it.
Pardon me?
The stereo robberies, at Divisions chain store.
He's on Channel 8 News right now.
His hands, nervous tick, dead giveaway.
And he won't look at the reporter in the eyes.
And your name is?
My name?
My name is Shawn Spencer.
And is there anything else today?
No, that's gonna do it.
retailers are waiting and hoping Actually, the tags on the news van have expired, but that's completely unrelated.
Hello, Officer.
Okay, but you gotta go.
It was awesome.
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
Hi.
It was amazing.
I'm Shawn Spencer.
And the other thing is Well, no, I'm not gonna pay for it.
Oh, no, no, no, that's not for me.
I'm here for a commendation.
I called in a tip.
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, Michelle, I can't pay for that.
Here's the thing, these are new pants.
Clearly, you feel very strongly about this.
Right.
Eighty dollars is a lot for a reading.
But she was astounding.
I mean, she knew about Granny's childhood, and the curios she left Bobby.
I mean, I could literally feel her spirit in the room.
Get out of here.
You know, I have the same tattoo.
They spelled bloodthirsty wrong on mine, can you believe it?
I cannot believe you didn't test that out first.
One, two three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
What'd you do?
Bust up your ex-wife's car?
Her new boyfriend's.
That'll teach her.
They got no witnesses.
Sweet.
You might wanna brush the shards of taillight off your sleeve.
Just a tip.
Gee, thanks, guy.
Sure.
Right this way, Mr. Spencer.
So, when do I get my money?
Money?
Yeah, the reward?
You guys arrested the store manager, am I right?
Why don't you let us ask the questions for a while?
Okay.
So, which questions might those be?
Oh, I don't know.
Like, where were you the night of the last robbery?
I was robbing a stereo shop.
I wasn't.
I don't know, I guess I was doing the same thing you were doing.
Not solving crime.
You're not helping your case here.
My case?
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm actually a suspect?
Oh, you're our lead suspect.
I gave you the guy.
He had a partner.
I have to find that guy?
I'm confused.
When do you start chipping in?
See, your information was good.
So good, it could only have come from the inside.
Inside of what?
Look, I've called in dozens of tips, okay?
Just check it out.
I did, I checked out a whole lot of stuff.
Like Oh, you're currently unemployed.
You've never held a job for more than six months, and you have a criminal record.
I was 18.
Oh, 18?
Well, that makes it okay, let me just scratch this out!
I borrowed a car.
You stole a car.
To impress a girl.
Look, forgive us, Mr. Spencer, if this seems far-fetched.
Would it help at all if I told you that she had a bit of a reputation and I was 0 for high school?
Okay, fine.
There were extenuating circumstances.
The arresting officer was my father, he was trying to teach me a lesson.
Did you learn it?
I learned I hated my father, so, sure.
Well, pardon me if I'm just a little skeptical.
Believable, as it is, that you solved all these crimes I'm sorry, what was it?
Watching the local Channel 8 News reports.
I confess.
That's not true.
Sometimes I watch Channel 5.
I prefer Channel 8.
The weather girl?
Adorable.
So you're telling us that you can read guilt off of TV interviews.
Can't you?
Don't you try and trivialize police work.
I think you're doing a bang-up job of that all by yourself.
You can't keep me here, guys.
I know my rights.
Good.
Then you know you have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you.
Wait a minute, you're serious?
A few hours in a holding cell might jog your memory.
Just give us a reason, Mr. Spencer.
That's all we need.
How did you get this information?
No, it is too late for that.
Officer Allen, book him.
Book him?
Oh, come on, cuffs?
What?
For the walk back to the lobby?
Or, you could give us a plausible explanation.
Okay, okay.
Fine, you win.
I got the information because I'm psychic.
Get him out of here.
Oh, boy.
Your grandma would be so proud.
You spoke to her?
I did.
She's safe, comfortable.
She wants you to stop spending all your money on those charlatans.
The palm readers?
The palm readers.
Okay, just to be clear, you're claiming to be a psychic, Mr. Spencer.
How else would I know that you two are sleeping together?
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One When's the wedding?
May 3rd.
Wait, how'd you know?
I'm getting dance lessons for a wedding reception.
And you are getting good.
Wow, that's amazing.
Oh, come on.
Who's buying this?
I got it.
Go to detention room number two, shake down your vandal.
You'll find all the evidence you need.
All the evidence is in his left shoe.
We'll be back here in three minutes.
With my own cuffs!
Whoa!
I'm getting I am getting the letter "L".
Lulu!
Her dog!
Is there anything else she said?
There's suddenly a very, very negative presence here.
It's blocking me.
That was a lucky guess.
A lucky guess?
He planted it.
I don't know.
His alibi checks.
Question.
Do I pay taxes on reward money?
I'll find out.
Please, feel free to call anytime.
You know I will.
Magic touch!
Doctor?
Hey, yeah.
Not so fast, Mr. Spencer.
Karen Vick, Interim Police Chief.
I know.
Heard about what you did in there.
Oh, you're welcome.
That wasn't the phrase I was going to use.
I was going to say, improbable.
Possible, yet unlikely.
Look, it's hard to explain.
I'm gifted.
I was born that way.
I knew your father, he was a good cop.
You're nothing like him.
I take that as a compliment, ma'am.
Don't ever call me "ma'am.
" Am I still free to go?
Not exactly.
You familiar with the McCallum family?
McCallum?
Yeah, they own half the hill.
Well, there's been a kidnapping.
Oh, come on.
I had nothing to do with that.
Would you like to?
The feds are itching to jump in on this case, and I need to make some progress.
What I need is a miracle, or a facsimile of one.
Oh.
I see, I see.
Well, I make $1,200 a day.
It's a tryout.
That's what I meant to say.
This is pro bono, something for you.
And if this psychic thing is a scam, we will prosecute.
You know hindering a police investigation is a criminal offense?
Sounds good!
We're on the same team now!
Kidnappers beware!
I have a job for you.
I already have a job.
They're paying you to play video games?
How do you do that?
Come on, left hand, space bar, right hand, arrow keys?
Gus, you should ask me a challenging question every once in a while, just for kicks.
I can't go anywhere.
I'm behind on my route.
I've got new samples of serum moxacillin.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize the new butt cream had come in.
So, you're not interested in hearing about doing the thing we've been dreaming of doing since we were eight?
I've got us the last job we will ever need.
Shawn, you've had 57 jobs since we left high school.
Yes, I have.
And they were all fun, but this one takes the cake.
Oh, yeah?
Better than your acupuncture clinic?
I didn't realize experience was necessary.
What about the summer you spent driving the wiener mobile?
I did that for the hot dogs.
Look, Gus, all those jobs I took because I wanted the experience.
But then I mastered it and I moved on.
But this job has a little bit of everything.
Come with me.
No.
I'm never doing anything blindly with you again.
I learned that at the Mexican border, twice.
Okay, this is hard to explain, but I'm going to give it a shot.
You and I are opening our own private detective agency.
Oh.
See?
No explanation necessary.
Let me get my coat.
But you're not getting your coat.
No, no, Shawn, I'm not.
All right, you want to sweat the details?
Fine.
The cops think I'm a psychic and now we are investigating a kidnapping.
You're serious?
Yes, I am serious!
Six days ago, Camden McCallum, Jr., sole male heir to McCallum Textiles, was seen being forced into his Range Rover at the municipal dog park.
No one has seen him or the dog since.
They took the dog?
You see what I mean?
I need you!
I need you to write stuff down.
'Cause you know how I zone out when other people talk.
Just for today?
Just today.
Oh, and you know what?
You should bring your sample case, because some of those forensics guys probably Whoa!
There's gonna be forensics guys there?
All right, pay attention.
Eighteen months ago, Camden McCallum ran his father's Cigarette boat into the Morrow Bay aquarium.
That was right after he got caught with that hockey player's wife.
Yeah, I remember that.
The guy hadn't been out of the paper in five years.
Since that day, nothing.
Not a single news story.
Not so much as a dented motorcycle.
Okay.
What do you think?
I think Camden McCallum is too good at what he does to stop.
Not cold turkey, anyway.
Beautiful women, fast cars.
It doesn't add up.
Something happened.
How should we introduce ourselves?
And don't say psychic, they'll shut you off.
Say something vague, like Alternative Tactics Division.
How about the Bureau of Magic and Spell-casting?
Where you going?
You're rooting through the trash?
Just for a second.
You are, without doubt, the worst detective I've ever seen.
Gus, everything you need is right in front of you.
You just have to pay attention.
Oh, yeah?
Look at this.
Berenson's brand.
That is the highest quality dog food on the market.
Perfect.
They pamper their pets.
The case is almost solved.
This stuff is really expensive.
No additives, no preservatives.
Why would you possibly open three bags simultaneously, when you only have one dog?
They're rich, they waste money.
Oh, my God!
What?
This CD case is totally nice.
Why would someone throw this out?
Here, put this in the car.
Inside, now.
Is it entirely too early for me to have a theory?
Can you at least wait until we see some evidence?
I suppose I could if it'd make you happier.
Whoa.
Remember, just act natural.
They know.
How could they know?
They know.
We haven't said anything yet.
They know, I can feel it.
Oh, you're a psychic now, too?
You're not a psychic!
Gus, let's just be clear on one thing.
The only way they can absolutely prove that I am not a psychic, is if I tell them.
And I can guarantee you, that is the one thing I will never do.
Check this out.
You got a lead?
No, but look at this girl.
She must be the sister.
Wow, she's incredible.
We kind of have a few other things going on right now, Shawn.
Oh, Gus, look.
Look how she went from this awkward stage with this really unfortunate perm, to this beautiful, amazing girl.
I mean, she's a late bloomer, but what does that mean?
That means depth of character.
Gus, she kayaks.
What, are you Lamaze breathing?
It helps.
I cover a few birthing centers.
Just let me know when the contractions are two minutes apart.
She reads Vonnegut.
Wow!
She's an aviatrix.
Gus, I bet this girl is spectacular.
Really, now?
I'm Katarina McCallum.
I am thoroughly embarrassed.
I'll bet you are.
I'm sorry.
I'm Shawn Spencer.
The Chief called me in.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Thank you for saying that.
I have the same feeling.
What makes you think so?
I'm a psychic.
They called in a psychic?
I have very unique and special abilities.
Well, Shawn Spencer, if you need to ask any questions Just one.
Do you currently have a boyfriend?
Is that pertinent?
It very well could be.
Well, yes, I'm sort of seeing someone, nothing serious, though.
Nothing too serious.
That's good, that's very good.
I think that's it for now.
I'll be in touch.
How do you luck into these women all the time?
Gus, please.
I'm a professional, gathering information.
What are we looking for?
Pictures of that Katarina girl.
Preferably at the beach, maybe on her way to yoga.
Or at a Halloween party, dressed as a cat.
What are those for?
It's for anxiety.
Is it ethical to sample your own samples?
Mr. Spencer, the sketch artist is here for you.
The sketch artist.
The Chief insisted.
Interim Chief.
Yeah, you call her that.
I'll be right back.
Oh, yeah, that's nice.
Yeah, with the shading The shading's nice.
Here's a question.
Do you think you could have him looking further to the left?
Like, his eye-line further to the left?
Shawn?
Yeah?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, yeah.
So, just more to the left and I think we're there.
All right.
What's up?
What are you doing?
Just work with me.
Tell them you're blocked or something.
I'm gonna have to use that later.
How we looking over there?
Oh, that's great, now Look how good that is!
See how he's looking off to the left like he sees something.
Now, as far as the hair goes, can we get the bangs wispier, like he's trying to compensate for, like, maybe he's thinning in the back and he's sort of got a swoop?
Oh, my gosh!
It's Bill!
Oh, it's Bill!
Oh, honey!
Come here, Bill's the kidnapper!
That's the exact cap I gave him!
Okay, everybody stop.
No, no!
I'm sorry.
Bill is not the kidnapper.
Not the kidnapper.
Bill is just a horrible human being.
Who is Bill?
I'm getting multiple women.
Is he a bigamist?
A pimp?
Does he sell children on the black market?
What Mr. McCallum?
I'm Shawn Spencer, the psychic.
Well, thank you for coming.
If there's anything I can do.
I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you, sir.
Nothing can prepare you for something like this, knowing you can't do anything.
Call me anytime with any questions.
Actually, I do have one question, sir.
How did he feel about the dog?
Well, he loved that damn thing.
Didn't do anything without it.
Yeah.
That'll do it.
Thank you, sir.
Does he like his dog?
That's how you investigate?
I think we're making progress.
Since you've been here, all you've done is dig through the trash, hit on the victim's sister, and falsely accuse her boyfriend.
Gus, he is not her boyfriend.
She made a point to say they're free to see other people.
Whatever you say, Shawn.
Have a blast.
I quit.
You can't quit.
We just got started.
Watch me.
Gus, you're gonna miss everything.
It's gonna be fun.
Gus, get back here!
Fine.
I'll solve this case by myself.
Gus, I hate to imagine what the rest ofyour plan was.
How did you get in?
Far less effective on a second-floor landing.
What do you want, Shawn?
Can I say something about the case, please?
No.
I was right.
I'm done, Shawn.
I don't want to commit felonies, and perjury, and pretend to be You're dying to know who kidnapped him, I know you are.
No, no, I'm not.
Because I don't believe that you can solve a crime the cops can't by simply walking through a house.
Fine.
Fine.
All right, whatever.
Who kidnapped him?
Nobody.
Nobody.
Excellent.
Call the Chief at home, tell her the crime is solved.
Because, apparently, we just imagined the whole thing.
Gus, nobody kidnapped him because he did it himself.
Come on, see for yourself.
Okay, here's the thing.
Camden didn't offer to clean up his act voluntarily.
Oh, no.
Daddy threatened to cut him off permanently.
This was about Eighteen months?
But wait, there's more.
He had help.
Who?
This guy on the end.
Malcolm Orso.
Only member of this crew that didn't go on to fame, or fortune, or rehab.
The cops must've talked to him.
Nope.
Malcolm hasn't been seen with Camden for quite some time.
To be exact Eighteen months.
Almost to the day.
Gus, he has been planning this thing for almost a year.
Shawn, this is good.
Yeah.
Where did you get this?
Katarina McCallum's room.
You didn't go in her room!
Gus, I needed a ride.
She hadn't eaten yet.
One thing led to another, and we ended up sharing a milkshake.
Whoa!
Wait a second!
Wait a second.
You're dating her?
No, not dating.
Yes, you are!
It's not exclusive.
What?
Gus!
Come on!
Put some clothes on.
This is gonna be fun.
Let's go.
I'm driving, where are your keys?
Never mind!
I got them!
Should I slice this up for the road?
Well, we're off to a banner start.
Just let me do the talking.
Morning, gentlemen.
Hello, Officer.
What's this?
Oops!
That's my dad's old police business card, must've stuck at the back there.
I guess I've been carrying that in my wallet for ages.
Can never be too careful, coming from a family of cops.
Henry Spencer's your dad?
Yes, yes, he is.
Well, how's old Henry doing?
Oh, you know Henry, he's great.
Retired, living in Miami.
I saw Henry three weeks ago at the Home Depot.
Yeah, yeah, that sounds about right.
He popped into town for a few days, grabbed some supplies, some wood.
He said he'd been back for over a year.
And now, he's back.
Running around, doing his thing, Henry-style.
Tell your dad "the kingfisher" says hello.
Will do.
Thank you, Officer.
Your dad's back at the house?
Apparently.
Dude, I'm so excited.
This is my first use of spy technology.
Yeah, it would seem much cooler if it didn't have Sports Illustrated pasted on the side.
It came with the subscription.
Are you gonna tell me why we're here?
This is the Orso family cabin, where young Malcolm and young Camden spent all their summers growing up.
Wouldn't the police have checked this out?
Malcolm is so far out on the periphery of Camden's life.
He's not on the witness list, he's not on anybody's list.
This is a great plan.
Camden McCallum deserves to be commended.
Maybe you should date him, too.
Maybe I will.
Let me see.
Let me see here.
Oh, no way!
What?
It's Camden's dog!
Get Dude!
Dude.
Oh, my gosh!
I can't believe we did this!
This is unbelievable!
What!
What!
Okay, okay, wait.
Look.
Okay, wait.
Let's call the cops.
No, no, no, let's call the Chief!
That's what we're gonna do.
Call the Chief.
Yeah!
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Gus, Gus!
What?
We don't call anyone.
What?
Then later, at headquarters, I suddenly and miraculously have a vision.
A vision?
A vision of stuff we saw!
Like the road sign with the two bullet holes.
Like the red kayak, the yellow kayak, and the highway.
With numbers?
Oh, I'm seeing What am I seeing?
Eight, three, one We're on Highway 138.
Exactly.
In the spirit world, things get jumbled and out of sequence.
But my premonition becomes clearer when we all jump in the squad car together.
By the way, let me sit next to that junior detective Shawn, please.
And, alas, we'd lead them here.
And finally, we both put on our surprised faces as I guide them to the cabin for the first time.
This is mine.
What do you got?
Gus, that's horrible!
It doesn't convey surprise at all!
Gus!
All right, let me do the talking.
Is there even an option?
No, I want a lot of witnesses for my miraculous vision.
Yeah, yeah.
There they go.
There they go.
Detectives!
Detectives!
Detectives!
We have a breakthrough.
It is very important.
I also have something important, I call it lunch.
Make an appointment.
No, no, but this is You don't have my interest.
You don't have my ear.
Find a beat cop, tell your story, maybe I'll read the report.
Good day, gentlemen.
After you.
Detective, don't eat the chicken.
"Don't eat the chicken"?
He's got your number.
He's got nothing.
I'll have the chicken enchilada, extra chicken.
Okay.
I'll have the cheese quesadilla.
Coming right up.
Coward.
You're mad because he pegged us as a couple.
Please, he was tipped off.
Did you tell anyone?
Why would I tell anyone?
Let everyone think I'm working my way up the ladder the hard way?
You're barely separated!
It's been five months!
So, the plan was to annoy them into believing you.
Billy Camp's working the grill.
So?
So?
Billy Camp has the worst hay fever I've ever seen.
Feel this wind?
Feel it?
I'll be right back.
Here we go.
Act natural.
Okay, what is it?
All right, this is great.
Now what?
Does anyone have any binoculars?
No.
No, you see, we don't carry binoculars.
Oh, never mind, I found some here in my pocket.
There it is!
Just like I saw it!
You wanna tell me what I'm looking for, please?
I'm not sure, exactly.
I see a bone.
What, a human bone?
No, no, rawhide, and a ball.
Holy crap.
Call for backup.
What?
What do you see, Detective?
I can't believe they won't let us in.
This is lame.
And you were so polite when you asked the SWAT team to issue you the Luger.
Just make sure you act in awe of me when they come to say I was completely right.
Oh, and maybe a little afraid, like my powers could possibly be used for evil.
Oh, watch out!
Watch out!
Whoa, whoa!
For what, its tongue?
That thing could be vicious!
Yeah, and diabolical with its calculated decoy tail-wagging.
There's blood on its whiskers.
That's not blood, that's Snausages.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Either that, or he just mauled a mountain lion.
Come on, Gus.
Mr. Spencer, follow me.
Now, if there's any press, make sure you mention our agency.
We don't have an agency.
Yes, we do.
I applied for a DBA online, which reminds me, we're gonna need a name.
"Mindmasters"?
Already taken.
Make sure you tell them that we do private cases, because I bet the department's only gonna be good for one or two a month.
You tell them.
I can't.
I'm secretive, mysterious, enigmatic.
Delusional.
Remember, act surprised.
Wow, it is just like I saw before.
Pardon me, ladies, gentlemen.
The department has been approved to call on you again, Mr. Spencer.
And even though this case didn't end up exactly the way we'd hoped, I thank you for your services.
You were invaluable.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're making a huge mistake.
This case isn't closed.
Pardon me?
Murder, suicide?
Come on, you're buying that?
I'm not buying anything.
Those are the facts.
I buy it.
I understand, I do.
You'd like to shut the book on this as quickly as possible.
That's fine.
They had a falling-out.
Before they got the ransom money?
Why?
What did they have to fight about before they got the cash?
Might I remind you, Mr. Spencer, you are not a detective.
I just need to speak to the witnesses again.
The McCallum family has been through enough, and this conversation is over.
Thank you.
We parked in the parking structure, do you validate?
Would it make any difference if I told you Camden McCallum, Jr. spoke to me?
From beyond the grave.
Shut the door on your way out.
Damn it.
What are you doing?
That was the Chief of Police.
Interim Chief.
And have you considered that Camden McCallum may have been alive the first time we went to that cabin?
No.
Well, I have!
I need to talk to that guy.
Whoa, whoa, no!
Come on, Gus, just for a second.
The man is practically almost my father-in-law.
Make no mistake, Shawn, I will kill you.
Okay, I appreciate the fact that you think you can beat me up.
But I think our last scuffle proves otherwise.
Are you talking about the Cinnamon Festival?
Yes!
You do remember!
Okay, first of all, I was six, and I had a cast!
Which many would construe as a clear advantage.
It's like having a weapon attached to your arm.
Oh, great, now the Chief is staring right at us.
Mr. McCallum?
Chief wants him left alone.
Well, we all want to be left alone.
Yeah, some more than others.
What's with his wrist?
You don't give up, do you?
I do give up, all the time.
But not until the moment is right.
Now, come on, I know you don't think this adds up, either.
Okay, rumor is, he tried to off himself.
Off himself.
The war hero?
The man who's seen everything?
No, that's not it.
That's definitely not it.
You know everything, don't you?
Yeah.
It's scary, isn't it?
Look, something is going on, and I'm gonna find out what it is.
No, you're not going anywhere near that man.
In fact, I'm gonna make certain you never hear from the department again.
Whoa!
I'm getting strong vibrations that you might be wrong.
I'm onto you.
You've got a source somewhere, and I'm gonna find it.
You think this is some sort of game?
I'm not gonna let you just waltz around here like some kid in a candy store.
Let me be honest with you, Detective.
I used to work in a candy store, and it's nothing like this.
You're in over your head, mystic.
Hi, Dad.
Shawn.
You didn't tell me you moved back.
You didn't tell me you moved away.
That was different.
Was it?
Yeah, I was busy trying to help my mom through her divorce.
Well, it's nice to see you, too, son.
Can I come in?
No.
I was on my way out to lunch.
You can come with me if you don't bring this thing.
When I was in the department, there were two things I hated in this world.
Private investigators, and psychics.
Congratulations, kid.
You just hit the disappointment exacta.
Thank you, thank you very much.
It sort of happened by accident.
What are you gonna do when you get caught?
Move out of town?
I'm not gonna get caught.
Shawn, this is just like everything else.
Three months from now, you're gonna be on a bus going to Minneapolis 'cause you found your calling as a weatherman.
It's not like that this time.
Have you been listening to me?
I've finally figured out a way to use my special gift.
You should be thrilled!
You're the one that made me this way.
I'm good at this.
Oh, I see, you're so good at it, what are you doing knocking at my door?
You think I came to you for help.
Okay.
There was no ransom drop.
I'm not gonna be a part of this.
Come on, would you just hear me out?
Okay, no ransom drop, so what?
Big deal.
So, six days, nothing?
Not even a demand?
It happens all the time.
That's not unprecedented.
They try to create panic in the family.
Yeah, I know, I know.
But not this guy.
This guy wanted it done quickly.
I know that.
Well, then you missed something.
You've been driving your motorcycle all across the country, working your bungee cord jumping expeditions, you're soft.
Hey, pal, it happens.
I'm not soft.
I'm sharper than I've ever been.
Close your eyes.
No way, I'm not seven.
Close your eyes.
Any longer, I'll think you're cheating.
How many hats are in the room?
All right, fine.
Just in case you're trying to pull a fast one, I'm not counting the one in your pocket.
Nylon fishing hat on the loner in the corner.
Foam cap on the kid who's too young to know they were lame the first time they came out.
Both truckers.
One a concrete company I've never heard of, the other advertising free mustache rides.
I'm fairly certain no one's taken him up on that offer.
Norwegian girl, ponytail pulled out the back.
Unfortunately, she's married, and our friendly bartender, wearing the official hat of the restaurant.
Six hats.
And?
That's it.
Sorry, pal, there are seven hats.
I can't help you.
You missed something.
I didn't miss anything.
There are seven hats, Shawn.
Were.
Before I closed my eyes.
Cowboy-hat walked out while I was ridiculing mustache-rides.
Come on, I heard her boots.
All right, close enough.
Close enough?
No, I nailed that.
Yeah, but you changed the rules.
But, hey, if it makes you happy.
Changed the rules?
I did not change the rules.
What I did was nail it, and you know it!
Shawn, you want my advice?
Go out, get yourself a real job, grow up.
In the meantime, you might wanna ask yourself who you're trusting in this case and maybe you shouldn't.
'Cause obviously, you're overlooking somebody.
Thanks for lunch.
Why are we at the McCallum offices?
What is the magnification on these things?
Two X. Okay, we need to stop at Wal-Mart on the way home.
Why don't you just take your big, loud motorcycle?
Oh, here we go, here we go!
Oh, hell, no!
You got me out of work so you could stalk a girl?
Damn it, what is he doing here?
I can't believe this.
What's up with his hair?
It's horrible.
I knew I should've had him picked up for questioning.
That is not the way a grown man kisses a grown woman.
We're fine.
Why does she look so nervous?
Oh, no.
Is it just me, or does that bag look like it's filled with stacks of ransom money?
Give me that.
Oh, my God!
Katarina It was her!
You're dating a murderer.
Not exclusively.
Wow.
You see, I knew there was a reason she went for you so easily.
She wasn't lying, Gus.
I know when people are lying.
Oh, yeah?
Apparently not.
You just got played.
Should we call the cops?
Too late for that.
You could pretend you had a vision of a girl totally manipulating you.
Would you stop?
Thanks What should we do?
What should we do?
There's only one thing to do.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
Shawn?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Helping.
You're supposed to stay in the car!
You didn't tell me!
Well, come on!
Gus, you locked the car?
It's a bad neighborhood!
What in the world is going on, Shawn?
I know what's in the bag.
You do?
You're good, very good.
I didn't consider who would be the sole heir to the McCallum fortune if Camden was out of the picture.
Wait, okay, hold on.
You think I want my family's money?
Well, you don't need it, do you?
Now that you've got this money!
We've got to get better binoculars.
Katarina Go buy the bag.
What, you want a souvenir of your ineptitude?
I need to get a better look inside the bag.
I'm not going in there.
That guy wants to kill us.
Gus, this guy works in a thrift store.
Okay?
He's a big, furry-hearted, Good Samaritan.
Come on, I'll be right here.
Go ahead.
Mmm-hmm.
What the hell do you want?
Can I have the bag?
Are you serious?
Just the bag, not the clothes.
I'll pay you for it.
Oh, you've got some nerve coming in here.
I can't believe this.
Neither can I. I've gone to jail for less than you.
Jail's no fun, I'll tell you that much.
Oh, you've been?
Once, in Monopoly.
Okay, hold on, hold on!
Who's that?
Hey, hey!
Hey!
Get back here!
Go, go, go!
I can't believe you sold me out like that!
You didn't tell me I was a decoy!
Of course you're the decoy!
It seems pretty clean.
What, they didn't happen to leave a ransom note inside?
Give me some money.
Get your own money.
Gus, I'll give it back.
Seriously, this is all you carry?
Okay, so, we've got five stacks going across, and you figure four going longways.
Ten stacks in each pile, based on the wear and the indentation.
I don't know, depending on the denomination, this could easily be $5 million.
You're kidding.
Yeah, give or take.
You got that from the groove on the side?
Oh, come on, Gus.
Any small child could have figured that out.
So somebody at that house did pay a ransom.
Mmm-hmm, or tried to.
Who?
I don't know.
We're gonna need more than my psychic powers to figure this out.
You here to scope out the new meter maids?
Nope, I'm here to see you.
Not interested.
I know, you have someone special.
He's married and/or separated.
Is there a point to this, Mr. Spencer?
Of course.
You and I have something in common.
What's that?
We both know this case is nowhere near closed.
Unfortunately, gut feelings aren't admissible in a California court.
How about motive?
What do you have?
Nothing yet.
But I've seen something.
Seen, or seen?
Well, what do you think?
Okay, what do you need?
Everything you have on Malcolm Orso.
He was Camden's accomplice.
I'll get fired.
Will you really?
Because it seems like a gray area to me.
That's the problem with you, Mr. Spencer.
You live your entire life in a gray area.
That's not true.
Though I generally vacation in gray areas.
We can't talk here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.
It says Orso was seen in the town, near the cabin.
Yeah.
Twice.
Early in the week by a store owner.
What was he buying?
Nothing.
The old man just saw him on the street.
The same old man sees him two times?
Yeah.
Orso had one of those modified mufflers on his Nova.
You could hear him a block away.
You'll need a new target sheet.
Oh, no, no, this is This is fine.
Wow.
They're so much lighter when they're filled with water.
You missed.
Did I really?
Look at that.
It's a perfect match.
Damn!
I'm telling you, there's no way Katarina's gonna talk to you.
Yeah, well, I sort of lied about that part.
We're not here to see Katarina.
Who are we here to see?
This is highly inappropriate, Mr. Spencer.
The investigation is over.
What if they got the wrong man?
And who would the right man be?
You.
Mr. McCallum, I didn't have anything to do with this.
I killed my own son?
Makes you feel any better, I don't think you meant to.
You're not a detective.
You're not even a cop.
You're right, I'm a psychic.
And I saw the whole thing.
I see a ransom drop.
You're doing everything they ask, you didn't call the police, you're thinking of nothing but the security of your son.
After all, what's $5 million to you?
You're driving away, I can see it.
Something strange happens.
You recognize the car.
You pass it on the hill.
It's Malcolm Orso's.
You've seen it hundreds of times at your house, ever since high school.
Maybe it confirms the suspicion that you already have.
You know where they are.
You know the cabin.
He's making coffee.
You didn't mean to kill him, did you?
No, just knock him around a little bit, teach him a lesson.
But he falls to the floor, he slams his head on the oak table.
He's dead.
You know he's dead.
Orso walks in, finds you.
He's got a half-assed pistol, but he's no criminal.
You know there's only one way to cover your tracks.
You take care of him, too.
Make it look like a suicide.
Then, you come home, inform the police, and you wait.
You wait for a ransom call that will never come.
Police eat it up.
It's easy to look shaken after all you've done.
You might even be willing to take your own life.
You have an overactive imagination.
Perhaps a side-effect of your gift.
Shawn, we need to go.
Not yet.
I'm about to throw up on a Turkish carpet.
No, you're not.
It's in my esophagus.
The second door on the left, turn on the fan and flush.
I will not have this incident rehashed over and over again.
I know what your relationship was with your son.
Oh, really?
I have a father that I disappoint all the time.
I'm sure you do.
I know how you feel.
This was it.
This was the straw that broke the camel's back, wasn't it?
To think, 18 months ago, he sat across from you, looked you right in the eye and said, "Dad, I'm gonna clean up my act this time.
"This time, I'm gonna change, I swear.
" To know that he duped you and you fell for it all over again, must've sent you into a state that even you can't believe.
Mr. Spencer, I've been assured by the Lieutenant Governor that this case will not cast a pall over my family.
But I can assure you, it's gonna cast one over yours.
My very first case, I'm already being threatened.
Wow!
Shawn, let's go.
I'm not quite finished.
We're going, now.
Listen to your friend.
I'll be back.
No, you won't.
Okay, we're going.
We're clearly going.
All right!
Dude, what are you doing?
We had him on the ropes.
It wasn't the right tack.
Oh, you're the expert now?
Consumine.
What?
Consumine.
It's for dog bites.
I have some samples.
Gus, what are you saying to me?
I'm saying there was a bottle of it in the medicine cabinet, prescribed Wednesday.
You wonder why he had on that long-sleeved shirt in the heat that first day?
Oh, my gosh!
That dog did have blood on its teeth.
I told you it wasn't Snausages.
We're never getting back in there.
I know.
Just give me a second.
What are you doing?
I'm thinking.
You look ridiculous.
Now what are you doing?
Calling the cops.
For what?
You heard the guy in there.
They're never gonna come.
I'm not calling the cops on him, I'm calling the cops on us.
Gus, we need this to play out in front of an audience, with all the major players in place.
Santa Barbara Police Department.
Yes, hello.
I'm calling from the McCallum residence.
There's an intruder here.
He simply won't leave.
He's claiming to be a psychic that works for your department.
Pardon me?
Mr. McCallum is enraged and he wants this handled by the highest authority possible.
Please send the Chief immediately.
Did you really vomit?
Who called them?
I don't know, sir, maybe the back staff.
Those two gentlemen have not left the driveway.
Would you like me to send them all away?
No, let's finish this.
As you can see, Karen, this simply cannot happen.
It'll be taken care of, believe me.
He was given clear instructions to stay away.
I understand, but Yeah, it's times like this I remember why I love my job so much.
Anytime, Shawn.
He's getting cocky, give it a sec.
We're gonna be at city jail in a sec.
Uh-huh.
Here we are.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did that hurt?
Something's happening!
Gus, something's happening!
Stop it.
Wait.
The dog!
Shut up.
He's biting the intruder!
He knows him.
It's someone he knows!
The dog knows him!
Stop talking!
Ouch!
The teeth are digging in!
Shut up!
Now there's blood!
It's him, it's McCallum!
I can see his face!
The killer is McCallum!
Check his wrist!
Check his right wrist!
The teeth marks will match up!
Get him out of here!
Check the wrist!
No one is checking any part of me!
Why not?
Huh?
We could close this out immediately, discredit him right here.
That's an awful wound you have bandaged there.
This is outrageous!
Do you really want to do this?
I could do this now, or I could call in a warrant.
I'll call my lawyer.
I'll be right here.
I see a doctor!
I'm seeing a doctor, Dr. Mandali, and a word, "Consumine"!
Yeah, it's for dog bites!
The wound is fresh!
Check the wound!
It's a fresh wound, it's still a fresh wound!
It was an accident, I didn't What?
Sergeant.
This way, sir.
You wanna take these cuffs off of me, please?
Thank you.
Seriously, how?
I wish I knew.
Do you think this pretty much ruins my chances with Katarina?
There she is!
Don't ever walk into my office without knocking.
I'm sorry, I got excited.
You know what I'll do to you?
Yes.
You do?
I'm a psychic.
I am just finishing up in here, I'll be with you in a moment.
That's all right, Karen.
I've got to get going anyway.
Thank you very much for coming down.
Yeah.
Okay.
You've been a big help.
Son.
Dad.
Have a seat.
I was considering adding you to my speed dial, Mr. Spencer, but I would be remiss if I didn't do a little background check, don't you think?
Yes.
I asked your dad how long you've had the gift.
Look, my father's memory is pretty cloudy.
It certainly is.
His recollection doesn't match up with your assertion at all.
I can explain that.
You said you've had this ability your whole life.
Well, whole life I mean, it's a bit of a gray area.
He said you didn't get it until you were 18.
He said that?
Mmm-hmm.
Wow, that is just like him.
The man simply refuses to acknowledge my abilities, my gifts.
Can we discuss my fee?
There's a check in the cage.
Sign for it, and then come back in.
Come Come back in here?
Mmm-hmm.
Why?
You familiar with a chop shop in Summerland?
Dad!
So, are you gonna continue with this little charade?
Well, it sort of gives me carte blanche, you know?
I mean, I can work cases for the department, I can do private jobs.
In fact, I've already got another case.
Be aware.
This is the last time I cover for you, pal.
I'm not okay with this, Shawn, any of it.
I don't expect you to be, Dad.
Awesome!
Psych?
As in gotcha.
Or as in psychic.
You named your fake detective agency Psych?
Why don't you just call it, "Hey, we're fooling you and the police department.
"Hope we don't make a mistake and somebody dies because of it.
" First of all, Gus, that name is entirely too long, it would never fit on the window.
And, secondly, the best way to convince people you're not lying to them, is to tell them you are!
Whatever, Shawn.
It's your agency, go for it.
Actually, it's our agency.
I put your name on the lease as well.
Tell me, does that look anything like your signature?
I gave it a shot.
This better be a joke.
Don't worry, you won't have to do a thing.
I've worked out every last detail.
What's your dental plan?
Don't get cavities.
Health plan?
Same, but with hepatitis and shingles.
So, I'm supposed to quit my job, skip over and do this for no guaranteed money.
No guaranteed money, but all guaranteed fun.
No.
No more cases, Shawn.
It was fun for a few days.
Well, it's gonna have to be fun for a minimum of six months, or we'll have to pay a lease penalty, which would be a blemish on your otherwise very impressive credit report.
You solved one mystery, and now you're renting office space?
Gus, I've solved a bunch of mysteries.
For instance, the mystery of who kept stealing your newspaper.
Answer: me!
The mystery of what we're doing this weekend.
Hint, it involves dragsters.
And finally, the mystery that is the case the Chief just brought me in on.
You got another case already?
A car thief got poisoned by his boss.
He used something over the counter.
Fizadine.
No, Fizaderbal.
No Fizadrine?
That's it!
Wow.
How'd he do that?
I'll tell you on the way.
Just for today, right?
Absolutely.

{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Excuse me, you're in my seat.
Am I?
Actually, yes, you are.
You one of those weirdo compulsives who come to the same restaurant, sit in the same chair, and eat the same food every day?
No, no, no, I was sitting right there three minutes ago, and then I went outside to get myself a paper.
I ordered a juice, and look, I made a crawling snake with the straw wrapper.
You can finish it if you think you're up to the job.
I'm sorry.
You want me to move?
Not anymore.
So, what's up?
I don't have time to talk.
But you haven't heard what I'm going to say.
See, now we've already talked more than I wanted to.
Well, I did give you my seat, you know.
I think that gets me one question.
Listen, diner guy Shawn.
Shawn.
Flattered, really.
Very often, I am happy to meet new people.
But today, right here, right now, I can't talk.
I understand.
I do.
What if I do the talking for both of us?
Have at it!
Do you mind if I read the paper and stare aimlessly out the window while you two talk?
No.
Can I get a name to work with?
Juliet.
Well, it's very nice to meet you, Juliet.
It's nice to meet you, too, Shawn.
And I am sorry about your seat.
So, lunch is on me.
So, what do you do for a living?
I do a little bit of everything.
Oh, that sounds interesting.
And maybe a little bit dangerous.
Oh, I like your jacket.
I like it Okay, can I stop you here?
First off, in your portrayal of me, I sound like I'm in the eighth grade.
Well, in my portrayal of you, you only have an eighth grade education.
All right, smarten you up.
College, yeah?
Top your class, graduate early Got it.
I'm new to town, and I don't know many people.
But I do know my cats.
Two of them.
The gray one is very affectionate, the white one makes me work much, much harder for the attention.
And what about your family?
My family is amazing!
My parents have been together for, what is it, 30 years now?
Okay, do we know each other?
Yes, you were the girl who stole my seat!
Oh, my gosh, you're a cop!
I'm not a cop!
The paper, the vantage point, the layout, of course!
You got defensive when Scary Guy walked in, you're totally a cop!
Okay, Shawn, I may need you to do me a favor.
Name it.
Duck!
Police!
Gun!
Go!
Let me go!
Get him up!
Come on!
First time pulling your gun?
Maybe.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Thirty seconds, Mr. Guster.
A- G G Let me start over!
"Aggiornamento.
" A G G O Beautiful Santa Barbara, California, is the backdrop for this afternoon's coverage of the American Spelling Bee, being held at the downtown Cabrillo Theater.
Champions from all over these western United States have made the trek to test What are you watching?
Nothing.
Is that Korean porn?
Come on, man!
It's the Regional Finals of the American Spelling Bee.
What?
Don't mock me.
It's a huge event.
No, I'm just I'm shocked that you didn't take the whole day off.
It's on Sports Cal Two, for your information.
And it's hosted by Bud Collins.
Really?
Did they bump the car washing championships for this?
And is it over soon?
'Cause I'd like to get back to the woodcarving finals.
Let's recap this morning's unexpected high drama.
It's being held in Santa Barbara this year.
Down at the Cabrillo.
It's huge.
Sold out.
All the experts are shaking their heads.
I tried to get tickets, but you gotta know somebody.
Somebody lame.
Dude, I can't believe you're watching that!
I'm taping it!
And I don't care what you think, Shawn, I watch the bee semis every year.
Okay, for your sake and mine, stop giving the spelling bee hip little nicknames.
For those of you who have justjoined us, well, a bit of a shock.
And a little sad, too.
The heavy favorite has had a bad spell, and Brendan Vu is out!
What?
Boo-hoo for Vu, Bud.
No way.
Brendan Vu is out?
Already?
Okay, now you're just scaring me.
Come on, Shawn.
He took second last year, everybody knows that!
No, Gus, nobody knows that, except for Brendan and his mother.
Okay.
We're gonna show this again.
It looks like young Mr. Vu may be having trouble breathing.
He does look to be under some sort of duress, Bud.
His inhaler did not appear to help, and Vu tumbled.
Dang!
Paramedics rushed to the scene, and within moments, the competition had taken an unexpected turn.
Wait a second.
Did you see that?
This is no accident.
There's something wrong with that inhaler.
Shawn, get out of here.
For 35 minutes, competition was suspended.
Psych.
and Vu and his family were rushed to the hospital.
It's the Chief.
I'll have to check with Gus.
Are we available?
Appears we are.
We'll be right there.
What?
I can get us into the spelling bee.
Really?
Guess I was right about the whole Bandon Dunes thing.
Brendan Vu.
Sure.
They need a psychic detective for that?
They don't, unless he was sabotaged.
The kid said his inhaler felt funny.
When he used it, his hand stung, paramedics get there, there's no inhaler.
Apparently, the thing just vanished into thin air.
Shawn, we are so taking this!
Let's go!
How come I can't get you this excited about girls?
Let's go, Shawn!
Or Mexico?
We're here!
Go on in, Mr. Spencer.
I've arranged everything you need inside.
You're leaving?
Oh, I was only here for the mayor's presentation, and we have a robbery standoff across town.
Whoa, shouldn't I go to the hospital, meet the victim, get his statement?
Mr. Spencer, the case is sabotage.
There are 43 remaining contestants, all presumably with a motive.
Now, you can read guilt just by talking with someone, right?
Do it.
You want us to talk to all of them?
And their parents.
Today?
Mmm-hmm.
By 5:00.
In two days, this whole thing is over.
At that time, all the witnesses will be in 100 different cities all over the western United States.
So, it's now or never.
Good luck.
Spellmaster Elvin Cavanaugh is a secretive guy, and yet, he has called for a press conference after this round!
Can you repeat that, please?
"Butyraceous.
" Definition, please?
Adjective.
"Having the characteristics of butter.
" This thing's been sold out for weeks.
I can see why.
It moves so fast, it's like hockey with words.
There's Elvin Cavanaugh, the greatest spell champion ever.
He's been the spellmaster for 14 years.
He's a legend.
Wow.
"Butyraceous.
" He sits up there all by himself in that fancy box?
Language of origin?
What is he, the Phantom of the Opera?
He's a huge celebrity!
He can't just sit in the crowd!
Can you repeat the word?
"Butyraceous.
" "Butyraceous"?
Oh, come on, dude, you're not bored at all?
Do you know how to spell any of these words?
Proudly.
I have never heard of any of these words.
I file these words under "Things to say "when I want to be ridiculed or kicked out of bed.
" See, the problem is that butyraceous is clearly a Round One word.
Oh, God, stop talking.
I'd like to pretend we still have things in common, Gus!
Well, instead of sitting here, maybe we should get to work!
Try not to break anything.
Wow!
So this is what it looks like.
What?
The comfort room.
This is where you go to deal with missing a word.
Oh, yeah?
Where do they take you to deal with missing your entire childhood?
Shawn, this misplaced malevolence you have with the spelling bee is getting monotonous.
Stop hating on the bee!
I'm sorry, ma'am, I do apologize for his inappropriate virulence.
Why are you using all these big-ass words all of a sudden?
I'm not doing that.
That's preposterous!
I was in the spelling bee myself.
I almost won.
Dude, are you still on that?
Of course I'm still on it!
I know it wasn't "O"!
You may have five minutes with each contestant, no more.
If the room is needed, you'll be asked to vacate.
I'll begin with the eliminated contestants.
Actually, we'd only like to speak with the ones that were still in the competition when the accident occurred.
Ms. Foote.
And let's start with the shifty-eyed ones, shall we?
And you were there the whole time?
I was.
Assimilation.
A- S-S-I-M-I-L-A-T-I-O-N.
Assimilation.
My son, no one expect him to come this far.
But he surprise everyone.
You watch him win.
Oh, I don't know.
Are they running odds on this thing now?
'Cause I've got some cash I'd like to lay down on the really, really tall girl with the bulldog underbite.
What, is she on stilts?
You do not understand.
This contest, it is money for scholarship.
It is entry into any school in the future.
Yeah, Shawn.
The winner of this competition can just about choose his university.
Your friend is right.
And it teaches grace under pressure.
Poise.
Dignity.
All things you can get at a hot-dog eating competition.
Plus Hot dogs.
Still studying, huh?
Oh, she loves it.
Won't put that thing down.
Well, kudos on the childrearing.
Let me know how the therapy goes.
Huh?
We're gonna keep rolling because of the exceptional request by Elvin Cavanaugh, a behind-the-scenes guy, to give a press conference right here at this stage of the competition!
What's that all about?
Well, I mean, this could be something big, Bud.
I mean, this year's competition has just been peppered with controversy.
It certainly has.
Well, he's been watching from a private box on the balcony, but now, he's going to come out so that we can see him.
This could be something big, Bud.
I think he's having difficulty breathing!
He does look under duress, Bud.
Oh, jeez!
Oh, my!
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Call 911!
Okay, move over.
Okay.
Not to belittle this guy's life, but this just got more interesting than the woodcarving finals.
When do we decide if we should cancel this event?
Why would we cancel?
Well, a body did just tumble into the crowd.
Didn't land on anybody.
It might be traumatic.
For who?
The mayor, when he realizes all the hotel rooms are now empty?
We could postpone at least a day, I'm sure that's allowed.
Do you have any idea how important this event is to the city?
Now, unhealthy guy has heart attack, falls over railing.
Case closed.
Certainly not declaring it a crime scene.
Come on, you can introduce me to the press.
Okay, just be sensitive.
How about if we don't sell the seat the guy landed on?
Can I help you?
Has anyone come out of there?
Just the cops.
I've been here the whole time.
Did you hear anything from in there?
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm Shawn Spencer, I'm a psychic with the police department.
I'm sorry, Mr. Spencer.
Look, I don't doubt your ability, I actually have an aunt who can see apparitions, and some spooky stuff.
But they told me not to let anybody in here without a badge, so I see.
Okay.
As long as you feel safe.
Safe?
What with the dead guy's spirit being here, and him being so angry.
How angry?
Well, considering he might have just been murdered, that's definitely a negative.
Man, I wouldn't be happy!
No, please, spare me!
I'm here to help you!
Gus!
Back me up here!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Segrete ammunus!
You guys just take a quick little look-see, okay?
I'll be downstairs!
Come on, get up!
Well, we certainly know what his vice was.
He was a heavy eater, so what?
Nothing.
I'm just thinking Lassiter's heart attack theory might not be so far off.
Who's Contestant 1953?
It only goes up to 200-something.
What's 1953 mean?
Nothing.
Is it a rule?
No, they don't really number the rules like that.
Think there was an altercation?
No, something else.
He was all by himself up here.
You smell that?
Dude, don't look at me.
It's sulfuric.
Gus, I am not the one who had the egg salad.
No, no, no.
We manufactured something last year, heavy stuff.
When it starts to go bad, smelled the same.
You could pick out a bottle across the warehouse.
I can't smell anything!
Well, you don't have the supersmeller.
Gus!
You have got to stop calling your nose the supersmeller.
You wanna nickname a body part?
Nickname your butt, man!
Call it the "tightbouncer," or the "hexagon.
" Ladies are gonna dig that, I'm telling you.
It's there.
It's right there.
It's subtle, but it's right there.
Well, what is it?
I don't know.
It's nothing we manufacture.
Aren't you supposed to know this kind of stuff?
Shawn, I sell pharmaceutical supplies, I'm not a scientist!
But you're saying it is something?
Yes, I'm pretty sure.
Don't eat it!
What, do I look like an idiot?
What What Are you taking some to go?
Yes!
For the road!
In case later on I get hungry enough to eat something that might be poisoned!
There are four up there, and two on the other side.
What, you mean those two guys up there?
Excuse me, hi, it's time.
The press are ready.
Thank you.
All right.
Man, we gotta go!
Sorry, could I just try that again?
I kind of fumbled the "safe and secure" part.
Sure.
Be sensitive.
Of course.
The finals will continue tomorrow as scheduled.
At this point, all indications are Mr. Cavanaugh was having a heart attack, stumbled forward, falling over the railing to his death.
But we wanna assure everyone that this building is both safe and Our sympathies go out to Mr. Cavanaugh's family, and we would like to offer counseling to anyone who feels that they might need it.
Who's the blonde?
Lassiter's new partner.
They transferred his girlfriend.
And again, we wanna ensure everyone coming out for this fantastic event that it is entirely safe.
Shawn!
They're gonna stop investigating!
One last question, and then I really have to go wrap up this thing.
Do something!
Is there any word as to what Cavanaugh's big announcement was?
Moo goo gai pan!
Beef lo mein, kung pao!
Check the food!
It was murder!
Oh, did I just say all that out loud?
Shawn, you'll never find out what that is without a lab.
I'll get a lab.
A high-tech lab?
Right now?
Maybe.
Might have a connection.
Yo!
Shawn.
Hey, Dad, great shirt!
You want something.
Why do you always think I want something?
Oh, you don't want anything.
What a pleasant surprise.
Okay, you got me!
I want something.
I got a poker game in 45 minutes.
You still talk to Jim Syklan?
Syklan?
Sometimes.
Why, what's he to you?
Is he still working at the regional crime lab out here?
Last I checked.
Why?
I need to know what this is.
It looks like a Number 15 with chicken.
Dad, you made a joke!
I think there's poison in it.
Goodbye, Shawn.
It's just one time!
Once!
No cases, Shawn!
I was painfully clear about that.
Oh, no, no, this isn't for a case.
This is for a friend.
Oh, friend, different.
No!
Look, I'll do anything, whatever you want, it's one favor.
Anything he can tell me about this would be very helpful, it's serious.
Shawn, this is really important to you?
Extremely.
And you'll do anything?
Name it.
Grab a saw.
What, now?
Well, you said you'd do anything, right?
You know, most people will wait five, six whole minutes before they cash in a favor.
I will not saw through bone for you.
The doghouse?
From eighth grade?
Well, it's not really a doghouse.
Not yet.
What do you want me to do?
Finish it.
What, now?
Or whenever you want your information.
You got more wood out back, nails on the workbench, Home Depot's open till 9:00.
Don't cut any corners.
You're insane!
You're losing light.
Make sure you lock up.
It's creepy that you kept this!
Shawn, you've done absolutely nothing to convince me that you're responsible enough for a dog.
You'll never give me a chance.
Chances are earned, Shawn.
You'll never let me earn it!
Fair enough.
You're gonna need a doghouse.
I saw one at the hardware store.
No.
No, no, no.
You're gonna make it.
I can't.
Well, it seems to me that somebody who thinks they're responsible enough for the life of an animal should certainly be able to construct a roof for the ratty little thing.
All right, I'll make it.
I'll make it right now.
What is that?
"What is that"?
It's the doghouse.
No, it's not.
What are you talking about?
I gave you specifications.
When?
When I gave you the job.
In 1989?
Shawn, you know as well as I do this is not what I asked for.
Keep working.
Don't be too loud.
The neighbors are trying to sleep.
You expect me to be okay with this?
I worked hard on it.
Shawn, you've been at this for hours now.
The nails aren't pounded in all the way, the base has gotta be up off the ground.
If it rains, the rain's gonna flow right in.
And who's gonna fit in through that door?
That door's not high enough.
I built it, Dad, what do you want me to do?
I want you to do it right.
Listen, Dr. Sloane, if I can get you this product this afternoon, would it be possible to sit down with you to discuss the M- A The unbelievable results we've been having 0 I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
Thanks.
Burton Guster.
Shawn?
You're in the hospital?
What happened?
You call your dad?
I'm fine.
They're releasing me.
Did you call him?
Gus, I am not gonna talk to my dad.
He'd wanna know you're okay.
All he cares about are results.
Just like those possessed spelling bee parents.
You know what's wrong with this?
All of this.
Shawn, you're delirious.
You're upset.
You lost control of your bike last night.
Gus, I didn't lose control of anything.
Someone tried to kill me or send a very serious message.
Brendan appreciates you checking on him.
Well, we were in the neighborhood.
And, Gus here is a huge fan.
He almost won the spelling bee himself.
I took some bad advice.
Well, Brendan's going home tomorrow.
He's fine.
He's more upset about missing the spelling bee.
Well, maybe they'll decide to redo the whole thing.
Why'd they do that?
Did you see the inhaler?
Same one as that little Czech kid?
Get me a seating chart.
I'll bet you I know who Brendan was sitting next to on day one.
I already checked it out.
Nice!
Shawn, something's going on with that Czech kid.
Talk to me.
The doctor on his inhaler, Dr. Zavin, in Ventura?
Yeah?
He doesn't exist.
I do training on that route.
The last doctor in the book is Youngerman.
I double-checked it today.
You're saying that inhaler Is a fake.
Where you going?
I am going to build a doghouse!
I thought you gave up.
Yeah, well, it doesn't appear so, huh?
What happened to your leg?
Absolutely nothing.
You're running your roofing vertical there, huh?
Yeah.
You might wanna pop a ridge beam in first.
Well, yeah, that's a given.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm gonna help you.
You've never helped me before, ever.
You've never asked.
Put a nail in here.
All right.
This is weird.
No, thanks.
Not bad.
"Not bad"?
It's like the Park Hyatt for poodles.
Will you call Jack Syklan?
What is this?
Your results.
We had an agreement.
This is a derivative of methyl parathion.
High-grade stuff.
Whatever you're into, I want you to get out quick.
I'm not kidding.
Wait a sec.
How did you get this so quickly?
Hmm?
Oh, Syklan's a part of my poker game.
So you didn't even have to call him?
That game was at his house.
And I did all of that for nothing?
For nothing?
Shawn, you've never completed a thing in your life.
Now you have.
Poisoned?
I feel somebody poisoned his food.
There is a Styrofoam container, yes, and a "Happiness is a golden poem.
" What?
A fortune cookie!
This is ridiculous.
Is it?
Mr. Spencer, what we have now points to a medical condition, not murder.
All appearances show Mr. Cavanaugh having an anaphylactic reaction.
Not to be out of line, but that could be triggered by several types of poisons.
Or altered medications.
Or shellfish, which he was allergic to.
Those results will show up in the toxicology report, which we will have a copy of in approximately two weeks.
No, no, no!
That'll be too late.
All the contestants will be gone Home.
You won't be able to finish a real investigation.
Chief, I sense this!
Look, something got out of control and the perpetrator was willing to kill to cover it up!
What proof do you have?
Only what I feel.
Why are you still listening to this crap?
Dude, what is your glitch?
You!
You're my glitch!
Look, he got nowhere with his little inhaler assignment, and then he tells the media that we had a murder scene!
Cut him loose, Karen!
I mean, do whatever you think is best, Chief.
Mr. Cavanaugh was gonna make an announcement.
What about that?
The Director said he'd recently spoken of retiring.
That's not what he was gonna say.
Oh, you know?
I know.
Mr. Spencer, I asked you to check in about the inhaler incident.
If you or your partner have anything about that, I'd be happy to hear about it.
Otherwise We gotta get back into the spellmaster's room.
Are you serious?
Gus, the killer was there!
There's gotta be some other piece of evidence inside.
We're not gonna have time to get in there.
Besides, it's locked.
We'll make it work.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How hard is it to get into this event without a ticket?
Impossible.
The new spellmaster.
Check it out.
It's exactly what I was hoping you'd say.
You can't do that to him!
Gus, he has to learn sometime that smoking is bad for him.
We're picking it up as a new round commences.
A lot of excitement in the air.
Ooh, yeah.
The tension is becoming butyraceous, Bud.
I'm so sorry if my agonizing pain is inconveniencing you.
What's this?
It's a mark on a carpet.
Let's go.
Someone must have heard that.
Thirty seconds.
Live to air.
Positions, please.
Time's up, Shawn.
Did you hear me, Shawn?
I've got something!
Yes!
Ten seconds.
Prepare the next word.
That can't be right.
It doesn't mean anything, Shawn, let's go.
Broadcast in five, four, three, two Maybe this direction.
Hello?
We need the word now.
Is everything okay?
Leann, something's wrong, send security.
No, sorry for the delay.
Give me a word!
A word?
Yeah!
Something hard, but something you can spell.
I can spell anything.
Except "aggiornamento.
" Give me one!
No!
You are not gonna be spellmaster!
Gus, give me a word so we can get out of here!
We're so close!
Is everything okay up there?
It's fine.
"Banana.
" Can you repeat that?
Yes.
"Banana.
" "Banana," Shawn?
This is the third round!
You could have helped me!
This is a dead end, Shawn, we're walking.
Let's go!
Definition, please?
What?
A yellow fruit.
Also, a kind of pudding.
A delicious pudding.
Sentence, please?
"Anna Banana would like to hearVenus by Bananarama.
" "Banana.
" B- A-N-A-N-A.
Banana.
Oh, wait a second, I've got something!
Dude, we got him!
He was watching the Czech.
Let me see.
We need to get the next word.
Give me a word.
No!
You're ruining the whole event!
Suit yourself.
"Onion.
" "Onion"?
"Onion"?
Even Dan Quayle could spell that.
O- N-I-O-N.
Onion.
Are we off the list, Bill?
No, everything's fine.
You're using his grocery list!
You refused to help me!
Now I gotta give them something else.
"Mitchum.
" "Mitchum"?
Yes.
"When I go to Albertsons, I need to buy some Mitchum Ice Blast.
" "And bananas.
" That wasn't me!
I was locked outside.
I have a reputation to uphold!
So he was watching the Czech, we have no proof.
There was no film in the camera!
He was using that lens for something else besides taking pictures.
Now, what?
Cavanaugh was known for ferreting out rule breakers.
He once caught a kid stealing the advance word list.
And everything he did had a purpose.
You couldn't have grabbed one of these five minute ago?
We're down to the final two spellers.
This has been a hard-fought battle right from the start!
We've had tragedy, controversy, but when it really mattered, these kids put together a fantastic display of the power of learning.
Look at this.
Brendan Vu went down on "gladiolus.
" So?
So?
If I'd been able to see any of the competition, I could have told you that was the winning word from the first spelling bee in 1929.
Okay, you're scaring me again.
All of these words from that round were the winning words.
They do that once in a while, they make it a theme round.
This one won the 1985 bee, this one from 1943.
Gus, what are you saying?
Guess which kid got the winning word from 1953?
You're staring at his father.
Gus, that's who Cavanaugh was gonna disqualify.
That's what he was tracking in the rulebook!
Jiri Prochazka, you have the next word.
"Mastoparietal.
" Part of speech?
It is an adjective.
Could I have the definition?
Yes.
"Relating to the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, "and to the parietal lobe.
" M A-S-T O-P-A-R-I I got him.
Let's call the Chief.
And this year's winner of the Central California Regionals is Jiri Prochazka!
Move out, people, this is what you came to see, right here.
This is it!
Yes!
This competition meant everything to Miklous!
Oh, boy!
Gus!
Gus, here we go!
Gus, it's happening!
I know who killed Elvin Cavanaugh.
Can't he ever just tell us to arrest someone?
He does this a lot?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I'm kind of a slave to my visions.
I'm a slave.
Do you want me to cuff him?
Why would I want that?
Just a suggestion.
They just sort of come when they wanna come, and Jiri.
Spell "soubrette.
" Why is this man speaking?
You can't, can you?
Not without help from your dad.
And that's not a real inhaler, is it?
This is crazy, this This Cheating was Cavanaugh's obsession.
He was gonna expose you as a cheater.
He was gonna disqualify Jiri, and you knew it, and you couldn't let that happen.
You had way too much to lose.
You slipped into the box.
You knew his comfort was food!
He was dangerously unhealthy!
He's starting to go into shock.
You knew he wouldn't stop the bee!
He never stops the bee!
By the end of the round, it was too late!
Too dizzy to walk, he stumbles He tumbles over the rail, crashes onto the chairs below.
And there goes the evidence.
Except for one thing.
That inhaler.
It sends electronic signals!
The transmitter is in your jacket.
You sent the signals from the audience to the stage.
And I bet at your home, we'll find the van that ran me off the road when I alerted the police!
Dangerous cocktail, unforgiving poisons.
You don't need it.
I took your advice.
I ran the Chinese food through the lab, nothing's definite.
I'm sorry.
He just seemed sure.
I took a shot.
I'll take it from here.
I could've won that thing.
Yeah, you could've.
Thank the Lord you didn't.
What is that supposed to mean?
Oh, Gus.
The guy who wins?
Saddled forever as, you know, the dude that won the spelling bee.
I'm sure you would've dealt with it later, but kids, high school kids, especially, they're just ruthless, judgmental.
Horrible little bastards.
You wouldn't have been able to date a cheerleader.
They wouldn't have invited you to any parties.
You'd have been the object of ridicule.
I mean, this way, you got to be a smart kid and a cool kid.
Best of both worlds.
That's true.
I appreciate that, Shawn.
Yeah, it's a nice balance.
That's why I had to give you the wrong letter.
You knew that was wrong?
Oh, come on, Gus.
"Aggiornamento"?
Everybody knew it was an "I".
All right, you hold on.
You were happy one second ago.
I was about to win!
I studied for three months.
Yeah, and you would have kept studying forever and ever!
All the way till Nationals!
But you're upset now, I can see that.
But you'll be fine with it later.
You know what that did to me?
Yes, yes, I do.
We went out the next night, and you were so flustered that you threw caution to the wind, and you hooked up with Melinda Castleberg!
It was nice!
Come here, Shawn!
At least I was honest.
Come here!
Ah, Shawn, what a coincidence.
Yeah, I was just reading the newspaper, a little article that sounded very familiar about a spelling bee.
Thanks for the help, Dad.
Police ever get that evidence?
Yeah, a funny little bird tipped them off.
Leg doing better?
It's getting there, doesn't hurt so bad.
Listen, Dad, the thing about the house, the dog, it was kind of a big deal.
And I know I held a grudge about it for a while.
But I think you were right.
A dog needs a house, and a doghouse needs an occupant, so as a token of my appreciation, I left you a little something.
Sincerely, thanks.
Shawn.
Shawn!
No.
No way!
Enjoy, Dad.
Shawn, you gotta take this thing with you!
You kidding?
There's no pets allowed in my apartment!
I'm gonna stick it on the street, Shawn!
I swear I'm gonna stick Shawn!
Shawn!
He's not gonna keep that thing, you know.
It's my neighbor's dog.
Shawn!
Take a lap around the block.
Let him stew a little bit.
I'm gonna take it, and I'm gonna go, and I'm gonna stick it on the street!
Shawn!
Shawn!
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hey, Shawn, what in the world do you think you're doing?
Hide and seek.
I don't think so.
But you said we could.
Not like that.
That's how you play.
Not in my house.
Shawn, you can't tail a suspect like that.
Look how loud you are.
Your perp is gonna hear you coming from every turn.
Those things smack every time you take a step.
Now, if you're gonna wear them when you compete, you gotta keep Compete?
On the balls of your feet.
Balls of your feet.
And you take deliberate steps.
You don't know where he is.
He shouldn't get to know where you are.
He's invisible, you're invisible.
Now, you've leveled the playing field.
Can I go now?
No.
You're going to learn to do the little things right.
For instance, when you peer around a corner, I want you to stay down low 'cause, you see, they're expecting you up here at eye level.
When you walk down a hall, check the grains of the carpet.
We just vacuumed, right?
And never, ever again do I ever want to hear you slam a door when you can pull it closed.
But we're just playing.
Well, play right, Shawn, or don't play at all.
Shawn, he's not in here.
I don't need to tell you how vital it is that we maintain the utmost secrecy on this heist.
The Attorney General does not want his son's wedding disrupted any more than it's already been.
How will we explain our presence to the press?
We don't.
Just let them stew.
Well, that's one approach.
But, if I may suggest, I once wrote a paper regarding press releases and such and Sorry, your idea sounds great.
Get the board.
What are you doing?
Dude, I'm onto something big.
Tailing cops?
In a police station?
Some monumentally expensive ring just got stolen.
I'm gonna get us on the case.
We just got a case five minutes ago.
Yeah, a lame one.
Stolen computers from a high school.
Come on, like, you were falling asleep during that meeting.
This is an heirloom.
It's worth $5 million, lifted from the hotel where they're having the wedding.
Wedding's on Saturday.
There's an open bar.
Dude, we're so there.
Are we looking at the same thing?
I told you to wait in my office.
I had a premonition.
Something sparkly.
Just over five karats, perfect clarity, slight inclusion.
Is this ringing any bells for you?
Solve the case I gave you.
Then we'll talk.
In the meantime, I have a lot of work to complete.
It's the secretary.
Pardon?
The secretary.
The secretary did it.
Now, what can you tell me about the ring I'm envisioning?
But you barely even looked at this folder.
It's in the papers.
Where?
The signatures, it's in her handwriting.
Look, she's faking her own signature, and later there's evidence that it's I feel it in the ink.
Very bad vibes.
Strong squidish vibes.
We'll check it out.
Until then, I trust you can find the door.
But what about the ring?
Not until this one is done.
Hey, let me gather some information, all right?
Make a little headway.
Then I'll have a psychic episode that blows the ears right off their skulls.
Shawn, I'm in meetings all day.
I barely had time to come down for this.
We're doing what the Chief says.
Period.
So sorry to have kept you waiting.
I am Shawn Spencer, chief psychic here at the department.
Thank you so much for helping.
This whole thing has been devastating.
My hands are still shaking.
You're doing fine.
Okay, I only have a second.
I'll need you to tell me everything I have to know about this case as quickly as humanly possible, okay?
What about this guy?
What's going on with the best man?
I don't know, he's not answering his phone or his door.
This day has just been completely unreal.
Guys, it's going to be fine.
You're in good hands.
I have never failed a case.
I know who you are.
I read about you in the paper.
You did?
You're the sister of the groom.
And the maid of honor.
And the wedding planner?
Correct.
That is so many hats.
You should see my closet.
I am hoping to.
But not until I find this ring.
Well, the wedding's tomorrow.
How fast are you?
That depends entirely on how much cooperation I receive.
Why don't you come to the wedding?
Yeah.
No, no, I couldn't possibly impose on you.
No.
Please, you're saving us here.
You find this ring, we'd owe you everything.
What in the hell is going on here?
I just dropped by to say hello.
Guys, this is head detective Carlton Lassiter and his lovely new partner, Juliet.
His last one turned out to be his girlfriend, so she was transferred.
I'm not sure if that was the only reason.
I'll let you decide for yourselves.
Shall we?
Sure.
If this is some sort of hazing ritual, where we're gonna end up naked in a river somewhere, I'll need to arrange for a ride home.
Listen to me, Spencer.
The department's reputation is on the line with this one.
If I catch you anywhere near this case, I will throw every book I can find at you.
What if you find the Bible?
You going to throw that, too?
Seems a little sacrilegious to me, don't you think?
Ow.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Burton Guster, Central Coast Pharmaceuticals.
Dude, I got a suspect I'll call you back later, Shawn.
No, no, you can't.
I left my cell phone in your car yesterday, along with a tuna sandwich.
I seriously hope you found that.
Later this afternoon, Shawn.
No, no, Gus, this happens now.
The wedding is tomorrow.
Is he coming?
Not yet.
But we're getting closer.
Thanks, Stabber.
Mandatory briefing.
Magnolia room.
15 minutes.
Excuse us, please.
Attorney General Maxwell.
Detective, I trust we're making progress.
I am right on schedule, sir.
I've booked myself a suite to use as a command center.
Why?
I'll stay the night if I have to.
Keep an eye on things.
The city's not paying for that, is it?
No?
That ring has been in my family for 200 years.
My mother agonized over the decision to give it to my son.
I'm not letting it get away now.
Sir, we are checking every person who came through that door.
Every employee.
Every guest.
Nobody checks out of this hotel until we're just short of going through every piece of their luggage.
Way ahead of you, sir.
No, you're not.
What?
Can I help you, sir?
I'm just listening.
For what?
For what?
Lyme disease.
Lyme disease?
Lyme disease, rickets, avitaminosis, Legionnaire's, bubonic.
You name it.
I want you to listen to something.
Do you hear that?
Mmm-hmm.
We have spores in the wall.
Spores?
You know where else they are?
In the planter.
You know where else?
Everywhere in the entire hotel.
Who called you?
Mike?
Mike?
Is this a big joke to you?
I don't answer to Mike.
Have you seen Mike lately?
Mike can kiss my ass.
I was called in by the state inspector himself.
Are you at all aware how dangerous this is?
Hell, yes, I am!
Good.
I'm glad.
I need access to this whole place, elevator shafts, air vents, the safe room, obviously.
The safe room is a crime scene.
This eucalyptus will be dead by lunch.
The safe room will be a triage unit if I don't get those spores out of there.
Understood.
Can we let the cops finish up in there first?
Tell them to hurry.
Oh, man.
Thirteen minutes after midnight, members of the wedding party enter the safe room, placing the ring into a safety deposit box, which was slid into the safe and closed for the night.
No sensors indicate that either the safe door or the lock box was opened again until the following morning.
Please note, he has activated the time lock, which prevents the safe from opening.
No one walks into that room again until the following morning, when the ring is discovered missing.
So it definitely didn't disappear during the night?
Or so they would like you to think.
However, ifyou look closely, there are nine glitches on this tape.
I'm sorry, glitches?
Seams, static bursts in the image.
Someone could have tapped in an alternate video feed of this room while it was empty.
Or, more likely, as I believe, someone built a scale replica of this room.
Who laughed?
Nobody?
If somebody disagrees with my theory, I'd like to know.
It does seem very elaborate.
And just a bit far-fetched.
Are you a detective?
Why are you here?
You asked for all of us to come.
Oh, well, Officer, since you're such an expert on fetching, why don't you fetch me a cup of coffee?
Moving on.
All the employee alibis check out.
Except this one.
Dietrich Mannheim.
Currently the facilities manager.
You may remember him from the security video.
He was in the room when the ring was placed into the safety deposit box.
During questioning, he was nervous, evasive, and contradicted himself more than once.
His work computer history reveals that he recently visited websites for boats and expensive cars, and he failed to show up for work.
Questions?
Is this your only lead?
His responses to my interrogation were hostile at best.
Clarify "hostile".
Use my tone now as a guide.
Detective O'Hara, all alone?
Well, not anymore, apparently.
Work troubles?
I'm sensing work troubles.
Here, let me read your palm.
How about just one finger?
Come, now, let me see if I can be helpful.
Why are you here?
The Maxwell wedding.
Honestly.
I was invited.
By whom?
Beth.
Bethany.
The bride.
Little baby B. The B sting.
Love her.
God, Dylan is so lucky to have her.
She grounds him in ways that he needed grounding, don't you think?
She's a good sport.
Air Supply, really?
Kidding.
Just kidding.
Relax.
This is work-related.
You thought this place would be different, but nobody respects your opinions.
They all think you're too young?
Always.
You know, I think you and I could help each other.
And how would that be?
Oh, I know things.
Things about rings.
Oh.
I thought you were here for a wedding.
I am ish.
You first.
I just got a message for you, Mr. Guster, and, well, I'm afraid it's about your cat.
My cat?
The poor thing is in the animal hospital.
They think her leg is broken.
I'll get down there later.
You're not going?
I'm very busy.
But your cat needs you for moral support.
The vet said it could be the difference.
Later.
You have to go.
Mr. Guster, I know that you're in shock.
Don't do anything you're going to regret forever.
I don't even He's not going?
Oh.
So, now I have a cat?
An orange tabby.
Last Christmas, you made her a tiny Santa hat.
It was adorable.
Fantastic.
I can't even have a make-believe boy cat.
Gus, a boy cat wouldn't serve my purposes nearly as well.
The next time I need you, Pickles is having kittens.
Pickles?
Mrs. Pickles is her full name.
Though, I'm not actually sure cats can marry outside of Boston.
Yeah, well, in a related issue, I'm blocking your number on all the phones in the office.
If you think that will work, I think it's endearing.
In the meantime, aren't you the least bit curious about who was there when they put the ring in the hotel safe?
Wait a minute.
This is a safecracking case?
Did I forget to mention that?
What kind of safe?
The Hydra 700.
The 700 is out?
That's impossible, nobody could crack that.
I haven't even told you about the wall sensors.
Can we be done by 3:00?
Yes.
The safe room, right behind that door.
What is all this?
I thought this was a safe job.
Oh, Lassiter has this insane idea that this in an elaborate heist, right?
Like on par with Ocean's Eleven, or Thomas Crown, or Oh, the one where they kill Donald Sutherland in the first ten minutes, remake Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster, what a surprise.
Chief.
Looking good.
You're probably wondering I sent an officer down to the high school to take a look at your secretary suspect.
She cracked.
He didn't even get the first question out.
Really?
'Cause I envisioned that being harder.
Yet I don't recall asking you to come down here to the De La Cruz.
Well, we have reason to believe this case goes in a completely different direction.
Huh.
Let me be perfectly clear.
I didn't see you and we didn't talk.
Call me if you have something.
I love her.
Yeah.
He knows you?
I had to lay some groundwork.
He doesn't believe in psychics.
This is plan B. Chief Inspector Shawn, how are you?
I'm undercover.
Not even the American police know I'm in on this.
I'm sorry.
I blew it again, didn't I?
And after you brought me into your confidence.
Bobby, it's fine.
Believe me.
These other Interpol guys are very appreciative of what you're doing here.
How long will you need?
Just as discussed, five minutes, tops.
You're my man.
Interpol?
That's right.
Missing Ring Division.
I believe I was recruited out of North Africa when I was 15.
You could at least use a British accent.
Oh, please, Gus, I started with a British accent, and then seamlessly slipped into my fake American one.
Bobby gave me some pointers.
Apparently you Americans say "howdy" a lot.
Howdy.
What are you doing?
List.
List.
I made a list of suspects after attending Lassiter's briefing.
He let you in his briefing?
He does when you're in the airshaft.
All your suspects are in the wedding party?
Look, the only ones who knew they put that ring in the safe were at the rehearsal dinner.
So, it was an inside job?
Looking like it.
You're making keys?
Gus, how else do you expect me to get in the rooms?
Shawn, you can't do that.
Of course I can, I worked at the Hampton Inn for that three-day weekend in Austin when we were 19.
I know you remember that.
Gus, this is so easy.
Try making a key.
Dude, I rule.
Nope.
Innocent.
Let's move.
What are you talking about?
We haven't even stepped foot in there.
Gus, do you need the remedial course, really?
Uncle Leo left his wallet on the table.
Criminals are sneaky, jaded, suspicious people.
They're smart and defensive.
This guy has a reason to be trusting.
Can we go now?
Shawn?
Guys, hey, your door was open.
Oh, it was?
Yes, and I was worried that something horrible had happened.
You're okay?
Yeah, yeah.
I told you we didn't have to come in here.
They're fine.
Everybody's fine.
This is my associate, Gus.
Just call him Peter Panic.
How are you doing?
So, you're a psychic, too?
Well Gus here is a safe expert.
Yes, he subscribes to The Safecracker, a safecracking comic book.
It's an online magazine.
And it's a trade publication.
Excuse me for saying so, but how exactly do you figure into this legal family?
I started my criminal law degree.
Then I came to my senses, went to Europe, painted, slept, ate, sank a boat.
Disappointed?
Besotted.
We'd like to speak to the best man, if possible.
So would we.
Any ideas where he is?
We haven't seen him since the night of the sixth.
Which is the night the ring disappeared.
The florist quit.
So, after we dropped the ring off at the safe, we had to wrap bouquets all night in our suite.
Everybody except Jack.
Do you think he's a suspect?
No, we just think he's lazy.
Hey, Dad, this is Shawn Spencer.
He's the psychic I told you about.
I know.
Let's talk.
Son, I'm very comfortable with the current direction of the investigation.
So, let's let the real police department do their job.
Sir, believe me, I am only here to help.
In fact, I was actually hoping to discuss I'm glad you understand.
The guy shook my hand like I stole something.
You see?
That's why I can't do this job alone.
Wow.
That is about as orange as you can get.
Which suspect's room is this?
Lassiter's.
The head detective?
He has his own room?
Perhaps paid for by the city.
No.
No.
This is going too far.
We're not staying.
Gus, we need these witness statements.
It's not exactly like we're being overwhelmed with cooperation here.
Oh, Lacey.
Lacey, you can sink my boat.
Toss me the remote.
It's the bottom of the eighth inning and so far it's been What do you got?
You got anything good?
I hate to say it, but yeah.
The Attorney General has an insurance policy on the ring.
He'll collect a cool $3 million on it as long as it still belongs to him, which it does only until these two are married.
Well, well, well.
I'm supposed to knock.
Forgive me, Detective.
Detective?
Head Detective.
Sorry.
I was told you wouldn't be here until 6:00 tonight.
That's right.
6:00 tonight.
Head Detective.
I changed my plan.
Please don't tell anyone.
Absolutely, sir.
Thanks.
6:00, huh?
Is there anything I can do for you while I'm here?
As a matter of fact, yes, there is.
We'd like a room service menu delivered immediately.
In Lassiter's photo, there didn't appear to be a mark on that safe.
I don't care how good you are, you don't crack a Hydra without leaving some sort of visible residue.
We need to see that safe.
That's going to be a little difficult.
How close you need to be?
Is there a secret back door through the kitchen?
No, we're gonna take the air vents.
Unfortunately, both my access points are blocked by Santa Barbara's finest.
You think I'm going in there?
You know you want to.
Not in this suit.
Gus, do you wanna see the safe or not?
Look, this will be easy.
We take this dumbwaiter up to the grate, pop the screen, crawl right through the shafts.
Three rights and a left.
We check our progress through the vents.
Isn't it kind of weird how the body's just shoved in here?
No, what's weird is there's a dead guy in a dumbwaiter and we're standing here staring at it, waiting for somebody to find us.
Let's go!
This is Lassiter's suspect.
Shawn, close the hatch and keep your voice down.
I don't want to explain how we got here.
I just need to see one thing.
You answered it.
Hello?
Three days, Shawn.
Dad, hey, gonna have to call you back.
No, no.
You were supposed to call me yesterday.
You were supposed to call me the day before.
We need to handle this now.
Dad, I'm a little busy right now.
Shawn, just tell me when you are going to come by and pick up the box of trophies?
Really tough to be sure.
Last week you were all gung-ho about getting this stuff back.
I went upstairs, I brought it down for you, it's sitting in the middle of my kitchen table.
I need my kitchen table, Shawn.
You're right.
Can I please call you back, Dad?
How about you just give me an answer?
Tonight.
No.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow, wonderful.
Otherwise, I am putting it outside, and that's where it's sitting.
Now how hard was that?
So easy.
Anything else?
No, unless, of course, you need something.
Nope.
I'm good.
Well, actually, wait, I do have one question.
Go ahead.
How long does it take before a dead body starts to smell bad?
Oh, God.
Did you wipe our fingerprints off?
Of course I did.
We were never there.
We need to call the Chief soon.
If Dietrich was a part of this, he's not anymore.
Why is it the Attorney General has to call me wondering why some civilian is wandering around grilling his entire family?
Wait a second.
The Attorney General has your number?
What are you guys, tight?
Give it up.
What's the story?
He also told me to keep you out of here by any means necessary, which opens up an entire world of exciting possibilities for me, personally.
Ow!
Gosh!
Gosh!
Oh, it's too much!
It's too much!
You're not going to shoot him, are you?
I haven't decided.
Oh, my ear.
Gus, my ear.
Oh, for the love of Mike, you are not gonna escape.
Would you just give it up?
Give it up!
Check the dumbwaiter.
Open the dumbwaiter.
Detective O'Hara!
Oh, my God!
Lassiter.
Lassiter.
Lassy Get over here!
Let's go.
Get him in the van.
Come on.
You two, out.
No.
Don't we get to wait around for the autopsy?
No, we'll call you if we need you.
Detective.
Sir?
Shut this down.
Keep it quiet.
Nobody in the wedding party is to know about this.
They've been through enough.
Yes, sir.
So, this is it.
Well, that ought to keep them busy for a while.
Can we at least watch the tape in another room besides Lassiter's?
Gus, he's not coming back.
Are you sure about that?
Yes, didn't you check his messages?
Are you gonna have some cookies?
No.
Do you wanna finish my banana?
I want to leave.
Look at the best man.
He's smashed.
And look at his hair.
It's horrible.
That's it?
We have to watch it again.
It's open.
It's open?
What are you doing?
Oh, what am I early?
Big Dyl, you're right on time.
Did I forget to mention that we're hosting the bachelor party?
No, thank you.
He says, "Uh-oh.
I thought you said you wanted it inside the piòata.
" Eat.
Eat like men.
You're really mad?
We have less than 12 hours to solve the case, and you're throwing a kegger in a police officer's room.
Why would I be mad?
Gus, his best man was a total washout, he wasn't gonna plan anything.
We have to dig information out of suspects, and you're wasting time.
Dylan!
Dude.
You, wow!
Yes, wow!
Gus here has some questions for you, you flaxen-haired Argonaut.
Anything for you two.
I love you guys.
I've found that they're particularly forthcoming with information while in this state.
For example, I've eliminated every suspect here.
Although there is a guy stealing cable and another refilling his minibar bottles with shampoo, but I don't think those are gateway crimes to a jewelry heist.
Seriously.
Gus, come on, give me a kiss.
No, no, nothing weird, on my cheek.
Get me out of here.
I think it's your turn to dig.
Do you know who stole the ring?
No.
And to be honest, I don't care.
I didn't even want the damn thing.
Okay.
The night that we announced our engagement, no, my Dad stops dinner right in the middle of my speech.
So, he goes and gets my grandmother's ring.
What am I supposed to say?
No?
So, now it's not about us, it's about him again.
I mean, forget that I just chose the person that I wanna spend the rest of my life with.
I don't wanna seem ungrateful, but if it were up to me, I'd sooner just stop looking.
Cross him off.
Dylan, how is Dad?
I mean, financially, would you say everything is Okay.
So much for that.
Dylan was the only shot we had in this room, but that's okay.
We have other suspects in this hotel.
At least take a traveler.
Sweet nectar.
Yeah.
All right.
Crazy running into you guys here.
What are the odds?
You got anything?
These girls are not criminals.
It was worth a shot.
You wanna get out of here?
Yes, I do.
So, how are you holding up?
I'm good.
My dad brought in all this extra security for some reason.
Can he afford that?
What do you mean?
I don't know, it's just It was a tough year financially for a lot of people What are you getting at?
I'm just making random conversation.
Here's my bouquet.
Oh, it's fantastic.
Well, it's sub-par.
I was rushed.
All that craziness.
I wish I could fix it.
Well, let's just take it out.
It's locked.
They lock up flowers?
I bet you could open it.
You have good hands.
Shawn!
Excuse me.
You left me there!
Yes, I did.
And you're very welcome.
I just got a lap dance from Patrick Swayze!
What do you mean?
Like an impersonator?
No, I think it was actually Patrick Swayze.
I'm going home.
We're done.
All we've done is eliminate suspects.
We're back where we started.
Oh, Gus, we're fine.
We've got the whole wedding ceremony tomorrow to solve the case.
Oh, oh, okay.
So, we can do what an entire police force can't in two hours?
Hmm.
Okay, you're right.
We should totally get there half an hour early.
You are the most beautiful bride in this room.
Oh, thank you.
Does anyone need help?
The bouquets still aren't here.
We might as well not even have the ceremony.
Okay, you, relax.
Breathe.
Think happy thoughts like puffy clouds, mac and cheese, Lou Diamond Phillips.
Look, it worked.
What are you doing?
Helping.
No, those bouquets are very specific.
They look identical, ma'am.
It's my wedding, shouldn't I be the one freaking out?
Oh, there'll be plenty of time for that later.
Where is it?
Where?
Where's my bouquet?
She's really a very nice person under normal circumstances.
Lace?
Everything okay up here?
You all right?
Yeah.
Sorry.
I think I'm having sympathy Bridezilla.
I'm good now.
Great.
Emma doesn't wanna wear the flower in her hair.
But these are magic flowers.
Do you want one now?
I don't know what to tell you, sir, but these are the charges.
$1,600 for a junior suite?
With a queen bed?
Well, the room was a small portion.
However, it's all your room charges that drove up your bill.
I was hardly even in the room!
I'm sorry, Detective Lassiter, but that's what it says here.
This isn't Detective Lassiter.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, he's a shorter guy.
Brown hair.
Suede jacket.
Helped him fill the Jacuzzi with champagne last night.
Really?
If I brought this man here, could you identify him?
Oh, absolutely.
In fact, I can tell you where he is.
He's over at the Maxwell wedding.
The chapel is just outside the east lawn.
I'll be right back.
"I, Dylan, take you Bethany.
" I, Dylan, take you Bethany.
"To be my wife.
" To be my wife.
MINlSTER: "Confidant of my heart.
" Confidant of my heart.
"That you will be a faithful friend.
" That you will be a faithful friend.
"And a true and loving companion.
" And a true and loving companion.
"I give to you my sacred vow.
" Excuse me.
I give to you my sacred vow.
I think we should wait until the ceremony's over.
Fine.
Nice suit.
Where'd you get that from?
Gus, don't underestimate me, or my wardrobe.
You might want to remove Don't pull that off!
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Just slide it They're here for you.
Not if I solve this case first.
Good plan.
You got about five minutes.
I already know who did it.
No, you don't.
How is that possible?
Between all that, when you said your girlfriend just had an aneurysm because she got the wrong bouquet, you had time to put all that out of your mind and solve the case?
Gus.
What?
And now for a moment of silence.
Gus, I seriously do have a guess.
Probability of being right?
I don't know, high sixties.
Close your mouth.
But the person's in the room.
The thief could potentially escape.
Shouldn't I stop the wedding?
No.
Under no circumstances are you allowed to stop this wedding.
If there's any reason why these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.
I have something.
It's not necessarily marriage-related.
I hope that's not a problem.
Sir, please.
I know who stole the ring.
You cannot do this, Shawn.
This wedding has taken over a year to plan.
What are you doing?
Radioing the Chief.
I can see it.
ChiefVick?
I can feel it.
I can now feel the ring.
It's in this room.
It's in the room.
It's in this room.
They wouldn't bring a stolen ring to the ceremony, you moron.
They would if they couldn't get to it till today.
Lacey, I'm so sorry.
And believe me when I say, I really, really, really wish it wasn't you.
Me?
Are you crazy?
I'm the one who's done all the work.
Yes, you are.
And we're all very impressed, but it was also an excellent cover, wasn't it?
You are crazy, Shawn.
And, by the way, we're officially off for next Friday.
Oh, boy!
I can see it now.
You're at the dinner table.
They're announcing the engagement.
You're thrilled, of course.
You and Bethany have been best friends forever.
Dad Dad has a surprise for the happy couple.
What could it be?
Wait a minute.
You didn't know the ring was going to Dylan.
You were always your grandmother's favorite and you're the oldest girl.
That ring should be yours, right?
Right.
You were counting on that ring.
It was your future.
Oh!
Sorry.
I can see you plotting.
I can see you plotting right there at the dinner table.
But Dad Dad throws a curve ball.
No, it was a slider.
He's overly cautious because sometimes engagements end.
Not you guys.
It's okay.
They're not letting go of the ring until the wedding, which means you have a very small window within which to grab it.
Does all this have anything to do with why these two shouldn't be married?
No, sir.
No.
It doesn't at all, actually.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
Of course, you insisted it be used during the rehearsal so then you had your chance.
While everyone else was fawning over the ring, you made one final adjustment.
It looked like you just straightened it out and put it right back, but you never did, did you?
No, Lacey, because you have magic hands, which I was really looking forward to on Friday.
Everyone was fooled.
Everyone was fooled, except Dietrich Mannheim, who hadn't yet discovered how to use this information to his benefit.
This is first-rate fiction, Shawn.
Unfortunately, there's no evidence.
There would have been no evidence if you could have gotten away that night.
But there was a problem.
Yes, you were called away.
The florist.
The florist bailed on you.
The bouquets.
You got a last minute batch of materials, and the bouquets would now have to be crafted by hand.
There was no other time but now.
You looked for a way out, but there was none.
You had a $5 million ring that was about to be discovered missing any minute, hidden in your palm, and you were gonna have to pull an all-nighter in a room with eight other people.
You thought you could get back into the cooler later and grab it, but they kept their flowers locked up.
So, you had to have your specific bouquet, or else.
Lacey, you're not an unreasonable person.
You're just a thief.
Or at least you were a thief, until Dietrich Mannheim called and told you that he was on to you.
He wanted a piece of that action, too.
Or he was going to the police.
You tried to talk him down, but he got rough.
It got ugly.
It was all spinning out of control.
Eventually, they were going to find that body, so you started laying out clues.
You sent the police off in all directions because you'd grown up hearing all about crime scenes.
I would say that's fortuitous, because you knew just what to leave, didn't you?
I have worked 18 hours a day on this wedding.
I have sacrificed my weekends.
I will not be treated this way.
Then show us your bouquet, Lacey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
She's running?
In those heels, really?
We have to chase her, too?
But we have no evidence except for that ring!
Dude, you're next.
Come on.
You're still angry, even after I solved your crime?
Is this the man?
No.
This guy was not in my room?
I've never seen him before.
You got a room?
Why?
We should have a party.
Get out of my sight.
Thank you, Bobby.
Interpol appreciates both of your efforts.
I love weddings.
Don't you?
I didn't exactly think it was appropriate for you to give the toast.
Well, the best man was unprepared.
Someone had to step in.
Besides, it was like a practice run for your wedding.
You are not gonna be my best man.
You bet your ass I am.
I've already picked out which song I'm singing at the altar.
Really?
You still like Ted Nugent?
Remind me to show you your vows.
They're going to make you cry.
Gus.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?

{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
How long do we have to wait?
Until we catch our bad guy.
Can I sleep?
You can't sleep on a stakeout, Shawn.
You can eat.
You can chew gum.
But you can't drink because if you drink, you're gonna have to pee.
And the target always comes out right when you got to pee.
Now I think I gotta pee.
Well, then, Shawn, your bladder is going to get some training tonight, too.
We've got action.
Now, I want you to stay down.
I know, I know, I know.
Go!
Go!
Come on.
I got you.
I got you red-handed, you lying son of a bitch.
"I don't know what happening to your newspaper, Henry.
" You're transparent, Clark.
You didn't think I could nab a liar like you?
I can explain!
Tell it to the Neighborhood Watch Association.
Give the paper to the boy, Clark.
What the hell are you doing?
Checking baseball scores.
My fantasy team is killing me.
This is the Chief's office!
I know, she runs the league.
I'm kidding.
She's in a meeting.
She won't mind.
Plus, we look really important hanging out in here.
Gus, have you tried this chair?
It's a pregnancy chair.
We have gotta get one for the office immediately.
My birthing canal has never felt so in line.
We need to get out of here.
She told me to wait.
For what?
Gus, I'm not a mind reader.
No, that's just what you tell everybody.
I want you to try this chair.
I'm not trying that chair, Shawn.
I'll sit on the birthing ball.
I kid you not, that thing is like a refreshing waterfall cascading down your vertebrae.
It might help with your stomach issues.
Who told you I had stomach issues?
My nose?
The vent in the bathroom?
Air fresheners all over the place?
I'm trying a new medication for my lactose intolerance.
I believe the problem is physical.
And I think it can be cured by what I'm now referring to as the magic springy bounce-up chair.
Hey, Shawn, smoothies are here.
Pineapple?
Of course.
Thanks, Buzz.
You're having food delivered?
They were already going out.
Oh, boy.
I'm telling you Wow.
What did I tell you?
Now, take a hit off this bad boy and complete the moment, you've earned it.
What do you think this is, Mr. Guster?
I apologize.
This will never happen again.
Give me that.
Boys, out!
What is this, Gus, a smoothie?
You know these things stain.
Mmm.
But they are very delicious.
Chief, would you like some?
That's not my smoothie.
I don't care whose smoothie it is.
I don't even remember why I asked you to stay now.
You want us on that case with the blonde woman.
No.
Mmm-hmm, Wintersby, Wilacheck, Wislerbottom?
No, no, it's Wilcroft?
No, that's not Okay, wait a minute, were you listening in on my conversation?
I don't know if I heard it psychically or if I saw you walk by with her and Detective Lassiter, but I definitely heard the word "psychic.
" The woman, Raylene, said she visits an occasional psychic.
She wasn't asking for one.
Well, not in so many words.
No, not in any words.
This is a bank robbery case.
We don't need psychics for a bank robbery case.
Bank robbery?
Mmm-hmm.
I didn't read anything in the paper about a bank robbery.
It was four years ago.
So, it went unsolved?
It was solved.
Well, then what does she need a psychic for?
Gus, that is a perfectly reasonable question.
Thank you, Chief.
We'll be leaving now.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm still confused.
Her husband's partners are getting out of jail.
This is a routine warning that we issue when someone may potentially be in danger.
This is the part where we offer up our services.
No, I think this is the part where we leave.
That's a good idea.
But Believe it or not, Mr. Spencer, crimes were solved long before you got here.
And they continue to be solved when you're not around.
Oh, I remember what I wanted to tell you.
What?
Stay out of my chair.
Bank robbers?
Dude, that's awesome.
We should go find Lassiter and our future client.
We gotta go.
Dude, this woman is on an eternal quest for a good psychic?
That's me!
I'm gonna go find them.
I'm staying right here.
Great idea.
Wait ten seconds, and make an entrance.
Drink some.
Are you saying that I'm in danger?
Your husband's partners are being paroled today.
I have reason to believe their first order of business is gonna be to try and find that lost money.
But the only person who knew where that money ended up was my husband.
I know that.
But do they?
Hey, Lassi.
Juliet.
Oh, I don't believe we've met.
Or did we meet?
In a bank?
No, that's not it.
Why am I getting "bank"?
Piggy bank?
Sperm bank?
Doesn't matter.
I'm Shawn Spencer.
I am the official head psychic here at the department.
You don't have a title.
And there is serious doubt as to whether you're really even psychic.
I solved the McCallum disappearance.
And the Summerland murder.
Oh, and I found your keys.
And your badge.
Out.
Shawn, where are my keys?
No.
Out!
If you don't mind, we're a little busy.
We have a Excuse us, Raylene.
Do we know each other?
No, we don't.
I'm sorry.
Psychic, remember?
Sometimes I can't turn it off.
Do you do readings?
Yes, we do it all.
Full service.
I'm a bit of an enthusiast.
I used to have a regular girl read for me.
Really?
Here's a card.
We're at the beachfront location.
I could put my cell number on the back if you have any questions.
Any time, really.
Thank you, you're so kind.
This is a pharmaceutical company.
Like I said, we do it all.
Well, I always say, "A man with many hats " "Doesn't like his haircut"?
Exactly.
I thought I was the only one who read that book.
It's my favorite.
Mine, too.
Really?
And scene!
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Dude, what took you so long?
This is good stuff.
You gotta see what happened to this car.
I mean, it was really What?
What happened here?
Oh, that?
Oh, I had a drywaller come in and take out a wall.
A wall?
This is a rental!
What do you think our landlord is gonna say?
Gee, I don't know, "Thank you"?
Gus, this place was way too cramped.
My name is on that lease.
Don't worry, I'll make sure you get a thank you note, too.
You're taking my name off the lease.
And the door, and these Frisbees.
Gus, don't be ridiculous.
Look, I'm almost positive this isn't a load-bearing wall.
But if you're really concerned, why don't you go jump up and down in the attic and make sure?
What is she doing here?
Ah, she's our first real client.
Actually client?
Hired for the job?
Actual client.
Go on, man.
I have to admit, when I met you at the police station, I was intrigued, so I checked your recent track record.
It's amazing, really.
Well, it's a team effort.
Not really.
I do most of the work.
What can we help you with, ma'am?
I need you to get in contact with someone.
Well, tracking people down is our specialty.
What?
Oh, it's not, now?
This one might be a little tricky.
How tricky?
Is the person out of the state?
Country?
He's dead.
Ah, and I assume that's why you need a psychic.
Hold on.
Dead?
Like dead, dead?
Currently being eaten by worms?
He's actually entombed in a mausoleum.
Gus, he's ascended to the next dimension.
It's fine.
No, Shawn, I think we might be at a bit of an impasse.
What exactly do you need to know?
My husband was not a perfect man.
He got himself in a bit of trouble.
Okay, I'll be honest, it was a lot of trouble.
He got involved in a bank robbery.
He was one of three, but the only one who didn't go to prison.
Unfortunately, the reason he didn't get caught was that he drove his car down an embankment Wait.
I see rain.
No roads, no.
There was a fiery crash, wasn't there?
Yes.
What would you like me to ask, Raylene?
Well, this is hard to say.
But he was the one designated to bury the money.
They were to all meet later and divide the cash.
Only his partners were caught first.
So why wait until now?
His partners think that I know where he hid the money.
If I don't give it to them, they're gonna kill me.
Shawn, can I speak to you outside, please?
I guess.
Dude, what is wrong with you?
Shawn, I don't know how to break this to you, but you are not psychic.
Clue me in on the problem here.
It's a big problem when the job requires extensive conversing with the dead.
Gus, what is the question that she wants answered?
Where is the money, right?
That doesn't require any actual dead guy chitchat.
We simply trace his last steps, do a little research, ask a few questions, and bingo!
Stop saying "bingo.
" You know how I hate that.
Okay, fine.
Yahtzee.
We're not doing it, Shawn.
Mahjong.
Gus!
Mrs. Wilcroft.
Raylene.
Raylene.
Your problem is outside of our reach.
You are in real danger.
I'd like to recommend police protection.
I'm pleased to be of service.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I know they're in there.
Just so you know, I am uncomfortable with inter-office romance.
I wasn't considering it.
And I'm completely uncomfortable with the implication.
So, it wasn't true, the rumor about you and your last partner?
I'm not going to dignify that with a response.
This is them.
The bank robbers?
Yeah, a little worse for the wear than the day I arrested them.
You caught them?
I was part of a team, but, yeah, it was mostly me.
That's a big deal.
Would've been a big deal if I had found the money and closed the case.
Things like that make a career.
Instead, I got a bunch of loose ends, a dead guy, and 3.6 million in cash that vanished into thin air.
It's funny, they don't look so mean.
What do you mean "mean"?
They look like repairmen.
Big repairmen, but they don't look like killers.
Duck!
Eyes of a serpent, ears of a bat.
Send us a signal from Shawn.
I hear a voice.
Can I see you outside, please?
It wants me to come outside.
Now?
I should go.
Is that my bathrobe?
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm having a séance.
You can't have a séance!
Gus, there are no rules against having a séance.
Anyone can have one.
It's like a garage sale.
Or plastic surgery.
Okay, first of all, technically, you need to have a permit to have a garage sale.
Secondly, you cannot speak to the dead.
Oh, Gus, you don't understand at all, do you?
I don't need to make contact with the dead.
No, I need to speak with all the people in that room.
They're witnesses.
We can piece together the rest based on the information they give us.
I'm already on to something.
Check this out.
The dead guy was on the lam for three days with the cash.
He had help.
From whom?
I'm almost there.
Raylene?
Yes, Shawn?
I'm sensing the last time he called before the accident.
Ellen was the only one who talked to him.
Ellen.
Yes, I feel that deeply.
You didn't tell the police that, did you?
No, I was afraid.
He's my brother.
I didn't want to turn him in.
No, of course not.
Where did he call from?
A pay phone outside a store.
Yes, it was a store, I feel it.
Which store?
I think it was a Thriftymart.
Up north.
He'd been driving.
I've always imagined it was the one near Pismo.
Pismo!
Yes, but the spirits are confused, they need more specific directions.
Nearest cross street?
Just past the park we used to hike with Roger.
Who's Roger?
He's our cousin.
Really?
But wait, there's more.
The spirits are asking me.
What is Roger's address?
I really haven't seen Roger in years.
Come on, Ellen!
Work with me!
Think harder.
Okay, sorry.
How about a phone number?
Okay.
Gus, what have you done?
You've broken the chain of spiritual trust.
I didn't break anything.
Don't ruin it for everyone, Gus.
I'm not ruining anything.
Listen, Raylene, I have to apologize to you.
You seem like a very decent person.
But what you need is protection, not this.
A bodyguard, a policeman.
I can assure you, there is no spirit in here.
What?
And let me make you a guarantee, there is absolutely no way there will be any sort of contact with zombies You okay?
I think that's all for tonight, ladies.
Did you do that?
Why would I ruin our totally cool window?
For effect, to make me think you contacted an evil ghost.
Gus, please.
Why didn't you float that idea by me sooner?
That's genius.
Somebody obviously wants us off this case.
I think it's those convicts.
But whoever it is, we'll never find them.
I just saw them run off.
You sure about that?
Yeah.
Ladies, stay here.
We're going after them.
Or it.
Let's get some tacos.
Okay.
And then the window just shattered.
And you think ghosts did it?
No.
No.
No.
Though there may have been some women present who thought ghosts were responsible.
I blame it on the two convicts from the Holmby Bank robbery.
I'm sorry, I still don't understand why that means you need to see the entire case file.
Oh, no, no, Juliet, we don't need to see the whole thing.
No.
No, just the cover page, one or two others, here, there.
Definitely the witness list.
Well, you gotta see that.
And the Chief's okay with this?
Oh, yeah.
I don't think so.
No?
No.
I liked the other girl better.
Not me.
Hey, since we're here, we should do some digging.
Good idea, why don't you dig me getting the hell out of here and going to get some sleep?
Hey, I set you up for that.
Lobbed it right over the plate.
Mr. Spencer!
Oh!
Hey, you, what a surprise.
You look different.
Yes, I took your advice.
Three weeks without a cigarette.
Well, it has certainly enhanced your aura.
And remember, it wasn't my advice, it was your grandma's spirit.
Have you spoken to her again?
She's here.
Now?
Yes.
Where?
In this hallway?
No.
In the records room.
I thought I felt something eerie in there.
Me, too.
Unfortunately, I'm not allowed down there.
Please.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not too much light.
You don't want to scare her away.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I can feel her, all right.
She's She's over by the W's.
Why?
No.
W. This is it!
I'm nervous.
Don't be.
I want you to relax.
Breathe.
Close your eyes.
Why would she be in the W's?
I don't know.
Did you know any W's?
That bastard Walter.
Walter.
Your ex?
Wow!
Yes.
I hear something.
Yes, me, too.
Paper.
No, it's not paper.
Yes, it's clearly paper.
You have to concentrate.
Breathe deeply.
No, uh-uh.
I'm definitely not feeling anything anymore.
I think we've lost her.
I'm so sorry I couldn't reach her.
It's okay.
I know how temperamental the spirit world can Your hand!
Oh!
It was the spirits!
Yes.
It's a message from beyond.
What does it say?
I think I should keep it to myself.
It's a private message.
Dude, you look so peaceful when you're sleeping.
Never come in my apartment again.
You hear me?
I've seen the Holmby Bank file.
Look, Shawn, I don't want to The cousin is the key.
Which cousin?
The one the sister mentioned?
And then immediately regretted.
You could see it.
She let it slip.
Dude, the guy runs a cemetery.
Which one?
Oh, I don't know, the one David Wilcroft is buried in?
I'll bet you dollars to donuts he knows exactly where the money is.
Look, it's all right here on my hand.
His name is Roger Blaine, creepy as all get-out.
Lives on the grounds, alone, no wife, no kids.
Not that part.
That's the Italian seamstress I met at the Renaissance fair.
How much further is this place?
I don't know, And you didn't get me a donut?
I did get you a donut.
Then I ate it.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Solving a crime?
That happens to be our job description.
No, driving so far on a whim.
A whim, he says.
A guy dies and gets buried by his own weirdo cousin in a tiny cemetery way up the coast in a town with a population of 200.
That is not a whim, that is a clue.
You think the cousin has the money?
Roger Blaine?
That even sounds like an alias.
He could've killed Wilcroft.
Or it could have been the sister.
Gus, they're all kind of creepy.
The dead guy, the undertaker, the sister, Raylene.
Oh, there's nothing creepy about Raylene.
Nothing creepy about the melodramatic widow?
No.
Are you serious?
Who marries a bank robber?
Who sees a psychic every week?
There's nothing wrong with her, Shawn.
Okay.
What is this thing you have with women in jeopardy?
They have a name for this, you know.
It's called the Stockholm syndrome.
No, it's not.
Florence Nightingale's disease?
Are you trying to be funny?
You can't ridicule me because I want to help.
I can when you want to help too much.
You have an unnatural affinity for this woman that I simply cannot wrap my brain around.
She dresses like she's on her way to a PTA meeting.
Fine.
She reminds me of somebody who was very important to me.
Who?
Don't worry about it.
Oh, no.
What?
Don't say it.
What?
Don't say Meredith Baxter Birney!
It's not MBB!
This is unhealthy.
Okay, you were in love with her, too.
I loved her because she was Mrs. Keaton, and she gave birth to APK.
It's not her anyway.
Well, who is it?
My babysitter.
Your babysitter.
Yes, my babysitter.
Gus, Mrs. Pilderman was in her late 60s.
Mrs. Pilderman was 37 years old and she was a nurse, Shawn.
She taught me things, like, you know, about books and art.
Things like that.
Things like skinny-dipping?
I did not go skinny-dipping with Mrs. Pilderman!
Well, at least that sheds some light on it.
Huh, nobody's home.
No, somebody's here.
You can see through doors now, that's the new thing?
I can smell the laundry vent.
No, you can't.
Okay.
Oh, Gus, please with the supersmeller.
You have to stop!
Oh, dude, I can smell it, too.
I told you.
Jeans and socks and underwear and a Bounce sheet.
Make jokes.
How long do you think it takes to dry a load of clothes?
Thirty minutes?
Somebody's here and not answering the door.
Gus, I apologize.
That's very impressive detective work.
I feel a little bad about the donut thing now.
You should.
Dang it!
Let's try the back.
Just stay and watch.
Go on, G. Whoa!
You're not Roger!
No, no, you're You're David Wilcroft.
Aren't you supposed to be dead?
Gus?
Gus?
Look.
It's not that easy to explain.
I'm not a real criminal.
I just I got in a little over my head.
You robbed a bank.
I didn't want to.
I was in a bad place.
They trusted me.
I was supposed to stash the cash.
You lost the money.
Yeah.
How'd you know?
It was raining.
Really hard, for two whole days.
It was the worst rainstorm in 30 years.
You couldn't find it.
Yeah.
By the time the roads reopened, every marker I left was gone, it was washed away.
I lost three and a half million dollars.
Driving back, I nearly drove off the road.
It was then I realized I'd be better off dead.
And you have been digging ever since.
Every chance I can get out there without the risk of being seen by hikers or mountain bikers, I dig.
You know what?
Raylene is in agony over this.
I didn't mean her any harm.
You were never gonna tell her?
I couldn't.
Excuse us a moment.
What?
Gus, what's happening with you and this guy's wife?
Are you having feelings for this woman?
That's ridiculous.
No, no, Gus.
Gus, this is wonderful.
Look, we didn't know he was alive.
When she came to us she was technically available.
Shawn.
Stop it.
I'm not hitting on your wife.
No, he's not.
But there's some serious crushing going on here.
Dude, I am not blind.
"A man with many hats doesn't like his haircut"?
What book is that from?
She's a charming woman.
A charming woman?
Oh, you're Jane Austen now?
She's an adult, she is attractive, she's mature.
Shawn David, help me out here, tell him that this is healthy.
Raylene is a very dynamic woman.
Everybody is drawn to her.
Look, guys, I know you want to turn me in.
But you gotta understand I'm close.
I am so very close.
I've covered nearly every inch inside the Kalish trail loop where I buried it.
And you want us to let you find it?
Get her to hide someplace, someplace safe.
I just want to return the money and get on with my life.
Hmm?
We have to think this through.
Yeah.
You know, in my mind, they were the lucky ones, they got to go to prison, pay off their debt to society.
I've been living as a dead man.
If Raylene's going to find out that I'm alive, at the very least, don't let it come from a stranger, let it come from me.
We're letting him go?
He's not going anywhere until he finds that money.
I doubt that'll be anytime soon.
He did have cool hair, though.
God, we're missing something else here!
He's the key to solving this puzzle.
We need to tell Raylene.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're holding all the cards here, Gus.
Why would we do that?
Because she's in danger.
Maybe we can fix that.
Your husband, he's alive.
Gus!
Remember the part where we weren't going to tell her?
We never said that!
David's alive?
We found him.
He's with his cousin.
Roger?
No, no, no.
That can't be.
I'm sure your head is spinning and that you don't feel completely safe right now.
But rest assured, we do have a plan.
We are gonna put the convicts back in jail.
Where they belong.
And are gonna stay for a while.
We'll put these guys behind bars, where they belong.
So who authorized this stakeout?
What?
You know, who set it up?
I did.
I mean, who sanctioned it?
Approved it?
Above you.
Above me?
You know, I don't think I like where this is going.
I just mean it should be officially sanctioned as per the police code.
Which one?
Ticky-tack.
Doesn't apply.
In most cases someone still has to authorize it.
Oh, that's right, I remember now.
I did!
Well, what about 42.211?
What about it?
Well, it states that It's superseded by 15.75.
Not necessarily.
If you're in the jurisdiction of a 23.40, it is.
Maybe.
Maybe?
Technically, a 23.40 only applies in federal cases.
What are you doing in here?
I thought we could share info.
What are we looking at?
Get the hell out of my car!
Shouldn't you be wondering how I slid in and lounged for two minutes without you noticing?
You're new and pretty, so it's okay.
You've got ten seconds before I latch the doors and haul you down to the station.
They don't know where the money is.
What?
Isn't that why you're following them?
So they'll lead you to the money?
Psychic.
It's amazing.
You'll get used to it.
Look, the dead guy buried the money and then lost it, but that's beside the point.
I think we can cut our losses, put those two back behind bars, if we work together.
And how do we do that?
Well, first, we dress up as musketeers and make a very special pact.
Come on, you've watched them pull at least a handful of probation violations.
You've been tailing them.
You saw what they did to my office.
They haven't been anywhere near your office.
They were near enough to bust out my window two nights ago.
No, you're wrong.
You lost them, anyway.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Bye, Juliet.
They don't want our help?
Of course they don't.
But they also lost our guys.
Did you see where they went?
Did I see where they went?
You mean did I see their car turn right on Riverside?
Or did I see the parking tag from the 2400 Motel?
Touché!
Did you see what kind of whiskey they bought?
Shawn, please.
Time is being wasted.
This is breaking and entering.
No, no, no.
Only if we break something.
And then enter something.
Entering is just entering.
I'm not breaking a law, Shawn.
Look, you wanna save your little widow?
We've got to find some evidence to put these guys away.
I'm standing firm on this.
Fine, what about the window?
If it just opens, does that count?
Depends.
Ooh.
Hey, I see something.
Shawn?
I might be able to slide this chain off.
Shawn?
Gus, I'm trying to concentrate.
You might wanna turn around.
What?
Whoa!
You guys parked round back, huh?
Okay, okay!
Was that really necessary?
Were we resisting?
Man, window inspector?
In a motel?
Okay, I lied.
I did.
I'm sorry.
The truth is I'm a psychic.
That's what I do.
Perhaps you've read about me in the paper recently.
I've been in jail four years.
You don't have papers?
I thought you guys had TV and yard darts and mahjong and Okay, I come bearing a message from a departed being.
David Wilcroft wants you to know that he lost the money.
It's gone forever.
Why you telling us this?
He is concerned that you're going to harm Rins Racquel Raylene.
Raylene.
Oh, that's funny.
That is funny.
Jesse, can you make sure that we are not disturbed?
You can Can you prove you're a psychic?
Sure.
Sure.
You are a bank robber.
Yes, you did not like prison.
You are wearing the same pants that you were released in, and you have packed on a few pounds since being No, look, man, I'm talking about real proof!
Like a test.
Now, look, if you're right, you live.
If you're wrong Man, you don't wanna be wrong.
Here's the thing.
It's not really a parlor trick.
No.
And I don't want to cheapen it.
Look, prove it now.
Let's go.
What's wrong with you, man?
Move!
Okay!
Okay!
How many fingers?
How many fingers?
Are you kidding?
Do I look like I'm joking around?
How many fingers?
We gotta be able to come up with something better than that.
All right, man.
Time's up.
Four.
All right, how many now?
Two.
Now can we move on?
Because Gus and I have some questions that we Three.
For instance, why was it so funny Three.
And is it possible Still three.
Now it's technically two and a half fingers.
And the guy with the gun is flipping me the bird.
You can see my fingers, can't you?
No.
No.
Yes, yes, yes, I can.
It's the reflection of the TV bouncing off the mirror to the water pitcher here.
All right.
Okay, maybe not.
We're gonna try this one more time.
Now, how many fingers?
Dude, you need to stop picking three.
Respect, man.
Gee.
Oh, man!
That's Yep.
They're back here.
I can't believe we lost them.
Don't think that wasn't on purpose.
To Wilcroft.
A hell of a wheel man.
He was the wheel man?
Yeah.
You should know that, right?
Well, Shawn's visions sometimes are scattered.
Incomplete.
How does a wheel man miss a turn on a mountain road?
I tell you what, he didn't miss that turn.
I bet he just drove straight off.
You wanna know why?
Because he was trying to get away from his wife.
Damn, you're good.
No, no.
That can't be, why would he be We called her the Viper.
Man, she was cold as hell.
We had to do whatever she said, man.
We had no choice.
Who?
The wife.
Raylene?
You know her?
Well, she came to us, she wanted to contact David.
Figures.
That was her only weakness.
The occult.
Man, she'd stop at nothing to get her hands on that money.
No, she only wanted the money to protect herself from you two.
From us?
Yeah.
Man, the last thing we would ever do is cross her.
All we wanted to do was get away from her.
Especially David.
Man, she ran him around like he was an animal.
He did whatever she said.
Look, man, I don't know if you guys got caught up in the charm or whatever, but I'll tell you, man, that was her key.
She could play anybody.
I'm telling you she is a very dangerous lady.
Raylene was the mastermind?
I already knew that.
Because I'm a psychic.
Come on, guys.
We should go.
You don't want to go out that way.
Why?
We got company outside.
Is there another way out of here?
I can't believe I just crawled through a bathroom window.
It has to be a lie.
Gus, you're attracted to dangerous women, man.
It happens.
Joan Jett, for example.
Penny Marshall.
Grace Jones.
Or the woman who played Pinky Tuscadero.
She seemed so sincere.
So vulnerable, you know?
Yeah!
Turns out she's a domineering snake lady who drove her browbeaten husband to fake his own death.
And we, we led her right to the poor bastard.
Lizzie Borden, Kathy Bates!
Raylene!
This is not you Whoa!
What, today's gun day?
Sit.
"Just rush in here.
" Bad idea, Shawn.
Let her hang herself.
Quiet.
Raylene, I am sensing that this is going to end very, very badly.
Find me my money.
I know you have it.
He doesn't have it.
I'm the only one who knows where the money is.
Whoa!
He doesn't know where the money is.
Of course I know where the money is.
Shawn, I don't know what your strategy is, but you don't know where the money is.
You have five seconds.
One Really?
The countdown?
Two Three!
Okay, it's in the crypt!
The money's in the crypt?
Well, David here certainly isn't.
Think about it, Raylene.
Roger runs the place.
It's the perfect hiding spot.
They can get in and out whenever they want.
Pry it open.
With what?
With the stanchion.
Apparently those are called stanchions, Gus, were you aware of this?
Yes, I was.
How did you figure out that money was in the crypt?
I'm bluffing.
This is not a good time to bluff!
I think it's a great time!
She was going to kill us.
And besides, I've always thought a crypt was a great place to stash loot, you know?
It's kind of like a vault, I mean, you can just get in there whenever you need to.
She's gonna figure out you're lying.
Eventually.
But, come on, it's gonna take a while to bust open a crypt.
Wow.
Not as long as I was hoping for.
Help him get it out.
Raylene, please.
What are you waiting for?
That.
Son of a David?
I don't believe this.
Well, what are you going to do, Raylene?
Shoot all of us?
None of you are armed.
I can do whatever I want.
Really now?
Drop it.
You, move away from the stanchion.
What took you so long?
Shut up!
He does have nice hair.
Yeah, that takes a lot of upkeep, though, man.
Yeah.
You gotta worry about split ends Dandruff.
Dandruff.
It's horrible.
It's awful.
Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
The Wilcrofts are not talking at all to our investigators.
We get indications from their lawyers that they will plead the fifth to all charges, which leaves me with a whole slew of loose ends.
For instance, Detective Lassiter, could you tell me how you made the discovery that David Wilcroft was still alive?
Well, actually, Chief, we never made that connection, per se.
We were on a stakeout Yes, I see that.
You describe it as "harrowing and intense.
" I'm sorry, those were my words.
You wanted me to spell-check it.
I still don't understand how that connected you to David Wilcroft.
Well, that's where we come in, Chief, some good work was done By Detective Lassiter.
He was amazing.
He figured out there was a connection to Roger Blaine, the cousin, who was involved with the faking of the death.
Burnt body, no DNA, pretty convenient, he deducted.
I never said that.
No, but you thought it.
That's how good you are, Lassy.
You practically solved this entire case up here without uttering a spoken word.
I did nothing of the kind.
I was following the money and protecting Raylene.
Who turned out to be the dangerous one.
Which I picked up from Detective Lassiter's massive brain.
Not true.
True.
Not.
It was so!
Gentlemen, please.
So we still have no idea where the money is?
I got nothing from him.
But if he figures anything out I'll be the first to know.
Would you excuse us for a moment?
We're going to have a private conversation.
I know what you're doing.
Giving you credit?
You're trying to get me to admit you're psychic.
You've already done that.
No, I haven't.
You're right.
I'm sorry, you didn't actually say it.
Spencer, no matter what you do, I will never, never ever say those words.
Which words?
You know which words.
No, man, I lost my train of thought.
Which words?
Oh, that you think I'm a psychic.
Those words?
So when are you going to tell them where the money is?
I don't know where the money is.
Sure you do.
You're seeing dirt.
Am I right?
No!
What am I going to say now?
What are we doing here?
It's Saturday, I thought we'd get some fresh air.
We drove an hour out of town to get some fresh air?
Well, there's that, and we're gonna find the dread pirate Wilcroft's dirty booty.
Shawn, the guy's been digging for four years.
We're gonna find it in one afternoon?
Ninety minutes.
Tops.
And I brought some chicken for a hearty snack.
And how do you plan on finding it?
Well, he said he dug every inch of the Kalish Loop after he buried it here.
Right?
Yes.
Three miles' worth.
But it was dark and it had rained.
And he said he thought it was right off the path, he may have gotten lost.
I heard the story, Shawn.
Did he realize there's a J. Kalish and an L. Kalish trail?
Dude, it's completely defunct.
Check it out, only used by the rangers for back fires, medical access, mud slide emergency routes, like, for instance, during a torrential rainstorm.
Otherwise, it's gated and it looks completely abandoned from the road.
Okay, I find it, I get credit.
I'm the psychic, I have to get a vibration.
"Chief"?
"Yes"?
"I'm getting a trailhead, a pathway.
"And something else.
" "What is it"?
"Chicken bones.
"Yes, tandoori style.
"Fresh"!
"Oh, I bet they were delicious.
" "Yes.

{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
This isn't happening to me!
What is happening to you, Shawn?
Only the worst thing ever!
A missing Captain Delicious magic mood ring!
Dad, this is a crime.
Can you have them arrested?
First of all, Shawn, no, this is not a crime.
Can't you just haul them in for questioning?
Lay into them a little?
And who is "them"?
You know, the cereal people?
Oh, the cereal people, huh?
Well, I'll tell you what, Shawn, you can spend a lot of time calling 411 to get the number for your cereal people, they're gonna stick you on hold forever, listening to bad music.
Finally, you're gonna get some dimwitted secretary, who's gonna take your message, and then she's gonna throw it in a waste bucket.
Or you can use the skills I taught you and you can outsmart them.
What am I missing?
Where is the ring?
Well, it'd be at the bottom.
Not in this box, you're right.
The big old bad cereal company messed up.
So, you grab another box, tough luck.
Where's the ring now?
At the bottom.
Now I got to eat the whole box.
And where's the ring now?
At the top!
That's right.
You see, sometimes, Shawn, you don't have to dig so deep.
All you gotta do is turn something upside down to make it right side up.
And then you get your prize.
Thanks, Dad!
Explain to me again why we couldn't sit in a restaurant and eat like civilized people.
Moving is good, Gus, it helps the digestion.
Plus, you and I never do this anymore.
What?
Eat and jog?
No, talk.
Just talk.
Check in with each other, as men.
I wanna know how you are.
I wanna know how Gus is.
Really?
Like you're really asking me?
Yes, I'm really asking, because I care.
Wow, okay.
Well, we've been working cases nonstop for a month.
To be honest, I'm burnt.
I just want to take a nap.
I couldn't agree with you more, buddy.
I think we should lay low for a bit.
No more cases.
Oh, I'm so glad to hear you say that.
I was kind of worried about telling you.
Don't be a silly goose.
Now, we've had a good talk, I think we both felt it, and look at this.
Here we are.
What is this, Shawn?
Okay, here's the thing.
The police may have found a body, which I may have picked up on my police scanner, which I may have brought with me.
No cases, Shawn.
No cases.
We go in, we see.
We say hello.
And we leave.
Say hello?
This is a crime scene.
You can't just walk in there.
McNab.
Nabby!
Buzz.
Buzz?
Seriously?
That's his first name.
Don't you ever talk to him?
Why would I talk to anybody named Buzz?
Shawn!
My man!
Pow!
Okay with Yes.
You look trim.
Somebody made their wedding weight.
Five more pounds.
I'm close.
But I still have a month.
You'll get there.
You remember my partner?
Sure, yeah.
Matt, right?
Gus.
Right.
So, what do you got going on up there?
Don't hold out on me now.
Looks like suicide.
A guy from the phone company found the victim in his apartment.
Been up there for a few days already.
Few days?
You mind if we head up, take a look, poke around a little?
Oh, I don't know.
Lassiter's up there and he's in a mood.
Yeah, we just, uh, got his coffee.
Wanted to bring it by, make it right.
Oh, that's nice of you.
He asked me to get it, but this is perfect.
Hey, did you just sip that?
You don't taste Lassiter's coffee before you give it to him?
That surprises me, Buzz.
He's so particular.
No cream, no sugar It's three creams, four sugars.
Yeah, it is.
Sharp as a tack.
You!
And fit!
We found a note.
The body's been here at least three days.
Maybe more.
All signs point to a 11-44.
Three 11-44s in four months?
There must be something in the water.
Uh-huh.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, listen up.
You know the procedure.
I want this done right.
I do not want any mistakes.
Hey, blowie, I know you're new, but next time if you want to get your spit all over the evidence, why don't you just lick it?
Clearly he doesn't need any more coffee.
Okay, there is the dead guy.
Can we go now?
Relax.
We just got here.
Have some mee krob.
How do you just eat when there's a dead guy laying there?
What, is that rude?
Am I supposed to share?
Forensics.
Act natural.
That's it!
What?
What do you see?
Red pepper flakes.
Is that a clue or something?
No, it's a delicious spice, and it's exactly what my mee krob needs.
I told you this.
What are you doing?
This is a crime scene.
You can't touch stuff.
What?
Seriously, check this out.
A marinating steak?
What, you want to eat that, too?
No, but don't you find that a little odd?
That a man would eat a steak?
No, that a man who was ready to kill himself would take the time to marinate a steak for a future meal?
Dude, this was not suicide.
This was murder.
The door latch is still intact.
Now I ask you.
If you were gonna kill yourself, wouldn't you want the door to be locked so that no one could barge in on you right in the middle?
What?
I don't What is it?
I don't What in the name of sweet justice are you two doing in my crime scene?
Your crime scene?
That's funny.
I didn't see your name on it anywhere.
Get out.
We are.
Just thought you might wanna know that this thing here, not a suicide.
Great.
Thanks for that.
Really.
And thanks also for bringing a snack to the crime scene.
Oh, boy.
Oh!
I'm sensing a I'm sensing there was someone here.
Someone here in the room with the victim when he died.
Someone with a sliver of grease on his or her shoe.
No, I'm not sensing a struggle.
No struggle.
The door.
Did you have to break down the door when you got here?
No, it was open.
Why?
No, no.
Don't encourage him.
Get up!
McNab, I want you to escort these two men out of here now!
Come on, let me read the witnesses.
You know, due diligence.
Spencer, we did the due diligence.
It was a suicide.
There is no crime.
There are no witnesses.
You're wrong.
There is a witness.
There's a cat.
I wanna talk to that cat.
As soon as he's finished licking himself.
Wow, I'm jealous.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I can't believe you took that cat.
Gus, they were gonna ship him off to an animal shelter.
What choice did I have?
Plus, this cat is the lead witness in a major murder investigation.
Wanna hold him?
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not touching that cat.
You took the cat, you carry it.
We are right on this thing now.
I didn't have anything substantial.
A steak, the chain on the door, a stain on a carpet I wouldn't have believed me.
We needed an in.
Now we have one.
Plus, he clearly likes you.
Give him a snuggle.
You know what?
I'm actually gonna enjoy this.
You having to carry this cat around, pretending you can communicate with it.
I'm buying a disposable camera for when you have to clean out its dirty litter box.
Let me tell you something.
This cat here is a gift.
A conduit for us to save lives.
And he has more integrity in his furry little hand Paw.
Paw.
than most people have in their whole appendages.
Appendages.
What?
All of them.
Than most people have in all of their appendages combined.
Oh, yeah?
I think he wants to sleep on your chair.
Isn't it cool?
How long are you gonna keep this up for?
Until we solve the crime.
Don't you or your cat get mad at me, but I don't think there was a crime.
Oh, really?
You don't think so?
No.
Try telling that to this poor little guy who is traumatized seeing his owner killed.
Tell him.
I'm just saying I can kind of get where Lassiter is coming from.
A few suicides is not uncommon.
Gus, did you look at the sky today?
Blue, clear.
And did you feel it out there?
Warm.
Nice.
Statistically, people in mild climates are far less likely to kill themselves.
Now, if we were in Vladivostok, we could talk.
Point is, at the end of the day, this was a 50-year-old man living alone with a cat.
Do you want down?
You can get down.
You're probably right.
I know I'm right.
It was probably a suicide.
Thank you.
That was big of you to admit.
I'm just I'm unclear on one little thing.
What's that?
How do we explain the second body they just found?
Deceased is in the car, over.
Detective O'Hara.
What, you're here all by yourself?
Ah!
Damn it all.
Could have happened to anybody.
Talk to me.
Well, victim is a female in her late 20s, Gloria Starks.
We're waiting for forensics to confirm, but appears to be a suicide.
Carbon monoxide poisoning.
Asphyxiation.
Oh, I'm afraid the cat doesn't think so.
Turn around and walk away.
This cat can tell us if the killer has been here.
All I need is 30 seconds.
Watch this.
You ready boy?
Huh?
You ready?
What?
What, over here?
Where?
Wait.
That is That is very thoughtful.
I'll tell him.
He says the fact that you take three creams and four sugars in your coffee, dangerous.
Is that true?
Do you really take three creams and four sugars?
So what?
So what?
Carly, that is a heart attack waiting to happen.
You're still a young man.
That was amazing.
How did you do that?
It was a lucky guess.
Don't you get tired of saying that?
Now, with your permission, I'd like the little boy cat to sniff out the car.
Absolutely not.
Oops!
What did I just say?
Just relax and let him do his job.
He might find something.
He's peeing.
No.
No, he's drawing your attention to the evidence in the back seat.
By peeing on it.
Nice.
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Yes, did you make good pee-pee?
Did you make good pee-pee?
Yes, you did.
What?
What.
That's a That's a little inappropriate.
I'm sorry, that's rude.
He was just saying that he would have done the same thing, if he'd killed himself.
He would have swung by the dry cleaners and grabbed the pantsuit first.
Maybe she picked up the dry-cleaning days ago.
Did the cat ever think of that?
What is he doing right here?
He is measuring the amount of carbon monoxide emitted.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
I knew that.
Yeah, you did.
Whoa!
Now, does she strike you as the type that would go for heavy metal?
Any number of people could have changed her radio station.
Now, Mr. Spencer, if you and your new partner are finished urinating on things, I believe your work here is done.
Check out the dry-cleaning.
I'm on it.
Look, I don't care what Lassiter says.
The cat is not my new partner, Gus.
Don't be ridiculous.
Then tell me again why the cat gets to ride shotgun?
He gets carsick, and you know this.
Do you want him to throw up again back there?
Is that what you want?
It's not funny, Shawn.
Here, lay these down.
He's doing fine, aren't you?
This is a company car, Shawn.
That means I have to return it in like-new condition.
Lay these down.
Whoa, whoa!
Look at this!
What?
"Seventy percent off of storm doors and window panes.
" "Everything must go.
" Gus, flip it over.
It's her.
"Struggling actress lands big break in Santa Barbara play.
" And then kills herself?
I don't think so.
Okay, you might be onto something.
Yeah.
The play is called Dazzle and Stretch.
Dazzle and Stretch?
I was wondering if I could ask you a question.
I could really use some advice.
Yeah, all right.
Get on in here.
What can I do for you, McNab?
It's just that, well You're still married, right?
Are you trying to piss me off?
No, sir, no.
I just have a question.
On your wedding night did you feel any, well, any added pressure to perform?
Excuse me?
It's just that my Francie is going to be expecting a lot on our first night as a married couple, and I was wondering if you had any tips for me.
What the hell kind of sick bastard are you?
Thank you very much, sir.
I appreciate it.
So, what you are trying to tell me is now it's the cat that's convinced these weren't suicides?
Yes.
Do you really think I'm going to open a bunch of closed cases just because a cat tells me to?
This is it.
Yes, this is it.
The girl that was found in her car, Gloria Starks, she's here.
She's here with us.
Oh, despair!
I fear that you will leave me.
What choice do I have?
I dazzle And I stretch I dazzle And I stretch What the hell is going on here?
Mr. Spencer, this is telling me nothing.
He can't hear you right now 'cause, see, he's channeling the cat who's channeling Gloria.
I dazzle Well, then what are we looking at?
Bad acting.
I think she wants you to see something in the paper.
Gloria's trying to tell you something.
Dazzle and stretch "Seventy percent off on storm doors and window panes.
"Everything must go.
" "Struggling actress lands big break in Santa Barbara play.
" So what.
So what?
Does that sound like a woman who would kill herself?
Please, all actresses are crazies.
I know, I dated one in college once.
She had a nose ring.
Good work, little buddy.
Whoa!
I don't know.
This is something.
Something?
Oh, come on, you guys.
That's the biggest thing that ever happened for that girl.
Now you need to stop waiting around for another suicide and start looking for a serial killer.
Spencer, get off my lap.
What does this mean?
I have no idea, but I've seen it on Numb3rs all the time and it seems to work for them.
You ready to give up?
Four separate suicides, two of which occurred before we came on the case, and I don't see a pattern of any kind.
Different ages, different sexes.
Different socio-economic levels.
Different methods of death.
No duplicate weapons, locations.
Man, what have we got?
First we have a jumper, second, an oven, third, pills, fourth, carbon monoxide.
They all have to be connected somehow.
And what I see is whole lot of nothing.
Nothing.
You see, sometimes, Shawn, you don't have to dig so deep.
You just need to turn things upside down to make them right side up.
And there's your prize.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
Turning things upside down in order to make them right side up.
And there's the prize.
This is the prize?
Going to the first dead guy's place and what?
Talk to a dead guy?
No, we talk to the dead guy's brother.
The dead guy's brother lives at the dead guy's place?
They were roommates.
But that's the point.
He's getting rid of the apartment.
And we're here to rent it.
We're what?
Why can't we for once just talk to somebody as us?
Because, Gus, I don't want him to be on guard.
If he thinks we're investigating something, he'll clam up.
Wes Hiltonbock?
Yeah?
Hey, Shawn Spencer.
I talked to you on the phone about the apartment, and this is Gus.
It would actually be for both of us.
Yeah, okay, come on.
Thanks, man.
Just so you guys know, the utilities are included, but I would require first and last month and a sizable security deposit.
Oh, that's not a problem.
You take cats?
Yeah, I guess so.
You two guys have a cat?
We do, actually.
He's sort of like our child.
I see.
How do you guys know each other?
We're partners.
Got you.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, it's fine.
Really, I'm totally fine.
No, we're partners in a private Relationship.
Believe it, it's been a while.
We finish each other's sentences.
So, tell me, Wes, why would you want to give up such a handsome apartment?
Do you Do you not like it anymore?
Ooh, Gus, good news, shower for two.
Actually I just have some bad memories here.
I used to I used to live here with my brother, but he passed away.
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
Was he sick, or He killed himself.
Oh, good Lord.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.
We were real close, you know.
God, was he depressed?
I mean, were there signs?
Did you What am I I'm sorry, you don't have to answer those questions.
No.
Actually, I had no idea anything was wrong, you know.
I mean, he had so much to live for.
He was a great guy, you know.
Smarter than me, more talented.
He was a great singer.
He was really going places.
So look, are you guys You guys interested in the place or What do you think, honey?
I think it's great.
I think it's perfect.
All right, then.
Well, I got another couple coming by a little later so But I'll let you guys know either way.
Shower for two?
That was so I could see your face when I said it.
You know, you enjoy these things more than you should.
I suffered through that for no reason.
We learned nothing.
Yes, but I grabbed this while we were up there.
You took his mail?
It's not like I took his Sports Illustrated.
Dude, it's a phone bill.
You can't open someone else's mail, Shawn.
It's a federal offense.
Gus, he's dead.
So what?
Well, maybe I'll hold it to my head and read it psychically.
Hurry up, Shawn.
Gus, who's gonna see us?
Hurry up.
Wait, there's like There's like 16 calls here to some 1-800 stress line.
Including the last call he made.
I've seen the ads for that.
So what?
A depressed guy calls a stress line.
And I bet you a hungry guy calls a pizza place.
That doesn't tell us anything.
Yeah, but it might give us a link.
I'm gonna run the other victims' phone records.
With what?
Your do-it-yourself phone record running kit?
The next best thing.
The answer is in the phone bills.
I need you to run the victims' phone records.
What, no cat this time?
Julie, I'm very serious about this.
I have a strong sense about a stress line and I know the link is in the phone records.
I don't know why you would think I would do something like this for you.
Some have said it's the hair.
Really?
Who says that?
Oh, guess what?
We already ran the phone records and checked out the dry-cleaning.
Turns out the pantsuits were picked up over a week ago.
What kind of dog and pony show do you think we run here?
Gus, you wanna take this one?
No.
Let me put an end to this non-case right now, okay?
Yes, all the victims called the 1-800 stress line.
Not just once, many times over.
Detective Lassiter and I have combed everything.
We've gone to the bone on these.
All the way to the bone?
I know this is hard for you to grasp, but these people did have something in common.
They were troubled and they were depressed, and as sad as that is, they all committed suicide.
Case closed.
We've clearly wasted your time.
It's not over, is it?
Of course not.
They all called the same help line and they all killed themselves?
Come on!
Shawn, that's what stressed people do.
Strange how he gave up so easily.
Yeah, it is.
Maybe we should take a closer look at that stress line.
Gloria Starks only called that line 'cause she was stressed about an audition.
You call a help line and they find you dead?
That's not very helpful.
What if someone there is killing the callers and making it look like suicide?
Gus, we go to the stress line, I think we solve the case.
Come on.
Ta-da!
What is this?
You're looking at our new business.
Mazel tov.
Are you out of your mind?
You rented office space for this?
Gus, don't be a crazy hooligan.
I rented a sign.
Now, let's go say hello to our new neighbors.
Hello, everyone!
Who wants pineapple?
Be honest.
Ah, you guys can slice it up, fight over it later.
I'm sorry, gentlemen, may I help you?
I'm Terrance, I run the line here.
Terrance, hello.
I'm Shawn Spencer, this is my partner Gus "Silly Pants" Jackson.
Just came by to say hello.
We've opened up our own little Not as big as you guys.
More of a closet, really.
Your own 1-800 thingy, huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's called Dial-A-Psychic.
Maybe you recognize us.
I am the lead psychic for the Santa Barbara police department.
McCallum murders.
Edmond robberies?
Over there, you?
Nothing?
Nothing?
Wow, really.
What, do you guys live in this room?
So, you can know stuff about me just by looking at me?
Yeah, pretty much.
Do it.
Do it?
Go ahead, show us.
Looking for a little demo.
Well, for one, they don't like pineapple.
I don't know guys.
I don't think Big T wants us to take up any more Oh, no, no, no.
Go right ahead.
Half the lines are down, phones are being worked on right now.
We have time for your little trick.
Oh, yeah?
Let's see what I can come up with.
Loose flowing stanzas, Bobby Frost.
Are you a poet, by chance?
Yeah!
Yeah, I am!
Wow.
How did you know that?
I guess you could say I'm a bit of a psychic poet.
Oh, please, stop.
'Cause I'm like, I'm freaking out here!
Do you see his eyeliner?
Guy could be the drummer from The Cure.
Wow, I can see why you come out here to eat.
It's beautiful.
Sound of the seagulls, the smell of the ocean, the salt air Hmm.
I never noticed.
What do you got there?
What you asked for.
I ran the sheets on all the volunteers at the stress line.
Do you mind?
It's police business.
Scram.
Let's see what we got here.
Well, lookie there.
It's a picture of an old friend.
Hmm.
Hey, Rory.
Where the hell have you been?
I've been sitting on this mop bucket in this tiny closet for the last hour and a half waiting for you to show up.
I'm all cramped.
Well, get up, man.
Do some pushups or something.
I need you light and limber.
Do some pushups?
Sure, like Clint Eastwood in Escape from Alcatraz.
Sure, he spends the whole movie in a tiny little cell, right?
But he's in the best shape of his entire life.
Give me a little piece of tape.
What happened to the big ticking time clock?
Gus, what do you think I've been doing all day?
My work happens here and here.
What are you doing?
I am trying to create a pleasant work environment.
I can tell by looking at your little area that you don't care.
We don't work here, Shawn.
We do until we solve these murders.
But don't worry, I have a plan.
You are gonna call the stress line and pretend to be depressed.
No, I'm not.
Yes.
And I will go down the hall when you make the call, ask for Rory, so that I can see him in action.
Why don't you call him?
Gus, please be serious for one second.
No one's gonna believe that I'm depressed.
Come on.
I got an idea.
Why don't you have the cat make the call?
He's like your new partner, right?
Where is he, anyway?
Gus, he's far more comfortable in your car.
Plus, I need him well rested for when he identifies the killer.
Now, wait exactly two seconds and then make the call.
Oh!
I have no idea what I'd even say.
Here's a good opener.
"Hello, my name's Gus.
"I have a deep-seated jealousy for a tiny little boy cat.
" Why would you put them on speakerphone?
See, because I think that tends to undercut Big T!
Look sharp!
What is it now, Mr. Spencer?
Just wanted to pick your brain for a second.
How many lines you got going here?
I have 12 lines, but I'm adding more all the time.
I get it, I get it, the more lines, the more green, am I right?
I'm a non-profit operation.
The calls are free.
I'm not in this for the money.
Really, that's weird.
See, I'm thinking of charging four bucks a minute.
Rory.
Rory!
Hey, Ror.
Hey.
You really do love your music, huh?
You kidding?
Music inspires me.
Yeah, you know, you don't really strike me as the Charitable type?
I was gonna say sensitive, but sure.
Actually, I'm here as part of a community service on this assault beef, you know.
I got into it with this guy who didn't like my poetry.
So, 250 hours.
Two-fifty, wow, that's intense.
Rory, that's Line 6!
I'll let you get back to work.
Sorry.
Hello, Stressline, the extra S is for extra stress.
This is Rory.
Uh-huh.
Right, so you're experiencing some stress.
Career and personal?
Well, yeah, I suppose.
I mean my career's not exactly where I would like it to be.
No.
No, I don't have a girlfriend right now.
It's been awhile.
Right.
Right, that's not good.
Does it make you have dark thoughts?
Like how dark are you talking?
Like, "wanna be dead" dark?
Okay, easy, I just wanna say this, like, right off the bat, suicide is not the answer.
Who said anything about suicide?
I just said maybe I should find a new hobby, like coin collecting.
Or something at the beach.
I like water activities.
Like drowning?
What?
Drowning?
I don't want to drown!
No, no, of course you don't.
That's awful, okay?
But I don't care what you say about suicide in a lake being poetic, you know, like, your body floating to the top of the pristine, serene waters and your final breaths rippling out in an ever-widening circle, you know, like the circle of life.
But you have to stop that kind of thinking.
You have so much to live for.
You're damn straight, I have a lot to live for!
Of course you do.
You see, I can tell, this phone call is helping you already.
Dude, what the hell was that?
Was he trying to help me?
Cause I feel really creeped out right now.
Dude, he put you on the creepy train headed for Creep Island where the natives drink creep nectar out of creepy coconut shells Shawn, it's horrible.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
He's nuts, Shawn.
Yes.
And worst of all, he actually made some good points!
I mean, pharmaceutical sales, not sexy.
You are my only non-work friend.
There's got to be something wrong with that.
Hey, hey, hey, what is this?
What?
Hang in there.
He's right, I need to start taking some more risks.
Does that mean we can go cliff diving in Zihuatanejo?
No.
I'm being serious, Shawn!
Look, would it make you feel any better if I told you Hiltonbock called?
We got the apartment!
What would make me feel better is if we called the police!
This guy is dangerous, Shawn.
Let's call Vick.
Maybe get him arrested.
Gus, Gus!
What?
The only thing this guy is guilty of right now is being a bad poet.
You know how this game works.
We cannot just pick up a phone and beg the police to come and save us.
Look, just Just stay away from the water for now.
Final decision, we wait.
No, it's this way.
You sure?
Yes.
Now, was that so hard?
Maybe you'd care to explain this.
My eyeliner pencil?
So, you admit it's yours.
Funny how Gloria Starks' suicide note was scrawled across her windshield in black eyeliner.
Yet no eyeliner was found at the crime scene.
You, my friend, are looking at exhibit A. Bag it, O'Hara.
You like your music, don't you, Rory?
Yeah, I do.
It's my inspiration.
I bet.
I bet it inspires you to kill.
That's why you couldn't resist playing your big-haired, drug-induced death music on Mortimer Tilden's stereo while you forced him to swallow all those pills.
Or on Gloria Starks' car radio while she slipped into unconsciousness.
And even now.
Let's have a little listen, shall we?
What, you think you can pull a fast one on me switching out your head-thrashing crap for this noise?
This crap is all I listen to.
I hate metal music.
I use the details that I get from callers to write better poems.
I am not a killer!
Yeah, I know, you're a poet, but you're also an assaulter, aren't you?
Who do you think arrested you on that assault charge?
Oh, a guy from the phone company found the victim.
I didn't kill anybody.
Get him out of my sight.
What?
You're not taking notes?
How could you let him do that?
Now Lassiter gets credit for solving the crime and we won't get paid.
Oh, we're gonna get paid.
How do you figure?
Lassiter didn't solve the crime.
Rory is innocent.
He didn't do it.
He didn't?
No.
Then who did?
Just grip the spike with your little foot and climb!
Come on!
Why do I gotta go first?
'Cause you're a climbing machine, Gus.
Just, you know, be careful.
Grip the spike with your foot!
Okay, oh, okay, okay.
Grease.
Dude, dude!
Dude, I know who the killer is!
Can I come down then?
No, no, stay up there.
I have to figure out where he's headed.
Who is it?
Well, put it this way, I don't think taking the apartment is such a good idea, unless you think it's cool that our would-be landlord is a serial killer.
Hiltonbock?
There was a pattern.
See, all the murders coincide with dates that Hiltonbock was servicing the phone lines.
That's when he had access.
With this?
Yes.
Yeah, yeah, send that down.
Perfect!
See, this device stores all the incoming and outgoing calls.
My guess is that wherever number he dialed last, that's where Hiltonbock is headed.
And whoever that is, is probably his next victim.
Hello, you've reached Buzz McNab.
I'm not in right now, but please do leave a message and I will get back to you when I get in.
Oh, no.
Who are you calling?
Hello, Chief?
Hey, Shawn Spencer here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look, I'm getting a vibe right now as big as a Buick!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, you don't.
Stay, boy cat!
Hey, McNab, so this is the place, huh?
It's nice.
It's really nice.
Drop it!
Don't come any closer.
Put it down or I will drop you!
I swear to God I'm gonna shoot him.
Drop it!
Everybody breathe, just breathe!
Get out of here.
Well, the other ones must have gone a lot smoother than this, huh, Hiltonbock?
Though, comparatively, it was probably pretty easy to get Mortimer Tilden to swallow those pills.
You wanna die, old man, huh?
Eat them!
Because you are not really a cold-blooded serial killer.
Are you?
No, but he threw his own brother off a building!
I didn't push him off the roof.
No, no, no.
No, you didn't.
You didn't do that.
But you were there.
You saw it.
You saw the whole thing.
You saw him jump off the balcony of the apartment that you shared.
He was weak.
There's a lot of weak people out there, Hiltonbock.
Are you gonna track them all down, huh, one at a time?
Punish them for their weakness?
You wanna get back at your brother so badly, you don't even care who these people were, just that they called the line.
And look, you're gonna kill McNab here just because he had a few pre-wedding jitters.
I was just looking for a little advice.
Nobody else would talk to me.
It's okay, Buzz.
We all have stress.
All of us.
Right here in this room.
I mean, take a good look, Hiltonbock.
We all have problems.
Who else deserves to get shot or hung?
Maybe it's Gus.
That's enough, Spencer.
No.
Shoot him.
What are you doing?
Yeah, maybe I should.
Don't listen to him.
He's a crazy person, he's crazy.
That's right, I am crazy.
So maybe you should shoot me.
Okay.
Here's the best part.
It doesn't matter what I think, because you have a problem that's a lot bigger than me.
This guy.
The man with his gun trained on you is not only a fine human being, with a strong Irish hairline, he is an exemplary public servant and arguably the finest detective mind in the lower western Santa Barbara County area over the age of 35.
And right now, while I'm speaking, he is devising a swift and stealth-like tactic that is going to disarm you and blow your freaking mind!
Anytime you're ready.
All right, we gotta make the move.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
That was adequate, Spencer.
Don't thank me.
Thank the little boy cat.
There you are.
There's my big guy.
There's my big guy.
You are a hero.
You are a hero today.
Yes.
Speaking of heroes, McNab, I was gonna get you something off the registry online, but it turns out the Chief already got you the asparagus steamer.
So, instead I give you this little guy.
Yeah.
If you take him in the car, he likes to ride upfront, shotgun.
You know, there's something beautiful about the color Fruity Puffs turns the milk.
I think it's the most beautiful thing in the whole world.
You know, I've been thinking.
You're not the only one who lives a charmed life, Shawn.
I got it pretty good, too.
Yes, you do, and it makes me glad to hear you say so.
I mean, the other day at work, this dermatologist, Katie Finestatt, commented how I looked handsome carrying my sample case into her office.
Finestatt said that?
Yes, she did.
And she is fine.
So, it got me thinking, maybe pharmaceutical sales can be sort of sexy.
There are times when I have to stand a few feet away because you're literally sizzling.
You see what I'm saying?
I mean, you may be my only non-work friend, but you're my best friend.
And how many best friends does one guy need, really?
That's my point.
It's all in the attitude, Gus.
Exactly.
Not sweating the small stuff.
Life is too short.
Too short.
Changing my attitude, Shawn.
Where the hell is my prize?
Where's my ring, Shawn?
Easy now.
No, no, I've timed the bowls out perfectly, Shawn.
Me, then you, then me, then you, then I get the prize!
What happened to "Not sweating the small stuff?
"Life's too short," all that?
Did you open the bottom of the box?
Now, why would I do something like that?
That's my ring.
You know I would kill for that ring, don't you?
Oh, you're upsetting me.
You just changed my mood from an orangey yellow to a muddy brown.
You need to say something sweet.
Quick.
Gus!
That's so childish.
I'm gonna eat yours!
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
"For every action, there is an opposite and equal reaction.
" Who?
Isaac Newton, third law of motion.
And how does that apply to the nature of man?
Anyone?
Shawn.
You push, they push back.
Correct.
Why?
Because man is a stupid creature who'd rather fight than use his brain.
And what idiot said that?
You did.
The name of the game is survival, sports fans.
In order to survive, you've got to fight.
And if you fight, you better damn well win.
Because if you don't win, and you don't use your brain, then what happens?
Gus?
You lose?
And for this troop, that is not an option.
Comprende?
Sir, yes, sir!
Because losing is for lowlifes.
Losing is for quitters.
Are you boys lowlifes?
Are you boys quitters?
Sir, no, sir!
Troop 101, ten-hut!
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the Junior Bobcat Manual's infamous Exercise Number 32, the launching of a solid fuel rocket.
Now, one of you lucky grunts is gonna nab this thing and you're gonna haul ass back to me.
The prize?
A hot fudge sundae.
But if you lose?
What does the loser get, Shawn?
He gets to look on with envy.
That is correct.
He gets to look on with envy.
Because that, gentlemen, is the American way.
On your marks.
Ready.
Set.
Go!
What's this?
A parachute.
I sent you after a rocket.
Shawn?
Where's my rocket?
I thought he had it.
A shortcut!
You took a shortcut!
A shortcut, huh?
Prove it.
I'll tell you what, I beat you this time, I'm eating the sundae.
Ooh, just in time.
For what?
The annual Civil War re-enactors meltdown.
The event isn't until next weekend.
Yeah, but this is the best part, the rehearsal.
This is what they should charge for.
Form battle lines!
Prepare muskets!
Is that Lassiter?
Yes, it is.
What died on his face?
Charge!
Stop, stop, stop!
Stop!
Okay, guys, that was better.
Really.
It was good, actually.
Okay, it wasn't good.
Look, guys, I know I promised last week that I wasn't going to give any more notes.
But, guys, come on, that last charge, it was How do I say this?
It was a soul-sucking embarrassment that made me ashamed to wear the uniform.
Luke Bauer?
Where's Luke?
Colonel Lassiter, sir!
Luke, what did I say about the bayonet gag, huh?
Too much.
There's gonna be kids watching this, all right?
We don't want the people in the grandstands to vomit.
Okay, I know we haven't reenacted this one for a while.
But the battle at Piper's Cove, Kentucky, 1864, is special to me.
It ended Confederate Quantrill's plot to assassinate Lincoln.
And it involved my great-great-grandfather, Colonel Muscum T. Lassiter Muscum?
What the hell is a Muscum?
It was a very common name of the era.
History Channel.
ESPN, Gus.
Channel 206.
I'm begging you.
Hey, Jules!
Wanna join?
Oh, can I?
I don't know.
Do you have your own hoopskirt?
I rent one.
Sally Reynolds, front and center.
You missed your cue, Sally.
The cannon fired, yet no Sally.
I got stuck in the hospital tent.
Sergeant Menish had a quick question about his homeowner's policy.
How touching.
However, today you are not here to sell insurance, Sally.
Today you are here to help me win the Civil War.
And according to our battle plan, when the fifth cannon fires you exit the hospital tent and you shoot Captain Quantrill off his horse.
There's no need to get nasty.
I agree.
It was totally out of line.
Sorry, I didn't think you could hear that!
Sally, sweet Sally.
If you do not point your gun at Captain Quantrill and fire at the prescribed moment, the audience will not be able to make heads nor tails of what we are doing.
And it will appear as if the evil Captain Quantrill, now being portrayed by our horrifyingly method-acting Nelson Poe who happened to roll way off his mark, by the way, fell off his horse and is lying here for no apparent reason at all.
Get up, Nelson.
Nelson, I swear to God, if you're sleeping through rehearsal again I said get up!
Okay, either that guy is a phenomenal actor or he's dead.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Oh, come on, let me in on this.
No.
I was there.
Inexplicably drawn to the scene.
I was meant to solve this case.
It's sort of like a miracle.
You have been out there every weekend we've rehearsed.
And don't think I didn't see you trying to throw M&Ms in the injured soldiers' mouths.
Okay, first of all, those were Skittles, and they have a rainbow of flavors.
The answer is still no.
Beat it.
Oh!
Hold it!
I'm suddenly seeing Nelson.
The bullet, traveling through the air, tearing, ripping, pain The bullet went straight through his heart.
This was not an accident, Detective!
I don't know how you know that, and I don't give a rat's ass.
This case is personal.
One of my soldiers was killed on my watch.
And I, not you, am going to clean it up.
We clear?
I wouldn't have gone with something as traditional as "we clear"?
You could've gone foreign, right?
Comprende?
Capisc?
Could have had a little fun with it.
You dig my gist, sweetpants?
These are just suggestions.
and to you, the Central Reenactment Committee, I say as of today, the event next weekend is still on, pending an investigation.
Now, most of you are cops.
Should we find any evidence that this was not an accident and do not make an arrest, we will re-evaluate at that time.
Now that said, Detective Lassiter, I want to know how, I want to know who, I want to know why.
Oh, it It's kind of hard to get off.
It takes a long time to unstick the glue.
All right.
Ooh!
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, Chief.
Pending the coroner's report, I'd have to say there are no indications of foul play.
The general consensus is that a live round got mixed in with our blanks.
Mr. Mahoney is the regiment's munitions expert and jeweler, one of Santa Barbara's finest.
He can expand on this.
Mr. Mahoney.
As you know, Detective, we had live-round target practice this past weekend.
Along with you, we assumed a musket ball got stuck in one of our rifles, laid there unseen, and then a blank was inserted during the last rehearsal Poor Nelson.
A terrible, terrible, tragic accident.
The battles meant so much to him.
Anyway, this is an official police investigation.
So let's focus on our schematic and nail down the specifics.
Detective O'Hara, please.
Hey.
What's the deal, why do you keep staring at me?
One.
It's our understanding that the victim was shot off his horse at the top of the creek bank here and then rolled to the creek bed here.
Two.
We know Nelson was facing west, so we're gonna focus our attentions here on the opposite bank where we assume the shot originated.
Assume.
Detective?
Spencer?
What about three, the missing bullet?
I saw it ripping through Nelson's body, in through the front, out through the back.
And it still hasn't been found.
Wait.
How do you know all that?
Lassy, you wanna take this one?
He had an "episode" in the hallway.
Look, I can handle this myself.
Nelson, Nelson, you're going to have to speak up.
You're teeny!
You were shot through the heart?
Now, that was privileged information!
I didn't say anything.
Are you sure about this?
It's bold, but I'll run with it.
He says people don't get shot through the heart by accident.
He says he was murdered.
You're hired.
You told them what?
Gus, she was hot, and she was dressed as a nurse.
You know how I feel about that.
Oh, come on, what was I supposed to do, not impress her?
Plus, the tiny figurine made a very convincing argument.
I don't know how you're gonna prove murder with two lousy bullet holes.
Oh, relax.
I did some checking on Nelson Poe, nobody liked him.
Ever.
And second of all What?
Dude, I don't have a second of all.
And we know Nelson was on top of the ridge, facing the Union soldiers over here when he was shot.
So Schwartz, take Team A, check out that high grass.
O'Hara, take Team B, start going over the ridge.
Do it.
Yes, sir.
Find something amusing?
Mildly amusing.
More odd.
Delightful, in a queer sort ofway.
For your edification, the reenactment of the battles Edification?
Yeah, edification.
Is that legal?
Like, in public.
Public edification's legal?
It means for your information Why didn't you just say that?
For your edification, the reenactment of battles, battles fought by our forefathers to preserve this Union, is a sacred trust.
What are you guys doing here, anyway?
I'm a bit of a Civil War buff.
I'm reading the dirt.
The trees.
The hot dog stand.
No real information there, but they do great sauerkraut.
I may even be able to help you name a suspect.
Look, I told you, we're 95% sure this was an accidental shooting.
What about the other 5%?
If I am wrong, we will hold a press conference, you two will be cordially invited to say "I told you so.
" Seems fair.
Hey Can I wear your face wig?
What are you doing?
Shockingly, Lassiter is holding out on us.
I do not think that he thinks that this was an accident.
What do you mean?
I saw three names checked off the roster on his clipboard.
What names?
Gus, I thought you'd never ask.
What is this?
The battlefield.
Based on what?
The briefing room board at the police station.
You did this from memory?
Yes.
You said you saw it for two minutes.
Right, two whole minutes.
You got problems.
Factoid!
The musket is accurate from 30 yards.
Poe.
G.C. G.C?
George Cheslow.
George Cheslow?
From sixth grade?
Little Georgie!
He's, like, a dentist now.
Really?
See you in six months.
We go in, we check it out.
See if George Cheslow had any reason to murder somebody.
Pop out.
Mr. Guster.
The dentist will see you now.
Sweet.
Whoa!
Me?
My teeth are gorgeous.
You said the appointment was for you.
Right.
For me to do some snooping.
Because I'm a much better snooper than you are.
You just keep him occupied.
Occupied how?
Gus, stop it.
Be a man.
What's he saying?
He says his teeth are gorgeous.
I'm sorry, Shawn, but the reason you have to be here, too, is?
George, Gus has phobias.
And being alone in a dentist chair is one.
He could snap at any moment.
This is actually for your own protection.
Last time he bit off an index finger.
Thankfully, I was there.
They were able to save everything but the nail.
Oops.
Pardonne-moi.
Honey, can I talk to you for a minute?
Oh, sure.
Gentleman, duty calls.
Oh, and the credit card won't go through.
Do you have any cash?
Oh, sure.
I've got tennis, then dinner with Karen.
Okay, I'll hit an ATM, that's Don't wait up if I'm late.
Oh, okay.
All right.
Bye, sweetie.
Good shopping.
Ah, yes.
George, I heard you got married, but, wow, huh?
I know what you're thinking, "What's wrong with this picture"?
But, you know, where is it written that the ugly guy never gets the girl?
Everywhere, man.
Yeah.
No, we're fine.
We're better, you're fine.
Don't worry about it.
Let's see here.
So how is married life treating you these days, George?
Everything Everything solid?
Why are you snooping around here, Shawn?
You think I did this because Erlene was having an affair with Poe?
Huh?
You didn't know.
Of course I knew, George.
I'm a psychic.
It was over, completely over.
I'm beyond it and Erlene's beyond it.
At least, I think she is.
I I had some gauze It's right If I could just Oh, there you go.
Thank you.
George, do you wear your glasses out on the battlefield?
Oh, I want to, but Lassiter won't let me.
He says they're not of the period.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, Gus here doesn't think you did it.
Neither does Shawn.
Well, thanks, guys, I appreciate that.
Oops!
Oops?
Small cavity.
I don't have any cavity in my mouth It's right on the surface.
Don't worry about it.
There we go.
There's my trooper.
Listen, Georgie, nobody's drilled my mouth for anything George?
Why am I surprised?
It is a funny coincidence.
Hey, Jules.
George, I hate to say this, but you're under arrest for the murder of Nelson Poe.
What?
On what grounds?
You said it was an accident.
We discovered a stack of love letters at Nelson's house indicating he was having an affair with your wife and that you had threatened to kill him.
Oh, come on.
I am so disappointed in you.
All right.
Okay, okay, okay.
You got the wrong man.
What did he say?
You've got the wrong man.
First, I told you so.
Secondly, I think George Cheslow is an innocent man.
Yeah, you know, he's right.
We do have a paper-thin case.
I mean, all we've got is motive, means and opportunity.
Look, guys.
I had a dream last night.
I was sipping iced wine with a baby tree monkey.
And I fell and I landed in a wooded area.
And that's where I saw Nelson Poe get shot.
Only, in my dream, the shooter was much closer than I originally thought.
This is a minie ball, am I right?
Where did you get this?
Your desk.
Now, it's common knowledge that minie balls cause huge gaping holes in human flesh which leads to a quandary in my dream.
Why was Nelson Poe's exit wound so small?
If George Cheslow had been in that wooded area, he was way too far to make a shot that caused such a little hole.
Whoever shot Nelson was much, much closer.
And this "whoever" would be Engelbert Humperdinck.
So you've got nothing.
Thank you for the random speculation.
Goodbye.
Mr. Spencer, if you can't name names, I'm afraid he's right this time.
Fine, I'll get you a name.
And I'm gonna get you a woman.
"Afraid he's right"?
"This time"?
It's a gift, actually, for my son.
A surprise of sorts.
This way he, my son, will be able to keep track of time for a change.
Kid was late at birth, he's been late ever since.
Now, he is going to have a gold pocket watch just like mine.
I've had mine for 30 years.
I see.
Now, the inscription.
What would you like it to say?
"Shawn, "don't lose this watch, Henry Spencer.
" Spencer.
What, too much?
No, no.
It's just that your son is no doubt familiar with your last name.
It might contradict the sentiment.
All right, what would you suggest?
"Love, Dad"?
"Love, Dad.
" Well, why don't you just put "Kissy, kissy"?
Right, too mushy.
No problem.
So, before we go any further, let's see.
Vintage gold pocket watch.
Gold chain.
Taxes and engraving, comes to a total of Wait, wait, wait.
Where's my discount?
I'm ex-cop.
Half the regiment's cop.
I thought we agreed on $400.
Oh, yes, we did.
But at $4 per engraved letter, that adds a total of $210.
All right, take away "Shawn," "this watch", "Spencer.
" How much does that come out to?
$56 for the engraving plus tax, $460 even.
And what does the revised inscription read?
"Don't lose, Henry.
" Clean, to the point.
I like it.
Come in.
Mr. Guster, I know you said you didn't want to be interrupted, but there is a Lieutenant Crunch here to see you.
Crunch?
Actually, I've been promoted.
It's Captain Crunch.
Thank you.
Not in a thousand years.
Dude, we're joining that regiment.
No, we are not.
They're down to 30 guys.
Please, I have a meeting in And this mystery is still wide open.
Gus, think about it.
Camping out under the stars.
Living history.
Eating beans and rotten meat with men who reek of valor.
There's just one thing you haven't considered in this perfect scenario of yours, Shawn.
That's not true.
I've considered everything.
Really?
And what role would I play in this production of yours?
I don't What do you What role would I play in the midst of all those hardcore down-to-the-last-detail Civil War re-enactors?
Would I be No.
Gus, no.
Okay, then maybe would I be Never.
Who are you talking to?
You're talking to me.
This is me.
Then what, Shawn?
What would I be?
Because I tell you, there is no way, no way, that I would ever, never ever May I please tell you what I was thinking?
What?
I was thinking Glory.
I was thinking Denzel.
Did you just say Denzel?
As in Denzel Washington?
No, the other Denzel.
Of course.
And we'll put you on a horse, and we'll give you your own sword.
You're gonna have a chestful of medals.
You can be anything you want.
You can be a pilot.
The Air Force wasn't formed until World War I. That's fair.
So you can't be a pilot.
Look, I called Mr. Mahoney, he's Mr. Uniform, and I told him to make you something spectacular.
Denzel Washington.
Captain Mahoney, you said we needed recruits?
Voilá.
Welcome aboard, son.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Don't know if the uniforms are ready yet.
But it is spectacular?
You saw Glory?
This is the best we had.
Well, come along.
I told you.
Wow, Captain, it's quite an establishment you've got here.
My sanctum sanctorum.
Fine jewelry, yes.
Even my vintage pocket watch collection.
But above all, the finest Civil War memorabilia and props west of the Mississippi.
I can attest to that.
I've repaired nearly half of them.
Sally.
I am so happy to see you, though I'm a little disappointed you're not wearing your nurse's uniform.
Griffin called me, frantic, saying we needed one more outfit.
You okay with that?
I sure am.
It's just a shame you didn't dress me.
Still time for that.
Aside from reenacting, Sally insures half the regiment.
Auto policies, homeowners.
Even theft.
Speaking of which, Griff, I'm thinking of insuring my legs.
Sort of like Mary Hart.
What do you think, three, five million a haunch?
Keep in mind my calves are like carved marble.
That's not the kind of policy she writes.
So she wrote yours?
Of course.
And it's worth more than both your legs put together.
Does that policy include plastic explosives?
'Cause I see that you're packing C-4.
Is this authentic?
Better yet, is it even legal?
For the reenactments.
We fudge the fireworks sometimes.
Our audience goes wild every year when the fake cannon fire showers them with dirt.
What do we have here?
C.S. Richmond High Hump.
.
58-caliber percussion loader.
Iron ramrod.
Good Lord, Burton, you are a wonk.
What the heck?
Sorry.
Sorry.
The battlefield can be pretty messy at times.
What about these jars with the buttons in them?
For the super hardcores.
They soak their brass in urine.
You ready to try this thing on?
Sure.
Dude, you look awesome.
Are you sure there's not another uniform?
Yeah.
But, I'm checking with the Ventura Association.
Personally, I think you look dashing.
I always loved the marching band.
It's not so much me as it is Mickelson.
He's good.
Shawn, we're supposed to be roughing it.
Gus, for your edification, they don't have TiVo out here.
Hi, Sally Reynolds.
Keep an eye on those patties.
Shall we?
Let's go somewhere dark.
You can give me a history lesson.
Captain Quantrill, he's the guy that burned down the abolitionist town?
Lawrence, Kansas, 1863.
A year later they were hell-bent on assassinating Lincoln.
But Lassiter's great- great-granddad, Muscum, he stopped 'em cold on the bridge, yeah?
Sort of like a noble calling, right?
Something like that.
And the nurse you portray, who's that?
Jenny Winslow.
She lost her husband and two sons at Lawrence.
She wanted revenge, and she got it.
And what about you, Sally Reynolds?
What do you want?
Shouldn't you already know?
Why, because I'm psychic?
My aunt used to think she was a psychic.
She got predictions wrong all the time.
Then she'd get the smallest random detail right, and she'd say, "You see"?
So, what you're saying is that you doubt me?
That hurts my feelings.
Well, you still haven't guessed what I want.
Damn it!
Shawn?
What happened?
Gus.
I know how Nelson Poe was killed.
Good morning, Father.
Good morning, Your Highness.
I lost your pocket watch.
The truth, Shawn, you're not really my son, are you?
Because I gave you a watch with the inscription "Don't lose.
" And what is the first thing that you do?
I lose the watch.
You lose the watch!
Well, here's a news flash, Dad.
My birthday wasn't yesterday, okay?
It was four months ago.
Yeah, well, here's a newsflash for you, kid.
After you were born, it took you four months to smile at me.
That's when the clock started ticking.
Look, Shawn, I appreciate this newfound respect that you've got for time, but what the hell are you doing out here in the boonies with an antique gold pocket watch?
I don't know, trying to clear an innocent man named George Cheslow?
It's a button.
All right, look, this case of yours, I I've been thinking about it and Really?
What?
No, I haven't been "thinking.
" Look, killing your wife's lover is something that's rarely planned.
It usually just happens.
So even if this dentist Cheslow did plan it, he's not gonna be some numb nuts hanging around waiting for love letters that're gonna point the cops in his direction, right?
Exactly.
He's not gonna hang around like a numb nuts.
So here's the deal.
I think Nelson rolled into this creek and was shot from that tree right up there.
And you figured this out last night when you fell on your ass down here by yourself.
Right on my ass.
Now all I need to do is find the missing bullet.
And how and where do we find this missing bullet?
How about right here?
Shawn, what about the watch?
You mean this watch?
Hey, I needed a metal detector.
Target was out of stock.
And you won't let anyone use yours, so Hey, I found the bullet.
Well, hey, you didn't find the killer, did you?
You need to find the killer.
Hell of an exit.
P.S., you look like an idiot.
I am warning you, he'd better not be wasting my time.
Honestly, Detective, I've never seen him so excited before.
"Four score and seven years ago " Shawn!
"Ask not what your country can do for you " Shawn!
" but what you can do for " Gus?
Is that you?
Shawn!
Yellow!
All I see is yellow.
Yellow and the number two.
I'm already getting a bad feeling here.
There's lead.
No, graphite.
Fine, I'll play.
A pencil?
Yes, a yellow pencil.
You see a yellow pencil?
Yes.
Where?
I'm not sure.
Please, help me, Detective, please.
A little to your left.
Back to your right.
Oh, you are getting warm, you are so warm!
Oh, gosh!
You're burning up!
How can you stand that?
Great, you found a pencil.
Now we can all take the SATs.
There's more.
The evidence, the critical evidence, it's there, just look closer.
Look closer.
That's it.
Gus.
That's it.
That's the bullet that killed Poe.
And I bet when I run it through ballistics, it's gonna match George Cheslow's musket.
No, you're wrong, it's not Cheslow.
O'Hara.
Yeah.
We're on our way.
It's a 439 in progress.
Four thirty-nine?
Yeah.
We gotta go.
Wait, I was I'm not finished!
There's more!
E- mail me!
Juliet!
I found the bullet!
I Should we go?
No.
No.
Let's run through this from the killer's point ofview.
Okay, Nelson was shot from up here.
Let's do a list.
Okay.
One.
The killer climbs the tree, like so.
Right.
Two?
He gets ready to shoot from here.
Three.
Three.
Nelson rolls down the creek, way past his mark.
Four.
Looks up, sees the bad guy.
Okay, which means Nelson wasn't the original target!
Bingo.
He interrupted the plan.
Okay, look up there and see if you see a notch.
You know, that would steady a gun.
A notch.
Yeah, like a notch.
It should lead us to the intended target.
That's not a notch.
That's a notch.
The hospital tent.
Dude, I think I got it.
What?
Sally Reynolds.
Sally Reynolds?
Sally Reynolds.
Why would someone want to kill Sally Reynolds?
I have no idea.
Folks, our Civil War re-enactment has begun.
Hey, what's up, guys?
You're going to get a call from a very irate Sally Reynolds saying two guys just drove by and stole her dress.
Just ignore it, okay?
What the hell are you guys doing?
Sally was the target.
Shawn's gonna put on that dress and wait for someone to shoot him.
Right, but the plan sounds a lot better when you don't say it like that.
Listen, Detective, we have reason to believe that the intended target was Sally Reynolds.
Now, we've stolen her dress and we're gonna catch the yellow-bellied son of a bitch red-handed.
I forced the ending, that's horrible.
So, risking getting shot is the only way to solve the case?
Absolutely.
Then we should stop the battle.
No, we can't.
It's too late.
They're gonna start in less than a minute.
Listen, Juliet, please let us go?
I can't let you do that.
You're a civilian.
It's too dangerous.
It's fine.
We'll spot the guy well before he gets a shot off.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
What?
Juliet?
Charge!
Careful, Gus!
Sorry!
Just take a deep breath.
Okay.
I don't think these dresses were intended to fit over a bulletproof vest.
Remember, we will be out there watching.
Got you.
To catch the bad guy before you get shot.
I understand.
But just in case, I want you to bob left, weave right.
Traditional bob and weave, no reason to get fancy out there.
And don't become an easy target.
I did go to the academy.
Or you could die.
Right.
Now remember, the fifth cannon boom is your cue to shoot whoever's playing Quantrill.
Right.
Wait, how do you know that?
I read the manual.
Didn't you?
I didn't open the manual, it was like War and Peace.
There were 17 chapters.
It's the manual, Shawn.
It was this thick  Hey.
Hey.
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
All about you right now.
All right, you're a champion.
Now go out there and catch us a killer.
Juliet, please be careful.
And don't die.
How many times you gonna say die?
Shawn, just get You're putting the word "die" into her head.
She knows there's a killer!
Guys?
Yeah?
A favor.
Sure!
Name it.
Kick me.
Do what?
Kick me!
Okay!
Now what?
Now we get ready to find a killer.
Here it comes.
The moment of truth.
Where's our killer?
That's weird.
Nobody came.
Well, at least Juliet is out of danger now.
What?
Well, I wonder where this leads.
Watch your head.
Oh, did you get sewage on your feather?
We've crossed to the other side of the creek bed.
Yeah, the police accounted for all of the Union soldiers.
But nobody's considered that the murderer could have come from this side.
After all, this was the bad side, right?
You know that's right.
May I ask, who goes out on the battlefield without their boots?
Maybe someone has bunions.
Bunions, Gus?
Really?
That's what you're bringing to the table?
I'm trying to solve a murder here.
I deal with bunions at work every day, Shawn.
They hurt They hurt people.
That's a perfectly logical assumption.
Oh, yeah?
What about this?
No tunic.
This is Mahoney's!
What?
The brass button.
Mahoney did it.
That's why he had that sticky musket.
He must've gotten sap on it from that notch in the tree.
Wait.
This doesn't track.
Why kill Sally?
She's hot, they're friends.
She even wrote his insurance policy.
That was C-4!
That didn't come from the battlefield, it came from the south.
I solved the crime.
No, I did.
I said it first.
I identified the uniform.
I found the button near the tree.
I said it first.
Tap, tap, no take-backs.
That's not fair, Shawn.
I was identifying the C-4 sound.
Dude, you snooze you lose, Gus.
I don't have to tell you.
That manhole we found connects to the sewer.
It's going to lead us right to our killer.
Let's go.
We're going in by ourself?
What, are you crazy?
Where you going, Mahoney?
Hey, Griff!
Hello, boys.
Back off.
Back off.
Back off.
This gun is loaded.
Yes, but mine are so much bigger.
Get out of the way, I'm coming through.
What the hell is going on down here?
Colonel, arrest this traitor.
I'll have that weapon, Captain.
Okay, hold on, I'm gonna need you to walk me through this.
Mahoney blew up his own vault?
That is an absolutely outrageous Shut up!
Not only did he blow it up, he used the battle as a cover to rob his own store.
Then, he'd collect a multi - million dollar insurance policy in a couple ofweeks, then slip back to the battle during the cannon fire with no one ever being the wiser.
Oh, ye immoral man of low fiber!
You should really eat more bran.
I want to see my lawyer.
In due time.
Wait, but I still don't understand.
Why kill Nelson Poe?
That is the rub, isn't it?
Sally Reynolds was the intended target.
The question is why?
Hi, Juliet.
Got your message.
What the hell is going on?
Oh, I can see it clearly now.
Sally wrote Mahoney's multi-million dollar insurance policy.
That means she She was in on the fraud from the start.
That's a lie.
But Mahoney here didn't want to share those millions, so he gets an idea.
What if sweet, sweet Sally with the filthy mouth and the bedroom eyes had a little accident out on the battlefield during the rehearsal?
You mean Griffin tried to kill me?
That's right.
This is a lie.
You are fabricating everything you're saying.
Now you hold on a second, Mr. Mahoney.
Oh, hey, Gus, you see, when Nelson rolled down the creek bed and landed too close to the river, he looked up and he saw Griffin in the tree with his trusty musket, who said, "Griffin, now you must kill Nelson Poe "to keep his stinking mouth shut.
" Told you you had the wrong person, Lassiter.
I know.
Detective O'Hara Lose the hoop skirt before you hurt someone.
Read 'em their rights and book ' em.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Hey, it was good work, Detective.
We got 'em.
"We"?
We're a team, right?
Gus.
When we grow up, think I'll ever be as cool as you?
You're better at kickball.
Not what I asked.
We talking about your dad again?
Mmm-hmm.
Come on, dude.
The guy respects you.
Not like he does you.
I'm not his son.
I mean, he might like me okay, but he loves you.
Did he say that?
No.
Then how can you be sure?
You mean he's never said it?
Come on, Gus.
We're guys.
Charge!
Charge!
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
You're dead, Spencer.
What you doing, Shawn?
Nothing.
Looks like something to me.
Okay.
I was running away from Ryan Brickhouse.
That him?
Mmm-hmm.
Is he the same kid who's been hassling you all week?
Yeah.
Why is he chasing you today?
I might have thrown a rock at him.
Did you hit him?
Almost.
Get back out there.
What?
You can't run away from the bad guys forever, Shawn.
Eventually, you got to come up with a new approach.
So?
So, find one.
You're flunking math?
Probably.
Here's the deal.
Leave me alone, I'll make sure you ace the test tomorrow.
How?
Every third answer is "C".
There's a pattern to all our tests.
Mrs. Bodansky does it every time.
I memorized it.
I'll show you.
You better not be lying.
Not bad.
You faced your fears.
You got a new result.
You came out ahead.
Did you really memorize those test answers?
Yeah.
Who are you calling?
Your math teacher.
No, no, no, no, no.
Yes.
Yes.
Nickel.
That's a nickel.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Who is that?
Who is who?
The girl sitting in our front desk.
Ah, you're talking about the lovely Dagmar.
Dagmar?
She's our new receptionist.
How did she get the job?
Agency sent her over.
You contacted a temp agency without consulting me?
Gus, anyone can get a secretary from a temp agency.
It takes real foresight and creativity to get one from a modeling agency.
A modeling agency?
Wow.
Now, why would a beautiful lady like that want to be our secretary?
Oh, that's a bit of a story, you see.
Apparently, she got it in her head that this was a runway gig.
I blame the agent.
I was very clear on the phone.
But she's cool with sticking around for the rest of the day and seeing how it goes.
You know how slow it gets when it's not modeling season.
Does she answer the phone?
Yes.
But only her cell phone.
She's expecting a call from Milan.
Does she file?
Mostly her nails.
Coffee?
Yes, she wants some.
Can I make you anything?
No.
Dude, I thought you weren't coming in till, like, noon.
Big drama at the office today.
A doctor we supply product to got killed.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You didn't call me immediately?
You don't know him.
Gus, this is what we do.
Remember?
We can solve the case.
The police are already there.
This means nothing to me.
They're going to need help, guidance, psychic vibrations.
Dagmar?
She doesn't speak English?
Does she need to?
Where in the name of all that is holy is my forensics team?
All right, what can you tell me about this doctor that I can pretend to ascertain from the spirit world?
Dr. Blinn wasn't on my route.
I did cover him a few times.
All I remember is he always made you wait and he had a picture of Pete Rose on his wall.
Look how cute she is in the fuchsia.
I have been sent by the spirit of Pete Rose.
Pete Rose isn't dead.
There was a photo of Pete Rose on the wall.
Okay, why have I been drawn here?
Was there a murder?
Do I need the little booties for the crime scene?
Thanks, but we're doing just fine.
Don't go in the back room.
My grandpa loved Pete Rose.
All right, I want you guys ringing doorbells.
If anybody in the neighborhood saw anything, I want to know about it.
Patient files.
Cabinet's locked.
We haven't found the key.
Get ahold of the DA's office.
Tell him I need access to those files.
If they say we need a warrant, get it.
Also, get me a copy of his desk calendar.
I thought I told you no.
But your eyes said yes.
Hey, who's that Cincinnati Red over there with the bowl cut?
Let me be perfectly clear.
This is my crime scene.
I don't need your help.
I don't want your help.
If you don't leave right now, I will have you arrested for interfering with a police investigation.
Am I clear?
Like butter.
I've given this a great deal of thought.
I think we should take the rest of the day off.
What say you?
All we've done is eat up a box of animal cookies and crash a crime scene.
The case with the doctor.
They're coming back to us eventually.
You know this.
So, let's go to the beach.
It's too nice a day for murder and mayhem.
I have to see him right now.
It's important.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to barge in, but I need help.
Mr. Dunn, Robert, how can we help?
And can I call you Bob?
This is difficult.
Take your time.
We're here.
Yeah.
I'm just gonna come out and say it.
I'm being haunted.
Haunted?
Yes.
Haunting?
He's crazy.
Gus, can I talk to you outside?
Not now, Shawn.
We're in the middle of something.
Gus.
Stop talking.
Sit down.
Now, what exactly do you mean when you say, haunted?
Well, my home, sometimes I smell perfume when no one else is around.
Things get broken or move.
Oh, Gus, I think you have a text message.
I'll get it later.
I think you should get it now.
Sorry.
Work business.
Okay.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do these spirits ever speak to you?
No.
No.
Whatever, whoever it is, it hasn't spoken to me.
Oh.
Have you contacted the police?
Yeah.
But they said that there was nothing they could do.
So, here I am.
Robert, we deal with this kind of phenomenon all the time.
What you need to realize is that evicting a spirit is a very time-consuming and absurdly expensive process.
I don't care, okay?
I just can't go on living this way.
Excuse me.
Oh, really?
Yes!
Yes, Shawn.
Look, all I'm saying is that it might be easier to try moving into a different house, one that's less haunted.
I've tried that.
Whatever this thing is, it followed me all the way from San Francisco.
Maybe it likes you.
No, I don't think so.
What makes you say that?
I think it tried to kill me.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Gus, what is all this?
Gear we might need.
If we're going to be hunting spirits, we might as well do it right.
Methodically, systematically, scientifically.
Who knows, we might be surprised what we find.
Video camera?
Nice.
Audio recorder, motion detectors.
Gus, I'm very impressed.
You only forgot one thing.
Really?
What?
There's no such thing as ghosts.
Yes, there is.
Oh, Gus, no.
Okay.
Stop.
Please.
Let's just, let's just stop.
Come here, sit down.
Please, sit.
All right, this is me talking.
This is Shawn.
What's going on?
I usually to have to drag you to these cases, kicking and screaming, and those are real police cases.
Now, all of a sudden we have some client who's either bonkers or, judging by the size of the bags under his eyes, suffering from nothing more than waking dreams or hallucinations and you, you're ready to go ghost-hunting.
Talk to me.
All right.
All right.
I never told this to anyone before, but I was 12.
Gus, it's me.
It was late.
I was in my room with the lights off.
I heard a voice.
Gus, I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation.
No, no, no, Shawn.
It wasn't on TV and it wasn't a radio.
It was coming from the walls.
And the voice, the voice told me that our house was built on an old Indian burial ground.
Shut up.
And she said She said she was sad because she had died many moons ago and was trapped between worlds.
When I asked her her name, Shawn, she said, "My name " "My name is Wilting Flower.
"I died without knowing love.
"Will you be my friend"?
How did you know that?
I never told that to anyone before.
I was Wilting Flower.
Gus!
I can't believe that you fell for that.
I put an old walkie-talkie in the wall when your dad put in the new insulation.
The old Indian burial ground, you bought that?
I got that from Poltergeist or Poltergeist II.
Gremlins?
No, it wasn't Gremlins.
That's not funny, Shawn.
You know what?
Let's add a "Trixie" to that.
She is the companion to "Scrappy", right?
Okay, great.
Let's add that to Girl With Flowers and Merry Musicians.
Okay, now listen, I need the card to read, "Happy birthday.
"'Ex' is the loneliest letter in the alphabet.
" But I need you to spell it, E- X, as in Oh, you got it.
Okay, well, see, it continues, "From your not yet 'ex', E- X, husband, "Carlton.
" Perfect.
These will go out today, right?
All righty-dighty.
Thank you very much.
I didn't know you collected figurines.
You know, I have a grandmother Do you not knock?
There's no door.
And?
Sorry.
The DA's office called.
They said that we can have access to Dr. Blinn's patients' files.
About time.
Let's go get in there, get those addresses.
Bring these nut jobs in for questioning.
Here's where I found all my paintings last weekend upside down.
I've got a cold spot.
Right here.
Feel it?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Robert, we've definitely got something here.
You're standing under a vent.
So, all these are yours, huh?
Yeah.
I'm trying to get ready for a show.
No kidding.
Has anything strange ever happened here?
Sometimes I get the feeling that the furniture has been moved.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Did you actually see it happen?
No, no, I just come into a room and everything's not where I left it.
Robert, do you have a photo album?
Yeah.
Ah.
Hmm.
That's a nice shot, huh?
I feel it!
I feel it.
Oh, Gus, Gus, oh!
Oh!
She is angry!
She is angry!
She is soaring!
With rage and She wants to go to the bedroom!
Where's the bedroom?
It's here!
Here!
Take me!
Oh!
I've lost her.
You don't believe me, do you?
No, no, of course we do.
You saw it, too, didn't you?
Guys, please, stay the night.
Then you'll see.
I mean, you don't know what it's been like.
I can't work.
I can't concentrate.
I wake up in the morning more tired than when I went to bed.
Days pass when I can't remember what I've done This pulls out into a bed, but that's all I got.
Oh, no worries.
What's a little spooning between old pals, huh, Gus?
Well, good night.
Good night, Robert.
You got the floor.
Oh, we'll make it work.
You don't mind if I nude up for the sleepover, right?
Seriously, Shawn, only one of us is sleeping at a time.
The other one is on watch.
Oh, no, we'll both sleep.
I'll put on some socks, make you feel more comfortable.
Stop playing, Shawn.
We're here to solve a case.
I already solved it.
When?
When you were flapping a book like a bird?
Gus, if you must know, it was a bald eagle.
And, yes.
You found the ghost?
There's no such thing as ghosts.
Yes, there is, Shawn.
No, there isn't, but there is such thing as a pissed off ex-girlfriend.
What ex-girlfriend?
No one mentioned anything about an ex.
You didn't look at the photo album?
Redhead.
She's cute.
What makes you think she's an ex?
Oh, come on, there's dirty dishes everywhere.
His bedroom is a mess, his nails are filthy, his hair is horrible.
No girlfriend is gonna put up with that.
And, exhibit A, who else would "X" through his face in all these pictures?
Okay.
Okay, say she's the ex, we still don't know if she's actually been here.
There are strands of red hair all over the studio.
Should we tell Robert?
How psychic would that be?
No, we'll spend the night.
It's fine.
Catch up with the ex tomorrow.
Talk to her, see what's going on.
Meanwhile, I'm going to do some sit-ups.
Come hold my feet.
I'm going to do a thousand.
Shawn!
Get up!
Fire!
Get Robert!
I could have died.
Ifyou guys weren't here, I Why is it doing this to me?
Why is it trying to kill me?
Okay.
Okay, Robert, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, Bobby, look at me.
Now, who here has communicated with more dispossessed souls, you or me?
You?
That's correct.
Now, I am telling you that this, this fire was not an attempt on your life.
It wasn't?
No.
This was a sad and desperate cry for help from a very frightened, very lonely apparition.
Are you sure about this?
Absolutely.
Of course it's also possible that someone simply left a candle burning.
I don't burn candles.
Gus, did you burn a candle?
Why would I do that?
Cry for help it is.
No one came in while we were sleeping.
I checked the doors and windows.
They were all locked from the inside.
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's all you did?
Checked the doors and the windows?
Yeah, why?
Where did that come from?
Don't look at me.
I'm not wearing lipstick.
This is the only post office box listed for Regina Kane.
According to Dr. Blinn's calendar, she was his last appointment.
She might have seen something.
I want to find her.
Well, if this is where she picks up her mail, she probably lives close by.
Canvas the neighborhood, see if anyone knows her.
That's a really smart approach.
What?
That, that shocks you?
I meant that as a compliment.
Really?
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Was that sarcastic?
No.
Oh.
Okay.
You're welcome.
Do you still think it's the ex-girlfriend?
A woman scorned is a woman with motive.
We need to talk to this woman.
You're on your own.
I'm tied up with work for the rest of the week.
Gus, that's so lame.
Pull over.
Good morning, detectives.
Collecting donations for the Policeman's Ball?
We don't have balls.
I honestly have no response to that.
Need I remind you, Mr. Spencer, what happens when you interfere with a police investigation?
The case gets solved?
Wait a minute, you guys are working on that murder thingy, right?
I completely forgot about that.
How's that going?
Silly question.
We'll let you guys get back to your investigating.
Bye, Juliet.
Okay, where to next?
Listen, we change our clothes, we get some lunch, then I have to get back to work.
Gus, the plot is thickening.
Shawn, I've already missed two days this week.
Oh, fine, fine, fine.
I respect your wishes.
Thank you.
Jerk chicken.
You know that's right.
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
There he is.
What time is it?
Daytime.
What happened?
I might have dropped six allergy pills in your frosty while you were peeing.
You did what?
Where are we?
Palo Alto.
San Francisco?
No, but close.
Robert's ex-girlfriend lives up here, Gus, and we really need to talk to her.
I will kill you, Shawn.
And then you're going to buy me some new tires.
Oh, come on.
This is fun.
Road trip.
Kidnapping.
That's exactly what this is.
That's it.
We're not talking.
What, seriously?
So, we're really not talking now?
Come on, how mature is this?
The silent treatment is not how conflict gets resolved, Gus.
We need to work through this, we need to share our feelings, maybe a smoothie.
Yes?
Never mind.
It's not her.
Pardon me.
What do I mean, "It's not her"?
Lips.
The lips don't match.
The lips that kissed your forehead do not belong to Amy Kessler.
Therefore, she's not our ghost.
"You didn't drive all the way out here so you could say, 'It's not her' and leave.
"We're talking to hep.
" "Her.
" "Carlton, "separation means apart.
" What you got there?
Nothing.
Are you okay?
Of course I'm okay.
You look sad.
I am sad.
Why are you sad?
I'm sad because I don't have my forensics report on my dead doctor.
Or a lead on my possible witness, Regina Kane.
What about that psychic guy?
Isn't Shawn great at this sort of thing?
Finding people.
I mean, maybe we should bring him Maybe you should just keep your ideas to yourself.
That's a joke, right?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Okay.
Very nice.
Exquisite brush strokes.
It's a print.
I'm referring, of course, to the original.
I'm sorry, what's the name of your gallery again?
That's been a bit of a problem, actually.
We wanted to call it Le Petit Louvre, but apparently the art snobs in France think they have a monopoly on all things Louvre.
We also tried Louvre Two, Louvre, Junior, Night Gallery, nothing cleared.
The important thing is we want to show the amazing work of Robert Dunn and he listed you as a character reference.
Oh, we are very select with the clients that we take on, isn't that right, Francois?
I have to admit, I'm surprised Robert would list me as a character reference.
We dated for a period and it didn't end well.
Can I ask why?
Not to pry, but he did list you as a reference.
The usual, forgetting dates, standing me up, sometimes he'd get so wrapped up in his work he'd disappear for days at a time.
The worst was when he cheated on me and lied about it.
Oh.
You must have been burning with furious anger.
He was just so stupid.
A girlfriend of mine saw him at a club with another woman.
He was drunk and pretended that she had him confused with someone else.
He said his name was, get this, Martin Brody.
Martin Brody?
Roy Scheider's character from Jaws?
Yes.
How did you know?
I've seen Jaws.
It's his favorite movie.
Anyway, when I asked him about it, he pretended he'd never even heard of the club.
That's horrible.
You must have wanted to kill him.
Probably not so much anymore.
You're pretty happily engaged, aren't you?
Yes.
Isn't the ring great?
Okay, so she's not our ghost.
Even the longest journeys can start with a tiny misstep.
Overall, still a very good day.
How is it a good day?
Oh, come on, Gus.
First of all, road trip, always fun.
We got some fresh-baked sourdough, very nice.
And the agency is sending us a new secretary tomorrow.
And yes, she speaks English fluently.
Shawn, we talked about this.
We can't afford a receptionist.
I don't think we can afford not to have one.
Gus?
What?
I think maybe we should move.
Come on, Gus!
Get it in gear!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Hey!
Hey!
Guy's like a Whippet.
Tell me about it.
What's the supersmeller say?
Somebody had too much to drink.
What are you so happy for?
We almost got killed.
This was not an accident.
Whoever that is was waiting for us and we have a new suspect for Robert's ghost.
He didn't answer his phone.
Maybe he's not home.
Robert?
Or maybe whoever tried to kill us last night also paid Robert a visit.
And left the door unlocked.
Anybody home?
Robert?
Bob?
Shawn, you might want to see this.
"Save me.
I'm trapped.
" Hmm.
I don't want to jump to conclusions here, but this very well may be a cry for help.
Maybe someone died here.
Or was buried alive.
This could be the cry of a tortured soul.
So this guy just happens to move into two haunted houses in a row?
Don't touch that.
It's blood.
It's not blood.
Enjoy your hepatitis.
And this tortured soul might be less tortured with a latex enamel.
He wouldn't get these messy drips.
Now what?
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
Hallelujah.
Wow.
What?
You got to see this.
Huh.
Not what I was expecting.
Okay, I know what I'm looking at, but what does it mean?
Is it a ghost?
No, buddy, it's not a ghost.
Is there a woman living up here?
Well, that would certainly explain the perfume Robert's been smelling and all the red hair laying everywhere, but no, no dice.
Then, what is it?
Oh, come on, Gus.
Look.
What?
Robert is a woman.
No, he's not.
Not all the time, but sometimes.
No.
Doesn't seem like the type.
He's not the type.
Then how?
Unless he has that personality thing.
What personality thing?
Oh, you know what I'm talking about.
The multiple personality disease.
You know, that what's her name had, The Flying Nun in the other thing, the TV movie.
Smokey and the Bandit?
Yeah, dude, Smokey and the Bandit.
Yes.
What does that have to do with multiple personalities?
You asked.
I asked a real question.
You were supposed to give me a real answer, not a random guess.
Okay.
Fine.
Hooper.
Hooper?
Hooper.
Hooperwas a stuntman.
Oh.
I don't think Sally Field is even in Hooper.
Who are you thinking of?
Oh Terry Bradshaw.
Yes.
Is it Norma Rae?
No, but that would have made that movie a lot cooler.
The thing you asked about Shawn, is referred to as dissociative identity disorder.
That's it!
That's what Robert has, Gus.
It all makes sense.
Do you know how rare that is?
I'm not saying all of Santa Barbara has it, just Robert.
One guy.
I think that qualifies as pretty rare.
I don't know, Shawn.
These are huge.
Look.
Think about it.
There's two separate, but distinct personalities, one body.
One's a man, the other's a woman.
The female personality cooks dinner.
Robert thinks the meals are the work of a ghost.
The female rearranges the furniture.
Robert thinks the ghost is moving things when he's not around.
His old girlfriend did say that he would disappear for stretches at a time, which would explain when the female personality was in control, Robert would disappear.
And he would have no clue to any of it.
Now, all we need to figure out is how to bring out the woman so that we can talk to her.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Triggers.
We shoot him?
Then what?
No, no, sights, sounds, smells.
Something that would trigger the personality to come out.
Triggers it is.
Gus, this is going to be kind of cool.
Or weird.
Where did all this stuff come from?
Is this where she lives?
The angry female spirit that you sensed?
Oh, yes.
I feel her very strongly here, Robert.
Do you?
Do you feel pretty?
What?
Do you feel pretty?
He means do you feel a female presence?
No, but I'm not a psychic.
Do you think that you can communicate with her?
I'm trying.
I am.
Sorry.
Okay.
You guys are starting to creep me out.
So, if I'm not needed, I think I'll go back downstairs.
Okay.
Let me just put this away.
We'll all go down together.
You coming, Shawn?
Yes.
Oh, wow, Robert, these are some terrific clothes.
I bet they look absolutely beautiful on you, Regina.
Regina?
Who Who are you talking to?
Yes.
Yes, Gus, why don't you tell Regina how much you like her nice clothes.
Wow.
Yeah, Regina.
Regina.
You look beautiful.
Regina?
Regina?
Thank you, Gus.
I can't tell you how glad I am that you got my message.
So, do you think that you can help me?
Please.
Dude.
This isn't right.
I must look horrible.
No.
Not at all.
You are too kind.
But then again, I already knew that the way you comforted Robert.
You are so sweet.
Unlike most men, afraid to show their emotions.
I've been hurt a lot.
Now if you two don't mind, I really must put on my face.
Wow.
So, Regina, this message on the wall, this was your way of trying to get Robert's attention?
Well, he doesn't even know I'm alive.
Why not write him a letter?
Or an e-mail?
Even a post-it even?
I tried.
I really did try.
But every time, something or someone stopped you.
What are you talking about?
I think there's another personality.
Regina, there's another personality, isn't there?
I mean, you don't smash pictures or start fires.
You would never strangle Robert.
No, I wouldn't.
Regina, the police would like to speak with you.
They're investigating Dr. Blinn's murder.
They think you might have seen something.
You could be in danger.
I didn't see anything.
I didn't even go to my appointment.
Why would anyone want to hurt Dr. Blinn?
He was such a nice man and he was doing so much to help me.
With what?
Well, you ought to know better than to ask that.
That's between a woman and her doctor.
Okay.
Unless you're going to ask her out, I think we're done here.
How do we get Robert back?
I have no idea.
Well, you're her very special friend.
Regina?
We would like to speak with Robert.
Can you let Robert come out and play?
For you, of course I can.
Thank you.
And I do hope that we meet again.
Robert.
Robert?
Robert.
Try Bob.
Easy, easy, easy, easy.
We know it seems weird and Actually, it is.
Yeah.
It's really weird.
But we have good news.
We figured out who your ghost is.
Who?
You.
You're haunting yourself.
Yep.
Life is good.
Life is great.
I mean, Robert gets the help he so desperately needs, we get to marinate in the delicious satisfaction of another job well done.
And leading Lassiter to Regina, even though she saw nothing.
That's professional courtesy.
Plus it helps raise our stock, Gus.
Crime scene photos.
Love crime scene photos.
May I help you?
Detective O'Hara, what a truly pleasant surprise.
Mmm-hmm.
I just dropped by to tell Detective Lassiter that I have We have information regarding the whereabouts of a one, Regina Kane.
How did you know about it?
Never mind.
Stay right here.
Don't move.
I'll go find him.
Ooh.
Shawn.
Shawn, don't do this.
Look at this.
Look at this.
Look!
Look!
Look!
Here, on the floor where poor Dr. Blinn's body was laying.
A toothpick.
A chewed toothpick.
Yeah?
So?
Don't you remember?
The car that tried to ram us, on the seat?
Chewed toothpick.
Oh!
Oh!
That means the person that killed Dr. Blinn is the same person that tried to kill us.
It's a chewed toothpick, Shawn.
Lots of people chew toothpicks.
Yes, but we were working for Robert.
Robert is also Regina.
Regina is a patient of Dr. Blinn.
Yes!
Take the baton!
So, whoever the killer is knew both Robert and Regina.
He said his name was, get this, Martin Brody.
How dumb is that?
Oh!
Martin Brody.
Of course!
That's Robert's other personality.
The violent one.
But, why would he kill Dr. Blinn?
Depends entirely on what Regina was seeing him for.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
What?
Dr. Blinn's patient files.
All we have to do is find Regina's.
What are you doing?
Hmm?
What are you doing?
Shooting.
It relaxes me.
Shawn Spencer says he has information for you.
Where is he?
At your desk.
Is anyone watching him?
Found it!
Oh, no.
What?
Gender reassignment?
Oh, Regina started feeling like a woman trapped in a man's body, so she wants to have her parts Oh, my Wait a second.
That means if Regina was successful, both Robert and the Martin personality would also lose their parts.
Martin can't do anything to hurt Regina because he would only be hurting himself.
So, dressed as Regina, he goes after Dr. Blinn.
That would explain how Robert got the marks on his neck.
And with Dr. Blinn dead, Robert figured that Regina would change her mind about the gender reassignment.
Right.
We got that, Shawn!
Only she hasn't.
Gus, no, no, she found another doctor.
She's seeing him today.
When?
Right now.
Right now, Shawn?
Like, in 10 minutes.
Oh, okay.
There had better be a really good explanation for this.
He was in some sort of trance.
I couldn't control him.
He says this is the killer.
The killer, he's going to kill again.
This is ridiculous.
Who?
Who's he going to kill?
What is it, Shawn?
Watch out!
Watch out!
Oh!
Dr. Drake?
Gender reassignment?
That's a big step, Regina.
Why don't you tell me why it's important to you?
It's okay.
The machine can get that.
This is your time.
Thank you, Dr. Drake.
No answer.
Just the machine.
We have to go now.
It could already be too late.
Let's go!
I know this can be a difficult process, but it really is necessary to ensure that you're ready psychologically for a change like this.
You do seem like an excellent candidate for the surgery.
Our time is up.
Why don't we pick up here again next week?
Okay, Regina?
Okey-dokey.
Only my name is not Regina.
Hold it!
Get up!
What's going on?
Robert?
Bob?
You back there, buddy?
What am I doing here?
Great.
Thanks.
Good news.
They're going to admit Robert into the HT Windsor Facility in Chicago.
And his doctor thinks his prognosis is good.
Don't you understand, Shawn?
That's the premier mental health hospital in the country.
That's good.
That's awesome.
Who is that?
Leslie.
Oh.
Oh.
No, no, no, no.
Leslie's supposed to be a swimsuit model.
Unfortunately, he is.
Although, he says he's getting completely sick of the grind.
I have to call the agency.
They're completely misrepresenting their clientele.
Leslie's a guy's name, too.
Okay.
We have to fire him.
Fire him?
On what grounds?
What grounds?
On the grounds that he's a dude.
That's discrimination.
We can't do that.
Okay, listen to me.
No woman is going to look at us twice if we're sharing our office with that ridiculous Adonis.
He's better looking than both of us put together.
Yeah.
I'm not doing that.
But, Gus, you know I can't fire people.
They look too sad.
This was your idea.
Figure it out.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than Hey.
Where did these comics come from?
Gus, right?
Come here.
Well, at least you're not a tattletale.
What's the big deal?
All the kids read them.
Yeah, well, all the kids don't live in this house, and all the kids don't have a police officer as a father, Shawn.
So what?
So, these things make cops look like idiots who'd rather flash a signal in the sky than do real police work.
They set a bad example.
They do not.
Shawn, don't argue with me.
Do you have any idea of how many kids' brains I have to scoop up off the driveway because they think they can fly?
Those kids are dumb.
Shawn, these things are a fantasy.
Real heroes do not wear a cape and they don't wear their underwear on the outside.
The guys who wear capes They're on angel dust.
Come here.
You want to know what a real hero is?
What?
He's flesh and blood.
He wears a badge.
He lays it on the line every time he walks the beat.
Shawn, do you really want to be a hero someday?
Yes, sir.
Become a cop.
Get your head out of the clouds.
All right, let's see if we can make this thing useful somehow, huh?
Hit the showers.
Somebody needs a hot oil massage.
Pardon?
Stress?
Tough day at the office?
Who are you kidding?
You'll probably never get those reports typed.
Who is this?
Shawn.
Spencer.
Great, you were already thinking about me.
You know, you should roll your head both directions if you really want that to work.
Okay, where are you?
On the phone.
Where are you?
You know damn well where I am.
How can you see me?
Do you really want to know?
I don't ask questions I don't want to know the answer to.
Then never ask a boyfriend if he thinks your sister's hot.
I don't have a sister.
How about a boyfriend?
Where are you?
Well, there's a spectral plane where all of our auras are visible, see.
When a soul is tortured or stressed, like yourself Okay, never mind.
You asked.
You know what, Shawn?
I have a really hectic day today.
The chief, she's Out of the office.
Going to a seminar on non-lethal weaponry with Lassiter?
Out of town?
She sort of left you in charge?
Okay, psychic.
Give me the details.
How did you figure that out?
Most of it is in her day planner.
You cannot be in the chief's office.
Oh, come on.
She's not going to know.
Notice how no one ever looks in here?
Why is that?
What are you guys so afraid of?
It's not like the belly bites.
She's actually a pretty kick-back lady if you give her a chance.
Look what she's done with this place, it's really warm in here.
I know I can't stay away.
And have you tried this chair?
Okay, you have five seconds to get your butt out of Actually, you know what?
Stay right there.
Ooh, indecisive.
I like that.
Take a look at that.
Tell me what you think.
Flower doodle in the upper right-hand corner is excellent.
This horse at the bottom doesn't look anything like My Little Pony.
The writing, not the That's a dog.
I draw when I get anxious.
I think you made a wise decision not going into animation, Juliet.
Mmm.
Okay, fine.
Something about a missing kid.
He's not a kid.
He's 18.
And he's only been gone for 24 hours, so technically he's not missing.
You want my help.
I'm not sure yet.
His name is Malone Breyfogle.
Malone Breyfogle?
Mmm-hmm.
I'll tell you this much, kid's been lifted up by his underwear more than once.
He seems like a good kid.
Honor roll, never been in trouble.
His mother's worried sick.
You can't do anything until he's been missing for 48 hours?
That's so stupid.
Exactly.
I know the rules and regulations.
They made sense when I memorized them, but When you have to look into some poor mother's eyes and tell her she can't worry about her son until he's two days missing That is really depressing.
Consider me hired.
You're not hired.
I can't pay you.
If it turns out there's something to it, I'll make sure you get put on the case.
That's all I can do.
Juliet, I'm quite sure we can work out some kind of services exchange.
You see, I like to do a little sketching myself, and sometimes I need a model.
Huh.
Was that inappropriate?
Felt okay.
Let me get this straight.
I left in the middle of work to come check out a case, which is not a case, in which we likely won't get paid.
Who are you kidding right now?
I pulled you out of a Starbucks.
Where you were pretending to finish your route that you actually finished yesterday so we could do a tiny favor for Juliet that will grant us much larger favors in the future.
Preferably ones that I can't mention in the presence of nuns or men of the cloth.
Oh, hello.
Thank you so much for coming.
Come in.
Can I get you boys anything?
They'll be ready in a minute.
I can't believe you're letting that woman make us pancakes.
She offered, Gus.
Tell me you're not excited about pancakes.
She's worried sick.
Cooking helps her cope.
How do you know that?
How do you know it doesn't?
Do you boys want your syrup warmed up?
I don't need it, Mrs. Breyfogle, but Gus does, so, I guess, yes.
You're the one who won't eat cold syrup.
Yeah, but I'm working you into the conversation.
Now she knows your name.
I'm just afraid something terrible has happened.
Here you go.
Mmm-hmm.
My son, Malone, has been acting so strange lately.
Strange how?
Well, he worked so hard to get a paid summer internship with a big computer company, then turned it down at the last second, wouldn't tell me why.
Rarely leaves his room.
Even his two oldest friends, Rob and Don, tell me they hardly get to see him.
Have you spoken with Rob and Don since Malone disappeared?
No.
I spoke to their parents.
Both boys are at computer camp.
All right.
These are delicious.
Yes.
But I need to see his room.
Are you all right?
I feel the answer is in the light.
The light?
Shawn?
Will you tell the spirit to hurry the hell up?
Oh, yes.
Yes, I'm definitely feeling something here.
It's good.
It's nice.
What?
What is it?
This mattress.
It feels like one of those mattresses where you can bounce a bowling ball, but the glass of wine doesn't spill.
Gus, go find a glass of wine and a bowling ball.
Mrs. Breyfogle, I feel we'll find a clue in here.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end How does some 18-year-old kid still living at home make that kind of money?
Lemonade stand?
That is, if instead of lemons, he's using heroin.
Whatever it is, anything that pays in stacks of cash like that can't be legal.
Or healthful.
It's obvious what happened.
Malone was involved in some shady dealings.
He's either off on a spending spree or things got a little too shady for him.
So, what now?
Find his friends.
Computer camp, please.
Malone's rolling in dough.
Whatever he's doing, they're with him.
We find them, we find him.
The question is where.
Wait a second.
You don't already know where he is?
Gus, I'm a professional gathering information, okay?
I'm getting there.
You know, Shawn, I I just thought you were a little better than this.
Just a little.
All right, what is this?
You know where he is?
Of course I do.
While you're playing with light switches and ordering breakfast, I was investigating a case.
I see.
Okay.
Okay, I'll bite.
Where is he, Chocolate Columbo?
Tri-Con.
Do what?
Tri-Con.
The Tri-Annual Comic Book and Science Fiction Convention is in Santa Barbara this weekend.
You saw all those comic books in Malone's room.
You're 18 years old.
You have a ton of cash burning a hole in your pocket and you love comics.
Where else would you go to spend your disposable income?
Think, Shawn.
Gus, I apologize.
That's brilliant.
Thank you.
Let's verify it so we can go check it out.
Shawn, I'm sure he's there.
There's no doubt.
You're sure?
Yep.
How's that?
Are those directions to the convention center?
I found it in his wastebasket.
You know, in case I never said it, I was really pleased when you were named as chief.
Interim chief.
I'm sure that's only temporary.
Mmm-hmm.
It's true that the outgoing chief was important to me.
He was my mentor.
Made me the cop I am today.
Mmm-hmm.
I know the outside perception is that the force was a real boys' club under him, so I thought it was really smart when they named a, you know, woman.
All right, honey.
Excuse me, what?
I love you.
Huh?
Okay.
Yeah, I'll just see you when we get back.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Detective, were you saying something?
No, I wasn't.
We can't just walk into the con.
I'm sorry, "the con"?
Yeah.
You're calling a place filled with overweight teenagers battling mild cases of scoliosis and advanced bed-wetting "the con"?
We can't get in there.
The tickets were sold out a month ago.
Did you already try to get tickets?
Focus, Shawn.
How much were they?
Will you focus?
No, no, no, leave this out of sight until we get the issues resolved with the food in his room, all right?
I don't know if he's going to walk over the blueberry issue, but we cannot have people lining up until we're sure he's participating.
I gotta call his agent.
Get me a list of all the produce vendors in the area.
We can't risk alienating the Star Trek fans.
You can't come in without tickets.
They didn't tell you we were coming?
Who?
We work for George.
Takai?
You mean Takei?
Yeah.
Those closest to him know exactly how he likes it pronounced, okay?
You think you can have a convention without Commander Chekov?
Sulu, jackass.
Have his fresh blueberries arrived yet?
I don't have record of receiving them yet.
You don't have record of having received them yet.
Give me that.
They don't have the fresh blueberries.
What's the big deal?
What's the big deal?
What is the big deal?
Do you have any idea what happened when they forgot his blueberries at the con in San Antonio?
That comb-over will be the least of your You know what, it's better.
It's better if you don't know.
It's how I ended up with a stutter and a wooden pinky toe.
Now for the love of Scotty Still Sulu.
Would you Please, let me get in there and save all of our asses?
Dude, some guy in a wolf costume with a light saber just said hi to you.
I don't know that guy.
He looked right at you.
He was mistaken.
He said, "Hi, Gus.
" And then another dude with a cape and a codpiece gave you a half-nod.
I don't know any of these people, Shawn, okay?
Uh-huh.
Hey, guys.
I'm Talia.
This is Dent.
We're from Parastone Pictures and just wanted to remind you to go see the world premiere of the Red Phantom trailer tomorrow night.
It'll be the biggest movie of the summer.
Do not miss out.
No way, I love the dead phantom.
Red Phantom.
What, he didn't die at the end?
Bye.
Bye.
I hear this movie's going to bomb.
Check one.
Check two.
Too bad.
I kind of dug the Red Phantom.
You haven't even seen the trailer, you already hate it, how's that possible?
Fortress of Attitude.
What did you just say to me?
Fortress of Attitude.
It's this site that reviews movies based on comic books.
The Malcontent, the guy who runs it, says he already saw a 30-minute presentation here at the convention.
He blazed it online.
Can't you just look at porn on the net like every other guy and his brother?
Everybody reads this blog.
No.
Not everybody.
Everybody here does, Shawn.
And you know what?
I don't care what you think.
So why don't you let me do the talking here at the convention, and try not to embarrass me.
This is my turf.
And yes, I know the guy in the codpiece.
His name is Dave.
And he's a very nice guy.
Snap.
Two for 50 cents.
What?
That's Hiltz Kooler.
Excuse me, Mr. Kooler?
I'm a huge Green Spirit fan.
He's my favorite, actually.
I was wondering, would you mind signing my original copy of The Green Spirit Strikes Again?
Whoa.
Haven't seen one of these in a while.
I couldn't believe I found a guy selling one.
I love how this story reinvented the character for today.
Well, there you go.
Enjoy.
It's one of my favorites.
You know, I wish they'd based the movie on this story arc.
What am I gonna do?
I told them about a million times.
They don't listen to me.
Still a huge fan.
Well, I'm glad someone is after that Green Spirit movie.
Wait, wait, wait.
Is this the movie you dragged me to where the hero had big nipples on the outside of his costume?
Damn those nipples.
They were like big angry marshmallows.
Be nice to him, Shawn.
The Green Spirit movie nearly killed the character.
Gus, all I care about is finding our guys.
I can't take much more of this.
There's too much real estate.
We can't cover it all at once.
Maybe we should split up.
I can help our situation.
So, next on our list Sir, can I help you?
Yeah, I'm Shawn Spencer, psychic, SBPD.
I just need a moment.
Psychic?
Mmm-hmm.
Welcome.
Ladies and gentlemen, science fiction fans, we've got a special treat for you today, we have a psychic, a real live professional psychic.
Shawn, no.
Who's this?
This is my sidekick, Magic Head.
You're a psychic?
Like Professor X?
Professor X is a telepath, not a psychic.
But I do have telepathic tendencies.
No, you don't.
You have psychic visions.
They're different.
No, really, I can do both.
No, you can't.
Can you read me?
Sure.
I'm getting a reading.
I'm getting a reading right now, yes.
You spend a great deal of time in front of your computer.
And, I see a girl.
Yes.
You like her from afar.
She doesn't really know you exist.
Yes.
Yes.
Her name's Megan.
Do I have a chance?
Don't put too much work into it.
I think she might want to be "just friends.
" Shawn, we're supposed to be looking for Malone.
Obviously Malone is keeping a low profile.
Whoa!
Boy, I'm getting Whoa!
I'm getting an "R".
I am getting an "R".
Does anyone here have a name that begins with "R"?
Oh, wait a second Hold, nobody and a "D".
Yes a "D".
An "R" and a "D".
An "R" name Rim Rolph Robert No "bert," just Rob.
Rob.
And a "D" name, yes.
Uh, Dan.
Uh, Doodle.
Dook Dook Dookie Duder Dumb Don!
Yes!
Rob and a Don.
That's us!
An actual Rob and Don together.
Sometimes I scare myself.
Hey, fellas, first I need you both to empty your pockets.
Mmm Oh!
A room key.
Even though you both reside locally.
Oh, our friend sprang for a hotel suite for us.
Ah, room 129.
Yes, of course.
I'm getting something.
This friend you speak of, I sense you haven't seen him for a while, but you didn't tell anyone, no.
You're not supposed to be here.
You told your parents you were going to computer camp.
Computer camp, guys?
Really?
I know what you're hiding.
We're not going after them?
What for?
Malone's not with them.
But I think I know where he might be.
Ladies and gentlemen, Shawn Spencer and Magic Head.
Let's check out room 428.
Well, they seemed pretty convincing.
That's them there!
Why are you telling people you're my assistants?
Because we are your assistants.
Excuse me?
Are you serious, George?
I know we said we'd work outside the loop, but this is a little ridiculous.
I don't recognize you.
You hired us personally.
We met you in Chicago at a screening of that movie with the whales.
Star Trek  The Voyage Home.
The last time I was in Chicago, I was doing a reading from my autobiography.
Right.
We booked that.
Remember Robin told us he'd never be able to fill a room that size?
Yeah.
I don't know any Robin.
That's because I fired her.
Look, George, you don't need that kind of negativity, okay?
It's her fault what happened in San Antonio.
Though you didn't hear that from me.
I'm very confused.
Look, George, we can stand around and talk all day Like Robin used to.
Or I can try to do something about solving your blueberry crisis.
The choice is yours.
Well, all right, then.
Get to it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ew!
Gosh.
I see why Rob and Don were freaked.
They didn't want to be held responsible for this mess.
This place is trashed.
Maybe Johnny Depp stopped by.
I'm sorry, did that joke just arrive in a time machine from 1992?
He used to trash hotel rooms.
Used to.
The man has kids now.
He lives in France.
You got a better version?
Of course I do.
How about that lame-o who's dating Kate Moss?
He's British and nobody knows who he is.
Okay, fine.
Too inside.
Stephen Dorff.
Always solid.
Dude, come here.
Why would this kid have these mock-ups?
Because I think our missing person has a secret identity.
By day, he's a laptop-toting, comic-loving virgin.
At night, he's your favorite blogger.
You think The Malcontent is a kid?
He must have pissed off the wrong people with his blog.
Shawn, look.
"One down, two to go.
" Hmm.
There goes the kid-on-a-spending-spree theory.
Keith Moon.
I just went over the posts on Malone's blog.
Did he bash anything in particular?
The Red Phantom movie.
He's relentless.
It's weird, because if you go back a little, he was originally saying great things about it.
So Parastone Pictures paid him to praise the Red Phantom flick.
That must be where all the money from his room came from.
Makes sense.
Malone's blog started the bad buzz which sunk Parastone's last comic book movie.
I don't think the nipples helped either, Gus.
Well, yeah.
So the studio had everything riding on this new film.
They would have done anything to prevent history from repeating itself.
But Malone blazed The Red Phantom anyway.
He reneged, which might be why he's missing.
We need to find those execs.
Hey.
Any progress?
I picked up Malone's astral trail.
That's what it's called.
It leads to a hotel across from the convention center.
Room 428.
Oak door, can't miss it.
That's more specific than usual.
Sometimes the spirits are in a giving mood.
You won't find Malone, but I sense some seriously dark juju magumbo went down in there.
Yeah, send some uniforms to the hotel across from the convention center and tell them to cordon off room 428.
Good.
This had better be for real.
So, how's the convention?
A lot of cool stuff going on, I bet.
Oh, come on.
Not you, too.
You're a collector, too?
Since middle school.
I just got Hiltz Kooler's autograph.
Shut up, you did not?
Yes, I did.
Hi.
Missing kid, worried mom.
Can we focus here?
Since when did you get so structured?
Since you turned into Urkel and you just became Jan Brady Wow.
Tina Yothers There's There's not an exact match for that.
You didn't want to tell her about our suspicions with the Parastone executives?
Please, Gus, we have to leave something to divine later.
Yeah.
This is nice.
It's good one-on-one time.
Let the guard down.
You know, I had an idea not too long ago, and it's funny I should think of it now, but it really doesn't make any sense to have so many officers working the daytime shift at Grab.
Detective.
Since most car thefts occur at night.
Now, if you were to split the shift, go with me on this Carlton!
What?
My water just broke.
Are you sure?
No, Carlton, there's water spilling out of me for some other reason.
Oh, no.
Oh, can you move my briefcase?
Your briefcase?
It might be in the line of the Do you understand how uncomfortable this is?
It's leather.
I didn't Scotchguard it!
You know what, never mind.
Just has tremendous sentimental value.
Just take me to the nearest hospital.
All right?
Oh, I don't think we need that.
Oh, I think we do.
Do you know what?
We'll use the siren, too.
For you.
Just in case.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Can't stop to talk.
Got to sign autographs.
Look, dude, I got a date with that Talia girl from the studio in, like, an hour.
A nice romantic walk on the beach to Jim's.
Best scungilli in Santa Barbara.
Why couldn't you just talk to her now?
Because, Gus, happy hour doesn't start until 5:00.
You're supposed to be figuring out if she's innocent.
That's exactly what I plan to do.
Shawn.
GT.
The blueberries are still wrong.
I requested North Carolina blueberries, but they sent me Michigan blueberries.
People say I'm crazy, but I can taste the difference.
I don't think that's crazy at all.
And I requested that my green room not be at the end of the hall.
I have to be in the middle.
It's affecting my chi.
Gus.
What?
Did you skimp out and get the Michigan blueberries?
What?
And screw up the room location?
And what are you doing to George's chi?
Are you touching it and whatnot?
Stop it.
This is my fault, Mr. Takei.
My fault for farming out responsibilities that I should have seen to personally.
My humblest apologies.
We'll get you the right blueberries as soon as possible and a better room assignment.
You have my word.
Well, all right, then.
Good help is hard to find, I suppose.
Why did you blame that on me?
Dude, we needed a fall guy.
I can't be the fall guy in front of one of my heroes, Shawn.
Okay, then you and I need to create a third imaginary assistant that's completely incompetent.
I think her name should be Beatrice.
What say you?
All right, yeah, just send it to my assistant.
It's tremendous.
You don't mind it, though.
You don't mind all the comic book stuff?
It's fun, harmless, a little wish fulfillment.
Oh, come on, you didn't pretend to fly around like Superman when you were a kid?
So, uh, pretty high stakes on the Red Phantom movie, huh?
We, uh, took a bath a couple of years ago on this other comic book movie, The Adventures of the Green Spirit.
Yeah, the nipple flick.
God, is that all anyone remembers about that movie?
Yes.
Ugh, we had to build a landfill for the unsold action figures.
So, we're pulling out all the stops to launch the trailer for the Red Phantom movie.
You know, lasers, music.
Dent even organized this whole pyrotechnics display.
Word of mouth is the first and most vital step in this world.
Vital enough to pay somebody off?
What?
Hmm?
Let's say there's a blogger, right?
And he's wielding way more power than he should.
And he can be had for a price.
You guys would be fools not to take a shot, right?
Who are you, Shawn?
I'm a psychic.
I work with the police.
I'm investigating a disappearance.
Malone Breyfogle.
The Malcontent.
I'm sensing you probably know a lot about him.
Okay, this conversation is over.
No.
It's just starting to get good.
See, he reneged on a promise and now he's missing.
Missing?
Look, whether or not this guy had a consultation fee is besides the point.
We don't harm people.
It's just a movie.
Just a movie?
You think your boss will tell me the same thing?
I don't know.
Why don't we go ask him together?
Dent is back at our convention headquarters.
Fine.
So, no scungilli, then?
I didn't expect you to be so cooperative, so if I seemed a little pushy Accusing me of kidnapping?
I accused you of bribery.
I implied you may have had something to do with the kidnapping.
There's a difference.
You know, a lot of couples start off on the wrong foot.
It just means we have nowhere to go but up.
Well, when you're done here with Dent, we're done.
What the Oh, my God.
What happened here?
Where is he?
Some seriously dark juju magumbo went down in here.
"Two down, one to go.
" Okay, good news, your boss is innocent.
Bad news, he just became a face on a milk carton.
I checked Malone's blog again today.
There are more entries blazing the Red Phantom movie.
I think Malone was kidnapped before the blogs showed up.
He was probably going to honor his deal with Parastone.
So, the kidnapper is the one roasting this new movie online?
He also wrote, "The guilty will pay.
" The guilty will pay?
Yep.
Wow.
One of these comic book freaks has clearly blurred the line between reality and comic book.
The kidnapper still has one more person to snatch.
And it appears he's targeting anyone involved in this bribery scam.
Talia.
Talia has to be the next victim.
We need to get the real police in here.
Hello?
Uh, hello, Mr. Takei, what can I do for you?
Just name it.
Hold on.
It's for you.
G- Dog.
What's up, handsome?
Beatrice?
I canned her.
Yeah, she's out of here.
Tonight?
Absolutely, sir.
I'll meet you there.
Huh.
What?
What's happening?
Karaoke with George later.
Get out of here.
This is a Trek fan's dream come true.
Hmm.
Awkward.
What?
He sort of just invited me.
You know what?
Call him back, tell him I said we need you for all the high harmonies.
This is messed up, Shawn.
No, this is messed up.
This isn't a churro.
This is I don't know what this is.
Okay, finally got a hold ofyour husband.
He's on his way, but apparently traffic is a nightmare.
Thank you, Carlton.
Everything's looking really good.
You just relax.
I'm going to go now and let you No, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't Don't go.
You want me to stay?
Yeah.
In class, I always had a coach.
So, just stand here and keep your eyes north of the equator.
Yeah, that won't be a problem.
You ready for your epidural?
No, thank you.
I'm going to do this naturally.
Okay.
We'll hold off, then.
Mmm-hmm.
Are you insane?
I don't need it.
Listen, I would put myself on a morphine pump if I were going to push eleven pounds of limbs and elbows out of I've made my decision.
And I admire you for it.
Have you considered this?
Maybe the whole thing is a stunt.
What do you mean?
You know, to promote the movie.
The whole scenario is just so fantastical.
It's like a plot to a comic book.
Dent could have arranged it, maybe Talia.
It could have been all three of them.
It's just so theatrical with the cryptic notes.
Shawn?
Hi.
Hi.
Gus said you've seen the kidnapper.
You told her that?
We needed her.
Can you give me a description?
You can't tell her I've seen the kidnapper when I didn't see the kidnapper.
I didn't see the kidnapper.
You didn't?
I saw through the kidnapper's eyes.
He was stalking his next victim.
It was a woman.
Shawn.
Talia.
It's Talia.
Wait.
The woman you discovered the second note with is the third victim?
Quite possibly.
Or she could be the kidnapper.
So, what, she's kidnapping herself?
Or the second victim is the kidnapper and he was just pretending to get kidnapped.
Guys, I just saw her.
She's outside on the phone.
Man.
Where did you see her last?
Over there.
Oh, man.
"9-1 " Uh-oh.
What?
No note?
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
"Judgment day.
" Looks like Talia's joined Malone and Dent in missing-persons land.
Judgment day?
It sounds bad.
That's, like, the day that you're judged.
In T2 it was the end of mankind.
Though I doubt our kidnapper has first-strike nuclear capabilities.
Ooh!
What the hell are you doing?
Running makes me hungry.
You know that.
You don't know where those have been.
They could have bird flu on them or something.
Bird flu.
Wow.
Look at you.
How can you read a comic book at a time like this?
First of all, I can read a comic anytime.
And secondly, Juliet has almost the entire police force inside there.
They'll find Talia and the others.
Dude, whatever this crazy person has planned for these people, he's going to do it soon.
He has all his victims.
We need to figure out who stands to gain from the disappearance of those three and who would want the Red Phantom movie to tank this badly.
Why don't you ask your friend, George Takei?
I would.
But once he starts singing Afternoon Delight, he just goes to another place.
Shawn?
Juliet didn't find anything at the latest crime scene to help?
Shawn?
No forensics on the note?
Shawn?
What?
Look.
It's the same as the note in Malone's room.
Somebody's recreating the crime from this comic book.
What happens in this thing?
A supervillain named Fear Career, he kidnaps the judge, prosecutor and defense attorney he felt locked him up years ago.
Fear Career.
Awesome.
Then what?
He sets them on fire.
He sets them on fire?
Yeah.
Give me that.
What the hell are you doing?
Looking for clues.
You're ruining a first printing near-mint work of art.
I've been looking for that comic for five years now.
Gus, lives are at stake.
The kidnapper must be some kind of deranged fan.
Deranged?
Yes.
Fan?
I'm not so sure.
Wait, what?
What the You're buying me another one.
First printing!
She's not focusing.
Can you help motivate her a little bit?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Motivation was my thing at the academy.
All right, now you listen to me, it's time to squeeze this puppy out.
So, when I say push, I want you to push, you understand me?
Push!
Push!
Push!
Yeah, that's not really working for me right now!
Fine, I was just giving it a shot!
Um, okay, okay.
Just, just remain calm.
Everything's going to be fine.
Uh, yeah.
I don't need that either.
I don't know what you want then.
I don't know what any woman wants.
Just give me your hand and shut the hell up.
It's crowning.
Here we go.
Here we go.
It's a girl.
We did it.
Want to cut the cord, Dad?
No, I'm not the Yeah, okay.
Oh, oh, you're going to Oh!
Hi, there.
Nice to meet you.
Children are one of the reasons my wife and I split up.
She didn't think I wanted any.
She was wrong.
Yeah, that's great, Carlton.
You think I might hold my baby now?
Of course.
We need to find Juliet fast.
She's in plain clothes.
She could be anywhere in this place.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I know how I can get her attention.
Shawn!
Will you stop going up there?
Sorry.
Judgment day.
Got to do it.
Ladies and gentlemen, George Uh, okay, okay.
Please welcome back to the stage psychic Shawn Spencer!
I'm sensing something.
Something strong.
A spirit.
A disturbed spirit.
Why is my assistant up there?
Maybe he's setting up a karaoke machine for your duet, Chekov.
Sulu, damn it!
It's getting clear now.
It's a kidnapping spirit responsible for crimes committed right here at the con!
I need help.
I must call upon the powers of Magic Head!
Magic Head!
Magic Head!
Magic Head!
Magic Head!
Magic Head!
Who's Magic Head?
Where are you going?
I can see it now.
It is a vengeful spirit and there is a color.
The color is green.
It is the Green Spirit.
The kidnapper is the creator ofThe Green Spirit, Hiltz Kooler.
Ah, yes, you had motive, didn't you?
The studio execs bastardized your beloved Green Spirit and turned him into a pop culture punch line.
You hated Malone, The Malcontent, because it was his tidal wave of bad buzz that sunk your flick.
You were on the brink of becoming a mogul.
But then it all slipped away.
Now you're reduced to cursing nipples and signing autographs at conventions.
Like a classic supervillain, you were driven mad by revenge.
You read Malone's blogs, looking for clues to his true identity.
Then, one day, like manna from heaven, The Malcontent blogged he was coming here.
You also read the execs who had screwed your character would be here, too.
All the people that wronged you in the same place at the same time.
The opportunity was too good to pass up.
And you could hide your identity by wearing a costume.
And every time you snatched one of your victims, you left a note just like Fear Career in your comic.
Yes, people!
This was written by a criminal.
There is malice in the ink.
I can see it now.
Hiltz always had a very distinctive way of writing the letter "O.
" It has the swirl.
I'm sure if the police analyzed this autograph, they'll see the handwriting is an exact match for the kidnapper's threatening notes.
It's the same thing that happened in San Antonio.
Where are your victims?
My plan is already in motion and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
Somebody's re-creating the crime from this comic book.
What happens in this thing?
He sets them on fire.
They're near fire.
Dent even organized this whole pyrotechnics display.
Under the stage.
Oh, down here.
They're here.
All of them.
Look, don't worry, everything's going to be just fine, okay?
We're going to get you out of here.
Guys.
Hi.
Hi.
So, after I collared the villain and saved the girl, Jules grabbed the others and everyone hoisted me on their shoulders, carried me to the car chanting my name.
It was awesome.
Oh, but your story about cutting the cord was good, too.
Lot of drama, suspense, twist ending that I don't think any of us saw coming.
At which point did you faint?
I did not faint.
I was merely resting my eyes momentarily and fell slightly backwards.
Hey, I don't know if it makes a difference.
I think you're a hero.
Which one is hers?
I don't know.
Lassiter, you cut the cord.
Well, they all look alike.
Is there one that poops a lot?
I know.
Let's ask our psychic.
You know what, guys, this is weird, I'm not getting anything.
I think one of these babies might be evil, blocking my abilities to communicate.
Damien?
Come on.
Isn't it obvious?
She looks exactly like me.
Hi.
Chief, should you be up and walking?
Walking?
I'm coming into work tomorrow.
No, don't be ridiculous.
You need to go home with your child.
Relax.
Take a load off.
Refresh yourself.
January, I think January.
Come back in January.
So glad you both could make it.
Make it?
I live here.
What's that behind your back, Shawn?
I dropped back by the con.
You went back without me?
Those people, good people, good hearts.
You were right from the beginning, Gus.
And I didn't want to ruin the surprise.
Introducing, Tranya Independent Comics' latest limited-edition one-shot Surprise.
"Follow the adventures of Psych-Man "as he uses his bizarre mental powers to foil criminal plots "with his sidekick Magic Head.
" And bam!
What's that supposed to be?
Dude, it's Magic Head!
It's like looking in a mirror.
Why would I need a wand when I have a magic head?
It's a ceremonial thing.
It's, it's just It's representative.
You don't actually use the wand.
Stupid.
I think it's dope.
Now, who wants an autograph?
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Everyone stay together, please.
Our next stop is the primate habitat.
You hear that, Trish?
Monkeys.
We're going to visit your family.
Knock it off, Shawn.
Now, some people believe that the next animal we're going to see is the ugliest creature in the whole animal kingdom.
Does anybody want to guess which animal that is?
It's definitely got to be Trish!
I hate you, Shawn Spencer!
Shawn!
I wonder what it is!
Whoa.
Miss Bodansky, I think the ostrich might be choking.
Oh, I wouldn't worry.
I'm sure it's just eating.
Yeah, that's That's how they swallow their food.
I'm pretty sure that's not food.
A tennis ball, Shawn?
What are you thinking?
What are you doing throwing a tennis ball at an ostrich?
The thing could have died, and the zoo would have made me pay for it.
I don't even know what an ostrich costs.
I didn't do it.
I didn't throw the ball!
Stop lying, Shawn.
You're only making things worse!
Maybe he's telling the truth.
Are you, Shawn?
Are you telling the truth?
Yes, sir.
Did you see who did throw it?
No, sir.
But I think it might have been an accident.
I think they meant to hit me.
I believe him.
He's telling the truth.
With all due respect, Captain, you call the shots at work, not here.
You deal with your kid.
I'll deal with mine.
You, scoot over.
I believe you, Shawn.
Gus!
What?
Gus, Gus, Gus, Gus, Gus!
Come here!
What?
Look at this.
Isn't that Trish Connors?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and her dad.
Whoa!
Wow, she looks Hot!
I was going to say vulnerable, maybe a little upset, but I mean, she was cute in high school, but she sure has grown.
I wonder what Trish and Captain Connors are talking about?
Why don't I just read her lips?
'Cause you can't.
Sure, I can.
Shh!
"I'm sorry, father.
"I can't fight it any longer.
"I love Shawn.
"I'm in love with Shawn.
" "Stop pretending to be insane, daughter.
" Daughter?
He calls her, "daughter"?
"You know you belong with Gus!
"He's smarter and funnier, plus he has abs like Bruce Lee.
" Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay, okay.
If we're gonna do the lip-reading game, we have to say things that are at least remotely believable.
I am.
"Abs like Bruce Lee"?
Dude, they're coming in!
Act natural.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Oh, hey!
Shawn?
You probably don't remember me Don't speak!
Oh!
I'm seeing a face A face from the past.
We know each other.
Yes, we do.
I said no speaking.
Oh, sorry.
We were classmates.
Yes!
Sorry.
Did we ever kiss?
No.
I'm sorry.
That image may very well be coming from the not-too-distant future.
I'm getting a name.
Connor!
Trish?
Trish Connors?
Wow!
Look at you!
Oh, my God!
You look amazing!
What are you doing down here?
Wait.
Why am I sensing your father?
Dad!
Yes.
Captain Connors, it is so good to see you again, sir.
Please, come in, guys!
Sit down in our cushy chair!
Dad, you remember Shawn and Gus, we went to high school together.
I know who they are.
That's Henry's boy.
You don't have to speak to me as though I'm a child.
Now, the reason that we came to see you is that there is a Um Dad, do you want me to hold something or No, no, not now, please.
I have to just Oh, damn it!
Nobody breathe.
I'm seeing something.
Gus.
There was violence.
Murder.
Yes.
There was a murder.
Yes, exactly!
A murder, a 187, and I solved it.
You bet your ass!
So, what do you need us for?
Because, damn it, I can't remember who's been killed!
Or who the killer was.
Did you go to the police?
Oh, they're useless, all of them.
Without evidence, they won't even speak to you.
Thirty years I spent on that force.
But they still refuse to believe me when I tell them that there was a murder, and that I solved it!
But I'm having trouble remembering Actually, remembering anything.
That's why I'm here.
To see if you could Maybe you could look into my head.
See what I can't find there.
But you believe me, don't you?
Yes, sir.
I believe you.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end So, your Trish says that this is where her father comes every morning for his coffee.
He was here when he thought he saw the murder.
So?
So, maybe we'll see something that led an ex-cop to believe a murder had been committed.
Plus, double-chocolate mango-pineapple scones.
Apparently made fresh daily.
What I'm saying, Gus, the morning is essentially a win-win.
Oh, no!
What?
Little "i"s.
Gus, little "i"s, little "i"s.
We gotta go!
What?
Little "i"s!
What about Connors?
What about the double- chocolate mango-pineapple?
Forget the scones.
There's only one person I know who makes the Don't rush off on my account!
Dad!
Shawn, you remember my old captain, Brett Connors.
Of course.
Captain Connors, how are you, sir?
Look at you fellas, all grown up!
How long's it been, huh?
About a day.
Less, actually.
Excuse me?
Yes, can I help you?
I don't know.
My name is Sabrina.
Vito.
Sabrina Vito.
And I think that my boyfriend might be missing.
He hasn't called and he won't answer the phone and I'm a little afraid that something might have happened.
So, I've been putting these up all over town.
It's okay.
Why don't you come over here and sit down?
Okay.
Oh, that's right, that's right.
That's right, this chick was sunbathing naked in the plaza.
No!
You should have seen your old man chasing her with the cuffs.
This gal was so covered with suntan oil, every time he grabbed her she squirted right out of his hands.
And that reminds me of that 502 that we picked up that New Year's Eve, over on Olive Avenue.
How do you remember all this stuff?
Ah, it's easy.
Like it was yesterday.
Speaking of yesterday, Captain, is this the table that you always sit at?
Because I'm getting something here.
The murder?
The murder?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were sitting here when you saw the victim.
Shawn, what are you talking about?
Shut up, Henry.
I solved a new murder.
And your boy here's the only one who believes me.
Now, let the kid work!
I'm seeing a man Shaved head.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes, yes His name Mif Mif-you No.
May?
Mick?
Mike!
His name is Mike!
He was arguing over in the park with that bastard Mort Crocker.
A mountain lion He pinned it on a mountain lion!
Now, if I can just prove it All right, look, why don't I play psychic here for a moment?
It wasn't a young man.
It was a young woman.
She's pretty.
Brunette hair, nice figure, she liked to play Scrabble with her friends.
Her name was Zoe.
Yeah, you're right.
That's who was murdered.
They said it was a mountain lion, but they were wrong!
Dad, you're amazing!
Maybe my psychic gift is hereditary.
Shawn, Zoe Sharp is a young woman who was found dead 20 years ago, mauled by a mountain lion.
Connors and I worked the case.
So, she was murdered?
She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
A tragedy, yes.
A murder?
No.
Not then, and not now.
Okay, okay, let's forget Zoe Sharp, may she rest in peace.
But Connors still saw the guy on the "Missing" poster arguing with Mort Crocker in the park.
What?
Shawn, we have no idea what Connors saw or what he didn't see.
The man is ill.
Early-onset Alzheimer's.
His mind, the past, the present, it's all screwy.
It's all the same to him.
So, he sees Crocker standing there in the park.
It triggers an old memory of Zoe.
Next thing you know, he's living in the past.
Dad, this guy's your friend.
He came to me for help.
Shawn, leave him be.
He doesn't need your help to make him look like an old fool.
He deserves better than that.
Shawn!
Run, little alien!
Run!
Shawn!
What?
You're gonna want to see this.
See what?
Look!
Uh Coincidence?
I don't think so.
So, when my dad said he solved a murder, you think this is the guy that was killed?
Well It seems like a simple question, doesn't it, Trish?
I'm afraid the answer is a bit more complicated.
You see, as a psychic, it is important that I elicit the proper I'm sorry.
Raise your hand if you want to know how my amazing gift works!
Gus, you're so much better at this.
Why don't you tell Trish how it works.
I've got some stuff I need to do.
Sure.
The answer to your question is yes, we do believe that is the victim.
Please.
So, what's the next step?
Well, being that the authorities believe he was killed by a mountain lion, Shawn is going to attempt to elicit a psychic link with this suspect, in order to establish his guilt or innocence.
And by suspect, you mean The mountain lion, yes.
Amazing.
Not really, it's it's It's fairly common for a psychic to be able to read different species of the animal kingdom.
No, not that.
What?
The way that he's sitting there so quiet.
I mean, in high school he was always so loud, and needed attention constantly and needed to be noticed.
And he just would not shut up!
He was so annoying.
He drove me nuts!
But now I mean, look at him, he's so Calm, so unobtrusive.
And the way he let you just step in and take over like that.
I think he's really matured.
Yeah, yeah, he has.
Dad!
No!
No!
He was mauled by a mountain lion.
You don't find that the least bit coincidental?
Of course it's coincidental, Shawn.
But it doesn't make it murder.
No, it makes it an episode of When Animals Attack: Santa Barbara.
Yes, well, mountain lions do attack in Santa Barbara.
In fact, you watch the news, right?
That's your source of psychic information?
It happens.
Connors came to me.
He says, "I solved a murder.
" Shawn, Connors was a good cop.
And the thing that made him a good cop is that he never accepted the easy answer.
But that doesn't mean that he was always right.
Obviously somewhere in his mind, he's confused something that happened 20 years ago with something that's happened today.
Okay, fine.
Talk to me more about 20 years ago.
How does Zoe Sharp connect to Mort Crocker?
Mort Crocker founded the Mort's family restaurant chain.
He was the CEO.
At the time, Zoe Sharp was his assistant, and there was a rumor A rumor!
That they were having an affair.
Nice, that's good stuff!
And Connors knew about it?
Of course he knew about it.
Every good cop makes it his job to know about things like that, but there was never any proof, Shawn.
No proof!
And even if there was, somewhere in some corner of his mind there is a memory, a lingering memory, searching for closure.
But then he sees Mike here arguing with Mort Crocker.
Connors is not the most reliable witness, Shawn.
Dad, he's onto something.
One mountain lion, two mountain lions!
Mountain lions!
You're right.
You should talk to a mountain lion.
Whoa!
Simba!
I am your father.
I don't think Mufasa said that.
Ah, Mufasa, Vader, I'm Not Rappaport, it's all James Earl Jones.
I'm Not Rappaport was Ossie Davis.
It still works.
We're not even supposed to be in here.
Relax.
I love cats, and it's been proven that cats love me.
Well, this cat likes to eat people.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
You're not going to eat anybody No!
What's going on here?
Who authorized you to be in here?
Uh Please, excuse us.
I am Dr. Hans Jorgenson, and this is my very distinguished colleague, Dr. Mc Tock.
I am so sorry.
I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow.
Yeah, we have arrived early.
Well, I'm happy you're here.
I'm Joan Walker, the zoo director.
Oh, let's see.
Oh, look!
Dr. Hans Jorgenson.
Look what they have done for us!
Dr. Mc Dr. Mc Tock.
Dr. Mc Tock.
Mmm.
Oh, what?
Oh, it is nothing.
You see, the Kosov language is very difficult to master, yes?
It seems you have, uh, inadvertently uttered a vile Kosov obscenity.
Oh, I am terribly sorry.
Don't worry.
My colleague only speaks the English at a very pre-school level, and he is very forgiving of others.
For instance, yesterday I poured a hot cocoa over his genitals, and I say, "I'm sorry," and it's fine.
Now, is that the man-eating lion that we have read so much about?
No, no.
He's not a man-eater.
No, no, if he attacked, it's only because he was malnourished.
So, tell us.
Why is the cat so malnourished?
I really don't know.
I mean, we had record rainfall this year.
There's an abundance of foliage for his prey to feed on.
He should be fat, but he's underweight.
Perhaps it is because everyone in California is on the diet?
Yeah?
All of the surfing boys and the model girls.
I mean, someone, anyone, please give them a sandwich, yeah?
Meatball, uh-huh?
What is that?
The cat doesn't look like it's eaten in weeks.
Doesn't make sense.
Yes, this is Joan.
Oh, well, where's Dr. Zamfir?
Actually, no, no, stay right there.
I might have someone who can help us.
Seems we have a bit of a situation.
One of our warthogs is ready to give birth, but our vet is away on an emergency.
Could you please ask Dr. Mc The doctor, if, as a distinguished veterinarian, he would please help us bring a new warthog into the world?
Please excuse while we confer.
Meercat He would be honored, yes.
So, just lead us the way.
Thank you, thank you.
What are you doing?
We don't know anything about delivering warthog babies!
Oh!
A baby is a baby, you just pull it out at the right time!
The real question is, are you allergic to placenta?
Oh, God!
My eyes!
My eyes!
Again, Mr. Crocker, thank you for coming in.
I know how hectic your schedule is.
Don't mention it, Detective Lassiter.
I'm never too busy to help Santa Barbara's finest.
Why don't you tell me what this is about?
Did you see this in the paper?
Yes, I did.
Sad.
We have information that you were seen with the victim the day before his body was found.
No, it wasn't me.
Why don't we just cut to the chase?
It was that detective, Connors, wasn't it?
can't let it go.
I really can't say.
Mike's body was found on this trail.
It's closed.
Now what?
Just hold on, let me think a minute.
Okay.
I have a plan.
It's a little crazy, but it might just work.
Okay.
What?
Dude, we totally made it.
We're in!
Shawn, in case you're confused, "closed" means, "go away.
" "Stay out.
" Yes, in the negative language dictionary, which is clearly the only edition you own.
But in the positive language edition, closed means, "Come in, step over the chain, "there's so many less people to trample all over what you're looking for.
" You really think you can track the animal?
Perhaps you've forgotten about my extensive experience with the Native Americans, a proud and solvent people.
Working at the Flaming Tomahawk?
So, you do remember.
Shawn, you were a greeter in the casino, for a week.
The only non-Native American to be awarded an eagle feather.
Always remember that, Gus.
Oh, please!
Black lab!
Akita!
Lizard.
Okay, now you're just making stuff up.
Flamingo.
What if we do find these mountain lion tracks?
What then?
Well, we clearly follow them to the kill zone and look for clues.
What kill zone?
What?
Felis concolor.
It's Latin for mountain lion.
Let's follow them, and see where they lead.
This is it!
What?
The kill zone.
The kill happened here.
Except Except what?
Except the drag marks are coming from that direction.
The lion tracks we followed are over there.
If this lion dragged and killed its prey, the tracks and the marks should match up.
They should come from the same direction.
Gus, you know what this means?
The murder didn't happen here!
Exactly.
This cat was framed.
I guess you guys can't read.
This area is closed.
What are we doing here?
I'm burning up in this thing.
No you're not.
Yes, I am.
You've been wandering lost in the woods for two nights and you're suffering from extreme hypothermia.
Now, shiver!
How are you feeling?
Better?
Oh, Ranger De Soto, this soup is amazing.
Gus called it a chowder, and I'm tempted to agree.
Do you think you might have any crackers to go with it?
Perhaps those little oyster kind?
I'll check.
You're too kind.
Crackers?
Really?
For someone who supposedly drinks his own urine, your palate is suddenly very sophisticated.
Let's get out of here!
We can't.
We've got work to do.
I think there's more to this gun-toting ranger than meets the eye.
Like what?
Well, for starters He just happens to know the infamous Mort Crocker and his wife, Edna.
Coincidence?
Shawn, it's a fundraiser.
The Crockers probably posed with everybody in there.
What about the giant cage outside?
What about it?
I suspect that at one point, our man-eating mountain lion was kept in that cage, and sustained a small cut.
Yeah, when they trapped him and took him to the zoo.
Sorry, all I have is saltines.
Is that okay?
Oh, believe me, when you're starving, you'll eat anything, including the poop of indigenous beasts.
Speaking of which, when we were lost out there, Gus here was little-girl-scared that we might be eaten by some kind of wild animal.
Does that sort of thing ever really happen?
Well, it's not unheard of.
Fact is, we had a guy killed by a mountain lion just a couple of days ago.
Does that kind of thing happen often?
Oh, a few times in the past 50 years.
I thought mountain lions were afraid of humans.
Generally, but if they get hungry enough We've had a really dry year, that means reduced vegetation, and reduced vegetation means fewer deer and the like for the lions to feed on.
You can't really blame the cat.
It gets hungry and it wants to eat.
You mind if I ask you a question that's completely unrelated?
Sure.
Is that real mahogany?
Now, what do we know?
We know there was plenty of rain this year, no reason for a mountain lion to be malnourished.
Why was Ranger De Soto lying?
Why do people usually lie?
He's hiding something.
Henry Spencer back from lunch yet?
Henry Spencer?
I'm sorry, who are you?
Never mind.
Just tell him to come and find me.
We need to go over that Zoe Sharp file again.
Whoa!
Excuse me, sir.
You can't go back there!
What the hell is all this?
Captain Connors?
Yeah.
May I help you?
This is my desk.
Look, son.
I don't know who the hell you are, but you're confused.
This is my desk.
It's been my desk for years.
Now, you can either help me find the Zoe Sharp file, or take a hike.
You know what?
Maybe there's someone we should call.
Hey, look, I don't have time for all this crap.
I've got work to do!
Sir, please.
Don't make this difficult.
Hey, you wanna dance, pal?
You just name that tune.
Come on!
I don't know, Shawn.
Accusing Crocker of murder's a pretty big deal.
It doesn't bother you that we're missing things like motive, where the murder took place, or any kind of evidence or proof?
News flash, Gus, the cops think I'm a psychic.
I just have to get a feeling at the right time.
Shawn!
Gus!
What are you doing here?
My father, he's disappeared.
Hey!
Come on.
Where?
All right, now you are starting to piss me off, old man.
Come here!
It's time for you to go.
Henry!
Henry!
Tell them who I am!
Um I think he's talking to you.
Oh, God, please tell me I don't look anything like my father.
You could be his twin.
Look at the back of my head.
Is my hair starting to thin at all?
Shawn!
Henry!
I think we all know who this is.
This is Captain Brett Connors, one of the finest cops in the SBPD, someone I'd be happy to share a squad car with.
What the hell is going on, Spencer?
This man happens to be my friend, now let him go.
He's your responsibility.
Get him out of here.
Let's go, Captain.
I should report them all to Internal Affairs.
They should be brought up on charges.
I couldn't agree more.
You head home, I'll draw up the paperwork.
That's the girlfriend.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Was his name Mike?
Yeah, it was.
How did you know?
Shawn Spencer, police psychic.
I know that this must be a very tough time for you.
Sabrina.
Sabrina I am so sorry for your loss.
You know, he'd come all this way.
Lived so much, and his whole life can be condensed into a few items in this box.
Mike wasn't from here, was he?
No, no, he was visiting.
Yeah, that's right.
We were both from Pennsylvania.
Mike came out here to search for his birth parents.
I am sensing a longing.
He was so sad the first time he called me.
He just found out that his birth mother had been dead for almost And that would explain the sadness that I'm feeling.
But then a few days later he called to say that he thought he had located his birth father.
I'd never heard him more excited.
Did Mike bring another pair of shoes with him on this trip?
No, no.
Just what he had on him.
It was pretty sudden, this trip out here.
I see.
Sabrina, I'm feeling that Mike does not want you to be sad.
Can you tell me, did Mike get to meet his birth father?
He said he was a really wealthy man and difficult to get to.
Yes.
Yes, he did.
A biotin deficiency can be hereditary.
It's not exactly a paternity test, but let's see if Crocker has the same prescription.
If so, we know Connors is right.
This is a fortress.
We need a plan.
I don't think we can exactly just ring the buzzer and ask to peek into Mr. Crocker's medicine cabinet.
Why not?
That sounds perfectly reasonable to me.
Why can't we be from the state board of medicine cabinet inspectors?
I don't know, Shawn.
I know I'm right on this one.
Let's think this through.
No, Gus.
Come on, let's go in without a plan, flying by the seat of our pants.
It'll be so much more fun, trust me.
See, look, man.
There's some kind of commotion happening here.
Planning a party.
It's a piece of cake.
They're never going to notice us.
Excuse me, where are your badges?
Oh, I don't need a badge, I'm the event planner.
The event planner's a woman.
Yeah, I'm her assistant.
Also a woman.
To the assistant.
I'm calling security.
No, no, no, no!
You don't need to do that.
Don't tell me what to do.
The rules are very strict here.
Really?
You're going to let your bosses run you around like that?
You're gonna let the man hold you down?
These freak bastards with their rules and regulations?
You're a human person!
You need to rise up and tell them all to go to hell.
We can all do it together!
Let us empower you.
I'm Edna Crocker, and you are one minute away from a squad car ride.
Probably ought to let this one go.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm here to pick up a prescription for a Mr. Crocker, Mort Crocker.
One moment, please.
Thank you.
See, you should listen to me every once in a while.
That's not fair.
I don't have access to medical files and doctor's names.
Shawn, I called two pharmacies, while you were being interrogated.
I don't have anything for Mr. Crocker.
Are you sure about that?
Yes.
Um Can I just get back there for a second?
I'm sorry, we don't have anything, and someone has already picked up all of his most recent prescriptions.
Is it that bastard, Jimmy Derukie?
Shawn, please.
I'll tell you what, before I go a little nuts, why don't you just give me the name of the prescriptions and we can get out of here.
Okay, okay, see, it's a long-standing prescription.
It needs to be renewed.
No one's gonna go nuts here.
Okay, no, I do have something, but they picked that up over two months ago.
Really?
What was that?
The penicillin?
No, it was his regular dosage of something called Biotin.
Yes, is that what you're looking for?
Yes.
Thank you.
All right, Spencer.
You said you found an eyewitness for Mike McMillan's murder.
Where is he?
Okay, Mike.
Go ahead.
Tell the detectives exactly what you told me.
You're kidding me, right?
And we're out of here.
Mike says he was in town searching for his natural birth parents.
If you don't believe him, you can ask his girlfriend.
That's true.
She told me.
Did she also tell you that he found his birth father?
Well, what about his birth mother?
Did Mike say if he found her?
No, no.
He didn't say anything.
See, he can't.
He's a picture on a piece of paper, and dead.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Mike said his mother was killed 20 years ago, right after he was born.
Her name was Zoe Sharp.
I knew it.
That son of a bitch.
He killed her and now he got rid of the baby!
He protects his business, his reputation, and he doesn't have to share his wealth.
Sounds like a motive for murder to me.
Really?
Yep.
Then how do you explain the mountain lions?
Huh?
You're so smart?
How do you explain that?
Lassi, why are you asking him?
He was just a baby when his mother was killed.
In fact, he wasn't even there.
Summer of '86 was hot and dry.
There were a lot of fires.
Lions were all going hungry.
I remember some of them came right into town looking for food.
Crocker killed Zoe and dumped her body in the hills.
He didn't know about the lions, that just happened!
They ate the evidence and covered his tracks!
He just got lucky!
What about this time?
With Michael, he just got lucky again?
No, not this time.
This time he had help.
Ranger De Soup De Soto!
De Soto provided the lion.
De Soto?
I know that name.
I just can't remember why.
Sir, it's okay.
Well, I got to hand it to you, Spencer.
This is a terrific story.
There's just one problem.
Sir, it's nothing that Mike can't help us work through.
What is it?
Crocker has an airtight alibi.
He was in Chicago when Mike was killed.
Oh, he's lying.
No, I checked it out myself, sir.
He spoke at a symposium in front of 200 other people.
No, no.
Not again.
Not this time.
Hey, Dad!
Sir!
Daddy?
He wouldn't do anything stupid, would he?
Define "stupid.
" Go up to Crocker himself?
Trish, come on!
Children, no running!
Jane!
So nice to see you.
You, too.
How do you do?
Mort Crocker, you're under arrest for the murder ofZoe Sharp and Mike McMillan.
Mr. Connors, I'm so glad you could make it.
Why don't you help yourself to a drink?
No, no, no, no.
You might fool all ofthese people, but not me.
Is everything all right, darling?
Everything's fine.
Please go back to Captain Connors, sir, why don't you let us take you home?
Pardon us for the disturbance.
Oh, crap!
Hey!
Connors!
Oh, come on!
Stop acting like a child!
Dad?
Bless you.
Thank you.
Shh!
He was here.
Well, of course he's here.
We saw him come in, Sherlock.
No, no.
Not Connors.
Mike.
Mike McMillan was here.
What?
But you sound all muffled.
What are you eating something?
How can Right, right, right.
My bad.
My bad.
He was muffled.
It was my fault.
There.
There, that's so much better.
Please get out of here now.
I don't allow anyone inside my greenhouse.
Well, that's not exactly true, now, is it?
You let Mike McMillan in, didn't you?
I mean, this is where you killed him.
You see, when Mike's spirit started talking about Crocker, I thought he meant Mr. Crocker, but it wasn't.
He was talking about Mrs. Crocker.
Well, for your sake, you had better be right this time.
He came to see you, but you weren't here.
What?
Mike, you know I don't speak Italian.
Shoes.
He wants you to check the shoes that he was wearing that day.
The soles.
You'll find potting soil in the tread that matches that stuff.
Edna, what's he talking about?
Edna?
God damn it!
That's why I know the name.
Before you were married, your name was Edna De Soto!
And you and your brother John, the park ranger, were in this together.
He used the lion to cover your tracks.
You're not really going to believe this old fool, are you?
Watch who you're calling What?
I'm sorry, that was my fault, I just wasn't paying attention to you.
Are you serious?
It's in a bird feeder?
No, I'll say it.
There's a surveillance camera out front.
Apparently it's in a bird feeder.
If the tape wasn't erased, you'll be able to see him arriving on the day he was killed.
Please, Edna, tell me you didn't.
What was I supposed to do?
Someone had to protect everything we've worked so hard for!
You would have given him half of everything!
Just like you would have his mother.
He was my son!
Detective, arrest this woman, and while you're at it, issue a warrant for the arrest of John De Soto, for the murder of Zoe Sharp and Mike McMillan.
Officers, you heard the captain.
Get them out of here.
Dad, I'm so proud of you.
Showoff.
Good for you.
Yeah, thanks.
It's a real honor, you know.
I thought these days were long gone.
Does that mean you're coming out of retirement?
What, are you kidding?
I'm lucky if I come out of the fog.
Well, you gotta keep your brain stimulated.
Try the crosswords.
Nah, I like that Sudoku.
Well, we could always go after cold cases.
Nah, best leave it to the young guys, huh?
Thanks for giving him this day.
I hope he remembers it tomorrow.
He couldn't let go and move on, you know?
Shawn?
Yeah?
What?
I'm sorry, I A little Little lump in my throat.
Speaking of lumps Yes?
The ostrich?
The tennis ball?
What?
You know what?
It's not a big deal, obviously.
But it always bugged me a little.
Why didn't you say anything, Trish?
Like what?
Oh, I don't know.
"I threw the tennis ball into the highly restricted ostrich area, "and I let you take the fall for it.
" You're serious.
It's not too late to make it right.
Right is right.
You really still have not grown up, have you?
Wow.
Goodbye, Shawn.
Gus.
What?
Hey!
There she is!
Hey!
No, no, here.
There, are you happy?
Yeah, actually, I am.
Good.
Good?
You really want me to believe that you put your foot in your mouth deliberately?
Please.
Go get the girl.
It's your move.
No.
Listen, would you go Shawn, I told you.
I do not need you to lay back for me to get a girl.
Get over there.
No.
Show her the abs.
Show her the abs.
Not until you challenge me straight up!
Fine.
I will be kissing Trish in 10 minutes.
Not if I get there first.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
I need 80 cents.
No, you don't.
You need to put back two of those extra candy bars that you just picked up.
Dad, you don't understand.
I can't put back one of these.
That would be like saying one of these candy bars is less worthy than the others.
And I can't play those kinds of favorites.
All right, fine.
Enjoy your dilemma.
In the meantime, don't drag Gus into it.
Thanks, Mr. Spencer.
No problem.
Switch places with me.
No.
Why not?
Because then you'll try to take whatever money I have left.
And when have I tried to do that to you?
Wednesday and Saturday.
Monday.
Gosh, you guys have scary memories.
Next in line, please.
That's you.
No.
Shawn, come on.
That's you.
Okay, so, all of these?
Oh, my gosh!
It happened here?
The one-millionth customer.
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry, kid.
You won!
He won?
He won what?
All kinds of things.
Gift certificates, that cool bike up there.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have it!
Our one-millionth customer!
Can I use one of my gift certificates now?
Sure.
Cool!
Isn't it awesome?
Isn't this cool, Gus?
How lucky am I?
Thanks for doing this.
Oh, don't be silly.
Are you kidding?
Go out spur of the moment with a sexy gal who likes quirky dive bars as a starting point but then is also open to seeing where the night goes, you know?
You could've thought I was weird asking you out because you walked by my counter.
I don't call that weird.
I call that blind, dumb, stupid, awe-inspired luck.
I'm gonna get drinks.
Two vodka sodas.
I've just decided I am going to experience life.
You know, try new things.
I signed up for a painting class today.
You know, they make the kind of paint you can eat now.
And I'm giving new focus to my job.
So Can I ask you a question?
Anything.
Did you just get out of a relationship?
How did you know?
Just a wild guess.
Was it today?
Yesterday.
Are you sure you should be out dating already?
Yes, of course.
He was cheating on me.
Cheating?
Yeah.
And the stupid thing is I thought everything was going really well, you know?
And then he just started getting all weird the last month.
Lying, going through my stuff, my address book, my jewelry.
Finally, Friday he tells me he's going to watch the game at a friend's.
A co-worker of mine spots him over at the Eastland center.
He may not accept it yet, but we are definitely finished.
Thank you.
I hope you don't mind being a rebound.
Oh, I usually prefer it.
But not in this case.
Why not?
Primarily because he's not cheating on you.
Look, he took your jewelry because he's trying to figure out your ring size.
He took you to Tiffany's to buy that fancy necklace because he's really trying to scout out what kind of stones and settings you like.
What about last Friday?
Oh, come on.
The Eastland center?
There's no bars or clubs there.
He wasn't there with a chick.
He was probably in the north side of the parking lot at Robbins Bros.
, picking out the ring.
My address book?
Called your parents to ask for your hand.
He's doing it right.
Do you think I should call him?
I'll let you be a psychic on that one.
Ray?
Yeah, I need you to tell me the truth.
If you lie to me, we will never speak again, do you understand?
About Friday.
Who were you with?
Take your time.
Lassy?
Spencer.
Why am I surprised?
Why are you wasted?
Hey, do you like Scotch?
Miss!
Can I get two more of these, please?
Thank you.
Listen, there is something I have got to get off my chest.
Is it your shirt?
Please say no.
You astound me.
Come again?
It's beyond astounding.
It is some of the most impressive reasoning I've ever seen.
Is there a punch line coming?
Let's get to it.
I don't know how you do it.
I mean, it's not psychic-ness, we both know that's a crock of crap.
But you, sir, are unstoppable, guaranteed arrest.
What's happening here?
Can I tell you a secret?
I wouldn't recommend it, no.
Listen, you know how everyone thinks my wife and I have been separated for nine months?
Yes.
Two years.
Two years tonight.
And I'm the one who keeps trying to fix the thing.
I mean Jeez.
counseling, therapy, acupuncture, you name it.
I have tried to try to try it.
Well, I'm gonna let you go.
Don't drive.
You know, I used to be a good cop.
Seriously.
Stunning arrest record.
It was one of the best in the department.
I caught the Back Bay killer.
Yes, you did.
I remember it well.
Although I had a tip.
The blue sedan.
Yeah.
That was you?
It might have been.
See what I mean?
Come on, you still had to put it all together, right?
Look, Spencer, the blue sedan was the key to the whole thing.
It was the murderer's car.
Yeah, but who had to run the plates?
And all those numbers and letters could have confused many a cop.
Spencer, stop, okay?
I am done.
Here, I want you to have these.
I don't need them.
I am over.
All right, just stop this.
This is nonsense.
You're not over.
Look, you're a striking man with strong features, eyes that women want to do cannonballs into.
You have great posture and penmanship the likes I've never seen.
No, I have officially hit rock bottom.
A month ago, I got this case, right?
A healthy 42-year-old astronomer dies.
Doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, spends all day in an ergonomically-designed chair, charting the night sky.
Natural causes, that's what the Coroner comes back with.
Does a full autopsy.
No red flags.
Nothing.
I know he was murdered.
I just can't What?
What?
What is this?
prove it!
The department won't even let me pursue it.
Come on, you'll figure it out.
No, I won't.
I can't.
And I've accepted that.
All right, look, Lassy Carlton, I believe in you.
I really do.
You just gotta trust your instincts.
I just got engaged!
Oh, my God!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
I got engaged!
I'll never, ever see you again.
Bye.
Stick with it, Lassy.
You You can solve this thing.
You're halfway there already.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Check this out.
What?
Hey, Lassy.
What is it, Spencer?
How you doing?
You okay?
All right.
I'll bite.
What's the joke?
Just want to make sure you got home all right last night.
From what?
From the bar.
What bar?
You were at a bar?
No, I wasn't at a bar.
I don't drink.
You don't drink?
Well, okay.
Wine at weddings.
Occasional snifter of brandy.
Maybe a single-malt scotch.
Sounds like drinking to me.
Spencer, why don't you stop making up stories, okay?
They're obviously bogus.
Okay, so you were not at Tom Blair's Pub last night?
I don't even know who Tom Blair is.
Mmm-hmm.
And how'd you get that sweet bruise on your forehead?
I had an altercation.
Yes, with a table.
With a suspect.
If we're done, I would really like to move on with my day.
I get it.
Yesterday was a tough anniversary for you.
What?
Who've you been talking to?
Nobody.
I'll get out of your hair.
Okay.
We gotta solve that case.
What case?
The one Lassiter can't solve.
He's gonna hire us for a case?
Oh, God, no.
He'd never do that.
So, we won't get paid?
Exactly.
And we're just doing it for the glory?
Nope.
We give Lassiter all the credit.
In fact, I don't even think he can know we're helping him.
Dude, that's a good idea, Shawn.
I ditch out of work on the day we release three new products to spend time on an unsolvable case in which we won't get paid and someone else gets all the credit.
That, quite honestly, is some of the best nut-shelling I've ever heard.
We made a deal.
Yesterday.
We're equal partners.
That means we collectively decide which appointments to make, which cases to take.
We have to live by that, at least for a day, especially today.
You're right.
Thank you.
It's gonna be a problem, though.
Why?
'Cause we've already got a meeting with the dead guy's widow.
When?
Ten minutes.
Ten minutes?
Look, don't worry.
I'm gonna do it in the Chief's office.
Just need you to stand guard at the door, make sure no one catches us in there.
It's gonna double the excitement.
Maybe triple it.
Now, come on, who's in?
Don't fool around.
You know I can't hold my hand like this for very long.
Gus, I get very poor circulation to the limbic regions.
And now my pinky's going numb.
I guess everything started to change at the beginning of last summer.
He partnered with his old friend, Hugo, and they finally got accepted for eight months on the new digital telescope at the Space Center.
Everything was normal for two weeks and then, suddenly, Bryant started to work really long hours.
I see.
What do you think of this?
I like it.
It was a gift.
A friend.
He's a glass blower.
Would you say that's when he started feeling sick, Mary?
Not sick, just a little off.
Oh!
We did cancel our Fourth of July trip, so I guess it was around that time.
I'm sorry, something is really bugging me.
Your name is Lassiter, too?
Yes, that's correct.
Carlton Lassiter.
But you're not affiliated with the detective Carlton Lassiter who I met before?
Not in any way, shape or form.
Different department.
Matter of fact, I spell mine with a "K".
Two of them.
Mary, is there anything you're leaving out?
Maybe something that's slipped your mind, something you're not telling me because it may embarrass and/or shame you.
It could be vital.
I know this probably isn't true, but I started to suspect that he Was cheating on you.
Well, yes.
How did you know?
A shot in the dark.
The long hours.
He was consumed with his work.
He was different.
Distant.
I don't even like to say it out loud.
Please, don't.
Bryant wasn't really the type.
We were planning a future.
He wanted to try for a baby.
He was a good man.
Thanks again for coming in, Mary.
No problem, Kkarlton.
If we uncover any Carlton?
Yes, Karlton, with a "K".
Two "K"s.
The second one is silent.
May I speak to you privately in your office, Kkarlton?
Certainly.
We'll be in touch.
Thanks.
What are you doing reopening the Vallery case?
Reopening?
Come on.
That word has so many syllables.
That case was determined not to be a case, despite Detective Lassiter's best efforts.
Shawn!
Now, I need a whole lot of an explanation from you, because, although you do make me laugh occasionally, impersonating an officer is Impersonating an officer?
Please.
I told that woman I was in accounts payable.
Shawn, come clean.
I would like to solve this case for Lassiter.
He'll never allow it.
That's why he can't know I'm involved.
I figure I can guide him through this thing, right?
Build him up, get him back on his feet again.
You're serious?
Yeah.
Why?
I just feel like he really needs this.
I mean, look at him.
Okay, I'm in.
You're what?
What do you got?
My Dad is not answering his phone.
So?
So, he's always home, and he always answers his phone after two rings.
This is actually somewhat troubling.
Why?
Why?
Fish Derby is on.
What is this?
It's the Bryant Vallery case.
The one from this morning?
And the rest of the week.
I predict we will solve it Friday at 10:01 p. m. and then maybe watch some cable.
Sounds great.
And did you find a partner that's willing to do this with you?
Jules is in.
My Dad is clearly missing, or something.
Dude, that leaves you!
Gus, you get to step up in a big fat way.
You have one job.
I have two jobs, Shawn.
I have presentations to memorize on three new drugs.
And while you were out drinking last night and taking on free cases, I was up half the night dreaming about whether the gel caps are more effective than the tablets.
First of all, tablets.
Always tablets, that's a given.
Secondly, I've been having this reoccurring dream where I'm flying over Auckland on the back of a swan made primarily of cocoa.
His name is Clem.
But your dream was pretty interesting, too.
And thirdly, I guarantee you that after you hear this reason, you will definitely want to take this case.
I doubt it but give it a shot.
The victim was an astronomer.
Yeah.
The guy died while he was working the night sky at the observatory.
What would make you think that would matter?
Oh, come on!
I know you go down to the Space Center.
That's preposterous, Shawn.
Thursdays.
I'm never down In the afternoon, usually around 2:00.
Have you been following me?
Maybe.
Sometimes.
To sharpen and refine my tailing skills, yes.
This is exactly the sort of thing I was talking about, Shawn.
Okay, I apologize, Gus, I do.
But it's all good.
So you like astronomy.
I accept that.
This conversation is over.
Okay, don't go all Vincent Gallo on me.
We're just getting started, man.
Look, some guy dies at a Space Center that you frequently sneak off to.
We gotta get down there and we gotta do some serious space digging.
No, we don't.
As a matter of fact, now that I know that you're tailing me while I'm at work, get ready to get lost in my dust.
Okay.
Dust?
What, are you going off-roading?
I'm gonna be un-catchable, like a jackal.
Like a jackal?
How about I just tail you to the observatory?
Consider me stealth, Shawn.
That's weird.
It's like you're a bobble head.
Excuse me, I have an annual pass and Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
Didn't see you standing there, you know, being so stealth-like.
The Jackal has arrived.
What are you doing, Shawn?
What are we doing.
Dude, we're undercover.
We are not undercover.
Sure, we are.
I'm the employee, you're the customer.
I am the customer.
See?
You're already in character, like Don Cheadle!
I'm not involved with this case.
I only need you for a minute.
Like when Kenickie needed Danny Zuko.
And you get to be Travolta in the analogy.
Tomorrow, they're training me on the motion simulator.
Tell me you've never wanted to take a ride on one of those things buck-naked.
No, I haven't.
Sure you have.
I'm only here for a few minutes, anyway.
That's all I need.
Look, there's this creepy janitor that lurks about.
I want you to distract him while I grill planetarium girl.
You are not grilling Jessica.
She's just interning here until she gets her college units.
Jessica?
Yeah!
How do you know her name is Oh, Gus.
What?
You haven't been coming here on Thursdays to study the stars.
You've been coming here for her!
Do you love her?
Shut up, Shawn.
You're in love with her.
Shut up, Shawn.
I'm gonna go hook you guys up.
No, Shawn.
She is my co-worker and I have the inside track.
Listen, there are ways to go about doing this.
You don't just walk up to somebody at their place of employment and start working them over.
You've got to have a plan.
Do you have a plan?
Of course I have a plan.
Well, would you mind clueing me in, please?
All right, listen.
She's been through a lot lately.
She just had Broke up with her boyfriend.
How'd you know that?
It's my curse, apparently.
Well, since she's just off a break-up, I gotta move gradually.
Just go over there and ask her out.
Get her digits.
Shawn, this is a quality girl.
That means I got to put in quality time, okay?
Oh, here she comes.
Act natural.
Hey, Jessie, do you know Gus?
Yes.
Gus is a regular.
That's right.
You know, I went to high school with him.
Of course, I didn't hang out with cool kids like Gus in high school.
He was a CIF wrestling champion back then.
Really?
True as toast.
And in college, he was a Heisman candidate till he blew his knee out.
Don't act all surprised.
We were all following you in the newspapers, man.
You're kidding.
Well, he is, actually.
I don't kid, ever.
I idolize this guy.
The coolest dude I have ever known.
Wow, Gus, it seems there's a lot I don't know about you.
Well, there is Hey, you guys should totally talk, you know?
Share stuff and whatnot.
But don't let this guy grill you too much.
Yeah, well, I'd love to, but I have to start the planetarium show.
Yes, she has a planetarium show to start.
Oh, can I do that?
Have you been trained on the show?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Jess, I just did the checklist, like, an hour ago.
Perfect score.
Uh Question 18 has a typo.
Okay, great!
Go ahead then.
Are you serious?
Oh, this is great!
Great.
All right, I got it.
No worries.
No worries.
I got it.
Thanks, Shawn.
That guy.
You heard about Pluto?
It's messed up, right?
Mmm-hmm.
Here's the Bryant Vallery file.
The what?
Wait The astronomer?
Yes, and I just finished the follow-up with Mary, the widow.
You what?
You asked me to.
I did?
It was in passing.
And wow, did it ever pay off!
You were right about the affair.
I was?
Yeah, the wife totally suspected it.
She what?
That he potentially was having an affair.
Well, isn't that interesting?
I want to re-interview everybody.
And get me a copy of the Coroner's report.
I told you there was more to this case.
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
I will be your narrator.
My name is Aurora Borealis.
There are over 400 stars in our galaxy.
Maybe more.
No one knows for sure.
Many have said that the universe is even larger than the Indian Ocean.
And that is why it is called Infinitum Staroctopusium.
Ah, yes.
Our glorious constellations.
There they all are.
Take a look.
Over here we have one with a guy holding some sort of thing.
Over here, our beloved Olympic rings, all seven of them.
And here Here's one with a fish.
You gotta name them.
Notice straight Straight above you, the Hammer of Jeff.
And over there in the south North.
North, you will see Monkey with Rash.
The Egyptians used to set their clocks by him.
Oh look!
There goes an asteroid.
Comet.
Comet!
It's what they named that cleaning solution after.
I know it may stink when you leave it in the sink but, boy, oh boy, does it clean!
Is there a reason you're standing so close to me?
Just looking.
Yeah, well, that's the great thing about looking, you can do it from far, far away.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I implore you to enjoy the majesty of the heavens.
Hey.
You work here?
No, I just happen to own my own space suit.
A smart-ass.
I like that.
Get over here, kid.
Do me a favor.
Keep your finger on the space bar while I adjust this.
Like this?
Uh-huh.
You're gonna trust me with this?
I don't have a lot of other options, do I, space man?
I gotta be honest.
This seems like a job for two, no?
Sometimes it is.
But once the scope is in place, all you got to do is watch the monitor, hoping to catch things that nobody else has.
You know, if you got a partner, you can switch off, you know, rest your eyes, maybe make calculations on what you've seen, or just break up the silence of staring into the unknown.
So, where's your partner?
Yeah, well that's the bad part of it.
He passed away not too long ago.
You know, the Buddhists have this saying about moving on, honoring the work But I don't remember it.
What I do know is that I realize I'm too old to be doing this stuff all alone.
So, you're continuing the work, huh?
Bryant would return from the grave if I didn't.
You know, we petitioned for five years for use of this scope.
And we got lucky.
No, no, no.
No, no.
Don't touch, no.
I mean, once you get in here, you gotta find what you're looking for, fast.
We had eight months.
Bryant saw six.
Eight months seems like a good chunk of time.
Not in astronomy.
See, once you find it, you gotta track it.
Okay?
And then it's not a discovery until you chart it and then it goes around again and then you prove it.
Must get lonely.
I let you in here, didn't I?
Look, I just talk.
You know?
I've got the gift of gab.
Jeez, I'll talk to anybody, I suppose.
So, you still haven't found what you're looking for, huh?
No, but when I do, you'll read about it, believe me.
You'll read about it.
My real goal is to become an astronomer.
See something no one else has.
I don't even need to make a big, flashy discovery, or name a star, or become famous like most of these guys want.
Yeah.
All I've ever really wanted is to know I made a difference.
That's great, knowing what you want to do since you were a kid.
That's a gift.
Thanks.
You know, you're a great listener, Gus.
Oh, well, it's easy to talk to you, Jessica.
I mean, it's Is something wrong?
They've been in there 45 minutes.
So?
It's a four-minute show.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is precisely why time travel is not only possible, but may have already happened.
So, I met the other astronomer.
Nice guy.
Chatty.
Hiding something.
Something nefarious?
I don't know yet.
How'd you do?
Please, Shawn.
How do you think?
Digits?
You know this.
Nice!
We're going out tomorrow.
It's all coming together, man.
Juliet called.
She ran our dead guy's phone records.
We gotta meet her at the station.
You bet, let's go.
Whoa!
Not now.
Why 5:00?
Gus, I can't just leave willy-nilly whenever I want.
I have a job to do here.
I don't care what the Coroner says.
Healthy hearts do not just stop.
But you know what?
I got a golf buddy who's a cardiologist.
I'm gonna run these by him.
Mind the store, I'll be back.
Hey!
Okay, so we ran the home, the work, and the cell phone records of Bryant Vallery.
We got nothing on the home phone, a few strange hits on the work line, but when we ran the cell phone, we hit the jackpot.
We found a number that he calls, only from his cell phone, all hours of the night, way too often for business.
Unless it's monkey business.
Sweet!
So we contacted the cell phone company for the name.
The number is 555-019 Where is it?
Oh, here it is.
Nine?
Wow, that's good.
Not really.
So, she had an affair with a married guy and probably lied about it.
That doesn't mean she's guilty.
Shawn, you're confusing me.
You're the one who loves to jump to conclusions, and you're not even hopping towards this one.
Hopping?
It doesn't track, Gus.
Why would she kill him?
She broke up with a guy.
It's him.
He dumped her.
So, why doesn't she mention to you that her ex-boyfriend just bit the dust?
What's she gonna say?
"Hey, how's it going?
My boyfriend just died.
"He might have been killed.
Maybe it was me.
" I doubt she chortles.
Damn, she was so damn good-looking.
And she still is, Gus.
Even if we have a who, we don't have a clear motive and we certainly don't have the method.
We can't give up on our other suspects.
What we need to do is keep looking.
You're gonna set off the alarm.
Clearly, I have a security pass.
They gave you a security pass?
They gave Dave the cheddar corn guy a security pass, I merely stumbled upon it by happenstance.
And by happenstance, you mean?
I swiped it from his gym bag while he was shaking a Milky Way loose from the vending machine.
Damn it!
I What are you doing, Shawn?
What I don't have is a key.
That's not right.
What?
I'm sorry.
I just I I left my pogo stick in there and I just No, I mean you're not doing it right.
You gotta move upward if you wanna get the latch to disengage.
Let me do it.
Uh Don't you have a key for that, or For this room?
No.
Big bad Bryant took it away a few weeks after they got here.
Why?
A few small items go missing and suddenly everyone gets suspicious.
Items such as?
A watch.
A comb.
Some mail.
Whose mail?
The dead guy, Bryant.
Did you read it?
Well, of course I did.
You know, he became quite a jerk.
I don't know if Hugo knows this or not, but he was dissolving the partnership.
Apparently, he had some big plans for himself.
I don't know.
Correspondence for jobs he didn't seem qualified for, heading university departments, NASA NASA?
Now.
Who are you guys again?
We think something bad went down in there.
Yes, something bad did go down in here.
Did you see anything?
No.
But you know, the dead guy, he changed.
They were friends at the beginning.
Hugo was always being nice to him, you know?
In fact, Hugo's the only one around here who's nice to me.
Brings me coffee in the mornings, although he brings it for everybody, all four of us.
Three of us.
Stallings, I'll be nice to you, just do me a favor.
Stop stealing the gum out of my locker.
Okay?
You spotted that?
Sure did.
Hey, do you know how these books work?
Oh, they switch up every couple of hours.
One looks, one writes.
Yeah, they do it from dark till dusk all the time.
Hugo's here.
How do you know that?
He gets here at the same time every day.
You could set your clock to it.
Hey, you should hurry.
You don't have long.
Thanks, dude.
Uh-huh.
Gus, come check this out.
What?
Look, there's a page missing from this logbook.
I noticed it the first time I was here.
Look.
June 21st.
What does the book track?
It's like Stallings said.
It's like, every manual adjustment they make, who does it, which guy was on the scope.
See, it looks like they switch shifts about every two hours.
Right?
So, why remove this page?
It goes from 8:39 with Hugo to 10:42 with Bryant.
So the question is, what happened between 8:39 and 10:42 on June 21st?
Some bad juju.
We gotta get out of here.
Why?
Why?
Gus, someone finds me in here, I could get fired.
Why do you keep running like that?
Hey, you guys.
Hey.
What's up?
Gus, about tonight Oh, if you have other obligations, that's cool.
No, I just wanted to see if we could go at 6:30 instead.
That's perfect.
That's even better.
Look, I need to borrow your motorcycle tonight.
You can use my little blue car.
Oh, yeah!
Do that, Gus.
I get a little nervous on motorcycles.
Settled!
Bye, Jess.
Bye.
Think you want this one.
What's that in his case?
Tracking readouts.
Dude, it's just a bunch of paperwork.
I saw it at the observatory.
Why does he keep it locked up like that?
That's a good question.
Morning, gentlemen.
You up already?
I had to check the timers on the crab spray.
You need any help with that giant thing?
Nah, I can manage it.
Only got two more weeks of this before my time's up.
Might as well follow it through to the end.
You know what that means.
I have no idea what that means.
That means he's not at his house.
So?
Rainier's not exactly a high roller, huh?
No.
Look at that.
It should say, "Welcome to camp something.
" Huh!
Stargazing isn't the most lucrative field.
Well, you can make up to a hundred grand a year on the lecture circuit if you're a name.
You're gonna break that.
I don't think so!
Whoa!
What?
Oh, boy!
What is this awful purple stuff?
They're flowers.
Flowers?
It's a garden.
It's a vegetable garden.
These are flowers, weird flowers.
What are you doing?
Well, I gotta check this out.
Let Lassiter do that.
Gus, Lassiter has to come here on his own.
And he has gotta be right.
So, who you gonna get to check that out for us?
Well, who else do you know who spends all day in his yard?
Shawn!
Oh, you shouldn't have.
Dad, we need to talk business.
You're not answering your phone.
What's going on?
Did you even check it?
My phone's been fine, Shawn.
I'm just a little busy right now.
Busy with what?
Things, Shawn.
I have things.
Henry, where are the towels?
Yeah, I'll tell you in a minute.
Was that a woman?
You have a woman in there?
What do you think?
Where did you meet a woman?
Are you really interested?
It's a question, Dad.
It's an enquiry.
On the Internet.
Shawn, look, she's a very nice lady.
Her name is Sylvia.
She runs a catering business, has two kids.
Would you like to meet her?
Oh, God, no!
Are you kidding?
Good.
Can we pick this up tomorrow?
Yeah, I'd be glad to.
Good.
You must have thought your Dad dated again.
Honestly, Gus, I haven't given it a lot of thought.
It's been 15 years.
Yeah, you know what?
It's fine.
It's great.
Good for him.
You wanna talk about it?
No.
Good.
You left your plant there.
I know.
Wanna go back and get it?
No.
Okay, June 21st is missing from the logbook?
No, I'll check on that right away.
Sweet.
So, does Lassiter need any more help?
No, Shawn, he is on fire.
He's already had the autopsy test rerun, and he's contacted every relative he had.
Is that a personal call, O'Hara?
Yes.
Wrap it up.
I think I'm onto something.
I think he was killed by someone he knew.
I gotta go.
Bryant Vallery opened a safety deposit box account in June.
Was it around June 21st?
What was June 21st?
I don't know.
Didn't you say something about June 21st yesterday?
I've said so many things in the last few days.
Refresh my memory.
Dude, you look sharp.
Thank you.
I've got one more thing for you.
What's that?
You want me to wear a wire?
Just this little baby one.
Look, in the event that she actually did it, right?
She's not gonna suspect you.
Forget it, Shawn.
I'm gonna sit down with her for 30 minutes, ask a few questions and keep it cool, just in case.
Just in case she didn't kill the guy.
All right, here's a compromise.
Let me follow you.
No.
Come on!
From a safe distance.
It'll be like, 30 yards.
Consider me stealth, Shawn.
Hey, be careful.
You know, we have a mirror in the bathroom.
You seem jumpy.
Me?
Oh, no.
No, no.
I'm excited.
So Tell me about this guy you just broke up with.
Exes?
Ooh!
Don't you know the number one rule of first dates, Gus?
I'm very comfortable talking about anything.
Well, there's not much to tell, really.
Mmm-hmm.
About a month in, I find out he's married.
Right.
Just my luck.
And then he kept calling.
He actually thought I'd be okay with the whole dirty scenario.
He just He wasn't the guy I thought he was, in a lot of ways.
Wow, that's That's great.
Why?
I don't know.
Hey, I'm sorry about having to go earlier.
It's just everything changed at the observatory and I gotta get to work early tomorrow, so What's going on?
Well, don't tell anyone, but Hugo and Bryant may have discovered a planet.
Get out of here!
Yeah!
An extra-solar planet.
About six months ago, I think.
Bryant kinda clued me in the night they found it.
He was so excited.
They had to track their data, wait for the planet to come around again and complete its orbit.
Right.
So, it must be verified now.
I mean, you don't just call a press conference for nothing, right?
Hugo is over the moon.
Yeah, he's gonna be famous forever.
Do you have any idea how huge this is for someone's career?
Um Of course he does.
Shawn?
I was in stealth mode!
How did you find me?
You knew he was following you?
No, not at all.
Jessica, this is a good thing.
It means we don't suspect you anymore.
"We"?
Suspect me of what?
I didn't think you killed him, Jessica.
Killed?
And I hope this doesn't create trust issues for our future.
We just needed to establish motive.
Dude, we totally established motive!
Well, congratulations, Gus, whatever you are.
You've got your motive, whatever that is, but you no longer have a date.
No.
Jessie!
Jessica, hold on a sec!
Gus!
Man, that's twice!
and to the Santa Barbara Space Center for the use of their facility.
I dedicate this to my departed comrade, Bryant Vallery.
Professor!
Professor!
When was the discovery made?
The 21st of June, between my partner and myself.
While readjusting some coordinates, I inadvertently made what is certainly the discovery of my lifetime.
Which one of you made the actual discovery?
It was me.
We traded off chairs every two hours.
This was completely by accident.
What about a book?
Surely you'll have a lot of book offers.
Gus, you know what this means?
It's murder.
It's No, it's motive.
That's what I said.
No, you said, "It's murder.
" It's the same thing.
Motive, murder, it's the same thing.
No, motive is the reason for doing it.
It's in the same family, Shawn.
Shh!
Shh!
Now, this planet has everything required for an Earth-like structure.
It has proximity, it has the right orbit, it has its own energy source You've got to change that phone setting.
Jeez.
Hello.
Shawn, what the hell do you think you're doing?
Look, Dad, I can't talk to you about your love life, okay?
I can't do it.
My love life?
You still on that?
I'm talking about this foxglove you left on my porch.
Foxglove?
Your little plant with the dirty roots.
It's all over my welcome mat.
That was foxglove?
What the hell is foxglove?
Some neighbor's cat could have wandered in, chewed on it and croaked right in my front yard, Shawn.
Some foxglove has a chemical called digitalis in its leaves.
What, is it, like, poison?
It's a medicine!
And you know how I feel about dead things in my yard.
Look, Dad, I'm sorry.
I gotta go, I can't have two people solving my case at once.
Shawn, we should talk.
Okay, fine.
I'll be at Tom Blair's Pub on Friday.
Come by.
I got a date on Friday.
Can you do Saturday?
Never mind.
Digitalis is prescribed for heart conditions.
I don't see how that helps us, Gus.
It can cause toxicity in someone who doesn't have a heart problem.
Wouldn't that show up in the autopsy?
That's the problem.
You have to test for digitalis specifically.
No one would consider it if someone doesn't have a history of heart problems.
Shh!
Hey, what are you doing here?
We just got our motive for murder, Spencer.
Hugo found out that Vallery was gonna take all the credit for their discovery himself.
Cut him out of it entirely.
Because he was on the scope when they made the find?
Yes.
Maybe.
What are you doing here?
Well, we heard you had the motive, so we rushed down here to volunteer our services.
Thanks, but I'll take this one myself.
Okay, well at least tell me about the poison.
What poison?
I didn't say anything about poison.
You most certainly did.
I heard it.
Clear as day.
Must have slipped out.
I have been thinking about poison as a method, but I can't figure out how.
Would you like me to read your innermost thoughts?
Like deep, deep, deep ones.
Knock yourself out.
Okay, I just want you to relax.
Breathe normally.
Close your eyes.
Can you feel it?
Can Can You want to check the house, Hugo's house.
I am in the process of getting a warrant.
What did he say?
He's in the process of getting a warrant now.
The garden, check the garden.
It's buried there?
Something's growing.
Oh, I'm getting something.
I'm getting I'm getting Oh, oh, oh Prince!
No.
The artist formerly known as Prince.
Shawn!
Wrong again.
It's Prince after he was known as "the artist formerly known as Prince.
" It's purple.
Yes!
Yes!
That's it!
You're amazing.
Oh, the caverns of knowledge in that thing.
Here's the problem.
We ran the toxicology report.
There's no trace of poisoning.
Of course.
Thank you, Detective.
So what you're saying is, he would've had to administer it very, very slowly.
Yes.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
How do you poison someone slowly?
He brings me coffee.
Although, he brings it for everybody.
All four of us.
Three of us.
Coffee.
No, I'm good.
Tea.
Well, if you're going.
It had to be the tea.
The leaves wouldn't stand out in the tea.
Hugo poisoned his tea.
Every day for six months.
Digitalis would cause arrhythmia in a healthy heart.
Which would disappear as soon as someone died.
Solved it!
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.
Oh, that's right.
You did.
O'Hara, call the Coroner.
Tell him to check for even the slightest traces of digitalis.
And get me a new pair of handcuffs.
I've gotta be off.
Hi.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Just part of the job.
Spencer, a moment of your precious time.
Are you sure we should be in here?
That night in the bar, I mentioned my wife, didn't I?
Yes.
Oh, crap.
What did I say, exactly?
That she wants you back.
No, no, I don't think I said that.
Maybe I sensed that.
You didn't sense it either, but thanks for trying to help.
To tell you the truth, I think I got some help on this case.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, hey, man, we all get help sometimes, right?
It's the truly great ones that know how to accept it.
And if I may add one more thing, Detective, you astound me.
Second half to that joke?
No.
No?
The press is asking for you outside.
Tell them I will be right there.
To tell you the truth, Spencer, sometimes I astound myself.
How's the knot?
Tight.
Great.
All alone, huh?
That would appear to be the case.
It's a Friday night.
What happened to Sylvia?
Would you believe that I didn't want to hurt your feelings?
Sit down.
Have a drink.
You buying?
You kidding?
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Shawn!
Stop.
Turn around.
Turn around.
What are you hiding?
Did you get in a fight, Shawn?
Kind of.
Kind of?
What do you mean, kind of?
What did I tell you about fighting?
Get over here, son.
Take a look at that.
You really got punched.
Here, hold that on your eye.
All right, tell me, what's the name of this kid who hit you?
Elizabeth.
You got in a fight with a girl?
Well, it wasn't really a fight.
She just punched me.
Why in the world would she punch you?
What happened?
She asked me to sit next to her at lunch and I did.
And then I was eating my Tater Tots and she just punched me.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
What was she doing while you were eating your Tater Tots?
I don't know.
She was talking about something.
What?
What was she talking about?
I have no idea.
She just went on and on and I was concentrating on my Tater Tots.
I'll be damned.
Shawn, I know what happened.
You just had your first date.
Sit.
Sit.
My first what?
Look, obviously this Elizabeth girl likes you.
That's why she invited you over to sit next to her.
Then why'd she sock me in the eye?
Because she likes you and you didn't listen to her story.
Women want you to listen to them, Shawn.
They want you to pick up every small detail, they want you to compliment them.
It's about tuning in to people.
It's about getting inside their heads and anticipating their needs.
And this applies to all aspects of life.
Not only this girl Elizabeth, but even your barber.
But I don't want to date the barber.
Shawn, I know that one day all of this is going to make sense to you.
You just have to believe me.
For now, I'm going to leave you with one very simple rule.
Under no circumstances ever, ever do you mention to a woman her age or her weight.
Nobody breathe.
I've got it.
I've got it in grams and I've got it in minutes.
Just give me a second here.
Do a little converting.
I got it.
That was amazing.
How did you do that?
I have to admit though, sadly, it's just a teensy bit higher in the weight department.
Oh, you know what?
That's my bad.
I believe I was getting a future reading from next week.
It happens.
I apologize.
Wait.
I'm also getting a dance belt.
You are my head detective.
And fishnet stockings.
But that's this guy.
That's this guy here.
Shawn.
Shawn.
I'm kidding.
You're such a good sport.
Everybody loves you.
Hey, Spencer.
Lassy face.
Got the perfect case for you guys.
I'm sorry.
You're saying that you want our help?
Yeah.
What's the catch?
There's no catch.
It's just right up your alley.
We could really use your insights on this one.
The guy's waiting to give you a statement.
Interrogation room B. Make me proud.
Okay.
What does that sound like to you?
An opportunity.
No.
You think Lassiter's going to just hand us over a case?
Stop.
Let's think about this for a minute.
Gus, come on.
What?
We're going to roll up our sleeves, we're going to get a little bit dirty and we're going to do some old-fashioned police work.
Come on.
This is like In the Heat of the Night.
Which makes me Carroll O'Connor.
No.
That means you're Rod Steiger.
That way, I'm Sidney Poitier.
You know that's right.
Oh, boy.
Wow.
Looks like somebody beat us to the rolling of the sleeves.
No.
What are you doing?
What?
This is our case.
He's naked.
We got to work the room.
I'm gonna work it from the outside.
You're gonna work it from in here.
Now shut the door.
Mr. Turk, is it?
My name's Shawn Spencer.
I'm the head P for the SBPD.
You're the who for the what?
Don't concern yourself with the formalities, Mr. Turk.
I'm here to take your statement and find out just what exactly happened to you.
Well, I don't really remember much.
Funny.
It says here you told the desk sergeant, you woke up naked in a field with your ass hanging out.
Yeah, that's right.
But I don't remember exactly what they look like.
You know, it's all really confusing for me right now.
When you say "they," just who are you referring to?
The aliens.
See?
Right, aliens.
Here it is.
Page two, got it.
How would you describe these aliens, Mr. Turk?
Would you say they were small?
Would you say they were green?
You know, I don't really recall right now.
I've got this headache and Who is that person over there?
Because he's really making me uncomfortable.
I'm making you uncomfortable right now?
Dude, is there any reason why you're not wearing any clothes now?
Hey, I think I might have been abducted, all right?
I believe I might have been experimented on.
So there's no way I'm going to touch these clothes and compromise evidence.
Okay, okay, Mr. Turk.
Please try to gain control of your considerable person.
Why don't you cover up with a towel?
That's why it's there.
One size fits all, I hope.
All right.
I'll cover up with the towel, but first Does somebody want to check me for scars?
Oh, good Lord.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Are you really willing to just dismiss the idea that there's life on other planets?
This is what I got.
I know he was dragged out there.
Otherwise, no sign of assault.
Nothing taken.
Aside from the embarrassment of waking up naked in a field, we've got nothing to hang our hats on.
I guess technically we could have hung our hats on his Shawn.
Sorry.
Look, if it's not the alien thing, then how do you explain the memory loss, the confusion, the fact that he saw a little green man?
Hallucinations.
No.
What?
Dude, you're the expert here.
Come on, man, there's got to be some drug that would cause a combination of those three things.
Think.
Drugs.
Oh, you're asking me?
Sure.
Let me see.
Off the top of my head, any SSRls, Tramadol, Bupropion, proton pump inhibitors.
That's what I'm talking about.
Thank you.
Venlafaxine, Ropinirole.
That's good work from you, buddy.
B- adrenoreceptor antagonists.
Okay, gold star for Gus.
Phencyclidine, Ketamine, Bofotenine.
You're not going to stop, are you?
Did I already say Venlafaxine?
There's no way to be sure.
Wait, wait a second.
Didn't he say something to you about smelling lavender?
Yeah.
He said right before he blacked out, he remembered the strong scent of lavender and seeing barbed wire.
Right.
Wait a second.
Gus, that's not a hallucination.
That's a location.
That's what I'm saying!
And I know exactly where it is.
Dude, I've driven by this place at least twice.
The question is, what are the cops doing here?
body of another male Caucasian, early 30s, possible 314.
Officers on scene.
Johnny.
Oh.
Oh.
Look, I saw the picture of that Turk guy in the paper.
Now, it's me in a field naked, headache.
You do the math.
Do you remember seeing anything out of the ordinary?
I don't remember much at all.
So, you just woke up in a field wearing nothing but your birthday suit?
Look, I told you yes already.
Are you going to give me a hard time?
'Cause I'm a little freaked out as it is.
And can somebody get me a bigger towel?
This thing is like the size of a washcloth.
What are you, some kind of pervert?
Cut him some slack.
He's just doing his job.
You think he gets his jollies taking pictures ofyour ding dong?
Lassy.
What are you guys doing here?
This is my case.
You gave it to me, remember?
Look, this is a copycat, okay?
He saw Turk's picture in the paper.
He's looking for attention.
So, he wakes up and sees Turk in the paper naked, humiliated, the butt of jokes at the water cooler and says, "Hmm, how can I make this work for myself"?
What?
Plus, it's really itchy out here.
When you get your master's degree in criminology, then you can call me.
In the meantime, I got a half-eaten Enchirito in my car.
All right, here we go.
You're up.
What?
Do it.
I'm not doing that.
Dude.
I took the fat guy in the police station.
I'm not doing that.
This is a much better pull.
I'm not doing that, Shawn.
We're partners.
Gus.
What does this case have to do with a tanning salon?
It's the middle ofwinter in Santa Barbara.
Those dudes looked like gingerbread men without tan lines.
They fake and they bake.
Shawn, exactly how close did you look at these naked guys?
Too close.
My heightened observational skills are considered a gift by most, but I'm here to tell you, it can be a burden.
How do you know it's this place?
Keiser didn't have any streaks on his buttocks, okay?
That screams the Insta-Tan process and this is the only place that does that.
Right.
Plus, they both live within a mile and a half of this joint.
Uh-huh.
I can't ring this.
Hello?
Hello?
Look, I'm going to snoop around, okay?
You find out if Turk or Keiser were here.
And if so, when?
Oh, Shawn, Shawn.
This is not going to work.
Dude, I've got to do my thing.
I've got to mix it up nice.
But You always complain you don't get to do the questiony part.
Questiony part.
Gus.
Right.
You're forgetting May I help you?
Yes.
I'm here for a tanning appointment.
For yourself?
Yes, for the Insta-Tan process.
I would like that.
But What?
You Yes.
I don't understand.
Okay, look, screw it.
I can't do it.
Have you seen either of these two guys here before?
Fred Turk or Philip Keiser?
Shawn.
Shawn.
Okay, both Turk and Keiser not only have been here, but they're regulars.
He says, it's always the single guys who try to keep up with their tans.
Single guys?
Yeah.
Maybe that's it.
Maybe some woman is targeting singles at the salon.
The question is, what kind of loser thinks getting a tan is going to help him score a woman?
Dad?
Dad, what are you doing here?
The real question is, what are you doing here?
Well, George Hamilton, we're on a case.
Or maybe you missed the pictures of the guys in the paper in the field.
Yes, of course I saw it.
The nudist guy in the field, thinks he was abducted by aliens.
Idiot.
What does that have to do with this place?
Well, they're both regulars here.
They both happen to be single, so this could be a stalking case.
Wait a second, your dad is single and he comes here all the time.
Everybody comes here.
What is that?
What?
Exfoliating scrub with pumice.
Whatever, Shawn.
All I know is, when I varnish my boat and I don't want it to streak, I sand off a layer first.
Same thing goes with tanning.
That is the single most disturbing analogy I've ever heard in my entire life.
Where are they?
Who?
The Queer Eye guys.
I know they're here somewhere.
Gus, what are their names?
How am I supposed to know, Shawn?
Carson and Jai and the guy with the glasses.
Oh, yeah, who cooks the fish.
Right.
Shawn, you know what your real problem is?
You got yourself another case and, as usual, you're short sighted.
You think it's all impressive 'cause you see a couple of nude guys in a field.
You put a fix on them here.
Well, it's not enough.
This is what we know.
Both these guys are trying to impress someone, which means a woman was involved and that same woman was with them in the field.
Shawn saw a woman's shoe strap in the field.
How or why she connects to them, I just don't know yet.
Well, you're not looking close enough.
Believe me, I've looked just about as close as I can bear.
I'm with you on the aliens thing.
They're here and they swapped out my father with José Eber.
I think your dad might be right.
I think we should get Turk and Keiser in the same room and actually ask them some questions.
Fine.
Let's do it.
The rule is, all slacks, all the time, no exceptions.
I hear that.
I've reached my naked man quota for the year.
Hello?
We'll be there.
Step inside, guys.
Your case just became legitimate.
Consider yourself hired.
I need answers and I need them quick.
Well, I do have something, Chief.
I'm getting a I'm getting skin pigment.
Bronzed, glistening Adonis-like skin pigment.
You lead me through this field, you let me ask one question, I guarantee it's going to come down to spray tanning.
Well, this guy's never seen the inside of a tanning salon.
I don't think he ever saw the sun.
You've got 24 hours.
Call me with something.
Grab a CSl.
Verify time of death.
Looks like we might have to open a kennel for all these copycats.
Well, we're back to square one.
I don't know, Shawn.
Maybe square one is the answer.
Maybe this is something beyond our comprehension.
Something otherworldly.
I hear what you're saying.
Do me a favor.
What?
Let go of the alien angle.
We need something solid, Gus.
Something Something concrete.
You heard the Chief.
Dude, how do you feel about leprechauns?
Oh, hello, me buckos.
I'm Marvin.
Welcome to Shenanigans, home of the world-famous Blarney Stone fajitas.
Hello, Marvin.
We're here to speak with a leprechaun.
Ha, ha, very funny.
Please stop.
My tummy's aching from laughing so hard.
You guys want a table or what?
Dude, give me some props.
He's got a hat with a buckle on it, everything's green.
What?
He's not a leprechaun.
Will you do me a favor?
In your funny accent, will you say, "magically delicious"?
Is that the world-famous clover stamp?
That's the one.
Will you stamp my buddy's wrist?
Whatever floats your boat, man.
It's for our nighttime events there.
But, hey, you can have it in the daytime, too.
What nighttime events?
We have speed dating here.
Speed dating?
Yeah.
Don't laugh.
It's actually one of our most popular events.
Guys come in here, and they sign up, they put down a hundred bucks and they get fixed up with all sorts of people on little six minute mini-dates.
Did you say a hundred bucks?
Hundred bucks.
How about fifty bucks for three minute dates?
Twenty five bucks for a minute and a half.
I float you a ten spot, you introduce us to somebody for 15 seconds.
How about you guys either get a table or I'm going to have to ask you to leave the podium?
How about "magically delicious"?
Will you say "magically delicious"?
No, but I can say police if you don't get your butts out of here.
Hello, there.
I'm Marvin.
Welcome to Shenanigans, home of the world famous Blarney Stone fajitas.
Yeah, I tried the speed dating thing a couple of times.
I just didn't think it had anything to do with the case and I was a little embarrassed about it.
Wow.
You paid a hundred bucks?
Mr. Turk, we feel it has everything to do with the case, all right?
Both Phil Keiser and the guy who turned up dead attended these speed dating events.
Do you remember anything strange happening there?
Or meeting anyone odd?
The only odd thing was that the ladies didn't take to me like they usually do.
That's beyond odd.
I can't imagine why, Fred.
Here's the thing, though.
Other strange things have been happening to me ever since I was at the event.
Like what?
Well, I applied for a job recently.
I was the perfect candidate.
I had several interviews and then suddenly after the final one, I was rejected.
Let me ask you a question, Freddy, and please be honest.
Were you on time for these interviews?
Yes, why do you ask?
I have no reason.
I think there's a woman involved here, who had it out for these guys.
We need to get a firsthand look at this speed dating phenomenon.
Not for a hundred bucks, we don't.
Gus, please, leave it to me.
Let me get this straight.
There is a dead body and a murderer loose in our city and you want the Santa Barbara Police Department to pay for you to go on dates?
Yes, that's correct.
I mean, I suppose we could split it if we had to.
What's that called?
Going Going Dutch?
Go Dutch.
I am not paying for your dating services, Mr. Spencer.
Look, here's the catch, Chief.
I'm going to be reading these people, psychically.
And I don't need six minutes.
Give me 40 seconds with these people.
I'll be able to tell you if they had anything to do with the murder.
And you know what?
Gus and I, we really did try to negotiate some sort of partial usage rate, but we got shut down by that leprechaun.
Mr. Spencer, enough.
Wait, I'm getting something else.
It's a woman in sexy high heeled strappy shoes.
She's roughly 5'2".
Jules, may I please have a pen and something to write on?
"To Lassy, "on the Alpine highway of life, "you're my all-weather tires.
"H and K's, Shawn.
" What the hell is this?
H and K's stands for hugs and kisses.
Not that part.
This part.
It's a tire pattern.
Run it through the system and we'll know what kind of car she drives.
Okay.
I'll give you a shot at this, but you're not going alone.
O'Hara, I want you to go along with these guys undercover working things from the other side.
See if you can sift any information from these women.
Will do.
Chief, I think that's the best idea you've ever had.
Shawn, I am so glad you're on board.
Detective Lassiter, I'm going to need you, too.
We don't know what this woman's type is, and, besides, you're now leading the case.
Yeah, you know, Chief, with all due respect, I'm really pretty busy working this case from another angle.
I mean, I ran the toxicology reports and I found that all three victims tested positive for trace amounts of the street drug GHB.
But our dead guy had a pre-existing heart condition.
So there was a pattern.
I think the murder was accidental.
And I like that track.
Now, follow it up by going to the speed dating thing.
It's just a date, Lassiter.
You do know how to conduct yourself on a date, don't you?
Okay, I checked out your tread pattern.
Thank you.
It's a high performance tire manufactured after 2002.
So we're looking for a woman who drives a late model sports car, probably American-made.
And 5'2" and likes strappy heels.
Check.
Question.
Is that what you're wearing?
What's wrong with what I'm wearing?
I always wear this.
Exactly.
Lassy, you look like a cop.
Now come on, man.
Is that your holster?
Of course it is.
You're here to speed date, man, not shoot somebody.
You got to loosen up.
Come on, take off the tie.
I'm not taking fashion tips from you.
You need to show some chest hair.
Chicks dig the sternum bush.
Jules, back me up on the stern bush.
I'm going to go see what these women have to say before this thing starts.
Bye, Jules.
All right, come on.
Let's go, Simon Cowell.
You got the salt and pepper, man.
It's nice.
I'm not taking off my tie just 'cause you tell me to.
Fine.
Suit yourself.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming.
For those ofyou who are new, I will explain how this works.
Okay?
You will pick a numbered table to begin your first date.
Every six minutes, you will hear That will indicate the end of your time together.
And your next date will begin.
Now, I know, six minutes is not a long time to get to know someone.
That's why myself and the other staff will use the questionnaires you filled out to match you up.
Okay?
Love is in the air.
I can smell it.
I smell cabbage.
Let the dating begin.
Shawn, that's a nice name.
Yeah, it's okay.
It's okay.
My last name is Hofen-Inderheine.
Yeah, it's been a tough life.
Wow.
Kids can be cruel.
Yeah.
You know you could probably change that.
What's your mom's maiden name?
Buzzteets.
Wow, yeah.
Teets, as in Yeah.
Yeah.
All my ancestry, we're farmers.
Oh, hey, I was raised on a farm.
No kidding.
I had this most adorable little pet goat named Cassie.
Goat?
Yeah.
Did you ever have any, you know, pets growing up?
What were their names?
Oh, what's your favorite color?
Move along.
I think these people might have more luck dating if they'd ask more interesting questions.
I just hope, I don't get pile driven.
Carlton, I hope this isn't too forward of me, but you have kind eyes.
Thank you.
This is uncanny.
I know.
God, you know, I never meet anyone I connect with at these things.
That's why I didn't even bother dressing up.
I mean I've given up a little.
I think you look great.
Thank you.
So, what kind of car do you drive?
Excuse me?
You drive a sports car?
Mustang, maybe?
2003?
That's kind of a shallow question, isn't it?
Do you like hanging out in fields?
Okay, you know what, I think this date's over.
No, I've got three minutes left.
Where were you on the night of the 18th?
You know, normally, I would wear a dress.
And heels?
Yeah, I guess, maybe.
Like open-toed strappy ones?
What?
Huh?
Huh?
Is that what you have in your closet?
A lot of high-heeled shoes?
Do you have a foot fetish?
No.
Look at us.
A couple kids on a proper date, huh?
You got some goosebumps?
Shawn, this isn't a date.
It's work.
You're absolutely right.
But, hey, you still got six minutes to ask me anything you want.
So, what do you want to know?
What are you dying to know about Shawn Spencer, the man?
The man.
Oddly enough, I don't think I have anything I'm dying to know.
Okay, Jules, don't lie, because lying is unbecoming.
I'll go first.
You, me, Burgess Meredith, Hume Cronyn, Nipsey Russell, deserted island, who are you going to sleep with?
Wait, so it's you or a bunch of dead guys?
Fair.
I'll give you Scatman Crothers.
Dead.
Flip Wilson.
Also dead.
Donald Pleasence.
None of the above.
None of the above?
Jules, are you kidding me?
You got You're going to miss me, aren't you?
A little bit.
Have fun on your next date, but I want you to think about that, okay?
Like if that really happened.
Bye, Shawn.
Go on.
Tell her she looks pretty.
Yeah, no can do.
That's it, people.
You should have completed all your dates.
Please score your cards and check up front at the bar and we will also tell you who you matched from your questionnaires.
Okay?
I'm sorry.
Date's over.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just haven't been a high-heel guy since Single White Female.
I just Yeah.
Thank you.
Dude, I think that Darcy girl might be the one.
She's the right height, she drives an '04 Trans Am.
And she wears nothing but heels.
How did you find out about the heels?
And she works in pharmaceutical sales, just like you.
Now, would she have access to that GHB stuff?
Well, she certainly would have access to the drugs to synthesize her own.
That's sweet.
Dude, you got to ask her out.
What?
And go out with a possible murderer?
You must be out of your mind.
I'm not doing that.
Gus, I got to see her on a date.
I got to see her in action.
I got to look, I got to listen, I got to feel.
Shawn, if we think it's her, let's tell Lassiter and Juliet and get them to bring her in.
You see what happens when we blurt out our theories.
We totally whiffed on the tanning salon.
All right, fine.
You go out with her then.
I would, but she matched up with you.
Oh, give her the sweetness.
Dude, you got to give her the sweetness.
This is a speed dating first.
You and you are a 100% match from your personality questionnaires.
I smell love.
Come on.
Come on.
I need a drink.
I got to pee.
Look, I don't know what to say to her.
I ran out of topics on the way over here.
Plus, she keeps wanting to rub my head.
What's up with that?
Gus, everybody wants to rub your head.
Look, you're doing fine, okay?
Here, here.
Here's a list of conversation topics, basic starters.
You got your ball, head on over there.
I'm right behind you.
"You're stranded on a deserted island and you have to procreate the species.
" Really?
This is gold.
I give you gold.
Yes!
That was good.
Shawn?
Detective O'Hara.
Shawn, what are you doing here?
Bowling, at a high level.
By yourself, on a Saturday night?
I'm in a league.
It's semi-pro.
I could have gone pro, but you know what, I made a choice.
I like to get 14-15 hours of practice in a week.
Wow.
I had no idea you were so serious about bowling.
Quite serious.
Quite serious.
Matter of fact, Lego wants to sponsor me this year.
Oh, my God.
That's great.
They also want me to wear shoes made out of Legos.
So, I'm torn.
Okay.
Well, I don't want to interrupt your practicing.
Yeah, yeah, I should get back.
I'm really not here to mess around.
Oh, my God, I am so rude.
Kyle, Shawn.
Shawn, Kyle.
No, that's my bowling hand.
There you go.
Shawn works for the police department.
He's a psychic.
Oh, cool, a psychic.
Nice.
Can you tell me anything about my future?
Oh, Kyle, please.
That's not really how it works.
Though I am I am getting something.
It's It's hazy, but I'm sensing that you're going to face a lot of rejection.
Work-wise?
No.
No.
Not work-wise.
Not work-wise.
You know what?
I'm going to go.
You kids get back to doing your thing.
You know, she bowl, then you bowl, then she bowl and you bowl.
And you've got the tight tuck and it's sweet and it's perfect.
See you, Jules.
Okay, okay.
Hold on a second.
I'll be right back.
Okay?
Okay.
Where the hell you been?
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.
I ran into somebody.
How you doing?
You okay?
Too okay.
She wants to go back to my place.
Oh, this is great.
We'll get all the information we need.
No.
The problem is I told her I live at the beach.
Why would you tell her that?
I don't know.
I was trying to impress her at the time.
I didn't realize I was going to be dating her, Shawn.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Let me think.
Dude, I got it.
You can take her to my dad's place.
This is perfect.
Look, just give me a head start.
I'll prep.
I'll cover everything.
Just drive slow, okay?
We can do this.
All right, bye.
Shawn Just listen, Dad.
Just listen.
Just hear me out.
Hear me out.
Listen.
This might actually be fun for us.
What, you expect me to stand outside of my own house, in the cold, getting bitten by bugs so Gus can score with some girl?
I don't think so.
Okay.
First of all, not just some girl, okay?
This dame is a looker.
She's a peach.
She's a spicy tomato.
And she may or may not be a murderer.
Oh, she Right, see, I knew it.
I knew it.
This has nothing to do with Gus finding a girl.
This is about you using my house so you can conduct a sting operation.
Shawn, it ain't going to happen.
Okay, what are you doing?
You're putting a negative spin on things, as usual.
Look, might they have a few more obstacles than your typical couple if she turns out to be a cold-blooded killer?
Sure.
But what if they really fall in love, Dad?
Shawn, you've got about three seconds to get out of my way.
One That's cheating.
You're cheating.
No, no, Dad.
Quiet.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Please, come in.
Oh!
Oh.
You lit a fire.
That was fast.
Have a seat.
Welcome to my home.
Wow.
You really like fishing.
No.
God, no.
I'm just playing.
Yes, actually, I do love fishing.
Yes.
Love it.
Love me some fishing.
Some wide mouth bass, some perch, some sturgeon.
Sturgeon is a fish, right?
Okay.
Okay.
What is that?
What?
That smell.
It's like It's like gardenia with a hint of mango.
What?
Oh, my God.
Did you take a bath?
Yes, Shawn.
I took a bath.
Yes, you know, like security safes, vaults with locking devices.
Do you crack safes?
With bubbles?
Are you my little safecracker?
Well, I haven't actually cracked any safes.
It's this new soap that I'm using.
It foams more.
It foams more?
Dad, it's called bubble bath.
Well, I don't think it's officially called bubble bath if the bubbles happen accidentally, but whatever, Shawn.
Who are you?
Where's my father?
I've accused you of being a lot of things in my lifetime, but metrosexual was never one of them.
I am not a metrosexual.
I just happen to be an average Joe who is concerned about his health and appearance.
I have taken baths for years, Shawn.
That is where I think.
I have solved dozens and dozens of gruesome, gruesome murder cases sitting in a tub.
FYl, historically, real men have always taken baths.
Name one.
John Wayne.
Rio Bravo.
Bath.
You got anybody since the Old West?
What's that?
That's my roast.
It's done.
You made a roast?
For Christ's sake, Shawn.
It's not a quiche.
It's man food.
I would have gladly gone out and hunted it and killed it if I had the time.
And unless you get out of my way, I am going to kill you.
No, you can't go in there.
You go in there, you're going to compromise this entire investigation.
What is being compromised is my pot roast.
It is drying out as we speak.
Please.
No, Dad.
No.
God.
Please, kids, pay no mind.
Just passing through to the kitchen.
Got to squeeze some juices on my roast.
Gus?
Oh, that's Henry.
He's my roommate.
Yeah, he's just making a roast.
All done.
All done.
Just had to Okay.
Look, it's fine that you have a roommate, but Honestly, it's cramping our style.
It is?
What do you say we go somewhere more private?
Private like where?
I know a back road that leads to a field.
We can park the car.
Yeah.
I don't think we should go to the field.
Why?
Why?
You don't like me.
That's it, isn't it?
No, no, my hay fever.
My hay fever.
The last place my nasal passages want to be is a field.
No, no, no, she's not your killer, Shawn.
Look in this girl's eyes, son.
They're sincere.
You don't think I'm pretty.
What?
You You just felt bad because you We matched up at the speed dating and you didn't know what to say, so you pretended.
Wow.
You put all that together, huh?
Those are real tears, Shawn.
You're right.
That's real snot.
Hello.
Lassy?
You what?
Okay, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, I got to go.
What do you mean you got to go?
You got this covered.
This poor girl is there weeping on your best friend's shoulder in my house and you're leaving?
What do you do?
What am I supposed to do?
I know.
I know.
It's a tough one.
It's a real thinker.
I got it.
Draw yourself another bath.
Shawn.
Shawn.
Picked him up a couple of hours ago.
Found him loitering outside one of the speed dater's homes.
When Lassiter checked his place, he found a stack of the questionnaires in his apartment.
Tell me about these, Marvin.
Look, I don't know anything about any crime.
I just I used the names and the numbers to get dates, man.
That's it.
I don't have a hundred bucks to slap down on some entrance fee.
Not on my crap salary.
So, yeah.
And besides, that's why they go there.
They go there for dates, right?
So why not me?
Why don't you think about that while you're trying to take a crap in front of six other guys?
Look, okay, come on, all right?
All I did was I took some questionnaires out of the trash.
That's it.
What's the charge?
Not littering?
So if you don't have anything more, I'd like to get to work.
You think he's telling the truth?
Not by a long shot.
Now, look at him, he's not the right height, he doesn't even own a car.
I mean he can't match the tire tread.
He's cocky.
He thinks he's on a roll, but I'm inside his head, Chief.
And I'm about to hang a Lopez around the frontal lobe and shoot right out of his nose onto his vest.
You smell where I'm stepping?
He had a partner.
You let him go back to work, he's going to lead us right to the person.
And I'll be able to pick them out psychically.
You have my word.
I better.
Lassiter, let him go.
Excuse me?
Release him.
Release him?
Why am I going to release him?
Why would I release him?
Release him.
What?
Why don't you get your shillelagh and get out of here?
You got it.
Excuse me, may I help you people?
Yeah.
We're here for the speed dating event.
Oh, I'm sorry, it's already begun.
Oh, wait.
I remember you.
Look, you seem like a decent fellow and I'd hate for you to waste another $100.
But I was watching you and you're not very good at this.
Police business.
Scat.
Okay, I need to breathe and I need some space to do my thing.
Okay.
Shawn.
Oh, good, buddy, you got the message.
It's not Darcy.
You're in the clear.
You're going to pay, Shawn.
You are going to pay.
Believe me.
No offense, but it's tough to feel threatened by you when you're wearing that shirt.
Is that a hibiscus?
It's not my shirt, Shawn.
It's your dad's shirt.
He had to loan me one because mine was covered in snot tears.
I can't Did you know he also takes bubble baths?
So did John Wayne.
I know, but can you name one other guy?
What's going on?
I solved the case.
It's actually got a decent twist.
Have a seat.
Well, I'm actually kind of an adventurist.
You know, I was caught in an avalanche once and in order to survive, I drank my own urine and I ate three of my toes, which is, you know, maybe why you saw me limp when I came in.
Hey, big guy, you mind if I You mind if I cut in here?
Oh, I don't know.
We're kind of in a You're going to be okay.
Okay, all right.
I really hope it wasn't rude.
It seemed a little rude.
Well, actually, I should thank you because he was awful.
That is a very nice name.
But you're kind of cute.
So, navy blue's your favorite color?
Mine's green.
You know you seem European.
You're sure you don't have family history there?
What's your mother's maiden name?
So, after volunteering for the animal shelter, I decided Can I just Can I stop you for a moment?
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Everybody, I'm sorry, if I could just get your attention for a sec here.
I'm sorry.
I want to pick this up right where we left off if there's any time left on the clock, okay?
Because you seem like a terrific person.
You deserve someone special.
Someone who makes you feel safe, but also a little dirty, you know what I'm talking about?
Everyone deserves someone special, each and every one of you.
All of you.
Look, is your perfect match here tonight?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
But the point is, you're here and you put your hearts on the line and that's all that really matters.
Unfortunately, there are two people here that do not share your pure desires.
They're not here to find their soul mates.
They're not here to fall in love.
As a matter of fact, they're not even single.
You, Glenda and you, Marvin, are a couple.
An odd couple, to be sure.
But a couple.
Matter of fact, you're married.
That is absurd.
The tan lines on your fingers where your wedding rings used to be will prove Please, not with the tanning thing again.
that not only are you married, but that tanning had something to do with this investigation.
Thank you, Chief.
Now the question is, why would a married couple infiltrate a singles event?
Well, the answer is simple.
It's a perfect place to commit their crime.
They're here to rob you, ladies and gentlemen.
To steal from you the one thing that is invariably your own.
Identity.
I told you that leprechaun was bad.
Marvin did copy the questionnaires to get these people's phone numbers and addresses.
And you, Glenda, cleverly found the answers to questions like, "What's your mother's maiden name"?
"What's your favorite color"?
"Did you have any pets"?
"What are their names"?
"Name all the Bee Gees.
" Those are the same questions that you get at the bank from security when you try to authorize a credit card.
So what was left?
Get the credits card numbers from these poor guys without them knowing they were robbed.
So you came up with a plan.
You followed them, you drugged them.
You took down the numbers and you deposited them naked in a field where they woke up disoriented, grassy-assed, but none the wiser.
Fred Turk did see a little alien that day.
Except it wasn't an extraterrestrial.
It was Marvin in his ridiculous, stupid green leprechaun costume.
And they would have gotten away with it, too, folks, if it wasn't for their last victim.
The one who didn't quite wake up.
Not so fast!
Because that isn't even the worst of it.
The worst of it is that you two stole a very valuable seat that belonged to a single person.
A single person who believes in the power of love.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Both of you.
Murder, wow.
That's a speed dating first.
Be sure to check up at the bar and see who you match from your questionnaires.
Okay?
I'm sorry about that.
Wow.
You know, I just It was from here, though.
You know that.
So, we were talking about what?
We were talking about Beagles.
Beagles, that's so sweet.
Because you like them and you put little sweaters on them.
Yeah, well, sometimes.
Excuse me, sorry.
May I cut in?
It's my parole officer.
Oh.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Sure.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Where did you I thought you I thought you were on a date.
I was.
It's over.
Over?
Mmm-hmm.
Over, like he laid one on you on the front porch and you got little butterflies, over?
Or you You pretended like you had a headache and you called it quits early, over?
Not that it's any of your business, but he can't bowl.
And that's a deal-breaker.
I see.
Hmm.
But, look, the only reason I sat down is because I wanted to clear one thing up.
I don't take any stock in those profile matching thingies we did the other night.
Jules, I was just messing around.
I I copied your card over your shoulder.
Like verbatim.
What, you thought maybe I sew my own pajamas?
That's Right, okay.
Well, good, because I don't want there to be any weirdness between us and it seems like we're going to be working together a lot.
All the time.
Yeah.
So, nice job on the case, by the way.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Okay, all right, I'll see you at work.
That's how we do it, work style.
Yeah.
See you at work.
See you.
Where's she going?
You know what, I think I undersold the fajitas.
Well, it wouldn't be the first time a female walked out on you in the middle of a meal.
Oh, please, Gus, we're talking about Jules here.
It's not like we were on a date.
Plus it wouldn't work out.
It would never work out.
I'd have to really bowl well.
And apparently that's a deal-breaker.
You know how awful those are?
I'm hungry, man.
We don't have to stay.
Dude.
Jerk chicken.
Oh, you know, that's right.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Dad, why do those people get better seats than us?
Your Honor, it's not that I Shawn, those people aren't just watching the trial.
Those people are the trial.
They're the jurors, and they're the most important people in this room.
They are?
The thing about the jury is, Shawn, you gotta learn how to look at them, how to read them.
For instance, take a look at juror number five.
He's the guy in the front row, second one from the left.
Tell me what you see.
Go.
Brown shirt, little hole in his collar.
His coat is too tight on him.
He's got rough hands, he's looking down mostly and nodding a lot.
Good, good.
All right, let's take that hole in his collar.
Now, would Mom ever let you leave the house looking like that?
Never.
You believe it.
So, that tells us that he's probably not married.
That's called deductive reasoning.
Your Honor, the people call Detective Henry L. Spencer to the stand.
All right, watch closely, kid.
One day you're gonna walk up the steps of this courthouse and you're gonna make your old man proud.
Gus, they impounded my motorcycle without warning.
I'm pretty sure the warning was the $900 worth of parking tickets you racked up.
Still, man, you can't take a man's means of transportation away.
It's, like, unconstitutional or something.
I'm pretty sure it's not in the Constitution.
Oh, don't be so sure.
I think it says, "Thou shalt not something, or covet something.
"Don't mess with Texas or the right of transportation.
" You're thinking of a commandment.
That's even better.
Can we just pay this ticket so we can get out of here, please?
You gotta be kidding me.
We came all the way over here, and now you're not gonna wait in the line?
Gus, did you see it in there?
It's a ticket payment line, not Space Mountain.
Hardly worth it.
Plus, I don't wait in lines.
What do you mean you don't wait in lines?
Everyone waits in lines.
That's what we do as people, we wait in lines.
I don't.
It's not in my nature.
That makes no sense, Shawn.
You remember the story of the scorpion and the frog?
Burton Guster.
They're both on the riverbank.
The scorpion's like, "Hey" The point is I shouldn't have gotten any tickets, Gus.
I was using my ambassador plates.
Ambassador plates?
You're not an ambassador, Shawn.
Impersonating a government official will land you in jail.
I am an ambassador, of sorts.
I am a goodwill ambassador to Paraguay.
To where?
Paraguay.
It is an honorary title that I received after overseeing all sand castle construction at a South American Club Med.
You never worked at Club Med.
Ooh, turn that up.
Someone we know, someone we love, someone we invited into our I just saw that woman at the courthouse.
That's Sandra Panitch, the fourth grade teacher who murdered Jackson Hale.
Don't you watch the news?
I can't watch Channel 8 anymore.
Lloyd Lansing wears a toupee.
It's like every newscast starts with a lie.
I can't stand this guy.
Something about him just irks me.
Listen to him.
Sandra Panitch went with weatherman Jackson Hale to his Channel 8 news studio, engaged in sexual relations with him, and then stabbed him in the heart with a letter opener.
She fled the scene, but not without leaving behind a mountain of physical evidence, including a trail of the victim's blood, and her fingerprints all over the murder weapon.
This is why the state is going after murder one.
But she didn't do it!
What?
Gus, I'm getting a very strong feeling here.
I think that woman is innocent.
I do watch the news, and I've been following this case.
They have a mountain of evidence against this lady.
Look, they call her the "School Marm Murderer.
" Okay, first of all, there's a question mark at the end of that.
They call her the "School Marm Murderer"?
Even the news people aren't convinced.
And today at the courthouse, in the middle of a conversation, I saw her bend over and pick up a piece of trash!
Oh, I see.
So because she picks up somebody's KitKat wrapper means she didn't kill anybody?
That makes sense.
Gus, she didn't have to do that.
The woman is about to be on trial for her life.
She takes time out for common courtesy?
That is not the mindset of a cold-blooded murderer.
No!
This is what I know.
She looked at me right in the eyes.
Now, there are a lot of tells that people have when they are trying to appear not guilty.
The way that they sit, crossing their legs, uncrossing them, crossing them back, eye lines to inanimate objects, twitching, itching, rubbing.
All of these affectations, I am an expert on all of them.
But there is one thing that you cannot change no matter how hard you try, and that is the tent on the windows to the soul.
Adam Hornstock, attorney for the defense.
Sandra Panitch is a victim of circumstance, of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I know.
Look at this poor guy.
Look, he's hunched over, he's not making eye contact.
Look at the handkerchief in the left pocket, there.
It's not decorative, Gus.
That's crumpled and stained.
That's used for dabbing sweat, a lot.
Her lawyer's a beaten man.
Whether he knows it or not, Adam Hornstock needs us.
What are you talking about?
Dude, we're going to be legal consultants.
It's awesome.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Ooh, let's get in there and grab seats.
How?
You think that court officer is guarding the door for his health?
Just roll with me on this.
Excuse me, people.
Coming through!
Shawn Spencer here.
Spencer.
That's S-P-E-N-C-E-R.
This is my partner, Burton Guster.
G-U Look, I know I've been reluctant to go on record about this trial up to this point I'm sorry, who are you?
What is this, Journalism 101?
I give my statement, you berate me with your rudimentary Q and A later.
In fact, you two switch places.
Come here.
Excuse me.
Come on, don't be shy.
He puts his pants on one leg at a time.
I do.
As I was saying, this trial is not about a particular case.
It is about our rights as citizens.
No one, and I mean no one, should ever wake up and I don't know, let's say, find that their motorcycle has been taken away from them.
As this trial moves forward, I'll have more to say.
That is all.
Thank you.
Motorcycle?
Whose motorcycle are we talking about here?
Did Guys, please.
Please, give them space.
Please.
Are we ready yet, Mr. Hornstock?
Oh, yes.
Just one moment, sir.
Ah!
You know, I was pre-law once.
Maybe I should have stuck with it.
You were never pre-law.
Well, I was pre-pre-law.
Sixth grade, but it was an accelerated program.
I won a mock trial of Tortoise v. Hare, you know.
The hare did it.
Of course he did.
The court will take a short recess, and then perhaps, Mr. Hornstock, we can get going with these proceedings.
Dude, we're so hired.
We are?
Watch this.
Excuse me, Mr. Hornstock?
Right?
You don't know me.
My name's Shawn Spencer.
I'm the lead psychic detective at the SBPD.
Yeah, I'm a little busy right now.
I can see.
You're doing a bang up job.
Please don't stop.
I just I think maybe you should be a little careful.
Of?
Juror number four.
Juror Oh, yeah?
Why is that?
Something about you really bothers her.
And something about her bothers me.
I mean, she's been frowning at me the whole time, and I haven't even gone up yet.
Here's the thing.
She's a fashion maven.
She has a problem with your appearance, and until you change it, I don't think she's gonna listen to a word you say.
My appearance?
The manner in which you appear.
Your look.
I don't know exactly what the problem is, but let's check it out.
Why don't you give me the Give me the 360 cat dance real fast, huh?
Excuse me?
Just twirl it up for me, and then twirl it right back.
There it is.
And back.
Suit, pleated.
I would have gone with a three button, maybe something in a wool-cotton blend, but I don't think that's the problem.
Sideburns?
Check.
Hair, bold, Strokes, Hives.
I don't think that's the problem.
The shoes, not a spit shine, but like you said, you haven't gotten up yet, so I can't make heads or Whoa!
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I think it's the tie.
What?
My tie?
What's wrong with my tie?
Well, it's a little bit Well, look, it's not like my favorite tie I'm so glad to hear you say that.
Gus?
What?
Quick, give me your tie.
I'm not giving you my tie.
It's a good tie!
Give me your tie, please.
It's a Thomas Pink tie.
One second.
Why don't you give me the tie?
Just once will you Come on, Shawn!
Look high, reach low.
Got it.
Now, we're also going to take this.
Primarily because it's covered in sweat, but also because it reads cruise ship waiter to me.
Cruise ship?
Go get 'em!
And so, I will demonstrate to the court that Sandra Panitch is an upstanding citizen with no criminal record, and the district attorney has rushed to the prosecution of an innocent woman.
Are you finished now, Mr. Hornstock?
Hmm?
Ah!
Oh, yes.
Yes, Your Honor.
Brilliant.
Well, things are finally moving along.
Court will recess till after lunch.
Did you see that?
That was amazing!
Did you see that?
That was a whole 180!
Well, it's a pretty amazing tie.
Hey, strong shag, strong tie, strong person.
You know, guys, I would hire you in a second.
It's just Well, I, I don't have the authorization.
My firm doesn't really believe in Winning?
No.
Mermaids?
No.
The Minotaur?
No, me.
Yeah, at least not anymore.
No, there's no buts here.
A lot of the cases my partner Gus and I take, we do for free.
It's called pro bono.
Gus?
What?
A little decorum, we're in a courtroom.
Congratulations, you got yourself a couple of legal consultants.
Wow.
Oh, boy.
Did he just grab your fist?
And then he shook it.
Well, well, well, what do we have here?
Hi, Jules.
Please tell me you're not one of those courtroom groupies that bounces from trial to trial?
Wait a second, was that you at the Michael Jackson hearing with the sequined glove and the shirt that said, "Please free the man in the mirror"?
That's actually really funny, Shawn.
Detective Lassiter is the one who actually made the arrest of Sandra Panitch.
See, that makes it my case.
What a coincidence.
It's also our case.
Yeah, we just signed on as legal consultants to the defense just now.
And you will sell your little sideshow act to anyone who'll listen, won't you?
Just don't screw this one up.
"Don't screw this up"?
Hey, Lassy, that really wasn't much of a put down.
In fact it was somewhat inspiring.
Las, let's roll that back!
I don't know.
It feels a little weird.
I mean, you should really be sitting here.
This is your office.
Yeah, this isn't my office.
You didn't like mine.
This is Carter Jarecki's office, one of the partners.
Actually, he's the guy who took the case in the first place, but then dumped it on me when he decided it was a lost cause.
You see, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
Why didn't you stand up to that guy?
For the worst reason possible.
I actually believe this woman is innocent.
Now, can we please go before Jarecki gets back?
Carter Jarecki just left for a nooner with his mistress.
We have at least two hours.
Maybe an hour and a half.
Hornstock, I think you have the potential to be a fantastic lawyer.
You just need confidence.
After all, that's your name on the door.
Now come on!
Oh, no.
No.
None of those Hornstocks are me.
The first one is my grandfather, he founded the firm.
The other one is my father, then my brother.
Wow.
A whole family of lawyers?
Yeah, even my sister.
Well, there you go.
She didn't make the door.
She's Biederman.
It's her married name.
Well, we're gonna need to take a look at your witness list and your deposition transcripts.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I prepared all that for you.
I have Here are all the forensic and arrest reports.
And I deposed several of Hale's coworkers from Channel 8, mostly to refute timelines and for character testimony.
Can we see those?
Oh, sure, yeah.
It's Oh, yes.
And maybe, later on we can read the phonebook, just for fun.
Hornstock, I've gotta do what I do.
That's not the way I do it.
I need to see, feel and smell people in order to figure out what happens.
Smell them?
So, this is where the The crime took place.
So, just feel free to have a look around, and do whatever it is you do.
Okay.
Thank you.
Let's walk the crime, shall we?
Yeah.
He probably came in from that same entrance we did.
Right.
Found their way over here to the Channel 8 anchor desk area.
Of course, the body was found here.
It was a short walk.
Yeah.
Priscilla, what are these green walls for?
Oh, well we do it all on green screen.
Really?
Can you show me how that works, please?
Sure, I just need someone to sit in front.
Gus, go sit over there.
I'm not going to sit there just 'cause you tell me to, Shawn.
Fine, I'll I'll play anchorman.
I got it.
I got it.
Okay, so we've just have to go to the control room.
It's just this way.
Okay.
You know when we're watching the weather guy, and it looks like he's got, like, rainfall behind him?
Yeah.
Or snow or hail?
Yeah.
How does that work?
Well, the green background works as a blank slate.
Then I just run it through the board and presto!
A composite of the two images is made.
Oh, oh!
Can we get sound in here?
Yeah, yeah.
Sure.
In local news, a pharmaceutical representative again provided the key piece of information in a baffling police case.
But ran screaming from the scene, like a little girl before he could make a statement.
That was one time, Shawn!
One time!
I don't like dead bodies!
I told you that.
Now stop bringing that up!
Hello, this is your local news.
This next office was Jackson Hale's.
I've got to tell you guys, everybody's been acting a little weird since it happened.
It's just not the same.
Oh!
Ruben, this is Shawn Spencer and Burton Guster.
They're working on Jackson Hale's case.
This is Ruben Leonard, he's a lab meteorologist on Jackson's team.
Was.
I was just sorting and packing some of his more important things to send to his family.
It's the least I can do.
That's very thoughtful.
Thank you.
That reminds me of a hot, little seòorita I met there.
She was serving fried jalapenos Would you excuse me?
Sure.
Sure.
Thanks.
So, if you'll notice that Did you work with Jackson Hale long?
Six years.
He was a great man.
I had a lot of respect for him.
He was just so good at what he did.
Take your umbrella because I guarantee, it's raining cats and dogs out there.
A broadcasting treasure.
Anyway, take a look at Thursday here Dude, Ruben's in there destroying Hale's awards.
What?
Yeah.
Unless he's really offended by the shoddy engraving on the plaque, that guy hates Jackson Hale.
I'm not saying he did it, but reasonable doubt, anyone?
Okay, Miss Panitch.
Please, walk us through the night of the crime.
Well, I never met Mr. Hale before that night.
I just moved here from Wisconsin.
It wasn't like I was a fan of his.
I only vaguely knew he was a weatherman.
So we talked, and he was charming So the scratches on Jackson Hale's back and his skin under your the fingernails, this all happened during the sex, as well as the bruises on your arm?
It got passionate.
I don't remember anything until I woke up the next morning.
With his blood on you?
And then you fled to the parking lot?
Look, I was scared.
I, I know how bad all of this looks, I do.
But I swear I did not murder anyone.
Do you guys believe me?
Do you?
Of course we do, Sandra.
Don't be ridiculous.
Counselor?
Yes?
Would you please retire with me to the hallway, where we can exchange words in hushed tones?
Okay, what are you doing?
What?
You are supposed to be demonstrating confidence and swagger for Hornstock.
Instead you're poking holes in our case, and you're scaring our defendant.
Here are the facts, Shawn.
All we know about Sandra is what she's told us.
I think we need to do some investigating.
I believe her.
Hornstock believes her.
What else do we need?
We need proof, Shawn.
Look, right here in this book?
Corey v. Bulevic in 1955.
The key piece of evidence were half-melted candlesticks.
We need evidence!
Where are our candlesticks, Shawn?
Maybe you just jumped over them?
What?
Be nimble.
Be quick.
You're not going to give me anything for that?
Now can we please Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Check out the judge.
He's grabbing his back.
No wonder he's so grumpy.
He's not grabbing his back, he's grabbing his kidneys.
He probably has a kidney stone.
Dude, nice!
Thank you.
Please state to the court what your relationship with Mr. Hale was.
It was professional.
He was my boss.
I was his receptionist.
And as the Channel 8 receptionist, Miss Osterman, if people were to call Jackson Hale, you took those calls?
I did.
And did you receive any calls from the defendant, Sandra Panitch, at any time?
Oh, not to my knowledge.
No.
But other women would call?
Sure.
Was Jackson Hale sleeping with these women?
Objection, Your Honor, hearsay.
I'll allow the question.
Well, I can only say that I fielded many calls, and sometimes I helped to juggle these calls.
He was a handsome man.
He certainly was.
Thank you, Miss Osterman.
You may step down, Miss Osterman.
Thanks.
Your Honor, the state requests a moment to prepare for our next witness.
"He certainly was"?
What happened?
You were rolling!
I don't know, I don't know, it sounded good in my head.
You have a great support system, you know, it gives you that easy confidence.
But, you know, my father hasn't been in the courtroom once.
Not one of my trials.
You've been here one day, and your father's already here.
What are you talking about?
Oh, I met him outside.
He's a really nice guy.
Your Honor, the defense would like to call for a recess.
Excuse me.
Who are you?
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm a psychic legal consultant on this case.
Objection, Your Honor.
We were not made aware that a psychic was hired on this case.
Approach the bench, all of you.
Sweet.
Your Honor, the people question his validity.
Okay, first of all, that's hurtful.
Look, I know you're the big bad prosecutor with the sweet head, but is this tone really necessary?
No.
Look, I'm a legitimate consultant.
I've been hired often by the Santa Barbara Police Department, and there is a high-ranking detective in this very courtroom right now, who will vouch for my validity.
And who is this?
He's right there.
The wispy, yet commanding Irish fellow, who looks like he's been sucking on the Sour Patch Kids.
Will you stand and state your name for the court?
Carlton Lassiter, Santa Barbara Police Department, Your Honor.
Head detective, Perhaps you'd like to inform the court of your favorite color as well.
The point is, do you know this man?
I do.
And has he worked on cases for the department?
He has.
There you have it.
There you have it.
And he was helpful?
Absolutely.
Did he just say absolutely with a little half smile?
I'd like that printed out, please.
I'm thinking of shellacking it on a nice piece of maple, maybe a little decoupage.
Your Honor, as you can see, I'm responsible for breaking many cases here in the state of California.
Well, guess what?
I don't care who you are, or what you've done for the state.
I don't believe in that psychic mumbo-jumbo and it's not welcome in my court!
"Mumbo-jumbo"?
Oh!
You poor, poor man.
No wonder.
You're Passing a kidney stone can be very stressful.
Who told you that?
I never told anyone.
You tell me if I'm overstepping my bounds here, but I'd like to suggest an old home remedy that did wonders for my Aunt Dolores.
She simply gargled with some mineral water, followed it up with some raw greens.
Me, personally, I'd go with asparagus tips, that way, later on, when you're making water, you'll know that it's working.
Let's proceed with the trial.
Okay, you got me?
I'm startled.
What are you doing here?
Well, maybe we're both psychics.
I am serious.
Occasionally, I come down here, I sit in on a trial.
Today, I get a phone call.
Guess who's practicing law now?
Wait a minute.
You come down here regularly?
Thursdays, usually.
Today was just a bonus.
My God, you just can't let go, can you?
You retired too early.
Not my fault.
I didn't ask you to turn in your badge, Dad.
Shawn!
Shawn!
Shawn!
I'm in there trying to do something You seem to forget whose name you've got at the end of your letterhead, kid.
When you use my name, it is my business as well.
Give me my phone.
Took you long enough to figure out the kidney stone.
Let it be noted that the witness identified the defendant, Sandra Panitch, as the woman he saw running through the parking lot on the night of the murder.
Has it been authenticated?
Hey, what would Phelps need to get authenticated?
I don't know.
His little collection of green army men?
H- Stock, did you just make a joke?
Hmm?
I think you did.
Your witness.
Does the defense wish to cross-examine?
Your Honor, the defense rests.
No.
No, it doesn't.
Your Honor, the defense may rest.
Why am I not resting?
I have a vibe that's very strong.
Hatred, jealousy.
That guy wanted to be a serious weatherman.
He has no sympathy for Jackson Hale whatsoever.
Wait.
What?
You think he did it?
No, I'm pretty sure he didn't.
But we can plant a seed.
Johnny Applestock.
Your Honor, the defense does not rest.
Mr. Leonard, you are a meteorologist, are you not?
Yes, I am indeed.
But not on the air?
No, not on the air.
Hmm.
Maybe because you don't have a meteorologist name.
I don't follow.
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but Leonard isn't a term for any kind of weather?
No, it is not.
So, if I was to look up Leonard, in say, a weather glossary, there would be no definition?
No, there would not.
Excuse me, where is this going?
Yes, Mr. Hornstock, where are you going with this?
I'm sorry, Your Honor, it's just that every successful weatherman that I know of, has a real weatherman's name.
Johnny Mountain, Dallas Rains?
Oh, Jackson Hale, for example.
Hey, first of all that wasn't even his real name.
Precisely.
Have you ever considered going by the name of Bolt Lightning?
No.
Cloudy McMillen?
No.
Wendy Morning Dew?
That's a woman's name.
Okay, look, I have a degree in meteorology from the University ofVirginia.
I wrote my thesis on Bernoulli's theorem of incompressible level flow, and I was a junior tornado safety captain for seven years.
Jackson Hale has a degree in what?
Physical education from a junior college.
He was an embarrassment.
He was worthless, all right?
He was worthless to anyone who was a real meteorologist like myself.
He should have been stabbed in the heart long ago!
Objection, Your Honor.
It's a little late for that, don't you think, Counselor?
That's the kind of confidence I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
We are on our way to winning this thing.
Told you.
She's kind and she's innocent.
Just because we had a small victory in court yesterday doesn't mean we're out of the woods.
Son of a bitch!
Alligator pumps!
I swear, I should arrest that weatherman.
He clearly stated it was not going to rain today.
You see, that's the problem with what I like to call "group thinking.
" We don't listen to group thinkers.
Nope.
In fact, we don't listen to weathermen at all.
If you excuse me, I've really got better things to do.
Dinner with your cat?
O'Hara, are you coming?
You go.
I'll catch up with you in a sec.
You know, Shawn, for a psychic, you are missing something right in front of your face.
It's too bad.
You might actually learn something about Lassiter.
Maybe you don't want to.
He waxes his back?
I'm gonna go now.
Shawn, I don't care what anyone else says.
The pink shirt is working.
Okay, that was cryptic.
Not really.
I'll be damned.
Who's Detective Assi?
Lassy.
It's Lassiter.
He must have sent some sort of memo to Phelps.
The question is why would Lassiter send a letter to the D.A.'s office?
Don't you ever watch Law and Order?
They tend to work together sometimes.
Right.
So So, go ahead and check the files, and find me that letter.
Phelps received it on the seventh.
I've been through all of them.
There are no memos submitted into evidence, filed on the seventh.
So, it didn't get filed.
But there is a memo.
So whatever's on that memo is clearly worth hiding.
And she told you this directly?
Yes, when I questioned the defendant, she admitted to having sexual relations with the victim.
But not to stabbing him with a letter opener?
Well, she appeared at the time to be confused and had memory gaps.
She claimed never to have seen or touched the weapon.
Even though her fingerprints were all over it.
I see.
Thank you, Detective Lassiter.
Nothing further.
Your witness.
You sure about this?
Yes, I have a very strong feeling about this letter.
First rule of trial law, never ask a question you don't know the answer to.
Hey, have I steered you wrong yet?
Come on.
Detective Lassiter, did you send a letter to the D.A.'s office on the seventh of August?
Yes, I did.
And what did it say?
I Objection, lack of foundation.
I'll allow it.
Go ahead, tell the jury what it said.
It questioned the defendant's motive.
That it was very strong, you mean?
No, it questioned whether I believed the defendant had one at all.
The prosecution never submitted this letter into evidence.
So, at this point, Your Honor, the defense calls for a mistrial.
Man, this is fun!
Approach the bench.
We may have received the letter.
I I can't be sure.
We didn't knowingly withhold it.
My office is wall to wall papers.
Then go to Staples and buy yourself some new file folders, but until then, you are warned.
Any new evidence must be submitted to all parties immediately.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Your Honor.
And in the spirit of that ruling, I would like to submit a new piece of evidence.
If this is that willy-nilly piece of evidence that you tried to get in, in pre-trial, I'll tell you one more time.
I will not admit any audio-visual evidence unless it's been authenticated.
We're talking about playing it to him.
It's a videotape.
Hmm?
We just got our authentication papers from the lab in Sacramento.
It is a videotape of the defendant, Sandra Panitch, murdering the victim, Jackson Hale.
Judge, I argue that this tape should not be admissible.
On what grounds?
Well, we're citing unfair surprisery.
I I still don't understand why he is in this room.
He's nothing but a disruption.
Maybe someday, Phelps, when you're a judge, which I highly doubt will happen, then you can decide who's welcome in your chambers.
Your Honor, these guys are a part of my team, and I want them here.
Why?
You used to be a good lawyer, Hornstock.
But let's face it, if you've gotta resort to hiring this idiot psychic and his little sidekick I'm nobody's sidekick, you Whoa!
Gus, Gus.
Come on.
Forget you.
Gus, we are all grown men here.
Let's just take a beat.
Let's Let's take a step back.
Let's take a step back.
Mr. Hornstock, having now seen the video in question, I don't think I need to tell you how damaging it is.
I strongly suggest at this point that you consider accepting a plea bargain for murder two.
Your Honor, I will have to review the tape and confer with my client.
I tell you what, Hornstock.
I will leave murder two on the table until tomorrow morning.
Consider that my gift to you.
She doesn't realize she's being taped.
No, I don't think this is his first barbeque either, if you know what I mean.
This high-def plasma really makes a difference.
I see the beads of sweat on his neck.
Look at his hair!
That's horrible!
Yeah.
Oh, wow!
Do any of you make noises like that?
His or hers?
When she sees this, she will certainly take the deal.
I'm not going to take the deal.
If you don't take the deal, you could go away possibly for life.
You do realize this?
I don't care.
I'm not gonna admit to something that I didn't do!
Okay, I believe you.
I believe you.
But I watched that tape.
And as your attorney, I am begging you, take the deal.
Don't take the deal.
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be on my side.
Hornstock, I am on your side.
I mean, not technically, because of the shape of this table.
Imagine a round table.
I would have sat somewhere in the middle.
Okay, tomorrow morning when the jury watches this tape, we will lose this case.
This tape is not telling us the whole truth.
There's more.
I need to take this tape.
You just work on your closing arguments.
You leave the rest to me.
Quit pacing, Shawn.
You're making me nervous.
I can't afford it, Dad.
I can't afford a guilty verdict on my record right now.
I can't!
You do realize that you're not a real lawyer?
Right?
You don't have a record.
It's so weird.
The prosecution keeps treating this case like a crime of passion, right?
But she only knew him for a couple of hours.
I ask you, how much passion can you muster up for someone in a couple of hours?
Yeah, well, crimes of passion are rarely about love or sex, Shawn.
They're closer to revenge, sometimes hatred.
I would say that your angry meteorologist is the best suspect you got going.
He didn't do it.
Yeah, I know that, Shawn.
The point is you need to find somebody who felt like that.
Oh, Dad, believe me, there are plenty.
The guy slept with half of Santa Barbara.
We put them all on the stand.
The problem is that Sandra is the only one who was there.
You have a whisk.
I do.
And you're not looking close enough.
Well, you know what?
It's tough, when virtually everything imaginable is stacked against me.
I've got your ass staring me down in the courtroom.
I've got a defense attorney who breaks every time the wind blows, I've got to hitch rides every time I need to go somewhere because, get this, there's some rogue meter maid who's decided to have a ticketing vendetta against me and my motorcycle.
Well, Shawn, maybe that might not happen if you didn't park your bike outside your apartment.
Dad, you've seen my street.
The parking is a joke and How did you know that?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How did you know that?
Wait a second.
How How do you know that?
Oh, look who's paying attention now?
You tipped them off?
You tipped them off about my bike?
Who taught you how to drive, Shawn?
Who do you represent every time you're out on that road?
I don't represent anybody when I go out on the road!
Dad, they took my bike!
Tell it to the embassy.
And I might not be able to get it out of the impound.
Yeah, well, then maybe it's time for you to consider a real mode of transportation, huh?
You will do anything you can to impose your will on me.
You hated that bike.
You have always hated that bike.
And you've been especially hard ass about it since I Since you what, Shawn?
Since you what?
Since you had your accident?
Is that is?
Is that where your old man crossed the line?
Fine, I tell you what.
I will back off, I'm gonna lay off, man.
I'll tell you what you do.
You take me off your call list the next time the ambulance picks you up and brings you in that door.
All right?
Fair.
Get over yourself, kid.
Or at least learn how to park.
Shawn, what are you doing?
Do you know what time it is?
What?
What time What time is it?
It's 9:00.
We're late for court.
I called you a million times.
Gus What?
Would you say anger is a good motivator?
Did you see your dad again?
Yes, I did.
And I think it actually worked.
Mr. Hornstock?
Your Honor, the defense has nothing more.
Not so fast.
Excuse me?
Call Priscilla Osterman to the stand.
What are you talking about?
She already testified.
Can we recall her?
Yes, if we have new information, but I have nothing else to ask her.
Oh, trust me.
I'm feeling all kinds of good stuff here.
Your Honor, the defense calls Miss Osterman back to the stand.
Objection.
Overruled.
I'm giving you the teeniest latitude providing you have some new evidence to mine here.
Miss Osterman, I remind you that you are still under oath.
Proceed, Counselor.
Ask her if she is absolutely certain that she did not sleep with Jackson Hale.
Miss Osterman, are you absolutely certain you did not sleep with Jackson Hale?
Objection, Your Honor.
Asked and answered in prior testimony.
Sustained.
I'm not kidding, Counselor, I'm giving you one more question, and then I'm shutting you down.
Did you want to?
Objection!
This man is not a lawyer.
He has no right to address the witness.
Actually, Your Honor, he can, under the rule 775A of the California state rules of evidence.
The rule gives the court wide discretion over the mode and order of presenting evidence, effective for the ascertainment of the truth.
Precedence Killmer v. Duchscherer.
I mean, we are trying to ascertain the truth here, aren't we?
That is absolutely correct, young man.
Where did you attend law school?
Just sixth grade law, Your Honor.
But it was an accelerated program.
Hmm.
It is up to my discretion to allow any testimony that may speak to the truth of this case.
Proceed, Mr. Spencer, with caution.
Thank you, Your Honor.
All right.
Just warming her up for you, bro.
Yeah, go.
Hi, Priscilla.
Hi.
Everybody here is absolutely certain you didn't sleep with Jackson Hale.
But Jackson Hale slept with everybody.
Except for you.
Isn't that right?
You couldn't take it, could you?
Him walking by every single day without ever noticing you.
Not once!
Repeatedly choosing to sleep with women like the defendant, Sandra Panitch!
Oh, that's That's not true.
That video will show Jackson Hale being murdered.
But not by Sandra Panitch.
By you.
Objection, Your Honor.
I mean, this is It's ridiculous.
I feel the tape is the proof!
The tape is the pudding!
Your Honor, I said objection!
I demand you get him to stop that!
Sit down.
Do you need a tutorial in rule 775?
Mr. Riggs, can you please play the tape again?
Thank you.
Just take it back a little bit.
Forward, I'm sorry, forward.
And back.
Forward.
Right there!
Right there.
Right here.
That.
That right there.
It's a cloud.
Not a cloud, a shadow.
A shadow of a human person.
You were wearing those glasses that night, making it unmistakable that you were there.
That is your shadow, Priscilla.
You watched.
You waited, waited for them to drop out of frame.
Then bam on the head to Sandra.
And Into the heart with Jackson!
You didn't think there was any way you could be blamed because clouds don't kill people.
People kill people.
And this was a crime of passion.
But not because he loved you.
But because he didn't.
He walked by me in the hallway every day, like I didn't exist, like I was invisible.
And so you proved him right, by being invisible on that tape.
We would have been the most amazing couple, he just refused to see it.
He just broke my heart over and over and over again.
So, I just broke his!
By stabbing it with a letter opener!
Yes!
Yes, I killed him!
No!
Oh.
Holy crap!
Did you just hear that?
We heard that, yes.
Sorry, Your Honor.
It's just that usually when I do this, when things come to me psychically, I gotta jump through all these hoops, you know?
I gotta find Interim ChiefVic, I gotta run stuff by Lassy, there.
Sign a bunch of papers, t's, i's, the whole bit.
It seems like we got everything we need here.
You, the jury, the stenographer, Mr. Riggs!
I move to remove the defendant immediately.
And take the witness into custody for processing.
Bailiff!
Case dismissed.
You mean to tell me, our whole lives, you've never been to a single auction?
Nope.
Dude, watch this, it's very fun.
How's it fun?
You're bidding against the public for your own motorcycle.
What if somebody outbids you?
I've been practicing my paddle raise, it's very subtle.
Where is this thing?
Plus now that Carter Jarecki's wife has hired us to consult on her divorce, we're flush.
I can go as high as I need to go.
Okay.
Dad?
Shawn!
What are you doing here?
I came for your auction.
What?
Was there a boating incident I didn't hear about?
A little tuna boat get impounded?
You know, actually, Shawn, no.
I felt bad about those tickets, so I'm here to get your bike for you.
Get out of here.
Hey, Shawn!
Gus!
What's up?
Hey, legal eagle!
I thought I might see you here.
Oh, you know?
The name partners were very impressed, and they're anxious to hire you guys again.
Especially this new guy.
What's his name?
Oh, it's me!
Hey!
Congratulations.
You got the bump!
Thank you.
We'd love to work with you again.
So, what is it now, "Hornstock, Hornstock, "Hornstock, Biederman and Hornstock"?
We had to get wider doors, but yes.
Hey, I didn't get to thank you properly.
So, you know, I'm here for the auction.
I'm gonna put some money down on that bike.
Get it back for you.
Guys, really.
I do.
I appreciate it, it's very sweet, but I can stand on my own two feet and get my own bike back.
Shawn!
Buzz.
I believe this is yours.
They just pulled it from the auction.
Pulled it from the auction.
What?
I was I was I've been practicing my paddle raise.
It's a subtle move.
Yeah, you got your bike back.
It was taken care of internally.
What does that mean?
"Internally"?
I don't know.
They just gave me the paperwork.
What are you looking at?
Go home!
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know

Miss.
B6.
Hit.
Shawn!
What?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey.
Knock it off.
Knock it off!
What the heck is going on here?
Mr. Spencer, your son's been cheating.
Have not!
Are, too!
You hit my ships every time.
Both of you, on your feet, now.
Best friends do not accuse each other of cheating.
Best friends do not resort to fighting every time they have an argument.
You both know that I have a partner on the force, right?
Yes, sir.
Well, we couldn't do our job if we didn't trust each other completely.
There are rules to a partnership, and they are the same rules for a friendship.
Even Battleship.
But those rules don't work without what?
Trust, sir.
That's right.
Shawn!
Over here now.
Why aren't there any of your ships on the board?
I knew it!
Cheating?
You're grounded.
But, Dad!
And for the next two months, you are gonna play with one less piece.
But that's not fair.
Exactly, Shawn.
Now you know what it feels like.
Shawn, I can't just give you a case because Gus is out of town this weekend and you're lonely.
Fine, maybe together we can figure out how I can be less lonely.
Wait, I'm getting something.
Baby oil.
This is a photo from about a year ago.
Oh, thank you.
And this is from last week.
Thank you.
We'll call you if we turn anything up on her, Mr. Sirtis.
I appreciate your help, Chief.
Our pleasure.
I'm telling you, I can make the time, Chief.
Your plate is full, Detective.
I already pulled the old file.
If any of your other cases suffer, then I will yank you right off of this Spencer, what the hell are you doing?
Trying something.
I feel conventional vision is weakening my skills.
Is that my scarf?
I I'm getting serviced.
Return service.
No, a net.
Fishnet?
No!
I love somebody.
Now I'm getting Grecian Formula.
That's weird.
It's not about what's there, it's about what's missing.
Tennis equipment.
No, a tennis player is missing.
Björn Borg is missing!
No.
Who's missing?
Congratulations, Mr. Spencer.
You've just joined the case.
What?
We can all pitch in.
Deanna Sirtis was supposed to meet her father Leonard at the airport last night.
They were flying to Tokyo for a tournament but she never showed up.
The last time anyone saw her was at tennis practice that morning.
Has anyone checked out her stalker?
Felix Alvarez?
We're looking into him, since we know he broke into her house a few months ago.
But what we need from you now is to psychically locate Deanna while we follow leads using conventional methods.
You mean, Lassy and I can work together?
Yeah, but separate.
Should we synchronize our watches?
You're not wearing a watch.
That's a good point.
Chief, I'd like to put in a requisition order for a new watch.
Lassy, can you sign for that?
All right, that's enough.
Just Now, let's go do your jobs.
All of you.
Hey!
Thank you.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Gus!
Gus!
Gus!
Gus!
Hello?
Dude, how long until you come back?
We just got here.
Yeah, but you can come home during the weekend, right?
This is a weekend, Shawn.
It's a retreat, with trust exercise to build up a sense of teamwork around the camp.
Camp?
You didn't say you were camping.
Are you making S'mores?
Can I have some?
Have you done "Who's Got My Golden Arm" yet?
Let me come do it?
Shawn, what do you need?
Have you ever heard of Deanna Sirtis?
She's a tennis player.
Local.
Ranked in the low 100s.
She's a missing tennis player.
Ranked 147th.
And she's our new case.
I can't, Shawn.
Reingold just retired.
Ah, yes.
Reingold.
What the hell does that mean?
It means they're reassigning his clients, Shawn.
He has this one doctor with a huge practice.
Dr. Magnotti.
He prescribes in bulk, Shawn.
I'm talking Costco bulk.
I could make my monthly quota in like a day.
But to get him, I gotta schmooze my supervisor.
So you're on our own this time.
Gus!
Guess what, Gus?
Hold on.
We just elected you to be the first one to hold the "sharing stick" What?
in the "sensitivity circle" tonight.
All right, this is great.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, gosh!
That's funny.
It sounded like someone just said "sharing stick".
Dude, get out of there!
I have no choice.
I hate the stupid "sharing stick".
But I couldn't get out of this even if I wanted to.
I've taken care of that already.
Burton!
Why haven't you painted yourself green?
Excuse me?
We're all painting ourselves green.
It's an envy-retention thing.
Oh, it doesn't matter now.
I just heard about your grandmother.
My grandmother?
Slipped in the tub?
Broken hip.
Oh!
Go square her away and get back as soon as you can.
Well, at least we won't forget what she looks like.
My daughter definitely liked having her photo taken.
I think it's what she liked most about winning.
Photography was her hobby, too.
But we don't have a lot of time for hobbies.
You keep a security camera in her room?
That guy, Felix Alvarez, the one the cops are looking for now.
After he broke in, we beefed up security.
I remember reading about that break-in here.
It must have been traumatic for her.
Yeah.
It felt like she never got back to her former self as a player.
Mr. Sirtis, the spirits can be bashful.
Yeah.
Sometimes grumpy, sleepy, dopey, sneezy Shawn.
Shawn!
What I'm saying is, they won't talk to me unless no one is in the room except myself and my compatriot.
That's me.
That includes security cameras.
I'll get it turned off.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Cameras in her room?
Can you say control freak?
Can you say typical sports dad?
What?
These diamonds pretty much nail the four C's.
I bet they're from daddy.
Yeah?
Except for this one.
Look.
This is way too cheap.
See how the gold chips off when you slide it around?
This is from somebody else.
Somebody who's not loaded.
This is an eternity ring.
You're supposed to wear this all the time.
And it's usually given to you by someone, you know, intimate.
Why do you know that?
I gave one to Jessica Chan.
Ah, yes, Jessica Chan.
And how long was eternity for the two of you?
Three months.
But they were awesome months.
Except for the end part.
Right.
I've never seen a girl lie about entering the Witness Protection Program.
She wasn't lying, Shawn!
Gus, I saw her at Starbucks!
You can't be sure of that.
She was wearing a nametag.
She had a plaque on the wall.
"Employee of the Month.
" Her hobbies were hiding and lying about hiding.
Fine.
Whatever.
Drop it.
My point is, why isn't Deanna wearing hers all the time?
She clearly has someone daddy doesn't approve of.
We find the mystery lover, we find her.
Dude, why don't I ever get to say stuff like that?
All right.
Get her down to the station and take her statement.
Nail down the last time she saw Deanna.
I'm on my way in now.
I am sensing you're drinking a nonfat vanilla, half caf with lots of whipped cream but without your usual pink straw.
What, are you two stalking me now?
Or did you come to tell me where the missing girl is?
No.
But I did divine that Deanna has a secret boyfriend, which sounds like a lead to me.
Yeah, we're looking into all her relationships.
But, you see, it's my job to investigate people with things like, you know, motive, means and opportunity.
Stop following me.
What did I say?
Look, man, I've been meaning to have the same conversation with you about leading me.
To be honest, I'm sick of it.
We either walk side by side, or not at all.
Shawn, six months ago I called you up to ask you whether or not you wanted any of this junk.
How come you only call me to come pick up stuff?
You didn't listen, now I'm donating all of it to Goodwill.
I'm on my way there right now, so you got about 30 seconds, last looks.
No, no, no.
You cannot throw out my Whitesnake T-shirt.
You can't get this in stores anymore.
That is This is my Airwolfwindbreaker.
I've been looking for this for like five years now.
Why did you take this?
I never even saw you wear it.
Of course I didn't wear it.
I took it, so you wouldn't.
Don't put it on.
Gus, nobody had an Airwolfjacket except Jan-Michael Vincent.
This looks like a custom Sak-Hart graphite rod and reel.
That's right.
Good eye.
You can't throw something like this away.
It's 15 years old.
Fifteen?
Looks brand-new.
Oh, that's because it's never been used.
Bought it for him.
Man, I have been itching to get out on the blue and hook some snapper, but you know what a chore it is to get the boat and You're welcome to come with me tomorrow morning.
Boat leaves at 5:00 a. m. sharp.
Princess here, never could get him up.
Look, the American Medical Association clearly states the proper amount of sleep Well, if you're sure you don't mind a little company?
If you're sure you can be there at 5:00 a. m. I'll be on the docks at 4:15 a. m. Spencer.
What just happened here?
I think your dad just made his first play-date.
It's not funny.
It is.
He gave away my custom something something pole.
I loved that thing.
You gonna get it back?
No.
We are going to the Vista Rico Health and Racquet club.
Now's not the time for a steam, Shawn.
Gus, Deanna was seen practicing there the morning she disappeared.
If she's some sort of tennis star, she probably goes there a lot.
Maybe someone saw her with her mystery lover!
How did that sound?
It feels like you're pushing.
You're pressing.
Deanna's coach is in Tokyo, but the manager said this girl was here practicing the last time Deanna was.
Sweet.
Excuse me, can we talk to you for a second?
I only have 11 minutes left to practice.
Yeah, but isn't it better if someone's over there to return your serve?
You play?
No, but this is Vernest Lambert Watkins.
He was a junior champion of some junior league.
What did you guys call yourselves?
The Little Green Fuzzymen?
The Yellow Hornets.
But that was like 10 years ago.
He'll give you a workout.
We're just gonna have a chat.
Racket's over here?
Now, I can sense that you were here the day Deanna disappeared.
Duh.
Everybody knows we hit together.
What are you, a genius?
Actually, I'm a psychic.
And I don't think I like your tone.
Let me rephrase that, and don't read anything into my tone, why do you think she didn't show up to that tournament in Tokyo?
Out.
Out?
Out my ass!
You can't be serious.
That ball was clearly on the line!
Long.
Long by a hair, buddy.
Any ideas?
You know what her weakness was?
Kittens?
Focus.
All she thought about was boys.
Cowboy up there, buddy.
Shut up.
Any boys in particular?
She was not particular at all.
But I heard she started hanging out with that Doug Lenmar.
Doug Lenmar?
He's one of the top-ranked players on the men's tour.
He stinks.
No net game.
Her father totally freaked when he found out and told her to end it.
Then she tried to be all rebellious and stormed off the court.
How grody of her.
Grody?
Grody to the max?
Grody with a spoon.
Come on, work with me.
I don't know what the kids are saying these days.
I don't remember anything else.
That's all I heard.
Well, you hear a lot.
Coaches are more gossipy than housewives.
Just watch.
In five years, she'll be knocked up and living in government assisted housing.
It's good to see the game hasn't hardened you.
Out!
Okay, so we know she had a secret boyfriend, Doug Lenmar.
But if he was in Tokyo, why would she go to see him?
Let's find out if he really is in Tokyo.
If so, plan B. She was boy-crazy.
There's got to be more than one dude in the mix.
Maybe she's not missing.
Maybe she's hiding.
To keep her dad off her case.
But where would she hide?
Ooh.
What?
I have the urge to suddenly get my bunions buffed.
Shawn, this is completely unnecessary.
Deanna was here.
We have to retrace her steps.
In a paraffin wax dip?
You know how flaky my knuckles get.
Two birds, one stone.
I've never felt so productive.
And exactly how much information do you plan on getting from a manicurist that can't speak English?
None so far.
Hold on.
Dude.
Hurry up!
She was here yesterday.
Check that out.
Gus, you're gonna smudge my gloss.
She ordered nail protein solution.
So she has weak, peeling nails.
No, genius.
The billing address is her father's place, but the delivery address is someplace else.
Nice focus, Gus.
Thank you.
Maybe you're ready to take on that little girl again.
Gus, I feel good about this.
She's gonna be here.
Safe and sound.
Or not.
All right, I want to talk to her the minute she wakes up.
If she wakes up.
What happened here?
This isn't a missing person case any more.
It's attempted murder.
Man, even she gets to say stuff like that.
That's more crappy jewelry.
That means the working-class boyfriend has been here.
Hey, aren't you Henry Spencer's kid?
That I am.
I took a six-week course he taught at the academy.
Lucky you.
How was he?
Yeah, that just about sums it up.
Do you mind if we poke around a little?
No.
We do.
We mind quite a bit actually.
You know what, scratch that.
I'm gonna let you guys stick around to see what real detectives do.
Sweet!
Just let us know when they arrive.
Deanna shared this place with another player on the tour, so her name wasn't on the lease.
But Lassiter found one of her close friends.
Apparently, they met frequently at that Indian restaurant.
We canvassed the area with her photo and the owner of this building recognized her.
So we opened the door and voilá.
Voilá.
O'Hara, come take a look at this.
Check this out.
I think these were all taken inside this apartment.
I think you're right.
Wait a second.
What?
I see something!
I see a trophy.
But I'm out of place.
I've been kidnapped.
There is a trophy missing from here.
And we know she suffered a blunt force trauma.
Possibly the weapon.
Good work, O'Hara.
O'Hara?
That was all us!
I think your tutorial in police work is done now.
Goodbye.
It's cool.
I've got everything we need.
Deanna is listed as critical but stable for now.
She's touch and go for the next 48 hours.
50 pounds and is considered to be armed and dangerous.
Anyone with information as to the whereabouts of this man Gosh!
Finding Deanna lit a fire under the department.
Lassiter's been having these advisory alerts run 24/7.
So let me get this straight.
Their theory is that Felix followed her to her hideaway, and showed his love by trying to kill her?
Not a terrible theory.
Let's review, shall we?
No forced entry.
That means she either let the attacker in or he had a key.
Sounds like someone she was intimate with.
Now, the toilet seat in her apartment was up.
So we know there was a guy there recently.
I doubt the killer stopped to use the little boy's room, so let's assume the phantom boyfriend stopped by for a matinee.
And there were two wine glasses missing from her set.
So she probably shared a drink with him, and he grabbed the glasses which had his fingerprints on them as he beat a discreet retreat.
None of that points to Felix.
I gotta get back to work.
Now?
You're gonna leave now?
When we're up to our necks in intrigue?
The case is almost closed.
We have the girl, she's still alive.
The cops beat us.
Let them have this one.
How can you be so negative?
Easy.
I need face time with my boss.
I already missed the pamper pole trust exercise.
I'm uncomfortable with you even saying the words "pamper pole".
Look, every minute the cops spend looking for Felix, the real attacker breathes easier.
Now we have got to convince them to start looking for other suspects.
No.
Unless you can give us something more substantial, Mr. Spencer, we're gonna continue the manhunt for Felix Alvarez.
Manhunt?
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, I can project Tommy Lee Jones from The Fugitive if you'd like.
I want a hard-target search for every outhouse, henhouse, cathouse, waffle house, House M.D. House of the Long Shadows?
What?
Crime scene photos, Detective.
It's about time.
Were you on a break?
Hey!
Dad?
Now what?
I just stopped by to drop off this hat for Mr. Lassiter, so he can look the part next time we go out and catch us some snapper.
Thanks.
The next time you go out and Isn't that my hat?
What are you doing here?
Oh, you know, just interrupting an official briefing, and being in general, pain in my ass.
Oh, well, try living with him for 17 years.
Excuse me.
I have a killer to catch.
Good luck with that.
And time!
Nicely done.
Excuse me a second.
What're you doing here?
Dude, you turned off your cell phone.
Some might take that as a hint.
As in, "Leave me alone.
" Burton, you're not having visitors, are you?
You know my policy on visitors.
He's not a visitor Jerry Hathaway.
I too work at Central Coast.
In the lab.
Yes, I worked on the mono-thio-Huxtable drug.
It's for pancake- reactic function.
Pancreatic.
Actually, no, Burton.
It was pancake.
Really?
Yes, there are properties in the batter that help to stabilize the ions we were working with.
I never heard of that project.
It was a great drug.
But it caused headaches, stomach aches, tooth aches, weight gain, weight loss, balding, sever oily bowel discharge, and in very rare cases it made you pee fire.
Wow!
Yeah.
So the higher-ups shelved the project, much to my chagrin.
I thought I knew all the lab guys.
I'm surprised we've never met before.
I don't make much of an impact on other human beings.
It's terrible for my self esteem.
In fact, I've been here all weekend, and this is the first conversation I've had.
And, Tom, you should know that nobody made me a nametag.
You know what we say about that here.
Hello.
Hi, Tom.
No, I mean the motto of the weekend.
H-E-L-L-O.
Lop off the last letter and you've got what this weekend really is.
Stands for Health, Esteem, Life, Love and Openness.
Well, that's pretty keen, Tom.
You know, in the spirit of openness, I've always looked up to Gus.
He's everything I wish I was.
Do you think maybe we could work on the next exercise together?
No, we can't do that.
Burton!
I believe your friend is reaching out right now.
I think you two would be perfect candidates for the Minefield.
Burton, you have to keep your eyes closed while your friend leads you through a series of obstacles.
Oh, Tom!
That sounds really bitching!
Can I talk to him alone for a second?
Sure!
Oh, great, thanks!
Oh, gosh.
Dude, I've got bad news.
What?
Deanna's doctors say she showing signs of improvement.
Shawn, in the health care community, we call that good news.
Given what we already know?
Did she know her attacker?
Yes.
Does that mean when she wakes up she can ID him?
She ID's him and the case is closed.
Where's the downside?
Because if you're the bad guy and you know that your victim could wake up and point the finger at you He'll find her and finish her off!
You're just not landing it.
The point is, Deanna's life is in danger now more then ever, and she needs us.
Burton, is there a problem?
Yes, Tom, I'm afraid there is.
Burton's grandmother just called.
She's broken her hip.
I thought you dealt with that issue already.
The other side.
Tore the M.C.L.
She did it while trying to do her line dancing classes.
Why was an 87-year-old woman with a broken hip attending a line dancing class?
Attending?
She was teaching it.
You leave my grandson alone.
He's a good boy.
Oh, yeah.
Then why did he run when he saw us coming?
Because you guys got my face plastered all over the TV for something I didn't do, man.
I'm innocent!
I don't even think about her anymore.
Yeah, see, that's what all the crazy stalkers say.
Stop!
Just stop.
Hey, what the hell?
What are you doing?
Get your hand off him.
He's reading his guilt.
Give him a second.
Hamana, Hamana, Hamana, Hamana, Ricky, Enrique, Heraldo, Menudo, Richie!
This man is true to his word.
He's pure of heart.
He made many mistakes in his past.
Dirty, filthy mistake.
See, I'm not telling you anything you don't already know here.
But he didn't attack Deanna.
Really?
If he's so pure of heart, why did we find the trophy that she was nearly bludgeoned to death with in his car?
The raven crows only at midnight, dusk is for the rooster's cackle.
What?
Jules, that's your cue to cackle.
Shawn, I don't have a cackle in my repertoire.
What, you called for this secret meeting.
We should use code-speak in case people are listening?
It's not secret.
Just away from prying eyes.
So what do you propose?
Should we rent one of those pedal boats that looks like a swan?
We could, or you could just take these.
What is this?
Copies of the files on Felix Alvarez.
Why are you giving this to me?
I've talked to the kid, his grandmother and the court-ordered psychiatrist he had to see after breaking into Deanna's house.
They all say the months of counseling paid off.
He was rehabilitated.
And he had a medical condition that required dialysis.
My great-aunt needed dialysis, and she was always knockdown-dragout, winter-bear tired afterward.
And his last appointment probably left him way too winter-bear tired to stalk and attack Deanna.
Exactly.
And just what did the police do when you fed them this peculiar piece of info-gristle?
They spit it out.
In fact, they're so certain that he's the guy, they've taken the 24-hour guard off of Deanna's hospital room.
Jules, that's no good.
You gotta get security back on that door.
The killer will come back.
He'll try again.
At the very least, her dad is always by her bedside.
Have you seen that dude?
She needs more security than a 60-year-old in a track suit.
Look, without protection, you might as well just send the killer an invitation, saying, "Hey, come on back, finish the job.
" I wonder if they make invitations for that.
I don't see why not.
You can send an evite for anything.
This is true.
Lassiter thinks it's an inefficient use of manpower.
I'll see what I can divine.
What's this?
It's rest of the paperwork on Felix's first break-in.
I figure you need all this information to do your psychic stuff.
I can feel these two crimes were not committed by the same person.
But in order for your brothers in blue to be wrong, we're saying Felix was framed.
We're saying it was somebody who knew he would be targeted by the police.
You're saying it.
I'm stealthily lending an ear, I'm saying it was an excellent, slam-dunk frame-up.
This somebody was a pretty bad guy.
Yes.
Ugly on the inside.
Thought of every detail.
A virtual hunchback mastermind Shawn!
Just let me know what you find.
And remember, psychic intuition's not gonna help this guy.
Evidence will.
Oh, one more thing.
Roosters don't cackle.
I beg your pardon.
They cock-a-doodle-doo.
You've got to be kidding me.
Shawn, what are you doing here?
I don't know.
I guess I took a wrong turn and ended it up in The Twilight Zone.
What the hell's going on here?
What?
We caught us some lunch this morning.
Hooked them, cooked them and ate them.
How tribal of you.
Shawn never really was one for roughing it.
We went camping once, found him curled up inside his sleeping bag because a raccoon was hunting him.
Stalking me.
The raccoon was stalking me, Dad.
And I came to talk to you.
Alone.
All righty.
So, what's wrong?
All right, here's the thing.
Why is there a picture of Lassiter on your refrigerator?
That's a picture of the fish.
I didn't even know he was in there.
What could you guys possibly talk about out there?
Shawn, that is the beauty part.
Nothing.
He knows to sit there, shut up and fish.
What?
You think we sit out there, we yap about you all day long?
I can't really wrap my brain around any of it.
All right, so what's so important?
I'm working on a case.
And I know that they've arrested the wrong guy.
What makes you so sure?
The M.O. Right?
This guy in custody, he trashes a girl's house, trashes it, but then, at the apartment when they find her, it's practically sterile.
I'm talking about a perfect crime scene.
But I cannot find anything in these police reports to back me up.
Right there.
You see, right there.
That's your first problem.
What?
The police reports.
Shawn, a police report is always from somebody else's point of view.
I've written a ton of them myself, and one thing you cannot do is take them as gospel.
All right?
So let's run this again.
Now you've been to both crime scenes, right?
Right.
Well, the first one was after the fact, but I've been to both places, yeah.
Okay.
So close your eyes.
Dad, I didn't come here to take a stupid test.
Can't we just talk as men?
Shawn, would you trust your old man for once, just once?
Close your eyes.
Here we go.
All right, now I want you to go back to the first crime scene.
This poor girl's house.
What do you see?
What do I see?
Her bed.
Tennis trophies.
Jewelry box.
Mostly nice jewelry.
A wall of photos featuring her.
Come on, keep going.
Keep going, Shawn, what else?
No, there is nothing else.
The guy was there way before me.
Everything looks different now.
Okay.
Okay.
Now let's go to the second crime scene.
To this apartment where she was found.
Can we stop on the way and get donuts?
Shawn, focus.
Keep your eyes closed.
What do you see?
Wait a minute.
Thank you, Dad.
I have a crime scene to break into.
I can't believe you pulled me out of my retreat.
I can kiss my chances of getting Dr. Feelgood on my route goodbye.
Gus, what time do you have?
Where's your watch at?
It's a key tanning month.
It's around the same time we were here before.
So, why are all these clocks wrong?
Dude, I need you to lay the ground, pretend like you're Deanna.
I am not pretending to be a woman half beaten to death, Shawn.
You know what?
I am starting to wonder if you have trust issues with me.
Really?
Yes.
First, you wouldn't do the Minefield, now you won't lay on the floor and pretend to be an unconscious woman for me.
What's going on with you?
Two words.
Airwolfwindbreaker.
Okay, two more.
Airwolfwindbreaker.
Battleship.
Dude, that was like a million years ago.
I'm just saying.
I never cheated again.
Now can we please just do this?
What is the point in me pretending to be Deanna?
Something here's weird, okay?
When I was with my dad, I realized the shadows coming off those two lamps were in the wrong spots.
I think someone tampered with this crime scene.
Who could do that?
Someone smart.
Someone experienced.
Which is why we need to recreate the scene so that it is exactly the way it was when the cops got here.
All right.
Fine.
Fine.
Now, in the landlord's statement, he said the body was found here in the supine position.
So, please, if you will Sure.
Just tell me what supine means.
Gus, supine.
Su Mmm-hmm.
pine.
You don't knowwhat the word means, do you?
Okay, fine.
You win.
Mr. Vocabulary wins.
Mr. Vocab is the big winner tonight, everybody.
Thank you.
No, please, please.
It means on your back.
I knew that.
No, you didn't.
Okay.
This is off.
The lamp is in the same spot, but the shadows aren't.
And something else is wrong.
There are six pictures on this bookshelf, there are six pictures in this photo.
What do you expect?
Seven.
I clearly remember seven photos, Gus.
There were two pictures on each shelf and one shelf with one.
That's seven.
It was right here.
Where this box is.
Can you remember what's in the missing photo?
I'm not sure.
What the hell is going on?
Nothing, man.
Nothing?
Is that guy dead?
Damn it.
Now you've seen too much.
I didn't see anything.
Yeah, you did.
You're in this just as deep as I am now.
We're gonna have to work together.
Okay?
I assume this building has an incinerator?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay.
So we just have to chop up the body and then we put the limbs in little plastic baggies.
The torso, we're gonna have to melt down with a blow torch.
Okay, I've heard enough.
Chop up his body?
And then you wonder why I don't trust you?
Are we done yet?
One last thing.
Hurry up, Shawn.
Shawn, I left my retreat to solve a crime, not to order takeout.
That's exactly what we're doing.
Hi, there.
What time do you turn those lights on?
At 5:00, for the beginning of the dinner crowd.
Never any earlier for any reason whatsoever?
It's on a timer.
What the hell is the point?
I think I know who the killer is.
Just one more question.
And this is absolutely critical.
Do your samosas come with that red onion chutney?
I arraigned Felix today.
If he's smart he'll just plead out.
Next is the Jimminy Crickets.
What?
He's sensing an anomaly in the space-time continuum.
Oh, it's very serious.
They can unravel the fabric of reality itself.
We've been trailing it from across town.
The distortion is near.
Bless you.
Thank you.
It's in the photos in the file!
Yes.
The photos are lying.
That is the anomaly.
It was the distortion that prevented me from divining dirty Deanna's attacker.
But now, now I have a clear image.
We already know who attacked her.
He's right, Mr. Spencer.
He's wrong.
The bludgeoner is close.
Follow me.
Yes!
No!
No.
Bludgeoner.
What, are you nuts?
He works for us!
The photos.
Look at the photos.
Jules, Jules, Jules, what's going on with the lights in the background, in the window?
Oh, he's right.
The lights in the restaurant are on in these photos.
They were off when we found Deanna.
What?
This is crazy.
Why would I attack some woman I've never met before?
Never met?
Didn't you photograph her house when that Felix guy broke in?
Yes, that's when you met her then.
Dude!
She liked meeting new people.
And she liked to party.
And she liked to have her photo taken.
And guess who takes photos for a living.
You!
And it was nice, and it was on, and you were giving it to her, and she liked it.
Until she met somebody who could afford to buy her nicer jewelry than you.
She was on her way to see him in Tokyo.
You decided to confront her at her apartment.
Hey, trophy!
And then you cleaned it all up, and you made it nice, and you left a perfect crime scene.
Then you came back here, and assumed your capacity as police photographer.
You scrutinized the photos, making sure there was no trace of your presence in that apartment.
Oversight.
This bag.
Sure enough, in a photo on her bookshelf.
Your bag with your initials, that the police have seen a million times.
They'd have known it was you.
So what did you do?
You waited for the forensics guys to split, and you snuck back inside.
You were meticulous.
You took the time to turn the clocks back to the right time, and you re-photographed the whole scene without the incriminating photo.
And you re-submitted those as the originals.
But I can feel that you forgot to reset the clocks to the correct time before leaving.
Oh, Gus.
Take him into custody until we figure this whole thing out.
So the prophecy has been fulfilled.
What?
What are you talking about?
What prophecy?
Nothing.
I just figured it was finally my chance to say something dramatic.
Father!
Hey, Pop.
Shawn, God What are you, sleeping one off?
No.
I couldn't sleep last night, my back's all out of whack.
Oh.
God.
Hey, I hear they arrested one of the forensics guys.
Yup.
They grilled him like panini.
He confessed to the whole thing.
And the police found a fake hospital badge at his apartment.
They think he was gonna try to kill her last night.
How's the girl?
The doctors say she's gonna pull through.
There he is!
Well, you're here, but you're not gonna go out like that, are you?
Yeah, I can't make it tonight.
I gotta work a double.
Hey, I know.
Why don't you take Junior here?
I'll catch you next week.
What are you talking about?
Didn't you just work back-to-back shifts on that tennis thing?
Okay, fine.
You got me.
All right.
He's actually capable of taking all the fun out of fishing.
He criticized my pole technique for like three hours.
It's holding a pole in the water.
What is there to criticize?
Hey, ease up.
That's my pop you're talking about.
I'm beginning to understand you a little better, Spencer.
Burton, you're back.
Sorry I missed today's program, sir.
Well, it's okay.
I tried out a new trust exercise where I pull a rubber band back as far as I can and hold it up to my trust partner's eye, and I say, "Do you trust me?
Do you trust me"?
Wow.
How did that go?
I wish my grip was better.
But the cornea is resilient.
That's true, Tom, I've heard that.
Now, Burton here hates to drag his personal life into work matters, but I feel like you should know, his dear grandmother somehow managed to dislocate both of her shoulders, too.
I think it was the chin-ups she was trying to do on the traction bar.
Burton, you have missed almost every exercise we had arranged for this weekend.
You left a work function to tend to your ailing grandmother, even if it was detrimental to your career.
You know what that tells me?
Tells me you really care about people.
I do.
He does.
And after getting in touch with my feelings this weekend, I think that's exactly what the Central Coast Pharmaceutical Company is all about.
Yes.
Okay.
Burton's grandmother is gonna need a little extra caring after.
He would never complain because I know he loves his job, but if there was any way that his route could be a little less time Save your breath.
Burton, I know that everybody here wants to get Dr. Magnotti, why don't you swap him out for a couple of your less-productive clients?
Oh, wow.
Wow.
Thank you, Tom.
And my grandmother thanks you, as a matter of fact.
Well, I'll tell you what.
Once she's feeling better, I want you two to come on over to my house and have dinner with my wife and I. Oh, no, we couldn't.
We couldn't.
Lizzie makes a fondue that'll knock your socks off.
Block of cheese about the size of a house cat.
We're gonna melt it down and gobble it up.
Okay.
All right.
Sure.
We'd be honored.
And don't be such a stranger.
Hello, Tom.
Hello!
I am so screwed.
Why?
He wants to meet my grandmother.
So?
So?
You know that one of them is dead and the other one lives in Jamaica.
Dude, relax.
I know like five people that could easily play your grandmother.
Okay, so you know a line-dancing octogenarian who can do chin-ups and has two broken hips?
Yeah, as long as she can be Chinese.
Just trust me.
Never mind.
Oh, you do trust me, right?
I mean, I know it's a silly thing to say after all these years, but we don't have to do these kinds of exercises, do we?
Battleship rematch?
No, that's all right.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
I'll raise.
I've got a good feeling about this hand.
Too rich for me.
Fold.
Big surprise, rookie.
That's all you ever do is fold.
Call.
What do you say to that, big shot?
I say The last card didn't make Mr. O'Grady's flush.
Mr. Duritz was smart to fold 'cause he missed his straight.
And you, Mr. Hastings, your cards just stink.
You're bluffing.
I call.
Two pair, Jacks and 7s.
Oh!
Damn it!
Every time.
You'd think we'd know better by now.
What the hell is goin' on here?
Poker, Shawn?
Poker?
What were you thinking?
I don't know.
I get bored waiting.
Oh, well, why didn't you just say so?
I mean, if you're bored, I guess it's okay.
What is wrong with you?
How do you even know how to play poker?
Mr. Hastings taught me.
Hastings, uh?
Well, I want it to stop.
Do you understand?
No more poker, no more gambling.
You're too young.
Dad, I don't gamble.
I win.
You win?
Oh, uh-huh.
And approximately how often do you lose?
I don't know.
You don't know.
Well, I haven't lost yet.
How much?
How much did you win?
Is that it?
All right, son, listen to me.
Just because you can do something doesn't always mean that you should do it, do you understand what I'm saying?
No.
Hey, that's mine!
Not anymore.
Yes, it is!
Uh-uh, no.
No, no, no, no.
I'm giving it away.
Giving it away.
Why?
Because I can.
And according to your little philosophy, your poker philosophy, if I can, then I should, right?
I know it might seem like you're gonna win every time, Shawn, but no matter how good you are, there's always somebody who's better.
And there's one rule in gambling, the house always wins.
Eventually.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Don't gamble.
Not for money.
I got 10 bucks says you can't make this shot.
Ooh!
Gus, I can't take your money.
That's right.
'Cause you can't make the shot.
I could easily make the shot, which is why I can't take your money.
There's no sport in it.
I say you're all mouth.
I'm all mouth?
Yep.
All right.
Sail straight, my precious.
Okay.
Double or nothing.
Trivia question this time.
History.
Grover Cleveland.
Damn!
How do you do that?
It's the sweetness.
So, this is how you spend your days.
Oh, my God!
Dad, what are you doing here?
Nice.
Is that the way you greet all the people that come through your door?
That's exactly how I greet everyone.
Maybe that's why business is down.
Hmm.
Are you gonna invite me in?
Oh, yeah, please No!
This could be a trick.
What's the rule with vampires, don't they have to be invited in?
What are you talking about, Shawn?
Gus, you've seen Lost Boys You're on your own.
Is this all there is?
Actually, this is the, uh, satellite office.
Main headquarters is in an underground ice cave Gus and I sculpted last winter.
What about your license?
Ahem, my pilot's license?
It's out back in the Cessna.
Or perhaps you're referring to my license to kill.
Revoked.
Problems at the Kazakhstan border.
I could give you the details, but then I'd have to kill you, which I can't do because my license to kill has been revoked.
I'm talkin' about your private eye license.
Well, you need one, don't ya?
Psychics are exempt from the requirements.
Oh, well, hurray for loopholes!
A little dark.
Probably could use a couple more lamps, you know, probably killing your eyes.
That outlet Ah, yeah, looks a little overloaded.
Yeah, I think that plasma, you'd probably do better by puttin' it on that wall, you'd have less glare comin' in through the window in the afternoon.
You know what, Dad, I really appreciate you makin' the long drive down and Feng Shui it up sweet for us, but we're kind of in the middle of something here.
What would that be, Shawn?
Would that be NBA garbage can hoops, or trivia super challenge?
Believe it or not, we have an 11:00.
So maybe we should wrap this up.
Yeah, it's a little too late for that, Shawn.
I am your 11:00.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Bill Peterson.
He owns Peterson Motors.
Met him about 20 years ago when I grabbed a couple of punks boosting tires off of his lot.
Shawn, shouldn't you be writing some of this down?
Why would I do that?
Will there be a quiz?
Just shut up and pay attention.
I got a call from him yesterday.
He's got a kid, Brandon.
He's just a little younger than you.
He thinks his son might be mixed up in something.
Like what?
Well, he'll fill you in when he gets here.
The point is, he doesn't want the cops involved.
So, he called me.
And you said I said I'm retired and he should definitely involve the cops.
Sweet.
You came all the way down here to tell us that.
Awesome.
No, Shawn.
He doesn't want his son in trouble, and I might have mentioned to Peterson accidentally that, you, uh You might be able to help.
Whoa, time out!
Flag on the play!
Did you vouch for me?
No, I wouldn't say I exactly vouched for you.
Gus, Henry vouched for me.
I did not vouch for you!
You were bragging on me.
You have a dad-crush on me.
Shawn, I was not bragging on you.
I merely restated stats about your track record that are in the newspaper.
Let's hug it out.
Put your arms down.
Gimme a hug.
Put your No, I'm not gonna give you If I'd known that Peterson was gonna insist on hiring you, I would've blasted your character outright and I would've mentioned your unnatural fear of pointy things.
Ah!
Distaste for pointy things.
Please, just do me this one favor.
Would you listen to the man's story, tell him you can't help?
Send him to the cops, and whatever you do, don't do it with all that rolling your eyes around and all that floppy crap.
What is this?
First of all, I don't flop around all the time, okay?
My game is predicated on finesse.
How dare you criticize my job?
He's here, he's here.
Okay, don't tell him I came by.
You got a back way out of this place?
You came through it.
Oh, right.
Excuse me, you Shawn?
Yes, that's correct, Mr. Peterson.
Wow, that is my name.
Don't be too impressed, Bill, I could have gotten that information anywhere.
After all, Peterson Motors is gigantic.
Yeah, well, I'm suitably impressed.
Don't be.
Burton Guster.
Pleasure to meet you.
Look, I'll get right to it.
I have a son, Brandon.
Up until a few weeks ago, he worked for me.
Now he's disappeared.
What happened a few weeks ago?
I fired him.
He was lazy, directionless.
I thought I could get him to buckle down, focus in on something.
How did that go?
Well, he's been evicted from his apartment, his cell phone's been cut off and he forged a check from my account to the tune of $30,000.
I need to find my son.
Can you help me?
Well, Mr. Peterson, this sounds like a case for the police.
Let me get you a number.
Gus, don't be a gooey chocolate chip cookie.
What?
This is precisely what we do here, sir.
We find people.
We'll find your Brandon.
Okay, make sure we are not disturbed.
I need five minutes uninterrupted.
Make sure no one comes in.
Yeah.
What's with all the secrecy, O'Hara?
I've got a real mindbender.
Problem with the railway theft?
No.
It's a detective.
Is this something for Internal Affairs?
It's Detective Lassiter.
What's the problem with our Head Detective?
Well, it's his birthday.
Oh, that's not a problem.
Yeah!
It is!
He seems quiet.
He is quiet.
That's who he is.
Look, O'Hara, I think it's nice that you care for your partner, but he is a grown man.
He'll be fine.
I just thought it would be nice to surprise him.
Oh Detective Lassiter does not like surprises.
Of course he likes surprises.
Everybody likes surprises.
Detective Lassiter has a very particular comfort zone.
And you don't even wanna know what we now call the Secret Santa Debacle of 2005.
I just wanted to do something nice for him, but nobody seems to know what he likes!
Well, you're his partner, shouldn't you know?
Well, we don't really talk.
I mean, he doesn't.
He nods and responds mostly.
He never really poses a question.
Although sometimes he asks if we can ride in silence.
O'Hara, your heart is in the right place, but I am very sure that you're gonna have to do this yourself.
Okay, fine.
Shawn, what are we doin' here?
Brandon's dad said he was evicted.
Gus, let me ask you something.
When's the last time you were evicted from your apartment?
Never!
Exactly.
You wouldn't understand.
This is my world.
So the landlord keeps Brandon's stuff as collateral.
Brandon comes back, the landlord gets paid, Brandon doesn't, there's a garage sale.
Well, the buzzer upstairs says that his is 227.
Regina King.
Jackée!
Hal Williams.
Hal Williams?
Hal Williams as Lester Jenkins.
Yeah, right.
Looks like somebody took a screwdriver to this thing.
Lemme see.
Okay, so Brandon needed something inside here, but he couldn't get in.
If you were in his shoes, what would you do next?
First of all, I'd feel very ashamed of myself.
Tell me about it.
But then, I think I'd come back with some scissors.
Let's see if we can find what he's reaching for.
Yeah, lemme reach.
My reach is better.
Excuse me?
What?
When exactly did we have a reaching contest?
My reach has always been better.
But my arms are slender-erer.
Slender-erer?
What?
Slendererer Skinnier?
Yes.
You know what?
You're right.
My biceps probably wouldn't fit through this thing anyway.
I knew you'd fall for that!
Let me see.
Hmm.
Final notice, final notice, final notice, plus an eviction?
Gosh, this kid has some serious cash flow problems.
No wonder why he stole from his pops.
What do you got?
A bunch of pawnshops.
Whoa!
Wait a second.
If you're a guy with an apartment, what's the one thing you definitely don't have?
I don't know.
A horse?
A horse, that's true!
Answer we were looking for was yard or garden.
I would have accepted both yard and garden.
I was joking, Shawn.
So if you're a guy without a yard or a garden Shawn!
why would you have a business card for a garden supply store?
What is R-R-L-R-L-L?
Rrlrll.
Rrlrll.
Of course.
Rrlrll.
No, no.
Rrlrll!
Rrlrll.
What does it mean?
We should probably figure that out, huh?
You think?
How long are we gonna sit here?
Brandon might not even show up.
When I suggested we do a stakeout, you were, like, "No, no, we need to do something active.
" I am doing something active.
What?
I'm preparing to try and enjoy this chalupa.
Odd.
No, what's odd, the customers that keep driving into this place.
Look at these cars.
They're ridiculous!
They're all fancy and what not.
Not exactly what you'd use to pick up shrubs and fertilizer.
Let's see what these people are up to.
Let's go!
Ah!
Wrong turn.
What the Dude, it's a maze.
What is "R-R-L-R-L-L"?
Shawn, what are you doing?
Right, right.
Dude, the letters on the back of that card were directions.
Follow me.
All right.
Right.
Rrlrll Rrlrll, rrlrll.
Shawn!
Right.
Left Left Yes!
Whoa, wait a second.
Wait a second.
Maybe we should take a peek and see what we're getting into, Shawn.
Ooh, you know what this is, Shawn?
It's one of those underground poker games.
My poker buddies talk about them.
Since when do you have poker buddies?
My online poker buddies, Shawn.
I'm good.
I'm up $7 million dollars.
You have $7 million dollars and you failed to mention it to me till just now?
It's not real money, Shawn.
That's illegal.
Rough luck there again, huh?
Yeah, a bit of bad luck.
Dude, you should get in this game.
How?
These games are tight.
You gotta know somebody to get in.
Well, let's just throw Brandon's name around, maybe they'll let us in.
Uh, yeah, one more hand, I'll get it.
It's just not working out for you today, is it?
No.
Not right now.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you stand up here?
I'm just gonna Come on.
Come here.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
Just relax now.
Put your hand up like this.
Why?
Just hold it up.
There you go.
Now, maybe next time, you won't force me into such a barbaric form of retribution.
Good news, there appears to be a seat opening up.
Still, I think our best course of action would be Get the hell outta here!
Go!
Go!
Go, go!
I want you to know I cannot hear anything you say!
Shawn, what the hell is going on?
What the Shawn, what are you doing?
It's his ongoing sensory-deprivation experiment, sharpening one sense by denying others.
In this case, he can't hear, which only amplifies his sense of smell.
What?
Amazing!
That's one word for it.
I need complete and utter silence.
What do you need silence for, Shawn, if you can't hear anything?
Shh!
Please!
Henry, let the boy work.
I smell chips!
Potato, po-tah-to!
Let's call the whole thing off!
Mr. Peterson, I want you to grab my arm.
Both hands, like you're doing a pull-up.
Feel the burn.
I will now become a conduit to your son's thoughts.
Please, clear your mind and your nasal passages.
Think of nothing but Brandon and those chips.
Gus, present spuds!
I'm getting something.
It's not clear.
That's a shocker.
Oh, ah, I'm wrong!
It's not potato!
Gus, lose the spuds!
Chips!
Ponch!
John!
Striker!
Cracker!
Poker!
Poker?
I hardly know her!
Shawn.
Poker chips!
Well, what the hell do poker chips smell like, Shawn?
They smell like butterflies.
Poker chips And playing cards.
Ah!
What?
What about the poker chips and the playing cards?
Ah!
Gus, it burns!
The link has been broken.
I'll have to read the cards, see what they say.
Shawn!
There's your son.
Notice there are no diamonds around him.
Well, diamonds represent wealth.
So Brandon lost his wealth playing poker?
That's correct, Gus.
Yeah, well, what do all these clubs around him mean, Shawn?
Clubs, clubs are like clover.
He's been playing poker in a garden.
With this guy.
We need a name.
Has he mentioned any of the guys he plays poker with?
DumbLuck2.
That was his online screen name.
I kept seeing it on his computer when he was supposed to be working.
DumbLuck2.
Here, you can have Brandon.
Thanks.
Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Lassiter?
Yes?
Who is this?
What do you want?
It's about your son.
Oh, no!
It's the phone call!
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no!
It's not It's not that.
Well, then, who the hell are you?
I'm his partner.
But you're a woman.
Yes.
Shocking, isn't it?
What are you, fulfilling a quota?
If you get him shot I'm not getting him shot!
I just need to ask a few personal questions.
Personal questions?
You're not a cop.
This is some kind of Internet scam, isn't it?
You'll want my Social Security number next, right?
Well, suck lemons, Cookiepuss!
You're gettin' nothin' out of me!
No.
No, no, no.
It's just It's his birthday.
It's coming up and I Who told you that?
Excuse me?
Booker doesn't celebrate his birthdays.
Booker?
Damn it!
Oh, you're good, Trickypants.
Well, I just want you to know this phone call is now being recorded.
Um, I just need to get some inside information because I wanna surprise him.
Why are you asking me?
Why don't you ask his wife?
Well, I didn't exactly think that was appropriate with them being separated and all.
They're what?
Nothing.
My son is separated?
No I mean, I don't know.
Uh, please don't tell him that you know.
Please don't tell him that I told you.
I really I had no idea.
Can we please just pretend this conversation never happened?
Hello?
Lassiter.
Mother?
What?
What do you mean you want your wedding ring back?
What are you doing?
I'm playing online poker, Shawn.
I know I knew that name, DumbLuck2.
I've played Brandon before, right here, and I beat him.
I figured I'd hang out, see if he logs on.
Hmm.
Looks like a full house, huh?
How did you know that?
You went I don't do that, Shawn.
I didn't do that!
Two pair.
I'd call.
And raise.
You're sitting on pocket rockets.
You're not gonna do any better than that.
Seriously, how do you do that?
It's a good thing you're not a real poker player, Gus.
You'd lose more money than Brandon.
I'm a stellar player, Shawn.
And don't think Wait a second.
What?
He's on now!
Brandon.
Great!
Bring him in.
Bring him in how?
Say, "Hey, Brandon, your dad's looking for you"?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second here, time out.
What?
You're "BigKitty75"?
Yeah, as in the kitty, you know, the pot.
The kitty?
Yes, 75.
came before you?
Yeah, Shawn, there were 74 of 'em.
All right.
All right.
Does Kitty have a profile?
It's Big Kitty, and no, I don't!
Perfect.
Scoot over.
Give me some room to operate here.
What are you doing?
Baiting the hook, Gus.
Baiting the hook?
How?
You can't do this, Shawn!
This is my account!
Shh, relax.
Don't you tell me to You don't have a profile.
They don't know if "Big Kitty" is a man or I'm a man!
The players I play poker with, chat with, know that I'm a man, Shawn!
That's funny, 'cause it appears Brandon thinks that you're a A cheerleader?
"Where does a girl go around here for fun and games"?
Stop it, Shawn!
Get the Relax!
I can't transfer my bank!
I have 7 million bucks!
Oh!
Oh, what's my name?
Oh, I don't know.
Shawn BigKitty75.
Shawn You know, Kitty?
The Kitty Kitty-Cat?
Feline!
Ah!
Felicia.
"Felicia Fancybottom"?
What am I, a James Bond villain?
Look, he's inviting us into a private chat.
Don't do it, Shawn.
I'm telling you, don't do it!
Buy me a drink?
I think that question's for you, Felicia.
Where?
I don't know.
I- I can't Dude, where do you go to hook up with dudes you meet online?
That's not funny, Shawn.
Coffee with Attitude Coffeehouse?
Bring a flower?
What do you think?
Poinsettia?
That's a plant, not a flower.
And it's out of season.
Perfect.
We'll see just how badly he wants to impress Big Felicia Fancybottom.
Ah!
He's punctual.
I like that in a date.
Whoa, guys, I'm expecting somebody, actually.
We know.
Felicia.
Yeah, how do you know Huh.
She's not comin', is she?
He's Felicia.
And I'm Felicia.
Great!
Yeah, I knew it.
All hot internet women are guys!
Of course, you're two guys, which makes it doubly weird.
Sorry, Brandon, but your Dad's lookin' for you.
That's the rub.
He hired us.
Oh, yeah?
Well, the joke's on you 'cause I'm outta here.
Hey, we just wanna talk.
What's goin' on?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You, uh, you know these guys?
Hey, relax.
Brandon and I are friends.
I just wanna talk to him for a minute.
So how's it goin', you good?
Yeah.
Hey!
Whoa!
It's just so you don't forget.
You have until Monday.
Oh!
You were saying?
Well, it looks like your dad's not the only one who's lookin' for ya, huh?
All right, look.
You guys gotta give me a break, okay?
I stole $30,000 dollars from my dad and then I lost it, and more, to that jerk, J.P. Berger.
So I can't go home, not until I win enough to pay everybody back.
What'd he say, you've got till Monday?
Yeah, he did, but see, the thing is, I'm a better player than he is.
I am much better.
And yet he bent you over his knee and spanked you in front of the whole class.
But he shouldn't have!
I just I just gotta figure out how he did it.
Look, Brandon, it's simple.
You go to your dad and convince him to give you your job back.
And then you figure out a way to pay this Berger back his money.
Yeah, that sounds really great.
But, guys, I can't go back to work for my dad.
Nothing I do is ever good enough for that man, nothing is right.
You have no idea what that's like.
Look, here's some brutal truth.
We're the only reasons you're not in jail, or worse.
Your dad's done.
It took someone cashing in a very old favor to get us involved at all.
Now, you are not gonna be able to play your way out of this hole, baby boy!
So pack it in!
Pull the plug!
Shut it down!
Leave the dead meat in the freezer and put on your Sunday best, 'cause it's Arbor Day, baby!
Okay.
Fair enough.
Let's get this over with.
Take me to my father.
What'd I tell ya?
Morning till night, the old man never stops selling.
Want some advice?
Yeah, sure.
When you owe a man $30,000 dollars, I'd be careful about criticizing his work ethic.
That's a good point.
You want us to come with you?
No.
No, you know what?
I screwed up on my own, I am gonna face him on my own.
That's very Cameron Frye of you.
It's Cameron who?
Wow, are we that much older than you?
What's that?
That's nothin'.
It's a good luck charm.
I mean, used to be.
But you know what?
Here.
I don't need it.
I've given up cards, I got no use for it.
Whoa!
No, thanks.
Not really a jewelry guy.
Gus here is.
No, I'm not.
Sure you are.
Right.
Phew!
Let's get this over with, right?
You tryin' to pass that thing off to me?
You liked it.
You like the sweet turquoise.
So you're telling me that you've been working with him for 15 years, but you have no idea what kind of food he likes?
He orders separate when we get take-out.
Something about poison.
What are you doing?
Looking.
For what?
A mint.
I'm allergic to mint.
Ah-ha!
What?
Nothing.
I'm just happy.
Now I know you don't like mint.
Well, well.
Don't you look like hell.
I know I look like hell, Dad.
Everyone who gets up at this hour looks like hell.
With the possible exception of Matt Lauer and Diane Lane.
Mr. Peterson, how are you, sir?
Something wrong?
No, no, Shawn, everything is great.
That's why I woke your ass up, had you zip down here so Bill and I could tell you how terrific everything is.
It's Brandon.
Brandon?
Well, he seemed fine when we dropped him off yesterday, maybe a little nervous.
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You found him?
Well, yeah, we did.
When was this?
Yesterday.
I'm sorry, sir, I should have told you.
It was right before closing.
We could clearly see you from Gus' car, and he said he wanted to come in by himself, do this man-to-man, you know, just you and him.
He didn't come in?
You never saw him?
Oh, we saw him, all right.
I got the reunion right here.
You wanna see it?
There he is, there's my boy.
Guess he couldn't face me, so he waited until after I went home.
Not the safe?
He's breaking into your safe?
Breaking in?
No, he didn't have to break in.
He's too smart for that.
He knows the combination!
There you have it.
Not quite the reunion I imagined.
So tell me, psychic, where's my son now?
Something's bothering me, dude.
I'm never wrong!
You're always wrong, what are you talkin' about?
That this kid should be a better poker player, Gus.
That was a pretty good bluff.
Oh, dude, look!
What?
Right there.
That necklace thing.
That's horrible.
He wears his ridiculous good luck charm into battle the way that Superman wears his cape, or Rocky Balboa wears his belt.
I bet you he's on his way back to the maze to take on Berger.
No, Berger's not gonna be at the lawn and garden center.
Not this weekend.
Why not?
There's a tournament goin' on where the winner gets a buy-in to the World Poker Derby.
You know where that is?
Of course I do!
Phew!
Ooh!
Phew!
Ah!
Oh, it's flipping!
Ah, it wants to flip!
Oh, it wants to flop!
Dad!
T.P. Toilet paper No.
Teri Polo.
Shawn T.P. Tee-pee.
Tee-pee with a chimmy Chimmy, chimmy-changa, chimi-changa, Chaka Khan.
Chaka Khan.
Chaka Khan.
Chimi-changa.
Cha-changa?
Cha-changa!
That's it.
You say tomato, I say to-mah-to.
Cha-changa.
The Indian casino?
Cha-ching!
Damn it!
You were right, Henry.
How's that?
Maybe getting the police involved is the only way to get his attention.
May I have that DVD, please?
No.
Excuse me?
Shawn!
Not yet.
Why?
Let's give him another chance.
I'm sensing there's more to this story, sir.
He's actually a pretty good poker player.
I'm getting a very, very strong psychic vibration he's gonna lose big!
Not with my money he's not.
Let's go.
Oh, God.
We're outta here.
No, Dad.
Dad, I can't.
Would you rather I call the police and show them a certain video of you looting my safe?
I know, I'm sorry about all that.
No, Brandon.
Let's go.
No, Dad, Dad, I'm in more trouble here than you think.
I'm already in!
And they don't give refunds here.
Fine.
I'll play.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You?
You know what?
Actually, sir, this is your call.
I work for you.
But keep in mind that I am a psychic and, unlike any of these other players, I come with a money-back guarantee.
What do you think, Henry?
Can he win?
Dad, I don't gamble.
I win.
Yeah.
He can win.
So, what's the deal?
Shawn and Berger drew opposite tables.
The only way for him face Berger is if he beats everyone at his table, makes it to the finals, and wins.
Check.
God, must be rough.
Sorry?
You picked the wrong week to quit smoking, dude.
There's a tournament happening here.
What are you talking about?
What is this about?
Is this about your lady friend, huh?
Your special girl back home?
She doesn't like it?
Look at the cards, guys, huh?
Lot of possibilities on the table right now.
Lot of possibilities.
Fifty thousand.
Midnight oil says no!
No!
Call.
Ay-ay-ay, action.
Action in my fanny pack.
All right, I'll call you both.
You didn't catch your straight, did you?
Hundred thousand.
Fold.
You let me down.
You let me down.
Ronnie!
What?
This can be your time, right here, right now.
You think you can mess with my head, too?
Here's the thing, I'm a psychic.
So if I had to guess, which I don't, I'd say yes.
Yes, I can mess with your head and I can put an entire sandwich in your hair.
Well, you know what?
I'm not playing with a psychic.
It's against the rules.
Against the rules?
No, guys, guys, I checked the rulebook.
I looked in the index under "P".
It mentioned polygamy, pancakes, and pterodactyls.
Who knew pterodactyl started with a "P"?
I bet you did.
You did.
It's not against the rules, Ronnie.
It's cool.
No, it's not cool.
Look at your stack, man.
Everything's here.
Everything's here.
I need you here.
Take a risk, man!
Bluff it up!
I'll raise you two hundred thousand.
You just bluffed to prove to me that you could bluff.
Ronnie I call this move the all in.
Ronnie with the origami.
Oh!
Oh!
Center table showdown, Shawn Spencer and J.P. Berger.
All in.
All in?
All in?
Yeah, but he shouldn't have.
I just gotta figure out how he did it.
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait.
The chips demand we stop the game.
What the hell is going on here?
Shh!
I can't hear them if you're talking, Berger.
What?
Really?
You guys sure about this?
Chips say you're a cheater-cheater pumpkin-eater!
Is that right?
Yeah.
And how do they know that?
We're really supposed to believe that you're psychic or something!
If you were psychic, I wouldn't be cleaning your clock right now.
Cleaning my clock?
What does that mean, Berger?
What, you'd take time out of your day to clean another man's timepiece?
And if so, that would be a bad thing?
No, I would be gracious.
I would say, "J.P., dude, "thanks for spritzing my watch.
" Besides, it doesn't matter.
Doesn't take a psychic to figure out that these cards are marked.
You know what, if you had been paying attention, you'd realize that the decks were all sealed.
Shh!
He's saying the decks are sealed.
What do you got for me?
Well, come on, guys, speed it up!
Check the Oh!
For shame!
You dirty filthy rascal with the suede-suede head.
Ah-ha!
Face card.
Face card.
Well, how's that possible?
These are brand-new decks.
We got spotters on every table.
But you didn't check your dealers!
Okay, I'm on the dealer.
What do you got for me?
Hair clip?
Hair clip!
Of course.
You!
You stand up!
I'm sorry, ah Wait, let me Hold on!
This Oh, my, there's some kind of invisible ink on this hair clip, and every time she fussed with her ponytail, and I think we can all agree it's a fetching tail, it's a silky tail, she got the ink on her fingers and then she put her fingers on the cards!
And then her special partner with his special rose-colored glasses could see that everything is turning up faces.
All right.
We're not partners.
Put a hold on all these chips here.
This is ridiculous!
Take these two into custody until we sort this out.
This is ridiculous!
You're ridiculous!
For shame!
That is so much money.
I'll, uh, I'll let you guys make it right.
Well, now I know why I always lost to Berger.
It wasn't me.
But, um, it was me stealin' from you and lying to you, and, Dad, for that, I really am sorry.
Well, I appreciate the apology, Son.
But you're gonna have to do a lot more than that to earn my trust back.
Thank you.
No, thank, thank you, Mr. Peterson!
No, thank you.
No, seriously, thank you.
Shut up!
Okay.
Dude!
$7,500?
Peterson is a generous man.
This is our most profitable case ever!
I know, I got plans!
Pay off the flat screen, consolidate our loans, and pay off the bulk in a lump sum!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ooh!
Or What We double up, right here, right now.
What?
Come on, Gus, think about it, seriously, fifteen large?
What are you talkin' about, Shawn?
We could go to Aruba.
Shawn Cozumel.
Shawn!
Ibeeza.
It's Ibiza!
Dude, we could rent a jet to Ibiza.
Don't even think about it!
Rule number one of gambling, do not think.
That's not a rule, Shawn!
Rule number two, always bet on black.
Money plays.
Whoa, but Isn't that right, Steve?
I can't believe you did that!
Look, I told you that's why I don't gamble, Gus.
Shut up, Shawn!
What did Wesley say in Passenger He said, "Always bet on black.
" So I did!
Yeah.
Here you go.
They're cold.
Um, Lassiter leads a really different private life.
Yeah I mean, who'd have thought he was into bikes?
I guess.
Hi.
Well, some of these people look really familiar.
Yeah!
I know, to me, too!
But I haven't had a chance to talk to any of them yet.
I see his car!
I see his car!
What?
Oh!
Everybody hide!
Hide!
What the hell?
Surprise!
Whoa!
Whoa!
No, it's okay.
Whoa!
Move it!
Oh!
Oh, my gosh, no, no, no!
No, no, no, Carlton!
Hey!
It's a party, it's a party!
It's what?
For your birthday!
Surprise!
Why are these people at my house?
They're your friends.
No, they're not.
Yeah, they are!
I got 'em out of your address book.
You took my book?
Yes, I admit it, I opened your desk.
I didn't want to load you up with a bunch of work people, so I just invited the ones with stars by their names.
These are all people I put in jail.
The stars are repeat offenders.
You keep a little black book of people you've arrested?
Of course I do.
Why?
To drive by and check on them.
Um, um, oh, Carlton, where are you going?
To pack!
Why?
Because now they know where I live!
Happy Birthday, dude!
Happy Birthday!
Nice house!
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?

{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
This is torture.
It's not torture, Shawn, it's a 10 minute ride to the police station.
But I wanna eat my candy.
Not until I have it X-Rayed.
Well, can I eat my candy?
Knock yourself out, Lando.
As long as your old man doesn't mind his nine year-old son passing razor blades.
Officer, please!
We've got a jumper.
Hey, hey, back off, I got kids in here.
Phone lines are down, we tried the police already.
There's no time.
She's really gonna jump.
Okay, okay, look, look, I'll radio for backup.
I not gonna subject these boys to Dad, you have to help.
Sonofa Now listen to me boys, I do not want you to leave this vehicle.
Do you understand?
I want you to stay put until I get back.
Don't look, don't listen.
Just shut your eyes.
And keep them shut.
I'll be right back.
She's straight up the stairs.
Room 413!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Not even sort of.
Gus You'll thank me later.
Doreen!
Doreen.
Doreen!
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know Theyjust don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end You cheated.
I did not cheat.
You're not using the side walls at all.
I don't need your tips, Shawn.
I've beaten you before.
Yeah.
When we were 12.
And I had pinkeye.
Immaterial.
The low game was crackling.
The worm burner was in full effect.
Okay, you cannot have a shot called the worm burner.
Why not?
Because it's my strikeout pitch in Wiffle ball.
Pick a different name.
Excuse us, may we help you?
Hey, guys.
Damn, girl.
Yeah, I know.
Get it all out now.
I barely recognize myself.
But isn't it kind of amazing?
Mary Lou Baumgartner.
National Alumni Vice Parliamentarian.
Beta Kappa Theta Sorority.
Guys.
I'm undercover.
Deep.
We should totally celebrate.
It's crazy.
I have spent the entire morning planning a mixer!
And yesterday, I went and I had a Himalayan mani-pedi.
Yeah, at first it was just to get the other girls to talk, but then I realized my cuticles have been completely taken for granted.
Jules, you realize that we are the only ones that can see or hear you.
Yeah, okay, I admit.
I've been undercover a week now, and it's really hard to get out of this mindset.
These girls, they are demons.
They are vicious little prairie dogs with trust funds and collagen parties.
It's a lot to juggle and I need a favor.
Okay.
I've been at the university investigating the death of a coed, Doreen Harthan.
The girl they found at Wispy Sunny Pines.
Wasn't that a suicide?
Allegedly.
A copycat job.
I guess Santa Barbara has some sort of urban legend about a mental patient who jumped from room 413.
Scary Sherry.
We know that one.
Yeah, well, I'm not so sure about the suicide angle and Interim ChiefVick is putting a tremendous amount of faith in me to crack this thing and I need to build a case.
So I'm here, but I'm not.
Get it?
Gus, what's the word?
That'd be mum.
Doreen was pledging a sorority.
And I, or, Mary Lou, am helping my sisters through this very difficult time.
I'm convinced they know more than they're letting on.
I need a psychic to read the sorority house.
Can you come by tonight?
Can we wear pajamas?
No.
Even better.
Guys, this is serious, there's some really weird stuff that's been going on.
The girls are petrified, they think they're being haunted.
By what?
Oh, come on, Jules.
You know we're gonna come man up.
Just tell us.
Doreen Harthan's lumbering ghost.
Lumbering?
Seems completely logical to me.
Meet me at the house at 7:00.
And remember, I was never here.
Quick question.
Where's Lassiter for all of this?
Temporary re-assignment.
Bye.
Excuse me, I'm gonna have to ask you to vacate this room.
Excuse me, I'm gonna have to ask you to go screw yourself.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, don't beg.
Look, there's gonna be a private meeting in this room between myself and a new detective from a new department.
Well, then I must be in the right place.
No, Ma'am, I'm looking for a rookie.
What the hell does that mean?
You know, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, roots matching the rest of the hair.
I'm a detective.
Goochberg.
Gooch to people I respect.
And those few lucky enough to have seen me naked.
Guess which one you should use?
God, the first one?
I'm sorry, how can you possibly be a rookie at your, you know, advanced age?
I passed the test Friday.
I had to sue the department to let me take it again.
Again?
I might have failed it.
A few times.
Thirteen to be exact.
But that's the first thing you're gonna learn about me, scarecrow, the word "quit" is not in my vocabulary.
Where do you go to shoot guns around here?
I see a man.
He's driving your car.
You don't know him.
He's a valet.
And a mall.
Wait, I see a shoe store.
Your father's gold card.
A Jamba Juice may have been involved?
Oh, my God.
I totally went shopping today.
I passed by a Jamba on State Street.
You are amazing.
See, Bianca?
Now tell Shawn what happened to you last night.
Okay, here goes.
This is so scary.
I was lying in bed, watching One Tree Hill, my favorite show, Chad Michael Murray is so hot.
And I have this cute liquid kitty alarm clock, right?
It meows and it blinks its eyes every half hour.
So, all of a sudden, they just started blinking over and over and over and then it just stopped.
And then, it let out this half-meow.
And then its tail fell off.
Then it exploded.
Wow.
Slow build.
Half meow, unexpected.
Didn't see the end coming at all.
How about you, Gus?
What?
No, I can't say I did.
Anybody else?
Okay, so basically it's a lot of really weird stuff that's creepy and happens at night.
Mr. Spencer is it?
Yes, that's correct Mrs Baumgartner.
Now, what I'm going to need from you, is an article of clothing.
Preferably an undergarment.
Don't you usually get that from the victim?
I've seen it both ways.
I'm gonna have to take a look around to see what I feel.
Starting with the bedrooms.
Of course.
I'll show you upstairs.
Ask him.
You ask him.
What?
What do you wanna ask me, girls?
Don't be nervous.
I put my pants on one leg at a time, just like you.
Okay.
Did you really play Bud on The Cosby Show?
Bud?
Who told you that?
I knew I recognized you!
Wait, wait I'm not Oh, come-on, don't be modest, Gus.
You are totally Bud!
Shawn, you believe this?
No, no, no, I didn't catch anything, Bud.
Stop telling people that my name is Bud.
Get out!
Ackenaib!
Ackenaib!
Ackenaib!
Shawn!
Where are you going!
My partner and I just need to confer in private.
Compare notes and what not.
Okay.
The girls are sleeping over at the Omega Muse.
Well, they can come home tomorrow, I found the evil spirit, it's Radio Shack.
The face at the window, the old flood light on the roof trick.
That's how they do it at Haunted Mansion.
Don't ask me how I know that.
These girls are awful.
The suspect list is essentially the entire student registry.
Although Although what?
Alice Bundy.
Doreen's best friend, her roommate.
Thought you said she lived at home.
The Harthan's took Alice in.
She's the only one that I haven't talked to, but conventional wisdom would say, she has a score to settle.
Holy Shitzu!
Excuse me?
This new polish is already starting to chip!
You know, you might actually hit the target more if you bothered to blink in between rounds.
And of course your concentration level might get a little boost if you bothered to wear protective ear and eyewear.
That wouldn't do any good, I'm totally deaf in this ear.
It was in a bar room fight with a teamster.
She had a waffle iron.
But see, that's not the problem.
The problem is this pea-shooter.
This pea-shooter they issued me.
I need a real gun.
I need something like this.
Let me see this.
No!
Oh, see now, this is a gun.
No, you see, that's an enormously powerful handgun.
You're not bracing yourself for the kickback.
Don't tell me my business, kid.
Trust me, you won't even recognize yourself.
Which is a really good thing.
It will be fun, and you can help save the endangered tamarind monkeys.
Bianca, you have like twice as many flyers as me and Mary Lou.
What's going on with you?
Are you like pregnant or something?
Can you shut up for like five seconds, Betty?
Oh, my God, you are being such a horrid little bitch right now.
How can you just Aren't you scared?
I haven't slept at all, I feel like I'm losing Suck it up.
End of story.
I will not go down with you, Bianca.
Alice Bundy?
Hi.
I'm Mary Lou Baumgartner.
Beta Kappa Theta West Coast Alumni Save it, I already hate you.
Vice Parliamentarian.
Oh.
Well.
I know you were Doreen's best friend and I just wanted to introduce myself and tell you that if there's anything that I or Beta Kappa Theta can do for you during this very difficult time, please don't hesitate to ask.
How does it feel being Queen of the Damned?
Alice, I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
Just stay away from me.
Fair warning.
Ew!
Hair.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
I'm riding in the back.
No, you're not.
I'm not gonna take a stray bullet for you, scarecrow.
Look, even if I wanted to sit in the front, it's not gonna happen.
My eyes can't take that kind of direct sunlight.
My rods and cones are all out of whack.
I took a crowbar to an eye socket during a sangria party gone wrong.
Long story short, I've got early onset retinitis pigmentosa.
Hey buddy, good news.
I just got a fax confirming that the city of Santa Barbara has unanimously voted you Exorcist of the year.
Okay, make all your little jokes.
But I know who's right on my ass all the way to the car.
I had no choice.
You were my ride home.
Shawn, you were screaming too.
Yes, I was screaming, "Gus, stop, let's be brave.
" Look, both the parents and the best friend were adamant that Doreen had too much to live for to kill herself.
Plus, she was pledging a sorority.
Right.
Now, take another look at this.
The latch is broken.
And she fell backwards.
Scary Sherry took a swan dive.
Exactly.
Gus, you are on fire.
Thank you.
The copy cat suicide angle literally goes out the window.
What next?
I couldn't find the word "Ackenaib" anywhere.
I checked alternate spellings, all possible roots, nothing in Latin.
So now I'm going through the dead languages by region.
Sanskrit was a wash, as was Avestan.
Up next is Old Church Slavonic, but to be honest I think it's all just nonsensical gibberish.
But it's gotta mean something.
The voice in the house kept repeating it.
Ackenaib.
Ackenaib.
Ackenaib.
What's Juliet's number?
I have a theory.
What's the theory?
Gus, just feed me the digits.
Why do I always have to ask what the damn theory is, Shawn?
Hello?
Is Bianca with you?
Who wants to know?
Jules, where is she?
Okay, tone.
She's back at the house with Betty, running late for the mixer.
Just like me.
All right, listen, I've had a vision.
We need to meet at the sorority house on the fly.
Shawn, I can't.
I have to make the spirit speech and who's gonna fuse the planter's punch?
Oh, yeah, by the way, I met Alice Bundy today.
She's not a shiny happy person.
I think Jules!
Doreen didn't kill herself.
She was not alone in that room.
And we need to talk to Bianca right now!
She's in danger!
Bianca!
What are you doing in there?
We're gonna be totally late for Mary Lou's speech and we're supposed to lead the slow clap.
Just go without me.
You don't have to wait.
Okay.
This is ridiculous.
Just open the door.
I'm coming in there.
I'm not going to the mixer, Betty.
Even if I wanted to, my fingers and toes are all pruney now.
Ew!
Bianca, open the door.
This is completely ridiculous.
Hello?
Mary Lou!
It's Bianca!
Help!
Jules?
Betty, if you know something you have to tell the chief here.
We're all in danger.
Any one of us could be next.
I can sit here all night, Betty.
I've got six month old who still has colic, I consider this a reprieve.
Now, why is your friend Bianca dead?
I can see it.
I can see you running down the hallway at the asylum.
Wait a second.
Doreen wasn't supposed to die.
This was an accident.
The wood was rotten and the latch broke!
Yes, yes!
It broke!
Don't you see we never meant for her to fall.
It was a complete accident!
Oh, my God, Bianca, what the hell did you do?
Please, do continue.
It was my job to get Doreen into the house.
She knew that it was a haze.
She thought that she was supposed to spend the whole night inside.
Like that movie with the hedge maze and Vincent Van Patten?
Hell Night.
Exactly.
Bianca was inside wearing this nightgown, you know, like Scary Sherry, the girl who jumped from We know.
Nightgown.
Nightgown.
I'm feeling the nightgown.
Put it in.
Bianca buried it in the tar pits three nights ago.
Tar pits?
I know.
It was really gross and sticky.
But, she was just scared.
We both were.
Look, it was an accident, I swear to God.
Bianca tried to grab her arm but it was too late.
Nobody was supposed to die.
Now Bianca's gone, too.
You withheld evidence.
And by conspiring with Bianca we can charge you with involuntary manslaughter.
You understand that's a crime?
I know!
No!
You actually slept here last night?
Yes, I did, it's called crunch time.
Have you checked the messages?
Have we heard from Juliet?
Yeah.
Alice Bundy's alibi is airtight.
She lives with Doreen's family.
Said she went upstairs to bed early that night and the parents confirmed it, they were still downstairs awake when the police called.
Who the hell's doing this?
Oh.
And your dad called.
What could he possibly want?
Said he wanted to remind you about dinner tonight.
You're supposed to bring dessert.
He actually seemed sort of excited.
Oh, God, that's tonight.
Dude, you have to come.
Oh, I don't know about that, Shawn.
It seems like a pretty big deal, him reaching out and all.
I wouldn't want to intrude.
Gus, he loves you.
He always has.
Plus, if you come we can roll earlier.
We'll say we're working on a case.
We are working on a case.
Sweet.
So, it's settled.
What are you doing?
I have to start and ultimately finish my route.
Awesome.
I'm going to find Alice "best friend" Bundy.
Don't you think that girl has been through enough, Shawn?
Gus, there is no such thing as an air tight alibi.
And if there is, we're going to pretend like there isn't.
This girl is Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct.
Which makes me Michael Douglas and you George Dzundza.
Who's name is actually Gus in the film.
Until we have another lead, we assume it's her.
We've just got to figure out the "how.
" So far, no ice pick.
First of all, don't ever compare my black ass to George Dzundza again, okay?
Fair.
And what can you possibly ask that girl that the police already haven't?
Wanna split a pineapple?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
My name is Ichibod Fletchman.
Sticky Icky to my boys.
But that's neither here nor there.
What's important is that this baby is Are you a crazy person?
It's funny I was about to ask you the same thing.
Only I was going to add "who likes to make toast" to the end of mine.
Great.
So you're another cop then?
Not a cop.
Not even close.
Then who are you?
Hint.
Green Day there is about to eat some stone.
How did you do that?
I'm a psychic.
Pass.
Oh, come on.
I was trying to be cool.
What do you want from me?
You want to read my palm?
You want a lock of hair?
Alice.
I can feel that you're hurting.
Really?
Can you feel that I'm hurting?
Come on, psychic, you can do better than that.
Can't you?
Do you have a best friend?
I do.
Since birth, almost.
Great.
Then maybe you can wrap your head around this.
Doreen and I were closer than sisters.
Her parents took me in when I was seven.
Seven.
They raised me.
We did everything together.
The one time I wasn't there, the one time I let her down, and now she's gone.
I know that if anything ever happened to Gus I would I don't know.
Look, do you really think I killed that girl?
Do you?
I understand your suspicion, but I'm barely hanging on here, and I just don't think that I'm not a murderer.
Well, I certainly hope not for your sake.
Someone came in and emptied the cash register when I was in the back.
You're not writing this down?
Who's got the arthritic thumb here?
I hitchhiked from Jersey to Havana when I was 19.
They also got away with about $60 worth of rump roast.
Don't try to sell me on that nonsense, you punk.
What?
You think this is my first square dance?
Give me your gun, Lassiter.
I'll show you how to make this little pig squeal.
You just gonna let him go?
He's the victim, Goochberg!
Fine.
Fine.
I'll do it myself.
Mary Lou, wait!
I totally almost forgot to give this to you.
What is it, Eden?
I don't know.
It was left on the stoop like a little baby orphan.
"God's gift is forgiveness.
"Please join us in remembering our daughter.
"Your attendance would be greatly appreciated.
" Tonight?
Hello!
Plans.
Bye.
Bye.
Boy, we really should be going.
Come on, guys.
Shawn, stay.
Your case will still be there.
The sooner we can crack this case and move on the better.
Believe me.
This wouldn't have anything to do with the Wispy Sunny Pines suicide now, would it?
No.
Yes, sir.
Ooh, the plot thickens.
Okay.
It's true, fine.
And it hits a little close to home seeing as how we were there the first time it happened.
First time what happened?
Did you open your eyes?
Dad, you've known me my whole life.
Of course, I opened my eyes.
Shawn, that is why I used to refuse to let you ride around with me.
Dad, let it go, I was nine.
It's a lack of respect.
Of protocol.
Of protocol?
Again, can I plead nine years old?
And you guys have been freaked out about this your entire lives?
I don't even drive by that place.
I really don't think it's funny.
It was a very scary thing for two young boys.
It certainly puts a new spin on the nanny in The Omen.
You know that's right.
Shawn, how much did you see?
I didn't exactly see it.
Luckily, he missed the bitter, grisly end.
Luckily?
Yes, luckily.
I covered his eyes but we know what happened.
Oh, I beg to differ.
It seems you two missed one very small but important detail.
She never jumped.
What?
No.
No, that's impossible.
We saw the window, she was gone.
Yeah.
Because one off-duty police officer pulled her back inside.
Scary Sherry Craddock was rehabilitated.
I'm pretty sure she's married and lives in Fresno.
Come on, guys, give me some credit.
I have no idea how that ridiculous urban legend got started in the first place.
Your big ass mouth.
I wanted to keep it a secret.
You're the one who was broadcasting it at the lunch table.
I can't believe this.
We actually started an urban legend.
That's dope.
Sometimes, Shawn, the answer is right in front of your eyes.
You just need to choose to see it.
That was creepy.
This is it.
Alice's house.
I know there's something here, I just got to find it.
Here's the plan.
You ring the doorbell and distract who Who Whom Who The person.
The person that answers the door.
I go around back and look for a way in.
Are you kidding?
It took you the whole ride to come up with that?
Feel free to make revisions.
How am I supposed to distract them?
You'll think of something.
Good luck.
We're all counting on you.
Mrs. Harthan?
No.
The Harthans are down at the cemetery.
I'm Poppy, the housekeeper.
May I help you?
Yes.
Have you seen Mrs. Pickles?
Mrs. Pickles?
Mrs. Pickles.
My Orange Tabby!
You must have seen her before.
She's pregnant with who knows how many unborn Tabby kittens and I've lost her.
You know that growing up in Edinburgh, my sisters and I had a basset hound who used to hoot like a snowy owl.
No kidding.
What was his name?
We called him Basset Hound.
Although my sister, she always used called him Uncle Jimmy.
I never knew why.
Mrs. Pickles!
Here.
Your Mrs. Pickles will come back to you, D'Andre.
Doreen and I were closer than sisters.
What in heaven's that?
I've got to set this thing on vibrate.
I'm sorry, who is this?
Shawn, it's Eden!
Who?
From Beta Kappa Theta.
Are you coming to our party or what the heck?
There are cops here and everything.
Let me talk to Mary Lou.
Mary Lou had to go to some candlelight vigil thingy for Doreen.
Vigil?
What vigil?
There Yeah, at that creepy Wispy Sunny Pines' place.
Bianca buried it at the tar pits three nights ago.
What about Bud?
Can he come?
Has anyone ever told you that you look like little Bud from the old Cosby Show?
Yes, ma'am.
But I was not Bud.
Hello?
You bet.
It's her.
Who?
Mrs. Pickles.
She's home.
I believe it was It was her.
And I've got the how.
We have to go to Wispy Sunny Pines.
What?
No, no.
You said go to the sorority house.
The girls are fine.
The cops are there.
Meanwhile, Juliet's at some candlelight vigil with Doreen's family at the asylum.
Wait.
No, no.
The housekeeper said Doreen's parents were at the cemetery.
What?
What?
Oh, God!
Of course.
Why mess around with the worker bees when you can kill the queen?
What are you talking about, Shawn?
Gus, Alice.
She wanted us all at that party, including us, so that she could get Mary Lou by herself.
This is Silence of the Lambs!
Which means we're both Scott Glen.
Okay, Shawn, listen to me.
If I'm gonna go back to that creepy ass institution that I've been afraid to drive by since I was nine, there are going to be some rules and regulations.
Gus, this is no time for Listen, Shawn.
I will not enter a room first.
I will not enter a room last.
I will not investigate any suspicious noises or go looking for a fuse box.
And you will not, under any circumstances, leave me by myself without a weapon of some sort.
Do you understand and agree to my terms?
I'm not prepared to negotiate.
Do you understand, Shawn?
Yes!
I do!
Yes!
All right.
Let's go help Juliet.
Scarecrow, did we get him?
No.
No.
Of course, we didn't get him.
Your little pursuit sort of ended when you had a mild cardiac arrest.
When were you gonna tell me about the pacemaker?
And how dare you try and scale a fence in high heels?
He was the victim, Goochberg.
But did we get him?
Yeah.
Yeah, we got him, Goochberg.
Lassiter.
Spencer?
You realize you are the second last human person on this planet I want to be speaking to right now.
Call for backup, O'Hara.
Just make the call.
Better safe than sorry.
Mary Lou.
We're over here.
I have to say I'm a little shocked to see you here.
Where's everyone else?
Upstairs.
They're waiting for you.
I told them you probably wouldn't show.
Maybe you misjudged me.
Maybe I did.
Follow me.
Wow!
This must have taken hours.
I mean, this is really extensive, candle-wise.
The whole family is waiting in room 413.
Okay.
Alice, what the hell is this?
Welcome to the party, Mary Lou.
It's a banquet fit for a queen!
Alice, you do not wanna do this.
Give me the axe.
I'm not who you think I am.
No.
You're exactly who I think you are.
You're the reason girls vomit and starve themselves to death.
And you're the reason that they fill themselves with plastic.
And you are the reason that Doreen is dead.
And so now, on behalf of the entire suit of the broken hearts, Alice will now lop off the Queen's head.
That just sounded so much better out loud than it did in my head.
Lassie, our timing is really starting to crackle.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
We made a deal, Shawn!
Thank you.
Get it out!
Get it out!
Pull your foot out of the shoe!
I can't!
It's too tight!
Don't leave me, Shawn!
That was rule number five!
Loosen your big toe?
I can't move my big toe.
What?
Work the laces!
Shawn, Shawn!
Shawn!
O' Hara!
Juliet!
That is it!
Nowyou die for sure!
I don't think so.
You are under arrest, you crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy bitch!
Detective!
Juliet!
Hey.
I got it.
I got it.
What in the hell happened in there?
She's crazy!
Look, she's possessed.
You have to believe me.
O'Hara?
You're asking me?
I though I was coming to a candlelight vigil.
I thought I was coming to pay my condolences.
Apparently that wasn't the case.
Ow!
Give me that.
What would you have done, Shawn?
If it was your best friend?
What would you have done?
Oh, no.
Gus.
Shawn, come get me out of here!
This is not funny, Shawn!
Did I upset you?
Upset me?
Insult you?
Demean you in some way that I did not comprehend?
Detective, I am pretty sure I have no idea what you are talking about.
The woman.
The crazy woman.
The half-deaf litigating nightmare express of a detective.
Why would you put me, of all people, with her?
I'm head detective.
Honestly, detective, I thought you two might hit it off.
Why would you possibly think that?
She kinda reminded me a little of you.
You know, a few years down the road.
Similar interests.
Outlooks.
Everyone thought it was a good idea.
That's how people perceive me?
We're all surprised it didn't work out, Carlton.
You sick mother Dude, we could hear you from the fourth floor.
Don't lie!
Don't lie!
Hey, Lassie.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
