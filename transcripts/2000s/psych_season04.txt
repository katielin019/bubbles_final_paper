{START OF EPISODE 1}
That was your teacher.
Apparently, you were the only one who didn't turn in his art assignment.
So there's going to be an empty space on the wall at open house tonight.
Actually, dad, I'm pretty sure I did finish it.
It sounds to me like it was stolen.
So somebody breaks into the school, and the only thing they steal is your painting?
Why's that?
Because it's the perfect crime.
Sit.
Shawn, there is no such thing as a perfect crime.
We leave in 45 minutes.
Make something pretty.
Is your hair starting its own cult?
Trying to do a performance review here.
I thank you not to bother us.
That seems like a strange thing to thank me for, but you're welcome, of course.
And now, as a show of gratitude, how about a little advance on our next case?
You're not an actual employee of the police department.
Define "actual", wait, define "police", wait I'm not giving you an advance on a case that may or may not happen in the future.
Perhaps I know something you don't.
Let's be honest.
It's not like crime is going to suddenly stop, is it, Gus?
Seems very unlikely.
- Out.
- So that's a no on the advance.
Pardon me for asking the obvious question, but how are you out of money?
You have no possessions and no expenses.
- That's mostly true.
- That's completely true.
But Gus and I also have a big ski vacation planned.
Ski vacation?
Mr. Spencer, it's the middle of summer.
Where are you gonna find snow at this time of year?
- Are we ever gonna start skiing?
- Soon as I finish this hot chocolate.
- Why don't you just throw it out?
- I would, but this hot cocoa represents the end of our vacation money.
How are we out of cash?
We've only been here four hours.
The American dollar was not as strong as I anticipated, Gus.
Which is why I had to put the whole thing on a credit card.
You don't have a credit card.
I said a credit card, not my credit card.
It's your card.
That's why I'm being so aggressive about getting the money to pay you back.
See that?
A month ago I would've had us styled up with those girls tonight.
- What?
- But I'm spoken for now.
I have Abigail, and she has me.
You have been talking about her this whole time.
- Why didn't you bring her on this trip?
- Gus, you are my best friend.
Because I've entered into some newfangled relationship does not mean that our guy time goes by the wayside.
You know, if you're gonna keep staring at girls, you can't preach about how committed you are to Abigail.
All right, first of all, the person I'm staring at is a man.
He's handsome dimples, brooding eyebrows But a man nonetheless, and I know that guy.
You don't know that guy.
I think he's wearing $10,000 skis.
- All you own is that hot chocolate.
- I've seen this guy before.
I can't place where.
Well, I can play too!
I need you to like me.
He arrested Ernesto Ramon Chavez.
Dude.
You remember when we were in Lassie's apartment - and we saw his wall of suspects?
- When Lassiter killed that guy?
He didn't.
We got him exonerated.
I got punched and pistol-whipped.
I'm still not sure he didn't kill that guy.
What does the name Pierre "Des per-ea-eux mean to you?
Are you in my apartment?
I haven't snuck into your apartment in weeks.
We're all out of peanut butter.
Whatever you're up to, just stop.
No need for a psychic with an art thief.
- He's an art thief?
- No way.
A dangerous art thief, right?
Never been caught, never left enough evidence to be accused.
Cut to the chase.
What kind of reward have we for catching this guy?
- Or an advance for catching him.
- Or a finder's fee.
- I'm looking right at him.
- You don't do anything.
You have no jurisdiction up there.
You have no jurisdiction anywhere, especially in Canada.
- You're not thinking the thing through.
- You're right.
With the exchange rates.
- We won't get the check right away.
- Ask about taxes.
Listen.
Despereaux is mine.
I absolutely forbid you to do anything.
Sorry, too late.
It's time for us to catch a thief.
So what do we do now?
Do we call the authorities?
We make sure it's Despereaux.
And I have an ingenious plan to smoke him out.
Sounds good.
- That was your plan?
- Let's go!
Turn, turn, turn!
I think we should've taken that second ski lesson.
We're doing great!
Remember what the instructor said.
Pizza slices to slow down.
French fries to speed up.
We got him.
There's only one move we can't follow.
What's that?
He just made it.
- The slow, gentle turn?
- That was it.
You know what this means.
That we suck at skiing?
It means that this hot chocolate just became a write-off.
Psych 401 "Extradition British Columbia" Timing: Psych Team What did this fellow's name was again?
Pierre Despereaux.
It's 11 "o"s, I believe.
Pierre Despereaux.
E-a-u-x.
Thefts in London, Belgium, Switzerland, South Africa.
Where'd you came across him again?
Ultimately we cornered him at a resort up in Whistler, but first, I sensed his presence here in your country.
I don't follow.
Just one second, please.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Have a little faith.
I've done it once.
I can do it again.
- We are in a foreign land.
- Not really.
- We went through immigration.
- Why you gotta question everything Here's the thing, Robert.
The thing is this.
I am a psychic.
We work for the Santa Barbara police department.
We've solved over 47 cases.
I'm also a pharmaceutical rep, if that means anything to you.
- You've seen The mentalist, right?
- Yes.
- It's like that.
- Except that guy's a fake.
If I was a fake psychic, it would be eerily similar.
- Exactly the same.
- A virtual carbon copy.
Okay, well, now, Mr. Spencer, you seem like a nice enough guy, but you should know that there are many here at the R.C.M.P.
that would be a little more skeptical of these alternative methods than you're probably used to in the States.
- What's he doing?
- He's having a psychic episode.
- It's a bit off-putting.
- You get used to it.
Hey, biking to work.
I like it.
It's great for the environment.
I live a kilometer away, but, yeah, actually.
It's cleaner.
Hey, you.
How's the little guy?
Is he walking yet?
Barely.
He just turned one.
Do I know you?
Robert, give me your mitts.
I'm sensing that you have a lot of really good ideas, but that nobody around here seems to want to listen.
Stay the course, buddy.
You'll have your day.
I'm getting Ed.
I am getting Ed.
You gotta be more careful, Shawn.
This boss comes out, it's make or break.
No more wild guesses.
Get your socks ready, Gus, 'cause I'm about to knock them off.
What you got?
- I got nothing.
You?
- Nothing.
- I got it.
- No, you don't.
- Yes.
- It's obvious - Don't tell me, don't tell me.
- Shut up!
So, you work as a psych You wouldn't by chance be celebrating a birthday anniversary any time soon, would you?
- You kidding me?
- Yes.
That's amazing.
My birthday's today.
How'd you know that?
It's all right here.
Hello there, constable.
This is deputy commissioner Ed Dykstra with the Vancouver R.C.M.P.
office, and I'm here with a couple fellas you work for, and they have some psychic information about a Pierre Despereaux.
- You familiar with him?
- Familiar?
I've been tracking that man for 6 years.
I'm the closest anyone's ever gotten to catching him.
That's terrific.
If you could just send up those files, detective Spencer and I would be much obliged.
Detective?
Are you kidding me?
Despereaux is not to be messed with.
Check with Interpol.
He's cunning and dangerous.
And if he is up there, you will need my expertise on this.
I know all his patterns.
I want to be made a full partner on this.
I think that's something you better run by your superior here.
- I don't want - Hey there, buddy.
Spencer, you listen to me, and you listen good.
You do not touch Despereaux.
Wait for me.
I'll be on the next flight.
I sure would love to see you too, but don't you think you should focus on your case load?
I don't think the chief's going to approve this.
I have 325 days of unused vacation time.
I will see you in five hours.
Chief, little favor to ask.
Do you believe that?
A high-ranking member of the U.S. law enforcement not being allowed to carry his weapon on him?
Did you really think it wouldn't set off the metal detector?
I've got to get my hands on a gun.
I have enemies everywhere.
- Maybe I can pick one up at the hotel.
- Absolutely.
Right downstairs in the gift shop.
They have kleenex, mixed nuts, and 9-millimeter lugers.
- Thanks for letting me use your miles.
- Thanks for bringing me along.
Otherwise, you wouldn't let me use your miles.
It was really sweet.
What?
See taxi to False Creek.
We're not here on a sightseeing mission.
We are here on official business!
Got you.
It is business.
Looks like Despereaux already made his first strike.
It's a crime scene.
Can I help you?
Listen, Dudley, I'm detective Lassiter and this is my partner, O'Hara.
We're from the SPBD.
You work for Mr. Shawn Spencer.
Sorry.
So sorry.
I've been instructed not to let anyone in without checking with head detective Spencer first.
- This is a joke, right?
- Brace yourself, guys.
He never steals a single item.
It's always, always multiples.
That's directly from my report Spencer!
Don't interrupt the head detective when he's working.
The ions are specifically concentrated here and here.
Crime ions.
Write that down.
- This is Mr. Lassiter - Detective.
And his partner, Juliet O'Hara.
They are from Santa Barbara.
Welcome aboard.
Glad you made it okay.
You look normal and stuff.
I got nothing.
This is Mr. Stockwell, owner of the necklace in question.
Well, Mr. Stockwell.
May I call you Gibby?
- My first name is Randolph.
- I've heard it both ways.
How's he doing?
- He's been better.
- Let me start by saying, let us not cry over spilled syrup.
Honestly, it's a little silly for a man of your stature to wear a necklace like this.
- What are you talking about?
- The necklace is an authentic Edwardian baroque caliber-cut piece.
It has never touched human skin.
It is worth $3.5 million.
What are we talking?
Canadian dollars?
He stole something else too.
He stole a painting.
Ed, he's better than I thought, I'm afraid.
I sold that painting two weeks ago.
If I may, I'd like to determine whether this was actually the work of Despereaux.
Now, I assume you found no alarms tripped?
- No prints?
- No, none But we did find a burning cigarette in the ashtray over there.
And Mr. Stockwell is not a smoker.
- A merchanteuse blonde?
- Blonde?
Where's the blonde?
I'll need to read her immediately.
It's a blonde filtered cigarette.
Merchanteuse.
It's french.
Despereaux always leaves one burning as his signature.
The only photographic of Despereaux is extremely any chance take of wondering Despereaux always comes in and out of town undetected, with an army of aliases, usually of an artist.
Pardon me!
If everyone would like to join to the roof, the psychic criminal-catching portion of the day is about to begin.
Everyone, please stay where you are.
He does this all the time.
Mildly impressive that you found me here.
You two are making a marked improvement from your harlequinade antics on the slopes.
In my defense, I have two left knees.
You know what's more impressive?
In about 15 seconds, you're gonna see a fierce, albeit gunless, American detective, his striking snow bunny partner, which I mean nothing salacious by, and half the R.C.M.P.
are gonna storm this roof and take you down.
Wait for it I'd love to.
But I really have to go.
Where do you think you're going?
To my room.
Now it's your turn to wait for it.
Clearly, that was more impressive.
I am telling you, he was here.
He was right here.
And he jumped off.
From a handstand!
It wasn't from a handstand, he just - He jumped off normal style.
- He jumped off a 26-story building?
Somebody was just spotted coming out of the service elevator.
We didn't have a man?
Because you asked everyone to come up here.
- You know, because of Shawn.
- It doesn't matter.
It's not him.
We just saw Despereaux leap from this building!
- He was wearing a flying suit.
- We don't know that.
Guys!
Look, I just want you to know that I believe you.
Completely.
Except for the jumping off the building part.
Mackintosh!
We looked like idiots.
Gus, we have to regroup.
And we need to eat.
Shawn, this place seems a little - Exclusive?
- Dark.
Cozy.
Romantic.
A little sexy.
First of all, you say those words like they're bad things.
Secondly, do you know how hard it is to get a reservation at this place?
You have to call, like, a month in advance.
You invited me on this trip on Friday.
- When did you call?
- It's irrelevant.
What matters Dude.
Dude!
There he is.
He's sitting right there.
What do we do?
Do we call the cops?
What if he sees us?
- He sees us.
- How do you know?
- He's waving us over.
- My gosh, he is.
- We shouldn't go over there.
- Right, right.
We found you.
So looks like we win.
I am neither known nor wanted in this country.
At best, I'm a person of interest in the places I do my work.
Such is the curse of my talent.
So since I have taken the time to find you, please, don't spoil it with rudeness.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
You know, I've I've enjoyed our sparring so far.
The look on your faces when I jumped from that building was amusing.
But I'd be remiss if I didn't inform you that you're way out of your league.
The simple fact is, you'll never catch me.
It's impossible.
Which makes what should be an exciting life somewhat pedestrian.
I'll tell you what.
To make this more interesting for me, I'm going to write down everything that I'm going to do.
Sometime tomorrow, I'm going to steal a Manet.
And then I'm going to make you look foolish again.
And then the next day, I'm going to treat myself like a king.
Here's what I'm going to do.
First, I'm gonna get some of that maple candy that everybody seems to be raving about.
Then I'm going to purchase myself a walking stick.
Preferably something with a ram's head carved into the handle.
And finally, we're going to catch ourselves an international art thief.
I'm not saying for sure it's going to be you.
But right now you're at the top of the list.
Are you writing on our cloth napkins?
It's not my fault.
You guys should have some sort of notepad system, like next to pay phones, they have a little pad that you I just don't understand why anyone would want to do that.
Unless you're animals, of course.
Animals?
What is that?
You know what that is?
Where did he go?
He disappeared again?
I believe so.
Unless he's hiding under the table, in which case this conversation would be embarrassing.
No, I'm afraid we fell for the flaming baked Alaska diversion trick again.
So what are we supposed to do?
You gonna pretend like you got the info about the Manet psychically?
Please, Gus.
That's cheap and easy.
Give me some credit.
We don't know why he just handed this information over to us.
We'll do what any reasonable detective would do.
What?
I see a man net.
I see the painter John Manet.
Edouard.
Where in town might one find an - Edouard Manet.
- What he said.
Because I believe that Despereaux is gonna try and steal one tonight.
How clear are you on this?
It's as if he wrote it on a piece of paper and put it in my hand.
You sure this is the only Manet?
There's not a single one at a gallery in town.
I took the initiative of making a book of all the things of value that Despereaux might hit.
I even used my bind-it-all.
Not a manet on the list.
But then your girl detective there, she did a little more digging and found this.
This is William Charles Pulver's boat.
Yacht.
Yacht.
- He's a billionaire.
- Millionaire.
Former billionaire, now millionaire, living off of his yacht.
Has an extensive art collection.
He sailed into town yesterday.
He has a late-period Manet hanging over the piano in his state room.
What exactly are you wearing?
What?
You look like Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago.
I get cold, okay?
- I grew up in a subtropical climate.
- No, I didn't mean it I think it's, you know, I mean I think it looks nice.
What is the matter with you?
- I don't know.
We can still talk as friends.
- I know that.
- All right, I can't do this.
Spencer, you've got to find me a weapon of some sort.
I don't care if it's a cane with a blow dart in it.
- If this thing goes down - We're waiting for a single man to enter an empty boat.
Which may require deadly force.
Shawn, I gotta pee.
- I told you to go back at the hotel.
- I couldn't.
I got freaked out.
There were rose petals everywhere.
All over the toilet.
Why would they do that?
It's weird.
It's not weird.
It's wonderful.
- Did you see that?
- What?
I saw something.
It's a shadow.
It's a person.
- What is he doing out here?
- He's definitely packing heat.
- That makes one of you.
- Shut up, Guster.
- Let's all just think this through.
- There is a man and a shadow on the dock.
- A man and a shadow down on the dock.
- Tell them not to approach.
Don't approach.
- Don't approach the man or the shadow.
- They're approaching!
False alarm.
It is a false alarm.
This is not our perp.
- Everybody back to - It's too late.
He took it already.
That's definitely not a Manet.
So he pretty much told us exactly what he was going to steal, where he was gonna steal it from, when he was gonna be there, we couldn't catch him.
I mean, how good is this guy, Gus?
Why are we on this carriage ride?
You don't find it oddly romantic?
What?
No.
Not at all.
What better way for a couple best buddies to take in the stars, some cool, crisp Canadian air?
Maybe solve an art theft.
So just let me know when you want me to head to the kissing bridge.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
Wait a Now it all makes sense.
This whole thing.
The rose petals on the bed.
The reservation at the bistro.
Now this carriage ride.
This whole trip.
It was all planned as a romantic week for you and Abigail.
All right.
I admit it.
The dates for her teacher's conference changed quite unexpectedly.
That's why you asked me at the last minute.
I was an afterthought?
Don't get caught up in the minutiae of trip planning.
That's it.
You deceived me, Shawn.
I'm done with this.
I'm finished.
We need to figure out what his next move is.
Besides, you do not wanna get out of this carriage.
It's freezing.
It's dark out here.
And there are most likely raccoons everywhere.
I'm staying here.
You are getting out.
My credit card paid for this ride, and I'm taking it, just not with you.
But good luck figuring out this case.
What are you Stop it!
At least leave me the blanket!
Hello, raccoons.
I know you're watching me.
I don't blame you.
I'd be doing the same thing if I was you.
I mean, who am I?
Some mysterious biped infiltrating your natural habitat.
I know you don't mean to scare me with your beady little yellow eyes that glow like the devil.
Let's do a list we'll do a list of famous raccoons.
Meeko from Pocahontas.
Check.
Rocky Raccoon.
Judges, good reading on Rocky Ra Where do you think you're going?
To my room.
Okay, you little masked night bandits.
I gotta go.
I think I know where Despereaux is.
But you're probably not interested.
Well, it's Maybe a couple of you are.
More so than More so than the others.
Hello, Bertrand.
- Yes, sir.
How may I help you?
- I seem to have misplaced my card key.
I'd be happy to replace your key.
I just need your name.
Pierre Despereaux.
I'm sorry, there's no one by that name registered here.
Despereaux always comes in and out of town undetected with an army of aliases, usually of an artist.
Here's the thing.
I register under lots of different names in order to protect my privacy, so why don't we try "John Van Gogh".
Nothing?
Jacques Hockneystine?
"Stein".
I'm not sure what shenanigans you're up to, but I don't like it, I don't appreciate it.
It might've been Edgar Degas.
That name is here.
- Do you think I could - I'm so sorry about this.
My assistant makes all the reservations.
She's been under heavy medication.
She was recently diagnosed with parvo.
Isn't that a dog's disease?
Yes.
Yes it is.
My assistant is a golden retriever.
Adorable, but dim.
Her whole keyboard is just three big buttons.
She has very large paws.
Should've fired her years ago, but she's a rescue, and I just didn't have the heart.
Gus, guess where I am right now?
I'm in Despereaux's room right now.
No, I'm not kidding.
I'm gonna rifle through all of this stuff, and I'm totally gonna pull a J. Turturro from Miller's crossing on him.
And then we'll get some sundaes.
I'm just gonna sit here quietly, wait for him to get back, and then I'm gonna click on the lamp.
Scare the gingersnaps out of him.
What.
No, I don't remember how that movie ends, why?
That's a "negativo" on the sundaes, buddy.
I repeat, negative on the sundaes.
So.
So This is your room?
This is embarrassing, isn't it?
I mean, it's a real rattlesnake of a misunderstanding.
It's amazing how much this place looks just like the room that Gus and I have over at the Captain Vancouver do-right inn.
Sit.
I never was a fan of Miller's crossing.
Too much gore and violence.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I appreciate a good murder.
But why does it have to be so messy?
Where's the elegance?
The grace?
People don't kill people with panache anymore.
I wish I could stay and chat with you, but I'm getting ready to press on.
There wouldn't happen to be a Manet in that suitcase by any chance, would there?
You know, you should keep at this detective business.
You have the hair for it, and that's half the battle.
What?
You thought my Marco Ciccone loafers were a gun?
Maybe.
This is my gun, you see?
A gentleman of leisure never packs his weapon next to his socks.
It's uncouth.
What, you think I'm going to kill you?
You're right.
Not yet, anyway.
I have to be pushed very hard to get into that kind of business.
Number one, it's messy.
And I have to spend one more night here.
Number two, you have nothing on me but your word.
Your very shaky, very suspect word.
Therefore, you pose absolutely no threat to me whatsoever.
I do have to thank you, though.
You have been very useful for me.
My pleasure.
And now, if you don't mind I don't even know how to respond.
I'm both relieved and offended at the same time.
But I know when I'm beat.
One more thing.
What day is today?
Sunday.
That's what I thought.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I am telling you, he is done.
- He is heading for the border.
- Listen.
It's not Molson time just yet.
- He's gonna steal one more thing.
- So what?
- I don't know.
- Where is it?
I don't have a completely clear picture on that, but I am honing.
I am a honer.
There is a small jet waiting at a private airfield just over the border in Blaine, Washington, registered to one of his aliases.
Barry Picasso?
It's scheduled to take off in 4 hours.
We plan on being there.
Here's the thing.
I actually spoke with him last night.
What do you mean, you spoke with him?
I had a vision, wherein we we spoke.
See, he had a vision.
What exactly was he doing in this vision?
Packing.
- Of course, because he's leaving town!
- Wrong, because he wanted me to think he was leaving town.
It was all a show for my benefit.
There is no way this guy would leave town with out his dry cleaning, and that does not get delivered until Tuesday.
Trust me, he cares just as much about his pants as he does about thievery.
So let me get this straight, Despereaux comes to you in a vision to fake doing something?
I do have to thank you, though.
You have been very useful for me.
I was a smokescreen.
He used me as a smokescreen.
I'm sorry, Shawn, but this is a really good lead.
Wait, wait, guys!
Don't you at least want to hear my plan?
It could be good!
You don't know.
What?
- I want to see your book.
- My book?
With things that Despereaux might steal.
- Nobody ever wants to see my book.
- I do.
I want to see the book.
I'm also going to eat these waffles.
I gotta hand it to you, Mackintosh.
The binding on this thing is impressive.
The presentation, I mean Just outstanding.
And then the next day I'm going to treat myself like a king.
He told me everything.
That clever bastard.
Who?
What can you tell me about the buschlen mowatt gallery in Yaletown?
I know quite a bit, actually.
What in particular?
The security system.
Government issue.
I was on the team that installed it and set it up.
That's fortuitous.
Can it be set down?
I have a shot at redemption for you.
For recognition.
But it's going to be dangerous.
And we're gonna need Gus.
Are you in?
Wait before you answer that.
Are you a fan of solving crimes?
That's my man.
- That's him.
- That's who?
That's the gallery owner.
He's the last one out.
That means it's closed.
We can go inside.
- That's where the crown is.
- That was your plan?
- To steal the crown?
- No.
Absolutely not.
Don't be ridiculous.
Possibly move the crown at best.
But the point is to get to it first, before Despereaux.
Not only is this a felony of international proportions, but also, we are not art thieves.
What do you think this is for?
Big apple, come in.
Are we good to go?
Just about, Shawn.
Over.
See, Gus?
It's not really breaking in if the actual cops help you break in, am I right?
Do I need to explain the law to you?
You can try, but It's probably not gonna make much of a difference.
So how do you plan on getting through this obstacle?
Dude, I know you've seen Entrapment at least 26 times.
You have to do this.
You're twice as limber as C. Zeta-Jones.
- Not happening.
- We don't have a lot of options here.
It's not like we can turn back.
Look, it's three lasers.
Plus, they're canadian lasers.
I'm gonna guide you through this.
Usain Bolt.
- Gus to the world.
- That's what i'm talkin' about!
You got this.
That's it, buddy.
Now now lower your right shoulder just a little bit, like two inches.
Yeah, there you go.
That's your way in.
That's your gateway.
Arch your back.
Clear.
Watch your feet, watch your feet.
Okay, you're good.
Okay, all right.
This one's a little trickier.
Knee to chest.
Knee to chest!
Now pivot about 30 degrees to your left.
Safe.
Dude, that's your safe haven.
Right hand green!
Right hand green!
That's twister, Shawn.
How come we don't play that anymore?
Get your butt higher!
Arch your back!
Spread your cheeks if you can.
Scratch that.
Abort cheek spreading.
Pivot.
Pivot your body about 30 degrees.
Left, to the left.
You got it.
But what?
- What are you doing?
- I had Mackintosh disarm the lasers.
But I wanted to see how you would do it.
Now we know for the future that if we ever encounter this exact scenario, you are the man for the job.
What?
There it is.
Where's the crown?
It's in that metal box.
It closes when the gallery does.
Don't worry, Mackintosh disarmed this too.
This, my friend, is the easy part.
You said this was the easy part.
It's supposed to be the easy part!
Don't I get any credit for planning this whole thing in less than two hours?
No, you don't!
The cops are gonna be here any second now.
They will not.
Man, stop playing.
There's nobody behind me.
- Shut up, Shawn.
- I'm not turning around.
Freeze!
Dad!
They arrested you too?
I posted your bail.
It was more than I expected.
You owe me the difference plus the exchange rate.
Do you realize they charged me nine bucks for a nusmagazine?
- And me?
- You didn't bail out Gus?
I gotta bail both of you out?
And your dad?
Shawn used my one call to vote for American Idol.
You didn't say anything about Gus.
I thought he had his own cash.
- Don't you have a credit card?
- My CB is maxed out.
Dad, believe me, I've spoken to him about not overextending himself.
- Do you really think this is fun?
- Stanley park was nice.
- You can't leave this country.
- Dad, do you understand?
We had him.
But But what?
- He was too good.
- Too good?
- What'd I raise you to do?
- It was literally the perfect crime.
The perfect crime?
There is no such thing as a perfect crime.
Well then, it was as close as you can possibly get.
The only way it's close is if you make it look like the perfect crime.
Now, I'm gonna see if I can put Gus on my credit card.
In the meantime, I got a 4:00 salmon boat, and if I Miss that, this trip is a complete waste.
Big apple.
What is this?
What happened?
- Fired.
- Why?
Really?
Because of what happened down at the museum.
Man, I'm so sorry.
- This is partially my fault.
- Partially?
It was your idea.
It probably would've just been a suspension, but then the crown ended up going missing - Say what?
- You know?
It was gone.
- When they opened the case.
- That's impossible.
No, when they opened the metal display case, the crown was missing.
Where's the crown?
It's in that metal box.
It closes when the gallery does.
Dude, we watched the museum close.
We watched the thing close.
We never left the building.
The only way he could've taken it is if How?
Is if he had had it all along.
I sold that painting two weeks ago.
- He's a billionaire.
- Millionaire.
Okay, former billionaire, now millionaire, living off his yacht.
I know why Despereaux never gets caught!
Because he doesn't steal anything!
- We gotta hurry.
- That's my helmet.
You have an impressive learning curve.
Thank you.
I also play the mandocello.
Not well.
But who else do you know who plays the mandocello?
- I'm no longer amused.
- You almost had me.
The yacht and the high rise were just flawless.
But you left me too much time when you stole the crown.
And I covered all my bases.
Which means you didn't have time to steal the crown.
But then, you didn't have to, because the owner just handed it to you.
- I knew you were worthy.
- Worthy.
And very disappointed.
Really?
I've been hiding back here for ten minutes.
I thought you were gonna give your speech from inside the plane.
- I'm seriously cramped back here.
- I'm about to drop the hammer on him.
Just flag down the stewardess.
Order a mojito.
Just call me when you're done.
Man, I thought you were so cool.
But you're just here to look the part.
This whole time, I'm thinking, "this guy is Thomas Crown".
You're barely Remington Steele.
Which makes me, what, Laura Holt?
You think a guy like me wants to be Stephanie Zimbalist?
Maybe.
The items were handed to you one by one.
- That's him.
- That's who?
That's the gallery owner.
He's the last one out.
The gallery owner had the crown when he left the gallery.
He was having money troubles.
As did the rest of your victims.
And you You're just the middleman.
You made it look like the items were being stolen.
Hence your calling card.
And always in a series, right?
So it wouldn't call suspicion to an owner in financial peril who suddenly gets his Manet stolen?
Insurance fraud.
Really?
That is so lame.
- Do you even have a pilot's license?
- I do.
But now I feel as though I have to hurt you, which saddens me.
I thought you were a master criminal.
The genius of my plan is in its simplicity.
Perhaps it's not as sexy as you believed.
But don't forget, I got away with it.
No, you didn't.
Bet you're not too happy to see me right about now, are you?
I have absolutely no idea who you are.
Detective.
Thank you.
Your boss is really good.
We do not work for him.
It just seems that way sometimes.
I've often fantasized about escaping from prison, you know.
Don't you think it's odd that you're in a relationship now, yet you invite me to maybe the most romantic place on earth?
Jules, listen.
I made these plans weeks ago.
And Gus refused to come on account he's a man.
And I'm a man.
Or some nonsense like that.
Look, I have a point.
It's this.
I refuse to feel uncomfortable around you.
It's silly.
You mean too much to me.
And I am perfectly capable of keeping this platonic as long as you are.
- Please.
I can.
- Well, I can too.
Great.
But how?
So at least show me what you had planned for this perfect date.
Okay, but promise not to laugh.
You hired this guy?
Technically, Gus did.
Would've lost our deposit.
He was supposed to be more discreet.
This is overkill, huh?
Not if you're six.
A mime, though?
Really, Shawn?
I don't know, you don't really strike me as a mime guy.
The mime had nothing to do with me.
This mime is clearly working on his own.
- You seen enough?
- More than.
- So abigail's into opera, huh?
- No, not really.
Just robust italian men.
I didn't even know he sang, actually.
- Look at that bridge.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.
Little-known fact: - that bridge was built by wolves.
- Really?
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Dad?
I'm not feeling well.
Come here.
Let me take a look.
I'm probably too sick to go to Jimmy Peoples' house.
You better call and cancel.
Right after that, I'll call the coroner.
- you're a dead man walking.
- I am?
I give you 5, The good news is, this happened soon enough for your mother and I to start over again.
Maybe this time we'll have a girl.
How'd you know I was faking?
Your first mistake was sticking the thermometer in boiling water.
Next time, try putting it in a hot sandwich or behind the television.
And why don't you want to go to Jimmy's?
They were kind enough to invite us over.
They're the weirdest family on the entire block.
Shawn, there is something weird about every family.
- That's what makes America great.
- They eat weird food.
All food is weird until you try it.
- I mean, they don't even eat meat.
- You mean they're vegetarians.
I think they call it "vegan".
You guys ready for some barbecue tofu?
I think I got that same thing you got.
I'll be right back.
Thank you, gentlemen, for helping out.
Search and rescue is my middle name.
Our missing person is Warren Clayton.
- The billionaire investor?
- Yes, that's the one.
His hedge fund has had an average annual return of 20% for the last 10 years.
Mr. Clayton's private plane lost contact with the tower around 0700.
We have reason to believe that his plane crashed somewhere in these mountains.
Now, Mr. Spencer, time is of the essence.
I need to know of any signals that you pick up that can lead us to him.
Okay, people, our window of finding Clayton alive is closing.
So let's move on out.
Face it, Spencer, you don't have a chance of finding that downed plane before we do.
But have a nice walk.
Let's go.
Note to self: get one of those for the office.
I hope you have a plan as to how we're going to find this crashed plane.
And I hope that plan doesn't end up with us being eaten by a bear.
- Don't worry.
We have a secret weapon.
- A larger, bear-eating bear?
A map?
That's your secret weapon?
This is not a typical map, my friend.
With large words that people don't understand, like "latitudinal" and "east".
This here is a map from my father's huntsman club.
These old geezers make their own maps with trails and paths, landmarks, that government maps don't even have.
We will use these shortcuts to cover more ground than the cops can.
Sweet.
That sounded big.
That's a bear.
Let's get out of here.
- I'm not gonna be eaten!
- Me either!
- Did that sound like metal to you?
- It did.
That's him.
Dude, we're heroes.
Right.
Don't worry, Mr. Clayton.
Help is on the way.
- No signal!
- All right, sir.
It's gonna be okay.
Just try to hold still.
Need to make amends.
Good father.
You understand?
You know, good father's kind of a tricky subject for me.
Try to conserve your energy, Mr. Clayton.
Waterloo.
He's an Abba fan.
Find out who killed me.
- Open your eyes.
Stay with us here.
- Watch out.
I know what to do.
Mr. Clayton.
Mr. Clayton.
What industry sectors do you see outperforming the market this year?
Are you serious?
I'm trying to give him something to think about.
It didn't work.
He's dead.
That's a lose-lose.
Psych 402 "He Dead" Timing: Psych Team Lower the basket as soon as you're in position.
See you back at base camp.
- It's out of our hands now.
- Not so fast.
We've been given a great responsibility.
How so?
Warren Clayton's dying wish.
Man, what if that had been your dad?
Or my dad?
Some other random black guy and white guy found him with one breath left?
Wouldn't you want those dudes to fulfill our dads' final wish?
- Especially if it was about us?
- You think of me as some random Black?
Man, we gotta figure out what happened.
What did he mean?
I mean, was he poisoned before takeoff, or was he incapacitated, and then somebody else parachuted out?
- Or maybe it was a - It wasn't a bear.
- I wasn't gonna say that, Shawn.
- What were you gonna say?
We know you want answers.
But you gotta understand, these things do take time.
Please.
It only takes money.
Have you found satellite imaging of the plane before it crashed?
- Have you run a weather simulation?
- Rest assured that the SBPD is putting all available resources on this.
Almost all of its resources.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm the department psychic.
Mrs. Clayton, I'm receiving a psychic transmission from your husband.
It's really more of a voice mail, if I'm being honest.
A status update.
- Perhaps a twitter.
- It's called a tweet.
- No way I'm saying that.
- Is he for real?
In spite of Mr. Spencer's first impression, he is actually the one who led us to your husband's plane.
He knew what clothes your husband was wearing, how his body was positioned, even what cologne he was I knew what cologne he was wearing.
I mean, he did.
Well, let's hear this supposed message from my husband.
It's a little cloudy, Warren is very upset.
He's saying "murder".
He's saying "murder".
Does the word "waterloo" mean anything to you, Mrs. Clayton?
You've wasted enough of Mrs. Clayton's time with your nonsense.
No, wait.
I'm really quite shocked.
You are?
Yes, it just doesn't show on my face because of years of botox.
Waterloo is the name of the 18th hole at our country club.
Warren mentioned just a week ago that he wanted his ashes spread there.
- Yes, of course.
- Strange.
Not strange.
Psychic acumen.
You will solve the mystery of why my husband's plane crashed.
Technically, Mr. Spencer's not been hired This no longer concerns the police, as I will be financing Mr. Spencer's operations.
I am sure the taxpayers' money is better spent on some social program, or a tree.
What resources will you be needing?
One.
A case of red vines, individually wrapped.
Two, mini fridge filled with Cactus Cooler.
- Need a ShamWow.
- A new laptop.
Tell her.
A new laptop, preferably one made of red vines.
Gentlemen, you are no longer limited by a police department budget.
Tell me what it will take to get this done quickly.
Well, in that case, I'll need to become Warren Clayton.
Go where he'd go, do what he'd do, see what he'd see.
Very well.
You will start your work by being my guests at dinner tonight at my estate.
The estate.
Say what?
- I'll send the car to pick you up.
- The car.
Nice.
- The door.
- The door.
- Big door.
- The door!
Of course, the door.
Get out of here.
As I gently held his skull, which was fractured in several places, I was able to keep death's cold clutch from enveloping Clayton just long enough for him to express his dying wish.
Shawn, that is revisionist history and you know it.
- You had to be there.
- I was there.
- It's okay.
When he embellishes - Lies.
- Clarifies.
- It lets me know that he cares.
But what I really want to know is when can I meet your father?
My relationship with my father is complicated.
As I believe I've mentioned.
And I know you You'll wanna get in there and fix everything.
And no amount of talking or listening or hugging is going to fix anything between me and my dad.
I'm sorry.
I hear you, and I'm going to stop pressuring you.
Thank you.
Besides, you already know everything there is to know about me.
I'm really quite a simple man.
Mr. Spencer's private car is here to take him to the Clayton estate.
- Thank you, my good man.
- We are ready.
Dinner will be served shortly.
Note to self: be rich one day.
This is what real class looks like.
I feel like I'm in a museum filled with priceless artifacts.
Only here you're not allowed to touch or play with anything.
But let's not be blinded by the bling.
Remember, we're here to fulfill Mr. Clayton's dying wish.
- Find out who it was that murdered him.
- If he was even murdered.
For all we know, he was hallucinating when he said that.
Make no mistake, Gus.
When I cradled the man's head and he breathed his last breath, he looked right into my eyes.
And I am certain he knew exactly what he was saying.
I was there.
You didn't cradle anything.
There you are.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I was putting things away.
So many memories of Clay.
That's what I called him.
Is that an ultra-high modulus hyper carbon racket?
This is my birthday present from him last year.
He even signed me up for tennis lessons with Malavia.
Malavia Washington?
The one-time Wimbledon finalist?
But he's a marvelous teacher.
I never missed a lesson.
Thank you, Mrs. Clayton, for inviting us here to your beautiful home.
My pleasure.
We're all very eager to learn the circumstances behind my husband's accident.
Our son is beside himself about it.
Garvin, remember mommy telling you about the psychic who saw why papa's plane crashed?
That's unusual.
It's very heathers.
What do they call you?
Gar?
- Vin?
- I get it, even though I was, like, zero when that movie came out.
Man, stop trying to look cool.
I have peeps, Shawn.
You have two peeps.
And one of them's made out of marshmallow.
Mrs. Clayton, you don't mind my asking, who is the girl in the family photos?
That's my daughter, Nyna.
She's no longer with us.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Quiet, everyone.
Mr. Spencer will now have a revelation regarding the cause of Warren's crash.
What Have a revelation?
I'm not.
It's too early for that.
We haven't even had our foie gras yet.
Foie gras.
I have to decipher psychic signals.
It's very important that I tap into your husband's aurora.
Tell me, Mrs. Clayton, does he have a smoking jacket that I could wear?
Does he have down sheets, and if so, are they hypoallergenic, because I would hate for my signals to get all scrambled up while I'm sleeping here tonight in your home.
Based on your earlier display, - I expected immediate results.
- Bogus.
Poser.
Asthma.
- He's allergic to rich white people.
- Sorry.
As I was saying, I pay for results.
My new chin is proof of that.
Our family needs closure before Warren's will is unsealed this weekend.
Since you are unable to deliver, Rosa, would you put Mr. Spencer's food in some sort of a bag?
Where shall I have the car drop you off?
Hold that thought.
As luck would have it, exactly two of my psychic channels are clearing up, and I am getting something.
I thought you might.
[It has nothing to do with Mr. Clayton and everything to do with you.
You've been seeing a tennis instructor every week for the la year, but you haven't been playing tennis.
Though you have been playing with balls.
I see a very - compromising image.
- I don't know what you mean.
Is that why you practice at night?
This isn't supposed to be about me.
No wonder you have so many sexy tennis outfits.
I'm not gonna sit here and be judged.
If I were having an affair, it would be because we have a loveless marriage, and not through any fault of my own.
I don't talk ill of the dead.
I'll talk about him any way I please.
In fact, not that I owe you an explanation, but before he died, things had gotten better.
He was trying to be the man that I once loved.
Funny you should chime in.
You know the Clayton's philandering ways better than anyone, seeing as how you were in fact senor Clayton's mistress.
What?
That's why you pray to St. Dwynwen, the patron saint of dirty filthy lovers in the nighttime.
Who is this man?
Make me make him leave.
You had an affair with my husband?
How dare you!
- You're no better, puta.
- You know what?
This is all your fault.
You pushed him away and he took it out on me.
Taking away my Porsche, making me get a job, selling my tiger.
And I hated you both.
You blame everybody for your pathetic This family is crazy as hell.
Now we see why Warren Clayton thought he was murdered.
As you can see, like most families, we have our issues.
Now that you are privy to them, I expect you to handle this with discretion.
We do have a public image to protect.
That's going to be difficult.
Especially once I prove that it was one of you three who killed Warren Clayton.
Is that so?
And how is my favorite police department doing today?
Lassie, looking handsome and jangly.
Chief I don't say this nearly enough You have exquisite teeth.
Mr. Spencer, you know, the last I'd heard is that you'd taken an assignment that provided you with more benefits than what we could give you.
Yes, unfortunately, Mrs. Clayton and I were unable to see eye to eye.
- In other words, you got fired.
- Or maybe I was getting too close.
Or maybe you were acting like an obnoxious little twerp.
I'm sticking with getting too close.
It's nice to hear the word "twerp" has survived the millennium.
Trust me on this one, chief.
There is more to Warren Clayton's plane crash than meets the eye.
Funny, the NTSB's preliminary report indicates that it was an accident due to pilot error.
The black box shows that he was coming into SB and descended too rapidly.
Trust requires evidence, Mr. Spencer.
I'm getting distinct visions.
Family secrets.
A large skeleton in a closet.
Clayton was trying to make amends.
But he was being met with infidelities and backbiting.
And front biting.
And jealousies.
I suppose it couldn't hurt to check to see if there are any signs of a cover-up, just in case there's anything to his premonition.
Chief, come on.
And you better come up with something soon, or this will be the second time that you're fired from the same case.
I hear you.
Thank you for taking the leap.
What time should I expect the car?
You think you guys could spring for a case of red vines?
This is how I should be living by now.
Where did I go wrong?
I don't know about you, Gus, but I was born into the wrong family.
If I belonged to a club like this, I'd have to cancel my membership on account of them letting in the likes of me.
And if you voted for me, well, I'm afraid you don't belong in my club either.
That doesn't even make sense.
Neither does "thoo," but it is a word.
No, it's not.
There's simply no way to be sure.
My point is this: no matter how glamorous their lives look from the outside, these - are not our kind of people.
- Will you stop it?
Take Mr. Clayton, for example.
He was the patriarch of his family, yet where were they when the life was draining out of his body and that sweet chariot had swung low to carry him home?
Out philandering and social climbing, I suspect.
Meanwhile, where was I?
- I was beside him.
Like a true friend.
- Stop it.
I see the two of you don't give up easily.
You should know that this is now an official police investigation.
We've been granted full access, and if your family's hiding anything, we'll find it.
We don't hide anything except large amounts of money, illegitimate children, and the fact that we're jewish.
We may have a lot of secrets, but killing Clay isn't one of them.
The door.
- The door.
- Right, yes.
The door.
I forgot that's a thing with you.
Good luck getting anyone here to talk to you.
She's right.
How are we gonna get people to talk to us?
Let me guess.
You've got a idea that shouldn't work on paper, but ultimately proves to be reasonably successful?
So, how long you been members?
This is just a trial membership.
We only belong to the most exclusive clubs.
- I had no idea psychics did so well.
- Most don't.
- Some do.
- Many try.
- Few can.
- I have.
Since we've been here, everyone's been talking about Clayton.
- It's heartbreaking.
- Plain and simple.
Come on.
He was one of the best hedge fund managers around.
One of the only guys showing a positive return in this recession.
Which is why we put up with some of his more eccentric behavior.
To a point.
Let's keep things interesting.
$1,000 a hole?
Sure, why not.
You guys bet like this often?
Sometimes we actually play for high stakes.
I'm actually getting a reading on both of you gentlemen right now.
Sorry.
I know it's your thing, but I don't go for that psychic mumbo-jumbo.
What I'm seeing is that sometimes you play for obscenely high stakes.
Like the private plane that Warren Clayton crashed and died in.
All right.
That's pretty good.
I lost the jet to Clayton in a skins match a couple months ago.
Now, that must have made you pretty mad.
Sure.
But before anybody goes and gets the wrong idea, I was in Europe when Warren's plane crashed.
Like I told the cops, last time I spoke to Warren, he was planning on using the plane to travel more with his family.
He even got a private hangar down at the airport for them.
That means everyone in his family had access to that plane.
This is what I figure.
I figure someone in Warren Clayton's family got to that plane and sabotaged it before he took off.
Which means we have to get down to that private hangar and look around.
- Let's go.
- Wait.
Don't you think you should check in with Abigail first?
- Why?
I'm not on parole.
- You told her you'd call.
You can't be your lackadaisical self in this relationship.
Abigail is the kind of girl that needs a certain amount of effort.
"Relationship Shawn" needs to step up his game.
First of all, there is no "Relationship Shawn" or "Boyfriend Shawn".
There's just Regular Shawn and Malibu Shawn.
You know that.
Besides, I was with her this morning.
What am I supposed to check in about?
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I'm not talking about that.
- I'm talking about relationships.
- How do you know about this stuff?
- A player always knows, Shawn.
- Please.
- Man, hold on.
- Fine.
This is a surprise.
What's the matter?
Nothing's wrong.
I'm just calling to check in.
Coffee's ready.
Hold on.
Was that my dad's voice?
I'm at your dad's.
I thought we agreed.
No pressure.
Yes, I said I wouldn't pressure you.
So I set it up myself.
And it's been very interesting, to say the least.
What did he do?
Did he fire a weapon?
- Tell me he didn't bait a hook.
- He's been a lot of fun.
You wanna see how far I can spit?
All right, that's it.
I'm coming over there right now.
No need.
We're just wrapping up.
But we're making plans for us to have dinner sometime soon.
Great.
That's That's great.
I can't wait.
I gotta go.
Bye.
Why didn't you tell me to check in sooner?
Please, Shawn.
If someone asks what we're doing here, what are we gonna say?
This is an airport, Shawn.
We can't sniff around.
- I don't want to end up in Guantanamo.
- Gus, don't be principal and interest.
I already have plan.
Hello sir.
We are here for our 2:00 appointment.
Is one of you guys Gus?
- Appointment for what?
- It's a flight lesson.
I'll be right with you.
Go with it.
Distract him while I take a sniff around.
Who made the rule that I've to be the distraction?
- Do you know what you're looking for?
- I'll know it when I see it.
It's not that pebble.
When you're finished, I'll need you to teach me everything you've learned about how a plane works.
Don't worry.
Flying is just like driving a car.
- It's not like that at all.
- You see that?
You're gonna be fine.
I need you to sign this waiver.
Here, here, here.
Here, here, here, here, and here.
Also a copy of your driver's license and insurance Dude, this is sweet.
I'll meet up with you after you land.
I'm ready for my lesson now.
You already had it.
We just landed.
I'm ready for my lesson now.
Let me ask you a question.
How long does it take to refuel a twin-engine plane?
Hey, buddy.
Nobody had access to the new plane but Clayton.
And here's a new wrinkle in the case: guess which dead billionaire took a four-hour stop that wasn't in the official flight log?
So why would Clayton spend four hours in Bakersfield?
I'm ready for my lesson now.
Yeah, you are.
And what time did you pick him up?
Thank you, Wayne.
You've been very helpful.
All right.
After calling every car service in Bakersfield - Two.
- I found the one that took Clayton - to the airport.
- So your hunch was right.
He went someplace else while he was there.
Gus, note to self.
Remember 1600 Joshua Lane.
You can't give me your note to self.
It's a note to yourself.
Fair enough.
At that moment, Shawn found himself alone, unable to face the journey ahead.
You can't do your own omniscient narration either.
Let's see what's at 1313 Mockingbird Lane.
That's the Munsters' house.
It was 1600 Joshua Lane.
Thanks, note to self.
Thanks, jules.
So Juliet traced the address to an environmental watchdog agency.
It's a nonprofit run by a Mrs. Thomas.
How's that legislation on the emissions credits coming along?
Why would Clayton come here?
Mrs. Thomas?
- May I help you?
- I certainly hope so.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
This is my associate, Jazz Hands.
Does the name Warren Clayton mean anything to you?
Come with me.
We're investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr. Clayton's death.
We believe he may have been murdered.
That's karma for you.
You guys believe in karma, don't you?
Yes, we do.
But only because we are karma chameleons.
We come and go.
My psychic sensors led me here.
And I am getting traces of Warren's meta-essence.
Here.
There.
And, somewhat shockingly, - right there.
- Well, that's uncanny.
If only you were as attuned to environmental issues.
Sorry.
I always forget which one is mine, so I just open a new one.
I like the little clicky-clack sound it makes when you - That one didn't do it.
- Yes, Warren did come visit me.
We talked business for a few hours, and then he left.
Later I saw that he was dead.
I couldn't believe it.
You talked business?
He didn't seem like the environmental type.
He wasn't.
This company's been at odds with him ever since my husband and I started it.
- He must be seven feet tall.
- That's a Masai tribesman.
Charles is standing right next to him.
Shawn, you're wasting paper.
Rain dance.
Seriously, do you mind?
You know what they say about a man with a large carbon footprint?
Please ignore him.
So why did Mr. Clayton come see you?
He wanted my endorsement in a business move that, let's just say I didn't approve of.
When I refused, things got heated.
But I'm used to Clay's temper.
So many memories of Clay.
That's what I called him.
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm Charles.
And I'm Shawn Spencer, and this is Don't forget to schedule that lunch with councilman Prather.
Sure thing.
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.
I think you should've stuck with the Masai guy.
What?
They would've had caramel babies with 30-inch verticals.
I'm sorry.
We have to go.
Thank you for your time.
- Happy?
- You can't recycle food, Shawn.
- How many rules are there?
- Pretty much just that one.
Now I kind of want to eat it.
Let's go.
There's something she's not telling us.
Did you see how she changed the subject when her husband came around?
Plus she called Warren "Clay," which is what his wife called him.
Sounds like Mrs. Thomas is more than just a business acquaintance.
Sounds like she's another filthy mistress.
And she fits Warren's type.
She's all headstrong, hot in a female DA or detective on Law & Order sort of way.
Like Milena Govich?
- Like an Angie Harmon.
- Like Mariska Hargitay?
Exactly.
Which explains why the meeting got all heated.
In fact, before he died, he tried to be the man that I once loved.
Katie Erbe?
Dude.
I think Warren was trying to reconcile with his wife.
And I bet Ms. Green Jeans in there wasn't too happy about it.
- Sounds like motive.
- We gotta get Lassie on this.
We need to get out of this office.
Take your time reading it, okay?
Because it's going to be Are the police still wasting valuable time on your little theory - that one of us is a murderer?
- Yes.
About that.
I did get a few of my psychic signals crossed.
But what is not important, Mrs. Clayton, - is who accused who of "partricide".
- You mean patricide.
- What's that?
- Killing a partridge.
- It's a victimless crime.
- No.
- Who's the victim?
- The partridge.
Here's what's important.
I have identified the culprit responsible for your husband's untimely death.
Your family is off the hook.
Finally.
So who is it?
Who is responsible for this atrocity?
Another gold-digging, yet far less exotic - mistress.
- Mr. Spencer's theory was confirmed when we found out your husband had recently changed his will.
What?
Upon his death, the bulk of his estate is now going to the great green hope.
Plus forensics confirmed that the plane's altimeter was tampered with, and our suspect had her pilot's license, which means she knew enough to sabotage the controls.
It's enough for a warrant.
Thank God.
Very impressive.
I'm glad my initial instinct about you was correct, Mr. Spencer.
There's our suspect.
Let's go.
Stop right there.
- Hands behind your back.
- What is going on?
Can't believe she showed up at the will reading.
- Who does she think she is?
- My daughter?
My sister?
Who are we talking about?
Nyna Thomas, you have the right to remain silent.
Let's go.
That's my daughter, Nyna.
She's no longer with us.
I can't believe you think I would kill my own father.
In my defense, I initially thought you were sleeping with him.
How pumped are you that I was wrong about that?
But you called him "Clay" instead of "dad" or "father".
I stopped calling him "dad" years ago when I denounced our way of life.
Okay, then why were you so uncomfortable when your husband came into the room?
Because I try to keep my past from interfering with my new life with Charles.
Then we can all agree that this is completely your fault.
When Warren came to visit me, to tell me some story about how he'd changed and he wanted to reconcile, I promptly told him to kiss off and keep his dirty money.
But now that he's dead, I can't help but wish I'd given him a second chance.
Listen, Nyna's a saint.
And that's why she didn't mention the money at first.
What else have you failed to mention, Nyna?
Well, I didn't think it was important at the time, but now I realize that it might be.
I overheard my dad arguing with one of his golf buddies.
Something about a problem with one of his investments.
Golf buddies?
- So, what can I do for you boys?
- Mr. Wiswall, you told us that you hadn't spoken to Warren Clayton for months.
Then I had a vision of an argument.
Something about investments, returns.
Capital gains.
That's a That's a thing, right?
No flies on you.
I'm afraid that's only the tip of the iceberg.
- You see, I'm also seeing - Wait, wait.
All right, all right.
Let me just set the record straight.
Just before Warren died, I called him, livid, about money missing from my account.
He then confessed to me that his billion-dollar hedge fund was a giant Ponzi scheme.
Stop right there.
I simply refuse to believe that Henry Winkler had anything to do with this.
Wait.
If that were the case, the S.E.C. ever found out, that would mean Clayton would be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars.
And his investors would be left with nothing.
- Including yourself.
- He'd already lost all my money.
I had to sell my house, liquidate all my assets.
Christ, I'm living in a hotel.
No one knows, because I've just been keeping up appearances around the club.
- Please, continue.
- I was determined to get my money back one way or another, so I called Clayton the night before he died.
I asked him to at least return the plane.
Then I could sell it for $5 million or so.
The bastard wouldn't even agree to that.
Not even when I threatened to make an anonymous tip to the S.E.C. Who else knows about this alleged Fonzie scheme?
No one that I know of.
I kept all the falsified documents.
Boxes full.
In case I needed proof.
I'm sensing you won't have to hold onto them for much longer.
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.
Abby and I were just talking about my time as a detective.
I'm actually surprised that you never applied to the academy, especially since you're kind of doing the same thing.
We don't really need to get into that, do we, dad?
I trained him to be a real detective.
He wanted to be a professional ass-wipe instead.
Well, dad, the wipe doesn't fall very far from the ass.
Tree.
And it used to bother me when you say things like that.
But not anymore.
You know why?
Because I discovered that no matter who you are or what family you come from, fathers and their children rarely see eye to eye.
Shawn, I think that you and your father would communicate better if you Trap-caught prawns.
- Sounds sad.
- Right, no fixing.
I'd really love to hear Abby's perspective on all this.
Sweetheart?
I think your father would be able to better respect your decisions if the two of you were able to share more of your emotions.
- He's not really the sharing type.
- It's worth a shot.
Really, you're gonna pretend like you've had an emotion since Walker, Texas Ranger got canceled?
At least I'm willing to give it a try.
Okay, all right.
Try this on for size.
You've been in a horrible, fiery plane crash.
You're clinging to life.
All of your organs on the inside Pancaked.
You have 15 seconds to live.
What message do you want to get to me, your only son, before you die?
- I'm not gonna - Go.
- I'm not gonna answer.
- See what I mean?
It's a little harsh to talk about him being in a horrible crash.
You see?
What'd I tell you?
Excuse me.
Perfect timing.
Text from Gus.
Major break in our case.
I have to go.
Dear Abby, Dr. Phil, enjoy.
Dr. Phil is bald.
- Doesn't even fit.
- You're not bald, you're just taller than your hair.
You'd better not be wasting our time.
Yeah, the case against Nyna is really strong.
Prepare yourselves.
I'm about to bust open a brand-new angle on this case, including brand-new motifs.
- Motives.
- Like fraud.
Embezzling-ment.
And sub-prime time toxic assets.
- That's a thing, right?
- You are a child.
Don't touch anything.
- He's dead.
- Man, why does this always happen?
We have to start checking first.
Possible homicide down at Carlyle hotel.
What's a prospectus?
Investment records.
That must be the registration number for Warren Clayton's hedge fund.
Whoever killed Wiswall must have taken the evidence with them.
Good news.
I think I know where they're going next.
They're probably only here for the photo ops.
It's typical.
- Dearly beloved - I think Mr. Clayton would've wanted me - to spread his remains.
- Okay, Shawn, that's enough.
You only spoke to him for, like, 30 seconds.
- He didn't even know your name.
- We were beyond names.
If anyone close to Warren Clayton would like to say a few words?
What What do you think you're Warren Clayton is communicating with me.
Take your hands off of my husband!
From in here.
Dust in the wind.
All we are is dust in What are you doing?
You killed Warren Clayton.
- That's crazy.
- Is it?
Makes perfect sense to me.
Nyna wanted nothing to do with her father's money.
You did.
I know what Nyna said.
And I'm begging you to reconsider.
We could do so much with that money.
Warren refused to reconsider.
He was gonna change his will back to its original form when he returned home the next day.
That is precisely when you set your dastardly plan into effect.
Like your wife, and apparently everyone else in this family, you have extensive knowledge of aircraft-ery.
I can see the alti-meter in the wreckage of Warren's plane.
- Alti-meter?
- Altimeter.
Altimeter.
And the elevation is off by 1,200 feet.
This means it was tampered with.
You caused the crash.
And so warren Clayton died, before he could take your nonprofit organization out of his will.
And you thought you were in the clear.
Until Garvin.
- What?
- Come on, dude.
Yeah, I get it.
It was that guy.
Until you heard about warren's argument with his golf buddy, Chad Wiswall.
Knowing that Wiswall was going to blow the whistle on the Ponzi scheme, thus freezing Mr. Clayton's assets, you went ahead and clubbed him too.
This is ridiculous.
Nyna, tell him.
Is that why you disappeared for hours after my father left?
And why you were shredding paper last night?
Sweetie.
You deserved the money.
We deserved it.
We could've done so much good Officer, hold this man until detectives Lassiter and O'Hara arrive on the scene.
Here, take this.
My work is done.
Please.
- No need to thank me.
- That's not for you.
This is still a funeral, son.
Of course.
- Good job.
- Thanks.
I think I breathed in some dead guy.
Ground ball to second.
Davis has it.
Throw to first Come on in.
Have a seat.
Just watching the game.
All right.
About last night.
Let me be the first to apologize for my behavior.
Considering the fact that we've never tried to kill each other, I'm willing to admit that our family is not as messed up as I thought we were.
All right, very cool.
Very cool.
Apology accepted.
And you know, you asked me that question at dinner the other night, he one about if I only had 15 seconds left to live.
I've got an answer for you.
I'd want to tell you that Well, I'd do my best to express Look, what I want you to know - Wait, wait - That's it, pop.
You're dead.
I'm closing your eyelids.
I'm taking off your watch, putting that thing on craigslist.
Just wanted to say I love you.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Why is there a giant hole in my front yard?
It's simple, dad.
Don't get upset.
The hole was my grave.
What?
Gus made me dig my own grave, then shot me and stole my boots.
Only he didn't bury me far enough, and the buzzards ate my entrails.
So you You were playing cowboys and indians, huh?
Just cowboys.
Playing indians is offensive.
And then the buzzards ate your entrails.
That's awful.
It was a tragic end to our adventure.
But it's the realism that makes it fun.
If it helps, Gus ended up getting hung by a one-eyed, crooked sheriff.
- Did the buzzards eat his entrails too?
- Of course they did.
I got a game for ya.
It's called "get your butt in my yard "and fill in that hole now".
It's the realism that makes that fun too.
He's going to kill us.
What?
He hasn't said a word the whole time he's been driving.
Face it, Shawn.
He's finally snapped.
He asked us for a favor.
That's all.
We can leave anytime we want.
Case in point.
This is all your fault.
You and all your practical jokes you play on him.
Those were team-building exercises to build camaraderie.
How do you build camaraderie by changing someone's bank account numbers?
What the hell's going on back there?
Look, I know I've been a tad annoying in the past.
But shooting Gus and disposing his body in the aquifer is not the answer.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not gonna shoot anyone.
He didn't say anything about knifing anybody.
- Do you really need that clarification?
- It would be nice, yes.
So what's with all the secrecy, you handsome, pasty devil?
What we're doing isn't exactly official Santa Barbara police business, and it isn't exactly in my jurisdiction.
We're going to a small town.
The sheriff's an old friend of mine.
Some unexplained things have been happening at night.
You two have a propensity for finding something from nothing, and I need that gift.
Where's the town?
This is the back.
The back?
Just how old is Old Sonora?
I will ask you to stifle your urge to make fun of everything that is decent.
Sheriff Hank is a good man who deserves not only your respect, but your admiration.
Sheriff!
Well, look at you.
Ain't you a sight for sore eyes?
- Thanks for coming.
- How you doing, sheriff?
These are the men I was telling you about.
This is Burton Guster and Shawn Spencer.
Well, pardon me, but we had a mess of trouble here last night.
Sheriff Hank Mendel.
Pleasure to meet you.
Welcome to Old Sonora.
Thank you, sheriff.
I'm sure you've heard about what I do, how cool it is.
You've now seen my hair, which means you're impressed, but let's not get wrapped up in gushy compliments.
I get a little self-conscious.
Hell, I wasn't gonna even call you out here, but binky insisted.
- Binky?
- Oh, you don't call him binky?
We do now.
Sheriff Hank, why don't you tell the boys what the problem's been here?
Well, it started out as simple vandalism.
Somebody's been stealing our wood from sidewalks, buildings, fence posts.
Wood thieves.
My first instinct is beavers, but I'm not willing to rule out those pesky keeper elves.
- What else do you got?
- Well, our water's been poisoned, and check this out.
There's been a stench in the air that wasn't there before.
That's funny.
I don't smell anything.
Gosh.
Cat urine.
Don't mind him.
Cat pee is Gus's kryptonite.
As a child, he was locked in a closet with the family's incontinent tabby, Mr. B. - It's a very long story.
- No, it's not.
That's the story.
Breathe through your mouth.
Since then, things have gotten more aggressive.
Stuff has been stolen, misplaced, destroyed.
And folks are starting to get nervous.
And it's my job to protect them.
Drop your weapon and come peaceably.
Well, sheriff, I ain't exactly a peaceful man.
- Holy crap.
- He shot that guy.
I know.
Isn't it great?
This is not a real town.
It's a tourist trap.
Psych 403 "High Noon-ish" Timing: Psych Team Listen closely 'cause I'm gonna only say this once.
Old Sonora is an old historic mining town with buildings recreated to capture the spirit of the old west.
I spent every weekend of my childhood in this beloved place, and I am not about to let some faceless coward who only comes out at night tear it down.
I need you two to find out who's doing this and fast.
All right.
Count on us.
I knew I could.
Here's your bedrolls.
Good luck.
- We're sleeping here?
- Well, it happens at night, - so you have to stay here at night.
- What about you?
Are you kidding?
I can't be caught investigating here.
Do you know how far out of my jurisdiction we are?
- See you later, Hank.
- Thanks for your help, binky.
You got it.
I'll check back with you in the morning.
Wait, so you expect me to stay here the entire night?
Binky!
Come back.
I hope you boys like beans.
If this turns into Blazing Saddles, I'm out of here.
- Pull that.
- Stop.
Tell me, Hank Have you ever seen this vandal?
I've felt 'em.
Was that in an appropriate way?
I felt their presence.
I see.
Can you think of any other explanation for why this town is falling apart?
Are you talking about the ghost rider?
What do you mean by ghost rider?
According to the legends, he was a horse thief that met his fate at the end of a rope.
They say his spirit still haunts these parts.
Now I, myself, don't cater to this tale, no matter how many people out here see him.
- I'm out of here.
I'm calling a cab.
- Those things don't work out here.
We got no TVs, no radio, no refrigerators.
Sounds like prison, except they have all those things.
Would you stop it?
How long have you known binky, Hank?
Used to come here every weekend.
His pa wasn't around that much, and his ma worked days, so she dropped him off Saturdays.
I guess he needed somebody.
I suppose I did too.
We've been close ever since.
In fact, he's about the nearest thing I got to family.
I didn't know that about Lassie's papa.
His pa wasn't around much, Gus.
What are you doing?
You hear that?
Something's spooking the horses.
What the hell are we doing?
I don't know, Gus.
I think I'm starting to get why Lassie loves this place so much.
It represents a simpler time when people weren't so preoccupied with the distractions of modern life.
Like living past age 40.
All right, you be your cynical self.
I'm just saying.
Technology is way overrated.
That's interesting.
Yesterday you told me you intend - on having your wedding in space.
- And that hasn't changed.
I'm just saying I think the past is also worth preserving.
Your people have a much affectionate memory of this period of history than my people do.
What are you talking about?
We saw Posse together in theaters.
I want to go home.
Yeah, that's fair.
Here's how it's gonna go.
We're gonna tell Hank his town's old and decrepit, and he should be glad it didn't fall down ten years ago.
There is no saboteur, no vandal, no bad guy.
At the worst, he has a terrible cat problem.
- Watch your feet!
- Watch my feet?
- I'm leading the way.
- Your stride is too long, Shawn.
It's your ridiculous gait.
That's the problem.
No, your shoes are too large.
What?
Don't panic.
- There's no Hank.
- No horses.
What is that sound?
Look out!
- Bring him in.
- I don't believe this.
I sent you two out there to find out what the heck's going on, and you get sheriff Hank run over by horses?
First of all, I don't even know how to get someone run over.
And as long as we're assigning blame, the horses shouldn't get off scot-free.
We feel terrible about this, even it was Hank who left us there all alone.
You're lucky he didn't get killed.
I don't want him bleeding all over my couch.
There you go.
Easy.
- That's better.
- He should be in an emergency room.
- No hospitals.
- He doesn't believe in 'em.
Says the only way he's ever gonna go in one is feet-first.
Come here.
Let's put it up here.
Let's take a look.
Guys, this is deep.
This man has got to see a doctor.
I don't even have anything to numb the pain.
That's okay.
I don't believe in anesthetics.
Gus, just bite down on my big toe.
It'll make me forget about the pain in my leg.
I'm not.
Damn it, Gus, when a man asks you to bite his toe, you bite his toe.
- You do it.
- Drink this.
Much obliged.
Hank, I just want to say on behalf of Gus and I, thank you very much for saving our lives.
I'm the sheriff.
That's what I'm paid for.
Technically, you're not a real sheriff, and when you say "they", you mean you, being that you own the town, which isn't really a town.
- Why?
- Just hurry up and do this, will ya?
I got to open them gates by 9:00.
Pal, you're not going anywhere for quite a while even if I do get this sewn up.
Old Sonora hasn't closed in 45 years and it ain't gonna close today.
Spencer, come here.
With everything that's been going on out there now finding this dead body, the county wants to shut down Old Sonora which means not only will a place that teaches children lessons from a simpler time be lost forever, but sheriff Hank will be left destitute, and I will not let that happen.
Don't worry, binky.
I already have a plan.
All right, everybody, take a good look.
Keep looking.
Drink it in.
Like a bottle of laudanum.
- There a point to this?
- There's a point.
This.
There's a new sheriff in town, guys.
It's me.
It's just for a couple days.
We all know how we feel about old Hank.
The man loves beans.
So I'll be helping out after the accident last night.
And don't worry.
I'm not gonna go changing too much about the way things work around here.
At least - not right away.
- Maybe after lunch.
I would like the opportunity to sit down with each of you, ask a few probing questions, and Get to know you a little better.
We can do that later.
They're not very helpful, are they?
- How about I wear the spurs?
- How about the sheriff wears the spurs?
How about you kiss my blacksmith ass?
That was county.
They got an I.D. on the body outside of Old Sonora.
- He's a Santa Barbara resident.
- Yes, that is awesome!
That's gonna at least get us some sort of access to this case.
- I'm calling the county sheriff.
- It gets a little more strange.
What, he's a hobo, a drifter, a psycho with a longstanding grudge against beloved childhood institutions?
He's a multimillionaire businessman.
Frank McBain.
Got a house up on the hill.
Been missing for a few days.
Wife thought he was on a business trip.
All right, so let's figure out what he was doing wandering alone in the hills of Old Sonora in sneakers and shorts.
In the meantime, I'm gonna call a buddy of mine who's a county judge, get a warrant for McBain's office.
The McBain homicide is a county case.
The chief made it very clear - you are not to get involved.
- Damn it, whose side are you on?
I am just following jurisdictional protocol like you taught me to do.
Sometimes there are exceptions.
Look at this.
All of the acreage around Old Sonora has been purchased by McBain, which means the only land that he doesn't own is Hank's.
And Hank will never sell.
- What's this?
- That's the new toll road.
This road's supposed to run ten miles south of here.
Not necessarily.
The council hasn't made its final vote yet.
So what did McBain know that we don't?
McBain wanted Old Sonora.
And he would do anything to get it, including wrecking the town, tryingto shut it down, now getting Hank run over by horses.
We solved it!
Detective Lassiter and O'Hara, you remember sheriff Becker from the county sheriff's office.
Sheriff Becker just informed me that you have been sticking your noses into his investigation, which I recall specifically telling you not to do.
We have cause, chief.
We believe McBain was using vandalism to run a cherished local institution out of business.
The name of this cherished local institution wouldn't happen to be Old Sonora?
That's neither here nor there.
The fact is we have blown this case wide open.
Well, I hope you have some solid evidence to support those accusations.
Of course.
It's obvious why McBain wanted the land.
He's building a mass transit system in association with the new toll road.
Probably at taxpayers' expense, the heartless bastard.
That's a kiddie railroad.
It's a free park that McBain is donating to the county.
Here's the permit.
He's calling it the ashley baird park.
He's not even naming it after his wife.
This woman is probably his mistress, which makes him a two-timer.
Ashley Baird.
Wasn't she the little girl who had leukemia?
She was so brave.
Okay, chief, maybe I jumped the gun a little bit here, but this McBain is one bad hombre, you got to believe me.
And we can consider this vandalism case completely closed.
- There's a few loose ends to tie up.
- Vandalis We're talking about murder!
And now we got a prime suspect.
You don't.
What are you talking about?
The person who owns Old Sonora who wouldn't sell.
That's not possible.
Dang it, Hank, why didn't you tell me about Frank McBain?
You watch your language, binky, and who the hell is Frank McBain?
He's been trying to buy your land for the last two years.
Hank, you cannot keep this kind of information from us.
We are killing ourselves trying to find who may want to hurt you, and you leave a prime suspect off the table?
No, the only folks trying to buy my land is the Sweetwater Land corp.
I'll bet McBain used dummy corporations to make the purchases.
It keeps prices from skyrocketing when investors see what's going on.
It's a good thing she's pretty.
Now Sweetwater Land don't want to hurt me.
They sent me two letters six months ago.
I politely declined, and I never heard from 'em again.
Are you sure?
'cause McBain's secretary said he'd already been out to Old Sonora three times this month alone.
I never spoke to the man.
Then who did?
What the hell is going on here?
This is called 19-card stud.
Regular poker's too complicated.
It makes it easier to get pairs.
Plus, anything with a picture's wild.
Why aren't you two out interviewing suspects or feeling the walls or whatever it is you do?
At least do something.
Man, I tried.
I did.
These people are kind of mean.
It's a tough racket being sheriff.
Besides, I got to go gun down that stinky feet fellow in about 20 minutes.
- Stinky Pete.
- You wouldn't understand.
- You've never killed a man.
- Yes, I have.
But you've never pretend-killed one.
Repeatedly.
- Struggle with it every time.
- Two times now.
- Both times.
- While you were sitting here playing cowboys and indians Just cowboys.
Injuns is offensive.
- I didn't say injuns, Guster.
- That's what I heard.
- Me too.
- Would you just shut up?
Hank has managed to become our number one suspect.
McBain wanted his land, and he was talking to somebody here.
You two need to find out who it was.
- You were thinking today?
- A man's life is on the line.
Get out there, and get me a lead.
Man's all hopped up on cactus juice.
Let's start at the saloon.
Little lady.
- What are you doing?
- Exactly what it looks like.
Hee-yaw now.
Really?
It's stinky feet!
- He's trying to bushwhack us!
- Bushwhack us?
That's not stinky Pete.
He's a tourist.
I think you're right about that.
Sorry about that, friend.
Man in my line of work can't afford to be too careful.
I'm sure you understand.
Hello, Miss Annie.
I'd appreciate it if you'd refer to me as sheriff Spencer Or hickory pot.
Or dry gulch slim.
Any of those would do me just fine.
- That's not gonna happen.
- Fair enough.
- How long have you been doing this?
- About a decade.
Five years here.
Before that at Disneyland.
- They have madams at Disneyland?
- No, I worked the teacups.
I'll bet you did.
I'm gonna have to ask you a couple of uncomfortable-type questions about Hank.
- You mean that we were lovers?
- You no.
Not not that uncomfortable, no.
He broke my heart.
But that was a long time ago.
Ancient history.
Hey, there.
You the one that plays deputy sheriff Tripsy, is that right?
That's what it says on my paycheck if I still get one.
Sounds like you're not too happy with your job right now.
Maybe you're angry enough to take it out on your boss Hank.
Maybe you poisoned the water so that you could have Old Sonora all to yourself.
Maybe even enough to kill for it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
And as far as Hank goes, I love the man like a brother.
Please.
That's what everyone says.
- Who's everyone?
- Miss Annie.
She doesn't love him like a brother.
Definitely not like a brother.
Unless they have a really weird family.
They got some serious flowers up in that attic.
- You know what I mean.
- How would I know that?
Dude, he was there before the horses trampled Hank.
Not so fast there, Tripsy.
You see, we know that you were at the corral the other night.
And just for the record, your nickname is extremely offensive.
So I was up there.
Something spooked the horses, and I went up to check on 'em.
And I caught a glimpse of whoever it was too.
And then he vanished.
You're trying to tell us it was the ghost rider who tried to kill Hank?
Please.
- I don't like your tone, mister.
- Is that right?
'cause I've been told it's quite soothing.
- Try to stay on point.
- I think you're lying, Tripsy.
It was you who spooked the horses because you knew dag gum well that Hank would come running.
That's a lie!
I love Hank Mendel.
Get the county sheriff office on the phone.
You tell 'em we found ourselves the vandal and that he might have just killed McBain too.
Okay, boys.
I didn't see nobody.
But something spooked the horses, and it wasn't me, I swear.
Yeah, I was up there.
It was for a different reason.
I was working for McBain.
Go on.
He was paying me to make a list of all the safety violations we got around this place.
And he was gonna use 'em to force the county to shut us down.
After that, Hank would have no choice but to sell to McBain.
And you say he was like a brother to you.
I ain't proud of what I done, mister.
Are there any other employees still here?
When Hank's not around, I'm always the last one to leave.
Is that the Ghost rider.
He must have gone in there.
That's completely sealed.
There's no way he got through there.
Unless he can move through solids, which, by definition, he can.
Really?
We have to have that conversation?
Fine.
Maybe the guy on the horse is not a ghost.
And let's say he is the vandal, which doesn't even make sense, because the guy who wanted the land is dead.
Even so, there's still something we haven't taken into account yet.
What's that?
What if McBain's murder is related to something else?
Or just a random act of violence?
I'll go even further.
What if the guy on the horse is not vandalizing the town?
What if no one is?
You said it yourself, Shawn.
What if this place is so rundown from neglect and old age that it's falling apart, huh?
I see your point.
A ghost?
Maybe a ghost.
Definitely not a ghost.
But a ghost-like fella.
- An ethereal moonlight figure.
- Who might be able to go through rocks.
But probably not.
I sent you out there to investigate for 2 days, and all you come back with is campfire stories?
- Gus got the consumption.
- I did what's going on in here?
Costume party.
And this wouldn't have anything to do with the Old Sonora, would it?
Sorry, which one's Old Sonora again?
You know, I don't want to hear it, detective.
And if I find out that you hired Spencer and Guster on your own, that constitutes a conflict of interest and there will be disciplinary measures.
I highly recommend that you stick to your assigned cases.
Gee, thanks for hopping in there and taking some of the heat from the chief.
- You're very welcome.
- I was being facetious.
You wimped out.
If you believe the short-sided pundits on CNN, - but I take a longer view of history.
- That doesn't even make any sense.
The coroner's report said McBain's been dead for five days.
Yet the vandalism hasn't stopped since then.
Therefore, we can effectively eliminate McBain.
I'm now sensing that someone else wants that land.
McBain's got the kind of money that's tough to beat.
As a result, he or she Or even a he-she.
had to kill McBain before he got it.
He was eliminating the competition.
Precisely.
Yeah, maybe.
And when I find this murdering scum, I'm gonna shoot him in the face.
Not entirely.
That's all just wishful thinking.
We don't have the vaguest clue.
No thanks to you Spencer.
So far you've given me bubkes.
Get back out there, and get to work.
- He just said - Bubkes.
The thing is, you never have to wonder why Lassie doesn't have more friends.
What are you doing here, man?
You should be resting.
You didn't come back for the spurs, did you?
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving town.
- Why?
- Well, I been licked.
Whole buildings are starting to fall.
Better I just move on and forget the whole damn thing.
I admit, it's a long shot, but there's still a chance that we could save Old Sonora.
I've seen the park they want to build.
It's a nice place.
And I believe that folks are gonna want to go there.
I'm an old relic.
I've known that for a long time.
Hank, we can fix the buildings.
We'll just get some nails.
And febreze.
Fellas, that sounds awful good, but no, it's too late.
I've already contacted the folks over at Sweetwater Land and accepted their offer.
Old Tripsy, he's gonna handle the last show.
Me, I'm done.
I guess that's that.
This list of possible suspects is garbage.
Detectives, a moment.
Now.
Look, chief, if this is about the Chief, I just want to say that I am whatsoever that I have done anything even remotely Old Sonora-related in the last two hours.
Sheriff Becker would like to formally invite you into the McBain case.
Thank god, 'cause I was totally lying just then.
- Sheriff, what can I do for ya?
- Just received the ballistics report.
The guys in our lab said they've never seen a slug a slug like the one they pulled out of McBain, and well, I thought because of your expertise with firearms maybe you could help identify it.
They've never seen a bullet like this 'cause it's over 100 years old.
What kind of a gun uses a slug like that?
An original 1873 Colt peacemaker.
You sure this is all you got, Hank?
I mean, we're good on space.
We can grab you a wagon wheel.
Or that barrel.
- I need to see your pistol.
- Why do you need to see that?
You don't think Hank had anything to do with McBain's death?
- Don't be crazy.
Come on.
- Shawn, stay out of this.
Your gun.
Slowly.
Why you been firing live rounds?
I saw a rat, and I shot it.
Hank Mendel, you're under arrest for the murder of Frank McBain.
Come on.
Read him his rights, O'Hara.
You have the right to remain silent Why do people that I try to help usually end up getting arrested?
Sometimes people you think are innocent turn out to be guilty and vice versa.
The important thing is, how will you help me get his blood out of my couch?
Hank is innocent.
- Yeah, can you prove it?
- Not yet.
You wanna know what I think?
No, I just came by for one of your inedible, fat-free grilled cheese sandwiches.
Yes, I'd like to know what you think.
Lassiter is so emotionally invested in trying to save this town, you, in trying to help him, have developed some of the same feelings and desires.
It's a simple case of transference.
You don't use words like transference.
Have you been secretly hanging out with mom?
We may or may not have dined together last week.
The point is, your judgment in this case is being clouded by your emotions.
Dined together?
You're David Niven now?
That's your new thing?
You think Hank is innocent, go back to Old Sonora and get a proof, but this time, don't look at the town as this magical place that means so much to Lassiter.
Instead, look at it for what it really is.
A dump that probably isn't worth saving.
We've been looking for over an hour.
I need a break.
There's gotta be a logical explanation for where they disappeared to.
I've got one for you.
The next dimension.
Really, Winston Zeddmore?
That's what you believe, huh?
I haven't slept in two days, Shawn.
I don't know what I believe.
What?
What do you see?
I'm not sure.
I think I broke my back.
And my neck.
And my arm.
That's nothing.
I just bruised my coccyx.
- Say what?
- You know what I mean.
I most certainly do not.
When I get home, I'm gonna have to rub oil on my coccyx.
- Oh, Gus, please.
- That's disgusting.
What?
A deep-tissue massage is definitely what my coccyx needs.
- Would you stop saying that word?
- Coccyx?
That's what it's called, Shawn.
Dude this must be a part of the old mine shaft.
It's no wonder it's not on the tour.
It's completely unauthentic.
Look at this.
Look at these tools.
- They're all modern.
- It looks like they're being used.
Let me see the light.
Dude.
What?
Are you kidding me?
That's what this whole thing is about?
Copper?
That's gold, Shawn.
Oh, I guess that would make more sense.
So I was right.
Old Sonora was never being vandalized.
At least not deliberately.
Clearly, I agree with you.
I just don't know why.
The theft and damage on the surface can be explained by the fact that mining is going on underground.
The stolen wood posts are being used to prop up the shaft.
The contaminated water and the sinkholes are common side effects of shaft mining.
The foul odor in the air is from the exposed sulfur deposits.
The only thing I don't understand is, why would a ghost be mining for gold?
It wasn't a ghost, Gus.
Then who is it?
It was the other gunfighter.
That stinky feet guy.
The name is stinky Pete.
Hold up!
Hold up!
Hank.
We tested your gun.
It doesn't match the slug.
I told you it wasn't me, Binky, but you don't want to listen no more.
Hank, I'm so sorry.
I never should have The murder weapon's most likely an identical twin to yours.
Well, actually, I think my gun might have been part of a set.
It was so long ago, I'd forgotten.
Do you have any idea who may have the other one?
As a matter of fact, I do.
How you doing over there?
Now I have a throbbing headache and a throbbing coccyx.
What?
Who are you really?
I'm a psychic.
And I can see everything very clearly now.
Just like Tripsy, you were on McBain's payroll.
When you went looking for safety violations, you decided to check out the old mine shaft, and, as dumb luck would have it, you found yourself a previously undiscovered vein of gold.
What's more, you were the rider that we saw last night.
Pulling wood into the entrance of the mine, which only appeared to be sealed.
'cause neither Hank nor anyone else thought to check if the rocks were actually real.
I got to hand it to you, Pete.
It was quite a nifty operation you had going here.
Still do.
Unfortunately, McBain got what he needed to ensure that hank would fail the upcoming safety inspection so Old Sonora had to close down.
When McBain took ownership out of foreclosure, it wouldn't take long for his crew to discover your gold strike, so to slow things down and give yourself more time to mine, well, you went ahead and killed McBain.
I could deny it, but then there ain't much point, is there?
There's more than a million dollars' gold in here.
Not only are you a murderer, but you're a thief.
This gold belongs to Hank, a man who's been more than fair and generous with all of his employees, including yourself.
Well, I guess after playing a bad guy all these years, the line between actor and role got kind of blurred.
They say the same thing happened to Yul Brynner.
This is not good.
Dude, what are you doing?
It worked for Tim Robbins in Shawshank Redemption, Shawn.
Get busy living or get busy dying.
Gus, we don't have years to dig a tunnel.
Besides, it makes me Morgan Freeman.
That's weird.
Wait a minute.
That's water.
Dude, give me the pickaxe.
Watch yourself.
You see what I see?
Stop pushing, Shawn.
Dude, this tunnel's only big enough for one person.
Pete Dillingham!
You're under arrest for the murder of Frank McBain.
Throw your weapon down and come peacefully.
How can you tell which one's the bad guy if they're both wearing black?
I'm the good guy, you toothless hillbillies.
Though I did just shoot that man for real, so clear on out.
Well, the great news is, with all the money you'll make from selling gold, you can fix up Old Sonora, restore it to its former glory.
I don't know, Binky.
I've been thinking maybe it's time this old cowboy hung up his spurs.
I guess I could take comfort in the fact that I've lasted this long.
Well, and that you're about to be filthy rich.
Well, that too.
I'm gonna miss this place.
Hank, you been a damn good friend to me.
You've been more than a friend.
Yeah, them are hard to come by these days.
Now if you'll excuse me, I got myself a wayward and wild woman to ask to marry me.
What?
Look at that.
She's about to give up the world's oldest profession.
She was never a real madam, Shawn.
You do know that.
Agree to disagree.
By the way, you ever call me Binky again, I'll shoot you.
Understood.
How about once more, just for old times' sake?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
- Thanks for coming in, Henry.
- Of course, father.
Of course.
I wanted to discuss Shawn's attitude in Sunday school lately.
I can't get through a lecture without him questioning every detail.
Take this morning's, for instance, on Noah's ark.
I'm sorry, dad.
But it doesn't make sense.
What doesn't make sense, Shawn?
Lots of things.
Like if the ark was built in the Middle East, how did animals like the koala bear get to it?
God helped them get there using his almighty power.
That's exactly right, Gus.
Then why didn't he use those powers to create the ark?
Wouldn't that be much faster than getting Noah to build it?
Because god prefers his creations accomplish things on their own.
Unless those creations happen to be koala bears, right?
Shawn, I think you're getting a little too hung up on the details.
Really?
You've always taught me that details are everything in life.
- You're missing the point.
- How'd they keep all the lions from eating all the zebras?
Don't you think that the seven lions would have gone through at least seven zebras by then?
They could have easily eaten seven zebras by then.
Lions eat close to 5,000 pounds of meat a year.
Why don't we break this down?
What have we got here?
We've got Noah, we got a boatload full of animals.
What would be his M.O.?
This is not a detective case, Henry.
This is Have you two ever considered visiting the methodist church down the street?
It's quite nice.
Agatha!
- Wait!
- Get away!
Get Stay back!
No, don't come any closer to me.
Stay back.
Come down.
I wanna help you.
How come you're so quiet?
- 'Cause I'm mad at you.
- What?
How come?
How come?
Really?
Does this conversation sound familiar?
"Hey, Gus, you wanna go to the beach today"?
"Are you sure you don't wanna check out that jumper over at Saint Attalus"?
"It sounds like a straightforward suicide to me.
Are you peeing"?
"No, Shawn, I'm doing the dishes".
"Sounds like you're peeing, excuse me".
The nozzle was on spray mode.
And Shawn, I do not talk like that.
"Shawn, maybe we should stop by Saint Attalus just to be sure.
"Besides, there'll be all kinds of hotties "running around in catholic school girl uniforms".
What?
Question Where are all the girls in the catholic school girl uniforms?
- There's one right over there.
- No, that is a male bagpiper.
- Why is this case so important to you?
- It happens to be intriguing to me.
Besides, I'm here to see an old friend.
You randy little spaniel.
Why didn't you just say so?
Dude, you know I love playing wingman.
Just point her out, we'll get this party started tonight!
- Father Westley?
- Hello, gus.
Scratch the wingman thing, man, I'm out.
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.
- Been a long time.
- Yes, it has.
You remember Shawn Spencer, don't you?
How could I forget?
He's my favorite little skeptic.
- My friends call me "skepty".
- No.
- They will.
- I was happy when you moved back here.
Well, you and I both.
I was right in the midst of shoveling five inches of snow off my driveway in Buffalo.
When I got the call offering me the position here.
I can't believe you have become detectives.
Psychic detectives to be exact.
Actually, he's the psychic, I'm a pharmaceutical salesman.
- We also do commercial jingles.
- No.
We will.
Muffins.
- That's incredible.
- Thanks, I made it up just now.
- It's about the detective thing.
- That too.
Can you tell us about the tragedy that occurred here last night?
If you two don't mind, - we're asking questions.
- If one of them is, "do the female students wear catholic school girl uniforms"?
The answer to that is no.
Stay.
Father.
What else can you tell us about the deceased?
Agatha was a model student.
Hard-working, well-liked, outgoing.
Then about three weeks ago something changed.
She became extremely short tempered, emotionally unstable.
Almost manic.
None of us knew what it was.
There was no history of mental illness and her friends say she never touched drugs or alcohol.
Was she a fan of the game Grand Theft Auto?
I know when I play, I become raving mad, foaming at the mouth.
- I had to taser him once.
- Which I still feel was excessive.
St. Attalus doesn't allow video games.
They don't allow school girl uniforms, either.
- Will you stop?
- No.
Will you just stop it?
Excuse us for a moment.
Detective - You know what I think?
- What?
- I think she was - You're wrong.
I'm sorry, I jumped the gun on that.
Please continue.
- I think she was murdered.
- Are you finished?
You're wrong.
My senses are telling me that this girl committed suicide.
Well you can tell your senses to kiss my sweet Love biscuits.
I don't know if you made it less offensive.
Look, you have to admit there's something weird here.
I mean, a girl like Agatha doesn't just randomly go nuts and kill herself.
- There has to be an explanation.
- I have one.
Now is not the time, Peter.
I'd like to hear what he has to say.
She was possessed.
I guess my video game theory isn't looking so stupid right now.
Timing: Psych Team Psych 404 - The Devil's in the Details and in the Upstairs Bedroom So let me get this straight.
You think that she was possessed?
As in floating above the bed, head spinning, pukes up on the wall, - that sort of thing?
- That's the Hollywood version.
The real life signs of possession are often more subtle than that.
Though there have been some reports of levitation in exorcisms.
- That's true.
- You'll have to forgive father Westley, he comes from an era of the church where such beliefs were more widely accepted.
Today the majority of us view the concept of demonic possession to be a little far-fetched.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Father, you should come as well.
I'm speaking the truth.
You have to believe me.
I don't arrive at such conclusions easily.
- Father Westley.
- Yes.
- You have a little shiver over there?
- No, it's all this talk of devil and possession.
I don't scare easily, but that stuff makes me shake in my boots.
I'm talking to Vick, she wants to know if you two dopes are on the case.
Lassie, my friend, - I'm afraid the answer is a big fat - Yes.
- And by yes, he means - Absolutely.
May I speak with you in the "stop openly contradicting me" room, please?
You can tell her we'll take it.
What?
Since when do you accept a case without running it by your partner?
- You do it every week.
- That makes it right?
Shawn, I know who killed that girl.
Who?
The devil.
So, I've been thinking If we end up catching the devil, and he starts acting all devily, I know what to do.
First, I'll buy a fiddle, play a quick tune so he underestimates my ability, then I'll challenge him to a wager He wins, he gets my soul.
I win, we get his cooperation.
I get it.
You don't believe in possessions.
But I do.
Especially after I saw this police sketch of the suspect.
Last seen at the local canned ham factory.
How long did it take you to draw that?
A good half hour, but I think it sold my point.
Look, I know father Westley's theory is kind of crazy.
But if he believes it, then I need to take it seriously.
- You know how much I look up to him.
- I look up to Brett Favre.
It doesn't mean I believe everything he says.
All right, that's a bad example.
It's those tearful press conferences.
- They get me every time.
- I just wanna at least look into it.
But I can have your back on this.
I know, that's why I wanna be the lead investigator.
- Since when do we have titles?
- Since you ordered business cards that say, "Shawn Spencer, lead investigator".
No, silly.
It's "lead Leadinvestigators".
A business I was thinking of starting after we watched Erin Brockovich.
- Okay fine.
- Thank you.
You're the lead.
- I'm in the back seat.
- Thank you.
Yeah, come in.
Come on in, boys.
Let me get another look at you two, huh?
You two haven't changed a bit.
Have a seat, boys.
You know, I want to apologize for earlier on.
You know, father Bard, like a lot of the younger members of the church isn't very tolerant towards views that he doesn't agree with.
I actually want to ask you about that.
What was it about Agatha that made you think she was possessed?
Well, her extreme change of personality for one.
And that, coupled with the fact that I learned that she'd been dabbling in the occult.
According to a friend, she had been conducting seances and using Ouija boards.
Both of which can be used as calling cards of sorts for demonic spirits.
Just for the record, father, I use Ouija boards all the time when I was a kid.
And never once was I pos You're gonna die up there.
Come on, man, it's a line from the movie.
If Agatha was possessed, why didn't you - or someone else perform an exorcism?
- Believe me, I tried.
But I had to get the approval of the headmaster who happens to be father bard.
And he said no, of course.
I could have prevented her death.
That's an interesting theory, father.
But isn't it possible - Back seat.
- Agatha was a disturbed young girl?
- Back seat.
- Shawn, believe me, I've dealt with enough disturbed people to know the difference.
Look, I understand how this may seem a bit illogical to you, but trust me, possessions are real.
They're real.
I can personally attest to it.
This thing.
Come on.
Let me know when you're ready to bail on the possessed theory, because I actually have a real idea for why Agatha was acting crazy.
There will be no bailing.
I just found these articles online about father Westley.
Did you know he's one of the foremost experts on demonic possession in USA?
He performed a bunch of high profile exorcisms in the '70s, including this one in Peru, which lasted over a month.
I remember reading about it as a kid.
In what?
This never actually happened magazine?
You mock, but check this out.
- Agatha's page.
- You friended a dead person.
No, I figured out her password and logged on.
Let me guess.
She's kind of gothy, so it's probably something like "bauhaus" - or "siouxsie" with an "x".
- Her birthday.
No, that's too obvious.
"Bjork"?
- The password is her birthday.
- Bravo for knowing Bjork's birthday.
Her own birthday.
Will you check this out?
Look at her status updates from 3 weeks ago.
Notice how they're all cheery?
"Agatha is loving Santa Barbara ".
"Agatha played with the cutest puppy".
- I bet it was a labradoodle.
- You know that's right.
Look here now, the next day, they completely change.
"Agatha is over everybody!
Agatha just wants to be left alone".
That is when she became possessed.
Or - may I go now?
- Go ahead.
Or, that is precisely when she started having man trouble, come on.
What are you talking about?
She was wearing a sweatshirt that was at least a double XL.
That means she either spent a few hours in one of those cartoon steam boxes that shrinks you a few sizes, or it belonged to her boyfriend.
So why don't we check her photos - and find out?
- Go ahead.
Man, how come every girl posts, like, a million photos online of her and friends posing cheek to cheek?
It's so lame.
Says the guy who has that on his desk.
It's not posted online, gus.
Yet.
Boring.
Boring.
I give you Agatha's boyfriend.
What's your name, smoochie?
Well, hello, Cameron.
We don't know that they were having trouble.
Really?
Wednesday, the 5th: "Agatha is pissy at her boyfriend".
"Agatha's tired of all the drama".
And the 14th: "Agatha is now single".
That last one was two days before she died.
I'll give you two possible scenarios.
One, Cameron dumped Agatha, and she threw herself off a building in despair.
Or two, Agatha dumped Cameron, he pushed her off the building in a fit of rage.
Both of which are far more plausible than the devil going down to Santa Barbara.
- Where are you going?
- We are going to talk to Cameron.
I'm going to crack this thing.
But first, I'm gonna need my leadinvestigator title back.
Thank you.
- What was her major?
- It's Christian studies.
Christian studies.
Unbelievable.
Lassie has now beaten us to a suspect.
I'm afraid history will not look too kindly on your tenure as leadinvestigator.
Hey, kids, - what did we miss?
- This is Agatha's ex-boyfriend.
Let me guess.
Your name is Cameron.
- That's right.
- You guys broke up two days ago.
- And you weigh a solid 225.
- You're about 50 pounds off.
I got greedy.
Sorry to hear about the breakup.
Those can be tough.
Let me guess, you dumped her, but she wouldn't accept it?
Agatha was the one that broke up with me.
I was willing to make it work.
Where were you last night when she jumped?
I was in the desert at Burning Man.
I hope you can prove that, buddy.
Well, it looks like you guys got this one covered.
Gus and I are going to throw back shots and hit the confessional booth.
The dude's alibi is good.
There was a backpack and shoes covered in sand from Burning Man.
Excuse me, are you the grief counselors?
As a matter of fact we are, Mary.
- How did you know that was my name?
- Just a hunch.
How's Cameron doing?
We're all really worried about him.
It's tough.
He's hanging in there.
I think he'll feel much better once the medication kicks in.
- He's on medication?
- No, I am.
Just an antacid.
Is there anyone else you can think of who's taking the news of Agatha's death particularly hard?
Family or close friends?
You know about Lucy?
Yes, of course.
She charges, what, five cents for psychiatric help.
And if she ever asks you to kick a football, you say no.
We don't know about Lucy.
She was one of Agatha's best friends.
She saw the whole thing happen.
Agatha died in her arms.
Really?
You wouldn't happen to know where we could find this Lucy?
Hello, Mrs. Ryan.
My name is Shawn, this is Shawn.
No relation.
We're grief counselors from the school.
Thank God.
Please come in.
I'm sorry, I thought you were just another pair of detectives.
There were detectives here earlier?
Yes, two by the name O'Hara and Lassiter.
- Dude, you're on fire.
- They didn't get much.
Lucy was really withdrawn.
You two couldn't have come at a better time.
It's like she's a shell of her former self.
Do you think she has PTSD?
I'm afraid this is far more serious than a mere menstrual issue.
It could be post traumatic stress disorder.
But we won't know for sure until we talk with her.
In private, if you don't mind.
Of course.
Please, go on up Her room is the first left at the top of the stairs.
Can I get either of you something?
A diet coke, some garlic hummus, and the new Tv Guide, if you have it.
Mrs. Ryan, is your daughter by any chance an expert yogi?
Or an olympic gymnast, perhaps?
No, why?
There's no particular reason.
Hey, Lucy.
That was some pretty sweet spider walking.
We were hoping you could shed some light on what happened last night.
Die.
We heard you lost your best friend.
That's terrible.
We're so sorry.
Both of you die.
There's something wrong with her.
She just saw her best friend kill herself.
Imagine how you'd be if you saw me torn apart by a pride of angry lions.
I'm having second thoughts about our spring safari trip.
Hear me out.
Agatha jumped off to kill herself and the demon that was inside of her.
Right before she died, the demon transferred out of her and into Lucy.
- Just like in The Exorcist.
- You're basing this on a fiction.
You once tried to solve a case using the movie Pretty In Pink.
That's completely different, Pretty In Pink is more of a docu-drama.
All right, fine, let's say she is possessed.
How come she isn't projectile vomiting and spouting stuff in languages that she doesn't know?
You mean like that?
How many foreign languages does your daughter speak?
Just french.
In your fudge.
She was speaking german.
- How do you know that?
- I went to college.
Lucy, please calm down.
Admit it, the only reason why you won't accept possession as a real possibility is because Father Westley came up with it.
- You've always had a problem with him.
- I don't have a problem with him.
He has a problem.
Because I have the ability to see things in more than one way.
You clearly can't see things objectively right now.
That's it, I'm taking back over as lead investigator.
Sorry, buddy.
Only one title switch per investigation.
It's in the fine print on the back of my business card.
Come on, chill out, man.
I'm just messing with you.
Don't punch me, Shawn.
- That was way harder.
- Well.
- You want to do this?
- Come on.
- Right now?
- Come on.
- Come on, baby girl.
- Come on, come on.
Excuse me!
What kind of grief counselors are you?
We're very progressive.
This is an exercise that we do.
It helps us empathize with your daughter's pain.
Right, watch.
I'm now going to turn things over to the lead grief counselor, Shawn.
You're on your own.
All right.
Where's is it?
Where is my Xbox?
- Where is it?
- What are you talking about?
Dad, this is not the day to mess with me.
I can assure you of that.
I can't believe you stole this from me.
I prefer the term "repossessed," in that you reneged on our deal.
I painted your house, just like we agreed.
Minus the spots behind the bushes that no one ever sees, and the windows, and of course, the entire back.
That stays here until you're finished.
End of story.
Let me guess.
Relationship trouble?
- I hate it when we fight.
- I'm sure she feels the same way.
I'm not talking about Abigail, I mean Gus.
So am I. I was starting to make some progress on this case we're working on, and he refuses to let go of this ridiculous theory that he has.
Do you remember my ex-partner, Stevie?
There was this one time when Stevie was convinced that break-ins was being committed by an ape who had escaped from the zoo.
I thought he had lost his mind.
But I went down the road with him on it.
And it turned out to be a good move, you know why?
I don't know.
Headlines?
"Cops stop monkey business: criminals go bananas"?
I'm trying to make a point here.
The point is it turned out to be a good move because from that point on Stevie always supported my ideas.
You get your partner's back, Shawn.
Even if it means putting your doubts aside for a minute.
What are you doing here?
I came back to help my partner.
Thanks, buddy.
But I already called someone.
Who?
I appreciate you keeping an open mind about this.
No problem, buddy.
Tell me if this girl turns out to be possessed and the whole exorcism thing works Where does that leave us?
It's over, we know why Agatha killed herself.
Right.
Now when it doesn't work I'm sorry, if it doesn't work you promise me that we can go back to doing things my way?
- And what way is that again?
- You know, follow a few leads, make some inappropriate jokes, I'll remember and then we'll tip off the police using a little bit of this.
- You got it.
- All right.
I want both you boys in there with me in the event she needs to be restrained.
Have either one of you ever been involved in an exorcism?
You need to be strong in there.
Understand?
All right, let's bring it in.
- This isn't a ball game, boys.
- You.
I always try to start with a little humor.
Check this one out.
A priest, a rabb It's over now.
Let's go.
Now.
Right now.
Demons will do everything in their power to keep from getting expelled.
And their powers are great.
And they know everything about us Facts, dreams, inner desires.
And they won't hesitate to use them against you.
What's going on?
We're here to help.
But I don't need any help.
I'm fine.
See that?
She's fine.
Great work.
- Who's up for some fro-yo?
- She's lying to get us to leave.
If I woke up and there were two dudes and a priest standing over me, I'd lie too.
Holy water.
- In the name of the Father, the Son - Stop it!
Stop it!
the Holy Ghost Hold her down.
Now!
Hold her down.
You're okay, you're okay.
You're hot.
Thank you.
You're not so bad yourself.
Maybe a little Well, young.
She's using lies to distract you.
Well, it's not fair to assume she's lying.
Silence!
Be gone, Satan!
Inventor and master of all deceit, - be gone!
- All right, you know what?
Carson D.'s got Simon Baker on tonight.
That's a can't-miss, okay?
I'm gonna go, you can keep exorcisizing.
I know about Mr. Reno.
What did you say?
He was your seventh grade shop teacher.
You placed a tack on his chair.
How did you Did you tell her that?
You're the one who gave him blood poisoning.
- No, we don't know that for sure.
- Get him out of here, Gus.
The man made a living handling rusty metals.
Father Westley, what in God's name is going on in here?
Good luck, guys.
You sure you didn't say anything to her about Mr. Reno?
Stay here.
It's okay.
The most high God commands you!
Nomine patris, et filii, et spiritus sancti Double whoa.
It's over.
She's clean.
- How's she doing?
- She's exhausted and a bit confused.
I have to say, she really seems like her old self.
I can't thank you all enough.
It's Father Westley who deserves the credit.
I was just doing the Lord's work.
Thank you, Father.
There has to be an explanation for why Agatha was acting nuts.
- Tell me you have something there.
- I wish.
Her toxicology report just came back negative.
Are you getting a premonition?
No, just a head rush.
Happens to me quite a bit when I'm sleep deprived.
Spencer, you're wrong about this one.
That girl was murdered.
- That's not humanly possible.
- And how come?
- Because you think she was murdered.
- I guess we'll see.
- We will see.
- We'll see.
I just said that.
Boys.
So, if she had any drug in her system, it would show up on this report?
No, just the ones they test for.
The standard narcotics, why?
Do you have a specific drug in mind?
Not yet.
bursts of energy.
Hey, Gus.
What is up?
Why are you sitting at my desk?
Just working on my status updates.
Check this one out "Shawn Spencer is trading in his Chevy "for a Cadillac-a-lac-a-lac-a-lac".
Then why - Then why were you - What?
Why are you reading my index of medications?
Because it's hilarious.
The section on medications that treat urinary infections made me pee my pants.
Which is ironic if you think about it.
- You're on to something, aren't you?
- Yep.
Got to go.
Thanks for the cake.
That's a sponge to moisten stamps.
Dad?
You know I hate coming here, but I need more partner advice.
Well, this is sad.
You haven't gone to bed, have you?
I tried, but it's this game.
It keeps calling me back.
It lets you feel like a cop without all the guilt after you shoot someone.
What are you doing?
Kids your age should not be cooped up inside playing video games all day.
You should be outdoors feeding pigeons, and driving with your blinker on.
What do you want, Shawn?
You remember I asked you what you should do when you think your partner's wrong?
What do you do when you know they are?
That's simple You tell them the truth.
But in the most respectful way possible.
You were wrong.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
Finger-guns.
Wrong.
Wrong.
- Wrong on your weenie.
- Shawn, put down the finger-guns.
Agatha wasn't possessed.
She was drugged.
I saw the toxicology report, she was clean.
The preliminary report, sure.
But they don't test for everything.
I made a list of medications with psychological side effects and had them test for those as well.
And guess which one they found in her system.
L-dopa.
- The parkinson's medication?
- Correctamundo.
And do you know what happens to someone who takes L-dopa that doesn't have Parkinson's?
They experience extreme emotional states, disillusionment, and uncontrollable bursts of energy.
What's up?
Sound like anyone we know?
That doesn't explain the lamp, or how Lucy knew the German, or the tack story.
All right, in order.
The lamp The chick was flailing about, she was grabbing at everything.
The German Etcetera is a line from Run Lola Run, which according to her page is her favorite movie.
I mean, it's a nice little film, but favorite?
Really?
It ends in the middle and starts all over again Anyway, speaking of personal networking sites, I forgot that our good friend stumpy from grade school posted the following message on my page a few months back.
"Hello, Shawn.
Remember when you put that tack "on Mr. Reno's chair and gave him blood poisoning"?
Stumpy wasn't british.
My page is open for public viewing so that our potential clients can check us out.
Clearly she went onto it after we stopped by yesterday.
So, you think they were just popping Parkinson's pills?
They were being given to them secretly.
By who?
Someone with access to the medication Which brings me to the bad news.
Father Westley?
He was diagnosed ten years ago.
I'm sorry, dude.
It all checks out.
- Guess what he takes.
- L-dopa.
Every day.
No.
There's no way.
Think about it, Gus.
Back in the'70s, when disco and exorcisms were all the rage, he was the man.
Strutting around, exorcising demons in his polyester cassock.
Cut to 30 years later, and all the younger members of the church treat him like a crazy old man.
So what does he do?
He tries to create a possession to prove them all wrong.
He drugs the chick with the Ouija board.
That goes terribly awry.
He realizes he has one last chance.
When he learns that Lucy was next to her when she died.
So he makes her possessed.
I really am sorry, buddy.
- You're doing okay?
- Oh, I can't complain.
My vows of poverty and abstinence that I took 40 years ago prepared me quite well for prison life.
You believe I'm innocent, right?
I do.
But I need your help to prove it.
Do you know anyone who had access to your medication?
Well, I suppose there were a lot.
You know, I kept it in the top drawer of my desk, I rarely ever locked my office.
Do you know of anyone who may have had it out for Agatha?
Actually, someone does come to mind.
Who?
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
They revealed it to me during confession.
You can't make this exception just once?
As a man of the cloth, you know I can't.
How about a man of the orange cloth?
Your freedom is at stake here.
I have total faith that the Lord will get me through this, Gus.
Until then, I have my Bible to give me strength.
Proverbs 11:6.
It's been especially comforting to me as of late.
Time's up.
Dad?
- Is that you?
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.
But there's no reason to come down.
I'm just here I'm just here to finish up the painting.
Where have you been?
I need to talk to you.
- Now is not the best time.
- Father Westley is innocent.
What?
Someone confided in him that they had it out for Agatha.
But he can't say who it is because it was told to him during confession.
What are you saying?
You have a hunch based on unverifiable information?
That's what you use to solve every case.
Okay, that stings.
It's true, though.
What else did he say?
He did say he's been getting strength from a particular proverb.
All right, fine.
Let's do a quick list.
"You can't teach an old dog new tricks"?
"A bird in the hand's worth two in the bush"?
- "If it's brown, flush it down"?
- Shawn, proverbs 11:6.
The Bible.
- What's going on in here?
- Nothing is going on.
Where is your Bible?
I don't know.
That's a good question.
- Where did I put it?
- Gosh.
- Really?
- Here, let me see that.
All right, look, this is just a shot in the dark, but I think maybe Maybe Father Westley was trying to tell you something with the proverb that he mentioned.
Where's the table of contents in this thing?
Tell you what, you do this, I am gonna go prime the outside, 'cause I'm gonna paint!
If you leave with that bag, I will pull out my gun.
All right, do you know what?
You need help.
I know.
I know.
What's happening to me?
Okay, here it is.
"The righteousness of the upright will save them, the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires".
The unfaithful - will be trapped by evil desires.
- That's good.
- What up?
- Hello, Cameron.
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?
Unfortunately, we're here to tell you that you are under arrest for possession of an illegal hot plate.
What?
Just messing with you, man.
We were in the neighborhood.
We thought we'd come by and say hey.
Are we interrupting something?
Well, actually - What's going on?
- Put a sock on the door next time.
Lucy and I were just comforting each other.
Is that what the church is calling it these days?
You tell us what's going on?
I know who was drugging Agatha, and it wasn't Father Westley.
- You don't think it was me?
- What do you think, Lassie?
Absolutely.
Great, now I know for sure that it was Lucy.
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.
Admit it.
You wanted Cam the whole time that he and Agatha were together.
That's so not true.
Yeah, Lucy and I have always just been friends.
Cam, don't be so naive.
Men and women can't be friends.
When Harry met Sally.
It also taught us that women often fake orgasms.
Lucy, you wanted him badly.
So badly it was filling you with guilt.
So much guilt that you had to go and confess to someone in order to get it off your chest, isn't that right?
Did Father Westley tell you about that?
You just did.
I know how this movie ends.
She desperately wanted them to break up.
So she stole Father Westley's medication and secretly gave it to Agatha hoping the poor girl would act so crazy that Cameron would dump her.
But Agatha ended up dumping him, but that didn't matter.
Because Lucy got what Lucy wanted.
But there was a problem.
The medication made Agatha too crazy.
And then Lucy was trapped.
'Cause it was only a matter of time before someone uncovered your plan.
Then she overheard Father Westley's proclamation.
She was possessed.
And she figured she had the perfect thing to throw us off the trail.
Props to you for your performance as a possessed girl.
Linda Blair would be proud.
And now you can do your best impression of her inchained heat.
And?
- Red heat.
- Right.
Two prison movies!
Is this true?
I never meant to hurt her, honest.
I just knew that she wasn't right for you.
Let's go.
Okay, you're up.
Look, I'm having second thoughts about this whole confession thing.
- You promised me you'd go just once.
- I know, I know I did.
But it's Father Westley, and he knows me.
And it just It feels weird.
Trust me, you'll feel better about yourself.
Go on.
Wrong door.
Bless me father for I have sinned, it's been Carry the one That's not very priestly I don't think.
Whatever.
As far as the sinning goes, I'm a little unclear as to what's still on the list nowadays.
I'm assuming that stealing is still a no-no, right?
- That's correct.
- Okay, and then greed?
- Impure thoughts?
- Big time.
You have any place you need to be soon?
This could take a while.
Let's start with the lying.
I do it all the time.
But here's the good news: nature of my job.
Yeah, go on.
I'd rather switch over to stealing, if you don't mind.
I don't do it often, but something's been gnawing at me lately.
Gus, can you hear me?
Here's the thing, I've been stealing food that Gus hides in his desk and eating it.
And then blaming it on the cleaning lady Onelia.
I knew it!
I knew it!
Damn it.
Was that word a sin?
I'm sorry.
One thing I wasn't lying about was the commercial jingles.
Perhaps, I could help the church out with a new theme.
Boom, boom, boom wafers No, that's not it.
That's not the one.
Let me try this.
Boom, boom, boom holy ghost I like that.
Holy ghost.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
All right, Shawn, now, the most important thing about playing second base is the footwork.
- You ready?
- I was born ready, dad.
Actually, you were born breech, son.
Took hours to get you out.
Ball.
But I appreciate the enthusiasm.
All right, let's give it a try.
Here we go.
Get those feet going.
Come on, get low.
Attaboy.
That's it.
- That was great.
- I just did what you said.
That was perfect, son.
Hit me another one.
You got it.
This time we're gonna try a few new things.
Stay low, just like you did.
That was good.
This time take your left foot, you're gonna point it toward the bag.
Keep your right foot firmly planted in the ground.
You're gonna aim for the lower part of the first baseman's glove while calibrating the number of steps before the runner gets there.
Got it?
I think so.
All right, here we go.
Get low.
Big win today.
Big win.
Big win for the team.
Isn't that right, buzz?
Well played, all of you.
Let us not forget that our valiant opponents also played a heck of a ballgame.
Respect, haircut hut.
Cheers!
I don't know why you're giving that victory speech.
- You almost cost us the game today.
- What?
I had five hits.
You also overthrew first base five times.
All right, look.
I know you're all thinking it, so here it goes.
I am suffering from a mental block.
It goes all the way back to my youth.
It's common amongst highly skilled athletes and international men of leisure.
- They call it the "yips".
- They should call it the "sucks".
Wait, wasn't there that guy What's his name?
Yes.
Former Yankee second baseman Chuck Knoblauch.
All of a sudden he committed an unprecedented number of throwing errors, one of which sailed into the stands and hit Keith Olbermann's mother in the face.
- That's awful.
- Don't worry, Jules, I'm getting help.
I just recently started seeing a sports psychologist, and I'm happy to report that I'm already seeing marked improvement.
- Five errors is an improvement?
- Could have been ten.
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.
Where's my food?
Excuse me, I still haven't gotten my pizza chili cheese fries Also known as the Shawn Spencer.
Not that you'd recognize them as such, seeing as how this establishment refuses to call them that, even though I order them six times a week.
I brought you the fries, sir.
If you'd brought them to me, I think I'd know 'cause I'd be experiencing both euphoria and a burning sensation in the neighborhood of my colon.
- Do you want to speak to my manager?
- I don't want to, I demand to, Jenny.
We will discuss both the name of the dish and the method in which it is expedited.
This guy behind Excuse me, I'm afraid we have Can I help you with anything?
Hold that thought.
Sorry.
Lassie, we may have a real sort of serious problem.
Guys, you shouldn't have.
Come on.
You didn't think we'd forget.
Upgrade that to an emergency.
That guy by the door has a gun.
We need to make a plan.
There's a Louisville slugger on the wall.
I'm gonna crack the glass, use it.
Some of us aren't packing.
Move.
Police!
Freeze, douche bag!
What have we got?
What we've got is a white male, medium build, about 5'10".
Attempted armed robbery.
A few shots exchanged between the perp and myself before he escaped out these doors here.
Looks like more than a few.
I was rounding.
O'Hara, expand the perimeter search.
I want this bastard found.
Thank you, chief.
I'll take it from here.
All right, people, we all went through a terrible ordeal today.
Not only were we almost killed, chief, - I never got my pizza.
- But setting that aside for a second Mr. Spencer, unless you have something that will help this investigation, I suggest you shut the hell up.
I think I do have something, chief.
I'm getting some serious voodoo that the hooded man didn't come to rob the restaurant.
Then what was he doing?
He wanted to kill someone.
Wanted to kill someone?
Who?
One of us.
Psych 405 "Shawn Has the Yips" Timing: Psych Team I don't have time for this.
Fact: the hooded guy came into the restaurant to kill someone at our table.
Fact: he failed, which means he'll probably try again.
Fact: if I can figure out who he was targeting, it'll probably give us insight as to the hooded man's identity.
Those aren't facts.
At best they're a stab in the dark.
A stab in the dark?
Fact: that's a pretty good name for a horror flick.
Remind me to include it in this letter to Wes Craven.
I don't know why.
He never reciprocates.
Maybe against his will.
That doesn't make any sense, Shawn.
- The statements from everyone.
- Great.
I'll look at them.
Your hypothesis is crap.
Who walks into a known cop bar to kill a cop?
- It makes no sense.
- Fact.
You say that word again, I'll punch you in the face.
Truth: there was only $42 in the cash register.
He's right.
The manager verifies it in his statement.
Who walks in and tries to knock off a known cop bar for $42?
That doesn't make any sense.
He's a lowlife whacked out on junk.
I've seen it many, many times.
- Dad.
- Thank god you're okay.
I'm fine.
What's up?
I saw the shooting on TV.
I've been trying to call you.
It's been going to voice mail.
I've been worried to death.
I forgot to turn on my phone.
Let me ask you something.
What did you do right after the shooting?
I called my folks to tell them I was okay.
- And what was the first thing he did?
- He ate a banana.
- You ate a banana?
- I sure did.
You know why?
Because it makes me think of you, 'cause you're my big ol' papa monkey.
I need to see everyone who was present at the shooting.
That's us.
Gotta go.
Thanks for coming by, dad.
- Gus, am I overreacting?
- No.
We're not done here, Shawn.
Since you were involved in an armed robbery attempt and subsequent shooting, per department policy, Dr. Erlich is here to offer counseling to anyone who wants it.
If no one needs to speak with Dr. Erlich Okay, let's get back to work.
Excuse me.
I didn't want to show weakness in front of the rest of the group, but I could use a little counseling.
There's no shame in asking for help.
- You can use the conference room.
- Right.
Do I have to use the department's psychologist?
- Not technically.
- 'Cause I'd like to call in my own guy.
- This is a sports psychologist.
- Yes, I know.
Dr. Manny is fantastic, and he's helping me with the yips.
I'm not using public funds to help you overcome your mental block of overthrowing first base.
Would it help if I told you I'm also pee-shy?
Chief?
CSI found these in the alley behind the sports bar.
Room 16.
The downtowner motel.
This matches the shooter's sweatshirt.
Which he probably ripped while escaping, and the key fell out.
There's a damn good chance that he's at this location.
- I know this place.
Let's go.
- I'll drive.
No need.
I finally got my car back from the shop.
It's perfect time.
I am gonna ask you to sit on a towel, though.
No offense.
Why would I be offended by that?
I don't know what we're gonna find here.
The shooter's back at the motel.
Gus, don't be the ribs that flip over Fred Flintstone's car.
I know you're not completely sold on my hit man theory, but I need you to suspend your disbelief and hop on board the streetcar named Shawnsire.
You know how that metaphor makes me uncomfortable.
- I knew it.
- What?
I knew there was something about that guy that didn't scream "junky thief".
He was wearing a $5,000 watch.
And I know his socks were 80 bucks 'cause I just ordered some with your Nordstrom's card.
I told you to stay out of my wallet.
Like you're not gonna be happy when you get those points.
- I got it.
- You know who the hit man was after?
No, I know what happened to my pizza chili cheese fries.
That dumpy catcher from the haircut hut got them.
Now there's a purple-haired lesbian running around with dyspepsia that should be mine.
I'll be in the car.
- Gus, freeze!
- What?
Excuse me.
Where would I find the monitor that goes with that surveillance camera?
Under the hostess stand.
But the cops already took the tape from the day.
I'm not interested in the tape.
Can I move now?
Exactly two steps to your right.
That guy's a lot smarter than Lassie gave him credit for.
Check it out.
What?
He knew exactly where to stand so that surveillance camera wouldn't pick him up.
Why would someone so intelligent carelessly drop their motel room key?
They wouldn't Unless It was a dummy lead.
Juliet confirmed it.
The shooter wasn't at the motel.
Lassiter still thinks this guy's a junky thief, so he's combing the area in case the perp saw them and took off.
Yeah, I figured I'd need more to convince Lassie.
That's why I've completely restaged the crime scene with stand-ins where each of us were sitting.
This way I can figure out who the shooter was targeting.
Let me guess.
I'm the pepper, you're the salt.
Juliet's the sugar, Lassiter's the lemon, McNab's the cherry - Mashed potatoes?
Really?
- This is actually kind of fun.
- Did you scoop out the last lesbian?
- Just tell me what you got.
All right, we know that the shooter held his position at the door - for exactly 26 seconds.
- And we know this how?
Because that's how long it takes to sing happy birthday.
I got the singing, Shawn.
Upgrade that to an emergency.
I know who he was after.
- Seriously, how's Lassie?
- Not good.
- Oh, man.
- Yeah, I've never seen him this bad.
This son of a bitch destroyed my car.
Calm down, Carlton.
At least you're okay.
- You should count your blessings.
- Shawn's call kept you from being hit.
Jules, it's not important that it was me that saved Lassie's life, or that I was right, or that he should have listened to me from the start because I was right.
The important thing is that you're unharmed, and that it was because of me and I was right.
Do you know how much the city gonna pay to fix this?
Are you asking Shawn the psychic, or Shawn the guy who worked for a couple afternoons at a Meineke?
Do you have any idea who'd want to shoot you?
A lot of people want to kill me.
I take great pride in that.
Spencer, are you getting any vibrations on who that might be?
Chief, the psychic universe is echoing Lassie's sentiments.
He has so many enemies, it literally could have been anyone.
- His landlord.
His mailman.
- His ex-wife.
Bigfoot.
Okay, we'll start with someone that Lassiter busted.
Okay, but that only eliminates Bigfoot.
By the way, little-known fact: bigfoot He only wore a size ten.
I need ballistics on the shooter's gun and details on its vantage point when he fired on Lassiter.
All right, since I'm point on this, you pull all my old case files, start going over them.
I'm hitting the streets.
You're staying put.
No, I can't have my lead detective on the street with a target on him.
Okay, so I'll organize things from here.
I also can't have any appearance of bias or a conflict of interest in this investigation.
O'Hara, you're taking over as point.
I'll assign someone the field work, you go over the old cases.
Spencer, I need you to get any readings you can from the evidence.
And I want you kept in this room under 24-hour guard.
What?
Sorry about this, partner.
The frozen yogurt guy's out front.
Did you want to go get one?
Wait, you can't.
These cases offer the most promise.
In each of them the perp threatened physical harm against Lassiter.
- All right, let's dig in.
- Are you looking at Palermo?
- Don't forget about Palermo.
- We won't.
- How'bout Fletcher?
- Him too.
Hold that up a little higher so I can see it.
This isn't gonna work.
What?
Much better.
Absolutely.
We're just missing one thing.
Yeah, pizza.
I was going to say an immersion therapy tank and hallucinogens, - but I could go for a slice.
- Yeah, I'm hungry.
I'll call Luigi's.
They deliver.
They deliver hallucinogens?
That doesn't seem legal, does it?
Where's the cordless phone?
- Why me?
- You always lose it.
No, I don't lose it.
I place it somewhere that later eludes me.
That's the same thing.
Maybe to those of us without the nuance chromosome.
What?
Maybe instead of arguing about it, we should actually look for it.
Whose elliptical is this?
Why don't you take a look at our bodies and judge for yourself.
Gus, when did you get it?
Why don't you take a look at 'em in a month, when I'm ripped to the bone, have an eight-pack.
Possibly nine.
Tall boys.
You can play my abs like a harp.
He never uses it.
I just joined a gym, and I got into this incredible fitness regimen.
It's all about self-motivation.
If you want me to teach you some of the tricks my trainer taught me No thanks.
I'm not really into the whole motivational Tony Robbins thing I prefer his brother Baskin.
Hello, Mrs. Garcia.
Is your husband available?
I see.
Would you please give him a message for me?
This is detective Carlton Lassiter.
Let that fat bastard know that I know that he's the one trying to kill me, and if he wants to tangle, baby, my dance card is wide open!
I see.
I am very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
I actually had an uncle with coronary disease, so I understand I can't find that phone anywhere.
I guess we're having doritos for dinner.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Vibrations piercing through from the other side.
Person of interest, possible shooter, just released from prison.
Ivan Petrovich.
I was just reading that guy's file.
He's some sort of drug lord or something.
Where is it?
Here it is.
- That's weird.
- What?
Our names are listed on the case, but we didn't work on it.
And yet we got paid for it.
- I was never paid for it.
- Maybe we didn't.
- Did you or did you not get paid?
- I don't know, Jules.
I'd have to check some files, crunch some numbers, place some calls.
- You took money, but you did nothing?
- I answered the phone, and it was the chief, which technically makes me a consultant.
Was it a misdial?
Maybe.
Why are we splitting hairs?
Ivan Petrovich isn't just a drug lord.
He's the worst kind.
He targets high school kids.
Remember that quarterback that od'd?
- It was in the newspaper.
- I only read the London financial times and dog fancy.
Oh, boy.
I officially feel guilty.
I'll return the $500, plus interest.
I'll apologize to the family and I'll do the thing in the box with the guy in the thing.
Confession?
I need to get back to the station and tell Vick about Petrovich.
Enjoy your doritos.
That's a bummer.
Should we start trying to track this guy down?
The sooner we do, the sooner Lassie isn't sequestered at the station.
It could wait till tomorrow.
I remember Petrovich.
He's the worst kind of scum that there is.
All right, I'm putting an APB out on him.
Why is my speakerphone on?
Chief, I demand to be the one to bring in Petrovich.
He was listening in on our conversation?
Chief, my partner has the right to know who tried to kill him.
All right, this one is personal.
Petrovich is a monster.
That one family whose lives he destroyed when their son od'd on his poison During his trial, he turned around and winked at them.
- I remember as well as you do.
- And all I was able to get him on is a weapons charge.
Now, that has eaten me up for three years.
That's not your fault.
You got him on what you could, and we've all been there.
Look, I have to think about your safety.
This man is hell-bent on revenge, and he's targeting the one officer who put him away.
I didn't work that case alone.
McNab was there when I busted petrovich.
- Where's McNab?
- He's off duty.
I'll run the search on Petrovich.
O'Hara, give McNab a call, just to make sure that he's okay.
Better yet, go by his place.
I'm sorry.
Officers, please.
This is ridiculous.
Damn it!
Come on, McNab.
Go around back.
Thank God.
I was just in the shower.
What's up?
Ivan Petrovich tried to kill Lassiter, you were in on his arrest, he's threatened you too.
That guy's the devil.
For your safety, Beckett is gonna stay with you.
I'm gonna check back in a little while, okay?
- Nice robe.
- Thanks.
I'm just gonna grab my mail.
Go on in.
I'll make us some eggs.
- How bad is he?
- He's stable.
Looks like he's gonna be fine.
Luckily, it was a crude device.
It was rigged to go off the second the mailbox key was turned.
The blast blew him into the pool and probably saved his life.
Hell.
- This is Burton Guster.
- Gus, thank God you're all right!
Juliet?
Looks like Petrovich may be targeting everyone who was on the case, which includes you.
But we didn't actually work on the case.
Somehow Petrovich may have seen the file.
Have you talked to Shawn?
What are you doing?
"If your heart rate drops below 150, you die"?
The bomb squad is on its way.
How did you figure this was booby-trapped?
I saw that Petrovich went after McNab on the local news.
I put it all together.
I can't believe we're being targeted for a case that we never worked on.
- At least we got paid for it.
- Really?
I'm starring in the elliptical version of Speed, and you're guilting me?
It's more like Lethal Weapon 2.
Where Danny Glover found the bomb attached to his toilet.
God, I would kill to be on a toilet right now.
- I'm not gonna die on this thing?
- Don't think like that, Shawn.
Whatever happens, I'll be right here.
Where the heck are they?
- I'm really tired.
- Wait, wait.
No, no.
Just hang in there, Shawn.
They'll be here any second now.
Look, I just I just gotta say that I know.
I got $800 for the Petrovich case.
Not $500.
I forgive you.
Shawn, are you all right?
Where's the bomb?
- Down there.
- Why are you exercising?
If his heart rate drops below 150, he's toast.
My God, I wrote this note.
- What?
- I left it for Shawn as a motivator.
I do the same thing.
It's a trick my trainer taught me.
What kind of sick trainer have you been working with?
Wait a second, so what is the beeping, blinking thing?
We're idiots.
Will you Please make it stop.
Thank God.
Go.
- Go back.
- All right.
Watch my back.
Enough!
If Petrovich knew you were listed, he would've already made a move.
Now, man up and let's go.
- We're cool.
- We're men.
Get down!
Everybody's good?
Everybody's good.
It's McNab.
I didn't know he was out yet.
Buzz, buddy!
Hey, guys.
That bomb did a number on your eyebrow.
- Blew it clean off.
- Amazing.
Just the brow.
It's okay.
I've still got one good one.
How are you feeling?
The doctors say I have a concussion, but I fine feel.
- Plus I've lost parts of three toes.
- That's terrible, man.
What's going on with you?
You have a tickle in your throat?
- No, I'm just a little dehydrated.
- Jeez.
Here I am, going on and on about losing toes and getting blown 20 feet, and you're dying of thirst.
- Let's get you some water.
- Buzz, I can get it.
It's okay, I You stay here.
You know, do whatever you want.
I had a killer workout this morning.
All right, everyone, listen up.
As most of you know, Ivan Petrovich is back on the streets, and he's targeting our own.
And this morning he went after officer McNab with a bomb.
Bringing in Petrovich is our number one priority.
And the person who I've put in charge, despite my concern for his safety, is the man who knows Petrovich more than all of us combined.
Detective Carlton Lassiter.
Big dinger!
Lassie!
Thank you, everyone.
It's good to be back on the case.
I've made up a list of all the places I think Petrovich might be hiding.
They're being passed out.
I want each location surveilled or checked out immediately.
You've all been assigned an individual team, which you'll find in the lower right hand corner.
- Excuse me.
- What?
What is it?
Shawn Spencer here.
I'm having a psychic vision.
It's of a place that's not on your list.
Martin's Foogoo Chair.
Sonny and Cher Lair.
Martin's Lair of the White Worm.
Martin's Shoe Repair?
That's a phony business Petrovich used for his drug trade.
He wouldn't be hiding there.
It's the size of a phone booth.
There's an extra room.
There's more to that place.
This is a very strong hit.
I think it's worth checking out.
Why don't you stop by?
Fine.
You ride with O'Hara and I. The rest of you, let's get on it.
We've got work to do.
- There's nobody in here.
- That's a shame.
I was hoping Daniel Day Lewis'd be here to fix the rip in my tretorns.
The man cobbles.
I knew this was a waste of time.
Let's go, O'Hara.
Daddy's getting something.
Oh, yeah, he's definitely getting something.
I'm sensing there's an extra room attached to this place.
A secret room.
We just have to find the secret It's not this.
But what do we have here?
Shawn, you might want to let this go.
What is this thing?
Look, there's gotta be like a secret lever or Let's go.
Did you guys hear that?
It sounds like Petrovich has a dead spot.
Move that table.
It's weighting like a entire tree.
I'm going down there.
I know you're down here, Petrovich.
Why didn't we stay up?
I told you I get freaked out by tassels.
I got him.
Look at that.
- Lassie's getting some press.
- Good for him.
He deserves it.
wo can get on camera the most.
You're on.
How does it feel to have taken out one of SB's most notorious drug lords, a man who was personally targeting you?
I'm happy that particular piece of scum is off the street.
Let's just leave it at that.
Describe the moment for us.
Were you scared?
I don't get scared, Linda.
He reached for his gun, and I reacted.
You should ask Petrovich that question.
I can't.
He's dead.
Right.
- So what's next, detective?
- Well, there's still Knock it off!
There's still work to be done, but I am gonna take the time to visit some of the members of our community who were most affected by Petrovich.
It's gonna feel pretty good to give them this news.
There it is.
And here it comes.
And wait for it.
- Wait for it - I don't get scared, Linda.
- 4 and half seconds.
I win.
- There's no way.
Sorry, Gus.
The watch does not lie.
Doritos, i'll never get sick of you.
You have to admit, Lassiter stepped up big today.
Yeah, I guess.
- Do you not agree?
- I don't know.
Don't you think there was something weird?
Lots of things were weird.
Like your irrational fear of tassels.
- Irrational?
- Yes.
What purpose do tassels serve on shoes?
- I don't know.
- I do.
Evil.
I'm sorry.
There's still something bugging me.
You want me to do a little armchair psychology on you?
- No, I do not.
- I think you're jealous of Lassie.
I'm happy to admit that Lassie succeeded.
Really?
Then why did you just put "succeeded" in air quotes?
Okay, fine.
Lassie did great today.
- There, you happy?
- I would if you really meant it.
Lassie did great today.
- Lassie did great today.
- Oh, God.
- Lassie did great today.
- You know what - Today - Rewind his interview.
I'm retiming.
An exclusive interview with the detective who single-handedly took out notorious drug boss What are you doing?
The shooter had no scar.
- I take it all back.
- What are you talking about?
- Look at Petrovich's left hand.
- What?
Just look at it!
You see that scar?
Yeah.
So?
So Petrovich wasn't the guy in the bar.
Why haven't you been picking up?
We didn't hear the This is charging.
This is not.
What's wrong with you?
I don't know why this give me so much trouble.
I just saw the coroner's report on Petrovich.
He had already been dead for two hours before we got there.
- Lassiter shot a dead guy?
- Sounds about right.
So whoever's targeting Lassiter and McNab is still out there.
- How did he die, by the way?
- Drug overdose.
A major one.
They found giant amounts of PCP, heroin, and methamphetamine in his system.
Damn.
The guy's in prison for three years.
He gets out and then ods?
Did the coroner's report say anything about him being restrained, or abrasions on his body?
He had rope burns on his wrists.
Petrovich didn't kill himself.
Someone tied him up and forced the drugs on him.
Was Lassiter serious when he wanted to reach out to members of the community whose lives were affected?
He's been doing it all day.
Why?
I think he's in serious trouble.
Mr. Salamatchia.
Thanks for meeting me here.
Of course.
- Would you mind?
- Of course not, sir.
I have some great news, if you haven't heard already.
What would that be?
Okay, thanks.
Let me know.
There's still no word from Lassiter.
And they checked Salamatchia's home but there's nobody.
He was special ops, twice decorated.
- Any other addresses listed for him?
- He owns a restaurant across town.
What's the address?
Today is the anniversary of his son's death.
I know where they are.
So it was you this entire time.
I'm sorry, sir, I just don't get it.
Petrovich pumps drugs into our schools, and my son ends up dead, and you lock him away on a guns charge?
That's my definition of not getting it.
Put 'em down.
Look The gun charge was all I could get him on at the time.
I wanted him off the streets.
What am I supposed to do?
Poison him.
Blow him up.
Make him dead.
That's murder.
That's justice.
I'm a soldier.
I've killed people whose muddy boots Petrovich wasn't good enough to lick.
His death, and yours, is just my way of bringing things back into balance.
You see my point.
What I see is a decent man whose grief has driven him to the breaking point.
Don't pretend that you feel something for me, please.
I've given the better part of my career chasing the Petroviches of the world because of people like you.
I understand the pain that he's put you through.
I've lost my only child, gone through a divorce.
Just what the hell do you know?
Mr. Salamatchia Sorry, detective.
Freeze!
Drop it!
You drop it or I'll kill him right now.
Now!
Please tell me one of you is carrying a weapon.
Weapon?
No.
Wait.
It's just It's just this.
You are unbelievable.
It's okay.
It's totally out of range.
- I recognize you.
- Yes, sir.
- We're listed on the Petrovich case.
- No, we are not.
- I'm not gonna lie.
- Since when?
No, I saw you in the bar.
I know everything there is to know about that case.
You weren't on it.
- One time.
- What?
Get those feet going.
Get low.
Get low.
Attaboy.
One time.
Damn it.
Good work.
Great work, Lassie.
Did you just throw our cordless phone into a tree?
A man's life was hanging in the balance.
It was clearly our only move.
You're buying us a new phone, Shawn.
Your mind is not an opponent, Shawn.
It's a teammate.
A teammate that's there for you in good times and bad.
You may not always get along It may be moody Wear your shower sandals without permission.
But never doubt its loyalty.
So when I roll this ball to you, I want you to scoop it up and deliver a perfect strike, knowing all the while that your teammate is pulling for you.
I did it.
I'm over the yips.
What?
I knew you could do it, Shawn!
I'm so proud of you!
Little long on the hug.
Thank you, though, doc.
My pleasure.
You still want me to bill chief vick?
Yeah, but we're calling this "trauma therapy".
Will do.
See ya, Gus.
That's it, buddy.
I'm back to being a five-tool player.
Call me Tori Hunter, but do it in the jamaican accent.
Me said 'em call me tori hunter.
Can we now go to Kingston's and get some jerk chicken?
- I'm starving.
- Let me get the stuff.
Your treat too.
You still owe me for those socks.
You still owe me for your whole life.
You know what they say about athletes and mental blocks?
Don't even try it.
I'm not trying anything.
I'm just stating the fact that most athletes find that when they get over one mental block, it shows itself in another part of their game.
For example, hitting.
You trying to go Hannibal Lecter on me?
Are you out of your mind?
This is one unflappable element of my game.
- You want me to throw it at you?
- Serve one up.
You bring that little tater over here.
You bring that little tater tot.
Gimme another one.
Put it in here.
Die!
Dr. Manny!
Could you come back, please?
All right, come on.
Bring that meat.
Damn it!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Special girl, huh?
Yeah, kind of.
It's nice to see you applying yourself.
It looks like you put a lot of work into that.
Thanks, dad, but I don't know if I'm gonna send it.
Why?
Why, Shawn?
- There are obstacles.
- Obstacles?
All couples have obstacles.
The key to it is, you're never gonna know unless you put yourself out there.
- Gus says it'll never work.
- What does Gus know?
Gus is 12.
You remember at that skate party how he cried when that girl touched his arm?
Come on.
- What do you think?
- Let's see.
The heart is good.
You tell her that she's pretty, but not in an creepy, aggressive kind of way.
I like that.
Down here, I think what you wanna do is, I think you wanna tell her that you'd like to call her sometime.
Do that.
It looks like you forgot to address it there.
You want to write her name big and pretty, make her think she's important.
You know how sometimes I write and I do the calligraphy with big loops and swooping letters?
Do that, do that up there.
Dad, could you do it?
Yeah, sure, I guess.
All right, what's her name?
Mrs. Phillips.
What's wrong?
I hate having to hide what we have.
You know, we can't really be together until you tell her.
I will.
Soon.
Mina?
You're back on in two minutes.
- I'll go.
- No.
I don't want to disturb your ritual.
It's bad luck.
This is my "I told you so" room, where I like to gloat after a completely wild accusation turns out to be spot on.
That's my "oops" corner, where I apologize to people for being arrested after a completely wild accusation turns out to be just that.
Over there is where you get gum.
- Free, by the way.
- What?
- This is - I know you.
I met you at our high-school reunion.
Yes, you did.
- Shawn tells me you're a teacher.
- Yeah, kindergarten.
That's great.
I think that's great.
I mean, kids they're so great.
That must be really fun.
You know, I loved my kindergarten teacher.
Before I went into law enforcement, I actually considered teach This is detective Carlton Lassiter.
I do his job and sometimes his hair, though clearly not today.
I'm really sorry.
I can't play with you today.
I'm about to go solve another case and do it in record time.
It is at this point that I must decide which part of that very bold statement to riff off of.
Now, I can hone in on "another", which implies - that he's solved more than one.
- That's pretty easy, though.
Or I crack down on "record time" and the positive, for him, record time is, like, 2 and half years.
- Good, not great.
- You drive a hard bargain.
- You love it.
- I know.
Why don't you go home and wait for me not to call you?
He's just saying that so that it'll be more dramatic later on - when he has to ask for my help.
- More dramatic for who?
I don't know.
That guy, I guess.
All right, so what exactly is this information about the accident behind the theater earlier?
This was no accident.
Really?
Well, that's helpful.
And you You know the victim?
Victims, plural.
Mina wasn't the only one.
Fortunately, she is the only one who didn't get hurt.
Sir, you are exactly what I needed today.
We're gonna have to do this quick while his girlfriend is still waiting.
Whose girlfriend?
Never you mind.
I'm thinking out loud.
Don't want to interrupt your flow.
I like what you're saying, so let's just go straight to the million-dollar question: who exactly is responsible?
I am.
I hurt them all.
I'm a danger to everyone around me.
All right, Mr. Singh, this is how it's gonna work.
See, sometimes there are these bleeding-heart activist judges who won't take a detective's iron-clad word for it when he gets a perfectly uncoerced confession.
So just so we're clear, I'd like you to write everything down.
When you did it, where you did it, why you did it.
Now, the why is very important.
- You're done?
- Yes.
You just wrote, like, three words.
Would you excuse me?
I'll just be a minute.
This place was actually built by the Amish, which explains the complete and utter lack of zippers.
I was too harsh.
- When?
- Just now.
Perhaps always.
The truth is, the guy in the interrogation room "A" is a solid lead, and I just don't have the - You know, to follow through.
- What exactly are you trying to say?
I'm saying I need your help.
All right, but only if Abigail can watch.
I'll put a chair in the viewing room.
Perfect.
Thanks, buddy.
This should be interesting.
First, I want to tell you that I love you.
Secondly What can I do for you?
Raj.
- Can I call you Roger?
- First name's Rajesh.
I'll stick with Roger.
I'm going to tell you what I do.
I don't want you to freak out because it's so cool.
I'm a psychic, a great and powerful psychic whose powers inspire fear and awe in those who first experience them.
I am a crime-solving machine, and I have closed over 50 cases, many without pants.
Finally, someone who will understand me.
You can talk to me.
I am your friend.
I hurt people, lots of people, lots of innocent people.
It's funny, 'cause you don't really strike me as a violent guy.
How could you commit these crimes?
I can't help it.
The attacks, they just happen.
I see.
And what, you use some sort of weapon?
I am the weapon.
Really?
And it's immediate.
Even I can't predict it.
I can just be alone in a room with somebody.
Got it.
In that case, Raj, I think all that's left here, question-wise, is "why"?
I mean, why, why, why do you hurt these people?
Why have I hurt these people?
You got to see this.
Wait for it.
Here it comes.
It's because I It's because I'm It's because I'm cursed.
Yes, I win.
Finally!
Finally I put one over on him.
This is This is completely satisfying.
You're a psychic.
You must believe me.
You must be able to help me.
Can you?
Yes, I can, Roger.
I will break your curse, and I will solve this case, mostly Because the detective who was in here earlier cannot.
This is so good.
Psych 406 "Bollywood Homicide" Timing: Psych Team - Where are the bunnies?
- What?
You said someone left a dozen bunnies, and you didn't know how to feed them.
I made that up.
I just needed you here, man.
- This is about a case, isn't it?
- What do you think?
I should have known, when you said they were falling asleep in your hand.
Look, I was humiliated by Lassiter, Carlton Lassiter.
A challenge has been issued, I need every tool we've got.
- Are you calling me a tool?
- I'm calling you my partner.
My logic brain, my magic wish machine.
What have we got?
My name is Raj.
I have a curse.
I don't do curses.
You know that.
- Gus, come on.
- That mummy almost sucked my eyes out.
- It wasn't a mummy.
- Yes, it was.
It was a snobby guy and an effeminate dude in a wheelchair.
Apples and oranges.
This is a love curse.
This poor guy thinks there's some kind of hex on all the girls he tries to hook up with.
We investigate, find some evidence, convince him he's not cursed so that he can live a full and happy life with his lady love.
Man, this is a matter of the heart.
- He's paying us, right?
- Yeah, cash.
The last four women that I've dated have all had terrible accidents.
And with each girl, it gets worse and worse.
The first one had a car accident.
Another's apartment burned down.
What do you do after these things happen?
I break up with them.
I have tried to be alone, believe me, I have, but then I met Mina, and my heart couldn't help itself.
I keep thinking that the next time will be different, but every woman that I fall in love with is targeted by forces I can't fight.
Do you have any enemies in this world?
I'm a nice guy.
I don't know why anybody would want to curse me.
You are a nice guy, Roger.
And I presume you could teach us both a thing or two about cricket.
But let's not jump to conclusions.
Show me where this accident occurred.
It was just inappropriate, Carlton, with his girlfriend standing there.
When has anything he's ever done to me been appropriate?
Having his girlfriend there was just a gift from god for all my good deeds.
Speak of the devil.
I want you to know that I am not gonna gloat about what happened yesterday.
Yesterday, why?
What happened?
What day is this?
The truck ended up striking the dumpster, fortunately, which pinned the girl between the grill and the wall, but left her enough room to escape without serious injury.
We talked to the driver, who swears that he put blocks under the tires to prevent the truck from rolling down the alley, which is on an incline.
- So it is a case?
- I checked out the driver.
He's been written up twice for failing to take basic safety precautions.
- So it's not a case?
- We don't know yet.
The brakes haven't been checked in 15 years.
It looks like an accident.
- Like your hair.
- Really?
Down to hair jokes now?
That is so sweet.
Look how much he cares for her.
He's really taking this accident pretty hard.
My brother Jay is a choreographer, he's been trying to get this playhouse to put on a bollywood-style show for years.
There he is.
Come on, now.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Mina said she was coming in to rehearsals today.
I'm just gonna go check on her, make sure she's okay after the accident.
- You don't think Lassiter may be right?
- Gus, please.
Don't be Harry Potter and the prisoner of marzipan.
- Azkaban.
- I've read it both ways.
- No, you haven't.
- Of course I don't think he's right, but it's not looking too good for Raj's whole curse idea either.
How many of you have seen All That Jazz?
No?
White nights?
Gregory Hines, Baryshnikov?
That explains everything.
We're gonna redo the whole routine.
Go wait in my dressing room.
Go, go, go.
Lakshmi, she's Mina's understudy.
Excellent.
Yes, she is.
So it's safe to assume that you don't believe in this curse?
Everything that goes wrong in his life, he blames on the curse.
I mean, it's a crutch.
Don't get me wrong, I love him like a brother.
He is your brother.
Yeah, by blood, but he doesn't live in the same world as the rest of us.
He lives in a world of magic and goblins, and what he needs to do is step into reality, okay?
Up!
Talk some sense into him.
I'm getting married in a month, I would love to have a reasonable person as my best man.
He believes in you, psychic, for better or for worse.
That butterfly was right.
Raj is a guy that just needs to get out of his own head.
Everything bad that happens to him, he interprets as some sort of divine intervention.
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
How do we break him out of the pattern?
Apparently he believes in me, so I will lift his curse, and you will be my special helper.
Cursed girlfriend-ruiner, be gone.
This seems dangerous.
You're not letting the curse leave your body.
- He's right.
You could electrocute him.
- Really?
- His hand is in water.
- You tell me that now.
You saw what I was doing us at that bowl.
Repeat after me.
"I am not cursed.
- "It's all in my head".
- But it's not all in my head.
You have to say it in order to believe it.
Let me do the rest.
- Who is the professional here?
- You?
Close your eyes.
I am not cursed.
It's all in my head.
- I'm feeling it.
- Really?
Get me the hedge clippers.
I guess I am feeling something.
It's tingling.
That's the electrical breaker shorting out.
- What?
- It's shorting out.
His hand's in water.
Are you here?
Give me a hand, I got some groceries here.
- Hallelujah, the curse is broken.
- What?
All gone.
Get your coat.
- Broken?
- All broken.
Let's get out efore it finds you again.
All gone.
You're curse-free.
What the hell?
Smoke in my living room?
Dad, it's not smoke.
It's just a little dry ice, okay?
We're helping a client by freeing him of the feelings that he might be cursed.
The guy that's got the girlfriends that keep dropping like flies?
One girl that we know of for sure.
She almost got crushed by a runaway truck, but she's fine, relatively.
- Did you talk to her?
- I didn't need to.
She's not gonna crush herself.
Smart-ass.
All right, just clean up this crap.
Ten-four.
That's me, cleaning machine.
You seem different.
What?
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your whoever they are?
That's Shawn and Greg.
And they helped me out with a problem earlier, and I owe them.
Can you hook my friends up with two tickets for tonight's performance?
Standing room, back of the theater - Some reward.
- Come on, Greg.
Let's just congratulate each other on a job well done and enjoy this explosion of culture.
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
Just celebrating another successful conclusion to a case.
- In record time.
- What?
Really?
Then you know that the brake lines on the truck were severed?
Look, Lassie, that truck was very old.
Parts can snap at any time.
You also know, the safety blocks that should have been under the tires were found in the dumpster.
Maybe we should have done some actual investigating.
- You think?
- What are you two talking about?
Nothing.
I just might need to go up there.
No, Shawn, you do not go up under any circumstances.
- I think we made a huge mistake.
- I don't care.
- Shawn, stop it!
- Let go!
Don't go boneless on me My back!
I got you.
I told you it was a curse.
Did you notice anything suspicious around the stage today?
And you can't think of anyone that's been threatening you?
No one.
Don't you worry, miss.
I'm gonna find the person who did this.
I'm done.
You can take her.
Raj, will you meet me at the hospital?
No, I can't.
- I have to go.
- Go where?
I need you.
This is all my fault.
I am so sorry For everything.
Raj, come back!
They're taking Mina for x-rays.
Some uniforms stay with her, then take her home.
We should send a unit to secure her residence as well.
This ladder is really built for one.
Jules, lots of things say they're built for one, but can easily fit two people.
Tanning beds, iron lung That's just to name two.
Why are you still here?
II thought you solved this case hours ago.
- Lassiter's really got your goat, huh?
- Yeah, he does, and I want it back.
God knows what he's doing to that poor thing.
You don't really believe in love curses, do you?
Jules, I'm a psychic.
I have to remain open to any number of Why, do you?
Well, I think that everybody who's looking for a soul mate may, at one time, feel that there are outside forces conspiring against them, but Shawn, what are you doing?
It wasn't a curse Not this time.
Plastic.
That wasn't gonna hold Mina for long.
Snapped in two and painted to look like metal.
This means we're looking for a real flesh and blood human being or a genetically enhanced monkey.
Either way, someone wanted to hurt this girl.
I'll have forensics see what they can get off of these.
- This doesn't make sense.
- Why?
Because there were, like, I mean, how would the perpetrator know that this trapdoor would give way at the precise moment that Mina danced across it?
What are we doing here?
I thought we were going to a movie.
Yes, movie, later.
But first, Gus and I need to knock off some quick case business.
You!
He must've mistaken us for someone else.
Go away, Shawn!
I wonder how many Shawns he knows.
I should double-check.
You are a fraud!
Dude, if you don't let us in, we're gonna break through your window.
We need to talk to you.
We got to figure out who could've wanted to hurt Mina.
Fine.
It's okay.
Fine.
Curse breaker?
You ridicule me?
My hand in a bowl of water?
You could've gotten Mina killed.
The reason the ceremony didn't work, Raj, is because you are not cursed.
- It was sabotage, and I know this.
- And how can you be so sure?
Because I happen to travel in these sort of metaphysical arenas, dude.
As sure as I am that Gus will accidentally cause his own death I know that you are not cursed.
Now, we need to talk to you and Mina.
Is she here or what?
Who's out there?
Come on.
Wonderful.
More mouths to feed.
Thank you for the advance notice.
No, we didn't come to eat.
You know, guys, my grandmother tends to make her food a little spicy.
- You might want to take it easy.
- Please.
I'm one-quarter Jamaican.
- I'm also one-quarter Jamaican.
- You are not!
Stop telling people that!
So how do you know my grandson Jay?
We're actually friends of Raj.
You're not here for Jay and Sita's engagement dinner?
We're helping Raj with a problem.
I'm sorry, was this chicken seasoned with molten lava?
Sorry about that Wedding stuff.
Hi, I'm Sita.
Hi.
Did you get the mango leaves?
They're not in season.
How can we have a wedding without mango leaves?
Very inauspicious.
We could push the wedding date, if it means that much to you.
Again?
How many times are we gonna do this?
Until it's right.
But I already booked Kajagoogoo for the party.
What do you mean, like a cover band?
Come on, kid.
Don't worry.
It's gonna be great.
It'll be beautiful.
This wedding business is more trouble than it's worth.
Better than being alone forever.
Really?
You're just fine?
I taught English to children in Mumbai for a month.
This is very authentic.
What's the matter, Shawn, you don't like it?
- I think I like it too much.
- It's so authentic.
I can't see anything out of my left eye.
I see dead people.
- My god, even the water's spicy.
- Who does that?
What are you watching?
Footage from the night that Mina was almost killed.
On the right screen is a performance from a week ago.
Why you watching this?
We were there.
Went over the stage with a comb.
Just something that Shawn said at the crime scene.
Wait.
Do you see what I see?
Looks like I better get a warrant.
All right.
I'm sorry, no offense, but it's stupid that you people eat food this hot.
I said "no offense," right?
You should marry her.
Dadi.
She's not on tonight's menu, sorry.
She's so much better than your other lady friends.
There were some real gems amongst those.
Dadi, those were all very nice people.
And you found all of the things that you said were stolen.
More uninvited guests.
Thank you all very much.
I'll just go to my garden and harvest some food.
Okay, I will get that.
Spencer, excellent.
I'm so glad that you're here to see me close your case.
Would you like a little insight into our process?
You see, first we start by asking a few simple questions.
Jay, would you mind telling me who has changed the choreography so that only Mina danced over the trapdoor?
Of course, I changed the choreography, but I had no idea And who originally wanted Mina's understudy for the role?
Well, I originally recommended Lakshmi, but then I grew to appreciate Mina, especially after she and Raj started You have to stop him.
Sorry, I don't think it'll be possible.
You see, my partner's already searching his apartment as we speak, and guess what she already found?
Turns out Jay's the one that rented and had access to the truck that almost killed Mina.
Jawaharlal Singh, stand up, put your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest for attempted murder.
- Stand up.
- What?
Let's go, tough guy.
Lassie, you can't do this.
You're way, way off base.
What are you talking about?
You're the one who gave us the choreography lead.
Thank you for that, by the way.
Come on, come on!
But we're supposed to get married in a month.
You're destroying my family.
So you came here to help Raj.
But instead you got his brother arrested for attempted murder.
That's correct.
Business as usual?
It's a process.
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
Don't cry.
We'll sort it out.
- Here's the good news.
- You see what you've done?
You ridiculed my curse and my beliefs, and now it's affecting everyone I love.
First it was Mina, then my brother, and now Sita, who's like a sister to me.
Look, Raj, I can fix this.
The case against Jay is pretty strong.
They have motive, means, opportunity.
The only thing they don't have is a video of him committing the crime.
Maybe you can find that for the cops too, Shawn.
Leave us all alone.
You've done enough.
Stop it, Raj.
Just stop.
There is no curse.
Someone is doing this to you.
Really?
Then how do you explain what happened to Gita, Raini, Dipti, and Victoria, huh?
- He's like a puma.
- We need to get out of here.
- How'd he get up so fast?
- I don't know.
- I blinked, and he was right there.
- He's probably right.
We should talk to Gila, Ray Jay, and Dipstick.
You know those names were nowhere near close, right?
It all started with the break-in at my condo.
And then a car accident.
Next thing I knew, my apartment was on fire.
We talked about moving in together, right before it ended.
I met his family on Friday, and by the next weekend, it was over.
He seemed really sad to call it off.
Right when things were best, I thought he was the one.
I had that accident.
Then he said we couldn't be together.
Are you as jealous of this guy as I am?
More Except for the parts where his girlfriends almost die.
They're releasing my brother, no thanks to you.
Actually, all thanks to me.
I'm the one that lined up his alibi with the timeline of the crime.
I'm the one that found two witnesses that put him someplace else when the sabotage occurred.
And I am the one that got him arrested in the first place.
That last one didn't play.
Just scratch the last one, okay?
We spoke to your other girlfriends.
And we have concluded that they were all kind of hot.
That's true.
But more importantly, there's a pattern here.
This person, whoever's out to get you, only strikes when you get serious with someone.
- I don't understand.
- It means it's someone you know.
Or knows you, and they only attack when you've committed to someone.
I've devised a plan to draw out the attacker.
We just need Mina I need to stop you right there.
Mina's gone.
What?
- You didn't kill her, did you?
- Gus, please, some decorum.
- You didn't, right?
- No!
I put her on a plane.
I broke it off with her.
Maybe I was just meant to be alone.
You would rather lose her than see the possibility of harm come to her.
You love her that much?
- I don't know any other way to love.
- Really?
Have you seen 9 1/2 weeks?
Or any of Zalman King's other stuff?
- What's the plan?
- It's not important now.
We were going to dangle Mina out to lure the killer to attack.
You were gonna make the woman I love, the woman I would give my life for - You were gonna make her bait?
- Bait?
That's a strong fishing term.
We were gonna make her an incentive, since the attacker's only pattern is to keep you from finding love.
I have an idea.
Man, I don't like this.
- You don't like Julia dating somebody.
- Fake dating.
But that's not it.
It's this whole "using her as bait" thing.
You had no problem dangling his girlfriend as bait.
Now you're changing the rules, aren't you?
Look at Raj.
He's getting awfully "handsy" over there, taking advantage of the situation like that.
No, he's definitely bugged by O'Hara dating this guy.
Don't leave the talk button on.
That was so good.
I've never had broccoli in a milkshake before.
But just think how good it is for you.
Well, well, well.
It's 11:20.
Look who finally decided to come home.
I'm sorry, Shawn.
- Are you upset about something?
- As a matter of fact, I am What did I do?
I didn't like this idea to begin with.
You've been on four dates now.
It's been a complete and total failure.
No, Shawn, we've been on three dates.
No, there was the carnival, where Raj won you a big, fat octopus.
There was a long walk on the pier, where he kept brushing your hair gently.
Then there was dinner tonight, where there was a lot of hand-holding.
Who could forget coffee at the police department, where you blushed and squealed and giggled like a schoolgirl?
He was there to sign some papers.
- You were watching us?
- It's called surveillance.
I "surveillate" things.
I'm a purveyor of "surveillerism".
Let's not get caught up in wordplay.
The point is, we've been at this charade for 3 weeks, and it's yielded a grand total of nada.
- You're right.
- Of course I am.
You see that?
It's clear that the killer doesn't think detective O'Hara is my girlfriend, or maybe they know I'm still in love with Mina.
We can keep at this for six months, we're still not gonna get anywhere.
Unless we did something to remove all doubt, something big.
You said it yourself, it happens when Raj gets serious.
Right.
Your entire family's going to the Holi Festival this weekend?
I have another idea.
You want to get married?
This is so considerate of you.
I always wanted to go to the Festival when I was in India.
Yes, I sensed that.
I'm aware of your immense love for traditional festivals of colors.
There also might be a killer here, and I may need you to block an exit.
What?
Fresh laddu.
There's Mrs. Singh.
She hates me, and people don't hate me.
I get cards from people I arrest.
She doesn't hate you, okay?
Apparently I don't fit the picture of what her perfect Raj deserves.
I am smart, and I am fun, and I am almost always in a good mood.
You're not actually marrying Raj, remember?
- Let's just get this show on the road.
- Please.
Hello, everybody.
I see that a lot of my family are here today, and I wanted to share some great news with you.
As many of you know, I've had some trying times lately.
I lost a love that I thought was true and had some trouble within my family.
But this woman here, this beautiful angel has been my savior.
And I know that a lot of you will think it's crazy, and it may be impulsive, but I've asked my beautiful Juliet to marry me, and she accepted.
All right.
Looks like people bought it.
Now we just have to wait.
And watch.
Is it too early for a snack?
We've been here five minutes.
All right, I admit it.
I was wrong about the brother.
- We should call a truce.
- That's awfully big of you.
Detective, might I have a word with you?
What can I do fo Wait a minute.
You're the guy from the theater, right?
I didn't tell you everything the day you questioned me.
On that night just before the accident, I overheard Mina and the Raj guy talking I hate having to hide what we have.
You know we can't really be together until you tell her.
I will.
Soon.
He was seeing someone else.
Mina was going to expose the affair, giving Raj motive for murder.
He wasn't distraught because he almost lost his girlfriend.
It was guilt over trying to kill her.
His first confession was real.
Who, exactly, is responsible?
I am.
I hurt them all.
I'm a danger to everyone around me.
I solved it.
It was Raj.
Truce over.
- You can't take back a truce.
- You coming with me or not?
Raj wouldn't cheat on his taxes, much less his girlfriend.
I'll take that as a no.
Tell him, you can't take back a truce.
Indian giver!
I meant to insult an entirely different group of Indians.
Sorry about that.
You can't endanger Juliet over a gripe with Lassiter.
I'm not.
You heard the dude from Temple of Doom.
Raj was hiding his relationship, but from who?
That's who we're looking for.
And Lassiter's following Raj, who didn't do it.
Then who exactly is watching Jules?
There!
What happened?
Where's Juliet?
I got hit from behind.
Next thing I knew, she was gone.
Did you see who?
- No, it all happened so fast.
- Do you want me to call an ambulance?
I'm fine.
Spread out, everybody.
I want eyes on my partner in 5 minutes.
You, take a break.
Have a sweet ball.
Excuse me.
There!
It's gonna be okay, Sita.
Just take it easy.
I know what's going on.
- You do?
- Of course I do.
Shut up!
Don't come any closer.
I can see I can see it all.
You met Jay.
He proposed.
You accepted.
Then you starting hanging out with the family, mostly Raj.
That's when you realized you were truly in love with Raj, not your fiance.
But you were stuck.
You couldn't call off the engagement, make a play for Raj.
He would never do that to his brother.
So what did you do?
Really, dude?
Really?
- Where was I?
- She was stuck.
Right.
You were stuck, engaged to one man but in love with his brother.
So you decided to take action.
First, you did everything you could to delay your wedding to Jay.
We could push the wedding date, if it means that much to you.
Then, you sabotaged all of Raj's relationships, waiting for a time when both of you were free, convincing him that he would be by himself for the rest of time, making it easier for you to swoop in at the right moment.
Poor Mina, she was the easiest one of all.
Nobody was gonna question why you were hanging around.
After all, you were engaged to the choreographer.
You swing by, you say, "hi," and that's what granted you access to the crew's trucks.
Probably even had blueprints and keys to the theater.
You even watched the rehearsal to see if the dance steps changed.
Get back.
I'm gonna kill her.
She can't have what I want, because he's mine.
Me and Raj, we're meant to be together.
Let her go.
Let her go, and all of this will be much easier for you.
You were You were crazy in love.
Any fool could see what would drive you to do this.
Word of advice, when you take someone hostage, you might want to check for weapons.
Drop the knife.
Drop it.
- Did Abigail see that?
- I'm here.
Yes, you are.
The pain surprised me.
And I wasn't supposed to get slapped by a girl.
It's a process.
It is a process.
- What'd I miss?
- Not me getting slapped.
- By a girl.
- 'Cause that didn't happen.
You're caught Assaulting a cop and tons of witnesses.
You're not gonna get away.
Have fun with shock therapy.
I got a wedding invitation from Raj and Mina.
It feels good, bringing people together, watching them sail off into the sunset, giving a good guy the old happily-ever-after.
I felt for Raj.
End of the day, we had a great deal in common.
You gonna go?
I barely knew that dude.
And this, Abigail, is where we end our tour, because right here is where I choose not to gloat when I've gotten the best of Lassie.
Right here?
It's more all All-overish, I guess.
But I've never done that, though there's a 1st time for everything.
Color me impressed.
I'd rather color you with edible body paints.
Duly noted.
Besides, it's not that impressive.
I solve a case every week and usually one around christmas.
It was so impressive the way you just attacked that mad woman with a knife.
It says so much about your character, about how you feel.
How I feel?
You risked your life for a random coworker.
She's not random.
What I mean is, it's part of the job.
I would do that for anybody Colleague, coworker, Corey Haim once.
Wouldn't do it again, to be honest.
Never got a thank you, and I'm sure he stole my medic alert bracelet.
- You have one of those?
- It's Gus'.
Long story.
So am I fingerprinting you or what?
It's fun, but you'll have little black fingers for, like, a month.
Three stores have been hit in 15 minutes.
Units are in pursuit of the suspects.
Let's roll!
Go ahead.
I got the last one.
We'll let Lassie have this one.
Want to do a fake mug shot instead?
Are you kidding me right now?
We'll need costumes.
Where did I put the key to the evidence locker?
The holding cells.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Dad, can I please get a home computer?
Mrs. Phillips said it would help prepare me for the future.
Get your head out of the clouds.
Those things are another passing fad like rap music, Madonna, and L.A. Law.
Here.
Why don't you focus on something that might make you some money one day.
All right?
I didn't see anything.
I swear.
Please don't shoot me.
Don't worry.
We're not gonna shoot you.
How do you not have a black suit?
What grown man doesn't own a black suit?
Besides me, the joker, colonel Sanders, Matthew McConaughey?
He doesn't count.
He doesn't own a shirt.
- He doesn't need a shirt.
- You know that's right.
Sit down.
- So that's them, huh?
- Yes, unfortunately.
Come on, man, it's been ten years.
Can't you guys just hug it out?
And for the last time, I'm here to say one final good-bye to Leonard.
He was a good friend.
And then that's it we're out.
Thanks for coming.
Dearly beloved, we gather here today not to mourn a death, but to celebrate a life.
Can I give an amen if the preacher guy asks for it?
Of course.
But wait for it.
Leonard Callahan, or "Diddle", as he was known to those closest to him - Diddle?
- We all had nicknames, Shawn.
was tragically taken from us by a hit-and-run driver.
But we know Diddle is in a better place now.
Diddle is in a better place now.
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen!
And he continues to live - in our hearts.
- Hallelujah!
- Sit down!
- Got caught up in the moment.
- I was in the moment.
- And now, in light of his home-going service, Leonard's former bandmates from college would like to dedicate a special song to his memory.
He was in a band.
That's cool.
- What are you doing?
- To pay my respects.
Be quiet.
Get back here!
I can't believe you've been holding out on me for all these years.
It's one of my lifelong dreams to be part of a 4-piece singing group.
Five-piece was my backup.
Now I find out not only were you in one, you let it all slip away - I must know why, I must!
- Enough, Shawn.
That was like a new edition reunion concert minus Bobby and Ronnie.
What could have come between men capable of creating such sweet harmony?
Gimme a hint.
You can give me a baby hint.
All right, fine.
I wish I could have known you when you were black.
You're the psychic.
Yes.
Uh, Shawn Spencer.
I'm Tony.
This is Joon.
We read about yours and Gus's detective agency in our alumni newsletter.
Look, I gotta tell you guys, you sounded amazing up there.
- I do a little singing myself.
- Yeah, thanks.
Diddle was the heart and soul of our group.
The day he was taken from us was the day the music died.
I just keep thinking he can't be dead He can't be!
And then I look at that casket and I'm like That's gotta be Diddle in there.
Because why would they put his picture on another dude's coffin?
And that's when I lose it!
So tragic.
Look, man We don't think that Diddle died in any bicycle accident.
I mean, he was the only brother I knew who rode a bicycle as a grown man.
We think he was murdered.
- Have you notified the police?
- What if they did it?
Normally We wouldn't even associate ourselves with somebody who would partner up with a buster like Gus.
- Buster!
- But I checked out that newsletter, and it seem like you are pretty good at solving stuff without a lot of evidence.
- The less evidence, the better.
- Good.
'Cause Diddle doesn't deserve to go out like that.
Not him.
I mean, the man was barely 5'10" and could dunk with two hands!
- There I go again.
- It's okay, it's all right.
Can we hire you?
You know, man, I think that might be a little complicated.
Then again What are best friends of mysteriously estranged old college pals for?
Psych 407 "High Top Fade Out" Timing: Psych Team G-whiz.
- Joon.
- Sweet!
Now that that's out of the way, let's go ahead and bring Gus up to speed.
Fine.
It all started when we got this weird email from Diddle on the day that he died.
- "It's so hard to say good-bye".
- There's a huge file attached to it.
It's not like any file I've ever seen.
And it's heavily encrypted.
It can't be opened.
We can't figure out what the message means, but it has something to do with him dying.
You're listed as a recipient here.
Do you remember getting this email?
I got it, and I immediately proceeded to place it into the trash bin.
That's cold, B. Yo, that's like Beyonce and the first destiny's child cold.
Me and Diddles' relationship was rock solid.
We never lost contact.
But he would send us these emails about getting the group back together, which involve reconciling with these jokers, - and that was not gonna happen.
- Not happenin'.
Not even if Jesus was our manager.
You're not serious about that.
- No, I ain't serious.
I was playin'.
- All right.
Then it's settled.
There'll be no reunion unless Jesus agrees to manage the group.
That's fine by me.
If Jesus was our manager he would bring us all together We aren't gonna sing our problems away.
Look, you guys, whatever happened between you, it happened a long time ago.
You've clearly suffered a great loss.
Look at the bright side.
You've the opportunity to make Diddles' wish come true.
Yeah, but look at the dark side.
Being together makes a bad situation worse.
Look on the dark side?
Who talks like that?
The most negative dude I know.
Okay, guys, let's just Let's get the email up and we'll see what's what.
Call me negative.
He's been doing that all these years.
- I read the purpose driven life!
- Man, transformation equals change.
- It's encrypted, all right.
- Well, de-cryptify it.
You can't just un-encrypt something.
You need a data key, a pass code, a complex algorithm.
Whatever this file is, he went out of his way to protect it.
- Diddle worked for Cybervault.
- I know.
- Diddle worked for Cybervault.
- This dude Companies hire them to protect and encrypt data sent over networks.
So they can or cannot lift the parental lock on my laptop?
That was me.
It was for your own good.
They protect credit card transactions, trade secrets, classified government documents.
Those guys are running some big brother-type stuff over there.
We think Diddle maybe stumbled across some secret information somebody was trying to get their hands on.
Now you feel where we're comin' from.
How'bout you, Gus?
Oh, man.
He's not even hearing it, much less feelin' it.
It's clear to the 3 of us that you're neither hearing it nor feeling it.
What I can't discern is are you mad at it?
All right.
We need to retrace Diddles' final steps.
Diddles' time of death was pegged right after he sent the email.
- So he had just left the apartment.
- Brilliant!
We'll start there.
We're helping the family collect his things so we can gain full access.
No, he didn't keep these.
What?
Let me see, let me see.
- Mine still fits!
- Mine does too.
Like yesterday.
Let's do the steps.
All right.
Mine smells like mothballs.
- Yeah, mine smells like mold.
- Like my grandmama feet.
- You think I could have Diddles'?
- No.
Let's get back to work.
Let me ask you something.
Was he always this safety-conscious?
Once in college, he left his seatbelt on during a drive-in movie.
He's not the guy that would go cycling without his protective cycling gear.
Good point.
Check that out.
Who uses a power strip for one plug?
I'm sensing that some of Diddles' computer equipment has been stolen and that there is more going on here than meets the eye.
Hi, Jules.
Hi, old penguin from Happy feet.
- What do you got?
- I'm so sorry to hear that Leonard is a friend of yours, Gus, but we looked at it again, and we agree with the initial assessment.
Even though it was a grisly accident, it is a straightforward hit and run.
That's it?
Can we look into it?
I'm afraid not.
City's cutting down on wasteful spending.
That includes all non-essential expenditures.
And we already have a team on that, so no need for a psychic consultation.
Anything else?
Did Lassiter throw his voice into your mouth?
Because that's really unsanitary.
That's nice work.
Shoo, flies.
If I could just get a psychic reading on the autopsy report Gosh, I'm sorry, see that would require one meeting with the new coroner which requires an official police detail which one does not have because one is not welcome here.
Shoo.
And we're shooing.
We're shooing.
We're shooing.
Auf wiedersehen.
Sweet.
You heard Lassiter.
We need a police detail.
Don't be the American adaptation of the British Gus.
- I'm not impersonating a coroner.
- Fine.
You're on your own then.
It's the one without any teeth.
Tell me what to do!
My knees and calves are locking up!
- You must be out of your damn mind!
- Do it for Diddle.
- I get claustrophobic.
- You're a cadaver.
Cover you because cadavers don't wear shirts from Abercrombie and fletch.
It's Abercrombie and Fitch.
And, no, you haven't heard it both ways!
- Hey there.
- Hi.
- You must be the new coroner.
- I just transferred over.
But don't worry, I've been playing with dead things since I was a toddler.
I'm Shawn Spencer.
This dead body here is detective Miles.
- Another one of the good guys, huh?
- No, sir.
His first name is detective.
Of course.
Well, leave him right there while I prepare a toe tag.
You got it.
You know, an emt buddy of mine said he brought in a hit and run victim the other day.
Nasty stuff, huh?
I worked that specimen.
It was pretty bad but consistent with an automobile/cycling collision Multiple cranial fractures, crushed larynx, fractured hyoid bone, contusions this, blunt force trauma that.
Stupid government pens.
I'll be right back.
A crushed larynx and broken hyoid could also be consistent with asphyxiation.
- Did you say a token hemorrhoid?
- I said broken hyoid Yeah, you know what?
That's pretty much what he said.
Then he went on to say something pretty crazy.
That the crushed larynx and hyoid could have meant that he was asphyxiated.
Asphyxiation?
- That wouldn't make any sense.
- That's what I said.
Unless this crash was postmortem.
That was my Caruso.
Not bad, right?
Oh, man!
I'm gonna need another release form.
I filled this out in farsi by mistake.
I've been using the rosetta stone to learn new languages in my down time.
That computer software really works, huh?
Wait a second.
There's software called the rosetta stone too?
- You got me!
Touche!
- Revenge!
I've got some more release forms in the back, you boob!
Dude, did you hear that?
He said someone could have used the accident to cover up the way that Diddle died.
They were right.
This was murder!
Is the guy still here?
He's in the back.
I really didn't mind him though.
Yeah.
He's a real character.
Can we get outta here?
Poor Diddle.
They probably threatened to torture him first then tortured him second.
Then they threatened to kill him third.
Then they killed him fourth.
Stop making up conspiracy theories.
You don't know if they tortured him.
I do know, because that's what they do.
- Who is "they"?
- "Them".
He should've just played dead.
I always say that's what I would do if somebody was trying to kill me Just play dead.
I mean, they'd be like "we're gonna kill you"!
And then I'd be like dead.
Then they'd be like, "He's dead.
Let's go kill somebody else".
- And then they would leave.
- Guys, I'm afraid I have more bad news.
Whoever they are, they might know that Diddle emailed the 3 of you the file.
You guys could be in some serious danger.
- I didn't get any email.
- What?
- We all got the email.
- Y'all got it I didn't.
You can't pretend you're not a part of this.
- I don't even have a computer.
- You do too!
- I didn't get the email either then.
- You would even sell out each other.
Don't talk to me, crazy.
I didn't get it.
Let's get outta here.
My mama bought me that car!
I'm not with you!
- Okay, here's the deal.
- Now do you believe there's a case?
We need to see if the bomb squad has any evidence we can trace - like residue, fragments, detonators - Slow down.
Nobody said anything about you being put on this case.
It's not that simple anymore.
We're under direct orders from Vick.
Now, clearly, something's going on, but the top brass has instituted a whole new layer of protocol.
The first thing we need to do is run full background checks on your pals, make sure all doesn't start with them.
- You are kidding, right?
- No, I'm not, Guster.
Your attitude confirms that this case presents a conflict of interest for you, which is precisely why you won't be getting involved.
- What do we do in the meantime?
- Just sit tight.
And take the bus.
What?
Too soon?
All right, Jules, I'm now entering our cone of confidentiality.
Get to the point.
I'm really busy.
Let's be honest with each other.
This is you paying me back for the awkwardness and tension that I've allowed Abigail to cause between us.
Contrary to what you may think, Shawn, it isn't always about you.
When I open an investigation, I have to answer to people in authority above me.
I understand.
Especially if, by contrary to what I believe, it isn't always about me, and when you open an investigation you have to answer to people in authority above you, you mean it's because of Abigail.
I'm supposed to giggle, because your charm is just too irresistible?
Almost.
I was gonna bring it home doing both sides of the conversation using my high-pitched eighth grade Jules voice.
I'm sure that your girlfriend appreciates you using her as a tactic to scam information.
Gold star, Shawn.
Really.
Well?
Crashed and burned.
Then somehow crashed again in Chile, only to be eaten by my soccer teammates.
We're on our own.
That much is clear.
We'll stash Tony and Joon at my dad's place.
That way we can focus on the case.
We need to figure out what was on that encrypted file.
It was way too complicated for any normal person to crack.
Then we'll find someplace with people just as smart as Diddle like a chemistry lab or - Cybervault?
- What?
Bringing your good stuff today, man.
I'll figure out the processing power we'll need to run our localized servers and report it to I.T. - Better yet, you do it.
- Copy.
And what about the open source coding seminar?
I know it's important.
I don't have the time.
Here's an idea.
I'll do it.
Let me take the lead on this one.
You're way out of your element here.
Make it quick.
Thank you for taking the time to speak with us, sir.
My name is Gus Brown, and this is my associate Shawn White.
We're friends of Leonard Callahan, and we're wondering if someone could help us with one of his encrypted files.
I doubt it.
Leonard was the best we had.
No one could break his encryptions.
He even had patents on them.
I can't even figure out what he was working on before he died.
I don't suppose either of you can create an 802.1q spanning tree loop using auto forwarding non-wintel based equipment?
I can make a straw wrapper crawl like a worm.
And make the inside of my elbow look like a butt.
- Thank you for your time.
- See?
Dude, it's Diddle's cubicle.
Maybe there's a clue there about what was on that encrypted file.
That's just what I was thinking.
This guy's almost as organized as you are.
Those brothers, they couldn't color-tab their way out of the staples.
You're on them cause they're not anal-retentive enough?
- What happened between you?
- Move on.
Dude, I've always wanted to do this.
Look what I just did.
I'm like Mr. Wizard.
I wonder what was so important about those addresses.
- That's interesting.
- What?
Your boy liked big butts, and I cannot lie.
What?
Looks like Diddle had a little stalker in him.
Diddle was a saint, Shawn.
Don't talk about him like that.
I'm not mad at him.
Excuse us.
We were never formally introduced.
I'm world-renowned psychic/lothario Shawn Spencer.
- This is my associate - Gus.
But you can call me John Slade.
I'm Chelsea.
I'm getting a psychic transmission right here as we speak, Chelsea.
A fleeting glance a stolen moment between coworkers.
Leonard had a little thing for you.
- How'd you know that?
- Psych psychic I'm I could always tell, the way he'd hold the door for me or offer to help carry my files.
He finally got up the nerve to ask me out right before he He was very sweet.
You don't meet many guys like that these days.
There, there.
I know how you feel.
Do you recall anything unusual about his final days?
We just started talking.
I never got to know him all that well.
He sure loved his music, though.
Always humming or riffing on songs over there in his cubicle.
Talking about some group he used to sing with back in college.
Blackapella.
I was a part of that group, but Anyway.
If you can think of anything else or if you just need someone to talk to, please Feel free to give us a call.
This is my work card, but my personal cell number's on the back.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chelsea.
All right.
Dude, you realize that's the third variation of "my work card with my some other number on the back in pencil" move that you've used this month alone?
It's called showing off my penmanship, Shawn.
Ancient culture saw it as a sign of virility.
- Shut up.
- It hurts.
Dad.
We left them here to keep them safe.
- Who did this?
- They did.
Damn fools shot themselves.
Who the hell left them with a BB gun?
I did.
They said they wanted to be able to defend themselves.
Dumb move.
Calm down.
The BB bounced off you.
It's like you're made of rubber.
I thought you two were wusses.
You're commandoes compared to them.
Please tell me you're onto something, 'cause our lives may depend on it.
- You can say that again.
- Don't you worry.
My meta-ethereal game is as tight as Gus's workout shorts.
Checking some addresses here that are psychically linked to Diddle.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
This is John Slade.
Hey, Chelsea.
How you doing?
No.
I'm glad you called.
Drinks later?
Okay, sure.
All right.
Who the hell is John Slade?
Hell, no, B. I know you not using Diddle's death to get some play with that shorty.
All I did was give her my number in case she need to talk.
Let me guess.
Did you write it out for her so she could see your good penmanship?
- I taught you that move, B. - Say it ain't so, B. - Who the hell is B?
- Everyone but you.
Gus will always sell out his boys for some woman.
- Amen to that.
- What?
Last week, you left me at a Coco's to help a chick to move a table.
Sister had green eyes.
That's a special circumstance.
Doesn't surprise me.
Gus has never honored the code.
- So you wanna go there?
- We can go there.
- You sure?
- We can.
- You wanna bring up the past.
- Absolutely.
It hasn't really been long enough, okay?
It still kinda cuts deep like a machete in the bush.
I'm the one that should be hurt.
You two slept with my girlfriend.
- She wasn't your girlfriend.
- She was a groupie!
An a cappella groupie?
That exists?
It was college, B. We had the matching jackets And free biscuits and gravy after every show.
It doesn't matter what you two saw her as.
I was way into her and she was into me, and you knew that.
You don't fall in love with a groupie.
That's part of the code!
Even Patrick Fugit knows that.
You don't sleep with your mate's girl.
That's the code!
I thought the code was about not having a fling with your best friend's sister.
Wait a minute.
You hooked up with Joy?
- My hero!
- Gimme some.
- Stop it, Shawn.
- No, you stop it, G-Whiz.
You broke up Blackapella, man.
We were going places!
The whole world was our oyster, man.
Everybody loved us.
Did you see that video at the funeral?
We looked like idiots.
Those were hammer pants.
Five years behind the curve.
It wasn't about that.
We played shows at the student center and the Cinnamon Festival, that's it.
It was about college and friendship and having the best times of our lives.
And you betrayed me.
The both of you.
Got your minds mixed up in nonsense, and it broke my heart!
We're all over this case, okay?
We're gonna check out these addresses, and we will report back what we find.
In the meantime, you two stay put.
Diddle was here the night that he died.
That's messed up.
What the I specifically told you guys to stay at my dad's.
But then you gave us the nod.
So clearly you were saying, don't trust something this important to Gus, B. No.
I'm not nearly adept enough at using "B" to work it into a nod.
I was saying, "good-bye for now".
I told you not to mess with the nod.
Never.
You've never once said that to me.
Bottom line If you want this case to get solved, you have to trust us, and you have to stay away.
You're targets, remember?
- All right.
- Bet.
We're gonna check this out.
You go back to my dad's and stay put.
We'll check in with you later.
We'll wait five minutes and then follow them inside with the BB guns.
You know that's right.
It looks like this party's over.
It actually looks suspiciously like Steve Martin's office in The Spanish Prisoner.
Help!
Help!
They got Tony and Joon!
- Tell me you have a plan.
- Sit down.
We'll be doing the talking.
Two of my friends are missing, and I'm next on the list.
- I'm entitled to - You're entitled to nothing.
And as far as your friends go, you've got yourself to blame for them.
You must be out of your damn mind.
Enough, both of you.
Gus, I know this must be difficult, but Lassiter is right Your friends had no business being near that warehouse.
They followed us.
What were we supposed to do?
We tried to stash them at my dad's.
They bolted while he was on the throne.
We told you there was something rotten in Sweden, but you wouldn't listen.
I am ordering you two to lay low and stay out of our way.
We will call you when we find your friends.
And Shawn, if you are feeling anything, you better tell us right now.
Really?
Would that be useful?
I'm gonna put my energy into making sure that my best friend isn't the next domino to fall, since that's the least of your concerns.
- We just - Just nothing.
Time is wasting.
Let's go, O'Hara.
Come on.
I know what'll make you feel better.
- Feel better?
- A little.
I never wanted to punch Lassiter before today.
- Really?
- The worst part is that he's right.
Tony and Joon are not detectives.
They had no business being there.
They're grown men with free will.
There's so many things left unsaid.
All those years of radio silence I wish I had a chance to tell them how I truly felt.
You have had countless opportunities in the last 48 hours alone.
You know what?
You should have sang that song you came up with for our high school.
Same one you sang for the principal in the bathroom.
That's fromlean on me, and you know it.
Don't act like you really care.
The reason why you took this case is because you wanted to sing in our group.
All right, look I'll admit the thought may have crossed my mind very briefly.
The truth is, I took this case because I got freaked that you could have a falling out with dudes that used to be so close.
If it could happen to you, then it could happen to us.
Don't you realize that none of the myriad of stupid, selfish, and ultimately life-threatening stunts you pulled over the years could do it?
It's probably not gonna happen.
So what do you wanna do?
We should probably hide you somewhere.
What would we do if we were still on the case and looking for them?
Whatever Diddle was tracking, the second warehouse on his list is probably next, so we throw caution to the wind, dress up like american ninjas, and check it out.
- I don't wanna get shot, Shawn.
- Just stay low.
You'll be the lookout.
Good 'cause I can look out from outside.
Get back here!
That's weird.
What?
What is it?
There's one hair on my knuckle that's like twice as long as all the other ones.
What do you see, Shawn?
Dude.
It's some sort of secret deal.
With briefcases.
It looks super-shady.
How did Diddle get himself mixed up in all of that?
He was the smartest, most responsible brother in our group.
It's drugs.
This is all about drugs?
The weird guy from the funeral is here!
- What is Reverend Watkins doing here?
- It's not Reverend Watkins!
- Who is it?
- The weird guy with the scar.
He left early, I told you.
That's a lotta dough.
This is straight out of To Live and Die in L.A.
They put their pinky in the blow and taste it to see if it's good?
He just did.
It's good.
It's really good.
Dude, he double-dipped.
- That's unsanitary!
- Not if it's for his personal stash.
- We don't know.
- Do you see Tony and Joon?
Don't come up!
There's not room for you up here!
They're not here.
But I bet one of these b-holes can lead us right to them.
I say we go back to the car, wait, and then follow the guy with the scar.
- That rhymed.
- Hello.
What are you doing?
He heard that!
- It's my phone!
- Turn it off.
- I'm trying to.
- Who could be calling you at this You are!
I tell you about putting your phone in your back pocket.
That's ridiculous!
It is me.
It is me.
Who are you?
You move, and I paint this wall with your brain matter.
Now, who the hell sent you?
You wouldn't believe us.
Try me.
Mikhail - Dudikoff.
- Russian mob?
American ninjas.
Hello.
Get in the car!
I don't wanna get tortured, Shawn.
Shut up!
You two have managed to stumble into the biggest undercover operation - in this department's history!
- Where are Tony and Joon?
Tony and Joon are safe and sound in the room right next door.
Joon is on his third doughnut.
This is detective Moses Johnson from narcotics.
He's our inside man.
We simply couldn't risk exposing him.
You two Sure have a propensity for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It's a refined skill.
Keeping track of you two is getting sticky.
That's why we scooped up your two friends.
Last night, you literally landed in the lion's den.
I'll be in the conference room.
How in the hell could you not tell us about this?
- We are members of this team!
- We solve a murder a week.
- Why did you leave us here all night?
- It was for your own protection.
What is all of this about, and what did Diddle get himself into?
The SBPD uses undisclosed warehouses to store the caches of drugs and weapons they seize from busts.
The street value on this contraband is astronomical.
Somebody cracked our network system, discovered these locations, and stole the confiscated drugs.
Detective Johnson was undercover as a drug lord trying to make a score.
Diddle worked for Cybervault.
They protect credit card transactions, trade secrets, classified government documents.
I can see it.
Sbpd contracts Cybervault to do their network security.
It's probably their biggest account.
We didn't make the connection until you came saying that your friend's death wasn't an accident.
Diddle discovered a workaround in his company's code One that would allow someone to access any of their clients' protected network communications.
He tried to take it to his supervisor, got blown off, and then he went and followed the evidence for himself.
Your buddy was one smart cookie.
He got close enough to the rat to catch him making the deal with the bad guy on video.
Which is what we think he attached to the email.
He also managed to get himself killed.
Tony and Joon gave us the file.
We've had one of our best techies working on it with no luck as of yet.
They've tried every decryption algorithm.
I'm really sorry.
Your friend Leonard really seemed like a stand-up guy.
I can't believe this.
- Man, it's good to see you too.
- Man, we thought we was dead for sure.
Tony started praying out loud in the back of the car, so then the scary Sugar Hill dude was like, "shut the hell up back there"!
- Tell 'em what I said .
- Then I said, "man, don't you know when it's time to keep your mouth shut"?
You understand me?
I was thinking words in my head, but I wasn't saying them.
See?
In my mind, I was like None of this would have happened if we'd have got the group back together like Diddle always wanted us to.
Right?
He sure loved his music, though.
So then when the bad dude with the gun was like, "shut up"!
I was just like Because my mama taught me from a very early age very early age I would say four, five, or six She was like, "all you need in this world Basic morals, values, and respect".
Joon, shut up!
It's so hard to say good-bye.
Diddle gave us everything we need.
I gotta see the encryption on this file.
You guys Warm up your voices.
Follow me!
- Not now, Spencer.
- No, I think I got it.
Right.
I've run every algorithm imaginable.
There are four separate locks, and I can't see a pattern anywhere.
It's not what you can't see.
It's what you can't hear.
- May I?
- Be my guest.
Fellas.
It's so hard to say good-bye.
Just like the old days, minus the hair and satin.
It's working!
- The last strip?
- There were four of us.
The harmony.
I got it!
I'll do it.
That can't be.
Wait a second.
- That's the rat?
- Who is that?
Let's go!
Babies.
Chelsea Patterson.
You're under arrest.
What is this - John Slade?
- It's the end of the road.
Leonard discovered the leak in your security code and reported it to your supervisor who, as always, passed it off to you.
Copy.
Unlike my friend, you didn't do the noble thing and decided to try and get yours.
You used the leak to acquire the locations of the SBPD warehouses and then sold that information to a drug kingpin.
Diddle caught it all on camera.
He wasn't creepily checking out your posterior.
- That's not creepy at all.
- He was investigating you.
You felt horrible that your dealings led to his death, but by then the damage was already done.
Because of you, those same drug dealers went after Gus, Tony, and Joon.
I'm officially canceling drinks.
- Probably.
- Nobody was supposed to get hurt.
Least of all Leonard.
I'm sorry.
You'll have plenty of time to think about that.
In fact, we might be able to cut into some of that if you were to name some names and lead us to your associates.
Do it for Diddle.
Nice work, guys.
- No thanks to you.
- Especially you.
I can't believe you didn't let us in.
I thought we were on the same team.
You are not a cop, Spencer.
You never will be.
Thank god for that, B. I heard singing.
What's going on?
Tony's cousin's getting married next week, and one of the singers fell out, - so we're stepping in.
- We need a fourth.
- Only question is, are you down?
- Are you kidding me?
With Shawn part of the group, we can't use our old name.
Blackapella?
- True, that.
- I've Actually given this some thought.
I think I got it.
What?
Quarterblack.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes perfect sense.
It's math.
One of me and three of you.
Quarterblack would be one black and three white.
No, wait.
I like the ring of that.
Quarterblack.
It's like we're all Randall Cunninghams.
Three to one.
I think that's settled.
Quarterblack it is.
That's not how it works.
We don't vote.
Who thinks we should start voting?
Who's hungry?
Who thinks Gus should pay?
You know what?
I'm out.
I should have known better.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Shawn, we shouldn't left our troop.
Dude, this is a chance to put our skills to a real test.
What was that?
It was nothing.
Your little lil'chief senses are off.
Okay, tell me you didn't hear that.
Probably just a giant beaver.
A giant beaver?
Dagnabbit, what is it?
Run!
Wandering off is about the dumbest thing you've ever done.
Do you know how dense this forest is?
Dense enough for a werewolf to run amok and swallow me like a rollo.
- Werewolves, huh?
- Yeah, didn't you hear them?
The mind can convince itself of almost anything when fear is involved.
But fear does not exist in this dojo, does it, boys?
Help me.
We're out of here.
The following is the royal rumble!
"Hacksaw" Jim Duggan.
Winner of the first-ever rumble in 1988.
- Old school.
- You even got the 2x4.
All right.
Look at you.
We both went retro.
Although he should have a vast and unruly beard.
I didn't want to draw on his face.
But don't worry, the most important component is still intact.
What?
Sylvester Ritter, aka Junkyard Dog.
The most prolific and electrifying wrestler of his time.
May he rest in peace.
Amen.
Is it a little weird that we still This might have to be the last year for the dolls.
Kinda creepy.
Let's cover them with something.
Hurry.
Please say you're the psychic detectives please.
I'm the psychic detective.
He just has a magic 8-ball head.
Okay, terrific.
Okay, this is good.
Stewart Gimbley.
I need you to lock me up and observe my behavior overnight.
You're my last hope.
- Dude!
- No, it's for your own protection.
Are those silver bullets?
I went to the cops, and I told them to put me in a cell.
And the detective said, "jail is for criminals, not delusional whackadoos".
He said "whackadoos"?
And then he pinched himself and told me to come see you guys.
And what, exactly, does this detective look like?
Imagine Robert Goulet dressed like Mr. Bean playing the scarecrow in a summer stock production of the Wizard of oz, dedicated to Tony Randall.
So, Stewart, why do you feel you need to be locked up and observed?
I'm almost positive I'm a lycan.
Lichen?
Like seaweed?
No, a lycan.
You mean a lychee.
- Like sheep's wool.
- Lychee is a drupe fruit.
A lycan.
Lycanthrope.
Werewolf?
What?
"Dee's nuts".
I don't get it.
I think I did that last night.
You think you killed a little lamb?
Tonight could be much worse.
I was gonna ask my sister to watch me, but I love her and clearly fear for her safety.
- Rumble's about to start any second.
- It's on.
- I don't really feel like - I can pay you thrice your normal rate.
I'm not doing it for half price, I'll tell you that.
That's three times the amount.
- I've heard it both ways.
- No, you haven't.
It's starting.
- The rumble's on.
- We can throw him in the corner.
- It's a lot of money.
- It's not like he's really a werewolf.
House rules are as follows.
One - No talking during the rumble.
- Two You leave here at sunrise, never ever, ever come back again.
And three Touch the quatro queso dos fritos and I will take you down using basic, traditional beginner's karate.
Deal.
You are truly lifesavers.
Now, please, bind my extremities as best you can.
Proving time and again here tonight.
Hacksaw is just hammering away.
He's hitting everybody in sight.
- You sure you guys can handle this?
- Please, Stew, we're professionals.
Psych 408 "Let's Get Hairy" Timing: Psych Team I got something.
Right there.
Let's send Bambi back to ma.
On my word.
Ready Now!
Red?
What the Who's there?
Who's there?
I will blow you to kingdom come.
You hear me?
You are messing with the wrong son of a b Damn it, I told you to stop doing that.
It's like watching someone while they sleep.
Why were you reading that file like Mr. Peanut?
I was curious.
Several distinguished military strategists throughout history But you know what, I don't need to explain myself to the likes of you.
"Dee's nuts"?
Stewart Gimbley.
Ring any bells?
Yay high, yellow eyes, howls at the moon.
This guy spent last night chained up in our office until he escaped and jumped through our double-paned window.
- It's not even sort of double-paned.
- Wait.
He broke through his chains?
Figuratively, yes.
Literally, it was duct tape and kite string.
He chewed his way out with his big, bad teeth, all the better to eat you with.
We were sleeping, so we can't confirm how pointy his ears were.
- I didn't say ears.
- That's what I heard.
Me too.
And now we have a broken window that you should pay for.
Fat chance.
Here.
Why don't you go look for your lost pet at his place of business.
"Occultopuss"?
Even though I wouldn't lock him up because he was from the planet Wolfen, he still told me to come down and have my palm read by his sister Willow.
You're saying you've worn that shirt for at least two days in a row.
- Remove yourself from this place.
- You sure you don't want to tag along?
I would rather adopt a child.
Copy that.
- Occultopuss?
- Yes.
But first Jules?
Sorry, no time for your tomfoolery and silliness.
That goes for your nonsense, malarkey, and shenanigans.
We need a favor, it's legit, and we promise to owe you big.
Make it quick.
I didn't have anything else sanitary.
I used to have one of these with wonder woman's face on it.
- Me too.
- It's a hair.
- We need to know where it came from.
- More specifically, whether it came from a wolf or a were-hybrid.
- Were-hybrid.
- Please, this could be a matter of life and death.
Or mange.
Sweet!
Use the bat phone.
Book of shadows.
Hey there.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
My associate Ron Davis, aka Bob Adams.
Known to his coven simply as rich fingerlind.
You're a warlock?
No, but Halle Berry calls me "Black Magic".
- You're never met her.
- Yes, I have.
On the set of Gothika.
That's right, I always forget.
He directed Gothika.
- May I help you?
- That depends.
Are you Willow Gimbley?
- I am.
- Great.
We just spent the evening with Stewart at our psychic detective agency.
And it turns out that he might be a lycan.
Not the drupe fruit.
Rather, the hairy biped that hunts and mauls.
I was afraid that could be the case.
Ever since he was bitten, he's been acting peculiar and blacking out.
All signs point directly to the mark of the beast.
Did you just say "bitten"?
We were on a mystical march in the Dick Smith Wilderness in Santa Ynez a few weeks ago.
We got lost, and he went off-trail to make water in the darkness - That's when it happened.
- Sure hope he finished his business.
He said he saw teeth, fur, and a snout.
Not necessarily in that order.
He's been so elusive this past week.
He won't let me or any other of the shamans in our rhombus help him because he doesn't want to put us in danger.
It's really starting to sink in.
My big bro.
Any idea where he might be now?
We're fearless, we're trying to help, and one of us is single.
And clearly goth-curious.
Trust us, you don't want the cops to find him before we do.
I suspect he's hiding and scared to death, what with the third and final full moon.
Which isn't exactly full, just especially gibbous.
His need to feed tonight will be more intense than anything you can possibly imagine.
I see.
Who are those people, and why?
Friends, and a couple of the others from Stewart's therapy group.
They're very close.
Stew's birthday last year.
- Is that shangri-lala's?
- Stew knows someone who works there.
We got half off the party package, we got to bring our own vampire geisha.
Now, that's a party.
Please call us if Stewart shows up.
Our number's on the back, in pencil.
But feel free to use my work cell on the front.
Please find my brother before he eats an innocent.
"Bitten"?
If she's telling the truth, the man was bitten by a beast.
This may be above our pay grade.
Don't be the third Thompson twin with the dreads.
This is exactly at our pay grade.
Plus, we're his only hope.
Imagine being him right now?
Then you wouldn't be able to get jiggy with his sister.
Don't you talk about her like that.
She's clearly in emotional peril, and her heart is heavy.
And all that weird, sexy makeup is just a cry for help from a strong man with a solid job.
Look at you crushing on Vampira.
Who is this?
I need you to come to leadbetter beach and bring me a 36-hour survival basket.
Look, dad, I'm a little tied up right now.
This is a challenge that involves a former nemesis and something I deserve.
Do you understand?
- Not even sort of.
- Bring me two ham sandwiches on stone ground wheat Mustard, no mayo.
Plenty of electrolyte liquids, and a flashlight.
- Asap.
- Okay, folks, here we go.
Keep your hands on this brand new beautiful truck and see how long you can last.
Last man standing drives it home.
No mercy, Spencer.
Hot off the wire, another possible animal attack.
About 6 miles from where that poor lamb was ripped apart two nights ago.
- Hunters?
- Must've been lousy shots.
Son of a bitch.
- What is it?
- My worst nightmare.
Spencer's gonna be calling me any second.
Let's go.
Right behind you.
I'm just gonna stop off at the ladies' room first.
Unbelievable.
- This is getting serious.
- Dude, - he completely forgot about his bag.
- What are you doing?
Preparing to playhot cross bunson the recorder.
What it look like.
You can't go rifling through another man's stuff.
Sure the privacy barrier was broken when you duct-taped his thighs together.
It helped restrict the flexibility in his hips.
"One capsule before bedtime".
What is Haloperidol prescribed for?
Schizophrenia.
It also reduces aggression towards others.
And used with chlorpromazine, can control hiccups.
- What do you know about Dr. Ken Tucker?
- Psychiatrist.
He's not on my route.
But he's doing well for himself.
He moved his practice into new digs on Arthur avenue.
No kidding.
This is the first time we've had a case with a doctor - who wasn't on your route.
- All streaks are made to be broken.
If this guy thinks stew needs help controlling his aggression, we should probably pay him a visit.
You weren't kidding.
This guy's feeling good about himself, huh?
His office is this way, Shawn.
Look at that.
Right on the door there.
Hello there, Myrtle.
My name is R.P. McMurphy.
This is my partner Cheswicke.
We both have some faulty wiring up in our noggins, and we're gonna have to talk to the doc.
No can do, sailor.
Push on!
- She totally shot me down.
- I got it.
Myrtle, when is Dr. Tucker's next available session?
April 25, 2011.
Now hit the bricks, Woodpecker.
Is there a standby option for extra-crazy people who very well may pose a threat to others?
You have ten seconds to make like my third husband and disappear.
I don't think we can hang with this old bird.
Heavens to Betsy!
I'll be right there.
- Don't touch me!
- Polexia, calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down.
Myrtle, give me some help here.
Oh, dear.
What are you doing, Shawn?
Get from behind that desk.
- That woman is gonna kill you.
- Patient info.
- Your phone.
I'll take a few pictures.
- Use your own phone.
- I left it in the car.
- Too bad for you.
- Just gimme your phone!
- She's gonna break it.
- Gimme the phone one time!
- Hurry up.
Dude, am I seeing what my brain is telling my eyes that they're seeing?
That's me and Ruiz the koala.
I make a yearly donation to the "bear with me" foundation to help protect the lives of these precious and unique creatures.
- You're cuddling the animal?
- We're nuzzling.
And Ruiz made the first move.
She comes.
Oh, this is so embarrassing.
Those boys are dumb as rain.
See you next week.
Actually, you won't.
I have to go.
I'm late for work.
Don't do anything you might regret, girly.
Remember why you came to us in the first place.
Excuse us.
Would it be possible for us to speak with the doctor in a non-therapy capacity?
You know, like gentlemen.
Beat it.
- That was a disaster.
- I wouldn't go that far.
So if I was to nuzzle with a non-domesticated zoo dweller, - I think I'd go with a giraffe.
- Giraffes are chronic spitters.
I'd climb up and risk it.
They've got those giant doughnut lips.
Like two Christmas hams kissing under mistletoe.
Did that smokin' hot mess look familiar to you?
No, I would have remembered that.
All right.
Fine.
I deserve this one.
Let's hear it.
For who?
The boy?
That's on Gus' iPod.
- It's back at the office.
- Who?
Don't say a word about Denise Williams.
Who?
There was another animal attack last night.
And it wasn't a poor little lamb.
Seems your delusional little buddy's upgraded to hunters.
Look who's suddenly on the black and tan express.
No, I don't think we're chasing a werewolf, Spencer.
Just another cuckoo who's seen too many movies.
Update: we don't have any actual proof that Stewart He pretty much confessed to both of us, and he has no alibi, remember?
Good luck getting by Dr. Tucker's pit bull of a receptionist.
Maybe you just didn't have the right tools.
The monocle isn't gonna help you in this situation.
I'm talking about one of these.
Idiot.
- Anything back yet on the follicle?
- No, but keep your phones on, and proceed with caution.
This is our case now too.
Maybe we should let them take it from here.
If we turn away every werewolf case that comes through our doors, people are gonna start talking.
Besides, do you really think Stew is sprouting hair and fangs, unable to resist some sort of blood lust when the moon is full?
If he isn't, then he's some crazy dude who thinks he is.
But what difference if he's out there killing people and precious wooly animals?
None, I guess.
I have to go.
I'm late for work.
Hold on.
- What is it?
- Check out those pictures.
Dude, I knew I'd seen that chick before!
She's a bartender at shangri-lala's.
Tell me I'm right.
Am I right?
She sure is.
Her name is Polexia.
Wasn't that Anna Paquin's name in Almost Famous?
Anna Paquin was in Almost Famous?
Let's get a drink.
I'm gonna need to speak with Dr. Ken tucker immediately.
Well, if it ain't little dorothy and her pal scarecrow.
Where's the tin man and the cowardly lion?
Well, here's the tin man And here's toto.
Follow me.
Obviously this is very troubling.
Does this look like the sort of thing gimbley's capable of, in your professional opinion?
Stewart has a very active imagination.
- That's not what I asked.
- I heard what you asked.
What would you have me say?
I took an oath.
My job is to help people like stewart to overcome the psychological hurdles that impair their desire to lead what we consider to be normal, everyday lives.
Take a look around.
My success rate in this area speaks for itself.
Wouldn't you agree?
We're just trying to figure out what we're dealing with here.
Two men are dead, and tonight's another full moon.
I can't believe I just said that.
My opinion is that you're dealing with a very troubled young man.
No kidding.
A few weeks ago, stewart took a turn for the worse.
It is possible he is blurring the lines between reality and a much darker fantasy.
At the end of our last session, he even became emotional and, uh gave me a hug.
- Why would he do that?
- In the event he never saw me again.
Yeah, do you have any idea where he might be?
I wish I knew.
Someone needs to save him from himself.
Hello, gentlemen.
What'll it be?
Well, he would like a roy rogers.
That much we know for certain.
What?
You look really familiar to me.
Yeah, I've just got one of those faces, I guess.
Nope, I don't I don't think so.
I'm almost positive I've seen you before.
Wait a second.
Are you a patient of Dr. Ken tucker?
I knew it!
I totally knew it.
We were just there earlier today.
I'm trying to get my buddy here an appointment.
He's absolutely stir crazy.
Yeah, and skip here has romantic dreams about firemen who look like dolph lundgren.
What?
You cheeky screwball.
What'd I tell you, he's wacko.
It was late, you were in a firehouse, and you slid down this large pole - Why?
- You started it.
Okay, fine.
Have you enjoyed your experience with Dr. Tucker?
He comes highly recommended by a fellow named stewart gimbley.
Stewart gimbley.
Yeah, I know that little weirdo.
I dialed him up with a great deal on our birthday package last year.
God, what a freak.
You know, he told me once that his father is some sort of demon rabbi.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
But as far as the doc goes, I mean, if we really wanted an appointment Look, I'm probably not the best person to ask about Dr. Tucker.
And why is that?
'Cause I don't think i'll be seeing him anymore.
I'm not sure anyone will, actually.
Capiche?
No, I not really.
No.
Could you elaborate?
I shouldn't say anything else.
Look, there are plenty of shrinks in this town.
Trust me.
Did you decide on something to drink or what?
Yes, I have.
I'd like a sloe gin fizz, please.
Hold the gin, extra fizz.
I'll have more cherries.
Help me.
Please.
Help me.
Okay, this is really, really - Really not good.
- Of course it's not.
I woke up next to a pair of dead hunters who were torn to shreds.
I'm sorry, I can't focus until we handle this wardrobe issue.
Agreed.
You know what, you can use my halloween costume from last year, which is in storage here.
- Really?
- There's a banker's box with a hand-drawn jack-o-lantern on it.
Costume's inside.
We need to call lassiter and juliet and make a citizen's arrest now, while he's docile.
Since when do we make citizen's arrests?
Since a guy showed up naked, covering his junk with balloons, saying he woke up smack next to the victims.
- Something feels off.
- What feels off?
I don't know yet.
That was impossibly fast.
You even put on the glasses.
- Who am I supposed to be?
- Are you kidding?
- You didn't watch television as a kid?
- Not after poltergeist.
You are none other than dwayne cleophus wayne ofa different world.
A ladies' man with a plan.
What?
Stew, you know you've put us in a tough spot coming back here.
I know.
I'll turn myself in.
I don't know what else I could have done.
I warned everyone.
I can't live like this.
I've never hurt anybody my whole life.
Stew, look at yourself, man.
I mean, you're you.
I can't believe you're doing these things.
I know, but there isn't a single shred of evidence to suggest that I'm not.
Can you think of anything you haven't told us?
Nothing can hurt your cause.
Willow disagrees, but I have long since suspected that our father, rabbi gimbley, is actually a dybbuk, and that we might be the spawn of demon seed.
Keeping in mind, of course, that not all demons are bad.
Take hellboy, for instance.
He's nice.
- Polexia wasn't kidding.
- Polexia?
What-you Talked with the black widow?
- You call her the "black widow"?
- Not just me.
All of us in the group.
She was married to a guy without hair - What's that called?
- Bald.
- Alopecia.
- That's the fear of beans.
So one day, polexia ties him up to the bed and gags him and all that, you know, she was into some very kinky business.
- Sure.
- Go on.
He had a heart attack and croaked.
But also, she used to totally dominate our sessions, like her problems are more important than ours.
But we put up with it because she has voluptuous buttocks.
What do you mean "used to dominate" your sessions?
Well, she once threatened dr.
Tucker during a neo-jungian sharing exercise, and ever since then, she only does one-on-ones with him.
Really?
We're taking you to your sister at occultopuss.
We are?
The man is wanted for a double homicide and first-degree lamb slaughter.
I know this.
You think I don't know this?
Look, I'm taking a huge leap of faith here, okay?
You are to stay put at occultopus until you hear from us Do you understand?
I can't put willow in harm's way it's unbrotherly.
Listen, I don't think you're gonna turn into a giant dog head tonight, okay?
I'm getting serious vibes that you are part of someone else's nefarious plan.
- Why?
- You're vulnerable.
And you look like that.
And you believe in weird things.
Willow locks you in the bathroom, just to be safe.
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
It all ends nice.
- You really think so?
- I do.
You're still a weird little dude, you'll probably be single for some time.
But I think we can keep you out of jail.
Deal?
- Deal.
- My man.
- Be careful.
- Don't worry, I got it.
You drop that cooler in your backseat off at the beach to my dad, then we lay low until dr.
Tucker's office closes.
- Then what?
- We finesse our way in.
We find some evidence that stew's not a hairy monster, and that it's actually polexia that's behind all this nefariousness.
It's wolf hair.
Authentic wolf hair.
And we spoke to Dr. Ken tucker.
He said stewart is a very troubled young man.
No problem.
I hope you're right about this.
- Who was that?
- It was a wrong number.
Two hours till sundown.
Only ten of you left.
Who's gonna win this baby?
Shawn, where have you been?
Gus and I are working on a case, the likes of which we've never seen.
That's every week.
What's truly extraordinary is this test of endurance.
Both mind and body have to be very strong.
Very strong.
Here you go, dad.
It's everything you asked for.
Plus a couple extras Daddy got a care package.
- You're wasting your breath, Zielinski.
- Must be your boy.
Keep an eye on your chakras, everybody.
He's a 5'10" psychic detective, which is more than I can say for that mean-spirited daughter of yours.
- My height?
- She's an uncompromising chef.
She makes sandwiches at sub-zero, and she refuses to hear me when I say "no mayo".
That's my girl.
Dad, am I sensing a bitter history between you and sam elliott's younger brother harland?
He's my old nemesis.
Butch Zielinski.
I told you all about him.
He used to step on my toes, steal my thunder.
- You could take him.
- Thank you, guster.
Agreed.
Now, the guy we're working for thinks he's a werewolf.
- Whip garlic at him.
That's all I got.
- That's for vampires.
Look, I simply cannot afford any distractions.
Today is all about me, me, me And that hemi v-8, which, i'll have you know, churns out an astonishing Can't you smell it?
I drive an echo.
All right Here's a few freebies.
Casey kasem here with the manicure, clearly not a truck guy.
You know he's early-exit fodder.
Woman by the side mirror is a germaphobe.
Sneeze in her direction, she's out of here.
And the young buck staring across the bed at mounds mcclintock there would like nothing more than to take his hands off the hard body, and put it on the soft one.
I'll be damned.
I didn't clock the germaphobe.
You're welcome.
High five.
Just kidding.
Focus.
Go get 'em, pop.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
You took a picture of his schedule.
There's nothing impressive about knowing when he's exiting the building.
Wait for it - Let's do this.
- Do what?
We still don't have a plan yet.
Would you stop being a baby?
We just have to stash ourselves until Myrtle leaves.
What's wrong with the men's bathroom?
We're men.
How's that not obvious?
Myrtle is a woman.
If she has to use the bathroom, she's coming in here.
Think you're ready for this night train, Johnny Murdock?
Think again.
You wish you were Johnny Murdock.
Shut up, Shawn!
Never underestimate the swiss!
I was underestimating you, Shawn.
What are we looking for, exactly?
Polexia's file.
And any snacks you can find.
Let's just pretend that didn't happen.
For the record, I'm only doing this because Stewart might be innocent.
Might.
That and you want to have a half-black Fairuza Balk baby with his sister.
Question is, whatever will you name it?
Well, if it's a girl, Lavender, of course.
If it's a boy, Deandre Pride Guster.
- Dude.
- What?
- Polexia's file is gone.
- What do you mean "gone"?
There's a tab that says "Polexia Li", but the file is gone.
That's a major bummer.
Gimme the swiss.
See if you can find Stew's file.
Okay, here we go.
Here it is.
Let's see "I fear that Stewart's condition is worsening.
"He's completely ravaged by delusions and uncontrollable homicidal impulses".
I don't think she was wearing underwear.
"He may pose a grave danger to himself and others.
"I'm afraid there's only one recourse.
"He must be committed to a psychiatric facility".
Shawn, are you hearing this?
Dr. Tucker wrote this at Stewart's last session.
- We have to go.
Willow's in danger.
- Wait.
What?
Do these look right to you?
- The label says Haloperidol, but - I knew it!
Only for the last 11 seconds, but still - What's actually in the bottle?
- I don't know.
- Horse tranquilizers, maybe.
- Horse tranquilizers?
- What do you know about taxidermy?
- What don't I know about it?
I'm a part of the largest campaign to abolish the practice completely.
- That owl cost five grand?
- No way.
- What about the beaver?
- No beaver is worth that much.
It would take a larger game.
A moose head, or possibly a cougar.
Or a gray wolf.
- It's neither Stewart nor Polexia.
- Exactly.
We gotta get back to Occultopuss.
Black Magic.
Is everything okay?
Please tell us Stew is still here.
Okay, I know that you said to wait for you guys to get back, but Dr. Ken Tucker came by, and he was very grim.
He said that Stewart might try to harm himself, and/or me, and that he was the only one who can help him.
You let Dr. Ken Tucker take your brother?
Sorry.
Dr. Tucker has been looking after Stew for over a year.
- I just met you guys today!
- What does this mean, Shawn?
It means somebody's about to die.
Personal address I know.
I said I've got it.
Well, find it.
What the hell is going on here?
Sweet.
Juliet, write that down.
This woman, Polexia Li, is tonight's unlucky victim.
I know her.
Wasn't that Anna Paquin's name in Almost Famous?
She was in Almost Famous?
'Cause I don't think I'll be seeing him anymore.
I'm not sure anyone will, actually.
Capiche?
Yes!
And she was having an affair with Dr. Ken Tucker.
Not Anna Paquin, Polexia.
She was his patient.
He tried to end it, she went ballistic.
She's gonna spill the beans and cost him his marriage.
And more importantly, his thriving practice, and he can't have that.
Worst of all, he's methodically set up Stewart to take the fall.
- How?
- It'll sound ridiculous.
It makes more sense to catch him, and then let me do my thing.
- Where is she now?
- You wrote down where she lives.
She tends bar at Shangri-Lala's.
A 15-block radius.
She could be at either place or anywhere in between because the buses stopped running an hour ago, so I'm getting a vibe that she walks from work.
Fine, you two hit Shangri-Lala's, and we'll take care of the rest.
- I'm coming too.
- I'm riding shotgun!
We are down to two.
It is down to Butch and Henry, mano a mano.
Excuse me.
Where's Polexia?
She felt sick, I let her go.
Strike two, then.
She's definitely not here.
Yes, I have the right address.
It's the one you divined!
Hello, is someone there?
Hey, I have mace!
You just about gave me a heart attack, you son of a bitch!
What are you doing here?
I wanted to apologize for being so insensitive.
It's too late for that.
No, it's not too late.
We can work it out.
I love my wife, but I really do enjoy having sex with you.
That's the best you've got?
Pretty soon, everyone will know just how pathetic you really are.
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
It didn't have to end this way.
Freeze!
SBPD.
Hands in the air!
You don't understand.
She's very sick, I was trying to help.
I don't think so.
And woman to woman, it's time to ixnay this shortcut.
Way to be, partner!
Put your hands behind your back.
Check up there.
Great work from the whole team!
He's bound to have Stew stashed up there somewhere.
I haven't seen Stewart in over a week.
I've got Stew!
That was impossibly fast.
What the hell kind of sick charade were you planning out here?
You see He couldn't just kill Polexia in cold blood.
She was bound to have told someone.
He needed a patsy, and in walks Stew.
Over the edge and convinced he'd been bitten by a werewolf.
Evil black light bulb goes off.
First, Dr. Ken Tucker gave Stew the wrong drugs to ensure that he'd be passed out.
The next night, he waltzed into our office, where we slept under what we thought was the blanket of protection - a double-bolt lock provides.
- You never lock the door.
He smashed our window, stole Stew, and killed two grizzled hunters with an injection of something I presume is untraceable.
Then he actually proceed to wolf them up, using the tastelessly mummified claws of the beastly pelt that I now wear on my head as a tribute to its power and grace.
It's an awful act Taxidermy!
And, of course, the murder thing too.
And finally, he branded Stew with a pentagram, and left him unconscious.
All leading to tonight, when he would kill Polexia and let poor Stewart confess.
For what it's worth, I went into the woods to kill a deer.
The hunters were a mere crime of opportunity.
A happy accident.
That's worth absolutely nothing.
You're the sickest of us all.
Well, Spencer, I guess I should have listened to you.
- No one else would have either, so - You're gonna pay for our window?
Yeah, right.
That's rich.
Gus gave them to me.
Just in case.
Of course he did.
- Good thinking.
- You can never be too safe.
Where am I?
I feel like a baby.
That's because you're wearing a diaper.
But you're gonna be okay, big bro.
Thanks to these guys.
How can we possibly repay you?
Maybe you and Black Magic here could get together and do some cauldron stirring sometime.
I'd love to.
Sounds good.
I think we should celebrate.
As soon as I am not naked anymore.
Agreed.
You're ruthless, Henry.
You are strong of mind, but mean of heart.
We reap what we sow, Zielinski.
Time to pay the piper.
My plight is noble, Henry.
This vehicle's not for me, but for the children of St. Thomas of the Apostles Orphanage of Goleta.
Come on.
Where did Look.
It's like Pippi Longstocking's little sister, Patches Longstocking.
You don't look much like the orphan type.
As an infant, after I was abandoned and left lakeside, only to be found by big-fly fishermen, it was the fine sisters of St. Thomas of the Apostles that raised the man you see before you today.
And when that old station wagon caught fire and the kids didn't have new wheels to take 'em on their field trips, I said, "Butch "You know what you gotta do".
So here I am.
It's bigger than us, Henry.
And don't worry, I'm gonna have this thing fitted with a custom camper so the kids can't fall off the back onto the freeway at high speeds.
Are you okay?
You gave up your dream machine to a guy you punched in a bowling alley.
He brought a nun!
Sometimes you gotta give one up for the team.
You have to admit, those were some cute kids.
No doubt.
You know what, that's actually a really nice thing you just did.
- You ought to be proud of yourself.
- I'm tired.
I want waffles.
- I could eat some waffles.
- I'm buying.
Which means I'm buying.
You know that's right.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
I'm sorry, dad.
But since when did bandanas count as hats?
- I was close.
- Close doesn't cut it anymore.
You're going soft on me.
You know I'm 11, right?
It's not some bar trick, Shawn.
This is about survival.
Knowing how many hats in the room may very well save your life one day.
Now pay attention.
Today we're learning about worst-case scenarios.
We got down here as soon as we could.
Are you all right?
You had better have a good reason for dragging me out of my bed and down here to "Nowheresville" at 4:30 in the morning.
Where the hell's Spencer?
Your guess is as good as mine.
If I wanted to make guesses, I would go on a game show.
What is going on?
Look, all I know is he left me this message about an hour ago.
Buddy, I figured it out.
It's sweet.
This whole thing was just a rehearsal.
I'm leaving my place.
Meet me down at the storage yard now.
Come in your fireman PJ's if you have to.
Just be there.
What does that mean, "rehearsal"?
I have no idea.
What are you doing here?
Here we go.
How do you escape when you're locked in the trunk of a car?
"When"?
Don't you mean "if", as, like, maybe never.
Not today, kid.
Your survival training starts right now.
Don't worry, Ms. Nussbaum.
It's fine.
Got the keys right here.
Just teaching Shawn a little survival technique.
Thank you.
All right, Shawn.
Listen up.
Now here's what you want to do.
You want to feel for the brake light.
You feel it?
It's right over here.
Okay, now what you would do is you'd kick it out with your feet.
You'd want to create a hole to look out and see where you are.
I didn't say to actually do it.
I said you would do it.
Two, two Three, four.
Gina, who is it?
- It's Shawn Spencer.
- Who's Shawn Spencer?
It's this guy that I went on maybe two dates with, like, three years ago.
- Pick it up.
- No, it's weird 'cos we had a great time, I don't know.
He never called me back, it's awkward.
Play hard to get.
Watch this.
Shawn Spencer, what do you want?
Gina Repach.
Hello.
That's all you have to say for yourself "hello"?
Why did you never call me back?
Was it because I had two slices of cheesecake at the cheesecake factory?
'cause if that's it, I have lost a lot of weight since then.
I really have.
And I feel so bad about that.
And I want to address it, I do, but you could do me a little favor here.
See, I'm in some trouble, and I need A favor?
How dare you ask me for a favor after what you did to me?
I'm sorry, but nobody, nobody treats Gina Repach that way, FYI.
Wait, don't It wasn't the cheesecake.
It was the talking about yourself in the third person.
Come on, come on.
All right.
Wait.
This just came in from Shawn.
Read it.
I have no idea what this means.
"Trunk yelrfx ocone pol peac sig".
What is that?
It's gibberish.
Wait, there's more.
"Binshot not lol".
- What is he talking about?
- Binshot.
What are you playing with over there?
It's blood.
Binshot.
Oh, my God.
Shawn's been shot.
Psych 409 "Shawn Takes a Shot in the Dark" Timing: Psych Team Based on the blood patterns and marks on the ground, he was shot here and dragged this way.
Blood trail ends here.
Couldn't get any useable tread marks, but these swirls in the gravel indicate kickback from a car pulling out of here at a high rate of speed.
Recovered a single shell casing.
Shooter used a. 45 auto.
Who the hell called him down here?
I did.
- It's his father.
- Which is why I don't want him here.
If Shawn really is shot, they'll be no room for family in the investigation.
If Shawn has been shot, there's no room I'm not gonna bust open to find my son.
- You got it?
- Henry, please.
This thing may get personal.
We might need him.
If we do this, we do this my way.
No questions.
Spencer will ride with me.
We'll chase the breadcrumbs to find him.
You take Gus to retrace Shawn's steps in whatever ridiculous investigation he got himself into.
We got a lot of ground to cover.
Let's go.
Move out!
Think hard.
What brought Shawn down here?
All I know is this whole thing started a few days ago, with the ice cream truck on the highway.
Easy there, grubbs.
Keep those oversized mitts off the car.
This is a brand-new issued vehicle.
I just picked it up.
It is cherry, and it's gonna stay that way.
It's almost too sweet to drive.
- Smells like new car plus lemons.
- Yeah, it does.
- Leather?
- Pleather.
Closest thing to it, though.
Hit me.
What do we got going here?
An accident.
The driver was taken to the hospital.
He's in stable condition but unconscious.
So what am I doing here?
Well, sir, nobody is sure how the accident happened.
The key word in that sentence is "accident".
What are we supposed to do, go to the hospital and wait bedside while the ice cream man comes to?
Call me when somebody gets shot or there's a dead body.
That's it.
That's the winner.
Get a 5x7 of that and a couple of wallet sizes for my buddy here.
- What are they doing here?
- Maybe Vick called them in.
We are not here to hone in on your case.
We just heard "ice cream" on our police radio, and it happened to be Gus's snack time.
Look, fellas.
Tell you what.
You're welcome to it.
Have at it!
Go for it.
Who knows?
Maybe you'll solve the great ice cream crime caper of the century.
Crime of the century.
Still 91 years to solve that one.
Gus and I are gonna pace ourselves.
We accept.
You know we still have to file the paperwork on the accident, right?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Hell of a lot of strawberry shortcake bars, destroyed.
Before they even had a chance, buddy.
Shawn sensed someone might've tampered with the truck before the accident.
Anyone tried tracking Shawn's phone?
His GPS must not be working.
They can't get anything.
"Ocone yelrfx sig " How does he expect us to find him with this cat scratch?
We can do this.
It's a text.
They're abbreviations.
That's like that.
You're out of the loop on what the young people are doing now.
"The young people"?
Yeah, fact check.
I'm a little younger than you.
You're sure?
You're kidding, right?
With all due respect, Spencer, I know that you were a good cop.
But I'm still on the force, and maybe I'm a little more viable at this point.
We'll see.
You hear them out loud, you could trigger some stuff.
"Ocone".
Cone.
Maybe the "o" is on its own.
Maybe it could be it's own word.
O outreach, outhouse cone.
Oval cone, orange cone, or Orange cone.
Construction.
Could this be pertaining to some sort of construction?
"Yelrfx".
Yellow reflector.
"Peac sig, peac sig".
What the hell is a peac sig?
I'm not sure.
But I do know a stretch of road on the 166 that's been under construction for more than a month.
It's worth a shot.
So Shawn has a psychic hunch about this ice cream truck.
Where does that lead you?
So we found out who was servicing those trucks and decided to pay them a visit the next day.
Fire in the hole, huh?
- Hey, there.
- Can I help you?
I sure hope so.
I assume you're one of the mechanics that works here at the shop.
I just started.
- Who are you?
- My name is Shawn Spencer.
This is my associate Donut Holestein.
- Garth Longmore.
- "Garth Longmore"?
I feel bad.
I should've come up with something better for you.
What do you want?
That's a fair question.
Deserves an answer.
Donut, you got anything?
Mr. Longmore, with a name like Longmore, have you given any thought to getting involved in the adult pictures?
- What?
- Sorry.
Do you know any reason why a truck may have welding marks underneath it?
Without seeing the truck for myself, I wouldn't know for sure.
But Welding's usually used to repair a crack or reinforce steel that's been compromised in some way.
You guys looking for some repairs or you need a truck or what?
I, sir, am starting a new business.
I'm going to need to create a vehicle that combines a standard Wienermobile with a Zamboni.
Can these two things be welded together into one?
The simple mission statement for my venture is to create the perfect juicy Wiener and the perfect icy surface to enjoy said Wiener on.
Now, to be completely frank with you No pun intended The majority of my investors have yet to see the brilliance of this business plan.
Thank you for your time.
You know what?
Hold onto that thought, and I'm gonna I'm gonna grab one of these pamphlets here.
And I'm gonna call you, Garth Longmore, when I'm ready to build my first prototype.
Okay, so Shawn figured out what exactly from this venture?
He was convinced that the truck had been tampered with, he was going to need a different tactic if he was gonna get any real answers.
Or Maybe just one of these.
Let's go see this Garth Longmore.
Okay, listen up.
I am detective Juliet O'Hara.
I am looking for a garth Longmore.
Anyone want to step up?
Longmore quit just yesterday.
He ain't here.
He quit?
He just started.
Hell of a mechanic on top of it.
Did he give a reason for quitting?
Judging by the car he pulled away in, maybe he won the lottery.
- What kind of car was he driving?
- '70 yellow roadrunner.
Is this supposed to be a nice car?
What?
Don't look at me.
I drive an echo.
Son, are you wearing children's pajamas?
Can we move on, please?
Did he leave a forwarding address or anything?
But if you find him, let me know, because he walked off with my mig gun.
He had a gun?
It's not a gun.
It's a mig gun.
It's used for welding.
All right, thank you.
What do you do when an assailant is chasing you?
Do we have to do this?
You really don't like me, do you?
One day you'll thank me.
Once you get some distance, change your course.
Never run in a straight line!
Straight line is the shortest distance between two people.
Zigzag!
That's right!
That's right!
Thatta boy!
Throw them off their course!
This is the area.
There's construction for the next 6 miles.
There's our "peac sig".
It's a peace sign.
That's what Shawn saw.
Wait.
Yellow reflector.
Orange cone.
- Stop the car right here.
Just stop it!
- Why?
God, I love new brakes.
All right, what are we looking at?
This was from the car Shawn was in.
There's accidents up and down this highway This is Shawn.
How can you be so sure?
Because I'm the one who taught him how to do it.
This is all I have on Longmore.
- Does he have a record?
- Only record he has is of being dead.
- What do you mean?
- Garth Longmore died in 1956.
Criminals do this all the time.
They buy the social security numbers off the deceased on the black market.
Clearly he didn't want anyone to know who he was or what he wanted.
Do you have any idea what you've stumbled onto?
What have you got for me?
So we don't know the guy's name, but he's definitely our bad guy.
- Any leads?
- All we got is that he was last seen driving off in a vintage 1970 Plymouth Road Runner, yellow with black racing stripes.
Have you seen it?
We may have seen part of it.
Yellow reflector is the last clue, which means he must've escaped somewhere around here.
He's close.
O'Hara, listen.
Tell McNab to come pick up my car.
It's off 166 just past mile marker 8.
If he touches anything other than the door and 10 and 2 on the wheel, I'll personally visit his nightmares for all of eternity.
- Copy?
- Copy that.
Because Spencer and I are going it on foot.
Let's go find my son.
Anybody in there?
Could use some help out here.
Open up if you're in there!
I've been shot.
And I'm being chased.
Could you call the Santa Barbara Police Department and ask for detective Carlton Lassiter?
I'm sorry I'm getting blood No, slow down.
We should hurry, he's really motivated.
I got a phone.
- Tell me again who you need me to call.
- Detective Carlton Lassiter.
You really are incompetent, aren't you?
Aren't you?
!
You couldn't do one simple thing.
It's the same as it was in the joint.
He surprised me, all right?
I had no choice.
But then you couldn't just get him here.
How the hell do you escape from the trunk of a car?
In his defense, I think I'm the only kid whose father taught him how to kick out a taillight from the back of a trunk.
Shut your face.
What if I didn't make it back here in time after having to go pick up your car you just left on the road?
Idiot!
- Did you at least get the truck set?
- It's ready.
Give me some credit.
We're this close to the money, and you're screwing it up.
We don't need this distraction.
Not now.
I say we just shoot him in the head and dump the body and get on with this.
Guys, if I could interject briefly here And this is me speaking from my own experience That feels a little rash.
You're both under a great deal of stress, and I don't think now is the time to make important life decisions.
I'll tell you what works for me, and maybe it's it's just me.
Draw a hot bath.
It doesn't matter who goes first.
You got a smart mouth, huh?
Look, I got it under control.
You want me to shoot him right now?
I will.
- I'll take him out - Not to be a stickler, but you did shoot me once.
Are you listening to me?
I'm having a hard time concentrating on anything but the gun.
Could be my A.D.D. acting up.
I want you to imagine a bullet coming from that gun penetrating your skin and lodging in your brain.
You know how easy that would be for me?
Physically, yes.
But I would imagine that it would give you some pause emotionally.
You don't know how lucky you are.
My idiot partner here screwed up big-time.
But that's par for the course.
Now I pull this thing off, and we're out of here.
But if Einstein here screws up again, you're gonna be my ticket.
Now I got a hostage in my back pocket just in case, but know this One stupid move, and I got more than enough plastic bags for your body parts.
Got it?
I got it.
Note to self: call Hefty with commercial idea.
Thanks for duct-taping my bullet hole with a chamois.
Maybe if you could mail me to my dad's house now.
That'd be awesome.
What do I call you?
Mr. Blonde?
Mr. Pink?
Shut it!
God, what is your problem?
You know, I I've heard people say that with gunshot wounds, it's really all about the shock, you know?
That at some point, you know, the bullet wound itself just goes numb.
You can't feel anything.
Well, it's not true.
I can say, without a doubt, that this is the most pain I've ever been in.
So if you wouldn't mind turning the other direction, I would very much like to weep, - if that's okay.
- It's a flesh wound.
All right?
You're fine.
Stop whining.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Man, it is the darnedest thing.
The Yelp application on my iPhone here told me that there should be a Starbucks, right where we're standing.
And unless you can make caramel macchiatos with that with that pistol, then Yelp is dead wrong.
- Stay where you are.
- Easy, man.
Wait a minute.
I know you.
You're Garth Longmore, though I'm beginning to suspect that's not your real name, is it?
By the looks of you, I'd say it's probably something preppy.
Am I right?
Maybe Ryan or Geoffrey with a "G".
I will shoot you.
Just relax.
It's creepy enough without the whole gun-and-flashlight routine, don't you think?
We can talk.
We're just We're just two guys talking.
We're rational men speaking.
I know what's going on here, and I get it.
And it's an ingenious plan, to be honest.
Of course, if it was me I'd just be happy stealing the ice cream.
So what was it like over there?
The jungle?
- What are you talking about?
- Combat.
Must've been hell.
How did you know?
I'm a psychic.
That's what I do.
I think between the gunshot and the head bashing, my visions are coming in kind of crazy, but I can see them.
They're clear.
They're sharp.
I see you.
Were you like, special forces or a sniper?
I was.
LRRP.
LRRP?
Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol.
It was a long time ago, though.
My skills have no time clock.
So you could probably take a target from what?
If the wind conditions are right.
That's impressive.
Some people get pretty good at that stuff.
It does beg the question, why didn't you kill me from three feet?
We both know you could've, but you didn't.
I suspect it's because you're not really a killer, are you?
At least not anymore.
I think it's time for you to stop talking.
No more talking.
Think you can pick up the pace, Mr. Viability?
There's an excellent chance I was bitten by a tick back there.
I could be going through the stages of Lyme disease.
- Man up, detective.
- What is it?
Steroids, right?
You're juicing, aren't you?
I knew it.
He went this way.
So this is where Shawn is living.
Odd that it takes him being shot and dragged away in a trunk - for me to actually get an invitation.
- You didn't have an invitation.
True.
This is the old Mee Mee's Fluff n' Fold.
Shawn got a good deal.
- I hope so.
It was a dry cleaners.
- It's kind of his thing.
Last spring he stayed at the old Color Me Mine space.
All the saucers you see here, he made.
Besides, it has its advantages.
- What are you doing?
- I'm not wearing these pajamas anymore.
So you're stealing his clothes?
He's not dead.
I'm not stealing anything.
Holy crap.
Half these clothes are mine.
- This is my shirt.
- Let's split up and comb the place.
Shawn was here when he left you the message about the rehearsal, so there are clues as to what he was doing or looking at that made him call you and drive down to that stockyard in the middle of the night.
You see anything?
I mean no.
Did Abigail move in?
What?
- This is Shawn, remember?
- Right.
Has he been particularly aggressive about his hygiene, or has he been cross-dressing lately?
I think they've officially reached the "he has a drawer, she has a toothbrush" stage.
And how's that going?
Not too sure.
- I think I found something.
- What?
Shawn grabbed this from the auto shop.
It was sitting here next to the phone.
This is what he was looking at when he called!
Look at the bottom.
"Expert mechanics of all domestic and foreign vehicles.
Engine work, transmissions, exhaust systems " No, below that.
"Long-haul refrigeration, armored transport".
I still don't get the connection to the ice cream truck.
I think Shawn did.
I'm checking his history to see what his most recent web searches were.
mentalistspoilers.com, billyzane.
thumbnail/hair.com.
No, here we are.
"armoredcar/santabarbara/theft".
Armored car theft.
The ice cream truck was just the rehearsal.
I know you said not to talk, but I got to be frank with you.
It's always been an issue for me.
You should've seen my report cards in grade school.
I like to talk out loud when I'm working stuff out in my head.
That's what I do.
Just feel free to ignore me, okay?
This is a really elaborate plan you guys have going here.
I mean, you got the job as a mechanic just to have access to the truck, right?
That's smart.
Then instead of reinforcing the bottom, you actually weakened it, creating easy access to get to the money.
The question is, how are you gonna get to it while the truck was still moving, right?
Sorry, man.
Like I said, this is all me.
Just pretend like I'm not even here.
You tip it.
That's what you do.
You tip it over.
Once the car's tipped over, you just crowbar open the trapdoor and you make off with the dough.
All right, let's light it up!
Come on, Rick.
Let's go!
Let's go!
This time, it's not about ice cream.
You could still get one after, if you'd like.
But it's gonna be real, man The armored car, the money.
Question is, where is it gonna go down?
And when?
What do you care?
You'll be dead.
You let me do all the talking, got it?
Can I help you?
We're looking for a yellow Plymouth.
You seen it?
As a matter of fact, I have.
You don't forget a car like that.
Pulled in about ten minutes ago looking for gas.
Offered to fix his broken taillight for him, though.
My and my partner got a nice little mechanic business Did you happen to see who was driving?
I got a look at him.
A big, oafy-looking guy.
Not sure he had all his marbles.
He was kind of stupid, if you ask me.
I sent him up four miles to the next station.
Was this guy with him?
No, that guy wasn't with him.
Why, is that guy wanted or something?
- You could say that.
- All right Thank you for your time.
- About four miles - That was about ten minutes ago?
What was that all about?
I was gonna ask the questions.
Old habits.
Cut it out, all right?
I'm in charge of this investigation.
God, it's just like working with Shawn.
McNab, put out an APB on the Plymouth and alert all authorities to patrol the 166 off the Horse Creek exit.
You got more questions?
Come on, Chatty Cathy, we're wasting time.
Want me to carry you?
Because of your screwup, now we got the cops and what I figure must be this guy's old man snooping around.
What's the big deal, man?
They took off.
Because I was thinking on my feet!
I'm telling you.
If you can't take care of this, I'm gonna.
Kid should've been dead an hour ago.
Fine, fine, fine.
"Fine, fine, fine," you nimrod.
You gonna do it or not?
What do you want?
I did what I was supposed to do.
You idiot, you did not!
- Get in there and do it!
- I did!
Jesus, of all the people I could get linked up with Yeah, you want the money, you better step up.
Gina?
Look, I'm sorry I hung up on you.
It was immature, I know.
It's just my feelings were hurt, because I never heard back from you It's fine.
Get in there!
Look, it's really, really important that you call the p More important than my feelings?
- You are so self-centered!
- No, Gina, don't - What are you doing?
- It's not what you think.
- Give me that!
- I swear!
I wasn't calling the police or anything like that.
Look, man.
I know this doesn't end well for me, okay?
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and And I've made my peace with that.
But recently, I met a girl, somebody special, just like you did.
Just like me?
Yeah, I saw her in a vision.
She's beautiful.
She's got She's got red hair, right?
Most beautiful hair I've ever seen.
My girl's name's Abigail.
What's yours?
Maureen.
Maureen O'Hara.
No, better.
Look, I just want to call her and say good-bye.
That's it, no funny business.
You can watch me dial.
You can listen in.
If I say anything Anything that you don't like, you can shoot me.
Deal?
Count on it.
I will shoot you.
Thank you.
I found something!
There's a large transfer of money to be delivered, close to $500,000.
That's the schedule and route.
This call is to say good-bye.
- Shawn, are you okay?
- Try to get anything, a location.
Where are you?
Don't don't ask me any questions, 'cause I can't say anything else.
If you care about me, you'll understand.
I'm listening.
I'm not gonna be able to have much of a future anymore.
But if you look back at where we were, I'll be there, okay?
Back?
What are you talking about?
The wind chimes that I got you for your birthday, every time you hear them from now on, that'll be me.
First of all, you are going to be fine.
We are going to find you, okay?
Don't worry.
This is supposed to be a good-bye call.
Now tell her you love her, and let's go.
Listen, before before I go, I have to say one more thing.
Of course, Shawn.
What is it?
Say it.
I need you to know that I love you.
- I think that I - Good-bye, Abigail.
Hang it up now!
That's it!
That's it!
It's done!
How stupid letting him use a phone?
The cops are probably on their way!
- He was just calling his girlfriend!
- It's over!
I'm putting an end to this.
Lassiter, I just spoke to Shawn.
He's alive.
He was trying to give me clues about something.
I didn't understand.
None of it made sense.
What?
Juliet, wait.
Slow down.
Going back?
Wind chimes?
- No, that doesn't mean anything to me.
- Wait!
He's back at the gas station!
Come on!
Come on!
Can you make it back to the Mariposa exit off the 166?
There's a gas station two blocks up.
That's where the robbery'll take place.
I'll explain when we get there.
Let's go.
Where's Shawn?
All right, let's do this.
O'Hara, stay close.
You know the drill.
- Keys.
- I'm not covered for someone else.
I'm a police detective and a certified pursuit driver.
I think you'll be okay.
Keys.
Go, team!
- Gun it, Jules!
Give it all it's got!
- This is all it's got.
Is that my shirt?
Look at you, buddy!
You're like Vin Diesel!
That makes Jules Michelle Rodriguez and you Paul Walker!
- This is no good!
- Don't worry, you'll be all right.
I know, I'll be fine.
I just really don't want to be Paul Walker, not even for one day.
You could be Lucas Black from Tokyo Drift, but then we wouldn't be in the movie with you!
That's weird.
I'll just be Walker.
You ready, buddy?
I'm gonna jump on your hood.
You must be out of your damn mind!
It's a company car.
Jump on Lassiter's!
Move closer!
Do not jump on this vehicle!
This is a brand-new vehicle!
Look, man, I have been shot!
I am jumping on somebody's car!
- Stop the car!
- Got him!
Don't you dare stop this car, Lassie!
Hang on tight!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Great idea, dad!
I was thinking of not doing that.
Lay back!
Did he hit my car?
- Gun it, old man!
- Watch this!
- What the hell are you doing?
- Which Spencer are you talking to?
Doesn't matter!
You're the same!
Am not!
Dad, I have a clear shot.
Give me the gun.
Do it!
Drop it!
Drop it now!
Hands where I can see them!
Hands!
Come here.
Come here son.
That's it.
Nice shooting, detective.
Did you just call me "detective"?
Shouldn't we wait for Diesel and Rodriguez before you slap the cuffs on him?
You know, I I had to tell Juliet that I loved her.
- Was it awkward?
- Little bit.
Of course, at the time, I was more concerned about not getting shot again.
Guess you were just doing what you had to do.
The weird thing is I think she was about to say it back to me.
I bet she was just playing along, doing what she had to do.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Oh, look, that's weird.
It's for you.
Who's that?
Just say hello.
Gina who?
Will you stop yelling in my ear?
I don't even know you.
Dude, tell her we're going for cheesecake.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
In a battle drill All right, Shawn, that's it.
Come on, up and at 'em.
It's noon.
Half the day is gone.
Mean firepower.
Look at this, these guys right here.
What they're doing?
Jumping out of helicopters.
Look at that guy, he's rappelling down a mountainside.
Look at everything they're getting done while you're laying here slacking off.
What does that make you want to do when you grow up?
Join the Army.
Go into advertising.
It's a really catchy jingle.
Seriously, I can't get it out of my head.
Let me get this straight.
Hotel manager says she found a body this morning, but you're saying John Doe offed himself When I said I wanted to see you, this is not that I had in mind.
I thought you said spending time together was more important than what we were doing.
Let me just solve this quickly, and we can go.
I do not believe this man committed suicide.
Unfortunately, he was murdered.
- Wait, already?
Are you sure?
- 41%.
Why, Shawn?
O'Hara, I think we got this one covered.
Spencer, why don't you get I'm sorry, did you bring a date to the crime scene?
It was either this or ice skating.
But I'm not anti-ice skating.
Do you have any idea how inappropriate that is?
More inappropriate than yelling at a co-worker in front of his date?
Why don't you zip it and let me assess what's going on here before you turn it into a psychic crap fest.
Dude, the chair.
The chair he stepped on.
To hang himself, legs would have kicked it backwards, and yet it's forward.
This is remedial stuff.
I do not believe this man was alone in the room when he died.
Enough!
I'm already onto something being fishy here without your help.
- Look at the position of the chair.
- Good boy, Lassie.
But come on, half-naked John Doe No wallet, no I.D. No identification.
There's no card with the It's got the I'm seeking what?
- An I.D. Card?
- There's not one.
Clearly you will need me to read the body.
Check the throat.
He's trying to tell me something, but he can't.
I was just about to say that.
Check his throat.
Are those dog tags?
Crap, this guy was a soldier.
- What does this mean?
- It means it's not just a possible homicide, now it's a military crime.
I may know someone who can help.
- Hey, little sis.
- Ewan, hi.
I am so sorry to bother you.
I know you must be busy, but I just have a couple of questions about this case.
I'm never too busy for you.
- I'm sorry, are you at work?
- Yeah, cleaning out the inbox as usual.
- Can I call you back?
- Sure, but it'll only take a minute.
Same here.
Dude!
- Hey, sis, I was just gonna - Alpha 4.
This is not your sister.
Yeah, I gather.
Funny you should call now.
Mission complete.
Your docs are safe and will be at the destination and hopefully dry by 1600.
America wins.
Just in time.
As usual, you're a credit to your country, Alpha Four.
Thank you for calling me back.
We have a soldier who was found hanging in this motel room.
- What happen, he kill himself?
- Well, maybe.
Maybe somebody wants us to think that.
Hey, do you know why a soldier would swallow his dog tags?
Unfortunately I do.
I saw it first hand in boot camp.
It's a symbol of shame.
Oh, man!
Are you crazy?
Suicide is a disgraceful act, especially for a soldier.
So what happens is they They swallow their dog tags.
Listen, how'bout we talk about this over dinner?
- You're in the country?
- Better yet, I'm in the state.
I'm headed towards Santa Barbara.
When?
I figure I'll float in around 9:00.
Great!
Psych 410 "You Can't Handle This Episode" Timing: Psych Team It's a big sandstorm.
We're in Dubai, and we're trying to grab the hindquarters, and finally I say "stop!
"You guys, we're gonna have to carry this camel the rest of the way".
Carry the camel is humpin' it out.
What?
That's That's an amazing story.
It sounds a little rehearsed, as if you've told it about a zillion times.
I've never told that story before.
This is the first time.
Really?
Maybe a little embellished?
A little exaggerated.
Believe me.
I do the same thing.
Actually, I left most of the crazy stuff out.
I didn't want to blow anybody's mind.
It was nothing, really.
But honestly, man, from what my sis tells me, you're the amazing one.
- You said that?
- I said you were prophetic.
What?
You're prophetic.
I was just really interested in your kind of police work.
Sure, I'm used to combat, the nitty-gritty, extreme danger.
But you You do things on a higher level.
What did Juliet say about me?
Plenty.
I'd tell you, but I'd have to kill you.
Great, now you're gonna tell everybody about our family road trip to Epcot, where you tortured me with Noogies?
Does the story end with him carrying the car the last 19 clicks?
Watch out.
You're never too old to hop on the train to Noogieville!
The claw!
Watch out!
This is great!
I am so glad you're here, and that you get to meet everybody.
Hey, I gotta ask.
Is that a Walther PPK on your ankle?
It is.
Good eye, detective.
May I?
- Here you go.
- Oh, that is sweet.
Are you licensed to carry in this state?
I'm licensed to carry on the planet.
It's one of 11 weapons on my person.
Anybody want to find where they're hidden?
All right, back to work, everyone.
Autopsy report confirms there was a severe neck fracture, probably not caused by the hanging.
Looks like Shawn's hunch about foul play might be right.
Let's pull out to the army base, figure out why our private Starks ended up dead in a motel room.
You should come with us.
- We could probably use your insight.
- And your 11 weapons.
Sorry, sir, we do not allow civilians access to this base.
I figured you might say that, soldier.
But I'm hardly a civilian.
I am the head detective for the Santa Barbara police department.
You don't have the clearances necessary I got you.
Gomer, Shawn Spencer, Paraguayan ambassador.
This is my attache, Ghee Buttersnaps, aka "the heater".
We are here to deliver a large ornamental fruit basket filled with native delicacies to whoever runs this joint.
Ewan O'Hara.
Is that a DOD TS security clearance?
It is, I can assure you these folks are not cause any trouble.
They just have a few questions to ask.
As a former member of this institution and a decorated soldier, perhaps you can explain to these civilians that while the United States army appreciates their concerns about private Starks, this is a military matter.
Absolutely, general.
But a soldier is dead.
I think these people are just trying to do their due diligence.
I assure you we will conduct a thorough investigation - internally here on our base.
- Here's the thing It didn't happen on your base.
So you and I can sit here and haggle over jurisdiction, which we both know is murky at best.
Or you can give us access to your base, let us do our work.
That, or we can start hauling soldiers down to the station.
The coroner found evidence that may conflict with the original theory of self-infliction.
Thank you, young lady.
I'll be happy to pass that report on to our highly skilled militarypathologist.
Major general I got nothing.
I just like saying that.
Those two words in sequence.
"Major general".
- Try it.
- I don't want to.
- Just say it.
- I don't want to.
General, I just got off the phone with Starks' parents.
They've requested to pick up his things.
Thank you, lieutenant Wallach.
Yes, I spoke to the boy's parents this morning myself.
Hardest call the army has to make.
- What is that?
- Sorry, sir.
It's my girlfriend Abigail.
She's been trying to reach me all day.
We're in a phase in our relationship that I simply can't get a handle on.
I would like to hear your thoughts.
I wouldn't presume to know your life.
Probably don't ask, don't tell.
I'm just gonna let it go to voice mail.
Indeed.
Pack up his things.
We will need to look through his belongings before.
And we're going to need to retrace his steps leading to his death.
We'd like to start with his work assignments.
Very well.
Escort these civilians down to private Starks' barracks, - to the motor pool, where he worked.
- Motor pool!
That's us.
We'll take the motor pool.
Dude, be all you can be.
We'll need one of those hummers.
The open hummers that we saw.
And my partner will require a corncob pipe.
Afternoon, soldier.
Ewan O'Hara.
This is Shawn Spencer.
He's a psychic detective helping the SBPD.
Investigating the suicide of private David Starks.
We heard.
It was a shame.
This is his partner Ghee Buttersnaps.
- That's not your real name.
- Oh, my gosh, - Juliet didn't even tell you my name?
- Gus, please, let's focus.
Your pettiness ions are interfering with my psychic ions, creating recepto non grata interfero bupkiss.
- What are you even talking about?
- This stuff is so cool.
How does this thing work?
Would you ask the Egyptians how they built the pyramids?
Would you ask Yo-Yo Ma how he makes music sound like heaven?
Would you ask Iron Mike Sharpe why he felt the need to shower for more than 90 minutes after wrestling for less than ten?
My point is, it's not a science.
For example, - what is this thing?
- An armored personnel carrier.
Of course it is.
I meant in at more philosophical level.
What is it?
I am sensing that private Starks was insubordinate and lazy.
A real sluff-off.
The opposite.
He was a model private.
One of the most conscientious soldiers in the squad, in fact.
Please, soldier, don't interrupt me.
Never do that.
That was the next thing I was going to say.
Model soldier.
Exemplary.
Pristine.
But I am sensing that he signed out of work last Monday, and instead went to dinner.
You must be getting "DNR", which stands for "Did Not Report".
Any reason?
The only official reason a soldier can legally sign out for work duty is due to a sickness or an injury, or for a meeting with a superior.
Excuse me, guys.
This is Alpha Four, go.
Alpha Four, what do you think you're doing?
I am on vacation.
But what, exactly, do you think you're doing on that base?
- How did you - Come on, Four.
You start flashing that clearance badge around and alarms go off.
I'm helping my sister and the SBPD with an investigation, and I don't see how any of that is your business.
Everything you do is my business, and everything that happens on that base is the army's business.
Your instructions, Alpha Four, are to keep it that way.
- I don't follow - Congratulations Don't touch that!
You just got yourself an assignment.
If there is a bad seed on that base, I want you to uncover them.
Your orders: do what it is you do to make sure it never sees the light of day.
Yes, sir.
Sir - The file your team asked for.
- Thank you, soldier.
It's Abigail.
Again.
You're acting like it's odd to be calling you on the phone.
No, the phone is a device that's been around for dozens of years.
That's not the odd part.
She's just being awfully clingy lately.
- Like I'm never doing enough.
- I don't know.
I think taking her to the dead guy show was pretty good.
You're right, I'm an idiot.
Before you even say anything, I want to apologize for the dog tags in the esophagus fiasco.
But I will be making it up to you tonight 8:00 p.m. Perfect.
So going through Starks's effects before they were sent off didn't raise any flags.
Good afternoon.
Nice of you to join us.
A lot has happened.
Maybe you'd like to try and catch up.
It is precisely 8:20 in the a.m. - What could possibly have happened?
- What, did you just run a marathon?
While I may have been sleeping late, I had very, very productive dreams.
I now know two new things.
One, the howler monkey that wears the overalls and plays the glockenspiel is my inner child pleading with me to cling to my innocence.
And two, the fact that Starks signed out of work on Monday means something.
I admire your fortitude Maybe I've been on the inside so long, but this thing smells of suicide.
Can you get us back onto the base?
It's not like the annual pass to Disneyland.
That was a very special circumstance.
You don't have to do that.
You've done enough already.
Thank you for getting us Starks' file.
You pulled some strings to do that.
I know.
I mean, I wish I could have turned something up for you guys - It's a tough break.
- Excuse us men.
Dude, somebody tampered with that file.
Captain America isn't interested in helping.
We need to get back on that base unsupervised.
And how?
Just go the base and beg to get back on again?
"Excuse me, officer, can we get back on the base, please"?
Come on, solider, we're gonna sneak on.
Under the radar.
Under the radar?
Under the radar.
Come on, dude, how was I supposed to know that they had real radar?
Look at the bright side.
We're in a Humvee!
Just what in the hell did you think you were gonna get away with?
You realize that this kind of idiocy will not be tolerated on my base!
Is there another type of idiocy that you would be more comfortable with?
Understood.
I hope this doesn't affect Gus and I's chances of enlisting.
Son, I'm not sure what makes either of you think you're army material.
I have two words for you: army psychic.
I'm giving you before I pitch it to CBS as a television idea.
We apologize, sir.
- And it will never happen again.
- That's more like it.
For the record, I have the utmost respect for the united states army, and all branches of the military.
Except, of course, the coast guard.
Did you see The guardian?
I'll be contacting your superiors about this incident.
There will be consequences.
- Consequences?
- Consequences!
He's gonna come back with a bar of soap wrapped in a towel!
Would you relax?
There's no way we're getting d'Onofrioed.
You tell him.
It was your psychic revelation.
I'm asking you as a favor.
As a friend.
Rock, paper, scissors.
Two out of three.
Just tell him.
Someone start telling me something, because I'm in the mood to staple heads.
All right, do you have any idea where Ewan was last night?
Why?
You and I both know that even Juliet can't tell us what Ewan does for the U.S. government.
And his past is some big secret.
He just breezes in and breezes out of the army base, and now, - he's reluctant to get us on?
- In all fairness, he barely knows you.
When we were P.O.Ws, we saw Ewan outside Felts' office.
- What was he doing there?
- For Pete's sake, if you have something to say, spit it out.
What is on your mind?
All right, right now, it's just a major hunch.
But I think Ewan is deeply involved in all of this.
You think O'Hara's brother's a murder?
Maybe.
How dare you accuse my brother of murder.
Jules, I'm not accusing.
At this point it's just a strong psychic hunch.
Just for the record, you charged both of my parents with murder on Christmas.
That's very true.
Just ask yourself, what is he doing here?
Why is he in Santa Barbara?
That's it?
That's your theory, that he's in town?
Try this theory on for size.
You always argue with your father, and you rarely even see your mother.
Maybe it's just hard for you to wrap your head around the fact that somebody might have a healthy, loving relationship with their family.
Other than being a war hero, has my brother done to bring on your suspicions?
He has an arsenal of weapons in his pants.
You might just try to mask your obvious jealousy for Ewan.
Jealousy of Ew What?
That's funny.
- How funny is that?
Laugh a little.
- It's pretty funny.
Because Ewan and I are basically the same person.
It's ridiculous.
Maybe your time would be better served if you were to concentrate on real, viable suspects in our midst.
Like Felts, for example.
This guy thinks he's king of the world because he's got stars on his chest.
I've got a badge, and that guy's going down.
Hello there, detective.
Please tell me i'm not going down before I've had my morning coffee.
Major general, thank you for coming down.
To be honest, we were just expecting a phone call.
Young lady, we didn't have phones in Nha Trang when I took down nine men with my bare hands.
Perhaps we could talk in private?
In here.
Go home.
- Major general, you care to sit down?
- Did you know of the 39 men who signed our declaration of independence, when they did it.
This country was built from a standing position.
I'm good.
Thank you for the history lesson.
Now to matters of this century.
This murder isn't going away, and neither are we.
We want some answers.
I came down here as a courtesy to you.
But if you're gonna turn this into an interrogation, detective, you'd better be prepared to stick bamboo shoots under my fingernails.
I didn't think so.
I will be back at that base with warrants!
A stack of 'em!
Did you forget how to get home?
'cause we can have an officer take you.
We both know how we can get back on that base.
Sorry, you've accused my brother of murder, and now you want to use him?
We have a stake in this investigation, so let's investigate.
That is our jobs, remember?
This brother thing is just a hunch.
But I am a psychic, which means I need top be near him in order to read him.
Now, what are you afraid of?
That I can prove I'm right?
That's just how you'll prove that you're wrong.
How many men would you say you've killed?
Of the four of us, your brother's the only one who's killed a man, unless we're counting accidental deaths, in which case Gus is in the running.
You don't have to defend yourself.
I'm simply wondering how it feels.
I hope you never have to find out.
Snap.
- I asked for that.
- Yes, you did.
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you not to touch the weapons.
What is this?
That is an anti-tank weapon.
And you're pointing it at yourself.
You used to work with Starks in the motorcade, did you not?
Yes, I did.
But you know that.
How do you know that?
There's only a certain jobs a private can be assigned to on a base like this.
Deductive reasoning.
Clipboard, please.
- Sir?
- Clipboard, please, sir.
Starks touched this clipboard.
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do, soldier.
I think you do.
If you have information, you better tell us.
One of the privates may have had a girlfriend.
And he may have snuck off the base that night to see her.
And he may have had his pal Starks sub in for him and man his shift.
Starks normally works the motor pool, so he knew nothing about weapon inventory.
- Isn't that risky?
- It's pretty simple.
Machine supplies come in, trucks pick 'em up.
Simple.
Starks saw something that night that he wasn't supposed to.
The question is What was it?
What is the status, Four?
It's a little early for a cocktail, isn't it?
Not on this coast.
Now tell me you've wrapped this thing up.
I've tried everything to slow it down.
I've turned 'em the wrong way.
I've shredded evidence.
This Shawn Spencer character is very good at what he does.
Starks was onto something, and Spencer's close.
Are you telling me you can't handle some local psychic?
I'm gonna follow his lead to the target, then I'll deal with it.
It's perfect.
Okay, Four.
But be in touch.
And in case you weren't sure, that's an order.
You think you could get Gus and I back on the base late night?
Not a problem.
This is nice.
Yeah, it is.
Just you and me.
Me and you.
I'm talking about us, man.
I'm talking about this Being in a relationship, spending the time, spooning it up, it's I'm sorry, do you have somewhere to be?
That's ridiculous.
I would never do that.
Why would I I'm sorry.
I had every intention of making this an amazing date.
I did.
I just I have to work.
Maybe if I had a normal job with regular hours, - like you do - You're missing the point.
- I'm not totally available to you.
- Listen to me There are things that I have to do, because I have to do them, and they don't involve our relationship.
I'm going to Uganda!
The city?
It's a country.
I knew that.
Tell me you're not having an affair with Kamala.
Kamala the wrestler?
His real name is Jim Harris, and he's not from Uganda, he's from Mississippi.
God, I love that you know that.
All right.
- When do you leave?
- Two days.
- How long?
- Six months.
Maybe longer.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.
It all just happened really fast.
It's this amazing program, all right.
It's called "one kid one world".
I'm gonna be helping to build and design this school, and I'm gonna teach kids who are just desperate to learn.
- It sounds nice.
- That's why I've been pressuring you - to get together, so I could tell you.
- Really?
You couldn't have slipped it in anywhere before right now, this second?
I thought about it right after the coroner pulled the dog tags out of that guy's mouth.
Come on.
Have the conversation that we would have had if I had told you.
Fine, I would have asked you not to go.
I would say that that is completely unfair because I've been waiting for this opportunity for six years.
And I'd ask you to come with me.
I would say that's not very fair.
Because Psych is here and Gus is here.
And what am I supposed to do in Uganda for six months or longer?
Where does that leave us, then?
Now, that's a fair question.
- Okay, it's the last one.
- Got it, sarge.
Thanks for scoring us these dope army costumes.
They're not costumes.
They're government-issue uniforms.
I wonder where that truck is going.
Any chance it's Uganda?
Shawn, are you okay?
Thanks, buddy.
There's only one way to find out.
We gotta get on that truck.
Ewan, how would you normally handle a situation like this?
Take 'em out.
A little elaborate.
Somewhat unorthodox.
But possibly genius.
Do we still have the number for that guy who can get us tickets for Raw?
Kirano.
But that's not what he meant.
Wait a minute, you mean you would kill them?
Not right away.
But usually I'm dealing with the enemy.
These guys are on our side.
What do you guys do?
It's called creating a diversion.
How does that work?
What are you doing out of your barracks after lights out, son?
I was just taking a stroll.
Taking a stroll?
What are you, soldier, some kind of dandy?
- Get down on the ground.
- I'm sorry?
Hit the deck, maggot!
All right, you start giving me push-ups, and I mean good ones, all the way up and all the way down, or you will start over.
Start!
- You miss your mommy yet?
- I do, - I guess.
- You guess?
You have a girly you write to back home?
No, but I gave that a thought lately.
You think I want to hear a monologue about your feelings?
- No no, sir.
- Keep going!
- Do you even want to be here?
- I don't know.
- I'm not too sure.
- Not too sure?
I will ask you again.
- Do you want to be here?
- I do, sir!
- Why is that, private?
- I got nowhere else to go!
I got nowhere else to Pathetic!
Sergeant Powell keeps sending me you guys!
Nice, buddy.
You were totally doing lines from an officer and a gentleman.
I don't know where it came from.
Lou Gossett was like my pretend dad after that movie.
I felt the same way after Enemy Mine.
Over here.
It's Wallach?
He had his own operation selling weapons.
This must be what Starks saw.
He had a conscience.
He didn't blindly follow, he questioned, - and he reported it to Wallach.
- But he was the wrong person to tell.
Wallach killed him in that motel room.
And don't be offended by this, but I thought it was you who was somehow behind all this.
I've never met a man who's so big he couldn't hide behind a plane.
We need to make a plan.
Stay here!
Let's go!
You said to stay here.
- "Stay here".
That's what you said!
- You can move now.
Let's go.
Come on!
Wallach sees us from a distance, breaks into a crate, pulls out a gonna-36, and he's gone.
We might have had a chance, but it's all speculation.
I owe you an apology.
I was wrong.
For accusing my brother?
No, I was gonna say you were right.
I looked it up Eve Plumb did do 3 episodes of The Love Boat, playing 3 different characters.
Turns out she has a lot more range than I gave her credit for.
Now that I'm thinking of it, I was also wrong to accuse your brother.
He saved our lives and, well, I owe him for that.
- That is very sweet.
- Yes, it is.
What's more, I really mean it.
I'm sure you do.
But it's not that easy this time.
Listen up!
At ease.
At this moment, and against my better judgment, I'm gonna overlook the blatant disregard for the rules of the US army, and say thank you to Shawn Spencer and his partner Ghee Buttersnaps, for their efforts to uncover Wallach's criminal misconduct.
We have identified the missing weapons and are now tracking them.
And to one of our own, Ewan O'Hara, for his heroic actions in this albeit unauthorized operation.
We have a man on the run.
We're gonna find him.
So here are the parameters for "operation manhunt".
Excuse me, Major General, sir.
Are you open to suggestions for alternate names to "operation manhunt"?
It seems a little on the nose, sir.
First order of business, we're gonna do a lockdown of the base.
No one gets in, no one gets out.
Then I want an inventory done of all the arms rooms on the installation.
Look, man, I don't know what the rules are for saving lives these days, but I want you to know that if you ever need anything xeroxed or mimeographed or alphabetized, Gus is your man.
Not necessary.
I'm just glad you guys are okay.
Listen, I'm sorry I couldn't be there to help you net Wallach, but I'm sure you guys will do it.
Army has a way of weeding out bad seeds.
Are you leaving?
Yeah, I got a flight, 0430.
Wouldn't happen to be to Uganda, would it?
You know, It's funny that Major General Felts turned out to be the good guy.
If I hadn't seen great Santiniso many times I would have seen that sooner.
Duvall.
Yeah, Duvall.
If Starks didn't die, he would have had that appointment with Felts, and Felts would have figured out this whole weapons thing a lot sooner.
Man Ewan, you don't have to do that.
You've already done enough.
And thanks for Starks' file.
I know you had to pull some strings.
I wish we could have turned something for you.
Tough break.
It just smells like suicide.
You used to work with Starks.
Yes, I did.
But you know that.
How do you know that?
- Dude, where's Ewan?
- He left.
My God, I was wrong.
I mean I was right.
I was right, and then wrong.
- Now I'm right again.
- You're not making any sense.
We have to follow Ewan.
He's up to something.
I'll explain on the way.
Where are those guys going?
- Let's call Lassiter.
- No time for that.
We gotta get down.
I got all the time.
I'd like to live.
All this time I thought you were trying to help us uncover the truth.
But really you were trying to slow us down so that you could get to him first.
- We each have our job.
- Yes, we do.
I've had many jobs.
I'm not sure which one you're referring to.
My guess is that it's not my brief stint as a lobbyist for M&Ms, trying to get them to bring back the light brown ones.
But let's not get caught up in one another's achievements.
Suffice to say we both have very impressive resumes.
Let's just talk Man to much smaller, less fit man.
All right, Wallach here broke an army code.
A code based on allegiance, honor, honesty.
How'bout this, Ewan How'bout I bring the cops in here?
And we arrest this guy, slap some cuffs on him.
How satisfying will that be to watch?
I'll make sure Lassie makes 'em tight so that they chafe and they flake.
You know you sister will get the collar.
That's a bonus.
I'm not taking Wallach anywhere.
- Wait a second.
You gonna kill him?
- Yes, Gus.
I believe that's what the cocking of the gun was meant to mean.
You wouldn't be this lost if you would come closer.
You know how I feel about piers.
They are covered in pelican urine.
Everything you touched is soaked in it.
I'm good where I am.
You're a good detective.
You've got a good thing going here.
On top of that, my sister likes you and so do I. But we all have orders.
And I'm still alive because I follow mine.
Why don't you and your buddy Seriously?
The name is Gus!
Turn around, walk out.
Forget you ever saw me.
Go have a drink.
Toast to a job well done.
Leave me to do what I have to do.
We can live with that, can't we?
I can't.
Easy, little sis.
Drop it, Ewan.
We both know you're not gonna shoot your older brother.
No, but I will.
I could make this very complicated for you right now.
What is this even about?
You're protecting the army from some bad publicity?
What happened to the Ewan I knew?
You know you're the reason I became a cop?
You gave me the confidence to go for it, and I did.
I became one.
And now I have a job to do and that is to uphold the law.
And no one is above that.
Wallach is gonna go to jail for what he did, and so are you.
You are under arrest for the attempted murder of lieutenant W. Wallach of the united states army.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
For the record, I really hate that I was right.
Me too.
This must be hard for you.
I mean, I have family members I would love to see go to prison, but this must be tough.
He broke the law.
That's all there is to it for me.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a prisoner Ewan O'Hara?
Sorry, he's not here.
Is he on a different bus?
No, ma'am, there's no record of a Ewan O'Hara.
Now boarding from 665 Are you sure you don't want to come visit?
Maybe.
I mean it's It's not out of the question.
It's the hole in the ground as a toilet thing that's giving me pause.
I won't even tell you about the whole toiletpaper situation.
I'll be thinking about you, though.
I think we'll both be doing our share of that.
Tell me one more time exactly when you get back.
Right, I'll be back for a little bit on February 24th, so I'm going to circle it on my calendar.
Now boarding flight 665 to LAX with international connections.
Now boarding flight 665 to Los Angeles international airport.
Ticket, please.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
What in blue blazes is going on?
You're up on the roof in this weather?
Nothing, Dad.
We were just practicing base jumping.
It's the newest thing in extreme sports.
Are you crazy?
You could get yourself hurt or maybe even killed doing something like this.
Don't worry.
We made life-size replicas of ourselves to make sure the chutes would work.
Mine's over there.
We've made improvements since then.
Base jumping.
There's no way I'm gonna let you do something that risky.
- But, dad?
- But nothing.
As long as you live in my house you follow my rules.
Now, I want you to clean this stuff up, come inside, and do your homework.
Gus, come on.
You're smarter than this.
One day I won't be living in your house.
Then I'll be able to take any risk I want.
What about that?
When you and Gus are 30 years old you can go out and be as wild and reckless as you want.
Best idea ever.
People say our intense love of bunnies is creepy at our age, but history will prove them to be heartless bastards.
I can't believe the French actually eat these little guys.
- The French aren't the only ones.
- I wasn't counting other rabbits.
- Rabbits don't eat each other.
- Most rabbits, yes.
No, pretty much all.
This conversation will only end badly.
The thing is - I have something big to tell you.
- You know you can say anything to me.
We've known each other forever and there is nothing - that could dent our bond.
- I have a secret girlfriend.
You're dead.
I can't believe you.
You brought me here to get hopped up on bunny love so I wouldn't make a scene.
- Pretty much.
- It's working.
I don't even remember what this whole thing was about.
This bunny is strong.
Must be Columbian.
Her name is Ruby.
I met her at BevMo!
She's in marketing.
And she's really, really cool.
- She's not taking you to the cleaners?
- All my cash is tied up in dress shirts - and decorative pillowcases.
- Fair.
- Why are you waiting till just now?
- Because I wanted to make sure that what we had was real and solid.
I didn't want you screwing things up.
Your decision could have repercussions for years to come.
The thing is, you have a tendency to scare my girlfriends away.
Because I ask a few simple questions?
You asked if she knew the answer to the Riddle of the Sphinx.
And bullet dodged.
You're very welcome.
You knew because you saw it on Super friends.
She had the same opportunity to see that episode.
All right, you.
What are you doing?
Pick that bunny back up.
I will not be easily swayed or impressed by the effects of an intense adorability high.
As far as I'm concerned she's starting here.
And she's gotta get to here.
It's not gonna be easy.
When do I meet her?
- In about three seconds.
- Three seconds Hi, handsome.
- Right back at ya.
- She was talking to me.
Ruby, this is Shawn.
It's good to meet you.
Sorry I ran late.
My last appointment ran long.
She volunteers at the Wildlife Rescue.
We were just cleaning up the ducks that got caught up in the oil spill.
Wait a minute.
That sounded a little rehearsed.
- Did he give you that?
- You are as kooky as Gus advertised.
Although, you, mister, did not do justice to that hair.
My God, most guys I know would kill for that mane.
Some have.
Well, not me.
I like Gus's head.
It would be a crime to cover this up.
- Got some questions for you Rubes.
- Shoot.
- Anything.
- Anything?
- Good.
Favorite color.
- Black.
- Liar.
- Prove it.
- Flavor.
- Of what?
- Everything.
- Mango.
- Too easy.
- Anything else?
Favorite Magnum, P.I. episode.
Did you see the Sun Rise?
- Second favorite episode.
- Did you see the Sun Rise: Part two?
Actually, reverse those two.
My God, who are you?
- It was good to meet you, Shawn.
- It was good to meet you, Rubes.
- You've exceeded all expectations.
- Oh, thank you.
And might I say that you and Gus have one of the most rich and fulfilling friendships that I've ever seen.
We're like Andie and Duckie with just a tad of Mary Kate and Ashley.
- Aren't we glad that that's over?
- Yes, we are.
I guess all that's left now is for me to meet your friends.
- You mean, for me to meet her friends.
- No, I had it right the first time.
We can change it to we.
When do we get to meet your friends?
I'm free now.
Ten minutes from now.
Roughly, an hour from now.
- Anytime between now and tonight.
- That's a little short notice.
I would love to, - but I have this thing planned today.
- We would love to come.
Okay, normally I would say great Seriously but we're meeting at Berman's bend down by the river and we only have so many supplies.
Not enough supplies.
We'll put something on the books for next week.
Good.
Thank you.
Sounds good, sounds good.
You know that's right.
I can't believe we're crashing their picnic.
- You asked me to vet this woman.
- No, I didn't.
Regardless, when I vet someone I vet until there is no vetting left to vet.
That is how I vet.
- Ruby passed your test.
- She was good at the pet store.
She was prepared.
Gotta catch her and her friends unaware before they have a chance to get their story straight.
I like this woman.
I don't want you to mess it up for me.
Dude, deep down, you want this to happen.
You want me to do this so that you can avoid another Mira situation.
Or have you already forgotten the woman you married after only two days?
Ruby is not Mira.
And I don't need you to tell me whether a woman is right for me.
You sure about that?
Almost.
- Dude.
- Fine, 81%.
Then let the vetting continue.
- I'm sorry we're dropping in.
- But we agreed to do this next week.
- We don't have enough supplies.
- We brought our own gruyere.
I think you wanted to catch me off guard to see what I was like with my friends, didn't you?
That's what I thought.
This is Gus and Shawn.
These are my friends.
This is Derek Walker.
Jessica Martino and my other friend Stu Crawford.
Stu Sounds like I'm booing.
Right?
But I'm not.
I'm saying Stu, because I'm a fan of yours and your guys' whole team.
I'm sorry we're crashing in on your River rafting.
River rafting?
We thought you guys were having a picnic.
You know, 'cause it's lunch time.
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.
Let me explain.
Lunch for us starts ten minutes after breakfast ends and goes till ten minutes before dinner starts.
Unless we just combine the two, in which case we have linner.
And then there's dessinner, which is dessert and dinner.
You're fun.
You're not crashing anything.
We got plenty of room.
Go see Gunther, he'll fix you up.
- And meet us down by the river.
- Sweet.
Are you sure this is waterproof?
You barely get wet.
I've done this hundreds of times.
- It's a small world doesn't count.
- All right, fine, Mr. Qualifier.
Guys, please, let us help with that.
I've met each of you now.
And I'm sure you're more than a little curious about me.
Actually, I am.
Ruby says you're a psychic?
Can you turn on your powers and predict my future?
Derek, I'm a diviner.
Not a blender.
The psychic realm decides when it wants to communicate with me.
Though I am sensing that Stu here is the expert.
That's right.
He is the most experienced of the group.
It was his idea to come here today.
That's pretty good.
What else can you tell?
Well, I can tell you that Jessica here is a bit of a free spirit.
Single but looking.
Not afraid to make the first move.
Nice.
How'd you know that?
She's tickling my ass.
That was completely by accident.
This time.
So, Ruby, you still haven't told me how you and your friends met.
Derek and Stu met at a wildlife preservation meeting, which is kind of ironic because Derek used to be a big game hunter back when he was dating Jessica.
Yeah, I went to Africa with him twice, but only for the pictures.
I look really good in a safari outfit.
I bagged the big 5, then I turned over a new leaf.
Big 5?
Mouse, squirrel, turtle, Chad Michael Murray?
I always forget the last one, though.
None of those are right.
He's talking about African game hunting.
Anyway, so Jessica and I, we work together and that's how we met.
And then when Derek and Jessica broke up we really wanted them to stay friends.
That way we just, we didn't break the group up.
- That's cool and mature.
- We're a tight group.
We look out for one another.
Isn't that right, guys?
We're not an easy group to keep up with, which is why I gotta hand it to you two.
You seem really at ease in the situation.
I'm into sales so I'm used to meeting new people.
- What's that noise?
- You might call me a people person.
In fact, in high school I was voted most well-liked and king of howdy-day.
- Only time it's ever happened.
- Are we on a flight path?
You really fooled us.
We would never think that you would be into extreme stuff.
- Extreme stuff?
- Like that?
Here we go.
It's all about taking it to the next level.
- What are the whistles for?
- In case we get lost.
Lost?
Paddle forward!
Paddle forward!
You must be out of your damn mind!
- Help me, lord!
- Ask him to help me too!
Are those rocks real?
Flex your core.
It's the next level.
Jessica's hand is still on my thigh!
Are you okay?
Where's Stu?
Stu, can you hear us?
Where are you?
Psych 411 "Thrill Seekers & Hell Raisers" Timing: Psych Team Did either of you see when this guy Stu fell out of the boat?
There was so much water pummeling our face we couldn't see anything.
- Mostly consisting of Gus's tears.
- You can't prove that.
The truth is, I found it pretty exhilarating.
The only thing I can compare it to is I found out you could have brownies.
Except in this case, a human being is missing.
- That part was not cool.
- Damn right it's not.
Can you believe they do this dangerous stuff all the time?
They're adrenaline junkies.
People who enjoy extreme activities.
I know what adrenaline junkies are.
Am I crazy, but isn't the fact that Ruby likes to tempt death for thrills information that should have been disclosed on the first date?
If only you knew someone who could've vetted that out beforehand.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
I should've warned you.
And that I'm into extreme sports.
You should have.
I was just really afraid that it was gonna freak you out.
I mean, some guys get really freaked out by stuff like that.
And I don't know, I'm sure you have too, especially now with Stu, and I just really hope he's okay.
Me too.
But the truth is, none of this scared me off.
Really?
May I have a word with you in the "stop saying crazy things to Ruby" room please?
Give us a second.
- You said you were gonna break up.
- I changed my mind.
- When?
- Now.
Man, she likes to almost die and so do her friends.
It's like we walked into Final Destination.
We walked out of final destination.
Bottom line, she's been vetted.
- It's time to push the eject button.
- I'm not ready to do that.
Make sure CSI covers this whole area.
- That's Stu's vest.
- What happened?
Did you find him?
I'd rather leave that to the professionals.
It would be inappropriate for me to speculate at this time.
Please, we can handle it.
My best guess, the life vest came off when he fell out of the boat.
He hit his head on a rock and he drowned.
We'll probably find his body in a gully or a spillway somewhere down the river.
I just hope that we get to him before the birds do.
They said they could handle it.
Classy, Lassie, but you're right.
Stu did go overboard.
But you're not gonna find his body in a spillway because he didn't hit his head and he definitely didn't drown.
So he just what, turned into a fish and swam away?
Don't be ridiculous.
A cat like Stu would never reach into Costner's bag of tricks.
But I am pretty sure he swam away.
Obviously Stu used the hooks to attach himself to something in the water.
- But why would he do that?
- I'm not entirely sure.
Guys.
We got news on the missing person.
I just got a call from the diving team.
They found high-strength netting on the bottom of a big boulder in the rapids.
Let me tell you how this went down.
Stu knew exactly where to jump.
It happened in rough water so that no one would notice that he was gone.
He waited for the raft to drift around a bend and he made his way to shore.
But I don't get it.
Why would Stu want to make that?
Because of this.
Clearance sale at mattress discounters.
Seems redundant.
No, this.
Stu and his business partner Brian Sampson just filed for bankruptcy.
Sampson, that's just a great name.
Straight out of film noir.
An old detective who drinks hard but loves even harder.
Or go with me here.
A tiny little orphan mouse who must find his way home to Wolverhampton.
Or Samson the legendary figure from the Bible.
No, that doesn't work.
All those guys have names like Ben-Hur and Prometheus.
You have never read the Bible have you?
Genesis, exorcist, leviathan, do the right thing.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Stop talking.
We've gotta find this Brian Sampson, because if this is true, given the complexity of Stu's escape there is no way he could've done this by himself.
He's right.
No, that's Stu's seat.
Gus, a word.
What?
Bad news first.
I'm almost positive Ruby's the one who helped Stu.
But here's the good news, we can use Ruby, - solve the case, and look like heroes.
- You are unbelievable.
Really unbelievable.
You've convinced yourself that Ruby is wrong for me and now you're fishing for some reason to justify it?
Man, I know this is hard to hear but I'm pretty sure she was involved.
The only thing she's involved in, Shawn, is being awesome.
- All right.
Maybe I'm wrong.
- Damn right you are.
Maybe I'm being overprotective because the way the Mira thing went down.
I appreciate you looking after me, but Ruby is not Mira.
- She's guilty to be awesome.
- That's right.
- Have your parents met her?
- No.
They're at a time-share pitch in Chula Vista.
- I'll go with her when they get back.
- In the meantime, I've got the next best thing.
- Where's Chula Vista?
- I don't know.
I think they made it up.
So my hands are all bloody and blistered from three hours of fighting to reel in this marlin, when all of a sudden I realize that we've drifted into Cuban waters.
And I know this because one of their patrol boats proceeds to blow a hole the size of a bowling ball in our hull.
- This bourbon packs a wallop.
- Not too strong for you?
I'm paying you a compliment.
Not strong enough.
- Try this.
- So what happened next?
We turned and we ran for our lives.
We made it, like, around five miles off the coast of key west before she sank and then we had to swim the rest of the way.
We ended up sitting in with the house band at sloppy Joe's soaking wet.
That is the best damn fish story I've ever heard.
Cheers.
That was my friend, Stu.
He planned the whole trip.
Look, I'm pretty sure wherever he is he's okay.
I better check on the burgers.
What do you think you're doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm making my world-famous burgers.
You are supposed to be helping me prove that Ruby is hiding something.
Instead you're swapping fishing stories with her.
And what is that nonsense about you catching the bluefin tuna?
You found it on the beach and practically tripped over it.
Come on, Shawn, look.
That's what you do.
It's a fishing story, you embellish.
You think you're trying to help Gus.
You usually are.
But in this case, I'm not so sure.
Why would you say that?
Look, is it possible, just possible, that your suspicions of Ruby stem from your jealousy that Gus is in a healthy, solid relationship with a great woman, whereas you had one with an equally great woman but you let her slip away?
How much have you had to drink?
More than a little and less than enough.
But I make sense, don't I?
Looks like you're a big hit with Shawn's dad.
Yeah, but the only one that I can't win over is Shawn.
It's like he doesn't trust me.
He was a little suspicious about you at first.
Suspicious?
How so?
I probably shouldn't tell you.
We'll probably have a big laugh.
He had this crazy theory caught up in his head about how you helped Stu orchestrate his disappearance.
The cops said that Stu used some kind of webbing to attach himself to a rock.
And Shawn has it caught up in his head that you helped him orchestrate it.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
He's really psychic.
Wait a second, you mean he's right?
You did?
Stu is my best friend in the world.
He just said that he was in some kind of trouble and he needed a few days to figure things out.
Wait, you need to tell the police about this now.
I can't.
Stu begged me to give him a few days.
I'm the only person in the world that he can trust.
You're the only person that I can trust.
So you know what this means?
We're in a trust circle.
No, no, I want out of the trust circle.
There are no doors.
- What about Shawn?
- That would be a trust triangle.
Don't make this more difficult than it already is.
Please, please, please?
You have to promise me you're not gonna say anything to Shawn.
For me?
- I promise.
- Thank you.
Smiths lyric-off.
You, me, 10 minutes.
I'm gonna wipe the floor with you.
We're starting with the queen is dead.
I wanna tell you something.
Will you look at me, please?
I just had a drunken revelation out there.
It wasn't mine, it was my dad's, but at this point, I'll take it.
I was way off about Ruby, and I admit it.
She's amazing.
In fact, I wish we could clone her.
And then maybe the clone would come off a little slow.
Not like she has special needs, just like a little bit dim, and that would be perfect for me.
Truth is, I think I was just jealous, 'cause you have something special and I haven't heard from Abigail in, - like, a month or something.
- I appreciate your honesty.
So what were you and Rubes talking about?
- I got your message.
What's up?
- We haven't get a hold of Sampson.
Great name.
Sounds like one of the dwarf warriors from Willow.
We've been through this already.
Sampson is Stu's partner.
We were able to track down Sampson and Stu's assistant, Charles Lucas.
Lassiter has him in room "A" - Claims he knows nothing.
- You want me to get in and read him, Because I can always tell when someone is hiding something.
Isn't that right?
Why do you look away when I talk?
You did that all morning.
Something in my eye.
- What is it?
- Monkey brush.
Never heard.
So now you're gonna tell me Monkey brush doesn't even exist?
Don't be the new Meshach Taylor.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're not going to leave this room, Lucas, Until you start telling me the truth.
Saying "the truth" louder than the previous words isn't going to work.
I've told you the truth.
I don't know anything.
Thanks.
We'll take it from here.
Let's get one thing straight, you are here just to observe this interrogation.
- Understood?
- Absolutely.
I've got something.
You were at the river the day that Stu disappeared.
I was there.
But only because Stu asked me to drop him off and drive his car down river so he wouldn't catch a ride back, then I called a cab and went home.
You're lying.
He's not lying.
His lip is completely still, no sweat on forehead, fingers aren't trembling.
- You're hiding something.
- No, I'm not.
- I want the truth.
- That is the truth.
- Who are we interrogating?
- Gus, what are you hiding?
I'm not hiding anything.
You're crazy.
- Say he's crazy.
- No, he's hiding something.
Let's go.
- Can I leave now?
- Quiet.
- Dude, Ruby said something to you?
- Who?
Ruby, who's only guilty of being awesome.
They found a body in the woods.
It's Stu's business partner.
The lovable saint Bernard next door, and don't realize how big he is.
Looks like an hunting accident.
But get this, I found out that Sampson and Stu took out million-dollar life insurance and named each other as beneficiary.
- You think Stu killed Brian for money.
- It's motive.
Gus, there's nothing you'd like to say?
I gotta go.
Ruby, I need to talk to you.
Hi, come on up.
Are you nuts?
That's dangerous.
I know it seems weird, But this is kind of our coping mechanism.
Okay, this is getting ridiculous.
Whatever you and Ruby conspired to do is just as bad.
We're talking about murder here.
- You have to tell me what you know.
- I can't talk to you right now.
You kidding me?
Dude, this is me.
I am your partner and your best friend.
We are not supposed to keep secrets.
- I know, but it's complicated.
- No, math is complicated.
The show it's complicated was complicated.
The song complicated by Avril Lavigne, ironically, not very complicated.
And you know what?
Neither is this.
I didn't expect to see you here.
Look who's learning to be the aggressive one.
I am not here to see you.
Yeah, and I'm wearing panties.
Listen to me, we have a responsibility to the police.
If you know something and we don't tell, that's lying.
So should I tell them you're not really psychic?
How did you get from "a" to "b"?
Hey, buddy, what are you doing here?
You know, I'm just chasing after Jessica.
Yeah, don't they all.
I don't know if this means anything, but you would make a great couple.
Maybe I should give you my key to her apartment.
Maybe.
You know, that way, you can get in.
I got it.
I do.
- Stop letting Ruby come between us.
- I'm not gonna let that happen.
What's going on?
Ruby, I can't do this anymore.
I need to let Shawn in our trust circle.
I didn't hear that.
Ruby, the police think that Stu may have killed Brian Sampson.
- Brian's dead?
- Yeah.
I know that you helped stage Stu's disappearance.
Yeah, I know you know that.
- Gus told you?
- Of course he did.
But Stu Stu could've never killed Brian.
- No matter how much Brian deserved it.
- What does that mean?
Brian was the reason that Stu was going broke.
He used all of the company's money to pay for his exorbitant lifestyle.
It's always about money.
Tell him everything, Ruby.
We need to know where Stu is.
- Where do you think you're going?
- With you to the police station.
I don't think so.
Now that Ruby's told us Stu is hiding at Lone Pine, we've to tell the police.
Correction.
I have to tell the police.
You have to crawl back under your keeping-secrets -from-your-best-friend and apply for residency where you can vote and pay your taxes and make little backstabbing rock babies.
- Have we to do this?
- Yes.
I'm questioning your dedication to this case, our partnership, and maybe even America.
I'm dedicated.
I take our job seriously.
Please, you are so distracted by Ruby and her boobs and your lies and the heavy petting, you probably don't remember who's Jason.
- Stu.
- Or who he kidnapped.
He didn't kidnap anyone.
He disappeared.
Right off the top of a building in Vancouver.
- That was a who didn't steal anything.
- And then fell down a mine shaft.
That was us.
Look, give it up, Shawn.
My trust circle with Ruby resisted, I've been paying just as much attention - to what's been going on as you have.
- You can't have a circle with 2 people.
So let's set aside our personal issues and continue on our investigation.
Please, you wish you had my acute observational skills.
- You wish you had my focus.
- My attention to detail.
Attention to detail, please.
All right, people, listen up.
By piecing together Stu's credit card activity, phone records, and known sightings the last three weeks, we've pinpointed his location to here: a small ranch outside of Reno, Nevada.
We need to coordinate with all state and local law enforcement agencies.
Psychic navigators are saying something different, Lassie.
- Cut that out before to blind somebody.
- As usual, Lassie, you're way off.
The actual position where Stu is hiding is here, right outside of Lone Pine.
And you know this how?
Same way I knew that Stu had fled in the first place.
The question is, Lassie, do you want to mobilize your team to Nevada and risk humiliating yourself, or do you wanna mobilize them to Lone Pine, which is on the way, and only risk humiliating me?
Everybody, let's head to Lone Pine.
Stay put, Spencer.
Stu Crawford, it's the SBPD.
We're coming in.
I'm still more than a little peeved at you for keeping all this from me.
I'm sorry, Shawn, but you know, eventually we're gonna both get married.
There's gonna be certain things we can't share.
I'm trying not to think about that.
- We're still gonna live next door.
- With a pool going across our yards.
I've got dibs on the diving board.
Why don't you get in there?
Well, you had everything right, Spencer.
He definitely didn't drown in the river.
I know this must be very hard.
But Stu didn't leave a suicide note, Is there anything that you can tell us?
I've known Stu for years, and none of this makes any sense.
I still can't believe he's gone.
Now, Ruby's already informed us of her involvement with Stu's disappearance.
If either of you two were involved, now's the time to tell us.
They don't know anything about it.
Actually, Stu came to me first saying that he needed a place to hide.
I told himto stop being a coward and just face his problems like a man.
Stu told me that I was the only person that he trusted.
That is so like you to think you're the special one in the group.
- Everything's about Ruby.
- I need attention?
You're the one that throws herself at every guy.
Take it back, bitch!
- Ladies, simmer down.
- Hold on chief, make her.
Can you try to make her.
Look, miss Martino, we know that you've had some court-appointed anger management sessions and a prior for stalking Stu's business partner Brian Sampson.
Oh, that?
Stu introduced us at a party and we totally hit it off.
And then Brian started sending me mixed signals.
Mixed signals.
Let's just say that you're a person of interest and we'd like you to stay in town.
Fine.
- Am I free to go too, now?
- Yeah, you too, miss J. Wait for me outside?
The preponderance of evidence still points to Stu being responsible for Brian Sampson's murder.
In view of the performance we witnessed, we should re-review said evidence.
You can't re-review something, It's redundant.
Like re-repeat or re-reflect.
You can if you've peated and flected twice.
I remind you that you haven't been hired on this case, and what you say doesn't matter?
- We haven't been hired?
- Nobody hired me.
We'll call you if we need you.
I'm sorry about Stu.
I'm sorry about putting you in this situation.
You were doing a good thing for a great friend.
- I can't be mad at that.
- Thank you for understanding.
So now that everything's out in the open, let's agree.
- No more secrets.
- OK, agreed, yes.
No more secrets.
- All right.
- All right.
Bottle and weave.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Divorced.
Baby daddy?
- Credit?
- 770.
Not bad.
Oh, you guys.
This is so nice.
This feels good.
I knew you were special from the beginning.
You had me at Did you see the Sunrise: Part two.
I'm gonna wait in the car.
- All right.
- All right.
I was right about her from the beginning.
She is amazing.
I am 110% on the Ruby train now.
Good, she just lost a dear friend.
She needs us, Gus.
We're her rock.
- You mean, I'm her rock.
- Yes, you're her rock.
- I'm her anchor.
- Stop it.
- Stop what?
- You know what.
- That?
- Yes, that.
I only did that 'cause you said stop doing this.
If I stop that, then what?
Stop stopping it.
I think I know what's going on.
You feel bad that you were against Ruby from the beginning so you're trying to overcompensate by pushing your way into our relationship.
But I'm not upset, because I know deep down it's just your way of saying I have a good thing in Ruby and you don't wanna see me lose it.
All right, you console your lady.
I'll handle the case for a while.
- The case we didn't get hired on?
- You know how I roll.
Hey, old buddy, raise your hand if you've missed you.
Hold on, let me guess.
Police won't let you in on another case.
You want me to help you.
I thought I was the psychic.
But I come bearing gifts.
I figured your slender toes must get a little chilly down here on the block.
They do.
Thank you.
All right, what can I do for you?
Is that big Brian Sampson on the slab?
Handsome dude got a big ol'hole in his pec.
What's the first thing that pops into your head when I say Sampson?
A vacuum you can use in space.
Thank you.
What can you tell me?
Even though the bullet was not found, in my opinion, it likely came from a winchester 70 rifle.
Get out of this death igloo.
You can tell that just by looking at the hole?
Correct you are, my gelled friend.
Allow me to demonstrate.
Of course, watermelon.
- Perfect substitute for the human head.
- Uncanny.
Porterhouse simulates the human thigh.
The maple wood simulates oak wood.
This is all academic unless we can find the murder weapon.
Believe me, you've helped more than you could possibly know.
Worces ter.
- The sauce?
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Westchester.
- The county?
Counties can't kill people, Jules.
Win.
Win?
- Chester!
- Yes!
- 69 - 70.
Jessica Martino owns a winchester 70.
That is a very good link to the murder of Brian Sampson.
Let's pay miss Martino a little visit, shall we?
I'll call Gus, tell to stay away from Jessica.
- What's up.
- Stay away from Jessica.
You hooked up with her?
What does that mean?
No, she might be the murderer.
What?
- Make sure you don't go near her.
- Don't worry.
Ruby's fine.
She had to clear her head, so she and Derek went paragliding.
- You know, that's how they cope.
- Of course it is.
This was a great idea, Derek.
Things have just been so out of control this week.
I needed something to take my mind off of Stu.
No problem.
We're gonna glide down the valley and then hike back up.
I'm just gonna put our coordinates in so we take the shortest path.
Who do you know in Lone Pine?
You know, that's the area that I told Stu about.
How did It was you.
There's no way.
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
That was Jules.
They found the rifle in Jessica's apartment.
- They're booking Jessica now.
- Man, she was crazy.
Glad we found out now before you hooked up.
When was I ever gonna hook up with Jessica?
Shawn, please, you know honey was fly.
She's a murderer, Gus.
Plus, it was creepy.
She stalks Brian, she dates Derek.
- She was hot.
- I know.
- With legs I could've climbed.
- What?
I don't know if it means anything, but you guys would make a great couple.
Maybe I should give you my key to her apartment.
Which is ironic because Derek used to be a big game hunter back when he was dating Jessica.
We're a tight-knit group.
We look out for our own.
Isn't that right, guys?
- What?
- Ruby's in danger.
- I'll explain on the way.
- I just put my car in the shop.
Hold on tight.
I can't even process this, Derek.
Stu was our friend.
How could you kill him?
Friend?
Stu didn't understand the meaning of true friendship.
True friends stand behind one another.
- See, Stu and I had a pact.
- All right.
I would make Brian pay for what he did and then I was gonna let Stu cash in on the insurance policy.
- Right.
- And I held up my end.
But Stu decided to get a conscience.
Why don't Why don't you and I just make a pact right now?
A pact that neither of us is gonna kill me.
You have no idea the adrenaline rush you get when you track down and kill a man.
It's like lightning running down your spine.
None of this stuff compares.
I always sensed that you were the strongest of the group.
And I envied Jessica that she got to be with you.
You know that?
Please don't insult my intelligence.
Fine, but I had to try.
You're a douche bag, and quite frankly, as dumb as a wildebeest.
- Sorry it had to end this way.
- No, Derek!
Please, no!
- Step away from my lady.
- Please!
Don't move.
One step and she's gone.
It's all about taking it to the next level.
Isn't that right, D?
I can see everything.
You killed Brian Sampson because he ruined Stu.
Then you proudly told Stu you did it.
But instead of thanking you, he totally freaked out.
Because he wasn't crazy.
You knew it was only a matter of time before he went to the authorities.
So you used your key to get into Jessica's place to take back the rifle you gave her from your big game hunting days.
- You done?
- Yeah.
Finally, you tracked down your buddy like a desert fox, and killed him, making it look like a suicide.
Thus, pinning the murder of Brian Sampson on Stu.
Freeze!
SBPD!
You're not going anywhere.
- I got him, Shawn.
- Get off me.
- Save me!
- Hang on tight.
- Come on.
- Don't let go.
We'll see you at the bottom.
- He's going south.
Cover all clearings.
- Back up, move south to open field.
- He's not even hooked in.
- Don't worry, when Gus is scared, - he can cling like a drowning cat.
- Don't let me die, Shawn!
- There!
- Thank you, lord.
Dude, that was amazing!
You manhandled a killer and took him to the ground.
It was nothing.
A man protects his lady.
You're so brave.
I'm your rock.
I'm your island.
- I know.
- How do you get this damn thing off?
Here let me help you.
You untwist this.
You all right?
- What really happened?
- I squeezed him so tight, - he passed out by accident.
- Nice.
And my helmet smashed into his chin.
Okay, we're gonna say that you muscled up his back and then you put him in a sleeper hold.
Sounds good.
Next level's gonna be dope.
Ruby's home safe and sound.
There he is.
I gotta say, that was awfully boyfriend-y of you, Jumping out there risking death like that to save Ruby.
She is lucky to have you, dude.
And I mean just you, all you, nothing but the you.
You know.
We're gonna take a breather for a while.
- We are?
- Yeah.
I mean, as you know our relationship started off a lot more action-packed and exciting than most.
You mean, with people disappearing, dying, and being arrested?
Yeah, and a lot of heavy foods.
So you two have decided to take a step back and evaluate if the attraction is real?
And then when everything gets back to normal, if the feelings are still there, we'll start seeing each other again.
He's all grown up.
Making grown-up decisions.
- It was her idea, wasn't it?
- Of course it was.
I was begging.
I did some soul searching too.
What if we had to go on the lam like Stu, and we ended up in the sierras or someplace way far away from civilization, with no cell phones, and no water, it was just us, and we're lost never to be heard from again?
- That would suck.
- It sure would.
So then I started thinking, if that's us Death and starvation are imminent How long would you want me to wait before I ate you?
I won't dignify that with an answer.
It's a perfectly reasonable question.
- It's like having a living will.
- No one plans for that.
Tell Gus it's normal for friends to discuss when they'd like to be eaten in the event of a tragic alive-esque scenario?
Believe it or not, I'm with Spencer on this one.
I would eat the three of you in the following order: O'Hara, Guster, then Spencer.
I've also made a list of whose organs I'd prefer if I need a transplant.
And I've planned for the contingency where I'm the last man on earth and I need to choose one person from the department with whom to procreate.
Don't worry.
None of you made the list.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Well, this is it.
I guess it is.
Stay in California with me.
Scott, no, we talked about this.
I have two years left of college, the police academy in Miami, and you know long-distance relationships, they never work.
And Florida and California, I mean, we couldn't be further apart.
Yeah, I know, but this trip out here together, it's made me want to throw caution to the wind, you know?
- And you You like California, right?
- I do.
It's nice, and Maybe someday, but I don't know, the idea of a clean break, it just makes so much sense.
I know.
I have an idea.
How about in ten years, we meet right back here, same time, 4:00.
And if we're both married, great.
We'll talk about our kids, but if we're both single, we'll go for coffee, see where it goes.
Both practical and hugely romantic.
How do you always do that?
All right.
There's only one problem.
Ten years is too long.
- How about eight?
- How about seven?
See you then.
I should just leave, right?
No, a couple minutes.
I'll stay.
No, you're right.
You are absolutely right.
I really do appreciate you being my sounding board through all of this.
I want you to listen to me, O'Hara.
And believe this, because I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
All romance ends in despair Or death, but mostly despair.
Gut-wrenching despair.
I hate to say this, but I'm happy that this happened, because now you know, and it's gonna make you a better cop to realize that all people are essentially just out there to destroy any chance of happiness you would ever have.
I feel a hug coming on.
Okay, there you go.
You know what?
You're right.
I am not going to sit here and wonder why he didn't show up.
I barely remembered the date.
How could he?
I am gonna get back to work.
I have important things to do.
So your friend appears to have fallen off the face of the earth?
I haven't digging anything yet, so I need you to look through every single file that I've tagged here.
We have a missing persons case Something I should know about?
It's a A personal matter?
First of all, I'm sure you know the use of these files for anything other than police business is illegal, and you have a serious backlog of real cases.
I know.
I'm I just lost my head for a second.
- I'm sorry.
- I don't mean to sound like a hard-ass.
- No.
I didn't get that.
- I did.
- I was trying to sound like a hard-ass.
- Mission accomplished.
Go back to work, O'Hara.
I'm sorry your boyfriend didn't show.
Can I offer you a piece of general advice about men?
They often don't show.
Scott was different.
- You want us to find someone for you?
- No, not us.
- You.
- Why not Shawn?
It's a tricky situation.
See, it's somebody that I used to know.
A boyfriend Well, a former boyfriend, but seeing everything that's happened, it would be like opening a wound - You know what I mean.
- I will handle this in stealth mode.
You might not know this, but I'm known as "the vault of secrets".
- No, I didn't know that.
- Shawn will never find out.
- What are you doing?
- Working on a case for Juliet, a random missing persons case.
She doesn't want me to bother you.
What?
Jules needs help, I'm in.
You know that.
But no She said no Well, said no.
I'd rather do it solo.
Oh, my God.
Are you in the vault of secrets right now?
You are.
- It's settled.
I'm helping.
- You are not helping.
Period.
Suck it.
Fine.
I guess I'll just find Scott Seaver by myself, solo.
You don't know how to do it solo.
That's my department.
- Sounds like a challenge.
- It's not a challenge.
- Challenge accepted.
- Will you get out of here?
- What are you doing here?
- I have a meeting with someone.
- And you?
- I solved Juliet's case.
- You did not.
- Yes, I did.
- Let me be the one to break it to her.
- Absolutely not.
- She hired me.
- Gus, it was a tricky find.
I want all the glory for solving Jules' case.
Besides, I am the one that does this.
- Wouldn't it be weird if you did it?
- It's weird when anyone does it.
It looks pretty sweet when Simon Baker does it.
- Simon Baker doesn't do it.
- He doesn't?
At least we have that.
Gus let me in on your little missing persons case.
- You what?
- Your random missing persons case, - the person you've never met before.
- I've got some good news/bad news on this Scott Seaver fellow.
- Bad news is he's dead.
- What?
Doornail.
That's why you had such a hard time finding him.
Oh, my God.
Man, she really takes these cases seriously.
It was her boyfriend.
Her college boyfriend.
What?
You said she never even met this guy.
- I lied.
What difference does it make?
- Why?
What could possibly be the good news coming after that?
I was gonna say the good news is we have a case, because I'm pretty sure he was murdered.
Psych 412 "A Very Juliet Episode" Timing: Psych Team - What are you doing here so early?
- I'm working the Scott Seaver case.
Juliet needs closure.
- We did a terrible thing.
- No, you did a terrible thing.
Found it!
- You called your dad in?
- I found the guy in the first place.
- What?
- With my help.
You sat here and ate munchos while I called in Sacramento.
- I was on the missing persons website.
- The band missing persons.
Check out this report I was able to find.
- I found that too.
- That is the worst murder cover-up.
Scott Seaver was pronounced dead 4 1/2 years ago, right?
Car totaled on a lonely stretch of highway, in the California desert, windows down.
- So?
- So it was 42 degrees that night.
More importantly, cars don't suddenly blow up on their own.
They certainly don't blow up in a way so there's no trace of anything.
- So what's next?
- So glad you asked, because the thing is I managed to get onto a website that I probably shouldn't be on.
Don't tell me you're going all Pete Townsend on me.
I finally busted out my treasury department password.
What?
You don't have a treasury department password.
No, but agent Lars Ewing did, and he was really lousy at using his other hand to cover his typing hand.
- Why my computer?
- 'Cause it's nice.
We just got a hit on the name Scott Seaver.
- Is it local?
- Fairly.
Are you sure it's cool for us to be in the chief's office?
Of course, it is.
I practically run this place.
Hit the deck!
It's the biscuit lady.
We're good.
I owe her 80 cents.
I kind of made out with her at the department picnic.
Here are my findings.
Turns out Juliet's boyfriend was working for a company - owned by the infamous J.T. Waring.
- Who?
- Come on.
She wrote the Harry Potters.
- That's J.K. Rowling.
J.T. Waring is a Los Angeles mobster.
Went down for racketeering few years ago.
- What's racketeering?
- Nobody knows.
Get down!
- That was a dude.
- That must have been some crazy picnic.
So this building was Waring's legitimate front.
I think this Seaver guy got in over his head and someone took him down hard.
One of us is gonna have to grill Juliet on her dead boyfriend.
- I nominate you.
- Wait.
We're gonna interrogate her now?
Hasn't she been through enough already?
We'll all do it together very delicately.
We were thinking collectively, that it might be nice if you told us a little more about Scott.
Especially his darkest tendencies, priors, fetishes.
- Gus, what are you doing?
- I'm a sympathetic crier.
I am not crying.
Can't you just give me a little time to get my thoughts together?
- That was your fault.
- Fetishes?
Tell eye faucets here.
- For God sakes, man.
- No, I'm fine.
I'm so sorry.
I don't usually do horrible things to people that I care about.
I don't.
Shawn, it's okay.
It was actually really nice of you to ask about him.
He was a wonderful, wonderful guy.
Yeah, he sounds like it.
I was crazy about him.
My girlfriends said it was because he was so tall.
I love tall guys.
But for me, it was It was his heart and his soul, his athleticism.
- Let me guess he played football.
- Tight end.
Sometimes we tend to romanticize the past.
I'm sure you know that.
No, not with Scott.
He was just so secure and genuine Optimistic and youthful.
He had this rare figurine collection.
Dumbo.
I loved dumbo when I was a kid, and he gave me one when I turned 18, broke up a set.
It was hugely valuable as a set, and he gave it to me, 'cause it meant something to me when I was 18.
You like tall men and fat animals.
Yes, I do.
He had this connection through his late grandfather's office with the mayor, and he actually got us Super Bowl tickets.
- 35 yard line.
- Super Bowl?
It was the most exciting night of my life.
Get out of here!
You and your black friend, get out of here!
I actually feel better.
That makes me so happy.
Come here, 'cause we talked it out.
God, it feels so happy.
- Should we keep walking?
- Sure.
The county sheriff was no help at all, and the accident scene where Scott crashed his car?
It's now a mini-mall.
How nobody could have taken one single photograph, it just doesn't make any sense.
These guys are a bunch of jackasses.
Dad, thanks for trying, and bonus points for using the word "jackass" in another conversation unironically.
You've been on the phone?
So you haven't heard anything I said.
The complaining?
No, I heard.
We've been going in the wrong direction for about two hours now.
I know that look.
What are you on to?
Dumbo figurines.
Turns out, those figurines are extremely rare, maybe three complete sets in the world.
Did a little search on eBay.
Someone is selling the exact set, minus the piece that Scott gave to Jules.
This is the apartment of this person?
I'll call Lassie.
No, that'll take too long.
Besides, I have no idea whose jurisdiction we're in.
Here's the thing.
I think Scott was murdered, robbed.
The killer thinks the coast is clear.
He's finally selling off his belongings.
- All we have to do is find the seller.
- We just did!
You knocked on the door of a murderer, and all you can say is "ooh"?
I should have thought about it before I said it out loud, but I wanted a fun reveal for you.
Got some good news and some bad news.
Remember I told you that Scott Seaver guy was dead?
- Shawn, not now.
- Well, here's the good news.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it!
That's probably enough of that.
I can't believe I'm I'm seeing you.
There's so much I want to tell you.
What's the bad news?
There is no bad news.
- Actually, there is.
- This is Daniel Wayne.
He's a federal marshal.
These are the two who found Mr. Seaver.
- You did this?
- Yes, we did, but don't worry.
There's no need for a reward.
That's good, because we generally don't give out rewards for exposing a key witness right out of witness protection.
And after college, I landed a job as an imports appraiser for a company in Los Angeles, but it wasn't till later I found out that one of the company's silent partners was J.T. Waring.
Who was a well-known figure in organized crime circles down there.
- You were working for a criminal?
- I didn't know.
Waring was using it as a front for a number of criminal activities without the knowledge of his employees, so we raided his business, and we took him into custody.
And that's when I found out what was going on.
Waring killed a federal agent during the raid.
Mr. Seaver's testimony placed him in the room with the dead agent, effectively securing his life sentence.
Mr. Seaver here's a hero.
I'm sure any of us would have done the same in his place.
No.
Remember when you saw that accident and then you pretended to be blind?
That's different.
Our movie was in 8 minutes.
Why would you bring that up?
You were willing to risk your life to put a dangerous man behind bars?
Mr. Seaver is a great American.
Who worked for a criminal.
And now his life may be in grave danger.
Mr. Waring is very well-connected, even behind bars.
These people hold grudges, and they pay for them in blood.
Fortunately, I have my team preparing a new identity for Mr. Seaver.
I'm not going.
My life is here.
Not only did you show up at the train station, but when I wasn't there, You searched high and low for me.
I appreciate everything that you people have done for me, but you got to understand, witness protection, it might as well be prison.
I never felt comfortable, and I never felt safe.
I vote he goes back.
You will never be safe out of protection.
Once they make you, you're gone.
Waring is serving three life sentences.
I'm not the biggest piece of the puzzle here.
The bottom line is I'm out, I'm safe, and I don't care.
What, all of a sudden, this is my fault?
What about Gus?
I didn't have a chance to cook for anybody in protection.
When a date asks, "tell me about you" you have to answer from a government-issued note card.
When you were in the program, did you ever order spaghetti marinara and get egg noodles and ketchup instead?
- What do you mean?
- It's from Goodfellas.
Never mind.
I get it.
No, I don't.
Look at this spice rack.
All the seals unbroken.
Yeah, I don't really get a chance to cook for anyone, either.
Cop hours.
Finally regretting that choice not to attend clown college?
How do we do this?
I guess we start from seven years ago and move on from there, - and leave out all the boring parts.
- What if there are no boring parts?
Then this is going to be a very long conversation.
- What's that?
- I am so sorry, but I'm gonna have to tell you to move away from the window.
Male about 5'8".
I chased him off.
I don't know how he slipped past me.
You stay put.
I got back-up on the way.
Wait.
This isn't a date?
You're protecting me?
Look, we need to get him back into protection, okay?
I got a guy who can disappear with him.
Waring's men are out there.
Agent Wayne, you know as well as anyone that Mr. Seaver is a private citizen, and he isn't legally compelled to do any such thing.
We are doing everything we can to ensure his safety.
Posting one cop outside her exposed apartment while she plays grab-ass inside?
Who was in your apartment?
The truth of the matter is, we may have overreacted last night.
We never actually saw the assailant, or the alleged assailant.
What time are we talking, before or after Conan?
A person was seen, we chased him off.
- We can't be sure he came after Scott.
- Listen, girl, I don't care.
Tommy Lee Jones!
- What?
- Fugitive.
You're missing some of the country Shake it off.
- Let's try it again.
I'll be Harrison.
- You know, I used to have some respect, and you have single-handedly let this guy destroy my career.
I get it, agent Wayne.
You're very important.
But why don't you let me handle my people when you're in this building?
All right, everybody relax.
I admit that some of this is my fault.
- Much of it.
- All.
But we recognize the trouble that we have caused.
I have a plan, and I will fix it.
This is your fix, Shawn?
The man is a convicted murderer.
He will kill us.
Don't be the "it" in "wait for it"!
This is gonna work great.
Hello, Mr. Waring.
My name is Shawn Spencer, well-known psychic detective, and this is my associate, Burton Guster.
Now you wanna use my real name?
We'd like to ask you a question about one Scott Seaver.
You mean now that he's out of witness protection?
- You knew that?
- You just confirmed it for me.
I can't catch a break this week, can I?
What do you want?
We were hoping we could come here and appeal to you so that nothing happens to him.
Scott Seaver is the reason I'm in here.
Scott Seaver worked for you for two years.
- He had no beef with you.
- Why are you talking in an accent?
- I'm speaking this man's language.
- The man's language is English, Shawn.
What's your point?
I have a point.
It's this: Scott Seaver is a decent guy, trying to live his life in a decent way, and I am sensing that you are also a decent man.
Perhaps it will ease your conscience a bit to let him be.
You sense I'm a decent man?
Plus, you're serving three consecutive life sentences, so Scott's testimony that put you in the room with the body doesn't really mean much not in the grand scheme of things.
Look, Mr. Spencer.
Sometimes things happen without my knowledge.
People on the outside want to do things for me, whether I ask them to or not.
I have that kind of effect on people.
Course, they do.
You're super cool.
My question is: could you ask those people to not do those things to Scott?
Perhaps.
What's in it for me?
How about I bake you a cake that's extra high in iron?
I have a far less ridiculous counter-proposal for you.
If you are a psychic, how about you prove something for me?
What's that?
Stop it.
That I didn't kill that man.
Seriously, Shawn, of course he's gonna say he's not guilty.
All cons are innocent.
Let's just hear him out.
The dead marshal at the raid, agent Renfro He was dead when I found him.
I was at the wrong place at wrong time, and the murder got pinned on me.
My God, he's convincing.
Convincing?
He's a criminal.
Yes, but he has a great head, and a real presence.
There's something very Billy Zane-Ian about him.
You and Billy Zane are the only ones who use that term.
The man is playing you.
He's a murderer, a liar, and the lowest form of trash.
You know these things don't turn off, right?
- Do you understand about honor?
- Of course I do.
I have a bootleg copy of Saving private Ryan.
It's the first and last thing my father taught me.
Without honor, there is nothing.
Now, I don't mind serving the time for a crime I may have committed, but I don't kill people, and I can't have my children think I do.
- I believe you.
Yes, I do.
- You do not.
Oh, my Gosh.
Then vindicate me, and Mr. Seaver will be safe, but not until my name is cleared.
Deal?
Don't do it.
Don't do it, Shawn.
Don't, don't.
Deal.
I just want you to know that you have my blessing.
For what?
To consummate your relationship with Scott.
I just meant that Should this thing work out This guy's okay in my book.
Look, I don't get to be a confidante all that often Ever, for anybody, 'cause people don't really talk to me.
So I wanted to give this careful consideration, and, after a thorough background check and an unauthorized blood test, I get what you see in this guy.
What?
You don't seem so sure.
I showed up for a cup of coffee, and now he thinks I combed the state for him.
I mean, I would think I was a little creepy.
It's just a lot to take.
You know what I feel like?
I feel like that scene in Grease.
After the bonfire, when Sandy's sprung on Danny when he least expects it.
What?
I can't see movies too?
That is spot on, with scary precision.
Here's the thing, O'Hara.
You haven't seen this guy in, like, seven years.
You're both entirely different people.
The only way you're gonna know anything is if you get to know each other again.
Everything else is pure speculation.
It's like wondering what would have happened if Kenickie had driven at thunder road.
- Are we still on Grease?
- We never weren't.
You didn't have to break the window.
What was I gonna do, climb over the barbed wire fence?
I'm just saying, the door's been sitting here untouched.
- There's decay.
- Decay?
- This isn't planet of the apes, Gus.
- This was a very fortified building.
Waring was big on security, so you're both right.
You guys always disagree?
- Always.
- Not always.
- It's weird being in here now.
- So this was Waring's legitimate cover.
You weren't aware of any improprieties going on whatsoever?
- Do you doubt me, Shawn?
- No.
Maybe a little.
I'm an appraiser, not a smuggler.
Plus, I turned my boss in.
I was the one who could place Waring in the room with the body.
- Which room?
- Waring's office.
Right over there.
This must be where it happened.
- Get down.
Be the body.
- I'm not laying on a floor.
- Come on, man, I'm onto something.
- This is a $260 shirt.
- You got that for 18 bucks.
- List price, Shawn.
- You cannot quote list price.
- There's blood on the floor.
That's not blood.
That's clearly crime scene oil.
- I've never heard of crime scene oil.
- They stopped using it in the 70s.
F.D.R. was like, "not in my house".
- That makes no sense.
- Whose dad is a cop?
Why's he laying in the pool of blood?
He was being the body.
He was laying in the wrong direction anyway.
No, Scott, I'm a psychic, and I'm sensing that the body was turned in the other direction.
I remember it.
His head was over there.
I came in through the back door, saw Waring standing over with a gun, and then he ran out the front door.
Let me ask you something.
Why did they need you?
Couldn't they have convicted him with the bullet?
The bullet went right through the guy.
And they never found it.
Didn't you read the trial transcript?
Yeah, Gus, that was right at the top of my "to don't" list.
Excuse me.
You should stop doubting this guy.
I don't know.
Nothing he says holds any water.
Everything you've said in the last 2 days has been wrong.
That's false.
I was right about Mr. T in The blues brothers.
I'm talking about the case.
All right, fine.
Let's just say, for argument's sake, that you're right.
The body was this way, and the head was down there.
That would mean The bullet went right through the guy.
I think I know where the bullet went.
- You know those are backwards?
- What?
That makes all the difference in the world.
- You're looking too low, Shawn.
- No, I'm not.
That window was 20 feet off the ground.
The coroner's report said that the exit and entry wounds were the same height.
That means the bullet traveled relatively straight.
Sometimes I have to help my partner with the police aspect.
- But you're not compensating.
- I most certainly am.
But you're looking at the forest like it was five years ago.
Yeah, trees grow.
Exactly.
Holy Is that what I think it is?
Shimmy up a little higher.
- Stop worrying about your fingernails.
- This thing is covered with sap and I have very sensitive cuticles, and if you're so great, why don't you come up here and do it?
Gentlemen, I think we may have just found ourselves a bullet.
Guy with a gun!
We need to go!
- You're supposed to bring me!
- Jump!
- It's too high!
- It's not that high!
They want Scott, not you!
- This better be good, Mr. Spencer.
- It'll be good, chief.
Please.
There is a bullet in this tree.
It's in a tiny hole.
You cannot see it, but my senses have led us here.
We can see it.
You need a ladder or a psychic third eye to see it from there.
Lodged deep in the trunk is the bullet that killed agent Xavier Renfro.
That's not his name.
- We see the hole.
- No, Jules, you'd need binoculars to see it from that vantage point.
Someone must have gotten here before us.
- Who?
- The real killer.
You've reached a new level of recklessness, and, unfortunately, it's become necessary to issue you both formal reprimands.
On what grounds?
How about misuse of a federal database?
Informing a convicted criminal that his accuser is out of protection, trespassing, - assisting an incarcerated murderer.
- These are crimes?
Is this North Korea?
They all are, except the last, which is just poor judgment.
- Did agent Wayne put you up to this?
- He wanted charges brought against you.
I cannot believe that you are bowing down to this man.
Can someone give me a reason why he is so obsessed with this silly little case?
Because the agent who died was his partner.
You should just stop talking until this streak blows over.
May I speak with agent Wayne?
Agent Wayne is escorting a witness to a handler to go back into protection.
- Not Scott.
- Yeah.
He agreed to go back in.
Getting shot at in the forest was a real eye-opener.
And, besides, you just missed him.
Mr. Spencer, now.
Holy crap.
It was him.
It was Wayne!
He's the one that dug the bullet out.
Honestly, you are scraping - the bottom of the barrel now.
- You're not listening.
He was there the night of the shooting.
He was.
Why do you think he's so passionate?
That is not why he was so passionate!
Scott Seaver did not witness a murder.
He witnessed a cover-up.
Somebody might want to follow me!
What the hell do you think you're doing, Spencer?
- I'll have you arrested.
- That's funny.
I was about to say you the same thing.
On what grounds?
Let's see here murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, unlawful carving of a spruce tree.
What?
You're the one that dug the bullet out.
The one that killed your partner, the one that came from your gun.
It was you.
You did it.
Wait a second.
It was an accident, wasn't it?
You saw a gun, and you saw a figure, and you thought it was Waring.
Then Waring came in, saw the body on the ground, pulled his gun.
And that's when Scott came in, he found Waring standing over the body, and then saw Waring flee the scene.
When you got to the room, you realized your horrible mistake.
Your partner laying lifeless on the ground, the only one that could have shot him was you.
You repositioned the body, made it look like Waring had shot him, and then you pinned the whole thing on Waring.
Murder conviction was a lock, followed by a sentence which Waring deserved, but always eluded, because of his cool demeanor and Billy Zane-Ian qualities.
Let's be honest, that man has a presence.
But perhaps most importantly, it meant your partner agent Renfro didn't die in vain.
I really wish you hadn't said that.
Sorry, Wayne.
No take backs.
You know, getting rid of him, that was gonna be easy.
You, not so much.
Just let it go, man.
You're clearly outnumbered.
Really?
Guess that evens things up a bit.
You think so?
Oh, boy.
You're gonna hide behind your little gun, huh?
Come on.
Put that thing down.
Take me on mano a mano, huh?
Just two dudes going at it.
Two unevenly-matched dudes?
Where am I?
You gonna be able to bend those things?
Can you bend those bullets?
I always hate when they make that speech.
Who's gonna drop their, you know, gun I'm not proud of that.
Scott Seaver was a convenient witness, right place, wrong time!
Putting him in witness protection would ensure that there were no questions left behind!
Dude, did you see what I just did?
You're not gonna kill me.
You're not a cold-blooded murderer.
- Otherwise you would have killed Scott.
- The only difference is, I didn't have to kill him.
- Federal agent, you idiot.
- Not anymore.
So what happened?
Gave him the old mano a mano speech.
- Did it work?
- Not even sort of.
Then what?
- Had to knock him out, Gus.
- I thought Scott knocked him out.
I've heard it both ways.
I have a confession to make.
I didn't come looking for you last week.
Shawn did, all on his own.
I know.
You do?
I guess I was kind of hoping it was you.
I would have If I thought you were really in trouble.
Where does this leave us?
I'm not sure.
Seeing you again changed so much in my life.
Me too.
But I don't even know what my life is right now.
Right now.
I mean, I lost five years of it.
I guess, someday, I might, but The thing is I have an idea.
How about, in three years, we meet right back here?
Same time.
See you.
One problem.
Three years is too long.
- How about two?
- How about one?
See you then.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
This is humiliating, Dad.
Not as humiliating as being the parent of the only child sent home from his school with lice.
That shampoo smells like urinal cakes.
Smelling like a men's room is a small price to pay for ridding your scalp of parasites.
- How did I get lice, anyways?
- You tell me.
You come in contact with anything out of ordinary lately?
No, unless you count that squirrel with the foamy mouth I've been playing with.
It's a good thing they sent you home.
All it takes is one unclean child to start a full-blown outbreak.
What's an outbreak?
It's when an illness is passed from person to person until it becomes widespread.
How's it passed?
One could come in contact with a sick person or maybe even something they've touched.
- Like a comb?
- Exactly, like a comb.
Wait.
Why did you say comb?
Because I used yours this morning.
Oh, my God Damn it.
I don't know what smells worse, that breakfast burrito or those nacho cheese cornnuts you used to eat.
Let's do a smell test.
Here, close your eyes.
- What's going on with you?
- Whatever do you mean?
Why are you eating stinky food and dressed like you're going tailgating?
I'll tell you exactly why.
Because I can.
Okay, I get it.
Now that you're single, you're doing the things Abigail wouldn't let you do - while you were dating.
- You nailed it.
Which is why I'm tivoing Blame it on Rio as we speak.
And dude - My favorite ringer is back.
- Please tell me it's not.
- My piece of art is back on the wall.
- It's not art.
It's a poster of a hot blonde laying on a Corvette that says "hauling ass".
If it's not art, why did I insure it for $1/2 million?
- Because you're an idiot.
- Guys?
What's up?
- Why does it smell like old diaper?
- Beats me.
What's up with you?
I'm actually meeting this guy for coffee.
You mean, like a date?
- I guess you could call it that.
- What if we didn't?
It's with Richard.
From forensics.
We know Richard from forensics.
He's the guy with the big You know that giant, giant, set of Ears?
Oh, no.
I've never noticed his ears.
You know me, Mr. Non-judgmental.
- He also goes by Mr. Dobalina.
- Mr. Bob Dobalina.
I'm actually running late.
So maybe I'll see you guys later.
Good luck!
- Jealous much?
- Of who?
Richard?
The man looks like a cab with its doors open.
Please, that's why you were all "what do you mean, like a date"?
All right, first of all, you have to stop using the "I'm not falling for no banana in my tailpipe" voice every time you imitate a white person.
Secondly, I'm a grown man, I am confident, and I can admit that, yes, I'm a little jealous.
Why don't you do something about it?
She doesn't sound too keen on the guy.
- You're not getting any younger.
- Yes, but my hair is getting thicker.
And I have seeds to sow.
Don't worry, guy-who-uses-words-like-keen.
There is plenty of time for me and Jules.
All right.
What is this?
Nice to meet you guys.
I'm Donny Lieberman.
Did you have a few cocktails for breakfast there, Donny?
Oh, no.
Do I reek?
I went out last night, got kinda wasted.
You smell like tequila.
Which is still preferable to those cornnuts.
That's just a lie.
You guys gotta help me.
Because I messed up.
I mean, I really, really messed up.
It's not your fault.
Oh, good.
How do you know?
I don't.
But when people say that in movies, things seemed to get fixed almost magically.
Here's the deal.
I work for a courier service that specializes in the transport of biomedical materials.
And yesterday I was told to pick up a cooler from a lab called Genutech, take it back to my hotel by the airport, then fly to CDC headquarters in Atlanta this morning.
But like an idiot, I went out.
And when I woke up this morning, the cooler was gone.
And I have no idea what I did with it, because I was so drunk, the entire night's a blur.
It's not your fault.
- What exactly was in the cooler?
- Kidney?
The disembodied soul of Marsellus Wallace?
Okay, please know that I would have never gone out had I known at the time what was inside the cooler.
What was in the cooler?
The Thornburg virus.
The Thornburg virus?
What does this have to do with Richard Chamberlain?
That's the thorn birds.
Thornburg is an extremely rare virus that usually targets people in Africa Which makes it racist, by the way.
Let me get this straight.
You hit the town.
You got sloppy drunk.
Passed out.
Woke up without a virus?
Isn't it usually the other way around?
Normally I would notify the police or the CDC in a situation like this.
But I was just thinking that maybe if we find it first, then no one has to be the wiser.
Is there anything else that's missing?
Yes, my antique gold watch given to me by my father.
If someone were to open this cooler, what would happen, exactly?
If someone went so far as to touch the contents of the vial, that That would not be good.
How not good are we talking?
Thornburg moves pretty quickly once you have it, you know?
And there's a host of symptoms.
There's headaches, weakness, bleeding Sometimes even from the eyes.
Excuse me, miss.
Miss?
Psych 413 "Death is in the Air" Timing: Psych Team We should come back here and hang out with our skateboards.
You know that's right.
I have never seen the two of you arrive so fast at a police scene.
You've never seen us called to one with a grape slushie machine either.
The woman who died had blood dripping from her eye?
Yeah, it's really freaky.
She's right there.
There's no I.D. on the body yet.
Probably another junkie.
Hold up, hold up.
I'm getting something.
Granted, this could be some kind of Pavlovian brain freeze caused by the slushie machine but No, this is real.
Drugs did not kill that woman.
It was the thorn birds virus.
- Do you mean Thornburg?
- What he said.
I studied that in school.
Has there ever been a case in the U.S.?
No, there's not enough black people.
There's never been a case.
Has anyone touched that body?
Not yet.
Still waiting for the coroner.
I strongly suggest no one go near it unless they're wearing one of those big cumbersome stay puft protective suits.
- Hazmat?
- Please don't make up words.
I'm not about to create mass hysteria just because you saw Outbreak this weekend.
Dude, I saw that movie once, like, ten years ago.
I missed the first 23 minutes altogether.
He has an irrational fear of Patrick Dempsey.
It's very rational.
It's rational.
Either of you watch Grey's Anatomy?
- The man is completely terrifying.
- You're just jealous of his hair.
- Well, there's that.
- There's only that.
Trust me, Lassie, I'm getting a very clear signal on this.
Thornburg virus.
There is no way.
Right, O'Hara?
Step away from that body.
That's an order.
I don't want to take the chance that he's wrong.
I'm gonna call the CDC.
You were right to raise the possibility, even if it turns out that wasn't Thornburg that got her.
I don't think we're gonna get that lucky.
Donny!
Does this woman look familiar to you?
- Is she dead?
- As a bag of rocks.
It's dumb as a bag of rocks.
Guess what she was wearing on her wrist?
- Don't know.
- Your watch.
So I killed her?
Oh, god.
The tequila.
- It turned me into Ted Bundy.
- No, Donny.
You're not ted bundy.
You didn't kill her.
Not directly.
There was blood dripping from her eye.
- She had Thornburg?
- It's a possibility.
If she had your watch, she may also have had your cooler.
Donny, breathe.
Stop.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
In, out.
Here, chew this gum.
It's delicious.
- Explosion of flavor.
- Delicious.
Now listen.
If we're gonna retrieve your cooler, we have to figure out who this woman is.
Are you sure you've never seen her before?
- I don't know.
- Concentrate, man!
We were drinking together last night.
Great.
What else?
We were eating.
Chicken Katsu.
Yummy, apricot sauce?
- Do you remember where you were?
- No, but The place had a bunch of Tiki torches!
Are you sure this is the place?
I'm absolutely positive, Donny.
My psychic senses are never off.
And this is the bar in your hotel.
I'm never drinking again.
There he is.
There's the guy.
- I have something of yours.
- You do?
- Yeah, here it is.
- Leave it!
You remember wearing this thing?
You were like, "check me out.
I'm rainbow man".
You're a madman.
- Let me buy you a drink.
- I'll have a club soda with three pineapple wedges.
And if you can get the hippy hippy shake going, flip a few glasses and introduce me to Elizabeth Shue, there's an extra fiver in it for you.
We're actually here to help rainbow man fill in the blanks from last night.
He's having a hard time remembering.
I'll bet.
He and this smokin' brunette must've had 20 tequila shots.
You wouldn't happen to remember her name, would you?
- I believe her name was Ginger.
- Ginger.
- Do you know where they went by chance?
- Don't worry.
I do.
I can't believe it.
This is crazy.
So I took her back to my room?
I never do that.
Is it possible I have game?
Apparently you did last night.
She was quite taken with you.
- Really?
- No, she was a prostitute.
Come on.
Think about it.
You met her in a hotel bar.
Plus, her name is Ginger.
Throughout history there's only two Gingers that weren't prostitutes: Ginger Rogers and Ginger from Gilligan's Island.
I still have my suspicions about the latter.
In fact, I've made my decision.
She was a filthy pirate hooker.
You know that's right.
Yeah, well, at least I scored, right?
Donny, your friend Ginger targeted you, okay?
That means her plan was to get you sloppy drunk, wait till you pass out, and rob you blind.
Yeah, but why would she take the cooler?
Maybe she thought it contained something valuable.
The stuff I transfer is really valuable.
That's probably right.
That's me.
I cannot wait till you find a new girlfriend.
Shawn, you were totally right.
- About what, Atlantis?
- No!
About the girl.
She had Thornburg.
We can't be 100% sure, but all of her symptoms are consistent.
CDC's on it's way.
And her name was Jennifer Cotsitas.
Let me guess.
She's a prostitute who went by the name "Ginger".
You nailed it.
It's really important that I get this girl's address.
I Need to go by there.
That's where I'm calling you from.
And Shawn, she must be a great hooker.
This place is sweet.
You kidding?
Listen to me, Jules.
If you see anything that even resembles a cooler, don't go near it, okay?
Don't worry.
We have combed this place head to toe and there's absolutely nothing like that here.
But get this, in one of her drawers, we found $10,000 in cash in a fresh envelope.
Hold on a second.
- You're not missing ten grand?
- Are you kidding?
I can't be missing something I never had.
Somebody hired her to steal the cooler.
- I'm back.
- And one more thing.
In that envelope, we found one of those old school hotel keys to the El Capitan.
Let me guess.
Room 106?
No, but that's really close.
It's room 128.
Excuse me.
We just checked into this room.
Do you could come back later?
- But it's not clean.
- That's okay.
Neither are we.
Check this out.
That's weird.
- Let me call the front desk.
- What's going on?
Donny, whoever rented this room paid our friend Ginger to steal the cooler from you.
Hhe waited for her to make the drop, I'm guessing curiosity got the best of her and she opened it up.
But why would someone want to buy the virus?
I have a guess.
And much like this bedspread, it's not pretty.
This room was paid for in cash and registered to a Val Kilmer.
It's either an alias or Val has officially lost it.
So what now?
I could go for some joe.
This is a waste of time.
We're rushing to check out some coffee place that some mysterious person who may or may not be carrying a deadly virus may or may not have visited.
Well, I for one, trust Mr. Spencer's instincts on this.
Who is this?
We need to look into every possible lead at this point.
Besides, you were already wrong once today.
I've never seen Lassie put in his place.
It's hot.
I'd like her to put me in my place.
That makes no sense.
Spencer, what the hell are you doing?
Sorry, man.
You might want to get a biscotti.
You could be in there for a while.
CDC is pretty much done in there.
Everyone from the cafe has been moved to quarantine at Santa Barbara general.
Why don't you wipe that smile off your face, McNab?
Is this really necessary?
I didn't even go inside the cafe.
It's necessary.
Yeah, the CDC doesn't want to take any chances, so For the last time, who the hell is this?
I'm Donny Lieberman.
I'm the guy who screwed all this up.
I'm not big on nude handshakes.
They're probably just being safe.
That tickles.
Spencer, are you shampooing your hair?
Yes, I am, Lassie.
I always travel with a small packet of Johnson & Johnson's baby shampoo in my wallet.
Baby shampoo?
No more tears, Jules.
Take it easy, slugger.
What, are we dating?
I can't believe this.
First, we're looking for a prostitute.
- Now, I'm naked in a parking lot.
- It's just like our prom night.
- Shawn?
- Gus, relax.
Don't be Nic Cage's accent from Con Air.
- We've bathed together before.
- When we were three.
It's essentially the same thing.
It's just impolite to pee.
That feels great, by the way.
Dude, I'm freezing.
Give me your damn sweatshirt.
Ffine.
You're lucky I had it in the car.
You'll like how it smells.
Smell it.
Doctor Detective Carlton lassiter.
Dr. Steven Reidman.
Thornburg specialist, CDC.
Dr. Reidman is the foremost Thornburg authority not only in this state, but in all seven continents.
- He's here to help us.
- Is he, Jules?
No offense, doctor, but there's a lot of freaky-deaky stuff going on.
How can we be sure that you're a legit M.D.?
Well, for starters, I carry one of these in my pocket.
He's legit.
Excuse me, doctor, I feel I'm the most at risk being that this virus is a profiling racist.
I'm going to need an MRI, a cat scan, a pet scan, - and a biopsy of everything.
- I'd like some mac and cheese, but I don't think this is " ask for whatever you want day".
Stop it!
- What do we know so far?
- I had this hospital prepared as soon as I heard that the virus had been stolen.
Now, the cafe patrons are currently in isolation along with the courier because he was around the virus a lot.
Now, so far, only two are showing the early symptoms of Thornburg.
Only two?
Thank God.
I will hazard a guess that they touched the sample accidentally, because the virus is not typically effective as an aerosol.
Unlike Axe for men, which is highly effective.
It's like catnip for women.
As I was saying, normally one has to come in contact with an infected person's secretions.
But the good news is, if any of these people were infected, there is a lab less than two hours away in which they are developing a new antiviral that has shown positive results in early testing.
- When's it gonna get here?
- En route as we speak.
And since our culprit has already used his sample, I think it's safe to say that we have this problem pretty well bottled up.
Potential disaster averted.
Speaking of disasters, doctor, what is your opinion of detective Lassiter's hair?
Scientifically If he were to grow it, his ears wouldn't stick out as much.
- Well, if you - Carlton.
We need to get an I.D. on the man who did this.
Is it safe to interview the patients?
Just remember to wear the hazmat suit.
Spencer one to ground control.
I am ready to commence orbit.
We read you loud and clear, Spencer one.
Good luck.
Greetings, I'm Shawn Spencer.
Roger that, ground control.
So, Melissa, hello.
Did you notice anyone suspicious in the cafe today?
Anyone who entered or left abruptly?
Not really.
But I was reading my book most of the time.
I see.
And how are you feeling?
Nervous, mostly.
Perfectly normal.
Do you need us to contact anyone for you?
A husband or boyfriend?
I'm single.
- But my sister's on her way.
- Really?
Gus, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Let me handle this.
Melissa, how many sexual partners have you had in the last six months?
Enough with that song already.
I can't reach my back pocket.
Punch me in the ass.
- You must be outta your mind.
- Just sock me in the butt.
Do you guys work for the hospital?
So you didn't notice anything suspicious in the cafe.
According to your file, under "medications," you have listed neither rogaine or minoxidil.
- Is that correct?
- That's right.
Really?
You don't wanna try either of those?
Why?
Dude, I think there's something wrong with my suit.
- There's some rank smell in here now.
- You're like a giant dutch oven.
Wait a second.
I feel a bulge in your sweatshirt pocket.
- Are those your damn cornnuts?
- I was looking for those.
Nothing should smell that bad.
- You can't take that off.
- Why not?
You have to make a choice between nacho cheese heaven and something that could potentially kill you.
- Well?
- I'm thinking.
Nine people questioned and nothing?
- What next?
- Next taste these.
Okay, the antivirals are here.
Let's unpack and administer to the sick.
Yesterday, I was told to pick up a cooler from a lab called Genutech.
Dude Same lab that had the vial of Thornburg is also supplying the cure.
- Don't you think that's weird?
- I still smell like stinky nuts.
Gus, we don't have four hours to riff on that.
Let's go.
Dude, check it out.
It's Christopher Lloyd.
That man does not look like Chris Lloyd.
Show some respect.
He's 14 times smarter than you.
OK.
I'm sorry.
- Can I help?
- We're with cops and CDC on this outbreak thing.
Already told those guys that we shipped all the antivirals we had in storage.
You shipped everything you have for 2 patients?
They're going to need every drop.
Dr. Reidman says that the first patient needed 4 times the doses that we'd estimated.
And they want to administer it to everyone.
- So you're making more?
- Not yet.
We were shut down a week ago.
- Strike a clock tower with lightning?
- No.
We lost our funding because the government didn't see Thornburg as a serious threat.
But all these people getting sick is great news.
Great for the lab.
And great for Dr. Mallon.
Dr. Mallon?
This is his lab.
He got the funding to open up this place.
He worked for years on the antiviral.
But if this thing gets worse, we might start back up.
Excuse us.
We're gonna side bar, eh?
Mallon spends years on a cure, develop it, then his lab gets shut down.
A few days later, a Thornburg outbreak happens.
He took a sample to infect people, and then forced the government to put his lab back in business.
We're back!
So tell me, since Dr. Mallon isn't here, whereabouts might we find him?
I'm not sure.
I've been trying to call him.
But you can look for his address in that box.
It's the stuff lefted over from his office after it was emptied.
Do you think they have radioactive spiders?
Shawn, focus.
Let's see what we got here.
A fan of the theater.
Why?
We've already got this guy quarantined.
We're a little busy.
The second person who tested positive for Thornburg broke out before we treated him with the antiviral.
Let me take a psychic stab at that Pasty white guy desperately in need of hair plugs?
- That's right.
- Don't worry about him being sick.
I'm sensing that he has his own stash of the cure.
- How is that possible?
- Because not only did he invent it, I'm sensing that he also stole the Thornburg and then released it.
Oh, God.
It's okay.
Luckily there was only one vial of the virus.
He's already used that.
Excuse me.
We shipped three vials of the virus, not one.
There's two more.
Scratch that, Jules.
We have a big, big problem.
You know, you've never actually led a manhunt before, so maybe I should be the one to instruct the troops on finding Mallon.
No, I ordered the coroner to diagnose, I called in the CDC, I do the briefing.
Just remember, exude confidence and strength, but also heart and warmth.
You want to get behind the troops.
Try to project intelligence without sounding too - Pompous?
- Exactly.
You might just get this.
Everybody, listen up.
- Attention, please.
- Attention.
Eyes on detective O'Hara.
You're gonna do great.
This is Dr. Anthony Mallon.
Finding him is the top priority.
Find him but do not confront him.
Yes, thank you, detective.
Do not confront him.
If you do locate him - Call for backup.
- Thank you, again, detective.
- Do not startle him.
- He is carrying a very dangerous Virus!
If I may, detective.
Locating and bringing him in safely is crucial.
Keep in mind the best place to release her is in a public crowded place.
Preferably with a lot of people coming and going frequently.
- Yes?
- Her?
- Thornburg.
- The virus in the feminine tense?
Indeed.
If you knew her as I do, there's no mistaking her for anything other than a she.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Neither do women.
I hear that.
A fan of the theater.
I'm getting something.
I think I know what the next target might be.
I see the bus station and the Santa Barbara public theatre.
Both would work both have heavy foot traffic.
But I would bet on the bus station, there's greater population turnover.
- All right, everybody.
You heard him.
- Let's move.
Excuse me.
You divined this psychically?
- That's right.
- Fascinating.
If you should pass away, I would love to dissect your temporal lobe.
Sure.
I can't possibly see why not.
But I hope you get us all through this alive.
Yes, in that case, I would love to get my hands on a sample of your dna.
Weird.
Uncomfortable.
- Consider it done.
- I'm actually the brain behind this operation, you might want to get mine.
I could care less about your secretions.
However, I would love to get my craniometer around that giant raisinet of yours.
Or is it a goober?
Possibly a milk ball.
I say milk ball.
It's milk ball.
Cover those exits.
I do not want this guy getting away from us again.
And whatever you do, don't start a panic.
Go!
Oh, hell.
Citizens, stay away from this area.
You may have already been exposed to a deadly biological agent.
Is it important that you do not leave.
Because you could spread it to your loved ones and kill them.
Detective, this is a broken lightbulb.
As you were.
Some lightbulbs have halogen gas in them.
And tungsten.
There's a fun word.
Tungsten, tungsten, tungsten.
Correction, it's only fun to say it twice.
Why don't you get out of sight?
Mallon knows what you look like, and you're not trained.
What part of training is announcing our presence with a megaphone?
Go hide in a bathroom and stay out of our way.
All right, we'll go.
But not because you told us to.
Gus has to tinkle.
He must be out of his mind if he thinks I'm going to hide in a bathroom all day.
Gus, that's him.
That's him!
Hold it!
You should be all right, Shawn.
The seal on the vial is unbroken.
- We are lucky that you grabbed it.
- I'm no hero, Steve.
I didn't do anything that anyone with incredible upper body strength and native American cheekbones wouldn't do.
Hero?
Because of you, we lost Mallon.
He probably ran when he saw you.
You blew the whole operation, Spencer.
I told you to go hide in the toilet.
All units, move to secondary target.
That's the theater on main street.
Something doesn't make sense.
He was on his way out when I spotted him.
Why did he leave before releasing the Juju Mugumbo?
He aborted his plan.
He saw Mallon hovering by a newsstand.
Said he was sweating pretty badly.
Really?
I'm sensing he was limping as well.
Barley noticeable.
He's sick, Jules.
He has Thornburg.
I thought he had the cure.
They're gonna need every drop.
Dr. Reidman says that the first patient needed four times the estimated dosage.
He does.
But he didn't realize it wouldn't be enough.
He started showing symptoms when he got here, and then he booked.
I can see him.
It's him or Michael Ironside.
Why having a vision of Michael Ironside?
Exactly.
I know where he's going.
Looking for this?
It's the last of your cure.
It's why you came back to the hospital.
You've been self-medicating but still infected.
You didn't realize how much of this stuff it takes to fight your virus.
Give it to me.
Now!
We know everything, man.
We know you did all of this to save your lab.
That wasn't why.
When they shut me down, they left you and me and the entire country wide open.
Do you know how easily this stuff could be turned into a weapon?
But now, after this, we'll be ready.
That's not your garden variety crazy person logic.
I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a trade.
Cure for the last vial of your virus.
Let me see it.
Same time.
Don't touch me, man.
Is it there?
- Jules, what's going on?
- Shawn, don't come any closer.
- Give me that!
Give it to me now!
- Idiot!
There isn't enough here to help anybody.
There's gotta be more somewhere.
Just tell me how.
- I could save you both.
- Victoria.
Who's that?
Two hours from here.
Too far.
I think it's probable she contracted it In which case, she's gonna need the antiviral asap.
Based on my observations, I've concluded that mask and gloves will be sufficient if you decide to enter the dragon.
We need to find out who Mallon was talking about as he said, "Victoria".
It could be anybody.
A girlfriend, relative, who knows.
I got every detective in the department looking into it.
I just hope whoever it is has the cure.
- Victoria's not a person.
- What?
Victoria is a lake.
Isn't there a Lake Victoria around here?
A pond, really.
It's about two hours from here.
Two hours from here.
I used to practice figure skating there when I was little.
I mean, ice hockey.
I'm getting a very strong hit that he has a place there.
- Let's go check it out.
- Gus, stay with Jules, and call me if her condition changes.
All right.
Apparently Mallon bought this place about ten years ago.
That makes perfect sense.
He stashed a bunch of the cure, knowing it would be the perfect hideout after he released the virus.
We should creep around back.
Hey, Dirty Harry!
I'm not gonna shoot him.
He doesn't know that.
He doesn't know anything.
He's a dog.
- Well, do you have any better ideas?
- Maybe.
Do you still keep our softball gear in the trunk?
Yeah, why?
Where are you going?
Sit!
Sit!
- Whatever you do, don't freak out.
- I'm not freaking out.
It's normal if you do.
You're the one who's freaking out, Gus.
Yeah, because Thornburg is freaky.
But don't worry.
It likes white people.
You think Shawn and Lassiter are having any luck?
I know one thing.
If the cure is out there, Shawn will stop at nothing to find it.
On three.
Three!
Go, Lassie!
Run like the wind!
- Dude, did you get it?
- What?
Yeah.
I got it.
- Lassie's running it down to Reidman.
- Nice.
Are you okay?
I'm doing great.
I had a life-changing experience.
- What do you mean?
- I was running.
I was being chased by a very angry Rottweiler wearing catcher's gear and I had an epiphany.
The Rottweiler was wearing catcher's gear?
No, Gus, I was wearing the gear.
So I'm running and I realize two things.
One, I have a piece of beef jerky in my pocket.
So I grab and I toss it, and suddenly the dog doesn't care about me.
Two, I realize In life we never have as much time as we think we do.
- What do you mean?
- I mean Jules.
All this time, right?
We talk, we do our thing.
And I'm like, if something should happen between us, it will happen.
Like magic beans coming down on me.
But the truth is, my God.
She could die today and she would never know how I feel.
So what are you gonna do about it?
I'm gonna do this.
Good news, puffy.
I heard they got the cure.
I hadn't heard that.
It doesn't matter anyway.
She doesn't have Thornburg.
Really?
The tests came back negative.
She's got quite an immune system.
That's incredible.
Do you mind if I'm the first to tell her?
- Be my guest.
- Great.
- Excuse me, Shawn.
- Not now, Gus.
Just a minute.
Can it wait?
I'm about to tell Juliet something important.
Go to the cafeteria and get her some jell-o?
- Shawn.
- Please!
I've gotta get through this, man, come on.
There are things that you need to know, and I have to say them.
You don't have the Thornburg virus.
- What?
- What?
Are you kidding?
Dr. Reidman just told me.
- Oh, my God!
- You have more time than you thought.
Oh, my God!
I am so happy.
I am not going to die in this disgusting robe.
That's so That is so good!
But I still want to say what I was gonna say, If that's okay.
Sure.
How do I want to say this?
You know how when we were kids, there were all those cool prizes at the bottom of cereal boxes?
There are two kinds of kids.
There's the kid who flipped the box over and opened it from the bottom and grabbed the prize right away.
And then there was the kid who waited patiently and ate bowl after bowl of cereal until the prize just tumbled out on its own.
There's also a third kid named Mikey who will eat anything, including the prize.
He's not really important right now.
And?
I didn't wait.
I didn't wait for my decoder ring or my Frankenberry action figure when I was a kid.
So what am I waiting for now?
All I know is that I don't want to miss out on the prize.
What are you trying to say, Shawn?
That I I don't know.
I heard the good news.
Come here.
Sorry.
- Sorry.
Too much?
- A little bit.
- Just don't say anything.
- I wasn't.
I heard you were here.
Donny.
How are you, man?
Good.
No, more than good thanks to you guys.
You thankis us for the quarantine?
Because get this, while I was back there, I met a girl.
No, don't be silly.
This one is completely different.
She just got here from Russia.
There's a little bit of a language barrier, but she is so sweet, you know?
And apparently she only works nights.
So clearly I'm fired.
We can now spend all our days together, and she's already talking about moving in.
Have you considered the possibility that this girl could be using you?
Using me?
- Shawn, I hardly think so.
- You got your watch back, right?
So where is it?
Good luck, Donny.
Great news.
All the patients were released with a clean bill of health.
And here you go.
Professionally dry cleaned.
This is what you do when you borrow someone's clothes.
This should be wrinkled and stinky.
Are you still obsessing over the Juliet thing?
Yes, you are.
Look, let's go check out The Sydney J. Furie film festival.
I'm talking iron eagle II, lady sings the blues, and iron eagle IV.
If the taking of Beverly Hills is included, - count me in.
- Steve!
What are you and your porn'stache doing here in our office?
- A deal is a deal.
- It is, indeed.
- What are you talking about?
- I am not leaving here without your DNA.
Right I did say that I would You're in luck.
I just drank about a liter of teas' tea.
Let's take some measurements of that dome.
- What?
- Shall we?
Hold still.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
- What are you doing?
- My book report.
Didn't you just start this book a half an hour ago?
Yeah, I read the flap and then the first chapter, then I totally figured out the ending, so it's cool.
- How do you know that you're right?
- You taught me how to draw conclusions.
You know what you're doing, don't you?
Banking a whole afternoon of video game time.
You're operating on incomplete information.
It's sloppy, you're gonna find yourself embarrassed by it.
Dad, please, it's pretty obvious to figure out what's gonna happen.
Wilbur's gonna win the pig ribbon, and he and Charlotte are gonna live happily ever after.
All right, I'll tell you what.
If you get an "A" on that report, - I'm gonna take you to Disneyland.
- Sweet!
Good luck, kiddo.
You were doing exactly what I'm doing now when you poisoned Mr. Camfini's pizza.
Think about what you want on this pizza.
It's the last one you'll eat before you go to prison for murder.
I could also do a calzone.
It's the same basic principle, right?
Where's the pineapple?
You guys don't have any pineapple?
Dad?
- You gotta stop.
- I've made a pizza before.
You've got the wrong guy.
He's the only one who couldn't possibly have done this.
- Didn't you ever read the case file?
- Yeah, I read th Went over the summary and part of I don't have time to read case files.
Medical alert bracelet.
- The guy can't handle nuts.
- What?
Shawn, the poison was dissolved in peanut oil.
His hands would look like baseball mitts if he even got near that poison.
What'd I tell you?
First of all, let me apologize for this interruption of process.
I borrowed $5 from my father last week, and he's decided that now would be an appropriate time to collect.
Here you go, pop.
Here's your five clams.
Take it.
Buy your lotto tickets.
Waste it on false hopes, easy dreams.
Meanwhile, I will go back to doing what I do, which is working for a living.
Speaking of working for a living, how can you, sir, stand there with a clean conscience, while I accuse an innocent young man of murder, when it was in fact you who poisoned Mr. Camfini's pizza?
You did this?
Yes, I did.
I've had this place for 25 years.
I wasn't gonna let anyone sell off my place to some chain.
- This is a family business.
- I know.
I'm your nephew.
You were gonna let him take me?
You know what?
My work here is done.
Jules, cuff him.
Lassie, finish topping that pizza.
I got here as fast as I could.
What did I miss?
Just me nailin' that guy.
What are you talking about?
I nailed the guy.
How can you rewrite history?
He wrote a term paper on president Mitchell.
The fact is, I saved your ass in there once again.
- It's not the first time.
- Name another.
Are you kidding?
When don't you come to me for last-minute guidance?
I'm in a slump.
Gimme a break.
I'll give you this one on a technicality.
But all the other stuff you do, does that fall under fatherly duties?
Did that not sound like a thank you?
Hello.
Walter Snowden.
I'd like to introduce myself and say very impressive work.
Thanks, Walt.
I'm Shawn Spencer.
- This is my partner - Burton Guster.
Or should I say Ghee Buttersnaps or Lavender Gooms or Clementine Wooliesocks, perhaps?
- This guy really is a fan.
- A fan or a stalker.
Ghee Buttersnaps was said on a secure military base with no one else around.
Let's just say I've been following your work for quite a while now, and this last is very impressive.
I thought you were going to accuse that first gentleman.
Would have been completely ridiculous.
I wouldn't say completely ridiculous.
He did have a douchey face.
I saw what you were up to.
You turned it around.
You created a false sense of security for the real culprit, and then you coerced a confession out of him.
I mean, that was just Brilliant.
Let's just say that I am amazing and leave it at that.
I'd like to offer you a job.
Thank you, but no, thank you.
He already has a job.
Now, this is for the both of you, actually.
I run a fairly well-known private security firm, and I'm working for a gentleman who is quite important.
Walt, our jobs require that we go shirtless at any given moment, and this, no offense, sounds a little dry.
It's a two-week operation.
I'll offer you $8,500 a day.
- Do the math.
- Gus, do the math.
That's a lot of money.
What would we be doing exactly?
You'd be part of a prestigious think tank.
- A think tank?
- A hand-picked assembly of experts, who would be working with my client, Mr. Ashton Bonaventure.
- The billionaire businessman?
- That's fantastic.
I love that guy.
I love his mane.
He's looking for new product ideas.
No product ideas.
He will be after I pitch him the concept for the electric sponge.
This has nothing to do with businesses.
So what will we be doing?
Preventing his assassination.
Psych 414 "Think Tank" Timing: Psych Team The latest threat on Mr. Bonaventure's life has been alarmingly precise.
It states he will not survive his speech in Santa Barbara.
Any questions before we get in the room?
When will Gus and I be riding in Mr. Bonaventure's hot air balloon?
I don't even see where that is a part of your duties.
I see.
Can I ride on the back of his jet ski while he performs water doughnuts?
I don't see how that'll help protect him.
Will he at least leave the outgoing message on my answering machine?
I believe in doing whatever it takes to stimulate the creative process, within limits, and to that effect, I have addressed all of the items on your contract rider.
Rider?
We have people looking for your regulation-size trampoline, the packs of Big League Chew, and, of course, Mr. Guster's official NBA "let's blast it" air horn.
- I didn't want one of those.
- No, they'll find it.
This is where your work begins.
Now, the experts inside here are the brightest minds in their fields.
The ideas will be flying around fast.
Now we'll go over every attack scenario imaginable.
Mr. Bonaventure's life depends upon it.
Hope you're ready.
Oh, my God.
- Look at all the Skittles!
- You ordered them, Mr. Spencer.
I'd like to introduce you to your fellow think tank members.
This is Fred Collins Boyd, who is a retired agent for the secret service.
He was hand-picked by president Reagan.
Reagan was the one after Mitchell?
President Mitchell was played by Kevin Kline in Dave.
- He's a fictional character.
- No.
Dave was a fictional character who looked like president Mitchell.
And Svetlana Progoyovic, formerly an independent contractor working with government agencies, including the K.G.B. She's now working for the American government in a preventative capacity.
- Independent contractor.
That mean - Hit woman?
Yes.
- I shouldn't try - Don't even think about it.
And rounding out our team is Alan Zenuk, who graduated from M.I.T. And is now a leading crime statistician, dealing with odds and probabilities.
I see.
But didn't Winnie from The Wonder Years also do that, and wouldn't it have been way cooler to have her instead?
And I'd like to introduce you to Shawn Spencer and Burton Guster, who started a psychic detective agency four years ago and have since solved an impressive number of cases for the local police department.
- Gentlemen, have a seat.
- All right.
And, of course, you all know by now this is our client, maverick billionaire, Ashton Bonaventure.
He is an innovator on the cutting edge of the technological industry.
That makes sense.
I saw on Cribs that he has a soda fountain in his bedroom.
Yes, well, oddly enough, that is correct as well.
He also turned Wall Street upside down when he bought out Tetron Tech in '98.
- Thousands of people lost their jobs.
- Mr. Guster is on point, actually.
You do not do as well as he has done without leaving a tidal wave of enemies in your wake, and there have been three attempts on his life in the last two years.
It has become painfully apparent that there are blind spots in his security detail, and it is your job to tell us what they are.
If a bad guy can do it, I want us to have considered it beforehand.
- Any questions?
- Yes, I have a question for the statistician formerly known as Kenneth Branagh.
Without looking, can you tell me exactly how many Skittles are in this bowl?
Sorry.
And what is the probability that Gus will choose a green one?
Excuse me.
What brings Mr. Bonaventure to Santa Barbara?
The purpose of the visit is the company's annual board of directors address and to announce the rollout of a major new product.
Perhaps we should hear the rest from Mr. Bonaventure himself.
Hello, team.
Thank you for participating.
I can't imagine what it's like to be in your shoes right now, having your responsibilities.
Just know that I will do whatever I can to help you keep me alive out there, all right?
We're here to serve you, sir, so relax.
- We're on top of it.
- Mr. Bonaventure?
Spencer Shawn Spencer here.
Do you think that there is a market for a comb that works while you sleep?
You have to push the button to talk.
- Can you - No.
I'm not gonna ask him again.
He went scrooge on me.
Did you hear that?
If there's nothing more, let's get to work.
This is a schematic of the building where we think the attacker will strike.
I'm lookin' at the service entrance to the lower kitchen of the hotel here.
It is off-limits.
You cannot control a working environment with that many moving pieces.
I agree.
Most breaches would occur in that kitchen.
The only tactic here is to make the security team look the other way.
Give me that map.
I'll show you.
We're not participating.
They might as well be speaking Australian.
Now, look, it's like part giraffe, part Loch Ness monster.
Say something.
I'm having a vision.
Mr. Snowden.
You still care for her very deeply, don't you?
That's correct.
Svetlana?
You recently moved into a new residence, did you not?
Congratulations.
Very sexy.
Lava lamps, yes?
- What does that have to do with that?
- I'm not sure yet, Boyd.
That is how my gift works.
It's like acid reflux, but instead of acid, it's psychic-ness.
It's psychic-ness reflux.
- I'll tell you when you're gonna die.
- Thanks for the parlor tricks, but no.
If you don't mind, we're trying to figure out what we're supposed to do if bullets fly in this tight kitchen proximity here, so if you don't have anything on topic.
Under siege.
Seagal used a spatula to deflect bullets.
So you're saying we arm our people with spatulas?
No, I'm saying it was pretty cool, and he's Above the Law again.
I calculate the probability of that occurring to be 0.0%.
Let's switch to explosives as a present threat.
I've seen tiny plastique explosives in cell phones.
How crude and inaccurate.
Getting the phone to the target is difficult enough.
Getting them to use it is not predictable.
And how do you target your mark?
Personally, I'm quite fond of poisons.
A cell phone isn't predictable enough, but a poison is perfectly reliable.
- Is that what you're saying?
- I use skin contact.
I spray it directly on them.
It's as if I sneezed, and then it's How do you say?
Good night, Charlie.
Gus, how bad do you wish you were Charlie?
She's a killer, Shawn.
She kills people.
- But how bad?
- Really bad.
- And how do you get close?
- The easy answer is any uniform.
An assassin is 40% more likely to be disguised as a service person.
Whenever I consult, I always suggest that we immediately focus in on delivery personnel.
The public are conditioned to find uniformed persons as less suspicious.
When I had to walk through a crowd, I'd always try to appear as femine and disarming as possible.
You wore a bikini made of whipped cream?
I carry a baby.
A plastic one, of course.
I was born without a maternal instinct.
The larger question is what gaps are there in the security system that we can't account for?
There are always gaps.
You can't account for everything.
We can.
We have to.
Let's take a ten-minute break.
I have to have a conference call with Mr. Bonaventure's advance team.
- Can I talk to you?
- Certainly.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse us.
We'll be right back.
Keep your eyes off my draft, Boyd.
Follow me.
Please tell me that the trampoline has arrived.
- It's not the trampoline.
- What is it?
Time is of the "es-sance".
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I understand.
We'll let 'em know right away, sir.
Over here, Shawn.
Dude, this is kind of exciting.
What's behind there?
- That says "exit".
- I know.
We are completely making fools of ourselves inside there.
We need to cut our losses and go home.
This slump of yours is out of control.
I admit we're having some early trouble, but that room is like kryptonite to my skills.
It's, like, neutralizing my weapons.
I need to see thingsand touch stuff.
Has it ever occurred to you that these are the kind of people that could figure out you're not who you say you are?
- Come on, son.
- Do not do Ed Lover on me.
We need to wow them with ideas and we're right back in business.
Or completely out of business.
If we're gonna stay here, you need to call your dad.
- Since when do I need his help?
- You called him to get here.
Which we didn't use.
I may not be a planner, or a detail man, or a taxpayer, but when push comes to shove, I work, - and I get the job done.
- My gosh.
Now follow me back in there, and let's blow these guys' minds, scanners-style.
We chose this hotel specifically because none of the surrounding buildings are higher than two stories, so if we surround him with all six bodyguards, then we have seemingly eliminated all possibilities of an attack.
- So what are we missing?
- Here comes the wow.
- Yes, Mr. Spencer, you have something?
- As a matter of fact, I do, Walt.
If the assassin is unable to take a shot from above, then I think there is a very, very good possibility that he will shoot from beneath.
- From beneath?
- Indeed.
Shoot from beneath.
So, what are you saying, the killer's like a groundhog, who digs little tunnels in the earth, something like that?
- What are you calculating, Alan?
- The odds of Mr. Spencer getting fired.
What?
I think that's about enough for today.
Let's meet tomorrow, 8:00 sharp.
I was just gettin' warmed up, man.
It's really scraping the bottom of the barrel, asking Lassie for help.
Your ability to know nothing about real police work has finally caught up to you.
- We can always just - We're not calling my dad.
I can do this by myself.
Exactly how does that work?
- Whatever do you mean, chief?
- With your father.
See, I saw him at the pizza place.
You sure did.
You see, he missed most of my baseball games as a kid, and recently, he has been trying to show me more support in my ventures.
This is big boy work, so what do you want?
Quick question, more of a trivia thing.
Kind of a "what if".
- Get to it.
- Have you ever given any thought to how or when someone would try to assassinate Ashton Bonaventure?
Don't spout out everything Tom Cruise did in Valkyrie, I already pitched that.
Bonaventure?
- You're working for Bonaventure?
- Us and some other experts.
I've been trying since forever to get on one of these private security details.
I wrote to Gerald Ford when I was a kid, telling him I wanted to protect him, and that I loved him.
This might be your lucky day, 'cause I'm thinking of letting you in.
- Throwing you a bone.
- I'm not going to help you.
If they wanted my ideas they could have asked me themselves.
Gus has 100 large in his pocket.
Are you trying to bribe me?
Fair enough.
You drive a hard bargain.
And 3 bucks for a baby nugget?
This is ridiculous!
I know everything there is about Bonaventure.
I've been dealing with his people for weeks, coordinating crowd control.
I would have been a real asset in that room.
I'm gonna call Bill McGoldrick.
- Who?
- He's head of security.
He hate me.
I don't know him.
We've been dealing with Walter Snowden.
- Who's that?
- Walter Snowden?
- Head of Snowden security?
- I've never heard of Snowden security.
You don't know Walter Snowden?
I've never heard of Walter Snowden or Snowden security in my life.
Who is he?
Perhaps we should hear the rest from Mr. Bonaventure himself.
Just know He's the head of Bonaventure Head of think tank operations.
Crap.
Crap.
Now I gotta get a warrant to get in this place.
What the hell?
Damn.
Skittles?
Bonaventure has never heard of Snowden.
I don't get it.
We saw him on video.
- Video was fake, Gus.
- Fake?
Hello, team.
Thank you for participating.
It was footage of Bonaventure at a golf tournament or sales convention or something.
No, should have known better.
He would have loved my pillow comb idea.
Snowden tried to kill him in the past, but he could never crack Bonaventure's security.
If a bad guy can do it, I want us to have considered it beforehand.
He puts together this think tank to gather as many ideas as possible so that he can carry out the hit successfully.
There's no record of a Walter Snowden in our database.
- What about the others?
- Boyd, Progoyovic, and Zenuk all check out.
We will question them.
So let me get this straight.
You joined this organization, didn't bother to check if they were legit, and then you gave 'em ideas about how to kill one of your idols?
If it's any consolation, all of his ideas stank.
- Stunk.
- Stank.
- Stinkeded?
- I'm sure they did.
I won't say that I'm not gonna hold this over your head forever, because, honestly, of course I am.
It's not the time to gloat 'cause you're right for the first time in your life.
I'm just having a mini slump.
The important thing is, I need evidence bags for the rest of those Skittles.
We have four days to find this guy.
- Why four days?
- That's when Bonaventure gets to town.
Bonaventure's flight got in four hours ago.
- He's already at his hotel.
- Hopefully alive.
What is the meaning of this interruption?
I believe that you will be in grave danger, and believe that there will be an attempt made on your life.
- And how do you know that?
- Because I am a psychic.
I'm also An inventor.
It's a pillow that combs your hair while you sleep.
Check it out.
You need to cancel your speech tonight, and we need to get you out of town.
No, this is the most important appearance of the year for me.
to launch what I'm going to announce.
If we don't go first, we're finished.
Five years of development.
I'm going on.
My company depends on it.
No, sir, your attackers depend on it.
I pay these people very well to keep me safe, and nothing in this world is gonna stop me from making that speech.
Right now, you're not safe, and this guy, who has solved over 50 unsolvable cases, is your best chance to live.
- And why is that?
- Because solving these unsolvable cases is usually impressive to people, and because I spent the last 12 hours with your would-be assassin, and I know every single little thing that he might try.
All right, psychic, here's your shot.
I'm going to my car.
Get me there.
I've even seen tiny plastique explosives in cell phones.
Don't answer that.
That stays where it is.
In fact, everybody, cell phones out.
Let's see 'em.
Now put 'em on the floor.
Let's move.
Generally people are programmed to find persons in uniform less suspicious.
The maid.
The maid!
Axe for men?
What?
She's clean.
Me?
I carry a baby.
Baby.
- The baby?
- The baby!
Baby's real.
She's clean.
I use skin contact.
Feel it, orchid man!
Nice try!
It's water.
He's clean.
He's clean.
I think we can all agree that that was a horrible mistake.
Good job tackling that maid, though.
I think the only thing to come out of this exercise will be lawsuits.
I'd call my lawyer, but I seem to have dropped my phone.
Wait!
Hair looks great.
Chief, I really don't see the point in getting upset over spilled milk.
Why would I be upset?
The most powerful businessman in the state is the target of an assassination, and one of my people helped plan it.
- It was two.
Gus was there as well.
- Why would you say that?
It might help cushion the blow if we distribute the blame.
- Cushion who?
- I guess me mostly.
Chief, the man that we are looking for is operating under the alias of "Walter Snowden".
The remaining members of the bogus think tank have given us a detailed description of his features.
He is obviously well-funded and deeply connected.
Here's the sketch.
- May I?
- Certainly.
Just a moment.
I know this man.
- Do you know from where?
- Court.
Some sort of lawsuit.
- What kind of suit?
- I believe it was wrongful death, something in one of our factories.
You still care for her very deeply, don't you?
That's correct.
It was his wife.
Yes, I believe it was.
As I recall, we settled.
And you don't know his name?
I spend a lot of time in court.
It's the nature of my position.
All right.
O'Hara, let's get on anybody who may have had any court battles with Mr. Bonaventure's company.
And, Mr. Bonaventure, I cannot express with words the horror of these developments.
Members of our consulting team being involved is a shock, and this will be dealt with for the future.
You obviously have our full cooperation.
If you insist on keeping your public appearance this evening, we will provide a full security detail.
Actually, this man is the only one who successfully protected me this week.
- He saved my life.
- He also put your life in danger.
- Why would you say that?
- Turnabout.
So as I understand it, the suspect offered all of you $8,500 a day, with the exception of Mr. Boyd who received 9,500.
- How come you got more?
- Yeah.
He tells the future.
All you've told us is the plot to Die Hard 3.
Yeah, and that isn't difficult to ascertain?
Calm down.
Maybe it was 8,500.
It wasn't about the money.
Let it go, gentlemen.
The check didn't even clear.
This is a total disaster.
Now we got nothin'.
That's not entirely true.
We got this dope NBA air horn.
Stop screwing around!
I will be running point on this, ladies and gentlemen.
Actually, I want Mr. Spencer to work point With my team.
Feel that!
That is a very bad decision.
I don't make bad decisions, and your participation is entirely my call.
Mr. Spencer is my choice.
- Well what, Lassie?
- What do you want to do?
- This was way more fun a moment ago.
- In other words, you have no idea.
Of course, I have an idea.
What we're going to do is reassemble the think tank.
All right, first of all, let me just say that this is very, very exciting for me.
I like to do things differently, so no one will call me Mr. Spencer.
It's Shawn.
Shawny if you're feeling a little loose.
Never the Shawn dog, 'cause that's just lame, and I've never been one to chase balls.
We will check our egos at the door, along with our watches, because time does not exist in this room.
So let's see 'em.
Watches down.
Come on.
Take 'em off.
Means you, too, Stoltz.
Let's do it.
Very nice.
I like it.
Now, what do we know?
Bonaventure will not budge on his plans.
We also know that the killer is very determined.
Bonny boom-boom's gonna take the stage for his shareholders speech at exactly 7:20 p.m. That gives us Watches on.
No, wait.
I can just make out the clock from here.
Is it 3:00?
Is it 2:00?
Is that a clock?
You know what?
Forget it.
- Let's open things up to the room.
- Finally.
I could see two clear weaknesses, here and here.
Three.
Now open up your earlobes.
I will elaborate.
Number one, location and its susceptibility to penetration.
She you Erect structures must defend external forces, not only physically, but also psychologically.
We need to think outside of the box.
What is this?
Anybody?
- A low-fat muffin?
- No!
The speech will be given here in the empire ballroom.
We will keep a secure holding area that is connected solely by this service corridor.
I sense that once he is on the pedestal, this area will be safe.
Question, big bear?
Stop callin' me that.
I'll have to come up with a new code name.
Little bear certainly isn't gonna do the trick.
You're wastin' all these uniforms against this back wall.
You leave the points of access, the doors, the wings, more open.
See, this wall acts as your barrier.
Gotta make these cops more useful.
They will be more useful.
I'm gonna have them thinking of Xmas present ideas while they wait, and gift certificates will not be considered.
Okay then, it's settled.
We will put our defenses here in the front.
Chief, this is just stupid.
He doesn't let the senior ranking member on this force?
You've got your team, he's got his.
We put him into this position.
It's our job to get him out.
Chief?
We have a plan.
Stand by the door?
That's ridiculous.
I'm essentially a security guard in your plan.
Are you kidding me?
You are Kevin Costner in this plan.
You're in charge of the entire audience.
- I should be with Bonaventure.
- I brought that up.
He finds you unsettling.
He mentioned me?
Yes.
He also said you were creepy, but he did mention you.
- By name?
- He called you "Lazenby".
Come on, Carlton, we're fine.
It's not about who gets what title.
- The man's life is at stake.
- What else isn't important?
That fact that I'm adding a surprise element the second - that I open this door.
- Wait a minute.
- What surprise element?
- Pardon me?
What do you mean, surprise element?
We have been playing from behind this whole time.
It is now that I will use this!
- Your finger?
- My gift.
Someone knew your route too well.
There's a mole on your own team.
My people have been with me for ten years.
They should be used to the unexpected.
- What are you doing?
- We're going on the offensive.
You are set to take the stage at 7:20.
That means that Dadgummit.
You have a watch on, 'cause I forgot to put Oh, chop chop, gentlemen.
I'm on in five minutes.
Not exactly.
What?
The only thing in the entire universe that your attacker knows is that you will take the podium at 7:20 p.m. He will have to be in position, he will be at his most vulnerable, a veritable sitting duck if we can find him, and I will find him.
I will be able to sense him, and I will most likely be able to see him.
And how will you do that?
I will go on first, sir.
What, on?
Where?
The podium.
I will stall for as long as it takes, sensing the crowd, smelling them, anything out of place, then the cops and your team, will suss him out, and you will follow.
No, that is not acceptable.
- Hand to the head, not working.
- That's why I added sound effects.
Mr. Bonaventure, I know how this is going to end, and I am the only one that can offer you that guarantee.
- Have I been wrong yet?
- The maid, the gardener, the baby.
- Why would you say that?
- I don't know.
Symmetry?
Regardless, I've gotten you this far.
Now what do you value more, your life or a slight delay in your speech?
Shareholders, board members, members of the press, attractive businesswomen with your spiky heels and your ankle tattoos.
Raise your hand if you vacuum topless to Carly Simon.
I'm kidding.
Welcome.
Welcome, all of you.
My name is Shawn, and I am the opening act, Jack!
I apologize in advance if I completely blow your minds.
There's a man False alarm.
I am here to say that greed for lack of a better word, is good.
It's right.
Greed works.
Greed for life, for money, for love, for flan.
What is synergy?
What is he doing?
I really have no idea, but you have to give him a chance.
I think.
Maybe.
What the hell is he doing?
- I'm trying to find out.
- I'm gonna get you guys an eyeball, so would you just calm your asses down?
About stock splits?
Because we're just gonna keep splitting stocks, people, and if the stock don't split, you must acquit.
Excuse me.
I'm getting a vibe.
Check the air vents.
Stay up there, Shawn.
Give us a minute.
Let's talk about the future.
The true tragedy is that we are a part of the most technologically advanced company in all of California, and yet, I walked up onto this stage, when we all know, I should have flown via jet pack.
Who's with me?
Are my shoes electric?
No.
Does my pillow comb my hair at night while I am sleeping?
No!
Sadly, it does not.
And where, I ask you, is the hoverboard technology that we all saw in Back to the Future II over 20 years ago?
How come that hasn't materialized?
We will be allocating a significant amount of our resources to making that happen.
- Don't move!
Drop the gun!
- Hands in the air!
Now!
And that's not even counting the treadmill that we all saw so beautifully realized in the opening credits of the Jetsons.
- We got him.
- What?
What do you mean?
We got him?
We "got him" got him?
- Get me out there.
- Bonny boom-boom is on the move.
And I think it's about time we had weapons that were designed to kill zombies!
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
We are not doing hovercrafts, all right?
And greed and flan are also a no-no.
Now then.
Picked him up like a U.P.S. man, I don't think he was going duck hunting.
You blew it when you chose a psychic.
Didn't you know I would peg you?
That's a thing.
Pegging people?
Blowin' smoke about the trampoline being on its way too.
"On a flatbed from Albuquerque", he says.
My ass!
- I thought you were an idiot.
- We've all been there.
You got our frequencies.
Wait.
That doesn't make any sense.
If he had our frequency, he would have known we were onto him and got out.
He wasn't listening to us.
He has a microphone.
Who are you talking to?
Who's your partner?
If he had a partner, why would he need the think tank?
The only tactic is to have the security team look the other way.
They needed ideas.
They tried once and they failed.
The hit woman gave them the plan.
Wait a minute.
- Which vent did you find him in?
- It was the one off the back wall?
You're wasting all your us here at this back wall.
You leave your access points, The doors, the wings, more open.
I know who we're looking for.
Boyd purposely directed us away from the vents.
- Snowden had a mole in the room.
- Where did we put Boyd on the detail?
Upstairs.
I wasn't about to trust somebody I didn't know.
Split up.
But onto a more serious sub OK, you're out of here.
- I'm trying to undo some damage here.
- Are you kidding me?
I inspired them.
- I don't want to argue.
Just go.
- There's another killer.
In the building, there's two of 'em.
It's a team.
Let's take a left here.
Is your car waiting for you?
Of course, it is.
Where's my team?
Gus is getting them.
Don't worry.
- Move, move, move!
- Look out!
Son of a bitch!
Boyd's gone.
To your car, and we're home free.
Clear!
Go!
Go, go, go!
What's the hold up?
Oh, man.
What are you, a hired gun?
I get it with Snowden.
He wanted vengeance.
You're gonna throw everything away for another man's vendetta?
You don't remember me from the trial, do you?
She was my sister.
You and your lawyers decided her life was worth $1.2 million.
"It's more than fair", they said.
I tried to make amends.
Let me handle this.
I have experience in these situations.
You wrote checks.
That's all you did.
We took your money, and we put it towards making you pay.
It's kind of ironic, isn't it?
You financed your own murder.
Boyd, or whatever your real name is, - You are a very smart man.
- You're an idiot.
You were worthless in that room, and you're useless now.
We can all agree than name-calling is beneath you.
It's not gonna work.
I got your guy locked in my sights, and I will shoot him.
Unless you want to be the second victim, I suggest you hold very still.
Who are you kidding?
If you were gonna kill him, you would have already shot.
This is personal.
I'm waiting to see the right look on his face.
Remember when we were in the room, and I was talkin' about trampolines?
They're incredibly therapeutic.
So why don't you and I go find ourselves a big one - And bounce like gentlemen?
- Are you suicidal?
Is that it?
- Get out of the car!
- Hands in the air!
- You got him?
- I got him.
You all right?
Let me ask you a question.
Do you hate waking up with bed head in the mornings?
What?
I can't You know what?
Never mind.
It's okay.
You want to tell me what this is about?
Wanted you to know that I saw you at the pizza place.
You know, I missed a lot of Shawn's games when he was a kid.
I just wanted to see him work.
Exactly how much input do you have in Shawn's cases?
I get involved in the process, I guess, and then his You know, his psychic-ness, it just takes over.
You retired young.
- Yeah, maybe a little.
- And you like being involved in cases?
I'd be lying if I didn't tell that I still got a bit of fuel left in my tank.
- I haven't regrets.
I've learned that.
- Do you want a job?
What?
Look, what happened this week is a mess, and it can't happen again.
We've been discussing for quite a while, creating a new position, a liaison of sorts, that would oversee our external divisions.
Working with other departments, agencies, outside help.
Psychics.
Our consultants would fall under that category, yes.
Don't get me wrong.
The benefits far outweigh the costs, but your son has turned this department on its head over the last four years.
- Try my life over the last 30.
- It wouldn't be a full-time position, Just part-time, few days a week.
We could discuss your schedule.
All it would take is just a little consideration on your part.
All right, listen, Karen, that's a very astute observation, and a fascinating offer, But I think I'm gonna stay retired.
And say thank you.
You're sure?
- Who are you talkin' to?
- Credit card company.
Oh, yes, as I was saying, somebody used my card to purchase a zebra-striped jacket.
- I would like that charge removed.
- You charged that jacket.
Gus, I said somebody.
Doesn't mean it wasn't me.
How was I supposed to know that Snowden's check was bogus?
Yes, of course, I'll hold.
I love holding.
There's a lesson to be learned here.
Do not spend your think tank money before you know whether the think tank is run by a vindictive murderer or not.
The real lesson is that we need to get into corporate consulting, because that's where we'll build our nest egg.
What you mean?
Giant trampoline for the office.
We'll never get another corporate gig, so it doesn't matter.
We have two lines?
Who do we know in Bulgarian consulate?
That's me.
Here.
Here, trade.
Another consulting gig.
¡Hola!
¿Como estan ustedes?
Mi llamo es Shawnito Rodriguez.
Mi gusta Bulgaria, y Y trampolina gigante!
Explosianos.
¿Por Por que?
I'm too sexy for my jacket Too sexy for my jacket It's such a racket And I'm too sexy for my gun Too sexy for my gun It's just no fun I'm too sexy for your party Too sexy for your party No way I'm disco dancing Cause I'm a model, you know what I mean And I do my little turn on the catwalk Yeah, you know what I mean I do my little turn on the catwalk
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Shawn, you have to understand why I'm conflicted here.
It's very difficult to comfort you Over what is the worst sequel ever made.
Dad Shawn, you are not gonna be eaten by a shark.
Sharks do not attack people willy-nilly.
That's crazy.
So many random scenarios have to line up.
- Really?
- Of course.
First of all, the shark has to be hungry.
He has to be attracted to jumping, kicking, Or sudden movements in the water Or maybe even somebody with a cut.
But isn't it true That most shark attacks occur in 3 feet of water?
Of course it is.
But that's where the swimmers are.
So that's a skewed sample.
Do I watch for the fin?
No, that only happens in the movies.
You never see them coming.
That's why they're called the silent killers.
I thought that was hypertension.
Either way, stop thinking about it.
Could you do that?
Yeah.
Okay.
Anyways, don't they sleep during the day?
No, sharks never sleep.
Just get out there, have some fun, And remember-- slow, steady movements.
Get in.
That a boy.
Aah!
Carlton, what are you doing?
No time to talk, o'hara.
Just keep taking notes.
What's the rush?
That.
Every time we get a high-profile case, You know what's gonna happen next.
Spencer's gonna waltz in here, Make some crazy proclamation about what happened, And in five days, he's gonna be right.
Well, not today.
Mcnab?
Hold back the wonder twins.
Oh, come on.
Really, buzz?
This is the thanks I get for giving you a cat And finding a guy to remove your "baja men" tattoo?
Sorry, guys.
He's really determined today.
- Let's just go.
- Yeah, you're probably right.
You don't want to go down there.
I know how you feel about dead things.
- What?
- You know, the whole Not only is that an affront to my character, shawn, But I'll have you know, I'm turning over a new leaf.
I'm now hardened.
I've seen it all.
You've seen it all through the cracks in your fingers While you're hiding your eyes.
You know what?
That's it.
We've been doing this for four years.
I don't need you to look out for me.
I have a new name now.
For now on, I want you to call me "guts".
- We all call you that.
- No.
"guts," shawn.
- What--what are you saying?
- "guts"!
- You're saying "guts"?
- Yes.
- That's too close to gus.
- You know, never mind.
Call me "old ironside.
" - michael ironside?
Old iron stomach-- That's me.
Carlton, you can't solve a case in four minutes.
Can't I?
I think I can.
I've seen it done.
- Not by you.
- Thanks for that.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
You are a great detective.
It's just that-- There's a piercing in the skin.
There are lots of them.
It's a shark attack.
No.
No, this one's different.
It's cleaner.
It's a knife wound.
A knife wound?
- Spencer would say it.
- You're not him.
And thank the sweet lord for that.
It's now or never, o'hara.
Week after week, I sit idly by Doing life-sucking, soul-eating detailed police work While he just bounces in And hops from one wild conclusion to the next, Only to be right.
This knife wound is good.
It's big.
And I'm gonna jump on it before he does.
Today I'm going to out-spencer spencer.
All right, mcnab.
Send them down.
Go ahead.
Carlton, no good can come of this.
It can only end disastrously.
If by disastrously you mean triumphantly, Then, yes, I agree.
If not, I would like to invite you, in the nicest way possible, To shut it.
Is this the same shark spotted last week By the whale-watching boat?
Can you give us any details on the shark attack?
Well, we've got a couple problems with that.
First of all, our victim is a john doe.
And what's the other problem?
- Watch how I do this.
- Please don't make me.
Our victim wasn't killed by a shark.
He was murdered.
no, seriously.
No, I'm--I'm not kidding.
He was murdered.
What about those things that look like shark bites?
Yeah, those are shark bites.
and those at the shoulder?
Yes, those are also shark bites.
Can you spell your last name?
Are you telling me you don't know how to spell lassiter?
No, I do.
I just want to see if you did.
one follow-up question.
Does the shark have an alibi?
Do you think the shark can have a fair trial In this jurisdiction, Or will you have to pick your jury from the aquarium?
* in between the lines, there's a lot of obscurity * * I'm not inclined to resign to maturity * * if it's all right * * then you're all wrong * * but why bounce around to the same damn song * * you'd rather run when you can crawl * * I know you know * * that I'm not tellin' the truth * * I know you know * * they just don't have any proof * * embrace the deception * * learn how to bend * * your worst inhibitions * * tend to psych you out in the end * "detective dipstick at it again"?
What the hell do they mean "again"?
It's the courier.
It's not even a real newspaper.
Besides, nobody reads the paper these days anyway.
- Why didn't you stop me?
- Oh, I don't know.
I guess I was busy rsvping my invitation to "shut it".
- Sorry about that.
- Yeah.
Look, you can still salvage this.
We just forget yesterday ever happened, And we find out who it was that washed ashore.
I've been at this all night.
Nobody's been reported missing locally or statewide.
I can't even I.D. The body.
I'm the worst detective ever.
Mr. Dipstick Might I get you to sign my copy of today's paper?
Okay, that is libel Or slander.
It's also copyright infringement.
I registered this six months ago.
He did.
Also "officer whoopsie".
- I forgot about that.
- Yeah.
Don't worry, you get 5% of any action-figure money When hasbro comes on board.
- This is your fault, spencer.
- My fault?
Yeah, you got all up in my head.
okay, first of all, I wouldn't last five minutes in your head.
That was just some innocent ribbing between colleagues.
But here's the thing I honestly think you're on the right track, lassie.
If you hadn't had mcnab stop us, We probably would have made the same guess.
I would have guessed ape attack.
Gus, it's never, ever an ape attack.
Oh, it will be.
Mark my words.
You saw the knife wound, did you not?
It looked like a knife wound, And I've regretted it ever since I said it.
No.
Don't regret it.
Don't you see?
This should be the best moment of your life.
You should-- you should feel liberated In your guts, because you're following your guts!
You found the piece that didn't fit, And even though you don't know how it connects, You announced it to the world anyway.
Spencer, one loose end doesn't make it foul play.
- It doesn't?
- How do you think We've stayed in business these last four years?
But what if it does, lassie?
We're comrades now.
I do this all the time.
I can walk you through this.
This is just the weird part Of the "spit out a crazy theory" process.
You say it, everyone thinks you're crazy, You're incompetent, you should probably color your sideburns.
Truth We're one in the same.
We're "shassie" now.
We're "sharlton".
We're "spencitter".
Oh, my god.
Make no mistake.
This is definitely your fault.
I've heard that, But I'm trying to figure out how.
We are going to the coroner's office, And you're coming with.
Sweet.
I love that guy.
All right, I can take it.
It was a shark attack, right?
I was told to wait.
For what?
Woody!
Hello, friend.
Now we can begin.
The victim was chewed off just below the waist - Tin tummy.
- Iron stomach.
Was found wearing a very expensive watch, Not waterproof Which is not typical of a serious boatsman.
We have no fingerprints, naturally, As there-- there are no fingers.
Continue.
Cut off at the wrist, huh?
Interesting.
Is there anything to help us I.D. Him?
Dental records were inconclusive.
We do have the remnants of a belt, Which means the man probably had a wallet on him Which would likely still be inside the shark, Until it's digested.
At the very least, we could find a finger in there We could get a print off of.
- How do you feel?
- Peachy.
All right, I give up.
Our prime suspect is a shark.
What?
You're giving up on the murder thing already?
What about the suspicious stab wound?
Well, now that I look at it, You know, in the lights and everything, It looks just like a shark-bite wound.
Don't do it, lassie.
Don'tDo it.
Stick to your guns.
Follow your instincts.
Believe in yourself like I believe in you.
Do not start singing right now.
Actually, lassie, That particular wound- it's intriguing.
Now, I'm not saying it's likely, But I cannot, in good conscience, According to my oath, say it is not a knife wound.
What do you mean?
You see, it's It's jagged, like a tooth mark, But it's slightly different from the others.
It's difficult to tell without finding the rest of the body, But it could have been made by a knife.
So you're saying I could have been right?
Well, the knife would have to have Many of the characteristics of shark teeth.
What would this knife look like?
Well, uh, probably something Like this.
And then we've got, you know, the teeth Jagged there.
Sure.
Dear god, what am I doing?
This is half a man.
It's all right.
Look.
Look at that.
You see that?
You see it match?
- It's a reach.
- Reach?
Lassie Do you ever get tired of being wrong, Of being beaten to the punch?
Would you trust your guts And let those reporters know That it is them who are actually the dipsticks?
All right.
Let's get a chopper in the air, Get us a boat and a decent fishermen.
We're gonna find this shark, slice it open, I.D. The victim, And then we're gonna figure out who wanted to murder him.
Yes!
Do my theories sound that insane?
Sometimes insaner.
- So we're back on murder?
- Shut it.
You say that again, I shoot you.
That is the spirit, man.
You are back on the crazy train.
You want to know how I do it next?
That felt like a reluctant no.
We should follow.
What in the world is going on here?
Somebody put out a $10,000 reward For the capture of the shark.
Now every nut job in town with an outboard Is hitting the water trying to find it.
Whoa!
- Is that dynamite?
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop right there, you backwoods hill people.
There is evidence in that shark!
Get back-- Have you got a license for that?
This is where it gets harder.
Leave me alone.
Sir, I need to commandeer your boat.
It's vegetarian.
Okay, so you're telling me That every boat you have has been rented.
Every lure, every reel.
$10,000 reward is a lot of money, officer.
Really?
You see this?
Well, that ain't gonna make a boat suddenly appear.
It isn't gonna fix my engine either.
Really?
All right, then, how about this?
Carlton!
Check with me tomorrow.
I may have this thing up and running by dawn.
No, no, tomorrow's way too late.
I need you to fix thing thing now!
You're worse than that guy in the papers.
What's his name, detective - Dipstick!
- Not another word!
Who's that?
He's not with me.
I can't believe I'm supporting this, But I have managed to secure a police boat.
Sweet!
We can put our heads together-- Two mismatched partners off on a harebrained adventure.
Spencer, I want nothing to do with you.
We are not compadres.
We are not partners.
We are nothing.
Are we at least amigos?
- Homeboys?
- Platonic soul mates?
No.
Shove off, captain.
I've got a man-eating shark to catch With evidence inside.
It's almost as if we're not invited.
No.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, not you too.
What?
You're going after the shark reward?
What?
What are you, crazy?
What's with all the equipment?
This stuff belongs to a buddy of mine.
We're gonna go out, and we're gonna hunt some marlin.
Wayans?
Well, it's about time.
Get out there, quick, before they make another white chicks.
White chicks was hilarious, shawn.
Look, carlton, so you didn't catch the shark.
It doesn't mean you're a bad cop.
It only means that you're a bad-- Fisherman?
I'm sorry Were you about to say that I'm a bad fisherman?
That's not what I meant.
I am only saying That what happened today is not a reflection On your abilities as a detective.
I was being supportive.
By saying I'm a bad fisherman.
Only comparatively I mean, I didn't see Anybody else get their tie caught in a reel Or fire their gun pointlessly into the water.
It wasn't pointlessly!
I told you, that driftwood looked like a dorsal fin.
Then why did you yell freeze and hold your badge up first?
Force of habit.
And we both know that we got skunked, Because we got stuck with inadequate gear.
- It looked fine to me.
- Are you k-- I would have had better luck Just politely asking the fish to jump in the boat.
Trust me, o'hara, you know nothing about fishing.
Actually, I once spent three weeks with my dad On a charter off islamorada.
We fed tarpon by hand.
You know what, little miss "I obviously have daddy issues"?
If you want me to take a trip down memory lane with you, Why don't you start by not insulting the core of my being?
Fishing is one of my top-five skills Right behind profiling and skee-ball.
Carlton, you are taking this personally.
I am only suggesting that we bring in an expert.
Well, maybe I'm suggesting that you shut it!
Wow.
Wow.
I am so sorry.
I-I'm just dehydrated.
Hey!
I haven't seen that thing in two years.
Man, I need to get my numbers up.
We haven't had a paying case in three weeks.
Don't you worry.
I'm about to crack the shark murder case.
What?
You're kidding, right?
Check this out.
Shark tooth fi-letter.
- Filleter?
This thing probably Kind of makes The same, exact wound we saw at the coroner's office.
- Let me get this straight- - you're doing real police work, And lassiter's following some crazy hunch?
Stranger things have happened.
Name one.
Michelle pfeiffer dated fisher stevens.
And then he actually cheated on her.
It really wasn't about the reward.
It's about keeping the water safe.
But, uh, we got him.
We brought him in.
And, uh We'll make a few dinners out of him.
Ha!
I knew you lied to me at the marina.
I did not lie to you.
I was going out to hook a marlin, And I hooked a killer shark instead.
Now I'm a hero and $10,000 richer-- Serendipity.
We need to see that shark.
Oh, what?
Oh, so now you're interested in fishing?
Sort of.
Gus and I need a subject For an icky thump-ology experiment We're doing in our tree-house lab.
The study of fish is called ichthyology, shawn.
That's right, gus.
Remind me to put it on my list of funny words, Right between avuncular and mangrove.
We just need to see the shark's teeth To see if they match a wound.
Wait a second.
Are you workin with detective dipstick on this?
- You're calling him that too?
- I tried not to.
It just rolls right off the tongue.
Where is this thing, in the fridge?
Shawn, what do you think?
It's 9 feet long!
I have it on ice, But it's at an undisclosed location.
I'm getting something.
It's not dull.
Sharp's storage!
Disclosed.
Did you just pretend to be a psychic, to me?
- Sorry.
It's force of habit.
- Nobody is touching that shark.
We will be in and out in a matter of minutes.
I've got a photographer coming down tomorrow morning To take a picture of me with it.
- What, for your facebook page?
- No.
Magazine.
- Fish digest?
- Bald guys quarterly?
Coot's life?
Stop it.
Well, I feared it would be a spencer That got to that shark before me.
I just can't believe it turned out to be the other one.
I think I should be offended.
Gus?
Compliment to you.
Insult to your dad.
Well-executed two-fister.
Nice, lassie.
That shark is part of my ongoing investigation, And I need to see it, spencer.
Oh, that seems to be going around.
Henry, I'm appealing to you as a policeman and a father.
What the hell do you know about being a father?
It's official!
You heard detective dipstick.
Let's do this.
There isn't somebody here to let you in?
He was here.
He was here.
He had the key.
Are you sure you can do this?
I can do anything I want!
- Son of a-- - whoa.
Lassie, I know what you're thinking.
But I am not getting any pleasure Out of your "beflusterment" at this moment.
Not true-- I'm getting a fair amount.
But I'm still on your side.
Well?
Don't look at me like that.
That fish was gonna pay for my new roof.
Well, this is just great.
Someone steals my shark.
Now they're impeding a police investigation, And what's more, I look like a total fool.
I get it--all of a sudden, this is all about you.
- Oh, don't you get all - Lassie.
- Self-righteous on me, henry.
- Father!
I am in the middle of a murder investigation, And all you're worried about is your stupid prize money.
- A murder investigation?
- Look, guys I can't believe I'm saying this, But let's be reasonable.
-And hid it in a freakin' storage - Where did the lock - Pick up a telephone.
Say, "hey, lassiter, I"-- The thief was here recently, within the hour.
I couldn't pick up my phone.
I dropped it in the water.
Would you cut the crap?
You sound worse than your kid!
See that trail of ice?
It's barely melted.
That means whoever did this is still near.
So what, you're gonn track a shark on land?
Somehow it seems eier than doing it on the water.
I'm pretty sure it's not.
I will track this thing just like I tracked that sea lion To the deepest part of the big blue.
You stole a guy's old gps coordinates r that, shawn.
That changes the result how?
I can narrow it down to that way.
Give me your keys.
- No.
- It's a few blocks away.
- I don't care.
- Dad!
- It's right there!
Dad!
I'm sensing your shark.
It's nearby.
Warm up your super-sniffer.
We're gonna need it.
I got it.
we'll drive.
The toothed beast is here.
Where?
Somewhere OO-over--over there.
Here.
- Shawn No, it's this general It's this general a-area here.
Probably Stuffed back behind these large beads of I'm wrong!
It's this way.
It's-- Oh, my gosh.
Yeah.
It's definitely over there.
That's just-- that's just foul.
Aah!
Oh!
Aah!
aah!
Oh!
No.
I'm okay.
And thank you so mh For helping get the big, dead shark off of me!
Someone didn't want us to find the contents Of this shark's belly.
We're looking at a cover-up.
Actually, you're looking at the wrong shark.
- Who the hell are you?
- Dr. Kimberly phenix.
I run the ocean studies department at the university.
I'm also a pretty decent shark expert.
I didn't call for a shark expert.
Actually, you did.
Your partner called me yesterday, but I was out.
So you're the one they call, um, detective dipstick?
Detective lassiter, carlton lassiter.
Head detective carlton lassiter.
That's okay.
I read the article.
Had some bad ink myself too.
The press can be so snarky.
So how'd you find us?
I followed you from sharp's storage.
I was the one honking as you ran through all the red lights.
Whoa.
That is the god-given right Of any working police officer, lady.
Yeah, I was talking about him.
So I saw you on tv when you caught this guy.
Can't say I wasn't a little impressed.
Ah, well, thank you, miss, I, uh-- Miss--that's sweet, but it's doctor.
Or just kim.
But not dr.
Kim, 'cause I'm not a radio show host.
All right, doctor-- kim-- I'm gonna have to respectfully disagree with you About that fish.
- Yeah, me too.
I've done my homework.
This is the shark.
It's a man-eater, and it's rare for these waters.
You're right, but only kind of.
The shark you're looking for is indeed galeocerdo cuvier-- - A what?
- A tiger shark.
- Very good.
- Thank you.
But the shark that attacked that poor man Is probably more in the neighborhood of a 17-footer, Not this little guy.
Wait a minute.
That is not a little guy.
Duly noted.
And, yeah, it is.
Incidentally, I was, um Glad to see that it was a former cop who caught the shark Instead of a shark hunter.
My intentions were good.
He wanted the reward in a big, big way.
I was trying to keep the water safe for the children.
Were you, really?
All right, the reward crossed my mind, But a divorced man has to build his nest egg.
Did you just casually slip the word divorced Into a sentence to an apparently single woman?
Did you just casually slip single woman into your response?
Touche.
- Is this really happening?
- Yes.
I think your dad is totally in there.
Oh, please, gus, where's the decorum?
he's hitting on this poor woman In the middle of a crime scene.
Shawn, you did that three times in the last year.
I'll be right there.
A leg just washed up over on dodd beach.
Let's go.
- Care to join us?
- I'd love to.
- After you.
Man, he's got every play in your book.
Or have you been using his playbook all along?
What?
It's not a book.
It's a binder.
- What happened to you?
- I don't want to talk about it.
who's that?
My dad brought a date.
I didn't know he was seeing anyone.
He met her today.
He brought a woman he just met to an autopsy?
Yeah, who does that?
Shut up.
Maybe if we wait long enough, We'll be able to piece this poor guy together ourselves.
I know how you feel, young man.
You just--you have to breathe.
In, out.
Come on, in, out.
That's it.
Concentrate on your breathing.
You'll do fine.
Massive tissue loss.
- Partially denuded bone, and some odd markings Right here near the ankle.
Almost like he was tethered to something, Like a-a surfboard.
Do we have an I.D. On this guy yet?
Still pending.
We do have some preliminary data, and I-it's a bit odd.
It appears imbedded right here.
Surface tissue With completely different dna.
The shark must have had this tissue wedged in its teeth When he chomped down on this poor guy.
So what does this mean?
It means there was a second victim.
The prevailing wisdom Is that shark attacks are random acts Committed by a beast driven only by its next meal.
But I have a theory that these attacks occur Under conditions determined by a number of variables-- Air and water temperatures, currents, time of year, Things of that sort.
And they're anything but random.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
What?
I'm responsible for everyone?
The machine's right outside the door.
Anyway, by properly isolating the variables, We can extrapolate the data To predict and even prevent future attacks.
Any questions?
Yes.
How long before the fingers Inside the shark's stomach are digested And no longer usable for prints?
Carlton, there's more than one victim now.
The idea of murder is seeming like a stretch.
Maybe we should focus on the fact That there's a shark out there eating people.
Yes, but that doesn't mean That our first victim wasn't murdered Before he fell into the water and was devoured by the shark.
So, o'hara-- Do not invite me to shut it.
I-I wasn't going to.
Can you please tell me where this thing is?
Yeah.
Based on currents And where the body and the leg washed ashore, I can give you a better approximation, But I'll need some time to run the numbers.
Great.
O'hara, let's get down to that marina And get ourselves some real equipment And find the right shark before some idiot in a sea bus Rolls over it with a propeller.
Lassie, I have never been more in love with you Than I am at this moment.
You are virtually insane!
Getting real equipment is going to be a problem.
The mayor just upped the reward to $50,000.
Uh, sorry.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Let's get down there.
Is it true the reward's been increased?
Yes, the reward has been increased to $50,000 In an effort to keep the beaches open During the holiday weekend.
However, I would like to implore The overzealous middle-school dropouts in the crowd To exercise restraint.
Here's the bottom line.
I'm not going to commandeer your boats, per se, Although I believe I can.
Just know that you'll be performing A great community service If you turn it over us.
Otherwise, I will be arresting you For hindering a police investigation.
What?
O'hara, I'm kind of in the middle of something.
come here.
Don't go anywhere.
What?
What, what?
We found a guy matching the victim's description.
Great!
Figure out what he does and who he is.
We know who he is.
He's a web millionaire from seattle.
He came down a couple days ago.
Okay, that's a really strong maybe.
So put mcnab on it and get yourself some dramamine, Because we are gonna stay on that police boat Till we find the shark!
- We found his car.
- Wow!
Nice!
I'm still kind of talking to the sea trash.
It's in the parking lot!
- This parking lot?
- Yes!
It was abandoned three nights ago, And you need to see what's inside.
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah.
His name is dante pavan.
He has quite the personal crusade going on.
He's an ocean activist, big-time.
Oil drilling, whale-watching excursions-- You name it, he's against it.
Looks like he's brought his personal crusade To santa barbara.
Did he bring a boat?
Nope.
And no record of a rental or a purchase.
Never even checked into his hotel.
How did he get so far out in the current With his expensive watch and slacks without a boat?
He's been known to stage crazy, elaborate protests.
How crazy?
Well, he once threw himself into a commercial fishing net While a load was being pulled in.
He chained himself to a buoy to protest whaling.
That actually made the news.
He did the same thing on an oil-tanker anchor.
Rather odd markings here near the ankle, Almost like he was tethered to something.
Lassie, where'd you go?
We were totally videotaping your speech.
And we need you to sign a release For america's funniest home videos.
We're wrapping things up.
We've identified our victim.
What, that's it?
You're not going after the shark?
The only reason we needed the shark was to I.D. The body, Which we've done-- dante pavan.
He's an ocean activist nut job from seattle.
Leads an extreme group called oceans first.
That's so thin.
You're acting insane.
No, what's insane, spencer, Is that I've been listening to you for the last several days.
This is who I am- I am comforted by the facts, And these facts solve crimes.
This was a shark attack, not a murder.
Lassie, mark my words, There is something in that shark.
Why else would somebody steal my dad's And open the thing up?
I don't know, spencer.
Somebody wanted the reward money, And they figured out they got the wrong one.
That doesn't make any sense.
O'hara, check any, uh, snorkeling excursions, Whale-watching tours-- See if anyone had a dante pavan on the docket.
Bye, gentlemen.
This is where we part ways.
So what?
You want to go home, Or you want to go watch your dad Hit on that lady doctor for a while?
I'd rather dip my jewels in honey, Then go on a bear watch.
Our work here is not finished.
There's something in that shark.
We need someone to take us out to sea.
Hey, uh Excuse--if you could-- - What are you doing?
- How do you make that sound?
ee!
Eeee!
Eeeee You all know me.
No, we don't.
You know how I make my living.
We're still unclear on who you are.
I'm a psychic, jack!
Check your papers, not the front-- Page five and further back, sometimes the personals.
But believe me It's all there.
We remember shabby, don't we?
Shabby the sea lion?
Well, I tracked him at sea, Found out where the poor fellow was murdered In the entire ocean, The exact spot.
Tell them, gus.
I'd rather not.
You know what else?
I found an abandoned boat At sea at night.
I have keen senses.
My senses are very keen.
You know what?
I'm gonna lay out my history for you people, And by the end of it, You're all gonna be begging for my services, okay?
Four months ago, guy walks into our office, Says, "help me.
I'm a lycan".
Gus is like, "you're made out of seaweed"?
I said, "no, no, gus.
He's a werewolf".
We dressed up like civil war people, And gus looked like denzel washington in glory.
And some guy built a tunnel About two years ago, Some chick got hit in the head with a tennis-- You know what?
Screw that case.
I looked at my partner.
It was like looking at a child lost in a shopping mall.
Luckily, I'd solved the case.
The football players were protecting their bonuses, And that is why they left the disembodied foot On the path in the forest.
- That's not why they did it.
- Yeah, well, uh That one still confuses me.
The point is, that is but 20 Of my many, many cases that I have solved.
You can read the book when I learn how to type.
Sir, the fact that you haven't left Shows me you're not afraid of my gift And are ready to use it to catch this shark.
I think we have ourselves a boat.
Are we gonna get to sing sea chanteys Or any other kind of chanteys?
Do you have dramamine, or should I just bring my own?
Oh, gus wants to know if you have cable on your boat, Because it's the season finale of leverage, And his tivo's on the fritz.
Your job is to shut up.
Okay, that's good.
That's easy.
I was worried I would draw swabbing the decks, Which is far more difficult than remaining quiet.
You're failing at your job right now.
Says you.
Says the definition of shut up.
Yeah.
I need to get off this boat.
Gus, don't be leon from the like of prayer video Or anything, for that matter.
We might actually get to see a whale.
Fine.
But after the whale.
Hey.
You're on chum duty, princess.
Nice.
All right, magician, where do we go?
Well, uh, sharks are very unpredictable, you know, Silent, but deadly.
If it is he who smelt it, Then It is also he who-- Who most likely dealt it.
What the hell are you talking about?
Uh These attacks occur under conditions Determined by a number of different variables-- Air and water temperature, time of year, currents, And they're anything but random.
I am sensing a number of variables here-- Uh, air and water temperatures, currents, the time of year.
The shark is definitely in a pattern.
Are you a biologist or a psychic?
well The reef!
Yes.
I can see it, the reef.
There is a harem of seals gathered there to mate And make succulent fondues.
The shark is also there Waiting.
I know that spot.
A pod seals has been settled in the area.
You might be worth something after all.
Ha!
But I believe it's a It is a harem of seals.
Ah!
I've heard it both ways.
Hang in there, buddy.
okay, we need to find out What kind of protest stunt pavan pulled In order to get himself accidentally eaten by a shark.
Maybe it wasn't a stunt.
Maybe it wasn't even an accident.
Maybe we jumped off murder too soon.
You with spencer on this now?
Come on, o'hara, I just got my head back on straight.
Look at this letter I found in the courier from last month.
The courier?
No.
I would rather french-kiss a hobo Than read anything in that rag.
Wow.
A simple "I don't like the writing" Would have made your point.
I'm sorry, o'hara--that paper is not allowed in this station.
So you're going to ignore a clue Because you don't like a reporter?
Hate.
Hate is the word, o'hara, And, yes, no good can be found in that paper, Except maybe the obituary for reporter chad gorsuch.
- Really?
- An untimely death-- Self-inflicted and painful.
Later to be referred to as gor-suching yourself.
No!
He's on a respirator and dying slowly!
Oh, that was very therapeutic.
I actually feel quite better.
What do you got?
It's an open letter to "the criminal fishing industry Of santa barbara".
It's fancily worded and a little rambling, But it basically says, "stop your illegal fishing practices, Or I will".
So he was taking on the whole industry?
- Question is- -who was he going after first?
Move faster, you pantywaist!
Time's wasting!
There's 200 other lines in the water right now!
Oh, that is really gross, huh?
You need to take over.
- I can't do that.
- Why not?
I've got to have one hand free to do this.
Ask tanner to do it.
- He says he has a bad wing.
- What the hell does that mean?
I don't know!
I don't speak salty fisherman.
What's going on down here?
We're right over the reef.
I need more, psychic.
Well, I need, uh, quiet Is what I need.
Is there a bed in there that I can lay down on And a pillow that doesn't smell like fish?
What the-- I'm also gonna need a little boy's room.
* chum, chum * - Hello?
- Hey, dad, help me out here.
I need the number for that doctor lady.
- Shawn, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
Shawn Okay, fine, it, uh- -it rhymes with pfark punting.
Shawn, please tell me That you're not going after that shark.
I just need to talk to your lady friend.
- Well, you can't.
- Why not?
She's in the bathroom.
- She's there?
- Yes.
of course she is.
Fine.
It's fine.
Have her tell you through the door Where the shark is, Because inside its belly is evidence in a murder case.
Shawn, I'm hanging up.
No, no, no, wait a sec.
Dad, dad, dad, dad.
Just tell her to give me a phrase, Just a phrase--anything.
Something that sounds oceanographery-ish.
Good-bye.
Dad.
That figures.
What do we got?
We got, uh We got maps, Charts, things with Longitude and all the 'tudes!
Oh Bull's-eye, bull's-eye, bull's-eye.
Dante pavan, he's an ocean activist nut job from seattle.
It's jagged Like a tooth mark.
A knife would have to have many of the characteristics Of shark teeth, like this What are you still doing down-- Shh.
I know who the killer is.
Who?
We're on his boat.
- How do you know tanner-- - shh!
how do you know tanner is the killer?
Tanner has a stack of violation As deep as the ocean floor.
Pavan was an activist, remember?
Tanner is just the kind of old-school violator That he was railing against.
That's just circumstantial.
- Who are you, lassiter?
Wh- -what about these?
- Shark-toothed knives?
- Exactly!
One of those could have made that wound.
Wait a second Where's the medium one?
- Exactly, gus- - where is the medium one?
It's missing.
You want to know why?
Because tanner used it to Kill pavan.
That's nothing but a wild guess.
It fits somehow, gus.
That's why lassiter's always a half a step behind us, Because we follow our instincts, And your first instinct is pure, And you got to grab it- hey, shawn!
I got him!
I got the son of a bitch!
Don't just stand there- help me haul it in!
Guster!
Dynamite.
Get that dynamite!
Are you crazy?
We're taking this thing in.
No, we're not.
We're gonna destroy it before it destroys us!
Now go!
Surface tissue With completely different dna.
Shark must have had this tissue wedged in his teeth When he chomped down on this poor guy.
You were the other victim, weren't you, tanner?
Come again?
That shark took a bite out of you.
It was your tissue weed in his teeth With your dna.
Yeahyou've been in trouble with various regulatory agencies For years, but you wouldn't change.
Dante pavan tried to stop you once and for all.
That's why you killed him in a struggle, Got rid of the evidence the best way you knew how-- Drawing a shark in to devour the body, Stab wound and all.
But somehow, the shark got the knife And a piece of you too.
When they caught that first shark, You stole it and sliced him open 'cause you thought the only evidence That could bring you down was stuck in its belly.
But it was the wrong shark!
And you're not gonna stop until you find the right shark And get rid of the evidence inside of him for good.
Forget this!
What the hel are you doing, boy?
You're finished, tanner.
Oh, I think this is gonna get messy.
I'm the one with the knife, man.
Oh!
If that shark couldn't take me down, I don't think you And the retching pantywaist Here will--aah!
That's for calling me a pantywaist.
There's no shame in having a gag reflex.
It's a sign that I'm highly evolved.
I did a bit of research, and what I found was-- Gus, he's out cold.
Oh.
It was nice, though.
Do you have any idea how to drive this thing?
Lassie.
I'll be needing a favor from you.
Will you please make sure That the chief gets one of these?
Well, of course I'll make sure she gets one of these.
I promise.
You know, I don't write the headlines, But if I did, I probably would have added And does so with foppish aplomb.
You know that's right.
If you take time to read the article, You'll see that we did you justice.
It should effectively quash All that detective dipstick talk.
Except in our office, of course.
But you wouldn't begrudge us that.
I just wanted to say You were this close, man.
You were right there at the precipice.
You were next to us.
But you wouldn't jump.
So Do these accolades feel good?
Yes, they do.
But it should be you right there with us On the front page.
- Behind me.
- Right behind gus.
Not because you're any less important.
But because you're a little bit taller.
And because maybe you're slightly less important.
You know what?
The press can write whatever they want.
I'm over it.
Seriously, I don't want to be you, Not for one minute.
I don't want to throw out five crazy theories Just to get one right.
I am a police detective, And police detectives do not surmise That banks are knocked over By groups of angry cats with laser beams.
I never said they were angry.
They were simply following orders.
Regardless, at the end of the day, I do good police work, and people respect me for it.
- Name two.
- Name one.
If you'll excuse me, I have matters.
Matters?
It means leave before I get rude.
- Oh!
- Oh, come on, now.
I think we're past that.
Judges?
- Concur.
Out.
- Bye, lassie.
- See you later, buddy.
Here.
Hey!
Since when do you have a key?
I don't.
Since when do you not lock your doors?
I'm just looking for some sunscreen.
We're going out on the water, And I need a little protection from the sun And kim's smile.
Nothing less than spf 50.
Oh, your dad is one silver-tongued devil, shawn.
He most certainly is, kim.
I think we do have some sunscreen In the other room, dad.
I'll show you where.
- All right.
Ah.
Let me just say That I'm very happy to see that things Are going well with you anyour doctor lady friend.
She seems very nice.
Looks like you have a good thing going.
Good luck.
Well, thank you, son.
And truthfully, I do like her a lot.
But I'm not forgetting I'm a fisherman at heart, And there's still a lot of marlin out there.
And she could lead me right to them.
That's crafty.
See ya later, alligator.
alli--alligator?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Male announcer: Last season on psych Mr. Yang is the most notorious killer This city has never seen.
He only resurfaces when he feels There's a worthy opponent.
That is mary lightly.
He's very familiar with the patterns of our killer.
Question regarding the whole mary thing.
My father's name was mary, His father before him was named mary, And his father before him was named craig.
I forbid you to be a part of this, shawn.
This guy knows about you.
He knows about everybody you care about.
He's got my mom.
This switch has such a light touch, And then boom!
You're gonna rot in a cell With four padded walls-- the end.
No, I'm gonna write a book.
Our story.
Guess I have to find a new hobby.
Tours, racquetball.
That could work.
All right, shawn, last chance.
You really want to do this on a Friday night?
The little mermaid.
Without gus?
Yeah, apparently gus has a strange aversion To rene auberjonois.
It's a benson thing.
You really want to see this flick?
Dad, don't say "flick".
And I'm barely tickling adolescence.
Why do you want me to grow up so fast?
All right, listen, shawn, I know the running time.
I'm gonna be back here in exactly 116 minutes.
Awesome.
Bye, dad!
Is that you?
Oh, 'scuse me.
Just hurry.
Oh, ahem.
Just kiss the knees in a touch, guys.
Thanks.
You're very sweet, both of you.
Your drink.
I'm-- That's my bad.
I'm sorry.
That's just awk-- awkward.
Where have you been?
You missed the first third of the movie.
Let me guess, Dude has a creepy voice And a mommy complex.
All I care about is the shower scene.
Wait for iiit Aah!
Did you know that hitchcock appeared In all of his films?
Everyone knows that.
But did you know that he was also obsessed With women's japanese household slippers?
Wore them everywhere, even to bed.
- That's not true.
- No, it's not.
It's part of a new bit I'm working on Called completely random, untrue trivia.
MaryLightly.
You guys like pie?
* ooh, baby, it's true * When I was nine years old, My mother gave me my first haircut.
Here's your milk, doll face.
Thank you.
Mary, you seem disturbed.
Even more so than usual.
I'm almost afraid to ask, but why don't you tell us What's really on your mind?
I'm assuming you've read this.
Are you kidding?
We're in it.
If I'm not mistaken, and I am paraphrasing here, I'm introduced on page 11 As a thick-tufted boy genius who ice skates through life On polished blades of snarky eloquence.
That is an exact quote, shawn.
Do you remember what I was described as?
Laughing on the outside, crying on the inside, The fastidious wrinkle on the brow of psych.
True, but she also said You had skin of pure cocoa velvetiness.
She also she would like to use that skin To make children's dolls.
I'd buy that doll.
The point is, shawn, you know yang Almost as well as I do.
You're the only other person who would know That none of this is possible.
Come on, shawn, the projectionist.
We didn't get to the drive-in till 11:26.
How would yang have had the time to do all that And strapped your mother down with incendiary explosives?
Look, mary I know that yang was a big part of your life.
But she is behind electronic gates now, And she can't hurt anyone anymore.
Yang wasn't working alone.
You didn't give racquetball a fair shake, did you?
I will not wear short pants, shawn.
I think it's time for you to go home, mary.
Yes.
I am home.
I live here.
Say what?
I never left santa barbara.
I've been here since we caught yang.
No, no, no!
You should have told us.
We would have gotten you a house chilling gift.
A belated welcome to you, and forever good-bye.
Don't do, shawn.
You will regret it.
Good luck at the creepy arm grab awards This year, mary.
I think you have a real shot At winning.
Shawn, thanks for coming out here.
We think that this just happened, So if there's anything to get psychically, I wanted you to take a look while things are still fresh.
What happened?
It isn't pretty.
The victim's a caucasian female, Approximate age, mid-40s.
Strangled, Dropped here like a sack of potatoes.
Body's still warm.
I know.
What's the matter, guster?
Forget your crime scene pills?
Gus?
Do you know this woman?
She served us our pie.
What the hell does that mean-- She served you your pie?
ShawnWhat is it?
* I know you know * * that I'm not telling the truth * * I know you know * * they just don't have any proof * * embrace the deception * * learn how to bend * * your worst inhibitions * * tend to psych you out in the end * * I know you know * All right, mary, you were the last customer In this place last night.
What do you remember seeing?
Nothing-- she brought gus's milk, And I never saw her again.
I couldn't even find her to pay the bill.
Wait, you didn't pay the check?
So what happened to my $20?
I folded it into a tiny sailor's hat For a special friend.
Ahh.
Uhh!
Here we go.
It's yang.
She's in jail.
Indeed, this is the work of yin.
Back off, this can get sticky.
Okay What is that?
Crossword puzzle.
It's from yesterday's paper.
There's two clues highlighted.
"A good man is hard to blank.
Blank, myself, and I." I got it!
A good man is hard to find.
Me, myself, and I. The answer is "find me".
I think that bailiff from night court Is spot-on.
Perfect, we can start by-- No, jules, we don't start, period.
You guys want another crime scene?
You want another dead body?
Go ahead, engage.
But we can't play this game again.
Oh, spencer, I wish I had the luxury Not to follow a lead in a murder investigation.
Fine, you do what you have to do.
Gus and I are going straight to the source.
What?
Mary You coming or what?
Solitary confinement in a mental institution?
Feels redundant.
Gus?
I smell crazy.
I crave sweet, sweet mushrooms.
And why are we wearing these?
It's a preventative measure.
She gets overly stimulated by color.
What about my face?
Shawn.
I knew you'd come.
She's cute, right?
I got the googley eyes for her, But she's playing hard to get.
Okay, I can't stand it any more.
What did you think of the book?
Honestly?
I thought bruce campbell's was better.
We're here to ask you one, simple question.
The answer is yes, shawn, They do allow conjugal visits.
But I think we'd have to get married first.
I am a fully-ordained minister.
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard.
Mary here seems to think that you are not The sole mastermind behind this nasty venture.
I don't think, shawn, I know.
Do you, mary, quite contrary?
Do you now?
Okay, shawn.
I think we can help each other out.
This isn't silence of the lambs, okay?
It's totally silence of the lambs.
That makes you frankie faison.
- I know.
- Fine.
We're gonna catch this sicko with or without you.
I just thought I'd give you one shot at redemption.
Make no mistake, you're going to hell either way.
Speak now, or we're out of here.
See you.
Okay, Shawn!
I never said I didn't have a dance partner.
So there really is a yin to her yang.
If you think I'm sick, You ain't seen nothin' yet.
What are we doing here?
Retracing our steps.
We were here last night for the hitchcock festival.
It was a triple feature.
Guster, I don't care how many movies you saw.
Spencer, what the hell are we doing?
Shh!
There's two clues highlighted.
He was here!
He was sitting right there.
I think we were in the same row.
Well, then you must have seen him.
What did he look like?
- I Just hurry.
Oh, your drink.
I'mThat's my bad.
I don't--I don't know.
There's something here.
"oh, shawn, don't cry over spilled soda.
"but, tsk tsk, you were 20 minutes late, So now you'll have to play catch-up".
You two need to go back and see yang.
No, she is not The puppet master anymore.
Okay?
Yin is working alone.
Well, then, mary, what can you tell us about yin?
What's his game?
There is no game.
It's the law of opposites, okay?
Yang had rules-- the ticking clock, The keen rhyming schemes, nothing but order.
Yin, nothing but chaos.
And you can bet your sandy bottom That as soon as you figure out the rules, They'll change.
Let's go to thmovies!
Seriously, not again, guster.
I'm not gonna watch you act like a court jester For a second round of this nightmare.
The necktie around the waitress-- That's straight out of frenzy.
I mean, we're clearly dealing in themes and motifs.
Him knowing we were here last night, Our clues are gonna be found in hitchcock films.
That's very good, gustus.
Okay, we've got a lot of cinema to cover.
Gus and I'll take the cannonball run series.
Mary, you take hooper through stroker ace.
Those are burt reynolds movies.
Well, we really have our work cut out for us then.
Think, shawn, think.
Try and find something.
You didn't see his face, But you can pick up on something.
You can do it, shawn.
The feet, the shoes.
Something.
Spencer!
I'm cold!
And hurry up.
We don't have all night.
- You can do it, shawn.
- Come on.
Focus.
Think.
See something.
Show me your face!
Look at me!
Come on, shawn, the projectionist.
We didn't get to the drive-in till 11:26.
How would yang have had the time to do all that?
Come on, shawn.
It's me.
It's always been me.
I don't think we're speaking to the mouse.
The mouse is speaking to you.
I don't think, shawn.
I know.
Shawn.
Shawn!
Look what happened to our window.
Gus I know who yin is.
Mr. Spencer, this is outlandish.
Just hear him out.
Mary lightly all but confessed To gus and I when he said that he had spent The last 13 years of his life with yang And had no idea what he was going to do without her.
Mr. Spencer, I have to ask Why are you just now receiving these psychic signals?
Why didn't you tag mary as a suspect The last time around?
He did.
It was the first thing he said when he saw him.
Oh, he was just being flippant and jackassy.
Look, I think our track record speaks for itself.
We can either do this together, Or we can follow you around And conduct our own investigation.
All right, mr.
Spencer.
But you're on a very short leash.
How do you suggest that we proceed?
Keeping in mind, of course, We haven't a shred of physical evidence.
We do nothing.
Nothing?
How seinfeldian.
Chief, we let him hang himself.
We keep him close, we play along.
We catch him red-handed.
Ahem.
HelloMary.
Well, I got yin's next clue.
I found it on my doorstep, Along with a can of matizallego sarnes In olive oil.
It took ever ounce of willpower I had Not to open them up.
Sweet.
Sock it to us.
"take 39 steps by 12:05.
"wait for iiiit.
"coordinates north by northwest.
Make a wish".
Wait for what?
More hitchcock.
No, it's just a motif.
Try to think through it, chief.
Okay?
He's showing off.
We're all ears, lightly.
You really are all ears, carlton.
Spectacular.
Well, I've delivered this clue, And I suggest that we all think about it analytically.
Okay, northwest, northwest.
Northwest mall, northwest air.
Northwest Park and picnic.
- That's it.
- What?
I play dominoes with some jamaicans there on sundays.
There's a set of stairs that leads up to a penny fountain.
"make a wish".
Okay, we have less than a half hour.
Mr. Lightly, you ride with my detectives.
Let's go!
- We'll be right behind you!
Come on, we're taking a detour.
We're close.
His house should be right here.
That's it.
That's the address.
Damn, mary.
I think mary would want you to have a can or two.
Shut up, shawn.
Dude, it's ben!
Dude, he wasn't kidding.
That hat belongs in my wallet, shawn.
What's with all the numbers?
It's pi.
Gus, don't be topher grace Running on the beach at the end of good company.
The value of pi, shawn, as in mathematics.
Oh, right, with the--yeah.
Do we like pi, he asks.
This dude has problems.
Uhh!
Quick.
Arrest that fat kid.
There's no time.
No, there's less than a minute.
Damn it, mary, come on!
What are you wearing, ankle weights?
Of course I am!
I've got a thigh spasm!
It burns so deep, you guys!
Ohh!
Go on without me!
Damn it.
What do you think?
Just come on, mary!
Dude, a ticket stub.
He was definitely at the movie theater.
He sure was.
Um Gus.
Oh, hell, no.
It's 12:05 on the dot.
What the hell are we supposed to be looking for?
I don't Wait.
I think I have something.
That's the north line.
"north by northwest".
That's him!
Where the hell is mary?
Son of a bitch!
Mcnab!
What is it?
"it's time we met in the flesh, don't you think"?
It's his next move.
He's just working out the wording.
"736 la porte avenue, industri lane.
"curtain's at 9 p.M. Come alone".
Who is it for?
His next victim.
Mcnab, do not tell me that!
Someone on that bus must have seen something.
Hey!
What happened?
Where were you?
Cut the crap, mary!
Start talking!
Didn't you see at the bus stop?
It was him!
I tried to stop him, I tried, but it was too late.
He was wearing a Very stylish fedora.
Yeah, we know.
We got off on the next stop.
We must have missed him by a matter of seconds.
Of course you did.
He knew exactly how much time it would take.
He probably rehearsed it 100 times.
He totally manhandled me.
I dropped my shoe.
Spencer where the hell are you?
Yeah, well, thanks for nothing.
Is shawn okay?
He's fine.
His tire blew.
Get in the car.
Shawn, are you sure this is where we're supposed to be?
Ahem, absolutely.
This is one of the strongest visions I've had in years.
"736 la porte avenue, industrial lane".
I saw this place, I saw mary's face, I saw his watch.
Look at that.
It's show time.
Let's bag this degenerate.
You two stay put.
Of course it's locked.
I'm gonna take the east exit.
- Copy that- - I'll head around back.
Take it from behind.
Let's try and keep this p. G. Rated.
Damn it, spencer, I told you to stay in the car.
I think he's probably keeping an eye on that door.
We know--we're gonna walk the perimeter.
Go back to the car.
This door opens, or you see anything That doesn't look right, honk the horn.
Go, now!
Okay.
Shawn, what are you doing?
Uh-uh, shawn.
We're out of here.
We're locked in.
What are we looking at?
I don't care, shawn.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
What are you up to, mary?
Oh, dude, I'm getting serious deja vu right now.
Wait a minute.
Oh, my gosh.
He's gonna shoot somebody, shawn.
He has a gun.
OhNo.
Gus This is psycho!
We were wrong!
Mary is the victim.
Mary!
Get out of here!
Ohh!
Gah!
There's gotta be a way out of this room!
Gus.
Mary!
What Oh!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, gus.
The clue was meant for him.
I don't understand.
What about the notebook?
All recreations.
Not first drafts!
I should-- I should have told you guys, but I wanted to be heroic.
Ah, mary.
With a flare gun?
I was really counting on the element of surprise.
There Spencer, what the hell happened?
There!
He was right there!
Could you take care of ben?
HeyYou hang on.
There's help on the way.
Do you think they have racquetball in heaven?
I know they do.
You're interrupting my exercise time, shawn.
I only get 45 minutes a week.
Aside from shock treatments, This is all I have to look forward to.
That and hell.
Roll it back, reginald!
Who the hell is she talking to?
Look, your partner wore ankle weights To throw me off.
I was wrong about mary.
I know.
Such a shame.
My lady guard friend told me.
Please don't beat yourself up, shawn.
The guy creeped me out.
This was an honest mistake.
Look, we need your help.
Oh, little brooding brown one.
I've already given you all the help you need To catch yin.
How?
You just seem bat s. Crazy to me.
NeverJudge a book by its cover.
No matter how sexy that picture might be.
Give me the book.
Shawn, I read this book cover to cover.
I've pored over it.
Cover to cover.
What?
Look at that.
Nice.
She drew a self-portrait just for you.
But what does it mean?
Chief Yin sent another clue.
We have the address.
The time will be 9:00 p.M. He wants you all to show up there, Where he has created his own movie set.
I'm done watching movies, chief.
Exactly, detective.
You now are the movie.
He's cast you all as archetypal characters From hitchcock's canon.
There will be clues that lead you to catching him, Based on the plots of those films.
You serious about this?
We're just supposed to play dress-up all night?
We will do whatever it takes, detective.
He is giving us an opportunity to catch him Before he kills again.
Now, I'm not sending you in there like sitting ducks.
He's made it very clear that you are to come alone.
But the only way that this is going to work Is if I set up a team on the outside And cover the perimeter.
Snipers?
You bet your ass.
Karen I got your message.
What can I do?
He's called you out, henry.
You have a history with him as well.
Sean connery?
Dad, you can say no.
Shawn, the last time this happened, You put your life on the line.
We almost lost your mother.
I'm gonna be right by your side, son.
End of discussion.
All right, people.
This ends tonight.
All right, chief, no sign of human movement.
We're gonna gain a better vantage point.
Okay, proceed, but keep me posted As to your coordinates, And make sure that everyone is tuned in.
Snipers are in place and will go at my ready.
So no false alarms.
Wait a minute.
I think that's meant for me.
That scene from the birds-- Tippi hedren's attacked in the car.
What are you talking about, lassiter?
Didn't you see marnie?
Half that movie was me and tippi driving around in a car.
That clue is all me.
You do realize you're not actually sean connery, right?
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, I got lost for a moment there, Because I literally thought I was talking to rod taylor.
- Who's rod taylor?
- I am!
Look, stop.
We can't be sure.
You should both go and check it out.
"need a ride"?
It's clear.
All right, we're in the vehicle.
Watch yourself.
Well Well, look at that.
That's a wheelchair.
Up in that window there.
Shawn Ahem.
Sorry.
Looks like that's my clue.
Be careful.
Canada lee?
Lifeboat?
Do you see any water around here?
There wasn't even a puddle.
Yeah, I don't know how it fit into this either.
Uh, gus What?
Maybe it is just a prop.
There's no ignition, not even a place for a key.
Shawn This place is creepy.
I'm almost at the door.
Open it and then run away.
It's locked.
Yin in screwing with us.
What are you seeing?
Gus, it's rear window.
I can see all of you.
I can see everything.
The Question is, what actually matters?
Jules!
That's ernie's bar from vertigo!
Kim Novak.
This is me, Shawn.
I'll signal everyone if there's anything.
Proceed with caution, detective.
We're in a tunnel now.
How the hell's he doing this?
- Ahh!
- Ow!
What is--what is that?
Juliet!
GusWhat are you doing in here?
We can't see you in here.
That music is playing so loud, we can't hear anything.
Stay where you are.
I have a clue.
"draught us a couple cold ones, and let's make a toast To you falling head over heels for me".
GusRelax.
It's why we're here.
I'm going to do this.
Juliet!
Talk to me.
Talk to me, gus!
Juliet!
Cover your eyes!
I'm gonna shoot out the window!
Juliet!
Spencer!
O'hara, somebody-- come in.
What happened?
Car was a trap!
We lost contact.
Something happened in the bar!
Juliet!
Juliet!
I know this is hard.
We're ready to take the call when it comes in.
There's nothing more we can do.
It's my fault.
Dammit, spencer, this is not your fault.
Detective o'hara was my responsibility.
That tunnel wasn't on any of the schematics, And the son of a bitch knew it.
There's no way we could have known.
Unless you're a psychic.
Shawn I just spoke with your mother.
I wanted her to know that you were safe.
She's fine.
She's at a hotel in new york at a conference.
I told her to stay put.
Shawn Doesn't abigail get in tonight?
Oh, my god.
What time is it?
It's almost 1:00.
Her flight gets in in half an hour.
We can't afford to let you go.
Shawn, what happens if a call comes in And we need to be somewhere halfway across the city In 11 minutes?
I have to pick her up.
Don't worry.
We'll send someone to get her.
Someone she knows.
Mcnab!
How was uganda?
It was rich, compelling, a must-see.
What is this about, buzz?
Can't really say.
I'm just here to make sure you get home safely.
Why wouldn't I be safe?
This is ridiculous, and I am beyond jetlagged.
Just tell me what is going on.
Please, ms.
Lytar.
Just following my orders.
"ms.
Lytar"?
Really?
Buzz, what are you doing?
Oh, my god!
Are you okay?
Buzz!
Somebody help me!
No!
It's Abigail.
Hey, abs, sorry I couldn't pick you up myself.
Hello, shawn.
I have good news and bad news.
The good news is That our femme fatale Is still very much alive.
The bad news, for you anyway, Is that I have now met the girl next door.
I understand your predicament.
They're both so you.
But we can't have our cake and eat it too.
So I'm doing you a favor here By forcing you to choose.
Choose?
Yes, shawn.
Who do you care about more?
Because you can't save them both.
Mcnab is okay.
He didn't get a look at yin.
You want something from the snack machine?
You know, they have bugles.
This is it!
This is it!
What is the clue?
What's the clue?
Shawn, I'll drop by half past 4:00.
My hands are on my face.
Please come quick, or this could be messy.
Shawn, you can still save abigai-- "hands on my face".
it's a clock.
Half past four, this could get messy.
"I'll drop by".
She's kim novak in vertigo.
"I'llDrop by".
- Instead of a bell tower - It's a clock tower.
It's the clock tower!
Detective, wait.
A civilian has been taken as well.
She must be given priority.
If we had the slightest clue-- You've got other units, chief.
I'll be going to get my partner now.
Detective!
Mr. Spencer, Can you tell us where abigail is?
I can't.
There's no way to save them both.
It's jules.
We know where she is, we follow lassie.
We save juliet.
Okay.
I'll drive.
Henry, go home.
Your role here is finished.
Not a chance in hell.
You, too, are a civilian, And therefore an unnecessary risk.
- All right, I accept.
- Excuse me?
The job--the job you offered me, karen.
I accept.
Cut me a little slack on the wardrobe.
It's great to be back.
Gus, wait.
The cover.
Yang didn't draw herself.
She drew abigail On the pier.
I think I know where she is.
Let's go get her.
No, no, no.
I could be wrong.
You go with the chief.
You help lassie.
Shawn, you're not going alone.
Gus, the only way that I can not be there for juliet Is if I know that you are.
And I won't be alone.
Boats.
All right, don't worry, son.
If she's here, we'll find her.
She's under the pier, isn't she?
I see you, sweetheart.
Blink once for yes, and two for no.
Are there any explosives that I can trigger By coming in?
Shawn!
Oh, you're kidding me!
Okay, take the stairs.
I'll man the point and set up a perimeter.
Hey.
- Hey.
We've really come full circle, huh?
This is where I stood you up on our first date.
Thanks for showing up this time.
Ahh.
Hey, abby.
How was your trip?
Awesome!

Please tell me you still carry your swiss.
Of course I do.
I taught you that.

You just concentrate on your breathing.
I promise not to try anything while I'm down there.
It's getting higher!
Hurry!

We're almost there.
O'hara!
My god.
All right, don't worry.

But I had to let him go.
You had no choice.
You did the right thing.
You know, this game isn't over.
I know.
Thanks for being there, buddy.
Uhh!
Juliet's okay.
Good.

Listen, you take care of your girl.
I'll go talk to the cops.

Yeah.
Oh, yeah, look at that.
God, yours is so much bigger than mine.
Wow.
Thanks.
Whew.

Okay, here goes.
I--I know this is probably a gut reaction To everything that we just went through.
But the fact that we are sitting here, I mean here, in this place, It h to mean something, doesn't it?
I mean, what if I said That I was willing to learn how to compromise?
Yeah, and meet you halfway On everything.
You make me laugh.
AndYou make me feel like I'm a little bit crazy.
And--and I know that if I just let myself, I could completely fall But there's a lot of things that I want to do, shawn.
I'm not just kindergarten teacher Who wants to settle down and make a family.
I want to-- I want to make a difference.
I want to inspire people.
And I can't do any of that If I'm dead.
You inspire me.
