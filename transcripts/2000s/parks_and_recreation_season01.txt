{START OF EPISODE 1}
Hello.
Hi.
My name is Leslie Knope, and I work for the Parks and Recreation Department.
Can I ask you a few questions?
Would you say that you are, "Enjoying yourself and having fun, "having a moderate amount of fun "and somewhat enjoying yourself, "or having no fun and no enjoyment"?
I'm gonna put a lot of fun.
Ms. Knope, there's a drunk stuck in the slide.
Sir, this is a children's slide.
You're not allowed to sleep in here.
What is?
LESLIE You know, when I first tell people that I work in the government, they say, "Oh.
The government.
The government stinks.
"The lines are too long at the DMV".
But now things have changed.
People need our help.
And it feels good to be needed.
Could you put your arms to your side?
Wait And that might help you slide down a little easier.
We don't Do you want to come this way?
Uh-uh.
Okay, we're gonna need you to get out.
Can you please go away?
Get out of the slide.
Okay?
You're Can you please go away?
Here we go!
Okay, wake up.
Here we go.
Out of the slide.
LESLIE You know, government isn't just a boys' club anymore.
Women are everywhere.
It's a great time to be a woman in politics.
Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, me, Nancy Pelosi.
We did it!
You know, I like to tell people, you know, "Get on board and buckle up, "because my ride's gonna be a big one.
" And if you get motion sickness, you know, put your head between your knees 'cause Leslie Knope's stopping for no one.
Tonight is our next monthly community outreach public forum.
And that is tonight.
That is tonight.
Right.
Leslie will be running it.
And we need one more.
Who wants in?
Tom.
Fine.
LESLIE This is a great thing for you guys to see.
This is where the rubber of government meets the road of actual human beings.
When I go through these doors, I need to be on.
Like the White House Press Secretary.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Okay.
Here we go.
It's locked.
Okay.
Here we go.
Thank you so much for coming.
What an amazing turnout.
My name is Leslie Knope.
I am the deputy director of the Parks and Recreation Department, and tonight we're gonna be taking some of your questions as Hello?
We're having a meeting in here.
Does anybody have any questions about permits?
So, take two.
I'm Leslie Knope, and with me is department member Tom Haverford.
We are here to answer any and all of your questions, so fire away.
Well, it's a great day, because last month they put me in jail.
That's right.
The head of the police is a ninth-degree Mason.
But the music is so loud.
Stop the graffiti, please.
Please.
I don't like obscenities just as much as you don't like them.
No, it drives me crazy.
I have kids.
Right.
But I've got my little three-year-old, I'm going through the park and someone's like, "Hey my " And the guy's, "You my, you head.
" These people are members of a community that care about where they live, so what I hear when I'm being yelled at is people caring loudly at me.
Now, I have a few things I want to say about Laura Linney.
Thank you so much, Barry.
Always great to have you here.
Anyone else who would like to contribute?
Hi.
Hi, hi.
Hi.
I'm Ann Perkins.
I'm a nurse, and frankly, I don't really care for politics, but I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street.
Excellent.
That sounds like a good idea.
Tell us about that.
No, it's a problem.
It almost killed my boyfriend.
Oh.
Yeah.
There's a lot nearby my house, and a developer dug out a basement for some condos, and then they went bankrupt, so there's just this giant pit, and it's been there for almost a year.
Twelve months, yes.
Go on.
Yeah, and my boyfriend, who is a musician, actually, I support him, but anyway, he fell in and broke both his legs.
Ann, let me speak with you for a minute.
So, your boyfriend fell down into this pit, right?
Yes.
And, this guy, is it pretty serious?
Are you guys living together?
Yes.
Wow, I'm sure this must be really tough for you.
You know, just, this guy, sounds like he didn't have a lot going on for him to start with, and now both legs broken.
He's just weak.
You have to take care of him.
You probably feel like you need to move on.
What does this Just become more adventurous in relationships with your body, just in Are you actually hitting on me right now?
Oh.
Oh.
God, no.
I'm not hitting on you.
I'm actually married.
I'm just an open person, and I like connecting with people.
I'm, you know, very comfortable around women, attractive women.
I've spent a lot of time with them.
And I just I don't know.
I feel like we might be taking up too much of the forum's time.
Maybe we can just exchange numbers.
You know, maybe go away one weekend and just kind of talk about this.
Look I'd love to do it.
The bottom line is I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and nobody's done anything, and it's ugly, and it's dangerous, and it's government-owned, and you need to do something about it.
Okay.
I'll do something about it.
Really?
Yes, we I will help you.
Is that a promise?
It's more than a promise.
It's a pinky promise.
I pinky promise all of you that I will help, and I will go to that location tomorrow, and we will fill in that pit, and then when that's done, we're gonna put a park on the land.
Okay.
LESLIE Well, I've worked at the Parks Department for six years, and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of.
Recently, I led a city-wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats.
But this pit, the chance to build a whole new park from scratch, this could be my Hoover Dam.
No, that sounds great.
Problem is, anything over $25 I have to report, so maybe give my wife a call and give her the suits, and then if they don't fit her, maybe she'll give them to me.
Morning.
All right, Mr. Mayor.
That sounds good.
I'll see you on Saturday for the Ultimate Frisbee game.
Bye.
Leslie, hello.
You were talking to the mayor?
Yep, we were just rapping about some things.
Tom and I work really well together.
We're both outsiders.
I'm a woman, he's a I think he's a Libyan.
I am from Bennettsville, South Carolina.
I am what you might call a redneck.
Okay, brainstorm.
How do we make this park happen?
Let's go to the city council directly and ask them to put up the money.
No, parks are not a priority.
I need more firepower.
I need bigger guns.
You know what I need to do?
Form a committee.
Right?
Yeah, that could work.
Yeah, 'cause committees are power, and committees make things happen.
Committees are the lifeblood of our democratic system.
That's really good.
Write that down.
Yep.
From time to time, when I think of an eloquent saying or a phrase, I have Tom write it down.
He's collecting them for my memoirs.
Here's Leslie's quote from Wednesday.
Okay, read it back to me.
Um "Committees cover our democracy with blood.
" Hmm.
Sounded better when I said it.
It's still good, though.
Okay, I have an idea.
What about bringing Mark on board?
Which Mark?
Which Mark?
Mark Brendanawicz.
Which Mark?
Well, if you want something done in this town, you call Mark Brendanawicz because, you know, he's a city planner, but he's more than that.
He's kind of like a fixer.
He fixes things.
He's a smart, capable guy.
He just He knows where the bodies are buried.
What's up, Brendanawicz?
You crazy old Polish person.
LESLIE City Hall is like a locker room, and you gotta get in there, and you gotta snap towels at people, and you gotta give them the business, and if you can't take it, you know, you Then you can't take it.
You gotta leave the locker room.
Let's get down to brass tacks.
I know you don't have a lot of time and I want to thank you for meeting me today.
I just work right there.
Well, thank you for clearing your schedule.
I didn't clear anything.
You know this lot that I'm talking about, right?
Yeah, Lot 48.
Condo developer.
He dug a basement, and then he went bankrupt.
I checked it out like a month ago.
It's pretty gross.
What would you say if I told you that I was thinking about turning it into a park?
A park, huh?
Okay.
Well, when I think about the logistics, the various hoops that you're gonna have to jump through, I would say, is it likely?
No, it's not likely, you know.
But, is it possible?
No.
It's not possible.
I would give up on that one.
What?
Why?
Why?
I don't know.
There's like a million reasons why.
Homeowners' associations, anti-government nuts, bureaucrats, miles of red tape Really?
It sounds like you're telling me to go for it.
There's no way it can happen.
I can do this.
I just need a little help.
Could you do me a favor, for old times' sake?
Mark and I It's complicated.
When you work closely with someone and you share similar interests and you have a similar world view and you're passionate about the same things, things can happen.
We slept together.
Leslie?
No.
Oh, my God.
You know what?
Yeah, we did, like, five years ago.
I sort of No, but yeah.
Yeah, we did.
Honey, can you straighten up your area a little bit?
'Cause they're gonna be here soon.
Can Thanks.
That parks lady is coming over, and we're gonna go take a look at the pit.
I think it's probably just a photo op for her.
I mean, I don't think anybody in government actually cares about Honey, do you mind doing that somewhere else?
I'm trying to watch TV.
I'm talking about the pit you fell in.
It's Ms. Perkins' house.
Doorbell!
Yeah, I heard it.
Doorbell!
I heard it.
I'm getting it.
I'm here.
Hey!
Wow!
Look at that.
Safety.
You remember Tom from last night.
Hey, Ann, how are you?
Yeah, hey.
Of course I do.
And this is our college intern, April.
She's going to be documenting our fact-finding mission.
Hey, April.
Hey.
Is this fun for you?
Yeah, it's so much fun.
I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.
Sorry.
This must be our hero.
The man heard 'round the world.
Uh-huh.
How you doing, son?
Pretty good.
I'm Leslie Knope.
And the entire government of Pawnee would like to let you know that we will do everything we can to help you.
Could you pass me my itch stick?
Of course.
So, Andy jumped over this fence.
He was crossing through to get home, and then he fell right there.
Oh, my God.
How did we let this happen?
Dream with me for a second, Ann.
Doesn't this neighborhood deserve a first-class park?
Imagine a shiny new playground with a jungle gym and swings, pool, tennis courts, volleyball courts, racquetball courts, basketball court, regulation football field.
We could put an amphitheatre over there with Shakespeare in the Park.
It's really not that big of a pit.
We could do some of those things.
It's gonna take a little extra work.
But why not try?
I think that would be great.
Me, too.
I'm going in.
Why?
Don't worry.
I have a hard hat on.
I can see that, but Yeah.
April, document this.
Document what?
The key to any fact-finding mission is to get right into the battle zone, you know?
It's like George Bush when he flew over New Orleans or Richard Nixon when he went to China to see what the Chinese were up to.
No!
Leslie, are you okay?
Leslie!
Hold on, April's gonna get some photos for the website.
Could you just be still?
Don't move around as much.
Okay, squeeze my fingers.
Good.
Does it hurt a lot?
No.
Mmm-mmm.
I'm fine.
No, you're not.
Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.
But it It fell off.
After my head hit that rod.
Wow.
I can't believe you fell in, too.
That's awesome.
It's not awesome, Andy.
Well, at least my boss will listen to me now that I broke my clavicle.
It's not broken.
It is.
Do you have one of those neck foam collar brace things?
Honestly, you're fine.
Honestly, my clavicle's broken.
Oh, hey, baby, if you're going to the kitchen, could you make me pancakes real quick?
Sure.
Ooh!
Are pancakes being made?
Thank you.
Sure.
I don't know, she's a little doofy, but she's sweet.
LESLIE Ron, please.
No.
No way.
Come on, Ron.
I've been a loyal foot soldier.
Give me my shot.
Let me have Lot 48.
Is that a travel pillow around your neck?
Ron, I don't know how to explain this to you.
When you've been down in the pit Have you been in the pit?
No, I haven't gotten down there yet.
Well, I have.
When you fell in.
When I visited the bottom of the pit on a fact-finding mission.
And when you're down there, you get some perspective about what it all means.
And let me tell you something, Ron.
What it means is I want this subcommittee.
I've been quite open about this around the office.
I don't want this Parks Department to build any parks because I don't believe in government.
I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money.
My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.
Like Chuck E. Cheese.
They have an impeccable business model.
I would rather work for Chuck E. Cheese.
Well, I will definitely think about it.
I like the sound of that definitely.
I'm gonna leave before you change your mind.
Mr. Swanson, I presume.
Lot Park?
Giving the park to me?
Still mulling.
RON She's insatiable.
She's like a little dog with a chew toy.
All right, you guys.
All right, all right.
I'll ask him.
Everybody wants to know what your decision is.
Someone on the phone about the park.
You know, I don't think I even want it.
Oh.
Man, my clavicle's still really hurting me.
Oh!
This is a great shot.
I know.
That's awesome.
I think she's crying in that one.
Look at this one.
Hey, kids.
That's another good one.
Hey.
Hey, Brendanawicz.
You gotta come check this out.
Leslie took us out to that pit in Lot 48, and she fell inside.
And we have some awesome photos.
One.
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's fine.
Oh!
This is a classic.
That's the best one.
The up-skirt photo.
Awesome.
Hey, man.
Give me the photo back.
What's going on?
Don't worry.
I can print more.
Leslie is unique.
Government work can beat you down.
I would say that I lost my optimism about government in about two months.
Leslie's kept hers for six years.
I've got a few rules about how to survive and prosper in a government job, and I think I'm about to break one of those rules.
I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie so she can try to build a park.
Why should I?
You owe me one, remember?
Do you want to cash in for this?
Yeah, I do.
LESLIE So this was built in And a little trivia, it is one of the first structures in America to ever have locks.
Wow!
Oh, yeah.
This is our crown jewel.
It's one of our best murals.
It depicts the very famous battle at Conega Creek.
We have a lot of children visit, so often we have to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster.
That is horrifying.
Yes, it is.
So, what do you want to see?
The DMV?
Animal control?
Or we could Leslie!
We did it.
Ron's approved our committee.
Oh, my God.
That's great!
That's so great.
That's so exciting!
This is huge.
I'm barely 34, and I've already landed a Parks Department exploratory subcommittee.
I'm a rocket ship.
Leslie.
I just heard the news.
Hey.
Isn't it great?
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'm so excited.
It's exciting, isn't it?
It is.
Yeah.
Should I call a press conference now, or Yeah, call one.
Definitely.
I would.
Every now and then we have these little gatherings, and Leslie gets plastered.
One time I convinced her to try to fax someone a Fruit Roll-Up.
She one time made out with the water-delivery guy in her office.
On Halloween, she was dressed up as Batman.
Not Batgirl.
Batman.
And I convinced her to go stop a crime that was going on outside.
And it is my favorite thing in the world.
You know what?
America is awesome.
It's so full of hope and small towns and big cities and real people and delicious beverages and hot guys.
You just never know when opportunity is gonna strike.
Yeah.
You gotta be ready for it.
Yeah.
Are you excited?
Definitely am.
Fired up.
Yeah!
I'm really fired up.
I You know they say that democracy or whatever only works when people get involved?
Well, I'm getting involved.
So I am gonna make a vow now that I will do whatever it takes to get this pit filled in.
Even if it takes two months.
Soul sista, soul sista Gonna get your phone, sista Yeah.
Sweet Lady Marmalard I've created this office as a symbol of how I feel about government.
This sawed-off shotgun belonged to a local bootlegger.
People who come in here to ask me for things have to stare right down the barrel.
Did you guys get a grant to do this?
This is my basketball court.
I don't want to see any double dribble.
I don't want to see any three-second violations.
Bobby Knight!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
LESLIE Well, one of the funner things that we do here in Pawnee is the annual Easter egg hunt.
Tom hides the eggs, and I have to say he did an exceptional job this year.
I've been searching for 25 minutes and I haven't found a single egg.
And I'm an adult.
Oh.
Yeah, I forgot to do that.
LESLIE Maybe Tom's trying to make this year a challenge.
And if so, he's succeeding.
I don't think a single egg has been found yet.
Let's keep looking.
We're gonna find one.
LESLIE I'm going to see my mom.
She's a big mucky-muck in the county school system.
She's my hero.
How do I explain her?
She's as respected as Mother Teresa.
She's as powerful as Stalin, and she's as beautiful as Margaret Thatcher.
In or out, Leslie.
Doorway is creepy.
Right, sorry.
Choosing in.
So, what do you want, Leslie?
Just here to gossip, gab, chat, stuff we do.
But it looks like you're super busy, and I am super busy, so I shall bid you adieu.
Oh.
That's weird.
I just remembered something.
I have my own subcommittee now.
Yeah.
I'm sure you've heard something about it.
People are talking about it.
No.
Oh.
Well.
Anyway, we're having a town hall meeting tomorrow at 7:00 p. m. At the Smithfield Community Center.
Mmm.
Yeah, I'm leading it.
It's no biggie.
I mean, it is.
It's a big deal.
I mean, I don't know.
You know You want to come?
Oh.
Honey, jeez.
You know how busy I am.
I know.
I know.
I know!
That's why I fake invited you.
I'll try to be there.
Okay.
So, everybody's here.
Let's get started.
Ow!
Sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Metal.
Sorry.
That's really loud.
Subcommittee members.
Are we prepared for tomorrow night?
Tom, have you booked the hall yet?
Yes, sir.
Ann, did you clear your schedule?
I did.
I changed my shift.
Okay.
Leslie, I just have to say, I think you might be taking this to the public a little bit too soon.
It literally doesn't matter what you propose to the public.
They might call for a vote, and if they vote you down, then you're done.
I don't care if there's gonna be a vote.
I have a secret weapon, canvassing.
Nothing better than good old-fashioned door-to-door campaigning.
I'm not above using my expertise to change hearts and minds if the cause is just.
When I was in sixth grade, I was voted Best Dressed by 87 votes.
And there were only Andy fell into that pit.
I fell into that pit.
How many more Pawnee citizens are gonna have to fall into that pit before we turn it into a park?
Zero.
Say it.
Zero.
Zero.
A hundred.
Zero.
I've got some sunscreen for your beaks.
Tom, you probably won't need any.
Uh And this is our canvassing guide.
This is gonna be the script that we use when we speak with people.
"If a person is a man, turn to page two.
" "If the person looks like a celebrity, example, Jack Nicholson, "use this to help your pitch.
"Example, 'You can't handle the pit.
"'That's why we need to turn it into a park.
"' Oh.
This is really thorough.
Ann and I are a team.
You guys are a team.
We have even sectors, you guys have odd sectors.
And we're gonna win.
Yeah.
Win what?
Go!
Okay.
Ooh, someone's in there.
This is gonna be fun.
Are you excited?
Excited, yeah.
Are you ready?
Yes, definitely.
Are you pumped up?
Yes!
Look humble.
But confident.
Good afternoon.
We are representatives from your local government.
May we speak with you for a moment about the Sullivan Street pit?
Sure.
Excellent!
Positive response.
How would you feel if we turned that pit into a beautiful community park?
Oh.
Yeah.
That'd be a great idea.
Oh.
Good.
I actually live in the neighborhood So I could probably tell you a little bit about That's Go to section three.
Okay.
Um We are having a public forum tomorrow night.
And it would be great if you could come, voice your strong support.
Tomorrow?
I can't.
I'm busy.
Sorry.
Oh.
Yes, we understand that people are busy, but we would love for you to come to the meeting and to Sorry.
Good luck, though.
I'm all for a park.
Would it change your mind if we told you that She's gone.
Yeah, a park, huh?
That sounds like a really good idea.
Great.
Would you be willing to come to a town meeting and show your support?
Absolutely.
Now, is this park gonna have a playground or, you know, maybe a pool for the kids?
Oh, how old are your kids?
No kids.
Uh-oh.
I'm gonna put him down as a yes.
Don't do that.
Also, is the park gonna be at least 1,000 feet from my house?
Because, you know, I really can't move again.
April, please stand behind me.
That's it.
That's all.
That's all we've got.
No flier?
Nope.
Okay.
Thank you.
Wow, man.
This is great.
This is so great.
I love canvassing.
What a great way to spend my time.
All right, Team Haverford.
You guys are awesome, but I think I might work better as a solo artist.
So, I'm gonna head out.
Peace.
He runs weird.
He really does.
It's a good idea.
But I'm just not sure.
Okay.
Which part are you not sure about?
Turning the pit into a park.
That's kind of the whole thing.
Well, look, I think this is a great idea, but I can't make any forum.
I would have to get a babysitter.
How old are your kids?
Four and two.
Could the 4-year-old watch the 2-year-old?
Okay.
Mickey!
What's up, buddy?
How's my number one sod man doing?
Look, here's the one, two, three of the situation.
One, we're building a new park, two, I'm on the committee, three, you're putting in the sod.
And who knows, you know?
Maybe, down the line, a situation will arise where you could hook me up.
Are you gonna commit to coming to this meeting tomorrow, or are you gonna be a bitch?
Yes, you do owe me.
Tom Haverford.
Okay.
Keep going, keep moving.
Nose to the grindstone.
No means yes.
Can we stop, please?
Because it's really hot, and I'm tired.
Yeah, I'm hot, too.
Let's blow on each other's faces.
Or we could drink some water.
Yeah, let's do that.
My house is really close by.
Let's just go take a break for an hour or so.
Okay, okay.
Look, I didn't want it to have to come to this, but, Ann, please open the sealed envelope that's in your binder.
This is a little something I learned from Karl Rove.
If you want to guarantee the results of a survey, you design the question to give you the answer that you want.
"Wouldn't you rather have a park than a storage facility for nuclear waste"?
That seems iffy.
Yeah, don't worry about it, I made it all up.
Yeah, that's what I mean.
Wouldn't you agree, like most decent Americans, that it would be a good idea to turn the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street into a beautiful community park?
Oh.
Actually, no.
I'm not really a fan of parks.
Very noisy, barbecue smell all the time.
Would you change your mind if I told you that nine out of 10 meth users said the same exact thing?
What?
How would you even know that?
Survey.
We surveyed crystal meth users.
We're actually having a little town meeting tomorrow night if you wanted to just Look, I know it sounds weird, but I just don't like living near parks.
So if you have a flier or something, I'd be happy to take it.
Thank you.
Okay.
You don't care about your kids if you don't support this park!
Excuse me?
It's What I mean is, kids love parks and you should, too.
So, if I don't support your little project, then I don't love my daughter?
I didn't What time is this thing, anyway?
Oh, it's next month, forget about it.
Oh, it's tomorrow night.
I'll be there.
Great.
Okay.
Come on.
We got one.
Come on.
Am I talking to the two sexiest thighs in landscaping?
Yes, I am, 'cause I'm talking to Marcy.
How's it going?
Tom Haverford.
Kevin, your sandboxes are the best.
That's why I want you involved!
I just want the best monkey bars I can get in my park.
I don't mind hooking you up.
Maybe, down the line, there'll be a situation where you can hook me up.
Thank you for your time, sir.
Hmm, he said some upsetting things.
I can't believe you gave him your home phone number.
Well, I'm a public servant.
I need to be accessible.
What the hell is wrong with people?
I should show them Andy's medical bills.
Maybe they'd have a little sympathy.
Oh, my God.
Ann!
Game changer.
You just busted the game wide open.
How?
Andy.
We need Andy.
He's our symbol.
We'll wheel him around the neighborhood to get sympathy.
He's a cute FDR.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Ron, you got a minute?
Uh, sure, Paul.
What can I do for you?
The Sullivan Street Park project.
You fast-tracked it, right?
Yeah, absolutely.
We have a public forum tomorrow.
Okay.
Great.
I'll be there.
Great.
Mmm.
"Hey!
You fast-tracked that, right"?
I'm sorry?
Did you say something?
Nope.
You didn't say anything to me?
Nope.
There's a new wind blowing in government and I don't like it.
All of a sudden, there's all this federal money coming in, and Paul, the city manager, is telling us to build parks and start new community programs.
It's horrifying.
Do you have, like, a nurse's costume?
Costume?
You mean, like, scrubs?
Yeah, put those on.
Okay.
Please tell me Please tell me why My car is in the front yard Bass!
Come on.
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on I came in through the window last night It can be tricky dealing Don't LESLIE Why do I want to build this park so bad?
Maybe because a pit filled with garbage isn't the best that we can do in America.
You know, in Russia, they could pretend that pit was a park, bring their kids down there.
"Hey, Vlad!
Look at these rocks!
"Let's pretend they're potatoes"!
"Nikolai!
Do you want to swim in the dirt"?
But not here.
Okay?
'Cause we're a nation of dreamers.
And it is my dream to build a park.
That I one day visit with my White House staff on my birthday.
And they say, "President Knope, this park is awesome.
"Now we understand why you are the first female President of the United States.
" Leslie Knope, builder of parks.
How was canvassing?
Canvassing was okay, but I think we're gonna have to postpone the town meeting.
Postpone?
Only for one to 90 days.
No.
You're doing this meeting.
You have my full support.
I was talking to the city manager, exchanging ideas.
Um, there's a mutual respect there.
And together, we have decided to fast-track your project.
City manager?
Wow.
Really?
I have to cancel this meeting.
Fast-track?
Did my name come up at all?
Oh, this meeting needs to be canceled.
No, it's happening.
Look, just do a good job tomorrow.
Okay?
We have to push this thing through.
Of course.
Of course.
I'll push anything through anything.
You know me.
Are you sweating through your suit?
I doubt it.
It's a very breathable fabric Oh, yeah.
I am.
Jerry, what's up, man?
Hey, you're into pretzels, right?
Bam!
Hit them up, man.
Thanks for coming down.
I got a seat taped off for you over there.
My top priority with this park, getting your fences in there.
I drove by one of your fences the other day.
I was like, "Man, that fence looks awesome.
" I was like, of course, Roy's.
If you're into chocolate muffins, grab as many you want.
TOM Some people may say that bringing in these contractors this early is jumping the gun a little bit.
Well, guess what?
Here's the gun, here's me.
Boom!
Victor Miles.
Tom Haverford.
How are you?
Thank you so much for coming down.
I want to introduce you to Leslie.
Victor Miles.
Hi.
He's a gentleman I met canvassing.
He also happens to be the top sod guy in Indiana.
That's terrific.
Hey, Leslie.
Hey.
I really want you to nail this.
Don from Don's Cement.
Tom Haverford.
Good to see you.
I was thinking of a jingle for your company.
How's this?
Don's cement It's the best you can get Don's I'm so glad you're here.
Yeah.
Andy came, too, to give his support.
I have a lot of stage experience, so This will be fine, right?
It's a park for God's sakes.
How much can they hate a park?
A lot of them seemed to hate a park yesterday.
April.
April, I need you in the audience.
Okay.
Wait, and if the questions start getting negative, I'm gonna call on you.
And I need you to sell the crap out of the park.
Can you do that?
Why?
Please, April!
This is serious!
Can you do that?
Probably.
Good girl, good girl, good "probably.
" Good girl.
Okay, here we go.
Line up, everybody.
My mom's here.
My mom's here.
My mom's here.
No.
I can't do that.
That's illegal.
Thank you so much for coming out tonight.
This is our first town meeting about the proposal to turn Lot 48 on Sullivan Street into a community park.
Yeah!
This is gonna be a train wreck.
I want my daughter to be successful, which is why I always tell her, "There's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother.
" Now, there are many people that I spoke to who are passionately in support of this idea.
None of them were able to make it tonight, unfortunately.
But they totally exist.
I did not make them up.
Oh, I see a question.
Okay.
No, no.
No.
No questions right now.
My name is Kate Spivack.
Mmm-hmm.
I remember you.
And I live in the neighborhood.
And I am 100% against this park.
I cannot believe the department is moving forward with a project without a single environmental impact study, and if you guys agree with me, let's take a stand.
LESLIE Okay.
We are a little ahead of schedule, because we're holding this town hall meeting so soon, which I was warned about by Mark Brendanawicz, our city planner assigned to this project.
Uh So what would he say?
Here we are.
Leslie, should I give them some background info on the site?
Absolutely.
Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz knows the answer to every question.
He's amazing and congratulations for hearing him speak.
Hi there.
Leslie might have oversold me a little bit.
Certainly did not.
He's the man.
He's capable of anything.
Okay.
Lot 48 is It's a rectangular lot.
It's got excellent drainage.
And it's on the corner of Sullivan and Collins.
Any questions?
I have more of a comment than a question.
Go for it.
It's for the guy in the casts.
Here we go, Lawrence.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That is Andy Dwyer.
He is a local resident and he tragically fell in the pit.
Uh, yeah.
I don't care about any of that.
He's the guy that plays music all night in his garage.
It's driving me nuts.
Lawrence lives with his grandma.
Which is pretty awesome.
He takes care of her, I guess.
But whatever, he's a douchebag.
It's loud, it's abusive, and it's waking up my birds.
You have birds, now?
Yeah, I have birds.
I have nice, pretty, expensive birds, and you play that music, and it wakes them up.
Look, I don't work for the government, okay?
Uh, I do play rock and roll.
Guilty as charged.
I'm in a band.
It's called Just the Tip.
And actually, if anyone here plays bass, we need a bassist.
Yes.
Okay, let's take a five-minute break, shall we?
Uh.
It is not going well at all.
Mmm-hmm.
It's going very poorly.
Okay?
Mmm-hmm.
Like, you're crashing and burning.
Democracy's happening.
People are talking.
I mean, at least they aren't apathetic, right?
You're right about that.
They're deeply negative.
You need to put a happy face on this, give me a few positive talking points, and whatever you do, avoid a vote.
I'm oddly attracted to Kate Spivack.
Before we continue, I'd love to just give you a little history of Pawnee.
The City of Pawnee was incorporated in 1817, when a young man by the name of Reverend Luther Howell came from Terre Haute on an ox.
He planted his flag in the ground and was met soon after by an angry tribe of Wamapoke Indians, who, when seeing the whiteness of his skin, twisted him to death.
Flash forward to 1969.
Man walks on the moon.
Pawnee is lousy with hippies My, God.
She's filibustering her own meeting.
Filibuster!
Boom!
They can't touch you if you talk forever.
I can't speak of the future, but I will.
The future of Pawnee will involve us flying around in space taxis, where we will communicate on watches, and blink our feelings to each other, rather than use words.
And now, I'd like to take a magical journey through a little something I like to call The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster.
Excuse me?
Can't you read that children's book on your own time?
I have the floor!
"There once was a boy named Milo, "who didn't know what to do with himself, not just sometimes, but " Okay, all right.
You know what?
This is a public forum, which means that we all get to tell you what we think.
Well, you did already talk, ma'am.
And I would love to listen to someone else.
Someone I don't know.
Uh That girl over there with the long brown hair and the yellow top.
Could you tell us how you feel about this park?
Go ahead.
Hi.
Uh, I'm a youth in the community and I think a new park is a great idea.
And I fully support it, as would the rest of the youth in the community.
Hey!
I recognize her.
That kid came to my door yesterday.
Oh, my God!
Okay, they have planted people in this audience.
Unbelievable!
You know what?
We all agree that this park is a bad idea.
We should just take a vote.
Right?
Yeah.
LESLIE Okay, we will take a vote.
Before we do that, I want everyone up, lined up behind that microphone, and I want to hear from all of you.
One by one.
ANN That was brutal.
A couple of weeks ago, I was yelling at Leslie at a public forum.
God, I hope I wasn't as obnoxious as those people.
I wasn't, right?
At 5 00 in the morning, every morning, beep, beep, beep!
I don't want to hear that.
Now, how long is this project gonna take?
That's what I want to know.
That's what's important to me.
Because I need my sleep.
I put some Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
That concludes our meeting.
What about the vote?
We're out of time.
It's 9 00.
But we will have many public forums in the future, and we hope to see you all there.
Thank you so much for coming.
LESLIE It was tough.
But, you know, that's Pawnee.
That's democracy.
There are a lot of people here that want this park.
You just gotta get past the negative people.
But guess what?
My subcommittee held its first town hall meeting tonight.
God, I loved it!
I loved every minute of it.
Hey, park lady.
Yeah?
You suck.
Hear that?
He called me "park lady.
" You know, normally, I don't agree with Leslie about anything, but this book is awesome.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Okay, now, see, here's a good example of a plant that you can't eat.
See all the spikes?
So, two things.
One, it's poisonous.
And two, it would hurt.
LESLIE The Parks Department has so many programs.
Jerry's in charge of our pre-teen nature hikes.
For a while, it was a teenage nature hike, but then we changed it because a girl got pregnant.
Look what we have here, country honeysuckle, Pawnee-style.
Yeah, take a look at that.
Wow.
It's pretty and it smells good.
Mmm.
Smells great.
Yeah, it's really nice.
Mmm.
That's bitter.
Leslie, you don't eat it.
Oh!
Why did you let me eat that?
I never told you to eat that.
Oh!
God.
Leslie, the animals know you don't eat the country honeysuckle.
I'm not an animal.
My tongue is swelling up.
No, don't touch it!
No, you can't Okay, now you'll have to throw that away.
Let's not scare the kids.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
Well, there we go then.
Let's see what else is here.
So let's tell them what other plants we can eat, Jerry.
But I have to say, there's a very sweet aftertaste though.
LESLIE So I have a piece of good news.
I've invited a reporter to come do an article about the pit behind your house.
She writes for the Pawnee Journal, which is kind of like our town's Washington Post.
That sounds really good.
Thank you, Ann.
It is a classic strategy.
The press is a weapon and you can use it to kill people or to feed people.
You know, the beginning of projects are very vulnerable, and you have to make sure that you get a lot of press, 'cause the momentum of that can kind of keep it alive, or else it'll die.
I mean, I'm sure you remember the Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project.
The Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project was a great idea that just ran out of steam.
We had removed five cartoon penises, not even 10%, when we were shut down due to lack of funding.
To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises.
One penis in particular.
Now, when the reporter gets here, it is vital that we all follow my rules about how to deal with the media.
Rule number one, stay on message.
This is key.
All we need to talk about is the pit, and the fact that we're gonna turn it into a park.
And that's it.
Okay?
Number two What?
Stay on message again?
Yes, it's that important.
It's one and two.
Stay on message and stay on message.
Right?
Stay on what, Ann?
Message.
Great.
ANN Leslie formed a committee to fill the pit in a week, which is really impressive.
I mean, until now, my only experience with government was trying to get a recycling bin.
Wait.
Did I ever get it?
Bye, Leslie.
Bye, Ann.
Hey, Mark?
Yeah.
Buy you a cup of coffee?
This is JJ's Diner, the unofficial meeting place of Pawnee's political elite.
The people who eat here basically run this town.
So, listen, I was hoping maybe I could pick your brain about how to deal with the media.
It's my first interview.
What about that thing you did for the middle school newspaper last year?
Oh.
No.
I don't count that.
That was a smear job.
So I put together some discussion topics.
Can I run them by you?
Okay.
What do you think her opening gambit is gonna be?
What is she gonna ask me first?
How you spell your name.
Of course.
Because of the silent "K".
You're so smart.
Yeah.
Okay, now should I give her a tour of the building How many discussion questions do you have there?
Um Thirty.
Wow!
You're insane.
Mark and I made love once.
And it was very intense.
Hi, I'm looking for Leslie Knope.
Okay.
Oh!
My ears are ringing.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Leslie Knope.
Hi.
I'm the deputy director of Parks and Recreation.
Shauna.
Malwae-Tweep.
Yes, I am familiar with your work.
I've read everything you've ever written.
You did an amazing in-depth article on the raccoon problem here in Pawnee.
Who left the door open?
No!
No!
No!
And I agree with you.
They are nature's bandits.
Thanks.
I was happy with that line.
So, can I give you a quick tour before we get started?
I've been here before.
A few times.
Quick tour?
Okay.
So there are 10 murals here in this hallway.
And this is called "The trial of Chief Wamapo.
" It was painted in 1936 and this is Chief Wamapo and he was convicted of crimes against the soldiers.
I am always amazed at his quiet dignity right before he's killed by a cannonball.
I'm surprised no one's complained about this.
Oh, tons of people have.
Yeah, we get letters every day.
This is Ron Swanson, our boss.
Ron, this is the reporter I was telling you about.
No comment.
About what?
Hey, Haverford, maybe one day you'll figure out how to spell a three-letter word.
Come on, Ron.
I play a lot of online Scrabble with my boss, Ron Swanson, and, oh, my God, that guy is the best.
He beats me every time.
He kills me.
He's awesome.
I can't beat him.
I should just close my account.
Well, Shauna, this is our crack team.
Hi, everyone.
Tom Haverford, boy genius.
Smooth like milk chocolate.
That's a weird way to describe me.
April Ludgate, 19.
Cool enough to be invited anywhere and chooses to be here.
And finally, we've got Ann Perkins and Andy Dwyer.
They're the real heroes of this story.
Ann was the citizen who brought the pit to our attention.
And Andy is the citizen who fell in it.
Great.
It's cool if I record this, right?
Yeah.
Good.
That way it's verbatim.
So, Leslie, you're in charge of the committee.
I'm sorry.
It's actually called a subcommittee, not a committee, so.
We can do all this on tape.
Right.
Sorry.
Sure we can.
And this is where you meet, generally?
Really?
We meet at a bunch of different places.
We don't always meet here.
So I didn't quite know how to answer that.
Okay, why don't I ask the rest of your team some questions and then we will come back to you later?
Okay, great.
That's a good idea.
Because these are the real heroes.
I'm gonna be in my office.
So, Andy, tell me about the night you fell into the pit.
Oh.
Yeah.
That's actually a great story.
I just finished up a gig with my band Three Skin, formerly Four Skin, but our bassist left for personal reasons.
And I was taking a shortcut home, and I thought I saw a toaster lying in the pit.
And I was like, "Maybe I should get that.
" And I fell in and broke my legs.
Such a tragedy.
Why would you want a toaster that's lying at the bottom of the pit?
I don't know.
I was pretty wasted.
Wait.
You were drunk?
Oh, yeah.
Totally.
You knew that.
I didn't know that, no.
You should've told me, because we gave you anesthesia at the hospital.
I was probably not thinking 'cause I had two broken femurs and I was blackout drunk.
Andy, I just I can't believe I'm just finding this out right now.
Like you're perfect.
You're on the pill.
You drink all the time.
You're allowed to do that.
Stay on message.
Thank you so much for bringing that up in front of a reporter.
Leslie, it's not that bad, right?
I mean, why don't we just go back in there and talk about the park?
Oh, Ann.
You're so sweet and innocent and pretty.
The press are like sharks, and you guys just dumped a bucket of chum in the water.
Hey, I just got your 15 texts.
Mark.
Listen, thank you for coming.
I tried to stay on message.
Mmm-hmm.
But then, Ann and Andy sandbagged me.
Andy was drunk when he fell in the pit.
And it turns out that Ann is on birth-control pills.
Okay.
Shauna is in the conference room, and she's writing a really bad article and it's gonna destroy us all.
Please fix it.
April, let me ask you something.
Do you think I'm in the top five best-looking Indian guys in Pawnee?
No.
Who do you think's got me beat?
That guy Hashish at City Planning?
Tommy boy.
Let me tell you something, Tom.
You suck at Scrabble.
I know.
You're destroying me.
You're worse than my ex-wife, and she's terrible at Scrabble.
And she's a bitch.
Look out, man.
I'm gonna get you one of these days.
I'm practicing.
Yeah, I doubt that.
Her name is Tammy Swanson and she's a serious bitch.
Hey, Leslie.
I have to go.
Let's do the interview tomorrow morning at the pit.
Yeah.
Perfect.
Great.
I'll have a photographer meet us there.
Okay.
Great.
See you then.
Disaster averted.
That was easy, right?
Yeah?
Can we go in your car?
Absolutely.
All right.
'Cause I hate driving.
There's a beautiful view from over there.
This is a great place to take a shot.
Over there as well, so I think you're fine.
Hi!
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, no problem.
Do you live near Mark?
No, not at all.
So he gave you a ride somehow?
Yeah.
You know, do you have a pen?
'Cause I don't No, sorry.
Michael, do you have any paper I could borrow?
I might, yeah.
I don't mean to complain, but I think Shauna is being a little unprofessional.
She got here She's wearing the same dress she wore yesterday.
And she had to get a ride from So how big is this lot?
Leslie, how big is What?
How big is the lot?
The lot?
How big is what?
I don't know.
You tell me.
How big is the lot?
A hundred or something.
Give or take 100.
I don't know.
A hundred what?
I don't know, Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
I don't know.
I don't I guess I don't know anything.
Are you okay?
I have to get something from my car.
What are you doing?
Kicking Ron's butt at Scrabble.
I just played "lexicons" for a billion points.
No, no, no, no, no.
What?
I was letting him win, dumbass.
Whatever.
Oh.
Come on.
"Lateral, communal, zonal"?
You dropped a "Z" in there?
April.
So when did you start at the Parks Department?
Well, it was a few years ago.
My mother got me the job.
I was qualified.
It's not like it was nepotism.
Crap on a stick.
Okay, technically, yes, it was nepotism.
But Oh, my God.
No, it wasn't.
Sorry.
It's not you.
I just I'm exhausted.
I got, like, zero sleep last night.
So Oh.
Hey, Leslie.
Hey!
You're home.
Yeah, I'm home.
I was doing an interview at the pit, and it was going really well.
In fact, it was going perfect.
But I decided to leave in the middle of it 'cause I figured I nailed it so why push it, right?
Yeah.
Can I come in?
Sure, yeah.
Great.
Come on in.
So how'd it go?
She didn't ask about Andy being drunk, did she?
Oh.
No.
No, just your kind of standard questions.
There was one annoying thing.
She and Mark had sex with each other.
You're kidding.
I wish I was, but I'm not.
They did it.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep and Mark Brendanawicz had sex with each other last night.
Who had sex?
That guy Mark and the reporter.
Called it.
I called that.
You remember that?
Yeah.
He did, actually.
He totally called that.
Why do men have to behave like this?
Why can't they be professionals?
Men are dogs.
You know, maybe they really like each other.
He doesn't like her.
He was probably thinking with the head of his wiener instead of the head of his brain.
Oh.
God.
Andy, come on.
Men do that.
It's disgusting.
Well, I should go talk to him.
Make sure that he didn't say anything to hurt the project.
Yeah.
Definitely, you should talk to him.
Yeah.
Good idea, Ann.
I bet he didn't use a condom.
Andy, God!
LESLIE Hello, Mark.
May I come into your office?
I need to speak with you about something very sensitive.
Something's come to my attention that requires your attention.
It has come to my attention that you had sex with Ms. Malwae-Tweep.
That's personal.
It's unethical and it's irresponsible for a public servant to have sex with a member of the press corps.
Especially when you have sex with someone who is so skanky.
I mean, have sex with her and I'm gonna say something.
I don't want you to take it the wrong way.
But you're being a huge dork.
Well, I can't allow that kind of behavior from someone serving on my subcommittee.
Well, then I resign from your subcommittee.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Hi, this is deputy director of Parks and Recreation Leslie?
Hi.
Yes, hi.
I accidentally ate an old burrito.
What?
I was acting strange at the pit and the reason is because I had food poisoning from an old burrito.
So, I was hoping we could have a do-over interview.
Maybe over lunch.
I'm buying.
Yeah, I guess I'm free.
I'm assuming not Mexican.
Why?
Because of the burrito.
Oh!
Yeah, well, it wasn't a Mexican burrito.
Are you sure that's the best thing for you right now?
Oh, it's the best thing on the menu.
So, look, I feel like I may have gone a little off message at the pit.
Yeah, you seemed a little weird.
Well, I wouldn't say weird.
It's just, we're trying to turn a dangerous eyesore into a beautiful community park and a positive article could go a long way towards making that happen.
Great.
So what do you think the odds are that this park is actually gonna get made?
Can I say over 100%?
Because I would be lying if I said less.
Wow.
You seem a lot more confident than some of the other people I've spoken to.
Can I read you some of these quotes?
Be my guest.
"The Sullivan Street pit is always going to be a pit.
" Well, until it turns into a park.
Yes, I agree.
"Hey, you should write an article on unicorns, "because they're more likely to exist than this park.
" Oh, really?
Tell that to a 14-year-old girl.
"You should write an article on the Pope getting married, "because that's more likely to happen than this park.
" There are some countries where the Pope can be married.
"You should write an article on talking monkeys.
" Really?
Have you seen The Wizard of Oz?
"You should write an article about leprechauns.
" Leprechauns exist.
"You should write an article about the sun falling out of the sky.
" Why would you write an article about that?
That's This one is just "No.
" "This park is never, ever, ever, ever going to happen.
" Might I ask who said that?
Mark Brendanawicz.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hi.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, what's up?
You and I need to find a way to fix this reporter thing.
Why is this a big deal to anybody?
Well, apparently, the reporter is gonna print everything you said to her.
But I didn't say anything to her.
"The park is never, ever, ever, ever getting built"?
But that stuff was off the record.
Did you say it was off the record?
Do you have to say it's off the record?
Oh, God.
Hey.
Thank you so much for meeting us.
Sure.
Hey, Mark.
Hey.
Uh I heard that you were gonna print some of that stuff that I said in private about the park.
Oh, yeah.
My editor loves it.
You know, we'd really appreciate it if you didn't print that stuff 'cause we're trying to build this park I don't understand.
You did say it, right?
Technically.
Technically?
Well, you know, you got up because you had to write the article and I said, "Come on, stay in bed.
"That park is never, ever, ever gonna get made.
" Right.
And then I came back to bed.
Yeah, but the important part of what I said was, "Stay in bed.
" You know, I would've said anything at that point if I thought it would make you stay in bed.
Okay, well, since we're, you know, romantically involved, I won't print any of it.
That's great.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
You know, I wouldn't say romantically involved.
You know, going forward.
Oh, my God.
What?
Ron Swanson.
Tom.
Ron, I don't know what to tell you, man.
April got on my computer.
Password was saved.
She played a couple of Scrabble words.
It wasn't me.
I don't even know what lexicons are.
I thought that was a luxury automobile.
You're the word king.
She was probably cheating.
I knew that couldn't have been you.
You don't have the vocabulary.
I know.
You can't even spell vocabulary.
Yeah.
V-O-G-X Was that right?
No.
We're cool.
I'm not an idiot.
I know Tom has been losing to me on purpose.
But I like Tom.
He doesn't do a lot of work around here.
He shows zero initiative.
He's not a team player.
He's never one to go that extra mile.
Tom is exactly what I'm looking for in a government employee.
Hey, you busy?
Well, I'm writing an op-ed piece about media ethics for the Pawnee Journal, so, yeah, I'm a little busy.
I wanted to apologize to you.
Really?
Yeah.
I never should've done anything with that reporter.
Whoa!
You nailed Malwae-Tweep?
Nice.
Yes, but I'm not gonna do it again.
It's over.
So she's available.
I really did think that that stuff that I said was off the record.
But you were right, and I should've listened to you.
I tried to get her to pull some of those quotes and things got a little dicey.
Well, I appreciate you trying.
Would you like to be reinstated onto our subcommittee?
Absolutely.
You'll have my answer within the month.
Mark, can I ask you a question?
You didn't really believe it when you said that the park was never gonna get made, right?
Park's gonna get done.
Welcome back, subcommittee member Mark Brendanawicz.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks, a lot.
Thank you a lot.
Man, that dude has stuck it in some crazy chicks.
LESLIE Well, the article came out, and it was a mixed bag.
"An abandoned lot on Sullivan Street "has been proposed as the site of a new park.
" That part's good.
I think we stayed on message for that part.
And then it gets a little unpleasant.
"Pretty drunk, Ann's on the pill.
" I didn't "throw up," I spit up.
JJ's Diner gets a nice mention.
Oh, and right here.
At the end.
She writes, and I quote, "We'll see.
" Ends on a hopeful note.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
TOM So, we've been called out to this hiking trail because there's some reports that some teenagers are digging bags of dog poop out of the trash and having dog poop fights.
I don't believe it.
Oh, my God.
It's real.
Uh Yeah, I'm not gonna go deal with this.
I'm leaving.
Hey!
Hey!
Hello?
Boys!
I am Leslie Knope.
I work for the Department of Parks and Recreation.
Nice!
Okay, all right.
Cool it!
Okay.
Get her shoes!
No!
That's disgusting!
What are you doing?
Help!
Help!
Help!
Tom!
Tom!
No!
Smells so bad!
Why would you think this was fun?
Really?
Oh, really?
Really?
Oh, hey!
Hey!
You like it?
Boom!
Okay, here we go.
Who wants it?
Whoo, missed it!
Yeah!
Actually, this is a little fun.
This is fun.
Get her hair!
Oh.
Ooh.
Hey, Tom.
Check it out.
Norton Construction just sent this over.
Whoa, mama!
I love Great Lakes wine.
You can have the wine.
I want to take that cheese and do terrible things to it.
No, no, no, no, no!
You know as well as I do that we are not allowed to accept gifts over $25, for corruption reasons.
We live in a fish bowl and the public is always watching.
That's why I go two towns over if I want to rent a movie with nudity in it.
Mmm.
Yeah, I probably shouldn't have said that.
But you cannot enjoy this basket, I'm so sorry.
And so to avoid temptation, I am gonna lock it up.
When you're in government, there's a million ways to exploit your power.
Have I ever given in to that temptation?
No, never.
I'm not that kind of politician.
Official Parks and Rec business.
Just need to grab a quick hot dog.
Sorry about that, little girl, you can have the next one.
TOM I have a moral code, and I never violate it.
People look at me and they say, "Wow, Tom.
"You are so pure, you're like a brown Superman with a beard "that just stands for justice and truth and the American way.
" So, Ann.
I asked April to create one of those social network Internet profiles for the Sullivan Street pit.
So, are you guys ready for the debut?
Yes, can we cut that red ribbon around your monitor now?
Absolutely.
I love a good ribbon cutting.
Oh.
April, that's good.
Yeah.
Kids.
Hey, look, the pit already has six friends.
Oh, yeah.
Mark.
Mark's a friend.
Well, you guys gotta see Mark's profile.
Look at the photos of these ladies on his page.
Wow.
Ew!
Sick.
Maybe those are his relatives.
Yeah, maybe fake boobs run in his family.
Look at this lady.
She's got a thong on her face.
Oh, my God, his favorite movie is Dances With Wolves.
Okay, we're good.
We'll keep checking in on this.
Where is Mark, anyway?
Attending yet another meeting of the old boys' club.
LESLIE Politics is full of boys' clubs, formal and informal.
Behind me are all the members of the city council over the past 30 years.
And every day, as a woman, I have to walk past this wall of men.
It can be very upsetting.
Especially because of that guy.
No matter what direction I move, he's always staring at my chest.
Hmm.
See?
What are they doing out there?
Wheeling and dealing.
Divvying up the empire.
Oh, my wife got me this shirt.
She swears it makes me look thinner.
It kind of does.
You know what we should do?
Let's go out there.
Let's bust up that old boys' club.
We're doing great work in the government.
We deserve to be included.
Sure, yeah.
I could use a beer.
Yes, Ann!
That's good, think like a man.
April, we're leaving, you're in charge.
And it's because you're a woman!
What, do you really like red tape and uphill battles?
Hey, Leslie!
Hey!
What is up?
I'll tell you what's up.
A couple of ladies are coming to bust up your little boys' club.
Awesome.
Glad to have you.
Let me get you a beer.
We're in.
Hey, I'm Brian.
Hi, Brian, Leslie Knope.
Deputy director of Drink that.
Okay.
I'm Ann, everyone.
I don't work here.
Hey, Ann.
Steve.
So, what are you guys talking about?
What's the topic du jour?
Oh!
Did you hear that?
That was the sound of a glass ceiling being shattered.
LESLIE The boys' club is more about socializing than work, you know?
I mean, you gotta loosen up.
I kind of feel like I'm already in the boys' club.
I mean, look at those bitches clean up after me.
So, is this, like, your regular Tuesday night scene?
Well, it's just a way to unwind, you know.
Mmm-hmm.
Really different from your Friday night crowd, right?
What crowd?
You know, the girls with the tribal back tattoos who drink Red Bull for a living.
Oh!
Oh, I like this.
This is banter.
That crowd.
Banter's fun.
Where'd that come from?
We were just on the computer, looking at your profile.
You know, you have a friend who has a tattoo that says, "Daddy's Girl.
" And both words are misspelled.
Ooh!
Mixing it up with the boys!
So What are you gonna say?
What's your comeback?
Those aren't really my friends anymore.
I don't hang out with them.
Oh, boo.
Brendanawicz, that's some weak sauce.
You need to hit harder!
Natalie, it's your sister.
Pick me up or I'm gonna draw all over your jeans.
Well, it's official, people.
We're out of beer.
That's the cue.
See you later, Leslie.
It was nice hanging out, you know, after work hours.
Wait!
I think I'm gonna take off, too.
Yeah, I should go, Leslie.
Wait, you guys!
Let's keep this good feeling going.
It's just getting started!
Uh, yeah, 'cause parties usually get started when you run out of booze.
Okay, wait.
Just hold on a second.
I got wine!
Hey!
And cheese!
Hey!
Good morning.
Last night, in a foolish attempt to infiltrate a boys' club, I violated the government employee ethics code of the state of Indiana.
I have always tried to live my life in an ethical way, and last night, I failed.
I realize I have let down every female public official in America, and I would like to apologize to them, right now, individually, and in alphabetical order.
Michele Bachmann, Republican, Minnesota.
I am sorry.
Tammy Baldwin, Democrat, Wisconsin.
I'm so sorry, Tammy.
Melissa Bean.
Okay.
Double shift, remember?
So I won't see you till tomorrow.
Are you gonna be okay?
Oh, yeah.
I got dinner.
Oh, God.
Honey, can you just clean up a little bit?
I'll try.
Don't expect much.
Okay.
I'll do it when I get home.
You will?
Yes.
Yes.
AND Y Ann is amazing.
She takes care of me, she takes care of sick people, sick babies.
She is an angel.
And I seriously love her.
Hard.
She's going to be gone for the next 24 hours so I made this list and basically this place is gonna be like a sparkling palace when she returns.
I took a bunch of painkillers.
They're about to kick in so I'm ready to go.
There it is.
Let's clear the air.
Last night, I opened up this gift basket, for my own pleasure.
Really.
Leslie Knope.
Usually such a prudish stickler for the rules.
I'm not happy about it either, Tom.
It's like I don't even know you anymore.
Last year you wrote me up for making personal phone calls to my mom.
Yes, I did.
And I would do it again.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
Yes, but she was in the hospital.
I did not know that at the time.
So, can I have the basket?
No, I'm sorry.
It's evidence.
It's a nice basket.
What would you put in there?
I don't know.
Potpourri?
That's a lot of potpourri.
Hey, I am not the one on trial here.
I appreciate and thank you in advance for your unwavering support.
I think you should go to jail.
Think about what you've done.
Go to jail?
What's going on?
Ron, I have a very important and very long story to tell you.
Put it in an e-mail?
Nope.
It happened right out there, right outside this window.
Why can't I look away?
Let's not blow this out of proportion.
I will blow this in proportion!
The minimum punishment for this is an official reprimand from the city manager.
It's not that big a deal.
Maybe in your world it isn't a big deal.
You're a white Protestant man with a full, rich mustache.
But I am a woman and I need to hold myself up to a higher standard.
This is ridiculous.
You're punishing yourself more than anybody else is gonna punish you.
No.
What do you suggest we do?
You think we should cover this up?
No, I'm not saying that.
No one said cover-up.
Good, because the cover-up is worse than the crime.
When you spill something and you try to wipe it up with something that's dirty, then you get double dirty.
Please don't make this worse.
Oh, my God.
Good afternoon.
Since we last spoke, I have taken extraordinary steps to make further amends for the mistakes that I have made.
LESLIE I have written a full confession, which I will be e-mailing to everyone in the entire Pawnee government.
I've also attached a link to the pit's web page, just to remind people of all the good work that I do.
I asked Ron to blow the whistle on me, and he refused.
And that is why I had to whistle-blow myself.
AND Y I wish I could say some of this mess was Ann's, but it's all mine.
I'm kind of a nester.
Huh?
Not bad for a guy with two broken legs.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm doing a little experiment tonight to see what will get me drunker.
Drinking wine Leslie.
Come here.
See what April put on the pit's web page.
Right now, drinking wine is winning Oh, my God.
What am I looking at?
A video of me drinking some of that wine you stole.
What?
Why did you do this?
Because I was waiting for my sister and I was bored, and my hair looked really good.
And you put it in the pit's web page?
Yeah.
Okay, take this off.
Okay.
I just sent an e-mail to everyone in the government, and I put a link to this page!
A young law-breaker.
A future Leslie Knope.
Play it again for us, Jerry.
You got it.
Leslie?
She's 19 years old.
I thought I told you not to make this worse.
And I heard you loud and clear.
But then you made it worse.
The disciplinary committee is having a hearing tomorrow, and you're gonna have to testify.
Oh, no.
April might get dismissed.
You could get fired.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
This bench is so uncomfortable.
Ow.
Help.
Please, Ron.
Ron.
Ron, tell me it's gonna be okay.
Tell me it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna Ron?
Where are you?
It's It'II Hang in.
Ron!
Okay.
You're okay.
Good evening.
I've spoken to you a couple of times about something that happened, but I don't want to I don't want to talk about it anymore.
So, the disciplinary committee awaits.
Feeling good?
Feeling strong?
Not really.
No.
Do you want me to run some test questions with you?
Maybe give you an idea of what the disciplinary committee will be like?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Yeah, thanks, Tom.
Okay.
So, Miss Knope, you're accused of stealing wine.
How many drinks do you have per week, on average?
Zero.
Zero to six.
I'm gonna write down 10.
Yeah.
Do you ever cheat on your taxes?
No, no, no.
Never.
Good.
You're doing great.
How many sexual partners have you had in the last year?
Are they gonna ask that?
This is a deposition-style hearing, Miss Knope.
Nothing is off-limits.
You have to answer.
Now, how many sexual partners have you had in the last year?
Zero to six.
Zero.
Have you ever thought about Ron sexually?
What?
Including dreams.
Have you ever had a sexual dream about our boss, Ron Swanson?
No!
Absolutely not.
No.
Yes.
No.
Now, in this recurring dream that you have about Ron, is he like a regular Ron, or is he half-Ron, half-animal, like a centaur?
What?
No Is he wearing a football uniform?
Are you making love to him on a couch shaped like his mustache?
Is he covered in Powerade?
No, okay.
Time-out.
Time-out.
This committee doesn't take time-outs, Miss Knope.
Now answer the question!
I need something to drink.
How about some stolen wine?
No.
I meant water.
Thank you for your time, Miss Knope.
You're fired.
So, that's kind of your worst-case scenario, you know?
If you can handle that, I think you'll be fine.
Great.
LESLIE Ron, thank you for being here with me today.
I'm your department head.
I have to be.
Nonetheless.
MAN Miss Knope?
LESLIE Yes.
MAN You're here because you allegedly accepted a gift of over $25 and contributed to the delinquency of a minor.
Can you tell us what happened?
I'm gonna take a glass of water first, if I may.
Certainly.
Sorry.
"Two days ago, "I attended an informal boys' club meeting for the very first time.
"After one and a half beers, "awash in the glow of acceptance "into this elite, exclusive club " Sorry, what club is this?
A couple city planners like to drink beer in the courtyard on Tuesday nights.
No one is supposed to drink alcohol on government property.
That's not my department.
Go ahead, Leslie.
"I made a very unwise decision.
"A decision that will live in infamy.
"I opened a gift basket of wine and cheese.
"Our intern, April Ludgate, "drank some of that wine without my knowledge.
"That was never part of the plan.
"She had not been invited to the meeting of the boys' club.
"I repeat, not been invited.
"Though it is my hope that someday, she lives in a world "where the very idea of boys' clubs is ancient history.
" But you did open the gift basket.
And the intern did drink the wine.
Please don't blame her for my mistake.
The biggest crime we could commit here would be to destroy a teenage girl's passion for local government.
There's only one more thing I need to clean, me.
Um, I can't really get into a shower, so I got this idea from my parents.
This is how they clean their dog.
Do you like that?
Huh?
I wrote that for Ann.
It's gonna be playing when she walks through the door today.
And check this out.
Washed my shorts.
How do you like that?
Hey.
Turn that down.
No.
I wrote that song.
I don't care.
Turn it down.
What are you doing in my yard, Lawrence?
Get out of here.
Okay, you know what?
I'm taking this.
Put down my boom box.
It's my boom box now.
I asked you nicely.
You did not ask me nicely!
Put that down!
I just put 12 new batteries in that thing!
Lawrence, come on!
What's going on out here?
Give it to me!
Come on.
Go back inside, Hank.
Miss Knope, what was the first thing you did when you arrived at work the next day?
Can you go over the time line for us once more?
Yes, of course.
I awoke at 6:21 a. m. After a fitful night of sleep We've been over this.
What more could you guys possibly want her to do?
Well, we don't know yet.
Frankly we've got a lot more questions.
Ron, it's okay.
No, it's not.
This is not communist China.
You cannot make her whip herself.
You cannot make her wear a hair shirt.
We weren't planning on doing either of those things.
This is America.
You want to live in North Korea, you can live in North Korea.
I don't want to.
I want to live in America.
Leslie has never broken a rule in her life, to the point that it's annoying.
If you want to slap her on the wrist, go ahead.
If you want to do anything more serious, you're gonna have to go through me.
Let's go.
Are we done?
We're done, let's go.
So, after all that, it's really not that bad.
You're gonna get a letter in your file.
Ron, I just wanted to say thank you, so Don't worry about it.
No, I didn't do it for Leslie.
I did it because I hate bureaucracy.
My idea of a perfect government is one guy, who sits in a small room at a desk, and the only thing he's allowed to decide is who to nuke.
The man is chosen based on some kind of IQ test, and maybe also a physical tournament, like a decathlon.
And women are brought to him, maybe, when he desires them.
LESLIE Oh, hey, Ann.
You're here.
ANN Yeah, I came from the hospital.
How'd it go?
I don't want to be overdramatic, but today felt like and the absolute worst day of my life.
Oh, God.
I never should have opened that stupid basket.
Yeah.
Why did you open that basket?
It doesn't really seem like you.
I think it's 'cause I wanted to shatter the glass ceiling.
You know what I mean?
And just kind of infiltrate the boys' club.
Hmm.
I did it for a guy.
Oh!
Yeah.
Mark.
Oh.
Oh.
Wow.
I We had a brief affair in February of 2004.
And there's still something very complicated between us, so Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah.
Smart woman.
Iffy choice in men.
But then again, I'm not one to talk.
What do you think?
Andy.
This is so sweet.
It's nothing.
What happened to you?
Oh, I was chasing our neighbor who's a total jagweed and I fell in some prickly bushes.
Doesn't matter.
What do you think of the house, huh?
Were you totally surprised?
Yeah.
Do you love it?
Yeah.
Here, baby.
Sit down.
I'm gonna put something on those scratches.
Somebody is getting gently laid tonight.
Andy!
God!
You look like you need one of these.
Come on.
You're over 21.
You're not supposed to be drinking on government property.
Loosen up.
You're gonna drive yourself crazy trying to follow every single rule in government.
Mark, I have a letter in my file.
I got seven letters in my file.
Pretty much every guy in city planning has a bunch of letters.
So, welcome to the team.
Look out, boys.
I'm in your club now.
I'm in your club.
I'm in your club.
I'm in your club.
I'm in your club.
I'm in your Mmm.
Creepy.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
In a town as old as Pawnee, there's a lot of history in every acre.
This wooded area is the site of, um, the murder, actually, of Nathaniel Bixby Mark.
He was a pioneer who was killed by a tribe of Wamapoke Indians, after he traded them a baby for what is now Indianapolis.
They cut his face off.
And they made it into a dream catcher.
And they made his legs into rain sticks.
And that's the great thing about Indians, back then, is, they used every part of the pioneer.
Today is a great day for the Knope family.
My mother is being honored at a banquet with the Tellenson Award for Excellence in Pawnee Public Service.
The award's named after the legendary Tony Tellenson, who was a great man.
Sorry, is a great man.
I, for one, am glad that they're keeping him alive.
I saw you survive that town hall meeting.
You keep that up and you're gonna be figuring out what wall to put your own Tellenson Award on.
Oh, I already know, the one on the left where the American flag is.
But I think we could be a multi-generational political dynasty, you and I, you know?
Like the Kennedys, or the Bushes.
Minus the drinking problem.
I mean no disrespect.
The only reason anybody's going to this thing is because they're afraid of what Marlene'll do to them if they don't.
That woman is tough.
In 1994, I gave her a nickname.
It's unrepeatable, but it stuck.
It's my proudest accomplishment.
It's "The Iron of Pawnee.
" This is very exciting.
This is a big night.
We are gonna meet some powerful people tonight, so take this down.
Mmm-hmm.
Good evening.
Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mother.
How important are speeches?
I don't know, ask the Gettysburg Address.
Oh, it didn't answer your call?
Maybe because it was in the Smithsonian.
It was a great learning experience because my mom casts a long shadow.
Read that part back to me.
"I was learning-disabled and my mom cast a very long shadow.
" No, I didn't say "learning-disabled.
" Um, we'll just move on.
We can fix that later.
Long shadow, go.
Okay, I've lost my momentum now.
Um, all right, let's start from the top.
What's the first sentence again?
"Marlene Griggs-Knope is morbidly obese.
" I never said "obese.
" I said "is my mother.
" Oh, sorry.
I got it.
I need to mention the park and in a very subtle way, I need to let people know that I'm forging my own path and I have my own subcommittee.
But I don't want to sound braggy.
What do I do?
It's about appearing humble, you know?
Abraham Lincoln, when he started his speeches, he would come up and say, "My name's Abraham Lincoln.
"I'm the President of the United States.
"But I'm gonna be honest with you.
I have no clue what I'm doing.
" So, maybe you start off with something like that.
Okay.
So, I start off with, "I am Leslie Knope.
"I am the Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, "and to be honest with you, I don't know what I'm doing.
" Yeah.
Yeah.
Then, I think what we want to do at that point is start getting the energy up.
Yeah.
How about this?
"Marlene Griggs-Knope is definitely not a whore.
" No.
"Marlene Griggs-Knope "has not five but seven Asian friends.
"Marlene Griggs-Knope has never solicited a male prostitute.
"Marlene Griggs-Knope has said the N-word only four times in her entire life.
" No!
No!
She said it more than that?
How about this one?
That is hot.
Seriously?
Yes.
That is really hot.
How come you don't dress up like that for me?
Well, 'cause I would feel a little silly putting on a nice dress to go to "the couch.
" ANN I haven't been out in so long.
Andy being in a cast has definitely put a crimp in our social life.
I don't really know Leslie's mom, and I don't know what the Tellenson Award is, but at this moment in my life, it sounds like a magical evening.
Babe, I'm out of milk.
ANN How dressy is this, exactly?
To the max.
It is the most exclusive local government event of the year.
Really?
Yeah.
The Tellensons is like the Oscars times the Grammys plus the Super Bowl.
Wow.
Okay.
Um, I should probably change.
I'm headed to the salon right now.
LESLIE Salvatore Manfrelotti has been cutting hair across from Pioneer Hall since 1958.
All the movers and shakers who come through Pawnee have sat in that chair at one point or another.
I mean, he's the guy that made Larry Bird look the way he does.
Next.
So, what's the inside scoop, Salvatore?
My feet hurt.
Classic Salvatore!
Do I know you?
Uh, no.
This is my first official political haircut.
I'm Leslie Knope, Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation.
Are you related to that Marlene Something-Knope?
That depends.
Would you call being her daughter related?
What the hell else would you call it?
Now, what do you want me to do with this?
Well, my mom is being honored tonight.
So, in a way, I am also being honored.
And I just wanted to mix things up a little bit, you know?
Pin it up, something sassy, but powerful and dynastic.
Hi, April.
Good evening, sir.
I'm off the clock, April.
You don't need to call me sir.
Salvatore calls this hairdo "The Mayor.
" And yes, I will wear my hair like this when I am the first female mayor of Pawnee.
Oh, man, I am way overdressed.
What are you talking about?
You look great.
We look great.
Everyone's looking at us.
Yeah, I know.
You want a drink?
Yes, I do very much want a drink.
That man is staring.
That's former City Councilman Frank Schnable.
Oh, we are in rarified air tonight, Ann.
Rarified air!
He's coming over.
What?
Okay.
Be cool, be cool!
I will try.
Hello.
Hello, former City Councilman.
I am Leslie Knope.
I am the daughter of the honoree this evening.
I just wanted to tell you that I think that what you two are doing is so brave.
Just being who you are.
I wish I had your courage.
Okay, let's go.
RON I enjoy government functions like I enjoy getting kicked in the nuggets with a steel-toe boot.
But this hotel always serves bacon-wrapped shrimp.
That's my number one favorite food wrapped around my number three favorite food.
I'd go to a banquet and honor of those Somali pirates, if they served bacon-wrapped shrimp.
Excuse me.
Hey, Table 12.
Can I get a "what what"?
Wow.
Thank you.
I mean, Ann, you look stunning, but, Leslie, wow.
I was going for wow.
You got it.
I was told it was black tie.
I like your hairdo, Leslie.
Thank you, Ron.
It's just like my brother's.
He's an officer in the Air Force.
Bacon-wrapped shrimp.
Oh.
Thanks, I'm okay.
I wasn't offering.
Oh, Ann, don't look.
No, no, I said don't look.
Seated behind us is Janine Restrepo.
We need to rezone the pit to turn it into a park and she's on the zoning board.
Oh, what a night!
Please.
This is so cool.
At that table are all eight living Tellenson Award winners.
Bert Winfield, Geoffrey Morglesberg, Quentin Arble, Dawn Krink, Michael Holloway, I don't know who that is, that's somebody's wife, Horace Rangel, Wilmer Vism and Oscar Pfortmiller.
Wait.
Oscar Pfortmiller is dead.
That's his disappointing son, Theo.
Another dynasty.
What a testament to my mother.
If a bomb went off in here, it would definitely make the Indianapolis papers.
Guys, we have to get me to talk to Janine Restrepo.
She's right behind us and she could rezone our park.
Well, then just go up there and say hello and start talking to her.
Brilliant political strategy, Mark.
Maybe I should mention her massive weight loss.
You're over-thinking this.
Here, I'm gonna pretend to be Janine Restrepo.
You, be you.
Go.
Hello, Madame Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo.
I am Leslie Knope from the Parks What are you doing?
Oh, I'm Pawnee Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo.
And I can do whatever I want.
Please, tell me about this park that you badly need rezoned by me.
Okay, well, I think it would be a good idea to have a multi-use community park.
Oh.
Do you?
Oh!
Wait, what's that?
What?
I'm just former City Councilman Frank Whatever-The-Hell.
And I have more power than Janine Restrepo, so I can do whatever I want.
I don't even know if that's true or not.
Oh, my God, really?
Well, I'm Marlene Griggs-Knope and I will destroy you all!
What the hell are you guys doing?
It's fun to pretend to be zoning board members.
Hey!
Hi!
Hey My goodness.
Look at you.
You like?
I went to Salvatore.
Salvatore usually does men.
Usually.
But this time he made an exception.
Hmm.
This is Ann Perkins.
Oh, right, Leslie's new friend.
Yeah, friend.
She's We're friends.
Just friends.
I have a boyfriend.
He's a man.
So, I need your advice.
I'm seated near Janine Restrepo.
The queen of the zoning board?
Am I the only Person here who doesn't know Janine Restrepo?
I think she could be very useful.
What's my in?
Oh, let's see.
You wrote a speech?
Yes.
It's 22 minutes long, with the song.
I could cut the song.
The song's cut.
Scrap the whole thing.
Let's make the speech work for us.
Oh, politics!
Yes!
My mom is crazy good at this.
Okay, the two things you have going for you is your connection with me, of course, and the fact that Restrepo loves feeling important.
So make sure that you butter her up.
I will.
I'll make her feel like a human dinner roll.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Leslie Knope, Marlene's daughter.
Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mom, but she's so much more than that.
She's also my mother.
And together, we are the Knopes.
And if you weren't thinking it, you probably already said it, "political dynasty.
" Please save your applause until the end.
There are so many luminaries here tonight.
I mean, the list includes such amazing people as zoning board member Janine Restrepo, and others.
In conclusion, my mom is Marlene Griggs-Knope.
And I am just so psyched that Janine Restrepo is here.
I love you, Mom.
And you, too, Janine.
You're the man, Leslie!
Thanks, Tom.
Hi, Ann.
I wish I could talk.
Moving and shaking.
This is my evening.
I'm Leslie's trophy wife.
I'd like to invite anyone who has a few words to say to Marlene to come up during dinner.
Hello, Pawnee government!
My name is Tom Haverford.
And if five years ago, you told me I was gonna be in this ballroom with Marlene Griggs-Knope, I would've guessed we were getting married.
Janine?
Hi.
Hi.
Have we ever met?
No, but I am a big fan.
I'm Marlene's daughter.
Yeah, I got that.
Right, and I would love to speak to you about the ways we can improve our city.
Okay, well, call my secretary, and maybe we can set something up for next month.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Next month, then.
Fine.
Uh-huh.
Bye.
Andy, I can't leave now.
I'll get one for you on the way home.
Okay, meatball and ham.
Wait, is that two different subs?
Really?
I don't know if they can do that.
Come on!
I'm serious!
Now, the words "too sexy" aren't really in my vocabulary, but, Marlene, girl, you are too sexy!
I refuse to lather Marlene up, kiss her ring like everybody else.
Instead I'll be delivering a speech of facts.
Marlene is a woman.
She has worked in the government for three decades.
Thirty years.
Properly applied, that's how long a good varnish should last.
So, Marlene, it is true that you have won this award.
Brendanawicz.
Let's bounce.
We're gonna be late.
For what?
Ladies.
Scully's Bar.
Let's go.
Bounce, bounce, bounce.
No.
Please, you guys are the only people here I know.
Uh, well, this thing's kind of wrapping up.
Maybe we could leave a little later.
Uh, it's 9:30, on a Friday night in Pawnee.
There's not gonna be a later, Mark.
Come on, now, you promised we'd go hit on chicks.
Maybe you and Leslie can join us at the bar.
Look, I would love to come hit on chicks with you guys, but she seems kind of engaged in something and I think I should probably stay.
You'd hit on chicks?
For real?
All right, you know what?
We're gonna be at Scully's if you two can tear yourselves away.
Let's do this, Mark.
It went really well with Restrepo.
She said I should call her and we can set something up next month.
Did she say call her or call her secretary?
Secretary.
That's good, right?
Secretary makes her schedule.
That's great, honey.
She's blowing us off.
What?
No!
Really?
Honey, she's totally blowing us off.
What?
That is not conduct worthy of the zoning board.
She's a little weasel.
Okay, I didn't want to have to use this, but her husband got a DUl in Illinois last week.
And she's trying to keep it quiet.
Well, everyone has their problems.
So, what should my next tactic be?
The DUl, Leslie.
Let her know you know all about it, connect it to what you want, and then tell her if she doesn't help you, and soon, you're gonna tell everybody in town.
I don't think I could do that.
I mean, I want to win a Tellenson Award some day.
They don't give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that.
Sweetheart, they only give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that.
Those are eight of the nastiest, most diabolical people you could ever want to meet.
Bert Winfield was a blackmailer.
And Dawn Krink slept her way to the top of the DMV.
Trip Holloway named names in the '50s.
Horace Rangel used the police department to harass journalists.
And Jesus, honey.
Tony Tellenson was the worst.
He tried to re-segregate the drinking fountains.
Hey, Ann, where's Mark?
He left with Tom.
Shoot!
I have a tough assignment, and I need his help with it.
I could help.
Give me something to do.
Okay, well, apparently Restrepo was trying to blow us off, so my mom has a plan.
We're gonna twist her arm a little bit.
She's trying to cover up for the fact that she has a husband who likes to vroom-vroom-vroom-vroom and glug-glug-glug-glug-glug.
So you're gonna blackmail her?
No, I'm just gonna get tough with her, Tellenson-style.
That doesn't sound tough to me, that sounds slimy.
It sounds like your mom's telling you to be slimy.
Ann, you don't understand politics.
Look, nursing is easy.
Really?
Yeah.
You just go to work, and people come in, and you heal them.
But politics is different, you know?
Sometimes you have to bring the pain.
You can't let yourself get taken advantage of.
I think your mom's giving you bad advice.
I don't think so.
You just do everything your mom tells you to do?
You just do everything your boyfriend tells you to do?
Make any pancakes lately?
He has two broken legs.
Yeah, and he's got three crutches.
And one of them is you!
And the other two are crutches.
You know, I don't need to be here.
It's okay.
You're allowed to fight.
You two are just like everyone else.
Thank you, former Councilman Schnable.
And now, a very special message from Mr. Anthony Tellenson himself, recorded earlier this year from his hospital bed, before he lost the power of speech.
I'm leaving now, honey.
Cool Ranch, got it.
Anything else?
Mmm I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to get those tonight.
Well, 'cause I don't think I can find a store that's open that sells slippers.
TOM I've been dying to go out with Mark.
Always thought we'd make a great team.
You know?
He's handsome, I'm a cutie pie.
He's laid back.
I'm more in your face, but in a fun way.
Ladies don't stand a chance.
Uh What's with the hat?
It's called peacocking.
Basically, I'm wearing something that kind of makes me stand out, like a peacock.
So, the girls will be like, "Hey, what's with that hat"?
I'm gonna go peacock it out.
I'll be back.
Okay.
Thank you, Tony, for those inspiring twitches and blinks.
LESLIE I think we're gonna meet a little earlier than what you said.
How about Monday?
Call my secretary and we'll set it up.
Not good enough.
Not good enough?
Nope.
I know about things.
Well, my schedule is my schedule.
So, I'm just gonna get back to my dessert.
Drive much?
Excuse me?
Your husband.
Does he drive much out of state?
I know that your husband is a drunk driver.
My mom told me.
What do you want?
Uh Just saying.
I Get out.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
Mmm-hmm.
I don't know what came over me.
Leave.
I hope your husband gets help and that you have a long and happy marriage.
Stacy, Becky tells me that you two are both real estate agents.
That must be fun.
Uh-huh.
Any cool stories you got, huh?
Um What do you mean?
Like, I don't know, anything weird or funny happen when you guys are showing people houses?
Um One time, I forgot my keys to one of the houses.
Whoa!
Oh, my God, you do that, too?
Yeah.
I've done that.
That's the worst.
Then you have to drive all the way back, and then you have to be like, "I forgot my keys.
" And then they're like, "You did that twice.
" Look at these guys!
The key-forgetting twins!
I'll be right back.
Can I settle up, please?
Dude.
What is your problem?
What?
Becky and Stacy are both really into you, and you're blowing it with them.
And that's making them lose interest in me.
Becky and Stacy are boring.
I need you back there, man.
I've seen you hook up with more trashy chicks in the last year than I can count, all right?
If there was a Tellenson Award for hooking up with trashy chicks all the time, you'd have several of those awards.
You're the king.
You're my hero.
Tom, I'm gonna get out of here.
I'll see you Monday, okay?
Hey.
Hi.
Come on in.
I just wanted to tell you that I didn't go through with it, blackmailing that woman.
I tried, but I just couldn't do it.
Good.
That's a good thing.
It wasn't you.
You know, there was definitely some truth about that thing you said about me and Andy.
No.
What?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
Oh.
Whoa!
Hey!
What the hell?
Oh.
Hi, Leslie.
I thought you were a dude.
The people who win awards aren't always the best people.
I mean, I think Ann and I are really good people, and someday others will see that and we'll get our due.
Would I like to win a Tellenson Award like my mom did?
Sure.
But my dad never won an award, and he was always happy.
He lives in Florida, in a cemetery.
The point is, my mom is alive and I love her.
She's one tough cookie.
That's why everybody calls her "The Iron of Pawnee.
" Fondly.
Yes, I'm married.
But my wife understands that a good politician has to be appealing to the ladies.
The fact that I haven't even gotten close to cheating on her is a disappointment to both of us.
You like the color orange?
Carrots?
You into those?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
This is very exciting.
We are at Saint Joseph's Medical Center because, today, Andy Dwyer is getting his casts off.
It is a great day for Andy, and it's a wonderful day for my subcommittee.
Oh, my God.
Your boobs are dead.
Stop it.
No, they're not.
Yeah.
Yay!
Wow, it's like a sweaty pinata.
Hey, my iPod!
Oh, yeah!
My pirate!
Doctor, if I may, could I keep that cast, please?
It's a highly disgusting request, but I don't see why not.
Thank you.
This is a symbol of new beginnings, a symbol of hope, and of our project.
We will build this park!
It is gonna feel so good to walk again, finally.
Easy!
Oh, no!
Oh, my Oh, no!
Yeah, they might be a little weak at first.
Thank you, guys.
Welcome back into the world of walking, Andy.
Yes.
I just wanted to say Quiet, everyone!
Ann wants to say something.
I wanted to thank you all for being so supportive.
When Andy fell in the pit, I didn't expect anyone in government to reach out to us.
So, thanks.
You're welcome.
Hey, you're welcome, Ann.
Babe, when are you gonna tell them about my show?
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Andy's band is playing a show.
And we want you all to come.
It's gonna be a party, so check your suits at the door.
It's gonna get crazy.
Andy's band is really good, and it's been driving him nuts that he can't play.
He's been writing all these songs about things that are physically near him.
Sandwich!
Are you turkey or ham?
Ham.
Lamp!
Wish you were a lamp that would light up when you get touched What kind of music does your band play?
You know, I don't really like to define it, but it's like Matchbox Twenty meets The Fray.
So, rock.
Well, again, I don't really like to define it.
I totally get what you mean.
So, I would love to come to this thing.
When is it?
Tonight at 8:00.
No!
Tonight?
Yeah.
I can't go.
Why not?
My mom set up this meeting.
It's like a political tête-à-tête with a local bigwig.
Leslie, you're not gonna go?
Come on!
Oh, you guys.
You know how I love mixing work into my personal life.
This guy is important, and he has valuable information that could help us build a park.
But I wanna go to the concert!
Come on!
Play hooky!
Blow off the meeting.
Oh, I wanna go to that concert so bad, but I have to go to the meeting.
I have to go.
But I'll meet up with you guys after the tête-à-tête, I promise.
Hey, Mark, congratulations.
Oh.
Thanks, Nate.
For what?
You got that speed bump thing taken care of.
Finally.
Nice work.
Oh, yeah.
Yay.
There used to be this huge speed bump in the center of town.
It was insane.
So, I decided I wanted to do something about it, and I got it lowered 2 inches.
Apparently, what I can achieve in government can literally be measured.
Hey, Dr. Harris.
Andy's playing a show tonight, and we'd love it if you came by.
I think there's gonna be a good turnout at Andy's show tonight.
He wrote this new song about what happened to him called The Pit.
It's one of those rare songs that rocks really hard, and also informs people about a small public works project.
So, Andy's doing well?
Yeah, he's a little shaky still, but that's to be expected.
Well, not really.
If he had his casts removed two weeks ago, the muscles wouldn't have atrophied so much.
I'm sorry, two weeks ago?
That's when they were scheduled to come off.
But he told me that you told him he should wait.
No.
He rescheduled.
Said it was personal, that he'd explain later, but then he never explained.
I have waited on him hand and foot for two months.
Well, I guess that explains it.
AND Y Hey, what's up, people of Pawnee?
All right!
All right.
Uh In just a minute, Scarecrow Boat is gonna rock it out.
Please be patient while we rock out the equipment setup.
AND Y The band has had a few different names over the years.
We started, we were Teddy Bear Suicide, but then we changed it to Mouse Rat.
Uh.
Then we were God Hates Figs, Department of Homeland Obscurity, Flames for Flames, Muscle Confusion, Nothing Rhymes with Orange, then Everything Rhymes with Orange, Punch Face Champions, Rad Wagon, Puppy Pendulum, Possum Pendulum, Penis Pendulum, Hand Rail Suicide, Angel Snack, Just the Tip, Three Skin Jet Black Pope, we went back to Mouse Rat, and now we are Scarecrow Boat.
God, when I hear myself say Scarecrow Boat out loud, I kind of hate it.
Now, you know that we're gonna be building a park on a residential lot, so, of course we're gonna have to get the zoning codes approved and amended by our city council.
What kind of movies do you like?
Huh?
Uh.
Well, you know, documentaries, political thrillers.
I like all kinds of movies.
Great.
So, I brought some pictures of the lot, and you can tell that the houses are very close to it.
How difficult is re-zoning in your town?
Could you go into detail a little bit about that?
Sure.
Great.
It's refreshing to be with someone who actually likes talking about government issues.
Most of the women I go out with find it boring.
Well, you know, you have to have zoning codes, or else the whole thing could be chaos.
Your mother mentioned that you don't date much.
What?
I've been focusing on my career.
Why do you ask?
I haven't been dating much either since my divorce.
It hasn't been easy.
And I'm coping, but it was tough on the kids.
Not my kids, 'cause they're grown-up, but it was tough on their kids.
Shouldn't bring up my divorce on a first date.
But I feel I can tell you anything.
Uh I think it's going quite well.
And she looks like a young Sandy Duncan.
Hi, Mom.
He thinks we're on a date.
Did you tell him we were on a date?
MARLENE Honey, if I told you it was a date, you never would've gone.
You're not getting any younger.
Well, neither is he.
And he's 62 years old.
Oh.
Just go back in there and finish the dinner.
You don't have to have sex with him if you don't want to.
What?
Are you crazy?
Hi, how are you?
Hey, Parks Department.
Hey, Mark.
This is Beth, my ex-wife Tammy's better-looking sister.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
You guys are together?
Yup.
My ex-wife Tammy cheated on me.
Then we divorced.
Then last week, I ran into her sister Beth here.
Turns out she hates Tammy, too, so we've started dating.
It's like a fairy tale.
Yeah, Tammy stinks.
Brendanawicz!
Hey, Tom.
Hey.
I want you to meet my wife.
Hi.
I'm Wendy Haverford.
Hi.
You're Tom's wife.
Don't hold it against me.
Look at how hot she is.
Isn't that crazy?
And she's a surgeon.
She makes a ton of money!
Bam!
This is Derek.
Cool.
How long have you guys been dating?
We're just friends.
He's like the gayest person I've ever met.
But I make out with him when I'm drunk sometimes.
You know, if you don't wanna talk to me, you can just say so.
I don't wanna talk to you.
Apparently, tonight, I'm the Parks Department's seventh wheel.
This is my oldest son.
He's a very no-nonsense person like yourself.
And this is my youngest.
He's about your age.
Terrific.
So, did you give any more thought to those zoning code questions I asked you?
Oh.
Come on, enough business.
Let's have some fun!
Try some of my chicken.
Oh, no.
That's okay.
Just a taste.
Have a little taste of chicken!
Just a bit!
Just a taste!
Chicken, chicken, chicken!
Mmm.
Delicious, right?
Mmm-hmm.
I really like this restaurant.
Yeah.
It's a great place for a business meeting.
Andy.
Andy.
We need to talk.
Babe, hey.
We're just about to start.
Could you grab me a triple whiskey water?
You would like that, wouldn't you?
Yep.
You have two perfectly good legs.
Get it yourself.
All right.
Hey, guys!
Thanks for coming out.
We're Scarecrow Boat.
This first song is called Menace Ball.
Two, three, four I know you been changing But I been changing, too You say that you've moved on Thank you.
What kind of movies do you like?
You already asked me that.
Oh.
Sorry.
Senior moment.
Hey, am I keeping you from something?
No, no.
Yes.
My friend Andy is playing in a band tonight, and I kind of wanted to go.
Well, if you want to go to the rock show, I don't mind.
Really?
Are you sure?
Sure!
I haven't been to a rock show in a long time.
The last rock show I went to was the Everly Brothers.
Hmm.
You like the Everly Brothers?
They're my favorite rock group.
They're so good.
I am getting very positive signals.
You and me together You and me forever You and me together forever Together forever All right, take five, guys.
I'm gonna go acoustic.
This next song is dedicated to her, my girlfriend, Ann.
I call it Ann.
Ann Hey, the band's really good.
I liked that song Grapple Hound.
Gossip Town?
Right.
My only criticism, I hate the name of the band.
Yeah, they should change their name to Big, Lying Baby.
Or Where's My Sandwich?
Or Don't Forget To Bring Home Beers After Work.
Okay.
Since you brought it up, I'm just gonna say it.
I don't get you and I mean, it doesn't make any sense to me.
I mean, I like Andy a lot.
But there's tons of guys out there who have jobs and who respect you and think you're attractive.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
You mean guys like you No!
for instance?
No, no, no, no, no, not me.
Oh.
Okay.
Good, 'cause, for a second there, I thought you were hitting on me in front of my boyfriend.
No!
Not my style.
Even though you did just call him a big, lying baby.
And I do find you attractive.
So, you are hitting on me.
No.
I'm not.
I promise you.
But if I were, would you be interested?
No.
Okay.
Let me tell you why, because I'm in a crappy mood, and I don't really appreciate what's happening right here.
Number one, you've never been in a relationship that's lasted longer than a week.
Number two, the girls That's fine.
Just you do choose to spend the week with That's enough.
That's enough.
Look, I was not trying to ask you out, I promise.
Well, I'm glad we avoided that.
Pit!
I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in it, the pit Pit!
I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in that pit Thank you very much, everybody!
We are Scarecrow Boat!
No!
Screw it!
We are Mouse Rat!
Thank you very much!
Good night!
Damn it.
I missed it?
Leslie!
Who's your friend?
I'm George.
I'm Leslie's date.
Yes.
He's my date.
George Gernway.
He's the City Manager in Eagleton.
Hi, George Gernway.
I'm Tom Haverford.
This is my wife, Wendy.
She's my age.
Hi.
Hello.
AND Y I have no idea why Ann is upset with me.
But I do know she's too nice to yell at me in front of all these people.
So, I am not leaving this bar.
So, I heard you went to Indiana State.
Yes.
My buddy Todd went there.
Maybe you know him.
What year did you graduate?
Oh!
Todd graduated in 2005, so you probably missed him.
How was your date with Leslie?
We change the band name, and then we send the demo out.
We're completely ready Andy, let's go.
Honey, I'm just debriefing with the band.
It's just gonna be just one second.
Hey!
Hi!
Whoa!
Leslie Knope!
I'm so glad you made it.
You have to meet my band.
Okay.
Hi, band!
Hey.
What's going on?
Oh.
I'm so sorry that I missed your songs.
Is there any way that you guys could do like an encore or something?
An encore.
I like it.
Guys, let's get our stuff out of the boxes.
Let's go.
No, no, forget it.
No, we're going home.
No, don't leave.
I just got here.
Yeah, she's here with her dad.
It'd be kind of rude to not do at least one more song.
Andy.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
Sorry, Leslie.
We're gonna go.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay.
This weekend, guys.
Look.
Dead or asleep?
Dead or asleep?
George.
George!
Oh.
Look at me, out like a light.
I think I should head home now.
Okay.
It was nice to meet you.
It was fun.
I had a nice time.
Don't think I'll go out with her again.
There was just no spark.
How did Leslie meet her boyfriend?
She used to read him books at the senior center.
Wow.
How old is he?
He's six, but he has Benjamin Button Disease.
Whoa.
Hey, who wants to see me climb a tree?
I do!
I do!
Deputy Director Knope.
Where do you think you're going?
Home.
It's been a really crappy night.
Have a beer with me.
I can't believe my mom tried to set me up with an 80-year-old man.
I went to dinner tonight with somebody's grandpa.
You know what?
That guy was too young for you.
You should be dating guys in their early hundreds.
I'm telling you, you should be dating men that Al Roker announces their birthdays.
Hey!
Congratulations are in order.
I heard that you got that speed bump thing through.
Don't make fun of me.
I'm not.
Oh, yeah.
I made a bump into a smaller bump.
It's a great day for America.
What are you talking about?
That thing was a pain in the butt.
You fixed a problem.
That's what we're supposed to do.
Mark and I are really connecting tonight.
Like we connected that night when we made love five years ago.
There's actually a lot of similarities between those two nights.
That time we were also at a bar.
And he was also pretty drunk.
If you could put anything in the park, what would you put in there?
Okay Don't over-think it.
Keep it simple, nice shady trees, lots of grass, benches.
A picnic table?
Sure.
Water feature.
Like, huge rocks to be climbing on.
A play area for the kids.
God, that sounds wonderful.
I would live in that park.
But then you'd be homeless.
Hey, we're closing up.
Oh.
What time is it?
I should go.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
We're getting drinks to go.
Come on.
Beers to go!
Where are we going?
All the bars are closed.
You think I can get my beer bottle in that shopping cart right there?
What?
Mark, don't.
This pit isn't a dump.
Yes, it is.
Look around, Leslie.
I mean, there's crap everywhere.
One beer bottle is not gonna make any difference.
Damn it!
I was so close there!
Yeah, so It was pretty close!
So far to the left!
So far to the left!
You think you can do any better?
No, please.
I don't want anyone to see!
I'm the Deputy Director of Parks You're the Deputy Director of Parks and blah blah You know, nobody's gonna see it.
Go on and chuck it.
Unbelievable!
That's unbelievable!
You missed the entire pit, which is huge, by the way.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You didn't do anything wrong?
Mmm-mmm.
I waited on you hand and foot.
And it was exhausting!
I fed you meals, and you could've had your casts off two weeks ago!
That is not true.
It's not true?
So you're calling Dr. Harris a liar?
Yes.
I'm gonna call Dr. Harris right now.
How about that?
You call him!
You get me on the phone with Dr. Harris.
Yes.
Yes.
I will.
Don't call him right now!
Why?
Because it's late.
Listen, just put the phone down.
Fine!
You want the truth?
Yes.
Could I have gotten my casts off two weeks ago?
Technically, yes.
