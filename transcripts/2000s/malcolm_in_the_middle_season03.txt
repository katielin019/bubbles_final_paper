Let's get some more.

Wow Roxy's sharing a houseboat with Stevie's family on a man-made lake by the power plant.
I don't want to meet the girl that would impress.
Do not touch!
I'm not!
Hal, let me see you bathing suit.
No.
The ones you picked out are too big and baggy.
Baggy is good.
It's less surface area I have to shave.
I like the little ones.
No.
You always pop out.
I do not.
That was one time.
The Kenarbans are conservative people.
We'll be in very close quarters with them.
Get the baggy ones.
Let me show you something.
Not the suit in the egg.
Don't say anything till you see it.
Watch out!
>  Dewey Can I see that spear gun?
Sure.
Now, don't tell me this doesn't do somethin' for ya.
I-I-I'm sorry.
I thought you were my wife.
You see, my wife has the exact same shape   So when you and I get back, you know, if you wanted, maybe I could give you a call.
Maybe.
Psst!
> Psst!
Psst!
Whoa.
Look at that guy.
Psst!
Psst!
Do you know him?
Who?
That nutcase?
Of course not.
Help me choose a surf board.
OK.
Oh For the love of!
Oh!
Excuse me.
Oh!
God, it's not me, it's the suit.
I am a normal person!
I'm here with my family.
My son is Malcolm!
Come with me.
I know how this looks but I'm telling you Malcolm!
No!
No!
This is a complete misunderstanding.
Dude, where were you?
If Spangler finds out you blew off drill practise, he'll kill you.
I'm not afraid of him now.
Why aren't you in uniform?
I'm leavin'.
I'm outta here.
You can't just leave.
Yes, I can.
I just turned 18, I'm legally an adult and no-one can tell me what to do!
I'm outta here!
You're not gonna graduate?
!
I'm going to Alaska.
Francis, it's crazy up there.
You can make $45 an hour working on oil rigs or logging camps and you don't even need a diploma.
Wait!
$45 an hour?
That's with room and board.
You work a couple of years and you're set for life.
Somethin' to remember me by.
Do you realise how close your father came to being a registered sex offender?
!
A registered sex offender!
And for what?
For some trampy girl?
Mom, please!
I feel terrible.
I completely understand what I did.
I sold out my own father for a girl.
It's the worst thing I've ever done.
We both agree I'm a terrible person.
For some girl you don't even know!
Who wouldn't even give you the time of day!
That's your gratitude?
!
Maybe I'm the good one after all.
Here, Mom.
For your throat.
I put a little honey in it.
One vacation a year and this is how you start it!
You go and make it right!
Hello?
Dad's probably not that mad at me.
I mean, it's not like I shoved him in the squad car.
Dad, can I talk to you?
Er, no.
not right now.
I'm kinda busy.
Reese, can you help me?
Sure, Dad.
I love to be helpful.
Can you close the door?
Absolutely not, Francis!
"You're not listening".
I can make $45 an hour.
That's more than you or Dad makes.
You are going to graduate from high school.
Why spend the tuition?
It's a waste of money.
We both know I'm failing.
OK, now we both know.
Francis, you are going to stay in school until you graduate and that's all there is to it.
If you flunk out, you'll do another year!
You just can't stand the fact I'd make more money than you!
Argh!
Whoa.
That was close.
Oh, look at all this lovely scenery and nature.
This will be wonderful.
Dear, did you pack my hat?
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
You should have asked me to.
No problem.
I'll just create one out of newspaper.
Everything OK?
Everything's wonderful.
We're on vacation.
The whole drive up here Dad wouldn't look at me.
I just wish I could take those two minutes back.
That's the King Of The Seas?
No TV!
There's no TV!
There's no TV!
There's no TV!
There's your TV.
I don't see any TV.
Excuse me.
OK.
Dad, I'll help you with that.
No, no.
I've got it.
Dad, please.
Wait.
Come on.
Talk to me, please.
OK, fine  Oh, I wanted to wait till this afternoon but what the heck?
Check this out.
It's a Cavanaugh.
Remember last year you saw a picture of a father and a son fishing together and said, "I'd like to try that"?
Yeah Yeah, well, I kept lookin' at that picture and thinkin' about you and me, and I started putting a little money away, and, you know, I, I got this for ya.
Oh, man, you wouldn't believe how hard this week has been.
Every time I looked at you I wanted to spill the beans but This is why you wouldn't talk to me?
We'll take the Dingy out and do some fishin'.
Just the two of us.
Great.
See you on board, Skipper.
Hey, guess who's still the good one.
Do you?
I see it too.
Hey, boys, what are you doing?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
Where did you get the boat?
We stole it from our spirit camp.
We're going for cigarettes.
Spirit camp?
So, you girls are?
Cheerleaders.
Bad!
Cheerleaders!
Yeah.
We haven't seen any boys in, like, six weeks.
Even you guys are starting to look good.
Wait.
Where are you guys going?
Follow us and find out.
Get the boat!
Ready to go fishing, son?
Now?
Yeah.
We're catching everyone's dinner.
Now, don't you take this personally, alright?
This is a special thing with Malcolm and me, just this once.
Too bad you can't come with us Too bad we're taking the boat Oh Oh No.
At least Reese and Stevie are as bored and miserable as I am.
Remember to call me ..
Snoop .
This is great.
To just relax with adults.
"Suffocate".
Good for you, Abe.
"Cry baby".
I believe that's two words, dear.
OK, then.
Just "baby".
I heard what happened.
My, my, my.
All that splintered wood and broken glass.
I brought you something.
What's that?
A hammer.
I expect you to repair the case.
You'll find lumber in the common room.
I have a nine-inch gash in my leg!
Hmm That's quite a handicap.
Cadet, you damaged school property!
You are the one responsible for repairing it.
Consider it a character-building lesson.
I didn't damage anything.
That was negligence.
The phone wasn't properly connected to the wall!
It's unfair!
I decide what's fair around here.
But wait.
Maybe I've been hasty.
No.
Now that I've reconsidered, the decision stands.
You will fix the damage by the end of the week.
That is all, Cadet.
Dewey, you have to let go of the rope.
You're all sunburnt.
No.
Just let go.
It's gonna be dark soon.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
Just open your fingers.
But I'll fall.
That's the point.
Dewey, don't think, just do it.
Just let go!
No!
Oh, for crying out loud!
You let go of that rope and you come in for dinner!
Come on, honey!
No.
Ow!
I'll make French fries.
Ow!
Your favourite.
Ice cream.
You know you love ice cream.
And it was wriggling and fighting.
And finally I got it on the hook.
That was one helluva worm.
I was sure I'd catch something with it.
Dewey, pass the salt, please.
Where'd you get that shiner?
Mom It was horrible.
It was like we were there for hours.
It was so boring.
What are you smiling about?
I like these potatoes.
You guys went to the camp?
Oh, man.
What was it like?
Imagine 100 fat guys fallin' downstairs knocking over old ladies.
Multiply that by 10 and you're not even close.
Until today ..
I'd have traded my life ..
for anybody's No way.
It's Mom's.
If it were Mom's, would I do this?
That was delicious.
I am so sorry about Abe.
What do you mean?
Oh, you're sweet to pretend, but I know he's ruining the vacation with his pouting and sarcastic little digs.
If it's bothering you, talk to him.
Sure is a beautiful night.
You're right!
Anything is better than this!
Oh, Malcolm, better hit the hay.
We're getting up early tomorrow.
Nightie ..
night  I'll tell you what the problem is.
I hate this boat, I hate this place and everything about this vacation!
Then, why didn't you say anything?
What difference would it have made?
This trip was your idea!
And God knows, whatever Kenny wants, Kenny gets!
Stop behaving like a total ass!
I could be sitting in a suite in Hawaii right now!
They can't afford that.
Pardon me for going to college and earning a decent living!
Should I drive a crappy car cos they do, too?
!
They cannot hear me!
And even if they could, they'd understand it's just my puckish sense of humour.
Turn on the radio.
Yeah.
What?
Nothing.
I didn't want it to come to this but there's only so far I can be pushed.
You don't have to convince me.
This is the kind of injustice the Alabama legal system addresses.
Just sign here.
And we'll need your parents' signatures at the bottom.
Great!
I'm a notary as well as a lawyer so I can have this expedited.
Great.
Hello?
Well, he's in with a client.
Can he call you back?
Mom, please!
We can't watch Dewey!
We already have plans.
Now they include your brother.
Mom!
This isn't a negotiation!
Take your brother with you and have fun!
!
!
Now, remember, this is a magic buoy.
Mermaid's are drawn to it and they'll grant your every wish.
But they won't show up if there's more than one person here.
Just leave.
Don't insult me.
Hi, Malcolm.
Me and my naked friends got tired of waiting for you.
You don't want Reese to have all the fun, do you?
What happened?
Did you catch something?
No.
We're not gonna catch anything.
I know.
This is really awful, isn't it?
I don't think there's a darn fish in this whole lake.
You know what?
It doesn't matter.
It's just nice bein' out here with you.
Dad.
Mmm?
You know the other day at the store when I pretended not to know you?
Yeah.
That was a new low.
Well, there was this girl.
Really?
I'm sorry.
I know.
Ooh!
Looks like you got a nibble!
OK, set the rope.
Let him run.
OK, reel him in.
Reel him in.
Look at that, huh?
!
Come to Poppa, baby.
You betcha!
Oh, yeah!
That's a striper!
Look at that beauty!
Way to go, Malcolm!
Thanks, Dad!
Oh, look at that!
Huh Isn't this your brother's shirt?
Ugh!
Why?
Ugh!
You are in so much trouble!
I know!
I can't believe it either.
Hi, Dewey!
If you'll excuse me, dear, I think I'll take a nap on my luxurious foam bed.
How long you gonna let this go on?
I tried to talk to him.
It didn't help.
Maybe you came on too strong.
Start by apologising.
You don't have to mean it.
You have one day of vacation left.
You wanna spend it like this?
Alright.
I can swallow my pride.
You think you're on some picnic?
!
With your long suffering sad eyes and your pouting?
You are a big, over-indulged momma's boy!
You are an uptight, impossible-to-please, control freak!
I can't take it any more!
What will you do about it, momma's boy?
!
Huh?
!
What's the big momma's boy gonna do about it?
!
Oh, my God I'm sorry.
I thought you were fighting.
I didn't see anything!
Oh, dear God!
Three weeks of slave labour.
My relationship with Dad will never be the same and I can't stop smiling.
Dewey.
Remember when we were both stuck on the buoy and you said you wanted to be a ventriloquist?
Well, I thought we could do it together.
Thanks, Dad.
You're welcome, son.
Oh, my God!
What is it?
It's Francis!
He quit school.
He's on his way to Alaska!
That's ridiculous.
He can't just leave school.
He needs our permission.
No, he doesn't.
He got himself legally emancipated.

{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Leaving so soon, cadet?
Sir, by statute 614 of the Alabama Legal Code I am officially emancipated and considered an adult.
An adult who no longer chooses to attend Marlin Academy.
I have copies of the documents if you want to see them again.
Oh, no need!
I'm sure everything was done on the up and up.
But let me tell you something, cadet.
In all my years at this academy I have never had a student who was more bull headed, more committed to avoid learning at all costs.
A cadet who's constant byword was insubordination.
Thank you, cadet.
What?
Before you came to this academy I was bored, uninspired, ..
and this close to retiring.
But your insolence and stupidity have been the irritating grain of sand around which has formed the pearl of my renaissance.
I like me again.
Cadet!
As a thanks I want you to have ..
this.
Normally these are reserved for cadets who have distinguished themselves or whose parents have donated a building but you've left your mark here in your own way.
So, what the heck!
Wow!
Sir, this is great.
Farewell, cadet.
Thank you so much.
Careful that's razor # Yes, no, maybe # I don't know # Can you repeat the question?
# You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # Life is unfair # Normally I dread the first day of school.
Mum's been on such a rampage about Francis it's a relief be here.
Thank God ..
summer's over.
Hello, babies.
How's baby school, babies?
Didn't high school start a half hour ago?
If I'm on time they'll expect it every day.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Hi, Reese.
This is Gus.
He's in the lead to replace you as school bully.
He gives a wedgie that'll knock your socks off.
I'm not just saying that cos he's got me in a head lock.
Grab your wrist and stave your fingers.
You'll get better leverage.
You listen to him.
He's the man.
I've completed the research on our new teacher if anyone's interested.
Lionel Herkabe.
Born July 8th, 1963.
Parents, John and Ida.
Notice anything?
He was a Krelboyne.
We won't have to talk down to him.
Finally, someone who knows our pain.
Bentley.
Gifted High.
Princeton.
Harvard Business.
Why's he teaching?
Well, there was some unpleasantness.
He quit a government think tank to start a dot.com.
One time net worth 200 million.
Now 137 dollars.
Here he comes!
Here he comes!
Who's Dabney?
Me, sir.
I took the liberty of ordering you a decaf soy latte.
Let me guess.
Emotionally needy.
Closet bed-wetter.
You get no affection at home so you'll be seeking it from me.
Look elsewhere, son.
Who's the anal-retentive outsider ..
with repressed matricidal tendencies?
Yo, sir!
Me, sir!
Please, stop.
As you may or may not know I was once one of you, a Krelboyne.
And I'm sure I would have made the same lame attempt to ingratiate myself to the new soft-headed thick-wit teaching my class.
I've been there.
I've been coddled and preened.
"Oh, you're a genius".
"You can do anything you set your mind to.
It must be easy being you".
Well, bull!
All that gets you is an ex-wife and 14 million dollars in debt.
I won't let you fall into the trap society has set for you.
Playtime is over, children!
You've had a free ride so far.
It's time somebody challenged you, tested your mental limits!
I don't have a teaching certificate from a two-year community college like most of the people I said hello to this morning in the teachers lounge but I'll muddle through with my double doctorate from Harvard.
This is a test!
Correct.
You have 20 minutes.
There are six essay questions.
I'm sorry, I thought this was the gifted class.
Begin!
Thanks for the ride.
Are you sure about this Alaska thing?
Absolutely.
I heard Alaska's a hole.
Are you kidding?
Cruise ships go there!
For six weeks in the summer.
Isn't it dark the rest of the year?
I don't have to justify myself to you or anyone.
That's why I got emancipated, OK?
OK.
Good luck with your parents.
Well, they had a week to think about it.
Let's see how they take it.
You!
You!
You ungrateful son of a This wasn't meant to hurt you!
All I'm saying is you can get your diploma first then do what you want.
It's all about maximising your options.
Take in the long view.
Sorry about the closer.
Nonsense.
I wouldn't have taught you if I didn't want you to use it.
What do I always say?
The nards are fair game.
The nards are fair game!
Sometimes you're presented with an opportunity you can't pass up.
Understand?
I'm not the one to worry about.
I know.
I wanna get this straight with mom.
That's why I came here.
OK, then.
Honey!
Your son has something to say to you.
Huh!
I didn't know the Henderson's painted their house.
I have your test results.
You all got A's.
But, since this is the gifted class, I also factored in ..
cogency of argument, economy of language and penmanship, which enabled me to do this.
What is that?
A ranking board.
I thought you said we all got A's.
Oh, you did.
But some of you got better A's than others.
But we all still have A's?
Of course.
So, er, what does being number one get you?
Nothing!
Just the knowledge that you are number one.
Or that you are not number one.
Yes, number five?
It's Dabney, sir.
I know.
What is it number five?
I forgot.
What a jerk.
Is that what we're gonna turn out like?
If I ever start acting like that you have to promise to kill me.
No!
No more death pacts.
Don't worry about it.
The only way that stupid board can have an effect on us is if we let it.
Those numbers mean nothing.
What are you doing?
Nothing!
You were studying?
No, I wasn't.
My book just fell open at this page.
You know I'm really not hungry.
I think I left my recess stuff in my locker.
My God!
High school is awesome!
They have an entire room for detention.
They put you in with juniors and seniors.
Some of them have records.
It's really inspiring.
What are you looking at?
Francis.
He's still out there?
Yeah, he's eating out of the bird-feeder.
Who's shoes are these?
Who left their shoes in the living-room?
They're mine.
Sorry.
You're right, you're sorry!
Leaving your shoes around like you don't care!
I hope you like walking to school in your socks!
I said sorry.
I've heard sorry before!
I don't think so.
OK.
I tell you what we're gonna do.
From now on when you wanna wear shoes you check them out.
Sign them in.
Sign them out.
Just like a library.
Clean up those toys!
Oh!
Oh, thanks.
It's freezing.
It's good to see you.
I've missed you.
Ow!
What's that for?
!
Emancipation?
What, you're divorcing the family now?
How could you do this to mom?
She left me no choice.
Ow!
We've done a lot of bad things to mom but we've never abandoned her.
I'm not abandoning her!
I'm just going to Alaska!
That's 5,000 miles away!
It is not 5,000 miles?
Are you serious?
Oh, my God!
It's gonna take me forever to get up there!
Then, don't go.
Guys, I'm not doing this to hurt anybody, I just I really think this is my best chance to make something of myself.
Tell it to mom.
I can't.
She won't talk to me.
She's being so immature.
In the meantime I'm stuck outside in the freezing cold.
Hey, would it be alright if I slept in here tonight?
You do like your whites, don't you?
Of course.
But look!
It's grey.
And look at this.
This stain's been washed in.
If you want really white whites, try Vanish Oxi Action Crystal White.
One scoop and you see the difference in just one wash.
Look what it's doing in your machine.
Drop your stain over this.
Look at it go!
This is good!
And it's perfect for all your washable whites.
She was right.
Vanish Oxi Action Crystal White.
Certainly the whale represents the search for God.
But that could be limiting.
We could say it was the search for the self.
Melville could be considered a pre-existentialist.
You can't deny the whale could be the search for truth which has been a theme throughout his whole oeuvre.
You can't overlook the fact that it is a whale which was the biggest industry in the 19th century.
The oil was used in lamps, soaps and even cosmetics.
Today whaling is outlawed but many Aleutian islanders are legally allowed to harvest whales for ..
ritual purposes.
But I digress!
Wow!
Nine places.
That's gotta be a record.
OK, on to new business.
This Friday Principal Littledove will be dropping by for an evaluation.
I think he'll be very impressed with what he sees.
I don't think he'll understand it but his tiny brain will have the dim perception of the progress you can make when students are properly motivated.
Now, who would like to sink their teeth into some Bernoulli equations?
Come on, guys.
If we don't let the rankings get to us they mean nothing!
Easy for you to say, number one.
I have a name!
We all have names!
Oh, my God!
I can't remember mine!
This is ridiculous!
School used to be the one place where you were happy and Herkabe has taken that away from you.
That stupid board is ruining our lives!
We can't let him do that!
What choice do we have?
We have the choice that people have had for centuries.
We can choose to fail.
Like the French?
You mean we take ..
today's test?
No, we don't take it ..
we nuke it!
Every answer wrong!
No complete sentences!
No punctuation!
And we use number three pencils.
You can't rank zeroes.
Brilliant!
He'll have no choice but to throw out his system.
We'll be free!
I'm very disappointed in you.
Everyone else, nice job.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
My hand wouldn't let me.
I regret nothing!
Interesting gambit but the lemmings didn't follow you off the cliff.
When you spend some time in the real world you realise you can't fight the system.
And now, ..
I'm the system.
Don't worry, I just let the air out.
We can talk while I put on your spare.
I'm sorry I had to resort to this but you have to give me five minutes so we can talk.
We can talk over the music.
You can't drive on a flat!
You're gonna ruin your rims!
That was a red light!
You might want to notice my entire opening paragraph is a palindrome.
You might want to notice my formatting.
What's this?
Irrigation techniques of pre Roman society and how they helped advance western civilisation.
I thought we were just studying Mesopotamian farming.
We were.
I used that as a start on how their influences spread through the Egyptians, the Carthaginians, through the whole ancient world.
I think you'll be happy with this.
Very nice, number 12.
It's nice to see a little effort put forth while some are content to do the absolute minimum.
So, he wants ..
to play.
Ho-ho, we'll play, alright.
What is it we're playing?
# "Pump It Up" - Elvis Costello # I've been on tenterhooks # Ending in dirty looks # Listening to the muzak # Thinking about this and that # She'll say that's that # I don't want to chitter-chat # Turn it down a little bit # Or turn it down flat Pump it up # When you don't really need it # Pump it up Until you can feel it # Hey!
# Pump it up # Until you can feel it # Pump it up When you don't really need it # Don't really need it # Don't really need it # OK.
I think we're ready to show Principal Littledove what motivation can accomplish.
Well done, class.
You know, maybe we should just put our heads down and take a rest for a moment, shall we?
Yes?
Did you know I can count to a million by prime numbers?
I can, too!
So can I!
It's easy!
That's not necessary.
Two, three Five, seven Now by hundreds.
101, 211, 307 Seven!
No!
That is enough!
No!
Where are you going, number three?
It's hot!
It's hot and I'm stupid!
I'm stupid, too!
Everybody please remain seated!
I'm nothing!
I'm invisible!
Boy, that's quite a show for your first week here.
You were right.
You can't beat the system.
But you sure can break it.
I love you guys.
I'll write you when I get there, OK?
Someday when you come back and you're unemployed and have no place to live, ..
you can come stay at my castle.
Thanks, bud.
He's leaving.
He just wants to talk to you.
Just hear him out.
Lois!
This has got to stop!
He's going very far away and you're not gonna see him for a long time.
Honey, there are moments in life that you just don't get back ..
and I know you.
If you do not deal with this now it will haunt you for ever.
Fine.
I've lost a son but gained a baby.
I tried.
I know.
Are you sure this is what you want?
Well, it better be.
< Francis.
I'm listening.
This is what you get for the way you treated me!
I'm going to Alaska and you'll be left without a son!
And the way you treated me is now a matter of public record!
I treated you?
!
I've sacrificed for you and you've caused us nothing but pain!
You want pain?
I've got your scars, baby!
Three years in that school - We went without for that school!
Oh!
Maybe I should thank you?
Thank you for making my life hell!
Living hell?
You've been a problem since you were born!
I'm outta here!

{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
What are you doing?
We've started showering in gym class.
# Yes, no # Maybe # I don't know # Can you repeat the question # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # Life is unfair #  Could you pass the peas, please?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hal?
Alright, boys.
That's enough.
For once could we have a civilised conversation during dinner free of sound effects?
It's not asking too much for us to have some nice dinner conversation.
Malcolm, how was school?
History class was cool.
Tell us about it.
Jimmy Perkins kicked the crap out of Fred Nason.
He beat up Fred Nason?
He's huge!
Fred knocked Jimmy's hat off and Jimmy punched him in the face five times in a row in a second!
Fred fell and he started hitting him.
It was way cool!
Jimmy Perkins is crazy.
I told you, crazy beats big every time.
So, how was your day, dear?
Hey, how's Alaska?
Where are you?
You were meant to be here already!
No-one will pick me up, I ran out of money and had to work for a week.
There's a serial killer loose in Idaho who looks just like me.
I don't know how much longer they'll hold the job.
"I'm almost there"!
Do I take the provincial highway 99 or the 27 to provincial highway 12?
What?
!
I'm near to British Columbia.
I'm in Bellingham, Washington.
Francis, you're 2,000 miles away!
What?
!
No way!
I've just exchanged all my money for Alaskan dollars!
There's no such thing as Alaskan dollars!
Sir!
Are you almost finished with that?
What have you got in mind?
Will you watch the boys next Tuesday night?
I've joined a book club.
You don't wanna do that.
I joined a record club.
They hounded me for years.
It's not that sort of club.
This is women from school.
Adults discussing books.
Oh.
I live in a house filled with boys.
I listen to boy talk and boy noises.
I need to spend some time with females.
Mmm-hmm.
When I see them they invite me to do things and I never go.
Yeah?
I need to do this for my sanity.
Yeah.
Yes!
Yes.
Are you even listening to me?
Of course I am.
Here's what I think.
It's a great idea.
It's about time you did something like this.
You have a brilliant and beautiful mind that needs challenging.
I hope those women can keep up with you.
Make a wish.
I left the phone number on the counter.
The dishes are in the sink.
The batteries from the remote are in the smoke alarm.
Just for tonight!
Will you relax, honey?
You're off the clock!
This is your night out!
Just enjoy yourself, huh?
Yeah, Mom.
Stop worrying.
Have fun.
Take the garbage cans to the kerb tonight.
Stop worrying!
Go have some fun!
Now?
No, let's let Mom get a few blocks away.
Right.
This could be a trick.
What are you talking about?
We've got fireworks buried outside.
We'll dig them up while Mom's gone.
Tracy Hines is having a party.
We're not invited.
Our justice will be swift but fair.
We'll be fine!
'I don't want to screw this up.
' 'Lois needs time to herself.
She deserves a night out.
' 'She'll have fun and will come home happy.
' 'I just have to keep the boys under control.
What am I talking about?
' 'They're good kids.
What am I talking about?
They're monsters!
' 'They'll destroy everything and then ruin Lois's night!
Then she'll feel like we can't be trusted on our own!
She'll never want a night out again and it will all be my fault!
' We're going out back.
You're not going anywhere!
Stay in your room all night with the door shut!
Now go!
Go!
Hmmm!
This cheddar is wonderful!
It is good.
So, I really liked the book!
Really?
Oh, Karen, let's have some more wine!
The voice of the narrator was shifted from character to character.
Oh, I'll just have to take your word on that.
I didn't read the book.
Oh, was anyone else confused by those flashbacks?
Am I the only one who read the book?
Actually, Lois, we don't make it mandatory to read the book.
What?
I mean, we're all busy.
That shouldn't prevent us from enjoying a relaxing evening once in a while.
Lois, don't you feel you deserve one night away from the bickering, the yelling and the TV blaring?
Away from all the stupid little problems that can't seem to be solved without you?
A little more.
Thank you!
Thank you for stopping!
I'm glad to.
The name's Roy.
Francis.
It's freezing!
I've been standing there for six hours!
People were flipping me off as they drove by.
Why would they do that?
How far are you going?
Mamu.
I'm going to Green River.
I can take you almost the whole way.
Really?
It's taken me the last 3 days to get 20 miles!
Thank you.
You OK?
Yeah, it's just people aren't very nice!
You want some coffee?
Yes!
My Mom and I were screaming at each other.
She's finding time to tell the cab driver which route to take!
She's a control freak!
She sounds like she's afraid.
What would my mom have to be afraid of?
If she doesn't control every aspect of her life or the lives of the ones she cares about that horrible things will happen.
What horrible things?
Her oldest son moving 5,000 miles away from her.
Alright, you got me there.
You're pretty smart.
I'm on the road 18 hours a day.
Gives me a lot of time to think about things, people, why they do the things they do.
I'm a wannabe psychiatrist.
I'm glad to be out.
I've got a line that I won't cross.
If anybody tries to push me across it, I'm gone.
Everybody's got a line.
But what's interesting is everyone's line is different.
It moves.
Look at your situation here.
It is freezing cold, there's no other cars on the road Hypothetically, if I said put on a curly red wig or I'll throw you out, are you gonna go back out into the cold?
That's ridiculous!
You can't use a silly example You're kidding?
OK!
You haven't made a sound in half an hour!
What's going on in here?
Nothing.
I expect perfect behaviour tonight.
If you try anything, ANYTHING AT ALL, I will be on you like a rainbow on an oil slick!
'Good.
You sent them a message.
Fired the shot across their bow.
' 'Now they know who's in charge!
' Maybe I was too harsh.
If the boys push back they might do something ten times worse and spoil everything for Lois!
'Don't go soft!
' 'All these boys understand is the iron fist!
' No, I need to get them on my side!
Dewey, be lookout while we dig up the fireworks.
What's going on with Dad?
Maybe he's dealing with something at work.
I hope he'll be OK.
At his age carrying around that tension can't be good for you.
Oh!
Dad's here!
Who wants ice cream?
I come home after work after a ten-hour shift and I see my boys and they're covered with grass and paint and all they can say is, "Where's dinner"?
Too much is expected of us.
Our society is just so screwed up.
pick something and go with it.
A housewife, a career woman, sex slave.
But now you're supposed to do everything and it's impossible!
Unless you're Lillian Miller.
Yeah!
If it weren't for me my family would be living in trees, eating berries.
Do they appreciate what I do for them?
Nooooo!
Lillian's family surprised her with a trip to Spain!
No kidding!
I discovered a two-inch-long hair growing out of my shoulder.
How long has it been there?
I don't have time to put myself right in the morning.
Lillian Miller brought 20 home-made cakes to the school-bake sale.
I had those!
They were delicious!
The woman just cooks like a god but she never puts on a pound!
You can't be 45 and still be a size 2!
Those are sizes for children!
And Lillian!
Ladies, I just realised something.
Society isn't making us miserable.
Hell, we're society!
No, no!
Every single one of our problems can be traced back to that tight-assed overachieving marathon-running master chef ..
Lillian Miller!
# Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parlez-vous # Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parlez-vous # She got the palm and the croix de guerre # For washing soldiers' underwear # Inky dinky, parlez-vous # Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What?
It's hinky dinky parlez-vous.
That's what I said.
You said inky dinky.
You've got to start over.
I'm not starting over.
It's freezing!
I can barely feel my lips!
# Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parlez-vous Parlez- # Thanks for the ice-cream, Dad.
You're welcome, Dewey.
Don't worry about this mess.
I'll take care of it.
Just sit there and relax.
Alright, what the hell is going on?
I think he's feeling guilty about something.
Maybe we can exploit it!
How?
Send Dewey in there crying about the train Mom put in the attic.
Mom didn't put a train in the attic.
Exactly!
When he's up there, we can dig up the fireworks.
Dewey, we need you to cry.
It's gotta be the right kind of crying.
Not sobbing, more of a penetrating whining sound.
Give me a moment.
OK, that was a good idea.
They're happy.
I've got them motivated to behave themselves and Lois is gonna see that I can handle them without her.
'Are you kidding?
You've gone soft!
' 'You've totally lost their respect.
Lois isn't gonna like this!
' Come on!
They're under control.
'What if they aren't?
What if they're pretending to behave so they can set you up?
'  Occupy them.
Keep them busy so they don't have time to get in trouble.
How am I gonna keep them busy?
You better find a way.
> Dad, Dewey really wants you - Boys!
Let's spend a little time together.
We can I know!
We can do some callisthenics!
What?
!
You boys love to exercise!
But I just ate a ton of ice cream.
You are starting to get a little flabby.
I'm too full.
When you start moving you'll feel better!
Let's go!
One.
Two.
One.
Two.
One.
Two.
One.
Two.
Stupid!
Stupid!
It was a terrible idea!
It was a great idea!
A great idea poorly executed.
Terrible idea.
Terrible execution.
Why don't you just lock them in the bathroom until Lois gets home?
Look at that house.
It's perfect!
No, no, no!
We didn't come here for a mindless vandalism.
We came to screw up her car!
See how she feels when she's late for car pool like a real person!
She probably won't even be able to get out of bed on a morning!
This time next year she's gonna be living in a trailer with little ceramic donkey in the front yard.
Shhh!
Shhh!
Whoopsy!
Whoops!
Will you shhh?
!
She's wearing pearls to make cookies?
!
Oh, God!
Those cookies smell good!
Let's kill her and eat them!
Quick!
Oh, one of us should probably know something about cars.
It doesn't matter!
Just pull some of the wires!
Let's get out of here!
Karen!
Karen!
You've gotta stop!
Karen!
You've gotta settle down!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Karen, why don't you see if you can say the alphabet backward?
Z, y, x, w, v, u, t, s, r, q, p, o, m, n, l, k, j, i, h, g, f, e, d, c, b, a!
I've been pulled over a few times.
Hey!
Lillian's gone!
What do you mean, gone?
RUN!
It's a pointless exercise!
You haven't proven a thing.
You haven't determined what my limits are.
This hasn't bothered me and if you think it has, the joke is on you!
Clench.
" ..
10-31 and 6-42, That's the third time he drove down that alley!
He knows we're in here!
This is gross!
I can't believe I'm wearing open-toed shoes.
I can't believe I'm hiding from the cops in a dumpster!
I just wanted to talk about books.
Oh, and it was such a good book, too!
The first shadowing was effective without being heavy-handed.
The characters were flawed but compelling and the entire story was brimming with insight into the character's condition!
But how did you find time to read it?
Your family sounds so horrible!
I was lying!
I made all that stuff up so that I would fit in!
They're wonderful!
I mean, they're idiots!
But at least they try.
I wanted it to be the happiest night!
Look what I did with it!
What are you doing?
You'll see.
Go home to your family and hug them for me.
They sound wonderful!
Hey, piggy!
Over here!
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy!
< Come on, show me what you got!
< I'm supposed to be afraid of an electric shaver?
!
<  Aaaaarh!
"..
lighter than most minerals".
Why is he making us watch this about salt?
Would you rather be locked in the bathroom?
Or chased by the monster?
Do something!
I'm trying!
Every time we make a move he's ahead of us.
He's impossible to predict!
With Mom you get a little consistency.
Dad's operating on a whole other plane.
Hey, you put salt on French fries!
Ground them!
Cut off their food supply!
They just need love!
Give them the belt!
Make them fear you!
These are precious years!
Get in the car and go.
SHUT UP!
OK, that's it.
I am going to take a bath.
I'm asking you boys one last time to behave.
Not for me but for your mother.
After all she does for you one night of peace shouldn't be too much to ask for.
So if you love her, you will do this for her.
Wow, I've never had anyone empty the box before!
I'm outta props!
I was bored with your experiment at first but I admit, I learned a lot about myself.
Who am I to judge people for the choices they make?
From now on I'm gonna be a bit more understanding and a lot more humble.
Wanna stop for some dinner?
What, like this?
Sure!
Why not like this?
Have you thought about writing a book?
I'm sure - Hey, Merna!
What time's the pageant?
Fluffy's collar?
Mom said he ran away!
Get out of there, Dewey!
Tracy should have invited us!
This is what you get for being rude.
We'll hide these in the closet, then we'll cover up the hole and by the time Mom's home, we'll be sleeping.
Boys!
FIREWORKS?
!
FIREWORKS?
!
Omph!
How did she?
I don't know!
You boys are in so much trouble!
I can't leave you alone for a second!
Next time I'll chain you to the floor!
We tell you to behave - you don't even pretend to listen!
You might as well cut off your ears and throw them in trash!
You are grounded for the next month!
"Get down on the ground with your hands behind your head".
While you're being punished I hope your friends are doing all sorts of fun stuff because you won't be doing any of it!
You are gonna suffer!
I should get out there.
Nah, you'll just screw it up.
Good call.

BELL ELECTRONIC FANFARE New Sure Men Absolute.
Agh!
Future-ready protection.
You would not!
I would, too!
No clothes, go across the street and ring Mrs Conlan's door bell.
Yeah, I would do it but you don't have ten bucks.
Dewey.
Ah-ah!
No underwear, no clothes at all.
Of course.
What are you doing?
You said no clothes.
I'll be right back, losers.
Never thought he'd do it.
I guess he outsmarted us.
You opened her gate, right?
Of course.

And unmounted.
But if Are you listening?
Oh, my God!
Sara Coleman is so beautiful!
The way she runs her hand through her hair.
And that smile.
You look at her and you can't even see anyone else.
Every day, you do this.
Ask her out.
Come on, Stevie!
Sara would never go out with me!
She's smart, cool, good-looking.
If we went out it would make me happy.
It won't happen.
I am destined to be the most miserable person on Earth.
Boo ..
hoo.
Shut up!
Look, it's complicated, OK?
You don't just walk up to a girl and say, "Hey, I like you"!
You'd look like an idiot.
Sara wants to know if you like her.
What?
He likes her!
She likes him, too.
Remember yesterday when we were sitting and we got a drink of water?
Then we sat around again.
We should totally do that again.
OK.
Look at me, it's official.
I have a girlfriend!
I'm officially someone's boyfriend.
Watch this.
I can do that any time I want!
I hate this.
This is where we have to split up so my family won't see us.
I'll miss you.
You're a really good kisser.
Thanks.
Bye.
Thanks.
What does that mean?
What's wrong with the way I kiss?
Are my lips too wet?
Maybe they're too dry.
I don't see why she couldn't just return the compliment!
My God!
I'm the worst boyfriend ever!
OK, just calm down.
I'm a good boyfriend.
She wouldn't be my girlfriend if I wasn't.
I have a girlfriend!
You don't understand.
All I did was take a doughnut out of a dumpster.
How is that stealing?
I had to fight a cat to get it!
The restaurant owner wants to press charges.
Look, I know the guy.
He's a bit of a hothead, but I promise you he'll lose interest in four or five days.
Four or five days?
I have to start a logging job and I'm late as it is!
It won't be bad.
Three meals a day courtesy of my wife.
You look like you could use some home cooking.
What would you like for dinner, chicken or a nice porterhouse steak?
Porterhouse, I guess.
Oh, you're gonna love her cooking!
Well, thank you!
At first I had no idea what was going on.
Then I realised I was looking at a 4-25 requisition form.
Shelby had filled it out thinking it was a 4-28.
This isn't interesting, is it?
No, it is!
You just need to know what a 4-25 form is!
You see - Dewey, how was your day?
I got a new friend, his name's Ronnie.
He just moved here.
He's got a Nintendo, a Playstation, and a nanny.
He's really rich.
Well, nice to meet you, Ronnie.
No, he's real!
I can make real friends, too!
Of course.
Don't be frustrated if it takes you longer than other boys.
Ronnie is real!
Reese!
What are you doing?
!
Malcolm's got a girlfriend!
What?
Son, is this true?
Damn!
I was saving that for report card day!
She's not We're just friends.
Malcolm, look at me!
Oh, my God, it's true!
Malcolm, no!
You do not do this yet!
I saw them behind the 7-11 French kissing.
That's with tongue.
Don't you wanna go to college?
Don't you care about your future?
You are not old enough to prioritise between homework and some tramp!
Your mother's right.
I waited until I was eleven before I kissed my How old are you?
Never mind.
What I'm saying is, it was a different time back then.
There was a war on.
I'll get it.
Maybe it's Malcolm's girlfriend come for some kissing..
Who is this girl?
Mom, don't make such a big deal outta this!
I knew this is exactly how you'd react!
This is none of your business!
It's nobody's business!
It's not a big deal, OK?
Well, it's not.
I would appreciate it if we could just drop it.
This is Ronnie Demarco.
As you can see, he's real.
Ow!
Hm!
Interesting!
We'll be in my room.
I can't believe how much stuff you have.
You wanna play cowboys?
No, I hate cowboys.
You can have 'em.
Really?
Thanks!
No take-backs.
Ronnie!
Ronnie, would you please empty the dishwasher for Mommy?
OK.
OK.
So, Dewey, come here.
Ronnie's birthday's coming up and I want to throw him a surprise party.
But he doesn't know that many people here.
I thought cos you're his first friend here, you could help me.
OK.
I want to invite your entire class.
All 30 kids?
Yeah.
Isn't that what you do for your birthday parties?
Huh?
What are we celebrating?
One, two, three, four, five.
Damn it!
You get back in here now!
I won't!
Sorta.
I was thinking Ronnie would like a Starwars theme for his party.
No, do cowboys!
What?
Cowboys.
He likes cowboys better than Starwars.
OK, that'll be fun.
Thank you, Dewey.
Oh, Brock!
What is it?
You're trembling, what's wrong?
Chad's getting suspicious.
You know he's been asking questions at the orphanage.
We need to get out of here!
Say goodbye to the money?
We just need to bide our time.
How can I trust you, Brock, when you haven't told Cassandra about us yet?
Have a heart, Vanessa!
The woman's still in a coma!
Coma?
Hey, honey!
I just got back from the Mayor's office.
He thinks he's gonna kill our little real estate deal.
What about the pictures of him and the Hastings girl?
They're on their way to the newspapers right now.
Perfect!
Now all we have to worry about is old man Landers.
Maybe we should send Largo to pay him a little visit.
What a mess!
Mr Hirkaby just called.
He said you got Cs in your last tests and you didn't turn in your history paper.
I warned you!
This has nothing to do with Sara!
I just forgot.
I'm doing it now, OK?
So, what kind of socks are you wearing?
Yeah, I like those.
Which shoes are you wearing?
Not the sneakers?
How about your boots?
Your sandals!
God, I totally love all your shoes!
Yeah, I guess I have homework to do, too.

You bought him that acne medicine.
I thought we were safe.
He's still goofy-looking.
His head is five times too big for his body.
We shouldn't have to worry about this with Malcolm.
He's gifted.
Girls shouldn't be interested until he's 28 and a billionaire!
Certain things are beyond the boy's control.
It's his genetics.
Girls, they just swoon.
Sorry, what am I telling your for?
You battle with it every day.
There's nothing we can do.
Oh, yes, there is!
I can ground him, and I can ground him till he graduates from Harvard.
He's gonna pull away, then we'll have another Francis on our hands.
Are you blaming Francis on me?
No!
That's what you said!
No, I meant that Lois, let's not have this veer off into us somehow not having sex tonight.
Oh, God!
Why do they do this to us?
Why can't they learn from their mistakes?
Even if they're just being stupid on purpose.
Seems like the only logical conclusion.
When they're grown we don't have to let them visit, do we?
Absolutely not.
It's just gonna be you and me, old and shrivelled in a big empty house.
The only sound a gentle sucking of the respirator.
And all our money will be sitting in the bank, helping no-one.
Mmmmm!
You guys seen Sara?
No.
That's weird.
She's two minutes late.
Were you supposed to meet her here?
No, not exactly.
But it was implied.
Implied?
We meet at the water fountain at eight.
We're always within 30 seconds of each other in the lunch line.
When I get home I wait four minutes before I call.
That's how it's been.
That's our thing.
Wow!
I didn't know having a girlfriend was so creepy!
It's not creepy!
This is totally normal!
This is dating!
You spend time with each other, get to know each other's habits.
When you're in a relationship you'll understand.
I'll just hang out outside the bathrooms.
Hi, Mrs Demarco.
Sorry to bother you, but the nanny put too much banana in my smoothie.
Oh, we'll fix that.
I just booked the cowboy!
He's gonna be passing out cowboy hats and making balloon animals.
Does he do trick shooting?
I'm sure we can find someone who does.
I bet Ronnie would like a moonbounce, too.
This relationship is finally starting to make sense.
For a while all we did is fight and make out, then fight, then make out.
But that's all behind us.
We were screaming at each other five minutes ago.
Now it just feels so right.
Wait, what are you doing?
Where are you going?
Home.
We've been kissing for two hours, my face is sore.
Yeah, she's right.
We can't make out all day.
We've both got our own things to do.
She's so smart.
If you're seeing someone else just tell me!
What?
!
I-I'm sorry.
I don't know where that came from.
Look, I've gotta go home.
I'll call you tonight.
That was pathetic!
You were watching us?
Believe me, it's the last time!
Just because you have a girl doesn't mean you should act like one.
I don't know what's wrong with her!
She's driving me crazy!
I freak out 20 times a day!
Dude, you think about everything too much.
Calm down.
Turn off your brain.
It's not that easy.
Sure it is.
I do it all the time.
Watch.
You can't just turn off your Reese!
Reese!
Whoa!
How long was I out?
And as I pulled her from the wreckage, she was so  ..
disfigured that I didn't even know it was my own sister.

Where were you last night?
What?
The Space 1999 marathon on the Sci Fi channel.
I made you a tunic and a hologram badge.
I-I'm - Forget it!
I gave it to my mom's boyfriend!
Thanks for nothing!
Guys, look, I'm sorry.
I've just been Sara and I were on the phone Never mind.
I'm just sorry.
I promise this won't happen again.
I think I turned a corner on this thing.
Sara and I were talking and it just came to me.
I think we worked things out.
Can you guys excuse me?
I'll be right back.
He does seem sorry.
I say we cancel our vote of censure.
I second that.
He was there for us after the arboretum broke down.
And how can you look in those eyes and say no to anything he asks?
I think he's learned his lesson.
OK, only two invitations left.
Ronnie's gonna have a moonbounce and a make-your-own-sundae car.
I'll go.
Maybe you will.
What kind of present would you bring?
Skateboard?
Excellent choice!
Ronnie has a brand new skate board.
Why don't you let ME worry about Ronnie?
Sit!
Look at yourself!
They've put you on probation.
Probation!
If you do just one more thing wrong they're gonna kick you outta school!
Do you have any idea how serious this is?
Is this who you wanna be?
You wanna be a lap dog who ruins his life for some girl?
For God's sake, Malcolm, you beat up a foreign exchange student!
He left his country to get away from this kind of abuse!
Are you listening to me?
Yes, I'm listening!
But I've got bigger problems!
You may not have noticed, but I've been screwing up a lot.
All because of some stupid girl!
I'm on probation!
I beat up a kid who doesn't even speak English!
I'm going through a lot and you don't even care!
We can still pull this off!
You'll never pass the DNE test, and even your lies won't be enough.
But Brock, if you didn't buy the mining rights, then who did?
Don't you see?
The person who bought the mining rights is the same person who stole Mrs Bronson's brooch.
And the person who ran Nathaniel's car off the road that night.
That person's name is - OK, you're free to go.
Ssh!
Come on, move it!
Just five more minutes!
Wait!
No!
It was the Mayor, right?
Or the widow Farthington?
What about the creepy janitor?
No, his amnesiac brother!
Argh!
I didn't understand one word that was said in the last six hours.
I'm exhausted.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I finally figured out what I gotta do.
Sara!
Wait up!
Look, I've done a lot of thinking and we need to talk.
Sara, this just isn't working.
Since I've known you I've been nothing but obsessive and neurotic.
A jealous creep who's way too clingy.
I don't like what this is turning me into, so I got you this pager.
What?
It's perfect.
Now we know where the other one is every second.
No more worry or doubt.
We'll be able to trust each other.
We have to break up, Malcolm.
I don't think you heard me.
I'm proposing the exact opposite.
That's what the pager's for.
I'm sorry.
Bye.
No!
No!
No!
Sara!
You can't break up with me!
Because I am filled with nothing but love and good feelings!
And no anger and no jealousy!
And none of those things that will lead you to not wanting to be with me!
OK, fine!
Get outta here!
I don't need you!
I hate your guts!
I never needed you!
No, no, no, no!
I love you!
I always have, I always will!
We were meant to be together!
I gave you my soul, Sara!
I gave it to you, my soul!
My soul!
Sara!
There you go, sweetheart.
I always thought you hated cookie dough.
So, are you having a good time?
Yeah, Mom.
Thanks.
You really should help Dewey.
He was a big help in planning this.
You ruined by birthday!
I hate you!
I've had two sundaes and four snow cones.
Malcolm, look.
Come on.
Come on.
I can't feel my fingers.
I'll go get us some punch, how's that sound?
You know, son, this is all part of growing up.
You're just gonna have to get used to it.
No, I don't.
I can go back.
I can go back!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna play.
You can't!
You're too big!
No, I'm not.
I'm going back.
No, you're too big!
You're going to ruin my party!
# Party day # Sleeping our cares away # On our way # to where the air is sweet #  OK!
Don't panic!
OK!
OK!
Hah!
Yeeeargh!
You're OK!
Don't be scared!
Oh!
Don't be afraid, son.
It was just a loud explosion.
Everything is going to be OK.
Don't be afraid.
Just once I'd like to learn without something exploding.
# That's how the West was won #
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Lois, are you about done?
No!
You gotta get outta there - I'm late.
NO!
You should get up in time!
I WOULD if someone didn't turn off my snooze alarm!
It went off every SIX minutes for an HOUR!
What are you doing?
Getting in, Lois!
You are NOT!
Not until I am finished!
I don't think I'll be able to come in today!
I've got a pretty severe fever, scratchy throat Cough.
# Yes, no, maybe # I don't know # Can you repeat the question?

No.
No.
Wait.
No.
No.
Gimme that!
No.
No.
No.
Wait.
No.
No.
Hi, boys.
Got a second?
You have a pretty good life!
Uh-oh.
Spend your days flying kites, playing video games.
It's time you enriched your lives.
When did we have kites?
!
I won't have you grow up to be selfish little pigs.
So I volunteered you to do some charity work.
You can choose between helping old people, or helping poor people.
Or I can make you do BOTH!
OK!
Old people.
Poor people!
We want poor people!
Hi.
I'm Francis.
Mr Price said I should see you.
Oh!
I can't believe how cold it is up here!
Course it is Alaska, but you'd think they could dome the place, or put tunnels between the buildings.
You must know my buddy Eric Hanson.
He got the logging job for me.
Do you give out the axes?
Cos I'm a lefty if that makes any difference?
What's that?
A broom, genius Grab an apron, sweep out my pantry.
And quit starin' at my bosom!
You don't understand I came here to work as a logger.
Lemme tell ya about loggers - they're filthy, drunken, low-life swine, ..
and YOU are their slave.
You will feed them, do their laundry and clean out their privys.
Don't steal, don't back talk, and don't socialise with the Eskimos.
OK WHAT'D I SAY ABOUT BACK-TALK?
!
Eric?
Francis?
!
What's goin' on?
I thought you -  I don't hear sweepin'!
You boys should be so proud of yourselves!
People will really appreciate this.
I'm gonna say a special prayer for you.
Yeah.
That should make us even Why are we organising trash?
!
It's not trash!
It's stuff donated to the poor.
Look, Reese, it's just like yours.
Except nicer.
It doesn't have holes.
Well, this jacket is better than yours!
You're right.
Everything IN here is better than our stuff!
Haha!
You're poor!
No wonder I never got a rocket sled.
What are you doing?
Trading!
But- Look, I'm making a donation.
Instead of ONE poor person getting a new shirt, TWO poor people do.
What's wrong with that?
I can't move!
Ten hours scouring deep-fat friers with a 20 minute break to de-tick sled dogs What's wrong with that woman?
!
Her name's Lavernia.
She controls every facet of your life.
She finds out your weaknesses then gets inside your head and makes you hate yourself!
Women!
They're just like the woods.
Mysterious.
Full of wolves.
Whoah!
Pull together man!
It could be worse.
At least we're making good money.
No, we're not!
See her ledger book?
She charges us for EVERYTHING and deducts it from our pay!
Food, rent, aprons, Hair gel.
My first cheque was for $6!
Great Generator's out again.
So, what, we just sit around in the dark?
!
Oh, this isn't dark.
Ever spent the night in a caribou's gut?
Who is this old coot?
He's my best friend here!
So nice of your boys to help us out like this!
We've always LOVED this old church.
If you cut through the parking lot you miss the traffic light on Sixth.
Keep up the good work, boys!
Alright, I'll be back in two hours.
During which time I suggest you think about the horrible thoughtless whatever it is you did to deserve this punishment.
That's just it!
We didn't DO anything.
Mom said we needed to build character.
YOUR character, right?
Well, see that you do!
What are you doing?
Trading again.
A backpack for a backpack.
Dewey, wait!
A yo-yo isn't equal to a GameBoy.
What if I throw in my Mightyman.
OK, two toys for one seems fair.
Yeah.
I mean, as long as what we trade is equal, it seems Whoa Check these out!
Is this fair?
Think of it this way When you add the value of the work we're doing, we're still way ahead.
Where do I dump this?
Ya don't dump it!
You take the bucket, heat it to 190 degrees, run it through the hair trap and make gravy for dinner.
Re-use old filthy fat?
!
DO YOU LIKE HAVIN' A JOB?
!
Hey, Lavernia.
I need some licorice, some paper towels and a 6-pack of beer.
Sure, hon.
Oh, no.
It took me six months to get you paid off last time.
I'm outta your book for good.
Hard cash!
Got it exactly!
Good enough.
Like a freshly baked muffin.
Only $8.
You gotta be kiddin'!
Eight bucks for a lil Are those raisins?
Last ones till spring.
Quit starin' at my caboose - back to work!
Hey, you don't have to snarl at us everyti- High school's brutal!
Don't get this much homework in other classes.
They just keep heaping it on!
Is Monday OK?
Make it Friday.
I don't wanna ruin your weekend.
Oh.
I lost the crystal off my watch.
Your parents gave you that.
There's one like this at the church.
Could you get it for me?
If you donate something of equal or greater value.
How about aftershave?
Mom got it for me for parties and dances.
Poor deluded woman!
Sold.
You wouldn't believe the stuff they got.
Clothes, toys, comics Yesterday a guy donated an old Nintendo - the Double Dragon 4 game.
DD4?
!
The Sacred Stone?
Yeah, why?
I give you $20 for it.
Money?
I guess we could put it in the collection box.
This is great!
The church is only charging $5 for it.
This way Stevie gets his game and the church gets an extra $10.
No, the church gets an extra $15.
I think we deserve something for our trouble.
Think of it this way The church gets three times what it asked for.
Yeah.
We're makin' this work for everyone.
Any porcelain tea sets?
NOT for me, of course.
For my sister.
Isn't she at Vassar?
Look, do you want the cash or not?
!
"..
and my job in Alaska is great - making tons of money and friends".
"So your dire predictions of misery and exploitation were, as always, dead wrong".
Oh, he's a good boy.
They're all good kids.
Mrs Potts at the church says they're a godsend.
Whoah, whoah!
Where are you off to?
We told Mrs Potts we'd be back after lunch.
Charity's fun.
Thanks, Mom!
Well, whaddaya know!
Are we finally getting something right with them?
..
..
with your children.
# HEROIC FILM SCORE And experience the just-washed freshness of new Persil.
..
This is ridiculous!
The wolves had me tree-ed for half an hour.
I've just about- OW!
YOU CAN'T TREAT US LIKE THIS!
This is inhuman!
We are citizens!
This is America!
Isn't it?
I'm sorry, Francis.
It's all my fault.
Stop crying.
It's OK, man.
No, it isn't!
God, you must hate me.
Come on!
You're my friend.
I can't hate YOU!
Er, sorry.
Thought I's pickin' up the vibe.
Look, Lavernia may be evil, and she may be tough, but we can beat her.
How?
Our lives our controlled by that ledger book.
Everything we do increases our debt.
This is what military school was for To wage war against all authority no matter what the odds.
She may be a manipulative monster, but Mom can't win every round.
Who?
Lavernia!
We gotta get her where she lives.
We gotta get that book!
I HATE that book.
Know what book I hate?
Valley of the Dolls.
What kind of ending was that?
OK, Stevie wants Pam Grier memorabilia.
IF he can keep it here.
If he's got the money, the church doesn't care.
And the liquor store guy will take the breadmaker.
Hey, we're up to $159!
What shall we buy?
I say we buy a saddle.
Then they can't say no to the horse.
I don't WANT a horse!
I say we vote.
Dewey?
Can God see everything we do?
What?
Mrs Potts said God sees everything we do.
Yeah, Dewey.
God can magically see through roofs.
What are you worried about?
We're not doing anything wrong.
Then how come we have money?
Well, sometimes when you do good things, good things happen for you.
Satisfied?
I mean, think of it this way, Dewey, people are still getting what they need.
OK, we DO have some money, but the church does, too, so no-one's getting hurt an-  This is bad.
Once we get the saddle, we should just quit.
We're not getting the saddle!
This was ALL a mistake!
I should've KNOWN something was wrong when YOU started making sense.
This is YOUR fault!
You're supposed to keep us OUT of trouble!
So YOU'RE going to hell!
We're ALL going to hell!
You guys seen the remote for What's going on?
Dad, we've done something terrible.
It might be the worst thing we've ever done.
Just calm down.
Let's talk this through.
It can't be that bad.
You've been stealing money from the CHURCH!
And maybe some merchandise.
You boys, you've been taking stereos, toys Is that cheese?
Oh god ARGH!
My god!
Dewey, get a washcloth!
Here you go, Dad.
Nice and even.
You stole AIR?
!
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU BOYS?
Do you EVER stop and think of the consequences of ANYTHING you do?
!
Do you realise the SHAME you'll bring on the family?
DO YOU?
!
Forget THAT, what's MOM gonna say?
!
Right, we sneak this back into the church, and no-one will ever know.
The church left us alone with all that stuff.
It was entrapment!
Reese, no more excuses!
Oh, damn!
IT'S GOD, HE FOUND US!
It's not God, Dewey.
It's just my crappy car.
Although he COULD have helped out in my career a bit, thrown a promotion MY WAY once in a while.
Maybe it IS God!
This is the street mum drives down, and she finishes work in TEN MINUTES!
You, sir, a shirt?
Three shirts.
Some pants?
You'd be a 34 waist?
Look, I don't want these!
Why not, they're free!
What's wrong with them?
Nothing!
Oh, look, just gimme five bucks!
Alright.
What's going on?
This guy's selling me all this for five bucks.
I'll give you five for that.
OK, gather round.
I've got a good-as-new stereo.
Who's next?
I am.
This your stuff?
I know how this must look, but I didn't steal any of these things.
My boys took 'em from a church.
Neither one of you nimrods leave until that grill is spotless.
And after that, get that jar of poison and bait the rat traps.
That doesn't make sense.
Why poison them if we have traps?
Because I'll fire your ass!
Perfect.
Nice job with the tape!
Thanks.
Most people put the tape on too tight so you lose that nice clang.
Everyone hates her so much, they'll never pin it on us!
God, look at this next to my name - emotionally dependent on pornography, loves nut clusters.
How does she know I love nut clusters?
!
Took the tape off the door.
You dragged me to Alaska.
Nnnrrrrrrgg!
Aarrrnnnnng!
Listen, if you do hear from them, please call me.
Yes!
Hal!
You had me worried sick!
The police said they released you three hours ago!
By now you'll know everything.
The boys and I are gonna disappear.
Hal, where are you?
I am not at liberty to reveal that.
"BUS NO.
23 FOR OMAHA NOW BOARDING".
Hal, you're a middle-aged man, you CAN'T run away from home!
I have a credit card that begs to differ!
Hang up!
She's tracin' it!
DON'T YOU HANG UP THAT PHONE!
Hal, you're not gonna do this.
You and the boys are gonna come home right now.
Why would I do that?
Because you love me too much to run away.
That may may be true, Lois.
But maybe we'll just have a long distance relationship for a while.
Some of those can work.
Hal, have you even thought what you'd be like without me?
Well, no..
Do you have any idea how much you'd miss me?
Do you?
Yes Yes.
I I have some idea.
Dad, you're folding!
He's folding!
I knew we should've paid that wino to make the call.
Er, honey?
We're back.
Hey, guys.
Why don't you wash up, dinner's ready.
It's your favourite - meat loaf and mashed potatoes.
OK.
Great.
Why isn't she mad?
What happened?
Our stuff is gone!
I gave it all to charity.
You've two changes of clothes - one for school, one for home.
Something wrong?
No problem.
No, fine.
No, no.
More wine?
Please.
So, how long is it gonna take us to work off all this stuff?
Well, this should put us into the 23rd century.
Sesame cracker?
Don't mind if I do.
I've been lying here thinking about God.
I don't know much, just that he's this all powerful, all knowing being.
Kinda like Mom, only invisible.
So I feel better on his good side.
And we probably all focus too much on material things.
What are you doing?
Praying.
No you're NOT!

This is my cage.
Are you serious?
Mom?
Dad?
This is Bernard, the hamster from my class.
It's my weekend to take care of him.
This isn't a good time.
I want you to see how good I am at taking care of him, and how good I'd be at taking care of a dog.
Did I mention that all the other kids have dogs?
Honey, your father and I need to talk.
I saw a nice one at the pet store and I could name him Jeff and - Go play in your room!
OK.
I'll put your cage right here, Bernard.
Sorry I said I wanted a dog in front of you.
Is your brain big enough to get your feelings hurt?
Me neither.
I'll take good care of you.
Bernard?
I thought you were getting a routine check-up.
That's when they find it.
Can't they do anything?
Not until they get the biopsy back.
There you are.
You can't call that a short cut!
It has to be shorter!
Says who?
!
Says the word!
It's just when you don't use regular streets.
If it took 150 years to cross the street, as long as you went through some bushes, that'd be a short cut?
!
You hate being wrong.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
What is wrong with you?
Look at that floor!
Oh, sorry.
How many times have I said don't track mud into this house?
We'll clean it up.
Not good enough!
You're grounded for a week!
What?
You can't do that!
Want it to be two weeks?
Dad!
You heard your mother.
This is ridiculous!
You're being unfair!
Just because Malcolm got mud on his shoes and tracked it in the house doesn't mean he should be grounded.
Go to your room now!
What's her problem?
They're so boring they invent stuff to be upset about.
Are you the biggest idiot to ever walk this Earth?
Good morning.
What did I tell you to do, jackass?
Paint the kitchen, which I'm doing.
What kind of a moron paints it white?
Wanna see all the dirt?
What'd they teach you in college?
I'm a high school dropout and I used the paint that you left for me.
I moved that paint so you could get to the green, idiot.
Do it over, even if you're here all night!
What?
That paint you wasted is coming out of your pay.
I should paint it the colour of your dye job.
What?
He didn't say anything.
I said maybe I should paint it the same colour as your dye job, you sagging, leathery, hatchet-faced, dried-up old hag.
Alright, college boy, you want it?
You got it!
I'm gonna kick your ass!
Excuse me?
I'm kickin' your ass.
Don't ever disrespect me like that.
You can't challenge her to a fight.
I didn't challenge anybody.
Hey, Lavernie's fightin' college boy!
We've got an opening Sunday at two before Mass.
Sunday.
Two o'clock.
Your ass, my foot.
There's no way I'm fighting a woman!
If I don't mind, why should you?
Oooooo!
See what she did?
She called him a woman.
It's gonna be a blood bath!
You're right, Dewey.
When was the last time we played ball?
I don't know.
Sometimes life gets away from you and you forget the things that are really important.
AAARGH!
!
Egh!
This is crazy.
I have enough on my mind without worrying about you!
But, Mom - Don't leave this room.
I don't want to see or hear you.
I don't want to sense your presence.
For crying out loud, Reese, there's a mirror right there!
Believe me, I am going to watch that door like a hawk.
What's her problem?
This can't be about mud.
Something's going on.
What've you done lately?
The Richardsons' fire, the windshield, the Sampsons' fire, the Jacksons' fire.
Nothing she knows about.
This sucks!
Well, if you can't do the time, don't do the crime.
See ya Monday.
Hey, moron, do you know what tomorrow night is?
Christine Matson's party!
That's this weekend?
Yeah, and her sister's bringing her friends.
They tongue kiss whether they like you or not!
It's shaking hands to them.
It's a cultural thing.
We have to go!
Reese, if I show you a way we can go, do you promise never to let anyone find out even though you're an idiot?
I swear.
OK.
I was saving this for a life or death emergency ..
or a really good party.
Tell me!
No way.
We're not hitting Mom with that!
Reese, tomorrow night, we take out the floorboard and sneak outside through the crawl space.
Wow.
Tunnelling out of our own room.
She can't lock us in any more.
Mom's powerless.
Yeah.
Now she's just a crazy old lady we live with.
Thanks, Dewey!
It's Dewey.
Let's hurt him, fellow idiot.
Yes.
I hate him for his handsomeness.
Aaaarrgh!
Hi, Dewey.
Hi, Lance.
Well, what do ya know?
It's Bernard.
Let me see him.
You can't have him.
That's alright.
I can wait.
Next week is my turn to have him.
We're gonna have a lot of fun.
You can't keep the hamster.
He belongs to the class.
He won't be safe.
You take good care of him, but you have to share him.
Lance isn't my friend.
He tore Billy's shirt off after school and -  Hello?
Yes!
This is he.
He killed a frog and brought it to school.
Dewey, I said no!
Do you want to be grounded like your brothers?
No.
I've never seen her this worked up for a fight.
She's done this before?
Since I've been here, she's fought five guys.
You're lucky you got some warning.
Know Big Don?
The guy with one ear?
Yeah.
He was going to the privvy and she dropped on him like a spider.
What's wrong with her?
We were having a stupid argument.
How did it turn into a fight?
It's how we settle things.
There are three other fights tomorrow.
Four.
Ned cut in front of Daryl.
Well, I hate to disappoint you but I'm not fighting Lavernia.
Really?
Are you sure?
No, he'll fight her.
No, I won't.
Thank you!
Fellas!
It looks like we're having a coward's cotillion.
'' I'll get the dogs ready.
I'll sharpen the pig-sticker.
What are you talking about?
Fighting's the only entertainment here.
You've seen our TV reception.
If someone cheats the boys out of a fight, there's a coward's cotillion.
What the hell is a coward's cotillion?
It's always different.
You never know what animal the blood will attract.
My choices are to fight a woman or the stupid cotillion thing?
Well, there's always the ..
Howdy Stranger.
.
.
How can they make us wait another 24 hours?
They're short-handed at the lab.
Don't they realise it's your life?
Don't worry.
This is for the best.
I'm setting you free.
You won't have to worry about anyone being mean any more.
Come on, Bernard.
Run.
Run like the wind.
You have to do this, Bernard.
It's for your own good.
I'll be OK.
Go on!
I don't want you any more.
I don't like you.
I never did!
Go on!
Go on, you dumb old hamster.
Bye, Bernard.
Booby trapped?
A broom handle tied to a string of tin cans.
A classic.
If Mom trusted us, I think she'd be pleasantly surprised.
Yeah.
We're basically good kids.
She's so unreasonable.
Are you almost ready?
Just a sec.
Will you come on?
If anyone asks, I'm in junior college.
<  Hi, boys.
You don't know how lucky you are.
Everything is new.
Everything is open to you.
Please, don't ever take that for granted.
Make every moment the best you possibly can.
God, I am so proud of all of you.
You kids are the best thing I've ever done.
You'll never know how much I love you.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Sleep well, my little angels.
Aaaaargh!
Aaaaaarrrgghhh!

'' Amazing!
I made out with a sophomore.
I'm so far ahead of schedule.
Did you see the TV fly off the roof into the pool?
That was me.
I hope we get grounded next weekend.
'' How dare you?
!
How dare you defy us like that?
!
We wouldn't have if you weren't so hard over a little mud on the floor!
You two are the most ungrateful, badly behaved, inconsiderate boys ever born!
How could you be so heartless?
What's heartless about going to a party with a bunch of slutty girls?
Be cool.
You were at a party?
!
While we were here worrying?
!
Can I have a napkin?
I cannot believe you two!
Alright.
That's it!
You're grounded for the rest of the school year!
You can't do that!
You're crazy!
You do not talk to your mother that way ever!
You'll show her the love and respect she deserves whether I'm here or not!
This family sucks!
You are ruining our lives!
I wish you were dead!
What was that all about?
She usually just says, "I'm taking you with me".
I want to tell you something.
We'll talk at two.
I'm gonna tell you this right now.
I hate your guts.
You're the most horrible person I've ever met.
You are mean, sadistic, twisted and spiteful.
And I owe you an apology.
What I said was a cheap shot about your looks and you don't deserve that.
No-one deserves that.
You're right.
Thank you.
What the hell are we doing this for anyway?
This won't solve anything.
We're just putting on a show for idiots.
If you think you have to prove something because you're a woman, you don't.
You came and built a successful business in this awful place.
You have accomplished plenty.
Oh, my God!
You're coming on to me!
What?
Peddle your sugar to somebody else, cos this bee ain't buyin'.
What?
!
The last thing I need is some young punk frolicking in my nethers.
You don't listen t I try to talk to you Ew!
Do you hear anything?
Mom's still crying.
Did she ever go to sleep?
At 3 she went from sobbing to a quiet whimper.
She's just trying to psych us out!
I don't think so.
When was the last time you heard Dad yell and Mom cry?
You're right.
Something weird is going on.
They've been whispering a lot, too.
I just figured it out.
Oh, no.
Oh, no!
I've never seen her like this.
What do you expect?
The boy tried to jump in bed with her!
Dude, she's killing you!
Do something.
I will not hit a woman.
Then, here.
Take this.
What is it?
A screwdriver.
Jab and twist.
I'm not using the screwd Aaargh!
Fight.
Ugh!
Back.
Ugh!
Ease up on him.
His only crime was loving you.
Ugh!
You disgust me.
You better run home to Mama, so she can kiss your tears away and make you cocoa and tell you - Ugh!
Yeah!
Yeah!
My mother's a tormented control freak.
It would never occur to her to make me cocoa!
You're going down, college boy.
Bring it on, you toad.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Ned.
Daryl.
You're up.
Somebody help me clear this floor.
Alright.
I'll get the camera.
If anyone at school asks, your name's Bernard.
You like carrots and having your tummy scratched.
'No.
We've been waiting for hours.
Now please give us the information.
' Negative?
!
Negative!
That's a good one, right?
Yes, thank you.
If Mom does a load of blankets I'll bring you a friend.
Oh!
Mom.
Dad.
We have something to say.
We know why you've been crying.
You don't have to protect us.
We think getting a divorce is a great idea.
What?
You don't have to stay together.
We've known for years it was a sham.
Your relationship isn't working.
Mom needs a man who'll control her and Dad needs someone younger.
You both deserve some happiness.
I think we all do.
Amen to that.
We should go to a motel with Dad.
Our bags are packed.
Mom, you're still part of our lives.
We'll see you every other weekend.
Call us any time.
We've already discussed it.
I get full custody.

Reese has had the remote for four hours.
That's four hours of mindless crap in five second increments.
You go to the bathroom, you lose the remote!
Fine.
I can wait.
I dunno.
You drank a lot of soda.
It must really be pressing on your bladder.
Not gonna work.
THEN I had four glasses of Dad's iced tea.
He just kept POURING and POURING.
Not gonna work.
The equivalent of 3 semi-trailers of water pour over the falls every second.
Not gonna work.
Not gonna ..
work!
Turns out this is way better than anything on TV.
# Yes, no, maybe # I don't know # Can you repeat the question?
# You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # Life is unfair # Alright, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it NO!
Too far.
Go back!
Back, back, back, back, back, back.
THERE THERE THERE there!
Just three more inches clockwise and Wh-wh-wh-whoa, whoa!
easy Back a coupla degrees, steady..
YES!
Perfect!
Haha!
Oh.
These needles are going against the grain.
That'll be ALL I'll see!
Don't move!
Spend a couple of days with Grandma.
You can leave right after Christmas!
I am NOT visiting that woman!
She's EVIL and she HATES me!
Francis, it's Grandma's first Christmas since Grandpa died and you're closest.
How can you be so selfish?
Did you invite her there?
She's knows she's always welcome.
Maybe we'll come and surprise you.
Don't you threaten ME!
I am ending this discussion!
You are going to White Horse.
You are going to buy her a gift.
You will both have a proper Christmas!
I hate you!
Get this off of me, you stupid son of a- BOYS!
Dewey asked us to do it!
What is wrong with you?
!
The tree is barely in the door and already you're starting I can't leave you alone for a second without you trying to kill each other!
This is supposed to be a HAPPY TIME!
I dunno what it is, but Mom freaks out every Christmas.
Ho ho ho!
Who did this?
!
Who did this?
!
Drop and roll, honey!
Who did this?
!
For God's sakes, drop and roll!
Maybe it's the lack of sunlight.
That can mess with people's brains.
Hi, Grandma.
Oh, sh God sake's, it's colder in here.
Don't you turn the heat on?
I'm not paying those pirates.
Of course not.
Well, in the spirit of the season, let's begin this pathetic charade.
I never know what you're talking about.
You talk like a jackass.
You do this to torture me, hurt me?
!
You don't like Christmas music?
It sounds like a song they sang when they rode through villages throwing babies on the fire!
They sang Jingle Bells?
They sang something.
Well, look at that - 8pm already.
Way past bedtime.
Where do I sleep?
You're sittin' on it.
Does it turn into a bed?
Yes, it becomes a bed.
It's a special magic sofa It opens up for magic lazy boy The angels come and feed you grapes and sing to you while you sleep.
It flies around the room granting wishes for boys what are STUPID!
Alright, it doesn't fold out Can I look yet?
Just a minute.
Hey, this is from BOTH of us!
I picked it out.
I stepped in it!
HEY!
Hey  Gotcha!
Mom.
How nice to see you home.
I HAVE HAD IT!
What are you doing?
I am taking everything!
Every present, decoration and treat and locking it in the garage.
Every single Christmas, you burn or break or destroy, AND I AM PUTTING A STOP TO IT!
She's stealing Christmas!
You can't do this!
It's the last year Dewey will believe in Santa.
What?
!
If you boys behave until Christmas morning, there will BE a Christmas morning.
Otherwise, these go back to the store and Christmas will be cancelled!
You wouldn't cancel Christmas.
You're bluffing.
You cancelled Christmas?
!
No, I'm holding it hostage.
It seems harsh but nothing else has ever worked.
Every year we yell and threaten, bargain and beg Maybe this time they'll behave.
We're in this together.
I'm playing the unity card.
Bu- Unity card, Hal!
But I love Christmas!
I know you do, dear.
Is there anything that trumps the unity card?
Hal?
I really think we can win this 'Nam thing.
That's not for you.
That's for the carollers.
You ruin smoking for me.
You sound like you're dying.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
!
You can't wait to get my things.
Yeah I got big plans for these doilies And that 30-year-old can of peaches.
Don't touch my peaches!
Like I'm gonna   Stop that racket!
People are trying to sleep!
Your stupid music!
No figgy pudding for you!
Please pass the syrup, please.
Thank you.
You're very welcome.
More coffee?
Please.
I'll get it, Mom!
It's OK.
I hope you'll let us wash the dishes.
Love to.
Absolutely.
Now, THAT I'll take you up on.
We can do this.
It's Christmas Eve and we've behaved for 10 hours.
OK, eight were asleep, but we can do another 24, right?
Who wants the last waffle?
I do!
I do!
I do!
Oh, no!
You know, I would really like that waffle.
Yes, but I am a growing boy.
Perhaps it would be best if I had the waffle Thanks for offering it to me, boys.
They're such good boys.
.
Introducing new Dove Supreme Cream Oil Shower Velvet.
I tried it.
It was a really lovely sensation.
It made me feel like velvet was covering my skin.
Like a "me" moment.
Our richest cream with lush softening oil in new Dove Supreme Cream Oil Shower Luscious Velvet.
Go on, get your own little luxury.
.
AARGHH!
God, what the hell's wrong with you?
!
You like pushing me?
That's what happens when you push, tough guy!
Can't you do the entire family a favour and DIE!
All you've ever done is treat us like dirt.
You shouldn't be ALLOWED to be a Grandma!
Are you finished?
YES!
Yes, I AAARRGGGGHHHHH, GOD!
Oh, I am SO sorry!
I should've kissed your boo-boos and made dem better.
I was supposed to tell the bad little boy stories and bake you giant sugar cookies and knit you fluffy sweaters, carried you and held you, and told you how much I loved your diapers.
Why don't you just unhinge your jaw and finish me off?
After Magnum PI.
Lois!
I'm home!
Honey, look, I saw something and I just HAD to get it for you.
It's a little more than we agreed to spend on each other but - hey, it's Christmas!
- we got a whole year to follow rules!
It's beautiful..
!
I mean, isn't that what the season is all about?
Relaxing, enjoying things, making people happy.
Hal, that's so sweet and thoughtful.
I hope I get to open it.
Rats!
You're doin' it all wrong.
You've seven ornaments, I'm putting them on your tree - what's wrong?
Go get the angel off the - hic!
- mantel.
Who's this?
That is your grandfather when he was - hic!
- young man.
Euch!
Tell me that eyebrow isn't genetic You and him.
Both the same.
Always had to have your own way.
Nothing ever good enough.
Always had to fight everything.
Victor always had to be SO independent.
Left home when he was 11, lived on his own, go to work on farm, ploughin' the fields.
Like a man.
Worked 18 hours a day.
Had to sleep with the pigs.
But he never complained.
He was strong.
He made something of himself.
Nobody like that anymore.
Everybody's too soft.
Hey, Grandma, why don't you let me help you with that?
Your grandfather was tough!
He didn't take anything from anybody.
He was proud.
A man of honour.
He was a wonderful, ..
wonderful man.
Grandma?
Grandma?
Oh!
Oh, God!
Just one more night.
We can get through one night!
We should be proud.
Everything's put away.
And not a single fight.
We did it!
We're going to get presents?
We're gonna get presents.
What do we do now?
We could take a nap?
Or play quietly.
VERY quietly.
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
Oh, God I will be so glad when Christmas is over!
Then we'll be safe for another year.
Mom's doing this NEXT Christmas?
!
Why not?
It worked, didn't it?
And maybe not just Christmas!
What?
She could do it for Halloween or Fourth of July or birthdays?
!
She can't do this!
I can't take any more!
We have to stop her!
Something drastic.
I'm in.
Mom needs to know she can't take occasions hostage.
That we DON'T negotiate!
She turned a BEAUTIFUL family holiday into a nightmare.
We'll show her the TRUE spirit of Christmas.
First, you mustn't think of this as Christmas cider.
It's a non-denominational winter cider.
The boys are doing so well  Lois?
I'm a terrible mother!
I shouldn't be allowed to have children.
Sweetie I've ruined Christmas!
Whaddaya mean?
The boys are behaving like I never knew they could!
I thought that's what you wanted.
But not like this!
I wanted to take it back five minutes after I took the presents but I didn't know how!
I'M A MONSTER!
No, you're not a monster!
I am.
I really am.
No, you're not a monster.
WHY WON'T YOU ADMIT I'M A MONSTER?
!
Alright, in this particular case, you're a monster.
I know!
Let the machine get it.
Come on!
You know when you cry it makes me cry.
You are a WONDERFUL mother.
And you're a wonderful person.
"Hey, Mom.
Francis.
I am DISGUSTED with how you treat Grandma"!
"Abandoning a helpless old woman at Christmas?
I hope you're ASHAMED"!
I am I am.
Hal, the boys don't deserve this.
They're a little high-spirited, but they're GOOD, GOOD boys!
God, this feels so right!
This is WAY better than real Christmas!
Remember, mess 'em up just enough so Mom can't return them.
Wait a minute Mom got me the exact video game I asked for.
These are better than what I asked for.
You know what?
Mom got me everything I wanted.
Me, too.
She listened to us.
OK, so she got lucky a few times.
I never asked for a stupid globe!
That's mine.
The cleats are yours.
Oh.
Mom really tried this year.
All she wanted was a nice Christmas.
And we ruined it.
In all fairness, we ruin everything.
Remember, how happy we were a minute ago.
Can we go back?
I dunno.
Do we have any paint left?
No.
Oh, well What are you doing?
Doin' you a favour, so why not shut up and enjoy it.
What is this?
Oh, you don't wanna look in there, it's too sad.
Grandma, what are all these things?
There must be a thousand dollars worth of stuff in here.
$2,735.
$4500 Canadian.
Why are they in your closet?
They're gifts.
For the family, for relatives, for friends But you never give Oh, my God!
Donatello with pizza-throwing action?
!
I wanted one of these when I was six!
I know.
I bought it for you.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
And then, right before Christmas, your mommy put you on the phone you call me "Poopy" and hung up.
Is that the breadmaker Mom wanted last year?
If she wants bread so much she should write back when her mother writes to her.
This was for cousin Nicola.
I spent a day shopping for it.
Then she marries a Protestant.
That camera?
For your father.
Then he refused to drive me to the liquor store.
All the nice things I do for people.
Oh, my god, you're crazy!
I just thought you were evil, but you are nuts!
What are you talking about?
Grandma, gifts aren't conditional.
You give them to people because you love them!
They're not something you can take away because of some petty slight!
You're not teaching people anything They don't KNOW they've upset you!
You've just constructed a monument to your insanity!
WHAT SORT OF PERSON DOES THAT?
A lonely, ..
bitter, old woman.
What?
Look what I've done.
What use is all this to me now?
They could have brought someone some happiness.
Instead they rot here.
Oh Grandma?
My hea heart.
I think it's melting.
Yes It's melting.
Oh You showed me the way, Francis, by yelling at me.
Go get my magic sled and me and my reindeers will go and give Christmas to all the mean, stupid, rude people!
We'll all join hands and sing songs and we'll sprinkle the ingrates with fairy dust!
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Yes!
I mean, taking presents away from children?
!
What sort of sick person does that?
!
Let's get everything out of the garage and set it up inside and have a nice Christmas!
You know what?
Let's wake up the boys and have Christmas tonight!
Imagine their little faces!
Well, Hal, that was ..
smart of you to wake up the boys ..
so they could help us carry in the presents.
Yes, yes C-come on hurry up, boys.
Yeah Sure OK  I'll cut off his hands and stick them in his kakushnik!
You're a klebleck!
Oh, roller skates!
I hope you like 'em, sweetie!
I think we have another present here for Reese!
I wonder what it is?
!
This really is the best Christmas we've ever had!
I dunno why we didn't try this whole denial thing a long time ago.

Oh, with the boys asleep this house is so quiet!
Mm-hm.
Such a nice idea to build a fire.
Yeah.
Hey, I didn't build a fire.
I thought you built a fire.
Well, looks like Reese got a D in English.
And Dewey seems to be fighting again.
Biting.
Malcolm, tell your teacher I'd love to chaperone the class overnight!
We can share a tent!
# Yes, no, maybe # I don't know # Can you repeat the question?
# You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # Life is unfair # I can't believe you're allowed to do a video project instead of a paper!
You could have asked!
My parents aren't rich enough to buy a camera.
Rich and compensating.
I don't know what to write about.
What's your movie gonna be about?
The creative process.
You writing ..
your paper.
Is that on?
!
Turn it off!
You'll make me look like an idiot.
I'm serious!
This is ..
great!
Now knock me over!
Hal.
Hey, it's Abe!
Hi!
I know it's short notice, but someone dropped out of our poker game.
Can you make it tonight?
I've been waiting for this for months!
See you at eight.
Thanks!
Wah!
Yah!
Honey, guess what, guess what!
I'm gonna play poker at Abe's tonight!
Tonight's our first dance class!
That's tonight?
Yes!
It was your birthday present to me.
Oh!
Fine, go play poker.
I LOVE YOU!
Mwah!
Great Who am I gonna go with?
Did Reese finish his homework yet?
Of course!
Good!
Come to dance class with me.
What?
I was lying.
I didn't finish my homework.
I don't know what my homework is!
Go get your shoes.
If the weather report's right this storm will last a week.
Now, you ration these supplies.
Make no mistake, you're the last ones we'll dig out.
We're supposed to live for a week on meat paste and caribou jerky?
!
That's a week I don't get any work out of you!
No-one's cryin' for me!
It's just a friendly game.
We sit around talking and eventually get around to cards.
Good.
I want to meet your friends.
Everybody, this is Hal.
Hal.
Hi, Hal.
Hal, this is Brian, Trey, Steve and Malik.
It's great to meet you.
So, what's the buy-in?
$50.
There.
So, what's with Wanda?
Ain't no thang!
Whoa!
Put a dollar in the pot.
Oh, we got a regular D-dog here!
Right, left, cha-cha cha!
God made artificial hips for a reason!
Use them!
And back.
Cha-cha, finish.
Very good.
Everyone, let's pair up.
May I?
Oh, OK.
No way!
You be a gentleman!
It's just like touching a corpse It's just like touching a corpse How many lessons have you had?
What?
None!
Really?
I'm impressed!
You have very good instincts.
I do?
Mm-hm.
You're built for it.
You have a dancer's ankles.
I do not!
You're a lovely young man.
You don't shake like all the other men here!
Mind if I cut in?
You wait your turn!
I'll give you five bucks to dance with me.
OK!
And still he has ..
nothing!
Alright!
That's it!
I'm writing about you doing a movie.
But my movie's about your paper.
Yeah.
I'm doing my paper about your movie about me doing my paper!
Fine My movie's ..
about you doing ..
your paper ..
about me doing ..
my Alright, I get it!
..
movie ..
about you Hey, guys!
You should do your movie about old people.
They've saved money for years, and outlived everyone they wanted to share it with.
Talk about sad!
Raise you five.
I'll see your five and raise you ..
two.
Call.
Full house!
Kings over eights.
Straight flush to the jack.
I knew you had it!
But he had nothing on top!
He never stays in unless he's got something.
Well, perhaps we should call it a night.
We're definitely bringin' you back!
When was the last time you won?
He can't remember that far back!
Now you got something to sneak INTO your wife's purse!
I had the most wonderful time at dance class!
Every time the instructor showed us something, he used me as his partner.
I always thought I was such a clodhopper!
I cannot believe what I have missed all these years.
How was your game?
Hm?
Oh, it was great!
Why wouldn't it be?
I love Abe!
I love poker!
A whole night playing poker with Abe ..
and his friends.
I have a dancer's ankles!
What do you think, huh?
Wanna dance with the star pupil?
Huh?
You know, dance.
No, I'm not in the mood.
You're always in the mood!
Not every single night!
Yes, you are!
I'm not some kind of machine!
You can't just snap your fingers - Yes, I can.
I always have.
Oh, alright!
Pumpkin oil, pectin, manganese sulphate and ..
zinc oxide?
Yes!
That's meat paste, baby!
This sucks!
We knew we were gonna be stuck here for a week and no-one brought a deck of cards?
I could do my foot-puppets again.
Please, no!
How long have we been stuck here for?
I have lost all sense of time.
I'd guess about five days.
We just gotta keep ourselves busy.
Let's put our heads together and recreate episodes of Gilligan's Island!
We already did that.
That was this storm?
!
If we don't come up with something to do, I will go insane!
Come on, Reese!
We're gonna be late!
We're doing the mambo tonight.
I'll be home about 10:30.
Eeargh!
Arrgh!
What are you doing?
Is it too much to ask for pickles that are edible?
!
Hal, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Just go to your class.
Look, you have been snapping at everybody all week.
My class can wait one minute.
Now, you tell me what's going on.
OK.
This thing happened.
I didn't wanna talk about it because I'm not sure it happened and if it didn't I'd be a jerk for saying it did when it didn't.
I'd be creating this BIG issue, but it did happen.
Ohhh, it did!
I've recently come into a little money so I went to the mall to buy myself a CD player, then I saw a kid who looked like you and I thought of something better.
Here.
Wow!
The look on your face!
It was totally worth it!
You're the worst brother ever!
I know!
I know!
Oh, we like to think the differences people have aren't differences, but then I'm taken advantage of because I'm different!
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
We can talk later.
Bye!
"Hello"?
Abe, it's Hal.
"Please leave a message after the beep".
Abe, it's Hal.
I don't know if this is recording, but we need to talk.
I could be mistaken, and if I am, it's gonna make me sound like - "" I'm an idiot.
Dad!
Stevie's being really annoying!
He's filming everything I do!
Malcolm's Dammit, Stevie, I don't wanna hear it!
You behave!
You are a guest in this house!
He was a guest in your house!
People should never yell at children!
Especially children that aren't their own!
I apologised two minutes later!
And Stevie accepted the apology!
You know, he's not that fragile.
Relax!
Really.
What?
At least I'm man enough to apologise when I've been a jerk!
What is that supposed to mean?
!
You know what I'm talking about.
The way you and your friends treated me!
What?
!
Oh, please!
Obviously I'm different!
I stuck out like a sore thumb.
I thought it didn't matter but If you're implying what I think you're implying.
You want me to just say it?
I think you better.
Fine!
You and your poker buddies all ganged up on me because I'm not a professional!
Excuse me?
!
You and your doctor and lawyer and dentist friend!
You decided it was OK to skin a guy just because he's a working stiff!
And I bet you had a big laugh about it!
We didn't gang up on you!
You just stink at poker!
That was a cheap shot.
The truth hurts.
If we played a straight game, I'd mop the floor with you.
We did play in a straight game.
And you went home crying to your momma!
Let's play right now and we'll see who will do the crying and who will do the mopping.
I will own you!
I-I mean I didn't mean I meant - Oh, shut up and get the cards.
.
My home is full of messy little rascals.
Thank goodness my Air Wick Fresh Matic keeps the place fresh automatically.
It releases bursts of fragrance every 9, 18 or 36 minutes, so it always smells great.
Ahh!
Whatever my lot get up to.
Ahh!
Now there's a new discreet Fresh Matic Mini.
It goes anywhere in the house and automatically keeps it smelling lovely.
.
Gonna see me?
I'll see your five, and raise you five.
Fold.
Hah-ha!
Bet's ten.
I call.
Straight.
Flush.
Time's up.
My turn with the string.
I gave it to Pete.
I gave it to Francis.
And then I gave it back to Eric.
What?
!
You did not!
Yes, I did!
What are you trying to pull?
I'm just sayin', I don't have the string.
You're the last person I saw it with.
What are we gonna do without it?
!
It's just a stupid string!
So, what would be a reason for saying that, Eric?
You seem to have a motive against the string.
No, I love the string!
It's - Maybe you loved it a little too much.
And I quote, "If I can't have the string, no-one will".
I didn't say that!
Someone said it!
You!
Just now!
Don't try to twist this around.
He's not the one on trial.
What trial?
!
Guilty!
Guilty!
Guilty!
He raises four.
Your four, five more.
Maybe you should - You wanna play?
Fine.
I almost feel sorry for them.
Almost.
We're gonna end this right here.
Winner take all.
Fine.
Turn 'em up.
Three fives!
Three fives with a jack.
Yeah!
That makes six fives.
What the hell kind of deck has six fives?
!
I got them from the boys' room.
You don't even have a decent deck!
I'm sorry I don't have solid gold cards like you're accustomed to!
This poor-guy act is getting tiring.
Your superior act is old!
If I'm such a jerk, why'd you come over?
!
Pardon me for wanting to play poker with my best friend!
I mean, I-I was really excited to come over and play poker and .
.meet your other friends.
Truth be told, I was excited for you to come over, too.
I bought a new shirt.
That Hawaiian one?
I like that one.
Why are we fighting like this?
Because we're idiots!
Boys, what do you say we go out for ice cream?
Sounds good to me.
Dewey, come on, we're going for ice cream!
Where's your brother?
See this, ladies?
Mrs Angelo gets her dance.
As for the rest of you - I am not running a charity.
You have to come up with the dough.
I do not dance on credit.
No offence, but some of you might not even be around next week.
Oh, I didn't want that to end!
That does it - I am signing up for your Monday, Wednesday class.
Maybe Saturday, too!
Lois, Lois, please.
Come with me.
Um, ..
we have to stop this.
Why?
Honey, you've outgrown me.
I give beginning dance lessons, usually to people who can barely move.
This is another instructor.
He's across town.
He is the best.
He's the only one who can take you to the next level.
But I really love it here.
Lois, you have a gift.
You mustn't waste it.
It's time for you to - to spread your wings.
Fly.
Fly away, little bird.
Oh, my God!
Francis!
You're going to do it?
!
I'm your best friend.
I'm not gonna let these jerks brand you.
Everyone's gonna know you're a string thief!
Aaaaaargh!
We're shovelled out.
Vacation's over.
He took the string.
Every damn storm!
So, Dewey, how come you're not playing with your toy?
What are you smiling about?
"" Where did you get this?
!
"# ..
cheek to cheek #" "# Is heaven #" Have a seat.
In a minute you and Mrs Johnson do the forbidden dance.
You think that's the only copy?
What do you take me for?
Enjoy your assembly tomorrow.
I'm going to the ball game with Abe.
He had one ticket.
Invited me.
That's great, dear.
I'm glad What's this?
"" He was trying to get rid of me!
Hal, turn this off.
Hal!
Oh, my God, I can't believe how beautiful you dance!
Hal, you are such a fool.

"Hello, Hal".

I don't want you to be late on your first day.
And no excuses!
I don't wanna hear, "A lion escaped from the zoo", or, "The bus driver went insane and refused to stop".
Francis's friend gave Reese a job at the Circus Burger.
It's perfect.
Reese gets to be bossed around all day by the only guy on the planet that's dumber than he is.
This job is stupid!
You do get to wear a paper hat.
You wanna drive, you have to pay your own insurance!
Everyone else is insured!
Why me?
They've got it covered.
Son, it's not as simple as that.
You see Good morning, everybody!
Say good morning, Charlie.
Show everyone how alive you are.
My parents made a deal with Dewey.
If he keeps his goldfish alive for two months, he gets a dog.
Am I doing a good job?
You sure are.
Last week there was banana in it!
I do not want a dog!
If the fish lives, there's nothing we can do!
Hal, I expect you to take care of this.
What are you suggesting?
I'm not suggesting anything.
I just want it taken care of.
Class, today we begin a new round of independent study projects.
Hydrostatic equilibrium?
My God, I'm still on integral quantisation.
My stepdad's right.
I'm useless!
The cold, hard fact of life is some are more advanced than others.
Some even think they're more advanced than me.
I never said that.
Yet you assume I'm talking about you.
You're looking right at me!
You're convinced, by virtue of you being in this class, your intellects tower above the plebeians wasting oxygen in the rest of the school.
But, to some, you are nothing more than howling primates.
I'm excited to announce we're welcoming to our class a new student.
A young man of unparalleled intellect.
As near as we can measure, his IQ is over 280.
Those tests are culturally biased!
Think what you will.
Your petty fears no longer concern me.
I finally have the mental clay worthy of my sculpting.
Barton is a white-hot comet of brilliance, blazing through our dark corner of ignorance.
A mind of unfathomable reach and enormous power.
Can I come in now?
I told you to wait till you heard, "A new era for man".
But there's a bee out there.
So, assistant manager.
How?
INS raid cleaned us out.
So, from 12 to 5, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, this is my domain.
I'm proof you don't need to graduate high school.
That's just propaganda from those money-grabbing diploma companies.
Sean, Doug, this is Reese.
Hey.
Hey.
OK.
Press cow for burger, potato for fries.
I'm not sure what this is.
Does that look like a pig or a dog to you?
Wouldn't it be easier to put words on the keys?
Ah, a man of letters.
A word to the wise.
I wouldn't throw that in anyone's face.
Once you get your total put the money in the drawer, except pocket transactions.
What's that?
A morale builder.
Once in a while take 5 or 10 bucks.
Don't ring it up, put it in your pocket.
You don't have a problem with that, do you?
Oh, no.
That's cool.
You've entered the working world.
A world of adult responsibility.
I have her locker key.
If you wanna smell her jacket later, let me know.
They found the last piece of that guy.
Oh, man!
If we're sharing toilet paper, can we keep it on the spindle?
If we're bringing this kinda stuff up, my fiancee's coming Thursday.
Fiancee?
What are you taking about?
I'm engaged.
I'm tired of playing the field.
You don't know any women.
That occurred to me, too, so I ordered one from Russia.
A mail-order bride?
That exists?
In the more irradiated parts of Russia there are lots of marriage-minded women.
That's my darling Svetlana.
Wait a second.
Yep.
Svetlana.
How come you're driving us to school?
That's what moms do sometimes.
Argh!
OK, you know your Tolstoy and your Eliot Let's see how you do with the Bard.
"Every true man's apparel fits your thief".
Measure For Measure, Act 4, Scene 2.
Could you hand me my green crayon?
Wow, he's right again.
OK, let's try Chaucer's The Shipman's Tale.
Should I start with the prologue?
Please.
How about line 203?
"When your husband has gone off to Flanders, I shall deliver you from fear of slanders, and on the word he caught her by the flanks and clasped her closely, giving her a riot of kisses, saying softly, 'Keep things quiet'" What are you doing?
Chaucer?
I cannot believe you're polluting his mind with such pop culture drivel!
I apologise for them, Barton.
I'll do everything I can to minimise these annoying distractions so you can concentrate on the accelerated programme I've laid out for you.
Together we are gonna astonish the world.
Would you like a pixie stick?
Thank you.
Having problems, Malcolm?
No, no, not you This stupid hydrostatic equilibrium doesn't make sense!
It is hard.
But don't despair.
I'm here for you.
I'll make sure you get the help you deserve.
To estimate the pressure at the sun's centre, assume a constant density of 1.41 grams per cubic cm.
Too fast?
Herkabe made you my tutor to humiliate me.
I thought it was to humiliate me.
Why is this so hard?
!
Don't give up.
Remember The Little Engine That Could?
You're not listening!
I get everything!
There is nothing I haven't been able to master.
I took algebra in 6th grade!
I rebuilt dad's transmission when I was five!
I read before I could walk!
I remember my own birth.
What?
!
D'you know your heart stops during your mother's contractions?
You seriously remember that?
Worst was the diaper changing.
That was the most degrading week of my life.
So, what's it like in there?
Whaddya mean?
Well, your brain?
For me it's like, when I'm thinking really hard, my brain starts making all these connections.
Those connections make other connections, then it feels like a bomb's going off.
Is yours like that?
More like a beehive.
And every bee has a brain like yours.
OK, ready!
That is so cool!
I wish you had a gun so we can really test this out.
Excuse me.
Can I get some help here?
Hi, Greg.
I overheard your mom talking and it's true.
You've got a job.
I applied here once.
Didn't get it.
It's all politics.
I guess.
Whaddya want?
You to listen carefully.
My blood sugar's low so I don't wanna burn up calories repeating myself.
I want the jumbo clown burger with fries, no pickles, a slice of onion, centre cut, and extra tomatoes.
Do the patie well on one side, medium on the other.
Make sure they open a fresh package for my bun.
If it's stale I bale.
Seriously.
That comes to $5.45 and you get free refills on the soda.
Heard that one before.
Turns out it's just for today.
What a sack!
That's a pocket transaction if I ever saw one.
Oh, yeah.
Right.

Artie, you throw one helluva bachelor party.
I'm just sorry the nearest stripper's 300 miles away.
Hey, how's she doin' anyway?
She took her top off!
Listen up!
I'd like to say a few words about my mate Pete, on account of his upcoming nuptials.
Many's the time, when I've been feeling low, I always knew I could turn to Pete.
He'd be lying on his bunk, trimming his beard with a lighter, and I'd think, "Hell, I'm better than that".
To Pete and his lucky lady!
What's with you?
What are we celebrating?
It seems wrong.
If he wants to marry a stranger, that's his business.
Is anyone thinking about this woman?
I'm trying to keep a stripper in my head.
Think about it.
She's gonna spend her life here with Pete as her husband.
What poor creature would go through with this?
Maybe her life's pretty awful.
Worse than this?
Does she live in a slaughterhouse?
Get dragged to work by horses?
She's no idea what she's getting into.
You're exaggerating.
It might work out fine.
How's business?
Where were you?
I was meant to be home for dinner but only you can cash me out.
Stay on my good side.
One day somebody'll have to clean the bathrooms.
Whoa, this is uncool.
You can't take this much money.
Whaddya mean?
Your till is over $400 short.
Look.
The point is to take five or ten bucks.
That's it.
Put the 400 back.
I didn't take it.
Honest.
It's your register.
Did he give his register key to anyone?
No.
I didn't take any.
I never even did a pocket transaction.
I saw you yesterday.
I wanted it to look like that.
When you weren't looking I put it back.
You didn't see it cos I was being sneaky.
Nice.
Way to screw it up for us.
I didn't take it!
I'm not coverin' for you.
When the owner checks the books tomorrow, that money better be here or you're going down.
The change from apparent to absolute magnitude.
The formula is ..
A over B times K over D. That's if K is How do they expect you to learn formulas?
Use a mnemonic device, like Enephru, Babashar, Kalar, Dastrer.
Abalonian kings, Third Dynasty.
Stop complaining.
I have homework, too.
Ah, it's a butterfly.
You gotta help me.
What's goin' on?
It's horrible.
$400 is missing from my register and they think I took it.
Well, did you?
No, of course not!
I'm Barton.
Who's this dork?
My tutor.
You're kiddin'!
When I need you to be a genius I find you've been faking it.
Calm down.
How did this happen?
I dunno.
My register didn't total.
Who was there?
Everyone.
Me, Sean, Greta, Richie.
Richie?
Why didn't you say so?
Whaddya mean?
He's setting you up.
How do you know?
Because it's Richie!
C'mon!
Wanna learn about the real world?
Not really.
Too bad.
You're coming.
Dewey, cover for us.
Make sure it sounds like we're all still here.
Got it.
Ow!
Stop it!
You shut up!
Stupid creeps!
Ow!
Yes, I got it.
Pet store owner said it was already dead, but I suspect the worst.
Switch them tonight when Dewey's sleeping.
It seems so sneaky and underhanded.
What kind of example are we setting for the boys?
Stop worrying.
The boys are fine.
Did you get the money?
Yeah, you'd like another 400, wouldn't you?
What are you talking about?
Wow!
An entire colony of parasitica.
Get your own pizza, Dewey.
His name's not Dewey.
How come you had me call him that all these years?
We know you took the money and you're pinning it on Reese.
After everything my brother's done for you!
All the alibis, handouts, all the times he's helped you fake your death!
Whoa!
I wasn't there today.
I only came in to cash out.
You were there.
I had a break at 4:30.
You coulda snuck in then and taken it.
Yeah You wanna play innocent?
Fine.
We'll just let the police decide.
Whoa!
What makes you think they'll take your side?
Maybe cos you've been arrested Excuse me, one of those was for arson.
You're making a big mistake.
No, I'm not!
Yes, you are!
No, I'm not!
Yes, you are.
He didn't do it.
This citation says he was stopped at 4:20 at 18th and Wilson for urinating from a moving vehicle.
So?
The Circus Burger is on Walnut, which is at least 25 miles away.
He couldn't have been there during Reese's break.
If the traffic was light..
And if a '78 Bonneville could go 300 mph.
Otherwise, it's impossible.
Hey, way to go, Dewey!
Let me see that.
Is he right?
Yes.
He's always right.
Sorry, Richie.
Come on, Reese, let's go.
But I swear to God, I didn't take the money!
We still have a few hours.
Maybe we can figure I got the DVD player but we need to steal another 600 if you want the surround ..
sound.
You may wanna hang on to that receipt.
I can't believe you lied!
Let's call the cops!
Maybe we could figure out a deal?
Whatever you want, it's yours.
We get to use your place for a party any time we want.
Free burgers for life.
I get to make out with your girlfriend.
Forget it!
Alright, the bean bag chair.
Wow!
Pete, is that really you?
No, it's a reflection.
You can give these to Svetlana.
Eric and Artie should be back any minute with your bride.
I gotta be honest, I'm nervous.
You are about to marry a stranger.
Have you really thought about what you're doing?
I've been thinking about settling down for a long time.
But you don't know anything about her.
What if she thinks What if she doesn't like you?
I'd be sad but I'd reassure her I'd support her anyway, cos I made that commitment.
I'd spend the rest of my life being sweet to her.
And also changing her mind.
Well, good luck, Pete.
Thanks.
Svetlana's here, and she is gorgeous!
I must've misread the catalogue.
Just look how light on her feet she is.
Hey, guys.
Oh, hey, Pete Just get that thing outta here!
I'll take care of it.
I got it.
Why you?
Cos I signed for it!
Our ride.
How nice of Richie to drive you to school.
His way of saying thanks for a job well done.
Good morning, everybody.
Now, don't be disappointed Say good morning, Charlie.
Show everyone how alive you are!
Aren't I doing a good job?
Yeah, yeah.
Great.
That little monster!
He's been buying his own fish and switchin' 'em!
God only knows how many he's gone through.
He'll pay for this!
How?
If we bust him, he'll know we've been cheating.
We are so proud of the way you've taken care of that fish.
Yes.
You certainly proved to us you can be trusted.
It's so nice to have a boy who's so conscientious, responsible and honest and who finds a way to do the right thing.
Before we go any further, is there anything you wanna tell me?
I want a beagle!
You're not gonna get it, you little sneak!
You've been switching fish, cos I put a dead fish in there last night!
That's cheating!
You're cheaters!
It's not exactly textbook but at least we're not getting a dog.
I cleaned out my cubby.
You're sure I can't talk you into staying?
Mom says I need a healthier environment.
She thinks it's creepy you're using me for your own self-grandiosement.
That's not what you need.
You'll never connect normally with another human being.
People will recognise your brilliance and loathe you for it.
The best you can hope for is uncomprehending fear which I can channel into great things.
Please?
Can I go now?
Sure.
Go.
You, my ex-wife, all of my therapists, you're all the same.
Bye, guys.
Bye, Barton.
Good luck at NASA.
Send us a letter when you get declassified.
Mr Herkabe, we know this is hard for you, so It's his dad.
We photo-chopped your head in.
In a place where nappies are the law of the land tonight one big kid lives by his own rules with only his trusty new Huggies pull ups for night time.
He'll have the potty training pant with all the absorbency of a nappy.
Get ready for #I'm a big kid now.
#
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Mmm, I'm starving.
What's for dinner?
Leftover parfait.
It's even worse than it sounds!
Once a week Mom cleans out the fridge.
Anything that doesn't have something growing on it gets served for dinner.
Did we have spaghetti or Chinese food on Thursday?
Neither.
Ah!
No digging!
Sunday, Saturday, Friday.
It finally happened!
The fifth level of this week's leftover parfait is last week's leftover parfait!
# Yes, no, maybe # I don't know # Can you repeat the question?
# You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big # Life is unfair # Alright, everyone, these are your secret-shopper evaluations.
I'm going to be meeting with each one of you this week so we can discuss ..
how we can make improvements.
Look forward to it, sir!
Secret shoppers?
They had people spy on us?
What's next?
Cavity searches on the loading dock?
!
It's no big deal.
Companys do this kind of thing all the time.
But it's not fair!
How can I work hard if I don't even know they're watching me?
!
Calm down.
It's, like, a paragraph.
"Employees seem capable, efficient.
Personal hygiene was questionable".
Questionable?
!
What are they talking about?
My hy "Slovenly"?
!
They think I'm slovenly?
You're right.
This is ridiculous!
"Apathetic, lazy, overweight".
What planet are these people from?
I'm taking a fiver.
There's electricity in the air tonight, folks!
I'm open, I'm open!
We've been playing basketball with Dad since we could walk.
I'm open!
Oh!
Yes!
Another basket for Hal!
He's on fire!
We're 0 and 342!
We're starting to get a little discouraged!
Game point!
You take it out.
This is our last chance.
What do we do?
Give it to me!
Try another give-and-go.
Dewey, go to the basket and run around the pole.
Ooh!
That's it!
Pass!
I'm open!
Ooh, stolen by the Halinator!
He shoots He scores!
Hal-lelujah!
It was great game, boys.
Good hustle.
I hate this!
If I wanted to be humiliated, I'd take a math test!
Wait a minute.
Look.
Yeah.
Dewey, get away from that ball!
No.
He's making baskets.
He's never been able to do that before.
You're right.
That's how we're gonna beat Dad - with Dewey.
Which one of you filthy thieves has been rooting through my undies?
What are you talking about?
One of you went through my locker!
And ate all my jerky!
It wasn't us, Artie.
Looks like a rat did it.
Look at the teeth marks!
Don't jump to conclusions.
Think about it logically.
If the rat was so filled up with Artie's jerky, would he be chewing on Francis' pillow right now?
What?
!
Get him!
Die, vermin!
Wow!
Francis, you killed it!
And it did eat your jerky.
We got your double bag of paper and plastic.
The hair mousse is bagged separately and I picked your film for you.
Can I take this to your car?
You don't have to do that.
I insist.
That's my job here at Lucky Aide!
Ooh!
Bend forward.
Hi, Lois.
Mr Fisher, I wanted to talk about that secret-shopper report.
I think they must've come in when my son Dewey tried to cook breakfast.
By the time I put out the fire - Lois, this isn't personal.
It's It's not like I'm - Lois, there is nothing for you to freak out over.
We have people in the company with the skills and the experience to help you.
Wow, Lois!
This is, like, gonna be so fun!
OK, let's try it one more time.
Yes!
Perfect!
Dad won't have any idea what hit him!
He's going down!
Do you think he'll cry?
Oh, yeah, he'll cry!
You have pretty eyes.
You shouldn't hide them behind no makeup.
This is wrong.
I do my job.
I do my job well.
I dress appropriately and I'm clean.
That should be enough.
Or you could be pretty!
Put your chin up.
What do they want?
I have 3 kids, I run a house, I work 38 hours a week and they think I should look like a model just to ring up rash ointment?
You tell me how that's fair.
Lois, it's OK to be scared of change.
My boyfriend freaked when I got my driver's licence.
Don't worry, I'll take good care of you.
Oh, God, Hal!
You wouldn't believe what happened at work today!
I spent five hours with this stuff on my face in front of everybody!
I've never been so humiliated in all You're the most beautiful woman that ever was or ever could be!
Hey, Francis.
I heard you killed a rat yesterday.
Is that right?
What?
Yes, sir, he did.
Good.
I got a rat in my bunk.
I'd be obliged if you took care of it.
I don't think - He'd be honoured.
We both would.
Great.
What are you doing?
I don't know about killing rats!
Who cares?
!
You like mopping?
!
Do you wanna see what comes in during bear season?
Baby, bring it on!
What?
You think I'm scared of you?
I've changed your diapers!
Whoo-hoo!
Dewey, you made a basket!
Good for you!
Alright!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
What are you lookin' at?
Sorry, son!
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Rejected!
Good game, boys!
Good game?
!
You fouled us!
Boys, part of the game is learning how to lose gracefully.
If I've taught you anything it's how to be a good sportsman.
I guess the rat could be coming out of this hole.
What are you gonna do?
We could try to lure him out.
Anyone have a cookie?
It worked!
You did it!
I did.
Kill him!
< Go ahead.
Yes!
He did it!
That was amazing, Francis!
You have the gift!
Hi, Lois.
Thought I'd pick you up a latte.
Thanks.
What are you doing, Lois?
You shouldn't be lifting heavy boxes.
I always do it.
I'll take care of it.
Hold it a second.
You've watched me lift boxes for four years.
Now you want to help me?
Why?
I don't know.
I just thought - No!
Look me in the face and tell me why!
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna go get lunch, OK?
Can I get you anything?
How did it go?
Buzz, I don't wanna bore you with the technical details, so let's just say that cabin 15 is once again rodent free.
Three cheers for Francis!
Hip, hip!
Hooray!
What are you fools cheering about?
!
You caught yourself a couple of tiny rats.
Whoopdee-dee!
You ain't nothing until you take out a real rat.
You ain't nothing until you dance in the moonlight with Rosemarie!
Who?
They ain't told ya about Rosemarie, eh?
Well, she's the biggest, ugliest, meanest rat north of Kotzebue!
Lives right here under this here building!
Come on, Rosemarie ain't real!
Yeah, she's just a creepy old myth.
Like Stonehenge or boxing kangaroos.
She's as real as you and me.
So, what do you say, Rat Boy?
You think you're man enough?
Old man, you better start building a very small coffin.
## Fact - you can immunise your family against many infectious diseases.
But not the most common of all: food poisoning, often caught from raw meat and the surfaces it touches.
But use Dettol Surface Cleanser to kill 99.9% of bacteria wherever food has been prepared or stored, without leaving a taste in your mouth.
Dettol protects.
Fact.
Dettol Handwash also kills harmful bacteria on your hands.
Fact.
You're looking at the standard we set ourselves.
It's the one standard that measures the shine, the clarity and the brilliance you get with Finish Quantum.
It's only dishwashing, but we believe you deserve flawless results every time.
Finish Quantum.
So, recess here and I can get the dish off from Dewey.
See?
We just keep him with the ball round the perimeter.
He can't cover all three of us, no matter how dirty he plays.
Wow!
Very nice!
Great ball movement.
You guys are looking really good.
I'm impressed.
I'd be worried if I didn't have my patented fall-away jump shot.
Whoo!
Agh!
Ow!
Ow!
My ankle!
Oh, I twisted my ankle.
Help me into the house, boys.
Boys!
Sure, Dad.
We'll help you.
Ooh!
Hey, boys.
What's up?
Not much.
How's the leg?
A little better.
It's interesting how you happened to hurt your leg.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
It's just interesting.
Yeah.
Interesting.
What are you boys getting at?
Some people are willing to go to drastic lengths to avoid being beaten by their kids.
This is about basketball?
You think I faked this because I didn't wanna play you in basketball?
Alright.
You know what?
I'm gonna play you right now, like this, and I'm still gonna mop the floor with you.
That's OK.
You rest.
We can wait.
Yeah.
It's gotta heal sometime, right?
Here you go!
I had to move a couple dozen bags of charcoal briquettes, but I found the slightly-darker-blue one that you wanted.
I got a few spider bites, but it's OK as long as you go home satisfied.
You're welcome.
Excuse me!
Where are your dog toys?
Yes, ma'am.
They're right there.
Right behind you.
Those are leashes.
If I could direct your attention three inches right I want that little hot dog up on top.
Sure thing.
I see we have one just like it right here.
That isn't what I asked for.
This has mustard on it.
Peekaboo doesn't eat mustard.
That one has mustard on it, too, and since it's not even real mustard - Are you going to give me what I ask for?
Certainly.
There you go.
Thanks for shopping Lucky Aide.
This has mustard on it.
That's what I tried to tell you, you old bat!
Now, you're gonna take it to your dog and make him like it!
Lois.
I'm sorry to do this to you, but my brother got hockey tickets for tonight, and I know I said I'd close up for you - I've already rearranged my schedule!
And I covered for you last week.
Well, I'm sorry, Lois.
Gee, Tom, I really don't know what to do.
Isn't there any way at all you could be just a little late for your game?
Well, I guess so.
Thanks.
Hah!
Get your sneakers, faker.
Francis!
Yeah?
If you die, can I have your pillow?
I already promised it to Artie.
Gotcha.
I found her tracks!
You hear that?
He said I get his pillow!
Wait a minute.
I see something.
Oh!
I see a baby rat.
No wonder Rosemarie's so fierce.
She's a mother!
Go ahead and kill it!
I don't wanna kill a baby.
It's a rat!
Oh, alright.
Hey, this wood is rotten.
Just a second.
I think I can get through it.
No!
Yes!
That's 14-13.
We're up.
Game point.
You boys have put up a good fight, which is gonna make it more painful when I crush you like bugs.
Whoa!
Scored!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Tied game.
Next basket wins.
My ball.
We have to do The Play.
We can't!
We only practised it once.
It won't work.
It will work.
We just gotta believe.
It's go time, ladies.
# So you want a piece of me # Bring it on # Time is money, talk is cheap Bring it on # So if you're saying what you mean # Bring it on, yeah, bring it on # Bring it on, bring it on, bring it # Wow!
The future's now, old man.
# Bring it # Hey, Lois!
I just wanna thank you for the terrific job you've done this week.
You have shown a marked improvement in your performance and attitude.
That's nice of you to say, sir, but I've done nothing different.
There's that great attitude.
Anyhow, I think we're gonna have an opening soon in customer service.
Really?
It wouldn't be much of a pay rise, but you wouldn't have to work any more late nights.
That'd be great!
Now, you would have to dress up your appearance a little.
Excuse me?
You know, just a little more feminine.
More feminine?
Well, you're on the right track, just a little more.
Er, could I let you know tomorrow?
Sure thing.
Damn.
Hi.
Hello.
Can I help you?
I don't know.
Maybe.
What'll it cost me?
What?
Is it cheaper if we use my car, or do we have to get a room?
You think I'm a hooker?
No!
You do!
You think I'm a hooker!
Thank you!
Come with me!
A prostitute.
This guy was convinced I was a prostitute.
Ever since I got your stupid report, I have been feeling like everything I ever believed in was wrong.
Well, I think this little incident gives us both a much-needed clarity.
I'm gonna go home and wash my face.
When I come to work tomorrow, I'll do the same extraordinarily good job I've been doing all these years.
I'm going to do it in my 99-cent mascara and, if the mood strikes me, a hair clip and that's it.
If that's not good enough for you, so be it.
Thank you.
Well, Steve, are you gonna tell my sister, or should I?
This place is a pigsty!
Hal, will you hand me the?
Hal!
Fact - most cleaners remove dirt but could leave bacteria.
One bacteria could become two million overnight.
So some things that look clean aren't.
Dettol next generation All in 1 is unbeatable at cutting through tough grease, and powers through soap scum.
But, unlike ordinary cleaners, it kills 99.9% of bacteria, leaving surfaces clean and safe.

There it is.
Kill it.
A spider has as much right to live as you or I. Besides, it's unlucky to kill it in the house.
OK.
Hello, little fella.
Come on, sweetheart.
Oh!
Go, go, go!
Door!
Open the door!
The back?

Side.
No, back.
No, side!

Laurie will be there.
I've had a crush on her since third grade.
I haven't seen her since she moved last year.
I've grown four inches, but I can't count on that.
If I do 10,000 of these, I should have something to show by tomorrow.
No candy tomorrow, understand?
I'll be fine!
You won't.
What happened at the last company picnic?
I got into a fight with that red-headed boy.
Why did you do that?
Because I ate candy.
Because you ate candy.
You do not metabolise sugar well.
You get mean, crazy, get into fights and end up crying.
Do you want that to happen again this year?
No.
Get ready for bed.
OK.
What do you think?
This or this?
What are you doing?
!
This is an important function.
It's a company picnic.
Attended by my new boss whom I haven't met yet.
Gotta start off on the right foot.
You're making too much of this.
No, I am not!
You have to make a good first impression.
It sets the tone for the relationship.
Al, this is your new supervisor, Miss Plum.
I look forward to working with you.
Same here.
Oh, and what do we have here?
My big, fat sto-mach.
I'd like you to meet your staff, but I'm not sure where they are.
It is great to meet you, Mr Jacobson.
I want you to know I'm gonna do a terrific job for you.
Great.
Have you met my daughter and son-in-law?
No, I haven't.
Kelly?
Steve?
I want you to meet somebody.
Hi.
I'm Hal.
Hi.
So nice to Oh, my God!
There's a toothpick in my eye!
She's gushing blood!
Put a tourniquet on her neck!
I'm outside of my body.
I can see a light.
Grandma?
Is that you?
I'll chew off your face, spit it out and dance on it!
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna drag your carcass through the street.
She's got a toothpick in her eye!
It's like a chess game.
Every subtle move is vital.
Eight.
God, what did you do?
You're huge!
Shut up.
Be careful.
You might frighten Laurie with your savage manliness.
Who says I'm doing it for Laurie?
So Laurie's fair game?
I wonder if she likes older men.
Don't.
I really like this girl.
Please!
It's my first chance to see her since she moved away.
I'm asking you as a brother.
Please don't be a jerk and screw this up.
Wow, this desperate grovelling is new for you.
Keep it up.
Call yourselves a hockey team?
To beat McCallister Oil you'll have to play better than that.
You're making stupid mistakes, missing opportunities.
Keep your mind on the game!
Are our pay cheques here yet?
Aren't you done with that sink yet?
There's more than when I started.
You don't leave until it's finished.
It'd be faster if Eric helped.
I'm not letting my star player near that toxic filth.
I slave away by myself just because he plays hockey?
He doesn't just play hockey.
He skates like the wind.
He's got a 70mph slapshot.
Well, indoors, fresh ice.
We'll teach those thugs a lesson they won't forget.
Those chicks won't know what hit 'em.
You're playing girls?
The men won't play us till we beat the ladies' team.
Those girls play dirty, make fun of us, and steal our women.
Wow!
People who are more humiliated than me.
I'd love to see that.
Wish granted.
You're our equipment manager.
What?
!
Rinaldo came down with jock lung.
Here's your cheque.
Eric, there's a little extra for you.
Thanks.
There's no money in this cheque.
It says I owe you $14.
I didn't buy anything last week.
Cost-of-living increases.
Your room, board, pillow rental and the rubber gloves, princess This is insane!
I won't work 60 hours a week and still owe you money.
I quit!
Fine.
Give me the $604 you racked up and you can go.
What?
How can I have possibly $604 when you keep taking my money?
Shut up!
And get back to work.
Don't let your equipment-manager duties get in the way of your real work.
Man, that sucks.
Hello?
It's Francis.
I'm in a real bind.
I don't have any money.
"Hear me out".
Tell Mom they're sending the smart kids to Washington, DC, get $600 and spend a weekend at Stevie's.
Reese, phone.
Hello?
Reese.
You know the hardware store?
The entry way is slippery Dewey, phone.
Francis?
Yeah.
Money?
Yeah.
I don't know why I go to these things.
I am so nervous.
My stomach sounds like a bunch of dogs fighting.
Get your ear down there.
Hal, you'll be fine.
What are you doing?
Just keep moving.
Is your new boss even here?
They're all here.
There's Landon.
He's the head of the whole company.
Of course the new guy's here.
Don't talk nonsense!
You've never met him.
Do you know who you're hiding from?
That's a good point.
Is the new boss here yet?
Yeah.
He's right over there.
Let me know when you'll introduce yourself.
We figure you'll set him on fire.
Don't give him ideas.
Bet's off.
I'm nervous enough as it is.
We're just teasing you.
You'll do fine.
You and I both know that's a lie.
Yeah, well, I tried.
Hi, Mom.
Splendid day for a picnic.
You want to do this the easy way or the hard way?
The hard way.
Spread 'em.
I won't always be around to do this.
You have to control yourself.
I know.
Undies.
Malcolm?
Laurie, hi.
It is so good to see you.
Yeah.
Good to see you too.
I can't believe how tall you are.
Yeah, well, you know I've missed you guys so much.
I've missed you too.
I mean, we've all missed you.
Everyone.
Not just me.
Are you doing the three-legged hunt?
What?
They tie your leg to another person's and send you to find stuff.
You can win $100.
I just need a partner.
Do you want to do it?
Really?
Yeah, it sounds great.
Cool.
Is that your brother?
Hi, Reese.
Sorry.
I'm gay.
OK.

The diamond standard of dishwashing won't come from a dirty dishwasher.
Finish Dishwasher Cleaner is far better at removing hidden grease and limescale.
And a cleaner dishwasher means cleaner dishes.
It's only dishwashing, but you deserve perfect results every time.
.
Do you work for the company or are you a drag-along?
A drag-along.
Me too.
My husband drags me along then runs off and talks to his friends.
I hide.
Hide?
From my kids.
It's great to have somebody to talk to.
I'm bad at social situations.
My psychiatrist says I'm emotionally detached and that I have paranoid fantasies about what people think about me.
Uh-huh?
It can get really ugly.
False accusations, crying attacks.
I don't know why my husband married me.
I know why I married him.
I'm addicted to disapproval.
Ah.
Really?
Yeah.
Of course, I only have myself to blame.
He's exactly like my father was.
Oh, my God!
He was so judgemental.
Every time I spoke, I felt I was torturing him.
Wow, they're good.
They got nothing on my boy.
How's the diarrhoea?
You feeling alright?
Tiptop.
There's Lavernia.
I hear she might actually have a team this year.
Think we ought to adjust the front line?
Clarence?
Clarence!
What?
Hey, Lavernia!
I was afraid you'd show your face.
Not that I was afraid you'd play me, just that you'd show your face.
Hello, Clarence.
I thought you only gave pep talks in your van.
You'll get a boyfriend one day.
You'll have a moment of bliss, then you'll bite his head off and lay your eggs in his decapitated body.
Was that comment necessary?
That's why people don't like you.
People like me.
Who doesn't like me?
I got a good feeling about today.
These girls aren't so tough.
Wait till I get out there.
I'm gonna  How's my breath?
It seems fine.
Not too minty?
That can be just as bad.
Please give me back my compact.
OK, get in, get out, just say hello and go.
No.
Mr Landon.
Hello.
I told you about the first time I met this guy?
The urinal-cake guy?
Unbelievable.
But I didn't fire him.
He's one of our finest systems managers.
It goes to show that even a gibbering idiot can surprise you.
That would make a great chapter heading for your new book.
I thought he dropped his pill case.
Excuse me for being considerate!
Hi!
John Pratt.
It is a pleasure to meet you.
Hi.
You are a hard man to find.
I had to have someone point you out.
Well, it's not like I'm avoiding you.
I heard you had a great sense of humour.
I know it's gonna be great working with you.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I should get back to my family now.
Right.
Sorry to hold you up.
It is a real pleasure to meet you, Mr Landon.
Same here.
Boys, you got ten minutes.
Leave your wallets and valuables in here.
You gotta get out on the ice and warm up.
I don't think I can play.
My glute cramped up on the ride over.
You have to play.
Go lay down on that table.
You!
Get over there.
Give him a good, strong massage.
Work that knot out of his glute.
Out of his what?
No way!
He's our goalie.
We need him.
No!
Look, you owe me $604.
You do this, I'll take off $1.50.
$1.50?
!
And if you don't, I'll charge you $50 for the ride home.
The rest of you, get out there.
Show 'em what you got.
Here.
You're responsible for these valuables till after the game.
Don't be afraid to dig in deep.
If it helps, I'll unhitch the trap door.
Get up, you idiot!
Are you stupid?
Ow!
I said, hustle for the breaks!
Hustle!
I was in the locker room and the other coach approached me.
What's that reptilian sack of dog logs trying to pull now?
He wants to make a wager with you on the outcome of the game.
$642, to be exact.
I don't bet.
I earn my money and hold on to it.
He said you'd be afraid.
Oh, he did?
He also said John Grisham was a hack with no sense of plot and a tin ear for dialogue.
He said that about Mr Grisham?
Alright, he wants to bet?
We'll bet.
Tell him to make it 700.
He was pretty adamant about the $642.
Fine.
Hey, Chuck!
I need you to hold on to some bet money.
That idiot Clarence has no idea what we got in store for him.
Easiest 700 I ever made.
> What's with my skates?
The blades are so dull.
Somebody unscrewed mine.
I got Vaseline on my grip tape.
Go, go, go, go!
He is never home.
We last had dinner together six months ago with his boss!
Did I tell you about our anniversary?
I bought $30's worth of candles.
I wore a negligee the size of a postage stamp.
He walks in an hour late and spends six hours in a computer chat room.
I drank an entire bottle of champagne then I passed out.
I woke up with the dog licking my face.
And I actually thought it was my husband!
I'm gonna find my boys.
As if he would show me any kind of affection.
To him, I'm the fat lady that answers his psychiatrist's phone.
In my mind, I do see myself as a 200-pounder.
But I have seen the way other men look at me.
Wanda!
So good to see you again.
Wanda, Meg.
Wanda, Meg.
Why don't you get to know each other?
I'll be right back.
So, how do you know Lois?
Que?
I like you.
You're fun.
I like you too.
Want some of my candy?
Fill up on that bread.
It's better you get sick on that than on candy.
I got enough to worry about without you going crazy on me.
Stay here!
Hi, Lois.
Are you hiding back here?
No, just enjoying the shade.
Did you meet your new boss?
Yep.
How did it go?
Fine.
We hit it off.
What happened?
What do you mean?
It went well.
He likes me.
Is it so hard to imagine I made a good first impression?
Mr Landon?
You should give me a little credit.
Hey, boss!
Is he calling you?
Of course he isn't!
Whatever you were going to say, he isn't.
I'm not going anywhere until Lois!
Mr Landon!
Did I tell you that his mother is coming to visit me this week?
She despises me, but at least she talks to me.
My husband hasn't said two words besides, "Where's the remote"?
and "How far are those gonna sag"?
This isn't a good time.
Every year, he has to go to this stupid get-together for his friends from college.
We're about to go to this party and he tells me not to say anything stupid.
I embarrass him one time!
I didn't know who Ernest Hemingway was.
Alright, girls?
OK, Pete and Cathy, you're next.
It is so great to see you again.
Great to see you too.
For those of you without partners, we've done a random pairing.
Mike and Christina.
Reese and George.
I'm Reese.
I'm George.
You can call me George.
I can eat eight hot dogs.
That's good, George You've got to be kidding me!
It's weird being away from the friends I grew up with.
I bet.
Malcolm, can I ask you something?
Sure.
If you liked somebody, and you had no idea if they liked you back, would you say something?
I've always thought honesty was a good thing.
Me too.
But what if they lived too far away and it'd be really hard?
I like you too, Laurie.
I really like you.
Honestly, you have no idea.
I've liked you for years.
I think about you all the time.
Oh, no!
What?
Oh, my God!
I am so sorry!
I was talking about Gary Spindler!
Oh, no!
Erm, it's OK.
No!
This is so humiliating!
It's all my fault.
Malcolm, I am so sorry!
Really, it's not that "Malcolm and Laurie".
Remember, you're only going to be tied together for three hours.
Let's get hopping.
Get great results all around your home when you try new Cillit Bang Multi Power.
It was so quick and easy.
Look how it cleans this toothpaste

'Previously,' It's a company picnic!
Attended by my new boss whom I haven't met!
I like her.
Don't screw this up!
Laurie, hi!
It's so good to see you!
Keep moving.
Is your new boss here?
They're all here!
There's Landon, head of the company.
I woke up with the dog licking my face.
I thought it was my husband!
I better see what my boys are doing.
It is a real pleasure to meet you, Mr Landon!
Er, same here!
You're playing girls?
!
The men won't play us until we beat the ladies.
You're responsible for these.
The coach wants to make a wager.
What's up with my skates?
The blades are dull!
Somebody unscrewed mine!
If you liked someone, would you tell them?
I like you, too.
Oh, my God!
What?
I was talking about Gary Spindler!
You're going to be tied together for three hours.

Come on, Malcolm, we're still friends!
We can still have fun, right?
Why don't you help me with this clue?
"North of the fork and up a small hill, under a joke without J is a yellow bill".
This doesn't make any sense!
You'd think they'd make sense!
Gary Spindler?
!
Malcolm!
What do you see in him?
He high-fives people when they decide what they want on their pizza!
He still says, "It's the bomb"!
"Hi, I'm Gary.
I have a laser pointer"!
He's nice.
Can we concentrate on the scavenger hunt or we'll fall behind!
It's a yellow duck under that oak tree there.
Joke without J, oke.
Oak tree.
The fork was back there.
Wow, you were right!
That's great, Malcolm!
You're good at this!
Yes, I am.
I have a lot of other good qualities.
There's lots of things to like about me if I was given half a chance!
Can we just do this?
Fine.
OK, clue number two.
"Look for this gem on an overgrown hem".
"Stay to your right or it might take all night".
For God's sakes!
Gary Spindler?
!
What's going on out there?
We've gone back two goals!
I can't get speed with these skates!
Get them sharpened!
I already had Francis sharpen them twice!
Besides, number 32 is amazing!
She's a monster!
She's crippled our front line!
Sorry to take you away from your family, Mr Landon.
About this Mr Lan- I know, Bert.
Bert, I need your help!
The cubicle dwellers are getting restless.
Ah.
Apparently they know about my reputation for downsizing.
I thought you could shoot them a little BS to calm them down.
Actually, I Great!
Hey, everybody!
I know there are some concerns here so I've brought Mr Landon over to put your minds at ease.
Now, he's taking time away from his family so not too many questions.
This is beautiful!
Phil, Mr Landon would like to put our minds at ease!
Isn't that right, Bert?
Hal?
!
Ah, Bert.
Albert.
Halbert.
Hal!
You know?
I'm sensing a lot of confusion here but the keyword to keep in mind is loyalty.
When you're worried about your job it's very tempting to make a fellow co-worker look bad but who really cares if someone's wife's an alcoholic ..
or that someone has an unnatural attraction to women in suits?
The important thing is we're in this together!
And remember, nobody likes a snitch!
So, let's have a great picnic, huh?
Hah-hah!
"Go north of the fork and up a small hill".
"Under a joke without J is a yellow bill".
I don't see a fork.
I saw a broken spoon!
Shut up!
I'm trying to think of a joke without a lot of Js in it!
Ohh, I found a cup.
You're supposed to look for a fork!
You know, a fork?
The little thing with things!
Geez!
You go.
I'll stay here.
We're tied to each other, you idiot!
Oomph!
Ooh!
Oomph!
Aaah!
Got it!
Five more and we win!
Five more and we win.
You're a genius!
Thanks.
You're, er, big.
Help!
Yeah!
Lavernia, looks like we're gonna make it nine years in a row!
Maybe we should put our pregnant girls in, make it more of a game!
Wh-Who is that helping?
All that's gonna do is make her feel bad plus now all our pregnant girls are gonna wanna get in the game!
Number 32 is killing us!
Looks like it's time for a little strategy!
# "Bad To The Bone" Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Oomph!
Argh!
Eric!
Yeah!
Now let's play some hockey!
You were amazing!
I would never have found those kids without you!
You know something?
Together we make the perfect three-legged person!
I wish we could stay like this forever!
Yeah.
Wait!
Why can't we?
There's people that do surgeries!
You're the smartest guy I've ever met!
Thanks, buddy.
We've got to find that fork.
Hey, I want candy!
What did I tell you?
Sit in that chair until the picnic is over!
Excuse me?
Are you Lois?
Yes.
Where do you get off talking to my wife about my mother?
!
I wet my bed every night until I was 16.
My mother changed those sheets for years and never said a word!
I don't care if they don't get along.
My mother's important to me.
I never said anything about your mother!
By the way, I don't have a porn problem!
She introduced it into our home!
I don't have any interest - It was her idea and now I'm the pervert!
I don't know what it is about porn.
Maybe it's the safety of emotional distance!
That's it!
If you're gonna make me do this we're gonna do this.
Now sit down!
Your problem is you both see yourselves as victims.
You've got to talk to each other.
There's a thing called give and take to make it work.
Do you understand?
Yes.
I'm not finished!
If you're gonna make this work you have to make sure that you are home every night at 6:30, not 6:35.
Create an atmosphere of trust.
I think we might win!
Damn right!
I've got 600 bucks riding on it!
What are you doing?
You're a man short.
Where's Amis?
He ran out yelling about government helicopters and murderous clones.
'Hello?
Is anybody there?
' Don't worry.
I'll cover for him.
Alright.
You're a good man, Francis.
I'm doing what anybody would do.
Sorry.
.
I've always loved Elnett.
You know why?
Elnett from L'Oreal Paris.
It's so fine.
It: My hair feels like satin.
It holds perfectly.
For me, it's the best hairspray in the world.
And now: Because you're worth it.
It's important to protect your teeth from the build-up of invisible plaque.
But how do you fight something that's invisible?
Simple.
Orbit Complete with xylitol helps protect teeth from plaque.
WHOOSH!
WOMAN EXHALES RATTLING WHOOSH!
New Dove go fresh deodorant in cool cucumber & green tea.
Stay dry, go fresh.
Hey, look at this!
We're doing great!
You're so good at this.
Stop!
What are you doing?
!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Just tell me, what's your big problem with me?
Malcolm!
Seriously, I want to know!
Am I too short?
Am I too smart?
Malcolm, can we please drop this?
I'm smart.
Is that a crime?
I'm sorry I'm not a moron like Gary Spindler!
Malcolm, stop it!
What are you doing?
Tell me why you don't like me.
Why are you doing this?
I want an answer!
I can't believe I liked you!
You liked me?
!
I knew it!
I wasn't crazy!
You did like me!
So what the hell has changed?
Tell me!
I defy you to tell me!
Nothing!
That's the problem!
You're still the obsessive whining know-it-all who doesn't listen!
But you did like me!
Malcolm, I DON'T like you!
Can you get that through your head?
Before I just didn't have a crush on you.
And now I can't stand you!
You want me to tell you why I don't like you?
You want me to tell you why I like nice, funny Gary Spindler and absolutely despise bitter annoying Malcolm?
Do you?
Look, Well, I'm gonna tell you!
There is something wrong with you!
I don't know how you do it!
You're cute, smart, funny and somehow you managed to mess that up!
Like today.
It was an awkward situation, but it would've passed.
But you just kept picking at it and picking at it until it turned into this big horrible thing!
There is something wrong inside you!
There's something rotten at the core of your personality!
You're just off!
That's not even the worst thing!
I want candy!
I opened my purse to get a Tic Tac and he dropped out of a tree on my back!
I am so sorry!
Now you go and you sit down in that chair and you put your head down!
OK.
Did you straighten things out with Pratt?
Almost.
Oh, for God's sake, Hal!
Where is he?
I'll talk to him.
No!
It's too late now.
It would be awkward.
Hal, you work with the man.
He'll find out!
It'll be two seconds of embarrassment and then it's over.
Now go!
Pratt, do you have a moment?
For you, Bert?
Of course!
You're fired!
What?
I don't think it's working out.
I haven't started yet!
What could you be basing this on?
My gut.
I didn't get this far without trusting my instincts.
I'm sorry, son.
I think it's best if you just leave the picnic now.
They have foil if you wanna wrap that up.
I'm so sorry, Malcolm!
I just started talking and I couldn't stop.
And I said all those mean things.
I didn't even mean half of them!
Who am I to say that your kids would be screwed up?
You might not even have kids!
Are you OK?
I think I can stop crying now.
Can you get me more leaves?
Oh, Malcolm!
No, really, I'm fine.
No, Malcolm, that's poison oak!
Of course it is!
Take the shot!
Ahh, geez, guys!
Am I bad?
!
How could I have done that?
!
Ahh, don't beat yourself up, buddy.
We all make mistakes.
Shake it off.
You're doing your best.
Eric, I'm doing terrible!
Why's everybody being so nice to me?
You're doing your best!
You're part of the team.
We're in this together.
You boys have all the items on the list.
Plus a wallet, a girl's bracelet and a fork.
Give us the 100 bucks.
There you go.
Thanks.
How about we separate you two?
I'll miss you!
Nice Mom, you don't have to hold on to me.
I'll be good!
OK!
Lois!
You don't have to thank me.
Let me enjoy the rest of the picnic.
You told my husband I'm insane and should be committed!
I didn't say that!
Then how does letting him video-tape us in bed help our marriage?
What?
!
I didn't tell You've gotta stop this!
I don't have time for my own family's problems without listening to you two nutcases!
So why don't you just  Oh!
I don't think you understood me.
Ohhh!
# I don't give a damn what the people say # I'm gonna do it my way, gonna do it my way # I'm gonna let it all out Just doing my thing # A boom-lah-boom and a bang, bang, bang # Boom, bang, boom, bang-bang # Boom, bang, boom, bang-bang # Ahhh!

Er, I don't think I Eric, there's something I've gotta tell Dammit!
Get up!
Do something!
Ooomph!
No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!
Eric, are you OK?
Someone took the cup out of my jock!
I'll be fine.
Just win this thing!
Ohhh!
Now, just to be clear, I'm not looking for anything long term here.

# Go, go, go!

# Go, go, go!
#  Yes!
Yeah!
You did it, man!
Alright!
Way to go!
Let me collect my money so we can treat Francis the way he deserves!
You know, there's a funny story about that money.
Yeah!
You boys did alright!
Yeah, it was fun.
Francis, how you doing?
Well, cold!
It won't be much longer.
There's a kid's skating party in a half hour!
Dewey!
> Dewey, is that?
Oh, my God!
Dewey, get away from there!
Oh!
Alright, alright.
Everything's gonna be alright.
Come on, baby.
Come to Mamma!
Everything's gonna be OK.
Everything's gonna be OK.
Everything's gonna be Who's that idiot that just pulled out and flipped everyone off?
That's Pratt, sir.
He starts this week.
No.
No.
The only thing he starts this week is a long lifetime of misery.
You have our friends at the IRS give him a call.
So, maybe we can hang out sometime or something.
When you're better.
Oh, come on, Malcolm!
It's not that bad.
Give me a smile!
Are you smiling?
I can't tell.
I'm smiling.
That went better than I expected.

Dewey?
Come on out, honey!
How does he know he's going to the doctor?
I certainly didn't say anything!
Dewey?
Son?
Dewey?
Dewey, come on out!
We love you, son.
Dewey, come on, we're gonna be late!
Oh, poor little thing.
Go start the car.
# "Boss Of Me" - They Might Be Giants Awesome dinner, Mom!
Those are the best fish sticks I've ever had!
Seriously, I don't know how you do it.
The microwave.
But for the perfect amount of time.
I'd better clear my plate and start my homework.
I thought he was sick, but tomorrow he's old enough to get his learner's permit.
He's on his best behaviour until he passes the test.
Can I get anyone a nice cup of peppermint tea?
Helps digestion.
Mom and Dad have been looking for any excuse to ground him, but he hasn't screwed up once in three weeks!
It's actually getting kinda boring.
Aah!
Didn't think so.
Remember, Dad, you're picking me up from school to take me to the DNV.
I wouldn't miss it, son.
We're gonna have to face it, that kid is gonna be mobile.
Reese surrounded by and 20 gallons of explosive fuel?
!
It's like giving a shark a sub-machine gun!
Hello?
Hey, Dad.
Francis!
Hi, how are you?
We haven't heard from you in so long!
Yeah.
You know how I've always been impulsive and independent-minded, but basically just unlucky?
What?
Well, there's been a certain incident here and without going into the blame game, let's just say there's been some damages.
That's why you're calling?
No, you can't do that any more.
You're on your own, you've emancipated yourself, remember?
You can't run to your parents for money at the first sign of trouble!
I'm not running to my parents, I'm calling as one adult to another for an adult loan.
No!
You've made whatever mess you've made and you take care of it!
I have been taking care of it!
I got Big Red to cut me the lumber in exchange for fur-lined boots.
I got Pete to make the boots, but only because I promised him a new set of teeth.
As you probably know, teeth don't come cheap!
And that's where you  Hey, Dave!
You know that digital camera Bernie got that you like?
Yeah?
Well, what would you pay if I could get it for you?
You can get Bernie to give up his camera?
Absolutely!
I've been waiting for this my whole life!
Once I'm driving, everything changes.
I've got to stay out of trouble for the next 16 hours and I'm home free!
How's that?
A little tighter on this side.
OK, you're all set.
Now, remember, do not untie me until the morning, no matter what I say or how much I beg.
Got it.
Uh-oh, I gotta go to the bathroom.
Too bad.
Just testing.
Thanks, buddy.
It's weird.
Reese suddenly doesn't seem as irritating as he used to.
It's amazing what a driver's licence can do for a relationship!
Hi.
Dewey, I am warning you, if you even touch me, you can forget about me driving you anywhere for the rest of your life!
I have nowhere to go.
Hello?
Hi, Lois, it's Craig.
I can't talk right now, er, I'm on the other line.
Only take a second.
I have something to say to you that I only feel comfortable saying because we're like family.
Your son Malcolm is a filthy vandal.
What?
!
He threw eggs all over the front of my new apartment.
Him and his wheelchair friend.
They wanted some free candy, I said no, next thing I know, it's like D Day here.
Malcolm, get in here!
You'd think I'd be the last person he'd target after I forgave your family for burning my old place down, which I'd like to remind you, I hardly ever mention.
Craig, I am so sorry!
Well, boys will be boys.
All I want is for him to come over and clean it up.
If he could get me a non-fat latte along the way, that would be great.
Don't worry, he's on his way.
What is the matter with you, throwing eggs at Craig's door?
!
What are you talking about?
I did it, I did it!
You passed the test?
I aced it!
You got five wrong!
Yeah, but I got If the DNV was running my school, I'd be, like, a C student!
Well, congratulations.
Send the cheque to the driving school?
Yes, Reese.
You sure you signed it?
It's not gonna bounce?
Everything is fine.
Just go there straight after school tomorrow.
You guys are the best!
I promise when you're old and crazy, I'll drive to the home and visit you Maybe go for a drive round the park.
Would you like that?
I can't wait Why are you still here?
Get over to Craig's, start cleaning!
I didn't throw anything at his door, I swear!
Why would a grown man lie about something like that?
!
I lied because I needed your help.
I finally got my insurance settlement.
This receiver works at both SRS 5.1 and DTS.
Subwoofer for surround sound, progressive-scan DVD player.
Plays both AIFF and MP34 on either CDs or CDRs.
I figured you'd be comfortable with this.
I mean, the guys at the store couldn't find the graphic equalisers with two hands and a flashlight.
You got me here to hook up your stereo?
Can't you get one of your friends to help you?
And tick off the other friends I didn't ask?
Malcolm, this goes far beyond just a stereo.
This is going to be the greatest entertainment centre ever.
Have you ever wanted to be the best at something?
Not just good, I don't mean great, I mean the absolute best?
I don't know.
Well, I have.
Ever since I was a kid watching Land of the Lost on my tiny black and white six inch.
I knew there'd be a day, a day when I could create my high-def universe.
A magical realm where fantasy and technology intersect on my every whim because I'm the King.
So your lifelong dream was to become the world's best TV watcher?
Yeah.
I'm in!
I still can't believe it!
For the first time ever, I'm gonna be ..
behind the wheel!
I have to go to Craig's after school.
You still have more to clean up?
Yeah.
I made a hell of a mess.
Hey, Dewey, I want you to know there's no hard feelings about the last couple of weeks.
Yeah, they're brand new.
The college boy got 'em for me.
This is awesome!
Willy's grandson will love this!
Remember, you gotta get that sled team out to Camp Three before dark.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
You've driven dogs before, right?
What do I look like?
Stop worrying!
Neil, you know how to drive a dog team?
Yeah.
Do you still have a crush on Joe's sister?
Yeah, but Joe won't let me date her just cos I'm Irish ..
and I got a bounty on my head.
Lemme see what I can do.
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry!
Ooo, sorry!
I'm sorry!
Ooo, sorry!
Damn it!
I thought I paid this gas bill already!
You're doin' great.
Turn right, you're ready for street drivin'.
What?
!
Jackie's been driving for half an hour!
Her turn is over!
It's only been 10 minutes, Reese!
I've been timing you!
You've been driving exactly 27 minutes.
You're gonna use up my turn!
When did you learn to tell time?
It's digital.
I can't believe I have to be in the same car as a low life like you!
Oh, I'm a low life?
You spend everyday at lunch sucking on a straw that's been under my armpit!
You pig!
That's it, I've had it!
I don't even know what text messaging is, how can they charge me Malcolm?
Don't connect those cables, their impedance values aren't equal!
You'll get a reflected transmission.
That's what the scan modulation is for!
Trust me, 480P is more than enough to take care of it.
Then I can't use the analogue pre-amp to play my SACDs.
You're tired, you're not thinking right!
I'm using single-ended interconnects for the front left-right speakers!
Are you mad?
You can't do that!
Just watch me.
I know it sounds weird, but this is the most fulfilling conversation I've had in weeks.
Shouldn't there be a signal to tell these cars to get out of the way?
Does anyone see a thingy of stamps by their feet?
It's been 45 minutes!
I'm not gonna get my turn!
OK, pull over.
Finally!
I just need to go to the post office.
Oh, God, look at that line.
What are you doing?
It's my turn!
Oh, sorry, doesn't look like we'll have enough time.
But you got very valuable watching experience.
We'll get to you next week.
Slide over.
No way!
Ugh!
I at least get to drive back to the stupid school.
I'm not going home without at least touching the steering wheel.
What was that?
!
You crashed!
No, I didn't.
The car's not even in drive!
Yeah, well, you're behind the wheel, what are you gonna do now, hotshot?
Ah!
I'm so sorry, I Aaarrrggghhh!

But with new Pedigree Joint Care +, you could see a real difference.
One treat a day for just six weeks, and you'll soon see why you can't keep a good dog down.
So, let's see, you've got grand theft auto, malicious crashing and what else?
Oh, yeah, kidnapping me!
I knew you'd go to prison, I just figured it'd be after prom.
Shut up and let me think about this!
Do you realise you are driving 20mph on a freeway?
I am not getting a speeding ticket on top of everything else!
Will you just leave me alone and let me figure this out?
Ha!
OK, don't panic, it's just a cop, that's nothing.
You can handle one stupid cop.
Oh, man!
What are you doing?
Aren't you pulling over?
I don't know.
I think I'm still going.
If you're being chased by the cops and they say pull over, you have to.
That's the law!
Yeah, well, even so You can't!
You know, that's a really good plan, Reese.
There's just one little problem with it.
This is a driver's ed car!
Oh!
Those cheap sons of!
Don't start screaming at me about Francis!
I haven't seen him!
I spent hours digging post holes cos he promised me a satellite dish!
He promised me a satellite dish!
Where the hell's my George Foreman grill?
I'm just as mad as the rest of you.
I'm pretty sure these teeth came off a dead guy.
Tastes like a Canadian.
Well, he's through taking advantage of me!
Pierre, your identical American cousin is in a heap of trouble.
Oui.
Another half turn.
Easy!
Easy, don't strip it.
Got it!
Beautiful!
Now all we have to do is adjust it.
Congratulations!
It was pretty hairy, especially with the hub connectors.
Stripping quarter inch off the leads was inspiring.
I hardly remember it.
I was running on adrenaline!
You know, Craig, I gotta tell you, this was a lot of fun.
I actually enjoyed spending time with you.
You didn't have to lie to get me over here.
Yes, I did.
Yeah, OK, but you wouldn't now.
I guess what I'm trying to say is, you know, I'm sorry for all the times we made you miserable.
It's OK.
You're a good guy.
I like you.
Run down and check the signal, will ya?
OK.
And try not to screw it up, buddy.
We're getting 42 percent!
Try moving the dish a little to the right.
A little more!
"A low-speed chase involving a teenager, a driver's ed car and what appears to be a hostage".
"It all happened so fast.
They just took off".
"With my chequebook and all my financial papers in the car".
"That's not an excuse, I just hope that B of A understands the situation".
"The hostage is unharmed, but it's a matter of time before police end it - one way or the other".
Oh, no!
Now they're never gonna let me drive!
How's it looking?
Malcolm?
Malcolm!
I can't hear you!
You're not watching without me, are you?
Whaa!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Just let me talk to him and I can end this in five minutes!
I'm sorry, I don't think that's a good idea.
We have psychologists to handle kids in these situations.
We know how they think.
Think?
!
My son doesn't think!
He's driving in circles.
He's made three laps around the city already!
There's our dry-cleaner again.
Here's another picture of my brother you can show on TV.
Just get him on the phone and let me handle this.
I'm the only one who knows how.
Trust me, we have it under control.
Don't think I don't know what's gonna happen!
You're gonna do your standard police thing and my son is gonna get shot!
Ma'am, that almost never happens.
Just get him on the phone!
Tell him if he wants to see daylight again, he'll pull over this instant!
"Your mother wants you to know that she loves you and" He has 10 seconds to pull over that car or I will!
"Give you lots of hugs and kisses".
You heard your mom, you're not in trouble.
Can you pull over now?
That's not my mom.
Please, dear God, I know I haven't been a saint, but I swear, if you Ah!
Aaaarrrggghhh!
No, Daddy, this is not my fault, I'm just a passenger.
How is this making you look like a chump?
I'm the one Hold on.
Hello?
No!
No, I'm on the other line.

Hi, I'm back.
No, I was not talking to Mom, it was the Daddy, I don't care who she's No, I will not tell her!
You have to stop putting me in Go ahead.
Go ahead, cancel the card, cancel all my cards!
I'm gonna be in this car for the rest of my life, anyway.
OK, I've got an idea.
What?
There's a railroad crossing about a mile ahead.
If we jump out a second before the train squashes the car, we can start new lives as circus people.
Reese, come on, this is getting scary.
What are you gonna do?
"This is your last warning".
"Pull over or you will be forced from the road".
Jackie, I have to tell you something.
Just because I hate you doesn't mean I'm not sorry.
What?
I didn't mean to get you into this!
It's just that I'm not You know, I'm not very smart.
So when I get in trouble, I panic, then I do things that make it worse.
I'm really sorry.
And your dad is a tool.
Hey, I was just kidding about the kidnapping thing.
You have enough to worry about without me being a jerk about it.
Wait a second!
Jackie, gimme your phone!
I have a brother who's a total genius, he'll know what to do.
How many police cars are behind you?
I don't know, eight, maybe nine.
What are we gonna do?
There's no way out!
Sometimes things look their darkest right before the sun breaks through.
And sometimes you just have to realise that the game is over and that you've lost.
The The only left thing to do is to stop running, stand up and face the consequences like a man.
And And even if the outcome is more horrible than you could've imagined, you can hold your head up high, show some class and end it with dignity.
Class?

He's turning.

Nice!

It was!
OK, that's impressive.
Look, he's pulling over!
I think he's gonna parallel park!
No way!
The spot is way too small!
He hasn't given himself enough space!
He did it!
Now just get out of the damn car, please!
Reese, that was amazing!
Listen, when the kids at school ask you about this, ..
tell them I got under your bra.
I'll call the lawyer and have him meet us there.
Give 'em a reason, give 'em a reason!
"The suspect appears to be resisting".
"Oh, looks like they're taking out the pepper spray".
"Argh!
Argh"!
Why do we have to have to dress like this?
It's his hearing!
I want the judge to see that Reese comes from a respectable family that loves him very much!
Why aren't they trying him as an adult?
Come on, we gotta go!
I have to go to Craig's.
He's getting his cast off and wants me to videotape it.
Craig's talking already?
Good for him!
I was really creeped out by that one blink yes, two blinks no stuff.
No, you got it the other way around.
One blink means no.

Wait, wait.
I had no idea homework could be so funny.
It's suicide.
I don't care.
I'm going in.

I just got back from the doctor.
My spine is curved!
How bad?
No gym for two years.
Brilliant!
Maybe my third nipple can get me out of wrestling.
Here comes Her Royal Bitchiness.
Cynthia just got back from a semester in Europe and she's totally changed.
She's bitter and sarcastic.
I could pull it off, but on her it's really unpleasant.
Malcolm, can you move the herd to move an inch to the left so I could get past?
I'm sorry, did you say inch?
Don't you mean 2.54 centimetres or 0.254 decimetres, or 25.4 million nanometres?
Guys, stop teasing her.
You stink at it.
Don't defend her, Malcolm.
If I wanted abuse I'd talk to my oboe teacher.
She's dead to us.
Hey.
Are you OK?
What do you mean?
You've been acting kinda strange.
Malcolm, look around and reconsider your definition of strange.
Fair enough.
Dad, look how high my kite is!
That's great, son.
That's terrific.
You wanna try?
Er, no.
Why not?
I don't like kites.
Why not?
I don't like kites and they don't like me.
We don't get along.
You'd like it if you tried it.
Come on, just try it.
Hold the string.
Agh!
Hey, Lois.
Karen, what are you doing out there?
Come on in.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to lurk.
I was working up the nerve to talk to you.
Are you OK?
You look different.
I'm sober.
Oh.
Yeah.
After I drove over that miniature golfcourse they made me get into a 12-step programme.
Good for you!
Thanks.
I'm up to the part where I'm supposed to make amends to people I've hurt.
What did you ever do to me?
Remember New Year's at Deb and Rich's where everyone was kissing at midnight?
Yeah.
When I kissed your husband I stuck my tongue in his mouth.
I felt terrible, then I put my cigarette out on Richard's toupee You were French-kissing my husband?
He pushed me away after, like, five or six seconds.
Well, no more than ten.
I'm sure he was only moving his tongue because he was trying to say something.
That's enough, Karen.
Sorry.
Now I have to tell Stephanie she can take down those lost-dog posters.
Francis, it's Friday night.
Can we please go out and get hammered?
Is getting drunk all you think about?
We work like dogs all day, drink, then work like hungover dogs.
Is this how you pictured your life?
Ever since I was little.
What did you picture?
I don't know.
There's more to life than falling down drunk and acting like a jackass.
Look what we found!
You stole a totem pole?
No, he asked to come with us.
He hasn't shut up for an hour.
You can't leave it here.
People worship these.
It's a sacred object.
Do I have something in my teeth?
Be honest.
What's wrong with you?
You see a symbol of a world beyond scraping grease and you think, let's profane it in our cabin?
Don't you have respect for anything?
Look, a penny!
It's mine!
I saw it first!
Is my coffee ready yet?
I can't believe you only have instant.
Sorry it's not up to your standards.
You'd seem more sophisticated if you weren't wearing a kiddies' sweater.
I'd take style tips from someone who keeps track of wrestling feuds?
Ever since you've been back you've been mean.
You think you're better than us.
Even if it's true, you don't have the right to be nasty.
You won't have any friends soon.
You think you know what everybody's problem is?
You think you're so smart and together, and no-one notices what an unhappy little person you are.
Well, sorry.
I won't stroke your fragile ego by confiding in you.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're on fire!
Aaaagh!
Mommy!
How could you do that to me?
You were on fire.
I wanted to help.
By yelling, "Oh, my God, where did those come from"?
I'm sorry!
It's just, you scared me.
THEY scared me.
I mean, they startled me I hate this!
Everyone looks at me like I'm some kind of freak.
I was surprised, that's all.
I mean, I would react the same way if you had a new haircut.
No-one can know about this.
You can't tell anyone.
What?
Promise me!
But Promise!
Alright, I promise!
Come on, you're fine.
It's just a change on the outside.
Inside you're the same.
If you give people a chance they'll see that.
Stop staring at them!
Am I staring?
Dad, I've been thinking about your kite problem.
I don't have a kite problem!
It's OK, Dad.
We could start with you explaining why you hate kites.
Let me try it!
I want to try it!
Fine.
Here.
Jerk!
Help!
I just do!
There doesn't need to be a reason!
Doesn't Dewey get homework?
He seems to have a lot of time on his hands.
Something wrong?
I had the most interesting conversation with Karen.
She's in this programme where you have to apologise to your loved ones and I wondered, do I have anything to apologise for?
By you, you mean ME, and since it's a question, you know the answer.
Karen said you French-kissed her on New Year's Eve.
I did not!
I can't believe it!
You're actually accusing me of this?
Why would Karen lie?
Why would I lie?
For the past 20 years yours has been the only tongue that's been in my mouth.
I don't lie!
So can we fly kites tomorrow?
Sorry, son I have to testify at a murder trial.
But, darn it, I'll go to the park with you!
Thanks, Dad.
It wouldn't be so bad if you'd just admit it.
Lois, why would I kiss Karen?
You're a MAN!
What's that supposed to mean?
You've been with the same woman for 20 years.
It's natural to be curious.
About what?
In 20 years of marriage you've never even thought about another woman?
What are you talking about?
If you're just gonna be ridiculous, there's no point in carrying on this conversation.
But you are on notice!
Wait!
I wanna talk to you!
You are unhappy!
Yes, I am.
Why?
I may have ruined my life.
I left my family and friends to come up here.
I wanted to find myself, but all I feel is empty.
I have the answer to your suffering, Francis.
The answer is Francis!
Who was that spiky-haired kid who was friends with Little Lou?
What?
Don't worry.
Maybe it'll come to you if you sleep on it.

You guys threw fridge magnets at Dabney's back brace?
He was walking around all day with "Florida is for Lovers" on his back.
That laugh is so not cute.
I'm sorry my laugh isn't as melodious as your cracking voice.
I'm Malcolm.
I have all the answers but no-one listens to me Funny!
This was fun.
Hi, Reese.
What a pig!
What?
She was never that great, but now it's like she's TRYING to be ugly.
Shut up!
She's not in Europe any more.
In America, we take showers.
She doesn't smell.
She dresses like a bag lady.
I know, her butt is gigantic and she's trying to hide it.
This is great!
I have a wide-load sticker, and I can make the truck noise when she backs up - beep, beep, beep!
Reese, when is she gonna back up?
OK.
When's her lunch period?
I can sneak in and throw bacon at her.
THEN she'll back up.
Beep, beep She's not hiding her butt, she's hiding her big boobs!
So if you tease her you're just gonna look like a. You are a good, good brother.
No I lied!
Her butt IS huge!
I think it helped Cynthia to talk.
She's in a better mood.
She even stuck her homework on Dabney's back.
Agh!
What're you doing?
!
Algebra.
What did he say to you?
Malcolm, calm down!
I'm just helping him with his homework.
Reese doesn't care about school.
So I thought, but when he asked me for help he sounded so pathetic, I couldn't say no.
How are you doing on number five?
Awful.
I'm not gonna get this.
I'm such an idiot.
No, you're not.
Everyone says I'm an idiot all the time.
Well, he IS!
Malcolm.
It's not his fault.
Someone at some point decided I was dumb, and that's all anyone ever sees in me.
Why do they always focus on one detail, never the whole person?
I don't know.
You missed another shift!
I'm not walking away from this totem pole when I'm this close to figuring out what it's trying to tell me.
Have you eaten anything?
Fasting helps my meditation.
There's some kind of energy here.
It gave me that dream.
It's trying to help me.
We're getting rid of it and putting you back on corn dogs and porn for your own safety.
Back away from the pole!
So you guys wanna go shoot some eagles?
Nothin' else to do.
What're you gonna do to her?
I don't know what you're talking about.
OK.
I've been dying to tell someone.
Malcolm, I'm gonna see them.
What?
!
I'll make her my girlfriend and get her to take her top off.
You're crazy!
That's what I thought, but I've got it all figured out.
Tomorrow I reveal an embarrassing secret that makes her feel trusted.
Friday, sneak a kiss, then apologise.
Monday, I ask her out.
She catches me crying.
Make out.
She finds love letter in my pocket.
Heavier make-out session.
All culminating in March 8, DD-Day.
You're pure evil!
Who's more evil, me or the person who told me?
You!
Yeah, but YOU'D be in trouble.
She'd never forgive you.
Excuse me.
I have to go make a mix tape.
OK, we had a little setback, but don't give up.
Forget it!
I'm sick of this!
I hate kites!
I have always hated kites!
Dad, don't freak out in front of the other kids.
I'm never gonna get this and I don't want to!
You can't give up.
I can give up, and I give up!
I'm tired of your attitude.
I'm going home.
Dewey!
Dewey, come back here.
It's too far for you to walk.
Dewey!
Dewey, stop!
Dewey!
Don't you ever run away like that again.
There's something on the back of your pants.
I'm flying a kite!
I'm flying a kite!
Lois, I did it!
I did it!
I actually flew a kite!
How could I think these were evil?
I love this kite.
Why don't you kiss it?
For God's sake!
Are you still obsessing about that?
I want a straight answer.
Lois, from the moment I laid eyes on you YOU were the only woman for me.
Unlike all other men, you don't even have a glancing interest in other women?
You alone stand outside the dictates of millions of years of evolution!
Why is that so hard for you to believe?
Because I look at other men!
Not seriously.
I would never do anything about it, but, God, hell, I notice!
And if you don't, it means that ..
it means that you love me more than I love you.
Well, honey, that's always been true.
Of course I love you more.
You're OK with that?
Oh, yeah.
If you loved me as much as I love you, we'd never leave the bedroom!
Nothing would get done.
We'd die of starvation.
I love you!
Not as much as I love you.
I have fasted, I have meditated, I got frostbite from a night in the wilderness!
I just want to know what to do.
What am I missing?
There's a wolf.
What's that?
Loyalty.
Eagle.
OK, insight insight The frog is bug-eating!
What does that have to do with anything?
Please just give me a sign or a signal, or something!
Oh, my God!
Are you the dirtbag that took my pole?
Huh?
It's my pole.
I want it back.
Oh, of course!
I'm so sorry.
I didn't take it.
I'm going crazy.
Can you tell me what it means?
Well, if I hit it, it means I'm five inches away from the back of my carport.
You use it as a wheel-stop?
This beautiful, sacred thing?
Sacred?
It's a decoration.
Like a coat of arms or a storybook.
It's a pretty chunk of wood my kids helped me carve.
But you can't tell me you can't feel the energy!
You white boys all think cos I've got dark skin, I dance with the bears and listen to the spirit of the wind.
I got news for you - I work for a living.
I'm a Baptist, and I'm proud of it.
But you sure?
And by the way, I have only one word for snow - snow!
> No!
Stop!
Malcolm!
He's not who you think he is.
Reese is only interested in you cos I told him you have big breasts.
What?
!
It just happened.
I'm sorry.
He only wants you for your boobs!
Stop saying that!
He planned all this.
I can prove it.
He wrote it all down.
This isn't it.
Where's your REAL calendar?
That IS my calendar.
All proceeds went to animal shelters.
He's using you and you fell for it!
Leave me alone!
You heard her.
But What's her name?
What?
What's her name?
I know what her name is.
And I'm not gonna dignify that with a response.
I know what her name is, and her name is Ohhh!
How could you be so creepy?
Don't you have any sense of decency towards a fellow human being?
I have feelings!
I will be treated with respect!
I will not be objectified!
I will not be humiliated!
Now kiss my shoe!
Kiss my shoe!
The private says, "But, General, I didn't touch your toast"!
Something's different about you.
Did you get a haircut?
Very stylish.
Cynthia, did you like Europe?
I did.
I forget sometimes that there's a whole world out there that's not full of prurient adolescent boys.
There are people who treat me nicely and keep their mouths shut.
I get it!
Yes?
Is Lois here?
Honey?
Oh, God, are you Lois' husband?
So who's married to the bald guy with the earring?
Donna.
I thought that was one house I didn't have to go to.
Excuse me.
Oh, I lived in your house while you were on vacation last month.
We didn't go on vacation.

# "Boss of Me" - They Might Be Giants  Hello?
Hey, Stevie.
The usual.
We're on punishment.
We had the eggs, we had the golf clubs, what d'you expect?
Whoa!
Really?
I want that thing spotless!
I want to be able to lick the bricks.
When you gonna lick the bricks?
I want you to lick the bricks.
I'll lick the bricks right now.
This is your last day of punishment.
You want one day more?
Alright, alright!
Oh!
Stevie's dad got three extra tickets to the Demolition Derby!
Cool!
That's not the best part!
We get the handicapped seats in the front!
Mom, can we go to the Demolition Derby tomorrow?
Demolition Derby?
What?
You wanna go tomorrow?
Yeah.
Why not?
Our punishment's over tonight.
Think we may have something planned for tomorrow?
The Demolition Derby.
Or could it be that tomorrow is your father's birthday?
!
Oh.
We talked about this!
Maybe Dad can come with us.
Yeah, we could get him a ticket as a present.
You're not going anywhere!
You're staying at home and we're gonna throw your father a party like we talked about!
I have something very special planned.
Like what?
It's none of your business.
It's a surprise.
I can't believe you!
You have to be forced into celebrating your father's birthday?
!
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
You don't have to yell, we can hear you just fine if you talk in a normal tone of voice.
I'm OK with the present system.
Get back to work.
I'm not OK with the present system!
How does she make me say things like that?
Oh, my God!
What is it?
Francis is coming home.
Really?
You're kidding!
No, this is his itinerary.
He gets in tomorrow.
I hope this doesn't ruin Mom's plan.
This is Mom's plan!
Why didn't she tell us?
Because it's a surprise for Dad!
And if we blow her secret, Mom is gonna kill us!
So we just need to keep our mouths shut and finish our work.
Right.
Come on, Dewey, you call this clean?
# Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you # Happy birthday, dear Dad Happy birthday to you #  "You've never seen anything like this before".
"The Demolition Derby comes to the fairground tonight at 8:00".
"Doctor Bob Edwards and his '76 station wagon".
"Aw, damn, destruction, mayhem, big cash prizes".
"Winner takes home $150"!
"..
prohibited on the third ring".
"Come if you dare"!
This is so unfair!
Dad has tonnes of birthdays, but there's only one Demolition Derby.
We never get to do anything good!
Well, at least Francis will be here.
"..
and his '76 station wagon.
Oh, damn"!
Ah!
Not bad.
Still have a little snap in my skin.
For the love of God, what did you do to me?
What do you mean?
All those situps I did, all those miles I ran every morning and this is how you repay me, by looking like hell?
!
You think I look bad?
Please!
The crow's feet, the turkey neck?
OK, a few years have gone by, there's been a little wear and tear.
Wear and tear?
!
You look like a puppet of yourself made out of cottage cheese!
What are you talking about?
Check out the pant melons!
They still do the trick.
Sure, it's magnificent.
But you won't be able to coast on that forever.
I postdate cheques to the power company all the time, why is that suddenly such a big deal?
But next month No, it was a special circumstance.
Look, can I speak with your supervisor?
No, don't put me on ho!
Damn!
Oops, lemme get those.
Oh, there's one.
Yes, I'm still holding.
Do you have to stay on the phone?
Give me a minute, they're threatening to cut off the power.
It's a 24-hour number, you can call them back.
No, I can't!
There was a time when I didn't have to ask for your attention!
What?
Yes, I'm still I wanted the supervisor!
A man likes to be noticed when he walks in a room, Lois!
Boys, would you leave the room so your father and I can talk?
No!
Excuse me?
I'm not leaving!
You guys just chase us out whenever you want without even asking us!
I'm tired of it!
Watching TV is the only thing to do in this house that's actually fun!
So you're left with two choices!
You can either fight somewhere else or get us a TV for our room!
There's no reasoning with that woman.
I thought you made some good points.
It doesn't matter, she doesn't listen.
It's like talking to a wall.
Hey, that's what we're doing.
Just relax, it's only for a couple of hours.
When Francis gets home, they'll forget all about it.
We can get through this.
We've been waiting for 20 minutes, Lois, when can we eat?
Hal, we have to wait for the ice cream to loosen up.
You know you like it soft.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
In fact, so do we.
We all do.
Since when?
Since yesterday.
What happened yesterday?
Dad, just be patient.
This isn't a witch hunt.
Just calm down, and whatever happens is gonna happen.
What are you talking about?
What I'm trying to say is we're gonna get through this together.
As a family.
And as individuals.
In this great country where we live.
Thank God!
Come on, Hal!
What?
What are you doing?
Giving you your present!
Ta-da!
Happy birthday, Dad!
Francis!
Oh, my God, it's Francis!
Oh, look at you!
Come here!
I can't believe it!
How long are you staying?
A few days.
You surprised?
Surprised?
I'm, I'm, I'm in shock!
You should be!
I've been planning this for months!
Thank you!
Happy birthday, honey.
Well, hold on, I got another surprise for you.
Oh!
Everybody, this is Piama.
She's my wife.
We're married.
Hi.
I was gonna tell you over the phone and then I thought, why not bring her down here and surprise you!
You're married?
Piama and I are husband and wife.
We got married last week.
Last week?
Francis, who is this woman?
She's my wife.
Her name is Piama.
Hello.
Well, come on, isn't anyone gonna congratulate us?
What?
For getting married.
That's what families do.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Come on, Mom, at least try and be happy!
This is a hell of a thing to dump in my lap on your father's birthday!
Yeah, it's all about you, Mom.
Excuse me for thinking my family would be excited to meet my wife!
I can't believe you guys!
Come on, Francis, it's not their fault.
What d'you expect?
You could've called ahead of time.
Boys, go to your room!
What?
We're on your side!
I said go!
How long have you known each other?
You never mentioned her.
I only met her a month ago.
Today.
Happy anniversary.
Plus we had the whole bus ride down.
A month?
I misjudged you!
That's the longest you've ever stuck with anything in your life!
Congratulations, you outlasted his paper route!
Lady, you don't want to stick your hand in my face.
Hey, everybody calm down.
We are calm!
It's Mom's who's flipping out!
Oh, Francis, I haven't even started to flip out!
Why can't you be happy?
!
We're supposed to be happy?
You behave like this, after all we've done for you?
!
I'm confused!
Are we talking about the years of psychological abuse or sending me to military school?
!
This family sucks.
They don't care about us, they don't listen to us!
Let's get outta here.
To the Demolition Derby?
No, let's really get outta here and get away from these people.
Where are we gonna go?
Wherever this takes us.
I snagged it out of Dad's wallet this morning.
You knew we'd need it?
Er, yeah.
I'm in.
Yeah, but ..
into a pulp and throw me in the trash!
Why do I even try?
You've been nothing but a problem since Let's go.
He's trying to explain it to you, if you'd listen to him for once!
Why are you talking?
Why are you talking?
!
Can we just stop this?
!
Let's get in the car and go for a drive to cool off.
We can still have a nice party.
Oh, we are long past having a nice party!
As usual, Francis has taken something that should've been sweet and ruined it!
Don't pin this on me, I'm completely willing to have a party right now!
Oh, you want to have a party?
Happy damn birthday!
Hey, why don't we all have some cake?
We don't want to be a part of this family any more, we're leaving!
Oh, great, here we go with the dramatics!
Who else wants cake?
!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Who wants some delicious damn cake?
Can Piama have a rose?
Why not?
There's plenty to go around!
I'm the one who broke the ice maker last year!
Why do you have to ruin everything?
!
Well, I learned from the best, Mom!
.
You're two clicks away from the new shape of lip colour.
Infallible colour lasts up to 16 hours, even after eating.
The conditioning balm helps lock in moisture.
Brilliant!
In ten radiant shades.
Colour that's made to stay on your lips And only on your lips.
Infallible?
It's my lip colour.
The lip duo compact that lasts up to 16 hours.
Because you're worth it.
.
Wow!
I've never been in a hotel this fancy before.
This isn't a hotel, Dewey, it's our new home.
OK, lemme do all the talking.
May I help you?
My dad called in a reservation.
OK.
There you are.
As soon as your dad signs this, you're all set.
Oh!
He's out at the car, but we can take care of it.
If you wanna have a seat, we'll just wait for your dad.
Could we speed this along?
My little brother isn't feeling very well.
Yeah.
My dad's gonna be a while.
He's cleaning up Dewey's sick.
I'm sorry, but an adult needs to sign for the room.
Look, he's really sick.
He could blow any second.
He doesn't look that sick to me.
Dewey, that was amazing!
I'm hungry.
I bet you are.
How do you guys want your steaks?
Shall we look in the park?
Nobody goes there since they put the lights in.
Oh!
Why didn't you tell us you were getting married?
It happened kinda fast.
How can you know anyone in a month?
Dad, I knew in a minute.
Trust me, Piama is the one.
She's a little fiery, but she's also kind and funny and completely real.
You just haven't gotten to know her.
And who's fault is that?
I know, but that's why I brought her, so you'd all get to know her!
It wasn't supposed to turn into the Apocalypse!
And what about you and Mom?
You got married pretty quick.
Yes, but I was a few years older, I'd already been with a lot of I had lived a full life.
So you were older.
I just ran into the right person for me a little earlier than you did.
Once you meet that person, why wait?
Huh?
Why not do it if I'm sure?
Should I not do it cos my family's not sure?
It wouldn't matter if the wedding was next week or 10 years from now, you and Mom would've had a problem with it.
All my life - I would've come, Francis.
What?
If you had invited me, I would've come.
Really?
I'm sorry.
Didn't I tell you flowers were a great idea?
OK, we're all set.
You have the Plaza burger, the main lobster, the porterhouse, large French fries and the complete dessert cart.
Your parents have an interesting taste in food.
Yeah, they do.
Actually, I'm gonna need one of your parents to sign that.
I left the tip blank, why don't you put in what you think is fair?
Bon appetit.
Dewey, your dinner's here!
There you go, Reese.
Thank you, Malcolm.
So this is what a $24 hamburger looks like.
I thought it'd be as big as my head.
Ah!
Why don't we have a jacuzzi tub at home?
Because that would make us happy.
Forget about that place.
Tonight, this is our home.
You got a lobster?
Yes.
I think I deserve a lobster.
We all deserve something nice for once.
Whoa!
This dinner was expensive.
I wonder what Dad's credit limit is?
Let's find out.
They should be home with the boys soon.
How's your tea?
Fine, thank you.
Sugar?
No, thanks.
That's a pretty bracelet.
Thank you.
What kinda stone is that?
Turquoise.
Francis got it for me.
Oh.
How was your flight?
We took the bus.
I guess that's what Francis did with the money I sent for his plane fare.
Plus the bracelet.
Let's talk about something else.
Francis isn't the screw-up you think he is.
Really?
Did you know he works and he still built a wheelchair ramp for my uncle?
In fact - I don't think we should talk about Francis.
Why not?
He's my husband and your son.
He and I have a very long and complicated history together that I don't feel like explaining to you.
Admit it, you don't like me.
I don't even know you.
Well, what would you like to know?
I'm 19, my mom ran off when I was three and my dad kicked me out when I was I've been married once before, no kids, thank God, and last year I spent three weeks in jail, but it wasn't my fault.
Will you stop this?
You can't stand for someone in your fancy family to marry beneath him.
What?
Just because I'm not all classy like you.
Classy?
You think I'm classy?
Don't laugh at me.
I'm sorry, it's just this is a first.
I hate to break it to you, but I am not classy.
Oh, yeah.
I guess what you call class, I call manners.
I came down here hoping to get along with you.
But you're not gonna let that happen.
You might be surprised at what I'd let happen.
So, ..
what's gonna happen?
I don't know.
What is gonna happen?
Good news!
The boys stole my credit card!
We just have to call the credit card company and Why don't?
Let me show you my tree house.
About time!
We called for chocolate syrup, like, 30 minutes ago!
Argh!
Hello, Malcolm.
Hi, Mom, hi, Dad.
Beat it, Vicky.
We'll finish the cuffs later.
OK, boys, get your things, we're going home.
No!
We're not going back there!
You can't stay here for ever.
What you gonna do, live under a bridge and steal food out of dumpsters?
We're not going home!
We've had it with the way you treat us and all the yelling!
You are a terrible influence on us!
All you ever do is scream!
And order us around!
Something's wrong with this family!
Families should have some way of communicating besides yelling!
OK, everybody, calm down.
I understand what you're saying, I am not gonna yell, I am not gonna scream.
We are capable of talking about this without raising our voices.
Now, boys, I want you to understand I'm sorry about what happened.
But you have to understand I get a little emotional when I learn that my oldest son was acting like an idiot and throwing his life away.
Now, that doesn't mean Stop talking about him like that!
Francis is my heart!
OK, we're even!
Everyone's fine and there's no need for escalation!
Isn't it beautiful when things work out?
It's gone pretty well, considering we got off to a rocky start.
We couldn't have asked for a better ending.
Get your wife out of my sight!
So Dad's birthday wasn't that bad after all.
He got a new back shaver, we got to eat cake cut by a knife and Mom has promised not to yell at us any more.
Bye, Francis.
Bye, Malcolm.
Happy birthday, Dad.
Thanks, son.
Piama.
Lois.
Any time you want to finish our little talk I'd like that.
Maybe I'll come for a visit.
Maybe I'll come back down here.
Any time, any place.
Er, yeah.
OK.
Bye.
Get back, you little weasel!
Reese!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's all my fault!
I'll clean my room and do all my homework!
We may wanna go back to the old system.

{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
'< I can't believe you, Dewey!
' When is she going to stop?
I'm starving.
Go get us some food.
I'm not going out there.
'Sorry doesn't cut it, young man.
' This was a good idea, just wish you had told me earlier.
I was hiding outside for 45 minutes before I came in.
I saw you.
# Yes, no, maybe # I don't know # Can you repeat the question # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now and you're not so big # You're not the boss of me now # You're not the boss of me now and you're not so big # Life is unfair # You know how you've been hounding us for years for your own computer?
We've arranged a deal with Ed to get you one.
I'm giving you my old laptop.
Is it inside that?
No, that's it.
In exchange you'll help Ed set up his new computer.
Shouldn't be hard for you to install sound and graphics cards and set up a network for my broadband connection!
You're gonna help him re-sod his lawn and build a gazebo.
What?
No!
C'mon, boys, nothing in this life comes free.
Oh, here are those Foreigner albums.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, just be glad you're getting a computer.
I should get a dog or a rat, some dumb animal that knows how to work for a living.
Yes, ma'am.
Damn idiots, never learned how to do one damn thing right in your lives.
Yes, ma'am.
The blood from my knees was tracking behind where I'd already scrubbed, so I had to keep going around until she let me put towels on my knees.
So, how was your day?
I don't care about that.
My husband was disrespected by a woman unfit to eat the crap between your toes.
Somebody ought to cut her open and strangle her with her own entrails.
I love you, too.
If you want me, I'll be under my bed.
It wasn't that bad.
It was terrible.
I hate soccer.
I stink.
My team stinks.
first five minutes of the game were.
Hey, you guys won the coin toss.
I wanna quit.
People don't just quit cos they lose a couple of games.
The coach quit.
He had an emotional breakdown, that's not the same thing.
The point is you're not quitting.
In fact, you know what?
I'm gonna coach you.
What?
!
This will be great.
It'll give us a chance to hang out together, kick the ball around.
Some day you might look back and say, "Boy, I sure had some fun with my old man".
What do you say?
No!
You're not quitting.
I am going to coach you and we are going to create treasured memories whether you want to or not.
So, what's on the ..
hard drive?
Nothing, he erased everything.
No, he deleted the programmes but he didn't format the drive.
They never do!
There it is.
Let's check out what he's got in here.
Let's go through his e-mails.
Why?
It's Ed, what's he gonna Oh, my God!
"Eddie, last night was amazing.
You touched me places my husband never knew existed".
T. Goodwin.
That's Mrs Goodwin from down the block.
That's horrible!
They're both married and fat!
Look at this one.
"Edward, just saying your name turns me to jelly".
That's Mrs Fisher.
Mrs Carmen, Mrs Wilson, Mrs Belt!
He's sleeping with half the neighbourhood.
Here's one from old Mrs Swanback.
Open the picture attachment.
Alright, kids, let's huddle up.
Hello, there.
My name is Hal.
I'm the new coach.
I don't know a lot about soccer but I do know about being a young boy and growing up can be tough!
I know what it's like to be the fat kid, the nose-picker - just wipe it on the grass, son.
But together we are more than that.
Today we're gonna be a team!
Can we just forfeit and get a burger before the line gets too long?
No.
We're going out on that field to have fun.
You kids make me sick!
If you're not puking from exhaustion, you're not playing hard enough!
It's a beautiful day.
Let's go out and enjoy the sunshine and play some soccer!
You will rip their heads off!
Do you hear me?
Stop crying.
Stop crying, you little baby!
Hey, why don't you just ease up?
They're just kids.
Hear that, men?
That's what a loser sounds like.
What do you say we go out and give it our best and have some fun?
It was 48-0 before the half, I had to call it.
Of course.
Two, four, six, eight, who did we annihilate?
The Tigers, The Tigers, we had The Tigers.
Yeah!
Hey, Stevie.
You were supposed to meet me at the library.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I actually found something decent on Ed's computer.
The Virts?
You create a virtual family, put them in different situations and the computer plays out their lives.
Is that your mom?
Not yet.
Reese.
Make sure you capture ..
the blackness of his soul.
Aggressiveness - ten.
Hygiene - zero.
OK, now me.
Appearance - nine No, ten.
A ten for intelligence.
And social skills, ten.
Too bad it doesn't go higher I have social skills, jackass!
OK, it's dinner time.
Where's Malcolm?
Looking at himself in the mirror.
How you doing?
I'm hot and I'm bored.
What is this stuff?
It smells awful.
What are you doing?
There's bare patches all over the place.
Are you paying attention to what you're doing?
I get grounded plenty, Ed, I know grunt work.
Why don't you go fix Mrs Collins's garage door and get off my back?
!
What did you say?
You heard me.
Oh, my God, what do you know?
Formulate your megabytes next time you get rid of your computer.
Oh, and by the way, Mrs Swanback?
!
You are sick!
Keep your voice down.
Look, it's not my fault.
I try to be faithful but the women on this block are just so desperate and lonely.
It's like I cast some kind of spell.
I try to tell 'em no, but it always leads to a back rub.
I know, Ed, I read all about it.
Is that you, Ed?
Ah, I'm a little busy right now, Martha.
Look, you can't tell my wife.
You can't tell anyone, please.
I'll do anything.
I'll do anything you ask.
I can work with that.
Damn, don't they know someone's got to clean up their caribou carcases?
These antlers won't fit down the disposal.
Francis, come away from there.
You don't have to do that.
You're much too valuable to mess with that.
Yesterday you said you'd seen tumours with hair smarter than me.
Can't you tell good-natured ribbing?
I've got an important job for you.
Sit there and check the reception on the TV - it's been spotty lately.
Oh, and make sure these sodas haven't gone flat.
That sounds do-able.
We've got other people to do the grunt work.
A newlywed shouldn't be tiring himself out before he even gets home.
Your lovely, young wife wouldn't like that, would she?
What did you do?
!
I don't know what you're talking about, honey.
Lavernia is treating me like a human being.
What did you do to her?
Maybe she turned over a new leaf.
Sometimes really big crappy jerks just realise they've got to change.
She was terrified.
I don't know how you did it but you must have said something.
I wouldn't do that, Francis.
I'm not gonna fight your battles for you.
Obviously that's not true.
Now, damn it, tell me what you did.
You know what, I don't have to do anything you tell me to do, and you might want to reconsider your tone of voice.
Sometimes you make me so mad!
Alright, look, today's practise was Well, let's focus on the positive.
I think it's encouraging that so many of you found the right field.
Special congratulations go to Billy for using the sidestep to run away from the butterfly that almost landed near him.
But we do need to work on your general unwillingness to kick the ball.
It hurts!
Boys, if we are going to get better, we have to work together.
We have to start acting like a team.
You know what it means to be on a team, don't you?
Well, don't C'mon!
Think of a team.
Like the X-Men?
Yes!
Yes, like the X-Men.
You boys are like the X-Men.
And what do the X-Men do?
Fight evil?
Yes, they work together to fight evil and also to uphold the ideals of good sportsmanship and team work!
And fight evil!
Yes!
OK, OK.
Boys, c'mon, huddle up, huddle up.
I should not be telling you this but the American Youth Soccer Federation has been infiltrated by evil forces hellbent on domination of the Earth.
The infiltration goes all the way down to the lowest levels - I'm talking The Black Hawks, The Bulldogs, The Eagles.
Every other team in our league has been lost to the forces of evil and it's up to you boys to stop them.
Now, boys, what do you say?
Who wants to be on the side of goodness and who wants to rid the world of EVIL?
Alright, boys, let's get out there and do some kickey drill.
.
It's important to protect your teeth from the build-up of invisible plaque.
But how do you fight something that's invisible?
Simple.
Orbit Complete with xylitol helps protect teeth from plaque.
Can you please ..
start working?
Just one more second.
This is interesting.
I made my mom quit her job and go to Law School.
It's less money but her happiness went way up.
I made Dad quit too.
He's working on neighbours' cars.
Check out this.
I still think they could be happier.
Let's send Reese to China.
What are you changing ..
about Malcolm?
Nothing, he's fine.
He's burning ..
himself with a cigarette.
Just a phase.
"" Where were you?
I've been waiting for that lotion.
Look, a freckle.
My wife gets back soon.
It'll be hard explaining why I'm catering to a 15 year old.
I'll explain if you want me to.
It's OK, forget it.
Fly.
Where?
Just a drill.
"" Well, the oak seems to burn a few degrees hotter than the maple.
Oh, this game is asinine!
I thought you liked it.
It's this idiotic programming!
My family has turned out horrible!
My mom became a Supreme Court Justice, Reese is the King of China and Dad is a millionaire from his auto-body shops.
Why is Malcolm sneaking Scotch from the toilet tank?
He won't stop!
It's his second bottle since breakfast.
I am so done with this game.
No, I'm moving them all to Arkansas to become chicken farmers.
That ought to level out the playing field.
Hi, honey.
This is great, you're home early.
You don't come home so mad any more.
I think we may have to split up.
What?
I'm not sure this is working.
I love you but I don't know you that well.
Hell, I can't pronounce your last name.
Ta-nana-ha-akna.
This Lavernia thing, I think there's a side - I don't understand.
If someone does something for someone they love and it solves the problem - No!
Marriage is about trust and communication and not being terrified!
We're supposed to be a team, I thought.
Look, I'm going to ask you one last time, for the sake of our marriage, what did you do?
What?
I took her parakeet!
You stole the woman's pet?
The woman's pet!
You protect the people you love.
I figured you would.
I'd tell you if I was gonna grab a parakeet and hold it hostage I wouldn't do that.
How long were you going to keep it for, anyway?
'Til she behaved and if she didn't, I guess I'd have killed it.
See?
!
That's where it gets alarming again.
Putting aside the horrible nature of the act, what's upsetting is, you made this unilateral decision - I said I'm sorry!
How many times do you want me to say it?
You didn't!
You were going to break up with me!
You think that makes me feel safe?
You're right, I'm sorry.
Wait!
No, I'm not apologising here!
Bring that bird back.
If I do it, she'll think I was involved.
You made this mess without me, you clean it up without me.
Or what?
Or maybe I'll do it for you!
And you have dinner ready when I get back!
Ed, school gets out at 3.
It's 2.15!
I've been waiting for over an hour!
Sorry, Reese.
Excuse me.
> Damn, hurry up.
Hello, I'm Mrs Abbott, Reese's guidance counsellor.
I've been trying to talk to you about your son for weeks!
Well, I'm here now.
What can I do for you?
You have to stop this.
Stupid game.
This is ridiculous!
Everybody in my family is perfect.
Mom is President, Reese is married to six supermodels, Dad's funding a search for extraterrestrials.
Nothing I do has any effect.
If I give them money, take it away, make them ugly or Canadian, everything works out beautifully for them and horrible for me.
Dewey ..
just became Pope.
And I weigh 500 pounds.
That's it, I'm just going to have to kill them.
Go to counter.
Get knife.
Kill them.
No, don't make yourself a sandwich.
Kill!
Kill!
No, not yourself.
Don't kill, don't kill.
Uuurrgh!
This means nothing!
So, Dad, are you gonna ground me Boy, your counsellor was furious.
So, we head back to your place, set up your Jacuzzi then throw something on the barbecue for me.
I've got a better idea.
I'll get in my Jacuzzi and you fix my dinner.
What?
With the information I just got, I can call your mother and you won't see daylight for years.
Oh, yeah?
One word and I'm telling your wife your little secret.
The question is - am I more scared of my wife or are you more scared of your mother?
Then get a dozen peach roses - they've got to be peach - and run them over to Mrs Malone's.
Lavernia, I'm sorry.
I just talked to my wife.
This was all a big misunderstanding.
She's sorry, too, and we just want you to have I guess I should have put a blanket on this on the way over.
I just want you to know that I  OK, boys, we have come a long way and today is the day we show what we're made of.
Now, who are we?
The forces of good!
And who's evil?
The Gophers!
We've got a schedule change, coach.
The Gophers didn't show up.
You're playing the Black Hawks.
Don't worry, I'll call it before it gets ugly.
We're playing the Black Hawks again?
!
You're forgetting your mission.
You're here to fight evil and they are the most evil of all.
When the teacher remembers to give you homework right before you leave school, the Black Hawks are behind it.
When your mother says, "You can't watch TV," the Black Hawks told her to say that.
All those Christmas presents you wanted.
Do you know who got them?
The Black Hawks.
If it were up to them, we wouldn't have Christmas!
I, for one, am glad we have the chance to fight for what is right and good!
Now, I ask you boys, who are we going to beat?
!
The Black Hawks!
And what are they?
Evil!
Yeah!
Teams, take the field.
I love you, boys.
I've done all the coaching I can do.
The rest is up to them.
Aaghhh!
Eat chalk, evil-doer!
Oh, my God!
No, we couldn't stop them if we wanted to.
You just left the truck and ran all the way home?
You didn't see the look on her face.
I'm scared going to work tomorrow.
You know, she does have a turtle.

Hey, what are we watching?
A documentary on eye surgery.
They are reattaching a retina.
"The procedure involves making small incisions into the wall of the eye to allow instruments into the cavity".
Is there anything else on?
Dad, this is interesting.
I might be a doctor someday.
You're right.
"The draining of the vitreous - the clear gel-like fluid that fills the back of the eye" Aah-aah!
I'm gonna go read.

You boys are late!
I want you outta this house in 30 seconds!
We've got time.
When we're really late, our lunches are on the front lawn.
Mom, Reese - Go, go.
Go, go!
OK, I'm doing dry-cleaner, mechanic and post office, you're doing groceries.
Right.
Got the cable bill?
Great.
Bye, guy.
Did I just say, "Bye guy," to you?
I'm pretty sure you did.
Guy?
I - I - I called you guy?
!
How can that happen?
!
I've never done that before!
It's a lapse.
Guy?
!
Hal, it happens.
Let's get one thing clear.
In no way, shape or form do I think of you as a guy.
You are a gorgeous, exciting, feminine goddess that I still don't know what I've done to deserve.
Do you understand that?
Yes.
Let's do this walking.
OK, just for argument's sake, let's say Doctor Bombay was one of the M*A*S*H surgeons.
I'd still want Hawkeye operating on a perforated aorta!
It's experience that counts.
Will you hurry up with those dishes, my bubbles are evaporating!
Eric, you're not gonna believe this.
I swear I just saw Commandant Spangler standing outside the window.
That's not even funny, Francis.
Some things you don't joke about, like that hook-handed maniac!
But he was so real!
It was like being back at military school!
For a long time I saw him every time I shut my eyes.
We escaped from that hellhole.
We made it out and found better lives for ourselves.
Now let's get these dishes done.
We still have to snake out the toilets.
Hey, guys, wait up!
Hi, I'm Dewey.
You smell terrible.
I like you.
Maybe you could come home with me.
You're not allowed a dog.
We want you to be miserable.
That's right, son.
It's our job to make sure we're as unfair as possible to you.
Don't listen to them, Dewey.
I've studied the matter thoroughly and I'm convinced you can get away with it.
All you have to do is hide me.
Hm!
I'll call you Marshmallow.
# "Tonight's The Night " - Rod Stewart "# Tonight's the night # It's gonna be alright # Cos I love you, girl Ain't nobody gonna # stop us now #" Hal, what are you doing here?
!
Well, you're off work in five minutes and I am here to whisk you away for a night of romance.
Oh, honey, that's so sweet but I can't.
I've gotta cover for Craig tonight.
Why?
!
Oh, he's sick as a dog!
He's the biggest faker in the world!
The last time he was out with the flu we saw him jumping up and down in the window on the Today Show!
But I was sick.
You didn't tape that, did you?
I set my timer wrong.
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry!
After all the trouble you went through.
No, it's no big deal.
Really, it wasn't any trouble.
Thanks again for the ride home.
Wow.
So this is what it woulda been like to go to my prom.
All I wanted was a nice evening.
I even dug up the wedding vows I never was able to read to her.
What happened?
She went into labour with Francis in the middle of the ceremony.
I was gonna read them to her tonight.
God, now I feel awful.
Don't worry about it, Craig.
It's not your fault.
No, I really feel awful.
Bleurgh!
Honey, I'm so sorry about tonight.
Listen, tomorrow night I'm gonna fix us such a special dinner.
We'll lock the boys in the garage, open a bottle of wine  Oh, I know, honey.
I know.
Is the roast medium rare?
Did you put the wine in the fridge?
My roast is perfect.
I never knew we had fancy silverware.
When was the last time you used this?
The night you were conceived.
Want more details?
No!
Good.
Thank you for your help!
Now get in your room and don't make a peep.
Move!
He's not a dog!
He's just pretend!
What's for dinner?
A dog?
!
Busted!
Please, don't tell Mom!
Please!
Do you have a death wish?
Just let me have him one night!
Please, please!
OK, Dewey, relax.
We won't tell.
Thank you!
So when do we tell?
As soon as Dad gets home.
It'll be funnier.
I couldn't sleep at all last night.
Me, too.
It's like there's something creepy in the air.
< Francis!
Commandant Spangler!
What are you doing in Alaska?
I've come for YOU, Francis.
I've been searching for you for months.
Me?
Why?
Why?
Because ..
after 32 years as an educator and disciplinarian, your DESERTION stood out as my only failure.
A FAILURE that haunted my every waking moment.
I began to see YOUR FACE in those of other young cadets who didn't deserve the wrath that I poured down on their innocent souls.
There was a lawsuit.
Charges were filed.
Disgrace.
I can't even remember the fire but I do remember the CAUSE!
Through all of my suffering ..
I saw the STUPID grinning face of the one person responsible for all of my suffering!
Who?
Die!
Die!
Die!
Sir, cut it out, your hooks are cold.
"" And then Dewey and Marshmallow killed the evil dragon, rescued the poor little princess and flew all the way back home.
And they got medals and big red capes and everybody loved them.
Are you OK?
Marshmallow!
Whoa!
Marshmallow, stop!
> Boys, I told you to stay in your room!
I don't understand it!
An entire roast?
!
With your bare hands?
!
The salad, the potatoes, the green beans!
What do you have to say for yourself?
!
I was hungry.
An entire stick of butter?
!
Wait a second.
How could you eat a candle?
I like candles.
I think they're good.
That's it!
You are going to the hospital and getting your stomach pumped!
Alright, young man, I think you're empty.
Well?
He's fine.
We didn't find any candles but we did find some marbles and the waistband to a pair of underpants.
Don't ask.
Thank you, Doctor.
Alright, Dewey, this is the end.
You and your brothers are now officially in the red zone.
But - Red zone, mister!
Tomorrow night I am taking your mother out on an emergency date.
It will be a beautiful, romantic evening that we need very badly and nothing is going to derail it on penalty of death!
Good.
Do you want your army man?
OK.
So, how's he doin'?
I was up with him all night.
He got pretty wild but I think he's doin' better now.
I wanna die!
Why can't I just die?
!
Stop talking like that, sir.
This is just a momentary setback.
I have nothing to live for.
Mother no longer acknowledges me.
I have no friends, no money.
I won't even tell you how I paid for my journey up here.
If it means anything to you, sir, you taught me how to be a man.
I have no idea who you are.
You don't remember me?
After the hell that you put me through, you don't even remember me?
Cadet Dudley?
No, Eric!
I just spent the last ten hours cradling you!
Sir, this is because you're not feeling useful.
Look, I think I may have found you a job.
A what?
It'd be with the Interior Department helping the environment.
You would be making a real difference.
I can do that.
Thank you, son.
And, please, thank that girl for rocking me in her arms all night long.
Bleurgh!
Alright, who's ready for a fantastic night on the town?
Oh, Hal!
They're beautiful!
Just give me two minutes to freshen up and I'll be ready to roll!
Just stay put, Dewey.
You're doing great.
We've been in here for three hours!
Hey, I'm just looking out for your best interests.
Dad just came home.
Let's tell 'em now so it ruins their date.
Or we can wait till they come home and they might be drunk.
True.
Alright, boys, your father and I are leaving now.
I've left you the number for the restaurant.
If we get a call, it better be from the coroner.
Nothing is gonna ruin this night!
My lady, your carriage awaits.
Well, I'm outta here.
Back at ten?
Sounds good.
Dewey, you and your dopey dog are on your own for an hour or two!
Nope.
Why?
Did something happen to the dog?
Oh, he's fine.
He's just busy destroying your comic books.
What?
!
That's it!
You're getting rid of that thing right now!
And you're gonna pay for this!
I don't think so.
Oh, I think so!
Sit.
I wasn't talking to him.
Ever since the day I was born you guys have been torturing me.
I remember you trying to switch me for another baby at the park.
I remember you telling me the tooth fairy was a vampire.
I remember every booger sandwich, every stink hat, Dewey, we're sorry!
..
every waffle butt, every Chester Backster and every purple nurple!
And now you're going to pay.
Dewey, this isn't gonna work.
Mom and Dad'll be home soon, that dog will be gone, you'll be in trouble and we'll kick your ass for ten years!
I know.
So we'd better get started.
What do you want?
Everything.
I want everything.
Hal, this place is beautiful!
It's so romantic!
Everything is fabulous!
Yes, it is fabulous.
They have your favourite - oysters!
We'll have to order those.
Actually, I had a big batch of oysters for lunch.
You did?
Where did you get oysters?
A guy has a cart outside the building.
Besides, I am dying to try this plain broth.
They're famous for it.
For their broth?
Is that your friend from work?
Who?
That fat old man?
Never mind.
I'm just so excited to be here.
Excuse me.
I love this!
I'm having such a great time.
Me, too.
Excuse me.
Hurry back.
Oh, excuse me, I need your help!
Here, here's $20.
Go and buy me some medicine, some cold medicine, and serve it to me in a champagne glass.
But I - Just stop talking and go!
Pencils down.
Who wants to read their essay first?
Marshmallow, why don't you choose?
"50 reasons why Dewey is the greatest brother in the history of the universe and I'm a worthless junk of garbage".
Is that what we were supposed to be writing about?
!
From the top.
"50 reasons why Dewey is the greatest brother -" Stop!
Something's not right.
Wait!
There.
Continue.
Nobody move.
Hello!
I know someone's home!
I saw shapes moving on the curtains!
Marshmallow, guard!
Is your dad home?
No.
They went to a restaurant but they said you should go over - I came to drop off some pants.
They got - Craig, help!
Help us, please!
Dewey's gone crazy!
He's holding us prisoner!
I'm sorry you had to see this.
"Number 12, his twinkling eyes".
To us.
To us.
You know, Lois 'Don't pass out!
No, no, keep it together!
' 'Smile, smile!
Laugh!
'  'You're going to throw up.
' 'OK, if it comes to it, aim for the ice bucket!
'  # We're stinky and evil, we're dumb and sarcastic # While Dewey, in contrast, is super fantastic # That's why Dewey is king # Why Dewey is king # Hey, it's haircut time!
Think of your favourite stooge and I'll be right back.
Marshmallow, if anyone moves, eat them.
This is insane.
We've got to do something.
I'm Mo.
We don't have a choice.
On the count of three, we'll split up and all run for different doors.
He might get one of us.
Yeah, but two of us will get away and get help.
I'm willing if you are, I can't sing any more.
Ready?
On three.
One, two, three!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Good dog!
No, no!
Aaaaaaargh!
Craig's a good guy.
He always comes through for us.
I couldn't find any rusty scissors, so we're gonna have to use - Where is he?
He should've been back by now.
Look, my palms are sweating!
Would you calm down?
Here he comes.
So?
For some reason, I was fired.
I don't believe it, he's drunk again!
Face it, Francis, there's no hope for this guy.
The only thing that ever made him happy was bullying helpless students.
Without that he's nothing.
You call that a collage?
It is an insult to the craft!
I can see paste coming up over the top of the Popsicle stick!
Sorry, I have arthritis.
That's it.
You have just lost pudding for the whole group.
Feel free to thank Mrs Meekitjuk after I leave.
I feel like dancing.
Me, too.
Darling, there's something I've wanted to say to you for the longest time.
Uh-huh?
I have to go to the hospital.
Oh, Hal, you don't know how happy that makes me!
What do you think, one more can?
No, we don't wanna spoil him.
Besides, he probably has to go to the bathroom now.
Who wants to go out in the front yard?
I'll remember this, too.
"And how can words describe how I feel on this, the day of our marriage"?
"You are my day, my night, the sun in my sky".
"You are the Duran to my Duran".
Oh, Hal!
"Her name is Lois and she dances on the sand, just like that river twisting through a dusty land".
My dentist told me that most adults will, at some point, have some form of gum problem.
And he said healthy gums are critical for healthy teeth.
So I decided to use Colgate Total.

Good night, honey.
Good night.
Oh, honey, please not tonight, it's freezing.
# Yes, no, maybe # I don't know # Can you repeat the question # You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # Life is unfair # What do you think, more salt, more cilantro, a little zing of Tabasco?

Chips - potato, corn, blue corn, sour cream and onion, salt and vinegar, Kettle.
Bait.
Is this why I didn't get a birthday present?
This is my first time hosting the poker game.
I want everything perfect - at least better than their stuff.
Oh, do you know Brian's daughter, Chandra?
Yeah!
Of course.
Brian's bringing her and a friend.
Kristen?
Ah, yes, something, but Brian is playing poker so I need you two to entertain them.
Don't bother us.
I want you and those girls in your room, all night, got it?
There's your birthday present.
Who's Chandra?
She's no-one to you, understood?
Set one foot in our room tonight - you're dead.
Where am I supposed to go?
I don't care but if I see you tonight, I'll charley horse every muscle in your body.
But Ow!
It disturbs me how much I enjoyed that.
Don't make me do it again.
Hi, honey.
Hello.
You're working late?
Yeah, 10.30.
Good, something came up.
I've got to have dinner with someone.
Who?
No-one.
It's just some old business, I don't want to talk about it, OK?
Can I help?
No.
I promise, I'll tell you everything when you get home.
OK.
Thanks.
He'll be gone by the time you get back.
Did you catch that "he" part?
Hey, Brian, how are you?
They're here, get out.
Boys, I know you know Brian and you kids know each other.
Yeah!
No.
Anyway, entertain yourselves.
Your father and I have to conduct some business.
He has some of my money in his wallet.
Bring it on!
May I take your wrap?
Just cos Dad dragged us to this dump doesn't mean we have to talk to you.
Show us where we can sit where we won't catch fleas.
I'm going to see what Dewey's doing.
Hey.
You're Stevie, right?
Can we help you in?
I'm not deaf.
Did you hear him breathe?
Ah.
Ah.
Did you hear the one about the astronaut and the hooker?
Yeah, I didn't get it.
Dewey, I told you to stay in your room.
But Reese said - This is man time, you can't be here.
How's the dip?
This is a sweet table.
What is it?
A 52-incher?
Yes, sirree!
Nice, I've got the 54.
But you don't have my built-in drink holders.
Or my extra padded leather around the edges.
You can play all night and not feel it in your wrist.
This is nice, too.
How do you live with only three keys, I've got five.
I've got nine.
Guys, guys, guys, do we have to do this every week?
You're right.
So, er, how's the kids?
You're just asking so you can talk about yours.
Why shouldn't I?
James has made captain of the wrestling team.
Stevie wrote a brand new program.
My daughter's essay won a trip to the White House.
Malcolm has an IQ of 165.
We know, you've been using that for six months.
Would you like something from the kitchen?
No, ..
thank you.
He doesn't want anything.
Do you think they'll offer to change his diapers?
I can't believe Stevie's putting up with this.
I'll take care of it.
Let me explain something.
Stevie's no different than the rest of us.
He plays video games, he does chores around the house, he goes to the movies with friends.
He leads a completely normal life.
It's sad that he only has two months to live.
What?
Stevie, they have a right to know.
Oh, my God, is it true?
I've been told ..
I'm very brave.
Aw!
So Malik wins the breath-holding.
Abe got the most dip on a chip.
Trey has the longest neck.
Steve has the highest socks and Hal, well, Hal has nothing, so far.
The doctors are baffled.
Stevie's brain is too big for his head.
It's pressing up against his skull.
He only has two months before it explodes.
It's called encephalo neurop er, litis.
How horrible!
What do you think you're doing?
Helping Stevie.
It's weird but it feels good.
I like being the hero.
You're pimping a fatal disease to take advantage of a girl!
For good.
Stevie, this is so unfair.
I have no regrets.
Well, one.
Old business, what do you think that means?
I dunno.
An old boyfriend?
I have no idea.
Those old relationships can really get a hold on you.
What's up with her ex-husband?
He's still in jail.
Didn't his parole just come up?
I dunno, maybe.
She'll tell me about it tonight.
Man, I really admire your maturity.
Thank you.
I'm the opposite, I over-analyse everything - like how Piama didn't kiss you goodbye, or her ex-husband being locked up without a woman for five years.
That's what's wrong with me, one suspicious conversation and I'm picturing sweaty bodies rolling around in front of a fire.
God, I've got a lot of growing up to do.
What are you doing here?
You've kicked me out of my room.
I've nowhere to go.
Not my problem.
I don't want to hear you cry, it's a real mood killer.
Thanks, this light's much better for his eyes.
The music helps regulate my heartbeat.
I've got to call his vitals in to the doctor.

What are you doing with a gun?
Give it back.
No!
You don't bring a gun into this house.

This is where my family lives.
You don't even know them.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Tell me where it is.
No way.
It's not mine, it's my boyfriend's.
His parents search his room.
Well, they should, he's got a gun.
Tell me where it is.
No.
It's not even mine.
Ooh!
Do you have anything in this house that isn't junk?
No.
Oh, damn!
Ahh!
Who can stuff the most pretzels in their mouth?
OK, who can throw a potato chip the farthest?

Hey, hats off to you, man.
Now we know why you're bad at poker.
How do you keep your eyes open?
Watch out, she must be angling for something big.
What are you talking about?
You don't get anything free with women.
With that attitude it's no wonder you're not doing any better.
Oh!
Don't put that on me, pal.
Can we?
When was the last time you sent your wife flowers?
How come it's the man that has to send flowers?
I would love flowers.
Might as well stretch, this is gonna take a while.
Women are independent beings who can make their own ..
choices.
Look at any successful relationship, you'll find one common element - trust!
Fine, but I didn't need the hour-and-20-minute speech.
I was going to ask if you wanted to take off early, but evidently you're not concerned so I -   Do you like this?
Yeah.
Do you know something, Stevie?
Maybe it was meant for me to be here with you.
Wasn't it fate that made Dawson's Creek a rerun so I came here?
I guess fate ..
can be kind, too.
Oh, this is so awful!
Stop It's OK.
No, it's not OK.
I keep thinking about everything you're gonna miss out on.
You're never going to grow up.
You're never gonna go to your prom.
I mean, you're never gonna know what it's like to be loved.
What I'm thinking about doing goes against everything I believe in, but, then, I don't even know what I believe in any more.
It's, like, what kind of a God could just let you die like this?
I'll ask ..
when I see him.
When was the last time you just made time to talk to her?
You're perfectly happy not sharing your feelings.
Just get off my back!
There it is, you're shutting me out.
Just talk to me!
So you can twist my words and throw them back at me?
How many times do I have to apologise for that?
'You've been drinking.
' I warned you.
My boyfriend's coming over.
He's gonna get that gun from you.
Oh, little Marky's gonna come over and scare me I broke up with Marky, I'm dating Derek Fowler.
Derek Fowler?
He's a psycho!
What happened to Marky?
You guys were great together.
Derek's gonna make you tell him.
Where are you going?
I don't wanna be here when he shows up.
Chandra, I'm going home.
Sayonara!
Well, maybe I'll just call the cops.
Let's hope they get here first.
That's it, I've had it.
You guys broke all my stuff.
Look, I don't want you to ruin this.
This is all I have left.
There, now you've got nothing to worry about.
End of discussion.
Oh, my God, how can a night that's turned out so badly get even worse?
Wait, don't panic.
Think for a second.
No, this is good, this is sensible.
I make those kinds of statements and just assume she knows I'm sorry.
And you know what, that's not right, she deserves better than that.
That's all I needed to hear.
I'm gonna tell her how much I love her.
Let's go, man.
Yeah.
Go.
Hello Earl, is that you?
What the hell are you doing at my house?
Hello?

Ok, take care.
Talk to you tomorrow.
Catch you later.
Call you Well, I guess the game's over.
Yeah.
You know, I wondered why Earl never came to the game.
Dad, I've tried to be understanding about all this but there is a limit.
You have a right to know what's going on.

Abe, are you OK?
I think so.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
Everyone OK?
I mean, what was that?
Face it, Dad, you are a crappy father.
All you ever cared about was women, drinking and stealing.
You know what?
I can't talk about this any more.
How many times do I have to say it?
I need money.
Guess who's home?
What are you doing here?
I got off early.
Hello, I'm Francis, Piama's husband.
You're married?
Didn't think that was worth mentioning?
Francis, I told you Hey, I had a life before I met you.
Maybe I haven't been fair to you, our relationship wasn't all bad.
Remember all the tickle fights?
Yeah, those were wild.
One time we were taking a bath and she started squirming so - Aghhh!
I don't want to hear this.
C'mon, it's a funny story, Francis, and he loves telling it, don't you, Dad?
Dad?
Yeah.
I just Oh, er I'm so sorry.
I just I mean, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Do you have any money?
No.

I'm gonna go finish off my shift.

Let's start with you.
Well, ..
it's like ..
this.
You found the gun, didn't tell your father, handled it, hid it inside the house, handled it again to move it, tried to destroy it with a hacksaw, and at no point did you contact the police until after the gun went off?
Yes.
What did you say your IQ was?
Man, what a night.
Yeah.
I couldn't believe how scared I was.
You were scared?
!
I was way more scared than you guys.
I screamed like a little girl.
I could have broke glass the way I screamed.
You sounded like a hero compared to how I screamed.

We need professional help.
Hello.
Thanks for squeezing us in.
Why do we all have to be here?

He doesn't walk in his sleep and pee on the TV.
My wife told you about the car?
Yes, the joyriding incident.

We are at our wits' end.
I authorise you to do whatever it takes.

Take a seat.
So, let's go over the ground rules.
This is a safe zone.
And what that means is when one of you talks, everybody listens.
And listening does not include interrupting, name-calling, or passing judgment on what was said.
Everybody can say what they want, and feel OK about it.
Can I have a piece of candy?
No.
This is ridiculous!
We didn't take their car!
We were watching TV.
We were good.
I had stuff scheduled for later, but - A lot of damage was done to the car.
Somebody else must have driven it.
OK, let's back up.
Let's talk about the home.
There's a leak in the roof over my bed.
No, about your family life.

You wanna frisk me?
You just consider yourselves lucky.

You're obviously a very bright young man.
Would you like to spend the hour telling me how bright you are?

Now, if you had to describe them in a few words, how would you do that?
I don't know.

I can't tell you.
Yes or no.
No questions asked.
'Oh, my God!
' Make it ten.
Done.
OH, MY GOD!
Good son.
I got him, honey.
I got him, don't worry!
You have another brother, Francis?
Did I tell you what they did to him?
Classic first-born scenario - a free-and-easy couple has a kid and their world's turned upside down.
Even after other kids, the oldest one is a symbol for everything wrong in their lives, through no fault of his.
Dad, I know what you're gonna say, and believe me, I totally agree.
There is no excuse for what I did.
It was idiotic, immature, totally reckless, and I'm really sorry.
I'm just hoping against hope, you will give me another chance, which I admit, I don't deserve.
But if you could just find it in your heart to forgive me, I know I could earn your trust back.
They had it out for him from the start.
You kids have a lot of issues with your parents.
Do you ever discuss any of this with them?
You never tell your parents your feelings?
We try.
I put newspapers in the blender and set it on fire as a cry for help.
I mean talk, with words, you know, talk about the subject at hand.
You know, a lot of families do that, er, round the dinner table.
That can be a really good environment to share your feelings.
Great pancakes, Dad Oh, thanks!

I am.
Here are the house rules - you can't reach for seconds until you're finished.

Stop playing with your food.
Oh, Mom!
Don't you dare.
Relax.
I wasn't really going to.
Then, don't.
I wasn't going to.
Then, don't.
Don't accuse me of something I wasn't going to do.

Are you gonna throw that at Mom?
I wasn't going to.
Jeez, Louise.
I can handle this.
Reese, I'm warning you.
I wasn't going to.
But if you think I would, I should.
He's panicking.
Just put the spoon down and apologise.
OK, she gave him an out.
What?
I wasn't gonna do anything!
Just stop talking and let me think!
Dad, do something.
I got it.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm being cute and spontaneous?
Splat!
Don't do it.
I wasn't going to!
Well, I got this far in life without anyone believing me.
Why should anything be different now?

Here's what you boys need to know.
You cannot break me.
I worked in prisons!
I had a 17-year-old serial killer hugging my knees and crying like a little girl.
Those aren't Fisher Price diplomas - I went to Harvard.
I had a starring role in The Mikado!
This is nothing.
Mom makes us do this in the rain.
OK, you can relax.
Try this.
If you picked one thing about how your parents treat you, what would you change?
The biggest problem is that they don't trust us.
They assume if they leave us alone, we'll get in trouble.
Nine days past expiration.
Urgh!
Expired two months ago.
You don't have the guts.
Bleurgh!
When was the last Christmas we had eggnog?
I think before Dewey.
It's all you, man.
Bottom of the ninth.
Two outs.
Man on first.
The wind up The pitch Uh-oh.
Oh, man, we are so dead!
That's it.
Game over!
Yeah.
So I win.
What?
Past the lamp is a home run.
Two men score.
That was a foul ball!
Are you crazy?
It was down the line!
It was foul!
Shut up!
You're home plate, you don't vote.
Do over.
Fine by me.
Oh, crap!
Now we really have to quit.
Yeah.
But that was a triple.
Get back up.
Let me ask you - how do you see yourselves?
Reese, what do you think your role in the family is?
I guess I'm the bad boy.
The one that ruins everything.
Every family has that guy.
He makes you cry, makes you hate coming home at the end of the day knowing I'm gonna be there.
It's a lot of work.
But I guess it's pretty satisfying.
What are you looking at, monkey-boy?
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Reese!
What are you doing?
Help, ow, help!
Mom, help!
Ow, ow!
Cut it out!
Help, it hurts!
Ow!
Knock it off, you little - Reese!
What the heck are you doing?
God, you can't leave him for five minutes without picking on him!
I didn't do anything!
No!
What you looking at?
Reese's report card.
Much better than last time.
Really?
He used the same brand of pen as the teacher to change his grade!
Look!
He gave himself a C in Math instead of an A-plus.
Yeah.
Subtle.
Nice attention to detail.
He's really learning.
Two months grounded?
Three, scrubbing toilets.
And how do you see your place in this family?
Er, I'm the favourite.
The one everybody loves the most.
The cute one.
The one everybody looks out for and gives presents to, sometimes even make the birds sing to me, and the clouds spell my name.
Come on!
You said I could play!
You have to go down there again.
No!
You're the only one that'll fit.
No, I always go get it, and you never let me play.
We'll let you play.
We promise.
Come on!
Throw here!
You promised!
No way!
Agh!
What, can't sleep?
No, I have this terrible feeling we've forgotten something.
Trash, locks, lights Oh, well, whatever it is, I'm sure it can wait till the morning.
Oh, my Alright, son.
Son, I think you've learned your lesson.
OK.
Thanks, Dad.
Gotta stop doing this.
Hup!
Aaaarrrrggghhhh!
Agh!
I try not to throw it in their faces but sometimes I can't help it.
What about you, Malcolm?
What's your place in the family?
I dunno, I'm the middle one.
Think.
How do you fit in with this family?
Well, I Go ahead.
Well, I guess I ..
don't.
I don't fit in.
I mean, honestly, sometimes I feel I've been dropped into this family from outer space.
Well, that's interesting.
Now, how - He's the one that fixes everything.
What?
Yeah, he figures everything out and solves a lot of our problems.
Yeah, kinda like that gay kid with the scarf in Scooby Doo.
The leader.
You guys think that?
Sure, they do.
I mean, it's pretty obvious that you're the ringleader.
What?
It happens all the time.
An intelligent, sensitive kid with poor impulse control, surrounded by people who don't challenge you mentally.
You get bored and look for trouble.
I don't!
Isn't that what happened last night?
You were sitting with your brothers, nothing to do but watch TV, thinking the way to end the crushing boredom was to stir up excitement?
He didn't do it!
None of us did!
There's a lot of options for you.
There's placement programmes, camps, special schools - You wanna send me away?
You can't do that!
He's our brother!
I merely suggested - I'm not going!
You can't make him!
We're good kids!
"" Agh!
Aargh!
Oh!
Argh!
Aarrgh!
Aaarghhh!
Oooh!
Al!
I'm late for work!
Aarghh!
Don't do this!
You can't leave me alone with Reese!
We're out of time.
What is the deal with this door?
Is there some kind of baffling built into it?
You have three very special boys here.
I'd like to sit with you and your wife - Dad, he wants to send - Malcolm, let me talk to the doctor.
Maybe we ought to speak privately.
Sure.
Boys, go wait in the car.
'What the hell - ?
!
' 'Everyone alright?
' What!
That's my car!
I know I set the brake!
See!
Just like the other night.
We didn't take it out.
It just rolled out by itself!
You boys were actually telling us the truth?
You're a genius!
Boys, let's go get you some ice cream, huh?
Listen, there's a lot we haven't - Oh, absolutely!
Doc, I have no idea how you did it.
In just an hour!
I'm putting in a little extra for ya.
But - Thanks.
Oh, isn't it great to feel like a family again?
Cheers!
Stop touching me!
I'm not, I was clipping on my tie.
While you were touching me.
Stop it!
Why do we have to do this?
We don't have a picture of us all together.
We're a family - we should have a family portrait.
Francis isn't here.
I'm not gonna cough up $200 to fly him in for one silly picture.
Where's Dewey?
Dewey, get out of there - that's not your family.
You sure you want Autumn Leaves as a backdrop?
Yes!
You didn't even look at Happy Windmills.
It's more colourful.
Ooh, Space Shuttle!
Next!
I have a coupon for one 8x10 and two wallet size for $9.99.
I want that.
Not the Golden Moments, Family and Friends Collection or the Lifetime of Love.
I want one 8x10 and two wallet size for $9.99.
Fine.
We have an instalment plan, if that would help.
I brought a picture of Francis so he's in the portrait.
I'll hold it.
I'm gonna hold it.
Let go!
Come on!
Dewey, pants on, mister.
Sorry, this coupon's expired.
What?
!
What you want'll run you $39.50.
Ooh!
Lonely Beach!
We're kind of a Lonely Beach family.
Hal!
Another $5 and you have the Instant Memories set with double-exposure silhouettes.
Please just do what I'm asking you - I'm older!
It was my idea!
Yaarrgghhhh!
That is it!
Get up!
Get back!
Come here!
Go there!
We are gonna take this picture, and it is gonna be good.
And that means no faces, no tongues, no crossed eyes, no bunny ears.
We are gonna smile and look good, it will cost $9.99, and all this'll happen by the time I count three.
One.
Two.
Three.
The trouble with bleach is that you think your toilet is perfectly clean because it's white.
But is it?
With a revealer you can see that bleach only whitens difficult stains like limescale.
Harpic Power Plus removes tough stains easily and kills germs, giving you visibly perfect results.
Harpic Power Plus.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
What - ?
!
Those kids!
Not my Frampton Comes Alive!
"Honest, Dad, we didn't even know you had a watch"!
Thank God they paved the drive last year!
# Yes, no, maybe # I don't know # Can you repeat the question?
# You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # You're not the boss of me now # And you're not so big # Life is unfair # 'Jury duty?
They want me to do jury duty?
!
' I can't believe this!
You can't do it.
Spring break is coming up.
The boys are gonna be out of school.
I can't handle them by myself!
You're gonna have to tell them no!
That's not one of the options, Hal.
What are they thinking?
Jury duty?
!
This is America!
I don't have a choice!
Oh, yes, you do.
You wanna get out of jury duty?
You just let me handle this.
We, the jury, promise to faithfully uphold This'll be great!
I've never been ice-fishing before.
It combines my two favourite things, ice and holes!
A bunch of guys roughing it!
A true test of courage and determination!
Man against the elements!
No crust on mine, thank you.
I hope you packed enough toilet paper for four!
You're kidding!
How'd you get Piama's permission?
I don't need my wife's permission!
I picked a fight.
She kicked me out.
Oh, my God, Dewey, you are not gonna believe what just happened!
We were supposed to go exploring in the sewer!
I waited two hours for you!
You're not listening.
This is incredible!
You promised that when spring break started, you would take me!
I did all your chores, all your homework, I took your antibiotics - Dewey, just shut up!
We're trying to tell you something important.
We just saw Stevie's mom naked!
And she's a total babe.
We were at Stevie's getting stuff for the sewer when we hear something behind us.
We turn around and there she was, in the hallway, naked!
Buck naked, except for her shower cap.
First she was screaming, then Stevie was, then I was Yeah.
Why'd I do that?
Then she tore the curtains down to cover up!
But you could see through them.
I'm so glad they just remodelled.
That is not a good reason!
Mom walks around here naked all the time!
She was naked this morning.
She - If you've just combined those two things in my head, I will kill you!
No, we're good.
So, she was - I got to get going.
Where are the boys?
At the library.
I know.
But if they were doing something really bad, they'd have come up with a better lie.
So, deliberations start today.
Nervous?
Nice try.
You know I can't talk about it.
OK!
Is the counselman as tall as he looks on TV?
Hal!
Yes!
Your eyebrow went up!
It did not.
It's the Panty Bandit, isn't it?
This isn't right!
We're married.
We tell each other everything.
We've never kept secrets from each other in our entire relationship.
I keep secrets from you all the time.
Oh, fine Go!
I won't keep you from your ..
big, secret trial!
Thank you very much!
For what?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all.
You didn't say a word.
This sucks!
We been here 15 hours.
We haven't caught a single fish.
How much longer will this take?
You never know.
I been ice-fishing my entire life, never even seen a fish.
I'm with Francis.
I got bored on the drive here!
Can we at least talk?
About what?
We could use this opportunity to get to know each other better.
You know, one time I walked in on my two dads making love!
Guilty.
Not guilty.
And guilty.
That's seven guilty and five not guilty.
The contention, for those of you who don't think Marty stole the bike - If it'll get us out of here earlier, I'll change my vote.
What?
!
I don't feel that strongly either way.
Yeah, me, too!
Which side was winning again?
This is not a question of winning, or of voting to get out of here early!
We have to have some basis for deciding.
There was a trial!
And evidence, and laws Yeah-yeah-yeah.
Let's vote one more time before we get into all that detail.
We might just get lucky.
Who wants to change their votes?
Whatever!
There you go!
It's unanimous.
Hey, wait!
What do you think you're doing?
!
You can't send a 17-year-old kid to jail just cos you wanna go home early.
For God's sake, we took an oath!
Did you vote guilty?
Yes, because - Then, there's no problem.
We're all just agreeing.
Fine Then, I vote not guilty.
This is cool!
There's no alligators down here, right?
That's made up?
But if there were, they'd probably be blind, or albino, or transparent!
But that's not real.
This is so cool!
He hasn't shut up all morning.
I was just as excited the first time Francis took us.
It's kinda cute.
Did you get the snake?
Right here.
They'll hear him screaming in Russia.
Dude, finish the story!
She was standing there, buck naked!
I went like this.
Malcolm was like this.
It was incredible!
The sun was behind her.
She was glowing.
A naked, glowing angel!
Stevie, back me up on this.
That's what she looked like, right?
Can we go now?
I get to lead!
No, rear.
No, wait.
Front!
I'll scout ahead!
What?
You are talking about his mom.
Change the subject.
Show some class.
OK, I get it.
Whoo, Stevie!
Is that you or the sewer?
!
It turns out it wasn't a boil they removed but the vestiges of my unborn twin!
OK, let's just go.
Yeah!
Good idea!
Best idea I've heard all day!
OK, here's something interesting.
There's a gigantic bear out there!
Don't worry.
It's part of living in Alaska.
How far away is it?
Well, answer the question!
It's open!
I thought we were having lunch today.
Huh?
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's all this?
My research on the trial Lois got assigned to.
Oh, my God!
Reyes?
!
Did she talk about the four-fingered magician?
Was he any good?
She won't tell me anything.
I dug this up on my own.
Information is being suppressed from the jury.
Lois will have to find Moynihan guilty.
Why not?
He did it.
You're a fool!
Everyone knows the wife killed him.
What?
She loved him.
Didn't you read the letter?
How come she didn't admit being married before?
She was underage and it was annulled.
It means nothing.
The judge ruled it inadmissible.
The same judge that won't allow the cab driver to testify!
Well, if the wife did it, why did four witnesses say they saw a man leave the crime scene?
Oh!
A man ..
like this?
!
You just drew hair on!
If I could do it, she could!
She worked for two years at the Windmill Theatre.
Let me see that!
OK, here's our mark.
When we came here with Francis, this is the farthest we've ever gone.
This is it?
!
This is as far as you went?
!
Who would brag about this?
Mr Alligator?
So, Stevie, did your mom go to college?
What?
!
Did she get a degree?
Was she in a sorority?
Wait a minute.
Unless we thought some girl called Molly Hatchet ruled, this isn't our mark.
This has to be it!
We went right, right, straight, left, right, left, and right again.
No!
We went right, left, left, then straight, left, right, straight!
No.
We went ..
right, ..
left, ..
straight Oh, man, we're lost!
What?
No!
Oh, man!
What are we gonna do?
!
Nice!
We got him crying!
No, we really are lost!
What?
What do we do?
!
I knew you'd find some way to ruin this for me!
Even when you're trying to be nice, you make me miserable!
And now I get to die in the sewer!
A perfect end to a crappy life!
Shut up, Dewey!
Alright.
Let's focus on finding a way out.
Stevie's mom must be worried by now.
Shut up about my mom!
What?
I simply made a comment.
You're a perv!
I have a healthy interest in the opposite sex.
Well, they don't return the favour!
What does that mean?
Girls hate you.
That's not true!
Yes, it is.
Come on, Reese.
You're a joke.
Yeah.
Even I know it.
.
Marty claims he was at work, but his boss says he didn't show up until 6:00.
The gas-station attendant puts Marty there between 4:00 and 4:30, and as we remember from testimony - Can we vote again?
!
We've been through this five times!
We vote guilty, she votes not guilty.
We vote not guilty, she votes guilty.
Yeah.
So you go first this time!
Alright!
I abstain.
What is it that you want, lady?
I want you to do your job!
Weigh the facts of this case and make a reasoned decision!
You have the sworn testimony of the arresting officer, in which he states - Yeah, if you believe what he says.
OK!
Fair enough.
It is a question of credibility.
You have a high-school dropout with a history of reckless behaviour against a police-force veteran.
You can't trust cops.
They're always comin' up with ways to get you!
That's right!
My neighbour's a cop and he's got a 30-foot boat.
How can he afford that on a police salary?
They all get away with it!
Stop!
This is not about how you feel about cops!
This is not about who you like and who you hate!
This is about what you believe happened, based on the facts.
Did Marty or did Marty not steal the motorcycle?
!
Wait, I thought Marty was the cop!
Fine Let's go through this again.
Yes?
Is it OK to hate you?
Absolutely.
But the money was really being funnelled to Mr Reyes's mistress and their love child.
Once Moynihan found out, it was "Good night, Mr Reyes".
You've got nothing!
He was seen arguing with the victim.
He can't account for his whereabouts when the murder occurred, and they found the murder weapon in his car!
Means, motive and opportunity!
It's all a little too neat!
Because he's guilty!
My gut says he didn't do it!
Saying so doesn't make it so!
Talk to this guy!
YOU'RE AN IDIOT!
Oh, my God, that thing's a monster!
I've been around bears 40 years.
There's nothing to worry about.
Really?
Yep!
We just got to stay real quiet.
Pretty soon he'll get bored and fly away, ..
that is, unless he's protecting his eggs.
This is crazy!
We can't stay here!
Somebody's got to make a run for the truck.
That's a suicide mission!
Well, what are we supposed to do?
Stay here and starve to death?
He's right.
I say we try it.
I vote for Eric.
What?
!
Go to hell!
I'm not going!
You go!
I have a wife at home!
And my life doesn't mean anything?
Artie's the camp outcast.
Pete's an old coot!
It's a miracle he's alive!
I should've slit your throat when I had the chance.
This all looks the same!
Yes, this is the same.
It's all been exactly the same ever since the day I was born.
I start to trust them, they make me regret it.
I get my hopes up and they destroy them.
I - Shut up!
We get it!
Every girlfriend you ever had left you crying like a baby!
What?
!
Oh, who's Mr Big Shot now?
I'm a joke with the girls, huh?
What's worse, being a joke or a crybaby?
I wasn't crying that hard!
You wet your pants.
Oh, like you've ever even been with a girl!
I have a note from my doctor!
I could get a doctor if I wanted to.
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE!
That's right!
Turn on each other.
Well, you know what?
No girls like any of you.
And I don't blame them.
You're all pathetic.
You know who's a joke?
Girls!
Yeah!
They make our lives miserable.
You can never understand what they want.
They always say, "Stop staring".
They don't laugh at farts!
They only wanna talk about clothes.
They cry all the time.
Man, this is helping us get out  Whoo!
Time?
Time?
!
In yer face!
See?
The wife did have time to run down here from home!
That leaves her two minutes to stab him, remove the head, and still make it to the party in time.
It makes sense!
And the blood magically jumped to his clothes Do you really need this spelled out?
After killing her husband, she took off the bloody suit and rubbed it all over Moynihan!
Impossible!
You just don't wanna be proven wrong!
I am not wrong!
The knife entered at a downward angle.
She was 5'2".
He was 6'4".
She'd have had to ask him to pick her up so she could stab him!
She could've stood on something!
Oh, she brought a stepladder Look!
A milk crate!
She could've hidden behind the dumpster, stood on the crate, pulled out the knife and stabbed him several times with a downward motion, like this!
Agh!
I may be fat, stupid, colour-blind and dyslexic, but I don't have three nipples!
Shut up!
That's a mole.
You!
Your family changed their name so you couldn't track them down.
No-one will miss you.
I'm sure it started with an O. All three of you are pea-brained idiots!
And I do suffer more than everybody else.
Let's just vote on it!
Who votes for Francis?
Who votes for Eric?
Artie?
Pete?
Four votes!
No, you tricked me!
Argh!
He'll reject me!
I I've tried me!
I taste awful!
Arrgh!
Alright, that's the worst thing any of us has ever done.
I'm not proud, but we had no choice.
Like I care about your opinion!
Wait a minute.
Why don't we hear eating?
He got to the truck!
Pete!
Pete!
Pete!
See you in hell!
The witness saw Marty gassing up the motorcycle an hour after the theft.
That gas station closes at 5:00.
Not on Fridays.
That's in the transcript.
Er, I think we're ready for another vote!
Lois?
Go ahead.
By show of hands, who thinks the defendant is guilty?
Great!
Let's go tell the judge.
Wait!
I don't think Marty is guilty.
What?
!
I went through all these papers.
The kid sings in a church choir.
He wouldn't do something like this.
That is not fact.
That's bias.
You're basing a decision on feelings that have nothing to do with facts!
Facts are things, like witnesses seeing Marty steal the bike, like Marty being apprehended while he was driving it!
Like Marty pulling tons of stupid stunts just like this one.
Those are the facts.
I just don't wanna send that poor boy to jail!
Believe me, jail will do more good than three years of military school.
Military school?
I didn't read anything about that.
Oh, yeah!
I know I saw that somewhere.
He dropped out of vocational school.
After the school where he got caught messing with the teacher's aid.
No, I know for a fact that Francis went - Who?
Oh, my God!
I think I have to excuse myself from this jury.
All in favour?
I'm trying to be the best me I can be, but I don't know what to say to girls, so I say something mean.
I'm afraid of getting hurt.
My problem is, I get so frustrated over things I can't control.
I forget people have their own will.
I play ..
mind games.
It's all I have.
Why isn't there ever a flash flood when you need one?
I really want a girlfriend.
I want somebody to hang out with!
Yeah.
Someone you can talk to.
Someone to hug.
Someone to show my poetry to.
You write poetry?
I dabble.
What do you think of Brenda Pollock?
She's nice.
She'd be good for you.
You'd make a cute couple.
I thought so, too.
Hey, I know this sounds weird, but can I read you one of my poems?
We'd love it.
ARGH!
AGH!
Aaaargh!
Hey!
What happened?
Did you read them your poetry?
You guys can't even do this right!
I wanna serve on another jury!
I messed up this time, but next time I won't.
I don't schedule that.
I'm sure you have connections.
Please!
There was a mistrial.
Everything's backed up.
You'll have to wait.
I'll do the best I can, if you'll stop bothering me right now.
Deal!
I gotta go.
My husband's probably going crazy without me!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
'I agree, Mrs Wiggins.
These pastries are delightful.
' Son, whatcha doing?
I'm having a tea party with Mrs Bear and the ladies.
Oh, that's good.
Care to join us?
Yeah, I have actually, a Why don't we go buy that stealth bomber model you've been asking for?
OK.
OK.
Sometimes it's just too easy.
# Yes, no, maybe # I don't know # Can you repeat the question?

The Norton anti-virus is out.
Your mom let you?
She's there now!
Are you serious?
What's the big deal?
We have a life outside this place.
How are we doing, gentlemen?
Everyone sticking to the experiment?
Absolutely.
Right on track, sir.
I know how tempting it is ..
to stray from a rigidly defined protocol.
It's the siren's song of pure research but you must resist her seductive powers because  Unstable compounds require stable minds.
Jackass.
It's like he's talking to children.
It was a legitimate variation.
There was less than a 48% chance this would happen.
Well, your cavalier disregard for the laws of the classroom, not to mention the laws of nature, have led to the inevitable.
It will now take weeks to decontaminate that classroom.
During that time, you'll be placed back into the general population.
We can't do that.
The whole school hates us.
They'll destroy us!
Rage is a projection of their own insecurities.
And as for me I've been offered a temporary position in the phys ed department where I'll get to wear a whistle ..
and dress in shorts!
I'm sure none of this will be reflected in your grades Don't play connect the dots with your chickenpox.
You'll get an infection.
I'm bored!
I know.
It's no fun being sick.
I'm bored!
I'm itchy!
I'm bored!
Honey, remember we were gonna use our not-horrible voice?
I'm bored!
Then find something to do!
Here.
Play with these.
I don't wanna.
You will be contagious for six days.
Want to spend them here, like a good boy, or in the hospital?
You don't go to the hospital for chick OK.
Damn it!
Maybe we could tack up a blanket.
I'll tear the porch down and build another one.
Good luck getting permission from the council.
What?
Part of the house is on tribal land, from the window to the wolf picture.
What?
The whole house used to be on the reservation, but my idiot grandfather built it on a glacier.
It moves two inches a year.
In Wow.
So, part of this house is on an Indian reservation?
Dealer has 20.
Look at them.
All they're thinking about is how many places they'll dispose of my body.
Hey, Ian, Eddie!
How are you doing?
What are you doing?
There's no more seats.
There's a seat over there.
Scoot over.
Go sit down.
You're gonna get in trouble.
Hey!
Hey!
Wassup?
Wassup?
God, it's so great to have a normal conversation.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Is that from the new Ministry album?
What?
Abandon all hope.
Is that from the new Ministry album?
Actually, it's from Dante's Inferno.
It's the inscription over the gates of hell.
That is way dark.
Kick that guy's butt!
Remember when I did?
No, he kicked your butt!
You want me to kick your butt?
!
Argh!
Damn!
A splinter!
You are dead!
You are dead!
Argh!
Don't pick!
It will get infected.
What?
You're making it worse.
Let me get it.
You carry a first-aid kit?
Just a crisis pouch.
I leave the kit in my locker.
There.
Wow!
That didn't hurt at all!
Thanks.
Hey, Dewey.
Wow!
Look at that!
Is this helping take your mind off the itching?
It was.
Oh, you've got a split and you've got a crossover.
All those dominoes.
All set up.
Just ready to Hey!
Check out Alesha.
En fuego.
Totally.
Yeah, she's cute.
Check out Pam.
Muy en fuego.
Totally!
Yeah, she's cute, too.
Excuse me.
Hey, Stevie.
It looks like everyone found a place.
Parasites adapting to a new host body.
Except Herkabe, I guess.
We heard the cleanup crew's gonna put their dumpster where we skate.
Where are we supposed to go?
Why do they pick on us?
Damn Krelboynes.
I'll think of something.
Hey, Malcolm.
Can you settle this?
You know Stacy?
Yeah.
Is she en fuego or muy en fuego?
Hard to say.
My God!
Dewey!
Look what you've built here!
You have stairs and a ramp!
You've spelled your name.
Oh, so many, ..
many dominoes.
Where did they all come from?
From the Lippers.
They got a crate the year Mr Lipper was paralysed.
They even buried him with one of his dominoes.
So this isn't really a complete set.
Oh, no, Dewey, don't scratch.
It's itchy!
I know, but sometimes you just have to restrain yourself.
Even if you feel like ripping your eyes out of their sockets rather than go one more second without scratching.
Will you watch this for me?
I have to go to the bathroom.
OK, son.
Reese!
Don't even think about it!
What's going on?
He was about to knock down Dewey's dominoes.
What?
I didn't do anything.
You're not going to.
They're keeping Dewey from driving my crazy!
If they get knocked over, I'll blame you.
If a door slams and knocks them over, I'll blame you.
If a condor dies in flight, crashes through our roof and knocks them over, I'll blame you!
But that's not fair.
I will blame you!
Don't.
What?
I saw that look.
What look?
My look!
Now I know where I got it from.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'm gonna get a drink.
Let's go.
I can get it myself.
It's alright.

Man, I can't believe the school gave the skaters our basketball court!
Skaters safety program.
Sounds suspicious.
So what do we do?
We kick their butts!
Guys!
Guys!
There's an easier way.
We'll take over the east court.
No, that's where the Goths hang out.
Why don't you let me worry about the Goths?
They can't take our court!
That's where I second-hand smoke!
Some old lady complained we were scaring her.
No, you weren't.
Look at this handwriting, the girlish swirls.
This is no old lady.
It's Dabney.
Well, where are we supposed to go now?
What about the posers' corner?
You're trippin' if you think you'll stop us!
This is our turf now!
We're in the middle of a student council meeting.
That ain't no thang.
Thang is 200 years of oppression in this country.
What are you talking about?
It's off the hook.
Justice in the hole, too.
You haven't heard the last of this!
Sucker!
Um, Kevin, you're supposed to wear underwear with those.
Don't make me blow this!
Do not make me blow this!
Who removed my whistle pea?
!
That is a detentionable offence!
It's awfully tempting, isn't, Hal?
Go ahead.
I'll blame it on Reese.
You'll get off scot-free.
Alright!
Pencils down!
Turn in your geometry tests.
But I didn't study!
Turn around, old man.
There's nothing for you here.
I can't take this any more.
If I hear one more en fuego  ..
and six on top for the dealer.
Whoops!
Free deal.
Hey!
I had blackjack!
You're cheating me out of my winnings!
Come on.
Relax.
I don't want trouble.
It's all in the tribe, right?
Let's just calm down.
I don't wanna hear it.
It's what your old man used to pull.
He was nothing but a lying jackass!
Tell me something I don't know.
This was just a misunderstanding.
There.
You got your chips back.
See?
We take care of our own, here.
Francis, maybe you should - I'll turn the fan on once Ivan leaves.
Dewey?
I spoke with the doctor.
He says you can go to school tomorrow.
OK.
Tomorrow?
So the dominoes Go back in the crate tonight!
Let me make this easy.
I'm not leaving until I know you're at work and I can wait all day.
All I've got is school.
Hey, Malcolm!
I'm sorry.
I can't listen to you talk about who's hot.
This stuff used to sound fine to me, but now it's stupid!
You are stupid!
I don't mean that in an insulting way.
I mean that in a factual way.
You wanna say hot in a different language?
There are 700 languages!
Vary it a little!
We came to tell you a fight's going down at the school.
Between who?
Everybody.
Oh, man!
Hey, come on, dealer.
Let's go!
And that's seven for the dealer.
Piama, where have you been?
Shopping.
You were supposed to relieve me.
Do you know what time it is?
Now I do.
Where did you get the money?
I took $200 from the stash!
But that's all our money!
We can't afford that!
It's all in the tribe.
Ha!
Huh?
Wha?
Wha?
!
What happened?
I cleaned them up.
You knocked them over?
!
Without me?
!
Why would I knock them over?
I spent four days setting them up.
What's going on?
Why did you spend all of that money?
!
Hey!
You talked about easing our people's suffering.
I suffered a little less today.
You don't spend money and not say anything.
What's the problem?
It's all in the tribe, right?
That's what this is about?
Am I overstepping my bounds because I'm white?
No, but it's It feels weird.
Look, we're married.
That means I'm part of your family just like you're a part of mine.
If I had anything in my heritage besides mini vans and non-stop screaming, I'd share it.
It's not the same!
Because I'm not your people, I don't deserve that money?
!
Why are you so obsessed about the money?
!
Because!
I wanna pay Lavernia so we can go!
What do you mean?
We live here!
What?
!
You want to spend your life in this godforsaken place?
This godforsaken place is where I grew up!
It's our home!
You should have said something!
I have been complaining about this place!
I thought you were a complainer!
You complain about everything.
Yeah, but this is real.
I hate this place!
I can't even imagine raising our kids here!
Kids?
!
I hate kids!
These seem like some pretty big issues.
Yeah.
You know, we got married so fast So what are we gonna do?
We both like wrestling movies.
Yeah, and we both like pizza.
I love pizza!
Sausage and mushroom?
Yeah, on half.
We wait till the jocks take out the Goths and then we swoop in.
I made an alliance with the drama club.
When the skaters see me drop my cape, they'll come in.
No-one'll expect us to be working together.
Is this a good idea?
It's too late for second thoughts.
The tribes have Balkanised.
They don't like each other.
Oh, right.
We don't stop until we have total control.
Deploy special shield.
We're just right, we're OK, we're smarter now than yesterday!
School is fun, cos learning is for everyone.
They've got Derek.
He bites.
No!
Stop!
This has gone too far.
Look what you've been reduced to!
I'm helping!
We all used to hate this school equally!
We hated the teachers!
We hated the administration!
We hated the building!
But now you've taken that hate and turned it against each other!
And why?
Because people dress differently or talk differently?
!
You're just making school even worse!
Dabney was a Krelboyne two weeks ago.
Now he's a jock!
That proves that these differences are meaningless.
We need to focus on what makes us the same, because if we hate each other, who's gonna hate school?
You were a Krelboyne?
Ha!
You've got a Krelboyne!
You guys got one right behind you!
He's the one who wanted to fight in the first place!
Hey, we got one, too!
I found one!
He's our leader!
If it's any consolation, we get our new classroom in five weeks.
Thanks for the heads-up on the underwear.
No problem.
What is with the self-pity?
!
Albert Einstein had to carry spare pants until he was 24 and did he cry about it?
No.
He drew on that experience and helped build the first nuclear bomb.
Now buck up and get in the van.
Oh, video camera!

"..
break free of the atmosphere, a rocket ship must attain speeds of 25,000mph".
Bull!
If they went that fast they'd be squashed in the back of their seats!
They wouldn't float around!
You're confusing acceleration with velocity.
You feel it at first, but once you're up to speed, you don't notice.
Right now we're on a planet spinning at We're also travelling around the sun at almost 67,000mph.
The solar system is hurtling through the galaxy which is hurtling away from other galaxies cos the universe is expanding.

Firing jets, Captain.
Somebody's breaking in!
I'll do it in the morning.
''  What was that?
Oh, my God!
Hal!
I'll get him, Lois!
Ah!
Argh!
Got him!
What would've happened if Reese didn't knock him out?
He would've seen our TV and stereo and known he'd made a mistake.
Let go of my arm!
He came through the window right in front of us!
I can't explain it.
It was like we were paralysed.
My son Reese came in swinging this bat!
He saved us all!
Yeah, it's a good thing Reese got to him before I did.
And, er, where were you, sir?
I was in bed.
Trapped in bed.
My wife insists on tucking in the corners.
I mean, really tucking them in!
I saw his head.
It looked like a fat pitch sitting over the plate.
If only there were more kids like you our streets would be a lot safer.
Thanks.
You look familiar.
Did you ever participate in our ride-along programme?
Sorta.
It's like being in a straitjacket!
You twist, and twist, and you can't shake the damn sheets loose!
The important thing is we caught him.
Let me show you.
Follow me to the bedroom and I'll tuck you in.
Sir!
You don't tuck in police officers.
Craig, I got your lunch.
Sorry I'm late.
I picked up the burgers.
I had to drive across town to get your chicken from Nugget World!
I thought you said you wanted to help me lead a normal life!
Did you get the extra mayo?
Yes!
From which place?
When are you getting a nurse?
Well, it's just that I've been so busy with having my arms and legs broken when your kid's dog chased me out in traffic I can't sleep knowing the trauma my cat suffers staying at mother's.
And all the forehead sticks I used learning to go to the bathroom.
Craig, the insurance company gave you money for a nurse!
Oh, Lois, poor, sweet, money-wasting Lois.
I've got something better.
Oliver!
Oh, my God!
It's a monkey!
It's a helper monkey.
They're highly trained.
They donate them to the permanently disabled.
You're not permanently disabled!
Craig, I am not taking care of you and a wild animal!
It's not a wild animal.
It's a capuchin monkey.
They're nature's butlers.
I've got a good one, too.
His brother worked for Stephen Hawking.
When was the last time this thing was cleaned?
This is the worst job in the world!
Why do we put up with this?
I'm still paying off law school.
Everybody, clear out.
You're fired.
What?
!
The camp's closing.
They cut down the last tree.
Anyone want a picture with it?
A mining company bought the land.
You gotta leave today.
We're out without notice?
!
It's the circle of life here.
They cut down the trees, then the mining company strips the land.
Then they'll turn what's left into a nuclear waste dump to wean ourselves from our unhealthy dependence on foreign oil!
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to move back in with my parents.
They gave me a tour of the station!
The mirrors in the interrogation room are two-way!
It's good thing they didn't have that before!
"For heroism and meritorious action".
I'm so proud of you!
Dewey, are you gonna be able to go to sleep now?
You saw all the policemen and how strong the bars are!
Yeah, but - And the police station is too big for a helicopter to carry it away to a hideout under the sea!
But - No buts, Dewey!
That guy is in a jail cell.
He's not going anywhere.
With our legal system, he's probably back on the streets right now.
Dewey!
Mom, Dad, this has got me thinking.
Usually those cops are throwing me in the back of their squad cars.
But today they were clapping for me.
You're a real hero!
It was really cool!
Protecting you guys!
Saving your lives.
Thanks again.
It's made me realise for the first time in my life I know what my purpose is.
I think I've found my calling.
Mom, Dad, I wanna be a pig.
'Go to sleep!
' I'm still scared.
Read me a story.
Please?
I've already read you every book in this place.
Please?
"Aardvark, a burrowing mammal of Southern Africa".
"Myocardium, the muscle tissue of the heart".
It's alright!
It's alright!
It was me turning off the light.
Where are ya?
I knew you'd be back!
Come on, you sonofa-!
Sorry.
Go back to sleep.
Come and go.
It turns out it was all a simple misunderstanding!
It's Larry who should've gotten the spin-off show, not the Ropers.
Huh, Oliver?
Oh, Lois, you're not drinking your tea.
Oliver, Lois takes sugar in her tea.
One lump.
I usually like to thank him when he does something right.
Um, thank you, Oliver.
Isn't he amazing?
He makes the bed, does dishes, even changes his own diaper!
Oliver!
Temple massage.
Ahhh!
Ah!
This is about as good as it gets!
Lois, you want some of this?
I have to go!
Ahh!
Ahhhh!
He's like a frail geisha.
Chah-bloogh!
Hey, what's going on here?
We're playin'.
It's getting a little loud.
This is a nice neighbourhood.
Let's keep it that way.
Stay in school.
Hey!
Where are your helmets?
That's not safe!
Who the hell are you?
!
Ouch!
Ow!
See?
You should be more careful.
Play safe.
Be smart.
Did you get the job?
It was a dumb idea auditioning for a cruise ship.
What kind of piano player can't play Cabaret?
!
This is useless!
We have to go where there's work!
No!
Something will come up.
What?
!
We know you're in there!
What's wrong?
We served your eviction notice 30 days ago.
You must leave.
What?
Why didn't you tell me?
Because it's not happening!
The tribal council made a deal.
You're getting a settlement.
Part of a settlement.
One-fifteenth of your property is on tribal land.
We'll live in the other part of the house.
You can't do that.
This area's gonna be an arsenic containment-basin.
Nobody's stealing my property!
Let's just all cool down.
Er, you may actually not wanna touch her.
Don't tell me how to do my job.
Alright, missy, let's get one thing straight.
What time is it?
Ah, damn!
It's too dark to see my Rolex!
No matter, I'll just take out the maximum amount and everything will be fine.
Yeah, that ought to do it.
Now, where did I park my Bentley?
Damn, my inability to see in the dark!
Hey!
Can I help you with something?
Your money's hanging out of your pocket.
This is a bad neighbourhood!
Thank you.
You know when your cat doesn't want to know.
You'll know when he doesn't want to be disturbed.
And you'll know when he wants something he really likes.
Like new tastier Whiskas pouches.
Gently steam-cooked for total satisfaction.
Ohh, that lasagne smells good!
It took you long enough.
Did you have to fly to Italy to get it?
Never mind.
Let's dig in.
Argh!
Ohh!
Hah!
Hot!
Hot!
Hot!
Let's just let it cool down a little bit.
Ow!
Oh!
What is this?
Oh, hot!
Tongue!
Please, God, no!
Water!
Water!
Good monkey!
Closer.
Closer!
Ahh!
Hot!
Hot!
Hot!
Hot!
It looks like someone smashed up your trash cans pretty good.
If you brought them in on time it wouldn't happen.
Oliver!
Is my milk shake ready?
It was supposed to be ready an hour ago!
If it's warm, you can go ahead and drink it cos I won't!
Alright, I will!
Where is it?
!
Oliver?
You know, I've changed my mind.
I'm not in the mood for milk shake now.
Oh, well!
Since you did go to all that trouble!
Mmmm!
Good!
"Another perfect landing - "  Well, I've been awake for a week straight.
The first 96 hours were tough, but I'm starting to get my second wind.
Who needs sleep anyway?
It's just a waste of time.
They say that Tommy Citizen, he only got, like, ..
well, he didn't What was I talking about?
Never mind.
Craig, I can't stay long.
I've got your mail.
Jeez, it's boiling in here!
Really?
I hadn't noticed anything!
Ah-hah!
I'm just having a pleasant afternoon home here with Oliver!
What?
!
He tried to poison me!
He's trying to cook me alive!
He's evil!
An animal with a brain the size of a piece of gum is running your house.
You're paranoid!
I am NOT paranoid!
I've seen him staring at me when I'm pretending to be asleep!
You are not staying with me!
That monkey is not -  Lois, you tell such amusing stories!
Shhh!
You are getting a real nurse tomorrow.
What are ya doin'?
I was waitin' for that spot!
Ohh, you got a problem with me, pal?
Oh-hoh!
Bring it on!
You want it, you've got it!
I'll kick your ass!
You think I'm afraid of you?
I am NOT afraid!
No-one's tucked in now!
Just give me 30 seconds!
I'll beat you like I was your daddy!
I am gonna pound your head out through your butt and then I'm gonna make you kiss it!
I am very sorry, sir!
Oh, yeah, you're gonna be sorry!
Where ya goin'?
You running away, little girl?
Come out here and fight like a man!
Hey, Mom, what are you doing?
Unloading the groceries.
You're a little far on the sidewalk, aren't you?
Who cares?
Grab a bag.
You have to leave the sidewalk free.
Stop stalling and help unload.
Are you walking away from me?
!
Excuse me?
!
You can't leave your car here.
I'll leave it wherever I wanna leave it.
Well, I'd hate to see anything happen to your car.
Just bring in the bags, Reese.
Officer in need of assistance!
QUICKLY!
OFFICER IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE!
"" Ohhh!
"" "911, emergency".
That lawyer was an idiot!
Are you kidding?
A $50 fine was a bargain!
It cost ten times that to wire the deputy's jaw shut.
He deserved it!
This is not helping.
Here's the settlement.
Use it to pay your fine.
I'm not paying a fine!
I'm getting a real lawyer and taking it to trial!
That'd take months!
There is a bulldozer in the yard!
It's gonna flatten this house!
I'm not scared of a bulldozer.
The bulldozer doesn't care if you're scared!
It will still crush you!
We have to leave!
I can't.
Why are you so scared to leave?
I don't know!
Francis, I've been on this reservation my whole life.
I don't know anything else.
I'm just a hick.
I'm not like you!
I can't just pick up and start a new life whenever I need to.
I'm not as brave as you, OK?
Brave?
!
I'm not brave!
I just didn't know any better!
What?
If I had had any idea of how horrible it was up here, I never would've come!
And I never would have met you.
I'm not brave.
I'm stupid and lucky.
You're with me now so my stupid luck will take care of you.
Hopefully one-fifteenth of a share will pay off our fine and maybe buy us a bus ticket.
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh, my God!
That's more than I made all last year!
See, this is what I'm talking about!
Oh!
Craig, are you in there?
Craig?
!
What happened?
!
Behind you!
Urgh!
Huh?
Oh!
What the hell is wrong with that monkey?
!
He's crazy!
Well, he picked the wrong guy to mess with!
OH!
Oh, no!
God, please, no!
Pick up Craig!
No, leave me!
Save yourself!
I am not gonna leave you, buddy!
Ah!
You'll be safe here.

I wouldn't have pictured it ending like this!
Huh?

So, where do you wanna go?
I don't care.
All I know is we've got $2,000 left and a car pointed south.
