{START OF EPISODE 1}
And to Ambassador Fanshawe for bringing his team all the way here to Santa Barbara to lobby for the rights of this innocent boy or should I say man, Colin, as you've certainly become one through this ordeal.
From his host family who stood by him this whole time.
Charles, where are you?
Take a bow.
To our distinguished Ambassador, who has delivered us, not only a dismissal of the case, but a new faith in the American justice system.
All right.
I'm in.
Describe item.
Really?
You've forgotten already?
I'm sorry.
But I was busy "James Bond-ing" it up in here.
It's a Star Wars toy, Shawn.
Easy as that.
We went through this twice.
It's not a toy.
It's a collector's item.
It's a pristine 1978 Darth Vader with a double-telescoping light saber.
Shouldn't you be in bed?
It's 7:45.
At least at home?
We're parked in front of my house.
I don't want to get caught in a car with an 11-year-old kid.
I don't want that stupid Ambassador's son moving back home with my prized toy.
So maybe you and James Bond should hurry up.
Shawn, it's official, you never take a case without me again.
Are you playing with the toys?
Dude, this kid has Mattel Electronics Football Two, the one where you can throw passes.
Suck it, hyphens.
Your partner said he could get it back in eight minutes.
I want my 500 bucks returned.
Shawn, what the hell is going on?
Please tell me you're not eating.
Dude, this kid has a mini fridge in his room.
Shawn, I will leave you here.
I will call in an anonymous tip saying that there's an intruder in the upstairs bedroom.
Yes, I will.
Got it.
You sure?
Hundred percent.
Good.
Get the hell out of my car.
I know there's three doors in this hallway.
I heard something going on upstairs.
When?
When we walked up.
The Ambassador's bedroom is off limits.
Let's get back to our post.
Shawn, where are you?
Wait, did you hear that?
A voice.
It was muffled like the TV.
Did you check the office?
Hey!
Better call the guards!
What happened?
You want the good news or the bad news?
What do you think?
"I am not your mother".
He didn't say that, Shawn.
What's the bad news?
Drive!
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Oh, Carlton, it's late.
What are you doing?
The asinine polygraph machine isn't working right.
Oh, that's weird.
It was working last week.
It's not now.
It sucks.
Whoever made it sucks.
Here, look, I'll show you.
Hold that with your right hand.
Name.
Juliet.
O'Hara.
No sign of deception.
Truth.
See?
It's working fine.
Let's go.
No, no, no.
One more.
Just one more question.
Are you What's a good question?
I got one.
Are you currently dating anyone?
Answer any time you like.
Hmm.
You seem to be experiencing some stress.
I don't see what this has to do with anything.
It's just a control question.
You and I both know you're not dating anyone, right?
So simply answer truthfully, we'll know the machine is working properly, like you say it is.
Unless of course you are dating someone and you want to tell me about it.
What are you getting at?
Nothing.
I'm simply testing a potentially defective piece of machinery.
And since partners don't lie or keep secrets from each other because we put our lives in each other's hands, I'm asking a question I believe I know the answer to.
Are you currently or have you ever been in a relationship with anyone at the station?
Well, see that's a different question.
Answer either one.
I'm flexible.
I don't have time for this.
Don't do this, Shawn.
Gus, we can't just tell them that we broke into the house.
Just please get to the body some other way.
I'm seeing a woman.
Really?
Can you tell me her name?
Or is it a secret?
A dead woman.
Murder victim.
Under a bed in the dark.
The rest of the house is full of people, a formal gathering, time is running out.
Tell you what, why don't you check every house in Santa Barbara and get back to me after you have something a little more specific.
Excuse me?
That's incredibly specific.
First door on the left down the hallway.
She'll be lying on the right hand side, she's wearing an expensive pair of earrings.
Stop being so specific, Shawn.
That's really precise.
It doesn't hurt to just drive up there.
Really?
Why the sudden need to follow every one of Spencer's whims?
I'm going to check it out.
Of course you are.
I am too.
Great job, Spencer.
You had a vision at a diplomat's residence.
Next time why don't you try and get us into North Korea?
It'll be easier.
I know I left my jacket on the chair.
God, I had my wallet in the pocket.
I am sensing that your jacket is in the kitchen in a wine crate buried under some hay.
It's okay.
I'm a psychic.
Really?
I felt badly.
His wallet was inside.
I'm sorry but we've just completed a party and as the Ambassador's workplace, this house is technically British soil.
I'm sure you can understand why we would refuse entry to somebody on such an outlandish hunch.
Of course we can.
So they just bust out immunity and that's it?
They just did.
Awesome.
Put that on my bucket list.
Before or after invisible plane?
After.
Jet pack, Wonder Woman plane, immunity.
No, wait, jet pack Shawn.
Forgive me, gentlemen, but you must understand how unconventional all this sounds.
Okay, how did you do that?
Most incredible thing I've seen.
I'm so sorry.
He found my jacket, with his finger.
I am sensing the victim, glittery gown, sleeveless.
Dark hair?
Yes.
Up from the shoulders.
She was wearing new earrings.
You have my permission to enter the house.
Richard.
He's describing Annabeth.
Here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here.
The body is under the bed.
That's not possible.
You see I'm so, so, so, so sure.
I don't think more "so's" is the answer, Shawn.
Perhaps you should check again.
Ambassador, if you would all just indulge me one last time.
To the backyard.
I sense something here.
This door's been closed recently.
Oh, come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
What is it, Spencer?
Did someone forgot to check the chlorine?
Lassie, I'm going to need to borrow your flashlight.
Well?
Well, what?
Well, don't you think you owe me an apology?
You know what?
You're right, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for expecting a little bit of honesty out of you.
Oh, we're still on that?
Still on what?
Hey, guys, what's going on?
Okay, fine, I am seeing Shawn.
We've been dating a while.
We kept it from you.
Does that make you happy?
Happy's not the word.
I think we need to see the Chief.
Oh, okay, so now you want to tell on us?
Actually, O'Hara, we need to see the Chief about getting me a new partner.
One I can trust.
No.
No?
"N".
Capital "O".
Carlton, I'm not reassigning you.
We have a big murder case here.
Why would you even ask such a thing?
Why don't you ask her?
Whatever you do, don't hook her up to a polygraph machine because you're not going to get anywhere.
You hooked her up to a lie detector?
And you want the new partner?
Chief, there is something I need to come clean about.
Oh, you're going to come clean to her?
Wait, wait, does it affect your ability to do your job right now?
No.
Then why do you think that I would want to know?
What I do want is for the two of you to work out whatever silliness is going on between the two of you.
Now, I've got a briefing to give.
The victim was Annabeth York, 31, a member of Ambassador Fanshawe's technical staff.
Now she'd been staying in the Santa Barbara area working with a diplomatic team on behalf of a jailed British exchange student, Colin Hennessey.
Accused of strangling his then girlfriend, Sarah Peele, based on witness testimony of seeing him driving his car, a 2010 red Chevy Cruze, from the scene of the crime.
Now stay with me because now it gets good.
Ten days ago, Miss York successfully located another witness putting Mr. Hennessey far from the crime, giving him an alibi and earning him his release, and the dropping of all charges.
Now the party was a farewell to the Ambassador and a thank you for the clearing of an innocent man.
This case was brought to our attention by perhaps the most impressive, bit of premonition yet from Mr. Spencer here.
He not only knew the address, but the initial location, the jewelry that the victim was wearing, and also that the party punch was a bit skunky.
So, Mr. Spencer, strong work.
Do we have a suspect?
Security chased an intruder from an upstairs window.
Apparently the intruder escaped via the backyard.
That wasn't the guy.
That was probably just the paparazzi.
Or a raccoon.
Though a raccoon with a video camera would be an ideal suspect.
A quick word.
No, thanks.
Can Gus come?
I don't want to come.
Shawn.
Miss York was highly trusted despite being the lowest ranking member of the Diplomatic team.
Come on, Dad, I wanted to hear the rest of that briefing, see how it ended.
You were in that house, weren't you?
I may have been under the bed.
Had to hide from the guards.
That's where I saw the girl.
You broke in.
I snuck in.
You crashed a diplomat's party?
I was only there to steal Darth Vader from his kid's room.
Kid, you're going to get caught, you're going to blow your whole psychic thing and you're going to become the prime suspect.
Miss York was highly trusted despite being the lowest ranking member of the Diplomatic team.
I am sensing the victim, she was wearing new earrings, glittery gown, sleeveless.
Here's my question, if this is such a major international incident that the Ambassador flew in and rented a house in Santa Barbara to oversee the whole thing.
Then why was it passed off to the lowest ranking member of his staff?
I think the Ambassador was having an affair with the victim.
Come to visit the stiffs?
What?
No.
It's okay.
I understand your fascination.
It's completely natural.
The urge to comb their hair, try on their jewelry.
Woody.
Woody.
I snuck in here to take a peek at your preliminary report before you present to the other cops tomorrow.
You didn't kill her, did you?
No.
My son needs my help.
I think he might have bit off a bit too much this time.
You don't have to tell me.
I know Gus well.
Shawn.
Him, too.
Never thought of them as brothers though.
Bit of a game changer, I'll tell you that.
Look, he's in a pinch.
He needs to solve this case first.
Say no more.
The problem, Shawn, is that we know they were hooking up but without access to the Ambassador, we're stuck.
What do you mean you'll handle it?
No.
You need to pick a side.
She has little to no defensive wounds.
So she knew her attacker.
Or she paid somebody to murder her.
Now that I've said that out loud I like your theory better.
But that's not even the big reveal.
She was strangled in a very similar fashion Why is there a second autopsy report here?
I remember the identical circumstances occurring in that student's murder last year.
They accused a Brit.
Colin Hennessey.
That's the case this woman was working on.
I know, right?
I pulled out the report.
The strangulation marks are a match.
So these murders were committed by the same person?
I was thinking replicate robots, but now that I say it out loud, I like your idea better.
I may even have a print on the body.
Woody, favor.
Does it involve sleeping overnight in the cooler?
No.
Then anything.
Don't hurry.
I never do.
So, it's someone that was here now and last May 16th?
Yeah.
Yeah.
If Woody is right.
Did you get back into the Ambassador's house yet?
Yeah.
I'm negotiating that now.
Bye.
I'm not apologizing to him.
Fine.
You apologize.
I have nothing to apologize for.
You begged to borrow my telescoping Vader and then refused to return it.
I can't even find your stupid toy.
Yeah.
That's right you can't.
You want to know why?
You don't want to know why.
Justin, your good pal Mason here takes off for England on Friday.
I'm going back to New York, you moron.
The embassy is in New York.
If we were in England we wouldn't be Ambassadors, you twit.
Let me hit him.
Right in the face.
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.
Wait.
What?
Can't.
I don't think immunity works in that direction.
Can we go now?
I don't want him to be my friend anyway.
I just wanted to use his pool.
Well, you'll never use it now.
Yes, I will because I'm going to become friends with the next family that rents that place.
And then I'm going to practically live in that pool.
Well, I'm going to go pee in it.
Don't forget to sit down when you do it, you girl!
Have fun swimming in my pee!
Okay, no one's peeing in anything.
Except for you in your bed, you wanker.
Okay, that's it.
I'm going to beat your pompous little Okay, no.
Gus.
What?
We can't argue like this with children.
I called us all together because we need to have a summit like gentlemen.
We need to do it in your kitchen, Mason.
We need to do it before your dad gets home.
Whoa!
Why my house?
Because you're the one that started all this.
By stealing my stuff.
I didn't even like it.
The new Star Wars movies are way better than the older ones, anyway.
No, it's not.
Whatever.
We are dealing with a crazy person.
I told you this wasn't going to work.
You stole a key from a kid?
Come on, Gus, that was no kid.
That's the product of centuries of in-breeding.
Do I hear potato chips?
I believe they're called crisps in this house, Gus, and, yes, you do.
You raided the mini fridge again?
Be reasonable.
Chips don't go in the fridge, but this can of Sprite Zero does.
Dude, put it away.
What do we have here?
Accused of strangling his then girlfriend, Sarah Peele So, it's someone who was here now and last May 16th?
Yeah, yeah, if Woody is right.
Decided that I'm going to tell the truth, Randa.
I'm going to come clean.
Admitting an affair to the American police will cause them to investigate you.
Everyone knows that my wife and I were split way before my appointment.
I've got nothing to hide.
You're too trusting.
If you don't listen to me, Richard, you will be brought down for this.
Not unless we can find someone to be on our sides, someone like that psychic who can find the truth for us.
Are you listening to yourself?
Oh, come on, don't tell me you weren't mesmerized by that mind boggling display?
I mean, I nearly got up and cheered myself.
Shawn, I know what you're thinking.
No.
No.
No.
The spirits are stirring.
I sense I was needed.
We've had just about enough of you, Mr. Spencer.
Let's go, Shawn.
I was drawn here.
I don't know why.
Please help me find out.
Shall I ring the police?
Ooh!
Oh, that's astounding.
Please come in.
I'd like to hire you.
You can't do that.
Why?
We think you did it.
We do not.
Did before.
Dude, that was like half an hour ago.
Why did we change our mind?
Ambassador, last May 16th, you were in a strange, and fantastical place called Zurich.
It's Zurich.
So there's absolutely no way you could have killed Sarah Peele.
Of course I didn't!
I'm also sensing that you cared deeply for Annabeth.
We are paid by the Santa Barbara Police Department, Shawn.
Ambassador, go ahead.
Tell him about all the benefits that go along with working for you.
State dinners, beer pong with Prince Harry, manscaping with Charles, coral reef bombing with the Queen.
Look, I think you're mistaken.
Am I?
Oh, well, I was under the impression that there would be some kind of Diplomatic immunity.
Oh, I see.
No, it's true that all members of my staff are permitted limited powers of immunity.
Can I rob a bank?
No.
Can I print my own money?
No.
Can you introduce me to Harry Potter?
Fictional character.
Can I urinate on a public bus?
Would you want to?
Maybe.
Shawn.
Depends on the bus company.
Can I drive 180 miles per hour?
Look, I think this is all a big mistake.
You know what, scratch that, the Blueberry can only do, what, 60?
All right, I'll get you a list of exceptions.
Cheers.
You're hired.
Good enough for me.
Dude, I just got us Diplomatic immunity.
What do you want to steal?
Why do you need us, Mr. Ambassador?
Look, Annabeth was trying to contact me the night of the party.
Did she say what she wanted?
Only that it was about the case, that it was urgent.
She sent me a cryptic text.
Here.
"The witnesses were right".
Right about what?
She had just proven they were wrong.
Ambassador, I'll need a moment to evaluate your wood.
Here you go.
Oh.
Thank you.
Oh.
Where are your shoes?
Is that your British accent?
Where are you getting your accents from?
I don't know.
All the usual places, I guess.
Peter Pan, Geico Gecko, Phineas and Ferb's Granddad.
Is there any of them that don't come from animated characters?
Not really.
Does Russell Brand count?
Guys, seriously.
The shoes.
Where are they?
I don't keep my shoes here.
They weren't just shoes.
The murderer was in the room.
When?
When the, the guards came in and chased away the intruder.
I thought the killer was the intruder.
No, no, no, no.
The intruder has nothing to do with the murder.
Forget about him.
Or her.
Or it.
It's transgender.
He means the killer was a guest at the party.
If they moved the body without anyone seeing, they were probably the last to leave.
Who was that?
I know I left my jacket on the chair.
God, I had my wallet in the pocket.
Colin Hennessey, a 2010 red Chevy Cruze.
Colin Hennessey.
The kid Annabeth just cleared of murdering his girlfriend?
"The witnesses were right the first time".
Implies she knew he was guilty.
So he had to kill her before she could tell anyone else.
Ambassador, we'll need an address.
What are you doing?
Immunity doesn't cover trespassing, Shawn.
Spencer, get back out here.
You guys stay out there.
That's too sticky.
I'm going to kill him.
This time, I swear to God, I'm really going to kill him.
Carlton, you're not going to kill anyone.
I might.
May I help you?
Colin.
Colin is a 21-year-old university student.
Ah.
So you're not him.
We're his host family.
What are you doing in my home?
Well, I work for Ambassador Fanshawe and I have Diplomatic immunity.
So do I. Really?
They're just handing that out like Halloween candy.
I'm his public affairs officer.
And immunity is a very limited scope of powers.
Maybe for you.
I pretty much have the full monty.
SBPD.
May we please come in, sir?
We need to ask Colin a few questions.
Yes, of course.
Is he in some sort of trouble?
Well, he was the last guest to leave the Ambassador's party the other night and we have reason to believe the victim's body was moved late in the evening.
We also have evidence that Annabeth York had new information regarding this case.
We do?
I didn't tell you that?
Yeah.
Yeah, I divined that she was killed because she was very close to finding the murderer.
Thanks for sharing, Spencer.
Man, you really put the "Me" in team.
Colin has been a model guest in our home.
He's just resumed classes today.
I thought this awful matter was over.
It is.
We just got a fingerprint off the body and a match.
And we're going to make an arrest.
Thanks for your time.
This is preposterous.
Look, I am strongly sensing it's not her.
Her DNA was all over the body.
And she immediately invoked immunity.
You'd use it if you could get it.
It's more addictive than little crack nuggets.
And House Hunters International.
Why don't you let us talk to her?
Alone.
You moved the body?
I did it for you.
My God.
My job is to protect you and I thought that you killed her.
I mean, it was your bedroom, Richard.
Look, I'll do everything I can but your immunity's not going to help you.
I mean, The Mission are going to back the Americans on this one.
That woman wears loyalty like a micro miniskirt.
What?
That woman wears loyalty like a micro mini Wait a minute.
From his host family who stood by him this whole time.
There's no way she could have been in two places at once.
I think we had the right killer all along.
You can thank us later.
Especially me.
That's it.
That's it.
You're not driving anymore.
Oh, come on, Gus, we've almost solved the case.
We got to enjoy immunity before it's gone.
That's your idea of fun?
You know what?
You're right.
It's strangely empty.
Maybe we need to amp up the thrill.
Let's just go, Shawn.
We're not going to find anything.
Gus, don't be the mystery Mouse-ka-tool.
Hey, freeze!
Shawn Spencer, Her Majesty's Secret Service and SBPD.
He's getting away.
Gus, help me figure out which one of these cars to commandeer.
What?
Whoa!
What is that?
These are my Diplomat papers.
That is a Which Wich sandwich stamp card.
That's my Which Wich stamp card.
Which Wich is 90 miles away.
It doesn't matter, Shawn.
It is the back of the stamp card that says you work for me, signed Richard Fanshawe and I don't think I need to tell you who he is.
Yes, you do.
He's an Ambassador, Jack, which means I could kill you right now and no one could say a word, especially you because you'd be dead.
Now I'm not going to do it because I don't want to do the Queen that way, not after all the messes that Prince Andrew's gotten us into.
Man, just turn the engine back on.
Let's go get him.
The engine is on.
Really?
These Priuses are super quiet.
I am not giving you my car.
Hold up!
If you're so innocent then why did you run?
I spent four months in jail, wrongly accused.
I got scared.
I just wanted to talk to you, dude.
Then why were you shouting, "I'll shoot you repeatedly in the skull when I catch you".
That was me.
I was going to shoot him.
Only I don't have a gun.
It's just a stress relief fantasy that I have.
It's perfectly normal.
No, it's not.
Free to go.
Thank you.
Not you.
Him.
Forty-seven violations and you never even made it into a car.
Solid work, Spencer.
I have two words for you, Lassie, Diplomatic Immunity.
What, am I saying this wrong?
The guy from Lethal Weapon 2 was not Russian, Shawn.
It's been revoked.
Just got that from the Ambassador.
In my defense I never received the pamphlet outlining the limitations.
All I know is what I saw in an old CHiPS episode.
This isn't about your antics at the college.
I think he was a tad more upset about this.
So, psychic, please explain.
This is not me.
Shawn, when Lassiter showed me the picture, I said, "Where did you get that picture of Shawn"?
Look, I wish it were me if I'm being honest.
The guy looks great in a suit.
The head's all wrong and his hair has a counterclockwise trend to it.
Mine's always grown Northern hemisphere.
I don't see it.
South African.
The Lethal Weapon And this is not me.
Well, I guess there's just one way to settle this.
Okay, really?
Jules, come on.
Tell him to please stop this.
Why?
Because it's wrong, that's why.
Look, sure, I look a lot like this guy, but it's a fax.
It's blurry.
It's from the side.
Who would even send this picture?
I'm sorry, Shawn, you're on your own with this.
First question.
What is your name?
There is a murderer on the loose.
That is not your name.
Shawn Spencer.
Truth.
We're off to a good start.
Where were you the night of the party?
Let's see, I talked with Gus.
Played some videogames.
Yeah, we were talking a little Star Wars.
Look, Lassie, we both know what this is about.
This is about me and Juliet.
Answer only my questions, please.
Yes, we're together.
You hate it.
I get it.
Spencer.
I can't help it, man.
Spencer.
I've been fighting this thing for years.
Spencer, stop.
Stop!
It's not just going to go away.
You're just going to have to deal with the fact that I love her, okay?
Hmm.
All right.
Can I get out of here?
I've just about solved this case.
One more question.
If it will make you happy.
I think it will.
Are you psychic?
Excuse me?
Are you, Shawn Spencer, psychic?
You have to answer that one, Shawn.
Yes.
No deception indicated.
Hold it.
Hold it.
I repeat.
Are you psychic?
Yes, I am.
A person of psychic ability.
I am.
With the ability to see into the future.
I am.
I'm so psychic I can't even believe it.
You want to try it in Spanish?
You just said that you were legless.
You're legless.
This is not me.
This is a guy with similar hair and no idea how to style it.
Okay, I think we've heard about enough of this, Carlton.
Oh, and I know who killed that woman if anyone is interested.
The least you could do is give us an explanation.
You wouldn't need one if you'd keep your criminals in the cell a little longer.
What's going on, guys?
Why don't you tell me, Colin?
The photo that was faxed to the Ambassador, came from this house.
Which got me to thinking, who stands to benefit the most from discrediting me?
The correct answer is the killer.
Annabeth was my savior.
She found the witness that cleared me.
Why would I do anything to harm her?
Maybe she realized she was wrong and you actually were guilty?
But she wasn't wrong, was she?
What are you doing here?
Charles and I are old friends.
I see you.
I sense you, Wignall, at the party, in the closet, hiding, after you strangled Annabeth York.
Annabeth came to you at the party.
She had news but couldn't get a hold of the Ambassador.
She sent me a cryptic text.
Here.
"The witnesses were right".
She had to tell someone she knew.
Someone she worked with.
Perhaps an old friend.
Unfortunately, you realized that she was very close to discovering that Colin was imprisoned for doing something that you were guilty of.
You had to kill her to keep her quiet.
Charles, tell me that isn't true.
I didn't.
Annabeth knew the witnesses were right about the car.
They were just wrong about the driver.
You had access to Colin's keys.
And you had a creepy fascination with his girlfriend.
I barely knew who she was.
That's not true.
Sarah mentioned that you'd called her on her mobile more than once.
Eventually she wouldn't come over here.
She always wanted to meet at her place.
I didn't know why but now it makes sense.
Don't start pointing the finger at me because of this lunatic who's clearly a fake.
Oh!
I'm sensing that you, Colin, misplaced a collection of voyeuristic photos, but, wait!
Luckily, Mrs. Wignall found them for you.
Spiritual correction incoming, are these even yours?
I've never seen these before.
Are you sure?
I'm in them.
It's very easy to mistake someone in a photo.
Look.
That's my shirt.
Well, ah, if they're not yours, then who could they possibly I'm getting something very dark and very "Wignall-y-ian".
Richard, tell them.
Look, you've had your issues with young women before.
You, sir, strangled Annabeth York and you, sir, strangled Sarah Peele.
She was a liar.
A mad little I don't have to stand for this questioning.
I work with the Ambassador and you know what that means.
I've got Diplomatic Keep your mouth shut!
You're fired!
Sir, put your hands behind your back.
I know how you know.
So you're pleading guilty then?
Now you're absolutely sure I can't hold on to my title just until April 16th.
You still have to pay taxes, you know, Shawn?
Yeah, but I could pay British taxes, which are probably way cheaper, right?
Oh, you really don't know anything about the UK, do you?
Just the good stuff.
Morrissey, Gwyneth Paltrow, leprechauns I'm going to miss you, Shawn.
Oh, you know you ever need me at the Embassy, I'm right here That's never going to happen.
Thank you.
Ambassador, I have one last vision.
It's about your son.
He's in danger, I'm afraid.
Serious danger of becoming a real A-hole.
You don't have to be a psychic to know that, but thank you.
I appreciate it.
Oh, yes.
Americans are so emotional.
Could you bring the bags?
Of course.
Should we talk about what happened yesterday?
No.
No, no, not really.
Spencer, may I have a word?
O'Hara.
What?
Oh, come on, Lassie, we're not really going to do this again, are we?
I've known you for six years, Spencer.
I know your act.
You do your little dance, you beat polygraph machines, you always manage to guess the right culprit after missing the first four or five times.
You whip that hair around and fall over every reasonable girl that Guster hasn't unsuccessfully hit on already.
And now you've made your way to O'Hara.
Oh, come on.
It's not like that.
When I first met you, you outed my relationship with my former partner.
A girl I really liked, by the way.
Got her transferred.
That doesn't matter now.
My point is, if you don't treat O'Hara with the respect she deserves or if you hurt her in any way, I will discharge my pistol.
You're saying you'll shoot me?
Repeatedly.
The answer is No.
Wrong again.
Shawn, I knew you were lying.
You have to believe the lie.
Don't sweat.
Feel your heart.
Dad, this feels a little unethical.
Trust me, Shawn, there will come a day, unfortunately, when this might be necessary.
Perhaps you'll be working undercover.
But most likely not.
Now answer the question again, but this time, first, breathe.
No.
Perfect.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Please explain to me again what we're doing here as opposed to doing anything else in the world.
We're paying respects to a man who dedicated his life's work to the police department, Shawn.
Oh, please, you don't know Jim.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Woody.
When is the pinata coming out?
Oh, I don't know that there is a pinata, I don't think so.
Oh.
I was told this was a party.
Okay, well, as fun as this is, I think I'm going to scoot.
No.
You're leaving?
What about Jim?
I don't even know Jim.
Plus I have to work on the DA's case.
Lassiter and I have to testify in court tomorrow.
Lassiter's still here.
Lassiter's sleeping.
You want me to come with you?
Please say yes.
Uh, hold up there.
Looks like I might need me a wing-man.
Oh, my God.
You don't care about Jim Dubois.
You disgust me.
You make me sick to my face.
I have a girlfriend.
She's standing right here.
It's true.
I am.
Oh, they're both for me.
You don't have enough game for half of one of those women.
Please.
I've got game.
Have fun.
Yeah.
All right, that's it.
What are you doing?
I'm getting this party started.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention for a moment please?
Tam and Jim, you had a long career, my man.
Perhaps the longest of all time.
You touched us all right here, a little bit up here.
Just a teeny weeny bit down Shawn.
And you put away a bunch of bad guys at the same time.
He worked a desk job.
He never fired his weapon.
With your bare hands and your off hours, and now, Jim, you can ride off into the sunset and spend some quality time with your mom here.
That is his wife.
To Jim, damn it.
To Jim.
Hey bartender, how about a round of shots on the department?
Gus.
Oh.
Gus.
Oh.
What?
What?
I'm ready.
Let's go.
What?
What?
Man, I think we slept here.
What happened last night?
Strangely I have no idea.
Wait.
Nothing.
Weird.
Disjointed.
My finger to eyebrow device is broken.
That's never happened to me before.
My memory is completely blank.
Shawn, why is there a shower cap on your head?
I'm sure there's a very easy explanation for this.
Is there an easy explanation as to why you're wearing sandals that aren't yours?
Where are my Nikes?
And why are you wearing a gold chain, Shawn?
- Huh.
- Oh.
What the hell?
Oh, dear Lord, please tell me this is a dream.
Calm down, peaches.
Come back to bed.
Whatever you think happened last night didn't happen because nothing happened, you got it?
That's nice, Lassie.
Way to belittle the man.
Yeah, Detective.
I do have feelings.
What's all over your face?
I can't be sure.
Oh, God.
You didn't see a small Colombian with a hook for an arm, did you?
No.
No?
Oh, why do you have a black eye?
Okay, it's nothing to freak out about.
Everybody relax.
It's not a big deal.
It's just a small shiner.
Lassie is absolutely right.
His lover's spat with Woody is really none of our business.
I should call my wife.
No.
We don't keep secrets.
Nobody's calling anybody!
Uh-oh.
My baby!
Son It's missing three bullets.
I can tell by the weight.
It's three light.
It's been fired.
Uh, shouldn't someone start freaking out right now?
Wait a minute, what's this?
Looks like I made some sort of video last night.
Who's that guy in a horrible Hawaiian shirt?
I have no idea.
Shawn?
I told you, I'm broken.
I got nothing.
Stugots.
How is it all of us can't remember a single thing from last night?
Strode.
Right.
I just got told to come back to the office.
It's urgent.
I just got the same call.
Where's my keys?
I don't see my car out there.
My Ford Fusion is missing!
Now can we all start freaking out?
Ah!
Everyone, relax!
We'll take the Blueberry and we will ride calmly, eloquently and professionally, like gentlemen.
Nice parking job, Guster.
How do you even know he was driving?
Okay, if no one else is going to freak out, then I will.
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my God!
Do you see my car?
Do you see my car?
It's just a minor ding, buddy.
You can only see it because the sun's hitting at that angle.
Isn't that right, Woody?
I don't feel right inside.
Oh, my gosh!
I can't believe this!
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my God!
Do you see my car?
Do you see my car?
Okay, we have a male John Doe, Caucasian, forties Detective Lassiter, why are you wearing sunglasses at an autopsy?
I Chief, if I may?
Lassie spoke to us all about a week ago about wearing sunglasses to all autopsies moving forward to show respect for the dead.
Yeah.
I simply forgot and Gus refused because he has no value for human life.
The body was dredged from the water near Arroyo Beach late this morning.
Shot three times.
It's missing three bullets.
I can tell by the weight.
Um, how many times?
Three.
Why?
Mmm-mmm.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know So any time a John Doe rolls in, it becomes a top priority.
Someone out there murdered this person.
And without an identity we have no clues to go on.
But it's our responsibility to get to the bottom of this and bring the perp in and bring them to justice.
Now I want to start with any open missing persons cases that the vic's identity might match.
Now, on site, floating near the vicinity of the body, CSI was able to pull out only these few items.
We have a watch, an empty wallet and a pair of shoes, which are not even the victim's correct size.
I'd like all hands on deck for this but because you and O'Hara are due to testify in court in four hours You know what?
That's okay, Chief, O'Hara can go.
I don't need to be there.
She was actually the one who was going to testify.
I was just going to lend my presence for the jury.
Seriously?
Dead serious.
Yes, no.
I mean, yes, there's a dead man here and it is tragic, awful but I can handle it.
Plus I've got Shawn and Gus to help.
I'm sorry, you are requesting to work with Shawn and Gus?
What is going on?
And please take those sunglasses off.
You put some sunglasses on!
Why would I put sunglasses on?
Okay, look, um, he's actually right, O'Hara.
Let's let these guys run with this and then you can just join up after you testify.
All right, Woody, let's get to work.
Shawn?
Mmm?
A word.
What the hell was going on in there?
I was about to ask you the same thing.
You seem grumps.
I'm not grumps.
Who's grumps?
Shawn, I didn't get any sleep last night.
Aren't you going to say anything about the phone call you made to me?
It's kind of a huge deal.
Phone call?
Yes.
Of course.
Obviously.
It is huge, isn't it?
Does Gus know about this?
Why wouldn't he?
Something of this magnitude.
It's huge and we need to talk about it but wouldn't you agree I should get back in there right now?
Okay.
All right.
Yes.
Yes.
But, Shawn let's talk.
Yes.
Let's.
And soon.
This is big.
This is a game-changer.
For everyone.
Game-changer!
Talk soon.
What the hell happened last night?
Are those doors shut?
Yeah.
Okay, I think I'm going to turn myself in.
What, for spooning with Woody?
We did nothing wrong.
Look, guys, we have some of the finest crime-solving minds in the world right here in this room.
Now I think you bought us a few hours to figure out what happened here before we go sounding off any alarms.
Lassie, I need you to look inwards.
Take a swim in Lake You.
See what you see.
We can do this.
Spencer, I can't survive without the facts.
I don't know what happened last night.
I've never lost control of my faculties in my life.
Me neither.
Unless I'm being tickled.
Then all bets are off.
What about me, fellows?
I'm not having any psychic visions!
Flashbacks or recreation flashbacks or recreation flashbacks with new psychic visions.
I mean imagine you weren't just a bland, gangly, average human, huh?
That you could wink at someone and and and light up their world.
That you could make a child think that you have given them an ice cream cone without giving them the cone!
And then watch them skip off into a beautiful meadow licking nothing but air!
Imagine that!
Imagine that you have a special gift, a sixth sense and then someone or something comes along and rips it away from you.
Imagine that, Jack!
Do you see me giving up?
Okay, Shawn, okay.
Damn it, I cannot believe I am saying this but, men, we are in this together.
Obviously we knew the victim.
Well, we all knew the victim but you were the one who shot him.
You had the dead guy's phone.
Shawn was wearing the man's sandals.
Huh.
I was hoping you guys didn't notice that.
Look, I don't care if we did kill this guy.
I'm just happy to be a part of it.
Do not touch me again.
Guster, give me your phone.
It's evidence.
I need my phone.
I'm the only one here with a day job.
I need it for work.
I am in charge and calling the shots.
It is evidence.
Put it in.
Fine.
All right, fine, you can hang on to the phone but it never comes out of the bag.
Do you understand?
I got it.
There's only one thing we should do at this point.
We all have to pee into a cup.
Amen.
That is an excellent idea.
I couldn't agree more.
There's obviously only one reason that none of us remember what happened last night, we were drugged.
That is also a possibility.
Hey, I'll run some tests!
See what turns up.
Yes, I will hold.
Just tell him to hurry up.
Do you remember me calling Jules last night?
You called Juliet last night?
Apparently.
You don't think I told her about Lassie shooting his gun?
I certainly hope not.
I've got to look at that dead guy's phone.
Well, take a look at it.
I need you to get down there, pretend like you're tying your shoe.
I'm not doing that.
You do it.
I can't.
Why not?
I don't have any laces.
So?
So, what am I supposed to tie, your face?
Fine.
McNab, finally, put your listening ears on.
I need you to put out an official APB on a black Ford Fusion.
Yes, I'm aware that I drive a black Ford Fusion.
McNab, would you just do what I ask you please?
No, I am not I don't remember the license plate off the top of my head.
Thank you.
Why is it always so difficult with you?
No, I don't really want to go to lunch today.
Rain check.
I am sensing that our victim was some kind of stalker.
Stalker?
Yeah, I get a vision of a blond woman, attractive in a soccer mom sort of way.
Kind of Teri Garr-esque.
Okay.
First off, I didn't realize peyote stayed in your system that many years.
I have only myself, and my then girlfriend, Lollipop, to blame.
Secondly, Guster, your cholesterol is really high.
Man, I told you eating something called, "Stick of butter in a bun" was a bad idea.
I can't help it, Shawn.
My body craves buttery goodness.
You're buttery.
You know that's right.
Act natural.
All right, now, here's the skinny.
We all copious amounts of Salvia divinorum in our systems.
That's a psychoactive herb that can cause hallucinations and dissociative effects.
We were all drugged at that bar.
I knew it.
However, our victim had no trace of the drug at all.
He was clean.
Why would someone spike our drink but not his?
Well, clearly someone was trying to take advantage of us, sexually.
Or at least me.
Not last night, Lassie.
Or this last decade.
I am sensing that we were the recipients of drugs that were intended for a pair of women.
All right, let's hit that bar.
Yeah, let's shake them down.
What?
No shakedown?
Carlton Lassiter, SBPD.
I got some hard questions, I need some straight answers.
Has anyone turned in some Ford Fusion keys?
Or actually the Ford Fusion itself?
No.
Damn it.
Hey, man, you recognize that guy?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, he was here last night.
But why are you guys asking me?
I mean, you're best friends with the dude.
Buying him drinks all night.
Uh, I wasn't buying some sandal-wearing white guy a bunch of drinks, okay?
That's not me.
This guy was sucking back soda water and limes.
Ah-hah.
That's why he didn't have drugs in his system.
You know, I'm really starting to like this cop stuff.
When are we going to plant some evidence on this guy?
Stop breathing on my neck.
That's just how I breathe.
Would you give me some personal space?
I'll give you whatever you need.
I'm getting something!
I'm seeing a guy, he's like a Swedish version of Jon Cryer.
Long blond hair, earring, completely different bone structure though and very short.
Small man.
Yeah, I know who that is.
You do?
Yeah, he does.
Yeah, that's Mikey.
He's my partner.
Mikey.
Mikey?
Yep.
You, baby Thor.
It was you.
You were the one that was trying to pick up on those girls last night.
You tried to spike their drinks and you accidentally drugged ours.
Yeah, I don't think Mikey here was trolling for women.
Oh.
Hmm.
Yeah, so much for that vision.
It's all right, Spencer.
I got this.
No, Lassie, you Would you let me do my job?
So, partners, huh?
You guys own this place together?
Um, no.
No, Lassie.
What, do you got a little side business going, huh?
Lassie.
What?
What?
They're a couple, man.
They're together.
He's not our suspect because they're lovers in the nighttime.
He can't quit him.
Oh.
Oh.
Just so you know, me and this guy, we spooned last night.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm going to look for my keys.
I'll help.
Oh, good Lord.
Excuse me, I think I left my credit card here last night.
Oh, my God.
My God!
I told you, you wouldn't stay away from me.
You and I?
Yeah, but then you took off.
Don't do that again.
Now, what are you doing for the rest of the day?
Give me one second.
Two baby ones, maybe.
Okay.
Hurry back.
I will.
Last night, Gus had some serious game.
I'll be damned.
I think I owe you an apology.
She wants me to bounce, Shawn.
I'm going to bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, no!
No.
We're in the middle of an investigation.
Shawn, I don't care.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Come on, bounce, come on, bounce, bounce, bounce A man died!
Fine.
I really, really, really want to take off right now but my friends and I are in an investigation of sorts.
An investigation?
Hmm.
Sounds sexy.
It is.
Why don't you give me your phone and I'll put my digits in it?
All seven of them.
Guster, what did I say?
Oh!
I'm sorry.
I can't let anyone touch this right now.
It's evidence in our case.
It's kind of a big deal.
You know, sexy.
Uh-huh.
Let me put it in.
Through the plastic?
Sure.
All right.
I got it!
Everybody!
I got it.
It's it's good.
This is What are you doing?
I'm looking for my keys.
Those things are expensive to replace.
But double good news, I know where we went when we left the bar last night and, uh, Woody, you don't have a cocaine problem.
Shawn, right now I'm missing an opportunity to capitalize on Last Night's Gus's game.
Which I told you I had.
Well, Today Gus is a whiney baby and we're here for a case and it's not solving the mystery of your darkened loins.
This is it?
A freaking donut shop?
Stay with me, Lassie.
These donuts have something to do with our case.
I promise you that.
Ow.
Move!
Jesus.
Oh, I'm sensing this guy's going to help us fill in some blanks.
Oh, no, no, no!
Not you guys again.
Uh-uh.
No way.
I told you.
Look, I already told you and made it perfectly clear I don't know that woman.
Well, I'm sensing that you do know that woman, that she was here, you two were face to face.
What are you, psychic?
No, he's not.
Yes, he is.
Okay, fine, she was here like two days ago, but she just bought some bear claws.
I didn't sleep with her.
We asked you if you slept with her?
Come on.
Look at me.
Does it look like I'm going around trying to bed a bunch of blond Desperate Housewife types?
Like that's my thing?
Because they can't get enough of this?
I'm drawn to you in a weird sort of way.
Maybe they recognize you from Children of the Corn.
Maybe they know you from The Cosby Show, Bud.
I'm not Bud!
Did we ask you anything else?
Uh, no, you were too busy trying on everybody else's shoes.
And the angry one stole my donut hat.
Why is he looking at me?
I'm not the angry guy.
You are pretty angry.
Our victim wasn't a stalker!
He wasn't following the woman because he was into her, he was on a case.
He was hired to do so.
He was on the job?
He was a private investigator.
That's probably why we befriended him.
We were helping him.
I'm pretty sure I was hooking up at the time.
What?
No, that makes total sense.
It's a simple snap and shoot adultery case.
I can solve that in my sleep.
We were helping him look for the woman.
We were feeling generous.
That's what it was.
I had the munchies.
I should poop.
Are we allowed to take a bathroom break?
Oh, I should have gone at the bar.
You owe me $31 because you licked the sugar off all the powdered donuts.
Like a weird sicko.
Oh.
Oh, this is good.
This feels good.
This is great.
We finally have a handle on what happened last night!
Hey!
You killed Bobo!
Or there could still be a few details floating around out there.
Okay, just take it easy.
Nobody killed anybody.
Actually Lassie might have killed somebody.
Bobo's dead.
You're going to pay.
Who the hell is Bobo?
Come on.
I'm head detective of the Santa Barbara Police Department.
You better have some very serious evidence if you're going to accuse me of vandalism like that.
You're idiots.
It's old school.
There, see?
I didn't kill anybody!
Robert, you son of a bitch.
Back up.
That jerk took us out.
Uh, uh, not so fast.
Now who is that guy?
So that's how Lassie got the black eye.
Bobo.
I am sorry for your loss.
Hello?
Guten Tag.
There's been another body.
I just got verified on Twitter.
Oh, that's nice, man.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Okay, here we are again.
This is Scott Williams, age forty-four, Caucasian.
Found dead in his car off Santa Viego Drive.
That's right down the block from Bobo's Donuts.
What bearing does that have, Mr. Guster?
Fun fact!
Gus is making a book of them.
Is that the same guy that punched Lassie?
Yes, it is.
Lacerations on the victim's knuckles indicate he may have been involved in a physical altercation prior to his death.
I can do a skin test.
Now if those knuckles made contact with someone's face, we will find DNA in the cuts.
Woody!
Or not.
Or not.
DNA is hardly conclusive.
It is really sketchy at best.
Woody, what can you tell us?
Based on skin color and blood coagulation, I'd say this guy's been dead for no more than nine hours.
I'd put his TOD somewhere between 1:45 and 2:30.
Throw out another fun fact.
Why would I do that?
Just Don't do that.
Do it.
Fine.
Chief Vick.
Hmm?
Did you know that more people are killed by donkeys annually than die in air crashes?
I am sensing that our John Doe from this morning and Mr. Williams here are connected.
I think they knew each other.
Okay, well, that is at least a lead.
Uh, Detective Lassiter, O'Hara is back on the case.
You two should Terrific.
You two should follow Mr. Spencer's scent over to Mr. William's residence.
Okay?
All right, let's do it.
Not you, Shawn.
Okay.
Don't we have to talk about last night?
Now?
Here?
I mean yes.
I mean, you drop this huge, shocking information over the phone and then you just expect me to keep it a secret?
I'm sorry.
I don't.
I did.
I just I don't want you to worry about it, you know?
I'm trying to take care of this thing myself.
Well, it's not just about you, Shawn.
It's about us.
I mean we're in this together and we have to trust each other.
I agree.
You're so right.
It's just we've been dancing around this thing all day.
No one will just, you know, come out with it.
I think we should lay it all on the line.
Let the cards fall where they may, even if it destroys lives in the process.
You asked me to move in with you.
Lassie killed Williams.
Lassiter killed Williams?
Move in?
We've only been together for like four months.
Again, Lassiter killed this man?
I don't think he did.
Not anymore.
I'll explain on the way.
We've got to get to his house.
Wait, so all of that happened last night?
How could you keep that from me?
Which one of these houses is Teri Hatcher's?
I'm not keeping stuff from you.
I just don't remember what happened.
I expect someone to come around every corner saying, "Not you again".
Don't do it, ma'am.
Please don't.
So if you technically don't remember asking me, do you still want to move in?
Are you kidding me?
Of course I do.
Of course.
Why else would I be shrink-wrapping all my old sweaters to make room in the closet for yours?
I just think you like to shrink wrap things.
It's true.
It's fun to watch things shrink.
She just texted me again.
She can't get enough of me.
I just want to know what line Last Night Gus laid on her.
I need Last Night Gus, Shawn.
Man, I've got my own problems.
Last Night Shawn was all evolved and mature and not a commitment-phobe.
Today Shawn is very much a commitment-phobe.
All right, we're dealing with a single guy, possibly a loner.
Dobson, you start shaking down all his co-workers.
I want this place dusted and processed in the next hour.
Let's go!
All right, there is no way a straight single guy picked out those drapes.
I like those drapes, Shawn.
They're stately.
Okay, how many guys you know pee sitting down?
I pee sitting down, Shawn.
All the men's health journals say it's better for your circulation.
Remember when we talked about inside voice?
I'm using my inside voice.
Okay, now it's time to learn about no voice.
All right, you cannot possibly tell me that you keep potpourri in your underwear drawer.
There was a woman here.
Williams does not live alone.
Look what I found in the trash.
Somebody put their fist through this picture.
I'll be damned.
That blond is the woman in the photos in the phone.
She's Williams' wife.
He hired the PI to find evidence of her cheating.
She found out he was doing this And she killed them both.
If this is true then we are dealing with one cold-blooded killer.
We better find her before more bodies start piling up.
This was way easier when we thought Lassie was the murderer.
I'm just saying.
Tom Wopat's office.
Dad, calm down.
Shawn, I don't know why I'm here but I woke up in some strange motel room that I apparently trashed.
Oh, man, I screwed up really bad.
Is it the Suncrest Motel?
What?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
How'd you know that?
And then the angry guy stole my donut hat.
Oh, man.
I know what happened.
You were with us last night.
Tell me, do you see a donut hat laying around anywhere there?
What?
Yes, I do.
Oh, my God, Dad, you're the angry one.
Blonde, five-foot-seven, a hundred and twenty-five pounds.
Shawn, I think I ordered a lady of the night.
Dad, that's the woman the private eye was tailing.
We must have landed there because we thought she was showing up.
What private eye?
I'll explain when I get there.
Shawn, I'm not wearing any pants.
Dad, sit tight.
Shawn, come alone.
I have a very strong vision about another place we may have been last night.
This one does not involve food so please bring snacks if you are peckish.
I just want to get home and forget this whole thing ever happened.
After we go to the front desk and pay for that towel.
I'm not going to be an accomplice to your petty theft.
Hey, what?
Hey!
I told you to come alone.
Look, Dad, we're very close to solving this thing, okay?
We need them.
Carlton, Gus, Juliet.
What the hell happened to you?
Huh?
Oh, oh, Shawn called me up, told me you guys were working on a case, tying up some loose ends, so I decided to rush down here Oh, hell with it.
Screw it.
I guess I slept here last night.
Wait a minute, you were here too?
Wait, you weren't in Gus's car with us.
Who drove you here?
I know who.
Shawn, are you getting a vision?
It's not exactly a vision, uh I don't want to be here anymore.
I guess I was in no condition to drive.
Do you even know Jim?
Jim who?
You guys again.
Oh, Christ.
Whoa.
You owe me 480 bucks.
What?
That that is not a floatation device.
All right, you know what?
This is getting ridiculous.
I am head detective of the Santa Barbara Police Department and we were here last night on an official police investigation and I hardly think we were pulling juvenile stunts.
I have security video if you'd like to watch it for yourself.
You said 480?
Right?
That broad you were waiting for last night, she finally showed up this morning.
In fact she might still be here.
She never checked out.
Can you lead us to her room?
Can you give me the check?
What is this?
Shawn.
I'm sorry.
Whoever she was having the affair with was here with her.
Oh, my God.
Everybody get out of here!
Take cover!
Does someone want to explain to me what the hell happened last night?
Okay, I just want to go on record and say that I was on that couch first.
I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.
Whoa, excuse excuse me.
May I help you?
My beef ain't with you, lady.
I need to talk to these two cats right here.
Mother of God.
It's Ed Lover.
Mr. Spencer, what is Ed Lover doing in my office?
I guess your mother never taught you about taking another grown-ass man's bling.
Wait, that's your bling?
That's my brand, player.
Dude, you took Ed Lover's bling.
I don't remember doing it.
I swear.
Come on, son.
You know damn well you swiped my ultra bright while I was on the dance floor getting my freak on.
Who the hell is Ed Lover?
Come on, son!
I apologize for my Dad's life.
Shawn and I are huge fans, Mr. Ed Lover.
In case we didn't mention it last night.
Huh.
I should whip both your narrow asses.
Wasted half my day tracking you down.
Come on, son.
Get the F out of here with that bull Did that Was he What a night.
What a night.
Okay, please tell me that that is going to be the last interruption.
Now, people What's up, baby?
Listen, Mr. Guster, we're all happy that you can manage to captivate the honeys or whatever it is but right now you are on my time.
Can you hold on one second?
Actually, Chief, I'm on my time.
I almost lost my life an hour ago and I'm sick of it.
Last Night Gus had it right and I don't want to sit here wasting another moment when I could be living the life I was meant to live.
Balling and shot-calling.
So if you don't mind, I'm going to keep it one hundy and take this call.
Hey, buddy Sorry, Shawn, it's hard out there for a pimp.
It's true, Chief.
He's got to make money for the rent.
I'm not even going to bring up the destruction of Bobo the donut man.
Uh, Chief, if I may, in lieu of flowers, donations can be made to glazedforlife.
Com.
Ow!
I'll get you!
Stop it!
I will destroy you!
You know what?
This is not a joke, Mr. Spencer!
That explosion was meant to kill and the killer is still out there.
And Henry Spencer, where are you pants?
I'm not entirely sure, Karen.
Her name is Gloria Williams, Chief, and she couldn't have gotten far.
We have contacted every transportation agency in an effort to slow her down.
Then what are we doing still sitting here?
And then it hit me, the calculated way in which these murders were committed, the fire bomb ambush at the motel, the fact that Gloria Williams has managed to disappear without a trace.
This does not fit the profile of your typical suburban housewife.
I'm so bored.
Now we've been concentrating on her but I don't think she's capable of this.
We should be focusing on the men that she was in the photographs with.
One of them could be our killer.
We can eliminate the donut guy.
He sold her some donuts.
That's the hotel manager so we know he was photographed when she was checking in.
Valet.
Grocery bagger.
Hair stylist.
Who's that guy?
Whoa, hold up!
I can't help it, Shawn.
My body craves buttery goodness.
We need to see Dwayne.
Who's Dwayne?
Dwayne, my man, we just don't see enough of you.
That's because nobody ever utilizes my skill set.
They forget about me.
Literally they locked me in here over the holiday weekend.
I survived on the moisture of my desk cactus and Girl Scout cookies.
God, that's horrible.
I know.
Spencer, why are we here?
Oh, right, okay.
Here we go.
We're going to lose the cleft chin on the guy in the cafe.
Thank you, sir.
Uh, now let's get rid of the wrinkles on his forehead.
Perfect.
Now we want to take the long hair and the beard and mustache off the mug shot.
Ladies and gentlemen and Dwayne, I give you Mr. Leroy Jenkins!
Holy crap.
This guy's responsible for over 37 armed robberies throughout the southwest.
He killed several security guards.
Nobody's gotten a picture of this guy in the last 25 years.
He's remained absolutely invisible.
Jenkins wasn't worried about the repercussions of sleeping with a married woman, but some low grade private eye that might have pictures of him on his phone, now that could expose his whereabouts.
Wait a minute, everyone, just wait a minute.
You're telling me that one of the most wanted guys in the state is going to walk right into a bar full of cops and try to get a cell phone.
I'm sensing he had a partner.
Pull up his Most Wanted page.
Stats, aliases, nothing.
Wait, next of kin, blow that up.
His only known relative, an adopted daughter, Lilly Jenkins.
Oh!
That's the girl.
That's the girl from the bar last night that Gus supposedly hooked up with only younger and cuter and less murderer-y.
Oh, man, that means Last Night Gus did not have the game he thought he did.
Where's Guster now?
Well, here's the crib.
Nothing too fancy.
You know just the basics, couch, brand new 46 inch plasma, me.
So he sent his daughter into the bar to get the phone and the pictures from the private eye.
She wasn't planning on befriending a bunch of cops so she drugged us to get to the PI alone, got him alone, he had Gus's phone.
She thought Gus had the private eye's phone that had the pictures on it.
That's why she's trying to hook up with him all day.
Wait a minute, whose car are we taking?
To the beginning of something we should have done last night.
There it is.
I can't believe Gus was so careless to fall for some girl's hustle.
Look, Jules, I don't think anyone should be held accountable for anything they said last night, okay?
Whether it was murdering people or just speaking out of turn.
So you're telling me you're convinced that the daughter killed these two men?
No, I can see the confrontation with the PI.
It didn't go well.
Lilly had to call in her father to do the dirty work.
The husband, Scott Williams, he knew about the photos so he had to go too.
You know what I like about you?
Hmm?
You have eyes.
Yes, I do.
Two of them.
Two of them, yes.
Will you excuse me to freshen up?
Sure.
Hello, friend.
Hello.
You're a tough little fellow to track down.
Wipey.
Wipey.
Without your friends, I don't think you're going to be giving me any trouble now, are you?
I have just one question for you.
What's that?
Where's the phone?
Where's the phone?
Where is the phone?
Where is the phone?
Where's the phone?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, do you not see the lights?
Hey boss, isn't that your Ford Fusion?
- You're the bartender.
- You son of a bitch!
McNab, go, go, go!
Carlton!
I will kill you!
I'll kill you!
Stop repeating everything I'm saying.
Stop repeating everything I'm saying.
You're not getting it, are you?
I have a gun pointed at your head and I will shoot you unless you give me that phone.
Can I squish your face?
He will shoot you.
He's going to shoot you?
No, you.
Wow, you were in the bathroom for a really long time.
Drop your gun, Jenkins!
Easy.
Easy.
Don't shoot Gus!
Tell him to take cover!
Gus, take cover, buddy!
Oh, my God, somebody shot that guy's TV.
That's your TV.
What?
This dude has taffy.
I love taffy.
Gus, this guy is trying to kill us.
He is bad.
We are good.
Good job, buddy.
Uh, this dude has a gun.
Yes, he does.
A big one.
Look, don't drown them.
Just powder them, okay?
Good.
Donald, do you like to samba?
What the hell's wrong with this guy?
Don't even think about licking that.
It's not really gender specific, is it?
No.
You know, as much as this pains me deeply to say, thank you.
For what?
For helping us get through this whole ordeal and also believing that I didn't kill someone.
Gus was pretty sure you did kill someone.
I still am.
Don't worry, Lassie, you'll kill someone some day.
Now come on, let's spoon it up.
Come on, we'll make it right half-moon style.
Oh, this is not going to be easy with Jules.
Any chance you can channel Last Night Gus to tell me how to handle this?
Please.
Turns out Last Night Gus is very similar to Today Gus.
I'm not ready.
I understand.
You just have to be man enough to tell her you want to live alone.
It's that simple.
You're right.
I know.
You tell her.
Come on, son.
Get out of here with that bull.
All right.
All right.
What Shawn!
Okay.
All right.
Hey.
Hi.
Hey, so listen, I've been doing a lot of thinking about our conversation.
Me too.
You have?
Of course.
Look, I don't want the future us to be dictated by something that Last Night Shawn said.
So if you can look me in the eye and tell me that Today Shawn definitely wants to move in That's what I thought.
No, no, no, I was I was about to say yes.
No, you weren't.
I was.
I was just going to use an accent and I was waffling between Scottish and Gaelic.
And the differences are very subtle.
It's fine.
The fact that any version of Shawn wanted to move in is Minty?
I was going to say romantic.
Really?
So you're not terribly disappointed in me.
Look, I'm just saying that it doesn't have to happen right now.
Today.
Does that make sense?
I understand.
Okay.
You're an incredible slob.
Oh.
A hoarder, right?
And you just live amidst stacks and stacks of periodicals and taxidermy.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
You were ready to move in with me.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Maybe Last Night Shawn has more in common with Today Shawn than Today Shawn thinks.
What?
Don't judge me.
I'm not judging.
You have a stuffed meerkat in your home.
What?
And you don't use toilet paper.
Okay, well you can give me some of yours.
That's all you have!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Whoa!
What's your poison?
Humanity.
Bad day in the universe, huh?
Yeah, they all sort of run together.
Unless a corpse resurfaces in a boggy creek, or I liquidate some nut-loving rodentia.
Oh, uh, Jack Daniels.
Rocks.
I'll have what he's having.
I hope you weren't saving this stool for somebody else.
Do I know you?
Or do you think I'm someone else?
To the night.
So what's your story, Carlton?
How do you know my name?
I asked you first.
Are you a prostitute?
Is that the vibe I'm giving off?
Sorry, no.
I'm just, um, I don't know, just a little Lonely?
Yeah.
Maybe just a little bit.
So are you going to tell me about yourself or not?
Yep.
Well, you already know my name.
I come here to unwind because my job can be intense.
I often dream I'm Clint Eastwood.
Even in Bloodwork?
Mostly Heartbreak Ridge.
Please continue.
I am somewhat recently divorced.
I believe there's little to no room for interpretation when it comes to the United States Constitution and I have an usually high threshold for pain.
That is a very unusual necklace and it shows off your clavicle quite well.
For all eternity.
Your turn.
Okay, um, I'm about as single as they come.
And I really like a man with hair on his chest.
And as for Clint, I really think it's Unforgiven.
Your eyes are swimmable.
Why is your job so intense?
How did you know my name?
Why don't you hold that thought while I go freshen up?
We're going to need more whiskey.
Maybe she's on the phone.
Did you ever think of that?
Maybe she's with a guy.
Come on!
There's people waiting here!
Hey, you blind, Flat Stanley?
Get.
You got to be kidding me.
Listen, Jules, don't beat yourself up.
You can't possibly be expected to control whether or not Gus and I surreptitiously follow you after you get a call during breakfast.
But I specifically told you not to follow.
She said "Farrow".
"Farrow" is not a word.
I said "follow".
He knows I said "follow".
I wasn't there but "farrow" is most definitely a word.
Thank you.
It means to birth a calf or a litter of pigs.
Okay, fine, why would I ask Shawn not to birth a calf or a litter of pigs?
I don't know.
What you got?
Male, early 30s, now, CSI is on their way but I'd The girl, McNab!
What did you find out about the girl I met last night?
I might need a little bit more to go on, sir.
What do you need?
What more do you need?
I told you she's blond, and pale, and perfect, and beautiful and perfect.
So get me a name, and get me an address.
And get me some aspirin.
Please tell me why they're at my crime scene.
Oh, Lassie, it is not Jules' fault.
She told me not to follow her and I thought she was telling me not to be pregnant with swine.
Are you okay?
I haven't beaten you to a call in six years.
Of course I'm okay.
Why wouldn't I be okay?
I just had to stop for gas.
All right.
See if you got a wallet.
The name of the deceased is Hamilton Deane, lives downtown, about a hundred bucks in cash.
Credit cards, AAA.
I'm going to roll him.
Abrasion on his neck.
That dude's awfully pale.
Abnormally pale.
Especially since he's only been dead for Check the neck.
Check the wrist.
What's this?
Looks like our killer might have left us a little present.
What a shame!
That is a very unusual necklace and it shows off your clavicle quite well.
For all eternity.
Gus, no blood.
Puncture wounds.
Abnormally pale.
What?
Do it.
Yeah.
Do it.
Or, better yet, let me do it.
I'll do it.
Settle down.
You're not going to do it.
I wish I had a bigger audience.
Do it.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I must ask you to brace yourselves, what I'm about to expunge is not for the faint of heart.
It's bold, with a zesty, salty finish.
What we're up against here is no mere mortal.
I'm afraid this very well may be the work of a vampire.
Sookie is mine!
What are you thinking, partner?
Actually, I'm going to have to go with Spencer on this one.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know You know you weren't nearly this pumped when you thought we were chasing a werewolf.
I'm not trying to get devoured by a hairy, famished beast, Shawn, but I will whip me some lithe, wispy vampire ass.
All right.
Dude, you reek of garlic.
You look like Omar Epps from Dracula 2000.
I'll take it.
You don't think it's odd that Lassie jumped on our vampire wagon?
You know, I've long since dreamt of Lassie jumping on board with one of my nutty theories but now that he's actually done it, I don't know why I thought it would be so cool.
It does feel odd.
It's like the Road Runner stopping and saying, "You know what, Wile E., "you've earned this.
Blow me up".
You're saying the coyote has a first name?
Yeah.
It's not 0-S-C-A-R?
That's bologna.
You're bologna.
Necro butcher!
Ryan Phillippe!
We're trying out pet names.
Yours is "bologna".
Can we get started please?
Of course.
For you, my lady.
Aw.
What is it?
A small intestine of a ram.
Hmm.
Cause of death.
Pulmonary failure or severe blood loss.
Whichever came first.
How severe?
Tank's just about on empty.
Um, bit of trivia, the human body when drained of most of its blood will oftentimes stop working.
Note the puncture wounds on the neck there, and on the wrists here and here.
Woody, in your professional opinion, is it possible that this poor man was the victim of a vampire attack?
Don't dignify that with a response.
I wasn't planning on it.
Is it possible?
Most likely, yes.
Woody!
It's a given, really.
All right, people, that's enough.
I think it's obvious we are after a vampire who's out there doing stuff that vampires do, so, get on this and find me a lead.
Carlton, have you lost your Where are you going?
I have a personal matter to attend to.
I will catch up.
Since when do you have personal matters?
Okay, my partner has gone off the reservation.
I hope that you are all very happy.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to catch a murderer and I'm fairly certain that he or she is human.
Well, there goes my night.
Does this necklace look familiar to you?
Hey, we used to sell this piece.
Hey, no kidding!
I'm going to need a record of everyone who's purchased this thing in the last Oh, I don't know, let's just say, ever.
Oh, man, it's not possible.
Come again.
Well, it's It's just this piece, we only had a few of them, it was years ago.
How many years ago?
Three or four, maybe.
We don't really keep records of that kind of stuff.
I mean, look around, we're not Zales or Jarreds.
Okay, I don't suppose that you would remember who made these purchases, would you?
Dudes.
Chicks.
No.
No, not really, no.
Just forget it.
I should have known a place called "Bling Crosby" would be a dead end.
I mean, look at you.
Sorry, man.
That's a killer watch you have though.
You want to sell it for way less than it's worth?
This old thing?
Just keeps on ticking like the heart of a wounded elephant, just grizzled and Why don't you hold that thought while I go freshen up?
I'll be damned.
This is not funny, Shawn.
I am the only sane person working this case and that makes my time even more valuable.
Do you have any idea how long it took me to find this ridiculous place?
It doesn't have an address.
Hello?
Shawn!
I can't help being a gorgeous fiend.
It's just the card I drew.
What in the hell are you wearing?
We're on their turf, Juliet.
You have to walk the walk of a true night stalker.
Night stalker?
He's right.
Look around.
You're the fish out of water here.
Because they're all pretending to be dead, Shawn.
Or perhaps, it is us who pretend to be alive.
Greetings, brother.
Three virgin Sloe Gin Fizzes.
Make them Bloody Marys, and whatever snack mix you can whip up over there.
I will gladly serve the two of you.
However, the human is not going to get a drink from me.
You've broken the cardinal law by allowing a day walker to enter our realm.
Okay, that's it.
Detective O'Hara, SBPD.
Let's try this again.
Whoa, hey, okay, slow it down there, Cagney.
Just a regular guy here, okay?
Trying to make a dollar.
That's it.
Play up this whole character thing to get some extra money out of these freaks.
Charlatan!
Who's talking?
Count Chocula over here, please.
Count Chocula?
You must be out of your damn mind.
What did I tell you?
No one remembers Blacula except for us and Quentin Tarantino.
Look, we're just wondering if If you think any of your customers here are dangerous or capable of attacking someone and sucking all their blood out?
You're kidding, right?
Dude, this is Santa Barbara, okay?
All the people here are like fashionistas and slam poets.
I'm leaving now.
Oh, wait, I do have one little piece of info you might find interesting.
I got a call last week, I believe, on Wednesday.
And it was a customer who was asking if I would sell them a pint of real blood.
Weird.
Did you recognize the voice?
No.
Can't say I did.
You remember when they called?
Uh, yes.
As a matter of fact, it was at 1:30.
It was exactly 1:30 on Wednesday because I was watching Oprah and it was right in the middle of What's that guy, Nate?
Berkus!
Berkus!
Love that guy!
He was refurbishing a Chippendale.
Amazing stuff.
Caller I.D. Would you like to do the honors?
We're going to need to see that phone.
Oh.
Marlowe Viccellio.
How'd you find me?
Is something wrong?
You don't live alone.
No.
It's me and three guys.
Have you ever dated, thought about dating or have any casual relations with these freeloading parasites?
No.
Is this an interrogation?
Believe me, I wish it weren't.
Where's the necklace?
I don't understand.
"For all eternity".
The necklace.
Oh, well, I I didn't sleep in it.
Show it to me.
Okay.
Follow me.
I can't believe you're already in my bedroom.
You want to tell me what this is about, Detective?
Okay, one more thing and I promise we'll be able to laugh about this.
I need to know exactly what happened after you left last night.
I went out the bathroom window and I ran across the street and I sat in my car and I Watched you wait for me.
Huh?
You got into a fight with the bartender and then you finished your drink and then you went to the back and eventually you went outside and exchanged heated words with a homeless man.
And you looked really sad.
I just let you walk away.
Why would you do that?
I just It's been tough for me lately.
I just haven't had much luck.
I felt something.
So did I. The only thing it compares to is the rush of jubilation I felt when I heard Chuck Norris speak at an NRA convention in Aberdeen.
I was 13.
I just got scared.
I'm sorry.
Marlowe Viccellio!
This is the police!
Hold on, guys.
Don't touch anything yet.
Carlton, what's going on here?
Carlton, what exactly is going on here?
I suppose I do owe you an explanation, partner.
I owe you two nothing and you look like a couple of ass hats in those ridiculous costumes.
I'm dangerous, in a sexy way.
More like a gay way.
Well, I'm straight up iconic.
I wouldn't call Count Chocula an icon.
I'm Blacula.
And you're going to be under arrest, you suckubus.
Now, hold on.
All right, there's no way she could have committed this murder.
She has an airtight alibi.
Murder?
Carlton, somebody called a vampire bar asking to buy a lot of blood.
We traced the call and it came from inside this house.
Can you explain that?
Sure, I have three roommates and they're a quirky group of guys, so I wouldn't put it past any of them to do something like that.
You live with two dudes and Mario Lopez?
But she doesn't have carnal knowledge of any of them.
What's this airtight alibi?
Go ahead.
You tell them the truth.
I was with Carlton at a bar and snuck away to my car to watch him because I was nervous about the level of attraction I immediately felt for him.
Both emotionally and physically.
No, seriously, what's the alibi?
She recounted my every move as I sat stoic at the bar.
There's no way she could have been in two places at one time.
You realize by corroborating her story Yes, O'Hara.
It means I'm her alibi.
And needless to say, I don't believe in vampires.
You will when she bites you.
Because she doesn't love you enough not to condemn you.
You watch that hairy eyeball, Spencer, this lady's been through enough.
Marlowe, we're going to need to talk to each of your roommates and find out who made that call.
Ah, yeah.
I understand.
It's Eddie, Jake and Lucien.
Where's Lucien?
So any food allergies I should know about before I dazzle you with dinner?
Nuts.
What kind of nuts?
All nuts?
Filberts.
Check.
Lucien, our suspect, is in the interrogation room.
What?
Oh, oh, there will be dessert.
Dude, no dice.
It needs to be garlic to skin contact, Shawn.
Huh?
Are you sure this water's holy?
Yes.
I had Father Wesley bless it over the phone.
Over the phone?
Yes.
I don't think it works like that.
You don't know how anything works, Shawn.
So, Lucien, where were you between the hours of 10:00 p.m. And the year 1540?
What?
Ah!
Take it, creature.
Ow!
Guys, enough!
Man, I don't think this is silver.
I paid for silver.
Well, you got hosed.
Wow.
You guys are actually devolving.
Get back over here.
Now!
Really?
Answer the question, Lucien.
I was working my shift at King Putt minigolf.
There was a late rush and I closed the course that night.
Hold up.
Ah!
Will King Putt honor an expired two-for-one groupon?
Yes or no?
Shawn, this is serious.
Listen, on the third hole, I usually putt the right side, bank through the rubber bumpers but I still keep getting nailed by the swinging mammaries.
Those aren't mammaries.
They're the bells on the end of a jester's cap.
Really?
Yes.
It's putt putt, for kids.
Oh.
Lucien, we will need to verify your alibi with the management at King Putt.
Fine.
His name is Wayne.
Ooh.
I'm not buying this.
I can see your bedroom, man, with the cracked mirror and the kitty litter.
Give it up, shape shifter.
I don't have a bedroom.
I live in the tent out back.
You should be talking to Ed.
We got the wrong roommate.
I know where we need to be.
We don't have much time.
Why are we at a blood bank?
Well, it's fairly common for full-fledged vampires to wander the barrens, you know, graveyards, industrial wastelands, places of irreversible urban blight.
The blood bank does seem a likely place for the undead to quench their hunger.
Five minutes and we are leaving.
There is 0% chance I'm getting caught up in this fantastical vampire nonsense.
So you're saying there's a chance.
No, Shawn, I said 0%.
Edward has entered the building.
What?
Where?
It was a classic shifting technique.
It was incognito man-to-animal maneuver.
That's correct.
Looks like we may be dealing with an elder, or even worse, a diablerie.
No.
Yes.
- We're leaving.
- What?
No.
Why did we come all the way out here?
Edward's in the building.
To investigate, he's wandering around.
My God, I used to be a detective.
Now I'm a babysitter.
That makes you Elisabeth Shue and Gus is Keith Coogan.
You're Coogan.
You're Coogan.
Your mama's Coogan.
What?
I Hello, Edward.
Just act natural.
Never look a feline in its eye, unless you want to be its Just stop it.
Here we go.
He's looking right at you, Gus.
He's looking at Juliet.
No, he isn't.
Did I just see what my brain is telling my eyes that I saw?
Was that a cape?
Okay, how did it get from one end of the building to the other in two seconds?
Ooh, blood products!
Shh.
Detective, what have you got?
We had good reason to believe our suspect was here in the blood bank.
Uh, we entered and what we saw was a hooded figure who appeared to move with inexplicable speed.
Ah!
As if it were Mr. Spencer, if I may, what we're looking at is someone who's capable of "vamp" speed or presentspace quantum leap.
Blacula gives a shout out to Bakula.
The truth is, I don't know what we saw.
Here's the good news, said suspect is in custody and in due time we'll be able to stick the nails to him.
Let me say that Shawn and Gus's opinion does not reflect my own.
What suspect?
That's a feline.
That will drink you like a juice box.
Don't be deceived.
That is a grown ass man who feeds off the blood Gus, you must stop.
Look, I'm going to tell the Chief that Detective O'Hara's in full, undeterred control of this investigation.
I'll spare the, uh, juicy details.
I'm getting something.
Shoot the glass.
It's Hans Gruber.
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
Where's Lassie?
I'm pretty sure he invited his new girlfriend over for dinner.
If he invites a vampire into his home, it's free to feed on him at will.
We are the only ones in the world that can save him right now.
Let's go.
Hi, Carlton.
Mmm.
Something smells delicious.
Well, I'd like to say it's the elk loin I've been braising but, I have a feeling that intoxicating scent is you, Marlowe.
Oh.
Would you like to come in?
I'd love to.
Hi.
Hi.
Come on, Lassie, let the right ones in, buddy!
Unless you're already undead!
In which case would you kindly impale yourself with a wooden stake?
Spencer, Guster, go away!
Carlton, open the door.
O'Hara?
Give us some sort of signal that you're okay?
A cough or a thump of some kind.
Henry?
Should I call for the battering ram?
McNab!
What the hell is wrong with you people?
Can't you see I'm in the throes of passion?
Contrary to public opinion, I do not get this kind of action every night.
Are you wearing garters?
No, you dullard.
These are standard, military issue.
They keep my shirt tucked tight throughout the day.
We found this press-on nail at the Santa Barbara blood bank which was robbed earlier this evening.
Marlowe, mind showing us your mitts please?
Go ahead.
This is just a crazy coincidence.
These nails were made popular by Jersey Shore.
Nice try, Queen of the Damned.
JWOWW does wear those nails when they go out clubbing.
What?
I'm not saying I buy her story.
Like Marlowe said, they're very common.
We certainly need more evidence than this.
Okay, well, then I'm sure she won't have a problem with us searching her house.
Of course she won't.
She's got nothing to hide, right?
Uh-huh.
That's right.
So let's go over there and clear her good name.
Anything?
Not yet.
Don't rush me, Shawn, I'm being thorough.
Uh-oh!
I'm sensing something cold and very unfortunate.
Something icy, like Marlowe's aorta.
Spencer, this is personal for me.
Either conduct yourself like an adult or I will remove you from these premises with force.
You're right.
That was insensitive.
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's hug it out.
I would rather learn to play the harp.
Okay.
This is nice.
Hello, plasma!
Okay, so I did take the blood but only because I'm trying to make ends meet and they pay really good money on the black market for that, but I promise I didn't kill anybody.
I can't bear what you must think of me right now, but you have to believe me.
I can't.
You're under arrest.
What?
O'Hara, this case is officially yours.
I'll be in my apartment if you need me.
I trust you will not.
What are we supposed to do?
Haul all this blood back to the bank?
No.
I think we should just leave it here.
Would you relax, buddy?
Look, this stuff is locked and loaded in these thick rubber baggies.
Is he responsive at all?
No.
Nothing.
We even held a plate of bean and cheese nachos in front of his face.
How much blood was it exactly, Shawn?
Just a little stream.
It's not like it was the end of Carrie.
Or the beginning of Carrie.
Look, Jules, did you get Marlowe to confess to the murder or what?
No, but it's only a matter of time before she cracks.
I just feel so bad for Lassiter.
He seemed to really care about this girl.
Oh, Shawn, hang on a sec.
Sorry to interrupt, but a man was just attacked in the parking lot of Lox, Stock and Two Toasted Bagels over on Fletcher Street, and the perpetrator attempted to drain him of his blood.
He's at Saint Thomas and the Apostles.
Shawn, did you hear that?
Yes!
Greatest name for a bagel joint ever.
Plus, this means Lassie's in love with a liar and a blood thief, but not a full on murderer.
Well, slap Gus as hard as you can and meet me at the hospital.
Copy that.
All right, Dad, I got this.
Okay.
All right, listen up, buddy.
This hurts me way more than it hurts you.
Oh!
Welcome back, Guster.
Psst!
Don't you dare!
He's clearly not going to eat it, Shawn, and I'm hungry like a mug.
You're You're hungry like a what?
Okay, Ron, can you tell us what happened tonight?
Yeah.
Okay.
What happened?
A guy in a cape attacked me.
Did you get a good look at his face?
No.
Are you sure?
Nah.
All right.
Well thanks, Ron, you've been a huge help so far.
This is the Chief.
I'm going to take it outside.
You're unbelievable!
I haven't eaten since breakfast, Shawn.
It's another man's sandwich.
So?
Well, someone's lucky to be alive.
Who?
Well, you are, son.
O negative.
Do what?
How did know his blood type?
Uh, it's just a special gift that I bust out on rare occasions and almost all the time.
Well, yes, Ron here has one of the rarest blood types there is.
How rare?
Extremely.
In fact, I've been looking for a blood donor but, there are only about two dozen people in Santa Barbara who have O negative blood.
The killer's after O negative.
I need a diversion.
Slip a disc or start peeing yourself.
Ahhh!
Doctor, my friend has peed himself.
No, I slipped a disc!
Ahhh!
Well, just breathe, young man.
It's probably just a spasm.
It hurts.
Gus, have some respect for yourself.
You all right?
Yes, Doctor, I breathed into the spasm and it loosened up nicely.
Thanks, Doc.
Thank you.
Dude, one of the names on the list is Adrian Viccellio.
I bet you that's Marlowe's brother.
He has something called Van Wilder's disease.
Von Willebrand's?
That's a rare blood disorder that requires patients to have transfusions on a regular basis.
It usually affects humans and Doberman Pinschers.
That's oddly specific.
There are three types of VWD.
Type two is divided into four subtypes.
Shawn, I bet you anything that our guy had the worst type and lost his insurance.
Dude, that's it.
He's having to steal the blood from the few people that have his rare type.
He probably swiped the list of matching donors during his last hospital stay.
Well, that's just conjecture.
It's all conjecture, Shawn, that's all we're doing right now.
All right, Ron, we're going to need to swab your clothing and both your fists.
No, Jules, Jules.
It's Marlowe's brother, Adrian.
He has something called Don Skarsgard's disease.
He needs a lot of rare blood, O negative, and he's having to steal it because he doesn't have insurance.
Did you just say O negative?
Yeah.
That's Carlton's blood type.
We got to go.
Carlton, please don't hang up.
I begged the police for this call.
I I had to call you to tell you that you could be in some serious There's a cage, Marlowe, a cage made of brawn and steel that protects my heart, I welcomed you inside that cage.
I offered you a season pass for the festival of light that happens inside my chest cavity.
Festival?
Like Hanukkah?
You didn't want it.
What's worse is you never wanted it.
I do want it, but I need to warn you that you I'm going to tell you the same thing I told my mother and her new girlfriend the day I left for the Academy, "Why don't you both just get in your car "and Thelma & Louise yourselves right into the Pacific".
It's an ugly thing to say.
I wish I could take it back but I was confused.
I didn't want my mother to be a lesbian at 53.
Eventually I came to realize that Althea makes her happy in a way that Dad never could.
Carlton, I need you to focus and listen to me!
Spencer, go away!
Carlton, don't answer the door!
Hold on a sec.
Carlton, please What?
What?
What?
I'm serious about this.
Is Tamara home?
Who the hell is Tamara?
Carlton, please!
Carlton!
You're that hooligan from that awful haberdashery.
It's easier if you don't talk, Detective.
If you just close your eyes, all of this nasty business will be over before you know it.
I promise.
Marlowe and her brother both robbed the blood bank.
We were actually seeing two people.
So, you see?
There is a rational explanation for everything, Shawn.
There is no rational explanation for anything until we see the other roommate and that black cat together in the same place at the same time.
I took the liberty of hanging up on my big sis.
She was pretty upset.
Marlowe's your sister?
You didn't know?
I figured she would have told you, seeing as how she's all sweet on you.
She is?
All right, listen, so you're not going to get away with this.
And your sister Look, you are one tough son of a bitch.
And I'm happy for Marlowe.
She's been sacrificing everything and taking care of me forever and she deserves A nice guy who will take care of her.
You know I can't really do that if I'm dead now, can I?
Just make one smart move I am not going to kill you.
Nobody was ever supposed to die.
That first guy was alive when I left him.
I swear it.
I wouldn't even be here, see, except I can only assault innocent blood donors when I have my strength and right now I am freshly transfused.
Or was.
That guy on the list ahead of you kicked my ass earlier tonight.
You can say that again.
In a couple days, I'm going to be clinging onto life again.
So, here we are.
Desperate times call for Blah, blah, blah.
The dude is a real life vampire, babe.
I am not conceding the fact that vampires don't exist.
And you know you guys could at least pretend to be a little bit concerned about Carlton.
Hey, whatever the situation may be, I'm sure Lassie is firmly in control.
Danger is his middle name.
I, for one, am less optimistic.
You know if you're sick, we can get you some help.
This is insane.
No, see, the insurance darlings no longer feel any responsibility to help out.
I am a liability.
You see Think about Marlowe.
She's an accomplice.
She'll do hard time.
She never laid a finger on anyone.
You were her first mark and we both know how that went.
So, she stole some blood.
Big deal.
She did it to save a life and that's what it's there for, isn't it?
Well, isn't it?
No more talking.
Carlton, are you okay in there?
Gus, quick, give me your credit card!
Great, Jules, kick the door in.
What?
Carlton, open the door!
Are you okay?
Never better.
We need to get this young man to the hospital and the station.
It's possibly in that order.
I'm not entirely sure.
Whoa.
What happened here?
Chloroform.
Sneak attack.
Unbeknownst to my assailant, I've slowly and methodically been building up a tolerance to chloroform over the last 15 years.
Dear God, why?
For a night like this, Spencer.
I don't believe it.
It must have been some other kind of chemical.
Oh, great!
Now we have to carry two guys out of here.
Bitch!
I mean, look at him.
He really wore his heart on his sleeve through all of this.
I mean, he's obviously hurting.
I just think it would be nice if he knew that we were all here for him.
What would you have us do?
Seriously.
Well, go talk to him.
Give him some encouragement.
Let him know that there are plenty of fish in the sea.
Rock, paper, scissors?
Fine.
What is that?
Spider.
Crap on a cracker!
There is no spider.
There was no spider.
Now he's here.
And he's hairy and he's venomous and he's unbeatable.
The other three are all inanimate objects, Shawn.
A spider can't bite a pair of scissors.
Yeah, he's right.
Scissors clearly have the advantage.
And, well, rock crushes spider, oh, but I suppose spider crawls on paper.
Mmm.
Go on.
Hey, Lassie.
Uh, I just wanted to say, you know, that the sea is vast and filled with many strange creatures and corals.
Mostly divorced corals.
Probably with a bunch of kids.
And they're just looking for any old crustacean with a steady income so Sorry, Spencer.
No time for your empty boneheaded musings.
I'm late for an appointment.
I wasn't sure you'd come.
I'm a man of my word.
I'm so sorry.
I wish I Look, you did what you thought you had to do.
If there's an upside to any of this, it's that your brother will finally get the care he needs now that he's going to be in the system for a long, long, long time.
Can I ask you something?
Anything.
Where would you rate Pink Cadillac in the Eastwood canon?
Not very high, I'm afraid.
I mean, I suppose it's a good companion piece to City Heat, but he's much funnier with the orangutan.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
That's Gus.
He and I are going to the comic book convention.
Just be finished saving the world before the streetlights come on.
Where's your costume?
I'm wearing it.
I'm Tap-Man.
The tap dancing superhero.
How is it that you always make the wrong choice between cool and stupid?
Hey, hey, Shawn.
Give Guster a chance to present his case for Tap-Man.
Tap-Man meets all the superhero requirements.
Superpower, rhythm, alter ego, mild-mannered dance instructor.
His arch-nemesis, Riverdance Man.
Wow, that is stupid.
Yeah, and plus, how does he fight?
Well, he confuses the bad guys with his quick syncopation, and grabs some tap sand from his trusty pouch and splat!
Right in the eyes.
Come on, let's go, we're already late.
To the Tap Mobile!
Are you sure no one can tell my true identity under this?
For your sake, let's hope so.
Stop!
Freeze!
SBPD.
This is all your fault, Shawn.
You're the one that blew our cover.
No one told you to open the car door and set off the alarm!
Why was the alarm on?
We were still inside the car!
Inside the car, not getting car-jacked and brutalized.
Thank you very much.
Just hurry up.
If we catch these guys, we're heroes.
No, if we catch these guys, we'll be dead.
You think we lost 'em?
I think we're clear.
You tripped me!
Come on, son.
You tripped me!
You come on, son!
Come on, son!
Come on, son!
Come on, son!
This is the last time I let you use your fast-twitch muscles as an excuse for anything!
You and I both know that's not true.
Damn it!
I'm gonna go catch those guys.
Looks like somebody got to these guys before we did.
The Mantis.
A little thicker on the eyebrows.
Are you sure?
Let's see.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
And you should add another wheel.
It'll imply more motion.
Dude, in your dreams.
You're right.
I can't skateboard that well.
What the hell's this?
He's too cheap to pay the caricature artist at the pier $30, so he decided to get one this way.
That'll be all.
You are done wasting our time.
I'll say when I'm done.
All right, I'm done wasting everyone's time.
Besides, I'm missing a Phineas and Ferb marathon.
Perry the Platypus.
He's a real platypus.
Let me know what you find out.
Come on, son.
He's an idiot.
All right, which one of you lowlifes wanna describe the guy that did this to you?
He was well built, about six feet tall, 200 pounds.
He came out of nowhere.
And before we realized what happened, he was gone.
Did he have on a bodysuit and have intense eyes shining through a dark mask?
You saw him too, Guster?
No, but I see him now.
See?
It's easy to read no matter how you spin it.
I'm telling you, I'll never buy a real paper again.
I can't believe you told them I tripped.
What?
You tripped.
No, I did not.
You tripped.
No, I did not, Shawn.
Chief Vick, is it true that the four criminals the vigilante caught are members of the Camino Drug Syndicate?
Reginald, you've been around here long enough to know I'm not answering that.
All right, that's it.
Last thing we need is a bunch of reporters twisting our words.
Especially you copy monkeys at The Mirror.
Don't think I've forgotten about the whole Detective Dipstick incident.
Look, that piece was written by Chad Gorsuch.
And he's now on assignment in South America.
Well, at least he's being punished.
Chief, can you give us any information?
What can you tell us?
Have the Caminos really taken control of all cocaine production from rival gangs?
No comment.
Chief, who is the masked man?
No comment.
Should other citizens follow his lead?
Okay, that I'll comment on.
Vigilantism is a dangerous act.
The art of apprehending criminals should be left to the police officers who have been adequately trained and equipped.
Well, then why does Detective Lassiter's report say that the police consultant failed to apprehend the four suspects because he was, quote, "Woefully out of shape"?
I have a comment.
I was tripped by my clumsy assistant, Watson Williams.
I am not your assistant.
And my name is not Watson Williams.
Oh!
But you do admit to tripping me.
What Okay, no more questions.
You heard the chief!
Everybody outside, come on.
Scat!
We're trying to get something.
All right, people, listen up.
I would be lying if I said this vigilante hasn't made us look bad in recent days.
I'd also be lying if I said I didn't sometimes wish that I could operate outside the constraints of the badge, and dish out some good old-fashioned street justice of my own.
But we can't.
Yeah.
Apparently not even while traveling along the border.
Not even.
Right.
So we rely on good old-fashioned police work.
Detective O'Hara.
The first two pictures are locations where the vigilante, or The Mantis, as he's affectionately known to the public, apprehended members of the Camino Drug Syndicate.
Affectionately known?
We have also listed the dates.
In each situation, a major drug exchange was in progress.
This is a well-funded and extremely well organized operation.
We have located a handful of the phony businesses that they are using as fronts, but there could be a dozen more.
Now, we were just notified of this most recent bust on the Ventura Police Force.
This bust, combined with the others that The Mantis has impressively handled, gives us eight of the Camino Syndicate members.
Let's get out there and get the rest.
You heard her, go do it!
It sounds like you want to give this weirdo some kind of medal.
Shawn, oftentimes vigilantes are just good people who wanna take back their neighborhood from a bad element.
Sure.
Charles Bronson real charmer.
Eastwood in Gran Torino, there's a guy you wanna hop in the tub with.
Okay.
The Mantis is a bit eccentric, and I wouldn't go as far as to say that I support what he's doing, but you have to admit, he's done a better job than we have at slowing down the Caminos.
And he's just one guy.
I'm just one guy.
I've solved more crimes than I can count.
Because I've solved a lot of crimes, not just because I can't count very high.
Yes, but you have a supernatural psychic gift.
The Mantis is solving crimes using his natural instincts and sharply honed abilities.
She's right, Shawn.
I mean, if you were a regular guy solving these crimes, that'd really be impressive.
But everyone knows that you're a psychic.
I mean, it's really an unfair advantage.
I guess you're right, Gus.
Thanks a lot, Benedict Arnold Jackson.
I know what this is about.
You're jealous of all the attention that The Mantis is getting, especially from Juliet.
Please, you think I care if Juliet gives another guy a little attention.
How insecure do you think I am?
Seriously, how insecure do you think I am?
I need you to tell me.
Will you please tell me?
Why are you bothered by this guy?
Because, Gus, there's already a badass crime fighter in a cool outfit running around this town.
And his name is me.
The Mantis can't even fly.
Or activate into half of something he just happened to need in the moment.
He's clearly emulating the everyman superheroes like Batman and Ironman.
Besides, you shouldn't criticize the guy without knowing his origin story.
The Mantis is not a real superhero, Gus.
He's just some nut in a mask.
Hey, what's that calendar you have on your desk?
The one that's all looney?
You mean lunar.
It tracks the phases of the moon.
When's the next phase?
New moon.
It's coming soon, the 26th.
Twenty-sixth.
Everyone stop what you're doing and only pay attention to me!
I'm getting a clear psychic vision of when the next Camino drug exchange will take place.
September 26th.
It's October.
That means it's almost like, a year away.
October of this year, Shawn.
October 26th because this is the month of October.
Spencer, you're not even officially on this case.
You know the routine.
First you go Dad, can I please You're hired.
Well, there it is.
Fine.
We'll look into it.
Have Vice monitor any local street chatter for anything going down on the 26th.
Especially any large industrial shipments occurring after hours.
Nobody breathe a word of this to anybody outside the force.
How's that for one man?
No, seriously, how was that for one man?
I need you to tell me.
It was all right.
It's on, Mantis.
I'm not The Mantis, Shawn.
You're damn right you're not.
You could never be The Mantis.
You have problems.
Attention all units, we have a positive on suspected Camino activity at the pier four shipping docks.
All units respond.
Really?
Again?
The Mantis took out four perps single-handedly.
Again, without a gun or needless bloodshed.
That is classic superhero moral code.
Well, whoever he is, I'm glad he's on our side.
She used to talk about you that way.
Would you stop it?
Whoever The Mantis is, he's not doing this by himself, Gus.
He clearly has an inside angle.
Which means he either overheard my psychic revelation or he got a hold of the information that the cops have.
How is that possible?
Nobody breathe a word of this to anybody outside the force.
It isn't.
Unless he's already on the inside of the police department.
Whoever this brother is he's gonna be hard to spot.
You can't just assume he's a brother because he's all mysterious and smooth.
You'll see.
He's either a brother or Persian.
I can't talk to you when you're like this.
Okay.
All right, I know it's not Lassie, because he's way too proud to solve crimes anonymously.
And it's not 1976.
No.
Who's the new guy?
I don't know.
But he is the right height and weight.
And he was here when I revealed my inside tip.
Hey, there.
We never met officially.
This is Gus, I'm Shawn.
Scott Reynolds.
Just transferred over from Ventura PD.
We were just notified of this most recent bust 20 minutes ago, by our colleagues on the Ventura Police Force.
That's quite a grip you have there, Scott.
You must work out?
A little.
No, come on now.
Feels like more than just a little.
Doesn't it, Gus?
Shawn.
Feel it.
I don't wanna feel it.
Feel the man's fitness level.
I'm not feeling Do it.
Fine.
Wow, you are kinda fit.
Uh-huh.
You look like you could handle yourself in a dark alley full of guys.
I suppose if I had to.
I bet you're real nice with the hand-to-hand action.
Oh, my God.
Dude, what are you doing?
Get to the bottom of it.
Watch and learn, Gus.
This is just like a dance.
I know how to dance, Shawn.
Guys, excuse me, I got some work to do.
Yeah, no problem.
We'll catch you later, Dr. Muscles.
It's definitely him.
So what do we do next?
I should probably go throw some lunchmeat at the guys in the drug tank.
After we prove that he's The Mantis.
No, we do that first.
Which they all ate using the same fork.
Shawn, you're not even listening.
I am, I am.
Why, why'd you say that?
I just gave you a set-up containing "Mr. T", "Crockett" and a word that rhymes with "Mork" and I got nothing.
Not even a Battle of the Network Stars joke.
Come on.
What's going on?
All right.
All right, listen.
I I need to say this.
With regards to The Mantis Oh!
Okay.
You know what?
Let's just Let's just finish our dinner and not talk about work or The Mantis.
Why, why, why not?
Well, I just think that we clearly have different opinions about him.
Clearly.
And I don't want it to be an issue between us if we don't see eye-to-eye on a case, or a suspect, or whatever.
Why would that possibly be an issue?
I mean, Gus and I never see eye-to-eye on work stuff.
For instance, he doesn't like being used as a human shield when we're being shot at.
I happen to think it's a very noble way to meet one's maker, especially for a guy like him.
Bottom line is, we never let that difference of opinion interfere with anything.
Okay.
Well, as long as you know that it's not a competition.
I know that.
Look, let's just Let's just have a nice dinner, see who can eat the fastest and not talk about work.
Great.
What's up?
Oh!
No, it's nothing.
It's just a work thing.
Do you need to go?
No!
No, no, no.
They send the message out to everybody.
And they know that I am off duty.
You wanna go, don't you?
Well It's okay, Jules.
You can go.
You should go.
Go.
You can go.
Really?
Yes.
Okay.
I'll call you later.
Yep.
Okay.
Hey, excuse me.
Could I get a check as soon as humanly possible?
Thanks.
Confirmed.
Multiple units en route to reported activity at 1250 Marine Way.
Potentially armed suspects.
Proceed with caution.
He's been here again.
Left, left.
Left.
It's The Mantis!
Don't try anything.
Make way!
Make way!
Have the police ID'd the last culprit?
Can you confirm or deny reports that The Mantis has been identified?
Was The Mantis injured?
Sir?
Will For the cover, please!
For the cover of The Record please, sir!
You caused quite a stir.
It's a madhouse out there.
Thanks, Buzz.
But I think I'm safe now.
Do you expect anyone to believe that you were actually The Mantis this entire time?
Please.
Of course I'm not The Mantis.
What have we been doing?
We've been trying to expose him.
Well, how do you explain being dressed as him?
Because from the looks of it, you're a copycat vigilante.
Maybe you secretly look up to this guy.
Look, I realized that the Camino Syndicate was gathering in one of the Baine Industry buildings.
I thought I could finally expose his identity by getting to the bad guys first and catching him in the act.
And just as I thought, he had the same inside information I did and was already there.
You hear that?
Looks like your game is up.
We're about to find out who you really are.
First, I used a classic, combat distraction mode.
You went boneless, didn't you?
I used my entire body as a weapon.
After an epic, very evenly-matched fight He sucker-punched me.
And I woke up with the fire alarm blaring and wearing that ridiculous painted-on costume which means, he saw me in my underwear.
You mean like, on Different Strokes?
Yes, Gus.
Just like Different Strokes.
That's not cool.
No, it's not, Gus.
He must've put on my clothes and blended in with the crowd leaving the first floor.
Damn it!
I had a handful of gummy worms in that jacket that he probably won't even eat.
Get your story straight.
Everybody is waiting to hear what happened.
You had everybody fooled there for a second.
Even though, if you were The Mantis, I was gonna have to bring back Tap-Man.
That's still the stupidest idea for a superhero ever.
How does he even fight?
Sand, Shawn.
Right in the eyes.
You ever had sand thrown in your eyes, Shawn?
It's debilitating.
No wonder you were acting so weird at dinner the other night.
I mean, I knew you were capable of amazing things, but this is just wow.
Well, cat's out of the bag now.
You guys get in here.
The real Mantis was just spotted 20 minutes ago.
Oh, was he?
I know you know I'm not telling the truth.
I know, you know.
All right, listen, we're in a lot of hot water with the Mayor's office for all the free press we're giving this guy every time he slips through our grasp.
So maybe you'd like to fill us in on what the hell happened down there.
The real Mantis dropped him like a sack of flour, took pictures of him in his underwear, then dressed in his clothes and escaped through the crowd downstairs.
You didn't even get a good look at him?
Great.
So, we still don't know who this guy is.
But we can add one more big bust to his record.
The perp we found knocked out next to you was a lieutenant in the Camino Syndicate.
We put the screws to him, and he let it slip that they're moving a huge shipment next weekend.
Which means this is our last chance to stop them before they flood the streets with product.
The Mantis knows that now, too.
What makes you say that?
Because he's someone in this department.
Can you prove it?
Give me one minute.
- Can we get a comment?
- Shawn?
There he is!
They didn't have my best stuff in there.
Mr. Spencer!
Do you have a statement?
I gotta ask a Q. Hey, hey, hey!
Officer Reynolds.
I know who you are.
Or should I say, what you are.
Excuse me?
Come on, man, you can't hide your identity from me.
It's time to let the secret out.
Listen, man.
I'm sorry I acted all weird earlier.
I'm just not used to getting hit on.
You're not What?
Look, I'm flattered, but I don't shoot that way.
I can't imagine how tough it must be for you around here.
But look, it gets better.
My God!
What would make you think that You must work out.
You could handle yourself in a dark alley full of guys.
I bet you're nice with the hand-to-hand action.
Okay, okay.
Okay, look.
Let's be very clear, here.
Okay?
I was not hitting on you.
It's okay, man.
Look, I got this buddy Pete that would be perfect for you.
Stop it.
I'm not We're talking about your secret identity, man.
Yours!
You know, by day, you're Officer Reynolds.
By night, you're Officer Mantis.
Or should I say Mantis Reynolds?
Why the long sleeves, huh?
You hiding something?
Like maybe the marks from your last fight?
Huh.
No bite marks.
No scratches.
And you have a tattoo of a Bullmastiff.
That's my nana.
Is she pretending to be a Bullmastiff?
I bet she's stopping traffic in Heaven.
She's not dead.
It's a good talk.
I got nothing.
Well, the crime scene photos from when we found you came in, maybe you can get something off of these.
There was no satchel of drugs.
Hey!
I know where it came from.
The Mantis had the satchel, not the Camino.
I'm sensing that this evidence was planted.
We're dealing with a fake bust!
The Mantis is padding his résumé, and possibly his costume.
I'm sorry, Spencer, forensics has already confirmed the drugs confiscated at the scene are the same strain sold on the streets by the Caminos.
Just a much lower grade.
Which corroborates the info from our perp.
They put out quality product first, then flood the area with a lower grade to maximize the profits.
In that case, I think we should consider the possibility that The Mantis is working with the Caminos.
First, you say he's on the force, then you say he's with the Caminos.
How hard did that guy hit you?
Hard.
Let me know when you can be useful.
Look, I am telling you, Jules, we are dealing with a bad, bad dude here.
Shawn, a messenger dropped this off for you.
Hey.
It's the clothes The Mantis stole from me.
"Sorry for the inconvenience.
"I had your clothes dry-cleaned as an offer of gratitude, "even though you pinched and bit me".
See?
You see what I mean?
Just pure evil.
You pinched and bit a man?
Okay.
Look, I know that I've been off, but seriously, when have I ever been wrong when I felt this strongly about something?
Shawn, what I was going to say is that maybe we should believe you.
I mean, if your suspicions about The Mantis are this strong then maybe we're missing something.
Hang on.
Thank you.
Hello?
- Is this Juliet O'Hara?
- It's The Mantis.
It's The Mantis.
I'll put it on speaker in the conference room.
Go to the conference room.
Go!
Come on!
Okay, I'm listening.
I'd like to compliment your department on helping me bring down the Caminos.
We make a good team.
His voice is really deep.
I've heard deeper.
Wow.
Really?
Thank you.
I wanted to let you know that in addition to the drugs found at the latest scene, if you run DNA analysis on your perp, you'll find hits to an unsolved murder from last year.
Okay, we'll look into it.
I also have reason to believe that a huge drug shipment to the Caminos is imminent.
Ha!
We already know that one.
Suck it!
Shawn, we're all professionals.
Oh, yeah?
You suck it.
You suck it!
What kind of man takes off another man's pants in a smoky boiler room?
I'm on to all your little tricks, man.
Have the police go down to the warehouse district in two hours.
I'll have another surprise waiting for you.
It's time to escalate the game.
Thank you.
You've been very helpful.
But it would be even more helpful if you told us who you were.
Crap.
Don't worry about it.
Let's get some units down to the warehouse district.
Let's beat him to this.
There!
Freeze, Mantis!
Step away from the body!
Put your hands where I can see 'em!
Well, he escalated the game all right.
Yeah.
To murder.
Wow, now I can read the paper and listen to my movie score playlist at the same time.
Would you move out of the way?
That's rough!
Quit playing around with that before you break it.
I guess I'm just a little giddy now that my nemesis has been exposed for the fraud that he was.
And, yes, I realize using the term giddy is a bit facetious.
Because the truth is, I am tickled pink.
The Mantis is not your nemesis, Shawn.
You don't have an alter-ego, a cool suit or a tragically ironic origin story.
You're just a hater.
Hater?
The only hater is The Mantis.
A hater of not murdering people.
I still don't get it.
Shooting a guy goes against The Mantis' established MO.
And I don't see a guy who was that consistent in his mythology suddenly abandoning it and using a gun.
Hmm.
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
Shawn, I know that look.
No, you don't.
You just deduced something that might prove The Mantis is innocent.
But you don't wanna say it because it might mean you were wrong about him.
I didn't deduce anything.
Shawn, you are a hysterical deducer and you know it.
So, spit it out.
Okay, fine, listen.
Generally, as a rule, when you shoot someone in the back, they fall forward, right?
Well, when we saw The Mantis, the victim was on his back.
Meaning The Mantis had flipped the body over.
Like you'd do if you were checking to see if somebody was already dead when you found him.
Or even if you were trying to save him.
Shawn, this man is innocent.
And we need to help him clear his name.
Well, guess what, Gus?
We can't.
Why not?
'Cause that is the downside of being all secret-identity-ee.
Look, we can't find him.
Unless we blast the Mantis Light into the sky.
Which would be pretty stupid, right?
Because the mantis looks like a little stick that walks around.
You're thinking of a walking stick.
No, those are the bugs that hop around in the grass.
That's a grasshopper.
"Could not remove stain on sleeve".
Well, I could've told them that.
Nothing gets out motor oil.
Especially not more motor oil, which I tried.
Gus.
You know how the police couldn't trace that package back to The Mantis?
Yeah, because he paid in cash and didn't leave a record.
But he didn't know the drycleaners put this in my jacket.
A paper trail.
Yeah.
That was a special rush order.
I'm sorry, I can't give you any more than that.
If you'll excuse me We're paying customers here.
Well, where are your items?
Dude, take off your shirt, give it to her for dry-cleaning.
You must be out of your damn mind.
Give her your shirt.
Then what am I supposed to wear tomorrow?
And the day after that?
And the day after that?
I don't know!
Oops, my bad.
Shawn!
This is a custom-made shirt!
Uh-oh.
What can we do about this stain before it sets in?
I have some industrial stain block in the back.
Just a minute.
All right!
Shawn, will you hurry up?
Bingo.
This is his regular drycleaners.
I got the address, let's get out of here.
All right.
All right, let's see.
What've we got here?
Oh, that's kinda weird.
What does that feel like?
Isn't that funny?
Oh!
There it is.
Look at that.
Good as new, buddy.
Good work from you.
We're in, Gus.
I don't know, Shawn.
Are you sure this is the right place?
the computer said.
I hear you, this place isn't very super hero-ish, is it?
Maybe we made a mistake.
What?
What?
You know that's right.
We need to get out of here.
We shouldn't be here in the first place.
Well, you should've thought of that before you picked the lock.
No, you picked the lock.
Human shield!
Whoa, whoa.
He's The Mantis?
Come on, Chief.
Can you give us any information?
What can you tell us?
That's how he got the information for the bust on the 26th!
Wait!
We're here to actually help you Clear your Because we know that you're We know that you were Cozened Nobody knows what "cozened" means.
"Cozened" is a fairly common word, Shawn!
Why can't you just be a normal person and say "Framed"?
We know you were framed?
You do?
Yeah.
I'm really, really sorry about this, guys.
I thought you were here to take me in to the police.
No, we think you're innocent.
Might be innocent.
I am not yet convinced.
It's amazing.
Nobody's gotten this close to actually figuring out who I really am.
Your psychic powers are amazing.
Gus, we have to help him.
He's a good man.
First, I have to know, why would a reporter wanna become a superhero?
All I do every day is write about recent pet grooming trends in Santa Barbara, where Rob Lowe had brunch, where Rob Lowe had dinner Lucky's.
And the politics and red tape that keep the police in this town from actually doing their job.
So I decided to do something.
And with my background in mixed martial arts, The Mantis was born.
And the first thing you decided to do was go after the biggest drug gang in town?
I knew that the Caminos operated in small groups with each drug transaction, which makes 'em quick and mobile, but it also keeps them pretty vulnerable if you have their schedule in advance.
Okay.
So, what really happened to the guy on the rooftop of the Baine building?
That was Carlos Jacott.
He was my inside man with the Caminos.
The head bosses found out he was trading secrets and so they killed him for snitching.
And then they set me up to look like I was the murderer.
Well, they were desperate.
You're very close to bringing 'em down.
Yeah, but not close enough.
I still can't figure out how the drugs are getting to the Syndicate.
Now, I've looked into all the clever ways criminals are smuggling drugs these days.
Inside children's toys, seafood shipments, plastics What about glass?
I suppose that could work, yeah.
You could embed the cocaine in the glass and then melt it, separate it at a later time.
That's it.
I can see the drugs infused in panes of glass.
Loaded into cargo containers.
A bunch of them, in a shipment yard called N- O N-O No Nosco!
Nosco.
That's a cargo company.
They ship from overseas.
So that's how they've been moving so much product without being detected!
Yeah, we've just gotta figure out where those cargo crates of glass are entering Santa Barbara before the drugs hit the streets.
But I'm sensing you're not gonna wanna help with that, are you?
What, are you nuts?
Now I've got the cops and the Caminos following me.
The Mantis is done.
Reginald, as difficult as this is for me to say, you were actually making a difference.
I mean, the Camino Syndicate was running scared, all because of you.
Your presence alone slowed them down.
Trust us.
All you have to do is show up to that shipment yard.
They'll take one look at you and run.
Hey, I don't know, guys.
I mean it's one thing to fight one on four, but if we actually do find a distribution center, it's gonna be more like one on 10.
What if you had help?
Detective unit back-up request.
Criminal investigation at warehouse district, 3900 Soltaire.
It's The Mantis!
The Catch!
And Tap-Man!
Give up while you still can!
We know how this'll end.
Shawn!
I thought you said we were gonna just scare them away!
They don't seem scared to me!
That's 'cause you just went up on your toes and started dancing!
What do we do now?
You two go distract 'em.
I'll take 'em out, one by one.
It's Detectives Lassiter and O'Hara requesting backup!
We're under heavy fire.
I told you this was a bad idea.
The only bad idea was you thinking that Tap-Man would fool anyone.
It's better than anything the Catcher man has.
The Catch.
Whatever.
He has no skills at all.
The Catch is an impenetrable wall, Gus.
And he will smack the mess out of you with this mitt.
Please.
You can't handle the mitt.
What The padded hand What are you talking about right now, Shawn?
Man, before everything went wrong, you were totally on board The Catch and Tap-Man.
Tap-Man and The Catch.
Get it right.
What was that?
Man, I told you that wouldn't work.
You have to believe!
Shut up!
You're welcome.
Guys!
What?
Come on!
Let's go!
Okay!
Go, go, go!
Inside!
Move!
Drop 'em!
Now, down on your knees!
On your knees!
- Do what he said!
- Don't move!
Drop your weapons!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it!
Get down on the ground, Mantis!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa!
Lassie, Jules, wait!
He's with us.
I don't care what you say, Spencer.
This man's wanted for murder.
No, no, no.
The Mantis was framed.
When we caught him above the body, he was actually trying to revive the victim.
And if you run ballistics on the Caminos' firearms, I bet you'll find your murder weapon.
Spencer, we can sort all this out down at the station.
Especially why you are wearing that ridiculous getup?
What the hell are you supposed to be, anyway?
The Turtle?
I am The Catch.
Although, I might have to borrow The Turtle if The Catch is already taken.
That's not bad, The Turtle.
Yeah.
We're done here.
I'm taking him in.
Guster!
Guster, did you just throw sand at me?
Ah, hell!
Where's The Mantis?
Oh, good.
You're all here.
Uh, the Mayor just called.
I would like to pass on his congratulations to all of you for bringing down the Camino Syndicate.
Just doing our job, Chief.
Besides, it was Shawn who psychically realized The Mantis had been framed and led him to Camino's headquarters.
He really deserves all the credit.
I wouldn't say that.
Well, not that it isn't true, I just wouldn't say it.
Oh, come on.
You might like it if you try it.
I would rather spend the rest of my life at Lilith Fair.
Fair enough.
Okay, but, gentlemen, this case is far from over.
We're still looking for where the Caminos hid all the money that they made from the drug trade.
Don't worry, Chief.
If it hasn't already been laundered, it's bound to show up somewhere.
Just like no one will know where or when Tap-Man and The Catch may show up.
The Catch and Tap-Man.
Shawn!
Oh, I think we know a lot of places and times they better not show up.
Are we clear on that?
Yes, ma'am.
Good day, gentlemen.
Okay.
Lunch later?
You bet.
I just need to drop something off to a friend first.
Okay.
Hey, Reginald.
I had your suit dry-cleaned.
Hey We're still looking for where the Caminos hid all the money that they made from their drug trade.
We've identified a handful of the phony businesses that they were using as fronts, but there could be a dozen more.
That was Carlos Jacott.
That was my inside man to the Caminos.
Son Hello, Reginald.
Looking tough there, sport.
Thanks.
You know what?
You give a bad name to all the good mantises everywhere.
This was never about honor or justice or even presidential fitness.
You just wanted to take down the Caminos so you could steal their dirty money.
I gotta say, I'm impressed.
You figured it out.
The truth is, I couldn't have done it without your help.
Man, the deal was we help you bring down the Caminos.
Not we help you get rich.
You risked my life.
You risked Gus' life, for what?
What, a million dollars in drug money?
Actually about $10 million.
No kidding.
Yeah.
The irony is, I was about to give up until you and your partner helped solve the final piece of the puzzle.
That's how they've been moving so much product without being detected!
And what happened at the glass factory, I couldn't have done that on my own.
So, here.
Thanks for coming out, champ.
Those are all Benjamins?
Oh, yeah.
Holy No, no.
No!
Absolutely not.
You know I can't let you get away with this, Reginald.
All right.
You want me to kick your ass for the third time?
Yeah.
Only now you're dealing with The Catch!
Strike one!
Strike two!
That's all you got?
Shawn!
Yeah!
Come on!
That's right in my eyes!
You were supposed to jump in at the beginning of the fight!
Freeze!
It's okay.
I said freeze!
The Catch cannot be stopped!
What?
Where you going?
Shawn!
Dag-nab it, Shawn!
Shawn!
Hold it!
Nobody steals on The Catch, Gus.
Nobody.
You know that's right.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh Here you go.
I don't know why you insist on depositing all of our checks yourself.
Because the last time I had you do it you asked for it all in singles.
Gus, I wanted to make it rain.
Half of our check blew out an open window, Shawn.
Well, maybe this will make it up to you.
What is this?
That is your shirt from earlier.
Now, it took a few cycles, but I managed to get the stain out completely.
Please tell me you didn't put my "Dry-clean Only" shirt in the washer.
You bet I did.
It shrunk, Shawn.
Yeah.
But so did the stain.
Look, you can't see it at all anymore!
This shirt cost me $100.
You owe me a new one.
What?
I would never spend $100 on a shirt.
You must be crazy.
Fine.
Then I'll just take yours.
Oh!
You did that on purpose!
No, that was an accident.
This was on purpose.
Give me those sleeves!
Make me!
You know, you and Shawn just got off on the wrong foot.
In time, you will see that he really is a great guy.
A great guy who calls your grandmother a dog.
She's not a dog.
Oh, I'm I'm sure she isn't.
And that was after Shawn and his partner poked and prodded me like I was a piece of meat.
Yeah, um, it may seem unorthodox at the time, but there's always a perfectly logical explanation for everything that Shawn does.
- No, you won't.
- Let me see those.
No, you won't.
Gimme those!
No, you won't.
You You You You just, just Gimme those sleeves.
Then again, some things are better left unexplained.
Gimme those sleeves!
Stop!
Stop!
Gimme I still think he'd be perfect for my buddy Pete.
Gimme those sleeves!
Stop.
No, I won't.
Gimme I want you to gimme those sleeves.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Ball four and that loads them for the reigning Double A player of the year, Cal Eason.
This is the exact guy manager Mel Hornsby wants up in this situation.
Way to go!
Way to go!
Good eye.
Thanks, Mel.
Some day I'm going to be just like you.
Well, not just like you, I won't chew tobacco.
That's murder on the gums.
And I'll get a different haircut, not that yours is that bad.
It just won't work with my head, you know?
And I definitely won't grab my crotch so much during games.
It's weird.
Go get 'em, Cal.
You got it!
Wait for your pitch, Cal.
Wait for your pitch, Cal!
Be patient.
Patient.
Be patient.
Play ball!
There's a high drive, way back and gone.
Cal Eason has done it again!
Hey!
Let's go, Shawn!
Let's go!
All right, Spencer, we're down by one.
Just get on base.
Come on, Brenda, bring me that weak sauce.
Bring it!
That a boy!
You got any more Creamsicles?
I'm going!
All right, hold on.
Hold up!
Hold up!
Hold!
Come on, Shawn!
No, no, stop!
What is wrong with you?
You're out of there!
Game over!
Son of a This guy.
What?
That is the worst call I have ever seen.
What do you have, dolls' eyes?
You mocking me?
No.
I am stating a fact.
You need glasses.
Last week you mistook me for Michael Chiklis.
That's because you were dressed like Michael Chiklis.
First of the month, Gus and I play The Commish.
You know that.
Don't blame me for your stupid base-running.
Even in sports, you've got no discipline.
I was safe by a yard and you know it.
You called me out because you were jealous.
Jealous?
Jealous of what?
I am something that you never were.
I am a bona fide star in the class C municipal Santa Barbara co-ed softball league, you son of a bitch!
That's it!
You're out of here!
You can't toss me!
The game is over!
I'm going to leave before he does anything truly embarrassing.
Too late.
Pick it up.
Suck it!
Out!
Get out!
- Suck home plate!
- You suck it.
Suck it.
You!
Want the last bite of my Creamscicle?
Yes, I would actually.
I bet you would.
That's messed up.
That was one hell of a swing.
Mel?
Mel.
Look at you.
My former bat boy all grown up.
Gus, it gives me great pleasure to introduce Mel Hornsby, manager of the Seabirds.
Oh, wow.
Sounds like the coolest job ever.
Minor league baseball team, not the actual birds.
Shawn, the reason why I'm here is I know, Mel.
I'm a psychic.
You need me to play shortstop.
No.
I want you to do some investigative work for me.
Slash play shortstop.
No.
I definitely don't need that.
Look, I am willing to move positions only because it's you, but I'd like to pick my spot in the batting order.
What do you need investigated?
My longtime hitting coach, Grady Barrett, dropped dead the other day of a heart attack.
Oh, no.
Wow.
I'm sorry, Mel.
Grady was a good man.
Yes, he was.
But there's a little bit more to the story.
They found a large amount of amphetamines in his system.
Greenies, as we call them in the baseball world.
Yeah.
Greenies?
That doesn't sound like Grady.
Do you think someone on the team slipped him drugs and murdered him?
Perhaps.
Whatever happened, I just need to know.
The man was like a brother to me.
Yeah, of course.
We'll help you, Mel.
But in order for me to investigate properly, I'm going to have to get on the inside, I mean, deep on the inside.
I'm not making you my shortstop.
Third baseman.
Utility infielder?
Lefty situational reliever?
You are right handed, Shawn.
Here's the thing, when I get hired by a professional sports franchise, it is customary that I go undercover as one of the players.
What if I make you a coach?
I could say you're my roving hitting instructor until the organization finds a new one.
I can rove.
I feel like I can rove.
And then I'll get to work with Cal Eason again.
That's right.
It's amazing.
After 20 years, he's right back where he started.
Poor guy.
We'll need to find something for my partner, Gus, here.
We're a package deal.
Well, we do have one position available.
Sounds good.
Yeah.
Come on!
Make him work up there!
Make him work!
Make him work up there.
Make him work.
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Are you kidding me?
You're killing it up there.
Hey, come on, Ump!
You call that a strike?
Come on, Ump!
You call that a strike?
You'll never get to the majors!
Never get to the majors!
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I'm not dressing up as that mascot again.
That was humiliating.
Oh, come on, Gus, you killed it, man.
Did you hear the crowd go nuts when you did the worm?
That wasn't the worm.
I'm sorry, the centipede.
It wasn't the centipede, either.
I was dealing with an itch on my stomach.
I think that suit has fleas.
So this is where Grady lives, huh?
Not bad.
Let's find these drugs so we can put an end to this stupid case.
We're not going to find any drugs in there, Gus.
What?
If Mel says Grady was clean, that means he was clean.
All I know is that people who die with drugs in their system are usually the ones who put drugs in their system.
Check it out.
Come on inside.
You know what, man?
Doesn't even bother me that we're spinning our wheels.
Gives me more time to work on getting my one professional at-bat.
That's not going to happen.
Ooh.
Macadamias.
I'm pretty sure those are old chickpeas.
Why would he leave those out?
Because he's dead.
That's no excuse, Gus.
Oh, look, Gus, Grady really did coach with some of the greats.
Picture of him and Tito Jackson in a baseball uniform.
That's Rod Carew.
Agree to disagree.
Keep looking.
I'm going to check upstairs.
Sounds good, bro.
Will you stop goofing around?
I'm not goofing around.
You're goofing around!
By the way, is it hot in here?
Not really.
I gotta be honest, man, it seems a little warm to me.
Let's see Nothing in the kitchen.
Are you feeling okay?
Actually I feel pretty terrific, like super duper focused.
Why are you staring at my ear?
I don't know, but I can't take my eyes off it.
Why are you talking so fast?
Why are you hearing so slow?
Why are you doing everything so slow?
Why are you so slow all the time, Gus?
You know we should get out of here, man.
If there were greenies in this house, I think we would have found them by now.
Dude, not necessarily.
Shawn!
What?
I had a friend of mine at the lab run a quick test on the water and it is, in fact, laced with amphetamines.
Now what made you suspect this, by the way?
Oh, no.
He memorized the entire owner's manual to my car on the way over here.
Hey, Jules.
Did you know that the Toyota Echo has a 1.5 liter inline, four-cylinder engine with multi-locking brakes?
What's wrong with Shawn?
He accidentally ingested speed.
Okay.
Are you working on anything we should be involved with?
Not yet.
Good.
Hey, it's the bald, blind umpire of Santa Barbara.
You were out by a foot.
Come on, you two.
Shawn, I think we should tell Mel Hornsby about the bottle.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's who you're working for?
Yep.
He hired me to investigate the tragic death of Grady Barrett and he made me a coach.
You're kidding.
Why didn't he contact me?
I've been a season ticket holder for 15 years.
Probably because he wanted somebody good, but I'm sure he appreciates the 40 bucks you shell out for those tickets annually.
Shawn, enough.
I need you to focus right now.
Buddy, I'm not sure I'm capable of anything else.
I'm locked in on your ear again.
Shawn, listen, I think Mel was right about somebody slipping Grady greenies without his knowledge.
I'm not so sure about that, Gus.
Dad, who wears number 42?
Izzy Jackson.
Organization's top prospect.
He signed a massive contract last year.
Sweet.
Let's go!
To where?
How long until this stuff wears off?
Hopefully in about half an hour.
Shawn, wake up.
Where are we?
At the address you told me to drive to right before you passed out.
Oh, man!
Those things will really slap you on the way down.
Why are we at a bar?
It's not just any bar, Gus.
It's the favorite hangout of the Seabirds.
For real, where?
The team.
Oh.
Why do I keep doing that?
Because you're a fool.
By the way, these guys have really taken to me.
I mean, they really love me.
I'm serious.
Ricky!
Good game today, man.
Thanks, towel boy.
You see?
We're just like family.
This is where I'm betting we'll find Izzy Jackson, the actual owner of that water bottle.
So he killed Grady?
Yeah.
But not necessarily on purpose.
He had a hitting session with Grady about an hour and a half before he died.
This is what I think happened.
Izzy's popping greenies to improve his performance.
They get their bottles mixed up during the session.
Grady goes home with the wrong bottle, takes a few more swigs, his old heart just gives out.
Wait a second.
Izzy's taking greenies?
Don't they test for that stuff?
Yeah, but it's pretty easy to get around those tests.
How?
I could pass one tomorrow by simply taking some of your urine, putting it in a cup and swapping it out with my urine.
I would not let you touch my urine.
You're not the friend I thought you were.
Well.
So, what's our plan?
Simple.
We approach Izzy, get him to admit to popping greenies.
That doesn't sound simple, Shawn.
Gus, don't be Pete Rose's haircut.
Izzy!
What's up, man?
What is up?
Shawn Spencer.
Yeah, we met earlier today.
I'm your new hitting coach.
Really?
I thought you were the New shortstop?
No.
Towel boy.
Oh.
Actually Hey, you're the new mascot, right?
You do a killer worm.
I actually had an itch.
Listen, Shawn, don't take this the wrong way, but I'm on a bit of a hot streak of late.
I don't want you coming in, messing with my swing.
Because I have a tendency to over-think things.
That surprises me.
But it doesn't matter because if it ain't broke, don't fix it, am I right?
Yeah.
God, you look so focused at the plate these days.
I mean, just really, really focused.
What are you implying?
Nothing, man.
Though if you were getting a little extra something from Uncle Greenie, I wouldn't be mad at that.
Lord knows I used it when I was playing.
Yeah, I never touched that stuff and I never will.
Well, I can respect that.
You know, I think this conversation is over.
Oh, come on, Izzy, the party's just getting started.
No, I said it's over.
Hey, settle down.
Take it easy.
Hey, hey, it's all good, Cal.
Hey, bartender, let's get another round of drinks for this man on me, all right?
This guy.
Shawn.
Let's get our drink on!
This guy Yeah!
Whoo!
It's never wise to mess with a drunk idiot, Shawn.
You should know that.
Oh, man, are you a sight for sore eyes, Cal.
Man, I can't believe you're back here playing for the Seabirds.
Yeah, nor can I. After the Rangers cut me, it was either sign up here or get some lousy job like selling pharmaceuticals.
That's a noble profession.
Well, you look good, man.
Real good.
I gotta tell you, I've been a fan, a big fan over the years.
Well, listen, I appreciate you being such a big fan and all, but I'm not sure I'm worthy of it, especially after the career I've had.
Are you kidding me?
If it wasn't for your knees, you would have been a perennial all-star.
You hit over 300, all four years in Baltimore, your 36.2 percentage for thrown-out base runners was one of the best of your era.
You really are a fan, huh?
I gotta tell you, man, I would do anything to get back into the big leagues.
I just feel like I got something left in the tank, you know?
You bet your butt you do.
I'm going to help you get back, Cal.
You are not a real coach.
You're not a real person.
And you will be catching again in the bigs in no time.
Well, I appreciate your enthusiasm, Shawn, but if it is going to happen, it's not going to be as a catcher.
My knees can't take it anymore.
What I got to do is I got to transition to first base, but I got that drunk moron ahead of me.
Wow.
That's actually impressive.
It's disgusting.
Yeah, Mel wants me to whip him into shape.
I don't know.
Care to dance?
I would absolutely love to.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Could he be any more awesome?
Shawn, how are we going to prove Izzy's taking greenies?
I don't know, man.
There's gotta be a way to test this guy.
Izzy, we have a game tomorrow.
You have another one of those, you're going to end up whizzing yourself again.
Hey, drunk No.
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No, Shawn.
Oh, excuse me.
Can we have another round of drinks for my boy Izzy there?
And some shots.
Keep them coming all night long.
Big night for him.
Big.
Whizzy.
Not again.
Stealing the pants off a drunk guy for a urine sample?
Really, Shawn?
Hey, hey, look for the record, he removed them himself, okay?
I just hooked them with a stick and ran off as he tried to set Gus on fire.
That guy parties hard.
Hey!
I am your coach!
I am not the towel boy.
I have my own windbreaker!
Yeah, well, it was a hair-brained idea, but shockingly it worked.
The lab was able to run a test on the urine found on the jeans.
Nice.
And?
The guy had a blood alcohol level of.
29.
He was loaded.
Okay.
What about greenies?
No.
Nothing.
Where's Jackson?
I'm sorry.
I haven't seen him, Mel.
Shawn, if Izzy wasn't taking the pills himself, maybe it's time to consider that he was trying to kill Grady.
Damn prima donna.
Eason?
Yeah.
You're starting tonight.
First base.
All right.
There's one more possibility.
If Izzy tested positive for amphetamines, how long would he be suspended?
First offense, What I need to do is transition to first base, but I got that drunk moron ahead of me.
I gotta tell you, man, I would do anything to get back into the big leagues.
Last night, you said, "Let's steal this guy's pants and the investigation will be over".
Look, just for the record, usually when I say that, it turns out to be the case, okay?
I just need a little more time.
For what?
To prove that the drugs that killed Grady were placed there by Cal.
I know.
He's trying to get Izzy suspended so that he could take his playing time.
Doesn't that suck?
The man used to be my idol.
You know what really sucks?
Being a classically trained tap dancer and being forced to dance The Macarena in front of a bunch of liquored up townies while wear a flea-infested Seabird suit.
Since when are you classically trained in anything?
This is the last game that I'm doing, Shawn, and if these folks want The Macarena, they're fresh out of luck.
Say it ain't so, Cal.
What are you talking about?
Man, I believed in you.
You believed in me?
That's right, because I believe in a lot of things.
I believe in fresh tennis balls, the healing power of bunnies and that the novels of Susan Sontag are something I'll never read.
In fact, I don't even know who Susan Sontag is.
What is she, like a painter?
I believe in Crystal Light because I believe in me.
I believe in the movies of Val Kilmer, though these days it ain't so easy.
I believe in Darren Sproles, the word dabble, the first season of Silk Stalkings and big, warm, moist, gooey, chocolate chip cookies that melt in your mouth and all over your face.
Finally, I believe that you secretly tried to drug Izzy so that you could steal his playing time, you son of a bitch.
Oh, my.
That was a stupid speech.
Can you deny it?
Let me tell you something, Shawn.
First of all, Izzy doesn't need any help getting in trouble, okay?
Secondly, if I was cheating, I wouldn't be stuck in A-ball.
Wow, you really got a hold of that.
You suck!
It's called real dancing.
You suck!
Something just bit me.
Stop!
Stop!
Get!
Get!
Get off!
Shoot!
Shoot!
Shoot!
Let's have some good at-bats out there!
Good at-bats out there!
Since when did you chew tobacco?
I don't.
This is all pretzel, my friend.
Snyder's of Hanover.
You want a pinch of this?
No, I'm good.
Now batting, number 35, Wilson Henze.
You have any updates for me?
Let's just say I'm zeroing in on a suspect.
Good.
Because I don't know how much longer I can keep up this charade.
All season.
Turn your back, the GM of the whole organization is coming.
Hey.
Mel, I'd like a word.
Why isn't Izzy Jackson playing?
Manager's decision.
I mean, the guy shows up two hours late to the park.
It's not the first time.
He has a major attitude problem.
I don't care.
My scout's here, so I want him playing.
Is that clear?
Yeah.
Jackson, you're batting for Henze.
Batting for Henze.
Cal, you're moving back to catcher.
Back behind the dish, Cal.
Sorry.
Oh, man, that guy gets on my nerves.
Had it with him.
Now batting, number 42, Izzy Jackson!
Next pitch is a curveball.
Doubt it.
Strike!
How'd you know?
I have the gift.
How about the next pitch?
Ah, it's a slider.
Izzy!
Jackson, who's been hot lately, has not had good luck against Holander.
There's a long drive.
Oh, that's going to carry.
Gone.
It's a home run.
Thanks, towel boy.
All right, all right, who wants a T-shirt?
Who?
This guy?
Who wants it?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, Seabird, you can't dance for crap!
Dance with this, buddy.
Want some more?
Gus.
Gus.
Dude, I think I know who did it for real now.
Good.
Then can you bust him so we can get the hell out of here?
First, I need to make an apology.
To who?
Hey, Ump!
I need a time.
Time!
Hey!
Hey, you can't do that.
Oh, this can't be good.
This is something you rarely see, the pitcher is getting a visit from the hitting coach.
What the hell are you doing?
Cal, damn it, man, I'm so sorry.
I was wrong to accuse you of trying to sabotage Izzy.
The whole time, it's been Ricky.
And he's trying to get Izzy back for sleeping with his wife.
Ricky isn't married.
Yeah.
You sure about that?
He was awfully lovey dovey at the bar the other night with that smoking hot, filthy, slutty blonde in the red.
Hey, that's my wife.
Look, Rodriguez, I need you to focus on pitching strikes out here, okay?
What's going on?
Ricky's sleeping with my wife.
And Izzy, too, possibly.
That's an issue for another time.
She told me she was going to the movies with your wife the other night.
That's what Lilly told me.
So if she wasn't at the movies either, where was she?
You guys really get around.
Oh, man.
This has got to be the weirdest mound meeting I have ever seen.
Good talk.
Come on, Rodriguez, come on.
Yes?
We're all good, Mel.
Looks like we're ready to get back to the action here with the Seabirds up 2-0 in the top of the sixth.
He throws the ball at Izzy Jackson.
No.
You come back here.
Well, in all my years, this is a first.
A bench-clearing brawl consisting of one team.
Gus, what Everybody, calm down!
There's no reason to fight.
There's no reason to fight.
You think this is Shawn's doing?
No doubt.
Break it up.
I'm too old for this crap.
Fight, fight, fight!
I guess now's not the best time to talk about me pinch hitting.
That, men, was a total disgrace.
Total disgrace.
Only a bunch of damn idiots fight on the field with their own men.
Bunch of damn idiots.
Will you stop that?
Sorry.
There's going to be some major changes around here, do you hear me?
Izzy, where do you think you're going?
I'm out.
It's Friday night.
Hey, I had enough Get back over there.
Damn it, I said get back here.
All right, guys, listen, about the changes Mel referred to, I will be hitting third tomorrow.
On Where is he?
Where is he?
Yeah, this ain't over, Cahoon.
Come on.
Where's Mel?
He just went after Izzy.
Thanks.
By the way, I don't know who you are but you're fired.
I'm your new hitting coach.
No, this is the new hitting coach.
That's Wade Boggs.
Oh, my God.
Gus, Gus, stop it.
Wade Boggs is here.
Do you have any idea what this man has accomplished?
For 17 seasons, he ate chicken before every single game.
I also won five batting titles and was a 12-time all-star.
Grilled or crispy?
Very funny.
No, no, Gus never kids around about food.
Nope.
Mostly crispy.
Wow.
That's impressive.
See what I'm saying?
Wow.
Can we go already?
Yeah, just as soon as we apologize to Mel.
You mean after you apologize.
Dude, check it out, I stole Wade Boggs's belt.
Why?
Because he's Wade Boggs.
Poor Izzy.
You guys really believe I hit Izzy Jackson over the head with a baseball bat and killed him?
Well, we've got 10 of your players that have gone on record saying that you had it out for the guy.
And you were seen running after him minutes before his death.
I wanted to give him a piece of my mind.
I'll admit that.
But I never found him.
Hey, you guys gotta believe me.
We don't.
I believe him.
I mean, why would he hire us to investigate his players and then kill one the next day?
Throw us off the trail.
I agree.
You'd say anything to keep from wearing that Seabird suit again.
I cannot deny that.
It does make sense, Shawn.
He wants Izzy off the team.
What does he do?
He tries to get him to test positive for drugs.
And that doesn't work, so he snaps and kills him.
Come on, you know how many jerks Mel's coached over the last 30 years?
He didn't kill any of them.
This is a reach.
Really?
Then why did we find a bag full of amphetamines in his apartment this morning?
Greenies.
I'm sorry, Shawn.
I can't believe it.
Hey, Dad, Mel bat lefty or righty?
Righty, why?
Yes.
Izzy was hit from behind on the left.
Now you tell me how a right-handed hitter could have done that?
Easily.
Swinging back-handed.
Are you kidding me right now?
It's like you want Mel to be guilty.
Come on, let's go talk to Woody.
Mel needs your help.
Oh, yeah, he needs my help now.
Why didn't he call me in the first place?
Oh, my God, this is about him hiring me instead of you.
I have been a season ticket holder for 20 years, Shawn.
Oh, he'll call me up when he needs a speeding ticket fixed, but call me for real investigative work?
Nah.
Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?
Yes, I do, now that I've said it out loud.
So, I've put together a demonstration for you guys, but I'm going to need a volunteer first.
I have to warn you, it involves me whacking you in the head with this baseball bat.
No takers.
Well, thank God, I packed a watermelon for lunch.
Ooh.
Woody, how is watching you hit a watermelon going to help us with the case?
Well, Gus, first of all, watermelon is high in vitamin C, which is good for the brain.
That's true.
And secondly, it will support Shawn's claim that Mel didn't kill this young man.
As you can see, excuse me, Gus, the fracture on Izzy's skull is nearly four inches, which means that somebody clubbed him hard.
Harder than a 60-year-old man swinging back-handed would be capable of.
Correct.
And that will be clear once I do exactly that to one of your heads.
I mean, this melon.
And keep in mind I am well south of 60.
I'm no slouch at the plate myself.
I was all-coroners' league for three seasons.
Played the hot coroner.
I also embalmed Sparky Anderson.
One of my thrills.
Woody, can we just get on with it?
Of course.
Okay, batter up.
Here we go.
Yeah, I'm going to state the obvious here.
This is a complete waste of time.
I agree.
Mel did it, plain and simple.
He's the only one with the motivation to kill him.
You can do this, Woody.
Here we go.
Nailed it.
First of all, Izzy doesn't need any help getting into trouble.
We, as an organization, are devastated over the death of Izzy Jackson.
Our hearts go out to him and his family.
Excuse me, Mr. Spencer, I've been given instructions not to let you on the premises.
Cheryl, I only need a minute to get the rest of my things.
You got one minute.
You're a good woman.
What things?
What the hell are we doing here?
Gus, the bat that killed Izzy was 35 inches.
The only player on the team that uses that size was Cal.
So you think he killed him?
No, of course not.
I'm sure he has a logical explanation for all this.
Hey, where's Cal?
Gone.
His locker was cleared out when I got in.
Where you headed, Cal?
Where do you think I'm headed, Shawn?
Oh, I don't know, Canada, maybe.
Some other lawless country where the authorities won't be able to catch up to you.
So I see I've gone from being your idol back to cold-blooded killer?
Just like OJ and Jamie Farr.
Jamie Farr never killed anyone, Shawn.
You're so naive.
All right, this is where I'm headed.
Oakland.
Oakland, Oakland?
They called me this morning.
You're going back to the show?
And we're back.
Cal!
Wait a minute, why weren't you in the locker room when Izzy was killed?
I was having my knees iced by the trainer and yes, he can confirm that.
Oh, I will never doubt you again.
Damn it, Cal!
Oh!
I wish that was true!
Oh!
I'm so proud of you, man.
I'm just so proud of you for playing your way back.
Yeah, well, it has nothing to do with the way I play, Shawn.
I was the cheapest option.
Nowadays, it's all about the money, Shawn.
You take care.
Psych.
Hey, buddy.
Shawn, where are you?
And why do you sound muffled?
Must be coming down with something, buddy.
I'll call you later.
Wait, Shawn!
What's happening, baby?
Afternoon, Mr. Guster.
Oh, you hear about Pluto?
That's it.
Ow!
There's been a break-in in the main office.
Hey!
Come back here!
Stop!
Look out!
Here comes the pain!
Shawn, where are you and where is my car?
I'll explain it all when I see you.
I'm only a couple minutes away.
What are you doing?
Driving around for a bit to make sure no one was following me.
Your left blinker is out, by the way.
Get this, I have some good news and some bad news and some good news.
Here's the good.
I know who killed Izzy.
What was the bad?
The killer may know I'm onto him.
And what was the other good?
He may think that me is actually you.
What?
How is that good news?
I meant good for me.
Hello.
Gus?
You still there or what?
I know you think that I know stuff, but I can assure you that I don't.
In fact, if you promise not to shoot, I can take you to the guy who really knows stuff and then you can shoot him.
In fact, I may even help you.
Come with me.
Come on, man!
I don't know anything about this.
I'd be happy to bring you up to speed.
You're right, Gus, this suit does have fleas.
It's very unpleasant.
You were the one who broke into our offices.
Indeed, I was.
And while I was there, I did some pretty interesting reading.
Gus, did you know that Neil here is the youngest GM in team history?
And that his first big move was signing Izzy Jackson to one of the richest rookie contracts ever to the tune of $12 million dollars?
Wow.
Yeah, that's pretty bold.
I believe in taking risks.
Yeah, you do.
But this one hasn't quite worked out for you, has it, Neil?
You see, Izzy's immature and, worst of all, he can't hit a curveball.
Which is a problem that simply doesn't go away.
Now luckily, most of the money was to be paid out after Izzy's promoted to the big leagues.
Certainly you weren't stupid enough to guarantee that promotion after 60 games.
No, wait, you were.
If I didn't offer him that, another team would have.
Yeah, if the team shelled out $10 million more dollars to that stiff, you knew your career would be toast.
So what did you do?
First, tried to rig it so Izzy would fail the drug test.
And that didn't work.
Then you tried to trade him to anybody.
Even the Pirates weren't interested.
I guess just injuring him would have been, what?
Too Too Tonya Harding-ish for you?
So you took the ultimate step.
You killed him.
Really?
I deserve to say that, Gus.
Did you hear all the pipe I laid to get that?
And you were going to pin it all on a guy who managed the team for 30 years.
I dreamt of being a GM my entire life and I wasn't going to let Izzy Jackson ruin it.
Move.
Come on, Neil, you'll never get away with this, man.
You're not a killer.
You were already spotted breaking into my office.
I'll explain that I acted in self-defense.
Nobody's going to buy that.
My alibi should be the least of your concerns right now.
Drop it, Neil.
You're not going to shoot me.
Why aren't you in Oakland, Eason?
I was gearing up for the game and something just kept eating at me.
Mel couldn't have hit Izzy because he bats right-handed.
Came back on a hunch.
Turns out I was right.
And all you brought was a baseball bat.
I said it was a hunch.
Give me a break, huh?
Come on, Neil, you're not a killer.
No, we already tried that.
We're about to die, Shawn.
Oh, no, we're not.
Wade Boggs is here.
What the hell?
Whoa.
Get out of here, Wade.
Hey, you're the guy who stole my belt.
Yes, sir, I am.
I can't shoot Wade Boggs.
Chicken.
Nice, Dad.
Wade Boggs, I'm a giant fan.
I am never coming back here.
Hey, Wade, when is Steve Garvey getting in the hall of fame?
Fair question.
That's fair.
Now remember, extend those arms, Shawn.
Keep that back elbow up.
The elbow's fine.
No, it isn't.
Keep it up.
You know what, Dad?
I think I'm going to go with Wade Boggs on this one.
Why?
He's been retired for All right, Shawn, what's this all about?
Mel, great.
Look, I'm going to prove to you once and for all that I have the skills necessary for at least one minor league at-bat.
You disagree, all you gotta do is tell me I'm not good enough, I promise I'll never bother you again.
Sounds like a deal.
"Sounds like a deal," he said.
You heard it.
All right, Rodriguez, you bring me that soft stuff.
Bring it to me like soft bread.
Keep your head down, Shawn.
Elbow up.
Okay.
I didn't quite get all that.
You're not good enough.
Let's go, Wade, we got a game to plan for.
Oh, come on, Mel.
Give me one more shot.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be managing in the prison leagues.
I appreciate all your help.
So, is it true you once drank 64 beers on a team flight to the West Coast?
That's something I'm not proud of, Mel.
Besides, that number gets distorted each and every year.
So Seventy-three.
Let your old man have a couple of cuts.
Man, you got an underhand setting on that thing, Rodriguez?
Hey, how'd you know it was Neil, by the way?
I didn't.
I got to the ballpark early for the game, saw a guy pointing a gun at you.
I'm so tired of that happening.
Why don't you try to swing without your gut looking so large?
You know, I must say, I've enjoyed working this case with you.
Yeah, yeah, I guess it brought us together and whatnot.
Yeah.
Yeah, baseball's good that way.
Hey, what's my wife doing?
Wow.
It's time that dude got a new lady.
Yeah.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Hey, Shawn, how was your day?
Oh, the usual.
Well, I'm headed up to my room to play Legend of Zelda.
Got a call from your school a little while ago.
Uh, you did?
Mmm-hmm.
It was the nurse and she said, and I quote, "Shawn tried to get himself declared insane today".
Huh!
That's weird.
Wow, I must have been in a weird fog or something.
Well, the good news is I'm feeling much better now.
No, no, no.
Shawn, it's not that simple.
Now your principal wants to have a discussion with me about putting you on Ritalin.
Oh, that's not necessary.
Let's consider this an isolated episode.
Hey, I'm home now, I'll get some rest, we'll pick this up tomorrow.
Didn't you have your quarterly project due today?
Ah!
Did I?
Like I said, everything was such a blur.
Kitchen table, now!
Call the school and tell them you'll have your assignment there first thing in the morning.
Let me get this straight.
Lassie solves a case without any help and he throws a party for himself to celebrate?
I am proud of him and I think that his hard work should be congratulated.
I'll eat to that.
You'll eat to anything.
You know that's right.
So, I'm the only one that thinks that this whole affair is a little over the top in the self-congratulatory department?
How so?
Well, for starters, he made that banner himself.
Yeah, but the craftsmanship more than offsets the megalomania, Shawn.
All right, fine, he put crime scene photos above the punch bowl.
It's called theme-ing.
You need to fold that pita.
I know what I'm doing.
Make it into a canoe.
Don't tell me how to eat.
Damn it!
Have you considered the fact that you might be a little bit jealous?
Why?
Because Gus has dip on his pants and I don't?
No, because Carlton solved a high profile case without any help from you.
I wouldn't exactly call it high profile.
A billionaire businessman has an affair with his assistant.
She tries to break it off, and he strangles her to death.
It's been in the news for months.
Thank you for making my point.
I'm making the exact opposite of your point.
Everyone's attention, please.
Hey, everyone.
Shut your pie holes!
Mmm.
Channel 23 is doing a story on my case.
Bernie Bethel, the brilliant, reclusive hedge fund manager, stands accused of murdering Sheila Hanson in what prosecutors are calling a crime of passion.
Mr. Bethel has nothing to say.
Bethel has been on trial for the last six months, and his lawyer, Phillip Zurn, is using the insanity defense.
Would you believe that Bethel's trying to pretend he's nuts?
You're going to do 50 years hard time, Bernie!
Uh, does he think the TV can hear him?
At this point, it's a strong possibility.
Here is Bethel's brother, Daniel, just outside the courthouse earlier today.
I'd like to express my deepest sympathies to the Hanson family.
It's all very tragic and our family's dedicated to finding answers to my brother's condition.
And now let's turn to our exclusive interview with the Santa Barbara Police detective Shut up.
Shut up.
Who broke this case wide open.
Detective Lassiter, take me step by step through your investigation.
What the hell?
There better be a massive pileup with casualties.
The jury in the Bernie Bethel case, in what I can only describe as a stunning victory for the defendant No.
Just found Bethel not guilty by reason of insanity.
No!
The verdict is an absolute travesty of justice.
I am as outraged by it as you.
Bust my ass to nail this guy and now he gets to stay in a cushy mental hospital talking about his feelings instead of rotting in prison, busting rocks and building the cross-country rail road.
Wow.
They can sentence you to go back in time?
Lassie's right.
That hospital is more like a resort than a jail.
And only people with serious connections and money can get in.
It's also a huge account.
If I could supply just their chlordiazepoxide needs, my numbers would explode.
Now is not the time.
There's always time for business, Shawn.
Carlton, you ran a flawless investigation, but now that Bethel has been sentenced, he can't be tried for the same crime.
It sucks, but there's nothing else we can do.
Refuse to accept it.
And I do.
I refuse to accept it.
Nor do I. Spencer, why are you even here?
I'm here to try and right this terrible wrong.
I don't need your help on this.
What I need is for you to stay out of it.
You weren't even on the case.
Maybe I should have been.
And what does that mean?
O'Hara, I understand that Bethel cannot be tried twice for the same murder.
However, now he's committed another crime.
He's pretending to be crazy.
Lassie, your theory is ridiculous and farfetched.
Why would someone possibly pretend to be insane?
So he doesn't have to go to prison.
Sold.
Look, I would love nothing more than to prove that Bethel is a fraud, but how do we do that?
The Chief sends me undercover into the psychiatric institution, where I gather evidence to prove he's a fraud.
Then we can overturn his sentence and send him to prison.
You interviewed him three times during the investigation.
He knows what you look like.
I'll grow a beard and wear nothing but tweed.
Carlton, the man is a genius.
He managed to fool a jury.
I don't think he's going to fall for you dressed as Lord Kensington.
And even if he did, the Chief can't open an investigation on a case that's closed.
Lassiter's instincts are good.
Bethel's ruse was easier to keep up for a jury than it will be 24I7 inside the hospital.
And, Juliet, you are right, the Chief can't officially sanction such an operation.
The good news is, as head of the consultants, I'm not bound by the same restrictions.
Henry Spencer, I don't know where you're going with this, but I love it.
If I can get Vick to sign off on an unofficial sting, I've got a friend in the mental health department who, uh, owes me a favor.
Now, all we have to do is come up with the right candidate to send inside.
That's my Daddy.
No.
Absolutely not.
I agree.
What?
Oh, come on, you guys, I'm the perfect choice and you know it.
I didn't work the case, Bethel never met me.
Shawn does have a way of, uh, sensing the truth.
And he's the only one of us who could actually pass for someone in need of institutionalization.
I'll take that as a compliment.
I wouldn't.
Lassiter, Shawn's our best bet at putting Bethel behind bars.
Damn it.
Fine.
But this is still my case and I'm running this operation.
And I insist, when we are done, he stays an extra 24 hours for psychiatric evaluation.
How about 48?
Done.
Ha!
I'm going in.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know You being locked up in here makes me queasy, Shawn.
What if they don't let you out?
Oh, don't worry, Jules, I have a keen understanding for the inside of mental hospitals.
Watching Girl, Interrupted six times does not make you an expert.
No, but seven does.
Gus and I Netflixed it again last night.
This is Dr. Abel Elliot.
This place is a fascist torture chamber!
Where's Lisa?
Where's Lisa?
It's from the movie.
You two are the only ones who get that.
Besides Winona Ryder.
Dr. Elliot is the chief of staff of the psychiatric hospital.
Doctor.
Burton Guster.
Central Coast Pharmaceuticals.
I'd love to talk to you about your psychotropic needs.
Oh, my gosh!
Are those Laker tickets in your pocket?
Dr. Elliot will be Shawn's contact inside.
He's the only employee privy to our operation.
Now for security, should any other staff other than Dr. Elliot try to make contact with you or anybody else at SBPD, we've never heard of Shawn.
I'm cooperating because Henry has some very influential friends.
But I think it's extremely doubtful that Bethel is a fraud.
He's been under my care now for several weeks, and if he's faking it then he's the best I've ever seen.
With all due respect, Dr. E, I, too, am a man of science.
See, I'm a psychic, and a damn good one.
I'm so good, it's stupid.
I'm stupid good.
Shawn.
The point is, I'm quite certain Bethel is a fraud, that he meant to kill Sheila Hanson, and I'm going to go in there and prove it.
You have four days inside, kid.
During which time you'll be required to blend in, participate in group therapy, and take meds.
I'm in charge of all pharmacology.
So I'll make sure all your pills are sugar pills.
Sweet.
Literally.
Dr. Elliot has come up with a cover diagnosis for you.
Your departmental profile suggests that the closest psychological identification for you would be narcissistic personality disorder.
It's handsome disease.
Our tech people put a hidden camera in the potted plant in the library.
You'll be given an earpiece.
It's hooked up to a monitor and a recording device in the hospital basement where Lassiter and I will be.
All I've got to do is befriend Bethel, get him to trust me and make sure he's in front of that camera when he exposes himself.
Right idea, wrong choice of words.
All right, let's get cracking, people.
The sooner we nail this bastard, the sooner we can get him behind real bars.
Uh, one last thing.
We're a little worried about you being in there alone.
So, for added security, we're sending Gus in with you.
Ah, great idea.
That way I can be with Dr. Elliot constantly.
Uh, my cover will be to land the largest account of my career.
And go to a Lakers game.
Uh, actually, we've got another job for you.
Really?
What's that?
Dude, this place has electronic bidets.
It's like the Westin for insane people.
Will you keep your voice down?
You're going to blow our cover.
I'm glad you're having a good time, Shawn, because I'm sure as hell not.
I don't know what you're complaining about.
You get to wear this sweet uniform.
And why do I have to be Suggs?
It was the only thing that would fit.
Besides, it's like Gus backwards.
You know I always have your back, Shawn, but this job in degrading.
I'm not too sure how much longer I can What is it?
Hello.
I'm Gus.
And you are?
Vivienne.
Nice to meet you, Vivienne.
Really, dude, not here.
I can cure her, Shawn.
You can't Well, Vivienne, is there anything you need?
Some apple juice would be nice.
Right this way.
Don't worry, Bernie.
I'm going to keep checking on you every week.
Here is Bethel's brother, Daniel, just outside the courthouse earlier today.
Uh, don't worry about it.
I'll bring more next time.
Okay?
McELROY: Group therapy will begin in five minutes on the lawn.
Dude, you smelling me?
It's a compulsion.
Ah, sort of like the, uh, scratching?
What scratching?
Who's this guy?
What's his story?
That's Longfellow.
He just got back from the second floor.
What the hell happens on the second floor?
What am I, your orientation advisor?
All I know is when you come back, you can't remember your name, much less what you had for breakfast that morning.
Hey, man.
Oh, sorry.
Look, I couldn't help but notice that you're trying to quit smoking.
How'd you know that?
I'm a magic man.
Really?
I can tell you a lot more about yourself, too.
Why don't you meet me after dinner in the library?
I'm going to bring dessert because I can tell that you are a Skittles man.
You can get Skittles in here?
I can do anything.
I'd like to begin today's session by introducing our newest member to the group.
Shawn Gthorndall.
It's pronounced Thorndall.
It's a silent "G".
Nurse McElroy, she has a mirror.
Didn't I tell you about mirrors?
What's his problem with mirrors?
He thinks they steal a person's soul.
You've got to stop scratching.
Would you just make her put it away?
I need you to calm down, Bernie.
Okay, let's talk this through.
You know I don't want to have to call over the orderly to restrain you.
Has he had his pill today?
He's been avoiding me all morning.
Get him one, please.
Your fear of mirrors is not reality based.
McELROY: It's in your imagination.
Good.
Now, let's get back to Shawn.
Tell us about yourself, Shawn.
Well, they tell me I've got something called, uh, narcissistic personality disorder.
But the truth is, this lustrous hair and dimpled chin are merely chapter one.
I'm a veritable cornucopia of high octane maladies, such as outrageous intelligence syndrome.
Huh?
And a little obsessive successful disorder.
Goodness!
I've never encountered a patient who suffers from so many diseases that don't exist.
Well, uh, they exist where I come from.
And where's that?
The future.
Yes, Wendell?
Shawn's full of it.
We're supposed to tell the truth here.
I don't expect you to understand, Wendell.
I'm talking about form, I'm talking about content.
We all know who the brown noser in the group is, don't we?
I just think you like listening to yourself talk.
Whoa.
And you look way too together to be in here!
I have the same robe everyone else has.
Uh, Shawn, you better come up with something quick.
You're about to get outed.
He's not sick.
I'm plenty sick, Wendell!
Pill time, everybody!
It's pill time!
Pills, come get your pills!
Orderly, restrain the patient.
You can't catch me, McElroy!
Yes, ma'am.
I'm going to keep doing this!
I'm going to keep driving around in circles until I get hungry!
And then I'm going to eat that fountain!
I'm like the ice cream man, except I have barbiturates!
You've only been here one day and they've already got you in restraints?
Oh, come on.
Dr. Elliot's only making me wear these mittens to protect my cover.
That, and I was concerned that Shawn really might be unstable.
Oh, you!
Oh, my God.
This was my fear.
My worst nightmare is coming true.
Jules, relax.
I'm right as rain.
Besides, Doc said I take these things off an hour ago.
Then why are you still wearing them?
The inner lining is so soft.
I think it's alpaca, maybe baby muskrat.
You've got to check these out.
I don't want to, Shawn.
You're going to be sorry.
Fine.
Wow, they are supple.
Try it, Lassie.
Enough with the stupid mittens.
They are quite soft.
What progress have you made with Bethel?
That dude is good.
Really good.
The way he ranted on about being terrified of mirrors.
Almost convinced me it was a real condition.
It is.
Which supports my belief that Bernie is truly sick.
The fear of one's own reflection is called eisoptrophobia.
Ooh, someone knows his stuff.
Then you must also be familiar with multiple personality disorder.
That's what Vivienne suffers from.
You know Vivienne.
The patient you've been inappropriately flirting with?
Now, Doc.
Gus can't help himself.
He's got a weakness for crazy chicks.
The last woman I was interested in turned out to be a murderer.
Oh, by the way, can I get those Lakers tickets back?
No.
I'm telling you, Bethel is a genius.
He's very well researched.
He's acquired a whole bunch of phobias for himself.
Fear of loud noises, fear of crowds, fear of saxophones, it's all bogus.
Spencer!
Yeah.
Don't worry, man.
I'm going to get this guy to confess on camera right after dinner.
I just need one thing to close this deal.
It is vitally important.
What's that?
Earpiece check, earpiece check.
Spencer, we've been waiting here for an hour and a half.
I think Bernie's a no-show.
Spencer, you're talking to the wrong plant.
Oh.
I thought for sure that the Skittles Still talking to the wrong plant.
It's the one on the table.
The table.
Lights out in 15 minutes.
We'll have to pick this up in the morning.
Damn it.
Shawn.
Shawn, wake up, wake up.
Hey, man.
Oh, I was getting the best sleep I've had in years.
It's like these sheets are woven from strands of warm springtime sunbeams.
What are you up to?
I've been busy cleaning up after these slobs.
I'm sorry, Shawn, but insanity is no excuse for not having the decency to hang up your own towel.
Mmm.
But listen.
As I was heading toward the laundry, I just saw Bethel sneaking out of his room heading toward the kitchen.
Come on, man.
He probably just wants a snack.
Or trying to escape.
Come on.
Hey there.
Hello, Vivienne.
Who's Vivienne?
I'm Frank.
Frank?
Plumber from Lodi.
Hey, you want to come in?
Got the game on.
Um, no thank you.
But if you see Vivienne, can you tell her Gus stopped by?
Hey, where are you going?
Let me ask you something.
If a dude kisses a crazed woman who thinks she's a dude, is that the same thing as a dude kissing a crazy dude?
That is the most ridiculous thing you've ever asked me.
And yes.
All right, then.
No, no, you have to use both, both of them.
- Okay, that's weird.
- I see.
It is.
It is, Shawn.
What is he doing to the fridge?
I don't know, but why would Bethel do something insane when there's no one around to see it?
- Both of them.
- Both of them.
Gus, there is one thing we have yet to consider.
What is that, Shawn?
What if Bernie isn't faking it at all?
Guys, I'm getting some very strong psychic vibrations that we need to at least consider the possibility that Bernie is legitimately insane.
What?
Are you sensing something else?
No, no, no.
Just some water stuck in my ear from this morning's free swim.
They have a pool here?
Heated.
And a gym with full Nautilus, and a music room, and a leather tooling class.
Spoiler alert.
I'm making you a wallet.
Oh, my God.
This is worse than my nightmare.
You like it here.
I never thought you would stoop so low, Spencer.
Excuse me?
You just can't stand to see me winning, can you?
It galls you so much that I solved the Bethel murder without any help from you, you're going to throw a monkey wrench into my case.
Look, Lassie, I admit I've taken great joy in watching you fail in the past.
Numerous times.
Sixty-eight to be exact.
But this isn't one of them, man.
I truly believe that Bernie is deranged.
Guster, you were there.
Huh?
You were there.
What did you see?
Man, I don't know what I saw.
Yes, you do.
Look, all I know is I had to give an uncooperative Cherokee a sponge bath this morning.
So, the only person around here who I know is crazy is me for allowing myself to get roped into this nonsense.
Lassie, give me a chance to prove to you that Bernie is disturbed.
I'll get him into that library in an hour, and if I'm wrong, you can shove it in my face and mush it around for months.
I do enjoy watching you make an ass of yourself.
The possibility of getting it on video is too good to pass up.
All right, you've got one hour.
Bernie, buddy, I give you a rainbow.
Oh!
I told you, man.
Look at all those Skittles.
Oh!
Ooh, why don't we come over here and rest those dogs?
Ooh, yeah.
Oh, yeah!
Look at all those Skittles, man.
Yeah.
Spencer, move the camera to the right.
What's, uh, what's your favorite, uh, flavor there, Bernie?
That's too close.
Can you pull it back?
Well, I like grape.
Yeah.
No, no.
Now, move it back to the left.
And I like orange Just a little bit.
and I like Can you move it back?
No, perfect.
Just stop touching it.
And orange.
Yeah, that's pretty much all of them.
Lemon.
I've got to tell you, Bernie, uh, I believe wholeheartedly that you are insane.
All right?
Cuckoo.
Six fat, sweet nuts to the wind.
But there are people that don't, and because of that I need you to help me help you.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
You just, you keep eating and we're going to play a game that I like to call boo!
Bernie.
What's going on, man?
Why aren't you freaking out?
I'm not afraid.
What?
Isn't that great?
No, it's not great.
I'm not scared.
I knew it!
This is not great.
Can you stop?
Spencer, what the hell are you doing?
Turn the camera back to Bernie.
Is the new Twilight book in?
Not now, Frank.
What's up, girl?
Where you been?
This doesn't make any sense.
Why would he, all of a sudden, start acting sane?
Face it, Spencer.
You got played.
Bethel pulled one over on you.
I told you he was a genius.
But on the plus side, this just means that I am one step closer to proving that I was right and he's a fake.
And one, and two.
And you're a branch reaching up to the sky.
Bernie?
Yeah?
I was right about your quitting smoking and I was dead on about the Skittles.
So, you know I'm the real deal.
Right now, I'm sensing the cops are about to figure out you're a fake.
So, if you want my help, you better come clean right now.
Shawn, I am not a fake.
I really haven't been right these last few years.
That's why I never left the house.
But now, for the first time in a long time, I'm starting to feel like myself again.
There you are, Bernie.
It's time for your pill.
Thank you.
Orderly, I'd very much like to do a cannonball.
What are you doing?
How long does it take for anti-psychotic drugs to kick in?
About two weeks.
How long has Bethel been institutionalized?
Two weeks.
That's it.
He's sane because his meds have kicked in.
Maybe he wants you to think his medication is working when, in fact, there was never anything wrong with him in the first place.
Now, stay here!
Come on, everyone, reach out and grab that air.
Don't worry about it.
I'll bring more next time.
He put crime scene photos above the punch bowl.
Bernie?
Yeah?
Why don't you open your left hand?
I can't.
I have degenerative arthritis in that hand.
Since when?
Since the last few years.
What?
Are you telling me you haven't been able to use your left hand for a few years?
No.
That means you couldn't have strangled Sheila Hanson.
That's evidence that could have exonerated you.
Why didn't that come out in court?
Did your lawyer know about your arthritic condition?
The last few years have been a blur, and during the trial I was at my worst.
I couldn't say or do anything to help myself.
And people had to make all my decisions for me.
Look, man, I think he's telling the truth.
How do you know he's not conning you?
How do you know he can't use his left hand for sure?
Well, there's only one way to find out, isn't there?
Hey, Bernie.
Yeah?
Do me a favor and hold onto this would you?
Thanks.
Oh!
Oh, God!
Oh!
Oh!
Bernie.
Oh!
Oh, man.
Bernie, you're all right, man.
That didn't go the way you saw it in your head.
Not completely.
Orderly!
Restrain that patient.
I didn't It was an accident!
You know the drill.
No!
No!
No!
Are you kidding?
He never took my side, ever.
I remember once a tree fell over, smashed into the garage during a storm.
He told me it was my fault because I wasn't fully committed to the pruning process.
Excuse you.
Uh, we need to get out of here.
I happen to be making some serious progress here.
They just released Bethel from the infirmary.
But I love my dad.
It's about time.
They had him sequestered for two days, for what?
A little foot fracture?
Hey, Vivienne.
Hey, Gus.
I see you have not heeded Dr. Elliot's warnings about seeing Vivienne.
I like her, Shawn.
And no, the relationship is not perfect.
Relationship.
I mean, sometimes in the middle of a sentence she turns into a dude, but you know what?
Frank is very interesting.
Did you know he's a Gulf War veteran?
Do you know that you are quite possibly the worst orderly of all time?
I'll take that as a compliment.
You really shouldn't.
No mirror!
No mirror!
McELROY: Bernie, you have to take your pill.
No.
Now, come on.
This is what makes you better.
Take the pill.
Put out your hand.
What the hell is going on?
Why is Bethel back to being crazy?
Take your pill, Bernie.
Gus, it's a different pill.
McELROY: Come on, put that in your mouth.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's blue, but the edges are square.
Just keep it here until we get some water.
What would happen if they gave Bernie new meds for the last couple days that had the reverse effects of the ones that were making him stable?
Close your mouth.
It could result in psychotic behavior.
There you go.
Drink that down.
Very good.
I think someone in here wants to keep Bernie incoherent.
Who?
I'm in charge of all pharmacology.
So I'll make sure you only get sugar pills.
Dr. Elliot.
He's in charge of medication.
It must be him.
Why would Elliot want Bethel to stay insane?
That doesn't make any sense.
He's the one who put Bethel on the original dose.
Why would he want to reverse the process?
He wouldn't.
Unless someone was paying him to do it.
Someone with a motive to keep Bernie unstable.
And what would that someone's motive be?
- I don't know yet.
- No!
No!
Orderly!
Can I get some help over here?
No!
No!
Better do what she says.
No, no, no, no!
We've got to maintain our cover until I can figure this out.
I'll go confront Elliot, figure out who he's working for.
What are you doing?
I got this, Shawn.
Calm down and nobody gets hurt.
Oh, man.
Where's Shawn?
Still at the hospital.
Why did you leave him?
I was fired and immediately escorted off the property.
Fired for what?
Well, after I helped Nurse McElroy calm down Bethel, I ran into Vivienne, and one thing led to another.
And before you know it, we were holding hands, and then somebody ratted us out.
I have a feeling it was that weasel Wendell, but I can't rule out Frank.
Where's Spencer?
Still at the hospital.
Why?
His four days are up.
Shawn figured out that someone has been tampering with Bethel's medication to make him stay disturbed.
Probably Dr. Elliot.
He also proved that Bethel has arthritis in his left hand, meaning he couldn't possibly have strangled Sheila Hanson.
And we're supposed to believe any of this?
Wait, wait, wait.
If he has arthritis, why didn't that come out in the trial?
That's what Shawn asked him.
But Bethel said that he was in such a fog that he can't remember whether he told his attorney or not.
Well, we have to talk to that lawyer.
I mean, if there's even a remote possibility that he withheld evidence that could have exonerated his client, we have to at least question him.
Mmm-mmm.
Fine, I'll get my jacket.
And when you see Shawn, will you tell him to call me ASAP?
Sure.
What's going on here?
What happened?
We found you in a restricted area passed out on the floor.
Yeah, somebody hit me in the head.
It was right after I found Dr. Elliot dead in his office.
Dr. Elliot's not dead.
He's not even in his office.
He must be at lunch.
What?
No.
No, no, no, that can't be.
I saw him.
He was bashed over the head.
It was ugly.
Why First you were observed talking to a potted plant.
Now you're seeing dead hospital staff?
I'm recommending that your diagnosis be changed to include paranoid delusional.
Para No!
No, I'm not paranoid.
I'm not even crazy.
Look, listen, my real name is Shawn Spencer.
Okay?
I am a psychic detective working undercover for the SBPD.
Oh, really?
Yes, really.
I'm here with my associate Gus.
He's pretending to be an orderly named Suggs.
I see.
But he's psychic as well?
No, he's not psychic, he's a pharmaceutical salesman, but he helps me solve crimes.
Okay?
Oh, and he drives a blueberry.
Ooh, he drives a piece of fruit.
Well, that's very interesting.
We're going to need to get him on some stronger meds.
No, no, no, no, no.
Gus is real, all right?
I'll take you to him.
He's probably flirting with that hot chick, Vivienne, who, you know, thinks she's a plumber named Frank sometimes.
Okay, we're just going to keep you here a little bit longer.
No, no, no, no.
Hey!
You've got to listen to me!
Call Henry Spencer at the SBPD.
He'll confirm everything.
Let me out of here!
Thank you.
Knock knock.
Sorry to interrupt your meeting, Mr. Zurn, Mr. Bethel.
We need to ask you a few questions about Bernie.
Questions?
What kind of questions?
Oh, my God.
Has something happened to my brother?
No, no, no.
He's fine.
Actually, he's insane, or not.
It's hard to tell at this point.
Mr. Zurn, did Bethel tell you that he had severe arthritis in his left hand, making it impossible for him to have strangled Sheila Hanson?
There's something wrong with Bernie's hand and you knew about it and you didn't bring it up in his trial?
He complained a little about it.
But Bernie was always such a complainer.
Had I realized his hand was that bad, I would have gone for a not guilty verdict.
So, based on what you're saying, detectives, Bernie may be innocent?
It's a possibility we're looking into.
I can't believe you weren't more thorough, Phillip.
I did everything in my power to save Bernie.
Obviously, you didn't!
I'm starting to wonder what it is he's been paying you to do all these years.
All these years?
How long has Bernie been a client?
He's handled all my brother's business and legal interests for 10 years.
Mr. Bethel, may I speak with you outside, please?
So, you're saying that Zurn handles all of Bernie's affairs?
My brother's Phillip's only client.
Strange.
You don't normally expand your business after losing your only client.
Now that your brother's been institutionalized, who controls his fortune?
It's in trust.
Oh, thank God!
Dude, how did you find me?
I was cleaning out my locker when Vivienne saw me and told me where you were.
Wait, you are still Vivienne, right?
Who else would I be, silly?
Just checking.
Hey, you see me strapped in over here.
Oh, yeah.
What're you saying, you got fired?
Yeah, and I was like, "Aw, man, not my job, not my job".
But it didn't matter.
Well, I have even worse news.
What's that?
Doc Elliot's dead.
What?
He was murdered.
He obviously wasn't tampering with Bethel's medication, but he must have known who in here was.
And when he confronted that person, they killed him to cover up their tracks.
We need to figure out what they did with the body.
We need to get to Bethel.
Oh, whoa!
Hide.
Where's he taking Bethel?
I All I know is when you come back, you can't remember your name, much less what you had for breakfast that morning.
Second floor.
That's where they give electric shock.
Oh, no!
Gus, if they pump Bernie with enough volts, could they completely wipe out his memory?
It's possible.
That means he won't be able to say, much less prove, that he didn't kill Sheila Hanson.
We have to help him.
Yeah, we need to get Jules and Lassie on the phone ASAP.
Come on, man, they're not going to get here in time.
We need a distraction now.
I've got one.
Hey, Collins.
Dude, Frank is stacked.
Just for the record, I did not ask her to do that.
Want to help me do my laundry?
Dude, let's go.
All right.
As near as I can tell, Zurn does not have power of attorney over Bethel's trust.
So, these office improvements are not coming out of Bernie's bank account.
Unless he made arrangements for his cohort inside the hospital to be the one signing the checks.
The cohort who is tampering with Bethel's pills to keep him unstable.
When's the last time you spoke with Dr. Elliot?
Six hours ago.
And I just checked my messages, there was nothing from Elliot.
Shawn was going to talk to him.
Do you think he's Zurn's insider?
It's possible.
If he is, he could be dangerous.
As much as I hate to say it, it's time to get Spencer out of the loony bin.
Hello?
Right, okay.
That was the mental hospital.
Shawn just broke Bethel out.
That's your boyfriend.
I know.
Hello, Burton Guster.
Gus, what the hell is going on?
Hold on, Juliet.
Ah!
Hey, Jules.
Where are you?
Well, we stopped for smoothies.
Three Pineapple Razzmatazzes and, uh, a sanity boost for my buddy over there.
I don't have any American dollars.
Shawn, what the hell were you thinking?
You broke a convicted murderer out of a mental institution.
Spencer.
Oh, man!
I am going to relish watching you strung up for this one.
But right now we need to work together.
O'Hara and I think that Bethel's attorney's the one working with the insider to tamper with Bethel's meds.
Well, I can tell you it isn't Dr. Elliot.
He's dead.
May he rest in peace.
What?
Elliot's dead.
Yeah, don't worry.
I know who the insider is.
Who is it?
As a matter of fact, we're headed there right now.
Hello, McElroy.
We're giving the orders now.
It's time for group therapy.
I'd like to start today's session by introducing the newest member of our group.
Ah!
Miss Lavender McElroy.
Lavender?
Really?
My parents were hippies.
- Evil hippies.
- Aren't they all?
You know that's right.
Always setting stuff on fire.
Accidentally.
Tell us about yourself, Lavender.
More specifically, how you were paid by Phillip Zurn to alter Bernie's meds?
Maybe how Dr. Elliot found out about it and you killed him.
Or that you signed the order to send Bernie, here, through electroshock therapy to zap his memory.
Okay, I admit that I was paid to change Bernie's dosage and to give him ECT, but I did not kill Dr. Elliot.
I swear.
As far as this Zurn person goes, I've never even heard of him.
Then who are you working for?
Here is Bethel's brother, Daniel, just outside the courthouse I'd like to express my deepest sympathies to the Hanson family.
Don't worry, Bernie.
I'm going to keep checking on you every week.
Gus.
What?
Bernie was never faking.
What?
His brother Daniel was.
He was just pretending to feel sorry for the victim.
What are you talking about, Shawn?
You two should have stayed at the hospital.
How the hell did he get in?
You were supposed to check the house, Shawn.
I wasn't checking the house.
You know I was waiting over there to scare her.
This is all your fault.
Well, now I can see it all.
Younger, much less successful sibling covets his big bro's gazillions.
In Bernie's addled state, you convinced him to let you have power of attorney.
But then his girlfriend, Sheila Hanson, figured that out and you killed her and pinned it on poor Bernie.
And everything was going according to plan, until your cohort, Lavender, here, told you that his meds were making him sane.
So, you had her switch it up, and then Dr. Elliot found out and threatened to go to the police.
Get the hell out of my office right now!
I'm not Just get out!
And then you killed him.
I never wanted to hurt my brother, but now, thanks to you, I'm going to have to.
Everybody in the corner.
I blame you.
This is your fault.
This is your fault.
This is your fault, Shawn.
- No, no, you come over here!
- No, please!
No!
Quiet!
McELROY: I have cats!
I don't care about your cats!
He's adopted a whole bunch of phobias for himself.
Fear of loud noises, fear of crowds, fear of saxophones - McELROY: Please, don't!
- Just hold still!
No!
No!
McELROY: Let me go!
Shut up!
Shut up!
No, no!
Will you shut up?
Make them stop!
Make them stop!
Don't move!
Stop, make it stop!
Okay, Bernie, I'm on it.
Wait, wait, wait.
Not yet, Shawn.
My favorite part's coming up.
What?
What are you telling me, that you're a Kenny G fan?
A little bit, yes.
This song.
I've got to be honest, I've never minded this song, either.
You know that's right.
It's really, really smooth.
Groove to it, Shawn.
I don't know about grooving, Gus.
Make it stop!
Make it stop!
Make it stop!
- Turn it off!
- Turn it off!
Make it stop!
Ooh!
Oh, yeah!
Turn it off!
I'm sorry you're leaving, Gus.
It's okay, Viv.
At least your medication's finally working.
You're getting better.
They say I was suffering from multiple personality disorder and that sometimes I thought I was a man?
Yep.
His name was Frank.
A war veteran.
Good guy.
Shawn, I want to thank you for everything you've done for me.
You too, detectives.
Both of you, thank you.
Well, we've got more good news, Bernie.
But since this is Lassie's case, I'm going to let him do the honors.
Your sentence has been repealed.
You're finally going to get the care you need.
Thank you.
You know, there's no reason to thank me for helping you solve this case, Lassie, but now would be a great time to thank me.
Spencer, if you're looking for recognition, just do what normal people do and throw yourself a party.
Oh, I shall.
And this time, there will be a pony.
You know, I'm in no hurry to leave this place.
It's nice here.
Life is simple.
Don't you think?
It really is, isn't it, Bernie?
Mmm-hmm.
Shawn?
Yeah?
We're going.
Okay.
See you, Bern.
Don't you think?
Yeah, whatever.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Juliet.
Juliet?
Juliet, party's almost over.
I don't think Daddy's coming, sweetie.
He's coming.
I know it.
Okay.
But it's a little rude to stay in here all day.
And, hey, your clown's leaving soon.
He can't even juggle.
I knew it!
I knew it!
I knew it!
I knew it!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Hi, cutie.
Tell your folks to vote for Hank Pauper.
He's good So what's the story with these guys?
This group of thieves hit West Medical Supply early this morning, made off with a couple dozen oxygen tanks.
Because of the great oxygen drought.
Hold your breath, people.
Do your part.
They most likely stole the tanks because one would need a license to purchase them.
The street value for their take is about twenty-five grand.
It seems like a lot of risk for such a modest reward.
- Are they amateurs?
- No.
No.
They were very well armed, extremely efficient.
My gut tells me we'll be hearing more from these guys.
Okay.
Keep me in the loop.
Idiots.
What he said.
Okay, Jules, we're nervous about three things.
Gary Busey.
Gary Busey.
And your 30th birthday bash!
I made a small list of things you'll want for the party.
All I see is Gary Busey.
Beneath him.
Oh.
An inflatable bounce house, a slip and slide.
And I was about to add two ginormous ponies.
You mean horses.
Oh, look, you already got a card.
Who's it from?
Oh, it's, uh, it's just my dad.
He's in LA and he wants to come up and see me for my birthday.
Oh, that's fantastic.
I'll add him to the list.
Don't add him to the list.
Jules, we're talking about your birthday Shawn, we talked about this.
The subject of my dad is off limits.
Look, he missed most of my birthdays anyway.
It's really complicated and, well, he's just not really presentable.
Not presentable?
What does that mean?
I'll tell you what it means, Juliet has a problem and as the man, it's my job to fix it.
I don't think that's what it means.
Gus, there are certain things about women that no one in the world understands.
Except for me and NBC anchor Brian Williams.
When a woman complains about a personal issue, she doesn't want the man to just listen, she wants him to solve the problem.
I don't think that's right, Shawn.
I'm telling you, man, when they say one thing, what they want is for us to do the exact opposite.
I strongly disagree.
Watch and learn from the master of women.
Look, you What the heck was that?
Who knew it would be so easy to sneak onto a private golf course?
Definitely not me.
Is that Juliet's dad?
I hope so.
Hey, fellas!
Great day for the hot links, huh, fellas?
You don't look like Tito Nagasaki and Bob Jones.
I've been told on many occasions that I'm the spitting image of Tito Nagasaki.
And if this guy doesn't look like Bob Jones, well, I don't know anything.
Yeah, well, Tito and Bob were supposed to meet me for a round of golf and then a business talk.
Apparently they're not showing.
Ah, right.
Shame.
Well, sir, my name is Shawn Spencer.
This is my partner, Ingle Woods.
We're on a mission of sorts.
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
I'm dating your daughter, sir.
Pleasure to meet you, Shawn.
Likewise, sir.
Why don't we play a few holes and then, uh, have a few drinks back at my chateau?
Come on.
Chateau.
Mr. O'Hara, as a budding entrepreneur myself, I was wondering, how did you make your fortune?
Work.
More hard work.
And you, Shawn, as the man who's dating my daughter, how do you earn a living?
I'm a psychic detective, sir.
I was asking a serious question.
I know it must sound a little crazy, but the truth is, sir, I have a unique gift and I use that gift to make the world a safer place for your daughter and ginormous ponies, that apparently we're just calling horses these days.
For instance, I am sensing that you're about to embark on a long voyage.
On your yacht, perhaps to a far away and exotic place.
Yes.
I purchased a home in the Caribbean.
My apologies.
That's a very impressive talent you got there.
Thank you, sir.
Come and join me.
This is very, very special stuff.
One of life's great pleasures.
- Smooth.
- Yeah.
So, Burton, how long have you been a single man?
How do you know I'm single?
How much time do you have?
Seriously, why haven't you seen your daughter in 15 years?
I put my heart into my work.
Look around you.
You can see the results of that focus.
Truly amazing.
Meaningless.
I'm now dedicating my life to repairing those important moments in my life.
And I would like nothing more than to share all my success with her.
Mr. O'Hara, I am here to broker a reunion between father and daughter.
See, I've reached out to Jule, but unless she responds, I think it's wise to stay away.
See, sir, I think that would be a mistake.
I know how Juliet feels.
I didn't speak with my father for many years and I know it creates a void in your life.
I'll say this, I can and will help orchestrate this reunion.
Why are you smiling like that?
It's a secret.
Mmm.
Okay, I'll tell you.
Your father's coming to your birthday.
I arranged the whole thing.
We.
We arranged the whole thing.
Mmm-hmm.
You did what?
He arranged the whole thing.
I specifically said that I didn't want him here and I meant it, Shawn.
Yeah, but I thought you wanted me to do the exact opposite of that.
Why would you think that?
Because I know women.
Do you have any idea how completely inappropriate it is that you went behind my back and invited him here?
Yeah, but I only did all of this to show you that you're completely wrong.
He is totally presentable.
He's got a giant house and a yacht.
He doesn't have any of those things.
Gus, back me up here.
He's rich and awesome and powerful.
He's not rich and he's not powerful.
He's a conman.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know Security cameras disabled.
We're going in.
Ten seconds.
Hello, boys.
Good to see you, Jimmy.
Relax, Gus.
So Frank fooled us.
Big deal.
It happens to us once every seven days.
I don't like being taken behind the woodshed, Shawn.
Thank you.
Thanks, buddy.
I'll be damned.
Congratulations.
You're a conman.
I prefer confidence man.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I'll have you know that I've been referred to as a modern-day Robin Hood by many of my colleagues.
Really?
You rob from the rich and give to the poor?
I con from the rich and give to myself when I am at my poorest.
Aren't your colleagues also conmen?
Yes.
You know what?
I'm going to do the right thing and return that scotch that we drank.
$25,000 a bottle.
I'll write an anonymous letter.
You lied to us, Frank.
That wasn't your chateau.
That was some poor stranger's house you were probably in the middle of cleaning out.
The stranger's name is Dale Fern, one of the most corrupt CEOs in corporate America.
That doesn't make it right.
No, it doesn't.
What makes it right is I gave everything back.
It's criminal to leave a house like that sitting empty.
I'm telling you the truth here, I miss my daughter.
And I have recently, and I accept the fact that it was only 11 hours ago, turned a corner.
I'm going straight.
What are you You honestly think that Gus and I were born on the Fourth of July?
Or yesterday?
Or to run?
I'm sorry, Frank, I can't help you.
But Shawn, it was your influential words that convinced me to earn a relationship with Juliet.
Okay, I'm back in.
I can help you.
Not me.
I'm out.
Excuse us.
Hey, hey, hey!
What?
Behind every great man is a great woman.
And in my case, that woman is an intelligent, sophisticated, full-foreheaded stallion named Burton.
And she's black and she can dance.
I need you on this, buddy, because tonal shifts are tricky for me and this is getting all serious.
Come on.
Foghorn needs Leghorn.
They're the same rooster, Shawn.
Exactly.
Fine.
Frank!
We're good.
Ground rules, we ease into the situation with Jules the same way that Gus eased into being black.
Am I the only one who's somewhat nervous about bringing a criminal into the police station?
Just to clarify, my record is clean.
I've been in the biz 30 years and I've never been charged with a crime.
All the same, I think that we, meaning you, shouldn't say a single word.
Of course.
All right.
Just act natural.
All right, everybody, listen up.
The band of thieves who we've been after finally pulled the score that they've been planning.
They busted one of their low-life friends out of prison.
As you can see, they used an extremely high-powered pure oxygen blowtorch which they stole from West Medical Supply yesterday to cut through Here's a picture of the escapee.
That's Jimmy Fitz.
Oh, my God, Frank.
What are you doing here?
Who's Frank?
My father.
Your what?
Shawn, Gus, I can see you.
Surprise.
No, no, I'm not Gus.
Um, I'm his cousin.
His cousin, uh Okay, I'll be with you shortly and we're going to have words.
Now, as I was saying, Jimmy Fitz was serving three years of a 10-year sentence.
We find him, we most likely find the rest of his crew.
Now that these guys have accomplished their mission, they're gonna lay low.
We need to jump on this scent before it goes cold.
That's not going to happen.
Frank.
Not now, Frank.
I'm sorry, Juliet.
Our personal business aside, let me just say this one thing and I promise I'll be quiet.
I'll zip it up.
I swear.
Fine.
Jimmy Fitz was one of the most talented safecrackers in the business.
I think these guys are going to pull a big score.
Otherwise they wouldn't risk breaking out a guy with Jimmy Fitz's talent out of Lompoc.
They need him to complete the score.
How does your dad know so much about this?
I'll be having those words with you now.
Um, since I'm not really involved with this Oh, you're not going anywhere, Gus.
Jule, I understand you're upset.
Just so you know it's not Shawn's fault that I'm here.
Nor mine.
Nor Burton's.
It's true that Shawn did say some meaningful words that had a great deal of influence on me And of course, if they hadn't been spoken I'd be halfway to the Cayman Islands by now, but you can't blame him for this.
Frank, I'm not sure this is helping.
Well, I have some words that I hope will have an influence on you.
I don't want you here.
And I have 30 years of reasons why.
So I will do the respectful thing and leave it at that.
I understand your feelings.
But I've turned a corner.
And how many corners have you turned over the years?
Still counting, right?
May I say something?
I know I'm in the doghouse.
Oh, you're not in the doghouse?
I'm not?
No.
You're going to have to work really hard to make it into the doghouse.
Okay, so I'm in the yard, which is still an enclosed area.
Unless I'm in the pound.
Jules, am I in the pound?
Where's Gus?
Is Gus with me?
Why do I have to be in the pound?
So we can get adopted together like two inseparable weeny dogs.
I don't want to be in the pound, Shawn.
Guys.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was just going to say that Frank seems very sincere about wanting to rebuild his relationship with you.
You know, you're right.
I always go about these things the wrong way.
I shouldn't have rushed in here.
I'm sorry.
Look, can I just Can I just have a little time to think about this?
Maybe I'll call you.
Uh, Jule, you know that Jimmy Fitz only pulled a score with two other guys?
Yes.
Ricky Roma and Chad Emigh.
Did you know that Ricky joined the invisible choir?
He's in the fertilizer business?
He's dead.
Ricky's dead.
Chad is the leader of the crew that you're looking for.
Your dad was right.
We just got word that a place called General Industries was hit.
Three masked men in and out, took a bunch of construction equipment.
Heavy-duty drills, diggers, that sort of thing.
Drills, diggers Those guys are going to make their score in the next 24 hours.
I guarantee it.
Goodbye, Frank.
Tell me again AutoTrader.
Com?
Trust me.
They have a ton of new cars.
Why don't you just let him borrow the Blueberry?
Come on, son, what will I drive?
Well, he's right.
And I mostly borrowed people's cars who didn't know they were being borrowed.
No, it's time I stepped up and bought myself a new car for the first time.
Frank, I don't think you should leave yet.
Listen, I want to spend more time with Juliet but I don't think her feelings are going to change and I don't blame her.
I'll take that one.
It's a $300,000 Bentley.
Everybody will take that one.
Here, how about this one?
It's a little more practical.
Has Wi-Fi.
Then that's the winner.
What's Wi-Fi?
Hey Jules, what's up?
You're kidding me.
We're on our way.
So there's been complaints about construction noise downtown, right?
There are dudes drilling in the middle of a parking lot.
City never issued permits for the work.
That sounds like our guys.
Frank, you were right again.
Great job.
Let's go.
No, no, no, no.
I'd better respect Juliet's wishes.
You know, she's right.
I'm not officially on this case.
Well Dust that thing.
Wow.
Really?
Don't tell me.
They broke into a safe.
No.
They took an entire safe.
They were able to bypass a top-notch security system because they went underground to do it.
Look, showing up at the station is one thing, Frank, but this is a crime scene.
I thought I was clear before, the only people allowed here are the people working the case.
But Jule, I am working the case.
What are you talking about?
Shawn, what is he talking about?
This is awkward.
Okay, Jules, when a man truly knows a woman Shawn.
Gus hired your dad.
You must be out of your damn mind.
He hired your dad.
Okay, we hired your dad.
I can't believe you hired my father!
For the record, I did not hire your father.
Well, you're in this, Gus.
You're in deep.
You're an accomplice.
In fact, if this were a crime, you'd be in cuffs right now.
Jules, the truth is we just needed an extra set of hands around Psych.
Our old assistant Kung Ken.
Who we fired twice, will not return my calls for some reason.
It's no great loss.
Your dad just happened to be around.
It is extremely frustrating to be constantly ignored.
In fact, it's getting a little hurtful, Shawn.
Okay, I only did this because your dad is so desperate to spend more time with you.
And by helping with the case, I think he thinks he's making up for the mistakes, you know, working with the good guys for a change.
You don't know him like I do.
Look, Jules, I know I don't know him the way you do, but what I do know is Frank is well aware this is a very sensitive situation.
He knows the best thing to do is just lay low.
Has anybody got a megaphone?
I'm not very good at projecting.
I used to have the same problem, sir.
What you want to do is breathe through your diaphragm.
Oh, my God, this is not happening.
O'Hara, your father has his finger firmly on the pulse of this case.
You know this isn't repairing our relationship, right?
Jules, I'm trying to assist you on this case.
Let me just say a few words and then I'll take a backseat.
Fine.
Make it quick.
Okay, so here's what we know so far.
Crew we've been following, led by this guy on the right, Chad Emigh, stole a top-of-the-line safe this evening.
And we now know that the safe contained legal papers from a big law firm, nothing of any real value.
Well, maybe they were after the information in the safe and not the money.
I don't think they cared what was in the safe.
Jimmy Fitz is the safecracker on the crew, right?
He's rusty from the time he spent in the pokey.
He probably just wanted something to practice on.
That's very good, Shawn.
Thank you, Frank.
No, thank you.
All right, let's zero in on what the big plan is.
We got to figure out what these guys are after next.
Well, we can forget about banks.
It's federal, means the FBI.
No, we're looking at something privately owned.
Auction stamps, jewelry shows, venues that move from city to city.
Those silly coin expos you go to, do they really have coins that are worth more than their face value?
Of course they do.
The Santa Barbara Expo has a featured coin every year worth millions.
In fact Oh, I'm getting something!
Oh, boy.
Uh, Santa Barbara Coin Expo.
That's right.
It travels from city to city with a boatload of privately-owned, very valuable coins.
The star attraction this year is a nineteen Valued at $2 million.
Only a dozen of them in existence, and even though I do love me some 1913 liberty nickel, I have to say that That could be it.
I'm proud of you, Shawn.
- You are?
- What about me?
I knew the exact year of the coin.
Spoken like a man with no girlfriend.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you, Frank.
That light little pat on the buns was exactly what I needed to get over the hump.
Man, I wish you were my Little League coach.
Hey.
Hey, I was your coach in Little League.
Really?
That short-fused, balding guy was you?
We have no evidence they're going after the coin expo.
It's true, but until we have a better lead, it's worth checking out.
So you mean to tell me someone might want to steal the fascinatingly rare worth two million bucks from my coin expo?
That's right.
Well, butter my buns and call me a biscuit, I'm shocked.
Shocked.
This is not my first coin show, kids.
No, but it might be your last if they rip you off.
I'm not worried about it.
And why is that?
Because, hello, I do this for a living and I use top-notch security.
I use decoys, I use smoke screens and I use my smarts, all to outwit lowlife crooks.
I have a question, Sheldon.
How much is this puppy worth right here?
Exactly ten cents.
How much will you give us for it?
Two nickels or maybe ten pennies or just a different dime.
What do you think?
We'll take the two nickels.
Okay, are you folks done wasting my time?
No.
I'd like a list of all your employees, specifically the new hires.
What?
Why?
In case there's an inside man.
That's my girl.
Too soon?
Too soon.
It's worth 25 cents.
Man.
Will you stop it?
A real pro can get through this safe in two minutes.
Your coins are sitting ducks in there.
Please.
Have you not listened to anything I've said?
I certainly haven't but I didn't think you'd notice.
It's going to take a couple of days to go through all these people.
I told you I've had the same team of people with me for years.
There are no new employees here.
Then let's get to work.
Thank you, sir.
I'm shocked.
Shocked.
This is not my first coin show, kids.
I'm getting something.
Like a power outage or something electrical.
Yeah, we did have some electrical issues so we hired someone to fix them.
So you do have a new employee?
Well, no, he's temporary.
I don't count him as a real employee.
Nice work, Shawn.
Oh, no, good work from you, sir.
Let's just check that electrician, shall we?
The electrician's clean.
How do you know that?
Did you not just see the show I put on in there?
I was scaring myself.
Trust me, he knows nothing.
He knows something.
What?
Oh, my God.
Well, unless someone can get some information out of him, we have nothing to hold him on.
I remember a six-year-old who could charm her way into selling every last sip of the worst lemonade ever made.
It was sugar-free.
Jules, I've had your lemonade, it's pretty rough on the palate.
Sugar's a key ingredient.
I get it.
Trying to help.
Touchy.
Hey, Kevin, Juliet O'Hara, we met earlier.
How long have you been married?
Uh, three years.
Kids?
One.
A boy.
I have a little girl.
They're so much fun, aren't they?
What?
Jules has a kid.
What?
Shawn, she's playing him.
Oh.
I feel very silly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know what I think, Kevin?
I think these guys are the kind of guys that would kill me or someone like me if I got in their way, and I don't see that in you.
When I look at you, I see somebody who is scared and somebody who wants all of this to just go away.
And you know what?
I can make all of it go away.
Because they haven't stolen anything from the coin expo yet.
So if you can give me information that can prevent a crime from happening, then we are one giant step closer to righting whatever you've done wrong.
Some guy approached me and offered a couple grand if I gave him info on the building where the expo is being held.
Access points, stuff like that.
You know, I needed the cash to make ends meet.
That's my girl.
I want all resources at that expo immediately.
Yes, ma'am.
North and South Teams, report.
- Clear.
- All clear.
You okay, Frank?
I'm fine.
Why wouldn't I be?
There.
The guy with the black briefcase.
Suit and tie.
Black briefcase, red tie, take him down.
Unarmed.
Clear.
There.
Backpack, black hat.
West corner, backpack, black hat.
Go!
He's clean.
You sure?
Uh, are you sure that wasn't them?
Yes, they're sure.
Are you out of your damn minds?
Are you kidding me?
I'm not sure if you're aware, but coin enthusiasts are an easily scared group of mostly single men.
Not true.
Mr. Gates, just calm down.
There was a very good reason for Hang on.
Yeah, Chief.
No, no, we'll be right there.
A place called Prestige Safe Deposit was just robbed by a couple of masked men.
Sheldon, are you all right?
I use decoys, I use smoke screens and I use my smarts, all to outwit lowlife crooks.
No.
He's not all right.
Prestige Safe Deposit is where he keeps the real penny.
What happened out there today?
The other team played better.
Maybe I should go talk to him, huh?
I don't think that will be necessary.
You all right?
I thought I had them there.
Means I failed on every level.
I must have been crazy to think that I could I was guessing the whole time.
I got caught up.
I shouldn't have been there, Jules.
Hey, O'Hara, I've got the surveillance photos from the Prestige Safe Deposit robbery.
You want to see these?
I've done enough damage already.
As you can see, the crew is wearing gas masks.
The employees weren't an issue because they were drugged.
We found three tanks of nitrous oxide in the air shaft of the building.
These guys got in, unarmed, took the penny and made a clean exit.
These pictures are useless.
Why don't we play a few holes and then, uh, have a few drinks back at my chateau?
It's criminal to leave a house like that sitting empty.
What's wrong?
I'll tell you on the way.
Frank stole the penny?
Unfortunately, yes.
Wait, how?
He was with us in the van the whole time.
Yeah, but his crew wasn't.
He conned us, Gus.
He made us believe those thieves we were after were the ones who were going to steal the penny.
Meanwhile, Frank wanted it for himself the whole time.
He set this whole thing up so that the entire police department went down to that coin expo while his crew stole the penny from where it was actually being kept.
So what are the guys who we are after going to steal?
I have no idea.
Will you please just tell me you have a plan of some kind?
You're damn right I do.
Here, get on the freeway up here.
We're headed back to LA.
Well played, Frank.
Well played.
Get yourself a good night's sleep in another man's mansion and then take his yacht wherever your heart desires, right?
Take your electrician and your caddy along with you.
Hey, guys.
So let me get this straight.
You roll into town under the guise of patching things up with your daughter.
Meanwhile, you're planning a con the whole time.
No.
I came to town with every intention of making things right with Juliet.
Didn't hatch the plan to take the penny until I got inside the police station and, uh, saw this other crew of thieves pulling scores in Santa Barbara.
And I could take whatever I wanted and pin it on them because the police were listening to every word I said.
You gotta understand that something like this has never fallen into my lap.
Oh.
I just couldn't stop myself.
How did you know where the real penny was, Frank?
You know how.
You swiped the Prestige receipt off Sheldon's desk, didn't you?
Damn it, you have got to stop doing this to your daughter.
She was just starting to allow herself to believe that you were actually a changed man.
I know.
I know.
And I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize that.
- You could have fooled me.
- I want out.
I'm quitting this life.
But it's not that easy.
See, I owe outstanding balances that need to be paid and I'm not talking about MasterCard and Visa.
This was supposed to be a clean score.
My hope was that Juliet wouldn't know it was me.
So, what do you got?
The police waiting for me to take me away?
No, Frank.
No cops.
Go.
If a $2 million penny is more important to you than having a relationship with your daughter, then go.
Get the hell out of here.
You said the penny was worth 100 grand.
Pipe down, kiddo.
I'm going to give you till tomorrow morning to make things right.
Otherwise I'm telling her everything, Frank.
Okay, Gus, if Frank doesn't get here and come clean in the next six seconds, I'm telling the truth.
Can I wait in the car?
Hey, Jules.
Hey.
We got our guy.
Really?
Uh, let me explain.
We got an anonymous tip regarding the whereabouts of Chad Emigh.
He was sleeping in his hotel room, penny right on his nightstand.
An anonymous tip?
Yep.
It was the perfect bust.
We got all the evidence from his room, we are processing it now and we're about to interrogate him.
Wow.
You know, Jules, before you go in there, - I'm thinking - Hey.
We got our man.
That's my girl.
Still too soon?
Still too soon.
One day at a time.
Make this easy on yourself, Chad, just tell us where the rest of your crew is and maybe we can work out a deal.
No, I don't think so.
How about you put the arrogance on ice, moron.
Lest we forget, the stolen penny was found ten inches from your thick skull when we took you down.
You planted the penny on Chad.
This is a win-win situation.
Cops get their man.
We know he's a bad guy.
That penny goes back to that D-bag Sheldon, and, uh, Juliet is none the wiser.
I told you I have an alibi, so check it out.
It's legit.
I also told you that I was sleeping like a baby.
Someone removed part of my window, came in my room like a ghost and planted it on my nightstand.
You expect us to believe that?
You believe what you want.
Looks like she is the wiser, Frank.
What are you doing?
O'Hara?
Where are you off to, Frank?
Uh, nowhere.
Just thought maybe you could handle things from here.
You know, it's funny, after Mom kicked you out and changed all the locks on the doors, I always wondered how you would sneak into my room and leave little gifts on my nightstand.
And eventually I just figured out that you were really good at taking apart a window and putting it back together.
In and out like a ghost.
I don't know what you mean, Juliet.
God, you're such a coward.
There's no need for that.
Actually, there's a long overdue need for it.
Your life has been so starved of honesty that the second you feel it creeping around the corner, you are out the nearest door.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
It's not a feeling, Frank.
It's the truth.
I'm not done.
Look, I don't know if you've realized this, but I'm not a kid anymore.
And I'm not going to sit around and waste my time and my tears on missed recitals and birthdays, but what really breaks my heart is that you won't be there for all the moments to come.
You don't know that, Juliet.
Yes, I do.
Because that's my choice.
And I don't want you there.
You don't mean that.
Sadly, I mean every word because I feel cheated.
I feel robbed.
So congratulations, Frank, your longest con of all was on your own daughter.
Again, Jules, I'm super-duper sorry, okay?
I'm going to make this up to you.
I promise.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
You're a flawed man, Frank.
But we all are.
But deep down, I know you're a good man.
- Gus, what the hell?
- Oh.
What's up?
Not a lot.
Juliet is still pretty upset, and to make matters worse, they had to let Chad go.
His alibi checked out and they only have circumstantial evidence against him.
Oh, yeah, and they confirmed an eyewitness report of a middle-aged man rummaging around a bush outside Chad's hotel room.
So there's that.
Hmm.
Bummer.
That means Chad is free to pull off his score while I'm pulling off my con.
Yeah, that really is a bummer, Frank.
We got an anonymous tip regarding the whereabouts of Chad Emigh.
Wait a minute.
I just had a vision of Chad attending three very random concerts this week at the Santa Barbara Bowl.
That sounds like they're casing the place out.
Gus, I think we just figured out what they're going to rob.
Hey, can I come with?
I know.
I know, it's But if I actually help you bring them down Sorry, Frank.
No can do.
Not this time.
What you need to do is throw yourself at Juliet's feet and literally beg for mercy.
You're right.
Go get them, men.
Go get them.
Don't touch anything!
Nothing worth touching.
Jules, just hear us out.
We know what Chad and his crew are going to rob.
The Santa Barbara Bowl.
I had a vision of him attending three totally random concerts there.
He was casing the joint.
We did find a variety of concert ticket stubs in the evidence from Chad's hotel room.
We should bring Lassiter in and put together a plan.
Real and Don't do that.
You know what this is like?
This is like the end of The Town.
Which makes me the guy from Mad Men.
Gus is Affleck and Jules is Minnie Driver.
You just mashed up The Town with Good Will Hunting.
Hey, you're wicked smart, Guster.
Oh, thanks, fella.
That was kind of you to say.
What the hell was that?
That was dead-on Southie.
That was like Mister Ed if he was Irish.
Oh, that was kind of you to say.
Oh, my God.
What?
Juliet, I swear on Gus's life, we had no idea he was coming here.
You have to believe me.
I know I shouldn't be here, but Shawn said I should throw myself at your feet and beg for mercy.
Have you lost your mind?
You're compromising our entire operation, Frank.
Get in the van.
Frank, I didn't mean throw yourself at her feet in the middle of a stakeout.
Can I say something?
I would rather you didn't.
Is this going to get awkward again?
It already is.
I'll make this quick and then you never have to speak to me again.
I'm truly sorry.
The mistakes and decisions I've made are unforgivable.
I want to change, but obviously I have more soul-searching to do.
Despite my shortcomings, the one thing I can't live without is being there for the important parts of your life.
Well, you've already missed them.
They're gone.
You deserved first place in your fifth grade talent contest.
The only reason that bratty little Wendy Pence won was because her mother was flirting with the judge.
And that song you sang, Time After Time, was a beautiful choice.
You sounded like an angel.
And that clown juggler on your ninth birthday party, he was awful.
Criminal, just I have a lot of proud moments of you, Juliet.
But the proudest was when they swore you in and gave you that badge and I realized, luckily, you're nothing like me.
Why would you hide?
Well, when your mother remarried and I saw what a great stepdad that Lloyd made for you and the boys, I thought maybe I'd just stay out of the way.
And another part of me thought maybe you, uh, might be embarrassed if I showed my face.
I'm not embarrassed by you.
Disappointed.
But never embarrassed.
You have a lot of great people around you, very special people.
I don't know about him.
But very special.
So I'll You know, I'll go and you guys take care.
Red ball-cap, gray sweatshirt.
He's talking to his hand.
He's mic'ed.
He's one of the crew.
Being the closeted soft rock fan that you are, are you familiar with a station called 103.1- Surf?
No, I'm not.
Oh, boy, I'm getting something too!
Turn on the radio.
It's a dead station.
What?
If it's a dead station, why is there a KSRF 103.1 "The Surf" van parked out there?
That's them!
Should we call in the SWAT?
No, there's way too many civilians.
We can't risk the crossfire.
I have an idea.
Moving in.
Moving in.
Out of the van now.
Hands in the air!
Let's go.
It was a good plan, Dad.
It was the least I could do.
Almost, almost Okay, you can open.
Happy birthday!
Yay.
Where are the ginormous ponies?
You mean horses.
Yeah, apparently they're very expensive to rent and they poop a lot.
Oh, good call.
Thank you for this, Shawn.
Your heart was always in the right place.
Go have a blast.
Look who's here.
Mmm.
Thank you for coming.
Happy birthday, O'Hara.
Yeah.
Come here.
Not bad, huh, Frank?
So what's the plan?
You thinking of sticking around for a few days?
Yeah, I think I might.
I might even get a regular job.
Yeah.
Where is the penny, Frank?
I know the one in the evidence room is a fake and it's only a matter of time before they figure that out.
I don't have the penny.
What do you think?
Do you think this is my first surprise party for a girlfriend whose dad is a professional conman?
Huh?
It is.
It is my first.
Where's the penny?
The real penny is being put into the evidence room right about now.
Kato's breaking into the evidence room?
Kato is finagling his way into the evidence room.
Finagling his way.
Oh, my God.
Hey, what are you all talking about?
Gifts.
And cake.
Which one do you want to bust out first?
Cake.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Hello, Dad!
What is this, "Do Your Job Half-Assed Day" at the Santa Barbara Police Department?
We've got serious business to attend to.
Serious business?
You're going to the opening of a new cupcake store.
No, we're going to a closing of an old cupcake store.
And then we're going to the opening of a new cupcake store.
Bring me back red velvet.
Man, just give us our check.
Sign.
Just to your right.
That's That's Here you go.
Thank you.
I wanna die and come back as that peach scarf.
What?
I thought you wanted to come back as the skinny Elvis.
No.
You wanted to come back as skinny Elvis.
I wanted to come back as black Michael Jackson.
Now you're downgrading to a scarf?
You know that's right.
We will keep this report on file.
And if you need absolutely anything else, please don't hesitate to give me a call.
What's your number?
I was gonna ask you the same question.
Gus, please, this woman may have witnessed a crime.
A crime in progress.
She's stealing my heart.
But I ain't pressing charges.
Wow!
I would like to apologize for my creepy colleague.
No need.
I find his energy very soothing.
Really?
Your silhouette should be on a mud flap.
That's the weirdest flirting I've ever heard.
Burton Guster, P.I. My apologies for your traumatic crime-seeing experience.
Guys, sidebar?
Sure.
We'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere near this one.
Why is that?
Because Janis Joplin over there is crazier than Janis Dickinson.
I mean, this girl's obviously been doing a little too much of this Suffering from hemorrhoid pain?
Doing an inaccurate impression of Dr. Evil in space?
She claims she witnessed a murder in an alley right off of Main Street at the height of lunch hour.
That is crazy.
No chance of getting a table after that.
We checked with all the businesses in the area.
The only weird thing anyone saw was a girl in a peach scarf dancing off a Greyhound bus.
So?
That doesn't mean it didn't happen.
Look at the girl.
All right, she's been living in the hills.
She hasn't been down to the city in five years.
She meditated during the interview.
The only understandable thing in the witness statement was a doodle of three large circles.
Maybe a snowman did it.
Okay.
You've been warned.
Okay I don't know, man.
As much as I like to zig when Lassiter zags, I'm feeling pretty zaggy.
So what do you say we hit the museum of lactose intolerance like you've been wanting to?
No can do, Shawn.
I feel a case coming on.
And it's coming hard.
That's the creepiest euphemism of all time.
So, what did the killer look like exactly?
I don't remember, but it happened right over there.
Okay.
So, you didn't see the killer.
You barely saw the victim.
And you were the only one looking down the alley.
Wait, no, I do remember something about the victim.
He had a very heavy presence.
That's good.
It's not great.
Yes, for this conversation it is.
Oh, oh, I'm getting something.
Gus.
Over here.
Excuse me one second.
You think she's making it up?
I don't know, man.
I guess I think she believes it.
The only reason we're listening to any of this is because you have a crush on her.
Since when are you into granola chicks anyway?
First of all, do not try to put me in a box.
I'm a complicated man who likes complicated women.
And Brazilians.
Secondly, I've seen you take a case based on the testimony of a cat.
It was suspicious meowing, not testimony.
Don't be ridiculous.
Trust me, this girl did not witness a murder.
I've given it some thought, and I'm willing to reconsider.
You think?
Someone is after her.
No, Shawn.
She can't stay here at my place.
Oh, come on, Jules.
A car zoomed out of nowhere and almost ran her over.
On the sidewalk?
No.
Not exactly.
So, where was she standing?
She was, um Shawn?
She was in the area directly between the two sidewalks.
So, she was in the street.
Only sort of.
Did you get a look at the car?
Yes I did, dark blue sedan.
No license plates.
Or, license plates.
Look, I would really like to believe her, but she's making it very difficult.
And don't think I didn't see Gus doing that thing that he does with his lip.
This better not be some elaborate wingman act on your part.
Look, there are consequences on my part if I intercede at this point.
Especially in my own home.
You should know that.
So take her someplace secure, and we will check out the blue sedan and that's all I can tell you at this point.
All right, we'll go somewhere else.
Hopefully nothing terrible happens to us.
All right, I think we should go pretty far away.
You know, someplace completely off the map.
That way, at least you'll be safe while we figure this thing out.
I say we go north.
Can you be a little more specific?
Fine.
South.
Well, if you wanna go off the map, you can take me home.
I feel that.
Wait!
Go back inside!
All of you!
Down!
Down!
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know Ah.
It's very nice.
You live on a farm?
No, it's more than a farm.
Gus.
Gus, we may have a Children of the Corn situation happening here.
Oh, come on, guys.
Don't you like love?
I like love.
Gus!
Gus, drive!
Drive!
There are people around!
Plow through them!
They're smiling.
Fine, they'll die happy.
Floor it!
No!
Nicole!
Don't be a hero!
Gus!
Where you going?
No!
Just Welcome.
Welcome back, sister.
You two are sisters?
Sure, in that we are all brothers and sisters here.
Ahh.
All right.
So, you're not really sisters.
I mean, you're "sisters".
Cause, uh, I was thrown.
Because there's really no resemblance between the two of you.
Shawn.
Oh, we were so worried.
We were so worried!
When you didn't return from the bus station.
Oh, God!
Okay.
You know, when one of us is gone, the whole balance is off.
I haven't been regular all day, and that's just not like me at all.
Is it?
Come here!
Hey!
No!
No, I'm good.
Oh, no?
I'm yeah.
I'm good.
You should eat some roughage.
I know.
Maybe we can hug it out later.
I'd love to.
So, you guys aren't related to corn, in any way, shape or form?
Yeah, we like to think of ourselves as a intentional community.
Living together in peace and celebrating our shared values of cooperation, nonviolence, equality and ecology.
All under the loving guidance and leadership of Eli.
Welcome back, sister!
I tell you people, I woke up this morning and right away Something wasn't right.
There was a jagged-ness.
Who else felt it?
Come on, now!
Yeah, yeah.
I know this guy did.
I can see a glorious wind has brought back one of our own.
Eli, I saw something in the city.
She saw a murder.
Oh, little bird.
My poor, little bird.
I blinked.
I flipped.
I was completely useless.
She was brave.
And dreamy, if that matters.
Are these the heroes who delivered you safely to us?
I'm Burton Guster.
I am just a man.
A man who cares.
We think Nicole might be in danger.
We'd like to stay and protect her.
We would?
Yes.
That's funny, cause I was under the impression that this was more of a drop-off situation.
No.
Uh-uh.
See, we have tickets to a screening of Xanadu at 5:50.
I feel like a eucalyptus tree.
Normally, we don't take in strangers.
Perfect.
I would feel safer if they stayed.
Well, a brother of my sister is a brother of mine.
So, welcome, brothers!
Okay.
Everyone!
We have guests!
Welcome.
We've got three simple rules.
Keep your mind open, your heart pure and your plate full!
I hear that!
I'm afraid I can't abide by these stifling restrictions.
I'm sorry.
Let's eat.
Let's eat, huh!
Let's eat.
Huh?
Let's eat.
All right.
Exactly.
You don't find anything odd about this whole set-up?
Not really.
That's because you're too trusting.
It's like that time you bought that dwarf all those drinks in the ice bar because he told you he was a prince.
No, he was a prince in exile, and he lost his wallet.
I'm telling you, man, there's something seriously strange about these people.
Like what?
Like, maybe it's a cult.
It's a cult.
Let's eat.
Oh, my God.
Thank goodness you're okay, Shawn, I've been calling.
Well, I guess we were out of range, what's going on?
Shawn, you were right.
Somebody is after Nicole.
Some lunatic shot at my house like, an hour ago.
My place is a crime scene.
Holy crap, Jules.
Are you okay?
We're coming back right now.
No, Shawn, I am fine.
I wasn't the target.
But I'm pretty sure Nicole was.
We've extended an APB to surrounding counties.
We haven't heard anything, the shooter could still be in the area.
Please tell me you are somewhere out of the way.
Oh, yeah.
We're so far off the grid, I think we're actually back on the grid.
Okay.
I will get a protective order for the girl.
Just keep her safe until Lassiter and I can figure things out on this end.
Okay?
I will send somebody out there for you soon.
Okay, there's one problem.
We don't really know where we are.
Good.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe anyone would be up at this hour.
Not even animals.
Are we really protecting a witness in a cult?
It's not a cult, Shawn.
They grow their own food and make kick-ass hammocks.
You need to open your mind.
Man, you are in complete denial because you're smitten with Nicole.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
But I do like the girl, though.
All right, all right.
Listen to me, man.
I gotta say this.
Look, you know that I am okay with you doing your thing and putting a little vibe out there every once in a while, but I think lately things are getting out of hand.
Oh, no, it's not.
Dude, you gave a necklace to the FedEx girl last week.
That's because she kept stopping by for no reason.
She kept stopping by to deliver our FedEx packages.
All right, fine.
Fine.
Maybe I want somebody special in my life, too.
You ever think of that?
And if putting out a slightly stronger signal is gonna help, well, that's something I'm willing to do.
I'm not sure it's helping.
Agree to disagree, Shawn.
I can't move.
Neither can I. Let's pretend we're dead.
Hey!
It's morning ritual down by the Peace Ash.
So, I brought you guys some fresh clothes.
We are so there.
"Peace Ash"?
Hello?
Hello!
Shawn, why are you whispering?
Because I have to, okay?
I just am.
Such a waste of time.
Shawn, we are standing here on Nicole's street corner, and there is absolutely nothing.
I could really use your help right now.
Look, I can't just be psychic on demand.
Okay?
Right now, it's all I can do just to carry the tiger over the mountain.
Come on!
Tell your boyfriend goodbye.
Let's go get some pancakes.
Cloud hands!
This place is beautiful.
Isn't it?
I used to be a trust fund kid.
Nothing in the world meant anything to me.
When I signed the pledge of simplicity, my life suddenly became clear.
I'm finding some clarity myself and whatnot.
Shawn?
Are you even listening?
I mean Hey!
It's a red light!
What the hell was that?
I don't know, some jackass just blew through a red light.
But it happened right over there.
Okay.
Look, I'll get on the psychic thing, all right?
And, let me call you back.
And open, and close!
Excellent.
Bring on the day!
I really shouldn't be doing this, Shawn.
Yeah, well, Dad, I'm desperately trying to drum up a psychic vision here.
So a little help would be nice, okay?
Wait.
I can totally see your screen.
Look, I told you this would work.
I told you how to do it.
Two minutes ago you didn't even think it was possible.
Okay, listen.
I need to see any pictures the traffic cam may have taken between noon and 12:30.
That's when Nicole claimed to have seen this murder.
The victim has a face, a suit and a heavy presence.
You know, it's a real long shot that a car would blow a light at the exact moment your guy was standing there.
Dad, just look.
Otherwise Gus is gonna end up handing out lunchmeat at airports.
Wait, wait.
This may sound crazy, but I know this guy.
It's Dan Cooper.
This guy's a cop.
He's I.A. Internal Affairs?
Yeah, that's him, all right.
He's a crusader with a chip on his shoulder.
He's pissed off a lot of cops in his time.
Hey!
You're not supposed to be in here.
I know that, now.
It's a rule.
I That's the man I saw killed.
All right, check it out.
The guy who got killed was an I.A. Investigator named Dan Cooper.
I'm guessing whoever killed him was one of the officers he was investigating, because as you know, Internal Affairs isn't very popular with cops.
I have Jules looking into it.
These plums are God's candy.
Okay.
If God meant for them to be candy, then why did he invent candy?
Did you hear what I just said?
I'm trying to do my job.
Your job is to find out who tried to kill Nicole, not sell apples.
Shawn, you think every round fruit is an apple.
No, I don't.
Okay.
What are these?
Tiny apples.
And those?
Halloween apples.
These berries are green now because they were just pulled from the vine, but in a few days, they're gonna be this bright, beautiful red.
That's yeah.
Oh!
Terrific.
Now you have a beautiful day.
Seems like a lot of work for 75 cents.
Trust me.
You try rolling calls to a hundred clients, explaining why the Plainco fund is suddenly worth half its value.
Then you tell me which is more rewarding.
You were a hedge fund manager?
Oh, yeah.
Was a pretty big one.
Yeah, I had a beach house in Antigua, but none of that buys happiness.
No way.
That sounds awful.
Doesn't it, Gus?
Hey, weirdos!
How are things at the freak stand today?
Yeah, you see any double rainbows?
I will kick their redneck asses!
No, no, shh, shh.
Brother Gus!
Eli has taught us these kind of people need our love, not our fists!
We love you!
You love me, huh?
Even if I did this?
Yes, I do.
I don't, just for the record.
I don't love you.
Sweet.
But you, you're pretty cute, sunshine.
That's it, I'm gonna kill him.
I'm so torn, 'cause I don't want to be a part of this group, but I don't wanna be a part of their group, either.
Ah!
Mother of Pete!
One punch, Shawn.
No!
That's all I need is one punch, come on!
Come on!
Okay, buddy, one punch!
Careful.
Dude, this is like Footloose!
Brawling with townies!
That means I'm Bacon and you're Lori Singer.
Why do I have to be the girl?
'Cause you just swung like that.
You ready for this, son?
I'm ready for it!
Oh, my God!
Come on, boys.
Let's get out of here!
Shawn!
Shawn!
Are you okay?
We know you guys are busy at Internal Affairs, so thanks for coming.
We'll make this fast, March.
Believe me, I don't wanna be seen palling around with the head of Internal Affairs.
That's fine.
I don't need to be seen hanging with Carlton Lassiter.
You don't know me.
Oh, we know you.
Believe me.
Listen, this is regarding one of your officers, Dan Cooper.
We need to know who he was investigating.
Why would I tell you that?
Well, because we have reason to believe that one of them may have just killed him.
I talked to Cooper yesterday.
What evidence do you have?
Well, to be honest, our evidence is a little hazy.
Purple hazy.
Oh, okay.
Well, when it becomes a little less hazy, call me.
I'll check on Cooper.
Until then, I'm not disclosing who he was investigating.
You listen to me, you little snitch!
We're trying to help this Carlton!
Look, if there's anything you can tell us.
Look, Cooper chased paper trails.
Professional standards.
That's not the kind of stuff that makes real enemies.
As for you, Detective, we'll be watching.
Please, you don't have anything on me.
In '04, you discharged your weapon at a circus.
Twice.
Last year you put an 86 year-old shoplifter in full body restraints.
That old lady was feisty as hell.
And I've got the denture marks to prove it, bub!
Oh, no What else?
What else you got?
What else you got?
Are you nervous?
No, you're not making me nervous at all.
Am I making you nervous?
Hey!
What's with all the angry texts?
You blew your cover!
You're at a hippie farm?
How do you know that?
Box Canyon.
We got a report on the wire that you two got into a physical altercation with some of the locals.
What is that ridiculous sound?
That's my washboard, Jules.
I'm washing my bloomers.
Actually, they're not mine, per se.
They're Dot's.
Truth be told, they're community bloomers.
These panties are owned by the collective as a whole.
Clearly, Eli is out of original ideas.
Look, you guys are vulnerable.
The person looking for Nicole could know that you and Gus are with her.
Well, we don't know that for sure, Jules.
Look, do you have any good news for me, or just doom and gloom stuff?
Doom and gloom.
We hit a dead end at I.A. With your guy Cooper.
He's small-time.
Evidence-related paperwork.
Logging and inventory.
Wait, like, evidence inventory?
Yeah, why?
Bring me back red velvet.
That guy wasn't half-assing his job.
He didn't sign on purpose.
I'm getting something.
Pierce.
Officer Pierce.
I think that may be the cop that Cooper was investigating.
Okay, well, I will check it out.
Until then, I need you to lay low.
And make sure that Gus does the same thing.
Yeah, I will do.
As soon as I figure out where he is.
Hi, Shawn!
Hi!
That's creepy.
Nice house, Eli.
Creepy family, but nice house.
Hello, Sister Nicole.
Brother Gus, may I speak with you gently but sternly outside on the porch?
Sure, Brother Shawn.
Gus, what the hell is wrong with you?
Brother Shawn, don't come at me with anger in your voice.
Hey.
Kill the "Brothers" thing!
You were using them.
Yeah, as a joke.
You're using them for real.
I use them all the time.
Because you're a black guy.
You know what Eli says?
That's anger from previous lives that was never set free.
What are you talking about?
It makes sense.
Clean living with higher thinking, Shawn.
I think they've found a higher way of living.
Okay, stop it.
Just You stop it.
You have been sucked into this thing because Nicole is pretty in a Kate Hudson from Almost Famous sort of way, and you're you.
Burton Oh.
Don't be jealous, Shawn.
You know what they say, love is abounding and is for everyone.
True, Nicole is beautiful, but she is merely a vessel for that love.
Right.
And true, that vessel is smoking hot and sometimes bathes in an outdoor shower Really?
Yes, but we cannot possess love, Shawn.
That kiss was not just between her and me.
It was with everyone.
Right, I would leave you here, but I owe it to your parents to see this thing through.
Burton I appreciate this talk, Shawn, but it's time to get transcendental and rejoice in the wonder of the day.
Wonder?
Hello?
You were right, Shawn.
It was Pierce.
We caught him in possession of drugs stolen from evidence.
No kidding.
Yeah, we got him to cop to it.
He tried to make a run for it, but now he's in custody.
He's been doing this for months now, working alone.
Lassiter's confident we can get him to confess to the murder of Dan Cooper and lead us to the body.
Yes!
Jules!
This is amazing!
It means I can get the hell out of this place, and that Gus isn't gonna end up robbing a bank in a beret with a machine gun.
What?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey, buddy?
Gus?
Come on.
We're out of here.
Don't bother me, Shawn.
My aura shield is up, which means my prana vayu and my apana vayu are in the midst of harmonizing.
Correction, were in the midst of harmonizing.
My bad.
That's my bad, clearly.
I just wanted to apologize for earlier, and tell you that I too could use some harmony.
So Why don't we rendezvous at the Peace Ash and reconnect with our, uh, Shoshanna Lonsteins?
I do love me some Peace Ash.
See?
That's what I'm talking about Hey, Nicole.
Bye, Nicole.
Let's go.
I'm pretty sure the Peace Ash is back the other way, Shawn.
Yeah, well, I'm taking a short cut.
Doesn't seem like a short cut to me.
That's because it's a short cut the heck out of here.
What?
Gimme that ridiculous thing!
What are you doing?
I'm going home, Gus.
You tricked me.
Hey, isn't that the same car that tried to run down Nicole?
Yes, but it doesn't make any sense.
Pierce is in custody.
That means Pierce isn't the killer.
And the killer just got here.
Nicole!
Nicole!
Nicole!
What are you doing, trying to summon every Nicole within 50 miles?
One of you gonna hand me a towel?
She seems fine.
Yeah.
I'll get it.
Okay.
Oh, good, you made it.
We got here as soon as we could.
Thank you.
Great directions, Spencer.
If it wasn't for the fetid stench of unwashed hippie pits, we might never have found this place at all.
We are not hippies, sir.
We enjoy the serenity of isolation.
And I welcome you.
I'm Eli.
You may call me Eli.
This is what our troops have been fighting to protect?
The right not to wear brassieres?
You like what you see, Slim?
Back off, Squeaky Fromme.
Spencer, where's this car you were talking about?
I don't want to spend one more second with these do-nothings than I have to.
ELl: We're hardly "do nothings".
These are some of the most successful members of your malfunctioning society come together.
And this is a fully operational farm.
Oh, I'll bet it is, Cheech.
How about I bring some pals down from the DEA and we help with the harvest?
Shame!
Shame!
If we're all done making friends here, why don't I stay with Nicole and you guys go check out the car?
Great.
Why, thank you.
Love.
Love.
Come here.
Come here, come.
Come.
Please be careful.
The killer's here, somewhere.
Gus.
Love, love, love Gus?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Love, love, love No plates, no registration.
We'll have to run the VIN by the DMV.
Gus, check out the tiny apples.
The berries are green now because they were just pulled from the vine, but in a few days, they're gonna be this bright, beautiful red.
Ripe and ready to eat.
That means the killer didn't just get here.
He's been here the whole time.
Eli, I'm gonna need to interrogate your entire herd of weirdos.
You're gonna treat us all like criminals?
There is your problem, sir.
Come with me.
I have a much more effective ceremony which all my brothers and sisters gather in the barn and speak the truth.
Dare I even ask what you call this flowery gathering of nonsense?
The Barn of Truth.
Okay.
I know we don't do this very often, but sometimes we need to purge ourselves of our secrets, maybe some lies.
So let's keep it loose, speak freely, get it all out in the open, and then get together for a community hug and send these outsiders on their way.
Milosh, my man, the gourd of transparency please.
This is your left shoe, Milosh.
The gourd.
I need the gourd.
Oops.
Okay.
Thank you.
Remember, if you want the floor, you must hold the gourd.
Now, who'd like to get something off their chest?
I do.
Of course.
This is beyond ridiculous.
Thank you.
Hi.
I've had a series of deliciously impure dreams where I'm dumping out cold butter, sugar, raw eggs, flour and chocolate chips all over the exposed body of that man.
This is a rough moment for me.
We have a history.
That's not He washed my bloomers.
Okay.
They were community bloomers.
I told you that on the phone.
And I was assigned those bloomers.
It was a work assignment from Eli.
They were so clean!
Okay.
That was great.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Okay, very good.
Anyone else?
I'd like to give Can I have a go?
Do what you want.
Ahem.
I have to tell them the truth, Nicole.
When you went to Santa Barbara, I know you weren't going shopping for bobbins the other day.
I know you were going to see a man.
Okay.
Well, actually, it wasn't like that at all.
We exchanged notes.
But we never actually met.
I got there, I got there half an hour early, and then I saw that terrible thing happen so, we never even met.
Yeah, I know that she went to the computer.
I read her e-mails.
Okay, well, all he wants So, she's a constant No, actually, I have the gourd.
All he wanted to do was talk.
Oh?
Really?
Give me the damn gourd.
Oh, because I'm sure that Loudlrish@TFI.com was simply gonna drive into the city to chat it up in an alley.
The truth.
Okay.
Okay.
Of course!
Okay?
Truth?
Truth?
The truth is maybe I do miss the outside world.
Okay?
But all he wanted to do was ask me questions about this place, that's it, if you really need to know.
Okay?
It's not a big deal.
Okay, okay.
I'll tell you what he wanted.
What he wanted was to walk hand in hand with you with each other's hands Okay, okay.
In your back pockets.
That's what he was looking for.
No!
That's great.
I have the gourd.
I don't even I have the gourd.
Okay.
Thanks, that's great.
Maybe when we get two gourds we can work that out.
That was really interesting.
Thank you for that.
Really putting it all out on the table.
You went to meet a man but didn't.
We move on.
Wait a minute.
That e-mail address Hold up, if you want to speak, you have to score the gourd.
You're kidding, right?
I never kid.
You shut up.
That e-mail address, it belonged to Dan Cooper.
I saw it in his Internal Affairs file.
That means the man that Nicole went to visit is the same man that she saw killed.
What?
No.
No, that's not possible.
He never said anything about being a police officer!
He didn't.
So upsetting Dead man was a cop.
I had no idea!
You have to believe me!
He found my Facebook page.
Really?
That's funny.
I thought you guys didn't have stuff like that.
We don't.
It's sort of a secret.
Did you change your relationship status?
Cooper was his name.
He reached out to me.
He said he had questions about my life here, like maybe he was looking for something missing in his life.
I understood that.
You know, he was sweet, like Burton.
That's how I do it.
He never sent me a photo of himself.
We set up a place to meet, he said he would find me.
Then I saw the murder and I fled.
I never thought it was the same person, that's the truth.
I swear it.
Why didn't you tell anyone about this?
Because it's complicated.
People might get the wrong idea.
Right.
I know that she went to the computer.
I read her e-mails.
You're pretty cute, sunshine.
I'm getting something.
I sense that you and Geoff have a previous relationship.
Yes, we were married.
He's my ex-husband.
She was married.
I just heard "were" and "ex".
I left him two years ago and I moved on.
He never did.
I'm also sensing that he is jealous enough to have followed you into the city and murder the man he suspected you were seeing.
I think I know where we're going next.
Where's Geoff's hut?
Oh, hi.
What do you want?
You got any problem with us searching your hovel?
No, not at all.
Please.
Why would I?
Well then, step aside, Gandhi!
Oh, vision of darkness!
Shed some light on the dark shed!
Check the shed.
Keep your eyes on him.
Oh, boy Can I get anything for you?
No, not you.
No.
Stay there.
That's Cooper.
Please, this is a horrible misunderstanding.
You little tree humpers are all the same, aren't you?
You profess to be saving the world, but deep down, you're all just a bunch of freedom-hating murderers.
Gah!
I like freedom!
Eli!
Get your feet off the seat!
So, Geoff killed Cooper just because he thought he was seeing his ex-wife?
Well, the heart can make you believe some pretty crazy things.
Isn't that right, Gus?
Brother Shawn, for the last time, my support for this community has nothing to do with Nicole.
Who's that, Cooper's wife?
No, Cooper was single.
I'm sensing this woman used to live here.
Her name is Cynthia Cooper.
We were the first women to join this community about 15 years ago.
We were like sisters.
What happened?
Six years back, she woke up and decided she had enough.
I guess she missed her family and her luxuries of the old life.
Why are we still talking to these stinky flag burners?
We've already got the bad guy.
Carlton, really?
What do you mean, the old life?
She was a promising ob-gyn.
I was a hedge fund manager.
A pretty big one.
I used to be a trust fund kid.
Where is Cynthia now?
I've been searching for her myself.
But, last I heard, she was living in a trailer park and had become mentally unstable.
All right, I'm getting something here.
But I'm gonna need you guys to make some phone calls.
You're so very close to me, it's Excellent.
Your empathy transports should be well tonified.
Now, for our next exercise, you're going to need a partner.
Who'd like to be mine?
Me!
Me, I wanna be your partner!
Please!
All right.
But first, I'd like to try a little exercise of my own.
It's called raise your hand if you're a swindling crook pretending to be a spiritual leader.
What are you talking about?
Let me ask you all a question.
Who here, other than Milosh, wasn't making a ton of dough before joining this community?
Gus?
You actually joined this freak show?
No, but I ain't mad at the idea of it.
Of course everyone here was wealthy.
Why do you think they came to me?
Wealth creates unhappiness.
Did they really just come to you, Eli?
Really?
Upon arrival, you all signed this piece of paper, correct?
Well, yeah.
It's a pledge of simplicity.
Right.
It's a carefully worded document that gives Eli here power of attorney.
Which means he now owns everything that used to belong to you.
Don't listen to him.
He's a slave to his own cynicism.
I'm a slave to love, Jack.
And fashion.
And movies where dogs cover their eyes when couples get intimate around them.
Nicole, that man you went to meet that day?
His name was Dan Cooper.
He was a cop, and he was murdered by Eli, not your ex-husband.
Cooper was the one guy that knew what Eli was up to.
His sister, Cynthia Cooper, used to live here for years.
It's true.
She was here before all your time.
But then she left, and she discovered she was ruined and was never the same.
And that is when Cooper decided to start building a case against the man responsible.
He's right.
We confirmed it with his boss.
That's why Cooper reached out to you, Nicole, pretending to be a lost soul.
You mean, all he wanted was information about the commune?
That's correct.
Though, if he'd actually met you, I suspect he would've have wanted much, much more.
Eli did his homework.
He knew that Cooper was on to him, so he tracked him down and killed him in cold blood.
The one thing he wasn't expecting was you, Nicole, witnessing the whole thing.
That was a hell of a surprise, so he had to act fast.
He thought he had you, but then he was blindsided again.
Although your esteemed leader did catch one break.
Nicole didn't get a good enough look to know it was him.
And when she returned, he knew his secret was safe.
This is total insanity.
Look at how I live.
What would I do with all this wealth you think that I'm stealing?
I don't know, flee the country perhaps?
You applied for a U.S. Passport last Tuesday.
So?
How do you know that, by the way?
You're not the only one around here who sees things, Brother.
He was planning on taking all the stuff he stole from you and fleeing to beautiful Antigua, to live in the house that he now owns courtesy of Geoff.
Eli, is this true?
Of course not, Milosh.
No!
I devoted my life to you!
Should I shoot him in the leg?
No, Dot's got mad wheels.
Eli!
Shawn?
Why am I wearing mala beads around my neck?
'Cause you're a fool.
Are you ever gonna let me forget about this?
No, I'm not.
That's gonna leave a mark.
That's for believing me.
And that's for saving my life.
I'm gonna miss you.
Miss me?
What do you mean?
I'm off to India.
What?
For how long?
Well, I kind of bought a one way ticket.
I just had the most amazing idea!
Come with me.
What would we do in India?
We'll meditate, align our chakras, get in touch with our inner light.
Oh, and you'll get to meet Rama Murthi.
He's incredible.
Who's Rama Murthi?
He's incredible.
You said that already.
The three of us will bask in golden light and liberate our inhibitions.
Um Are you crazy?
Love will abound, Gus.
My love doesn't abound like that.
But it can.
But it won't.
How about I check you when you get back?
I'll look forward to that.
This is an awfully long way to come for a piece of fruit, Shawn.
You'll soon understand, Jules.
I saw how tirelessly you worked to make sure that these people got everything back that was stolen from them.
So, what does that have to So, you get your reward.
Oh, my God.
Yes.
Hi, Shawn.
Ahh!
Dot!
Shawn!
Hey!
I just wanted to thank you for everything.
I haven't dreamed like that in years.
Okay, all right, let's You are a very lucky lady, indeed.
That's my chest.
That's How are you, Dot?
Pretty damn good.
Since I got my money back, Geoff and I are planning on buying this place.
Get out of here!
That's great.
Yeah.
Geoffrey!
I owe you one, big guy.
Yeah.
Oh, hey!
Congratulations.
Come here.
Ah, hey!
Didn't get quite enough.
Jules?
Jules?
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
No.
No.
That is unacceptable.
We had a deal.
Does that not mean anything to anybody anymore?
What, you're, "Yes," not "Yes" and you're, "No," not "No"?
I mean, if this doesn't go through, I'm screwed.
I'm screwed.
I've got a mortgage, I have a baby.
Come on.
Jeez.
Let me call you back.
Let me call you back.
You all right?
Better than you, Beamer.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now this situation is all wrong.
Oh, come on.
Trust me, I'm doing these glasses a favor.
Taking the lady to a spa weekend.
What?
That's big time, son.
He wouldn't even tell me how much it costs.
That's because it's not about money, Jules.
It's about giving you the vacation you so richly deserve.
And spending an absurd amount of money to do it.
You are growing up right in front of my eyes.
Come on, Gus, you knew this day would come.
Yeah.
Bye, Gus.
Okay.
Be sure you water my plants thrice daily but do not talk to them because once they get started they will not stop.
Especially Jim.
Jim is the "ficus"?
He is indeed.
Got it.
What?
I need to tell you something.
Read my thoughts.
I don't know how to do that.
Yes, you do.
Ready?
Fine.
Waffles.
My God, it's crazy.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
That was just a test.
Okay.
Okay, here it is.
Ready?
It's still waffles.
Damn it!
One more time.
Why are you gazing into each other's eyes?
We're not doing that.
It's just a routine forehead check reciprocated.
Listen, Shawn, I know you're nervous about this weekend, but don't worry.
You're ready for this.
Now go and have some fun, you big spender!
What?
Come on, son.
Come on.
I'm going to call you, okay?
So keep your phone on.
Oh, yeah.
Think you can survive for two days without each other?
Of course.
Look, Jules, I know that you have very definite expectations for this weekend.
What do you mean?
Well, you sent me an e-mail on the fifth saying, "Shawn, I have very definite expectations for this weekend".
Right.
To which you responded, "Slumber party.
Nudey times.
Drinky, drinky".
That's my "out of office" reply.
Look, I just think this trip is important for us.
It's our first time out of the SBPD bubble and we'll see how we really are as a couple.
Mmm.
It is an opportunity for us to take our relationship to the next step in a mature way.
I'm very excited.
Me too.
Now let's go have fun.
Don't worry about me.
I have an epic weekend planned.
It's going to be off the Hook.
Oh, hello, Guster.
I didn't know you shopped here.
I had coupons.
Yes, they do have some good bargains.
I loaded up on an armful of 40-watts.
That's a lot of light bulbs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm set.
Good Lord, you're not actually buying scented candles, are you?
How else am I supposed to freshen up my place?
Well, do what I do.
You put your laundry basket outside and blast the place with Right Guard.
Your girlfriend's going to wish she stayed in prison.
Don't you usually see her on Saturdays?
Yeah, but she got thrown into solitary for "dry gulching" a home girl on the chow line.
She sure hates "cutsies".
Shawn and I usually play "Skeeball" and make crank calls all night.
That's you who keeps calling me?
No.
What the Henry, what are you doing here?
Buy one full price, get one free.
That's what I call value.
Oh, so you're the one who took all the light bulbs, huh?
You two shop together often?
What?
Please.
Come on, man.
No.
So, you and your shirts got a big weekend planned?
If by "big weekend" you mean watching the Mannix marathon, then yes, we do.
Yeah, we got nothing to do either.
Speak for yourself, I have plans.
In fact, I'm going to a new spot tonight.
It's supposed to be slamming.
Packed to the rafters with biddies.
Ladies.
Oh.
Personally, I'm looking forward to a nice, quiet weekend at home, alone.
Yeah, solitude.
Good for the soul.
Good for you.
Packed to the rafters?
Man!
Excellent.
Now I'll just need to see a photo I.D., Mr. Guster.
Certainly.
Enjoy your stay.
I am sure we will.
Oh, and, uh, it's all you.
Shawn.
Yes.
The hotel can arrange for a hot air balloon tour.
I would love to do that.
I think it would also be romantic if we took naps in those large pool floaties that look like Shamu.
Shawn.
I know this isn't your thing, but it makes me so happy that you're here.
And look, we did it!
The two of us, on vacation.
Along with all of these other people, unfortunately.
We're going to have fun, relax, and most importantly, no work.
For two whole days, I am not a cop and you are not a psychic.
Come on.
You know I can't just turn it off like that.
Okay.
But just none of this.
I believe this is going to work out just fine, sugar-plum.
Let's go a-hunting.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Look, Gus, this is my fifth message.
I'm all out of aliases.
It's Shawn!
I need to talk to you.
Call me back "immediamente"!
Here you are, sir.
Gracias.
That just makes me feel so old.
Oh, Shawn, this is Barbie and Clive Noble.
They just arrived today as well.
Did they?
I saw Juliet's earrings and I said, "Now there is a beautiful woman with impeccable taste".
We're going to get along just fine.
Oh, my God, look at that rock.
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
We stole your chaise, Shawn.
Oh, no, no, it's fine.
We can share mine.
I did say, "Seat saved"?
Do you not remember me saying, "Seat saved"?
No, I don't.
Why are you inviting strangers into our vacation?
Because that is what adult couples do.
They make vacation friends.
Why do we need new friends?
I have Gus.
No.
You have whoever your friends are.
Shawn, you're embarrassing me.
Oh.
So, uh, Barbie, here, is from Kentucky and she met Clive in Seattle and they have been married for five years.
Wow.
That's so much information.
How long was I at the juice bar?
So, uh, what do you do, Shawn?
Professional water skier.
Who works for the city of Santa Barbara, as do I. Y'all both water ski for the city of Santa Barbara?
Oh, baby, my temples.
My temples.
Oh, sorry, honey.
Oh.
Oh.
How's that?
Oh.
Right there.
So, um, is there a lot of money in competitive aquatics, Shawn?
It's good benefits.
Decent Christmas party.
You know, we do okay.
Well, I bet.
This place is pricey.
Nothing's too good for my Barbie.
Oh, baby, what do I do to deserve you?
Besides totally deserving me.
I do.
Ooh, I love you so much, baby.
I love you.
I hate them.
Well, Shawn, the Nobles and I were talking about grabbing dinner together.
Great.
You should all enjoy yourselves.
All of us.
Together.
Uh, no thanks.
We'd love to.
Yeah.
Sounds good.
Excellent.
All right.
All right, let's get those sticky buns in my bath.
Oh.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
What are you doing?
See ya.
What's your damage, Spencer?
What is my damage?
I'm gone five minutes and all of a sudden we're swingers?
What is this, The Ice Storm?
Who are those people?
They're just people.
Oh, that's the worst kind.
We don't know them.
Something is off.
Plus, we don't know them.
And we'll have to talk to them.
It's called being an adult, Shawn.
You should try it sometime.
I'm wearing a man's robe.
What did I tell you?
"Biddies" by the bushel.
Ooh, I'm about to put in some work.
I'll tell you, if I wanted a serious and meaningful relationship, I could be doing all sorts of damage up in this "hizzy".
Am I saying that right, "hizzy"?
What are you guys saying?
Lassie, you only think you got game because you got a lady.
Oh, no, no, I got a lady because I got game.
Please.
You wouldn't be able to get any kind of play inside this room.
I can get more play than you, player.
I mean, don't get me wrong, Guster.
You have a certain sort of charm about you, but I'm a classic.
I never go out of style.
I'm like pleated pants.
Really?
Care to make this interesting?
Wait, wait, what's going on?
I can't hear squat.
We're talking about a little gentleman's wager over who can strike first with the ladies.
Great.
I want in.
I don't think so.
Hey, listen, I'm as young on the inside as these kids are on the outside.
Yeah, but when you were that young on the outside, this was all farm land.
Ha!
Hey, you want to put it to the test?
How about this?
First one to pull some digits on one of these hotties wins.
Losers bring barbeque to my house on Sunday.
Oh, it is so on.
Yeah, it is.
Safety is off!
Let's go!
Try this little slice of heaven.
Oh, oh.
It's key.
It's key.
It's key lime.
Yeah.
Well, don't they make a lovely couple, Jules?
What?
Two men can't share dessert?
And then go dancing?
Like gentlemen.
Hey, if the rhythm's right, let the music take you away, my friend.
Amen.
I was wrong.
These two are awesome.
So, how did you two meet?
Oh, my God, this is the best story.
All right, so I used to eat at this funky little sports bar where the napkins were made of, you know, real suede From DePalma Vineyards.
A light aroma of pear and citrus with a delicate hint of gouda.
Yeah, well, soon you'll be seeing my face on every box of that Jesus juice.
Have you seen the commercial for my latest line of classy boxed wines?
We got "Houston Ray red, "Houston Ray white, "Houston Ray rosé is clean out of sight"!
There's a guy who found a look and ran with it.
Yeah.
Nice watch.
Omega Speedmaster Special Edition.
Astronauts wore those on the moon.
About a hundred grand retail.
I keep my expensive watch in the hotel safe.
I'm never on time, but I feel so much more secure.
And we were married three weeks later.
What?
Yeah.
You guys got married after three weeks?
Hey, when you know, you know.
We have a very simple life philosophy.
We trust our instincts.
If we feel like it, we do it.
And then we usually have to call the fire department.
Baby, you look ravishing this evening.
Mmm.
Oh, baby.
All your facial parts are in the right spots.
Thanks, Shawn.
What do you say, tennis in the morning?
Well, now you're talking.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's say 10:00 a.m. A little breakfast first, right?
Oh, God, baby.
It's happening.
Oh, no, what's wrong?
Um, she gets migraines, horrible.
Horrible migraines.
Yeah, the room starts spinning.
Down is up, up is down.
Left is always left though.
Left is left.
Yeah.
It's odd.
You know what?
Let us pick this up, okay?
Oh, no, no, no, we couldn't.
Oh.
No, no, it's fine.
You guys can get us back tomorrow morning at breakfast.
They have got sweet rolls as big as your face.
We'll share one.
Because you know we like to share things, Clive and I. Yeah.
Yeah.
Take her out to the veranda for a drink.
You'll thank me.
Okay, come on, darling, let's go.
You ready?
Okay.
Oh, we are just party poopers.
I'm sorry.
Take it easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Feel better.
I hope she's okay.
Oh.
And now, shall we away to the veranda, m'lady?
My girlfriend's in prison.
Hello.
Mind if I freshen that up for you?
Sure, baby.
Thanks.
No prob $12.
Hey, can you call my cell phone and see if it's working?
I mean, you know, when you're done with your call.
That's cool.
I can wait.
But don't you need my number?
Hey, does anybody have a phone they can call my Phone with?
Any luck?
I'm still shopping.
I'm not going to just give it away.
I hear that.
What?
It's legit.
I don't believe it.
Who?
Hey, doll.
Her name is Chelsea.
Now for that barbeque.
I like beef ribs, but they don't like me.
Corn on the cob gets under my dental work, so creamed corn is an acceptable substitute.
And bring something green, I need the fiber.
The veranda is so romantic.
I wish somebody told me a long time ago that being an adult means hanging out with awesome people and making fun of other people.
Barbie and Clive are such a nice addition to our vacation.
I'm so glad we did this.
Me too.
I'm very fond of you.
Me too, you.
It's awfully dark in here.
Yeah.
We were robbed.
Stop saying the resort is sorry for our loss.
The resort is a building.
Unless it is Monster House or the Overlook Hotel, I am not impressed, neither is my lady friend!
As I've told you, repeatedly, we'll contact you if your items turn up.
Stop saying "if" they turn up.
Norm, please read me the list I gave you last night.
I want to make sure you have it all.
Uh, one pound cake partially eaten.
Yes.
One inflatable Shamu pool floatie.
That's correct.
One Capital One credit card belonging to a Burton Guster.
Which I have, for some bizarre reason.
Continue.
One Nintendo D.S. Why would you bring a video game on an adult's vacation?
Because it's awesome and I am in love with it and now several hours have passed and it could be anywhere in the world.
Have you contacted Interpol?
Sir, we, the staff, not the building, apologize.
Unfortunately, there were several thefts last night and we're slightly overwhelmed.
Several?
Where are the local authorities?
It's a small department with limited resources.
Feel free to take your bathrobes with you as our gift, a $200 value.
Dude, like we weren't going to take those anyway!
Um, I don't understand why you're so upset.
Because I was really connected to that D.S., Jules.
And I get emotional on vacation and now, to top it all off, we're going to be late for tennis with Barbie and Clive.
They'll understand.
We were robbed.
Let us pick this up, okay?
Oh, no.
You guys can get us back tomorrow morning at breakfast.
I've got to call them.
I've got to warn them about the lax security here.
Hold onto your pound cakes, everybody!
Free for all in here.
Shawn.
Hello.
Who is calling?
Clive's doing a bit.
It's so funny.
Jawohl, und Schnitzel, Das Boot, Bürgermeister Hasselhoffen?
We haven't found your things yet.
I need Clive Noble's room, please.
There's no one by that name registered at the resort.
The tennis is off.
All right, beef ribs and beef ribs.
And more beef ribs.
Are you kidding?
Neither of you thought to bring a vegetable?
This is a man's weekend, not a ladies' Rotary Club luncheon.
You know?
Hello?
Hi, this is Capital One Fraud alert.
There's some suspicious activity on your card in the Ojai area.
Fraud.
Ojai.
Damn it, Shawn.
So, Spencer, did you call that little señorita you met last night?
Are you kidding?
She's a couple of decades out of my comfort zone.
I just did it to prove a point that I'm still vibrant and alive and I can still reel them in.
Henry Spencer, master caster.
Hey!
Hey.
I waited all morning for you to call me but I got bored.
So I did a reverse search on the Internet and Hey!
Hey!
I'm so glad I'm in a relationship.
Whoo!
Cheers.
Yeah, this is going to be awesome.
Awesome.
Shawn, calm down.
How about you calm down, huh?
How about you calm down?
You know what the worst part is, Jules?
They just pretended to like us so that they could rob us blind.
She had you eating out of the palm of her hand with that little phony proposal story.
What about you and Clive?
You were feeding each other cake!
Okay, so I admit I was seduced by delicious flavor.
I am just a man, Jules.
Look, I forbid you to investigate.
We are on vacation.
Just let the local authorities do what they do.
Which is what exactly, Jules?
They wear Bermuda shorts!
Oh, my God.
That's my Nintendo.
Shawn.
Give me that.
Really?
I'm sorry, little man.
Enjoy your stay.
Hey, don't run!
There's no Do you read the signs?
You're acting like a child, Shawn.
I am not acting!
Well, it is about time.
Shawn, this is the fourth vacation you've paid for on my credit card.
How are my plants?
It's bad enough you used my company card to pay for your suite but now you're traipsing around doing wine tastings?
It wasn't us, okay?
Our room got robbed.
Somebody took my credit card?
Where are the charges from?
Sutton House Winery and Deep Valley Vineyards.
I can't believe this, they took a wine tour.
Who?
We know the people who stole it, okay?
And I also still need to talk to you about what is essentially a life or death situation, but since you took a year to call me back, guess what, I have to go now!
Do not hang up on Jules, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to fly off the handle like that.
You're right.
I think hotel security can handle this.
We can always buy new stuff, but you know what is irreplaceable?
A lovers' retreat.
Mmm.
What do you say we do something romantic?
Ooh, balloon tour?
God no.
How about we go wine tasting?
Yeah.
Mmm.
Mmm!
These are the best ribs I have ever eaten.
My God, I'm a mess.
Ma'am, cancel the card immediately.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Is that her second slab?
I have never seen a woman eat ribs like that in my life.
Except in cave man drawings.
Look, Chels, here's the thing.
Mmm-hmm.
I think you're an amazing girl.
Yeah, you do.
But don't you think I'm a little old for you?
No.
I like older men, especially the balding, virile type, you know?
Terry Bradshaw, Sean Connery.
Ooh, Dick Cheney.
Okey doke.
Wow.
Okay, um, Chelsea, it was a pleasure meeting you, but I need to head to Ojai and kill my best friend in the world.
Mmm.
Mmm.
And I need to help him bury the body.
Ooh, babe, can you get me another puller?
Ah!
Guys, two things.
First, what's a puller?
Second, please don't leave.
Oh, you know, as much as I hate to leave the "Uncomfortable Henry Show," I'm Guster's ride.
You kids have fun.
Oh, wow, looks like the party's over a little early, huh?
Look, why don't I pack you up some potato salad to go and, uh Ooh!
Don't be silly, muffin, we going rollerblading, yo, holler!
Who the hell goes rollerblading with seven pounds of ribs in them?
Chelsea do, that's who!
Wait!
What is wrong with you?
You're an idiot.
For over a century, my family name has been synonymous with this region.
DePalma, it's about quality and tradition.
We've never changed, and we never will.
I can't wait until my son, Gian Carlo, carries on the DePalma name with the same pride that I do.
Enjoy.
Look, I was robbed, okay?
And I'm dealing with a lot of crap right now.
Do you get that?
If you were in my shoes right now, you would Oh, hey, man, sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt your call.
Please.
If only that was the worst thing that happened to me this weekend.
Well, what do you mean by that?
Uh, let me see.
I was robbed.
Some punk couple fakes an accident on Route 33, and when I'm dumb enough to check on them because I'm a Good Samaritan, what do they do?
They rob me.
What did they look like?
Of course, like models.
They took my car keys, eyeglasses, phone, pretty much everything but my sunglasses.
I had to walk five miles.
First it was cloudy, then it was blazing hot That explains your face.
Is it obvious?
It looks like Spam.
Oh, great.
Yeah.
Check it out, man, I think we got robbed by the same couple.
What?
You see, I'm a psychic man and my senses led me to that punk couple in this very spot.
I knew you were investigating.
Shawn, this is our vacation.
I don't get to do this very often.
"Houston Ray white, "Houston Ray rosé is clean out of sight"!
Houston, we have a problem.
Vacation's over.
Excuse me.
O'Hara.
What are you guys doing here?
Well, I thought you could use some help from a detective not dressed as a cub scout.
I came to get my credit card back.
I'm having some lady troubles.
It's a long story.
Excuse me.
It's not funny.
Gus!
Boom.
A paper trail of deceit.
Look, I was a victim here, too, man.
Shawn, you robbed me.
As far as I'm concerned, you're no different than the thieves who robbed you of the thing you robbed.
Wow.
Boy that hurts, Gus.
You know why?
Because when I realized your card was gone I was sick to my stomach.
Yet, you still managed to order pay-per-view and surf-and-turf for two to the room.
Yes.
To mask the pain that was running deep.
And every bite of delicious lobster was a buttery reminder of your face.
The local cops found a spent round on the floor.
It's a.38 Special.
Now that is a classic.
Go-to munitions for cops and soldiers since WWI.
Typically used in revolvers, but no stranger to semi-autos.
I'm sensing Houston was killed with his own gun.
Any sense who might have done it?
Nice watch.
Omega Speedmaster Special.
About a hundred K retail.
Clive and Barbie.
Who the hell are Clive and Barbie?
Clive and Barbie are cold-blooded murderers who lie and make tennis dates they have no intention of keeping.
And they have my Nintendo.
All right, well, O'Hara and I will stay here and help the Barney Fife brigade comb this place for clues.
You guys all head back to the hotel.
Why the face?
Uh, well, Shawn and I were hoping to work on this one together.
Why?
Well, it's our romantic weekend away.
We'll take any alone time we can get.
Fine.
You two stay here and do whatever police work you feel enhances your sense of romance.
The rest of us will head back to the hotel, happy?
- Elated.
- I'm so glad.
All right.
All right.
So what's our next move?
Uh I have an idea.
I wouldn't do that, Clive.
Guys!
Hey.
Barbie and I were just saying that we should hang out again.
Maybe go for a hike?
Hi, Jules.
Oh, my God, I love those shoes.
Hot air balloons.
How many ways can we think of to kill ourselves?
Man, you gave Chelsea the slip in a big way.
That was cold.
I didn't give anybody the slip.
Yes, you did.
I did not.
I followed up with Chelsea, I apologized for leaving so abruptly and simply informed her that I was coming up here to spend some time with my son.
You see, my generation embraced the long-forgotten value called respect.
Let's just hope she got the text.
You never, ever tell a crazy woman where you are.
She's not crazy.
Yes, she is.
No, she's needy and I respect the difference.
That chick is bonkers!
Oh, yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
I know you, right?
I'm Gus.
So, where's Daddy?
I don't know.
I haven't seen him in a while.
Hey, Pop-Pop.
Man, there are some cuties up in here.
Look at that.
So how'd you find us?
I'm a psychic.
Right.
And I actually paid for dinner.
Seriously, how'd you find us?
We saw that the credit card was declined a half mile away and we put it together.
So, y'all are cops?
That is sexy.
Huh.
Normally civil servants can't afford the places we hit.
Okay, enough, it's confession time.
Where is my Nintendo?
Seriously?
Dude, I think we pitched that.
Oh, God.
Oh.
Now I feel bad.
Oh, baby.
You guys lied to us!
You made us believe that you really liked us as people.
And they killed someone.
Come again?
Oh, that's true also, but it's the lying.
It's the lying that's really hurtful.
Well, of all the people we've robbed, we like you guys the best.
That's true.
She went on and on about it the whole time we were riffling through your stuff, but we didn't kill anyone.
No.
Sure you didn't.
Why are you wearing a dead man's watch?
Look, we broke into his room, we took his watch and a briefcase full of legal documents but that's it.
That's right.
We are dirty thieves, but we are basically nice people and we are totally against animal cruelty.
And illegal downloading.
Piracy makes me sick.
Wait a minute That's not the gun that killed Houston Ray.
That's a fake.
It's a prop.
We stole it from a movie we were working on.
Yeah.
You guys worked on a movie?
Yeah.
As extras.
The Wild Stallion.
The Wild Stallion with Connie Sellecca?
Oh, she is a total pro.
No attitude.
She is all about the work.
You guys are horrible people but you're so cool.
Shawn, you got to believe me.
Do you really think we'd kill a guy for his watch and keep robbing highways just a few miles away?
What's the time of death on Houston Ray?
Uh, local coroner said 1:00 p.m. Why?
Okay, um, where's the last place you tried to use the card?
Uh, Target, but it was declined.
Oh, so embarrassing.
We're the real victims here.
I love you, baby.
So who killed the Texan?
Our house red is from DePalma Vineyards.
Soon you'll see my face on every box of that Jesus juice.
DePalma, it's about tradition.
We've never changed, and we never will.
We have to go wine tasting again.
You told the police you'd never seen the guy found dead here, today.
Well, lots of people visit my winery.
I mean, he's not the first person to die during a tasting, you know.
Often people are shot in the gut and dumped in a barrel.
No, that was new.
Huh.
Tell you what I think.
I think you knew the Texan.
The vineyard's struggling, he comes in here, wants to buy you out, but you would rather liquidate than turn your family business over to a wine box mogul, so when he wouldn't take no for an answer, you liquidated him.
You couldn't have been more wrong.
Damn it!
Look.
I'll break it down.
I hate the wine business.
I hate Ojai and I hate my family.
What?
Even your son Gian Carlo?
I don't have a son and if I did, I'd hate him, too.
That's just a spiel that I give in the winery during the tours.
It's all malarkey.
My name's not even DePalma.
It's Goldberg.
Gunner Goldberg.
I mean, would you buy wine from Goldberg Vineyards?
Maybe a spritzer.
That Texan was my ticket out.
He could have put a picture of his ass on the box for all I care.
That I'd buy.
Curiosity.
I was so desperate to unload, I almost accepted a lowball offer from this other schmuck.
But the guy, I mean, he's leveraged to the hilt, money from all sorts of illegal sources.
And who's that?
A real sad sack.
Listen to me, I am dealing with a lot of crap right now.
A lot of crap.
Sad sack.
Is his name Jerry?
Yeah.
All right, this is Jerry Kincaid's room.
Housekeeping!
Looks like nobody's home.
All right, guys, look, we got to keep moving.
Chelsea could be anywhere.
This room is sweet.
It has its own steam room.
You can go.
You could have just asked me to open the door, you know?
Instead of pulling your gun on me.
I'm sorry.
It was a force of habit.
Jerk.
That's fair.
Guys?
Drop the gun, Detective.
Or I swear I will shoot everybody in their stupid faces!
Worst gentlemen's weekend ever.
Thanks.
It's not like Lassiter to not answer his phone.
This is all you.
So, Jerry wanted to buy the winery but Houston swooped in and he was taking the deal away.
Jerry just doesn't seem like the killer type.
Well, as we've learned this weekend, Jules, people are not always what they seem to be.
Except on reality TV.
We are all the real housewives of somewhere.
What is it you want?
Jerry confronts Houston, the Texan laughs, all Texan-like.
So Jerry loses his schlitz.
That's a thing, right?
Pretty sure it's a malt liquor.
So clearly there was a struggle.
Jerry ends up with the Texan's gun.
Calm down!
And without thinking he shoots him.
Maybe he was thinking.
At this point, it's immaterial.
Shawn, the steam room.
Jules, come on.
We have a situation here.
It's not the time to steam it out.
Shawn, the steam room!
You are a randy little lass.
What are you guys doing in there?
Jerry trapped us.
Well, how did he do that?
Why doesn't our room have a steam room?
Jules, I got the best available room that they had.
With my credit card.
Come on, Jerry got a head start.
Let's go!
Hey!
Henry!
Henry!
Henry!
Squinty guy, sunburned, real sad sack.
Oh, yeah, I saw the guy you're talking about.
He left about 10 minutes ago in a silver Sedan.
How are we supposed to catch him now?
I'll catch him.
Carlton, there are five different ways out of here.
You'll just be guessing.
Move, move, move, move!
Maybe not!
Follow me to the activities desk!
That chick is a freak!
Get over!
Get over!
Ah!
Would you settle?
I think after this weekend, I can go without seeing you guys for a while.
Agreed.
All right, let's get this guy.
Yeah, Spencer?
Lassie, I can see you.
We're in the sky.
We commandeered a balloon from the tour desk.
Okay, let's do this.
What do you got?
Uh, I don't really know the names per se, but it looks like he's crossing over a bridge.
Cheese anyone?
What?
Not now, Felipe.
Would you get your elbow out of my face?
Oh, oh, he's passing a big red wooden building.
That's Settler's Homestead, home of the first silk factory in central California in 1887.
Crackers?
Ooh, apples.
It's Settler's Homestead.
What the hell is that?
It's the first silk factory.
It was built in 1887.
Eighteen eighty-what?
Well, how is that supposed to help me?
Move over.
You move over!
Oh, yeah, Lassie, I see you again!
You're right behind him.
His route goes the long way.
You can cut him off.
Uh, take the upper road and floor it.
Wait, I take a left?
Just turn!
Turn!
All right, a left!
Right here?
Wait!
Here we go!
Whoa!
Slice!
Slice!
Slice what?
What do you want me to slice?
No.
Not you!
Slice of cheese.
Oh, here.
Uh, the orange one.
Mmm.
Move!
Move the board!
Swap the front!
What the hell are you saying?
I'm so sorry.
My mouth is full of cheese.
It's much hotter than I was anticipating.
It's jalapeño cheddar.
Spencer, get your head in the game or I'm going to kill you.
He's coming right at you!
There he is!
- I got you now!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
No, no, no, no!
Lassiter!
Lassie!
Lassie!
Lassiter!
Lassiter!
Lassiter!
Get out of the vehicle.
And drop that weapon or I will drop you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You got it wrong.
You got it wrong.
This is all a big misunderstanding.
Come on.
Turn around.
Face your vehicle.
Get down on your knees, cross your ankles and put your hands behind your head.
What, do you think I'm a gymnast?
That's crazy.
I'm not that flexible.
What are you talking about?
Just do it.
God.
Surprisingly good work, Spencer.
We got him.
You see, Jerry was leveraged to the hilt with some pretty tough customers.
When the Texan swooped in to buy the vineyard, Jerry found himself on the hook to investors for a deal he couldn't make.
I will shoot you!
Unbelievable.
When faced with the choice Hello?
Hello?
Huh.
Oh!
Oh.
Should we head back now?
No, Felipe, I do believe we'd like to take the long way home.
Our adult vacation.
Want to see how long it takes for this grape to hit the ground?
Oh, I do.
I really do.
Oh, I hit a house!
Try the apple slices!
Yeah.
Please stop throwing things.
Sorry, Felipe.
Sorry, Felipe.
Party pooper.
Feli-poop.
Mmm-hmm.
We're really up here.
Yeah, we are.
I am going to kiss you on the mouth.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Nice vacation, huh?
It wasn't a disaster.
Got a hot air balloon ride.
Didn't count on the dead Texan in the wine barrel but my fish the first night was delicious.
I let you down, didn't I?
No, you didn't.
Oh, I did a little.
I look at Clive and Barbie and they're such a great couple.
Shawn, they're criminals.
Yeah, but they're devoted.
And we're not?
No, we are.
We are.
I just Look, Jules, I know you had these definite expectations, right?
And that in a perfect world, I'd be a little less like me, you know?
A little more mature and open to things like dancing and trips to IKEA and I can do that, you know?
And I'm not just saying that because I think I have to.
I want to.
For you.
And for us as tag team champions.
Okay.
I know that you're looking for commitment.
And the "M" word.
And some such.
Oh, you didn't think that when I said definite expectations that I meant No.
No, no, no, no, no, of course not.
That would mean I'm a complete moron.
No, I didn't think that.
Because I just wanted to make sure that we were headed down the right path.
And we are.
I mean, just coming here, this more than meets my current expectations.
I'm not ready to get married.
Are you?
Oh, God no.
No.
No.
I mean, it's on my bucket list.
But other than that, uh, hells no.
Thank you for being so much smarter than me.
Hmm?
Wow.
I hope you look that good when I'm 140.
You know I will.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm going to have to dispute the room charges.
I mean, who orders pistachio ice cream at 1:00 a. M?
We found this in one of the dumpsters out back at the resort.
I believe this is one of the items stolen from Mr. Spencer's room.
I've never seen a grown man so upset over the theft of a toy that wasn't his child's.
We take our handheld entertainment very seriously.
Well, that's your business.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
All right, Shawn.
Say a few words.
Let's wrap this up so I can get this dead thing off my kitchen table.
I'm not ready yet.
Shawn, not again.
You left the hamster in the freezer for two months while you hemmed and hawed over the appropriateness of a burial at sea.
Now just say something nice about your lizard before rigor mortis sets in, he bloats, and his arms pop off.
Okay.
Fine.
Lizardy Uh You were found in the yard on a really great day.
You came to this house as my prisoner but You left as my friend.
Shawn.
I can't deal with this right now.
Shawn.
Okay, I'll bury him myself.
You want to explain this?
Um Yes, I would like to very much.
But we are so late, Gus.
And these coffee cups are not gonna put themselves away.
You take a trip with the intention of proposing and don't tell me, your oldest and blackest friend?
I called you eight times on that trip.
I'm not letting you off on a technicality, Shawn.
Look It's my emergency ring.
That is the dumbest thing I ever heard.
What, are you kidding me?
What if the perfect proposal moment presents itself?
I gotta be ready.
I mean, what if our faces suddenly pop up on the Jumbotron or I get selected from the audience to feed Shamu at Sea World?
I gotta be ready for that.
You're actually ready to be married?
No.
Well, someday maybe.
Not anytime soon.
Look, that is It's my grandmother's ring, okay?
I can barely look at it.
Now can we please go?
We were supposed to be at the museum an hour ago.
That shipment's gonna get there before we do.
Fine.
Thank you.
I'm putting this thing away.
Just know if I ever do pop the question, I want you on one side, Jules on the other, just as a killer whale leaps over our heads to grab a mackerel.
That's storybook right there.
Shawn, this is so embarrassing.
Look, I wouldn't be stuck if it wasn't for your stupid watch.
What the hell is going on here?
Nothing!
Small, little problem.
Don't be concerned.
He thought he saw a candy bar inside.
There is a Renoir, a Degas, a Van Gogh, and an irreplaceable collection of historical artifacts in this shipment.
Why would there be a Hershey bar in the same container?
I know international shipping is quite expensive these days.
In his defense, he thought it was that cool, European candy that tastes like salt.
Ah!
Oh.
Ah!
What are you doing here anyway?
We're always here whenever a valuable shipment comes in.
To sense trouble.
And collect a check.
But mostly sense trouble.
See, I am a psychic, and we are very valuable to this museum complex.
We discovered the dinosaur over at the Natural History Museum.
Do you know who I am?
I know you're not the dude that discovered a Tyrannosaurus rex at the Natural History Museum.
That's us.
I am Christopher Holm.
Chris Holm?
Chrissy Holm?
No?
You have any nicknames?
I'm the curator of this museum.
And I did not sign off on you or you.
Well, you need to check your facts, Jack, because we are museum heroes.
So you're kind of stuck with us.
Don't check him though.
They got your name wrong on the plaque.
Oh, twice!
The first time, they called me Bruton Gaster.
And then they switched it to Brutal Hustler on the new one.
He likes it.
He doesn't want 'em to change it.
Well, I don't mind it.
You can call me Brutal.
Right.
Right.
Well, as of now, you are reassigned.
Okay.
Et tu, Brute.
Tal.
Bru-tal.
Get out of here!
Really?
We're guarding a wall?
It's probably a pretty important wall.
Man, this never would have happened if you had reached for that candy.
How is that any different?
'Cause my arms are way bigger than yours.
Please.
You know what, leave me alone.
Hey, look at that.
Get away from me.
I should probably help her.
Help her do what, run away?
I'll remind you, I've had 11 kung fu lessons.
You took four, missed six, and slept through the last one.
I was meditating!
You know what, I don't need this.
Hey!
You get your damn hands off her!
Really, you're gonna threaten them by quoting Back to the Future?
Give me the purse.
Hey!
Let go.
You okay?
Oh, my God, thank you so much.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I have a girlfriend.
What?
I know what I just did was incredibly cool, but I need to get that out of the way because I'm sensing that you were having romantic feelings.
No, actually I'm just concerned about my wallet.
Right, right.
Your wallet and then the passion, the burning passion.
Just negate those feelings, because I'm off the market.
That was pretty amazing.
I mean, who does that anymore, right?
I mean, they could have killed me, and you just took your life in your hands.
I know, I know, it's almost as if I attended all of my martial arts classes.
And then some.
Yeah, and you would never suspect that one day I might have fallen asleep and the instructor used my knees to balance the boards that they were chopping in half.
No, no.
I think what this woman is trying to say here, Gus, is that you can suck it.
No, I'm not saying that.
I'm paraphrasing.
Do you even know what "paraphrase" means?
It means, "Suck it please, Gus".
It doesn't mean "Suck it please, Gus".
Okay, well, you were both very brave.
No, no, miss, please, stay out of this.
Otherwise, he'll never learn.
Besides, he was lobbying for leaving you here to die.
Uh-oh.
Oh, my God!
Um Uh, excuse us while our lives end.
Thank you.
I guess that was a pretty important wall.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I want him jailed.
Mr. Holm, as much as that idea pleases me, you can't actually put someone in jail for being stupid.
Or for being a good Samaritan.
Or stupid!
- It does bear repeating.
- Excuse me.
We did save a woman, a fine woman at that.
You didn't mention that she was attractive.
I don't remember what she looked like.
Yes, you do.
Oh, this is preposterous.
A psychic indeed!
You are not what you claim to be.
And I hold you responsible.
I hold you all responsible!
You can no more do that then I can suppress my heroic instincts or Gus can control his bladder during intercourse.
What?
That's disgusting.
It's not true.
It's conjecture.
Look, guys, we still have a chance here.
It's only been a short time, assumingly.
And I can tell you exactly where that crate is, right down to the geographical coordinates.
This is fruitless, Shawn.
You made a guarantee based on me being able to do a reverse GPS search on an $80 hiking watch.
It needs to have the distress signal on to work.
I agree.
We need a professional at this sort of thing.
Exactly, which is why we need to forget this psychic thing for once and give the information to the cops.
Believe me, I would, but the cops don't even have the kind of firepower we need.
Dude, if you suggest Batman one more time, I will pull out your eardrums.
I'm talking about a pro, Gus.
A pro's pro.
I've already called him and downloaded him on the situation.
Really?
And who might that be?
Somebody call for an art thief?
Hello, Barton.
Can you just give us an approximate value of the collection?
Are you serious?
Could you put a value on your own father?
We just need to know what we're up against.
Let me show you what we were going to exhibit in the foyer.
These are just some of the pieces of art and the few artifacts of Harrison Yerden.
You do know who he was, don't you?
Yes.
He's the rich guy who built the airplanes.
One of the richest men in the world by the age of 32.
He spent the rest of his life trying to spend his money.
He collected art with the passion of a Renaissance prince.
He financed expeditions to the most remote corners of the Earth in search of the rarest artifacts.
I get it.
He's Howard Hughes and Indiana Jones.
The terms of his will stipulate that on the 50th anniversary of his death, which was last Thursday, his entire collection should be removed from the Louvre and brought to the Santa Barbara Museum of Art.
Where it stayed for exactly one hour until your boyfriend lost it.
We're very sorry for your loss.
We will find it.
There's always a way.
We have our best people working on it.
That's what troubles me.
You do realize I am finished, don't you?
I will be known as the man who lost the Yerden masters.
You can't do this.
You're on trial.
I'm out on bail.
In fact, you're on trial right now for doing this same exact thing.
Oh, my gosh, you did this.
Oh, please, Braxton.
This was brash, violent.
Committed by a team.
Everyone knows I work alone.
It was so inelegant.
I was in court while it happened.
Check on that.
I did, man.
There are pictures and everything.
Gentlemen, I'm here to help.
My trial ends in a few days, and my acquittal has been evident since day two.
Frankly, I was shocked they haven't called the whole thing off yet.
And besides, I owe you for breaking me out of prison.
We didn't know we were doing that.
We were patsies.
Shawn.
And I've always had a fondness for Shawn.
Why don't you show me the program you're using to locate this GPS signal?
Oh, his is much bigger.
This is going to take me a few hours.
That's perfect, 'cause I'm gonna need some time, too, if we're going after this treasure.
And this is the kind of thing that could get Gus killed.
You look ridiculous.
You're just jealous 'cause there's no black dudes in Raiders.
Wrong, Katanga.
He drove the Bantu Wind.
That was beneath you.
You're right.
Where did you get that thing?
Don't ask.
Shawn, whenever we deal with Despereaux, it always ends badly.
Your glass is always half-empty.
Whoo, serious players we have here.
Now, how do you suppose we get up onto that roof?
Really?
Despereaux, you are a genius.
I know.
It's hard being me sometimes.
Excuse me, it's my watch.
Why do you need a watch with a distress signal?
For hiking, Shawn.
You don't hike.
I plan to hike.
Players don't hike.
Man, you don't know what players do.
What do they do?
Players hike deep into the woods, they get lost, they develop hypothermia, and that's why they need GPS.
Wait a second, they're leaving all the paintings?
Why are they abandoning the expensive stuff?
We need a closer look.
Are you crazy?
Shh, shh.
Okay, I'm confused.
What was that thing?
It was a Civil War era dagger.
Only about 500 of them were made.
Really?
What's it worth?
Oh, about $9,000 maybe.
Do they know that?
Yes, they do.
Wait a minute, that's the woman we rescued behind the museum.
Good Samaritan, my ass.
We got played, Shawn.
No, you got played.
I had my suspicions all along.
That's Jacqueline Medeiros As high-end thief as they come.
And she's strictly business.
Question is, why is she doing this?
A woman like that doesn't mess with a Van Gogh.
Unless Unless she's going after the Core Collection.
Of course.
What is the Core Collection?
Nobody knows.
It's a legend really.
Story goes that Yerden kept his most secret and valuable items hidden in a Core Collection.
Went to the grave before he managed to tell anybody what or where it was.
A dagger was said to protect the collection.
I think you mean dragon.
No, I mean dagger.
Okay, let's take this information back to the police so we can be heroes again.
Hold that thought one moment.
Where's he going?
Shawn was so desperate at the museum today.
I've never seen him so down.
Yeah, he was really affected.
Hey, tell me again what it looked like when that curator was berating him.
Do you think he was holding back tears?
Because that's how I remember it.
Carlton.
Come on, O'Hara, allow me this one thing.
I don't ask for much.
I just don't want this to ruin him.
Do you seriously think that's a possibility?
Because that would be awesome.
I know Shawn, and he is not well equipped to deal with failure.
I haven't heard from him all day.
He's probably sulking on the couch.
Oh, come on, O'Hara, don't beat yourself up.
I'm sure he's out screwing something else up.
No.
No, Shawn.
You will not return messages right now.
Can I at least send a text?
No!
Look, man, I've gotten a lot of messages since we started this thing, Gus.
You're just jealous 'cause you haven't gotten any calls.
Please, I have my work phone.
The mailbox on my player phone is full.
If I had my player phone, my celly would be blowing up right now.
You don't have a player phone.
I have I have three player phones, one for each part-time shorty.
Part What are you talking about?
Man, you don't know.
No.
Yes.
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
We are leaving.
We are leaving right now.
We just got here.
Shh!
He's not answering.
He's not?
You know what, I'll just give him some downtime.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Got it.
Got it?
No, no got it.
Put back.
Put back now.
How did you even do Guys.
Hmm?
Wait a minute, I see someone out there.
We should probably go.
Go!
Go, go!
Go get them.
We're trapped.
Uh No, we are not.
It's too far to jump.
I've got this.
What?
What are you doing, Shawn?
What?
Hang on, Gus.
Oh!
Shawn, let go.
No, you let go.
Let go, Shawn.
What the hell was that?
One at a time.
Now toss me the whip.
I think I dropped it!
All right, just meet me at the speedboat at the dock, okay?
Okay, one question, which boat?
The boat I showed you on the way in.
Weren't you paying attention?
Yeah.
Well, we got a little excited, but yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's that?
That's gotta be it.
This is not a speedboat.
It's plenty speedy.
Since when do you know anything about boats?
Fine.
Fine.
Untie the rope!
Got it!
What's taking you so long?
It's a tiny rope, Shawn.
Do I look like I have children's hands?
Where's the button?
Turn the key!
Ah!
Okay, go, go, go.
We got the wrong boat.
Starboard, starboard.
Which way's starboard?
To the right, Shawn.
What are you doing?
Well, why don't you just say "right"?
Because we're seamen right now.
We are what?
Seamen.
We're seamen.
Stop saying that.
Anyone could be walking by.
That's what we are, we're seamen!
Turn it.
We're going right back to where we started, Shawn.
Well, you're putting a lot of pressure on me right now.
It's a delicate I got it.
I know I got it.
I know what to do.
This way, this way.
Starboard, starboard, that way.
It does the opposite of what I'm telling it to do.
Ooh, labradoodle.
What the hell are you doing?
Engine trouble?
Uh-oh.
We were home when we got the call.
We almost got lost finding this place.
What happened?
I'm so sorry, Shawn.
We got an I.D. It's Despereaux.
But the good news is the crate is exactly where you said it would be in the factory along with all of the other paintings.
The museum's going to be ecstatic.
Strong rally, Spencer.
Just a few hours, and the guilty party is already blown to smithereens.
Despereaux didn't do this.
Of course he didn't.
Why would I think he did?
I mean, we found him Well, parts of him the stolen goods.
I mean, it's circumstantial at best.
Carlton.
Look, the important thing is that we saved the taxpayers thousands of dollars, and I've got a new slot on my home Most Wanted wall.
Good-bye, Despereaux.
Hello, Caroline Kapicki, murderous housewife from Ojai, who's also kind of a looker, so, that's a plus.
Lassiter, please, pretend you're a person.
Right.
Spencer, I am sorry for your loss.
But Despereaux was criminal trash, so essentially that means I win.
Despereaux didn't do it, Jules.
You're looking for a dark-haired woman named Jacqueline.
Wow, that's so specific.
I'll look into it.
Mr. Despereaux's belongings will therefore be distributed in the following manner.
I'm sorry, you're here for a will reading?
Shouldn't this be at your office or in a room full of family and friends?
Sadly, Mr. Despereaux did not have the benefit of close family and friends.
Mr. Spencer, if I may speak candidly, you were really his only friend.
He left you the bulk of his possessions.
No, no, no, thank you.
Those are instruments of crime and probably all stolen.
I'll take this though.
You can't have it.
What are you, my boss?
I'm your conscience.
Tony Cox is my conscience!
What?
There's the matter of Mr. Despereaux's cash accounts, all of which were willed to Psych.
He was an amazing man.
I keep this then.
That's packing material.
You have your value system, and I have mine.
Yes!
Most importantly, there's the matter of the eulogy.
This would seem to indicate to me that you, Mr. Spencer, are the one most suited for it.
Of course, of course.
Now when do we get our money?
Well, most of Mr. Despereaux's accounts were frozen when the trial began.
Can't do it, Gus.
You can get your money any way you want it, Shawn.
Except for nickels.
I will not allow that again.
I can't do the eulogy.
Do not insult the man.
Of course you can.
Of course he can.
It's too real.
It's too soon.
Can we delay the funeral?
Are you serious?
It's a matter of the smell.
Too stinky, Shawn.
Get to writing.
No!
I'm not gonna get up in front of 10,000 people and face the reality of the Grim Reaper.
which arena we book.
You were the only friend he had, Shawn.
Male.
Male friend.
Excuse me.
He had plenty of female relationships, but Oh.
It would be a small ceremony.
Okay, well, I will be there, front row.
I will start the wave if need be.
Well, that figures.
This may be something that you can just dance in the face of, Gus, but not me.
Not me!
I will not stand up there and talk about the tragedy of Pierre's life.
Tragedy?
He was about to be acquitted, you fool.
For the first time in his life, he wasn't gonna be on the run.
Pardon me, but Mr. Despereaux was not about to be acquitted.
You shut your drunk mouth.
He told me as much.
We were losing that trial.
I was trying to make a plea, but the state was reluctant because we had no grounds.
What?
No, I'm Uh, will he be mic'd?
Wait, I need Despereaux's remains.
I can't sell them to you, Shawn.
I'm kind of on probation for that sort of thing.
I don't want to own them.
Good, because as a hobby, it is very expensive.
I just need to see 'em.
Okay.
But it's not as fun as it seems.
First thing in the morning?
Yeah, but you know It's 9:00 a.m. Somewhere.
I'm good.
You know, I'm good too.
Pierre Despereaux.
What, that's it?
That's enough.
Cause of death, diabetes.
I kid.
He exploded.
We have teeth, part of a foot, his wallet, and oddly enough a handful of Gus' things.
I don't know that it's funny.
Okay, maybe it is.
Woody, Woody, you don't understand.
This isn't Despereaux.
What?
He's still alive.
I'm pretty sure that's impossible.
His trial was going poorly.
His money was frozen, and then we offered to lead him to a crate of stolen art.
So he faked his death.
He's still alive.
And we don't have to be sad.
Shawn, I have some bad news.
I'm afraid the dental records match.
No.
Yes.
We have a partial print, Shawn.
We have everything but the DNA, and that will be in shortly.
It's him.
Trust me on this one, Woody.
There is always a way.
Shawn.
Hey!
Don't rain on it.
I've got a parade going here.
Shawn, I know what's going on.
He's gone.
Deal with it.
He's not gone!
He's too good.
You've been hiding from the pain of death ever since you were a kid.
Let it hurt.
It's gonna hurt.
The only thing that's gonna hurt is your pride when I prove that Despereaux is still very much alive.
What if he isn't?
What are you doing?
Adding another joke.
To the eulogy?
People don't like dealing with death.
Okay, Gus?
They want jokes.
They want Jeff Goldblum impressions.
They want ironic juxtaposition of Rick Springfield lyrics.
Please do not say any of this, Shawn.
I'm not saying it.
I'm rapping it.
What is wrong with you?
Just yesterday I couldn't say the world "died" without you shivering.
Okay, first of all, don't ever say that.
Secondly, I'll let you in on a little secret.
Despereaux is alive.
That is impossible.
It's perfect.
I watched him blow up.
I don't know how he did it, Gus.
But however he did it, that's how he does it.
If we learned anything from F/X and F/X2 it's that anything can be faked and Bryan Brown cannot carry a movie.
What about Full Body Massage?
We both know why we rented that.
Shawn, I don't think you're staying in reality.
Trust me, Gus.
Why do you think he wanted me to give the eulogy?
Because he's coming.
He's not gonna be here.
He most certainly is.
You wanna know why?
Because that's what I would do.
Ha.
I am giving this speech to him.
Don't you think your take on this is a little easy?
Easy?
Yes, but life is easy, Gus.
If you really want it to be.
Despereaux is here.
He's in our hearts.
Maybe in these plants and maybe behind that tree over there.
Wherever he is, I just want him to know that we can all feel his presence, listening to everything we're saying.
Ah, it's like my dad here always says, "Please, help me with my pants, for I can no longer control my bowels".
I don't say that.
Come on up here.
I don't wanna.
Come on, bring me my envelope.
It's gonna clear up all kinds of mysteries.
Give it up, ladies.
And that dude in the third row.
How'd he get the invite?
I didn't know there were gonna be any My dad!
My dad.
He's almost always wrong.
He cried at Benji the Hunted.
It's because he was being hunted.
He's afraid of raccoons.
Because they're terrifying and wear little masks.
They are.
The Golden Globe goes to Angelina Jolie For The Tourist.
Just kidding.
We all know she didn't win.
She should've.
Nope.
She was robbed.
This can't This can't be right.
He's dead.
He's Uh I've never I've never lost anyone close to me before in my entire life.
Um Jesus, how stupid sad is this?
People die.
It's awful.
And unfair.
And, oh, my God, Gus is gonna die.
I'm not gonna die, Shawn.
You are.
Soon.
Definitely before me if statistics prove correct.
Which is so wrong, because I'm practically asking for it.
People are gonna miss me so much.
My dad said this would happen.
I guess I was wrong, and I should say that now because God knows your minutes are severely limited.
Sorry to hear about your friend.
You must have been shocked.
Yeah, yeah, and so unnecessary.
Oh, victim of foul play.
Gee, I wonder who could have done it.
I don't know.
But I bet she kinda liked the look on his face as he blew up.
No one crosses me.
I believe you have something of mine.
Did I borrow your socks?
We scoured the bottom of the lake and the wreckage, and it was nowhere to be found, which means it can only be in one place.
David Lee Roth's beach house.
Give me the dagger.
I don't have it.
Really?
It looks a little something like this.
Do you need a closer look?
What is this, you show me yours, I show you mine?
Maybe.
Hey, Shawn, you out here?
Oh, Shawn, there you are.
Talk to you later.
What's going on?
Oh, crap.
Seriously, Spencer, worst eulogy ever.
It was hilarious and pathetic at the same time for all the wrong reasons.
Who was that?
Jacqueline Medeiros.
The woman who broke into the museum?
Yes.
And she lies.
Arrest her.
You have proof of this?
We gotta go.
What the hell happened?
And why does she think we have the dagger?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe Because of this.
You had that in your pants?
I swiped it off Despereaux at the bucket before we split off.
You know what that means.
You're not going after the Core Collection, are you?
No.
We are.
We're gonna make sure Despereaux didn't die in vain.
Oh, no, we're not.
Give me that.
I'm taking it to the police.
No way.
No way.
That dastardly woman killed the coolest man on Earth over this treasure, and I will not let her get there first, Gus.
There is nothing in the world that would make me give this back.
I will slug you in the face cartilage, Shawn.
Here we go.
Back to this.
All right, you know what, do it.
I'm begging you.
I am begging you to give me your best shot.
Really?
Yeah.
Ow!
That hurts like the dickens.
Well.
I will strike you back.
I dare you.
I double dog dare you.
I triple dog dare you Ah!
You went from low to high.
You were ready for that.
That's your problem, Gus.
You brought a funeral program to a knife fight.
Come on.
Come on, baby girl.
You want to bumble with the bee, huh?
Buzz.
What's this?
What is that?
What is that?
Ah!
Camel clutch.
Take that.
Ask him, ref.
Ask him.
Don't even try it.
Ah, what is happening?
I don't know!
Ah!
You bit me.
What is wrong with you?
We are going on a treasure hunt!
Oh, no, we're not.
Dude, you broke it.
You broke it.
'Cause you wouldn't let it go.
Wait a minute.
This broke off way too cleanly.
Almost like it was supposed to.
It didn't break.
That piece is a cap.
And this isn't a dagger.
It's a key.
What can you tell us about the Core Collection?
It doesn't exist.
What if it did?
But it doesn't.
Have you ever seen a key like this?
Yes.
Where did you get this?
Uh, I drew that.
Really?
Yes, it's a pressure point key.
It doesn't twist.
It disengages the lock by insertion.
Now that's a sexy idea for a key.
It's designed for a lock that you cannot see deep inside something else.
Like in a cake.
No.
More like a secret wall inside an old safe.
Do you have more of these pictures?
Uh, I'm not clothed in many of these.
The key, by the way, would be attached to some sort of post.
Or a dagger?
Hypothetically.
Hypothetically, yes.
So would you say these locks were made around, um Get there.
The Civil War?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, I would say that was 1920s.
Have you ever seen a lock like that before?
As a matter of fact, I have, yes.
At Mr. Yerden's estate.
That was built in the 1920s.
Have you ever taken the tour?
No, we have not, but we will now.
Good.
Enjoy.
Don't hurry back.
There is a lock buried in a wall somewhere around here with an opening that matches this dagger perfectly.
Will you put that away?
Oh, stop worrying.
Gonna blend.
Nobody's gonna Ah!
Ah, notice us.
No food.
I don't have any food.
I smell it.
Cheetos.
All right, fine.
It's just a snack.
And a bag of fruit punch.
But don't worry, it won't spill.
No food, drinks, smoking, flash pictures, heeled shoes, hand lotions, offensive colognes, Minnesotans, tattoos with wolves, exposed liposuction scars, lap bands, hair extensions, loud noises, surprising gestures Bodily fluids.
All right, I'll lose the Cheetos.
I've already disposed of them.
I do not repeat, so you must listen.
Contrary to popular belief, there is such a thing as a dumb question.
I'll assume many of you have completed the third grade.
If at any time you're confused by something that you hear, right, there's a book in the gift shop to help you.
It's called the dictionary.
Open it up once in a while.
Now who's ready to have a great time?
Try and keep your lower lip from dropping to your waist during the parts with multiple syllables.
Mr. Yerden spent the bulk of his life acquiring the rare works of art and priceless artifacts that you see, but do not touch, here.
Mr. Yerden also dabbled in painting himself, but we were never fortunate enough to see his works as he kept them to himself.
Do you need flash cards?
Let's go.
Damn it.
The granite in each handle on the estate comes from a quarry on the same site as one of Mr. Yerden's greatest discoveries.
Even his crypt, right here on the grounds, is made of the material.
Uh, uh Oh, what are, uh Pillows?
You know, I have a question as well.
What is wrong with you?
I mean, what I meant to say was What made Mr. Yerden choose these particular pillows?
You know, if you wanna ask an unanswerable question, ask yourself why you chose to wear that shirt.
Now Is the dum-dum show over so we can get to big folks talk?
Really?
Can we get outta here?
I'm exhausted.
You stabbed everything in this man's house.
I don't get it, Gus.
Maybe the key fits somewhere else.
Maybe the key fits nothing.
Maybe it was all an invention.
If I've learned nothing from this tour, it's that Yerden was an egomaniac.
I'll bet he's laughing in his granite-coated crypt right now.
What?
Gus.
This is it.
What, the switch to the water fountain?
No, no, no, I heard something.
The ground rumbled.
This is it.
Hey.
Banned for life.
Did they really have to fingerprint us for that?
Cheetos.
I know what that key opened.
Wow.
That sly old bastard.
Dude, there's a centipede on your shirt.
Gus.
This is it.
We just gotta figure out how to open it.
This is a trap, Shawn.
You push the wrong thing, and a giant rock comes spinning through here or spikes come out of the ceiling, and the next thing I know, I'm the skeleton locked in a perpetual scream that's meant to scare some dude My skeleton is not gonna be a punch line, Shawn.
I've worked with professionals, mercenaries, compromised double agents, and yet no one's behavior has been as utterly confusing as yours.
Thank you.
It's not a compliment.
Well, that depends on your definition of "confusing," doesn't it?
I've spent my entire life searching for the impossible, and yet somehow you've been one step ahead of me at all times.
Jackie, I told you, I'm spoken for.
Ha.
Though I do have a skill set that reaches well beyond the normal.
Great.
Then you can open that.
Mmm See, there's six and, uh Don't do it, Shawn.
I don't think he has much of a choice.
She just got so serious.
Levers.
Why did it have to be levers?
Open it.
"Look behind you".
Don't you just hate people who kill you?
I mean, really, the amount of satisfaction this woman got from what legitimately amounts to murder is mind-boggling.
Oh, sure, we were stealing the key to priceless artifacts from her, but you don't have to enjoy it is all I'm saying.
I am so happy that you are alive.
Oh, thank you.
Wait a minute.
You son of a bitch.
How could you do that to me?
Oh, never mind, you're so frickin' awesome.
How did you do it?
How did I get in here?
Well, you opened the way, Shawn.
Nice call with the fountain, by the way.
I'd have guessed the stone lions in the library, but then again, I'm a traditionalist.
No, you silly bottom.
How are you alive?
I had a perfectly good medical school body on ice.
And I'd already come up with an exit plan when you called with a much better idea.
Hello.
Hello, Shawn.
Well, nothing too important.
I'm actually in the middle of cutting my hair.
I located your watch signal instantly.
I just needed more time to set things up.
This will take a few hours.
I changed a planned fishing accident into a boat escape.
I just needed to lose you along the way.
So this whole thing was a setup from the moment we reached the factory?
Mmm-hmm.
Ooh, how did you get the DNA to match?
Now that was the problem.
I needed irrefutable proof that I was dead.
And it would be impossible to leave a large enough sample without losing a hand or a body part.
And I'd seen 127 Hours, and, well Ugh.
So I simply did the next best thing.
I changed my DNA in the database to John Doe number 12.
Of course it was gonna match.
It's him.
You can hack too.
I have a guy.
Can you introduce him to us?
Of course.
Guys.
But then again, I didn't expect you to swipe the dagger from me in the factory.
That was a class lift.
I've nothing left to teach you.
Where is it?
Let's open it together.
Oh.
It's a genie.
It's not a genie.
Gus, don't be ridiculous.
Genies come in lamps.
You do it.
His ashes?
All this way for that?
It can't be.
It's his legacy.
Even his crypt right here on the grounds is made of the same material.
If his ashes are in the urn, what's in the crypt?
The student has become the master.
Let's go.
You're doing a bang-up job desecrating this guy's final resting place.
Gus, his ashes were in the urn.
They were a clue.
In the end, he wanted us to do this.
You're not You're not crying, are you?
Well I'm sorry, it's just This guy's never gonna see his dog Tartoof again.
His dog's name was Tartoof?
Probably.
Well, you've come a long way, Shawn.
What you said at my funeral made me mist up as well.
It was wonderful.
Really moving.
You were there?
Of course, I was in the coffin.
Oh!
I was gonna check there.
- That would've been weird.
- Guys.
Can we do this?
It's gotta be Rembrandt's unfinished portrait of Alexander the Great.
It was rumored Yerden had it for years.
Or perhaps it's a Thomas Kinkade.
Shawn, you really need to learn another painter.
Yeah, like that's ever gonna be necessary.
It's breathtaking.
It's crappy.
You're crappy.
Don't know what you want.
He's going for fruit.
It looks like fruit.
This doesn't make sense.
I mean, he created this hunt, left all these clues, leaked the rumor of this collection, and all for this?
Mr. Yerden also dabbled in painting himself, but we were never fortunate enough to see his works as he kept them to himself.
They're his.
What?
Oh.
Harrison Yerden painted those himself.
These are his most cherished possessions.
Uh, I beg to differ.
Think about it, fellas.
This man traveled to the ends of the Earth, risking everything to find beautiful things made by others.
But the one unattainable goal that he would never achieve was to be the object of one of those searches.
To have someone go on a quest like ours for his works.
To be the prize at the end of a journey.
Perfect.
It's narcissistic.
In the biggest way.
I like the one with the cat.
Still crappy.
Gus is crappy.
Your mama's crappy.
You're just plain crapola.
Suck it, Shawn.
You know what, let's get out of here before we all get arrested.
I'm never gonna see you again, am I?
If you'd like to plan a vacation to some friendly, non-extraditing country, I'd be happy to set up a weekend for you.
It hurts.
It's real.
I get that now.
We're not gonna get that 1.6 million, are we?
When the courts release it, it will go into your account for about nine minutes, and then it will mysteriously disappear.
Don't try to stop it.
We won't accept it.
Oh, yes, we will.
What about the taxes?
You don't have to pay taxes on money you don't have.
Where do you get your information from, Shawn?
Gus, don't be Lao Che.
Who?
The dude from Temple of Doom.
What?
Remember, they got on his plane in Shanghai and flew all the way to India before the pilots jumped out when clearly they could have just not taken off in the first place.
What does that have to do with anything?
What?
Hey, team.
I just wanted to apologize for the scene that I caused at the funeral.
I know I've probably seemed a little crazy these last few days.
Come on, Spencer, don't beat yourself up.
I mean, thanks to you another criminal is dead.
In my book, you can hold your head up high around here.
You even found the five paintings of the Core Collection in Yerden's crypt.
This is true.
Wait, what?
The wild goose chase that rich nutbag sent us on.
We found all five paintings.
There were six paintings.
Six?
Are you telling me someone stole one of those heaps?
No.
That wouldn't make any sense.
Hello, Rembrandt.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
- Great.
- Good?
Uh, Shawn, what's going on here?
Gus, buddy.
You remember when I spent all that dough on the weekend retreat with Jules?
It was my dough.
Of course I remember.
Okay.
All right.
Why are you doing that with your eyes?
I am trying to clear your mind of the money that I owe you.
Shawn.
Look, dude, we don't have a case.
No case, no money.
So I'm just trying to raise a little cash to pay you back.
I've already made After the fliers go up, this place is gonna be like Gang Busters.
When are the fliers going up?
Seven to ten business days.
The indoor yard sale is today, Shawn.
Do the math.
You do the math.
You're the numbers guy, I'm in sales.
Hey, Thurman.
What's happening, kid?
Is this a joke?
No, it's not a joke.
If you don't like it, buy something else.
Listen, Shawn, if you really want to raise some cash, why don't you just sell the engagement ring you didn't give to Juliet?
You crazy?
How dare you!
What?
That is my Grandma Gamma's ring.
It is a prized Spencer family heirloom.
Which you stashed in a Nintendo DS and almost lost forever.
Which will never happen again because now it's in the most secure place ever.
Where?
A safety deposit box?
Even better.
A ThunderCat.
What?
Speaking of which, where is that thing?
That will be $7.
Whoa!
That is not for sale!
Sorry.
Sorry, Thurman.
You just have to hand that over.
He did pay full price for it, Shawn.
Well, I'm going to buy it back, Jules.
The price just went up, Kingfisher.
Kingfisher?
Thurman, I will give you $15 and not a penny more.
Try again.
$25.
Give me the Just This is $57.
It's all I have.
Sucker.
Suck Hey, Carlton.
Okay, I'm at the Psych office.
I'll be there in, like, 10 minutes.
Well, I think they're going to follow me no matter what.
Okay, goodbye.
Suicide over in the Thompson District.
Foul play?
Jules, I need foul play.
I need money.
I need someone to buy Robert the doll for 17 bucks.
Did you see what that kid did to me?
So?
Nothing suspicious.
I'm going to have to go rogue and fabricate something to get us in on this.
How does that differ from usual?
I'm completely sober.
You're an idiot.
I could eat.
Me too.
All right, everybody, listen up!
Deceased name is Mark Waraftig.
Age, 35.
Kept a tidy living space.
I respect that.
His body was found by the building manager, a Mr. Lloyd Marr.
I'm here.
Oh, right.
Uh, we will We will call you if we need anything.
Don't have a cell phone.
All right, well, we have the building number and, uh, you live here.
Well, Jules, my vision has told me that the hanging dude hung himself.
So, should I just invoice you or is there a cash machine nearby?
Hmm.
That doesn't really strike me as a billable observation, Shawn.
Damn it.
Hmm.
Well, Shawn and I will find the kitchen, then we'll figure out what our hourly rate is for coming up with nothing.
Hey, Lloyd, say, um, two bedroom, two bath, approximately what?
Sixteen hundred square feet?
Sixteen fifty.
Original oak floors.
Some lovely period details.
I wonder if it's still knob and tube.
Solid plumbing.
- Hey, Spencer!
- Yo!
What's the appliance situation like in the kitchen?
Twelve can dispenser in the fridge.
Super dope.
But his snacks are disgusting.
Way too healthy.
Please tell me you are not shopping for real estate right now.
In exactly 93 days and 94 nights, Marlowe will settle up her debt to society and I think that it is high time that I step up to the plate and bought a home for myself and the woman I love.
Besides, anything more than a cot and a hot plate is going to look like Versailles to her.
What?
I can tell just by glancing they're not my size.
Oh, my God.
Lloyd, my man, I'm going to need Mark's next of kin information.
That'd be his sister June.
Excellent.
I would love to get a price on her dead brother's living room set before the estate sale vultures swoop in.
Ooh.
It plush.
Still quite firm.
I don't have a case for you and I can't pull one out of my butt.
Dad, I'm telling you, I'm in dire straits here and I'm not even Mark Knopfler.
He's threatening to take out an ad in the Pennysaver, encouraging people to commit crime.
Sorry, kid.
There's nothing I can do.
Fine.
Just know that this affects you too.
Because if I don't pay Gus back the money I spent on my vacation with Juliet, he's gonna reposes my stuff and I don't have stuff, which means by default he gets your stuff.
Go ahead, touch my stuff.
Just try it.
Make my day.
Gather round, everyone!
There is some big news that you are all going to want to hear!
I have just purchased a new condo for myself and my girlfriend Marlowe who will be joining me upon completion of her prison term.
There was a competing bid on the place but I squashed that like a bug.
You are looking at the newest resident of Prospect Gardens.
The Prospect Gardens?
Yes, McNab, the Prospect Gardens.
Try and hide your jealousy.
You're embarrassing yourself.
I heard that place has bad juju.
No, you didn't.
You're right.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Now then, I will be hosting a little, uh, move in soiree this weekend.
And you are all invited.
My mother and her life partner Althea, who I have begrudgingly come to accept is the solution to her need for companionship will be co-hosting the event.
So, wear clothing that you don't mind getting paint on and back braces are recommended but not required.
Okay, get back to work, crime fighters.
It's going to be fun!
Wow, Lassie.
You bought the dead guy's condo?
You see, Spencer, this is what a real man in a committed relationship does.
He provides for his lady love.
Watch and learn and maybe, against all odds, O'Hara just might stick around.
Probably not.
You should have told him how you almost got down on one knee without telling your best friend Hey!
Can you stop bringing up old stuff.
Hiya.
Carlton, right?
Amy.
On the second floor.
Quick directions from you to me.
Exit this door, hard right, three floors down.
I know where your apartment is.
Okay.
Ooh, wow.
I love what you've done with the place.
It cozy but with a heavy dose of man.
I dig it.
Sad about Marky.
He was good people.
Can I help you?
No.
But I have something for you.
It's a potluck basket.
I like to do it for all the newbie's.
See, everybody in the building gives a little gift and then I make it look all pretty.
Here you go.
Welcome to Prospect Gardens.
Rat traps.
Oh, um, yes, they are from Lloyd, the building manager.
He's got them all over the building, just in case you get rats.
The bath salts are from me.
A little something for you and your lady.
How do you know if I have a lady?
Oh, please, as if something like that could still be on the market.
Right?
It's not, right?
Well, uh, listen, Judy.
Amy.
Maybe you can, uh, save me some time, and an altercation or two.
Mmm-hmm.
I dropped my nest egg on this place and that's years of interrogations and arrests.
Arrests?
Are you a man in blue?
I'm Head Detective with the Santa Barbara Police Department.
Ooh, get out of this condo!
Keep it down!
Art!
You take that hairy eyeball in for a trim, you gloomy Gus, you.
You people suck!
He's just a grumpy pants 'cause his wife is dead.
I need you to do something for me, Sally.
Amy.
I need you to spread the word that there is a new sheriff in town.
And I'm going to be doing background checks on everyone in this building including that duplicitous Good.
Because he's a full on little D-bag.
Hey, any chance you could get Lloyd to replace that hideous awning?
Consider it done.
I leave no stone unturned, Amy.
Yeah.
Now go spread that word.
Spread it door to door like a northwest wild fire being fed by an August wind.
You're kind of super awesome.
Thanks for noticing.
You're welcome.
And, listen, if you need anything, I am right I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know What going on?
Gus, I've learned my lesson.
Hmm.
It turns out that toys are not the safest place to hide expensive jewelry.
Yeah.
Hey, Lassie.
What, did you come by to thank us in person for your housewarming gift?
I'm here because I have a situation at my new condo.
Dead hookers.
Robot cockroaches.
I heard things.
All right.
Take a load off, Lassie.
What's What going on?
Just strange sounds and jiggling and hissing and I also, um, saw some things.
What kind of things?
Just general spooky type things.
Things that are hard to explain like, um, people that are there when they shouldn't be and should be when they aren't and, um, there were some chairs that moved on their own.
Sure.
Your place is haunted!
No.
No, it's not.
It's not haunted, you simpletons!
It's just It's nothing more than nonsense, probably.
And since nonsense is your specialty, I thought I would come here first.
We appreciate that.
What the hell is this?
Standard hiring contract.
Legal stipulation, sexual harassment guidelines.
Labor laws.
And an envelope for per diem.
That sixty bones per dude.
And a slushie fund.
That money set aside strictly for slushies.
You two morons are really enjoying this, aren't you?
Not at all.
Not really.
No.
I will pay your standard flat rate.
Not a penny more.
Take it or leave it.
We will take it.
You know the address.
Meet me at the condo at 6:00.
Don't be late.
You got it.
God, it feels good to be back.
What?
You understand why I'm upset, right?
Lassie, we have to be prepared for any and all scenarios.
Including ones that may involve spirits, shades or sprites.
Even though we know it's not any of that.
Take those off, Guster.
Okay.
Now, listen, if anyone in the building inquires about your presence, you're here for a sleepover.
Mmm.
Okay, not a sleepover.
You're here on official police business.
Agreed.
Agreed.
Let's do this.
Oh, howdy neighbor!
So, you know I was just talking to Lloyd and I was telling him that I think we need a vegetable garden on the roof and he was all, "Screw off".
And I was, "You're hilarious".
Had to be there.
Anyway, who are your friends?
Shawn Spencer.
Psychic Detective.
SBPD.
This is my partner Fellatio Del Toro.
We're investigating a haunting in Lassiter's new condo.
Wow.
That's some good skinny.
I got to get up to this floor more often, huh?
No, they're joking.
They're here on official police business.
Mmm.
Copy that, Poncherello, that's the haps.
You know, I got to say, I feel a whole lot better having a big strong man in blue on the beat.
Ooh, got to get off to work.
Nice to meet you, Shawn.
Fellatio.
Ooh.
Hello, Rose Marie.
Hello, Carlton.
I see you're still with child.
Yep.
That's sort of how it works when you're pregnant and haven't had the baby yet.
That okay with you?
I guess I don't have a choice do I?
Hey, Rose Marie, I don't suppose you've given any more thought to soundproofing the wall we share in anticipation of your offspring having colic.
I don't suppose you've given any more thought to kissing my fat, pregnant ass.
Jellybean, give me those bags!
Hey, Carlton, how are you?
Hello, Ed.
I'm fine.
Tony, come home, sweetie.
So, listen, we're doing movie night tonight and if you don't have anything else to do, why don't you come on by?
Lassie, can we?
Can we?
Can we?
Can we?
Oh, gosh, darn it, Ed, that sounds really fun but they're here on official police business.
All male sleepover.
Oh!
Fun!
Well, uh, next time then.
Say, Carlton, who you going to call?
I do not like those people.
So where'd you see those ghostly nude twins?
They weren't nude.
They were elderly.
Maybe in your imagination.
Down at the end of the hall.
It a hallway, not a nightclub!
Jerks!
That's Art.
He was in Korea.
Lloyd, my good man, I've been wanting to talk to you about something.
Let's keep those light bulbs under 60 watts, huh?
The old girl's wiring wasn't built for speed.
Hmm.
Carry on.
Uh-uh, don't you ever touch me, son.
Duly noted.
I'll talk to you soon.
Good day.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
What are you Well, hello, ladies.
Yes?
Can we help you?
You know what?
I think I have the wrong condo.
My bad.
I love your dresses though, they are very frilly.
Good day.
Good day.
That will be $1000.
Fine.
So the creepy twins live in the building.
But I haven't touched my chairs since someone or something put them on top of the table.
No.
Hmm.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is impossible.
Uh-oh.
Looks like the ghost of interior decorators past.
That will be another $1000.
You have to believe me, something strange is occurring here.
Lassie, do you have any idea how badly I wanted those twins to be a set of freakish apparitions?
More than you'll ever know.
The place looks great by the way.
Yeah.
I think this is just a case of your imagination getting the best of you.
It happens to Gus and I once every seven days.
This is not my imagination.
All right, think about it, how sure must I have been that something nefarious was at play here for me to come to you two dunderheads for help?
Hmm.
He does have a point.
It's Lassiter, he has a point.
I also think Stop it.
Stop it.
Okay, we'll stay.
But we need to be free to do what we do.
There's an intensity to our work.
Focus so pure that even the slightest distraction could cost us very dearly.
Gus, give me your face.
Wassup, girl.
Worthless idiots.
Oh!
I want to blow the bubbles.
Get it, girl, get it.
Carlton.
Carlton.
Carlton.
Marlowe.
Psst.
Did you have a bad dream, baby?
Oh, my God.
What the hell?
- Lassie!
- Lassie!
- What?
- Get in here!
Go to sleep!
- Lassie!
- Lassie!
You might want to get in here, Lassie!
Lassie!
Lassie!
What?
What?
Look!
Is that blood?
Woody, we came right down.
Why did you send us a 911 text when you were just upstairs?
No, it was a 7I11 text and I was hoping you could bring me a slurpee or a quesadilla in the shape of a tube.
Did you analyze the blood from my light fixture like I asked?
I did.
But first may I interest you in a game of shuffle board?
Ooh!
Me first.
Yes, please.
Just spit it out.
The blood wasn't human.
I'm sorry?
The blood wasn't Chupacabras?
Dead robot hookers?
Some kind of animal, one with abnormally high triglycerides and what appears to be an STD.
Did you say animal?
I can't remember what I said.
Lloyd's rat traps.
That it!
His rat traps.
Some sort of very, very large rodentia got caught in one of the rat traps and bled out into the light fixture.
It could happen.
I found a jackrabbit in my dishwasher once.
How does that explain all of the other weird stuff you've experienced?
Stress.
Exhaustion.
The presence of you two nitwits.
Oh, this is so stupid.
Just forget about the whole thing, okay?
Do not breathe a word of this to anyone.
Why would we spread this story around?
So Carlton's new condo is haunted and his ceiling is bleeding?
Yes.
It all happened when we took a late night trip to tinkle town.
Not together.
Carlton, what What happened to you?
These two happened.
You know, fellows, I, uh, didn't mention it before, because it goes without saying.
You're welcome.
You're fired.
As usual, thanks for absolutely nothing.
Rat traps!
We should have told her about Lassiter's kitchen chairs being mysteriously placed on top of the table.
Gus, I'm not telling Juliet about things that we don't believe actually happened.
Oh, my God, I believe that happened.
I was afraid you were going to say that.
This isn't a haunting, Gus.
Someone's behind it.
And if we can prove who, Lassie has to pay us for services rendered.
That might be the most pragmatic thought you've ever had.
But who is doing it?
Tonight's movie night so if you're not doing anything, why don't you come on by?
There was a competing bid on the place but I squashed that like a bug.
Lassie's neighbors.
The Farrows.
Really?
They seemed pretty normal to me.
I will spill my own blood to defend thine honor with my life.
My one, my only Charlemagne.
So warm!
So cold.
And curtain.
Thank you.
Ed is one of the more respected thespians in Santa Barbara.
Really?
Really?
I thought you had to be a woman to be one of those.
Actually not since 1964.
Now, where were we before we were interrupted by my impromptu performance?
We are aware that you have interest in the condo next door.
Expanding your space?
Well, yes, of course we were interested.
Especially with the new baby on the way.
And, yes, I had some plans drawn up.
It was going to be incredible.
One big penthouse.
Was?
We owned a lingerie store, Frisky Business.
We had to close the doors about a month ago.
So until we get back on our feet, we have to put our plans on hold.
We even withdrew our offer on 536.
And as far as anything strange going on here the past couple of days, we only got in town yesterday and last night we had to take Tony to the emergency clinic.
He was running a very, very high fever.
I can't imagine why.
One last question, is there any merchandise left over from Frisky Business?
We do have a few pieces left But they're not for sale.
Naughty.
Gus, two things.
One?
Ed's performance left much to be desired.
I can see the wheel's spinning.
And 'B', it's time we seek answers from the man who knows this building better than anyone.
Well, okay, Lloyd, but as long as we are in agreement that that awning - is a real eyesore and so - I'm changing it.
Rude.
Oh!
Hello.
You know what I was just thinking?
I should put together a camping trip.
I love to camp.
Do you love camping?
I love camping.
The whole building could go camping.
Think on this.
You liked that.
I didn't mind it.
Lloyd, my good man.
I'm Shawn Spencer.
This is my partner, Eddie Adams from Torrance.
Yeah, I remember you.
You had your hand in a dead man's fridge.
Actually, I was just looking for my watch.
May we sneak a word with you?
Come on in.
Lloyd?
He did tell us to come in.
I guess so.
Where'd he go?
Lloyd?
Really love what you've done with the place.
Clean lines.
This is disgusting.
Who lives like this?
Wow.
Lloyd.
Silly man.
Uh, we We are here to ask you kind of an odd question.
There's nothing around here that seems odd, especially if you've seen what I've heard and heard what I've seen.
So you're aware of the unexplained phenomena in unit 536?
Well, the business in 536 ain't unexplained.
That's what we were thinking.
Right.
I told you we came to the right dude.
We think someone is trying to scare Carlton Lassiter out of 536.
You're right.
And I know who the culprit is.
Oh.
Condo 536.
Mmm.
I think we're done here.
Wait, wait, I've seen it.
Sound minded men move in there then they begin to unravel and before you know it, they're delivered into the mouths of madness.
Condo 536 has a curse within its walls.
Shawn, we need to get out of here.
Thank you for your time, Lloyd.
All right, Papa Bear, previous residents of Lassie's place.
Go!
All right, first of all, there's definitely something strange going on here.
It says that a guy named Ray Brauer lived in condo 536 for about three years before one day, he decides to take a flying leap out the bedroom window.
Dead at the scene.
What?
So the last two guys who lived in Lassiter's place took their own lives?
Yeah, apparently.
Now according to this, Brauer was increasing erratic before he took the big plunge.
Now I'm no expert in this stuff but there's definitely something weird going on here.
It's not haunted.
No, it isn't.
I think it's haunted.
It probably is.
Gus.
What?
Shawn, I've been doing a little more digging into the history of Lassiter's building, gets even more weird.
I'm not sure that's even possible.
Prospect Gardens' architect was a man named J. Michael Hageman, who conceived it as his masterpiece.
It does have nice windows.
But the project had a lot of problems like structural issues, a series of contractors and eventually he saw his pet project as a colossal failure.
But not those windows, right?
It was reported that his behavior became more and more erratic and then he just disappeared.
Was he ever found?
Three days later in the building, dead, along with his wife.
Murder, suicide.
It's haunted.
It's haunted.
I'm with Gus on this one.
Would you two please stop?
All I'm saying is someone, other than me, might want to go check on Lassie to make sure the condo hasn't taken him.
All right, let's go.
Other than me.
Other than me, Shawn.
It's a coincidence, Gus.
Did you even listen to Juliet's story?
What, some hack architect has a mean wife?
It's a tale as old as time.
Buildings do not drive people crazy.
Lassie?
Lassie?
Mmm.
Mmm.
He was even worse last night?
He's totally out of his tree.
We're really hoping you'll talk to him, Chief.
He could use a bit of a shave but he looks all right to me.
Hey!
I'll go talk to him.
Woody, you got to give us something.
Lassie's off of his tree and he's only getting worse.
My brethren, the death of Marc Steven Waraftig has me vexed.
Blood screen says the man's blood contained a surprising amount of amyl nitrite.
Poppers?
Super job, Guster.
A psychoactive inhalant commonly used as a recreational drug.
Usually before a long shift.
But his snacks are disgusting.
Way too healthy.
That doesn't make any sense.
Waraftig was some sort of health nut.
Woody, can you pull up the autopsy report for a Ray Brauer?
Does the perfectly coiled human intestine fit in a 10 gallon hat?
Of course I can.
- Oh, boy.
- Meow.
Did you see that?
Yes.
No.
Wowza.
Swan dive out his bedroom window.
I always wanted to try that.
Traces of amyl nitrite in his system.
Guys, that must be it!
This psychoactive drug drove Brauer and Waraftig crazy and now someone's trying to do the same thing to Lassie.
Clearly we're looking for someone who knows the building and has access to the units.
This is exhausting.
Remind me again what I'm supposed to be looking for.
I don't know.
Anything that'll let us know why Lloyd had it in for the guys in 536.
Dude, this is the housewarming gift we got Lassie.
Remember?
ASPCA gift card?
But we made a donation in Lassiter's name on behalf of squirrels everywhere.
The question is why does Lloyd have it?
Because Lloyd is stealing from his residents.
This is Rose Marie's hat.
Based on this random collection of junk, who knows how long he's been thieving.
This guy is a serious klepto.
I think he has one of Amy's paychecks.
Gus, this is the stuff Woody was talking about, amyl nitrate.
The stuff that was found in the two dead guys from 536.
Yeah, Lloyd is literally gassing them.
Uh, go up to Lassie's place.
See if you can find any traces of this stuff.
I'm going to call Juliet and look for Lloyd.
Why do I have to go to Lassie's?
You would rather go look for Lloyd in some dark corner?
I'm going to Lassie's.
Lassie?
Lassiter?
What are you doing here, Guster?
Lassie, oh, listen, someone has been messing with your place and we know who it is.
So do I. You're not in your right mind because you've been breathing a dangerous chemical.
This stuff.
Right.
Because you put it there just now.
No, I found it.
There is no limit to how far you and Spencer will go to mess with me, is there?
Okay, Lassie, just try to pull it together And why?
Because I am moving forward in my life and I have finally scratched out a little bit of happiness and you two can't stand to see it.
Well Especially you.
At least Spencer has a girlfriend.
That's cold-blooded, Lassie.
Here's the juice, Guster.
I will prevail.
I have worked too long and too hard to get to where I am and I'm not about to let you two take this away from me.
Okay, you know what?
You're out of your damn mind.
Stay here and relax, I'm going to get you some help.
You're not going anywhere.
What is that supposed to mean?
Are you crazy?
En garde.
What?
Lassie, Lassie!
Ah!
Strike one!
Come play with us, Carlton.
Rain check.
Hey, Jules, I need you to come down to Prospect Gardens and ask Lloyd the manager a few questions.
Guster!
Guster!
The reason those guys killed themselves is because they were out of their heads!
Just like you!
Guster.
Ow!
Son of a Why doesn't that kid ever put his bike away?
You can run but you can't hide!
Guster!
That was dumb.
Guster, I'm hurt real bad, buddy.
I think I've pulled a hammie.
Actually I think I broke my ankle.
I'm not kidding about that.
It hurts quite a lot.
Guster!
This is really starting to annoy me.
Guster!
Time to come out!
Gus.
Boo!
Ah!
Guster!
Guster!
Come on!
It going to be fun!
It wasn't me!
It was Lloyd!
Lloyd is the one who is doing this!
Okay.
You win.
I guess I'm just going to leave.
You're not leaving.
You're just making footstep sounds!
Fine.
Have it your way.
This door is really solid!
I think it's oak.
I guess I just better huff and puff on this one.
Hey, Guster.
Yeah.
You know at this rate it's going to take me forever, so, uh, how about you help a brother out and unlock the door, huh?
So you can kill me?
Hell no!
Guess we have to do this the old fashioned way then.
Big money, no whammies!
What?
Stop!
Stop!
Tony!
Tony!
Help me!
Help me!
What?
Tough luck, Guster.
No, please!
Please don't!
Oh!
That's it, Lassie!
It wasn't Gus.
It was Lloyd.
It was Lloyd.
Cool.
You can let me up now.
No.
What is that rattling?
What?
It wasn't Lloyd.
All right.
If you can think of one thing in the world that would make you feel better right now, what would it be?
I wouldn't say no to a sloppy Joe.
Thank you.
Mmm.
What the hell is this, Spencer?
Oh, that, my friend, is gazpacho.
It's very refreshing.
Mmm.
All right, I'm going to get him out of here.
We're going to be back at the station if you all need us.
By the way how did you know Gus was in trouble?
We've got the shine.
I also sent him a distress text.
That helped.
I'm so sore.
Sorry I tried to kill you with my sword, Guster.
Shawn, if Lloyd isn't our killer then who else could it be?
This guy a serious klepto.
I think he has one of Amy's paychecks.
We need to get back in Lloyd's place.
What?
Why?
Are you going to explain to me what's going on, Shawn?
Yes, Gus.
Yes, I am.
And it is a doozy.
We thought that Lloyd had stolen one of Amy paychecks.
But upon further inspection, it's not a paycheck.
It's a bill.
You don't work at the hospital, do you, Amy?
We paid a little visit to a psychiatrist named Dr. Anctil.
You were his patient.
Too bad the doctor-patient confidentiality agreement is moot when you're suspected of murder.
Yeah.
He told us you have mommy issues and daddy issues.
And something called acute rejection disorder.
Probably has something to do with you being left at the altar.
Twice.
You fell madly in love with the first victim, Ray Brauer.
But the feelings just weren't mutual.
So you used the folklore of Prospect Gardens.
Stories of its haunting borne by the murder-suicide committed by the building's architect, J. Michael Hageman, many years ago.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Pipe down, Cocoa Puffs.
This breakdown is a mouthful.
You methodically made Ray think he was losing his mind by haunting and drugging him.
And eventually pushing him out of his own bedroom window.
It worked so well that you decided to do the same thing again to Mark.
Who also gave you the cold shoulder.
That's not true.
Uh-huh.
We're still not finished, Bananas Foster because there's poor, poor Lloyd.
After all these years of kleptomania, his sticky fingers finally found evidence that you were up to some nasty, nasty business.
So you killed him.
And somehow figured out a way to stuff him into the world's largest industrial dryer.
You put him on a long cycle.
Permanent press.
Which is not only cruel but also not energy efficient.
The cops are on their way, Amy.
This is the end of the line.
Sorry.
A labradoodle.
Where?
Oh!
Are you kidding me?
Come on!
Are you kidding me?
She's got the crazy coursing through her legs!
We'll never catch her.
All right, stop!
Stop!
We're wildly out of shape!
No, he's out of shape.
The air is too thin for me up here.
I can't believe you're not even breathing hard.
I know why you were haunting Lassiter.
Head detective of the SBPD.
Not going to leave any stone unturned in your building, had to turn up the heat to get rid of him.
You even rigged the light fixture to make it fill up with some kind of animal blood.
Which was super inspired in my opinion.
But also super psychotic.
Just throw in the towel.
We can get you the help that you need!
She's going up the river.
They have shrinks in the clink, Gus.
Everybody knows that.
They're good doctors!
Good prison doctors.
Just stop it.
Let it end here!
Let it end here.
Okay.
There are so many floors!
So many floors!
Give up, Amy!
There's no escape now!
Where'd she go?
You know, this is not the greatest escape strategy, Amy!
Unless you led us up here for some reason.
For what?
What?
It's not like there's an amazing view.
It's mostly trees.
Good thing Lloyd replaced that awning.
Yeah, I guess.
She crazy!
She did it!
Yeah.
Hey, dude, I remember where I hid the ring.
Gus, that was money.
I must have shined that to you.
You can't shine, Shawn, but you can use your brain.
I did.
I am.
I'm going to re-hide the ring.
This time I've narrowed it down to three super-secret spots.
I want you to pick your favorite one.
Ready?
Reptile house.
How about you put it back in the drawer at your dad's house before he notices that it's missing?
That's not really hiding it, Gus.
It's more like giving it back.
That's right.
Or are you keeping it because you're planning on proposing again?
No.
I told you.
That was never even really on the table.
Really?
Fine.
Just to show you that I'm on the level, I'll do it, all right?
I'll take the ring back to my dad's house.
Not gonna be any fun but I'll do it.
Because marriage proposal is the furthest thing from my mind.
Mr. O'Hara?
Gus, I haven't eaten in 72 hours.
I need a sandwich and a cold drink, noncarbonated.
The sandwich should have cheese but it's not a deal breaker.
I'm not a young man.
All right.
Frank, here you are.
Dressed like that.
I came as soon as I got your voice-mail.
Voicemail?
You left me an urgent message saying you were headed out for a weekend getaway with my daughter and you wanted to talk to me first.
Ooh, right.
I did not forget that I did that.
But I left you that message a week ago.
Where were you?
Tanzania.
You climbed Kilimanjaro?
Gus, don't make up words.
What were you doing in Australia, Frank?
Shawn, this is not about you and me and whether or not I conned the Igbo's into revealing the location of the Crystal Skull of Mawensi.
I sense that you had an urgent question about my daughter so spit it out.
Don't mince the words.
I gambled and went with a pickle.
Jackpot.
Okay, here the deal.
I got this crazy idea in my head that Jules wanted me to propose marriage on our vacation.
So, uh So I called you and then I stole my grandmother's engagement ring from my father's bedroom.
Wait a minute, go back.
How much was that engagement ring worth?
Ball-park.
I think Pop Pop spent like five grand on it back in 1930, why?
Mmm.
I'm glad I didn't know that.
Anyway, it was a huge misunderstanding, thank God.
But since you're here and you traveled all that way, maybe I should bank your blessing in case I need it in the very, very distant future.
Um, Shawn, I don't know, you're sharp.
But I always dreamt that my daughter would marry someone unlike me, someone honest.
Now, look me in the eye and tell me you've never lied to my daughter.
Huh?
Yeah?
Birds of a feather.
I've always had trouble with the truth.
All my life.
And it's taken its toll on the people closest to me.
Mr. O'Hara, yes, Shawn has bent the truth on occasion.
But he's as decent as they come.
In fact, he's the type of guy I'd want my daughter to bring home.
Provided he was mostly black.
And God fearing.
Yeah.
And she wasn't really my daughter.
I'll think about that.
That's very sweet.
I'll wait for your next call.
Gus, what happened to my pickle?
You ate it already.
Can't put anything over on you.
Look at the time.
I got to fly.
If the NSE calls looking for me, tell them I've dumped my cell phone.
Thanks, man.
You're welcome.
He still hasn't given me his blessing.
And he took the plate I made from Color Me Mine.
This guy!
Frank!
I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Welcome to Paths of Love.
I'm Hilton Fox.
This is the show where you get a second chance at a chance meeting.
Melinda, you're down to your last heart.
Who do you choose to protect it?
I choose Todd.
Where Where's Todd?
Oh, crap.
Where's Todd?
Cut!
Donna, where's Todd?
Oh, come on.
Jay!
Steve!
Where's Todd?
I don't understand.
What's going on?
Look, all you have to do is line the people up in a row.
You want me to fix it?
Look, watch this.
Take one white guy, put him in a suit along with the rest of the Backstreet Boys, boom!
And you fall in love.
There we go.
Show done.
Could you take care of business, please?
'Cause every second is costing me money.
I hope Todd's okay.
Todd Kramer, Caucasian, 20s, was driving at an accelerated rate, lost control of his vehicle, flipped into the ditch, and is now in a coma.
A tragic yet totally avoidable accident.
However, not a crime.
Good morning, Lassie.
May I take a look at those photos?
Come on, just a quick gander.
I'll trade you Gus' half-eaten cruller for a baby peek.
No, you won't.
Knock yourself out.
Ah!
Give him the donut.
No.
It's your half cruller, that was the deal.
You can get a brand new donut I don't care.
I don't care.
Just give him the cruller!
Do you see that?
Salad dressing.
Brake fluid, Shawn.
Huh.
Lassie, I am sensing something very non-salad-y and very non-accident-y about these photos.
How desperate are you to make something out of nothing?
Pretty desperate.
Well, yeah.
Pardon me.
My name is Steve Rollins, and I couldn't help but overhear you talking about the car accident.
And I think you're right.
I think there was foul play involved.
Really?
Why is that?
Well, the victim was a participant on a reality dating show that I'm directing.
Uh, these are only my own suspicions, mind you, but something is not right here.
And I had to come down here and tell someone.
Is there a detective I should talk to?
You are in luck.
We're detectives.
Of the psychic variety.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
This is my partner, Larenz Tate.
That would be cool, but Burton Guster is the name.
If you guys want, you could come down to the set and I could tell you everything that I know.
Yes, that sounds like We'll be there.
Shawn?
This guy Steve has worked on all six seasons of California Survivor Man.
He really knows his stuff.
Fantastic, I'll pitch him all my genius reality ideas.
No, no, Shawn.
Please don't.
All your ideas sound insane.
You must be out of your damn mind.
Punk My Mom.
The Girl With the Bear.
So You Think You Can Think You Can Dance.
Don't Touch That, It's Infected.
These are all slam dunks.
See, that's your problem right there, Shawn.
You're trying to make a mockery of reality TV.
These are the docu-dramas of our time.
Hey, fellows!
Hey, you made it.
Damn right, we did.
All right, well, come on.
Come on, come with me.
Cool.
So, what is this show, Steve?
It's called Paths of Love.
All the guys are men that the bachelorette could have had contact with.
You know, the local guy at her coffee house, a guy at the gym.
Hence the title, Paths of Love.
How does this dude know Melinda?
Todd was a model whose face is on a billboard just outside Melinda's office.
I'm telling you guys, someone is after him.
I mean, this light almost fell on him while he was in the hot tub, and a loose balcony railing almost gave way while he was leaning on it.
Sounds like what you need is a good contractor, not a detective.
That's what I thought until I saw this.
Okay.
Something's going on here.
I'm getting freaked out.
There's people watching me.
I don't trust these guys.
Look, I know when a contestant is playing to the camera.
This guy seems legitimately freaked out.
And then his car goes off a cliff.
Shawn, you're a psychic.
You must sense something is going wrong here.
Perhaps, yes, but in order to know for sure I'll need to get closer.
Full access.
I need to touch, see, feel, pitch.
Pitch?
Please don't.
Check this out.
Just go with me, okay?
Guy shows up, knocks on a door, right?
It's his big overnight date, you know?
He's showered, he feels fresh, he feels good.
He's got something going on down here.
Door opens, boom, it's A bear, yeah.
The Japanese already tried that.
Too many people died.
What?
Man, the Japanese ruin everything.
Guys, Jay gets pitched stuff 24I7.
I mean, look at There's a sample of everything that comes across his desk in a day.
"The Conjugal Midwife".
"Man Versus Pneumonia".
I need to get to the bottom of this.
Okay, but I can't have the creator of the show knowing.
He's not gonna dig having a couple of detectives snooping around, ruining his pet project.
No.
There's only one way Gus and I know how to investigate and go completely unnoticed.
We have not one, but two twists, and here they are.
Dr. Shawn Womack and Burton Guster.
Who are those guys?
Did you tell Jules about this?
No.
No, I most certainly did not.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Well, as it turns out I could have met Melinda a while back at Santa Barbara Mercy Hospital when she had her appendix removed.
I was one floor up, doing my surgical residency in Pulmonary matters.
I'm a heart surgeon, and sometimes brain.
But I am also the inventor of the hamburger candle.
Burton Guster, 35.
Pharmaceutical salesman.
I was married once.
But it was annulled.
So now I'm single and ready to see where this journey takes me.
Can I still choose Todd?
Todd is in a coma.
I know.
Can I still choose him?
Cut!
Seriously?
Cut!
Cut!
I'm gonna call cut 'cause, see, that's not supposed to happen, Rollins.
How did that happen?
Uh, Jay, these are the two new contestants.
Right.
Didn't you get my email?
The twist?
Oh, the email that says that you're gonna replace him with someone dynamic.
Okay, my lead bachelor is in a coma.
A coma This is my money on the line, not yours.
This is who you replace him with?
Hello, I'm Burton Guster.
I sell pharmaceuticals.
Oh, that's interesting.
What is going on, Steve?
I don't get it.
I really don't understand.
I birthed this show, all right?
This came from my loins, and no one's gonna screw this up!
We're not gonna screw your loins.
I mean, it No, I don't think it's gonna happen.
Okay, Jay, Jay, just trust me, okay?
Gus and Shawn are very, very colorful characters.
They're gonna make great TV.
Okay, they better make great TV.
Okay, because I sold this to NBC, right?
NBC, they make classics like Friends and uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Their next runaway smash reality show about the crabbing industry called, wait for it, you wait for it, America's Got Crabs.
That's brilliant.
I like it.
There's something there.
You and I are gonna talk about that later, okay?
Over a big baked potato.
I'm building an empire.
Everybody knows that.
And I'm taking everybody with me into the stratosphere.
Isn't that right, Hank?
Yeah, I'm getting fitted for my spacesuit later today.
Everybody knows Hank.
Everybody knows him as the best cameraman in the world.
I also know him as the man who makes me lunch, huh?
Mr. Baked Potato.
Uh, excuse me just one second, my fellow bachelors and you and also you.
Shawn, what are you doing here?
Um Gus and I are investigating Todd Kramer's car crash.
Why are you wearing a tie and a heart?
I Why are you wearing hair?
And shoes?
What are you doing here?
Turns out you were right, okay?
The guy's car was tampered with.
You happy now?
Todd's parents said he'd been at this address for the last two weeks, so we're here to talk to the owner, Jay Gianukos.
Let's go.
Uh, I don't think that's gonna be possible.
Look, I'll explain later, but for now, you don't know me and I'm very, very single, okay?
You can't run off like that, Doctor.
Now, come on.
You're needed at the pool for the single mingle.
Copy that.
Doctor?
Single mingle.
Based on Todd's testimonial, he was scared of somebody on the inside.
On the inside.
Yeah, which means probably a contestant, so let's go over there, talk to them, figure out which one of them has a motive.
Shawn, you don't get it.
They don't want to talk to you.
They're focused on Melinda.
The mingle is a make-it-or-break-it time when you can get noticed and plant seeds to get picked for a one-on-one date.
You got to have a moment.
Gus, nobody's having any moments, okay?
We're here to investigate.
This isn't a competition.
Says the guy who's gonna get voted out first.
What?
Listen, Shawn, I've been studying reality TV all my life for an opportunity just like this.
I'm in it to win it.
Yeah, well, I'm not.
Mostly because Jules would kill me.
I'm actually gonna have to try to lose.
Hello.
Hi.
Excuse me, Shawn, can I borrow you for a second?
Uh, actually I'm in the middle of a conversation with my boy.
Mmm.
Does not look good for you, homey.
That's all right.
Everybody knows that as the only brother on the show, I get a free pass through the first round.
Then she dumps you like it was the end of her semester abroad.
Look, homey, I like you.
That's why I want to help you out.
So just drop the front.
You know, the whole safe brother with the boring job and your shirt tucked into your pants.
That's so '90s, Huxtable.
If you want that chick, here's what you do.
You play the tragic card.
You tell her that your fiancée died in a skydiving accident.
I'm not lying.
Then you're not winning.
I couldn't help noticing that you have amazing hair.
Looks real, doesn't it?
It's not.
Transplant.
Mostly from my inner thighs.
A little from my lower back.
That's good.
All right, Detective, can you make this quick?
I'm trying to save my show.
Oh, mercy, of course, I'm so sorry.
Turns out your contestant Todd Kramer's car was tampered with.
You got any thoughts on that?
Yeah, yeah, I'm curious.
Can I sue him before he gets out of the coma?
He was my finale.
Now I got to deal with these guys.
It feels very real to me.
That's cheating, right?
Absolutely.
There's nothing like the wonderment on a child's face when you read to him for the first time.
Oh, that smile.
Yeah, kids bug me.
I find them disgusting.
They have sticky fingers and their voices are all high.
But seriously, which one of these dudes do you think could be a killer?
Something about this Shawn guy was intriguing.
It's as if he's trying to say all the wrong things.
Of course it makes me want him more.
I really I really love a chase.
I'm still trying to get a read on his friend, Gus.
Kind of reminds me of Bud from The Cosby Show.
Before pharmaceuticals, I used to sell office equipment.
Hmm Ooh, the pace.
Life is too short.
So I made the switch.
Now I drive an Echo.
And things are good.
Uh, my fiancée died in a skydiving accident.
Oh!
Can I borrow you?
Oh!
Absolutely.
With Brody, I think it's important that two people are attracted to each other, so physical appearance is definitely an attribute that I look for, but it's not the most important thing.
And with Brody, there's so much more than just his handsome looks.
Like I hate that guy.
Using sunscreen as an excuse to paw her.
That's my move!
If I don't get a heart necklace because of that dude, I'm unleashing the guns, Federico and Pepe.
Boom, boom!
Oh, the heart.
It's the only muscle in the body that can be broken with a harsh word and repaired with a gentle touch.
What the hell are you talking about?
Dudes like this, they never win.
Hey.
I'm sorry, guy, I've just seen a lot of these.
Yeah, we keep him around because he's good at grilling.
I think I might love her.
Or something.
If I find out that any one of you puds aren't here for the right reasons, you're dead meat.
Why are you looking at me?
I got to pee.
Did you see that?
Dude was looking right at me.
Can you say suspecto numero uno?
Suspecto Don't do it, it sounded way better in my head.
Hey, come on.
Now, remember, all of our moves are being filmed, so let's cover for each other while we snoop.
Don't worry, Shawn, the jackal is here.
What are we looking for?
Mario's stuff.
He's clearly a hothead.
Maybe Todd was getting too close to Melinda, or wasn't here for the right reasons and had to be stopped.
Counter roll, on three.
One, two Jackal down, jackal down!
Are you okay, jackal?
I'm cool.
I'm cool.
Dude, this is Brody's stuff?
All he brought was flax bars and a Speedo.
What?
The guy's here for three weeks, he didn't pack a single shirt?
Nope.
Wow.
Dude.
What would someone need a pair of greasy gloves for on a dating show?
I bet these come in handy when you need to cut somebody's brake lines.
Just as I thought.
Salad dressing.
Brake fluid.
Looks like Mario's willing to stand behind his threats.
There's only one problem with that theory, Shawn.
It's not Mario's.
Well, whose is it?
It's Danny's.
So what exactly are you guys looking for?
Photographic evidence of Danny putting the gloves inside his cubbyhole.
Nothing.
It's like it never happened.
Unless Danny can make himself invisible.
Hey, do we have any footage where it looks like just a pair of glasses walking into the room?
No.
Hmm.
Oh, excuse me.
This is a real call from actual reality.
Hey, Jules.
We followed up on the gloves, but couldn't get any definitive evidence from the footage.
I think you and Lassie should probably check it out for yourselves.
Good idea, Shawn.
We do have a few questions we'd like to ask Danny.
All right.
I gotta go.
Got a catamaran cruise in 10 minutes and I don't have proper deck shoes.
Oh, I am so, so sorry that our investigation is interfering with your dating life, Shawn.
Jules, come on.
You think I really want to be out on a boat, sipping champagne and feeding grapes to some bikini-clad philanthropist?
No, look, I'll admit, I was angry at first, and maybe even a little bit jealous, but I'm not anymore.
Look, I'll be honest.
I'm doing everything I can to fend Melinda off.
But in the end, I think my charms may prove too much for her to resist.
You kiss her, you die.
Duly noted.
You never really liked Todd Kramer, did you, Danny?
Wait, I'm sorry, Detective.
What is happening in this scene?
This isn't a scene, son.
You're in serious trouble.
But TV trouble, though, right?
I mean, it's A man is in a coma.
And we want some answers, so you better start talking.
Why was there a pair of mechanic's gloves in your stuff, Danny?
Wait, hold on.
Do you think that I had something to do with his accident?
Well, of all of the contestants on the show, you were the only one that contacted them.
Yeah, I mean, I saw the ad and I We went to the same college.
I thought maybe it'd be fun to see her again.
Oh, right, right, it does say that they took a creative writing class together.
Yeah, about that.
You were a physics major.
So what were you doing taking a creative writing class?
Hey, I'm sorry, is taking a class outside my major a crime?
No, but stalking is.
Come on.
You're obsessed with Melinda.
You can't stand the idea of another man having her.
Okay, listen.
Am I under arrest?
Not yet, but we'll be seeing you again, Danny.
Only on TV.
Dr. Womack, what are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be at the mansion?
I was and I got a call.
Oh, man, they're gonna grill you about Todd's accident, too.
They just accused me of being a creepy stalker-type.
Do you believe that?
That is ridiculous.
Everyone knows that you're the Fun guy.
The fun guy.
The grill man.
Danny the fun grill man.
'Course I'm a grill man.
Stay strong, Doctor.
Yeah, you too, Danny.
All right, peace.
Spencer, what the hell are you doing here?
Do you want to blow your cover?
I swung by early, so I can get back by 4:00 for the ice cream bar at the mansion.
Your guy is definitely lying about something, but we just couldn't nail him down.
Here's the good news.
Even though he considers me direct competition, Danny likes me.
Which means I can work him.
I can get a confession.
All that's great, Shawn.
But you don't control the show.
How are you gonna keep Danny on it?
Hmm.
Do you accept my heart and promise to protect it?
Uh, yeah, I suppose so.
Figuratively.
Literally it would be kind of weird, don't you think?
Just holding it?
Bloody and valve-y?
Yeah, I'll do it.
It's all right, man.
You tried.
Gus Look at that.
You get one, too.
Thank you.
I look forward to the opportunity to get to know you better.
So sweet.
You're welcome.
I saw it.
I knew it was coming.
I was getting my heart on.
I just gave him a heart 'cause I felt bad for him.
I mean, he lost his fiancée in a parachute accident.
Big choice.
The week after we get married, hopefully we just make a ton of kids.
Yeah.
Uh, excuse me, sorry, sorry.
I just I need to say something to the group.
What the hell's going on now?
Melinda, if I may, I know the decision is yours, who you want to give the heart to, but I think you should know there is someone here amongst us, who does not have your best interests in their heart.
Brother's gone rogue.
What do you mean?
Uh, Shawn, what are you doing?
Well, this person did not come here with a clean heart.
They have a girlfriend.
This person is Mario.
Oh!
Sweet Jesus.
Do we stop taping?
What are we doing?
No, no, no, we go in for close-ups.
Hank!
Dude, what the hell?
Blonde hair!
Dirty blonde hair.
She likes to ride hogs.
She rides pigs?
You two guys are gonna get your asses pummeled.
"You guys"?
What's with the "you guys" part?
Why is he saying, "You guys"?
Not even that attractive, really.
Mustache issues.
What's her name, Mario?
Bros before hos!
Ooh, folks, we have got a fight.
No, Mario, let's just take a look Think about it!
Don't do it.
Think about it.
Now, Melinda, despite the unorthodox events that have just happened, you still have to decide who gets your final heart.
I I I guess I choose Once you see someone have a complete mental breakdown, it's probably a sign that he's not a good match for you.
But, really it just made me think that Mario's super passionate.
But, I kinda heard my mom's voice in my head.
But he's so mad So then Danny.
Congratulations, Danny!
These guys are reality TV gold!
I know, I know!
So now that you've made a mockery of a legitimate dating process to keep this kid on the show, what's our next move?
"Legitimate dating process"?
Yes, Shawn, legitimate.
We walk over there and we make casual conversation.
We get him to reveal his motive for killing Todd.
Sounds like a plan.
But just give it a beat.
Let's let him get the patties on the grill first.
There's no reason we can't eat and investigate at the same time.
That's true, actually.
Dude, the patties aren't on the grill yet.
Easy, tiger.
Oh, my God, he's bleeding.
Oh, he sure is.
Uh Is there a doctor in the house?
We need a doctor here!
You're a doctor.
That's a good point.
I am a doctor.
But I specialize in pulmonary and sometimes brain.
Nose really isn't my forte.
Wow, seriously?
You have problems.
Yeah.
We'll use this.
All right, here we go.
See?
You're gonna be fine.
I said, I want to see Gianukos.
Step aside.
What the Uh Hey!
What are you doing here?
I want a crack at that stalker nerd.
That man's hiding something.
What the hell happened here?
Okay, listen to me.
Your stalker nerd almost got toasted a few minutes ago, okay?
He was the victim.
Everyone knows he does the grilling.
So unless he was trying to kill himself, he's not our suspect.
Now get out of here.
A very good-looking man is in a coma, and somebody caused it.
I'm putting an end to this circus now.
Listen up, 15 minute-ers, Todd Kramer's crash was not an accident.
Someone is trying to kill the contestants of this pathetic replacement for human interaction.
Side note, true love is not found on TV.
This pasty detective is right.
It's found in a women's prison facility.
Wait a minute.
Someone's trying to kill me?
Brody, just breathe, man.
Yeah, put a shirt on.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
I'm Really, I'm sorry.
I just I don't know what you guys are doing here.
Someone was almost barbecued on your grill.
Thank you very much.
I will call the gas company in the morning.
But right now, I believe two people are breaking the law.
Oh, that's right, you guys.
Trespassing.
Hank, stop shooting!
What are you doing, you idiot?
You still here?
Hey, guys.
Listen, I had a vision of Jay and Melinda.
Sordid.
It was filthy.
Jules, cover your ears.
Shawn.
He hires a beautiful girl for the show.
Then he falls in love with her.
And now he's jealous of all the guys that are competing for her affections.
Especially the ones that she actually likes, like Todd.
And me.
I don't think you fit into that category, Shawn.
Jules, that's cute.
Hey, Brody, where are you going?
I'm quitting.
Look, Melinda's a nice girl and she looks great naked.
But she's not worth dying over.
There's easier ways to get exposure.
When did he see her naked?
Hey, your back is gonna stick to the leather seats of that luxury sedan!
Poor Melinda.
Who does she possibly have to choose from now?
Hello?
I'm standing right here.
I know.
Watch your toes.
Seriously?
You're gonna put all that oil on your head?
You know that's right.
Lavender.
Melinda likes a minty shine.
Would you focus?
We need to use this day to figure out the real relationship between Melinda and Jay.
Right.
All we've got to do is get her to admit that she's secretly dating him.
Yeah, and I'll do most of the talking, since obviously she's way more into me.
Please, her heart is bleeding for me, Shawn.
My lady's chute didn't open.
She isn't even sure what your name is.
You have a girlfriend.
Shh!
Real life, not on TV.
Hello, Melinda.
Hi.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for that.
Something's weighing on you.
Wow.
You are so intuitive, Shawn.
Yeah, I guess the pressure of picking the right bachelor is just causing me a lot of stress.
Believe me, I get it.
Is it possible that there's someone else?
Someone you're involved with in the nighttime?
Shawn.
May I cut in here?
This is a taco-burrito conversation, nachos.
Excuse me, Shawn.
This is so dumb.
May I propose a toast?
Please.
To all the possibilities of things we can get into without Shawn or anybody else.
There isn't anyone else, is there?
Maybe someone rotund?
I I don't Cheers.
All right, buddy, I'm cutting in.
I just got here.
Get out of here.
Let me add to that toast with the following question, how many guys have you slept with since we started shooting this show?
Uh!
He's an idiot.
I'm cutting back in.
You can't cut in to a cut in.
You cut into my cut in, we're already mid-cut in.
I can't believe you right now.
Well, that's your problem.
Will you give us a moment please, Melinda?
Excuse me.
You're doing it all stupid.
Man, you don't know what stupid is.
You don't ask how many dudes she slept with.
It's a perfectly legitimate question when you're on a date.
No, that was not, Shawn, no, it was not.
You need to go back and read the player handbook.
You're like Ryan Gosling when he's singing with the ukulele in Blue Valentine, that's who you are.
Do not use an obscure reference on me, forget that.
Forget that.
Fine.
I'm right here, I ain't going back out there.
I ain't going back out there either.
Fine.
Fine.
Are you kidding me?
All right, let's just Let's reset for the fondue segment.
Fondue, I hear that.
What the hell is going on with you guys?
It's like you're more into each other than you are into me.
Yeah, look, that's fair, and I apologize for Gus' behavior.
My behavior?
It's juvenile and it's not very likeable.
Is it?
It's highly unlikeable.
Wow.
But answer us this.
Why have you been sleeping with Jay?
What?
I'm not sleeping with Jay.
We saw you kiss him behind the pool.
No, no.
Jay was just showing me how to "sell the romance" on camera, as he calls it.
It was just a rehearsal.
I felt really silly about the whole thing.
But I didn't actually kiss him.
Wait, were you spying on me?
Gus was.
What?
I was busy saving Danny's life.
I will punch you in the face, Shawn.
It's true.
Wait, what You saved Danny's life?
I did what anybody else would have done.
Okay, guys.
Guys, that was really good.
Really good energy.
And, uh, maybe just not so much pushing.
Sorry about that.
Got it.
Gus is prepared to pay for all the profiteroles.
You must be out of your damn mind.
No, look, guys, guys, not necessary.
Jay's got this show insured through the roof.
I mean, literally, you could break the roof and Jay would get a new roof.
Huh.
Okay, look, did I hit on Melinda?
Yes.
Guilty, huh?
Take me away.
But if you actually think that I'm killing off my own contestants one at a time so that I can have her to myself I mean, that's That's crazy.
It does sound a little crazy.
You're free to go.
Thank you.
One more question.
Yeah?
Do you have an insurance policy on the show?
Uh, yes, I do.
I'm a businessman.
And that means all of your contestants are insured as well.
I suppose they are.
Correct me if I'm wrong here.
But this is all your own money tied up in the show, right?
Yes, this is all my money tied up in the show.
Money that you will never see.
Why?
I don't understand.
Oh, well, let me see if I can make this a little clearer for you.
Sabotaging your own show is the only way you can dig yourself out of this money pit.
We're gonna need to see that insurance policy.
Wow, look at you two, Mr. And Mrs. Policeman.
I hate to burst your bubble and wipe those smiles off your faces, but I've sold the show to NBC.
So why would I sabotage that?
NBC, huh?
Yeah.
Wow, that is just super impressive.
Who's your contact over there?
Because my old neighbor, Jen's in legal affairs and maybe they know each other.
I'm Hilton Fox.
Welcome back.
Melinda, the time has come for you to choose who gets your final heart.
And who gets sent packing.
And whatever happens tonight, you're not the loser.
One of them is.
Okay.
Shawn Yes.
You are a very odd person.
One minute, you're witty and sarcastic and smart, and the next you're like a six-year-old looking for a Popsicle.
We don't have any popsicles.
I checked I see what you mean.
And Gus.
Yes?
You're an okay guy.
Well And I guess I could see us together.
But your fiancée took your heart with her when she hit the ground in that Nevada airfield, so Uh, but who's gonna help me raise my little boy, Rondell?
I can't raise him alone.
And his brother Millard, what is he gonna do?
And what about his cousin Rayjay?
That's a lot of kids you haven't mentioned.
I'm gonna choose Shawn.
Let's take a walk in the meadow.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay.
Have fun, kids.
I've watched this exact scene on TV so many times.
I never thought it would be me in the limo, driving away.
Burton Guster, you are not gonna cry in this limo.
Not today.
Oh, no, you're not.
Shawn, dancing here with you under the moonlight, it just feels right.
Oh, I got to take this.
Hold that thought, okay?
Jules!
Hey, we got Gianukos.
Yeah, it turns out he never sold a show to NBC.
Lassiter called his bluff.
He lied so that he could get a massive insurance policy on the show, and then he could kill and collect.
So thanks for the tip, Shawn.
That's how I do it when I When I do it.
So, now you can get off the show.
Ah, but Jules, I can win this thing.
Do you hear me?
Off the show, now.
Hey.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Uh, where were we?
I just I'm sorry if I'm coming on a little strong.
It's just that See, I've always had these unrealistic expectations of love.
When I was in college, in a creative writing class, I used to get these letters on my desk from a secret admirer.
They would say things like, "The heart is the only muscle in the body "that can be broken by a harsh word" And repaired with a gentle touch.
Shawn, why are you showing us this?
I just wanted to show you proof that I carried myself like a gentleman, and did the right thing.
Fire her up, Steve.
Oh, no.
I'm I'm so sorry.
I knew Jay's advice was wrong.
Men don't like women to make the first move.
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not you.
You're perfect ish.
It's me.
I have a confession to make.
I'm not a doctor.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you said you graduated from Bob Hoskins Medical School.
That's not all.
I have a girlfriend.
And things are going really well.
And we flip it around when the lights are down three, four times a week.
Sometimes five, depending on our case loads.
What?
Why would you do this to me?
Let me explain, okay?
My real job, Melinda, is psychic detective.
I was brought in here to solve a crime.
And right now, I am sensing that this beautiful, unattainable love that you so desperately seek is not only very real but much closer than you think.
Danny?
Danny is the one that wrote all of those beautiful anonymous letters to you in creative writing class.
He has always been in love with you.
And he is the only one here that truly wants to protect your heart.
That was you?
Wow!
I've been waiting a long time.
Yeah.
We're good.
Yeah.
Thank you.
And love connection.
Whoa, what was that?
Looks like some sort of glitch.
Oh, we call that a jump cut.
Just indicates a missing piece of footage.
Or time.
If someone removed footage, where would it go?
Outer space, I believe.
Correct, Steve?
No, it's not correct.
But it's almost impossible to make footage disappear permanently.
I've got it backed up on, like, a million different sources.
Hey, Steve, can you, can you bring up the footage from the day Danny almost got his face burned off?
Yeah.
Thanks.
The case of the reappearing cup.
And can you show us the raw footage from the bedroom?
The night those gloves landed in Danny's cubbyhole.
Okay.
Hank?
The camera guy?
You've got the wrong dude in custody.
Jay didn't sabotage his own show.
Where's Hank now?
He's on location filming Melinda and Danny for the proposal date finale.
Hank?
- Gus!
- What?
Let's go!
Are you serious?
Spencer, where the hell are you going?
Danny!
Shawn!
Don't take that leap!
No, Shawn, don't worry.
We talked about it.
We're ready for marriage!
Yeah!
We're in love.
Yeah!
Thanks to you, Shawn.
No, no, no, not that leap.
The chute, it's not safe!
What?
The chute!
Yeah!
No, it's the final shoot.
Shawn, Shawn, I don't know about you, but the last time I checked, I wasn't faster than a plane.
You know, buddy, in retrospect, I may have miscalculated on this one.
Put the camera down.
Are you filming me right now?
Stop filming me!
Put it down!
Get out here.
Hank, I know you were the one that had the idea for this show first.
But yours was called Passing Ships.
Am I right?
Yes.
A show about a female contestant who's reintroduced to suitors from her past who she could have met but overlooked.
How did you It's my skill set, Jack.
You thought Jay was gonna make you a partner, but instead he went out, sold this thing without you.
He was lying, but you didn't know that.
When Jay started bragging about the show, you decided you were gonna sabotage this thing at all costs to make sure it wasn't successful.
Hank, stop filming.
What are you doing, you idiot?
That's cold, Hank.
Your final plan was to switch out Danny boy's chute with Gus' dirty laundry.
That's not my laundry, Shawn.
What are you saying?
That's not my laundry.
You saying I'm holding on to some random dude's drawers?
I guess so.
You two were gonna fall to your deaths.
Like your poor fiancée.
What?
Wait a minute, whose drawers are these?
I don't I don't know.
Take them.
No.
Take these!
I don't want them, Shawn.
Take these drawers!
Take them!
Touch them!
And welcome back to the Paths of Love Reunion Show where we check in and see how our bachelors have been doing.
First things first, I will be starring in a brand-new Tyler Perry sci-fi epic called, I Ain't Gettin' On No Rocket.
Now those of you who caught the last episode, you know that Shawn had a hand in playing Cupid.
Oh, what can I say?
I love making love.
Especially on television.
I had a fantastic time on the show.
That wasn't always the case.
Let's take a look at some of your highlights from the show.
What the "F"?
Hey, guys, come on.
Who doesn't put the lid on the ice cream back?
Look at this, what is this?
You know what that is?
That's freezer burn.
We're bachelors, it doesn't mean that we're living alone.
The first thought that I had when I walked down those stairs and saw Melinda standing there, um, in that ruffly dress, was, "Not bad for a stand-in.
I wonder, uh, what the "What the actual bachelorette is gonna look like"?
I said Melinda's face Is on top of her neck Melinda's face is under her hair Shawn and Gus, now that was a really interesting relationship.
It was kind of hard to penetrate that twosome.
Initially, when they came into the house, I actually thought that they may have been together.
I mean, they're really into each other.
Like, really into each other.
You were such a cute baby.
And to think, that little bundle grew up to be a surgeon.
Did you have a feeling?
Shawn, the surgeon, yes, yes.
I Come on, it's no wonder.
He was always interested in medicine, and he I'm I'm sorry, I can't do this.
This girl is way too good for my son.
No I wouldn't vote for him.
Your call.
Wow.
Is this a joke?
Come back over here.
Have some more lemonade.
I don't want any lemonade!
Wow, well, that is a Paths of Love first.
We've now saved the best for last.
Danny.
It's highly unlikely that you would be sitting in that chair if not for the two-month medically-induced coma of this gentleman.
Bachelors, put your hands together for Todd Kramer.
Alive and well.
Hey.
Hey.
I was dreaming about you in the coma.
Oh, okay.
I got to tell you, it is rough out there in the real world.
Being single and hunting for love.
Yeah, but it's not the real world, Shawn.
It's a TV show.
Hey Okay.
You look really good.
I'm just saying it's nice, it's nice that you're in my life, you know?
That you're always standing by my side.
It feels good.
Feels right.
Jules?
What?
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hey, Deacon.
Hey, Tina.
I don't believe you've met Jimmy Brigham, he's President of ADP Security.
Oh!
Hello.
Tina.
It's an honor to finally meet the man behind those fine security guards that keep businesses safe around here.
Thank you.
Little Tina here went from high school dropout to shepherding the millions of dollars that flow through this charity.
Any chance I can hire you away to be my CFO?
Hey, hey!
You sure you need me?
Because of Deacon's hard work, crime is down 70%.
Come, I'll show you to your table.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Deacon Jones!
Tony and Drake, what's up?
The demons brothers.
How are you?
Good to see you.
It's good to see you, too.
Uh, where's Joon?
He was supposed to be here.
We changed all our schedules to accommodate him and he still blew us off.
Sucker.
Punk ass.
Buster.
I'm Burton Guster.
Tony and Drake's friend from college.
Nice to meet you.
Shawn Spencer, Tony's friend from the last time he came to town and got kidnapped.
Well, I'm really honored that you guys would choose to come perform for us tonight.
No, we're the ones that are honored.
You're in Blackappella?
We all know that every great R & B band needs a token white person.
What?
Black Eyed Peas have Fergie.
DeBarge had DeBarge and, well, there's that Hasidic rapper, Matisyahu.
He's a solo artist, Shawn.
Yeah, but it's still weird.
Don't you think, Gus?
By the way, we're not called Blackappella.
We're called Quarter Black now.
We are?
I also noticed you got it wrong in the program.
Okay, Shawn, remember we're here to honor Deacon Jones, not worry about our credits in the program or a name that still doesn't make any sense.
Makes perfect sense.
There's three of us and one of you.
If anything, we should be called Gus, you're embarrassing yourself in front of the group.
Deacon.
Yeah?
You know we'd do anything for you.
Let me tell you something.
This man right here, he saved our lives.
Yeah.
Tony and Drake told me how they were heading for the gang life as kids and how you rescued them.
These two guys are my proudest achievements.
Excuse me, Deacon, we're about to start.
Uh, this is Tina.
She handles all our finances.
Oh, hey.
Hi.
Hello.
Kudos on the Asian Lori Petty look.
Congratulations on your skinny Chaz Bono look.
Thank you very much.
Was that a compliment?
No.
I'm wearing boots because I was helping out at the Right Now Boot Camp.
There's a camp just for boots?
It's where they teach kids wilderness stuff and the value of teamwork.
It's time for your introduction, Deacon and then you three go on after that.
Four.
We're a foursome.
Okay.
Come on.
Okay, well, knock 'em dead.
All right.
Thanks a lot.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Fellows, okay, let's do our warm-up exercises.
All right.
Israel was in Egypt's land Let my people go Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh When Israel was In Egypt's land Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Oppressed so hard They could not stay Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Go down, Moses Way down in Egypt's land Tell old Pharaoh Let my people go Shawn, are you okay?
Gus, I think you're going to have to get me to a hospital.
Thank you, everybody.
We're Blackappella.
Quarter Black.
We're called Quarter Black.
All right, give it to me straight, how bad is it?
Your appendix burst.
Oh, God.
They removed it.
Am I going to die?
Yes.
Some day.
But not from this.
Still, I've lost a vital organ, one that's absolutely crucial for human survival.
Gus, I assume you're prepared to give me yours.
Uh, no.
So I can jump higher.
What?
That makes no sense, Shawn.
Besides, you don't need your appendix.
In fact, medical science is having trouble deciding if the appendix is any use to the body at all.
The doctor said all you need is a few days here to recover from surgery.
So you're telling me that my insurance won't cover the transplant.
You guys are trying to protect me from the fact that I'm going to spend the rest of my life in a gigantic plastic bubble, just like the movie I'm writing.
They've already made two bubble movies, Shawn.
Yeah, but mine's going to star Jake Gyllenhaal.
You don't need a transplant, Shawn.
But it is true your insurance will not cover your surgery, mainly because you don't have insurance.
Which means I'm footing the bill for all of this.
Thanks, Pop, and you know, I don't want to impose but I would prefer a private room with an ocean view and satellite TV with MLB Extra Innings.
Yeah, keep pushing.
I might rip your heart out.
That's an organ you do need.
Uh, that's a muscle.
Whatever.
Lassie, thanks for dropping by, bud.
As it turns out, I'm probably going to be okay.
I didn't come here to see you, Spencer.
After you left the community center there was a shooting.
What?
Who got shot?
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong Why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know That they don't have any proof Embrace the deception And learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end How's Deacon doing?
Well, luckily, the bullet went straight through and missed hitting any vital organs.
But he's lost a lot of blood.
These next two days are going to be crucial.
Thank you, Doctor.
You're my man!
You're my woman.
Come put a baby in me.
Now's not the time, Shawn.
Okay.
Any ideas on Deacon's shooter?
No.
All we know is that he went back to the greenroom after the fundraiser and a single shot was fired.
At this point, our only lead is a witness who saw a black SUV speeding away from the scene.
Are you sensing something?
Yes.
My pillows are lumpy.
Will you give them a fliff?
Because of Deacon's stature in the community, Chief wants finding his shooter to be our number one priority.
Damn right.
In the meantime, Jimmy Brigham, his security consultant, is going to stand post here, make sure he stays safe.
All right, I'll check on you later.
Don't worry.
I'll be back on my feet in no time.
Wait a minute, can I Can I walk without an appendix?
Yeah.
We should play this safe.
Dad!
Yeah?
I want a motorized Rascal with a sidecar for Gus.
Not happening.
- You guys heard the news?
- Yeah.
I just hope Deacon pulls through.
God willing.
Now we just have to find the perpetrators who did this evil deed And kill them.
What?
And bring them to justice.
Man, what's wrong with you?
Look, we want nothing more than to help bust this lowlife.
All right.
But my incapacitation means that my psychic powers are down.
Temporarily, fellows.
I'm afraid Gus and I are going to have to sit this one out.
This case is going to have to go unsolved.
I'm sorry, guys.
Shawn is right.
We have to be on the sidelines for this one.
All right, hey, that's cool.
Yeah.
We understand, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yo, why don't we go to the cafeteria and grab a bite to eat?
Yeah, you know what?
I could really use a rainbow Popsicle right about now.
Yeah.
Be safe, guys.
Later on, we're going to go to the A&W.
We need you on this case, G-whiz.
Deacon means the world to us.
You know you're helping us investigate who shot him.
I know.
You do know that Gus and those guys are going to go investigate this case without you?
Man, I know.
The time code is 4:15.
There's Deacon Jones leaving the stage and entering the greenroom.
We know he was shot in the greenroom but there aren't any cameras in there, so we don't have a lot to go on.
There are tons of potentials on the SUV fleeing the community center.
Oh, it's going to take quite some time for us to narrow down which one of these we can put at the scene.
Well, you guys keep me posted.
McNab, call your wife, tell her you won't be home for dinner.
Oh, she's actually visiting her sister in Spokane.
Every year, they knit a throw for Granny.
A throw for Granny?
I've got to know Will there be a hibiscus in this design?
There would be if this were 2004.
This guy!
Lassie, Jules, we're here to help.
Great.
Here's what I need you to do, get back into your car, make like a bat out of hell for the ocean and then drive straight into it.
Okay, O'Hara, square one.
Who would want Deacon Jones out of the way?
Well, for starters, the gang leaders whose young soldiers he's been taking off the streets.
All right, we're going to have problems identifying which gang has the biggest grudge against him.
There's three operating out of that area in the city.
Well, the gang that's lost the most kids to Deacon is the one that's been around since our day.
They're called the Rolling Ones.
The gang unit said he was recently harassed by the Rolling Ones.
Excellent work, O'Hara.
That's what I just said.
Okay, that is the group we will target first.
Who's their leader?
Her name is Lil Sis.
Lil Sis?
What happened to real nicknames like Mad Dog and El Diablo?
Lil Sis sounds like a character in Family Circus.
She's no joke.
She's doing five years for armed robbery.
Rumor is she's still calling the shots.
Yeah and good luck getting her to give up anything.
The Rolling Ones pride themselves on never talking to the police.
There might be a way to get her to talk.
Guster, it is bad enough that I'm forced to work with Spencer week after week, but I am sure as heck not going to discuss police strategy with you and the Pips.
You know Look, look, look, you need our help, okay?
We know exactly who would and wouldn't have beef with Deacon because we grew up in this community.
Plus, Lil Sis is in the same unit as your girlfriend.
If Marlowe could somehow get close to her, she might be able to get us the information we need.
And that kind of cooperation could help earn your lady an early parole.
On the other hand, maybe you and the O'Jays are on to something.
God must have invented orange just so he could see how beautiful you look in that jumpsuit.
I want to curl up in your chest hair and take a nap.
No touching!
I can't believe they're letting us meet face to face.
The warden knows you're helping us out with the case.
Oh.
What?
I'm just thinking about how lucky I am to have a boyfriend that's so committed to our relationship, working on getting me an early release.
Marlowe, I would move heaven and earth to be with you, just as long as that movement is in accordance with the state laws of California.
I've been having some trouble getting close to Lil Sis.
She and her crew really stick to themselves.
But I figured out a way that might help me to win some favor with them.
Great.
What?
It's a little unconventional.
Hey, whatever it takes.
Lay it on me.
Just remember this is for us.
Get your hands off me, screws!
No!
No!
No!
Don't worry.
We'll get them.
Hi, lover.
Is it broken?
Oh, don't worry about that, sweet pea.
It's not the first time.
Probably won't be the last.
So, how did it go with Lil Sis?
Well We had a very interesting conversation.
Oh, hey, Gus.
Hello, Marlowe.
Don't talk to them.
This is my friend, Tony.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
And Drake.
How you doing?
Damn, jail girl, you fine.
You watch your mouth, Barry White.
That's my lady.
Oh, come on, I mean, at some point he's got to run out of black artist references, right?
No.
There's a lot of them.
So, what did Lil Sis tell you?
Well Well, she did say she heard a rumor that someone within Deacon's organization was skimming money.
That's it.
That is it.
Deacon must have figured out who the embezzler was, confronted the guilty party and they tried to take him out over it.
Did I do good, baby?
Baby, you did so good I want to climb over this partition and give you the biggest kiss you've ever had Ooh!
But one or both of us would be tasered.
Yeah.
However Over here?
I'm not buying it.
I can't even look.
You know I have hang-ups about white people having prison sex.
Um, this is Burton.
Gus, where are you?
Oh, hey, Shawn, yeah, man.
I'm just, you know, here at the office catching up on some paperwork.
Block seven, door check!
Are you in a women's prison?
Uh Uh Is Lassiter talking to Marlowe?
Dude, you're investigating this case without me.
Okay, fine.
Fine.
Yes.
Tony, Drake and I are working with Lassie and Jules, but check this out, we got a break in the case.
Marlowe thinks that someone is skimming from Deacon's charity.
Tina, that Asian Lori Petty, she handles all of Deacon's money.
Tell Lassie.
Lassie, Lassie!
What?
Shawn says Tina's the one who handles the fundraising.
We should start with her.
That's a decent lead.
I'll head over to the community center, see what she knows.
Meanwhile, you, Wind and Fire, stay out of my way.
I got to go, sweet pea.
No touching!
I love your hair.
I love you.
Oh, one thing I didn't mention to Lassie because it's more fun not to tell him stuff is that Tina's been helping out lately at the Right Now Boot Camp.
Right Now Boot Camp.
Got it.
We'll head over there.
Hey, I know a back way that we can take that's even faster.
No!
You're not going without me.
If you value our friendship, Gus, you won't make another move unless I'm right there with you.
Shawn, how do you expect me to do that?
Dude, hold me higher.
I can't see anything.
I can't believe I let you talk me into this, Shawn.
Well, look at it this way, we're finally going to use this thing for something more than playing Fruit Ninja.
Stop looking at yourself.
Look into the camera, Shawn.
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.
My hair looks even thicker on HD.
There she is.
Whoa!
Why do you think she locked the door?
Maybe she's up to something she doesn't want anyone to see.
Exactly.
Watch me.
Okay.
Okay.
Looks like Tina's the one who's skimming.
She's probably the one who shot Deacon.
Fellows, I don't like how this is looking.
Us, alone in the woods, tracking a would-be killer.
This is not African American.
I was thinking the same thing.
No black guys in the movies ever make it out of these situations alive.
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Drake, LL Cool J has survived Michael Myers, great white sharks and Queen Latifah.
Wait a minute, Holiday wasn't a horror movie.
It wasn't?
No.
Oh, man, I didn't get that flick at all.
Will you two stop it?
The three of us are not going to die.
Gus is right.
Only one of you is.
And it'll probably be Drake.
I know.
Hey, I heard that.
Now what?
Three and a half against one, we take her by surprise.
Got that right.
The question is, which one of us goes in first?
Where did she go?
Please tell me that was Drake cracking a walnut and not the sound of a loaded gun.
Let's hope she does not have enough bullets in there to shoot all of us.
This gun holds 10 rounds.
Well, let's hope she shoots Gus 10 times.
What?
Tell her to shoot me.
Tell her to shoot me all 10 times!
Shoot me, bitch!
I'm holding you, Shawn, remember?
Oh, yeah.
What the hell are you doing here?
We're trying to find out who shot Deacon and right now you're our prime suspect.
What?
Tina, we know you've been skimming from Deacon's charity.
We also know Deacon found out and to keep him quiet you shot him.
You don't know anything, guy on the screen I think I met once.
Oh, really?
I know I could be relieving myself in the bed right now and you wouldn't know anything.
Ew.
I also know the only option you have is to turn yourself in to the SBPD.
Okay, you jackasses have no idea what's happening.
And anyway, I got real problems I got to deal with.
Get in the closet.
Oh, hell, no!
You ain't going to be talking to me crazy, all right?
We don't stuff ourselves into any tiny spaces, all right?
That's where I draw the line.
Yeah, that's right.
And you're going to have to shoot this man with all 10 bullets if you want us to go in some damn closet.
Are you crazy, Drake?
Please tell me that was Tony making a motorboat sound.
That is the problem I got to deal with and if he finds you, he will kill you.
So get in the closet!
Okay.
Okay.
Stabilize yourself!
I'm getting nauseous!
Where's my money?
First we need to talk.
Ain't nothing to talk about.
I want to know why Deacon was paying you off.
Tina, I need that money fast.
Why?
Are you going somewhere?
You shut up and mind your damn business!
I ain't scared of you!
You will be if you don't give me my money!
Gus, this doesn't sound good.
Call Lassie and Jules.
Damn it.
I don't have my phone.
You call them.
The nurse took my cell away.
Some bunk about the signal interfering with a lady's heart monitor.
But they let you be on the internet on FaceTime?
Apparently it's a very fine line.
That bastard is attacking Tina!
We have to save her!
We?
IPad Shawn is a lot braver than real Shawn.
No, he's right.
Tina had our back, we have to have hers.
Yeah.
On three, now!
Why is he paying you?
Why is he paying you?
Huh?
Ooh, she's whooping his ass.
Why is he paying you?
Tina!
Tina, you don't want to kill him!
Come on!
You don't want to kill him!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
No, wait!
Wait, no!
Why is he paying you?
Wait!
No, Gus, stop, no!
Stop it!
What the hell did you do that for?
It was his idea.
You're pointing at the lamp.
Yeah.
At least he didn't get the money.
So, wait, it wasn't you skimming, it was Deacon?
When did you find out what he was up to?
A few days ago.
I found some discrepancies in the books and I was going to confront Deacon after the fundraiser, but he got shot, so I dug deeper and I found out Chuy was the one he was paying off.
I arranged to meet him here, but thanks to you I still don't know what for.
Again, his fault.
Don't make me mute you, Shawn.
I just can't believe Deacon's a thief.
Why would he do such a thing?
You can ask him that yourself.
Tina told us about the money skimming, Deacon.
Look, look, look, there is no way in the world this beautiful, inspiring human being stole from his own charity.
That's right.
This man saved my life.
Go ahead, Deacon, tell them.
You're no thief.
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I always knew you were a rat.
You're going straight to hell.
Hey, I did it to save lives.
What does that mean?
The only way Chuy would let these young kids out of the gang is if I paid him to do it.
So, yes, I took money from my own charity.
And technically, that's against the law, but I did it to save these young kids.
And that's why people donated money in the first place.
I always knew you were a saint.
You're going straight to heaven.
I ain't going nowhere yet.
I'm still alive.
Trouble is that Chuy wanted more and more money and I had to cut him off.
That's why he came down to the fundraiser, to threaten me.
So we were having an argument and then I got shot and I blacked out.
Sounds like Chuy's our shooter, fellows.
Damn it!
We had him and we let him get away.
Any idea where we can find Chuy, Deacon?
Rumor has it that he has hideouts all over the south side Don't!
Stop!
No!
Stop it!
Whoa, I'm getting something.
I am sensing that Chuy is big into body art, right?
I can see one of his tattoos still in progress.
I can't be sure.
It's either a Burmese tiger or Sandra Bernhard sitting on a sparkler.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Word is that he's been operating out of this tattoo parlor on Blanco Street.
And that's right near the community center.
Bingo!
This is it, fellows.
This is it.
Now, Gus, this is usually the part of the investigation where I look at you and I say, "Yo, Gus, yo, we got to go confront the bad guys, son".
And you look back at me and you say, "No, Shawn, no, Shawn, no!
"I can't get killed confronting 'em.
"We got to call the cops, kid".
I do not talk like that, Shawn.
I don't talk like that.
I'm telling you, do not confront the bad guy.
Call Lassie and Jules.
Great idea, Shawn.
We got it.
We'll call them on the way back to the station.
All right.
Drive safe, fellows.
Later on, we'll do sit-ups in a circle.
If we take this to the cops, they'll have to launch an investigation and Deacon will get busted for misuse of funds.
There's got to be a way to bring down Chuy without Deacon getting in trouble.
We have to confront the bad guys.
I know.
What's the plan, G-whiz?
That's the tattoo parlor right there.
One of us has to sneak around the back, get a visual of Chuy.
And then we kill him.
Take a picture of him getting in the SUV that hopefully matches the one the police are looking for.
There's definitely something wrong with you.
Right.
See, with the photo, we can tie Chuy to the SUV that was last seen leaving the crime scene.
Hmm.
Right.
And then Lassie and Jules will arrest him without ever knowing that Deacon did anything illegal.
The question is which one of us sneaks back there and takes the picture?
You know what?
I'll step up.
I vote Tony.
Me?
Oh, no, I'm a terrible shooter.
You a shutterbug.
I'll go back and take the picture.
That works, too.
That works, too.
Look, you guys just stay here out of sight.
I'll be back in a second.
If he's not back in five minutes, we'll go get the BB guns.
Oh, you know that's right.
Okay.
Is 10 minutes enough?
Better be safe and make it 20.
I cannot believe this.
I cannot believe this.
I turned away for a second, one second.
And when I looked up they were being kidnapped.
Try to calm down, just tell us everything you remember.
What the car looked like, who was driving I don't know.
It was a dark-colored SUV heading that way.
And the number, the license plate number ended in 2-1-9-0.
Sounds like the same SUV from the Deacon shooting.
Well, let's get going on it.
Let's get a chopper in the air and search the area or something.
Since when are you in charge, Guster?
We're going to need a chopper to search the area.
Yes, sir.
I have no idea how this happened.
Wait, didn't the same thing happen to Tony and Drake last year?
No.
That was Tony and Joon.
Gus, what happened?
What are those police cars doing there?
I can't look at you, Shawn, I'm too ashamed.
Don't you turn your face away.
Don't you dare go Elephant Man on me.
Fine.
I got Tony and Drake kidnapped, Shawn.
What do you mean, like last time?
Pretty much.
We need to find them before they get hurt.
They're not as strong as I am.
Well, whatever Chuy's going to do, he's not going to waste his time.
Oh, this was on your car.
Expired meter.
We need to get inside Chuy's headquarters and find some clues now.
Luckily, I'm wearing my probable cause door-kicking shoes.
Good, buddy, now point me at everything you see.
Are you getting any readings, Shawn?
It's all clear.
Now, there's still a disconnect between me and the room.
I'm afraid I'm going to need a conduit.
Gus, touch Lassie's face and neck.
Wait.
Hey.
Good.
Now give his nose a gentle squeeze.
You want to mess around?
Or do you want to find your friends?
Let's go check out the front.
Okay.
Finally, now that they're gone, you can help me piece together any clues that we find.
I don't know how much help I'm going to actually be, Shawn.
My instincts have been all wrong.
It started with me taking this case while you were stuck in the hospital in the first place.
And then not going to the police.
Like I told you to.
I should have known it wouldn't end well.
Point me in a different direction.
Show me some stuff.
Ooh, hold up.
Hold up.
Let me see that article about the shootings.
Damn.
Remind me to stay away from Jefferson Boulevard.
Jefferson's Rolling One's territory.
They call it the Rolling Ones because they control all drug trafficking along Jefferson from block 100 to 190.
Ooh, say that last part again.
Blocks 100 To 190.
Gus, what were the partial license plate numbers from the SUV that took Tony and Drake?
Two, one, 90.
As in blocks 100 "to 190".
Gus, that's it.
I bet the license plate is 1-0-0-2-1-9-0.
Which stands for 100 to 190.
It's a vanity plate bragging about their gang territory.
What?
Come on, son.
Come on.
Ouch.
Gus, stop, that hurts.
We need to get Lassiter and Jules.
We find that SUV, we also find Tony and Drake and Deacon Jones' shooter, too.
I'm on it.
Looks like the DMV gave us the right address.
I know you're working with Tina!
We don't have it!
Please don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Please!
I don't want to die.
We don't know where the money is.
SBPD freeze!
Drop your weapons!
Oh, yes, thank you!
Oh, thank you!
What?
Gus, don't hide.
You have to do something.
That's easy for you to say, Shawn.
Those aren't I-bullets whizzing by.
Gus, would you be a man?
Be a man!
Nurse, I would like a little more of that Jell-O please.
Get down!
Get down!
Chuy, stop!
Gus, don't let him get away.
What do you expect me to do, Shawn?
I don't know!
Well, we did a sweep of Chuy's headquarters and residence and unfortunately none of the dozen guns we recovered at the scene matched the ballistics of the one that shot Deacon Jones.
That doesn't seem right.
He must have another weapons cache somewhere.
Well, Chuy's dead and the two gang bangers we arrested at the scene aren't talking.
Which is why we were hoping you two could help shed some light on the situation.
Yeah, sure, Detective Lassiter, whatever you need.
Can you think of anything that Chuy might have said that would connect him to Deacon's shooting?
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.
Listen to me.
If those other two dudes aren't talking, then maybe we shouldn't say anything either.
We're not suspects.
You're the victims.
Really?
Well, how do we know that you're not telling those other two dudes that they're the victims and we're the suspects?
Well, I think shooting at them with a Colt.
45 made my position pretty clear.
Drake, you're acting paranoid, all right?
Just cooperate.
Just cooperate?
How do I know this isn't that old police trick where they separate us, tell me that you're selling me up the river, just to get me to then start snitching on you.
Because we're not separated, dude.
And you didn't do anything wrong.
Right.
Right.
Yeah, I'm just checking.
You know, I got to be sure, you know.
Just FYI, I'd be willing to testify against, uh You know, in exchange for lesser charges, of course.
Lesser than what?
To answer your question, Detective, yes, we heard Chuy talking about the shooting.
Yeah.
Finally, something helpful.
Chuy knew that the cops were trying to pin Deacon's shooting on him.
We overheard him telling his boys he didn't do it, though.
Of course he'd say that.
Yeah, but that's what I thought, too.
But then he said he was going to prove his innocence.
How?
I don't know how.
I'm just glad you got there when you did because I'm telling you, these dudes were about to torture us.
Chuy was going to jump-start our nipples with a car battery.
Yeah, we're talking dark ages here, okay?
I mean the man pulled out knives, a blowtorch, pliers, bandages and Some evil looking stuff in a bottle called, uh Help me!
It was lidocaine.
Lidocaine.
Wait, wait, lidocaine?
That's a local anesthetic.
Something you would use when you're performing an outpatient surgery.
We were arguing and then I got shot.
I blacked out.
Luckily most of the bullet went straight through and missed hitting any vital organs.
Tell me why he's paying you!
Guys!
Guys!
I'm having a psychic vision.
Chuy wasn't going to use that stuff on Tony and Drake.
He was going to use them on himself.
For what?
To remove a bullet from his arm.
Why not just go to the hospital?
Because hospitals are mandated to report any gunshot wounds to the police.
Gang bangers avoid them at all costs.
Lassie, we need to get Woody to look for that bullet in Chuy's arm.
Huh.
Let's get down there.
Godspeed.
Get 'em.
Okay, Shawn, are you seeing all this?
It's just like I'm there with you, Woody, my man.
And are you seeing this?
Yeah, he can see.
So, first, the bad news.
Based on my analysis of Chuy Rodriguez's remains, he couldn't have been the person who shot Deacon Jones.
But Deacon identified Chuy as the shooter.
He may have thought Chewbacca shot him but Shawn's hunch was right.
I pulled this bullet out of Chuy's arm.
It matches a bullet fragment that was taken from Deacon Jones' shoulder.
So the bullet went straight through Deacon and hit Chuy.
And Chuy knew that bullet was evidence that would prove he didn't shoot Deacon.
Mmm.
Maybe whoever shot Deacon Jones knew that, too.
So they blew him up before the police could find him.
Which means the shooter's still out there.
Which means we're back to square one.
All right, let's go over what we know.
One, Deacon was shot in the greenroom while arguing with Chuy.
Two, the only people who had access to the backstage area were Blackappella Quarter Black.
Blackappella.
Quarter Black.
Blackappella, Deacon Jones and Jimmy Brigham, the head of security.
We need to interview Brigham again.
Whoa, whoa, hold up, hold up, hold up.
In addition to Blackappella and Brigham Tina.
Tina also had access backstage and she was still there after we left for the hospital.
I'm having a very strong psychic vision that she is hiding something from the police.
You're sure about this?
Yes, 100% sure.
All right, well, based on your hunch, we have to question Tina again.
Okay, please be careful.
I will.
Nice work.
Thanks.
What's all this about, Jimmy?
Your security man has overhead every break in the case from his post outside the door.
You know the cops are on to you.
You got to act fast.
Thank you for the brilliant idea to use FaceTime to keep yourself in touch with what your buddies were doing.
It was Gus.
He insisted.
I wasn't trying to kill you, Deacon.
I only wanted to scare you by shooting through that window.
Why?
Because you're bad for business, Deacon.
The safer you make the neighborhood for local store owners, the more clients Jimmy's security company lost.
Oh, Jimmy.
Jimmy, we're on the same team, man.
We were when I was making enough money to take care of my family.
But then the economy went bad and my biggest customers started canceling their accounts.
So you wanted to frame the gangs for taking a shot at Deacon Jones, pillar of the community.
Then everybody starts fearing the gangs again, right?
And they all run back to Jimmy to protect them, just like the good old days.
That idiot Chuy messed everything up when he pushed you into the line of fire.
Well, his ass turned into some serious collateral damage.
The only consolation is that I probably saved lives by taking his.
I only wish I didn't have to take yours as well.
But Shawn's given me no choice.
I'll give you choices, man.
Look around, you're in a hospital, Jimmy.
Think this through, you can't just be shooting dudes.
Some orderly's going to get in big trouble for accidentally giving you too much morphine.
Really?
Is it Prince Markie Dee from the Fat Boys?
Hey, Jimmy, come on.
Let's hope Spencer's hunch about Tina pays off.
Something about it isn't sitting right with me.
Didn't it seem odd to you guys that Shawn was so sure?
When do Spencer's hunches not seem odd?
We just thought he felt really strongly about this one.
No.
I know Shawn.
The stronger he feels about something, the sillier he'll act.
He'll make an obscure analogy or if anything he'll say he's 200% sure, knowing good and well that I'll correct him because that's impossible.
But this time he said he was 100% sure.
It's too simple.
Plus, he would never refer to us as Blackappella.
So, what are you saying?
You think he got it wrong?
All I know is that my gut's telling me something's off.
What?
So now we're supposed to follow your hunches, too?
No, I'm asking you to trust me.
Come on, Jimmy.
You don't have to do this, man.
Come on, think about the community and the kids and the And the cats that hang out behind the building with the baby cats and Man, Deacon, that's some deep noise.
Yeah?
You know, if you have to get murdered, which we do Yeah.
There are much worse ways to go.
Hey, Shawn, if we don't do something, man, we're going to die.
Man.
Don't you think I would have done something by now if I could, Deacon?
Yeah.
I'm on a banana sled, Jack, come aboard!
You could have had a second chance!
Ah!
Whoa, that'll do it.
Good night, sweet Jimmy.
Stay on the ground, Brigham.
I said stay on the ground.
Morphine!
The morphine!
Deacon, you got to come back down to earth, buddy.
Okay?
Hey, you okay?
Yeah.
I'm on a banana sled with you.
Feel the peel, baby.
Feel the peel.
Shawn!
Thank god you're all right.
We didn't know what Brigham was going to do to you two guys.
Thank god you got here when you did.
That's all thanks to Gus.
He had a feeling something wasn't right and he convinced us to trust him.
What?
Man, who was all down on themselves earlier and not trusting their instincts?
Thanks for saving me, bro.
Man, thanks for keeping him at bay until we got here.
Oh, you the man.
No, you the man.
Son.
Stop it!
Why did the morphine not affect you?
Uh, well, luckily my dad refused to pay for any kind of pain medication after 24 hours.
That's just glucose.
I got to admit though, man, I feel oddly euphoric.
Strangely energized.
That's the adrenaline rush from having a life or death experience.
It fades away fast.
Yeah, but you know my pain threshold, man.
I mean, no, it's pretty high.
It's up there.
It's pretty What's happening?
Here comes the pain.
Oh, I'm going down, Gus.
Don't get rigor mortis on me, Shawn.
Oh, I'm going down!
Oh, God.
Don't look at me, Jules!
You got this?
Hey, kitty.
Hey, kitty cat.
Man, I can't believe you guys have to leave already.
You sure you can't hang out for a few more days?
Sorry, Shawn, we have business to handle at home.
That's right, business.
We can't just be running around Santa Barbara chasing bad guys for weeks on end.
I know, right?
What would that look like?
What do we look like to you?
Some kind of sidekicks or something?
Uh, guys, we don't have any more cases for you.
You never give us anything.
Hey, at least we get to sing together again before you go.
How is that?
Blackappella isn't scheduled to perform again.
No, they're not.
But Quarter Black is.
We'll have a love lockdown Lockdown, baby A super max affair of the heart We'll have a love lockdown lockdown, baby A super max affair of the heart This is nice.
Thank you.
Well, you don't have to thank me.
You earned this by helping out the department on the case.
No touching!
That guy is really starting to piss me off.
In my heart, in my heart Fight!
Fight!
This was nice.
Duty calls.
I will cut you, Debby!

{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Doctor Strode, does the name Bob White mean anything to you?
Is he a children's clown?
No.
Adults only clown?
No.
He's not a clown of any sort.
You performed an autopsy on him two nights ago.
He was hit by a bus.
Oh!
Of course.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I often confuse clowns and bus victims.
Yeah, yeah, that was a That was a tragic accident.
Or was it?
It is very possible that it was not and that you made a mistake.
Ah, no.
No, Chief, I don't make mistakes.
Says the guy who left his keys in an old lady's spleen last month.
Oh, please, Detective, like you've never lost your keys.
Do you remember a missing ear lobe?
Well, this woman does.
She is the mortician who was in the process of embalming Mr. White when she discovered the inconsistency.
Hello, Woodrow.
Hello, Grace.
You two know each other?
Oh, Doctor Strode and I were in forensic school together.
We were also briefly lovers.
Ew.
The ear lobe was sliced prior to quietus and certainly not by a tire.
The incision was clean, precise as though made by a box cutter or something.
This was no accident.
The Woody I know would never have missed something like this.
Ah, no, the blood alcohol was 0.31.
He passes out, falls.
I mean, Chief, look, I may have missed this detail but I still don't know that this was a murder.
I mean, clowns fall.
I got to tell you, Woody, I'm getting a little fed up with this sloppy work.
Okay, if the Wood man says it's an accident, then so do we.
I'm going to need a little bit more than that.
All right, fine, Gus and I will hit the scene.
And don't worry.
It's going to be pro bono.
We're going to go all Haley Joel Osment on this, pay it forward.
Why can't we go all Haley Joel Osment and get paid, like he did with Country Bears?
H.J.O. Was in Country Bears?
He played a bear named Beary Barrington.
My God.
Is there anything this kid can't do?
Well, he's not really a kid anymore.
He's in his twenties.
Technically, he's a young man, 23 or something.
So this is the address on the report.
Where do you want to start?
You want to walk the scene?
Well, you are standing right where the bus ran over Bob White's body.
Why don't you just lay down?
I will not.
Gus, you're the victim.
Why do I have to be the victim?
Because to cast you as the killer wouldn't be very P.C. Since when are you P.C., Shawn?
What, do you want to be out here all night or do you want to go get some food?
Fine.
This says the street lamp directly over the bus stop was out.
Gus, you still there?
You see my face on this asphalt, Shawn.
Hurry up.
That's interesting.
So the lamp was vandalized.
Probably teenagers.
Still says accident.
I don't know.
They decided to bust one lamp and it just happens to be the street lamp that prevents the bus driver from seeing the drunkest guy in the world laying in the street?
Gentlemen.
Might I ask why this man in straight cut denim is lying in the street, while you are making bus sounds in the moonlight?
If you must know we are pantomime artists from New Guinea developing a new routine.
Look, I'm trapped in this box on casters.
Luckily, this box also has an elevator.
Goodbye.
No.
We are detectives.
And we're investigating a possible murder that happened here two nights ago at 1:00 a.m. Really?
Right here on the street.
Unbelievable.
I mean the one night that there's a murder and I was sleeping.
I never sleep.
Damn you, circadian rhythms.
You couldn't just go with the pantomime thing?
Gentlemen, my name is Whip Chatterly.
And I can tell you anything and everything you need to know.
Well, with all due respect, Whip Cream, was it?
I happen to be the head psychic detective for the SBDP and my partner here is black so I believe our bases are covered.
What does that have to do with anything?
Oh, my.
Oh, you're Shawn Spencer.
Oh, oh.
Hi.
Oh!
You guys are like celebrities to me.
That's very flattering.
Actually we don't have any headshots on us right now, but, uh Ah, to heck with it.
Why don't you give Gus a big hug?
I would love to.
How about you don't?
All right.
Listen, I would like to offer you up my prowess.
You see, I am a bit of a murder expert.
What?
Did you kill someone?
No.
But the next best thing.
This is my establishment.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know So, we have a drunken man run over by a large vehicle after he was already murdered.
This reminds me of a case from 1983 that I read about.
Wow.
That sounds cool.
Dude, we already hung out with enough crazy white people this year.
In this case, an Illinois farmer had seemingly been run over by his own tractor, but it was later discovered that the gear pedals had been adjusted for a tiny person.
Turns out he was killed with cyanide by a dwarf before he ever even got on that tractor.
They never caught that little fellow.
You saying the dwarf is still at large?
What I'm saying is that murder is always a macabre business but one made to look like an accident, well, that takes skill, knowledge, the most intricate planning.
Please turn around.
What?
Rumps facing me.
Let me see your rumps.
What's that for?
I just got it, the at large joke.
Hilarious.
Come, come.
Ooh, nice.
You have surveillance cameras.
Yes, we have three inside, and here's the outside camera.
Wow, if someone decided to commit a murder inside of that 3-foot radius, we are covered.
Okay, confession.
I just wanted to get you guys in here.
Why?
To kill us?
Look, Whip, you're rambunctious and odd and turtle-necky.
We always do enjoy meeting a true fan but it's time for Gus and I to run off into the night now.
Good night.
No.
No, no.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Would you at least bestow upon me the honor of signing my Yang book.
Ah!
Am I the only one who thought that Mary Lightly was the killer?
Wow.
You really read this closely.
Oh, I've read it 100 times.
In fact, I have read every book published on murder since 1850 to be precise.
Why are you so fascinated with murder?
I don't know.
With one terrible act, someone can become immortalized forever.
I just find it fascinating.
Now, precedent tells us that the victim's innards will tell the story of his death.
Its contents are like a clock.
Work backwards from the time of death, but you must hurry.
We know the drill, Whip, uh, we've seen The First 48.
And so have I. Every episode.
Okay, well watching it on TV and even, even reading about it in books is a little different than - Two different things.
- The real thing.
Gentlemen, allow me to be your secret weapon.
What have you got to lose?
Huh?
I will also cover the cost of all snacks.
What kind of snacks?
Keeping in mind that fruit and dried fruit are not snacks.
Food for thought.
Let's bring it in.
No?
Mr. Spencer has concluded as well that Bob White may have been murdered.
I'm sorry, Woody.
This miscue has cost us the 40 hours of lead time in solving this case.
I am willing to do whatever it takes to solve this.
I will stay here until 6:15 p.m. If need be.
Now if you'll excuse me, I will recheck for signs of head trauma.
Ah, since time is of the essence, wouldn't it be wise to start with the stomach?
It would give us an indication of where the victim has eaten in the last 18 hours.
By the way I am sensing that, uh, the stomach is probably the right place to start.
All right, look, Chief, I admit I am thrown by the idea that my mistake may have set us behind the eight ball here, but if there is a murder to be solved no one is better than me.
No one!
Well, maybe Gary Sinise.
- Maybe Sinise.
- Ms. Larson, are you a licensed examiner in this state?
Well, I keep my credentials up, but I am exercising my discretion in the county to hire you on to consult on this case.
Well, that is just insanely ridiculous.
Rim shot?
Okay, look, Dr. Strode is right.
I didn't know it was his case when I called in.
I don't want to step on anyone's toes here.
I mean, obviously the case is sensitive.
Well, she hasn't even practiced since she left school.
I mean let's face it, a mortician's nothing more than a glorified makeup artist.
Well, a makeup artist who knew to start with the abdominal cavity.
You looked better with long hair.
You look like a great big Gerber baby.
You move your lips when you read.
Is that a bald cap on your head?
Because you know what, it reminds me of one that I saw in a really bad high school production of The King and I which I've never forgotten.
By the way, I lied.
My father was never king of Sweden.
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Oh, oh, okay.
Oh, oh Pathologist fight!
Go, go, go!
Enough!
Woody, I'm trying to help you here.
Because if this case turns into an unsolved murder, and it's looking more likely by the minute that it will be, you may be out of a job.
Thank you.
Okay, Woody, let's be mature about this.
Let's not rehash old times and play power games.
Let's slice open this man's stomach and solve a murder.
What are these?
Waffle chunks?
Seriously, do we really have to be here for this?
There is lemongrass and bean paste but I also see greens.
Collard maybe?
And what appears to be potato and sugar content.
Sweet potato pie?
Where would someone have gone to have eaten both soul food and Thai?
Afro-Thai.
Phat Thai Jones.
I can't believe you called Whip.
Well, believe it, Gus, because here he is.
His vast knowledge of murder and true crime may just come in handy.
Until he kills us.
This is invigorating.
I feel tingly.
I mean, it might just be my shampoo, you know.
It's got tea tree oil in it.
Now, how do these psychic inquisitions work?
Will we be touching our subjects?
May I help you?
Yes.
Did you see this man here two nights ago?
- Hey, Singh!
- Come on.
This guy might be more helpful.
I understand you have picture?
Whoa, whoa!
Keep it down, man.
Think that accent's a little offensive?
My accent?
Offensive?
Yes.
Your accent offensive.
This is how I talk.
I'm his son.
Oh.
You're, uh Adopted, yes, okay, Bud from Cosby?
I grew up in Bangkok.
We came here three years ago.
Still have a little bit of a twang.
Yes, yes, Bob White.
Yes, of course I know him.
He's a regular.
He was here two nights ago.
He sit right over there.
Do you know what time he was here?
Gentlemen, we are standing in the presence of where Bob White was approximately seven hours before his death.
Was he here with someone?
Table for one.
He lonely.
He have no honey.
Was he drinking a lot?
Drinking?
No.
No.
He allergic to alcohol.
Allergic?
Are you sure about that, Singh?
Autopsy report said his blood alcohol level was 0.31.
No, I offer him plum wine but he say, "no".
I give him plum cake instead.
Plum cake is made with alcohol.
Teeny bit, yes, you know.
But he insists, you know, because our plum cake, it tastes like you have picked a plum straight from a tree and you stick it in a cake.
Holy Really?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
You want plum cake?
You know that's right.
Could you make that happen?
Can we have two pieces of plum cake please?
Three.
He was allergic to alcohol.
Wow, I didn't realize plum cake had that much alcohol in it.
Well that explains the dilation of the blood vessels.
Well, either way, you don't get 0.31 saturation from plum cake.
Someone with such an allergy would never be able to ingest that amount of alcohol.
Is it at all possible the alcohol could have been inserted into the bloodstream somehow?
Two things.
That is the sexiest thing I have ever heard in this office and it is possible with a syringe.
We should start scanning the body for injection marks and it could take a while.
No, he's pretty much the same old Bob White, you know.
He left half a warm Coke, oh, and also these.
But I keep for myself.
Carnival tickets?
The site of grisly murders.
Carn-Evil by Stewart Robson, Middleton Press, 1971.
Gentlemen, these are not carnival tickets, but it is going to be a hell of a ride.
That's weird.
All right, got it.
That was Woody.
Grace found an injection site in Bob's left foot, so apparently the alcohol was pumped directly into his bloodstream.
Ooh!
Was the injection site between the second and third toe?
Yeah, it was.
How did you know that?
Oh!
Straight out of Lost In The Parade.
Tyne Hannerman, Soji Press, 1931.
The point is, somebody handpicked this guy.
It was controlled, calculated, cold-blooded.
We've arrived at Bob's next destination.
Hi, hi.
Where the hell are we?
When the hell are we?
Gentlemen, we are standing in a retro dime-a-dance hall.
One of the last of its kind.
Here, regular fellows can dress up like servicemen on leave from the 1930s, and offer up a coupon to trip the light fantastic with one of these alluring and voluptuous women.
And how do you know about this place?
Because I am a lonely individual.
And so was Bob White.
Now, look at this.
Any one of these creatures could have authored his demise.
We're going to need reinforcements.
Who?
Who are you thinking of going with?
You said you had a priority one case that involved my skills.
Yes, your dancing skills.
Who are you?
I'm Whip Chatterly.
Look, Dad, we only have a couple of hours to question all these voluptuous women.
We need your help.
Woody's about to get fired.
I don't know, Shawn.
Count me in.
Does the name Bob White mean anything to you?
Can't say that it does.
Can I call you Captain Magic?
Yeah.
Does this man's image incite anything in you?
I'm sorry, honey.
I don't do three-ways.
I was wondering Shh!
Don't waste your breath, brown sugar.
You just let Sandy hold you tight and all the pain will melt away like butter.
Actually, I'm doing great.
But my friend Bob White, so sad.
Did you know him?
What?
Oh, I'm the A-hole?
Shawn!
Shawn!
I just can't believe anybody would want to kill that poor little man.
Really?
Why is that so hard to believe?
Because Bobby wouldn't hurt a fly.
He used to come in here and dance with me for hours because he just lost his mama.
He'd lay his head right here.
And I'd just let him fall asleep.
That sounds real nice.
Um.
Shawn?
Hang in there, buddy.
Sandy, did Bob come here to dance and nap on your bosom two nights ago?
He did.
It was the worst I've ever seen him.
He seemed paranoid and he kept going on and on about somebody following him.
Being followed.
Oh!
This reminds me of a case that occurred in Salt Lake City in 1992.
Oh, it was a stormy winter Spit it out, Whip.
I think Gus is losing consciousness.
I'm seeing double.
I think our killer was scouting Bob.
I mean he was a lonely guy, you know, kept a regular routine.
Who would miss him?
Sandy, where would Bob go when he was finished with the pleasure of your company?
The other night, he seemed so down.
So I sent him to a friend of mine.
I asked her for a special favor.
You sent him to a brothel?
What?
No!
My girl operates on a more spiritual level.
Gentlemen, we stand four hours from Bob White's last breath.
Huh.
This is all you, Shawny boy.
You suck it, Gus.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Miss Ivana, our friend Shawn here is a psychic, too.
Maybe you want to test him out before you answer our questions.
- Dude, what are you doing?
- Shh!
No talk.
You!
Look at my brain.
I'd rather not.
Do it.
Okay.
What do you see?
Um.
Ooh.
You are putting up a wall.
You don't want me to see your naked, innermost thoughts.
True.
I have trust issues.
My therapist tells me this.
Your turn.
Have at it.
I'm an open book.
You were thinking whether Ted Knight and Jim J. Bullock had anything to talk about on the set of Too Close For Comfort.
Holy crap, she's the real deal.
Wow.
Your turn again, Shawn.
This time try to let your guard down.
Gus, we are here to investigate.
I believe you know this man.
Golly.
How many potted plants does it take to spell loser?
If it turns out this was a suicide, I can't say I blame the guy.
Ugh.
Don't be ugly, Carlton.
What?
All right, what do you want to check?
The empty answering machine or the letters addressed to resident?
Yes, he came to see me the other night.
He was very sad.
He tells me he's in love with beautiful woman.
Really?
What's her name?
Penny.
He said she is so beautiful he can watch her all day long pouring the tea or reading the paper.
Even the way she folding the laundry is a thing of beauty.
So I tell him she cares for him.
Oh!
What do you know?
She was into old Bob, huh?
No.
I only told him this because big Sandy asked me to.
I owe her a favor for introducing me to Chad Lowe at pajama party at the Playboy mansion.
You lied to him?
I had to.
Chad wasn't going to get with a fortune teller.
I'm not talking about Chad, I am talking about Bob.
Yes.
Him too.
Aw!
But he was so happy.
He rush out of here to go and see her.
This is an outrage!
Shame your face!
Poor Bob!
Who is now very, very sad.
You want to know why?
Mostly because he's dead!
Say what?
Murder!
Nuh-uh!
I hope you're satisfied.
Oh, my God, you guys, seriously?
This is all my fault.
I'm going to go to hell in a handbasket.
Uh.
What happened to your accent?
People are more comfortable when I use it.
No.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no.
We are leaving.
To find a girl named Penny.
Damn, girl, what's wrong with you?
I see death in you.
Me?
No.
The reaper is coming to collect your soul.
No, no, wrong again.
Um, oh, see, yes, I get this all the time.
You know, actually it's because death is my business.
Isuse Boze.
Don't.
Ah.
Ooh.
I know what it is, uh, I've got a dead tooth and a toenail that's gone completely black.
Leave, now!
All of you get out!
Shoo!
Okay.
Shoo!
Don't got to tell me twice.
Bad juju!
Bad juju!
Bad juju!
Well, that was unsavory.
Don't sweat it, Whip, okay?
She was a freak.
Trust me.
Full of bologna.
Yeah, that shorty was whack.
Gentlemen, I appreciate you both working overtime to put me at ease, but I think maybe it's time I leave the residue of this deadly cryptogram to those far more equipped to decode it than I. What I'm trying to say is that I'm freaked out.
I guess that the least we can do is, uh, we'll give you a ride home.
Ah!
What?
Much appreciated.
Um Would it be out of line to make a quick stop at Arby's on the way home?
No, it would not.
That's happening for sure.
Okay.
I'll be damned.
Hey, hey, I got something!
Penny?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Looks like Mr. Lonely wasn't so lonely after all.
Let's pay her a visit and make this little piggy squeal.
Or we could just ask her some questions.
We could, but it's never as much fun.
Hey, Shawn.
Jules, I'm having a very strong feeling about our guy Bob and the name Penny.
Does that mean anything to you?
Yeah, it does.
I got to tell you, Lassie, investigating this neighborhood has been pretty bizarre.
Underbelly.
Kind of like After Hours.
Without the comforting presence of Griffin Dunne.
Please, Spencer, if anyone knows the underbelly of Santa Barbara, it's me.
So I'll do the talking, all right?
I know these people.
And I'm a highly trained communicator, able to adapt into any situation.
I'm a master chameleon.
You're not a master chameleon.
Watch this.
It's open!
Hey, Chalmers?
Of course.
Who else would I be, silly?
I am not silly.
In fact, I'm quite the opposite.
Head Detective Carlton Lassiter, of the SBPD I'm here to talk to you about Bob White.
Oh, yeah.
Well, come on in.
I'm just about to make some tea.
Oh, yeah, this girl's got underbelly written all over her.
Detectives, please, have a seat.
Make yourselves at home.
Wake up, Sebastian.
This could get interesting.
Break a leg, Master C. What the hell is going on?
He said she's so beautiful that he can watch her all day.
The way she pours the tea or reads the paper.
Oh!
She's a performance artist.
Guys like Bob White pay money to watch her live her everyday life.
You serious?
All right, beatniks, show's over.
Hit the road.
Are you people dense?
This is official police business.
Get out of here!
Whoo-hoo!
Spencer, you going to help me out here?
Yes, we are.
The female cop's got a presence but, uh, Detective Gangly is a bit stiff, don't you think?
Hey, Officer, no need to be nervous.
It's going to be okay.
This is just life imitating art.
Now, no lines, just life.
So go ahead, ask me anything you want.
Uh, look!
Miss, I, um We can't hear you!
Uh Do you know Bob White?
Yeah, why?
We know him.
Well, I don't really know if you want an audience for this, but Bob is dead.
My sweet Bobby is dead?
We believe he was murdered.
Oh, Bobby!
No!
Kind of cliché.
Well, someone may have been stalking him for a while, if that helps.
Oh, yeah, that does.
Oh, Bobby, no All right, that is it!
You either get these people out of here, or I'm going to haul you downtown.
We're going to set up all the chairs in the holding cell.
How's that for honesty and truth?
Does that cost extra?
Get them out of here.
Let's go!
Come on!
Bye.
Thanks, thanks for coming.
Did you complete the residue test on those fingernails like a good boy?
I did.
I found a mixture of pigment fillers in the nail beds.
Is there anything hotter than a man scaling another man's dead cuticles?
Nope.
And by the way, I realize I'm actually acutely turned on by taking orders from a woman.
If this continues, I might have to change my Facebook relationship status to "it's complicated".
Are you trying to seduce me?
Maybe.
Is it working?
It's not not working.
How's Elaine?
We're separated.
She cheated on me 12 times with 10 men.
Not a very smart woman.
That's why I married her.
You know, I do not appreciate being made a part of your little dog and pony show.
Oh, I don't work with animals.
You think I'm kidding around?
I could take you downtown for obstruction of justice.
Easy, okay?
I'm a performance artist.
I just thought I'd take the opportunity to milk the drama when a bunch of detectives showed up.
That is an odd way to make a living.
It's way less creepy than doing web cam feeds.
And it sure beats the hell out of my last gig.
Doing spots for Howza Meats.
Wait a second.
You're the bologna girl?
I knew I recognized you.
I just couldn't remember where.
Howza, Howza, Howza meats You tell me Bah, bah, bah, bologna!
Are you quite done, Guster?
Bah, bah, bah, bologna!
She does it twice.
In the commercial.
I do it twice.
I'm done.
What can you tell us about Bob White?
He would come to the show almost every day but we never spoke.
Two nights ago, he came in, it was really late.
I told him the show was over for the night.
And he insisted on coming in.
And then he professed his love for me.
He said that a fortune teller told him I loved him too.
He had no honey.
That is not offensive.
That is exactly how the white waiter sounded.
Gus was there.
Please tell me you let him down easy.
I'm sensing he was very vulnerable.
No, I threatened to call the cops.
But you're the bologna girl.
Yeah, but I'm also a single girl in the city.
Who invites an entire audience of strangers into her apartment.
Any idea where he went after you ripped his heart out and stepped on it?
I watched him from the window.
He walked down the street.
And then this black Impala pulled up.
And then he was talking to the driver and then he got in.
Great.
It's only the most popular car in America.
What time did all of this go down?
Midnight.
Well, he died around 1:00.
Which means whoever picked him up in that car is probably the last person who saw him alive.
Mostly likely because they're also the person who killed him.
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bologna!
Hello, boys.
Ah!
I had to go to three stores to find crème fraîche for our strawberries.
Well, I think we squeezed all we can out of these intestines.
Mmm!
Worth the wait.
That is fresh fraîche.
We are quite the team, Grace and I. As it turns out, we also still enjoy both Jerry Garcia and Cherry Garcia.
Guys, uh, here's what we know.
Someone drove him away in what may have been an Impala?
Impala.
Okay.
And that's where the trail runs cold.
What you're doing is positively disgusting.
Why are you still messing with that?
Because it feels amazing.
Oh, uh.
I don't know what this will mean to you but I found a mixture of calcium carbonate, titanium oxide and pigment fillers in the nail beds.
Hmm.
Those are the common elements of acrylic stains.
Paint?
I was just about to say that.
No, you weren't.
Right, Guster.
In addition, there was a string of muriatic acid.
That's a preserving agent.
We're probably talking about an outdoor location.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
You want more plum cake?
I do, but no.
You preserve a mural.
I watched him from the window.
He was walking down the street.
And then this black Impala pulls up.
And he's talking to the driver and then he got in.
Okey doke.
The killer drove Bob to this alley from Penny's, made him get out, turns him around, boom, bludgeons him over the head.
So, do it.
Bludgeon me.
What?
Bludgeon me.
Why me, Shawn?
All you do is complain about being the victim.
Now I'm offering you the role of the killer, just like Blair Underwood in Just Cause, and you're gonna pass?
I don't want to bludgeon you.
Just do it.
I don't want to bludgeon you.
Bludgeon me!
Bludgeon me!
Bludgeon me!
Fine.
Holy crap!
Whip's our killer.
What?
Look!
He absolutely needed us to solve this murder.
He wanted to get caught.
With one terrible act, someone can be immortalized forever.
I think it's fascinating.
Exactly.
He wants to go down in history just like all the killers that he studies.
And if this goes unsolved, then no one is going to write about it.
Oh!
I bet he severed the earlobe just to launch the investigation.
That's why he wanted to tag along, to make sure we figured out all the clues.
Of course.
This thing is so twisted, it could only come from a book.
I'm calling Lassie.
I'll have him meet us at Whip's.
The black Impala.
Chatterly, get out of the car!
We've got a body.
We got something else too.
"Thank you, Shawn and Gus, for being the sleuths I always knew you were.
"And for helping me find my rightful place in the annals of murder history.
"File this under 'C' for Chatterly".
Geez, Whip.
I knew it.
You did not.
I kinda did.
Damn you, Whip Chatterly!
You ensnared us in a web of turtleneck lies.
And now because of you, we don't have any snacks.
You just can't tell what a person is capable of until you've seen them naked.
Hmm.
I'm almost positive that's how the saying goes.
Mmm Cakesters?
You betcha.
Ooh.
Yep, I have learned my lesson.
If it wasn't for you guys, I'd be out of a job.
Well.
From now on, I'm not half-assing any autopsies.
Unless the corpse has half an ass.
You got to keep it light, guys.
Sure do.
I think we're going to roll, Woodster.
I've got back to back episodes of Hot in Cleveland on TiVo and we're pretty spent.
Yeah.
Whoa, Gus.
I have a missed call from Whip.
What?
Yeah, like an hour before we found his body.
He left a message.
Creepiest butt dial ever.
Wait a minute, I gotta hear that again.
What is wrong with you, Shawn?
The man is committing sui Shh!
Listen.
All right, what does that sound like to you?
I don't know.
Yes, you do.
That is a car door slamming after the gunshot.
We got to get back to Whip's bookstore.
What are we doing here, Shawn?
Looking for signs of a struggle.
Oh, my gosh.
I don't want to be here for one more second than we have to be.
This doesn't add up, Gus, and you know it.
We're going to figure out why.
What?
Come on, son!
You going to drink a dead man's Yoo-Hoo?
You had to put that image in my head, didn't you?
The man may be dead but that Yoo-Hoo is very much alive, Shawn.
I'm going inside.
Suck it.
Suck that.
Gus, you're not going to die for letting a Yoo-Hoo go to waste.
Whip did.
This investigation is not over and you know it.
Shawn, I don't want to be here.
I feel like I'm in one of those movies where a little Japanese kid in death makeup is going to be up on the ceiling like a frog if I look up.
So, don't look up.
Besides, why would you possibly feel that way?
I don't know.
And what are you doing up there?
You're closer to the ceiling?
I don't know, Shawn.
Maybe because I'm starving to death.
I gave you my Cakester!
That was almost half an hour ago.
Come on, son.
Wait for it.
Dude.
What do we have here?
Why is Whip watching old surveillance footage?
So, we have five tapes.
And on each one of them, the same weirdo's reading one of these five books.
In this case, an Illinois farmer had seemingly been run over by his own tractor.
But later, it was discovered he was killed with cyanide by a dwarf before he ever even got on that tractor.
They never caught that little fellow.
Dude, what are you doing?
Oh!
You scared me.
Are those homemade biscotti?
Is there any other kind?
You look happy.
Well, I guess I am.
Do you still take sugar with your joe?
Mmm.
Hey, what is all that?
You don't want to know.
Let's pretend we're doing an episode of Red Shoe Diaries.
Well, not if there's work to be done.
Fine.
The contents of Whip Chatterly's esophagus.
Well, I thought the case was closed.
It is.
It was.
Or that's what I thought.
But now I'm not so sure.
These were folded up into tiny bits and put inside this metal capsule.
This is new evidence and it could be a game changer.
I think we may have to pull another all-nighter.
God, I love this job.
You know, I do too.
Okay, clearly there's a reason why these pages are torn.
Dude, I think Whip was framed.
Why?
Because he was the perfect mark.
A weirdo obsessed with death and strange murders throughout history.
I mean, we didn't question it for a second when we heard his suicide confession.
Think about it.
So, it was creepy Sherlock.
Well, this makes sense.
I mean, he obviously did all of his research right here, in Whip's store.
Probably even had a conversation with him.
That's sick.
The one night that there's a murder and I was sleeping.
Unbelievable.
I never sleep.
Ah!
He must have drugged Whip's coffee.
That's why he fell asleep the night Bob White was murdered.
He took Whip's car, he took Whip's stamp.
And he put it all back before he ever knew what hit him.
Oh man, now I feel bad.
Poor Whip.
You know, he was a funny guy.
And I've thought about rocking the turtleneck.
But then I think about what you would say and then, what people at work would say.
Whip never worried about stuff like that.
He was fearless.
Gus.
What?
This is really, really not good.
Well, we can send these to the lab in the morning, I'll dust them for prints.
Oh!
That's odd.
I thought they were going home to watch Hot in Cleveland.
He must have come up with something, as well.
I should fill him in.
Um.
I'm afraid that's not going to be possible.
Well, it's such an easy task, even I can't screw it up.
Have some faith, banana.
Grace, what are you doing?
That's evidence.
You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you, Woody?
I mean, the case was closed.
All the evidence pointed to this dummy doing it.
I mean, he even confessed.
All you had to do was cover him up, eat some cookies and then take me to bed.
We can still go two for three.
Let's go.
Grace, it's Woody.
Don't you owe me an explanation?
You want an explanation?
Yes.
Okay.
Whip Chatterly set me up by swallowing that little capsule.
He was smarter than I gave him credit for.
Crafty, like a little fox.
I mean, whose fingerprints do you think the lab is going to find on those stupid little pieces of paper?
Huh?
For 25 years, I had been putting makeup on corpses, dreaming of the day that I would get the call when somebody would tell me that I was as good as Woody Strode.
Teacher's pet, brilliant, but misunderstood.
A dream worth killing for?
Come on.
I have applied for every opening in crime pathology this side of the Gulf of Mexico, with no success.
And then, I met Bob White.
And I realized that he was the perfect mark.
I mean, you know, it was really kind of a mercy killing.
But when I got the idea of pinning the murder on Whip Chatterly, it was epic.
I broke open the case, and then I solved it.
I beat you, Woody.
I owned you.
You sliced the earlobe after my autopsy, didn't you?
Yes, muttonhead, I did.
And you know what?
You and the police had ruled it an accident.
But I needed it to be an investigation.
You know, you may not realize this, Grace, but you're insane.
Well, I'm a woman, and I can mask it.
Let's go.
You are totally going to pull this off, aren't you?
No, I'm not ready to die.
I still haven't seen Gloria Estefan in concert yet.
Please!
Please, Grace.
I will get down on my knees.
And I will beg like a Saint Bernard!
No!
That won't be necessary.
Put it down, Grace.
Oh, thank God!
Well, that was quite the all-nighter, Woodrow.
You're very lucky that O'Hara was still here doing paperwork when Shawn called.
Chief, uh, I just want you to know that, uh Hey, I only cried because I was tired.
That's reassuring.
Your status as chief coroner has been fully restored.
Yes!
That said, I expect your work to be nothing short of exemplary, moving forward.
Is that clear?
It is.
And I cannot thank you enough for believing in me.
I didn't.
I believed in your colleague who turned out to be a homicidal maniac.
None of us is perfect, Chief.
Thanks for looking out for me.
I love you guys.
I mean that.
You know, it's just as easy for me to love a man as it is a woman.
We're all just meltable flesh and breakable bones.
Wow, this feels good!
Chief, are you currently seeing anyone?
Excuse me?
Woody!
Don't be coy with me.
I don't need to play first fiddle in this bluegrass band.
Teach me the notes.
I am married with a child and this is wildly inappropriate.
Stop it.
Of course.
Of course.
I apologize.
I am just so overjoyed at getting my mojo back.
I guess it'll just be in my dreams that you are the chief of doing me.
What?
Good job, Chief!
Oh, is that I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
And we're live outside of Lompoc state prison where at any moment now, these gates will open and out will walk Thane Woodson.
Woodson's conviction for robbing a local Santa Barbara restaurant was overturned after lawyers from the Innocence Project were able to get faulty eyewitness testimony thrown out.
We're expecting a statement.
Let's go and see right now.
Today's another great day for justice.
And a great day for the Innocence Project.
Um.
This moment, a moment of joy, reconciliation and hope for the future reminds us of our common humanity.
I lost everything!
I want it back!
Y'all owe me!
Okay, what my client means is that Look, state penal code 4903 states that I'm owed restitution.
I know my rights.
I have a law degree.
Okay, he doesn't have a law degree.
I'm close!
Okay, he might have taken some classes.
But in the eyes of the state he's not due restitution until the real culprit is captured and proven guilty.
That's what I'll do then.
After I get my law degree I'll enroll in the police academy and become a detective.
Okay, he's not enrolling in the academy.
Then I will find somebody else to help me.
Excuse me.
He's very excited.
We all are.
So you want us to solve a crime that you were wrongfully convicted of?
I heard you were one hell of a psychic from the very men that you put in jail.
That's not surprising.
I'm sure my reputation in prison has reached mythical proportions.
Not really.
But there is a long list of felons fixing to kill you as soon as they get out.
Why just me?
This is a two-man team!
Stop snitching, Shawn.
Here's my case file.
I did some hard time in violation of California penal codes 459 and 211.
Mmm.
Rubbed up against a woman on a subway.
No.
Wait, that's 458.
How do you know that?
It's burglary and armed robbery.
My client is well versed in legal matters.
Oh, you better recognize.
Oh, that's horrible, man.
You must have lost everything.
How long were you incarcerated?
Two years, eight months.
Wow.
That's what I'm talking about.
I was getting ready to say That's a long-ass time, I know.
So, even though the convictions were overturned, we still must prove that Thane didn't commit the crimes in the first place.
And the best way to do that would be to find the person that actually did.
That's where you come in.
Hmm.
Excuse us one second.
What you think?
I don't know.
This guy could be a handful.
What makes you say that?
You saw Penitentiary.
Which one?
All three of them.
You're right, I got this.
Mmm.
Here's the thing, Thane.
There is not a doubt in our minds that you're an innocent man.
But this is a lot for a couple dudes like us to take on.
And, and we're actually pretty busy at the moment.
Uh Yeah, I'm afraid we're just, we're not up for this one.
You know, I understand it's a lot for me to come in here and ask you to Fight my fight for me.
But I lost everything.
I was once just like you.
I had dreams, had a girl.
Gus doesn't have a girl.
Shawn.
I couldn't have my girl wait 10 to 15 years for me, so I told her, "You go out and you find somebody "that'll make you happy".
Somebody that can make phone calls for at least more than 15 minutes.
She got married while I was stuck in jail.
I know it's only been two years and eight months but I'm starting from scratch.
So please, help me fight the injustice that was done to me.
Man, I've changed my mind.
He set his girl free.
Like in Hurricane.
She got married quick.
I know.
You're damn right we're going to help!
You don't know how happy you've made a brother feel right now.
Give it to me.
I've got to tell you, I've never had a cause before.
This is awesome.
We're going to fight the power!
Fight the power!
Together!
Together!
Shawn, don't get all Spike Lee and Do The Right Thing on me.
It's too late for that, brother.
Love is going to bust him out.
He's already out, Shawn.
Just because you put syrup on something don't make it pancakes.
What?
Hey, Jules.
You're not going to believe the case we just landed.
We're basically civic heroes now.
I prefer freedom fighters.
Uh-huh.
What we're doing is much more exciting than anything you will have going on inside there.
Nothing in there is as cool as what's happening right here.
Oh, I am sure you're right.
We are.
Okay, I'll bite.
What's the case?
Well, in order to really appreciate it you have to first hear the back story.
Yeah.
Once upon a time a poor country boy in search of a better life brushes off his overalls, hops on a freight, and leaves the dusty roads of Georgia behind.
Shawn, that's Grapes of Wrath and it wasn't a freight and it wasn't Georgia.
Thane wasn't alive then.
He had no formal education, but he did know a hundred uses for the peanut.
That's George Washington Carver.
Thane has a Masters in culinary arts.
So he moved to Santa Barbara and bought a horse.
That's true.
And in no time at all he got a job as a head chef.
Then his life took a tragic turn when his restaurant was robbed.
He was at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
Got arrested, spent three long years in the big house.
Not the clink?
For a crime he didn't commit.
Why?
Faulty eyewitness testimony.
Unfair justice system and Me.
Trying to make this about you.
Come on.
This is our case.
You're talking about Thane Woodson and that restaurant robbery was my case.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right, then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I spent three weeks on this case.
I found the gun that was used in the robbery in Thane's car with his prints on it.
Allegedly.
He's definitely guilty.
I don't know, Jules.
There's a grand jury that disagrees with you on that.
So you two breaking up over this?
No.
Of course not.
Well, don't forget.
I used to be involved with someone on the force and it gets very tricky keeping work issues from becoming personal.
Now that I'm dating an incarcerated civilian, things are much simpler.
Minus the two inch glass and the leg shackles.
Well, we appreciate your concern, Carlton, but I don't take it personally that Shawn took on Thane's case.
Even though I am fairly certain that he is guilty.
And I don't take it personally that Juliet feels that way.
Even though, she simply couldn't be wronger.
You two are so breaking up over this.
And Spencer, remember.
All convicts say they're innocent, or they're framed, or stop choking me, but at the end of the day, Thane Woodson was definitely guilty of something.
Not according to the Innocence Project.
Which is why they're high on my list of enemies.
Right behind Internal Affairs, Unicef, and Lance Bass.
Don't ask.
Look, I am confident that I did good police work.
Look, I am sure you did, Jules but we all make mistakes, right?
So you put an innocent man behind bars for three years.
I threw out the comics yesterday before Gus had a chance to read FoxTrot.
Shawn.
Listen, according to the Innocence Project, the restaurant owner who I.D.'d Thane she's in glasses with an expired prescription.
Well, then it's the D.A.'s fault for using eyewitness testimony as the crux of the case.
I agree.
The D.A. Is to blame.
Now I'm going to make it right.
I'm going to go fight for Thane.
Me.
So when things fall apart with Spencer and you, Marlowe and I met the perfect person.
That means that person is in prison.
And is a woman.
Which one of those is a problem?
Table four is up!
Look, we appreciate you taking some time to speak with us, Mercer.
You have a lovely restaurant, by the way.
Thank you.
I assume you know that Thane has been exonerated.
Yes, I do.
Listen, I don't want to create an awkward situation but I'm sure you remember the man your testimony put in jail.
Look, I don't want any trouble, all right?
I feel horrible what happened to you.
Mmm-hmm.
You know what?
We can end this cycle right here, right now.
I forgive you, man.
Thanks, man, I'm sorry.
All right.
You know what, you were always my best cook.
And I didn't think in a million years you could do anything like that.
But the police told me that the gun used in the robbery was found in your car.
Mmm-hmm.
They told me the robbery smacked of an inside job.
I was under a lot of pressure to say it was you and I'm sorry.
I get it.
You know what the funny thing about pressure is?
I went to jail because of you!
You know that?
Okay, I said I'm sorry, man.
Relax, all right?
I lost my youth because of you!
You're only two years older.
Hey man, I'm a dinosaur!
You are not a dinosaur.
This is not helping your cause.
Okay.
My bad.
It's just, this prison thing got a hold of me, man.
Tight.
It's still controlling me.
Yeah.
It's all right.
I'm sorry.
So, now we need you to tell us everything you can remember about the night of the robbery.
Yeah, okay.
Um.
I came in right after closing time and that's when I found one of my kitchen workers sitting right here, with his hands tied with those, um, beaded zip-tie things.
Now he was reciting the alphabet backwards.
Whoa, alphabet?
That sounds like the same M.O. Of that unsolved convenience store robbery from last month.
He tied my hands behind my back and, uh, made me recite the alphabet backwards.
You guys know that that food's not free just 'cause you're working the case, right?
Now, I immediately untied him and that's when I heard the gun shot coming from over there.
Now, I looked up and I saw a man who certainly looked like Thane, climbing out that back window.
Okay, now if there's nothing else, if you can excuse me, I've got a lunch rush I got to deal with here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, excuse you?
Excuse me?
Do you think this is Law And Order?
You don't get to decide when the interview is over.
We decide.
Just go back to making some sauce.
Do you have anything else you want to say to this dude?
Not at all.
Okay, guess what?
Now it's over.
Now the interview's over.
And we're going to leave because we've made the rules.
I wash my hands of you, sir.
Man, what if the same dude that robbed the Stop 'N Gulp robbed this place three years ago?
Then we can solve that case and link the bad guy to this robbery.
Thane's proven innocent and gets his settlement from the state.
And a chance at a new life like in Carlito's Way.
Until the game pulls him back in.
Which you know it will.
I've got all this soap on my hand.
That's what you get for trying to be bad.
I am having a psychic suspicion that the person who robbed you last month committed a similar crime three years ago.
Uh, don't look now but I think that's the guy that robbed us What?
We told you to wait at the Psych office.
How did you even get here?
I rode my bike.
And I'm sick and tired of people like you saying I fit the description of a criminal.
Sorry, dude.
Maybe you should, I don't know, look different or something.
Look diff You know what's sorry?
The state prison system where I spent three years.
I thought you said it was two years and eight months.
I'm rounding up, all right?
And who are you?
The math police?
Why don't you Ice Cube it down a notch or two, or five?
Okay, cool, my bad.
Yeah.
Okay.
We good?
- Snowflake.
- There it is.
Come on.
Come on.
We good?
We good?
Yeah.
That's the real thing right there, Gus.
We good.
I'm also sensing that you're you're not really stressing the robbery because you're fully insured here.
I wish.
The insurance adjuster just called and apparently the store alarm was on but the zone by the back window where the burglar escaped wasn't working.
So, now it's my fault.
Wow, your life sucks.
I'm also sensing that you did some work here to the store before the break in.
Is that right?
Yeah.
Actually we had some renovations a few days before.
Hey, that's nice, Shawn.
Hey, say, man, how'd you get like that?
What, did someone kick you in the head?
Oh.
You got Creole in your blood?
No, Thane, much like Lady Gaga, I was born this way.
And while I don't have a meat dress, I do have a tie made entirely of beef jerky.
If you don't want to tell me the truth, Shawn, just say so.
Don't lie to me.
No, it's true.
Beef jerky.
Really?
Yeah.
Hello, Father.
Hey, Shawn, you still working the zip ties lead for Thane Woodson?
Yeah, why?
We just got a call about a jewelry store robbery.
Guess what the robber used to tie up the sales clerk with?
A bunch of bureaucratic red tape?
Red Vines?
What?
Beaded zip ties.
The exact kind used at the Stop 'N Gulp robbery and the restaurant robbery that Thane was arrested for.
Get out of here.
We're on it.
Thank you.
Dude, we're out.
Oh, hi, Shawn.
Hey, Jules.
Hey, can we move dinner from seven to eight?
Thane is guilty.
Sure.
Eight actually works better for me.
He's innocent.
You two are ridiculous.
Seriously.
Yeah, actually we did some renovations a few days before.
He said the store alarm was on but the zone by the back window where the burglar escaped wasn't working.
One, two, three, eyes on me.
As they should.
I am having a psychic vision that there was a recent renovation here.
Yes, we just moved this wall back.
Oh.
I'm also sensing that the alarm didn't trip when the intruder gained entry.
You're right.
I had to push the panic button behind the counter to notify the police myself.
Just as I suspected.
This robbery and the Stop 'N Gulp robbery from last month were committed by the same culprit.
Someone tampered with the alarm wires while the renovations were going on and then broke into the window where they knew the security breach was.
Well, thank you for that private theory, Spencer.
We'll keep it in mind while we conduct our official investigation.
Ma'am, can you describe the suspect?
Well, he looked a lot like that gentleman, right there.
Oh, boy.
Thane, how did you get here?
I rode the bus.
And lady, I was nowhere near your store.
Can anyone corroborate that?
Yeah.
Two other people who thought I robbed two other places.
Okay, but you can't be here anyway, so vamoose.
No, you vamoose, cop.
Santa Barbara municipal code 9.0.
001 says that I have a right to be here as long as I don't wander, linger or drift in an aimless manner and I aim to holler at my boy Shawn.
Holler.
That's why we shouldn't allow books in prison.
Or water.
Would you show me that panic button please?
Uh, Thane, you You remember Detective Juliet O'Hara, don't you?
Mmm-hmm.
Look, this is hard for me to say but, uh, the flaws the Innocence Project found in the case against you Mmm-hmm.
Along with Shawn's psychic vision makes me wonder if I was wrong about you, Thane.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm the kind of person that would never, ever, ever forgive myself if I thought I put the wrong person behind bars.
So, if the real culprit is still out there, believe me, I want to find him more than anyone.
Oh, hell, no!
Man, I ain't feeling her at all.
She part of the system that stole my life!
Thane, Thane, I can personally vouch for Juliet here, especially now that she agrees with me.
We're all on the same team.
Oh, well, then you ain't on my team then.
What?
Last thing we need is for her to plant evidence to frame some other dude.
Jules, we've We've got your back on this.
There's There's not two teams.
Thane.
We work with Juliet all the time.
Besides, it's the other one that's most likely to plant the evidence.
Either you work separate from the police or you don't get your $10,000.
What $10,000?
I agreed to pay you 10% of my restitution if you help me get it.
You didn't get the contract that Mandelbaum sent over?
What contract?
I flipped through it.
It was full of words.
Well, your share of it is $10,000.
Excuse us one second.
Jules, uh, did you Did you really mean it when you said you weren't going to take me working with Thane personally?
Yes.
Good.
Because like you said, Gus and I do have a business to run.
And ten grand is good for business.
Totally understand.
I knew you would.
Cool.
Okay, uh I can't talk to you and we should probably cancel dinner because that'll just be awkward.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on.
Okay, great.
Well, thank you for calling me back.
I appreciate it.
Who were you talking to?
Don't worry about it, Gus.
And just as we suspected, both the Stop 'N Gulp and the jewelry store hired the same contractor for recent renovations.
Derrick Poole.
Which means he would have had access to the alarm wires when the walls were open.
And if we can pin this restaurant robbery on this Poole guy, that means I can get my restitution money!
We are aware of this, Thane.
Shawn, are you sure this is not going to be a problem between you and Juliet?
I don't know.
She seemed a little A little what?
Eh She's okay Man, prove it to you right now.
Hey, Jules.
Hi Shawn.
Hey, I was just calling to make sure you're cool, you know, with the fact that we chose to stay with Thane.
Oh, of course I am.
You are?
Really?
Look at us.
Who said we couldn't separate the personal stuff from the work stuff?
But we built a wall of separation that's made of adult relationship awesomeness.
I'm going to make you a Bundt cake.
Hmm.
I told you, man, I know me and Jules.
I know me and Jules.
Really?
Then why is she putting our key suspect into the car right now?
What?
Jules!
Hey, uh, what's this?
Oh, well, we linked one of Poole's company cars to the jewelry store crime scene using video surveillance from the store across the street.
We're bringing him in for questioning.
Uh, you think we could, uh, talk to him for a few minutes first?
It would be very helpful to the Thane case.
Oh.
No.
You said you didn't want any help from the police, so you're not getting any.
What happened to us not taking our work personally?
Oh.
Sorry, Shawn.
I can't talk to you.
I can't believe this.
We just got blocked.
Y'all just got cop blocked.
But who needs the police when you got a psychic?
Huh?
You know that's right.
Tampered with the alarm?
Not to my knowledge.
But you were the only contractor hired to conduct the work at the Stop 'N Gulp?
Officer McNab, please escort Mr. Spencer away from here.
He's to have nothing to do with this case, per orders of Detective O'Hara.
You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
I do like it when you get your comeuppance.
I like it when you shut-up-ance.
Get him out of here.
Come on, Buzz, you know I only want to ask this dude a couple questions.
I'm sorry, Shawn, but I have my orders.
All right.
But if I can't talk to him, I'm going to talk to his workers.
That may be kind of hard.
He only uses day laborers.
How do you know that?
I responded to union complaints about Poole using them on union jobs.
Any chance of you keeping that very valuable information away from Lassiter and Juliet?
Of course not.
Well, then there's only one thing for me to do.
We're going under cover as day laborers?
Worst idea ever.
Do you know how many terrible ideas you're not accounting for by saying that?
This is where Poole hires his guys, man.
Just try to fit in.
Don't worry, I have a hammer.
You just loogied on my shoe.
I'm creating a character.
Hammerin' Gus.
He's disgusting.
He's misunderstood.
What does that mean?
He's been through a lot, Shawn.
Hey, man, you, uh, you happen to do any work for Derrick Poole?
No.
It's really hard to get a job with him.
No.
No.
No!
Fine, fine, take it!
If you're looking to get in with Señor Poole, you're out of luck.
He's what we call muy delicado.
He has a deli for cows?
It means he's picky, Shawn.
You have to know drywall, electrical, plumbing Clearly I'm qualified.
I will punch you in the face.
Look, man, we tried to get on the, uh, Stop 'N Gulp and jewelry store jobs he had last month, it was completely full.
I worked a day on that Stop 'N Gulp job.
Store looks good now, huh?
Wow, man, you know anybody who worked both jobs?
There was only one guy, Carl.
Carl?
Do you know where we can find Carl?
Who wants to know?
Just our good friend Mr. Benjamin Jackson.
Haven't seen him since.
But uh, he did get dropped off a couple blocks before me on Arroyo.
Ah!
Three amigos!
Mucho fuerte.
You!
Dad!
Shawn, what are you doing here?
What am I I knew you were lying when you said you built that deck all by yourself.
I don't know what you're talking about.
we're going to Arroyo.
Boom-boom.
Thanks for letting me tag along, fellows.
You were hiding in the backseat.
Well, thanks for leaving your extra set of car keys in plain sight in the back of your desk drawer.
Look, Thane, just play it cool, all right?
We think this Carl guy may be responsible for the last two robberies plus the one that you were blamed Can I help you?
Uh, maybe.
We're looking for a dude named Carl, supposed to live on this block.
Carl's my son.
Oh.
Well, uh, in that case, Mr., uh Dozier.
Fred Dozier.
Hmm.
I got it, I know what to do.
Mr. Dozier, we're looking for your son because we want to talk to him about, um Uh Uh About an opportunity, sir.
A great opportunity to, to, uh An opportunity to, uh Mr. Dozier, we need your help proving your son is a no-good criminal.
Nice move.
Thank you.
Come on in.
That's what I'm talking about.
Carl is my only child.
That knucklehead has never lived up to his potential.
Now what'd he do this time?
Well, we were kind of hoping you could help us figure that out.
When's the last time you saw him?
I don't know.
I told him I couldn't carry him anymore so I kicked him out about a month ago.
That's right before the Stop 'N Gulp robbery.
Mmm-hmm.
Mr. Dozier, do you have any recent pictures of your son?
I have this one.
Oh, that's nice, mind if we held on to that for I'd like to keep it, if you don't mind.
I understand.
That don't look nothing like me.
Well, I mean, it's not like looking in a mirror, no.
No.
No.
I got waves in my head, his hair nappy.
All right?
I got one chin, he got three.
Look, I got a big head but look how big his head is.
Yeah, he looks like the guy from The Blind Side.
If there's anything you guys can do to help him out, I'd I'd appreciate it.
He's a good kid at heart.
And I'd do anything to keep him out of jail.
I've had a vision.
I know who is responsible for the restaurant robbery that Thane Woodson was framed for.
It is this man and his name is Carl Dozier.
How did you know that?
O'Hara figured it out.
She's been burning the midnight oil.
I was already looking in to some of Derrick Poole's workers and I had narrowed it down to Carl, and a few others.
There was also a tiny droplet of blood found on a piece of clothing stuck on the barbed wire fence surrounding the jewelry store.
Oh, wait, I'm not supposed to be talking to you.
Once we run a full DNA analysis of the blood, we'll have scientific proof who the burglar is.
I have a great idea.
Hmm?
Jules, let's work together on this thing.
For Thane.
It'll be just like the old days.
The sweet days.
But what about the wall separating work and personal?
Oh, it's still there.
Rock solid.
We're just going to put in a little baby window.
Hmm.
Nice try.
Man Oh, don't forget to TiVo The Voice.
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Dude, seriously, where have you been?
Man, you know I had to finish my route.
You still have that job?
Look, Jules is very close to solving this case.
If she does that, that means we won't get our money.
We need to get that restaurant owner to come in and look at the new lineup.
Hey, Mercer!
Mercer!
Come on, man.
Mercer, we have a few more questions about Thane's case.
This is the security camera footage from the DVR.
No way.
No, Thane, no.
Well, maybe this is his way of saying thank you for trying to clear his good name.
Let's bring him in.
Man, I can't believe I'm back in jail.
The days are already beginning to blur together.
You've been in here for three hours.
Oh, excellent timing, fellows.
I just finished processing your client, who I always thought was guilty, by the way, on murder charges.
Look, man, you got that all wrong.
I went down there to ask Mercer for my job back because he said I was the best cook he ever had and then I found the dead body and a brother just panicked.
It was like déjà vu.
Man, Thane, if you had seen the video that we saw, you'd have been like, "Damn, that dude is guilty".
You know that's right.
What?
Man, you guys are supposed to believe me.
And you're supposed to not get arrested for killing someone.
Talk about what people are supposed to do This guy.
And what they're not supposed to do.
He has a very good point.
You're killing me, Thane.
You're free to go.
Man, we never doubted you.
My man!
My man!
No!
Thanks, Jerry.
It's nice to know that somebody still believes in me.
Uh, note, we going to sue the state for these last three hours as well.
That means our cut's three bucks.
No, he's not he's not going to sue the state.
Actually the person you should be thanking is Detective O'Hara.
She's the one that found evidence absolving you of this murder and had the charges dropped.
O'Hara, what's going on?
I canvassed the area for witnesses a second time and I found someone who will testify that they saw somebody else leaving the restaurant an hour before Thane got there.
Which is right in line with the coroner's estimated time of death.
Man, how many get out of jail free cards does a guy get?
Two.
Duh.
One in chance and one in community chest.
Carl undoubtedly knew that we were onto him and that we were talking to Mercer Lawrence.
So he killed Mercer to cover his tracks.
And Detective O'Hara also found DNA evidence which we hope will lead us to identifying the culprit in all these crimes and get you your restitution from the state.
Police lady, you done right by me.
Well, I was horrified at the thought of making the same mistake twice.
I should have let you help a brother out when you offered.
I misjudged you.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Oh, we're hugging.
Great.
That's beautiful.
That's love.
All right.
It's his thing.
Yeah.
Y'all fired.
What?
Oh, hell, nah!
No!
Thane, come on!
You're not still upset about the whole "we think you're guilty" thing, are you?
Wow.
Guys, that must really hurt.
At least something good came out of this.
I don't know what happened.
First I made Jules mad, then I made Thane lose faith, which cost us our fee, which made Gus cry, which is not that out of the ordinary.
Once again you find yourself stuck in the middle, Shawn, because you don't want to take a side.
But once you do, remember this, love lasts, money doesn't.
Oh, come on, man, go suck up to Juliet.
You may never find a gal this good again.
I know.
But it was ten "G" s. Huh?
$10,000.
Are you kidding?
Tax-free, I think.
Okay, scratch what I just said, go buy Juliet a broach.
Broach?
A tennis bracelet, a corsage, what Get off the couch, go make up with Thane.
You just said, "Love lasts".
You know, it lasts a lot longer when you got money in the bank.
Trust me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let me handle this, okay?
I'm gonna sweet talk him into hiring us back and I'm gonna do it southern style.
Please tell the lab we really need the DNA results and the droplet of blood from the crime scene.
Yeah, all right.
I'll hold.
Hey, Thane.
Oh, come on now, Thane.
Don't y'all be like that.
Y'all know me and Gus is still on your side.
We never left you.
Y'all are an idiot.
Shh!
Is that what I sound like to you?
Uncle Remus?
Hmm?
Well, y'alls can keep y'all's apology.
Great.
Now you've offended the man.
There's a backup at the lab.
We won't be able to get the DNA results for a bit.
Damn.
That means we still have some time.
No worries.
We'll just keep moving things on our end.
My gut tells me that Carl's going to have to get rid of these diamonds in a hurry, and based on the store's inventory, I'd say they're going to move pretty quick.
They're all mid-quality, I color, S.I. Clarity.
I don't know what any of this diamond talk means, but it's a little scary that she does.
S.I. Means the diamond has slight inclusions or flaws on the inside.
Ooh!
I'm I'm getting something.
These diamonds are full of love.
They didn't have any beef with anybody.
They're conflict free.
Whatever that means.
That means they don't come from any war-torn regions.
And every conflict free diamond has a unique laser-etched I.D. On it.
Which means that if we can find the diamonds, we can then trace them back to Carl.
That's a good lead.
Handle it.
I'll notify all local pawn shops and diamond brokers about which unique I.D. S to be on the lookout for.
Hopefully we'll get a hit.
Then we track records from the pawn shop to get an address for the person who fenced it.
Good work, Shawn.
Thank you, Jules.
I think it's pretty clear that we work better together.
What do you say we make a truce?
What about your money?
Yeah, we've got to get our priorities straight.
This was never about the money.
Ow!
I'm not going to say that to her.
Well, I must admit, Shawn, you showed up and showed out on that one.
That is because we are still committed to your case, Thane, and we are committed to you, man.
Hopefully this makes up for us doubting you earlier.
And if it does, maybe, you know, you'll hire us back or something.
Y'all ain't said nothing but a word.
All right!
Come on.
All right.
Back in the saddle!
Does that mean he hired us back?
I don't know.
Jasmine Richards?
Yes?
I'm Detective O'Hara, we'd like to ask you a few questions about the diamonds that you pawned at E. Z. Pawn and Title.
May we please come in?
Thank you.
Before we begin, Miss Richards, is anyone else in the apartment with you?
I live alone.
And as far as the diamonds go, they were a gift from my lousy ex.
Carl Dozier?
Yes.
He brought them by, trying to win me back but I said, "Hell, no," and I threw him out.
But you kept the diamonds.
They're not the ones who slept with my sister.
And you say that you kicked him out?
I haven't seen him since.
Okay.
Well, listen, thank you for your time.
If Carl comes back, could you give us a call?
I'm going to write my number down Sorry.
I misplaced my pen.
Do you have one I could borrow?
I think so.
Super duper.
I'm just gonna write my direct line on the back of this, you can call me anytime, Stop right there!
Carl Dozier, you're under arrest.
Hey, Jules, what's up?
Hey, Shawn.
Great news, we got Carl.
Yeah, he's been a slippery one, but we finally got him.
I'll fill you in as soon as we get Carl!
Hey.
Hey!
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
No!
Carl!
Ow!
I can't believe I let Carl get away.
Jules, hey, hey, hey.
I came as soon as I heard!
You okay?
I'm okay.
Oh, oh, your fingers.
I'm okay too, Spencer.
Thanks for asking.
Hey, did you just hear that?
It's almost as if Lassie's ghost thinks he's sitting here among us, and doesn't realize that he perished in that car crash.
Wow.
His spirit won't be able to rest until we help him tie up a loose end.
That's not funny, guys, seriously.
Shawn!
Yeah?
I'm I'm okay.
Okay.
But here's some good news.
The DNA found in the jewelry store is a match to blood droplets found in the back of O'Hara's car.
Which means that it has to be Carl's.
Henry's checking to see if there's a match on CODIS.
Superman's home planet.
Man, you know that's Krypton.
It's the national DNA database.
Guys, guys, we got a match.
But get this, it's tied to a crime committed in 1981.
eight years old.
That means Carl's just like Benjamin Button.
What?
That makes no sense at all, Shawn.
It most likely belongs to an immediate family member.
There's a 99 percent certainty that it's a familial match.
Carl's my only child.
That knucklehead.
He's never lived up to his potential.
Whoa.
I'm I'm sensing that even though Carl's the one committing the crimes, it's his father Fred Dozier that's been keeping us from finding him.
Why would he do that?
They didn't seem close at all.
No, they're not, but he's been covering for Carl this whole time in order to keep him out of the national DNA database.
Because Fred knew that if Carl was ever convicted, Carl would have to submit a mandatory DNA sample.
And that sample would be a familial match to DNA evidence that Fred must have left at a murder scene 30 years ago!
Whoa, I should probably see a doctor.
Mr. Dozier, we need your help to prove that your son is a no-good criminal.
Come on in.
Fred was cooperative with us so as not to raise our suspicions, but he must have found out Mercer Lawrence was assisting the police with a new investigation so he silenced that chef For good.
Here's the case file from 1981.
It says that the victim was a woman in her early 20s.
She was found at the docks.
There was no other physical evidence.
I am sensing that Fred Dozier worked for Seacoast Bottling back in the day.
Which is at the docks.
Well, let's start there.
Start at the docks.
I'm going to turn this on.
Freeze!
Put the gun down, Fred.
No one needs to get hurt!
Leave us alone!
He didn't do it!
Yeah, but you did, Fred!
We know everything!
Cops searched your bank records, found the $5,000 payment you made to Mercer Lawrence three years ago!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Man, you sure do!
You couldn't afford for Carl to get convicted in that restaurant robbery so you paid off the eyewitness to finger Thane as the culprit and then you planted the gun in Thane's car.
Shut up!
All to cover up a murder that you committed in your own knuckleheaded youth.
Like father, like son.
This is all to cover up a murder that you committed?
Just shut your mouth.
All this time I'm thinking that you're doing this to make sure they wouldn't take me from you.
Why you didn't tell me, Dad?
I'm not going to jail because of you.
I'm not no murderer, man.
I'm turning myself in.
Don't shoot him, Lassie.
He's unarmed!
He's just a kid.
He's unarmed, Lassie.
Come with me, Carl.
You did the right thing.
Turn around!
Hands behind your head!
Well, because of us, Thane got his restitution.
And we get our $10,000.
Yeah, I'm glad he finally got justice after being wrongly convicted.
That's one of the many great things about you, Jules.
Throughout this whole process, you never got caught up in petty competitiveness.
Oh, I so wanted to beat you guys.
Whoo!
Whoa.
Yes, what y'all think, huh?
Nice ride.
Looks good on you.
Thank you.
Yeah, just a little gift I got myself.
I'm going to take the rest of the settlement money and I'm going to reopen Mercer's restaurant.
Oh, good for you, man.
Oh.
You finally realized your dream of having your own place.
Oh, well, you know, too bad I had to spend two years and eight months in prison first.
It would have taken you longer to get the restaurant if you hadn't gone to jail.
Yeah.
I'm just saying.
But you know, I just came to say goodbye to you guys.
Detective O'Hara, you give cops a good name.
I find no fault in you.
Oh, thanks, Thane.
I'm glad you finally got justice.
Thank you.
Hey, come on.
Give it up, Shawn.
There it is.
All right.
Gus, come on, give it to me.
All right.
Oh, come on, Detective, there you go.
There you go.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay.
Yeah.
You smell like vanilla.
Yeah, it's time.
Okay.
Mmm.
All right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, Shawn, Gus, Lord willing and the creek don't rise, hope to see you in my restaurant soon.
Oh, you can count on that.
You have to It's on the other side of town.
The creek does rise.
Yeah.
It's nowhere near your place so that We're good.
Did he just run a stop sign?
Yes, he did, but he also spent almost three years in jail for a crime he didn't commit.
I think we can give him a freebie.
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
Okay, that was a red light.
Come on, Jules.
Did he give you the check?
I thought he gave you the check.
No.
Oh, we got to go after this dude.
Yeah.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Uncle Lou.
There's my man.
Shawn, I've got a new one for you.
What do polar bears get from sitting on the ice too long?
Polaroids.
Lou, I don't know what that means, but I know it's funny.
That's funny.
What's going on, Dad?
Oh, uh, nothing.
Just work stuff.
Can you tell me about it?
Maybe when you're a little older.
Come on.
I'm old enough to drive.
I think I can handle hearing about one of your cases.
Shawn, you're not going to be able to drive for three years.
Really?
Then how will Gus and I get to Vegas this weekend?
Come on, Henry.
He can handle it.
Fine, but I'm calling you when he can't sleep tonight.
We're looking for a missing girl.
What's her name?
Veronica Towne.
Where was she last seen?
This bar where she waitresses called The Blue Derby.
What was she wearing?
Why does that matter?
A red dress and a gold necklace with her initials on it.
Thanks, Lou.
So, do you think she was murdered?
It's starting to look that way.
Uh, who do you think did it?
A guy by the name of Jordan Beaumont, her boss at The Blue Derby.
We can't prove it until we find the place where he stashed the body.
Or places.
Gotcha.
You're not going to be able to sleep tonight, are you?
Not a wink.
Thanks, Lou.
So?
It's been a while since you've given me an update on you and Jules.
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.
We're doing great.
And can I tell you why?
Why?
We're done stressing about whether we're moving in together.
Or getting married.
We both know that's not happening until way down the line.
I hear that.
After retirement and menopause.
Now we can just relax and enjoy each other.
Oh, and we found this amazing book called the Kama-sutra.
What?
The illustrations are illuminating.
There's one called congress of the rhino.
Shawn.
I've never been so happy to see a dead person in my life.
Jules, what have we got?
Unidentified male.
Found dead, gunshot wound to the face.
Ouch.
Who's the big scary guy?
Carlton Lassiter.
You should know that by now.
Uh, he's the foreman on the construction site.
He's the one who found the body.
I've got to tell you, Mister Montero, your story, much like your lunch box, smells a little fishy.
You dig in over here, you find a body way over there.
How did that happen?
I had to take a leak.
So after you found the body, then what did you do?
I really had to take a leak.
We're going to need to interview the rest of your crew.
Stop!
Stop!
What are you doing?
I'm sensing there's something in there.
What is it, Shawn?
What the hell?
What was she wearing?
A red dress and a gold necklace with her initials on it.
I'm so not sleeping tonight.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end There she is.
That's her, that's her.
Step aside, please.
Chief Vick, is there any truth to the rumors that one of the bodies found yesterday belongs to Veronica Towne?
I have no comment on that at this time.
Has anyone in her family been contacted?
I will pass along all info as it becomes available.
Thank you.
When can we expect a statement, Chief Vick?
Chief Vick!
We don't have an ID on this fellow yet.
But I believe his time of death was approximately 6:00 p.m. On the day in question.
Now as for this one, Shawn's hunch about it being Veronica Towne was spot on.
She was quite a looker.
Still is.
Anyway, all the records match.
Her shoes and dress, however, not so much.
Sorry, sorry, I can be a real bitch sometimes.
How did she die?
Well, my first guess was smallpox.
But it turns out she had none of the symptoms, plus smallpox apparently was eradicated about 40 years ago.
Who knew?
Not me.
Not me.
But based on the fracture to her neck, I'm going to say she was strangled to death.
Jordan Beaumont did this.
Who's Jordan Beaumont?
Her boss at the bar she worked at, The Blue Derby.
That's right, Shawn.
He was also her boyfriend and a real SOB.
He was seen pushing her around in a parking lot a couple of hours before she vanished.
How do you know so much about this case?
Because I was the lead detective along with my partner at the time, Lou Gamble.
May he rest in peace.
Sweet, old Uncle Lou had a thousand jokes about hemorrhoids.
They were all hilarious.
Jordan was our lead suspect the entire time.
So why couldn't you get him?
We never got enough evidence.
So why couldn't you get him?
Beaumont?
Why do I know that name?
Because his father Ellis is one of the most successful and powerful businessmen in all of Santa Barbara.
You mean he was.
We just got an ID on this body.
So now I've got two bodies.
A girl who's been missing for 20 years, and the father of the man long suspected of killing her.
Do you have any other bombshells for me?
Did you see the finale of The Bachelorette?
Yes.
Then no, I do not.
Our theory is that Jordan Beaumont killed Veronica Towne 20 years ago and recently offed his father and dumped his body in the same spot.
Why would Jordan bury one body and not the other?
Maybe it was some weird admission of guilt.
Ah, kind of like Gus admitting that he likes cat food.
I said I like how it looks in commercials.
There's a difference.
No, there is not a difference.
I want Jordan tracked down and questioned immediately.
Shawn and Gus, you're on this as well.
Karen, what should I do?
I'd like you to serve in your usual role.
You know, crosswords, air bombing the men's room.
I think I should also work the case.
As what, a detective?
Nobody knows it better than I do.
You could reinstate me this one time.
Come on, Henry.
With all due respect, you can't just hop back in the game after all these years.
There's been a lot of changes on the job.
Lassie's right.
For example, the bicycle is no longer just one giant wheel with a tiny one in back.
And now my people can vote.
Karen, I promise you I can handle this thing.
Plus, I owe it to Lou Gamble to solve this case.
Come on.
Let me finish what I started.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Excuse me.
Okay, Chief, I don't think you're thinking this all the way through.
I'm going to head over to Jordan's house.
I think he still lives at his parents' estate.
You two should go to the club he owns on 26th street.
Okay, so do we go with your dad or with Lassie?
Worst options ever.
Will you relax?
You act like this is the first time you ever worked with your dad.
How about you relax, huh?
How about that?
I am relaxed.
It's usually from a distance, man.
I'm having flashbacks to the time he chaperoned our eighth grade field trip.
Ooh, I remember that.
He kept undoing his pants and tucking in his shirt.
It was horrifying.
Now he's 20 years weirder and this time he's carrying a gun.
Detective Spencer.
Been a while.
So, where's Lou?
He died of a heart attack four years ago.
Shocking.
He took such good care of himself.
Hey, hey, easy, easy Sipowicz.
I'm Gentlemen, the timing of your visit is not ideal.
As you may know, my client's father has just passed away.
And he has arrangements to make.
Like what?
Like renovating the giant house you just inherited?
What's your point?
What do you think it is?
Well, you clearly think that I killed my father.
Oh, yeah?
Actually, I forgot what my point was, but what you just said makes a lot of sense.
Excuse me.
Who are you?
Shawn Spencer.
That is my partner, Sh'Dynasty.
It is spelled "S-H," comma to the top, Dynasty.
Comma to the top?
That's God's comma.
And I am a bad-ass psychic detective Jack Fon Swoo.
He's also my son.
Dad.
You took the teeth right out of my bad-ass comment.
I'd be very careful how you tread here, gentlemen.
We will not stand for further libelous accusations like the ones related to Veronica Towne.
Oh, you mean the woman we found dead 30 yards from his father?
Yeah, that's right.
You got anything to say about that, smart-ass?
Small world.
For the record, I was at my girlfriend Thea's all last night.
Oh, that's nice, that's sweet.
Do you have an address for this Thea?
Gentlemen, my client is under no obligation to answer any questions from you.
Now I'll have to ask that you leave.
Immediately.
Take it easy, Kat Von D. Know this, Jordan.
I'm on to you.
Like fat on a fat person.
Please.
You're not going to find anything on me, Shawn.
What makes you so sure?
Because the apple does not fall far from the tree.
Gentlemen.
Man.
I want to punch that smarmy bastard and then laugh in his handsome, ethnically neutral face.
No one wants to nail this guy's ass more than I do.
Sorry, I'm a little rusty on my cop talk.
What are we doing here, anyway, Shawn?
Looking for Room 207.
That was the number on his valet ticket dated Saturday night.
See, it wasn't his girlfriend Thea's.
Unless, of course, Thea lives here.
May I help you?
Thea Summers?
We need to ask you a few questions about Jordan Beaumont.
Fun.
I love boy talk.
Jordan definitely has a type.
Yes, he does.
Feel free to help yourself to the minibar.
I've been waiting my entire life to hear those exact words.
Ooh, I'm glad I quit that stupid cleanse today.
So, Thea, you've been here a while.
About three weeks.
Nice place.
I guess.
If you like green.
Dude!
Have some respect for yourself.
Suck it, Shawn.
So I guess dating Jordan has its perks, huh?
I'd say we're more seeing each other.
I save the "D" word for guys I'm sleeping with.
Really?
No whoopee?
No hanky-panky in the nighty-night?
No dark dancing?
So, what does a guy get for putting you up in a place like this?
A step closer to sleeping with me.
Dad, what are you doing?
I just gotta quickly tuck in my shirt.
That is easily accomplished without unbuttoning your pants.
This is my field trip all over again.
Do you mind if I step outside for a cigarette?
Of course not, go ahead.
Just I can tell you're not a fan of working with your father.
How did you know he was my You have the same eyes.
Don't worry, I'm no stranger to daddy issues.
That photo in your bag suggests otherwise.
It was a happier time.
Have you always been such a snoop?
Oh, yeah, hence my nickname in high school.
Snoopy?
Hammertime.
Where'd you live before the Beaumont?
Michigan.
Moved to Santa Barbara three weeks ago to get away from the cold.
I planned on staying a night, but then I met Jordan.
Then he started comping me.
When was the last time you saw him?
Last night.
We stayed in and watched Summer School.
Pretty lame, right?
Yeah, if you hate cinematic perfection.
Ski School was on before that.
You guys watch Ski School?
No.
Jordan arrived just as Summer School was starting.
Hello, everyone.
It's great to be back.
Enjoy your stay.
Chief, I would very much like to elbow him in the sternum.
Please do.
Estimated time of death for Ellis Beaumont is 6:00 p.m. Jordan arrived at the hotel just as Summer School was starting at nine, which is true because I was watching, too.
Nobody paints a scene like Dean Cameron.
He's a chainsaw, right?
That's right, Chief.
So that leaves a three-hour gap in his alibi.
Well, it's thin, but it's enough to hold him for questioning.
What is up with Mister Guster?
Sugar crash.
He just ate $600 worth of candy from the hotel minibar.
Oh.
Shawn, I've been looking all over for you.
Now, listen, we found another person's DNA on Veronica Towne.
We ran some tests.
We have a match.
Great.
Let me guess.
Jordan Beaumont.
No, the name that came up was Lou Gamble.
What?
Let me see that.
Uncle Lou?
There's no way that Lou Gamble had anything to do with Veronica Towne's death.
What was his DNA doing all over her body?
I don't know.
Maybe it was a mix-up in the lab.
Somebody tried to set him up.
It doesn't matter.
Lou was a great cop and he was as decent a guy as you'll find.
He certainly didn't seem like the murdering type.
Then again, neither did Matthew McConaughey's character in The Lincoln Lawyer.
Ryan Phillipe was the murderer in that movie.
Really?
I never saw it.
Henry Spencer.
I don't believe it.
Ah!
It's great to see you, Bea.
Hey, you remember my son, Shawn, don't you?
Of course.
Hi, Bea.
Last time I saw you, you were practically in tears because your dad wouldn't buy you an ice cream.
When was that, Henry?
Six years ago.
These were the best years of Lou's life, working with you, Jack and Jerry.
Yeah, well, we were quite a team.
You know, back in those days honor and respect for the badge meant something.
Worst boy band ever.
Do you all still keep in touch?
Occasionally.
Jack still lives in town.
Jerry has a place up north.
I'm the only one who hasn't retired.
He means physically.
Mentally, it's nap time, Bea.
Excuse me, do you mind if I have some of this candy?
Of course, dear.
Thank you.
You have a problem, candy man.
I make the world taste good.
Bea, back in '91, do you remember hearing Jack talk about a case involving the name Veronica Towne?
No, he rarely talked to me about any of his cases.
Do you remember anything strange about his behavior at the time?
Please, this is important.
Well, let's see.
'91.
Well, there were the calls.
What calls?
I'll be right back.
Are you kidding me?
You just crashed at the police station.
Players don't crash, Shawn.
They rest their eyes and then they refuel.
Burton.
For about a week, I would get these calls when I was alone from a man with a deep, raspy voice.
He'd say things like, "How's your day going, Bea"?
Then hang up.
I didn't really start to get scared until these showed up.
These were waiting for me on my car windshield one afternoon.
Did Lou ever see these?
Yes, but he just said to ignore them and then he placed the photos in the trash.
I immediately fished them out and kept them, just to be safe.
What happened after that?
Nothing.
No more calls, photos, but Lou's behavior did strike me as a bit strange.
But then I just assumed it was because of the stress of working two jobs.
Two jobs?
What do you mean?
He was too proud to tell you.
I had some medical issues at the time, so he picked up an off-duty security job to help pay the bills.
Do you remember where?
Yes, The Blue Derby.
I came here twice to interview the staff after Veronica's disappearance.
Both times, Lou called in sick.
He was definitely hiding something.
What is this place?
Well, back then, it was one those piano bars complete with red booths and waitresses in skimpy outfits.
I can see times have changed.
Detective Spencer, right?
Ida Lane.
I thought you would've found a different line of work by now.
I was about to say the same thing to you.
This is my son, Shawn and his partner, Gus.
Hello.
Nice.
I voted against Prop 8.
Uh, we're partners in a detective agency.
Oh.
But we're also lovers in the nighttime.
Would you stop it?
We're like The Insiders, but even more gay.
The Insiders were not gay.
And neither are we.
Ida, we found Veronica Towne's body yesterday.
Does that upset you?
Why would it?
I wasn't her biggest fan.
And why was that?
She was a terrible waitress who did whatever she wanted because she was sleeping with Jordan.
She disappeared once for six months and then showed back up and got her job back just like that.
You and I talked back when Veronica disappeared.
You said that she seemed upset.
Yes, she was crying hysterically.
And saying over and over, "I will not do this alone".
Or something like that.
You recognize this man?
His name was Lou Gamble.
He used to work security back then.
All the security guys stayed in the parking lot.
I never met any of them.
Security guys?
Like, plural?
What, was this place jamming back in the day?
Hardly.
I don't think this crowd, or anything, for that matter, has changed since the 50s.
That's interesting.
Would you mind if we took a peek in your kitchen?
Sure, but it hasn't been operational since Ellis sold the place.
You mean Jordan.
Jordan was just the front man.
His father never let him have ownership of anything.
Hmm.
Excuse us.
Dude, why would Ellis Beaumont be interested in a dive like this?
And what would he possibly need security for?
I don't know, but I'm not mad at Ida.
Something about older women in inappropriate outfits keeping it nice and tight.
Gus, she's old enough to be your mother's younger, sexier, something.
I get it.
See.
That's weird.
There's no oven in here, just a bunch of burners.
What's sodium bicarbonate?
Baking soda.
Bacon soda?
Yeah.
That's a genius idea, Gus, but I'm not sure the world is ready for a pork-flavored beverage.
I disagree, but that's not what I said.
Baking soda.
Baking.
That's what sodium bicarbonate is.
What the hell were they making here?
Crack?
Look, the Beaumonts owned the place at the exact time that the drug was running rampant everywhere.
I think his sense is right.
There was enough stuff in the kitchen to mix the drug on a big scale.
Ellis Beaumont was pushing drugs?
Well, he definitely wasn't making his money from cooking food.
You know that's right.
How did the department not know about this?
Because he had protection from one of our own.
My ex-partner, Lou Gamble.
Well, this gets better and better.
Lassiter, let's track down Jordan ASAP.
Track him down?
Isn't he here?
His lawyer arranged his release a half hour ago.
We didn't have enough to hold him.
I'll bring him back in, dead or alive.
Alive.
Fine, didn't say anything about conscious.
- Hello?
- How's your day, Shawn?
I'm sorry, what was that?
Stay away from the Towne case.
That's a warning.
Who is this?
Is this Jordan?
Hello?
Hey, it's the Woodmaster.
You're going to want to get down here.
So, I've been doing some more work on Veronica here and two interesting things came up.
One, I believe she went to Virginia Tech.
Notice the "V-T" on her necklace.
Which stands for Veronica Towne.
Scratch that.
Second thing, this is the bombshell, she had recently given birth.
Are you sure?
The lab confirmed it.
She disappeared once for six months and then showed back up and got her job back just like that.
Well, the plot, unlike your hair, continues to thicken.
Here's what I think.
I think Jordan knocked up Veronica, sent her off to have the kid in secret.
She came back to The Blue Derby, flips out when she realizes Jordan has no interest in being a father.
She was crying hysterically and saying over and over, "I will not do this alone".
Or something like that.
So she approaches him.
She demands that he give more, whether that mean time or money or both.
He freaks out, he chokes her.
I imagine that he had Lou dispose of the body.
That is one heartless-ass dude.
You need to tell your dad about this.
Let's not and say we did.
Come on, Shawn.
He can't be that annoying.
Man, the one thing I've never doubted about my father is that he was a great cop.
It just bums me out that now I have to question that, too.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
Let's see.
He was lead on the case, he didn't know that Veronica was pregnant, he didn't know The Blue Derby was a crack den.
He didn't even know his own partner was on the take.
Cut the man some slack, Shawn.
Santa Barbara has changed a lot since then.
There was a lot of underhanded, shady stuff going on.
Places don't change, Gus.
Stop making excuses for him.
Jules.
Oh, God.
Hello?
Mmm!
Gus, what are you doing here?
Mmm Sorry, I had a mouthful of M&Ms. Shawn gave me his keys.
He said to wait until you got back.
He was worried about you.
Worried?
Why?
And I was saving those M&Ms to make brownies.
Jules!
Ah, thank God.
Why aren't you answering your phone?
I was on a run on my break.
What is going on?
Okay.
First things first, when were you thinking about putting on those brownies?
Someone, clearly trying to intimidate me into dropping this case.
We found these on Gus' car.
Someone's following me?
Yes.
I'm pretty sure it's Jordan.
He's been completely off the map since he was released.
Listen, you can't just drop out of contact like that.
Shawn, relax.
I'm okay.
Excuse me.
I think I'm going to stick around here for a while.
At least until we solve this thing.
Thank you, but I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself.
Just let me.
Please.
Okay.
Hello?
Gus, is Juliet okay?
Yeah, she's fine.
Aren't you curious how I am?
Not really.
Now listen, tell Shawn that Lassiter has set up a trace on his cell phone so we can nail down the location of this caller.
Okay.
Wait, one more thing.
I've been doing a little digging on Jordan.
Get this, turns out he was married for a year back in '97.
To who?
So where's your father?
Don't worry, Ida.
He's on his way.
Why didn't you tell us you were married to Jordan?
Never came up.
Besides, it's not something I like to talk about.
It was probably the most depressing time in my life.
That says a lot.
Why did it end, exactly?
I wanted children.
And he didn't?
Let's just say they weren't in the cards for him.
Meaning what?
His juice had no pulp.
Huh?
His seed wasn't fruitful.
A farmer He wasn't He was pouring decaf.
Pumping unleaded?
Gas, I His Hall had no Oates.
Um.
He was sterile!
Oh!
Oh, sure.
Hall.
Oates.
That makes total sense.
Exactly.
Whatever.
She doesn't speak Spanish.
Will you excuse us for just one moment?
Please.
Gladly.
Holy crap, Gus.
That means Jordan couldn't have been the one that knocked up Veronica.
Does that mean he didn't kill her?
Not necessarily.
We've got to figure out who the real father was.
And how do we do that?
I've got something.
Thank you for meeting with us, Doctor.
Oh, of course.
One of my true pleasures in life is getting to meet the people I helped bring into this world.
Plus, uh, Stevie here made enough fish to feed the entire Cambodian air force.
Oh, don't worry.
He doesn't speak a lick of English.
Actually, I do.
Huh, look at that!
You are full of surprises, Stevie.
Oh Ah.
Confession, Doctor.
You actually didn't deliver me.
Oh.
No, sir.
That honor went to a cabbie named Jugdish.
I know what you're thinking, but it wasn't even an emergency labor.
Hmm.
Jugdish just brought my mother great comfort.
Back in India, he was a doctor of musicology.
But you did deliver the child of a woman we once knew.
Oh, really?
Who was that?
Veronica Towne.
What exactly are you boys after?
The truth would be nice.
Or some Mallomars.
We're not settling for Mallomars.
I didn't say we were settling.
I see.
The truth is heavy.
Therefore, few care to carry it.
Winston Churchill said that.
Look, Doctor, I don't care if the former Prime Minister of England said it.
What I know is that Veronica Towne's body was recently discovered with your business card on it.
clinic I had on the outside of town.
The entire delivery ran three hours.
She had a girl.
We would like to know who the father was.
That I cannot tell you.
She didn't tell me, nor did I care.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll finish this inside.
But I'll advise you boys to watch your step.
The past can be treacherous.
Can you at least tell us the girl's name?
Yes.
Dahlia.
Dahlia Towne.
Dude, there are no listings for Dahlia Towne anywhere.
We need to check the birth records and the adoption records.
Dude, I am tired.
Now get your stuff and go be with Juliet.
We'll do it in the morning.
The morning may be too late, Gus.
I'm not going to mess up this investigation like my dad did.
Man, you need to work out your daddy issues on your own time.
Now I'm about to go home and have a threesome with two Toblerones and then hit the sack.
Suck it.
You suck it.
Suck it See you in the morning.
All right, man.
All right, who's there?
Jordan?
Nice night for a walk.
All right, listen.
I've got six bucks and a picture of Mary Stuart Masterson in my wallet.
It's all yours!
Find another case.
This is your last warning.
Hello, Thea.
Going somewhere?
What happened to your eye?
When I don't sleep I get a dark circle under one eye.
Where's Jordan?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know what?
Do us a favor and cut the crap.
His car is parked out back.
Really?
Hello, kitty cat.
Oh, ow!
What the hell?
Now we're even.
For what?
For this!
And for threatening my girlfriend.
What?
No, I never did any of those things.
I Look, I am innocent.
Then why were you hiding?
Because my lawyer told me to stay out of sight.
He was worried there was going to be a media circus.
Oh, please.
You must think we're complete idiots.
I know it's you who's been calling me.
Hello?
You should have taken my advice, Shawn.
Hey, look, man, I'm sorry about your eye, okay?
Oh.
Hello?
Spencer, listen, we traced that phone call.
It came from the corner of 26th and Holland.
That's two blocks from you.
Put some ice on that.
Worst boy band ever.
Jack!
Look out.
Who are we chasing?
Jack Atwater, detective who used to work with my dad!
How old is he?
At least 70.
Then why can't we catch him?
I don't know!
I don't eat well and I don't exercise, what's your excuse?
I don't do well at high altitudes.
What are you talking about?
You know, like Denver.
We're not in Denver.
Just run, Shawn!
It's over, Jack.
Oh.
Back in '91, I was approached by Ellis Beaumont.
He offered me 50 grand to play lookout for the drug business he was running out of The Blue Derby.
I had two kids in school, so I bit.
Then he said he needed one more, so I brought in Lou, who was hesitant at first.
But, you know, Bea had been sick.
You took an oath, Jack.
Please spare me that Boy Scout crap, Henry.
Not all of us could be model cops like you.
No wonder I could never get a leg up on the investigation.
I'll give you this, you weren't an easy guy to throw off.
What happened next?
Things were fine until one day Ellis called and said there had been an accident with one of the waitresses.
Veronica Towne.
Yeah, and he wanted help covering it up.
When we said no, he threatened to tip off the chief to what we were doing.
So you covered up her murder.
We had no choice.
The job was all we had.
You had a choice.
So, Lou disposed of the body and then a few weeks later he started to crack.
So you threatened him and his wife to make him shut up.
And you pulled the same move on my son after you killed Ellis Beaumont.
Yes, but I did not kill Beaumont.
I swear.
Yeah, well who in their right minds would believe that?
Me.
Let me go.
Jordan.
No, No.
You can't just leave.
Jordan, things will never work out between the two of us.
Believe me.
Why?
Because she's your sister.
What are you talking about?
You weren't the only one sleeping with Veronica Towne 20 years ago.
- Your dad was, too.
- And he got her pregnant and to hide it from you, he sent her away to have the child.
Her name is Dahlia.
What?
He said her name was Dahlia.
Your father's plan was to keep paying off Veronica, but she wanted more.
How dare you come to my house!
You cannot just abandon me!
I will not do this alone.
Don't threaten me!
Sensing that he could lose his marriage, he took action.
He had the officers on his payroll cover it up.
Then he arranged to have sweet, little Dahlia be adopted by a couple in Michigan.
Who then changed her name to Thea.
No, this is all insane.
No, it's not.
A year ago my parents told me that Veronica was my real mother I became obsessed with the case.
I vowed to find out who murdered her.
But you assumed it was Jordan based on the newspaper accounts, but something, something told you it was Ellis instead.
And I'd like to take a guess.
Sure.
You're doing well so far.
He was color-blind.
Just like you.
Nice place.
Yeah, I guess.
If you like green.
See, color-blindness is a genetic trait.
It's almost always passed from father to daughter.
Have you been reading my Scientific Weekly?
No.
My Men's Health quarterly?
You think we could do this later?
Stop reading my stuff, Shawn.
Armed with this knowledge, you confronted Ellis.
And you asked him point-blank if he was the one who killed Veronica.
And I am assuming he came clean.
With a little persuasion.
Come on.
Now!
I then told him to take me to the place where they left my mother.
Come on.
Show me where you put her.
Dahlia, come on.
Don't call me that.
Thea, you're my daughter.
And that's where you pulled the trigger.
I'm sorry, Jordan.
Rough day for you, man, no way around that.
The girl you're dating turns out to be your sister.
Who killed your father.
Who killed your mother.
And was sleeping with your ex-girlfriend.
And Shawn punched you in the face.
Yeah, there's that, too.
I'm sorry.
His girlfriend, his sister, his girlfriend, his sister.
Forget about it, Shawn.
It's just Santa Barbara.
Well, I guess I should swing by your place and pick up all my stuff now that you're okay.
Shawn, all you brought over were some clothes, a toothbrush, and your workout bricks.
Right.
All my stuff.
I'll have you know, those bricks built this man house.
Thank you.
What was that for?
I was just thinking about how worried you always are when you think I'm in danger.
Oh, Jules.
My single greatest fear used to be that something would happen to me.
My second greatest fear was that something would happen to Gus.
Clearly, all that has changed.
So, do me a favor and stop finding yourself in grave danger.
I will do my best.
You know what?
Why don't you stay at my place tonight?
Take your things home tomorrow.
Okay, that's cool.
Oh, wait Wait, tomorrow's Friday.
Oh, right.
Well, maybe you should stay the weekend.
Oh, that would be three consecutive days.
what's on the table.
Not even a vacation.
Nope.
Just you and me at my place.
All right.
But I'm going to need a drawer, though.
Well, then you're never going to want to leave.
Yo, Pop.
What's up?
I'm trying to convince your father to stay on as a detective just a little longer.
He hasn't missed a step.
Hear, hear.
No, my detective days are over.
So's my career in police work.
What?
Wait, you're retiring?
Effective immediately.
My resignation letter is already on your desk.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is this because I yelled at you for the pants thing?
Look, Dad, if you need to drop trou, you can drop trou.
No, no, it's just my heart's not in it anymore.
Henry, I think we should talk about this.
There's no need to, Karen.
It's time.
Well, let me know if you change your mind.
You're going to be missed.
Thanks for everything, Karen.
All right, how long have you been thinking about this?
Oh, not long.
The only reason I stuck around for so long was because of the respect I had for the job.
But now?
Nah.
Look, Dad, I I get it.
And I'm I'm really sorry.
But, you know, there are still a lot of damn good cops on the force and they go out there and put their lives on the line every day for the right reasons.
You're right.
Yeah, you're right.
It's just not my game anymore, kid.
What?
Your old police hat?
You remember I used to put this thing on as a kid and run all over the house bumping into stuff?
Dreaming that one day I'd be this amazing cop.
Just like my old man.
Yeah, well, I guess your, uh, perception of me has changed a little since then, huh?
Actually, it's quite the contrary.
What do you say you and I go out and grab a beer a little later?
A beer?
Yeah.
Well, that's not really your thing, is it?
Yeah, I know, maybe we can change that now that I have some time on my hands.
I'm not going to lie to you, cold beer sounds rich and delicious.
I think we should go now.
Let's go now.
First I've got to break some bad news to an old friend.
It's so much bigger than mine.
It's ridiculous.
It's yours, kid.
I'm sorry to be the one to break it to you, Jerry.
I just can't believe it.
The four of us were like brothers.
I guess we're the last of the good ones, huh?
Looks like retirement's been good to you.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
I told you, let me do your investing for you.
I know, I know, I know.
I still can't understand how they would do all of that just for money.
Well, 50 grand was a lot back then.
What'd you just say?
I never told you how much they were getting paid.
Shawn.
Hey, Buzz.
I forgot to pick up our check.
Did I hear the Towne-Beaumont case was wrapped up?
Yeah, it is.
Aw, jeez.
Someone should have told me.
I've been going through these old records for eight hours.
What for?
Off-duty work permits.
Chief Vick wanted a list of everyone who filed to work at The Blue Derby.
Sure.
This one was unmarked.
Someone was trying real hard to make sure it wasn't found.
Really?
Oh, my God.
It's not too late to do the right thing, Jerry.
I'm sorry, Henry.
