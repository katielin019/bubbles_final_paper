{START OF EPISODE 1}
We're gonna fly to screw each morning we're gonna smile the entire time we're gonna be more happy we're gonna finally be fine we're gonna get more calm and normal we're gonna fix our state of mind we're gonna be less crazy we're gonna finally be fine we're gonna stand holding hands in a brand new land far away from the borderline we're gonna seem like a mainstream dream and be appealing to all mankind we're gonna have more fun and be less weird than the first two years combined and we're gonna live forever and we're gonna sleep together and we're gonna finally be sunny and shinily we're gonna finally be fine Jeff.
Jeff?
Oh, sorry.
Uh, what was the question?
What are we gonna do without Pierce in the study group this year?
I'm sure we'll figure it out.
Speaking of figuring things out, me and Abed have an announcement.
Troy and I are living together.
- Oh, that's-- - Oh, that's nice.
If you want to get us a gift, we're registered at linens 'n things.
We have plenty of linens.
We mainly want the things.
How you like me now, bitches?
Dean, you seem different.
Are you in a play right now?
Over the summer, I decided it's time to whip this place into shape.
I'm gonna be a mean, lean, deaning machine.
No more paintball, no more spaceships, no more trampolines, and no more-- What is that?
It's probably the monkey that lives in the vents.
I named him "Annie's boobs," after Annie's boobs.
See, this is the kind of national lampoonery that is coming to an end this year.
Homie don't dean this.
Okay, guys, let's get to biology on time.
I don't want to be a screwup this year.
Uh, Britta.
Damn it.
We're really doing this without Pierce?
So sad.
Yeah, we have parted ways with our closest, oldest, craziest, most racist, oldest, elderly, crazy friend, and he's not coming back.
I'm back.
How was your summer?
Enlightful, Annie.
I underwent three months of intensive soul-rezoning at the laser lotus celebrity center.
I stand before you a more highly evolved Pierce Hawthorne, one that can accept that this table has a-- has a sort of magic in it.
Aww.
And I'd like to come back.
- Yeah.
- Damn it!
Oh, uh, sorry.
I just had the frustrating realization that you can't come back to the group, because you're not in biology and it's all filled up.
Well, couldn't we take something else?
I mean, surely we've evolved beyond caring what class we take together.
- Oh, yeah.
- Pierce!
I'll do you one better.
I think we've evolved beyond reliance on a group at all.
Aren't we just actual friends now, no matter where we are?
You know what's magic about this table?
It magically keeps our books from falling on the floor.
The table's for studying, but as friends, we've evolved.
And let's use that first breath of crisp, new, super evolved air to declare proudly and in one voice, "Pierce We'll see you when we see you".
Don't tell the monkey I'm living here.
Give me some rope, tie me to a tree give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away Oh, star-burns, I see you added a lizard to your special hat and sideburns.
Am I missing anything?
Yeah!
The human being underneath it all, but no one's really interested in that, are they?
No.
I hope we did the right thing about Pierce.
He really seems like he's changed.
What are you, nuts?
That's what he wants you to think.
Trust me, we're better off without him.
Excluding Pierce is what drove him crazy last year.
Wrong, being crazy drove him excluded.
What's wrong?
Cougar town has been moved to mid-season.
That's never a good sign.
Not cool, not cool, not cool, not cool, not cool-- Hey buddy, hey, it's coming back in January.
Six seasons and a movie.
Six seasons and a movie.
Oh.
This is Intro to Biology.
I'm your professor, Dr. Marshall King, PhD.
It took me 6,205 hours to get my degree, and I know, because I was only allowed in the library one hour per day at the San Vicente correctional facility while serving a sentence of 25 to life.
Now let's talk about that word.
"Life".
Sorry.
It's a new phone.
Switching to vibrate.
Continue.
This is really great.
I stared at a crack in the ground in my cell for years, and one day, something grew from it.
A single blade of grass.
Vibrates louder than the ringer.
Gosh.
You know what?
Turning it off.
Living thing, growing from dead stone.
Get out!
- Oh, it's off, it's off.
- Out!
I turned it off.
Fine.
Okay, fine.
I'm leaving.
And don't bother coming back.
Seriously?
Hey, dude, Sean Penn called.
He says to dial it back.
Sean Penn is an actor who-- I know who Sean Penn is.
I've seen Milk.
Now get out.
Dude, learn to blend.
I will not tolerate monkeys living on campus.
If I wanted to run a monkey hotel, I'd install a banana buffet.
I'd use vines as elevators, and I'd put tail holes in the bathrobes, and I'd lower all the shower knobs.
Wow, you've really thought this through.
And now it's your turn.
Brainstorm.
Idea shower.
Spray your solutions all over me.
Well, w-we could seal all the vents and then pump the ducts with some kind of gas that knocks out monkeys.
Monkey knockout gas!
Now that's the kind of grounded, sensible thinking I want to see this year.
Catherine, who's next?
Vice Dean Laybourne, from the air conditioning repair school annex.
Vice Dean.
Dean.
New suit, Dean?
New Dean, vice Dean.
New Dean.
I see that you used school funds to buy an espresso machine for your faculty break room.
I don't recall being consulted on that.
I don't consult you on anything.
That's the problem.
The air-conditioning repair school annex seems to think.
That it's separate from Greendale, but it's an annex.
An appendage, on a body, with a head, and this head is saying to this appendage, "whazup"?
What you say makes sense, Dean.
Tell you what.
You bring your head down to my appendage tomorrow, and I'll show you "whazup".
I'll be there.
I think I found something that will help Abed!
Abed, did you know that Cougar Town is an American adaptation of a 1990s British sitcom?
Cougarton abbey.
Just been 'round Cougarton chapel.
I may be having an awakening.
Come off it, Deidre.
You've only been having a butchers at the choir boys.
Better than nothing.
Thanks, Britta.
Can you believe that guy, kicking me out of class like that?
It's gonna be impossible to find a science class with six open spots.
Why would we need to do that?
Because I'm not in biology anymore.
And neither is Pierce, but you're both still our friends.
We've evolved.
Right, Jeff?
Yes, we have.
- And we all love each other.
- Mm-hmm.
And we all go to the same school, so, uh I guess I'll see ya when I see ya.
Hey, guess what.
I was on the wait list for biology, somebody got kicked out, I am-- Here to study!
Yay!
All hail, sir eats alone.
Shut up, Leonard.
I heard about your prescription socks.
Hope you don't mind, Jeff, but I've got a new favorite show, and I'm only on episode six.
You guys got about five minutes left to eat.
Oh, my, time flies when you're studying the science of life.
Well, I think time flies when you're joking around about movie titles that sound like names for poops.
Remains of the day.
Wait a second.
Were you eavesdropping on our study session?
I was eavesdropping on your goof-off session, and you dummies missed the most obvious one.
No, I said, "Green Mile".
Operation dumbo drop!
- Ew!
- Gross!
Too clever by half, Jeffrey.
All right, well uh, I gotta go.
Thanks for the five minutes.
Aw, Jeffrey.
Blimey.
The barrister's foreclosed the abbey.
Fancy a drink, then?
Oi, fetch us a hemlock.
Um - Um-- - Britta?
Why did everyone on Cougarton Abbey just die?
They only ran six episodes.
That's the great thing about British tv.
They give you closure.
No, no, no!
We'll find you a new favorite show!
We'll find you a new favorite show!
Come on, buddy.
You are human tennis elbow.
You are a pizza burn on the roof of the world's mouth.
You are the opposite of Batman.
You don't need them, man.
Exactly.
I'll see 'em when I see 'em.
Totally.
You and I, we should hang out some time, huh?
Grab a drink?
Sure.
Where are you living now?
The air vents.
I live in the air vents of the school.
Shhhh!
I'm free, Jeff.
Free!
I gotta get back in that class.
Real Dean coming through-- Oh, my goodness spacious, vice dean Is this where Greendale's money is going?
More accurately, Dean, it's where Greendale's money comes from.
Our air-conditioning program has a job placement rate five times higher than the rest of your school combined.
Our alumnini donations comprise 80% of your entire school's budget.
And you want to know why we think we deserve an espresso machine?
!
Well, I guess I didn't know.
I-- And you never had to, Dean.
You could have lived the rest of your life in blissful ignorance and died a happy, pansexual imp.
But you wanted to feel power this year.
Well, now, you're going to feel my power as it surges downward from me, straight through you, from nostril to rectum, now until the end of time.
And that's "whazup".
I forgot everything you said before "rectum"!
Who are these guys?
This is my legal team because I think it's time we worked out a new agreement.
He doesn't look like a lawyer.
That's a barber.
Because I'm also sick of that ridiculous goatee.
You look like a white Lou Gossett, Jr. You deserve a bigger office.
Biggest office I ever had.
I'm here to apologize, Dr. King, and beg you for a seat in biology.
I tell you what, 'N Sync, you wanna learn about life?
Give up the phone.
Oh.
You're asking me for a bribe?
I can't be bought, man.
You feel me?
See, prison was my walls.
But you put your walls up.
You, and your phone, and your attitude, and your fruit loops cologne.
Your walls put up so tight, man, not even a blade of grass could get through.
But even if it did, you wouldn't appreciate it.
That's why you can't come back to my class.
What's your problem with me, man?
And don't act like it's not about me specifically because you've been in-- Busted!
Hey!
Take it easy, Winger.
Everything okay?
It is now that I have this.
This is my ticket to getting back in the group.
Hey!
Hey!
I want to be in the group so bad!
All right, let's smoke 'em and choke 'em.
No!
No!
N-n-n-- Uh-oh!
What is that?
Monkey gas!
Monkey gas?
Oh, my g-- Abed?
All your friends are here.
They wanna talk to you.
I don't get it.
How is this different from the way he always is?
I don't want to push it, but this would be a great time to baptize him.
Abed, maybe this can be your new favorite show.
It's a British Sci-Fi series that's been on the air since 1962.
Britta, you've done enough, okay?
Why don't you go start a ruiners' club?
Oh wait, you'd probably just ruin it.
Well then, I'd be doing a good job because it's a ruiners' club.
You ruined my analogy.
Guys, look!
Blimey, inspector!
Where have we wound up this time?
The question isn't where, constable, but when.
Inspector, look out!
Blorgons!
Eradicate!
Eradicate!
This is the best show I've ever seen in my entire life.
Having fun without me again?
Jeff, what happened?
You look 70.
Abed has a new favorite tv show, Jeff.
It's called Inspector Spacetime-- Can it, boobs.
I came here to let you know that your best friend Pierce is the one that got me kicked out of bio class and the study group.
It was a plan he hatched from the beginning with his pal, Professor Kane.
But, Jeff, that's a photo I gave our professor of me visiting Hawthorne Wipes' spokesman and rap artist Sugar Cube in prison during the '90s.
Well, th-th-they look alike.
Uh, I guess they share one important feature in your eyes.
Well, that's not fair!
Look, I-I-I-I was standing far away, and I saw the prison uniform!
Oh, Jeffrey!
Oh, come on, obviously I don't mean all black people are in prison!
Oh!
Jeff, clearly you have gone off the deep end.
Don't blame him.
The table is powerful, and being cut off from it-- Shut the-- I've become Agitated.
I apologize.
We'll continue this discourse at a later date.
Good night.
He just needs some space.
I'm going to kill the one thing you love!
I'm gonna kill it!
As long as it breathes, it controls our lives!
I just came by to tell everyone this year isn't gonna be that different.
With the notable exception, we really won't have any money.
Have a nice night.
What is with that guy?
Did you find the monkey?
No, but here's the invoice for the gassing.
Okay, as it turns out, I cannot pay this Or your salaries starting on Two weeks ago.
But, what I do have are these vouchers for the classes of your choosing.
You're lucky I need my scuba certification.
Okay, okay.
I'm the one living in your vents.
I have no home and no job.
Does that mean you'll work for room and board?
Okay, I was lying the whole time.
I didn't want the group to evolve.
I just didn't want Pierce around.
I hate him.
Okay, but Jeff, what you did-- it's hard to get past that.
I know you're already out of the study group, but I'm gonna have to ask that you stop being my friend.
Okay, look, everybody, here's the thing, I am not as evolved as I said I was.
The biology class was full, so I told Professor Kane I'd pay him a few thousand dollars to K-kick Jeff out.
What?
!
Pierce!
What?
I can't believe Jeff attacked a table with a fire axe and still only managed to be the second craziest man in the room.
Okay, everybody in favor of voting Pierce out of the group?
Stop!
Stop!
Pierce isn't crazy.
The table IsMagic.
As someone who's been on the other side, I can tell you, it is a scary, lonely, Chang-filled world out there, and sure, this group has sprouted some legs, but why are we in such a rush to leave the tide pool, when the only things waiting for us on shore are the sands of time.
And the hungry seagulls of slowly growing apart.
Man, I really need this biology class.
Pierce!
Professor Kane has never taken a bribe from anyone in his life.
You feel me?
Yeah, I lied, but you seem to have a harder time being the bad guy than me.
You're right.
I do Which, in a weird way, makes me a pretty bad guy.
We're one and the same.
Please don't.
Jeff, but you're still kicked out of biology.
Oh, I'm not worried about it.
Life has a way of breaking through.
So, uh, here's what I'm thinking.
I'm a drug dealer, right?
And you're a scientist, so couldn't we get, like, a Breaking Bad type of thing going?
Sorry, star-face, you just lost your seat in my class.
There, now the table is good as new.
And so is Abed.
Britta, I'm sorry I was overprotective about it.
I'll try and be more supportive of you.
Well, here's your first chance.
Helping Abed has inspired me to finally declare a major.
I'm gonna study Psychology.
Like in a research capacity?
No, in a hands-on capacity.
I'm gonna be a therapist.
Oh.
Hey, hey, hey, keep it down.
There's a new sheriff in town.
- Oh, interesting.
So this is the year we all die.
- Yes, it is.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
By the end of WWII President Roosevelt had finally succumbed to the polio that afflicted him his entire life.
Which brings me to the Yalta Conference.
Who can tell me three key points brought up there?
Annie.
The demilitarization of Germany-- I'm sorry.
Annie Kim.
The demilitarization of Germany, the establishment of Poland's borders and the formation of the United Nations.
Side note: The results of Yalta would later set the stage for the Cold War.
Oh, boy, spoiler alert.
Somebody just won a ride in the wheelchair.
I'm proud of you for deciding on a major, Britta.
I'd like to thank the lord in my prayers about you, but you're still dressing like a streetwalker.
Yep, I'm getting serious.
I got a backpack, I got a new notebook.
Oh, I got one of those see-through yellow pens so I can do that thing where you color in the words.
Highlight?
Probably the backpack.
Free the damascus three.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, whoa.
I know this girl.
We used to protest together all the time and now she's locked up in Syria.
Oh, that's terrible.
Yes, it's terrible.
She's imprisoned by an oppressive regime halfway around the world and I'm, what?
In college?
Where are my values?
Man, she's got a Facebook group?
My first cop flashlight.
Can't wait to get some brains on this bad boy.
Are you safe, ma'am?
Everything okay?
Is this guy bothering you?
- Huh?
Huh?
- Hey!
Who the hell do you think you are?
The badge says to serve and protect!
No, it doesn't.
"How's my smile"?
Oh, man.
What the hell am I in charge of?
See this garbage can?
Students coming out of the library bump into it.
You can serve and protect them from a nasty boo-boo.
What do I do if I see a crime?
What a security guard does-- Call a cop.
Where'd you even get these?
- Come on, let me keep them.
- No.
Please?
I swear they're just for sex!
We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away And this ragtag group of cut-ups is my study group.
Gang, this is Annie Kim from my Poli-Sci class.
We just figured out we had the same G.P.A. in high school.
Well, mine was higher if you consider my school's ranking.
Well, it sounds like you had a lighter course load, so.
Well, I was in a lot of clubs.
I founded 17 of them.
Well, I was actually thinking about founding a model U.N. here at Greendale.
Any interest?
I'll probably be busy, and you probably need to study, so see you in class.
Okay, goodbye.
Wow, Annie.
How progressive of you to have a multicultural evil twin.
An Asian Annie.
Obama's America.
Her name is Annie Kim, and she's not evil.
She's my friend.
Didn't look like it.
Yeah, you seemed pretty competitive with her.
You be careful, Annie.
They are ruthless.
What?
What?
Not Asians.
Women.
I'm not competing with her.
I find her adorable.
She's like a younger me.
You mean the younger you that took so much Adderall she tried to straighten the lines on our high school football field during a game?
Ooh, be careful, Annie.
You don't want this little girl to suck you back to the dark side.
Hey, guys, what're you trying to do here?
This is our Annie.
That little twerp is a can of Annie lite.
She couldn't hold a candle to the real thing in any category of anything.
Aw, well, I wasn't fishing for that.
You're the best, kiddo.
You know what else was the best?
The rainforests.
Too bad the fascist oligarchies are raping them to make hamburgers.
Look it up.
Looks like someone woke up on the regular side of the bed.
Britta's just having a rough time because her friend's in prison.
I went to her Facebook page.
It says she was tear-gassed and possibly beaten.
I haven't been tear-gassed in so long.
Well, you're on a new path now.
Oh, goody, a new path.
Is it lined with credit cards and flat screen TVs?
Does it go by an Ikea?
Maybe I don't want a new path!
Or any path.
Maybe my path is a war path that leads to the terrordome, n-words!
Okay, maybe I went too far.
Maybe I don't want to offend my African-American friends, but the larger point is, maybe I'm not done raging against the machine.
Raging against the what?
That sounds dangerous.
Don't worry.
She'll be bad at it.
Keep clear of the can.
Sir, step around the can.
Mind the can, student.
Hello is it me you're looking for I can see it in your eyes You just got yourself a warning.
I piss warnings, pig.
You're all I ever wanted  And that's how we do that.
Hey!
I got my eye on you, missy.
Hi.
You okay, kiddo?
Yeah, yeah.
You know what's funny?
This is so silly.
Remember little Annie Kim from Poli-Sci?
Boy, she just took my model U.N. idea and just  She is quite the little go-getter.
Wait, what?
She stole your idea?
Sneak attack.
That's just like-- Not women, Asians.
Well, the real important thing is that there is a model U.N.
It doesn't really matter who starts it.
It just means her name goes on some charter and she gets to put it on her rÃ©sumÃ©.
And lead the Greendale team to the national model U.N., and meet Kofi Annan, Boutros Boutros Ghali, and Will.I.Am.
Boutros Boutros Ghali?
I'm gonna find this little brat's off-switch.
Jeff!
He's just being protective.
I'll stop him.
I am so excited that we finally have a model U.N. here at Greendale.
I am really, really, really, really, really, really into model U.N.s. They used to call me model U.N. guy back in college.
Well, that's not-- don't research that.
The important thing here is that I am really-- Pardon me, Professor Cligoris.
Cligoris?
Either pronunciation is fine?
Are you here for the model U.N.?
I'm here to tell you that the entire idea to have a model U.N. was hers.
Really?
So you're Clark M. Eichelburger.
So I've had your photo around my neck since I was in high school.
I'm talking about the Greendale model U.N. My Annie gave this other Annie the idea and the diabolical little b--usybody stabbed her in the back.
It's childish.
Honestly I'm just happy there is a model U.N. Annie, is this true?
I recall other Annie mentioned the concept, but she certainly didn't take the initiative to find a faculty advisor.
I didn't know that all you had to do was call dibs.
I'm not calling dibs.
Because I'm not a petty competitive child that steals ideas.
I simply refuse to acknowledge the authority of your criminal model U.N. So don't recognize it.
It still exists.
Oh, then Annie'll just start her own model U.N. Yeah, for grown-ups.
Well, I still don't recognize it.
Well, it exists, baby!
I'm sorry, I don't understand your relationship here.
Is he your father or your lover?
-  - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
There can only be one model U.N. that officially represents this school so let's take our foot off the crazy pedal for just a moment here.
There's only one rational way to settle this.
A head-to-head model U.N. Battle Royale, the rules to which I would have to spend the evening devising.
We'll have the competition tomorrow in the cafeteria at 7:00 P.M. May the most United Nations win.
- Fair enough.
- Totally fair.
I'll see you in the fair papers, other Annie.
Oh, and you were asking what our relationship is?
- We're friends.
- Yeah.
- Good friends.
- Grown-up friends.
- Yeah.
- So.
We're friendly.
So, the key to winning this thing is when in doubt, agree with Annie.
That's sweet, Jeff.
But everyone should just have fun.
Then again, what's more fun than winning?
Pierce.
I'm offended you would single me out.
Did you read up on your country's info-packet?
Yes.
Somalia has 1,900 miles of coastline, a government that knows its place, and all the guns and wives you can afford to buy.
Why have I never heard of this paradise before?
I studied up on my country.
Is it okay if we do accents, sugar?
Troy, Georgia the country, not the state.
That's right.
Capital city Tbilisi, and former member of the Soviet Union.
And we kindly request y'all mind your Ps and Qs.
Welcome to the world's first ever model U.N.-off.
You will each be scored on your U.N.'s ability to pass resolutions, follow procedure, and maintain order.
The end goal, of course, total world peace.
Any questions?
Does two U.N.s mean there are two earths?
Uh, yeah.
Sure, two earths.
Parallel earths in different galaxies or identical earths in parallel dimensions?
The latter one.
Well, what does that say about free will?
Abed!
Professor-- Right, yeah, let's begin.
Ready, set, peace.
Crisis alert.
A civil war has broken out in Ethiopia.
Rebel forces have seized the grain supply, creating a humanitarian disaster.
Okay, cool heads, everyone.
America proposes a U.N. peacekeeping force of Uruguay agrees.
Ooh, uh, China, too.
Georgia--the country-- is much obliged.
There's gonna be refugees.
Who can take refugees?
The great country of Somalia.
This gem, this Shangri-La graciously invites the Ethiopian refugees to enjoy safe lodging and cool ocean breezes on its sand-swept beaches.
Okay, we're rolling.
Switzerland proposes a peace summit.
Good idea, Switzerland.
And maybe at the peace summit we can discuss the possibility of opening a portal to Earth II.
Can we put a pin in that, Switzerland?
Earth II is out there, can't ignore it forever.
Well, China has money.
Does anybody want some?
Yes!
The United States proposes using China's money to fund agricultural programs to support Ethiopia's sustainable farms.
Which should promote economic development and security.
All in favor?
It's unanimous.
Good resolving, blue U.N. You really covered all the bases.
We have a unanimous decision as well.
Then after one round, we are tied.
Looks like both U.N.s are experts at fostering unity.
- Crap.
- Damn it.
Crisis alert.
Russia This is what the United Nations is doing to your freedom.
I'm your freedom!
And I'm in a cage.
With the world!
Because of them!
I thought I'd find you here.
What are you gonna do, lock me up?
Just give me a reason.
I'll give you a reason!
Whoa!
That's it, you're coming with me.
Hello is it me you're looking for He's pulling my cage.
I'm being pulled in my cage for no reason!
Is anybody seeing this?
Is the world seeing this?
Are we facebooking this?
Crisis alert!
A tsunami has hit Vietnam.
Massive--crisis alert, famine in Ghana-- crisis alert--tuberculosis outbreak--crisis alert!
Humanitarian aid.
We further resolve-- - Disarmament treaty.
- Crisis alert!
To help women and children get through famines.
Save the orphans.
Loose nukes-- sinkhole-- North Korea-- the prime minister in exile!
Military coup!
The tropical paradise of Somalia graciously yields.
- China will pay.
- Gooder than grits.
Switzerland is very concerned about Earth II.
Uruguay agrees.
Uruguay sounds like "you're a gay".
Backyard barbecue!
Uruguay kindly requests that Somalia stop pronouncing it "you're a gay".
- Hereditary monarchy!
- Resolved.
- Graft and corruption.
- Resolved.
Crisis alert!
All: Resolved.
Looking good, blue U.N. Getting very close to world peace.
That's my girl.
You are kicking ass.
All right, guys, this is the home stretch.
All we gotta do is focus.
Oh!
Damn, Pierce.
Ooh, that wasn't me.
I don't smell anything-- whup, I just got it.
Oh, it's in my mouth.
Guys, come on, focus.
Like adults.
We're gonna lose a point if we don't get through this.
Get through it?
It's almost a solid.
Crisis alert.
A genocidal dictator in Laos-- Yeah, yeah, we'll get to that.
Okay, so, looking at Turkey, what can you do?
So let me get this straight.
You're bringing her in here for "making a mess".
I did more than make a mess.
I turned your whole system inside out.
And I shut her down.
Young lady, you spilled paint on a globe.
You're as much a criminal as this idiot is a cop.
None whatsoever.
Okay, but, um, she's going to do something illegal.
Aren't you?
Is that true?
Do you, Britta Perry, have any intentions of breaking any laws ever?
I-I- Oh, my God.
No, it's not that simple.
I have a life now.
I have a major and-- Get out please.
I have highlighters.
Get out!
Okay, I know you've got a lot on your mind right now.
But somebody broke that thing that comes down from the parking booth.
You know the thing that comes down, keeps thecars from coming in.
The thing.
It's like a gate, but it's just a stick.
Comes down, from a hinge.
Keeps the cars out.
Goes up and down 90 degrees.
The arm?
Ooh, point goes to red team.
How is this still happening?
I can't remember what regular air smells like.
Do something or we're gonna lose.
Guys, this is important to Annie.
So whoever actually died a few months ago, 'fess up so we can put a stake through your heart.
Jeff!
Annie, I think the real lesson here is that a model U.N., much like the real U.N., quickly falls apart when faced with actual-- Noooooo!
I think the lesson here is that I need to win this!
I want to win!
And you!
You suck!
You're a stupid, ugly poopface!
I'm better than you!
Annie, stop.
You're acting like a little schoolgirl and not in a hot way.
Okay.
Uh, that made me sound creepy.
But--but here's the thing.
Don't look at me.
If embarrassment were bountiful zinc deposits, I'd be Zambia.
There's nothing to be Zambia about, Annie.
This is all my fault.
I pushed you into competing with other Annie.
Are you kidding me?
I practically ran to you with that flier.
I wanted to destroy her.
All because I can't handle the thought of anyone getting more gold stars than me.
I'm such a child.
You're not.
Listen, when you really hate someone the way you hate Annie Kim, or when you feel the way I feel about you, the easy loophole through the creepiness and danger is to treat them like a child.
"A chip off the old block, you're the best, kiddo".
It's a crutch.
It's a way for me to tell you how important you are from a distance.
But now you're becoming this mature, self-possessed, intelligent young woman, and I can't keep patting you on the head or talking down to you.
But I like how close we are.
I don't want to grow up if it means losing what we have.
Well, tough, Annie.
You have to grow up because the world needs more women like you.
Can't keep doing this forever, kiddo.
Can't we?
- Nope.
I can't, no.
- Nope, that's gross.
That feels gross.
Well, I better go check on the group.
If they haven't left already.
I'll follow you.
From a respectable distance.
Guys?
I'm sorry I put you through that.
And I know it doesn't make up for what happened, but would it help if I said I farted?
Annie, no.
I can't let you fall on that sword because I farted.
No, I farted.
I farted.
Guys, I wasn't doing the Spartacus thing.
I farted.
No, seriously, I-- We all farted.
Oh, you guys!
- Annie - I'm farting now.
Wait, why are you still here?
Abed may have figured out a way we can still win.
Really?
How?
It's simple, really.
First we  Abed, what did I tell you?
You can't just mumble nonsense.
No one's cutting away.
Okay, fine, here's my actual plan.
What is that?
It's from Britta.
She's promising to disrupt the modelU.N.
She says she's gonna cause a disruption that, while not completely illegal, should be a real concern to campusSecurity!
Oh, no.
Maybe we should call the real cops.
You know, back in the '80s, I had this real piece of work protestor, used to always give me trouble.
You know what happened to her?
She incited a riot at the W.T.O. Got choked until she passed out.
By some real cop with a real billyclub.
Sometimes I wonder, you know?
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go show that hippie how the world really works.
Aren't you forgetting something?
All in favor?
Aye?
Could you morons say aye any slower?
Come on.
- Greetings, people of Earth II.
- What is this?
We represent the United Nations from Earth I. Using our Switzerland's hadron collider and resources from every nation, the people of our planet have constructed a trans-dimensional gateway here.
They can't do this.
The science works out.
- Yes.
-  We come to you with an offer.
We he achieved world peace, tying our score with yours.
But we are willing to concede our victory if you agree conceding yours, forming one gigantic United United Nations.
We did it.
You're a fool.
Your ultimatum is itself a technical act of aggression.
If we simply refuse to recognize your authority, we still remain ahead and you lose.
But you win a simple game.
The larger symbolic victory will be ours.
Oh la la.
We refuse.
I'll take the real victory.
A logical, effective, common sense move, Annie Kim.
One which flies in the very face of the United Nations itself, a fundamentally symbolic organization founded on the principles of high-minded rhetoric and empty gestures.
Blue U.N. wins.
What the hell are you doing?
Nothing.
And you can't do anything to stop me.
Did someone say "can't do anything"?
Hello is it me you're looking for I can see it in your eyes I can see it in your smile you're all I've ever wanted  And my arms are open wide 'cause you know just what to say and you know just what to do Oh, that's-- that's nice.
No?
And I want to tell you so much I knew you'd come.
- You're so busted.
-  I love you  Yes.
I told you to stop playing Operation on me!
I'm not your damn board game!
At least you didn't get my spare ribs.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
I really made my bones with that last collar, babe.
Today's the day.
You woke up with a guard this morning.
But tonight, you're going to bed with a detective.
ShhOkay, you get some rest, 'kay?
Probably need it.
Here's Ben dressed like a dragon.
Aww.
Here's me and Abed dressed as Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy.
Aww.
Who's Nick Nolte?
Aww.
Hey, Abed, can I borrow some change for the water fountain?
Yeah.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Wait.
Change?
- Hey, Dean.
- Hmm?
What are you doing?
Nothing after lunch.
And I can skip lunch if you want-- Oh.
That.
Keeps tuition down and it saves on water, too.
That's because nobody's gonna pay to drink water.
Actually it's a two drink-minimum.
It'll be reflected in your tuition.
Hey, Dean.
Thanks for the new digs.
Ah, eh, remember what we talked about?
We have to keep this whole living situation kind of quiet.
You know, on the d-low.
Sure, you know, I'm barely there.
I'm married to the job.
And to a mannequin leg I found in the boiler room.
Homewrecker.
Your first major lab assignment is to construct a terrarium.
Sort of like a diorama.
You guys have weird reactions to stuff.
Hey, can I ask you something?
This is unrelated.
As someone who just finished spending the majority of his life in prison, what happened with legos?
They used to be simple.
Oh, come on, I know you know what I'm talking about.
Legos were simple.
Something happened out here while I was inside.
Harry Potter legos, Star Wars legos.
Complicated kits, tiny little blocks.
I mean, I'm not saying it's bad, I just wanna know what happened.
All right, fine.
Your terrariums are due tomorrow.
And everyone look across the table at the person in front of you.
That's your lab partner for the rest of the semester.
Saddle up.
Who are these people?
Give me some rope, tie me to a tree give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away Um, hello, please, Professor Kane?
Yes?
I know you haven't been here at Greendale very long, but, umWe're a study group.
It's kind of a thing.
We've been through a lot.
You probably heard of the space bus.
Paintball.
I had sex with Eartha Kitt in an airplane bathroom, and these are the only guys I've ever told.
Yeah, we're like a family.
We love each other.
Second paintball.
What is happening at this school?
I have so many conversations that make no sense.
Uh, we'd really prefer to partner up amongst ourselves.
I don't care.
Go ahead.
It's not you, it's me.
I'm just trying to protect us both from more pain down the road.
I may have a developmental disorder.
I need to catch up on Breaking Bad, so I'm so sorry.
I have a developmental disorder.
Star Wars, Star Wars.
Cool, cool, cool.
Hmm.
You understand.
You're also, quite frankly, a very weird-looking man.
I don't know you, but I just don't trust you.
And I don't think I could grow to like you.
The point of what I'm trying to tell you, Todd, is that I don't want to be your lab partner.
No offense.
None taken.
I understand, you wanna be with your friends.
Don't tell me what I'm feeling or thinking.
It's petty.
Good-bye, Todd.
Okay, how are we gonna divide the-- Hey, Todd!
Todd, buddy!
You passed the test.
I've been walking my beat a long time, sir.
A long time.
I've kept my head down, paid my dues.
And, well, I think I'm ready to make detective.
You've only been here a month.
You really haven't done much of anything.
And there's no such thing as security guard detective.
We don't solve crimes.
We barely prevent them.
You wanna detect something?
Do it on your own time.
Maybe I will.
"Maybe I will".
My own words rang in my head like a bell inside a head.
Maybe I was crazy.
Or maybe, just maybe, I was a detective.
- Hey.
- What?
- Looking for something?
- No.
She said she wasn't, but her eyes said otherwise.
She was all dame, legs that went all the way to the bottom of her torso.
The kind of arms that had elbows.
UmDid you just call me in here to stare at me?
The way she left, I could tell that somebody-- or something--had really put the scare on her.
But what?
Why?
Stapler.
Was I crazy?
Or were they somehow connected?
I can't believe it.
This is the first time there hasn't been a beetle in here.
- Should we move outside?
- Uh-huh.
Did you even hear what I said?
- Uh-huh.
- Seriously?
Is this what it's gonna be like working together?
What?
I lost three followers?
Man, people just can't handle the truth about Ben Sherman's winter collection.
Roommates, study group, lab partners.
We really are gonna spend all our time together.
How awesome is that?
Very.
You know what else is awesome?
Last night I saw the Hong Kong movie.
That Kickpuncher is based on.
Yeah, I know, I was there.
Did you see the scene where Kickpuncher kick-punches Yeah.
Both of them.
Oh.
We spend too much time together.
Jinx.
Here's Ben with his cupcake.
And here he is a few seconds later when he was crying because he dropped his cupcake.
Mm-hmm.
And here he is with another cupcake.
Oh, oh, wait, these pictures are out of order.
That's the same cupcake.
Oh, Shirley, these pictures are adorable.
And comprehensive.
But did you know that sugar is like baby meth?
That's what my homeopath said.
Well, maybe your gay friend should mind his own business.
"Forget about the girl," I told myself.
"Let her go, like a lobster claw letting go of a small balloon for lobsters".
Still, I had a hunch.
Hmm.
A matchbook.
Something about it seemed clue-y.
"Arizona matchbook company".
Arizona.
Arizona backwards is still Arizona!
It's a palomino!
Maybe I was crazy Or maybe I was finally sane.
Why does this guy keep staring at me?
Britta.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I was just getting some air.
Me too.
And wondering something.
I was wondering something, too.
- Tell me.
- No, you first.
I was wondering, what would it be like - if we were partners?
- What's going on here?
Were you thinking of changing partners?
Who's thinking of changing partners?
Were you gonna bail on me?
No.
No one here is thinking of changing partners.
No, sir.
I am!
While he was spying, I found a turtle.
It's not fair that I should be the only one here saddled with a total waste of space loser.
- No offense, Todd.
- None taken.
Why should you all get the exact partner you wanted?
That's right.
It's totally not fair that we saddled Pierce with Todd.
We should probably choose partners again.
I mean, just to be fair.
So it's agreed.
Let's go to the study room and deal with this Todd problem once and for all.
Okay.
Um, did you want me to come?
Um, it's called "the Todd problem".
Okay, we just have to come up with a fair way to decide who is gonna be stuck for an entire semester with this Random.
This, uh Non-grouper.
No offense, Todd.
None taken.
I'm happy to work with whoever.
There's only one way to decide this fairly.
We go boy-girl, boy-girl.
But everyone has to have a different hair color.
And be from a different high school.
And be a different race.
I guess I'd be with Britta.
I guess my--my hands are tied.
The hair color concept intrigues me because it's how I distinguish you anyway.
But what if we arrange by age, so that way the young people can work while the old people sleep and vice versa.
Um, I-I was just wondering who you considered old, because I'd like to remind you again that I'm just about the same age as Jeff.
Oh, I was counting Jeff as old, too.
Hey!
Oh, well, that's all right then.
I just don't understand how my age has anything to-- Oh, for heaven's sake, Pierce!
I was thinking the thing that would be most beneficial-- you know, for the group-- would be to pair the people with the lowest GPAs with the highest.
Hmm.
Interesting.
The highest carrying the lowest?
I can see how you might want that.
You know what, Annie?
Pew, pew, pew, pew, p-- Wait, no.
Pew, pew, pew, pew.
Does anyone else have kids?
Because I have a gorgeous little newborn that I'd like to get-- Oh, perfect!
You'll enjoy talking to Shirley about her kids.
Uh-uh, don't go trying to pawn Todd off on me.
Again, none taken.
Guys, our terrariums are due tomorrow and it's already nine.
Okay, let's make this simple and do it like student housing.
Everyone write down their lab partner preferences from one to eight.
Abed, you're a computer.
You figure out a way to put us in our optimal pairings.
And before you all go putting Todd down last, don't forget he comes with a turtle.
You're halfway done.
How does that sound?
Somebody wake up Pierce.
Hello, Arizona matchbook company.
I had to get some answers.
And I needed answers like a fish needs a bicycle-- A lot.
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, I am, uh, interested in your matchbooks.
Yes, would you like to place an order?
I had to think fast.
- Yes.
- Get away from my desk.
I'll call you back.
You've been walking around campus asking people weird questions and then staring at them while slightly moving your lips?
I had to think fast.
No.
Ben I think this job might be getting to you.
I think you need to take some time off.
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Very much so.
Yes.
All right, yep.
According to my system, Annie's gonna be with Shirley.
Pierce is with me.
Troy is with Britta.
And Jeff is with Todd.
Okay, let's get to work.
Uh, wait.
Um, how did I end up with Todd?
I mean, no offense, but he wasn't exactly at the top of my list.
None taken.
It's what the algorithm dictated.
And we're just supposed to trust your algorithm?
You're questioning my algorithm?
Not necessarily.
Is your algorithm above questioning?
Not necessarily.
Will you just tell us how you chose?
I used the ballots to rank everyone by popularity.
And I put the most popular with the least popular.
I figured it would maximize each partnership's audience appeal.
Oh, I-I see.
So I was number one, and he was obviously number eight.
No offense, Todd.
You and Todd were four and five.
I was four?
- Todd was four.
- I was five?
Well, that's insane!
We don't even know him.
He's a stranger.
Please, Jeff.
It has feelings.
Wait, so we all know Annie was number one, because she'd do all the work.
And Shirley was her partner, so But that means-- so you all put-- I just worked it out.
I'm more popular than someone!
Getting the matchbooks shipped to me the same day wasn't easy.
I had to pay the company money.
I used Nunez's card.
He'd thank me at the Detective Awards.
Somewhere, somehow, I was gonna find what I was looking for.
Holy Mary, mother of God.
Was I crazy?
Or was I on the verge of something?
My mind reeled with thoughts.
Voices.
Stand-up premises.
Why don't they just make tires out of pavement so you can drive on anything?
What's up with buttons?
What would happen if Nicholson was a gynecologist?
There was something there.
I need a notepad.
Maybe a blazer.
Honey, I-I-I don't know when I'll be home.
How could you guys hate me more than Pierce?
Or anything more than Pierce?
Thin ice, Shirley.
My friends and I are not gonna let you drive a wedge between us.
Shirley has a point.
This list stinks like a butt convention.
How else could you explain Troy being so unpopular?
Uh, I think I was the popular one in our pairing.
Oh, Troy.
Fine, why don't I just go work with Todd?
Hey, that's cool, whatever gets this project done.
Oh, wow, what a great guy.
I can see why all of you like him so much more than me.
Jeff, maybe it's just that no one wants to carry you all year.
Gee, you're right, Annie, it's not personal.
I mean, it's not like people really like you.
You're just a good grade in a tight sweater.
You're just a bad grade in a tight sweater.
And who the hell are you always texting?
Everyone you know is here.
Okay, let's all just take a breath-- Don't get your number four stink on this, Todd.
Okay, let's focus.
We're all the same people we were 12 hours ago.
Maybe we should just revert to our original pairings.
But I thought you didn't want to carry Jeff.
Oh, you just don't want to work with Shirley.
You too, brute?
It's just You're a creationist!
- What?
- You're so religious.
How are you gonna do science experiments if you don't even believe in science?
Just because someone's religious doesn't mean they have a problem with science.
And certainly, if an introductory biology course at a community college can refute 2,000 years of miracles-- And what about Britta?
She's not gonna dissect anything.
Fine, you got me, I won't dissect anything with a face.
What about worms?
Do they have tiny little faces?
This is why you're the stupidest!
If loving worms is stupid, I don't wanna be smart.
It is, and you can't be.
Guys, I just figured it all out.
Pierce, wake up, Jeff is gonna heal us.
We have been looking at this totally wrong.
There's no way I'm unpopular.
One of you monsters just put me last in a petty attempt to humble me.
Oh!
I just had a terrible nightmare that Jeff was a pompous ass.
Also Todd was there.
Uh, no offense, Todd.
I'd poked my nose where it didn't belong.
Someone--or something-- had sent me a message.
Veronica.
It was my fault she had gotten mixed up in all this.
Uh-uh, Todd.
Pretty sure I heard a fire alarm.
Nobody's going home until we see those ballots.
See the ballots?
Are you crazy?
I say let's lay our cards on the table and see what everyone really thinks of each other.
Get behind me, Abed.
Jeff, stop it!
Pass!
Give it to me!
No, get back, get back!
I am doing this for all of us.
Oh, no, she's got her marijuana lighter.
Don't!
Noooo!
The turtle is in there!
Oh, my God, I am so sorry!
What is wrong with you people?
Huh?
I thought you were supposed to be friends!
I thought you were supposed to love each other!
Your love is weird.
And toxic!
And it destroys everything it touches!
I no longer care about grades.
Or biology.
Or finally graduating from college, like I promised my dying father.
I'm going home.
I'm gonna hold my wife and my child close.
And I am gonna finally take my Insulin shot!
Offense taken.
Offense taken.
Well, he is right about one thing.
You're all terrible people.
And I don't care about this stupid assignment.
I'm going home.
No, I'm not, I'm going to biology class.
It starts in 15 minutes.
And eventually, this caterpillar will come out of its cocoon.
And then-- Pop, pop!
Nice work, you two.
You know they're laughing at you, right?
I mean, that's my theory.
Now, super group.
I can't help but notice a sorry lack of terrariums.
We didn't have time to finish.
Here's mine.
When did you even have time to do that?
You're pathological.
It's too late for flattery.
Professor, obviously this isn't working out.
You're just gonna have to put us with our original lab partners.
- All right?
- I don't have to do anything.
Not after you broke my boy Todd.
That man called me crying this morning.
You know he fought in Iraq, right?
We had a name for people like you in prison.
We called you "the mean clique".
But I have a solution.
All seven of you will share a microscope, one bench, and one grade that I will average.
Everyone else gets their own stuff.
So can we get an extension on the first assignment?
No.
You all fail.
Oh, my God.
How did this happen?
And did I miss the firemen?
Dean, the explanation is simple.
It's all connected.
A web of conspiracy that goes all the way to the top of Arizona.
All Right.
Hey, somebody's been squatting in the utility closet.
There's a hot plate back there, thousands of matches.
I mean, we're looking at dozens of major health and fire code violations.
I think we're gonna have to get the police involved.
And that's when it hit me.
I was in really big trouble.
Dean.
Dean?
Oh, uhNo.
No need to get the cops.
With a conspiracy this big, they're probably involved.
- What?
- What Chang says makes a lot of sense, and, um Okay, you know what?
I quit.
I mean, I can deal with the not getting paid, but I draw the line at you enabling this man.
I mean, I'm seriously concerned that he's mentally ill.
And--and it's not funny at all.
It's scary.
- The top of Arizona - I needed to know more.
- Was it a very high mesa?
- About those firemen.
- Or was it a state of mind?
- Were they ethnically diverse?
- Either way, I was going - Did they bring a dalmatian?
- To have to climb it.
- Could I buy a calendar?
Okay, screw this.
I-I quit.
Hmm?
Well, it seems that Greendale owes you a debt of gratitude.
How would you like to be the new head of security?
I had to think fast.
Yes.
I don't know, was I crazy?
Or was I just doing right by the school?
- This is awkward, isn't it?
- Yeah.
You know, I think it's pretty clear what destroyed the balance in our study group's ecosystem.
Ranking one person above another.
Letting our differences get the bets of us.
- Racism?
- No.
Todd.
Todd!
Did you see the head on that guy?
"None taken".
What was wrong with him?
Not to be unchristian, but that boy sucked.
I missed this.
Aww!
And his dumb baby!
- I know!
- On and on.
He wouldn't shut up.
These questions are really personal.
Are you sure this is anonymous?
Yeah, they're just practice evaluations for my psych class.
All right.
Who did a butt?
They're boobs.
And I don't know.
Take it again.
All right.
Somebody drew a penis.
Oh!
And another penis.
Penis, penis, penis.
Very mature, guys.
- I didn't draw a penis.
- Me neither.
Yeah, these are all normally filled out tests.
Ha ha!
Gotcha!
This was also a test, and you all penised.
Passed.
Maybe I need to take one.
A test.
Not a penis.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Didn't they say 304?
No, 303.
Ever down twice.
Troy and Abed's new apartment!
Hiiii!
- Come on in.
- Come on.
Wow.
What a great place.
You guys--you guys look so fancy.
Thanks.
We read a book on how to be the perfect party hosts.
Rule number one-- dress to impress.
Rule number two-- avoid touchy topics like the negro problem.
The book was written in the '40s.
- Yeah.
Oh, good, you guys are finally here.
Finally?
Shirley showed up at 3:00.
Time flies when I'm baking.
No, it doesn't.
Oh, the door downstairs was propped open with this.
This is really unsafe.
Anyone could have just wandered into your building.
Like one of our guests?
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you, Troy.
Let me give you ladies the grand tour.
Bathroom, kitchen, who cares, and this is my scale model of the rolling Boulder scene from raiders With actual rolling Boulder.
Ooh.
AdiÃ³s, Sapito.
Annie & Britta: Ahh.
Pretty cool, huh?
Super cool.
And sexy.
Super sexy cool.
Overselling it.
I made pizza.
But we ordered real pizza.
Well, there's nothing more real than homemade.
You didn't have some of the ingredients, so I used ketchup and cream cheese.
We ordered real pizza.
Okay.
Hey, got you that.
Bienvenido de la Casa Chez Trobed.
Very nice.
Oh, look, Indiana Jones and the apartment of perpetual virginity.
Chop busted, fellow adult, chop busted.
It's nice.
Not mansion-nice, but it's nice.
Didn't you used to live in a mansion with me?
Yeah, but this is more my speed and century.
Doesn't bother me.
I've hardly missed you at all since I had you removed from my portraits.
Jeff!
Check it out.
Serbian rum.
So strong it is banned there.
Banned in Serbia, Jeff.
Let that concept sink in.
Yeah, well, you enjoy.
I have to leave early.
- Oh?
- Yeah, sorry.
I've got an invite to the opening of a new club.
Look at this place.
It's like it was designed for me.
It was.
I made that in Photoshop and mailed it to you a month ago so that you'd keep tonight open on your calendar.
There's no such thing as single malt platinum boobs and billiards club?
I guess I never said it out loud.
Tonight we offer something far more than boobs and billiards.
- What?
- One word, two syllables.
Don't say charades.
Troy & Abed: Yahtzee!
Is charades off the table?
Come on.
And Okay.
Now "How to play Yahtzee".
Is there nothing from our youth that these companies won't repackage for a buck?
Call it Yahtzee all you want.
Everybody knows it's Puerto Rican chess.
Annie, it's just the pizza.
We can't buzz him up.
Someone has to go down.
Okay.
Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.
Just so you know, Jeff, you are now creating six different timelines.
Of course I am, Abed.
Two.
One, two-- Annie.
Okay, fine.
I guess I'm going down.
All this talk of going down Did you guys know I had sex with Eartha Kitt in an airplane bathroom?
We're about to eat.
It's not namedropping if it comes up organically.
I'm gonna check in on my pies.
- Roxa-- - No.
Bathroom?
Over here.
Uh, guys?
What does a pregnancy test look like?
Like a thin piece of plastic with a thing on the end of it.
Okay, so this is definitely a gun.
Whoa!
Yeah, put that away.
Oh, my-- Why does Annie have a gun?
That's not a gun, that's a girl's peashooter.
Here, Troy.
Happy housewarming.
Jeff, what are we gonna do about this?
I'm gonna get a drink.
Ow!
What's so funny?
I don't know, people hitting their heads.
Don't fight over them.
Well, y-you can fight a little.
Smells weird.
I beg your pardon?
Smells weird.
What did you do?
Abed, you don't ask someone a question like that.
It's not dignified.
Pizza!
Pizza, pizza, go in tummy me so hung-ee me so hung-ee That pizza guy was super creepy.
So you're saying he was a pizza guy?
I wonder what happened in those other timelines.
Abed, there are no other timelines.
Okay.
Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.
Just so you know, Jeff, you are now creating six different timelines.
Of course I am, Abed.
Four.
One, two, three, four-- Shirley.
Okay, just don't let my pies burn.
Remember, no one eats those pies.
Come on, let's just talk to her.
We tried that, Annie, but she ignored us.
The woman has a baking problem.
Now, I-I don't like being the bad guy anymore than anybody else-- - Roxa-- - No.
Bathroom?
Yeah, over here.
We have a pact.
We do not enable her baking.
It's gonna be better for her in the long run.
Heh, you know who got it in the long run.
Eartha Kitt, when I nailed her in the airplane bathroom.
Ew, Pierce.
What?
Came up organically.
Here, Troy.
Happy housewarming.
Oh, cool.
Thanks, Pierce.
What is it?
What?
It's a traditional Norwegian troll.
When Troy and I were living together, I had it on display in the hall.
You know, outside his bedroom.
He seemed very taken with it.
It used to watch me sleep!
Pierce, shame on you.
Jeff, what are you gonna do about this?
I'm gonna get a drink.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?
Barely felt it.
I'm gonna look at it in the bathroom.
It's not dignified.
Pizza!
Pizza, pizza in my tummy me so hung-ee me so hung-ee Did someone remember to take out my pies?
Seriously?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, no.
Seriously?
Shirley, it doesn't matter.
We weren't gonna eat them.
You're not allowed to have "baking things" as an identity.
Excuse me for being the only married woman in a group full of horny toads who sit around all night just making googly eyes at each other.
Googly eyes?
Shirley, it's okay.
Nobody makes googly eyes at me either.
We're the same.
Roxanne AdiÃ³s, Sapito.
I don't know why she's so upset.
Her pies probably didn't burn in the other timelines.
Abed, Shirley just had a nervous breakdown.
- More like a nervous-- - Bakedown!
I know!
I didn't say it on purpose.
And Abed, there are no other timelines.
Okay.
Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.
Just so you know, Jeff, you are now creating - six different timelines.
- Of course I am, Abed.
Three.
One, two, three-- Pierce.
Crap.
Speaking of crap, I was taking one in an airplane bathroom when Eartha Kitt decided to bang me.
What?
It's where my mind went.
Your mind went years ago.
Ugh.
I'm gonna check on my pies.
- Roxa-- - No.
Bathroom?
Yeah, over here.
I love your place, Troy.
You're all grown up now.
I can't believe those are real mahogany bunk beds in there.
I bet that cost you a few allowances.
Okay.
Aww!
Troy.
Now we done it.
Britta's in the bath-- AdiÃ³s, Sapito.
- Who is it?
- Troy.
Um, I'm washing my hands.
Good, then I can come in.
Oh, hi!
Um, I was smoking a cigarette.
I know what you were doing.
I'm 21 years old.
I'm a man.
I know that.
We all know that.
Then why is Jeff always picking on me?
You seem to be a little hard on Troy lately.
I'm gonna get a drink.
Ow!
Oh, my God, are you okay?
I barely felt it.
Well, let me look at it in the bathroom.
Britta's in the bathroom.
Oh, um Oh, no, what happened?
Minor head wound.
If there's an abrasion, we'll clean it with iodine and apply ice.
You make a good nurse.
Thanks.
Dr. Shirley says mini pies are the best medicine.
Then I'd like to see her degree.
He's butting antlers with you because you're a threat now.
You've got your own place, you've got a future, you've got a bowl full of olives next to the toilet.
It's a fancy party, Britta.
You know what Jeff has in his bathroom?
Neither do I. He keeps his toiletries in a safe under the sink.
His whole personality is based around guarding himself.
You don't have to be like that to be a man.
You're really cool, Britta.
Man, pizza guys are getting worse and worse-looking.
Guess all the good ones went into porn.
- Ceiling fan.
- I miss all the fun.
I wonder what happened in all those other timelines.
Troy & Britta: Who cares?
Okay.
Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.
Just so you know, Jeff, you are now creating six different timelines.
Of course I am, Abed.
Six.
One, two, three, four, five, six-- Britta.
- Great.
- Great.
You know what's great?
Air travel.
I've flown a lot, a lot of airplane stories.
I once had sex with Eartha Kitt-- Okay, I'm gonna check on my pies.
You guys are my best-- I'm gonna get a drink.
Ow!
Oh, my God, are you okay?
Barely felt it.
Let me look at it in the bathroom.
Do I need to refill the toilet olives?
- We're good.
I checked.
- You're the best.
Want to stay up all night talking in our bunk beds?
Duh-doy.
Here, Troy.
Happy housewarming.
Oh, cool.
Thanks, Pierce.
You make a good nurse, Annie.
Thank you.
I actually had to apply a tourniquet the other day.
A guy got stabbed outside my building-- What?
Annie, you've got to get the hell out of that apartment.
You don't have to treat me like a kid anymore, remember?
Yeah, but adults still need to be protected.
I-I can't help but worry about you, Annie.
You're important to me.
Feel the terror!
Stop the tantrum!
Feel the terror of the Norwegian troll!
What's going on in here?
Pierce is terrorizing Troy because he's jealous we moved in together.
You're the one who's jealous.
Why would I be jealous?
Because you're lonely and crazy.
Hey, guys, this is Toby, our pizza delivery guy.
And I know this is gonna sound nuts, but we're in love and we're getting married.
I wonder what happened in all those other timelines.
Wait, there are other timelines?
Okay.
Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.
Just you know, Jeff, you are now creating six different timelines.
Of course I am, Abed.
One.
Troy.
Damn it.
I'm gonna go as fast as I can so I don't miss anything.
AdiÃ³s, Sapito.
You know who I used to call miss anything?
Eartha Kitt.
What?
He totally set me up.
I'm gonna check in on my pies.
- Roxa-- - No.
- Bathroom?
- Yeah, over here.
Jeff, tell us about your father.
I'm gonna get a drink.
Ow!
Oh, my God, are you okay?
Barely felt it.
Well, let me look at it in the bathroom.
What the hell?
No!
Call 911!
Abed, help me stop the bleeding!
I'm dying!
- Pierce.
- I am dying.
You don't have to put on the red light Water.
Water!
Water!
Breathe, breathe.
Put on the red light put on the red light You.
Put on the red light Nooooooo!
Okay.
Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.
Just so you know, Jeff you are now creating six different timelines.
Of course I am, Abed.
Five.
One, two, three, four, five-- Abed.
I'm on it.
You know who else was on it?
And do you know what "it" is?
Everybody give me money.
Wow, that ascot really softens your personality.
Thanks.
I banged Eartha Kitt.
- Roxa-- - No.
Bathroom?
Down the hall.
I'm getting a drink.
Ow!
Oh, my God, are you okay?
Barely felt it.
Well, let me look at it in the bathroom.
Britta's in the bathroom.
Oh, no, what happened?
Minor head wound.
Oh, my God.
What smells amazing?
Oh!
Someone wants pie!
You make a good nurse.
Oh, my God.
They taste just like regular-size pies.
Oh, yay!
Happy housewarming.
Oh, cool.
Thanks, Pierce.
Hey, while we're alone, I just wanted to say, thanks for letting me live with you.
Sometimes I feel like making desserts is the only thing I'm good for in the group.
But now it's time for me to try and make it on my own.
Just like you did.
I can't help but worry about you, Annie.
Hey, I don't think you should open this.
No, what-- what are you talking about?
You're very important to me.
Crap.
I was not supposed to eat your stuff.
We all made an agreement.
Crap, I was not supposed to say that out loud!
Crap, okay, cards on the table, I'm really high right now.
- Seriously!
- Would you stop and give me-- No, I wanna give you something else.
A waterpik!
A speedboat!
Two waterpiks.
I can't believe I'm feeding my pies to a drug addict!
Drug addict?
You're a pie pusher!
You push pies to get love.
Give it, Pierce!
It feels fun!
I'm sorry, I just had a weird dÃ©jÃ  vu.
You're bad at gift-giving!
That thing you said about worrying about me It's something my dad always said.
I demand to be housewarmed!
Shouldn't have brought it up.
Just reminded me of my dad.
Anyway Stop.
A little Make Out 101.
Less dad talk.
And, uh, you could ease up on the bubblegum lip gloss.
No, I really-- No, you--!
Pizza time.
Give me this, you godless hippie skank!
You're a sick, sad, twisted old man.
And I hope you die alone.
I wonder what happened in all those other timelines.
I gotta say, I hope this is the real one, because I just found a nickel in the hallway.
Okay.
Starting on my left with one, your number comes up, you go.
Just so you know, Jeff, you are now creating - six different timelines.
- Of course I am, Abed.
I don't think you should.
Chaos already dominates enough of our lives.
The universe is an endless raging sea of randomness.
Our job isn't to fight it, but to weather it--together.
On the raft of life.
A raft held together by those few rare, beautiful things that we know to be predictable.
Ropes?
Vines.
Vines?
Let him finish!
Us.
It won't matter what happens to us as long as we stay honest and accepting of each ether's flaws and virtues.
Annie will always be driven.
Shirley will always be giving.
Pierce will never apologize.
Britta's sort of a wild card from my perspective.
And Jeff will forever remain a conniving son-of-a-bitch.
Abed!
There are six sides to this die and seven of us.
He devised a system by which he never has to get the pizza.
Jeff!
- Really?
Dang, man.
- You crafty jackrabbit.
- Asshole.
- Pretty low, dude.
It's called friendship, look it up.
Encarta it.
I think we just found our pizza-getter.
Yes, we did!
Oh, like it matters who goes.
Ow!
What's so funny?
Karma.
That guy sucks harder than the toilet in an airplane bathroom.
Airplane bathroom Oh, my pies!
Roxanne Oh!
you don't have to put on the red light Ooh!
those days are over you don't have to sell your body to the night Sing, Britta!
I really love your place.
You should move here.
walk the streets for money you don't care if it's wrong or if it is right Roxanne you don't have to put on the red light You guys see what happens when I leave you alone, huh?
You don't have to put on the red light put on the red light put on the red light Go, Abed!
put on the red light put on the red light To Pierce.
May he rest in Pierce.
Shirley, don't you think you've had enough?
Of you.
Guys, I've been thinking about that night over and over.
One thing has become clear.
This is the darkest, most terrible timeline.
Enough with the timeline crap, Abed!
Pierce got shot in the leg and died!
Shirley's a drunk.
Annie's locked in a mental ward because her guilt drove her insane.
Jeff lost an arm in the fire.
Troy lost his larynx because, for some dumb reason, he tried to destroy a flaming troll doll by eating it.
Clearly you don't understand anything about defeating trolls.
Life has gone to hell, Abed.
This is real!
Look at us.
Look at me!
Britta, you put one wash-away blue streak in your hair.
And I lost an arm.
Exactly.
Life got dark.
And all because Jeff rolled a one.
Oh, I love how this is my fault somehow.
It's mine.
I've run over that night over and over in my head, and I keep coming back to one thought.
I should've caught the die and not let you roll it.
I failed to do that and we all suffered for it.
But I'm gonna make it up to you.
What is this?
Of all the timelines, this is clearly the darkest, which is why I propose we commit to being evil.
I made us all black goatees out of felt.
I suggest you put them on until you're able to grow your own.
From now on, I am evil Abed.
We're the evil study group, and we have but one evil goal.
Return somehow to the prime timeline, the one that I stopped you from rolling that die, then we destroy the good versions of ourselves, and reclaim our proper lives.
- Evil Abed.
- Mm-hm?
As evil Jeff, am I allowed to pull fewer punches with you?
- Certainly.
- I hate you!
Shut up with your Sci-Fi crap!
I lost my damn arm, and you're making fake beards!
Goatees.
evil Troy and evil Abed What's wrong?
I don't know.
I guess nothing.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Remember, you guys can have a deep too!
And don't be afraid to play with the Ruuubber spiiider!
I'll ask again Are you sure I can't bring anything?
I don't understand.
We're having a party, before we're going to the real party?
Sometimes, I think you young people are just making this crap up.
It's a pre-party!
It's informal, intimate, and just for us.
And I told you guys you didn't have to dress up.
Oh, we were wearing this when you called.
Yeah, when we dress up, you'll know it.
There's nothing in your playlist but spooky party, the Beetlejuice soundtrack, and NPR podcasts.
Ooh!
We could listen to one of those!
I have Michele Norris interviewing Errol Morris.
Don't worry, they address it.
Okay, let's make this quick.
I got three more polite appearances to make tonight.
What?
I'm one of the Fast and Furious guys.
Which one?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't watch that shallow crap.
I just pick a costume girls will like.
Jeff, can I have a quick conversation with you?
Doubtful, but I support the dream.
Remember last week, when I made you guys fill out those anonymous personality tests for my psych class?
Listen, if you dropped them in another puddle-- No, I processed the results, as per my assignment.
And, Jeff, one of our friends is Deeply disturbed.
Trick or Dean!
Don't forget to come by our Halloween scare-tacular dance, starting in the cafeteria at 9:30.
Also, I had the lights rigged to flicker because it's Halloween!
It's been happening for a week.
Halloween week!
So the lights will work on November 1st?
All Saint's day Month!
I'm sorry, you were about to get ridiculous?
Look!
One of the tests came back with 70 out of 75 red flags for an extreme personality disorder.
Extreme, Jeff!
Like a dorito?
A sociopathic dorito.
A cool ranch lunatic.
Only instead of Zest, Jeff, one member of our study group has Homicidal tendencies.
I think one member of our study group is an overzealous psych major.
You probably just Britta'd the test results somehow.
No.
I double-checked them.
Wait.
Are people using my name to mean "make a small mistake"?
Yes.
Give me some rope, time in a tree give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away Let's make this party fast and furious, in that order.
Yeah, I want to go to the dance.
I heard the Dean's got free taco meat from the army.
We can go to the dance in a bit.
But first, why don't we tell some scaaary stories?
Good!
I'll start with a story about a horrible fate befalling innocent people, and then I'm curious to get individual reactions.
Once upon a time, there was a couple in a car in the woods making out or something.
I think I heard something.
It's just the sound of my heart, baby.
Mmm.
An escaped convict from the asylum has escaped, and he's mental and he's on the loose and stuff.
Oh, my God.
That sounds dangerous.
Oh, I'm sure it's no biggie, but I am a horny man.
I'm only half-present.
He was last seen in the woods and has a thingy for a hand, a hook thing where his hand should be.
- You know what I mean.
- That sounds dangerous.
Fine, I'll get out and look.
But then I'm entitled to sex.
I'm getting stabbed with his hook hand thing.
Oh, my God!
No!
I was right!
And the woman was screaming and screaming and the man got killed.
- Abed?
- Yep?
How did that story make you feel?
- Embarrassed.
- That's an odd reaction.
Seems fair.
What embarrassed you about it?
I didn't care about the characters.
Didn't care about them?
They were stupid.
They deliberately put themselves in danger, and, when they were warned about it, the guy got out of the car.
Do you believe because he was stupid he deserved to die?
What the hell kind of party is this?
I suppose, from a creative standpoint, some characters deserve to die.
Ones that lack common sense or even basic survival instinct.
Your story's not scary because the characters are making choices the audience wouldn't make.
Plus, you need a smarter lead.
Here, like this.
It's a dark, cold night in the woods.
We establish a traditional log cabin, then cut to-- Here we are, a log cabin I rented so we could be intimate in safety, because it's not the 50s, so we don't have to park a car and neck at inspiration point.
That makes sense.
I'm turned on by how logical you are.
I'm comforted by your shiny hair and facial symmetry.
Well, I just brushed my teeth, so this would be the optimal time to kiss.
Enjoyable.
Soft lips.
Just the right level of moisture.
- Would you like to do it again?
- No.
We should listen to the news on this radio.
I brought it as a cautionary measure, because this cabin is within walking distance of the local insane asylum.
Oh, is that why you were able to rent it - at such a reasonable rate?
- Yes.
I hope you're as fertile as I am tonight.
- More.
- Ahh.
Abed!
Why are you doing the whole song?
They wouldn't turn the radio on at the exact moment of the most pertinent news broadcast.
It's too coincidental.
But I'll jump forward in time.
What was that noise?
Based on the news report we just heard, but not just just heard, I assume it's the deranged, hook-handed killer, who escaped when the asylum's antiquated security system failed.
I guess they shouldn't have cut corners, although it is understandable, given the recent economic downturn.
Should we go check it out?
No.
We should call 911 on my fully-charged cell phone, lock the doors, and then stand back to back in the middle of the room holding knives.
- I love you-- - Shh.
Ugh.
Did these people ever die or what?
Eventually, once it had been Eaaarned.
Well, Britta It looks like you're barking up the wrong tree.
Yeah.
You want to hear a scary story?
I've got a scary story.
Thank you for pulling me from that carriage.
I don't know what could have frightened my horses so.
Many vile creatures make these woods their home.
Some even warn of Monsters.
I don't believe in monsters.
I believe every man has good within.
I must retrieve my books from the debris tomorrow.
I am a schoolteacher, and many children rely on me to educate them.
Be gone, innocent one!
What's wrong?
You may choose not to believe in them, but I am a monster.
And I must feed.
Do not judge me for my weakness.
Stifle your slackened maw, you drained and tainted bitch dog.
I'm fine with this.
Ahh!
Wait!
Teach me to read.
Aww.
Wo Sound it out.
WoRd dog hates Cats.
"Oh reason not the need!
Our basest beggars are in the poorest things superfluous".
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
You should be proud of how much I've changed you.
Thank you for helping me, but I'm afraid some monsters cannot change.
No Resist your craving!
Just pick up a good book and read!
Your porcelain neck, in the light of the full moon, too appetizing.
Unfortunate For you.
You see, some monsters cannot change.
But others can.
What is this?
I'm a werewolf that feeds on selfish vampires.
And she ripped into his torso, like a gerbil shredding a quaker oats box, sending chunks of viscera and an aerosol mist of blood all over the skanky concubine.
Then, she flossed her teeth with his tendons.
And, because he was a vampire, he lived through all of it.
He had to watch her swallow his last eyeball.
She kept it attached to the optic nerve, so he could see down her throat, to his own partially digested flesh inHerStomach.
See?
There was a twist.
Wow, Annie.
I didn't know you were such a fan of Gore.
It's Halloween.
If you're gonna tell a scary story, - give it some texture.
- Wasn't that great.
Well, your texture was so discompassionately macabre, as if without the slightest regard for human life.
That's enough.
Stop pinning ribbons to her.
Why does Annie get to be good at everything?
You guys wanna hear a real, legit scary story?
Hello?
Is there anyone here?
I need help.
Oh, thank God.
An old doctor.
Me and my partner are top gun fighter pilots, the best of the best.
Pew pew pew.
Our F-15 went down in the woods.
I thought I heard something awesome out there.
Please, come in, for first aids and what have you.
Mmm, drinks from a stranger.
So medical.
Thank you.
Ahh.
Wakey-wakey.
What's going on?
This cabin is my lab, where I do weird experiments on people.
Look!
Noo!
Forced to be together forever!
I sewed you together.
I totally sewed you together!
Abed!
Now that we're sewn together, do we have E.S.P.?
Yes!
We're psychic now.
We can destroy him with mind powers.
Oh!
You tried to destroy us But you only made us More awesome!
No!
I'm a j-jealous.
Now you are the subject.
What?
What?
Tell me more.
We sewed your butt to your chest!
Ha!
Noo!
Wait.
Ha!
You fools!
By sewing my butt to my chest, you've given me boobs I can touch all day.
With what?
Noo!
No!
Noo!
Nooo!
Nooo!
Feet hands.
What did I do to deserve that?
Keep me out of your stupid stories.
I didn't say it was you.
I said he was a crazy, old, racist doctor.
Yeah, and I'm your crazy, old, racist friend.
I was, anyway.
Now I'm not so sure.
It's just a story, Pierce.
Yeah?
Well so is this.
Come back to bed, Magnum.
In a moment, girls.
I'm just enjoying an expensive, post-coital Brandy.
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
Whats we gots heres?
This is a home invasion, you jive mother.
Easy, easy, easy.
Nobody has to get hurt here.
Yeah, that's right, honky.
You take it real easy and give us all your expensive Brandy and hubcaps.
Okay, but Whoa.
Oh, man.
YouAre StillRelevant!
Oh, my God!
Unh!
Okay, I'm ready for my birthday spanking.
Which of you girls knows how to count to 30?
What in the hell Was that?
That wasn't even a ghost story.
It was like an episode of some show we're all too young to have heard of.
Fine!
Then I chopped up both your bodies.
So that was us, and you were Magnum?
Still am, Pakistan.
Wanna try me?
Guys, I think these stories are starting to get personal.
And so needlessly violent.
What happened to the days when ghost stories were about good versus evil?
Once upon a time Aw, man.
My drugs are wearing off.
- Who's got more?
- Ha ha!
Here you go, baby.
All right, all right.
That is my kind of pot bong.
Yo, Jango, check it out.
Swarms of locusts and tornadoes of frogs.
I don't care.
I lived in New York.
Ugh!
It's like New York out there.
We interrupt your death metal to bring you some heavy news.
All the good christians got raptured up to heaven, so if you're hearing this, the good news is you're the coolest people in the world.
Yes!
The bad news is the world is over.
This is NPR.
Aw, man.
End of days?
Could anything suck harder than this?
Hel-lo!
Devil here.
Just popping by with a little damnation orientation.
Here's the sched.
At 10:00, you'll be buried neck-deep in scorpions.
followed by pilates.
- Oh.
That's good.
- I like pilates.
Pilates is a demon that eats your genitals.
But first, stabby-stabby.
Ah!
For whom do ye cry out?
All the good people are gone!
Aah!
Whoa!
Look!
It's our friend we used to pick on for being Christian.
Oh, she looks great.
A righteous wind blows!
Off to pilates!
Thank you for saving us, Shirley.
I mean, your name's not Shirley, this is a story about strangers.
Anyhoo, can you take us to heaven now, please?
Ooh, I cannot.
I just came to say good-bye on my way to Abraham's bosom.
Bye.
I forgive you.
Gay marriage!
And he chainsawed them to bits!
Then he put 'em back together.
And then he chainsawed them again!
Forever.
Where was Jeff in that story?
And why was my name Jango?
Shirley, that wasn't a horror story.
That was a sermon.
You ruined a Britta party.
That's like letting poop spoil.
No!
Wait!
No!
No one can leave until we figure this out.
Figure what out?
Long story short, those psych tests I made you take came back.
Turns out one of you is probably a homicidal maniac.
That's stupid.
I have a responsibility, as a practitioner of the mental arts, to figure out which one of you is sick, and get you the treatment you need.
You're a danger to yourself and others in your current state.
We've known each other for two years.
None of us are murderers.
No, but one of you has the potential.
If we leave here now, do you know what might happen?
Britta, what are you describing?
What?
Who has those images like that in their head?
Probably the same kind of person that would make us tell ghost stories in order to secretly study our minds.
I'm just worried that one of you-- One of us?
You took that test too, right?
What?
What are you saying?
Oh, my God!
What if it is me?
Wait.
This is crazy!
We're getting freaked out because it's Halloween, we just need to settle down.
I'll kill you!
You don't want to be barium sulfated!
- Whoa!
- Stay back, psychos!
Or I'll slit your throats and bathe in your blood.
Whoa!
What has happened to all of you?
You heard all the stories.
Anyone here could be aPsycho!
Thinking that is what's psycho.
Here, I have a story that I think might help.
- Whee!
- Cheers.
Whoa, whoa.
Wait!
Before you do anything, tell us why you kill people.
Fear.
I kill because I'm afraid.
Somebody, please, give me a hug.
Aww!
Get in here.
Love hugs.
Love hugs.
Let it out.
It's okay?
You're welcome.
That was the gayest crap I've ever heard in my life.
Yeah, Jeff.
What the hell?
Why are you always so determined to have us relax and put down our weapons?
Maybe he's a remorseless madman with no empathy, who eludes detection by manipulating others.
Yeah, Jeff.
Maybe we should go through your test answers one by one.
It doesn't matter.
I filled mine out randomly.
- Oh, come on.
- What?
You idiot!
That was probably the test that returned the psychotic result!
Hmm.
Maybe.
Well, what kind of sociopath doesn't offer that information, like, an hour ago?
No, no.
I'm no sociopath.
I always know what I'm doing is wrong.
I'm just a guy that doesn't like taking tests, doing work, or getting yelled at.
So if you think about it, that makes me the sanest person here.
Boo!
Is this your test or what?
How should I know?
It's just a bunch of bubbles.
Wait!
Give me those.
Why are the scores on the bottoms of the sheets?
They should-- Britta, look at the arrow.
You ran these through the machine upside-down.
She Britta'd it.
Whatever.
I'll run them through again.
And you guys are gonna stop using my name to mean "making a tiny and understandable mistake".
So we're all insane.
Well, except for this person.
Is that one mine?
We should probably figure it out, right?
If one of us isn't crazy, it's only fair that the rest of us know who they are.
Or we could hold on to the comforting notion t-that any one of us m-might be sane.
Yeah.
Okay.
We learned an important lesson tonight.
We should never make the Britta of Britta-ing each other's feelings.
You're using it wrong.
Wow.
You Britta'd "Britta'd".
- Yeah, way to pull an Abed.
- I don't get it.
Shirley, don't Pierce.
I don't get it.
Do not get it.
Guys, it's been three days!
When are you gonna let me go?
At least say something!
Guys?
Guys!
Should we let him go?
HmmLet me think.
Nah.
More Brandy?
Don't mind if I do.
MmmThat's terrible.
Should we get back in our F-15 that we repaired with our mind power?
I was thinking the same thing!
I know!
Jinx!
Double jinx!
Triple jinx!
Troy and Abed sewn together
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Damn it!
Put the teethy wrench on the square thing and jiggle it left.
Thanks by the way, that square thing is a Hampton bolt and what you just described is a manacheck maneuver.
Hey, I'm just here for the tater tots.
Look, I know you think you made your mind up about plumbing and I respect that.
But come to the third floor men's room tomorrow any time after 3:00.
Unclog one toilet with me and tell me you don't feel something.
And I'll never bring it up again.
All rightOne toilet.
If it will get you off my back.
Abed, look.
Cool, Stonehenge.
Excuse me, are you Pierce Hawthorne of Hawthorne Wipes?
At your cervix.
Oh, sorry, I thought you were a lady.
You can use that cervix line if you want.
I told you it was him.
Would you mind signing this?
He's a big fan.
I got a pocket full of hawthornes pock-pocket full of hawthornes Okay, Randall, power down.
What was that about?
Fans of the product, I suppose.
In the wipes business we call them towel-heads.
I'm just impressed you got through a whole conversation with two gay men without doing this.
WaitThose guys were-- Mm-hmm.
I assumed they were just brothers or wealthy.
Why do you think they wanted your autograph?
This might be why.
It's Friday night I'm putting on my highest heels my shortest skirt my best device for concealing my penis and I got everything I need ow!
I got my body, got my lips got a pocket full of hawthornes p-p-p-pocket full of hawthornes Oh, my God, Pierce, your moist towelettes are a gay icon.
What do Hawthorne wipes have to do with the choice to be gay?
Well, according to Wikipedia-- Oh, myEven Bruce Vilanch?
Especially Bruce Vilanch.
That is copyright infringement and defamation.
I'm going to sue the pants off that lady.
- I don't think that's a lady.
- And why do you want his pants off?
Shut up!
I only wanted his pants off when I thought he was a lady.
So you were attracted to him?
The only thing I'm attracted to is taking him to court and eating his ass alive.
- Ooh!
- That's not what I meant.
Stop putting gay things in my mouth.
I got a pocket full of hawthornes - Pocket full of hawthornes - It's catchy!
I hope Pierce doesn't really sue that lady-man singer.
His life must be hard enough having to sew pouches in all his miniskirts.
Yes, I'm always nice to the gays.
They may live in defiance of God, but I'd die before I let a woman touch my hair.
Gay-oh!
Hey, what's going on with you bitches?
Bitches is gay talk for friends.
Did you sue Urbana Champaign for his t-shirt?
Not at all, I bought this.
I'm a fan.
Also, I'm a gay rights advocate.
I think I can explain.
Pierce's positrons have been negatized, creating anti-Pierce.
It happens all the time inspector spacetime.
Yeah, but anti-inspector had a funny mustache and was kinda rapey.
I don't think his positrons have been negatized.
That's exactly what Constable Reggie said.
No, I thought about it, and I decided a man should not be judged by what he does with a fellow man's butt.
- Here's the kick.
- Plus since that song came out, Hawthorne Wipes sales went up 7%.
- And it's good.
- Yep, even had my own people mock up a design for a new product line.
Hawthorne Pride Wipes.
They may cost more, but they're gayer.
And I'm gonna launch these little babies at a big party here at Greendale.
Here's a flyer.
Ooh!
Greendale's first annual gay bash.
Wow, Pierce, congratulations on meeting the minimum requirements for open-mindedness.
Yeah, I'm really proud of you.
You're growing as a person.
Oh, good grief, he's not supporting gay people.
They're supporting him.
If Mexicans were buying his wipes, he would have ridden in on a donkey.
People earning respect with money is the American way, Jeff.
Not that my father would have agreed.
It took a federal injunction to get him to sell these things to the Italians.
Oh, I see what's going on here!
In my psych class I'm learning about this thing called the edible complex.
All men have to kill their fathers so they can do something to their mothers.
I haven't finished the chapter.
What's that complex called where you're wrong about everything?
Huh, sarcasm from the man with the mother of all daddy issues.
Whoa, double diagnosis.
Save some for all those poor real doctors.
Pierce, what type of cookies do you want at the party?
We have peanut butter or chocolate chip.
Rainbow, bitches.
We can have peanut butter or chocolate chip.
Well?
It's pretty great!
Tight seal, good flow.
Kid's pretty handy.
You get the hell out of here!
Go on!
- Who was that?
- You listen to me.
What you have is a gift.
And some people are going to try to take advantage of that gift.
Promise me you'll use it for good.
All right, I promise.
Good.
Now, come with me to the second floor.
Somebody pooped in the sink.
You know, we actually have a lot in common.
We hate lesbians, we hate baggy pants, and I can't believe you guys are all bears fans.
- Super fans.
- Randall!
Somebody take a picture.
Come on Okay, now let's take a silly one.
- Okay, okay!
- All right.
Piercinald Anastasia Hawthorne!
Father.
We need to talk, boy.
Oh-- Gentlemen.
You are here tonight because you have been selected as potential candidates for the Greendale Air Conditioning Repair School.
But why kidnap you?
Why put a sack over your head and drag you here in the middle of the night?
Why is there an astronaut in the corner making paninis?
Simple, we don't want you to tell anyone about this.
And if you do, we don't want them believing you.
Isn't that right, Black Hitler?
Your initiation begins now, gentlemen.
Hey, guys, I'm looking for Troy.
Oh, he texted me.
He said he's fine, but he couldn't say where he is.
Oh, no, do you think he's been kidnapped?
Usually it's one of the parents, and it almost always ends in murder-suicide.
- Why are you smiling?
- I'm smiling?
Well if you see him, tell him Jerry's looking for him.
So Jeff, what are you going to wear to Pierce's gay party?
- Nothing.
- Ooh, they'll love that.
Ha ha.
I mean I'm not going.
It's dumb and I can't believe you guys are supporting it.
Everybody, this is my father, Cornelius Hawthorne.
Oh, I always assumed your father was dead.
Just mathematically.
Well, mom liked to pretend that was the case.
These are your friends, Pierce?
Hello.
Minorities, jewesses, and the unseasonably tan?
That is inappropriate!
And maybe you'll give that more weight since I'm "white".
You've got a wide brow.
What are you, Scandinavian?
Yeah, Swedish.
Swedish dogs.
Your blood is tainted by generations of race mixing with laplanders.
You're basically Finns!
Oh, my goodness, he's like the Abed of racism.
Okay, since no one's willing to ask, what's going on with your hair?
Ordinary toupee hair is harvested from the heads of the godless oriental.
Solid ivory is the only way to be assured of true follicular purity, while still identifying myself as a man of means.
I can excuse racism, but I draw the line at animal cruelty.
You can excuse racism?
So what brings you here?
I'm assuming it's not for your son's party.
Unless "segregationist mummy" is a gay fetish I'm unaware of.
Actually, uh, after discussing with my father, the party's off, and we're canceling pride wipes.
Stand up straight, Piercinald, when talking to the lower classes.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go find a half-decent ivory buffer in this two-horse town.
Oh, the party's cancelled?
I bought a cone bra.
Piercinald, please tell me you did not cancel your gay party because of your father.
It's a business decision, Jeff.
I took a look at the numbers, had someone explain them to me, and this is the way we're going.
I thought you said Pierce's idea was dumb?
Well that's before it was being oppressed by a-- - A father?
- A homophobe!
This isn't about fathers.
This is about a long-suffering community with a constitutional right to wipe whoever and whatever they want.
Well, if you like gay people so much, why don't you marry them?
!
This is so edible.
Britta, you are gonna make a terrible therapist.
And if you need to talk to someone about that, I don't recommend you.
Hmm, is that how your dad talked to your mom?
No, that's how he talked to your mom.
How does that make you feel?
Shut up.
Ah, Jeffrey!
Ah, I was so sad when Pierce said he was canceling the party.
And I was so happy when you said that it was back on.
Yeah, he's real busy with his dad, but I knew how much it meant to him.
I throw a pretty gay party, huh?
Yeah, it's great.
I mean, if you're into that kind of thing.
Time to mingle.
What the hell is this?
The gay bash, courtesy of Hawthorne Wipes.
I cancelled this!
And I uncancelled it.
My dad's gonna disown me!
Oh, no, then you'll be free of him forever.
You'll never have to cower at the sound of his voice or shudder when you see an elephant.
You're welcome, Pierce.
I just did what you never had the guts to do.
You know what?
Britta was right.
You resent my father because you've got problems with your own.
After "Britta was right", everything you said just sounded like a fog horn.
Then have your big gay party.
I'm out of here!
Oh, come on, Pierce, just have one drink.
You're gonna want to see the guest of honor.
Pull the cord, fellas.
Pierce, Pierce, Pierce!
Well, maybe just one drink.
Done.
Mr. Barnes Walk with me.
Mr. Barnes, air conditioning repair is an elite worldwide family dating back to the very beginnings of civilizations.
Our predecessors were slaves, fanning the pharaohs with palm fronds.
Over time, we became expert at making our superiors comfortable.
We made it our business.
And along the way, we learned to make ourselves comfortable.
No more palm fronds, Troy.
Now we are the pharaohs.
Breath print approved.
Feel that?
Actually, I don't feel-- Precisely.
Have you heard the expression room temperature?
Of course.
This is the room!
This is the room temperature room.
I-I can't tell where the air ends and my skin begins.
It's incredible.
That's what we do, Troy.
Incredible, invisible, inbelievable things.
We're an unseen, unknown, unvincible fraternity of craftsmen.
Graduates of this school are guaranteed lucrative employment for their entire lives.
And I'm inviting you to join us.
Will there always be paninis?
There is one catch, Troy.
Once you're in You're in.
Air conditioning repair will be your life.
A life of secrets you'll be unable to share with outsiders.
You will be an air conditioning repairman and nothing else Until the day you die.
I don't expect you to make a decision now.
Take 24 hours.
Cool.
I can't feel my pants.
Go Pierce, go Pierce, it's your birthday!
Well, congratulations, you got Pierce to symbolically kill his father by dancing to club music.
You of all people should be happy about this.
Pierce is becoming a more tolerant person, and it has nothing to do with his father.
Look at me now, dad!
Yeah, look at me now, dad!
Look at me now, dad!
Look at me now, dad!
- Hey, where you been?
- I'm not allowed to say.
- Are you Superman?
- No.
Would you tell me if you were?
I'd tell everyone.
I never understood why he cared who knew.
This is the hottest party we've ever had.
I know, it's pretty dope.
No, I mean, it's dangerously hot.
Our air conditioning system wasn't built for this gay a party.
I'll take a look.
- Tron?
- What's tron?
Ooh!
Man this party's a real sausage fest.
I knew it!
- Knew what?
- Don't play dumb with me.
What, did they promise you the life of your dreams?
You can have all that as a plumber too, but without the pretense.
Why do you hate them so much?
Because they're elitist.
They pump themselves up to make everybody think that they're special.
Because the truth is they're not!
I have a gift.
I'm special.
I'm not a loser like you.
I'm gonna eat Spaceman paninis with Black Hitler, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Well, you really seem to be enjoying yourself.
I've gotta say, I don't know why the word gay means dumb.
These guys are all right in my book.
Pierce Hawthorne, get your fine gay-lovin' ass up here and say something to your fans.
Come on!
If I tell you something, will you promise to keep it a secret?
Secret handshake.
Secret.
Okay, I know I said I can't talk to you about what's going on, but I can talk to myself.
Can you pretend to be me?
I like football, but also I don't-- Perfect.
Okay, I can't choose between air conditioning and plumbing.
I know, it's so hard, right?
- Let's ask Abed.
- Now you be me.
- What should I do, Abed?
- I don't know but Harrison Ford might know.
Don't get cocky kid-- Okay, this isn't working, okay?
Abed tell me what to do.
I don't really see the dilemma.
Plumbing and air conditioning seem more or less identical.
They're not--they couldn't be more or less identical.
Well, what do you feel like doing?
Honestly, I el like watching TV with you.
But they're making me choose, and if I choose wrong it could screw up my whole life.
If you really have to make a decision, I say go with whatever makes you the happiest.
Because, again, they're virtually the same thing.
I think I know what I need to do.
Don't get cocky, kid.
All right, bitches!
I just want to say this whole thing was a huge mistake.
Uh, Hawthorne Wipes is officially severing its ties to the gay community.
- Aw!
- What?
Effective immediately, it will return to being a straights-only product.
Boo!
Ahhhhhh Fake heart attack.
I taught him everything he knows.
So, how long you guys been on the force?
Pierce!
What the hell was that?
- That was-- - That was my boy.
Standing up for good old Hawthorne values.
All due respect, sir, I have zero respect for you.
- Typical Welsh nonsense.
- But father, I-- Pierce, you really wanna be like this guy?
He's wearing elephant bones on his head.
He will be what I tell him to be because I am his father!
Listen up, colonel crypt-keeper.
I could live a million years and I could spend every minute of it doing important things.
But at the end of it all, I would have only lived half a life if I had not raised a son.
This was a gift that was handed to you.
You squandered it.
And the reason you have so much hatred in your heart is because you're trying to fill a hole where your kid was supposed to go.
And now it's too late.
Now you're just stomping around trying to prove you exist.
Well, mission accomplished.
But here's a question I'd like to pass on to you from every son of every crap dad that ever lived.
So what?
I'm done with you.
He's done with you.
The world is done with you.
Come on in.
He's a Hawthorne.
This is what they do.
He's faking.
Pierce, listen, I just want to say-- Did you know that the Canadian Mallard is the only water fowl that bites his father's head off on the way out of the womb?
- That is definitely not true.
- I don't know.
I looked it up on the "wackapeediah" Pierce, um, I just want to say, you know Sorry for killing your dad.
Don't blame yourself.
He bought a lot of his organs from questionable sources.
Oh, here, he wanted you to have this.
No Pierce, you should take it.
Believe me, I'd love it.
But the terms of his will clearly state that whoever kills him gets to keep it.
Huh, I guess I'm up.
"Father, I'll never forget what you said to me "on my first day of school.
'Comb your hair, you idiot.
You look Greek.
' "I'll never know if that was true, "but I do know that I was too scared to stand up for myself.
"Well, I'm not scared of you anymore because you're dead, "and I'm not.
So, I win".
And you can suck it.
Dude just told his dead dad to suck it.
So edible.
You're the worst.
Your 24 hours has expired.
I need an answer, Troy.
Are you ready to join the elite brotherhood of guys who fix air conditioners?
I'm sorry, Vice Dean Laybourne, but, I realize no one's better than anyone else.
I mean, some people are better at sports and And there are magicians, but I was put on this earth to do something else.
So you're going to be what?
A plumber?
No, I'm not gonna be a plumber either.
Because they have to deal with poop.
My decision for now is to watch TV with my friend.
You're making a huge mistake, son.
That may be, sir.
But at least it's my mistake.
It doesn't change the fact that it's a mistake.
Doesn't it?
No, it doesn't.
Sir, looks like there was a malfunction in the cafeteria last night.
The Amana 5000 had a compound coil fracture.
But it was fixed.
Very funny.
Not even I can fix a compound coil fracture overnight.
But he can.
Constable Reggie.
Inspector Spacetime.
This isn't over, Troy Barnes.
It's only just begun.
You know what, I was wrong.
I think you'll make a very good therapist.
And why is that?
Well, you really nailed Pierce in that whole oedipal thing.
The guy's got some serious father issues.
Don't you think you may have had some oedipal issues as well?
Not really seeing the connection.
You literally killed a father.
Yeah, well, not mine, dummy.
Wow.
Hey, Winger.
You going home alone?
Gay.
That was close, Constable Reggie.
I thought those blorgons had us dead to rights.
What on bitter earth do they want from us, inspector?
The question's not what they want from us, constable.
But when!
Inspector, look out, blorgons!
Eradicate!
Eradicate!
EradicateEradicate Take that, blorgon scum.
How old are you guys?
The question isn't how old we are But when old we are!
In your face, blorgonian!
Pew, pew, pew, pew!
'Sup, girl?
How you livin'?
Pew!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
I'm so glad you're moving out of this neighborhood Annie.
Some dude peed on my car while I was parking it.
Oh, you met spaghetti!
- Yeah, I won't miss him.
- Speaking of missing people, how did Jeff dodge this bulletOf friendship.
He said he was under the weather.
- Pshaw!
- Thanks for helping.
Can you imagine how much fun this is gonna be?
Me living with Troy and Abed?
Yeah, there'll be a honeymoon phase, but it won't be long till you hate their guts.
What's this whittle guy's name?
I'll never hate Troy and Abed.
Oh, my God, I forgot.
You're 20.
Don't worry.
It's natural.
When you become roommates with friends, the things you love about them become the things that make you want to smother them with a pillow.
But That's unacceptable to me.
ThenI'm lying?
Forgetting something?
Yeah.
Yeah, like I'm gonna get sick of this.
Wh-what wh-what?
We're here to help you move on the dance floor.
- Nice!
Tweet it!
- Tweeting it.
- What are you tweeting?
- Everything.
We're live tweeting Annie's move on Twitter.
Hashtag #Annie'sMove.
How fun.
How was I supposed to know it was a handicap space?
Because the man in the wheelchair was yelling it.
Oh, yeah, and he doesn't have an agenda.
Hold it.
- Where's Winger?
- Sick.
Pshaw!
Yeah, I'm calling him.
Hello?
So you're sick, huh?
That's what they tell me.
Cut the wit, Winger.
Where are you, The Gap or Banana Republic?
Well, Britta, you got me all figured out.
Well I can tell you're not in bed.
That's right, Britta.
I'm pretending to be violently ill to avoid lifting a few boxes.
Because I'm 13.
And who's your primary care physician, Mr. Winger?
Uh, Dr. Schroeder.
S-c-h.
Um, do you want to see my insurance card?
Please.
Wait, are you at a hospital?
No, I'm at The Gap.
You hear that?
That's not a heart monitor.
It's a machine telling me I'm low on khakis.
Dr. Tarpenian to radiology, Dr. Tarpenian.
Crap, I- I'm sorry.
I just assumed-- Whatever.
I don't blame you.
I've lied before.
It's probably karma that I'm sick.
But believe me, if you had what I have, you'd rather be moving boxes.
Okay, feel better.
Sorry.
Yeah, I'll see you guys on Monday.
You are fantastic.
So are you.
What are you doing after this?
Probably trying a couple of boot-cuts.
But after that Maybe, like, a blazer?
Give me some rope, time in a tree give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away How are we out of packing tape?
I don't know.
I think I left some in the bathroom.
Nope, uh, nothing in here.
You guys!
You used all of it?
I had a big breakfast.
Nice.
Tweeting it!
Okay, there might be a slight danger I will end up hating them.
Man children Can't live with them, can't leave them alone with your tape.
Britta, don't make jokes.
You're bad at it.
Also, I can't afford to live anywhere else.
And everything is riding on this, and I'm out of tape-- Annie, listen.
Breathe.
When I was in Amsterdam, I met this guy who ate too many shrooms and fell out of a window at the Anne Frank house.
Oh, no, no, he's fine.
The doctor said that the drugs made his body just limp enough to keep him from breaking his neck.
Britta, I don't see what your taste in men has to do with my situation.
What I'm saying, Annie, is that if you're gonna live with two guys like that, you've gotta learn to go limp.
Loosey-goosey.
Shake it all up.
- Limp - Loosey-goosey.
Okay New Annie.
Going with the flow.
Loosey-goosey-- Is it loosey-goosey or goosey-loosey?
Is that hyphenated?
You know what?
Don't tell me.
I don't need to know.
BroHeim.
Okay, go.
- Aah!
- Didn't feel it.
What a fun use you found for my bubble wrap.
I know!
We have to sell this to the military.
Yeah, baby.
Yah, babuh.
Here's the other tape gun.
Think fast!
Ooh!
You broke my pluggy thing.
No worries.
That's what the security deposit is for.
Hashtag #ThatIsAll.
Oh no, you're not letting some slumlord take your hard-earned money.
I'll fix it.
I used to do that kind of thing all the time - when I was a slumlord.
- Really, Pierce?
My landlord's coming by to do the inspection at 5:00.
Do you think you're gonna have it done by then?
Easy peasy, George and Weezie.
This is probably the last that'll fit in our car.
I'll help you.
But not in an uptight way.
I'm very concerned about this living situation.
I mean, I've seen enough episodes of Friends to know that cohabitation leads to sex, drugs and something a parade magazine called Schwimmer-fatigue.
Good for you, Shirley.
What's the saying?
If you can't stop 'em, judge 'em?
Well, somebody's gotta be this group's moral compass.
And that somebody has to be you, right?
Because by moral compass, you mean Shirley's religion.
Well Want a ride?
Well, if this is a forecast of the conversation, I will ride with somebody else.
Don't worry, Shirley.
Keep me company while I fix this and I'll give you a ride over there.
Britta!
Well, hey there, stranger!
What a coincidence, huh?
This is just like that, uh, Lake House movie.
I can only assume.
Even I have limits.
Dean Pelton.
Jeff, it's Saturday.
Call me Craig.
Off campus, I'm just a craigular Joe.
Ooh, what'd you get?
Ah, now I feel like I have to head back out there.
Dean--uh, Craig, it's nice to see you but I actually have to run.
Oh, yeah, you're probably heading to help Annie move.
Right?
Oh, I follow Troy and Abed on Twitter.
Looks like Annie's moving and you're Sick at the hospital?
Curious.
I might head there myself.
I could tell them you said hi.
I'd rather you didn't.
Well, maybe I won't have time.
Especially if we're doing Lunch?
Yeah, but your religion isn't the same as morality.
And calling me amoral because I'm atheistic is religious persecution.
How can I religiously persecute you?
You don't have a religion.
Oh, look!
A hitchhiker.
A person in need.
Oh, my God.
What am I doing?
I'm pulling over to help him out.
Do not help him out.
Why, because it proves the existence of secular morality?
No, because he looks stinky.
Judge not, Shirley.
Judge not.
I really appreciate it, thank you.
Where are you headed, fellow human?
Riverside Falls?
That's 40 minutes away.
Oh, I guess I'm just a really good person.
I knew you were.
I could see the kindness in your faces.
I assume you've both accepted Jesus Christ as your lord and savior?
Oh, that's nice.
Ow!
Needed a coat of paint anyway.
Welcome, Annie, to your new home.
OkayTo reacquaint you, there's the bathroom, kitchen, and, of course, our bedroom.
And if the room's a rockin' please come a knockin' because there's something probably terribly wrong.
Yeah, we're pretty chill in there.
Mm-hmm, now let's go see your room.
What's that?
That is your room.
You said this was a two bedroom.
It is, one, two.
Yours is a blanket fort.
An awesome blanket fort.
But still highly flammable so no candles.
What do you think?
- Tweet it?
- Tweeting it!
I am not surprised you're so taken aback.
This apartment is where dreams come true.
We spent our whole lives being told that blanket forts are only for special occasions, like sleepovers or when uncles die.
But that's a lie, Annie.
You can live in a fort of blankets all day, every night.
It's so awesome.
I'm surprised you guys haven't chosen to live in one.
Well, we'll be spending enough time in yours.
I mean, it's where we're gonna watch tv.
Right.
Uh, what's that door over there?
That's not a bedroom?
- No.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Is it a linen closet?
Something like that.
What's a linen closet?
A siesta salad and an iced tea.
Excelente.
And for you?
Ahem.
- The gentleman - Oh will have a top notch-os and a watermelon Margarita.
Thank you, Jeffrey.
So, any brothers or sisters?
And we'll take the check too.
Oh!
What's the rush?
We're eating lunch, and then I'm leaving.
Okay.
I just hope that I don't bump into your study group on Monday.
And I pray they don't ask me who I saw at the mall on Saturday.
Because, unlike a certain someone, I just don't think I could lie to those sweet people.
Dean, this is blackmail.
Ah!
Call me Craig.
And call blackmail "a day at the mall with Craig".
Because that's all I require, Jeffrey.
You and I are going to have some fun.
And create a few memories.
And I suggest you get into it.
Because that counts.
A song for the seÃ±or, seÃ±or?
AdiÃ³s amores.
Oh, what a surprise.
Mmm!
Jeez.
This is actually quite calming for some reason.
And that's when I realized I had to forgive them.
That's a beautiful story.
So inspiring how he came to find the lord.
- Isn't it, Britta?
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, I didn't exactly have to find the lord.
He was inside me.
Amen!
What's your name, friend?
- Jesus.
- Oh.
Are you Latino?
No, my child.
I am him.
You're what now?
I am the one true son of God.
I was sent here to save humanity.
Oh, no.
Well, it is a pleasure to have you in my car, Jesus.
Britta, stop.
It's not funny now.
Hey Jesus, just curious, what's your position on marijuana?
It was given to us by God.
It should be legal.
Oh, that's nice.
Hear me, hear me!
Presenting the real-life fairy tale of how princess Annie was saved from bad neighborhood forest by woodsman Troy.
And Bebad, his emotionally unavailable unicorn.
Brought to you by the girl-yogurt Jamie Lee Curtis uses to poop.
There's a package of it in the fridge as a welcoming gift.
Now, once upon a time there was a beautiful princess named Annie.
Hi.
Who was harassed every day by Count Spaghetti.
The evil cracksmith who lived outside of her building.
Whoa!
I just stand here?
Oh, come on, Jeffrey.
Get in here!
This is gonna be fun!
Or else.
So we just punch in the numbers?
That's right.
Okay, you know this one, Jeff.
We've sang it a thousand times together in my mind.
Huh, huh?
Oh come on, Jeffrey.
Make or break time.
Unless you want to be back here next Saturday.
There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea you became the light on this dark side of me and now that your Rose is in bloom a light hits the gloom on the grave Jesus loves marijuana Jesus loves marijuana Amen.
Jesus loves marijuana and drinking human blood, oh baby I compare you to a kiss from the Rose on a grave ooh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah now that your Rose is in bloom a light hits the gloom on the grave Ah!
That was great.
Yeah, might have been a little fun.
Huh, see?
And you emailed your therapist that you wanted to be alone this weekend.
What?
Hmm?
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Now, with your permission, I'd like to sing a little song about race-mixing.
This one's called "Don't You Do It".
Get out!
Ah, good evening, senator.
Any requests?
What do you want to do next?
I paid for a full hour, so-- I email my therapist from my Greendale account.
The same account where I received an email from physique25 telling me about today's sale.
Is that why you're at the mall?
You read student emails?
Oh, oh, now the patriot act says I can do it, Jeffrey Technically.
Need I remind you the nation is at war-- Ow!
- I'll kill you.
- No, Jeffrey, no!
Jeffrey, Jeffrey come on!
Just remember, we were making memories!
No, Jeffrey, no!
Aah!
No, Jeffrey!
No, no, it's too violent!
You're scaring me!
Don't let the terrorists win!
And then the three of them lived happily ever after!
And Bebad became the little dipper.
The end.
- Kiss me, woodsman Troy!
- Mwah!
You guys!
Living here is gonna be fun all the time.
Let's make the entire apartment a fort.
I'll get more blankets.
This is a space we reserved for virtual adventures.
Like a playroom but only works in our minds.
We call it the dreamatorium.
Butit's a bedroom.
No, no.
There's only two bedrooms, including the blanket fort.
This is the Dreamatorium.
All day, I've been jumping through hoops to fit in.
Including the literal hoops you put in front of the toilet.
- Yes.
- And you guys are hoarding this second bedroom as some kind of playroom?
And making me sleep on a pile of laundry?
Hey, we worked hard on that.
And it's a blanket fort.
It's an asylum for half-witted children!
As the only adult in this apartment, I am making an ultimatum.
Me or this Stupid dreamatorium.
Dreamatorium is non-negotiable.
Read the lease.
Especially the part we added in crayon.
You don't wanna take this to court.
Trust us, this place can be a courtroom in the blink of an eye.
This doesn't work for me.
From the minute I joined the study group I've been worried about how uptight I am and how I'm no fun.
And then I was worried that I wouldn't fit in here or be able to hang with you guys.
But you know what?
Why don't you ever ask yourselves whether you can hang with me?
Why am I always the one that has to adapt?
I'm sick of this crap!
Enjoy your stupid dreamatorium.
We will!
Because this is our apartment too!
And just because we're awesome doesn't mean we're not adults!
Candy cigarette?
I don't want a candy cigarette.
- I want our Annie.
- Yeah, we blew it.
I picked the wrong week to quit.
What the hell is this?
In security deposit terms, it's a gold mine.
And you're lucky it's only gonna cost you money.
Your friend nearly killed himself.
Yeah, that's me.
Lucky Annie.
I'm really sorry, Annie.
I had some island girls over and one of them must have slipped me a Mickey.
I'm just glad you're okay.
You can pay me back by helping me get all my stuff from Troy and Abed's.
You're moving again?
How long was I out?
Is napster still a thing?
You've been out long enough for me to realize that I'm gonna need to keep living alone.
Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.
Oh, what the hell?
I have brain damage.
Nothing I do counts.
Where is all my stuff?
Troy, Abed?
It's all yours.
We're sorry.
Sometimes we get stuck in our own little world.
And then in that world, we make even littler worlds.
And sometimes there are tunnels between those worlds.
Or a subway.
One time a snake.
We're sorry.
Do you like it?
Of course, I do.
It's perfect.
I mean, I can rearrange the throw pillows.
You have them arranged by size instead of color, but-- What did I say?
But what about the dreamatorium?
Oh, it's staying.
The dreamatorium is more important than any of us.
But you're more important than our bedroom, so we put the bunk bed in the blanket fort.
This is all gay code.
You sure I'm worth it?
Yeah, there's a couple of things that we were hoping that you'd help us with.
Yes, like where does the water go in the iron?
And what's the iron for?
And what gets out kool-aid stains?
Yeah, we already know that the opposite color kool-aid doesn't work.
Also, Troy scraped me when we were fork-jousting last week and I don't think it's healing right.
- Oh, Abed, that's infected.
- Ew!
Infected.
That's the word I was looking for.
- Hi, guys.
- I thought you were sick.
I wasn't.
I kind of made it up to get out of helping.
Oh, that's okay.
- It is?
- Yeah, it is.
Oh, hey, Jeff, did you know that when it snows my eyes become large?
and the light that you shine can be seen He tweeted it?
- baby - He tweeted it!
A kiss from a Rose on the grave and now that your Rose is in bloom a light hits the gloom on the grave - Oh, look out, asteroids!
- That was close.
Thanks for getting us to planet Greendalia safely, horsebot 3000.
- Well-- - Oh, no!
Greendalia has been overrun by evil King Blorgon!
- Look out, Troyborg!
- Pew pew pew!
Ah!
I'm dead.
Horsebot 3000, no!
I love you!
I am King Blorgon.
And my plan is to blow up the world!
Your lasers are useless against me.
Aim for his butt.
It's his only weakness.
- Pew pew!
- Bam bam!
- Aah!
- We did it!
Peace and tranquility have been restored to Greendalia.
And all thanks to horsebot 3000.
He belongs to the stars now.
All right, five more minutes and we should probably put a stop to this, right?
Jeff, are you-- I liked horsebot 3000.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Why did I come to Greendale?
So I can keep my job and get busy with my education.
To meet different people.
Because Greendale's a slam dunk.
- So why should you-- - Why should you-- Why should you go Greendale?
That's easy.
Greendale has the most advanced typing class in the southwestern Greendale area.
And now you can register by fax.
Go Greendale, go Greendale, go!
That, as you probably know, is the currently-running commercial for our school.
Yeah, I always see it during late-night marathons of Fantasy Island.
That's not an accident.
It's the result of intensive targeting.
But now, Greendale's School board has given me a budget of $2,000 to update our little ad.
Are you sure it should change?
I chose Greendale over city college because of the way that one dude goes Ah, okay, okay.
You know I love to be seen agreeing with you, Troy.
But this is our chance to make Greendale's most reasonable dreams come true.
And I need your help-- All of you.
That's okay, Jeffrey.
You can say no.
This school asks very little of its students.
It mainly gives.
I feel like you guys might know what I'm talking about.
How can we help?
Oh, thanks for asking.
I've chosen you, Greendale's brightest, most coincidentally diverse, hispanics not withstanding, study group to star in our commercial.
- Ooh.
- Pick a character.
We start this weekend.
Oh, we get to be on tv!
But if we're shooting this weekend, why are these cameras here?
Abed, true to form, has decided to do the weird thing and film a documentary instead of helping.
As a student of character, I have a feeling that trying to make this commercial may cost the dean his sanity.
And my camera follows the fire, not the smoke.
Ever seen Hearts of Darkness?
Way better than Apocalypse Now.
What's the catering sitch going to be on this picture?
This isn't Hollywood, Pierce.
If it was, these glasses would be tinted, and I'd be friends with Stevie Nicks.
No catering.
This is outrageous.
I'm not leaving my trailer till there's food.
You don't have a trailer.
Well, then, I'll rent a trailer.
And I won't leave it till I have the one I don't have.
I'm an actor, not a circus freak.
Oh, no.
I needed to go that way.
Eh, I'll loop around.
Give me some rope, time in a tree give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away All right, let's rehearse this mamajama.
Does everyone know who they are?
Where's my script girl?
It's supervisor, and I'm right behind you.
Thank you, supervisor girl.
Faster than a locomotive.
A script supervisor is the person that tells everyone to stay on script and keeps careful notes to prevent logical inconsistencies.
So basically the star.
We open on a typical day at Greendale, only the students all look happy and you can't smell that smell.
Troy?
"Why do I go Greendale"?
"With three kids at home, you better believe every penny counts".
"To meet different people".
And then, you and Troy hug-- if you're comfortable with that.
- Of course.
- Yeah, Troy and I are buds.
Best buds.
Air buds, even.
Feeling stupid.
And then, the camera pans, and enter Dean Pelton.
I got stuck with the role of the dean.
So I'm going to show him how much of a dean I can be.
And I've got a feeling I won't make the cut.
Welcome to Dean-Dale community colle-dean.
I'm a silly goose.
Honk, honk.
Dean-a-Lee-doo.
- Look at me.
- Stop.
This is my sister's outfit.
Jeffrey, stop.
You've hit gold.
Save some for the screen.
All right, people, scene six is up first.
Oh, and I don't think Pierce is coming back.
Can someone fill in as the pencil?
Pierce Hawthorne, screen of stage and star, will not leave this trailer until he gets a trailer.
And then I'm not leaving that trailer until there's catering.
And I'm not eating the food until-- And action.
Why go Greendale?
Just because, just dean it!
Dean machine.
Got dean, got much, much got-- And cut.
Oh, a star is born.
I suggested to the dean that we shoot my scenes in front of the Luis Guzman statue because the dean has no legal right to broadcast Guzman's image, which means every shot will be unusable.
I even put a call in to Guzman's lawyers to alert them.
I'm always willing to go the extra mile to avoid doing something.
Like sex with women.
Shut up, Leonard, you smell like mentholyptus.
What are you even doing here?
I'm thinking about breaking into the tv game.
Since it's apparently sticking around.
I don't want to wake up in 30 years and wonder "what if"?
"Because this full-time mama ain't breaking the bank with your expensive tuition".
Okay, cut.
Shirley, the voice.
Can you make it, um-- I thought it would be more s-- What's another word that means happy/threatening?
The worde's looking for is "sassy".
He better pray he don't find it.
As soon as we get this shot, we are done.
- Your phone is ringing.
- Oh.
- Dean deaning.
- Dean Pelton?
Hey, man, how you doing?
It's Luis Guzman.
I hear you're making a commercial for Greendale, and you need permission to use my face or something?
Well, I, um Uh Well, why not use the real thing?
I'm sorry?
I'm saying, I'd love to be in your commercial.
Wowee!
A real big-time celebrity wants to be in my commercial.
Wowee.
A real big time celebrity wants to be in my commercial.
- Come on down.
- Yeah, that's cool.
But listen, I've got to finish this movie, so, you know, I can't come for a couple of weeks, all right?
Mr. Guzman, Luis, thank you.
And can I just say, I loved you in-- Innnnnnnn IMDb.
See you soon, man.
That was tragic.
The students here mean well, they really do.
But what Greendale has always needed is a miracle.
This is it.
This is how I get to put Greendale on the map.
You know, I thought this commercial was going to be okay.
Well, guess what?
It just officially became great.
Let me give you a little rundown of this commercial's great elements.
Luis Guzman is in it.
I'm sorry, will you excuse me?
Everyone gather 'round, quick announcement.
Come on around.
Everything that we shot so far is worthless.
I've thrown it out, and we're starting over tomorrow morning.
- Why?
- Because Luis Guzman is in the commercial now, so Yeah.
For realsies.
Everyone, go home.
I'm rewriting all of your parts.
Except for you, Jeffrey.
You have locked into something here.
And the only thing your character needs is more screen time.
It's great that he got a celebrity, - but why reshoot everything?
- Perfectionism.
The dean's first step down a road that ends in self-destruction.
That sounds Horrible.
Actually, I might end up taking this to some festivals.
The dean's production has taken over the entire school.
Classes are shut down.
The quilting club is being forced to sew costumes.
Two females, both 5'10", one brunette, one with asthma.
He's also using the P.A. system for casting calls.
Okay, everyone-- Does everyone have their new script?
Uh, it says I'm supposed to be a book reading a book.
That--that doesn't make sense.
What's this?
Scene four.
Last night, I had an epiphany.
I'm ready to step this mother up a notch.
This commercial is going to push every button, starting with the one that is so hot, it will sizzle your finger-- racccccce.
And action.
"To meet different people".
Cut!
I'm coming in.
I am trying to pull a 400-year-old dagger out of this nation's heart, and you two are hugging.
Her, I understand, but you?
What did I do?
You didn't.
Let's take it again!
"To meet different people".
Again.
"To meet different people".
I need more!
More!
Wrong!
Fight the power!
Fight it with your hugs.
Tear down those walls.
Okay, you get this wrong one more time, I'm segregating the school.
"To meet different people".
You can't even do it when we're helping you!
Somebody help her!
To meet different people!
Stop saying I'm different!
Dean, we've spent Maybe it's time to move on to something else.
I'm in Psych 101, and even I don't know what's happening.
The dean is going insane and taking all of you with him.
If you know that, then do something!
I'm doing everything I can.
I only have so many cameras.
- Oh!
- Aah!
I've spent an entire day in this thing for no reason.
What if the shoot drags on for another day?
Or, God forbid, two.
And action, and move.
"This full-time mama ain't breaking the bank--" Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut--Garrett, you're not taking advantage of the motion capture technology.
You have to move.
I forgot what I am again.
Oh, for crying out-- you are a microscope!
No, that's a toilet.
No, that's clearly a frog who can't get out of a box.
Jeff thinks he has it bad?
As Jeff's understudy, I have to wear my Jeff wig on top of my Chang hair and then my bald cap on top of that.
There's no air getting through here.
I'm literally dying.
But you'll never hear my story.
I mean, now you heard it, but That was close.
Are you sure you can't work a little faster?
Nobody asked for perfection.
Well, perfection is what you're getting.
And if you don't like it, you can fire me.
Yeah, if we don't like it, at this point, we definitely will fire you.
Good.
That's how I like it.
Ha!
I'm surrounded by assassins.
By own school's paper has turned on me.
But when this is all over, I'll have a commercial with Luis Guzman in it, and all they'll have are their words and their fears and whatever embarrassing photos they can get from my two-faced mother.
Garrett, I've got two men in diapers here.
I know one of them is playing the dawn of a new era in education, but I've got nothing on the other one.
Oh, um, just a guest of the dean's.
Well, both of you go that way, then.
The dean had his seventh epiphany today, which has given me an epiphany of my own.
The dean is a genius.
He has to be.
If he isn't, I've given almost two weeks of my life to an idiot.
That is unacceptable.
Therefore the dean is a genius.
And I will die protecting his vision.
Are you by any chance familiar with Stockholm Syndrome?
Is it something that the dean created?
Because if not, I don't care.
We all wanna go, but the dean won't let us.
I think Pierce played this the smartest from the beginning.
He's probably at home watching Forensic Files and eating cheesy popcorn.
Well, about time.
Hey, that's for Luis Guzman.
Well, when you get me my trailer, he can have it back.
And make it as nice as this one.
Hey, Dean.
Dean?
Hey, Dean!
Pierce mistook me for the dean today.
- I want windows.
- How did that make you feel?
I've become a stranger to myself.
I'm bald now.
I've always been bald.
I merely dreamt of having hair.
And now the bald man is awake.
Jeff?
It's time.
Lights, camera, Dean.
Action.
Why go Greendale?
Just because!
Cut.
Cut.
Lose the bald cap.
- What?
- I don't like it.
It's hokey, it's fake.
Take it off.
No.
I beg your pardon, actor?
I have worn this stupid thing for 12 days.
I have made bald friends.
Well, that's your mistake.
Because it's a lie.
It's Hollywood crap.
And I won't allow it in my commercial.
You're not bald.
Yes, I am.
Well, then, you're wrong for the part!
Understudy!
That's it.
That's reality.
Winger, you're done.
Go home.
Go home.
Okay, I don't know why, but this is the last straw.
As a licensed psychology major, I am declaring this production a violation of human rights.
You have made us prisoners of your insanity.
Shut your face, Britta.
If the dean wants his role to be played by a Chinese man in a blond wig-- Oh, my God, you are insane.
All right, I'm sick and tired of hearing complaints that I'm forcing people to be here.
Anyone who doesn't want to help me can leave!
- Abed, stop!
- Okay.
Keep rolling.
Hello?
Hello.
Hello?
Hello, it's me.
Luis Guzman.
- Hello!
- Hi.
Hi, Mr. Guzman, Dean/Director Craig Pelton.
Sorry, I've been editing.
It's a ltle bit of a mess.
What the -- is that?
Oh, that's a possum.
Once you spend some time with them, you see they're just like big, gentle rats.
- Who's the guy?
- I'm no one.
That's Abed.
He's a little bit odd.
Now, without further ado, here is the commercial you will be staring in.
Why do I go Greendale?
- Aah!
- What's in the box?
OhhOh I've got to make a phone call.
I had to tell this dean I couldn't do his commercial.
He didn't take that too well either.
Y'all gotta help this dude.
I mean, aren't you his friends?
I'm more of a fly on the wall.
What is go-- what?
You won't be in my commercial, but you'll be in his stupid documentary?
All he does is follow people around.
Yeah, but haven't you seen Hearts of Darkness?
- Way better than-- - I want you the hell off of my campus, you ungrateful backstabber.
I already got rid of your trailer.
I had a trailer?
Can anyone hear me?
I will walk off this production.
I will quit!
Hello?
I come here to shoot this commercial for Greendale.
That's what you had written on the script.
Ugh, that script was terrible.
I thought it was pretty good.
Of course you'd think that.
You went here.
Oh, I get it.
You're worse than crazy.
You're ashamed of your school.
And that--that statue of me out there, that's just wrong, man.
Well, the bronze adds ten pounds.
- Nah, man-- - It's not going to be perfect.
Screw you.
I'm just saying, don't worship the people leaving Greendale.
Worship the people that are here.
Worship this place.
It changes people's life.
Look, I loved my time here.
I got laid like crazy.
That's way before Boogie Nights too.
Look, this is a special school.
You don't deserve to be here.
Are you still filming, Abed?
Yeah, but try not to address me.
I'm not really here.
Neither am I. I don't think I can finish my commercial.
But I think I know how your documentary ends.
Hi, I'm Craig Pelton, Dean of Greendale Community College.
I have failed this school.
I have failed it because I thought I was better than Greendale.
See, I went to a university, so I thought it was my job to improve this place.
But it turns out that the only thing wrong with Greendale is that it's run by an insecure wreck who holds five dances and two talent shows a year because he's afraid that the school isn't good enough.
But Greendale is good enough because it accepts me for what I'm not.
Greendale is the best school in the entire world, and I'm so sorry what I've done to it.
And I'm sorry what I've done to the ice cream machine.
Aah!
Please, no one eat out of it until you clean the nozzles.
The janitor knows how.
I'm horrible.
I'm horrible.
Gentlemen, what I'm about to show you is not the commercial you paid me to create.
What I am about to show you is a glimpse into my mind and soul.
Please hold your questions until the end.
I know you will have a lot of them, but I'll understand if you'd rather I just leave.
Why do I go Greendale?
The dean is a genius.
To meet different people.
With three kids at home, you better believe every penny counts.
I loved my time here.
I got laid like crazy.
So why should you-- Why should you-- Why should you go to Greendale?
Greendale is the best school in the entire world.
Go Greendale, go Greendale, go!
It's good.
Y-you know what, better than good.
Good enough.
Is there any more of the crazy Chinese guy?
He pops.
I'm confused.
That's not my commercial.
I-I didn't make that.
Yeah, yeah, okay, Zemeckis, it moved through you.
Anyway, congratulations.
That should last us another 16 years.
So, uh, what's next?
- Chump's rusty bucket?
- Quarter taps.
- Did you do this?
- You did mostly.
You got the footage you needed on the first day.
I added a little bit of my footage to fill in the gaps.
I thought you were a fly on the wall.
Some flies are too awesome for the wall.
Documentarians are supposed to be objective, to avoid having any effect on the story.
And yet we have more effect than anyone.
Because we decide to tell it.
And we decide how it ends.
Will your story be yet another sad one of yet another man who just wanted to be happy?
Or will your story acknowledge the very nature of stories and embrace the fact that sharing the sad ones can sometimes make them happy?
Ugh.
Before you say anything Nope, I've got nothing.
Can you just forgive me?
Yep.
Why?
Because we've all been there.
Which is why we're all here.
Aww!
I'm a good Dean?
Yeah.
Can someone help me get a live possum out of my office?
We could do that.
It just keeps jumping and skittering.
And you think you're prepared, and then it skitters again.
Okay, scene's over.
Hmm?
They'll be ready for you in 20 minutes, Mr. Garland.
Great.
I'm a star!
Give me that.
I will not be mitigated.
Okay, you know what?
I'm not coming out of this trailer until I get a new trailer.
And get me a granola bar!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Happy Friday, everybody.
What are you doing this weekend?
The question is, who am I doing this weekend?
He's asking because he's already forgotten.
It's nobody.
I'm volunteering at the animal hospital.
- Aw.
- Animal hospital?
The animals are the patients.
That makes sense.
Yeah, Dr. Zizmor's letting me work off the cost of Daniel's eye surgery.
Wait.
You won't spend money on a name-brand phone, but you got lasik for your geriatric cat?
He only has the one eye, Jeff.
I can't exactly buy him a cat monocle, can I?
It's pretentious.
And for your information, this is a totorola.
Troy and I will be having a very special Saturday night, as in Dark Knight.
It came!
Our limited-edition, $299 Dark Knight DVD with bonus footage, special commentary, and a Christian Bale autograph, including a personalized message of up to four words!
"Abed is Batman now, Christian Bale".
- It's official.
- From the man himself.
May I have that back, Annie?
Thank you.
And just to clarify, if you see this lying out, I'm still using it, so you don't have to take it to the kitchen, dump it out, and wash the bowl.
Is this about your buttered noodles?
I didn't say that.
- Yes!
- Into your face!
Your tears reveal your weakness!
What is it with those tools and foosball?
- They've been at it for weeks.
- I think they're European.
It's probably a more important game over there.
Foosball's like the soccer of ping-pong.
- I can't take it anymore.
- Oh, Jeffrey, let them be.
Gentlemen, my name is Clarence Thaddeus Foos.
My grandfather, Fletcher Morton Foos, invented this game for one purpose-- to have the loudest, dumbest thing happen.
Now it has.
The game of foosball is completed.
You're free to return to your undoubtedly hearing-impaired families.
Tell you what, we'll stop playing, if you can score a point on us.
Tempting, but then wouldn't I be playing foosball?
And, if so, how would I not be a loud, weird knob?
Free shot.
I'm not even touching the foosenschaften.
Sorry, luftballons.
I'm above it.
Boo-yah!
I wish there was a word to describe the pleasure I feel at viewing misfortune.
'Tis the face of a broken man.
Jeff.
Smile.
- Uh, uh - Ooh!
They, uh, -- they come in a six-pack.
Give me some more time in a dream give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away Oh-- Buttered noodles.
I'm allowed to throw out the dust, right?
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I-I Why?
- I stepped on it.
- Why?
- I was dusting the tv.
- Why?
I can run out and get a new one before he gets home.
Oh, sure, Annie.
And--and then we just have to record fake exclusive commentary by Christian Bale.
Go ahead, you first.
This scene was a special challenge - to all involved-- - Stop it!
That's not a real option!
The disc is irreplaceably awesome!
What if we got a different disc, and-- Annie, do you know how many sitcoms have done the "secretly replace a broken, priceless item" thing?
'Cause Abed does.
Abed knows everything, and I know you think you can think your way out of this with your "thinkiness," but don't think too much.
You just have to confess.
- Okay?
- Okay.
We shot this scene on location-- Okay, he's right.
It won't work.
Jeffrey?
What--what are you doing?
Hmm?
Oh.
You know, I just thought Next time those deutsche-bags try to show off, maybe I can catch them by surprise.
Jeff, you don't need to worry what foreigners think about you.
That's your birthright as an American.
Okay Small confession.
I used to love foosball.
It was a great after-school game for a lonely kid with no dad-- you know, just masculine enough without having to know how to throw or catch.
I have seen you throw.
And it was fun Till I started getting bullied by people like those Germans.
So I quit.
Well, you did the right thing.
Foosball is a vile game for vile people.
Shirley, you wouldn't get it.
It's a guy thing.
It's not a fresh-baked-pie thing.
Well, I might get it a little.
You don't know me.
HoLyCrap.
All right, I think I figured out the viewing order-- original version, director's cut, director's cut with commentary, and then original version cool-down.
- Yeah, we'll see.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God, you guys.
We've been robbed!
Oh, man.
I can't believe we got robbed.
Shirley, Shirley.
You have to teach me.
Please, help me beat those evil power krauts.
Don't you get it, Jeff?
They're not evil people that are good at foosball.
They are good at foosball because they're evil.
It's an evil game that brings out the worst in us, like--like out-of-town weddings where the reception's in the same place as everybody's rooms?
Great.
After three years of religious advice and carb-laden pastries, you finally have one thing I actually need, and-- I'm sorry.
Um, that was rude.
It--it shouldn't be so important to me.
I'll, uh I'll see you Monday.
Jeff Tomorrow, dawn-- be in the student lounge.
Shirley, you are the best.
Dear lord, please forgive me.
And please have mercy on him.
The stakes have never been higher.
Shut up, Leonard.
I found your YouTube page.
What's the point in reviewing frozen pizza?
You're talking about it.
Well, that is true.
Now, Jeffrey The key to winning foosball is to tap into your darkness, so I need you to promise you won't judge the side of me that might come out.
Shirley I'm gonna be perfectly blunt with you.
The few times that you've been a little bad are the times I've liked you most.
- Really?
- Remember making fun of Britta's boyfriend's tiny nipples?
Oh, yeah, they were tiny.
Remember what you did to Pierce's hoagie?
That was so disturbing, I almost proposed on the spot.
Now, come on, show me how to dominate.
All right, Winger, hands on the grips.
I'm coming up on your right side in three, two, one!
You know why you can't stop me?
'Cause I'm not playing a game.
For you, it's winning and losing.
For me, it's life and death.
That's how I win.
That's where you have to go.
No more thought, no more feeling.
Kill or be killed.
Kill or be killed, little man.
Think back to when this game mattered, before you got to be too cool.
Stop acting like you're not ashamed right now.
Follow that shame to the fear.
Follow that fear to the rage.
You put that rage-- aah!
Up your ass, Turkey.
Ha ha!
There's only two ways off this table-- kill or be killed.
- Say it.
- Kill or be killed.
I said say it, mumbles!
- Kill or be killed.
- Kill!
- Kill!
- Kill!
Kill!
Yeah!
You called me Turkey.
I love it.
Sorry we couldn't get a car over here until now.
Our captain was killed on duty last night.
My God, I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
Good man-- leaves behind two kids and a pregnant wife.
So you're missing a Batman DVD?
My Dark Knight extended extended cut--it wasn't insured.
Well, there's no sign of forced entry on your door or windows.
You sure it wasn't just misplaced?
Someone definitely broke in.
Some of my jewelry's missing.
You sure about that, Annie?
Mm-hmm.
My necklace.
It was gold-- white gold-- with emeralds.
And my name engraved in Hebrew.
It was a bat mitzvah gift from my Nana.
She was a rockette.
She married a count.
He was blind.
He loved her for her mind.
That's good color for the report, but I got to be honest, small stuff like this almost never turns up.
- Oh, no, Abed.
- We'll be in touch.
Say You look familiar.
Did I ever pretend to shoot a guy in front of you to teach you about gun safety?
I'm really good at faces.
Well, I guess the only upside to this is it's brought us closer together as roommates.
Something doesn't add up.
If there was no forced entry, it had to be an inside job.
- We don't know that.
- And instead of taking cash, pharmaceuticals, laptops, they take what?
My Batman DVD, and one piece of oddly ornate Hebrew-themed jewelry?
- Nana gave it.
- It's smoke.
- It's a ruse, a lie.
- Hmm?
I think I know what happened here.
Abed, I-- The landlord did it.
It all makes sense.
Rick has keys to every apartment--means.
He knows when we're coming and going--opportunity.
And he was dressed as the Joker for Halloween--motive.
- Hmm.
- Something's got to be done.
Oh, let's not leap to thing-doing.
Right, Annie?
Double strike.
Got it.
Back blast.
Boom!
Viper shot.
- Nailed it!
- Oh, look How cute-- you do like foosball, you just have to practice with your mama.
What are you guys doing here on a Saturday night?
Shouldn't you be making weird art movies - or well-engineered cars?
- You take that back!
We came to play.
Get away from our table.
- We're using it, strudel-brain.
- Nice.
Then play us for it.
Fine.
Monday morning-- only let's make it interesting.
The losers never get to use this table again.
Oh, you are so on that things have now become very much like Donkey Kong.
We're gonna kick das butt.
- Nice.
- Thank you.
Enough teutonic punnery.
Monday morning you get this Were you guys walking around with a soccer ball just so you could do that?
They left the ball and everything.
I think they were literally walking around with it like a prop to use.
That's, like, a $25 dollar bit, and it's not even that good.
You have got to come clean, okay?
I don't know what he's doing in there, but it feels dramatic.
I'm sure he's already moved on to some other obsession.
Oh, look, fun.
The police are powerless.
I must take justice into my own hands.
Men like Rick operate above the law.
But there's something else above the law Bats And me.
Abed, don't do anything drastic.
Yeah, maybe we should all just take a step back and-- Aw, is that the grappling hook I got you for Christmas?
The night beckons.
Its black fingers curl and uncurl, going, like, "hey, come here".
Abed, wait!
Wait.
I did it.
I stepped on your DVD, and it broke, and I staged a break-in to cover it up.
If that were true, you would've come forward a long time ago.
You're lying to keep me out of danger.
But there can be no peace while crime spits and dances on the grave of justice to the hot beats of infectious rhythms of all that is wrong.
- Oh!
- Just - Use your foot.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
You're okay--okay.
Ooh!
Abed - Oh!
- Oh!
Troy!
What are we gonna do?
Now you're open to input?
I'm following him.
You moving in here was supposed to tone us down.
So, Shirley, tell me-- how does someone with your talent for foosball ever stop playing?
Oh, I don't want to talk about that.
Oh, come on, we're, like, best friends now.
Don't back away from this.
Open up to me.
Okay, well When I was a kid, I had anger, Jeff-- real bad anger-- and foosball was a release.
But I didn't just-- just beat people.
I-I broke 'em.
One time I was running this table over at this Y.M.C.A across town, and I was really giving it to this kid-- this skinny little white boy, no offense.
He started crying.
They always started crying.
But something about this boy made me want to take it all the way.
I started jabbing him with the rods until The boy peed himself.
Everybody laughed.
I laughed.
But after that, the game lost its flavor.
Once you make a boy pee his pants, you start thinking about where your life is headed.
Jeff, what's wrong?
Gonna kill you!
Your ass is mine!
You're such a punk!
You like being beat by a girl?
Yes!
What are you crying for?
Your mama cannot help you, and I know your daddy ain't around, or you wouldn't play like a bitch.
Ha!
Ooh.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Is that what I think?
I just beat this kid all the way to tinkle-town.
Tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town.
Tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town.
You were Big Cheddar?
Who told you that-- Oh, dear lord.
You're tinkle-town?
Don't call me that.
All your fake sweetness and religion is just a veil covering a horrible monster.
And I had a lot of Mountain Dew that day!
There's an 80 percent chance you can't leave Woodstock until you bone these hippies.
Oh, boy.
Aah!
You know what I came for, scum.
Where is it?
In the closet.
In the closet, man.
- Abed, stop it!
- Get him!
I mean, stop it.
They're in the closet.
I knew I'd get caught.
Just don't hurt me, Batman.
Closet.
Women's shoes?
But Rick doesn't have a wife Or women's feet.
Wait.
My summertime ballet flats?
I thought I lost these in the move.
Is it there?
Does he have the DVD?
- The what?
- The DVD.
He has it, all right.
And it looks like he broke it.
Ah.
Who are you?
If you had something to say, why not put it in the text message?
I wasn't sure what to say.
Do you understand what you did to me Big Cheddar?
Please don't call me that.
Why not?
It's what you are-- a mean, nasty bully.
I was 12 years old.
I peed!
I had to change schools.
I changed everything-- my clothes, my hair, my personality-- because of you.
What a waste.
I wish I could take a picture of you right now and send it to my ten-year-old self.
Watch it, Winger.
You don't have a trademark on self-pity.
- I will defend myself.
- Good.
Bring the cheddar Big Cheddar.
I'm gonna put you on the express train back to tinkle-town!
- Argh!
- Uh!
Uh!
Aah!
- Uh!
- Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Ah!
- Die!
- Never!
Argh!
Argh!
Ah!
- You get it.
- No, you get it.
You're the one that needs the advantage.
Wrong.
Wrong!
Every game I ever won, I won fairly.
Foosball was how I measured my value as a man.
You took that away!
Why do think I had to?
You try sprouting three feet just when boys are about to look at you.
Everyone stopped liking me.
This game is all I had.
- It's all I had.
- Well, that's stupid.
You're a perfectly fine person.
So are you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry, Jeff.
You don't have anything to be sorry for, Shirley.
So Rick has agreed to stay out of your apartment as long as you stay out of his.
And I'm getting tired of saying this to people, but these things wouldn't happen if you'd invest in a simple shoe safe.
That's it?
Now we just live upstairs from this Guy that's really into footwear?
Sweetie, you're a renter.
Look forward to owning a house.
Be glad he's not into heads.
Thanks for your help, officer, and if you should ever need me, I usually get out of school around 4:00.
This guys sleeps outside your room, though, and that's okay?
Uh There's one thing I don't understand.
Why would Rick deny taking my DVD?
And why break it?
Well, maybe he stepped on it by accident and felt really, really, really bad.
All the more reason to confess.
Well, not everybody's perfect, Abed.
Batman.
And I am.
Well, Batman, on behalf of all of us that aren't perfect, can I just say I'm sorry I broke your DVD?
Apology accepted.
But I wouldn't mention it to Abed.
That guy's pretty ruthless.
And that's coming from Batman.
Hey, guys.
Abed, where have you been?
Troy, really?
Let it go.
Aw, black in the house!
- My hand is cramping.
- It's fine.
Oh.
Hey, freudenkatzen.
Ready for your schpankin'?
Just like we practiced?
Let's shut 'em down.
Ha ha ha.
Let's dance, David Bowie.
Get the ball, Karl.
I'm trying, and stop yelling at me.
Stop being such a schvine!
Aren't you guys playing foosball?
We've played enough for one lifetime.
We're gonna go see a movie.
Since when are those two so close?
Hello.
This is November 29th and I'm Leonard, and today I'm reviewing.
Eugenio's four cheese frozen pizza.
That's $5.99 at Kroger's.
I've tried it before, and we'll see.
Mmm!
Mmm, the cheese is good.
The sauce is good too.
Mm, well, it's definitely a buy.
Eugenio's four cheese frozen pizza-- a buy.
See you next time.
I'm as high as hell and you're about to get shot
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Wow.
They found a way to make the human being even creepier.
Covering him in icicles.
I think it's festive.
Yeah, my favorite Christmas tradition is trimming the hellraiser.
Guys, I found something we can watch together for Christmas this year.
The long-lost 1981 Inspector Spacetime Holiday Special.
Run time two and half hours and so critically reviled that after it aired, the creator has his knighthood revoked.
That sounds terrible.
I want to watch it twice, but I'm spending Christmas with my relatives.
Or rather, I'm spending the day with my relatives while they refuse to acknowledge Christmas.
You Jehovah's Witnesses-- so severe.
Andre and I will be spending Christmas giving gifts to the more persuadable of our Jewish friends.
I wouldn't call an unannounced visit from your pastor "a gift".
And don't bother this year.
I'll be at the movies with my bubbe.
You're not taking both of them?
Well, one's dead.
- What?
- I was looking forward to hanging out with you guys this Christmas.
This semester has been so long and dark and angry.
I was thinking we could have some light-hearted fun as a family.
I think what we've learned, Abed, is that attempts to make the holidays brighter tend to give them a certain darkness.
Oh, I don't know if I agree with that.
Deck the halls with boughs of holly Actually, maybe I do.
Heads up.
Glee club.
All: 'tis the season to be jolly fa la la la la la la rock on!
Merry Christmas, Greendale.
Glee club here, reminding you that our Christmas pageant is coming.
Next stop, regionals!
I said deck Please tell me we were not this obnoxious the year we filled in for them.
T-minus five seconds till hip-hop remix.
Four, three.
Come on!
Re-re-re-remix!
Re-re-re-remix!
Fa la la la la f-a l-a come on whoo You're awfully quiet, Jeff.
Nobody hates glee club more than you.
Today I'm just content to sit back and enjoy the show.
And now our pop music mash-up!
Elton Lil' John Lennon!
Glee club girls: Kick it!
Hey, tiny dancer!
Okay!
Stop!
Cease and desist.
Glee club, meet ASCAP, protecting musical copyrights since 1914.
It appears they have received an anonymous tip that unlicensed material was being performed here without the artists' permission.
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Glee club just became history club.
My soul is dead!
Oh!
Okay, if anyone asks, we were never here.
Why?
Give me some rope, time in a tree give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away The glee club is at Westside Hospital, recuperating from a collective nervous breakdown.
This is the second glee club we've lost in two years.
We might have to cancel the Christmas pageant.
And to think they were this close to regionals.
What the hell are regionals?
They're this close, Pierce.
Anyway, an old friend wants to talk to you.
Your favorite glee club instructor, the dreamy and boyish Mr. Cory Radison!
Oh!
Uh, I thought I told you to call me Mr. Rad.
Or Cory.
Just don't call me "late to dinner".
Unless you're serving brussels sprouts!
I won't, I promise!
This guy's like human froyo.
Look, when the last glee club died in that bus crash, you guys stepped up.
And you were the best gosh darn emergency substitutes I've ever worked with.
Both: Aw!
Well, this time I'm not gonna kid you.
I won't be easy.
- Oh!
- Your best Won't be good enough.
And ten times your best will be so bad, I will yell at you.
But I promise, if we dig down-- - Pass.
- All: Yeah.
Okay.
Whew.
Don't you hurt him.
Mr. Rad!
I feel like we let Mr. Rad down.
No, he let himself down when he left the house this morning wearing a sweater-vest.
I guess we did have fun last time.
Did we?
I can hardly remember.
It's all a weird, happy, musical fog.
Yeah, it was almost like being on ecstasy, only instead of having pointless conversations and dancing like idiots-- wait.
It was exactly like being on ecstasy!
That's what worries me about this guy.
He is equal parts hanson and manson.
Nobody let him corner you until he is out of recruitment mode, or next thing you know, we'll all be caring about Christmas pageants and Regionals.
- You're right, deal.
- Ugh.
- Agreed.
- Got you.
What the hell are regionals?
What are you still doing here?
I thought I'd give her one more tinkle before I took down decorations.
No glee club means no pageant, means no Christmas.
I'm sure trying to make things brighter just would've made more darkness.
That sounds like a certain ex-lawyer talking.
I see a lot of myself in you, Abed.
You care about your friends, and you wish they cared more about each other.
That's not an easy position to be in sometimes.
I just want my friends and I to have a merry Christmas together.
Well, maybe you could start by giving them the greatest Christmas gift of all.
What's that?
Glee!
It's a feeling you get when your brain finally lets your heart get in its pants Glee!
It's like a drug that you use that turns pain into shoes and your shoes into dance How's your piano still playing this song?
Glee is the answer when questions are wrong you'll understand if you just sing along 'cause glee is the gift that you need Glee is what I'll spread to my friends like a virus that sends them to a healthier place Glee!
I'll understand every scene because they'll sing what they mean instead of making a face families are closer when families are winning everything's cooler when cameras are spinning Both: singing and dancing in unison in-inning glee is the gift that we need Glee!
Thank you, Mr. Rad.
Don't break down the set yet.
I'm gonna try to get my friends to be in the Christmas pageant.
Thank you, Abed!
Thank you.
Merry Christmas, Troy.
Abed, you look gleeful.
Troy, don't you think it might actually be fun, doing this Christmas pageant for the glee club?
Abed, we hate the glee club.
Yeah.
I guess I just like liking things.
Abed.
Look, you know I'd do anything you did, but  I'm a Jehovah's Witness.
We're not supposed to celebrate Christmas.
I've been thinking about that.
I may have a loophole.
What if you were a Jehovah's Witness that was merely pretending to be into Christmas, gathering clues and blending in to take down the holidays from within?
You mean like a spy investigating, making it seem like I'm celebrating, when actually I'm infiltrating Santa's operation?
- Yoip!
- Going deep cover past enemy lines making everybody think I'm on the Christmas side rocking warm sweaters, hanging big-ass lights if the fat man can see me, yo it's gotta look right I'll watch all the tv specials that I never could I'll even cry during the sad ones, like James Bond would and when the big night comes, it's time to set the bait cold milk, hot cookies Both: decorative plate and he'll come down the chim-in-ey and it will be just him and me but he won't know we're enemies 'cause I'll play sincere, spring a trap like that, hug him tight, get on his lap and tell him he can come back every year 'cause I am Jehovah's most secret witness so I might have to dedicate my life to Christmas and act just like I love it till the day I die A-b-e-d connoisseur of Christmas on the spectrum, none of your business talks to fast to comprehend just wanna do right by my friend if years were seasons, this December would be the December of our December more blueprints than Howard Hughes but if they are blue prints, how do we choose?
we have to be happy to get to the end we have to save Christmas to save our friends Both: we have to save Christmas to save our friends we have to save Christmas to save our friends Hey, guys.
Rapping?
- Yep, wanna join us?
- Totally!
Wait, you guys never let me rap with you.
Well, we're gonna need all hands on deck if we're gonna go to regionals.
Cool.
I just need to Study ThoughIn my room.
So have fun!
And then, this morning, I could hear them in the bathroom, doing country Western mash-ups.
And they won't stop talking about regionals!
Maybe it's nothing.
Yeah, if "nothing" wears a sweater-vest and seems aggressively asexual.
Come on, let's all study for our biology final in our old-- Where's our table?
Who's that guy?
You guys all see him too, right?
- Hey, guys.
- Merry Christmas, y'all.
Sorry about the rearrangement.
We need this space to rehearse for the pageant.
But we're not doing the pageant.
Look, guys, I hear your negativity, but also, can I counter with this?
Who hates glee?
Listen to how that sounds.
Glee literally means "glee".
Oh, stop it!
Not liking glee club doesn't make us bullies, and implying that is reverse bullying.
Good point.
Sing about it?
All: No!
I understand them, but you, Pierce?
Your generation invented music!
I don't know about "invented".
Perfected, maybe.
Pierce!
They're just trying to pander to your demographics' well-documented historical vanity.
Resist!
Abed, wasn't Santa Claus himself part of Pierce's peer group?
I believe so.
Both: One, two, three, four.
Santa Claus was born in 1945 He had a boogie woogie Coca-Cola army jive and when the commies gave the polio to Doris Day Santa helped the Beatles chase McCarthy away that baby boomer Santa he's never gonna die Santa fought at Woodstock and Vietnam and smoked a ton of acid and burnt his bra and then in 1970, he did more drugs and his hair stayed long and he grew a mustache Both: baby boomer Santa he's gonna stay Ali-I-I-ive Santa invented Spielberg and microchips Santa invented Coca-Cola and aerobics he made the iron curtain and the Gremlins 2 fake butter and AIDS and Twin Peaks!
Both: baby boomer Santa thank you for MTV Ow!
Ow!
baby boomer Santa thank you for everything You're welcome You're welcome for everything in the world you're welcome you're welcome for all that I bring to the world I'm baby boomer Santa I bring the gift of the world baby boomer Santa I'm an American pearl - Pierce is on board.
- That's great!
For the Christmas queen, I'm hoping we can get Shirley or Annie.
They both have really strong voices and natural vibrato.
- There's also Britta.
- Britta's adorable!
So Shirley or Annie for the Christmas queen.
There's a leaf on Britta's head.
She's playing a tree!
And it's gonna be so fun!
Mr. Radison, who authorized you to rearrange our study room, and who do you think you are anyway?
I'll tell you.
Well well well I'm scared to go into the study room.
There are so many top hats in there.
I wish there was a way we could stop all this.
I mean, I realize the stakes aren't actually that high, but somehow, that just makes it extra scary.
I know.
Jeff, I think I know what Mr. Rad is up to.
There's something you have to see.
Mr. Rad plans to get every single member of our study group to join the glee club.
Well, I don't know how he thinks that's gonna happen.
I'll show you.
Wha--?
This is just one of the many costume changes I'll be doing during the show.
We're a shoo-in for regionals, right?
Annie, you too?
This is beneath you.
You are an intelligent woman.
Also, you're Jewish!
I guess I have a lot to learn about holiday tradition.
Teach me how to understand Christmas show me how to open a box it hurts my little head when I'm lying in my bed with visions of sugarplum socks Is this a bit?
Teach me how to understand Christmas do I trim the tree or the deer?
I can't keep it straight and now it's getting late where does the stocking go?
here?
I can't see!
What's a Christmas Eve?
is that Santa's lady?
are snowmen cold or hot?
won't you be my daddy?
I'm a silly Christmas baby tell me what to deck  'cause I forgot - Annie.
- Ooh!
"Bwain" hurt-y, understand-y "cwistmas" mistletoe for eat-y, taste good"?
You smarty, me dumb help "pwetty" have fun boopy doopy doop boop sex Look, eventually, you hit a point of diminishing returns on the sexiness.
What's a dimin-- ?
- Stay back, old man.
- Don't even hum.
Shirley, Britta, I have no intention of singing.
Good.
I can't speak for these little angels though.
Oh!
Choir: there's a magic in the air around us we all have the sudden urge to bake it feels like a very special birthday but whose name should be written on the cake?
Mm!
Shirley, you need to get out of here!
Choir: we asked our public school to give the answer They're not gonna tell you.
Choir: but they could only teach us not to pray That's what they do.
That's what they do.
Choir: the constitution says the state can't tell us was anyone important born today?
Oh, gotta tell the babies!
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ is the lord Happy Birthday, Jesus Choir: Happy Birthday cut the cake, cut the cake now cut the cake, my lord Oh, Jeff, thank God!
They got Shirley!
It's just you and me now.
Jeff?
Guys, I am swelling with pride!
You stepped up, and you saved the Christmas pageant!
Whoo!
And it's all thanks to you, Mr. Rad.
I just hope we can repay you by making regionals.
Uh, I thought this was regionals.
Don't let my confusion undercut their importance.
Places, everyone!
Scooch, scooch, scooch, scooch, scooch.
I could not have done this without your recruiting skills, Abed.
I was happy to do it.
For a while there, I thought we were gonna end the semester on a really dark note.
I'm glad we're singing and dancing together instead.
This has been a good time.
And it's going to continue to be a good time.
If we win regionals, then it's straight on to sectionals.
And then a week later is semis.
Then semiregionals.
Then regional-semis.
Then national lower-zone semis!
Oh.
But I kinda thought this was You know, just for Christmas.
No, no, no.
This is forever.
This is what we do now.
This is who we are.
- Fa la la la la - Fa la la la la - fa la - Fa la la la la - fa la la la la - Holla!
All: we are planet Christmas when we sing we will sing together throughout everything - we are planet Christmas - Britta.
Is this about regionals?
I just talked to Cory, and he needs you to be the mouse king instead of me.
Me?
But I'm supposed to be a mute tree.
- It's an emergency.
- Hmm?
This will help us get to regionals!
I knew it!
Wait, what are the lyrics?
- They're in your heart, Britta.
- Right.
Duh doy!
Glee club: we are everyone, and we are everything  Christmas time!
What the--?
Oh, Britta's in this?
I got a Christmas time for me I got a Christmas time for a tree - No!
She's ruining it!
- Christmas Christmas time me so Christmas, me so merry No, stop, stop, stop, stop!
What are you doing?
Get off the stage!
I'm singing my heart's song.
Get off the stage, and never sing again!
You are the worst!
Hey!
You do not get to call Britta "the worst".
- Yeah!
- Let her finish!
Mr. Radison, I think it's fine.
I know Greendale is an all-inclusive school.
Why don't we let Britta sing her awkward song?
Yeah!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
This show is supposed to be gleeful and bright and fun, and you can let me do that, or there can be another bus crash!
Well, figuratively.
I'm not saying, "I killed the last glee club".
I'm saying you not listening to me is like metaphorically cutting the brake lines on your own-- look, kings of Leon!
What did he say?
Did Mr. Rad kill the last glee club?
And to think I trusted him enough to captain a magic carpet in that dream I had last night.
Maybe Jeff's right.
Maybe forcing things to be bright just makes the darkness underneath even darker.
This was all my fault, insisting we do the pageant.
Sorry.
Merry Christmas.
I guess I'll just see you guys after the holidays.
Happy time day, Reggie.
It is tradition to give one's constable a gift at the end of each orbital cycle.
Oh, thank you, inspector!
- Blimey!
A hologram?
- Mm-hmm.
Let's activate it and view the performance.
I tried to find a way around then get behind your wall I tried to reach the top This is terrible.
Study group: the angels did say was to certain poor Shepherds in fields where they lay in fields where they lay keeping their sheep on a cold winter's night that was so deep We decided we wanted to spend the holiday together.
It's been a dark semester.
I basically killed a guy.
And I kind of attacked you guys with a fire axe.
Yeah.
I'm thinking about seeing a new shrink.
- What?
- Don't.
Holy crap.
Look how terrible this Christmas special is.
Children's choir: Noel, Noel Noel, Noel we will see you after regionals Merry Christmas!
Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean  Chang, Chang, Chang, Chang  Pop, pop, pop, pop  My name is Alex, my name is Alex, my name is Alex my name is Alex   Merry, merry, merry, merry "Chang-mas" Merry, merry, merry, merry "Dean-mas" - Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean - No, no, no, no, no, no!

- Dean dong
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
mmm.
Ugh.
Hot 'n' brown's coffee really wakes me up to the fact that its coffee sucks.
I miss having a coffee shop.
Now where am I going to get my cappuccinos and Sarah McLachlan CDs?
It wasn't that great.
If had this space, I would have served fresh fruit and sandwiches, and I would've got rid of that take-a-penny, leave-a-penny nonsense.
If the good lord wanted you to have a penny, - you'd have one.
- Pierce Why do you look like a wealthy murderer?
I look like an entrepreneur.
Now that my dad's gone, I'm expanding Hawthorne industries by investing in new products.
- Like these.
- What's that?
It's an automatic security camera that can tell your friends from intruders.
How does it work?
Your guests have arrived.
Threat level four.
Your guests have arrived.
It's not calibrated.
Wireless racism.
The future of the past is now.
Why don't you put your money into a good idea, like Shirley?
Oh, I made that offer the first day I met her.
She almost broke my nose.
I mean, Shirley's good with food, you have capital, and Greendale has real estate.
What are you talking about, Britta?
I'm talking about the whole reason you came here - To start a business.
- Hmm.
What do you think, Shirley?
Should I have my people call your people?
I mean, not your people.
I could think about it.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh is Shirley Bennett in the house?
Bop motownphilly back again the year was 1991.
Ah-ooh Andre, what are you doing here?
Oh!
Boys ii men, going on not too hard Spring fling dance.
See, that's where I first laid eyes on Shirley Edwards.
A vision in hyper color and hammer pants.
Baby girl, I have loved you ever since there was a Soviet union - and only one Damon Wayans.
- Oh.
Baby, I know I've made mistakes, but I'm so happy we've made it through.
But there's one thing, something important, that we keep putting off.
Oh.
Will you, Shirley Bennett, marry me, Andre Bennett, again?
Yes, yes, again!
Shall I notify authorities?
Give me some rope, time in a tree give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away it's cool that Andre and Shirley are getting married again.
There's a whole generation of viewers that didn't get to see the original.
Let's hope it's more of a bale than a Kilmer situation.
Second weddings are okay, I guess.
If I had to rank 'em, uh It would go fourth, seventh, second, fifth, first, third, sixth.
- No, wait first then fifth.
- Got it Fourth, seventh, second, first, fifth, third, sixth.
When's our culture gonna outgrow this wedding thing?
You're anti-wedding, now?
No, she's just pro-anti.
No to everything you both said.
Weddings are like little girls' tea parties, except the women are the stuffed animals, the men are making them talk, and they're not drinking tea, they're drinking antiquated gender roles.
Somebody tell Britta what an analogy is.
I know what it is.
It's like a thought with another thought's hat on.
Hmm.
Look, I can't get behind this marriage thing, either.
It was invented back when "till death" meant "till your first cold".
I mean, life's too long to spend it with someone else.
- It's a sucker's game.
- It's a mutual cop out.
I mean, just nut up and die alone.
- Mmm.
- Hello.
Oh, my God, we're so happy for you!
- You are glowing.
- I know, isn't it exciting?
The rehearsal is in two days, and the wedding is the day after that, on our anniversary.
And I'm sure you all can make it, because you're already here.
You're having your wedding in the study room?
Our church has certain policies regarding things like second weddings, and tight jeans and Calico cats.
Um, Jeff, I was wondering if you would do us the honor of giving a toast at our wedding?
Good idea!
Jeff has a lot of thoughts about marriage.
I would be honored.
Shirley, do you need any help with your wedding?
This probably sounds silly, but every time I see a wedding idea I like, I put it in a little scrapbook.
Oh, that's nice.
Ooh.
We can help too.
We just saw the inspector spacetime wedding episode, so we know what pitfalls to avoid.
Be sure to get a DNA reading of your prospective mate.
Inspector spacetime ended up marrying himself as a baby.
I think I got this.
Everyone just come and Relax and behave normally.
That's the noise people make when they're offended in all the movies that Annie rents.
We'll try not to embarrass you at your community college library wedding.
- Thank you.
- Oh, Shirley, I managed to set up a meeting with the Dean, so we can pitch him our sandwich shop idea.
I've already registered a website It's, uh, h-t-t-p, colon, forward slash, forward slash, w-w-w, period, members, period, webplicity custom sites All one word period, - c-o - Oh, I don't know, Pierce.
I'm way too busy for that now with the wedding and everything.
Bye-bye, everybody.
- I have to practice my walk.
- Ooh.
Great.
Another business venture down the toilet.
No problem, I've still got plan "C".
Ladies and gentlemen, the trouser bench.
For the man on the go who makes frequent stops.
Will somebody please call all the ambulances?
I can't believe Shirley.
We should show up at this wedding and be the most normal people in the world.
Yeah, I could go as normal man and you could be my trusty sidekick ordinario.
- No.
- That's already weird.
We'd be playing into her hand.
We should just show up wearing boring gray suits with gray ties and gray shirts.
We could dye our hair gray.
And then we could lay down on the sidewalk and be invisible.
You know, maybe Shirley's got a point.
I have an idea.
What if we purged all the weirdness from our systems?
- You mean - A full 24-hour weird-down in the dreamatorium.
Just you, me, and our imaginations no restraints.
By the wedding, our temptation to act weird will be gone.
I'm feeling more normal already.
- Crab walk home?
- Yeah.
Shirley, my ninth-grade english teacher used to say, "there will always be a reason not to follow your dreams".
At the time, he meant I was under the age of consent.
But his words still apply.
Are you sure your wedding is the reason you're bailing - on this business with Pierce?
- Uh, in the words of my ninth-grade english teacher, "you are dippin' and dappin' and don't know what's happenin'".
Fine, we both went to public school.
It's just that I don't want to see you slide - into your old comfort zone.
- You don't know that.
I am gonna start a business Soon!
I can't help it if I have floral arrangements to pick and a DJ to hire Shirley, if that really is your excuse, I will plan your wedding for you!
Ooh-hoo!
Thank you.
Oh, my good God.
Thank you for that.
I was serious.
Britta, you're not planning my wedding.
- What if Annie helps?
- Oh, hey, guys.
Did someone say "Annie", "help," "wedding," and something about maybe hydrangeas?
Shirley, you can lie to yourself, but you can't lie to me.
Do not use your second wedding as an excuse to limit yourself.
Pierce, come here.
Shirley, do you take this man to be your business partner?
- Mmm, I guess.
- Sure.
I had to shelve the trouser bench anyway.
There are still some parts of the prototype that need to be extracted.
Maybe you're misunderstanding?
I mean, from my butt.
Excuse me.
Meet Shirley, she's modern, she's urban, she's fun, and she's hungry.
You probably notice she's black, but not a stereotype - Suburban black.
- Is she suburban or urban?
She's half-urban.
Let's say Writer's secret, bad pitch Her father's a record producer, her mother's a Shirelle.
We're supposed to be preparing a business pitch.
What about revenue projections?
What are the margins gonna be?
Shirley, Shirley, Shirley, Shirley, Shirley, Shirley, Shirley.
Sweet, innocent Shirley.
- What was the question?
- Look, this was Britta's stupid idea.
I'd rather be with my man, planning my wedding, and you'd clearly rather be with Halle Berry in 1999.
Pleasure not doing business with you.
Shirley, Hawthorne wipes fired me.
They were just waiting for my dad to be out of the picture.
I'm not an entrepreneur.
I'm just a kid with a bunch of money, I Please, please, help me be somebody.
Let me invest in you.
First thing we need to figure out is our overhead.
Do you have a pen?
Yeah.
Oops.
These pockets.
Do you know someone that can buy a pen?
Yes!
Well, have you thought about the color story for your wedding?
He means the theme of the wedding.
- Right, Dale?
- Mm-hmm.
Same theme as every wedding Conformity, blind participation, and patriarchal - What about pink?
- We don't call it pink.
We don't call anything by its name.
That's, like, day-one floral school stuff.
This is citrine.
This is opalescent.
This is sea glass, cameo, and cerulean.
Come on, how difficult is this?
You do one of these, one of these, one of these, this one, this one and, like, stick a ribbon on it.
Happy?
Britta, that's a really beautiful arrangement.
Color me lavender.
"Lavender" means "impressed".
Yeah, well, great Flowers look good in a pot.
There are people dying in Uganda.
Got it.
What!
Ugh!
- Ahh, ahh, ahh.
- Don't eat my skin!
I am shaving everything!
- Well, that should do it.
- Yeah.
My God, isn't tonight Shirley's wedding rehearsal?
Look at how we're dressed.
Yes, this simply won't do.
Let's change into something appropriate for the occasion and be on our way.
I agree.
Troy and Abed being normal.
Annie!
I need your help.
Um, you're, like, sentimental and stuff.
Oh!
I'm really having trouble coming up with a toast.
I find that hard to believe, Jeff.
You once convinced Troy that turtlenecks were made of turtles' necks.
It's true, my superpower is that I can assume any position that suits my purpose.
In that example Keeping turtlenecks as an option for myself, down the road.
But I do have a kryptonite.
It's so obvious to me that marriage is dumb, I can't even pretend to get behind it.
You know what I think would make the perfect toast?
You, as Shirley's friend and a good guy, just saying what's really in your heart.
There's something real in there.
Maybe that's what scares you.
I could use a drink.
Shirley's sandwiches can offer students more food for less money, and provide the campus with a higher percentage of the profits.
Pierce, put up the next slide.
That's me!
Where'd I get all that money I'm holding?
I'm gonna tell you the three reasons that Shirley's sandwiches and your cafeteria are going to be successful.
Well, then I'm writing this down, hmm?
Wait.
Here's a pen.
Thank you.
ooh ooh ooh ooh - ooh ooh ooh ooh - Holy crap!
Britta, you're really good at this.
- I know.
- What's wrong with you?
This may shock you, Annie, but I come from a long line - of wives and mothers.
- Many do.
But I ran away from it my whole life.
I refused to give Santa a christmas list, because I didn't want to depend on any man for anything.
And now, look at me!
I'm Betty Crocker.
I'm Martha Stewart.
I'm one of the Steppenwolf wives.
Ohh, God.
I'm gonna make some man very happy someday.
Ooh.
Easy.
Slow down.
What's with you guys?
We de-whimsified ourselves.
Yep.
We're normal now.
Oh.
Good?
Hey, anybody seen Shirley?
What?
Shirley's late to the rehearsal for her wedding?
Oh, my.
Hey, man.
You don't have to be sarcastic.
I'm not being sarcastic.
We're heavily invested in your situation.
Nothing's more important to us than your second wedding's rehearsal going smoothly.
Walk away, man.
Hey!
Did you think of a toast?
Well, yeah.
Uh, I had a drink, and I looked in my heart, and here's what I got so far "Webster's dictionary defines" Gah!
Stop!
"Webster's dictionary defines"?
That's the Jim Belushi of speech openings It accomplishes nothing, but everyone keeps using it - and nobody understands why.
- Yeah, well, it's all I got.
That took me eight hours and six macallan neatses.
Look, I'm sorry, I just don't believe in marriage.
I do.
It's inevitable.
And then I'd put a counter across here and the ovens there.
Okay, okay.
And how fiscal will the quarterly earnings be?
Well, initially, the fiscal Wait, that question makes no sense.
Ah!
I know.
I just want to sound as good at business as you are.
I probably shouldn't say this, but I cannot believe you learned all this at Greendale.
- You're very professional.
- I am, aren't I?
I brought sodas, so we can toast to our futures.
Look at me now, dad.
Dad?
Oh, my God, I'm supposed to be looking like a bride for my wedding rehearsal to the dad of my children.
That was And odd dot to connect.
give me another.
Mmm.
What's with you?
This is who I am.
Andre, sorry I'm late.
I have wonderful news.
- Where were you?
- Uh, getting wonderful news.
The Dean loved our pitch and Your pitch?
Woman, I've been waiting for you for two hours.
Oh, no.
Has it been that long?
I'm so sorry.
Don't you dare use your sexy voice on me.
Ohh.
It's just a rehearsal.
Lord knows we've done it before.
That's not the point.
Shirley, I thought this wedding was supposed to be the start of us getting back to normal.
- Back to normal?
- Yes.
I need to not be Mr. Mom anymore.
Okay, I got to get back to my stereo business.
You know my store's been struggling.
I'm sorry, Andre, but "normal" went out the door the day you did.
Well, if we can't get back to the way things were, why the hell are we getting remarried?
Oy These shrimp are to die for.
Yah, yah, yah!
Yah, yah, yah!
Walk the plank.
I think you've mistaken us for pirates.
We are community college students.
Abed, I just had an odd thought.
What if once you go from being weird to normal, you can never go back to being weird again?
That is an odd thought.
Well, let's hope it's the last.
Cheers to that, my everyday friend.
Hello, everyone.
Shirley asked me to say something nice at her wedding.
- This is the rehearsal.
- Shut up, Leonard!
Those teenage girls you play ping-pong with are doing it ironically.
Well!
I searched my heart For something nice to say at a wedding.
And I found nothing, so I had a drink.
And then I looked real hard.
And you know what I found?
My daddy said he would stay with my mommy forever, and he left!
Marriage is a lie!
Nobody commits to this!
Nobody stays with anybody forever, so why do we keep lying?
I'm gonna stay with somebody forever.
It's in my stupid DNA.
I was born to be a wife and that's all I'm ever gonna be!
You expect anyone here to believe that?
I don't care if anybody believes it, jackass!
- It's a fact!
- Prove it, ding dong!
There are a lot of layers to this.
It's almost too conceptual to follow, but I love it.
So that's what this was all about, Andre?
Just about wanting me back in the kitchen?
I thought you loved being a wife and a mother.
Of course, but can't you see that's not all I'm about anymore.
Hi, sorry, don't want to interrupt.
But you are cordially invited to prevent a disaster.
I promise to put your dreams before mine.
I promise to bottle up my repulsion at the sight of your hair in the drain.
I promise to earn no more than at the same job.
- What about babies?
- What about 'em?
- How many?
- Pick a number, dick!
Like, it's up to me!
What in God's name are you two doing?
Getting married.
What does it look like we're doing?
You two are damn fools.
Oh, sorry.
- I'll allow it.
- I am a fool.
I was a fool to think I wasn't destined for a life of this.
I mean, look around.
Can you even imagine what kind of wedding I could throw if I actually gave a crap?
- No offense.
- Knock it off.
Being good at weddings doesn't make you good at marriage.
Exactly.
People can make all sorts of promises, but they never stick it out.
It's not something you just stick out, man, all right?
It's a risk that you take together.
And you don't just promise it once.
You got to promise it every day.
Yes, but the person you're making promises to is going to change.
You have to accept that.
I do.
But do you promise to be patient when that person's stereo business takes a little while - to get off the ground.
- I do, but Do you accept that ten years is more than a little while and that iPods aren't going away, and maybe it's time to let somebody else take the lead?
I do.
You do?
Yes, baby, I swear I do.
Then I promise I will do whatever it takes to make this work forever.
Oh!
Well, in that case, let's rehearse this bad boy.
- Mm-hmm.
- Actually, you pretty much just married each other.
If you let me pronounce you man and wife, you can kiss the bride and you can save like, um, - What do you say, baby?
- Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Done and done.
Husband and wife.
Now how about it?
Let's party!
Lame.
Abed.
Abed!
Abed!
We're weird.
We need to be weird.
You want to see something weird?
Check out this dance.
Uh, what did you call this?
The "Lindbergh lean"?
What'll they think of next?
Inspector spacetime Ohh, thank the cosmic engineer I found you.
Troy, this is hardly the time.
Or is it hardly the space?
Okay, I see what you did there.
But now I have to get back to my Lindbergh lean with, uh I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
Inspector What sort of creature would do a dance called the Lindbergh lean?
- Blorgons?
- Blorgons.
My name's Danielle.
Constable Reggie, it appears the Blorgons have developed - the ability to take human form.
- Weirdos.
Your photonic bowler hat.
Ahh.
Blorgon patrol.
Shirley, I have some good news and bad news.
The good news is the board loved your sandwich shop idea.
The bad news is that they made a few calls and sold the space to subway, the sandwich place.
What?
Pierce and I put a lot of work into that idea.
- How could you do this, Dean?
- I'm sorry!
The board went over my head on this one.
And I don't remember being invited to your wedding, so I guess we're even on the hurting-each-other front.
I'm a blast at weddings.
There go all my dreams.
This is just a setback.
You don't have to give up just because of subway.
Guess I better go break the news to Pierce.
He's not gonna like this.
Remember that temper tantrum he threw when Adam Sandler "stole" his idea for Jack and Jill?
You're underestimating him.
I think Pierce is a lot more mature than we all give him credit for.
Look at me now, dad!
How's it taste?
How many sandwich places did you have?
None!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
- Hi, Pierce.
Oh - Hi!
Hi, Percival!
- Hi.
- Hey.
Happy New Year, you guys.
Do anything fun over break?
Oh, baby Ben got to be baby Jesus in our church's nativity play.
Andre was Joseph, and Jordan was one of the wise men, and I was in charge of casting.
I digitized my entire movie collection.
Goodbye, VHS.
Hello, SelectaVision CED Videodisc.
I'm very psyched for the new semester.
Or should I say Intro to Human Psyched.
The worst.
For our midterm, we actually get to diagnose a fellow student with something.
Don't you do way too much of that already?
Accusational opposition disorder.
Hello.
Whoa.
It appears you've all noticed that my swagger has a new swagger.
I'll explain.
Over break, I took the plunge and started seeing a new shrink.
What?
Hello!
Hello.
Anyway, I talked about my dad, punched a few pillows.
And she put me on this amazing anti-anxiety pill.
It's really enhanced my self-confidence.
I explained that really well.
Jeff, you can't be on anti-anxiety meds.
What little self-doubt you have is the only thing keeping your ego penned in.
You are a textbook narcissist.
I'm an exceptional narcissist, Britta.
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't kill my wife!
I don't care.
Stop that fugitive!
I was wondering how long it would take for things to get back to normal.
Over break, Abed realized he could hire celebrity impersonators from a service for his own personal use.
He's been doing it a lot.
He's not hurting anybody.
He just likes reenacting scenes from movies.
It's unquestionably awesome.
I question it.
He spent New Year's locked in our bathroom with a bad Tom Hanks from cast away.
Abed was the volleyball?
- Well, that makes sense.
- You guys, focus!
Where's he getting the money for all this?
Intervention.
Intervention.
Intervention.
No!
You guys need to stop intervening.
You seriously have a problem.
- I said I didn't kill my wife!
- I still don't care.
Freeze!
Chang, they're just acting!
- Oh.
Sorry.
- What was that?
- Somebody call the cops!
- I've got a friend at the zoo.
Give me some rope, time in a tree give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away What is this I hear about a tranquilizer gun?
If you had hit a small student, they could have died!
I wouldn't do that.
I have a heavy flashlight for them.
Oh, Ben!
Look, I have to resort to extreme measures.
I'm a one-man army.
You won't let me have any guards.
We're broke, Ben!
We now get 80% of our electricity from the apartment building across the street.
Okay I don't know who told you pouting was an option for you, but all you're making me feel right now is hatred of Renee Zellweger.
Look, maybe you can bring on some students as security interns.
I'll let you offer them a credit in safety or math or something.
Thank you, sir.
You won't regret this unless I rise up against you.
I don't know why I said that.
Bye.
Huh!
Tah!
Zhou!
Zeet!
Dah!
Toi!
Jeff.
Jeff!
I looked it up.
I was right.
Oh, that thing about Danny Thomas?
I looked it up too.
Weird.
No, those meds you're taking.
Without anxiety to keep your vanity in check, you are vulnerable to a syndrome called hyper-narcissosis.
Okay, look.
This apple is your ego.
Imagine it expanding to the point of critical mass, taking over your whole personality, making you an uncontrollable monster.
Britta, how did an apple make that clear?
Imagine it expanding?
- Use a balloon.
- I was on my way to lunch.
Why are you trying to take this away from me?
I like having no anxiety.
I'm in harmony with the world.
Looking good, Winger.
Thank you, Leonard, for that compliment, and for your service to this country.
I'm so confident now, I can pull things off I never dreamed possible.
Look.
Aviators.
Final boarding call, beefcake airways.
I'm warning you as your friend to get off of those meds.
And until they're out of your system, stay away from flattering situations weddings, soft lighting, formal wear, gay bars.
And take those off!
Because they make me look good?
That's not relevant.
Ah, welcome back, Jeffrey.
How was your Uhh uhh unh!
Oh, my God!
Even his shadow!
Look at his shadow!
Security internship available.
Come on, see the world.
Well, you won't see the world, but come on!
- Hey, Nadir.
- Oh, hey, Vinnie.
Vinnie's the owner of the doppelgang, the celebrity impersonator service I use.
You look familiar.
That's how we all get started in this racket.
But at a certain point, if you're smart, you move up to management before the gold mine of resembling French Stewart runs dry.
- Ah - French Stewart And speaking of gold mines, you owe me three grand, pal.
Cool.
Put it on my account.
What do I look like, a sucker?
French Stewart.
But I don't have three grand.
Well, you know what, you better get it.
Because I'm gonna tell you something right now Holy crap, you'd make an amazing Seacrest.
Very kind.
Thank you.
You're actually a lot taller than Seacrest.
You've actually got a sharper jaw too.
You're actually more handsome than the guy that's famous for being handsome.
Jeff?
You'll be okay.
Just stay humble.
You know what, maybe there's another option for you.
I've got a big event saturday.
Needs a lot of bodies, huh?
And I see some high-value faces here.
Got an Oprah.
- Oh!
- And sitting next to her is a Judy Garland or an Anne Hathaway.
Add a few extra teeth.
Wow, this is rare.
Both versions of Michael Jackson.
And you - Fat Brando.
- Burt Reynolds.
- What?
- What?
- Fat Brando.
- Burt Reynolds.
- Whatever.
- Whatever.
Look, if you guys work this gig for me for six hours, we'll call it even.
Sounds fun.
Abed, Vinnie, can we have a minute to talk about this?
Sure.
Come on, Vinnie.
The guy who makes the fish sticks looks just like Quincy Jones.
- Get out.
- Seriously.
Guys, I'm sorry, but this is where we have to put our foot down.
Well, she has a point.
Next time it'll be $10,000, and then $20,000, and then he'll hit rock bottom and have no one to turn to but Jesus.
I say we let this play out.
I'd love to help, but playing Ryan Seacrest at a big party may not be a safe situation for me.
We could actually hurt Abed if every time he faces reality, we dress up and play make-believe to bail him out.
Shame on you people.
It's not our job to help Abed grow up.
Abed doesn't need reality.
Abed is a magical, elf-like man who makes us all more magical by being near us.
Pierce, who came over in the middle of the night that time you forgot how to fart?
- Abed.
- Shirley Who got you a DVD of Precious, based on the novel Push, by Sapphire, and a copy of the novel Push autographed by Sapphire?
Abed.
All we had was dumb reality before we met that man.
And he's made all of our lives better than reality.
Now it becomes a little inconvenient, and it's time to get real?
For shame!
He's right.
Sorry, Troy.
Hey, guys.
Abed, we would be happy to help you out.
It'll be a good time.
- Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
- Cool.
- Oprah.
- Oh, thank you.
- See ya, Vin.
- Fat Brando.
- Burt Reynolds.
- Yeah.
Thanks for being flexible.
This'll be fun.
Fun.
Yeah, sure.
But here's the deal.
Um, if you guys mess this up, then his debt is overdue.
And I don't send another bill.
No, I send two guys that look a lot like Ving Rhames and Michael Chiklis.
And they do a very convincing impression of breaking your friend's legs.
Their secret is They actually break them.
All right, impersonators, our guest of honor is one Howie Schwartz, who, according to the Talmud, just became a man.
But I have to say, I wouldn't want him next to me in a foxhole.
- Ha!
- Ground rules Do stay in your assigned quadrants quoting lines from movies you are positive that your impersonatee was in.
Do not leave your quadrant, burp, fart, cough, hiccup, or cuss.
The obvious exception being James, our resident Walter Matthau.
How you doing, Jimmy?
Aw, you give 'em hell.
All right, let's go.
- All my life I has to fight.
- Ready to tangle.
Handsome Seacrest, I need you in this tux.
Jeff, do not wear that.
Aw, zip it, white Jacko.
Don't worry, that thing in the cafeteria freaked me out, so I talked to my shrink, and she doubled my dosage.
What?
Jeff, that's insane!
I thought so too, but after I took that extra pill, it seemed like a great idea.
- Jeff, put it on.
Go.
- No, Jeff!
Britta, stop arguing.
If you have anything else to say, say it in a high-pitched voice while walking backwards.
Jeff is in grave danger.
Hee-hee!
Uh, may I help you?
I'm one of the impersonators.
- Which one?
- Do I have to say it?
Burt Reynolds.
Uh, yeah, I don't believe anybody hired you to impersonate Burt Reynolds.
- Why not?
- Do I have to say it?
- May I help you?
- I'm Brando.
Hmm Could be under "fat".
Ah.
Oh.
Totally.
Go on in.
Bam.
Abed, get back to your station.
I can't right now, I'm talking to Geena Davis.
Abed, we have to do this right or Vinnie won't clear your debt.
Troy, who cares about money?
Look around.
This is why we're alive.
Ooh, fake Lorenzo Lamas.
Let's go.
I was so sad to hear of your passing.
Me too.
Sergeant Chang, what are you doing here?
Hey, Annie.
Just one of the perks when your brother's a rabbi.
He throws me some private security gigs at the events he officiates.
They can get really intense sometimes.
Can you believe some jerk brought a scalpel to a bris?
Now smile.
Why is he out of his quadrant?
I'm Lorenzo Lamas.
- He's reenacting a movie.
- Please.
What movie were Jamie Lee Curtis and Lorenzo Lamas in together?
See, now I'm just embarrassed for you because you've never seen Lorenzo's Oil.
Lorenzo is an oil tycoon that gets his address book switched with Jamie Lee Curtis', and they give each other piggyback rides.
I can't believe did you go to college?
Yes.
No.
Whatever.
Keep working.
Oh, my God.
You are gorgeous!
Would you look at this one.
He's like a Robert Redford.
No, no, more like a taller, hotter Ryan Seacrest.
It's amazing, you're actually more handsome than the guy who's famous for being handsome.
Skull Cracker 2000.
Top of the line.
- Who wants to hold it?
- Me!
- That's so cool.
- Awesome.
Dude, this is so sick.
Check this out.
Any of you fine young men interested in a college credit?
- Sure!
- Right!
Look, man, if you have a request, not a real DJ, okay.
These are just props.
You look like a friend of mine.
You're friends with Moby?
- Jeff!
- Oh!
I haven't been dipped like that since my last divorce.
Britta, you were right.
I can feel my ego taking over.
Do something!
Okay, listen to me.
You are not that big of a deal.
Do you understand?
You have bad posture.
When you do to many push-ups, it looks like you have boobs.
The tile in your bathroom is tacky.
You were emotionally closed off in bed to the point where one time, I didn't come up because I couldn't find close enough parking.
You have an unusually high butt crack.
Thank you.
It couldn't have been easy for you to lie like that.
We are getting you out of here.
Get back to your quadrant.
Now!
Britta!
Honey, you were the highlight of the evening.
If it were up to me, you'd win every single award.
There's awards?
Ladies and non-gentlemen, welcome to Howie Schwartz's Star Mitzvah Awards.
Here to present the first award are fake Morgan Freeman and fake Bono.
You know, fake Bono, algebra can be tough.
It sure can, fake Morgan Freeman.
And that's why it's so important to reward those to whom it comes so easily.
The winner for best math student is Howie Schwartz.
Wow, these things are heavy.
The award for cleanest room goes to Howie Schwartz.
Coolest skateboard trick, Howie Schwartz!
Howie Schwartz!
If you ask me, I think you're gonna win the award for most handsome young man.
Nah.
Oh, give me a break.
It's his Bar Mitzvah.
Jeff, I think that we should go.
There's an award for most handsome young man!
Hello, everyone.
It is my honor and privilege as fake Oprah Winfrey to present the night's final award most handsome young man.
Aww And the winner is Howie Schwartz!
Nooo!
Aah!
Look at me!
Look at meee!
No, Jeffrey!
Jeffrey oh!
Oh!
Oh, God, no!
- What the hell?
- You wanted it!
You all want it!
Aahhh-ha-ha-ha!
Aaahh!
- Rargh!
- Aah!
- Grr!
- Ow!
Ah!
Unh!
Grr!
Ha!
I love you, dad!
I knew you'd invite the Hulk!
You're lucky.
And your friend's debt is paid.
Hey, Jimmy, wait up.
Boogie Nights.
You're fat Burt Reynolds, right?
I'll take it.
Abed, your leg!
What'd they do?
Tell me who they looked like!
Doc, doc!
Who's there?
It's your femur bone.
He needs some money.
He's broke.
Ha ha ha.
Hey.
Laughter's the best medicine.
What are what are you doing?
I'm challenging your entire medical establishment, sir.
Not you.
So we just spent our whole night paying off your debt, and you're blowing money on a Patch Adams?
It's two for one.
We're doing Popeye next.
Ah-ga-ga-ga-ga.
Get him some spinach.
I'm Olive Oyl.
Get out!
Are you mad at me?
- No.
- Cool.
I was gonna go in the Dreamatorium and play Inspector Spacetime.
Have fun.
- Abed.
- Yeah?
Come here.
I am mad at you.
You said you weren't.
We never lie.
- I know.
- We made a deal.
October 15, 2009.
Friends don't lie to each other.
I know!
I lied.
Because you don't like people who tell you what to do, and I don't want to be one of those people.
- Then don't be.
- I have to be.
You have to stop renting celebrity impersonators.
Vinnie was gonna break both of your legs.
I had to work really hard to help you.
But that's what you wanted to do.
Yes.
But I can't do what I want to do?
I guess not.
Not all the time.
Sometimes you're just gonna have to trust - that I know better about stuff.
- I don't know if I can do that.
Then I guess you're gonna have to trust that you're gonna have to trust me.
Well, I don't want to stop being your friend, so I guess I'll let you tell me what to do sometimes.
Still best friends?
Yeah.
Still best friends.
Always.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
You still gonna go to the Dreamatorium?
Oh, yeah, but I think I'm gonna play by myself right now, if that's okay.
Cool.
Okay.
Cool.
Seacrest Hulk, you're the greatest!
Whoo!
You rock, Seacrest Hulk!
I love you, Seacrest Hulk!
You know, Seacrest Hulk, you're a meshugeneh.
You okay?
No.
I ruined a Bar Mitzvah.
I'm a bad person.
What you're feeling is called shame.
It means you're getting better.
You're gonna be safe again once those pills wear off.
Um, I was thinking You know that person that you study for your psych class?
Maybe that should be me.
Uh-uh.
No way.
You are way out of my league, diagnostically speaking.
I'm gonna go with someone a little less complicated.
Like Abed.
Hi, Abed.
- Hi.
- Where's Troy?
In the other room.
That's okay.
There are many advantages of traveling by yourself.
You can drive faster, change direction.
And the only pee breaks are yours.
- Are you real?
- Are you?
This is really crazy.
And inaccessible, and maybe too dark.
Maybe to them, but not to us.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Hot.
Hot, hot, hot.
Gentlemen Who's ready to chang the world?
Chang!
Chang!
Chang!
Chang!
Chang!
Chang!
Chang!
Chang!
All hail Chang!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
This is a historic day for Greendale.
This state-of-the-art Subway sandwichery in our cafetorium represents Greendale's first steps forward into the realm of the legitimate!
Students: Ooh.
Oh, oh.
No problem.
You know what?
I'm just going to get it started with my teeth.
The legitimate!
Oh.
The legitimate!
That should be my sandwich shop.
It was my idea to put one there.
- We're here for you, Shirley.
- Yeah.
Troy, Annie, and I know what it's like to be displaced.
They're tenting our building for termites, so we're homeless.
I'm staying in the sleep study lab.
All I have to do is wake up every three hours and go  And I get two credits.
Yeah, and we're going to build a super awesome pillow fort - here at the school.
- Another pillow fort?
Kind of repeating yourselves, aren't you?
That was a blanket fort.
This will be a pillow fort.
Way more difficult, way better.
All difficult things are better, like carrying a disease - or holding in a fart right now.
- Aha!
I just found out how Shirley and I are going to take down Subway.
- Oh, how?
- Dean?
I assume you're familiar with the Greendale bylaws.
- I am not.
- Shirley, you do the honors.
My brain starts getting weird this time of night.
It's 10:00 a.m. - You're welcome.
- Uh-oh.
"Any business operating for profit on Greendale's campus must be at least 51% owned by a registered Greendale student"!
That's too bad, Dean.
I don't recall seeing Subway in my premenopausal, postfeminist experiential marketing class.
Actually, I'm on the wait list - for the premen/postfem/ex mark.
- Who are you?
Gang, meet Greendale's newest student, Subway.
Your name is Subway?
Yep, using a groundbreaking but surprisingly legal process known as "corpohumanization", real people such as myself are now allowed to represent the collective humanity of business owners.
I have contractually waived my birth identity and am now a man and student named Subway.
I don't believe this.
Come on, Subway, there is no way you're 5'10".
So you can vote?
Actually, no, because technically I'm only a week old.
Aww.
But please don't think of me as any less human than yourselves.
I'm here to hang out, take weird classes, and party as hearty as my morality clause allows.
Eat fresh?
Eat fresh?
- Eat fresh.
- That's my man.
Wow, did you know Greendale students are technically in the army reserves?
Let's say a little prayer for peace.
Give me some rope, time in a tree give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away Annie, you've got to get me into this sleep lab.
I can't think of a better use of my time here than being unconscious.
It's not a blowoff class, Jeff.
We're only allowed to bring one stuffed animal.
I'm bringing Ruthie  But using her pouch to sneaking Nathan.
Well, have fun.
Wait, since when do we have lockers?
Uh, since registration day, 2009.
Jeff, did you skip the Preorientation Freshman Welcome Seminar and Diversity Fire Circle?
This explains so much about you.
Are you saying I've had a locker here for 2 1/2 years?
Whoa, whoa.
Wow.
"Halloween dance".
"Post-Halloween dance".
"Dance contest".
"Contest dance".
Oh, come on.
What's this?
"Save Garrett"?
What's wrong with Garrett?
Nothing now.
We saved him.
Aah!
Wait, that's "saved" Garrett?
Ooh, what's this?
Love letter?
Oh, it's probably one of many.
Oh, no.
This is a hate letter.
What?
Let me see that.
"Dear Jeff, this might come as a shock "to someone who thinks he's God's gift to the world, "but you're actually an inconsiderate jerk.
Kim".
- "Inconsiderate"?
- Who's Kim?
I don't know, and clearly she doesn't know me.
-  - Gesundheit.
I didn't sneeze.
Look at these idiots.
Cattle, sheep Other animals that travel in herds.
I want to say snakes.
Am I the only person enraged by the fact that corporations are taking human form?
I totally predicted this in my High School newspaper column "Britta unfiltered".
- Unfiltered.
I get it.
- Get what?
Actually, maybe Subway taking human form could be its undoing.
Uh, Britta You're a, uh, progressive woman of a more liberated looseness.
You could get close to Subway and find out some dirt on him.
Corporate espionage.
I like it.
Microphones hidden in lipstick.
Lipstick hidden in microphones.
And the deadliest weapon of them all - The penis flytrap.
- Okay!
This conversation is over.
I am not a whore, and not that I've done the math, but if I were, I'd be the super classy kind that gets flown to Dubai to stay in an underwater hotel.
- Abed, Troy.
- Ah, don't worry, Dean.
We have all the proper permits right here.
Oh, silly me!
This is a coupon for 20% off at bed bath & beyond.
No need to bribe me, Troy.
Actually There's plenty more where that came from.
Look, I was just googling record lengths of stuff, and apparently there's a guinness world record for the biggest pillow or blanket fort.
So you boys you should go for it.
Put this school on the map.
We'd have a better chance of setting the record if we made this a blanket fort, you know, take less time.
We wanted to make a pillow fort.
I don't want to sacrifice quality for square footage.
We don't need a world record to tell us we did something cool.
But if we won, we might meet that dude with the curly fingernails.
Shridhar Chillal?
Not interested.
I saw him on a talk show.
He came off as pretentious.
- I'm going to go get a drink.
- Okay.
- Troy Barnes.
- Vice Dean Laybourne.
You have a beard And a ponytail.
Going through some stuff right now, Troy.
Don't worry about it.
Any chance you've given a second thought to joining my air conditioning repair school?
Sorry.
Kind of busy at the moment doing some awesome work with Abed.
Ah, yeah, Abed.
You guys watch that television show together, don't you?
Inspector Spacetime.
Funny, Troy.
You and Abed have always reminded me of the inspector and his trusty constable Reggie.
Cool!
The inspector, of course, is smart, decisive, and Reggie is Well, he's Reggie.
Reggie is trained in zero-gravity martial arts and has a whistle.
Yeah.
But he never really gets to blow the whistle unless the inspector says it's okay.
Less of a friendship, more of a self-centered nerd and his naive, obedient lapdog.
Well, I got a thing.
You take care.
Well, according to the office, this is the locker of the only Kim I've had any class with since 2009.
Wonder what you did to make her so mad.
Maybe the two of you made out, and then you forgot about her.
Annie, that's what you think of me?
I don't make out with forgettable women.
Can I help you?
We're looking for Kim McFadden.
- This is her locker, right?
- Are you serious?
She slipped a note into my locker a couple years ago.
I guess I pissed her off somehow.
- I'm hoping to apologize.
- That might not be easy.
Kim's no longer with us.
- She died two weeks ago.
- What?
Sorry to drop that on you and run, but there's a rally for Garrett.
But we saved him.
Did we?
What do you recommend?
What's it to you, meat pusher?
Sounds like you might be a vegetarian.
You should try Subway's Veggie Delite.
You should try reading Orwell's 1984.
I have.
It's a great book.
It really awakened me in High School.
I think kids should be forced to read it.
Me too.
Anyway, you're living it.
You're a human puppet with big sandwich's hand up your ass.
Is this what you dreamt of being?
Unfortunately I'm not allowed to discuss my former life or engage in any nonplatonic relations, practice religion in public, or eat any nonfresh, unhealthy food like that found anywhere outside Subway.
Why are you getting all that?
I wanted to stand next to you for a moment.
It was worth it.
Like a good book by Orwell or a Veggie Delite.
Is that you, Subway?
My eyesight ain't what it used to be.
Eat these tater tots, Harry.
For what it's worth, I think you might see more than all of us.
Did you see him smiling at you?
Top-notch whoresmanship, Britta.
- Pierce.
- Sorry.
Whoreswomanship.
Forgot it was the '90s.
Uh-oh.
Anyway Thank you, Britta.
I knew we could count on you to help us take him down!
Yep, that's me, the girl who's going to destroy the big sandwich company with the dreamy eyes.
Ooh!
We did it, Pierce.
Powerful passage, isn't it?
"She had become a physical necessity".
You circled this paragraph.
I can't say that I did.
I just think it's a striking expression of love's ability to persevere within the cracks and cogs of inhuman systems.
Who were you, Subway, before you were Subway?
I can't say.
I have to live within the rules.
This identity is my life.
If I do this for three more years, I can live a real dream.
Well, at least tell me what that is.
I want to run a nonprofit shelter for handicapped animals.
Dogs with wheels for hind legs.
- Deaf hamsters.
-  One-eyed cats?
Well, they weren't on the top of my list, but sure.
I should go.
This is getting out of bounds for me.
Eat fresh.
You should put the small ones in the middle, or the wall won't hold the ceiling.
Why do I always have to be your Reggie?
What?
I wanted to make a blanket fort, and you never even gave it a second thought.
I'm not even your sidekick.
I'm your underkick.
I never said you couldn't do anything.
If you want to make a blanket fort, that's fine with me.
Thank you.
Just don't make it part of my pillow fort.
Fine.
I'll start it somewhere else.
Have fun stacking pillows like a baby.
Jeff, are you okay?
I'm lying on campus furniture, so no.
Is it about this Kim girl?
She is someone who died thinking I was a dick.
I can never apologize.
I can never change her mind.
That makes me a dick forever.
You think that's what an apology is?
A spell you cast on another person to make them forgive you?
Apologies are opportunities to admit your own mistakes.
Apologize to her locker.
But how can I apologize if I don't know what I did wrong?
Well, didn't she call you inconsiderate?
Sounds to me like you know exactly what you did wrong.
- Leonard, what are you doing?
- Abed's fort needs pillows.
But I was going to lie there.
I was going to invest in IBM in 1952, but life is full of disappointments.
Eating fresh, are we?
Have you found any dirt on Subway yet?
No, nothing.
I should probably hang out with him more.
You know what I think?
I think you're falling for him.
I am not.
Who do you think I am?
I lived in New York.
You never lived anywhere.
You're a weapon designed for sex.
You only think you lived in New York 'cause I implanted your memories.
Oh, Pierce, stop it!
Look what we're becoming.
I'm sorry we pulled you into this dirty game.
I want you to stop.
Yeah, we're pulling you out Right after your last assignment.
This pen is a microphone.
It's also a miniflask.
Did you just drink ink?
Just plant this on Subway, and you'll never have to see him again.
Until then, keep him interested.
And for God's sakes, slap some life on those dead lips.
Hello, Abed.
How's the pillow fort going?
It's hard making something perfect, but it's worth it.
Yeah, I'll remember that when I'm being given a key to the secret guinness record holders' clubhouse, where I'll be hanging with those two fat guys on motorcycles and being fitted for a beard of bees.
Whoo!
Well, Troy, I just got off the phone with Guinness, and they are sending a representative to have a look-see at your blanket fort.
- Are we world-record ready?
- Garrett?
We are still more than 2,000 square feet shy of the record.
Abed's pillow fort is the only thing standing in our way.
Well, what are we going to do here, guys?
Is there a way we can connect them?
You can't connect the blanket fort to the pillow fort and still call it a pillow fort.
Even if you could, I'd rather see my work destroyed than compromise it.
Great, Abed will destroy his pillow fort, and Troy will expand his blanket fort into the space.
Everyone wins.
Except Abed, but you know, not everyone can win.
Is that what you want, Troy?
For me to destroy my pillow fort so you could set your record?
- It is.
- Magnitude.
Evacuate fort Abed, and prepare for self-destruct.
- Sir?
- Do it.
We're done here.
Pop, pop, Captain.
Oh!
Subway.
Britta, I was worried you wouldn't come.
- I can't stop thinking about you.
- Shh.
They wanted me to plant a bug on you.
I can't, and I won't.
Our values, our identities they mean nothing to me now.
Only the primal remains.
To me, you are simply a physical necessity.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Oh, Subway.
Subway.
- Oh, Subway.
- Mmm.
Oh, Subway.
Oh, no, no.
No, this is wrong, Pierce.
I just wanted to open a sandwich shop.
I did not sign up for this.
You don't want to get your hands dirty, fine.
I will.
Nice knowing you, Subway.
If that is your real name.
Ahh.
Kim.
It's me, Jeff.
The inconsiderate jerk.
Look, I don't remember hurting you, and I have to assume that's what hurt you.
God knows what crime you've committed to deserve me disregarding you entirely.
But whatever your crime, I think we both know the real crime is mine.
I'm a self-centered, shallow jackass.
And I just want to thank you for your note because I'm going to try and change.
I just wish you were here to forgive me.
I am.
And I do.
I'm Kim.
What?
You said Kim was dead.
Because you never remember who I am.
First year, we hung out, like, ten times.
And each time, you introduced yourself to me.
That's why I wrote that note.
And then today, it's like you still don't remember me.
And and you still assume from my name that I am a girl.
I had no choice but to make up that awesome story about a dead chick to hurt you like you hurt me.
I am so sorry Kim.
Right?
Do you know how long I've waited to hear you say that?
What the hell is this crap?
Annie, this is Kim.
I think because he had a girl's name, I never took him seriously.
It happens literally all the time, which is insane because 16% of all people named Kim are men.
-  I'm sorry, buddy.
- Don't apologize to this guy.
- You told me to apologize.
- To a dead girl's locker.
I thought I was representing the sisterhood.
Thought I was teaching you a lesson about all the girls you dominate and then ignore.
Not to waste your energy on some weird, cloying, hypersensitive stalker with a girl's name.
Hey!
You are really mean.
Put it in a letter, Jane Austen.
Prepare to initiate Protocol Omega.
Good-bye, pillow fort.
You were a beautiful dream.
More than a dream.
It's here.
Who are you?
Someone who understands dedication to craftsmanship in the face of mediocrity.
This world is run by the unremarkables.
Don't do what you always do, Abed.
Don't corrupt the host to pacify the parasites.
Ask yourself "What if I stopped worrying about their acceptance of me"?
What if it fell to the Reggies of the world to keep up with the inspectors or perish?
Now please turn your head while I crawl away.
I'm going through some stuff right now.
I'm very insecure.
What's going on?
I'll ask the questions here.
You had sex with Subway, and I recorded it.
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.
You know what, I'm going to let this one slide.
- What?
- What?
I know we have very strict rules against romantic entanglements with our corpohumanoids, but at this point in time, we can't stop them from having hearts.
These two are clearly in love.
If they want to express that love in a perfectly healthy way, then okay, hold on.
Th is this what I think it is?
That got unhealthy real quick.
That okay, that's yeah, that's weird.
That is well out of the mainstream.
You know, I was raised in the the Bay Area, but I I'm a father now.
Subway cannot stand for that, and frankly, Rick, - I-I'm surprised you did.
- My name is Subway.
Not anymore.
- The bread is stale.
- No!
No!
- Oh, my God.
- Subway, I love you!
- Britta!
- Shut up.
How could you?
Well, if that'll be all, I'll be on my way.
If someone could hand me my jacket.
It's right over there on the coatrack next to the door.
If somebody could just hand it to me, that would be great.
I guess I'm confused.
Why don't you just grab it on your way out the door You know what?
Now I'm not leaving.
Now I'm just going to sit for a while and focus on how unacceptable today was.
Jeff.
I wanted to apologize.
I never realized I had my own issues regarding gender roles, and it was certainly unfair of me to take them out on Kim.
Mm.
Who's Kim?
Corporate America has destroyed love.
- Again?
- Subway!
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else.
Britta, you silly.
It is me, Subway.
What?
I had a great time with you last night in the pillow fort, the one exception being the deviant sex act you initiated without my consent.
Eat fresh.
Aah!
- Whoa!
- Oh, jeez.
There is a situation developing in the study room.
I would elaborate, but I am out of breath because I walked here very briskly.
Calm down!
Calm!
Down!
- What's going on here?
- Abed won't tear down his fort.
I shouldn't have to compromise my craftsmanship - to placate mediocrity.
- Mediocrity?
Okay, b boys, boys.
The Guinness rep will be here in two days.
Can we just flip a coin to decide who has to back down?
- No.
- No.
Well, I'm Dean, so I'm making the call.
The pillow fort comes down.
- All right, you stay back.
- Watch it, Star-Burns.
My name is Alex!
This is war!
- Back, back.
- Back.
- Go.
- Back, back, back in the fort.
To be continued.
Sir, it appears that Troy Barnes' blanket fort may go to war with Abed Nadir's pillow fort.
Of course.
Soon Troy and Abed will be torn asunder, and an unencumbered Troy will turn to his destiny The air conditioning repair school.
You are a cold-blooded man, sir.
Yes.
How unfortunate for Troy and Abed.
See you in band practice.

"Between two groups of people "who want to make inconsistent kinds of worlds, I see no remedy but force".
Oliver Wendell Holmes.
There was a point where all I saw were feathers.
Then I started swinging.
And then I hit something and heard someone fall.
Could've been somebody from my side.
In 2012, Greendale Community College was the site of the largest and longest pillow fight in community college history.
It shaped and scarred the landscape of their campus and forever changed the lives of those involved.
A health care administration student, who turned the storage room into a sanctuary for soldiers with broken glasses and lightly grazed testicles.
A high school dropout and amateur photographer whose borrowed camera would capture some of the war's blurriest, most poorly framed moments.
A disgraced former lawyer whose words would inspire tens of students to take up pillows and fight, most likely to avoid an upcoming test.
A loving wife and mother who would prove to be as skilled at kicking asses as she was at wiping them.
The dried-up heir to a moist towelette empire, who would prove to be the dried-up heir to a moist towelette empire.
The sensitive high school quarterback who became commander in chief of his own army.
He would later say of the war, "it was awesome, but also, it wasn't".
And his socially dysfunctional best friend turned bitter rival, an uncompromising tactical mastermind feared by all yet unable to pay parking tickets or know left from right without mouthing the pledge of allegiance.
The rift in their friendship would carry their school into a conflict lasting days, costing hundreds of dollars and resulting in over 12 transfers.
There are people who say, "I don't get it.
So it was a pillow fight," to which I say "You weren't there".
Jeffrey, you have to come mediate Troy and Abed.
They look up to you.
What's with the film crew?
- Don't worry about that.
- Oh, I am worried about that.
If there's one thing I've learned at this place, it's that a film crew means disaster.
Okay, they are here to document Greendale's guinness record, which you are going to make sure we get by talking to Troy and Abed right now.
- This is your fault.
- No, it's your fault.
- This is your fault.
- Your fault.
- Your fault!
- Your fault!
Okay, I've got good news for both of you.
Neither of you has to apologize because what you're doing is equally ridiculous.
So here's the solution I'm pitching.
I'm giving you two imaginary Friendship Hats that automatically make you friends again.
Are we done?
Sorry, Jeff, but this matter's a little more serious than that.
No, it's not.
You're children acting like grown-ups.
I mean, it's fine.
But just don't pretend it's anything but that.
Troy Barnes and Abed Nadir.
Friends so close, they once graced the cover of Friends Weekly, a pretend magazine of their own design.
Earlier that day, they begin construction on a fort made of pillows.
Its name New Fluffytown.
Its goal to be a newer, fluffier town than Fluffytown, their blanket fort from the previous year.
New Fluffytown don't care who you were.
You were surrounded by softness.
It's just like crawling through a hug.
Well I guess all hugs have to come to an end.
When an opportunity arises for a world record, it creates a rift.
Troy wants to go for the record using blankets for rapid expansion.
Abed insists on pillows, declaring world records to be dumb.
Troy declares the Declaration Lame, stating that thinking records are dumb is stupid.
He secedes from New Fluffytown and begins constructing Blanketsburg on the other side of the campus.
Abed renames his fort Pillowtown for the sake of conceptual symmetry.
Both forts expand until both are in each other's way.
Study Room "F," 3:00 P.M., things quickly reach their boiling point.
- You stand back.
- Watch it, Star-Burns.
My name is Alex!
A softly lobbed, hypoallergenic sealy select in a floral print case collides with a load-bearing broomstick, collapsing a queen-sized section of blanket fort.
It was later named "The Study Room Kerfuffle".
Protect everyone!
Protect Pillowtown!
Jeffrey, you're not mediating.
Ah, Dean, what do you want me to say, huh?
I mean, some conflicts are so pointless, they just have to play themselves out.
Fine.
The Legit Republic of Blanketsburg says Pillowtown has until midnight tonight to surrender its territory.
The United Forts of Pillowtown declines the request.
It's not a request.
I'm giving you an "all tomato," meaning that you give me the whole tomato or else.
Or else what?
See you at midnight.
Oh, my God.
Do people go to classes?
The deadline divides friendships, families, even study groups.
Pierce Hawthorne takes Troy's side, citing that Abed is weirder and more foreign.
Shirley Bennett decides her allegiance in a text message to her husband.
I'll be home late, sugar boots.
Abed hurt Troy's feelings by being a robot.
Need to stay with my boy to make sure Britta doesn't put him on the weed.
Please record forensic files.
Troy appoints Shirley Bennett as his second-in-command, at which point, Pierce switches to Abed's side.
There were those who thought that midnight might come and go, and nothing would happen.
Well, I was in Korea, and I knew the sound of crap when it was about to hit the fan.
You know what it sounded like?
That's right, Jackson.
Silence.
Midnight comes, and a campus holds its breath.
I know there's a lot of blanket stackers and pillow packers out there thinking it's going to go down tonight.
But there's a lot of us folks from the scene in between saying, "Hey, we're all looking to chill out and lay down with someone special".
This is real Neil with pipes of steel, signing of with the smooth sounds of daybreak.
I gotta get this on film.
I am straight trouncing spaz in go fish.
Dude, what are you doing?
Don't record this.
Wait, did you hear that?
What the hell is that?
Blanketsburg soldiers charge a pillow fort in the library.
The pillowtonians move quickly to defend.
There were no rules in that first battle.
You hit someone, and if they went down, you stop hitting them.
Call that Common Courtesy.
Then what if they get up?
Do you maybe keep hitting them till they learn to stay down?
We call that Common Sense.
The battle lasts six minutes.
No territory changes hands.
Blanketsburg has drawn first blood.
Pillowtown will draw First Blood part II.
Citizens of Blanketsburg, I ask you now to prepare for war.
And I ask Garrett to please fix the microphone on my laptop.
It's doing that thing again.
The United Forts of Pillowtown and the Legit Republic of Blanketsburg are at war, each side attempting to kick down and replace the other.
The unmoving line between them is a campus-wide, fleece-laden strip of pillow-to-pillow combat.
Britta Perry attempts to capture the war's sublime indignities on film.
Unfortunately for Britta and millions of photographers like her, just because something is in black and white doesn't mean it's good.
Rules are agreed upon, but casualties are inevitable.
Outside the science lab, at the Battle of Big Bulletin Board, Pierce Hawthorne suffers broken glasses, a hurt finger, and erectile dysfunction, which, in his words, had never happened ever before that battle.
"Pillows, but no sleep.
"Feathers, but no birds.
"Pajamas without children.
"Violence without purpose.
I saw mommy kissing Exxon Mobil".
Amanda Johnson.
Poet by choice, lesbian by birth.
Even Jeff Winger, who, before the war, lacked interest in it, has now found a leading role.
Soldiers of Blanketsburg, we fight not because we want war.
We fight, - that we might gain peace!
- Yeah!
Winger's critics suggest he merely improvised hot-button patriotic dogma in a Ferris Bueller-ian attempt to delay schoolwork.
Winger decries the accusation as, "A slanderous betrayal akin to 9/11".
Later after the war, he would refer to the theory as "essentially accurate".
Annie Edison provides humanitarian relief for both sides.
Her text conversations with Jeff Winger give us a glimpse beneath the cushions of war to the lost pennies and grody q-tips of war's emotional toll.
"Jeff, heard from one of Troy's soldiers about a speech "you gave to troops at the blanket fort.
"Wish this war could be over.
But proud of you for taking a stance".
Text message.
Annie Edison.
"Thank you, Annie.
"I'm proud of you too and of us all.
"Also with the nightmare would end.
But using what I'm given to give what I can".
Jeff Winger.
"Jeff, just heard from one of Abed's soldiers "that you gave an identical speech to troops at Pillowtown.
"WTF?
Sad face.
Special icon of a downward thumb".
"Annie, okay, you caught me.
"I prefer war to homework.
"How do you do that little thumb icon?
I can't find it on my phone".
Jeff Winger.
"Jeff, you're disgusting.
"Troy and Abed's friendship is at stake.
"You can buy special icons and packages at the app store.
Piece of Sushi, birthday cake, stop sign, snowman, umbrella".
Annie Edison.
Pierce Hawthorne, humiliated in the Battle of Big Bulletin Board, wants a chance to redeem himself.
I'm working on something.
Look at this.
You can build this?
You just give me the pillows.
I hope to God we'll never have to use it.
Oh, me too.
Rumors of Hawthorne's weapon find their way to Troy.
Troy Barnes will take no chances.
He turns to Ben Chang, Greendale's chief of security, rumored to be literally psychotic, and who has been kept on the sidelines until this moment.
Go, go, go I'm a killer, man Aah!
Chang has recruited an army of preteen security interns while moonlighting at a local Bar Mitzvah.
They were later nicknamed "The Changlorious Basterds," like Inglourious Basterds, but with "Chang" instead of "In".
I don't get it either.
Most of the soldiers in this war hadn't fought with a pillow in years.
These little bastards.
Pillow fighting was a way of life for them.
One of the interns said they were making necklaces out of mattress tags.
This is when things get as ugly as they can get While still being a pillow fight.
"Crazy war, huh?
"I heard Chang's kids are really ducking stuff up.
"Hey, check it out.
I downloaded that thing.
"Birthday cake, birthday cake, unicorn, woman's shoe.
How's the nurse thing going"?
No response.
You guys like pillows?
How do you like these pillows?
The Changlorious Basterds have turned the war into a chaotic sea of high-thread-count terror.
Under advice from his top general, Abed sees no choice but to unleash his doomsday device.
You're going to die, you little bastards!
What the heck is that?
He is part man, part pillow All carnage.
Pierce Hawthorne has transformed himself into an unstoppably plush juggernaut.
Guys, guys, let's retreat.
Go, go!
"The war won't stop with First Blood part II.
"It will escalate to Rambo III, which should really be called First Blood part III.
"But the Rambo titles never made sense.
And neither does war".
Abed Nadir.

Leonard likes this post.
Why are you ignoring me?
What's the point of talking to you?
Your words don't mean anything.
They're just things you say to get what you want.
Well, that's what conversation is, Annie.
People saying things to get stuff.
Then maybe you should just shut up.
Do you ever just Write stuff down in a journal, Jeff?
One you don't show people or use to get anything with?
A place that's just for you to Sort out the truth?
If I write stuff down in a Hello Kitty book, will you like me again?
I'm taking that as yes.
The war brings out the worst in people.
Worse yet, Troy's forces intercept an e-mail written by Abed to his commanders, outlining Troy's weaknesses.
"Troy will hold on until he is broken emotionally.
"Fortunately, this will not be hard.
"He gets distracted by loud noises, "the color red, smooth jazz, shiny things "food smells, music boxes, bellbottoms, "boobs, barking dogs, and anyone saying, "Look over there"!
"He's insecure about his level of intelligence.
"His greatest vulnerability of all is his emotional frailty.
"It's incredibly easy to make him cry.
And he's incredibly ashamed of that fact".
Get away!
Unfortunately, the only photographer there to capture the scene is Britta Perry.
Yeah, gee.
There's a good one.
Pictured here lying down, Troy's does not take Abed's e-mail lying down.
"Hey, dick.
Read your dumb e-mail.
"Really enjoyed it.
Guess what?
"You may have been my best friend, "but we both know I was your first friend.
"And what I know but you don't know "because you have mental issues "is that you're never going to have another friend.
"Because all caps nobody else will ever have my patience with you".
Troy Barnes.
Four-part text message.
Word got around these two were now hurting each other's feelings.
And I thought about what Annie said, and then I thought about what I might do to make things right.
At 8:00 P.M. of the second night, both sides are honoring an agreed upon cease-fire so that the infantry can watch the hit TV show Ski, Shoot, Sing, a combination biathlon singing competition, which was no fun to watch time-shifted because then you'd be the last to know who won.
During the cease-fire, Jeff summons Troy and Abed to a secret summit meeting.
- This has to stop.
- Tell him.
Me?
What about your e-mail?
You weren't supposed to see that.
You weren't supposed to think those things.
Guys, look at yourselves.
You didn't used to be like this.
You were Troy and Abed.
Things used to be easy.
He's right.
Our friendship is dead.
What?
Yeah, I think we should agree right now that whoever wins this war can stay in the apartment.
Loser has to find a new place.
Agreed.
Uh, I wanted that to go different.
The North Cafeteria, named after admiral William North, is located in the western portion of East Hall, gateway to the western half of North Hall, which is named not after William North, but for its position above the South Wall.
It is the most contested and confusing battlefield on Greendale's campus, next to the English Memorial Spanish Center, named after English Memorial, a portuguese sailor that discovered Greendale while looking for a fountain that cured syphilis.
In a fit of hurt feelings, Troy redirects most of his infantry to the Cafeteria.
They arrive at the same time as 100 Pillowtown troops.
Just after dawn, the end of the war begins.
Aah!
Okay, I'm out.
I'm dead, I'm dead.
I'm dead.
I'm dead.
Well, that's it.
I just heard from the Guinness rep.
He's not coming.
He's been fired, in what he described as the world's biggest mistake.
I doubt that will make the next edition.
Anyway, it's over.
What a colossal waste of 2 1/2 days.
The war has no more reason to continue, and yet it does between the two that began it.
They just kept fighting.
Like, for hours.
Come on, guys.
Let's wrap this up.
I don't want to.
- Me neither.
- Why not?
This is going to be the last thing we ever do together.
We can't stop.
Doesn't that kind of solve your problem?
The realization that you like each other so much, you'd hit each other with pillows forever?
Knowing that doesn't feel like enough anymore.
Yeah.
We're grown-ups now.
We have grown-up problems.
That's very clear.
Unless You use those magical friendship hats that I got for you.
We're not stupid, Jeffrey.
We know you made those sarcastically.
Yes, yes.
And I will roll my eyes at both of you when I put them on your heads because that's the way I am.
But that's not the way you have to be.
We might be interested.
Okay, then.
Here's your magical Friendship Hat, and - Jeff.
- What?
You left the magical Friendship Hats at the Dean's office.
Right.
Of course.
I'll go get them.
So Jeff went out, and he stayed out long enough to make them believe he had gone back to the office.
That was a nice touch.
There you go.
Lucky no one grabbed them, huh?
Britta Perry is there to immortalize the moment on film Accidentally while trying to get a picture of the light hitting a stack of nearby waffles.
Pierce, take that off.
I can't hear you!
Your cheeks are in the way.
First entry in my stupid journal.
Today I had to run and get two imaginary Friendship Hats from an office.
I could've just walked around the corner and the come back, but for some reason, I actually went all the way back to where they were supposed to be.
One was crumpled up a bit.
That was Troy's.
The other was just a little dusty.
That was Abed's.
I fixed them up even though I was the only one watching because I settled on a truth today that's always going to be true.
I would do anything for my friends, which I think is how everyone in the world feels, which finally makes me understand war.
Guys I wasn't going to show this to anyone, but, uh, it's pretty profound.
I kind of nailed it.
If you want, I can read it in the documentary.
That is, unless you get Tom Hanks.
We tried to get Tom Hanks, but he's too expensive.
So we used the people involved for their own voiceover.
Yeah, and I nailed that too.
Why are you here at the same time as me?
Tight schedule.
- Hey, were you in The Cape?
- No.
Wow.
- Mm.
- I've got goosebumps.
Me too.
Such a great story.
I was on the edge of my seat, and I was in it.
You want to know what struck me while I was watching - that marvelous documentary?
- Hmm?
You can't get quality programming like that anywhere else but right here on Greendale Campus Television.
Just thinking that same thing.
Pillows and Blankets.
Or any of these other great specials, A Year in Paris.
The Annie's Boobs Story or That's Enter-Chang-Ment.
Folks, we know you hate these constant pledge drives.
We know you hate them.
We don't love doing them.
We don't like doing them either.
- I'd rather be at home right now.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, taking a warm bath with my wife.
But if you want to help us out, if you want to help Greendale Campus Television to stay on the air, keep the lights on.
We are literally this close to losing our
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Best friends, best friends Making a cake - Wait.
Ah.
Best friends, best friends making a cake - Pyoo!
I never thought I'd miss it.
How come I'm not best friends with anyone in the group?
Aw!
Don't patronize me.
Oh.
She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes, whoo-whoo Just letting the students know that if you're on campus this weekend, you'll have to park on the street because of the carnival.
On an unrelated note, I'm into trains now.
A real carnival?
Is the company called red beard's amusements?
Name rings a bell.
But with me, that could mean anything.
I wonder.
I have an ex-boyfriend that travels with a carnival.
I'm sorry, Britta.
Some things are funny because they make no sense.
And that is not one of them.
Well, it looks like my news has incited some doings.
And if that's not my job, what is?
Choo choo!
Well, you're also supposed to-- Eh.
Administrate the school.
So, Britta, tell us about your carnival worker boyfriend.
Why, so you all can get a big laugh?
- Yeah.
- I'd love to have a laugh.
The exact reason.
Fine.
I'm not ashamed of my past.
And if it entertains you guys, that's great because we're friends.
His name is Blade and What?
Oh, no, Britta!
She invoked friendship to undercut the laugh, and we're still laughing.
That's how funny it is!
His name is Blade.
Is that legal?
Shouldn't new line cinema be suing him?
He was called that before that stupid movie.
He was called that before the fantastic movie.
And it was a marvel comic in 1973.
Well, nerd alert.
Well, ex-boyfriend named Blade alert.
Her love life makes Pierce seem with it.
Her pain unifies us.
She has the king Arthur of bad taste in men.
I'm glad you guys are reacting this way.
I need to be reminded that he is the worst on earth.
Because if he comes through town and calls me, I will be there in five minutes.
- I don't understand.
- Uh, Andre much?
- Okay, I understand.
- I don't.
- You will.
- What's that mean?
- He's hung.
- Oh, God!
Pierce, you're disgusting.
Just like that I'm disgusting again.
I was one of the gang.
It was in my hand.
Sometimes, a woman meets a man that she just can't shake from her system no matter much she knows better.
I lucked out with Andre, but God help me.
As you all know, there's not a lot he couldn't get away with.
So what, Britta?
You're in love with a guy who's named after a kickboxing vampire movie?
A fantastic kickboxing vampire movie.
No, I don't believe in love because of this guy Named after a kickboxing vampire movie.
Oh, Britta!
Oh, sweetie.
You wanna watch Blade tonight?
Yes.
Give me some rope, time in a tree give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year Ugh, I love that I have a locker now.
All that wasted time going to my car for mid-afternoon wardrobe adjustments.
What do you think, hmm?
Stick with what's working?
You're gonna change your shirt?
Not if it's working.
- It's not working.
- Yeah.
You're right.
I knew it.
- I'll have what she's having.
- Hey, grow up, lady!
- Annie!
- His shirt wasn't working!
I need your help.
It Blade's carnival that's coming.
He's working the BB gun duck-shooting gallery.
I guess he finally got the promotion.
And he will call me.
And left unattended, I will end up doing him like a crossword, and I will regret it.
So I need you to take my phone, and don't give it back until Monday!
Of course.
Okay.
- For real?
- Pipe it!
And I need to stay with you this weekend.
Not just stay with you, I need to be on lockdown.
You were a pillhead, so think of Blade as Adderall.
And handcuff me to the radiator like a mother-flipping carny-banging werewolf.
I got this.
I got this.
Our apartment has central heating, but I get the idea-- stay strong.
Man, I wonder how many women I've affected this way.
Ha ha!
Whoo whoo!
All aboard the human being railway!
Next stop, spo-- - I'll get to the point.
I'd like your student Troy Barnes enrolled in the air conditioning repair program immediately.
Oh, a wonderful opportunity for a young man of Urban race.
Yet try as I might, I'm unable to make him see it that way.
I need you to change his mind.
But if he's not interested, what can I do?
Dean, have we forgotten that your school is under the ac repair school's thumb?
Uh, we have not.
Then mine is not to tell you how to do what I want done.
Mine is to want and to say my want.
Yours is to know and to do.
I know exactly what to do.
Natalie, could you get me a, um, book on how to do things?
You know what, just make me a scotch and soda.
- Make it yourself!
- I don't know how.
I love Blade's special Blade weapons.
Yeah, see that sword?
It has two blades.
One blade is silver, the other blade is infused with garlic.
- I should check my messages.
- No.
Guys, could we maybe watch a different movie or just stop saying that word six times per minute?
- What word?
- Blade.
Oh, because of Britta's ex-boyfriend.
Can you check my messages for me and tell me if he called?
I don't think that's a good idea.
What if my mother died?
You guys are really talking over Blade.
- Not cool!
- Annie, subdue your guest.
Annie, think for one second.
You have my phone, and you're not even checking it.
What if my mother is dying?
This is junkie talk.
You just wanna know where your phone's hidden.
I just wanna know if my mother is dying.
It's a simple yes or no.
I'll cover my eyes.
You go check my phone and say, "No, your mother isn't dying" or "Yes, your mother is dying," and then we go back to watching the film.
Give it to me!
That's right, Britta.
It's a banana.
Why is there a banana in your DVD cabinet?
Read the banana, Britta.
"You are a lying junkie".
I'm sure those words hurt.
But you wouldn't be reading them if they weren't true.
I am so weak.
But we are not defined by our limitations.
We are defined by our potentials.
I have the potential to watch Blade.
You two are bad friends!
Bad.
That's unfair.
What about you guys?
Okay, you don't like our movie, we can't say the word "Blade," there's phones in the refrigerator.
Oops.
- Troy, Abed!
- Let me see if he called!
I have a right to know!
You're monsters!
You're Hitlers!
You're racist pedophiles!
You're the opposites of Batman!
You don't know what that means.
Gonna rip out your throats and eat your-- Still think the lock was overkill?
No.
There's phones in the refrigerator.
It's you.
Boys' night!
I need help reacting to something.
Hi!
I heard it's just a quick icky play.
You tell anyone we did this, I will stop letting you do things with me I'm afraid to tell anyone about.
Hey, I get it.
You wanna take a look at Britta's ex-boyfriend.
If you did it by yourself, you'd be weird.
You're the only one that really understands me.
Oh, funky.
Ha!
What, are you guys on a date?
Pretty awkward.
Look what Pierce won me.
What is this?
I decided to go outside the group for a best friend.
And you couldn't do better than Chang?
You take that back!
He could do plenty better than me.
I was the first to say yes.
Well, have fun forcing life.
We will.
What do you wanna do next?
- Cotton candy?
- Russian roulette?
- What did you say?
- Cotton candy sounds great.
Oh, thank you.
That's it?
Huh.
Hmm.
He's not as good-looking as you.
- I wasn't fishing for that.
- No, no, no.
I offered it freely.
Come on, I wanna go on a ride.
This is a window for me.
I spent my carnival years pregnant.
Shirley, I'm not jealous.
I just wanted to see what the deal was.
Obviously the deal is he's a dirtball, Britta hates herself, voila.
What do you wanna do?
I'd like to go on a ride.
Let's go shoot some ducks.
Jeffrey!
Eight of clubs.
I win.
Nice!
- How are you feeling?
- Good.
Great, actually.
Thank you, Annie.
I could've never done this without you.
I'm glad to be able to help you.
I want you to know-- and I've never said these words-- but I've always felt them.
You're a sister to me.
Britta!
Whoo!
Hey, little sis, do you think you could trust me to have my phone back now?
I've got my email on there, my calendar, homework assignments.
I'm kinda screwed without it.
You're not just manipulating me, right?
Oh, because of Oh, jeez.
Yeah, whatever.
That's over, Annie.
Seriously.
Okay, I have it right here.
It's a gateway to further trust.
Perfect.
Thank you.
Love the gateway.
Honoring the gateway.
I have to call my doctor for some results.
Don't worry, I'm fine.
It's just a little personal.
You need privacy, sure thing.
I'll check on you later.
Bye.
Thank you, sweetie.
Boy, this guy doesn't give vampires a square inch of leeway.
He's harsh.
What's wrong, Annie?
You came out of the bedroom smiling, and then your smile faded as you leaned against the door.
I gave Britta her phone.
You did?
Why?
She needs to feel trust to recover, or she'll relapse.
She's gonna relapse because you gave her her phone.
No, I secretly switched Blade's number in her phone to my number.
So if she tries to get in touch with him, - it'll come to me.
- That's diabolical.
Yeah, you're just like Blade, man.
Straight up.
I just hope she can find the strength to-- She's probably just telling him she'sdying to feel the warmth of his Are you kidding me?
She said we were sisters.
I am so sad right now.
And she is so codependent!
And such a bad speller.
Nice shootin'.
Tough luck.
Thanks.
I'll go another round.
There's room in our bed for three bears, right, honey?
And then some, sugar.
You're very nice For a man named What'd you say it was?
Blade?
Yup.
But that's a carnival name though, right?
A nom de corn dog?
Why would I have a carnival name?
Your parents named you Blade?
Apparently.
Well, you seem okay with it.
Not much to do about it.
You could change it.
To what?
Templeton Ferrari III?
Won't change how mustard tastes.
I'll be right back.
Huh.
Won't change how mustard tastes.
I get it.
I see the appeal.
He's relaxed, he's cool.
N-not as cool as you.
Mr. Blade.
I want three more rounds.
Jeffrey!
Not gonna change the way mustard tastes.
Oh, and you're so cool, Shirley.
Sometimes I am.
How many times are they gonna do that?
Aw, this is it, isn't it?
We're becoming best friends.
I think so.
I think so.
Would you let me be your best friend I would call you every day Oh, my God!
One after the other!
"I'm texting to tell you I'm not texting you any more.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
"Are you mad at me now?
Fine.
I guess you don't wanna know our two-year-old".
Can we please just put it under a stack of mattresses or something?
I don't know.
When is she gonna take a hint?
Britta's attracted to unavailable men.
- Dean, why are you here?
- Ouch.
Fine.
Let's make him available.
- What are you doing?
- Ending this.
- "Leave me alone".
- No!
That's so much worse.
See?
She stopped.
She's calling him?
She was born in the '80s.
She still uses her phone as a phone.
- Uh-oh.
- That's fine, it's fine.
- We just won't answer it.
- Won't it go to your voicemail?
Hello?
Blade?
There you go.
I don't know!
Change your settings so it doesn't go to voicemail.
Too late.
You guys act like a carnival.
Be a carnival.
Now!
- Step right up!
- Ding, ding, ding!
Get your popcorn here.
- Hello?
- Busy, babe.
Blade, just wait.
Wait, Bla I told you not to call me at work!
"I'm sorry, I forgot.
Don't be mad at me".
She's whipped by an imaginary douche.
Hey, don't knock it till you try it.
I got my fake bachelor's degree, and then I cheated on the LSAT.
You're probably wondering, how do you cheat on the LSAT?
How?
A magician never reveals his secrets, my friend.
Ah.
- Yeah!
In your face!
- Good job.
Uh, give me the big one!
Yeah, that's the one.
Yeah.
Not too shabby, huh?
Yeah, you really did it, baby.
So you dropped out of high school and joined the carnival.
And 15 years later, here you are.
- Jeffrey!
- Guess that's about it.
So what's the record?
What's the best anyone's ever done in this booth?
- I guess eight ducks.
- All right, one more round.
One more round.
- Jeff?
- Honey?
Will you excuse us just for a moment, please?
Certainly.
Can you get over here?
- What is your end game here?
- I don't know.
- I wanna know.
- Wanna know what?
I wanna know what drove Britta crazy about him.
Are you jealous?
Are you in love with Britta?
No, I am not in love with Britta.
And yes, I'm insanely jealous of him.
What's his secret?
Why do you wanna know the secret to making a woman psycho?
Why do we wanna know how to blow up the earth or grow a human ear on a mouse?
In case we have to, Shirley.
In case we have to.
- I'm going to find Pierce.
- Good!
One of those bears is mine!
So this is best friendship.
Something else, isn't it?
How do we keep it going?
How do we know we won't get into a fight?
I say we just let it happen.
Don't tell me what to do!
- What's your problem?
- What's yours?
I'm outta here!
This is the last time this is the last time I'll see you smile good-bye my friend I'll miss you every night good-bye Blade, 'sup?
Message.
Okay.
We can stop worrying about voicemail now.
Back to the matter at hand.
Now what are you doing?
- Dean, why are you here?
- Yikes.
I figured it out.
I know exactly what to do.
I'm just gonna be really, really, really mean to her.
Uh.
What don't you get about the concept?
Britta likes guys who are mean to her.
She doesn't like herself.
Give me the phone.
What did you say?
Something nice.
Don't worry about it.
I'm deleting it from your phone.
- Hi.
- What's up?
You guys still watching movies?
Hi, Dean.
Why are you here?
Hi, Britta.
And ouch.
And you don't know anything about carpentry.
- Nope.
- Or aquariums-- freshwater or saltwater.
- Do you have a big weiner?
- Nope.
I don't get it, Blade!
What's your secret?
Why do I wanna impress you?
Are you dumb or smart?
Are you a loser or winner?
Or are you just a human mirror?
Do we all see what we wanna see in you?
A magician never reveals, right?
Right.
Later.
Okay.
You dropped over 300 bucks on my booth, so I'll tell ya.
You wanna know my secret?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
What are you doing?
I wanna know.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I was texting with Blade, but it's over now.
He'sa loser.
Good night.
Uh, uh, uh Troy!
You should really join the air conditioning repair program.
- No.
- Well, that didn't work.
That's what I get for improvising.
Good night.
So I don't get it.
He's a vampire, but he can walk around during the day?
- Whatis wrong with you?
- Huh?
You weren't texting Blade, you were texting us.
I switched Blade's number in your phone to mine.
- You tricked me?
- You tricked me!
You ask for my help, you tell me I'm your sister, I do everything I can to make you hate this turd, and the first nice thing he says, and you're over him?
Who are you?
And why didn't it stick?
I was texting with you guys this whole time?
So Bladeisn't a loser!
Uh-oh.
No, let her go.
Lost cause, man.
Jeff!
What are you doing here?
I just got back from the carnival Where I met Blade.
Is he okay?
How is he?
He's brain damaged.
- Well, let's not be petty.
- No, I'm serious.
He showed me the scar.
Ten years ago, before he even met you, a loose bolt flew off a Ferris wheel and imbedded in his skull, destroying the part of his brain that feels shame.
He's basically irresistible to people for the same reason he can pretty much only work at a carnival.
He has nothing to prove or disprove about himself or to himself.
He has no shame.
Why wouldn't he have told me that?
Because he didn't care if you knew.
That is so like him.
- I have to go to him.
- No, woman.
None of us have to "go to" anyone.
And the idea we do is a mental illness we contracted from breath mint commercials and Sandra bullock.
We can't keep going to each other until we learn to go to ourselves.
Stop making our hatred of ourselves someone else's job and just stop hating ourselves.
Annie, I want you to take my phone.
Do not let me call Chang.
I'm locking myself in your room.
What are you guys doing out here?
Self-actualizing.
Well, it's loud.
Come watch Blade.
Okay.
This movie is fantastic.
Y'all ever notice that cold spot in the hallway?
Oh, yeah!
That thing is freezing!
You know what could learn a lesson from that cold spot?
The air conditioning unit in my living room.
Ladies and gentlemen, so yesterday, typical Sunday.
I was hanging out in my dreamatorium.
Whoo!
This ever happen to you guys?
I couldn't remember where I imagined the door.
Then I realized I was in an actual bathroom.
Uh, no offense, but this material seems pretty specific to your apartment.
I don't think it'll work at an open mic.
Y'all ever notice the difference between me and Troy brushing our teeth?
I brush my teeth like this.
Troy brushes his teeth like this.
I do!
I do!
I brush my teeth just like that.
Now you know what I'm gonna talk about next.
Toaster oven!
It's from his album.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
We are so screwed.
How are we gonna memorize all this?
Let's just go over it again.
Kingdom, phylum, class Order, family, genus, species.
I use a mnemonic device.
"Kevin, please come over for gay sex".
Why wouldn't you use "Karen"?
'Cause it's gay sex, dummy.
So use "great".
Now I can't remember anything.
Thanks!
God, why do we always wind up in this position?
For all the time you spend here, you'd think we wouldn't have to cram so much.
Maybe we never get any work done because we have so much fun hanging out together.
Definitely, maybe that's why.
Ah, the duali-Dean of man.
I'm dressed this way because I have good news and bad news.
You have got to be kidding me.
The bad news is Professor Kane has the flu.
The good news is biology class is canceled After you.
What a gentleman.
Guys, we don't have to cram last minute anymore.
Last minute got moved to tomorrow.
Three-hour lunch?
Three-hour lunch?
Three-hour lunch?
Three hours?
I could watch the first half of three movies.
Ooh, I don't have to go to the fast food restaurant across the street.
I can go to the fancy one across town.
Their manager wears a tie.
If we don't eat, we can make-believe an whole episode's worth of Inspector Spacetime - in the Dreamatorium.
- Word.
Yeah.
Maybe we should go to SeÃ±or Kevin's.
Britta, didn't you want to try that new cage-free bean burrito?
The tortillas are made with micro-financed flour.
Troy, you could drive.
You always like that spiral parking ramp.
You just keep turning left, but you end up up!
I can't go to SeÃ±or Kevin's.
The manager and I are enemies.
He said Die Hard was bad.
- He said Die Hard was bad.
- I know, buddy.
Well, how about this.
This lunch is already a runaway train, no point in stopping it.
Troy, Britta, you go to SeÃ±or Kevin's.
Abed promised he'd show me how the Dreamatorium works.
- Today's the perfect day for it.
- But I want to Abed, don't you think today's - the perfect day for it?
- No.
- Abed.
- Is this a social cue?
I left my Puttin' On the Ritz cane in here earlier.
I know it probably has another name, but, um, can I be perfectly honest with you guys?
I think I went too far with this one.
I have to go to the bank today.
What am I supposed to tell people in line?
"I had good news and bad news"?
Come on, Craig.
Get you life together.
Give me some more, time in a dream give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away Sync & Corrections by Elderfel I am Inspector Spacetime.
And I know that which is unknown.
Duty-bound to protect a universe of innocent unremarkables, I patrol it in the x7 Dimensionizer with my loyal constable, Reggie.
This week, however, Reggie has been forced to go to lunch.
So I'm aboard the much crappier H.M.S. Spacetime 12, from the worst season ever, with temporary constable, Geneva.
Geneva, I need the quantum spanner, the big one.
Oi, gov'ner, quantum spammer, up an' at 'em, in'it?
If we can't get out of orbital lock, the Blorgons may intercept.
Tut tut, m'lord.
Wouldn't give a tuppence for that sticky wicket.
Okay, stop simulation.
More British?
I can't do this anymore.
But the Blo-gons might intercept It's Blorgons with an "r".
Blo-gon means "thank you" in blorgon.
Can't we play something I know about like hospital administration?
You're mad at me for playing matchmaker with Troy and Britta.
You think you're gonna lose Troy.
I'm not petty, Annie.
I'm mad at you because you tampered with the fabric of the group.
How do you know Troy and Britta pairing up wouldn't destroy everything?
I run the scenarios.
I examine this stuff from every conceivable angle.
Oh, and you can do that but I can't?
You don't have a patent on being a control freak, Abed.
I kind of do.
You think this is just a room where Troy and I play dinosaurs versus river boat gamblers together?
Sure, it's how I got the construction approved, but, much like myself, the Dreamatorium has higher functions.
Would you like me to show you how your stunt with Troy and Britta will play itself out?
Why not?
Execute simulation Troy/Britta.
Render environment SeÃ±or Kevin's.
Oh, those appetizers were dope and legit!
I don't usually support lunch because it's unfair to breakfast.
I never thought about meals fighting each other.
I guess that explains why you never see any two of them on the same table.
So I guess Annie's pretty hot to get us together.
She probably just doesn't understand people.
Well, the sooner the food comes, the sooner this will be over.
I'm afraid your food won't be ready for another half hour.
I'm too busy misunderstanding the whole point of Die Hard.
I can't wait to get home to Abed.
So you can dart back and forth doing impressions of your friends.
There's no science at work here.
You're right.
The science is at work in here.
This is the Dreamatorium's engine.
My thoughts are collected by this box and everything I know about my friends is stored here.
Both are distilled by logic and then recombined into objective observation.
I'm able to simulate any of the study group and even a half-accurate Chang in over 7,000 unique situations.
Abed, it's cardboard tubes and a funnel.
Well you see it that way because it's calibrated to a specific level of brain function.
Right.
I'm stupid.
Not stupid, just less able to see what I see.
Gee, you've got it all figured out.
King of toilet paper rolls over here.
Hey, Troy, I'm glad you called.
Your lunch is going well, right?
Yeah, just checking on Abed.
Making sure he's okay.
What?
He's fine.
He just implied I operate on a lower level of brain function, so business as usual.
Great, um, just, you know, make sure he stays comfortable.
I worry about him when I'm not around.
Well, he's fine, he always will be.
People bend over backwards to cater to him.
He's just extra sensitive in the Dreamatorium.
It takes a lot out of him to run that thing.
I don't want you to break his brain.
Bye, Troy.
- How is he?
- He'll be okay.
It's so sweet how much you care about him.
And another thing I hate about Die Hard, two FBI agents named Johnson.
I've been thinking about our Inspector Spacetime scenario.
It might work better if instead of playing Geneva, you played Rosamund.
She was a constable in season five and she only had three lines.
I have a better idea.
You know what would make your scenarios a lot more realistic?
If Troy weren't on a date.
Why don't you take all your thoughts and your logic and add one step to the process.
- What are you doing?
- From now on, before you do or say anything, you're gonna think about how it affects the people around you.
We lower functioning brains call this "empathy".
Abed?
Abed?
Oh, my God, I broke Abed.
Abed?
You know how you wanted me to tell you when you were being scary weird instead of cute weird?
This is scary weird.
Hello, Annie.
What was I doing on the floor?
Were we doing it?
Are you being Jeff?
Well, I'm not being a Kardashian.
So where are we now?
We're in the doctor's lounge of Greendale Hospital School.
Hospital school?
It's a sexy emotional school where doctors save lives and make love, often simultaneously.
Our stories, ripped from the headlines.
Our passions, unbridled.
Our cafeteria, eh Make love to me, Ann.
I know I'm just a surgeon and you're a hotshot upstart administrator, but damn the rules, damn the system, damn our two foot height disparity, I want you.
Okay, Abed, I get it, we have different sensibilities.
Later.
Bye.
I'm leaving.
Okay, Dr. Jeff, can you please tell me where I can find Abed?
I owe him an apology.
Abed?
Never heard of him.
Terrific.
I asked you a question, doctor.
I'm a surgeon!
And I'm your administrator!
I left my wife for you and she was pregnant!
Who do you think inseminated her?
Now tell me what I want to know or God as my witness, I'll have your stethoscope.
Fine.
Dr. Perry might know.
Render environment bio lab.
Look, there's Britta and Troy fooling around with each other.
Look, there's Abed having overcome his issues.
Nice try.
Dr. Barnes, Dr. Perry.
We just saved an uninsured homeless man's life.
Using an unapproved procedure.
Now, we're going to kiss.
This is what you think I want?
What do you want, administrator?
I want to talk to Abed.
There's no one here by that name.
- You're lying.
- Maybe I am, so what?
I was raised on the mean streets of Harlem.
I'm not scared of you.
Well, be scared of this.
Sodium pentothal, known commonly as truth serum.
I saw Abed's name in the hospital school files, I love butt stuff, I hate spiders, I stole a pen from the bank, I cried during About a Boy The soundtrack I don't wash my hands before surgery.
I can see why women find Clive Owen attractive to the point where I might just as well be attracted to him.
I use comparisons to Hitler to win arguments on the Internet at the drop of a hat.
I know nothing about wine.
I'm more turned on by women in pajamas than lingerie.
I just want to know they feel comfortable.
I didn't get Inception.
I didn't get Inception.
You said you saw his name in the files.
There's so many layers.
Right, render environment medical study room.
There's head nurse, Shirley, talking to tragic, heart-wrenching Alzheimer's patient and Emmy-contender, Pierce Hawthorne.
Mr. Hawthorne, you're out of your bed again.
'Cause I think I'm on a train.
Oh!
Oh!
Shirley, get me the file on Abed.
Abed doesn't exist, young lady.
He exists if I say so.
This is my hospital school.
Your hospital school, young lady, is a simulation being run through a filter of other people's needs.
Abed's been filtered out because nobody needs him.
I need him.
Well you're not simulated.
No, but this is!
Ooh!
And there's more where that didn't come from.
This is a private compartment.
- Jeff, get the files.
- Why me?
Because you can see the cabinets.
And I'll make love to you.
Jackpot.
There is an Abed in this hospital school, but he's not a doctor.
He's a patient.
- Notify security!
- Conductor!
Jeff, take me to Abed.
Where is that?
Enough games, just take me where I wanna go.
Follow me.
Are we close?
Almost there, although you should probably run in place and let the hall move around you.
- Here we are.
- Where?
Where you wanted to go.
The last night of school, first year.
The night we kissed.
Ababed wasn't there, so whose memory is this?
Maybe it's yours.
Maybe the Dreamatorium really works.
Or maybe Leonard was watching from the bushes and told Abed about it.
I don't have cable.
Knock it off, Abed.
I'm not Abed.
You're confused, so was I. But not anymore.
Jeff Abed, stop!
I don't wanna do this.
I want to talk to Abed.
I'm taking the file.
Oh, it says Abed is in the recovery parlor.
Condition never better.
You're not holding anything.
This is the file.
Abed Nadir, psychiatric patient 1373, control freak with no empathy.
People bend over backwards to cater to him.
Signed, healthcare administrator Annie Edison.
That's out of context.
Shh.
You've thought of everything, Annie.
With Abed gone and Troy and Britta together, there's nothing standing in the way of us.
Wait, what?
Come on.
This is you dream.
This is why you played matchmaker.
This is what's important to you.
You are not Jeff.
Because Jeff cares about Abed.
And I did not push Troy and Britta together so this would happen.
I did it because I thought they were cute together and this would have been a bonus.
And we are not here.
And I'm not staying here because I hate whoever you are.
You should probably storm off in Oh!
In place.
Where do you wanna go next?
I wanna be alone.
Sounds good to me.
Execute simulation, Annie/Annie.
There.
Now we're alone.
Great, so you're me now.
Why are you blowing our magic moment with Jeff?
It's not magic.
It's not even real.
But we love Jeff.
No, we don't.
We're just in love with the idea of being loved.
And if we can teach a guy like Jeff to do it, we'll never be unloved.
So we keep running the same scenario over and over hoping for a different result.
Running scenarios.
Careful now.
You're starting to sound like Abed.
So I probably shouldn't say things like "Star Wars.
Zardoz, Cougar Town, cool, cool, cool".
- Stop it.
- Pop culture, pop culture.
- I'm on a TV show.
- You're gonna get in trouble.
Meta, meta.
It's Abed!
I got an Abed here!
Get him!
That's it.
I find you guilty of being Abed.
You're under arrest!
Can I just interject and say I don't know what the hell's going on?
This time you'll never get out.
Abed?
Abed.
Yeah.
I found you by turning into you, how cool is that?
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Tell me where we are so I can pretend to see it.
We're inside a locker.
It's where I spent a lot of time in junior high.
You think this is where we'd put you?
- You know that's absurd, right?
- Well, I'm not stupid.
You can see I've increased the square footage.
It's a metaphorical locker.
It's a place where people like me get put when everyone's finally fed up with us.
Abed, so maudlin.
If you start turning into a vampire I've run the simulations, Annie.
I don't get married, I don't invent a billion dollar website that helps people have sex.
I don't make in into Sundance, Slamdance or Dance Pants.
Troy invents Dance Pants in 2019.
Don't tell him, he needs to stumble onto it.
All right, listen.
The scenarios you run in here are like great science fiction.
They're impressive and detailed and insightful, but they're not accurate for crap.
Science fiction never has been.
Look at 2001.
Did we have a space odyssey?
No, we got snowboarding in the Olympics and we over-validated Carson Daily.
- That poor guy.
- Yeah, cry me a river.
My point is, your simulations are nothing more than anxieties.
You're afraid you don't fit in.
You're afraid you'll be alone.
Great news you share that with all of us, so you'll never be alone and you'll always fit in.
And, yes, that's why I meddled with Troy and Britta.
You caught me.
I was trying to make life go according to some script.
I can't.
You can't.
We both need to get more comfortable winging it.
At least it'll be less work.
It would cut down my Dreamatorium time by 18 hours a week.
I could take up yoga.
You've got the body type.
Now let's get you out of here.
I don't know how.
These fake shackles don't have a fake key.
Isn't that what a quantum spanner's for?
Technically, no.
But that's fine.
So should we get back to lunch?
I guess so.
A little more anticlimactic than I would have simulated it, - but whatever.
- Anticlimactic?
Render environment observo-deck, H.M.S. Spacetime 12.
Inspector, set the tachyon drive to hyperjump.
We must get to the other side of this star field before the Blorgons intercept.
Blorgons in this sector?
Well, this mission has gone pear-shaped, indeed.
Prepare to hyperjump on my mark.
Bugger the dovecoats, inspector.
We're too late!
Blorgons!
Eradicate!
Eradicate!
Our quantum blasters are useless against their armor.
We're as cooked as Lord Nelson's mutton, we are.
Not if I can help it.
I'll see you on the other side inspector Wherever that is.
Don't you mean "whenever that is"?
Take that, Blorgon scum!
You'll blo-gon me for this later.
Ow, Annie!
Oh, oh, my God!
Abed, I'm so sorry.
No, no, you're committing.
This is good stuff.
Thanks.
I am Abed Nadir And I don't know a lot of things everyone else knows.
I wander the universe with my friend, Troy, doing whatever I want.
Sometimes accidentally hurting innocent unremarkables.
This week, however, Troy went to lunch and I adapted.
I now have the ability to enter the minds of others.
- I'm hungry, are you hungry?
- Yeah.
I'll make us buttered noodles.
Using an elusive new technique known as "empathy".
So was the other fast food place worth the drive, Shirley?
You know, half way there I thought, "What am I doing?
It's the same fast food place in a different location.
Have the margins of my life become so narrow"?
So I went to the mall and had pizza.
Sounds like this has been a game-changing day for all of us.
I almost sat on my balls, but at the last second, I made an adjustment.
- Good job!
- Good work.
Good job, man.
Well, we had a good lunch, too.
Yeah.
I spoke to the manager about Die Hard, and I told him he should be ashamed of himself.
Thanks.
Sorry I bailed on the Dreamatorium.
It's okay, Annie did pretty good in a pinch.
All right, back to cramming?
The people at the bank loved my outfit.
And they had all kinds of questions about it and my answers seemed to amuse and and even liberate them a little.
A few of us went to lunch and I had the deepest conversation of my life.
I gotta go, I'm telling everybody.
Hmm, maybe after a long, dark night, the sun is starting to rise on Greendale.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
You never can tell what kind of day you're gonna have.
Okay, I didn't really avoid sitting on them.
I sat right on them.
- Oh.
- Aw.
- I'm sorry.
- Pierce, I'm sorry.
Hurt like hell.
I saw eagles.
Troy and Abed in the morning Today we're joined by Annie Edison - Hi!
- Who's gonna show us how to spruce up your apartment on a budget.
So, Annie, what inspired this throw?
Well, I just thought that I'd cover up the stain where Abed spilled code red on the couch last week.
Oops.
Crafty.
And you have some tips on entertaining.
Yes, if you're expecting company, but you don't have enough chairs, you can bring out pillows from your bedroom and use them on the floor for a Moroccan feel.
- Ooh, a taste of the Orient.
- Ooh!
Actually, boys, I have a little surprise for you.
- Uh-oh.
- While you two were out playing blazer tag That's laser tag with sport coats.
I did a little extreme bedroom makeover!
I unbunked your beds and got scrap fabric and It's okay, buddy.
We can put it back.
We can put it back the way it was.
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
It's cut, Garrett.
Sorry!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Greendale Community College is represented by two separate, yet equally important types of people: The goofballs that run around stirring up trouble, and the eggheads that make a big deal out of it.
These are their stories.
You'll be better off without her.
She was perfect.
Warm, smart, beautiful.
I'm never gonna find another dental hygienist like that.
Well, you should stop hitting on her.
Hey, she's the one putting her hands in my mouth.
Hey!
Over here.
Move along, nothing to see here.
That's the first time those words have actually been true.
Ms. Edison, when you called me down here at midnight, I expected more than a yam.
Specifically since you said, "There's been a murder".
Our yam was murdered.
If it's any consolation, she got me here on a very misleading text message.
Jeff, technically, you are about to be screwed in the biology room because our final project has been destroyed.
All right, look, I'm sorry for your loss.
I know you guys put the work in, so you'll get a passing grade.
A passing grade?
Like a "C"?
Why don't I just get pregnant at a bus station?
That was going to be an A-plus yam.
I can't give an A-plus to everyone whose yam falls of a counter.
Somebody did this to us.
In science, we call that a hypothesis.
You find something to back it up and we can talk.
Now if you'll excuse me, I was watching Mama's Family.
What happened?
Our yam was killed.
But Professor Kane says we can still get an "A" - if we figure out who did it.
- He did not say that.
He basically did.
You let me handle the nitty gritty.
In the meantime, I need somebody to drum up suspects.
I can help you with that.
I watch crime shows when I'm bored.
You boys, canvas for witnesses, establish a time frame and motive and bring me a suspect.
You've got 48 hours before the trail runs cold, so start with the last person to see that yam alive.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Understood.
It's been a long 15 years.
Looks like it's gonna be a late night.
How'd we manage to pull the short straw?
It's not a short straw.
It's a hot potato.
Yeah, well, looks pretty cold to me.
Cold?
Or dead?
- Survey says - We can't both do the zinger.
Sorry.
Okay, okay, five-to-one on the black guy.
That's offensive.
Fine, six-to-one.
Hello, boys.
Youth!
Scatter!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, Pierce.
Mind if we ask you a couple of questions?
Sure, I always say you guys should ask me more questions.
Did you water our biology yam last night?
Of course I watered it.
It was my turn, wasn't it?
I hold up my end.
Did you hold it or drop it?
Okay, whoa, I had nothing to do with that.
I-I couldn't even get in the room.
Make up your mind, Pierce.
Did you water the yam or weren't you there?
Okay, I lied about watering it.
I got there too late, the doors were already locked.
Why were you late?
I fell asleep in a sunbeam.
- Likely story.
- Actually it is.
I used to live with him, it's kind of adorable.
Look, why are you looking at me for this?
It was my yam too.
You should be talking to somebody who would wanna hurt us.
- And who's that?
- Duh-doy!
Todd.
Last night, I was home by 9:15, helped Elly with her geography and then went straight to bed.
Sounds like you keep a pretty tight schedule.
A valuable side effect of military service.
In Iraq, keeping a tight schedule saved lives.
Ah, what happened, Todd?
Cut yourself on an extra sharp Oscar Wilde play?
Oh, this?
It's a burn.
Home ec class.
Muffin.
What kind of muffin?
- Blueberry.
- Why not raisin?
That wasn't the assignment.
You can dance all day, Todd, but sooner or later, the music's gonna change.
Look, even if I wanted to hurt your yam, I couldn't.
I went by the bio room at 8:10 to chart my yam's growth.
The door was already locked.
There's a lot of that going around.
- Oh, yeah.
- It's true.
I had to take a picture of my yam through the door.
See?
Your yam was fine when I left.
I transferred or "downloaded" Todd's photograph to this computer and as you'll see, with a few adjustments, I can make the entire image old west color.
I don't know.
I thought it was cool.
Britta, zoom in there.
There's a clock on the wall.
- Eight plus two times five - Ten after 8:00.
I'm gifted in other ways.
That jibes with everyone else we talked to.
It seems like the classroom door gets locked at 8:00.
Which means whoever did the crime Got in there before the doors were locked and stayed there for hours.
I was gonna say, "Had a key".
Last year, I came in after hours a couple of times to finish a piÃ±ata for advanced Spanish.
I had to borrow a key from the front office.
And sign a log.
I can also help.
As a psych major, I could pr Any student can check out a key as long as they're currently taking classes and show school I.D. The guy we're looking for had a key to the bio room Monday night.
Monday night?
Rings a bell.
I'll check the log.
Sorry, this place is a mess.
Is this about your yam?
I heard about that.
It's a damn shame.
- Mine just bloomed yesterday.
- Congratulations.
Ooh, there she is.
Monday night, one biology room key checked out by Magnitude.
So you're saying you did check out a key, but it was inside your backpack when someone stole it off a table in the library while you were using the bathroom and you haven't seen it since.
Pop pop!
Perfect, so now we gotta solve a robbery too.
Well, whoever did it likes to steal backpacks off tables in the library.
Only one way to catch a dirtbag like that.
Well, time to visit the restroom.
I found that backpack.
Hey, idiot, guess what.
We don't care about the backpack.
Dead yam, big deal.
Order some ketchup.
That doesn't make sense.
You don't order ketchup.
It's a condiment!
Troy, Troy, hey, walk it off!
Troy, walk it off!
Sorry, my friend, he's a bad cop.
- Yeah.
- I'm a good cop.
- Oh, good.
- You can trust me.
Okay, well hey!
I'm not falling for that.
And you got nothing on me.
And I don't have to stay here, 'cause you're not cops.
He's right.
You're not cops.
I'd say our hands are tied, but we basically have no hands.
But he's our man though, right?
Well he ain't innocent.
Look, I'll try to keep him busy.
You guys go to the lab, see if they figured out how our yam met its masher.
I can both see and hear you.
The yam's vascular cylinder is completely disintegrated.
Any possibility it happened naturally?
Sure, if the gardener's Joseph Mengele.
Look at the root system.
This level of smushing is consistent with someone stepping on the yam after it was dropped.
So whoever did this was angry.
Hey, I just cut 'em open.
You want motive, talk to a shrink.
What I can tell you is that for a raw yam to get it this bad, you need more than gravity.
You need a boot.
We have to tell Professor Kane.
There's nothing here to connect to Star-Burns.
He'd have to confess.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Maybe if we ask him nice, he'll write us a love letter too.
Well, whoever did do this does owe you guys a letter.
An "A".
This yam was about to bloom.
Damn.
We named the yam "Pam".
It rhymed.
Even if we could prove that Star-Burns stole Magnitude's key, it's not enough.
But we know Star-Burns did it.
Keep the change, Garret.
You know what?
Keep the hot dog.
You're telling me after all this, our suspect's gonna slip away on the technicality that we're not police?
Okay, look, you don't need authority to get a confession.
You need leverage.
Something to hold over his head.
- Like what?
- He's Star-Burns.
Break into his locker.
You'll find enough dirt to bury him.
Jeff, that's not ethical.
Oh, so now you're finding your softness?
I say do what you have to do.
It's too late to get compassionate.
We only have time to get justice.
I really shouldn't be doing this.
And you're sure you heard a kitten meowing in here?
Not anymore, so hurry up.
Whoa, Nelly!
Clean up on aisle "busted".
Why do they always r Why do they always - You go ahead.
- Why do they always run?
There you go.
Move!
Not police business!
Hey, knock much?
- Kiss me!
- What?
I'll explain later.
- No.
- I'll explain later.
The explanation isn't the issue.
Aah!
Oh, all right, all right.
Look, I-I swiped some beakers for the meth lab that I'm building in the trunk of my car.
But that's it.
I didn't kill any yam.
Tell it to the biology Professor.
Oh, now wait!
I know who did it.
I left the door open and someone came in.
He dropped your yam.
Will you tell our teacher who it was?
If you promise I won't get in trouble for stealing that meth lab stuff.
- Sure, whatever.
- Fine.
Pinky swear?
It was the guy with the weird head.
The army guy.
I heard the jar break and then I saw him running out of the room holding his hand.
Looked like he cut himself.
Well, well, well.
Look at this, Abed.
He weaves baskets and lies.
What's this about?
It's about the killing of our biology yam.
Will you please come with us?
But I'm in the middle of making a handle.
He wants it the hard way.
Tell him what Shirley said.
Todd Jacobson, you have the right to do whatever you want.
Nothing you say or do can be used against you by anyone, but we'd really like it if you came with us.
Please and thank you.
Make it quick, folks.
I have a class in five minutes and none of you guys are in it.
After conducting a full investigation, my study group now has definitive proof that Todd, with malice of forethought, smashed our yam.
That's a serious allegation.
I hope you can back it up.
We can place him in the building Monday night.
He has a mysterious bandage on his hand, and we have and eyewitness who saw Todd drop the jar and flee.
Well, Todd, what do you have to say?
- I just wanna - Don't answer that, soldier!
- This man is an American hero.
- And who are you?
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Archwood, United States Army.
I had the pleasure of commanding this young man in Iraq.
I'm staying on his couch this weekend while I'm in town for a wedding.
I am a licensed attorney, a veteran of two wars, and I'd like to know why in hell he's being harassed.
Mr. Winger, what is the intention here?
Simple.
When Todd smashed our yam, he stole an "A" from us.
We want it back.
You mean if he smashed the yam.
All you have is the word of this Mr. Star-Burns, who offers up no explanation as to why he was at the scene.
How about it, Jeffrey?
What was Star-Burns doing there?
We agreed to withhold that information as part of a pinky swear with the witness.
A pinky swear?
This is ludicrous.
This whole school is ludicrous.
Who honors the pinky swear of a degenerate over the word of a decorated soldier?
I'm inclined to agree with the man in uniform.
- Shocker.
- Jeffrey.
Tell us what Star-Burns was doing in that classroom, or your group can take an "F".
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
I grade my students.
Now, what Star-Face was doing there is irrelevant.
What matters is what he saw.
I'm upholding the pinky swear.
What?
Yo, man, you spent your life in the army.
I spent mine in prison.
Two places where a man's word is only as good as his uniform.
Now out here, it's supposed to be different.
And in my class, it will be.
You two can plead your case to the class and let them decide your grades.
Professor Thank you.
It's not a favor, Mr. Winger.
A man's gotta have a code.
Awesome.
See you in class.
- Uniform.
- Oh!
Jeez.
Yeah.
Shirley did some more digging.
Turns out Todd's yam never even sprouted.
Goes to motive.
And Star-Burns puts Todd in the classroom at 8:10.
Opportunity.
Add to that a cut on the hand and the Winger charm, we might get an A-plus-plus.
We still have a lot of work to do.
Oh, I think you've done enough.
Colonel Archwood got to Star-Burns.
Threatened to involve the real cops.
Now Star-Burns is in the wind.
He's our only witness.
That what you guys do in here?
You push your little papers and you make your little speeches, and in the end another dirtbag walks?
Huh?
Huh?
!
Abed!
Abed!
Abed!
Walk it off!
Walk it off!
I'm sorry about my partner.
He he's been on edge ever since we switched.
You.
Annie, that class already hates us.
If we go in there without a case, they'll fail us.
We have proof our yam was murdered and now you find your softness?
It's eat or be eaten when that's convenient, but when the going gets tough, Winger gets nervous, huh?
We have no case, Annie.
It's too late to get one, Jeff.
We only have time to get justice.
Tell us what happened next, Todd.
I disarmed the I.E.D. and returned the child to his mother.
She offered to give me her only possession a wooden chair but I refused.
I was only doing my duty and we had plenty of chairs at the base.
And for your valor, you were awarded a bronze star.
In fact, you have an absolutely glowing service record.
- Don't you, private?
- I do my best.
You do more than that, soldier.
Certainly more than this witness who supposedly saw you kill the yam.
A man who for all we know is a holocaust-denying, - Objection.
- Withdrawn.
One last question.
Did you intentionally break into the biology room with the express purpose of killing the study group's yam?
- No, sir, I did not.
- Thank you, soldier.
And God bless your testimony.
Your witness.
Tell me, Todd, do you consider yourself a hero?
Oh, no.
Of course not.
A hero doesn't call himself a hero.
A hero gets called a hero because of what he does.
And with your impressive record, not even I could deny you the title.
Objection, she's clearly ramping up to something.
Objection, that's not a real objection.
Objection, I hate the both of you.
You may proceed, Ms. Edison, but do so with caution.
Need I remind you this is not a courtroom?
I spent the majority of last night going over your records with Mr. Winger, scouring them for the slightest mistake, the tiniest slip up.
And I gotta tell you, Todd.
Couldn't find a thing.
Not one little smudge.
Except, of course, for one pesky yam that just wouldn't grow.
That had to weigh on your soul, didn't it, Todd?
- Maybe a little.
- A little?
A big orange splotch on your perfect record?
I bet that pissed you right off, didn't it?
Is that why you hit your wife?
Withdrawn.
Is that why you drink and pop pills?
Withdrawn.
Are you a virgin?
Withdrawn.
Did you kill our yam to settle the score, huh?
Did stomping on its roots make you feel like a big man?
No, it didn't.
I mean, I didn't Todd, zip it.
No, you zip it, Uncle Knobby.
I'm not fighting your wars anymore.
Listen to me, Todd.
I know how scary a failing grade can be, but this one dead yam won't tarnish your record.
What will tarnish it is lying to your class, to your teacher, and to me.
The American citizen you've sworn to protect.
Come on, Todd.
Stop disappointing me.
Defuse the I.E.D. of dishonesty.
It was an accident.
I just wanted to look at your yam, but when I picked up the jar, it burnt me and I dropped it.
Booyah!
That's how it's done!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah - Todd - Woo-hoo!
I'm telling your mother.
That's right.
Always have an exit strategy.
I think I've heard enough.
Professor Kane, may we have a sidebar in your office?
I want a mistrial.
Just give us a "C," give Todd a "C".
- Excuse me?
- What?
Can we take a sidebar in this sidebar?
Jeff, we're about to get our "A".
- Todd didn't do it.
- Um, he just confessed, dummy.
He said the jar burned him?
It doesn't make any sense.
People don't half-confess to crimes.
Look, when we started this, you were after the truth.
And then I convinced you it was more important to win.
Don't be like me.
A man's got to have a code.
I can only assume there is a female equivalent to that.
- A "codette" or something.
- But It's not worth getting an "A" if an innocent man might get an "F".
Okay, I heard all of that and I accept.
All right.
After speaking to the wronged parties, I've decided to Uh, if it pleases the bio class, I have closing arguments.
Of course you do.
Why was it so hard for all of us to grow a yam?
It's just a stupid yam in a stupid jar.
We're all fully-grown adults failing a kindergarten project.
- Can I object?
- I'll allow it.
Sustained.
And all this time we assumed our yam was targeted, that someone had stomped its roots maliciously.
But what if what if our yam's roots were dead before they hit the ground?
- Hey, that's mine!
- Look at it.
Everyone look.
Smushed without being stepped on.
Because it didn't have to be stepped on.
Because it was boiled.
Someone has been pouring boiling water into our jars at night.
No one noticed because the water cooled off by morning.
Boiling water is the icicle stabbing of yam killing.
Ooh, but that didn't Hmm.
This yam isn't boiled.
Vicki?
I don't I didn't do it, I swear!
I boiled the yams.
Vicki's yam never sprouted and I didn't want her to fail, so I threw off the grading curve so she wouldn't have to go to summer school and we can finally have sex in my parents' cabin.
God forgive me, I did it for love!
Holy crap.
We are definitely dissecting pine cones next year.
Neil has agreed to retake biology over the summer and his status as keymaster has been revoked.
After all the politics and procedure, in the end, the case really was about biology.
Told you it was an important subject.
Hello?
I understand.
Star-Burns got rear-ended and the meth lab in his trunk exploded.
He's dead.
- Abed?
- Yeah?
Why don't we have bunk bed conversations?
I don't know.
We're best friends, we share a bunk bed.
Seems like we should be having them all the time.
You start.
Okay.
Why do you think they call them "bunk beds"?
Where's the word "bunk" come from?
I don't know.
I think it comes from the word "bunker".
So when is your apartment done being fumigated?
Oh, it was done about a week ago.
Then why are you still here?
- I brought you some warm milk.
- Oh.
There you go.
Troy and Abed, off to Dreamland catching the train to Sleepytown and when they wake up the Dean'll be here staring at you Sweet deans.
That's nice I guess.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Okay.
Ahh.
Um, my name is Alex Osbourne, and if you're watching this, it means I'm dead.
Or I'm just showing you.
Uh, but I'm probably dead.
To my ex-wife Magda, I leave herpes.
But she knows that, it's dealt with.
As for my collection of Styx albums, I leave that to no one.
Because that's who appreciated Styx as much as me.
Finally, there's a kid named Abed who makes movies at my community college, and to him I leave the task of creating a video tribute of my life.
What follows is some general purpose footage that he can use.
Where did you get this?
Some one-armed guy with a scar on his face dropped it off.
He said he was Star-Burns' lawyer.
How one-armed was he?
Tell me when to stop.
- It was the other arm.
- You guys!
I feel oddly compelled to fulfill his request.
Would you guys help me write obituary copy?
You mean like, "Star-Burns died how he lived in a meth lab explosion"?
Can we turn this off?
I'm not as comfortable with death as you guys.
- He's in a better place now.
- Yeah.
The blu-ray shelf.
What is that?
Star-Burns also left me his ashes.
He requested they be burnt.
I don't think he knows how ashes work.
The small one's his lizard.
If we rub that, will he come out and do celebrity impressions?
- I don't think so.
- Then I want it out of here.
Give me some more time in a dream give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said we could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away You guys, how long are we going to avoid talking about this really serious thing that's happened?
Is it always about the Holocaust with you people?
I'm talking about Star-Burns, you know, dying.
I know it's sad, but death is a natural part of life and by the time I finish this sentence, died in China.
Why did you stop talking?
I have to call my pen pal.
Star-Burns was a good man.
He barely sued me that time I ran over his foot.
I say we honor Star-Burns by discussing him the same amount we did when he was alive.
Jeff, have some respect.
He might have been a scuzzy weirdo who shaved his sideburns into star shapes Pai Mai?
It's Troy.
Are you okay?
Okay, good, I gotta go.
This costs $7.
But he was also a classmate, a kinda sorta friend sometimes and above all, a human being.
He touched all our lives.
Annie has a point.
The death of a peer, especially at our age, can trigger a whole range of emotions.
- As a psychologist - Student.
- I hereby offer my licensed - Unlicensed.
Services as a grief counselor.
- Grief causer.
- If anyone needs to talk, - the doctor - Not even close.
Is in.
Britta, I could use some help dealing with my grief.
- Great.
- Yeah.
I was hoping you'd say that, because I came prepared.
You seemed smarter than me when I met you.
Thank you.
For the purposes of this exercise, I am Star-Burns.
Tell me the things you never got a chance to say to me.
Come on, guys, you can ask me anything.
What's heaven like?
Uh, I don't know.
Glittery.
- Ask me something else.
- Have you seen Tim Russert?
Guys, you are doing this wrong.
Ask me something personal.
Star-Burns, I didn't know you that well, but why did you smell exactly like salami?
- Abed.
- I got one.
Where's my comb?
- I don't know.
- Yep, it's him.
Why did you tape that switchblade to your ankle?
Why did you always poop with the stall door open?
Is it true you made out with Britta?
I don't see how that's relevant.
It was Fat Neil's black light party.
Vicki saw you.
If that's true if maybe it was because she was really drunk and she had just found out that her first boyfriend was getting married.
If you guys are gonna do this wrong, then I'm gonna take these off.
Ow!
Okay, grief counseling is growing on me.
Come on, I'm Dean and my hands are so clean at this moment I am stapling - Ben Chang is here.
- Ah, send him in.
- Ben, how's it "deaning"?
- Can't "com-Chang".
- Just needed you to sign this.
- Okay.
Let's just give this a little look-a-roo.
"Request for increased security".
"Cool new uniforms".
I like that.
"Power to enact martial law," not so much.
"Indefinite detention, pepper spray, involuntary cavity searches no soft-serve"?
All liquids and gels must be in sealed bottles no larger than 3 ounces.
I'm sorry, Chang, this stuff is too extreme.
This is a community college, not an inner-city High School.
It's a community college where a degenerate just blew himself up with stolen lab equipment.
To be fair, it was the crystal meth inside the stolen lab equipment that blew him up.
That's the problem with you civilian suits.
You want the results, but you don't want to know how the sausage gets made.
Well, I'll tell you how the sausage gets made.
It's a lot of ground meat and it gets stuffed into a casing that looks like a cross between a dude's dong and a poop.
I don't know how that helps me, but please leave.
Fine, but you will regret this.
I doubt it.
This just came for you.
Great.
I have to give more bad news to Jeff and his study group.
Hold my calls, I have to pick an outfit.
Who wants to dance?
Nice work, everyone.
Now think about that last little puppy in that basket out of all those puppies.
And now he's catching fire too.
Britta!
Why are you making us feel these things?
We need to bring our emotions to the surface and explore them.
Does it always have to be puppies though?
Oh, come on, everybody.
This is a completely unnecessary process.
What Jeff's doing right now is called denial and it is the first of five stages of grief that ends with acceptance.
- Name any other stage.
- What are you, my final?
Maybe we don't need grief counseling.
But seems like the least we could do is have a memorial or something.
Oh, yes, we could have a little service and I could bring some of my brownies and I guess someone should sing Ave Maria.
I mean, I can do it.
Whatever.
Sure, why not drag it out for weeks?
Why not wallow for the rest of our lives and never get anything done?
Or we could just admit the simple fact that one day, something is in your life and one day, it's not.
Dean-jour, mes amis!
Unfortunately, due to the whole Star-Burns meth lab explosion, Professor Kane has resigned, and you biology class has been can-can-cancelled.
Your grade is now an incomplete.
You'll have to make up the credit in the summer.
My summer is gone?
No.
No!
Well, I had a little rockette kick-line thing planned, but Ave Mariii iaaa Okay.
That was Garrett singing, um, Ave Maria?
Ave Maria!
Uh, now, Shirley, I understand you wanted - to sing something as well?
- No, thank you.
Okay, then let's move on to the eulogies.
Does anyone have anything they wanna say in the memory of Star-Burns?
Oh Because his sideburns were shaped like stars.
I just got it.
I just got that.
Anything at all.
This is a safe place to say - what you're feeling.
- I'll say something.
Oh, oh.
After learning about Star-Burns' death, I personally went through the stages of grief and have now arrived at the final one acceptance.
Whoo!
Closure!
Acceptance that this place This fallujah of higher learning is a prison from which none of us will ever escape.
Okay, Jeffrey, now we're mixing metaphors here And it turns out that Star-Burns, this man in this urn, was a hero to us the whole time because he did the one thing that none of us ever tried to do.
He got out.
And then he exploded.
Because Greendale hates its students.
No.
No.
It sucks the lives from their bodies and forces their desiccated husks to attend summer school.
Okay, Jeffrey, this is a funeral.
Let's keep it light.
Annie, Annie, maybe you could say something nice about Star-Burns.
Get some sugar to go with that spice.
Way to go, Jeff.
Star-Burns or Alex, as he like to be called, was a human being.
A Greendale human being Like me.
I've given this place my childhood, my enthusiasm, and my loyalty, and in return, Greendale has warped me like a Barbie in a microwave.
Our school flag is an anus!
You were the guys who drew it.
We're not even the best community college in our community.
Let that sink in.
And the cherry on top on this total lack of sundae I'm failing a remedial biology class on a technicality all because you don't know how to run a school.
- Oh, that's - Shame on you, Dean.
Shame on you!
Edison out.
Wow.
Let's maybe not drop the $50 mics, okay, guys?
Shirley, you love Jesus.
I think we all could use some good old-fashioned religion right now.
Well, uh, all right.
Um, Star-Burns, I'm told, um, was a drug dealer.
Which, of course, is not good behavior.
Which but he it was a business.
Um, he had an entrepreneurial spirit.
Amen.
I had an entrepreneurial spirit.
I had dreams.
Dreams of opening a sandwich shop in this cafeteria.
And Greendale listened to those dreams And stole them And sold them to Subway.
Worst wake ever.
I'm starting to get nervous about this.
Yep, it'd be nice to have some protection, right?
Think maybe it's about time you signed this?
Just promise me you'll use restraint.
Yep.
Every type we got.
- Gentlemen!
- All hail Chang!
This is the day we've been waiting for.
Suit up!
When I say Greendale, you say sucks - * Greendale * - * Sucks * - * Greendale * - * Sucks * - Peace.
- Boo boo boo.
No, no, no, no, no, no, oh, no, you don't.
Look, I don't know how this got out of hand either.
But as a student who's been at Greendale for over a decade, I think I've earned the right to say a few final words.
Let him talk!
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you, thank you.
Let's burn this mother down!
Yeah!
Helter skelter!
No, no, no!
I'm gonna take everything but onions and olives.
I know my comb's in here, you son of a bitch!
Look, tiny riot gear.
Aww.
It's so peppery!
Oh, no.
Strange, I'm not finding any pepper spray on you.
Well, check harder.
It's not like I'm crying because I was chased by the gang of scary 12-year-olds.
No entry, we're guarding General Chang's prisoners.
Okay, this is my school, and I will enter whatever I want.
Well, Subway has threatened to pull out of Greendale and the school board is furious.
Tomorrow, they are having a hearing to investigate the ringleaders of the riot, aka the Greendale Seven.
Catchy.
How about Pierce Hawthorne and the Greendale Six?
- Pierce!
- How about the Greendale Five?
- I'm such a bad Dean.
- No, you're not.
Well, you are.
But We're worse students.
While you tried to save Greendale, we trashed the school like a TV commercial where the teacher banned skittles.
That's sweet of you to say, Jeffrey.
But it doesn't change the fact that we're all Ted Danson at Whoopie Goldberg's roast.
What if we all back each other up to the board and explain the we were all experiencing "funeral crazies"?
I can say that's a thing because I'm a psych major.
Ugh, they're still going to need a fall guy.
How about the crazy man who commanded a bunch of preteens to spray poison in our faces?
You know what?
It was right under our noses, wasn't it?
Group hug Where I'm between Jeff and Troy.
Here we go oop, you're walking away from the hug.
Hey there, Ben.
Would you mind scooching from my desk?
Got some testimony to get prepared for the school board meeting tomorrowsies.
That testimony wouldn't happen to involve pinning the riot on me.
Ben, I'm sorry, but this has gone too far.
I regret issuing those extraordinary powers to you.
I regret letting this child army get out of hand.
I regret giving you that unasked for adult back rub when you were asleep that once.
I think we're gonna have to let you go.
Nuh-uh, ain't happening.
I always knew this day would come.
Now the only person getting replaced around here is you.
Oh, my God, it's me.
Ugh!
I will The single worst wake riot this district has ever seen.
And we've seen our share.
Tables, chairs, floors, ceilings, all affected.
A campus already in mourning is pushed into chaos.
And sitting here facing me now, the so-called Greendale Seven Reportedly responsible for inciting the entire chain of events.
This is some pretty serious stuff.
Sir Although my friends and I behaved somewhat irresponsibly, we shouldn't forget about the circumstances on campus.
We had just lost a classmate.
And a lizard Your Majesty.
It was an emotional time and we acted emotionally.
But the real question is, how did the school respond?
The riot was exacerbated by the school security staff's heavy-handed and, frankly, insane response.
Hey, everyone.
Oh, so sorry to pop in like this.
I really hope I'm not interrupting.
Just wanted to see how everything's going, and those are for you fellas.
I never forget a face or a favorite cookie.
And I brought extras, because I know how Richie got into that last basket I brought.
Probably good to have a backup.
I did.
I did get into them pretty good.
So everything going okay?
Or are you guys going to trash this building too?
Yeah, we were just going over the charges.
Seems like you had your hands full with these individuals.
This is crazy.
- You guys are really buying this?
- Excuse me?
Chang is a psychopathic wannabe warlord with an army of prepubescent thugs.
He was living in the school's air vent system with a monkey!
That's not Well, where's the Dean?
He'll tell you.
Hey, guys.
Can't stay, gotta run, but, uh, these troublemakers have got to go.
I think I've heard enough, and I don't see what choice I have.
Greendale Seven Jeff Winger, Annie Edison, Pierce Hawthorne, Britta Perry, Shirley Bennet, Abed Nadir, Troy Barnes, you are hereby expelled from Greendale Community College.
May God have mercy on your souls.
Rusty bucket?
Rusty bucket?
- Rusty bucket?
- Yep.
Okay, transform and roll out.
down the drain.
I was gonna be the first one in my family to graduate from community college.
Everyone else graduated from normal college.
Now they're really gonna give me a hard time.
You're drinking?
Yeah, well, my life can't get double ruined.
Can't believe we're expelled.
Greendale was our home.
Britta, isn't it time for you to explain that every failure is also an opportunity?
- Whatever, I'm the worst.
- I'm also the worst.
Not gonna argue, but I am gonna forgive you.
That's the pizza.
Roll a die to see who gets it?
I'll get it.
You guys remember our housewarming party?
What would have happened if I had just let Jeff roll the die that night?
I assumed this was the best timeline, but what if it's the darkest?
Well, I don't think anyone knows what you're talking about, but it does seem like things couldn't get any worse.
No.
We're all gonna get through this.
We're all alive and we're all fine.
And Britta, you're not the worst.
You're the best.
He's right.
Things are bad.
But we're together.
That makes this the perfect timeline.
Wait.
There are other timelines?
Pizza time.
you never see the dawn when you have blood in your eyes the night will fight with steel until it brings you down Star-Burns burn the night sky alive Star-Burns burn for his country and honor he will never die
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Look at us.
Still together as a group even, what, two months after being kicked out of you know where.
Yeah, good thing I came up with this idea for potluck dinners.
Pierce, all you said was, "I'm hungry".
All Henry Ford said was, "I need a ride".
Troy, is that a casserole?
It's bagel bites in a deconstructed hot pocket reduction with a doritos glaze.
I just really want to make my food, you know.
Did anybody bring anything that isn't poison?
I need to eat natural, organic foods, or I'm never gonna get rid of this hangover.
Jeff, what'd you bring?
Pack of lifesavers.
Sorry.
Dead battery.
Where's Abed?
Have you seen Abed?
He's probably out getting something really cool for the dinner.
See?
Cool.
Abed brought delicious police.
Abed, what happened?
Found your friend going through the dumpster outside the administration building in Greendale again.
This cadet could use a lesson in intergalactic protocol.
It's okay, officer.
He's just playing a character from TV.
Oh, yes, I'm very familiar with Inspector Spacetime.
You think a guy becomes a cop because his prom night was a dream?
If this were comic-con, I'd take a bullet for that kid.
But, here in the real world, trespassing is a crime.
We're sorry, officer.
Our friend has been having a hard time adjusting to being expelled from Greendale.
It won't happen again.
That's for sure.
I talked to your former Dean.
I recommended he press charges.
He said he'd hold off on the condition that you set an appointment with this guy.
He's offering to foot the bill for the consultation himself.
It's the number for a psychiatrist.
What?
No.
Abed's not crazy.
Where does the Dean get off?
He's not the real Dean.
He's been replaced by an identical life-form for some nefarious purpose.
Reggie, to the time booth.
We haven't much space.
I'll be right there, inspector.
Hey, before I go, you really shouldn't be using this to prop open your building's door.
This is an antique fire brick.
I'd say pre-civil war.
Note the uneven orange hue and the embossment on the back.
What a nifty little piece of americana.
You could get 50, 60 bucks for it from the right collector.
I watch a lot of antiques roadshow.
Oh.
Anyway, walk to your cars in pairs tonight.
Rape's up 8%.
$60?
Hello?
Rich people, Troy's joining you.
Yes, I'll hold.
Give me some more tie me to dream give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said it can be here we could be roped up tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one, they all just fade away Abed.
I'm Dr. Heidi.
We're going to have a little chat tonight, you and I. How does that sound?
I don't need therapy.
Well, that's a perfectly normal response.
I concur with Dr. Heidi's diagnosis.
I haven't diagnosed anything yet.
Psych major.
Got your back, brah.
I have to say, I didn't expect to see so many of you.
Abed won't go to any kind of doctor on his own.
We caught him last year trying to remove his own tonsils.
Well, why don't you let me take it from here?
You have to understand about Abed.
He's usually, you know, adorable weird, like mork from ork, but, since we got expelled, he's been creepy weird, like present-day Robin Williams.
- I'm not crazy.
- Well, Abed, I don't deal in crazy.
I deal in health.
Hmm.
So how long has Abed needed a crazy amount of help?
All of this behavior started after you were expelled?
There may have been a ramp-up.
It's okay, buddy.
Just a few more minutes, and we're good until spring, okay?
But it doesn't make any sense.
Think of it this way.
We get the hour back later in the year.
Yeah.
I "Rent Tower Heist" last night, and I won't spoil the ending, but let me tell you, it was quite the hilarious Thrill Ride.
That Brett Ratner, he's a master at comedic action-adventure.
Mm.
A master at storytelling.
He's just a master at making movies in general.
I'm gonna say it.
He's the new Spielberg.
Oh!
I have to go.
Excuse me.
Okay.
You're a bad person.
You're a bad person.
Time enough at last to eat a sandwich.
Though even he knew that this sandwich was nearer his last sandwich than his first.
Abed, I'm trying to eat.
He said, oldly, his brittle bones straining to support the weight of his wrinkly skin.
Stop narrating me.
He shouted to no one, just a man alone in time with nothing but the cold squishiness of tuna salad to comfort him.
I take it back.
I don't want to be in your novel.
Pierce Hawthorne had nearly lost his grip on reality.
Lately, he'd begun to think he was in a novel.
And action.
Abed, what the hell are you doing?
Cut.
We got it.
One more for safety.
Abed, it's 4:30 in the morning, and you're in my bedroom.
Use that.
Okay.
And action.
But that's almost completely nearly all of it.
If Abed is as sick as you all say, then I have no Wait a minute.
Nobody in this room gets to define sick.
I do.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Any kind of doctor can really.
- Really?
- Yes.
Well, if Abed's sick, then we're all sick.
Yeah.
You can't determine a person's sanity from a few amusing stories.
- Exactly.
- That's right.
I mean, if anything, Abed's more sane than any of us.
Yeah.
Well.
I mean, he's certainly the craziest one of us, but, you know, we're all kind of crazy-town banana pants.
Talk to me about crazy-town banana pants.
Look, we're just saying it's been a crazy year for everybody.
Who among us hasn't had the odd banana in his or her pants, right?
I have.
How long does peyote last?
Just asking for a friend.
Troy and Abed and Annie in the morning What are you doing?
Nothing.
Nothing my ass.
What are all these cameras doing here?
Here, take my coat.
Oh.
Thank you.
That's so sweet.
Just don't eat anything or drink anything, and no sweating or bending at the elbows, and no chairs with backrests, and if you take it off, wooden hangers only.
You're probably warm now, right?
Good news, guys.
I spent all my money.
Troy, you can't bring that in here.
Yes, I can.
It's all-terrain, dummy.
I made a plate of cookies for the study group, but my boys ate them, so since they took something of yours, you all get something of theirs.
Elijah loves this, Britta.
There you go, Jeff.
There you go, Troy.
There you go, Pierce.
Karate championship, second place!
Now I'll be unstoppable.
Oyay!
So you see what you call insanity we call solidarity.
I'm sorry.
We just finished telling him about it, and you grab it and squeeze it?
- I said I was sorry.
- Uh-huh.
And so as a group, do you always indulge Abed in these little misadventures?
Take that back.
Our adventures are very manly.
I have to say there's more important to mental health than a support system.
And assuming that this group is, for Abed, said support system, I think I've heard everything I need to hear in order to make a decision.
I think that Abed should be committed.
You mean committed to his character work, right?
Because he already is.
Abed, show him your Don Draper.
Cigarettes.
No, I mean an institution.
You mean like marriage?
I mean a mental institution.
Ah.
So do I. Will someone please help me lighten the mood?
Please, Mr. Dr. psychiatrist, sir, please don't send my best friend to crazy people jail.
Relax.
He doesn't have the right.
Abed's not dangerous.
Yeah, he's just unique, like a snowflake who gets bent out of shape when you mix up Star Wars and space treks.
Or a serial killer's signature.
I'm a psych major.
His continued obsession with Greendale Community College suggests the potential for escalation.
And, frankly, these stories you've been telling me are very troubling.
You're troubled?
I don't remember any of those things happening.
Since when do these three live together?
Look, Abed's obsession with Greendale doesn't make him crazy.
If you had gone to school there, you'd be obsessed with it too.
It was a messed-up place.
We had lockers.
Yeah.
We're survivors.
My name is Pwofussa Wobinswin.
Who's weady to wearn?
Dean, this is not the way to agree on parking for the job fair!
It's inhumane.
You have a better idea, Britta?
Yes.
Thousands of them.
Vicki to Queen 3.
Neigh.
That's all for today.
Read chapter four.
Okay, we're just gonna ignore that.
- Bananas?
- Yes.
- Toast?
- Yes.
- Bubble gum?
- Yes.
- Pancakes?
- Yes.
- Fries?
- Get out.
Get out.
There's one every year.
I will not tolerate clowning.
- Car keys?
- Yes.
Okay, last bathroom break.
We've got to cram for Excuse me, sir, can we get to our Slow your bones, Rufus.
We got a long road tomorrow.
Welcome to ladders.
Interesting.
Eh.
Just wanted to see if we got the same thing.
It sounds as though this Greendale had quite an effect on all of you.
You should all definitely stop dwelling on it if you want to be healthy.
Well, come on, it wasn't all bad.
I was there longer than anybody, and I'm fine.
How are you?
Why do you ask?
Uh-oh.
What Pierce was saying before he started sundowning is true.
We can't just pass the crazy buck to Greendale.
It could be a good place too.
That really doesn't matter.
Yeah, we have a lot of memories of Greendale being in our corner.
Dean-a-ling.
I just wanted to drop by and tell you we ought to be hot-stepping it out to the parking lot in a brisk, but orderly fashion.
Is there a fire drill?
No, sir, there's an actual fire.
I wanted you guys to be the first to know before I tell everyone else.
I know.
It's not right to play favorites, but it is no more right to sit on your feelings, and I don't know what I'd do without you guys.
Whoa.
Okay, fire, fire!
There's a fire!
Darcy, you've got a cold.
- I feel fine.
- You're sick.
Go home!
Get out of here.
Get out of here.
Get out of here.
Get out of here!
I can't believe we got here too late for pizza.
Worst pizza day ever.
Oh, darn it.
What am I gonna do with all this garbage?
Psst, it's me, the Dean.
I pulled the last six pieces of pizza for you.
Ohh.
Back to garbage detail.
We have a few students with birthdays today, but, hey, why single them out?
What about the students who aren't celebrating anything at all?
Are they any less special?
Troy and Jeffrey and Annie and Britta and Shirley and Pierce and Abed and Jeffrey just a few of the most special students in the world Damn it.
Out of slugs.
Next time, I'll put you square, you pickle-sucking MacGillycuddy.
Why did you save me, Dean?
I know how important paintball is to you, Abed.
I wanted you to win.
It's not important anymore.
I get it now.
It just feels forced.
You just enjoy your prize Free tickets to to see 'Chicago" at the Greendale Civic Center with George Wendt and Stefanie Powers.
Lame!
Okay.
That was great, but you really didn't need to go into it.
You know what occurs to me?
What all those great Greendale memories have in common?
I was barely in them?
They were all about Dean Pelton.
That's what I've been trying to make you guys understand for the last two months.
I keep telling you, we weren't expelled by the real Dean.
It couldn't have been him.
He loved us.
Maybe we've been so concerned with moving past Greendale, we've been living in denial.
It's true.
I mean, let's face it.
We weren't driven crazy by Greendale.
And Abed's not the crazy one for obsessing about it.
Abed, we're sorry.
We haven't been supporting you, and we haven't been honest with ourselves.
Dr. Heidi, something weird is going on with that school.
Abed doesn't need to be here.
We need to be there.
But there is no there.
That's the problem.
That's why we have to go back.
No, you can't go back to Greendale.
Why?
Because it isn't healthy?
'Cause it doesn't exist.
I parked by a meter.
Any of y'all park by a meter?
Wait, what?
What you mean, Greendale doesn't exist?
Well, there is a place called Greendale, and you all spent three years there, but it was not a community college.
These memories that you people have been sharing are a shared psychosis.
You were patients there together, you were released together, and I am alarmed to see that you are now relapsing together.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is not real.
You're lying.
Search your mind for the real memories.
Try to look past the trauma you've been blocking out.
- What trauma?
- You all came to this community college after your lives had fractured.
Pill addiction, failed legal career, broken marriage, lost scholarship, - old.
- Enough!
I don't want to hear mine.
And, if we were going to fabricate a delusion, why would we fabricate a community college?
Ah, yes, this fantastical community college where everything that happens is unbelievably ridiculous and it all revolves around you as a group.
The same reason anyone plunges into psychosis, miss Perry.
It was a mentally-compatible alternative to your grim reality.
Can you believe the secret trampoline we found?
I know.
It's so great.
For Greendale!
Charge!
Come on, Leonard.
- Yow!
- Ooh!
baby boomer Santa thank you for everything you're welcome, you're welcome for everything in the world - Terry, stop it.
- * You're welcome, hey * - Let's do a clip show.
- Bottle episode.
- Don't forget the clip show.
- Harrison Ford.
Remember when we went camping?
Yes.
Remember when we painted the nursery?
Yes.
Remember when we remembered going camping while we were in the nursery?
I'm a millionaire, I'm an inventor, I'm a legend, and I had sex with Eartha Kitt.
It's sad.
Should we increase their lithium?
Not yet.
I want to see what happens if we confiscate one of their pens.
- It's not possible.
- Mm.
You say you started as a Spanish study group.
Do any of you speak Spanish?
Mi hambre es bombero tirantes.
And you've attended Greendale for three years, but don't community colleges end after two?
Everyone's always saying that.
The average community college student attends school five to seven years.
Many offer four-year degrees.
In your mind, they do.
In your mind.
And you shared this delusion with each other, like that time all those people got into swing dance music back in the '90s.
And then you were released, probably because your insurance ran out.
But the official story is that you're now fit to live within society again.
You just have to accept the truth.
Wait.
Give me a break.
That made no sense.
Yeah, it's me.
No, I think they bought it.
I had to do a little riffing at the end, but I was pretty convincing.
Well, if it looks like I'm sneaking out the window, it's just a symptom of your deepening psychosis.
Don't hurt me.
Greendale doesn't exist?
How long did you think we'd buy that?
I'm literally carrying a Greendale backpack.
I have, like, 1,000 pictures of the campus on my phone.
I have children I see every day.
I have definitely not been locked up.
Get him.
Why would you lie to make us think we were crazy?
Because, Ms. Edison, Greendale is purgatory, and I am the devil.
- What?
- I knew it.
Stop letting him make you realize stuff.
These aren't even good lies.
All right, fine, I had to come up with something.
You were getting too close.
Close to what?
To the truth.
The Indian kid was right.
- He's Arabic.
- Also Polish.
Whatever.
I'm a fake psychiatrist, not a fake ethnologist.
The point is your Dean was kidnapped by Ben Chang and replaced with a double.
I was hired to keep you off the scent.
Chang kidnapped the Dean?
Even for him, that's insane.
Is it?
Think about it.
Whoo!
I said hot damn!
Chang What are you doing?
I'm predicting future crimes.
Now I'm sick.
See, you said that would happen.
You are a pre-cog!
Again.
You're weak.
Uh, guys, while we were remembering Chang is crazy, the fake doctor sneaked away.
- Oh, crap!
- What?
There goes our only chance of clearing our names.
You guys, forget about us.
The Dean has been kidnapped.
He's out there somewhere, alone and cold and most likely trying to cobble together a sexy Patty Hearst costume.
Britta's right.
Wait, what?
We need to rescue the Dean.
We need to get back to that school.
And we definitely never need to do another paintball.
- Yeah.
- See, therapy does work.
We're cured.
Aw.
Aw.
Sounds like the study group has gotten wise to Operation Doppel-Deaner.
It's time for phase two.
What's phase two?
Hey, I'm making up the same plan you are.
Pitches, pitches, pitches.
Ah, thank you, Megan.
Troy and Abed in the morning Nights.
Welcome back, all you night owls.
Troy, why don't we open up the phone lines?
Talk to us, lonely hearts.
We got Jeff W. calling.
Hello?
Hey, Jeff, what's your question?
- Who is this?
- Great question.
We're us.
You guys, it's 3:00 in the morning.
I'm trying to sleep.
I'm sorry to hear that, Jeff.
Why don't you stay on the line and we'll get your information.
Yeah, we'll get you the help you need.
Our next caller's Annie E. What's on your mind tonight, Annie?
Hey, guys, long time, first time, love the show.
Aw, appreciate ya.
How can we help?
You can shut up and go to sleep.
Well, Jacks and Jills, that's about all the time we have tonight.
Yeah, until next time, may your dreams be sweet and your nightmares be "spooky monster" scary and not "grandma died" scary.
Troy and Abed in the morning Nights.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Pierce, you made us all drive out to a warehouse in the middle of nowhere.
You could at least tell us why.
Hey, I know as much as you.
I got a letter from the executor of my father's estate.
It said to come out here with my seven closest friends.
You brought six.
Well, who else was he gonna bring?
Levar Burton was a maybe.
Mr. Hawthorne.
I apologize.
- Gilbert.
Even from the grave, my father's got you by the short and curly salt and pepperies.
My name is Gilbert Lawson.
I was Cornelius Hawthorne's assistant for over 30 years, and before that, I was just the teenager who read the Bible to him in the bath.
- ew.
- All right, all right.
It's inheritance time.
How 'bout that check, soul brother?
Your father did leave you something, but it's more of an activity.
Thank you for keeping it as creepy as possible.
This looks like a multi-Player gaming interface.
I've heard enough.
Oh, that diabolical old fossil face.
I asked him for money to invest in video games back in 1979.
Cornelius spent over 30 years developing a video game for you.
It was his dying wish that you and seven of your closest friends would play it.
Lavar Burton was a maybe.
So, please, choose a seat.
Cool.
So a 100-year-Old man designed a 30-year-Old video game?
This I've got to see.
once you're seated behind your computers, a photograph of you will be taken and an avatar will be made from your likeness.
I didn't bring my likeness.
Don't smile.
All right, everyone, let's begin.
?
T× ?
T× - Nice!
- Cool.
- Old school.
- Cool, cool, cool.
Which one is me?
I assume nothing because I'm not racist.
aww!
We're adorable!
Why did this thing take photos if it was going to completely fabricate random body shapes?
That's what I'm saying!
My hair looks good, though.
Orange button is jump.
Whee!
Which guy am I?
There's a door here.
- Peace.
Love.
- What's that?
- I think it's a hippie.
- Peace.
Love.
aww!
Annie, stop "Awing" everything.
don't be jaded.
He's saying "Peace".
Hello.
- Sex.
- Did he say "Sex"?
- Drugs.
Sex.
Oh, my god.
hold on, I'm coming.
- oh!
Oh!
Ow!
Ow!
- Darn!
Shoot!
Dang it.
Um-- - Jeff, you just murdered Annie.
Well, better than doing nothing!
- I'm not sure that's the case.
- that's debatable.
You guys, help me.
- the way you helped Annie?
- Sex.
Before we engage, we should hang back and study their tactics.
- What?
- Group sex.
Oh, my god!
Oh, cool, I'm alive.
Pierce?
- This game makes no sense.
What happened to you?
I don't want to talk about it.
Pierce, point the joystick right.
So I'm supposed to just guess that?
Where are the instructions?
Take that!
Take that!
Yeah, we rule!
Oh, you guys are alive.
You re-Spawn in the study room when you die.
Here, I'll show you.
- Hey!
- Jeffrey!
Shame on you!
"hang back and study their tactics"?
Let him get it out of his system.
Ah, forget it.
Let's just keep moving.
Now what?
Welcome to hawkthorne.
that's dad's voice.
Dad?
Piercinald, in 1980, you said that video games, not moist towelettes, were the business of the future.
Today, moist towelettes are stocked in every supermarket, while arcade after arcade closes.
He's got a point.
nevertheless, I designed this game to be played upon my death by you and whatever cabal of fruits, junkies, and sluts you call your friends.
Her name is Britta.
Only one player can win-- The first to reach my throne Inside castle hawkthorne.
Their reward, Pierce, will be your inheritance.
- What?
- His inheritance?
What?
So you see, Pierce, turns out you were right.
Video games are important.
Worst son ever!
Well, great.
How do I fight you guys?
Which button fights?
- Pierce, stop.
- Pierce, relax.
Pierce, stay in the game, stay in the game.
Pierce, calm down.
Nobody's gonna fight you.
Why not?
Because when you're friends with someone for three years, it's weird to steal their family's money.
And there wouldn't be a lot of sport in beating you.
Look at yourself.
Yeah, he's right.
You're playing the game wrong.
It's Gilbert.
You're not supposed to cooperate, you're supposed to compete.
Thanks for the advice, but I think we can choose how we want to play.
- I suppose we can.
- is he being ominous?
Why are you being ominous?
Whoa.
We can pick stuff up?
This game is more complex than you can imagine.
And aside from its programmers, who have all been deported back to China, I'm the one who knows how it works.
Run, run!
He's gonna throw a knife!
He's gonna throw a knife!
Go!
Jump!
Jump!
Wah!
Wait!
What are you--?
he's a psychopath!
He's suffo-- Yeah.
Hey, look, Buddy, I know it must have sucked being colonel Sanders' manservant and all, but Pierce is technically our friend, and we're not gonna watch you screw him over.
Perhaps you should be asking yourselves how you intend to stop me.
How about if we come over there and kick your ass?
Go get him, Troy.
Be my guest.
But 30 seconds after you leave your chairs, the weight sensors will recognize it as an automatic forfeit.
Weight sensors?
That's it.
Let's get that jag!
- Yeah!
- Get him!
- Kick that hippie's ass!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let's go!
Move, move, move!
- I think he left a note.
- What?
"after you've squandered the last of your savings, "I'll watch you writhe, penniless, in the gutter, "through a telescope in the penthouse office of Hawthorne tower".
you can leave notes.
This game is incredible.
Pierce?
- No, Pierce!
- Please, no!
We need you!
Just let me die.
Pierce, so Gilbert knows a couple tricks.
Big deal.
We outnumber him.
And most importantly, while he's fighting for greed, we're fighting for friendship, which means we can't lose, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay!
I guess there's no hug button.
Everybody keep Pierce protected.
We have to get him to the throne of hawkthorne before Gilbert.
And don't forget, when you die, you go all the way back to the study room.
Sodon't die.
Good pep talk, Jeff.
Yeah, I used to love dying, but that speech really turned me around.
Whatever.
What's that?
Kill it!
It's a girl milking a cow, Pierce.
I'll check it out.
I owe Jeff that.
I wasn't gonna say it.
I am Hilda.
I live in the village.
- Lesbian.
- Shh!
I can help with that.
I have information on many topics.
Cool.
The throne is in castle hawkthorne, north of here.
You unlock the castle with the white crystal of discipline, which you must free from the black caverns.
I'm picking up on some hidden symbolism.
right, "White Crystal".
You think dad was into meth?
You can usually get supplies in a town like this.
Man, why can't my mom be here?
She always said my video game Knowledge would come in handy.
I never believed her.
Everybody split up and take a hut.
Our only chance of beating Gilbert is to cover more ground.
I have information on the following topics.
Holy crap.
Where have you been my whole life?
I buy and sell weapons and armor.
Cool.
We need weapons.
ooh.
Well, what's free?
Can we have a torch?
- Thief!
Thief!
- Annie, put it back.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Arr!
Arr!
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Oh, my god.
- Oh, oh!
Oh, no!
What are you doing?
- It was an accident!
- Arrr!
- He's dying!
- Arrrrrr!
- All right, hold on, hold on!
Arrr!
Arrr!
Now what are you doing?
He was suffering!
Yeah, from axe wounds!
Well, if this isn't worth any points, what is?
You're asking me?
I'm still looking for a pong paddle.
- Let's play poker.
- Oh, now we're talking.
Check the desk.
I'll check the dresser.
How do I straighten that painting?
You can't.
Stop playing like a girl.
Stop playing like a girl?
Here's the thing about women, Jeff.
We don't Hack and slash our way through life because we're one with life.
- Help me hide the body.
- Oh, my lord.
Oh, my lord.
Shirley, these things happen in video games.
- They do?
- Yes.
We can't get hung up on Real world morality.
We need to survive and win.
Hello, I'm the blacksmith's wife--Aah!
Help!
- Oh, crap!
- Guard the door.
What?
Shirley!
No witnesses!
Grab everything you can carry.
I'll check upstairs for any more family.
Don't give me that look.
These are your loose ends.
I'm just tying 'em up.
This is so cool.
Where are your clothes?
Pierce taught me poker.
I'm not good at it.
You still talking to this girl?
Yeah, she only has three moves that you activate with basic patterns of stimulus.
I've never felt this way before.
- Abed, don't get weird.
- Oh, I won't.
She's not ready for anything serious, but she wants me to meet her family.
- My father is the blacksmith.
- her father's a blacksmith.
- Hello!
- Everybody go shopping?
That's all we did.
Is that hut on fire?
Oh, my.
What an unexplained tragedy.
don't we look comfy at a cauldron.
check it out.
Ooh, see, I'll put all of this in here, and then that, and then I'll hit this.
What is it?
I assume, like, a strength potion.
Then I assume it's poison.
You're just jealous because we found a world where I know what I'm doing.
This place is 20 cat turds and a pixies poster from being your apartment.
What's with the st.
Pauli girl?
Hilda's parents lived there.
Now she has no family.
She'll be forced to marry a male villager or take her chances in the wilderness.
What kind of game is this?
Oh, crap, it's Gilbert.
Well, well, well.
Looks like someone's one step behind.
Yeah, if you're looking for equipment, tough luck.
The store was lost in a freak accident.
I hardly need equipment, young lady.
While you were shopping, I gained enough levels to do this.
Uh-Huh, come on and bring it!
He's shooting lightning and I'm naked!
Get behind us!
We have armor!
Oh!
Whoa!
Aah!
Oh, great!
Gilbert!
Oh, great!
Evil Jedi lightning Gilbert!
oh!
Britta, drink that super strength potion you made.
Oh, right, right, right, right.
Hurry up, Britta!
I'm trying, I'm trying!
Aah!
Damn it, I thought we could count on Britta to not screw up drinking.
This'll be fun.
what the hell?
Here's hoping we can count on her to screw up making potions.
Unbelievable.
Jeff bet all our lives on Britta and won, and I lost my pants to a pair of nines.
very well.
Let's play.
Abed, are you sure about this?
Yeah.
It just feels like the right thing to do.
Hey, I made it back.
You guys never died.
How did you beat Gilbert?
Oh, you know.
Teamwork.
We were headed for the black caves to find the white crystal.
We were just saying good-Bye to abed.
I'm gonna stay here in the village with Hilda and help her rebuild her life.
Abed, she's a program.
People have said similar things about me.
Uh-Oh.
He's playing the rain man card.
Let's bounce.
I've got an inheritance to win.
?
T× ?
T× Offensive.
Called it.
Shut up, Britta.
?
T× ?
T× You did great in there, Jeff.
Shut up, Pierce.
?
T× ?
T× Okay, duck.
Stay ducked.
Okay, unduck.
Okay, now jump.
I think we're almost there.
Thank god.
This cave is the worst.
I know, I don't know what's more offensive-- The actual racism or the insulting notion that it might somehow rub off on us.
look out!
Jive turkeys!
Kill them before they start multiplying!
- Yeah, suck on this!
- Take that, jive turkey!
All right!
The White crystal!
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
- Get it!
- Get it!
I'll take it.
I've earned it by having friends.
This is it.
It certainly is.
- No, man!
- You again?
Now I'll have that crystal.
I think you'll have this.
whoops.
Arrows!
What?
Come on!
Where'd you get all that stuff?
You've only been alive for an hour.
Well, that was not fair.
What the hell, Gilbert?
You're cheating, which I have no problem with, but you're getting caught, and that's not cool!
Yeah, don't be a knob.
That inheritance is rightfully mine!
Rightfully?
I'm his son.
- So am I. - Oh.
What?
That can't be True.
You're halfwhite.
- Nice save.
Do you remember your childhood nanny, Etta?
Well, Etta had a hot cousin.
My mother.
So you see, Pierce, I am your half-Brother, and I am more your father's son than you ever were, so shut up and play the game.
Why you-- - Let's go, Pierce.
Okay, look, I know things seem hopeless because he's all the way to the castle with the crystal and we're starting over, but here's the thing-- We're better at this game now.
We've died and been reborn, and that makes us heroes.
- Charge!
- Let's get him!
?
T× ?
T× I guess the fact that we're still playing means he hasn't won yet.
Yeah, but what's the point?
He'll just keep cheating until he wins.
Why are all the trees cut down?
Isn't this where abed's village was?
- Hello, old friends.
- abed!
You remember Hilda.
I live in the village.
I love abed.
Did she just say your name?
Yeah, if you Max out a character's trust and affection levels, you can gain access to a front-End scripting language.
Watch.
Cool cool cool!
She can make babies for me.
Oh, and I can't?
I can't.
Come on inside.
I built this from scratch.
Check out my castle.
- Oh, it's nice.
- Wow.
I hope this isn't blood gold.
This is my family.
Baby abed has my eyes and her bonnet.
Each baby is capable of executing custom code, which means you can write a code that makes one baby tell another baby what to do, much like real children on a playground.
Oh, abed, but-- Annie, let's find the tin man's heart later.
Abed, how much stuff do you have here and what can we make with it?
- That depends.
- on?
On what you can imagine.
Baby abeds: Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Welcome.
You are the first to make it to the throne of hawkthorne.
Let me take a look at you.
According to your complexion, I think you might be Gilbert Lawson.
Is this True?
Just a moment.
Hello, Gilbert.
Due to the nature of our relationship, I'll need your electronic signature on this legally-Binding agreement.
it dictates that you will never, ever besmirch the Hawthorne name with Any outlandish notions regarding you genealogical origins.
You are the bastard offspring of a colored seductress and an unknown, weak-Willed miscegenist it's a simple question, Gilbert.
Do you agree?
Thank you for being honest, Gilbert.
No!
I'm your son!
I'm sorry, Gilbert.
I always knew you'd disappoint me.
Baby abeds: Cool cool cool!
Cool Cool cool!
Cool Cool cool!
Ah, I see you've chosen teamwork.
A coward's strategy.
I will upgrade your challenge accordingly.
?
T× ?
T× I bequeath my fortune to no inferiors.
?
T× ?
T× - Yeah!
- Attack!
What's this now?
Whoo hoo hoo hoo!
Here we go!
Get him!
Aim for the joints!
Baby  Cool cool cool!
Cool Cool cool!
- Take that!
- Get him!
Die, racism!
Troy and  ?
T× Troy and abed shooting lava ?
T× Yeah!
Take that!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Oh, no!
Aah!
Hey!
Look at me now, dad!
Aah!
I suppose you're wondering, player, why record myself breathing weird and letting you destroy me.
Because I am a man of honor.
So you've earned the pleasure of my death.
But I didn't.
I'm not the one that beat you.
Yes, you are.
We're forfeiting.
Stations one through seven abandoned.
Players disqualified.
Gilbert, you're right.
You were more his son than me.
You took all his crap and you didn't even get to take his name.
He once sat on me in church just so he could see better.
We've only been playing this game a couple of hours.
You've been playing it your whole life, and now it's time for your reward, brother.
So get in there and kill our dad.
Thank you, Pierce.
Wait a second.
Here, take this.
- oh!
- Whoa!
- You may need it.
- Oh, Pierce.
You really don't know how this works, do you?
Are you always carrying that?
Not in the shower.
I'd like to thank you again for today and offer my apologies for my conduct.
I wasn't myself.
Family can make a person do a lot of crazy things.
I understand.
I have an uncle who makes his own pizza.
- don't worry about it.
- Yeah, totally.
if it would make it up to any of you in any way, there's a bar in town called skeepers, and I hear they make a specialty drink-- a Margarita, in fact, and it's served in a glass an entire yard long.
My treat.
- Score.
This is the greatest day of my life.
I've always wanted to have a brother.
Hey, Hey, settle a bet.
The word "Mulatto, " is it okay or just borderline?
- We apologize for him.
- Oh, that's okay.
He's family.
Hilda, my love, I said I'd come back for you.
I don't know.
I just think that in a parallel universe, blorgons are-- - hold on.
a baby.
I wasn't expecting this.
guess we'll have to support it.
I guess I could get some kind of job, maybe at beans and more.
I'll probably have to work double shifts, but-- Oh, I see.
While you're off, climbing the ladder at beans and more, I'll just stay home and raise him alone.
That's fine.
I'll just give up on my dreams.
- Here we go.
- What?
He needs to learn a strong man can cry.
So, what were you saying about blorgons?
They're actually called glorbons.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
A new day has dawn at Greendale Community College.
Some said we'd never bounce back after the unfortunate events of the Star-Burns wake riot instigated by the Greendale Seven.
But today the guilty parties have been expelled, enrollment is up, and tuition is more affordable than ever.
And the architect of this modern-day miracle?
Security chief Benjamin Franklin Chang, a man who has brought security, harmony, and success to what is fast becoming the area's premier community college.
Greendale's never been better.
Thanks, Chang.
You see?
It's not the real Dean.
Of course.
The head of security at Greendale Community College has kidnapped the Dean and replaced him with a deanel-ganger.
Well, when you say it that way, it sounds ridiculous.
Yeah, the word we used was doppel-deaner.
Look, I hate cops.
You have to do something.
Isn't this a felony?
Chang is holding a man against his will.
The real Dean never would have expelled us.
He loved us.
Unfortunately, love is not admissible evidence.
Oh Love is not admissible evidence I'm working on a cop opera.
Cop-ra!
Police-ical!
Fine.
We'll get some proof.
No, you won't.
If I catch any of you within 50 feet of Greendale, I'll throw you all in jail.
Thanks for the hot water.
Wait, cop-ra!
Give me some more time in a dream give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said it can be here we could be roped up tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one, they all just fade away - I'm watching you.
- Move along.
How's the planning going for my birthday Chang-stravaganza?
The magician's booked, and the invitations went out to the school board and the budweiser frogs.
Perfect.
Yeah, um, one little snag.
See, we're kind of running out of money, what with all the students dropping out and the cost of your throne.
It's a prescription throne.
I have back mumps.
Don't look it up.
It's rare.
But you might be right.
We should free up some revenue for entertainment at the party.
Where's my deanel-Chang-er?
Fire the custodial staff.
Okay.
Cool.
Do you think I could get out a little early?
My wife's getting her braces off, and I - No.
- Okay.
I love how binoculars make far away things seem like they're close.
- They're like - Telephones for your eyes.
Snagged one of those flyers.
First Chang kidnaps the Dean, and now he throws himself a birthday party?
It's just like Stalin back in Russia times.
Dance-off?
Sundae bar?
One of those Ed Hardy street magicians?
What kind of monster would Photo booth with props!
Chang's got to be holding the Dean on campus, but there's no way we're gonna get past those guards.
We need somebody on the inside.
I may know a guy.
And the air-conditioning repair annex won't admit to any knowledge of what's going on.
But the fact is, wherever there is air, we have eyes.
Gross.
Suffice it to say, if Chang were holding your Dean captive, it'd be pretty foolish to hold him on campus.
It'd be even more foolish to hold him in a central air room in the cafeteria, which we monitor.
Oh, no, Jeffrey.
Looks like PB and J again.
You win the bet.
So he's in the cafeteria building?
Suppose he is.
In the basement.
And suppose you wanted to get to him.
Suppose you actually managed to make it past the guards at the front, there's 50 more inside, armed to the teeth with stun batons and misplaced sexual aggression.
Let's say you happen to get past them and then you get to meet Chang's number one, Joshua, a 4'10", 105-pound bucket of piss and zit cream.
I cannot express to you how much I hate this kid.
Now, beyond that dog sneeze in a pair of reeboks, you're gonna find a state-of-the-art keypad on the basement door.
And just for extra fun, they change the code every day, and the only copy is locked up in Chang's office.
Now, just for a lark, let's pretend you actually make it down to the basement door.
Who is there to greet you?
Another guard and another lock to which there is only one key.
And where is that key?
Well where is it?
Oh, sorry, it's very clear in my head.
Key's around Chang's neck.
The point is, you're not getting down there without our help.
So help us.
We have no horse in this race, but there is one thing we want.
Not a lot of people get a second chance.
Just you and probably Obama.
Give it some thought.
Great, so according to Troy's intel, Greendale is impregnable.
- So what do we do?
- Only one answer.
Elaborate heist?
Elaborate heist?
We'll need disguises.
I do a great swami.
Of course it works best with a cobra, but if you guys cut me a length of garden hose Are we all forgetting that if we get caught on that campus, we go to jail?
Do you know how long someone as sarcastic as I am would last in prison?
Such a long time.
There's got to be a practical way to do this.
There is another way in.
If I enroll in the AC school, they'll help us.
We could walk in and out.
It'll mean I'll have to move out of here and into AC school housing, and I won't be able to hang out with you guys anymore, or have a relationship, or use the word "sensational" for some reason.
Troy, we are not losing you to save the Dean or Greendale Or anything, ever.
Don't be so dramatic, Troy.
The answer is simple.
We just have to plan an elaborate heist.
- Yes.
- Great, I'll get my turban.
Everyone except Pierce has to plan an elaborate heist.
Happy birthday, Ben.
On behalf of the school board.
Shower organizer?
Are you guys psychic?
Well you deserve it.
You have worked wonders here.
Oh, you boners.
Now go party your butts off.
Your butt could use it, Richie.
Listen up, men.
Keep an extra deep lookout for the Greendale Seven.
I won't have them ruining my 25th birthday.
Yes, sir.
By the way, your cake just arrived.
Shirley will enter first through the loading dock disguised as the chef.
From there, she'll head into the kitchen.
You had time to build a tiny working water fountain, and I'm a pinecone?
Chang eats the sun and drinks the skies and they both go with him when he dies Once in, she'll unload the goods.
This girl in Chicago won't stop facebooking me.
Looks like j-swag's going deep dish.
Then it's time for phase two Toilet trouble.
Oh, crap!
Someone call a plumber!
Sounds like you schnooks got a flood the size of my wife's attitude problem.
Whoa, you guys aren't the usual plumbers.
Oh, Mr. Brand Loyalty over here.
Okay, okay, why don't you two slap-arounds give me your names for the report in case Chang wants to know why his birthday party turned into the frickin' Poseidon adventure.
Okay, okay.
Follow me then.
Finally.
Oof baboof with you two.
Here's your problem.
You people gotta start chewin' your food.
We may have to tap into the hydraulic flap valve, so don't be alarmed if things get a little noisy.
Like my wife's mouth.
If we can break through this wall and into Chang's office, then we'll have access to the basement door codes.
Meanwhile, I'll take care of cancelling the magician.
Yeah, sorry, Mr. Nightshade, gig's canceled.
How's it coming with the guard?
Boys are pathetic.
Two days of facebooking with this Joshua kid and he's eating out of my hands.
"Got a new flavor of lip balm.
Meet me at Chili's in ten minutes".
Sheep.
Um, I just want to reiterate that this should be the only time you seduce a child over the internet.
I know.
Chili's?
Sick!
Hey, bro, you watch my post?
Yeah, whatever.
'Sup.
I'm in.
Cue the abra cadabra.
Is that me in my swami disguise?
No, Pierce, for the last time, you're in the getaway van because your swami act is notoriously horrible.
"A," that is racist.
"B," swamis can't drive they're Indians.
Pierce, just do your part.
Leave the entertainment to Britta and me.
Ricky Nightshade, the rock and roll magician.
I'm starting.
I need a volunteer.
I'll kill anyone who raises their hand.
Pick a card and look at it.
Strap him!
I'm in.
Okay, it was just my head before, but now I'm really in.
Bingo.
I'm in.
Where's the key?
- I'm in.
- I know.
Well, everybody else got to say it.
Is this your card?
Huh?
I don't remember.
Nightshade, nightshade!
Greetings, greetings, baba ghanoush.
Take me to the birthday boy.
Wait a minute.
Pierce?
No, not knowing this Pierce.
I I am a mystical swami.
I come to boogie down, I'm boogying down.
Hey!
Jeff, we've been made.
Cover me!
Winger!
No!
Everything all right, Ben?
Peachy keen, Avril Lavigne.
Nathan, tell me you got eyes on the Dean.
Negative, the pixie has left the toadstool.
No!
Where's my monitor?
Gotcha.
Code Chang.
All units converge on the south library hallway.
The best part of the plan is that at a certain point, it's going to look like the plan is failing.
But that's when it's going to turn out that the failing plan was all part of the plan.
Chang eats the sun and drinks the sky Hey, Johnny Passerby, this job's getting bigger than my wife's credit card bill at Marshalls.
I mean, they got great stuff, I know that.
Anyway, I'm going to need your Dean for approval.
Craig.
Is that "a-i" or "i-a"?
I always forget.
Oof baboof, I spilled plumber's acid all over yous.
What do I do?
What do I do?
Take off your clothes.
Nathan, tell me you got eyes on the Dean.
Negative, the pixie has left the toadstool.
Repeat, the pixie has left the toadstool.
Jeffrey!
Oh Hey, Britta.
How the Chang?
I'm contaminated with plumber's acid, but it's okay, they're coming back with a lotion.
Sar-cas-tic claps.
Pretty clever.
A plan that looked like it failed, and then turned out to work.
Too bad your real plan really failed.
What's so funny?
You idiot.
The plan was for the plan to seem like it was failing.
You think you caught us, but we've already made it out with the real Dean.
Ocean's eleven, baby.
Pierce, I'm the real Dean.
Getting caught the first time was part of the plan.
This time is because we suck.
Shirley, where the hell did you come from?
- You can't hold us here forever.
- I don't need to, Winger.
I just wouldn't want you to leave before the big fireworks show.
Fireworks show?
It's a surprise for the end of the night planned by the "Dean".
Only, silly Dean, he stored all the fireworks in the records room.
Aw.
And when the works "accidentally" go off when I hit the final note on my awesome keytar solo, they'll burn up the school's records and all evidence of my misdeeds.
Chang, you're insane.
You're still into keytar?
We're going to tell the board what you did!
We're going to tell the board what you You think they'll believe the Greendale Seven and the worst Dean ever over the guy who just nailed an awesome solo?
You're going to burn down the school and kill everyone!
Fire can't go through doors, stupid.
It's not a ghost.
I know this is a bit of a long shot, but I don't suppose any of you paid my rent?
Thank you, everyone, for joining in my celebration.
As many of you know, I ate my twin sister in utero.
So on my birthday, I try to remember I'm a winner.
This one's for you, Connie.
And a-one, a-two, a Chang, Chang, Chang-four.
We're all going to die.
We have to get out of here.
How?
It's a miracle.
What?
- Yes!
- Let's get out of here!
Come on, come on, come on.
No, Troy, you didn't There's no time.
We gotta go.
Six guards, two on scooters.
Chang started his solo.
Knowing him, that gives us only nine minutes to get to the records room.
We'll need a distraction.
You heard the lady.
Take your tops off.
I might have something.
To supplement Greendale's budget, I've been renting the school out for raves on the weekend.
They call it "academania".
It's mostly hard house, some some dubstep, - but totally - Perfect.
Troy and Abed, you make a run for it.
Dean, I think it's time to party.
Hmm.
Hey, what the freak?
What's going on?
No!
No!
No!
- You weigh nothing!
- I can't see them.
They're too many of them.
- Oof.
- Baboof.
Which wire do I cut?
There's only one.
God, I hope I'm right.
Study group!
You did it!
So we're done, right?
We're done?
Done?
Done?
Done?
Not done.
You foiled me for the last time.
So, it ends as it began.
It didn't begin this way.
What the hell's going on in here?
Hey, fellas.
I just caught the Greendale Seven trying to burn down the school.
I'm a hero.
How about that cake?
He's lying.
He kidnapped the Dean.
Yeah, we gathered that much when we found these two slap-fighting in the hallway.
You stole my life!
It is hard out there for a fake Moby!
Carl, Richie, let me ex-Chang.
I'm not getting paid, am I?
Hey!
So a madman in a Napoleon costume ran the school into the ground and almost blew it up?
Yeah.
And on our watch.
What happened to us?
Well, I have a drinking problem.
We're going to get fired.
Only a matter of time until everyone finds out what happened here.
Nobody can sit on something this big.
I'll sit on it.
When I became Dean, I made a pledge to swallow this school's failures and spit out degrees because that's what deans do.
You'd do that for us?
No.
I do it for Greendale.
Aw.
It's great to have you back, Craig.
It's almost as if you were never unknowingly gone.
Yard margs at Skeeper's.
Perfect.
I left my credit card there.
Thanks, Craig.
You guys saved me.
I don't know how I will ever repay you.
You already have.
Troy, you don't have to do this.
The AC school has no claim on your soul.
No, but I do.
A man's only as good as his word, or his nod through a camera to a guy with a button.
It's time.
Say your goodbyes.
Shirley, never change.
Or do, if you want, I'm not your boss.
Oh, honey.
Never wear a rubber.
Never listen to Pierce.
Whenever you finally finish that Jigsaw puzzle Will you tell me what kind of boat is at the end of that dock?
This is a lock of my hair.
Creepy.
All right, let's go.
Abed?
What did he say to you?
He said, "I know you hate when people do this in movies".
Sorry I got emotional.
Troy Barnes.
Welcome home.
I'm really digging this hard house!
It's quite a groove.
This is my school!
It's called Greendale, and I'm the Dean of the entire school.
I mean, I wasn't for a while, but it's a long story.
You guys, everybody, you should come by during the day sometime.
It's totally different.
Really, stop by.
It'll blow your minds.
You can meet my best friend, Jeffrey.
Sure, I'll take a back rub.
Who's asking?
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
So cellular mitosis is what?
I miss Troy.
Wrong, and stop guessing that.
Annie.
I'm worried about Abed.
He hasn't left the apartment since Troy moved out.
He won't even play in the Dreamatorium.
Sorry, not "play".
"Render imaginated dreamscapes".
Guys, we just finished retaking biology all summer, and if I don't pass this final, it was for nothing.
Can we stay on target?
Did someone say "sexy construction worker"?
- Ooh!
- Stay stay on target.
I'm dressed like this because I'm building to big news.
Subway has officially ended its agreement with Greendale, and the restaurant I've chosen to occupy the cafeteria kiosk is Shirley's Sandwiches!
I just need one of you to sign this as the official owner of the business.
Ooh, we should both sign it, we're 50-50 partners.
But there's only one dotted line on the form, so - Oh, well, Pierce can - Me.
- Hey!
- I paid for it.
Well, there'd be no "it" to pay for if I hadn't done all the work.
My goodness, this molehill is becoming a mountain.
You guys work it out, while I put together an Alpine costume.
I knew eventually you'd try to box me out of my own business, just like Hawthorne Wipes did.
I'm not letting you guilt me into letting you call yourself the owner of my company.
Jeff!
Hello?
Get involved.
No.
I am here to replace my fake bachelor's so I can get back to my life as a lawyer.
Nobody else is sacrificing their interests.
Don't ask me to sacrifice mine.
Don't ask me to sacrifice mine.
That's you just now.
Okay, so name the stages of mitosis.
- Ooh, I gotta go.
- Unbelievable.
Today is Abed's first therapy session.
His what?
He's been feeling extra vulnerable lately having lost Troy to the air conditioning repair school, so he's finally gonna let me practice my psych skills on him.
Give me some credit, Winger.
What's the worst that could happen?
Classic tee-up.
Shut up, Leonard, I know about your crooked wang.
No such thing as bad press.
Hey, Abed.
This can't be good.
Give me some rope tie me to dream give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said it could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away There are those who ask, why connect the capillary tube directly to the compressor valve?
Oh, sure, why not just attach it to the moisture accumulator?
Hey, Troy.
We boring you?
I miss my friends.
- He misses his friends.
- Aww.
Mr. Barnes Gather your things and come with me.
Now!
The sun chamber.
A shameful relic from a savage chapter of our history.
Repairmen would duel each other inside, losers succumbing to heat exhaustion, or worse.
Troy, there is a prophesy.
I miss Abed so much.
I'm ashamed to confess that I once thought that this might be me.
Now I realize that it's you.
You are the true repairman, Troy.
You fix not only air conditioners but the men who fix them.
It's a trade school.
It's a two-year degree in boxes that make rooms cold.
Sir, there's been a flow duct rupture in quadrant four.
I'll handle it.
This is your destiny, Mr. Barnes.
The true repairman will repair man.
Abed.
I'm not talking to you because I'm not crazy.
Think of it as inner dialogue.
I'm reading the novelization of Chronicles of Riddick.
Can you honestly tell me that's a saner decision?
You're worried you'll go crazy without Troy.
That's why you're gonna let Britta fix you, right?
Because you think you're broken, you're gonna get diagnosed by someone who said her favorite superhero was "x-man"?
I'm a little scared.
Things are bad.
When the world gets bad enough, Abed, the good go crazy.
But the smart They go bad.
Come on in here, let's talk about it.
I think it's safer if I talk to Britta.
I think it's even safer if I talk to her first.
Hello.
Are you here to help me with biology, or get me to help you?
- Bi-ol-o-gy.
- Are you lying?
Hard to break the word "yes" into lilting syllables, huh?
Ye-es?
Look, Pierce and I are so close to getting the sandwich shop going.
I just need you to help Look.
You want one piece of free advice?
Let Pierce cool down.
You know how crazy and paranoid he can get.
A-ha!
Crazy?
Paranoid?
Impotent?
- Cellular - I knew you'd run to Jeff, and turn him against me.
Mitosis.
Guys, why are we yelling?
You sign that paper, I'll sue.
Well, hold on.
This will be settled in Greendale court, 3:00 P.M. Obviously, Shirley has her counsel, and I get to dress like a judge.
I was born in a courtroom, sued it for my own placenta, and won.
Now I'm calling my lawyer.
My biology final is at 5:00.
I'm available from 3:00 to 4:00.
I'll see you in court.
Hello, Abed?
Ready to get therapized?
Abed?
Hello, Britta.
Come in.
What's going on?
Vice Dean Laybourne was repairing a flow duct rupture, and he inhaled a lethal dose of freon.
May his breeze join the wind.
Okay, so mitosis is when cells divide I wonder who Pierce is gonna get to represent him.
I promise, whoever Pierce brings won't be prepared for me.
That's the Winger guaran Is that the cold-blooded former colleague that got you fired from your old law firm by ratting on you to the state bar?
Tee.
You know, Alan working at your former firm and all?
Hey, Pierce just did you the biggest favor of your life.
He hired a guy I've spent the last two years fantasizing about stabbing in the Sundance!
- Tango!
- Hey.
So The case of the sandwich signature.
What are you doing here?
I mean, me, I have to, but you?
Hawthorne's a cash cow, and old a-con here is tugging at that teat.
That's money.
Money.
Please stop that.
So full disclosure.
The firm would really like to keep vitamin "p" in its medicine chest.
Full disclosure.
I really want to be done by 4:00.
Oh, that's the Jeff wing basket I remember loving.
Hey, just go easy on Shirley.
Scout's honor, Sinead O'Connor.
Oy-yay, oy-yay, the honorable Craig Pelton presiding.
First off, there's one decision I'll need your help making.
Judging Amy or Judge Judy?
You say your name is Evil Abed, which does not throw me, because I'm a therapist.
So let's talk about evil.
You know what?
Maybe I should talk to Good Abed instead.
Where I come from, his name is Lame Abed.
- And you come from - The darkest timeline.
You might call it the Britta of timelines, where everything is the worst.
Jeff has one arm there.
Annie shot Pierce.
Troy can't speak Ah!
Now we're getting somewhere.
I think lame Abed sent you to talk because you're more equipped to deal with fear.
That's the lame way of seeing it, yes.
Here's the truth.
I've crossed into your dark timeline, and now I'm going to darken it.
How?
Tell me about your parents, Britta.
Um No?
Barnes, you should be in the chapel.
We lost a great man today.
Yeah, he was the best, wasn't he?
That's why I don't understand how he could rupture a freon line.
That's kind of a rookie mistake.
I'm sure it was just a faulty valve.
My first order as vice Dean, I'm gonna have them all replaced.
So you're vice Dean now?
Why the sudden interest in air conditioning repair?
I thought you missed your friends.
- I do.
- Then go be with them.
I'm releasing you.
- But you - Goodbye, Troy.
Miss Edison, do you recognize the baby in that picture?
That's Shirley's baby Ben.
Would you think less of Shirley Bennett if she offered to sell Ben on craigslist for a chance to bump it with Denzel?
That was a joke for my cousin.
Damn those Facebook privacy settings.
Jeff, do something.
He's got nothing.
I'm sure she didn't mean that.
Or perhaps she doesn't even love that baby, because she spent most of last year not even knowing who the father is.
Objection.
Establishing character, your honor.
This woman is clearly unfit to own a sandwich shop.
Alan, come on.
No furths.
I thought you said you were gonna go easy.
Felt easy to me.
What was he wearing?
He was dressed as a dinosaur.
Is that why you dropped out of High School?
I don't know.
Are those even real glasses?
No.
Ah, do you feel that, Britta?
Your timeline's 10% darker now.
This was 10%?
Do you know what kind of person becomes a psychologist, Britta?
A person that wishes, deep down, that everyone more special than them was sick, because "healthy" sounds so much more exciting than "boring".
You're average, Britta Perry.
You're every kid on the playground that didn't get picked on.
You're a business casual potted plant, a human white sale.
You're VH1, Robocop 2, and Back to the Future 3.
You're the center slice of a square cheese pizza.
Actually, that sounds delicious.
I'm the center slice of a square cheese pizza.
You're Jim Belushi.
Ah.
Where are you going?
To make this timeline the darkest of all.
Starting with your lame hero, Jeff Winger.
I don't suppose lame Abed owns a bone saw.
So, Pierce, you're seeking full ownership of Shirley's Sandwiches.
After all, you did provide Correct.
You really did?
Oh, damn it.
Jeez, I came to this thing unprepared.
I mean, I-I guess it's my job to somehow tarnish you in the eyes of the court, but, uh Let me check my notes.
Take your time.
Thanks.
Hey, uh, while I'm doing this Does anybody know any funny jokes?
I do.
An Irish and a Jew walk into a Chinese laundry With a gay duck.
- All right, okay!
- Oh, right!
So you're telling me they're not good at basketball?
I have no questions, your honor.
Cruel.
Cruel, cruel, cruel.
In the name of the five winds East, West, North, the one we keep secret, and South, I hereby proclaim you This ceremony is a lie.
And having a special room for it is a waste of valuable floor space.
You are no longer a student here.
And we use this room for yoga on weekends.
Remove him.
I am the truest repairman.
And this man is a dishonor to making air conditioners work good.
And I have the right to challenge him In the sun chamber.
Holy crap.
Your less than honor, can I call a recess?
Ooh, yay, costume change.
Court briefly adjourned.
What are you trying to do, Winger?
Zealously represent your client?
Let me make things a little easier for you.
Figure out a way to throw this case, or figure out where you're gonna work when you get out of here, because I don't know where it's gonna be if it's not for us.
That's right, Jeff.
I went there.
You drove me there.
Miss Daisy's in the house, thanks for the ride, sorry about slavery.
Don't oversell your clout, Alan.
You're partner because I sold you to Ted.
Ted respects me Ted's gone.
He got too old, couldn't swim with the sharks, and got eaten.
That makes no sense.
He started the firm.
You can't lose your own firm.
You can if you're dead.
That shark thing was not a metaphor.
I'm the big dog now.
So you want the last three years in this toilet to have a point?
Then I'm the guy you got to make happy.
Or, you know, you could finish up your big win here.
Court is in session.
Blind Justice presiding aah!
Oh, my God!
Ahh!
Oh, one more recess.
I hit the corner right on a fresh tattoo.
Well boys and girls I hope you brought your popsicles, because it's about to get scalding hot in the sun chamber.
You already know the rules Because there aren't any!
Jeez, Dennis, are you on coke?
Take that crap off and sit down.
Sorry about that.
Of course there are rules.
Two men are sealed in the chamber, each with a broken unit.
The heat will increase until one man yields or dies.
Begin!
You're just in time for Jeff's closing statements.
Who cares?
Everything is terrible.
Oh, no.
Have you been watching Dance Moms again?
I'm thinking of dyeing my hair.
Evil Abed, what are you doing?
I'm going to cut off Jeff Winger's arm.
I won't let you.
That's horrible.
Don't you mean dark?
Welcome to my world.
Psst!
Jeff!
Winger!
Jeffrey, this is a a terrible situation for me to have put you in.
A guy like Alan isn't above making trouble for you at your old firm.
Shirley, I It's not worth your career.
I want you to have what you want.
- Thank you, Shirley.
- Settle down.
Okay, Jeffrey, let's have your closing statement.
Your honor I have no closing statement, because I'm throwing the case.
No, no, it's okay.
It's fine, don't worry.
My client, Shirley Bennett, my friend of three years, she told me that it was okay.
She said what I want was more important.
She's right, right?
I mean, guys like me, we'll tell you there's no right or wrong.
There's no real truth.
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you just like I killed him.
And as long as we all believe that, guys like me can never lose.
Was that out loud?
Because the truth is I'm lying when I say there is no truth.
The truth is the pathetically, stupidly, inconveniently obvious truth is Helping only ourselves is bad, and helping each other is good.
Now I just wanted to get out of here, pass biology, and be a lawyer again instead of helping Shirley.
That was bad.
And my former colleague wanted so badly to keep his rich client that he just asked me to roll over in exchange for my old job.
So I guess we all walked in here pretty bad.
But now Shirley's gone good.
Shirley's helping me.
It's that easy.
You just stop thinking about what's good for you, and start thinking about what's good for someone else.
And you can change the whole game with one move.
Now if you like this idea, you can make it true by doing something good for everyone here.
Throw this case out of court.
It's dumb.
That is all.
I withdraw my case.
Why didn't you just do some inspirational speech about friendship?
You're fired.
Way to go, soft serve.
You're finished.
By the way, never got a chance to tell you this, but it was me who turned you in to the state bar.
I know.
And I never got a chance to thank you.
This place has made you so gay.
Hey!
Don't use "gay" as a derogatory term.
Booyah, good person.
Gentlemen, take this man to the infinite labyrinth of eternal ice.
- Yes!
- No!
No, take him to the police.
He murdered someone.
Take him to jail.
You guys are weird.
Jeff, that was great.
You were like a white Blair Underwood.
Shirley, if you're willing, I think we should let Jeff sign the sandwich shop form.
Yeah, you could represent both of us.
You know, like our attorney.
My God, Pierce!
You had your first good idea.
- Thank you.
- Britta, I'm so sorry.
It doesn't matter, Abed.
I should've never played therapist with you.
I'll change my major just one more time.
But you can't.
You cured me.
I mean, I'm not cured.
I'm willing to admit I definitely need therapy.
You're the only kind of shrink I could ever trust.
The kind with as little control over my mind as me.
Mind if I cut in?
Troy!
You're back.
Yeah, I made a new rule that the air conditioning repair school has to act like a regular school.
I can do that because I'm their messiah.
Cool.
I went crazy and I wanted to cut off Jeff's arm.
I missed you so much, buddy.
So, Jeff, we still best friends?
All right.
Cellular mitosis.
What is it?
Give me some rope tie me to dream give me the hope to run out of steam somebody said it could be here we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year but I love you more than words can say I can't count the reasons I should stay one by one they all just fade away I'm tired of the wait and sees I'm tired of that part of me that makes up a perfect lie to keep us between but hours turn into days so watch what you throw away and be here to recognize there's another way Hello, everybody.
I'm Leonard.
And I'm here today to review Let's Potato Chips.
$1.79 at Kroger's.
Ah.
Get this sucker open Ah, there we are.
Now, I've already had some of these, but let's see.
Mmm!
Crispy.
Mm-hmm.
Salty, not too greasy.
That one's shaped like a duck.
Well, I guess that's definitely a buy.
That's it.
Let's Potato Chips are good, and they're a buy.
I'm as high as hell, you're about to get shot
