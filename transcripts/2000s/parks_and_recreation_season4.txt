{START OF EPISODE 1}
Excuse me.
- Are you Leslie Knope?
- Yes.
We are part of a group that tries to identify potential candidates for political office here in town.
Are you theoretically interested in running for office?
Abso-toot-ly I am.
Very sorry that I just used that word.
Before we go any further, I need you to tell me is there a scandal out there?
Is there anything at all you need to tell us about your life?
Nope.
Who were the suits?
They want me to run for office.
Oh, my God!
Leslie, yea!
I know, right?
Yea.
- Yea!
- Yea!
- Yea!
- Yea!
Wait, what does that mean about you and Ben?
I don't know.
I think it's gonna be really bad.
Uh-oh.
You just wanna go back to saying "yea"?
Yes, please.
- Okay, yea.
- Yea.
Yea.
- Knope, follow me.
- Just one second.
- Now!
- Ron, hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ron!
Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron!
What's going on?
My ex-wife Tammy is back.
Yeah, I saw her in the courtyard.
No, my other ex-wife Tammy.
Tammy one.
I have accrued 228 personal days.
Starting right now, I'm using all of them.
While I'm gone, you're in charge.
Ah!
Also, I keep a sizable supply of ground chuck in my desk.
Remove it or it will begin to smell.
Godspeed.
- Hi, Ron.
- Move!
Whoa!
Ah, geez.
Warning!
High levels of swagger coming through.
Tommy Haverford back in the Parks Department.
Entertainment720 hockey jersey, anybody?
Branded mouse pad?
Entertainment720 is just a little multi-national that I started with my boy Jean-Ralphio.
What exactly do we do?
Let's just say it's too hard to explain.
Donna, you look amazing.
How are the kids?
- I don't have kids.
- Wow.
- How long has it been?
- Three weeks.
So did you get a chance to look at my sample position papers?
How do you feel about my stance on Egyptian debt relief?
Uh, well, it probably won't come up in a local City Council election.
But your thoroughness, as always, is impressive.
Thank you.
Now, we have three months.
I think we should start talking strategy.
My strategy is to win.
I've been dreaming about running for public office my whole life.
While other girls were playing with Barbies, I was playing with a Geraldine Ferraro action figure that I made myself from a picture of her that I glued onto a popsicle stick.
See you next week?
Okay, I'm looking forward to it.
Hey!
What-- - Who was that?
- Uh Lady--just ladies.
Meeting for the ladies' yacht club.
- Anchors away, ladies.
- What?
Just don't-- Ladies' yacht club?
I cannot believe you haven't told him yet.
After I tell him, I'm running for office, we're gonna have to break up.
Why can't you just keep sneaking around?
Ann, you beautiful, naive, sophisticated, newborn baby.
What?
Before, if people found out, we would maybe lose our jobs.
Now, if people find out, it's gonna be a major scandal.
My campaign will be over before it begins.
- What are you gonna do?
- I have a plan.
And it's really good.
I'm gonna postpone telling him until you figure out what I'm supposed to do.
So get crackin'.
How is this on me?
Fine!
I'll do it.
God, who keeps emailing me?
- A penis.
- What?
Oh, my God.
Oh-- It's emailing me too.
Whoever this is sent it to every woman in the entire government.
Oh, my God.
He's gonna be so embarrassed.
I mean, that's a crazy accident.
No, Andy, he did it on purpose.
You know what?
Respect.
That's a baller move.
Pun intended.
Excuse me.
Chris, Jerry's making us look at dirty pictures on his computer.
It is exactly because of that lewd photo that I am here.
Ben and I are launching a full investigation.
And I want to apologize to all the women And Jerry.
If I could go back in time, and cut your eyeballs out, I would.
- Wow, that is so sweet.
- Thank you.
We are getting a lot of media requests about this.
So Leslie, can you do Perd Hapley?
Ho!
She can do Perd Hapley.
Hi-oh!
Seriously, can you do his TV show?
Oh, yeah.
Andrew my man-drew, what are you up to?
I'm about to do an experiment where I huck this at the wall and see what happens.
But that can wait.
Shoe shine?
Andy, I'm gonna be honest.
I came here today to talk to you.
Now look, you're enthusiastic.
You're hard-working.
You can lift heavy things.
I think there might be a place for you over at Entertainment720.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
It's my company!
I don't know, Tom.
I mean, I'm just now getting really good at shoe shining.
And I mean, I'm still pretty bad at it.
Let me ask you this.
Are you living your dreams?
- I don't know, Tom.
- Well, I'm living mine.
And if you wanna live yours, here's my card.
- It's impossible to read.
- Black print, black background.
It's the coolest possible color scheme.
- Yeah.
- It's also a strong magnet.
So don't put it in your wallet.
It will erase your credit cards, guaranteed.
Destroy my credit cards.
Debt and everything?
Mr. Mayor, I promise you that we will find the owner of that weiner and we will punish him.
Good-bye.
- Ann Perkins!
- Hey.
I didn't know who to come to with this, but that picture, uh--there's something very disturbing about the testicles.
I've always felt the same way myself.
The testicles are like the ears of the genital system.
They serve a very important function, but they're not that great to look at.
Okay, wow.
No, I was speaking medically.
They're enlarged.
I think that maybe that guy is sick with something-- perhaps, a hernia, or mumps.
Ann Perkins!
You really know your testes.
Thank you?
For a female perspective on this scandal, we turn to a woman, Leslie Knope.
I'm about to ask you a question right now and that question is this.
The lewd photo-- just how big a deal is it?
Well, frankly, Perd, it's not that big a deal.
If you know what I mean.
I don't know what you mean.
But it had the cadence of a joke.
When men in government behave this way, they betray the public's trust.
Maybe it's time for more women to be in charge.
There you have it, where "it" is the thing Leslie Knope just said about this situation.
Perd Hap-- How was that?
Was that okay?
Amazing.
That sound bite is gold.
You're gonna get great feedback on this, and we think we can capitalize.
You're gonna announce your candidacy on Friday.
Friday.
In three months.
No, this Friday.
Is that okay?
No, yeah.
Yes, it is great.
Okay, we'll do that then now soon.
And, um, I just have something I've been postponing for a while that I need to do, but I'll do it now.
- Great.
- Great.
Yea.
I know it.
- Ben?
- Uh, okay.
Ben?
I need to talk to you.
That was my brother.
He just had a baby girl.
Oh, my God, that's horrible.
Or good--full disclosure.
I didn't listen to what you just said.
I need to talk to you about something-- Okay, well, before you say anything, let me just show you what I got at Doug's Donuts.
It's an L-shaped eclair!
The "L" is for Leslie For your name.
Hey.
- How are you?
- Bad, really bad.
Oh, God.
How did the breakup go?
Well, I started crying because he gave me an eclair.
And then we made out and spent the night together.
But this morning in the cold light of day, I cooked breakfast and we made out some more.
Wow, you opposite-of-broke-up with him.
He gave me an eclair, Ann!
Joe, I've determined that the lewd picture was sent by you because you sent it from your personal email address, stinkmaster69@alumni.
sarahlawrencecollege.edu.
Really?
Sarah Lawrence?
Yeah.
I wanted a small college experience.
You also bragged about it to many of your co-workers.
There's an old sewage department saying.
"If you've got a nice drainpipe, there's no reason to hide it".
I doubt that's a saying.
We are terminating you effective immediately.
Is this because you're jealous?
No.
It's because you broke the law.
The law of having an amazing package.
Before we have him forcibly removed, you should know this, that one of our female employees, a nurse, examined the photo you sent her-- I bet she did.
And you have the mumps.
You might wanna get that checked.
Sweet.
Someone's got mumps on his lumps.
Up high.
Anyone?
Ron isn't here.
His ex-wife Tammy came, and he got scared and ran away.
Well, as acting manager of the Parks Department, I declare that everything you are saying is stupid.
I love you.
Hey, so Tom offered me a job again.
As my manager, what do you think I should do?
Well, what do you wanna do?
I think it'd be kinda cool to work for Tom.
So take it.
But working at a start-up can be kind of risky.
So don't take it.
But Tom told me to follow my dreams.
So take it.
- But this isn't my dream.
- So don't take it.
- I don't know what to do.
- Me neither.
You give such good advice.
Babe, I love you.
You're welcome.
Ann Perkins!
Hey.
Did you maybe tell people that I diagnosed that guy with mumps based on his porn photo?
I did!
I was so proud of you.
Okay, because now I have everyone in City Hall sending me pictures of their junk, asking me if they have mumps.
Oh, my God.
Your inbox is literally filled with penises.
- Mm-hmm.
- I am so sorry.
Oh, look.
Ed Miller from payroll.
Before I do this, is there any possible way that we could still keep dating?
We've attacked this from all angles.
Either you don't run for office-- Which is out of the question.
Or you break up with him and avoid a potential scandal.
- Do you need to get that?
- No, it's just penises.
Leslie, I don't want you to break up with him either.
- There's just no other way.
- Yeah.
Just be direct and honest.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Hmm.
It's the entire Sanitation Department for Muncie.
Ooh.
Would you like any wine to start?
Yes, and I'm gonna be direct and honest with you.
I would like a glass of red wine and I'll take the cheapest one you have because I can't tell the difference.
- I'll have the same.
- Great.
- Okay.
Here's the deal.
- Okay.
- I really, really like you.
- I like you too.
And I think I know what you're gonna say.
- I highly doubt that.
- I think I do.
- Oh, I don't.
- And, um - I got you something.
- No.
What is this?
- Is this jewelry?
- It's not, just open it.
No.
Oh, I need to go to Another place.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom-- the Whiz Palace, as we like to call it here-- and I'm going to be back and I'm not gonna split.
I'm here for you because we need to talk about stuff.
- Okay?
- All right.
Wait-- - Ron.
- What are you doing here?
Running away from my problems.
Come on in.
- Ok, so here's what's going on.
- I didn't ask.
Friday, I'm supposed to announce that I'm running for City Council, and I haven't told Ben yet.
I know I said that we broke up, but we couldn't.
We're still dating.
But now I have to break up with him for real, but I don't wanna break up with him because he's so cute.
He's so nice.
If you're gonna stay here, there are three rules you need to follow.
One, no talk about Tammy one.
Two, no talk about Ben.
Three, no talk.
I didn't even ask you last night.
What is going on with Tammy one?
You just violated rules number one and three.
You lose your coffee privileges.
Oh.
Oh, you choose, Knope-- hunting, fishing, or drinking?
I'd really love to shoot a gun right now.
Fishing it is.
And so effective immediately, all male employees must stop sending explicit photos to Ms. Perkins.
If I may, what if based on empirical evidence, I truly believe there's a grave and immediate medical emergency?
Were that the case, could I then show you my dong?
No.
- That would be harassment.
- Fair enough.
Now completely different scenario.
Let's say I've been watching a lot of women's golf and I've had some wine-- How about this?
I'm gonna get a male doctor to come in and do some screenings.
Perfect.
Just as a backup, I'm sending you some photos.
- That will not be necessary.
- That's me.
Brand-new day, brand-new merch.
I got you guys some awesome Entertainment720 stuff.
Donna, this is for you.
Entertainment720 umbrella.
Entertainment720 fly swatters.
Rubik's cube with my face on it.
Breath mints Fireplace bellows.
Anddrum roll please.
Drum roll sound effect key chain.
Shouldn't you be working at your new company, Tom?
I am working, April.
I'm making high-level network contacts.
You think Bethenny Frankel sits behind a desk all day?
She makes $100 million a year.
How much you make a year?
$101 million.
Well, I, for one, am happy to see Tom.
Thanks, Jerry!
Here.
Have an umbrella and some breath strips.
Whoa.
All right, enough chitchat, everyone.
- Please get back to work.
- You're not our boss.
- What'd you just say to me?
- Ma'am.
Sodid you get a chance to think about my offer?
Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
I wanna do my dreams, but I just don't think my dream is working for a company that puts logos on stuff.
That's not my company does.
Although, maybe we'll start.
Hey, what you think?
Donnathat looks great.
I could do without this one.
So running for office.
Now I'm gonna have to find a replacement for you.
- I might not win.
- You'll win.
- I might not run.
- You should.
What's our plan here, Knope?
I figure we build a fire, roast the fish we shot, and make s'mores.
I don't have the material for s'mores.
I do.
I always carry emergency s'more rations in my car.
Given your hunting abilities and my chocolate supply, I figure we could stay up here for twothree years.
You know, when I was 12, my brother shot me in the pinky toe with a nail gun.
Granted, it was a hilarious prank, and we all had a good laugh.
That's awful.
But I avoided going to the doctor.
I hate paperwork.
After a few weeks, the toe just kinda fell off.
You only have nine toes?
I have the toes I have.
Let's just leave it at that.
The point is the doctor said if I had come in right away, they might've saved the toe.
You can't run away from your problems.
Especially if you only have nine toes.
Sorry.
That was uncalled for.
I'm Ron Swanson.
And you're Leslie  Knope.
You with me?
Well, what is your dream?
It's to be the biggest rock star on the planet obviously.
But that could take another Don't get me wrong.
Shoe shining has been a been a pretty wild ride.
But is it possible there's something more out there for me?
Andy, there's tons of stuff you can do.
I'll help you figure it out.
- Really?
- Yes.
One year from now, you, Andy Dwyer, will no longer be a shoe shinist.
Kyle, beat it.
I wanna make out with my wife now.
But you've only done half of one of my shoes.
Here.
Now I haven't done anything.
Scram, kid.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ron!
Welcome-- Stop.
First order of business.
I promised Leslie I'd hire her a new assistant so the department doesn't completely shut down while she runs for office.
- You're running for office?
- Yeah, City Council.
- Leslie, that is great.
- Thank you.
Will you pledge right now not to raise taxes?
- I think that's premature.
- No pledge, no vote.
The point is she needs an assistant.
- Start asking around-- - Hire Andy.
- Andy can do it.
- Sure, yeah.
Done.
Andy, you are now Leslie's assistant.
Honey.
No-- Leslie, I'm gonna work my ass off for you.
I'll do anything you ask me.
I will prove myself.
You don't even have to pay me.
No, honey, no.
Tomorrow, there will be a 300-page orientation booklet as well as a dozen homemade cookies in the shape of your face.
But today There's something else I have to do.
If any of you need anything at all, too bad.
Deal with your problems yourselves like adults.
I'll be in my office, waiting for Tammy one.
You want me to find her?
There's no need.
She'll find me.
She has the tracking ability and body odor of a bloodhound.
Okay, so now you're sure that everything is okay, you know, down there?
You're perfectly healthy.
That man has the largest penis I have ever seen.
I actually don't even know if he has mumps.
Forgot to look.
I was distracted by the largest penis I have ever seen.
I know I've been acting really weird lately, and, um, I really like you.
What I'm about to say is gonna contradict the idea that I really like you, but that won't change-- So just open the box.
Please stop bringing out the box, okay?
- Leslie-- - You're being really nice, and what I'm about to say is gonna make you hate me.
Okay, then I'll just open the box for you.
Wow.
You knew?
I figured it out a while ago.
I'm sorry.
I should've told you I knew.
But I just--I wanted this to last as long as possible.
We have to break up.
Why?
Why do we have to break up?
Well, Leslie, everything you've accomplished, you have earned and you have worked for.
I don't want anyone to think that you got where you are today by sleeping with your boss.
But I really like sleeping with my boss.
YeahYeah.
Okay, look.
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
Um, it's not you, it's me.
I'm not ready for a commitment.
I just don't like you anymore.
I know it's hard to hear that, but You're boring, and frankly you disgust me.
Echh!
How did you figure it out?
Leslie, there was a dude in the ladies' yacht club.
Yeah, but I covered that pretty well.
Also, you've been making campaign speeches in your sleep.
Granted, you always do that, but they got really specific and moving.
Did I have a good opening line?
It was simple, but I liked it.
Friends, honored guests, Pawneeans.
I am Leslie Knope, and I am running for City Council.
- Hello, Tammy.
- Ronald.
That's enough small talk.
What do you want?
You remember what I do for a living, I trust?
Yes.
You ruin people's lives.
You're being audited, Ronald.
I don't care.
Then why is your mustache trembling?
I'm here as a friend.
Call it nostalgia.
Or perhaps guilt for all the times I tried to smother you in your sleep.
- I don't need your help.
- Wrong.
You do.
But as you're so fond of saying, it's a free country.
Good luck.
I hope you don't go to jail.
Sit up straight.
You're not doing your breast any favors.
Thank you.
Hi.
Your breasts are amazing.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Ok guys, a Battle Royale is coming up.
Every department, in one room, arguing for more money.
Budgetary Thunder Dome.
So uhm, make a list of why other departments suck and I gonna get the secret weapon.
Our secret weapon in this budgetary battle Ron.
Every time another department asks for more money, he just stares them down until they back off and/or wet themselves.
Hey, who's ready to get-- what are you doing?
Tammy One showed up.
I'm being audited by the IRS.
No!
Your worst nightmare.
You know what?
Screw this.
First of all, income tax is illegal.
Second, Tammy is a psychological mastermind.
This is just another way for her to put her hand up my keister and control me like a puppet.
I'd rather be locked up.
Ron, this is a federal tax audit.
You could go to jail.
Jail, Ron.
Ron, jail.
Jail, Ron, jail.
You could go to jail.
Jail, jail, jail.
Are you broken?
Andy, April!
What's up, boss?
Stop yelling and being annoying.
Grab your calculators.
Settle in.
Operation "Rescue Ron" is starting.
Don't worry.
I will think of a better name for it by tomorrow.
Here you go.
Calculator.
- Hey - Hey, man.
Ben.
Hey, thanks for texting me to hang out.
I've really felt like we've developed a cool friendship, and-- anyway, it was just nice to have that validated.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look, we got some documents over at Entertainment720 that seem really complicated.
And I thought, maybe you could take a look at them because nerd stuff probably really excites you, because you're a nerd.
No, of course.
Yeah, no, I just-- put on my Star Wars pajamas and sit in my mom's basement and pore over some spreadsheets.
Sounds great.
Yeah.
W-w-what'd you got?
Something called "Break even analysis tables".
Oh, break evens?
Those are really fun.
Yeah, sure.
I'll take a look.
Let's hit it.
What you-- right now?
Uh--I have work.
And I thought I had a friend.
All right.
It's almost too easy.
I can hear you.
I know you can, Ben.
That's how easy it is.
So we need to find proof of every tax deduction I've taken in the last five years.
Ron, most of these aren't even receipts.
This one says, "I bought supplies.
2007".
You won't find any bank statements either.
I've heavily invested in gold which I've buried in several different locations around Pawnee.
Or have I?
What's this?
Some kind of lame drug deal?
That is a gentleman's agreement.
I made that man a dining room table in exchange for 60 feet of copper pipe and a half pig.
Well, looks like we have some actual receipts here.
Same amount, every month.
What's this?
Every 30 days, I buy shotgun shells and cigarettes and send them home to my mom.
That's so sweet.
Your mom sounds kick-ass.
My first ex-wife's name is Tammy.
My second ex-wife's name is Tammy.
My mom's name is Tamara.
She goes by Tammy.
You can prevent adult-onset diabetes by getting an annual check-up, exercising, praying Okay.
Who is that guy?
That is Walt Morphling.
He was the director of public health, but he had to retire at 46 because he had diabetes.
That is sad, but also, in this town, understandable.
I would like to shoot a new PSA and I think it'd be good to get someone who's healthy and telegenic, and I thought that you would be perfect.
Ann Perkins.
I am flattered.
And I will do it.
Is there a script yet?
Uh, no, because you just approved the idea, like, three seconds ago.
I would like you to write me a script and get it to me in an hour.
And we should start thinking about wardrobe.
Casual?
Formal?
Semi-formal?
Sporty?
Scary?
Posh?
Baby?
Those are the spice girls.
I just got caught up in my own thoughts.
I'm very excited about this.
In terms of shirts, I can wear white Welcome to paradise, my man.
You can chill over there by the bar.
We also got basketball at any time you want.
There's Roy Hibbert and Detlef Schrempf.
Oh, my God.
That's an actual NBA player.
He plays for the Pacers.
NBA's on strike, so we got him for only, like, What up, Roy?
Is this all you want me to do?
Play one on one with Detlef?
Yes.
And keep your mouth shut.
Jean-Ralphio!
Take me there.
Bump!
Who are you?
- Uh-- - This is Ben.
He's here to help us with the paperwork.
Ben?
Is that your real name?
Yes.
Oh, you could do better than that.
I'ma help you out right now.
Your name is Angelo.
Angelo, thank you so much for coming out.
Get a thicker tie.
It looks weird on you.
Makes your head look like a fish.
Secondly, I don't know where the paperwork is, but when you find it, can you take care of it for us?
We don't have any pens 'cause we're afraid it's gonna leak in our shirts.
Lastly, I hate the name, Angelo.
I'ma switch it up for you, right now.
Your new nickname is Jell-o shot.
- What do you think of that, J-shot?
Do you have questions?
Yeah.
Where are we?
All right, Ben.
If you need anything, one of these models that we pay to hang around here will grab it for you.
In the meantime, we' gonna be playing video games, tweeting our high scores.
Hit it!
Um, hi.
Are you the receptionist?
I guess.
I don't really know.
If you don't mind me asking, how much are they paying you?
$100,000 a year.
With full medical.
I mean, I would guess they'll be bankrupt by the end of This sentence.
No, thank you.
Is this true?
You only spent $40 on clothes in the past 5 years?
It sounds about right.
How did you meet Tammy One?
Technically, I've known her since I was born.
She was a candy striper at the hospital.
She helped deliver me.
All: Oh, my God.
I grew up in a very small town.
Everybody knew everybody else.
We first took up together when I was 15.
- Awesome.
- Oh, my God.
It was a little scandalous, but everyone feared her, so they kept their mouths shut.
I don't even know her, but she's my hero.
No, she's no hero, April.
She's a hellacious nightmare.
She did, however, teach me everything I know.
Sunday school, sex.
She was my math teacher in middle school and my babysitter, and she taught driver's ed.
I-- Hello.
I don't believe we've met.
I am Leslie Knope, deputy-- I don't think it will be necessary for you to speak again while I'm here.
Why do I only date brunettes?
You know, sometimes you eat chicken and you get food poisoning and then, even the sight of chicken makes you sick?
Tammy One is my blonde chicken.
Good God, Ronald.
This is a much bigger mess than I imagined.
You'll take a week off from work.
We'll do a complete overhaul of your finances.
I'll need access to all your accounts, and your home.
Is that necessary?
Oh, oh.
We're playing a game where everyone says something stupid?
You.
What is your name?
Tim.
Tim Buckenowski.
Really?
No.
Andy Dwyer.
Andy You're going to collect all of this, and you're going to put it in my car.
- What-- - Ms. Knope.
Yes?
You're going to go to payroll and get copies of Ronald's workplace expense reports.
Oh, I--I'm just wondering how long that's going to take, because Ron and I have a very important meeting together.
It's called the Battle Royale.
It's super fun.
Well You and Ron have a big meeting, huh?
I'm sure Ron will remember the meeting fondly while he makes toilet wine in a federal prison in Terre Haute.
I'll--I'll head down to payroll.
Now.
You're not getting any younger.
Yes, ma'am.
She's the cold, distant mother I never had.
I love her.
Good morning, everyone.
Good morning, sir.
How can I help you?
Ron?
Your moustache fell off.
Leslie, you goofball.
Tammy pointed out that my face looked better without any hair on it.
And it did collect a lot of food crumbs, which is very unsanitary.
Hey, Jer.
Hump day, am I right, buddy?
What?
What is going on?
Where's Tammy One?
She moved in with me.
She's really helping me out.
Yesterday, she converted my bank account into a joint bank account with her.
Oh.
That's great.
And how is that gonna help?
Not sure.
When she explains it, it makes total sense.
It is so nice having her around.
Here's something neat.
Tammy's got me taking baby aspirin to lower my risk of heart disease.
Science is a miracle.
Any-who, back to the old grindstone.
These emails aren't gonna send themselves.
Diabetes can't be cured.
But it can be prevented.
Make a choice.
Make a change.
And together, we can make a difference.
What do you think?
Any notes?
Great.
Just as good, if not exactly the same as the last one.
In that last one, I left a nanosecond of a pause between the words, "together" and "we".
It felt much better.
But I'd love to try another one.
I really think we've got it.
Ann.
This is important to me because it's important to you.
I mean, you spent a lot of time and energy on writing this.
Not really.
So, it needs to be perfect.
So, let's do 1 more, then 5 more, then 20 in a row.
Hey, look who it is.
Hey, hey.
Tom.
Jean-Ralphio.
Professional basketball players.
'Sup, Jell-o shot.
Can I ask you guys a question?
How exactly are you making money?
Wanna know how we make money?
Do you wanna know how we make money?
By literally printing out our money.
We bought a printing press.
This prints bills with our faces and the e720 logo on them.
And promote the company by going to clubs and tossing the bills in the air and screaming, "Free money"!
You can't just print your own money.
This has to stop, right now.
Aww!
What's the deal, baby?
One second, you hit the party switch, and the next second, you're all business?
I need to see all of your books.
You got it, baby.
Baby!
Get him the books.
Aww, Snapple.
Are we calling everybody "baby" now?
'Cause honestly, I love that.
Are we saying "Snapple" anytime we think something's dope?
'Cause I love that, baby.
Do you know what I love?
Jell-o shot!
Uh-oh!
Hibbert, Hibbert.
All: Hup, Jell-o shot!
Jell-o shot!
Jell-o shot!
Jell-o shot!
Thank you.
We're here to serve you, friend.
I hope the rest of your day is cool beans.
Ron, what is this memo you sent to me?
You're not going to the battle royale?
I have decided not to attend this year.
Okay, first of all, it's disturbing that you wrote a memo, at all.
But you love arguing against government spending.
Why do you not wanna do it now?
Leslie, please.
The government knows what it's doing.
I'm confident that I'll-- Ouchie.
You and I are going to lunch.
We have to talk.
Let me just call Tammy first and get permission.
Oh, come on.
Tammy, I was wondering if I could go to lunch with Leslie?
Terrific.
Bye.
She says I can't go.
You're going to lunch with me.
I say you can go.
Oh, gosh.
I'm really in a pickle now.
Oh, my God.
When Ron falls for Tammy Two, he turns into a demonic sex maniac.
But this?
Neutered wimp?
This is worse.
Operation "Golden Dove" is in trouble.
Ron, there are some things I want to speak to you about but I'm not quite sure how to phrase them.
Just blurt them right out, Leslie.
Anything you say will stay between you and me.
Right, my love?
Stop fidgeting.
Sorry.
I was hoping to speak with Ron alone.
He wants me here.
He invited me.
Na-na-na-na-na.
Don't worry, Leslie.
Tammy's totally cool.
Huh, okay.
Then I'll say it to her.
You're evil, and you need to go.
Leslie, you are a panic.
Tammy, may I use the restroom?
Remember to wash your hands.
Okay, you know what?
Let's cut the crap.
Is this audit even real?
In a sense, yes.
But in another, truer sense, no, it is not.
I want Ronald back, but I had to learn about his finances, to make sure my future was protected.
I'm impressed.
He's acquired quite a bit of gold.
You gold digger.
You're literally a gold digger.
The thing I love about Tammy is she calls me on my crap.
Every guy needs that.
Okay, if you want this company to survive, you immediately need to downsize.
I mean, you don't need this airplane hangar um, I think we do.
And two, you have to keep detailed financial records.
Thank you!
I've been trying to tell them that!
Waste of time.
They wouldn't know a non-employee tax-reportable expenditure request if it bit them in the ass.
Hey guys, which two people here started their own company?
'Cause I'm pretty sure it wasn't you two bozos.
Hey!
Look, you guys can swagger around all you want, but businesses need revenue, okay?
Unless you start working on an actual plan, you're dead in a month.
That's a fact.
Ben, thanks for your time.
But with all due respect, as far as business decisions go, I think we know what we're doing.
Don't forget to grab a free iPad on your way out.
He didn't even have one.
Diabetes!
Fight it!
Not quite, but I like the energy--are we still rolling?
Yup.
Diabetes!
Okay, let's-- can we take a break?
I think that's a great idea.
I think we almost have it, and I am very excited at that prospect.
I'll cancel my four o'clock and my five o'clock and my six o'clock appointments.
I cannot believe I dated him.
For a long time.
And he broke up with me!
Fat equals splat!
As in, "you're dead"!
Is there something there?
No--no.
That--that sucked.
But there's something there.
I'm feeling it-- let's go right away!
It's magic time!
From the top, everybody.
There's no one else here.
Basically, we're being attacked by Godzilla.
And to beat Godzilla, we need Mothra.
No offense.
None taken.
I'm very flattered.
Who's this?
Who's this tall drink of water?
Andy.
Hey, Andy.
How's it hanging?
Listen, we need you to break Ron from her spell.
Can't you just move your butt around, or wear a dress made out of meat?
Well I could do all those things and have, but that bitch is crazy.
When Ron left her and we got together, she threw acid on my foot.
Eww!
Could we take a peek at it?
Listen, Tammy One was my Sunday school teacher, too.
She can pinpoint your weaknesses, and then destroy you with just one word.
And a jar of acid.
Oh, my God.
I think I have an idea that could save Ron.
Andy, don't joke around.
I have ideas, too.
You were right to come get me.
My son Ronnie always had a weakness for those ladies.
Oh, wow.
Is this Ron?
Yup.
At the age of five.
He's standing next to the first chair he ever built.
Oh, my God!
There's a room full of just guns.
Why do you have so many guns?
This is America, isn't it?
Yes.
Then I don't have to answer stupid questions while standing on my own property.
Let's go.
Okay.
Well, it's definitely Ron's mom.
Tammy?
Tammy.
Ronnie.
What's going on?
Welcome to the Battle Royale.
Right here.
Right now.
Operation "Soaring Falcon" is in its final stages.
It's time to settle this.
Ah.
An old-fashioned prairie drink-off.
What's in that jug?
It smells like jet fuel.
That's Swanson family mash liquor.
Made from the finest corn ever grown on American soil.
Its only legal use is to strip varnish off of speedboats.
If you win, he's all yours.
And if I win, I bring him back to the farm for good.
Wait, what?
That wasn't the deal.
Pour it.
I'm thirsty.
Pour me one, too, then.
Let me in here.
I'm gonna join you and if I win, Ron stays here with us.
Leslie, no, don't drink that.
We use it to burn warts off of the mules!
Poison!
Ugh!
I made a mistake.
I made a mistake.
How were we together for five months?
Well, you know, it's possible you can just date a guy because of where you are in your life emotionally.
Yeah, I suppose you're right, John.
Ann Perkins, I hate to say this, but I have a stain on my shirt.
Which means that everything we shot so far is unusable, but let's use this as an opportunity to revisit the script.
Delivery guy.
- Hey.
- Diabetes!
Had enough?
Of this watered-down baby formula?
Not even close.
Not meven clarse.
Marvin clods.
Glenn Close.
Leslie, you don't have to do this Shh!
Go to bed, Jimmy.
Wrah!
I can't feel my face.
My face is numb.
What is that?
And together, we can make a difference.
That's it.
I think we got it.
Do you think we got it?
Yes!
Yeah, we have it.
We had it seven hours ago.
Oh, Ann, I--I know that I can be intense, but I'm only trying to be the best me that I can be.
I want to thank you for this opportunity and your patience, and your intelligence, and your insight.
You really are an amazing human being.
Thank you.
Oh, right-- that's why I dated him.
Hey.
I wanted to apologize.
We brought in five accountants to look at e720 and they all said the same thing you did.
If we don't start making changes, we're gonna lose the company.
Okay.
Well, first thing you need to do: Get rid of four of those accountants.
You don't need five accountants.
Again, good advice.
Here.
You really--you need to stop giving these away like candy.
I bought that one personally.
As a thank-you.
It's an iPad.
Everybody prance, now!
prance, prance, prance, prance, prance, prance She's had enough.
Call it off.
That's not how it works.
She's out.
Wait.
I'm subbing in.
April, no--that stuff will melt the shell off a garden snail.
Whatever.
I'm Puerto Rican.
I can handle it.
, oh, my God!
Okay.
This ends now.
Ah.
Mom, you're going back to the farm.
And you, you're going back to hell.
Fine.
I got what I came for anyway.
I found your underground safe.
I stole half your gold.
That's decoy gold.
You think I'd leave my gold in a locked safe buried underground, where anyone could find it?
You don't know me at all.
Yes, I do.
I knew you the minute you were born.
And I intend to be there the minute you die.
Ron, your family's weird.
Literally, there's a-- someone reading a magazine, and someone applying nail Polish.
What's that--what is she doing?
She's just playing with an iPad.
Tom told me that chair was $27,000.
That chair that has a roof.
The--there's someone over there in a deep sleep.
She's probably being paid upwards of $100,000 a year.
There's this video of a boat.
Look at that thing.
What is that?
What are you supposed to do with that thing?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Support for Pawnee Community Radio comes from the Wendell G. and Muriel Fathwright Korbleman Foundation, and Sweetums Cares, a nonprofit group that puts umbrella hats on homeless people when it rains.
Welcome to Thoughts for your thoughts I'm Derry Murbles filling in for David Parker, who took off for eight months to study the migration patterns of our nation's squirrels.
We have not seen him since.
My guest today is author Leslie Knope.
The book: Pawnee: The greatest town in America.
I wrote a book.
The first historical guide to Pawnee.
I wrote it as a reference for myself, but then, my campaign advisor said we should make it a big, wide release.
So we had people contribute, we added pictures, and we removed a lot of my poems and emotional ramblings and pictures of unicorns, and here it is!
Leslie, could one say that a book is nothing more than a painting of words, which are the notes on the tapestry of the greatest film ever sculpted?
One could say that.
But should one?
Join us next week when David Bianculli will be filling in for Richard Chang-Jefferson, who will be filling in for me.
Leslie, would you like to take us out?
Okay.
"Please enjoy a song "from the lesbian Afro-Norwegian Funk duo, Nefertiti's Fjord".
Oh, wow.
They are terrible.
Oh, yes.
Th-they're quite awful.
But they are lesbians, so-- Usually, I only read nautical novels and my own personal manifestos, but I'm proud to make this exception.
Thank you, Ron.
I expect all of you to buy additional copies.
But I wanted the first one that you owned to be delivered and signed by me.
God, this goes on for, like, seven pages!
I started thinking about you as a woman, and as a person, and I got carried away.
Okay, mine just says, "Get well soon".
Aren't you sick?
No.
Something's off.
Leslie, I loved your book.
- I read it cover to cover.
- Wow.
I just gave it to you an hour ago.
I'm a speed reader.
I can read over 3,000 words a minute with total comprehension.
One time, I read all of Siddhartha at a traffic stop.
Pawnee's most notorious businessman in the building.
I brought some Entertainment 720 pillowcases for your pillow.
"Never stop dreaming".
Tom Haverford.
"I never do".
Chris Traeger.
Respect.
Game recognize game.
Tom, I have Pawnee Today in an hour.
Was my book selected for Joan's cook club?
Joan Callamezzo has a book club?
Joan Callamezzo started a book club four years ago.
And now she is the literary tastemaker in the town.
The Time Traveler's Optometrist, by Pawnee's own Penelope Foster.
A heartwarming story about a caveman eye doctor who travels to present-day Cincinnati and can see everything but love.
Unreadable.
Then Joan slaps her sticker on it, best seller, four years in a row.
You told me you could get me that sticker.
- Did you get it?
- I'm trying, Leslie.
But Joan got an anonymous tip that there's a factual inaccuracy in your book.
That's impossible.
I checked every detail with the historical society.
Did she say what it was?
She won't tell me.
I think she wants one of her big "gotcha" moments.
Well, she's not gonna getch me.
I found no inaccuracies.
Joan Callamezzo claims there is a mistake in my book, which there is not, and so now, she's tryin' to get me on a tiny technicality.
So just in case there is a mistake, which there is not, I need all of you fact-checking every single detail.
Jerry, I need you to hit the road and re-interview everyone who lives out of town.
On it, boss.
The rest of you, call me as soon as you find the mistake that does not exist.
Do you think there's actually a mistake in here?
I doubt it.
If there's one thing Leslie's not, it's sloppy.
She's also not brief.
This is gonna take forever.
It's just us, I hope.
I wish.
Hey, guys!
Ready to do some fact-checkin'?
Here we go.
Helping Leslie.
Okey-doke.
Hi.
Joan Callamezzo.
Oh, yeah.
Hi.
Ben Wyatt.
W-we've met.
I don't think so.
Yeah, I was on your show.
Nope.
I'm tryin' to find the words to describe this girl without bein' disrespectful Getting the book into Joan's book club will really help Leslie.
But it'll also help my company, Entertainment 720.
At the risk of bragging, one of the things I'm best at is riding coattails.
Behind every successful man Is me, smiling and taking partial credit.
Now, about Leslie's book.
Am I gonna be happy?
We'll see, won't we?
Ooh!
Wow, you guys are really cute together.
Ben, I'm cute together with everybody.
Anyone find any mistakes?
Yeah, actually.
In here, it says that Pawnee is great.
But in reality, it's terrible.
Let Tom know we haven't found anything.
Hey, I'm thinking about getting a new phone.
Do you guys like your phones?
I've never used a phone in my life.
What about you, Ron?
Do you like your phone?
Here's my goal.
I'm gonna get these two people that I've known for a long time to talk to me for five minutes.
Who am I kidding?
One minute.
One minute would be amazing.
So, Leslie.
You're a real native of Pawnee, aren't you?
Yes, I was born and raised here, Joan.
And I love the town so much, I literally wrote the book on it.
I have it right here.
And also, in this hand, right here, I have a sticker.
Which, when applied, legally determines the newest selection of Joan's book club.
UhOhWhoa!
Where-- over here?
Back here?
- Where is it now?
- Come on, stick it.
Ooh.
Oh, hang on-- Stick the sticker.
Stick the st-- No, no, no.
Not so fast.
We received a tip that you, Leslie "born and raised" Knope, were not born in Pawnee.
What?
Gotcha!
And because you lied about it, we cannot make this a book club selection.
I was born in Pawnee.
I'd stake my reputation on it.
I have to tell you, this feels like gotcha journalism.
In what way?
That way.
You put "gotcha" on my face.
After the break: Where was Leslie Knope actually born?
Pawnee!
We will pull out the world map and speculate wildly.
Joan gotcha Oh, God.
Not the gotcha dancers.
betcha thought you'd get away witcha butcha got caught, didn't ya?
Joan gotcha .
Tnat was despicable!
I am horrified at her tactics.
That said, the show was pretty lively.
Joan gotcha!
don't it hurtcha?
It's very catchy.
Okay, Ben, Tom, you stay here, stay on Joan.
Get that sticker.
Chris, Andy, we're gonna stay on schedule, and we're gonna do some damage control.
All right.
Everybody move!
Move, move, move!
This entire event is under federal jurisdiction.
Unless he's in trouble, there's only one man for the job.
Bert Macklin, FBI.
You thought I was dead?
So did the president's enemies.
Call if you need us.
Okay.
All right, so we don't have to fact-check anymore.
But Leslie wants us to be on ready-alert one just in case something comes up.
Now I can get some real work done.
You know, I think I'm just gonna hang out here with you guys, if that's cool.
It's not.
Great.
I could leave.
I could.
But I'm not going to.
I will get my one minute of small talk, damn it.
And it will be casual, and it will be amicable!
Did Leslie leave?
We wanted her to sign the gotcha wall.
Joanie.
Come on, now.
What was that?
I thought we were gonna get that sticker.
Sorry, Tom.
But I am, first and foremost, a journalist.
Let us take you to lunch.
Okay?
We'll talk about the book.
And Whatever else may come up.
Let me go change into something more tantalizing.
All right?
So, what?
We're taking her to lunch now?
Ben, Leslie hired my company to get her that sticker.
You're the one that told me "businesses" need "clients" to get "money".
I was the first one to tell you that?
Don't worry.
This is in the bag.
Joan's a married woman.
She wants what she can't have.
It's a game of cat and mouse.
Thank you all for coming.
Our journey begins on page one, the preface.
Oh, boy.
Yes?
I think I speak on behalf of everyone in the entire world when I say We need to know the truth about where you were born.
- Okay.
Well-- - Leslie?
Let me handle this.
Does it really matter?
I mean, how many of you were actually born in Pawnee?
Sure enough.
No matter what you heard, ma'am, the truth is, I was born here.
If you were so born here, then where's your birth certificate?
Well, I don't carry my birth certificate around - with me-- - Why?
Because you're hiding something?
You should go back where you came from.
I am back from where I came from!
That sentence was confusing!
You might as well be from China!
Tell us!
- That's ridiculous!
- Is it?
I'm from here!
This crowd getting very hostile, Ms. Knope.
I'm gonna get you outta here.
- Oh, my God.
- Back off!
Okay, okay.
Thank you.
Go, go, go!
When I was 18, Val Kilmer saw me at a mall and told me I should model.
That never happened.
So, Joan, how is married life treating you?
Your husband still know he's the luckiest man in the world?
Santino and I are divorcing.
Oh.
It's actually quite liberating.
I'm a woman with a strong sexual appetite.
I'm like a caged peacock, yearning for the wind on her haunches.
That's a powerful metaphor.
Maybe we can get that book club sticker in order, and we can work on unlockin' that peacock cage.
Things have changed, Tom.
Don't make any promises you can't keep.
I'll have another drink, and so will this adorable hunk of caramel to my right.
Drink up, Tom.
I'm gonna go powder my nose Amongst other things.
If you know what I mean.
Crap.
Is she gonna powder her vagina?
- You gotta help me, man.
- Why?
Seems to be going the usual amount of gross.
No, this is way different.
She's not married anymore.
She had, like, five bottles of alcohol, she's callin' me "caramel".
You've gotta throw some cold water on this situation.
Start talkin' about nerd stuff.
You know, nerd culture is mainstream now.
So when you use the word "nerd" derogatorily, means you'the one that's out of the zeitgeist.
Yes, that's perfect.
Just like that.
Be incredibly boring.
Well, I've made a little progress.
I'm up to four seconds with April.
Hey, April.
I was looking to get some new music, and I was wondering if you could recommend anything.
The Internet.
I really like your haircut.
- W-w-where'd you get it?
- Prison.
How's your sister doin'?
She has the shingles.
Who's your favorite character on Sex and the City?
Alf.
And Nine seconds with Ron.
You're stranded on a desert island.
What is the one thing that you bring with you?
Silence.
We did a flash poll.
now believe you're lying about where you were born.
Honesty is important to voters.
What?
Why?
Whatever, I can end this now.
Here's my birth certificate.
Mm-hmm.
Well, this just says "Wamapoke County".
Yeah.
That's the county Pawnee is in.
Well, no.
This won't do it.
See, you staked your reputation on this.
So you need to go down to the county records office in Eagleton and get the original, long-form certificate.
Oh, God.
Don't make me go to Eagleton.
Eagleton is the land of rich, snobby jerks.
There's a whole chapter about it in my book.
I could write a second book about Eagleton and how stupid it is.
And I'd call it Eagleton: The land of rich, snobby jerks.
Hello and welcome to the Wamapoke County Records Office, here in beautiful Eagleton.
My name is Alexis Pratchett.
Take it down a notch, Alexis.
I need a copy of my birth certificate.
Ooh, I'm sorry.
It takes three to eight weeks to receive a birth certificate.
Really?
Hi, I'm Chris.
I was wondering if you might make an exception for me?
Oh, I'm sorry.
No.
Wow.
That usually works.
Oh, God.
I hate this stupid town with all its stupid, terrible people.
I need that birth certificate.
Leslie, wait here.
Bert Macklin is on the case.
- Andy-- - No.
Don't worry.
I can do this.
Believe in me!
That's broken.
Hold on.
Leslie.
Real quick.
Uh, spell your last name for me.
Let's hear it for the boys Whoo!
Wow.
That was as long as it was loud.
Take me home, dumpling.
It's beddy time.
Ah.
Hey, Ben.
You like Star Trek.
Talk about that for a little bit.
They're making a sequel I'm assuming with the same alternate timeline.
But if J.J. Abrams and company expect us to believe that it's Spock with the romantic tension with Uhura and not Kirk Well, let's just say, the message boards are goin' nuts.
I wanna take you both home and  bend you over and just .
at the same time.
Whoo!
I'm leaving.
Wait, wait, wait.
We gotta get her home.
Tom, I know your business is failing, but this just isn't worth it.
It's not about the business anymore, man.
Sh-she's a disaster.
We gotta make sure she gets home safe.
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa.
What the hell?
Okay, let's get her on the bed.
- Okay.
One.
- Oh, my God.
Two.
Three.
Let's go, bro.
Say what you will about Joan, but she knows how to decorate a bedroom.
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.
Where the hell am I?
I just wanna see how soft these sheets are.
One second.
Tom, no.
Come on.
Let's go.
Ah!
Joan, we left you some water and aspirin by the bed!
Bye!
Got it!
Got it!
Nice!
I also got this dude's briefcase.
It was just layin' there.
Kind of a panic move.
I believed in you, buddy.
But you should put that back.
Okay.
Okay, so.
Leslie Barbara Knope, born January 18th, to Robert and Marlene Knope, in Eagleton, Indiana.
I'm from Eagleton!
Is it true mom?
Was I born in Eagleton?
Yes, it's true.
No!
Pawnee hospital was overrun with raccoons at the time.
So we had to go to the next closest hospital.
I'm sorry.
Did you expect me to give birth to you in an infested, disease-filled room?
Mom, why didn't you tell me?
You try telling that little girl she's not from Pawnee.
I certainly couldn't.
So you were technically born in Eagleton.
Who cares?
I care.
The people of Pawnee care.
I wrote on the cover of my book that I was born in Pawnee.
I went on Pawnee today, and I called Joan a liar!
I'm the liar.
I'm worse than a liar.
I'm an Eagletonian.
Morning.
Is Leslie here?
Aw, man.
I am so tired.
I took a half-shift at the hospital last night.
And I had this really weird patient.
Weird how?
I probably shouldn't talk about it.
It's one of the grossest things I've ever seen.
Talk.
Well, this guy came in.
He got his hand stuck in a Pringles can, and he tried to cut himself out.
- Was there a lot of blood?
- What kind of blade did he use?
Uh, three-and-a-half-inch?
Serrated?
Buckets of blood.
He passed out over his arm, and slumped onto the floor.
Did the bone show?
Very good question, April.
Answer her.
Yeah.
The bone showed.
Everyone in the universe loves a gross medical story.
Boom!
I win!
And so when I finally cleaned up the vomit, I found the toe.
I forgot about the toe!
So did we!
Crazy, right?
That story's awesome!
Indeed.
Thank you for sharing, Jenny.
Ann was getting a little chummy.
When people get too chummy with me, I like to call them by the wrong name to let them know I don't really care about them.
That's a genius move.
Thank you.
You're welcome, Lester.
Oh, my God.
I wonder who else was born in Eagleton.
Voldemort, probably.
Bad news, team.
Entertainment 720 was unable to get the sticker for Leslie's book.
The sticker is the least of my problems.
If I come clean about where I'm from, then my political career is over.
You don't have to tell them a damn thing.
The only thing the voters need to know about you is your name.
And even that, I go back and forth on.
I'm sorry, but I disagree.
Leslie, where you were born is a piece of trivia.
Where you're from That's what makes you who you are.
And you are from Pawnee.
You're more Pawnee than anyone I know.
So I say, tell them the truth, and trust that they're gonna respect you for it.
Damn it, he's right.
Well said.
Thanks, Ron.
You're welcome, Steve.
Joan.
Thanks so much for havin' Leslie back on the program.
Well, thank you for getting me home last night.
I wasn't, uh, feeling very well.
Because of some bad seafood that I ate.
Yes, that's probably what it was.
I'd like to apologize to those that I've misled.
I thought I was telling the truth, but, sadly, I was born in Eagleton.
Wha--?
Well, that is worse than I ever could have hoped for.
I learned something, Joan.
It's not where you're born.
It's where you're from.
When I was nine years old, I broke my arm.
Sledding on that giant hill behind Kernston's rubber nipple factory.
- You know, "nipple hill".
- Of course.
- It gets very slippery there.
- I know that.
- Especially when it's wet.
- Yes.
And, Jim.
Jim Kabernick.
I know Jim.
Jim and I have gone to school together since we were, like, three years old.
Yes, that's true.
Do you remember when you peed your pants in second grade?
Why--why did you bring that up?
I said yes.
You stuck your underwear in your drawer, and you got really embarrassed, and then the teacher came over and pulled them out.
And everybody called you "the gerbil" because you always smelled like soiled wood chips?
Leslie, for God's sake, we're on TV.
The point is you can't choose where you were born.
But you can choose where you live.
I love this town.
I always have.
I always will.
And that's why I wrote a book about it.
And that's why I'm running for City Council.
Look, I'm not crazy.
I know Pawnee isn't Paris, or London, or Chicago.
But it's a great place to live.
And work.
And serving the goofballs in this town is an honor and a privilege.
And, yes, every town claims its diner's waffles are the best in the world, but somewhere, in some town, there really are the best waffles in the world.
So delicious, and rich, and golden brown that anyone who tasted them would decide never to leave that town.
Somewhere, those waffles exist.
Why can't it be here?
Joan put us in her book club.
Although I could do without this.
Leslie?
Here's the thing.
I've been all over the State.
Indianapolis, Bloomington, Lafayette, Muncie, Gary All the places you mention in the book.
And I interviewed all the people you mentioned.
And so far, there is not one incorrect fact.
So now I'm going to head to the house, say hey to Gayle, wish my daughter a happy belated birthday It was yesterday And then I'm gonna head back out and hit all the towns in the southeast.
But is there anything I should know?
Any new info?
No.
You're doin' great.
Godspeed.
- Doin' what I can.
- Yep!
Hey, Ron.
Gotta go, Donna.
Can't talk.
He just seemed so happy.
I didn't say anything.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Gentlemen.
Wildeness weekend is upon us.
There will be no video games.
There will be no Internet pads.
This weekend you have two parents: Me and Mother Nature.
And I am Mother Nature's brother: Brother nature.
But you can call me Andy.
Or brother nature.
Your call.
- Thank you, Andy.
- Brother nature.
For the last three years I have served as troop leader of the Pawnee Rangers.
This is our handbook.
I wrote the whole thing myself.
Okay, it's time to give out the badges.
Um, let's see.
Emily, you get the badge for most community service.
To Casey, the best penguin blog badge.
To Abigail, flyest hairstyle.
And Ann gets the badge for second-flyest hairstyle.
Oh!
I wasn't competing for that.
I'll say.
Five years ago, a plucky fifth-grader wanted to join the Pawnee Rangers, but their executive council said what obnoxious jerks always say.
"No.
This is males-only.
Go start your own club".
She couldn't.
So I did.
We're called the Pawnee Goddesses, and we're freakin' awesome.
Hey, Ron, whose club do you think is better, yours or mine?
The answer is mine.
Say mine is better.
It's not a competition.
Oh, but it is.
Your club made it a competition when they kept girls out.
Oh, my stars.
I'm just a little lady.
My fragile constitution cannot handle the fearsome outdoors.
I have no problem with strong women, Leslie.
Who's Leslie?
My name is Annabelle Vandergraf, and, y'all, I just fall to pieces when the sun shines on my hair--ed.
However, the Pawnee Rangers were founded because some boys want to go out into nature and learn traditional survival skills without being distracted by girls.
Well, my awesome goddesses don't want to be distracted by losers.
Say my club is better, Ron.
Say it.
My club is better.
Say it.
Come on.
Say it's better.
Say it.
Say it's better.
Say my club is better.
Say it.
Give it up.
Whose club is better?
Mine.
Say it.
You know it.
Say it.
On principal, I never say anything that another person is obviously trying to get me to say.
My first wedding ceremony took two hours, because after the priest said "Repeat after me" I fell silent.
I've been auditing the budget, and I noticed you're way behind on your paperwork.
Uh, Jerry, you haven't filled out a PC-10 form in two and a half years.
Aw, jeez, I'm sorry.
Yeah, we kinda do our paperwork at our own speed.
Oh, really?
Well, I kinda need you to do it at my speed.
Fine, I'll do them.
What is wrong with you today?
Did they cancel Game of Thrones?
Nothing is wrong, just do your job.
And they would never cancel Game of Thrones.
It's a crossover hit.
It's not just for fantasy enthusiasts.
They're telling human stories in a fantasy world.
Fill out the forms, please.
Thank you.
I used to have one really good reason for staying in Pawnee.
But now, I'm not sure what's keeping me here.
Although, I am just two sandwiches away from a free meatball sub.
This is expired.
Rangers, as a reward for coming on this trip, I have gotten you each two gifts.
Go ahead.
Open 'em.
What is this?
That is a canvas sheet, the most versatile object known to man.
It can be used to make tents, backpacks, shoes, stretchers, sails, tarpaulins, and I suppose, in the most dire of circumstances, it can be a surface on which to make "art".
What's the second gift?
The second gift is the box itself.
You have 10 minutes to assemble a shelter using only your two gifts.
Go.
Ladies!
The goddess cabin has never looked better.
This year's cabin refurbishment badge is going to be hotly contested.
Okay, so what did everybody make for their loosely structured craft time?
Lauren?
I made a "Gertrude Stein".
Amazing.
Lauren, that's so good!
I really wouldn't want to follow that.
Ann?
Oh, boy.
Um I was making some cornhusk dolls for everyone but they kinda turned out wrong so they look like monsters.
I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna put that over there.
In the fire.
Well, Ann's keeping us warm.
And that's important.
April?
What was your craft?
.
I drew something on my arm.
It's a pioneer girl watching her grandmother get trampled by a buffalo.
Yeah.
This right here's all the blood coming out her face.
DJ Bluntz is in the building, here to announce that Tom Haverford is in the building.
Oh!
1-2, 1-2!
Donatella.
T-mobile.
Three words for you: Treat.
Yo.
Self.
Both: Treat yourself 2011.
Once a year, Donna and I spend a day treating ourselves.
What do we treat ourselves to?
- Clothes.
- Treat yourself.
- Fragrances.
- Treat yourself.
- Massages.
- Treat yourself.
- Mimosas.
- Treat yourself.
- Fine leather goods.
- Treat yourself!
It's the best day of the year.
Both: The best day of the year .
I got a question.
Mm-hmm?
What do you think about inviting Ben to come along with us today?
What?
Noo!
This is our thing.
But he really seems like he could use a day off.
He's like a skinny little rubber band that's about to snap in half.
Exactly.
He doesn't know how to relax.
Donna, you and I are relaxation professionals.
There's no way Ben can slow down enough to keep up with us.
My Nubian princess, this is our holy day.
It's the one day a year I allow myself to be selfish.
Ooh, cupcakes.
Those are all for me, Jerry.
This homemade bulgogi is so delicious, Kayla.
This is the best Korean food I've ever had.
I would say it's almost as good as lukewarm beans from a can.
Right, Ron?
I'm trying to teach my boys about rationing food, and your self-indulgent ethnic food court isn't helping.
Goddesses, let's go over our schedule for this afternoon.
We have hiking, and then capture the flag, and then a puppet show about the Bill of Rights set to "Party in the USA" by Miley Cyrus, and then we have lasso training, and a s'mores-off.
So what's on our schedule, Mr. Swanson?
We have one activity planned: Not getting killed.
Jerry.
Oh, everybody must be at Rangers weekend.
You know, I actually was a ranger for 12 years-- That's wonderful.
Maybe you should take the day off.
You know, rest is very important.
Did you know that lab rats who are deprived of rest grow tumors all over their bodies?
You should Google it.
It's horrifying.
Uh, thank you.
Yes.
You know, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go have lunch with my daughter!
You know, Chris, if you wanted, you know, you should join us for lunch.
My daughter, she's really sweet.
I would love to, Jerry, but I'm afraid that I am busy.
I have got to run.
Google those rat tumors!
Both: Treat yourself 2011 Oh, lord.
Is he eating soup?
On a bench?
Alone?
Tom.
Fine.
Come on, rubber band.
Come with us.
What?
What are you-- No arguing.
And no soup in the Benz.
- Get in.
- Wha?
What?
What is happening right now?
Great pillow fight, girls.
That was one of our best ones yet.
Okay.
Now it's time for awards.
Lulu gets the golden pillow.
And the silver pillow goes to Janie.
Ooh!
Yes, what is it?
Ms. Knope, I don't like the Rangers anymore.
I want to become a Pawnee Goddess.
I did it!
My club is officially the best club.
I would give myself a merit badge that says "Best Club Founder," but I don't have one, so I'm going to give myself "Prettiest eyes" as a placeholder.
I secretly always wanted this badge, so it works out great.
You were defecting?
I like you, Mr. Swanson, it's just All we do is sit in silence and eat beans.
Those beans were a reward.
Well, see, the thing is this club is for girls only.
Maybe you should start your own club, for boys.
Get back to your canvas box.
We'll discuss this no further.
And I'll thank you to keep the ruckus down so my boys can focus on solitude.
- I'm sorry, Darren.
- Let's go.
So, treat yourself day is just a day where you go to the spa and then the mall?
I knew you wouldn't get it.
Well, I'm a relaxation novice.
Give me some guidance.
Listen to me, Ben-to box, the point of this is to pamper yourself.
Just relaaax, man.
I can't.
Something about the sound of harps that makes me nervous.
Oh, my God!
- Hi, Donna.
- Hey.
Relaxation lesson number one: Acupuncture.
It's great for your back, and your rear.
Needles in your face, pleasure in your base.
-  I know.
- That's my boss.
Hey, Chris.
Uh, I would like you to meet my daughter, Millicent.
Wow.
Jerry, great job.
I'm your dad's boss.
And his much-younger friend.
Pleasure to meet you.
Isn't she beautiful?
I say she looks like my wife, Gayle, and Gayle agrees.
So, anyway, we were gonna go to lunch, so-- I retroactively accept your original offer.
Let's go!
Ladies, I just wanted to thank you for not cheering when I sent Darren away.
Ms. Knope, wasn't Darren just asking for the same equality that you and the goddesses wanted five years ago?
In a sense, but it's a little bit more complicated than-- Wasn't your answer the very same thing that the ranger council said to you?
"Stick to your own kind"?
Who wants homemade peanut brittle?
Ms. Perkins, please, we're in the middle of a debate.
Sorry.
Come on, goddesses.
We just struck a huge blow for equality by proving that we were better than them.
I disagree.
What about a public forum?
You always say that there's no better solution for a hot-button issue than a good ol'-fashioned public forum.
Great idea, Lauren.
What was that?
I said, "great idea, Lauren".
I've taught them too well.
I've created a mob of little Leslie Knope monsters.
I'm so proud.
And a little annoyed.
But mostly proud.
Just relax and don't move.
Okay.
Ah This is the most stressed-out I've ever been in my life.
Ben, listen.
I'm gonna talk to you about things you like to take your mind off the needles, okay?
Accounting.
Trigonometry.
Stamps, probably.
More of a rare coins guy.
Help me.
Help me!
There is nothing that I like more than running for charity.
You know, last summer I did a 50-mile bike ride - for the red cross.
- Yes, she did.
Millicent Gergich, biking for charity is literally one of my interests on Facebook.
I can't believe how alike we are.
I know, it's like we're literally the same person.
We are having a moment.
Attention, everyone.
Welcome to wonder weekend's first-ever public forum.
Our topic today?
Should the amazing goddesses take pity on the once-powerful Pawnee Rangers, and let them into our clearly superior organization?
Ron, your opening statement.
This forum, like all public forums, is a waste of time.
Thank you.
Powerful stuff.
Okay.
Let's open up the floor to debate.
Who-- yes, Abigail.
Isn't it like Brown vs.
The Board of Education?
Separate but equal is never really equal.
We should let the boys in.
Mmm, interesting.
Casey?
I disagree.
I think there's a benefit to educating the genders separately.
I see where you're coming from.
Let's hear from a ranger.
Anyone?
Darren?
It's cold and dirty out here.
And you guys have candy.
I want the candy.
The goddesses are making some well-informed statements, but the most compelling point is from Darren, about the candy.
We have amazing candy in there.
Welcome to Nirvana, the Plaza at Eagleton.
There's a reflecting pool out back, there's an old-timey train that runs through the mall, and three Burberrys.
If you tell your friend, "hey, meet me at Burberry," they gotta specify which one.
Let's hit it.
I really want this dress, and I like this crystal beetle, but it's expensive and there's no use for it.
Donna Meagle?
Treat yourself.
Velvet slippies, cashmere socks, velvet pants, cashmere turtle.
I'm a cashmere-velvet candy cane.
Treat yourself.
I mean, this is insane.
Jerry, a word?
Of course.
I had an amazing lunch.
I've already passed the kale salad I had.
But, even better?
Your daughter was delightful company.
Now, I don't want to put you in an awkward position, but-- You would like to date my daughter.
Yes!
But you are her father.
And that is a sacred thing.
I would like to spend the next 2 to 4 days with you so you can get to know me better, to find out if I'm the kind of person who's good enough for your daughter.
Then, you can come with us on our first 3 to 6 dates-- Chris, I appreciate the gesture, it's very nice, but, Milly, she's a grown woman, and of course I trust her.
And I trust you.
Jerry.
Thank you.
Mmm.
Boys, I'm trying to teach you something about nature and self-reliance.
Nothing beats hard work and determination.
Is this the Pawnee goddesses?
I've got the puppies you ordered.
Oh!
The puppies for the puppy party that we're having in our cabin?
Those puppies?
What?
Noo!
Man, did you buy anything for yourself today?
Yeah, I got this pack of socks.
Plain white socks?
That's not a treat!
Donna!
Get me away from him.
Look.
Maybe this is our version of treat yourself day and he needs to do his version.
What are you talking about?
Wyatt, if you could blow big money on one thing-- not sock money-- what would it be?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
This is a whole new level of nerd.
You're right.
This is ridiculous.
What am I doing?
Wait.
No, no, no, no.
I mean that in a good way, Ben.
Listen to me, you're part of the treat yourself team now, okay?
If that costume somehow makes you happy, you're gonna buy it.
And you're gonna wear it out of the store, okay?
You're gonna treat yourself.
Yeah, you know what?
I'm gonna do that.
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna treat myself.
Thanks, you guys.
Thank you.
I really needed this.
I'm gonna treat myself.
Uh-oh.
Batman's crying.
I am a goddess.
A glorious female warrior.
All: I am a goddess.
A glorious female warrior.
Queen of all that I survey.
All: Queen of all that I survey.
Enemies of fairness and equality, hear my womanly roar.
All: Enemies of fairness and equality, hear my womanly roar.
Congratulations, you are now goddesses.
Oh, my God!
Now, have yourselves a puppy party.
Oh, boy.
Hey.
Can I sit down?
Look, I didn't mean for this to happen.
I have a lot of respect for the Pawnee Rangers, even if they were jerks five years ago.
You're not a jerk.
You're a good troop leader.
Not for these times I'm not.
It's taken me a while to see this, but these kids I don't understand 'em.
And they certainly don't understand me.
That's not true.
No, it is.
And it's okay.
People change.
Their interests change.
It's the way of the world.
When did kids get so interested in fun?
Ah I'm gonna turn in.
You were right, by the way.
Your group is better.
What's wrong?
Out with it.
I was seeing a woman, uh, for a while, and then we stopped seeing each other.
Uh, pretty recently.
That's why you've been off your game.
Sorry, dog.
You're a catch, Wyatt.
You're gonna be okay.
There's chickenheads everywhere, Ben.
Chickenheads all around this mall.
You're gonna find one, and you're gonna be great.
But, for now, why don't you let it out?
Treat yourself to a good cry.
One question, though.
Yeah?
Why so serious?
Wait, I got something.
Oh!
Cool!
Awesome!
Nice!
Thanks, D-money.
What kind of bait did you use?
I bought this mackerel at the supermarket.
I've been standing in the water with the fish on my hook for 30 minutes.
I saw it on an episode I Love Lucy.
Pathetic?
Maybe.
But, feels pretty good to have a bunch of little boys be super into me.
That came out wrong.
Ron!
Come fish with us!
That's okay.
Seems like you have things under control.
Come on!
Come do that thing where you catch one with your hands!
I've seen him do it, it's incredible.
Ron, come on!
We need you to help us have fun!
First annual Leslie Knope remote control speedboat race!
See ya Monday.
Jerry.
Where did you come from?
Listen, as I said earlier, I want keep everything above board in regards to my relationship with your daughter.
And, as you know, Millicent and I went out last night.
And it went terrific.
Chris, that's great, but you really don't have to do this.
Again, the date was amazing, we had sparkling conversation, and, full disclosure, she did spend the night at my house.
Have a great day, Jerry.
What are you doing here?
We're here for the club.
That was last week.
The ad says today.
Ad?
"Are you tough as nails?
" Would you rather sleep on a bed of pine needles "than a mattress?
"Do you find video games pointless "and shopping malls stupid?
"Do you march to the beat of your own drummer?
"Did you make the drum yourself?
"If so, you might just have what it takes to be "a Swanson.
"Pawnee's most hardcore outdoor club starts today.
Boys and girls welcome".
Swansons!
Are you prepared for whatever lies ahead?
All: Yes, sir.
Before we proceed, do any of have any dietary restrictions?
Correct, you do not.
First outing is right now.
I will be teaching you to dig a proper trench.
Does that sound like something you want to do?
All: Yes, sir.
This will be no fun at all.
The Town of Pawnee invites you to stay tuned for more Parks & Rec.
And to try our delicious local corn.
The Internet's not working.
Ben!
We need your help.
Guys, I've told you how to do it.
You just unplug the router and then you plug it back in again.
Guess I'll do it.
Still not working.
Well, give it a minute.
God.
Okay, it's working.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Hmm.
Eyeballs wrapped, uhm vampire teeth Boom!
Vampire teeth.
Good.
Spider webs.
- Done.
- Mm-hm.
Fake blood capsules.
Oh, they didn't have any.
Really?
That's gross, I love it.
We are throwing a Halloween party at our house.
It's gonna be the greatest thing ever.
Someone will die.
Of fun!
And of murder.
And there's gonna be beer, pumpkins Bloody goblins.
Fake ones.
It's gonna be awesome.
We have decorations Dead people that we just murdered.
Not murdered.
But pictures of dead people from TV or movies.
Mutilated bodies.
B-but fake ones.
Candy, dancing, Tequila.
All kinds of food and snacks.
Blood orphans.
No blood orphans.
II don't know what that is.
I want you on message, and the message is Leslie Knope.
If you're not talking about you, you're talking about the wrong thing.
I hate talking about myself.
Get over it.
I talk about myself constantly.
Everyone loves me for it.
I really am amazing.
When you work in government, people often suspect that you're anti-business.
So I'm throwing a little meet-and-greet with business owners, and I've asked Tom's company to help.
Here's my opening line: "Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, and I'm in the business of being city councilor".
- Oh, my God.
- I'm not going to use that.
This is your primary target.
President of the chamber of commerce, Martin Kernston.
Oh, yes, from Kernston Rubber Nipples.
"The nipple king".
Photos, BIOS, likes, dislikes, prescription medications.
I've heard of Martin Kernston.
- I know a little bit about him.
- Oh, really?
Well, which of his advisors does he trust more, Ted Flirtman or Rex Spax?
Well, it depends, Flirtman is more of a confidant-- I made up both those names.
Okay, I'm on it.
Get at me.
Jean-Ralphio, stop crying.
What?
Hold on, slow down.
Hold on-- Allergic to chestnuts.
And good haircuts.
It's too tight, looser.
No, I feel like we need to inflate it more.
No, I told you, I'm a sumo wrestler after he lost the weight.
I take it we're having a party.
Dude!
I knew there was sometngng I forgot to tell you.
Sorry.
No, no, no, it's fine.
Why should you guys tell me you're gonna have an enormous party?
I-I didn't tell you I was gonna be quietly working in my room.
- That's a good point.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I guess we're even.
If you need me, I'll--I'll definitely be awake.
Because I-I won't be able to sleep.
Because of the party.
You know?
So All right.
My family is very non-confrontational.
My parents' method of problem-solving is to kind of keep everything bottled up and just subtly hint at what's bothering them.
And after 36 years, they are still divorced.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tom, this is not what I pictured at all.
This looks like a party for Entertainment 720.
Is Entertainment 720 running for office?
It's a small business.
You're trying to show people you have a good relationship with small businesses.
Now the party, that's all about you, Boo.
Okay, then shouldn't my face be on these rugs?
I'm sorry, no.
It's always been a dream of mine to be a rug.
And it's finally happened.
Tom, now is not a time for you to explore your weird dreams.
Okay?
I want all of this gone, all of it.
Except that cake.
Keep tha tcake here.
Just scrape off the words.
Donna?
Blue shirt Badge Nightstick.
You are a policewoman.
Yup.
- You're a regular-- - Sherlock Holmes.
I solved that mystery before you did.
Okay, this was fun.
Andy!
You are UFC legend Chuck Liddell.
That's right.
Girl from The Ring.
To me, Sherlock Holmes is literally the greatest character in the Western canon.
Smart, intuitive, handsome.
Replace his pasty British frailty with superhuman physical fitness, and you get Sherlock Traeger.
Mister Potato head.
That's right.
Hey, where's my lovely daughter tonight?
She's at home.
I knew that you would be here.
And I was worried that you might be concerned, seeing us together at night.
You're a very thoughtful guy.
But really, I have no problem with the two of you dating.
R-really, I mean, look at you.
You're just, you know, beautiful.
You're beautiful.
On the inside where your spirit lives.
Listen, tell her come to the party and I don't mind at all.
Oh, good, I'll text her.
Okay, you can text without looking at your phone?
I think it's rude not to maintain eye contact with people that I'm talking to.
That's from me.
Wow!
I--th-that's amazing.
- High five.
- Wow.
Hey, Ron.
Good to see you.
Weren't you a pirate last year?
Yes.
This is my Halloween costume.
Andrew, are you aware that your bathroom faucet is leaking?
Are you kidding me?
I just stuffed a sock in it yesterday.
What else do they want me to do?
There's an exposed wire above the bathtub as well.
Oh, yeah, shockwire!
I call it that 'cause if you take a shower and you touch the wire.
You die!
Yes, that is accurate.
Do you have a toolbox?
Yeah.
No home is complete without a proper toolbox.
Here's April and Andy's.
A hammer.
Half of a pretzel.
Baseball card.
Some cartridge that says "Sonic" and "Hedgehog".
A scissor half.
And a flashlight Filled with jellybeans.
Although I've not worked with you professionally, as a private citizen, I have personally patronized each and every one of your establishments.
Mm, I've never seen you buy a salad at Sue's Salads.
That's 'cause I don't hate myself, Tanya.
I'm sorry.
I know I should be chasing your vote, but I stand behind my decision to avoid salad and other disgusting things.
And I think I have a lot of support in the community for that.
Despite the fact that this seems like a party for Tom's face, uh, I think it's going pretty well.
When in doubt, in Pawnee, slam salad.
I'm just especially thankful that you could come, Mr. President.
- Martin.
- Martin.
You were responsible for the Harvest Festival, right?
No.
Yes.
Well It was a team effort.
I barely did anything.
I held them back actually.
They succeeded despite me.
I'm sorry.
I worked very hard on that event.
I'm just..
Bureaucrats s aren't used to bragging about themselves.
Tom, come over here and talk about how great I am.
Martin Tom M Veverfor I threw this shindig Tom, tell Martin how hard I worked on the Harvest Festival.
It was incredible.
A lot of people say the Harvest Festival is what launched Entertainment 720.
- No one says that.
- I just said it.
My company, Entertainment 720, has an amazing business opportunity for Kernston's.
Mind if I steal you away for a few seconds?
Give you the 'tails?
The 'tails?
The details.
Most people would probably say "the deets".
I say "the 'tails".
Just one example of innovation.
Look, I don't like to throw around the word "butthead" too often.
If you call everybody a butthead, then it kind of loses its impact.
But I can say without hesitation that Tom is being a real dick.
Hey!
You stole the nipple king.
Thanks a lot, traitor.
I'm sorry, I just needed to ask him about this one thing, but we're all good now.
Wh-what if I just introduce you for your speech?
I have a better idea.
Why don't you go over to one of your rugs and sit on your own face?
I don't need your "help" anymore.
Hi there.
Is there a project you're working on?
I know more than you.
All right.
When April and Andy married, I didn't get them a wedding present.
In my experience, wedding presents are nothing more than kindling on a divorce bonfire.
But I think I found a way I can really help them make a home.
You, beanbag, come with me.
I'm an eggplant.
I don't care.
Come with me.
- Why?
- I need small hands.
I'm scared.
Look who decided to join the party, bro!
That's awesome!
Where's your costume?
Honey, he's wearing a costume.
He's going as lame.
That's a pretty good costume actually.
But, uh, I think the Batman costume's way better.
You should go wear that.
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna put on a costume because I'm not really attending this party That's at my house.
Hey, listen, if you're mad about something, - you should just-- - No, I'm not.
I'm not mad.
Really?
Listen, I feel like you are mad.
So maybe you should just talk to us about it.
My name's Ben.
I'm mad.
All right, that was great, - Thank you.
Thanks for that.
- Soft, soft lips.
Your fingers are salty.
I'm gonna finish my work-- Oren, no!
No.
Stay out.
Pawnee has suffered through a tough economy.
And what has kept our town alive is you, the small businessman.
And I'm not referring to your stature, Gary.
You are a giant in this community.
So many business represented here today.
Food and Stuff, JJ's Diner, Glenmore Discount Cemetery, uh, Tramp Stamp Tattoos, Enormous Kenny's Fried Dough Stand and Mobile Phone Emporium.
Who else?
Sue's Salads.
Smooth Operator Bikini Waxes.
Jeff's Savings and Loan And Entertainment 720.
Thank you so much for that amazing intro, Leslie.
Hi, folks.
My name is Tom Haverford, and I'm here to tell you a little bit about Pawnee's premiere entertainment and multimedia conglomerate, Entertainment 720 where dreams come, they come true How about we watch this brief promotional film?
What?
Entertainment 720 has been a fixture of this community since June.
Tom, listen to me.
Turn that off or give me the remote right now.
Can we let it play please?
You're lucky that Martin Kernston is here because you're gonna need another nipple.
There.
I think I got it.
Yep, you got it.
Can you at least tell me what you're doing?
I'm a homeowner.
I would like to actually learn something.
Yeah.
I'm tightening the valve stem into the valve shank.
I'm replacing the handle.
And then tightening the set screw, which will hold it in place.
Now Oh, my God!
We made it work.
It's a good feeling.
A sense of accomplishment and pride.
Damn it, I just love it so much.
Are you okay?
Great.
I'm gonna go around this house and fix everything I can find that needs fixing.
You wanna help?
I really do.
Good.
That's next.
I can't reveal my identity because of various corporate enemies, but suffice it to say, I run a fairly popular social networking site.
And let's face it, booking e720 was the smartest decision I ever made.
I hope you liked this story.
I invented Facebook.
Wow.
Okay, um I know that video seemed like the rantings of a lunatic pretending to be Mark zuckerberg-- - That's who that was?
- No.
That is impressive.
Uh, we're not gonna waste any more of your time.
Agreed.
Let's get right to it.
Please welcome the e720 mailing list divas!
I want all of y'all to write down the name and direct phone line for whoever's in charge of hiring independent contractors for your business!
Now come join me and let's all take a dip in the e720 mobile hot tub!
It's parked right outside.
Le'go.
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey.
Thought you weren't coming to the party.
Well, I'm just having a butterfinger.
Oh, really?
Is that okay?
No.
You're not part of the party, you can't have the candy.
- Back up.
- All right.
- Back up.
- Okay.
I have one sister.
We steal each other's stuff, hack each other's Twitter accounts, set each other's clothes on fire.
There are no rules.
We need to deal with what's bothering you.
Oh, please, come into my room.
See?
You're angry at me and you're not talking about it.
And I'm gonna beat you up until you do, because I'm mature.
What are you-- Stop it.
I grew up with five brothers and we fought.
Using the Dwyer method, which was yelling, wrestling, crying, followed by lots of hugs.
And then more wrestling, but the fun kind, and then crying when the fun kind of wrestling got out of hand.
Um, can you let me go?
Not 'til you tell me what's wrong.
Um, Mr. President.
I just want to apologize for the actions of that little weasel.
Leslie, I'm a frugal man.
I don't like extravagance or showmanship.
That's why I cut my own hair.
And it's what's made me a successful businessman.
So if Entertainment 720 is the kind of business you trust, I'm afraid you and I don't share the same values.
There you are, you little bastard.
Get out of there right now.
Leslie, can you do me a favor and just let me sit here?
Tom, get out of your stupid limousine hot tub right now, or we are no longer friends.
I'm not getting out.
Fine, then I'm getting in.
Listen to me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, get away from me.
You know what you are?
You're a selfish little punk, okay?
Just because you want something doesn't mean that everybody has to bow to-- listen to me!
You didn't even let me have my one night.
Look at me!
I don't want to see your face.
Look at me.
I don't want to see your face!
I've been looking at your face all night.
God!
I'm sorry.
What's wrong with you?
My company's bankrupt.
Okay?
Entertainment 720 is dead.
Oh, man.
Excuse us.
Nice form, son.
Make sure you keep a firm pressure on the cranium.
On the cranium?
Listen up!
I have to turn off the power for one minute.
We're gonna go dark, people.
Bear with us, okay?
We gotta switch off the main fuse hose.
It's just a fuse.
It's just a fusePeople.
Just a fuse.
Well, maybe we should get out of this hot tub.
I'm too sad to get out.
And I'm all pruney.
What happened?
I don't know.
I guess I just didn't moisturize enough this morning, and I've been laying around-- With the company, Tom.
We're hemorrhaging cash ever since we opened.
They say you've got to spend money to make money.
Well, I don't know where we went wrong.
We spent all of our money.
Okay.
You know what you need?
Some good old-fashioned comfort food.
Where are we gonna get Albacore tuna with crispy onions at this hour?
Come on.
Looks like you've got the handle on that torque wrench.
Yeah, well, the flange was a little warped.
So I just goosed it with a triple three bolt smack.
That was nonsense.
I know, but it's so fun to talk like that.
You know what?
Keep this.
You earned it.
Thanks, Ron.
I need to get more dip.
Great.
I'm going.
- Come on, walk.
- No.
This is a pacifist protest.
Had enough?
You need to let go of me.
Yeah, get it.
That's good.
There we go.
- Let go of me.
- He's got his back.
Come on, fight me.
- No!
- Noooo.
Nice!
Yeah!
Oh, my God, Andy, I am so sorry.
Psych!
Blood capsules.
- What?
- Yeah!
I wanted to shock you into expressing your anger.
And that way-- !
My nose is broken.
Oh, my God.
- I gotta go to the hospital.
- Andy, come on.
- Oh, my God.
- Didn't it feel good?
Come here.
Yup!
Wow, I thought you guys were doing great.
I remember trying to hire you once.
And you said you were all booked up.
That was a business tactic.
For the first two weeks, we told everyone we were booked solid to make people want us more.
Oh, no, that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.
Well, hindsight is 20/20.
Kind of seems like regular sight should have caught that one.
Also, your logo, it's the worst logo I've ever seen.
It doesn't make any sense.
It's gibberish.
We made some mistakes.
Tonight was my last chance to land a big client.
And I failed again.
God, it's so embarrassing.
Oh, hey, Tom, you're a smart guy.
And charming.
Occasionally.
You're gonna have a lot more good ideas.
Thanks.
Sorry I screwed up your campaign thing.
I really wanted to do a good job.
I made you this amazing video biography.
Of my life?
It's back at the office.
- Well, let's eat and go.
- Okay.
Didn't I ask for whipped cream on this?
Ma'am?
Ugh, does it hurt?
Yeah, you broke my nose, so - I'm sorry.
- But I don't even care.
Just get it all out there, man.
Go.
All right maybe you have to start thinking about how--how your actions affect me.
Like, tell me about stuff happening in the house.
Stop referring to my bedroom as a common space.
Stop using my comforter for your pillow forts.
Just respect me.
Absolutely.
- Really?
- Yep.
And in return, I'll only ask for one thing, which is for you to pay for studio recording time for my band to do our new album.
It's gonna be about 5,600 bucks.
Deal?
That's not gonna happen.
Here's something for the pain and some ice packs.
- Oh.
- You his friend?
Him?
Hell, no.
We're brothers.
- Excuse me.
Hey.
- Hi.
We should go.
I'm blocking an ambulance.
Ew, if your nose is all weird after this, I'm totally gonna divorce you.
Whatever, I'm gonna divorce you first for wearing my favorite hoodie.
Is everything cool?
- Yeah, it is.
- Let's go.
We just can't use Ben's comforters anymore for our pillow forts.
Ugh, what are we gonna have sex on?
The year was 1975.
It was a time of trouble.
Watergate, Vietnam, Peter Gabriel leaves Genesis.
But then, a ray of hope Leslie Barbara Knope was born on January 18, 1975.
And she has been a loyal patron of its businesses ever since.
Tom Haverford is a selfish, unctuous, sleazy, self-promoting, good-hearted, secretly kind and wonderful tiny little person.
He went to Kernston's office and basically begged him to meet with me again.
I think he technically might have bribed him.
But hey, you know, whatever works.
It was Mary pickford who once said, "This thing we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down".
Tom won't be down for long.
Her name is Leslie Knope.
And I'm gonna vote for her.
And if Lil' Sebastian were still alive, he'd surely vote for her.
And I reckon you should too.
Did ya like it?
It's pretty great, right?
Worked really hard on it.
Yeah, I loved it.
I'm gonna watch it every day for the rest of my life.
And when I die, I'm gonna project it on my tombstone.
I had an amazing time at that party.
And in the case of the woman who's stolen my heart, the culprit was Millicent Gergich.
You should look into actual detective work.
I will.
And, Jerry, I've decided to take your daughter home.
And we may be having intercourse.
Please, you've got to stop saying things like that to me.
You've got it, man.
Bye, dad.
Everything okay?
I can't find my car keys.
Solve this mystery, genius.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Miss Leslie Knope, I present to you Herb Scaifer.
Again, Andy, you don't need to bow.
As you wish, ma'am.
Okay, Herb, what can I do you for?
Well, please prepare yourself.
I have terrible news.
You do?
The world is going to end tomorrow at dawn.
Aw nuts.
You sure it's tomorrow?
Afraid so.
Right at dawn.
Zorp is going to be here to free you from your flesh.
For a while in the 1970s, our town was run by a freaky cult.
And every few years the remaining members predicted the world's gonna end.
And they have an all-night vigil in the park.
It's super annoying.
Turns out when you think the world's ending, you don't aim so carefully in the port-a-potties.
Why does the cult call themselves "The Reasonableists"?
Well, they figure if people criticize them it'll seem like they're attacking something very reasonable.
That's weirdly brilliant.
Look, there's nothing to worry about.
They've said that the world is going to end 15 times.
And the only bad thing that's ever happened on any of those dates is Lance Armstrong dumping Sheryl Crow.
- That was a tragic day.
- Hmm.
Live strong.
In any rate, I think Ben and I should accompany you tonight.
Oh, I don't think we have to do that.
No, no, no, I insist.
These people live on planet nutbrain.
I live on planet nut bran.
Bran and nuts are very helpful for your colon!
Well, it looks like we're kind of forced to hang out with each other.
Yeah, listen, I'll--I'll come for a bit, but if it's okay with you, I'm not going to stay.
It's just, you know, still kind of weird, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mm-hmm, totally get it.
Definitely get it.
Ben and I don't hang out much these days.
Big deal, lots of people don't hang out.
Jerry and April.
Obama and Madonna, probably.
We're in good company.
Hello!
So it looks like we'll each end up with about $5,000 apiece.
Stop.
We get five g's each?
That's amazing!
You started out with 450,000.
Entertainment720 is dead.
It's up in company heaven.
Along with pets.com, Blockbuster and askjeeves.
My company is no better than a company where you ask a fake butler to Google things for you.
So what's next, Tommy Davidson?
I say we invest our ten large and then I "accidentally" get run over by a city bus and we start our own hip-hop label.
We have this place for one more night, right?
We're outtie tomorrow at noon.
What if we took every dime we had left, threw one last party.
Made it the essence of everything we wanted the company to be.
A party For the end of the world.
Shh!
You had me at "every dime we have left".
Because I'm in like Lara Flynn Boyle from The Practice.
Dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly swag!
What should we do tonight?
I don't know, I just figure we'll just order some pizza.
You watch me play Xbox, and then I could watch you make some prank phone calls?
We get hammered?
Make out?
We do that every night.
That's because repetition is the key to a good marriage.
Let's do something weird.
Come on, it could be the last night on earth.
We could do something off my bucket list.
You have a bucket list?
Catch the winning touchdown at the super bowl.
Make the most amazing grilled-cheese sandwich ever.
Win the lottery.
Ride a unicycle.
Invent something.
I'd like to remake the movie Shazaam with Shaquille O'Neal where he plays a genie and I'd like to get it right.
Go skydiving.
Outrun a hippo.
Fly first class on plane.
And when people are walking by, be like this.
All right, well, this is what we're doing tonight.
- Wait, which one?
- This one.
And how much is left in the bank account?
and four cents.
Whoa!
Still a lot left over.
Okay, you wanted to hold $1,000 cash in your hands, that's super disappointing.
Yes!
Now this is what I imagined!
Have you ever seen this much cash in your entire life?
I just handed it to you.
Nickels!
I want nickels.
- A billion nickels!
- No, Andy.
Evening, gentlemen.
- Hey, Ron!
- Hail Zorp.
It is a beautiful night for the end of the world.
Congratulations to all of you for reaching the finish line.
The Zorpies are ridiculous.
But, like the founding fathers, I believe in absolute freedom of religion.
Also their ceremonies require the playing of flutes.
I happen to make flutes in my wood shop.
Flutes are $80 apiece.
And recorders are 150.
Hey, they're beautiful.
Would you take a check?
- You can cash it tomorrow.
- Sure.
Welcome to E720's end of the world celebration.
The entire party's a VIP area.
There's also a double VIP area.
A triple VIP area.
And the Centurion Club elite VIP area.
Sponsored by Sobe Lifewater.
No one's allowed in there, not even us.
Uh- uh.
We also hired ten huge, scary bouncers with earpieces.
- What up, Keith?
- Mmm.
He actually once tossed me out of a club three years ago.
Water under the bridge.
DJ Bluntz is mixing up some new beats.
Ballers and ballerettes, fasten your seatbelts.
The perfect party begins Clink!
Now.
Thank God.
No one shows up to a good party on time.
If anybody actually showed up right now, the whole party would have been ruined.
It would have been a disaster.
I don't want to go to that party.
Does the city consider them a threat to public safety?
Oh, not at all, Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
So I shouldn't interpret anything from the fact that there are two people from the city manager's office here?
Well, nothing except that I had nothing better to do.
Which probably says more about me than them.
Thanks.
- Thanks.
- Headline idea.
"It's the end of the world as they know it, but Pawnee feels fine".
- It's a little long.
- Okay, "Zorp Shmorp!
"Doomsday prediction falls flat "as citizens spend pleasant evening enjoying one of Pawnee's finest parks".
Somehow longer.
Right, okay let's go with the first one.
Great, um, hey, also He's cute.
Is he single, do you know?
Chris?
No.
He's actually dating Jerry's daughter.
Oh, no sorry, I meant Ben.
What's his story?
- Who?
- Ben?
I-I don't know.
I--I'm not s-- I'm not sure.
He's, um, a man and he's a worker.
And he is--uh, we've never discussed sex, so It's--we've always just been very businesslike, so Your guess is as good-- nay, better than mine.
The end.
By Leslie Knope.
Okay.
Cool, thanks.
H--happy to help.
What's happening?
The world is ending.
Oh boy, I know how this goes.
I know how Shauna operates.
She smiles, and then they fall in love, and then they get married, and then she changes her name to Shauna Malwae-Wyatt.
Or he's going to be really progressive and change his name to Ben Wyatt-Malwae-Tweep.
God, I am so annoyed that he would hypothetically do that.
I'm gonna remind you that the reason you're not dating him is because you decided to run for city council.
Oh, so just because I can't go out with him, someone else can?
- Oh, boy, okay.
- Wow.
Okay, I'm sure this is nothing.
Okay, well, that was definitely something.
- Oh.
My God.
- I know that move.
They're gonna have sex in five minutes.
I've gotta stop this.
I've got to keep them away from each other for the rest of their lives.
- How are you gonna do that?
- Unclear!
Oh, yeah, ten bucks!
That counts as winning the lottery.
Okay, now is this the most amazing grilled-cheese sandwich ever made?
Mmm, it's pretty awesome.
Honey, my bucket list doesn't say "make a pretty awesome grilled-cheese sandwich".
Gotta go back to the store.
We're gonna get a different kind of cheese.
No, no, no, dude, seriously.
This is the most amazing grilled-cheese sandwich ever made, okay?
Okay.
What's next?
Hey, there you are.
Wow, you two are still talking?
Ben hasn't bored you to death by now.
- Hey.
- So boring.
Actually, we were having a really great talk.
- Keep your pants on.
- What?
I mean, keep your pants on, girl!
I mean, those are really nice pants.
I really like your pants.
Where'd you get them?
Do you want to go buy some more pants?
Or, um, walk away from here?
I might head over to that end of the world party.
Oh, that's where all the losers are going.
Yeah, what is that?
Tom emailed me.
- I could check that out.
- Hurrrrr Well, then you should stay here then.
Because you can't go.
I mean, what if you're not here when Zorp shows up?
Boy, would your face be red.
When Zorp shows up, your faces will be melted off and used as fuel.
You want to be here for that.
I think I'll take my chances.
Leslie, thanks as always.
Wow.
What an unbelievably unpleasant person.
Melissa, get in there - with your bad self.
- All right.
- You ready?
- I'm ready.
Anything you grab is yours to keep.
Hit it!
Yes!
The perfect party.
It's an elusive idea.
People have to be completely entertained from the moment they walk in, to the moment they leave.
It's a grand experiment.
And I am a party scientist.
Welcome to my laboratory.
That was Symphony for the Righteous Destruction of Humanity in E minor.
By the late Lou Prozotovich.
Reminder.
These flutes are available for purchase.
You can't take it with you people.
Herb, I just speed-read both of your books.
- Ooh.
- And, full disclosure, I think they're bonkers-filled.
But I did notice that you're interested in reincarnation.
Tell me about that.
Well, it makes sense, doesn't it?
From the universe, we emerge.
Into the universe, we return.
And there are infinite forms we can take in infinite universes.
What a lovely thought.
Well, this morning at dawn, you will take a new form.
That of a fleshless, chattering skeleton when Zorp the surveyor arrives and burns your flesh off with his volcano mouth.
That was very strange what you just said.
I don't like it as much as that other thing you said.
Oh.
Hey, hey, where you going?
Where you headed off to?
Do you want to play a fun game with me that I made up called chess-risk?
It's half chess, half risk and takes like 15 hours to play.
Okay, yeah, I think I'm gonna go.
- I--okay.
- All right?
- Oh, my God!
- What?
I forgot I have a thing I need to show you.
Oh.
I need to bring you there right now it's so amazing.
It's going to freak you out.
It's, uh, it's something that we need to get in my car and go to, so let's do that.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Leslie, where are you going?
I'm going to the thing that I told you about with Ben.
No spoilers, Ann.
She's been there before.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
What's up, what's up?
Are you guys having a good time tonight?
I think we've gotta take things to the next level.
Drum line, hit it!
- Okay, I'm ready!
- Good.
Wait!
I'm not ready.
Super scared.
Andy, you said you wanted to be an action star.
This is your chance.
Okay.
Okay, you, Natalie, follow the action.
What do I have to do?
Just hold up this butter knife to my throat and pretend like you're holding me hostage.
- What?
- Ready!
I don't know.
It seems a little crazy.
Just crazy enough to work.
Aah!
Ahh!
Oh, my face!
My face!
Is fine, Mikhail Petrov!
Forget it, Macklin, you're too late-- - I'm sorry, guys.
- Jerry!
I need my cheaters.
I cannot see anyth-- you're doing really good, you're doing really good.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Help me, Agent Macklin, help me!
He's stolen my jewels, and now he's going to ravish my body and he stinks, he really stinks!
Okay, Janet Snakehole belongs to mother Russia now.
Oh, that's what you think!
- No.
- I hope you like pain!
- What are you doing?
- Pow!
Say the line.
Looks like this Siberian husky is going to be Russian off to jail.
Hey, know what, can I go?
Gayle is making a roast.
Ugh.
We've already been down this street.
Just out of curiosity, where's your favorite place to go like ever?
Well, I don't know.
Tom's party sounded kind of fun.
Here we are!
We're at the special place!
Well, here we are.
What do you think?
Are you gonna murder me and bury me at this gas station?
No, this is a great gas station.
This gas station was owned by Mick Jagger.
Uh-huh.
I came across some financial records when I was doing some research for my book, and this gas station was owned by an M. Jagger, which at first I thought was a woman.
Maybe Meg or something, but I think the most likely explanation is that legendary Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger owned this gas station from 1951 to 1958.
I know what you're doing, Leslie.
I'm showing you a part of Rock and Roll history.
You--you can't do this.
You know we broke up.
And I kind of feel like we shouldn't Hang out together, just the two of us.
Because every time we do, it just makes it harder.
You know?
Okay.
Okay.
I think we've done everything on the list that we can actually do.
What about this?
Oh, my God, that would be awesome.
- It's impossible.
- No, it isn't.
We have $1,000 in our bank account, and we're young and irresponsible.
I mean, our car would break down.
There's no way we could even get there.
So I'll steal my dad's car.
Look, this is a stupid idea, but right at this exact second, we have enough momentum to do something stupid before we realize how stupid it is.
You are absolutely right.
No thinking, just stupid.
Yes!
Buddhists feel that human beings are unlikely to be reincarnated as human beings.
So the problem with reincarnation is that you could be reborn as a pretzel.
Or a socket wrench.
Ron, if you could be reincarnated, what would you like to be?
Socket wrench sounds pretty good, actually.
What religion am I?
Well, I'm a practicing none of your  Business.
I think the danger in believing in reincarnation is that you spend so much time trying to figure out what you're going to be in the next lifetime that you forget to enjoy the one you're in now.
Ann Perkins that was beautiful.
Drum lines, personalized gift bags, tigers.
This is the best party I've ever been to.
And I'm not just saying that.
For real, T.T., think about it, man.
It's pretty great.
But it's not perfect.
Tom.
Hey, Lucy, what are you doing here?
Jean-Ralphio called me and told me that this was a very special occasion and I should come down.
It's nice to see you.
Yeah, good to see you too.
Want to go dance?
Yeah, yeah!
Uh, give me a minute.
Okay.
I can't believe you called her for me.
That's really nice of you, man, for real.
Thanks.
No, no, no, thank you.
I mean for everything.
I actually forgot they ever dated.
I was trying to hit that.
Dawn is nigh!
Zorp the surveyor approaches, and all earthly debts will be repaid.
Last call for doughnuts.
Can I speak with you about a personal matter?
Normally, no.
But given there's only 20 minutes until the end of human existence Also, no.
I lost my mind tonight.
I tried to screw up even the potential of Ben dating someone else.
Did you not hear me when I said no?
Oh, we broke up because of me.
But I have to tell you, Ron If the world was ending tomorrow, I'd want to be with him.
Well, that's significant.
Problem is, Leslie, the world's not ending tomorrow.
The sun's going to rise right over there.
It'll be a regular Friday, and you'll be in the exact same position you were in before.
I know.
It's just the thought of him with someone else is making me miserable.
If it makes you feel any better, Leslie, we'll all be dead in 20 minutes.
That does make me feel better.
Thank you, Herb.
- We did it!
- Yay!
This car is nice!
How long you think it'll take us?
Uh, the map says 30 hours but I drive really fast.
- 30 hours?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, crap!
I didn't bring any music.
No!
I'll tell you what.
You play whatever you want, I'm just going to take a real quick snooze for like 12 hours so I'm fresh.
Thank you guys so much for coming out.
If you're too drunk to drive, please take one of our shuttles home.
Valet service will drop your car off later today.
If you're one of our designated drivers, please take a "thank you" bag.
And enjoy the giant bows I put on your car.
- Hey!
- Hey.
- It's great seeing you.
- You too.
Are, uh, you sticking around for a bit, or Nah, I'm heading to Bloomington right now.
- Oh.
- Grad school's fun, but I do miss this town.
- Yeah.
- What's wrong?
I don't know.
After this is done, I'm gonna be broke, and I'm not gonna have a job.
Well, if it's any consolation, this was honestly the best party I've ever been to.
Hey, it was pretty great.
I-I was really aiming for something-- I'll see you around.
Whoo.
You saw that.
You saw that too.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep thinks you're cute.
- What?
- That's why I took you to Mick Jagger's abandoned gas station.
Because she thinks you're cute, and I was afraid you guys were gonna make out and have babies, and I had no right to do that to you or your future children.
And it wasn't until just now that I realized the romantic part of our relationship is over.
So I'm sorry.
And, uh, why don't you tell Shauna to make herself decent and I'll apologize to her as well.
Oh, well, Shauna's not here.
- Oh.
- See what I did?
- I do.
- I'm very sneaky.
Okay, okay, well.
It's so much more beautiful than I could have ever even imagined.
Yeah.
I'm trying to find a way to be annoyed by it, but Coming up empty.
Thank you so much.
I never would have ever done this without you.
Thank you.
Where's all the faces?
Like the presidents.
All the scholarly work that I did on these texts?
Indicated that the world would end.
Oh, gosh, I'm as disappointed as you are, Herb.
Yeah, but I went home and began to reevaluate the texts.
You don't say.
And I realized that I'd made some crucial errors well, math is hard.
Yes, well, the actual end of the world is May 19.
Okay, let's see what we've got.
Um, oh, on the 19th we can't give you the park.
We have a Spring spectacular free ice cream giveaway.
Heh!
I misspoke.
Yeah, it's May 20?
That is free.
- Ah!
- Okay.
End of World, May 20th.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Oh hey, Ben.
Have you seen my complete collection of all Ooh!
Here they are.
Wow!
So, I've been asked to run this year's Model UN at Pawnee Central High School.
Attendance has been low.
And if I don't make it awesome, they may cancel it.
I wonder if I'm gonna make it awesome.
Or I can be South Korea, you can be Bangladesh.
You can form like a Trans-Asiatic alliance.
Yeah, I like it.
And I see the merits of it.
I just worry if we're both in Asia, - it might limit our scope.
- Mm.
I kinda want to roll up my sleeves and make geopolitical problem-solving my bitch.
Amen, brother.
Let's go back to plan "A".
I'll be Denmark, you be Peru.
Yes!
Oh, I didn't really do Model United Nations in high school, so Oh, wait.
I super-did.
I need a few more volunteers.
Andy, will you be Iceland?
The bad guys from Mighty Ducks 2?
- Don't think so.
- Okay, how about Japan?
The bad guys from Karate Kid 2?
Even worse.
How 'bout Germany?
They've never been the bad guys.
Why don't you be Finland?
- Okay.
- Okay?
And I'll be the Moon.
No, you're gonna be South Africa or - Pakistan.
- I'm the Moon, or I quit.
- April.
- Moon or quit, man.
Fine.
You be South Africa, and you can also secretly run the moon.
The Moon accepts your ridiculous proposal.
Ron!
You wanna join us?
Look!
I'll let you be America.
And teach kids that not only is government good but that there should be a World-wide super-government?
I'd rather sand down my toenails.
Every three weeks, I have to sand down my toenails.
They're too strong for clippers.
Excuse me.
Are you Leslie Knope?
Oh, what am I talking about?
- Of course you are.
- Bonjour, Madame Ambassadeur.
Thank you so much for coming and trying to help save our club.
We're so excited to see a true Pawnee Model U.N. legend in action.
- Thank you.
- I really wouldn't describe myself as a Model U.N. legend.
I'd go with icon.
Or hero.
Look, if you ask me, Enron is down but not out.
Who doesn't like a comeback story?
All right, you wanna hear my plan, get at me later.
I gotta meet up with an old friend.
All right, peace, man.
Let's go do this lunch thing.
I just have one more quick interview.
I'm still trying to find your replacement.
That is, unless you want your old job back.
I told you before, Ronseph, I moved on to bigger things.
E720 going under was a blessing.
I'm tearing it up all over town like a boss.
Sounds great, Tommy.
I've offered Tom his job back several times, and each time he's told me he's just too busy being an entrepreneur.
Then two days ago, I saw him spraying cologne samples at Macy's.
The young man has a lot of pride.
This isn't gonna be easy.
Ann Perkins.
- Hey, Chris, how's it going?
- Not good.
- Can I talk to you?
- Okay.
I'm not sure if you're aware, but I am romantically involved with Jerry Gergich's surprisingly hot daughter - Millicent Gergich.
- Yeah.
You were grinding with her pretty hard at April's Halloween party.
That's correct.
Anyway, we've been on four dates, but now Millicent Gergich hasn't returned my last two phone calls.
I think the relationship may be in trouble, and I don't know why.
Wow.
A four-date-long relationship might not be 100% perfect?
I think you should launch a full-scale investigation.
The root of sarcasm is truth, Ann.
I am going to launch a full-scale investigation.
And I sincerely thank you for that suggestion.
Glad I could help in these trying times.
Sarcasm again!
You're a delight.
You've all been preparing for months for this year's geopolitical scenario global food crisis.
Security Council, we need you to lead us, or billions of people will starve to death.
But most importantly, have fun.
Due to my campaign, the romantic aspect of our relationship is over.
And I'm totally fine with that.
But Ben and I have so much in common.
I mean, we're amazing friends.
And friendship is better because friends help you move.
They drive you to the airport.
Boyfriends just love you and marry you.
Jerry!
I am launching a full-scale investigation into my romantic relationship with your daughter Millicent Gergich, and I thought I could pick your brain.
Aw, jeez, I really shouldn't be involved in someth Quick recap things were going wonderfully.
We clicked on an emotional level.
And then suddenly, I just stopped hearing from her.
Now, you must know her pretty well what gives?
Here's what I saw go down.
Donna!
Yeah!
Get in on this.
You're too accessible.
Every time she calls, you answer.
You gotta dangle the carrot, literally and metaphorically.
- Thank you, Donna!
- Thanks, Donna.
SoCourtney.
This says you retired in 1968.
No, no, no.
I was fired because I made a pass at an ethnic woman.
And what have you been doing for the last 43 years?
Oh, you know, hitchhiking around.
I went to Mexico.
I met a lot of ethnic girls.
They grow on trees down there.
I was in jail for a spell That about brings it up to date.
Sounds to me like you're ready to get back in the game, Courtney.
We'll be in touch.
Another very strong candidate.
Are you insane?
He was a million-year-old racist!
He said he liked ethnic girls, Tom.
I'm sorry, Ron, but I created a legacy here, and I need to make sure it's protected.
Let's bring in some more people.
In my four years here, I revolutionized the position of administrator and made this place cool.
I was the first person to abbreviate Parks and Recreation Department.
First it was Parks and Recreation.
Then Parks and Rec.
Then P&R.
Then lengthened it just a little bit to Tommy's place.
Okay, wait a minute.
I think I have it.
What if we dropped interest rates.
- Would that help you?
- Maybe.
But what if Brazil and Argentina use their oil deposits as collateral?
Oh, that's really good.
Under-exaggerate much, France?
Ha ha!
Nice!
Hey, Leslie, you ready?
- Oh!
- Ow.
- Sorry.
- That's okay.
- Hi, William.
- Hi.
You ready?
Yes.
Absolutely.
UmThey want me to do a photo op for the campaign so I can bolster my education credentials.
- Can we just press pause here?
- How long is it gonna take?
I'm not really sure.
Can you just tread water until I'm ready?
Oh, sure, yeah.
I'll just tread water until you're ready.
Thanks, buddy.
Leslie and I aren't dating anymore, but, uh, we're friends.
So it's fun.
It's just fun.
It's fun it's fun It is fun.
Thanks a lot.
Yes!
Honey!
I just traded Finland's military to Kenya for 50 lions.
That's pretty good, right?
- Yeah - Okay.
But also militaries are pretty good at protecting countries.
But so are lions.
And you don't have to pay them.
These kids are idiots.
I've just traded all of Finland's boring stuff for every other country's lions?
I definitely have more lions than any other country in the whole world right now.
I have no idea what's going on.
But if that ends up meaning something in this game, I'd say I'm set.
Hey, so Russia and China are about to propose their own plan, so the kids kinda want to get ours out there.
Oh, okay this should probably only take five more minutes.
Let's say 10 or 15 to be safe.
Well, how about me make it a cool 40?
I'm sorry.
It's just important.
Well, this is important too.
It's kinda why we came here.
I'm sorry, could you Just step over here?
- You're in the shot.
- Oh, of course.
Her life is so awesome.
You're lucky you're friends with her.
Shut up, Bulgaria!
I know, well, that's the great thing about treaties, - It doesn't even matter.
- Hey!
I'm back.
Or, as they say in Denmark "I'm back".
Most people speak English.
So are you guys ready to polish off this treaty?
Oh, uh actually, I merged our treaty with Russia and China's treaty.
I got cut out of my own treaty?
Yeah.
I got sick of treading water, so I swam over to Asia, made a deal.
The nation of Denmark would like to formerly request a summit with the nation of Peru over there by the refreshment table.
Because the nation of Denmark needs a juice box.
I am shocked an appalled by the actions of the honorable delegate from Peru.
Leslie, just look I thought I could handle being friends with you.
But I can't, okay?
Now, we agreed the other night that we can't spend time together.
I think that was the right call.
But that was in a romantic way.
We can still spend time together as friends.
It doesn't work that way.
You can't just chop up the aspects of a relationship into discrete parts and select the ones you want like a buffet.
- Why not?
- Because it's selfish.
Stop being obtuse.
Look, I understand where he's coming from.
But I have been nothing but straightforward with him, and if anyone in the entire world should understand the difficult position I'm in, it's It's just I've made an effort and I've shared my flags with him, and suddenly, he doesn't want to be friends?
You know what?
That leaves me with only one option.
Just excuse me for a Attention.
This is an urgent world matter.
Due to a recent betrayal, my homeland, the great state of Denmark, has officially decided to declare war on Peru.
Scandinavian brothers, on my signal.
Unleash hell!
See, I just don't believe in this whole don't let people know how you feel nonsense.
I love telling people how I feel.
Mostly because I love most people.
And I love telling them that I love them.
You didn't tell that girl you love her, did you?
- No.
I'm not crazy.
- What is this urgent meeting with Donna and Jerry?
Ann Perkins.
I took your advice.
- My sarcastic advice.
- Precisely.
And we're getting to the bottom of what's going on with me and Jerry's daughter, and I thought you would be a tremendous addition to this think tank.
This is incredibly inappropriate.
- Oh, thank you!
- Okay, I'm game.
No.
I'm not kidding.
My name's Gary, and I'm from Gary, Indiana.
Amazing.
People like hearing that.
It's probably one of my stronger anecdotes.
A fact is not an anecdote, Gary.
Here's an anecdote Today I met the most boring man in the world.
His name was Gary.
Hmm.
Now Keith.
Under sex, you wrote "Yes.
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha".
- Well-played.
- Thank you.
Ah, but all jokes aside.
I'm a boy.
Keith, I had this job for four years.
And I can tell you, you get out of it what you put into it.
What are you hoping to get out of it?
In like a month or so.
- What?
- OhWhat!
What am I hoping to get out of this job?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like one one month of money Would be would be just right.
Let me give you a situation.
You're hosting a town hall meeting for local businesses.
Uh That's so much stuff.
You just, uh kept on going.
That was like one thing.
I didn't even get to the situation yet.
Oh!
All right.
Well, thanks, guys.
I think we've all seen enough.
Still not totally sure what I'm applying for.
Butif you ask me, I think it went pretty well.
What we need to focus on is how to destroy Peru, specifically one person who lives there.
Madame Ambassador, are you changing the scenario?
We didn't prepare for this.
Global politics can change, and scenarios can arise and suddenly you're just like, "wait, I thought this one thing, "but look over there.
That's a different thing, and it's changing everything," and I'm like, "what"?
Hold up".
Who has tanks for me?
I-I'm sorry, but We're gonna keep trying to solve the food crisis.
Food schmood.
This is war.
God, it's time for you to nut up, Switzerland.
Well, well, well, look who is brave enough to show his face in Europe.
Say the word, Leslie.
I'll sick my army of lions on him.
Okay, look, I think, um Things are starting to get a little out of control here.
I agree.
You betrayed me, and you went behind my back, and now you need to pay.
I need to I need to pay.
Do I stutter?
Oh.
Okay.
Fair enough.
Oh, you know what?
You might wanna borrow this.
Ew, no one wants your dirty underwear, Ben.
It's not dirty underwear.
It's a white flag, and you may as well start waving it right now the only thing I will be waving is your decapitated head on a stick in front of your weeping mother!
Good lord.
They were duds, Ron.
Really, anything would be better than the people we interviewed today.
I guess you're right, Tom.
I'm not gonna find another you.
You were perfect.
Competent enough to keep the bosses off my back, but selfish enough to slow down all the work.
Tom Haverfords don't grow on trees.
If they did, I'd sell 'em.
Tommy trees.
Would you consider coming back?
Sorry, Ron.
No can do.
I'm like a shark.
I don't swim backwards.
See ya later, man.
We've been making great strides with genetically modified crops and would gladly pledge to continue the growth of excuse me, Madame Ambassador.
- Excuse me.
- I'm not finished.
Oh, really?
Then why do I have the microphone?
I move that the Security Council formally condemn Denmark and stop them from making any more unwarranted acts of aggression.
As long as you quit derailing the conference.
People are dying of hunger in Africa.
Oh, cry me a river.
All in favor of the resolution.
- What?
!
- Oh, that's interesting.
The resolution passes with flying colors.
Denmark is formally condemned.
Bam!
That's no problemo, Peru, because Denmark no longer recognizes the authority of this international gang of thugs.
And history will be unkind to those who stand opposed to justice.
Together, we stand and I ask all of you who is ready to join the Coalition of the Willing?
The Moon shall join your coalition.
Yeah!
We got the freaking moon.
What are you gonna do without tides, Peru?
Okay.
We need to stop dealing in hypotheticals.
Ann, we dated.
What happened to us?
Really?
Do you wanna get real?
Sure.
Sounds like fun.
Sometimes your relentless cheeriness is confusing.
Like that time we went to Eagleton and we got that hotel room with the jacuzzi Ooh, this just got real good!
And the jacuzzi broke.
But I did eat food off of your body.
- Oh, come on.
- All right, Chris and Ann!
I just wanna go back to work.
So the Coalition of the Willing is Denmark, Botswana, and the Moon.
The big three.
Now, here's what we're gonna do.
Ben is probably shoring up his support in South America.
While he does that, we are gonna make sure Attention!
The Security Council has decided to expel Peru and Denmark from the United Nations.
Madame Ambassadeur Pourquoi?
'Cause you guys suck.
Look around.
We thought you were gonna teach us how to solve problems.
You've ruined my favorite club.
Thanks a lot.
Did we win?
I think we won!
What were we trying to do?
I learned so much today.
I just wanted to say that I thought it was really cool how everything fell apart in there.
And also, maybe you should talk to Ben.
No.
He's being a jerk.
Please?
When Ben gets upset, he becomes a really bad roommate.
He takes really long sadness baths and makes me late for stuff.
I hate it here.
Can't wait to graduate.
Yeah, but summer's gonna totally kick ass.
So you're saying that I intimidated you?
- No.
Not exactly.
- Come on.
Talk more about that tantric workshop y'all went to.
I was so into you, okay, and you basically turned me into a female version of yourself, and then you got bored dating me because you were dating yourself.
Huh I mean, I was jogging.
I hate jogging.
- Jogging's amazing!
- Jogging is the worst, Chris.
I mean, I know it keeps you healthy, but God, at what cost?
Well, I'm sorry that I added five years to your life.
Now I'm being sarcastic.
Like you.
I'm doing something that you like.
Being with you definitely made me do a lot of soul-searching, and I came out the other side being a much more self-possessed person.
Well, I'm glad.
Good luck with Millicent.
Just back off a little bit.
Let her be herself.
Everything'll be fine.
Thank you.
If you rearrange the letters of Peru, you could spell Europe.
That's That's not true.
Well You have to rearrange them.
- Oh - Delegates!
I know that you're angry with each other.
Hopefully, this will be your opportunity to have your very own Camp David.
In high school, my buddy David Fundis would have these campouts in his backyard.
We would just chill out, have a bonfire, talk about whatever was on our mind.
We called it camp David.
How do you know about Camp David?
How do you know about camp David?
Ooookay.
You guys are being stupid, so why don't you work it out - while Andy and I - Throw these scientist bottles - off the roof?
- No.
That's right.
See ya.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
It's bad enough that we can't be together, but the thought of us not being friends is Is just too crappy for me to handle.
I was perhaps a little icier than I needed to be.
I just need you to be in my life.
You're too important to me.
I wish I could say it's possible.
I just I don't know if it is right now.
Well, I propose a treaty that states that we have a fun conversation once a day at work for five minutes.
I'll take it to the Peruvian senate.
Or whatever.
- Please do that.
- I'll try.
I'll see what they say.
What do we do with those kids?
We totally ruined their club.
I could tell you what I would like when I was their age.
Ben, how are we gonna get Kathy Ireland to do naked aerobics for them?
Okay.
I regret telling you that very much.
Hey.
Oh, hey, Ron.
All right.
I gotta come clean.
I saw you spraying cologne samples at Macy's.
What?
Macy's?
That wasn't me.
There's a Macy's in town?
Where's the Macy's in town?
I heard they have an amazing cologne sample guy.
Just take the job, Tommy.
Come on back.
I quit to peruse my dream.
And my dream collapsed.
It's embarrassing, Ron.
I can't go from a CEO back to being an administrator.
Is there anything I can do to make you feel okay about coming back?
Everyone, please Help me.
I'm trying to get Tom back.
I'm begging.
This department just doesn't work without you.
What do you say?
Ron, this is embarrassing.
Even for you.
I'm not coming back.
Peace out, my dudes.
Excuse me, everyone.
That was great.
So what I'm thinking is I'll come back in a few days, you'll beg me again aah!
So if it's okay with you guys, I would like to ask Ron for my job back.
Ron May I have my job back, please?
Thank you.
I will see you all Monday.
Looking forward to it.
Ah, France, bienvenue.
My name is Cassidy, - and I'm really annoyed with you.
- Yes.
And you have every right to be, but we're hoping what we're gonna show you right now will make up for that.
- What?
- Oh, my God!
Pawnee City Council chambers.
The nicest room in City Hall by a factor of like a million.
Go ahead.
Sit down.
Leslie and I feel terrible for war breaking out at your Model U.N. Which, for the record, Denmark would have won, but that's neither here nor there.
Thanks to a coordinated effort between the parks department and the city manager's office, three months from now, we are gonna hold a State-wide Model U.N. In this room, - and you're gonna run the show.
- What?
And we will just be not here.
- Or taking some small countries.
- No, no, no, no.
No.
Fine.
Not here.
- Sound good?
- Yes!
Those kids are passionate about something.
That's important.
That's all there is, really, is passion.
Passion is what makes for good treaties - Cheese!
- Good relationships Good pizza.
Good friends.
Good everything.
Including wars.
* Ladies and Gentlemen, "He was gone but never forgotten".
"He makes all the ladies want" No, I'm not gonna say that.
"Swagger beats and I get the Who's the" All right, forget it.
Welcome back, Tom Haverford!
Tick-tock, it's Tommy time!
I'm sorry, I have to object again.
This just seems unfair.
I understand that, Jerry.
But the problem is is that Tom came back and Andy's my assistant, so I kinda need him close to me.
Okay, but I can't even hear anything because of the noise from the copier.
Sorry.
These are really important.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Tom!
I would like you to redesign our Parks department logo.
Sounds cool so far.
Rethink our visual brand, take these words, and make something amazing.
So you're saying you want me Yes, essentially I'd like Jerry, I am making you my number-two guy Come on, that's too close.
Let's make him a number-three.
Fair enough.
Jerry, you're number three.
There's only two of us.
He has been in this department a long time.
I think maybe you could learn somethg from him.
Our research shows that our park will draw and I want this to be the most amazing, awe-inspiring, fun-filled park ever conceived.
Now how big is the park, exactly?
It is .
000003 square miles.
Recently, the last remaining telephone booths in Pawnee were torn down, and on that patch of concrete, I am creating Pawnee's newest tourist attraction$$$ The smallest park in Indiana.
The title is currently held by Martin Luther King, Jr. Park in Terryville, but guess what?
Terryville sucks old car tires, and so does Martin Luther-- No, he does not suck old car tires.
He was one of the greatest men in history.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I get competitive.
Has there been any resistance from the community?
No, not at all.
It's so small we don't even need to do an environmental impact report.
It's inexpensive, it benefits the town, it's a total slam dunk.
You two, when you work on a project together, Man, all these classes look amazing.
I can't choose.
They do this thing called a "shopping period," where you can just sample as many classes as you want.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Sports and Society.
Physical Science.
A crash course?
Yeah, but it's not what you think.
Oh.
I did not graduate college, because I did not "attend" it, but I'm trying to improve myself, so I'm gonna start by taking just one class.
If you're gonna take a college course, Andrew, you should explore a new subject.
- Broaden your horizons.
- Yup.
Horizons are dumb.
Never broaden your horizons.
Yup.
Just take something you're great at and get an easy "A".
No offense, Ron, but April's way sounds way easier.
Guitar for beginners.
I value a good education, so I don't want to see Andy waste his time in college.
Of all my coworkers, he is one of a small number whom I do not actively root against.
Ugh, there I go getting all sappy.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, I have about nine things I need to talk to you about.
The first is the ribbon-cutting ceremony.
Do you know who's bringing scissors?
Because I cannot tell you how many ceremonies get derailed when people don't bring scissors.
- Number two-- - Right.
Um, listen.
I'm actually glad you're here.
Oh, yeah?
After this project finishes, I'm gonna focus on other departments and cut down my time with Parks and Rec.
What?
Well, look, I mean, we tried hanging out together, we tried working together, and it just Bums me out.
No, no, no.
We're just working out the kinks.
You don't need to decrease your time with me.
In fact, you need to increase your time with me.
You need to spend more time with me.
That make sense?
I think it does.
No, Leslie, no, listen to me.
After The Smallest Park wraps up, I am going to ask Chris to take over all Parks and Rec business.
Okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I need to ascertain the whereabouts of some oversized ceremonial scissors.
I-- Those are my pens and pencils.
No, see, I think that Comic Sans always screams "fun".
Right?
But, man, those "r"s in Helvetica, they're just, you know, like, really popping for me.
I've never been more bored in my entire life.
Who cares about letters?
is the Sopranos one, where the "r" is a pistol.
Let's think bigger, people, come on.
What about a top-to-bottom makeover for the entire department?
I'm talking new uniforms, new signage, new color scheme.
A whole, new, sexy vibe.
I don't know.
This really isn't what Chris asked us to do.
You know, maybe we should just stick to the assignment.
Cool, Jerry.
I'd take your advice if I wanted to be a dead-eyed government drone with no ambition.
Yes, technically my new job is my old job, but I'm not some boring, Jerry Gergich-type guy.
I'm more of a Steve Harvey.
I dream big, I shake things up, and I always wear dope suits.
Okay, can anyone tell me what this is called?
- Uh, that's a fret.
- Yeah.
And that little thing you got right there-- that's called a capo.
Changes the key.
Uh, maybe you should be in the advanced class?
Yeah, maybe I should.
Dude, dumb it down.
But I couldn't possibly, because I'm just a beginner.
I barely haven't even ever seen a "gortar".
Okay.
We will be working on basic chords for the first four weeks.
Oh, my God.
Four weeks.
I'm already bored.
Of course you are.
You're not challenging yourself.
I suggest we sample a few more classes.
Fine.
Very good.
Good-bye, everybody.
Guess what.
I was secretly an undercover rock star this whole time.
For what it's worth, I think you would make an incredible brunette.
Ron Swanson.
I mean, he's not even attending the ribbon-cutting ceremony of a park that we made together.
I'm sorry, Leslie.
I'm just freaking out.
The only thing we have left is work.
And now he doesn't want to work together anymore?
What does that all mean?
I think you know what it means.
Yeah.
I should just drag out that tiny park project for as long as possible so Ben and I can keep working together.
That's almost exactly the opposite of what I meant.
No, what I'll do is I'll get the neighborhood all riled up, and then maybe they'll ask for an environmental impact report-- and then Ben and I will work together for at least another year.
- Leslie, for God's sakes.
- Good idea, Ann.
No, Ann, please, I beg of you.
Will you just shut your beautiful pie hole?
Just sit there, let me stare at you while you silently support me on this game plan.
- Leslie-- - Shh-- - Ann - Leslie Your quiet support means the world to me.
As well as your tacit endorsement of all my behaviors.
As a mature, reasonable adult, I understand that this will be the last project that Ben and I are working on together.
So please join us for the grand opening of Pawnee's Smallest Park on November 12th, 2070.
Thank you for coming to this very important and what I suspect will be lengthy, meeting.
The proposed park is very small, but we believe we need to investigate every detail.
So if anyone has any questions for me or assistant city manager Ben Wyatt, go right ahead.
Hi, I have a question about this project.
Whoa, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where's the fire?
Let's get to know each other first.
Tell me about your childhood.
Is there going to be basketball there?
Basketball courts attract undesirables to my community.
Well, there's barely room for an actual basketball, much less a court.
Because there's a definite type of person I associate with basketball, and I'd rather not have that type of person nearby.
Don't worry.
You don't need to worry.
Okay, I'll just come right out and say it.
I'll tell you what type of person I don't like.
You don't have to do that.
No, no, no, no.
I think we get it.
Yeah, we do, Rose, and you bring up a very good point.
Intolerance.
Can we be doing more?
I'd like to hear from each and every one of you about a time when prejudice has touched your lives.
Hello, everyone.
My name is Professor Barnes.
The class I'll be teaching this semester is introduction to lasers.
The word "laser" stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.
Where are the lasers?
This graphic here represents the electromagnetic spectrum arranged from low frequency He's not even using a laser pointer.
He's right.
This class stinks.
Stick with it.
You might learn something.
Uh, excuse me.
Professor?
Hi, there.
Andy Dwyer.
Curious.
When will you be bringing out the lasers for me to play with?
And will we start with the small lasers, or could we go just straight to the big lasers, in terms of playing with them?
We won't be using actual lasers in this course.
It's about the theory that makes them possible.
One of the most significant bummers of my lifetime.
First up, a personal favorite, the Sopranos option.
Now, I guarantee you, anyone that sees this logo is not gonna "fugghedaboudit".
This is our current community center.
Ugh.
This is our new community center!
That's right, it looks like an apple store.
Today, I'm a Beverly hills plastic surgeon, and the Parks department is a wrinkly old housewife in her early 30s.
I'm about to work a miracle.
Thank you, ma'am.
What a story.
Anyone else?
Anyone Uh, this gentleman wants to say something.
No, I don't.
Come on, Mel.
You're always up in arms about something.
No, I'm not.
I'm not always up in arms about something.
There we go.
That's the spirit.
Talk to me about what's bothering you.
Okay, that'll do it.
Thanks, everybody.
I once hosted a forum about a new bike rack that lasted seven hours.
Now when I need these people to complain, they're done in 45 minutes?
Whoa, check it out.
You can get credit for playing intramural frisbee golf.
Okay, you can take a class on the Civil War.
Why would I take a class on something that's already happened?
Look, you guys have already had your say.
Now I want to try something that I want to try.
And I'm gonna make my choice as I always do, at random.
As she was burned at the stake, Joan of Arc did not cower.
She did not beg for mercy.
she said, in a strong, clear voice, "I am not afraid.
I was born to do this".
I want to be burned at the stake.
Many societal institutions were established solely to oppress women.
To this day, some feminists have even condemned marriage as a glorified form of slavery.
Amen.
That class was awesome.
I wholeheartedly agree.
If that woman weren't so violently opposed to marriage, I think I would propose to her.
Well, then, it's decided.
Andy Dwyer will be taking "women's lasers".
"Women's studies".
Sorry.
God, I cannot stop thinking about lasers.
"Women's studies".
Is there such thing as "women's lasers"?
That'd be my number one pick.
Excuse me, what the heck is going on here?
Just preparing for the grand opening of this tiny but very intrusIVE park.
We were told this would have very little impact on the neighborhood.
This flyer has hundreds of events.
There are fireworks every night at midnight?
They start at midnight.
Who knows when they're gonna end?
Look, I don't even know the impact of this park, because the city skipped an environmental impact report.
So we don't know about traffic problems or sound or lights or crime.
I mean, it's all a mystery.
Don't you work for the government?
I do, Joe.
Yeah, that's how I know just how high this conspiracy goes.
What can we do about it?
I'm glad you asked.
I have some ideas.
These are our current park rangers.
What are they up to?
No one cares.
They're boring, and I hate them.
But coming this spring to the style network Ranger Reality Show.
I'm sorry, tom, but Chris, he just wanted us I mean, really, you've gone way off track.
Well, guess what, Jerry?
I'm a dreamer.
Okay?
I dream big.
Deal with it.
Tom, weekends are for dreaming.
You are a government worker.
This is a government job.
Plus isn't dreaming big exactly what got you in trouble with your old company?
- Hey, where you going, Joe?
- Bathroom break.
No, get back over there.
I'll find you a bottle or something.
Where did all these people come from?
And why did they turn so quickly on this project?
Well, you know how it goes.
It only takes one nut job to get people riled up.
I hate to say this, but I think we're gonna have to do that environmental impact report.
They are explicitly demanding it.
Hey, everybody, listen up.
Uh, in response to your complaints, we are cancelling all of these disruptive events.
This park is just gonna be a quiet patch of grass, harming nobody.
Everybody cool?
Great.
Dream team.
Actually, Chris, I know you think that we're a dream team-- Dream team!
Yeah.
But we're not.
You see, Leslie here is a team of one.
And that might be a very good team, but she kind of steamrolls the rest of her team, me, to do whatever she wants.
Regardless of how the rest of her team, me, feels.
So I don't think we should work together anymore.
Wow.
That was very hard to hear.
So many negative words.
I just need to process this.
Okay, the dream team is dead.
But you guys had a great run.
Oh, and the park is open.
Yay!
Good job with that.
Hello ma'am, who is just as equal as man, I would like one ticket for, uh, women.
He would like to register for Women's studies.
Okay.
Here's the registration form.
Ooh!
And we'll need a check or money order for $940.
Why?
Why didn't you tell me it was so expensive?
I didn't know.
My parents pay for my classes.
I'll just have them pay for yours too.
Oh, God, no!
That's embarrassing.
I know.
I'm gonna beg for money in the street like a drug addict.
- No.
- Yeah.
Oh my God.
Everything in my life is going wrong right now.
Whose fault is this?
I demand to know.
Actually-- Ben thinks that I'm a steamroller?
That's unbelievable.
How dare he think that I'm a steamroller?
Leslie, I'm just telling you this-- I know, he's going through a phase right now, and eventually we're gonna both be friends again.
No, what I was gonna say is that you really are-- Working too hard.
I know, Ann, you keep starting all these sentences and not finishing-- You're a steamroller!
You are a massive, enormous, runaway steamroller with no brakes and a cement brick on the gas pedal.
You made me watch all eight Harry Potter movies.
I don't even like Harry Potter.
That's insane.
You love Harry Potter.
You've seen all eight movies!
When we go out to a bar, you order my drinks for me.
Because you order white wine, and it gives you a headache.
Well, it's my headache!
Leslie, you do what you want, you ignore what other people want, and you hear only what you want to hear.
Okay.
I know.
I know I do this.
I'm the worst.
No, you're very passionate.
You just push too hard sometimes.
Well, you should call me a bulldozer rather than a steamroller.
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be okay.
Is it?
Honestly, is it?
I mean, I guess I just need to leave Ben alone.
That's what he says he wants.
Okay.
Well, this steamroller is hangin' up her The rolly thing on the front of the machine.
What do you-- what do you call that?
- The roller?
- Probably.
Okay.
Got you a little pick-me-up, Tommy.
A triple-decker ham and cheese from the cafeteria.
Always makes me feel better.
Two pathetic guys eating pathetic sandwiches.
Sounds terrific.
I guess I'm Jerry now.
After work, I'll just go home, straight to my boring house, kiss my wife, and have a home-cooked meal with my three beautiful daughters.
What a miserable life.
I have been here, well, 30-some years, and the best way to cope with this job is to do everything the exact same way every day.
Heck, I still use my original I.D. Card from my first day on the job.
Check this out.
Oh, my God.
I got to go.
Put my sammie in the fridge.
Mouse Rat CD, $30.
Candy bars, $50.
$50.
God, people here are so cheap.
April, where have you been?
Over two phone calls came in unimpeded.
We're raising money for my college education, Ron.
I took a second job back at my old job.
Do you want a shoe shine?
It's $100.
Laugh all you want, Kyle.
I already took the money out of your wallet.
Oh.
Good news, son.
You have just won a Ron Swanson scholarship.
I don't think so.
I don't remember applying for-- No, An--Andy.
Ron Swanson Scholarship.
Wait, are you serious?
Stop this.
No.
Stop, or you lose the money.
Why not?
I like the kid, and I have the money.
One thing I promised myself when I buried gold in my backyard was that I'd never be a hoarder or a miser about it.
Hey.
Okay, is this health department business or Leslie business?
You need to go talk to her.
Why?
So she can force me to spend time with her again?
No.
No way.
I'm done talking.
Listen, I know she can be strong-willed and difficult, okay?
She once made me eat an entire cheesecake at a potluck so she didn't look bad.
But I really think she's ready to listen.
You ate an entire cheesecake?
Why didn't you just throw it away?
Because with everything she's done for me, I would eat ten cheesecakes for her.
Also, P.S., it was delicious and amazing, like everything she does.
Will you please just talk to her?
For my sake?
I don't have unlimited texting, and when she can't talk to you, she texts me.
So we take the old logo from the 1970s, and we make limited-edition hats, posters, t-shirts, everything.
People love limited editions, plus parents will get swept up in the nostalgia and want to go to the parks to recreate the fun they had growing up.
This is amazing.
It is possibly the best idea anyone has had in this government in 100 years.
Tom, terrific.
Thanks, but most of the credit goes to my number-four, Jerry.
He shared some words of wisdom with me today, and while he was yammering on about whatever, I happened to see his old I.D. Card.
Thanks, buddy.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I wasn't sure you were gonna come.
Well, I got very curious when you only left me one voicemail message, instead of your usual 20.
I'm trying to be a little less intense and a little more considerate.
Here, have a seat.
But only if you want to.
Okay.
I want to.
I never listened to what you wanted, or how you wanted us to be when things Ended between us.
I just decided what I wanted, and I got upset when you didn't want the same thing.
I know that's not fair, and I'm very sorry.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.
If you don't want to have any more contact with me, I finally understand.
I--I don't want that.
Really.
But I just think it's for the best.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
There is another option.
We could just say "screw it" and do this thing for real.
What?
I miss you like crazy.
I think about you all the time.
I want to be with you.
So let's just say "screw it".
No, we would have to tell Chris.
Yeah.
It could turn into a scandal.
- Yeah.
- It could hurt your campaign.
I mean, how would you imagine we do this?
I don't know.
But I--I know how I feel, and I want to be with you.
But I'm done steamrolling people.
This is how I feel.
How do you feel?
First day.
You ready?
As ready as I'll ever be.
Oh, crap, I forgot my books.
And my computer.
Just pay attention to the lecture and enjoy.
My first day of college, my father dropped me off at the steel mill.
He didn't think I should go to college.
But I hitched a ride, enrolled, and learned a lot.
I hope Andy does too.
We need to start teaching women football, teaching women U.F.C., teaching them to drive trucks without crashing.
"Hey, maybe I'm only sexy.
"Then--maybe that's all you see, "but at least you can give me extra money.
"Tip money and stuff.
I'll flirt with you, write my name on a napkin".
They're gonna do it in a right, kind of legal way that empowers prostitution.
We don't rest until we get that.
That will be progress.
That is extremely incorrect.
I thought-- I thought maybe it was when I was-- I, uh-- I'll get 'em next time.
Back to you, Professor.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
April!
Listen, I was trying to buy this hand-crafted mahogany wood model of a B-25 Mitchell Panchito aircraft.
- Aw, for me?
- Don't sass me.
And I went to this website, and this ad popped up that said "Hey, Ron Swanson!
Check out this great offer".
What's your question?
My question is, what the hell?
Like, how did they know who you are?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Um, there are these things called cookies, where, like you go to a site and buy something, it'll remember you and then create ads for other stuff you might want to buy.
So it learns information?
About me?
That seems like an invasion of privacy.
Dude, if you think that's bad, go to Google Earth and type in your address.
The point is, Ben and I have been dating on and off for about a year.
I am, of course, shocked And not just because Ben usually prefers tall brunettes.
We're very sorry for the position this puts you in.
What's happening?
Are you hugging me, or are we fighting?
Are you hugging or fighting?
Let me know.
Neither of those things.
I love both of you.
You are exemplary government employees.
"Exemplary"?
That's the word we were thinking of.
- Well, it's true.
- Isn't it?
Which makes what I'm about to say even sadder.
Then don't say it.
I'm launching a full investigation into the extent of your wrongdoing.
Please report Monday first thing to the council chambers for your ethics trial and subsequent punishment.
I told you we'd feel better.
Hey.
It's 6:30 in the morning.
Your hearing doesn't start for another two hours.
Well, I wanted to get here early, you know, get a feel of the room.
- So you got here-- - 3:00 A.M. I couldn't sleep anyway.
Well, I wanted to sneak in before you got here-- an absurd pipe dream I now realize was impossible.
Is that a present for me?
Yeah.
What do you think?
Li'l Sebastian.
Yeah, I had him made for you at the toy store.
Aw, thank you so much for making my life so wonderful.
- You're welcome.
- I was talking to him.
- Of course.
- But also to you.
Thanks.
I wish we could go through this together.
Look, it's going to be okay.
You're just gonna get a slap on the wrist, maybe a brief suspension.
That's not okay.
That's gonna go on my permanent record.
I'm not the kind of person that has a permanent record.
For me, a slap on the wrist is like a kick to the nuts.
I know it is.
What's gonna happen to you?
Don't worry about me.
Well, look, I'll be outside all day, right on the other side of that wall.
So, if you miss me, you just look at this Wrinkled, hideous monster and you'll know I'm sitting there - rooting for you, okay?
- Okay.
All right.
- Go.
- Okay.
Marcus Everett Langley was Pawnee's greatest lawyer at the turn of the century.
His nickname was "Old Stone Face" because of his steely demeanor and because he got in an accident at the rock quarry and dynamite blew up his face.
Leslie Knope!
Good morning!
It is snowing outside.
Isn't that great?
You seem like you're in a good mood.
Actually, I'm quite miserable.
I admire and respect you, and dragging you through an ethics trial is filling me with sadness.
I have never felt so low.
Well, you're radiating pure joy.
I went to my herbalist and got two B-12 shots.
And then I ate an unreasonable amount of St. John's wort, and my herbalist took this weird bee pollen paste rubbed it around my gums.
And now my mouth feels like a spaceship.
This is stressful.
And stress leads to depression.
And if I don't mantain an extremely high dosages of herbal remedies, I will get very depressed.
Oh, God.
It's happening right now.
We are here today to determine whether Leslie Knope violated any municipal rules or laws due to her romantic relationship with her superior Ben Wyatt, whose hearing will be held tomorrow.
Would you like to make a statement at this time?
Yes.
I freely admit to the relationship, and I will not be fighting the charges that we violated Chris' rule.
But we did nothing else wrong or unethical.
In 1849, Sarah Nelson Quindle exposed her elbow outdoors, which was a class "A" felony.
Although she felt the law unjust, she acknowledged that she had broken it, and she nobly accepted her punishment-- to be set adrift on Lake Michigan like a human popsicle.
Look how calm she looks.
That's how I feel-- totally zen.
Ms. Knope, on what day did your relationship with Ben Wyatt begin?
Last May, at your request, Ben and I drove to Indianapolis to bid for the state little league tournament.
The night we returned was the first time we kissed each other on each other's mouths.
It was excellent.
That was unnecessary to add.
I'm sorry.
I'm nervous.
Next question-- did you ever receive special treatment as a result of your relationship with Ben Wyatt?
I received adorable nicknames and amazing back rubs.
Oh, you mean professionally.
No.
And did you break any local, state, or federal law in an effort to cover up your relationship with Ben Wyatt?
Absolutely not.
Thank you.
Ms. Knope, that is all.
Mr. Traeger, this says you're gonna be calling 14 witnesses.
Is that correct?
Uh, yes, sir.
Why so many?
I've already admitted that I broke your rule.
It's not my rule, Leslie.
It is an important rule that exists in every government.
Romantic relationships between superiors and their employees lead to fraud, corruption, and misuse of public funds.
And you think I'm guilty of that?
I think that you began your relationship with Ben Wyatt earlier than you're saying.
I believe that you certainly received special treatment, and I think that you may even be guilty of bribery.
None of those things are true.
And I will prove it, Mr. Traeger.
Okay, ten-minute break please.
Here you go, boss.
Okay, guys, we need to counter every charge that Chris has leveled against me.
- Andy, I need evidence.
- Got it!
Wait!
You don't know what evidence.
Ah, right on.
Yes.
Hit me.
Next to my desk is a picture of a female politician-- Bella Abzug.
Get the key that's taped to the back of that picture.
It opens up my bottom desk drawer in there are some files-- pay attention.
Where are you looking?
Look here, focus here.
Get the files in the drawer, and then get all the file boxes in the office.
Put the files in the drawer.
Let's go.
- No.
- Okay, I'll go with him.
Thank you.
Ron, Chris has 14 witnesses.
I need you to talk to all the department heads and find out who's gonna testify.
I don't know the names of the other department heads.
I'll go with him.
Seriously?
With the men in this office?
- Ann?
- Yeah?
I need you to text me every 30 seconds - that everything's gonna be okay.
- Okay.
Thanks, Ann!
I broke one rule, and I will accept a slap on the wrist.
But when you sit back and let your reputation be destroyed.
You go down in history as a frozen whore.
I'm fighting.
Hey, grab my computer.
I'm all set.
- Great.
You're up next.
- How is Ben?
Is he sad?
- You need to cheer him up, Ann.
- Ben is fine.
He says he's sorry he's not in here.
He said to look at the monster.
I'm hoping you know what that means.
There's a rumor going around that Chris has a killer witness.
How?
Why?
That makes no sense.
There's no killer witness, because we didn't do anything wrong-- unless someone's planning to lie or slander us.
Okay, just to be safe, find out who it is and silence him.
- With pleasure.
- Wait.
Let me make it clear.
Don't silence him.
Just make sure he can't talk.
Okay, we're back.
Clear this chamber, please.
Ms. Perkins, Chris Traeger has questioned when my relationship with Ben Wyatt began.
I'd like to direct you to your inbox and specifically an email entitled "yay".
That's Y-A and 18 "Y"s and 44 exclamation points.
Yes, it is an email from you.
Oh, and there's an attachment.
Mm.
Intriguing.
Could you play the attachment, please?
Sure.
In a world on the brink of financial meltdown In a town unlike any other An adorable man with a cute face and the future president of the United States-- what?
-- went from being friends to being so much more.
Ann!
Ben and I hooked up last night!
Aah!
And I learned how to use iMovie.
Call me later!
Bye!
So what was the date you received that email?
- Uh, May 12th.
- May 12th The day after we returned from Indianapolis.
Mr. Haverford, would you consider Leslie Knope a good employee?
Did Tom Ford turn around the House of Gucci?
I do not know, but I'll assume that that is a yes.
How long were you two lovers?
- Excuse me?
- Oh, God.
Last march, I witnessed Leslie Knope and Tom Haverford engaged in a passionate yet tender kiss.
It seems that Ms. Knope has a pattern of becoming involved with her co-workers.
Tom, will you please tell the committee why we were kissing?
An online dating site randomly paired us up.
So, as a joke, I thought it would be funny to pretend you and I were dating.
And then you kissed me as a joke To shut me up.
But we never had any other romantic contact after that.
No, that would be like dating my older sister's elderly aunt.
No, it wouldn't.
Well, we've been at it for hours.
And I did have some problem with my character witnesses.
I don't know why Leslie Knope's on trial.
Ethel Beavers did it!
- Beavers did it!
- Sit down.
I will hold myself in contempt of the court!
Is this about the laptop?
I didn't mean to steal it.
I took it home, and I spaced.
I forgot.
I'm gonna bring it back.
It totally works, but I got spaghetti in the keyboard.
What laptop?
Objection.
But other than that, I think I'm winning.
I've refuted every one of Chris' claims so far.
I have here a receipt from Pawnee Supersuites Motel.
Leslie Knope submitted that receipt for reimbursement.
Taxpayers' money is not meant to be spent on a romantic getaway.
Donna, will you please describe what we were wearing the evening you saw us?
Um, khakis and button-down shirts-- your basic white people clothes.
And when you walked into the room, what did it look like?
Did it look like anything romantic had happened?
Oh, hell, no.
I have ruined my share of hotel rooms, and trust me, nothing sexual happened in that room.
It kind of looked like an office.
Maybe because it was an office.
City Hall was being fumigated, and we need to pull an all-nighter.
The only thing that was ravaged were these federal grant proposals that Donna had dropped off earlier.
I've seen over 200 episodes of Law & Order, and it's paying off big-time.
And by the way, we got the gramps-- grants.
God!
Oh.
It was gonna be such an awesome moment.
So, Ethel, you've been to a million of these ethics trials.
- What do you think my chances are?
- I'd say it's 50/50.
You want to put money on it, I'll give you 60/40 against.
Is it ethical for a court stenographer to bet on the outcome of a hearing?
You tell me.
You're the one on trial.
Ron Swanson to the stand, please.
Mr. Swanson, there has been a question posed about when my relationship with Ben Wyatt ended.
Can you confirm that you own a cabin - at 930-- - Ah!
Stop, please.
I don't like to give out my address to anyone, much less have it on an official record.
Ron, don't be ridiculous.
This is very important.
- Do you own a cabin-- - Ah!
- 9301 Cedarcrest Dr-- - Beep!
I didn't hear that.
She's here.
Who's here?
My ex-wife--Tammy two.
I can smell the sulfur coming off her cloven hooves.
Good nose, Ron.
Tammy Swanson is here.
She'll be my next witness.
Tammy two is your killer witness?
Please!
You're gonna have to do better-- Actually, she is a terrifying sociopath who could say or do anything-- A pretty good killer witness.
Ms. Swanson, do you, as you claimed, have evidence linking Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt to law breaking?
Absolutely.
I have several photographs that will definitively prove-- May I remind you that you are under oath, and if you lie, I will fire you and have you prosecuted.
Nothing.
They will definitively prove nothing.
You cut me off.
I don't have any evidence.
Oh, Chris-- so silly.
Okay, bye, guys.
Leslie, have fun with this trial.
Yay!
I think I've proven that the only rule Ben and I broke was dating each other.
And I am very happy that I have not uncovered any additional evidence of unethical behavior.
But I-I do have one last witness-- George Williams from Public Works.
George Williams?
Who's-- Oh, George Williams-- He's just a maintenance worker, NASCAR enthusiast, I believe.
And, oh, interesting tidbit-- I once bribed him to keep my relationship with Ben quiet.
You're saying that you saw Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope kissing at Li'l Sebastian's memorial?
Yeah!
Can you identify Leslie Knope in this chamber?
- She's right there.
- Right-- And what happened after this incident?
Well, I got real nervous.
They came up to me, and they told me to forget what I saw.
What you saw was not what you think it is.
I have a gift certificate, actually, for you.
Oh, my God.
And then they gave me a $50 gift certificate to a spa and said And thank you for your discretion.
- And did you use it?
- Yeah.
I got a facial.
My wife said my skin was luminous.
That's enough.
Now, in order to cover up their illicit affair, Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope bribed a city employee.
George, I notice that you're wearing glasses, yet on the day in question, I don't recall you wearing glasses.
Could it be because you weren't wearing glasses?
I never wear 'em on the job.
Can you take your glasses off, please, and read this for us?
"I could read this if I weren't so blind".
Well, that went terribly.
I need to check some facts and figures.
I would like to request a 55-day recess.
You can have 30 minutes, but we're nearing the end here, Ms. Knope.
Okay, guys, my only hope is that in one of these old books, there's some weird, arcane statute or government rule that helps me.
So everybody grab a volume, and let's just read up.
Okay, mine doesn't have any pictures.
Does anyone have anything?
Did anybody find anything good?
In 1856, the city council banned all sexual positions except for missionary.
And two years later, they banned missionary.
speak out of turn, he may be caned across the shinbone.
Oh, my God.
Black people still can't legally use city sidewalks.
Look, I know we're not supposed to be seen together, but I think Ben could be really helpful with this.
- Can somebody go get him?
- All right, I'll go.
"Any woman caught laughing is a witch".
That's true.
Um, he's not there.
No, he said he'd just be on the other side of that wall.
- He's probably in the bathroom.
- All right, I'll find him.
This mural is called Bad Pawnee, Good Pawnee.
All the terrible things that have happened in this town's history are on one side.
And on the other side are all the good things that have happened.
I'm on the bad side.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am, Ron.
I'm guilty.
I did something bad.
I'm a bad person.
It's not that simple.
You know what makes a good person good?
When a good person does something bad, they own up to it.
They try to learn something from it, and they move on.
Guys, everybody stop reading-- no more loopholes, no more fighting.
Are you sure, boss?
Yeah.
I know I let you down.
And I just want to say I'm really sorry.
Leslie, what are you talking about?
Yeah, this makes me like you more.
Bribing someone to hide a sexcapade-- I'm proud to call you a friend.
And I always liked you.
Okay, we're back.
Clear the chamber, please.
I think I'm about to get fired, Ron.
Ms. Knope, unless you have any objections, we'll be ending this investigation and moving on to the punishment phase.
I have no objections.
We hereby hand down the following judgment.
You will be suspended for two weeks with pay.
- Just two weeks?
- Correct.
This concludes the investigation.
I thought I was gonna get fired.
I should've gotten fired.
Why didn't I get fired?
Ben asked for a private meeting with the committee, and he took full responsibility for the bribe and resigned, effective immediately.
What?
Wait.
Hang on.
You can't let him resign.
I tried to talk him out of it, but His mind was made up.
Look, my job is to protect the government from fraud and corruption.
I was just doing my job.
I hope that you can understand that.
I do.
Honestly, I do.
'Cause your actions wounded me to my core, which is not easy since the bulk of my workouts are focused on core strengthening.
But we will get through this.
You are An excellent government employee.
And more importantly, you're the only person I've ever met who's worthy of being Ben's girlfriend.
I hope that's true.
You know, the meeting that Ben and I had-- it's on the record.
You should take a look at the last page of the transcript.
"Mr. Wyatt: Chris, for God's sake, "would you mind not jumping for a while"?
Mr. Traeger: "Sorry, Ben, but" This is how I fight depression.
Okay, fine.
I'll stop.
Thank you.
Okay, so you are prepared to resign, effective immediately, and take full responsibility for all the events that transpired at Li'l Sebastian's memorial.
- "Mr. Wyatt: That is correct".
- That is correct.
"Mr. Traeger: Okay, fine.
"This makes me sadder than I previously thought "humanly possible, but I accept your resignation.
Can I ask you one more question"?
Was all of this-- all the sneaking around, the scandal, losing your job-- Was it worth it?
Yes.
It was.
"Because I love Leslie.
I want to be with her.
"And I don't want to hide "the way I feel about her anymore.
"So, yeah, it was worth it, "because I'm in love with Leslie Knope.
"Mr. Traeger: That was beautiful.
"I'm literally crying and jumping.
"Crying noise, crying noise, nose blow.
"Mr. Wyatt: It's gonna be okay.
Mr. Traeger:" Oh.
Let it out, I guess.
"End transcript".
Hi, honey, how was your day?
Oh, I've had better.
How about you?
I can't believe you did that for me.
Well, I was pretty sure it was gonna happen one way or the other.
I hope it doesn't affect your campaign.
Don't worry about that right now.
There was a piece of testimony that came out during the trial that I think you'd be interested in.
Ethel?
Ethel, could you please read page 132 of the official testimony?
"Ethel Beavers: The official record "has now annoyingly been reopened "so that Leslie Knope can make a statement.
"Leslie Knope: Let the record state that I, Leslie Knope, "love Ben Wyatt.
"I love him with all of my heart.
"Did you get that?
Ethel Beavers: Yes, I got it".
Thank you, Ethel.
Can I get a ride home?
It's freezing.
Can you please state your name for the committee?
- Gary Gergich.
- Oh, God, Jerry.
You can't even get your own name right.
Actually, my real name is Gary.
Gary?
On my first day here, the old director-- he called me Jerry, and I just didn't think I should correct him.
That's ridiculous.
Your name is Jerry.
No.
Legally my name is Gary.
Gary Gergich?
Jerry Gergich.
Gary Gergich.
Jerry Gergich.
Gary Gergich.
Jerry-- God, they're both horrible.
But Jerry's better.
I'm gonna call you Jerry.
Okay, Jerry, do you remember a time I'm sorry.
I can't get over the Gary/Jerry thing.
Neither can I. Jerry, you can go.
We need a five-minute break.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Come on, come on, come on.
- Leslie Knope!
- Hey, Chris!
Wow, is that a new jogging shirt?
It is!
It's an experimental fabric called bumble-flex.
It's made out of synthetic bees' wings.
- That's cool.
- Anyway You're not supposed to be here.
You're suspended.
I totally understand that.
I'm just going to, uh, take my flash drive and I'll do some work from home.
N O. You are specifically prohibited from doing your job.
Oh, I'm not gonna do my job.
I'm just gonna oversee the department, and check in on the parks, and attend any meetings that require - the deputy director.
- Leslie.
Go home and give me the flash drive.
This is a nasal spray.
Give me the flash drive.
Give me the nasal spray.
On three.
One - Two - Two Three.
Okay, good.
Now, in two weeks, you can-- Leslie Knope!
I am much faster than you!
I have bumble-flex!
It's so nice to be able to sit here in public - and have breakfast with you.
- Yeah.
In a way, my suspension from work was kind of a blessing.
Yeah, I feel the same way about resigning in disgrace.
Totally, the key is you have to keep yourself busy, or else you're gonna go crazy.
I mean, look at me, look how busy I am.
I'm inventing a new spice called "sal-gar".
It's part salt, part sugar.
What could that possibly be good on?
- Butterscotch pudding.
- Fair enough.
Okay, I have to go to this meeting with my advisers.
You have a big day, right?
Which interview is this?
It's a job doing in-house accounting work for an accounting firm, so could be pretty interesting.
Yeah, sounds interesting.
You know, if I hadn't resigned in disgrace, I might never have explored the private sector.
It's like, why didn't I resign in disgrace 12 years ago?
You might want to stop saying "resigned in disgrace".
Especially during job interviews.
Good call.
Leslie wishes she could be here herself to give you these presents, but she's suspended.
Oh, and also she said that they're not from her, - they're from Santa Claus.
- Can I go first?
Mouse Rat, certified gold!
Over 100 copies sold in Pawnee!
I need to get a picture of me holding this so I can frame it.
Personalized, leopard-printed robe.
Pink feather cuffs.
And on the back, in rhinestones "You can get it"!
I know you're sad you couldn't get tickets to the "Watch the Throne" tour, so I got you a watch and a tiny throne instead.
And check it out, she even took out the dumb clock part and put this in "Baller Time".
These are the Black-eyed Peas.
And I finally killed them.
It's a Christmas miracle.
Every year, I give Leslie the same present I give everyone: A crisp $20 bill.
And every year, she gets me something thoughtful and personal.
It makes me furious.
This year, she outdid herself.
She had it installed over the weekend.
It's so-- It's so beautiful.
We need to get Leslie something that erases the enormous emotional debt that has built up over years of this gift-giving imbalance.
Everyone start thinking of ideas.
Aw, jeez.
Socks.
She gets me.
Hi, hi, hi, hi.
Sorry I'm late.
I was off getting holiday gifts for my team.
William, here is a Knope 2012 tree ornament.
- Hey.
- And Elizabeth, I got you a Knope 2012 MenorahMaybe?
- No.
- No, okay.
Then I got you a tree ornament.
Okay, so let's talk about damage control.
Now, I could go on Pawnee Today, but-- and I know this is a long shot-- Oprah has her own network now.
- Whoa, Leslie, slow down.
- The first step is for us to figure out what we're up against, and we've already got polls out in the field, and we should have results back in a couple of days.
Just stay out of the spotlight until we can figure out just how this, uh, incident has affected the voters.
Sit tight, take a beat, relax.
"Sit tight"?
"Take a beat"?
"Relax"?
I don't really do any of those things.
In fact, while I was in that meeting, I was also planning my mother's birthday party in my head.
Strawberry margaritas!
Another use for sal-gar!
Financial analysis, automated general ledger accounting systems, audit management.
Hmm, you've done everything.
Well, they call me "the Swiss Army Accountant".
- They don't call me that.
- They should.
Well, look, I think you'd be a great addition.
Would you be willing to come back to meet the division head?
Yes, absolutely.
- We'll set that up.
- Okay, great.
- Thank you.
- Well, uh Calc-you-later.
Oh, you like that one, huh?
We do not get a lot of humor here, and when we do, it's wonderful.
- Oh.
- Ted!
Come in here!
Say it to Ted when he comes in.
We could get Leslie some marshmallow fluff.
I have some right here.
Correction, darling.
You had some right here.
Did you just scoop it out of the jar with your hand like a bear?
Yes.
I can't get it off.
Can you help me?
Behold!
My latest attempt to drag this department into the 20th century.
- Tom, it's the 21st century.
- I know.
I'd settle for getting you into the 20th.
I fed all of Leslie's emails, letters, and memos into a program and generated A word cloud.
This is how we can get gift ideas.
The more she's mentioned a word, the larger it appears.
"Ben" And much larger, "Ann".
- She definitely loves Ann.
- Aww.
Okay.
I have an idea.
I will build a small wood model of the parks department.
We can decorate our offices as they are in real life.
It will be - Cute.
- Wait!
Better idea: We make a gingerbread version of the office.
- That's so good!
- I think the wood model is-- and we can decorate our offices with candy canes and gumdrops!
That would be so adorable!
Thanks, Ron!
That's such a cute idea!
I have some great red birch with a nice spalting.
I already have some scale wainscoting.
Mmm, I love me a calzone.
Ben!
I'm going crazy!
First, they won't let me work in the parks department, now they won't let me campaign either.
All I want to do is improve our town, and they won't let me do that!
You're putting an awful lot of sal-gar on your pasta.
This is just sugar.
Okay, I need you to distract me.
Talk to me about something.
Anything.
Well, that accounting firm is gonna make me a job offer.
Oh, yeah?
That's great!
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna take it?
Well, it pays well.
The commute is a little long, but that's okay.
I didn't love the carpeting, but eh.
You know what I think?
If you don't love it, take a month.
See what else is out there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And, you know, you can still improve the city.
You can't work right now, or run a campaign.
- Do it as a private citizen.
- Oh, my God.
I'll form a citizen action committee, I'll lobby from the outside, I'll harness the power of the community.
Oh, my God, I finally have some work to do.
Thank you so much for dinner, honey.
I can hear you breathing, and, yes, you can finish her pasta.
Thank God.
I'm so hungry.
Mmm, it tastes like froot loops.
Wow!
Great turn out.
Okay, welcome everyone to the first meeting of the Parks Committee of Pawnee, or PCP.
Um, should we really be called "PCP"?
- See, because-- - Yes, because, like the drug PCP, we are so fast-acting and powerful, we should be illegal.
Now, what do you want to see fixed in the parks?
Yes?
I've noticed that the White Hills hiking path could really use some upkeep.
I was thinking we organize a letter-writing campaign.
Uh, I-I know for a fact that nobody in the parks department reads letters, except for one person, who is amazing, but s-he isn't currently there, because he was suspended.
How amazing can he be if he got suspended?
Pretty damn amazing, Diane.
Now shush.
If we want to get the government off their bloated, bureaucratic butts, then we need our voices to be heard, and that's what we're gonna do.
Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose.
Ron is making the model, and then we're going to put all of our candy decorations in our corners of the office.
Okay, so what did everybody make?
Boom!
Rock n' roll candy Andy.
Wow.
- Mmm.
- That's really good, son.
I didn't do anything for my office.
It's okay, I took care of it.
I made a marshmallow Ron Swanson.
See?
His arms are crossed because he's mad at all the other marshmallow workers for annoying him.
You like it?
It's fine.
When I was trying to decide how to decorate my office, I had to ask myself, "what kind of candy should I choose"?
Obviously chocolate, 'cause I'm sweet, smooth, and the ladies love me.
Now the question still remained, "what kind of chocolate am I"?
Do I have a little gooey, caramel center?
Am I filled with little rice krispies?
Maybe I'm white chocolate and I'm bucking all the stereotypes.
Oh, just put your damn candy out.
Ultimately, I decided to go with a little gourmet fudge.
I didn't have time to make it into anything, and please don't eat it 'cause it cost $55 an ounce.
So I made my desk out of silver m&ms.
But they do not make silver m&ms, so I spray-painted them.
Okay, those are poisonous, so no one eat them.
Yeah, duh.
- Go throw up.
- I didn't eat any.
- Go throw up.
- Throw up.
- Ben Wyatt.
- Hi.
- Great to meet you.
- You too.
I'm, uh, this.
Well, thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Feinstein.
Please, call me Dennis Feinstein.
I'm gonna cut right to the chase, Ben.
This cologne company is my life's work.
Why should I trust you with my perfumery?
Well, uh, I've been in government accounting for more than a decade, and I just think it's time for a change.
Listen, Ben, I'm gonna cut right to the chase, okay?
I like you-- I've always liked you-- but I also like Eddie.
Ed--who--who's Eddie?
Eddie's my current CFO, but I might fire him and hire you.
- You got kids?
- No.
That's good.
Dum-dum Eddie has two kids.
Oh, God.
Don't fire Eddie.
Why would you have him in here in this interview?
- Eddie, I am sorry-- - Don't talk to Eddie.
Treat him like you would treat a person in another country that you paid $25,000 to hunt.
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?
I'm talking about the best vacation of my life.
Oh, my God.
Look, I'm sorry.
I-I thought I wanted to branch out a little career-wise, but that was a mistake.
Keep Eddie.
I do not want this job.
You're crazy, man.
We'll be in touch.
Okay, are there any more recommendations for new games at the rec center?
My daughter, she loves chutes and ladders.
Oh, come on!
There is no strategy to chutes and ladders.
- It's just luck.
- My daughter's five.
Well, your daughter is an idiot.
Her daughter is an idiot!
He daughter is an idiot!
- No, no, no.
- Her daughter is an idiot!
No, no she's not.
Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I represent the PCP.
We have a list of six demands.
Here they are in alphabetical order.
Number one: Ants.
Too many ants in the teen center.
Number two: Tennis court improvements.
- Number three-- - Well, Les--um, ma'am, uh, this public forum, it is just about improvements that we can make to the rec center.
Speaking of which, the fact that yahtzee is not in the rec center is a tragedy on par with human trafficking.
Slight exaggeration Getting back to our demands.
We will not be muzzled like a rabid dog.
We are gonna take this all the way to the top.
Yay!
Okay, we have made some waves here, people, but we need to keep this momentum going.
Now, the city manager's name is Chris Traeger.
I want to take this fight to him.
Ooh, a letter-writing campaign!
God, Diane, will you stop it with the letter-writing campaign?
No.
I have his office number.
I want one of you calling it every 15 minutes.
We are also going to protest along his jogging route, and I need someone in every GNC within a five-mile radius - of the city center.
- But there are only 12 of us.
- 13.
- Look!
Our numbers are growing!
There's nothing we can't do if we work hard, never sleep, and shirk all other responsibilities in our lives.
You with me?
I can handcraft 17-foot canoes out of western red cedar, but I can't glue two damn Graham crackers together!
Look, it's really easy.
I know a lot about candy.
I play with it, I eat it.
Sometimes I play with it and eat it.
Boom!
Okay, new plan.
Everyone else makes this candy house, and I make myself useful elsewhere.
Your 11:00 is here.
Concerned citizen and community leader Leslie Knope.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Leslie.
You're not supposed to be here.
As a government employee, that's true, but I am just here as a concerned citizen and founder of PCP.
The Parks Committee of Pawnee.
Those are the people that have been harassing me.
We have many demands.
Specifically, these six unfunded projects that need to be dealt with immediately.
- Well-- - Not good enough!
Leslie, out of respect for you, I will meet with your group, but I hope that this puts an end to the madness.
Prepare for battle.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, I got your Christmas present.
It's like a little stopwatch that records your jogging times and then sends it to your computer via Bluetooth.
Ahh!
- That is so thoughtful!
- Aww.
My pleasure.
See you in hell!
Well, I see you've taken our advice about relaxing.
Oh, this is just a little militant citizen group I slapped together.
But enough about me, what are my polling results?
Uh, well, before the scandal, you were at 26%.
Now, we knew we'd take a hit, but we figured as long as we're at 15% or above, we're still in the fight.
And we're at 15%?
We went back to 26%?
Whoa, wait.
We're at one.
One hundred?
You're polling at 1%.
What?
No.
That can't be right.
Okay, well, what we do is we move forward from this.
How do we put a positive spin on this?
- There's no way to spin this.
- Sure there is.
You're looking at the glass like it's 99% empty.
I'm looking at it like it's 1% full.
You know, the last delicious sip of a milkshake at the bottom of the metal milkshakey thing?
It's very hard to come back from this kind of thing.
You know, a sex scandal with your boss.
Oh, like you're so pure and chaste.
Please, I know the two of you are sleeping together.
It's obvious, with all your glances and your sly smiles.
- I'm gay.
- Well, never mind then.
It's a small town.
There's nowhere to hide.
We can't run your campaign anymore.
I'm sorry, Leslie.
You were a great candidate, butit's over.
Could you maybe find new advisors?
I can't.
I talked to everyone in the entire state who's ever run a campaign.
Nobody wants a candidate who's polling - at "last milkshake sip" levels.
- Can I say something?
This sucks, I am not gonna convince you that it doesn't, and you can tell me every day for the next year - about how much this sucks.
- One year--you said one year.
- That's on the record.
- And I meant it.
But eventually this'll pass.
You're gonna get through this.
I don't know if I'm going to.
I mean, look, I return to my old job in a week, and that's great because I love my old job, but My heart was really set on this new job.
Ann.
Don't touch my pickles, Ann!
B-b-b-b-Ben-jammin'!
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
Hey, Jean-Ralphio.
How's it going?
It's going good, I'm actually right here for an appointmt.
Getting a Brazilian.
By the way, there's a woman over there that is unbelievable.
Her name is Kim.
When she rips it off, she smiles, and it makes you feel things.
Throw my name, I get a referral discount.
- If you don't mind.
- Okay.
I heard somebody resigned in disgrace.
My question to you is, how you making that paper?
Oh, well, I've interviewed around, uh, but I'm actually about to take a job doing in-house accounting - for an accounting firm.
- Buh I almost fell asleep during that sentence.
- Okay.
- Let me get this straight.
You would be an accountant - For accountants?
- Yeah.
So at this accounting firm, you would have the boring job?
Are you nuts?
This is probably the first time you've had off since you've been kid president.
- True or false?
- True.
Why don't you use that time and go after one of your passions, like model trains or, like, or toy Gandalfs or something?
I don't know why you jumped straight to model trains.
I mean it's accurate.
I'm gonna tell you something that I once heard from a very, - very smart woman named Kim.
- The lady who waxes you?
She told me, "if you don't love what you do Then why do it"?
Then she ripped the hair from my b-hole.
Ron filled me in on everything that happened, and I really wish that the ethics investigation hadn't interfered with your campaign in any way.
You don't have to apologize.
You were very fair.
In fact, I'm the one that needs to apologize.
I got you involved in PCP.
But I'm starting a new group now, LSD-- Leslie's Sorry Division-- and I just want to say I'm sorry, Chris.
Oh, that's nice of you to say.
Anyway, now, for your Christmas present.
Your suspension's been lifted.
Please, come back to work.
Thank you.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Hey.
Uh, I just wanted to tell you something in person.
Oh, my God, I'm pregnant.
Wait, what?
No, that's not it.
I turned down that accounting job.
Just didn't feel right.
That's okay, right?
Yeah.
I think that's great.
- I'm really proud of you.
- Yeah?
What are you gonna do instead?
- I have no idea.
- I like it.
Okay, well, I guess I'll just see you at home.
Well, they're having a party in here.
Why don't you stay?
Actually, I think you should go in alone.
- What's going on here?
- Merry Christmas, Leslie!
We made you this replica of the parks department out of gingerbread.
Oh, my God, I love it!
Aw, I love it, and I love you guys, and Ann specifically.
And all of you!
You did all of this together?
Yes, except for me.
Turns out, I cannot make a gingerbread house, which would bother me if I were an 8-year-old girl.
In any case, these people stepped up and helped me out, and that gave me another idea.
This is the city council chambers, and that's you, next may.
I don't understand.
Your campaign advisers quit, big deal.
You're running for city council again, Leslie, with our help.
April Ludgate, youth outreach and director of new media.
Tom Haverford, image consultant, swagger coach.
Ann Perkins, office manager and volunteer coordinator.
Andy Dwyer, security, sweets, body man.
Javelin, if need be.
Donna Meagle, transpo, AKA rides in my Benz.
W--you guys didn't tell me we were doing this.
I--I did not know that I was supposed to come up with something.
I-- Ron Swanson, any other damn thing you might need.
Guys, it's so much work.
I can't ask you to put your lives on hold.
Find one person here who you haven't helped by putting your life on hold.
I don't know what to say Except Let's go win an election!
Giving Christmas gifts is like a sport to me.
Finding or making that perfect something.
- Come on.
- It's also like a sport to me because I always win.
This year, though?
My friends won.
In fact, I got my ass handed to me.
- Welcome, Mr. Saperstein.
- Thank you so much.
I will just show to your cubicle.
I can't wait.
I bet it's a big one, - huh Barney?
- Um, the, uh, temp agency said that you are fluent with Quickbooks Pro, correct?
Oh, right, yeah, we should cover that.
You see, my resume might not actually be accurate, right?
So I have no idea what you're talking about.
Don't know what Quickbooks are.
You don't have any accounting experience?
No, no, no, Barney, come on.
But you don't have to be an accountant to know that this girl is a ten.
Yo, what up, D.S.?
You come here often?
To my job?
Ooh, she got a mouth on her also.
- Shut it.
- Is this the new temp who's supposed to help me with the spreadsheets?
You want to talk about spreading and sheets, we can go back to my place and I will rock your-- - You're fired!
- That makes sense.
So I just go out the same way I came in?
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Oh, goody, you're all here.
Now, I know I'm not supposed to talk about my campaign in the office, but last night I've made a decision about who should be my campaign manager.
This is a huge job.
This is going to require a lot of late night, one-on-one jam sessions with me, and we're going to bounce ideas off of each other, you're going to have to take calls for me, any time, day or night.
The person I have chosen is, drum roll please, Ann Perkins!
Yay!
Give it up for Ann!
Good choice.
Leslie, I don't know the first thing about running a political campaign.
Ann, you beautiful tropical fish.
You're smart as a whip and you're cool under pressure.
You've resuscitated a human heart in your bare hands.
No, I haven't.
- You haven't?
- No!
You will.
You're that good of a nurse.
What about Ben?
I mean, he ran for mayor at 18 and won.
Ben is poison in my campaign.
Our relationship is the reason why my advisors pulled out.
- I-- - Ann, don't listen to your head or your heart.
Just look at my eyes and say "yes".
- Okay, yes.
- Yes!
- I believe in you, Ann.
- Thank you.
And your first job as my campaign manager is to start dressing like one.
I don't want to have this conversation again.
Again?
You just hired me eight seconds ago.
Wow.
You're doing a really bad job.
- William, Elizabeth.
- Leslie, hi.
Hi.
What are you-- Are you coming to see me?
Did you hear that I'm relaunching my campaign?
Actually, no, sorry.
We weren't here to see you.
We've been meeting with other potential candidates for city council.
Oh, really?
So, my campaign ends and, just like that, you find someone else and run theirs?
Yes, that's our job.
I know.
Good luck, but, uh, I just had a big meeting with my new advisory board, and they're brilliant and amazing.
They're real killers.
Leslie, I tried to make ramen in the coffee pot and I broke everything.
Thank you, Andy.
I'll be right in.
Well, uh, good luck, Leslie.
Honestly.
Well, we don't need luck.
We are a rocket ship.
We are relaunching, and we're going to blast past your cann-- Huh, they're gone.
It's true--I no longer have highly-trained, professional campaign managers.
So what?
Are most murders committed by highly-trained, professional assassins?
No.
They're committed by friends and coworkers.
That analogy was way better in my head.
Hi.
Champion?
Oh my gosh, there you are, puppy.
- That's a good boy.
- That is a three-legged dog.
His name is Champion, because he's the dog world champion.
Okay, I have to ask this, I'm sorry, but how many legs did that dog have when you found him?
Three!
That's what makes him the best.
He can do more with three legs than most dogs can do with four.
Except for digging.
He's really bad at digging.
And you remember what you said about making decisions in the house?
You want to be involved.
We get that, so You just say the word, and Champion goes back to the pound, where he can be put down and killed forever.
I'm not gonna send a three-legged dog to his death.
Yes!
But I'm not gonna take care of him for you.
Well, it would be nice if you helped a little.
Because, unlike you, Andy and I have jobs.
Cruel, but fair.
So Leslie and I have come up with the theme for the campaign relaunch rally.
"The Comeback Kid".
Everyone loves a good comeback story.
Rocky.
Robert Downey, Jr. Terminator said, "I'll be back," and he was.
Also making a comeback-- the casual Hawaiian shirt.
Well, well, well, look, who's ahead of the curve.
I was joking.
You should soak that in bleach and burn it.
Okay, so, the rally's going to be held tomorrow at the Pawnee Sports Building.
April, you finalized a rental, right?
Shut up, Ann.
I told you never to talk to me.
That was Champion.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
Bad dog!
Yes, everything's fine with the rental.
Ron, you're constructing the stage?
Yes, ma'am.
Leslie wanted to hire a contractor to build a stage.
I don't want to paint with a broad brush here, but every single contractor in the world is a miserable, incompetent thief.
Seal the edges by crimping the fork--aw, crap.
Ed!
What's up, Chris?
Come on in, man.
I already did.
So, uh, how you been?
How are you doing?
- How are you?
- Great, actually.
I'm just learning how to make a "cali-zoin-za".
Or, as you Americans like to say, calzones.
- Do you want one?
- No, I find calzone fatty, and unnecessary.
So, you've hit a bit of a rough patch, and I care about you, so I just want to make sure you're doing okay.
Chris, honestly, I'm great.
I'm just exploring whatever fun activity pops into my brain.
Like, check this out.
I'm teaching myself how to do Claymation videos.
Isn't this just so cool?
It is so cool!
Ben is massively depressed, and he needs my help.
You look like a real campaign manager.
Oh, thanks, that's because I googled "campaign manager" and noticed that they wear a lot of dark colors.
See, there's more things to look at on the Internet - besides naked guys, Ann.
- What?
I need a team update, campaign manager.
Okay.
Pistol Pete Disellio will be here in five minutes.
I still can't believe that you got him.
Ann got local hero Pistol Pete Disellio to endorse me at the rally.
In 1992, Pistol Pete's last-second dunk against Eagleton High clinched a comeback victory for the Pawnee Central drunken savages.
Team mascot later changed.
Akash, buddy, of course I came to you first.
You're the best carpet man in Pawnee.
But here's my question-- Do your carpets match your drapes?
How do you make any event classy on a budget?
Red carpet.
My entire apartment is red carpet.
On top of that, leading into my bedroom, a second red carpet.
Oh, what's this in my shoe?
Red carpet insole.
Everywhere I go, I'm walking on red carpet.
Is there even enough room for everyone?
- Here, sit on my lap.
- No, that's humiliating.
Can't I at least sit on Andy's lap?
No, that's Champion's spot.
He called it.
Tom, we're already late.
Now, be a man, and sit on that girl's lap.
Yes, sir.
Hi, Pete Disellio.
We can call you Pistol, right?
I prefer Pete.
Oh.
Okay, got it.
I'm Leslie Knope.
We overlapped a year at Pawnee Central.
You probably remember my voice from the morning announcements.
This is my campaign manager, Ann Perkins.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Come on in.
Oh, thanks.
- I'm excited to be here.
- Ah!
We're excited to have you.
Ann is killing it.
My campaign team is unstoppable.
This rally is going to be awesome.
Oh, my God, I'm feeling it!
I'm gonna break dance!
Leslie?
Coming!
Thank God.
Oh, Champion is a way better kisser than you are, babe.
- Nuh-uh!
- Yes, he is.
He's even a better kisser than me.
Here, try some.
Okay, stop it.
He's drooling on me!
Oh!
- This is unsafe.
- Ha ha!
Oh, we should do it for the kids.
Kids love it, Ron.
Just for the kids.
Hi, kids!
Hey!
Oh, look.
The police even love it.
They're sirening back to us.
That's awesome, I was going to tell them that we-- Heard ya, bud!
And then, you come out, and you dunk the ball, and you say, "Voting for Leslie Knope is a slam dunk"!
You can still dunk, right?
- Oh, I can, but I won't.
- Sorry?
Look, everywhere I go, everybody wants me to talk about that dunk, and that game.
It feels like I'm living in the past.
But the past is great.
The jitterbug, stagecoaches, Herman Munster.
Look, Leslie, I read up on you.
You've done great stuff for our parks system and I will happily endorse you As Peter Disellio, regional distributor for Derwin ham loafs, but if this is about who I was, or what I did when I was 17, I'm out of here.
Let's not talk about dunking anymore.
Let's talk about what you want to do.
- Okay.
- I think you want to dunk.
I'm not going to dunk the ball.
What about a layup?
Officer, I've been operating heavy machinery since I was eight years old.
Now, I respect you and your service to this town and your country, but what laws are we breaking exactly?
Well, you got four people in the front seat, nobody's wearing a seat belt, you were speeding and blasting your horn through the hospital zone, the rear of the vehicle's open, debris has been falling out, and you don't have a commercial license to drive a truck.
Okay.
Well, we have a philosophical difference on what constitutes a law.
I need to see your hands and could you step out of the vehicle, please?
Hi.
I just wanted you to know we're about to be arrested.
Oh my God, April, that's horrible.
Where are you?
"My mother's butt," really?
That's really helpful.
Let me talk to her.
April, this is city council candidate Leslie Knope.
Do not make any trouble.
Sit tight.
I'm on my way.
- Whoa.
You just hung up on her?
- She'd already hung up on me.
Okay, I'm going to go down there and get them out, because men in uniform love me.
You have to get Pistol Pete to make that shot.
Okay, but if I don't, it's no big deal, right?
- You'll just make your speech?
- He's our surprise headliner.
The whole town loves him.
I'm polling at 1%.
He must dunk, Ann.
Do whatever it takes.
You know, anything short of sexual favors.
- What?
- I do not-- I repeat, I do not want you to tempt him with sexual favors.
- I wasn't going to.
- Good, I wouldn't either.
That's where I draw the line.
Although, I am a little offended that you wouldn't do that for me.
- Go.
- Right.
- So, BenWhy Calzone?
- Glad you asked, Chris.
You know, there's fast food hamburgers.
There's fast food Mexican.
There's fast food Chinese.
Blah blah blah.
Have you ever wondered why there isn't a fast food option for Italian food?
What about pizza?
Pizza?
Never heard of it.
That's what people will be saying in 20 years, because pizza is old news, Chris.
Pizza is your grandfather's calzone.
Never thought of it that way.
What I'm talking about is a portable, delicious meal, that is it's own container.
It's a whole new spin on Italian fast casual dining.
Amazing.
And you of all people will like this.
I'm gonna use low-fat ingredients.
Game-changer.
And I will call my new Italian fast casual eatery "The Low-cal Calzone Zone".
That idea is literally the greatest idea I've ever heard in my life.
That idea is terrible.
Glen, you're killing me.
They broke about 50 laws, Knope.
And that girl, she tried to get that gimp dog to bite me.
Look, I could sit here and fill out all the paperwork, but you and I both know that you'd rather go home to Debra, have a nice home-cooked meal, and do what comes naturally.
That's not appropriate.
You know that I'm gonna pay all the fines.
I'm in the middle of a campaign rally, and this is my team.
- I need them, please.
- Fine.
But unless one of you has a commercial license, you can't take that truck.
It would just mean so much to us.
I mean, you're a living legend.
They still air that game every Friday night on cable access.
Yeah, well, being a living legend is sort of a double-edged sword.
Everybody in this town still calls me "Pistol".
Tell me more about that, Peter.
I mean, yes, that dunk, it made me famous, but sometimes Sometimes life dunks you.
Hey, man, you want to go for a jog?
Just, sort of, kick out the cobwebs, get some endorphins going?
Oh, no, thanks, Chris.
Kind of tearing this Claymation video a new one right now.
You know, Ben, I really think you need to take a step back here.
I think getting some perspective would be good.
What are you talking about?
I've known you a long time.
And, right now, you need help.
- With my Claymaish?
- With your life.
You are wildly, insanely depressed.
Depressed?
I'm the furthest thing from depressed.
I mean, look at what I've accomplished.
Do you see him?
Do you think a depressed person could make this?
No.
- That's all we can fit in here.
- No problem.
This is going to be fine.
We're all going to be fine, because the team is still together, and there's nothing the team can't do.
Wait, I think Champion has to go to the bathroom.
- Oh!
He shall do it in the car!
- Answer your phone, Ann.
That's what life is like in a strict Roman Catholic household.
Of course, my father, he was more stick than carrot when it came to matters of discipline.
I'm sorry, but the Ben Wyatt that I know, I just don't think he'd be happy sitting here faffing around.
I'm not faffing around.
I've sunk myself into my hobbies.
Here, I'll show you my Claymation project, okay?
Now, I've been working pretty hard on this, andI think it's really good.
So just hang on to your hat, okay?
Here it goes.
Oh, how great.
Stand in the place where you-- - Did you pause it?
- No, I--hang on.
Stand in the place where you-- Oh, my God.
That's the whole thing.
- That's three weeks of work.
- You're gonna be okay.
No, no, no, no, I'm not.
You see, in my head, I thought that was really, really cool.
I emailed Leslie two days ago and I compared it to Avatar, Chris, and how can it not be longer?
Okay, look, what you're feeling, right now is regret and shame.
Okay, no word from Ann.
April, I need a status report.
- How's it looking out there?
- Perfect, but just one thing.
It's not a basketball court any more.
It's an ice skating rink.
Wait, what?
Why?
What happened?
The stupid guy I called to book this place didn't tell me they took off the basketball floor for a hockey game.
Or maybe he did tell me, but he was so stupid and boring that I wasn't listening, and either way, it was his fault, because he was stupid and I hated him.
Ron, how's the stage coming?
Well, since we had to jettison the bulk of the wood, this is the biggest I could make it.
Oh, my God.
Good lord, what happened to the rest of my face?
We had to "Jetsons" most of the poster too, but I kind of like it, 'cause windows are the eyes to the house.
Wow.
- Okay, I got Pistol Pete.
- Good, where is he?
Right now, he's curled up in the back seat of my car, talking about his father, who is a piece of work.
I actually think he did the best he could for a single father, but I may be too close to the situation.
Anyway, the important news is that he's here.
Good.
Is he going to dunk for me?
I'm not sure, I couldn't hear through all the crying.
- He's crying?
- No, I was crying.
It's been a stressful day, and he's had a really rough life.
Oh, my God.
We should cancel it, right?
Maybe we should cancel it?
- Yeah.
- Jerry You were in charge of getting a crowd.
Please tell me that you pulled a Jerry, and no one's here.
Okay, well, first of all, I don't like it when you guys use that term.
But for the record, I came through.
There are almost a hundred people out there!
Oh, damn it, Jerry, you just had to do your job, didn't you?
Yeah, can't you do anything wrong, Jerry?
I've been looking at our utter and complete lack of experience as a positive thing, but I'm starting to think it actually might be a problem.
Okay, guys, everybody listen up.
I just wanted to say thank you.
You've all volunteered your time and, no matter what, I am eternally grateful for it.
Now, I'm going to go out there, and I'm going to announce the relaunch, and I'm going to muddle through this thing as best I can.
You should all leave, and when this thing is over, I'll meet you at the nearest bar.
That would be Hurley's.
- Oh, it's karaoke tonight!
- Yes!
No, no, no, guys.
No.
We're not leaving, okay?
We're the reason Leslie's in this mess.
It's our mess.
We're going to stay here and we're going to go out there as a team.
Or, we go as a team to Hurley's.
No, Ann's right.
We're a team.
We're all going out together.
Let's give this crowd a show.
Go, team!
Get up and make it happen get on your feet Tom?
Couldn't afford enough premium carpet to get us to the stage.
I mean, it was a short walk, but it was pretty luxurious, right?
Okay.
Everybody smile and wave.
Get up and make it happen get on your feet Stop leaning on my arm, Andy.
I'm holding the dog.
He is peeing.
He is now peeing.
I am putting him down.
No, Ron, he only has three legs!
- Get off me!
- No, I'm scared!
Get up and make it happen Ron?
Ron?
There's no stairs.
How do I get onto the stage?
Oh!
And take some action Get on your feet get up and make it happen get on your feet Okay.
Uhh!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Get on your feet Mm-mm.
Here you go.
Drink up, because it has every herb in my herb belt.
Oh.
Tastes like a belt.
I know, isn't it awful?
But it works wonderfully.
So, tell me.
Do you admit that you're depressed?
How did you know?
I didn't even know.
The Letters to Cleo t-shirt, the unshaven face, the Doc Martins, and your hair does not have that normal, uptight, rigid, inflexible Ben Wyatt sense of fun.
You can't hide these things from friends.
I think I'm feeling better.
Herbal smoothie, you have done it again.
As a loyal pawneean, I've always been proud of this town, and, I, oh, um, sorry.
My cards got out of order here when they fell.
Together, we can defeat obese children.
I'm sure that was something positive, originally.
I'm sorry, okay, this is just a disaster, isn't it?
This is the worst political event ever in history.
Well, um, I can assure you people in the bleachers that, if you follow my campaign, it will be interesting.
It sure will be!
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Pistol Pete, and around here, I'm a Pawnee legend!
I just wanted to say that I fully endorse Leslie Knope.
She's got a great team behind her, and a vote for her is a slam dunk.
Thanks, Pistol Pete!
Wow, we're so happy to have you.
Oh, hey.
There he goes.
Come on, Pete!
Oh!
Okay, stay still.
Stay down.
Pistol Pete, everybody.
Still got it.
- Hey.
- Hey, how was the rally?
- Oh, we nailed it!
- No, we didn't.
Ben, my campaign manager and I have made a decision.
We've decided to fire the campaign manager--me.
- And hire you.
- But we've talked about this.
I don't care if you're poison to my campaign.
This team has a lot of heart and zero know-how.
You're the only one that can save us.
Please be my campaign manager.
You know, Leslie, Ben's really been going through something, and he's on a journey, so I don't think he's gonna be-- I'll do it.
I'm in.
I've done enough exploring.
I'm good.
- Okay, great.
- Ann, you're fired.
Oh, thank God.
No, don't make out.
It's making Champion sad.
Surprise!
We felt really bad about the whole dredging up your past just to be publically humiliated thing.
- So, cookies.
- And balloons.
Thanks, guys.
It-- that's nice.
We feel so bad.
Is there anything else we can do?
You could let me take you to dinner.
Yes, Ann, yes.
You should do that.
Oh, I can't, though, because I'm married.
You're not married.
She's not married.
This is uncomfortable.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Ladies and gentlemen, the next city councilor for the great city of Pawnee Bobby Newport.
Hey.
Thanks, guy.
Hey, all right.
Hi, I'm Bobby Newport.
You know, we're two days into this campaign, and so far it's going great.
In fact, I don't know why they call it a "cam-pain".
Because up until now it's been a "cam-pleasure".
All right, hey, why don't we line up for autographs and free Bobby bars.
Huh?
Who wants a Bobby bar?
Bobby Newport, heir to the sweetums candy fortune.
My dad made 'em.
He just entered the race, and he's already He is attractive and charming.
And his family employs half the town, but so what?
I am a lifelong government bureaucrat who's well-versed in the issues.
And those are the kind of sexy qualifications that win elections.
How's it going?
I'm Bobby Newport.
But you probably knew that already.
Well, Mr. Newport, we meet at last.
I'm Leslie Knope.
Ah, okeydoke.
So do you want me to sign that to miss lope or just Nesney?
What?
No.
Leslie's fine.
Leslie?
Yeah, miss Knope is a candidate for city council.
Been calling your office trying to set up a debate.
Oh, no, you guys are wrong.
I'm running unopposed.
I'm pretty sure I'm running unopposed, right?
No, you're not running unopposed.
You've very opposed by me.
Oh, terrific.
I love meeting people.
I love it, yeah.
What do you guys do?
We just told you.
We're gonna be running for city council.
Great.
Here, have a Bobby bar.
Go ahead, my dad made 'em.
Okay, folks.
Hey, I'm Bobby Newport.
I think we scared him.
Here, have a Bobby bar.
My dad made 'em.
Hey, Ann, are you still a nurse or did they fire you because you slept with all the doctors?
You wanna try that again?
Hey, Ann, are you still a nurse?
Because Andy's not feeling well.
What's wrong, Andy?
Just got a headache.
And I'm seeing double.
And I got a song stuck in my head, and my teeth hurt.
Also I'm hungry.
Okay, well, some of those things are symptoms and some of them are just being a person.
Did you hit your head?
No.
Oh, yes, technically I did smash my head area into the wall area.
Yeah, he was hanging up his gold record.
Oh, my God, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
Point is, I have a gold record.
Well, I can help you with cuts and bruises but the other stuff you're gonna have to see a real doctor.
Hey, smart ass, we can't afford it.
Hey, smart ass, yes, you can.
You have insurance.
Neither of your asses are that smart because insurance is for if something bad happens to your car.
P.S. I haven't had it in years.
Oh, my God, we used to live together.
Yeah, you still got it for me.
I'm Bobby Newport.
My family owns nine square Miles of land in this town.
And isn't my family what this town's really about?
Vote Bobby Newport for city council.
That guy is everywhere.
I am not complaining.
Well, we have to find a way to beat him.
And luckily Ben is going to announce the most amazing campaign strategy ever thought of in the entire history of western democracy.
Go, Ben, here's your great idea.
We're all ready for it.
And start.
I'm running for office.
I'm surrounded by my friends.
My campaign manager and I are in love.
This is exactly how I dreamed it would be when I was a kid.
Except I wasn't and my campaign manager was Mr. belvedere.
We are David.
Newport is goliath.
This is our slingshot.
- Yes, we'll write an inspiring op-ed piece.
- No, the Pawnee-eagleton high school basketball game.
Now, in this town it's bigger than the super bowl.
We take all our money, we air a TV ad right at halftime.
And I think we should make an attack ad against Bobby Newport.
- Oh!
- That is a great idea!
- Thank you.
- Excellent.
- Yay, it's a good idea.
- All right, great.
So let's get to work.
Ron Swanson.
How are you?
Present.
I have a meeting at public works, and I was thinking that maybe you might wanna sit in.
Why would you think that?
They are working on a number of fascinating, big-budget projects I'm very busy here.
That I am being forced to brutally cut entirely.
I can make room in my schedule.
Wonderful.
As you know, I'm not a big fan of delivering bad news.
Chris, it would be my absolute pleasure.
Have you considered cutting the entire fire department?
I've personally put out several local fires at no cost to the taxpayer.
Look to the left.
The right.
Whatever.
Are you the kind of doctor who gets hooked on his own drugs?
I bet you are.
So, Andy, tell me what happened.
I was reading an encyclopedia, and I tripped or "fell over" and hit my head or brain helmet.
Yeah, he sneezed and smacked his head against the wall.
That sounds about right.
Well, if it's a concussion it's extremely mild, so I wouldn't worry about it.
Anything else bothering you?
- Nope.
- Okay.
Well, I mean, yeah, I've got a weird rash in my knee pit area.
And my tongue, on this side, doesn't taste anything anymore.
Sometimes when I walk my ankles make, like, a weird rattlesnake sound.
What else?
Things that are far away from my eyes are fuzzy.
I once at a twix with the wrapper on it, and I've never seen the wrapper come out.
Also I've swallowed every piece of gum that I've chewed for the past 25 years.
- Andy!
- I don't know.
I broke my thumb on the way over here.
Just fix me.
Well, I can help you with the thumb.
And I'll have to give you referrals for specialists for the other thousand things.
Wow, thanks for nothing, Dr. Harris.
You're welcome.
Hey, I'm Bobby Newport.
I'm a regular guy.
I like dogs.
I'm here with my persian greyhound raclette, who was given to me by my buddy, the pretender to the crown of alsace-Lorraine.
Vote Bobby Newport for city council.
Hey, um, between you and me, I think that Donna is having a problem with going negative in the ad.
- Nah-uh, I always go negative.
Even if I like the guy I go negative.
Keeps 'em interested.
Thanks, Donna.
Well, I didn't want to tell you this, but Ann is having a hard time with it.
She's kind of freaking out right now.
Oh, my God, this magic marker smells like cherries.
Hey, here's a question, do you like the idea?
It's who Do you like it?
Look, you have a vision of how your campaign should go.
I am your chief strategist, so I'm sure we can work it out.
Why don't you just tell me what you're thinking.
I hate negative ads, and I would never do one in a million years.
Thank you, John, for coming in.
The public works department is wonderful, and you are the best idea man in the business.
We're cancelling all of your ongoing projects.
What?
What about the Pawnee river dam?
Dam's dead.
Have a nice day.
Where will all the water go?
Wherever it's headed now.
The important thing is the dam is never happening and your dream has been crushed.
- We're very sorry.
- I am not.
Good meeting.
It's not a negative ad.
We're stating facts about him, and, yeah, they happen to be negative because he's a bonehead.
Well, I wanted to run an ad that highlights the good things about me, not the bad things about somebody else.
Tom, you are our communications director.
Weigh in here.
Leslie, I love your idea.
I also love your idea.
Two great ideas, two great people.
I don't know which idea's better, but I do know I'll end up on the winning side.
When I bet on horses, I never lose.
Why?
I bet on all the horses.
How 'bout we do this, we split up into teams, we each make a demo version of our ad.
Whichever one we like better we use.
Great idea!
As long as Leslie thinks so as well.
Sure, I'll pick Ann and Donna for my team.
You can take Jerry.
What?
Well, you wanted to go negative.
You got the biggest negative in the world, buddy.
Okay everybody I need big smiles from you We're making a positive ad here.
So just think of this as Christmas and your birthday and the first day of school all rolled up into one.
Positive is always better than negative.
Barack Obama said, "yes we can," and now he's president.
Ben says, "no we shouldn't," and now he's working for his girlfriend.
Guys, I need double the smiles, okay?
Let's take it back again.
And action.
And this is going great.
We're really positive.
I think we're getting good stuff, right?
What's it?
Oh, come on.
Leslie, I think Bobby Newport's bus was in that shot.
Do you think?
E, h, 4, m. Potato shape.
Coffee mug shape.
Smudge, smudge, middle finger, smudge.
The rest are all smudges.
Oh, my God, you drove us here.
We made, like, 100 million doctors' appointments for ourselves in one week.
After this we won't have to go to the doctor for, like, ten years, because we're smart.
Well, you definitely need glasses.
No, he's not getting glasses.
I like his face the way it is.
If you get glasses, I'll divorce you.
Well, you heard her, doc.
Too handsome for glasses, no offense.
I gotta admit, his hair game's on point.
Gotta find out what kind of product he puts up in his "herr".
Hey, how's Leslie's ad going?
It's very good.
But yours is also very good.
- You ready for the voice-over?
Yeah.
Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
You gotta give it more attitude.
It's gotta scare people.
Bobby Newport Yeah, okay.
All right.
Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
- Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport.
- Bobby.
- Bobby.
Bobby.
Newport.
All right, now we're just wasting time, Jerry.
Ron Swanson!
I want to thank you for being so ruthless and cruel in the meeting the other day.
You'll have to be more specific.
With the public works department about the dam.
Ah.
What do you say I take you to lunch and then we can talk about all the projects that you want to get accomplished.
That won't be necessary.
I don't have any projects.
I hate projects.
What a pill.
We should order.
And then we can talk shop.
What are you gonna have?
I'm thinking something raw and cucumber-based.
A cucumber.
I don't know what happened.
I declined his invitation.
He started laughing.
And the next thing I knew, we were at lunch.
Did he drug me?
Hi, I'm Bobby Newport.
My dad is friends with John cougar mellencamp.
That's pretty cool.
What is this guy running for, president of being on every channel all the time?
Reminder, Leslie, we have less than an hour to get the ad to the station.
Ann, you're beautiful and you're organized.
So in order not to bias anyone, these are the two ads that Ben and I made.
I'm just gonna pick one randomly, and we'll play that one first.
Oh, yay, the awesome one.
Hi, I'm Leslie Knope.
I'm pro-parks, pro-public safety, and I'm pro-clean water.
I'm also pro-environmental regulation, and I'm very, very pro-local propositions But most of all, I'm pro-Pawnee.
Here are some other things that I'm pro.
As you can see, I'm in favor of a lot of things, like hot dogs.
Right, Charlie?
I'm Leslie Knope, and I approve this message.
Yes.
I love it.
Fantastic.
Do we even want to screen yours?
Uh, yeah, that was awful.
What do you mean?
Name one thing that was wrong with it.
Okay, you never even mentioned you were running for office.
You literally never said the words "city council".
I did it's implied.
I didn't we can just put it in.
Okay.
Leslie is so good at so many things and so bad at that.
Bobby Newport's been handed everything on a silver platter.
His cushy job at his dad's candy company, handed to him.
His 60-foot boat, Bobby's boat, handed to him when he was 12.
Leslie Knope is running for city council too, and she's earned everything she's ever gotten.
She has.
Bobby Newport wants you to just hand him this election.
Don't.
I won't.
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.
I love it.
Now, people, this is an ad.
It's succinct, it's punchy.
It's mean.
It's depressing.
It's awful.
"I am Ben Wyatt, and I want to destroy Leslie's dreams".
Okay, if you're allergic to any food, we'll know in a few days.
I think based on the redness I might be allergic to getting stabbed by needles.
We have already been to, like, five different doctors.
I got my ankles microwaved.
- X-rayed.
They took my blood away to use for science.
Cholesterol tests.
April had her sinuses removed?
Looked at.
Some guy looked at my wiener, touched it.
That was weird.
And that guy wasn't even a doctor.
That What?
Now I think it is time for us to take a vote.
So who's in favor of Ben's ad?
Traitors!
Ann, I painted your garage pink.
I did not ask you to do that.
Leslie, look, I want you to win, and Ben's ad is just better.
Our friendship is over.
No, it's not.
It's not over.
It's never over.
Bff.
I love you forever.
You know what, it seems like we're kind of evenly split.
I think we should keep debating.
We're not split.
It's unanimous.
- We air my ad.
- But I This is just it's just not the way I dreamed it would be.
This is the right call, okay?
I promise.
Okay.
I'm going to air a negative ad.
It's out of my hands now.
But you know what, I'm actually feeling very zen about this.
- Are you are Ben Wyatt?
- Yeah.
Okay, I need that DVD in the control room.
- Aah!
- Oh, my God.
I am Leslie Knope, and I do not approve this message.
What are you doing?
What are you Ah.
Alright, the good news is, there's only two pieces of bad news.
The bad news is, none of our ads aired and we cannot get our money back.
Oh, God.
There was probably a better way for you to tell us that.
You both really blew this.
But I can't wait to hear your new ideas.
I love 'em already.
Ooh, I'm hungry.
Tommy needs a mango.
See ya.
I'm really sorry I tackled you.
It's just, I'd rather run the fake campaign ads that I made when I was ten than become negative and cynical.
Look, I really don't wanna crush your childhood dreams, but I bet in your dreams you weren't losing an election by 70 points.
You need to get tougher, Leslie.
You just have to.
You need to get tougher.
You were pretty easy to take down.
Thanks.
Ron Swanson!
Just the man I wanted to see.
I'm going to be going to a seminar on the art of the japanese tea ceremony Or chakat the Pawnee community college, and I thought you might like to come with me.
Why?
I know how much you value silence.
A fair point.
But we did just have lunch last week, so I feel like we've spent enough social time together for the foreseeableEver.
All right, well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me.
Donna Meagle!
Chris Traeger!
For some godforsaken reason that man is suddenly determined to hang on with me.
You mean hang out?
What is wrong with him?
I don't know, he's got you doing Ben's job, eating lunch with him like Ben used to.
Maybe he just misses his little buddy.
Ow.
Let's get you home and get me some ice cream.
Here's your bill.
Whoa, yeah, won't be needing that.
I've got the free medicine card.
Uh, there's a $500 deductible for dental procedures.
Oh, I think you're wrong.
We have the insurance thing.
I believe we're covered.
It's still $500.
Let's see here.
Oh, because, you know what Let's go!
Dine and dash.
Out of the way!
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Ah!
Ah, call an ambulance!
A different ambulance than the one I ran into.
This is city council candidate Leslie Knope when she was ten years old.
Hi, I'm Leslie Knope.
I love Pawnee.
And I want to make it even better.
Better schools, safer streets, and a more progressive tax on residential properties.
This is city council candidate Bobby Newport today.
People keep asking me: Bobby, what are you gonna do once you get into office?
Um, I'm pretty sure I'll figure it out.
Leslie Knope had better ideas when she was ten than Bobby Newport has now.
They do have one thing in common.
Both: I like dogs.
For a better Pawnee, vote Knope for city council.
Well, we already have a thousand views.
Yeah, but no calls from reporters, no interview requests.
I don't care.
I'm proud of it.
You sure?
It is accurate about my opponent, it does not take Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold that thought.
Ron Swanson!
What a pleasant surprise.
And who's this?
This is a great friend of mine.
He is a fellow who works in the building and he is named Dennis.
Kyle.
He strongly enjoys japanese culture, and I thought he might wanna go with you to the thing.
- The tea ceremony.
- Yes.
You're a brother japanophile?
I was eating rice, and Ron made me come up here.
But sure, that sounds fun.
Arigato.
Ron, a moment.
All right, pal, level with me.
What's going on?
Well, you seemed like you wanted a friend.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not lonely.
I have me.
And 4,000 Facebook friends and a hot girlfriend.
I wanted to spend time with you, because I have to replace Ben as assistant city manager and I was giving you a tryout of sorts.
Now, I'll mull my options for the next few months, but I'd love you to keep an open mind.
Kyle-San!
Arigato!
Mr. Newport, hello.
Hi.
Leslie Knope.
Ben Wyatt.
- Yeah, hi.
- Good to see you.
Nice to see you.
You guys want anything?
This is a restaurant, so they have food and stuff.
- I'll take a milkshake.
- We're good.
No, we're good.
What can we do for you?
Yes, um, why'd you guys post that video of me, man?
I mean, that didn't make me feel good.
It was it was mean.
You guys are mean.
Well, we used your own ad, so I don't think it was mean.
All right, let me lay it out for you.
My friends keep sending me links to that video and they just make fun of me.
So just stop running, okay?
Just that stop.
Stop running the ad?
No, stop running the campaign.
What?
Just quit.
It would be so cool of you if you just quit.
Then I can win the election, and I'll have a big party, and I'll put you both on the guest list, plus one.
I'm gonna have a man who does magic.
He's really good.
Not, like, cheesy magic.
Like, good magic.
We're not gonna quit the campaign.
Why would we do that?
Because I want it.
Come on, give me it.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Come on, give me it.
Just give me the election.
I'm sorry, please.
Please.
Well, Leslie, he does make a compelling argument.
Come on, ugh!
Come on, guy.
- Bobby.
- Ah, it's not padded!
Can I ask you a question?
Why are you even running for office?
You know what, I need something to do to get my dad off my back.
This seemed easy.
What about you, why are you doing it?
Who's your dad?
I'm running for office because I want to improve the lives of the people that I love and the city that's the greatest city in the world.
What?
What does that even mean?
Hey, I've got an idea.
How 'bout you quit running, then I win, but then I let you do all the work.
I'm not going anywhere, and we are gonna debate soon, and I need to warn you, I know my stuff.
So you should toughen up.
Why are you guys smiling?
I feel bad.
Hey, quick question.
That little girl from your video.
Oh, my God, she's so cute.
Do you think you can talk to her and let her do an ad for me?
That girl is me as a ten-year-old.
How'd you do that?
Maybe you should see one of the other doctors.
No.
No more doctors.
They're a bunch of scam artists.
They reel you in with the free stuff.
Next thing you know, bam, you run into an ambulance.
Every time.
Let's just go home and care for each other.
We could buy a sewing kit.
You could sew up my lip underneath a bridge somewhere.
Mmm, so romantic.
- - Oh, sorry, I forgot.
Let's go.
All right.
Do you think sewing kits are covered by insurance?
Or groceries or, like, Xbox games?
What is insurance?
I don't know.
Who cares?
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
I will institute a reduction in taxes For the small-business owner as well as a 7% surcharge on all nonlocal business-related development.
Together we will build a better pawnee.
So what we're looking for here are your overall impressions of this candidate.
What do you like about her?
What don't you like about her?
Her ideas, her voice, her clothes probably.
Well, my campaign has a little momentum, so we're trying to capitalize on that by doing a focus group.
Some things are very helpful.
Other things are not so helpful.
All the things make me feel a lot of feelings about myself.
She's kinda short, don't you think?
Aggressively short almost.
It's like she's throwing it in my face.
Insightful.
You, sir, said you would not vote for her, correct?
Yeah.
Yeah, she seems a little uptight.
She doesn't seem like the kind of person you could go bowling with, you know?
What?
That's ridiculous.
I am excellent at bowling.
Ask Ron.
Leslie, I know it's tough to hear these things, but just try not to get obsessed over one comment.
You're totally right.
I'm not obsessing.
Okay, what are you doing?
I'm just reminding myself to tell Ron to tell you how good I am at bowling.
All right.
I actually thought that she was smart, and I'd vote for her.
There you go.
Although I once knew a Leslie, and, uh, she was just awful.
So now I hate all Leslies.
Would she consider changing her name?
Okay, here we go.
a strong command of the issues.
That is good, but only 33% said that they would consider voting for you.
Mm, yeah, that's really interesting stuff.
Why did that guy say that he wouldn't want to go bowling with me?
You really have to let that go.
I've never been very good at letting things go.
I can't tell you how many times a fun tug-of-war with a dog over a chew toy turned contentious.
One of us always ends up mad.
I did some research too about the guy who said the thing about me and bowling, and his name is Derek.
Oh, my God.
And get this he's not even that good of a bowler.
His average is 132, according to the most recent available data.
Leslie, that comment wasn't really about whether you're good at bowling - which I am.
Ask Ron.
- Which we all know you are.
But some people have the impression that you're a little elitist or intellectual or something.
That is so sexist.
It's just because I'm a woman.
Would they deign to say such things to Woodrow Wilson or Benjamin Disraeli okay, I see what you're talking about.
See, a lot of people don't vote with their brains.
They vote with their guts.
I know you're fun, and you can have a good time.
The public needs to see that.
Well, then maybe the campaign should host a bowling night.
- Hmm.
- It would be laid-back.
Everyone having fun, great photo op.
That could actually work.
Also I'm really good at bowling.
No, I don't think I believe you.
Is there anyone I can ask?
Yeah.
Ask Ron.
Oh, okay.
You're kidding.
All right, it is time for the 12th Leslie Knope Fundraising Phone Bank.
Is everybody feeling good?
Oh, I don't know, Jerry.
It's Sunday night, I'm making phone calls to strangers, and you're in my house.
My life couldn't be worse.
Hey!
Let's get this phone party started.
- No.
- Sorry I'm late, guys.
I know this kind of thing can be a grind, but Ben said that this is the most important thing we can do to help Leslie.
So tonight is going to be fun.
You're probably thinking, how could it possibly be fun?
- No one's thinking that.
- I kinda was.
I was not.
Why are we laughing?
Well, anyway, tonight we are gonna spice things up with a little competition.
Whoever raises the most money by the end of the night will win two free movie passes to the pawnee mono-plex.
You really think that's gonna motivate people oh, my God.
I could use that for a romantic night with Millicent Gergich.
Out of my way, suckers.
As city manager, I play no favorites.
But as a private citizen, I am free to support whomever I choose, and I choose to support team Knope 'cause they're the best.
Everybody's the best.
We're all winners.
- Do I look laid-back?
- You look like you're trying to look laid-back.
How about now?
I think just maybe just stand how you would normally stand.
Okay.
I forget now.
Hey, Ron.
Thanks for coming, man.
Of course.
This bowling alley has my favorite restaurant in pawnee.
Really?
You're not scared to eat here?
When I eat, it is the food that is scared.
Why are you sitting weird?
- Damn it.
- Who's ready to bowl so hard?
Tommy's new bowling swag.
You know what?
When you do it, you really do it.
Good for you, man.
Hello, I'm calling on behalf of Leslie Knope, who is running for city council.
Is this Deirdre Splatterfork?
That is literally the most beautiful name I have ever heard.
No, I don't think we can accept donations over $50.
I don't really know why you would need my social security number, but well, yeah, no.
You're right.
I guess it couldn't hurt to give it to you.
It's 210 absolutely nothing.
What are you wearing?
Fine, if you don't wanna donate, then don't.
Oh, by the way I'm calling from inside your house.
- Ha ha!
$100.
- Whoa.
This is unbelievable.
I cannot be stopped.
I don't care about that prize, but I'm gonna win because I want his happiness to go away.
Type in "T Rex" for me.
No, no, no.
Um, "t-boz".
Wait, wait.
"Tommy Tsunami".
No, "ticky ticky Tom-Tom".
No, "fly guy".
I wrote "tom".
Classic.
Timeless.
I love it.
"Girl"?
I saw your ad from when you were a kid, but it's nice to have a beer and get to know you.
Aw, thanks, rich.
Oh, here.
Smile.
Maybe you'll get your picture the pawnee journal.
Hey, this is going really well.
Pretty decent turnout.
Yeah, you know, I feel very, you know, casual, relaxed.
Hey, is that the guy from the from the focus group?
Huh.
I don't know.
- I think it is.
- Is it?
Excuse me, sir, would you mind telling me how you heard about the event tonight?
Oh, uh, I got a weird invitation in the mail.
I didn't realize we were sending out invitations.
Oh.
Hey, you're that girl from the focus group thing I did.
Oh, I wouldn't know.
I'm never on the other side of the glass with those things.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Yep.
Straight down the middle.
No hook, no spin, no fuss.
Anything more and this becomes figure skating.
Come on, big girl.
Let's knock these little pins down.
Oh, my God, are you serious?
Son, people can see you.
Boom!
That right there Tommy's strike.
Leslie, what happened to the big picture?
I'm thinking about the big picture.
I'm trying to make the picture bigger by including this guy in it.
I can't do anything about my gender or my height, but I can win that guy over with a fun round of bowling.
We need everyone here to see a different side of Leslie Knope, not one specific person.
Some people just aren't gonna like you.
Let it go.
Okay, I hear you.
I'll treat him just like everybody else.
I'll just say hi to him, shake his hand, buy a him a few beers, share a few laughs, bowl a few frames, lose intentionally to make him feel good, friend him on Facebook.
And by the end of the night, he will be mine.
Whoa, "thar" she bowls.
I'm Leslie Knope.
You wanna bowl?
You wanna bowl together?
You wanna be, like, bowl buddies?
Sure.
Great, just a casual game, you know?
No biggie.
You okay?
My sister has scoliosis, and I think you might, you know Oh, no.
No, I'm just I'm just being cas.
What are you rocking?
A 15 pounder?
- 16.
- Whoa, hey, good for you.
Oh, there they are.
I just ordered some wings for us.
You like wings?
- Love them.
- Really?
Who knew?
I knew.
Damn it.
Why are you mad?
You bowled a strike.
That's how I motivate myself, you know?
Never good enough.
Let me get you a beer.
Cool.
These beers are as cold as the Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road.
You watch Ice Road Truckers?
Yeah, dude.
It's my guilty pleasure.
Tom, I'm asking you as a man to stop this immediately.
- Boom!
- What the?
Hello, is this Mrs. Gallivan?
Well, my name is April, and wouldn't you know it, I'm raising money for a city council candidate I believe in.
No, mira, mira, mira, mira, mira.
It's, like, whatever you want.
Like, $10.
It don't matter.
Well, I reckon it's just like grammy Martha told me and my cousins, "you can't eat the biscuits if you don't pay for the flour".
Put the phone down, take a deep breath, and then you are going to tell Steven that you will be treated with respect, okay?
And thank you for your donation.
Well, gee, I don't know, Fred.
All I know is that I just want to live in a world that's a better place, and your contribution will definitely help us get there, to the Better-place world, Fred.
Yeehaw!
Man, move over, pins.
There's a new Sheriff in town.
You are so down with strikes, they should call you Norma Rae.
- Who's that?
- It's a Sally Field movie about Unions.
Doesn't matter.
The point is, you're really good at this.
It's your turn.
Try not to break a nail.
Ah, classic Derek with the Zings.
Man, that's what bowling is all about hey.
How's it going?
- It's going really good.
- Oh, good.
Um, we're just hanging out and having a very good time.
Okay, I just wanted to remind you that when you're bowling, try not to fixate on just one pin.
You're trying to knock down a lot of pins.
I realize that, but I will knock down this pin, and then this pin will knock down all the other pins.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, could you get me another one of these?
I I don't work here.
Classic Derek.
I am taking a probiotic tea break.
And while that is happening, I thought I might share some big news.
I am going to ask Millicent Gergich to move in with me.
D-I I mean, if that's okay with you of course, Jerry.
- Uh, yeah.
- Of course.
Sure.
That's awesome, man.
Hey, do you guys wanna live here with us and Ben and champion, the three-legged dog?
- That is an amazing offer.
- Yes!
But I think we're probably gonna get our own place.
I'm already working with a Real Estate agent to find an octagonal house.
I've done some reading, and an octagon is the optimal shape for a home in terms of energy flow.
You know, Chris, I hate to pull rank, but if you're going to take a break, would you mind going in the living room, just, you know, so it doesn't disturb everybody else.
Jerry, I love it when you pull rank.
You're being weird.
Why?
Milli's gonna break up with Chris.
Shut up.
Oh, my God, that's gonna super weird when they move in together.
Yeah, I don't know when, but she is definitely gonna do it.
Nice.
Hey, Ron.
Were you trying to get a seven?
Because if you were, you did a great job.
I am very angry right now.
What?
My finger was in there.
Ron crushed my finger.
I think it might be broken.
- Are you a female bird?
- It was an accident.
Oh, my God, it's already swollen.
Tom, my God, do you have any pride at all?
You did this on purpose.
You're jealous of my gift.
Okay, come on, Tweety Bird, let's get you some ice.
- It hurts.
- Come on.
Well, congratulations, man.
Fun match, fun game, good times.
Did you have fun?
Yeah.
I'm not one to complain about free beer and free bowling.
See you around.
Okay.
Uh, just one second.
I'm running for city council, as you know, and uh, just wondering, do I have your vote?
- No.
- Derek.
You old so-and-so.
For reals, can I count on your vote?
Yeah, no, um, I don't think so.
But we've been here bowling all night, and we've been having fun.
And you're still not gonna vote for me?
Why?
- I don't like you, okay?
- Leslie, Leslie.
Well, you're a crappy bowler, and I pretended to lose to you.
Yeah, right.
I destroyed you.
No, it's true.
I am a really good bowler.
Ask Ron.
I don't know who Ron is.
But if you're so great, let's play again.
Good.
I'd love to.
Tell you what, if I win, I get your vote.
If I win, you clean my house for a month.
- Done.
- Hey, Leslie.
I'd like to introduce you to my good friend, anyone else.
Not now, Ben.
I'd like to introduce Derek's ass to my foot.
Get me another beer.
I don't work here.
$20?
Thank you.
Uh, you know, we're really looking for donations more in the $10,000 range.
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.
Just one second.
Let me get off this call.
Hi, I'm so sorry.
I'm back.
What, champion?
You need to go outside now?
Come on.
That a boy.
Sorry, he's hates awkward situations.
Oh!
- Terrible moonwalk.
- Don't care.
Yeah, what's up now, huh?
Aw, you got a spare.
That's so cute.
Check out the scoreboard.
So Millicent and I are going to take a nice little stroll, and I'll be back soon.
You know, if you want to take the rest of the night off, you know, that would be fine.
Well, I don't think that will be necessary.
Unless you also want to go get dinner.
Nope, this won't take too long.
Chris, you might want to take a jacket with you.
It's about to get cold out there.
Thanks, Donna, but Millicent's company will keep me warm.
Take the jacket.
I wished for his happiness to go away.
I might be a wizard.
Hey, Derek.
What a defeat, man.
I mean, I did not expect to win by that much.
But I warned you, I am a good bowler.
- Whatever.
- All joking aside, I wanna say that I actually had fun.
And I'm really looking forward to your vote in the spring.
Yeah, I'll just write in "bitch".
I'm sorry, what did you just say?
Just ignore him.
He's being a jerk.
I said she's a bitch.
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell?
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
That was awesome.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, look.
Here's that photo op you wanted.
- Ow.
- Sorry.
So you know that's everything that happens so it was just what happened.
It was just like - What's wrong with you?
- I don't know, I just I have a lot of adrenaline right now.
Just take a few deep breaths, okay?
The guy said he might press charges.
Yeah, well, Randy, I would like you to know that we will not be pressing charges.
Yeah, that really wasn't an option.
Come on, the guy was being a total jerk.
What Ben did was warranted and extremely awesome, by the way.
Did you write down how awesome it was?
When we write official reports, we refrain from using words like "jerk" or "awesome".
- Hey, here you go.
- Hey.
Wow, you and me, huh?
Hurt "fingies".
No, no, two totally different injuries.
Okay, you just hang in there, okay?
Okay, love you too.
Bye-bye.
Well, that was Milli.
It happened.
She broke up with Chris.
- Boo.
- Damn you, Jerry.
It's not my fault.
Well, I feel sorry for the man.
Well, anyway, the fundraising challenge is over, and the winner whoa.
We have a surprise winner, April.
April wins two tickets to the pawnee mono-plex.
- Yes.
- That's my wife.
Okay, everything's settled here.
Wanna head home?
No.
We haven't finished yet.
Last frame, your turn.
- He hurt his hand.
- Last frame, go.
- Fine, I'll bowl one-handed, like an idiot.
Whoo!
Oh, come on.
King Kong ain't got nothing on me.
Ow, my "fingie" still hurts.
Oh, the bravery.
The perseverance.
You're an American hero.
And the best part is, beautiful, you get to drive the champion home.
Well, the headline I would've gone with is "no-strike-bowling bowler struck by Knope's striking beau".
Okay, one more time.
Let me resign.
It's the only thing that truly protects you.
- Non-starter.
- Okay.
- Now when you take questions, I think you should be brief and sincere.
Don't try to justify what I did.
Just apologize again, and stay on script.
Are you sure that you don't need more whipped cream?
Not today.
I don't deserve it.
I got us into this mess because I was fixating on that guy.
But this is ridiculous.
I do need more whipped cream.
Ma'am.
Hi.
April Ludgate.
How are you doing?
Uh, whatever.
I'm fine.
Um, how are you?
Well, as you may know, Millicent Gergich ended our relationship last night, which was disappointing.
But here's why it may be the greatest thing that ever happened.
Yeah, good point.
Hadn't thought about it that way.
Um, here.
Take these tickets.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Y-you earned them.
They're movie tickets, Chris.
They're, like, 8 bucks.
It's a gesture.
There are three of them.
I thought there were only two.
Yeah, I know, I bought another one because I thought that maybe you, me, and Andy could go to the movies sometime.
Just take the stupid tickets.
I'm just trying to be nice.
- Thank you.
- There you go.
Okay, bye.
Leslie, are you going to fire Ben Wyatt?
Are you going to suspend your campaign?
I'd like to first start by saying thank you for coming.
And on behalf of Ben Wyatt and everyone involved in my campaign, I'm very sorry for what happened at the rock n' roll bowling alley last night.
You know what?
No, I'm not.
- I - I'm not sorry.
This guy was drunk, and he was aggressive.
And he was rude, and he was foul-mouthed.
And he called me by my second least favorite term for a woman, and my campaign manager punched him.
I do not condone violence, but I have to be honest, it was awesome.
And my campaign manager and I made out a lot afterward.
Ah, I probably shouldn't have said that.
But that's what happened.
Derek hates me, and I don't particularly like him.
So what's the point, right, Derek?
I feel like you're being kind of a bitch right now.
See?
So I'm not going to apologize.
And if people won't vote for me because of that, well, there's nothing I can do about it.
But you should be warned.
If you do not vote for me, my boyfriend might beat you up.
Now if anyone has any questions about the issues facing our city, I'm right here.
Okay, what are your overall impressions of this woman?
What do you like about her?
What don't you like about her?
- I like her.
- What do you like about her specifically?
I don't know.
She's tough, I guess.
I just like her.
I like that that one guy punched that other guy, and then I like that she stood by him.
See?
People vote with their gut.
Yeah, that guy said he didn't like my earrings.
Go punch him.
Sure.
Here you go.
Lane eight.
No, Lane 22.
The one at the very end.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, perfect game.
What's your name?
Put it up on a wall.
I was never here, and you will never speak of this again
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Okay, time for gifts.
We have gift certificates for facials everybody, then you're gonna get a needlepoint pillow with your face on it and a news headline from a newspaper on the day you were born.
"Joseph Stalin dies"?
That's right, Mom, and you replaced him.
Though not in terms of genocide.
Just in terms of, you know, being on earth.
February 14th, Valentine's Day, is about romance, but February 13th, galentine's day, is about celebrating lady friends.
It's wonderful, and it should be a national holiday.
It should be a national holiday.
Dear Congress, it's Leslie again.
Let's talk about personal relationships.
Who wants to start?
Donna?
I have several men in rotation.
One's waiting for me out in the car.
Don't worry, I rolled down the window.
April, you're the old married broad here.
- How's Andy?
- Well Last week he was supposed to buy gas, but instead he bought novelty cookie cutters.
Now everything we eat is shaped like a dinosaur.
He's amazing.
Great.
And mom, how's it going with Steven?
Well, I met him on the Internet because of my lovely daughter, and we are compatible.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.
Ann, can you start talking?
Well, I'm--I'm--I'm in a bit of a lull right now, but I'm so glad that you all have people in your lives that you care about, so Congrats!
It's really hard to say congrats without sounding sarcastic.
Seriously, I really hope you guys are all very happy-- - Damn it.
- We are.
Ann, I just wanted to say I'm sorry if I put you on the spot when I asked you about your love life.
How are you doing?
You know, I'm mostly fine being single.
It's just this time of year with the hearts and roses, it just gets me a little down.
But galentine's day made me feel better, so thanks.
Oh, Ann, you beautiful spinster.
I will find you love.
What?
Did you say something?
Love you.
Thank you all for being here.
Let's get started.
Wow.
Great attitude, Ron.
Sorry, I was talking to these ribs.
Okay, so the Valentine's Day dance is planned, prepped, and under budget, but we have one final task.
Ann Perkins is currently attending the Valentine's Day dance alone, so I need each one of you to bring an eligible bachelor for her tomorrow.
Ann's not totally hideous.
Why does she need our help?
Because that's what friends do, April.
They help friends find happiness.
Now the last guy she liked was Chris, but she can't date him again because he's her boss.
So when we're thinking of prospective sweethearts, we need to think of people who are Attractive and smart and kind.
And if you're wondering what kind of guy is right for Ann, all you need to do is ask.
Also you need to find someone educated, and friendly, and fun-- - just tell us the damn word.
Effervescent, he needs to be effervescent.
Quick question about Ann-- does anyone know if she has any indian in her?
No one respond.
- No one say anything.
- Why?
I'm just curious if Ann - has a little indian in her.
- Silence.
- I don't think she does.
- Would she like some?
Jerry!
Happy Valentine's Day.
- AndOoh-ah!
- Yachter Otter?
- Yup.
Two months ago, I have a dream about a playboy otter lost at sea, and you make him real?
- Uh-huh.
- I love it.
I thought we had agreed that we weren't gonna get each other presents 'cause we were too busy with the campaign-- I got you something too.
Oh, a bomb?
It is a cryptex, like in that movie The Da Vinci Code, which was the first movie that you and I ever watched - on Starz HD.
- Wow, that's specific.
Inside it will tell you where to meet me at 9:00 P.M. tonight, and the combination is a five-letter code that captures the essence of our third date.
- Yeah - So I will see you tonight.
UnlessYou can't crack the code.
I think I can crack the code.
I have no idea what the code is.
Hey, man, you okay?
Still thinking about your ex?
Millicent Gergich has literally torn my heart from my body and replaced it with a thick slab of sadness.
I may never smile again.
Cool, so I found a DJ for the dance, and his name is DJ Bluntz.
Tom, this is a publicly funded couples dance.
I don't think it's appropriate for people to be getting "wet with sound".
Who's gonna do it, then?
I will.
I certainly have no other plans for Valentine's Day, because I am completely alone.
All right, I'll see you later, Chris.
Aw, cool cryptex, can I have it?
Hey, no.
No, you can't-- Where'd you get it?
How do you know what a cryptex is?
I know what things are.
Well, Leslie hid the location of our Valentine's meeting place - in here.
- No.
I tried every five-letter word that has anything to do with our third date.
Have you tried ?
That's a four-letter word.
Oh.
Add an "s"?
I really don't think it's that.
Uh, I wish I could help you, bro, I don't know if I can.
You're, like, the second smartest guy I know.
You should go to the first smartest guy I know.
Okay, so the clue is inside, but it takes a five-letter code to open it-- Andy!
Did you try ?
Ha!
Yes, why is that everyone's first suggestion?
Just smart people.
I think I might be able to help you.
Told you.
- Let me see it!
- Yeah, you're gonna see it.
I'll show you.
I can unroll it.
"The murals with this heart you see, look to the first, and there your next clue will be".
The first letter of the name of each mural with a heart on it will spell out the clue.
Or some-- or something.
Let's check out the murals.
Happy Valentine's Day, Pawnee.
For me, it is not happy.
But don't let my sadness diminish your night.
Anyway, life is fleeting.
Leslie.
Found a date for Ann.
Jerry, well done.
I put an ad on Craigslist: "Man seeking man for a night of casual fun".
Enrico, he responded right away.
- I'll meet you inside, okay?
- Okay.
You hired a male escort.
A what?
Please get your gigolo out of here.
I-- uh-- oh, my God.
Okay, so we've got all the ones from this side with the heart sticker.
All right, the ones from the other hallway are "Cornfield Slaughter," "Lament of the Buffalo," "Needless Slaughter," "Slaughter Gone Wrong," "Eating the Reverend," "It's Raining Blood," - and "Death Everywhere".
- Great.
I got it from here.
Thanks, guys.
I hope I didn't screw up your Valentine's Day too much.
Oh, God, no.
April hates Valentine's Day.
And brunch.
And outside.
And smiling.
- She's weird.
- Wait.
I figured it out.
The letters unscrambled say, "No food finer.
Clue three at J.J.'s Diner".
How many clues are there, exactly?
Hey, you're here.
And I brought a bachelor.
- Are you kidding me?
- No.
You brought Orin?
Ann is not some weird, morose mummy.
Offense intended, Orin.
Let this be a wake-up call about the way you present yourself to the world.
I think Ann and him would be cute together.
I ask you to do one thing.
Do you know how hard I've been working to try to pull this together before Ann gets here?
- Hey.
- Hey, you're here.
We weren't talking about you.
- How are you?
- Well It's Valentine's Day, and I'm single, and I'm at a couples dance.
I can't imagine a more depressing place to be.
What about a wedding where you used to go out with the groom, and you're the only one there without a date, so the bride makes you dance to Single Ladies by yourself?
Oh, my God, did that happen to you?
Maybe.
Let's get a drink, and then you and I are gonna have some f-u-n.
Well, at least the music seems about right.
There was supposed to be, like, 20 guys here for Ann, and there's only four.
Who else do we have?
Ben, taken.
Jerry, taken.
Oh!
My dentist Is 80, and he's gay, and he's taken.
Uh what's this?
P. Hut?
Oh, Pizza Hut!
Hold on Hi, how cute are you?
Ann, this is my lawyer friend, Alex.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you - In the last hour.
- Yeah.
Well, Alex gives my campaign legal advice, and Ann is the greatest human being ever invented.
So I'm gonna-- what?
Uh, someone needs me.
I'm gonna go, and you two just hit it off now.
- You crazy kids.
- Okay Okay"There is no food finer".
For Leslie, that means whipped cream, or No, it's whipped cream.
I'm gonna look in the whipped cream cans.
Oh, got some!
Oh Nothing yet.
Okay, "something wicked this way comes," "whence you peruse a book with your thumbs.
"Go to the one who succumbs.
I'll be attached with a little gum".
Oh, come on, Leslie, gimme a break.
I hate riddles and other such nonsense, I want that on the record.
But something wicked with a book is my ex-wife, from the library.
Which means I'm the one that succumbs.
Uh"I'll be attached with a little gum".
Good God.
That woman is good.
"Follow me to the sheltered snow.
Only 22 clues left to go".
Well, this is the woman I've chosen to love.
Well, I guess there's nothing to do but spend the entire night methodically solving this puzzle.
There's no way we'll finish in time.
Okay, I'll just make a list of places she and I have been together, and hope we luck out and find the last clue.
We'll split up, cover more ground.
Move.
Hey, Kriss Kross, can we change up the music?
It kind of sounds like the end of a movie about a monk who killed himself.
- It is.
- Listen, man There's some attractive women here.
Why don't you rebound?
Nobody here compares to Millicent.
Except maybe Jerry.
Technically they share 50% of the same DNA.
Stop staring at Jerry like that.
I don't know.
It's working now.
Hey, how's it going?
It's Valentine's Day, and I'm working the late shift of the snow globe museum, so I'm right where I wanna be.
Okay, um, my girlfriend left a clue here, I think.
Like, for a scavenger hunt.
- Right.
You're Ben.
- Yes.
She said you'd be here by noon.
Not doing so good.
All right, well.
Thanks, Kevin.
I'm supposed to tell you that it's under one of the snow globes.
But which one?
Ooh, I don't know.
Nope.
No.
No.
You really suck at this.
Okay, why don't you just Tell me where it is and I can get out of here?
That would take all the fun out of it.
- Ah!
- Winner.
Ah, ha, ha, ha.
I found it.
Yep.
Oh, wait.
No, that might be from another scavenger hunt.
Ann, looks like you already met Jeff.
Well, you didn't tell me that your friend was so beautiful.
Aww, thanks, Jeff.
Not as beautiful as my sister, but you know the law.
- What?
- No, Jeff.
How am I supposed to find the love of Ann's life when it sounds like a funeral in here?
There's no changing it as long as Chris is depressed.
I'm gonna go talk to Chris.
You go help Ann.
She's not responding to my top candidates, so we're gonna have to go with some wild cards.
- Got it.
- And April Thanks for nothing.
Why should I do anything to help her?
Because despite the fact that all you do is give her a hard time, she would do this for you.
Just go hide under the table with your friend Orin.
Yeah, I see you, weirdo.
So Leslie dragged you into this sneaky little fix-up scheme, huh?
We're stuck at a Parks and Rec community couples event.
What else you gotta do?
What the hell.
You're right.
Bring 'em on, Tom.
I'm Harris.
Heard you were desperate for a man-piece.
We in business?
He's 33 years old, still lives with his parents, and he's been to at least Try 308.
I'm gonna have to pass right now.
Your mistake, mama.
So, Bill, this stunning woman saves lives for a living.
What do you bring to the table?
Uh, where to begin?
Uh, I'm an amateur juggler-- Nope, you shouldn't have begun there.
Get out.
No one's trying to get with jugglers.
Thanks for playing.
Hello, my name is Ron Swanson.
I believe Leslie Knope may have left some kind of scavenger hunt clue here.
She did.
One second.
Gentlemen.
Ah-- .
Enjoy your evening.
Well it always says "Break glass in case of an emergency".
Wait a second.
Well, there we go.
Hey, Chris, what do you think about changing the music?
Sure.
Ugh.
Hey, you know what?
You should look on the bright side.
I'm sure that Millicent couldn't keep up with you on your runs, so now you can go full speed again.
On the contrary, she was faster than I was.
I set many personal bests just trying to keep up with her.
Which is what I'm worried about.
What if she was my personal best?
No, your best is still ahead of you.
I am 44 years old.
You don't look a day over 30.
Most people say 25.
- Who says that?
- Lot of people.
You don't think that Millicent was my soul mate?
There are a lot of soul mates in the world.
I mean, look at Ann.
You dated her, and she's a perfect human specimen, and you tossed her out like day-old chowder.
But it's gonna be okay.
Buck up.
Thanks, I'll try.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How is your evening unfolding in terms of your conversations with men?
I have met a lot of different guys tonight.
How lucky that that happened to you - on Valentine's Day.
- What's lucky is that I have a best friend who spent her Valentine's Day trying to find me a date.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go home.
No.
Stay.
I just-- I'm gonna go home and watch TV.
Okay, well, can you just do me a favor and give me your car keys for a second?
There's something I need to look at on your car keys.
You're gonna throw them on the roof again - so I can't leave.
- You know me too well.
You're the best.
It sucks being alone on Valentine's Day, so I'm gonna take Ann out for a drink, you know.
Try to cheer her up.
And I can be late meeting Ben.
He's not gonna be on time, 'cause those clues are hard.
They're really, really hard, and I'm really worried that he's not gonna be able to figure it out.
Ann, you tricky bastard.
- Leslie, what are you doing?
- Look at Ann.
She's putting on makeup.
She using the emergency mini curling iron that I gave her.
- She has a date.
- You don't know that.
Why wouldn't she tell me who it is?
Because she doesn't want me to know.
Because it's someone she shouldn't be dating.
Wait, the music's better.
Have you seen Chris?
I don't know, maybe he's in the bathroom or something.
She's going to meet Chris.
Hey, I got nine, three and four.
I have 11, 12, 13, 14, Whoa.
I got-- I got lucky.
And I love riddles.
Yo, found some clues.
Also found this.
Weird stick.
Might be a clue.
- No.
- Okay.
Did you find the 25th clue?
No, I got #8, and #22.
What do you want, April?
Leave Ann alone.
This is none of your business.
After all the hoops that Ben and I had to jump through because of the boss-employee thing, it is absolutely my business.
Chris needs to explain himself, and Ann lied to me about this date.
I mean, so many injustices.
Ann would never do anything to piss you off, Leslie.
You guys are such close friends, it's lame.
Just have a nice night with Ben, and forget about this.
Okay, fine.
I will let it go for now.
But I want you to know that I think there is some--  Okay, she hung up on me.
We failed.
If I just had a little more time.
She's waiting for me somewhere in Pawnee, - and I'm not gonna be there.
- Wait Leslie loves romance, but she also loves being right.
Is there something you used to disagree on, but you've since come around to her way of thinking?
Ron, you're a genius.
Little Sebastian.
At first you did not understand what made this tiny horse so special, and now you love him more than I do.
Yep, I miss him every day.
I really tried to make that hard.
I'm very impressed with you.
Eh, some of them were kind of tough.
So are you ready to go have our first ever Valentine's dinner?
Yes, but I have to tell you something.
Chris and Ann are on a secret date.
Which is crazy because he's her boss, which is the exact situation we were in, except we were put on trial for it.
And I know I'm not supposed to care, and I'm supposed to let it go, and we should just have a romantic dinner-- No, we have to go catch them in the act.
- Right now.
- Really?
Yeah.
Screw romantic dinners.
Let's go rub it in their face.
God, I love you so much.
I cannot wait to see the look on Chris' remarkably youthful face when we march in there and confront him-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Leslie.
What?
Ahh!
Shh.
- Shh.
- April.
- Hey.
- April.
- Tom and Ann are on a date.
- I know.
What do you mean you know?
How do you know?
Because I set them up.
I was watching Ann with Tom at the dance and she seemed to be having a good time.
So I went over to talk to her.
What are you looking for in a date anyway?
I don't know.
What does anyone want?
Just a nice, funny guy who likes me and treats me well.
Tom's funny, and he'd treat you well.
- Ha, ha.
- I'm serious.
You want a good date, why not ask out the only guy that's made you smile tonight?
He's ridiculous.
- All that dumb swagger.
- It's not.
He's sweet.
You should just ask him out for a drink.
I'm 1,000% sure he'd say yes.
I bet you guys would have a good time.
Man, I need to, like, wrap my head around this.
Why?
It makes sense to me.
This is a small, loser town with loser people, and Tom's, like, at least semi-cool.
You know what I'm hearing?
You tried to make Ann happy for Valentine's Day.
- Ugh.
- You're a very nice person.
- No.
- Yes, you are.
- Very nice person.
- Bye.
I do not understand this.
This really confuses me.
Well, you do love them both.
Yeah, I love passionate speakers and Italian men.
Doesn't mean I love Mussolini.
You love Italian men?
Not as much as Irish Scottish?
White whatever you are.
This is the weirdest Valentine's Day ever.
So, Ann, it's finally happening.
Dude, this is so close to falling apart.
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Can I be honest, though?
I'm a little freaked out.
Like, I don't really understand what's going on.
This is what's going on-- we're gonna have a drink, and we're gonna talk, get to know each other.
And then I am going to drive home alone.
Cool.
Consider this alternate plan-- we have drinks here, get to know each other, whatever.
Then we go back to my place and snuggle up Like little bunnies.
- Yeah, this was a mistake.
- No!
Leslie, thanks to your annoying prying last year, I'm sure you remember my birthday's coming up.
I know, I know.
No parties, you hate parties.
Correct.
Oh, you know that wild goose chase you sent Ben on for Valentine's Day?
The scavenger hunt?
- I also do not want that.
- Yep, I understand.
I absolutely do not want to solve a series of riddles and clues, each more intricate than the last.
You understand what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I got it, Ron.
- Good.
Uh, I-I do want that.
Please do that for me.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
- Oh, God.
- Hey, Boo-boo bear.
What did you just call me?
- Boo-boo bear.
- Oh.
It's one of several nicknames I made up for you, and you can choose which one you like best, 'cause I want this to be a give and take.
Okay, we went out once, and nothing happened.
There is no "this".
We have "cookie tush" Wow, just right out the gate.
"Winnie the boo," "Lady presh-presh," "Ann-Berry sauce," "Annie get your boo," "Tommy's girl," "Annie banannie--" Hey!
All right, let's do this.
What are you doing?
Is this not one of those?
I might have misread the vibe.
Oh, my God, dude, you have to be cooler about this.
Look, I told Leslie because she's my best friend, but if anybody finds out about this and they start jabbering, it's gonna make it really hard to know if this is actually anything, so just keep it on the DL, okay?
I feel like you're embarrassed by me.
That is accurate.
Can I at least change my Facebook status to "In a relationship"?
Definitely not.
"It's complicated"?
Whatever.
Am I in a relationship?
It's complicated.
Chief Trumple, nice to see you.
- Hi, - Hey, Knope.
Wyatt.
Been a long time, eh, cap'n?
Or Captain.
"Oh, Captain, my Captain"!
From Dead Poets' Society.
- You getting weird already?
- Nope, I'm good.
Pawnee's police chief is retiring, and I'm trying to get his endorsement before he goes.
I'm really nervous because I need this for my campaign.
And Ben is really nervous because he is afraid of cops.
I'm not afraid of cops.
I have no reason to be.
I never break any laws, ever Because I'm deathly afraid of cops.
Look, Knope, I've always liked you.
But the Newports run this town.
And frankly, they've donated a lot of money to the department.
Mo' money, mo' problems, that's what I always say.
How about "mo' money, more protective kevlar vests" - that save lives"?
- I-I Sometimes I say that, too.
I understand you need to think about it, but if you were going to make a decision-- The guys are throwing me a little retirement thing tonight at O'Flynnigans.
There's gonna be beer.
So why don't you swing by?
I'll give you an answer.
Weirdo can come, too.
- All right.
- Let's go.
- Oh, hey, uh, may I say - Don't.
- That the boys in blue - Stop.
are heroes?
Obviously some more than others.
Oh, boy, here it comes.
- And we're walking.
- Okay.
Listen up, people.
This is very serious.
Jerry, if you're eating, you're not listening.
Thanks, babe.
I don't know how many of you have heard, but there's a flesh-eating virus going around.
Yeah.
It's called "music," and there's only one way to get a vaccine, and that is to play it.
To play the-- you get an injection-- Just say your piece, son.
I have finished writing Leslie's campaign anthem.
It's called Catch Your Dream, and it's amazing.
It's kind of like We Are The World, except I actually think it could have a real impact on society.
Here's the thing--we need backup singers, and I thought, "who better to be backup singers than Leslie's campaign team"?
Everyone's got something they're in charge of for Leslie's campaign.
My job is the song.
She originally put me in charge of hot dogs at this fund-raising barbecue, and I dropped them all-- all of them, like a thousand, so I really want to do a good job.
So we're gonna record this bitch tonight, Doubletime Studio.
Doubletime, you said?
Little brick building over on Liondale Road?
Yeah, you know the one?
No.
You could not keep it together in there.
I know.
I'm sorry.
But I'm fine now, as long as we get out of here as quickly as possible and never come back.
Hey, Leslie!
Oh!
- Dave.
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.
Wow.
- Hey.
You look great.
San Diego sun Got me all tanned up.
- So what are you-- oh, sorry.
Um, Ben, this, uh-- this is my-- this is Dave Sanderson.
- Oh, hey.
- Nice to meet you.
Uh, yes, uh, Leslie Knope is a female person with whom I was involved.
We had a romantic-- "romantical" involvement until I relocated to San Diego, which is-- that's in California, which is southwest of here by a number of miles.
So we terminated our involvement at that time.
Are you here for a while?
No, just tonight, for the chief's retirement thing.
Oh, yeah, we're going to that, too, actually, but we're gonna go a little later, 'cause first, we're going to have dinner at a really nice new French restaurant.
Cool.
I'm gonna go to the gas station and get a frozen burrito and eat it right there at that table.
Well, see you later.
You should come to dinner with us.
Okay.
I shouldn't have invited him.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no, no-- No, that's okay.
I mean, I just feel like it's kind of odd for me and him to hang out with you.
Honestly, if you want to just go out with him alone, I'd be totally okay with it.
No, look, he's here for one night.
He's a really great guy, and he's gonna love you, which--bonus--will make all the other cops love you.
Dave is a great person, and he's a great judge of character.
Tonight he's going to endorse Ben, and Trumple is going to endorse me.
Double endorsement.
Ooh, that sounds like an Ashley Judd movie.
Studio's down here.
Let's go.
Hustle, people, come on.
Jerry Ah.
That's vandalism.
I have a problem.
This happens to be the studio where a local saxophone legend named Duke Silver records his albums.
I've heard of him.
I heard he makes mature women swoon when he plays.
From what I've heard about Duke, he's kind of a private guy.
He doesn't want his nosy coworkers discussing his music with him or knowing that he exists.
So, if you happen to see any memorabilia laying around, kindly and discreetly discard it.
- You got it, Duke.
- Don't call me that.
I dig your groovy tunes, man.
Did you hear me?
I said, "I dig your groovy tunes, man".
Yo, Chuck, we're going to go ahead and play and sing at the same time.
I want this to have the electricity of a live concert.
So we have to play it perfectly every time?
No, Burly, play it "unperfectly".
You mean imperfectly?
I mean perfectly.
- God, that was hot nonsense.
- Yeah.
Hey, uh, can I have a sip of that water?
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.
That's sweet.
The two of you sharing a nice bottle of-- - You told them.
-  What?
I asked you for one thing.
Fine.
I told them we went on a date.
- When?
- As soon as I possibly could.
I texted them while we were on the date.
-  - I'm sorry.
But you are too hot to hide, Ann.
This is on you.
Hey.
When you two spoon, who spoons who?
Ben's doing an amazing job as campaign manager.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
He's really smart.
You know, a campaign manager is only as good as the campaign person that he is managing.
So I'm trying to say you're a real smart lady.
Uh, you can say that again.
If anything, I'm holding her back.
Aw, Ben.
I said my thing first.
Actually, that's why we were at the police station today.
We're trying to get Chief Trumple's endorsement.
Oh, yeah?
Hugh's a buddy of mine.
I could probably get him to endorse you.
Oh, man, that would be amazing.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna use the bathroom.
Uh, you mean "the whiz palace".
Leslie calls it that sometimes.
I know.
It's kind of cute, right?
Yeah, that's real cute.
- So, how is San D-- - I'm still in love with you.
- What did you just say?
- Nothing.
I did--nuttin' was said.
Nuttin' was just now-- Did you just say you were still in love with me?
No, I don't think I said that.
Dave, why would you tell me that here and now?
Because it's accurate.
And because he's not here right now, so I thought this would be a good time.
Can I just please talk to you about this for five minutes?
No, you cannot bring this up at all when my boyfriend is here.
Okay, we'll get rid of him.
That's a good call.
No, bad call.
That's not the call.
Okay, if we leave now while he's in the whiz palace - No, listen to me.
Listen-- Hey.
Whizzingham manor.
It's another funny name for the bathroom That I thought of.
All: Catch your dream  All: and shackle it to your heart.
- Catch your-- - No, no, no, no, no.
Was that a joke?
Were you joking just now?
Because if so, that was hilariously awfully funny how bad that was.
Why don't you take and really think about whether or not you want to be part of this?
He's a gorgeous genius, people.
Don't question his methods.
Tom, am I to understand correctly that you are now romantically involved with Ann Perkins?
Tsk.
Oh, are you about to give me the whole "she's a great girl, I need to treat her right" speech, - since you guys used to date?
- No.
But she is, and you should.
I just had no idea, and so now I have to Adjust.
Tsk.
Okay, great talk.
Uh, how's work out there, Dave?
Pretty good.
Caught a lot of bad guys, about six bad guys.
So you're leaving tomorrow?
I'm scheduled to leave tomorrow on the 12:15 flight through Salt Lake City.
Oh, it was so good to see you.
- But I may be coming back.
- How's that, now?
- Well, I'm mainly here to interview for Trumple's job-- - Police chief.
- Dude, that's amazing.
You should totally be chief.
You could endorse Leslie.
I would definitely endorse Leslie.
You don't have to.
There's a lot of good candidates.
I think I'm gonna take a little--go outside.
You look like I could use some company.
- What?
- What?
Would you like to step outside with me and catch up?
We have caught up.
We talked about San Diego and about the six bad guys.
I think we're good.
I could take a little jaunt with you.
No, I don't want that.
Well, I'm already-- I already said I'm gonna go, so I guess--I'm a man of my word.
I'm gonna go.
- Take your time.
- Okay, thank you.
Okay, honestly, how do you think I'm doing?
'Cause I feel like we're getting along pretty well.
He said he's still in love with me.
What's that?
While you were in the bathroom, he said he was still in love with me.
Oh, my God.
Leslie, he's a cop.
He's in love with you, and he has a gun?
- Can you just not freak out?
- I'm not freaking out!
- Okay.
- I'm not freaking-- Uh  I know, that's--I know.
Uh, it was raining out, so I didn't want to get wet.
I got some hot tea with honey-- good for the voice.
I recommend you all try it.
Mine's really just a cup of honey, 'cause tea is gross.
Now, here's the thing-- we're gonna start from scratch.
We're gonna get rid of this whole sucky vibe.
I'm thinking we could-- Whoo!
To the man!
I was thinking, like, a crazy rock star vibe!
See where her head's at?
Follow her lead.
That was amazing.
Next thing, I want to hear how all of us sing on our own, so we can figure out where we're going wrong.
This is not an audition, so relax.
But if you don't sing good, you're out of here.
I think you sound like an angel, and everyone else sounds like demons.
I think you shouldn't whisper.
Yeah, Ann's mad at me now, but I have a few tricks up my sleeve.
I don't want to brag, but I have a ton of experience with women being mad at me.
Chris, you're first.
Sing anything you want.
- Let me hear it.
- Okay.
Take me out to the ball game take me out to the game I just want to be at the game I would like to eat at the game I'd like popcorn and candy and the home team at the game!
Boom.
And the check, as you requested.
Here's my credit card-- quick, now.
- Check?
- Yeah.
You like dessert.
Why don't you get a dessert?
Oh, dessert's overrated and gross.
Dave, thank you so much for a lovely evening.
Oh, actually, Ben, would you mind if I talked to Leslie alone?
Uh, actually, Dave, I'd like to talk to you.
I don't want to talk to you.
I want to talk to Leslie.
Well, I want to talk to you, and if not, then I'd like to talk to Leslie.
Well, I'd like to talk to Ben, and then I'd like the three of us to talk together.
Well, then I'll talk to Ben, and then you-- and then I'll talk to you, and then you'll talk to each other, and then we'll all three talk, then.
- All right.
- So who's talking now?
All: Catch your dream don't let it spread its wings and fly away Stop the song, stop the song right now!
Please, stop it!
Oh, for  sake.
Ann, I caught feelings for you, and I want you to be my girl, -  - And I don't care who knows.
I know you don't care, dummy.
I care.
Let's not get hung up on who wants what.
You know what?
I'm calling this.
We're done.
What about our next date?
If you want another date, keep walking away.
She's still walking.
I need you to know something, man-to-man.
I still have feelings for Leslie, in a womanly fashion, and I believe she feels the same towards me, in a manly way.
She doesn't feel the same way, because she has a boyfriend-- um, me, and--and-- and--and we love each other.
That's--that information is-- it's not pertinent - Well, I-- - Frankly, at this juncture.
I just said to you one thing, and you're "contraring" me.
I don't think that's a word.
I think we'd all appreciate it if you would just let me have three minutes with her alone.
Consequently, I'd like you to clear the area.
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna give my blessing for you to go and try and win my girlfriend away from me.
I think that that's reasonable.
Okay.
Okay, and I want to thank you.
I want to thank you for having this talk with me - Man-to-man.
- Oh, well, thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- What-- - what are you doing?
- I'm doing that.
Are you serious?
- You brought it on yourself.
- What?
I've got something I gotta say to you.
- Where's Ben?
- He left.
- He left?
- Yeah, he said, "I got somewhere I got to-- important to go, and I don't respect her as a woman".
He said that?
And he acted more effeminate than he does in front of you.
Just--look, I got some-- something to say, and it's emotional, and it's important.
I need 30 seconds.
Okay, what?
Go ahead.
What is it?
Okay.
Romance--  Hello?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I have to pee really bad, ironically.
What were you thinking?
I was thinking that I would cuff him, and--and then I could have time to speak to you, and then you would decide to be with me, and then I would come back here, and we would uncuff him together.
Can you just uncuff him, please?
Sorry.
Would you look at that?
Nature is throwing me a bone.
Haverford playbook move number two-- "ladies love a guy waiting for them in the rain".
- D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d  I never thought I'd say this to you, son, but you may be overthinking this.
This song has to be perfect, Ron, okay?
Leslie trusted me with it.
I can't come up with some brilliant political idea, can I?
This is the only way I can help.
Maybe if I hit my head against the ground.
That's worked before.
Leslie is going to love it, I promise.
No offense, Ron, but what do you know about music?
Mm.
Tsk.
Hey, take a walk.
Clear your head.
I bet it does you some good.
Ann?
Boo-boo?
I don't want to say, "I told you so," - but - What?
I was the one who didn't want to go.
I know.
I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
I'm sorry.
He was a very important person to me, and it mattered to me that he liked you, which is silly.
Let's just go home.
No, we're going to Trumple's thing.
No, let's not go there.
I don't care about the endorsement, and I don't want to put you through this any more.
You don't care about the endorsement?
Leslie, let's not let your terrible decision making get in the way of this election.
What happened to you?
I was waiting outside in the rain for you, 'cause I thought you would come out and be like, "aw, he's all wet.
That's so romantic," but you didn't, and now I got the "sniffness".
What on earth would make you think I would like that?
Movies.
Oh, God, Tom!
Why do you have to be so "you" all the time?
I'm sorry.
Will you help me get out of these wet clothes?
- Hey, you want a beer?
- Oh, okay.
If you're driving, I can't give you a beer.
Oh, well, then, no, thank you.
It's a celebration, man.
You have to have a drink.
I'll definitely have one.
Don't make a mistake you'll always regret.
Please, just tell me what you want me to do.
So, if you move here, I hope we can be friends, but I love Ben.
He comes first, and if you're going to act like an ass, I can't talk to you, ever.
Okay, that's fair.
I-I'm sorry.
That was dumb, all that stuff I did.
You just-- you make me crazy, and I guess I'm just surprised that-- you know, that's the guy you fell in love with.
He's very--well, he's shrimpy, and he's small.
Shrimpy or not He's smart, and he's cute, and he's kind, and he's funny, and he's got a great face and nice hair, and he's-- Okay, I get it.
I surrender.
-  - I just want to know that you're happy and you're protected.
I'm very happy.
And he's not shrimpy.
A few weeks ago, a guy called me a bitch in a bowling alley, and he punched him in the face.
Oh, good man.
I mean him, for doing that, not the guy who called you a bitch.
You tell me where he is.
I'll punch him, too.
All right, guys, here's the deal-- we got to completely start over.
I wrote a new song-- it's called The Promise Of Tomorrow's Wings.
It's brilliant-- about a billion times better than Catch Your Dreams, which I realize now sucks ass.
Hey, Chuck, go ahead and just delete everything, all right?
Hold on, Chuck.
Just listen to the song one more time, and then make a decision.
Where's that saxophone coming from?
I don't know.
I don't know the first thing about music.
Shackle it to your heart Whoa, is that a new mix?
It sounds way better.
See?
You just needed to clear your head.
Hey, you guys, who is this?
This looks just like--  Ow, that was loud.
I am telling you that Leslie, in the long run, is so much better for this police department than Bobby Newport is.
Gun!
No, no, no, no!
It's just a--it's paper.
It's--I was reaching for paper.
It's all right, boys.
Leslie has a plan to raise cops' pensions and increase benefits without cutting back on hours.
Newport's just gonna keep on buying you guys a couple new cars or some new uniforms, as always.
That guy's all about short-term solutions.
Pretty sweet sauce in there, eh, Ace?
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.
Trumple gave me the endorsement, which is great, but really, the only endorsement that matters is Ben's, and I locked that sucker up a long time ago.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm about endorse ten beers into my mouth, 'cause this has been an incredibly stressful evening.
Nice work, guys.
Hey, a little tradition after Mouse Rat records, someone buys me booze-- who's it gonna be?
All right, look, I know I messed up, but there's something I got to say to you.
No playbook, no gimmicks, just me, Tom, talking to you as a person.
Okay, I would like that.
Good, 'cause this is what I really want to say.
Baby, I'm sorry for how I acted but if you give me another chance I could be the boo of your dreams, girl so, when you're sleeping and you're dreamin' of a boo I want that boo to be me, I want me to be that boo so will you date me?
- I'm saying date me - Okay, yes.
Fine, fine, fine!
- Yes, I will.
- Baby, baby, baby, baby I will go out with you.
Enough, please!
- Really?
- Yes.
Dude, you wore me down.
Just stop singing, please.
The four sweetest words in the English language-- "You wore me down".
Go ahead.
Oh.
Go ahead.
Oh, hey, Dave, go ahead.
- Uh, go ahead.
No, it's fine.
- No, no, no.
You're waiting.
It's your turn.
No, no, I'm not.
- You're not waiting?
- No.
It feels like you're-- - I'm-- - It feels to me like you're being overly respectful of all these cops, and you're letting them go in - all in front of you.
- No, no, no.
I'm just standing here.
Why would you be standing just here?
- I w--I-- I was just checking-- Get in the-- go in!
Thank you so much.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
- Morning.
- Hey.
Hey, can you approve this new design for the campaign poster?
Oh, Ann, you beautiful, rule-breaking moth.
You know we can't talk about my campaign in here.
Seriously?
It's a "yes" or "no" question.
When you're running for office, there are, like, a million rules of what you can and cannot do.
Yes.
And because I work for the government, I am not allowed to do anything campaign-related inside a government building.
Boss, I need your Herbie Hancock on this.
Outside.
It's kind of a pain in the ass.
But it's great exercise But it's a pain in the ass.
So Perd Hapley wants to do Thursday now.
Fine.
Did you finish the maintenance report?
I did not finish it, but I will finish it.
So wait, what was your question again?
The slogan?
Okay, can I just come out there, so we can talk about everything?
No, April, I need to keep my work separate, okay?
Just think of it like a fun game.
Parks is inside.
Campaign is outside.
Parks is inside.
Campaign's outside.
Ooh, you know what would make it more fun?
- What?
- Oh, my God, this.
April.
### ### It's time, Leslie.
You have to take a leave of absence from the department.
Ron, that is ridiculous.
- We've talked about this.
- No, you've talked about it, and I've ignored it, because it is ridiculous.
Need I remind you that even if I win the election, I can still work at the Parks department.
City council is a part-time job.
But campaigning is a full-time job.
Right now you're working and 50 hours a week on the campaign.
Well, I have time to spare.
I'm also volunteering at "Wheels For Meals On Wheels".
We repair vans for "Meals On Wheels".
You're a month behind on everything.
You forgot to file the weekly Parks Maintenance report.
You do it every week, and you forgot.
Things are falling through the cracks.
I'm pretty sure you've worn that sweater four days in a row.
Or I own four identical versions of the same sweater.
No, you don't, there's an old lollipop that's been stuck to the back since Tuesday.
That's the style now, Ron.
It's called "lollipopping".
All the kids are doing it.
Leslie, you need to take a sabbatical.
Okay.
You know what, Ron?
I accept your apology, I will not take a sabbatical, as we agreed, and we will never discuss this again.
Sorry, Ann.
You can't open this gift.
It's for the most beautiful girl in Pawnee.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Hold up, hold up, wait.
That's you.
Wow.
Yeah, and look, I got one too.
Matching His and Hers.
So I'm "Tommy's girl," and you're just "Tom"?
Why not "Ann's man"?
Nobody owns me, cupcake, not even you.
You can either burn these hats in a fire, or you can use a blowtorch.
How about this option?
- We put the hats on-- - Don't say it.
We take everything else off.
These Kangol hats are exactly like the one Samuel L. Jackson wore to the Latin Grammys.
- How could she not like them?
- I don't know.
It's like somehow everything I do with her is wrong.
Dude, seriously, leave me out of this.
I kind of set up Tom and Ann, and now they won't stop asking me for advice, which is a really bad move on their part, because I really don't care what happens to them Or anyone.
Champion!
Hey, bud.
I missed you.
Thank you so much.
I hope he wasn't a handful.
Not in the slightest.
As the Germans would say, "er ist ein wunder hund".
- He is a wonder dog.
- Oh.
The dog training course I took was conducted entirely in German, and so now I'm fluent in German Words relating to dogs.
April and Andy went away for the night, and I looked after Champion here.
He's a mutt.
Half amazing, half terrific.
Ich bin ein three-legged dog.
Well, I took him to PetSmart.
I got him various toys, got him shots, got him groomed, and gave him plenty of exercise.
He's healthier than ever.
Wait, did his leg grow back?
Aw, no, no.
That's okay.
- Andy, if I may-- - Yes.
Dogs tend to take on the personalities - of their owners-- - Mm-hmm.
So if you were to sit on your couch all day watching cartoons and eating nothing but Cheetos, that's what he would want to do too.
Who wouldn't?
That sounds like an amazing day, right?
Okay, well, thanks.
Bye, Champion.
Morning, Leslie.
Jerry, take that shirt off.
You look ridiculous.
Gayle gave me this shirt yesterday as a birthday present.
Oh, my God, Jerry.
I can't believe I forgot your birthday.
Leslie, it is okay.
I mean, let's face it, it's a tough one to remember.
My birthday is February 29th, so I only get one real birthday, you know, once every four years.
But it's great because my wife Gayle makes such a big deal out of it.
We go, we split a huge piece of cotton candy cheesecake from Cakey J's Cheesecake Facility.
And then, well, we hold hands for a while.
We listen to some Anita Baker.
She meets up with some friends, and I turn in early.
This is unacceptable.
Birthdays are important.
I'm so sorry we forgot yours.
I guess it just slipped through the cracks.
Yes, I guess it did.
Anyway, Happy Birthday to Jerry.
You are a kind and wonderful soul.
Thank you.
Also I need you to do some fecal contamination testing - at the reservoir.
- Now?
Yes, go get a kit from maintenance, and I need you to check the water for bird dung.
Can I at least grab the gloves?
Jerry, what are you doing standing here?
- Our water has poop in it.
- Oh, my God.
Now Jerry is turning 64 this year.
- He's only 64?
- 64 divided by 4 is-- - 16.
- 64.
So we're gonna throw him a Sweet 16 surprise party.
It's gonna be very special.
- The usual, cake and pop?
- No, April, the unusual.
- Fish and pop.
- No.
- Cake and fish.
- No, no fish.
Jerry only gets a real birthday every four years.
And four years from now, who knows?
He might be retired Or dead.
Let's start a pool.
Who wants retied?
Who wants dead?
- Dead.
- No.
- I got one dead.
- No.
- You need to take that?
- Mm, no.
The campaign can wait, 'cause this is official Parks business.
Donna, can we use your lake house?
How did you know about that?
My family has a lake house up in the foothills, but we keep it quiet.
We're not big on hospitality.
The Meagles are a cold people.
Can we use your house?
I suppose.
Bring your own towels.
Wow, Donna.
This place is beautiful.
Yes, it is, and it will stay that way.
These are the house rules.
No dirty shoes in the house.
Upstairs is Meagle space only.
And if you listen closely, that is the bubbling of the hot tub.
You do not have access to it.
If you follow these rules, we won't have a problem.
Oh, my God.
- Is that Ginuwine?
- Mm-hmm.
Why do you have Ginuwine's platinum record on your wall?
Why do you have a photo of you with Ginuwine at some place?
Oh, have I never talked about this before?
Ginuwine's my cousin.
Ginuwine?
The Ginuwine is your cousin?
How do I not know this?
Who's Ginuwine?
Ginuwine?
Ginuwine is Ginuwine.
He's Ginuwine.
Saying his name over and over again is not going to help me.
He's an R&B singer.
Pony, Differences.
Do you really not know who Ginuwine is?
I know that he's Donna's cousin.
When I'm dating someone, I have a list called my "oh-no-nos".
A woman commits an "oh-no-no," it can end the relationship.
Not loving '90s R&B music is number three on the "oh-no-nos" list.
Girl doesn't even know who Ginuwine is.
Hey, boy.
How was the ride?
Oh, hey, you want me to show you something?
Okay.
Platz.
Steh Auf.
See, it's pretty cool, huh?
Would you like me to teach you?
Uh, whatever.
I mean, anybody can do that.
Toxic.
Merkel.
- Merkel.
- What is "Merkel"?
She's the Chancellor of Germany.
Not only more jobs but better jobs.
I just did a phone interview while simultaneously decorating this house for Jerry's surprise party.
Totally multitasking, totally on top of all of it.
Crow for dinner tonight, Mr. Swanson?
Okay, we are locked and loaded.
Music is ready.
Slideshow is prepped.
- April, when does Jerry arrive?
- How would I know?
Who was supposed to invite Jerry?
Guys, someone was supposed to invite Jerry.
It's his surp-- Crap, it was me.
I forgot to invite Jerry.
You need to take a sabbatical.
I'm not taking a sabbatical.
Is this because I forgot to invite Jerry - to his own birthday party?
- It did seem like an oversight.
I have a prediction, Ron.
By the end of the night, you are going to take a bite of Jerry's cake, which incidentally, we need to pick up on the way home, and you are gonna say, "sabbatical, schmabbatical.
Leslie can do it all.
She's the best, and I'm stupid".
That does sound like me.
Hey.
Here's a fun game.
Let's talk minimum acceptable thread count for sheets.
- Ooh, that does sound fun.
- Stop me when I hit it.
Ann, I'm at 600.
Are you really not stopping me?
I have those cotton t-shirt sheets.
Huh?
It's always the most beautiful ladies who hurt you the worst.
She's never seen a single Paul Walker movie?
That's a huge "oh-no-no".
She also "doesn't care" about Blu-ray?
- She's a monster.
- April, this is serious.
I might have to break up with Ann.
Yeah, well, then break up with her.
But she's my dream girl.
Then don't break up with her.
Except she hates everything I like.
I own more pairs of Uggs than she does.
I was getting kind of sick of listening to Tom and Ann talk about their relationship, but then I remembered that alcohol existed.
Thank you, alcohol.
Jerry?
Jerry.
Where the hell could he be?
Maybe someone else had a surprise party and actually remembered to invite him.
Jerry?
Jerry.
Jerry?
Jerry!
Come on in.
- Oh, God.
- Leslie.
Hello, Jerry.
Jerry, why did you call us in here?
Well, because I thought you were Gayle.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
Yes, Leslie, what are we doing in Jerry's bathroom?
There is a Parks emergency that only you can help us solve, so we need you to get out of the tub.
Let's get going.
O-okay, jes--w-- I gotta get dressed.
- No, there's no time.
- There's time, Jerry.
Get dressed.
Okay, well, what is the big emergency?
Oh, did we lose more seniors in the woods?
No, it's a sinkhole, right?
Crap on a catapult.
They screwed up my campaign signs.
Now I gotta deal with this.
Okay, but what about the sinkhole?
Don't worry, Leslie will deal with this and the sinkhole.
Right, Leslie?
Yes, Ron.
I will, Ron.
And I shall do it with aplomb.
What the hell is wrong with Tom?
Don't know.
It's like I'm dating some idiotic game show host.
He is driving me crazy with these stupid questions.
Well, soon it won't matter.
Why?
What did he tell you?
Nothing.
Wait, is he gonna break up with me?
I don't know.
I'm-- No, no, no, no, no, no.
No.
That's not how this ends, okay?
I break up with him.
I think I will celebrate with a drink.
Quit pulling.
Fine, I'll let you off the leash.
- Andy.
- What the , dude?
Where did you come from?
I think that Champion should stay on his leash.
There's unfamiliar terrain and strange smells.
No, leashes are just for dogs that bite people.
That's not true.
Chris, Champion's my dog, okay?
He's not going anywhere.
Sometimes you just have to let a dog be a dog.
He'll be all right.
Champion!
He'll come back.
So as you can imagine, we would never have ordered a sign with all this complicated nonsense because, you know, we're not insane.
See right here on the order form?
- Mm-hmm.
- I can read the sign.
- It does.
- ".com/imagescmyk/--" - well, but this isn't what-- - "page/carnpaignlqty100123--" You don't need to read the whole thing.
- "9u/09230023--" - Mm-hmm.
"099twposter--" - it does say that.
- ".
jpeg".
Jpeg.
Yes, Walter, it does say that.
You're right, but using basic logic and human intelligence, one can surmise that this is a link to an image.
This isn't what we wanted printed on the signs.
Whatever's on the order form I print.
In this case, it was a long string of letters and numbers.
Can I just sh--show you something here?
There you go.
That's highly against protocol.
Well, here, look.
That's a good sign.
You should've used that.
You told April you were breaking up with me?
Ann, we consistently disagree on "who wore it best".
You still use an iPad one.
You read books all the time.
Okay, how about my "oh-no-nos" for you?
You make me see terrible movies, and then you talk through them.
"You put 20" rims on your volkswagen golf, and you insist on being introduced as "the brown Gosling".
Everything you just said makes me like me more.
I can't take it any more, okay?
I'm breaking you up.
You guys are done.
- Fine with me.
- Fine, fine.
- Oh, April.
- I'm drunk.
You made me drunk, you made me drunk, and you-- - No, no.
Give it a rest.
- I need it.
- Okay.
- Fine.
Let's get you to bed.
You know, why are you guys even fighting anyway?
It's so stupid.
"I hate Ann because of this stupid reason".
"And I hate Tom for this stupid reason".
Who cares?
- You want some help?
- No, I got it.
Well, we did everything, Ron.
We got new signs.
We put them in people's yards.
We got Jerry for the surprise-- sinkhole emergency.
And, uh, we briefly ran out of gas, and then we walked to the gas station.
We got more gas, and now we're all good.
Yep, you truly are attempting to do it all.
Thank you.
We didn't get to the drug store for my liver medication.
Well, you should've thought about that before we dragged you out of the bath, Jerry.
Yeah.
Okay, wait a second.
This is clearly not a sinkhole problem.
What's going on?
Jerry, as soon as we open this door, everything will become clear.
Surprise!
Oh, what the ?
Surprise.
Where the hell is everybody?
Well, it got so late.
We just weren't sure you were still coming.
Everybody's either in bed or out looking for Champion.
Oh, yeah.
Champion ran away.
- Wake everybody up.
- Leslie.
No, I am not gonna let this fall apart.
We are gonna throw Jerry an amazing Sweet 16 surprise party no matter how agonizing it is for all of us.
That's the spirit.
- Champion.
- Champion!
Champion, come here, boy.
I have an organic, gluten-free soy bone for you.
Champion!
Chris, there's something I have to tell you.
- I ate one of your soy bones.
- Really?
Yeah, it was really good.
I was gonna give it to Champion, but it just-- it looked so yummy.
The point is, I'm a terrible dog owner.
And I think, if we find Champion, you should keep him.
Andy, if it wasn't for you and April, Champion would still be back at the pound.
You gave him a home.
That's amazing.
And he's your dog.
If you just call out his name, he will come to you.
What--no, he won't 'cause I've been trying it, and it didn't work.
I think he likes your music.
Why don't you sing to him?
Really?
I don't have my guitar.
- I usually-- - Come on.
I feel naked without it, okay.
### Champion, you're lost ### ### and soon you'll be found ### ### I rescued you from the pound, ### something something ### ### oh man ### ### on the ground ### ### get on out of here ### Champion!
Champion, hey!
Oh, buddy, you came back.
You came back to my voice.
Dog whistle.
- April, wake up.
- Jerry's here.
April.
- April.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Why is your arm around her?
I broke you up.
Well, we got back together again 'cause of what you said.
What do you mean?
I didn't say anything.
Yeah, when we were carrying you to bed, you correctly pointed out that we were arguing about stuff that was stupid, and so we talked it out.
And I apologized, and he apologized.
And now everything's great.
- Thanks.
- No.
I'm drunk.
Don't listen to me, no.
- See you out there.
- No.
- Whoa, thanks, guys.
This is really-- this is really great.
Okay, I want everyone to go around and tell their favorite Jerry story.
A positive one.
Who's first?
Jerry, today is your birthday, but it's about much more than that.
It's also about Ann and I getting back together and being the hottest couple in Pawnee.
I'd also like to announce our official relationship mash-up name.
It's "Tan".
To Tan.
I would like to announce that the name Tan is officially over.
To the end of Tan.
- Haverkins it is.
- Okay, Donna?
I would like to address the fact that rule number seven says, "no pets," and yet there is a three-legged animal - in my living room.
- Okay, Ron.
Jerry's work is often adequate.
I'll go.
Jerry has a wife and three beautiful daughters-- a full life-- and that's amazing.
April and Andy have Champion, and that's amazing.
I have a stepbrother who lives in London and 2.8% body fat.
Guys guys What do I do?
I mean, she's asleep.
You probably should just sit there and not move.
She's really tired.
Just a few hours.
Few hours?
Is this all the eggs we have?
Yes.
What are you making?
Eggs.
- Leslie.
- Surprise!
Oh, God.
What happened?
Well, you slept with Jerry last night.
No, I was planning Jerry's morning surprise party.
Morning surprise parties are always the best.
- Let's get going.
- I made some coffee.
Let's go for a walk.
I now officially insist that you take a sabbatical.
- No, no.
- Let me finish.
I used to work in a sheet metal factory, but then a job came along at the tannery.
The hours were better, and I would get paid.
Also I'd have the chance to work with leather both before and after it was on the cow, which had always been a dream of mine.
I didn't want to give up my sheet metal job, so I tried to do both jobs and finish middle school.
How old were you?
The point is, I was so tired, I tried to puncture an eight-gauge aluminum foil with a leather awl.
- Wow.
- I learned a lesson.
Never half-ass two things.
Whole-ass one thing.
So if you want to win that seat-- Which I do.
Then commit yourself 100%.
Take a sabbatical.
I will cut back to 10 hours a week.
Deal.
- 15.
- 10.
Deal.
Ugh, I can't believe I got them back together.
Now they're always gonna want to come talk to me about stuff.
Eh, that's a good thing, babe.
They want to talk to you because you're important to them.
Yes, but I hate them.
I know you do, sweetheart.
Oh, hey, uh, by the way, I think that Chris is lonely, so I told him he could borrow Champion whenever.
- Andy, he's kissing me.
- Aww.
Jerry, I wanted to say I'm sorry that I screwed up your birthday party.
- Oh, that's okay.
- But we all pitched in.
And we are sending you and Gayle to a B&B in your favorite place in the world.
Muncie?
Amazingly, yes.
Muncie, Indiana.
Thank you, guys.
It was really expensive.
- Oh, campaign.
- Take it.
Excuse me.
If the Bread and Breakfast This is Leslie.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
This is "The Final Word with Perd".
With your host, Perderick L. Hapley.
Issue number one is the first issue we're going to talk about.
Is Bobby Newport's campaign for city council in trouble?
When I say your names, I want you to respond.
Dylan.
Well, Newport's poll numbers have been plummeting.
They just fired his campaign manager, and where's Bobby?
He's on vacation in Spain.
He's not on vacation, he's in hiding.
Every time the guy speaks, he puts his foot in his mouth.
That's a hilarious image.
A foot in a mouth.
It's a common expression.
Okay.
According to the newest polls, Leslie knope is now in second place.
She's just 15 points back.
Whoa, yeah!
How did she close the gap?
You have to give a lot of credit to her campaign manager, Ben Wyatt.
So apparently, Newport just fired his campaign manager because Ben was kicking his ass.
Ben is the best campaign manager anyone could ever have.
Every move he's made has worked.
He's like a brilliant, sexy, little hummingbird.
What did you just say?
Nothing.
Keep up the good work.
You're doing great.
Senior citizens are basically the only people who vote in local elections, so if you want to win, you gotta get the gray vote.
And to get the gray vote, you need to get the endorsement of Ned Jones.
He's the president of Pawnee Seniors United.
He's like The Godfather but old.
He's like The Grandfather.
The Grand Godfather.
The "grond" father, he's like-- It doesn't matter.
He's important, and he's old.
Mr. Jones, such a pleasure to meet you.
Please don't get up.
Don't worry.
I can't.
- Oh.
- Just joking.
I can get up.
But it's difficult.
But I can do it, but it is hard.
Look, I don't have a lot of time.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
Is it cancer?
No, I don't have a lot of time before my swim aerobics.
Oh.
Why are you better for seniors than Bobby Newport?
Three words: Ramp Up Pawnee.
Pawnee is way behind the times in terms of making its buildings wheelchair accessible.
Not enough ramps is the number three complaint among Pawnee seniors Right behind "everything hurts" and "I'm dying".
You wanted to see me.
Good God.
What the hell are you doing?
Upside-down sit-ups.
Great exercise, and it literally lets me see the world from a different perspective.
Isn't there a men's gymnasium where you could do that?
The world's my gymnasium, Ron.
But I will stop if it makes you uncomfortable.
Could you hold me while I dismount?
- Thanks so much.
- You bet.
Question for you.
In a town of this size, the Parks department traditionally has ten employees.
You have only seven.
Why is that?
I work hard to make sure my department is as small and ineffective as possible.
The department is so small because Leslie Knope single-handedly does the work of four people.
And she's already scaled back her time.
If she wins, she'll be dividing her time between Parks and City Council.
I'm going to have to hire a deputy director to pick up the slack.
No!
Chris, that's unnecessary.
The department is doing fine without Leslie.
Then prove it.
Complete one major project.
Either we complete a government project which is abhorrent to me, or we bring a new person into the department, which repulses me to my core.
Reminds me of when my dad made me choose which of my pet calves to slaughter with my own hands for my sixth birthday.
I couldn't choose, so I slaughtered both of them.
And they were delicious.
Essentially, we're going to put a ramp on every building in town.
Like I always say, stairs are a young man's game.
Damn straight.
This is very impressive.
You know, you remind me of my brother.
You have the same name, Leslie.
He lost a third of his body in a motorcycle accident.
The middle third.
But they sutured the hell out of him.
He's-- he's fine now.
Much shorter, but a good-looking, young, flat man.
What have you heard about Newport's new campaign manager, Jennifer Barkley?
Uh, who?
She wants to have a meeting with me at 5:00.
I told her sorry.
I don't talk politics after dinner.
Oh my God Newport hired a real Washington hotshot.
Wow, she worked with James Carville?
She ran two Republican congressional campaigns and a Senate race.
Yeah, and check out this picture.
She's eating egg salad with Colin Powell.
That's the most impressive thing I've ever seen.
Why are you smiling?
Why is this terrifying information making you smile?
Newport's scared.
I mean, he must've shelled out a fortune to hire her.
- So what do we do next?
- I'm going to set up a meeting.
I mean, we can size her up, but more importantly, it'll humanize you and make it harder for her to attack you.
And we'll do it at JJ's Diner.
Home field advantage.
As a candidate, I appreciate your strategic mind, but as woman, all I care about is your slight but powerful body.
Hello, Ann Perkins.
This is the first time you've said my entire name correctly.
Nonsense.
We are close friends.
I have good news for you.
I'm making the water fountain hygiene upgrade our number one priority.
Oh, great.
For some reason, when people in Pawnee use the water fountain, they put their mouths completely over the spouts.
It's like this weird, disgusting, local quirk.
Kiss one water-fountain drinker, you're kissing everyone in Pawnee.
Including him.
I'd like to complete this project by tomorrow.
Oh.
Set up shop in our office.
In fact, take Leslie's desk.
Okay, I will.
Thanks.
Great.
Do you want the door open or shut?
Ah, open's fine.
Okay.
Hello, Marta.
We would like our regular table, but we want you to set it up a little fancier than normal because we're trying to impress someone.
You mean Ms. Barkley.
She's already here.
Last booth.
Leslie Knope.
Hi.
I'm Jen Barkley.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Grab a seat.
Thanks.
Sorry about all these papers.
I had them shipped in.
I'm a news junkie.
Is this in Arabic?
Well, I've been reading up on you two.
Ben, it's a great job on this campaign.
Oh.
Well, thank you.
And Leslie, your Parks work, it's no joke.
This is federal government caliber.
Not to sound rude, but what are you doing here?
This campaign seems beneath you.
Yeah.
Bobby Newport's daddy called me out of the blue.
I'd never heard of Bobby Newport before, but it became clear in two seconds this guy is a moron.
So I was, like, "sorry, Nick.
Your son is a moron.
There's no way".
Then he offered me a crazy amount of money.
I shouldn't even tell you how much.
But I will.
$250,000.
Good lord.
For six weeks of work?
I know.
Plus frankly, I needed a break from Washington.
Do you know Joe Biden?
Oh, mm-hmm.
He's on my celebrity sex list.
Well, he is my celebrity sex list.
Oh, trust me.
You can do better than Joe.
Oh, no.
I don't-- I don't think I can.
No way.
Oh, man.
I knew I shouldn't have met you guys.
Now I kind of hope you win.
She's just doing this for the money.
She doesn't even like her own client.
This could be the best case scenario for us.
Or the real best case scenario is if she just takes the money and doesn't even try.
Tell me a little bit about Leslie Knope.
Well, Perd, Leslie Knope represents everything that is wrong about politics in America.
She's naive, she's untested, and she's an entrenched bureaucrat that's got the stink of big government all over her.
- Oh, God.
- What?
Wow, strong words from a powerful lady.
So I guess we both agree.
Leslie Knope is wrong for Pawnee.
Worst case scenario.
Worst case scenario!
I'm Leslie Knope and when I grow up, I want to be a unicorn princess or a city councilor.
Wrong.
Not in my town, kid.
City council's a real job for a real adult.
It's playing every hour on every channel.
It's official.
I hate Jennifer Barkley.
When I go to that senior center, I'm going to go up onstage, and I'm going to viciously attack her.
Okay, don't let Barkley knock us off message.
We are going there to get Ned Jones' endorsement, - and that's huge.
- You're right.
And I should listen to you always because you are a man genius with a taut, narrow frame like a sexy, elf king.
Do you wish I were taller or-- what's going on?
Nothing.
You're perfect.
Okay, everyone.
So the Health department is working on a poster campaign to warn people about diseases.
Now we are going to build a better water fountain for the parks.
Andy is our official water-fountain tester.
All right, let's give this sucker a test-drive.
Yeah, so the idea is to make a fountain that he can't do that to.
Ah, that's good.
Okay, any ideas?
Jerry?
Well, I was thinking that we could put this cage thing around it.
Okay.
That could work.
Andy?
Yeah.
Thank you, Andy.
Ah, still good.
- Tom?
- Full disclosure.
Ann and I are romantically intertwined.
Oh, God.
So let's not be surprised if she picks my idea.
Would you just go, dummy?
What's the best kind of water fountain?
How about no water fountain?
This is the Voss Water Butler by Tumi.
And only $600 a bag.
April, what's your idea?
To go in that room and finish this book.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- Is it good?
- Yeah.
You're going to stay here, and you're going to help.
Donna?
Do I look like I drink water?
Yoo-hoo.
I'm over here.
Just about to start my presentation.
I-- uh-oh, stairs.
What do I do?
How do I get from here to there?
I'm not a professional mountain climber.
It's a real problem in our town, but not any more, thanks to Ramp Up Pawnee.
We're going to put ramps in every building in this town because if there's one thing I believe, it's that stairs are a young man's game.
Yeah.
Ramps are an idiot's game.
This is nothing more than a worse version of Bobby Newport's plan.
What plan?
Bobby Newport doesn't have a plan.
Was somebody just talking about Bobby Newport's plan?
Because Ned Jones and I would love to share it with you.
Come on out here, Ned.
Ned Jones is here.
Say hello to Ned Jones.
Make way for Ned Jones.
Why don't we just turn up the pressure?
That way you don't have to put your mouth so close.
All right, here we go.
Ah, stop!
Honey, I'm sorry.
That'll teach you to pay attention.
I have an idea.
Um, I was thinking, "what if we did "something like this"?
Oh, my-- dude, what the hell?
Bobby Newport's plan is called "Rise Up!
Pawnee".
He is going to put an electric lift on every outdoor staircase in town.
Wow.
Now you could use a ramp, but that seems like a lot of work.
Bobby Newport thinks that the stairs should do the work for you, don't you agree?
Give him a hand.
As President of Seniors United, I endorse Bobby Newport.
I've started meeting with people to fill in for Leslie.
I have found five candidates I'd like to hire and two I'd like to be lifelong friends with.
Well, you will not be hiring anyone because my department is just finishing up a major project.
Incoming!
Got you!
Donna, don't!
Excuse me.
Help, everything I'm wearing is suede!
Everything I'm wearing is suede, everything I'm wearing is suede!
Excuse me, everybody.
Attention!
I think you'll agree that this department could use a little leadership.
Kamikaze!
Oh.
"Stumbling for the first time in months, "the Knope campaign seems to be rolling down "a ramp to nowhere".
We are getting our butts kicked by a guy who is not even in the country.
He's making out with some floozy in Majorca.
Sorry, I wish I was better at this.
Then you could be making out with some floozy in Majorca.
Maybe we take the fight to her?
I mean I could try to get you on Perd's show, and you could tell him how she stole your idea.
That sounds good.
Okay, I'll just do that.
I can call, or maybe I'll just go down there.
Hey.
Chris wants you in his office for the final round of interviews.
And sorry we goofed around so much.
Normally, I'd be very proud of you for what you did.
This is a rare example where wasting a full day of work is a bad thing.
Is there really going to be a weird, new person in the office?
I think so.
We may be in for a good, old-fashioned shake-up.
Jennifer Barkley.
You two-faced, carpetbagging-- Hi, Leslie.
Good to see you.
Hi, nice to see you, too.
You are a two-faced, carpet-- You want anything?
Anything?
It's on me.
Everything in this town is so cheap.
I would never accept anything from a two-faced, carpetbagging-- - Leslie.
- Please.
Let me get my insults out.
I've been practicing it the whole way over here.
I sense that you're angry.
Tell me why.
Because you stole my idea, and yours won't even work.
Ramps are more practical, and they're less expensive than lifts.
My idea is better.
Oh, I don't doubt it.
The fact is I don't care.
Ramps, lifts, your plan, my plan-- I don't actually care about any of this.
I'm just trying to win.
Look, it's not personal.
I like you.
But my job is to beat you.
So have a seat.
I'll get you some of those waffles you love.
- How do you know that-- - It's my job to know.
- God, you're good.
- I know.
Hi, guys.
What's so imporant?
Well, after yesterday's hands-on brainstorming session-- Water balloon fight.
Fair enough.
We think we came up with a fountain idea that really works.
Presenting the amazing spoutless fountain.
Huh?
What?
We just removed the splash guard because if it's not there, you can't put your mouth on it.
Well, I'll-- I'll try it.
- I did it.
- Good job, babe.
Simple, elegant, and cost-effective.
If your team keeps this up, I think we can hold off on filling the Leslie void.
I think Ben's already filling the Leslie void.
- Oh!
- Oh!
I'll give it up for that.
So what's Ben's next move for you?
Oh, oh, I'm not going to tell you that.
Oh, let me guess.
Um, you're going to attack me.
You're going to go on that perm show again, so you could tell everyone that that ramp idea was yours.
It's "Perd," first of all, and no.
Maybe.
No.
That's not a terrible idea.
No, actually, it is kind of terrible because if you go on the air and tell everybody that I stole your idea - Which you did.
- Which I did, everyone's going to think you're a sore loser, a goody-goody nerd.
Because you know what people don't care about?
They don't care about whose idea was first.
They care about whose idea was best.
Well, let's say that that was our plan, which it isn't.
Mm-hmm, okay.
What would you do instead?
Oh, Leslie.
I really shouldn't give you campaign advice.
- Right.
- Ah, what the hell.
If you love chess, which I do, but you don't have anybody to play against, which I don't, then sometimes, you just gotta play yourself.
You could attack the Newport plan for costing too much money.
No, but that would backfire because then we would just say, "you can never spend too much on seniors".
- Of course.
- You need to beat our idea.
Come up with something better.
I don't know.
Maybe a free shuttle service for seniors.
All right, that could work.
Wow.
Waffles and a cappuccino.
Gracias, Marta.
JJ's doesn't have a cappuccino maker.
Oh, it does now.
I bought them one.
Course you did.
You talked to Barkley without me?
I wanted to tell her what a jerk she was.
And then she guessed your plan immediately and demolished it.
Okay, as a rule, you shouldn't take advice from your opponent's campaign manager.
But what if she's right?
Well, what if it's a trick?
I mean, maybe she thinks our original plan would work, and she convinced you to use her plan instead because she knows that won't work.
Or maybe she thinks that we think that she thinks that, so we won't do it.
But she knows that I know that she knows that-- She's in our heads.
I'm sorry, Leslie.
She's better at this than I am.
Hey, there is no one on Earth that I would rather go into battle with than you.
- Really?
- Yes.
So tell me, what do we do, my campaign manager?
I don't know.
Okay.
I'd like to talk about your future.
Why are we on this bench?
This is weird.
You did a great job solving that problem today.
The leadership you displayed has gotten me thinking-- I didn't solve that problem.
April did.
Really?
Why did she tell me you did?
Because she's April, and she doesn't want you to think that she actually cares about something.
If you're looking for someone to help fill in for Leslie, April's a pain in the ass, but she's clearly the answer.
Perhaps you're right.
Should I go?
Oh, you're still here?
Yes.
Let's begin the show by starting it.
Now, Leslie, you claim the Newport campaign stole one of your ideas.
Well, uh They did, they stole our idea.
We were working on the Ramp Up Pawnee initiative for many weeks.
Oh, Perd.
This is politics as usual.
The fact is, Bobby Newport's plan is better for seniors, better for Pawnee.
Well, our plan is more practical, and it's cheaper.
There she goes again, Perd.
I don't know where she went the first time.
Bobby Newport cares about better, not cheaper for our seniors.
And our flash poll seems to agree.
Some 78% of those we surveyed prefer the Newport plan to the Knope plan.
This is why Ned Jones has endorsed us.
Let's get back on track.
I just think o opppposition is losing sight of what all this is about.
What this is about is Pawnee, and that is what I care about.
What Bobby Newport cares about is romping around on some beach in Spain with a floozy.
Excuse me?
Oh, maybe you hadn't heard of it.
It wasn't in the New York Times or Le Monde, which is what she reads.
It was in the Pawnee papers.
Bobby Newport's personal life is neither here nor there.
It's certainly not here.
And I think Pawneeans deserve a city councilor who stays in the city, like I do.
Well, we were going to keep this sececret until we had everything in writing, but Bobby Newport is trying to convince a major European company to open up a factory in Pawnee.
And that woman that he is with is an antiland-mine advocate.
I didn't realize that you were proland-mine.
I am not here to declare a winner, but Jennifer is the winner.
Thank you.
Now it's time to move onto our next segment, which is a commercial.
I am going to get drunk, and then I'm going to order a three-course meal where each course is made of dessert.
- She kicked our asses.
- Yeah.
How are we going to beat her?
I don't know.
I mean, she's like a hurricane.
She's everywhere.
Literally.
Hi, guys.
You really stepped up your game.
That was really fun.
You almost got me.
I would have if Bobby Newport hadn't gotten those stupid companies to build factories here.
What are you talking about?
Oh, that thing I said on the show?
Oh, no.
That was mostly made-up.
Don't challenge me on that.
That will backfire.
Anyway, enjoy your dinner, guys.
I already took care of the bill.
- Another round, please?
- Mm-hmm.
Nice job on the water fountain.
- It wasn't me.
- Don't deny it.
I know it wasn't the nurse.
I'm asking you to step up.
Not replacing Leslie, just picking up some slack.
I don't want to do things.
I want to not do things, just like you taught me.
And I taught you well, but I don't like watching you wasting your brain.
And you're too smart to stay my assistant here forever.
I'd rather you start a business or use your hands to farm, but right now, the department needs you.
Please.
Okay But only because you begged.
Good girl.
Chris Traeger.
This is Ron Swanson.
April's going to take over some of Leslie's responsibilities.
Excellent.
I have been a fan of April since day one.
I told--
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
It's my new interview outfit.
Like, "hey, nice to meet you".
Can't wait for the interview".
Um, I--maybe the h-- - maybe the hat.
- Yeah.
Lose this?
To win an election, you have to be good, and you have to be lucky.
Buddy Wood hosts the number-one morning show in Indianapolis, and he wants to interview me for a series he's doing on local elections.
And last year the five people that he profiled all won.
This is a huge break for us.
Um hey.
M-maybe we should put a pause on the fashion show.
We have to go over your talking points.
Keep going.
I can still hear you.
Um, okay, Ms. Knope, what is going to be your first major public works project?
Oh, I don't know.
But I bet these pants will work for the public.
- Whoo!
- Yeah, those pants look dope!
- Right?
- Oh, my God, those look great.
And I bet they look even better on Ben's floor.
- Oh!
- Are you hitting on Leslie for me?
Wait a second.
Just turn around.
What?
Oh.
It says "Nympho" on the butt in silver, sparkly letters.
Nympho means you're addicted to sex, and since it's on the butt, there's other implications as well.
So those are a maybe.
Who was Laura Mulvey?
Laura Mulvey was - A guy - Girl.
Right.
Women's studies.
They're all girls.
Laura Mulvey was a feminist film critic who Wrote a major essay that helped shift the orientation of film theory to the psychoanalytical framework!
Treat, please.
I'm about to take my first-ever final for my women's studies class.
Treat!
Usually, tests scare me, but this is an oral exam.
Uh, and if there's one thing I know is-- My fantastic-- it's talk.
God, I don't know.
Man, I'm so nervous.
I know--I'm just gonna call the Professor, and then I'm gonna get on the phone and make some fake barfing sounds, and then I'm just gonna bail, so give me my phone.
No!
Andrew That's now how grown-ups handle tough situations.
- Well, I-- - We face our fears head-on.
Told you--if you can't remember what some woman did, just tear up and say, "she changed my life".
Ah, that's a good call.
I think this is it.
But do I need a hat, like a bowler, or an edgy scarf?
No, those endless scarves that come out of your sleeves like a magician.
UmI think you should just go with something basic-- No nonsense.
Mr. Wood, hello.
God, he is more tightly wound than ever.
Maybe we should see if he can pull that rod out of his butt and we can hang some of those outfits on it.
Ann and I have the occasional rough patch in our relationship.
But right now, we're really in a groove.
We've gone 30 hours without breaking up.
Our personal best is 47 hours.
It happened when she was out of town for two days and she forgot we were dating.
Well, let me know if anything changes.
Thank you.
- Interview's off.
- What?
Buddy has to fly back to Indianapolis early-- something about a factory explosion.
Come on, did anyone even get hurt?
Sorry.
First stroke of luck we've had, and it's gone.
Okay, well, we just have to work harder.
I mean, good news is, we can call it a night and get a super-early start on our door-to-door tomorrow.
Ooh, that is great news.
And, you know, we might even be able to make it back in time for boring club.
Do you know who the president or boring club is?
Me?
Nope You lost the election 'cause your speech was too boring.
Hey, why don't we all go get a drink, blow off some steam?
Everybody's been working so hard.
UmWell, we're in the homestretch here, and losing that interview didn't help.
I'm gonna go over some polling numbers and turn in early.
I suggest you do the same.
Hey, Leslie, give you a ride home?
Ah, screw it.
I got a new outfit.
My hair looks amazing.
And I have a serious excess of pre-interview adrenaline.
Who's gonna drink with me?
- Ooh - Oh Susan Bronwell, or B., Anthony-- was born in Adams, Massachusetts, in 1820, and she played a pivotal role - in the institution of women's suffrage.
- Andy - Treat, please.
- Andy, slow down.
You're taking this class pass/fail.
So I'm just looking for a freewheeling discussion about, you know, what you got from the class.
Oh.
Okay.
I would say what I find very cool about Susan B. Anthony is How She was born in Adams, Massachusetts, in 1820.
You know?
Just one man's opinion.
I passed!
I got a "P"!
- Congrats, babe.
- Yeah!
Mmm!
I was hoping for a P-plus, but that does not exist.
- Right?
- Right.
Yes, so, basically, best grade in the class-- tied for the best grade in the class.
Ron, I am a college graduate now.
- No, you're not.
- I'm a college course Graduate, and it's all because of you.
It's my pleasure, son.
I'm really proud of you.
How about a steak?
- Yeah!
- You guys have a good time.
Oh, Professor, why don't you come with us?
- Is that cool?
- Sure.
We'll let you pay for your own food, because of equality.
I guess now that the class is over, there's nothing wrong with it.
Are you gonna wear that?
Okay, I'm calling it.
I have a date with my bathtub, a glass of red wine, and a gigantic fireman named Marcus.
I'm gonna keep plugging away for a bit.
You don't mind this work, do you?
Uh-uh.
I like it.
It makes sense to me.
Mmm.
This was such a good idea.
Should we get another round?
Um I think we should get a more basic, no-nonsense beverage.
Uh maybe we should all just drink sensible portions of milk.
I mean, I love him.
It's just This campaign has turned fun, dorky Ben - into grumpy, stress-ball Ben.
- Mm.
It's like dealing with a strict mother who I am confusingly attracted to.
- Mm.
- Ben is like a MILF.
You just need to blow off some steam.
- He should just get that.
- Yeah.
- You're Leslie Knope!
- Right!
No one takes this more seriously than you do!
- Tell me about it!
- Yes!
- Tequila shots?
- Ohh!
To Knope 2012.
Mm.
Ahh.
Ding-dong.
Oh.
Hello.
Lady Knope.
I mean Leslie Knope.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Ben.
Where are you?
I'm in, uh, the house watching TV right now.
I'm watching, um Murder She Wrote.
Murder She Wrote.
I'm watching Murder She Wrote.
Amazing news-- Buddy Wood's flight was delayed.
So, if we can get to the airport right now, the interview's back on.
What?
Wow!
Whay could be wrong with that?
Nothing.
Anyway, here comes me - To the airport.
- Great.
I'll see you there as soon as possible.
Okay, bye.
The interview is back on!
- Whoo!
Yes!
- I know!
We are so "drucky".
I mean "lunky".
Ok, both the cabs in this town are busy.
But I still had eight hours rental time on that hot-tub limousine that I got for your campaign event, - and it's on its way.
- That's smart.
You're smart.
Diddly diddly diddly diddly swag.
- You did it right!
- I did it right.
- Ah!
- Ha ha!
Okay, look, this interview is a big deal, you guys.
This is a game changer, okay?
I have to do well.
Listen, let's do practice interview Big idea, Ann.
- And see how you do.
- Let's go.
Leslie, in your humble opinion What?
- Why are you from Russia?
- I don't know.
Hey, Ron is the guy I wrote about for that paper on positive male role models.
Oh, yeah, that was one of your most readable papers.
According to Andy, you're quite the feminist.
I don't consider myself an anything-ist, but my life has been shaped by powerful women.
My father once told my mother that woman was made from the rib of Adam, and my mom broke his jaw.
My Uncle Lon once tried to Is that Chris?
You know, it really looks like him.
But there's no way to know for sure.
We should ask him tomorrow.
Hey.
April Ludgate.
Why are you here eating alone?
I'm not.
I'm surrounded by friends Friends I don't know yet.
And I'm engrossed in this book.
It's the true story of a woman born with no arms and no legs who attempted to swim the English Channel.
- That's impossible.
- Oh, she drowned immediately.
It's kind of a sad story.
Cool.
I'm over there with people you actually know If you want to come join us.
Thank you.
Bye, friend.
Bye.
I'm sorry, Marcus, I'm gonna have to cancel our bath.
Something interesting is happening.
I want to watch it.
I don't know, Marcus.
I'll hit you up when I hit you up.
Wow, I feel totally normal.
I'm ready to do this.
Thank you for accommodating us on such short notice.
Hey, for Leslie Knope, anytime.
Just let me know if you need anything else, all right?
Thanks, Paul.
Hey, you got those new I.D. Badges.
They finally upgraded us-- - security swipe and everything.
- Wow, look at that.
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
Hey, thanks again for fighting for them.
"Helpy" to hop out.
Leslie Knope.
Buddy Wood.
- Buddy Wood.
- Glad you could make it.
Glad you could make it.
Thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the greatest city in the world.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're being serious.
We're setting up over there, found a small piece of carpet without a horrifying smellscape.
I'll be right there.
Hey, do I seem normal to you?
Like, does everything seem fine?
- Yeah, yeah--you seem fine.
- I seem okay?
- Uh-huh.
- I don't seem distracted or babbly or anything?
No, it's great.
So you're gonna do great.
- You're gonna do smart.
- What's that?
- Look who I found.
- Hi.
Professor Linda, this is Chris.
Chris, this is Professor Linda?
It is a genuine pleasure to meet you.
- Oh, you as well.
- Hi, there.
Would you like to hear our specials?
No need.
Porterhouse, rare, quickly.
Same.
I'll have the, uh, spinach salad.
What kind of dressings do you have?
Oh!
Linda, in case you're interested, I brought my own dressing.
You really can't be doing that.
Well, this is the last time.
I promise.
It contains extra-virgin olive oil, a little bit of lemon, and hint of turmeric.
Sounds great.
Pawnee, Indiana, home to the Sweetums Candy Corporation, and not much else.
This sleepy mini-Metropolis is the site of a fascinating city council race.
Joining us today is one of the candidates, Leslie Knope.
Leslie, welcome to Good Morning.
It's my pleasure.
Thank you for being on my show.
Leslie, we're here at the Pawnee municipal airport, which I must add is rather decrepit.
Well, I'm glad you mentioned it.
It is in desperate need of refurbishments.
And that is why I'm going to make it a centerpiece - of my platform.
- Okay.
Take, uh Joe Appledemas over there.
Joe, say hi.
Hello.
Joe has been working here since 1996, and his salary has not been raised a nickel.
I am gonna work very hard to change-- Okay, this airport seems to me like a metaphor.
Are you familiar with the term?
Pawnee's airport is symbolic of the town-- out of touch, out of date, perhaps, lost, insignificant, and sad.
Your thoughts?
Well, granted, we don't have big-city amenities, but I think we more than make up for it with friendly faces and hand-working hards-- hardworking hands.
If you say so.
I say it's sad.
Moving on Oh, my God.
If they got together, they would make the most beautiful super baby.
It would rule us all.
But what if super baby became too powerful?
I guess we'll just have to take that chance.
Chris got dumped by Jerry's daughter.
He needs this.
Plus, if they get married, he'll spend all his time with her, and I might never have to talk to him again.
Hmm.
Professor Linda, you have Really nice arms.
- Oh?
- Do you work out?
I was gonna say the exact same thing.
But I didn't want you to think that I was objectifying you with my male gaze.
May I see?
Oh, sure.
Oh, my good gracious.
You have - extraordinary caput laterale.
- Thank you.
There's nothing more important than physical health.
- I agree.
- Kendra?
- Yes?
- You know what?
I am gonna have that third steak after all.
Go ahead and put that order in now, please, and thank you.
Your campaign hit a snag of sorts, with the revelation that you and your boss, Ben Wyatt, were having une affaire de coeur-- affair of the heart.
Well, I've discussed that many times, and there's really nothing more to say.
I would rather talk about the ways to solve problems in this town.
Good luck with that.
But getting back to your affair with Ben Wyatt, who's now your campaign manager Buddy, frankly, I don't want to discuss that.
But if you'd like, we can talk about ways that I can improve the airport or our many wonderful parks.
I don't.
I'd like to talk about you and Ben Wyatt.
Uh-oh.
I know that look.
- She's got the crazy eyes.
- Yeah.
Well, like I said, I don't want to discuss it, Buddy, and, frankly, I don't appreciate your condescending tone.
But you know what?
I've had a couple drinks, so what the hell?
Ben and I first I'm sorry, Ms. Knope, are you inebriated?
What?
No.
Preposterous.
-Are you ine-- --Ebriated?
That was bad timing.
This is a Buddy Wood first-- an exclusive interview with potential city councilwoman Leslie Knope, who appears to be drunk right now on camera.
I am not drunk.
Yes, when you have a jumbo Margarita and some flaming Tequila shots, you can get drunk.
Is it this sad, pathetic town that makes you drink this way?
- This interview is over.
- Okay, Ms. Knope.
Oh-- This-- this is not because I'm drunk.
This is because of the wire.
A fitting end to a bizarre interview and a sad moment in a depressing city with no hope, in the waning moments of the bitter saga that has been a contentious campaign.
C'mon Buddy, you cannot air that tape.
Are you kidding?
This is as great for me as it is terrible for you.
The sheep that watch my show are gonna eat this up like tiramisu.
Tiramisu is an Italian dessert often-- I know what tiramisu is, okay?
- And sheep don't eat it.
- Sorry, but Tomorrow morning this gets broadcast around the entire Indiana-sphere.
Thank you for celebrating the most ultimate triumph of my life.
I'm very proud of me, and you are too.
And, Professor, I'm taking your class again next semester.
And I'm gonna lock down that P-plus.
It's impossible.
You and the women taught me that nothing is impossible.
Alright, I better be going.
- I have to get up early.
- Good-bye.
I'm teaching a morning Zumba class for retirees.
Before I do, Linda, do you enjoy land kayaking?
It's quite fun.
Well, it's more grueling than fun.
But I would love to take you.
I'm really flattered, but I just got out of a relationship, and I think I need a little more time before I jump into anything.
Of course.
I understand.
- I'm sorry.
- I appreciate your caution.
- Thank you.
- I hope to see you again.
Good-bye, everyone.
Anybody want to go to JJ's for some after-dinner omelets?
Or how about you and I go back to my place?
Yes.
Wow!
Ben, I am so sorry.
Let's just focus on the problem.
Now, if we don't stop that interview from airing in the morning, this campaign is dead.
So We have to go to Indianapolis.
- And do what?
- I don't know, Tom.
I guess we'll just set fire to the studio or something.
Ah, that's so sweet-- I've never had a boyfriend threaten to commit arson for me before.
Ah, it gets old.
We still have six hours of rental time on the hot-tub limo.
We could take that.
No one would have to drive all night.
That's actually a good idea.
Plus, it allows for the possibility of high-speed skinny-dipping.
Ugh.
Ann, I was joking.
Come on, it was a joke.
It was funny.
Where we going, folks-- drive around, hit the strip clubs?
- Yeah!
- No.
We're going to this address in Indianapolis.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You know, no one ever used this hot-tub limo for actual transportation.
And I can't take this thing on the highway, so it'll take a few extra hours.
Hey, is this a seven or a one?
Jerry.
Jerry!
Maybe you should wrap it up.
It's 4:00 in the morning.
Is it really?
Oh, my gosh.
Wow.
Well, that flew by, huh?
I will just take these down to the post office and, uh, put the, uh Oh, jeez.
Oh, no.
I put the handout flyers in the mailing envelopes, and I was supposed to put these flyers in the envelopes.
Oh My God.
Well, you know, it's like I always say.
It ain't government work if you don't have to do it twice.
Here we go!
I'll make some coffee.
Hey, you're blocking my driveway.
Leslie Knope?
- What are you doing?
- Hi, um Mr. Wood, I'm so sorry.
We--oh, my God, I can't see.
It's so bright out here.
- Ohh.
- We drove here to ask you-- No, to beg you to please destroy that tape.
Yeah, I got your 50 messages.
Leslie was just out with her friends blowing off some steam.
- What?
- Please.
Please.
Please, please, please.
That's five pleases.
As much as I enjoy the groveling, I can't destroy the tape because I don't have it, because your sad, tiny backwater airport lost my bags.
Oh, really?
You'd think a commuter airport could handle the luggage of 11 people at once, but apparently not.
Completely ruined a great story.
Thank God for that mitten factory tragedy.
- Yeah.
- Mm.
- God, that's - Okay.
- Great.
Uh - We should--yeah.
- We're gonna go.
- Good-bye.
Ah, screw it.
Yay!
Fun Ben lives.
April, Andrew Good morning to you both.
Doughnuts-- go nuts.
Hey, you kids need any money?
- No.
- Go buy yourself a Walkman.
How much is a Walkman nowadays?
Probably more than $20.
Here's $25.
Hi, guys, I just wanted to come by and thank you for a phenomenal evening.
Yeah, seems like we all had a phenomenal evening.
And I should probably thank you for introducing me to Linda.
I think we had a deep emotional connection that is very worth exploring.
So I'm gonna ask her out again When she's emotionally ready.
- Hmm.
- Hey, Ron Great red shirt.
Dude, Ronyou have to tell him what happened.
Why?
It's none of his business.
Because he's been super sad lately.
It kind of seems like you should at least give him a heads-up so he doesn't get rejected again.
I like to not get involved in these matters or any matters of any nature.
Uh, you know, Ron, someone once told me that this is not how grown-ups deal with tough situations.
We face them head-on.
Fine.
Oh, my God, Ron It was you who told me that.
That's crazy.
There's that shirt.
Look, Chris After the bar last night, I engaged in consensual activities with Linda.
- I see.
- I didn't plan it.
But it occurred.
Now you know.
Well, thank you for being forthright and telling me.
You're a good man, Ron.
I'm quite lonely.
Ah, .
They say to win an election, you have to be good, and you have to be lucky.
I got pretty damn lucky when I met Ben.
And I'm lucky that Ann and Tom and all my other friends volunteer to help me out.
And I'm super lucky that that tape disappeared.
I think we may have used up all our luck tonight.
Actually, not all of it.
He's about to get lucky.
It's--it's on.
He doesn't even know it yet.
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetheart.
I'm not sure you're even aware of this, but we have now gone 48 hours without breaking up, shattering our previous record.
That's not bad.
- To celebrate - Oh, please, don't.
Whatever this is, I don't want it.
Just a little - Condoms.
- 48 of 'em.
Different flavor for each hour.
Yeah, we're not dating any more, okay?
Get out.
- No, wait.
- Get out.
- Don't punish me.
- I took a risk.
- Yeah.
Bye.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Is the coast clear?
What are you wearing?
My sneak-around clothes.
Is he gone?
Yeah, he's gone.
Come in.
You gotta see this.
Tom and I have been seeing each other for a few weeks, and I think I'm ready to say, "I love you" To his apartment.
I love you so much.
Look at all these blankets.
One on the ottoman, one on the chair, one on the couch here, feel.
Holy hell, that's soft.
Oh, my God, is that Yep!
A whole shelf of coconut water.
I think I'm gonna cry.
This is like girl heaven.
Did he do all this just for you?
No!
He just lives like this.
He's deeply in debt, but you know what?
Who cares!
'Cause check it out.
Cheese plate and Adriatic figs.
Leslie, this is always here.
I don't know when he has time to make it.
Boutique eye cream, unisex cologne, lip exfoliator, chocolate-covered almonds, and a Sudoku book just amenities everywhere!
- I love amenities.
- I know!
Check this out.
It's the best part.
Night and day.
Look at this one.
There's another soft one.
Ohh.
Councilman Pillner, could I have a moment?
Make it quick.
In his seminal filmmaker Ken Burns describes the national park system as a America's best idea.
- Way quicker.
- Okay.
Well, but you should watch that documentary.
Now I realize that you're drafting the new city budget, and I've heard that you're planning on reducing the parks funding by 8%.
Councilman Pillner, that cannot happen.
I've gotten to know the city councilmen pretty well because of my campaign.
If you hear any of them talking about that "blonde pain in the ass," that's a-me.
Leslie, that budget is all but finalized.
I love building ships in bottles.
When the ship is done, I put a cork in it, put it on the shelf, and I move on.
Hold that cork, sir 'Cause I'm about to put an adorable face on your proposed cuts.
Meet Melody Sternway.
She's enrolled in five of our parks programs.
Our department is the only thing between her and a life of tube tops and tribal tattoos and barfing in hot tubs.
Please.
Okay, you got me.
I'll find the cuts somewhere else.
Good morning, everyone!
I'm April Ludgate and I will be filling in for Leslie while she runs for office.
So the new emergency protocol for the Parks department can be found in your binders.
What exactly is the chain of command vis-a-vis on-site response?
You know what, why don't we just say that whoever gets to the emergency first will be in charge?
Okay, so if there's an explosion, say, in Ramset Park and someone from Sewage gets there first, they'd be in charge?
I had no idea how terrible Leslie's job is.
She referred to this meeting as a nonstop thrill ride.
I'm not quite sure, but Tom can answer that if What are you doing?
Just bouncing some business ideas off Russell Simmons on Twitter.
Why?
All due respect, miss Ludgate, do you even know what you're doing here?
All due respect, Mr. hamster penis, but no, I don't.
- My last name is Guiles.
- Are you sure?
Because you look like a hamster penis.
What about a cologne that can kill spiders?
Ron Swanson, it is my pleasure to inform you that you are a finalist for the job of Assistant City Manager.
Chris, I feel I should remind you that I do not believe that the position or the entire government should exist.
That said, you'd be a fool not to pick me.
I will walk deeper into the belly of the beast if it means I'm able to further limit reckless government spending.
I mean, I have so many ideas.
Some are simple like "take down traffic lights" and "eliminate the Post Office".
The bigger ones will be tougher, like "bring all of this crumbling to the ground".
There is one more step in the vetting process.
You and I will embark on a quick session of heart rate meditation, focusing on conscious breathing and opening the heart chakra.
I'm not sure I'm interested in that.
No, I am sure.
I am not interested in that.
Ron, you and I are very different people, and we have often been at odds.
It is crucial that you and I spend a day spiritually engaged, and consider what it would really mean to work together.
Trust me, you'll love it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, wear your yoga pants.
Okay, I really wish we would've talked about this first.
What could possibly be wrong about me saving the Parks department budget?
I don't know.
That's the point.
You're thinking like a Parks department employee, not a city council candidate.
You're in a campaign literally.
Everything you do right now is politics.
Oh, really?
Is this politics?
Ow.
What is what is that?
- What why did you do that?
- I'm in a good mood.
Because the city councilor listened to me.
It means I have some juice.
Look, this might be a good thing.
But there's a reason we strategize - before we make decisions.
- Okay.
Okay.
I'll make some calls, see where we are.
- Enjoying the view.
- What is going on?
I'm just really into you.
Gimme a spin, baby.
I hate doing Leslie's job.
I'm filling in for a person who smiles 90% of the time.
Tom, can you please help me?
Please?
Or just do it?
Come on, lil sparkle.
Don't give up.
What does Leslie always say?
I don't know, weird stuff about waffles.
She says, "you get out of a job what you put into it".
You just need to find a project you're passionate about.
For instance, I was incredible at naming drinks at the Snakehole Lounge because I care a great deal about signature beverages.
The Beer-yonce Knowles.
It's just a regular beer, but we put it in a sexy-ass mug.
Pairs nicely with the Jay-zima.
We bought a bunch of zima when the factory shut down.
That sounds fun.
Maybe I should work at a bar.
Come on, there must be some aspect of this job you care about.
Hello.
Here are some papers Leslie requested.
- These are blank.
- Weird.
As long as I'm here, can I ask you a question?
Did you ever participate in meditation with Chris?
Oh, yeah.
When we dated, he made me do it every week.
- What am I in for here?
- Okay, here's the deal.
It's crazy boring, it lasts forever, you're gonna wish you were dead.
Do you wanna borrow my yoga pants?
Hey.
So did Pillner finalize the budget?
Are we okay?
- We are the opposite of okay.
- What do you mean?
To keep the money in Parks, they're gonna shut down the Westside animal shelter.
The money had to come from somewhere, and the shelter is on its last legs.
So they're closing it at the end of the week.
That's where Champion came from.
What will happen to all the other animals?
- Well, they'll be - Fine.
No.
They'll be No!
Guys.
Apparently, Leslie Knope wielded her insider influence and got Councilman Pillner to save her precious department, even though it meant closing the shelter.
Now I am not saying that Leslie Knope is a dog murderer, per se, I just think that her actions raise some questions.
Like, for example, is she a dog murderer?
God.
Well, I don't know the answer to that, Jennifer, but your tone makes me think Yes.
Say your good-byes, Pebble 'Cause "Weswie" Knope gonna kill you.
She got the perfect puppy for that shot.
She is good.
Leslie, there is a woman on the phone that says her daughter's scared to go to sleep because Leslie Knope's going to come murder her kitty.
- Okay, we can fix this.
- Yes, we can.
Tomorrow morning, we are going back to Pillner and telling him to cut the Parks budget.
No, no, no, no.
We can figure something else out.
Leslie!
Hey, honey, good morning.
How did you sleep?
I adopted 32 cats and dogs.
Do you want pancakes?
- I'm gonna make pancakes.
- Is that a pig?
- What?
Which one?
- Is that a pig?
You talking about this one?
This one right here?
Yes, that is a pig.
This is the best meditation center in the area.
It doesn't look like much.
Actually, this strip mall has surprisingly decent chi.
Although, the smells from the Greek restaurant next door are not ideal.
But through this door lies a deep, serene quietude.
Excuse me, ladies.
On your right.
After you, Ron.
Now take in the vibe of the room and remain open of mind and of spirit.
Now quietly sit behind me and let's join breath.
- I'll stand.
- Interesting technique.
Andy, look at this little guy!
He's such a little runt.
Hey, there.
Hey, Tom, look.
Oh, I just had five cats on me at once!
You wanna come in here and try to break my record?
That's okay, Andy, I think I'm gonna keep my distance.
Don't want none of that animal dander interacting with this cashmere.
What's your endgame here, my dear?
This is only temporary until I find a way to keep the shelter open without cutting the Parks budget.
Hey, what if I threw together a pet adoption in one of our parks would that be cool?
April, that would be the coolest thing since 'N Sync, Aerosmith, and Nelly performed together at the Super Bowl halftime show.
Ew.
I think I may have found a project I'd actually enjoy doing helping these cats and dogs.
They should be rewarded for not being people.
I hate people.
I'm very proud of you, April.
Meanwhile, you and I are gonna look at the town budget and we're gonna find something expendable.
Hey, Ben, the pig ate your noise-canceling headphones.
Pigs are awesome!
All told, we were in there about six hours.
And no, I was not meditating.
I just stood there, quietly breathing.
There were no thoughts in my head whatsoever.
My mind was blank.
I don't know what the hell these other crackpots are doing.
Jerry, the puppies are going to the bathroom everywhere.
We can't let people see that.
I need you to continuously clean out the cages, okay?
- You got it, boss.
- Thank you.
Donna, did you put the info sheets on all the cages?
- Last one.
- Great.
Each animal has a photo, special talents, and a personal history That I made up.
A lot of these dogs have rescued people from burning buildings.
This one helped Ray Charles around.
What?
This cat was in Boogie Nights?
- Hi.
You like this little guy?
- He's so cute.
I know.
All the animal are up-to-date on their shots.
- And I think he likes you.
- He's pretty awesome.
Did you know his great-grandfather was Spuds Mackenzie?
What do you think, sweetie?
Do you wanna take him home?
Yes, please.
Realistically, I'm guessing we dropped three to five points in the polls.
This late in the game, it's killer.
And that's a dog biscuit.
Andy put them on the table 'cause he wanted to try to have the dogs play poker.
Okay, Leslie, we are out of time.
- We have to go back to them.
- Oh, my God!
This is it.
Hmm.
Oh, for God's sake, Leslie.
There's just not enough money to do all the things you wanna do.
You're trying to fit two ships into one bottle.
Take it from me, you can't do that.
Okay, just look at this.
There are three employees designated as D1, or on retainer.
Public Works is still paying them even though they haven't worked in two years.
It's an oversight.
We get rid of them and we have just enough money to keep the animal shelter operating while still maintaining the Parks budget.
Interesting.
Looks like we found a bigger bottle.
I know you're just making a joke, but using a bigger bottle would be considered cheating by most of our major trade publications.
FYI.
Ron, you've radiated mindfulness.
What were you thinking about?
- I wasn't thinking at all.
- Incredible.
It takes a ton of work for me to get to that kind of a clear head space, no matter how hard I try.
Don't try so hard.
Don't try so hard.
Ron, I'm going to try your "not trying" method right here, right now.
Chris, wait.
I know this crap is important to you, so I should come clean.
I got nothing out of that experience at all.
So if you're looking for someone who enjoys meditation Oh, I didn't expect you to enjoy it.
My one reservation about you as a co-worker was that you seem inflexible.
And merely by agreeing to an activity you're not interested in, you showed flexibility.
Ron, you've got the job.
- You wanna head back?
- I do.
But first, there's a hot, spinning cone of meat in that Greek restaurant next door.
I don't know what it is, but I'd like to eat the whole thing.
Why is it so dead?
Where is everyone?
Don't give up yet.
There's a few minutes left.
Is this where we drop off our unwanted cats?
- No.
It's the opposite.
- Okay.
I'm just gonna put these here for a second.
And then, uh We ended up with more animals than we started with.
This is what happens when you try.
All of these animals are gonna die.
God!
I hope you're happy, stupid people in this stupid town!
Hey!
Hey, you!
Get back here and get your  cats out of there!
Do you think Barack and Michelle Obama feel like this at the end of the day?
Probably.
I mean, I don't know how else wait a second.
Is that so am I Michelle?
Hey, how is everyone?
- Great!
- Pretty good.
We saved the animal shelter and the Parks budget.
That's great news.
Let me guess.
You found room in other parts of the budget somewhere?
Totally.
Got rid of a bunch of lame-ass D1's from Public Works.
Awesome news.
Hey, you know what else is pretty neat, is thanks to you, councilman Pillner went through the budget and decided that not just Public Works but all D1's will be terminated in two weeks.
- I'm getting fired.
- Ba-what now?
Oh!
Councilman Houser I was just looking for you.
I have found my assistant city manager.
You wanna guess who it is?
It's Ron Swanson!
I'm sorry.
I should've let you guess.
I'm just so excited.
I'd put a pin in this for now.
Why?
Why pin it?
The council vote is three to two in favor of another term for you.
But one of the yes votes is retiring.
If Bobby Newport wins, he's gonna try to bring in his own guy.
Why would he do that?
He's not exactly thrilled you've been volunteering for the Knope campaign in your spare time.
Sorry, Chris.
If Newport wins You're gone.
I just need one more week.
- And then I think - Sorry, could you please Be careful?
Oh, I am always careful.
We're good.
If I could just get a little bit more time, I could figure out how to fix this.
Unfortunately, I cannot give you any more time.
With due respect Leslie, I am retiring at the end of this term, so I've been fine with you guys pushing me around on this budget thing.
But if you're ever gonna hold this job, there's something you need to understand.
City Council isn't about making everybody in town happy.
In fact, every decision you make is gonna make a lot of people very unhappy.
We play with live ammo around here.
Now I'm gonna close the book on this budget draft by the end of the business day.
So if you can find some way out of this mess by 5:00 P.M., you let me know.
- Thank you.
- That's fair.
I did it!
I got it out.
Oh, geez.
You don't take the ship out.
Here you go.
Chris!
Great news!
I found a way to reduce government spending by 85%.
Here's a hint no more departments.
Ha, that crazy and impractical plan may have to wait.
Turns out that Bobby Newport, if he beats Leslie, is going to appoint his own city manager.
So I may have offered you a job that I have no authority to offer.
- I'm so so sorry.
- Well, that is disappointing.
But don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.
Oh, I know.
I mean, in the grand scheme of things, who cares?
We're all just molecules, floating around in random patterns Devoid of meaning.
Well, I'll see you when I see you.
I'm a rolling stone.
- Peace.
- Stop.
Have a seat.
We did things your way, now we're gonna do it my way.
Prepare to experience true freedom and bliss.
Oh, maybe I should just go back to being a nurse full-time.
No, I will not let you return to a life of shaving wieners and dodging knife attacks from meth heads.
Right.
Okay, what are you gonna do?
Well, either you get fired, the Parks budget shrinks, or the animal shelter's gotta go.
Or we find money somewhere else.
Okay, Leslie, there is nowhere else.
This is a town budget, not a bottomless trust fund.
Okay?
Money doesn't just appear out of nowhere.
- Shh.
Stop talking.
- What?
Shh.
I have half an idea and I'm putting it together.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Do you wanna - Heh.
- I'm - No!
- Do you?
- Unh.
Shh.
Okay, now I have a complete idea.
Ben, I'm going to commit political suicide.
Hey, it's me.
Tommy!
- Hi!
- I'm not here.
April.
Swear on my great-great-grandmother's grave I'm not here.
I'm gonna come in for a second.
Can you just leave me alone?
Why so glum, sugar plum?
Um, I don't know.
Maybe because I worked so hard on that dumb pet adoption and I failed.
That's why it's stupid to work hard.
Let me show you something.
Because you worked hard, this little terribly-dressed girl has a puppy.
And this little puppy has a home.
If Leslie's taught me anything, it's that yes, this job is frustrating and you hit brick walls.
But the other 2%, it's stuff like this kid.
And that puppy.
What what is that photo?
That must come preloaded in there or something.
- Oh, my God.
- See you at work tomorrow?
Fine.
All right.
Bye, pups!
Bye, little piggies!
I don't usually poison my body with dark alcohol, but this whiskey is excellent!
Nectar of the gods.
Well, I should get back to my office.
As long as I have one.
Chris, I'm not one for positive thinking or visualization or meditation or really anything in the world that you believe in.
But you might consider the upside of losing your job.
For example?
You would no longer be a government parasite, sucking the lifeblood from honest, hardworking people.
Instead, you'd contribute to society like a man.
That's just one way it might be good.
I'm sure there are others.
I'm sure there are.
Uh-oh.
You look serious.
What's on the agenda?
Just one item, Jennifer.
You're going to announce that Bobby Newport will use his personal fortune to save the animal shelter.
No.
No, that's that's, um that is a great idea.
In fact, I don't know why I hadn't thought of it already.
Damn it.
Damn it!
I swear the air in this town is killing my brain cells.
Actually, the water's not good for you either.
You shouldn't drink the tap water.
Has anyone told you that yet?
In exchange, no more puppy killer ads for the rest of the campaign.
- That's all we ask.
- Okay.
Well, what's to stop me from just paying for the shelter and still running the ads?
Because I told councilman Pillner that if you don't agree to our terms, he should cut the Parks budget.
And we'll leak that it was Leslie's decision and yours seem tough and fair, what with sacrificing her old apartment.
Okay, what's in it for you?
A safe home for the animals, a job for my friend, and a full Parks budget.
I wasn't born yesterday.
You've gotta have an angle.
This is a home run for us!
We're gonna dominate the news cycle for a whole week.
Well, you can have this week.
We'll take the next one.
Oh, yeah?
What makes you so sure?
Because in a week, we have a debate.
And your guy Bobby Newport is gonna have to show up, and he's gonna have to open his mouth.
And I'm gonna kick his ass.
She'll take care of that.
See ya next week!
How's my best buddy?
Just bought this.
Cranium.
It's a board game.
Have you heard of it?
It is literally the most fun I have ever had.
What do you say, after work, you, me, whiskey, wheatgrass, Cranium?
- Ron?
- Chris?
Sorry, he's meditating.
He asked me to tell anyone who comes in that he wishes to remain undisturbed so as to better clarify his head space.
Oh, God, Ron.
I am so sorry.
I'll let you get at it.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Okay, everybody, latest poll is Newport, 40%, Leslie, 32%, with everyone else way back.
Now this debate is our best chance to close that gap.
Chris, Ann, and Tom, you guys will be talking to reporters, providing facts, general spin.
- Spin team!
- Spin team!
This is the best possible job for me.
I can literally make anything sound positive.
Your house just burned down, and you lost all your money in the stock market.
It's a chance to start over.
Fire is cleansing, and true wealth is measured by the amount of love in your life.
If I had to have anybody tell me that I had cancer, I would want it to be me.
Ron, April, and Andy, you'll be throwing a party for our biggest donors.
Ooh, I can't believe our house is going to be full of rich people named Dottie and Todd and Rick.
Is the menu all set?
Yes, I will be providing several slabs of my world-famous Swanson ribs.
And I will be providing my world-famous $100 lap dances.
- Sweet!
- No.
Okay.
The election is in two weeks.
The debate is in nine hours.
Let's get to work.
Wow.
Can't believe we're doing this here.
Seats, like, 800 people.
Well, that's what you get when your opponent's the most famous person in town.
This is a lot bigger than my high school debate auditorium.
Exact same size as the podium you use in the Parks department.
Opening statement.
I am Leslie Knope.
I love this town, and I've worked my whole life to make it great.
I believe that I've earned your vote.
Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
- You got this.
- I got this.
You could debate Newport in your sleep.
I have.
I know.
We sleep in the same bed.
It's been hell.
I finally get a chance to stand in front of everyone and talk about the town that I love.
What if the town loves Bobby more than me?
There's no way.
You're going to destroy him.
I'm going to wipe the floor with his face.
You're going to rip out his spine with your teeth and then chew it up and gargle with it.
I love it when you're needlessly disgusting.
I'm trying to clean up for the party, but I swear to God, my arms can't move that way.
Leave it messy.
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.
Life is garbage.
What happened?
Ann broke up with me.
For reals this time.
And all I did was call into this radio station and give her a sweet little shout-out.
So we're up in the club.
It's me!
We're dancing.
We're sweating.
Let's just say we got to second that night.
Kind of.
Me so horny.
This chick's name is Ann Perkins.
Look her up on the government website.
She is crazy hot.
Isn't that great?
Come here.
Aah!
I complimented you.
I guess she's just afraid of how powerful her feelings are.
Dude, that's not why she broke up with you.
You have to stop your stupid swagger and just tell her in a normal voice that you care about her.
What do you know?
You don't care about things.
Yes, I do, I care about Andy And champion.
And I want Leslie to win, and I like sleeping.
So everybody has things they care about.
If Ann is yours, you need to tell her.
Okay, Chris, hypothetical crisis.
Leslie just tried to answer a question and audibly farted then threw up.
Spin.
Leslie Knope is literally overflowing with ideas for this town.
And speaking of methane, have you heard about her plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions?
- Wow.
- Nice.
- Spin team!
- Spin team!
Ann and I make such a great team.
It's silly that we're not a team in real life.
I just heard those words come out of my mouth, and I have made a decision.
I've heard that you and Tom Haverford are no longer romantically involved.
Is that true?
Yes, we broke up.
And I honestly can't believe we ever dated.
Does defy logic.
Okay, I still have feelings for you.
Strong feelings.
Emotional, primal feelings.
And I would like to give our relationship another try.
Chris, we dated for, like, three months a year ago.
I honestly think that you've built this into something that it wasn't.
And according to your rule, we can't date because you're my boss.
Maybe not for long.
If Newport wins, the city council may replace me.
But it would open it up for us to be together.
Would you like that?
Don't answer.
Just think about it.
Come on.
Let's spin.
So you do a lot of investing?
- We like to dabble.
- Mm-hmm.
I recently invested in some shirts I got at a garage sale.
Left those at Wendy's on the way home.
So The economy.
Hello.
You are here because you gave us money.
Now we will give you ribs.
Also you will watch the debate.
If you like the debate, you'll give us more money.
That is all.
Ron Swanson.
Uh-oh.
Somebody forgot to pay the cable bill.
Am I right?
It was me.
Do it.
Fierce.
Power.
Pump it up.
Nothing gets me more amped than Sarah McLachlan.
Opening statement.
I am Leslie Knope.
I love this town.
I've worked my whole life to make it great.
I believe I've earned your vote.
Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
I have the best campaign manager in the world.
I wouldn't say that.
Jen's a killer.
You can beat Newport.
I don't know if I can beat her.
Here's what I know.
I love you, and I like you.
I love you, and I like you.
And the home of the brave Your boy looks a little lost out there.
Oh, he'll be fine.
Expectations are crazy low.
If he puts two sentences together without crying, the press is going to say he's doing surprisingly well, and if he falls to pieces, he's going to look sympathetic.
It's a win-win.
So do you have any idea how long this is going to take?
Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the event we are doing tonight, which is a city council candidate debate that we're going to start now.
I'm Perd Hapley.
And I am legendary newswoman Joan Callamezzo, newly single.
It's time for opening statements.
I am Fester Trim.
Many of you know me as the man who sells you your guns at the gun-believable Gun Emporium.
Whoo!
I want to tell you about my idea for assault rifle vending machines.
You might be thinking, "what does an adult film star know about politics"?
Well, I've produced and starred in over 400 adult films this year alone.
- Whoo!
- Thank you.
And just like Leslie, I know what it's like to be the only woman in a room full of men.
I am Manrico Della Rossa.
I believe animals are as important as people.
And if elected, I will fight for them as if they are my own children.
I am Leslie Knope.
I love this town, and I've worked my whole life to make it great.
I believe that I've earned your vote.
Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
And maybe that's because he's never earned anything his entire life.
That--that hurt my feelings.
Hurt my feelings.
You're supposed to be this positive person.
Can't we just talk about things we like?
Well said.
Uh, just a reminder to our candidates to keep it civil.
Looking at you, Leslie.
Ah, that's okay, Joan.
I'm okay.
I'm just-- I'm nervous, man.
I'm nervous.
Gah.
I guess I want to do a good job because, um, I like it when people think I do a good job.
And I want your vote because I want Pawnee and my dad to see what I'm made of.
So let's do this.
The wrecking crew.
Who let you guys in?
Hey, Jason.
Ease back.
This question about public safety comes from Twitter because apparently, that's something that happens now.
@munchmeat2015 asks, "Pawnee used 2 b safe.
"Some1 stole my car.
"What will u do "2 make Pawnee safe & can u help me find my car"?
I can assure you, if you had a gun mounted on the dashboard, which automatically shot people trying to break into it, you would still have your car.
You know, I guess I would like to tell Mr. Munchmeat that I think that stinks that happened to him.
You know, one time a guy stole some downhill skis out of my jeep.
And I was so mad, I punched a mailbox.
I'm against crime, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.
I can't get through to the cable company.
Can you do something?
- Like what?
- Anything.
Andy's just acting out scenes from his favorite movies.
So Swayze runs, boom!
Tackles the guy off the motorcycle.
Dude's like, "you're dead, bro"!
Comes at him.
Swayze ducks, scissor kick.
Sha!
The guy has Swayze's head.
And he says, "I used to  guys like you in prison".
By the looks of this guy, this is not consensual sex we're talking about.
We see bad guy had a gun the whole time.
He's like, "I'ma kill you the old-fashioned way".
Swayze's like, "not this time".
That's subtext.
He doesn't say that.
Bypasses the gun, hooks the arm.
Back to the secret move he used before to kill somebody, he feels so bad about it.
But this time he has to do it because it's self-defense.
K-k-k-kah!
Takes the esophagus out of the neck area.
You can't eat.
You'll starve to death.
And that is Road House.
What should I do next?
Leslie Knope.
This question is about Pawnee's park system.
Why is Ramsett Park so filthy and awful?
It's difficult to get into the complicated problems with Ramsett Park in such a short amount of time.
- You have 20 seconds.
- Oh, my God, okay.
I will say that the parks in Pawnee-- I do have an update on your time allotment, and that update is that your time is almost gone.
I have no more time left?
Well, you had some time when I started talking, but by the time I finished, your time was up.
Thank you very much.
- She's off her game.
- She's fine.
Mr. Newport, rebuttal.
I know this.
If something is dirty, we should clean it up.
Let's start there.
Right?
You know what, I had this cleaning lady named Yolanda who was very wise.
She basically raised me.
And one day she said, "little Bobby, I'm not going to clean your room no mas".
And from that day on, my room was gross.
Really bummed me out.
I think we should make our parks look like my room after Yolanda finally, you know, gave in and cleaned it up for me.
If I may, Joan.
That's a very sweet story, Bobby, but not all of us have Yolandas who can clean up our room for us.
Some of us believe that you need to roll up your sleeves and do the hard work yourself.
I'd just like to say that, like Leslie, I don't have people do my work for me.
Leslie and I do our work ourselves.
My work, of course, is having sex with men and women on camera.
Once again, Brandi and Leslie are essentially the same person.
But Bobby Newport is super handsome and charming, so that means people will probably vote for him because there's no justice in the world.
How do you respond to Newport's claim that the city parks need to be cleaned up?
Leslie Knope works tirelessly every day, so our parks can be the best they can be.
our parks "pristine".
And we all know the better-looking a park is, the more attention it will get from lady parks who want to have sex with it.
Excuse us.
What the hell is wrong with you?
We're fighting for our lives out there.
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the fact that we just broke up, and you're already riding the Traeger train.
What are you talking about?
I saw you guys getting back together.
What about us?
What about us, Tom?
We're not together any more because you keep acting like an ass.
I'm sorry.
I just act that way sometimes Because I'm nervous, and I feel like you're out of my league.
But I'd do anything to get back together with you.
Please.
Vote for me to be your boyfriend.
Ben, he's winning.
How is he winning?
Everything he's saying is nonsense, and he's fooling them.
Okay, you're doing fine.
I need to go back on the attack.
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
See, okay.
When you attacked, you kind of came off like a bully, and he looked sympathetic, so, you know, y-you did a really good job of easing off.
- Leslie, this is fun, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Well, there's no reason on earth that I can think of that we shouldn't have concussion grenades in our nation's movie theaters.
By the year 2013, we will have a fully functional mall on Jupiter.
Sure, I agree that movies should be more faithful to the books that they are based on, but what does that have to do with this election?
All my movies are based on books.
And anyone who even rubs their hands on a leather jacket should be tried for murder.
I'm an American.
My father is an American.
My mother is an American.
My godfather is the viceroy of the principality of Liechtenstein.
Once again, people, grenade launcher.
Daniel Craig.
No Timothy Dalton.
I was in favor of closing the borders bookstore, not the border to Mexico.
I guess my thoughts on abortion are You know, let's just all have a good time.
I don't care about that issue.
Just ask someone else.
For the record, I'd appear in a film with any of my fellow candidates.
- Anteaters.
- Kill shot.
- Money shot.
- Fudgsicles.
Let's spend our money on what matters.
Police, fire, parks, and schools.
After a rough start, your girl's doing okay.
Um, I think she's doing a little better than okay.
Or did you miss the applause she got on the raccoon safety question?
Oh, that was great.
That probably pulled her even with Bobby.
I can't believe you're so casual about this.
Don't you even want to win the debate?
Oh, we're gonna win the debate.
Got an ace in the hole.
- Little surprisey-wisey.
- What?
Oh, you'll see.
Hey, quick question.
Does that guy Chris Traeger have a girlfriend, and is his penis normal?
Stop talking.
You guys, uh, know anything about a guy named John Rambo?
Open on villagers being thrown out into a rice field.
Land mines blowing them up into pieces.
After I steal this cable feed, I will repay the cable company for the service we used.
This last question before the break is for Mr. Newport.
Uh, some--not me--have criticized your involvement with your father's candy company Sweetums.
Would your affiliation with big business affect your decisions as a city councilor?
I want to run this town like a business.
My opponent, Leslie Knope, has a very anti-business agenda.
Recently, my dad told me that if Leslie Knope wins the election, they'll probably have to move Sweetums to Mexico.
That would be terrible, of course.
Thousands of people in this town would lose their jobs, and we all wouldn't have candy.
Now, I'm not saying that is gonna happen, but I do know this.
If I win I bet I could get them to stay.
Wow.
Shocking stuff.
We're gonna be back with our closing statements right after a word from our sponsor, Sweetums, Pawnee's biggest supplier of candy and jobs.
Stick around.
So Sweetums is gonna move to Mexico if Bobby doesn't win?
How could they do that to this town?
- What a crappy stunt to pull.
- One minute back.
What do we do?
I think we attack him.
He's more confident now.
I have to attack him.
And say what?
We didn't plan for this.
- What would you even say?
- I don't know.
I'll figure out as I'm saying it.
Just let me attack him.
I want to attack him.
No, no, no, no.
It's too risky.
Just go with the closing statement we rehearsed.
Add a line at the end about how you're pro business, and we'll deal with the fallout tomorrow, okay?
What?
What's the matter with you?
I can do it.
I can crush him.
I promise.
Ah, screw it.
Go get him.
- Really?
- Kick his ass.
I am lineman for the county and the Wichita lineman Is still the line The final thing these candidates will say are their closing statements.
We will begin with our first candidate to go, Bobby Newport.
How do we fix this town?
I have no idea.
You tell me.
That's what I'm counting on.
You telling me.
And that's how it ends.
I loved it.
It's called Babe.
And I know it sounds corny.
Talking pig.
Whatever.
You should all see it.
I feel like I just did.
It's on.
And, Leslie Knope, closing statement?
I'm very angry.
I'm angry that Bobby Newport would hold this town hostage and threaten to leave if you don't give him what he wants.
It's despicable.
Corporations are not allowed to dictate what a city needs.
That power belongs to the people.
Bobby Newport and his daddy would like you to think it belongs to them.
I love this town.
And when you love something, you don't threaten it.
You don't punish it.
You fight for it.
You take care of it.
You put it first.
As your city councilor, I will make sure that no one takes advantage of Pawnee.
If I seem too passionate, it's because I care.
If I come on strong, it's because I feel strongly.
And if push too hard, it's because things aren't moving fast enough.
This is my home.
You are my family.
And I promise you I'm not going anywhere.
Holy , Leslie, that was awesome.
Thanks, Bobby.
Yeah!
Play it.
Woo-hoo!
Knope 2012!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Ron!
What the voters saw tonight is an undeniable fact.
That one of these candidates is right for this town, and one of them is not.
Thanks, guys.
Ann Perkins!
Uh-oh.
I'm sorry, Chris.
It's very flattering.
I just-- I just don't think it's a good idea.
It was worth a shot.
Well, I hope that whoever you end up with treats like you like the amazing person that you are.
Thank you.
And I am going to go run some stairs and work through these feelings.
- Is he sad?
- Oh, my God.
He looks sad.
I'm not going out with Chris again.
Does that mean we're getting back together?
No.
I don't know.
No, not right now.
There's a chance I'm never gonna date anyone ever again.
I'll take it.
And you know what else?
I'm coming for you, girl JustLikeYouWant.
Just get out there and spin, man.
You got it.
Leslie Knope is scrappy like a terrier.
She's smoooooth like a blended whiskey.
My girl has big ideas and big feelings, and she's not afraid to express 'em.
- Was I too mean?
- No, you were perfect.
- Leslie!
- Hey!
- Oh, it was amazing.
- Oh, thank you.
Hey, how was the spin room?
It was a lot.
We'll talk about it.
Woo!
We did it!
We did it!
Oh, my God, I was so nervous, but we completely go through it.
I haven't felt this good since I scored that lacrosse goal at state, seriously.
Hey, party at my dad's lake house.
Bring whoever you want.
Scrawny Christians, missionaries, come to him, and they're like, "Are you John Rambo"?
He's like, "yeah".
And they're like, "we need you to take us upriver".
And he's like, "it's a war zone up there".
And they're like, "yeah, we know.
We're gonna change things".
And he's like, "you bringing any weapons"?
They're like, "of course not".
"Then you're not changing anything.
Go home".
And then they come back in a rainstorm.
This time he says, "nope.
Go home".
They go home again.
Bottom line, they go upriver.
Does not go well.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Okay, everybody.
Big, big news.
Uh, Leslie, would you like to do the honors?
No, I think you should deliver the news.
Yeah, but you're the candidate.
Yeah, but you're the brilliant campaign manager.
- But you're the cutest.
- I love you.
I love you too.
Hey, were you going to tell us something?
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, right.
The latest poll has us only two points behind Bobby Newport!
- Whoo!
Yes!
- Two points!
I know, you guys, we only have one more day to close the gap, and we're going to do so in a one-time campaign blitz aboard the S.S. Knope.
This is going to be our home for the next 24 hours.
And if we win, hopefully, it will be the home - that Ben and I share forever.
- Uh, what?
It's just an idea I had.
We don't have to do it.
Whatever.
We can talk about it.
Okay, here we go!
We've come so far.
I want this so bad, I can taste it.
When I close my eyes, I can picture the flash of the cameras at my swearing in.
And I can hear the sound of the applause when I take my oath.
And I can see in the crowd president Obama smiling at me.
He made it.
I didn't think he would come, but he made it.
Hey, buddy.
A few days ago, on a routine campaign stop in downtown Pawnee, one Leslie Knope-- pause--was attacked-- play-- by a pie.
Luckily, it only hit Jerry, so no damage was done.
Play.
The only evidence we have is a video shot by-- pause--my wife, April Ludgate.
This is Bert Macklin's greatest assignment yet.
If you are watching, perpetrator, just know that you are still at large.
Okay, listen up, folks.
We have a security situation here.
As you know, when we reach the location, I will be conducting a security sweep.
Also, from now on, we'll be using code names.
You can address me as "eagle one".
Ann, code name: "Been there, done that".
April is "currently doing that".
Donna is "it happened once in a dream".
Chris, code name: "If I had to pick a dude".
Ben is "eagle two".
Oh, thank God.
No, please.
Come-- we have a problem.
The vans we rented to take senior citizens to the polls tomorrow are now, quote, "no longer available".
What?
I thought we locked those vans down, like, a week ago.
Yeah, we worked really hard to get those seniors back on our side after that ramp debacle.
- I really need their votes.
- Okay.
Tom, go down there and get those vans back.
I'll use my legendary Haverford charm.
I have total faith in you.
Take Donna with you.
Ron, you go too.
April, you are a very intelligent and savvy young woman.
I do not just think of you as just a gofer, but right now, I need you to get me a triple espresso with eight sugars.
Okay.
Wha-- I'm on it.
I'll go.
I'm going.
Please, I can go.
I don't mind.
It's better than listening to her stump speech for a millionth time.
No.
I will do it.
I have to do it.
I need to do it.
Good-bye.
This has been a difficult year for me, romantically.
Millicent Gergich, Ann Perkins, Andy's professor-- lots of disappointment, but if I keep my body moving and my mind occupied at all times, I will avoid falling into a bottomless pit of despair.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next city councilor of the great city of Pawnee, Leslie Knope!
This is "eagle one," "been there, done that" is leaving the stage.
"I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought about it" is in position.
What do we want for our city?
I'll tell you what I want.
I want better schools, I want cleaner streets, I want to expel the violent gangs of geese in Detweiler Square.
And I will finally eliminate this city's libraries!
Thank you.
In the last few weeks, we've turned this campaign into a well-oiled machine.
Leslie's stump speech is 10 minutes and 40 seconds every time.
Here, check this out.
There will be a big laugh right now.
And now, a two-second awkward silence after Leslie does her Rodney Dangerfield impression.
I tell ya, these geese don't give me no respect.
No respect at all.
She insists on trying it every time, and it never works.
But the rest of the speech, fantastic.
When I was building parks, helping the community, and putting together the harvest festival, where was Bobby?
He and his father, Nick Newport were exploiting this city for their personal gain.
You deserve more.
Here's the best part.
Watch what happens when she says Together, we can build a better Pawnee.
Get on your feet Everybody says they care about the issues, but at the end of the day, all anyone really wants is free clothing shot at them from a cannon.
I've been staring at this board for days.
I'm so close to putting it together.
There's got to be something we missed.
Let's go over this again.
The video shows that the pie came from a high angle, so it would've hit your face like this.
Mm-hmm.
Don't close your eyes.
Uh-- No, no.
It was actually from up higher.
Is that about right?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Clean yourself up.
Let's do this again.
Hey, Bill!
Tom Haverford from the Knope campaign.
And you brought the whole posse with you, huh?
I'm not changing my mind.
We already paid for those vans, Mr. Butler.
$900 for one day.
Yeah, it was $900, but now it's $10,000.
Excuse me?
The Newport campaign offered me 10 grand to just rent the vans and park them somewhere.
So I'm going to tear up your contract, and I'm going to take the money.
Anything else?
No?
Great.
Well, what now?
He's just playing hardball.
Let me tell you how it's gonna go down.
In a few minutes, we'll walk in there, we'll give him our demands, and then, bam!
I start crying.
We need the vans, so please, give the vans, please?
We need the vans.
And if elected, I promise to stop the Newports and Sweetums from blatantly dumping contaminants into the Pawnee river.
Leslie, can you comment on Bobby's father Nick Newport?
Nick Newport has been intimidating and bullying and poisoning this town for years.
Frankly, he's a real jerk, and if he thinks he can buy this election for his son, he's wrong.
Sorry, I meant can you comment on Nick Newport dying earlier today?
He died?
I Sad.
Is that your official statement?
"I sad"?
No, my official statement is that is overall, a bummer.
Oof.
And--and together we can build a better Pawnee.
- Get on your feet - No, this is isn't the time.
No, guys.
Get up and make it happen Frankly, he's a real jerk.
Harsh words, but this reporter does love those t-shirt cannons.
Now, Jen, what are your thoughts about all of this?
This is not a time for politics.
I am calling on Leslie Knope to cancel all of her campaign events out of respect for the Newport family.
Anything else would be a classless move, on par with spray-painting nipples on the Lincoln memorial.
Okay, emergency meeting.
I need everyone to gather around me in order of how much I trust them.
Here's the situation.
A man has died.
But that man is 98 years old, and he's an awful man.
However, he is a man, and he died.
Also, you called the dead man a jerk.
However, he was a jerk.
He put a lot of people out of work, he had tons of mistresses, he polluted this town.
Okay, Ben, what do we do?
Okay, it's unfortunate, but the stakes are too high.
We can't just stop campaigning.
We stop, we lose.
Good answer, great body.
Ann, try to beat what he said.
I'm not going to beat him.
Not with that attitude.
Okay, fine.
I think you should stop.
At least until you apologize to Bobby in person.
April?
I wasn't listening, but I strongly disagree with Ann.
Andy?
If the--if the guy--if-- Okay.
I absolutely think that we should keep campaigning.
The worst possible thing we could do would be to stop, 'cause if the campaign stops, we all stop.
And stopping is certain death.
Who wants a panini?
Anyone?
Everyone?
I'm going to say everyone.
All right.
All right, Leslie, what's your call?
Ann, there is nothing harder in the entire world than saying no to your beautiful face.
But I'm going to.
No!
We're going to keep campaigning.
Okay, but we're going to do it in a classy and respectful way to get Ann off of our backs.
What's next on the "schedge"?
If you let Newport have the vans, they just sit there in a lot.
If you let us have the vans, they drive around town all day.
Free publicity.
Everyone will see your logo.
Which is you all pressed up on some chick with huge cans.
Yeah.
It was a hell of a day.
People need to know about it.
And I don't need free publicity.
I can just pay for it.
With my $10,000.
Look, I ain't gonna try to play a player.
You're trying to get beaucoup bucks just like the rest of us.
So how about this?
I have a business idea for a gourmet alcoholic yogurt.
I call it Yogurt platinum.
I'll let you in on the ground floor.
And let me tell you, it's going to be worth way more than 10 grand.
Yeah, but now that I know your bad idea, I can start the company myself.
With my $10,000.
No, you can't do that!
Ron!
Tom, Donna, could you please give us a moment?
I'd like to talk to Bill, man to man.
He's gonna steal yogurt platinum.
No, I'm not.
"We're all your friends," said Mr. bacon.
"Welcome home".
The end.
And that is Groffle, the awful Waffle, a book that I wrote and published on behalf of my education initiative.
Any questions?
Yes?
How did Groffle cross the syrup river?
And why did you call Mr. Newport a jerk?
Ah--well, I should not have called Nick Newport a jerk, because we need to be respectful of all dead people.
I mean, not Stalin or Hitler, but-- I'm not calling Nick Newport Hitler.
Ms. Knope, I have a follow-up to what I'm now deciding to call "jerk-gate".
Are there any other deceased members of Bobby Newport's family you'd like to attack?
And quit ducking the waffle question.
Did Groffle use a boat of some kind?
All right, that's all the questions for now.
Thank you, everybody.
Are we to assume that he swam across the syrup river?
Ms. Knope!
I'm never going to get away from these Nick Newport questions.
It's obvious what you need to do.
You have to apologize to Bobby and stop campaigning.
Okay, fine.
We go to Bobby Newport, you apologize Good.
And then we leak the details to the press, which restores your reputation and buys us enough time - to finish the bus tour.
- Nice.
No, that's not a real apology.
It's just sneaky.
I don't like it.
Ann, for once, this is not about you.
A man is dead.
Look, friend, I respect your slavish devotion to the free market, but you can't welch on a contract.
Where I come from, a man's word is sacred.
Okay, what's your stance on pinky swears, George Washington?
I'm taking the money.
Fine.
I'll match it.
I'll give you $10,000 for the vans.
Deal?
No.
Price has gone up.
Now it's $12,000.
What?
Why?
Look, I own a fleet of 22 crappy white vans, and for some reason there's a massive bidding war going on over them.
Now for a guy whose only assets are 22 crappy white vans, it's pretty much a dream scenario, so I'm just going to ride this out, see where it takes me.
And now it's 15,000.
Okay, I talked Newport's people into giving us ten minutes alone with Bobby, so we get in there, we apologize, and then we get back on the campaign trail.
Okay, how do we leak this to the press?
Do we, like, release a statement?
Do we call somebody?
Um, I don't think that's going to be a problem.
Oh, my God, why are there so many people here?
It's a trap.
It's a trap!
We got to get out of here.
Turn around!
Turn around!
This is a time of solemnity and remembrance.
This is not a time for politi-- Oh, wow.
Leslie Knope is driving her campaign bus through a memorial service.
- Back it up!
- Back it up!
- Okay, back up!
- Back it up!
Just when we thought she couldn't stoop any lower.
Just--oh!
- Oh!
- Aah!
- Uh - Go forward!
Go forward!
Go forward!
I feel like he's dying all over again.
- Stop it!
- Ah!
- Oh.
- Oh, no.
Hi Sorry, are we late?
So I--I hate to bring this up again, but I just want to make sure that I'm going to get paid.
It was a handshake agreement with Mr. Newport.
It was for a lot of money.
Anyway, you can wire-transfer it.
Sorry for your loss.
I can't believe you turned this situation into a political sideshow.
Oh, come on, you guys were only going to apologize for the press.
No way, that's not us.
You don't know us at all.
It's rude to say it.
We wouldn't even think it.
Yeah, that's a ridiculous claim.
We brought a "sorry for your loss" fruit basket for Bobby.
And it is very classy.
No melon, no apples.
You were going to use us, and we just turned the tables on you.
'Cause I'm smarter and faster.
That is not a judgment.
That's just a fact.
We're both just doing whatever it takes to win, right?
I love polka dots.
It's so cute.
I'm sorry, I should have seen this coming.
And we should not have driven here on a bus with your face on it.
No, it's my fault.
And you know what?
Jen is right.
I'm no better than her.
No, Leslie, yes, you are.
All you need to do is stop the machine for a second and go apologize to Bobby.
Alone without cameras.
Thanks, Ann, but where was that advice six hours ago?
That's not going to work.
I had to try.
April.
I just got Champion his dog food, cleaned your house, filed that paperwork-- you're officially April Ludgate Dwyer, installed a smoke detector, and now I'm back.
What's next?
Nothing, Chris.
Just sit down somewhere and stop bothering me.
I can't.
I've had a very tough year.
I can't stop thinking about Ann and Millicent.
And if I'm alone with my thoughts, I go to a dark place.
Okay, first of all, dark places are awesome.
Secondly, Ann is kind of lame, so way to dodge a bullet.
And Millicent is Jerry's daughter, so two bullets.
And you're not alone.
You've got lots of friends.
Somewhere.
I assume.
You're going to be just fine.
Thank you.
You're right.
I'll be fine.
I'm not fine.
It didn't work.
Hey, Bobby.
Oh, hi.
Want to play bowling?
Why don't you play with the real one?
Oh.
I like this one better.
The little guy looks like me.
See?
Hey, can we talk for a second?
Look, I just wanted to say I'm really sorry your dad died, and I'm really, really sorry I called him a jerk.
That's okay.
He was, like, a million years old.
And he was kind of a jerk.
The only reason I did this campaign was to impress him, and he couldn't have cared less.
You know, my mom was a great athlete when she was a kid.
So in junior high, I joined the track team to impress her, even though I hated it.
And at the end of the year, I ran the 5,000 meters in this huge track event.
And I finished dead last.
And I thought that she was going to be really disappointed in me.
But she wasn't.
She ran up to me, and she wrapped me up in this big hug, and she told me she had never been more proud of me.
Thanks, Leslie.
That's a great story.
I'm not 100% sure I get the point, but-- You finished this race, Bobby.
The campaign is over, and you finished.
Win or lose, I bet you anything that your dad was proud of you.
Now I get it.
There you go.
Your mom and my dad are both dicks.
There's no vans within 50 miles, and, for some reason, no one wants to lend me $10,000.
Even if we had the dough, that bunco artist would just demand more, trust me.
Don't move.
Let's just stay here.
For like an hour, and not let him out.
This isn't right.
Our girl's worked hard.
We're so close.
I know he didn't just hit my baby!
Hey!
What the hell, guys?
Move!
All right.
Y'all got your seat belts on?
Oh!
Did you see that?
That son of a bitch just rear-ended me.
Am I dead?
What the hell?
Exactly, Bill.
What the hell?
You just rear-ended me.
That is not what happened.
- But I got witnesses.
- Yeah.
It went down exactly the way my girl said it did, you mean, bald man.
Hey, what about you, Mr. "A man's word is sacred"?
Well, it is, but you're an ass.
So we can settle this now.
I will accept payment in van rentals.
Gah!
All right, let's go to the video again.
Sweet kick, Leslie exits the building, and then you get hit.
What else do we know?
We know that Leslie was about 15 feet in front of you, so clearly the assailant has terrible aim.
Mm-hmm.
Or Leslie wasn't the target.
Well, who then?
Okay, that's permanent marker.
Go find Ben, get a list of everyone he's ever fired.
Go, go!
Macklin, you son of a bitch.
A lot of people have been asking me how I feel about everything that's happened today.
Well, let me tell you a little story.
My dad was this amazing athlete when he was a kid.
When I was in junior high, I started doing track just to impress him Even though I hated it.
At the end of the year, I entered the 5,000 meters.
And I won.
It was awesome.
My dad wrapped me in a big hug, said he was proud of me.
That's just a great story that happened between me and my dad and nobody else.
Oh, we're dead.
- It's over.
- That's my story.
Before I go, I want to bring up a special guest.
Somebody who's been very supportive and mega cool today.
Leslie Knope.
Will you come up here?
- What?
- Come on, come up here.
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Do-- You know, Leslie's been getting a lot of heat today, but I want you all to know that we talked person-to-person, and she's really great.
People should stop being so mean to her.
In fact, if you don't vote for me tomorrow, you should vote for her, because she's super, super awesome lady.
Leslie, we did it!
Yeah!
Maybe we're not dead.
Chris, right?
Hi, I'm Jen.
Hello.
You know, there are Bobby's in one, there's a dead guy in another, the rest are free.
What do you say?
Oh!
That is very flattering.
But you're the opposition campaign manager.
I--I couldn't do that to Leslie.
Oh, for God's sake, Chris.
This campaign is over.
My job is done and so is yours.
It's just sex.
I'm very good at it.
- Okay.
- Great!
Let's do it.
Haven't got all day, honey.
Sewage Joe.
Ben Wyatt fired you for sending pictures of your penis to everyone, and you've come here to "pie" him.
Little twerp has it coming.
Oh, dude, I dare you.
Please.
Give me one reason to take you down.
I would love nothing more-- Oh, .
Ben, sorry.
All right, let's go.
Oh, I did it!
Yeah.
Great job.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
I will certify the results after all the precints have reported.
A final tally within 1% would trigger an automatic recount.
In the event of an exact tie, the seat is awarded to the male candidate, and the female candidate is put in jail.
Once again, I have to object.
I don't think it would hold up in court, but it is city law.
- Any questions?
- Yes, actually.
At the 11th hour the Newports are trying to install these voting machines at several precincts around town.
Watch what happens when I vote for Bobby Newport.
Good choice.
Enjoy a voucher for a complimentary Sweetums candy bar.
Shouldn't we be rewarding our citizens for voting?
I'm never against anyone getting a candy bar, but watch what happens when you vote for me.
Are you sure?
Take a second and think it over.
Then you have to press it again.
To cancel your vote and select someone better, press the Sweetums logo.
I'm sorry.
I just don't see the problem.
Bobby Newport and I are separated by a razor-thin margin.
Could go either way.
I've only slept nine hours over the past four days, so I'm right on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
This isn't a bagel.
Party starts at 7:00 in the historic Jermaine Jackson Ballroom at the Pawnee Supersuites.
It is no longer "A Pimps n' Hoes" pajama party.
That idea was nixed by a certain uptight nerd who shall remain nameless.
By 10:00, we should know if Leslie won the election, but more importantly, tonight, Ann and I are getting back together.
Oh, right, because of the dream you had?
Last night at approximately 2:30 A.M., I woke up from a dream that felt so real that it had to be a premonition.
Me, Drake, and the T-mobile girl were playing baccarat on a private jet.
Ann Perkins walks up to me, and she says, "Tommy, tomorrow night, I'm taking you back".
Then Blue Ivy Carter high-fived me and gave me $40 million.
It was all so real.
The reason why Bobby and I are appearing together is to send the message that everyone should get out and vote no matter who they're voting for.
That's right.
Another awesome point by Leslie.
That's why I'm voting for you.
What's so funny?
They're laughing at your joke.
What joke?
I am voting for you.
You're not voting for yourself?
Leslie, you can't vote for yourself, I don't think.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Anything else?
Hey, you did an unbelievable job on this campaign, Ben.
My partners back in Washington think so too.
Well, Leslie gets the credit.
Not me.
Look.
Your opponent is legendarily stupid and I phoned it in pretty hard, but you have a knack for this.
I'm running congressman Murray's reelection bid.
Ohio, 19.
I need someone to coordinate out of D.C. You want to do it?
Yeah, that sounds great, but the Pacers called, and they're asking me to be their starting point guard.
I'm being serious, Ben.
What?
What, you trust me with a congressional campaign?
Is this a trick?
No.
This is a job offer.
Give me your answer soon.
I need you in Washington in two days.
Look at that thing.
What is that?
Don't touch it.
Ann Perkins.
Can I ask your advice on something?
Sure.
Recently in a moment of weakness, I had sex with Bobby Newport's campaign manager Jennifer Barkley.
Seriously?
Yes.
Several times.
And then several more times.
And then a couple more times.
And then one more time.
How has this been going on?
Oh, it was just last night.
Now, I know it's a one-night stand and that she's leaving town, but our ferocious sexual decathlon did radically improve my mood.
And I kind of like to see her again before she leaves.
Good idea?
Bad idea?
I don't know.
I guess the campaign's over, so I suppose it couldn't hurt.
Ann Perkins.
April!
Got your message.
Where are you?
Under the table.
Why are you hiding?
Should I hide too?
What's going on?
I was supposed to copy all the department files onto a thumb drive, and it kept freezing, and I got annoyed, and I don't know what happened, but all the files are gone on every computer.
They're all gone.
Babe, they're all gone.
Okay, okay.
Calm down.
First of all, you did the right thing by hiding under this table.
Secondly, your man is here.
I'm gonna take care of this for us.
I've been playing Xbox for years.
I'm really good at fixing it when it freezes.
I know exactly what to do.
Try it now.
I don't know.
I feel like I'm forgetting something.
What about my speeches?
Finished both of them last night.
One if you win, one if you lose.
What if I tie?
You need to write a tie-speech for me, something about the poetic nature of democracy and how I'm going fight this thing from my prison cell-- Leslie, relax.
We're done.
All that's left is the waiting.
Okay?
What were you talking to Jen about?
Oh, nothing.
No, I just-- yeah, nothing.
She-- she's-- nothing.
Nothing.
It's nothing.
Hey, what's a good place to buy jeans?
You have plenty of jeans.
What were you talking about?
Jen offered me a job working on a congressional campaign Oh, my God, that's amazing.
In Washington.
What?
Are you happy or angry?
I don't know.
I don't know.
What did you say?
Did you say, "yes"?
I haven't had a chance to think about it.
I mean, it sounds amazing, but you know, six months in Washington, D.C. Away from you, but you know, we should talk about it.
Yeah.
We'll just talk about it.
You know, we'll mull it over, we'll look at it from every side.
Et cetera, et cetera.
Just-- I'm going to go vote, just fulfill a lifelong dream of mine and achieve one of my all-time happiest moments real quick, and then we will talk about it.
Cool.
Leslie, I can't figure this thing out.
Can you help me?
Yeah, just hang on a second, Bobby.
Ink all over my hands, and the pen thing-y came off the chain.
I don't get it!
The polls have just closed, and now we're getting results in the race for city council.
With just 1% of the precincts reporting, adult film star Brandi Maxxxx has a commanding lead.
Oh, my God.
That's it.
It's not Bobby Newport who's going to beat me, it's Brandi Maxxxx, the porn star.
What is this?
Italy?
Listen, I know you're stressed out, and I figured you would be, so I took the liberty of arranging a fun little activity for us.
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, Ann.
Thank you so much.
I've said this to you before, and I know it makes you uncomfortable Oh, boy.
But you're thoughtful, and you're brilliant, and your ambiguous ethnic blend perfectly represents the dream of the American melting pot.
Okay, let's go.
Another, Dana, please and thank you.
Ron, I handed out That is a personal best.
Now I'm off to vote.
The polls are closed.
What?
No, no, no.
I thought that they close at 8:00.
Oh, my God.
Ron, I didn't get to vote for Leslie.
Oh, my God, what do I do?
Nothing you can do.
Except hope Leslie doesn't lose by one vote.
and it's razor-thin and getting razor-thinner.
Oh, boy.
No.
No.
Jen Barkley.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
That was fun last night, you old screamer.
There were moments that I didn't fully understand some of the physical shapes that we were making Mm.
But the sensations were amazing.
- So I just went with it.
- Great.
Well, I thought that we could just talk before you left town if that's okay.
No, but there's a supply room over there with a futon.
Great.
Not yet.
Just wait-- we're just getting supplies.
Anybody need anything?
Pushpins-- okay, good.
Please hurry.
I told her it's a matter of life and death.
Honey, Donna's been here forever.
She's going to know what to do.
What if she doesn't?
I could get fired.
Or even worse, Leslie might give me a lecture on responsibility again, I can't do it.
I'll tell you what, honey.
Here's the deal.
You get fired, I'll quit.
We'll leave together.
I'm serious.
Move to a new city.
Change our names, burn our fingertips off with acid, swap faces.
- What?
- If we have to.
Good.
Yes.
Nice.
Keep punching.
- Did I hit your boob?
- No.
Sorry.
Great form.
Maybe.
I have no idea actually.
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Yeah!
That was good.
I'm exhausted.
How long was that?
Boy, that's disappointing.
What are you going to do about Ben?
I just-- I've been running for office the entire time we've been dating.
We're just about to get our lives back.
It would kill me if he left.
Then tell him that.
Go find him and tell him how you feel.
And then the two of you could work it out together.
Election results, Ann.
Ann, Ann, I can't read it.
- Okay.
- Ann, my hands.
My hands, Ann.
- Here.
- They're in these round gloves.
Here.
Okay.
Bobby Newport is up by 140 votes.
Okay.
Let's get your hands back up.
- Okay.
- Go another eight seconds.
Oh, God, I'm so tired.
Gin and tonic, please.
Belay that order, Dana.
Lagavulin, neat.
Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets.
What's on your mind, son?
Well, Jen Barkley offered me a job in Washington.
A great job, but I think Leslie wants me to stay.
What would you do?
Well, I've never been one for meeting new people or doing new things or eating new types of food or traveling outside of southern Indiana.
I've had the same haircut since 1978, and I've driven the same car since 1991.
I've used the same wooden comb for three decades.
I have one bowl.
I still get my milk delivered by horse.
You do?
But you and Leslie like to hold hands and jump off of cliffs together into the great unknown.
You two have a good relationship.
I don't personally know what that's like, but I'm given to understand that means you're going to land on your feet.
So you really want things to just stay exactly the same?
But if Leslie wins, you get my old job, assistant city manager, right?
Seems that way.
Then good luck to the both of us.
Hey--uh!
Hmm!
I have an update that contains new information.
With 74% of the precincts reporting, Leslie Knope is now winning by 192 votes.
Oh, thank God.
Oh, lord, please, please.
Let her win.
Please, lord.
Please, lord, let her win.
Please let her win.
I'm just going to say this.
And I realize this after speaking with my best friend and relationship advisor Ann Perkins from the department of health.
Yes, I know Ann.
I don't want you to go to Washington.
I know it's an amazing opportunity, but in just a few minutes, all this craziness is going to be over, and I just want to have dinner with you.
Like normal people.
Yeah, then I won't go.
Really?
Yeah.
Easy.
I mean, I was on the fence about it anyway.
Washington's really far away, and I don't know if I want to work with Jen.
I mean, this just seals the deal.
I'll stay.
Oh, thank God.
What a relief.
Guys.
It's been neck-in-neck, too close to call all night, but now we're ready to make a call in the race for city council.
Bobby Newport Oh, no.
Scion of the Sweetums candy empire and amateur go-kart champion has won the race.
Why are you laughing?
Because my dream is dead.
Oh, oh.
Oh, .
Recount!
There's a recount.
Oh, come on.
It's over.
Just concede.
Newport won by 21 votes.
That's well within the margin for a recount.
Please don't do this.
I really want to get out of here.
How about this-- why don't I make you guys a deal?
Okay, there's no deal in the world that we would ever possibly-- I'll give you Joe Biden's home phone number.
Now, hang on.
That's interesting.
No, no, you're not thinking clearly.
Mr. Commissioner, the recount has to start immediately.
It's the law.
Now I'm not leaving until you make the call.
He's right, Ms. Barkley.
It'll start right away.
- Keep your phones on.
- Terrence!
I just want to go home.
Hey, any news?
They said the recount could take two hours, but who knows.
Man, this is stressful.
I picked the wrong week to do a juice cleanse.
Okay, I think Leslie should say something to the troops just to get everyone's spirits up.
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
She's not answering her phone.
What?
No one knows where she is?
That's a nice chair.
Corinthian leather, solid mahogany frame with what I believe are hand-cut mortise and tenon joints pinned with oak.
I was really looking forward to sitting in it.
Figured this might be my last chance.
You don't know that.
Ron, for the last six months, my friends have worked so hard.
Every five-minute coffee break at work, every night, every weekend, every spare moment of their lives, they gave to me.
If I lose, I'll never forgive myself.
You deserve to win.
We didn't volunteer to help you because we wanted to wrap ourselves in personal glory.
We did it because wecare about you.
You had a dream, and we wanted to support your dream.
That's what you do when you care about someone.
You support them, win, lose, or draw.
Let's go back to the party.
You drive.
I've had 11 whiskeys.
Okay.
That's good on places to live.
Let's go back to dream jobs.
If we had to start a new life, I have Detective, FBI agent, policeman, CIA agent.
So we need more for you.
Let's go.
- Andy, I-- - It's fun.
I'm trying to help you take your mind off of this horrible mistake you made deleting all these files, probably the worst thing to ever happen in Parks and Rec history.
You will certainly get fired, and I'm trying to help.
God.
So dream jobs, go.
Dream big, kid!
Fine.
Uh, dental hygienist who's also a medium, so I can clean people's teeth and tell them when they're going to die.
That's brilliant.
Let's make this fast.
I almost made it with Councilman Howser before you interrupted us.
Which files did you delete?
All of them.
I just put the stupid flash drive in, and then I tried to drag everything over, and-- Fixed it.
- What?
- What?
How?
Jerry accidentally deletes things all the time.
Ten years ago, I installed my own secret backup.
- You saved us, Donna.
- Oh.
- I love you.
- Oh.
Okay.
Bring it in, boy.
There you are.
Thank God.
We're going to get the final results any minute.
I know.
Do you have both my speeches?
Yes.
You seem calmer than I expected you'd be.
I got you something.
Let me open it for you.
You have to go to Washington.
I told you I'm turning it down.
I was being selfish.
You put your whole life on hold for me.
The very least I can do is try to return the favor.
Are you sure about this?
We can make it work.
I will visit you, then you come visit me.
And then I go visit you again.
And then we make out in the Lincoln bedroom And the Jefferson Memorial and the Supreme Court gallery.
We'll do it all over Washington.
Thank you.
Where did you get a Washington Monument figurine at midnight on a Tuesday?
From my office.
I have, like, 50 of them.
Right.
The recount's over.
They just called the race.
Oh, God.
It's still 21 votes.
But you won.
You won, Leslie.
You won by 21 votes.
It's confirmed.
It's over.
You won.
That was really sneaky, Ann.
I know.
I couldn't resist.
Honestly, I've never been more relieved in my entire life.
I didn't ruin it.
I thought I ruined it, but I didn't ruin it.
You're kind of ruining it now.
Great.
That is great news.
I'm going to see you in D.C. - Yeah, I guess you will.
- Yeah.
Oh, damn it.
Didn't get a chance to say good-bye to Chris.
Oh, he's just right over there.
Eh.
He seems really busy.
Anyway, would you tell him I said good-bye?
Great!
Thank you.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to meet.
- I'm Ann.
- That doesn't matter.
I'm leaving.
Congratulations, Mr. Assistant City Manager.
I'm very grateful, Chris, but I think I'm going to turn down the job.
Really?
Why?
I like where I am.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
Did someone just talk about a job opening?
Because guess who's got two thumbs and was just cleared from insurance fraud?
This guy, you know?
Got off on a technicality What's the gig?
I'm in.
There's no job for you.
Smart move.
Go with your gut.
All right?
I'll talk to you guys soon.
Your victory speech, Councilwoman Knope.
Some day, when I'm more emotionally stable, I want to read the concession speech you wrote for me.
I never wrote it.
And I know all of you know how hard she worked to get here.
She is the next city councilwoman from the great city of Pawnee, ladies and gentlemen, my best friend in the world, Leslie Knope.
The idea behind this campaign was a simple one: That with hard work and positivity, a group of people can make a difference during my term as your city councilor Thank you.
I want to focus on your hopes and not your fears.
I want to solve problems instead of creating friction.
And I will work hard every hour of every day to make Pawnee a better place to live because I love this city.
And I know firsthand, how very special the people of this city are.
I owe this victory, all of it, to my friends and my supporters.
No one achieves anything alone.
So let's embark on a new journey together.
Let's break out a map.
Not the old, out-of-date one that shows where we've been, but a crisp new one that shows where we might go.
Let's embark on a new journey together and see where it takes us.
Tommy!
This party was amazing, you're amazing.
You are ridiculous, but I like you, and I think that we should date--all of it.
Let's do it.
Let's date.
This is my dream.
Nostra-Thomas is happening.
- Awesome.
- Hey, let's move in together.
Phhhht!
Totally.
- Really?
- Yeah.
All right, no take-backs when we sober up, little partner.
No take-backs, partner.
We're cowboys.
Great win, great night.
Great year.
Hot wife.
Jackpot.
Good job, me.
Oh, my God.
Babe.
You know what?
Almost everything you wrote on that board as a dream job was some type of police officer.
Yeah.
You ready to go?
No, listen to me.
- Mm-hmm.
- How does this sound?
"Officer Dwyer, Pawnee PD".
Guys, we're going to JJ's for victory waffles, and then we're staying up all night talking about our lives and our feelings.
Nonnegotiable.
Let's go!
City council, bitches!
- Jerry forgot to vote.
- Damn it, Jerry.
