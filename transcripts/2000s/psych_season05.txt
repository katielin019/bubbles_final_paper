{START OF EPISODE 1}
Last season on Psych.
We've been discussing creating a new position, a liaison, working with other departments, agencies, outside help.
Psychics.
You better do something quick!
I can't hold this for long!
We got you.
I accept.
Excuse me?
The job.
The job you offered me, Karen, I accept.
It's great to be back.
Okay, I'm warning you guys, Gus knows karate.
Um, I don't know karate.
Yes, you do.
I study Wushu.
It's Chinese.
Dude, trust me, karate sounds more intimidating.
I've only had two lessons.
That's two more lessons than they've had.
Come on, man, my dad wouldn't let me take karate, so now you've got to do this.
You do it.
You do it.
I don't fire people well, you know that.
You wanted the assistant.
I wanted a girl.
He's the only one who would take the job, Shawn.
What does that say about us?
We'll do good cop, bad cop.
Who's bad cop?
You.
You're the unscrupulous, penny-pinching boss, with a chip on your shoulder and mommy issues.
I'm the nurturing, confidant type, who's, like, "Dude, Gus is a jerk but I've got your back".
Together we'll take that sucker down.
Nope.
Together then.
Fine.
Ken!
And it turns out business is just a little slower than expected.
You guys hired me four days ago.
Much slower.
But the thing is my dad got a job at the police station, right?
So we assumed that we'd get more cases.
He assumed.
I called this from a mile away.
Exactly.
Wait a Holy crap, you're doing good cop.
I know.
Did somebody move my desk?
I didn't see anyone.
How many days a week are you here?
Two, three, depends.
I just deal with the consultants.
But you don't tell me what to do, right?
I'm not sure.
I am.
You don't.
Think of it like Santa Barbara is having a slow news day, but with murder and stuff.
And like the real estate market, crime will always trend upwards.
The only thing we know for sure, it's going to pick up.
And that real estate is a sound long term investment.
But mostly that crime's going to pick up and that's a guarantee.
Excuse, Mr. Chiang, can I get a photo of you and your family for the Santa Barbara Courier?
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, please have your raffle tickets when entering the Santa Barbara Chinatown Festival.
Thank you.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know Buzz, she didn't come back on Monday?
No.
Not yet.
Just let our people do their work.
If and when we get the ransom call we will determine our course of action.
Mr. Chiang, I'm the resident psychic here.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
This is my partner Jonathan Jacob "Jingly" Schmidt.
You're saying his name is John Jacob "Jingleheimer" Schmidt?
That's correct, sir.
We used to share the name.
I changed mine because of all the people shouting when I went out.
I don't remember calling you, Mr. Spencer.
Didn't have to, Chief.
This case called me.
It called collect.
That's right.
Which was odd, because I'm also on Twitter.
And the cases usually tweet me.
Let's be honest, Chief, kidnapping is my thing.
This case is tailor-made for a psychic.
I guess it does make a little bit of sense.
Karen, you called Shawn in?
Case called me.
Collect.
Naturally this is your call, Henry.
You now oversee our consultants.
So this would officially be your first hire.
Okay, then.
My answer's no.
What?
May I speak to you in private?
All right, what the hell was that about?
It's my job to determine if we need a consultant, and right now I don't see the need for one.
You've had five opportunities to hire us, now what is this really about?
Are you familiar with the term "persona non grata"?
Why are we talking about food?
Shawn, there's a reason they created the position I'm in.
You burned a lot of bridges around here.
You made a lot of sloppy mistakes.
You're going to have to earn your way back.
Things are going to be different now.
It's so unfair.
Is it?
Yeah.
My results speak for themselves.
You just hold me to a different standard.
I do not.
You buried my Easter eggs five feet underground.
And I left loose dirt to indicate a fresh dig.
Yeah, under a camouflage tarp covered with bricks and broken glass.
That was the giveaway.
Oh, pardon Pardon me for trying to challenge you.
It took me three weeks to "close" the egg investigation.
I was eight.
Yeah, well, just so you know, there's still two eggs you haven't found.
You're sick.
Well, what happened?
Two things, one, we're getting him fired.
Two, we're on the case.
After all that you convinced him to hire us?
Define convinced.
Buzz, have we searched the kidnap girl's apartment?
They just finished.
Great.
We'll need that address.
Oh, you guys got hired on the case?
Well, define hired.
Shawn, the police have already been here.
She was kidnapped on the other side of town.
It's been hours, Gus, and still no ransom demand.
I'm telling you this is not your standard kidnapping.
God, everything's so neat.
Maybe she's a neat person.
Or maybe she's hiding something.
This closet, full of new purchases.
Please tell me we're taking that to the police.
We are.
Just not the ones working this case.
Bring that to Lassiter.
What would be the fun in that?
I want you for this.
Chief wouldn't hire you guys, huh?
Look, I got case-blocked by my own father, okay?
Don't you think it's time you got back up on the horse?
It's a temporary reassignment.
It's pretty common for cops when they experience something traumatic.
Look, I know the whole Yin thing was difficult for everybody.
But at this point, it just feels like you're hiding here at this giant post office.
It's City Hall, Shawn.
We have a City Hall?
I just need a little time, and I am perfectly content staying off of this case.
Oh, really?
Did you know there's no ransom note?
Did you know that Bekki Chiang stands to inherit approximately $20 million, and is already being groomed for an ambassadorship at 19?
Not my case.
It's Lassiter's.
What?
It's an old Hong Kong Which dynasty?
Look at that.
Somebody's helping already.
There is one other thing.
It's counterfeit.
A smart, rich girl with a secret, holding on to counterfeit money.
And just what are you doing here?
The mayor asked to see me.
Clearly we don't believe that.
You're free to believe what you want.
Please don't say that to Gus.
Now he'll just tell you that Michael Jackson isn't dead.
He learned how to fake his death from Lisa Marie.
Which implies that Elvis is still alive.
Elvis died two years ago.
Is there no end to your gullibility?
I told you that two years ago.
He was a cashier in a shoe shop.
No, Gus, no.
No.
I'm not having this conversation with you now or ever.
We're not sure what the deal with wrapping on the hand is, and he He leapt a wall into the crowd, so he's athletic.
Kept his face covered the whole time.
Couldn't get a clear shot of him.
It's almost as if he knew there were cameras there.
Carlton, I have a lot of work to do here, so if you wouldn't Oh, my God, we're on the same page.
You were trying to lure her out of this dungeon by using details from the case.
I am not.
See?
It's not just me.
You're concerned about her insisting on staying down here, the unreturned phone calls, and the ever so slight darkening of the hair.
I hadn't noticed.
I like it.
Thank you, Gus, now would you guys please just leave me alone?
Way to go, Spencer, you are not on this case.
What?
Lassie, we've clearly crossed a threshold.
Tomorrow, we should wear matching jumpsuits, nay, t-shirts.
I'll be thing one, you be thing two.
Excuse me.
Wait, before you go, one question.
Who would counterfeit a 50-cent piece?
Hong Kong.
Nine-seventy-eight dynasty.
Ooh, that makes so much more sense.
You can't seriously tell me you think the Triads are involved in this?
Triads?
Athletes.
Chinese gangs.
Athletic gangs of Chinese men.
Very serious gangs.
How do we speak with these Triads?
You don't speak with them.
They're an underground society.
You're saying I need to make an appointment.
Spencer, look, there are different gangs within the Triads.
What are we talking?
Are we talking about the Golden Triad, the Dragon Triad?
Regular.
I think we're primarily interested in medium.
Venti.
Venti is large.
Well, then not venti.
We'll speak with both gangs.
No.
Spencer, you will stay away from these people.
They are legitimately dangerous, and those two gangs have been on the verge of war for years.
Now, if you'll excuse me, the free information train has left the station.
You'll just have to figure it all out for yourself.
Please.
Like we can't do that.
We need information.
Whoa, wait.
You guys aren't here to pay me for my last day?
I believe I did pay you.
We didn't pay him anything.
We paid him in gratitude and life lessons.
I knew I shouldn't have opened this door.
Ken, don't think of it as not being paid for your last day, think of it as a surprise two-year vacation.
Unpaid.
We will hire you back.
Someday.
Probably not soon though.
Why are you guys here?
We need information on counterfeiting Hong Kong coins.
And Chinese mafia.
And we need you to explain the ending of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon to us.
What?
What, you guys think that because I'm Asian I'm supposed to know all this stuff?
That's borderline racist, man.
Racist?
No, I hardly think so.
Inappropriate?
Yes.
Insulting?
Sure.
Stereotyping?
Not racist.
Sure.
Maybe a little racist.
Gus, please.
Now, Ken, how many Triads do you know?
Andlor are you one of them?
Wow.
Okay, that definitely crossed the line.
Just tell us what you know and we will get out of your parent's house.
Okay, the only thing I can think of is there's this place where the Golden Triads used to hang out.
Okay, the only reason I know that is because my mother used to forbid me to go there.
Gus, all I'm saying is that sometimes your jokes don't land.
Okay, Shawn, you want to impose some restrictions on me, then I want go with some rules too.
What rules?
In the past, you've offered me up as some sort of sacrificial lamb to the situation.
Name one.
Wait, never mind, you're right.
New rule, from now on, any cover story or fake ID must be run past me and approved.
Approved?
In writing, three days in advance.
Gus, you're kidding, right?
No, Shawn.
I need the proper amount of time to concoct my alter ego that best compliments yours in the situation.
I don't know where I'm going to be living in three days.
That's the deal, Shawn.
Take it or leave it.
So he is a pharmaceutical salesman who moonlights at a psychic detective agency, and once at camp he wet his pants.
Water splashed on my pants.
I'm sorry, you guys are cops?
Nope.
Not cops.
Though sometimes we work with cops and occasionally against them.
Look, if this was Saturday I'd have a much better story.
Right now, all I want to do is talk to some Triads.
Either kind.
You guys know you're going to get killed?
You know what, you're absolutely right.
What were we thinking?
Gus?
Yes.
See what I mean.
See what I mean?
We got lucky.
We have been following this guy forever.
If he is a Triad, he's the most boring gang member of all time.
I think Ken gave us a fake lead to pay you back for asking him for a loan.
It was a short-term loan, Gus.
With interest.
The interest was life lessons, Shawn.
Oh, those are some heavy firearms.
Something's going down.
Run back to the Psych office, grab our ninja costumes.
How can that possibly help us?
We need to get closer.
No, we are staying here.
Gus, 10 seconds ago, you were complaining about being bored.
Now suddenly it's too exciting?
It'd be great to get some consistency from you emotionally.
Shawn, if something illegal is going on, then it's our duty to call Lassiter and let him get shot.
Golden Triads cut off hands.
One at a time, which technically means we have four opportunities.
I'm not moving.
They won't even know we're here.
I blame you.
I think he said something about taking us to see the boss.
If only I had time to submit a fake identity for approval.
Do not mock me when I'm about to get killed, Shawn.
You know I bond with authority.
This is a win for us.
I will talk my way out of this.
How?
You know how much I love Yao Ming, that's got to count for something.
Just leave me out of this.
Okay, first of all, this is some sort of huge misunderstanding.
I know and respect that you are a very busy man, running a crime syndicate is a full-time job.
And we do not want to bother you any more than we have to Mr. Chiang.
I know you.
You're the psychic from the police station.
Yes.
That's correct.
They hired us on this case.
The Chief said they did not.
I don't know why she'd say something like that.
She said it to you.
Yes, she did.
That's a little act we do to throw people off.
To throw who off?
Mr. Chiang, I found this coin in your daughter's apartment.
It was pretty well hidden.
My fear is that she's mixed up with some pretty nasty criminals.
This is my coin.
I gave it to her to symbolize our past.
Now, I will say this to you, and I will speak slowly so you understand.
She's not mixed up in any of this.
This criminal activity?
What you think you see here, is not criminal.
It seems pretty criminal to me.
Our mistake.
It's just a handful of buddies hanging out, taking some long distance surveillance photos, and carrying semiautomatic weapons.
You have an idea of who took your daughter, don't you?
I do not.
And you wouldn't lie to me.
You're a psychic.
You tell me.
Are we free to go?
Go.
All right.
It's got a curly "Q" thing on the end here.
The whole thing kind of looks like a dragon.
I know this because I saw something like it once in a Panda Express.
Can you tell us what it is or not?
Dude, my parents run a Best Buy.
I told you.
You didn't know about the Best Buy.
I told you he would be offended.
He's not offended.
I'm very offended.
He's excited.
He's getting a taste of the kind of action that you and I get into.
If we hadn't had to let him go due to unforeseen circumstances Guys!
Do you realize that I've done more work for you since you fired me?
Yes, we do.
Have you seen this dragon?
Yeah.
I probably saw something like that spray-painted on a wall.
Where?
Chinatown.
What?
Where in Chinatown?
A martial arts studio.
Why does this have orange chicken sauce all over it?
Oh, because it got me in the mood for some Panda Express.
Can you tell us what this is?
Dragon Triads.
Shawn, what do you want from me?
That's what they were doing.
They were surveilling their sworn enemies.
Wait, who was doing what?
That doesn't matter.
It also doesn't matter whether we were captured by these people or not.
The question is, what would happen if the Dragon Triad kidnapped someone from the family of the Golden Triad?
It's a ridiculous theory, Shawn.
It would never happen.
Let's just say it did.
Well, it would start off a gang war.
It's beyond suicide.
Yeah, she's right.
The Goldens and Dragons can't even be seen in each other's territory.
Ugh, I am going to have all of you banned from this building.
Excuse me, I'm here for a class.
This class?
Yeah, I believe it starts in Five minutes.
Right, five minutes from now.
I'm usually 10 minutes early, so I'm already feeling behind.
This class is for five to eight-year-olds.
Yes, yes it is.
And, uh, that's what I call Discrimination.
Discrimination?
Yes, and ageism.
Who are you?
I'm his lawyer.
That's right.
You brought a lawyer?
I keep a lawyer on retainer at all times.
There's so much injustice in the world that you practically can't leave home without one.
And apparently, today it paid off.
Right, okay.
Well, I will see you in court, then.
Now Perfect.
Now I need a statement from you.
And as we plan to try this in both civil and criminal court, I'll need the police here as well.
Can I use you phone, or do you only let the white people use that?
Who said anything about white people?
You just did.
The words "white people" did not come out of my mouth.
There they are again.
Luckily I had my hand recorder on for that one.
By the way, I am now disclosing that this conversation is being recorded.
Recorded?
Okay, this is crazy.
Crazy?
You want to know crazy?
I sued 300 businesses last year alone.
I sued a hot dog cart and got everything but the wheels and the buns, which I won in the civil case two months later.
Dude.
I think he gets it now.
I know, but the words are coming out of my mouth faster than I can think of them.
Bring it home.
Now, if you don't mind, before I start snapping evidence photos, I'm a little parched, so can you tell me which one of these fountains I'm allowed to use?
That one.
I mean, you pick, sir.
One!
Ha!
Two!
Ha!
Three!
Ha!
Four!
Ha!
Five!

Ha!
Five!
Ha!
Ow!
What?
Focus!
Sorry.
You have no focus.
Why?
I Look, it's just You want to know the truth?
My dad never let me take karate.
Okay?
This is not karate!
Right, okay, but it's pretty much the same thing.
Not the same thing.
All right.
Now turn your eyes around and follow.
One!
Ha!
Two!
Ha!
Three!
Ha!
Four!
Ha!
Five!
Ha!
Six!
Ha!
Back.
And bow.
Did you find out anything?
Yes.
What?
I'm awesome at karate.
Wushu.
Yeah, that.
I'm awesome at it.
You were in there for two hours and all you did was kung fu?
No.
We stretched our groins, we meditated.
Did you find out anything about the case, Shawn?
Yes.
What?
I'm pretty sure upstairs is the headquarters for the Dragon Triad.
I think they might be hiding the girl there, but that's not important right now.
Not important?
Gus, I kicked a board in half.
No, you didn't.
You're right.
I didn't.
But it splintered.
Do you have any idea what this means?
It means I sat outside for two hours while you fulfilled a childhood dream.
Let's stake this place out tonight.
And I'll need $300 for the initiation fee.
You signed up for class?
They are the bad guys.
Upstairs.
Master Wu is not affiliated with these hooligans.
Chief?
How are you doing, O'Hara?
Good.
Great.
Great.
Great.
Great.
Great.
Great.
You know, there's no shame in feeling what you're feeling.
That Yin case is the kind of thing that can shut a person down.
You too, Chief.
Okay, I will come back to work when I am ready.
I'm not here to force your hand, just wanted to ask.
I just They say to take some time.
It's recommended.
Of course.
Just make sure you know when the healing ends and the delaying begins.
Of course.
I will.
Thank you.
Great.
So here you go.
Stop light safety project.
Just track and compare every light in the city, cross-reference with each stop sign.
Tell me if two years isn't enough of a sample to draw a conclusion.
I'll have McNab bring the rest down later.
Good luck, O'Hara.
That was it.
I think that's why my dad wouldn't let me take karate when I was a kid, Gus, because he knew, he knew I was too good.
Too dangerous.
One moment I'd be mastering the high kick, the next, I'd be holding a beating heart in my hand.
Uh, Shawn?
What?
Is that our Kidnapper.
Only one way to find out.
The second floor window is open.
I saw this in a Jackie Chan movie.
We're going to climb the building, bounce wall to wall You can't bounce to the second floor.
Excuse me?
I think you're neglecting my martial arts training.
Are you talking about the one class you had today?
Yes, Gus, I am.
You know what, just give me a boost.
All right.
We're in.
Hey, man, we know you're the kidnapper.
We can do this the easy way or the You must be out of your damn We're not with this guy.
We never even met.
Actually we just now met him.
After we broke in.
Accidentally broke in.
We fell through a window, which technically isn't breaking in.
And in our defense, this is the guy that's stealing stuff.
Yeah, he already had the safe open.
Which he didn't have to crack, which means he's a pro.
And he stole a jacket which is a weird thing to steal.
Agreed.
Especially since he already had a sweatshirt.
And it's not even that cold outside.
So, you see, we're a couple good Samaritans.
Don't worry.
We don't expect a reward.
Silence!
Look, man, you don't get it!
We don't want to fight you guys!
Even though we're evenly matched.
Evenly matched?
It's three on three.
I've had my lesson.
You had your karate.
It's not karate, Shawn.
It's Wushu.
Wushu sounds more authentic.
It sounds delicious is what it sounds.
I'm going in.
Gus, those are cleaning supplies.
Maybe we should just chill out and wait for these guys kill each other.
He went that way.
I'm trying to stay alive, Shawn.
Gus, that is our kidnapper.
Trust me, I can scale that in a single leap.
What?
Shawn.
Shawn?
We lost him.
He's right behind us.
I'm talking about the guy we're chasing.
I'm talking about the guy chasing us!
Gus, my spiritual senses are out of control.
I can't believe I didn't turn to eastern culture earlier.
Shawn, we got lucky because we hid like little girls.
Gus, don't be the Ten Tigers of Canton.
We've reached a new level.
I rest my case.
I couldn't get a clear shot of him.
It's almost as if he knew there were cameras there.
Dude, that's it.
That's her jacket.
We found her.
I'll call the police.
No, no, no, Gus.
That was so us last week.
We've been riding everyone's coattails this whole time.
I say we take him down now.
What do you mean now?
Shawn!
Are you coming in or what?
I was waiting.
It's been 10 minutes.
I could be dead already.
If you recall, I didn't want to go in, in the first place.
So you leave me there with our suspect?
What was your plan exactly?
I was waiting to hear if there was any screaming, then depending on how bad it sounded I would go forth from there.
And if there was any pleading, that was also a variable.
Holy crap!
Are you checking e-mail?
I need to be productive when I get nervous, Shawn.
Just come on.
God bless.
Gus, this is Sang Tan.
His father is the leader of the Dragon Triad.
This is the lovely Bekki and they are in love.
And your father is the leader of the Golden Triad?
I get it.
It's Romeo and Juliet.
Kind of.
Our relationship was discovered.
I had to get her safe.
People die for these kinds of indiscretions.
I went to her in the alley and we ran.
Things got out of control.
You need to tell the police that this is not a kidnapping.
It's not that simple.
It's pretty simple.
I'm pregnant.
My father will never stand for this.
I've been chosen to take over for him when he retires.
There's no changing that plan.
I just need a day, get some cash and get some things in order.
You're part Chinese, Shawn, you must understand.
You're damn right I do.
You told him you were Chinese?
Gus, I am part Chinese, now.
We'll never make it like this.
Can you help us?
Of course we will.
Absolutely not.
Let me get this straight, Mr. Spencer, you're saying that we should stop the investigation?
Yes, indeed.
Chief, I am sensing that there is more going on here than meets the eye.
Well, that's certainly a tactic that we've never tried before.
And what are you also suggesting, that we cross our fingers and perhaps hope for the best?
I have an idea of what we can do.
Shh, Gus, don't.
Don't do it.
Don't.
Chief, before, moments ago, it was fuzzy.
I'm upgrading it to crystal clear.
Wait, I want to be sure.
Yes, crystal clear.
This is not a kidnapping.
Really?
If it's not a kidnapping why did we just get this?
Wait!
I'm getting something else.
Look, I am telling you I am right.
I know she was here.
She was standing right here.
I can see it plain as day.
Right next to the man who some believe to be her kidnapper.
How sure are you?
As sure as I am that the guy who just 'friended Gus online is not the guy who played R2-D2.
His name is Kenny Baker, Shawn.
Fine.
Why would Kenny Baker want to be friends with you?
Why would Elvira want to be friends with you?
Her name's Cassandra Peterson.
Okay, we found Bekki Chiang's bracelet, a few other belongings.
She was indeed here, so good work, Mr. Spencer.
Thank you.
Just a little late.
Chief, look at this.
What is it?
It's traces of blood.
You were here, weren't you?
Yeah a little.
You had to go out and play psychic and now the girl might be dead.
Trust me, Dad, there are a lot of things in play here.
She didn't get kidnapped, she ran off with the guy.
She's in love with the Dragon Triad, and here's the kicker.
Guess who the leader of the Golden Triads is?
Arthur Chiang.
You knew that?
Of course I knew that.
Cops have been trying to nail him for years, Shawn.
Why do you think I didn't want to let you in on this case?
Do not say you're protecting me.
I wasn't protecting you.
But these are seriously dangerous people, Shawn.
Dad, you're not listening to me.
I've got this.
It's Romeo and Juliet, man.
It's West Side Story.
I don't know which one is the Jets and which one is the Dolphins.
Sharks.
That is all that is going on here.
And how exactly do you know all this?
She told me.
She told you?
Ah, any chance she said it under duress?
I caught them kissing.
Ah, did he have a gun?
No.
I'm assuming, no.
That's exactly what I'm talking about, Shawn.
You got played, kid.
What?
Now go home.
You've done enough.
That doesn't even I know what I saw.
They lied to us.
They didn't lie.
Maybe they were in it together.
They needed money, they fleeced you because you're either romantic or stupid.
I know when people are in love.
What now, guys?
You know Romeo and Juliet, right?
DiCaprio and Danes?
It's a play, too.
Sure it is.
What if I said Bekki Chiang got mixed up with the Triads, the Golden ones and fell in love with a Dragon?
She didn't get kidnapped, she's out there making kissy face with her guy pal.
There's a ransom note, Shawn.
Aha!
You are following the case.
Only enough to know that you're wrong.
Really?
If it's not a kidnapping, why did we just get this?
Wait a minute.
That was no ransom note.
No money was asked for.
I don't follow you.
That doesn't make any sense, Shawn.
Why would he send a photo that's going to incite a panic?
Who's he?
Romeo?
The son.
The son?
The Tan family.
Which one?
What do you mean "which one"?
There are two.
Two?
Two sons.
This is Sang Tan.
He's number two in the gang.
Now this is the other brother.
Which one did you meet?
I met them both.
Teno is an enforcer.
He's somewhere in the middle.
Whoa, this guy is the toughest member of the crew by far.
Why isn't he next in line?
He's a big problem.
He crosses territorial lines.
This guy likes to poke the bear.
The Goldens and the Dragons have at peace for a while.
This guy has a history of inciting trouble.
The only reason Teno makes sense as a leader is in a time of war between the Triads.
And I don't see that happening any time soon.
Our relationship was discovered.
I had to get her safe.
I do.
And I know who kidnapped the girl.
Shawn, this is a bad idea.
Come on, Gus, we've got this.
It's the brothers.
I just realized what you do when brothers are fighting.
What?
You tell their dad.
I still can't believe you called a meeting with the head of the Dragon Triad.
Summit.
Meeting.
It was relatively easy after I revealed I had jaw-dropping information about his two sons.
Just get to it.
Hi, there, Mr. Han Tan.
Or is it Mr. Tan Han?
See, I get confused because the back of Yao Ming's jersey says "Yao" not "Ming".
Shawn.
Let me start off by saying I love ping-pong and General Chao's chicken and your version of checkers.
I find your fire drills to be immensely entertaining, David Bowie's China Girl.
The naked version.
That goes without saying.
I have also practiced the ancient martial art of Wushu under the tutelage of your fine people.
Shawn, get on with it.
I'm endearing myself to him.
Stop endearing.
Your son wants to start a war between the Triads.
Teno.
The mean one.
Maybe you have your own way of differentiating them, but for me, personally, I think he's the meanest.
Maybe it's the tattoo.
Just the general demeanor.
Use of brow.
Sometimes you just get a vibe about someone.
Shawn.
Hold that thought.
I don't think he speaks any English.
Oh!
Thank god.
I thought it was just me.
What do we do?
I set plan B in motion.
Until then we're just going to have to use the international method of communication.
You're not going to attempt charades, are you?
One word.
Oh, my gosh.
West Side Story.
That's three words.
Your son Sang, the nice one, dark sweatshirt, is in love with Mr. Chiang's daughter.
Also nice.
Very nice.
Ah, here's the part you won't like.
She is pregnant.
Preggers with your grandbaby.
There is a Chinese bun in the oven.
She's actually not showing yet.
There's not a bump at all.
Safe to say that we're still in the first trimester now.
Shawn, this is not working.
I'm working my butt off.
He's giving me nothing.
I didn't do anything!
Don't worry.
I can hear plan B right outside.
I didn't do anything, man.
What are you people doing?
Oh, go suck yourselves!
Thank God you're here, Ken.
Why am I here?
We need a translator.
We solved the case.
But we can't tell anybody.
Because they can't understand what we're saying.
Dude, I speak nine words of Chinese.
Six of those are numbers.
All right, let's not panic.
I think we can use this.
Which numbers do you know?
Enough!
I understand you.
You do!
Man, you Mr. Han Tan.
Han Shawn.
You have spent working very hard to keep peace between yourself and the Golden Triads, and your son Teno wants to rip it apart.
If you know where he is, you have to tell us.
If I am found with the kidnapped girl, the bloodshed will never stop.
We cannot get involved.
Right.
But we can.
So if you know where he is you gotta give him up.
Yeah, I'm about to solve the kidnapping.
I need you to bring backup.
Shawn, call Lassiter.
Nope.
Not doing it.
Stop it.
I am not coming.
No, it's gotta be you.
Listen, Jules, Yin came after me too, okay?
I'm not going to let this guy keep me from living.
I need you or I go down alone.
Well, with Gus.
You know what I mean.
You all right?
He's just outside.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Wake up.
We need you.
Wake up, Sang.
Gus, what are you doing?
I'm trying to wake him up.
We need him to help us escape.
I told you, man, I've got us covered.
Don't say it, Shawn.
You are not a kung fu expert.
Technically, no.
Not yet.
But I didn't show you this, man.
They're mostly just stretches, but there's some lethal combinations here on page three.
Teno!
We got you.
I figured it all out.
Really?
Yeah, really.
You felt betrayed by your brother here, right?
More than that, you were jealous that you weren't selected to take over.
See, Sang's a little soft, in your eyes, isn't he?
Unfit to lead.
But a war between the Triads, that would be your opportunity to shine.
Teno, the enforcer.
You knew who it was the night we left.
Isn't that right?
This is the guy that's stealing stuff.
Yeah, the safe was already open.
Which he didn't have to crack, which means he's a pro.
And he stole a jacket, which is a weird thing to steal.
You were the one who discovered that your brother was consorting with your most hated enemy.
Our relationship was discovered.
And we lead you right to him.
He's right behind us.
You broke into that room and you took matters into your own hands.
Luckily the kidnapping fell right in your lap and all you had to do was snap a ransom photo Wake up.
Make up enough evidence to put the blame on your brother there and wait.
Wait for a war that you have always wanted to start.
Come on.
Wake up.
Oh, relax dude.
Whoa, with the ma Dude, I have made it through all seven levels of Shaq Fu on Nintendo and Gus can attest to that.
Sang, wake up.
All right.
Let's do this.
I execute this properly no can defend.
You got it, Shawn.
You got it!
Help is on the way!
Any minute now, Shawn!
Your sensei teach you how to fight with stick?
Yeah.
Be like water, Shawn!
I got your back, Shawn!
Crouching Tiger, Shawn!
Crouching Tiger!
Keep going!
Help is coming!
Fist of Fury!
Fist of Fury!
Wushu fever!
You're not helping.
We're coming.
Oh, man!
Really?
Oh!
Good work, Jules.
Yeah, he'd just surrendered before you got here.
He surrendered when I walked in, Shawn.
Oh, God!
You know, Dad, none of this would have happened if you just let me take karate lessons as a kid.
But you know what, I get it.
You saw that I had too much potential, didn't you?
You knew that I would be way too dangerous to train.
Shawn, I didn't let you take karate because you had zero control of your body.
I had too much control of my body.
Are you out of your mind?
You used to run around karate-chopping everything in the house.
I thought you'd kill yourself.
All right.
Agree to disagree.
But know this, from now on I can handle the rough stuff, okay?
I am my own person.
My body is a weapon.
I don't need you to protect me, okay?
Fair enough.
But in return, you never put me in a position having to lie for you.
This isn't just about you anymore, kid.
I'm a player in this game, too.
You find a victim, you find a perpetrator you call me first before you put your hand to your head.
First?
First.
How about first-ish?
No.
Thanks.
I was about to say the same thing to you.
I may have needed a kick in the pants to get going.
I would never kick you in the pants.
You didn't give up.
And I'll never give up.
What do you think?
Should we hug?
We could.
There you are.
Rain check.
Hey.
Chief said you're working on a special project.
Thought you could work on these too.
Oh, now you're going to ply me with additional work?
Carlton, these are your taxes.
Hey, I'm trying to help you.
And this is how you help me?
Well, you're here, aren't you?
It's already working.
I think my spine might be liquid.
Did you tell the cops you single-handedly took out Teno Tan?
That was an assumption that they made.
From what?
I may have left out two verbs an adjective and the words, "Juliet arrived".
But other than that it was mostly facts.
You realize you have to sign your statement?
Not if we leave right now, I don't.
How about some Panda Express?
Had that last night.
Pick Up Stix?
Had it this morning.
P.F. Chang's.
You know that's right.
Go.
Gus, those are cleaning supplies.
One more time.
Let's go back.
Yeah, let's go back.
Let's go back.
He assumed.
I called this from a mile away.
Holy crap, you're doing good cop.
We can do this the easy way or You must be out of your damn We can do this the easy way or You must be out of your damn What are we waiting for?
Put your seatbelt on, Shawn.
Oh, for crying Just start the Wow.
That's all we need, right?
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Hey, Gus.
What are you doing?
Just playing board grass.
Gus, let me see what's behind your back.
Tap shoes?
Are you kidding me?
Shawn, I like tap dancing.
In fact, I'm pretty good at it.
When people pick on me, I just pull out that tap board and show them who's bad.
Dude, all your permanent teeth are in, okay?
You're playing for keeps now.
You should try it.
It's cool.
All right, what have we got?
Female victim.
Looks like she was trapped inside her vehicle and drowned.
It must have been horrible.
Whoa, O'Hara, maybe I should handle this one, you know, until you get your sea legs back.
I am fine.
I want to help.
Okay, take notes.
Tall coffee, black.
I'm off the cream and sugar.
Carlton.
I'm sorry, O'Hara, I'm pulling rank on this one.
There will be plenty of other females who die horrific deaths, and you can investigate all of them when you're ready.
Get yourself something, too.
I'll get the next one.
Hope she doesn't remember that.
Listen, McNab, I'm still covering a butt-Ioad of cases I took on while O'Hara was on vacation.
She was on stress leave.
Tomato, tomato.
Point is, until she's ready for duty again, I'm going to need an extra set of hands, so pad up.
Copy.
Spencer, keep your pie hole shut until I assess my crime scene.
Nothing shuts my pie hole but pie.
Come on.
We're going to have to get close enough to that body to get a reading.
Why do you need to get a reading off a soggy corpse?
Why can't you just point at it from here or touch the car instead?
Why don't you get a reading off of that bird over there?
All right, this vehicle matches the description of the one our missing person was last seen in.
Copy.
Stop saying "Copy".
Roger.
Victim is identified as Desiree Blake.
Rained last night, right?
Yep.
She took this curve too fast, lost control, went down the embankment, drowned in the car.
Put time of death sometime yesterday on the 12th.
She wasn't in the car long.
We're on.
Lassie?
I'm afraid we don't have an accidental drowning here.
Our Desiree Blake was murdered.
You are so predictable, Spencer.
As predictable as your next date ending with the words, "I hope this never happens to someone else"?
Spencer, stop wasting my time.
You know how this works, you want in, you make a case to your father, who's done nothing but say no to you ever since he was made head of consultants.
Thank God.
I'd be lying if I said I like having to ask my dad for case assignments.
I'd also be lying if I said Val Kilmer still looks like Val Kilmer.
I still have hope.
Me too.
We got to convince Lassie to put us on this case.
Uh, you have to do that.
I don't have time.
My new tap class starts in half an hour.
Hey, hey, hey, you're really taking tap?
That wasn't just a bit we were doing?
Dude, I'm doing something for myself, getting back to things I love.
For a brief period in '93, I was known as DJ Cold Cuts.
Now, do you see me dusting off my turntables and playing the Curves downtown?
The Curves burnt down last year.
No wonder they won't return my calls.
I'll see you after class.
Guster, may I have a word?
Am I to understand you're taking a tap class?
Yes.
Is it court ordered?
No.
Will it make you faster?
No.
Are you investigating some sort of dancing drug ring?
No.
Well, then why on earth would a grown man do such a thing?
Look, it's something I've been doing since I was a child.
And I don't care whether you and Shawn don't get it.
One, two, three, four.
All right, let's try that one more time.
Some of your timing was a little off.
Not necessary, Mr. Guster, I can see everyone in the mirror.
Oh, sorry.
Nice moves by the way.
Oh, thanks, well, you know, I've been tapping since One, two, three, four.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Oh, let me guess, you want to move me to the advanced class?
No.
There's a co-worker waiting for you in the hall.
What?
I'm so sorry about this.
That's okay.
Shawn.
Lassiter, what are you doing here?
I thought you were working on your drowning case.
I got to wait for the science monkeys in forensics to analyze the evidence from the scene first.
So, I know this is a little weird, and I can't believe I'm here myself, but long story short, ever since the divorce, my therapist has advised me to step out of my comfort zone and try new things.
Since I don't like books that aren't about military strategy, nor do I care for the platonic company of women, I thought I'd see if you can get me into your little class here.
If you're doing it, how hard can it be, right?
You realize you're insulting me and asking me for a favor at the same time?
Give me a break, my insurance only covered four therapy sessions.
Lassiter, the kind of tap that I do is not something you can just jump into without experience.
Yeah, yeah.
I'll have them send over the transcripts from walking- and-chewing-gum school.
Can you get me in the class or not?
I don't have much time before the lab calls.
I'll see what I can do.
You're a peach.
One, a two, a one, two, three.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Cramp!
Got a cramp!
All right, hold on.
You were It's a wrap for today, everyone.
Great work.
Remember, keep it in the pocket.
I'll see you all next time, all right?
Yeah.
It's great.
All right.
You okay?
Yeah.
This is awesome.
I'm fine.
I mean, don't worry about it.
Everyone has a hard time the first time around.
It wasn't hard, it was just a waste of time.
I just hope my therapist doesn't make me come back.
Wait, you're quitting?
No, I'm not quitting.
I'm simply choosing not to continue.
Lassiter, I wanted you to realize how hard it was.
I didn't want to make you quit, especially because I believe that people who carry guns should do what their therapists say.
All right, look, let's try it again.
Come on.
Ridiculous, Guster.
It'll be something simple.
All right.
Let's try a cramp roll.
Ready?
That's it?
That's it.
Just like that.
Yeah.
Really?
Hey.
I think I'm actually starting to get it.
There might be something to this pansy stuff after all.
I don't know if "pansy" is the right word.
I know, but the alternative seemed a little offensive, so I thought I'd water it down.
I tell you, I'm starting to feel a little more relaxed.
All right, let's try something different.
Let's try a shuffle.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
Just like that.
You know, it's like focusing on the step is actually helping me clear my mind.
Exactly.
This is the clearest my mind's been in years.
I actually feel stress just melting away.
All right, try this one now.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Huh?
You like that?
All right.
So what are you stressed about?
Work.
The neighbor's suing me for killing his squirrels.
Mostly work.
You know that case you guys walked in on earlier?
Yeah.
Something about it just doesn't add up.
Found this bag of unmarked pills in her purse Crap!
What?
While I'm sitting here fooling around with you, I forgot to call the lab about the results.
Yeah, it's Lassiter.
Did you analyze that sample I brought in yet?
Are you kidding me?
How long does it take?
Oh, I don't know, I thought maybe you could tell me something, like what they are, where she bought them, anything.
Those pills weren't bought, they were made.
Huh?
They're lab trial samples.
How do you know?
I'm in pharmaceutical sales, remember?
Since when?
It doesn't matter.
Can you tell me who made these?
Well, there's only a handful of local labs that use that pentagonal shape.
Really?
Yeah.
Gus, are you busy right now?
Gus, there you are.
Your class let out just in time.
KFC is giving away Double Downs.
Dude, they're just giving them away.
What are you doing here?
I discovered after you two left the crime scene that I have a need for Guster's pharmaceutical expertise on this case, so I came here to find him.
You convinced Lassie to put us on the case.
Good work, buddy.
I said Guster's expertise, not yours.
Yeah.
We're a package, Lassie.
You don't get Jake "The Snake" Roberts without Damien the python.
Gus doesn't work solo.
Tell him, Gus.
Well, that's not actually true.
You have offended him by merely suggesting it.
Don't be angry.
I'm not.
Oh, no, now he's indignant.
You better back off, Jack.
Gus, without breathing fire through your sweet, sweet nostrils, tell him to back off.
I don't have time for this.
Guster, if you decide you want to help on the case alone, you're welcome to come with me.
Why aren't you laughing?
I'd only be helping with research.
It's no big deal.
No big deal?
You'd be working a case without me.
You've worked tons of cases without me.
Yeah, because I knew I could solve them.
Are you saying I can't solve a case without you?
No, I'm not saying that.
Because if we've learned anything over these few years, it's that you really can't do without me.
First of all, we haven't learned anything over the years.
And second of all, I'm the one with this.
So?
So, all you have is this You know what?
It's on.
It's not on.
It is on, Shawn.
Like mascara on Prince, it is on.
Lassie, count me in.
It's on!
I'm thrilled.
Get in the car.
And you know who has shotgun?
You.
Me.
Because Lassie's already behind the wheel.
Because it's on.
All right, fine, this is how you want to play it?
It is on.
No, no, I decide when it switches from off to on.
So it's off?
Yes.
Now it's on.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I'm Detective Carlton Lassiter.
This is my associate, Burton Guster.
What's wrong?
I'm not used to getting introduced by my real name.
Ma'am, are you familiar with these pills?
Yes, those look like our trial HCG hormone pills.
A fertility drug.
You are correct.
Very nice, Guster.
Thank you.
They're an experimental fertility treatment currently in phase three of clinical trials.
But they're not for public use.
Any idea how someone else could have gotten a hold of those?
Not a clue.
Unless they were a test subject.
True.
But I ran the trials alone and kept all of the test subject logs to myself.
Ma'am, those pills were found on a dead woman.
Oh, my goodness.
So we're going to need to see those logs immediately.
Of course.
You scared the crap out of her.
Yeah.
But a phase three trial is a double blind trial, meaning there has to be at least two administrators, that way the test group can have a different administrator than the placebo group.
So you're saying she lied?
There has to be another research technician.
Nice insight, Guster.
But why didn't you say something when she was still here?
You know Shawn.
I usually can't get a word in edgewise.
Oh, that's funny.
O'Hara usually just blurts out her opinions, as if I asked for them, or wanted them, or needed them.
Because women ruin everything.
Maybe now's a good time to call your therapist.
No, let's check on those logs first.
Let's see where she went.
Look, Gus, I'm getting handsy.
Shawn.
Oh, how's your little murder investigation coming along?
What are you doing here, Shawn?
Are you missing a murder weapon?
You can take the knife out of my back.
How did you find me, Shawn?
I installed GPS parental controls on your phone.
Is that why it keeps beeping?
It also tells me if you use your credit card to buy condoms, liquor or glue.
It's a little wasteful, don't you think?
I'm a player, Shawn.
You're not a player.
What are you doing here, Spencer?
We already interviewed the technician.
If Gus is allowed to show off his expertise, then I'm allowed to show off mine.
Spencer, we don't have time to watch you make a snowman out of mashed potatoes.
That's funny.
I'm getting something.
Someone else Someone Writing with their right hand.
Right-handed.
Yes, she had a partner.
We already know that.
You do?
Yes, we do.
Now, if you'll excuse us.
Guster.
Good luck getting hired on a case that I'm already on.
Good luck getting hired on my case that you're not on.
That doesn't make any sense.
Listen, Dad, I know exactly what you're going to say.
Yes, you can work on the case with Lassiter and Gus.
I had no idea you were going to say that.
Even though Lassiter only requested Gus, we still have to pay Psych your full rate.
I don't like the idea of you sitting around on your ass all day, collecting a check for doing nothing.
So I'm putting you to work.
So even when you do something I want, it still counts as some sort of punishment?
You're welcome.
Now I need to find you a partner.
Oh, I'll do it.
What case are we talking about?
The one Lassie's working with Gus.
Even better.
He's been treating me like a rookie ever since I took leave.
I am itching to get back out into the field, even if it means babysitting Shawn.
Fine.
You two are working the case together.
No reason for anything to fall through the cracks.
Babysit?
Really, Jules?
Come on.
Shawn, what have you done today?
Well, let's see, I watched some Phineas and Ferb Mmm.
Took a nap, had a snack.
I'm a little tired.
Exactly.
I just want to beat Lassie and Gus.
And catch the killer.
Sure.
Yeah, if that's what it takes, as long as we get to do our thing.
Chop it up, pound the pavement, walk the biz-neat.
First catch me up on what we're dealing with here.
Really am exhausted.
But I'm having a vision that the lab technician lied about not having another partner.
Well, then let's call her in and see what she's hiding.
What?
Sorry.
Oh.
Hey, what are you two doing here?
We're interviewing a witness.
What are you two doing here?
We're interviewing a witness.
Are you two working together now?
What happened?
They bust you down to the minors?
You go where you're appreciated.
I got two different calls asking me to come in for questioning.
Oh, really?
Who called you first?
Us or them?
Who'd you meet first, us or them?
Would you two stop it?
Miss, we have reason to believe you lied to us when you told us that you worked on the clinical trial alone.
Which, if true, could land you an obstruction charge.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I was trying to protect my partner, Ben.
Protect him from what?
Desiree was Ben's girlfriend.
He was supplying her with fertility pills under the table because their insurance wouldn't cover the thousands of dollars in treatments.
Wait.
They were trying to have a baby?
But they weren't even married.
Gus, get with the times.
It's 2008.
It's 2010.
Nice try.
That would mean we're at war with the machines.
How much did you know about this Ben?
Ben Stephens.
He's not a lawbreaker, he's a very decent guy.
He was only trying to be a good boyfriend.
I lied to keep him out of trouble.
But I certainly don't think he's capable of something like this.
Neither do we.
Guster, would you care to get a cup of coffee, maybe take a little break?
Sure thing.
Yeah, Jules, aren't we due for a break?
How would you feel about a little heavy petting?
Just a little over the clothes, third base action?
Ew.
Maybe get some coffee?
Sure.
Great.
Carlton, what are you doing?
Me?
What are you doing?
You pinned me in.
This is my and Guster's lead.
No, it's my and Shawn's lead.
You should leave.
What are you smoking?
I am head detective.
All leads go through me.
Right.
Like I haven't heard that one before.
I know your tricks.
O'Hara, I am ordering you to get back in that vehicle and drive away.
That's going to be tricky, Lassie.
Give me those!
Oh, nice senior officiating there, Carlton.
Nice.
Shut it!
Ooh.
You guys are letting your lead get away.
Ha!
You just let your lead slip through your fingers.
Will someone explain to me how the four of you let him get away?
Someone else.
We were about to question the suspect when we got sidetracked by a disagreement.
Disagreement?
Well, your little disagreement has led to a state-wide manhunt.
He likes to use your own words against you.
Look, this reflects poorly on me too, and I'd like to keep my job, at least till the end of the month.
Now I want the four of you to get your acts together and find him!
You can't yell at me.
You're just a consultant.
Oh, yeah?
I know what happened to your neighbor's squirrels.
Carry on.
Guster.
Go.
I take my job very seriously, Guster, and I don't like being reprimanded.
All right, we've got to figure out where Ben fled to.
All we have to go on is that he was last spotted heading west on Highway 101.
What the hell are you doing?
It helped you clear your head last time.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Just follow my lead.
Did you notice anything when we were at Ben's house?
No.
It all happened too fast.
The first thing I know we were arguing, next thing I know he was crashing through the garage.
Wait!
The DMV report that came out today, it said that the car that Desiree's body was found in belonged to Ben.
Right.
They shared it.
They were living in sin and driving in sin.
So whose car did Ben crash through the garage in?
Good question.
Maybe a loaner.
Eh No.
Rental.
We should have McNab check all the local rental companies.
Nice.
What?
I got to tell you, I can't believe this stuff actually works, even though I look like a total moron doing it.
Oh, crap.
Look at that.
Christmas came early.
So that's what the two of you have been doing together, tap dancing?
Okay, the truth is Lassiter happens to be in my tap class.
You've been taking tap classes together.
How sweet.
What's next, singing into hairbrushes?
Beachside Pilates?
Quick, Jules, chime in while I think of more zingers.
What's next, bridge?
Yeah, bridge?
What?
Thanks for killing the bit.
Tap happens to be something we both enjoy.
While you two were sneaking around and spying on people We have a new lead.
You're finishing each other's sentences now?
Well, we have a lead, too.
Well, technically ours is more of a hunch Hamburger!
Shawn, why in the world would I have been about to say "hamburger"?
Let's roll, Guster.
That doesn't even make any sense.
I just heard you make an "H" sound.
So you go to "hamburger"?
So we have to figure out how Ben is involved, but I don't think they're going to be cooperative seeing that we don't have a warrant.
Jules, don't be Canada.
I'll handle this.
Hello.
Hello, how can I help you?
I would like to sell my body to science.
Well, I'd like to make the first bid.
Is this a silent auction?
What?
She started it.
Oh, actually, we would like to sign up to be human guinea pigs for money.
Our current volunteer study only pays 20 bucks.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry.
Women only.
She'll do it.
What?
Don't act like you can't use 20 bucks.
I've seen your place.
Well, if you're interested, you'll have to sign the consent forms.
You'll be put under anesthesia, and there's a chance the hormones may make your feet grow.
She's interested.
What are you doing?
What is anyone doing in the grand scheme of things?
Stop.
Your negativity is Is clogging up my psychic signals.
Would you mind keeping her busy while I attempt to unclog them?
And how am I supposed to do that?
Gus would turn into Smooth Gus and try to pick her up.
I am not hitting on a girl.
Why?
Does that scare you?
Or does that not scare you?
And does that scare you?
Shawn, for all we know, this girl could be dangerous.
What?
You better make sure of that before you enter into a relationship with her 'cause she probably won't change.
Right this way.
I'll be back to get your information.
I'll be right here.
Sure.
Okay.
All right, put the time of death down as sometime yesterday on the 12th.
So, Shawn Hey!
It turns out I am taking all of the medications that Tonya here says disqualifies somebody from being a part of the study.
That's No, bummer.
Oh, well, we tried.
I guess we should roll.
Mmm.
And if they ever discover a drug here that makes me strong as an ox, but only when I'm fighting another ox, you let me know.
I will.
All right.
We are going to nail this guy, Guster.
Are you sure Ben's guilty?
Okay.
Here's the rental agreement.
Mr. Stephens' car was due back yesterday and we haven't heard from him.
Do you think he stole it?
I'd say your chances of seeing that vehicle again are about as good as your chances of turning this job into a viable career.
Hey, this antitheft tracking device, is that a LoJack?
Yeah.
We're going to need that tracking ID.
We've got clear motive.
All right, they've been together for a while.
She's been pressuring him, putting the squeeze on him to have kids.
They're common law husband and wife.
She'd get half of everything if he left her.
That's not an option, so he killed her.
I don't know, Lassiter.
Who helps his girlfriend obtain fertility pills if he's not planning on being with her?
This doesn't feel like murder.
Guster, you've got to grow up.
People have sex and they kill each other.
That's the real world, not some magical feelings place.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Let's go get a warrant.
We're going to eat first, right?
No, we'll eat on the way.
I've got an ashtray full of sunflower seeds.
We're so sorry for your loss, Miss Blake.
I know this must be very difficult for you, so we won't take up a lot of your time.
I wish I could be of more help, but I don't know where Ben is.
Believe me, if I knew, I would tell you.
Was there animosity between the two of you?
He was a cheating bastard.
Desiree found out and they had this huge fight right before she disappeared.
I wonder what she did to make him cheat.
Shawn!
What?
What are you doing?
You will thank me later.
Mrs. Blake, I am sensing that Ben felt great remorse for his actions, tried to reach out to you personally.
You mean the flowers he kept sending?
As always, too little, too late.
I never trusted that man.
When did you last see Ben?
Right after they found Desiree's body.
He came by to offer condolences.
I promptly kicked him out.
I'm not so sure he's not the reason she's dead.
Well, we have taken up enough of your time, Miss Blake.
Thank you.
We're just going to Shawn.
Let's go.
Ben's looking more and more guilty the more we learn about him.
I don't know, Jules.
What kind of person kills someone's daughter and then sends her flowers the next day?
A crafty killer, that's who.
We need to go back to the station and start putting these pieces together.
The station?
Can't we do this over a Jamba Juice?
My graph paper and colored pencils are at the station so that we can chart what we know and extrapolate what we don't.
What was that word?
Extrapolate.
Doesn't sound very fun at all.
Whoever said work was supposed to be fun?
Ron Jeremy, for starters.
Tell you what, you go back to the office and put all that boring stuff together that I already forgot what it was.
And I'll see you there in half an hour.
Okay.
Half an hour.
Sweet.
Good work, Gus.
Found Ben.
Shawn, what are you doing here?
Dude, I know you're not psychic.
Sorry, buddy.
It's hard to keep track of who knows what.
I broke away from Juliet, tracked you on your little thingy.
How'd you find him?
Lassiter used the LoJack tracking system on this car.
I saw the location, snuck away while Lassiter was working on the warrant.
Figured you guys were close.
And like me, you broke away because you thought Ben was innocent.
Dude, you're doing it again.
Am I?
It's ridiculous.
Is that why you broke away from Juliet?
Yep.
Needed to check it out for myself.
Hmm.
Well, since we're both here, we might as well do it together.
Sure, whatever.
Mmm-hmm.
Ben!
No, wait!
No!
Ben, we don't Wait!
Whatever the police think I did, I didn't do it.
I'm a psychic with the police department.
This is my partner, Santonio Holmes.
We don't think you did it either.
Really?
Really.
You were more distraught than anyone to hear that Desiree was dead.
Of course I was.
Just thinking about it makes me sick.
I want to find the person who did this more than anything.
I've loved Desiree, like, forever.
We've been living together since we graduated.
When did you graduate?
Lassiter's theory that he killed Desiree to protect his money doesn't make sense.
They weren't common law husband and wife.
Those rights don't kick in until a couple has been together for seven years.
They moved in together in 2005, which was only three years ago.
Five.
I should start carrying a pocket calendar.
Ben, why did you run from the cops?
Desiree's mom, she practically accused me of causing Desiree's death.
I thought she was the one who called the cops on me, so I panicked.
Ben, listen to me, but also hear me, you didn't do yourself any favors by hiding, okay?
Now, I can convince the cops that you're innocent, but only if you trust us.
And you're sure I'll do the touching.
You're sure they'll believe I'm innocent?
I can guarantee it.
Freeze, you murderous dirtbag!
Ish.
I can guarantee it-ish.
Guys, please help me out here.
Hang in there, Ben.
Shawn, Santonio, can I at least get my phone call?
All right, so what if it wasn't a common law marriage?
If he was innocent, he wouldn't have run from the police.
I have a very strong hunch that he's not our killer.
We don't deal in hunches.
We?
I'm sorry, Shawn, but it's over.
I understand.
It was fun while it lasted.
No, it wasn't.
We made a great team.
No, we didn't.
It was a disaster.
Partners don't lie to one another, and partners don't run off mid-investigation, and partners do not go through my purse, find my phone and text photos of my dog to every guy in my address book with the caption, "This is you".
Partners support each other's theories.
We never support each other.
Yeah, we're constantly lying and running.
I miss that.
Me too.
What?
We're still hired on this case, Gus.
Let's get to work.
But first, can we get something to eat?
I'm kind of hungry.
All I've had all day are sunflower seeds.
Are you kidding me?
I haven't eaten in almost two hours.
Hamburgers.
And then we try to free Ben.
And then, Japadogs.
What?
Well, one thing's for sure from all this, it's nice to have you back.
Thanks.
I'm sorry you got stuck with an extra caseload while I was gone.
That's okay.
Besides, it's your extra caseload now.
It's good to be back.
Woodrow, my good man.
Shawn.
Always nice to see you walk through that door.
Well, let's hope you never see me rolled in on a gurney.
Let's.
Although I'd be honored to saw through your chest and remove your good-natured heart from its cavity.
I'm touched.
Woody, in your professional opinion, how do I die?
Murder.
Gangland-style execution.
We never find your head.
It's a shame.
You slip in a tub.
We need you to tell us everything you can about the death of this here Desiree Blake.
Cause of death in our victim Oh.
is confirmed to be drowning, evidenced by the presence of fluid in the lungs.
What about this mark on her ankle there?
Yeah.
Interesting, isn't it?
Almost looks like freezer burn.
Freezer burn?
How would she get freezer burn in 70-degree water?
Better question is why would a drowning victim show no signs of struggle?
What do you mean?
Well, there's no bruising on the body, or cuts, or any kind of struggle.
Hey, it's Ben's lab partner.
When Ben called and said that he'd been arrested, I rushed right over.
There's no way that he did this.
We don't think so either.
Yeah, but we need proof.
You know, Gus and I discovered something pretty interesting.
Did you two know that when a tech enters Ben's lab, they have to swipe a security card to gain entrance?
Gee, Gus, I wish there was some kind of record of exactly what time he entered and exited on the day of the murder.
Some kind of log.
Or a registry.
Ledger.
Ducket.
Docket.
I've heard I haven't.
Hey, what is that behind your ear?
Will you look at that?
It's the entrance record.
Oh, according to this, Ben was working at the time of the murder.
What?
Mmm.
There's no way he could have killed Desiree.
And now we revel.
Alien-style.
Congratulations.
But you two are forgetting something.
What's that, Officer Dad?
Part-time Officer Dad.
There's still a killer out there.
Get to work.
Mmm.
All right, what do we know about this case?
One, there's a woman who's dead.
Two, Ben didn't kill her.
Three.
These Japadogs are delicious.
I hear that.
You got to give it to the Japanese.
And not just because they invented the Chinese.
You know, I almost took Lassiter to the Japadog cart once, but I felt like I was cheating.
Oh, that's so sweet, buddy.
Mmm.
He was a cheating bastard.
Desiree found out and they had this huge fight right before she disappeared.
Wait a minute.
Ben cheated on Desiree.
Yes, he did.
We never figured out with who.
He didn't say.
She would have motive to kill Desiree.
Bingo.
We got to get that out of Ben.
How come you're allowed to say "bingo," but I'm not?
The same reason you're not allowed to say "True dat".
"True that"?
Exactly.
Buzz, what's going on, man?
They just pulled a dead surfer out of the water.
Dead Ben.
Oh, no.
Ben!
He's dead, Shawn.
Oh, man.
Once again, no sign of struggle.
Fluid in the lungs.
If this happened once, I wouldn't think as much of it, but twice in one week with two victims who knew each other?
That's more than suspicious.
What would be really awesome is if it happened a third time.
You're saying that Ben and Desiree both drowned, but neither of them actually died in water.
How is that possible?
They were dry drowned.
Oh, come on, Gus, now you're just putting words next to other words that sound like things we're talking about.
No.
Actually, he's right.
Dry drowning can give all the appearances of actual drowning, but it'd have to be caused by something like a methane gas leak or an overdose of anesthesia.
If you're interested, you'll have to sign the consent forms.
You'll be put under anesthesia.
Gus, we got to get back to the lab.
You.
All right, we came down here like you asked.
Now what?
Let's be honest, we need you and you need us.
Let us all work together.
Watch it and feel it.
I refuse to watch, and I'm sure as hell not going to feel it.
Feel what, Shawn?
We're about to get ourselves a confession.
Tonya, got bad news.
These are cops.
This is Dion Richmond.
No, I'm not.
I'm a psychic.
I see things and I feel things.
Do you want to feel what you see?
I can't lose with this girl.
Have you no shame?
I'm not here to play twist and pull.
Not with a cold-blooded killer.
You're the one that had an affair with Ben.
Don't deny it.
Guilty as charged.
Boom shaka!
That's got to be a new record.
What?
Cuff her, Lassie.
What?
It's not like he croaked while we were doing it.
You wanted Ben all for yourself.
No, I didn't.
We hooked up once and he totally freaked out.
He loved his girl.
Whatever.
The beat goes on.
Not Ben's.
Likely story.
You had access to the anesthesia that dry drowned him.
I'm a part-time assistant.
I mean, do you think they actually let me near that stuff?
My security badge gets me in and out of the front door and into the bathroom.
I don't get anywhere near the actual experiments.
You'd have to go to DeVry or something for that.
Yes.
Interesting indeed.
Almost looks like freezer burn.
I'm calling an audible.
I'm sensing something very strong.
I'm getting a strong, jealous, spiteful spirit vibe here.
Right here.
It's strong here, but mostly here.
Yes.
You.
Lillian.
You were jealous of Ben and Desiree's relationship.
That's ridiculous.
Miss, excuse me, we'll get to you in a second.
Spencer, what's the deal, am I cuffing Charlotte the Harlot or what?
No.
Sorry.
You and I are back on dirty.
Lillian killed Desiree Blake because she wanted Ben all for herself.
That's crazy.
Maybe it isn't.
In your statement to us, you did refer to Ben as a great boyfriend, and you showed up to get him out of jail before we'd even finished processing him.
Come on.
Of course you fell for him.
He was your partner, he shared his problems with you, he confided in you.
He trusted you.
But Ben never referred to her as anything other than a co-worker.
I mean, come on, it's obvious why he'd go for that one, she's easy.
I was more than a co-worker.
I cared for him.
Everyone knew that Ben and Desiree were getting married.
Ben made a mistake and cheated on Desiree.
She moved out and you saw that as your opportunity.
Hey, who are you calling a mistake?
Isn't it obvious?
How did I miss this?
What is he doing?
It gives him clarity.
Lassie, I don't think we have time to give the Savion Glover treatment.
Even after Ben cheated, he still pined for Desiree.
He wanted her back, and you realized you would have to get rid of her for good, so you brought her to this lab and gave her a high dose of anesthesia that caused her to dry drown.
I taught him that.
Trust us, we know.
Then you just had to get rid of the body.
So you put Desiree behind the wheel of her car, and you drove it into the lake, weighing down the accelerator with one of those big blocks of frozen water that you use for freezing lab samples.
Dry ice is not frozen water.
It's carbon dioxide.
They do share the same principle in terms of Not now.
I can't do this with you now.
The point is, the evidence melted.
Very clever.
And all you had to do was be there for Ben, and he would fall for you like you had already fallen for him.
Except he didn't feel the same way about you.
I want to find the person who did this more than anything.
You were so delusional, you thought he would be touched by your murderous act.
Of course, he was not because you are a crazy dry drowner.
And in the heat of the moment, it was either you or him.
And you chose you.
Nice, Lassie.
Way to tap your way back to the party.
A second review of the body will trace the anesthesia used to kill them back to your lab.
He should have been with me.
This is all her fault.
Hands behind your back, please.
Well played, Shawn.
Well played, everybody.
Way to roll with the punches.
You just never know which way it's going to come and go, psychically speaking.
Thank you for agreeing to meet me.
Sure.
Let's hope this goes better than the last couple of days.
Yes.
Let's.
Not that they were that bad.
They were horrific.
Wow.
You all right?
Okay.
All right.
Again.
Again from the top.
That's my partner up there!
My boy!
The black guy's my partner!
They're both black.
I know who the Westside Rapist is.
And that's my partner.
Kids, come on, freestyle!
One, two, three, four!

{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
It's the Highway Department's problem, Jerry, not mine.
I'm going to have to call you back.
All right, what are you three doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be in school?
Yeah, well, we came to see that UFO you cleared from that field this morning.
You mean the weather balloon.
They got to him.
Who got to me, Dennis?
The secret government agency in charge of extraterrestrial cover-ups.
How much are they paying you?
All right, that's enough, guys.
Back to school, now.
Do you think this is a game, Mr. Spencer?
I assure you it's not.
Inside that grounded Cassiopeian death pod, sits an army of Glornokian mercenaries intent on colonizing our planet and propagating their evil species.
After they probe us.
We should go, he's packing.
There are no such things as UFOs, Shawn.
Details are still coming in from So, the plaintiff is entitled to compensatory and punitive damages per article 35-A, section J, which Oh, Jesus!
Toby!
Hey, Roy.
You okay?
Just came by to drop off the Patterson file and some refills.
Oh, yeah, right.
Listen, did you notice any commotion a moment ago?
No.
No.
What kind of commotion are we talking about?
Toby!
Toby!
Toby, where are you going?
Toby, no!
Aren't you forgetting something?
No.
Hey!
Hey!
Chief said we were supposed to let him drive around with us, get to know our process, we are not currently driving.
You need to stop taking your frustration with Shawn out on Henry.
Better him than the neighbor's cat.
Ow!
I could have suffocated in there.
Please.
I cracked the window.
I'm glad that Shawn peanut-buttered your phone the other day.
I knew that was him.
Guys!
I still have Jif in my ear.
Mr. Kessler, I am Detective O'Hara and this is Detective Lassiter, and this is Henry Spencer who helps us coordinate our investigations.
So, sir, I understand you witnessed a kidnapping last night.
I'd say it was more of an abduction.
Do you have any idea who the perpetrator was?
Yes.
An extraterrestrial.
How come the crazies never live close by?
Listen, I know it sounds nuts, but I'm telling you, I saw it with my own eyes!
An alien came down and snatched a young lawyer that works at my firm.
Toby Shore.
Mr. Kessler, no offense, but I think you're going to have a hard time finding anyone to believe a story like that.
Was he tall and scaly or short with a huge lollipop head?
Tall, I think.
Reptilian.
Probably hostile.
All right people, we're going to need a Speak & Spell and seven pounds of mashed potatoes.
Enough.
Mr. Kessler, if your co-worker doesn't show up in the next eight hours, feel free to file a missing persons report.
Until then, stop wasting our time.
You owe me a new phone.
You have a very nice home.
This UFO, was it more like a bright sphere or two soup bowls glued together?
Ah, no it was a sphere, definitely.
What are you guys?
Are you UFO chasers?
Nothing as ridiculous as that.
We're psychic detectives.
And we can help you get to the bottom of what happened last night.
Oh, fantastic.
You're hired.
Shawn, may I have a word?
I really don't think you should take this case.
Well, I don't think you should be dropping the dime on my peanut-butter pranks.
Look, we all know there's 0% chance that you don't end up believing this kook.
How do you figure that?
Because you want to believe him, Shawn.
Just like you wanted to believe it wasn't a weather balloon when you were a kid, and you wanted to believe that it was aliens that abducted Joe Piscopo.
That remains my theory until someone can pinpoint the man's whereabouts.
Don't worry, Mr. Spencer.
I promise you, we will not let our interest in UFOs affect our judgment.
Good.
Because you run around town telling everybody that an alien did this, you're going to look like a couple of nut jobs.
Shawn, I can't hire nut jobs.
Dad, would you relax, please?
Obviously, we don't think aliens are responsible.
Good.
Hold your horses!
Because if aliens did do this, there'd be signs of electrical disruptions.
Exactly.
What else would we see, Gus?
Well, there most definitely would be a visible ground disturbance.
Right.
So, where do you guys want to start?
How about your terrace?
Whoa.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end All those people who gave you, Dennis and I flack for believing in aliens in school, Jeff Garrett and that female Russian exchange student who stole my wallet, they're going to eat their words when this goes public.
I've got news, Gus.
Toby Shore was not abducted by an alien.
What?
But what about the lights and grass and stuff?
Look, it's time we learned it's never the crazy suspects.
It wasn't a mummy, it wasn't the devil, it wasn't even Bigfoot.
Bigfoot?
When did we suspect Bigfoot?
Missing school bus case.
I mean, there were bite marks in the cushion.
The driver's seat was pushed back six feet.
Right.
Okay, okay.
You're probably right that it's not an alien, but why don't we keep investigating just to be sure?
Because my dad actually makes a valid point.
It's going to be hard to get any objective work done when we're both secretly hoping that it's an alien.
So we can rub it in Jeff Garrett's face.
No, Gus, we have to let that go.
So what are you saying, that we pass on a case?
No.
Your $1,200 balance on your JCPenney card is not going to pay for itself.
We just have to acknowledge our mutual tendency to think unreasonably about this topic and police ourselves accordingly.
How?
All right.
If one of us starts leaning towards the alien theory, other one gets to flick him in the ear.
That's an incredibly stupid idea.
You have exactly three seconds to beat it.
Three, two, one.
Now how was that fair?
Now, let's find out what, if anything, happened here last night.
Roy?
May I call you Phil?
I'd rather you didn't.
Fair enough.
How many beers did you have last night?
Just one.
Oh, come on, what?
Are you implying that I beer goggled an alien abduction?
Happened to Gus last New Year's.
I hit the White Zin hard.
I promise you, I was sober as a judge.
Let me ask you this, if Toby wasn't abducted last night, what happened to him?
Maybe he left when you weren't looking.
His car is still in the driveway.
And listen to this, when I went out to move it this morning, it wouldn't start.
The car's brand new.
Really?
You know, cars often lose battery power when they come in contact with UFOs.
Ow!
Thank you.
Have you tried calling him?
Yeah, about 50 times.
It just goes straight to voicemail.
Maybe he's out of range.
Ah!
What the hell was that for?
You were implying he's in space.
No, I wasn't.
Yes, you were.
Where are you going?
Mr. Kessler, maybe we should talk to your neighbors to see if they saw anything.
Good luck with that.
Nearest one's about half a mile away.
Listen, you got to believe me.
I was just sitting at the desk last night, and the whole house started to shake.
And then there were these lights and then this I was hearing this weird sound.
It sounded like No, it sounded nothing like that.
Oh, really?
I'm sorry.
I was actually trying to make this sound.
That's it.
That's it.
That's the sound.
You weren't even close.
You know I struggle with tone deafness.
Why would you Now, do you believe me?
Before we answer that question, we'll need to consult an expert.
Hi, we're looking for Dennis Gogolack.
Shawn?
Gus?
Dennis?
No.
Get the hell out of here.
I don't believe it!
What an awesome surprise.
What are you guys doing?
It's been forever.
Wow.
We didn't even recognize you now that you're What?
Not fat and nerdy?
It's okay.
It's the truth.
I credit my personal trainer and Lasiks.
Losing the wizard's cloak also helped.
Come on.
Get inside here.
Wow.
That's interesting.
Yeah, my wife's into stuff that dangles.
Looks like the software business has been good to you, Dennis.
Very good.
Oh, hey, guys.
I'm Dennis' wife, Molly.
That was the creepiest "very" that I've ever heard.
Hey.
Hey, babe.
Babe, this is Shawn and Gus.
These are two good friends of mine from back in grade school, and now they're psychic detectives.
How cool is that?
Really cool.
Nice meeting you guys.
Why didn't you tell me that we were having friends over, Denny?
Actually, we didn't give Denny much of a heads-up.
Here's the thing.
We're investigating a case that may have involved an alien abduction.
And being that your husband is one of the foremost experts on the topic I'm sorry, guys.
I'm afraid I'm not much of an expert anymore.
It's been 20 years since I was into that stuff.
Oh, well, that's me Same here, bro.
Beer.
Yeah, Denny's a total jock.
Guilty.
I'm guilty as charged.
Wow.
Oh, good, you did, like, a little Explosion.
You guys don't have to take off yet, we've got some catching up to do.
Ah, actually, we're under a bit of a time crunch.
Ah, let me just give you a quick tour of the place.
Oh, Denny, I was actually going to go hang with the girls, though.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
Nice meeting you guys.
Very nice.
Stop it.
Come on.
Come check out my office.
All right.
I gotta say, Dennis, I'm surprised that you of all people outgrew the whole nerd thing.
I mean, come on, you were a class three Dungeon Master with your own set of custom 12-sided dice.
Let's go.
What?
Oh, my You are a closet nerd.
Literally.
Dude.
What?
You have a replica of Captain Adama's helmet from the original Battlestar Galactica?
And LeVar Burton's glasses from Star Trek!
Those aren't replicas, gentlemen.
I got those for 15 grand a pop at auction.
I have never been so motivated to make money.
Wait until I show you where the magic happens.
And I mean that literally.
There's another hidden room downstairs where I practice my magic tricks.
Why all the secrecy?
Well, look, when I first met Molly, it was clear she was only into guys' guys, so, you know, that's who I pretended to be.
She ended up buying it.
I guess I've been pretending ever since.
Sounds exhausting.
You have no idea.
Every day is a new challenge.
Whether it's trying to draw blanks during Jeopardy!
Or having to sneak in here every time I want to track some UFO activity or sew a new Renaissance Faire costume.
Excellent stitch work, My Liege.
Thanks, Gus.
The worst is when I'm around Molly's friends' husbands.
I have to say inane stuff like, "Beer me," or "Yeah, I'd totally hit that".
What exactly am I hitting?
Most likely an attractive lady.
Okay, that's horrible.
Is it really worth it, Den?
Have you seen my wife?
Listen, Dennis, we need your opinion on this recording.
Gus is convinced it's a UFO.
Let's hear it.
Based on my research, I'd say that's a voyager pod from the Serpens Dwarf galaxy or bad new age music.
But if you had to choose.
Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.
If you guys can give me the time and location, I could check the sky activity.
I hacked into the National Weather Service's computer a few years back and can pretty much access their radar database whenever I want.
All right.
Well, he lives at 25 Buckskin Drive.
And it happened around Nothing.
Well, what do you know?
Wait a minute.
You better try 10:44 just to be safe.
You got to be kidding me.
What is that?
Ah, Den?
Dennis, you all right there, buddy?
She doesn't even know that you're asthmatic?
No.
And she never will.
All right, Gus, I can't believe that I'm about to say this.
What?
I think Toby got abducted.
So do I. You do?
Yes.
Sweet.
Why are we both covering our ears then?
I don't know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, tell me you're not calling Jeff Garrett.
No.
Roy.
He needs to know that we believe him.
All right, but make sure you tell him to keep it on the QT.
I know.
Right.
I'm standing here just outside the home of prominent local attorney Roy Kessler who's joined me now and has a rather shocking announcement to make.
Mr. Kessler.
Well, last night I witnessed aliens abduct a fellow co-worker.
People are going to think he's nuts.
And I can prove it thanks to the fine investigative work being done by psychic detectives Shawn Spencer and Gurton Buster.
Gurton what?
Oh, my God, I look like k.d. lang.
Yes, Dad, we'll be right there.
Look, before you go off on us, answer me this question, do you think that picture of me on the news makes me look like I should be singing Constant Craving?
Shawn, what did I tell you about taking this case?
Mr. Spencer, we have hard evidence on this one.
Not to mention the fact that Roy Kessler is a respected attorney, not some crazy conspiracy theorist.
Are you kidding?
That's exactly what he is.
Shawn, have you ever heard of Budding Textiles?
That's the company that had to fork out millions for the chemical spill.
Uh-huh, it got hundreds of people sick.
And do you know who thinks it was done on purpose?
Erin Brockovich!
Roy Kessler.
He's preparing a lawsuit against them.
We didn't know that.
Yeah, I suppose you also didn't know he's being heavily medicated for anxiety.
He misses a dose and he's prone to psychotic episodes.
Last year, he claims to have seen a panda in his company's kitchen.
That's not crazy at all.
Pandas are big eaters.
Ten years ago, Kessler claimed, you got it, he saw a UFO while on vacation.
Saucer or sphere?
You know, you two wouldn't have missed this kind of stuff if you hadn't been so blinded by your childish interests.
Okay, first of all, the only thing we were blinded by is Science!
That never gets old.
Nope.
And tell me this, if Toby wasn't abducted, where the hell is he?
Right in there.
He took a cab to his parents' house that night after his car wouldn't start.
Turned off his phone, and he slept in.
Nice going, man.
Ow!
Ow!
Stop it!
I remember him muttering all this stuff about lights and ships, and I thought it was just Roy being Roy.
And then I turned on the TV today and heard his insane theory.
I wouldn't call it insane.
Would you let it go?
I tried everything I could to get him to take his meds.
I would even pick them up at the pharmacy for him and bring them to him directly.
Man, he's going to hear it at the office on Monday.
Actually, your firm just suspended him until he completes a month's stay at a mental health facility.
Wow.
Who's going to get all his cases?
We're available.
Isn't that right, Mr. Spencer?
Gus here is a whiz at LegalZoom.
My cousin has a personal injury law firm called Accidentes.
Heard of it?
No, I haven't.
You will.
You will.
Good work, people.
Papa bear.
You know what, Gus?
I really don't appreciate being snickered at.
Never again are we investigating something related to one of our childhood obsessions.
But what if it's a Pop Rocks murder?
That is the exception.
Excuse me, Spencer, quick question, how does it feel to be so wrong that you are now a walking joke?
Just like you, minus the kind boots and the soft eyes.
Wow.
This is really a big moment for me.
I may even do a little dance.
Oh, yes, I will.
No, he doesn't All right, that's it, Gus.
We are going to find out what really happened, and we are going to clear our good names.
Let me ask you something, if you were up and coming at a law firm, and you were abducted by aliens Because that happens.
Would you tell anyone?
I know I wouldn't because they would think I was nuts.
Like I do right now.
That dude was not abducted, Gus.
Okay, well, you have three seconds to come up with a better theory to explain all this weirdness.
All right.
Three, two, one.
That's my trick.
How do you explain the radar, the recording, the indentation on the lawn?
Let me tell you, it was a plane on the radar, someone cranking Yanni on the recorder, and the indentation could have been a million things.
Shawn, how do you explain the three strange markings on Toby's arm?
You saw those?
Of course, I did, and I didn't have to do this.
Are you mocking my "It's a clue" face?
Yep.
Do it again.
I don't look like that.
Yes, you do.
You're a bastard.
Shawn, you know that abductees often have strange markings on their skin.
So do I when I don't use enough sunscreen.
Now, come here.
Stand still and let me flick your ear.
He was abducted, Shawn.
Was not.
Yes, he was.
No, he wasn't.
Yes, he was.
Was not.
Wasn't.
Yes, he was.
Wasn't infinity!
If you're going to act like a child about this, then we're going to have to bring in a third party to settle this disagreement.
Fine.
Who?
He was definitely abducted.
The markings combined with the other details have me convinced.
Why would I tag in a guy with a custom-made Ewok costume?
Hey, what's the name of that law firm he works at?
Wilcox, Kessler and something.
Why?
What are you doing?
Getting his work address so you can spy on this guy.
Look, fellas, you have to see if he's exhibiting the other telltale abduction signs.
You know this.
Paranoia, the compulsion to travel to unknown areas.
Suicidal tendencies.
Spewing nonsense with authority.
Oh, wait, that's you guys.
You mock but I'm still waiting on a better theory from you.
All right, it was Toby.
Why did he just tilt his head and squint?
It's his "I got a clue" face.
Think about it, Gus, Toby knew he stood to inherit all of Roy's cases if he could just get him out of the way.
So he arranged for him to have one of his psychotic episodes.
How?
I would even pick the meds up from the pharmacy and bring them to him directly.
Tampering with his meds.
And you know what?
It worked like a charm.
Roy goes nuts, the next day, Toby's a major player at the firm.
Let's go.
Where are we going?
Well, we're going to take Dennis' advice, do a little spying on our boy.
What can I do?
Lend us some sweet disguises.
Fellas, just tell me what you need.
I have never felt cooler.
You've never looked cooler.
Dennis is going to have to pry this helmet off my cold dead noggin.
There's Toby.
Dude, he's sweating and shaking.
Have you been seeing clues this whole time?
Paranoia is one of the telltale signs of an abduction.
It's also the sign of a guy with a guilty conscience.
Stop saying stupid things.
You're a disgrace to those glasses.
He's bolting, Gus!
He's wandering into unknown areas.
This helmet is not made for running!
I should have borrowed Charlton Heston's scarf from Soylent Green!
I can't see out these glasses, Shawn!
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
We lost him!
Son of a Hello?
Is this Shawn Spencer?
Toby?
You got to help me.
They're following me.
Whoa, whoa, calm down, man.
Who's following you?
I don't know.
I think it's the black dude from Star Trek and some white guy in a ridiculous helmet.
Which is your opinion.
Where are you?
Listen to me.
Roy Kessler was telling the truth.
I told you.
I told you.
I told you.
Okay, you need to come meet us.
I can't.
It's too dangerous.
Meet me in an hour in front of the Lansdowne Hotel.
Lansdowne.
Got it.
Dude, did you just break Dennis' helmet?
Well, it clearly wasn't made for running, Gus.
Was that scarf worth going back to Dennis'?
Is Soylent Green people?
Now let's go get this confession out of Toby.
You mean admission that he was abducted.
Let's start with the non-bat-crap angle, shall we?
Shawn, you heard him say Kessler was telling the truth.
Gus, you really putting me in a tough spot here, man.
You don't think I want to be the guy riffing on how aliens abducted Toby, and what they did to him when they brought him on board the mother ship?
They probed him and placed an embryo in his stomach that's going to hatch out his eardrum in 12 days.
I can't do it.
Someone has to hold the sanity bag in this partnership and, quite frankly, I miss the days when it used to be you.
Shawn, he's exhibiting all the telltale signs.
Paranoia, check.
Nervousness, check.
Ah!
Oh, my gosh.
Suicidal tendencies.
Check.
Hey, Jules, what's the word?
We just found out that Toby wired all of the money from his bank account, about 500 grand, to a charity an hour before his death.
We haven't found a note yet, but it's looking like suicide.
I don't know about that.
You think it's strange that a junior lawyer has that kind of account balance?
Not to mention the fact he was Roy Kessler's former co-worker?
No, my senses are telling me there is definitely more to this Much more.
Subtle.
Let me guess, you think the Loch Ness monster did it.
All right, what are you two doing here?
Came to get going on the Toby Shore case.
Why?
You're not being hired on it.
Surely you can't be serious.
Son, I warned you, I can't stick my neck out for two guys who are currently viewed as the village idiots.
Village idiots?
Who here thinks that?
Dirty Larry?
Jules?
Sorry.
Gus and I might be a lot of things Handsome.
Chiseled.
Intelligent.
Urbane.
Whatever that means.
But we are not idiots.
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.
My bad.
That's all me.
But come on, who needs a fan this big?
Seriously.
Leave now.
Fine.
Fine.
We're out.
All right.
Smooth move.
Come on, man, give a brother some credit.
Let's see what we got here.
Nada, recipe for Juliet's weird cleanse.
Preliminary coroner's report.
What does it say?
Apparently, they found a strange object in Toby's stomach.
Embryo.
Come on.
Woodrow!
Hey, boys.
You have got to try these French fries.
They're killer.
We ate.
Thanks.
For the last time.
We need to talk to you about the autopsy you did on Toby Shore.
What about it?
Come on, buddy, we know you're hiding something.
Fine.
I stole his watch.
You did what?
Hmm?
Nothing.
Hey, how about some fried clams?
We want to know what you found in his stomach.
I cannot tell you that.
I will get in trouble.
Really?
More or less trouble than you'd get in for looting corpses?
The object was a flash drive.
Now, when you say flash drive, is that coroner code for an alien embryo that hatches in people's ear?
No.
That's the word "starfish".
This was a legitimate four gigabyte flash drive.
There were I take notes.
Abrasions on his lungs, which implied he swallowed it moments before his death.
Interesting.
What about the markings on his left arm?
That was birthmark.
Ha!
Where is this flash drive now?
I believe it's with Detective Lassiter.
Great.
Thanks, Woody.
You stay creepy.
You know I will.
You know, Spencer, the minute you refused to hire that smarmy fortune-telling kid of yours, you officially made it off my crap list.
Here.
See.
You actually have a crap list?
I like to keep track of people who've wronged me over the years.
You know people like your son, my mother.
Olympia freaking Dukakis.
You disturb me.
Do I?
Welcome back, Henry.
But I got to say, it is really nice to finally be able to do some real police work without worrying about your son interfering.
What the hell?
Can I get somebody from IT over here?
Johnson, come help me out!
I'm not sure how comfortable I am hacking a police computer.
Relax.
It's his personal one.
Which reminds me, check the Internet search history.
All right.
Let's see.
Grenadefancy.
com.
Squirrelassassins.
com.
And That's gross.
That man needs Jesus.
Let's see what's on that flash drive, shall we?
Sorry, Gus, doesn't look like a blueprint for an alien fertility lab.
Shocker.
It's just a bunch of legal documents related to Budding Textiles.
That's that insane case Kessler was working on.
He believed the Budding chemical spill was done on purpose.
That is crazy.
I've got something.
We know.
Damn, I really got to stop doing that.
Denny, where are you?
Quick!
Quick, gotta get out of here!
Go, go, go!
Denny?
Denny?
One minute, babe!
Denny?
Ah!
Ah!
Hey, guys, what's going on in here?
You know, guy stuff.
Steak.
Denny, you can't host a football party from inside your office.
Come on.
Taylor just got a safety.
Sweet.
I'll be right there, babe.
Okay.
Bye, Molly.
What's a safety?
Really?
Look, Dennis, why don't you blow off this party and come with Gus and I?
Where are we going?
Yeah, where are we going?
I'm not entirely sure, but I know it involves a small town and some potential danger.
Oh, wow, that sounds cool.
How much danger?
But I can't, man.
Molly would kill me.
Dennis, you're never going to know what it feels like to be a normal guy as long as you're pretending to be something that you're not.
Trust me, he knows.
Come on.
It's time for you to get out there and experience some real life, non-virtual adventure.
He's right.
It's time to come out of the nerd closet.
I'm sorry, guys, I just can't.
I really like having sex with my wife.
Don't say it.
What's wrong with you, man?
Now's the point where you tell me what the hell we're doing here.
Guess who's now the proud owner of this home?
Along with the 700 similar ones that make up this tiny town?
Shawn, if you say us, I'm going to punch you in the face.
Budding Textiles.
It's the last one they purchased.
Why would Budding want a bunch of crappy houses on poisoned land?
Here's a better question, what is the world's coolest truck doing here?
Looks like a Decepticon.
It's not a Decepticon, Gus.
It's made in Fresno.
Whatever it is, I highly suggest we do not touch it.
Shawn!
Gus, the keys were already in the ignition.
What was I supposed to do?
Not start it.
It's not that easy.
Actually, it is.
All right, you know, when Toby said that Roy Kessler was telling the truth, he didn't mean an abduction, he meant the lawsuit against Budding.
That makes no sense, Shawn.
Why would they intentionally spill chemicals?
To get people to leave.
What?
In all the ridiculous science classes you've taken over the years, did you ever learn about hydrocarbons?
Of course I did.
They're organic compounds found mainly in crude oil.
If there's a high percentage of them in soil does that mean that there's oil underneath?
Not necessarily.
You'd have to check using a machine that sends sonic vibrations into the Earth, which help I think we're in one of those machines.
Why must you always touch stuff, Shawn?
It stopped shaking, Shawn.
Oh.
Gus, I feel like a bobblehead.
You look like an idiot.
Come on.
Try it.
I'm not doing that.
Get it on it.
I don't want to.
It's fun!
Fine.
Dude, you look ridiculous.
But think about it, it all makes sense.
Budding figured out that this town is sitting on a gold mine so what does he do?
He orchestrates a chemical spill to drive everyone away.
That way, he wouldn't have to share any of the profits.
Exactly.
Which I imagine dwarfs the cost of lawsuits and land purchases.
And Kessler was on to all of this.
Which sort of freaks me out.
Why?
Because it makes me wonder what else he was telling the truth about.
I don't want to get probed, Gus!
What are you worried about?
You're the one who's less exotic!
Wait!
Get in here.
Well, boys, start talking.
About what exactly?
How about a story?
Would you like to hear a story?
Please.
I always enjoy a good one.
All right, once upon there was this greedy CEO think, uh, what, Stephen Lang?
Esque.
Anyway, he wanted to kill this lawyer because the lawyer was on the verge of ruining his evil master plan, but he couldn't, because the lawyer had prepared a legitimate case against him.
Hot start.
Please continue.
He figured out that if he could make the lawyer look whacko, the case would be dismissed as some nutty conspiracy theory, but how?
Ten years ago, Kessler claimed to have seen, you got it, a UFO.
Light bulb.
He would convince the lawyer he'd witnessed an abduction.
See, he already had this fancy 'copter so all he had to do was add some extra lighting, pump some Enya b-sides through the sound system and then figure out how to trip the electricity.
He most likely used an EMP device.
What is that, a pregnancy test?
No.
Doesn't make any sense, Gus.
Would you just let me tell the story?
EMP not EPT.
It produces an electrical pulse.
Okay, you know what?
There is a fine line between being knowledgeable and arrogant.
Enough.
I'm on the edge of my seat here.
Right.
Well, it all worked like a charm with one exception.
See, the young lawyer that he paid 500 Gs to set up this guy, had a change of heart once he came across the dismissed case file.
But it was still just a minor mishap for our CEO because he is a problem solver.
I like his style.
Yeah?
And he was in the clear until he came across two young go-getters and they were onto everything.
Who he then proceeded to let go because they promised not to tell a soul.
Swore.
They swore because that's stronger than a promise.
That's not going to happen.
It's It's not?
What?
And to think I only picked you up for trespassing.
Whoops.
Lead them out back.
Don't worry.
I texted my dad.
Cops will be here any minute.
Who is it?
Messenger service.
Hey, I have a delivery for you to sign.
Dennis?
What's he doing here?
I don't know.
Let's see some ID.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Oh!
And he spent the rest of his miserable life in jail.
The end.
My lip.
Dude, how did you find us?
I cloned Shawn's cell phone earlier.
I think I did some real damage to my premolars.
It's okay, Dennis, you looked like a badass until you clocked yourself in the face.
You needed this, man!
Hands in the air!
You, hands in the air!
Put those down!
Put them down!
Lassie!
Don't do it!
Wait!
Wait!
Put it down now!
No, put the gun down!
He didn't need that.
Yeah, I see it now.
Right?
I look like I just finished a set at Lilith Fair.
Hey, Lassie.
All right, let me have it.
No.
I have other things to do with my time than gloat about being a hero.
And the fact that you unnecessarily caused one of our friends to whizz himself.
I'm actually here for some police advice.
Really?
No.
It's boogie time.
Is there ever a high road between you guys?
Shawn, Gus.
Jerks.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't ignore-your-son's-urgent-text man.
It's a good thing you told Juliet and she took it seriously.
Well, I thought you guys were still goofing around.
Your credibility hasn't been too high of late.
That's no excuse.
You can make it up to us by approving these expenses.
What?
$7,000 in dental work for Dennis Gogolack?
And a new pair of underpants.
Twenty-two packs of Razzles?
Season tickets to the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA?
Are you guys serious about this stuff?
As a Rebecca Lobo set shot.
Class.
All right, look, I'll think about it.
In the meantime, Chief Vick wants you to take a look at this counterfeit thing.
Oh, look at that.
Now you want us.
Well, guess what, it's going to cost you.
How much?
Two grand.
Sorry, heroes don't work for less than two large.
Fine.
Sweet.
Now can we see you make it official?
Yeah, just put it right in the old bippity, boppity Hmm-mmm.
What Thanks, Dad.
We'll start tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Why not right now?
Because we've got to visit some friends.
My god, Shawn, you look like Billie Jean King.
Detonate the Pillar of Autumn.
I know how to play.
I got to say, I can't thank you enough for clearing my good name.
I don't know how I'll ever repay you.
I do have a coroner buddy who's in some pretty hot water over a stolen watch.
Consider him represented.
Thanks, Roy.
I must say, this whole experience has taught me a really important lesson when it comes to some of the crazy stuff that I often see.
There's an explanation for everything?
No.
It's that the eyes never lie.
Did I tell you guys I once saw Bigfoot?
What?
Oh, you think I'm nuts, don't you?
Male or female?
Was he driving a school bus?
No Babe.
Where am I standing right now?
Denny?
What's going on?
You know, it's dudes being dudes.
Cigars.
So, listen, there's something I need to tell you.
I'm not actually a jock.
I'm a giant nerd.
I don't know what to say.
Are you angry?
No, I'm pissed.
Do you know that I've seen every single episode of the original Battlestar Galactica like 50 times?
I never told you because I thought you looked down on that stuff.
You gotta be kidding?
No.
What do you think I was watching while you went away on that business conference last weekend?
I wasn't at a business conference.
I was at Comic-Con.
No way.
I wanted to go to that.
I love you.
Aw.
I love you.
She just got even hotter.
What?
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hey, look at us, man.
We got it pretty good, huh?
Mmm, living in Santa Barbara, beautiful night, two perfect women on our arms.
How'd we do it?
Hey, hey, is this Is this pocket square okay?
Yeah, yeah, looks great.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, are those the right glasses for these drinks?
Because we can't Hey, hey, be cool.
We got this.
Hello, hello.
We're back.
Well, what does a lady have to do around here to get a dry martini?
Patience is a virtue.
So are broad shoulders, but it doesn't mean I like to wait for them.
Cheers, ladies.
Cheers.
Are you all right?
Would someone please tell me why you would drag Gus and I out of bed in the middle of the night to come down here and tend to an elderly woman who's simply resting her eyes?
This is not a crime scene.
She's not dead.
You're not dead, are you?
Shawn!
What?
Oh.
Will you focus, Shawn?
We need this case.
Do something.
Yes.
I can clearly see a victim.
In the prime of his life.
Spencer, we don't need your particular brand of theatrics here this evening.
Go home.
Go back to bed.
Lassie, are you kidding me?
The death of this man is like staring my own mortality in the face.
If someone is out there killing handsome and youthful bachelors in Santa Barbara, then all of us are in danger.
Maybe not all of us, but certainly Gus and myself.
Spencer, we've been here all of eight minutes.
For all we know, he just slipped off the balcony and fell.
Well, in that case, we should all be looking for a banana peel.
Or a roller skate.
Perhaps a wet bar of soap, though that seems the unlikeliest of the three.
McNab, please escort these gentlemen out of here.
Okay, Lassie, okay, you win.
No reason to get excited.
Buzz, I think we can see ourselves out.
No sign of wrist fractures or ankle fractures.
Tell me this guy didn't try to brace his fall from 20 feet.
All right, let's start getting witness statements.
Who do you want, the creepy old ladies or the Ken dolls?
The Ken dolls.
We're still waiting for toxicology to confirm, but it does look like he was dead before he hit the ground.
Appears to be poisoning.
So kudos to Mr. Spencer.
Sorry, Carlton.
In Lassie's defense, toxicology is not a science.
Actually, it's the science of studying toxins.
Get out of here.
No, it is.
Well, I guess that does make you look a little foolish.
You know what?
I've got the homerun suspect on this one.
Once I was given five minutes to collect my thoughts, I recognized the victim's date as one Gillian Tucker, formerly Miss Gillian Vanderholt.
Oh, I thought I recognized her.
She used to be married to Walter Vanderholt.
Closed the case on his suicide five months ago, but something never sat right with me.
What are you getting at?
I think she murdered her husband and got away with it.
Now she's dating our victim, and suddenly he's dead, too?
Come on, Chief, let me run with this one.
What if we let them work together?
Separately, but together.
That lonely bald guy in the corner makes no sense.
Am I the only person that's freaked out he's been sitting there the whole time?
Henry, this is your call.
You're the one in charge of consultants.
You're not afraid of the competition, are you, Shawn?
Of course not.
As long as it doesn't involve people trying to best each other.
Well, I'm up for it.
Matter of fact, I've already won.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end All right, let's bag and tag everything in the victim's medicine cabinet and move on over to Gillian the cradle robber.
Just Why is it that a wealthy older man can date a younger woman and he's a hero, yet an older woman chooses to empower herself and date a younger man, and she's considered some sort of social pariah?
Because it's gross.
Ugh.
Spencer, what the hell are you doing?
Sorry, Lassie.
It was not my intent to cause you to make that noise in front of the group.
But in order to get into the mindset of the victim, I rented American Gigolo last night.
You think this is prostitution?
Lance Tolkin didn't have a job, Jules.
He's dating a woman twice his age and there's a Super Troopers pinball machine in his bedroom.
It didn't pay for itself.
Gus, I'm going to need some help here.
Just stay out of our way, Spencer.
Killing with Class.
The Art of Seduction through Charm and Sophistication.
The question is, who exactly is he killing?
Hmm.
Huh.
"To Lance, one of my most artful "and gentlemanly students.
Happy hunting.
Cordially, Clive Prescott".
Clive Prescott.
Gus, I do believe we found a lead of our own.
How's your feet?
I can't feel them.
Sweet.
Wait, Gus.
I need you to be my legs.
Gentlemen, if you want to continue spend your nights with diner waitresses and tollbooth attendants, then by all means carry on your miserable way.
But if you want to surround yourself with sophistication, with elegant women who can give you anything your heart desires, then ask yourself the question, what is the picture that you are painting of yourself?
What is this, like fight club for butlers?
For instance, what did these two, uh, boys do wrong?
Ah, there must be some sort of mistake.
We're not students.
I'm Psychic Detective, Shawn Spencer.
This is my partner, Chaz Bono.
Psychic detective.
Gentlemen, this is just what I'm talking about.
If you're going to create a fake occupation, at least make it sound real.
I'm also a pharmaceutical salesman.
Well, that sounds pathetic.
And it's certainly not sexy.
Whoa.
Seriously, dude, this whole gentleman thing is not for me.
I mean, it's a little bit dated, don't you think?
What I think, is that with my method, there is no eligible woman I couldn't seduce.
How about you?
Let's just say I do fine on my own, okay?
I'm good.
Really?
Really?
What do you mean, "Really"?
What do you mean, "Really"?
When was your last successful relationship?
Define relationship.
The way in which two or more concepts, objects or people are connected or the state of being connected.
Webster.
I hardly think Emmanuel Lewis is an authority on relationships.
May I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
Have you ever been tested for idiocy?
We're here to conduct official police business, and we've got some pretty serious questions for you about the death of one of your students, Lance Tolkin.
Gentlemen, I think we can call it a day.
I'm telling you, she's not going to show.
By now, she's probably halfway to Acapulco.
Carlton, let's not jump to conclusions.
Gillian Tucker is still a very prominent woman in this town.
Look, O'Hara, in my book, it's pretty cut and dry.
This sick twit sees an opportunity to off her rich, older husband, and then she gets herself a little boy toy.
But who knows, maybe he figures out her secret, so she decides to off him, too, and then it's on to the next set of pecs.
Maybe the killing feels good, like the soft, supple flesh of a man buck.
You disturb me.
And your theory on this murder disturbs me.
And you disturb me.
You said that twice.
Yes.
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting, officers.
This whole ordeal, since it happened, I'm just beside myself.
I find it difficult just getting out of bed.
Miss Tucker, thank you very much for coming down here.
We just have a couple of questions.
Please, have a seat.
Do you recognize me, Miss Tucker?
I was the detective looking into your late husband's suicide.
No, I believe that was a much younger man.
Less salt and pepper.
We are very, very sorry for your loss, Miss Tucker, and seriously, I'm sorry, you just got out of bed?
You know, you have a funny way of mourning.
You sure didn't waste any time getting back on that horse after your husband's death.
I'm late for a business meeting.
I don't ride horses, Detective.
Miss Tucker, are you trying to seduce me?
Not even a little.
I'm not going to lie, I was not in a happy marriage, but I have my own way of mourning and I assume you have yours as well.
What is a woman my age supposed to do, Detective?
Knit?
Carlton, can I talk to you for a second?
Now?
Hmm?
Carlton, she is not going to a business meeting.
I think she's going on a date.
What makes you say that?
Well, who's she doing her hair and makeup for, you?
Maybe.
Carlton.
It's called being a detective and a woman.
She's being interviewed by two homicide cops, and she's primping like that?
Not for a meeting.
And if she's lying about where she's going, she's lying about other things, too.
Maybe you're right.
We should tail her.
That's not what I said.
O'Hara, would you stop disagreeing with me when I'm agreeing with you?
Mmm-mmm.
Can you tell us about Lance Tolkin?
Can I?
Meaning do I have the neurological and verbal ability to do so?
Sorry.
Will you?
I've heard it both ways.
Maybe on a farm you have.
Lance Tolkin had not yet mastered the art of, um, manners.
I'll leave it at that.
I'm sensing the exact opposite.
Didn't you refer to him as one of your most artful students?
One point for you, psychic.
Did something happen between you two?
Look, was he a good student?
Yes.
Did he show potential?
Perhaps more than the others.
He was good, but maybe not as good as he thought.
You sound a little angry.
Anger is easy.
A gentleman takes his ire and turns it into insight.
That's in chapter three of my book.
Good day.
What's that?
Hmm.
"Dear Gentlemen, thank you for your inquiries "about the death of my former student, Lance Tolkin.
"Good luck with the investigation.
"Cordially, Clive Prescott".
What the It's a thank you note.
This is what I'm talking about.
This guy's playing with us, Gus.
This whole gentleman thing is a sham.
I'm going to prove it, too.
Eyes peeled, O'Hara.
This is where we let her hang herself.
What Guster, what the hell?
That's a good way to get yourself shot.
What the hell are you wearing, Spencer?
I ain't Spencer.
I'm Soup Can Sam.
And unlike some detectives, when Gus and I show up for a stakeout, we try to blend in with the regular people.
Well, who's Gus supposed to be?
I'm a regular guy in a car.
I blend in fine.
Well, at least someone finally realized who the right suspect is.
I guess someone did.
Hey, he thinks we're tailing her?
She's obviously meeting her new boy toy.
Maybe one even younger than the last.
Younger?
Who do you think she's meeting with?
Justin Bieber?
Lassie, have you considered the possibility that she's the victim here?
Here we go!
Who the hell is that?
That's our guy.
Clive Prescott.
Shawn, what are you getting at?
We know who the murderer is.
And we have the homerun suspect.
And he is Santa Barbara's biggest dirty, rotten scoundrel.
The cops already got my statement the night of the crime.
I know, we read your statement.
We have questions of our own.
We now believe someone may have poisoned Mr. Tolkin's drink.
Do you remember what his drink orders were that night?
Uh, normally I wouldn't, but his caught my attention.
It was different, classy, cool.
Yes.
Sea breeze.
Uh, no.
A Gabardine Hightail.
Two parts Brora scotch, one part Drambuie, a teaspoon honey.
It was Mr. Tolkin's favorite.
In fact, Miss Tucker brought a private bottle of Brora scotch for me to keep behind the bar that night.
Just for Mr. Tolkin.
Did she now?
We're going to need that bottle.
Yes, Dad, we're following him now.
I'm surprised you didn't ask to sit in the back seat.
Your hunch was more than good, Shawn.
Prescott's last known liaison was Lorraine Bell, one of the wealthiest widows in Santa Barbara.
Maybe we should check her out when we're finished here.
Yeah, it's going to be kind of hard.
She's dead.
She went on vacation with Prescott to South America and never came back.
Died in a drowning accident.
That's interesting, Pop, but, uh He's slowing down.
We got to go.
Wait!
Wait, Shawn.
I think this guy is dangerous.
I want you to be careful.
Promise.
I think my dad is starting to like me.
Look at that, Gus, he's literally taking her to the bank.
What's the next stop?
The cleaners?
Dude, I thought you said we were just going to follow him?
That wouldn't be very much fun, now would it, Gus?
What are you gentlemen doing here?
I'm here to see my money.
They keep it in a special room in the back with a trampoline.
I'm going to roll around in it for a while, maybe make it rain.
It's sort of like that movie Indecent Proposal, except no sex.
Maybe sex.
Miss Tucker, I'm Shawn Spencer, psychic detective with the SBPD.
I'm sensing that you enjoy the company of younger men.
And for obvious reasons, I can't take my eyes off of you.
If you're done sniffing us, we have an appointment.
Excuse us.
What the hell was that?
The manager's hair?
No.
You heard what my dad said.
This guy fleeces women and they end up dead.
We got to keep him away from her, slow down this train until we get the proof that we need.
Shawn, is this about your ego and trying to prove that you have more game than this guy?
Gus, I've never been more offended.
That would be a nice bonus.
You're on your own.
Miss Tucker, I apologize for being so abrupt, but as a psychic, my gift is connection.
Knowing without saying, learning without asking, eating without chewing.
It would be my pleasure to accompany you on the town this evening.
Perhaps we could paint it purple since we were both born in February.
That's amazing.
How did you do that?
Little bit of this, whole lot of that, and just a tinge of Um, would you mind if I had a word with Mr. Spencer?
Oh.
What do you think you're doing?
Obviously, I'm flirting with the newly available widow that happens to be your dear, dear friend.
Yeah, well, you're way out of your league, so why don't you back out?
Oh, you think I can't handle your game?
It's not a game.
That's your first mistake.
Ah!
You just pushed my competitive button, and now it's on.
I'd be frightened if you were wearing any buttons.
Miss Tucker, I am so sorry to have exposed you to these juvenile antics.
Clive, I think he's rather adorable.
So is a gibbon, but have you ever tried to eat with one?
No, this man-boy here lacks all culture, elegance, and he smells of buffalo wings.
Ha!
That is where you are wrong, sir.
What you're smelling are buffalo wing-flavored Snyder's pretzels of Hanover.
It's America's pretzel.
And Hanover's, obviously.
Do you see now why this would be such a bad mistake?
Gillian.
Have you ever dated a man who was triple jointed?
Wow.
Um, no, I can't say that I have.
That's a shame.
I was hoping to discuss it with you tonight on our date.
Well, I must say, you are an original, Shawn Spencer.
And I think it would be a breath of fresh air to dine with you, and precisely what I need right now.
You've got to be kidding me.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to leave right now or I'm not going to be ready for tonight.
I'm sorry, Clive.
Guess you'll have to open this safety deposit box some other time.
One stipulation.
My friend Eugenia was recently disappointed by a gentleman friend and she could use some company.
Do you have someone for her?
As a matter of fact, I have the perfect gentleman.
Shawn, this isn't happening.
Gus, don't be George Hamilton's reaction when Ashley came to him and said, "Dad, I think I'll become an actor, too".
Keep an open mind.
This is about solving a murder.
Hello, ladies.
Your tramps have arrived.
Hello.
Well, first things first.
I always like to give a little get-to-know-you something.
Oh, my goodness, I don't know what to say.
This is Oh.
Wow.
This is a little bit awkward only because I don't wear earrings.
I mean, I used to back in the day, three of them, but that was just because of Tears For Fears.
Shawn, those are cufflinks.
Of course they are, Gus, don't be ridiculous.
Oh, um Gus?
Yes.
Uh, would you care for some gum?
Oh, I only have one piece left.
We could split it.
Eugenia's been staying with me since Walter died.
She doesn't like to go out much.
It hasn't worked out with any of the men I've set her up with.
Maybe Gus'll be the one.
Genie, isn't Gus handsome?
No.
Ooh.
Eugenia, don't look.
Don't look.
Don't look.
Gabe McKinley is over there with that tramp, Olivia Ainsley.
Oh.
Gabe was Eugenia's date at the benefit.
It didn't work out.
Ah.
I can't imagine why.
We both are so sorry to hear that.
You're not pulling your weight.
I'm trying.
Every time I smile at her, she puckers at me.
I'm not used to the pucker, Shawn.
Gillian said she's into gardening.
Ask her about flowers.
I don't know anything about flowers.
Just ask her something.
Sorry.
So, Eugenia.
Yes.
Exactly how old are you?
This is the Limox Viventi Cabernet Dumont.
Oh.
May I?
May you?
Or can you?
I think he got it right the first time.
All right.
Actually, we haven't ordered wine.
This wine is complements of the gentleman sitting right there.
Oh.
He's getting up.
Take him out.
What?
Take him out.
Sweep the leg.
I'm not sweeping his leg, Shawn.
Why won't you ever sweep the leg?
Good evening, everyone.
Well, this is unfortunate, isn't it?
You walk all the way over here only to discover that there is not room at this table for you.
Ouch.
Shawn!
Don't be silly.
There's an empty seat right here.
Thank you for that gracious invitation.
I don't know how much of a wine connoisseur you are, Mr. Spencer, but I think you will find the Dumont both nutty and shy.
Very familiar.
That was Gus on the first day of kindergarten.
Shawn.
Well, it's true.
You didn't talk to anyone.
You peed in your cubby hole.
I'd say that's pretty nutty, wouldn't you?
Okay.
Excuse me.
I'm going to join her.
What's up?
What's up?
You boys play nice.
Not together.
Look at you.
You're like a scared chicken at a slaughterhouse, and I've just rattled your cage.
You're right about the cage, but I'm a rabid hamster, and I'm just getting started, Jack.
Hello, Professor.
Mr. McKinley.
I see you're with Miss Ainsley tonight.
Why yes, I am, sir.
First date.
Seems to be going well.
Good for you.
I think you've dated everyone in this restaurant.
Well, sir, I learned from the very best.
But perhaps I'm not as good as Mr. Spencer.
You're here with Miss Tucker?
Hmm.
I was under the impression she was off limits.
Off limits?
Well, yes.
Everyone was fair game except for her.
Isn't that right, Professor?
I guess that makes you a very brave man, Mr. Spencer.
Doesn't anyone use first names anymore?
Hey, good luck.
Yeah.
I won't be needing any of that.
What's the deal with that?
I don't It goes We must remember this wine when we go to Peru.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Clive is taking me on a business trip to South America.
I've decided to invest in art, and he's found a wonderful painter in Lima that he thinks I might be interested in.
She went on vacation with Prescott to South America and never came back.
Died in a drowning accident.
Gillian, it's a little stuffy in here, don't you think?
A little bit?
What do you say the four of us roll on out, hit some place a little less Prescotty.
Well, where did you have in mind?
It creates the perfect crease crust, that's it.
Symmetry.
Symmetry.
Allowing all toppings to snuggle up and get warm under a blanket of cheese.
And bite.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm is right.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, this makes no sense.
How can she not be into me?
Why do you care?
I didn't, but now I do.
No one over the age of 32 shuts this down.
Would you stop thinking about your ego and start thinking about this case?
My ego?
Gillian, I for one am having a marvelous time.
Me, too.
But I need to ask you a teensy weensy little favor.
What?
Actually, it's more like this.
For the next couple of days, do you think that you could not speak to or hang out with Prescott?
And also, maybe not go to Peru with him either?
Shawn, are you already jealous?
I'm not sure how I feel about that.
Clive is just a friend.
You want to touch my head?
Women of all ages and races say it has magical powers.
I'm good.
Lassie?
And Jules?
Well, what a surprise!
One Gus, I thought you put a sock on the door.
One second.
I know your type.
You don't have to telegraph.
You like your man to surprise you.
I hear that.
What are you guys doing in our personal space?
We don't want to rain on your early bird special, but we thought you should know you're dating our prime suspect.
This isn't a date, come on.
We're working.
This is an investigation.
We get it.
You know, it's hard out there.
Not everybody has as many choices.
Don't be ashamed.
You don't seriously think that Gus and I are interested in these women.
Look, I don't know about you guys, we're trying to solve a murder here.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Mmm-hmm.
What's going on?
You tell me.
Oh.
Oh, that?
It's not what it looks like.
No, we get it.
Apparently, while you and Spencer were exploring your disturbing new fetish for older women, O'Hara and I were discovering we were right about Tucker.
Gillian had access to the bottle of scotch Lance was going to be drinking that night, and she may have poisoned it.
Was he drinking a Gabardine Hightail?
Prescott created that drink.
It's in his book.
Prescott taught Lance everything.
He knew what he would order.
And Prescott could have easily spiked that punch.
Now, if you don't mind, Gus is a little busy trying to get some sweet nooky off his old auntie.
For the case.
For the case.
Good luck.
Go get 'em, tiger.
You know what, Gus?
I can imagine a world where I get a little frisky with Gillian Tucker.
I don't think I need to round the bases, but, you know, slide into second safely, feel sufficient.
I got the double pull-back, Shawn.
She rejected me.
I mean, what is that?
She smelled like moth balls.
Sometimes you smell like Styrofoam.
I dig it.
What are you talking about, Shawn?
I never told you that before?
Bottom line is we kept Prescott away from Gillian.
He backed off.
It means we win, right?
Ah, I don't feel right.
I hate to say this, but I think we may have gotten some bad pineapple on that pizza.
How's your stomach?
I'm fine.
Really?
Maybe it wasn't pineapple.
Maybe somebody got to my wine at the restaurant.
Gus, I see a bright light.
I think I should go towards it.
Okay, stop playing, Shawn.
I'm going.
Take care of my Great Dane, Lothar.
You don't have a Great Dane, Shawn.
Get a Great Dane.
Name him Lothar.
Okay.
What are you talking about?
I was poisoned, buddy.
I'm sure of it.
But I know who killed me.
Remember, it was Prescott who killed me.
Shawn, the doctor's here to talk to you.
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Spencer, but there's no question.
You were poisoned.
Oh, God, Gus.
I knew it.
I told you.
I told you it was poison.
Shawn, I slept with Stacey Whitaker when we were at the cabin the summer of junior year.
I know you had a crush on her, and I'm really sorry.
There's also no question you're going to be fine.
When I say sleep, I mean literally sleep.
I was so tired that night.
I mean pooped, sawing logs.
You were barely poisoned.
There were just traces in your system.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you mean I'm not going to die?
Well, maybe from all the tapioca pudding and raisins in your stomach, but not from the poison.
That was my tapioca, Shawn.
You son of a Shawn!
How are you?
Papa.
Daddy.
Come.
Come closer.
Come and hug me.
Shawn.
Shawn.
Lassiter is interviewing Gillian and Prescott at the station.
You should be there.
I vouched for you.
Do not make me look like a fool.
Dad, I was poisoned.
I heard barely.
Come on, get your pants on.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Where were you after you left the restaurant last night?
Detective, have you ever read Lady Chatterley's Lover?
Let's stay on point, Mr. Prescott.
So you haven't read it.
In college, yeah.
It was a long time ago.
It's just that with your corn-silk hair, you might have stepped right out of its pages.
Wow.
Do you, like Lady Chatterley, feel trapped?
Emotionally.
Longing, the need, the desire to be held.
Oh, my This flowery crap actually works on you?
If you had read the book, you would understand, Shawn.
This man has actual insight into the psyche of a woman.
I saw all the Emmanuelle movies, including the one where she changed races.
I got plenty of insight into the female psyche, thank you.
Now, will you admit that your book is dated, and that I have more game than you?
I will not.
All right.
Will you admit that you tried to murder me last night by poisoning my person?
I certainly will not.
And my understanding is that you were barely poisoned.
Why do people keep qualifying that?
Mr. Prescott, you have my sincerest apologies.
You're free to go.
Pick up your I.D. with the officer at the front desk.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Did you come in here to kid me?
I had to let Gillian go as well.
We don't have enough to hold either one of them.
Hey, Dad, get in here.
No, my other father.
Would you please come in here?
Look, you've been on my side from the beginning.
Now, you cannot allow them to release this guy.
I know you from somewhere, don't I?
Yes.
Yes.
I remember you now.
A gentleman never forgets a name.
Let's see.
Henry William Spencer.
He's the only student I ever had to kick out.
You got kicked out of his seminar?
You didn't kick me out.
You invited me to leave.
Read between the lines, sir.
Oh.
Oh, Dad, this is good.
This is too good.
This is too rich.
Not only did you take the seminar, you were invited to leave?
Oh, my god, Dad.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Focus, Shawn.
One more.
Chandler Bing style.
Oh, my god.
Look, we can still nail this guy.
Prescott was dating another woman, a Harriet Finestatt.
He was seeing her at the time of her death.
A month later, the company goes kaput.
Great.
That is exactly what we need.
Shawn, I want you to give me some time to substantiate all this.
You are so close.
It's all starting to take shape.
I want you to start to think like a detective.
We sit on it.
Got it?
Got it.
The idea is to attack and conquer.
Love doesn't come to you.
You go find it.
Slay it, if necessary, but get it and bring it back.
Any questions?
I've got one.
Oh, brother.
Yes?
Why is it that you will stop at nothing to steal women's money and ultimately murder them?
That's ridiculous and untrue.
Really?
Well, then perhaps you wouldn't mind talking to the class about the death of Harriet Finestatt.
What do you want me to say?
You want me to talk about her cancer?
How I was at her bedside for months and months?
Uh-oh.
Or should I tell you about her ungrateful sons took all of her money and drove her business into the ground?
Neither of those things.
Obviously, we're very sorry for your loss, but Uh-oh.
What about the woman in South America, hmm?
The one who supposedly drowned?
Come on.
Lorraine?
She was killed by a stingray.
Now, unless you're accusing me of hiring a sea creature as a hit man Okay, well, tell me this.
What do you do when a woman who's much older than you spurns your advances?
Gus, come on.
A little decorum?
What?
You just accused him of death by stingray.
Well, why was Gillian off-limits then?
Huh?
Why don't you paint us that picture?
You want a real picture, Mr. Spencer?
I do want the real picture, so drop the gentleman act and say something real.
Why Gillian?
Because Because what?
Because I Because what?
Because I love her!
Because I love her.
All right?
I am a cad, and a deceiver, and I am hopelessly, ridiculously in love.
"Dear Prescott, I am deeply sorry "that I accused you of trying to kill me.
"Good day.
I said good day, sir.
"Signed, Shone Spencer".
You misspelled your name.
I did that on purpose.
No, you didn't.
You're right.
I was in a hurry and I didn't have spell check.
You need spell check for your own name?
Gus So what are you going to do now?
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Guster, my advice is just words on a page.
Attack and conquer, it's nonsense.
It doesn't work with a person of actual substance like Gillian.
I've got to do something.
Gentlemen, I'm going to propose.
Ooh.
Exciting for you.
No, it's exciting for you.
It's terrifying for me.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
That's why I'm asking Eugenia for tea.
I'm hoping her friend can give me advice on how to approach her.
Well, hopefully she's not as stingy with her advice as she is with her gum.
Oh, well, you have to take into account her circumstances.
What circumstances?
You don't know?
Eugenia's practically penniless.
Gillian takes care of her.
My friend Eugenia was recently disappointed by a gentleman friend and she could use some company.
Dude!
Gabe McKinley was dating Eugenia.
He broke up with her.
He realized Eugenia had no money.
He chose the wrong woman.
His buddy scored the big fish, Gillian.
Gabe was jealous.
Jealous enough to poison him to get him out of the way.
Jealous enough to poison me.
Slightly.
Yes.
Slightly We better call Jules and Lassie.
Where's Gabe McKinley?
Where is he?
Yes, I'll hold.
Stop it.
This is what Gabe was drinking in the sauna.
Looks like we may have another poisoning on our hands.
Cuff links.
Wait a minute.
Gabe was having an affair with Gillian, and that is the reason that he is dead.
Lance was dating Gillian, and that is the reason that he was poisoned, and because I went on one date with Gillian, someone tried to barely poison me.
Now I'm saying it.
Thank you.
That was the lab.
The toxicology reports are conclusive.
The principle toxin found in the poison that Lance ingested is called naphthalene.
Naphthalene?
Naphthalene.
What-thalene?
Naphthalene.
Naphthalene?
Does this mean anything to you?
In more ways than one.
Moth balls, Shawn.
Eugenia smelled like moth balls, but it wasn't her, it was the garden.
The main ingredient in moth balls is naphthalene.
Naphthalene?
That's enough.
She used them as a pesticide, but they become highly lethal if they're ingested.
It's the perfect old person's murder weapon.
The moth ball.
Of course it was her.
That's what she used to poison Gabe's energy drink and Lance's scotch.
Lassie, you can send me a thank you note later.
Well, technically you have seven days.
Yeah, you should really try to do it sooner.
Yeah, he really should.
We need to find Eugenia.
Where is she?
With Prescott.
Oh, no.
He's about to drop the bomb that he's going to propose to Gillian.
If we don't get there in time, he's victim number three.
Gripes sake!
Come on!
Move those vehicles!
Let's go!
We have to get up there before it's too late!
I'm aware of that, O'Hara.
What am I supposed to do, Shoot my way up the hill?
I will.
Or Shawn, what are you doing?
Shawn, get back in the car!
We're going to take a shortcut!
We'll meet you up there!
Get back in the car!
Meet them up there?
Have you lost your damn mind?
Aw, screw this.
What are you doing?
Carlton!
Come on!
Come on.
There we go, you Great.
Son of a Shouldn't a case with an older woman killing people be less athletic?
Hang in there, buddy.
Think about the cucumber finger sandwiches waiting for us up top.
Well, may I help you?
We need to get in.
Of course you do.
Do you have a reservation?
I'm afraid I cannot seat you without a reservation.
However, I'd be more than happy to recommend another tea service where perhaps pinecone chips are an accepted part of the dress code.
But, Lassie, you don't have a reservation to get Hey!
Prescott, don't drink that tea!
Good lord, please control yourself.
There is a lady present.
She is not a lady.
She is a murderess and a lesbian.
We'll get to that in a minute.
Isn't that right, Eugenia?
Think about it.
No one stood to lose more than Eugenia if Gillian got serious with somebody.
You're in love with her.
It was always just the two of you, and in your mind, it always would be.
Lassiter was right.
Gillian's late husband, Walter, did die under mysterious circumstances, but not at Gillian's hands.
At yours.
Isn't that right, Eugenia?
Eugenia's been staying with me since Walter died.
She doesn't like to go out much.
And it hasn't worked out with any of the men I've set her up with.
Poor Gus here never stood a chance, did he?
You only had eyes for Gillian.
Of course.
Now it makes sense.
That's why she gave me the pull-back.
She gave you the pull-back?
No one appreciated her like I do.
She always chose the wrong man.
I wanted what was best for her.
And to make sure she didn't get hurt.
I was protecting her.
Boo-hoo.
Stand up.
You better cuff her before she kills everyone in this restaurant.
Put your hands behind your back.
I always thought Gillian and I would spend our final days together.
Come on, lady.
Let's go.
As you know, gentlemen, I shall not be teaching the class for the next two weeks, as I shall be on my honeymoon.
Yes, but I have arranged during that time to present you with the wisdom of several guest speakers.
The first of which is a man I've come to know quite well over the last week.
So, without further adieu, I present to you psychic detective and true gentleman, Shawn Spencer.
You know, my best friend, Burton Guster, said that we can all afford to be a little more gentlemanly in life.
And you know what?
He was dead wrong about that.
Wow.
But I'll tell you what I can see.
The way I think is the right way to do things is not the only way.
It's barely a way at all.
Well, it's my way.
It's not a real way.
It's the way I approach something, it qualifies as a way.
But it's not a very good way.
Clive, I think you should settle down.
All right.
We can all afford to grow up a bit.
Even me.
Especially you.
The truth is I want to change.
I need to change.
You got that right.
I want my father on his deathbed four or five years from now, to look at me and say, "That That is the man that I raised".
And I want him to be pointing at some other guy, because that means that maybe, just maybe I'm not his biological son.
Hello.
Thanks for taking the time to see me.
What do you want?
Okay.
Okay.
It's not a huge deal, I just need to hear it from you.
You not being interested in me, that's solely because, you know, that you are, you know.
In love with a woman?
Yes.
That.
You do realize I'm in here because I'm being charged with a triple homicide, right?
Yes.
I get it.
You're busy.
I'm busy, too.
It's just that it's been bothering me because you dated that other guy at the beginning, at the benefit.
Yes, but I killed him.
Right.
I get that.
Would you have felt better if I had tried to kill you, too?
Well You know, you should meet a nice girl and focus on her.
And never, ever come back here.
Okay.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
You ready?
Yep.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
What?
I can't reach the brake!
Gus, get down there and stop us.
Wait, why do I have to be the feet?
How come you just can't be taller?
No, whoa, whoa, Shawn!
What do you think you're doing?
Well, the important question is what are you doing home?
I'm a detective.
New job.
New hours.
Can you write those down for me?
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.
We were only going to go as far as the end of the driveway.
I don't care how far you were going to go, Shawn.
You're not old enough to drive.
Get out.
Out.
Now!
Right there, right there.
Ready.
- Copy.
Load it in.
Back away!
Everybody back away!
Come on.
Get out.
Out of the car!
Get out of the car!
All units be advised 2- 11 of a vehicle just occurred at Property taken was a white Lamborghini Murcielago.
Suspect last seen travelling southbound.
Stolen car.
Not a car.
It's a Lamborghini.
Copy!
Car 7-0, en route to assist.
I have a pretty good idea who's behind this carjacking.
Who?
I've been investigating a group of car thieves who have been working in town for the last few months.
They're street racers.
They finance their lifestyle by boosting exotic vehicles.
Whoa!
Slow down!
And how do you know these are the guys you've been investigating?
Oh, it's them.
I know it.
Carlton.
There they are.
Car 7-0, we have visual on the Lamborghini traveling south on Mariposa.
Requesting backup.
Damn it!
Carlton, we lost him.
I'm not giving up that easy.
I've spent too long trying to nail this son of a bitch.
He's halfway to the city limits by now.
O'Hara, if you don't wanna help, you're more than welcome to get out right now.
We are three miles from the station.
All units be advised stolen Lamborghini located at the corner of Eighth and Waterfront.
This is Detective Lassiter.
Secure the area and stand down!
No one approaches that vehicle until I get there.
Do you copy?
Officers, stand down!
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end And that, my dear Gus, is why one should not text and drive.
Mmm-hmm.
Spencer, get away from the vehicle!
Shoo!
This is an absolutely lovely crime scene you have here, Lassie.
I especially enjoy what you do with the What's that called?
Yellow tape.
Crime scene tape.
It's there for a reason.
Look, we only came over to get a closer look at the ride because I used to have one just like it.
Gus and I built it from scratch in auto shop.
Spencer, you don't want this case.
Oh, but I do.
But you can't have it.
Oh, but I will.
Stop it.
Look, Lassie, I know we've had our kerfuffles in the past, but let's be honest.
This has all the makings of a Psych special.
Fast cars.
Fast food.
Fast women.
Murder.
That, too.
Enough.
The answer is no.
I've done too much work on this case already so I will thank you to get lost.
In fact, I'll even help you.
Miller, escort these two out of here, please.
Well, in that case, I guess we'll just have to race you for it.
What!
Go give them a ticket.
We know the Lamborghini was traveling approximately the driver was killed so we can extrapolate the shooter's location based on how long it took the dead man's car to come to a stop.
Well, how did the shooter even find him?
They found an illegal tracking device under the hood.
Now watch.
Awesome driving.
Thank you, McNab.
There's actually quite a bit more to pursuit driving than most people think.
I was talking about the other guy.
Watch for the flash, Gus.
As soon as Lassie hits 88, he goes back in time.
And this time, he does not go to the prom with his sister.
It was his mother, and it was the "Enchantment Under the Sea" dance.
Come on, man.
It was a throw-away.
So we could make an entrance.
But you got it wrong.
I can't do this with you right now.
Spencer, I am trying to investigate a murder, so unless you have a reason to be here, leave.
Oh, I have a reason.
I'm getting that the shooter was in a second car, one with wide tires found on street-racing hot-rod type vehicles.
Tell me something I don't know.
All right.
America's never lost a war when donkeys were in use and the Lamborghini's vehicle identification number was altered, which means it was stolen before.
I knew that already as well.
The part about the VIN number, not the donkeys.
That's an interesting fact.
What I need to know is where the shooter's car was.
Well, why don't you just extrapolate based on how long it took for the dead man's car to coast to a stop?
Yeah.
What chocolate Einstein just said.
Um, Lassie, are you humming danger music?
We're done here.
O'Hara, we got an ID on that victim yet?
His name is Max Contreras.
He's a known street racer, has a long list of priors.
And get this.
He's a huge gambler.
Owes a bundle to none other than Logan Paget.
Who's that?
Paget's a big time exotic car collector and suspected loan shark.
That's interesting.
By the way, it's pronounced "Paget".
No, it isn't.
It is when I say it.
Now let's saddle up and go talk to this frog.
He is not French, Shawn.
And that term is a slur.
Oh, please.
He won't be offended.
The French are known for their wonderful sense of humor.
Excuse me.
You're not going anywhere on this, Spencer, because you're not on this case.
Understood.
Dad!
They're on the case.
Henry!
With all due respect, Carlton, you've been after these guys for months with no luck, and now someone is dead.
It's time for all hands on deck.
That comes straight from the chief.
Not me.
I don't need help questioning Paget.
"Paget".
Shut up.
That's why we're sending Shawn and Gus to see if they can find any street racers that Contreras hung with.
Maybe they can help.
What do you even know about street racing anyway?
Only what we learned from The Fast and the Furious.
So everything.
Mmm-hmm.
Fine.
But don't think we're partners on this.
I'm in charge.
I promise to follow you to the letter.
As long as that letter isn't "Q".
Or any other vowel, for that matter.
Shawn, you're to play by the book on this one.
You find anything out, you make any move, you first report to Lassiter.
Got it?
Done and done.
Are we really going to check everything with Lassiter?
Of course not.
Don't be ridiculous.
That's a '93 Avanti.
They only made 189 of these things.
Its design was inspired by the '64 Studebaker Avanti.
Here, see the square headlights?
Seven "Z" type.
'09 Aston Martin.
We have work to do, Mister Bond.
Right.
Yes.
Mister Paget.
It's pronounced "Paget".
I've heard it both ways.
I'm Detective Lassiter.
This is my partner, Detective O'Hara.
We have a few questions for you about Max Contreras.
We understand you knew him.
Max was a business associate.
He worked for me occasionally.
He was a gifted mechanic.
An artist.
Irreplaceable.
Just like one of your precious porcelain dolls.
You see, I don't collect dolls.
You look like the kind of guy who does.
We also know that Max owed you a lot of money.
Am I to assume that I'm now a suspect in your murder case?
No.
Don't touch, please.
Don't be stupid, Mister Paget.
We both know that even the lowest of two-bit loan sharks doesn't kill someone who owes them money.
Ouch.
When did you last talk to Contreras?
Ah, it's been weeks.
Weeks.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to prepare this baby for an auction.
Yeah, just one more question.
You were the You were the Would you turn that off?
Turn off the car!
You're the registered owner of the vehicle that Max was driving the night he was murdered.
Yes.
It was taken from a restaurant valet.
That's interesting because we don't have any record of you reporting it stolen.
Hmm.
Must have slipped my mind.
See, I think you are hiding something.
Maybe I just have that kind of face.
Dude, we've been to five of these places and no one's heard anything about street racing or even heard of Max.
Just do this one, and then I'll get you some astronaut ice cream.
Damn right, you will.
Excuse us.
Hello.
Ooh.
I'm Shawn.
This is my associate, MC Clap Yo Handz.
With a "Z".
We're looking for some street racing action.
Or any kind of action.
Don't know anything about that so you can get the hell out of here.
With a "Z".
Dude, she's lying.
I know.
There's no "Z" in asses.
I'm talking about the street racing.
Right, right.
Huh.
What?
Seriously!
Dude, do that again.
I've been trying to come up with an entrance bit like that since I accidently threw Gus' wallet into a fireplace.
I knew a squirrel didn't swipe it off a windowsill.
There was a squirrel outside and it was eyeing your wallet.
You lying bastard.
I was positing a theory to help cushion the blow for you.
You ruined my wallet and blamed it on an animal.
Squirrels bite, Gus.
So what?
And you wanted to believe it.
Hey, whoa, hey!
Who the hell are you guys?
They're nobodies.
And by nobodies, she means experienced street racers who also happen to dabble in flatulence.
What?
I'm sorry.
Stamp collecting.
It's "philately," Shawn.
I'm afraid that's the word for "fart".
You need to get the hell out of here.
Damn, girl.
Hold on.
Take it easy, Gina.
Clearly, these guys are insane.
They're just looking to have some fun.
I race hard.
You race hard.
You're an awesome key flipper, I can play Sowing the Seeds of Love on the recorder.
He has that head.
Now we all know each other.
Why don't you tell us where the next race is?
What's your name?
Shawn.
There's an old saying, Shawn.
"If you need to ask, you don't belong there".
I knew that.
Then why'd you ask?
Well, if you must know, it's a rhetorical question.
Sort of like, "Where's Waldo?
" Or "Are you smarter than a fifth grader"?
If you can find the race, happy to see you there.
Cool, man.
Gus!
For goodness sake, careful.
I'm sorry.
He's all thumbs.
Are you guys done here?
Sorry again about that.
Oh, my You're making a mess.
I had that perfectly organized.
I need a map.
Where's the map?
Under my backup breath mints, next to my lavender scalp oil.
Lavender scalp oil?
You've been using that stuff since we did that model thing, huh?
Every day.
A player needs to shine, Shawn.
What are you doing?
Wait a minute, these are streets and times and dates.
Gus, I know where the next race is.
We just need wheels.
That's a negative, Shawn.
You already tricked out my car once.
Yeah, and it looked awesome.
And I almost got fired.
Fine.
We'll have to figure something else out then.
Everybody else's hood stays up by themselves.
How long do I have to do this?
Gus, we have to feature the engine.
We have to show it to people.
That's what they do.
Sit tight.
I'm going to go get my Paul Walker on.
This is embarrassing.
Your dad's going to kill you for taking his truck.
Monte Carlo, huh?
It's blue.
It's boxy.
What the hell are you talking about, man?
I'm talking about your machine, man.
My buddy Max had one just like it.
Max Contreras.
El Guapo.
Do you guys know him?
I know he got a bullet put in his head.
Yeah, I heard that.
Bummed me out.
You wouldn't happen to know who did it, would you?
You know what we do with little guys who come around here asking bitch-ass questions?
I'm guessing he doesn't break into song?
No, we kick their bitch asses!
Uh Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Chill out, man.
Chill out!
All right?
You're not going to do nothing.
You're going to turn around.
You're going to walk out of here.
You understand?
Yeah.
Side note.
That guy would have killed me.
Yeah.
Quickly and quietly.
My body turns up in a ditch somewhere.
Nah, they would have never found your body.
No body.
And yet, you didn't back down.
Well, you know I don't really like to Think ahead.
Yes.
I understand that approach well.
You found the race.
Here I am.
You know I won't say I'm not impressed.
You're awesome.
You have a great crew.
You look like Flea.
Come on, guys.
Gus, look.
Ta-da!
This is your ride?
Seriously?
She may look like hell.
She may sound like hell.
She may run like hell.
She may smell like hell.
Shawn.
But she is fast as hell.
I guess we should do this then, huh?
Absolutely!
Do what?
How was this a good idea?
What would you have me do, Gus?
Huh?
Back down?
No.
I've got to protect my rep.
You don't have a rep.
I'm building it, dude.
Don't you see?
If we're going to get to the bottom of Max's murder, we've gotta have some street cred.
Hey, Nix!
We're racing for pinks.
As in pink slips?
Like ownership papers?
Pink's Hot Dogs.
I have a coupon.
That's my coupon.
It's his coupon.
Good.
'Cause I'd rather have that than your truck.
Oh, yeah?
You sure about that?
I'm sure.
I think I can beat this guy.
Are you insane?
I have a secret weapon.
What!
Nitrous?
You are insane.
You wouldn't believe how easy that thing was to install.
No, Shawn, it's incredibly complicated.
Did you retool the front end?
Nope.
Did you adjust the intake?
What's an intake?
Did you exchange the exhaust valve?
Jeez, Gus, you know so much about this.
I should have had you install it.
Let me out of this car.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, dude, ready?
Hit it!
Absolutely not.
We can win this thing.
We can also die.
Stop it!
No!
Ah!
I won't forgive you for this.
Thank you.
I said I won't forgive you.
Viva México!
You kidding me?
We did it!
He beat us, Shawn.
By so much less than I thought he would.
Uh-oh.
I knew it.
You must have accidentally cut the brake line when you installed the nitrous.
Please.
The only thing I cut was that long cable going from the pedals to the rear wheels.
I'm going to kill you, Shawn!
Are we dead?
I'm not.
But if you are, can I have the $6,218 in your your rainy-day money-market account?
How do you know exactly how much money I have in there?
Wild guess.
Wow!
That's some of the craziest stuff I've seen in a long time!
Whoo!
You know you two have got a lot of balls.
Four, actually.
And a phantom one that I call "Rigby".
Or your asses are just lucky.
Look, Gina, don't be We live on the edge, Tommy.
I thought you were a lot of talk.
We are all talk.
No, we're not.
Gus, we're not.
We're all action.
Listen, we're having a party tomorrow night at the shop.
You make me laugh.
You two should come.
We'll be there, man.
I almost got killed pulling out of my own damn driveway.
I warned you two about going by the book on this one, so unless you've got something useful from that little stunt, I'm cutting you loose.
Dad, we've got something more than useful.
Gus and I have identified Max's old crew.
We're already making inroads.
That's right.
Pretty soon we'll get nicknames.
I'm thinking Torch and Road Rash.
You lied to us, Paget.
Really?
How so?
You said that you hadn't spoken to Max Contreras in weeks, but your phone records tell a different story.
In fact, you talked to him quite a bit last week, including Tuesday night at 8:41.
Right after Max boosted your Lamborghini.
Tell us again why you never reported your car stolen?
I've kind of been busy, you know.
Bull crunch.
Max knew exactly who boosted your car, so he made you an offer.
He was gonna recover it for you and you were gonna erase his debt.
Only you didn't trust Max.
After all, he was a thief.
So you called him up and sure enough he had a change of heart.
He was gonna keep the car for himself so you hopped in your fastest vehicle, you tracked him down and took him out.
I've got you on conspiracy to commit grand theft.
And I'm just getting started.
Okay.
Yes, I hired Max.
Yes, I called him after he retrieved my car.
But he didn't tell me that he had a change of heart.
Well, what did he say, then?
He said someone was after him.
Who?
He didn't get a chance to tell me that.
And from the sound of his voice, he was scared.
Whoever it was, he knew they were going to get to him.
Shawn, you agreed that Lassiter would be point on this investigation.
I expect you to honor it.
Tell him now.
Tell me what?
All right.
It took a brush with death, but Gus and I were able to infiltrate Max's old crew and I am sensing that is where we will find his killer.
Huh.
Based on what Paget says, that actually makes sense.
Whoever killed Max had to be a better driver than him.
Maybe it was an old street racing buddy or somebody that he, I don't know, used to boost cars with.
Things went bad between them.
Max decides to take this guy out.
Adequate job, Spencer.
O'Hara and I will shake these gearheads down.
Where can I find him?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lassie.
Tap the brakes.
You can't just go in there and slap these guys around all limp-wristy, expecting them to tell you everything.
I've never had a limp wrist in my life.
Look, these dudes are a tribe, all right?
They've very close-knit, which is why Road Rash and I will be hanging out with them tonight.
Why do I have to be Road Rash?
Because I'm Torch.
I want a different nickname.
They all know you as Road Rash.
Everybody does.
If you switch now, there will be mass confusion.
Shawn, you made that name up one minute ago.
Fine.
What do you want to be called?
Mellow Rush.
That sounds like a crappy energy drink that gives you tongue hives.
How about Crankshaft?
The old, cantankerous man from the comic strip?
Okay.
Fine.
Miss Whiddleberry it is.
Enough!
Enough!
Look, Shawn is right.
If he and Gus can go out and get enough concrete evidence to nail the shooter, I say it's worth it.
You have six hours to give me a suspect, and I want the address where you're going to be.
Done.
You ready to go, G- Force?
Now that's what's up.
What!
What!
All right, now listen.
When you're with me, what's mine is yours.
Can I have that puka shell necklace?
No.
No.
Of course.
I was kidding.
Dude, did you make a chain out of paperclips?
Gus, I didn't have a lot of time.
What I had was office supplies.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Worst crash ever, Phoenix '06.
Hands down.
I'm in a GTO and racing this Supra.
A total ricer kicking his import ass, doing 90.
All of a sudden my back end gets loose.
Boom!
Hit the guardrail, flip it six times.
Dag, Stig, you're lucky to be alive.
Yeah.
Talking about worst crash, how about Tommy last year at Bonneville.
Oh, man, okay, he's trying to get to 200, right?
The front end of his Camaro came off the ground, flew like what?
Like 50 feet?
What?
By the end there was hardly any car left.
It was crazy.
Tommy was in a coma for a month.
It was barely three weeks.
It was a little nap.
I can't wait to try it again.
What do you have, a death wish?
No.
It's just the opposite, Whiddleberry.
They say that when you're going that fast, that's when you really know what it is to be alive.
It's pure adrenaline.
It's not about the speed and checkered flags.
Anybody with the right engine and enough horsepower can do that.
It's about freedom and barriers.
You tell me I can't do something, I'm going to show you that I can.
Or I'm going to die trying.
Adrenaline, that's God's greatest gift.
How close did you get?
almost taste it.
You want the ultimate thrill?
You got to be willing to pay the ultimate price.
Point Break.
Nice.
I think you should go for it, man.
Do whatever it takes.
And what about you, Gina?
Awfully quiet over there.
How'd you get your war wound?
Vegas, '09.
Dodge Challenger.
Ran a red light and got T- boned by a big rig.
Yeah.
Max was driving.
Gina loses the use of two of her fingers and Max walks away without a scratch.
Some boyfriend, huh?
Ex-boyfriend.
Whatever.
Son of a bitch never even apologized to you.
I'd never treat you that way.
You know what?
I never trusted the bastard, so I say good riddance.
Hey, Max was once a good friend to all of us.
That's how we're going to remember him.
You're right.
Let's go outside.
Not you.
Now she wants to talk, huh?
We can talk.
Or What are you doing?
That's my car!
She's a beauty.
Nova, huh?
Did you know that no va means "no go" in Spanish?
These bad boys did not sell well in the Latin American countries, except, curiously, Honduras.
Stig and Juice Box really hating on Max in there.
What's that all about?
You ask a lot of questions.
Oh, yeah?
Mmm-hmm.
Huh.
Ooh.
Hey!
Relax, I think we got this backwards.
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm looking for a wire.
A wire?
Are you Are you crazy, Gina?
You think I'm a cop?
I'm not a cop.
I'm a car guy, just like you.
Except you're a girl, obviously.
Car guy, huh?
Just like me?
Just like you.
Tell me exactly what you see here.
All right, what do we got?
We got a A fan belt, a radiator, air filter.
Cowl induction.
Sure.
Rochester four-barrel, Edelbrock intake, open headers, Exactly.
Exactly.
Those are the mods on Tommy's car.
Not mine.
Tell me exactly who you are, Shawn.
Right now.
All right.
I guess I should start at the beginning.
It's 1976.
Fernando was at the top of the charts.
A Georgia peanut farmer was the leader of the free world.
Now, Gina, don't do anything crazy.
I don't hit women.
Freeze!
Put down the firearm!
Back off, now!
Get your hand off me, cop!
Punch me in the face.
What?
You're gonna blow my cover!
Now punch me in the face!
I'm not going to punch you in the face.
Ronald Reagan was a terrible president.
You son of a bitch!
I'll go quietly.
Get up!
There they are.
Nice work, guys.
Thank you, Buzz.
No.
I meant nice work getting owned by a girl.
Okay.
For your information, we did not get owned.
We refused to fight back.
We don't hit women.
That's right.
No, but apparently she does.
We got the preliminary ballistics on Gina's gun.
It was used to kill Max Contreras.
Gina was the shooter?
Not Gina.
That was her alias.
Her real name was Mary Armstrong.
I almost made out with a woman named Mary Armstrong?
You weren't about to make out with anybody.
Says who?
She kicked you in the belly.
After I disarmed her and saved your butt.
I'm sorry.
She just didn't seem like a Mary Armstrong to me.
Maria?
Sure.
Marisol, Mandinga.
Her name's not important.
What's important is that she was Max's ex-Iover and part of the crew that stole Paget's Lamborghini.
Max betrayed them when he stole it back, so she went after him and took him out.
And the good news, gentlemen, is that she is going away for a very long time.
Your lunch money is safe.
All right, look, guys, the big score here is that we all worked together.
I think we've turned a corner.
Great work.
I don't like the way that shook out at all.
Lassie smugly breaking down the case, people laughing at our expense.
Gina turns out to be Mary.
It's all very vexing.
Don't you feel vexed?
No.
We solved the case.
It all worked out the way it should be.
No.
That is what is disturbing me.
It never works out the way it should.
That's not our process.
Our process is messy.
It's haphazard.
It's definitely not like that.
I don't buy it.
Well, you're not going to get it for free.
What is wrong with you?
You're driving like a maniac!
I think these car people are rubbing off on me, Gus.
I'm doing it fast and furious.
I'm living life a quarter mile at a time.
Will you get over this thing and stop talking like a movie poster?
Wait a minute.
Gina loses the use of two of her fingers.
Tell me exactly who you are, Shawn, right now.
Why are you singing Lassie's danger music?
It's catchy.
And the shot that killed Max came from the right.
Yeah.
So?
So, Gina can't grip anything with her right hand.
Not a wrench, not a steering wheel, and definitely not a gun.
So if she was the one chasing Max, she would have to steer and shoot with the same hand.
No one can do that.
Not at 90 miles an hour.
You know what this means, Gus?
Gina is not our killer.
Don't you mean Mary?
No.
She'll always be Gina to me.
All right.
Sher-black-Iock.
If it wasn't Gina, who was it?
It's obvious, Shawn.
It's Tommy.
Gus, don't be the second drummer from 38 Special.
It clearly wasn't Tommy.
Why are you not getting this?
These guys are like the mafia and Tommy's like a street racing Don Corleone.
There's a code of honor and Max broke it when he stole that car.
It easily could have been one of the other dudes.
Stig, obviously in love with Gina.
Juice Box, they didn't trust the bastard.
Shawn, it's Tommy.
You know it.
He was the one driving Gina's car.
Why is everyone suddenly breaking down this case but me?
Because you won't.
And worse still, you broke the first rule of undercover work.
You got too close.
You've gone all Point Break.
Okay, that's just nuts.
Is it, Johnny Utah?
Don't you dare use that name as a slur.
I don't have to stand for this.
Give me your keys so I can storm out of here.
No.
Take your motorcycle.
All right.
Hey, windbreaker or pea coat?
Windbreaker.
Hands down, worst stormer-outer ever.
Psychic detective?
That's pretty cool.
You must have seen some wild stuff.
Oh, you have no idea.
Once there was this shark Shawn.
Right.
This kills me to say, but, Tommy, you are a thief and you are a murderer.
We know you killed Max.
You pinned it on Gina and you almost managed to bamboozle me with your incredible awesomeness.
Almost?
Sorry, dude, I will never doubt you again.
Now who's a liar?
Touché.
Listen, it's over.
We got you.
You can't kill everyone.
Yeah, you're right.
Max used the car as an insurance policy against me coming after him.
He thought I wouldn't risk destroying something that meant so much to me.
He just didn't know me as well as he thought he did.
I'm not the one to lose ever.
He was sloppy so he had to go.
For Gina, eventually they're going to figure out that she's innocent.
But by then I'll be long gone.
So unfortunately that just leaves one thing to do before I leave.
You tell me I can't do something, I'm going to show you that I can.
Or I'm going to die trying.
The Lamborghini.
You're going to steal the Lamborghini again.
Psychic.
Who told you, right?
That's insane.
It's locked up in the police impound.
You're not getting it.
This is where you come in.
You're going to go and you're going to get it.
Is that right?
Suppose I go there and tell them exactly what you're up to.
You're probably going to have to.
But I just want you to know, Shawn, that if I see any cops coming, your friend's going to die.
That was quick.
Guys at impound must have not been paying attention.
No, they were.
Then I busted out the Rice Krispie treats.
It's like fly paper, man.
Seriously, those things are really sticky.
Where's Gus?
This guy's always entertaining, you know?
I'm going to miss that.
Save your compliments, Tommy.
Toss me the keys.
Gus first!
I'm in here.
Let me out!
Seriously, dudes?
There's plenty of room in this car!
Why'd you have to put him in the trunk?
It's a very small back seat.
Get over there.
Now toss me the keys.
I like you, Shawn.
But I will kill you.
That's a smart move.
Let's go.
Get over here.
All right, good.
What is that?
Cops put a tracker on this car.
I'd do the same thing.
Cops aren't stupid, I'm just smarter.
All right, I'd say they're about two minutes away.
Boys, we're good to go.
Get out of here, all right?
Just scatter.
Catch you later.
See you, boys.
You know I was serious when I said that it would be good to have a guy like you come along.
You should come with us.
Come on.
You got the kamikaze in you.
I can smell it.
It's not the kamikaze.
It's CK One.
It's for men and women.
And you know what, you're full of it, man.
God's greatest gift is not adrenaline.
It's friendship.
I would never do anything to hurt Gus.
Even if he betrayed me.
And he feels the same way about me.
Um Have it your way.
So we're letting him go?
Shouldn't that sentence start with, "Hey, man, thanks for saving my life"?
Okay.
Thank you.
But we're still letting a murderer go free.
I got three zucchini and a gourd that says we're not.
That crazy son of a bitch isn't gonna stop.
No!
No!
No!
Maybe he is.
Move in!
Vegetables in the tailpipe.
I don't know if that's brilliant or stupid.
Probably stupid.
Well, there's a fine line between the two.
Hey, Shawn, still about freedom and barriers.
No regrets, bro.
Yeah.
Good luck selling that to the other murderers in cell block C, bro.
Mrs. Whiddleberry, nothing personal.
The name is Gus.
Mrs. Whiddleberry?
It used to be G-Force.
Briefly.
Very briefly.
Well, Spencer, this was a big collar for you.
Congratulations.
It's a shame I have to put in a recommendation for your suspension.
What?
You stole a car from the police impound.
He was gonna kill Gus.
He was bluffing.
I'm afraid I couldn't take that chance.
You don't negotiate with kidnappers.
It's Cop 101.
But we're talking about Gus.
He's one of us.
Barely.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
That was insensitive.
The fact of the matter is I'm quite fond of you, Guster.
Although, professionally, I do often wonder what you bring to the table.
Carlton.
I'm being honest.
Okay, Lassie, things Gus brings to the table.
One, the blueberry.
Two, the super sniffer.
Three, a positive working attitude.
Four, feng shui expertise.
Oh, it is such a shame that you didn't get to see me behind the wheel of that machine.
Mmm-hmm.
What do you say the two of us take it for a little spin?
It's still evidence, Shawn.
You know you want to.
No.
No.
I really don't.
Yeah, you do because you have the kamikaze in you, and I can smell it from a mile away.
That's disgusting.
That's Point Break!
Never seen it.
You've never seen Point Break?
Nope.
I've seen Fast Break.
Fast Break?
With Gabe Kaplan?
Spencer, get out of the car!
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Sir.
Henry, you screwed up.
With all due respect, Chief, I got the guy.
He had a partner.
And I'll get him, too.
You're a detective now.
The stakes are higher.
I'm not here to ride you.
You made a mistake.
Own up.
Don't do it next time.
I'll work overtime, sir.
I'll fix this.
No, you won't.
I gave the case to Peters and Boone.
I get that.
They're the best we've got, but sir, believe me, I can take You can leave now.
Yes, sir.
I've done business with some shady people in my day, but you two, you just might be the worst of the worst.
Okay.
You come and get me.
I'll squeeze the coward out of the both of you!
What's today, casual Friday?
No, Shawn, it's my day off.
Chief wanted all living bodies on hand.
You know who the victim is, don't you?
Santa Barbara's oldest lobsterman.
No, Shawn, Herb Wilkins.
Best chief this department's ever had.
And my boss for over 20 years.
Well, here's the good news, looks like he lived eight or nine decades before he met his maker.
I'm going to ask you to be respectful here.
I will politely decline.
Come on, Dad, I'm kidding.
All right, I get it.
Who are the old guys?
Boone and Peters, veterans of the SBPD.
Worked under Herb for many, many years.
Volunteers these days.
These guys are legends.
So are leprechauns, but you don't see them rolling out crime tape.
You guys wish you had one tenth of the knowledge these guys currently have.
Hey, buddy.
Henry.
Good to see you.
Right here.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Oh, come on, Dad, these guys are retired.
The only thing they do now is keep minors from doing whip-its at the 7-Eleven.
These guys knew Herb better than anyone on the planet.
Quit being a wiseass.
You two might learn something here.
The only thing I'm going to learn from those two is what time the HomeTown Buffet closes.
It closes at 8:00.
What?
It closes at 8:00, Shawn.
As many of you now know, the deceased is Herb Wilkins.
He was SBPD's Police Chief for 20 years.
And we don't know what this is yet, but Herb's legacy is to be protected.
Looks like the poor guy offed himself.
Definitely did not off himself.
I'm having a clear vision on a cloudy day.
Herb Wilkins did not Kill himself.
Thank you, Mr. Peters, is it?
If it's all right with you, I'd like to continue.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
I am the psychic detective for the Psychic?
Son, we don't mess with the devil.
Now you better ride that goat with someone else.
The devil?
Really?
All right, well, how else would I know that he Was wrapped up in duct tape?
Which explains why he's missing hair on his wrist.
Sir, I'm doing my best to respect your legacy and your wisdom, the many world and civil wars that you have both seen and perhaps fought in And Herb was not killed on this boat.
Chief, I can tell you definitively, Herb did not die on this boat.
Nope.
Not on this boat.
Nowhere near this boat.
He was killed at another location, TBS.
It's TBD, Shawn.
What's TBS?
The superstation.
Is it really, though?
This is embarrassing.
It's fine.
He hasn't said anything I didn't already know.
My theory will be proven correct after a quick inspection of Herb's gun.
One problem there, Ricky Nelson, this is not Herb's gun.
And you know that how?
Because Herb went to bed every night with his favorite six-shooter.
And he named it Darla Saidman.
His gun was Jewish?
And Herb wouldn't be caught having an affair with a Beretta.
You know I never named my gun.
How about Mr. Thunderstick?
This Beretta was placed on the deck by the killer.
And the serial number's filed off.
Which makes it untraceable.
See what I'm talking about?
It's a nice suggestion, Mr. Spencer.
No, no, I haven't done anything yet, Chief.
No.
I was speaking of your father suggesting that we bring down Peters and Boone.
All right, listen up, folks.
I will find this cop killer.
Wrong again, Rick.
Herb was carried on this boat, one person under the arms, one person on the feet, which means we are looking for two cop killers.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know So once upon a time they were good cops.
I have a gift, Gus, and you have me.
Besides we're both young and viral.
It's virile, Shawn.
The point is it's a couple of old tortoises versus two young swift hares.
The tortoise won the race.
Only because he was tired.
That makes no sense, Shawn.
I think we should relax, take a load off, have some of my dad's yum treats, and talk about why Meshach Taylor came back for Mannequin 2, when everyone else said no.
I want all teams in my office.
AII?
No, no, no, Dad.
Peters and Boone again?
I've officially brought them on as consultants for the case.
Now get in here.
The meeting's starting.
Come on.
Come on.
Stay in the background.
I'll try not to embarrass you this time.
I can embarrass myself just fine on my own.
You got that right, Rick.
Mr. Peters, sir, is there something about me that has rubbed you the wrong way?
Perhaps my strong hairline or muscular haunches?
You and your sidekick are untrained pests.
Floyd and I have very little patience with your malarkey, shenanigans or tomfoolery.
The big three.
Sure.
Do you mind if I start this meeting?
By all means, Chief.
Okay, now, it's all hands on deck.
No talking to the press.
I put a hold on all vacations.
And Vacation sequels.
I think the Griswolds have been through quite enough.
And I want to be kept in the loop on every detail on this case.
What's up?
You looking for a handout?
I'm just being cordial.
You're eyeballing my watch.
It's a Casio.
You just proved my point, slick fingers.
Can we focus please?
Okay, what do we have so far?
Well, we're working on getting access to Herb's house.
We should be able to get in there by late this afternoon.
We sent the prints pulled from the crime scene to the lab for processing.
And we spoke to Herb's daughter, Caroline.
She's flying in from Boston to make arrangements.
They hadn't spoken in years, so, I don't think she's going to be much help to the case.
What?
Do you realize that all Peters and Boone do now is play checkers at the park with other retired cops?
These guys are still the best.
You saw the work they did down at the docks.
It's called luck.
Shawn, a good cop's instincts never go away.
Look, it is your fault that they are stomping all over my turf with their double-Velcro easy steppers!
When a cop retires, he should stay retired.
What are you saying?
That I should never have come out of retirement?
I'm saying that it is time for you to take off the '70s goggles and see the world, the entire world, has passed those guys by.
I'm sorry to hear that you feel that way about my coming back to work.
Thank you very much.
Oh, God.
We're heading for Herb's live bait shop, dig up some clues.
Hey, sweetie, when we get back, we're going to need a fresh pot of Joe and a baker's of glazed.
For the love of God, Boone, I am a detective.
Sure you are.
We could leave in an hour and still beat them to the dock by four days.
You know that's right.
Did you know Herb had a live bait shop?
No, I did not.
Damn it.
I'm not going to sugar coat this for you.
This is a tough moment for us, Gus.
Yes, it is.
We have friends who saw you having words with Herb.
Well, everyone had words with him.
We bought bait at his shop all the time.
We heard he didn't look very happy.
Herb was never happy.
He was a cranky old man.
We should avoid Peters and Boone until we have something juicy.
Then throw our something juicy in their faces.
Like rotten peaches.
What!
Where are we going to get peaches?
Mmm-mmm, but I really like that idea.
Me, too.
But I think we should get fresh peaches and eat them instead.
Right in front of them.
Ooh!
How about a churro?
Hello, ma'am, my name's Shawn Spencer.
This is my partner, Imhotep or "He cometh in peace".
Go ahead, show her your "Cometh in peace" face.
We'd like to ask you a couple questions about one of your fellow wharf-mates.
Yeah, I heard about Herb.
It's so sad.
Did he have any enemies that you know of?
No, I don't think so.
How about frenemies?
Pret-enemies?
How about Pal-holes?
Herb was pretty tough, but everybody respected him.
So you can't think of anything unusual that was going on?
There was one thing I found odd.
He was spending a lot of quality time with a young girl.
Is that right?
What can you tell us about that little harlot?
Not much.
Uh, long red hair, about 20 years old.
I can't remember her name.
Samantha maybe?
She works at the Pacific Treasures shop over there.
Right over here?
Thank you.
We'll talk to her.
You won't find her there.
She hasn't opened her shop the past few days.
Really?
Really?
Really.
Really.
Okay, Randy, now what we're going to play is a little game called damn good chance you getting shot.
Tuck the shooter, Floyd.
Tuck it?
This is how I do it, man.
I know this is how you do it, but this is not the time to do it.
How you do it.
I ain't tucking her once she's out.
Tuck it, Floyd!
Should we step in?
Just a little tiff, Gus.
Besides, there's no bullets in that gun.
How sure are you?
One in six chance.
Those are the exact odds, Shawn.
Well, the palm reader and that guy who looks like a young LaWanda Page decided to join us.
LaWanda Page?
From Sanford and Son?
You're damn right.
You let that hair grow out and you'll look just like her.
You do have a little LaWanda in the eyes, Gus.
Shut up, Shawn.
Can I go now?
Yeah, you can go.
Hey, I'm going to be watching you.
Me, too.
Just for the record, I'm a psychic, not a palm reader.
What you are is 172 pounds of we don't give a damn.
He's good.
While you two guys were pussyfooting around, we rounded up a suspect.
All right, just to clarify, Gus is the only one who pussyfoots.
And in his defense, he has two bum knees and an Achilles' heel.
Two Achilles heels.
Really?
It's worse than I imagined.
And we're about to drop a humdinger on you, fellows.
Turns out old Herb was playing adult ping-pong with a 20-ish-year-old girl who works right here on the wharf.
Maybe they were friends.
Would you take the bifocals off, Tom Landry?
The man was shot execution style.
He was having an affair with a young dame.
A young dame who didn't show up to open up her shop in a few days.
I would think long and hard before I spoke again, Rick.
And you better think longer and harder and then not say squat.
That's a high percentage of thinking to not talking.
Oh, looky here, text from Jules.
They got the okay to search Herb's house.
They'll be there in about an hour.
So I guess we'll see you at Herb's house in about an hour.
See ya.
Wouldn't want to be ya.
Only 45 minutes until the search, Floyd.
Good thing, Don.
Early bird special just around the corner at Coco's.
Boone, what?
You guys can't do this.
No, this was our move.
We get here before the police and we break the rules.
Hey, we were breaking the rules before they had rules.
Oh, so you have a copyright on breaking the rules?
We don't disturb the scene.
We do our search, leave no trace.
Got it?
Yeah, thanks.
Please tell me we don't look like that when we do our thing.
That's exactly how we look.
I think there's a clue in that fish.
I think he knows that fish.
I think he thinks the fish has information about Herb's murder.
Floyd and I helped Herb catch that walleye, you germs.
Back in '82, that man could reel them in like nobody's business.
Oh, he sure could, Floyd.
"That man could reel them in like nobody's business".
Oh, look at that.
You and old Herb have the same swimsuit.
I wear a full-body Fastskin suit when I swim, Shawn.
It increases my speed, endurance and buoyancy.
No comment.
All right, I'm getting something.
A man, or men, a woman, or women, perhaps pets, possibly feline, unwelcome in this house searching high and possibly low for something that Herb Wilkins, a man of many secrets and potentially lies, was hiding.
I'm getting sick and tired of you guys accusing Herb of misbehavior.
I'm feeling like I need my billy club and something to wipe off prints.
Okay, calm down.
Maybe they're right.
But I guarantee you, whatever those perps were looking for, they did not find in this house.
Hey, Herb was the most careful, thorough man on the planet.
If there was something important, something that people were after, there is no way he would have hid it in his home.
Well, where would he have kept it?
Come here.
All right, do you remember back in the old days, when we had really, really special evidence we kept it in a secret locker?
No.
Well, I'll bet you whatever those perps were looking for is in Herb's locker.
Can we be heard that clearly when we turn around and whisper?
I sure hope not.
Why do they shake hands like that?
I do not know.
What!
That's so ridiculous.
I know where Herb's locker is.
Dude, you didn't see their car right there?
It clearly blends in with the landscaping, Gus Shh!
Just act natural.
You guys going to conduct the search with us?
Oh, I don't know.
We're thinking about it.
Later.
Be right behind you.
I am telling you guys, do not follow us.
We don't need to follow you.
I already know where Herb's super shady suspicious locker is because of this.
Did he just throw a loafer at me?
It was a Magnanni slip-on.
What?
What?
I know my loafers, Shawn, and I won't apologize for it.
Floyd, I think you're going to need your shoe.
It's not number nine, Floyd.
This is lucky number nine.
Isn't that your lucky number?
No, that's my favorite number.
You have a favorite number and a lucky number?
I don't want to get into this with you right now, Don.
Do we sound like that?
That's exactly what we sound like.
Louie Shavarino.
I told you it wasn't number nine.
Man, you didn't tell me nothing.
Guys, would you like a little help from the palm reader?
We got it under control, Rick.
Looks like all Boone has is some baby powder and a bag of pretzels.
Whoa, whoa, I think we can use that.
What kind of pretzels are those?
Snyder's of Hanover.
You get anything out of that?
Yes.
The hungries.
You can't have these.
Gentlemen, I believe we are looking for lucky locker number 22.
Floyd will break into it.
No, no, it's all right.
Gus can do it.
Oh, go ahead.
Be proud.
You can crack locks and steal things.
Typical.
For your information, I used to have an online subscription to Safe Cracking magazine.
Hey, hey, hey, you disappoint me, son.
What?
All right, look, I say this with great respect for Herb's legacy, but let's just recap, shall we?
His house was burgled, he was shot execution style, he's canoodling with some young vixen and now we believe he's throwing evidence in his secret locker.
Is it at least possible he was living a double life?
No.
No.
Nice.
No way.
There's simply no easy way to say this.
Though I don't anticipate it being difficult to say, Herb Wilkins was the oldest drug kingpin in the history of the world.
Actually, Shawn, the oldest drug kingpin is a guy named Armando I can't do this with you right now.
Maybe he was still working undercover.
Yeah.
The great cops never truly retire.
These drugs are still circumstantial.
Agreed.
But this is all starting to paint a worrisome picture.
I just got confirmation that Herb withdrew $50,000 from his savings account three days ago in cash.
Presumably to buy this surplus of nose candy.
Evidence points to a drug hit.
This is bad.
This is really bad.
All right, guys, look, this is not the man we knew.
You guys just do what you do best.
Let's get to the bottom of this.
We owe it to Herb, huh?
Detectives, we know that you are hurting right now so if you need anything, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
You really mean that?
I do.
You mind picking up my duds?
They'll be ready at 5:00 sharp.
No.
But I'll pick your teeth up off the floor if you ask me that again.
What could he possibly need dry-cleaned?
Those crafty old devils.
They swiped a book of matches from evidence.
Let's tail them.
How is it these guys beat us everywhere we go, but always drive as if we're in a school zone?
It's like we're following Richard Farnsworth in The Straight Story.
Except lawnmowers don't have turn signals.
What are they doing?
Roll them up.
It is in your best interest to stay away from us.
We're on this case, too.
You're just trying to take Herb's good name.
We're trying to catch a killer, same as you.
Same as me?
Don't you ever use the word, "same" and "me" and "you" in the same sentence again.
I didn't put me in, it was just "same" and "you".
Look, I know you swiped the matchbook from evidence.
So?
So, we were going to do that.
Just let us in on the lead.
You guys just don't know when to quit, do you?
No, Gus and I never know when to throw in the towel.
We're ready for the next round.
Ring the bell.
Ding, ding.
Boone, relax.
We don't care what Herb was up to.
Put our differences aside and work together on this.
Okay?
Between the four of us, we've got what?
Over 300 years of crime fighting under our belts.
What do you say?
We're the apples.
You're the oranges.
We got to be the same fruit.
Oh.
That feels reasonable.
So much that it's fair, actually.
How about grapples?
I do love a good grapple, Don.
Okay, it's a deal.
We're the grapples.
The Dollhouse?
What's a guy in his 70s doing visiting a nightclub that we can't even get into?
Exactly.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Nighttime.
When the place is actually open.
Ah.
The Dollhouse, 9:00.
See you.
The good news is I got plenty of time to change into my club clothes, Floyd.
You don't have club clothes, Don.
Exactly.
What!
Well, look at that.
We beat Peters and Boone to the punch and it feels good.
Yeah, it does.
Guess that means we got some time to kill.
Oh, my God.
I really hope Boone doesn't take out his gun on her.
We were right.
Yeah.
Herb was in here several times with a hot young thing named Saralyn.
Her co-dancer said that Saralyn likes to hustle cash.
I'm getting something.
Long red hair, about 20 years old.
She works at the Pacific Treasure shop over there.
Saralyn was young, a young redhead.
How'd you do that?
I'm also sensing she didn't show up to any of her shifts this week.
I bet she's the same girl that works at the Pacific Treasures shop at the wharf.
That's right.
See, that's why Herb took 50 grand out of his account.
He was being seduced and swindled by some young hussy.
But what about the bag of cocaine we found in Herb's locker?
He was probably dealing dope on the side.
That's why he had such a fat bank account.
No, no, no, no.
You just hold on.
We agreed to work with you two not more than two hours ago.
Don't make me take my shoe off again.
Whoa, Floyd, you have to relax, man.
You can't be whipping shoes at people.
It's Jules.
I got to take this.
Give me the good stuff.
We got a match on the prints we took from Herb's boat.
They're from a guy named Otto Derzius.
A suspected drug dealer we've been keeping tabs on.
All right, well, did you arrest him yet?
No.
We're on our way to get him.
He owns a nightclub called the Dollhouse.
You ever heard of it?
No.
Shawn, where are you right now?
Library.
Then what is that thumping noise?
I don't know what that is.
It must be some sort of rush at the book drop.
Shawn, I know that you are at that club.
Do not talk to Otto and do not search his office.
That is an order, and pass it along to Peters and Boone.
Copy.
Guys!
Otto's a big time drug dealer.
What?
Otto, big time drug dealer.
Who's Otto?
He's the guy that runs this club.
Hey, I bet Saralyn and this Otto scumbag are a team.
Yeah.
They swindled Herb and then killed him.
Listen, the cops are on their way down here.
We've been given strict orders not to talk to Otto or search his office.
We don't want to wait around for that.
Neither can we.
Dude, that guy looks like a Billy Zane action figure.
Yeah, he does.
I wonder how much he costs.
He's a grown ass man, Shawn, I doubt he's for sale.
Shouldn't we at least ask?
Yeah.
We're going to do a thing from the old days called bark and mark.
What's a bark and mark?
For starters you two stand here barking like yappy dogs.
That's ridiculous.
Here's what we're going to do.
We're going to start a grease fire in the men's bathroom.
Are you out of your mind?
How about we just go outside and find an open window.
Check this out.
The serial number on this gun has been filed off.
Just like the gun on the boat.
Well, what do we have here?
That's the same type of bag we saw in Herb's locker.
We better find out where Otto is.
Dude, dude!
What?
Check this out.
What!
It looks good.
It looks really good.
Hey, hey!
You guys all right?
What are you waiting for?
Come on, go get them!
Fine.
Part of me hopes we don't catch up with Otto.
All of me hopes we don't catch up with Otto.
Ow!
I pulled a hammy.
You're just saying that because you don't want to catch Otto.
Dude, we're barely jogging, we have no chance in hell of catching Otto.
I just pulled my hammy!
You can't use a fake hammy pull immediately after calling me out for using it.
No, I really pulled my ham Talk to me, Gus!
I'm okay!
All right.
Well, we caught up to Otto.
The four of you are like an incompetence machine.
You were given specific orders and you did the exact opposite.
Chief, may I say something on behalf of myself and a teeny bit of Gus?
No.
The psychic realm takes orders from no one, Chief.
When I feel, I must act and sometimes that requires bending Over.
You're right.
Carry on.
Otto Derzius.
He was our prime suspect.
He's not much good to us now.
And let me get this straight, you broke into Otto's office and what did you get?
Hmm?
Mr. Guster, tell me, what did you get?
Nothing, Chief.
We got a whole lot of nothing.
That's right.
Nothing.
What about you, Mr. Boone?
What did you get?
Menus.
Well done.
What did I tell you about the menus, Floyd?
Well, you know there are some new takeout places There's a time and a place for snatching menus.
Oh, come on, man, you're saying a man doesn't have to eat?
No, I'm not saying we don't need to eat.
Excuse me.
You're both fired.
You're off this investigation.
Them's the breaks.
Sometimes you got to make the tough decisions.
Oh, you're fired, too, Spencer.
You're all off this case.
What?
What?
No.
That's Henry?
You stay.
You know I've been fired from many jobs, Gus, many jobs.
Well, I haven't.
Most of them sat surprisingly well with me, but not this one.
I repeat this one is not sitting well.
We can still solve this case.
Oh, no, we can't.
By we, I mean us.
By us, I mean them, because us plus them equals we.
Shawn, you need to just shut it down.
No, we need to start it up.
We need to reunite with Peters and Boone.
Bring this baby home.
You know what?
I think we underestimated those guys.
Did you not see the handful of menus in Boone's hand?
Gus, we've been watching these old geezers from the start.
So?
You know damn well he took more than just menus.
Those guys are crafty.
Boone is wily.
Wait a second.
Just like the matchbooks.
Exactly.
We need to find them now.
And by we you mean us and by us you mean them.
It makes sense, Gus.
You can't think of it like numbers.
All right, listen up.
We've had our differences in the past, but we've learned two very valuable lessons from you guys.
One, it is never too early to start trimming our eyebrows.
And two, good cop instincts never die.
And one thing I know for sure about you, Boone, is that you take one thing and give to the chief, like menus.
And you take something else that we could actually use to solve this case.
Not bad, fellows.
Take it.
These are all the job applications for the girls at the Dollhouse.
I knew it!
You still have your good stuff.
That means we have Saralyn's address.
Come on, let's go search her house.
Let's track her down.
Redeem ourselves.
Fellows!
Look, I think you guys were right.
Saralyn teamed up with Otto, they swindled Herb out of his And then that vixen killed Otto because she wanted to keep all the money for herself.
What about the cocaine we found in Herb's locker?
Don't worry about that for now.
Come on, let's do this.
We can't.
Floyd and I thought we missed the cop's life, we thought we still had something left in the tank.
But we actually believed that we could help you solve Herb's murder.
Yeah, having punks smashing me in the knees with wooden bats and people spraying bullets all over the damn place.
I'd rather just play my checkers.
Oh, okay, wait a second, wait a second.
You guys are telling me that you want to quit because you got hit with a sporting good?
Well, guess what?
So do we.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.
What kind of psycho con woman killer puts down her mark as an emergency contact?
My fourth wife, Maudine.
Seriously, nobody else thinks this is weird?
Oh, no, it's definitely weird.
I don't think Saralyn killed anybody.
Guys, we have to find her.
She is the key to this case and we can't do it alone.
We need two rock solid cops by our sides.
It's like I told Gus earlier, you are us and we are you.
And you are them.
And they are you and together we are all of it, man.
We are all of it, Jack!
Okay, sometimes he doesn't make any sense.
I get what he's saying.
Really?
Thank you, Boone.
I'm not asking you to do to this for me.
God knows I'm not asking you to do it for Gus.
Do it for Herb.
It's time the four grapples got back together and cleared his good name.
We're back.
We're back.
Sweet.
You were never gone.
Well, they were gone for 20 years.
Fellows!
Cars are this way.
Hello there.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm a psychic detective.
This is my partner, Control-alt-delete.
The gentlemen on the flank are us in 30 years.
Sixty years.
Twenty years.
What do you want?
We want to talk to you about Saralyn.
The cops were just here.
I told them everything I know.
You're lying.
Okay.
Okay.
I didn't tell the cops everything.
Oh, Boone, maybe you want to relax your trigger finger.
Tuck it.
Now would you be so kind as to let us in so we can ask you a few questions?
Thank you.
How'd you know she was lying?
I'm a psychic, Peters.
How did you know she was lying?
She's a woman.
She's a woman.
Tell us everything you know about Saralyn's involvement in the murder of Herb Wilkins.
I used to work at the Dollhouse with Saralyn and she said that she needed to make some extra money, so I told her about this job that I was doing for Otto on the side.
Pacific Treasures.
Yeah.
Look, all I can tell you is that a bag would appear inside the shop a few times a month, I delivered it to Otto.
I didn't ask any questions, but my only way out of the job was to find a girl to take over for me.
Saralyn wanted to do it and it wasn't supposed to be dangerous.
You win the worst friend ever award, sweetie.
Trust me, I feel terrible.
Floyd and I helped Herb catch that Now what we're going to play is a little game called damn good chance of you getting shot.
That's the same type of bag we saw in Herb's locker.
It was salt.
The drugs came in on a boat called The Double Whammy.
No, that's not Uh, twin keys.
Mmm.
Second Wind!
That's it.
The name of the boat was the Second Wind.
The drug lord would dock at the wharf, drop the bag of loot off at Pacific Treasures and you and Saralyn were mules.
Wait a second.
We spoke to Herb's daughter, Caroline.
They haven't spoken in years.
Saralyn reminded Herb of his daughter, the one he hadn't spoken to in years.
They even had the same red hair.
Herb was trying to protect her.
That's why he took the 50 G's out of that account.
He was trying to buy her freedom.
What about the bag of coke we found in Herb's locker?
Well, when he found out what she was up to, he didn't want her to make that last delivery.
I bet the farm on that.
That's the Herb we knew.
Did you ever get a look at this drug lord?
No.
He was like a ghost.
Hey, he wasn't no ghost.
He's a man.
We're going to find him and we're going to kill him.
We're not going to kill him, Floyd.
Don't be so sure.
All right.
So what do we got?
We got We got this drug lord and Otto.
They They silence Herb to protect their operation.
Then we bring the heat on Otto, the drug lord cuts him down before he can talk.
Saralyn's the last piece of the puzzle.
Yeah, we got to find out where Saralyn is.
Can you help us out there, Jos?
I wish I could.
But she packed a bag a few days ago and took off.
It's so sad.
She was so close to a fresh start.
She was supposed to graduate from school in a few weeks.
Nursing school?
Yeah.
I know where Saralyn's hiding.
Follow us to Herb's house.
Saralyn, we know you're in there.
And we know you didn't kill anybody.
We're here to help you.
Hey, you don't come to this door, we're going to come through it.
Damn, Gus, they still got it.
Yeah, they do.
Go away.
I don't want your help.
Yes, you do.
We can protect you.
No.
People try and help me and they end up dead.
Just leave me alone.
I think we should get fresh peaches and eat them instead.
How about a churro?
You listen to me, young lady, you're in grave danger.
I know that.
Just go away.
Can I go now?
Yeah, you can go.
I'm going to be watching you.
Me, too.
I know who the drug lordlkiller is.
Okay, does anyone actually believe that Saralyn is in that house alone?
Mmm-mmm.
No.
What's the plan?
Well, we could sneak through a window and start a grease fire in the bathroom.
Do it Shawn and Gus style.
We could.
What was the bark and mark again?
What in the hell?
You better get out of here before you get yourselves shot.
Hold up!
Hold up!
We want to offer you a deal!
Send out Saralyn, take my friend, Gus.
What?
No deal!
Yeah, no deal.
Fine.
I'm calling the police.
You dial, she dies.
Okay, okay, okay.
Send her out, take Shawn instead.
Get out of here, you idiots!
Take Gus, he can pass for Omar Epps in restaurants.
Take Shawn, trust me, you'll feel better about yourself in comparison.
Where are those old timers?
I don't know.
All right, follow my lead.
Age before beauty!
You're four months older than I am.
Since when?
Since birth!
I'm going to have to shoot these morons.
Man, why you gotta bring up stuff that happened 30 years ago?
You're under arrest, punk!
Nice job, Detective.
Thank you.
Let's go!
Come on.
It's the bark and mark.
What!
Man, you think we'll still be able to knock dudes out cold when we're in our 60s?
We can't knock dudes out now.
I hear that.
Let me start by saying that everyone did an incredible job today.
And the fact that I fired all four consultants and they went ahead and pursued this case anyway is something that I'm choosing to forget.
Herb was a good man and if I were in your shoes, I would have done exactly what you guys did and never given up on this case.
Thank you, Chief.
It means a lot.
Well said.
See, I was talking to Peters and Boone.
You guys should have just stayed fired.
Nah, sis, without Rick and Gutzy here, Floyd and I would still be in the park playing checkers.
Yeah.
They were the kick in the pants we needed.
Got a hell of a kid here, Henry.
Yeah, he's all right.
Sometimes.
And then there's you.
Standing tall, shirt tucked in a little tight, maybe a little too tight.
But there's confidence in your eyes and fire in your loins.
You know, I'd be honored to take you in, Gus, if you got no parents.
That's very kind of you, Boone, but I do have parents and I'm in my 30s, so I think I'm good.
Thank God for that.
I can't be taking in no strays, Don.
I'm with you there, pal.
Rick!
Yeah.
We just got a call about a body downtown on Tremont Street.
There are signs of foul play.
Hey, whoa, whoa, you guys are the best there ever was, maybe the best there ever will be, but you do know this was a one-time deal, right?
Right, Henry.
All right.
What are you going to do with Saralyn?
I'm going to do everything I can to get leniency for her.
Herb was looking out for a good girl with potential and I will do the same.
Are they Those sneaky Holy crap.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
All right, Gus, we trained long and hard.
Hours of practice after school, all those Joe Piscopo-endorsed protein shakes.
It will all be worth it if we win that Mongoose BMX bike at the Police Department Picnic.
Yeah.
You ready?
Mmm-hmm.
Ready, set, go!
Come on!
We're almost there.
Keep it up!
Inside, outside, inside, outside!
Yes!
Yes!
A new record.
We're definitely going to win that bike.
What's up?
Oh!
Wait, how do we decide who gets the bike?
A good question.
We could do Eeny-meeny-miney-moe.
Don't insult my intelligence.
We can do Rock-paper-scissors.
Nah, too easy to cheat.
Well, we can share it.
Of course not.
Oh, I'll race you for it.
All right.
All right.
Oh!
Really?
Really?
Come on.
No, you really.
No, no, no, you really, because this is I'm going home, man.
No, no.
I'm taping your face.
Come here.
Come here!
Come here!
I'm taping your face, little boy.
Come here!
Dude, if you had told me we were boarding a ferry to the Channel Islands to do environmental cleanup, obviously I would have said no.
That's exactly what I told you.
And what did I say?
You said no.
Then why am I here?
Because you're easily distracted.
What?
When it comes to mental focus, I'm sharper Ooh!
Thanks, man.
I was starved.
You know, when they say these things really satisfy, they are not lying.
So packed Oh, man.
And done.
Check out those outfits.
Must be on work detail.
No, I mean those outfits.
You may be into the environment, Gus, but at least you're not one of those dudes.
Hey, the Guster!
What's happening?
Long time no see, man.
How you doing?
You remember my brother, don't you?
Oh, of course I do, yeah.
Okay.
Guys, this is my friend, Shawn.
He'll be volunteering with us today.
Shawn, this is Dan Carter and his brother Carl.
Hola, Shawn.
You can call me D.C. Me, C.C. No, oh.
Well, that's cute.
In order to reduce carbon emissions, you guys ask people not to use your first names?
Shawn.
You have to forgive my friend Shawn.
He's not very environmentally conscious.
It's okay, Gus, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Before you go black Al Gore on me, you should know that your sea sickness patch fell off.
Okay, first of all, black Al Gore was your Halloween costume, not mine.
And secondly, my sea sick patch is right here.
Here we go.
Let's get you to a bathroom.
Gentlemen.
It's all right, man.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Stairs.
Don't go boneless on me, Gus.
Do not go boneless.
Sick man coming through!
Move if you don't want to get sprayed on.
Come on.
Move it!
Wait, hold on.
Hey, hold on a second.
I'm sorry, you going to have to wait.
You don't understand.
My friend has the equilibrium of a bumble bee.
You got to let him in there.
No, you don't understand.
The state of California law says no one can occupy a restroom with furloughed felons, which is them, except for an armed escort, which is me.
This guy here, these guys would peel that head like a grape.
Not on my watch.
The head peel is my fourth greatest fear, Shawn.
We can wait.
Are you sure?
Mmm-hmm.
We'll wait.
Okay, I'm going to let little man go ahead.
Yeah, cool.
Come on, son.
What gives?
You didn't see him doing his little pee-pee dance.
Even they can see that.
They're felons, not animals.
What's the matter with you?
Come on, Gus, I'll take you to the other bathroom.
That should do it.
One would certainly hope so.
You heard that, right?
Yes.
Uh-oh.
Wait a second.
If the prison guard is here, then where are the convicts?
Gus, this is a prison break.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know You're not so bad now.
All right, what happened?
I don't know.
Shoot.
One minute I'm checking the stalls after they finished, the next thing I know I got a knot on my head and I'm waking up in this closet.
Dude, where is your gun?
Oh, they probably turned it in for some books at the local community center.
Where do you think it's at, man?
Listen, we need to go upstairs and tell everybody what happened.
No.
No.
No.
The last thing we need is a panic on our hands.
Man, that would put everybody in danger.
We need to call the police.
That's the sixth time you've said that today and this time I actually agree with you.
I'm going to call the bridge and inform the captain.
This is Henry Spencer.
Dad, listen up and listen carefully.
Gus and I are on a ferry for some ridiculous environmental cleanup.
Do not editorialize, Shawn.
Four prisoners on board on a work furlough.
Now they overtook their guard with relative ease and we're pretty sure they're planning an escape.
What should we do?
All right, all right, Shawn, listen to me and I want you to listen carefully.
You do not do anything.
Do you understand?
We'll coordinate with the Coast Guard and intercept the vessel.
In the meantime, I want you to stay in constant contact with me.
Look, I'll try, but cell coverage is spotty at best out here.
Then don't move.
I'll call you with our ETA.
Shawn, the worst thing you can do in these situations is take matters into your own hands.
Got it.
We're going to have to take matters into our own hands.
Are you sure that's what your dad said?
Gus, don't be the one game at Chuck E. Cheese that isn't broken.
By the time the cops arrive these prisoners will be halfway from here to the Pacific Ocean.
Halfway from here to the Pacific Ocean is the Pacific Ocean, Shawn.
What the heck is that?
Why are we stopping?
I got to the Captain.
You see, protocol says that he shuts down the engine, then he locks off the bridge, so the convicts can't get to him and hijack the ferry.
That means they're already scrambling.
But whatever they're going to do, they're going to do it soon.
Hey, man, all these dudes got at least 20 years or more.
They got nothing to lose.
They'll do anything to get off this boat.
Yeah?
Well, we're the only ones who can stop them.
Man, I guess I had you all wrong.
Hey, look, man, I owe you all an apology for the way I treated y'all back there.
I just assumed y'all was just a couple of punk ass friends from grade school that like to get theyself in different situations then riff on things at other people's expense, you know?
No.
No.
Couldn't be further from the truth.
That's the wrong tune.
I see, now y'all a couple of Gs.
I could really use y'all.
Yeah, yeah.
Craig, man.
Gus.
Shawn.
All right, so what's our play, Craig?
What did you say?
Our play.
What What's the play, Craig?
Craig, man.
Craig.
Did you see Friday?
Are you kidding me?
"Mama!
"Mama!
"Man, you just got knocked the" Really, Shawn?
We want to be used.
How can we help?
Oh, yeah.
Y'all know where we can get some supplies?
I believe we do.
Then right after that we spent three months in the Amazon Rainforest.
Amazon Rainforest.
True that.
Hey, the Guster.
Guster.
We were teaching the natives how to compost.
In hindsight, I think all they really wanted was food.
Why would you say that, Carl?
Well, they were hungry.
Psst.
What you got?
Here.
Oh, yeah, this'll work.
Ah.
Binoculars, yes.
Walkies, yes.
Binoculars, walkies, hemp rope.
Is there by chance a hemp rifle in there?
Let's not forget the armed part of armed and dangerous.
Or the John Candy part.
Shawn, what are you doing right now?
Eating a fruit roll up.
All right, Gus, we're going to split up, use the walkies to communicate.
Shawn, I want y'all to go up high, look out for anything, anything at all that would give you a clue as to these convicts' whereabouts, like passengers acting funny or scared or blacked out windows.
Anything.
Got it.
Where are you going to be?
Once y'all radio me the convicts' location, I'm going to isolate them from the civilians.
And that's when I'm going to make my move.
By yourself?
Oh, I got the Lord on my side, brother.
I admire your faith.
Oh, yeah.
Let's bounce.
There they are.
Uh, Craig, you there?
You realize you're using a radio voice?
Not to be confused with your cell phone voice or your white dude voice.
I do not have a radio voice, Shawn.
Who is this?
Gus.
This don't sound like you.
You using some kind of radio voice or something, man?
Listen, we have a visual on the suspects.
They're sneaking onto a life boat.
I'm on it.
10-4.
Cool.
Damn it.
Shawn, Gus!
They sealed off all the doors to the outer deck.
Damn.
0kay.
We'll think of something.
You ready?
Me?
Hey, if I'm going to die, you better be right behind me or I will haunt your kitchen cabinets until the day you die.
Watch the Get the hell out of here!
Hey!
No!
How was that possibly a good idea?
Sorry, prison dudes, we simply could not let you take that lifeboat.
Now you have no choice but to stay here and wait for the police to take you in.
Actually there is another choice.
Lassiter.
Tell my dad I kind of took matters into my own hands.
Okay, Mr. Northcutt, there's a way this plays out where no one, including you or your fellow inmates, gets hurt, but first and foremost, we need confirmation that the hostages are safe.
Oh, they are.
But if you want them to stay that way, then you provide us with a fully fueled boat, a GPS de-scrambler, and assure us that no one's going to follow us.
Call me back when we've got a deal.
O'Hara, do we have that intel yet?
Dane Northcutt, Sanfus Sanders, Adam George, Gabriel Appel.
Each has a multi-page rap sheet.
The crimes range from grand larceny to armed robbery.
They've been model prisoners up until now.
This work furlough was a reward for good behavior.
They're currently armed and considered very dangerous.
They all orchestrated being on work detail at the same time.
I'm willing to bet this was their plan all along.
I don't know what happened in there, but I do know this much, it was that jackass Spencer's fault.
Lassiter, not really helpful right now.
Carlton, I am sure that whatever Shawn did, it was because he felt he had no choice.
Choice 17, you could have let them get in the boat and left your phone in there to track it.
Choice 18, you could have set your mark-ass down somewhere and let me handle it.
Choice 19, we could have gotten in the boat and got away!
Everyone empty their pockets into this bag.
Hey man, hey dude!
Dude!
What?
Why don't you let the women and children and men go?
Why don't you shut up?
All right.
Come on, give it up.
Come on, give it up.
We got to do something to let them know they can trust us.
Give him the nod.
Shawn, the nod works when it's me giving it to a brother behind the counter at Jamba Juice, not an armed convict.
Look, man, we got to create an unexpected emergency.
One they ain't going to be able to handle that will throw them off and we can exploit that to break down their unity.
What kind of emergency?
I got an idea.
Does it involve a bear?
I've got a better idea.
Shawn!
Sorry.
Mommy.
Help!
Somebody!
Somebody help!
Yo!
Man down!
Man down!
Hey, hey, hey, hey What's going on here?
Y'all two got to do something or dude is going to die.
Stay with us, Gus.
Hang in there, buddy.
We losing him.
We losing him, man.
Hey, hey, hostages start dropping up in here, cops going to be all over this piece.
You two pick him up.
What the hell are we supposed to do with him?
Yeah, man, we ain't no doctors.
He's just seasick, you freaking idiots.
Just get him out of here.
Don't worry, Gus.
Here.
Here's another patch.
Okay, worry a little.
You know what?
I don't like this.
It's taking the cops way too long to respond.
Yeah, way too long.
What's the ETA on the snipers?
They're almost in position.
Yeah, well, almost isn't good enough.
Boat three in position, with the snipers.
Have all vessels clear.
That's it.
They're starting to break.
This is my chance to convince them to let us go.
All right, listen, you got to come at these guys hard if you want them to respect you.
Okay?
No silliness, no random movie references.
This is just like Collateral.
Except I'm Jamie Foxx and you're Tom Cruise.
You're Cruise.
You finished?
Oh, yeah, I'm done.
You sure?
You sure?
Because if you're not I'm done.
I promise.
No, 'cause, see, you seem to think I ain't got nothing else better to do with my time.
We're in this thing together.
Please, finish what you were saying.
Only one way for you to come off hard.
Take the last thing they said and then you repeat it back to them, you know, like, an angry question.
That doesn't make any sense.
That doesn't make any sense?
Oh, I stand corrected.
Oh, you stand corrected?
Okay, I got it.
You sure?
Yeah, yeah.
Because it's subtle.
You want to practice it?
It's not subtle.
I got it.
The two of you need to shut up right now.
I don't want to shoot you.
Oh, you don't want to shoot us?
You don't want to shoot us.
Man, how dare you say you don't want to shoot us.
All right, all right, man, just calm down.
Damn.
We told you to shut up.
Yo, we just saw the cops loading up two boats with snipers.
Damn it!
You said if we went along with you, it would all be smooth.
You didn't say anything about no snipers.
Yeah, man, he's right.
I ain't trying to die.
Look, man, you ain't the only one with a dime piece waiting for him out there.
You think I wanted this to happen?
Hey, prison dude, cops aren't playing around, okay?
I think it's time you rethink your plan.
I'm sure they'd be willing to make a deal if you show them some good faith, a gesture, you know?
Like that all the hostages are safe.
That's all they care about in these situations.
Did you see Dog Day?
You're right.
You are absolutely right.
Choice 21.
You could have used hypnosis to convince him to let us all go.
Gus, I was hoping he would release the hostages, not use us as a human shield.
This is Vick.
Yeah.
We're still working on getting you that boat.
Nice try, but it's too late.
You call off your snipers right now.
You'll see they have no clear shots.
Damn it!
They're all in the way.
Okay, Mr. Northcutt, let's just remain calm.
There is an easier way out if you just surrender now.
You listen to me!
If we're not provided that boat in 10 minutes, I'm going to start killing your hostages.
You got that?
Chief, we have to listen to them.
Two of our own are onboard.
Well, one and a half at best.
Still not helpful.
Come on, Henry, you and I both know we have a strict policy of not negotiating in situations like this.
Chief.
Make the call.
We're going in.
The boys are going hot.
Let's go!
No!
Go!
Oh, come on, man, please.
Shut up!
I voted for Obama!
Shut up!
Move!
Come on!
Just take Carl.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We're environmentalists!
Come on!
Guys, put these on!
Where are the other inmates?
You have to go down!
You have to go through the door and down!
Four!
Four prisoners on this boat.
I got four prisoners.
All right, we got them!
No!
Lassie, no!
What?
Those two aren't prisoners!
What the hell are you talking about?
They're not prisoners!
Who are they?
Um, D.C. and C.C. All right, listen up, by the time we caught up with the stolen medic boat, Northcutt and Sanders had already made their escape.
The hunt is now an inter-agency top priority, so we are coordinating everything with the Sheriff's department as well as the Coast Guard.
Your personal assignments have been sent to your inboxes.
Chief, anything on Northcutt or Sanders out of the Department of Corrections that can help us on this?
I've got something, Chief.
I'm sensing these men belong to a prison brotherhood, a small cadre if you will.
This indicates there could be an accomplice who potentially aided in the escape of Northcutt and Sanfus Sanders.
Well, at this point I'll take any lead that I can get.
Okay, Mr. Spencer, let's try to find other members if any even exist.
And the rest of you, let's get to work.
We've got an hour or two at most to catch these guys and then they're gone.
Defense.
What?
What?
What?
Hey, man, what are you doing here?
I had to come in to give my statement to Detective Lassiter.
That explains the long face.
I know dealing with Lassie can be very unpleasant.
Like crawling over broken glass or any kind of wiener surgery.
No, that's not really it.
The warden called.
He fired me.
What?
Why?
Two dangerous convicts escaped on my watch.
Oh, come on, I'm sure a snafu like that has happened at the prison before.
First time.
Ooh.
In that case Man, I'm really sorry.
I'm not.
There's no excuse for letting those men get the jump on you and putting those civilians at risk.
At the very least, you should be bleeding to death from a bullet taken while trying to stop their escape.
Come on, Lassie, there's no reason to kick a man when he's already down.
That's exactly when a man should be kicked because that's the only way he learns.
The nuns taught me that.
Wow.
Lassie, the more I learn about you, the more I'm convinced you are the Penguin.
Except lankier.
Look, I do my job and put those animals behind bars.
It was your job to keep them there.
Yeah, well, your next job is about to be that you better get up out of my face kind.
Gladly.
You reek of failure.
What?
That gay dude is right.
I am a failure.
I messed up the only job I ever had.
The only thing I know how to do is be a prison guard.
I got no other skills.
And I'm supposed to be helping my mom and dad with their medical bills.
Hey, man, look, often when one door closes, another even better door will open in the future.
Ah, whatever.
Gus and I can give you some money.
That's not the kind of door I was talking about.
Fellows, I appreciate it, but I can't take your charity.
That's not how I was raised.
I'm not talking about charity, Craig, I'm talking about giving you a job.
The truth is we need you, man.
You knew more about Northcutt and Sanders than anybody.
You help us find these guys and we will split our fee for the case.
Still not the door I was talking about.
You know, that might be cool.
All right.
Deal.
Yeah.
Craig is back.
All right.
Let's get cracking, man, to the blueberry.
I'll get my coat and meet you in the parking lot.
Man.
My man.
Yeah, brother.
Man, how's he going to fit in the car?
I don't know.
Shawn, I'm all about helping a brother out, but did you have to offer him half?
Don't worry.
We'll give him my half.
It won't cost you a cent.
Oh, so, now I'm the greedy miser?
No, we'll give him my half.
And done.
All right, cool.
Thanks, Hector.
All right, so, my man who's guarding Unit B said that Sanders and Northcutt formed the Tres Diablos five years ago with Northcutt's cellmate.
His name, Percy Dunn.
Percy Dunn?
The lightning thief.
No, that's Percy Jackson, Shawn.
Either way he could have helped them plot their escape.
Let's question him.
You ain't getting nothing out of Dunn, man.
He been dead two years.
Hmm.
Dunn.
I feel like I saw that name in one of the escapee files.
Come on, Gus, don't say things just for the sake of making noise.
No.
Here it is right here.
Lorraine Dunn, She's a volunteer GED tutor at the prison.
And guess who's been one of her regular students for the past two years?
Northcutt.
Mmm.
Mmm.
To the blue Shawn.
Berry.
I met Dane when he shared a cell with my late son, Percy.
Hmm.
Is that you and Percy there?
Yes.
I used to work at that church.
And Percy would help me clean the place after school.
We didn't make much money, but it was enough to put food on the table and keep Percy out of trouble.
It's no coincidence that when the church was boarded up, Percy started running with the gangs and we know how that ended.
Dane really helped me with my grief after Percy passed away.
The two of you got pretty close over the years.
Dane means the world to me.
Excuse me, what is the name of this drink?
It's my homemade horchata.
It's surprisingly tasty.
Gracias.
Gus, do you mind?
We're sort of in the middle of something.
Mrs. Dunn, this is muy importante.
Did Dane try to contact you after he escaped custody?
No.
He hasn't.
You know what?
I think I'll have one more glass of this delicious horchata if you don't mind.
Oh!
I just cleaned this table.
Uh, Shawn, let me holler at you for a second.
This cracker's lying.
I know, but Cracker?
It's Prison 101, Shawn.
Convicts' moms lie to protect their sons.
You heard her.
Northcutt is like her own flesh and blood.
No way he would have left town without saying goodbye.
So how do you want to handle it?
I'm a psychic detective, remember?
Not really.
Mrs. Dunn, I'm afraid you lied to us.
Now, do we need to call the police?
Because I happen to know a detective who doesn't mind roughing up older women.
Okay.
He was here.
Dane was here earlier.
What did he say?
Where's he headed?
He didn't tell me.
He just wanted to make sure I was okay and to see the room where Percy grew up, to pay his respects.
That's all.
I swear.
Gus.
Wow.
Miss Dunn isn't much of a house cleaner for someone so trigger happy with their Pledge.
Gus, Craig, I've arrived at the following two conclusions.
First, this is likely one of the largest pencils in North America.
Agreed.
And I know what Northcutt was looking for.
A key.
And he found it.
Chief, I'm sensing the key that Northcutt found in the vent is also the key to where he is going.
Pun intended.
It wasn't a pun.
You just used the same word twice.
Noted and ignored.
I just got a tip from my CI.
Two men matching the description of our suspects just hired an immigrant smuggler to get them out of the country.
It's fairly certain the vehicle being used in the job is a locally owned big rig set to leave Santa Barbara in two hours.
What is this embarrassment to law enforcement doing here?
About to kick your Ichabod-Crane-Iooking ass, that's what.
Enough, we are running short of time.
Let's go.
Come on.
Lassiter, I need you to track down ASAP every coyote that's been busted in the last six months and pull the manifest from every trucking company and independent contractor who has a rig that meets these criteria, please.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
You're so lucky she's standing there.
Mr. Guster, Mr. Spencer, just go follow the key lead.
You got it.
We on it.
Let's go, baby.
We need to access Percy Dunn's prison files.
See if there's anything in there to tell us what that key might be for.
Wow.
Craig, I have an idea, why don't you use my dad's computer?
My security code still works in the prison database.
Sweet.
Percy Dunn.
All right, it says here his last stretch was 20 years for armed robbery.
Dunn was involved in the California Federal heist of '99.
I remember reading about that.
Something about it was never solved.
I heard there was a million dollars in cash that was never recovered.
Fellows, that's it.
Dunn and Northcutt were cellmates.
Dunn knew he wasn't going to make it so he told Northcutt where he stashed the million and that is what the key's for.
But where's the key to?
Locker.
A storage room.
Safety deposit box.
Hey, guys, any new leads?
Hey you feel, mama?
Dude, really?
She a dime piece.
Dime piece?
What is that, like an invisible stop watch or a chocolate coin?
It's a hot woman, a 10.
And thank you.
Oh, yeah.
Wow.
You ain't the only one with a dime piece waiting for him out there.
Dime piece.
Northcutt has a girlfriend.
Look, I'm going to tell you boys the same thing that I told the cops, I haven't seen or heard from Dane in weeks.
Um, Shawn, could I holler at you for a minute?
She lying.
I know.
I also noticed you didn't use cracker.
I'm complicated.
Everyone empty their pockets into this bag.
Come on, give it up.
Patty!
I'm sensing that while you and Dane have had your fair share of problems in the past, recently he's tried to be a much better father to Travis.
Okay, yeah, he came through here earlier.
He was being all sweet to Travis and talking about buying us a new place in a nice new neighborhood.
He was even talking about going to church tonight.
It's no coincidence that after the church was boarded up, Percy started running with the gangs.
I know where the money is and I know what the key is for.
Thank you.
Imagine lugging around all that dough.
Do you have any idea how much a million in cash must weigh?
Seriously, do you?
It's not that much, Shawn.
It's like a 100, It probably weighs as much as a pumpkin.
Agree to disagree.
Why did you ask?
You asked me We've got to stop those guys.
No, what we need to do is call Lassie and Juliet and let them stop these guys.
There's no time.
I agree with Shawn.
We need to make our move right now.
Fine.
Everybody find something you can use as a weapon.
Shawn.
Come on.
Hurry up.
That's what you picked as a weapon?
A candle?
What?
Too waxy?
Here.
Take this.
This is the Bible.
"As for the deeds of men, by the words of your lips "I have kept from the paths of the violent".
Psalms 17:4.
What?
Now let us go forth and kick much ass.
Craig 1:1.
Come on!
Better think about that little boy of yours, Northcutt.
Gus, it worked.
It's a miracle.
No, Shawn, it's not.
I'll take that.
Craig?
I can't believe Craig turned on us like that.
Really?
That's funny, seeing as how you're the one that gave him the idea.
Excuse me?
At the police department, you told him that he should have faith that good things will happen in his life, like, oh, I don't know, finding a million dollars.
No, Shawn, I meant the kind of faith you find in the Bible.
You know, like, "faith is the substance of things hoped for".
You're not going to confuse me by switching languages.
What?
Just so you punks know, we're going to kill you.
And then we're going to get our money back from that hack.
And kill him.
Yeah.
You're not wriggling enough.
I'm wiggling as much as I can.
Wriggling, Gus.
Wriggling!
What difference does it make?
I'm doing it as much as I can.
Use your teeth to tear the tape.
I just got them cleaned.
Shawn.
We're going to have to come up with another way out of this.
I know.
What's the first thing that comes to your mind?
I'm about to die.
What's the second thing?
I'm about to die on an empty stomach.
Man, what's the third thing?
I don't know.
What do you want from me, Shawn, the cabinet?
The cabinet!
We got the drop on you!
This way.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Whoa, no, Craig!
Hey!
That's a company car!
Craig!
Damn!
Dude, if we go through those woods, we can cut him off before he hits the bottom of the drive.
The question is, do we still have our good stuff?
Of course we do.
We can do this, Shawn.
Damn right, we can.
We're the best there ever was.
What?
Shared leg first.
Syncopated breathing.
Oh, hell no!
No, no, no!
Shawn!
Shawn!
Gus!
Come on.
Oh, man, I'm so glad you two are all right.
I mean, I could never live with myself if I hurt either one of you.
Okay.
Bye.
What?
Whoa, whoa, isn't this where you're supposed to reconsider what you're doing?
Why would I do that?
Because it's wrong.
You're better than this, Craig.
I used to be.
Hell, I had a good career.
I was making around 40K a year with excellent benefits, but that's all gone now.
Hell, in this job climate I'd be lucky to land a part-time gig somewhere as a night watchman making 15.
Dude, I had no idea it was so rough out there.
Yeah, it is.
How much did we make last year?
I'm not telling you.
That's fair.
Hey, with this money I can take care of my parents, my grandparents, my aunties, my uncles, my little cousin, Brucey, and my aunt Merriam and them.
I can get these corns removed and I might even have a little left over to fulfill my lifelong dream, opening a wine bar in Bangkok.
Those seem like worthy goals, Craig.
The question you want to ask yourself, does Bangkok need another wine bar?
Seriously, Shawn?
That's the question you want to ask?
I'm concerned that the Turkish market is a little oversaturated.
Bangkok is in Thailand, Shawn.
The more important question is, Craig, do you want to throw away your entire life of doing right for this one wrong?
Think about it.
Now give me the gun, Craig.
No.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
What?
Dude, I am so proud of you.
I better call Lassie and Jules.
Gus, you and Craig make sure those guys stay put.
You got it, partner.
Yeah.
Wait, wait, wait!
Hope you enjoyed your furlough, fellas.
Because you won't be getting your next one until forever.
Yeah, um, probably not a good idea to taunt violent criminals, fellas.
You never know, they might escape, you know, get out some day and believe me, they hold grudges.
Excuse the sarcasm.
Just kidding.
Little joke.
Messing around with you guys.
Hey, listen, I'm really sorry.
I lost my head back there at the church.
We probably can't be friends after what I've done, but I hope you forgive me.
Listen, Craig, everyone makes mistakes.
That's what makes us human.
The important thing is that in the end, you made the right choice.
Sounds like the wrap up to a Scooby-Doo episode.
I know.
I didn't really Just to prove to you that we do not hold grudges, we are still going to split our fee with you.
I really appreciate that.
I mean, especially since I'm the one that owes you.
I know.
That's right.
Hey, sounds like things got a little hairy down at the church.
What exactly happened?
Well, Northcutt and Sanders there got the drop on Gus and I, which is rare.
Mmm-hmm.
But luckily, Craig was there to save the day.
It was pretty cut and dry.
Well, great job, Officer.
And I'll have you know I've already spoken to the warden and in light of your actions today, I think there's an excellent chance that you're going to get your job back.
Boom.
What?
See?
I told you things work out if you just have a little faith.
And there's more good news.
There's a $100,000 reward for returning the stolen money from the Cal Fed robbery.
What?
So, congratulations again, Craig.
Oh, it's Craig.
Craig.
Okay.
Hercules!
Hercules!
Hercules!
Dude, that's awesome!
Oh, wow!
I told you.
Gus, you were so right.
You see what I'm saying?
This turned out better than I could have ever imagined.
A hundred Gs.
Okay.
Whoo.
Bye.
Take care, man.
Wait a minute.
Isn't he forgetting something?
The part about how he owes us.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Craig!
No, no, no.
No, no!
Craig!
Craig!
Dude, we got a postcard from Craig.
Oh, I guess you were wrong about the Bangkok wine bar market.
You know, technically half of that wine bar is ours.
We should go over there and claim it.
Except we can't afford the airfare because you gave away half our fee.
It was for a worthy cause.
Speaking of a worthy cause.
There's another environmental cleanup on the island this afternoon.
Gus, I will tell you exactly the same thing I told you last time.
No.
Cool.
I get it.
Thanks, man, I'm starving.
It's so easy.
Packed with peanuts!
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Oh!
Yes!
Uh-huh!
Uh-huh!
I cannot be defeated!
Who else wants some?
I do.
Why can't I ever beat him?
Because you've got no game, Gus.
I'd stick to tapping.
Ball up.
All right, Shawn, first one to 11 wins.
How much are you spotting me?
Nothing.
Winners don't need spots.
You know what they need?
Steroids!
Nobody's using that stuff, Gus, that's just a rumor.
I'll tell you what they need, Shawn, they need to believe that they can be victorious no matter how tough the challenge.
Now Start believing.
Get that weak-ass crap out of my face.
This is my house!
Technically, it's the bank's.
You're never going to improve in life if you keep competing with people who stink.
No offense, Gus.
None taken.
You got to challenge yourself.
If you don't, complacency sets in.
And bad things happen when we become complacent.
"'lf you tell anyone my secret, Eden, "'My career will be over.
"'We will be over, ' said Chase.
"Eden replied, 'I'd die before I'd tell anyone you're a shape-shifter, Doctor.
' "If only Eden knew how prophetic those words would be".
End of disk five of Internity.
Look, there's a reason those books have sold almost 30 million copies, Gus.
Mostly to teenage girls.
And adult males who enjoy reading stories about vampire doctors and their dysfunctional dating lives.
You're one to talk, Mr. "I bought Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!
on DVD".
There were 15 deleted scenes, Shawn.
Fifteen.
You said you were going to the office last night to catch up on work.
Which I did.
Then I saw those beers in the fridge.
Our fridge doesn't work.
Yes, but 7-Eleven's does.
It is there that I saw the Internity audio books for sale and decided the paperwork would have to wait.
Hey, how did your date go with that chick who spells her name weird?
Her name is Kim and she spells it K-l-M.
Which is just obnoxious.
It's like if I was Shawn with three Ss.
You're just jealous because I'm in a relationship.
Please, you've known her for six days.
Which have been pure magic.
You know when you just know?
Great.
You guys.
Well, good morning to you, too, Minka.
Mmm-hmm.
Gus will have his usual.
Six chocolate chip muffins and a chocolate milk.
Extra chocolatey.
And I'll take a baked good that I will be choosing momentarily and a latte that your fine establishment will be paying for once I nail the trivia question that you put on that board, just like I do every morning.
Oh, except this one.
I'm afraid your confidence reeks falser than your boyfriend's ID which, FYI, I saw taped to the counter at 7-Eleven.
Good luck to you.
Wait until you get a chance to meet Kim at the wedding on Saturday.
You are going to love her.
If you think that I'm going to be a third wheel to you and Kim with one "I," then you're nuts.
I'm bringing my own date.
Who?
I'll give you a hint.
It rhymes with Gooliet.
Juliet?
You nailed it on the first guess.
That's tight.
When did you ask her?
I haven't yet.
I'm not worried.
It's a lock, she'll say yes.
How do you know?
A, she has no plans that night.
B, there's always been a sort of unspoken, sometimes spoken, thing between the two of us.
And four, I happen to know she loves spontaneity.
You know why?
Because I can read women.
And she used to have that on her Facebook page.
Which I read.
Uh, I think it's time to roll the dice.
Order's ready.
And so is today's question.
"How many times is the F-Bomb used in The Usual Suspects"?
Ooh, Minka, taking things up a notch.
That might actually require some coffee.
Yeah, ah, ah.
No googling.
Don't insult my intelligence.
Shawn.
Ninety-seven.
I actually believe it's 98.
Fenster dropped one after that line-up scene.
Often gets mistaken for the word "Gug".
Which isn't even a word, but let's be honest, it should be.
What's happening right here?
He's right.
It's 98.
What?
Uh What can I get you?
It's on the house.
Oh, I'm actually good.
I just came in to use your recycling bin.
Uh Who the gug is that guy?
That'll be 14.95.
I'm still annoyed, Gus.
Who cares about the question?
I can't believe we're working on the lord's day.
And Sunday for that matter.
Sunday is the lord's day, Shawn.
Lassie, I didn't know you were playing golf today.
I wasn't.
Jules, what have we got?
Lucy Friedman, found dead on her blanket after the philharmonic last night.
But she wasn't discovered until this morning.
We don't know the cause yet.
I do.
Boredom.
I love the philharmonic.
Oh, me, too.
I'm just kidding.
Not.
Stop trying to singlehandedly bring "Not" back into vogue.
Okay.
Not.
I'm also going to bring back, "Said the liar".
That one is even dumber.
Said the liar.
There's no visible marks or signs of struggle.
Doesn't look like foul play to me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lassie, the psychic gods disagree.
I'm sensing that there's a direct link between this poor woman's death and the deaths of a Peter Hodges and a Veronica Miller earlier this week.
And what link would that be?
All three died within close proximity of an aerosol can.
All right, who are you?
And why do you keep stealing my moments?
I'm sorry, I'm Declan Rand.
Criminal profiler.
Right.
Chief Vick said you'd be stopping by.
I'm Detective Carlton Lassiter.
This is my partner Juliet O'Hara and, eh.
Criminal profiler, huh?
Sounds like one of those job titles that only exists in cheesy TV shows.
No argument here.
What is it that you do?
I'm a psychic detective.
You know what, he's right about the aerosol cans.
Hodges died holding a thing of vinyl protectant, and Miller was found within feet of a can of hairspray.
So you're saying this is a serial killer?
Well, the consistencies at each scene combined with the close timing of the deaths certainly makes it a possibility.
Definitely recommend checking the contents of those cans.
I'll make the call.
Thanks for the tip.
Oh, no, it's my pleasure, Detective.
Wow.
Come here.
Why don't I like this guy?
I don't know, maybe because he keeps stealing your thunder.
Because his name is Declan.
Don't you find that utterly ridiculous?
No.
That's because your name's Burton.
Can we get out of here?
Not until I ask Jules to be my date to the wedding Now is not the time.
Why not?
Well, for starters, there's a dead body 10 yards away.
Don't be so old-fashioned.
Jules!
May I have a word?
Yeah, what's up?
Well, I know this is totally short notice, but I was wondering if, uh, you'd like to be my date to a friend's wedding on Saturday.
Are you asking me out next to a dead person?
Told you.
Yes.
But I thought it would be okay since it doesn't really smell.
Saturday, I'd love to Fantastic.
But I literally just made plans with someone else.
What?
Who?
Come on.
But if I had known No.
That's fine.
O'Hara, need you over here.
Okay.
Um, well, we should talk about this later, yeah?
Yes.
Later.
I really don't like the cut of that guy's jib, Gus.
Something about him.
What is it?
Let's see, smart, knowledgeable of film, crime-solving machine.
He's Shawn 2.0.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I don't understand why you're giving Declan all the credit for coming up with the fact that there was poison in those cans when you know I had the exact same take.
So why didn't you say anything?
Because he beat me to the punch, Gus.
Just like with Juliet and the trivia question.
You're a big fat person.
No, I'm not.
I know.
I was trying to get you back for making me feel bad.
Shawn, hey.
Hey, Jules.
Why are you talking like that?
Sometimes he over enunciates when he gets uncomfortable.
I do not.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
Um Listen, about yesterday You know I was thinking about it and I barely know Declan.
I will reschedule with him if you really need a date to this wedding.
No, no, no, Jules, I don't need a date.
I only asked you that because I thought you might be looking for something to do this weekend.
You know?
Finding another date would be no problem.
Trust me.
Oh, good.
I'm glad.
Yeah.
Did you hear that?
Every ill-conceived word.
Now I have to find a date to this thing.
Yeah, you do.
Okay, listen up.
If you haven't heard already, we have a potential serial killer on the loose who has poisoned three victims within five days.
Now your department heads will brief you on the specifics, but what you need to know right now is that every officer here is on this case.
All precinct resources will be made available to you, including outside consultants.
Specifically, we'll be bringing in Psych because of their experience working with serial killers.
We help them write and produce one-act plays on the weekends.
They're usually very dark.
We're also hiring Declan Rand.
Hello.
Hello.
Highly trained criminal profiler, who also brought us our first big break in the case.
You've got to be kidding me.
He's going to share with us his initial profile of the suspect.
We will not have another serial killer loose on our streets.
Thank you.
Thank you, Karen.
Now, each of the victims was killed by hemlock, a poison that, in addition to being a lot of fun to say, don't take my word for it Hemlock.
Works by slowly shutting down the immune system, creating an almost peaceful death.
Hemlock.
And given that the victims were all over the age of 60 and suffering from major illnesses, I believe our killer could have euthanistic intentions.
You mean, like, mercy killings?
Exactly.
And it's my estimation they were committed by a female in her mid-30s.
Most likely suffering from an overwhelming compassionate side.
I know who it is.
Who?
Alicia Silverstone.
By the way, Declan, her first role was in the movie, The Crush.
Actually, that was her second role.
She first did an uncredited appearance on The Wonder Years.
She did.
He's right.
He's good.
Hemlock.
Okay, now that we've got that all cleared up, let's go out there and get this guy Or girl.
Can I?
What are you doing, Shawn?
First, you hired two geriatric cops.
Fine.
Now you bring in this hacky profiler with the world's worst name and the most impossibly dark eyelashes on any man ever.
Hemlock.
Stop it.
When are you going to realize that Gus and I are all you need?
All right, first of all, I agree about the name.
But this guy is not a hack, Shawn.
I have got glowing recommendations from two different chiefs of police.
Check out his resume.
He has a masters in psychology and criminology from Harvard and an MBA.
Get out of here, he's got a monkey basketball league?
Shawn, this guy is good.
I hope you're up to the challenge.
What are you talking about?
Oh, come on, kid, let's face it, you've been sloppy lately.
You're showing up at crime scenes after a late night out.
Or in.
And you mailed in the last case I gave you.
Literally.
My email was down.
Besides, I was right, wasn't I?
It doesn't matter.
How does that not matter?
The point is, if you want to hang with this guy, you're going to have to up your game.
Please.
Declan Rand can't touch my game.
You know why?
Because it's on fire, and it's covered with those little things that porcupines have.
Quills.
You watch while I smoke this arrogant fool.
Hey.
Guys, I just want to say I am blown away by the number of cases you've solved over the years.
I just looked it up.
It's an honor and a pleasure to be working with both of you.
Someone likes themselves.
Thanks, Declan.
Yeah, man, I got to be honest, I'm just not a big believer in the ability to psychologically profile a complete stranger.
Well, I respect that, but I do it successfully all the time.
Really?
Try me.
I'd really prefer not to.
Because you can't.
Well, the truth is that You're not able.
You're highly intelligent, but you're shameful of that fact, so you play it down for the use of inappropriate behavior, and you live in fear of showing weakness so you hide behind a constant barrage of jokes and sarcasm.
I agree.
Not.
Said the liar.
Not sure if those two go together.
"Said the liar," cancels "Not," out.
So does your face.
What else?
I notice you overly enunciate words at times, which I suspect is some kind of nervous reaction to confrontation or awkwardness.
Yeah.
Couldn't be further off.
Well, I tried.
Take care.
He wasn't off.
I know.
As you can see, we have the body of our victim from the park right here, and right here, we have Ms. Miller and Mr. Hodges.
What about that one?
Oh, that's a photo my 15-year-old daughter's taken for her photography class.
Is that person you?
Very observant, yes.
Yeah, it's just amazing what, really, a little ketchup and baby powder can do.
Anyway, I think that I agree with Declan's theory that these are all mercy killings.
What?
Look, Woody, we're just Looking for the facts here.
Since when?
You see, each of these victims was suffering from a life threatening disease, cirrhosis and advanced hepatitis, respectively.
And Mrs. Friedman here was suffering from Wilson's disease.
Wilson's disease?
"'Your patient dying of Wilson's disease "'is going to get a liver from the donor list, ' exclaimed Chase.
"Eden was ecstatic.
"'But if I do the surgery, the blood loss will be enormous, "'because I will most likely drink half of it.
' "Eden was in a bind".
Yeah, she was.
You are never allowed to mock me for listening to those books again.
I'm getting something.
What is it?
Those were not mercy killings.
I don't know what in Sam's hell this has to do with a transplant list, but I'm fairly certain it's a waste of time.
Um, I say we trust Shawn's instincts on this one.
Said the liar.
He was supporting you.
Really?
Guess I jumped the gun.
Excuse me, Detective?
I believe this is what you were asking for.
It's a list of all of the people in the area waiting for a liver transplant.
Crap.
What?
Look at the first three names.
"Peter Hodges, Veronica Miller, Lucy Friedman".
Someone could be killing people off to move up the list.
Exactly.
Nice try, though, buddy.
Just out of curiosity, who's the next person in line?
"Catherine Bicks".
Age?
Thirty-five.
She totally matches your profile.
Well done, Declan.
"Well done, Declan"?
Since when do you use first names?
We need to track this girl down.
Hey, I'm the one that came up with the list thing.
Good work, Shawn.
Shut up, Declan.
Krista, hey, Shawn Spencer here.
Yes, I am the one who took you to that Dodgers game.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, back up, I did not run onto the field.
I merely took a few steps to follow a foul ball.
I ended up in center field after it ricocheted off a divider where I proceeded to make like Billy "White Shoes" Johnson.
I realize that reference is lost on you.
What are you doing on Saturday?
Hello?
Please tell me you did not sleep here again last night.
Nope.
I got here half an hour ago to get stuff done.
What?
Tried to make some joe but our coffeemaker's busted.
We don't have a coffeemaker.
What was I fiddling with for the last half hour?
What is all that?
This?
This right here?
This is research I dug up on all the people that make up the transplant list.
Hmm.
I got to say, Shawn, this is pretty impressive.
Mmm-hmm.
I guess your dad should hire ringers more often.
Trust me on this, Declan is no ringer.
Once I prove that the killer is someone on this list not named Catherine Bicks, everyone, including Juliet, will realize that.
Okay, I get it, so you figured if you can win this case, then you'll win Juliet.
No.
But if making Declan look sucky somehow diminishes his appeal in Juliet's eyes, I'll take it.
Look, Gus, this isn't personal.
You do realize everything you just said is the definition of personal, right?
Not.
Hello, Dad.
Catherine Bicks was spotted entering her house about an hour ago.
You two have to get over there immediately.
Shawn?
Are you listening to me?
My humidifier looks nothing like a coffeemaker.
I'll buy you a new one.
To Catherine, she was justified in killing the people ahead of her on that list because, unlike them, she has her entire life ahead of her.
We call it sociopathic rationalization.
Oh, I find that stuff fascinating.
Me, too.
Don't say, "Not".
None of those stupid expressions are coming back.
That's what they said about Hammer pants.
Which never came back.
Then why did I just buy three pair?
Because you're an idiot.
Because it's Hammertime.
It's never Hammertime, Shawn.
I dare you to tell Hammer that.
Can I help you?
Catherine Bicks?
We'd like to ask you a few questions about a recent string of murders in this area.
Wow.
Okay.
Come on in.
I'm not a suspect, am I?
I don't know.
Should you be?
What?
Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but I just need Ma'am, please keep your hands where I can see them.
No, I just need to grab Put your hands in the air now!
Catherine, hi.
I'm sensing that you recently spent some time in Switzerland, is that correct?
Yeah.
I was visiting my liver specialist there.
Mmm-hmm.
Good two weeks or so.
Two and a half.
You can prove that.
My My passport's in my purse.
That's what I was reaching for before he pulled his giant gun out at me.
It's stamped.
Catherine, I am so sorry.
You have yourself a great day, okay?
Oops.
You play softball.
I play.
Feels fun.
This is probably a weird time to ask, but do you have plans on Saturday?
You sure we don't want to ask her more questions?
She was the precise match of my profile.
Your profile can kiss my big, round, white dumper, Declan.
I do not enjoy pointing my gun at innocent women.
You don't?
No.
I'm not 29 anymore.
It was a good effort, Declan.
I guess we should check the next person on the transplant list.
Yeah.
That is a Leonard Jimenez.
He lives at That's 10 minutes from here.
Let's go.
Gus and I will meet you there.
Why the hell are we at a hotel?
Because Leonard Jimenez died of liver cancer three days ago.
I learned that in my research this morning.
So why didn't you tell that to Lassiter and Juliet?
Must have slipped my mind, Gus.
Look, in the hour or so it takes them to put it together, I figure we'll bust the next person on the list, who I know is the real killer.
And Declan can't swoop in and steal my thunder, like the little thunder stealer he is.
You are an unbelievable person.
Who is the next person on this list?
That guy.
Everyone here has a handful of stories about ole Fitzy.
I know I have about three handfuls which doesn't make any sense.
Fitz looks scary, Gus.
That doesn't mean he's guilty, Shawn.
Are you looking at him?
Yes.
Pure evil.
Strong enough to overwhelm any one of our victims.
Plus, he has an arrest record and we've gone on far less.
Well, how do you plan on apprehending him?
It's not like we have guns.
No.
No, but I have this.
What are you going to do?
Check his reflexes?
It was the only weapon-like thing you had in the car.
Well, you better do something because we're not being very discrete.
You're indiscrete.
And he's one of the kindest, most generous souls we've ever come across.
I have a different kind of story about Fitz.
Do you mind, Donny?
My name's Greg.
One of illness, both mental and physical.
And unrelenting greed.
On the outside, he may look warm, kind and like the coach from White Shadow.
But on the inside is a cold, dark soul capable of taking the lives of others in order to save his own.
I'm afraid, members of the Joba Society, that your Fitzy Uh-oh.
Is a cold blooded murderer.
That's not Fitzy.
Who's Fitzy?
You embarrassed a well-respected, not to mention seriously ill member of our society, Shawn, at his own award ceremony.
Who had an arrest record.
It involved a peaceful protest in the '60s.
That was not specified in the Google info I received.
Plus, the fact that you lied to us.
It was a lie of omission, Lassie, there's a difference.
Come on.
We made a mistake.
We?
You're right, Gus made a mistake.
Look.
It doesn't make any sense to dwell on mistakes when there's a murderer on the loose.
You don't hear me bringing up Declan's erroneous profile that resulted in Lassiter scaring the crap out of an innocent woman.
I appreciate that.
All right, listen up, we got a big break.
We just had a man who came forward who claims to have witnessed a stranger switching Lucy Friedman's insect repellent last night.
Let me guess.
He was homeless.
Yes.
Well done.
He just sat with our sketch artist, and I believe we have the first look at our suspect.
That kind of looks like Catherine Bicks.
Damn it.
We had her.
You had her and you just walked away without any further questions?
I pulled my gun on her.
She had a stamped passport that said she'd been out of the country for two weeks.
Clearly it was a phony.
No wonder she refused police protection.
Come on, people.
That was good work, Declan.
Thank you.
Thank you, Chief.
Yes.
Good work, Declan.
We never should have doubted you.
Gug.
No, it is.
It's going to be a blast and white.
Okay.
Look forward to seeing you, too, Gina.
Bye-bye.
You did not just invite crazy Gina Rapach back to that wedding?
Look, dude, I didn't have a choice.
The last girls I asked are either out of the country, recently married, or wanted for poisoning people.
When was the last time you even spoke to her?
Mmm-mmm, I guess the night I was shot.
Gina is not the kind of girl to be messing with, Shawn.
She is obsessed with you.
Would you relax?
It's fine.
She knows we're only friends.
It's a one-off.
He's going to marry me.
Any luck?
No.
Looks like she took off about an hour ago.
She could be halfway to China by now.
That puts her somewhere outside of Vegas.
Mmm, I'm betting she's still close by.
Why is that?
This isn't a person driven by fear or any emotion, for that matter.
I strongly suspect she's suffering from a major depersonalization disorder.
Where have I heard that term before?
DPD?
No.
Depersonalization thing.
It's a disorder characterized by feeling detached from one's own mental or emotional process.
Catherine's currently going through the motions of life without actually experiencing them.
"Chase suffers from Depersonalization Disorder, "characterized by feeling detached from one's mental or emotional process.
"He's currently going through the motions of life without experiencing them.
"It's as if he were a character in a movie".
It's as if she were a character in a movie.
Therefore, I anticipate her next move to be more logical than emotional.
Do you, Declan?
You got it.
Chief wants us to regroup back at the station at 4:00.
All right.
Let's break till then.
Great.
See you guys there.
Not if we see you first, buddy.
What do you got?
Three things.
One, I'm not the only closet chick-lit lover around here.
Two, Declan's a complete fraud.
And "H," he may just be our murderer.
While you were annoyingly talking to Kim for the ninth time today, I was on the phone with Harvard who said that there is no record of Declan going there.
So the guy lied on his resume.
If that makes someone a killer, then you're Ted Bundy.
Look, Gus, this isn't about me.
Or the fact that I wasn't really a background dancer in the Thriller video.
This is about Declan, a crazy serial killer who targeted the people on that list because he knew someone else would look guilty.
This guy is pretending to be a criminal profiler so that he can steer us in that direction.
But you were the one who figured out they were all in need of a liver.
Oh, now you want to admit that.
Declan had the same information that I did.
He just let me get there first.
I know this man because he also listened to Internity.
Or read.
I just said he didn't go to Harvard, Gus.
I don't know, Shawn, maybe you have a thing against profilers.
He's guilty.
All right?
And for the record, Lassie agrees.
I ran the theory by him.
Why would you consult Lassie?
Because unlike you and Jules, he's not smitten with this guy.
I'm not smitten.
You're Jimmy Smitten.
Trust me, Gus.
Everything you think you know about this guy is a lie.
Where the heck is he going?
Once again, we're on the verge of trying to apprehend a potential killer without a weapon.
Don't worry.
I came prepared this time.
Hello, Declan.
Hey, guys.
Welcome to the barbeque I didn't know I was throwing.
Come on in.
Sweet place.
Whose is it, Declan?
If Declan's even your real name.
If it's not, by the way, you made a ridiculous choice.
It's mine.
Right.
Did you pay for it with all your profiler money?
I think he's telling the truth, Shawn.
Come on, Gus.
What about this place could possibly make you say that?
Other than the giant portrait of him hanging on the wall behind me now.
Holy crap, you're rich, huh?
Filthy, actually.
Sorry, that's a crass way of putting it.
I'm seriously loaded.
That painting kind of makes you look like John Stamos.
Thank you.
When do you plan on dropping that grill fork?
As soon as you agree to tell us your real story.
Fair enough.
Walk with me, gentlemen.
So about six years ago, I was running a small hedge fund, and I just decided to make a bunch of bets against the housing market.
A few months later, bam, they're backing a truck up to my house.
Everybody wants to rule the Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Why is there a man who looks exactly like Curt Smith from Tears for Fears playing an acoustic set next to that tree and your swimming pool?
I'm sorry.
I should have introduced you.
Curt, meet Shawn and Gus.
Afternoon, gentlemen.
Oh, dear God, it's you.
The real you.
The fleshy you.
I love you.
Do you have any idea how much I love you?
I think I do now.
Yeah, I flew Curt in to play a party I was throwing this past weekend, but he just decided to stay a few extra days because we really hit it off.
And he's paying me.
Yeah, but it's mostly because we enjoy hanging, right?
It's been a ball of fun.
You are paying me, right?
Yes.
Well, because Mad World.
Mad World.
All around me are familiar I was saying it gets a little lonely around here.
Anyway, so there I was in my late 30s, never having to worry about money again, so I decided to pursue a childhood dream.
Criminal profiler?
No.
Sushi chef.
But the whole seven year thing, it was just too much.
So then I thought how cool would it be to solve crime all day?
And I knew all the stuff about psychology because my dad used to be a therapist.
Sounds familiar.
So I fudged a few qualifications and I gave it a shot, and it turns out I have a gift.
He had a gift for Curt, please, what did I say about going off book?
And I find it kind of funny I find it kind of sad Listen, you guys aren't going to tell Chief Vick, are you?
No, but you better damn well tell Juliet.
She's into you.
Cool, yeah, I'm into her.
She's awesome, but if I tell her, my career could be over and what would I have left?
Millions and millions of dollars.
What's your plan exactly?
Just keep dating Juliet and keep the fact that you're a complete phony secret?
Isn't that your plan?
We're not talking about me now.
I really hadn't thought it out that far.
Let me help you out.
She's not the kind of girl you mess with, all right?
She's the real deal.
You either tell her you're a fake criminal profiler or I will.
You do that, then I'll be forced to tell her you're not a real psychic.
A dramatic pause, really?
Come on, Curt, that's beneath you, man.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, come on, Shawn, I've been onto you since the beginning.
Don't forget we read the same books.
They have the same taste in Curt, for Christ's sake, I say one thing, you do the other.
Don't sweat it, I still love you.
Could you just stop saying you love me?
Done.
And done.
I do, though.
Love you, that is.
Shawn?
What?
I love Curt Smith, and I don't care who knows.
I will sing it from the rooftops, Gus.
Everybody wants to rule the world Dad, you've got to fire this guy.
He is a fraud.
So are you.
Yeah, but I'm a productive one.
So is he.
And he knows Tears for Fears.
Half.
He knows half of Tears for Fears, the half that I love.
The half that I would do anything Shawn!
All right, look, Shawn, I can't just fire him.
There are no legal requirements one needs to call themselves a criminal profiler.
Look, Dad, if this was about lighting a fire under me, it worked.
Okay?
He gets results.
Now why don't you quit complaining to me, get your ass out there, like Declan, and start tracking down our murderer.
You're loving this, aren't you?
They just spotted Catherine Bicks walking through a parking garage.
Ah!
Uh-oh.
You were right, Spencer.
Declan Rand, you're under the arrest for the murder of Catherine Bicks.
You, take this joker down to Interrogation Room A. Yep.
I always knew he was a no good murderer.
Shawn, you know very well he didn't do it.
Fine.
I was wrong.
Probably.
Best kind of wrong.
The kind that makes you feel good about yourself.
What, Gus?
What do you want me to do?
Help prove his innocence.
All right.
Starting Sunday after the wedding.
Shawn.
Okay.
Lassie.
What?
Before you start your legally questionable interrogation techniques, may we have five minutes with Declan?
All right, you got five minutes, but then you tell him I'm coming, and hell's coming with me.
All right, Wyatt.
Hey.
Guys, I am so glad you're here.
Will you do me a huge favor?
Will you check in on Curt and make sure he isn't throwing a bender?
Because I think he and that dude from Crowded House, I think they're plotting something.
Neil Finn?
There's no way we're missing that.
What happened in that garage?
I don't know.
I heard on the police radio Catherine was spotted there, and I wanted to be there first to show you up a little.
And then I arrived to find her laying dead.
But why would the police think I was the murderer?
Hmm.
That is not important right now.
Do you have any idea who else it may have been?
I wish.
There's no pattern to the murders anymore.
The first three were poisoned, and Catherine died from a blow to the head.
Yeah, that's weird.
Yeah.
And get this, Catherine almost appeared healthier than she did when we first saw her.
You know, minus the whole dead thing.
I've got something.
Oh, come on, Shawn, it's just us.
There's no need for this anymore.
Seriously?
You're challenging me right now?
I'm trying to help you.
I just thought it was ridiculous.
So is your face.
Right.
Sorry.
What did you get?
Stay tuned.
Come on, Gus, let's go have a conversation with our favorite weirdo.
I don't know how you do it, Shawn, but you were spot on.
About what?
A lot of things.
My wife, for example, wasn't just friends with that college freshman, and Catherine here wasn't suffering from cirrhosis of the liver.
In fact, prior to the head trauma that ended her life, she was the model of health.
She applied makeup under her eyes the day that we saw her in order to appear sick.
Why?
Same reason a middle-aged woman sleeps with the star lacrosse player.
Those are completely unrelated, Woody.
And better yet, why would she want to get on the list for a new liver when hers was perfectly healthy?
How'd she get on it is a better question.
There's an intense screening process one has to go through.
There is no way someone that healthy would get that far.
Woody, is she a lefty or righty?
Oh, well, definitely a righty.
Muscles in that arm are much more developed.
It wasn't Catherine in the photo.
Who uses the parking garage where she was killed?
An apartment complex.
Why?
I'll tell you on the way.
Your wife's also sleeping with her personal trainer.
Yeah, it's okay.
I approved that one.
I'm sensing the killer's in Apartment 5.
You positive about this?
Absolutely.
Open up.
You better be right about this, Spencer.
Put your hands up.
Put your hands in the air.
Put them up!
Catherine?
What the hell is going on?
Not Catherine.
This is Maddy.
Her sister.
Exactly.
See, Maddy is the one with the severe liver problems.
But she can't qualify for a transplant list on account of her alcoholism.
I'm not an alcoholic.
Clearly.
My apologies.
So she and Catherine hatched a plan.
Maddy took her sister's ID to a doctor so she could get put on the list.
As Catherine.
Now all she had to do was wait for her number to be called and her life would be saved.
But Maddy was getting sicker and more impatient.
When Catherine left the country, she decided to start killing people on the list above her so that she could move up.
They had all lived long lives.
Not the most sympathetic defense.
Catherine got home, found out what she was doing, she confronted you in that parking garage.
You have got to go to the cops.
We are not going to the cops, and if you think we are You're so selfish!
I will not let you!
And in a rage, you pushed her down, she banged her head, she died.
Catherine?
I don't know what happened.
You pushed her down, she banged her head Shawn.
A common side effect of severe liver failure is psychosis.
She probably doesn't even know what she's doing.
I owe you huge.
No, I mean, huge, Shawn.
And as a token of my appreciation, I'm going to loan out Curt Smith for your buddy's wedding.
What?
Don't play with me.
Fair warning, though, he's an angry drunk.
I mean who throws a keytar into a Jacuzzi.
Oh, that's money.
Listen.
I've been thinking about what you were saying about Juliet.
And it's silly for anyone to keep a giant secret about themselves from someone they could potentially fall for, you know?
I do, actually.
So I'm going to come clean.
Really?
Because I was thinking about doing the same thing.
Really?
Yeah, I was thinking maybe it's time.
Time for what?
Jules.
Uh Here's the thing.
Will you take a walk with me?
Can you give us a sec?
I'm a fraud.
What?
Yeah, I don't have any fancy degrees from Harvard or years of experience as a profiler.
I'm just a guy with a little knowledge of psychology and a love for catching bad guys.
This whole persona I'm putting on, it's a complete fake.
I just thought it was important to tell you this because you strike me as the kind of person who appreciates honesty.
Wow.
I don't know what to say.
Well, let's talk about it.
Or not.
Well, that didn't go very well, did it, Shawn?
Shh.
Give me one second, Declan.
Just one second here.
Done.
This is actually the first time that I'm glad you beat me to the punch.
I can't thank you enough, man.
Well, you'll get other opportunities to talk to her.
Me, not so much.
Listen, Declan, you're right about one thing.
There's nothing I value more than honesty, and it does really bother me that you would lie like that.
But I'm also just blown away that you could be just so forthcoming.
Took a lot of guts.
Should we talk it out over coffee?
I don't think so.
No.
Sure.
But if you're sitting on any other life secrets, now is the time to tell me.
Okay.
I'm really rich.
Okay, I can deal with that.
So glad we almost made it So Wow.
Curt's really losing it.
Blah, blah, blah, blah Wants to rule the World.
Gus!
There you are.
You missed the entire ceremony.
Where's Kim?
Man, we broke up.
What?
You're kidding me?
What happened?
I don't know.
We were out having a nice lunch today when out of nowhere she goes, "It's like we don't know each other anymore".
That's because as of a week ago, you didn't.
Man, this sucks.
I can't believe I'm single again.
You know who can?
Anyone who met you eight days ago.
How about showing some compassion, Shawn?
Absolutely not.
That whole thing was absurd.
You're a ridiculous person.
You're a ridiculous person.
How about that?
What's the latest with Gina?
Has she tried to kill you yet for uninviting her to this wedding?
No.
Because I came up with a fix.
This buffet is so good.
Hi, Gus.
Hello, Gina.
You have problems.
Help me.
You've got to try the bruschetta, Shawn, seriously.
I'd really prefer not to.
Oh, well, then I'll be the only one with garlic breath, and it'll be really gross when we make out later.
Yes, it will.
Hmm.
Oh He had a gift involving Problem solving Never backing down I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
You know, Gus, I'm going to want to open an old-fashioned ice cream shoppe at some point.
This is because of Juliet, isn't it?
Every time you launch into the dream about opening an ice cream store Shoppe.
Shoppe.
It's because there's some issue with Juliet.
Psychiatrists call it diversion coping.
This is because she's dating Declan now.
I wouldn't call it dating.
What would you call it?
Dating.
I just don't want to say it.
Come on, Gus, the guy lies his ass off about everything in his life and then he just apologizes and that gets him right off the hook.
Shawn, she really likes this guy.
Why are you trying to poke a hole into something that's working for her?
You know, you're right.
You're absolutely right.
If she wants to be in a relationship with a filthy rich guy who adores her, so be it.
Not this guy.
No, sir.
My spirit has to remained unchained, Gus, like my melodies.
Wow.
Be available for any opportunity.
Opportunity?
Yes, Gus, opportunity.
For a woman like that.
She's making eyes at me.
She has eyes, yes.
But they're looking at me.
Gus, don't be absurd.
She's looking directly at me.
She's piercing my mediumly-defined chest with her stark bedroom peepers.
That lady is trying to undress me with her eyes, Shawn.
Maybe she's dressing you.
You ever think of that?
Cover up your kankles.
Please.
I have the ankles of a stallion and that woman wants them.
That woman has a gun.
She's all yours.
I'm out of here.
Drop the cone!
I'm not dropping my cone, Shawn.
When are you going to eat that?
I don't want to die an empty stomach, Barry!
Who is Barry?
I don't know.
What do we do when we get to the end of the pier?
Why don't you ask Barry?
Don't kill us, please.
I'm not here to kill you.
In fact, I need your help.
Who are you?
My name is Nadia.
I work with Ewan O'Hara.
You know Juliet's brother?
We were operatives together.
I've been set up and I'm on the run.
Ewan told me about you.
He was impressed with your skills.
You're not kidding?
You're really a spy?
This is for real?
Yeah, this is for real.
So you weren't undressing him with your eyes earlier?
See, I told you.
Listen, I have very little time.
I need to be erased, to disappear.
How do you expect us to help you do that?
My mentor and most trusted ally, code name Strabinsky, was the only one who successfully erased himself.
He has the tools.
O'Hara said if someone doesn't exist, you'd be the person to find him.
Will you help me?
Well, I can only speak for myself.
But a few seconds ago, I thought we were going to have to jump off the pier, so Yeah, we can help you.
Okay.
Well, we don't have a lot of time.
They're following me.
They could be here any minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, there's no reason to be so dramatic.
We get it.
You're a spy.
Things are heightened for you people, but come on, we're a little more laid back in Santa Barbara.
It's a beach community.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end How are those stallion ankles now, buddy?
Where is she, Shawn?
Get over here.
Get out of the line of sight.
Come on!
Where the hell'd she go?
Underneath the pier, sir.
How the hell did we lose her?
Come around the other side.
Okay, great, what's your genius plan to get us out of here now?
Listen, you two, from now on, you're going to do exactly what I say.
Who are those guys she's with?
I have no idea.
Put this thing down.
We got to get to her from the ground.
Lassie, what's up?
Spencer, I just got a call about a white guy and a black guy running down the boardwalk wreaking havoc, and I immediately thought of you guys.
Are you involved?
Don't know anything about said havoc.
What about the report of a black ops helicopter circling the bay firing off shots?
Helicopter in Santa Barbara firing shots?
Lassie, please.
Go to the men's bathroom.
Behind the condom machine is a vial of sanity serum.
Crack it, digest, call me in half an hour.
Don't This is a woman's bathroom.
I don't think we should be in here.
Sit down.
Away from the window.
Dude, purple octopus, 12 o'clock.
Shawn, you need to focus.
Okay, this is the deal.
I was in Kiev several years ago with Strabinsky.
It was an NQK mission.
NQK?
No Questions Kill mission.
Any more questions?
He told me the day would come that we would need to cut ties and go dark.
The next morning, he had erased himself and dropped off the grid.
I found this in my backpack.
He left it there.
I believe it was a clue for me to find him if I ever needed his help.
Nadia, this is blank.
Touch it.
What is it, Braille?
I don't think it's Braille.
Hello?
It's locked.
These impressions are in a formation, Shawn.
I think this has something to do with celestial patterns.
Stars.
I got something.
Something helpful and impressive.
I see Strabinsky in the sky, possibly with diamonds.
Please make some sense soon.
Do you still have that giant astronomy coloring book back in the Psych office?
It's not a coloring book.
Uh-oh.
He's going to be so mad at me.
Remember we have T- minus six minutes before a team of black ops close in and torture to kill.
Torture to kill?
Is that pretty cut and dry?
Or is there some wiggle room there?
Ah, Nadia, I have floor pads to avoid the scratching of hardwood floors.
You're kidding, right?
Yes, I am.
Nadia, it's going to cost us $438 plus tax Never mind.
Boom.
Phoenix constellation.
Damn it, that means Strabinsky's in Alabama.
You mean Arizona?
No.
He always talked about retiring here.
This much I know for sure.
Another reason why O'Hara thought you could help.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
This has nothing to do with constellations.
Get down.
It's just a clue to get us to the location F-E-N-l-X.
The Fenix Valley Path.
It's in the Los Padres Forest just outside of Santa Barbara.
Gus, you can't just make up stuff that doesn't exist.
It does exist, Shawn.
It's just not in any guidebooks.
It's named after a hiker who got lost there.
Oh, well, that's it then.
That's where we'll find Strabinsky.
That's what I just said.
But the Los Padres Forest is too big.
You can't just walk through there and find Strabinsky.
We have to fly over.
Do you know anybody who owns a chopper?
to that question is nobody.
But there's one guy.
I should be concerned, right?
Concerned and excited.
Really bad timing.
Declan, we're being tracked, which means in about seven-ish minutes, dudes in capes are going to storm your dope pad and start sniping us.
They will not be wearing capes, but they will be sniping us.
Declan, this is Nadia.
She is a spy.
The case we're working on is a matter of national, international and guber-national security.
Okay, but you can't stay long.
No need to worry about being tracked, Nadia.
Why is that?
I own the air rights for the whole block.
I can scramble the strongest of signals.
Now, unfortunately, whatever you guys are involved in, I don't think I can assist on Listen, just hear us out.
We need you to sponsor us.
No, no, no.
Sorry, guys.
But ever since I admitted to Juliet that I'm not a real criminal profiler, I promised I wouldn't assist on any police cases whatsoever.
Who's Juliet?
My girlfriend.
Wow.
Just dropping the G-bomb with reckless abandon, huh?
You know what?
You are missing a huge opportunity here.
Opportunity to jump right into a Bourne film.
This is not a movie.
This is reality and it's happening right now.
Look, guys, between you and me, I'd kill to get myself kneecap deep in this thing, but I'm trying to play the honesty card, so no lies, period.
Dec, I'm sorry, but I think I just used the last of your shampoo Shawn?
Gus?
Sorry, bunny, they just stopped by.
But they're leaving now.
I see what happened here.
Juliet was driving in the area, she spilled something on herself, she dropped by and asked if she could use the facilities.
No, Shawn, I slept here.
And then I woke up here and then I took a shower.
Yes, the old crashing- in-the-guest-room routine.
I am sorry.
What is your name?
Nadia.
Her name is Nadia, and we have chemistry.
Okay, Shawn, Gus, woman in leather, enjoy the rest of your weekend.
Mmm.
Can we please get down to business?
Yes, of course.
Declan, can we borrow your chopper or what?
Yeah.
Well, that depends.
I need it back tonight.
Tonight?
What do you mean?
Like this coming night?
Yeah, I'm flying Juliet to Napa for dinner and surprising her with a vacation plan.
The Amalfi Coast.
Amalfi Coast?
Ooh, bro.
I'd pull back.
Step on the brakes if I was you, man.
If I know one thing about Jules, it's that she likes to rough it on her vacays.
Hmm.
Yeah.
I wouldn't have guessed that.
Really?
It's true.
She's a hunter, a gather, woodswoman.
Tents, beans and bugs, that's how she does it.
We can have the chopper back in two, three hours, tops.
I guess that should work.
I mean, technically, I'm just loaning you a chopper to fly from point A to point B. And loaning us your pilot, too.
Oh, I am the pilot.
Damn, this is good fun.
It's so much more satisfying than the remote control version.
We have to find Strabinsky soon.
It's just a matter of time before they figure out we're airborne and send an F-14 to shoot us down.
What?
We're going to get shot down?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're in the right spot.
This is it.
Bring this birdie down, Declan.
You got it, you got it.
But hold on tight.
Landing's dicey at best for me.
Haven't you been flying your whole life?
Ah, no, that's a negative.
No, I just got my pilot's license three days ago.
What?
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
They're doing a knock, knock joke?
It must be some kind of spy code.
Nadia.
I guess not.
Nadia.
Strabinsky.
It's been a while.
Last time I saw you, you were four clicks outside of Mozambique.
Mmm.
Mozambique.
Tortured by pigmies.
Well, get in here.
Come on inside.
Well, welcome to my hidden abode.
Would you like a quick tour?
I joke.
It's a joke.
Sorry about the heat in here, but the super hydra drives are like ovens.
Suck up power like nobody's business.
Hey, can I ask you all a quick favor before we get this party started?
You want us to take our shoes off?
No.
I want you to tell me why you're here in the next 10 seconds or else I'm going to kill you all.
Wait, wait.
Calm down, Strabinsky.
I found you using the card you left in my backpack.
It's time for me to cut ties.
Nadia, you are being tracked.
You put me in jeopardy.
You know how long it took me to find this place, to set it up?
That door you came through, that's custom.
Translation, it's not from Home Depot.
I'm sorry, but But nothing.
It took me a week to put in that door and then you bring in two civvies here and there's a jack snapper out in there in a chopper.
I'm a psychic detective, so Which technically means I'm no longer a civvie, if you will.
I will snuff you out without even touching you.
Harsh.
Intimidating.
Intriguing how you would actually snuff without touching, but also fair.
You're right.
I am being tracked.
Will you erase me or not?
Nadia, you have been a busy, busy bee.
I'm just about done here deleting all your mission files.
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't delete operation Mitlu-Bolivia.
Open that one.
I can't open that file.
That's got special security.
Seriously, open it.
Okay, maybe I was unclear, or I spoke super duper fast, or I switched languages or something, but I can't open this file.
I know you can open the file.
Open it.
This feels like an old school spy tiff that deserves some privacy.
You know, that's right.
Don't move a muscle.
What is operation Mitlu?
Open it.
Oh, yeah, wait a second.
Bolivia.
I remember hearing something over the agency wire about that mission.
The embassy was broken into.
A couple diplomats were killed and someone made off with a suitcase of GCC's.
What are GCC's?
Global Currency Certificates.
You can cash them in for any currency around the world.
It's like literally having a money printing press.
That's what this is about, huh, Nadia?
You used my incredible gifts to get yourself erased so that you can go retire somewhere exotic in the world with a bunch of GCC's?
You have one minute to open the file, Strabinsky.
Go ahead, shoot me.
I can't open this file.
You of all people should know the only way to open a file this secure is a Level 3 computer in a government building.
Who did we just help erase?
A very capable killer.
Shawn, it's my day off.
I had a cold beer in my hand, I'm on my boat, and literally had my fishing line in the water when I got this call.
Dad, does Chief Vick know that you're sitting in her chair while she's on holiday?
I'm in no mood.
I'm just saying your naked thighs are touching the fabric there.
Don't you think she'd be a little weirded out?
Sorry, guys.
No choice.
No, I made a promise to Juliet, so had to come clean and told them everything.
Everything?
Everything.
Yes, Shawn.
I know he was with you when you guys got in over your heads on an international case you had no business being a part of.
But on my part, mostly as a pilot.
You're a pilot?
Oh, did I leave that part out?
It's only been three days.
Now the guy decides to have a crisis of conscience.
Is there anything else you'd like to confess?
Yes.
This morning when you found that fresh, sliced grapefruit on your bedside table and you asked me who put it there and I said, "The grapefruit fairy," I was lying.
It was me.
Oh, my God, that's so cute.
Pretty cute.
All right, everyone, Shawn, where is this Nadia woman?
I mean Lassie, grab them!
Grab those Grab those men!
These are the guys that were in the helicopter.
They're the ones that tried to kill us on the pier this morning.
I knew you were on the pier!
Shawn, calm down.
These are the good guys.
Agent Camden Driggs, Special Division, Department of Clandestine Human-Source Intelligence.
This is Tom.
You get that whole swanky intro and all he gets is, "This is Tom"?
Senior communications analyst in charge of Operative In-call Status Objectives, Subdivision Supervisor Tom Fong.
I get it.
I get, "This is Tom.
" Mmm-hmm.
You guys are CIA?
When was the last time you were in Washington, hmm?
Your eighth grade fieldtrip?
Everyone in a suit isn't CIA.
We're Special Military Ops.
Mr. Spencer, you are aware that you helped aid and abet one of the world's most dangerous government operatives.
Well, when you say it like that, it makes it sound way worse than it is.
And how would you prefer I say it?
Inflection is everything.
Try it again, maybe a little sing-songy.
Shawn, you will cooperate with these men.
I want to know everything that Nadia said to you.
I want you to retrace every step you took since she made contact.
And we know about Strabinsky.
Where is he?
Oh, come on, you guys.
That man just wants to live in peace.
He gave 12 years of his life to y'all.
I'll give you my flight logs.
God, that felt good.
Being open and honest.
Good job, Spencer.
You led Nadia right to Strabinsky, and now she took him out.
She's cleaning up her tracks, eliminating witnesses.
Well, if that's the case, then why are Gus and I still alive?
Because you two aren't worth eliminating.
Oh, we're worth eliminating.
Agent Fong, call in for air support.
I want the rest of you to fan out on the mountainside.
We've got hours, not days.
Correct me if I'm wrong, the industry standard is 18 hours, otherwise we can kiss her goodbye.
That's right, Detective.
Well, I can find that spy in 19 hours.
This is not a negotiation, and you went up.
Fine.
I can find that spy in 13 hours.
Shawn.
You know, if you shut up and let me do my job, I'll find that spy in eight hours.
Okay.
Find that spy.
You know what?
Get out of here.
Both of you.
Go sit in the chopper.
I'm tired of looking at your face.
Hey, Tom Fong, you coming with?
Listen, Shawn, if this woman has any connection to my brother Come on, Jules No, Shawn, I know that you were taken by him and you guys shared some sort of bond or something, but let's not forget, he eluded authorities and exists in more than a gray world.
How much more?
These people can't be trusted.
Watch yourself, Shawn.
This is not a case you should fool with.
It's bigger than us.
Us?
The department.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Aren't you two supposed to be waiting in the chopper?
Lassie, what are you doing here?
You know every time those Washington guys come to town, you turn into a 14th wheel.
Look at Tom Fong.
He's wearing two watches.
How are you going to hang with that?
Spencer, you know nothing of these people.
He does that so he can tell the time in two places in the world simultaneously.
Gus likes to know the time in Santa Barbara and Pasadena.
Only needs one watch.
You, Lassiter, you're running point on this.
What?
I've been doing this long enough to know that the guy with no life will get the job done.
Not to mention you know the landscape.
Do I ever!
O'Hara.
I can't believe Driggs beat me in the first round of "Find That Spy".
Shawn, this isn't funny.
Nadia is going to find us and kill us.
Gus, don't be Fine Young Cannibals cover of Suspicious Minds.
We're going to find her.
But we do need a plan.
Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to pack me a medium-sized suitcase and move to Mexico.
You of all people should know that a file this secure can only be opened on a Level 3 computer in a government building.
I got it.
I know where she is.
Does anyone know where the closest government building is with a Level 3 computer?
Put it on.
Don't forget it next time.
We need Yes!
Yes!
I am sensing she is here.
She's here in this building.
Let's split up and cover all high-security floors.
Wait, can we just walk into a government building like this without clearance?
You can if you're with me.
We're looking for somebody.
Oh, can I take a look at that?
Does it have a Presidential seal?
Let's move, people!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Somehow I think she'll be found somewhere a little less obvious.
Computer problems?
I hate it when that happens.
Where's an easy button when you need one?
Oh, Shawn, you do have a skill set.
Do you have any other talents?
You used us.
You lied to us.
And you killed Strabinsky.
Oh, come on, I didn't kill Strabinsky.
Maybe no one did.
Plus, if I had these certificates, why am I still here?
Why?
Okay, fine.
So if you really were set up, let us help you.
You have no idea what you're involved in.
They made me take the certificates.
Who?
Who was it?
If I knew who it was I wouldn't be here.
He was in disguise.
But it's someone on the inside.
I don't know who and I don't have time to give you Spy 101 lessons right now.
Oh, really?
Because Gus recently saw half of Spies Like Us.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Doctor.
And you don't have a choice.
Uh, she has choices and she just made one.
I'm about to make one, too.
I can either dial up Driggs or you can tell us what happened in Bolivia during Operation Mitlu.
By the way, who gets to name those operations because that seems fun.
Hand me the phone before I have to resort to hurting you.
Yeah, right.
Without touching me, hmm?
No.
I am going to touch you.
Fan out, people.
What the hell is that?
Okay, people, listen up.
No one is to leave this building.
I'll be questioning each of you separately.
One at a time.
It's going to take a while, so I hope you packed a snack.
I'll handle it from here.
I want this unit sent to headquarters to be washed.
She was definitely looking for something, there's just no way of knowing what.
Mmm.
You know, I think I can help with this.
We're probably going to need some sort of clearance level.
It doesn't have to be the highest, just enough to get me one of those badges that beeps when you scan it.
Detective, I'm not at liberty to disclose any information regarding classified documents.
Perhaps if you want to go back in time, make a couple of different life decisions, join the Academy, train with some real investigators, then we could talk, but until then Nadia said she was set up by someone on the inside.
Do you get the feeling that Driggs is hiding more than he has to?
No.
No, Shawn.
Don't do this.
Nadia is crazy and dangerous.
Driggs may be an unpleasant man, but that doesn't make him the bad guy.
I don't trust him.
What are you doing?
Whatever's on this file is the secret to what happened in Bolivia and we will prove that Driggs is behind it.
That thing is half melted, Shawn.
There's no way we can retrieve any information off of it.
Yeah, but Strabinsky can.
Oh, come on, I didn't kill Strabinsky.
Maybe no one did.
Sorry about the heat in here, but the super hydra drives are like ovens.
Suck up power like nobody's business.
Oh, my gosh.
Yeah, the Santa Barbara power grid would show hot spots for areas that are using crazy amounts of electricity.
Like hospitals or power plants.
Yeah, and giant mansions like mine.
I hear that.
See, that's what we need, Shawn, our very own computer guy for the office.
Nice.
That's not a computer guy.
He's my pastry chef.
This is my snack.
Thank you, Chuy.
Crème brûlée, guys?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, what's that one?
The white one.
Right there.
White means hot.
Hmm.
It's a small apartment building.
Yeah.
Unless this person has that's got to be Strabinsky.
Declan, I must say you've once again delivered in the clutch.
I also have to ask you one more teeny-weeny favor.
I believe I'm fresh out of favors.
Please.
Please wait 30 minutes before you call Juliet and tell her we were here.
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Shawn.
And Gus.
Are you kidding me?
Again?
How did you guys find me?
Normally I'd be hot under the collar, but I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a couple of familiar faces.
Come on, get in here.
Come on.
Thanks, man.
Oh, look, it's very earthy.
Oh.
It's creamy.
Hmm.
I hate to ask this of guests, you know, but could you guys do me a huge favor?
I think so.
No.
Probably.
Could you take your shoes off?
New place.
Oh!
Oh!
Berber carpets.
They say it's stain resistant, but I don't trust them.
I don't trust them at all.
And now while you're at it, in the next 10 seconds, why don't you tell me why you're here or else I'm going to set you both on fire without even striking a match.
Whoa, Strabs, easy, buddy.
Hey, I just moved in here.
Come on.
I mean, they got a laundry.
They've got an awesome pool.
Look at that.
Huh?
Well, it's not awesome, but it's circular.
It You can't even swim laps in it.
But it's a pool.
Do you guys have any idea how hard it is to find a body decoy that works?
This one's too fat.
This one's too skinny.
This guy's just right, but he's an Eskimo.
Strabinsky, if you help us this one last time, you have my word that we will not find you a third time.
Unless we need your expertise a third time.
Or we want to go swimming.
In circles.
What do you want?
Uh, Nadia was trying to download something on to this thing.
Huh.
It looks like a still photo from an embassy.
At the embassy in Bolivia.
That must be the suitcase with the certificates.
So she did take it.
How did I fall for this again?
Please tell me you have a plan.
I can see her running from a building.
It's a government building.
There's a red, yellow and green flag.
The flag is on fire, though.
Something went There was an explosion.
That's right.
That's the Bolivian Embassy.
How do you know this?
She has a suitcase.
What's in the suitcase?
Give me a second.
Let me try to x-ray through it.
I'm sensing, I'm getting, I'm seeing certificates of some kind.
Crate and Barrel.
No.
Bed, Bath & Beyond?
That seems unlikely.
Global current affairs something.
GCC's.
Global Currency Certificates.
Where do you see them?
I see them in my mind, Tom.
I'm a psychic, you see.
A psychic spy, maybe the only one.
Probably the only one.
Definitely the only non-Russian one.
Unless you count Men Who Stare at Goats.
You're going to take a phone call in the middle of this?
Life doesn't stop for the psychic world.
How do you think I get any errands done or knock kinky boots at nighttime?
Shh.
Just get it going, would you?
Stop milking it.
I know what you're up to, Shawn.
Will you all excuse me for a moment?
Could somebody tell me what the hell's going on?
What do you want?
You're poking around where you don't belong and you have all your facts wrong.
Okay, listen, I saw the picture of you in Bolivia.
You lied to me again.
You're making me question my own judgment here.
An hour ago, I accused Gus of trying to rope me into a pyramid scheme.
If you need a shoulder to cry on, go buy a goldfish.
You have something that's mine.
I want it back.
Okay, look, look, look, look, look.
I will give you the picture, okay?
But you have to agree to meet me now.
Can I reach you on this phone?
Maybe another 10 seconds.
I'll find you.
No, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look, Gus and I are busy.
I'm not sure where we'll be later.
Maybe, uh Maybe we should find you.
Not going to happen.
I'm going to give you a location where you can meet me.
Don't change your clothes.
Why?
You like this outfit?
No.
So I can spot you in a crowd.
Who were you just talking to?
Nadia.
She was in the police station.
Are you kidding me?
So risky, so sexy.
I think she's really starting to like me.
She wants to kill you, Shawn.
Oh, really?
Then why did she just make a date with me for tonight?
A date to kill you.
You need to go back up in that room and tell the feds everything she just said.
No, Gus, this is our chance to Bourne it up.
I'm Matt Damon, you're Adewale Akinnuoye Agbajon That's not how you say his name.
That's who you are, though.
Oh, no, I'm not.
I'm not going to be there.
It's too late to recast.
The part is yours.
Let's go take down a spy.
Shawn.
Shawn.
Nadia, my code name is Dabney Wilhelm.
Please call me that.
I will not.
Why?
Because I know your name is Shawn Spencer.
I know you.
Code names are for anonymity.
What's this?
It's a newspaper.
Yes, but why do you have it?
It's a spy thing.
It looks like I'm sitting here reading ads about puppies, but really, I'm just combing the perimeter.
It's totally idiotic.
It's nighttime.
It's idiotic.
Like the silly coat you're wearing.
You're so harsh.
Gus, lose the paper.
What the hell's he doing in there?
Unfortunately, nothing out of the ordinary.
Seriously, how long are we going to let this go on for?
Just relax.
I want to see if she'll hang herself.
We might get a confession.
Sir, we don't need a confession.
We've got enough on her going AWOL, with the break-in We can nail her right now.
All right, let's cut to the chase, shall we?
I want you to trust me, Shawn.
Because we have a connection.
What is it about Spencer that people see that I don't?
She's conning him.
Let's cut to the real chase.
This is about you and me.
From the moment we jumped off that pier, we had something.
Tell me you believe that I'm innocent and maybe we could spend some time off the grid.
A guy with your abilities and a girl like me, we could do some damage.
Huh?
Yeah.
Come on, you don't have to be shy with me.
Stop, stop it.
You've been playing with me this whole time.
I don't believe anything you say.
Prepare to mobilize.
We're going in.
Repeat, we're about to move in.
So what if I did this?
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Nadia.
I can't.
As much as I'd like to be the Swiss to your ham in one of those croissants at Au Bon Pain, it just wouldn't be fair to you.
Why is that?
Because I trust the croissant more than you.
Fine.
Why did you even come here?
To hear me say that I killed those two Bolivians and stole the certificates?
And I used my skills to steal enough money to live out my days at the Amalfi Coast?
What is it with everyone and the Amalfi Coast?
Mobilize all tactical units.
Get in there.
Take the subject down now.
Stay with the van.
What?
Go, go, go!
Get down!
Get down!
Advise.
Suspect is secure.
Good job, men.
Agent Fong, take her through processing.
I'm sorry, Nadia.
I love my country too much.
My country's America.
I told you that newspaper thing was a dumb idea.
Are you at all serious?
We just captured a dangerous international spy.
You're hung up on the newspaper bit?
No, I'm hung up on the fact that you've been obsessed with this woman this whole time.
She makes the ultimate move on you and you shut her down?
What's wrong with you?
That makes no sense.
Are you crazy?
I know, it doesn't make any sense.
Maybe I am crazy.
All I can tell you is that just now, in that moment, all I could think about was Jules.
I just can't wrap myself around the fact that she's dating Declan.
Actually It's actually killing me.
Shawn, that is not fair.
I know.
I know it's not fair.
And you're right, she likes this guy.
And who am I to stand in the way?
Exactly.
You think I don't want her to be happy?
I want her to be happy.
But serious Shawn moment here, I want to be happy, too.
And for some reason, I can't imagine that happening without Juliet.
How crazy is that?
On a scale of one to 10?
Man!
What?
I was going to say four.
I know you all are wondering, "Was it dangerous out there?
"Was it a little touch and go?
" Mostly go.
With plenty of touch.
And to quote an unlikely source, Mr. William Ocean Mmm.
"When the going gets tough, the tough get going".
Are we finished?
I believe so.
It feels good.
Gus, you good?
I'm great.
Great, I'm out of here.
Whoa, whoa, hold up.
This is Nadia's phone.
She must have slipped it in my pocket while she was feeling me up at the park.
Something's downloading.
Oh, my God.
She was set up.
How come the guy with the gun didn't show up on the security camera photos we saw at Strabinsky's?
It wasn't taken with that camera, Gus, it was taken from the sky.
Like from an airplane or a hot air balloon Or a satellite?
Don't make up crap from the future.
He's right.
These are the kind of photographs usually taken over occupied territories or foreign embassies.
That's why she had to break into the government office.
She needed a Level 3 computer so she could access the satellite photos.
It was the only photo that could vindicate her.
Who's this?
The guy with the gun?
Two watches?
Agent Tom Fong.
Patch me through to Air Strike Command.
Holy crap!
It's Tom Fong.
Lassiter, this thing isn't over.
Assemble the team, get a hold of Driggs.
We have to find Fong.
Driggs has to have a way of tracking him.
Oh, you got away from me in Bolivia, Nadia, but that's over.
Now tell me where you hid the certificates.
I'll tell you.
Wait, no, I won't.
I guess it's going to get ugly, then.
Freeze!
Drop the weapon, Tom!
Freeze, Tom!
How did you find me?
I found Strabinsky twice in one day.
You asking me how I tracked you down, Jack?
Fong.
You're a disgrace to the suit, Tom.
Get him out of here.
Oh!
Oh, Nadia, you wanted to get caught in that park.
You knew you would.
You needed to.
You knew you'd been betrayed, but without knowing who the bad guy was, who could you trust?
Me.
Because you knew I would figure it out and lead everyone here to see it with their own eyes.
And you dig me.
And you look almost as good upside down as you do right side up.
And that can only be said about you, me, and maybe Javier Bardem.
No, not Javier Bardem.
No, you don't think so?
Jon Stewart.
Jon Stewart?
Really?
I wouldn't We didn't find Fong, Driggs did.
It's all semantics, Gus.
It's not semantics at all.
Note to self, look up the word "semantics".
Uh, guys, excuse me.
Oh!
Right, of course.
Oh, yeah.
What do we, uh Oh, wow.
Oh, that looks complicated.
Do you know what he did to your feet to get you up there?
Hey, Shawn, Gus.
I buzzed you up like half an hour ago.
Well, we would have been here sooner, but we got lost in your topiary maze.
We just wanted to thank you one more time for sponsoring our case.
Yeah, well, it all worked out, so I'm happy to have helped.
Well, listen, I was in the middle of bidding on something when you guys rang the bell.
It's up to 30 million, so it's getting slightly heated.
They're waiting for me upstairs on the phone.
You're making a phone bid of 30 million US dollars?
Yeah, I wish.
Euros.
What?
May I?
Shawn.
Hey.
Hi.
Why are you standing in Declan's foyer all by yourself?
Creepy?
Sort of.
Yeah.
Shawn, you have solved a lot of cases for the SBPD, but this one was particularly impressive.
I mean, Bolivian embassies and international espionage.
How did you and Gus do it all by yourself?
Well, I'm not going to lie to you, Jules.
It was difficult.
But now that it's over, I'm ready to put "freelance spy" on my list of special skills.
Well, here's a mystery you can solve for me.
Yesterday, I came here after work and I found three crème brûlée dishes by Declan's computer.
Any idea who could have eaten all of those?
Mmm, I would say that Declan has an enormous sweet tooth.
And that shouldn't be ignored, Jules.
Sugar is a gateway drug.
Hmm.
Well, I guess then it will remain an open case.
I guess so.
Well, I was just about to head out and do some shopping for the trip.
Right, the trip.
Of course.
Uh Yeah have a Have a Have a great four days off, Jules.
It's two weeks, Shawn.
Wow, that's lengthy.
That's significant.
That's a real amount of vacation time.
Have an amazing trip.
Okay?
Promise me.
You know, they say that, uh, these These kind of trips are once-in-a-lifetime experiences and that they're even better when you have someone you care about to share them with.
And you do.
Take lots of pictures.
Not of sights.
Don't take pictures of buildings.
Take pictures of moments.
That's what matters.
Capture them here and hold on to them here.
At least that's what I would do.
I don't know, you might take blurry photos of your espresso at some random cafe.
Hey, buddy.
Buddy, hey.
Aw, you're not going to have to worry anymore about that hotel in Amalfi being all booked up.
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?
Because I just bought it.
Oh, yeah!
Well, good luck with that, man.
If Gus and I ever make it out that way, we'll look forward to stealing some towels.
I'm going to have them monogrammed.
Amalfi.

{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Previously on Psych.
He's an art thief?
A dangerous art thief.
Never been caught, never left enough evidence to be accused.
But we did find a burning cigarette in the ashtray over there.
This is my gun.
You see, a gentleman of leisure never packs his weapon next to his socks.
Hello, Despereaux.
I've often fantasized about escaping from prison, you know.
Yeah, I'm flying Juliet to Napa for dinner and surprising her with a vacation plan, the Amalfi Coast.
These kind of trips are once in a lifetime experiences, and they're even better when you have someone you care about to share them with, and you do.
First-class tickets?
And three nights' hotel paid for.
By a world-class criminal.
Please.
Despereaux staged art thefts.
That's barely a crime.
I don't think you're allowed to accept lavish gifts from people you've sent to prison.
Says who?
The Sultan of Canada?
Look, all Despereaux wants is a little face time.
Ten minutes, maybe less.
He's lonely.
All by himself in this Canadian prison, and we put him there.
The least we could do is give him a chance to explain himself.
Oh, so I'm the crazy one for being nervous about accepting an invitation to visit from a criminal who almost killed us?
That little gun he pointed at my head?
Twice.
Not loaded.
How do you know?
He told me.
You spoke to him before this?
I follow him on Twitter.
Oh, my gosh.
Gus, come on.
Be a little spontaneous.
Canada's one of the top 50 countries in the world.
And how many countries are there?
At least 50.
Maybe more.
You have exactly four hours to come up with a good lie for your boss.
We're going to Canada, man!
You're going to be in Canada.
What?
I'm not going to bail you out this time.
I'm not going to ask you to.
Good, 'cause you got my only suitcase.
I'll see you Monday, Pop.
Did you tell her yet?
Tell who what?
Come on, Shawn.
I overheard the whole conversation with Gus about Juliet going off on this trip with Declan Rand and how you're going to try to wow her and tell her how much you care about her before she gets too serious, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
I shared that with Gus in the men's room at the Red Robin.
Where were you hiding?
You butt-dialed me.
And you listened?
Shawn, I've spoiled my share of relationships over the years by keeping my mouth shut.
Tell her.
Tell her now.
Tell her five minutes from now.
She goes off to Italy with a guy who's rich, who is crazy about her, she ain't coming back with any doubts.
Dad?
Yeah, Shawn?
Can we never have this conversation again?
We can certainly try.
Buzz.
Hey.
Have you seen Juliet?
No.
Really?
Crap.
You okay?
Yeah, no.
Yeah.
I have to go meet this guy I put in prison.
I have a plane to catch and I really wanted to I want to tell her something.
Well, I can take a message.
No, it's not really the kind of thing you put in message form.
I'm a great listener.
Why don't we give it a dry run?
All right.
It's a little weird, creepy.
Necessary, perhaps.
See, the thing is, I want to tell her that I like her.
I kind of suspected.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It's really more than like.
Yeah, you know so much has happened, and you always think there's going to be another opportunity, but sometimes there isn't.
And what I've realized What I've realized is that I don't want to wait anymore.
I can't wait.
Not with this kind of stuff, you know?
Holy crap.
That was great.
Really?
Yeah.
No, Buzz, Buzz, don't write this.
I'm just sort of talking it out for myself, and you, apparently.
Dude, you addressed that to Chief Vick.
I did?
Oh!
Bullet dodged.
Super weird that would have been.
Yeah.
Oh!
It's Friday today, isn't it?
Yeah, Friday.
Yeah.
She asked me to get her passport updated.
She needed it today.
She already left?
I think so.
Okay, you're freaking out about something.
You were quiet the entire flight and you watched The Back-up Plan all the way through.
Are you okay?
I accidentally turned McNab and my father into confidantes.
It's a weird day.
But I realized this is the life I'm meant for.
Visiting minimum-security Canadian jails?
Exactly.
Trust me, Gus, we hear Despereaux's pitch, then it's smoked salmon, poutine and coffee crisp from here on out.
Whoa!
Go on.
Gentlemen.
Prison looks good on you.
You call it prison, I liken it to a mid-range Sandals resort.
I only know that because I once stole a cruise ship from a tiny Caribbean port.
Which port?
Why are we here?
My apologies for the short notice.
But I've had a bit of a realization.
And I have some things I need to tell you face-to-face.
You see, Shawn, my life's goal has always been to commit the perfect crime.
I've always thought of my heists as Elegant, victimless.
But you made me feel, somehow, regretful.
I You genuinely wanted me to be the greatest thief that ever lived.
You know that's right.
Well, gentlemen, I need you to know that I am capable of all the things you thought I could do, and more.
And I'd like the opportunity to prove it to you.
You don't have to prove to us that you're a great criminal.
I want to.
You shouldn't.
But I will.
Well, that was the weirdest Honestly, I feel a little bad for him.
Why?
He had this reputation of being able to get in and out of anything.
I spoiled it for him.
I feel some responsibility for that, Gus.
Plus, he felt needy, you know?
I mean, what does he care what I think?
He was exposed for what he was, that's all.
Gus, don't be both Ashlee Simpson albums.
There were three Ashlee Simpson albums.
That can't possibly be true.
Autobiography, Bittersweet I will not do this with you right now.
Get it right if you're going to criticize me, then.
Well, I think that went well.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end You broke him out of prison?
I did not.
Calm yourself, Gus.
Shawn had nothing to do with this.
I needed a visitor to make my escape work.
There's a security hole in the walk from the visitation room to the cell block.
I'm turning this car around right now.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I have this small, somewhat impressive shiv that I learned to make from one of 30 prisoners named Gord.
And I'm in the position, unfortunately, where I would have to use it.
I'm going to kill you, Shawn.
I give you my word, though, that I would cut you in a manner that you would not bleed out too much, and your recovery would be a matter of weeks.
Come on, Gus, considering the circumstances, I'd say that's pretty damn considerate.
Thank you.
Oh, would you be so good as to take this road toward the top of the mountains?
This first one here?
Yes, please.
Gus I got it, Shawn.
Our luggage was in the trunk, wasn't it?
Yes, it was.
Our wallets in the bags?
Mmm-hmm.
Passports in our wallets.
You know it.
I do have this, though.
Two Altoids?
No, I wish.
It's a piece of chalk that just split in half.
If we're out here for more than two days, I will eat you alive.
You couldn't eat me.
I will finish you whole.
That doesn't make any sense.
I will eat you in manageable, bite-sized pieces.
Twelve hours, 12 hours of overnight walking, Shawn.
It would have been six if we hadn't stopped to eat all that bark.
I was under the impression it would taste like maple syrup.
Mackintosh!
Oh, no.
No.
No.
I'm sorry, guys, but no.
We haven't asked you anything.
Guys, listen, you know that I like you a lot, but the last time that you were here, you got me fired.
Technically, you got yourself fired.
By doing what you asked.
We got you your job back.
At the lowest possible level.
A job.
We got you a job back.
I didn't know you wanted your original job back.
Now that I know that, I'll get right to work on it.
I just clawed my way up from traffic duty, okay?
So please don't ask me to do anything illegal again.
I'm afraid I can't promise that.
What I can do is give you the anonymous tip of the century.
I have sensed that Pierre Despereaux is going to escape.
What?
Let's go grab Ed Dykstra and you can take all the credit for it.
No.
Ed's not here.
Nobody is.
Our best detective was found dead yesterday at his fishing cabin.
Nobody thinks this sits right.
Well, while they're out there doing that, why don't you solve the jailbreak?
All by yourself.
Okay.
I will call the prison.
All right, thank you very much, then.
Well?
All of the prisoners are accounted for.
What?
No.
Did they actually see him?
No.
They do a rough numbers count in the a.m., Shawn.
Call them back.
Ask him if they saw him.
Because they didn't.
Because he's not there.
I guarantee it.
We got to get down there.
I am not calling back.
All units.
We have a reported art theft at a private home in Shaughnessy.
We have a reported art theft at a private home in Shaughnessy.
I know this house very well.
Been here many times before.
Parties, fundraisers.
You know the owners?
Oh, everybody does.
It's Crown Prosecutor John Santee.
He prosecutes every major case in town, including Mr. Despereaux.
That was a Van Gogh of some sort.
This was a Ming vase, beautiful piece.
And this was some kind of Egyptian staff thing.
This guy's loaded.
How much do you pay your prosecutors?
Oh, no, no, it's his wife.
She has all the money.
Her family, the waffle people.
Gus, you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yes.
We need to try those waffles.
Well, Despereaux certainly proved his point.
He pulled it off in the real world.
Will you stop gushing?
It's admirable.
His work is so clean, so effective.
Shawn.
Obviously we have to catch him.
That's a given.
Is this, uh Crown Prosecutor?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did the guards locate this Despereaux character?
No, not yet, sir.
Not going to find him.
He's long gone.
Mackintosh here is the only one who believed us.
I'd like you to take that into consideration come promotion time, you know?
He can't be here.
That's not possible.
Mackintosh, can we speak in private?
Please.
I can't believe this.
Yeah, I don't believe it either.
Where's our car?
Well, I imagine it's in the parking lot, where it should be.
Isn't this a wonderful thing?
Not a single soul in this prison has any clue what we've done.
Shh!
"We" didn't do anything.
Perhaps we have pulled off the perfect crime.
I mean, what is a better alibi than being in prison?
Enjoy the rest of your trip, Shawn.
I know our secret's safe, seeing how you could be considered an accessory, and since you merely "sensed" my escape.
It's a very effective use of psychic-ness.
I can't believe you killed a guy!
I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about.
And not just any guy, you killed the You killed the Crown Prosecutor.
Yeah, him.
It's not so easy in the real world, is it?
Can't control all the little variables.
Or did you intend to kill Santee all along?
Was that the job?
I didn't kill anyone.
Yeah?
Then why did they find your signature cigarette in the house?
Why'd they find your fingerprints?
Oh, Camilla Parker Bowles.
I've been set up.
I think we're the ones who got set up.
Somebody came in and planted those things after I stole the art.
I mean, now they're trying to pin me for murder.
Surely you can see that.
Nope.
Nope.
No.
Tell it to the judge.
I don't love you anymore.
It's like you're speaking gibberish to me right now.
That's how much sense you're making.
Lassie!
What are you doing in Canada?
I should be asking you two the same question.
I'm here to extradite Despereaux back to the States.
What?
When is that happening?
It was supposed to be today.
We got approval to extradite him on Monday.
That was his plan.
The perfect alibi, he's in jail Leave the country.
He's not going anywhere now.
Not until they eliminate him as a murder suspect first, which makes no sense, because he's been in prison the whole time.
Just tell me something, are you crazy?
Seriously, what is wrong with this country?
Jules.
You came here, to Vancouver.
Yes.
That's why you needed your passport in such a hurry.
How did you know that?
Are you okay?
Yes, I am.
I need to speak with you, though.
You and I, before you head off to Italy with Declan and get all caught up in the magic that's Barcelona and the running of the bulls You do know where Italy is, right, Shawn?
Before you make any major life decisions, can we please sit down and talk?
Here?
In the lockdown?
Sure.
Okay.
Not here.
Not now.
Later?
Yes, later.
We'll speak.
Okay.
Okay.
Which one?
Which one what?
Which one are you freaking out about?
Juliet or Despereaux?
I don't know, both, I guess.
What's going on with you?
They really found fingerprints?
A lot of them, Shawn.
Why?
Don't you think Despereaux would have worn gloves?
Welcome to the Gordon Mark Hotel.
Will you need help with your bags?
Yes, we will.
What was that?
It's called a tip, Gus, a Canadian coin.
The dollars here are coins.
It was a York Peppermint Pattie, Shawn.
What?
That's way too generous.
Are you sure we should be staying here?
Gus, the room is paid for.
It would be a crime not to use it.
It's paid for by a murderer.
Alleged murderer.
No, no, Shawn.
You are not turning around on him now, are you?
It doesn't make a lot of sense, Gus.
Think about it.
Despereaux's a perfectionist.
Look at his nails.
That crime scene was as sloppy as it gets.
That's weird.
They're coming for us.
They're not coming for us.
This could be for us.
Act natural.
Shawn, Despereaux escaped.
What, just now?
Yes, of course just now.
And you think we helped him?
What?
No.
Why would you say that?
No reason.
Mackintosh, why are you surrounding us?
Right.
One of the visitors at the prison saw him get in the back of your trunk.
What?
No way.
I'm going to get you some help.
I'm just going to grab this Peppermint Pattie.
I didn't mean to give it to you.
Shawn!
Your plane tickets were paid for by Despereaux.
And your room?
Kind of a package deal, Ed.
Your car rental?
He paid for the rental car?
What part of "all-inclusive" do you not understand, Gus?
Yes, he may have paid for that, too.
And some walking-around money.
The man has a lot of disposable income.
What?
It's not like we're friends, Gus.
It says here you also sent him a birthday present.
You bought him a present?
I had no choice.
He got me these jeans last Christmas.
You forgot my birthday.
Okay, guys, I know this looks bad.
Really, really bad.
Let's not forget I'm the one who caught this guy in the first place.
It's true, Ed, he did.
I came here to tell you that Despereaux would escape, which he did, and I will catch him again.
I will also tie him to the murder of that Crown Prosecutor guy if he, in fact, did that as well.
Now if we could stop interrogating one another and start working together and loving one another, we can get this done.
Let's go back to the crime scene, and start ourselves a real investigation.
What are we doing?
We are looking for discrepancies.
Are we trying to convict or exonerate Despereaux?
I don't know, Gus, I haven't decided yet.
You have a tremendous eye for detail, Shawn.
I had only just hid.
Despereaux, what are you doing here?
Same thing you're doing here.
Trying to prove me innocent.
No, we haven't decided if we think you're innocent.
I did.
You're not.
You're making this very difficult.
Coming back to the scene of the crime?
Come on.
You're trying to cover up the evidence.
Well, my plan was to do the job and then sneak back into prison.
But when you told me about the body and the fingerprints and the cigarette, well, I had to break out again.
I had to see what they did to set me up.
And they did a good job.
Allow me to clear myself.
I'll go back.
Scout's honor.
Oh!
Scout's honor.
Good enough for me.
Not this time, Despereaux.
What options do we have, Shawn?
He's here!
Despereaux is here.
He is in the closet!
Follow me, you Mounties!
He is "oot" and "aboot.
" Well, this is comfortable.
Come on!
Nice, Shawn.
Maybe you guys should just head home.
I'm not convinced Despereaux's the killer.
Why would a guilty man risk coming back?
Why would an innocent man bludgeon me like a sport tuna?
It's a tiny bump.
If I hadn't waxed my head, I'd be dead right now.
How is wax a factor?
Shawn, look.
Gus Pardon me.
Mrs Mrs. Santee?
Yes?
Hello, I'm Shawn Spencer, Psychic Detective.
This is Big Apple Mackintosh and my partner, Yasmine Bleeth.
I'm sensing that the safe was opened.
Is that accurate?
Yes, I found it open when I got home.
If you don't mind my asking, what kind of art was stored in the safe?
None.
Johnny believed that art was meant to be seen, and never hidden.
Which is why this all happened.
He never understood the threats that displaying wealth posed.
So what was in the safe?
Money?
Jewelry?
No, those things are in a safety deposit box.
This was just work documents.
What was missing from the safe?
Nothing.
Really shouldn't stay here.
What, in our own room?
We're making ourselves accomplices to murder.
I'm so torn, Gus.
Despereaux only steals art.
He has a compelling argument.
He busts out of prison to do one last job, sneaks back in before anyone notices.
He's being extradited tomorrow, so that's perfect.
Job turns out to be a setup, they use it to kill someone, Despereaux finds out, of course he needs to escape again.
That's too much, Shawn.
I knew you'd come around, Shawn.
So, what made you change your mind about my innocence?
His mind isn't changed.
Ah!
There you are.
Darling, this is them.
Thank you for helping him.
You met a girl on the run?
No, don't be ridiculous.
I met her in prison.
Don't go back.
Wouldn't dream of it.
I really should go.
Do you English even know the sock-on-the-door rule?
What exactly went on in here?
More importantly, do I need to get a new room andlor sheets?
Relax, gentlemen.
I think I have a solution to all our problems.
I want to hire you to prove my innocence.
You can't hire us.
We're trying to capture you.
Oh, fair enough.
You can continue to try to capture me, blah, blah, blah.
But I also want you to prove that I'm not a murderer.
She must have forgot her tongue.
Hey.
Hey.
Can I come in?
Why?
"Why"?
You kind of made a big deal about us talking.
Did I?
Huh!
Come on.
I really need to talk to you, too.
I came by, like, 20 minutes ago, but I heard voices.
I wasn't sure if I had the right room.
Do you have a girl in there?
What?
No.
No, not in me.
In here.
No one's in here.
There's no I'm just I'm alone in here like a wolf.
Okay.
Then why can't I come in?
Because I can't do this with you right now.
You said it was important.
I lied.
Okay?
I lie.
I do things like that.
Come on, Shawn, I am at a loss.
You want to talk, you don't want to talk If you can't say what's on your mind then I will say what's on mine.
I broke up with Declan.
Why would you do that?
I mean, I just can't do this right now.
Any time later.
You name it.
We can schedule it.
No, don't bother.
No, Jules Girl trouble?
Is there anything I can help you with?
No, you know what?
I think you've been more than enough help already.
Will you just be straight with us for once?
I will be utterly transparent.
Who hired you for the job?
I don't know.
Well, now we're getting somewhere.
The job was brought to me in prison by Marty Sewell.
He's a matchmaker.
That's where you found the girl?
No, no, no.
Matchmaker as in middleman.
He puts a client and a criminal together.
He offered me the job in prison and told me that it had to happen instantly.
Fine.
Where do we find him?
Martin finds you.
You don't find him.
That is, unless, of course, you're psychic.
You give me two hours.
And don't have sex in our beds.
I can only ask why.
Why do you guys hate me so much?
Mackintosh, we don't hate you.
We want to help you.
By letting you help us.
Can't get this computer to work.
I told you his password wasn't "Señor Whopper Pants".
It was worth a shot, Gus.
This is Detective Breitling's computer.
The poor guy just died.
You shouldn't be using it.
There's a mourning period.
Not for electronics.
Yeah, like if it was his coffee mug, then we wouldn't use it.
Can you get us an address for a Martin Sewell?
No!
Look, no, I cannot do anything more for you guys.
What if I told you he was the one behind the Santee robbery?
How do you know that?
Oh!
Yeah.
And then you will leave?
Thank you, Shawn.
It would have taken me weeks to find Sewell.
Now, let me do the talking.
Hello, Martin.
Surprised to see me?
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Uh Do you hear screaming?
No.
No, come on, Despereaux is a consummate gentleman.
He's going to kill that guy.
Whoa!
Despereaux!
Let him go!
That's the plan if he doesn't tell me who hired him for the job.
Who hired you?
Come on!
Tell me what I need to know, Marty.
I can't hold much longer.
It was It was Crossley!
Oops!
What the hell does "oops" mean?
Uh, he was somewhat of a big crime lord up here.
I was in prison with him for a while.
I was kind of having an affair with his wife.
You met her at the hotel?
Will you put that guy down?
Oh!
Oh, yes.
Almost forgot.
Come on.
You killed him.
He'll be fine.
He's just in shock.
It's actually quite cleansing once you come to.
You've been dangled off a building before?
I've been the dangler.
It's enormously effective.
Terrible on the wrists.
Terrible.
Despereaux, we have some serious questions for you.
Fire away.
Exactly how do you pick up women in prison?
Oh, Valeria was visiting Frank at an adjoining table, and our eyes just met.
You know how these things happen.
What about Crossley?
Frank Crossley was the most feared man in our prison.
He managed to run his whole empire from inside, without missing a beat.
Even had a man killed in Toronto in an hour, from the exercise room.
Extraordinary.
Oh, dear.
Come on.
Pierre, they have us surrounded.
You got to trust me.
Give yourself up, I will solve this case for you.
But there is no way that we are getting out of here.
About that.
Have you ever seen those Batman movies?
Toodle-oo!
Where does he get those wonderful toys?
So, you just happened to bump into Despereaux?
I was following the vibrations.
Spencer, Guster, I cannot help you anymore.
Wait, you've helped us before?
I swear, I am going to leave you to rot in this backward, rain-drenched den of politeness.
No offense.
None taken.
I like your suit.
Where's Juliet?
She didn't want to come.
Do we know why?
I imagine it was female trouble and I don't care.
Now give up Despereaux, stop messing around, and let me take him back to meet his maker.
I'm sorry, Detective, you're going to kill him?
No.
It's a term for "bring him to justice".
The term literally is "bring him to justice".
"Meet your maker," I think, means murder.
This is about me now?
He's the one traipsing around town with your suspect.
I'm having a vision.
It was It was Crossley!
He managed to run his whole empire from inside, without missing a beat.
Spencer It's a man, a bad man, a murderer.
He authored a murder.
He runs this crime business from behind bars.
His name's Frank Frank Crossley.
All right, this meeting's over.
I want you in my office.
And not you and not you.
Come on, bring him in.
What the hell are we supposed to do?
All right, enough of the games.
What do you know about Detective Breitling's murder?
Detective Breitling?
The one who just died at the fishing cabin with the sticky keyboard?
Don't play coy with me, boy.
You know that clearly we believe Frank Crossley killed Breitling.
Wow, I was really moving in a different direction.
We found this.
It was hidden in Detective Breitling's house.
This is just a series of dates that all contradict each other.
Huh.
This would seemingly indicate that Crossley is innocent.
Shawn, you've got to stop hiding things from us.
This is very serious.
How close was Breitling getting to bringing down Crossley's organization?
Do you know what he found?
He found something?
He told his wife to go spend the night with her sister.
The next thing you know, he turns up dead.
You've got to tell us what he found.
No, those things are in our safety deposit box.
This was just work documents.
Can we go back to Breitling's desk?
Did Breitling know the Crown Prosecutor?
We all know the Crown Prosecutor.
Did he talk to him?
Not recently, according to his cell phone records.
No, he probably wouldn't.
It's not safe.
Did he have any other correspondence with him?
Uh, I could have somebody run that.
I'll run it.
No!
You run it, Mackintosh.
And take all the credit when it comes in.
Where's Crossley now?
We have a surveillance team watching him at his house.
Why?
'Cause we're about to make an arrest.
For two murders.
Gus!
We can't go in there on a hunch.
Brace yourself, Ed, I'm about to blow your brilliant mind.
Your Detective Breitling was on the verge of bringing down Frank Crossley's empire.
Working his own private surveillance, he recorded and photographed something that changed everything.
Something big.
Bigger than the charges that put Crossley in a minimum-security prison for a few months this year.
Ooh!
No, those were a gift.
You'll get them back when I'm finished.
Yes!
I can see it all now.
Dangerous information.
So huge, he thought it could be the end of him.
So just in case something terrible or unexpected happened, he sent a copy to the Crown Prosecutor , fearful he was being watched.
Well, guess what?
Something terrible did happen, to both of them.
One was set up to look like an accident in Breitling's fishing cabin.
The other, an art theft.
Two deaths, seemingly unconnected.
A detective and a prosecutor.
Two men at either end of the dangerous information that would bring down a high-powered crime boss.
Please, Shawn, give those back.
I'm not quite finished, Mackintosh.
They're expensive.
Those are from Holland.
I need to button this thing and bring it home.
Shawn, I'm not kidding around.
Relax, dude.
Well, at least put on the strap.
Relax.
Give me the binoculars.
I'm not giving you the binoculars.
Well, at least put the strap on.
Crossley set up the guy who was banging his wife, Pierre Despereaux.
Is this how they do things in the States?
No.
No, usually it's much less professional.
He planted Despereaux's fingerprints and his signature cigarette!
And unfortunately he's right.
The courier did hand over a package to the Crown Prosecutor six days before his death.
It was picked up from a man with a badge matching Breitling's description.
Good.
We have enough to go into Crossley's house.
Mackintosh.
Let me guess.
Frank Crossley.
Okay, now I admit it.
He looks guilty.
How many more people are you going to let him kill?
I don't know, Gus.
Maybe one more, tops.
We are now accessories to two murders, two prison escapes, and helping him dangle a guy off a building.
There's no way dangling a guy off a building is in the criminal code.
Not in Canada.
Would you hurry up?
There's no way he got very far on foot.
He's in the car, isn't he?
Nope.
Through the gas tank, really?
No stone unturned, Shawn.
Well, you should probably check under that stone.
Uh-uh, do not take another step, Despereaux!
We are not going to help you escape this time.
I'm afraid that won't be necessary.
In the car.
I came to straighten things out with Frank and I found him dead.
Valeria setting up a crime scene, placing one of my signature cigarettes near the body.
That's the second time she's tried that, isn't it?
So you're the crime boss?
Yes.
I feel rather foolish now.
Are we going to get moving?
Or do I need to start shooting?
He managed to run his whole empire from inside, without missing a beat.
That's how Frank Crossley could run his empire from behind bars.
He didn't.
It was all a front for you.
That was the game-changing information that Breitling had on Crossley.
Just not Frank Crossley.
Valeria Crossley.
You were the one who was on to Breitling.
In the house!
And with the Crown Prosecutor involved, you had to kill them both.
You had the perfect patsy.
You knew he could break into anything because he's awesome.
As a nice bonus, he was also looking for love.
Well, I wouldn't say searching for love, per se.
It started out kind of animal, really.
Despereaux?
Hmm?
Let me finish.
Right.
In the midst of all this mess, your poor, unfortunate husband had to end the trail.
He was the final loose end.
And you still had the perfect patsy running around.
Don't go back.
I mean that as a compliment.
Thank you.
Run.
I was the pawn.
I can't be the pawn.
I really liked her.
Maybe I was looking for love.
Maybe you need to take a chance, put your heart on the line.
Oftentimes they turn out to be cold-blooded murderers, but sometimes they don't.
Any relationship is going to be a leap of faith.
It took me four years to figure that out.
Could you keep your voice down?
Honey?
You know I don't like loose ends.
I don't want to have to do this here.
You know, maybe we could be useful to each other, huh?
You, me.
Okay.
I'm going out.
When I get out there, you two make for the door, all right?
She'll kill you!
No, no, no, no, she'll kill you.
She won't kill me.
You see, Shawn, you were right, it is a leap of faith.
And I have faith she won't kill me.
I was wrong.
Don't take the chance.
Take the chance.
Take it now.
Don't take the chance.
I have a better idea.
So do I. You have zero ideas.
I'll get the door for him.
Right.
On the count of three.
One, two, three.
Darling, sweetheart, there are too many moving parts.
You can't stop them all.
Look, I have you, you have me.
Just let me have the gun.
Wow, that was flush.
Doin' all right?
See?
I told you she wouldn't kill me.
Yeah, true love.
Gus, we're good!
She's unconscious!
Stop running.
I don't know why you're smiling.
The charges in the States are every bit as steep as the ones here.
I find your confidence in the American justice system adorable.
They'll never convict me.
We'll convict you.
Sign again.
Oh, I look forward to a trial with no physical evidence.
Now, I want to pose a question to you, Shawn, and I want you to consider it sincerely.
Shoot.
Lunch.
Friday.
Mmm, I'll visit you in prison.
I'd schedule that sooner than later.
Let's go.
Lassie, where's Juliet?
She's meeting me at the airport.
Well, where is she now?
She went to go clear her head.
What am I, her social secretary?
Toodle-oo!
Hey.
You know, this bridge was built by porcupines.
They chewed the girders with their little teeth.
Apparently, there was like a rabies outbreak during construction.
They tried to unionize Shawn, can we not do this right now?
I'm really upset with you.
We just We missed the moment.
Some people just don't fit.
Yeah, but those are LEGO people.
And how could they?
I mean, they make so many different sizes for all the different sets.
They're in a box, they're in a bucket.
Then kids get them mixed up.
And don't even get me started on DUPLOs.
Those things are like twice the size.
You know, so babies won't eat them.
It's funny.
It's always funny.
Can we not do this right now?
It's okay.
The way things are.
It's okay.
I just really need to sort this out on my own right now.
Can I just say what I came here to say, please?
I have a motorcycle.
Yes.
You do.
Yes, I do.
And you know what?
It is It is the purest form of freedom that I have ever experienced.
You zip through traffic, you park anywhere, you never have to take anyone to the airport, you certainly don't have to help anyone move.
Easily the best purchase I've ever made in my life.
And I have never regretted it.
Not for one second.
Great.
You love your motorcycle.
Is there a point to this?
Yeah, there's a point.
The point is, since I met you, I've been thinking about getting a car.
And you're not thinking something practical or God, no.
Sensible?
I'm not throwing in the towel altogether.
This is awesome.
Oh!
Sorry.
We never do this.
Once we did it.
Well, I mean, not like this.
This is an escalation of anything that happened previously.
Maybe we should adjourn somewhere else.
Yes.
Is this on sale?
I don't work here.
I like your pearls.
You're very nice for a slut.
You know what?
Maybe now's not the time.
I have a flight in an hour.
Wait a minute.
I have a room.
A really nice one.
Paid for by a convicted criminal.
Why do you tell me these things?
Full disclosure.

{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Gus, you've been on this ride like 20 times.
Why are you chickening out now?
This ride just doesn't seem mechanically sound.
How do we know it's not going to break and eject us out of the building?
Gus, the ride is 12 inches off the ground.
Well, why are you nervous?
Because everybody knows that animatronic goblins can sometimes come to life in the weirdest of situations.
That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life.
No.
Really?
Yeah.
Then you go first.
You go first.
I want to go first, but not until you go.
You're doomed.
Doomed!
Doomed!
You didn't see that.
Perfect.
I am not comfortable with this.
Shh.
Jules, couples are supposed to have their hands all over each other at this stage.
At the beginning.
We do this now.
Eight hours from now, this could all be old hat.
Eventually, Carlton is going to find out about us.
I've seen his detective skills.
That could take years.
We should make a plan in case everyone finds out and we can't work cases together anymore.
I have a plan.
It's called never tell anyone.
Eventually everyone is going to know, and it is your fault that rule is in place.
If I hadn't outed Lassie's affair with his old partner, you wouldn't be here.
You think I haven't considered that?
Let's move to the cot.
Do you know who's been on that cot?
Do you know what they've done?
That is such an incredible buzz kill.
Oh, I'm sorry.
All right, no touching in the police station.
Actually, that's always been my rule.
I have a surprise for you.
You do?
Two tickets to Scare Fest tomorrow.
Opening day was sold out, so I got day two online.
You have been talking about it since they announced they were going to do another one, and I cannot wait to see that place through your eyes.
Oh, my God, you're going with Gus, aren't you?
Tonight.
But that's okay.
I'll go with both of you, and I'll scream just as loud with you as I do with Gus.
No, no, no.
It's fine.
I'll find something else for us to do.
It probably means a lot for you guys.
No, no, no, Jules, Jules, Jules.
I would I would much rather go with you obviously.
The two of us getting the beans scared out of us by disgruntled teenagers in Michael Myers masks?
Come on.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Gus will understand.
Oh, so you told him about us?
What, are you kidding?
That would be like posting it on my Facebook page, if I had a Facebook page or the desire to share intimate life details with people I'd avoid on the street.
I'm going to tell him.
I am.
And soon.
Try to understand, this is going to be like a bomb landing on his sweet head.
It means he's the odd man out again.
If I don't handle this delicately, he's bound to go on another caramel binge.
He went on one before?
Yes.
Hot and cold.
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.
Okay, just go with me here for a second.
I know this is going to sound crazy, but what I'm thinking is, we don't go to opening night of Scare Fest.
We go next week, maybe some time in the afternoon when it's not crowded at all.
Are you kidding?
I spent the entire week finishing my route early.
I took a vacation day.
Oh, no.
Gus, why would you do that?
You asked me to.
When?
The day they announced they were having Scare Fest again.
I don't recall that.
I have your speech as a video file on my BlackBerry, Shawn.
All right, okay, enough with all the technology.
The truth is, it's my horoscope.
It says I should avoid places with urinal troughs, and I just don't feel like I can take the risk right now.
I'm sure you understand.
Are you crying?
I'm disappointed, Shawn.
God.
Got you, man.
Of course we're going to Scare Fest.
Come on, man, you and me.
Opening day.
Sweet.
Just got to keep it between us, though.
What?
Nothing!
Come on!
Come on!
The first ones through the gates.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah, it's generally scarier once the sun actually goes down.
You've been so nervous lately.
You haven't been to the office in the last Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
You didn't even let me finish my question.
What's wrong What do I have to hide?
My joy that we have Scare Fest back for the first time in 15 years?
Whenever you're lying, you never let me finish my sentences Gus, don't be ridiculous.
Where are we going to do first, huh?
Where are we going first?
Yeah!
Come on, Gus, you know ring toss has never been your thing.
My carpal tunnel was acting up, Shawn.
Okay.
It was.
What are you doing?
Who are you hiding from?
Ken, our old assistant.
I promised I'd give him a personal reference for this IBM job.
I just remembered I never called the IBM guy back.
I guess he didn't get that job.
Nice going.
Dude, you, me, haunted house.
Let's ride some rides.
Wait a second, wait a second.
We haven't even had any churros yet.
This year they're wrapping them in bacon.
Didn't we come here to be scared?
Exactly.
What's more scary than a churro wrapped in bacon?
You're stalling.
No, I'm not.
You're stalling.
No, I'm not.
Let's go.
Would you have some respect for yourself?
Get in there.
These things being so snug.
Ah!
Um, excuse me, this lap bar is constricting my blood flow.
Safety is priority one at Scare Fest.
Yes, but this bar is acting as a tourniquet on my right leg.
Take it up with my boss.
Would you relax?
What's wrong with you?
What's going to happen when I need to unharness myself after this car is inevitably jettisoned out to the midway?
This car is traveling three miles per hour.
Nice.
Dude, you're not even looking.
I'm drinking it all in.
Your eyes are closed and you're pretending to be startled by things.
I was just startled.
By what?
The exit light?
That guy's shockingly real-Iooking.
Giant spider on your head.
Did a pretty good job, I got to say.
Wait a minute.
Gus, did you see that?
I was testing my watch to see if it really glowed in the dark.
Gus, I just saw somebody get killed.
Gus!
Gus!
I can't open this thing!
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?

There is a murderer loose in the haunted house.
You got to shut this ride down right now.
Okay, first of all, calm down.
I understand you're a little freaked out, but if you'll notice, there's a sign outside that says the word "spooky".
That means there's a murder in there about every 25 seconds.
Well, actually, every 45, since half the animation isn't working yet.
You're not listening.
I just saw a man gasping for his life.
You saw a volleyball on a broomstick.
No.
Yes, I saw that, too.
The illusion actually played.
But this is something different.
Did you see it?
I was previously engaged.
He didn't see anything.
Listen I'm sure Todd is pretty dreamy even though he can't spell "bitching".
But I'm assuming that, just like heaven and exhaling, he can wait.
You know what?
Our job is to scare.
And by the look on your face, I'd say we did a pretty good job.
So unless you have 38 more tickets to ride again, I suggest you get lost.
You're going to feel bad.
Yeah.
You're going to feel silly and bad.
Awful.
That girl was mean.
You try making minimum wage and having to wear that uniform.
See how friendly you are.
Let's just go.
Shh.
Man.
Ken!
No way.
Yes way.
In a big way.
Can I have your keys?
What?
I just saw a guy get killed.
Where?
In the murder room of the haunted house.
Isn't that what's supposed to happen?
Real guy.
Real murder.
Did you tell anyone?
We told Carol.
She was so busy texting with bad-grammar Todd that she didn't care.
Will you let that go?
"Bitching," Gus.
Bit-ching.
It's the only word I insist people get right.
Otherwise, you're saying it's "bi-chin".
Which is Chinese for "too much face.
" Isn't that right, Ken?
Seriously, dude, I already told you last time, six words.
Now why don't you just go tell someone else?
We're telling you, Ken.
And you want to know why?
Because it's high time that we get the team back together, man.
This is the kind of big-money case that will allow us to hire back our best Asian assistant ever.
3 Ninjas: Mega Mountain reunited, and it feels so good.
I like that song.
I'm only allowed to use these access keys for business.
Murder is our business.
Dude, I could get fired or worse.
Or you could get yourself back in the detective game.
I never have actually been able to do a case.
That is what I'm talking about.
Hey, what are you doing?
The key.
Are you serious, Shawn?
Don't cause a commotion.
Are you in?
I'm out.
So am I. I didn't ask you.
This is as far as I go.
Have it your way.
I'll close the door behind you.
Get it in here!
All right, Gus, don't be scared.
Do you have any idea how dangerous this is?
They're going to find a dead body, all right.
Mine.
Dragged by one of these ride cars.
You'll be the first documented dragging death at three miles per hour.
Actually, I'll be the third.
In 1974, there was a guy I can't do this with you right now Fine.
Here, in the ride.
Blend in.
My eye!
What are you saying?
"My eye"?
Are you saying "My eye" at the end?
I let out a very eerie "Arr.
" It wasn't eerie.
And then I added a layer to intimate that my eye had been removed or something horrifying like that.
Or that you had a loose eyelash or possibly a sty.
Eyes are scary on a psychological level, Shawn.
So you're warning riders on the dangers of conjunctivitis?
What?
You can do better?
I believe I can.
Please.
Wait for it.
Wait for it These goblins smell like bacon.
What the hell does that mean?
I have no idea.
You do smell like bacon.
You smell like bacon.
Smell yourself.
What the Why do I smell like bacon, Shawn?
I don't know, but it's not good.
It happened right there.
He's in here.
I don't understand it, Gus.
I I know what I saw.
I will never let you live this down.
I know what I saw, Gus.
I can't believe this.
I can't believe this.
I'm in carnival jail.
What are you so worried about?
It's not like they're going to call our parents or something.
Holy crap.
Dad!
What the hell is going on, Shawn?
Well, I'm at Scare Fest.
Oh, I know.
Park security just called.
They called you?
That's what they do, Shawn.
They call the police when they bust somebody.
You're just lucky I picked up.
I'm on my cell now.
Listen, I witnessed a murder, okay?
Where?
In the haunted house.
Dad, I'm serious.
There was a struggle.
It was terrible.
Did Gus see it, too?
No.
Anybody else?
It was very dark in there.
Shawn, you know how you get all worked up at those things.
Thanks a lot.
Damn.
We're going to get arrested, aren't we?
Gus, don't be the only black lead on a major cable network.
My dad's never had me arrested.
Yes, he has, Shawn.
You're right.
We need to get out of here.
All right, you're going to squeeze through this window and then, uh, circle around to the front of the building.
Then what?
I don't know.
Create a diversion.
Throw up on a baby, sing really loudly, pee in the dunk tank.
My arm couldn't fit through there, Shawn.
Are you kidding?
It's not like you're wearing floaties.
You can squeeze through that like old toothpaste.
I'm going to give you a push.
I've seen this work plenty of times.
Where?
On Winnie the Pooh?
And other places.
Oh, my gosh.
Gentlemen, come with me.
You see.
You see?
Could be halfway to Del Taco by now.
Yeah.
See?
You just wanted to stand there talking nonsense.
When I heard two boys snuck onto a ride, I wasn't expecting this.
Why?
Because he's black?
What are you doing?
I'm playing the race card.
Even if that was okay for you, you're playing it wrong.
I doubled down.
Thought you saw a murder?
Hmm.
Okay, you were trying to do the right thing, I guess.
You imagined something.
I do too sometimes.
It is a haunted house, after all.
So, just fill out these forms and I'll make sure you're on your way.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What are you writing?
Dude, what is wrong with you?
Will you leave it alone?
It's just your stupid imagination running wild.
Gus, I know what I saw, and I am the best observer that you know.
Last week, you thought a sponge in the Psych office was an owl.
If you'd stop buying them in bird colors, that would stop happening.
That's the guy.
He's the one I saw get murdered.
Right there on the wall.
That's the park president.
We've been looking for him for an hour and a half.
What?
He missed a big meeting with creditors.
What do you think about that?
Hmm?
Shut down the haunted house.
It was right here.
He was dragged away from the track.
And where were you hiding when all this took place?
I wasn't hiding.
But my head was down.
I was trying to avoid deep vein thrombosis.
That's not a thing, Gus.
It is a thing, Shawn.
People die from it on planes when they're not sitting in first class.
He's over here!
Well, as much as, "Good work, Spencer," pains me No, no, no, this is all wrong.
What do you mean?
This is the other side of the ride.
There's no way he stumbled this far.
And there was no mask.
The mask is Mr. Wayland's.
He loves Scare Fest.
He used to put on the costumes and jump out and scare the customers.
Did he ever use any scary eye imagery?
No.
But he once got stuck in a suit of armor in the castle.
He loved to tell that story to the new hires.
I bet he did.
Looks like he might have gotten caught in these retractable wires in the dark.
Three miles per hour, my ass.
I told you it was a dangerous place to be in.
What a shame.
But it just goes to show that kids should be scared by the law, not adults in costumes.
Are you kidding me right now, Lassie?
I report that a man is strangled to death here, then a dead guy shows up with marks on his neck and you won't believe that it's murder?
Fine.
It's under consideration.
We have a bona fide Scooby-Doo case that has fallen into our laps.
Dead guy, haunted house, amusement park.
Gus, say "zoinks".
I'm not saying "zoinks".
Then say "jinkies".
Jinkies.
We were on this ride together and we saw this man killed.
I am not a liar About this.
I'm not lying about the dead man.
For you, I have an explanation.
For what?
Nothing.
Oh, murder.
I knew it.
Pardon me, did you just say this man was murdered?
Not only that, but I I know who the killer is.
Okay, everyone stop what they're doing.
You guys You two, shut it down in the back there.
Please, sir, tell all these doubters and Scooby-Don'ts who killed this man.
It's Johnny Ricketts.
Johnny Ricketts.
Lassie, get an APB out.
Your suspect's name is Jonathan Ricketts.
Was.
I'm sorry?
His name was John.
This man was killed by the ghost of John Ricketts.
Hmm.
I'm good here.
Fellows, wrap it up.
Spencer, you're on your own again.
Zoinks.
You know, you could have just told me you were coming with Gus.
You didn't have to lie.
Well, it wasn't a lie initially.
Then, you came with Gus.
That's when it became a lie.
I couldn't disappoint him.
Oh, Whack-A-Mole.
Understand, Jules, Gus gets his heart set on things.
That's how I ended up at Clogapalooza last Saturday.
I thought you were kidding about that.
See?
That's a truth that you didn't believe.
It's like a lie in reverse.
It's all very confusing.
Shawn.
I promise it will not happen again.
The lying.
And Clogapalooza.
Mostly the lying.
Clogapalooza was So you told Gus about us?
You, ma'am!
Allow the Great Mesmerato to guess your age, guess your weight.
Oh, you know, I'm I'm kind of in the middle of something Just one shot, ma'am.
I'm really good.
We have our own stuff going on.
Just one shot.
Is everyone here ready?
Okay.
Fine.
Make it quick.
One hundred and What?
Are you crazy?
Am I too high or too low?
There should be a three-pound margin of error.
I have a gun.
Jules, don't sweat it.
Look at him.
Guy's a complete hack.
Come on.
Oh, my God, that is totally right.
Mesmerato!
Thanks a lot, dude.
Good work from you.
Feel good about yourself.
What's up with Juliet?
Nothing.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
All right, look, Gus, it's time for me to share some news with you.
You've probably figured this out yourself already, but something happened in Canada, something really good.
Right.
We captured Despereaux.
Right.
That happened, but I'm talking about something else.
Things are going to be a little different around here.
Great.
Maybe you'll start to make sense sometime soon.
I've been looking for you.
We need to talk.
Listen, sir, it is all in my statement.
We're never sneaking into the haunted house again.
It's clearly a dangerous place What What can we do for you, Mr. Holloway?
Not here.
Oh, my God.
Thank God you think it's Ricketts, too.
I thought I was going crazy.
You're not going crazy.
You are crazy.
A ghost didn't kill this guy.
A goblin possibly, maybe a vampire.
Who is this Johnny Ricketts person?
Johnny Ricketts was a 15-year-old kid who fell from the Ferris wheel in 1995.
It stopped at the top while other passengers were loading, and he tried to switch seats or something, and he mis-stepped, and he fell 60 feet and he died right there.
It was a nightmare.
That was the last time we did Scare Fest.
Until now.
Well, that's right.
I mean, when David said that he wanted us to do Scare Fest again, I refused.
I just didn't think it was the right thing to do.
But then he insisted.
And you caved.
Well, there wasn't really much I could say.
I mean, he's the president, and Scare Fest had always been the big moneymaker.
I mean The park had been losing money year after year consistently, and he said if we didn't go through with it, we were going to go under.
So, we did.
Even after it started happening.
After what started happening?
I started seeing him in weird places and hearing him in my sleep and through the crackling on the phone.
Wayland?
Ricketts.
He'd come back.
He was trying to tell me something.
I know exactly what this dude was trying to say.
Mr. Holloway, you may want to consider taking some kind of therapy.
I'm sorry.
Are you some sort of a doctor?
No, but I work with a lot of doctors.
What are we talking about?
Actually, I do see a therapist Once a week.
Well, maybe you want to start doubling that up and consider taking some anti-psychotics.
I could recommend a few good generic brands.
I mean, just because you're delusional, there's no reason for you to overpay.
That's actually pretty thoughtful.
You know, I understand that you think I'm imagining this.
That's what David thought, too.
Until he saw him.
Until he saw Ricketts?
Yes!
That's what I'm trying to tell you!
That's why I brought you here.
Ricketts has been here!
In the park!
In this office!
Maybe you want to consider an in-house program.
Have you seen Girl Interrupted?
Gus, please.
Have you seen Cuckoo's Nest or Crazy People?
Boat Trip.
Boat Trip Boat Trip?
Yes.
The gay cruise ship movie with Sanz and Cuba Gooding, Jr. How does that play?
It doesn't.
I just wanted to know if anyone else saw it besides me.
I'm guessing no.
You sound just like David did before he found this.
You don't really think a ghost did this, do you?
Gus, don't be your jury summons I accidentally threw in the trash last month, along with something called a W-2.
It's never a ghost.
Holloway is hiding behind the ghost of Johnny Ricketts.
But we all know ghosts are transparent.
Is that supposed to mean something?
It was a vague metaphor.
It's confusing.
Maybe to you.
Shawn, I figured it out.
Congratulate me.
Congratulations.
We also have some insight into the Wayland murder.
It's the pants.
They're not slimming.
They're like horizontal stripes.
They add like 10 pounds.
Jules, are you still thinking about the guess-your-weight guy?
He was right about everybody else, right down to the pound.
It's a sham.
I promise.
Like everyone knows, there are plants in the audience, complete ruse.
I don't even think his real name is Mesmerato.
Preliminary forensics are in on Wayland.
We're going with homicide.
Reports in the file.
I'm going to follow up on a witness, then we can head out.
Lassie Why don't you just admit I was right?
Hmm.
I checked on Johnny Ricketts for you.
Thank you.
Wasn't much, a few accounts from employees, Holloway included.
Holloway gave a statement?
Yeah.
He was working the ride that night.
His statement's pretty consistent with the others.
Ultimately, his death was ruled accidental and the park wasn't held liable, but they never held Scare Fest again.
Clyde, Lugs, and Pembrook!
Johnny Ricketts did kill Wayland.
Did you just use the characters from Stroker Ace as an interjection?
Don't interrupt.
But you didn't use Stroker Ace.
I can't do this with you right now.
I got to When David told us that we were going to do Scare Fest again, I refused.
It just didn't seem right.
But he insisted.
And there's not much I can say.
He's the president.
It wasn't Ricketts.
It was Holloway posing as Ricketts.
See, Wayland was running the park into the ground.
Holloway wanted to take over, so he killed Wayland and pinned it on the ghost of Johnny Ricketts.
You just said it's never a ghost.
That's right.
It's never a ghost.
Why don't you listen to me?
I am.
You're not making any sense.
Your face doesn't make sense.
Let's go.
Eve, where's Holloway?
He's not here.
He was staring out the window during our meeting, and then he just walked off.
He made a beeline for the flume ride.
The flume ride.
We need to see him now!
Excuse us!
Excuse us!
Excuse us!
Come on, Gus!
It's crazy.
He just raced up the stairs and into the ride while it was still running.
Why would he do that?
I don't know.
I've got something.
Dude That's Johnny Ricketts.
We are two homicides deep on this case and it's all hands on deck.
We've executed a police order to temporarily shut down the park.
We're seeking information on this suspect.
We're going to be scouring the designated area in two-man teams.
We are going to sniff out this reprobate and cuff him where he stands.
Now let's go.
That was an exquisite briefing, Detective.
Beautifully enunciated.
You are an artist and briefs, your medium.
Though I suspect you could squeeze into a small if you had to.
Thank you, Spencer.
Thank you very much.
Even your compliments are insults.
I sure hope all that scouring you spoke of involves Gus and myself.
You know, now that you mention it, there is something I'm needing from you two.
What?
Your absence.
Wow.
I know.
How long do you think he's been waiting to use that one?
Weeks.
Maybe months.
Come on, Gus.
Someone around here is bound to know something.
There's hardly anyone here, Shawn.
Lassiter shut the park down.
Well, in that case, I think we should find ourselves a funnel cake.
Ken!
Hard at work, I see.
Yeah, they kept a few of us around for the cleanup.
Well, it's good to see that you're still working.
I'm done tonight.
Sorry to hear that, Ken.
If there's anything we can do Really?
Well, how about finding me another job and then getting me fired.
We can go for the trifecta.
Come on now, Ken.
No.
You know what?
I get it now, Shawn.
It's not that you don't want me to work for you.
It's that you don't want me to work at all.
Ken, we're serious.
You call us if you need anything.
Except for a job.
Maybe a job.
We're not hiring.
We might be hiring.
We're a little underfunded in the human resources department.
Look, you guys mind if I get back to work?
We'd love for you to get back to work.
As long as we're not the ones employing you.
But first, can you tell us anything about this nasty Johnny Ricketts business?
Who?
Johnny Ricketts.
Kid who died on the Ferris wheel back in '95.
Oh, yeah.
I heard about that.
Yeah, my parents were talking about it when they were changing my diapers.
Gus, is there anything cuter than a Chinese baby?
What's wrong with you, Shawn?
We think that Ricketts is connected to both Wayland's and Holloway's deaths.
Why are you guys even asking me?
I've worked here for exactly four days.
If you really want to know about this place, why don't you look in the archives or something?
They document everything.
I know exactly where to look.
Come on, Ken, we'll need someone to get us in.
Really, Shawn?
I'm already fired.
You want to get me double fired?
That's impossible.
Seriously, dude, you need help.
State agency, what are you looking at?
Doesn't it strike you as odd that there appear to be no state investigation into Ricketts' death?
It was ruled an accident.
You said so yourself.
Yeah, yeah, by the park.
There was no official report released by the state.
And they always look into these things.
Look, O'Hara, it was a long time ago.
I know.
I know, but it does seem peculiar.
Maybe Shawn's right.
About what?
He and Guster think they're in some cartoon mystery show with a talking Great Dane and a psychedelically painted van.
Scooby-Doo?
Is that why he keeps calling me Velma?
Oh, probably.
Oh.
Point is, there is a flesh-and-blood killer out there.
We're not going to find him looking in old files.
Don't have to lecture me on police work, Carlton.
I know.
You're the second best detective we have by a wide margin.
Um, thank you.
And that's because up until now you've managed to keep Spencer and his antics at arm's length.
See, that is the key to dealing with him.
That, and maintaining the psychological upper hand at all times.
He's calling you Velma.
I'm choosing my battles.
So am I. Really?
Because lately it seems like you're backing him a little more than usual.
I am behind him exactly as much as I need to be.
He has solved a lot of cases for us.
Don't you see that?
Tell me what I should see.
You see your partner following a lead.
From Spencer?
It's all police work, Carlton.
Right.
And global warming is real.
Global warming is real.
Sure it is.
Look, all I'm saying is that it's fine that we're all on the same team, as long as we're on the same team.
Didn't I just say I'm your partner?
Yes.
Then you have nothing to worry about.
Good.
Because listening to Spencer is almost always a trip down the rabbit hole.
You see?
I told you you could squeeze through this window.
Why do I always have to do it first?
Give me a hand.
Let's not make this a thing.
You can go first next time.
I did go first.
Then why are you complaining?
Uh, all right, we're looking for any kind of documentation from the night Ricketts died.
Juliet showed us the documentation.
Not all of it.
Well, go see if you can find anything in Holloway's office.
I'm not going through a dead man's office.
It's not like he's going to walk in or something.
See if you can find our statements.
What are you worried about?
For your information, Shawn, I'll have you know my record is spotless.
I may run for office some day.
Fine.
Oh, boy.
Gus, check it out.
Eve was here the night Ricketts died.
What are you eating?
Nothing.
You don't want to go through a dead man's office, but you'll eat his candy?
It's grandma candy, Shawn.
Nobody's going to want it.
It's so shiny.
Look how shiny the orange What did you find, Shawn?
Look, Holloway made Eve falsify her statements.
It's her hand, but not her handwriting.
Check out the eights.
Now look at the eight in the date next to her signature.
Boom.
Wow.
What?
All right.
Wait a second.
What?
What is this?
You know I don't speak algebra.
It's a money transfer.
$350,000, right after the incident.
Or is it a fine?
And who did it go to?
Johnny Ricketts' family.
Holloway must have paid him off.
A little Halloween hush money.
This was no accident, Shawn.
What's that?
The same amount.
Maybe they asked for more.
No.
No.
No, this is going to someone different.
Jaime Emerson?
Jaime Emerson.
Wow.
What is Wonder Woman's real name?
What are you What are you hiding for?
We broke into someone's office, Shawn.
What do you think you're doing in here?
Did you just break into our office?
No.
Why would you ask that?
Because he's black?
Sorry?
Eve, I am a psychic.
We work for the Santa Barbara Police Department.
And I know you have a secret, a dark secret.
The same secret that Wayland and Holloway took to their graves.
I was drawn here by Jaime Emerson.
Where did you get that name?
We know about the payouts.
The payouts after Ricketts died on the Ferris wheel.
I warned them.
The decorations were in the way.
The door didn't close right.
We know you paid Jaime Emerson off, too.
Why?
Was she there that night?
Was she a reporter?
An employee?
What?
Eve, you can't run away from this.
That was a strange reaction.
No death certificate.
No arrest record.
Jaime Emerson is the ghost.
Not Johnny Ricketts.
Dude!
Did you just rub my leg?
What?
Don't be ridiculous.
I rub you, it's going to be above the forehead.
You must have rubbed your own leg.
Why would I do that?
I don't know.
You're always talking about your quads.
I am not I do not talk about my quads.
Shawn, just tell him.
Tell What?
That's too weird.
Weirder than rubbing his quads.
What are you all talking about?
Nothing.
Juliet has requested DMV information on Jaime Emerson.
Jules, you brought my dad in on this?
Despite all appearances, Shawn, we don't want to believe you're crazy.
No driver's license.
Just a California ID.
Yeah, she's not allowed to drive because of an injury.
She was there that night.
And she's taking them out one by one.
Who's taking who out?
Johnny Ricketts.
I mean, not the real Johnny.
It's supposed to look like Johnny Ricketts.
Shawn, you're not making sense.
Dad, Johnny Ricketts was not alone on the Ferris wheel that night that he died.
It wasn't an accident.
It was negligence.
And everyone who was there is going down.
Everyone who was there is dead.
Everyone but Eve.
We have to get to the fairgrounds.
I'm going to get Lassiter.
Stay put.
Are we really waiting for Lassiter?
That would be a first.
Eve!
Eve!
Eve!
Eve!
Oh, I don't know, man.
We might be too late.
Do you think Eve is still here?
Eve!
Eve!
Eve!
Eve!
Eve?
Eve?
Eve, you all right?
Are you okay?
I I've seen him.
Ricketts.
We know.
No, no, no, not just tonight.
I've been seeing him for weeks.
I couldn't admit it.
I felt so guilty.
You didn't see Johnny Ricketts.
I wake up at night and I see him out my window.
I hear his voice over my phone.
I know who I see.
I know it looks like him, but you're not actually seeing Ricketts.
Then who do I see?
Turn around, but be very careful.
Carol.
You can call her by her real name, Jaime Emerson.
You were the girl.
Oh, honey, I am so sorry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she was on that ride, too.
Johnny wasn't screwing around on the Ferris wheel that night.
He was trying to help me.
The latch wasn't safe.
They both fell.
You survived, he didn't.
The park knew they were liable for the accident.
You have to believe me, Mr. Wayland thought it would be best.
Keep it shut.
You've had 15 years to come clean.
They paid off all the parents for their silence.
Three hundred and fifty grand for each and it was over for them.
That may have covered your medical expenses, but not your suffering.
Nothing was going to bring Johnny back.
And now they decided to bring back Scare Fest, so callously forgetting all the damage they left in their wake.
You snapped.
Anyone would have.
Even Holloway kept thinking they were seeing Johnny Ricketts, but what they really saw was you in a baseball cap.
You didn't just want to kill them.
You wanted a preamble, so they knew exactly why they were being killed.
I never wanted your money.
You needed to pay.
You all needed to pay.
They made me lie.
I have regretted it ever since.
You can say whatever you want.
You're still going with them.
Knife!
Grab it!
Grab it!
Jaime, let it be over.
The only thing I can't figure out is how you were at two places at the same time.
What are you talking about?
How did she manage to operate the ride and kill Wayland at the same time, Gus?
Abracadabra!
Never mind.
I think I got it.
I understand you're a little freaked out right now, but if you'll notice the sign outside says the word "spooky".
Todd, right?
Todd.
B- l-T-C-H-l-N apostrophe.
You forgot the "T".
What you texted was "Bichin".
Wait a second, you're the guess-your-weight guy.
You dressed up as Ricketts, too?
Yeah.
They both did.
To keep the memory of Johnny Ricketts alive to the people they blame for his death.
What are we going to do now, babe?
We can't kill two more.
We have to.
Go!
Get them!
Come on!
Come on!
Gus, seeing as how we might be dying at any moment, I have a confession to make.
Remember when you got bummed out when I started seeing Abigail?
You thought things between us were going to change, and you ate all those waffles to try and deal with it.
What the hell are you talking about, Shawn?
I don't think there's really time for this.
I hooked up with Juliet.
So?
So?
We're breaking up the duo.
It's not just Shawn and Gus anymore.
Now it's more like the Say Say Say video.
You've been after her for five years.
Five years?
He's really not that smooth.
Oh, I'm not that smooth?
"Hey, you hear about Pluto?
"That's messed up, right"?
How many times has that landed?
Guys!
Guys!
That's a player's move, Shawn.
It's not a player's move.
That's like an astronomer's move.
Look, Jules and I are an item now.
The least you could do is show some emotion.
Wait a second, you're mad at me for not being mad?
I'm shocked at you for not being shocked.
And I'd like you to be a little sad because I'm a little sad.
What do you care what your friend thinks?
You know what, Eve?
I don't care.
I I don't care.
I don't care.
Hey, we got a big problem here.
Ask me how much I don't care, Todd!
I care, Todd!
I care!
You care about Todd and his little gun?
Yes!
Yes, I do, Shawn!
Your priorities are way out of whack, my friend.
What's wrong with you guys?
Ooh!
my ass!
I got the tiny girl with the limp.
Nice, Lassie.
Well, it's easy.
She doesn't run very fast.
Really good work.
We'll finish this conversation later.
Jules, I won't lie to you.
It was difficult, but I finally told Gus about us.
And how did he take it?
Shock and bewilderment.
Hmm.
Like the first six minutes of Saving Private Ryan, followed by the last five minutes of Lady in the Water.
No, it wasn't.
I totally saw it coming, just like Lady in the Water.
Sure you did.
Now are you going to tell us the same thing about Private Ryan?
The Normandy Invasion?
Yeah, I knew that one, too.
Liar.
It's a historical fact.
Maybe to you.
Maybe to the 20th century.
Look, the important thing is that it is now out in the open.
No more sneaking around.
No more secrets.
I absolutely agree.
No more secrets, Jules.
Except from Lassiter, which means Gus can come clean about how shocked he was.
I wasn't shocked.
You will be.
Pretty sure I won't.
He's playing it cool.
Mmm.
Maybe I was wrong.
Hey, are you eating caramel in there?
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Dude, do you know they make silent window shades?
Some woman in Washington invented them back in the early '90s.
Since when is the sound of opening and closing shades so disruptive that it has to be alleviated?
Why do you have to hate on other peoples triumphs of innovation?
Weird.
It's not weird, it's selfish and more than a little petty.
No, not that, come take a look at this.
Man, this better not be another auction for one of Stoney Jackson's neckerchiefs.
It's not, Shawn.
This came in on the Psych account.
The sender is "me-at-under-the-nail- dot-com".
I'm pretty sure it's not spam.
Well, what's the attachment?
Cinnamon festival.
The Great Northern.
I'm not familiar with that publication.
What, you know every small town newspaper in California?
Actually, I do, Shawn.
Ridgecrest?
The Daily Independent.
Shawnopolis.
That doesn't exist.
Yet.
I just need 50,000 signatures and a large plot of land.
Well, look up this town, Dual Spires.
I mean, how can there be a cinnamon festival that we've never heard of?
Zoom in.
Zoom in again.
Keep zooming.
I am, Shawn.
Dude, this town is so small that it's in parenthesis.
How the heck did we get this email?
It's a delicious mystery.
Think about it, a tiny little town we've never even heard of?
What's your schedule look like?
I'm open till my route tomorrow.
Let's see here.
You think they'll have monkey bread?
Yes, I do.
What?
I'm good till next WrestleMania.
We circled three times.
There's no road that leads to Dual Spires.
I don't think this place exists.
I think someone with the knowledge of our cinnamon weakness is messing with us.
I wouldn't call it a weakness.
I mean, there's the world's tastiest spice, Gus.
The job after nutmeg is quite significant.
Dude, we're going for a walk in a forest.
Dude.
Half a mile from the nearest road.
No wonder it's in parenthesis.
This is one secluded town.
Let's get some cinnamon.
Wow.
Everyone looks so happy, and yet, so perplexed.
Something's off about this place, Shawn.
People keep looking, like I'm the first black man they've seen.
Come on, Gus.
Don't be absurd.
Hey mister, are you Frederick Douglass?
Shawn, we need to get out of here.
Nah, let's get something to eat.
Hey, top of the morning to you, boys.
Robert Barker.
You can call me Bob.
Just passing through?
We're here for the festival.
We take our cinnamon very seriously.
Well, then you're in luck, because so do we.
Ninety years running.
Why do you call your diner The Sawmill?
'Cause that's what it used to be.
Most of it burned down back in '58.
Granddad turned it into this place, and now it's just a bit of a local landmark.
We just need a little something to hold us over until show time, so, uh, what's good?
How about a cup of the best pipin' hot apple cider this side of the Mississippi and a slice of cinnamon pie that may just bring tears?
Two slices of cinnamon pie, hon.
That's the wife.
Isn't she a peach?
Ah, I'll get that cider.
Bob's a real Chatty Cathy.
You think?
You should check your email.
See if our secret pal sent us any cinnamon comps.
I'm afraid you won't have much luck with those here.
Sheriff Andrew Jackson.
You know, we had the opportunity to put up some of those fancy towers, but folks decided a basic landline was fine with them.
I couldn't help but overhear that you're in town for the festival.
It's rare to get visitors.
Well, we heard all about it on underthenail.
com.
We don't have the Internet in Dual Spires.
It's simpler that way.
Dude, we're doing Witness.
They were Amish.
Not Danny Glover, he was black.
What are you talking about?
Well, we are happy you're here, nevertheless.
It should be a heck of a celebration.
Two slices of cinnamon pie.
Oh, thank you.
Well, we'll see you at the festival.
Sheriff.
What's the verdict?
Really?
Mmm.
Oh, mother of God.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm.
Dude, that owl is made entirely of cinnamon.
Which means that it is both wise and delicious.
Let's have a nice, warm round of applause for Mayor Douglas Fir.
And, this year's festival mascot, Leo, the cinnamon owl.
You found the monkey bread.
You know that's right.
And now, the moment I know you've all been waiting for.
It's time to announce this year's Cinnamon King.
Who-oo will it be?
Who, who, who?
Oh, who are we kidding?
Put your hands together for the future leader of Dual Spires.
A young man that needs no introduction, come up and claim your crown, Randy.
That's my boy.
What's 24 times 12?
Two-eighty-eight.
Why?
There's a chair here for every person in town.
Three are empty.
Sheriff's talking, so that's one.
Check it out.
There's one right next to the Barkers.
Hey.
Hey, you found the monkey bread.
Yeah.
Mrs. Barker, is everything okay?
No.
Everything is not okay.
Shelley.
What?
I can't just sit here and pretend to be excited about churros and Leo the cinnamon owl.
I sense someone is missing.
Yeah.
Our niece, Paula.
She's been gone about a day and a half.
Everyone keeps telling us not to panic.
She's a teenager.
Wait, what did you mean, you sensed it?
Mr. and Mrs. Barker, I have a confession to make.
I'm not just a cinnamon enthusiast.
I'm also a psychic detective.
And this is my partner, Lodge Blackmunn.
Can you find Paula?
Perhaps.
Oh!
I got a little something under the nail.
Right here, under Under the nail.
We are available for hire.
We don't have much money.
None of us do, here.
We believe it complicates things.
Well, we have been known to work for cider or pie in the past.
Oh, of course.
As much as you'd like.
We will find your niece.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Who is supposed to be sitting over there?
Oh, that's Paula's best friend, Jack.
I'm not sure where he is.
Would this be Something happened at the lake.
Something happened at the lake!
It's Paula.
I know it is.
Jack just discovered her, about an hour ago, Doc.
So young.
My God, Andrew.
Jack, is this how you found her?
No, sir.
She was half naked.
It wasn't right.
I didn't want people to see her like that.
I'm sorry.
Oh, now I've got to let the Barkers through.
No!
No, my baby.
Paula.
Paula!
Paula.
Come on, dude.
You know I'm a sympathetic crier, Shawn.
Just leave me be.
Dude, I have a bar.
And an email.
Gus, we weren't called here for a cinnamon festival.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know I know, you know I'm guessing the time of death was sometime night before last.
Doc Gooden will do a full autopsy.
You know she won't miss a thing, Bob.
But I suspect what we will find is that Paula went swimming after curfew, like she always did, and got pulled under by the current and hit her head.
I'm gonna rule it an accident for now.
She must have snuck out.
Bob, we both know she's been sneaking out just about every night since she got here.
Listen, why don't you take Michelle on home.
She's gonna need you to be strong now.
I'll get Deputy Frost to take you back in the rickshaw.
I'm so, so sorry, Bob.
Looks like we won't be needing your services after all, boys.
Mr. Barker, I am sensing there is more to Paula's death than meets the eye.
What are you saying?
That she Oh, my God.
We'd like to stick around.
See what we see.
Feel what we feel.
Okay.
If someone hurt Paula, we sure as hell want to know about it.
I'm also sensing that Paula didn't grow up here in Dual Spires.
May I ask where she was before?
Paula lived in Santa Barbara till she was 11.
Well, you have our condolences, and we will be in touch.
I think your ride is here.
The earth is soft and moist.
That is so bizarre.
It's like I only have reception in this spot.
In all my years of police work, I've never seen anything like it.
I know.
Our new station manager is an angel sent from heaven.
O'Hara.
Yes, Detective O'Hara.
Shawn Spencer calling.
Did you just use both of our last names?
Don't be weird.
Okay, Miss O'Hara.
Detective.
Shawn.
Look, I'm really struggling with the whole work formal thing.
What are you wearing?
Okay, you just took it from one awkward extreme to another.
I need you to run a name for a girl.
Used to live in Santa Barbara.
Paula Merral.
Two "r"s.
Sure, is everything okay?
Yeah, absolutely.
I'm gonna have to call you back, though, 'cause there's not really reception up here.
Up where?
Hello?
Jules.
Shawn?
Wow, it really is just the one spot.
Your conversations with Juliet are too uncomfortable to listen to now.
I'm calling next time.
Fine.
Look, if we're going to accomplish anything in this town, we are gonna need wheels.
Shawn, we have reached a new low point in our life.
Are you kidding me?
It's like Driving Miss Daisy.
Except you get to be Miss Daisy.
I don't want to be Miss Daisy, Shawn.
That means you're I don't wanna be Hoke either.
I guess you could be Ackroyd.
I don't wanna be in the movie, Shawn.
Looks like the doctor stays pretty busy.
Guess you're out of luck if you need a massage.
Good job saving your receipts, Patrick.
May I help you, gentlemen?
Hello, Doc Gooden.
My partner, plus too much cinnamon monkey bread equals tummy shame.
Can you help us?
I'll see him after my next patient.
Doc, this could get ugly fast.
All right.
Sheriff Jackson mentioned we had a couple of visitors in town today.
You are aware the cinnamon festival has been cancelled.
Oh, yes.
We heard there was some sort of tragedy.
Must be so difficult in a small, happy town like Dual Spires.
Put this on and then lay face down on my table.
Uh, well you know Ah, ahh!
Actually, I think Snap to it.
I'm not putting this on.
Fine.
So how well did you know the girl?
I'm sorry, I don't know why I do that.
I can just sense that you have a heavy heart.
I'm a woman of science.
And law.
And accounting.
But that doesn't mean that I don't feel.
Paula was a troubled young girl.
I wish I could have done more to help her.
You were her psychiatrist?
You ask a lot of questions.
It's just I recently lost someone myself.
He was murdered too, so I know how difficult Paula wasn't murdered.
Who told you that?
Oh, no one.
I just assumed, because I haven't done an autopsy yet.
There are no obvious signs of foul play.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to No, it's not you.
Like I said, she was a troubled young girl.
She had a dangerous side.
Nothing scared her.
Not even dying.
You think she may have taken her own No, I can't bear that thought.
I've said too much to a stranger.
I should be ashamed.
For caring?
No, you shouldn't.
You know, I actually feel better.
The myna bird can come in now.
You swear you made that sound through your mouth?
Yes, Shawn, I figured it was the path of least resistance.
Seems like a missed opportunity.
What's up next?
We need to find our cinnamon king.
That kid has a secret.
What did grandma tell you about wandering off in the store?
Oh, come on.
I was getting ready to say That would have been too much.
Shawn, this town is getting weirder by the minute.
Dude.
That's him.
Dude, that's our guy.
Oh, Sheriff.
Didn't expect to see you here.
I live here.
What do you mean?
Of course you do.
Oh You're Randy's father.
Yes, wow.
You guys have Bob Barker, Doc Gooden, and Randy Jackson.
All living in the same inlet town with no cars, cell phones, or internet.
Shawn, we need to pitch this to Mark Burnett.
You fellas realize the festival is canceled.
As you know, we lost someone very dear to us today.
That's actually why we dropped by, Sheriff.
You see, Gus and I are grief counselors back in the big city.
And you all have been so kind and welcoming to us that we figured the least we could do would be to offer our services before we left town.
Well, come on in, fellas.
Yeah.
I'll confess, Randy and I haven't been communicating too well as of late.
I know he's hurting, but he won't talk to me.
You know, it wasn't too long ago that Gus and I were Randy's age.
It was a pretty long time ago.
Ah, it wasn't that long ago.
You like to think so.
I can't do this with you right now.
Fine.
He's upstairs in his room.
We'll give it a shot.
So my dad hired you to shake me down, right?
I'm fine.
I barely knew Paula.
Then why did the two of you share secret, special lover earrings?
Come on, Randy.
How long had you been seeing her?
Who are you?
A couple of guys with a passion for the truth.
And cinnamon.
We'd been together six months.
Why was it a secret?
It's complicated.
I get it.
It's Pretty in Pink.
You're Andrew McCarthy.
Who's Andrew McCarthy?
That's fair.
Where were you the night Paula died?
I was at the library, studying.
The librarian can confirm it.
Do you always study so late on a Friday?
I'm at the library almost every night.
I've been taking correspondence courses.
I need a business degree to be a good leader.
That's true.
I never could have hurt her.
I loved Paula.
We were gonna see the world together.
I'm gonna be so lost without her.
Oh, Paula.
Paula.
Paula.
Paula.
Paula.
That's a little dramatic, don't you You have a problem.
Excuse us.
Keep your voice down, please.
It's just us and you.
Just a bunch of words on paper to you guys, right?
Wrong.
Each is alive with a story to tell.
Listen.
I'm just messing with you guys.
Thanks for playing along.
That's really sweet.
I'm Maudette Hornsby.
Isn't cherry the best?
The best what?
Everything, silly.
I thought you were psychic.
I am.
I'm the psychic.
But how did you know that?
Mmm, word travels.
You know, we don't get a lot of gossip around here.
So untimely death, a psychic, and a black man, all in one day.
Epic.
I really thought we were being discreet.
Do you even know what discreet is?
That's a serious question.
I know what Shh!
Was Randy Jackson with you the night Paula died?
Why?
Do you think she was M- U-R-D-E-R-E-D or something?
M- A-Y-B-E.
Yes, Randy was here.
We have a very special bond, you see.
His mom passed away when he was very young.
Sheriff Jackson never remarried.
So I sort of stepped in and filled a role.
For both of them.
Is there anything else you need to know?
Uh Feels pretty good for now.
Do you mind if we poke around?
Poke?
Peek.
Peek.
Peek around.
Yes.
Knock yourselves out.
Okay, remember the last email, the one with all the weird hieroglyphics?
They were letters and numbers, Shawn.
Okay, it was one of these things.
The Dewey Decimal System?
I didn't even know they still used this.
That's 'cause people don't want to crack war codes when the payoff is Jane Eyre.
What was the number, Shawn?
F-7-9-6-dot-3-5-2.
Seven hundred's that's sports and recreation.
These books are archaic.
And really old.
Except this one.
By Earl Wyndam.
My short game could use some work.
There's no pictures?
This is the weirdest golf book I've ever seen.
Let me see that.
Our emailer wants us to think that Paula was reincarnated?
We should get back to the lake.
Juliet should have something by now.
You're gonna need a library card if you want to check something out.
I think we're good, Maudette.
Juliet, it's Gus.
Gus, what's going on?
Is Shawn okay?
Oh, he's fine.
Tell her I said "Hi".
Ask her what she's wearing.
Do you have anything on Paula Merral?
Do I?
Look, I don't know what you guys have gotten yourselves into up there, but Paula Merral drowned here seven years ago.
What?
Did she say "Hi" back?
Is he looking at us?
I think he is.
Dude, take it easy.
That's your seventh piece.
You know I get hungry when I get freaked out.
Besides, you've had five.
Exactly, I believe in portion control.
A girl drowns, gets reincarnated, and drowns again seven years later?
Worst cinnamon festival ever.
We definitely stick out around here.
True, but not as bad as them.
What are you staring at, Jesup?
Scoot.
Wow, did you guys just hoof it from the highway?
What?
Oh, hell no.
No, we took the seven-mile dirt road that connects this crap hole to the next town over.
We came up here because the chief wanted us to get a positive ID on Paula Merral's body.
To see if it matched the one found in Santa Barbara?
No, see that's the thing.
We never recovered her body.
Which didn't sit well with me.
The inlet where she supposedly drowned has no current, which means her body should have floated up between 2.3 to 3.1 days.
Oh, I know this because waiting for corpses to resurface is a passion in my life.
The sweater she was wearing was found on the shoreline.
And her bike was discovered at the end of a nearby dock.
It was lying next to a pile of sunflower seeds, which was also weird.
What 11-year-old girl chews sunflower seeds?
Excuse me, Flo.
Where might we find the proprietors of this fine establishment?
Robert and Michelle?
They've been home ever since they got the news about Paula.
Pleasure to meet you, Detectives.
This is my wife.
Paula No, honey.
That's not Paula.
That's the moose I shot last month.
Doc Gooden just stuffed it for us.
Michelle's obviously taken the news of the drowning pretty hard.
Harder than seven years ago?
The drowning in Santa Barbara?
I'm sensing you played a major role.
Now what's the story, Bob-O?
Michelle, why don't you go put some hot milk on for our guests?
Hmm, hello?
Paula?
See if she'd grabbed the banana, that bit would have killed.
It's not a bit, Shawn.
It was a wrong number.
I probably wouldn't count on that milk.
It's okay.
Do you have something you want to tell us, Mr. Barker?
Twelve years ago, Michelle's sister, Lucy ran away from Dual Spires, taking seven-year-old Paula with her.
We were worried sick about Paula.
See, Lucy was an incredibly unstable person.
Michelle and I practically raised her daughter for her.
Then one day, we got a letter from Paula confirming our worst fears.
It described how magic white rocks were making her mom crazy.
Methamphetamines?
Along with other stuff.
A couple of letters after that was the first mention of the abuse.
And that's when we knew we had to act.
You helped her fake her death?
We had no other choice.
Lucy wouldn't let her go.
And Paula was all for it.
In fact, it was her idea.
It doesn't matter.
What you did was against the law.
If I had jurisdiction here, you'd be under arrest for obstruction of justice.
She was happy here.
And safe.
Until two days ago.
Right.
I'm heading back to Santa Barbara to reopen this case, Mr. Barker.
Once I do, a warrant will be issued for your arrest.
Come on, O'Hara.
Call when you can.
You two understand, right?
We're not here to judge you, Mr. Barker.
We came to investigate, catch bad guys, and eat pie.
Not necessarily in that order.
And it hasn't been.
No.
We started with the pie.
Always.
Do you think we could take a look in Paula's room?
By all means.
We haven't touched a thing.
It's at the top of the stairs on the right.
Dude, the Dr. Ombudsman wasn't kidding.
Sister definitely had a dark side.
Hmm.
What are you doing?
Looking for places she may have hid stuff.
Every teenager has a secret spot, Gus.
Remember when I found those weird photos of John Cusack in your nightstand?
That was Joan.
Really?
Oh, that's much less weird.
Wait.
No, it's not.
Not really.
Incoming.
Dude.
Diary.
Jackpot.
What does it say?
"Math was really hard today".
Blah, blah, blah.
Seems like normal high school stuff to me.
Whoa.
What is this language?
Is this Chinese?
No.
It's Latin, Shawn.
Latin?
Gus, Paula must have thought someone was reading her diary.
We gotta find out what that says.
Yeah, but who do we know that speaks Latin.
"Absens Haeres".
Hairy ass?
"Non erit".
Did you get all that?
Uh-huh.
I believe so.
Haven't you ever heard of faxing, Shawn?
I'm sorry, Father.
We don't have that capability right now.
Besides, I thought that priests thought all technology was evil.
It's only now that it begins to dawn on me how little you learned in my CCD class.
Look, Father, it's very important that we understand what these passages mean.
All right, all right.
Well, this first part talks about a young boy she was seeing.
Someone popular.
Randy.
Yeah, that makes sense.
She refers to him as "R".
Ah, she may have also been seeing someone else.
Excellent, is there a name?
No, just the letter "J".
Letter "J".
All right, thank you Father.
You've been so much help.
Gus will see you at church on Sunday.
Uh-huh, what about you?
What?
Oh, you're breaking up.
What?
What Can't hear anything.
Hello?
Father?
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
There's more.
It really is one square foot of coverage.
Jules, what are you doing here?
Well, Lassiter's handling the reopening of the case back at the department, so I thought I would come back and lend a hand.
Fantastic.
We have to hit the library, follow up on a vision I just had.
All right, well, you two go ahead.
I'm gonna notify Sheriff Jackson that I'm gonna be looking into the case.
What do you say we all meet up at the diner at, uh 4:30?
Labradoodle!
Where?
We should go.
I didn't see any labradoodle, Shawn.
Well, you weren't looking very hard.
Nice shoes.
I know.
Gus was wondering if you would like to be his date to Betty Boop Night at the Road House.
They don't have a Betty Boop Night at the Road House.
Oh, then they don't have my business anymore, either.
Sure you can keep up with me?
I like to dance all night long.
Well Shawn.
What?
Relax.
Okay, here we go.
This is the most recent Dual Spires's yearbook.
Thank you, Maudette.
Feels a little thin.
Small book for a small school.
There were only six people in the graduating class?
Yeah, and even that was large.
Mine only had three.
You, Robert, and Michelle?
You're very impressive, Mr. Spencer.
None of the guys in Paula's class have names that begin with "J".
Let's see here.
Paula sure is in a lot of photos.
Oh, that's not surprising.
She loved the attention.
Huh.
Thank you, Maudette.
Bye, Gus.
Whoa, Jack.
You didn't even give me a chance to see if I had food in my teeth.
They're good.
I'm Shawn.
He's Blackmunn.
Yeah, yeah.
I know who you are.
Oh, good, so you know we're here to ask you some questions about Paula.
You, uh, you ever think about hanging any of your photos on the wall?
Well, to me, each photo is like a memory, so I like to keep them close.
Uh-huh.
How did you get spinach in your teeth within the last three seconds.
I don't know.
You said, I was good.
You were good.
Looks like you and Paula were more than just friends, huh?
Yeah, we were.
Until about a year ago, she left me for the Cinnamon King.
You must have been pretty angry with her.
At first I was, yeah.
But then we became best friends.
I was her confidant.
And we would lip synch to old records together.
Jon Cryer from Pretty in Pink.
No one in this town has ever seen that movie, Shawn.
Well, I refuse to accept that.
Oops!
Jack, that's my bad.
Uh Let me clean this up.
No, no, no, no.
Don't, don't, don't.
The broken glass will make for a beautiful photo.
Yeah, it will.
So what do you think?
You think this guy killed Paula?
Most definitely.
He's a freaky dude living in a freaky place.
And have you noticed he won't ever make eye contact with you?
There's only one reason for that.
Guilt.
Actually, there may be another.
Hey, Jack.
The glass is over here, man.
I know.
Yeah.
I gotta tell you, you are the highest functioning blind person that I've ever seen.
I'm not technically blind.
I still have 30% vision in my right eye for now.
A couple of years ago, I developed early onset macular degeneration.
I'm sensing it was around '05.
Yeah, that's right.
Where were you the night Paula disappeared?
I was with her.
At the beginning of the night.
We took a walk in the forest, and she told me she wanted to leave Dual Spires.
I said that was a mistake.
And then, jet blackness.
What does that mean?
It would be a great porn name for you.
I woke up about an hour later.
With this, a bump on my head.
And there was no Paula.
She knocked you out?
Come on, Jack.
A big guy like you?
No, no, no.
Somebody else snuck up on me, and I wasn't looking.
Well, you could have been looking.
Probably wouldn't have made much of a difference.
He's practically blind.
Why didn't you take any of this to the sheriff, Jack?
Because I may have been the last person to ever see her alive, and my story sounds fishy at best.
I mean, do you believe me?
Were you taking photos that night on the walk?
Yeah, yeah.
Of course I was.
Well, why don't you let us take a look at that film?
Okay.
Ooh.
Why?
Oh, this is good.
This will go well with the five shots of her boots.
Take a blindfolded photo sometime.
Let me know how it turns out.
Wait a second.
Here's something.
Dude, we gotta get to Jules.
Hi, I'm looking for Sheriff Jackson.
The deputy said I could find him here.
Yeah, uh, he just stepped out for a sec.
Do you know when he'll be back?
Oh, any minute now.
You can wait in the back with me.
I'm just doing a little work for shop class.
Okay.
I'm Juliet O'Hara.
Randy.
Randy Jackson.
How much do you weigh?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to ask a woman that question, am I?
Not unless you're piloting a very small plane.
About 105?
Will your dad be here soon?
I imagine so.
Paula weighed about 105.
You kind of remind me of her.
I understand you two were quite close.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Yeah, it's a real tragedy.
You know what?
Why don't I just come back in, like, an hour or so.
No.
Stay.
Hey!
Get your wood out of her face, Randy.
What's going on?
We know you knocked out Jack Smith, when he was with Paula the night she died.
Yeah, I thought he was trying to steal my girlfriend.
Really?
You're jealous of the goofy kid who snaps photos like Jose Feliciano?
Hey, Paula always had a thing for him.
For Jose Feliciano?
No, Jack.
I just gave him a super elbow and he crumbled like feta.
What did Paula do?
She freaked out and went on this rant about how I'm a hypocrite 'cause I spend a lot of time with my ex-girlfriend.
And who's that?
That's none of your business.
What is it with all the secret relationships in this town?
It's like General Hospital.
You're kidding me.
All right, that's it.
Is there a film, or a television series, that you people actually saw?
The town gets together every Thursday night to watch reruns of Everwood.
Okay, I can work with that.
What happened next?
She got mad at me for hurting a blind person.
She then went to find help for Jack.
I offered to go with her, but she wanted nothing to do with me.
So I tied his shoelaces together, and went to the library and waited to hear from her.
Of course, I never did.
Just like Treat Williams' character on Everwood.
Never got to say good-bye to his wife.
Shawn.
Look, I'm telling you guys the truth.
Plus, I have an alibi, remember?
All right.
But we're on to you, Randy.
Just like the townspeople of Everwood were on to the fact that Nina was a surrogate mother.
Will you stop it?
Enough.
She was.
Thank you.
So, who do we think Randy's ex is?
Mmm, Jules, you gotta order a piece of this pie.
I did.
You guys immediately ate it.
Well, it's gotta be someone who's into the creepsters, but I'm guessing she's older, 'cause I'm yet to see a woman under the age of 35 in this town.
It's also someone that Randy spends consistent time with.
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.
I'm getting something.
I'm at the library almost every night.
Randy and I have a very special bond, you see.
Four slices to go, please.
If Maudette was sleeping with Randy, that's gross.
She practically raised him.
The only thing that would make it grosser is if she wasn't attractive.
What's wrong with you?
This goes beyond Maudette getting her Pamela Smart on.
I think she killed Paula.
What?
How do you figure?
I'm sensing that Randy went to the library that night to finally tell Maudette that he and Paula were leaving Dual Spires.
Sent her into a jealous rage.
She snuck out, killed Paula, because if she couldn't have Randy, no woman would.
That changes everything.
Remind me to never have an affair with an older woman or a librarian.
Maudette.
That's not good.
Oh.
I am so sick of this town.
Go ahead and wheel her around the corner to my office.
I can't believe Maudette Hornsby was taking advantage of my son.
Taking advantage is a little strong.
The dude was 17 and she was fine.
What exactly constitutes the difference between altar boy Gus and degenerate Gus?
Reputation was everything to Maudette.
The prospect of the town knowing about that scandal was probably more than she could live with.
I better speak to my boy.
And I'll get on that autopsy.
The fact that she murdered someone may have also hurt her reputation.
All right, I'm gonna get back and brief the department.
Do you want me to drive you to your car?
No.
Yes.
We'll meet you back there in a bit.
Okay.
Why are we not getting the hell out of here?
Because my theory is half-baked, Gus.
Something isn't sitting right with me.
You know what's not sitting right with me, Shawn?
Being stuck in a tiny town with no phone access and all white people.
Let's go.
Now where are you going?
If we leave now, I'll let you play the theme to Weird Science over and over in the car.
What do you say?
That's happening regardless.
This way.
Here is the most recent Dual Spires yearbook.
Maudette was the one emailing us.
That makes no sense.
Why would the killer lure detectives to the scene and then start feeding them clues?
Because she didn't kill Paula, Gus.
I'm never gonna leave this town.
She suspected foul play and knew she'd be the prime suspect if anyone found out about her relationship with Randy.
So she started snooping around on her own, discovered the drowning seven years ago in Santa Barbara.
Found us on the Internet.
So who killed Paula Merral?
I don't know, but we're gonna find out.
Gus, stop messing around.
I'm not, Shawn.
Shawn?
Yes, Gus.
Something's burning.
I see that.
Help us!
Somebody help us.
We're stuck in this tiny room!
Help us!
Let us out!
Do something!
I'm trying!
I'm all ears!
Email Lassiter, your dad or Juliet!
Oh, that's good.
Where were these dope ideas three minutes ago?
I knew it!
Surge protectors serve no purpose whatsoever!
Shawn, we're gonna die in this tiny, stupid room.
Gus, don't be the scream from Holding Back the Years.
You're right, though.
This could be it for us.
Man, we are gonna burn!
I know.
No, wait, wait!
Who are you?
Gus!
Father Westley.
Thank God you were here, literally.
We were about to be Wicker Men, How did you find us?
I just had faith.
Really?
No, boys.
I just got to town, I saw the fire, I saw the tandem bicycle outside.
It all added up.
But how did you know we were in trouble in the first place?
You hung up on me when I was transcribing the Latin, Shawn.
I just I got excited.
I took one little step to the left.
And that girl, Paula.
She felt she was in danger.
She was afraid.
Which led me to be afraid for the two of you.
And, honestly, I owed you one anyway because of that whole exorcism thing.
What happened to your hair?
Oh.
Yeah, it was an ill-advised attempt to cover up some gray that went terribly awry.
But technically, Sister Rita's to blame.
She's the one that did my hair.
Guys, get in.
We don't have much time.
You have a car?
What gives?
Why should we trust you?
You probably shouldn't, but if you stay here you're gonna be sitting ducks for whoever it was that tried to burn you guys alive.
I'll explain everything at the cabin.
Get in.
Have a seat, I'll make a fire.
All right, we're listening.
My great grandfather founded Dual Spires.
That's him there.
I might have guessed that one.
After World War I ended, he'd seen the absolute worst in man.
He decided to settle here with two other soldiers from his squadron and their families.
I was wrong, it isn't Witness.
This is The Village.
The Village was a ridiculous film.
"Those we do not speak of".
Remember all that nonsense?
It's always been the responsibility of the three leaders of the families to watch over the town and its best interests.
Try to understand, their intentions were so pure.
Create a community that wouldn't be subjected to the horrors that they lived through.
And it worked for 40 years.
Dual Spires was perfect, until The great sawmill fire of '58.
It was arson.
A drifter, who had been in town doing odd jobs.
Eight people burned to death.
After that, we became insulated.
Looked at all outsiders as a threat.
Like Paula.
She was afraid.
She thought she was being watched.
Even followed.
She was.
Which is why Michelle and I were supportive of her decision to leave.
I We loved her so much.
We just wanted her to be happy.
Did Paula ever know that you were her father?
Yes.
I had to tell her, in order to get her to come here in the first place.
What about your wife?
Did she know you had an affair with her sister?
No.
She never will.
I think she's been through enough.
You know, for a town that prides itself on honesty and do-goodedness, you have a lot of skeletons in your closet.
Judge not, that ye may be judged, Gus.
Although, I must say, in this case, it's pretty messed up.
I know who killed Paula Merral.
Sheriff, you can put the gun down.
This is Father Westley.
He saved us.
My hair doesn't normally look like this.
Bless me father, for I have sinned.
But I'm afraid I can't put away this gun.
No, I suppose you can't.
You see, the other two families that settled this town were the Jacksons and the Goodens, am I right?
And as its other two leaders, you panicked when you caught wind that the evil Paula was running away with Randy.
I mean, without the Cinnamon King, who would lead over future generations?
The good doctor can't conceive.
The Barkers didn't have a child of their own, which means Randy is the only direct descendent to protect Dual Spires and your way of life.
Especially now that the sheriff is dying of cancer.
I know he's hurting, but he won't talk to me.
The two of you wielded all the power necessary to kill Paula and make it look like an accident.
And you would have gotten away with it too, if Maudette hadn't sent those emails.
But even that was nothing a little rope couldn't take care of.
Isn't that right, sheriff?
You truly are amazing.
But you shouldn't have come here.
Our business was not your concern.
Your business is murder.
Her death, though tragic, saves our future.
You killed my little girl.
What about us?
Honestly, far less tragic.
We barely know you.
I'm in my own special category.
Right?
Really, father?
Freeze!
Drop it, now.
How did you find us?
Oh, miracles happen every day, Gus.
This is a miracle?
No, I called the detectives before I came to town.
You sly old dog.
We ran into Jack, and he led us here.
They thought this place was a secret.
I've photographed every single inch of this town.
Ah, good work, son.
We're over here.
Oh, Jack.
Yo!
SHAWN Now, Jack, really It's brighter than the sun.
Enough.
Enough.
It's nice to finally have some alone time.
It is.
Though, you know, we're not really alone, Shawn.
You were not lying about the pie, Burton.
It's heavenly.
Right?
Now on to Ecclesiastes.
It's one of my favorites.
Hmm?
Couldn't blow off a priest, I'm pretty sure that's a sin.
It's not so much Gus, and Father Westley, and Carlton.
That is a damn fine cup of cider.
It's the other people.
Three cinnamon pies, please.
What do you say we get out of here?
I'm in.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Come on, Nino.
Show us the goods.
Listen up, the minute Nino reveals his stash, we move.
Who is it?
Somebody's at the door.
Room service.
Good afternoon.
I have your lunch, Mr. Baez.
You gotta be kidding me.
Get the hell out of here.
This couldn't get any more ridiculous.
It's not my fault.
It's Don's.
I was wrong.
Oh, jeez.
Oh, no.
I'm just doing my job, sir.
Get the hell out of here.
A- ha.
What the hell is going on?
We should get in there.
Eh, just hold on there.
Keep going.
We were not under the impression that you would be armed.
Are you selling these prescription drugs right out of this hotel room?
Yeah, sure.
Did you get that?
Got it, sir.
Let's move.
I'm busy wiping up Crap.
Don't move!
Don't you fricking move!
SBPD!
Lassie.
We totally caught the bad guys.
What were you thinking, crashing a stakeout?
You're welcome.
You think the Chief called us in to congratulate us on our bust yesterday?
Most definitely.
I'm also assuming that there will be an award involved.
A "Busty"?
I was thinking lifetime achievement.
Busties usually go to strippers or sculptors.
Lionel Richie has one.
Oh.
All right, everybody, listen up, this morning another check-cashing establishment was robbed at gunpoint.
It, like the others, is owned by DeVry Longsdale.
Longsdale is a two-bit gangster who runs one of the sleaziest operations in town.
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if he's being ripped off by some other lowlife that he's double-crossed.
It is important that we separate our feelings about Longsdale from the fact that whoever's robbing him is breaking the law and needs to be brought to justice.
And we have strong reason to believe, based on security-video footage, that this person is a Mr. David Arnold.
He is 35 years of age and served seven years for armed robbery.
He disables the alarm, gets in and out in under five minutes.
He is all business.
But only up front.
Around back, there is a major party going on.
Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster, my office now.
Excuse us.
Gus and I have to go receive props now.
Chief.
Commander.
Mr. Spencer.
Yesterday's stunt may be the most asinine and idiotic thing I've seen in all my years at this department.
That doesn't sound like props.
She's roasting us.
Oh.
What the hell do you think you were doing?
Oh, I don't know, catching the bad guys?
I hired you to assist Lassiter in taking down Baez, not go rogue.
Yeah.
I told him over a week ago that I sensed Baez was working out of that hotel, and he didn't do anything.
He was setting up a sting, Shawn.
Do you have any idea what that involves?
Newman, Redford, the ladies, the ponies.
Wiretaps, search warrants, surveillance teams, all of which take time.
That sounds like something for you to worry about.
What we like to do is come up with a solution and make it happen.
Not always in that order.
Well, I can't afford to hire you on any more cases when you have zero understanding of basic police procedure.
In the end, we always come through.
Just like the chairman of the federal reserve.
I'm not putting you on another case until you acquire a fundamental understanding of the way police operate.
Fine.
We'll dust off our Chips DVDs and meet you back here Monday morning.
Best homework ever.
I'm afraid that's not going to cut it.
Henry.
We've organized for both of you to participate in a three-week crash course at the Police Academy.
What?
Boing.
I have to warn you, this is going to be challenging.
Come on, son.
Don't worry.
We know exactly what we need to do.
We make funny sound effects with our mouths, stay on Bubba Smith's good side.
Gus, give me some machine-gun action.
I said machine gun.
I know.
That was an AK-47.
No, I was talking about the firearm.
This isn't a movie, Shawn.
You're gonna have to exhibit discipline, a respect for authority, a willingness to follow the rules, none of which are your strong suit.
You just tell me when and where.
This is a Rebecca Lobo layup.
Okay.
You have to report to the academy downtown at noon.
Noon?
That means we have four hours.
Four hours?
No.
It's 11:00 a.m. I know.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know So Chief Vick told me you two were psychics.
That's just me, sir.
I'm a pharmaceutical salesman, sir.
You don't need to finish every sentence with the word "sir".
But it feels fun and silly, sir.
Well, knock it off.
What the hell are you two wearing, anyway?
These are official Police Academy sweat outfits.
I've never seen 'em before.
Then you've never seen any of the movies.
These are exact replicas.
If you give Gus your sizes, he'll make you one as well.
Let me make one thing very clear, gentlemen.
This is not summer camp.
For the next three weeks, I will be putting you through an intense program designed to make you think, act, and behave like officers of the law.
Prepare to be pushed to your physical, mental, and, yes, emotional limits.
Warning, Gus here's a big weeper.
Says the guy who broke down while watching a commercial this morning.
There were abused puppies and a Sarah McLachlan song.
I am not a robot.
Good.
Wanted to make sure you two didn't snake out of this.
Nick Conforth?
I didn't know you were still on the force.
Hello, Lassiter.
How do you two know each other?
Us?
We're old pals from the academy.
We had an ongoing battle as to who would graduate in the top spot.
I won.
That's probably 'cause you cheated on that final exam.
I earned that spot fair and square.
It's good to see you two have put all this old stuff behind you.
Look, none of that matters now, does it?
Because I'm head detective of the SBPD, and you're You're clearly doing well.
I'm the associate head of this academy, in charge of all cadet training.
Cool.
Hey, look at that.
They even give you your own badge.
It just turns out my heart was in teaching.
Look, there is no judgment here.
If you ever want a real-life example of someone who catches bad guys for a living, I'd be more than happy to come talk to your students.
Don't you forget that I worked in the field, too, Detective.
That's right.
What was that, six months?
Six months you did that.
Then what happened?
'Cause I don't I don't remember, Conforth.
Units in the vicinity of 2435 Liblock Avenue, two suspects are in a Excuse me.
Duty calls.
Copy, Lassiter responding.
ETA, 15 minutes.
I got to go.
Really good seeing you, Conforth.
Have fun with these clowns.
Is he really head detective?
I'm afraid so.
Officer Conforth, is it possible that I may take a little snack break?
I haven't had anything since 2:00.
It's 2:15.
Absolutely not.
Is that a fire alarm?
I don't hear anything.
Why is he making weird cat noises?
You have to stop.
You're embarrassing yourself.
Listen, your program breaks down as follows.
A third will be spent in the classroom.
A third will involve fieldwork.
And one-third will be focused on physical training.
What about the other third?
Are you kidding?
Never mind.
Surprise us.
Dude, you're supposed to let go.
And fall into that disgusting-ass water?
I'll get dysentery, Shawn.
How did this improve the situation?
What is dysentery?
Time!
I can't believe you are Henry Spencer's son.
Well, neither can I. It's an ongoing investigation, and in my defense, I had reasonable suspicion for all of those cardboard people that I shot.
You shot two innocent women.
If I may, the first woman with the groceries was exiting a library that doesn't allow snacks.
I know this because we've tried on several occasions.
And the second woman was simply a replica of the first woman, but they painted her face brown, which is both offensive and suspicious.
But you shot her three times.
Semantics.
It's not semantics.
How can you two be responsible for solving all these cases?
I can't believe you get out of bed in the morning without hurting yourselves.
Oh, but we do, and injury-free since June of last year, when Gus broke his finger flipping the injury-countdown calendar.
Wait, that's irony, right?
Irony is you asking me what irony means every time you say it.
All right, maybe you'll do better in the field.
Today we will be patrolling a designated area under the close supervision of myself and Fenway.
Who's Fenway?
That guy right over there.
Best scent dog in the state.
Played a role in solving over 50 cases.
Also played roles in The Bad News Bears, The 0dd Couple, and Grumpy 0ld Men.
He does look like Walter Matthau.
Here are your uniforms.
The badges are temporary.
The guns, thank God, are props, but everything else is what's issued to our current officers.
These are not toys, gentlemen!
An officer's equipment is to be guarded and accounted for at all times.
Is that clear?
Yes, sensei.
So, on patrol today, can we pull people over and stuff?
Yes, as long as there's probable cause.
You've got to be kidding me.
Sir, I'm gonna need to see your license and registration, please.
Spencer, you must be out of your damn mind if you think that's gonna happen.
License and registration, please, sir.
Hey!
Have you been drinking, sir?
That's it.
Sir, if you don't calm down, I will be forced to tase you in the face.
You don't have a taser.
Oh.
I should have known.
You were doing 45 in a 40.
The law is the law.
What the hell, Conforth?
You can't beat me on the field, so now you're trying to beat me off?
You may want to rephrase that, sir.
Maybe he has been drinking.
Sir, I'm gonna need you to stand on one foot and hop at a medium pace.
All units, we have a robbery in progress at Longsdale's check cashing , Wilcox and Shire.
You three clowns stay here.
I'm gonna go do some real police work.
You're pathetic, Conforth.
Damn.
Don't let him get to you, Nick.
No, he's right.
I am pathetic.
What the hell am I doing?
I'll tell you exactly what you're doing.
You're teaching refined skills that guys like us can utilize for weeks, most likely days.
Seriously, for the ten hours or so that we retain the stuff that you've taught us, you made a real difference, Nick.
I am twice the cop that he is.
Well, don't just stand there and wax on about it.
Did you notice that he took the freeway?
So?
So?
He just added 10 minutes to his trip.
We can get you there in under five.
Just in time to bust the perp.
No.
No.
No way.
You know what kind of trouble I'd get into getting two cadets involved in an active robbery?
No.
Think about it, Nick.
This is finally a chance to show him up once and for all.
If we do this, we got to catch the bad guys.
Don't worry, Nick.
It's our specialty.
Slow down.
It's just up here on the left.
Holy crap.
That's the guy.
Stop the car.
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop right here.
Let's go, Nick.
Nick!
Nick.
I understand why he went back to teaching.
He's headed towards the college over there.
I guess that obstacle course does have a practical purpose.
Everybody, listen up!
Come out of your dorm rooms!
We are looking for a redneck Hello.
With a black backpack, and we're pretty sure he came down this hallway.
Screw you, cadet.
Uh, he went right out there.
Guster, any luck?
That's a negative.
What are you guys, like, firemen?
Don't sweat it, Nick.
And Lassie doesn't need to hear about this.
Too late, idiots.
Where's Mr. Guster?
Well, Chief, I'm gonna be frank with you.
Gus had a tuna Possibly chicken-salad sandwich from the vending machine, and that, combined with the fact that we're in hot water again, put his stomach on the fritz.
How long will he be?
Thirty-five, Well, you can fill him in yourself.
Officer Conforth, you drove two cadets to a robbery in progress, and you let them chase a suspect while you did what exactly?
I'm not sure it's important, Chief.
I have an educated guess that's 100% accurate.
Officer Conforth here froze like the North Pole, because when some men look danger in the eye, they blink repeatedly, like they're staring into the sun.
Some things never change, huh?
Well, unfortunately, I have no choice but to suspend you for one month, pending a full investigation.
No.
Come on, Chief, don't you think that's a little harsh?
Mr. Spencer, you're in no position to be defending anyone.
You were told not to participate in any investigations until you completed your training, and then you ignored me while somehow managing to lose half your equipment in the process.
What?
I lost my hat and my flashlight.
Where's your radio?
Boom.
And my radio I lost that.
Look, a guy can only carry so much stuff, Chief.
You and Mr. Guster are to return to the academy immediately.
We'd love to do that for you, Chief, but you just suspended our instructor.
And I'm not entirely sure Gus is gonna make it out of the latrine.
Well, you now have a substitute, one that I have handpicked to ensure that there will be no more incidents.
This maneuver is called the Precision Immobilization Technique, or the PIT method.
It is when one car pursuing another forces the pursued vehicle to abruptly halt.
You may want to write this down.
Dude, this is so Top Gun.
Hmm.
I'm Cruise.
She's McGillis.
You're Sundown.
Why can't I be the Goose?
You know why.
Stop hypothetically typecasting me, Shawn.
Come on, it means you were also in Die Hard and all those episodes of Walker, Texas Ranger.
I want to be the black Goose.
I can't do this with your right now.
Fine.
Yes, Mr. Spencer.
Have you ever seen a small, blue vehicle swing out in front of a twin mack truck, pull a 180 spin, and then continue in reverse while maintaining both speed and control?
No.
And why would someone do something so stupid?
To communicate.
You know, to keep up international relations.
Do you have any real questions, or would you rather keep wasting our time?
Well, hypothetically speaking, let's say there's a guy knocking off check-cashing places in order to gather That's not hypothetical.
That is a real and current case we are not discussing in this class.
Understood.
Yes, Mr. Spencer.
Let's say there's a lady, and she has sticky fingers, and she's knocking off those joints that give you, like, a cash advance on your paycheck in case you want to go to a club.
Okay, you know what?
That's gonna be it for today.
We will continue discussing the PIT maneuver on Friday.
Mr. Spencer, a word?
I think you might be in trouble with the teacher.
I sure hope so.
You should start taking this training seriously.
It's for your own good.
Oh, come on, we both know this is some crazy idea dreamt up by my dad and the Chief.
It wasn't their idea, Shawn.
It was mine.
I suggested the academy to protect you from being killed.
Hey, Carlton.
David Arnold's car was just spotted near Rose Valley on Harris Street.
This is the real deal, O'Hara.
Hop in a black-and-white, and let's bust this guy.
I'm on my way.
I got to go.
Jules Look, I know that Gus and I are not supposed to get involved in this investigation, but I have to be honest with you.
That's gonna be very difficult for us.
Yeah, I can see that.
Why don't you come with me?
Really?
Yeah.
Sundown, we're in.
The Goose, Shawn, the black Goose.
That has no ring to it at all.
Harris Street at Rose Valley, unit 21 en route.
Suspect named in check-cashing robberies detained, awaiting backup.
License plate confirmed.
Registrant, David Arnold.
Approach with extreme caution.
What?
Wow.
She locked us in the car.
That's why she let us come, so she could keep tabs.
That crafty little doodle pumpkin.
Get out of that vehicle with your hands in the air.
Do it!
You locked 'em in the cruiser, right?
Yes.
No problem.
I appreciate that.
We are gonna be in so much hot water for this, Shawn.
Come on, Gus.
The water is lukewarm, pee-warm at worst.
Bottom line is, this is not sitting right with me.
You say that for every case.
Yeah, but this is like sitting on a chair covered with little wooden jacks that dig right up into the hunkers.
Why would you choose that?
Look, we owe it to Nick to catch this clown.
It's your fault he got suspended.
It's our fault.
How come when something is my fault, it's mine exclusively, but when it's your fault, we share it equally?
Because I went to college.
That's not cool.
Well This is weird.
What?
The license plate registered to David Arnold's car has been in the system for over a year.
So?
So that tiny Korean woman bought her car three weeks ago.
Which means prior to three weeks ago, the police were tracking a license plate number that hadn't even been created yet.
Exactly.
The question is, how did a bogus license plate number make it onto David Arnold's profile?
Who are you calling?
His parole officer.
Dude, it's an IKEA.
Uh, question, do you guys make those Swedish meatballs in house, or do you have them flown in frozen?
Gus, what if they're frozen?
That's a huge game changer for us.
We'll call them back later, Shawn.
I think all the information in David Arnold's police record is phony.
What about his listed home address?
It's in Boise, Idaho.
The Wild Goose Lounge?
As in wild-goose chase.
David Arnold doesn't exist, Gus.
Somebody made him up, like Kelly LeBrock in Weird Science, minus that sweet, generous bosom and the seductive accent.
So this fake guy's a red herring for the police to chase, while the real robbers are ripping off these check-cashing places.
Who is capable of hacking into the SBPD database and planting a fake profile?
He's headed towards the college over there.
He went out there.
What are you guys, like, firemen?
Those crafty little bastards.
We got to go back to college.
Maverick to Charlie, over.
What, Shawn?
According to the dean of SBIT, the kids are Chris Shepard and Dickie Hollenbrau.
Apparently, they're both computer wunderkinds.
And you think they're the ones that hacked into the SBPD database?
That's a 10-4, Charlie.
They disabled Longsdale's security system minutes before the hit.
Okay, listen, do not go any further with this, and by all means, do not go tracking them down at that school.
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!
Copy that.
You are unbelievable.
Look, backup is on the way.
Just don't do what you normally do.
Done.
Let's do this.
I go high.
You go low.
I'll go high.
You go low.
I always go high.
We only did high-Iow once.
Yeah, and I went high.
Let's mix it up.
Go low.
Ah!
Ow!
Looks like they cleared out of here.
Yeah, I can see that, Gus.
You went high.
I know.
Dude What are you doing?
We have, like, six minutes before Lassie gets here.
We will be Long Duk gone by then, Gus.
Just snoop it up.
Hey, you think it's weird that these two have over 10,000 loyal-shopper points from Bazo's Grocery, even though it's, like, Yeah, and the tuna salad is really mayonnaise-y.
Check this out.
What do you got?
Ooh.
Mmm-hmm.
This is their room right here.
Closet.
Gus.
The smoking gun.
Oh, we just missed these puppies.
Two-bit gangster DeVry Longsdale.
That's DeVry.
He owns the check-cashing places that got knocked off.
We gonna find these guys, get my money, and shoot 'em in they faces like Marvin in Pulp Fiction.
Except we gonna do it on purpose.
How did these two idiots figure out that it was Chris and Dickie who were robbing 'em?
I don't know, Gus, but we better find those kids before DeVry does.
Look, I know you guys searched their dorm because it reeked of popcorn.
That's all you're going off of?
Plus, you left this.
Ooh.
You have a problem.
And one other thing, I have arranged for someone else to take you on your ride-along today.
What?
Jules, you can't bail on us now.
Yeah, we're this close to catching Chris and Dickie.
I just don't want to get implicated in any of this.
Well, that is disappointing.
Okay, fine, then who'd you get to replace you?
You guys ready to go?
You rock my world.
After you, Buzz.
What?
So I thought we'd, uh, cruise across town and, uh, follow up on some reported vandalism.
Sweet.
Sounds good, Buzz.
You mind if we stop off at Bazo's Grocery first?
Uh, no.
No can do.
I was given strict orders not to stop for anything else but an emergency.
All right, but, uh, if Gus here doesn't get some sugar into his system ASAP, his foot's gonna fall off.
See, he's got diabetes, type "A" and simplex 2.
Aw, jeez.
My grandmother had that.
Are you sure it can't wait till later?
Oh, no, it's fine.
It's fine.
As long as you don't mind having my foot pop off in your backseat.
No way, not on my watch.
Hang tight, boys.
Thanks, Buzz.
It's like taking candy from an enormous baby.
What?
I'll stay with the car.
Get me a couple of glazed.
Well, it looks like the grocery business has been good to Mr. Bazo.
I don't know if it's these uniforms, but I've never craved doughnuts more.
We're gonna need another basket.
I hear that.
They have muffins and croissants on this bottom shelf here.
Oh, yeah.
Where are you going?
That's where all the money's coming from.
Bazo's a bookie.
And a heavily armed one.
May I help you?
It's certainly possible.
I'm Officer Shawn Spencer, and this is my partner, Mission Figs.
We're here to ask the tough questions.
For starters, who are you?
Lester Bazo, and that wasn't very tough.
I like to ease my way in.
What's the capital of Liechtenstein?
Shawn.
We're looking for Chris Shepard and Dickie Hollenbrau.
I believe they frequented this establishment.
Do I look like their mothers?
Hard to know.
We haven't seen photos.
I don't have to answer any of your questions, seeing as you're just cadets.
Guilty as charged.
Besides, we're not here to bust you, man.
Figs and I have no problems with gambling.
Matter of fact, we've been known to lay down a few wagers ourselves.
The racing hot dogs on the jumbotrons at ball games.
Always bet on relish.
The truth is, Chris and Dickie are friends of ours.
Well, I'm tight with Chris, and Figs loves Dickie.
What?
We're worried they might have gambling problems.
You think?
They were into me for $250k.
What do you mean they were?
Those pinheads paid me off in full last night.
I don't know where they came up with the money, nor do I care.
Fantastic.
One last question Is this the only doughnut station in the store?
Get the hell out of here.
So Chris and Dickie get in over their heads with this goon, so they knock off DeVry, grab the cash they need to pay him back.
Which may be the dumbest plan two geniuses ever came up with.
Oh, hey, bummer, guys.
We got to cut the ride-along short.
Lassiter called while you guys were in Bazo's, and they got a reported sighting of the check-cashing suspects in, uh, Mission Canyon.
So, I got to go patrol the area without you guys.
I'll drop you off at the station so you can get your car.
Thanks, Buzz.
No problem.
Mission Canyon, that's a pretty small area, isn't it?
Yeah, it's three square miles at most.
Why?
I think I know how we can track 'em down.
Nick!
Yo, Nick!
Up and at 'em, man.
Duty calls.
Nick!
Go away.
Dude, I was kidding.
What, did you sleep here last night?
Maybe.
Look, we can catch the guys responsible for those robberies.
Good.
You guys go.
I'll just screw it up.
I cannot believe what I am hearing.
Do you know what the Nick Conforth we know would be doing right now?
No.
Well, neither do we, really, because our whole relationship with you only spans about a day.
But, come on, don't you teach your cadets to To tough it out when the chips are down?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Then you need to practice what you preach.
Now, you get dressed and help us bust these guys.
What do you have to lose?
Nothing.
You're right.
I literally have nothing left.
That's the spirit.
All right, what do you need me to do?
Grab Walter Matthau.
Fenway.
There he is.
Matthau.
Matthau's coming.
A little fieldwork is exactly what Fenway needed to help get his self-esteem back.
Worst idea ever.
Hold on, hold on.
He's on to something.
The suspect may be in that house.
Or there's a squirrel.
Yes!
Best idea ever.
Let's do this.
Hold on.
Hold on.
We got to call for backup first.
Really?
We're off-duty, and you've been suspended.
I don't care.
We're doing this the right way, end of story.
So call it in, or I will.
I need somebody's thing.
What?
Looking at me like that is not gonna make my walkie come back, Gus.
This is car number B- lue-berry.
We have suspects Shepard and Hollenbrau in our sights.
requesting backup.
Roger, over, rinse, repeat.
Spencer, I know that's you.
Stay where you are.
I'm 20 minutes out.
Where's the money?
I'll get your money!
Ow!
That's what you get for following orders.
Stay back.
Ah, Dickie, what happened?
Some guy that looks like a fabulous Emmitt Smith just kidnapped my friend.
DeVry.
He says he's gonna kill Chris in 24 hours if we don't give him back the $250,000 that we stole from him.
Seriously, how does DeVry keep showing up at places moments after we do?
Uh-oh.
I think I know who has my walkie.
You told DeVry where we were?
Inadvertently, okay?
He has my walkie.
Because you left it at DeVry's check-cashing place.
Gus, it is difficult to hoof it around with a belt that's got all this business on it.
What did I tell you about keeping your police possessions close to you?
Nick, you're gonna blow a top, man.
What have I lost, honestly?
A measly radio and those big, pink cuffs that look like trash ties.
Dickie, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, okay?
I really am, but I cannot get taken in right now.
They will kill Chris.
He's my best friend.
I got to go save him.
Don't follow me.
Dickie!
Nice, Shawn.
Okay, this is not great for us.
Wow.
I am speechless.
Me, too, Chief.
You know, Nick, I have no idea what's going on inside that head of yours, but I've got no choice but to extend your suspension for another month.
Ohh.
And you Okay, where is Mr. Guster?
Uh, Chief, I'm afraid that what we, uh, may be dealing with is an IBS situation.
Don't know if you've seen the commercials I've seen the commercials.
Well, then you know it can be spotty.
Oh, God, please, just stop talking.
I have received a lot of advice on how to discipline you guys, ranging from your father's suggestion that we merely extend your police training to having you pick up garbage on the beach wearing orange jumpsuits.
That was mine.
I prefer my dad's idea.
Well, I don't.
Enrolling you guys in the academy was a good idea gone horribly, horribly awry.
At least when you screwed up as detectives, you'd somehow end up catching the bad guys.
Some people just aren't cut out for police work.
With that said, Mr. Spencer, you and Mr. Guster are hereby reinstated as consultants, effective immediately.
Sorry?
That is a clever, well-timed quip, Chief.
It's not a quip, Detective.
You can't be serious.
Yeah, they did screw up again, but they were able to track down our suspects before we did.
We're a team.
And I'd prefer that they screw up while not wearing our uniforms.
We won't let you down, Chief.
Yes, you will.
Now hand over your cadet badge.
Gladly.
Must've slung it in one of these side babies here, just right in here, for safe I really do have a problem.
It's over.
You were in the Johnny can the whole time?
My belt is still intact, Shawn.
It doesn't just slide on and off.
Here's the good news.
We don't have to wear this ridiculous gear anymore.
We are back.
I think I'm gonna go hit a bar and another bar and then another.
Nick, come on, man, you got to rally it up.
Dickie's out there somewhere trying to wrangle the money to pay DeVry back.
We just got to find him.
No, I'll pass.
Besides, where in the world is he gonna come up with 250 grand within the next six hours?
I have a guess.
Do you honestly think that Dickie would be so dumb as to rob from the crazy bookie he just paid off?
The kid's desperate, Gus.
Nobody steals from Lester Bazo.
Yes, I think he's that dumb.
That's propane, Shawn.
We got to get in there and save Dickie.
That's not what I was thinking.
Come on.
I'm out.
Hey, Dickie, what's the word?
Damn, you almost got this off.
What are you guys doing here?
I simply can't imagine us getting ourselves into a worse situation.
Yo, Dickie!
Where you at, man?
I know you in here.
Who the hell are you?
Who am I?
I'm that cat you be seeing in your dreams and your nightmares.
DeVry, I got your money.
Shh.
All right.
That money belongs to me.
Really?
I don't think so.
You do realize this is the end of True Romance.
That was a massacre, Shawn.
Everybody died.
That's not true.
Christian Slater and Patty Arquette made it out.
And Michael Rapaport.
That's a good point, Dickie.
I forgot about that.
I know you ain't got no shells in that gun.
We are gonna die and die ugly, Shawn.
They're gonna take us out.
Not if they take each other out first.
Attention, shoppers.
Attention, shoppers.
All tubed meats are half off today, and for you Bloodsport fans out there, Bolo Yeung is in aisle seven looking to get shot.
over in produce, we have Jackie Earle Haley on steroids toting a gun.
Squash that melon.
Dude, dude, it's working.
All that's left is Bazo and DeVry.
I just done shot Bazo three times.
Now I'm coming for you, Dickie.
What the hell are we gonna do, Shawn?
You know what?
It's time for a trained officer of the law to step up and save the day.
We have been at the academy for two days.
Two days, Shawn.
Cover me.
With what?
Improvise.
That's That's my gun.
Dude, what was that?
It was me!
Are you kidding me?
You've achieved pitch-perfect AK-47 mouth action.
I know!
I've been practicing!
Air bump.
You know Devry's right behind you, right?
That's right.
Turn around.
Things you need to do for me, or you die.
One, drop your weapon.
Two, get that Dickie out here with my money.
And three, tell me where the heck you got them Kicks, 'cause I'm feeling them in a nasty, silly way.
These?
Mmm-hmm.
You like these, huh?
Mmm.
But seriously, though, kick that gun over here.
I'm gonna kill you anyway, I think, so Not on my watch.
Hey!
Nick, I didn't know you shopped here.
I don't.
Too much mayonnaise in the tuna salad.
I still got a hostage, fool, which means I still have the upper hand.
And speaking of hands, yours is shaking like crazy.
Nick!
You are under arrest.
Nick, you're amazing.
You're a crack shot.
Mr. Spencer, do you have this under control?
I believe I do.
How you doing over there?
I think I'm gonna barf.
Oh, that's That's unfortunate.
Well, this case has had a lot of ups and downs, but you pulled it together in the end.
And on a separate note, Mr. Spencer and Mr. Guster, you will return the 11 bags of groceries that you procured while the crime scene at Bazo's was being processed.
Well, Chief, we planned on paying for those groceries, but, unfortunately, Mr. Bazo is dead.
He isn't dead.
He's in the ICU.
Oh.
Did you already put that giant ham in the oven?
You know I did.
Officer Conforth, in the end, you showed great bravery.
But you may very well be the worst officer in the field I've ever seen.
Detective Lassiter, go ahead.
The cadets coming out of your classes at the academy are top-notch, Conforth.
I respect that, not very much, but enough to make it worth mentioning.
That being said, we are withdrawing your suspension.
You can start back at the academy tomorrow.
Thank you, Detective.
And I'm glad that the cadets have a great role model such as yourself to look up to when they're out in the field, so Fellas, I think we can probably afford to nip the love fest in the butt.
What do you say?
Yeah.
I think it's "bud," Shawn.
Well, I think "butt" makes more sense.
You know what, Nick?
You can be my wingman anytime.
Our wingman.
Wingman?
What, like, a helper on dates?
Nope.
That's a negative.
Good luck to you, bud.
Come on.
Psst.
Chief's gonna make you return the groceries, isn't she?
Yeah.
Well, I got something way cooler than 23 boxes of Cap'n Crunch, a honey-baked ham, and soy milk.
Soy milk?
Damn it, Gus.
Oh, my gooshin.
That is an exact replica of Kelly McGillis' leather jacket from Top Gun.
I can wear it tonight.
How about I wear it tonight?
That's weird.
Yeah.
You wear it tonight.
I'll wear it.
Sorry.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
KSRP 23 has obtained the video footage in question that led to the mistrial.
Thanks for that report, Katie.
The person seen in the video conducting the unauthorized search is one Shawn Spencer, a psychic consultant for the Santa Barbara Police Department.
Hey, have I always had that duck tail?
Your meeting with the Chief starts in 30 minutes.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to perfect a move called the pull shot, which should never be confused with the snake.
Cut the crap, Shawn.
I told you not to go into that building without the police.
But you never listen to me.
Ever.
Now they look like amateurs and Psych might be finished!
Gus, don't be the way Eriq La Salle spells "Eriq".
You know I would never go snooping around willy-nilly.
Of course I checked for security cameras.
They must have been hidden.
Damn it, Karen!
Czarsky's going to walk.
How could you let this happen?
We've been building a case against Czarsky for months.
I realize that, District Attorney Clark, but remember it was my detectives who got you the evidence you needed to prosecute Czarsky for tax fraud in the first place.
This guy is the kind of pond scum that intimidates good, hardworking people to not testify.
If I weren't a cop, I would shoot him in a dark alley and leave evidence suggesting his own people were behind it.
And when I say "I," I mean a fake, imaginary detective to be played by Powers Boothe.
Well, none of that matters now because your evidence was obtained by trespassing on Czarsky's property.
It's fruit from a poisonous tree, and as a result, Judge Leland has declared a mistrial.
Stop trying to act like you got this under control.
I see the empty Monster cans in the wastebasket.
You have no idea how to fix this.
I was up late because I was watching Bad Santa, the unrated version, then I watched the first Austin Powers, then I watched back-to-back episodes of Jake in Progress, which is a misleading title because Jake always makes the same mistakes.
You do realize there's not even a ball in there.
Okay.
I will be my charming self, I will smooth things over with the Chief, and everything is going to be fine.
And then we'll go for Dilly Bars.
You have nobody to blame but yourselves, particularly when it comes to this psychic.
Okay.
Instead of pointing fingers, let's focus on next steps.
Fine.
I strongly suggest that SBPD take a long look at their methods.
Duly noted.
But do you think you can refrain from making a statement just long enough for us to prepare for the media firestorm that is about to come down?
This injustice to the people of Santa Barbara was a direct result of a lack of quality control at the police department, specifically with regards to their use of special consultants.
Mr. Czarsky!
My office, along with SBPD internal affairs, vows to hold everyone involved in this botched investigation accountable.
No further questions.
Where the hell is he, Henry?
I'm a psychic, Chief.
You know I need to be in the vicinity of objects and their energies.
I need to pat them, prick them, mark them with a B. That's how it works.
It's like the chicken and the egg, minus the egg, I think.
And possibly the chicken.
If we had waited around for a warrant, this thing could have gone the other way.
Mr. Spencer Phew!
First fight.
I thought it would never end.
Shawn, shut up.
I have been given an ultimatum by the mayor.
And as a result, the department has decided to take preemptive action.
About time I was issued a weapon.
I'm placing you on suspension.
Indefinitely.
Indefinitely?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, make up your mind, Chief.
Am I suspended or not?
You made your bed, kid.
I haven't made my bed in 15 years.
In addition, Internal Affairs is going to want to speak with you, so I'd advise you not to leave town.
I've been telling you all along.
Your blatant disregard for protocol, your reckless police work, it was Furthermore, I've notified the mayor that as a result of you failing to control your special consultants, your position is being dissolved.
Effective immediately.
Meaning what, Karen?
Your services are no longer required.
What exactly are you trying to say?
You're fired, Henry.
Dad, you are overreacting.
This kind of stuff happens to me all the time.
Give me a few days.
I'll figure something out for the both of us.
As usual, any sense of responsibility for your actions is too little, too late.
I simply cannot comprehend how you can be so careless, considering who your father is.
Beats me.
Must have been one of those lessons you neglected to teach me back when your job was more important than your family.
Hey, raising you is no easy job.
And it's not like I had your mother around to give me Screw it.
It doesn't matter.
Oh, Shawn.
Oh.
I'm just so tired of the grind.
You and me spinning our wheels, going in opposite directions.
I can't help but wonder what our lives might have been like if you'd just stayed wherever the hell you were and not come back to Santa Barbara five years ago.
Wow.
Maybe you're right, maybe I shouldn't have come back.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end As reported earlier, the People's case against Czarsky relied solely upon the evidence obtained from this unlawful Hey, buddy, watching the news on a loop.
I guess there is such thing as bad publicity, huh?
You're still pissed.
All right, I'll try you back in 20.
Along with SBPD, Internal Affairs vows to hold I can't help but wonder what our lives might have been like if you'd just stayed wherever the hell you were and not come back to Santa Barbara five years ago.
You're fired.
Maybe you're right, maybe I shouldn't have come back.
Gus!
Gus, where are your pants?
Are you smoking a pipe?
Say something.
Say anything.
You're really starting to freak me out here.
What the Whoa!
Oh, hey!
All right, okay, we give up.
We surrender.
Hey.
I know you.
You're Tony Cox.
You're Marcus from Bad Santa.
You're awesome.
Kiss my rock-hard bubble of an ass.
Now you clearly associate little people with cookies and holiday pageantry.
Voilà!
I have seen Friday 79 times.
Willow, remember that?
Your little warrior with the long weave.
Thank you.
Disaster Movie?
Check.
Look, the bottom line is, I'm one of your biggest fans, so maybe you want to take that chip off your shoulder.
The bottom line is, it's snowing Styrofoam and I'm stuck here.
Why?
Because I'm your superego.
No kidding.
Boy, I wish I could show you to all the people that say I should be more humble.
Look, you picked me because you think you can bully me.
Now here.
Oh, look at that.
It's the Psych office.
Look, it's me Oh, I'm sitting and watching the Czarsky footage.
Oh!
I'm dreaming.
I get it.
Well, in that case, you want to hot tub with Paula Patton?
Yes!
No.
Look, you don't get it.
You're supposed to go on a journey of self-discovery, you boob.
Now let's do this, because you got me wearing a dance belt up in here, son.
Oh, sorry about that.
Oh.
Paul Bunyan, really?
Look, I'm trying to avoid all kinds of stereotypes here.
Would you prefer Kareem Abdul Jabbar?
Pre or post-'fro?
Post.
Forget you.
First stop is your dad's place.
I don't want to go there.
This is my dream.
Your journey is to see what would have happened to the people you care about if you had never come back home to Santa Barbara.
Now it was your dad's words that were echoing in your fat head as you drifted off, remember?
Yeah.
Those were ugly words.
But you mostly deserved it.
You deserved it.
Suck it.
You suck it.
Just for that, there's your exit.
Huh?
Oh, man, that's messed up.
That's what you get for putting me in suspenders.
What?
What?
Oh, God.
Oh, dude, it reeks in here.
Like Bigfoot's ass.
Oh, my God.
My dad turned into Nick Nolte.
Oh!
When's the last time he bathed himself?
Hey, Maddie, it's Henry.
Don't you think maybe you rushed into this wedding thing?
Wedding?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, my mom's marrying an African prince?
I was just sitting here, thinking about that time I took you to Crystal Palace over in Bakersfield.
Remember how you accidentally kneed Buck Owens right in the whoppers?
Oh, come on, Maddie.
Maddie, don't go.
Madeleine.
Man has to have some respect for himself.
Wow.
He is really taking this hard.
I guess he was dead wrong.
It's a good thing I came back after all.
You do realize you're pulling all the strings in these dreams?
You did this to make yourself feel better.
It's embarrassing.
Stop trying to twist this.
I can't help it if my dad is lost without me.
We should leave now before we're eaten by flies.
Who's next?
It's Gus.
Now, his old lady has a kid from a different baby daddy.
His alcoholic mother-in-law lives with them, too, and I'm pretty sure they live next door to Edie McClurg.
That sounds like a UPN sitcom from the mid '90s.
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Can we watch Gus' life like it was a sitcom?
It's your dream.
What?
Give your daddy a fist bump.
He ain't my daddy.
What's happening, Anfernee?
You ain't my daddy.
Is that all he says?
This season.
Last year, it was, "Sniff this, eunuch".
Mmm.
Mmm.
That's some sweet sugar, Burton.
Wow.
You really do that to your boy?
What?
To sitcom Gus?
Absolutely.
This is brilliant.
So, how was your day today, wife?
You know my cousin Shereafer from the city?
Well, she moved in with us today.
Oh, and Anfernee learned that drugs are for thugs.
He ain't my daddy.
Here's the weird thing, I think this is a rerun.
Okay, now it's time for us to go.
We've already eaten.
I think there's some cereal in the pantry.
Oh, babe, would you mind taking a look at those credit card bills and paying them?
Thank you.
Mwah.
Oh, time to get our fit on.
Let's go.
Still ain't my daddy.
A spokesperson for the SBPD found it odd that the surveillance footage wasn't submitted earlier in the proceedings.
Wait, why did she sound like a news reporter all of a sudden?
You left the TV on, remember?
Oh, look at that.
Wow.
This is really horrible.
Gus is so underappreciated around here.
Bingo.
Now you're getting it.
Your imagination is dark and ridiculous, but at least the message is buried in there somewhere.
Oh, you mean that everyone would be miserable if I hadn't come back to Santa Barbara?
I could have told you that.
Boy, you in for a surprise.
Man, you can't just say I'm in for a surprise and then eat a ginger snap.
I can do anything I want.
So now what?
Wait for it!
Told you.
What is this place?
Halt!
Halt!
Repositioning.
Don't move.
Don't breathe.
Don't think.
The Chief wishes to speak.
Why does Chief Vick have a German accent?
Because you watched Austin Powers last night and you have a thing for Frau Farbissina.
And now so do I. Thank you, Frau Vick.
Oh!
Gentlemen, I will not mince words.
It has been brought to my attention that only 31% of arrested assailants have sustained gunshot wounds.
Now this I'm sure you all realize is entirely unacceptable!
Unacceptable!
We do not provide you with the heavy firearms you wear near your hearts and the endless ammunition so that you can finesse justice.
Do we, Junior Detective McNab?
No, sir!
You give them to us so we can shoot criminals.
As you were.
It is believed Czarsky has interest in several small businesses on Santa Barbara's west side, though his affiliations remain unconfirmed.
So because I never came back, she ends up getting demoted and Lassie ends up with his dream job.
At least they respect him.
Oh, poor McNab.
So, you see?
Not everybody's worse off without you.
All the more reason I needed to come home.
I'm a savior.
I saved the SBPD.
Wow.
You're so insecure.
Wait a minute.
Where's Jules?
Oh.
You weren't here to out Lassiter's secret tryst with his old partner, so the timing didn't work out for her transfer to Santa Barbara.
Wait, she's still in Miami?
Well, let's get out of here.
What are we waiting for?
You might want to sit down.
What about you?
Bye-bye.
Please keep your hands and feet in at all times.
All lowered and locked position.
Whoa.
We have no backup.
They have heavy artillery.
We called for backup, Bachynsky.
If we lose them, we have nothing to back up.
It also means we suck.
Jules, this is so hot.
You're like Heather Locklear in T.J. Hooker, which means he's Adrian Zmed.
Wait a minute.
Are you dating Dwyane Wade?
That doesn't even make sense.
He's with Gabrielle Union.
All units, all units, we are about to engage in a suicide mission.
Please come and save me.
What are you doing?
No!
No!
No!
Wait!
No!
Cover me.
No way!
I'm going fetal!
Damn it!
Oh, what were you guys waiting for?
Canadian Thanksgiving?
Up the fire escape!
Go!
Go!
Hey, why couldn't we just let them go?
Because they're violent criminals and they smuggled those cigars.
You know what?
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
I need to transfer to somewhere like Santa Barbara.
Oh, that would be nice.
I'd probably be a detective by now.
Authorities have long since been investigating Czarsky's ties to the Miami-Dade County area.
And now sports with Collin Hillis.
What the hell happened to you?
You missed all the action.
All I missed was getting tossed around like a black lotto ball.
Oh, that, and Juliet almost getting killed up here in the 'hood.
She's very lucky I came back.
I had no idea what a major role I played in her career development.
How much longer are you going to stay in denial, huh?
How much more time do we have?
Get out of the car.
Can I be perfectly honest with you?
I can't feel anything below my chin.
Oh, no.
Gus is melting.
I need to wake up.
Not until you learn your lesson.
I did.
I learned how important I am to everyone.
This isn't about them.
Haven't you seen It's a Wonderful Life?
No.
I can't do black and white.
How about A Christmas Carol?
You know what I did see?
Elf.
How come you're not in that movie?
It's not about me and which roles I should have gotten over Dinklage.
What do you think you would be doing if you hadn't come back home, Shawn?
Huh?
Working the Wienermobile in Madison?
Or giving tours at Graceland?
Hey, Elvis has his own racquetball court.
Those jobs were fun.
It was just you bouncing around, avoiding responsibility and emotional commitment.
I mean, sure it was fun back then.
You were a kid.
It's time to grow up, or you're going to lose the people that care about you the most.
I am?
I guess I can afford to make a stride or two.
Yeah, you could.
Hey, don't give in to him, you sellout.
Where the hell did you come from?
Your butt.
Who is this?
Us.
As a kid.
Doesn't look like "us as a kid".
Well, we changed.
Sometimes from week to week, huh?
It's true.
We made a deal to never grow up.
And I held up my end like a champion.
I know you did, but you know what?
It was easier for you.
It's acceptable to act like a 12-year-old when you're actually a 12-year-old.
Well, you were doing just fine, too, until little Frodo Jenkins here came along.
Dude, I will lay him out.
He didn't mean that.
Uh, yes, I did.
Dude, he's ripping us apart.
So dramatic.
Go to your room, or do whatever you want.
Go!
You're freaking me out!
Go!
You don't have to kill your inner child.
Just take responsibility for your decisions and the way they affect others, you mutton head.
Hey.
You don't have to be a little bastard.
Yes, I do.
That's the only way I can penetrate your thick skull.
I think I got it.
I really do.
It's about damn time.
Look, it's a snow bunny!
Where?
Hey, there's no You don't mind the ox, Cox.
Come on, Babe.
Don't be a stranger.
I'm kidding.
Be a stranger.
I was right about those cameras.
There weren't any.
That surveillance footage was shot from the outside.
Who am I talking to?
Oh, brown-snowman Gus, I think I'll miss you most of all.
Hey.
Thank you.
Now, Shawn, make this quick.
I had to pick up two extra routes now that we're suspended.
My case weighs over 60 pounds.
Gus, the light bulb came on.
I've had a catheter.
Catharsis.
You're my big, sweet, brown rock and you always have been.
I'm not giving you any money, Shawn.
No, no, no.
I should have listened to you.
I'm sorry.
Of all the relationships in my life, ours is easily the most stable and the only one I haven't screwed up.
If I hadn't come back to Santa Barbara, I don't know what you'd be doing, but wherever I was, I'd be wishing I had you there to lean on.
Just like the first time I got kicked out of little league for corking my bats.
Just like I am now.
I need you to help me out of this mess, buddy.
Shawn, look, you're my boy.
And if you hadn't come back, I'd probably be married some kind of material girl and playing in a men's over-30 dodge ball league.
They have those?
Of course they do.
And look, I'm glad you found your clarity, but I don't think there's any way to possibly get out of this one.
I have two backstage passes to Ralph Tresvant next weekend that says there is.
Yes, we can.
What have we got?
Stealth mode.
See, I had to go to sleep and dream in order to think straight, but I was right.
There were no security cameras in that room.
So how did Czarsky's defense get that footage of you?
It was shot through a window.
From the outside?
From the angle of the video, the surveillance footage was shot from that window over there.
What do you say?
Do you smell that?
I ate a bran muffin.
I needed something quick.
I'm talking about inside there, Shawn.
Whatever it is, it's petroleum based.
Huh.
Where do you think the super sniffer ranks among other heroes' powers?
Below x-ray vision and weather control, but definitely better than anything Robin brings to the table.
Which is nothing.
Exactly.
He's a liability.
So is Batgirl.
Whoever lives here is home and does not want to be disturbed.
Census bureau.
So what's our move?
Brace yourself, Gus.
We're going to have to play by the book.
It'll be difficult, but I'm going to help you through it.
I always play by the book.
I know.
We are going to use impulse control, which is the practice of controlling one's impulses.
For instance, I look down and see that roach there and I tell myself, I can't eat that.
Do I need to slap you in the face?
Let's focus.
We're going to bring the police in on this lead before we do anything else.
What are you staring at?
I'm telling myself I can't squeeze your sweet, sweet head.
All right, Dobson, it's worth a shot.
Lassie, I know, I know I am the last person on Earth that you want to see right now, but I brought you something.
Where's Jules?
If you must know, she's out trying to find a new lead on the Czarsky case.
Cleaning up your mess of epic proportion has been taking its toll on everyone.
And while I usually have no time for you, today I actually have less than no time for you.
Lassie, listen.
It's no secret that we've had our beefs, our riffs, our Static.
In the past.
But I have recently taken a long look at the man in the mirror.
What I discovered was, in spite of always giving you such a hard time about being too uptight, too rigid, the truth is, I could have gotten a lot further in my own life if I'd had even half of your discipline.
And posture.
Sure.
And the stern bush.
Absolutely.
And my pursuit driving ability.
If you need to hear that then, yes.
Now, come on, let's hug it out.
I would rather fall in love with a vegan.
That's fair.
Look, this lack of animosity between us is kind of freaking me out right now.
I've had a psychic vision about a location that may yield new evidence in the Czarsky case.
Spencer, you're on suspension, and technically I shouldn't even be talking to you right now.
All we're going to do is take a drive.
Once we get there, we will do everything your way.
That's if you still want to catch this bastard.
I'll drive.
This is it?
Yep.
And I'm sensing that nobody's home.
SBPD!
What is that odor?
Whatever it is, it's flammable.
Which is something I like to call cause.
This is it.
This is where the surveillance footage was shot from.
You stay here until I clear the room.
He wasn't watching me.
He was watching Czarsky.
Hey, is it area codes or state capitals that you're all Rain Man-y with?
I'm Rain Man with area codes.
State capitals, I'm more like John Nash.
The dude from Clean House?
That's Niecy Nash, Shawn.
She's a fine full-bodied woman.
What?
Uh, 305.
Miami and all of South Florida.
State capital, Tallahassee.
Authorities have long since been investigating Czarsky's ties to the Miami-Dade County area.
Hola, Juan.
Que?
Juan?
Guys, you're going to want to get in here.
Hola.
Uh, trampolina gigante.
I got to go, man.
Juan?
Here we come.
This seems to be the source of the odor.
And there's this.
Whoever took that footage of you, sure seems to have his own axe to grind with Czarsky, but it doesn't make sense.
This guy was building a bomb to kill Czarsky.
I'm getting something.
I think this may go back to the time Czarsky spent in Miami, and I'm getting a name.
Juan.
It's Miami.
You got anything else?
He lives here now.
He's from Miami.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Get this, Vice was trying to nail Czarsky on extortion in Miami for years, which is why he moved his dirty business to the west coast.
The night before he disappeared, a restaurant, Tacos al Carmen, was in the hotbed of Czarsky's operations, it burned to the ground.
Dang.
I would give anything for a taco right now.
One of the proprietors was killed in the fire, Carmen Verin.
She co-owned the restaurant with a Juan Lava.
A Juan from Miami with a score to settle with Czarsky.
Good job, Spencer.
No, no, no, that feels a little weird.
I'm sensing there's something more to the story.
Our Juan wasn't the culinary type.
We're going to stake the place out until little Billy Bomb-maker comes home.
Guster, you take Spencer, take your fun little car, park behind Czarsky's lair, keep an eye out for that snake while we wait for Lava.
Anything new?
Nope.
He's still playing poker and drinking absinthe with the ponytail guys.
You know they say the wormwood in absinthe makes your shadow glow.
We should do shots and then play laser tag.
Shawn, you need to try to take a nap.
You look tired.
Gus, don't be Keith Sweat now.
I'm sharp as a tack.
Hey, long time, no see.
Not long enough.
That's not very nice.
Why am I back here?
Tell me that.
Perhaps your work on this planet isn't done.
I'm not from another planet.
Well, regardless.
My dad won't take my calls.
He won't see me.
Not surprising.
Oftentimes on these journeys of character discovery, I've found that one relationship proves more difficult than the others to rectify.
Is that right?
How many of these things have you done?
I don't owe you an explanation.
Answer me this, why did he take that job in the first place, huh?
I guess he wanted to protect me during the Yin investigation.
Maybe in his own way he's still protecting you.
And maybe he's enjoying working with you in the process.
You ever think of that?
I'm still here.
Normally, folks kind of blink me away when they come to a realization.
You get it?
Well, Mr. Snowball Slinger to the Face, I happen to be a big fan of the awkward exit.
I hate you.
Shawn.
Kareem, you took off your goggles.
What?
What?
That was Lassiter.
They've had Juan in interrogation for an hour, but he won't talk.
He wants you to give it a try.
But on the DL, since technically you're still suspended.
I will crack him.
I will crack him like a chestnut.
You stay here, Gus.
Call if you see anything weird, okay?
You realize I'm going to have to take the Blueberry?
Juan, my name is Shawn.
I know who you are.
I'm here to help.
And I loved you in Y tu mamá también.
I'm a Cuban-American in my 30s.
Those guys were Mexican teenagers played by guys in their 20s.
That's fair.
One of the proprietors died in the fire, Carmen Verin.
She co-owned the restaurant with a Juan Lava.
Carmen.
She was more than just your business partner.
She was your fiancée, wasn't she?
Yes.
You opened that restaurant for her, Juan.
And Czarsky destroyed it.
He took my whole world away that night, and they ruled it an accident.
If Czarsky goes to jail for tax fraud, he can still hurt people.
If that's the best you can do, that's not good enough.
I was casing that guy for months.
You got in the way.
I had no choice but to turn over that footage.
He wouldn't have done any real time.
The only way to stop a guy like Czarsky is to put him in the ground.
No, Juan, you are not murderer.
You are a good man.
And if you kill this guy, you will spend the rest of your life in jail.
I will make you a promise.
I will nail this guy for a hell of a lot more than tax fraud, but you've got to give me a chance, man.
Give me a chance.
It's too late.
Forgive me.
Czarsky going to blow up in 24 minutes!
We've got less than 15.
Tell me exactly where the bomb is and how to diffuse it.
Tell me, you can still have a life.
Tell me, Juan.
Think of Carmen.
Tell me now.
Now.
It's about time we got some law and order around here.
Shut up.
I didn't join the force to save world-class scumbags like you.
All right, Secure the perimeter and brace for impact.
I swear to God, if I lose one of my people.
Clear!
Clear!
Long time, no see.
How's that pretty little lady of yours?
She's not still smoking, I hope.
Keep laughing.
All the way to San Quentin.
Never get anyone to testify against me.
Not in this lifetime.
No.
I will testify.
Haven't you embarrassed yourself enough already?
Hardly.
I'm just getting started, you giant cockroach.
You know what?
That was out of line.
I apologize to cockroaches everywhere, especially Jiminy Cricket, although for the first time in over 30 years, it occurs to me he might be a cricket.
Of course he's a cricket.
I will testify that even though I can't prove it, Czarsky is extorting your hard-earned wages, making you pay by threatening your lives and the lives of your loved ones.
I will testify that even though I can't prove it, Czarsky uses your legitimate businesses as fences for his criminal operations and dastardly deeds.
We took an oath to serve and protect you.
But we can't always do it on our own.
Sometimes we need your help.
We know this is easy for us to say.
We don't know how it feels to be you, but there is someone who does.
I do.
That man killed my fiancée.
Her name was Carmen.
Her dream was to have her own restaurant.
She had a gift she wanted to share with as many people as possible.
They would light up when they ate her food and she would light up watching them.
We refused to pay him for nothing so he burned our restaurant down, but she was still inside.
Think of your families, your children, any one of you could be next, and he's just getting started.
I know you're scared, but he can't touch us if we stand together.
Nice try.
Got me right here.
I will testify.
He collects on Thursdays, and I can prove it.
I will testify.
He stashes his contraband in my garage.
I'm done being afraid.
You bet your ass I'll testify.
Sergei Czarsky, it gives me great pleasure to say that you are under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.
All the way to San Quentin.
You Lassie, before you go off on me, I was way, way off on the whole bomb thing.
It turns out Juan here was just counting down the minutes to tonight's season premiere of True Blood.
Sookie.
Nice try, Spencer.
That bomb would have blown us all to hell if it weren't for Captain Lane Scott Thomas here and the entire bomb squad.
Actually, Detective, it was a false alarm.
Huh?
We were clear because there was no bomb.
My team searched every inch of that building.
Like I said, my bad.
But it all worked out in the end, huh?
Let's hit it, O'Hara.
We've got a lot of booking to do.
Best Christmas I've had since ever.
Catch.
Well, it looks like you're free to go, Mr. Lava.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
You guys want some eggnog?
Yes.
Juan Lava's lactose-free eggnog.
Are you guys hearing me?
Do you understand how jingly it is?
Because as soon as you hear Lava, you're not thinking about lactose.
Okay, Shawn, that's enough.
Seriously.
Juan, that took some real courage speaking up.
Thank you guys for giving me a second chance.
I think I'm going to stay here for a while.
Good for you.
Yeah, I like it here.
Really?
It's super cheap.
Hmm.
Take care, guys.
Okay, Juan.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah.
All right, let's see it.
Don't you ever, ever ask me to diffuse a bomb again.
You hear me?
Whoo!
You take the red wire.
You cut that one first.
Come on, the instructions were so simple.
And look at that, you did it with three and a half minutes to spare.
You know my thumbs flutter like humming bird wings in high-pressure situations.
You were brilliant, as usual.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Where's the rest of the bomb?
The dumpster behind the ampm.
Nice.
Well, let's hit DQ country.
I believe I owe you a Dilly Bar.
We have no car, Shawn.
It's not too far.
We can walk it.
Just like we did in little league.
Impressive work, Mr. Spencer.
You really turned things around.
Well, the truth is, I don't deserve credit for righting a wrong that was mine to begin with.
Lassiter and Juliet are the ones that should be commended.
Which is what I told the mayor.
I also spoke to Internal Affairs.
Right.
Considering we were able to get Czarsky on much more serious charges than we had before, they've concluded their investigation.
Really?
But that doesn't change the fact that you caused this department a great deal of embarrassment.
So I don't want to see your face around here, at least until after the New Year.
That's more than fair.
In the spirit of the Yuletide, might I make a request of my own, Chief?
I'm listening.
It's not for me.
It's It's for my dad, right?
I mean, he's kind of been a different man, if you hadn't noticed, since he started working here again.
I mean, his eating habits haven't changed and he still watches reruns of The Rifleman, but Your father can have his job back if he wants it, Shawn.
But the rules are still going to be the same.
You're still going to have to answer to him.
Oh, I know.
Yes, I know.
Thank you, Chief.
Thank you.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Spencer.
May I, for the road?
Please.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Everyone, can I have your attention please?
Attention.
Two, three, eyes on me.
Excuse me.
Everyone.
Listen up!
This is my kid sister, Lauren Lassiter.
Hello, everybody.
Come on, man.
Who is she really?
There's no way that's your sister.
Stop screwing with us.
This is my sister.
Not genetically though, right?
Yes, genetically, you idiot!
What's the matter with you?
Okay, all right, I get it.
There might be a little age difference between us but I can assure you, although she may not have been traditionally planned, she was a happy accident.
So my kid sister here is a very talented filmmaker.
And she's working on her graduate thesis.
It's going to be a documentary film about the nitty gritty police work.
Yes, I want to document how real crime is solved and I couldn't imagine a better way than to follow my amazing, awe inspiring big brother, Carlton.
Now, she is going to be following me 24/7, waking and sleeping.
Not sleeping.
Obviously the subject of said film is me, however some of you may find yourself on camera as background players, atmosphere, nothings.
No, no, no, no, no.
These are very important roles, all of you.
I'm warning you, no showboating.
Do you understand?
You, what the hell do you think you're doing?
Putting away a file.
And why is that, huh?
You're trying to get on camera, aren't you?
I'm a file clerk.
That's what I do, put files away.
Oh, and you just had to come all the way over here to do it?
This is where the file cabinet is.
Oh, hello.
Chief Vick got a call about a body at the zoo.
Nice!
Excellent!
Yes!
Sweet.
Sweet, nice.
Somebody's dead, there's nothing really nice about it.
Um, it's been assigned to us.
It is our case.
This is weird.
All right, people, did you hear that?
We have a case to solve.
All right.
High fives.
How was I?
It was good.
Um, I was an accident?
You know, this doesn't seem like a normal city issue police vehicle.
Good eye.
It isn't.
The cruiser's in the shop.
This is my personal vehicle.
It's a Ford Fusion.
It's a hybrid.
It's new.
Sort of the trappings that come with my station in life.
You mounted a police radio in your personal car?
You kidding?
I'm having one built in my shower.
I'm a 21st century crime fighter.
I'm very dialed-in with all the latest cutting-edge technologies.
In fact, here, look at this.
See this?
Uh-huh.
It's the sync button.
With one finger, I can access your daily horoscope.
Horoscope.
Pisces.
Pisces.
Today's horoscope.
It's time to get other's opinions and feedback about yourself You realize we're going to be late to our own crime scene?
Detective O'Hara's right.
We should probably go.
Hey, but later, maybe we can see how this baby does in a high speed pursuit, huh?
How do you know there's going to be a pursuit?
I have my ways.
Hey, Lassie.
Hi, Jules.
How'd you guys find out about this already?
Well, first off, Gus follows several of the zebras on Twitter, and his phone is blowing up with Tweets.
I follow the exotic birds and they're actually Tweeting.
And finally we heard someone was making a motion picture.
Now, wait a minute, Lassie, this can't be your sister.
She seems so normal and human-like.
And perfect.
Stop it.
That's Lassie's sister.
They share the same DNA.
Sharing is caring.
I will not let this happen, I promise you.
Oh, please, I'm a player.
Hello, I'm Shawn Spencer.
This is my partner, Radio Star.
I'm afraid your video will kill him.
That's not true.
The name is Burton, and the camera has loved me since I've been a baby.
I know all about you guys.
I did my research.
Really?
Oh, great.
So then you know that Gus has hepatitis K. What are you doing?
I am preventing a nightmare.
What are you doing?
Would you just Just come on.
Come on.
Free the bear!
Free the bear!
Back off, hippie.
They're protestors, Carlton.
Same diff.
Oh.
I'm not trying to be involved with a bear crime, Shawn.
What did you think it was going to be when you heard "body at the zoo," Gus?
Some guy who got killed by giraffe kisses?
The bear apparently turned on its trainer, Jasper Zane, in the middle of the night last night.
Zoo officials found his body this morning.
Oh, my god, that was terrible.
Can I do that again?
Are we the animal cops now?
Whoa, whoa, guys, get her out of here.
No spectators, ma'am.
Please back up.
I'm not a spectator.
My name is Gemma Kraemer and that trainer was my fiancé.
Oh.
Oh, well, I'm going to need to take your statement.
Jasper rescued this bear as a cub.
He loved it.
He devoted his life to it and now this happens?
This shouldn't have happened!
All right.
I'm sorry.
Everybody, hold on.
Has anyone touched that body?
Come here.
I've got to go in there.
I how do I actually get in there?
All right, Lulu, let me show you how a detective surveys a crime scene.
There's a very specific method to it, an order.
Lulu?
Oh, it's short for Lewis.
He gave me the nickname when I was a kid because I was a tomboy.
A late bloomer.
Better late than never.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Wow.
What must it be like to have the privilege to work alongside my brother every day?
Isn't he amazing?
You're amazing.
The way you press that record button and whatnot.
He used to run hurdles in high school until he strained his groin.
You know, Gus here doesn't have a groin.
That's a true story.
Oh.
Lulu!
Why?
Because you're being super creepy.
Okay, here we go.
See, here's what happened, the trainer comes in the enclosure after hours, he startles the bear.
Based on the blood splatter, the first strike is here, then he is knocked over these rocks, dragged to this point here, he was attacked again.
Eventually, he rolled down here, coming to a stop where he expires on the stairs.
You know what, I'm not sure he didn't just fall.
Something isn't right.
Okay, Lu, I'm going to bring you the good stuff.
I'm going to say the bear did it, case closed.
At that point you're probably going to want to come in nice and close to my face, okay?
Everybody listen up.
Wait!
Wait!
I'm having a thought!
More of a revelation!
That polar bear did not commit murder.
It was framed.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know So, when you said that polar bear was framed, was that a joke?
Nope, not a joke.
The part about me not having a groin, that was a joke.
So like with the sea lion and the dinosaur Uh, my brother tells me it is your M.O. To come up with something ridiculous and just hope for the best.
Well, that and have T-shirts made of said hunch and try to launch myself a catchphrase.
Wow.
You two really don't take police work very seriously, do you?
Well, that's really more Shawn.
I'm the more mature, rational one.
At the root, I'm mostly a businessman.
Oh, really?
You should see Gus when he gets out the shower.
He likes to be swaddled and burped.
I believe they call that baby-ism.
He's crazy.
Be careful.
It can get hairy in here.
Okay.
Wow, that really is a dead body.
Is it weird for you guys to be in the same room with a corpse?
Gus?
Oh, I'm fine over here with the beakers and whatnot.
Just so I can finish the paperwork, tell me the bear killed this guy.
In my professional opinion, this was definitely a bear attack.
Thank you.
Oh, can you say that again for the camera?
Whoa, whoa, Woody, Woody.
Wait, don't, don't.
Isn't it possible that the bear did not kill this man?
Absolutely.
Sure.
What?
Which is it?
Sorry.
I'm a people pleaser.
Ah, young lady, what media outlet were you from again?
Oh, it's for my graduate thesis film.
Will it be entered in any festivals in the eastern hemisphere?
Specifically the Philippines?
Maybe.
Oh, my God.
This is going to be in festivals?
May we get on with the body please?
Broken bones, check.
Lacerations, check.
Claw marks, check.
What is that voice?
I'm distorting it for legal reasons.
That is a process done in editing.
Really?
I always thought people did that themselves.
No.
Well, I'll be.
Huh.
Here's something fun, let it be noted the victim's larynx was crushed.
He was choked?
Polar bears have opposable thumbs now?
No.
And what about motive?
You can't convict without motive.
I have motive.
The bear went bear.
You're not helping.
I'm not trying to.
Stop hating on bears.
If they stop first.
Come on, guys, this bear's going to be euthanized for no reason.
Uh, we need to get back to the zoo.
O'Hara, stop making up things to get on camera.
Now.
You know, he broke through this.
Oh.
And then, you know, this is all his whole pen.
He's got it all So, Mr. Banting, what happened here?
The polar bear broke out of the cage.
And then what do you think happened?
He just bought some cotton candy and walked out of the zoo?
Well, by the time my team realized it was missing, it got too big of a head start.
I guess we know what the bear would do for a Klondike bar.
What?
I just felt like my character needed a joke.
Ah, what is that?
Oh, this is a ring-tailed lemur.
He has been acting out, experiencing depression, very needy.
Hence, the one-on-one attention.
Did you see any Coca-Colas or a sled?
I believe this might be what he's using for nourishment, transportation.
And did anyone see a red scarf?
Or hear the sound, "Wee"?
That polar bear was our main attraction.
Come on, don't look at me with those judgmental eyes, Tobias.
It is what it is.
I got bear tracks.
Headed northwest.
All right, listen up, I want a hard target search on this killer bear.
We're going to hunt this thing down, we're going to find it.
Let's go.
Go where?
Why are you harassing the lemur?
He started it.
All right, look, there's an innocent bear loose in Santa Barbara, we need to find it.
If there's a loose bear running around in Santa Barbara, I'm not in Santa Barbara.
You ever know a polar bear that tried to force itself into its cage?
No, Shawn, because I don't know any polar bears and neither do you.
Sure, the fence was pushed out, but the hinges broke inward and that tells the real story.
Free the bear!
Free the bear!
That bear definitely had help.
And I have a decent idea who's behind it.
I'm out.
You got this alone.
Are you serious?
I'm dead serious.
I don't even like bears in fables, Shawn.
Goldilocks was a crazy blonde shortie for going up in that house in the first place.
Don't say shortie.
Shortie.
You're going to the bunny den, aren't you?
Don't be making that your business.
Why are you talking like that?
I'm deep in the streets, Shawn.
You're on a wooded path to nowhere.
I just don't like bears, Shawn.
You're not here to buy my van, are you?
Look, I'm a psychic.
I'm filthy good.
I have an appetite for the truth, so I'm going to ask you a very simple question.
Where is the bear?
Don't worry about the bear.
The bear is safe.
I'm the one that's trying to keep it from getting euthanized.
Wow.
This is great news.
It means we're playing for the same team.
You and me, we're the same except I shower occasionally, and I worked at an Arby's once.
Let me tell you something, I'm not just some random tree hugger, all right?
Don't try to put me in your little box.
Here's one I bet you didn't know, I make my own bath salts.
Surprising.
I make people smell like plums and sunshine.
Yeah, I do that.
Can I get you anything?
Ah, let's see.
You know what I'll have the beef dip.
I'm just kidding.
She took that so seriously.
You listen to me, that bear is innocent, you got me?
That bear didn't do anything.
You said so yourself at the crime scene.
And I meant it.
Given time, I will prove it.
I will find the killer.
But think about this, dude, I found you pretty easily, which means the head of the Santa Barbara police department and a bunch of animal control officers aren't far behind.
It's just, there's not a lot of places to take a polar bear in this city.
But you're in luck.
You see, polar bear relocation just happens to be my specialty, Jack.
That and marzipan sugar sculpturing.
So you tell me where the bear is, I will help you and I will help the bear.
And I will sculpt you a swan made entirely of molasses.
I want a turtle.
Done.
Yeah, there it is.
Ah.
Ah, yeah.
Dude, dude, I know what you're thinking here.
I don't think you do, Shawn.
Gus, I want you to meet someone.
This is MacLeod Sinclair.
He's an activist and he knows bears, even ones that are bad news.
In fact, he lived amongst them at Yellowstone, and he has a signed Dan Haggerty eight by 10, so you know we're in good hands here.
Unless you tell me he has super powers and one of them being stronger than a bear Gus, see that wire?
That, my friend, is an electric fence and the bear is trained not to cross it.
It's not a real electric fence.
It's just there to fool the bear.
How did that make sense to say aloud?
Dude.
I don't want to be the uptight one here, but we simply cannot keep a bear in the Psych office held in by a piece of kite string.
What do you want to do?
Take it for a stroll on the boardwalk?
We have to keep it hidden.
And Lassie is out there with every available source of manpower hunting it down.
He's hunting it because it kills things, Shawn.
You know who kills things?
Zoos.
Zoos kill things.
Mind if I get on my soapbox here?
I prefer you get in the soapbox.
I showered yesterday.
You realize that's the day before today?
Look, the point is, okay, is that keeping animals in fake rock habitats with plastic kiddy pools is criminal.
Anyone that had any heart, any compassion at all would shut down all zoos, especially one that would keep a polar bear in those conditions.
Animals were not meant to be in captivity.
Or in my office.
I'll tell you what, I don't feel one ounce of sympathy for that trainer, man.
If you ask me, he had it coming.
Oh, yeah.
Will you excuse us for just one moment, MacLeod?
Sure.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
That you aligned yourself with a fanatical animal activist who had a death wish for our victim?
Oh, my gosh, we're totally aiding and abetting a murderer.
I'm not doing anything, Shawn.
You're the one who brought the world's largest terrestrial predator into our kitchenette.
Well, either way, we need to get out there so we can prove it.
I agree.
And we need to take the bear.
I do not agree, Shawn.
What's wrong with you?
MacLeod, how do you feel about a coffee run, man?
I'm buying.
Is it organic?
All right, people, listen up, this bear spent the night somewhere and it's probably hungry by now.
There are more restaurants and dumpsters per square foot in this area than anywhere else in the city.
We will cover every alleyway, every back way, every rooftop until we find it.
This bear will not escape me.
Let's go.
Fan out!
Okay.
Are we seriously doing this?
Look, I called Benihana and much to my chagrin', they could not accommodate a table for two plus an 800 pound polar bear.
We need to start thinking like a bear.
I'm not going to maul an innocent hiker, Shawn.
Hello and welcome to Crabby Mel's, what can I get you?
Ah, what do you want, a Coke?
Can we have two Cokes, a large fry and fish sandwiches, tartar sauce, no buns.
Shawn.
What?
We need to pay a visit to the trainer's house.
Whoever wanted him dead may have left a trail.
Or a picnic basket.
You didn't even consider asking Lassiter to get a key.
It's much, much easier this way.
For who?
You know you have a better equilibrium with those staunch birthing hips.
Hurry up before the neighbors see us and someone calls the cops.
I need closer.
Ah.
Have you figured out anything yet?
I did figure something out.
I really enjoy being lifted.
Excuse me, can I help you?
Uh, yes.
Have you seen another set of guys that look like us?
We seem to have lost track of our chicken fight.
This is serious business.
I'm not even remotely joking.
If any of you has seen this bear, you better tell me now.
You may think it's a big fluffy toy but I assure you, this is no teddy bear.
This creature will kill you.
Most of you, swallow you whole.
You, tiny, you wouldn't stand a chance.
What, you think your buddy's going to help you when you're screaming and a bear's ripping your face off?
No.
You like having arms?
Huh?
Those would be appetizers for this thing.
Yeah.
That's right.
You think I'm joking?
Just look for stuff, Gus.
Like what?
I don't know, man.
Anything that seems suspicious.
Wait a minute, this is something.
What is it?
A copy of an insurance policy.
The trainer's life insurance?
Nope.
The bear's.
And it's worth more dead than alive.
Payout is $2 million.
That would make the trainer a rich man.
No, it would make C. Lee Banting a rich man.
He took out the policy.
That polar bear was our main attraction.
C. Lee Banting?
The zoo director?
So why does the trainer have a copy?
I'm guessing he made himself one because he was suspicious of Banting's intentions.
So you think Banting is our new murderer?
Well, we know the zoo's losing money paw over fist.
That's pretty good motivation to see this poor bear dead.
So what's our next move?
Lunch?
Dad, is there any chance you're coming home for lunch today?
No, sadly, I am not.
Remember when you told me you caught that 40 pound salmon, it would probably take you a year to eat it.
Is there any of that left?
Shawn, why are you suddenly interested in my salmon?
Going to have to call you back.
Shawn.
Jules.
Where's the bear, Shawn?
What would possibly make you believe I have any idea where this bear is?
Oh, um, well, first off, someone called in a tip about a tiny blue car driving an enormous trailer down Mariposa.
Secondly, I am dating you and I know when you're lying.
And third, there are like 300 packets of tartar sauce on the doorstep.
I appreciate your concern.
I'm going to start watching my cholesterol.
Hello, bear.
Hello, polar bear.
Oh, you want some more fish sandwiches?
Oh, my God.
I'm doing this to protect you.
From the bear?
No, it's soft and friendly.
No, from yourself, Shawn.
You are not thinking straight.
You have stolen a bear who is a prime suspect in a murder investigation.
That's just the thing, it's not.
Gus and I are onto several real suspects, human persons that had good reasons for wanting that trainer dead.
Just so you know, if you go to prison, Shawn, I will not wait for you.
You won't have to.
I'll escape.
We both know that.
Before you make that call, will you wait eight more seconds?
Now, Jules, please.
Look at that polar bear.
Look at it right in the eye.
You tell me that it's a murderer.
No.
Nice shot.
I'm here to see my client.
This bear is scheduled to be executed, Shawn.
It's like it's on death row.
Which makes me Susan Sarandon, you, Robert Prosky and the bear, Sean Penn.
Now I'm thinking about the bear playing Harvey Milk.
I would watch that movie.
It'd be a very different film from the original, but I think it would be pretty emotional still.
Where did you even I heard what happened.
I came right away.
So you really do care for this bear, huh?
Please, don't.
Please.
Don't do what you're As a favor?
I'm the cream in a crying sandwich.
I care so much about all these creatures.
I would never risk this bear being put down just to close the zoo.
Hey, man, we may have jumped the gun accusing you of killing the trainer.
Sorry.
That's cool, man.
Actually, no, that's not cool.
That's not cool.
Who would be cool with that?
That's homicide.
Hey, if it makes you feel any better.
We have a new suspect.
Really?
Who is it?
All right, spoiler alert.
C. Lee Banting, zoo director.
Dude, you were totally right about zoos.
The animals spoke to me, man.
A depressed lemur told me about an insurance policy that Banting took out on the bear.
Shawn.
Yeah.
I looked into that.
They only get money if the bear dies accidentally.
They don't get anything if the bear is euthanized for killing someone.
Hmm.
That's a pretty big buzz kill.
It's the only theory we really had.
This is so ironic.
I mean, all these people are afraid of this amazing creature, and look at it, it's relying on you and I to save it, Shawn.
We failed her, Gus.
No.
No.
Take that collar off of her.
If she's going to die, then let her leave this world the way she came in.
Gus.
What?
It's not a regular collar, man.
Look at it.
It's a heart monitor.
See, she's got a slight heart murmur.
They like to monitor her vital signs at all times.
Whoa, where, where, where do these results go?
They're transmitted wirelessly to some nearby computer.
Probably it's right here at the zoo.
I think I know a way to save this bear.
We need to get that info, get to the person who can grant us a stay of execution.
All right, Shawn, this is Cody Blair, Ventura County Director of Animal Control.
Look, you better have something substantial for him.
He's traveled a long way for this.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Blair.
Please, sir, let me start by saying this is a huge honor for me.
Cut the crap, son.
I understand you're asking for a stay of execution, as you put it, for a polar bear?
This is highly unorthodox.
I can assure you, you will not feel that way after I prove to you that this bear did not kill its trainer.
You can enter that onto the record.
Spencer, this isn't a courtroom, there are no records.
Permission to treat this man as a hostile witness?
No.
Quick sidebar?
Absolutely not.
Should we poll the jury?
Negative.
May I try on your robe, Judge?
If you'll excuse me.
Oh, wait, wait, I have testimony from a key witness in the form of video footage if you would just indulge me for a few more moments.
This footage, actually courtesy of Miss Lauren Lassiter.
You're helping him now?
Here we go.
Oh, no, no, I'm absolutely sure, though the results were previously inconclusive, I can now establish time of the death of the trainer to be between Why is this relevant?
I'm so glad that you asked.
I would like to present these papers as exhibit "A".
No exhibits here.
Stop saying that!
What are they?
Those are EKG readouts of the bear's vitals.
What do they say, Mr. Spencer?
I couldn't tell you, sir.
A bunch of squiggly lines to me, but I have an expert witness.
I present Gus J. Gupta.
What makes him an expert?
I work in the medical field.
You're a doctor?
I go to Gus J. For all my medical needs and procedures.
He removed both of my appendixes.
Now, tell us what the results are from the hours of 11:30 p.m. to 3:30 a. M. on the night of the murder.
It is a sleeping heart rate.
Inactive.
What?
Inactive?
You mean, it is not the heart rate of a mammal murdering its lifelong caretaker?
Not unless that mammal was sleepwalking, no.
Well, in that case, the defense rests.
Ooh!
Literally.
I am exhausted.
Should we all nap?
Lauren?
Well, Mr. Spencer, I am inclined to grant you your stay of execution.
Look Now, I'm saying it.
Let's be very clear, if you don't come up with concrete evidence of another suspect within 12 hours, I will proceed with the euthanization of this bear.
Understood.
Sweet.
We did it.
So strong.
So, I come over here to the evidence cage Hello, Franklin.
Hey.
I take out one of these, an E.R. F., Evidence Requisition Form.
Not the blue one, the beige one.
The blue one's for out of state process I'm sorry, cut.
Cut?
You can't say cut.
This is happening now.
This is real life.
Come on.
Let's do it again.
You have to admit this is a bit dry.
Dry?
I'm sorry I didn't realize you were directing me now.
Do you always discount a lead because you didn't come up with it?
What are you talking about?
I mean, look at Shawn and Gus.
Maybe their methods are odd, perhaps even disturbing, but they're not about objects and papers.
They're about people and emotions.
And right now, they are at the trainer's house probably sensing something and you just dismiss it.
There you go.
Okay.
Maybe this is a little drier than you thought it was going to be, and maybe my life isn't as exciting, but I can solve this case.
Everything I need to do it is right here in this box.
The box.
I know what you're looking for.
I know what you need.
I'm going to give it to you.
You need action and you need movement.
Watch this.
I take the box, I go back to my desk where I meticulously go through every piece of evidence we have, every fiber, every fingerprint, every photograph, everything collected from the trash, and then I will find the answer.
If I don't find the answer, I'll look again because the answer is always in the box.
Got it.
Nothing like this ever happens around here.
Not on this block anyway.
There has never been a murder.
I have a question.
When you first moved to the neighborhood, were you harassed a lot on account of being so famous?
What?
Oh, you're not Seth Rogen?
I'm sorry.
Do you know of anyone who might have had it out for him?
Gosh, I didn't know him all that well.
I don't think he had any enemies.
Well, this is a bit of a reach, but did you know he had a fiancée?
Sure, we met her at the crime scene.
Yeah, well, I don't want to speak out of turn or be un-neighborly, but our houses are kind of close together, and I would hear them argue.
Well, who doesn't argue?
Me.
I have a policy.
I never go to bed angry.
It got heated.
How heated?
Pretty heated.
Especially the night of his death.
The cops asked me but I didn't want to make trouble for anyone, so.
It's time to make trouble, sloppy trouble.
I don't know.
It was something like, "When are you going to end it with her"?
"Do you know how much this embarrasses me"?
Stuff like that.
I I think he was having an affair.
Did you ever see the woman come out of the house or I.D. a car?
He loved that bear.
He devoted his whole life to it.
Lauren, I think you should probably get some B-roll.
Okay.
There isn't a single picture of the fiancée in the trainer's house.
Don't you find that a little bit odd?
Mmm-hmm.
He was definitely having an affair, but the woman was very, very large and very, very heavy.
He was a chubby chaser?
What?
Seriously?
The other woman was the polar bear.
Oh.
If the fiancée was jealous of the bear, she knew he was never going to give the bear up for her.
The night "it got heated".
We need to get to that fiancée's house.
Zack and Miri Make a Porno.
Goodbye, Seth.
What do you do when this happens?
Well, the goal is to get buzzed in, right?
So I've been known to use the pizza delivery routine.
Gus has had much more success with Strippergrams.
His stage name is Original G-string, a. K.a. Crowd Pleasah.
You're up, String, do your thing.
Come on, smack it.
I'm not smacking anything, Shawn.
Will you flip it?
Will you stop it?
I don't know, man, you better You better rub it down or something.
You've got an audience.
Well, Lulu, this is what we in the business like to call a collar.
Beat you to it, boys.
Carlton collared her.
I didn't see that coming.
You know a lesser cop might have looked a shredded shirt found in the trash in the trainer's house with traces of blood on it and thought, "No big deal".
The guy probably just cut himself shaving and threw it out.
But I'm not your average cop.
Are you sniffing my sister?
See, I looked at the label on the shirt.
Small.
It wasn't his, it was hers.
I sent it out, had the blood analyzed and lo and behold, direct match to our victim's blood type.
Impressive.
Sure it is.
But what's even more impressive, is getting the confession out of her.
Have you ever seen a murderer crumble?
No, but I have seen many a cookie do that very thing.
After all, it is their way.
You fought with your intended the night of his death, didn't you, Miss Kraemer?
We argued, yes.
I'm going to be honest with you.
I think you killed your fiance Fiance Fia I'm going to be honest with you, I think you murdered your lover.
Lover?
Ooh.
I know.
You don't have to tell me.
I can do it better.
Just start over again.
Let me know when I'm out of frame, okay?
Am I good here?
O'Hara, what are you doing in here?
I'm not sure.
Okay, start again.
Ready and You killed the trainer, then you dragged his body into the car and disposed of it in the polar bear habitat.
Then you hastily returned to that scene of the crime and disposed of that shirt.
But you didn't notice the traces of blood on it, did you?
Well, I did.
What is he trying to do?
Kiss her?
She dragged him?
That small person dragged somebody?
No way.
Uh, question from the viewing room, Miss Kraemer, what is your blood type?
"O" Negative.
And what is the blood type of the victim?
"O" Negative.
Oh, is it?
Lassie, isn't it possible that the blood on Miss Kraemer's shirt is her own?
Okay, you know what, Spencer, I know what you're trying to do.
I am going to send that shirt out, have the DNA analyzed and prove that it was the trainer's blood.
You're making faces at me right now, aren't you?
No need for that.
Miss Kraemer, do you garden by any chance?
I do roses at the house.
That sounds nice.
Would you be so kind as to roll up your right sleeve please?
Ooh, look at that.
Lassie, if you line up the sleeve with Miss Kraemer's arm, I think you will find that the blood spots match perfectly.
Crap.
It's okay, Lassie.
You've got your box of toys in here.
You can try again.
Maybe you want to pin the murder on this stapler here.
Can you just stop?
Now, Lauren, please remember, if anyone ever makes a movie out of your documentary, I would like to be played by Cillian Murphy.
Because it's unexpected.
It's odd.
People will talk.
Obviously, Stoney Jackson will play Gus.
Fyvush Finkel will play my father.
Now, he's probably going to want to do a lisp, but that actually feels right to me.
What are you doing?
I'm erasing all the footage of my brother in the interrogation room.
It's just embarrassing.
What?
No.
Oh, look how adorable Lassie is at that size.
He's tiny.
I just want to pick him up, just pick him up and put him in my breast pocket.
Lassie on your breast.
Right on my breast.
Just keep him right here.
I don't know what happened in there.
This is not the Carlton that I know.
Ever since I was a kid, I always looked up to him, he was like this mythical figure.
But watching him through my lens, and seeing you guys one up him, I realized he isn't mythical at all, is he?
He's just foolish.
Well, I mean, he's not He's not always.
Whoa, whoa, stop right there, Lauren.
Will you excuse us for a second?
Gus, come with me!
I'll be there in a second.
No, no, no, I need you now.
I said I'll be there in a second.
I just had a breakthrough.
Just give me a few minutes.
Are you out of your mind?
Can I have a few seconds alone?
They're out of the same womb.
I don't care!
Just what I thought.
Thank you Hey.
Uh, for being here for me.
You're very kind.
Of course.
Of course.
Wow.
I feel better already.
That's what I'm here for.
You You're a great guy.
Thank you.
Are you dating anyone?
Lauren?
Good news.
Yeah.
I just had a major psychic vibe.
Gather everyone including your brother.
We're going to the real scene of the crime.
Okay.
I'm getting something very strong.
Right here.
Yes, right in here.
Right along here.
This fence was moved.
I'm also getting Judy Sheindlin.
It was a case, small, and then Everything gets fuzzy.
A case, Judge Judy.
I'm sorry.
Line.
Line, please.
What the hell's wrong with him?
It's hard to remember your lines.
Nobody has any lines.
What?
Nobody's on book?
Lauren?
I'm sorry, you guys, this never happens to me.
I swear.
All right, fence, what do we know?
Fence, case.
There was a case, the fence was part of the case.
No one remembers this?
Holy crap.
I know exactly what happened here.
I solved this.
You did?
Yeah, it's all in the evidence.
I'll take it from here, Spencer.
Thanks, Lassie.
I don't Thank you, buddy.
Okay, just Ready?
Say what you will about animals.
They're filthy, they're inferior to man, but the one thing they have over the humans species, animals are not petty.
Humans, on the other hand, oh, we just can't help ourselves.
This whole case came down to a good old fashioned dispute between two neighbors.
A small claims case was filed against Jasper Zane by you, Ritch Renaud.
Psst.
This way.
It was the top document of my neatly stacked box of evidence.
I must have put it there subconsciously.
Let me tell you what happened here, Ritch.
You sued your neighbor over your property line divided by this fence which used to be here.
And you moved it here.
You murdered your neighbor over two feet.
You were at war with each other.
Like Belushi and Aykroyd.
Yes.
In Trading Places.
Neighbors.
I gave it a shot.
Know the feeling.
You argued that night, didn't you?
Things got heated, out of control.
You choked him.
With your opposable thumbs.
Unnecessary detail.
You didn't mean to kill him.
It was an accident.
But suddenly you had to cover it up, so you drove his body to the zoo.
You dumped it in the pit.
And you tried to pin it on the polar bar.
You, sir, disgust me.
And you're the worst neighbor in America.
Detective O'Hara, would you like to do the honors?
Okay.
Uh Oh.
Oh, for god sakes, forget it.
Very impressive, Detective Lassiter.
Please.
Call me Carlton.
I will.
I was just doing a bit.
Yeah, I know what a bit is.
Lassie, thanks for having my back, man.
Oh, hey, no worries.
You would have gotten there eventually.
And I want to give you credit for realizing it's not just about solving crimes.
I mean, these kind of speeches, they require a certain sort of delivery and gravitas that you may just not be capable of.
This is for a movie after all.
He did good, didn't he?
He did okay.
Oh, come on.
He's got his own certain kind of charm.
No, he really doesn't.
I think he found something out there.
I didn't see it.
That's probably because you were busy looking at his sister.
You know, that's right.
What?
You know what?
Um, maybe if you just don't tell me that it's That the camera's on then, then maybe we can do this.
How long have we been friends?
Oh, wow.
Forever.
Since we were babies.
When were we not?
We pooped together.
Well Next to each other.
Shawn will go bald.
It's genetics.
He doesn't realize it now, but it's going to happen.
I just pray that I'm alive to see it.
It's almost like there's a Vulcan, we can finish each other's sentences.
Right.
For example, as soon as we're done here, we're going to jump in the Blueberry and Right.
How can you say I didn't pay any attention to you as a kid?
That's ridiculous.
What other high school boy would stay up reading to their little sister?
Uh, you read me my Miranda rights.
I set it up, as soon as we're done here, we're going to jump That's where you're going to leave off with it.
Scratch this.
Forget that.
It's off?
It's on, isn't it?
I can see the red light.
It's on.
Yeah, I don't know where Gus and I will be in 50 years, but Maybe in space.
If man never figures out how to travel that far.
Man does travel in space.
He's a sweet kid.
I think I'll keep him.

{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Previously on Psych.
Yang is the most notorious killer this city has never seen.
This switch has such a light touch.
And then, boom!
You're going to rot in a cell with four padded walls.
The end.
Mary, you seem disturbed, even more so than usual.
Yang wasn't working alone.
So there really is a Yin to her Yang.
Mary!
I wanted to be heroic.
He was right there!
Shawn, the last time this happened, you put your life on the line, we almost lost your mother.
This guy has never gone up against me.
I will beat him.
Juliet!
He's got her.
If you think I'm sick, you ain't seen nothing yet.
You know this game isn't over.
If I had to choose, I would die execution-style by firing squad.
First of all, nobody's asking you to choose.
And secondly, why that?
It's brutal and violent.
I know.
But I would select all my shooters personally.
George Carlin.
Abbott or Costello, or whoever the fat one was.
Richard Pryor.
Adam Brody.
All the comedy greats.
How funny would that be?
It wouldn't be.
You'd be dead.
Why do you got to take it to a dark place?
Her name is Allison Cowley, she claims to have been abducted by our serial killer, Mr. Yin, and she won't give her statement to anyone but you.
What is that sound?
Oh, I'm sorry, Chief.
Sucking candy?
We have a situation here.
The situation is that Gus and I field six of these Yin calls a month.
Six point eight.
That would insinuate one of them is missing an appendage.
Sucking candy?
No.
These Yin-ites come out of the woodwork looking for some kind of thrill or validation or Closure.
Sickos and whack jobs.
But very sad.
I concur, Lassie.
Suck.
Mr. Spencer, we have an obligation to investigate every claim that comes into this station.
So, get in there.
You know, these Yin-ites are usually women in their late 40s.
You're off-type.
I'll give you that.
And I'm guessing that's your red Jetta out front?
Am I right?
She seems genuinely upset.
I was kidnapped.
I should be dead right now.
Do you have any idea how that feels?
Why do you think this is Yin?
I don't think, I know.
I heard his voice.
He told me I was special.
And then, he shackled me to a pipe.
This was my retainer.
Now, it's just the little piece of wire that saved my life.
I came to you because this is very, very real and very personal.
I don't need to be here anymore, do I?
No.
Okay.
Sure.
And I know it feels very real to you.
But regardless of what you have read or may have heard, I have no personal connection to this psychopath.
All right?
I'm sorry.
Sorry to let you down.
I stole this on my way out.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know You're sure this is the house, right?
Positive.
Stay here.
On my count.
One, two.
Go!
SBPD!
Hands in the air!
Hey!
Hands in the air!
Hands in the air!
Hey!
Hey!
What?
Aw, crap.
Again, we apologize profusely.
And the sergeant behind you will indeed take your statement at this time.
That's not possible.
There were no people.
None of this is right.
I don't know what kind of thrills you were after at the expense of the Santa Barbara Police Department, but you can bet that I will personally be pursuing charges for filing a false police report.
Chief, we jumped the gun, and we do apologize profusely.
Whoa, wait just one profuse second here.
What about the photograph?
If you hadn't had that psychic tizzy fit back at the station, we would have taken the time to have the photograph analyzed.
It looked photo-shopped to me.
Analyze it.
And then, get back to me within seconds of you having anything conclusive.
I'm not crazy.
He brought me here.
I can prove it to you.
Straight ahead is the kitchen.
Go to the left.
There's a fireplace with river rock.
French doors go out to the yard.
To my right, there are stairs going up with a stained-glass window at the base.
Tulips.
Wow.
Really?
Tulips?
They thought that was worth staining into glass?
No.
I would have done something with Kristy Swanson's character from Higher Learning.
Huh?
Maybe her hitting a backhand?
Please believe me.
No.
Shawn, can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah.
One second.
Shawn, I'm a little concerned.
I know.
I know.
I've been wearing these jeans for seven months straight.
I'm going to wash them this weekend.
Stop it.
You still believe this girl?
I don't know for sure.
But shouldn't we give her a chance?
What if she is telling the truth?
Shawn, I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, but this has been a complete waste of our time.
And a little sick, quite frankly.
Why is it so hard for you to imagine?
You, of all people.
Are you afraid to believe her?
Hey.
Allison, where are you staying?
I live in an apartment off campus.
Right.
Well, that doesn't feel too safe.
At least, not until we sort this out.
You know, we know a place where you will be in good hands.
Old, calloused hands, but safe.
So, are you psychic, too?
Uh, no.
No, that's, uh That's Shawn's gift, alone.
Here you go.
Now, sip it.
It's hot.
Thank you.
You guys seem really close.
Yeah.
That's me forcing Shawn to fish.
He hated it.
Photographs can be very deceiving.
The pixel is the smallest addressable screen element.
It's the smallest unit of a picture that can be controlled.
Each pixel has its own address.
Is the picture real?
Parts of it are.
What does that mean?
Well, the background is simply that.
It's changeable.
This image has been laid on top of a fixed pixel array.
It's fake.
Now, we're talking.
Uh, these pixels, however, are rendered from the same set of sub-pixels.
They're undeniably connected.
You were definitely standing next to the woman in the photo.
Oh.
Another hand turkey.
I think that makes six.
Yeah, it's a good thing that Shawn is sharp in other areas because he is artistically challenged.
Oh, come on.
That's not bad for a toddler.
He made that one last Thanksgiving.
I hope the He-Man sheets are acceptable.
Wow.
Seems untouched.
Yeah, I thought about turning the room into some sort of work space.
But in my case, that meant target practice, which didn't seem too practical.
Hey.
Hey, come on.
Come on.
Everything is going to be okay.
You just went through a trauma.
Sometimes, the body has to go into shock before it can start to process this stuff.
I'm not crying about that.
I'm crying because Shawn believes me.
He's the only one.
The family had just returned home from a two-week vacation in Fort Lauderdale.
So?
So, he may have been there the night before.
Your theory is that Yin broke into the house, stole all the furniture, abducted the girl, and then moved it all back in once she escaped?
You sound like Spencer.
Okay, I know it sounds farfetched.
But Yin has done more elaborate things in the past.
Allison Cowley knew the exact layout of this home.
So, maybe she broke into the house herself to learn the layout.
She's a whack job.
Come on, O'Hara.
Look.
I know what it feels like.
Okay?
I have heard his voice.
I have felt his breath, Carlton.
O'Hara I know what you're thinking.
And I don't need to hear it, okay?
If this girl is telling the truth, she needs our help.
My help.
I want pictures of every inch of this room.
With this guy, anything could be a clue.
This cannot happen again.
If this girl dies, we all have blood on our hands.
No, no, no.
There's nothing down there.
I cannot believe I didn't check this room first.
Look, Dad, you followed your instincts, okay?
And they were right.
She should have been safe here.
Son of a bitch was in my house.
He's going to contend with me now.
He's going to contend with all of us.
And I mean all of us.
You really think this will work?
It's certainly worth a shot.
We wouldn't have made it through the last round without her.
What the Hey.
Looks like somebody was a bad girl and raided Mommy's closet.
Hi, boys.
Thank you, Gregory.
Shawn, Shawn, Shawn.
The prodigal son returns.
Are you wearing makeup?
I am.
It's part of my new self-esteem class.
Do you think I look pretty?
That depends.
How far along are you on the class?
Yes, we do.
We think you look lovely.
I've made a lot of progress since the last time we saw each other, Shawn.
They are calling me, "A model prisoner patient".
I'm no longer considered to be a danger to myself or others.
Except for the fat bitch in the cafeteria who can't grasp the concept of a full scoop of mashed potatoes.
We're here to ask for your help again.
You look so much happier, Shawn.
Are you seeing someone?
I don't really think that's any Shawn Spencer has taken a lover.
Yay!
It's about time.
We were worried about you.
Why don't you tell me about this?
Oh, look.
We looked so innocent back then.
Why can't I remember it?
You don't remember it?
Shawn, I'm insulted.
This was our moment.
Where was this photo taken?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You guys have to figure that out for yourselves.
I'm not just going to tell you.
How much fun would that be?
Yin has taken another victim.
Her name is Allison Cowley.
And if you've made all this progress, why don't you prove it to us?
If you want redemption, lead us to Yin and help us save this girl.
Color me intrigued.
Great.
Start talking.
No, Shawn.
That is not the way I work.
You know that.
I'm just like you.
I need to feel and touch and see things with my own eyes.
Take me to the crime scene.
Oh, come on.
That's impossible.
Me hosting The View and making out with Elisabeth Hasselbeck is impossible.
This is not.
It's non-negotiable.
You're going to take me there.
I am going to tell you where I think Yin is, where he's holding the girl, et cetera.
Otherwise, I am late for the afternoon movie.
They're screening Carbon Copy.
I can't resist a young Susan Saint James.
Spunky.
I can't believe this.
Lassie.
Hey.
I need a smallish favor.
Do you remember a shirt that Shawn had as a kid?
It was a sky blue shirt with a dark blue collar?
Henry, what is this about?
Who would remember his shirts from childhood?
I do.
Almost all of them.
I just don't remember this one.
Now, I know he stopped wearing shirts with brand names on them right after his ninth birthday.
Why do you know that?
Because we had an argument about it.
He didn't want to promote products without being paid for it.
Maddie, do you remember the shirt, or don't you?
What's going on, Henry?
You sound like a detective right now.
I am a detective.
Okay, Maddie, I don't want you to be alarmed, but this has to do with Yang.
Did she escape?
No.
No, no, no.
It's nothing like that.
She's safe.
She's behind bars.
It's just this photograph.
This picture.
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
I'm going to handle it all.
Look, if Shawn is in trouble, you better tell me right now because Maddie, I'm going to have to call you back.
Watch your step.
Got it?
Wow.
So, this is where it all began.
Boyhood nights under the covers with a flashlight, making shadows on the ceiling dance.
Counting little lambs while you drifted off to sleep.
Oh, I wish I could go back in time and pinch those chubby little cheeks and tell you that Hey, hey.
Okay.
Nothing will be okay.
Start talking, Yang, or it's back to the rubber room.
What does Lassie think this is, Shutter Island?
That, or Tootsie.
Okay, okay.
Don't get your 1950s boxers in a twist, Carlton.
Come on, Shawn.
Let's do this together.
Hmm.
You must have cared a lot about this girl to let her sleep in your bed.
Does your lover know?
I haven't taken a lover, okay?
Besides, my dad made the sleeping arrangements.
Oh.
And they call me the sick one?
The girl wasn't dragged out of here.
She was lifted out.
Was she drugged?
CSI said they found an alcohol swab.
So, he was gentle with her.
Why?
He told me I was special.
There's something different about this one.
She's special.
Exactly, Shawn.
See how well we work together?
So, maybe he won't kill her.
Oh, no.
He is definitely going to kill her.
He has just got something special planned.
Something fit for a grand finale.
So, where would he have taken her?
Sadly, I have not been in contact with Yin.
Surprise, surprise, he hasn't visited me during my incarceration.
Then, why the hell did we bring you here?
Because Shawn and I have a romantic history together, and I deserve to see his bedroom.
That's it.
This circus is over.
Let's go.
Okay.
Ow!
Gosh.
Fine.
Sometimes, it isn't something he leaves behind.
The clue.
Sometimes, it's something he takes with him.
Shawn?
What?
I've been in this room twice in the last 15 years.
How am I supposed to know if something is missing?
Shawn, think.
Use your gift.
Go back in time and see Sense the way things were.
What does this possibly have to do with Barbra Streisand?
Focus.
One of my army men.
It's facing the wrong direction.
My vinyl.
Meat is Murder by The Smiths.
1984, Van Halen.
Both missing.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
They're clearly in order.
Tears for Fears, Depeche Mode, Thompson Twins.
What order are you using?
Sweetness.
Men Without Hats is sweeter than Echo & the Bunnymen?
But more importantly, where are Devo and the Talking Heads in all this?
All right.
Let's just think about this for a second.
Meat is Murder.
First track, The Headmaster Ritual.
Second track Wait a second.
1984 has Hot for Teacher.
Headmaster.
Teacher.
I live in an apartment off campus.
I am sensing this is about her teacher.
Save Ferris.
Save Ferris.
Thank you.
Awesome.
Great.
All right, this is Allison's class schedule.
Maybe you can Because Shawn and I have a romantic history together, and I deserve to see his bedroom.
Hey.
Simoleun Building.
Lecture Hall C. Where is it?
Are you serious?
Oh.
No, I'm not.
Thanks for your help, man!
If you hit Lecture Hall D, you've gone too far.
Karl Rotmenson, you are wanted for questioning I am not Karl Rotmenson.
I'm just his substitute.
Where is he?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I was just given his lesson to copy on the board.
Let me see some ID.
It's okay.
"A wily prince named Spencerton "attempts to save Lady Allison from the evil clutches of "the handsome but vicious Lord Yin.
" What the hell is this?
Uh, it's an exercise.
A writing essay.
The students can write the details of the story any way they want, but they all have to use the same ending.
What is the ending?
The girl dies.
It's a real downer.
Professor Rotmenson has not shown up for his lectures since last week, so we brought in a sub.
He never called in sick and we never heard from him.
You never noticed anything strange about him?
Any odd behavior?
If you're asking me if he conducted himself like a serial killer, running around with shrunken heads or wearing students' skin as a dress, then no.
We are talking about a highly intelligent man who was either tenured or an adjunct professor at every prestigious institution in California.
We were lucky to get him.
I'd hold off on naming a library after him just yet.
I don't suppose you have an address for him on file?
This is the only address on file.
Thank you.
You've been very unhelpful.
I should have remembered the shirt.
I should have remembered a lot of things.
Look, Maddie, I I got on a plane and I flew here.
And now, I'm standing here in your house.
This is where you make me a pot of your horrendous coffee.
It's going to be a long night.
These are all the photographs I took that summer with my camera.
I've been through everything twice, three times.
I just can't find a match.
Mom.
What are you doing here?
Goose.
Your father called me.
I came here to help.
Dad, why in the hell Shawn, she figured it out.
She's here now, okay?
Let's focus on what's important.
We're going to have to do this together.
Gus.
Juliet.
Detective Lassiter.
Doctor.
All right, fine.
We got an address for Yin.
It was a field.
In the middle of the field was a box.
Inside the box, some VHS tapes.
We don't know what's on them, but we're about to find out.
I can't believe he led us to a cardboard box in the middle of a field.
It's such a blatant rip-off of Se7en.
We got lucky.
It could have been Gwyneth Paltrow's head.
Good thing you still had a VCR, Shawn.
Oh, I've got a laser disc player, too.
Gus still has his Lite-Bright.
Hey, Shawn.
Guster.
So, a lot of this stuff is going to be, you know, just some random thoughts that I'm having.
Um, ideas.
There will be a lot of my personal poetry.
And then, there will be some observations on Yin and Yang.
What the hell is this?
It's his video diaries.
Yin must have stolen them from Mary's apartment when he broke in last year.
He kept them this whole time?
I suspect for this precise moment.
To help us find him.
You're saying he wanted us to find him?
Yeah, I've been thinking.
Why else take someone so close to home?
This feels like an exit strategy.
In other words, if we don't catch him now, we don't catch him.
Then, let's pay attention.
Okay, day one, hour one.
What is the deal with One Tree Hill?
I don't understand.
It's like a poorly executed Dawson's Creek.
Why are they doing that?
Don't even get me started on Chad Michael Murray.
Too late.
I'm going to start in.
He has dead eyes.
Jasper Peaks.
Arrows and bows.
Is he wearing a monkey ascot?
It's a monk-scot.
A tickle of a good friend's nose.
And a tom-tom filled with Spaghettios.
Spencer, why don't we turn this crap off?
There has to be a clue buried in here somewhere for me.
There has to be.
Whoa.
Wait a minute.
It's dated two nights before he was murdered.
No, Marian.
Okay, Shawn.
I might be loopy on too much string cheese right now, but I think I just realized something.
The reason that Yang's book rang false could be 'cause she is a pawn in all of this.
Okay?
She exhibits characteristics that are way more indicative of a victim than an aggressor.
All right?
And we know she didn't do it alone, right?
Maybe she didn't do it at all.
I just think Yin is very, very angry with her for being caught.
Maybe even jealous of the infamy.
Shawn, I think Yin is about to take revenge of the highest malevolence, and I'm worried.
Henry, wait a minute.
What?
What did you find?
Remember that instamatic you bought me for my photography class?
These are the pictures I took.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.
Oh, my God.
It's her.
Whose car is this?
What were you doing there?
I think that CGI has ruined movie storytelling for all of us.
Is he wearing a onesie?
Yes.
I don't want to say it's completely Michael Bay's fault, but that guy needs to be stopped because it's all his fault.
Whoa.
Whoa, that's Allison.
Where is she?
Those stairs seem to indicate a basement somewhere.
I was out looking for Shawn because he was late for dinner.
It started to rain, and I met her.
She asked if she could have her picture taken with him.
And you let her?
She seemed so sad.
She said Shawn was the luckiest, most handsome boy she had ever seen, and that he had kindness in his eyes.
I felt so bad for her.
I never saw her again.
I looked for her that week.
I put the picture in the mailbox.
I never knew she ever got it.
Yeah, well, now we know she did.
Shawn!
Shawn, get down here!
We found it.
Your mom took this photograph.
It's a house.
It's over on Grayson Street.
Grayson Street?
Oh, my God.
That was Yang?
This whole thing started three blocks away.
Come on, Gus!
No, Shawn!
Shawn, get back Shawn, get Damn it, Shawn.
Where the hell is Grayson Street?
Shawn!
Maddie, stay here.
Lock both doors.
Do not leave.
The flag is up.
"Shawn and the salesman, the key is under the mat.
"Wipe your feet.
Come alone or the girl dies".
Shawn We don't have a choice, Gus.
What is this about?
Is this about Shawn?
It's your mom's voice.
Is he okay?
Look, if Shawn is in trouble, There.
you better tell me right now because Henry?
He must have tapped my dad's phone and recorded it.
Henry.
Henry, backup is on the way!
Allison.
Where is it?
It's okay.
We're going to get you out of here.
It's going to be okay.
Shawn, nothing is going to be okay.
Henry, what are you doing?
Henry.
Oh, my God.
I told him that I didn't think you would take the bait, but I guess that's why he's the master.
And I'm the apprentice.
What do you say I give you a tour of the house?
Allison, don't do this.
You have been brainwashed.
Put the gun down.
You can still have a life.
Save it, Pyramus.
You were so easy.
All I've heard is, "He's so worthy.
"My greatest foe.
Blah, blah, blah".
I bust out the pouty lips, the puffy eyes.
You fell for every Neo-Romantic cliché in the book.
Okay.
Come on.
Sit, Ubu.
Sit.
Go on.
Ow.
Ow.
No way in.
This place is like Fort Knox.
Carlton!
This was in the mailbox.
Son of a bitch.
Call for the ram.
That should just about do it.
I'd like to thank Mr. Yin for letting me open up for him tonight.
It's been a blast.
I've got T-shirts and iron-ons for sale in the lobby.
Do you remember the precise moment that you knew that you were a complete psychopath?
Shawn.
No, I'm interested.
Was it gradual, or did you just wake up one morning, look in the mirror, and see the chimp from Monkey Shines?
Miss Cowley, you're excused.
What?
No way am I missing this.
I did everything that you asked me to.
I was perfect.
I deserve this.
I won't ask again.
Well?
First impressions?
Hideous.
Arcane.
I must apologize for the lack of decorum on the part of my new colleague.
Kids, you know, these days.
However, there is no substitute for enthusiasm, and hers is off the charts.
Even I shudder to think what she'll be capable of once I pass off the proverbial baton.
If only your good friend, Yang, had been as passionate.
Oh, well.
No use crying over spilt soda.
Uh What is going inside the syringe?
You should know that two famous the Italian Renaissance, I believe they were from the Este family of Ferrara, met their deaths in those two very chairs.
Really?
No.
I found them at a flea market in Oxnard.
But don't worry, Shawn.
Tonight, we'll be making our own new style of history.
Are you ignoring my question on purpose?
Gus, do you really want to know?
Yes, Shawn.
I'm very particular about what goes into my body.
It's probably safe to assume it's something lethal.
Is that accurate?
A box of MARS bars to you, Shawn.
How much longer are we going to wait?
Henry, it's not my call.
What the hell do you want me to do?
This is wrong.
O'Hara, every fiber of my being tells me this is a bad idea.
It's the only thing we have that Yin hasn't planned for, Chief.
There's a hidden storm cellar.
I can get you into the house on two conditions.
You're in no position to negotiate terms.
What are they?
One.
I go in with you alone.
You need me to navigate.
Anything more, and he's going to know what we're up to.
If he doesn't already.
What's number two?
I get another picture with Shawn.
The other one is just too old.
O'Hara, listen to me.
You don't have to do this.
Yes.
I do.
Stay here, Carlton.
Girl time.
Okay.
This is as far as I go, unless the shackles come off.
Not happening.
That was not part of the deal.
Deals are meant to be broken, aren't they, Juliet?
Shawn has such kind eyes, don't you think?
What are you up to?
You don't trust me?
Of course not.
Well, you should.
I'm the only chance your boyfriend has of getting out of here alive.
Follow me.
Now, to answer your question, Burton, what we have here is a little concoction I affectionately coin The Last Kiss.
One part cyanide, one part strychnine, two parts atropine, with just a shake, not stirred, of boat cleaner.
And it's all for you.
That's not going to work.
I can't watch him die.
You'll have to kill me first.
You must be out of your damn mind if you think I'm going to sit here and die after watching you die with some ridiculous grin on your face because you're thinking about sopapillas, or that stupid scene from Summer School when the students all pretend to be dead.
And do you have just the one needle?
Do you plan on sterilizing in between uses?
Surely, you can't be serious.
I don't know where all you've been, Sean.
Okay, Chief.
Everything is fine.
We are inside the house.
Copy that.
And, Juliet, be careful.
Allison?
Detective O'Hara.
Chief, I have Allison.
She's okay.
I'm going to bring her out.
Allison, are you hurt?
No.
Here, give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
Do you know where the others are?
Can you take me to them?
I don't know where Shawn and Gus are.
He drugged me with something.
I just woke up.
I don't know.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Everything is going to be fine.
Everything is going to be fine.
I'm going to take you out right now.
Don't stop.
Please.
You've got to get me out of here.
You said you just woke up, Allison.
Yeah.
He drugged me or something.
So, how did you know that Shawn and Gus were in this house?
I I don't know what you're talking about.
How did you know?
Not bad for a blonde.
What's going on?
We lost contact.
What?
O'Hara.
All right.
Break down the walls.
Do whatever it takes.
Since when am I an unclean person?
You rode halfway around the world on a motorcycle with a bumper sticker that said "Pucker Up and Blow".
It was a little cartoon tuba.
With human lips.
That's enough.
You two are insufferable.
Don't you even breathe.
Only Burton gets the needle.
I have something far more colorful in mind for you, Shawn.
Firing squad?
Please say firing squad.
I don't blame you, Shawn.
I want you to know that if I had a chance to do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing.
You're my best friend, and we got a chance to live out our childhood dreams.
I don't blame you.
Okay?
And I'm sorry if I couldn't always cut loose the way you wanted me to.
You kill him, I kill you.
You got it?
That race done been run, baby.
No, shouldn't you be launching into some kind of soliloquy?
Huh?
About why you do the things that you do?
And why you picked me?
And all that stuff?
I mean, I think I deserve an explanation here.
You're stalling.
It's beneath you.
No, he isn't.
We'd just appreciate a little closure before we say goodbye to Grover's Corners for the last time.
That's right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is that?
What is that?
A Sesame Street reference?
No, Shawn.
You want to tell us.
You can't help it.
It's called serial killer's prerogative.
You can't resist.
It's protocol.
Very good, Don Cheadle, Jr. Yes, I suppose I didn't lure the two of you all the way over here just to flash you my folksy smile.
I bet you are so textbook.
Overbearing mommy lock you in a closet, huh?
Dissect small animals when you were a little kid?
Memorized episodes of Perfect Strangers line for line?
None of the above, Freud-zoid.
I could have gone either direction, but I chose to indulge the crazies.
I like to defy stereotypes at every turn.
I never jumped on the frozen yogurt train, either.
Why did you pick me in the first place?
Because you were pretty good.
You were interesting.
You had a black sidekick, and that felt fun.
No.
It was more than that.
You've been obsessed with me since I was a kid.
No.
Yang.
Yang was obsessed with you, Shawn.
Yang.
I didn't even know who the hell you were until you started doing this shtick.
Yang took notice of the prepubescent you.
Developed an unhealthy crush.
Feelings are the enemy of efficiency, Shawn.
She betrayed me to save your mother, and that threw a serious wrench into the cogs of my career plans.
She broke my trust, and she broke my heart.
And for that, I blame you.
And now, it's time to die.
Satisfied?
I Hi, Daddy.
Well, well, well, well, well.
Did you read it, Daddy?
Did you read my book?
No, I did not read your book.
I was angry with you.
You guys really dropped the ball, huh?
We got played by the new you.
You replaced me?
Daddy, I'm your own flesh and blood.
I just wanted you to be proud of me.
You betrayed me.
You chose him.
No, no, no.
I just wanted us to be like a real family.
Like the Spencers.
A real family?
You were obsessed with a fairy tale, my dear.
I taught you better.
You're right.
You're right, Daddy.
I'm sorry.
I was sadly mistaken.
No.
No, Yang.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to him.
He doesn't control you.
Not anymore.
Daddy, I just want to come home.
Can I come home now, Daddy?
Yes, my darling girl.
You can come home.
You can come home.
Come to Daddy.
Come home to Daddy.
Give Daddy a big hug.
Yes.
Daddy loves you.
Come here.
Sit on Daddy's lap.
I never loved you.
I know.
Don't move!
Hands up!
You guys all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Allison's crazy, though.
She's in on this.
Yeah.
I learned that the hard way.
I was dead wrong.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
You should see her.
She's going to haunt me in my dreams, Shawn.
And not in a good way.
Well Well, what?
Nothing.
Yang.
You never actually killed anyone, did you?
I could have stopped him.
I was weak.
He raised you.
You never had a chance.
Come on.
Carlton, wait.
A deal's a deal.
Deal?
What deal?
One more.
One more.
Fast.
Let's go.
Goodbye, Shawn.
Goodbye, Gus.
Goodbye, Juliet.
Don't be strangers.
We have badminton every Wednesday.
Oh, I haven't played badminton No, Shawn.
I'll catch up with you later, Mr. Spencer.
Goose.
We're okay.
McNab.
You still here?
There was no way I was leaving here until this thing was over.
This has been a traumatic day.
Year, actually.
Just thinking about all of the Justice?
I was going to say near-death experiences.
You don't feel anything?
Closure.
Indifference.
Hunger.
Wow.
You're like a robot.
Thank you.
Got the same comment on my eHarmony page, so it must be true.
One thing you learn about me right off the bat.
It takes a lot more than a day like today to ruffle this bird's feathers.
Go home to your wife, McNab.
We start back at 9:00 a.m. It's 7:00 right now.
Fine.
Come in an hour late.
Hey.
There you are.
I finished writing my statement 20 minutes ago.
Gus is in the car, engine on, wheels pointed towards pancakes.
Please tell me you're in.
I can't write this.
I thought if I just had a moment to myself, I could.
But it's just living it all over again, and I can't.
All right.
This is what you write.
"We did it".
Maybe add an exclamation point if that doesn't feel too excessive.
I could quite possibly be elated very soon, but part of me feels like we are just marking time until the next crazy rolls in.
Oh, yeah.
Of course we are.
But the next crazy is going to be small potatoes compared to Yin.
Plus, you have me now.
I know I may not appear that physically imposing at first blush, but it turns out I have the tenacity of a Swiss Fox and the instincts of a dragonfly.
You realize one of those is a rabbit and the other is an insect?
That's why I chose them.
But I'm trying to tell you that I would protect you.
And I would protect you right back.
I think you're swell.
I'll see you tonight.
I'll bring you some pancakes.
I don't know if they're going to travel.
They might.
If I get all the stuff on the side.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know I know, you know
