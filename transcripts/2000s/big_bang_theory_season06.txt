{START OF EPISODE 1}
Previously on The Big Bang Theory  We now pronounce you husband and wife!
I love this part!
Me, too!
I have strongly mixed feelings!
So, Howard's really in space, huh?
Mm-hmm, International Space Station.
Right now, Howard's staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god.
Zeusowitz.
I must admit, I can't help but feel a twinge of envy.
He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes.
His dim, uncomprehending eyes.
It's like a cat in an airport carrying case.
You know, it's not exactly glamorous up there.
The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other's recycled urine.
Must be nice.
Nobody wants anything that comes out of me.
: I wonder what he's doing right this very second.
Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity.
Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.
Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same.
MRS.
Howard!
Can you hear me?
!
I can hear you without the phone!
Don't be snippy.
I'm just excited to talk to my baby!
I'm excited to talk to you, too.
So, what's this mishegas about you moving out to go live with the little Polish girl?
!
How about calling her my wife?
Wives don't take boys from their mothers.
They do.
That's why we marry them!
I just hope I'm not dead from a broken heart before you get back.
Ma, please.
Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call.
Good.
They should know what a horrible son you are!
Okay, Ma, great talking to you!
Gotta go!
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
This is so exciting.
Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend.
Hey, this is my natural hair color.
Now.
So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?
Oh, yes.
According to the Relationship Agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.
That's hot.
You kids better use protection.
How long does this stay on?
Just a couple of minutes.
You've really never done this before?
Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.
Oh, my gosh, that's awful.
The other kids make fun of you?
No, I had a cover story; I told everyone it was herpes.
So, how's everything going with you and Leonard?
: I don't know, it's still kind of weird.
We haven't really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.
Oh.
Boo-hoo.
If Sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go.
Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
Interesting question.
On the one hand, I always thought You don't even know what it is, do you?
The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question.
As I am doing so eloquently right now.
I know what the anthropic principle is.
Of course.
I just explained it to you.
Now, where do you stand on it?
Where do you stand on it?
Strongly pro.
Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh, he made you to annoy me.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
I'm all for it.
Attaboy!
Well, hang on.
Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don't?
Oh, Leonard.
Let's not take a saw to the branch we're sitting on, shall we?
Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet in a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them.
I don't need to tell you, in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.
Actually, I'm hanging out with Penny.
Oh, okay.
Sounds like it's me and you, Sheldon.
How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?
As I've stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are: "Release the Kraken".
That never gets old.
"Release the Kraken"!
Oh, chills.
Besides, I'm having dinner with Amy.
Oh, okay.
I'll just go home and be alone.
W-Which is cool.
I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so Cool.
Darn.
If you weren't busy, I'd ask you to join us.
Really?
I can come?
Thanks!
Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?
Oh, absolutely.
I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can't outsource that to an Indian.
Howie?
Howie?
Hey, there's my beautiful bride!
Can you see me?
I can.
How are you?
: I'm amazing.
I mean, this is even better than I dreamed.
I look out the window, and it's all so unbelievable.
Good for you.
I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.
Oh, yeah?
That's nice.
It was.
Until I found out you never told her we're not gonna live with her.
Let's talk about that for a minute.
Hey, look, this pen is floating.
How crazy is that?
You said you told her, but you never did!
Okay, okay, I know you're upset, but let me share something I've learned since I got here.
You realize how small your problems are when you're looking down on them from space.
Now, come on, that's got to make you feel better.
How clear is the image of me on that screen?
Pretty clear.
Do I look like I feel better?
I mean, it's not, like, HD quality.
Listen, mister, you're gonna talk to your mother and you're gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself.
: Like he's been doing since he got here.
Sheldon, this place is so romantic.
Oh, I'm glad you like it.
Raj picked it out.
Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.
Tell him yourself.
Yoo-hoo!
Over here!
I don't understand.
What's he doing here?
I invited him.
On our date?
Sheldon, that's not okay.
Yes, it is.
There's a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.
You found a loophole?
Sorry I started without you.
I'm a little nervous.
It's been a long time since I've been on a date.
I can't believe I bleached my mustache for this.
You should go to my girl.
She'll knock out those sideburns for free.
You know, Amy, I don't even think you and I have had a real conversation.
Let's use tonight to get to know each other a little better.
You start.
Go home.
I don't understand.
Sheldon, how could you do this?
It's our second anniversary.
It's your anniversary?
!
Oh, my God, I had no idea.
Amy, please, let me make this right.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
Waiter?
A bottle of champagne and three glasses.
Oh, boy, isn't this romantic?
Oh, I hope that's a rhetorical question, because I have no clue.
This is great.
What's the occasion?
No occasion.
You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.
That is so sweet.
I got all your favorites.
Beer, wings, sliders.
We can watch the football game.
I even painted my stomach.
"Go sports"?
Well in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didn't want to look ridiculous.
This is awesome.
I love it!
Good, I'm glad.
Gosh, I worked my ass off today.
This is exactly what I needed.
Great.
Just relax and enjoy.
Tonight is all about you.
Ah, thank you!
So, where exactly are we in this relationship?
Oh, come on!
I just told you I had a hard day.
You're right, I'm sorry.
Let's watch the game.
Great.
I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.
Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?
Absolutely.
You're the girl, I'm the guy.
Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.
Thank you!
Oh, I'll get it.
Go sports!
Hello-lo-lo.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.
I was, but it's their anniversary and I didn't want to be a third wheel, so I figured I'd come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.
Well, it's not really a great time.
Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.
No, we don't!
Come on in!
Sweet!
: I can't believe I shaved my stomach for this.
Hey, Froot Loops.
You got a phone call.
Who is it?
A woman who says she's your mother but sounds like your father.
Hey, Ma.
You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.
I'm not going near that fakakta thing.
I'll catch a computer virus!
You can't catch a computer virus.
Oh, so now you're an astronaut and a doctor?
: What do you want, Ma?
Your wife says you have something important to tell me.
Okay, here it is.
Bernadette and I are starting a life together and Oh, God!
You are gonna leave me!
Ma It's okay.
Your father left me, you left me-- I guess I'm just the kind of person people like to leave.
It's not definite.
I'll talk to Bernadette.
Don't bother.
I'll just go sit in a hole in the ground so I'm no trouble when I die.
Stop it, Ma.
I'm sure I can get Bernie to come around.
I knew it!
I knew she was behind this!
You listen to me, if you want to be a man, you can't let a woman tell you what to do!
Okay, okay.
I can't believe these people won the Cold War.
Now, can we please change the subject?
Fine.
Explain why you've been gone so long and I haven't gotten a single letter.
Not even a lousy postcard!
You know, I'm growing to like American football.
Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?
Well it's not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey what is?
All right, who's ready for another beer?
I'm good.
No, thank you.
Girls.
: I am having the nicest time.
You guys are like family to me.
You know that, right?
That's great.
Get out.
What?
Why?
Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.
Oh pish on your issues!
You guys are fine.
Yes, you hit some bumps along the way.
I mean, Penny, you've always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.
Okay, hold on Now, don't blame yourself.
He was a groveler from way back.
But the point is, the two of you got past it.
And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex?
That was some weak tea, dude.
Some people might say it was romantic.
Yeah, no.
But yet, here you two are, still together.
And that's even after you and I had our crazy naked night.
Okay That's enough.
I'm just saying that after everything you've been through, you get to look into each other's eyes and say "I love you".
And that's beautiful.
Actually, to this day, she's never really said it.
Oh, Penny!
That's ridiculous!
You know you love him!
You look him in the eyes and you say it.
Raj Oh, come on, you know you want to say it.
Say it.
Say you love him.
Say it!
I really thought she would say it.
Have I ever told you you're like a sexy praying mantis?
Every time you drink alcohol.
You know what's wonderful about the praying mantis?
They devour their mate.
Your point being?
Dessert is served.
I just had cobbler.
You know what?
I'm done with this.
W-Where are you going?
I'm leaving.
You can't leave.
I need you.
You do?
Yes.
You're my ride.
Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done.
All right.
Please.
Amy when I look in your eyes and you're looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time.
I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified.
The truth is, I don't know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be.
Sheldon that was beautiful.
I should hope so.
That's from the first Spider-Man movie.
I'll take it.
Good.
Now, I assume we're splitting the check?
Hey, Stuart.
Oh, hey.
I was actually just about to close up.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll leave.
No, no.
It's okay.
Hang out.
You sure?
Yeah, you're my first customer today.
All right.
Great.
I'm, uh, having a nightcap.
You want to join me?
What are you drinking?
Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug.
I call it a sad-tini.
Perfect for the night I'm having.
Thank you.
Hmm.
Nice not to drink alone.
Amen to that.
Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog's water bowl.
You're kidding.
She's kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?
Cheers.
Cheers.
A little music?
Sure.
Mmm.
Bossa nova.
You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.
Mmm.
Oh.
Something about Latin music just makes me feel like I'm on a white sand beach in Rio.
Yeah.
The sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies, tanned and glistening with sweat.
I should go.
Yeah.
Uh, thank you for the drink.
No problem.
Hey, Stuart.
Yeah?
Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?
Yeah, I-I'd like to, but I'm a little tight on funds.
No problem.
My treat.
I'll swing by after work.
Okay.
Okay.
I could do worse.
Aw, that's such good news, Howie.
Thank you for telling her.
Hey, I'm a grown man; I'm gonna live with my wife.
My mother's just gonna have to learn to make do on her own.
Was she upset?
Who can tell?
She yells everything.
She might have been upset.
She might have been hungry.
Thanks for fixing it.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Sweet dreams.
I'll talk to you tomorrow?
Good night, Rocket Man.
To infinity and beyond, baby.
Loops.
You realize you just lied your ass off to your wife and your mother.
I know.
What are you gonna do when you get back to Earth?
Oh, I'm never going back.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
And the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.
Ooh, one gravy boat.
That's from Sheldon.
He told me he had it engraved.
"In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper".
One "inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that" gravy boat.
When I get married I'm going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.
Ew, why?
'Cause I've always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.
So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?
Not just someday.
In exactly four years.
But don't tell Sheldon.
He's still a flight risk.
What about you, Penny?
What about me what?
Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?
Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.
But do you think you'll ever get married?
He's a sweetie.
You're not answering the question.
Do you love him?
Yeah, sure, of course I love him.
It doesn't sound like it.
Well, I do.
Do you tell him that?
No, he'd just take it the wrong way.
What does that mean?
It means he is special and smart and nice and Are you gonna break up with him?
No!
Maybe.
I don't know.
I had no idea you were unhappy.
That's the thing: I'm not.
I'm not unhappy at all.
It's just I don't know Do you ever feel that way about Howard?
Oh, that's not really a fair comparison.
I'm basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.
Amy, you?
Can't help ya, kid.
Whenever I'm around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire.
In the good way.
Not the urinary tract infection way.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
Hey, buddy, how's it going up there?
You don't have to shout, Raj.
It's not like I'm an astronaut floating around in outer space.
Oh, wait, I am.
So, is it everything you hoped it would be?
It's better.
I wake up every morning and I just can't believe I'm on this incredible adventure.
Hey, Froot Loops, did you clean the space toilet?
Excuse me.
I'm talking to my friends.
You know the rules: new guy scrubs the toilet.
If you do good job, next time we give you brush.
Funny.
We're always giving each other a hard time up here.
It's kind of like being in a frat.
You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.
Okay, my turn.
Let me talk to him.
Go ahead.
Pasadena, California to International Space Station.
Can you read me?
Over.
Yes, I read you, Sheldon.
Copy that.
Over.
What are you doing?
I am talking to a man in space.
If you don't have the then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.
You're out of your mind, Sheldon.
That's a negative.
My mother had me tested.
Over.
Come on, scrub it up, Loops.
All right, all right.
I gotta go.
There's a meteor shower.
You want to see a meteor shower?
Take a look at what Dimitri just left you in the toilet.
Bye.
Over and out.
Bye, buddy!
Hello.
Hey, Stuart, come on in.
What are you doing here?
Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.
Excuse me.
I didn't authorize this.
Sheldon, you are not in charge.
That's mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.
What's the big deal?
You guys are bringing your girlfriends.
I didn't want to sit by myself.
The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five.
Now, we're going to be a faceless mass of six.
It'll be fine.
Just, uh, pretend he's Wolowitz.
Hmm.
Do you like Raisinets?
I can take them or leave them.
At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.
Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?
Well, it's hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn't crunch during the film and it's Raisinets.
Okay.
Should we go?
Yeah, but, one more question.
If you're going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.
All right.
Wolowitz went to MIT.
What's your educational background?
I went to art school.
Equally ridiculous.
Let's go.
This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.
Well, I like it.
Yeah, of course you do.
You're a girl.
You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.
Just watch the movie.
It's not fair.
Penny isn't making Leonard hold hands.
There might be a reason for that.
Sweaty?
Unhygienic?
Looks dumb?
Take your pick.
Penny said she's not sure she wants to be Leonard's girlfriend anymore.
Wrong.
She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.
So?
So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches' brew of his soda and spit?
It's complicated.
String theory is complicated.
That's just yucky.
Don't get any ideas.
All right, for the sake of argument, let's say that's true.
Why doesn't Penny just end the relationship?
She's not sure how she feels.
How can she not be sure how she feels?
You know, when I have a feeling, I know it.
Trains?
Love them.
Swordfish?
I love them, too.
They're fish with a sword for a nose.
Regardless, don't say anything to Leonard.
Now you're asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?
Yes, please, Penny will kill me.
Fine.
secret-keeping?
Hate it.
Hand-holding?
Not a fan.
Hammerhead shark?
I love that thing.
Yeah, it's another fish with a tool on its head.
Raisinet?
Shh, we're trying to watch the movie.
This is not working out with him.
What are you doing?
I think I might have tartar buildup.
My tongue won't go as far forward as it used to.
Maybe your tongue is shrinking.
Nope.
Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.
I'm starting to get a sense of it.
Don't worry.
I'll take you to the dentist tomorrow.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
You're good people, Leonard.
There's something I need to tell you.
Okay.
I can't tell you.
Why?
I can't tell you why I can't tell you.
So I guess there's two things I can't tell you.
I wish there were more.
Good night.
I'm sorry.
This is really important.
What is it?
I like The Transformers.
Do you like The Transformers?
Where exactly did your mother have you tested?
Leonard, The Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be.
You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to.
Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room.
I'm going to pause to let that sink in.
Okay, I think I understand.
You do?
The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.
That is literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Leonard?
Leonard.
Leonard?
What?
Are you sleeping?
I was.
Now I'm having a nightmare.
What do you want?
Never mind.
I still can't tell you.
Penny?
Mmm.
Penny.
Mm-hmm, mmm.
Penny.
Oh, my God.
Sheldon?
You frightened me.
What are you doing in my bedroom?
Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn't hear it.
How did you even get in, you weirdo?
Yeah, really?
I've seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it's weird?
What do you want, Sheldon?
Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you're up, we could talk.
Talk about what?
Oh, I don't know.
Uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with.
Why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend.
Yeah, pick one-- your choice.
Sheldon.
Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that?
Hubba-hubba.
Okay, go home, crazy man.
Yeah.
Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today's North Korea, he's downright average.
Talk about a keeper.
Okay, what did Amy tell you?
Oh, very well.
I can't keep up this clever charade any longer.
She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.
Okay, you listen to me.
I think it's really sweet you're trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business.
Got it?
Excuse me.
This is not about protecting my friend.
I'm a big fan of homeostasis.
Do you know what that is?
Of course not.
Yeah.
Homeostasis refers to a system's ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.
Worst bedtime story ever.
My point is I don't like when things change.
So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard.
And also, while we're on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo.
I'm not comfortable with the new scent.
Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.
Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard.
Do you understand?
I do.
You clear on the shampoo issue?
Get out.
Penny?
What?
Please don't hurt my friend.
That is the last thing I want to do.
Thank you.
Coconut?
What were you thinking?
Are you a hula girl?
Get out!
Hello?
What the hell is wrong with you?
You told Sheldon?
Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in?
Hang on, please.
Hello?
Yeah, just a heads-up: Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard.
She's pretty mad.
I know.
She's yelling at me right now.
All right then, so we're all on the same page.
Yeah.
Hey, Bernie.
There's my hubby.
How's everything going up there?
Oh, it's okay.
Space is beautiful.
Earth is beautiful.
Same old, same old.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Everything's fine.
Howard.
The other astronauts are being mean to me.
No, what are they doing?
Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window.
When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.
Oh, Howie.
You can see it if you want.
It's on YouTube.
Google "astronaut screams for nine minutes".
Why don't you stand up to them?
What am I supposed to say?
I don't know.
Say, "Being mean is lame.
What's cool is being nice".
Great, I'll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.
Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?
No.
My mom already tried that.
It only made things worse.
Gelatinous Sphere.
Focused Locust.
Temple of Yip.
I'm sorry.
Wolowitz would never play that card.
All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.
Fairy God Monster, I win.
Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.
So, what are you guys doing later?
Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.
We're gonna try to meet some girls.
'Cause that's what we do.
Watch out, ladies: a little coffee and cream coming your way.
In case you didn't follow that, I'm the coffee.
Leonard?
Maybe you'd like to go with them to meet girls.
Why would I be interested?
I have Penny.
Yeah, for now.
But that woman has a death wish, Leonard.
She talks to strangers; she pets unfamiliar dogs; and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment.
If I were you, I'd get a back-up.
You can't just replace someone you care about with some other random person.
No, please don't ruin this for me.
Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?
Yes, you walked around for a week saying, "Sheldon unhappy with casting choice".
But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.
What's your point?
Call me a romantic.
I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.
This is ridiculous.
Are we gonna play cards or not?
I like Mark Ruffalo, too.
Yeah, settle down there, Fake Wolowitz.
No one likes a kiss-up.
So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.
Really?
Yup.
I told him if he didn't bite the hygienist, I'd take him for ice cream.
Mmm.
I didn't have to take him for ice cream.
Uh-huh.
You okay?
You seem a little distracted.
Look, there's something I need to tell you.
Oh.
Yeah, okay.
I don't really know how to say this.
Just say it.
Okay.
Here goes.
Mm-hmm.
You slept with him?
I didn't know what else to do.
He had those big, sad eyes.
Oh, sure, you had no choice.
He looked at me like this.
Well, if that's all it takes, it's a good thing you don't have a dog.
Don't worry.
You'll have plenty of chances to break up with him: Your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary.
Look, it's fine.
We're not getting married, okay?
We're keeping things, you know, homeostasis.
It's so cute when she tries.
It's from Leonard.
"Last night was amazing.
"You're amazing.
I'm so lucky to have you in my life".
Please, stop it.
Hey, Bernie, guess what?
I stood up to the other astronauts like you said and I got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week I got a good night's sleep.
Oh, Howie.
What's wrong?
You look upset.
Nope, this is my proud face.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hey, Bernie.
Hey, how's my little astronautie hottie?
Okay, I guess.
It's just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.
Well, hang in there.
You just have a couple more days to go, and then you'll be home.
I know.
I got to get back to work.
I love you.
Love you too.
Hey, Bernie?
Before you go, can you do something for me?
What do you want me to do?
Okay, here it is.
I really miss gravity.
Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?
Really, you're serious?
Okay.
Oh, baby, you're killing me.
Ugh.
Hey, Sheldon?
Hi.
This came for you today.
It's from your mom.
Oh!
Thank you, Penny.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, w here.
For your troubles.
Oh, boy, a whole dollar.
Now, I can quit my paper route.
So, what's in it?
Mmm, doesn't matter.
Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.
Yeah, it's journals and research papers I wrote as a child.
Aw, how cute.
Is this like a diary?
No, that's my potty training journal.
Really, your potty training journal?
Yeah.
And forgive my crude penmanship.
I didn't start typing until I was six.
"August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating.
What was wrong with diapers"?
There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, color and consistency.
Oh!
Disgusting.
No, what's disgusting is he's still keeping track.
Why do you need all this stuff?
No, no, no, no Sorry!
I am glad you asked.
Oh!
Yeah, are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
Of course, it is it's been in the news.
And it's a very famous boson.
Nice try.
Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson.
Now, initially, the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right.
And now he's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.
Yeah, that's basically what I said.
Yeah The point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I've already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.
I didn't know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.
You really think there's some kind of scientific discovery in here?
Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school.
There's a good deal more to come.
I didn't really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as "playing outdoors".
So, you're going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?
That's a good point.
My time is much too valuable.
You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me.
You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labor.
Not gonna happen.
Yeah, well, if I didn't think you could handle it, I wouldn't be asking.
If you want help, just hire a grad student.
Maybe I could do it.
You, really?
You can assess the quality of my work?
Okay, um, here.
I wrote this when I was five years old.
"A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non-self contradictory set of abelian groups".
I'm just a blonde monkey to you, aren't I?
You said it, not me.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
All right, Ms. Jenson.
Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment?
Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?
No, thanks.
I'm fine.
Now, are you sure?
Everyone's smoking them.
I think they're the best.
I don't do drugs.
Excellent, yeah.
That was a ruse.
They're not the best.
Physics is the best.
And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice.
All right, so I see here you're from Des Moines, Iowa.
Uh, you're summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University.
Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection.
I hope that didn't cause any hearing loss.
No, of course not.
How did you know about that?
I did a comprehensive background check.
Medical records, credit reports, criminal history.
: I trust you paid off those parking tickets.
Yes, I did.
Hearing unimpaired, good.
Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position.
It would be an incredible honor to work for a man of your brilliance.
Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.
It's not flattery if it's the truth.
Oh, well, thank you.
Welcome aboard.
You talk to Howard lately?
Uh, yeah, last night.
He kept making me drop pencils for him.
I got uncomfortable.
Hey, Sheldon, hope you're hungry.
They're serving macaroni and : cheese.
: Smooth.
Hi.
Hello.
Sheldon, aren't you going to introduce us?
No.
I have people for that now.
You're up.
I'm Alex, Dr. Cooper's new assistant.
Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul.
I'm Leonard.
This is Raj.
It's nice to meet you.
I'm so excited to be working with Dr Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson.
Yeah, FYI, there will be no breaks.
I should probably get to work.
She seems nice.
Hey, you already got a girlfriend.
I call dibs.
All I said was, "She seems nice".
Yeah, well, I love her.
Hey, I wasn't expecting to hear from you today.
Everything okay?
Uh, no, not really.
What's wrong?
Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?
Uh-huh.
It's delayed.
We're gonna be here at least another week.
Maybe ten days.
It's the Russians, so you don't know.
They left dogs up here in the '60s.
Come on, Howard.
No one's leaving you up there.
I don't know how much longer I can take this.
I can't sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux.
I'm down to my last three Tums.
You're going to be fine.
You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom.
And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two.
Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.
Okay, okay.
What am I doing?
I'm using up all the oxygen.
If I die, promise you'll never have sex with another man.
Oh, yeah.
I'm a man-eater now.
Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler.
You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.
Oh, I don't know.
Looks like something used by Tinker Bell's gynecologist.
Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so Who are you calling?
I'm going to video-chat Sheldon.
Mmm.
If my new look leads to phone sex, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the room.
Dr. Cooper's office.
Oh, hello.
Who are you?
I'm Alex, Dr. Cooper's assistant.
Can I help you?
I'd like to speak to Sheldon.
I'm sorry.
He's asked me to hold all calls unless you're Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.
All right.
Well, tell him Amy called.
Last name?
He knows my last name.
I'm his girlfriend.
We have a contract and everything.
I'll send you a PDF.
All right, I will tell him you called.
Hmm, that's weird.
What?
Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex.
He didn't mention that Alex was a girl.
Maybe he didn't notice.
You're right.
I don't have to worry about Sheldon.
: No, you do not.
It's her I have to worry about.
Oh, Amy, really?
She is not going to come on to Sheldon.
Oh, really?
Look at this face.
How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?
Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.
Amy, this is crazy.
You have nothing to be suspicious about.
I'm not suspicious.
I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant.
Aha!
Can we go now?
Hang on.
What are you doing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm spreading my scent to mark my territory.
Come on, Amy.
That is not gonna work.
Really?
Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.
Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?
In fact, she has.
Uh, her exact words were, "What is that guy's problem"?
I'm in her head.
Let the dance begin.
Here's your frozen yogurt, Dr. Cooper.
This should be fun.
Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?
Yes.
Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?
Rainbow, not chocolate.
Two cherries?
One on top, one on the bottom.
Stems removed?
Um top one, yes.
I didn't check the one on the bottom.
Oh!
I'm so sorry, Dr. Cooper.
It's all right, Alex.
I'm not mad at you; I'm just disappointed.
Wait, Alex.
Do you want to join us?
Um Uh, Alex, a moment.
I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter.
Do you think it's appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?
Given her what?
If I've learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it's that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.
What?
It's a kindness, Leonard.
Otherwise, you're cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that's just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.
Oh, sure.
Please join us.
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
So, Alex, what's the topic of your dissertation?
I'm looking for Trojan asteroids at Earth's L-Five Lagrange point.
Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali's field of expertise.
You two have a lot to talk about.
Is that true?
Is he all right?
No.
But compared to your boss, he's the poster boy for sanity.
It's okay, I've been around scientists all my life.
My dad's an astronomer at SETI.
Oh, SETI-- the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
You should introduce him to Sheldon.
The search is over.
So, what kind of research are you doing?
High-energy lasers.
Ooh.
Military?
Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.
You were right.
I had nothing to worry about.
That skank's your problem, not mine.
You're very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.
Thank you.
Aah!
Cherry stem!
Cherry stem!
How you doing, Howie?
You feeling a little better?
Oh, a lot better, thanks.
One sec.
Listen close.
I don't have a lot of time.
I need you to go to my house.
In my bedroom, you'll find a model rocket.
I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.
Okay Step two: Build a version roughly 14 stories high.
Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me.
: I'll leave the door unlocked.
Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you're having a little anxiety.
No, no, I'm fine.
No anxiety!
: We should probably talk in code.
From now on, "frog" is me, "sandwich" means you and "lemon" means rocket.
So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon 'cause froggy wants to come home!
Look at you, putting on a brave face.
There's nothing to be brave about.
Everything's fine.
Really?
I don't know how much you know about primate behavior, but Sheldon's assistant was clearly courting Leonard.
Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly colored hindquarters like a big red welcome mat.
By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.
Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares?
Look, I don't even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.
So says your prefrontal cortex.
But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he's desirable.
Well, of course he's desirable.
I mean, he's great.
He's smart, he's sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.
So it does bother you.
Fine, it bothers me a little.
No.
You know what?
This is stupid.
It doesn't bother me.
Okay, it bothers me.
But only because she wouldn't stop laughing.
Leonard is not that funny.
And there you have it; prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust.
If this were a boxing match, they might call it "The thrilla adjacent to the amygdala".
If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now!
So, how was work today?
Ah, it was all right, I guess.
Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon.
Caught Raj right in the eye.
Oh!
You're kidding.
No, Raj had to go to the nurse.
Wow.
Anything else?
Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn't talk to her.
She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.
Is that it?
Isn't that enough?
It had the weaponized fruit and a puppet.
What more do you want?
Oh, good, Leonard, you're here.
Science news.
This will interest you.
And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.
What do you got?
I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize.
Behold.
"Magnets: What Do They Stick To"?
If the answer is "metal," it's not exactly groundbreaking.
The original title was "A Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations Regarding Electromagnetism"" I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.
Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.
Oh, it's about time.
I hated the old way.
Hi.
I'm Penny.
Alex.
Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?
In a way.
We've kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.
Oh.
Well, you're lucky.
He seems very talented.
And I'm sure a lot of people want to work with him.
Well, a lot of people can't.
Uh, hey.
Where are we going?
My limbic system wants to take your pants off.
She seems nice.
Notice people on your own time.
We're working.
Hey, Howie, how you feeling?
Better.
Much better.
The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot.
Oh Attention, people of Earth: Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky.
Howie, stop that.
NASA's watching this!
Put your pants back on!
Whee!
Whee!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Howard's capsule should be reentering the atmosphere any minute.
It'll be good to have him back.
The Fantastic Four reunited!
Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz.
We'll remember you with nostalgic fondness.
The way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or or Leonard's gym membership.
We're not kicking him out.
Stuart and I have become good friends.
Okay, one vote for, one vote against.
Leonard, you're the tiebreaker.
I don't have a problem with Stuart.
Besides, he gives us a 20% discount at his comic book store.
Well, I don't sell my friendship that cheaply.
I can go 30.
Welcome aboard, old chum.
Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard's final descent has begun.
He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.
Loops, calm down!
Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu Melech haolam, hamotzi Lechem min haaretz What's that?
The Jewish prayer for eating bread!
: We don't have one for falling out of space!
We did it!
: We're on the ground!
We survived!
That was just the parachute.
We still have another six miles to go.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
Waiting for my husband.
That's nice.
He's coming back from outer space.
I think this flight's coming from Houston.
No, I mean, he Never mind.
There he is!
Howie!
Howie!
Whoa, thank you.
Great to be back on Earth.
Uh, I think they're here for me, Ringo.
Howie!
Howie!
Mr. Mandel, I'm your driver.
Oh, thanks.
Here you go.
That nut job was telling everybody on the plane he's an astronaut.
I missed you so much!
I missed you, too.
Oh Where are the guys?
Oh, it's just me.
Oh, I get it.
They're waiting back home with a big surprise party.
Don't worry, I can act surprised.
No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night.
Tonight, you belong to me.
Gesundheit.
You okay?
I am now that you're back.
Come on, let's go home so I can tear off those little pants.
Great.
Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.
You know, I am very disappointed that I won't be able to celebrate Howard's accomplishment tonight.
Me, too.
But we'll see him tomorrow.
Yes, it's just that in all the years I've known him, he's never had the opportunity to receive my admiration.
I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.
You're unbelievable.
I know.
All right, Pictionary-- what are the teams?
How about boys versus girls?
Oh!
That hardly seems fair.
But I guess any team that I'm not on has a decided disadvantage.
Once again, unbelievable.
Yeah, once again, I know.
All right, round one.
Here.
Got it.
Okay.
Ready, set, go.
Uh, box?
Uh, window?
Batman.
Batman and Robin.
Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey.
Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.
A gift?
Present!
Present!
Yeah!
Oh Leonard.
Now, how can you not get that?
In what universe is that a present?
It's not a present, it's the present.
Look.
There's you and me.
It's Penny and Amy.
We're playing Pictionary.
In the present.
Oh, my God, we're gonna kill them.
It's a quark-gluon plasma.
No.
It's asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.
Nothing with quarks.
It's an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe!
No!
It's a chocolate chip cookie!
Yes!
How could you miss that?
Hey, if you want someone to guess "chocolate chip cookie," you draw a glass of milk next to it.
Penny got it.
Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers.
You're welcome.
Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst?
Oh, oh, a hot dog.
Penny, aren't you gonna draw something?
: Relax, we got time, this is so fun.
There.
A solar system.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst?
I don't Now?
Soon.
Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.
I don't know, uh Casper the alcoholic ghost?
All right, that's enough.
Uh, hand.
Uh, nail polish?
Yep!
Wait, no, no!
No!
The word is "Polish".
See, look.
Polish sausage.
And the-the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer.
And then, finally, if that wasn't enough-- which it should've been-- this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth!
Excuse me, the word is "polish".
See?
Small "P".
Ah!
So it is.
I guess we both share blame on this one.
Bernie, you okay?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?
It's just allergies.
Okay.
: Took some Benadryl.
I'll be fine.
So did you miss me?
Oh.
Are you kidding?
Every minute of every   Ew.
Excuse me.
Sweetie, we don't have to do this now.
Yes, we do.
You left right after we got married.
This is like our honeymoon.
Now, hold on to your hat.
Oh.
Uh-oh.
You okay?
A little dizzy.
Must be the Benadryl.
Switch places with me.
Okay.
Now kiss me!
Bernadette?
Bernie?
Bernie?
That was amazing.
You made me feel things I never Well, that was quick and a little gross.
Now, I know how she feels.
Hey, Sheldon, you're always full of fun little facts.
Where did the expression "got your ass handed to you" come from?
Don't know.
I wonder if it's from, like, ancient Rome where they'd actually chop somebody's ass off and then go, "Here".
You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.
I am not a loser.
Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.
Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills.
It's a pretty well-rounded game.
Lot of big talk from a man who can't draw a chocolate chip cookie.
All right, fine, pick another game.
Amy and I will beat you at anything.
All right.
Let's play Physics Fiesta.
Oh, come on, what is that?
It's a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish.
Um Â¿DÃ³nde estÃ¡ el boson de Higgs?
En el acelerador de particulares.
Bueno, mi amigo.
No, no, we're not playing some dumb made-up game.
All games are made up.
They're not found in nature.
You don't just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock'em Sock'em Robots.
Just pick another game.
Why don't we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?
No good-- Sheldon doesn't float.
That is true.
I have a higher than normal body density.
If I run too deep a bath, I drown.
All right, let's keep it simple.
How about darts?
Oh, that's not fair either.
Why not?
Darts is a bar game.
You've been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.
Yeah, that's when it started.
Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern- based competitions.
Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests-- they're all out.
Okay.
Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest.
I've won a few, but that's just because I spill when I'm drunk, so We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.
Uh-uh.
No.
I don't think so.
Are you sure?
I mean, the nose doesn't light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.
Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home!
Ma, the chain's on the door!
MRS.
Howard?
I thought I wasn't going to see you till tomorrow!
Yeah, well, Bernie's not feeling well, so I thought I'd stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.
Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I'm not decent!
All right.
Woman hasn't tied her robe in 20 years.
Suddenly she's not decent?
You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?
!
MRS.
Shh, you need to whisper.
Ma, who is in there?
Uh, nobody!
The TV is on!
I only got one sock.
Where's my other sock?
Who is that?
MRS.
I told you, it's the TV.
Jay Leno lost a sock; it's hilarious.
If you're busy, I can come back.
Just give me a second!
Go, go, go, go.
Dr. Schneider?
Oh, hello, Howard.
What are you doing here?
Um, house call.
You're a dentist.
Yes, yes, I am.
I think he's on to us!
Okay, glasses off.
Find Waldo.
Hurry up, find him, find him.
I'm trying!
Don't yell at me!
For goodness' sake, he's wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.
I know what he looks like.
Oh, there he is, I got him.
Yes, we win again!
How could you not find him?
Because he's hard to find.
If he was easy to find, the books would be called There's Waldo.
that's one minute.
Long division, long division.
Go, go, go.
Remember, show your work.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I'm not okay.
Get up, we can't lose in math.
Yes!
Aah!
Ready, set, wrestle.
One, two, three, pin.
Mwah!
Stop that.
Mwah!
Amy, do something.
Mwah.
Amy, help.
W-- Amy, stop that.
Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.
One to beam aboard?
Oh, my God, you're back.
Oh, look at you.
You, you look like you grew.
: Yeah.
The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I'm like an inch and a half taller.
I'm going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.
Oh, uh, come in, come in.
Oh, I, uh, I didn't think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.
Yeah, well, Bernadette's a little under the weather and my mom's kind of under my dentist.
Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?
Former dentist.
I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.
So you're wandering all around by yourself?
That's not the kind of hero's welcome an astronaut should come home to.
It's okay, you know, we space cowboys don't do what we do for glory and fame.
We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.
Oh, hey, man, welcome back.
Oh, Stuart, thanks.
What are you doing here?
I, I kind of live here now.
Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.
Ah, he's spoiling me and I love it.
Wow, so you guys are like buds now?
Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.
Plus, he doesn't have a girlfriend, I don't have a girlfriend.
It's like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other's holes.
Uh that sounds a little funny to an American ear.
Which part?
Just all of it.
Okay, so w-what do you guys got going on tonight?
Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.
Sound of Music sing-along?
That used to be our thing, but that's cool.
Oh, Howard, it's still our thing.
Come with us, we'll, we'll get you a scalped ticket.
So I'd be sitting by myself?
We'll switch.
You'll come sit with me after intermission.
So I-I-I'd be sitting by myself during "Edelweiss"?
No, no, you guys go.
Have fun.
Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?
Absolutely.
See you, Stuart.
Yeah, yeah.
Is he taller?
At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.
All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are: no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.
On the count of three.
One, two Wait.
I'm a little concerned.
Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.
So?
So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?
Sheldon, we haven't won a game all night.
Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I'm gonna stick that pie in your face.
That's rude.
One, two, three, eat.
Hey, guys, guess who's back from space.
Not now!
Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!
Snort it down and keep eating!
You look familiar.
I don't think so.
Yeah, I just saw you on the news.
You're an astronaut.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Good for you.
How about a piece of cheesecake on the house?
Oh, thank you so much.
I've been having the worst night.
I just got back, and my friends don't care, my wife's sick, I went to my mom You want the cheesecake or not?
Yes, please.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time Till touchdown brings me 'round again to find I'm not the man they think I am at home : Oh, no, oh, no I'm a rocket man.
Perfect.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.
Well, Howard, that's very nice of you.
Yeah, maybe.
Open it first.
It's my official NASA portrait.
"To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world.
Just like the guy in this picture was".
For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.
That's not true.
At the Walgreens, I was "over the moon" for their store-brand antacids.
Hey, Stuart, I see you're getting ready for your Halloween party.
Yeah, it's my annual attempt to meet women.
Ninth time's the charm.
Would you like me to help?
I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.
Thanks, but I can't afford je ne sais quois.
How much for just quois?
You know, you don't worry about money.
I'll take care of everything.
Really?
Yeah, you'll love it.
Ain't no party like a Koothra-party.
But you know what wasn't a party?
That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch.
I mean, it's your last night on Earth.
You'd think you'd get one porn channel.
Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?
Interesting hypothesis.
Let's apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.
Okay.
Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?
Anywhere but the Space Station.
On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf.
But, hey, you don't go there for the food, you go there for the view.
It's fascinating.
Let me see if I can duplicate the result.
Howard, I've always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit.
Care to weigh in?
Not really.
Oh, well.
You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon.
But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory.
Does it get any better than this?
I hope so.
Question.
Do you think your husband's fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?
It's not getting any better.
Uch.
It's Leonard.
He wants to go costume shopping later.
I thought you liked Halloween.
I do, it's just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store.
A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.
Like my husband?
And my boyfriend?
I'm, I'm sorry, Amy.
You were saying something about Howard's foreskin?
Nice try, but you have to go to that party 'cause we're going.
Yeah, I'm gonna go.
It's just not my idea of a good time.
Leonard does thing he doesn't like to make you happy.
Yeah, he's my boyfriend.
Isn't that, like, his job?
Then what's your job?
Letting him make me happy.
I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.
That's not always true.
Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.
I guess I could probably try a little harder.
You could start by taking an interest in his work.
Yeah, that's kind of a problem.
Why?
Not really clear on what he does.
He's an experimental physicist.
Yeah, I'm not really clear on what that means.
He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.
Yeah, you're really just making it worse.
What kind of tea would you like?
I think I'm gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.
Two tea bags in one cup?
You're not at a rave.
So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.
I couldn't agree more.
Really?
I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.
Oh, oh, on the contrary.
Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship.
Now imagine this: you and I entering Stuart's party and all eyes turn to see America's most beloved and glamorous couple.
Yeah?
R2-D2 and C-3PO!
Dibs on 3PO.
Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don't even like.
Okay!
I'm gonna let that slide because I know you're hopped up on tea bags.
I make compromises for you all the time.
Just this once, can't we find something that we're both happy with?
Fine.
How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century?
Hewlett and Packard.
Dibs on Hewlett.
What, you want to be Hewlett?
Anybody home?
Hey-hey-hey, what are you doing here?
I just thought I'd stop by and say hello.
Oh, what a nice surprise.
Oh.
I don't think you've ever seen my lab before.
No, I know.
It's long overdue.
So, what ya doing?
Better not be building a robot girlfriend.
No.
Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.
You're kidding.
Nope.
Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.
Ooh!
What's going on in here?
Oh, no, no, no, don't look in there.
What, is it secret?
No, it's a nitrogen laser.
It'll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.
Oh.
You might want to put a sign on it.
Sign right there.
Ah.
"Danger," sure, sure.
Yeah.
What's, what's that?
Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
Wow.
High-techie-techie.
What's this little box?
That is a pencil sharpener.
Ooh, low-techie-techie.
So, what are you working on right now?
It's actually pretty neat.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It's a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking.
Here, I'll show you.
We'll just put this pencil over here.
Sharp.
Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.
Very good.
And then a laser will map the reflective surface and voilÃ .
Wow.
That is amazing.
You know, there's a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.
What do you mean?
Oh!
Wow.
Uh-huh.
Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really just be information on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.
So it's possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.
Hmm.
What?
Sometimes I forget how smart you are.
You should visit more often.
What are you doing?
Take off your clothes.
What?
Here?
Now?
Yeah.
You got a problem with that?
No, no.
It's kind of crazy.
I've never fooled around in the lab before.
Really?
Never?
No.
I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn't long enough.
Before I forget, I'd like your opinion on the menus I've prepared for the Halloween party.
The theme is "food that goes bump in the night".
"Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon".
On Sesame seed Bunzillas.
"Night of the Living Garlic Bread"?
It's funny because "bread" sounds like "dead".
I'm sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns.
The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.
Ooh, Hallow-weenies!
That's a good one.
They'll pair nicely with my "Draculoni and Cheese".
How do I do it?
!
That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume.
But then I realized everyone would be, like, "Where's your costume?
Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut"?
Hello, boys.
What are you smiling at?
Nothing.
You know where's there's a lot of nothing.
Space.
Boy, it's nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again.
Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?
Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.
So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds.
What to do?
What to do to you?
Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty.
Preparing thrusters.
We have liftoff.
Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?
Okay, we need to talk.
What?
Howie, I know you went to space.
I'm incredibly proud of you.
But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute.
I don't talk about it every minute.
Tonight at dinner you went on about it for an hour straight.
What was I supposed to talk about?
We were eating at Johnny Rockets.
I'm just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.
So, I did this amazing thing and I'm never allowed to mention it?
Of course you can.
But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.
Okay, no problem.
It won't happen again.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I can't tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was you know.
What, I can't even point?
So, basically, this is what's called mag-lev technology.
It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity.
Here, you hold this.
Whoa!
That's heavy.
Yeah.
Oh, uh, you don't have on any jewelry, do you?
No.
Why?
A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings.
Now he's on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size.
Now watch this.
Whoa!
That is very cool.
Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I'm the super villain Magneto.
It's getting a little less cool, Leonard.
But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.
There we go.
So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy's tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.
A Tardis makes no sense.
It's a time machine from a science-fiction show.
It has nothing to do with Halloween.
That being said, if you don't get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.
Do you have a preference?
I don't care.
Get the Tardis.
Yes!
This party just became a major rager.
Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?
Yeah, sure, whatever.
I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones' mocha-skinned love child.
"Indian" Jones.
Clever.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Oh, Howard, I've got a party to plan.
Don't make me pull it out of you.
Okay, here it is.
Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space.
Is that true?
No.
Yes.
We seem to have different approaches here.
I was going for helpful honesty.
I have no idea what you're doing.
It's called being nice.
Okay.
If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I'll try it.
You know what, guys?
Never mind.
I just won't talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.
Look at that, the problem solved itself.
Hello, boys.
What if we were to go as dinner table favorites salt and pepper?
You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident.
How about Raggedy Ann and Andy?
I loved them growing up.
No, I don't think so.
Those dolls represent three things I do not care for: clowns, children and raggediness.
I think it's a lost cause.
No.
There are certain things that say to the world, "I have a boyfriend, and he's not made up".
Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes.
Pick one.
What's a hickey?
How do I look?
Fine.
Uh-oh, is someone a little blue?
Come on, Howie, that's like the funniest thing I've ever said in my life.
What do you say?
You ready to go?
To tell you the truth, I'm not really in the mood.
What are you talking about?
It'll be fun.
All your friends'll be there.
Yeah, some friends.
They all think I'm boring.
Maybe you should go without me.
No, if I'm there alone, people might think I'm just a really short person from Avatar.
I'm sorry.
I just don't want to go.
Hey, I just spent the last three hours coloring myself blue.
I'm gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month!
Fine.
Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.
Yeah, well, now you're a Smurf.
Keep walking.
Oh, my God, you guys look adorable!
Thanks, so do you.
Slutty cop?
No, sexy cop.
Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.
And Albert Einstein?
Ja, und later she's going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.
I thought we said in the car, no accents?
Sorry, Officer.
Hello!
It's a great party!
Thank you!
The monster foods, they're really fun.
Oh, yes, thank you.
I like to think of fun things like that because I'm fun.
I'm not clinically depressed at all.
Sheldon, get in here!
I should've picked hickey.
Hey, hey, look at you guys!
I'm Raggedy Ann, and he's Raggedy C-3PO.
It was a compromise.
I lost.
Can you believe Stuart's walking around taking credit for this party?
Who cares?
What do you mean "who cares"?
Look at what I pulled off here.
The deejay's on fire, there's a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food!
Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.
You're right, the party's fantastic.
Please, tell me more.
I haven't heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old!
Is this about the space thing again?
Well, I'm not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space!
Space, space, space!
Space, space, space!
Whoa, Drinky Smurf.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Great, now I'm in trouble.
You happy?
!
You, out!
You are being very rude!
No, I'm not.
They're all being rude.
And you're being rude.
Me?
What did I do?
"Oh, Howie "stop talking about space so much.
Nobody likes it".
I don't sound like that.
You're my wife.
You're supposed to be on my side.
I'm always on your side.
Then why are you trying to take this away from me?
Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I'm ever gonna do.
If I stop talking about it, then I'm just Just what?
Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.
Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.
You're just saying that.
No, I'm not.
I married him.
On purpose.
Come here.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Nothing to see here.
Just sexy police business.
Just explaining the theory of relativity.
Twice.
Hey, what you watching?
I don't know.
Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.
Here you go.
It's a Milky Way.
The Milky Way's a galaxy in space.
I've been in space.
Here's a Mars bar.
I'm an astronaut.
And this one's a Moon Pie.
I walked on the Moon.
What have you done?
Okay, I get it.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Try to keep up, Howard!
I'm killing it!
Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now.
Don't worry, this is exactly how you look when you're dancing in clubs.
You're welcome, ladies.
Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen!
Dude!
I was about to Bollywood this bitch.
Earlier today, I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends.
Moments ago, he accepted my request.
Do you understand what that means?
That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying, "Damn it.
I meant to click no".
I'll walk you through it.
The game is not called Words with Strangers.
No, it's not even called Words with Acquaintances.
It is called Words with I'm not finishing your sentence.
You pulled the plug on my funk.
Friends!
It's Words with Friends!
Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are.
Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide; I'll have everything I've ever wanted since I was six years old.
That's really nice, Sheldon.
I'm happy for you.
And I'm happy for you, too.
You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking.
Enjoy it, boys.
You may have peaked.
Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking.
I worked with him.
And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked with, you'll be off to the races.
Sheldon, I don't think this actually means Hold that thought!
Professor Hawking has made a move.
Boy, oh, boy.
Oh, it's only a matter of time before we're coming up with fun nicknames for each other.
I'll be Coop.
He'll be Wheels.
If he's okay with that.
All right.
Crank up the AC, boy!
It's gonna get hot in here!
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
So, I was taking a shower this morning, and when I got out, I started to dry off with what I thought was a towel but turned out to be Howard's mom's underwear.
I had to take another shower.
It wasn't enough.
Nothing will ever be enough.
I once looked in Sheldon's underwear drawer.
He yelled at me.
But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.
There's a book under here.
Oh, I'll get that.
I got it.
I got it.
No, no, it's Why do you have a history textbook?
It's not a big deal.
Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.
That's great.
I didn't know you wanted to go back to school.
It's just one history class.
Look, I didn't finish college, so I thought I would give it a try.
Not to mention, your acting career is going south like Sherman.
Read about it in your book.
Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?
No, I'm not embarrassed.
I just didn't want anyone to know because I haven't told Leonard yet.
Why wouldn't you tell Leonard?
Because it's me going back to school, and he's gonna be all "you can do it," and "how can I help"?
and "I'm so proud of you".
Ugh!
I just can't believe you could keep something like that from him.
You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.
Really?
You can't think of anyone weirder?
I can, but she's sitting right there.
Yes!
I play the word "quiver " with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points.
That ought to let the air out of your tires, Hawking.
Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn't smell like tar.
Everything really is coming up Amy.
It is glorious.
One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits.
And I'm spanking him so hard his grad students won't be able to sit down.
You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises.
What's your point?
It's exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.
Ooh!
My friend Stephen just played the word "act" for 18 points.
That's right, I call him Stephen now.
Because I checked, and he was not okay with Wheels.
Oh, you could turn his "act" into "extract," and it would be for double points.
Amy.
Why would you give me a word?
Now, if I play "extract" it would be cheating.
Sorry.
Although, I could play the completely unrelated and better word "extract" Ethical conundrum avoided.
Thanks, brain.
Spaghetti okay?
It's crunchy.
Just the way I like it.
Yeah, I don't think the water was really boiling.
It's great.
I love it.
Okay, listen, there's something I need to tell you.
I've been thinking about going back to school for a while now.
So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.
Oh.
That's great!
Great, great, great!
Why wait so long to tell me?
I don't want you to make a big deal out of it.
Why do you think I'd be like that?
I get it, you're taking one class.
It's nice.
Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enroll full-time.
Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.
You're making it a big deal.
Sorry.
Whatever.
It's all good.
Anyway, that's it.
I just thought you should know.
Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?
It's really good.
We've been talking about the origins of slavery.
Turn in my first paper tomorrow.
Great topic.
I can help with that.
There are lots of different perspectives you can take: economic, sociological, political Hey, this is my paper.
And my perspective is that slavery is bad.
Oh, and my professor's black, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.
Can I take a look?
No, Leonard, this is my thing.
Okay, I get it.
Thank you.
It's like when I started doing chin-ups; I didn't want you to see until I could do one.
FYI, really close.
Thank you.
Now behave yourself and eat your dinner.
Maybe later, if you're lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl.
Really?
'Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once.
I think the next time I have to speak to a call center in India, I'm going to try using an American accent.
Why?
Because when I use my regular voice, I feel like I'm making fun of them.
That's ridiculous.
Not to mention, your American accent is terrible.
Dude, my accent is brilliant.
Hey, my snow-white American friends, let's put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we're all obese.
This is what you sound like.
I think I'm talking in an American accent, but it really sounds like I'm wearing a set of giant dentures.
Sheldon, do I really sound like that?
Tell him he sounds like that.
Sheldon, you okay?
It's been three days.
Why hasn't Stephen Hawking played a word?
The guy's a genius.
Maybe you weren't challenging enough for him.
Not challenging?
I was humiliating the man.
I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.
There's the problem.
You can't beat Hawking like that.
He hates to lose.
Everyone knows the guy's a big baby.
I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.
Really?
One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix.
I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting.
So I looked it up online and showed him.
Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me.
And then he was all, "Your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix".
Good Lord, what have I done?
Good Lord, what have I done?
Terrible.
All right, hotshot, let's hear your Indian.
I can't sit on that elephant, ass is on fire from eating all this curry.
Okay, yeah, that's pretty good.
Please be good.
Please be good.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
She writes like she cooks.
Play.
Play.
Play.
Play.
Play.
What are you doing?
Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking.
Play.
Play.
Oh He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.
I did a bad thing.
Does it affect me?
No.
Then suffer in silence.
Play.
Play.
Play.
Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawking.
Penny started taking a class.
She wrote a paper, she didn't want me to read it, I went behind her back and I read it anyway.
Stephen Hawking hates me.
I don't know what to do.
I mean, the paper's terrible.
But if I tell her, she'll know that I read it and she'll get really mad.
I was beating him so bad, he doesn't want to be friends anymore.
Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?
Is it possible we're having two different conversations?
How would I know?
I'm not listening to you.
Hang on.
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Chess clock.
We each get five minutes to talk about our problems.
We'll take turns.
Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend.
Begin.
I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends.
He stopped playing.
And now we're not friends anymore.
He's probably busy.
You're worried about nothing.
Give it a couple more days.
I'm sure he'll play, and you'll see that everything's fine.
My turn.
I can't let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her it's bad without letting her know that I read it?
Hmm.
Beats me.
Now I know Hawking's not busy because I can see he's playing other people right now.
Maybe since you're so good, he's taking his time to meet the challenge.
I want Penny to enjoy school Wolowitz told me he's a big baby!
But I didn't know that, and I played "extract" for 82 points.
It's all Amy's fault.
She told me to play it.
I have got to cut her loose.
Sheldon, I wasn't done talking.
She hands in the paper tomorrow.
I know I could help her.
And she's my girlfriend I-I should be allowed to help her.
Why aren't I allowed to help her?
Yeah, I hear you, brother.
No.
You need to give me some advice.
Fine.
Women, huh?
No Specific to my situation.
Blonde women, huh?
Empathetic!
It sucks to be you.
I quit.
Leonard, wait.
No.
I listened to your dumb thing.
Leonard, come back.
Leonard, come back.
Leonard, come back.
What?
Oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded.
Good morning, sunshine.
Leonard.
It's 8:00 a.m. It's like the middle of the night.
I know, but I have to go to work, and I made you breakfast.
Oh, wow, that's so sweet.
Hey, what's this?
Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of "The Shoemaker and the Elves"?
Elves?
Come on, Leonard.
- It's too early for Lord of the Rings.
- No, no.
Listen, um Once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him.
And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he-he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all.
Open it.
Okay.
"An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South: What the hell is this?
Don't ask me.
A little elf did it.
So let me get this straight.
You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?
No, I assumed it would be good.
Then I read it.
What?
!
No, I I mean, it was good.
There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.
W You changed every word.
That's not true.
Uh "Slavery".
"1619," your name at the top-- that's all you.
You are such an ass.
This is exactly why I didn't want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.
Please don't be upset.
I-I just I didn't want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school.
Right, because me being in school is so important to you.
That way, you wouldn't have to be dating someone who's only a waitress.
Oh, come on, you know that's not true.
Do I?
Listen to me.
I need to do this on my own.
If I fail, I fail.
If I pass, I pass.
Do you get it?
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help.
Yeah, well, next time don't.
Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not "The Shoemaker and the Elves," okay?
This is, "Give a man a fish, he eats it.
"Teach a man to fish, he sells it or something".
Whatever, I don't know!
It's just a lot better than what you did, you big jerk!
You ever hear back from Hawking?
No.
It would appear as if I've lost him.
Stupid brain.
It'll be okay.
How can it be okay?
Stephen Hawking's a genius and he talks like a robot.
It's everything I've ever wanted in a friend.
Yeah, but if he's a sore loser, maybe you're better off without him.
You're right.
I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you.
He played!
He played!
Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again.
He was okay with that nickname.
So, now all you have to do is let him win.
Yeah, way ahead of you.
I will play the word "at" for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world.
What are you waiting for?
Hit "send".
I can't.
Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.
So don't do it.
Oh, but I want to be Hawking's friend.
So do it.
No, but if I do, I'll be a phony, a sellout, a Hollywood poser.
Then don't do it.
I won't.
This feels right.
My mother always said, "To thine own self be true".
Good for you.
'Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know?
And send.
Oh, hey.
Haven't heard from you in a couple days.
You still mad at me?
Nope.
I have no reason to "B" mad at you.
Minus.
Wow.
That's right.
On my paper.
Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.
I don't know what to say.
Hmm, how about, "Gee, Penny, you're smarter than I thought.
"You may be the one in school, "but I'm the one who learned a lesson.
I'm so stupid, Penny.
Duh" She sounds exactly like you!
How'd it go with Leonard?
I don't think he'll be making that mistake again.
Good.
So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.
Got it.
Understood.
Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper.
I think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an "A".
Uh, but we got you a B-minus on purpose to make it believable.
Believable?
You saying I'm not smart?
No, no!
You're smart.
That's better.
I feel like I'm in high school again.
Yeah, doing the prom queen's homework so she'll like us.
I know.
It's finally working.
It's Stephen Hawking.
Answer it.
I want to hear.
Professor Hawking, how nice of you to call.
Hello.
I really enjoyed our game, Dr. Cooper.
Oh, me, too.
Or should I say Dr. Loser?
Ha, ha, ha.
Yes, congratulations.
You won fair and square.
Uh, very impressive, sir.
Do you like brain teasers?
Oh, I love brain teasers.
What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common?
They both suck.
Neener neener.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags.
Before we get started, I'd like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition.
But I can't.
The only entry was from GameyGamer75, and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks.
Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek.
And to help me, I'm pleased to introduce Internet personality, former star of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized in 1/16 scale-- set phasers to "fun" for my friend, Wil Wheaton.
Hi, Sheldon.
Thanks for having me.
I'm happy to be here.
Cut.
What's wrong?
Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always.
Wil, that was a little wooden.
Wooden?
Don't worry, it wasn't terrible.
Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound.
And action.
My friend, Wil Wheaton.
Hi, Sheldon.
Thanks for having me.
I'm excited to be here.
So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
Well, this is an exciting one.
This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.
Now what's interesting about this flag Cut.
What was wrong with that?
It's called "Fun with Flags".
They're not at half-mast, nobody died.
Let's try and keep it upbeat.
Um, no offense, but I've been acting since I was a kid.
I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.
It's true.
In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH.
You moved me.
You'll have to forgive me.
This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.
So do I. Great.
So, this time let's try more real boy, less Pinocchio.
And action.
And cut.
You realize that I'm doing this for free, right?
Yes.
And so far, we're still not getting our money's worth.
Let's try it again.
Everybody's having fun.
And action.
So, Wil what do you have for us first?
Well, this is an exciting one.
This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.
Cut.
Problem, first-time director?
Oh, none that I could see.
I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do.
I got goose bumps.
He was overacting on purpose.
Really?
He reminded me of a young William Shatner.
Listen, Sheldon, I'm really happy to do this for you, but not if she's gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.
You gonna let him speak to me like that?
Well you're my girlfriend and I don't want you to be upset.
Then again, Wil Wheaton's my friend and I don't want him to be upset.
Hmm This is a sticky wicket.
What do you think?
Can I speak to you for a second?
I'll be right back.
Feel free to play with yourself.
I don't care for your friend, he's being rude to me.
You need to ask him to leave.
Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave.
He's a minor celebrity.
Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.
Fine.
Then maybe I should go.
Could you?
That would solve everything.
You are the best.
I'll see you at dinner tonight?
You sure you wouldn't rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?
Come to think of it, I would!
You, little lady, are on fire.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.
Don't take it personally.
She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.
You ready to go?
Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.
I don't understand why you keep your stuff here when there's plenty of room at home.
What are you talking about?
All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer.
Ooh, there's my plaid dickie.
Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents.
Can you believe it?
Let's go.
You know, it's kinda late.
Why don't we just spend the night here?
Because we don't live here.
I know.
Do you?
You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.
That's not true.
MRS.
Howard, I'm doing laundry!
You want me to put anything in for you?
!
There's some underwear in the hamper!
Oh, good!
I got that new stain stick to try out!
Thank you!
I only put it on the list two weeks ago!
Okay, I see what you're getting at.
How about this weekend I'll box up all my things and move them to our place.
Thank you.
The lightsabers are gonna look great in the living room.
Or in the closet.
We can decide later.
Howard, help!
My hand's stuck in the garbage disposal!
Let go of whatever piece of food you're holding!
MRS.
Are you kidding?
!
It's a perfectly good chicken leg!
Hey, look who's out after dark, like a big boy.
I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton.
Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.
I thought you had plans with Amy.
Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S.
She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner.
That place really did remind me of my hometown.
Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.
Hold on.
Wil and Amy had an argument?
Yes, quite the kerfuffle.
Then Amy got mad and left?
Walked right out the door.
And you?
Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price.
The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yogurt machine.
Right next to it!
I was closer to it than I am to you right now.
Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.
Why's that?
Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.
You're just repeating what I said.
It's like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
Trust me, call her.
Fine.
It's a shame you didn't go to dinner with us, because the buffet you're about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yogurt.
I was this close.
What?
You'll appreciate this.
Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you're mad at me.
Tell him you're not mad at me.
Go ahead, set him straight.
I'm mad at you, Sheldon.
Hmm.
Eat one of your Luna bars.
Very often when women think they're angry, they're really just hungry.
I'm not hungry.
Your friend insulted me, and you didn't do anything.
Precisely, I didn't do anything.
Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?
Keep going, buddy, you're doing great.
Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side.
That's it.
End of story.
Good night.
Wow, Amy's mad and Leonard was right.
What a weird day.
Hey.
Sorry this took so long.
But you used to work here, you know how it is.
Kitchen slammed again?
No, I'm a terrible waitress, remember?
So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?
Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.
What's your excuse this time?
No excuse.
It's just, you know, I'm Jewish, and technically, we're not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath.
So this one's on God.
That might be a little more convincing if you didn't have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.
My religion's kinda loosey-goosey.
Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don't wear a cross, you're good.
Howie, you promised you'd move.
And I will.
Yeah, right.
I will.
I'm obviously not going to live in my mother's house for the rest of my life.
I'm not a child.
I've seen her burp you.
She did not burp me.
She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp.
Don't you have other tables you should be waiting on?
Yeah, but I told you, I'm not good at my job.
Bernadette, listen to me.
He is never gonna leave.
I'm starting to think you're right.
All right, I've had enough of this.
I'm a grown man, I have a successful career.
For the love of God, I've been to space!
I will move out when I'm ready, and I don't need anyone badgering me into it!
Wow, excuse me.
That was just for her benefit.
I'll move tomorrow.
I love you.
Don't leave me.
Amy.
Amy.
Angry Amy.
What?
I've been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.
Star Trek DVDs?
Why would I want this?
First of all, you're welcome.
Furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton's body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure.
Get ready for 130 hours of "I told you so".
Fine.
I'll just tell you what happens.
Episode one, "Encounter at Farpoint".
Fade in.
The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV.
Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy She's hooked.
Wow.
An end of an era.
Boy, if these walls could talk.
They'd say, "Why does he touch himself so much"?
Yeah.
I can't believe I'm not going to live here anymore.
This has always been my bedroom.
Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.
Oh, yeah.
Fifth grade.
Sixth grade.
Seventh grade.
Eighth grade.
Ninth grade.
I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy.
Had some Peanut M&M'S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital.
Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.
When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?
Sometime around the third Almond Joy.
Okay.
You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, would you do me a favor?
Go on ahead.
I just want one last moment alone in my old room.
We're not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.
Fine, let's go.
Hey.
What brings you in?
Penny, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to have a conversation about girls.
I had a feeling we'd have a talk like this sooner or later.
Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
Penny, please, I'm on the horns of a relationship dilemma.
And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.
And for the record  So what are you drinking?
Well, it's been a rough day.
I usually go chamomile tea, but I don't think that's going to cut it.
You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.
Will that calm my nerves?
It's calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
Sold.
Oh.
So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?
The trouble isn't with me, Penny, it's with your gender.
Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.
Yeah, Amy told me what happened.
Look, just apologize.
It'll warm her twaddle.
It's a Band-Aid at best.
The core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other.
Which is baffling because they're both crazy about me.
And I like them, which indicates they're bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.
Honey, you can't make people like each other.
Not true.
Leonard made me like you.
And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe.
Cheers, pal.
Ooh.
Boy, that is a treat that's hard to beat.
Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I'm having a tea party.
You might want to pace yourself.
I drink tea all the time.
I think I know what I'm doing.
Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis.
Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay?
Your problem is the way you treated Amy.
My problem is I'm out of tea.
Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it.
I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.
Penny, please, I think I've evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.
Sorry.
On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.
Welcome to Long Island, Tex.
Amy deserves better.
You know, when we buy the Planter's deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don't have to look at them.
She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel.
Yeah, that she is.
Here you go.
I'm a callous egomaniac.
She's gonna leave me.
No, she won't.
No, she won't.
I'm great.
Okay, I have now officially moved out of my mother's house.
You are now the only woman in my life who I'll see naked in the bathroom.
I know this wasn't easy.
You doing okay?
Oh, I'm fine.
It's just her I'm worried about.
Aw, she'll be okay.
She's a grown woman.
I know.
It's just ever since my dad left, I've felt responsible for her.
That's a lot for a kid to deal with.
She was just so sad all the time.
Yeah, I was the only person who could cheer her up.
Well, me and Ben and Jerry.
She's lucky you were there.
You know, she's why I first got into magic.
I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape.
And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage.
I can still remember the way she'd smile.
For a few minutes, she'd forget how lonely she was.
Aw, crap.
Let's go.
Where we going?
Grab a box.
We'll sleep at your mother's place tonight.
No, but I want to live here.
Well, you should've thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.
Can't we talk about this?
No husband of mine is gonna break his mother's heart!
Wil Wheaton!
Wil Wheaton!
Wait, how many was that?
Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Have you been drinking?
Just tea.
The best tea I've ever had.
Why are you here?
I'll tell you.
I'm from Texas.
Need I say more?
Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.
You insulted my woman.
I'm here to defend her honor.
Two!
It was two.
Wil Wheaton!
Now prepare yourself for what may come.
Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we're gonna fight?
My fists are not up here because I'm milking a giant invisible cow.
They're up to beat an apology out of you.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.
Are you okay?
You're asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton.
As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting?
Never mind, I'll choose.
You were so good in Stand by Me.
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags.
Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek.
And to help us, I'm pleased to introduce a special guest-- surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here-- Mr. LeVar Burton.
Hey, Sheldon, it's a pleasure to be here.
Well, we've got some interesting flags for  Cut!
Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.
I don't know what she's talking about, but I'm obligated to agree with her.
She's my girlfriend.
Ah, I hear you, brother.
I still get lunch, right?
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
What are you drawing over there?
A hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.
Oh, you silly doodlebug.
You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.
It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard.
You can block it with a Frisbee.
Calm down.
Do you expect me to build this?
I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin.
Gentlemen.
Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at 2:45?
Really?
He probably just goes to the bathroom.
Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at 8:00 a.m. with optional follow-ups at 1:45 and 7:10 on high-fiber Fridays.
It's sad that you know that.
Oh, that's just the tip of the sadness iceberg.
I'm looking at his public calendar.
Yesterday, 2:45 to 3:05, nothing.
Last week, nothing.
Last month, nothing.
He never has anything booked during that time.
completely unaccounted for.
We should figure out where he goes.
Ooh, this is exciting.
Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.
Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?
Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.
It was tapenade and you guys suck.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
So, how was work today?
Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.
That sounds like fun.
Yeah, it was.
Oh, good, I guessed right.
Who you talking to?
Oh, just this guy I met at school.
Oh, great.
We're still dating, right?
Relax.
He's just a friend.
We're doing an oral report together.
He's really nice.
I'm sorry, what was that?
I had a little stroke after "oral".
Would you stop?
Look, he just moved here from London, okay?
He doesn't really know anybody.
Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.
No.
That's not true.
There's French, there's Italian.
No, you're right, it's the best.
Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
It didn't come up.
Well, maybe you should tell him.
What am I supposed to say?
Say, "Can't talk right now.
"Hanging with my boyfriend.
England sucks, you suck, USA number one".
Fine.
"Hanging with my boyfriend.
Talk to you later".
Happy?
Yes.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
What did he say?
Nothing.
What?
"Did your boyfriend make you type that"?
I hate this guy.
Don't be like that.
Come on, trust me, he's hitting on you.
No, he's not.
We're just friends.
Look, is this gonna be a problem?
Because he's supposed to come over tomorrow to work.
Really?
Here?
If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll switch partners, even though the thing's due next week and everyone already has a partner and I'll probably end up failing the class.
That'd be great.
Thank you.
right on schedule.
Hey, Sheldon.
Oh, hello.
Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny.
Want to come with us?
No, thank you.
Are you sure?
They turn off the lights, and it's like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.
I'm quite sure.
Good day.
Well, where are you going?
Where are you going?
We just told you.
I just told you.
No, you didn't.
Well, it's your word against mine; see you in court.
Should we follow him?
I don't know, I'm torn.
I want to know where he's going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.
Hi, guys.
Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?
No.
Don't you know his schedule?
All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find "quieter pants".
Come on.
Boy, what I wouldn't give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.
This is where he goes?
What's in there?
I think it's an old storage room.
What could he be doing in there every day for 20 minutes?
Well, he's not doing because if he were, he would have way better abs.
: Can you hear anything?
Not yet.
: What are you doing?
I'm listening.
Can't you face the other way and listen?
I can't do anything right for you, can I?
What the hell is he up to?
He is kind of a weirdo.
Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there.
Or Bill Gates.
Or Stephen Hawking.
Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?
Howard, please, you can't treat the man differently just because he's disabled.
That's not okay.
If you're wondering why I've been staring through the peephole, I'm trying to get a look at this guy who's coming over to Penny's.
To be honest, I didn't know you were here.
It's not a big deal.
He's just in her history class.
They're working on a project together.
I don't even know why I care.
You know what, I don't care.
You think you don't care.
This is silly.
I have nothing to worry about.
Oh, I don't know.
Statistically speaking, I'm sure you have something to worry about.
What do you mean?
Well, if we assume your looks are average, right off the bat, are more attractive than you.
That's 1.5 billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.
Well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks.
I'm way above average in a lot of other things.
Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.
I'm talking about important things like emotional maturity.
You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
I liked it better when you thought I wasn't here.
I'm not saying you don't have attractive qualities.
Your choice of friends is impeccable, you're a good sleeper.
And last but not least, you buy the grapes I like.
You're a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.
None of this matters.
I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing's gonna happen with this guy.
Well, unless of course he's a skilled hypnotist.
What?
While unlikely, it's still a statistical possibility.
She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.
Now you're just being ridiculous.
Am I?
The mind's a mysterious thing, Leonard.
He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she's a chicken pecking for corn.
Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.
I think we're more like ninjas.
I don't want to be a ninja; I want to be a cat burglar.
Fine, I'll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.
No, we both have to be the same thing.
Okay, we're ninjas.
Thank you.
But next time, we'll be cat burglars.
It's locked.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Now, you stand guard, I'm going to It's locked.
Just keep an eye out.
I'll have this open in a minute.
When did you learn how to pick locks?
When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.
How did that work out?
Pretty good.
I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a 12-mile radius.
There.
Ready?
Hold on, hold on.
What?
Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.
Yeah, so?
What if it's booby-trapped?
Don't worry, I'm one step ahead of him.
Great, what's your pl Are we good?
: Yeah.
Huh.
Forty-three.
What the hell does that mean?
I don't know.
The solution to an equation?
Maybe.
It's a prime number.
Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.
What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?
He's always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
It's paprika.
Really?
Well, okay, one mystery solved.
MAN : Okay, good night.
Thanks, Cole.
See you at school.
See you.
I'll be right back.
I thought you left a long time ago.
What's up?
Hey.
You moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?
No, I was just visiting a friend.
Oh, cool.
That cute blonde on four?
Yeah.
You know her?
I, well, I see her around.
I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.
Really?
Yeah.
He's ganged up.
She told me he's a scientist.
That's the name of his gang.
The Scientists.
They are crazy.
Well, thanks for the tip.
No problem, brother.
Stay frosty.
We're still dating, right?
Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.
Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard.
Dr. Hofstadter is my father.
And my mother.
And my sister.
And our cat.
Although, I'm pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter's degree was honorary.
May I join you, Leonard?
Sure.
Thanks.
Hey, Alex, let me ask you something.
My girlfriend knows this guy at school.
He's got an English accent.
Ooh, I love English accents.
Yeah, you all do.
Anyway, I feel like he's hitting on her.
She says he's just being nice and that I should trust her.
It's probably harmless.
You know how it is.
I'm sure you get hit on all the time.
Right.
Because girls are always like, "Ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms "and gets a lot of ear infections.
I got to get me some of that".
I don't know, I bet it happens more than you realize.
Trust me, it doesn't.
You sure?
You're cute, you're funny.
Maybe you're getting hit on, and you don't even know it.
Really?
I'm pretty sure.
Okay, I got to get back to work.
Thanks for listening.
No problem.
Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.
Come on, we're smart guys.
We can figure this out.
Forty-three.
What is 43?
Besides my mom's neck size.
It's the atomic number for technetium.
That stuff's radioactive.
Do you think he's building a bomb?
It took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star; I'm not worried.
Ooh, this could be something.
in half a cup of fat-free yogurt.
Why would you know that?
I'm sorry.
We can't all eat whatever we want and still stay thin.
Wait, in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, isn't 43 the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything?
That's 42, dumb-ass.
Hey, hey.
Feelings.
We should stop.
I'm exhausted.
Yeah, me, too.
We've got more important things to do.
Who cares what stupid 43 means?
Not me.
Let's go home.
You want to get something to eat?
Sounds good.
What the balls is 43?
!
I have to know!
Hi.
Hey, shouldn't you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?
Come on, I'm sorry.
I just can't believe you don't trust me.
I do, of course I do.
Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?
Really?
Your picture's on my refrigerator.
Oh.
You know, I'm really starting to not like this guy.
What is your problem?
Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?
I don't know.
It's hard sometimes.
Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I'm standing right there.
And they're all taller than me.
Why is everyone taller than me?
You know what, this is all in my head.
It's my problem, not yours.
Leonard, why do you always do this?
Listen to me, you're the one I'm with.
You know I love you, so will you please relax because you're driving me crazy.
You know that's the first time you ever said that you love me.
Yeah.
We're just supposed to pretend it's not a big deal?
That's exactly what we're gonna do because you're about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you're gonna start crying.
You're right, you should go.
: All right.
She loves me.
"Hey, it's Alex.
"Nice having coffee with you.
"If you want to talk more, I'm always available.
Smiley face, smiley face".
What a friendly girl.
Okay, picture's up.
Looks like the camera's working.
That's good quality video.
It better be.
It's the spare camera for the Mars rover.
How did you get your hands on that?
Million dollar camera-- ten dollar lock.
Oh, my God, here he comes.
This is it.
What the hell is that thing?
I don't know.
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Experimental log.
Wormhole generator test 44.
Wormhole generator test?
The first 43 parallel universes I've checked proved to be empty.
I see no reason to suspect universe number 44 will be any different.
Oh, my God!
Holy crap!
Oh!
It's eating my face!
Aah!
It's eating his face!
I found your Webcam and replaced the video feed.
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
Sheldon, we're really sorry.
Yeah, really sorry.
Sorry?
You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life.
You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to.
It's exhausting.
Which is why, for 20 minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.
But what are you doing in there?
And what does 43 mean?
You don't need to know, you don't deserve to know, and you will never know.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight Drat.
I'm never going to get to 43 again.
One, two, three, four Rats.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
They are not.
They are, too.
Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data.
You're just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.
No, you're displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter.
Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.
Oh, yeah?
Mummies are wrapped in bandages.
That's called a fashion choice.
All right, you brought this on yourself.
Sheldon, get him.
If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie.
However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite.
So, like a zombie, that's been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.
Good boy.
Here's a cookie.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, fellas, what's going on?
Mummies and zombies again.
Oh, they're not the same thing.
You get a cookie, too.
Thanks.
Guess who picked up his new car this morning?
Congratulations.
- Does it have that new car smell?
- Yep!
For as long as I can keep my mother out of it.
If you want to check it out later, it's parked right out front, space 294.
I'm sorry-- 294?
- Yeah.
- That's my parking spot.
Why do you have a parking spot?
You don't have a car.
You don't even drive.
It doesn't matter.
That's my spot.
Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.
Well, I'm not using my nipples, either.
Maybe they should reassign those.
Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I'm sure they'll give you another parking space.
Well, I don't want another parking space.
I want my parking space.
It's perfect.
I-it's a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half.
It's a mere 28 steps from the building entrance.
Uh, the nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel.
Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.
Fun story.
Meanwhile, you still don't have a car.
Don't try to change the subject.
This is about a parking space.
It has nothing to do with cars.
Are you listening to yourself?
I always listen to myself.
It's one of the great joys of my life.
Now, get your car out of my spot.
Nope.
Very well.
You leave me no choice.
What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
President Siebert, listen to reason.
Yeah, I understand I don't use the parking spot, but that's not the point.
I Yes, I'm aware you told me not to call you at home.
But you didn't answer the door!
And I know you were there, because I saw you through the mail slot.
Well, that's some salty language.
May I remind you that you're the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club.
There it is again.
Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
Oh, well, I'm sorry for your loss.
- Oh!
- Good night, sir.
Unbelievable.
He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he's a high-profile asset to the university.
Well, he's not wrong.
Howard did go to the International Space Station.
Yeah, that was five weeks ago.
How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?
Sheldon, let it go.
It's not a big deal.
No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard.
It starts with a parking space.
Where does it end?
It's like my dad always said, "First they say you can't drink and drive.
"Next thing you know, you can't let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat".
All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.
Leonard, you're my best friend.
Why don't you ever take my side?
Because I can never understand your side!
Give it back.
I'm sorry, but could you be more specific?
My Iron Man helmet.
Koothrappali saw you take it.
Give it back.
Oh, that.
Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren't using it.
You know, apparently, those are the rules we live by now.
Payback-- it truly is the B word, isn't it?
Sheldon, that is a $500 limited edition collectible, and I want it back.
I'd love to help you out, but unfortunately, I'm using it.
Fine.
I'm taking your diploma.
Go ahead.
That's the only doctorate you'll ever get.
It smells funny in here.
We're so proud of you, Amy.
Your first bikini wax.
Yeah.
So, how you doing?
A little sensitive, but not bad.
Does it always take that long?
Uh, no, they usually don't have to go out and get more wax.
I feel like I'm five pounds lighter.
Really?
Only five?
Hey, anybody want a drink?
- Okay.
- Sure.
So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?
For hours.
Fortunately, I couldn't understand most of it 'cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.
Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.
I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males.
At some point, they're bound to lock horns.
I'm assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?
I'm really sorry they took Sheldon's spot away.
He shouldn't have to suffer just because Howard's such a big deal now.
I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, I mean, Howard's never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.
You're right.
And I'm sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.
- If and when?
- Okay, maybe we should change the subject.
Amy, how are your lady parts?
Still chilly down there?
Hang on.
None of Sheldon's theories have ever been definitively proven.
My husband actually went to outer space.
That's an impressive accomplishment.
He's now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don't have to be special or even qualified to go into space.
You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax.
My My-my sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape.
It's a bad idea Gosh, Amy.
I'm sensing a little hostility.
Is it maybe because, like Sheldon's work, your sex life is also theoretical?
Damn.
Well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won't be thinking about his mother.
And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard's lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.
Anyway, to this day, I still can't see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.
I don't have to take this.
I'm gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now.
Maybe I'll let him do it to me in the parking spot.
Which sounds dirty, but I didn't mean it that way!
Okay, here's another one.
If a zombie bites a vampire, and the vampire bites a human, does the human become a vampire or a zombie?
Or a zompire?
Sheldon?
Cookie.
I don't have any.
Well, I'm not giving it away.
Hi, Sheldon.
He's in my spot.
Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.
Howard, what are you doing?
He wasn't using it.
And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.
Get off there.
Give me back my Iron Man helmet.
Give me back my parking space.
You don't need a parking space.
You don't have a car.
You don't need an Iron Man helmet.
You're not Iron Man.
Well, we appear to have reached an impasse.
And you know, I have to say, I thought you'd be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.
I-I didn't pick up on that.
That's a nice touch.
This is so exciting.
I'm feeling all tingly.
Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.
Keep a lookout.
This place is swarming with campus security.
They will not hesitate to scold us.
Freaking pigs.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let's get out of here.
Wait, I'm leaving my car here?
Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake.
Really makes these things tough to budge.
Before I park, come in the backseat.
I want to show you something I had done today.
All right, color me intrigued.
What do you think?
I think you're high on paint fumes.
And boy, that's a lot of Band-Aids.
Okay, Howard's mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.
What can I tell ya?
She's a big girl.
Wherever you look, there she is.
More coffee?
No, Leonard's taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee'll just keep me awake.
Oh, I'll get it.
Oh, looks like someone's on Team Bernadette.
Where's Howard?
He's not here.
What's wrong?
He had my car towed.
It cost me $200 to get it back.
Oh, no.
Where was it parked?
In Sheldon's spot.
That doesn't make sense.
Sheldon doesn't have a spot.
Was it maybe in Howard's spot?
Don't play dumb with me, sister.
You tell your husband he owes me $200.
Well, that doesn't make sense, either.
Why not?
Because I'm the one who had it towed.
You?
Didn't see that one coming, did ya?
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're not gonna see this coming.
Ow!
Ow!
Oh, my God, are you okay?
!
What the hell do you have in there?
!
Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I've been meaning to take to the bank.
Don't move.
I'll get some ice.
Are you okay?
Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what's left of your pubes!
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.
Ah!
Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?
Gee, you think?
!
I do.
Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.
You hit her!
What did I do?
You had my car towed.
You were parked in Howard's spot!
I was parked in Sheldon's spot!
Sheldon doesn't have a spot!
Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.
- Okay, let's go.
- I'll drive.
You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.
The tow truck didn't scratch your car.
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I did it!
Morning, Professor Stevens.
Don't look at that whiteboard.
That's my math, not your math.
Keep walking, nosey.
What the hell are you doing?
Oh You said I'm not using my space, so I'm using it.
Okay, you need to move now.
No, I don't.
You can't stay there forever.
Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can.
Give up, Wolowitz.
You've chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can't defeat.
There is nothing you could possibly do to-- Those aren't gonna help you, Sheldon!
Oh, yes, they are!
I mean, what?
!
I'm warning you, Sheldon!
Your threats are empty!
Nothing can move me!
Stop that!
Get out of my spot!
No.
You-- That's it.
I am calling campus security!
You prepare for the scolding of your life!
What are you idiots doing?
!
He's trying to kill me, Leonard!
Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence!
Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?
You're both acting like lunatics.
- It's just a parking spot.
- It's not just a parking spot!
He can't handle the fact that I'm a bigger deal than he is now.
Oh, preposterous!
I have been solely responsible for this university's six-loop quantum gravity calculations.
I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine.
Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.
Can you believe this guy?
What I don't believe is that you tried to run him over.
Oh, like you've never thought of doing that.
Don't hate me just because I lived the dream.
Hey.
Sweet ride!
What are you doing in there?
!
Just breaking in your new car.
Stop that!
You stop that!
You know what they say?
Revenge is a dish best served nude.
Hey, got a minute?
Oh, of course, come in.
This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.
C-calm down.
Howard has something he wants to say to you.
All right.
Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard-- Howard that's not how we practiced it.
I had no idea how much that spot meant to you.
Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it's not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I'll park in the structure across the street.
Well, Howard, thank you.
It's quite a gesture on your part.
You've shown yourself to be the bigger man.
Thank you.
Which I find totally unacceptable.
I must be the bigger man.
Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.
Wow, okay.
Well, thanks.
I don't know what to say.
There is nothing to say.
Except I'm the bigger man.
I'm not kidding.
Say it.
Just say it.
You're the bigger man, Sheldon.
Oh, stop.
And I believe this is yours.
FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.
I'd like to propose a toast to burying the hatchet.
To burying the hatchet.
You know, I'm kind of glad this happened.
Me, too.
In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.
Yeah, everybody's happy.
Great!
Can I help you?
Yes.
A-according to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood.
I believe I may have a similar problem.
This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle.
A what?
A naked man sat on it.
Now, here's my concern.
His diet is rich in fatty deli meats.
What test do you have to detect lipid residue?
Lipid what?
Lipid residue.
An anal autograph.
A colon calling card, if you will.
Tuesday okay?
Don't rush it.
We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.
Let me write you a ticket.
Is that your son?
Uh-huh.
Looks like that laptop's seen better days.
If you're interested, I'm selling this.
It-it's only two years old, Intel core, i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than an astronaut's penis.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?
Why would it trouble you?
It's, like, your third favorite cartoon theme song.
It is, right behind Do do-do do-do, Inspector Gadget and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Heroes in a half-shell WOLOWITZ and  Turtle power!
However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that "Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can".
Yeah, so?
I can think of many things Spider-Man can't do that a spider can.
One: crawl in your ear and die.
Two: legally leave Guatemala without a passport.
Three: have sex with a spider.
Can we change the subject?
Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.
It's "heebie-jeebies".
I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic.
Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight.
The theme: movies that killed their franchises.
Oh.
Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.
Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous.
I mean, you know a movie's bad when my homegirl Sandy B. can't save it.
Penny's working tonight; I'm in.
Not me.
I'm having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.
Fun.
We know how much you love that.
It's torture.
Especially with her dad.
We have nothing in common.
You know what I like to do when I'm forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station?
I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.
Thanks, Sheldon.
I'll try that with my father-in-law.
No, you can't use that one.
That's mine.
Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker.
Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the center of the earth and come up in China.
Great, thank you.
Actually, you can't have that one either.
It's too good.
Sorry.
What about you, Sheldon?
Do you have any plans tonight?
Sadly, yes.
Amy's taking me to a memorial service.
It's for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he'll never make his way back to China.
That should lighten the mood.
What can I say?
I put the "fun" in funeral.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
Amy.
Amy.
Oh, right, funeral.
: Amy.
Hello, Sheldon.
I'm not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?
I think I'm too sick to go to the funeral.
You're sick?
You poor kid.
Well, see ya.
Sheldon, aren't you gonna take care of me?
Me?
No.
No, I'm not that kind of doctor.
But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.
Oh, I see the confusion.
No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I'm ill.
When you're feeling better, you'll think that's funny.
Never mind.
Good night, Sheldon.
Amy.
Amy.
Amy.
I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this.
Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're welcome.
Now let's get this over with.
So, how have you been?
Fine.
Good.
Fine is good.
How you liking retirement?
It's fine.
I'm sensing a theme.
You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song?
How's that dinner coming?
I just put it in.
It's gonna be a while.
I like rare chicken.
Let's do this.
You could die.
Death by chicken.
That's a pretty "fowl" way to go.
Here's another beer, honey.
Thank you.
So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon.
How was it?
It was good.
Had no idea you were the chatty one.
Exactly what it was half an hour ago.
It's like you're not even trying to get better.
Sheldon, you don't get over the flu in half an hour.
Well, not with that attitude.
I have to say, I'm finding your bedside manner a little lacking.
I'm sorry.
I just want you to get better as soon as possible.
And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question.
Do you believe in the placebo effect?
Of course I do.
There have been many studies proving its validity.
Great.
Now, this may look like a Tic Tac but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.
Sheldon, this isn't helping.
Why don't you just let me get some rest.
How can you sleep?
I'm not done making you feel better.
I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.
Y-You want to rub something on my chest?
Yes.
All over it.
Maybe we should start with that.
Now you're being a responsible patient.
Now, you may notice some tingling.
Oh, I'm counting on it.
: Oh.
Okay, dig in.
Hold up.
Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Took the words right out of my mouth.
So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?
I'm going next weekend.
Oh, you like to fish?
Yes.
Sure.
I can hear it in your voice.
Oh, if he didn't like it, he wouldn't go.
You know, I hadn't thought of that.
: Help me.
Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime.
Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.
No, no.
We know each other well enough.
He's been talking my ear off all night.
Howie, I think you'd have fun.
Fine, you can tag along.
Terrific.
My two favorite fellas gone fishin'.
Well, hang on a second, Bernie.
Next weekend, we have that thing.
What thing?
You know, the thing.
Oh, that thing.
No, I cancelled that thing.
All right, it's settled.
You and I are going fishing.
Great.
: Thanks for the help.
I've never even been fishing.
This is gonna be a disaster.
If you don't want to look foolish doing something, you should practice.
Do you know how many beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over?
I'll give you a hint.
You can see them here, here and here.
Raj is probably right.
You should get someone to give you some pointers.
Do either of you guys know how to fish?
BOTH : No.
But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.
Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.
S'up?
Step one: worms.
Ew!
Okay, right there, "ew" is one of the things you're not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law.
It's right up there with "icky" and "get it away".
Now pick one up.
Really?
You're gonna have to do it when you're fishing.
Okay.
What are you waiting for?
I don't know, for them to die of natural causes.
Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.
Fine.
There.
I'm no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.
Fine.
Sorry, Mr. Worm.
Sherm.
Sherm the Worm.
Hey, don't name him.
Just jab a hook in his face.
- You got this, buddy.
- Yeah, come on, Howard.
- Hook that worm.
- You can do it.
That's great.
Cheerleading-- way to man things up.
"And the control group displayed "significantly fewer genetic abnormalities.
"But, because of flaws in the experimental design "relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after".
The end.
That was great.
Rub my chest again.
No.
I need to get you down for a nap.
For some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up.
How's the poor thing?
Oh, I'm hanging in there.
Thanks for asking.
Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab.
This is proving really good for congestion, but there's a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it-- happy thoughts.
Uh, I'm going to draw you a soothing bath.
Where's your bath thermometer?
I don't have a bath thermometer.
Fine.
Then I'm going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.
This is a really good expectorant.
Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.
: Okay, okay, here's the deal.
I don't need your medicine.
I'm not sick.
I don't understand.
I got better two days ago.
It's just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.
So you've just been lying to him?
See the stuff in my nose?
Rubber cement.
I don't mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.
All right.
I'll tell him.
Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?
I'll tell him tomorrow.
Mama needs a bath.
Now, let's assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish.
You're going to have to know how to gut it.
So, what you're going to do is you're going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly.
You want me to stop?
No, I'm fine.
Keep going.
All right.
Now, you don't want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face.
Oh, my God.
What is with you guys?
It's not our fault.
Our dads never did anything like this with us.
What, never?
My dad was an anthropologist.
The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy.
I hated that kid.
Mine just took me to his gynecology office.
I got so bored, I'd put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.
Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.
Yeah, okay, Howard wins.
You know, maybe we didn't have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there's a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.
You're right.
I should do this.
Great.
Here you go.
What you're going to do is you're going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.
Here we go.
Oh, look, it's a female.
You can see all the eggs.
: I'm walking on sunshine Whoa, oh And don't it feel good?
Oh, yeah And don't it feel good?
Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you're back.
Taking a turn for the worst.
I think I'm going to need another bath.
I'm surprised to hear that.
See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren't recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.
Oh?
I got the results back.
Have you developed any of the following symptoms?
A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region?
Also known as full-blown "liar, liar, pants on fire".
All right, all right.
But I really was sick at the beginning.
It's just been so nice having you take care of me.
It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy.
I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favor.
I feel terrible I did this.
It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behavior in the future.
I suppose that's fair.
What do you suggest?
In a perfect world, I'd lock you in a stockade in the public square.
That probably requires a permit.
I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.
Oh, that seems overly harsh.
You gave in to a hun weakness.
You didn't kill a man.
You know, it's a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.
Are you saying you want to spank me?
I don't want to.
But it looks like you left me no choice.
That's true.
I've been a very bad girl.
Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to fish we go.
That's what you're wearing?
No good?
The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.
Maybe in cartoons.
Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.
All right, let's hit the road.
I wouldn't mind shooting some ducks in the morning.
Wait, now we're shooting things?
I like using a big shell.
You can't eat them afterwards, but it's fun watching them blow up.
Sir, I'm flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don't think this trip is the way to do it.
And I can't return these things if there's chunks of duck all over them.
So, why'd you agree to come?
'Cause Bernadette made me.
I tried to back out, too.
My wife said I had to go.
Really?
Your wife makes you do stuff?
You're a big, scary cop.
You're an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she's only four feet tall.
So, what do we do now?
They expect us to go away for the weekend.
Ah  There's an Indian casino near Palm Springs.
You know how to shoot craps?
No, but I'm not a stranger to dice games.
I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.
Mazel tov.
I'll teach you how to play.
Really?
Thank you, sir.
Call me Mike.
Okay.
: Oh, boy, we're just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?
That's my wife and daughter you're talking about.
Great couple of gals.
I wouldn't go that far.
Are you prepared to receive your punishment?
One second.
I want to put on some music.
Why?
I don't want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.
Very well, then.
Get over my knee.
Let's begin.
Oh, my.
Excuse me.
You're not supposed to be enjoying this.
Then maybe you should spank me harder.
Maybe I will.
Ooh!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.
Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.
You're so butch.
Aw, I got a little paper cut.
Of course you did.
Your hands are softer than veal.
Oh, before I forget, Saturday I'm planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.
Really?
That's how you're gonna spend your Saturday night?
Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.
Oh, you poor thing.
Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?
Little bit, yeah.
Oh, great!
I've always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.
Yeah, oh, I'm sorry.
I should've mentioned this earlier.
You're not invited.
Why not?
Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.
By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?
Yeah, like a bunch of savages.
Saturday night?
But I've been working late all week.
That was gonna be our night.
But I have to go.
We play as a group.
If-if I'm not there, then everyone will blame you.
They'll be all, "Bernadette ruined everything.
She's the worst".
So, you see?
I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage.
You're an idiot.
I'm your idiot.
Forever.
So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but Leonard's talking about a big D and D game at his place.
Saturday night just went from crazy to epic!
Woo-hoo!
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
All right, Sheldon, to start our quest, you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.
A Christmas gift?
You know I don't enjoy Christmas.
What's wrong with Christmas?
Oh, where to begin?
Trees indoors.
Overuse of the words "'tis" and "'twas".
And the absurd custom of one stocking.
Everyone knows socks belong in pairs.
Who uses one sock?
Pirate with a peg leg?
Actually that helps, thank you.
Would you just look inside?
Oh, a scroll.
I like scrolls.
They're my third favorite system of transmitting the written word.
After stone tablets and skywriting.
"You have all been summoned to join "a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure.
"Your quest begins "in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred".
I like where this is heading.
"Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres".
Oh, that's a saucy twist.
"That leader's name: Santa Claus"" No, no, no!
It's actually, "Ho, ho, ho," but you'll get the hang of it.
Thought it'd be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.
Fun?
Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.
Okay, here we go.
"You find yourselves "in the smoking remains of Santa's village.
Clearly, a great battle has taken place".
Oh, man, the first monster I see, I'm gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass.
Do you hear yourself when you say these things?
Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow.
Sheldon, what do you do?
I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says, "Get a load of this guy".
Fine.
Howard, what do you do?
I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way.
And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.
Okay, guys, let's make a plan: spell casters in the back, warriors in the front No, screw that noise, I'm going in.
Hang on, Santa, I'm coming for you!
Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire  a cannon blows your face off, you die, you're out of the game.
But a canon?
Am I really out of the game?
Lucky.
Okay, come on, moving on.
Wait, doesn't anyone have a rod of resurrection?
Because if you've got one, I need it bad.
Get in here with your rod and give it to me.
Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud.
Hey, guys.
I don't mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you'd like to see what you're missing out on.
So  Bernadette?
Bernadette's wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21.
And there's Amy, showing all kinds of ankle.
In an outfit I'm assuming is from Forever 63.
And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.
I know they're making a rhetorical point, I just don't know what it is.
See you, boys.
We are going drinking.
Uh, wait, can I come with you?
My character died.
Sorry, Raj, it's girls' night out.
Maybe another time.
Okay Come on.
Ooh!
Girls' night, girls' night!
How does he not hear that?
So, what's the plan?
Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?
No!
No!
Geez, who's Forever 63 now?
Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table?
Don't worry.
It's my treat.
Thanks.
Wow!
You should come to girls' night more often.
And not just because if you weren't here, this would be a can of Pabst.
My pleasure; nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady.
Just ask my dog.
My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she's going to die of gout.
Hey, let's help Raj meet a girl tonight.
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?
Let's get him laid!
Stop it.
You're ruining girls' night.
Raj, you're a great guy, you're in a bar full of single women; let us help you.
Yeah, you're a real catch.
I know you're shy, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't have someone wonderful in your life.
That's sweet of you.
But what can you do to help?
We'll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you.
Okay.
Well, a couple of things.
Don't tell them I come from money.
I want them to love me for me.
They must be insanely hot.
Like, nines or tens.
Nines or tens?
Okay, an eight is acceptable if she's willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.
Bottom line: you'll take any woman who'll have you, right?
In a New Delhi minute.
I don't remember you buying these miniatures in my store.
Oh, uh, yeah.
I got 'em on Amazon.
Sure.
I get it.
Why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend?
I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet.
Have you seen my store?
The whole place is a toilet.
C-Can we please move this along?
Yeah, sorry.
Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest.
What do you do?
And, Howard, do not say, : "I feel up the large chest".
Excuse me, I'm a married man now.
I wasn't going to say anything so juvenile.
Great.
What do you do?
I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go .
I open the chest.
It's locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.
That's not good.
My character and I both have claustrophobia.
Glowing letters appear on the chest that read, "If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory".
Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?
Walls are getting closer.
Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.
Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.
You're ten seconds away from getting crushed!
Nine, eight What are we supposed to do?
seven, six Wait, wait.
Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.
Never heard of it.
Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.
three, two Somebody sing the damn song!
Good King Wenceslas looked out On the feast of Stephen When the snow lay 'round about Deep and crisp and even The walls are getting slower.
Brightly shone the moon that night Though the frost was cru-el When a poor man came in sight Gath'ring winter fu-el The walls stop!
You're safe!
That was amazing, Sheldon.
How did you know that?
It was simple.
I combined a well-known, historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.
Okay, continuing our quest.
W-W-Wait.
There's still four more verses.
You don't sing a song and not finish it.
Hither, page, and stand by me If thou know'st it, telling Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost Looks like he's doing pretty good.
Of course he is.
Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend.
She's angry, she's drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire.
I mean That is some low-hanging fruit.
Oh, here he comes.
So, how'd it go?
Great.
I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address.
Ooh!
"Jennifer@not-even-if-you-were- the-last-guy-on-earth.
loser"" What?
I'm sorry, Raj.
Why can't I find someone?
I'm smart, I've got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can't.
Oh, honey, it's not you, it's them.
No, it's not.
She was too beautiful for me.
Why would you say that?
It's true.
I'm always attracted to women I can't have.
I do it all the time.
I did the same thing with the two of you.
The two of them?
I don't understand.
Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me.
But apparently I misread those signals.
And you liked Bernadette also?
That was before Penny.
I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends' girlfriends at a time.
I'm very old-fashioned that way.
So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too.
No, not really.
Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?
Not that I can think of.
Think harder.
Nope.
I guess the heart wants what the heart wants.
Or in this case, doesn't.
I mean, at all.
What?
Ye who now will bless the poor Shall yourselves find blessing Ba-da-bum.
Done?
I think the word you're looking for is "bravo".
Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.
Melted snowmen?
Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?
I don't know.
What's the difference?
It's a game of the imagination, Leonard.
Paint a picture.
Fine.
You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.
There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.
What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?
You see those, too.
Oh, it's like I'm really there.
I gotta tell you, this-this is the most holiday fun I've had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.
Good story.
What are you drinking there?
Little eggnog?
Yes.
What, is there a problem?
No, it's nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage.
Pretty Christmasy.
Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink?
Eggs are available all year 'round.
I've been known to enjoy this poolside.
Come on, Sheldon.
You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you've got an eggnog mustache going on there.
Just admit it.
You're getting a little Yuletide spirit.
Oh, don't be silly.
Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry.
Why is this so important to you?
Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I'm tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.
What was so bad about them?
I grew up in a house full of crazy academics.
Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper.
And in the morning, you could tell he'd been there because the paper would be graded.
No wonder you love Christmas.
That sounds amazing.
It wasn't amazing.
I got a C-minus four years in a row.
Yeah, I'm familiar with your work.
C-minus was your gift.
Amy, I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
It's fine.
I'm used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice.
I didn't have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so I'd give him back his insulin.
Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.
Forget it.
I don't expect you guys to understand.
I understand.
In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar.
She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me.
You think that's bad?
In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.
Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I'm holding hands with another person.
I do that, too.
Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel.
And I let it.
It's kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.
It is, isn't it?
But you're not alone anymore.
Now you've got Sheldon.
I do.
And don't worry, someday you'll have somebody, too.
Thank you.
I hope she's half as lovely and amazing as you are.
Thank you, Rajesh.
He wants me, I'm good.
We can go now.
Damn it.
What?
Now that I know she doesn't like me, I'm kind of into her.
All right.
I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.
Great.
Let's do it.
The drawbridge is lowering.
My carpal tunnel's acting up.
Play through the pain!
You did it!
The drawbridge is down.
You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room.
And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus.
He says, "Ho, ho, help me".
Yes, we found Santa!
Christmas is saved!
Don't ever tell my mother I said that.
I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.
But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.
Wait, what are you doing?
You can't talk; you're paralyzed.
I get right up in Santa's big, fat face and say Well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again.
Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn't that right?
Uh, okay.
My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas.
And I told you "my Pop-Pop," because that was the year my grandfather died.
I missed him and I wanted him back.
This is weird, right?
Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science.
But you didn't bring him back, did you?
Instead, I got Lincoln Logs.
Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain't one of 'em.
And now you're here asking me for something-- to save you.
Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today's not your day.
I'm leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones.
I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!
Okay.
So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa's dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.
Santa?
Oh, hello, Sheldon.
You should be asleep.
Well, then, you shouldn't have jingle bells on your boots.
Oh I've been wanting to talk to you.
I'm sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy.
I-I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn't one of them.
I understand.
But I-I do have something special for you.
Close your eyes.
Oh, I hope it's a train.
Oh, it's better than a train.
Two trains?
Better.
I'm getting three trains.
Okay, open 'em.
This is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres!
Wait, uh, uh, hang on.
I-In my defense Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was skeptical.
I can't blame you-- Tiny Twister was a complete bust.
No, I was wrong.
The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice.
I've never felt so alive.
Oh, hello, Alex.
Uh, let me go get you last night's recordings.
What recordings?
Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep?
Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it's probably pure gold.
So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call "Sheldon After Dark".
Hey, Leonard.
Hey.
Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.
Oh, I know-- I'm the one who had to buy him the helmet.
So, do you have any plans this weekend?
Well, most of Saturday's gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we're done.
How about you?
Oh, I'm gonna go see Kip Thorne give a lecture on subatomic space-time.
Ooh.
That's his take on John Wheeler's quantum foam.
That should be great.
Well, if you want, you can come with me.
Ah, I'd love to, but I'm supposed to hang out with Penny.
Well, bring her.
Well, she's not really into that kind of stuff.
Yeah, okay.
Well, if you want to hear about the lecture, I can tell you all about it at work, or, you know, over dinner sometime.
What?
Giant Jenga, I win!
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
Oh, come on, that can't be true.
I did the research-- Tony the Tiger, Dig'em the Frog, Cap'n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop.
Not one cereal mascot is a girl.
It's a total breakfast sausage fest.
Are we done with this?
Almost-- Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.
Terrific.
Something weird happened and I don't know what to do about it.
What's going on?
Sheldon's assistant asked me on a date last night.
How could you do that to me?
You know I've been working it with Alex for weeks.
Working it?
You can't even talk to her.
I talk with my eyes.
You look like my little cousin when he's dropping one in his diaper.
She knows I have a girlfriend.
It's so weird.
Oh, my God.
You're loving this.
To my bones.
I mean, I'm not gonna do anything about it.
I love Penny.
It's just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.
I both hate you and want to be you.
This is Ryan Gosling all over again.
Aw, gentlemen.
What is on the conversational menu this morning?
Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.
I didn't steal anyone.
Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.
Well, that's not acceptable.
I'm her boss.
She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.
I'm androgynous?
Oh, please.
Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.
What do you guys think I should do?
I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.
I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice.
Uh, in the past, I've reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies.
What is happening?
I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation.
Uh, to protect those involved, I'll be changing their names.
Who's involved?
Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate.
Let's call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.
You're talking about Leonard.
No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy.
Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.
It's your assistant Alex, isn't it?
No.
Not No.
This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.
Wait, what the hell's going on with Leonard and Alex?
No, I'm sorry.
Who's talking about Leonard and Alex?
W Fine.
Ricardo and Tondelaya.
Okay, look, it's not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya.
It is really about her boss, who doesn't quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm He's usually pretty smart about these things.
I'm gonna kill her.
I'm sure you've got nothing to worry about.
Leonard would never cheat on you.
She's right.
But say the word-- I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose.
One of them could end up in the backseat of her car.
Or her shower.
Ladies, ladies, please.
We're not here to talk about Penny, okay?
We're here to talk about me.
Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainst Oh, darn it!
All right, I guess the cat's out of the bag.
Let me explain what's going on-- Ricardo is really Leonard We know what's going on, Sheldon!
Well, what should I do?
Well, Alex is your employee.
If she's doing something that's making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.
Oh, no, he's not uncomfortable at all.
No, he's loving it.
Yeah, he's strutting around like he's five-foot-six.
What He's loving it?
Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.
Talk to her?
That's all you've got?
With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper's Council of Ladies, I really expected more.
Give me back the T-shirts.
Alex check my schedule.
What does my afternoon look like?
I think it's pretty wide open.
Oh, wait.
Here's something at 4:00.
"Give Alex a talking to"?
Well, that snuck up on us, didn't it?
Is there a problem?
Let's not call it a problem.
Let's call it an opportunity.
To solve a serious problem.
What did I do?
You don't know?
Oh, you poor dear.
Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don't even know which way is up.
You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.
What?
I didn't make a sexual advance on anybody.
Now, there's no need to get defensive.
I'm not unsympathetic to your plight.
My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.
What?
Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.
This conversation is making me uncomfortable.
Yeah, you and me both, sister.
Now, please understand I don't hold you responsible for your behavior because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you're a slave to your desire to reproduce.
But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases?
Let's see here.
Oh, yes.
Check out this oozy doozy.
I have to go.
So does this fellow, but he can't without it burning like hot soup.
Hey, pretty lady.
Oh, you seem extra happy.
Uh, I guess I am.
Any particular reason why?
Mm, I don't know, just having a good day.
This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio-- that was pretty crazy.
Mm-hmm.
Anything else?
Mm.
I found this quiz online called "Which Star Trek Character Are You"?
and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.
That's great.
: Oh.
It.
Was.
Hmm.
Well, I'm glad you're having such a great day.
Yeah.
And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.
Oh, and who's that?
What do you mean?
Oh, I just didn't know if you meant me or Alex.
Um, why would I mean Alex?
Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it!
What?
Don't play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!
I'm missing something.
Did you say something to Penny about Alex?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me.
All she did was get mad at you.
Why would you do that?
I needed advice about a woman.
I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it's that you can't tell a uterus from a unicycle.
At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.
Good to know.
Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies.
Hello.
I see.
Uh, what time?
Very well, then.
Huh.
That was the Human Resources Department at the university.
Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behavior in the workplace.
Oh, my God, what did you do?
Hmm, let me think.
Nothing.
I'm a delight.
Human Resources Department.
Human Resources Department.
Human Resources Department.
Come in.
Hello.
Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.
Thank you.
I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.
So I've been told.
But I can't understand what she has to complain about.
I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history.
There's string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that's for anyone.
Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.
Cancel my next appointment.
This is gonna take a while.
Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.
Like what?
Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an "egg salad sandwich".
I don't even know what that means, but I'm gonna go ahead and tell you you can't say it.
Oh!
I see the confusion here.
No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out.
No.
I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know?
Even you.
You're a slave.
I'm a what?
Well, y-you I-I'm just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman's menstrual cycle Whuh-ah!
You can't talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper.
Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I'm gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.
I d I don't see why I'm the one being persecuted here.
Dr. Hofstadter-- he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen.
You know, and Howard Wolowitz-- he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot.
Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as "Brown Sugar".
Hofstadter Wolowitz and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?
Yes.
No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn't racist.
He's also brown.
: I'm sorry Alex hit on me Hit on me Hit on me Sorry Alex Hit on me, I'd no idea I'm cute.
Oh, damn it, you are.
Please forgive me.
I should have told you about Alex.
I don't care about Alex.
Fine, I care.
Okay, I hate that bitch.
But what really hurt is that you liked it so much.
I mean, do I need to be worried?
Of course not.
No.
Why?
Because she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn't have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.
You do that?
No.
Hang on.
Are you feeling insecure?
Because that's my thing, and if you take it away, I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship.
Yes, Leonard, I am insecure.
Happy?
No, I'm not happy.
Why are you smiling?
I'm sorry.
I just never think of you having feelings like that.
Well, I do.
Why?
Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.
Good.
: Come here.
I'll tell you a secret?
What's that?
With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.
Can I tell you a secret?
Sure.
Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we're all gonna stop.
: Message received.
Ah, excuse me.
Hello.
This is Dr. Hofstadter.
Okay.
All right, thank you.
That's weird.
I'm getting called in to Human Resources.
What did you do?
I don't know.
Huh.
I just got called in to Human Resources.
Why?
I don't know.
Huh.
That is so strange.
Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.
Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes?
I have a problem here.
Do you really think you should be drinking right now?
How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?
I don't know.
Seek professional help?
I did.
The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.
Wait, you got called in, too?
What is going on?
Sheldon threw us all under the bus.
Oh.
I feel like I've been called down to the principal's office.
Although I wouldn't mind if Brown Sugar suspended me.
From a sex swing!
This may have been a mistake.
Relax.
Everything's gonna be fine.
You know, before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day.
Uh, little tip: turn off your "I Like Big Butts" ringtone before you go in.
Well, this is all your fault.
How is this my fault?
If you weren't screwing around with Sheldon's assistant, none of this would be happening.
I wasn't screwing around with anyone.
Oh, of course not.
She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.
Ah, Mr. Wolowitz, it's been a while.
Hey, Janine.
How are Tom and the kids?
Fine.
You must be Dr. Hofstadter.
Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.
Yeah, yeah, me, too.
I didn't do anything.
Is that alcohol on your breath?
Howard built a sex robot.
That is not true.
All I did was build a robot.
Did it have six breasts?
I'm sorry, I'm a feminist--  I don't notice things like how many breasts a robot has.
Well, hello.
What are you doing here?
Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.
And I'm a little busy right now.
But I came to file a complaint.
Yeah, somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.
And who was that?
You, you dirty birdie.
I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I'm deeply offended.
Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.
That's it.
All of you, in my office now!
And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you're menstruating.
And based on your behavior, I don't have to.
It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn't happen in the future.
Okay.
Yeah.
Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so um, I'm gonna need you to take it for me.
Oh, and, uh, you'd better ace it-- they're pretty mad.
So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.
Oh, would you stop worrying about that?
I can't help it.
But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it.
So I got a course catalog at school and looked at some of the science classes.
That's great.
No, it isn't-- they are extremely boring.
I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day?
Anyway, I decided I don't need to be a scientist, I could just look like one.
So I bought these.
Glasses?
Mm-hmm.
I really don't think that's gonna change-- oh, my God, you look so smart and hot!
I know, right?
Watch this.
Molecules.
Okay, come with me.
Where are we going?
To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses and maybe the boots.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hey, will you steam my uniform next?
Yeah, w Interesting.
Do you recall this conversation?
"Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer"?
"No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer".
Looks like that rumpled chicken's come home to roost.
Hi.
Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.
Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.
Damn, you've got more makeup than I do.
You've got better makeup than I do.
Yeah, I'm borrowing this.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is my Comic-Con makeup.
I love you, but there are some things a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.
That's a wise policy.
I once borrowed my sister's makeup for a costume contest.
Got a terrible case of pinkeye.
Yeah, but luckily, I was going as a zombie.
I won second place.
I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.
That was San Diego Comic-Con.
This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.
Is that better?
Well, it's a lot smaller.
It's more about the comic books.
The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.
So to answer your question, no, it's not better.
Well, then why are you going?
It's a comic book convention.
You know, it's like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one's still pretty good.
All right.
Well, you guys have fun.
I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, hang on a second.
Hold this.
What was that for?
To show people when they don't believe me.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
Oh, this is the best.
You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem.
You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.
Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch.
He can't stand being at a table where one person's having an omelet and another person's having a sandwich.
He's not exhausting at all.
Oh.
It's Leonard.
he says they're on the road and headed for Bakersfield at "warp speed".
Maybe it's the mimosa, but I'm gonna give the kid an LOL.
It's cute how excited they are.
You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.
When did Howard learn to sew?
When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom's pants out.
I don't even understand why they go to these conventions.
I know.
The four of them work at a major university.
They're all super smart.
How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?
I don't mind it.
I think Howie's just in touch with his inner child.
Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pajamas, sometimes it feels like I'm touching his inner child.
It's probably because they were bullied growing up.
In a world where you can't fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.
Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids.
Although, in my defense, if Danny Biffle didn't want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn't have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.
I've never even read a comic book.
You guys?
Uh-uh.
No.
I mean, it's such an important part of their lives.
Maybe we should try reading some.
Seriously?
The comic book store isn't far from here.
That is an amazing idea.
Okay, how many of these have I had?
I think you should turn on the GPS.
It is on.
But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on.
I know I'd feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option.
I love the turn-by-turn voice option.
Has it really only been ten miles?
I'm turning it on, but just to shut you up.
Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.
Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he's talking about.
I'd put on my listening ears if I were you.
What did you do?
I found a hack online.
I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.
That is so cool.
Counterpoint, no, it's not.
Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles.
Here's an interesting fact about interstates.
Really?
Shh, he said it's interesting.
Interstates are numbered as follows.
Even-numbered routes run east and west, odd-numbered routes run north and south.
Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses or spurs.
Look, Leonard, there's a bridge.
Drive off it.
You know, we're not that far from Vazquez Rocks.
Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.
We've got our costumes in the trunk.
We could go there and have a little photo shoot.
Great idea.
I haven't had a carbohydrate in two weeks.
These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they're gone.
Yeah, that sounds fun.
Oh, smashing.
Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?
No.
Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.
Recalculating.
While we're waiting, do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law?
The answer, coming up in 14 miles.
None of you will get it.
It's Eisenhower.
Why are they staring?
Who cares?
Just soak it in.
Hello, boys.
Oh, hey.
Could you please stop staring?
They're just girls.
It's nothing you haven't seen in movies or in drawings.
Hey, Stuart.
Wh-What brings you guys here?
We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.
Oh, well, I recommend you don't open a store and sell them.
No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we'd give it a try.
Oh, okay.
What do you think you might be into?
Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga-- I swear I will turn a hose on you.
What kind of comics do the guys like?
Um, a litt bit of everything.
Mostly superhero stuff.
All right, well, who's the best superhero?
Shh!
You can't ask a question like that in here.
Are you trying to start a rumble?
Well, what do you recommend?
Well, uh, let's see.
You've got your basic clean-cut good guys-- Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America.
Then you have your darker anti-heroes-- your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.
Ooh, I do love a bad boy.
As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.
If I were you, I'd go for Fables number one.
The artwork is sophisticated, it's intelligently written, and it doesn't objectify or stereotype women.
Ooh, Thor!
He's hot.
Yeah, he kind of is.
And we're blending, and we're blending, and we're done.
I know Mr. Data isn't supposed to smile, but here it comes.
Come on, guys.
Let's do this.
Yeah, I'm sweating my bald cap off.
So what's our first pose going to be?
I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.
I'll set the timer.
Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?
Mr. Data's weapon is his mind.
I'm wielding it.
Phasers on the Borg!
Charlie's Angels.
Okay, what's next?
Now let's do some sexy glamour shots.
I'll set the mood.
Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz.
Yeah, nice one.
Oontz, oontz, oontz.
That's right.
Oontz, oontz, oontz.
Oh, my God.
Leonard, someone's stealing your car!
What?
Hey, hey!
Come back here!
Stop!
Stealing is against the law!
I don't believe this.
Son of a bitch.
I'll call 911.
Wha Oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.
Oh, so is mine.
Mine, too.
Anybody got any ideas?
Nope.
The only thing left to do now is assign blame.
Nice going.
What kind of a person steals another person's car in broad daylight?
What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?
I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali's fault.
You're right.
Nice going.
Car.
What is wrong with people?
Why don't they stop?
Maybe we're better off.
What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?
Look at us, Sheldon.
We're the crazy people.
Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.
Good idea.
Why don't you get started on that?
Come on, let's just start walking.
There's got to be a gas station or something nearby.
What, you think just because you're wearing a captain's uniform, you're in charge?
Yes.
All right.
Hmm, okay, I'm done.
How did you guys finish so fast?
I don't know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word "brakkadoom"!
Yeah, well, I have street smarts.
So, what'd you guys think?
Well, there was a lot of action, Mmm.
and the story moved along at a brisk pace.
It was, overall what's the word I'm looking for?
Stupid?
So stupid.
I don't know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.
It's crazy; they spend hours arguing about things that don't even exist.
What a waste of time.
I know.
A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?
I don't think it's heavy.
It's some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it.
That makes even less sense, I mean No, no, no, it doesn't.
Thor is a god.
The hammer is his; only he can use it.
It's like Sheldon and his toothbrush.
Or his thin, beckoning lips.
Okay, hang on, what if Thor's hand is on the hammer?
I mean, if he's touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?
No.
Yes.
Well, which is it?
Maybe we missed something.
Let's read it again.
Okay.
Yeah.
You want some tea?
Good idea.
I'll help you.
Wait, I thought we were reading.
We are.
We're just, uh, giving you a head start.
I wish my mom was here.
We could all hang out in her shadow.
Wool pants in the desert.
I feel like I've got poached testicles.
Oh, you poor thing; you're sweating.
That's so much worse than having your car stolen.
Insurance is gonna buy you a new car.
It's not gonna de-funk my junk.
Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching.
We're Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.
Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.
Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love.
And look at us.
At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie.
As long as we have those things, - nothing can stop - Nerds!
I hate this planet.
It says right here on the hammer, "Whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor".
Hold on, who decides who's worthy?
Does the hammer decide?
Yes!
No!
It can't decide.
It's a hammer.
You said it's a magic hammer.
Yeah, it can't make decisions.
If Harry Potter's wand can make decisions, why can't Thor's hammer?
Okay, if you're going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can't even take you seriously.
Hello.
Hello.
Uh, four glasses of water, please.
Anything for you guys?
Can I use your phone?
Our car got stolen.
Why don't you ask Scotty to beam you up?
Scotty was on the original series, and we're Next Generation.
So joke's on you.
We're not with him.
You can't pick something up in outer space.
In space, there is no up.
Oh, yeah?
Then how does the sun come "up" every day?
Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.
Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall.
Why don't we go look at those?
Oh, great!
Yes!
And then you will see.
I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment.
Yeah, that's right, the slow reader used science.
Suck on that.
Was there anything valuable in the car?
Our clothes, our wallets, phones.
And about $300 worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.
Makeup?
Sure.
Uh, we're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield.
They have a big costume contest.
It's cooler than it sounds.
I don't know, sounds pretty cool.
I-It is.
It's not just comic books.
They've got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party Okay, he gets how cool it is.
I think I have all I need here.
You guys need me to call someone?
I'm guessing your moms?
Thanks, but we've got it covered.
Okay, I just talked to my mom.
She arranged for us to get a rental car.
Great.
We can still make it to Comic-Con.
Are you kidding me?
After all we've been through, I just want to go home.
Don't be like that.
Come on, Howard, talk to him.
I'm with Leonard.
I'm done.
Fine, then I guess it's two against two.
How do we decide?
Actually, it's three against one.
What?
!
What about the mission?
You said we were a real-life landing party.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We're an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we're idiots.
And to tell you the truth, I'm starting to feel like one.
I want to go home now.
Okay.
Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise?
Get it?
Enterprise?
Screw you.
That's funny.
Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?
Yeah?
Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.
No.
Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.
Okay, hang on.
If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?
Did that ever happen?
Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?
Well, I say that's the last time we ever go outside.
Look, right here.
Red Hulk is picking up Thor's hammer 'cause Thor's touching it.
No, it's because they're in space.
He's really just touching the strap.
The strap is part of the hammer!
No, it's not!
Are they actually arguing about comic books?
No, that can't be right.
Maybe "Thor's Hammer" is a new color of nail polish.
Then Red Hulk must be worthy.
How could Red Hulk be worthy?
You don't know his life!
There's only one logical explanation.
Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.
If it's an alternate dimension sounds like a job for a landing party.
Captain, what are your orders?
I say we investigate.
Wait.
They might be hostile.
Fine, but set them to stun.
If we vaporize Penny, I'll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.
Fun fact: President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act from his hospital room.
Wow, that is interesting.
You learn something new every day.
Say, can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system?
Ooh, another quiz.
Yes!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Sheldon, your food's getting cold.
I'll eat later.
Right now, I'm suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.
It's hot when Sheldon talks dirty.
So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you.
How awesome is that?
Oh, let me see.
Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe.
You can even choose your accessories.
Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.
Oh, this is neat.
Think about all the action figures we've bought over the years.
It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us.
Don't you think?
Yeah, if that's your idea of what's cool, you should get one.
Yeah, so, I'm out.
What do you think, Sheldon?
Want an action figure that looks just like you?
Would it come with kung-fu grip?
No.
Don't waste my time.
You get that these are personalize action figures.
Honey, if you want one, just get one.
You're still out, right?
Yep.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board.
He makes his move.
He's dividing both sides by "I".
He's adding back the coefficient.
He has a value for "P".
He's plugging that back in.
He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation.
The crowd goes wild.
Nobel!
Nobel!
Cooper?
Nobel.
Kripke.
Don't look at my board.
What's that?
That's a drawing of a really cool train.
Don't look at that, either.
What do you want?
I have some bad news.
You're working on a grant proposal for a new fusion reactor.
I'm working on a grant proposal for a new fusion reactor.
The university is only allowed to submit one proposal.
So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out.
That's hard cheese, Barry.
You're one of the good ones.
No, they're making us work together.
That's ridiculous.
I am one of the great minds of our generation.
I work on a level so rarified you couldn't even imagine it.
I said stop looking at my cool train!
Hmm.
Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.
Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife.
And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.
They're here.
Our action figures have arrived.
This is the best $500 I've ever spent.
$1,000 on action figures?
How can you afford that?
Easy-- his family's loaded, and Bernadette has a great job.
My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.
Say hello to an exact scale model of me.
Oh, I'm not dark chocolate.
I'm melt-in-your-mouth caramel.
Oh, man.
Look at my nose.
Maybe it's a shipping problem.
What?
Yeah.
Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.
This sucks.
I can't believe I wasted all that money.
Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn't let me get one.
Look at my face.
Do I look smug?
I feel smug.
I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.
Well, sometimes there's a secret ending, like in The Avengers.
Yeah, but I don't think that's going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.
They could show bloopers.
Oh, no.
What is that?
That is Sheldon's "I'm unhappy and about to destroy the planet" music.
Come on, let's just go to your place.
Well, wait, if he's unhappy, shouldn't we talk to him?
"Shouldn't we talk to him"?
Have you learned nothing in six years?
You doing okay, sweetie?
There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head.
I don't know where you're from, but where I'm from, that means I'm not doing okay.
Want me to make you some tea?
Tea is for when I'm upset.
I'm not upset.
The university's forcing me to work with Kripke.
I'm outraged.
So, cocoa?
Yes, cocoa.
Do you have any idea what it's like to be paired with someone who's so incredibly annoying?
Oh, teacher!
Me!
Me!
See, I did all this great work, and now he's just going to come along and ruin it.
I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.
What beverage do you make for that?
Oh no, no, no, I know this.
Uh hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?
Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!
What the frig, Cooper?
We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.
And yet, now you're in my office.
Point: Cooper.
Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.
We agreed to exchange copies of our work.
Let me see yours.
Why don't you show me yours first.
You think I just fell off the turnip truck?
We exchange at the same time.
How do I know you're not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
How do I know you're not going to do that with mine?
Yeah, because I'm not interested in getting published in Mad magazine.
Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.
Are we going to do this or not?
Thank you.
So, we read each other's work, meet again tomorrow?
Fine.
Nice try.
This is blank paper.
And I am sure it's still more valuable than whatever's in here.
Cough it up, Cooper.
Very well.
If this one's blank, too, I'm going to be furious.
Fine.
You!
Always bet on black.
Get that waste of money out of my face.
It's only a waste of money if we don't play with them.
He's right, dawg.
Please, I'm working.
You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.
Oh, yeah?
How's that?
Two words: Wait, maybe it's three words.
No, hang on.
Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen.
I have always wanted a 3-D printer.
Of course you have.
They're an engineer's dream.
Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.
Yeah, but they're so expensive.
Oh, come on.
You deserve one.
You've worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.
Well, the prices have been coming down.
Oh, true.
They're practically giving them away.
You know, in exchange for money.
And we can make stuff we need for work with it.
Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin' dream house.
We don't need Malibu Koothrappali's dream house.
Really, smart guy?
Where's he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?
The monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe.
I'm supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it's hard because now he reminds me of my uncle.
You've been awfully quiet tonight.
Is everything okay?
I'm fine.
All right, well, how was work today?
Did you exchange your research with Kripke?
Yes.
Sheldon, what's going on?
I read his research, and it's leaps and bounds ahead of mine.
Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought.
It's his mommy.
Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.
May I offer you a consoling hug?
What do we have to lose?
How's that?
I feel like I'm being strangled by a boa constrictor.
Why'd you stop?
Come on, Sheldon!
We're going to be late!
I can't go in today.
I'm sick.
You're not sick.
You just don't want to face Kripke.
No, look.
See?
What did you do, put this in your tea?
Oh, dear.
Now I'm not even smarter than you.
Sheldon, Kripke's not smarter than you.
You just got stuck on a wrong path.
Happened to Einstein.
He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.
Oh, don't play the Einstein card.
His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything.
So everything was a great breakthrough.
Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense.
Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.
All right, geez.
What a grouch.
How did I do that?
I got to remember how I did that.
Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?
I think this thing was made in China.
Eh, what can you do?
Ooh, I-I think it's done.
It worked!
We printed a whistle.
Amazing.
You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.
And we made it in only three hours.
Sounds just like store-bought.
Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.
Oh, I wish I was in better shape.
Stop holding your stomach in.
I'll give you a six-pack with the computer.
Oh, okay, great.
Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.
All right, you can suck it in a little bit.
Cooper, we have a problem.
Your work is really not at a level I expected it to be.
I know.
Go ahead, mock me.
Just use small words so I understand.
Don't play dumb with me.
We both know what your problem is.
We do?
You have a girlfriend.
So?
So my work would suffer, too, if I was getting laid all the time.
Yes.
That is the reason.
My work is suffering because of all the laid I'm getting.
You lucky bastard.
What can I say, you know?
She enjoys my genitals.
I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.
Okay, stop bragging.
You had some brilliant insights in here, but if we're gonna make this work, you need to buckle down and focus.
I'll do what I can.
But it's not going to be easy, because when I'm with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together boy howdy, is it magic Oh, good, you're home.
Got a little surprise for you.
What?
Say hello to my little friend.
Oh, my God.
That's so cute.
I didn't think there could be a smaller version of you.
I know, right?
And, thanks to photographs and a little here comes the bride.
Oh, Howie, I love these.
I thought you might.
Were they expensive?
Didn't cost a thing.
I made them myself.
How?
Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.
$5,000 for a couple of dolls?
Are you out of your mind?
Not just a couple of dolls.
For as many dolls as we want.
And whistles.
At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?
It's kind of dawning on me now.
I don't believe you!
Howie, we can't afford to waste money on junk like this.
What are you talking about?
We make plenty of money.
I make plenty of money!
You make peanuts!
Yes, but we're married now.
That means, when you get sick, I take care of you.
And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff.
Sorry if you don't like it, but that's how love works.
No, here's how love works.
You're gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those.
Oh, my God!
Are you actually thinking about it?
All right, I don't understand.
Why didn't you just tell Kripke the truth?
Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good.
Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.
Is my coitus whimsically inventive?
That is what I write on the bathroom walls.
"For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter".
I know you're joking, but I'd be okay with that.
Yeah.
Sheldon, can I ask you a question?
Of course.
You ever going to sleep with Amy?
That's awfully personal.
We don't ask Sheldon things like that.
Maybe you don't; I do.
What's the deal?
Well, word around the university is I'm giving her sex organs a proper jostling.
All right, come on, be serious.
Look, you guys have been going out a long time.
She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?
All right, we're down the rabbit hole.
What are you doing?
Well, first of all, I'm quite fond of Amy.
Then what's the problem?
Penny all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others-- hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams.
But I'm working on it, you know?
Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy's chest.
A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.
Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.
Okay.
Hang on.
Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?
It's a possibility.
Oh, my God!
Sheldon, I know this wasn't easy for you, and I'm really glad we could have this conversation.
Oh, yeah.
Ow!
Are you sure you want to do this?
Give up your half of the 3-D printer?
Yes.
And can you please make that out to Bernadette?
I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.
Wow, that's harsh.
Tell me about it.
Aren't you gonna eat lunch?
Nah, I blew my food allowance on PokÃ©mon cards.
Well, the equation balances, but it's certainly not elegant.
Whatever.
You get any last night?
Yes.
Gave it to her good, huh?
No, I gave it to her well.
Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Was she naked, or was she wearing lingerie?
I didn't notice.
How could you not notice?
I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.
Ah, you're killing me, Cooper!
Can we get back to work?
Sure, sure, sure.
You guys ever use any toys?
Toys?
I do have a model rocket next to my bed.
A rocket?
You're a freak!
I love it!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
I don't know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long.
These are great.
I just started number six.
That's a good one.
Dumbledore dies in that one.
Yeah, I know, I didn't see it coming, either.
Why would you say that?
You brought up the subject.
I contributed an interesting fact on that subject.
It's called the art of conversation.
Okay, your turn.
That was a huge spoiler.
Good.
What is wrong with you?
If I did that, you'd bitch about it for weeks.
Oh, really, Leonard?
Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?
Hissy fits?
I have hissy fits?
Yes, and I have a theory why.
Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk.
Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds.
I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.
You are unbelievable.
I don't know why I put up with you.
You're controlling, you're irritating There you go again-- nag, nag, nag.
You're only proving my point, little lady.
You know what?
Screw you, Sheldon.
You are the most annoying person I have ever met.
What?
I'm annoying?
You criticize my behavior all the time.
"Sheldon, don't talk about your bowel movements over breakfast".
"Sheldon, when the president of the university "is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don't yawn and point at your watch".
"Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts 'cause you think they're ugly".
You're impossible.
That's it.
I don't I don't have to put up with this.
Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do.
Aw.
Here's what I think of your roommate agreement.
You pick that up right now.
No.
Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5: The roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground.
I don't care.
I don't have to do anything you say because I don't think I want to live here anymore.
Where are you going?
To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard.
Crazy bastard?
Yes.
Leonard, wait.
What?
Dobby the elf dies in book seven.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
Here you go.
Great.
Come on in.
What, you don't say thank you?
It's my suitcase.
I lent it to you two years ago.
Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle.
So, is everyone from Bernadette's company going to Vegas?
No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs.
It's part of a bonus she got.
Cool.
Did she discover a cure for something?
Not exactly.
They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.
Is there a good anal leakage?
Anyway, it was Bernie's idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.
Way to make lemonade.
You know, from around the corner where fudge is made.
Hey, I got a favor to ask.
Sure.
My mom's been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.
Dumped her?
What, did he use a forklift?
Sorry.
There's nothing funny about morbid obesity.
She's huge.
It was funny.
Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she's doing okay.
Dude, I'm a single man.
Saturday night is my party night.
Really?
What do you got going on?
I don't know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.
Okay, tell me if this sounds familiar.
You pay $15 to park, you stand on the sidewalk for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer You push your way to the bar, where you drink an $18 cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together.
Your children, grandchildren.
Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua.
Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callender's, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.
What time should I be at your mother's?
I told her around 7:00.
I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met.
Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple.
Like Burt and Ernie.
You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.
Well, I've had it.
I am done.
I can't I can't live with him for one more minute.
Wow.
Where are you going to go?
I was thinking here with you.
Oh.
That a problem?
No, not at all.
No, it's-it's great.
It's terrific.
I You know, I just can't help feel bad about Sheldon.
I mean how's he going to get by without you?
Ernie.
He's got Amy now.
Yeah, he does, but it's not the same.
Why?
Um Well, um, all right.
You-you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn't abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron's sister?
Harry and Ginny get together?
Sorry.
Spoiler alert.
My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can't do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.
Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his-his stooge, his doormat.
Well, you know what they say: if it ain't broke Wow.
It sounds to me like you don't want us to live together.
No.
No, no, I do.
I do.
It's just I mean, it's a really big step.
Is it?
We're together all the time.
Financially, it makes great sense.
Can you think of one reason why we shouldn't do this?
Well um I'm just a little thirsty.
Yeah.
I got nothing.
Great.
I'll go get my stuff.
Yeah.
Okay, all right, don't freak out.
You can make this work.
Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom?
I take a lot of medicine.
Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.
MRS.
Are you ready for dessert?
No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz.
As it is, I'm going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I'm a fireman rescuing an infant.
Oh, please.
You're a tall glass of brown water.
Have dessert.
Well, I-I really couldn't.
But, uh, I've had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you've had removed from your body over the years.
Didn't know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.
The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls.
Well, if you have to go, how about I put a little doggie bag together for you?
That would be lovely.
Thank you.
Mrs. Wolowitz, uh are you okay?
Don't mind me.
I just cry when I'm lonely and have nothing to live for.
I, uh I suppose I could stay for some dessert.
Great.
You like chocolate chip cheesecake?
Sure.
I'll make one.
One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure.
That's Leonard's.
Children's toy.
One Star Trek: The Next Generation phaser.
That's Leonard's.
Children's toy.
One Game of Thrones collector's edition Longclaw sword.
Oh Leonard and I bought that together.
That's a bit of an ethical conundrum.
Eh, I'll keep it.
So, uh, what's your plan moving forward?
Uh, suppose I'll have to find and cultivate a new roommate.
What a task that will be.
Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?
No.
Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule.
He would just go whenever the mood struck him.
Like a dog-boy.
Exactly.
What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?
That would be ideal.
If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.
Great.
Here I am!
Wait.
Here who is where?
Me.
Aren't I your perfect roommate?
Um Think about it, Sheldon.
I'm not a stranger, we're intellectually compatible, I'm willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button.
What do you think?
Um Tell me one reason why this isn't a fantastic idea.
Um See?
You can't.
I'm gonna go see if Leonard's room is big enough for my water bed.
Um Good buddy Leonard.
Good buddy Leonard.
Good buddy Leonard.
What do you want?
Hey, good buddy.
So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.
Is that so?
Yes.
All is forgiven, so come back home.
I'll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I'll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.
Cut to the chase, Sheldon.
Okay.
Amy's decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp.
That's a lot of product.
Hey.
What's going on?
Oh, get this: Suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.
Really?
Interesting.
Well, too late, pal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Penny and I are very happy living together.
Isn't that right?
It's like the happiness won't ever leave the apartment.
Leonard, please.
You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn't ready for.
Yes!
That is a real thing.
And it doesn't mean you don't care about each other; it just means things are moving at a pace you're not comfortable with, and that's fine.
Well, if he doesn't want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels.
Well, maybe he doesn't know how to say it without hurting her feelings.
Feelings?
What am I, a hippie at a love-in?
No.
The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn't refute.
That is the worst, isn't it?
Yes.
I'm sorry, Sheldon.
I can't help you.
Oh, spoiler alert: This door's about to slam in your face.
Oh, there you are.
When do I get a key to our apartment?
Um  Hello?
Hey.
How'd it go last night with my mom?
Okay, I guess.
What time did you leave?
Actually, I'm still here.
What?
You spent the night?
Yeah.
Uh after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.
You wore my pajamas?
Mm-hmm.
How do you sleep in these things?
Silk pajamas on satin sheets?
I slid out of the bed, like, three times.
MRS.
Rajesh!
You up?
You ready for breakfast?
Oh, boy.
Breakfast.
Okay, Raj, listen to me.
You need to get out of there.
But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.
If you don't leave now, she'll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.
Oh, Howard, stop.
Trust me, you're not Jewish.
That's how they get you.
You're being silly.
I can leave whenever I want.
Oh, really?
Where are your clothes and your shoes?
They're on the chair, right over Oy vey.
Hello, home wrecker.
What did I do?
You gave Leonard somewhere to go.
Thanks to you, Amy's out buying his and hers bath towels.
Like I'd ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.
Okay.
Listen, the truth is I don't want him living with me.
Great.
Kick him out.
Break his heart.
Everybody wins.
No, I don't want to break his heart.
I love him.
This is just happening too fast.
You think this is fast?
It's just a matter of time before I see Amy's leg stubble in my shower.
Yeah, and I've seen those legs.
You might want to get some Drano.
Hold on.
If you don't want to live with Leonard, why don't you just tell him?
Well, you know how he is.
He's sensitive and emotional.
That's because he drinks too much soy milk.
Well, I don't know what else we can do but tell them the truth.
I suppose there's no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.
Yeah.
And who knows how Amy will react.
Here's some more ice.
Oh, thanks.
What were we thinking?
We should have just done it the regular way.
Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.
Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?
If you could bend that far, you'd be doing us both a favor.
Hey, Raj.
What's up?
You were right!
I can't get out of here!
You're still at my mother's?
I'm trapped.
My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys.
I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks.
What do I do?
Hey, you wanted a woman in your life.
Now you got one.
Come on, Howard, help me.
MRS.
Rajesh, tatellah, I ran you a bath.
Oh, my God.
She's not gonna bathe me, is she?
Gee, I wish I could tell you no.
All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.
But, Howard Should we go back and rescue him?
It's too late.
We'll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.
Here you go.
I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.
Is it kung pao chicken?
Yes.
Brown rice, not white rice?
Yes.
Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?
Yes.
I did good, right?
: Yes.
Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?
No.
Yeah, why would you?
Oh, and, uh, check this out.
I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.
"Hello.
This is Sheldon".
"And this is Amy".
"We're not home right now".
"'Cause we out dropping science, son".
"Leave a message".
Beep.
You can't live here.
What?
Why?
Is it the message?
I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn't break in.
No.
It's not the message.
Well, what is it, then?
I did everything just the way you like it.
You did.
Then what the hell, Sheldon?
!
We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you!
I watch your dopey space movies.
I signed your ridiculous contract.
I even stopped wearing lip gloss 'cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery.
I am the best girlfriend you're ever gonna have.
You give me one good reason why I can't live here.
It's Penny's fault.
What?
She doesn't want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again.
She's the snake in our garden.
She's the reason we can't be happy.
Hey, Ames.
Yeah.
"Hey, Ames," nothing.
I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I can't 'cause you don't want to live with Leonard.
What?
Sheldon, what did you say?
I said the truth.
You don't want to live with Leonard, and you know it.
Since when don't you want to live with me?
Oh, don't get all huffy.
You're the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.
Yeah, I think we should talk about that.
And since you love the truth so much, why don't you tell Amy you don't want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?
I thought we were talking about the other thing.
You're a coward.
Well, the evidence does support that.
Come on, Amy, let's go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.
You know what would show them?
I should move in here with you.
Um  Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?
Okay.
Have you seen the one where Lori dies?
No.
Or maybe she doesn't.
Let's find out.
MRS.
Where you going?
No!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
You'll never believe what happened to me at work today.
Hmm?
This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.
You're kidding.
Did you Heimlich him?
No.
I said, "Oh, my God, I think that old guy's choking," and then one of the busboys Heimlich'ed him.
You're a hero.
Yeah, that was the point of the story.
Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?
Um, I think so.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
It's Valentine's Day.
Oh, right.
Yeah, we can do something.
You could be a little more into it.
No, I'm into it, I'm into it.
Just, there's so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.
Okay, well, this time it's going to be different.
Because I am like a romance ninja.
You don't see it coming, and then bam!
Romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!
You know, sometimes I think I've made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.
So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chilies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.
I concur, but you changed the subject.
What are we doing for Valentine's Day?
Oh, you caught that, did you?
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
: Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay!
Okay.
Everything okay?
Bernie's a little cranky since she's been working, like, 17 hours a day.
And I've got a lot on my plate, too, because I've been busting my tail playing Assassin's Creed.
Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine's Day?
Not really.
Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and white-knuckling it till morning.
What do you got going on?
Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.
There must be something we can do.
Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don't have dates?
That actually sounds kind of nice.
Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.
That's good.
Or maybe something a little less "hand in the pants".
Oh, Alex, excellent.
I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.
Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you.
I've been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.
Oh, no, no.
That's not going to happen, no.
What I need you to do is find a Valentine's gift for my girlfriend.
You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.
Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents.
Now, here is Let's see.
This is This is about $2,000.
Um, I think she likes monkeys and the color gray.
Contribute to my work.
Ah, kids say the darnedest things.
Hey, you coming to lunch?
Yeah, one second.
Come here.
I want to show you something.
What you looking at?
Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine's Day since she's been such a pain in the ass.
You can't find a card that says that?
Check it out.
I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart 1/1,000 the size of a grain of sand.
: Oh, that's cool.
A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.
From her micro-husband.
That is amazing.
How long did this take you?
Mmm, about 12 hours.
I pulled an all-nighter.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time.
What are you and Penny doing?
Oh, I'm going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.
Oh, that's not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of Want to come to dinner with us?
Yes, please.
Okay.
Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine's gift, so you're up kid.
Dazzle me.
Go.
Okay, I think I have some really great choices.
I went on Amy's Facebook page and read up on her interests.
Now, see, I never would have thought to do that.
Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you.
But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot.
Anyway, my socks are on.
Let's knock them off.
Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favorite songs.
Now, Amy already has a real harp.
And it can play any song.
What are you trying to pull here?
No, I just thought it would be Next.
Okay.
Um, I know she's a fan of The Canterbury Tales, Mmm.
so I found this cool map that illustrates the character's journey through England.
I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.
But she's got Google Maps on her phone.
I don't know how to respond to that.
Well, I hope it's with a third good option, because these first two blah.
Okay.
Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last.
Since Amy's a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells.
And I managed to find this signed print.
Wow.
Oh, this is truly remarkable.
Thank you.
I think I'll keep it for myself.
What about your girlfriend?
It's too late.
I call dibs.
This place is really beautiful.
Wah romance ninja.
Hey.
Sorry we're late.
No problem.
We just sat down.
Mmm, would you like some wine?
Yeah, fill her up.
I'll tell you when to stop.
Is everything okay?
Terrific.
Couldn't be better.
Oh, bite me.
Look, we can still have a nice night.
Just tell me where it is.
Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I'd tell you.
Uh, where what is?
She hid my Xbox like I'm a child.
Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don't give it back, I'm telling.
I've been working late every night.
All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry.
But did he do it?
No.
He just kept on playing that stupid game.
You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.
I said I'm sorry.
Sorry doesn't clean my underpants, buddy.
I told you, turn them inside out.
And I told you to bite me.
Trying to have a magical night here, guys.
Oh, son of a bitch.
What?
Nothing.
Nothing.
No, tell me.
It's just this guy I used to date.
Oh.
Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who's here with him now.
You're kidding.
And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.
I know it's not ideal, but don't let them ruin our night.
No, you're totally right.
She could be skinny 'cause she's dying.
That's the spirit.
You know what, screw them.
Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
What?
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Oh, my God, yes.
Of course I'll marry you.
Two can play this game.
Penny Get up.
All right.
It's nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine's Day can come here tonight and be together.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
In fact, there's no place I would rather be than here.
Except on a date with anybody.
Literally anybody.
You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out.
If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.
What?
Oh, yeah, think about it.
We'd hang out, we'd read comic books, we'd see movies.
It'd be like the best relationship ever.
That does sound nice.
Then I'd take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.
What?
Oh, I can't believe he's going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.
Isn't it kind of nice?
I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.
What, so I'm the wrong person?
Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.
They do look happy.
Yeah, maybe tonight.
But a year from now, he'll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox.
Well, he will.
You know what?
Why don't we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine's Day?
Yes, absolutely.
Now they're doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy.
I totally taught him that.
I thought we were letting it go.
We were; it's just it's not fair, okay?
They're bad people.
It's not supposed to end happy for them; it's supposed to end happy for me.
Um it did end happy for you.
You're here with me.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.
Oh, come on, don't make this about you.
Oh, I'm not.
It's about you.
Yeah, well, whatever, okay?
I told you, Valentine's Day sucks.
This one does, and you're the reason why.
What?
You know, compared to them, I'm feeling pretty good about us.
Me, too.
How about we blow off dessert, go home early I'll do that laundry.
Thank you.
I love you.
Love you, too.
So where'd you hide it?
Where you'd never look.
Damn it, it's in the washing machine.
Hello.
Hello.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Okay.
Shall we go to dinner?
Hang on.
As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.
Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it.
I've been working on this facial expression all day.
And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish.
So, I canceled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine's Day.
What is that?
By doing none of it-- no dinner, no romance, no gifts.
We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.
Really?
Well, that's what you'd love, isn't it?
More than anything.
Well, then that's what we're going to do.
Well I don't know what to say.
This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone's ever given me.
And that's including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.
I'm your girlfriend.
That's my job.
And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.
No.
No, after everything you didn't do for me tonight, I want you to have it.
What's this?
Read it.
"Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information"?
At the bottom.
"In case of emergency, please contact Amy Farrah Fowler".
And there's my phone number.
This is the most beautiful gift you could've ever given me.
Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?
And you picked me.
It's like you said-- you're my girlfriend.
Oh, Sheldon.
Yeah Okay.
Stop ruining Valentine's Day and order my pizza.
Night.
Yep.
You know what?
That was pretty crappy of you.
I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it's like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.
Yeah, I know.
I'm a total bitch.
I'm not saying that.
Well, I am.
Fine, you win.
You're a bitch.
Why couldn't we just have a nice time?
I don't know.
Maybe 'cause things are going so well between us lately and I've been really happy.
Okay, you're gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.
Obviously, I have some commitment issues.
Glaringly obvious.
Go on.
As long as things keep going great between us, you'll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I'm gonna end up saying yes, and then we're gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.
Okay.
I know I propose a lot.
So how about this?
I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.
What what do you mean?
Are you breaking up with me?
No.
No, no, no, no.
But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.
Really?
Yes.
It's all on you.
But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards.
I want you down on one knee, flowers.
I want to be swept off my feet.
Yeah, you got it.
And I'm cool with surprises.
But nothing on a Jumbotron.
I don't want to cry on a big screen like that.
Okay.
You know what?
This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.
You do?
Leonard Hofstadter Yes?
will you be my valentine?
Sorry.
Maybe next year.
I'm just kidding!
Romance ninja.
Let's have sex!
Wah!
Thank you, guys, for doing this.
We're glad you could make it.
Usually I spend Valentine's Day sad and alone.
This year, I'm just sad.
What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?
I know.
I hate myself most of the time, but tonight's the night I know everyone else does, too.
I think you're cool.
Great.
I got to tell you, we've got to stop beating ourselves up like this.
Excuse me, everybody.
Can I have your attention, please?
We're all here tonight because we have no one to be with.
But that doesn't make us mutants.
The only mutants here are in these comic books.
We've got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we're in a relationship.
You know what I see when I look around?
I see a room full of great people.
So let's give ourselves a break.
We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we're never truly alone.
That was cool.
What you said.
You really think so?
Yeah, I do.
Thank you.
Uh Would you like to, uh get a cup a cup of coffee or?
Okay.
Later, losers!
Hello?
Another medical emergency?
What's wrong with him now?
I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider.
How exactly does a bump feel Asian?
Just put him on the phone.
Sheldon, I am not driving over there again.
Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumor that turned out to be an ice cream headache.
Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact.
Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumor.
I'm on my way.
Brain tumor would explain a lot.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Previously on The Big Bang Theory Can I have your attention, please?
We're all here tonight because we have no one to be with.
We've got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we're in a relationship.
We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we're never truly alone.

Thank you.
Uh would you like to, uh get a cup a cup of coffee?
Okay.
Later, losers!
So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it's a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts.
That's where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I'm an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game.
And rhyming is also my game.
So, uh, two games.
Uh, anyway, that-that's enough about me.
I want to hear everything about you.
I have to go to the bathroom.
I go to the bathroom, too.
Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit.
Oh, I've had it checked out, it's nothing.
Hmm!
This is going great!
Mmm can I have a refill on my chai tea?
Yes I have a good feeling about this.
I should have bought condoms.

Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags.
My apologies that this episode is coming late.
I did shoot one last week, in honor of Black History Month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered "wildly racist".
My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by The Man.
Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado; it's also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbor, and flag virgin-- yeah, not a real virgin.
She's had coitus many times.
Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast.
Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles.
Penny.
Hello.
So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags.
Yeah, I can't tell you how many times I've been at a party where everyone's talking about flags and I just couldn't join in.
Yeah.
Well, you came to the right place.
Uh, I'm sorry, can we just pause for a minute?
What's wrong?
I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation.
It's something we work on in my acting class.
Interesting.
A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic.
Perhaps that isn't the compliment it sounds like.
Yeah, let's try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit.
You know, when you're all hunched like that, you're shutting the audience out, but when you're relaxed and open, you're inviting them in.
Right.
And which one do I want?
Let's try open.
If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it's to go where the wind takes you.
As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole.
And action.
So, Penny what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?
Um, well, I'm from Nebraska.
So what can you tell me about the state flag?
Gosh, Penny what'd you have for breakfast?
A big glass of good question juice?
The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue.
Spread your legs; invite them in.
I'm telling you, something's wrong.
I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.
Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?
Don't look under that rock.
Raj, you okay?
You in there?
Go away!
Come on, buddy, open up.
We're worried about you.
Oh, just because I stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened?
Maybe something good happened.
Did something good happen?
Of course not!
Nothing good ever happens!
Whoa.
What?
Nope, just-just whoa.
It smells pretty ripe in here.
You kind feel it in your eyes.
Raj, what's going on?
I was humiliated by yet another woman.
You didn't kill her and chop her up-- that's not what we're smelling, right?
No.
I took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me.
Oh, you poor baby.
I went and looked.
It was a high and tiny window.
She must have been very motivated.
I'm sorry.
That's awful, but come on.
you got to shake it off.
Yeah, you can't stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.
Why not?
With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want.
Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.
Lobsters overnight?
Oh, you're kidding.
Let me see.
Well, I'll be.
Look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.
The surf and turf sounds good.
See if they corn on the cob.
Guys!
We're trying to get him out of here, not you in.
You're wasting your time.
Just please, leave me alone.
Now what?
I don't know.
We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it.
We're all thinking it.
I just had the decency to wait for him to leave.
Hello, Sheldon.
Hello.
How's the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?
Fine.
Just hold on.
Mommy's on the phone!
Sorry.
We've cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense.
Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms.
Those guys were mellow.
Good news.
Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online.
Oh, that's right.
How'd it go with Penny?
Much better than I expected.
She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language.
Watch.
Welcome to my world.
Not welcome to my world.
Welcome.
Not welcome.
Subtle, but powerful.
I know.
I'm still learning to control it.
Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?
Why would I do that?
Because she's your friend, and she did a nice job.
I'm sure she'd like to hear it.
All right.
I didn't mean now.
Hello?
Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette.
Well, I'd like a normal boyfriend.
Deal with it.
Oh, hi.
What's up?
Um You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?
No.
I didn't start yet; it's fine.
Okay.
So, what do you need?
Well, I was thinking about you helping me out last night Penny.
And I just wanted to tell you Penny.
that the answer to the question, "Who did a great job"?
is you.
Penny.
Really?
Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.
Aw, sweetie, you just made my day.
Okay.
Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night.
I could put you and Amy on the guest list.
Oh, that sounds terrible.
Why would I want to do that?
That's right.
They're no good without the lighter.
Well, so much for your advice on complimenting Penny.
Why?
What happened?
She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play.
Don't worry.
Luckily, I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river.
Sheldon, that's very rude.
She helped you with your show.
The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play.
Oh, so many crazy rules.
That better be Tootsie Rolls you're throwing at me!
Penny.
Penny.
Penny.
Oh yeah, much better.
What?
Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, I'm obligated to do something nice for you.
So yes, I'll go to your dopey play.
Hey, I don't want you to go anymore.
Why not?
You should go 'cause you want to go, not because you have to.
Oh, Dear Lord, more rules?
Where does it stop?
Can I want to go because I have to want to go?
Okay.
Do whatever you want.
Yeah, but now, wait.
Do whatever I want or whatever I have to want?
Oh, for God's sake, just come to the play.
All right.
I don't want to, but at least that makes sense.
You know, I haven't seen Raj in several days.
Is he no longer a part of our social group?
And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement?
Perhaps, this time, we go Latin.
He's just decided he's never leaving his apartment again.
Oh, brilliant.
I've been itching to pull that trigger.
He's upset because he can't get anywhere with women.
Would it help if I gave him some pointers?
I'm just funnin' ya.
Hi.
I don't know if you remember me, but I was here the other night at your party.
Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.
Uh, yeah.
You're the one?
Okay, let me tell you something.
That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend.
Okay?
He was devastated.
Sorry.
Can you just give him this?
Okay.
But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man.
If you go running out on him again, you're only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.
Come on, she came back.
This is good news.
You should celebrate.
I don't want to celebrate.
Not even a little?
I mean we could have a pants party.
Go put some on.
Why would I want her number?
I don't want anything to do with this woman.
Oh, come on, Raj No, you don't get it.
I want nothing to do with any woman.
My heart is stone.
From now on, I'm a monk.
I renounce all worldly pleasures.
Except for lobster.
And garlic butter.
Boy, I want to tell you it's her loss, but you are not making it easy.
You're-you're a good friend for trying to help, but I've made my choice.
All right.
Well, I'll see you around.
See you.
Oh, wait-- take her number.
I don't want the temptation.
Okay.
I must be strong so I don't stray from my true purpose: the study of the universe.
All right.
Thanks for ruining lobster for me.
Wait!
Give me the number!
Give me the number!
Give me the number!
So, Amy, what's going on with your addiction study?
Sadly, I'm no longer associated with that project.
Why?
What happened?
Typical bureaucratic nonsense.
You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own feces back at them and suddenly you're "unprofessional".
I'm sorry that I asked.
All right, let's get this stupid play over with.
Uh, hang on.
Empty your pockets.
Why?
You know why.
The Nintendo DS.
And the PSP.
Now the Gameboy.
Aw, for Pete's sake.
Can we go now?
Well, is that all of it?
Just set it down.
Just so you know, this is not a stupid play.
A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.
It's about streetcars?
Oh, great.
I won't need this.
Just a sec.
Oh, who says "just a sec"?
I hate myself!
Hello.
Hi.
Uh, would you like to come in?
Oh, no, I can't stay.
Oh.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry for running out of the coffee shop.
That wasn't cool.
So, uh Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Wait.
Can you at least tell me what went wrong?
It's okay.
I can take anything.
Unless it's something I did, or said, or am.
'Cause those are, like, my buttons.
No, it's not any of that.
It's just I kind of have a hard time around people I don't know.
Really?
Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?
I've been trying to force myself into situations that I'm not comfortable with.
I saw the flyer in the store window, and I made myself go in.
I don't even like comic books.
Yeah, me neither.
Then what were you doing there?
I lied.
I love them.
I only said that so you'd go out with me.
Oh, you don't want to do that.
I'm kind of broken.
That's great.
I'm broken, too.
Oh, no, you're not.
Oh, I totally am.
If it wasn't for this beer, I couldn't even talk to you right now.
I'm a wreck.
There are many things seriously wrong with me.
And not quirks, either.
Like diagnosable psychological problems.
Maybe brain damage.
Well, how do I know you're not just saying that?
Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you'll see.
Okay.
Text me.
Bye.
You won't regret it.
I'm the most pathetic guy you've ever met.
And that, boys and girls is how it's done.
You love her very much, don't you?
Yes.
I think you have a great capacity for devotion.
You'll be lonely when she passes on, won't you?
I understand what that is.
To be lonely?
: She's pretty good, huh?
She is.
But when do they get to the part about streetcars?
when I was a very young girl.
When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery love.
All at once, and much, much too completely.
It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow.
That's how it struck the world for me.
But I was unlucky.
Deluded.
She's remarkable.
She really is.
Our Penny's a star.
and softness and tenderness which How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can't remember "no tomato" on my hamburger?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Look, I know you guys don't want to do this, but we have no choice.
So, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with.
I got "whine".
I got the "b word".
Yeah, well, it's in our contract to serve on a university committee.
And frankly, this is one I believe in.
Okay, here we go.
Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.
Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn't have spent so much of my 20s in the shower.
If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.
Helping women?
Yeah, helping anyone.
People should take care of themselves.
Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?
I'm not saying people can't use tools.
Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.
You don't think it's worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.
I think that's incredibly sexist of you.
I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.
You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?
Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.
Howard's disturbing recollections aside, I don't appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.
Yes, I know, you're too smart for this.
Exactly.
It's like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.
Got it.
All right, I'm thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names.
Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.
I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials, so as not to be pre-judged.
Harry Potter's J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek's D.C. Fontana.
Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons.
All right, I think we've really helped women today.
Let's fire up the old Xbox.
Guys, please don't make this a school project where I'm the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.
No, we're not.
This time you're the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.
So, you think I'm one of the smarter kids?
No, you're a tool I was using to make my point.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
Guys, our topic is "Encouraging Women in Science".
Can you at least play a less sexist game How is it sexist?
My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.
Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30.
And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.
Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner-- I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.
Sheldon, you're always saying how much smarter you are than me.
Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.
All your ideas address the issue at a university level.
By then it's too late.
You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
That's actually good.
Why didn't I think of that?
Some people are otters, some people are rocks.
I wonder if there's a way we could give the idea a trial run.
Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students.
That's great-- try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.
Oh, hold on.
While I'm comfortable speaking about science, I'm not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren.
Better Google it.
What exactly are you looking up?
"How do I get No!
No!
Thanks again for letting me crash "girls' night".
Are you kidding?
You brought fancy wine and made fondue.
I've slept with guys for less.
It's a joke.
Based on real events.
Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little.
I'm supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.
Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady in the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment.
Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks picnic near a lunatic asylum a wine tasting on Skid Row.
Eh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues.
Maybe we could start with something simpler.
Why don't you take her to Disneyland?
You go on Space Mountain, you're in the dark, she's holding onto you.
Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on.
It's a joke.
Based on real events.
Mm, Disneyland?
I don't know.
With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India.
I haven't been to Disneyland since I was a kid.
We should definitely go one weekend.
Weekends are too crowded.
So, blow off work, go on a weekday.
Hooky?
I've never played hooky in my life.
My mom said that's how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.
It's more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.
Joke?
I can laugh about it now.
So, what do you say?
This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?
I'm in.
Me, too.
Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?
Oh, yeah, right.
Wait, what was your problem again?
I am a man who can't talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can't be around other people.
Yeah, that's a toughie.
Let's think.
Hmm.
We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?
It's nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.
Well, they're actually pretty excited.
I'm their most famous alum.
If you don't count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.
This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.
Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd.
And now you're also an astronaut.
So many memories.
I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on?
Oh, look, here's my old locker.
I have a masters in engineering and I still can't figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there.
Hey.
What?
Nothing.
Smart.
We don't want any problems.
I can't believe I ditched work for Disneyland.
What did you tell your boss?
Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages.
At 7:00 last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood.
At 9:30, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird.
At 11:30, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose.
At 12:45, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I'm going to Disneyland.
Penny, what did you say?
I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said "bye".
So, what are we gonna do first?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover.
Ooh, that sounds like fun.
You're kidding, right?
We're not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?
Come on, do it with us.
All right, whatever.
How does it work?
Okay, so, you pick your princess-- Sleeping Beauty, Snow White Cinderella-- they give you hair, makeup, the works.
Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.
Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.
Yeah.
We can't all be Cinderella.
Then how do we decide?
Well, it's simple.
This was my idea.
I'm driving.
I'm Cinderella.
You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now.
Excuse me, I'm meeting a girl here.
It's kind of our first date.
In a library?
She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea.
People say I'm a little awkward, too.
May I join you?
No, you can't join us.
Just go-go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.
You can do better.
Oh, we're eating here?
We're having a texting date?
I love that.
As you're reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent.
Okay, who's ready for some science?
Me, too.
Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be.
How cool, you ask?
Well, how about negative 273 degrees, 'cause that's the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value.
Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it?
What?
All right!
So now let's bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Hello, female children.
Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist.
Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie.
Codiscoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science until her hair fell out; her vomit and stool became filled with blood and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery.
With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can't happen to any of you.
Are we done?
Can we go?
The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too.
I mean, look at me.
I went to this very school.
Those desks you're sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them.
Did you go to the moon?
No, but I did go to the International Space Station.
Did you fly the rocket?
No, but I was in the rocket.
I didn't actually So you just flew around?
That's kind of like my uncle.
He's a flight attendant.
No I'm an American hero.
Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?
Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh?
Thank you, astronaut Howard.
Um, I am what's called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers.
Yes?
How did you decide to become a scientist?
Uh, excellent question.
Um, I suppose I've always been into science, you know My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction.
Eh, pushed might be a better way to describe it.
To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star.
Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police.
Yeah, no, sure, you laugh.
Just like my mother did.
After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided.
She said my dreams were misguided.
That's just a little freestyle.
My dad's a gynecologist in India, so if you're over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he's "at your cervix".
That's terrible.
Your dad should be sent to the pun-itentiary.
That's a fitting pun-ishment.
I still don't know what you do for a living.
Web design.
Anything I might have seen?
I don't know.
You ever look at porn Web sites?
No, never.
What is porn?
Sorry.
Autocorrect.
That was supposed to say "prom Web sites".
Ooh, fun.
I love prom.
The romance, the gowns, it's like a fairy tale come to life.
Sorry.
Autocorrect.
That was supposed to say, "I like sports".
I never wanted to play the cello.
How do you meet girls playing the cello?
"Hey, you want to come over to my house "and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee"?
Quick, pull the fire alarm.
Let's get out of here.
Uh, hello again.
Um, yeah, I don't know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it's clear you young women here, today, have been.
While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now.
Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?
We're here.
Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.
It's our pleasure.
I'm Dr. Fowler, and I'm a neuroscientist.
And I'm Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I'm a microbiologist.
The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds.
That's true.
Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.
Unless you want to be Cinderella.
Come at me.
See what happens.
This was really fun.
My battery's dying, so I'm just gonna talk.
Thanks for today.
I've been trying to do more things that scare me, and coming here was definitely one of them.
But it was also really nice.
So thanks, and, um, I'm gonna go.
Maybe I could do one more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good-bye?
You know, if that's okay.
Okay.
Panic attack!
Maybe next time.
I'm counting that as foreplay.
Bernie, I'm home.
You have fun today?
Yes, and I have a surprise for you.
Please be Cinderella.
Please be Cinderella.
Well, hello, Prince Charming.
Milady.
Hey, how was your what?
I can explain.
I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got What are you doing?
Disneyland.
Go on, I'm listening.
Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up.
Heard you the first time.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
What you doing?
You said clean up.
I'm cleaning up.
You can't just throw everything in the closet.
Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can't do both; this isn't sex.
What if someone looks in there?
They're just coming over for dinner.
No one's gonna look in the closet.
Well, you don't know that.
What if someone's looking for the bathroom and they open that door?
Could work out.
For all we know, there's a toilet in there somewhere.
Fine.
But after tonight, we need to get a handle on this mess.
You know what we should do?
We should show the closet to Sheldon.
Why?
Are you kidding?
He's like a savant at organizing.
Everything in his apartment has a label on it.
Including his label maker, which has a label that says "Label Maker".
And if you look really close at that label maker label, you'll see a label that says "Label".
He's our guest; we can't just ask him to straighten our closet.
No, we wouldn't ask him.
We'd just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.
Hey, guys, come on in.
Hi.
Hi.
Ooh, it smells good.
Thanks.
And, Sheldon, I know tonight's the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
No, you really shouldn't have.
I brought my own.
You stopped and got him takeout?
I had no choice.
He kept kicking the back of my seat.
Sheldon, I've been cooking all day.
Well now don't you feel silly.
Show him the closet.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
These spring rolls are amazing.
Good job, Bernadette.
That's the takeout that Sheldon brought.
Oh, well, I'm sure they wouldn't have tasted nearly as good if I hadn't tried your food first.
Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by color?
Color's fine.
Wrong, they'll be arranged seasonally.
Sheldon, aren't you gonna spend a little time with Amy?
Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it.
The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.
Yeah, and some thanks I got.
The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.
His quirks just make you love him more.
Someone please agree with me.
Sheldon, come on.
It's getting late.
Time to go.
Oh, five more minutes.
That's what you said five minutes ago.
Amy and Penny are already in the car.
Let's move it.
How come I never get to do anything I want to do?
You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.
Please, Leonard!
He said it's okay!
Sheldon, it's-- Wait, I can go home without you?
Bye!
Howard, I have a few questions.
I found three bowling pins.
Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?
Juggle.
You health nuts kill me.
Oh, my God, it's beautiful!
Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.
Uh, just a couple more items.
Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box.
Now, based on the content, it could either be filed Whoa, you opened this?
Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia.
Now, as I was saying, based on the content I couldn't be less interested.
Now, come on, I'll take you home.
Howard, don't you want to know what's in the letter?
If I wanted to know, I would've opened it years ago.
The closet looks great.
Let's get out of here.
Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?
Do whatever you want.
Thanks.
Oh.
Great party.
You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, "Oh, I sat in gum".
What is your point?
Well, it's just kind of weird how grown up he is now.
Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.
Really?
You couldn't just say that?
You had to tell the scrotum story?
Trying to paint a picture.
Yeah, it was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too.
Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.
Sure.
Just, when you say "dressed up," you mean nice clothes, right?
Not, like, capes and tights and crap?
Yeah.
Although No!
Howie, you okay?
Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.
Told you you shouldn't have espresso after dinner.
I know the little cups make you feel big, but it's not worth it.
It's this stupid letter.
Did you read it?
No.
You must be curious.
Of course I'm curious.
I haven't seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid.
And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday?
What's that about?
Why don't you read it?
Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.
He abandoned me and my mother.
Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?
I get that.
So, what do you want to do with it?
Something I should've done a long time ago.
Really?
Are you sure?
Yep.
Feel better?
I do.
Great.
Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
I can't believe he set it on fire.
Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out.
And he was already having a tough day 'cause he accidentally wore my pants to work.
I don't know why he was upset.
They were bigger on him than me.
Boy, I'm really curious what's in that letter.
Me, too, but I guess now we'll never know.
Well, you said Sheldon read it.
Why not ask him?
I can't do that.
What kind of wife would I be if I didn't respect my husband's privacy?
What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?
That works.
Okay.
Blech.
Like cleaning out the entire building's belly button.
Hey, Sheldon.
Oh, hello.
What can I do for you ladies?
You have something we want.
Oh, dear.
My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.
No, we just want information.
Oh.
Oh, I've got that in spades.
Ravage me.
We heard you read the letter from Howard's father.
I did.
What did it say?
Yeah I can't tell you that.
I'm bound by closet organizer/ organizee confidentiality.
Sheldon, that's not a real thing.
Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend's hand at the movies.
You know.
That doesn't stop you from pawing at me like you're a bear and I'm a trash can full of sweets.
Why do you even care?
Just tell us what it says.
Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard.
By happenstance, I came to know it.
That doesn't give me the right to disseminate it freely.
Come on.
Look, the letter was found in Bernadette's closet.
Doesn't that count for something?
Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?
Yeah, obviously.
Well played.
Sometimes I don't give you enough credit, Penny.
Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.
Actually, all I did was invite you.
Well, put your mind at ease.
I'm here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard's dinner party's ass.
Now, the first thing we need is a theme.
I'm thinking ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.
I'm thinking you need a testosterone patch.
Penny and I just want to do something low-key.
You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d'oeuvres.
So your theme is "I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe's"?
Hate to miss that.
Hey, where have you been?
Oh, Leonard.
If I was prone to sarcasm, I'd say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
I meant, "Golly, Sheldon, you've been gone a long time".
Oh.
Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy.
They made me reveal confidential information about Howard's father.
What information?
I can't tell you that.
I am bound by closet organizer/ organizee confidentiality.
Well, come on, we won't tell anyone.
Sorry, badgering me won't work.
What you should have said is, "It's pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us".
Fine, then that.
All right, I'll tell you.
My goodness, everyone's on their game today.
This is really fun.
Yeah, it's nice to get dressed up once in a while.
Yeah, and hors d'oeuvres are delightful.
As is the company.
Aw.
My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.
Hey, uh, listen, everybody.
Before Howard gets here, let's all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.
Of course.
Sure.
Absolutely.
If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?
Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.
Yeah, try doing it in heels.
I am.
Wait.
There's something I have to tell you.
What?
I know what was in your dad's letter.
Sheldon, I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you!
Hey!
I made him tell us.
What?
"Us"?
Who else knows?
I know.
Me, too.
Same here.
Shame on all of you.
You know, too.
Couldn't leave him with one friend, could you?
So everybody knows what's in that letter except for me?
Yes, it's six against one.
Stand down, sir.
How could you do this?
I'm sorry.
If you want, we could tell you.
No, I don't want to know!
I mean, I do, but I got to go.
Used me as a human shield?
I panicked.
He looked taller than usual.
Howard?
In here.
I'm sorry.
I should have left it alone.
It's okay.
Sorry I ran off like that.
What are you looking at?
Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.
That's nice.
I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet.
Look at this.
"Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever".
Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows.
Neither race was happy to see me with those.
Think you could take a break?
Why?
Got a little surprise for you.
Come on.
Oh, honey I am in no mood to have sex tonight.
I'll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but Oh.
What are you guys doing here?
When you left, you weren't sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad's letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.
Oh, yeah, what's that?
It's simple, really.
It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition.
The-the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.
We were all thinking it, really.
It was kind of the elephant in the room, so Anyway, um, I realize if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don't tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.
Yeah.
And I said if it wasn't epistemic, we might as well not do it.
Sit down, honey.
Raj, you're up.
Okay, um It was a card for your 18th birthday.
Inside it said, "Happy birthday, Howard.
I love you.
Dad".
Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane.
Thinks it's a fly.
Silly frog.
So funny.
Sheldon.
It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.
Nice try.
That's the plot for Goonies.
Told you.
Don't.
Amy.
You didn't know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation.
And he cried because he was so proud of you.
Really?
Or that's complete poppycock which Amy made up.
It still could be the map.
Penny.
It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn't who he said he was.
Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.
I would like to change mine.
The pirate's name was Peg-Leg Antoine.
Now it's completely different from Goonies.
No, it's not.
Don't.
Okay, my turn.
Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.
Hmm.
Bernadette.
Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born.
On the back he wrote, "Howard, my son, my greatest gift".
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm terrific.
So?
Which one do you think it is matey?
Actually, I don't want to know.
I want all of them to be true.
Well, one of them is.
That's pretty cool.
Thank you, guys.
Hey, it's still early.
Why don't we go back and have that party?
Yeah, cool.
Okay?
Good.
You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn't the most interesting thing I read in the closet.
Bernadette's diary has some saucy passages.
Sheldon, don't you dare!
Th-There's nothing to worry about.
Your secret's safe with me.
That's more like it.
Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
Glad you're feeling better.
Me, too.
If I'd known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.
This turned out pretty well, huh?
Yeah, I think so.
I agree.
That is, if you've never been to or heard of a party before.
If you'd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you'd be happy all the time.
Uh, Penny, I-I have a couple of questions about your closet.
Is there any reason you're keeping this dead goldfish?
Damn, I forgot to feed him.
And that I had him.
Well, now, did you also have a dog?
Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.
Party's over!
Party's over!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies.
Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.
We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong.
My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.
Only if you're this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.
If I could keep my Gmail account, I'd be okay with that.
Hello, fellas.
Hey.
Remember when we were trying to figure out what that smell coming from Professor Tupperman's office was?
Yeah?
Turns out it was Tupperman.
Dead at his desk for two weeks.
Oh, my God.
That's terrible.
In lieu of flowers, the department chair is asking that everyone donate a bottle of Febreze.
If we're going to change the topic from jellyfish, I'd be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.
Show a little compassion-- a man died.
And turned into a puddle of goo.
Now, we can either sit around and cry over spilt professor, or we can rejoice in the knowledge that a tenured position has just opened up.
I choose to do the latter.
Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous.
A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent.
If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.
Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.
If you need my nose, you'll find it firmly lodged up the rectum of the tenure committee.
You Ph.
D's gonna go suck up like Kripke?
No.
I mean, I'll apply, but I'm not gonna stoop to playing politics.
Yeah, me neither.
It should be about the work.
And if I can't get tenure, I'd like to see you or Sheldon get it.
Raj, don't dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.
Excuse me, but I think I'm just as qualified as you are.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
So "tenured" means a job for life?
Yup.
And you can't get fired even if you're bad at it?
Mm, not really.
Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn't diminish my output.
You know, I'm like the sun.
Can't turn this off.
Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?
Mm-hmm.
Do they know they don't stand a chance 'cause you're so great?
Well put.
You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.
It would be nice to have the increased income.
Stop taking money from my parents.
Money from family does come with strings attached.
You have no idea.
They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers?
No.
"Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you're gonna have to pay for it yourself".
Well, maybe I will, old man!
I think that's enough wine for now.
I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.
She'd be proud, huh?
Oh, very.
Assuming she takes my call.
My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact.
I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow.
Or a chainsaw.
Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out buy a house get married start a family.
Yeah, or the chainsaw.
And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant!
And you know what will be on that elephant's back?
A seat warmer.
"No, Father, you may not have a ride"!
I'm gonna make some coffee.
So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?
I'm not gonna schmooze anybody.
I'm gonna let my work speak for itself.
That's great.
That shows a lot of integrity.
Thank you.
I'm a naive idiot, right?
Oh, good, you heard me.
You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.
Sheldon Cooper does not do "cozy".
You don't say.
But I suppose it wouldn't hurt to know who's on the committee.
Let's see Oh, Janine Davis.
Oh, dear.
Is that a problem?
Well Yeah, even you.
You're a slave.
I'm a what?
I'm not sure; it could go either way.
: Hey.
Mrs. Davis.
Hey.
Hey.
Dr. Hofstadter.
Yeah.
Just thought I'd come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.
Good for you.
Eh.
Not that you need it.
I bet you look great in a swimsuit.
Thank you.
I've got what my father used to call "furniture disease".
My chest is falling into my drawers.
I'm not, uh, familiar with this model.
How do I make it start?
You push start.
Right.
This one might be broken.
You have to move.
Got it.
Oh.
There.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah, now I'm feeling it.
Oh, this is great.
I could do this for the rest of my life.
Hey, speaking speaking of things you do for the rest of your life uh, did I read that you're on that-that tenure committee?
Yep.
I got to get a home gym.
Well, I'm sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and  let you know that I'll be throwing my hat in the  ring.
All right, I'll keep an eye out for that.
Yeah.
Hey, Hofstadter.
Funny seeing you here for the first time in ever.
: Go away.
Janine the Machine, let's do this!
Hey, Barry.
Well, look at that.
Burned a whole calorie.
I guess you got here early to burn off that banana bread I baked you.
Yeah, it was delicious.
Thank you.
No, my pleasure.
Oh, if you if you like banana bread I've got a-a great recipe.
: The trick is in in fresh ground I'll e-mail it to you.
All right, I'm warm.
Ready to kick it up a notch?
Let's go.
That's enough cardio for me.
I'm just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.
You okay?
Call someone!
Good day, Mrs. Davis.
This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department.
Don't be alarmed, I'm not really in space.
Anyhoo I'd like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.
Oh, come on.
Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius.
At the age of five, I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.
Mrs. Davis?
Mrs. Davis?
Mrs. Davis?
Mrs. Davis?
God, they're everywhere.
Come in.
Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?
Yes, hello.
I'm fine.
Um I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.
Uh, Dr. Cooper, that's not necessary.
It's too late.
Get ready to like me.
Roots?
The tragic history of slavery in America.
Fun for the whole family.
Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?
Um Well You are black, right?
This meeting has come to an end.
Because you want to start watching it right now.
Copy that.
Let's see.
Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu.
Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.
Gentlemen.
Where have you been?
Nurse's office.
Asthma attack?
Asthma, heart-- some kind of attack.
I'm fine, though.
You guys going to Professor Tupperman's memorial?
I don't know.
Probably not.
Barely knew him.
Yeah, you wouldn't want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there.
Oh, yeah, that's what I was hoping for-- meerkats.
I won't be able to make our date night this Thursday, so bad news for you.
You better have a good excuse this time, because "trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right" is obvious nonsense.
First of all, when you say things like that, people think you're crazy.
Second, the reason I'm cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.
It sounds like a long and tedious evening.
Eh, it will be.
Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I'd rather it be with you on date night.
But I have no choice.
The tenure committee's going to be there.
Oh!
Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.
Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.
Of course it would.
I'm well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate.
Actually, I meant you could drive me.
But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.
Do anything interesting today?
Oh, not really.
I was out shopping with Amy.
She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.
Wait-- Sheldon's going to be there?
We all promised we weren't going to go.
Oh, what a jerk.
I know.
I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.
Well, since Amy's going, do you want me there?
You know, to support you?
Oh that's nice, but it-it's just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I'm not sure how much help you'd be.
Okay.
I'm just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.
Oh, yeah.
No.
Thanks, that would be great help.
You realize you might kill some of them.
Oh, then you all can get tenure.
Come on, Daddy.
All the other scientists have seat warmers.
This is so humiliating.
I've got to get tenure.
Okay, l-let's meet halfway.
How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week?
Looks like we're both going to be living like animals.
Let's go over our emotional responses one last time.
Okay.
Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?
Sad.
The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn't make us cranky and claustrophobic.
It makes us?
Glad.
Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?
Bad.
However No.
Fine.
Bad.
Unbelievable.
You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
You're here.
Excuse me.
I'm here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.
So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.
Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here.
I guess the train store in Glendale wasn't having a cotillion after all.
And you-- you said you weren't coming here, either.
I have a thick accent.
You don't know what I said.
I'd like to know why Penny's here.
I'm here to support my man, just like you.
What are you going to do?
Take people's drink orders and get them wrong?
Do it.
What?
Did she do it yet?
She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard's cause.
Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do.
Don't just stand there.
Take your breasts out.
Ooh, meerkat fight!
You're all wasting your time.
Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom's going to change that.
Seriously, is that tape?
Like, how are they staying up like that?
Way to hit 'em with both barrels.
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.
Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?
Yes!
Okay, because that was not clear.
Sheldon!
What?
That was ambiguous.
Well, now it's biguous.
What are you gonna do about it?
Um You could talk some smack about his mother.
Well, yes, of course, he wouldn't like that at all.
Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.
Okay, okay.
Guys, what are we doing here?
I don't know what you're doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj's mother for a dollar.
Oh, you do what you want, but I don't want to lose my friends over tenure.
Friends are forever.
: So is tenure.
Walk!
I'm just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.
You're right.
This is beneath me.
Like your mother was last night.
How about it, Sheldon?
What do you think I should do?
Well, you'll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you'll make any more friends.
I don't want any more, but let's go.
Are you kidding?
I would "wove" to baby-sit for you.
I could not ask you to do that.
Nonsense.
Children "wove" me.
Something about me just makes them "waugh" and "waugh".
No.
We cannot lose to that jerk.
Yeah, screw it.
I'm going in.
You Wait.
Hold on.
I believe "Screw it, I'm going in" is what I said to your mother last night.
Don't worry, I didn't really say that.
I-I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.
Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.
Mrs. Davis?
Mrs. Davis?
Mrs. Davis?
I know you're in there.
I saw your car in the parking lot.
What?
I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure.
Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields.
I don't know what you mean by "quirks," but, um I do want to express my gratitude.
You didn't bring another gift, did you?
No, no.
No, I learned my lesson.
I understand that was inappropriate.
Good.
Anyway, thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen.
Yeah, right on, sister.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Oh, dear.
Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?
No.
Answer honestly.
This is not a trial.
That'll come later.
Absolutely not.
Help me out here.
I can't afford another demerit.
Yeah.
Uh maybe we were hacked.
You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.
Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?
I don't know.
It's a fat guy on a Segway.
That's funny everywhere.
I'm deleting it.
Well, hang on.
Maybe the Chinese haven't finished watching it yet.
You know, if you're trying to make space on the DVR, why don't you just get rid of some of the stuff you've already watched?
Like, um Alphas.
No, that's the season two finale.
That was quite the cliffhanger.
I'm going to re-watch it before season three starts.
There is no season three.
They canceled that show.
Well, they can't cancel it.
It ended on a cliffhanger.
- They did.
- Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left.
Do you want them?
Dumplings?
Don't you understand what's going on here?
As a rule, no.
That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious.
Now I'll never know what happened.
Well, why don't you make up your own ending?
Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea.
And after that, I'll make up my own rules of oral hygiene.
You know, instead of flossing, I'll rub pudding on my gums.
I'm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.
Oh, please, don't do that.
No.
They can't just cancel a show like Alphas.
You know?
They have to help the viewers let go.
Firefly did a movie to wrap things up.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book.
Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.
I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.
Ah, don't.
If they didn't want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn't have started a sci-fi channel.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
I think you're gonna be really happy with this security camera.
The optics are great, it's got infrared technology, and there's even a backup battery when the power goes out.
Whatever.
I can see my little princess while I'm at work, right?
Why can't you just watch porn like a regular guy?
I need your laptop so I can configure the software.
Wait, hold on.
This is weird.
What?
I was Googling that girl I've been dating, and I found her blog.
Cool.
Anything juicy?
She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger?
And he's Indian?
And he's an astrophysicist, too?
You know what's going on, don't you?
Yes.
Mummy was right.
American girls are sexually voracious devils.
I can't believe I have to explain this.
People change names on blogs to protect their privacy.
Roger is Raj.
Oh.
I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin.
Keep reading.
What does it say?
No, no, I don't know if I should.
If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would've told me.
It's almost like I'm reading her diary.
That's exactly what it's like.
Keep reading.
No, this is creepy.
Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.
It's not creepy.
Don't listen to him.
Oh, look who's got the sweetest kisses.
Should I go?
With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever.
It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called "Brewbacca's".
You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
It is the perfect show for the two of us.
It's got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance.
I cannot oversell this!
What do you say?
It's 6:30 in the morning.
I thought you grew up on a farm.
Hello, SyFy Network?
Yeah, this is your vice president of programming.
Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas.
Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately.
Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it's me, and I don't want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know?
I just I want this done.
No, I am not the person who just called.
That man was clearly a cowboy.
Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y'all canceling his favorite show.
Why do they keep hanging up on me?
I'm sorry you're upset.
You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.
I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.
Okay.
Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.
Oh, that's nonsense.
I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time.
I don't care how they end.
You know, I might be able to help you with this.
There's a whole field of behavioral neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.
Yeah, but I just told you, I don't have a problem with closure.
You sure about that?
Oh, quite sure.
That proves nothing.
Ready to go to lunch?
Do you think I'm feminine?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Thanks a lot.
What's going on?
I broke down, and I read Lucy's blog.
And in one of the entries, she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine.
Just a little?
That's great.
I have to talk to her about this.
Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things?
Listen to me, if she's writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage.
Rig the game.
Well, that doesn't seem fair.
Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?
No, it's not.
I've always thought that was unfair.
So take what's in that blog and use it to get her pants off.
Why do you have to make everything so filthy?
Why couldn't you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?
"The key to her heart".
That's nice.
Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?
I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women: Sir Elton John.
So, did you love it?
Of course you loved it.
How could you not love it?
Tell me how much you loved it.
It was cute.
Oh, don't say cute.
That's the worst.
W's wrong with cute?
It just makes things seem small.
It diminishes them.
So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?
You can try, but nobody's gonna believe you.
I just I don't understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.
I liked it.
I'm excited.
Well, then, tell your face.
What do you want from me?
You know what?
Never mind.
We gave it a shot.
Let's just see what else is on.
Oh, come on, don't be like that.
Well I'm sorry I called it cute.
Let's watch another one.
Really?
Yeah, it was fun.
Kind of reminded me of my high school.
But instead of vampires, we had meth heads.
But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.
All right, cool.
I-I think you'll like the next one better.
All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.
Oh.
Well, that's like my high school, too.
But instead of a curse, it was crabs.
I've come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.
I take issue with the word "compulsive".
All I'm saying is, we live in a world where closure isn't always an op tion.
Okay.
For the sake of argument, let's say I have a problem.
What would be your plan for addressing it?
I'm going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn't so overwhelming.
By playing tic-tac-toe?
Yep.
Your turn.
Oh, Amy.
And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies.
Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw none of which will deny me closure.
Especially since I'm about to win.
B-But we didn't finish.
Exactly.
How does that make you feel?
The same way any normal person would.
Feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.
And that's exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.
Yeah, or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.
Come on, you can do this.
You don't know what it's like to feel completely frustrated.
To have a-a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.
Yeah, sounds like a drag.
Okay, help me out here.
Why does he love this show so much?
Well, there was action, it was funny.
I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?
Yippee, it's backwards.
I get it.
Why does this bother you so much?
I don't know.
It's just, he's so passionate about so many different things.
I just don't get that way.
Do you?
Well, sure.
I'm pretty passionate about science.
I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms.
It was like a whole other universe.
If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.
See?
I wish I had some of that fire in my life.
I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.
Well, there's no reason you can't.
You think?
Absolutely.
All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you're passionate about.
That sounds like a lot of work.
Hey, what's up?
Uh, Lucy's coming over.
I need some advice.
However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it.
Just tell me which one you think is more manly.
This hockey jersey or this football jersey.
I don't know.
Go with hockey.
Good-- black is more slimming.
Oh, that's her.
I got to go be butch.
Toodles.
Hey.
Hi.
Come in.
Oh, look how cute your little doggy is.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't get too close.
If I give the right command in German, she'll rip your face off.
O'er the land of the free And the home Of the Next.
That's quite an impressive layout, isn't it?
Yes.
Let's box it up.
"Let's box it up".
That's enough.
Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!
Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles.
Oops, missed one.
Now your wish can't come true.
Lucky for you, 'cause I wished you were dead.
I like your jersey.
Thanks.
I love hockey.
Oh, cool.
So does my dad.
We watched it all the time growing up.
Who's your favorite player?
Not Brian Boitano, that's for sure.
How's your burrito?
It's still a little frozen in the middle.
Probably because I didn't read the instructions.
No wrapper's going to tell me what to do.
Unless his name is Jay-Z.
Is something going on?
What do you mean?
Well, you're acting all weird.
And I'm pretty weird, so I think I know what I'm talking about.
I don't know.
Maybe it's all those steroids I've been taking.
I think I'm gonna go.
Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks.
Wait, wait.
I-I found your blog where you wrote about me.
Oh.
I kind of just write that for myself.
I didn't think anybody actually read it.
No kidding.
You didn't make it easy to find.
I spent hours digging around online.
For the record, you have excellent credit scores.
And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.
Why were you acting so strange tonight?
You called me feminine.
And I I wanted you to think I was more manly.
Raj, I didn't say "feminine" was a bad thing.
I meant that you're sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face.
I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturizing regimen.
So, are you okay?
Yeah.
Good.
Do you even like hockey?
No.
Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.
So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.
The "Harmony One" was fine.
We didn't need to upgrade to the 1100, which he knows is too big for my hand.
See, that's the kind of passion I didn't think I had.
But then I realized I'm passionate about you.
Oh my cute little tushy strikes again.
No, I'm serious.
Look, I've always had these plans.
I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn't worth getting excited about.
Those things can still happen.
Oh, obviously it's gonna happen.
Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so.
Anyway, what I meant was I shouldn't wait, you know?
I've got you, I've got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends.
My life is exciting right now.
That's a big deal.
It is, isn't it?
So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?
Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.
Amy, I must say, I was skeptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.
I'm a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.
Well, you're an excellent neuroscientist, you're a wonderful girlfriend, and And?
Doesn't matter, does it?
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.
And a complete sucker.
Oh, yeah.
There he is.
And the home of the brave Don't stop.
Yes, keep going.
Just like that.
Almost there, almost there.
Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that you're in my life.
I love you, too.
Hello.
Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas?
Oh, smashing.
Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself.
Yeah, now, down to business.
Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger.
Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it?
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
I see.
Well, that all stinks.
No wonder you got canceled.
Bye.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
The interface is pretty simple.
You put your horizontal "X" coordinate here, vertical "Y" coordinate here.
When you're happy with those, you press this button.
Got it.
Leonard, you'll never guess who I just found online-- Hey!
Nice shot.
Eh, his giant head did most of the work.
Very mature.
You're lucky I'm out of Silly String.
As I was saying, Leonard, you'll never guess who I just found online: Professor Proton.
You're kidding.
He's still alive?
Yes!
Who's Professor Proton?
He was the host of this great-- Hey!
Yes!
Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.
Professor Proton hosted my favorite science show when I was a child.
I never missed an episode.
He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
It was pretty cool.
Aw, so cute when you use the word "cool" wrong.
Like when kids say "pasghetti".
Oh, dear Lord!
Leonard, look!
He's still available for parties and events.
We should hire him.
Hire him to do what?
Well, whatever we want.
Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.
It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him.
I just used "awesome" wrong, didn't I?
Well, I'm e-mailing him right now.
Do you remember his old theme song?
Of course I do.
Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on Here he comes, Professor Proton.
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend.
Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?
Why don't you put her in a kennel?
Why don't you put your mother in a home?
To be honest, she'd do better in the kennel.
I'll talk to Bernie.
I'm sure it's fine.
Thank you.
It's happening!
It's happening!
Professor Proton is coming to our house.
You're kidding!
You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?
And you just got yourself uninvited.
See?
I told you I'd find a tactful way to do that.
How'd you get him to come to your house?
As Professor Proton always says, "There is no problem you can't solve if you use your noggin".
And he wrote him a check.
Yeah, that, too.
Big check.
Uncle Howard!
Cinnamon's here for her sleepover party!
You know if you had a stroke, she'd eat you, right?
And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?
It's very simple.
For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata.
Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both.
We're watching our weight.
Uh, for dinner, something simple-- a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.
Classy dog.
Yes.
Also, don't forget to close the toilet or she'll drink out of it.
I feel for ya.
I've got a psychotic mommy, too.
Leonard, are you in bed?
Yes.
Me, too.
Great.
I can't sleep.
Well, I can, so shut up.
Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?
Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you're gonna be sleepy tomorrow.
And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon.
And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon.
Good night!
I'm thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
That's not ridiculous.
Good night.
Do you have cufflinks?
No.
Ah, just as well.
Where can you rent a tuxedo at 3:00 in the morning?
Okay, good night.
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton.
Nice to meet you, Prof Ow!
Leonard?
What?
I still can't sleep.
She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?
Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.
It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.
And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn't wear out her tiny legs.
Yeah, that's what I was doing.
You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.
Really?
Yeah.
I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.
Of course we can.
Especially if our baby's as calm and quiet as little Cinna Son of a bitch, she's gone!
Where'd she go?
!
I don't know!
She didn't leave a note!
You were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller!
No, I wasn't!
You were!
No, I wasn't!
Yes, you were!
Yeah, well, you throw like a girl!
I'm getting worried.
Relax, Sheldon, he's only a few minutes late.
Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV.
You know, every day, 4:00, he was there.
Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case, we'd join him in progress.
It's him.
Hello.
Well, I see.
Yes.
All right, we can come get you.
Yeah, well, see you soon.
Bye.
Where is he?
The third floor landing.
The poor old guy's been walking up the stairs for half an hour.
It's really you.
Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry.
We should've told you about the broken elevator.
I agree.
Professor Proton, it's an honor to meet you.
Just-just call me Arthur.
Leonard you hear that?
Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur.
That means we're friends.
No.
A friend would've-would've told me about the elevator.
Look at me.
I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it's going to ruin my eyes.
Is, uh, is he dangerous?
Actually, he's a genius.
I am.
Th-That doesn't answer my question.
Mr. Jeffries, I'm-I'm Leonard.
This is my girlfriend, Penny.
Hi.
Hello.
Well, I hope I haven't kept the kids waiting too long for-for the show.
Oh, no, there are no kids.
No, the-the show's for me.
Come on.
I'll race ya Arthur.
Is the, is the blonde girl really your-your girlfriend?
Yes, sir.
You're the genius.
So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?
It-It's hard to say.
I'm-I'm still trying to figure out what what-what this is.
We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
Well, there-there really isn't too much to tell.
After the TV show was-was canceled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously.
So I was forced to do these, uh, children's parties to-to make a living.
That's too bad.
But still, working with kids-- it must be rewarding.
You-you get bit a lot.
Let me see if-if I have this straight.
You-you two are-are physicists, and-and you, and you want me to do a children's science show?
Yes.
And if there's time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.
You know, I'm a real scientist.
I-I have a PhD from Cornell University.
Yeah, that's great.
Did you bring your puppet?
No, no.
I-I hate that puppet.
Oh, no.
How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino?
It's nice, huh?
I got him for Including a-shipping!
I'm I'm awake, right?
Th-This is happening?
Cinnamon!
Cinnamon!
You know, maybe she doesn't recognize her name because of Raj's accent.
Good thinking.
Cinnamon, come to Daddy!
Cinnamon!
Where are you, my little lamb chop?
Nice.
Thanks.
When this all blows over, remember that voice.
It's kind of a turn-on.
It turns you on when I sound like Raj?
Cinnamon!
Okay, as-as I put the egg on top, and-and the flame goes out and-and the air pressure decreases in-in the flask, what do you think will happen?
I think I know.
It's gonna get sucked in.
It's going to get sucked in.
Okay, I didn't know.
Yes!
See, I'm not a scientist like them.
I-I figured that out.
Uh, potato clock.
Do potato clock.
What's that?
I-I power a clock with a, with a potato.
Shut up!
You can do that?
I mean wouldn't that solve the world's energy crisis?
No.
Look, guys, keep your money.
I-I think, uh I-I think I'm done.
What-what's wrong?
Is she upsetting you?
Because I can make her go away.
No, sh-she's the only reason I've-I've stayed this long.
Then what is it?
I don't know.
I think I'm just I-I just, I just don't want to be Professor Proton anymore.
Well, how can you say that?
Professor Proton's the best.
What-what has it ever gotten me?
I mean, I'm-I'm an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in-in his suitcase.
Other scientists think-think I'm a joke.
And the the puppeteer who did, who did Gino well, he also did my wife.
Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something.
I'm sorry to hear about your troubles.
Uh, thanks.
But if you don't mind me asking, uh, the potato clock-- how does it work?
Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?
Wh-What do you two talk about?
I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me.
Do you remember that?
I'll-I'll give you a hint: I have a bracelet with my own address on it.
Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn't have any friends growing up.
No, I-I get that.
But, um, I did have you.
And every day at 4:00, you'd come to my house on Channel 68, and we'd do science together.
If it hadn't been for you, well, who knows what would've become of me?
You know?
Instead of a world-class physicist, I could've wound up as a-a hobo.
Or a surgeon.
I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science.
In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.
Yeah, it's true.
A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.
Well, thank-thank you, guys.
That that-that means a lot.
Well, it's important you know how much you mean to us.
Uh-oh.
Arthur, are you okay?
I'm having a problem with my pacemaker.
I'll-I'll call for help.
Any chance we could plug it into the potato?
No.
Hello?
What do you mean, you found my dog?
She's with my friends.
Is she okay?
Oh, thank you.
Uh, just text me your address; I'm on my way.
Oh, and if she's hungry, go ahead and feed her.
But do not give her anything starchy.
She's having risotto for dinner.
Your vitals are stable, but let's take you in for some tests just to be safe.
You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
I'll do it!
He's not a relative, he's not allowed, right?
No, that's not a rule.
He can go.
Oh, yeah!
I can't catch a break today.
We'll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
I'm sorry things turned out this way.
Well, at-at this point, I'm just glad someone's carrying me down the stairs.
Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance.
Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this'll be the best day ever.
Can't believe we lost her.
What was I thinking?
I'd be a terrible mom.
Well, maybe with the first one.
But kids are like pancakes.
The first one's always a throwaway.
How's this look?
It's fine.
Where'd you get that picture of her?
It's not her.
I just Googled "foo-foo little dogs".
It's Raj.
Stay quiet.
Hey!
Bad timing.
Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.
Hmm.
Interesting.
Did they take a walk down Liars' Lane?
What?
A lane frequented by liars.
Like you, you big liar!
You have her?
Oh, thank God she's okay.
Well, I trusted you, and you let me down.
The poor thing's been shaking for hours.
I'm really sorry.
Hang on, you've had her for hours?
Yes.
I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down.
And then we got Pinkberry.
So you knew she was okay, and you couldn't pick up the phone to tell us?
Well, I-I thought about Don't "well" me, mister!
We've been worried sick!
She could have been dead for all we knew!
You should be ashamed of yourself!
Sorry.
I-I just Sorry's not good enough!
Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you've done!
Nice guilt trip.
You are gonna be an amazing mom.
Soft kitty, warm kitty Little ball of fur Happy kitty, sleepy kitty Purr, purr, purr.
Thank you, Sheldon.
That-that was very nice.
Want me to sing it again?
No.
The fourth, the fourth time was-was the charm.
There anything I can get for you?
Some apple juice?
Uh, some Jell-O?
No.
No, thank you.
But I-I do I do have a favor to-to ask.
Name it.
Well, I'm-I'm booked to do a children's party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I-I don't feel up to it.
Oh, you're not.
You look awful.
Th-Thank you.
Anyway, uh I mean, you know my act better than anybody.
I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you'd fill in for me.
Wha Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
Yeah.
Oh, my.
What an honor.
Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.
Or a Korean family in Alhambra.
But they'll know I'm not you.
Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?
Sounds great.
So, in a way it's like I'm your son.
What-Whatever.
Father.
Sure, what the hell?
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Burbank Airport, please.
Vegas, here we come!
No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules.
No rules?
We're not gonna get drunk and have a six-way with the Blue Man Group, are we?
No.
So there are some rules.
Fine.
No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules.
Thank you.
Vegas!
The ladies are away, the boys will play.
Anything can happen.
It's gonna get crazy.
Dungeons & Dragons!
I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these.
I got a sexy new tube top that says "Come hither" and a can of pepper spray that says "Close enough, Jack".
I got some old underwear I'm gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert.
I'm sorry, why old?
'Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing.
I've got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice.
Hello, new dice smell.
I've got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma.
I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him.
And I had a sensible salad for lunch, so I can eat all the pizza I want.
Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play D & D like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?
!
Vegas!
Vegas!
Vegas!
The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko!
The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko!
The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko!
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
I'm actually glad Lucy had to work tonight.
Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.
Isn't every conversation you two have awkward?
Eh?
Painfully so.
We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up.
So into her.
Ready whenever you guys are.
Yeah, yeah, we'll be right there.
Yeah, Leonard Yeah?
I'm not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.
Oh, that's nice.
But relax, sometimes change is good.
Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.
Oh, please.
Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face.
I'm upset the mailman has a new haircut: Zachary Quinto.
I'm upset that daylight saving time started: Zachary Quinto.
I'm upset daylight saving time ended: Zachary Quinto.
I'm saying this for the last time: Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event.
So stop using him against me.
Okay, here we go.
You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest.
Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage.
He says, "Travel with caution.
"These woods are home to the bones "of many a fallen hero"!
See, Howard's just as good a dungeon master as I am.
As good?
You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.
Hey, come on, guys, focus.
Um, uh Oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal.
Oh, Lucy's free after all.
See ya.
Hey, hey, hey, you can't leave.
We just started.
You're right, I should finish the game.
I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it.
I'm dead, I've got a date with a girl.
Bye.
We'll be fine, watch.
Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali's bloody corpse, and says, "Don't worry, buddies, "Ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest".
"Well, I'm just "a tree, but if I were you, I'd listen to your ghost friend"!
Go on, give him your lunch money.
I'm very happy you were able to hang out tonight.
Me, too.
Not that it's up to you to make me happy.
Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy.
In which case, you're about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.
Can I tell you something?
I was so nervous about seeing you, before I left my apartment, I put roll-on antiperspirant all over my body.
Really?
Yeah.
If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, you'll know why.
I, uh, I'm sorry to put you through that.
Oh, it's okay.
I've been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared.
What else have you been thinking about doing?
Well, let's see.
I'd love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don't like bangs.
I like your bangs.
Oh, thanks, I like 'em, too.
What else?
Mm it's kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.
Mm, yeah.
Those are both toughies.
I know.
I have a two-year subscription to Guns & Ammo.
I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
Uh it does.
He does sound effects, too!
Hey, I always did sound effects.
A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon.
Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn.
Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects.
Guess who!
What are you doing back?
That's an excellent question.
Amy?
Uh, well when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down.
The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy I may have broken her nose with my elbow.
Long story short, she's on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone.
I'm sorry.
I feel like such an idiot.
Oh, it's not so bad.
You lost money, you're filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger.
I mean, that's Vegas, you nailed it.
You guys enjoy your evening.
I'm gonna go before I ruin anybody else's weekend.
That's my girl.
No, no.
Amy, wait.
Uh, uh, I know it's not the night you had in mind, but why don't you guys stay and play with us?
It'll be fun.
It would-- fun?
Yeah, okay, three weeks ago, you bought crunchy peanut butter, but now you want the girls to play D & D-- do you have a drug problem?
What's the big deal?
Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.
Well, I've just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.
No one has.
So, what do you say?
I'll leave it up to the dungeon master.
Yeah, a satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says, "You're playing D & D. "You're playing D & D. "This whole apartment is playing D & D." Okay, who wants a drink?
Yeah, we-- now, Penny, we don't consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons.
It impairs our judgment.
Oh, this isn't alcohol.
It's a magic potion that makes me like you.
Double potion, please.
Okay, here we go.
You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres.
"What are you doing "in our dungeon?
You shall die"!
Okay, literal goose bumps.
Look.
What do you do?
I draw my broadsword.
I ready my quarter-staff.
I drink my potion.
- I say we attack the big one.
- You know what?
Give me the dice, I want to roll.
Well, the dungeon master's supposed to roll.
Yeah, well I'm supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet.
Now give it.
All right, what do I need?
Uh, 15 or higher.
Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out.
Sixteen!
Yes!
Oh, please tell me we're playing for money.
Oh, even better than money.
You gained experience points.
More potion, please.
Yeah.
How are your crab cakes?
Kind of funky.
That's great.
It is?
Does "funky" mean something different in India?
No, no.
Uh, you've always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant; here's your chance.
Mm.
It's okay.
I just won't eat 'em.
Don't be ridiculous.
Waiter?
Everything all right?
Uh yeah.
Everything all right with you?
Yes.
'Kay, thanks, bye.
Hold on.
Isn't there something else you wanted to tell him?
N-No, it-it's fine.
Uh He's from a different country; he doesn't understand our ways.
Don't be silly.
Just tell him.
I have to go to the bathroom.
And it's not because the crab cakes are funky.
So you're okay here?
Uh, yeah, sorry.
She's just a little shy.
The-the first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.
Uh-oh.
Hey, Raj.
Funny story.
Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres!
The-the other ogre says, "You killed my brother.
Now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined".
That is amazing.
He made me care about the ogre!
All right, Amy, there's one ogre left.
Take him out!
Okay.
Pretend he's that TSA agent.
Come on.
Nineteen!
Yes!
This is turning out to be even better than Vegas!
No, it's not!
Lucy?
Oh, hey.
Long time no see.
You don't know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity.
I'm sorry.
Why would you leave like that?
You were pushing me; I clearly didn't want to send my food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway.
Okay, if I upset you, then why didn't you just say something?
Well, how can I tell you I'm upset if I can't tell the woman at Supercuts that my forehead's my best feature?
It's scary.
Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that's scary for me.
Mostly because you're a proven flight risk.
How could you like me a lot?
Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman!
I-I don't know.
I just I think you're wonderful.
I'm sweating out of my head.
The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano!
But wait!
He's not dead.
He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.
Yeah, uh, wait!
Doesn't he say something first?
You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?
Fine.
"You'd think, after all these years, "I'd know not to fly over volcanoes.
I'm a freaking idiot".
The dragon's Christopher Walken!
That's perfect.
All right, Amy, it's your turn.
We need one more hit.
Finish him off!
Here we go.
Fifteen?
It's a hit.
The dragon collapses to the ground!
Wait.
Wait.
And says "Mother?
"Is that you?
Your little boy is coming home".
Oh, I don't know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.
This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master.
Oh, yeah?
Well, when we get home, I'm gonna take you on a whole different adventure.
Another quest by Wolowitz?
Count me in.
Sheldon, they're talking about sex.
Oh, then I'm out.
Ooh!
I have an idea.
Since it's not happening anytime soon, why don't your character and your character do it in the game?
Ooh!
Come on, back me up here.
Oh.
Ooh!
Ooh!
Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.
Oo Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that The love spell takes effect.
When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he's ever seen, and he's overcome with a desire to rip her armor off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts.
When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks well, just like Sheldon, 'cause apparently she's into that.
What do you do?
I don't like this.
You see what happens when you let girls play D & D?
Amy.
Amy.
Amy.
What?
I've never knocked on my own door before.
That was a wild ride.
You don't have to come in here and cheer me up.
Thank you.
Would you go tell everyone else that?
Because they sure think otherwise.
I'll tell you what they think.
They think our relationship is a joke.
Well, I don't think our relationship is a joke.
I think "a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, 'Why the long face?
'" That's a joke.
It's a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.
Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?
Oh, my.
That's an uncomfortable topic.
Amy fore I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.
And now?
And now what?
Do you have any interest now?
I have not ruled it out.
Wow.
Talk dirty to me.
I know it doesn't seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.
I guess I know that.
It's just part of me wants more.
More?
I mean, look at us.
It's only been three years; here we are in bed together.
Come on.
Let's go back out there.
Y Well, no.
Hold on.
My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them.
We wouldn't really be playing the game right if we didn't see that through.
Okay.
I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon.
While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armor.
It comes off.
Oh.
What do you do?
I kiss you on the lips.
I kiss you back on the lips as well.
Your turn.
I remove your armor.
What do you do?
I erotically caress your nose.
Keep rolling.
Hey, you guys have been in there for a while.
- You doing okay?
- We're fine, thank you.
Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about Go away!
Sheldon is nibbling on my
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, into Lucy's eyes.
Oh, that sounds romantic.
It was until I realized the screen had frozen.
Still one of my top three dates of all time.
So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?
I'd love that, but she's not really comfortable around people.
Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick.
I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.
How's that been working for you?
Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.
Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.
I have a job.
Yes, he does.
He caters to my every whim.
No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking's team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes.
One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you.
Well, do you really think I have a shot?
Yeah, I've worked with Hawking.
I talked you up.
He knows your research.
I think this could happen.
He knows-- Wow!
Well, now, but do you think that's a good idea?
Uh, you know Star Trek.
Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?
Hey, don't discourage him.
This is a fantastic opportunity.
No one asked you, Uhura.
Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?
What do you think?
Great.
I've been doing some reading about vehicular safety.
Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.
Well, that's the thing about factoids-- they're interesting.
I know what you're doing.
You don't want me going on this research trip because you're afraid to be alone.
I'm not afraid to be alone.
On land.
On the sea, it would be terrifying.
Because of all the drowning.
Sheldon.
Fine, no more drowning talk.
I'll change the subject.
Oh.
Who do you think would win in a fight-- you or a shark?
Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness.
If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that's going to stop me.
Very well.
Things between you and Penny have never been better.
I hope four months apart doesn't change anything.
I should have opened with that, huh?
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait!
The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang!
If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.
Wow.
Your friend was actually up there?
Yeah.
He brought me back a T-shirt that said, "My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt"" Did he take the T-shirt to space?
Nope.
It's exactly as lousy as advertised.
Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you.
I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?
I don't know.
How many are there?
Let's see.
Six.
That's pretty cool; I have six friends!
Kind of like Sinatra.
Six strangers?
That's a lot of pressure.
Staring at me, asking me personal questions.
Like, "What do you do"" "Where are you from"?
"Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom"?
Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?
Will you be there?
Of course.
Well, that's two.
Three if you count me.
Oh, this is getting out of hand.
So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.
Oh, that's awful.
Not really.
My shirt was soaking wet.
I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.
Oh.
So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?
I thought I said that to you.
Anyway, Stephen Hawking's team is looking into that, and I've been invited to join them.
Wow, Hawking!
Good for you!
Well, it is.
Just-- you know, I'd be gone for a while.
Well, how long?
Three, four months.
Whoa.
When would you leave?
Couple weeks.
Wow.
O-Okay, well, I'll just come visit you.
That's the thing-- you can't.
I'll be on a ship in the North Sea.
On a ship?
Aren't they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?
Uh, he's not gonna be there.
He's just sending a team to research his theory.
Oh, sure.
Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub.
Wow.
Okay.
Four months.
Yeah.
And I'm a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I'd hate to do anything that screws that up.
Oh, sweetie, if you're gonna screw things up, it's gonna be while you're here, not while you're away.
Oh.
No.
I mean, look, you have to go.
It sounds like an amazing opportunity.
And I'm just basing that on how much I didn't understand what you said about it.
Okay.
I'll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.
Okay.
Good.
I do have to ask you one favor.
Sure.
Sheldon's nervous about me leaving.
Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone.
Oh, I don't know.
Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?
Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.
Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.
Are you kidding me?
How often can you say "Bon voyage" to somebody when they're actually going on a voyage?
Hello, Rajesh.
Hello, Amy.
Nice to see you.
What can I say?
It's funnier with the accent.
There's beer in the fridge.
Anyway, you guys really don't need to make a big deal.
Leonard, you're being selfish.
We need to give you a proper send-off so we'll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.
Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.
You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left.
Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.
Okay.
I have a request to make.
And now he can talk.
I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck's going on in there.
The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil.
Anyway, I-I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.
Oh, gee, I don't know.
My schedule's a little busy.
Actually, I was thinking Leonard.
Oh.
Thank you, Raj.
I'd be honored.
What the hell?
I thought I was your best friend.
You are, but you've got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.
You know, maybe she'd be more comfortable meeting a girl first.
Good idea.
Bernadette?
What the hell?
!
Well, you're very pretty.
That could be intimidating to another woman.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, you don't think I'm pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?
Calm down, Bernie.
You're very scary.
It should be me.
Why?
So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
A, that was not a joke.
That was a sincere request.
And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be.
But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.
Fine, I'll do it.
So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and they've all been so wonderful to me.
That's really nice to hear.
Maybe next week, we could all get together.
Oh, Lucy, you don't have to answer that.
Don't put her on the spot.
She hates that.
Am I right?
Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot.
Go ahead, tell her.
Ignore him.
He's a little nervous 'cause he doesn't think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.
What the?
Are you crazy?
You can't talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety.
It makes them socially anxious!
Excuse me, but I'm a neurobiologist.
I think I'm a little more qualified than you to understand what's not working in your girlfriend's brain!
Don't call her my girlfriend.
We haven't discussed whether or not we're girlfriend or boyfriend yet.
Now that it's out there are you my girlfriend?
By the way, if you say no, I'll never be happy again.
Not to put you on the spot.
I think I have to go to the bathroom.
We might as well go ahead and eat.
She's not coming back anytime soon.
This is ridiculous.
We're shopping for a party.
This store doesn't even have a party section.
Yeah, it does, and here we are.
You know, I have to say, Penny, I don't understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.
Well, I'm his girlfriend; of course I'm gonna support him.
Yeah, well, you're his girlfriend for now.
You know, maybe you're not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other's arms and britches.
Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay?
He gets to work with Stephen Hawking.
Who, by the way, will not be on the boat.
I checked it out.
It's not that big of an opportunity.
And even if Hawking's theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be.
I mean, me?
I'm interested in the big questions.
Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.
I'm not jealous.
I'm just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.
Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay?
But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn't take anything away from you.
You know what?
Let me tell you a little story.
Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn't very good at her job.
It was you.
It wasn't me.
But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial.
She got it.
Look, I was so jealous.
But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
I looked her in the eye, smiled and said, "I'm happy for you".
Because that's what friends do.
They lie so they don't look petty.
Yeah.
How?
Like this.
I am so happy for you.
Wow.
No wonder you didn't get that toothpaste commercial.
Hey.
Hi.
I want to apologize for Amy last night.
She was completely out of line.
Are you are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?
Amy wasn't the problem.
Okay.
I know.
It was me.
I-I pushed too hard.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
You know, I-I've been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party.
A party?
A little one!
It's-it's a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him.
If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won't even know you're there.
I'm not sure.
Oh, please?
Raj.
Come on.
Don't make me beg.
And I'm from India, so I know how to do it.
Okay.
Y Thank you!
Th-This means a lot to me.
My friends are like my family.
Unless you don't like them; in which case, they're dead to me.
So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?
Yeah.
Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?
Yeah.
I'm proud of you, Leonard.
Working out on the North Sea for months-- that's really something.
I know.
As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.
Maybe your lifetime.
I went to space.
It's not a competition.
You're right, you're right.
I'm really proud of you, and I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
And space beats water.
Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.
She is.
She's just running a little late.
You know how it is-- girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup.
She'll be here.
Just give it a rest, okay?
Um, can I have your attention, everyone?
That's, uh, B-flat, for those who don't have perfect pitch.
I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn't be happier for him.
Thank you, Sheldon.
That must've been very hard for you to say.
Well, I mean it.
I'm really happy for you.
And that's how you get a toothpaste commercial.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.
Mm.
Thank you.
It must've killed you when I went to space.
Oh, no.
Buddy, you okay?
Oh, man.
What's going on?
Uh, go ahead.
Read it.
"Raj, I can't come to the party.
"This is all just "too much for me.
"I don't think we should see "each other anymore.
Sorry.
Lucy".
Excuse me.
Raj, I'm so sorry.
Me, too.
It did not kill me when you went to space.
Monkeys went to space.
Well, here we are.
Yep.
I'm really gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, too.
Penny, we're in the red zone.
The white zone is for loading and unloading.
We're breaking the law.
Okay, there's no space in the white zone, so Anyway, we can e-mail, and I-I think the phone connections are pretty good.
All right, you have to get out of the car right now.
I'm not going to jail for you.
Would you just relax?
Oh, I see a space in the white zone.
Quick, circle the airport.
Did you bring enough inhalers?
Yeah.
And, uh, extra Dramamine?
You remember what happened on It's a Small World.
I'm covered.
Okay.
Oh, dear Lord, a police officer's glancing in our direction.
We've been made.
Calm down.
I'm getting out.
I have something I want to give you.
Oh, Leonard.
It's just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard's face in it.
He got it at the mall on clearance.
Now move, move, move!
I love you.
I love you, too.
Don't worry, Officer.
They just love each other.
We're not smuggling drugs.
Raj, it's Penny.
Are you in there?
Hang on.
Hey.
I'm just coming back from the airport.
I wanted to see how you're doing.
That's-that's very nice of you.
Uh, come, come.
Come on in.
Can't stay long.
I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open.
He's gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so Are you okay?
No.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
No.
It's my fault.
You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I-I drove her away.
Oh, Raj.
Penny, I I miss her already.
I know how you feel.
I miss Leonard, too.
What's what is wrong with me?
Why-why can't I ever have love?
You will.
No, I I won't.
I'm-I'm unlovable.
That's just the booze talking.
No, it's not.
I haven't had a drink since last night.
You're talking to me.
I am.
And now I'm crying for a whole different reason!
Me, too!
So I-I guess what I'm saying is.
I get where Lucy's coming from.
That's great.
Do you want some wine?
Uh, no, water's fine.
Anyhow, I-I've been thinking about it a lot, and-and I totally see why Lucy did what she did.
I pushed too hard.
But you know what?
If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there's still a future for us.
Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes Does he ever shut up?
at least my heart is starting to heal.
Slowly but surely.
And how I cried.
It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face.
But I'm a man, okay?
So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal.
I mean, it's not all bad, right?
Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you so, you know, it was a silver lining.
