{START OF EPISODE 1}
Malcolm: This is the world-- If I covered 1 00 square miles an hour every hour for the rest of my life I'd still only see half of it.
This is the left nostril of my brother Reese.
It squeaks all night long.
These are the freezing cold feet of my little brother Dewey.
This is my oldest brother Francis.
He's the one I really like so, of course, he got sent to military school.
My name is Malcolm.
You want to know what the best thing about childhood is?
At some point, it stops.
Malcolm, Reese, Dewey, get in here!
- Stop!
- I'm not touching you!
There's only two toaster waffles.
One of you has to have cereal.
It's mine!
Come on!
Give it!
You cheated!
Give it!
Give it!
Huh, look at this.
They're sending an unmanned probe to Venus and letting a bunch of schoolchildren name it.
That's going to end badly.
These clippers are dull already.
Honestly, Hal, you're like a monkey.
They do this every month.
He has sensitive skin.
The hair gets itchy under his clothes.
It always seems like such a shame to just dump this in the trash.
Maybe birds would like to make nests with it or maybe you boys could use it for school projects.
Arms up.
Dude.
Malcolm, come right home from school.
I made a play date for you with Stevie Kenarban and you have to take a bath.
What?
Mom, no!
Malcolm has a play date?
!
Shut up, Reese!
With Stevie ''The Wheelie'' Kenarban?
Oh, man!
Breathing.
So, Malcolm, why is playing a problem?
First off I don't even know Stevie.
His mother said you boys ate lunch together.
One time.
He rolled his wheelchair over next to me.
It's not like I could say, ''Go away.
'' He's not even in my class.
He's in the Krelboyne class in the trailer next to tetherball.
You listen to me, young man.
That one lunch obviously meant a lot to Stevie.
He's a human being with human feelings.
Now, you are going to be friends with that crippled boy and you are going to like it.
Understood?
Yes, ma'am.
Understood.
If I give up now, I won't get the lecture.
You kids Dang.
You just take your legs for granted like nothing could ever happen to them.
That is just wishful thinking.
There's meningitis.
There are car accidents.
I could be giving you a spanking and accidentally snap your spinal cord.
Every day is a lottery and first prize is that you don't have to scoot yourself around town on a skateboard with your hands.
You think about that.
I don't take my legs for granted, Mom.
I know, honey.
You're a good boy.
Stop playing with yourself.
Go on,just go.
Lois: No, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, I ran out of ham.
One of you has to have egg salad, okay?
And don't ditch your little brother.
I don't want him getting kidnapped.
Yeah, Mom, that would be terrible.
It's your turn to walk with him.
I walked him yesterday and the day before.
I walked with him when he wet his pants.
Okay.
Mom said to hold hands.
She did not say to hold hands, Dewey.
I'm not holding hands.
Come on, hold hands.
Please?
No!
You're in the first grade.
You're too big for that.
Look, I'm walking right next to you.
You'll be fine.
Damn it!
This is why everyone teases you.
Hey, Malcolm.
Hey, Richard.
So my mom was telling my dad last night about your brother.
She said he's in jail.
He's not in jail.
He's at Marlin Academy.
It's, like, one of the best private schools in the country and it's totally unfair.
Everyone acts like Francis is just this big troublemaker and he's not.
Dad, I know what you're going to say and believe me, I totally agree with you.
There is no excuse for what I did.
It was idiotic, immature, totally reckless and I'm really sorry.
I'm just I'm hoping against hope that you will give me another chance, which, I admit I don't deserve but if you could just find it in your heart to forgive me I know I could earn your trust back.
It's not like it was even our car.
Spath, Spath, Spath!
Spath: All right here's how it works.
You can beg for mercy on your belly lick the bottom of my shoes or take a beating.
You must pick at least two but but-but, if you pick three you get a pass for the next two weeks.
All right?
Now, that's your best value.
Malcolm: Dave Spath.
He never gets sent anywhere.
What do you do if he catches you?
Roll in a ball.
What if he starts kicking you?
Stay in a ball.
Okay.
Come on.
Wait.
Never mind.
Woman: Those of you finished with your tempera paints may bring your work up here and start on your charcoal still lifes.
You may take two pieces of fruit only and please be careful with them.
I bought them with my own money.
My own money.
God, Malcolm, that's so good.
Oh, Malcolm, this is wonderful.
The perspective is good.
The composition is clean and it even shows signs of actual technique.
I have to say this is the high point of my day.
How's that for sad?
Are you okay?
Um, yeah, I'm fine.
Hogan: Malcolm.
What?
They need to see you in the office.
Okay.
I think they mean right now.
Okay.
Get up, Malcolm.
Hi.
I'm Caroline.
Want to have a seat?
Are you Malcolm?
Yes, and I didn't do anything.
You're not in trouble, Malcolm.
You're here 'cause some of your teachers think you're, um You know what?
I just want to play some games with you.
Puzzles, stuff like that.
Why?
Boy, oh, boy you are a suspicious little dickens, aren't you?
Now, you can look at this picture for 60 seconds and I want you to tell me everything that's wrong with it, okay?
The man only has four fingers.
Right, but this time I want you to take your time and really look The car shadow's going the wrong way the steering wheel's on the wrong side there's no brake pedal the words in the mirror should be backwards the guy's watch wouldn't say 1 2:00 if he's looking at a sunset and I have red paint on my ass.
That's right.
Red paint all over my ass!
These are good cookies.
: Yeah they're good.
So what can you do?
I mean, what do you want to do?
I know a joke.
Yeah?
Okay.
A guy goes into a bar and he has a frog on his Frog on his head.
On his head.
And the bartender Wait, I screwed up.
A frog goes into a bar.
You want to watch TV?
Can't.
Not allowed.
What?
You mean, ever?
Mom says TV makes you stupid.
No, TV makes you normal.
How can they do that?
He's in a wheelchair.
So what do you do all day, homework?
Mostly read comics.
You have comic books?
Whoa!
You really have Youngblood, number one?
Want to read it?
No way.
I'd wreck it.
Oh did you read the last Savage Dragon when they split him in two?
Yeah.
Brilliant.
I like how he never has to learn a lesson or anything.
He just gets to pound on everyone.
You're under galactic arrest.
Think again, space flatfoot.
You cannot escape.
Give up or be annihilated.
Saturday morning is the only thing my family does better than anyone else.
Damn!
You boys, you keep this house clean till your dad comes home.
Two of you can have slices of pizza for lunch.
The other one can have I don't know.
I think they're peas.
Somebody get that.
- Not it.
- Not it.
Hello.
Young Master Malcolm.
Francis, hi.
Hey, man I wrote you guys a really long letter yesterday but, listen, they only gave me, like, three minutes so would you put the special prosecutor on?
Mom, it's Francis.
Hey, Francis, how's school?
Oh, couldn't be better, Mom.
My new roommate showed me how to kill mice with a hammer yesterday, so, you know, between that and the general atmosphere of simmering homoeroticism I think I'm really starting to turn around.
Honey, it's only until summer.
Come on, push it!
Give it up, prom date.
Yeah, listen, um I know I shouldn't ask but would you be able to send me my allowance like, a couple of weeks early 'cause I kind of need some?
Oh, my God!
Are you smoking?
What?
You're smoking.
I can hear you smoking.
You're smoking, aren't you?
Mom, I'm not smoking.
Geez.
After seeing the anguish your father and I went through to quit didn't any of that register with you?
Okay, listen.
I'll talk to your dad.
Maybe we can send you part of it.
Honey, I have to go.
I'm late for work.
I'll call you later.
Okay, thanks, Mom.
I love you.
Oh I love you.
He's so lucky.
I know.
We never go anywhere.
He gets to be in Alabama.
Is Alabama nice?
Look it up, Dewey.
It's got Sequoia Caverns the biggest cast-iron statue in the world.
Plus it's right next to Florida where Disney World is.
I bet he goes to Disney World all the time.
Hey, moron, he's 1 6.
He doesn't do kid stuff.
He goes to parties, drinks beer and goes skiing.
Right, genius.
They do lots of skiing in Alabama.
- Shut up!
- You shut up!
- No, you shut up!
- Make me!
I'll make you right--  Not my face!
You'd better not be fighting in there, Reese, Malcolm!
I said, you better not be fighting--  For crying out loud!
Reese!
Malcolm!
Yes.
Can I help you?
Oh.
My good um, hi.
Hel hello.
I'm.
Are you?
I'm Caroline Miller from Malcolm's school.
I sent you some letters and left some messages on your answering machine.
Okay, fine.
You caught me.
What do you want?
Um well, it's been three weeks and you haven't responded and it's really important I mean, well, for Malcolm's sake that the parents be as involved in So you're here to insult my parenting skills?
No.
I'm sure you're a terrific parent.
Who's the baby now?
I'm here because I think that there is a tremendous opportunity for Could you, you know, maybe put a top on?
They're just boobs, lady.
You see them in the mirror every morning.
I'm sure yours are a lot nicer than mine.
That's actually not Let me tell you something else.
The reason I didn't respond is because it is a load of crap.
What?
You are not going to stick my Malcolm in some special ed class.
What is it with you people?
Why do you have to label everybody?
Malcolm may be a little strange and, I know, I know, he never shuts up but he is not disturbed.
You know, he is a good boy Please!
You know what?
You don't understand at all, okay?
So if I could just come in for a minute I could explain everything, okay?
Reese: Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Good, hon.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's something we have to talk about.
I thought we weren't going to mention that until after the biopsy.
It's not that.
It's about Malcolm.
I didn't do it.
He did it.
I saw him.
A teacher from school came by and she ran some tests with Malcolm.
He has an IQ of 1 65.
Who?
Malcolm.
He's a genius.
He's going to a special class.
What?
Malcolm's special?
Where do you think that came from?
They have a special program for gifted children.
They have advanced textbooks and devoted teachers and good things they don't want to waste on normal kids.
You start on Monday.
In the Krelboyne class?
Mom, no.
I don't want to.
What are you talking about?
Of course you want to.
No.
I want to stay in my own class.
I don't want to be a Krelboyne.
Mom, seriously, Krelboynes get their butts kicked.
Just stop one minute.
There's nothing wrong with being smart.
And there's nothing wrong with being cut from the herd.
It makes you the one buffalo that isn't there when the Indians run the rest - of them off the cliff.
- Huh?
Mom, this isn't fair.
If I don't want to go, why do I have to?
Because it's not just up to you.
We have to do what's best for you.
Is Malcolm going to Alabama?
Mom, please!
Don't make me go!
Please!
Malcolm, calm down.
But it isn't fair!
That's right.
It isn't fair.
It's the first time anyone in this family has ever been given an edge and you are not going to waste it.
Dad?
Honey?
Well look, honey Malcolm, you see Oh, for crying out loud.
How come there's never any iced tea in this pitcher?
I make a fresh batch every morning and it's gone by the time I get home.
I want a better family!
Malcolm Go get yogurt.
Look at that.
Gone.
Can't you make iced tea?
No!
I don't want to go to a special class.
People think I'm weird enough already.
I know.
I like where I am.
I want to stay.
That's because you don't understand the world yet.
Sweetie, life does not give you a lot of chances to move up even if you deserve it.
Look at your dad and me.
Malcolm, I'm proud of you.
You boys are so lucky.
You have so many gifts that other kids don't have.
And I don't just mean Stevie Kenarban, either.
I mean, look at those Parker boys across the street.
They may be healthy, but honest to God those are the ugliest little boys ever born.
They look like boiled beets, don't you think?
And those Henderson kids?
That electrocuted their dog when they were trying to get free cable.
How smart can they be?
And your friend Richard.
He's not ugly or dumb.
Yes, but he's very effeminate.
Just remember any kid who makes fun of you is a creepy little loser who'll end up working in a car wash.
This shouldn't make me feel better, but it does.
You'll be all right, sweetie.
If you don't make a big deal out of this nobody else will either.
And I just can't say enough about how proud we should all be of Malcolm for getting into the gifted program.
Now Malcolm may not look different than the rest of us but he is.
Very different.
In his brain.
And I think we should recognize him for that.
Bye.
Caroline: All righty, today we are starting a new section on the Peloponnesian War which I know you are all going to love.
Malcolm?
Are you okay?
Uh, yeah.
Fine.
All right.
Excuse me.
Stop staring at me!
Why do they keep doing that?
You're new.
Oh, great.
So I'm the freak of the freak show?
Pi to 50 places.
Mark.
Set.
Go.
Turn around, or I swear to God I'll kill you.
Just chill out.
Don't tell me to chill out.
You chill out.
Nobody can live like this.
- I'm okay.
- Oh, sure.
You're okay because it doesn't make any difference to you.
You've always been a freak.
I used to be normal.
Wait.
Who just said that?
You're going to take that the wrong way aren't you?
You suck.
It's so cool!
Around here, being smart is exactly like being radioactive.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Stevie?
What?
Look I Score!
Hey, Spath!
Why don't you stop being such a buttwipe?
!
All: Ooh.
What'd you call me?
You heard me!
I don't care anymore!
I just don't care, Spath, okay?
Alls you ever do is make everybody miserable!
Except for your little monkey-slaves over there.
Who, by the way, only pretend to like you.
They hate you as much as everyone else does!
And you're just too busy being mean and stupid to ever figure it out!
I keep trying to run, but my legs won't work.
Mom was right: They are important.
Wow.
I don't know about you but the Krelboyne really hurt my feelings.
Hey Go away, Stevie.
It's good you two are friends.
He won't mind sharing his wheelchair.
Okay, this is where something good happens, finally.
So we're going to slow down and make it last as long as possible.
Dude, you hit a cripple.
I didn't mean to I wasn't trying Stevie, I'm sorry.
Ow aah ow!
What's your problem?
I mean, he's in a wheelchair and he has glasses.
So then, the principal comes out and everyone's all talking at once.
So the story he puts together is that Spath attacks Stevie for his lunch and I'm like this hero that stepped in to defend him.
It was beautiful.
Okay, it wasn't funny when Spath started crying.
No, wait, it was.
Dad's hair ugh.
Yeah, I know.
It's gross.
But, hey, if a bunch of birds can make the best out of what they get then so can I. Dewey: Malcolm?
Like having to go to special class.
I can make it work out, right?
Malcolm?
Not now!
Or my family.
We're not the greatest family in the world but we can get better.
I mean, it's not impossible.
Malcolm?
What?
!
Can I get out?
No, stop asking.
So basically, I think everything's going to be okay.
A bug went up my nose.
So what do you want me to do about it?
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
What'd you do?
What?
Don't give me that.
What'd you do?
Nothing.
Mom, I'm trying to study.
Oh.
I'm sure you don't mind if I, uh took a look in here!
Mom, I'm telling you.
We didn't do anything.
Oh, you boys are up to something.
I can smell it.
If you've broken another window, it is going to come out of your-- Are you done?
You want to frisk me?
You just consider yourselves lucky this time.
That was close.
Either she's losing her touch, or we're getting better.
?
?
I don't know?
?
?
?
Can you repeat the question?
?
?
?
?
You're not the boss of me now?
?
?
?
And you're not so big?
?
?
?
You're not the boss of me now?
?
?
?
You're not the boss of me now?
?
?
?
You're not the boss of me now?
?
?
?
And you're not so big?
?
?
?
Life is unfair?
?
?
?
The good thing about being smart is I never have to look up any phone numbers.
The bad thing is no one else in the family ever bothers to remember anything.
Hey, Francis, you told me to remind you about Mom and Dad's anniversary.
Ah, great.
When is it?
Today.
Dude, you're supposed to remind me before so that I can get them something.
That's okay.
We'll put your name on their gift.
Cool.
Thanks.
I owe you one.
No.
You owe me 20.
That's what your share comes to.
You got them an $80 gift?
Uh yeah.
Oh, Craig.
Happy anniversary.
That Hal is one lucky hombre.
You shouldn't have.
Oh, please.
A special gift for a special lady on a special day.
No.
I mean, really, you shouldn't have.
Aren't only husbands supposed to give gifts?
Fine.
Throw it in the trash, then.
Ho-ho-hold on.
Let's see what it is first.
Oh, look at - I've been meaning to try this color.
- I know.
I saw you eyeing it a couple weeks ago.
I didn't know we carried this brand.
We don't.
So where did you see me?
So, big plans for tonight?
What are you going to be wearing?
Oh, it's going to be great.
I have the most perfect red dress.
Took me two months to save up for it, but it was worth it.
Oh, I've been fantasizing about this night forever.
Craig?
Huh?
Yeah, uh, say, Lois, you, uh, you want to catch a movie or something over lunch?
They're playing My Best Friend's Wedding over in Electronics.
- No, thanks.
I-- - Fine.
Forget it.
Oof!
.
I'm okay.
Are you boys almost finished wrapping our present?
I have to meet your father at the restaurant in ten minutes.
More paper.
I get to do the bow.
Why'd she give you the money to buy the gift?
Because she didn't want another karate video.
It's ka-ra-te.
I get to do the bow.
What did we get them anyway?
Picture frame.
Brownnoser.
I get to do the bow.
We're not finished yet.
Yeah, but I get to do the bow.
Finished.
Finally.
No!
I was supposed to do the bow.
You should have said something.
I'm telling.
Mom!
No!
Fire?
Fire?
Fire?
!
Mom!
What?
This is the most stupid, irresponsible, dangerous thing you have ever done.
Is this what you want?
Will we have to identify your charred little bodies through their dental records?
I want a straight answer.
Who did this?
Malcolm did it.
Reese did it.
- I didn't do it!
- I didn't do it!
We're going to the dentist?
Who?
I don't like that one anyway.
No.
No.
Not that one.
?
?
They turn me down They turn me down?
?
?
?
They turn, they turn they turn, they turn?
?
?
?
They, they they, they, they?
?
Who?
It wasn't me.
It was him.
No, it was-- Okay.
Into the hallway.
Think I'm going to puke.
Yeah?
Well, it's going to be the highlight of your evening, because nobody is going anywhere until one of you tells me who.
Everything's all set up?
I believe so, sir.
Table seven?
Chateau Brut '87?
Hors d'oeuvres medley?
Yes, sir.
Oh, geez, one more thing.
I almost forgot.
Uh, my wife always orders lobster, so could you have the chef slip this on the lobster's claw just before you serve it?
She gets such a kick out of stuff like that.
And so do I, for that matter.
Not a problem, sir.
The violinist has our song?
He received the sheet music this morning.
Good.
Good, good, good, good.
You would be surprised how many times I've heard ''Tears of a Clown'' just butchered.
Tell her.
You tell her.
Who?
- Malcolm!
- Reese!
Closer to the wall.
Wait, Mom.
Seriously.
It reeks over here.
I can't help it.
Into the TV room.
Let's go.
?
?
Come on, come on?
?
?
?
Come on, come on?
?
?
?
Come on, come on?
?
?
?
Come on?
?
I'll give you five dollars if you tell Mom you did it.
You tell her.
You did it, 'cause I didn't do it.
I really didn't.
- What are you eating?
- Nothing.
Why don't you guys shut up so I can think of something?
What's there to think of?
There's nothing we can do.
I've never seen Mom so mad.
Me either.
Reese is right.
We're out of our league.
There's only one person who ever had Mom this mad at them and survived.
Hello.
- She has your heads where?
- Under the couch.
All because Reese won't admit he did it.
You admit it.
I didn't do it.
- Neither did I. - Liar.
Chill.
You are not going to get anywhere fighting with each other.
First of all, you all burned the dress.
I didn't.
Hey, you all did it.
You have to stay together.
You have to stay united.
United against who?
My mom.
Nice.
No one broke so far, so you should be proud of yourselves.
- Did she do the toy thing yet?
- Yep.
- Spinning?
- Uh-uh.
Okay.
Good.
I think I know where she's going.
Separate interviews.
Listen, when she gets you alone, she's going to pretend she's on your side.
She's not.
Go ahead.
It's a name brand.
I'm not mad at you.
I know you didn't do this.
You're a good boy.
But I want you to help me find out who did.
This is serious.
One of your brothers could have burned the house down.
And for that, he will be severely punished.
But the one who helps me will be a very happy boy.
And I want that to be you.
'Cause you've always been the best one.
You've always been the best one.
You have always been the best one.
Mom, honestly, I don't know who did it.
I don't know.
Don't know.
Well, I guess you boys think you've got your old mom over a barrel, huh?
Well, we'll just see about that.
If you boys want to play, we can play all night long.
Sir?
Hmm?
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, can I have another vodka martini, please?
Very good.
This time, let's go olive, onion, olive.
Whatever.
W-What's that?
I can't hear you.
She's killing us!
Nice is good, mean is bad ?
?
Don't be mean 'cause mean is bad?
?
?
?
Nice is better than mean?
?
-  - ?
?
Hugs are good, thugs are bad?
?
Why does she have to ruin everything I love?
Francis, I'm just going to tell her I did it.
I know it wasn't me, but anything is better than this.
- Oh, go-- - ?
?
That's bad.
They tried that psych-ops stuff on Noriega.
They said that by the end he wanted to cut his own ears off.
Malcolm, you cannot crack now.
She will own you for the rest of your life.
Now, listen to me, Malcolm.
You have to do exactly what I say.
?
?
Nice is good, mean is bad?
?
?
?
Don't be mean 'cause mean is bad?
?
?
?
Nice is better than mean?
?
?
?
Hugs are good?
?
?
?
Thugs are bad?
?
Don't be a thug 'cause thugs are bad ?
?
Hugs are better than thugs?
?
- ?
?
Smart is good?
?
- Did you see that?
- Hooray!
- Francis is a genius!
Come on!
Sing louder!
Nice is good, mean is bad Don't be mean 'cause mean is bad Nice is better than Oh, your grandmother and all your friends are just going to love this at your next birthday party.
You're kidding me.
Okay,just hang in there.
Give me a minute to think.
Damn, she's good.
Did they crack?
Nah, Dewey faked a stomach cramp.
Bought them some time.
Good man.
Man, if we would have had your mom in 'Nam, there'd be a McDonald's in Hanoi Square right now.
Dude, there is a McDonald's in Hanoi Square.
All right.
Franklin, I'm ready to order.
Are you sure, sir?
Mm-hmm.
You see, in our family we have a saying.
''After an hour, eat without her.
If it's any longer, something's wronger.
'' Very catchy, sir.
Well, when life gives you lemons make lemonade, Franklin.
Do you have any lemonade?
No, sir.
Oh.
Do you have lemons?
Yes, sir.
Well, throw one in another martini and let's hear those specials.
What's she doing?
Can't tell.
Maybe she left.
Yeah, I'm sure she's gone out to buy us all presents.
Hooray.
It's just too quiet out there.
It's driving me crazy.
Maybe we should sing some more.
Shut up, Dewey.
I wonder how many holes are up in those tiles.
You counted all those?
No, you just count one tile's holes across and down.
Multiply it, then multiply it again by the number of tiles.
You're doing that more and more.
Doing what?
That brain thing.
Are you just going to keep getting smarter and weirder?
I don't know.
Well, can you tone it down a little bit?
'Cause I can't keep up with all these butt-kickings.
What are you talking about?
Well, at least twice a day I have to whoop-ass on some kid calling you a weirdo.
Honestly, it's exhausting.
You beat up people 'cause they call me a weirdo?
The last kid, he was a freak anyways.
He was in no position to throw out names.
Thanks.
For what?
Nothing.
Hey.
What am I thinking right now?
I'm smart.
I'm not psychic.
Can you understand what dogs are saying?
No.
I can.
?
?
Oh, boys?
?
I don't know who put you up to this sticking-together garbage, but I don't like it.
Therefore, you have forced me to do something terrible.
Say good-bye to a cherished family member.
Who?
No!
- Mom, no!
- Uh-uh-uh.
Don't you dare.
And don't move a muscle.
Hi, Lois.
Look, Ed, uh, it's 9:00.
I'm a little busy right now.
You see, there is the problem.
It's 9:00 at night and I keep hearing screaming.
Now this didn't sound like your normal screaming.
It was more like killing screaming.
I'm not one to complain-- That's why we like you.
In your room now.
Nice place you got here.
Thank you, sir.
I like to, uh, create an atmosphere.
Did you enjoy your meal, sir?
Well if you can call four olives, two onions and a whole lot of alcohol a meal, then, yes.
Very good, sir.
Uh what have you got in the cologne department?
Um, were you looking for anything in particular?
Well, I've been thinking about a signature scent.
You see, I'd like to leave a room and have people say, ''Boy, it smells like Hal in here'' but in a nice way.
Right.
Yeah.
Uh, let's see you you strike me as a sandalwood.
Sandalwood, huh?
Sandalwood.
Let's give it a smell-see, shall we?
Huh?
Yes.
That's quite nice.
Hit me.
Here we go.
Oh, that's that is quite nice.
Ooh!
You do a service to your craft, sir.
This man is a genius.
Snooty bastard.
You'd think this place would be the great equalizer, huh?
You know, even a king looks like a fool when he's answering nature's call.
Am I right?
Of course I'm right.
Well.
It's been a pleasure.
Oh.
Sorry.
Have a good evening.
Uh, sir.
Yes.
Thank you for making eye contact with me.
Boys, I just, I don't know what to do anymore.
I don't want to punish anyone.
All I want is the truth.
I don't know how things got this far, but I just want it to stop.
Naw, they'll never buy it.
Oh, my God.
Hal.
They saved the TV.
All right!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Beautiful work.
Beautiful.
You have her exactly where you want her-- totally crazy.
Now it's time to take the offensive.
The offensive?
Exactly.
She won't Wait a minute.
Did you hear breathing?
What?
Mom?
Malcolm.
Would you hang up the phone, please?
Hi, Mom.
Happy anniversary.
Not good!
Not good!
What is it?
What?
Mom!
Phone!
Oh!
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
We're gonna die!
That's it.
I got to run away.
Wait!
We can get out of this.
You have to use that brain of yours.
Think.
Think!
All I can think about is how hard he's twisting my nipple.
Ow!
Okay.
Think.
Think.
I got it.
Oh.
Mmm.
Here it is.
That's our song.
- Not our song.
-  Can I have?
Another one I cannot believe you, Francis.
You think you are so clever turning them against me, don't you?
No, Mom.
We did not send you to Marlin Academy so that you can undermine my authority long-distance.
Why did you send me?
Well, it was not so that you could undermine my authority.
And if I am not mistaken, you are undermining my authority.
What are you doing?
Spending your anniversary at home fixating on a stupid dress.
Is that what you wanted to do tonight?
What am I supposed to do, Francis?
Let it go?
Yes.
That is exactly what you should do-- let it go.
But you can't, 'cause you can never let anything go.
I can, too, let things go.
- Fine.
- I can.
- Fine.
- I can!
Okay.
Forget I said anything.
I cannot talk to you anymore.
Ooh, you make me so mad.
Sometimes I just want to break your neck.
Did you get the cookies I sent you?
Yeah, they were great.
Good.
I swear to God, on paper, this was a great idea.
All right, that's it.
Get dressed-- we're going to dinner.
Oh, my God, it did work.
What?
Dinner.
I won't have you boys starving to death.
The last thing I need is a bunch of social workers and reporters tearing up the front lawn.
Now, hurry up before I change my mind.
What about the dress?
I really liked that dress.
Hey, thanks for the ride, Tony.
Any time, Hal!
Hello!
Honey?
Boys?
Anybody home?
Hotcha!
This evening just keeps getting better and better.
Hmm.
Oh!
No.
Okay.
Oh.
Jeezle.
Not again.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
And then there's a big explosion and lots of bubbles.
That's where babies come from.
Oh, well, close enough.
I did the math once.
It turns out every 1 7.4 dinners my family actually has a pleasant meal together.
Hey, look at this.
I made a pea angel.
Oh, you're a pea angel.
Stop playing with your food.
Oh, Mom Don't you dare.
Relax, I wasn't really going to.
Then don't.
I wasn't going to.
Then don't.
Well, don't accuse me of something that I wasn't going to do.
Interesting mood shift.
It would take hours to explain the psychology behind this.
So let me just put it this way: dynamite kid with matches.
You're going to throw that at Mom?
I wasn't going to.
Jeez Louise.
Reese Hal, I can handle this.
Reese, I'm warning you.
I wasn't going to.
But if you think I would, then maybe I should.
Oh, good.
Now he's panicking.
Just put the spoon down and apologize.
Okay, she gave him an out.
Apologize for what?
I wasn't going to do anything.
Just stop talking!
Just stop talking and let me think!
Dad, do something.
I got it.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm being cute and spontaneous?
Don't do it.
I wasn't going to.
Yep, this is a good dinner.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Malcolm.
Yeah?
Can I see you for a minute, please?
Ooh.
Teacher's favorite.
Teacher's pet.
''Dear Penthouse '' ''Yesterday I pushed my friend Stevie down some stairs.
'' Point taken What?
Malcolm, I'm a little concerned.
You're doing very well in your studies, but I still sense an emotional distance between us.
And I hate it.
I'd really like us to try to connect on a deeper level.
Whoa.
She is coming on to me.
I thought you were dating the janitor.
Who told you that?
God.
One drink and Never mind.
What I am trying to say is, I know your parents.
I know you have a colorful home life.
So,just remember if you ever need anything at all-- a sympathetic ear, a shoulder to cry on-- I want you to come to me.
Yeah.
That's what I need-- another mom.
Okay.
Great.
Thanks a lot.
Well, I got to go do thething.
And then I drew a robot, Francis.
But my crayon broke.
And then I had a Popsicle.
I mean, I had 1 2 Popsicles.
You like Popsicles, Francis?
Shut up, Dewey.
Stop bugging Francis.
I'm so glad you're home.
You don't know what it's like dealing with these little kids all day.
It's the coolest thing.
It's the first time Francis is home from military school.
Mom and Dad are going off to some wedding and Francis is in charge of us for the whole weekend.
I can't believe how much I missed him.
Hey.
Hmph.
He's so great.
Boys!
The number for the hotel is on the counter.
I left money for pizza, but I want a receipt and exact change.
Yep, that underwear is going to wrinkle.
It's kind of nice having Francis back in the house, don't you think?
- What?
- Nothing.
You're just cute when you think you're being subtle.
Really?
Of course it's nice having Francis home.
Well, it's been a few months now.
Maybe it's time to, you know, think about it.
I don't know.
Maybe.
We'll see how he does this weekend.
God, I hate this hairdo.
I don't even know why I bother trying to impress your family anymore.
They've always hated me.
Well, you are the one who stole their little Hally away from them.
Better get moving.
And then it got away.
But I found another one, but it died.
And then I said leave him alone, you butt-munch.
Let me go.
Make me.
Guys, quit it.
Listen for a second.
I just heard Mom and Dad.
They're thinking about letting Francis come home.
You serious?
Yeah.
They want to see how he does with us this weekend.
- Okay?
So we can't screw up.
- Cool.
- Let's go tell him.
- No.
You know how Francis gets when people tell him what to do.
I am warning you.
If you get your nose pierced, you are going to military school.
And I mean it.
Really.
Do you hear me?
Hey, Mom.
What's for dinner?
Right.
What are we going to do?
We're going to be good, that's what.
How do we be good?
I don't know.
Honestly, it's never come up before.
Look, we're just not going to do anything.
That way, we can't get in any trouble.
Honey.
We're late.
We better hit the road.
Fine.
I'll shave my legs in the car.
Okay.
I've marked the liquor bottles, and we can taste when they're watered down.
I've locked out the smut channel, counted your father's cigars.
I've checked the odometer on the car and the balance on the credit cards.
We love you, have a good time.
And just remember, Dewey will tell us everything you did while we're gone.
Uh, what your mother said, boys.
Minus one.
Don't even think about it.
Think about what?
She's bluffing.
Okay, I am going to show you guys the coolest thing you have ever seen.
Get me some lighter fluid, a waffle iron and one of Dewey's stuffed animals.
The furrier, the better.
Actually, we're kind of tired.
Tired?
Yeah.
Tired.
I'm not tired.
Okay, yeah, I'm tired.
Let's just go watch TV.
Whatever.
This plan better work.
The only thing worse than no TV is golf on TV.
Oh, come on, guys.
Let's go outside.
Let's go do something.
No.
They're only on the sixth hole.
They're only on the sixth hole.
Hello.
Francis, bud, I heard you were in town.
You da man, Francis!
Hey, guys, what's going on?
Same old, same old, man.
Oh, Circus says hi.
Dude, you're not going to believe it.
I finally moved out.
I'm living in the basement now.
Total freedom, dude.
You da man, Francis!
Mom, you're supposed to knock.
Dude, we're coming over.
Okay.
Hey, Richie and the guys are coming over.
Maybe they shouldn't.
You know, Mom and Dad are gone.
Okay, got it.
Richie, listen to me.
I'm watching my brothers, so we got to hang here.
And no parties okay?
I'm serious.
It's got to be just the three of you.
Huh.
You wouldn't think only three guys could do so much damage.
Call us next time you're in town.
You da man, Francis!
Skyrockets in flight Afternoon delight Are you trying to seduce me?
I can't believe we're going to this wedding.
What a waste of time.
Oh, come on, I promise it'll be fun.
Hal, I'm not Dewey.
Sorry.
But still, we're alone, we're away from the kids.
Right now, we're just two unencumbered consenting adults.
I say we enjoy it.
Yeah, you're right.
It will be nice to have some time for just the two of us.
And I'm going to love not having to yell at somebody every 20 seconds.
Either speed up or get off the road,jackass!
Absolutely deserved it.
: I hate those guys.
Did you see Circus break that cinder block with his head?
That's a good lesson for you guys.
It didn't break the first six times.
But did he quit trying?
No, sir.
Francis, we have to clean this up.
Yeah.
No.
I mean now.
If Mom and Dad see this they'll freak.
So what else is new?
They always freak.
I'm used to it.
This is different.
We have to clean up.
What's with you guys?
I'm in charge here.
I'm the only one who'll get in trouble.
Relax.
- But we want you to come home.
- What?
I heard Mom and Dad talking.
This weekend is like a test for you, or a trap.
If you do good, they may let you come home.
And if you don't, they're gonna toss your butt back into military school.
Okay, look Francis, it sucks around here without you.
Can't you just try for our sake?
Look, guys, I appreciate your sentiment.
But they're not going to decide my whole future based on how I behave over one weekend without even telling me about it.
It's too arbitrary.
It's unreasonable.
It's Mom.
Okay, let's clean up.
I'm not done And I won't be Till my head falls off It's perfect.
The house has never been this clean.
Uh-oh.
What?
It's too clean.
You're right.
They'll never buy it.
I'm not done And I won't be Till my head falls off Though that may not be a long way off I won't be done until my head Falls off Ah.
Looks like we're the only ones who gave them pot holders.
- Hi.
- Hi.
It's great to see you.
You, too.
You look terrific.
How long do you think it's been?
I don't know.
Will you excuse me?
Well, that was worth driving 600 miles for.
Who was that guy?
It's the groom, Hal.
I wish people would wear name tags at these things.
Oh, perfect.
Nice touch with the bread crumbs, Dewey.
Huh?
I clipped my toenails on the coffee table.
Attaboy.
She will never know a thing.
Wait.
Ta-da!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Malcolm!
Malcolm, are you okay?
I think so.
Ow.
!
!
!
Hold still.
Come here and let me see it.
Let me see it.
How does it look?
Not too bad.
Put his face back on!
Oh, man, what's that white stuff?
- Is that bone?
- What?
!
Get ice and some paper towels.
We have to put pressure on it.
- Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
- I'm sorry.
I have to put pressure on it.
Reese, give me the ice!
We don't have any.
We've got this.
Fine.
Give me some antiseptic.
Don't answer that.
Dewey: Hello.
Lois: Hi, Dewey.
Hi, Mom.
We're just calling to check in.
Let me speak with Francis.
He's in the bathroom.
Well, let me talk to Malcolm.
He's in the bathroom.
They're both in the bathroom?
What are they doing in there?
I have to go to the bathroom.
We have to get you stitches.
Let's go to the hospital.
No!
You can't.
Mom and Dad will find out.
Malcolm, this is a head injury.
You could have a concussion.
Concussion?
I think he's making too much of this.
I'm not as figgled as he hoogers.
No!
I don't care.
I'm not going to the hospital.
Do you hear me?
There is no way that I Get the car!
I can't see anything.
You want to get blood all over the car?
Wait!
We can't take the car.
They'll know.
Mom checked the odometer, remember?
I'm on top of it.
Whee!
Hi, school!
Oh, Malcolm, you should see this!
Francis is kicking ass!
I hate this '80s crap.
One good thing about a head injury: there's a good chance I won't remember any of this.
Oh, great.
A one-way street.
How does that work if I'm going backwards?
And on this joyous day, as we celebrate the occasion of two souls joining into one Do you think this is going to be one of those long services?
What's wrong?
Did you know that your family has given me a nickname?
Really?
That's nice.
What is it?
Lois Common Denominator.
Hey, come on.
It's just that they've never seen anyone like you.
I mean, you're, you're honest, and, uh unpretentious.
Direct.
They're baffled by that.
I'm the only one that gets you, Lois, and, frankly, I I like that.
Kind of makes you my secret treasure.
Oh, Hal.
Between the Lord and us, his servants, two people brought together in love  Oh, for God's sake.
You kids again?
And a head injury.
You boys like to keep it interesting, don't you?
We kind of have a history here.
I was in the right place But it must have been the wrong time Thought I said the right thing But it must have been the wrong line I was in the right world But it seemed like it was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong Look, Doc, uh, about the bill Oh, don't worry.
We'll send it to your parents.
Yeah, well we were kind of thinking we'd pay for it now.
Okeydokey, but it's probably going to be about $400.
- What?
!
- $400?
Don't you have a frequent customer discount like at the car wash?
Or maybe we could work it off.
We could empty bedpans, or wash cadavers.
It's probably not nearly as cool as it sounds.
Sorry.
Well, we're screwed.
Come on, there's got to be something we can do, someone we can call.
There's no one, Malcolm.
Actually, there might be, but I'm not sure if it's worth it.
: Oh, Malcolm!
Are you all right?
Sorry it took me so long.
I was having a chardonnay when you called, and I had to take a cab.
Oh, God, I knew we made a deeper connection.
I just knew it.
Now it's going to be hard to turn against your parents, but in time you'll see No!
You don't understand.
My parents didn't do this.
It was just an accident, and they can't find out about it.
What?
It's kind of complicated.
See, my parents are away at a wedding, and my brother is home from military school to take care of us.
I don't think people should be punished just 'cause their dad uses cheap nails.
We need $400, lady.
Will you let me talk?
!
We need the money for the doctor bill, because if my parents find out that I got hurt then they'll send Francis away, and we'll never see him again, and, you know, we love him.
Malcolm, I can't do that.
But you said if I ever needed anything Yes, I was talking about emotional stuff.
I Do you have any idea what a teacher earns?
I have $62 in my checking account.
They take credit cards.
I'm sorry.
I'm I'm, I'm just sorry.
We can break her.
Guilt.
Go for guilt.
I got it.
That's okay.
Thanks, anyway.
Well, squirt, looks like I'm going to be going back to military school and I'm not going to see you for a really, really long time.
But I need you to be brave.
Can you do that for me, squirt?
Stop, Francis!
I wish I could, kiddo, but I can't.
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm not doing this, Dewey.
It's just the way life is sometimes.
Please stop crying.
- It hurts!
- I know it does.
It hurts me too.
Wait!
I'll, I'll do it.
I guess Jamaica isn't going anywhere.
Where is my credit card?
- It fell out of your wallet.
- How did that happen?
Let's go.
Processing is right over here.
Right near the vending machines.
Do you have any change?
Thank you.
Way to take one for the team, buddy.
When we get home you can eat ice cream until you puke.
: Yay.
-  - Hey!
Ocupado.
!
Huh.
Well I don't see any holes or crappy attempts to plaster them up.
But I'm sure there's something.
There's always something.
What are you hiding underneath that hat?
Nothing.
I was just wearing You boys.
That's it?
.
!
So, you guys think Francis did a good job taking care of us, then?
- Oh, a great job.
- Absolutely.
You know, Francis, we were having our doubts about that school, but it's really matured you.
In fact, I think it's the best decision we ever made.
Mom: 62,437 Kids: zero.
So, we get to see Francis again in a month or two.
I know.
It sucks, but we gave it a shot.
And school's easier now because Caroline won't even make eye contact with me anymore.
So it wasn't a complete waste, and Mom always says it's not a wasted experience if you learn something from it.
And I definitely think I did.
Okay!
Ready!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
We're gathered here today to say good-bye toJumpy Number Eight.
Nine.
Nine.
He was a good Nine?
Are you sure, nine?
Anyway, he was a very good frog.
And he led a very full life.
I remember when I stuck him in Mom's sun visor and she almost hit that lady in the crosswalk.
It was hysterical.
Farewell,Jumpy Number Nine.
We know you're going to a better place.
Bye,Jumpy.
Dad   May he rest in pieces.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair Kenarban winds up bases loaded series on the line.
Would you just throw the ball?
Ow!
Want me to kiss it?
Oh, man.
Kevin.
I hate this guy.
He's only been here for two weeks and he's already the most obnoxious kid in the school.
Little help.
Lose your ball-ey, baby?
Can I have my ball back, Kevin?
''Can I have my ball back, Kevin?
'' Come on, Kevin.
''Come on, Kevin.
'' De gustibus non est disputandum.
De kub You stink!
Your new name is Stinky.
Whatever.
Just give me my ball back.
You want it?
Go get it, Stinky.
Men, most of you are at an age where your bodies have undergone significant changes.
While the benefits of increased muscle mass and a more authoritative speaking register are plain these changes can produce certain negative desires.
Now, we used to handle it with cold showers and regularly scheduled beatings but sadly, times have changed and I am forced to rely on a less effective option: education.
Pretty, isn't she?
Perhaps her name is Mary or Wendy or Becky Lou.
It doesn't matter because her real name is disease.
Not so pretty anymore, is she, men?
Chancres lesions furuncles Such is the price of weakness.
I can't believe they're swallowing this.

Spangler has ruined everything in our lives.
Now he has to ruin sex?
Now, remember every one of these diseases can easily be transmitted to you.
Excuse me, sir?
Isn't that slide upside down?
No, son.
No, it isn't.
Dewey: Ow!
I'll get the ice pack.
Dewey, we told you to stop climbing that tree.
It's too big.
I couldn't help it.
I know, sweetheart.
That's it.
I've had it.
That sucker's coming down.
You're going to cut down the tree?
Darn right.
I'm sick and tired of raking leaves and hosing bird poop off our car.
And seeing that weird face in the bark that follows you wherever you go.
And now it's going after the children?
No, Lois, it has to be stopped.
Can I help kill it?
Sure, sweetheart.
We'll take turns.
All right, frozen pizza.
The only thing Rowena can't ruin.
Hey, no cuts.
''Hey, no cuts.
'' Two slices, please.
Is there any more pizza?
No.
All out.
It's American Goulash for you.
What is that?
I don't know.
All I can identify are little pieces of carrot and I don't know, I think they're Skittles.
Hey, look at the goulash boy.
Get away from me, Kevin.
Ooh, ''get away from me, Kevin.
'' He's so sad that he doesn't have pizza and I do.
I said get away.
Chill man.
I got your back.
What are you looking at, Kenar-butt?
Light some shadows.
Kevin, I'm warning you.
Get out of my face.
Oh, Malcolm doesn't like me eating close to his face with pizza I have and he doesn't.
Pizza, pizza, pizza.
: Pizza : Pizza Pizza You want pizza?
I'll give you pizza.
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Wow, watching hockey's really paid off.
I can't believe how good I'm doing.
What do you mean he's only seven?
What's not to understand?
He just turned seven.
I guess you were too busy beating people to notice.
He can't be seven.
He's bigger than I am.
He's in second grade.
Look at all this blood.
That's not blood.
It's pizza sauce.
Well, that's blood, but Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
I want my Teletubby!
A doll?
You can't play with dolls if you're seven.
Why are you seven?
You beat up a seven-year-old?
I didn't know.
Malcolm, I don't blame you.
I put this squarely where it belongs.
On me.
Oh, man, this is the most horrible thing I've ever done.
Kevin, I'm sorry.
I think you've done quite enough.
This is the worst birthday ever!
''Inappropriate vicious.
'' Oh, wait-- ''Thug.
'' Dude, I have never gotten ''thug'' before.
That's like the Oscar.
Susie Gunther ate my crayons.
Can you beat her up tomorrow?
Leave me alone.
You know what my favorite part is?
It's when you pound on someone and then a day later you still feel the pain in your knuckles.
Oh, I love that.
Shut up, Reese.
Hey, hey, pace yourself, killer.
Whoa.
Whoo-hoo!
Dad.
You cut down the tree and we missed it?
Oh, baby, you missed it, all right.
I was about two-thirds of the way through her then crack!
Kaboom!
My chain saw goes flying.
All the car alarms go off.
About 1 00 squirrels came boiling out of the branches.
Then a pack of dogs came out of nowhere and chased them all over.
Man, I've never seen anything like it.
Man Oh, don't worry, son.
You'll get to share in the best part.
Cleaning up.
I think you'll enjoy my sexual awareness lecture next week.
It's been called riveting.
I'm sure it is, sir.
It sure worked wonders for me, sir.
The only woman I can think of without vomiting is my own mother.
As it should be, son, as it should be.
He's giving that same lecture to the underclassmen.
I can't let that happen.
I'm stealing his slides.
And to you that's a good idea?
Absolutely.
I know it's hard core, Stanley but I'm not doing this for me.
I'm doing it for them.
After all, they are the future.
Francis, I don't know why you assume we'll be able to just walk into Spangler's office and find the sex slides.
Oh, man, I wish all my break-ins were this easy.
Okay, I got 'em.
Let's get out of here.
Wait a second.
Oh, my God, this is a gold mine.
Spangler drinking Spangler kissing Spangler in a Speedo?
Spangler out of a Speedo.
All right, that's enough.
Let's leave, huh?
Wait a second.
I have an idea.
I'm going to make Spangler's sexual awareness lecture just a little more interesting.
You do realize what he'll do to you if you humiliate him like this, right?
And yet, I'm doing it anyway.
Weird, huh?
Why are the eggs so little?
They're robin's eggs from the tree your father cut down.
Paul Bunyan.
That's nature for you.
There's got to be a lesson in there somewhere.
It is nice having this extra light in the room.
Wait till I bring in the wood chipper.
Then you're really going to see something.
I can't take this anymore.
When are you going to punish me?
For what?
For beating up a seven-year-old.
Oh, my God, that's right.
You must've just felt ridiculous when you found out how old that kid was.
I can only imagine the look on your face.
I'll get it.
Oh, this is nice.
We should start every day with a good laugh.
It's not funny.
It's awful.
I did something horrible.
Don't you even care?
Well, it's nothing to be proud of, son but you told us the whole story and he didn't give you much choice.
It was an honest beating mistake.
Besides, it sends a good message to our enemies.
What are you talking about?
What enemies?
Oh, they're out there.
And once they know we're capable of this they'll know we're capable of anything.
Okay, so it's not just me, right?
There's something seriously wrong with this family.
Lois: It's none of your business what we do on our property.
Ed: That tree was older than your house.
You had no right to cut it down.
We're a neighborhood.
And removing trees is a neighborhood decision.
Oh, you people.
For 1 5 years, you mowed your lawns at night so you don't have to talk to us.
Now, all of a sudden we're a neighborhood?
What's going on here?
You've caused a blight by cutting down that tree.
How is cutting down a tree a blight?
Because now we can see your house.
Lois: Well, let me tell you something, Ed.
As far as I'm concerned you and the neighbors can all just  That goes double for me.
I want you all off our property now or      No wonder I'm a thug.
How can they act like this?
Then I found out he was only seven.
I didn't know what to do.
I felt like I had to talk to someone.
I hope I'm doing this right.
See, my family-- we're not like regular churchgoers but I know places like this are supposed to help you feel better and that's really what I need.
I did something terrible, and now I just feel like there's something wrong with me.
I mean, really wrong, deep inside.
I can't shake it.
What do I do?
Look to the church.
Look to God.
Look within.
But first ask forgiveness.
You must atone.
You must cleanse your spirit.

I feel much better.
Bye.
Hey, boys.
Where's your brother?
I don't know.
He said something about being evil and he took off.
Ah.
Uh, stay back.
Wow!
That was the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Really?
All it does is instantly vaporize anything that goes into it.
Dewey!
What was?
!
Actually, that was pretty cool.
What else you got?
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Well, we've obviously run out of ideas.
Yolanda, this is a love that cannot be.
Eraserhead: Stop!
Can't you put some life in it?
It's 1 969!
The slide rule is about to be replaced by the pocket calculator!
You have to feel the panic in the air.
I can't stop thinking about what I did to Kevin.
I feel like crap, and no one understands.
Even you.
You're supposed to be my friend and you don't even care.
And yet you keep talking.
Maybe if I did something good that would cancel it out, right?
Or if I'm only doing it to feel better is that selfish and doesn't count as much?
Stevie?
Okay.
So, I just have to think of a really giant good deed.
That way, I know I'll be in the plus column.
I bet I can think of something great.
I just have to put some thought into it.
There!
That's perfect.
I'll run the marathon and get people to pledge money for every mile that I go.
I hate running, so it'll be hard and I'll have to train for it, so it'll take dedication and it'll be helping cure diseases which no one likes.
And then I can get on with my life.
No!
No!
No!
I can't work like this!
I'll be at my cubby.
This'll work.
It has to.
There we go.
Looks great, Dad.
Yeah?
I don't know.
Now that it's in there it sort of makes me miss the old tree.
This one's a little droopy and the branches are a little spindly and there's no face.
Well, there's that little one but it's not the kindly little spooky face Oh, my God!
What have I done?
Reese get my chain saw.
I hear your son likes to beat up seven-year-olds.
I wouldn't say he likes it.
He's good at it, apparently.
Look in my family we don't go for that.
Probably not a good idea to poke me.
''Probably not a good idea to poke me.
''  I'm sorry I beat him up but how was I supposed to know he was 1 5?
He was huge.
You should have seen the grip he had on my throat.
Caroline: Okay, peoples I need all the pledge sheets before we can begin.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Caroline?
Malcolm, I am so glad you decided to do this.
Now, were you able to get any pledges?
Here.
Wow.
I don't suppose there's a beer guy around here.
This is a charity race at an elementary school.
Oh.
So, I have to go to a stand, or something, huh?
My God.
Are these real?
Well, I assume so.
Why?
Well, look at all of them.
He has more pledges here than everyone else put together.
If he runs the distance he is going to raise over $8,000.
Man Over P.A.: Runners, take your marks.
Get set.
Ow.
Spangler: Perhaps her name is Mary or Wendy, or Becky Lou.
It doesn't matter because her real name is disease.
Isn't so pretty anymore, is she, boys?
Chancres lesions furuncles-- Such is the pri Why, these aren't the proper slides.
Some hooligan has switched them.
This is obviously some ingenious scheme to humiliate me.
I find myself so overcome with embarrassment I can't stop clicking.
Although there's probably one in here of a cadet who thinks he's all alone, and Well technical difficulties.
We will resume the lecture with the proper slides at 0800 tomorrow.
Gentlemen.
Remember, son a good soldier always checks the chamber.
Okay, this is going to sting.
What is with you?
Nothing.
Usually you scream like a stuck pig when I put this stuff on.
You've been such a zombie lately.
It feels worse on the inside than it does on my knee.
What are you talking about?
Mom, I can't stop feeling bad about what I did to Kevin.
I feel like I have a monster inside of me.
Oh, for crying out loud, Malcolm that's no monster.
That's your conscience.
You should be thankful God gave you one.
Yeah.
It feels great.
I'm serious.
It's a gift.
And you know what most people do with theirs?
They keep them in the closet and bring them out only when they think he's coming to visit.
You're not like that.
Good for you.
But I can't stop thinking about it.
Ow!
Were you thinking about it just then?
No!
See?
I promise you will feel bad about Kevin only as long as you're supposed to.
Now, go to bed.
You're a nice boy, Malcolm and I'll kick the conniption out of anybody who says you aren't including that little voice in your head.
Okay.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, sweetie.
Night, Dad.
Good night, son.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Pass the chips, please.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Wow, that was a really great move.
My head just went flying.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I told you boys these games are too violent.
Here, watch something wholesome.
Man: ?
The sun is a mass of incandescent gas ?
A gigantic nuclear furnace Where hydrogen is built Give me more chips!
Get your own, doofus!
Shut up!
I'm watching!
You shut up!
I want more chips!
Here!
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Lois: $90 for a toy?
It's not a toy.
It's a robotics kit.
You build a little mechanical rover.
It teaches you about electronics and engineering.
Does it teach you to pick up your socks?
That I'm interested in.
Hal: Besides, son robots are evil.
What?
!
Westworld, Terminator the creepy maid from TheJetsons How much scientific proof do you need?
Mom!
Malcolm, no!
If you want this thing so badly pay for it with your own money.
You're starting to baby-sit next week.
Just save up.
What will they pay me?
I'll tell you what they'll pay you.
What all jobs pay-- less than you're worth and just enough to keep you crawling back for more.
Now go on.
It's bedtime.
That's the way discussions go down in this family.
I tell them my needs and they say no.
Then Dad reveals another cartoon character he's afraid of.
Hey, how much time do you think we have?
Not long enough for that look.
You butt-wipe, that's my toothbrush.
So use mine.
You can't just take someone's toothbrush.
Give me that.
Fine.
Oops.
Hal that is the third bug I've seen today.
You have got to call the exterminator!
What, and miss out on watching you hunt?
You're like a sexy, bug-killing panther.
Reese: Malcolm, stop!
Lois: That's it!
Bedtime was 20 minutes ago.
Go to bed!
Go to bed!
Bed!
Hal, bring the spray!
I haven't rinsed yet.
Only boys who behave themselves get to rinse.
Honestly, every night we go through this!
Mom, can I have a story?
Once upon a time there was a little boy who made his mother so crazy she decided to sell him to the circus.
An evil circus?
No, a nice one with monkeys.
Thank you.
Hal: Ah, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I think I see where they're coming from.
Ah, you cannot hide.
Aw Aw!
Okay, come on, boys.
We're all camping out in the den tonight.
Here we go.
Hey, Francis, aren't you going to open up your mom's care package?
Give me a minute.
I'm still savoring this.
I swiped Commandant Spangler's master key.
It opens every door in the academy, Stanley.
Every door.
I think it's cookies.
Who cares?
I'm about to expose every secret sin this place conceals to the harsh light of day.
So, can I open it?
Yeah.
What'd my mom send me?
Bug-infested cookies.
As usual, a mixed message.
And this is the living room.
This is the biggest, nicest house I've ever seen!
Wow!
Pomocanthus imperator.
We call him Barney.
Malcolm?
We saved you some dinner.
Dinner?
Me?
Saved?
Dinner?
We weren't sure which you liked better turkey or roast beef, so we fixed you a platter.
Platter?
!
Okay, kids, what time is it?
- Bedtime!
- Bedtime!
Boy: I'll race you!
They're going to bed?
So you're just paying me to hang out here for three hours?
Well, maybe three and a half.
We'll round up to four, of course.
Come on, there's got to be a catch!
Oh, and Malcolm, you can't watch television unless you turn on the satellite first.
Otherwise, all you'll get is pornography.
It's weird I think I'm having a spasm.
The muscles in my face keep pulling on my mouth.
Oh, I think I'm happy!
I just don't understand how it got so bad so fast.
Well, it's been pretty hot this year.
That's part of it, but, uh mostly it's that giant pile of candy wrappers and half-eaten cereal boxes you have in your crawl space.
It's like there's some kind of creepy hobo living down there.
Whoa there really is a lost bomb shelter.
Wow, this is almost as exciting as that room full of folding chairs.
Let's get out of here.
Aw, come on, Francis.
Don't you want to explore?
We might find the abandoned furnace room or the old Civil War amputorium.
I didn't want to say this before but you've confirmed it-- Marlin Academy is the most boring place on earth.
We're not going to find anything interesting.
I take that back.
Look, the circus!
The circus is at our house!
Say good-bye for a few days, boys.
We're moving out.
This is humiliating.
Why can't we just stay at a nice hotel?
Because we're giving all our money to the exterminators so they can stay in nice hotels.
Craig thank you so much for lending us your trailer.
Oh, I'm just glad someone's finally getting some use out of it.
I bought it 1 5 years ago to take on my honeymoon.
You were married?
No, I live on hope.
Well thanks again.
You're welcome.
Bye.
Good-bye.
Aw, this is cozy!
It's 1 50 degrees in here!
My butt is sweating.
Ah, it just needs to air out a little.
The trailer!
Come on, let's make the best of this.
I'm going to go baby-sit.
It's still early.
They don't mind.
They paying you okay?
Yeah.
It's okay.
I can't believe how much these people are paying me!
I did the math I'm actually making more an hour than Mom does.
I got to stop doing this.
It's creepy, right?
''Lester.
'' Looks like he was the janitor.
How long you think he's been down here?
I'd say May of'85.
You can tell that by tasting?
No, the date on the newspaper.
Then why did you lick him?
How often do you get to taste a mummy?
We should tell someone about him.
Uh, no, you can't do that.
Commandant will know you took the key and he'll punish you and then he'll punish me and I'm going to have to punish you.
Yeah, but don't you think that's kind of sad?
I mean, Lester's family will never know what happened to him.
They probably still set a place for him on holidays.
Yeah, well,judging by the empty scotch bottles and German dungeon porn, I don't think so.
Damn.
Beta.
And you made fun of me when I bought this mesh underwear.
Who looks like an idiot now?
I stand corrected.
Close the door.
Were you raised in a barn?
But it's cooler outside.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Will you please make up your mind?
There's no need for that kind of tone.
It wasn't a tone.
There it is again.
Look, Hal, it's hot.
We're all cranky.
Will you please just drop it?
Fine.
I think you should apologize.
I didn't hear you apologize to me when you used up all the liquid in the chemical toilet.
Well, we have your taco casserole to thank for that, don't we?
Boys, will you step outside for second?
Your father and I need a little privacy.
Lois: Look, I didn't want to say anything in front of the boys but you are behaving like a giant ass!
Hal: Oh, really?
Well, as long as we're on the subject of giant asses I'm ready to go.
Hey, you want to see something?
That's okay; I don't want to break it.
Ah, don't be silly.
Come, take a look.
Wow.
That's a spiral galaxy.
These people are amazing.
They're rich, they're smart, they're polite What are they going to do next, give me a million dollars?
Malcolm, do you want a million dollars?
What?
!
I said, do you want a sandwich to take home?
Oh.
Close enough.
I only asked out your sister because you said you weren't interested!
And I was thinking of you the whole time!
Aw, don't give me that!
I saw the charm bracelet!
This isn't even mine!
What, are you insane?
You're throwing out stuff that's not even mine!
What are you looking at?
Hey, this is a private conversation, buster!
Hal: Huh?
Oh, yeah, like you've never seen this before!
My mistake.
I'm on the next street over.
You were right about Lester.
I checked him out-- no wife, no kids.
Poor guy didn't have a friend in the world.
Here you go, Lester buddy.
Did you tell anyone about this place?
No.
Huh.
Must've been me, then.
All right, that's enough!
Party's over!
Don't you guys have any respect for the dead?
You took his wallet.
Lester would've wanted me to have his I.D.
But that's not the point.
This man was not just an alcoholic pervert janitor.
He was one of us!
He hated the Commandant as much as we do.
He was filled with impudent rage, like we are.
This man was a hero and heroes do not rot alone in basements.
They're immortalized in song.
They are sent off to Valhalla in flaming ships!
They are not put in beer hats or used as photo props or given fake moustaches.
Oh, man Oh That wasn't fake.
My bad.
What do we do now?
Go for the spare.
Francis, I'm sorry I'm calling you so late.
I had to talk to someone.
Hey, no problem.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Do you ever feel like you don't really belong in a family?
Dude, I'm in military school.
I think that question's been answered.
Right.
This is good.
At least someone else in the family is normal.
Hey, listen, while I got you you're in school with all those science brains.
How would you reattach a head to a dead body?
Keep it down!
Huh?
Don't talk to her like that.
Would you go sit in the corner?
There are no corners!
You ready to make up?
No.
Me, neither.
Oh, hello, son.
I barely see you anymore.
That baby-sitting has turned into a full-time job.
Well, sometimes I just go over there to hang out and watch TV live in a house Dad, does this seem okay to you?
Gosh, no.
Your mother and I have never fought for this long before.
It's been days, and we still haven't made up.
I don't even know what the problem is.
Something's missing.
Boy look at that sky, Malcolm.
Just think somewhere out there in all those stars and planets there might be at this very moment a space dad who just got kicked out of his space trailer who is looking down at us.
Or would it be up at us?
Or maybe sideways?
Trust me, Dad.
They're all looking down on us.
The matinee gets out at 4:00 so we should be back before dinner.
Okay.
What do you want me to feed the kids for lunch?
Whatever you want.
We trust you.
They trust me.
People like this trust me.
I obviously have to say something nice back to them.
This is why my family sucks.
I have no training in this.
This job me like.
We're thrilled to have found you, Malcolm.
The kids love you.
You're great to have around.
You've really become one of the family.
I may not have been switched at birth but I should have been.
I love these people.
Okay, come on.
Wait a minute.
Sorry.
Well let's see what our little friend did today.
Oh, hi.
Don't worry.
I'd never hurt Barney.
He's part of the family.
Just like I'm part of the family, right?
And since a big part of this family is being such a huge phony and launching secret investigations against each other I thought I'd join in.
Personal computers are great.
You can file tax returns, medical records embarrassing private E-mail A little security tip, though.
Never use your birthdate as your password.
And hiding things in a fake salt can?
That's just silly.
I don't know who Melissa is but she sure wears a lot of lipstick.
Anyway, I think I hear you guys pulling up in the driveway so let's just leave it at this: I quit.
Bye.
Who's Melissa?
Hi, son.
Didn't hear you drive up.
I decided to walk.
So, how's the job going?
They were jerks, so I quit.
Well, that's pretty much what work is.
Welcome to the club.
Dad?
Hmm?
I'm really sorry.
What?
About quitting?
Nah no big deal, especially for you.
Malcolm, you should set your sights as high as you can.
If anyone in this family has a shot at greatness it's you.
Just, uh do me a favor, huh?
Look after your brothers?
Okay, wait, wait.
You mean everything you just said, right?
Why would I say something I didn't mean?
See?
That's what I'm talking about.
This family may be rude, loud and gross and have no shame whatsoever Anyway, with them you know where you stand and when I have a problem, they're always there.
Oh, my Lord.
-  - Sex!
Things didn't work out so bad.
I made enough money to get my robotics kit.
Or maybe I should do something nice for my family.
Take them to dinner treat them to a movie Naw, then I couldn't do this.
Lois: If you don't change your underwear this is exactly what happens.
Like the ancient civilizations before us we send off this noble man with the riches he had in life so he may enjoy them in the afterlife.
Farewell, noble Lester.
It's burning really fast.
How much gas did you use?
Half a can.
Where'd you put the can?
Oh Look.
It's heading toward the boathouse.
What do you think?
Run?
Yeah.
I'd run.
I figured it out.
Hal, you okay?
Whenever we'd fight, you'd yell, then I'd yell but then we would you know?
Well, you see, we haven't had a chance to because we're in that trailer with kids Oh, my God, Hal, you're right.
What are we going to do?
We've got the kids I've got it all figured out.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la Means ''I love you'' Oh, baby, please La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la Means ''I love you''

Photographer: Squeeze in.
Little closer together.
Chins up like baby birds.
- Boys: Move.
- Shut up.
Malcolm: Stop touching me.
I'm not touching you.
I was clipping on my tie.
While touching me.
Stop it!
Why do we have to do this?
We don't have a single picture of us all together.
That's ridiculous.
We're a family.
We should have a family portrait.
Well, Francis isn't here.
I'm not going to cough up $200 bucks to fly him in for one silly picture.
Where's Dewey?
Dewey, get out of there.
That's not your family.
You sure you want autumn leaves as a backdrop?
Yes.
You didn't even look at happy windmills.
It's more colorful.
Space shuttle.
Photographer: Next.
I have a coupon for one eight-by-ten and two wallet-size for $9.99 and that's what I want.
Not the Golden Moments collection.
I don't want the Family and Friends collection.
I don't want the Lifetime of Love.
One eight-by-ten and two wallet-size for $9.99.
Fine.
We have an installment plan if that would help.
I brought a picture of Francis.
He's going to be in the portrait.
Cool.
I'll hold it.
No, I'm going to hold it.
- Let go.
- Come on.
Dewey, pants on, mister.
I'm sorry.
- Coupon's expired.
- What?
It's expired.
What you want will run you $39.50.
Ooh, lonely beach.
Hal.
For another $5.00 you can have the Instant Memory set.
That comes with double exposure silhouettes.
Look, could you please do what I'm asking you to - I'm older!
- It was my idea!
That is it!
Get up!
Get back!
Come here!
Go there!
Okay.
We are going to take this picture and it's going to be good.
And that means no faces no tongues, no crossed eyes no bunny ears.
We are going to smile.
We are going to look good.
It is going to cost us $9.99.
And all of this is going to happen by the time I count to three.
-  - One, two, three.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Hello.
Hello.
Listen, pervert, this is the third time you've called and I have just about had it with Is Malcolm there?
Oh, hi, Stevie.
Sorry.
Uh, Malcolm, phone.
Hey, Stevie.
You're coming tonight?
Yeah.
And sleeping over?
It's a sleepover.
That's what you do.
I'm just excited.
Never had one.
We can read comics and build models.
Stevie, I never thought I'd say this but slow down.
Ha ha.
Forty-one forty-two forty-three Okay, stop.
I can't do any more.
You think later on you can manage to stand on my stomach while I do sit-ups?
Oh,just give me a minute, okay?
Finley, what are you doing in the cupboard?
Poquito cabeza.
Get out of there, man.
I can't.
I've been marked by the brothers of the apocalypse.
Poquito cabeza.
Brothers of the apocalypse?
It's ridiculous.
It's five seniors with limited imaginations.
Yeah.
That's easy for you to say.
You've got Stanley protecting you.
And you're not holding poquito cabeza.
Stop saying poquito cabeza.
I can't.
And I'm not coming out.
Oh, could you turn in my math homework?
These guys are so lame.
Amateurs.
Poor Finley.
He's good at math, right?
: Finley, boom-ba-yay.
Finley, boom-ba-yay, Finley, boom-ba-yay Oh, no!
Please!

Finley, boom-ba-yay Please, help me!
Help me!
No!
Hey, Mom, I'm going to Stevie's.
You be nice to that boy.
He can't walk.
If he's got to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, you get up and help him.
Yes!
There's a Chucky movie on tonight.
Not in this house.
You know how your father feels about evil puppet movies.
Please, Mom.
It's not a school night.
I can stay up.
Think you're old enough?
I totally am.
Well, if you really think so.
Aw, Mom, no fair.
What's the matter?
Afraid you can't beat your mommy?
She's just a person.
She's just a person.
Oh, no.
He's finally going to win.
What's he playing for tonight?
Bedtime and a Chucky movie.
Stop screwing around and pin him.
Oh, you'll have to forgive the mess, Malcolm.
Mmm, when our Stevie enters a room it's like a typhoon hit.
Well, uh, we'll leave you alone.
Check it out, Stevie.
The T-Rex is three feet tall with a movable jaw.
Red paint for blood.
This is so cool.
I heard screaming.
Yeah.
I said, ''This is so cool.
'' Is that a switchblade?
It's an X-Acto knife to cut the pieces apart.
I use it all the time.
We'll lock this up with the scissors.
How about a puzzle?
Stevie, it's been a long time since you did the Arc de Triomphe.
We'll just give that back when you go home.
Puzzles are fun.
You think we can order some pizza?
Mom's making pizza.
Cheeseless sauceless pizza.
That's just bread.
Pizza bread.
Wise poquito cabeza.
Who shall your next victim be?
I am so sick of these guys.
What's that?
You're not sure?
I think we have a winner.
You are cordially invited to attend Hey!
I don't have a problem with you Francis.
Look, Stevenson this place is horrible enough.
So the poquito cabeza thing stops now.
Okay?
Just stop.
Just stop.
Just stop packing.
You were protecting me.
I know we don't have, like, a formal agreement or anything but my act of courage was kind of dependent on your role as my bodyguard.
I'm sorry, Francis.
You're sorry?
Do you have any idea what these guys are going to do to me?
Four words: Nana has a fever.
End of discussion.
So what am I supposed to do?
Remember that move I taught you?
Yeah.
Don't even try it.
: Francis, boom-ba-yay.
Francis, boom-ba-yay.
Francis, boom-ba-yay I have to admit, it's kind of catchy.
Francis, boom-ba-yay.
Did you have fun tonight, Malcolm?
I guess, but isn't it kind of early to be going to bed?
It's not even 8:00.
Don't worry.
That puzzle will still be there in the morning.
Now I know you boys want to do a little chatting before sleepy time.
Let's say four minutes.
Mrs. Kenarbin can be a tad strict.
She doesn't know that sometimes boys have to be boys.
Am I right?
I can't move.
Welcome to the club.
I'm never going to fall asleep.
It's too early.
Want to tell ghost stories?
No.
I want to do that dinosaur model.
Ms. Kenarbin: Everything all right in there, boys?
Um, yeah.
A plush toy just fell on the floor.
We're fine.
You can't.
I just did.
Your parents need to cut you some slack.
They just want me safe.
No, they want you to be four.
Stevie, parents aren't allowed to control everything you do.
- Sometimes you just have -  Sorry.
Conditioning.
Come on.
I got an idea.
We're going to get you out of here.
Don't.
It's alarmed.
- You got me?
- Yeah.
You got me?
No!
I didn't know you cared.
Okay.
You want maturity.
Here's three weeks of social studies homework.
Now I'm one week ahead.
Plus, I called Grandma.
Woman : Hello.
Hi, Grandma.
It's Reese.
- Who's this?
- Grandma, it's Reese.
No, I won't accept charges.
It's Reese.
I'm very tired.
Please.
It goes on like that for another ten minutes but I still want credit.
Honey, I'm very proud of you but you still haven't proven you're old enough to extend your bedtime.
Come on, Mom.
I'll do anything.
All right.
Tell you what.
You can stay up and watch the movie if you put Dewey to bed.
Oh.
Anything else.
That's the deal.
You give him his bath, you put on his pj's you read him a story.
Lois, have a heart.
Take it or leave it.
I'll take it.
Come on, Dewey!
It's bath time!
You know he doesn't stand a chance.
I know, but at least it'll give us the night to be alone.
Oh.
I love the way your mind works.
Honk.
Smoothie.
I'm winning.
I lost.
Yes.
I got another quarter in my chair.
They stole his wheelchair.
What's it look like?
It's a chair with wheels.
I'll go get a form.
I don't need a form.
I need a wheelchair.
I'm screwed.
You're not screwed.
We just got to get you home.
We'll deal with everything else What are we going to do now?
Carry me like a backpack.
Stop!
Stop!
Gonna puke.
Dewey: Ow!
Let me go!
Come on, Dewey.
It's me.
You like me.
No, I don't.
Dewey, please!
How much does my head weigh?
Zero.
Zero.
Remember the last time we had a quiet moment together like this?
Bob's funeral.
Yeah.
Oh, that was nice.
And you look great in black.
Oh You do.
You do.
Let the machine get it.
Mmm.
Francis: Mom, Dad, hi.
Listen, something's come up.
Sorry about the way I sound but I'm calling from inside a washing machine.
Don't worry, I think I'll be fine as long as Oh, hi, guys.
How's it going?
Hey, hey, what are you doing with those quarters?
Hey, you guys, you don't want to Hey, come on!
Morning dew.
You know all my secrets.
Mmm.
Well, we've been together a long time.
Well, don't worry.
I know all your secrets, too.
No, you don't.
: Oh, yes, I do.
No.
I'm a man of mystery, Lois.
Okay.
Let's hear one.
Let's hear a secret.
Well, it's not really a secret as much as it is a fantasy but it's a little embarrassing, so Well, so whisper in my ear.
Aha.
Just kidding.
Just kidding.
Saw it in a movie once.
Don't want to do that.
That's  Oh, God.
I gotcha.
We can do that.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Reese: Get back here!
Okay, I just have to pick up a few things.
Give me 20 minutes?
I'll be waiting.
Yes!
Honey?
Honey.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Thank you!
Thank you!
Your car keys.
Right.
That's a nice cart.
Thanks.
It's new.
Downtown rocks.
What's that?
A stripped car.
What's that?
A naked man arguing with a wall.
What's that?
A nudie bookstore with my dad coming out of it.
Hmm?
Oh.
Here you go.
Daddy is gonna get some love tonight Stevenson: Perhaps you'll survive-- perhaps not.
Many have perished at the hands of the grand executioner.
They are the lucky ones.
: Are you scared?
Actually, now that you mention it no.
What?
Scared now?
No.
I'm just kind of itchy.
Huh?
You are hanging over a bottomless pit.
In five seconds, I will cut the rope.
Are you scared now?
I'm really not, no.
Why not?
This stuff is way scary.
Sorry.
It just feels so amateurish.
I mean, I know you guys are trying, but I've been tormented by the best.
Let me tell you a little bit about the master.
Lois: Traveling?
!
He wasn't traveling!
Why don't you put your glasses on?
You're missing a great game!
Oh, oh-oh, you're going to give me a technical?
!
You're going to give me a technical?
!
You can't give me a technical!
!
!
Look at that little pee-pee.
Oh, Francis, I forgot how tiny you are.
Oh-oh-oh-l-l That's the moment of his birth.
You see?
See him coming out feet first?
Doctors said it was the biggest mucus plug they'd ever seen.
An eight-inch scratch on the car, Francis!
Do you know how much that'll cost to fix?
!
If you think you are ever, ever borrowing my car again you are sadly mistaken!
And I saw that tattoo,Jimmy!
I'm telling your mother!
And that's just the stuff I didn't block out.
Oh, man!
What have we been doing?
This is all so wrong.
We've got to stop treating people like this.
Yeah.
If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right.
You will never amount to anything.
Why can't you just apply yourself?
!
Do you enjoy seeing me suffer?
Is that what this is?
After all I've done for you and this is the thanks I get?
!
We passed that couch an hour ago.
I know where we're going.
Oh, no, I don't.
This sucks.
You complain a lot.
I'm sorry, but tonight hasn't exactly been the most fun in the world.
Not tonight.
All the time.
You never stop bitching.
Okay, great.
You're going to do this now?
Fine.
You were right.
We shouldn't have snuck out of your house.
We shouldn't have gone to the arcade.
It was stupid of me for even thinking about it.
It was a dumb idea.
No.
Good idea.
Execution sucked.
Your chair.
Hey!
I'm slowing you down.
Get them yourself.
Okay.
Uh uh Get out of the chair.
Right!
You better be running!
Hey, Stevie, I got your Oh, my God!
Stevie, are you okay?
!
Can't feel my legs.
That's not funny.
Lois: Is there anything I can do to get out of the ticket, Officer?
Hal: Just love me.
Aw, geez, Hal-- Is that it?
Can't he be a sensitive cop?
Woman: That puppet-- It's alive!
Tonight was awesome.
Well, we kind of got lucky.
I was sort of hoping to get caught.
What?
Never been in trouble.
Like to see what it's like.
Sometimes you're such a Krelboyne.
I guess we are in trouble after all.
Malcolm?
Malcolm.
Malcolm?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Everybody up!
Let's go!
Let's go!
I got to do laundry before work!
I am taking breakfast off the table in five minutes!
I know this kid his mom wakes him up with a kiss on the forehead.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair Okay, I've been up for half an hour.
I've had my cereal.
It's time for Mom to ask the same annoying question she asks me every morning.
So, Malcolm, what are you doing in your genius class today?
Nothing.
It's just as dumb and boring as being in regular class, except now I get ostracized.
Ostracized?
Oh, you're learning such big words.
Hey.
They want to know what I think about caller I D blocking.
Do I think about that?
Oh!
What?
Nothing.
Just a sharp Cheerio.
Oh!
Hah!
$21 0!
Look at all the calls that Francis is charging to us.
Oh, 80 minutes-- And every one of these calls is to Beebee.
$21 0 on Beebee!
I know.
Now, honey, just try to understand.
He's off in Alabama.
He's all by himself at military school.
He's lonely, so he calls his little girlfriend.
She's a tramp.
No one's saying she's not a tramp.
Didn't you change our code number?
Three times.
I don't know how he's getting it.
That'll be good till the bill comes on the 1 5th.
Thanks, man.
You are a good brother.
I was taking money out of her wallet anyway.
He is doing this just to upset me.
Oh, come on, Lois.
He's 1 6 and thinks he's in love.
What are you going to do?
Oh, man, never ask her that.
Beebee, you can't imagine how much I miss you.
It is like a white-hot fire burning in my chest.
The only thing that keeps me going is just the thought of holding you and stroking your hair and being with you in a perfect, golden moment.
Oh, yeah.
I'm totally the same way.
Oh, I'm just so Are you watching Buffy?
I can do both.
You know, I think of things, too, like No, it's too embarrassing.
Tell me.
It's not the kind of thing you can say over the phone.
It's something I'd have to show you.
Beebee, I think it would be better if you told me, and then you showed me.
Stanley, what are you doing?
That was Beebee!
Sorry, man.
Commandant says your phone privileges have been revoked for a month.
Your mom complained about the bills.
Okay, let me just tell Francis, do you remember the thumb thing?
The one you did to my thumb, or the one you did with your thumb?
Hello.
Malcolm!
Thank God.
I don't have any more quarters, so just listen.
I need you to swipe Mom's credit card and I need you to buy me a cell phone.
What you want to get is the unlimited off-peak plan, and then FedEx it to me.
Francis, no.
I can't do that.
What?
Dude, don't bail on me.
I'm sorry, but Mom is totally on the warpath about the phone calls.
Her radar is up.
I can't do anything.
Seriously, you've just got to find a way to live without calling Beebee all the time.
Hello?
Hello?
He understands, right?
Dearest Beebee, something wonderful has happened.
The pain and confusion of the last few months has disappeared, replaced by a single glorious purpose.
From the ashes of the old Francis rises a new man filled with boldness and determination.
I fly to you on angel's wings, knowing I follow the mandate of my heart.
Every night for the past two weeks.
He thinks there's a monster under the bed.
It seemed so funny when we thought of it.
Oh, sweetie, not again.
The monster!
It tried to suck my brain out!
All right, I have had it.
You two are banned from Nintendo.
Okay.
We're already banned from Nintendo.
The sad thing is he thinks he just outsmarted her.
All right, fine.
Pillows.
What?
That's right.
I'm taking your pillows.
Come on, come on, hand 'em over.
And I'm not getting up again.
If that monster wants to suck out your brain, you just let him take it and you go back to sleep.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
We're all  Hello?
Don't scream.
It's me.
Francis!
Way to go, dipwad.
You got me in the nards.
Francis, what are you doing here?
I'm taking control of my own destiny.
I'm just picking up Beebee and we're going to head off for Canada.
You're going to visit Grandma?
No, a different part of Canada.
Someplace wild where people don't have to destroy love just 'cause they don't understand it.
You just ran away from school?
Mom's really going to kill you now.
No, she won't because she won't know.
Malcolm, you can't tell anybody.
I'm placing my life in your hands here.
Did you roll around in something?
You'll get used to it.
Look, I need you to get Beebee to come see me tonight, okay?
Give her this.
Let it air out for a while first.
Try to get me some food, 'cause I haven't eaten in, like, 36 hours.
Francis, this sounds kind of drastic, even for you.
Malcolm, I do not have time for doubt!
The die has been cast, my future is set.
Now, there's one question in my mind-- Can I trust you?
But Can I trust you?
Yes.
Yeah, definitely.
I'll toss my lunch bag over the fence before school.
Oh!
Uh!
Mmm!
Can I have some?
Can't.
It's a prescription sandwich.
''Prescription sandwich''?
Stevie, that's not even a good lie.
If you don't want to share, just say so.
Don't want to share.
Let's play Ironside.
I'll be Ironside.
I don't want to play stupid Ironside.
What's your problem?
It's my brother Francis.
He escaped from military school and hitchhiked all the way here.
He's all scraped up and smelly and hungry and dirty, and now he's hiding out at the creek.
If my parents catch him, he's dead.
He's talking like he's crazy.
I don't know what to do.
Squeal.
What?
Squeal.
Rat him out.
I can't do that.
He's my brother.
I promised him.
I can't tell anybody.
You told me.
Yeah, but by the time you tell anyone he'll be a thousand miles from here.
Tou chÃ©.
Beebee What?
Oh, you're that kid.
My name's Malcolm.
I'm Francis's brother.
You met me, like, ten times.
Yeah, you're the freaky little brain, right?
Just be cool.
What do you want?
Here.
Francis is back home.
Well, he's not home.
He's hiding.
Huh.
Three pages?
Both sides.
He loves to make me read.
What's that word?
''Consummate.
'' It means he likes you.
Oh.
''Assignation, rendezvous, tryst''?
How the hell is anyone supposed to know what he's talking about?
Beebee,just meet him at the creek at 7:30, okay?
See?
You can say it in English, and you're, like, ten.
What are you doing?
I'm wearing a tank top.
Beebee, I don't think Don't think.
Just walk.
Go.
The worst part is, I think I'm stealing panty liners.
Gosh, I had such a good day at work today.
I got to work the cash-only line for the first time in a month, and my register came out to the penny.
Plus, that creepy new assistant manager sliced his hand open with a box cutter.
Spent the whole afternoon in the emergency room.
Here's to him.
Honey, this chicken is absolutely delicious.
Oh, well, it's a little recipe I came up with.
It's Shake 'n' Bake-- but for pork.
How about that?
That's one for the recipe box.
Let's call it, uh, ''chork.
'' All in favor?
No one for ''picken''?
Chork it is.
Brava.
Oh, cut it out.
You big talker.
Will this make me taste better to the monsters?
Sure it will, son.
Get out of here!
You're not eating it.
You haven't had a bite in two minutes.
I'm saving it.
There is no saving.
Malcolm, he's right.
The rule is no saving.
Oh, yeah, I care.
Cut it out!
Come on, it's mine.
Boys, boys, stop it.
You're going get your mother out of You're going to ruin her nice day.
Francis did what?
!
Another night in the chat room.
That kid!
He thinks he can run away from school like some kind of escaped convict?
If he thinks he can just vanish in the night and I won't find him, well, he is sadly mistaken.
Lois, you just calm down.
There's nothing we can do right now.
Yes, there is.
I can call the police.
They're not going to look for anybody unless they've been missing 48 hours.
Not if I say he has drugs on him.
Lois, stop it.
You have to accept the fact that, for now, this is beyond your control.
Francis is going to have to sink or swim on his own, and frankly, I don't think that's such a bad thing.
In the meantime, we just have to leave it up to fate.
Fate.
Fate is just what you call it when you don't know the name of the person screwing you over.
Mom, I'm sure he's okay.
Uh-oh, tactical error.
Why do you think he's okay, son?
Because he's always okay.
Malcolm, this is a very serious situation here and I know you love Francis as much as we do, so if you have any idea Oh, for God's sake!
Where is he?
!
He came here to see Beebee.
Oh, my God, how'd she do that?
I knew it.
When did you talk to him?
Don't look at her eyes.
This morning.
And Dewey shoved a sandwich in the VCR.
Malcolm, where is he?
Got to think.
Diversion Delancey Park.
He's meeting her at Delancey Park by the soccer field.
Well we'll just see what fate has in store for Francis.
Francis, I have to tell you Is Beebee coming?
Yeah.
But I have to tell you something first.
I ratted you out to Mom.
What?
!
I didn't mean to.
Mom did her eyes and her voice, it was I didn't mean to.
Malcolm, how could you do that?
I trusted you.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Look, I sent her to the park.
You've got an hour to get out of here and have a head start before Are you crazy?
I can't go anywhere.
Beebee's coming.
Beebee.
Francis, what's wrong with you?
Why are you getting in trouble for her?
You don't understand.
Duh!
No one understands.
She's not nice, she's not smart, she's a thief, she's not even that good-looking.
And, oh, guess what else.
She treats you like crap.
I know.
You do?
Of course I do.
There's something you don't know.
What?
That no one in her whole life has ever loved her the way that I do.
All she has to do is see that, and everything will change.
I really thought he had something better.
Look, Malcolm, you'll understand when you're older.
Now,just go.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Mind your own business.
Who were you talking to?
I wasn't talking to anybody.
You're imagining it.
I heard you talking.
Okay, I'll tell you.
But you have to keep it a secret.
You know the monster under your bed?
It's called a Sasquatch.
He hunts back there during the day.
I was throwing him some raw meat so he wouldn't come get us tonight.
I don't think I gave him enough.
So, if I were you, I'd keep very quiet and stay the hell out of there.
Get it?
Move!
Beebee: Francis?
Beebee?
Francis?
Don't move.
I want to remember this forever.
Where are you?
No!
Don't look at me!
I wanted so much to be perfect for you, but I couldn't find any soap.
I'm hideous.
Really?
Yes.
But it's okay.
Everything is okay now that we're together.
I can't tell you how beautiful you look at this moment.
You look like an angel or a perfect dawn or a galaxy of stars.
I don't think we should see each other anymore.
And my heart soars when I think Did you hear what I said?
I um What?
Look you're a nice guy, and all those letters you sent-- The stuff that I understood, anyway-- was sweet, but I don't know.
It feels different now.
It's hard to explain.
Would you try?
Well, maybe I just like the long-distance thing 'cause, you know, you'd call and you'd talk and you'd make me feel so good about myself, and I didn't have to do anything.
Yeah, that's it.
Beebee, please.
I just think it's better we end it now before anybody gets hurt.
I'm sorry, Francis.
Ow.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
: Ow!
Get out of here!
You stupid, dumb monster!
This is my house!
Ow!
Go away!
Leave me alone!
Ow!
You.
You there.
What do you think you're doing?
Excuse me?
Do you know how dumb and careless you're being?
- Well, I brought - I''m not talking about that.
But shame on you.
Don't you know how this is all going to end?
Do we know you?
No, but I know you.
You're young and pretty.
You love to get 1 6-year-old boys so twisted up they don't know what they're doing.
You think it's all in fun.
You don't care how bad you hurt him.
Let me tell you something, young lady.
Hearts are precious things.
You should be careful with them.
You!
You there!
What do you think you're doing?
The monster started growling, so I threw rocks at him and killed him.
He started flying around on rocket boots, and I got to ride inside his head, and now the monster's my friend, and we went to get Slurpees.
You did not.
You're just lying.
If that's what Dewey says happened, there's no reason to argue about it.
No one believes I beat the last level of Mortal Kombat.
Because that's just ridiculous.
No one beats Sub-Zero.
Leave it off.
So, Beebee broke up with me.
Oh.
You okay?
I think I'm fine.
There's a strange sense of peace that comes over you when you give up that last shred of dignity.
It's nice.
I'm really sorry.
Well, if you're going to love women, you have to expect the occasional flaming wipeout.
It's in the fine print, but you agree to it when you sign up.
So what are you going to do?
I'm going to go back to school.
I only missed a day, so it should be too bad.
There's a pack of farm girls that hang around outside the fence.
Probably check that out.
Later days.
Wait.
I'm sorry I ratted you out.
I just got scared.
Dude, it's ancient history.
Don't worry about it.
Well, can't you at least hit me or something, just so I feel like we're even?
You want me to hit you?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thanks.
Psych.
Ow!
Now we're even.
Ow!
Don't cry Dry those tears falling out of your eyes Don't cry How'd you find me?
Malcolm told me.
You know, you should probably rethink the whole ''trusting him with secrets'' thing.
How mad is Mom?
Well, let's just try to get a couple states behind us before we ask her.
So, how'd it go with Beebee?
We broke up.
Does it hurt?
Oh, yeah.
Well, son I wish I could say it gets easier, but I honestly don't know.
I've never been dumped.
Don't cry
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Let me go!
Get off it!
I can't breathe.
Ow!
Leave the squirrel alone and get the fire extinguisher.
Reese, no!
Blood tastes funny.
You better be naked when I get back.
Done.
?
?
Yes, no, maybe?

I don't know?

Malcolm Malcolm  How was that even remotely fair?
That's for us all having to go to your stupid Krelboyne picnic today.
You think I want you to go?
My special class is having a family day and, if that's not bad enough, it's on the weekend that Francis is home.
I'm going to look like a total idiot in front of him.
Pretty bunnies.
Pretty bunnies.
Luckily, I've got a brilliant plan to get out of this.
Oh, poor baby.
Yeah, I'm sick.
No, you're grounded for pouring perfectly good vegetable soup in the toilet and you owe me 49 cents.
I don't understand why you don't want to go to this picnic, Malcolm; I think it sounds like fun.
Yeah, sitting on the grass, eating barbecue.
It's Krelboyne.
It's not going to be on the grass because half the class is allergic and don't expect any meat either, because they all voted not to serve anything that ever had a mother.
Cousin Nancy doesn't have a mother.
That's right.
She has two daddies.
Oh, man, two guys as your parents?
That house has got to be a dude's paradise.
You know, there are a lot of proven health benefits to the vegetarian lifestyle.
In fact, I've been seriously considering it myself.
It'll be nice to meet the other parents.
I'm sure they're better than the carnival freaks in Reese's class.
What a horrible bunch of people.
Amen to that.
Well, this just sounds like a blast to me.
Why do I have to go, again?
Because it's a family picnic, Francis, and you're a member of this family.
Right, see, I just keep forgetting that, being forced to live a thousand miles away at military school and all.
Well, I can't wait to see this academic circus.
I bet it's really cute.
It's not a circus.
It's a bunch of social misfits doing a bunch of weird stunts to show off how smart they are.
What's your weird stunt, honey?
Just some lame thing-- nothing you want to see.
You've got to get me out of there before my turn comes.
Why?
What's the big deal?
It just is, okay?
I don't want to do my act.
All right, relax.
We'll hang out for like 1 5 minutes, establish your presence, then we'll go over the fence like at Grandma's wedding.
That's why I love this guy.
Welcome!
Welcome, one and all!
Run away with us and join the circus!
The academic circus!
Oh, no.
My teacher.
Malcolm, thank goodness.
I was so nervous.
I had a dream you didn't come, and I was being chased by something big but invisible and-- Never mind.
You're here, and that's all that matters.
Hello, little guy.
Ready to leave your family and join the circus?
- Oh.
- Huh?
Little lower, son.
Oh, look at all your little friends.
Hi.
Hi there.
They're not my friends.
They're a bunch of geeks and losers.
Malcolm's in the house!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
I'm going to kick so much Krelboyne ass today it's not even funny.
Go, Malcolm!
Go, Malcolm!
Go, Malcolm!
Easy.
You got all afternoon.
We're getting out of here in 1 5 minutes, right?
Make it ten.
Yeah Ooh, hello.
And who might you be?
What?
Nothing.
Hello.
I'm Lois.
This is Hal.
We're Malcolm's parents.
That's very nice.
I'm Dorene.
These are the girls.
Hello, nice to meet you.
Yeah, it's really Whatever.
Hope everybody likes brownies.
Oh, my, that is so thoughtful.
Are those nuts?
Walnuts.
Oh gee we can't have that.
Some of the children are severely allergic to nuts.
Oh, my gosh, I had no idea.
Whose child is allergic?
Well, no one in this class specifically, but you can never be too careful.
Believe me, this isn't meant to publicly humiliate you.
I'm sure they were delicious.
Oh, hi, fellas.
Hey there.
What's your pleasure-- nature dog, health patty, tofu square?
Good God.
Want me to brown that chicken leg a little more for you?
Well looks like I got here just in time.
Gentlemen behold.
Is that meat?
Nothing but.
Hi.
Hey.
So, uh you here?
Yeah.
You?
Yeah.
Hey, Stevie.
Can't stop to chat.
Got to get my chemicals in the shade.
I thought you were doing your report on oscilloscopes.
Changed to catalytics.
It's more exciting.
Right?
What do you care?
I'm up after you.
So?
Following you is like following Streisand.
Well, don't worry about it.
You won't be following me.
Why?
Have I been bumped?
Francis, what are you doing?
!
Come on, the coast is clear and it's already been ten minutes and-- We're not ditching out, are we?
A small pack of Krelboynes has ventured out of hiding to bask in the afternoon sun.
Their defenses down, they're an easy target for nearby predators.
They sense danger, but it is too late.
Their hesitation is fatal.
And the circle of life goes on.
Kafkaesque, isn't it?
Huh?
Never mind.
Kick his butt, Alphonse.
Wait wait.
Here it comes.
Yes, there!
I've arrested the cellular mitosis!
Thank you, Dabney.
That was riveting.
Our next act needs no introduction, having been the buzz of last year's math fair.
Please welcome Flora Mayesh and Fermat's Last Theorem!
Hello?
Is this?
Testing.
So, I understand that Malcolm has quite the vocabulary.
Yeah, he's just yap, yap, yap, yap, yap all day long.
Well, that's not the vocabulary I meant.
It seems that he's taught several of the children the ''R'' word.
The ''R'' word?
I'm sure it's just something he picked up off the street-- certainly not at home.
Yeah, well, ''R'' you, lady.
So, this is going well, right?
It's pretty much everything I expected.
So, you ready, Malcolm?
I mean, you're all set, right?
Sure.
Good.
I'm ready.
Thanks for asking.
You know what's so great about our relationship?
It just still feels so fresh, you know what I mean?
Totally.
All right, take it away.
I need two burgers and a dog, Hal.
Coming up.
Dewey?
Thank you, sir.
All right.
Thank you.
What have I told you about raw meat, son?
I'm not.
Dad, I want you to meet someone.
This is Jody.
Hi.
Oh, it's so great to finally meet you.
Francis talks about you all the time.
Oh, yeah?
You, too.
Oh I'm so glad that went well.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you the Nixon electromagnet.
Turn it off!
.
This is going dreadfully.
Am I wrong?
Please tell me I'm wrong.
Excuse me.
For what?
This is it.
You're almost up.
Stop reminding me.
Nervous?
No, I just don't want to do this.
Don't you ever get sick of being a Krelboyne?
Of people thinking you're some kind of freak?
You are what you are.
Accept it.
Not without a fight.
You're harshing my buzz.
Don't let anyone mess with my stuff.
You know, in the wrong hands, these chemicals can make a pretty powerful stink bomb.
These hands look wrong enough.
And this field trip to the historic ghost town, I think we all know what that leads to-- the occult, devil worship, state colleges.
So then it's agreed that the trip will be canceled.
Wait a minute.
You can't decide that.
You didn't even vote.
I was only going by the general tone of the group.
General tone?
I haven't heard a peep out of any of these other women all day.
What, you all agree with what Mrs. Control Freak here is saying?
Well-- Phyllis!
My name isn't Phyllis!
And, no, I don't feel that way.
I don't either!
I never liked-- My husband told me to stand up to you after I came home from that bake sale in tears.
My soy burger it's bleeding!
This is meat!
We're eating meat!
Oh, my God!
We're eating meat!
Get out of the way!
Come here!
Okay, the difference between a stink bomb and a level-three toxic biohazard is apparently two extra drops of sulfur tetroxide.
I'm totally suing that web site.
- I didn't do it!
- I didn't do it!
I want a receipt.
I'm kind of conflicted.
On the one hand, I ruined Caroline's picnic and very possibly endangered a hundred lives.
On the other hand, now I don't have to do my act.
Did you miss me?
Mm-hmm.
So who was that girl with her hands all over you?
What girl, the paramedic?
She was making sure I didn't inhale any toxic fumes.
Oh, I'm sure you loved every moment of it.
God, would you quit nagging me?
Maybe if you paid a little more attention to me.
More attention?
You're smothering me.
I need space.
Oh, you'll get your space.
We're through.
Fine by me.
Here's the school ring you gave me.
The teddy bear key chain.
- Your shirt.
- Your two poems.
The book you lent me.
Your Depeche Mode tape!
And here's your gum.
I love Krelboynes.
And I swear, I'm not just saying that.
Why would I?
Nice hang time.
Well, it's really a simple function of the tensile strength of the elastic waistband.
I brought you a hamburger.
This should make us even, right?
Thank you.
Is this meat?
Uh, it might be.
Look what I've been reduced to.
Okay, well, um I'm going to Oh, Malcolm, I'm so sorry.
Huh?
I know how much you were looking forward to doing your act, especially with your family here.
I failed you.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
After today, they're going to fire my ass so fast.
My parents were right.
I never should have left the cannery.
Want another hamburger?
Yes!
I do.
I do.
I really, really do.
I really do.
Can you believe it?
Meat.
I don't know about you, but I'm outraged.
I want you to know that I am going to see to it that you never serve on a school committee, hold an office or even so much as set foot in a P.T.A. meeting as long as I can help it.
Is that a promise, lady?
'Cause I'd really like to get that in writing.
I should have expected as much from the mother of a foul-mouthed thug.
What he's even doing in this class, I don't know.
Oh, I see you made a friend.
Yeah.
Tomorrow we're going shopping for shoes.
Academic circus?
You got the circus part right.
This is the biggest debacle I've ever seen.
I guarantee you Principal Littledove will hear about this.
He sure will, from all of us.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
All women suck.
No, I mean you'd still like me even if you found out I was a freak, right?
The family wouldn't treat me any different, right?
Dude, we already know you're smart.
Yeah, but-- Never mind.
Just don't say I didn't warn you.
Look, it's Malcolm!
Hey, hey, Malcolm's going to do it, Dad!
The P.T.A. is on-line, missy.
Are you aware of the power of the Internet?
Hey, everyone look!
Look, Malcolm's doing it.
He's doing it.
Hey, shut the hell up!
Um could somebody, please, show me some credit cards?
Okay.
The numbers on them are: He's right!
Okay.
If you add the individual digits on each card you get 7 4 and 66.
If you multiply those numbers, you get 4,884.
How do we even know he's right?
Oh, he's right.
is 23,853,456.
The square root of 4,884 is 69 and 885/1 ,000.
The square root of that is eight and 3,597 /1 0,000.
Factor it!
The factors are 23 2 and 73.
Multiply it by pi.
- Cube it!
- 584 and 21 4/1 ,000.
The arc tangent!
Natural log!
- What's the reciprocal?
- 1 7 /1 0,000.
In base eight!
The capital of Iceland!
Reykjavik-- but that's not math.
Why can't you do that?
Cellular mitosis.
What are we paying your tutor for?
Do you have any brothers?
No.
Ow!
Hey.
Hi.
So, um how you been?
Fine.
You look good.
Yes, it was.
It was a wonderful circus.
So many people were worried-- Was it as bad as I think it was?
Man, you killed.
That's what I was afraid of.
Sorry you didn't get to do your act.
Shove the sympathy, showboat.
He fell on his butt and everything.
He was just, like, dazed.
Is Malcolm a robot?
No, son, he's just smart.
Very, very, very, very, very, very smart.
Hey, Malcolm how many fingers am I holding up?
Shut up.
Analyze what I had for lunch.
Get off me, you moron.
You know what I don't understand?
You rattle off those numbers but you can't remember to brush your teeth.
Hey, who's for Burger Barn?
Burger Barn!
Burger Barn!
Burger Barn!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Dewey: I hate my brothers.
I only like me.
I hate my brothers.
I only like me.
I hate my brothers.
I only like me.
Stop it right now!
I mean it!
When are you going to be done?
Soon as I can, honey.
I said, stop it!
Dewey: I hate my brothers.
I only like me.
I hate my brothers.
I only like me.
''Five across.
My mother the blank.
'' Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
I know a lot of kids say they like school.
But honestly, I just find it exhausting.
I mean, when I am in school I'm either bored, terrified or confused aboutJulie Houlerman.
Hi, Malcolm.
Perfect example.
What does she mean by that?
Is it just ''Hi''?
Is she trying to say she likes me?
Is she just being nice?
And now I have to figure out a secret way to answer her without A) acting like I like her or B) acting like I don't like her or C) acting like I've never even thought about A or B. Just be pleasant and noncommittal.
Hey,Ju She's doing this to me on purpose.
Hey, how are you?
Stanley, you are incredible.
I thought Malcolm was a genius but this is off the charts.
The school asked for an honor guard.
I figured you'd like a few weeks without drill practice.
A pageant, though.
Beautiful girls with self-esteem issues.
It's perfect.
Easy.
Let's start with the obvious runners up.
They're going to be the neediest.
You know, uh, this is a little intense.
You, me, working this shelf together.
What's intense about it?
I guess nothing.
Excuse me.
Mom!
You're not supposed to yell in the store.
Not supposed to do that either.
Life's funny that way.
Hey the Three Musketeers.
Athos, Aramis and you must be Porthos.
You're creepy.
You really shouldn't say hurtful things to grownups.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
We're still friends.
Craig you have got to redo the nail polish.
The crystal pinks are mixed with the frosty pinks are mixed with the God knows what.
Right away, Mr. Pinter.
Okay.
I'm off work in five minutes.
Don't touch the register.
Don't touch the candy, the price tags and don't touch the microphones.
That includes by accident.
That includes just looking.
That includes hovering with your finger a half inch away from it.
Fair warning.
Dare you.
Go ahead.
You do it.
- I'll do it.
- Yeah, right.
I will.
This isn't baby stuff, Dewey.
Go ride the horsy out front.
Horsy.
I got to remember that.
The microphone, register candy price tags steam cleaner.
Boys!
It's not what it looks like.
Oh, hello, boys.
How long you in for?
Another hour.
Yow.
Hi, Hon.
Hi.
Did you see Dewey outside?
Oh, what's wrong?
I don't know, but something's upsetting him.
He didn't say a word on the way home and now I just can't find him anywhere.
Hmm.
Hey, I'll check his special place.
Dewey?
You in there, buddy?
No.
What's wrong, pal?
I did something bad.
They told me to ride a horsy and I'm not a baby but I would have played with the carpet cleaner and I didn't have a quarter anyway.
Uh-huh.
Dewey, honey Daddy's getting a cramp in his leg.
What did you do?
I took something from Mommy's store.
Well, that's very serious.
What did you take?
A candy bar?
No.
It's not a candy bar.
Oh?
Well, what is it?
$1 50 bottle of cognac?
How could you take this?
!
I'm sorry.
My God, would you look at this thing?
Can you imagine the man who spends $1 50 on a bottle of cognac?
What do you think a guy like that pays for socks?
Dewey, what am I going to do with you?
This works pretty good, Mom.
Get your jacket, we're going back to the store.
You are going to return this bottle to Mr. Pinter apologize and accept the consequences.
What do mean, ''fired''?
!
You can't fire me for this.
Sorry.
Store policy is very clear about stealing.
But he didn't steal it; he returned it.
Right there.
The bottle is perfect.
You can just put it right back on the shelf.
I already marked it out of inventory.
Pinter: My hands are tied here.
What are you talking about?
You don't even do inventory.
You foist if off on me because you make so many mistakes.
You're not exactly making me regret my decision here, Lois.
Mom?
Oh, honey, it's okay.
It's okay.
This is just an excuse.
You have hated me since the minute you got here because I was first choice for your job and I turned it down.
You know, you think what you want, okay?
At least I didn't raise a thief.
-  -   Velcro.
I win the pool.
: Sweet home Alabama  where the skies are so blue.
Sweet home Alabama Lord, I'm coming home to you.
Oh, very, very nice, Bridget.
That was very nice.
Oh, Francis, I wanted to thank you again for being so helpful.
Usually, the honor guards just sit around and gawk but you've really thrown yourself into this whole hog, haven't you?
What can I say?
I love the theater.
Francis, will you help me decide on my leg extensions?
Which do you think looks better-- right leg or left leg?
Mmm Can you do both?
It's been ten days since Mom lost her job.
Yesterday for dinner, we had macaroni and rice.
Today it's rice and macaroni.
Mom, I can't eat this stuff anymore.
Reese, this is not the time for complaining.
I'm not complaining; I'm constipated.
I'm sorry, we can't afford to live lavishly anymore.
Drink your milk.
It's lumpy.
Then chew it.
Hey, come on, we can do this.
We've had to economize before.
Remember when Grandma drove into the living room?
Or last year, when we were saving up for Disneyland?
We're going to Disneyland?
No.
It's like that.
Except this time, we're just trying to keep the house.
Okay, everybody, stop worrying.
I am going to find another job another cashier job with flexible hours that allows me to leave whenever I need to take care of my kids.
Well, can't you get unemployment or something?
No.
I only worked They consider that part-time.
You know, I hope you are at least learning something from all this.
Yeah-- ''If you do something bad, don't tell.
'' No-- ''We did the right thing.
'' That's what's important.
Can't we at least do a load of laundry or something?
Everything I have stinks.
Yeah, he wants to smell good for Julie!
Malcolm.
Yeah, yeah.
It was worth it.
So we can't do laundry, we have to share baths and yesterday, she had our cable turned off.
Our cable!
How's your love life?
What?
So, basically, everything I tell you in confidence as a friend you're going to use to make fun of me?
I have nothing else.
Hi, Malcolm.
You want to split lunches?
What?
Yeah, sure.
I have a Chinese chicken salad, a tangerine and, ooh,Jordan almonds.
What do you have?
Leftover eggs from breakfast.
Oh.
Uh, I'm on a special diet for sports.
Oh, I forgot.
I have to go work out.
I'll see you later.
I can't take this anymore!
Everything I want, I can't have!
Anything that's nice, I can't do.
Everyone in the world gets to do everything except me!
Malcolm Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know there's other people worse off than me.
You know what?
I don't care.
I'm sick of going to school every day smelling like feet!
Malcolm I hate being poor, okay?
I mean, is that so bad?
Why is that like some big character flaw?
It's not my fault we're poor!
Malcolm!
You, um left your backpack.
Maybe you should try taking a really deep breath before you start talking.
Yeah.
Francis, where have you been?
I've been looking for you for days.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I've just been buried here.
Okay, listen, I've got kind of a bad news/ good news thing here.
Your mom lost her job, and we're pretty broke.
The good news is, that makes your tuition an issue.
Now, I think I can talk her into letting you come home.
Dad, no, I can't come home!
Marlin Academy is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
I am at a crucial point in my rehabilitation.
Uh-huh.
What's her name?
That's the thing-- There's, like, ten of them!
Check the peephole.
If they've got a hand truck, don't open it.
Craig, what are you doing here?
Lois, I just had a meeting with Mr. Pinter-- well, more like an hour begging, really-- but the point is, you can have your old job back!
Yes!
That is such good news!
And all you have to do is apologize and let him dock your pay and you have to work the graveyard shift for a couple months.
Oh.
Sounds good, Mom.
- No, thanks.
- What?
!
- You're kidding.
- Why?
!
Because that's like admitting he's right.
I'm not going to do that.
Lois, if this makes any difference I will work every graveyard shift right alongside you-- every single one of them.
Oh, hi, Craig.
What's going on?
Nothing.
Just business.
Take it easy, tiger.
We're working.
Well, I am.
Hi.
Back to the grind.
Nice guy.
Thank you, Tanya.
Tanya, that was fantastic.
I swear, when you put tap to it the Pledge of Allegiance just comes alive.
One suggestion: Do you have a tube top?
Oh, Francis, you are just wonderful.
I mean, you're so different than the local boys.
I mean, I haven't even known you that long and I already feel so connected to you.
I know.
It's almost mystical.
Yeah, and I'm so glad the gay thing isn't an issue.
You're gay?
No, no, silly.
You are.
Wait.
You think I'm gay?
Oh, you don't have to hide anything, honey.
I mean, we're a lot more liberal here than you think we are.
I mean, it's not like Birmingham.
Wait a minute.
You think I'm gay?
Why do you think I'm gay?
Oh, come on.
You like the theater, you're good with decorating and, well, you're completely obsessed with your mother.
Can you undo my hooks?
Tanya, I'm kind of having a dilemma here Oh, great.
Frannie, can you spray me?
My suit keeps riding up.
That's why I'm here girlfriend!
So what did you want to talk about?
I'm your teacher!
Can't we just talk?
You know, that Julie Houlerman is a very special little girl.
Oh, come on!
Caroline, I don't want to Caroline: Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm, so private, so guarded.
But you don't have to be that way with me.
I'm on your side.
Julie knows that.
She's not even in my class.
She talked to you?
About me?
What'd she say?
Aw, nothing that wasn't obvious already.
You know, when you open up to people you will always be surprised just how well things turn out.
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
Isn't it wonderful?
Julie organized the whole thing herself and everyone in school responded.
Dear Malcolm, this isn't just food.
It's an expression of how we all feel about you.
Our hearts go out to you in your time of need.
- You're going to keep the food?
- Yes.
I'm not going to throw away perfectly good pie filling and lamb chutney.
Don't you even care how humiliating this is?
We've done can drives.
This is just the crap people find when they clean out the garage.
Okay,just stop it.
I know how hard this is but no one ever said life is fair.
Sometimes decent, hard-working people get dumped on for no good reason.
They just have to wipe their eyes and keep on walking.
Something will turn up.
We just have to hold on a little bit longer.
And in the meantime be thankful for small favors.
Anyone want the last olive?
Those aren't olives.
Those are peaches.
Well, you got him here early, that's good.
He'll be fine in a few days.
Just like when this one ate the frog.
I only ate half of it.
I won't put the stomach pump on the bill.
I mean, he did most of the work on the way over.
Thanks, Don.
Uh listen, as far as the bill goes what kind of neighborhood are we in?
Well the emergency room couple of days of observation-- probably three or four.
Three or four hun?
Okay.
You boys take care of your dad.
I'm going to go see Mr. Pinter and beg for my job back.
What?
Mom, wait.
You don't have to do that.
Yes, I do.
I don't want to shouldn't have to, but guess what?
I do.
But I want you boys to understand something.
I am not going back on anything I said before.
She's completely going back on it but I'm not going to kick her when she's down.
You're totally going back on it.
No, I am not.
Everything I said before still goes.
You know, sometimes bad things happen and you don't understand why and you just have to trust that there's a good reason for it.
Sure, it's easy to work in mysterious ways when you have a job.
The first one who laughs gets their ass kicked.
You have incredible hands.
Well, it's easy on such a beautiful back.
Not to mention the most talented sweet and sexy What?
Francis are are you sure you're really how you are?
Tanya, I'm so confused.
I mean, I thought that I was, but when I'm around you I have these strange, new feelings.
I feel like maybe I could change.
That you could be the woman who changes me.
Oh, Francis I was hoping you'd say that.
I want to be that woman for you.
Mm, and don't you worry, honey.
If there's one thing we know how to do down here it's how to fix this.
And with God's help, we can say ''no!
'' to weakness.
We can say ''no!
'' to all things unnatural!
It is procreation, not recreation!
And when Satan tempts us, what do we do?
Pray out the gay.
Get to it!
I have to say, Lois, I'm surprised by this change in your attitude.
Yeah, well, me, too.
I know we've had our differences but I hope that we can make all this water under the bridge.
So, if you'll just sign here Mm, what's this?
Your apology.
I think I've captured your voice rather nicely.
You want it in writing?
Yes.
Look, Lois, you can tell these clowns whatever you want-- that I got on my knees and begged you to come back, I don't care.
I just want you and I to know how things really are.
That's not a signature.
No, it's more of a suggestion.
''The horse you rode in on'' is optional.
Now, look-- No, you look.
I don't deserve this.
The only thing I ever did wrong was all the work I did to cover your butt.
We obviously have different definitions of''wrong.
'' Yeah, I guess we do.
For instance, I think it's wrong for you to put your name on sales reports that you didn't write.
I think it's wrong you keep a little bag of''herbs'' in your bottom left drawer.
And slept with the district manager's wife.
And you want to know something?
You don't even have to worry about it because I also think it's wrong to blab this kind of thing.
You know, you should be so glad that I'm the only one that knows this stuff about you.
Anyone else here would sell you down the river in a second.
God, I am so much better than you.
Yeah, he just ran off and quit for no reason.
Huh, who knows why?
See, you do the right thing and everything works out for the best.
Clean.
I have Ho-Ho's-- real Ho-Ho's.
You know, I'm sure I'm neglecting my spiritual side, but money rules.
The best part is I can finally get everything straightened out with Julie.
Hi, Malcolm.
Look, we're not poor anymore!
So I don't want any more of your stupid pity, okay?
That helped, right?
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
What are you looking at, monkey boy?
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Reese!
What are you doing?
Help!
Ow!
Help!
Mom!
Cut it out.
Cut it out.
Ow!
Help!
It hurts!
Ow!
Knock it off, you little Reese, what the heck are you doing?
You can't leave that kid alone for five minutes without picking on him!
Reese: I didn't do anything, Mom.
I gave him that.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Honey, which juice don't I like-- apple or grape?
- You don't like either.
- Oh, right.
Malcolm, what is all this stuff from your teacher?
That woman sends home two or three fliers every day.
She says she wants the parents to be as involved as possible with the children.
At school?
It's the only break I get.
What exactly is ''Personal Fulfillment Week''?
Square dancing.
That's right, square dancing.
You should see it.
The Krelboynes dance on the tetherball courts in front of the whole school.
We laugh our asses off.
Excuse me?
Butts.
We laugh our butts off.
Open.
Swish.
Spit.
This tastes like crap.
Reese is right.
This class is turning me into a total weirdo.
You are not a weirdo.
You are gifted.
And if gifted kids are supposed to square-dance, then you'll do it.
Probably teaches you geometry.
Don't forget to mail these bills.
They're late.
Two blues, one pink.
We're doing better.
Don't get cocky.
They're hot until I deposit my paycheck.
You kids, let's get going.
You don't want them to do-si-do without you.
That's it.
For the sake of my manhood, today I'm ditching school.
Hey, why don't I drive you boys to school today?
Uh, that's okay, Dad.
I don't mind walking.
Oh, no, no, no.
I really want to.
A chance to spend a few extra minutes with my sons, enjoying their company Honestly, son, it'll be the highlight of my day.
Come on.
Great.
Now I can't even be mad at him.
Aw, Stanley.
Let me show you how it's done.
Uh-oh, eyes down.
That was good.
You didn't give them any satisfaction.
In another six months, they'll be bored with you.
Man : get out of this one.
Patterson has just reversed  That's got to hurt.
Mom was right.
I do get some sick thrill out of trouble.
Ow!
That skinny guy!
Come on, get him!
Commandant on the floor.
Ten-hut!
I smell smoke.
Who is responsible?
Very well.
We'll do it the hard way.
Patton.
Francis, please lift up your right foot.
Son, you have the worst attitude I've ever seen in 1 5 years at this institution.
You seem compelled to break every rule, to flout every convention.
You are never going to make it-- in the armed forces or anywhere else.
Now, I was never fortunate enough to serve in combat but I do know what it requires.
Look at this dog.
He is vicious, he is ungrateful and yet even he understands the importance of obedience.
Do you hear what I am saying, Francis?
Yes, sir.
I'll try to be more like a Jack Russell terrier, sir.
There will be no hot water for this floor for the entire month.
You can thank the cadet after I leave.
Francis: Ow!
Reese wiped his booger on my lunch bag.
What have we taught you about snitching?
''Only snitch when asked to snitch.
'' Good boy.
So, looking forward to school?
I guess.
That's a shame.
'Cause we're not going to school.
Where are we going?
Boys, I'm going to share something with you I hope you'll remember for the rest of your lives.
Now, I don't want to spoil the surprise but I've been planning this for years.
I just had to wait until you were all old enough to appreciate it.
Hookers?
If it gets me out of square dancing, fine.
Just sit back and enjoy the ride, boys.
We're rebels.
We're wild men!
Whoo!
Where did I put the damn paycheck?
Yeah.
Those guys are wimps.
That's not even half the size of the one I gave you just to get you out of riflery.
Hey, thanks for pulling them off me.
I owe you one.
One?
Hey, you want to see something very, very cool?
Oh, boy, what have you done now?
Francis: Oh, isn't he beautiful?
He only cost me $20.
I'm calling him Otis.
Did you listen to anything Spangler said?
You're already in enough trouble as it is without bringing in a pet.
Well, Spangler has that oversized gerbil.
And besides, Otis is not a pet.
Otis is a symbol.
Of what?
Of everything that is beautiful in the world.
Independence free thought.
I may be stuck here in this militaristic loony bin but at least some part of me can stay connected to the things that give me my humanity.
You're not going to turn me in, are you?
I don't know.
On the one hand, you're probably going to get caught because you always do.
Then, of course, I'll be involved even though I had nothing to do with it.
On the other hand it's a snake.
Good man!
I think I'm starting to bring out the rebel in you.
Touching.
Right.
Sorry.
Stock car races!
Oh, cool!
That's right, boys.
The real field of dreams-- only with concrete instead of all that grass.
I don't want to work Here we go.
Excuse us, please.
Oh, boys, boys.
You see that blue car down in front?
- Number 1 6?
- Yeah.
That is Rusty Malcolm.
Greatest man in the history of the sport.
Maybe the greatest man ever.
Six world records.
Inventor of the in-car urination system.
The list is endless.
And he came from nothing, just like you boys.
You see, this is Rusty's last race ever.
He's retiring.
So, I wanted to share him with you before he went so that you can see for yourselves how much you can accomplish in this world with a little persistence and determination.
Did you read that article in People about him getting a divorce?
Shut your filthy mouth.
You know, you were named after Rusty, Malcolm.
I was?
Yessiree, Bob.
Took me two kids to win that argument.
Announcer: And there they go.
Whoo!
Gentlemen, start your excitement, because here they come!
He won!
Rusty Malcolm won!
No, sweetheart.
That was just the pace lap.
How many laps are there?
Oh, hundreds.
We've got four hours of this.
Four hours?
!
Uh-huh.
Do we at least get to see any flaming wrecks?
Reese, it's not about that.
See, it's about strategy and technique.
It's about the melding of man and machine.
The wrecks are just sort of a bonus.
Dewey you can keep track of the laps.
Can we go get sodas?
What?
Already?
Well, okay.
Guess it can't be a special day without sodas, huh?
Here.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Get your dad a beer.
Take my I.D. Come on, Rusty!
Firecrackers.
Malcolm.
I'm going to say Reese.
Three rooms to go, and already I have enough evidence to ground them for life.
Dewey, stay with us.
You're going to get lost.
No, I won't.
Yes, you will.
You always do.
You know you could help.
I'm watching him.
He's right over Man, how does he do that?
Totally your fault!
He was right in your eye line.
You don't pay attention to anything!
I pay attention.
Score!
What are you doing?
: Too slow.
Come on.
Let's just go find Dewey.
This place sucks.
It's hot, it stinks nobody's T-shirts cover their stomachs and I'm bored out of my mind.
Hey.
Look at that.
Let's check it out.
I don't know.
It doesn't just say ''keep out.
'' It says ''forbidden.
'' And they wouldn't bother making it ''forbidden'' if it wasn't something totally bitchin' on the other side.
Wow.
I can't find a flaw in his logic.
Come on.
What's the worst that could happen?
We didn't do anything!
I'm a diabetic.
I need insulin.
Sit down!
You are such an idiot!
It actually was pretty bitchin'.
And I'm totally getting one of these for Christmas.
What does the sign say?
Woman: ''No soliciting.
'' Well, that includes Jesus.
No, it's Caroline Miller, Malcolm's teacher.
I need to talk to you.
Yeah, come on in.
Oh, spring cleaning?
Oh, ho.
Yeah, I'm cleaning house, all right.
I'm sorry to bother you at home but when Malcolm didn't show up for school today What?
Malcolm cut school today?
Yeah.
Actually, not just today.
Now, your first reaction is probably going to be one of understandable Wait!
''Ditching.
'' We have a winner!
Anyway, this week we've been doing a lot of work on folk movement and I-I think that Malcolm may be ditching because he's afraid that well, that he may not seem graceful.
Oh, you're serious.
Yes, I'm serious.
I think he may have body issues.
Look, honey, you're probably very bright but you've got a lot to learn about boys.
First off, they're able to think maybe three minutes into the future and it's our job to make sure that future comes crashing down on them within the time limit.
Otherwise, they never learn anything.
Help lift.
Eew!
What is that?
Don't be such a baby.
I'll get the tongs.
I'll be Kevin.
You be Clyde.
Think you can cry?
No.
I got to feel it.
Ooh, I got an idea.
No!
Just follow my lead.
No, Reese.
Whatever it is, no!
Well, I guess you boys had some time to think about what you've done.
Yes, sir.
Look, I, uh, used to be your age and I understand how tempting a place like that can be.
And I guess you kids really didn't do any major harm so I've decided to let you off You idiot!
Open it!
It's locked!
Okay, I think I can cry now.
Announcer: And Rusty Malcolm has retaken the lead with only 1 00 laps to go.
Rusty: Great beverage work, Hal!
My pleasure, Rusty!
Here comes Rusty Malcolm into the pits.
It's going to be four tires Hey, how about that, boys?
Well, this just plain hurts my feelings.
Oh, man.
Oh, ma Stanley, I'm sorry, I Wait.
I'm trying to see if I'm inspired by its symbolic bid for freedom.
No.
I'm just really pissed.
Okay, don't overreact.
It's just a snake, right?
So, it's got to be around here somewhere.
No big deal.
Spangler: Oh, my God!
Patton, no!
Hi, Mom.
Uh, I was just thinking about how much I missed you guys and I was thinking I should come for a visit, you know, like today.
There's a flight leaving in half an hour and I already booked it so I just need your credit card number to Well, honey, here's the thing.
Right now you are actually better off being as far away from me as possible.
But You got to trust me on this one, Francis or, uh, should I say ''Olaf Mortenson'' of Wheatville, Montana?
You know, I have learned more in two hours with you than I have in six years of teaching.
So, did your life turn out anything at all like you planned?
Oh, God, no.
Oh, when I was a girl I had all these crazy, romantic dreams.
I wanted to be a blackjack dealer in an Indian reservation.
Didn't work out.
Stubby thumbs.
Well, at least you have your home and your family.
All I come home to every night are three howling cats and Bob.
Who's Bob?
My shower head.
Do you have anything stronger?
I'm way ahead of you.
and it looks like Rusty Malcolm will win his final race!
Rusty!
I can't believe they're missing this.
Rusty Malcolm maintains the lead high off the third turn  What?
Oh, for the love of God!
What happened?
What happened?
Rusty do something?
Missed it!
What'd he do?
Men a terrible tragedy has befallen us.
At approximately 1 7 00 hours our beloved Patton was set upon by a serpent and devoured.
I, myself, fired a few rounds as it slithered away but, hampered by a lack of depth perception my efforts were useless.
Now after an incident such as this certain questions arise.
Leaving aside for the moment why God feels the need to take away everything that I love that leaves us with the matter of who is responsible.
Can you explain that, Francis?
Yes, sir.
I believe you lost that finger trying to start the school lawn mower.
What is in the hand?
They appear to be Raisinettes, sir.
They are snake droppings, found in your footlocker.
Now, what do you have to say for yourself?
Sir, I'm obviously the victim of an elaborate conspiracy to frame me.
It's just too perfect, sir.
Two months!
No hot water, no television and an 8:00 p.m. curfew for the entire academy!
Feel free to thank the cadet after I leave.
Could I ask one favor?
Send a picture to my mom with ''I told you so'' written across it.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Way to go, man.
What?
We hated that yappy, little rat.
Let's hear it for Francis, you guys!
This is an improvement, right?
Reese!
Rusty Malcolm wins the stock car Malcolm!
Hi, Dad.
Hi.
Where are your brothers?
Oh, geez.
Come on.
Uh what seems to be the trouble here, Officer, uh Karl?
These your boys?
Yes, sir, that they are.
Couldn't be prouder of them.
These are two of the worst kids I have ever encountered in my life.
And I work the state fair.
Really?
See, that must be fascinating-- Seeing people from all over, the different cultures I don't want to be a hard case here, but these kids physically attacked me.
Plus, they completely destroyed a $300 pneumatic drill which someone's going to pay for.
Well, this all sounds pretty serious.
But don't you worry, Officer Karl.
They are going to hear all about it when I get them home.
I'm just sorry that they had to put you through all of this.
That's not fair.
And I, uh, see, I fully intend to pay for  Clyde, Kevin!
Get to the car!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Ooh!
Okay.
All right, men.
Well, I hope you've all learned something today, huh?
I learned my dad is actually capable of doing something cool.
I'm not saying violence is cool, but that was cool!
I always wondered where we got it from.
Program tickets Huh.
Your mother's paycheck.
Now, boys, remember, as far as your mom knows I have been at work all day.
Okay, go on.
All right.
Well, at least she doesn't know I skipped school all week.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
''I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye '''tis but the pale reflect of Cynthia's brow ''nor that is not the lark ''whose notes do beat ''the vaulty heavens so high above our heads.
''I have more care to stay than will to go.
Come, Death.
And welcome.
'' Yes!
He nailed it!
Malcolm, that was wonderful!
So sensitive and full of passion.
It was just beautiful.
Before you say anything just remember we're best friends.
So that wheelchair isn't going to stop me from kicking your ass.
Bring it on, Homeo.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Lois: What do you mean what happens when you die?
You're dead.
That's it.
Now, honey, that's not quite true.
Actually, son, after death your body undergoes a fascinating series of changes.
First it bloats up like a balloon then shrivels like a raisin.
Then tiny microbes you can't even see, but are on you right now start to devour your flesh and return all the elements in your body back to the soil.
Now, some people will tell you that your hair keeps growing, but that's that's a myth.
It's actually your head that shrinks.
Now go get ready for Aunt Helen's funeral.
Julie, listen, I'm sorry I'm canceling out so late.
That's okay.
I mean, it's a funeral.
So, were you close with your aunt?
No, but I guess my mom was.
She keeps saying how important this is.
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
Especially since you're stuck with the extra ticket.
Well, that's okay.
Maybe I'll askJimmy to go.
Who's Jimmy?
Jimmy Westcott.
He plays football.
Bye.
Oh, yeah.
Life's fair.
Did you call that girl?
Yes, I called her and told her I couldn't go to the concert and now she's probably going to invite someone else.
Well, Malcolm, I'm sorry that my mother's sister-- the woman who took care of me every day after school-- had to die and inconvenience your social life.
She does it on purpose.
I could have made up a million different escape plans but now my brain is filled with mom guilt.
Who's this?
How should I know.
Hal?
Beats me.
Dewey is this a friend of yours?
Uh-huh.
Who is he?
I don't know.
What's your name, son?
Did he say Greg?
I thought he said Craig.
His name is Egg.
Egg?
I named him.
Well, you can't keep him.
He needs to go home, okay?
Okay.
This stinks.
Whether it's a wedding, funeral or court date these family gatherings are always the same.
I can't wait till I get zits.
At least then I can fight back.
Hal, you have to get ready.
Why are you still messing around with those record albums?
I thought I was going to spend today in the garage listening to them on my quadraphonic but now that we're going to the funeral I have to reseal the shrink wrap.
Hal!
I have to get my speech ready.
Honey, you know you don't have to talk at every funeral we go to.
I wish that were true.
You see how people look to me when they ask if somebody has a few words to say?
They're not looking to you they're looking at you.
To, at what's the difference?
Hello.
Hey, Mom, I'm just warning you someone claiming to be the Commandant might call you.
It's this guy down the hall.
Play along and pretend you believe him.
He's totally harmless.
I can't talk to you right now.
We're on our way to Aunt Helen's funeral.
Aunt Helen died?
Well, I sure hope so.
We're going to her funeral.
Well, when did she die?
Mom, why didn't anybody tell me?
We didn't want to have to worry you over nothing.
Nothing?
She's dead.
How's Uncle Fred taking it?
I don't think he's thought too much about it.
He died two months ago.
What?
!
Francis, I'm sorry.
I really have to go.
Here, talk to your brother.
Mom?
Hello?
All right, let's see it.
I can't breathe.
Fine.
You know the drill.
Upgrade.
See?
Problem solved.
Hello?
Oh.
Okay, well, you can wear one of the suits that Uncle Fred left you.
Aw, Mom, a dead suit?
Cool.
A dead suit.
Dewey, why don't you help your little friend find his way out?
Dewey: I did.
He keeps coming back.
This thing's an open casket, right?
I think so.
Why?
Because I'm going to stash this with Aunt Helen.
What is that?
It's a Mighty Man.
Mom and Dad had it in their closet for some reason.
It's Dewey's birthday next week.
This is his present.
Oh.
What'd you do to it?
I stomped on it.
Why would you do that?
Look, I don't know why I do the things I do.
I just know I don't want to get caught.
That's why Aunt Helen is getting a new friend.
You're going to bury that with her?
You are so dead.
Hey, I watch lawyer shows.
Mom will think I did it but she can't prove it without this.
It's in the Constitution-- No evidence, no conviction.
E pluribus unum.
: Oh, yeah.
Hi, honey.
I finally found my joke cards.
They were behind the water heater.
- Really?
- Hey, how's this?
''A priest, a rabbi and Uncle Fred are'' Aunt Helen.
''Are playing golf with Saint Peter.
'' Hal, please.
Have you seen my pun file?
It's in a box marked ''laughter thoughts.
'' Laughter thoughts?
How did she die?
Cats ate her face.
Dewey, I think you're confused.
I'm asking about Aunt Helen.
Cats ate her face.
Put Mom or Dad on the phone.
Hello?
Dad, what happened to Aunt Helen?
Cats ate her face.
Dewey knows more about it than I do.
Mom, I hate wearing Reese's hand-me-downs.
Look at this.
Jelly in the pockets, the fly's broken and it smells like wet dog.
Well, you should be glad he only wore it once.
You know, I'm trying to be there for Mom but the annoyances are starting to outweigh the guilt.
I'm this close to sneaking out of the whole thing.
Well, I suppose you're entitled to complain.
After all, it's only my Aunt Helen.
What is she, a mind reader?
And then there were ants on her bones and the police came.
Dad, listen can you think of anything that rhymes with cadaver?
How long is this funeral going to take?
Including traveling time?
All day.
I know, I know.
But it will make your mom happy.
Mom really loved Aunt Helen, huh?
Oh, God, no.
Your mom hated her.
What?
She hated her?
Everyone did.
Horrible woman.
I used to have to forbid her from calling here 'cause she always made your mom cry.
I can't believe Mom tricked me like that.
I'll tell you one thing-- I now consider myself totally free to ditch this funeral.
I got to callJulie.
Hello?
Malcolm!
Thank God, somebody I can talk to.
Sorry, I have to make a call.
So, your aunt's not dead?
No.
it turned out to be one of those comas where they think you're dead and they put you on the embalmer's table and you wake up at the last second.
It was a close call.
Uh, okay.
I guess we'll pick you up at 2:00.
Great.
I figure I'll commit to it first and come up with a plan later.
I always think better under pressure or is it when I'm not under pressure?
Oh, well.
Too late now.
I'm ready to go.
Yeah.
Hey!
You're taking a backpack to the funeral?
My back gets cold.
Fair enough.
Lois: Look, Francis I guess I get scattered.
You know, sometimes I forget what I told you and you're not here so I'm not there because you sent me away.
I swear, I'm not even a part of this family anymore.
Francis, it's very important that you understand that is not true but I don't have time right now.
I understand.
It's not like it's a matter of life and death.
Oh, wait, it is!
Anyone else die in the last five minutes I should know about?
You wanna know everything that's been happening?
Your father mowed the lawn Reese polished off all the cereal and I dropped a frying pan on my foot and I got a big black toe.
You want me to send a picture?
Egg!
Cut it out!
What is Egg?
Oh, he's a new boy in the house.
What?
!
Okay, it'll only hurt for a second and I'll get out of the funeral.
I can tellJulie a really cool story about how I got my black eye.
Aw, I'm so gutless.
Why are you taking so long?
Let's go.
Reese, listen.
I know it sounds crazy but I need you to hit me.
You idiot!
In the eye!
And leave a mark for Mom to see?
Forget it.
No bruises, no evidence no crime.
I guess we move on to plan '''' lying.
What book report?
I just remembered.
I have a big book report due tomorrow and I haven't even started reading it.
Standard technique-- You volunteer a small crime to distract them from looking for the big one.
So, what's the report on?
A Tale of Two Cities.
- Oh, how many words?
- 7 50.
Was that on your assignment sheet?
- No, it's an addendum.
- When did you get that?
Thursday.
I didn't bring it home.
That's why I forgot to do the assignment.
Ooh, nice one.
Well, I suppose if it's school work That's the mislead.
Wait for the reverse.
A Tale of Two Cities.
Who's that by?
Charles Dickens.
Oh, I thought it was Victor Hugo.
No, it's Dickens.
Is that the one with Jean Valjean?
That's Les Miserables.
No, no.
Isn't A Tale of Two Cities the one with Jean Valjean, where he's says ''It's a far, far better thing I do'' right before he steals a loaf of bread?
No.
Sidney Carton says that right before they behead him.
I thought you hadn't read it.
What?
No.
I said I hadn't written it.
And when is it due?
Tomorrow, I told you.
- On Les Miserables?
- Yes.
No!
-A Tale of Two Cities.
- Which you haven't read.
- Right.
- But you just said you did.
No, I-I said I didn't, and then you said it was Thursday, and Look, I just don't want to go to this stupid funeral.
There's no reason for me to go and I want to go to the concert with Julie!
Let's go!
I'll be waiting in the car.
Malcolm I am ashamed of you-- Wanting to deny your poor Aunt Helen her due.
No, that won't work on me because I know you didn't love Aunt Helen.
You hated her!
'Course I did.
What does that have to do with anything?
What?
Malcolm, this isn't about love.
It's about family.
We have a duty to this family and we are darn well going to do it.
But why?
It's not fair.
You can't just stick the word ''family'' in front of something and turn everyone else into slaves.
It makes no sense.
No one liked this woman so why do we have to pretend like we did now?
What good will it do anybody?
Hal?
I got nothing.
I could really use some support here.
Excuse me?
I am being incredibly supportive.
I'm giving up my entire day for this-this thing and you don't hear me complaining.
Hal, it was a bunch of old record albums.
You're not giving up something important.
Well, they're important to me.
You-You people.
I can't believe you.
I asked you to do one thing that You're not asking; you're ordering.
Lois: After all I do for this family.
I cook, I clean, I spackle, I plunge and none of it means anything to any of you people and the one time I ask you for something-- something that I shouldn't even have to ask you for-- and all I get are complaints!
Well, what about me, hmm?
You think I want to be cleaning out the gutters when I could be surfing the beaches of Europe or-or cruising around on my hog?
- What hog?
- Ah-ha!
Exactly.
Where's my hog?
!
Where do you think you're going?
I have had it!
From now on, no one has to do anything.
We could all just do whatever we want and I want to take a bubble bath!
Fine!
So, that's a ''yes'' on the concert?
Come on, come on.
Are you going to be in there all day?
If I feel like it.
Fine.
Just so you know, when I'm done in the garage I'm using the bathroom whether you're in here or not.
Mom, I think we should go to Aunt Helen's funeral.
I mean, she was a good woman.
It's the least we can do.
I don't know what you're trying to pull, but I don't like it.
Am I the only one that cared about her?
You're the good one.
Enjoy your moment in the sun.
Now, get out of here.
This is me time.
Hey, Reese, which one stinks more?
What's your problem?
You couldn't keep your big mouth shut until after the funeral.
I'll have to wait for another relative to die to bury this thing.
It could be weeks.
You'll think of something.
No, I won't.
You have good ideas all the time but for me, this was special.
Hey!
You can't leave this mess here.
I've got a guest coming over.
Too bad.
Thanks to you, no one has to do anything anymore.
It's anarchy, baby.
That's the word, right?
Um Mom?
I was just wondering if you could wash this shirt for me?
You must be joking.
But you're the only one that knows how to use the washer and dryer without getting shocked.
Please?
Well since you said please.
There you go.
All washed.
I think you've been in the garage long enough.
Okay.
Gosh!
Well, no, no, no.
You are going to get your own outlet.
Uh okay, here we go.
Okay okay, here we are.
Come on.
Come on.
Gotcha!
Oh.
No, not my problem today.
Hand me that loofah.
He wants juice.
Go get your own juice.
You said I'm not supposed to.
: You're right.
Okay, from now on you are officially old enough to get your own juice.
Poof.
Darn it.
Darn it.
Darn it.
Mom, I spilled!
So?
Clean it up.
Green apple soap.
Girls like green apples, right?
Oh, man, she got my pants wet, too.
: Hello?
Is Malcolm here?
Is Malcolm here?
!
Huh?
Malcolm?
!
Julie: Malcolm?
Julie!
Nothing.
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?
I just wanted to be nice.
People told me not to come to your house.
I thought they were just being silly!
Julie, I'm sorry.
Things aren't usually like this.
Just give me a minute and I'll be ready to go.
I don't want to go anymore!
Just leave me alone!
How could you let her see me in my underwear?
Mom, this has gone too far.
You have to do something.
It's not supposed to be like this.
We're not supposed to injure my friends.
We're not supposed to let people see me in my underpants.
We're supposed to be there for each other.
Like when a family member dies, and we're supposed to go to their funeral?
I'll be in my room.
Then she slid into the trash and ran off.
I swear, this whole family is falling apart.
Yes!
I knew this moment would come.
They don't have their scapegoat around so everything goes to hell.
No one realized that I'm the one who held this family together.
Without me to blame everything on they don't know what to do with themselves.
A scapegoat thanks.
Mom thinks He's right.
This family needs a scapegoat.
I started this, so I should be the one to end it.
I did a terrible thing today.
I tore this family apart and I'm really sorry for that but it's not half as bad as what Reese did!
Oh, my God!
Was this Dewey's present?
Dewey: Present?
Lois: Reese, how could you?
Do you know how expensive this was?
Hal?
I'm on it.
That was a terrible thing to do to your little brother.
He was going to bury it with Aunt Helen.
You were going to make Aunt Helen spend eternity with a crushed Mighty Man?
M-Mighty Man?
I can't believe you.
This is a whole new low, Reese.
First of all, this is all circumstantial.
I don't know how that thing got in my backpack.
As for this Aunt Helen business, no one knows what I would've done at that funeral because we're not going.
Who says we're not going?
You did.
Well, you can guess again.
You are going to march right up to that coffin and apologize to that poor, dead woman.
We all are.
All right, everyone in the car as is.
We'll have to drive creatively, but we might make the end.
Let's go.
Chop, chop, here we go!
Egg!
Come on!
Aunt Helen used to say : ''Oh, you're going to miss me when I'm gone.
'' And, uh, by the looks of today's turnout I could see it wasn't just an idle threat.
: Yeah, Francis, your father's giving a speech and it's actually kind of good.
Can I get my phone back?
I'm almost done, sweetie.
Oh, Aunt Helen looks just lovely.
You turn right back around, mister!
You'll never guess what Reese did.
Well, it's been a pretty productive day.
I madeJulie Rulerman hate me.
Reese is going to kill me the second we get home and right now Aunt Helen is personally bad-mouthing me to God.
You want some more water, Uncle Louie?
Sure.
I need someone to put in a good word for me.

Malcolm, I think you should say something to your classmates.
They stayed inside while you were out playing ball with your friends.
Thanks.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
I don't know why Mom makes me get up at 8:00.
School doesn't even start till 8:1 5.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
You look different.
- I took a shower.
- I knew it!
on the state-legislature- sponsored initiative limiting the cabinet's attitude of overanalyzing past and current positions this type of governmental interference In international news, boring, boring, boring.
I'm incredibly boring.
Do you know who's boring?
Me.
Boring, goring, zoring, loring, doring, noring, foring.
Why haven't you changed the channel yet?
What?
I took a shower.
Is that a crime?
Is this going to be a daily thing?
Because we got a schedule Honey, let me handle this.
Son, are you on drugs?
No, it's just Why doesn't everyone just leave me alone?
!
Wow, usually we don't get someone storming off from the table until after pancakes.
Hey, kids, it's a new, improved Sleepy-Time Herbie now with super-sleepy fuzzy fur.
I'm sleepy.
Herbie's not available in stores.
Order yours now through this special Hi, Dewey.
I can make you happy.
I can make your brothers be nice to you.
I can get you out of school.
Your parents want to buy me for you.
All you got to do is ask them.
They're right there in the kitchen.
Why don't you go ask them?
Go on.
Yeah.
Go ask them.
- Can you buy me a Herbie?
- No, they're too expensive.
Maybe.
Ask me again in four seconds.
Can you buy me a Herbie, please?
Didn't you just hear me?
I said no.
Ask louder.
Son, what were you thinking?
!
Stealing 200 frogs from the biology lab and setting them loose on the highway!
I was freeing the alleged frogs, sir.
Killing live animals in the name of science is inhumane.
No!
Inhumane is sitting in a car for two and a half hours when I live only eight blocks from campus.
Sir, I didn't mean I am tired of all the things you didn't mean to do.
You didn't mean to come in four hours after curfew.
You didn't mean to replace the morning reveille record with a selection from trip-hop wizard Tricky.
Maybe I should just rename this ''Francis' 'I didn't mean to' file.
'' That would be a bold choice, sir.
Glibness.
What a surprise.
I'm giving you exactly ten seconds to tell me why I shouldn't put you on latrine detail for the rest of this semester.
Okay.
Um, why shouldn't I have to clean toilets for the next three months?
It's an intriguing question.
- Is that a new tie, sir?
- Four seconds.
What a beautiful beach.
Did you take this, sir?
You've truly captured your young male friend's Speedo.
That is a picture of me.
Now if I were you, I wouldn't try to distract me and Sir?
Sir?
Hmm?
That'll be all, cadet.
Were you crying?
- No, I was reading.
- You don't read.
Just shut the door, Krelboyne.
I'm still in here, perv.
Ha!
You're crying.
Oh, man.
You're crying.
You don't want to talk about it, do you?
It's about a girl.
I should've just walked away.
Wendy Finnerman-- she hates me.
I don't know what to do.
I tried everything to make her like me.
I'm toilet-papering her house tonight.
If that doesn't work, I'm out of ideas.
Look, Reese, maybe I can help you.
- What am I supposed to do?
- I don't know.
Just try anything that doesn't make her cry.
I guess you can start off by finding out stuff about her.
You know, do the things she likes to do.
Is that before or after I go TP her house?
- Instead.
- All right.
I'll try it your way.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
I know I'm going to pay for this, but Reese loves Wendy!
Reese loves Wendy!
Ha, ha.
Go, Wildcats, go.
Go, Wildcats, go, go.
Go, Wildcats, go, go.
Go, Wildcats, go, go.
That's it.
Reese!
Why are you dressed like that?
I figured out what she likes.
I saw her cheering for the football team, so I joined the cheerleading squad.
Why didn't you join the football team, doofus?
She's a cheerleader.
Reese, you're a guy.
Guy cheerleaders are the lowest of the low.
Worse than band, worse than Krelboynes.
The only thing lower is that guy that never takes his hand out of his butt.
Oh, Chester?
He's a cheerleader too.
Does a lot of solo work.
I tried to help him.
I gave him advice.
I tried reasoning with him.
There's only one thing left to do-- sit back and laugh my ass off.
Good luck.
Come in, cadet.
Look, sir I have the floor.
In the short time that you have been under my care we have had our share of conflicts.
In all my efforts to get through to you I have tried every method I know how.
And besides mental and physical abuse, sir, exactly which methods would those be?
This photo made me realize something.
I used to be like you.
Insolent, arrogant, cavalier.
- Sir, I - Floor.
Now, son, you are on the precipice.
Now, I am going to tell you a story about my life in the hopes of finally getting you to straighten yourself out.
In the coming hours, you are going to hear things that are going to horrify you.
It sounds illuminating, sir, but I have biology.
I've taken the liberty of canceling your next three classes.
Son, do you know what a wet nurse is?
Dewey, have you forgotten me?
I thought we were friends.
All of the boys and girls on your street are my friends.
They all bought me.
Your parents have lots of money.
They're just hiding it.
But I don't want you to buy me for me.
It's for your own good.
I didn't want to tell you this, but if you don't buy me, you'll die.
Honestly, Hal, I don't know what's wrong with Reese.
Oh, he's just a little slow.
No.
I mean the way he's been acting.
Hey, Mom, where's the iron?
Ah.
- It's a girl.
- It's a girl.
Hal, it's time for the talk.
I don't know what you mean.
The talk, Hal.
Oh, geez, he's a little young, don't you think?
You waited so long with Francis; look what happened there.
All right, but if I'm giving the talk, all three boys are getting it at the same time.
And I'm not doing it again.
So if we have any more kids, they're on their own.
Mom?
Dad?
I'd really like a Herbie doll.
I know it's expensive, but I don't ask for a lot.
And I've been very good lately.
I want it!
I want it!
I want it!
I want it!
I want it!
I want it!
I want it!
Looks like he found the sugar.
Oh, doesn't he look just like a little dust mop?
Ready?
Hit it.
B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E!
B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E!
What's that spell?
Be aggressive!
B-E aggressive!
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y.
That's the Wildcats' battle cry.
What a geek.
I never thought I'd get to say that.
Oh, my God.
I'm a Krelboyne with a brother who's a cheerleader.
I can wet my pants in public and it would be a lateral move.
O-R-Y.
That's the Wildcats' battle cry.
Success!
Victory success!
Victory, yes!
Ow!
So clumsy.
Hey, Malcolm.
You think your brother will lend me his corset?
When a Krelboyne makes fun of you, you know you're in trouble.
See, that comment was playing off the concept that we all have specific notions of gender-appropriate roles.
At least they're no good at it.
So there we were-- the ocean, my stepfather and me.
As the storm raged overhead, he made one final lunge for the rudder.
I ripped it from his hands and stared him down.
He knew that I was prepared to kill him.
I left port that day a 1 6-year-old boy.
I returned a man.
That was an amazing story, sir.
I mean, I was skeptical at first, but we do have something in common.
I mean, look at the way both our mothers abandoned us.
What are you talking about?
You know, how I was shipped off here and you were left with your wet nurse.
That story had nothing to do with my mother.
It had to do with me finally taking responsibility for my own actions.
Just sounded like she may have been a little bit distant.
Well, that is none of your business.
I swear, you are absolutely fixated on mothers.
I am not fixated.
Can you name one thing in your life that you don't blame on your mother?
Sure.
I'm sorry.
I was just giving an opinion.
Well, it's that pop psychology nonsense that It is nothing to get defensive about.
I am not defensive.
Every time anybody denies a lie, they're called defensive.
Fine.
I take it back.
Your mother was a saint.
I am not saying that at all.
Does this look anything like a ''Q''?
Reese,just stop this.
You're acting like a moron.
And you're making no progress with Wendy.
And what the hell do you need a ''Q'' for anyway?
You're right.
I'm terrible.
I'm just not coordinated unless I'm hitting somebody.
But I really like her.
I have to get good.
Listen to the words.
Good.
Boy.
Cheerleader.
-Quit while you still have some dignity.
-Oh, and let her think I'm a quitter?
You can't even remember a simple six-step routine.
There's six steps?
Yes.
It's just right, left, right, left, reverse, pose.
You remember that from just watching?
You guys did it, like, ten times.
So you know my routine?
It's not that hard.
- But you know my routine.
- Yes, I do.
Look, I know where this is going No, you don't.
You're going to help me.
- That is where I was going.
- Oh.
Good.
Let's get started.
- No!
- Come on!
You have to!
No.
Don't you know how embarrassing that could be for me?
- I know what's more embarrassing.
- What?
Getting beaten into a coma by a good boy cheerleader.
Spangler: My mother was neither a madonna or a whore!
She was a damn fine woman.
Stick your arms out!
We have to sell this!
Can you move your hand a little to the left?
Reese: Spread your legs!
Malcolm: No!
Reese: I said spread your legs!
Malcolm: No!
It's time for the talk, Hal.
Malcolm: I'm not spreading my legs!
Fight, fight, fight!
Fight harder, Wildcats!
Help us out!
Fight!
Fight, fight, fight!
Fight harder, Wildcats!
Help us out!
Fight!
We got spirit!
Wildcats, we got spirit!
Wildcats, we got what?
What, what, what, what?
What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
We got spirit!
Wildcats, we got spirit!
Wildcats, we got what?
What, what, what, what?
What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
We got spirit!
Whoo!
Yes!
Yes.
Reese, that was incredible.
Who's been helping you on your spirit kicks?
Come on, Reese, I really have to go!
I'm the most worthless, putrid loser in the world.
Everybody hates me.
I hate me.
- Your brother in there?
- Where else?
Reese?
Come on out.
We need to have a talk.
- Finally.
- Malcolm, you're in on this talk too.
- Me?
!
Why do I have to be here?
- Relax.
It's going to be far worse for me than it is for you.
Boys, this talk is very important, so I need your undivided attention.
It's very important that you be bored and squirm a lot.
Now, I want to tell you about what happens when a boy really, really likes a girl.
And Dewey, I'll try to make this easy for you to understand.
Ah.
Aw, man, I still play with that.
Here we go.
There's a certain thing that happens between normal, healthy people.
It's called chemistry.
Well, that doesn't happen, except maybe the first time.
What does happen is this: I like you.
: I like you, too.
And if they love each other and take the proper precautions, they'll have sex.
- But I've told you about that already.
- Not me.
Well ask your brothers.
Now, unfortunately, if the boy is from our family it goes a little more like this: - I like you.
- I hate you!
Now I love you!
Leave me alone!
Your insane neediness is driving me away!
Look at me!
Look at me!
Look, oh, I'm crazy!
Lookit!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Pay attention to me!
Look at me!
Look at me!
I'm crazy!
I'm an idiot!
I'm an idiot!
Watch me crash and burn!
There's no explaining it.
It's hereditary, and it goes back for generations.
Francis has it; so does Uncle Pete.
It's why your great grandpa went to work on that oil rig in Peru.
All I know is your mother must carry some sort of internal antidote, because, through some fluke, I was lucky enough to get her.
I just wanted you boys to know what you were in for.
There was so much I wanted to tell her, but she was gone and I I Come on, sir.
Just say it.
I hated her!
All these issues with my mother.
I know now that this was not an accident.
Talking with you has helped me work out some things with my own family.
I mean, all those years I blamed my parents for every senseless act of self-destruction.
And all this time I was at least partially responsible for a couple of them.
It really means a lot to me to know that I can come to you when I need to talk.
Familiarity breeds contempt, cadet.
- What are you doing?
- What's the point?
You heard Dad.
I'm doomed!
You can't quit!
I've worked too hard for you to quit!
I hate to inform you, brain boy, it's not about you, it's about me.
That's before I spent an entire day with your hand on my ass!
You owe me!
- I can't help you.
- Yes, you can!
You can break the cycle Dad was talking about!
- You have to talk to Wendy!
- I can't!
I freeze up!
Do you want to end up like Francis or Uncle Pete?
I don't care anymore!
Anything's better than this!
Even marrying Mom?
Dewey, your mother and I want to talk to you.
You're a good boy.
But in life being good doesn't always get you the things that you want.
What I'm trying to say is that when your mother and I don't buy you a toy, it doesn't mean that we don't love you.
Hmm?
You have to learn that disappointment is all part of being a grown-up.
But, luckily you're not a grown-up yet!
- Ta-da!
- Wow!
Oh, come on, how cute is that?
- Break me.
- Okay.
Girl: Okay, set in a row.
Ready?
Here we go.
Wendy?
Did you say something?
Wendy, I really like you.
Like when a boy likes a girl-- normal and healthy?
I'm sorry for hurting you all those times.
I'm really not a bad guy.
Anyways thanks.
I like you, too.
Really?
Yeah.
I even kind of liked your bad boy side, too.
-  -  Oh, my God!
Call nine one  Hello, Mother?
It's Edwin.
Yes, it has been a long time.
So be sure to try the new and improved Chip-A-Roo cookie today.
I can make you taller, I can make you better-looking.
If you eat enough of me, I can make you president, maybe even emperor of the world.
Honey, can you buy me a box of these cookies?
Make it two.
Make it two boxes.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
This isn't fair.
Yes, it is.
It's absolutely fair.
I'm getting hungry.
We're doing it my way.
They're getting cold.
Do you want 'em divided up fairly or not?
- You have more than me.
- No, I don't.
We all have 29 inches of fries so far.
I have two four-inchers, five three-inchers and three two-inchers.
You have five five-inchers and a four-incher.
- They're exactly the same.
- Dewey.
Okay, we're going to assume this was a four-incher from the share pile.
times 29 divided by three minus We each take a two-inch bite out of this one.
Last week we had curly fries.
It took us three hours.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Good job, Don!
Oh, man!
- He's wide open!
- Shoot!
Shoot!
There it is!
In your face.
I got it, I got it!
Car!
Good game.
This sucks.
You mocking me?
No tired.
Get skates.
Can't.
Dad.
My dad was some kind of skating champion a long time ago.
He made a rule-- no one in the family could buy skates until after they take lessons from him.
So take the lessons.
You don't get it.
My dad's like a total fanatic about skating.
He doesn't even call it skating.
He calls it ''the brotherhood of the wheel.
'' He taught Francis and Reese and they've never been the same after.
Gretzky shoots!
He scores!
He laughs at the other Canadians!
Hey, Reese, remember when Dad taught you how to skate?
I don't want to talk about it.
Why can't you just tell me what it was like?
One, I'm not supposed to, and two, I don't even like to think about it.
It makes me cry.
Hey, hey, hey!
What's wrong with you?
You know you're not supposed to skate in the house.
Everyone else in the world gets to.
Wait a minute.
Somebody stepped in something.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
What a mess!
Reese what did you roll in?
Oh, man.
You have to admit, it is kind of funny-- yelling so loud you actually throw out your back.
Just try to relax.
Got the baby monitor all set up here.
Now, if you need anything, just holler-- but not too loud-- and I will get on it.
Oh, God.
Sorry.
Oh, God.
Why don't you just take the pain medicine the doctor gave you?
Because they make me loopy.
I will not have this house come crashing down around me because I'm hopped up on goofballs.
Mom, I'm really sorry.
Are you okay?
Oh, Reese, come to Mama.
Closer, sweetheart.
Are you happy you crippled your mother?
Mom Are you?
Mom.
Mom Survival weekend?
What does that mean?
That means we get to spend two whole days out in the wilderness with limited supplies and no food.
- You're kidding, right?
- No.
It's a excellent way to learn basic survival techniques.
It's two days in the woods.
Our parents are paying for room and board.
Where does that money go?
Sounds like a big scam.
- Maybe so, but you're doing it.
- What?
Francis, I let you blow off a lot of things around here but this is something I believe in.
It's a character builder.
I think it'll be good for you.
How could it be good for me?
No food, no shelter.
No broken clavicles.
That's something inside me, right?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Get a glass.
Don't you dare!
When I get well, I am going to beat you blue, mister!
Get a glass!
All right.
Okay.
Can I have some milk?
Yes, but get a glass.
Okay.
Hello, Francis.
I have a problem.
I need your advice.
Trust me, whatever you're going through is not half as bad as what I'm facing.
I'm thinking of asking Dad for skating lessons.
Why does everyone do that?
What does he do?
Look, if I told you, you'd just freak out.
But if you think you're ready, my advice is to get it over with quickly.
It's like pulling a giant Band-Aid off your crotch.
I'm going to have a Band-Aid on my crotch?
- Who are you talking to?
- Francis.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Mom.
Oh, I am in such pain because of my back.
The doctor says I have to stay in bed for three days Mom with my leg on a pillow and then put ice on it.
Look, Mom.
Have you ever heard of such a thing?
I never heard of such a thing.
That doesn't make any sense to me.
Oh, thanks, honey.
Here you go.
- One more thing.
- Yeah?
Stop trying to drug my food.
Where was I?
Francis?
W-Where?
- Your back.
- Oh, yeah.
So they say that my fourth and fifth vertebrae are out of alignment.
Apparently my shoulder muscles are asymmetrical.
Did you ever hear of such a thing?
They say it's genetic.
It's the first case of scream-induced back trauma they've ever seen.
They paraded every Tom, Dick and Harry through that room to look at me.
I'm lying there with that little flimsy paper thing on me with my rear end flapping in the breeze for all the world to see.
Boys, they're called Gut-Busters.
They take a sausage, stuff it with cheese, wrap it with bacon and shove it in that deep-fat fryer full of lard.
They're indescribable.
Bon appÃ©tit.
Malcolm, where have you been?
You got to get in on this.
Dad I want skating lessons.
Son, do you know, once you start there's no going back?
I know.
This means total commitment.
Once you begin the path, there is no leaving the path.
Are you sure you're ready for that?
I mean really ready?
I-I guess so.
Neat.
We'll start tomorrow.
Come on, dig in before they harden.
Let's do it.
Stretch.
Nose to knees, nose to knees, and release.
Ooh.
- You feeling a little limber now?
- Mostly I feel sleepy.
Well, we have to start early.
We've got a lot of ground to cover.
Rule number one: you can't question my ways.
I'm the top skate-dog.
Understood?
You may not like my methods but let me just show you what you can accomplish if you stick with it.
Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me Town to keep me movin' keep me groovin' with some energy Well, I talk about it, talk about it talk about it, talk about it Talk about, talk about talk about movin' Should I be impressed or horrified?
Dad, that was unbelievable.
Whew!
That routine won me a gold medal, a macrame plant hanger and your mother's heart all in the same afternoon.
Want to see your skates?
Yeah.
Come on.
I prefer a Saratoga four-wide but I know you kids like that in-line stuff.
So Whoa!
They're beautiful!
They are, aren't they?
Wait, I don't get to wear them?
Oh, no you're not ready for those just yet.
That's just your incentive.
One step at a time, Malcolm.
Roll to the goal.
Huh?
You're going to start with these.
- Why do I have to - Ah-ah-ah.
Top skate-dog.
Now, let's see you skate through those cones.
I don't have skates.
Your skates are in here.
Go on.
- ?
?
- Glide and glide Let your arms work with-- Slow down.
Slower.
Slower.
This is going to rule.
All I'm taking is a canteen a knife, my bedroll and some emergency rations.
Wuss.
Canteen, knife, survival blanket.
That's all?
Dude, hard-core.
Let's rock.
You ready?
Ready as I'll ever be.
What is it?
My back.
I can't move.
It happens sometimes.
It's genetic.
My shoulder muscles are asymmetrical and it pulls my vertebrae out of alignment.
I'll be fine.
I just need to ice it.
Which vertebrae?
Fourth and fifth.
All right.
Take him to his room.
Hands out front so you get a balance.
Hold it Hold it.
Why am I doing this?
Stop clouding your mind.
This is a process.
Dad, it's street hockey, not clown school.
Process And one and down and over.
- When am I ever going to use this?
- Full range of motion.
And point and bump, and point and bump and point and bump, and then we glide.
How about my skates?
Can I at least try on my skates?
Absolutely not.
You need at least two more days.
- Two days?
- Uh-huh.
I know enough to play a stupid game of street hockey now.
That's all I care about.
Malcolm, we go at the speed I say.
This is about safety and proper technique.
But it doesn't make any sense.
That's because you're not in a skating state of mind.
Now, that's it.
Okay?
We're done.
Go home.
You know what?
Thanks to your attitude we are now a day behind.
Fine!
The boy's fighting me, Lois.
Oh, he's got the talent, but he's reckless and wild.
- Fine.
I'll talk to him.
- That's not what I'm asking.
Well, that's what going to ha--  Would you just take the darn pill dear?
I can't believe he cut me off.
You questioned his ways.
Never question his ways.
That just makes it take even longer.
You going to go play hockey?
I'll see you out there in a month or two.
I don't know how yet, but there's definitely a way I can justify this.
Malcolm!
Dang, I thought I'd at least get a few minutes in before he busted me.
You know what?
Screw it.
I'm sick of this.
- What do you think you're doing?
- Taking my skates to go play hockey.
Absolutely not; we had an agreement.
Agreement?
You just like bossing me around!
And you like fighting me every step of the way!
Because you're treating me like a baby!
The stuff you're teaching me is stupid.
Okay, that's it.
You just lost these, pal.
Oh, yeah?
Well    you.
You heard me.
Woman: Modeling isn't all glamour.
Sometimes you have to act like it's hot when it's really cold.
People don't realize how hard we work I am the only one who truly understands you, Inga.
I cannot believe you said that to Dad.
Oh, and if you pass Francis on your way to Siberia, tell him I said hi.
Do you think he told Mom?
I wouldn't worry about that.
Mom's feeling a lot better.
Dr. Reese paid her a little visit.
What are you talking about?
Let's just say, pills and sandwich-- not effective; pills and milk-- effective.
I just don't get it.
I mean, I have always been the good parent.
That's true - I'm the nice one.
- Yeah, that's true.
You're the bad one.
The system can't work with two bad cops.
Oh, I hate cops.
Cops, eh You know what else I hate?
Those what-do-you-call-thems?
Those - I wasn't ready for this from Malcolm.
- Those soap salesmen.
Not yet.
But he stepped over the line, and I don't think there's any way back.
I mean, it's not as if I caught him with a cigarette and can make him smoke a whole carton.
You know what?
I hate bigots too.
Oh, I hate bigots.
Malcolm has always been different.
God, why can't he be like his brothers?
Reese took a swing at me; Francis took a swing at me-- that I can deal with.
Block, chop, they're on the ground gasping for air.
It's over with.
But this is like words.
I mean, you know what I hate most of all?
I hate those gigantic pink Oh, thank God.
I've paid my dues Time after time And bad mistakes I've made a few I've had my share of sand kicked in my face But I've come through And we mean to go on and on and on and on We are the champions My friends And we'll keep on fighting Till the end We are the champions We are the champions Smokin'!
No time for losers 'Cause we are the champions  Uh, Houston, we are good to go.
Uh, Roger that.
You are good to go in five, four, three, two, one.
Go!
Whoo!
Hey fellas!
Boy, has it been two days already?
How was it, huh?
You just missed the big fire.
But, um, luckily I was here to put it out.
Can I offer you some cookie dough?
Come on, guys, let's be reasonable.
I can't spend two days in the woods tied to a chair.
Three days-- one extra for lying.
Well, at least lend me a jacket!
Or some food!
Dudes, come on!
You can't leave me out here with nothing!
That was to me, not at me, right?
- Hal.
-  - Honey, what are you doing up?
- Don't you ''honey'' me.
You slipped me drugs.
Oh!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself getting Reese to sandbag me like that.
''Would you like some milk, Mother?
'' The kid's never brought me one thing in his entire life.
And don't think I can't smell those Gut-Busters coming out of your pores.
You are back on rice cakes, mister, starting now!
Boys, your mother's mobile.
Malcolm, I need to see you in the backyard.
Now, you said what you said, and we can't change that.
And it isn't the kind of thing that could be solved with an apology or a simple punishment.
But we do need to find a way to get past this.
Agreed?
I guess so.
Good.
Now, here's how I see it: this whole thing stems from you feeling like I treat you like a child.
So What's this?
That is ten pages, single-spaced, of filthy name-calling.
What?
They get worse as they go along.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Well, since you think you're old enough to use these kind of words I think you're old enough to see the effect they have.
Malcolm, you are going to look me in the eye and say every last one of these terrible things to the man who held you in his arms the moment you were born.
- But, Dad - Uh-uh.
I'm not your dad.
I'm, uh here  A stinkin' son of a To my face.
Continue.
I can't.
You see, son?
Words hurt.
That's why you have to use them carefully.
I understand, Dad.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I think you've had enough.
No, wait.
I can make it through the whole list.
I'm not going to let you down again.
hole.
Good.
Very thorough.
Dad, will you please finish teaching me how to skate?
Of course.
But let's not make eye contact for a couple weeks.
You got it.
- Oh, man.
- Mine!
Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me Town to keep me movin' keep me groovin' with some energy Well, I talk about it, talk about it talk about it, talk about it Talk about, talk about talk about movin' Go, Malcolm!
Gotta move on Gotta move on Gotta move on I know I look like an idiot, but I'm kickin' ass!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
I got one!
I got one!
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Malcolm: Okay, give me the tape.
What if we get caught?
Don't worry about it.
No one's home.
I cued it up to the best part.
It's Battle Bots!
And it's a free-for-all at the battle arena.
I thought this was porno.
Ew!
No.
This is better.
And no one's excluded.
Come on, this is the lamest thing I've Oh, my God!
Is that real?
It's an open competition.
People build killer robots put them in a ring and see which one comes out alive.
Killer robots?
!
I can't believe it.
Finally something cool about being smart.
I wish we could do that.
We were hoping you'd say that.
Here's the deal: We want to enter the competition.
We've got the designs, we've got the desire and we're not distracted by any kind of social life.
The only problem is that our parents would never allow us to build something that dangerous.
That means we need a place with a total lack of caring adult supervision.
That's my house!
But those things look really expensive.
No problem.
My father tries to buy my love.
All: Oh, yeah!
Who's your daddy?
What are the odds, huh of Francis having an emergency appendectomy two months after using the same excuse to ditch school?
Well, he was never very lucky.
Oh, I need you to call work and tell them I won't be coming in.
Will do.
Well, there's my cab.
What's that all about?
A little something to remember me by.
You know, it just occurred to me that we have not been apart for one night in 1 8 years.
You going to be okay with that?
: I think I can manage without my mommy for a few days.
I told you that baby voice creeps me out.
Sorry.
Well, Cadet I see you survived.
Yes, sir.
I brought you a little something to take your mind off the pain.
This is a good opportunity for you to catch up on your homework.
Take it from me-- a lengthy hospital stay is the perfect environment to focus your mind and attack weaknesses in your character.
If it hadn't been for this I never would've learned conversational French.
Carry on.
Sorry, man.
I was this close to going medieval on him.
You feeling okay?
I feel like I have a belly full of broken glass.
Every time I breathe in, I almost pass out from the pain.
This is the single greatest thing that has ever happened to me.
What?
For as long as I can remember my mom has been torturing me with guilt.
I've never been able to fight back but this is perfect!
Her firstborn child almost dies and she's the one who sent me here.
She can't dismiss it, she can't argue about it she can't twist it around and make it my fault.
It's beautiful!
-  - Dude you almost died.
I want you to say that again when she gets here.
Oh, this poor woman has no idea what she's walking into.
Okay, Mom's only going to be gone for about four or five days, so we have to prioritize.
What are you asking Dad for?
I want to wear my pajamas to school.
I'm getting a scope for my BB gun.
You don't have a BB gun.
Not yet.
Okay.
But since I'm asking to build a killer robot I should go first.
Why?
Because anything after ''killer robot'' is going to sound reasonable.
Dad?
Yeah.
A couple friends and I want to explore our engineering and machining skills Sounds great.
So, um you think it'd be all right if a bunch of Krelboynes and I build a robot in the house?
Yeah, fine.
Whoa, that was easy, even for him!
For crying out loud.
Be strong.
Lois will get through her operation.
She is a fighter.
No, no, Craig.
It was Francis.
Oh, my God!
Did he shoot her?
I knew it!
I told her to stay away from him!
That boy has been nothing but trouble.
Now, Craig, uh Lois did not have an operation.
Our son Francis did.
She just went down to Alabama to look after him for awhile.
Oh.
Well, tell Lois I stopped by.
I can't believe my mom missed them putting my catheter in.
Maybe I should take it out so they can reinsert it when she gets here.
Maybe you could-- I don't know-- shut up about your mom for half a second.
No one's that bad.
Hey, I've been sugar-coating it for you 'cause you're enfeebled.
Lois: Francis!
But you can just see for yourself.
Hi, honey.
You look terrible!
: You think that's going to appease your guilt?
What guilt?
Boy, it's stuffy in here.
That can't be good for you.
Have you had a bowel movement?
When is the last time you moved your bowels?
Mom Hello!
Who are you?
Edwin Spangler.
I am commandant of Marlin Academy.
Good for you.
Where's your eye?
Pardon?
Do your ears work?
Do you have some business with my son?
He needs to rest.
Well, I stopped by to pick up your boy's homework.
Homework?
!
You're not giving him homework.
My son nearly lost his life-- something that never would've happened if you'd taken proper care of him in the first place.
Well, I assure you, ma'am had it not been for Francis' long history of crying wolf Crying wolf?
You listen to me, you idiot!
My child is sick.
He does not need you marching in here, puffing up your chest and making his life more miserable than it already is.
Why don't you just go play army man somewhere else?
God, she is magnificent.
Dude, your mom rocks.
Mmm.
You got a girl?
Yeah, Sarge.
I miss her somethin'awful.
As soon as I get home, I'm gonna marry her.
We need more torque!
No, we need a balance between speed and torque.
This is great.
I can make a huge mess, build a killer robot and Mom's not here to yell at us.
I don't even mind having Krelboynes in the house.
Do we all want a direct, continuous linear relation between the rotary actuator and the robot's translational displacement or am I just some kind of crazy dreamer?
Well, what about my design for - the polycarbonate body?
- It's a butterfly!
Correction-- killer butterfly.
Beautiful yet deadly.
The perfect killing machine.
It's too unreliable.
It's got to be more simple, like a sledgehammer A superheated spike shot out by power charges.
That won't be easy What's this stuff?
We were just sort of fooling around with some ideas.
Let's have a look.
Well I'd go with the flame thrower.
That would destroy everything within a ten-foot perimeter.
Of course, there's a lot to be said for that high-voltage probe.
Sir, before you continue, I feel I have to mention that our parents strongly disapprove of this.
Sorry, my therapist says it's a compulsion.
Well, I guess you shouldn't tell your parents, then.
Wow.
Your father's lack of responsibility is both terrifying and oddly thrilling.
I can't apologize enough for these barbaric accommodations.
You deserve so much more.
Oh, no, this is fine.
Why are all the hotel rooms booked?
The All-Alabama Gay Rodeo is in town again.
Homosexuals riding horses and such.
It does wonders for the local economy but you have to fight the crowds for everything.
If you're interested, I have some passes.
No, thanks.
Another time, then.
Bon soir.
You know, this room isn't so bad.
The way you whined about it I thought it was going to be a couple of cots and a drain in the floor.
What are you doing?
You're stinky.
I'm giving you a sponge bath.
You're not giving me a sponge bath.
Arms up.
Just because you had surgery is no reason to be a pig.
Mom, did you know that I almost died?
Oh, you did not almost die.
My appendix burst!
They had to vacuum out the contents of my intestines.
You could not possibly comprehend the pain that I was in-- that I am in.
Yeah.
I don't know anything about pain-- what, with four boys totaling 1 1 2 hours of labor you being half of that, I might add.
I'm sorry that I came out feet first, Mom.
That's okay, honey.
I forgave you years ago.
Oh, God, that tattoo.
I like the tattoo, Mom.
What is it with the men in this family and tattoos?
It took me five years to get your father to burn his off.
What, are you growing potatoes in there?
Dad had a tattoo?
Yeah, he put a great big '' Lois'' right across his rear end.
Actually thought I'd be flattered by it.
That guy was such a mess when I met him.
Between the motorcycle and the drinking and the fighting-- He was so reckless, it was crazy.
Where do you think you boys get it from?
That doesn't sound like Dad.
Yeah, well, that was a long time ago.
Your father has been quite a project.
I spent years hounding him and scolding him and constantly watching him But finally I got all that rebellion right out of him.
I can't believe Dad had a wild side.
Well, someday, you're going to meet a nice girl.
She's going to do the same thing for you.
Do your lowers.
Dad?
Oh, hey, son.
What are you doing?
I just thought I'd help you kids out with your robot.
You know, it's amazing how much you can get accomplished when you don't sleep at all.
I think we got a little something up our sleeve for the competition.
Dad?
I know, it's still a little slow.
But wait till I put on the big blade.
Well, we just finished the 45th and final video of the Shao-Lin Dragon series.
We are now officially desensitized to violence.
How many sodas have you had?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
Look, I can write on my tongue.
We can start in on Monks of Death or lighten things up with a little Samurai Bloodfest.
We've had a vote.
We're backing out of the contest.
- What?
- Your father has commandeered this project and twisted it toward his own mad ends.
We want our blueprints back.
We can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard Come on, my dad's in the backyard.
Way.
Dad?
Hey, boys.
The guys want their-- Are you smoking?
Oh, this?
No, I'm just just playing around.
Listen, don't tell your mom, okay?
She'd kill me if she found out.
She worked so hard to get me to stop.
Oh, God, how I miss that woman.
Um, the guys want their blueprints back.
Oh, yeah, they're over there.
I've gone way past that.
Hey, picture this.
A laser-guided bee cannon.
Bees shot out with the precision of a laser.
How would that hurt a robot?
Oh, come on, think.
It's not for the robot.
It's for the guy controlling the robot.
Buzz, zap!
You're going home with a plaque or ribbon or whatever crappy award they give you for winning.
This will end badly.
Hal: There we go.
I hear you, old fella!
You're not alone.
Come on, come on, do it for Mama.
Come on, go!
Come on, you're just letting me win, aren't you?
I'm really not.
I know, I'm just rubbing it in.
Rubbing it in!
Your mom is great.
This isn't my mom.
It's an act.
It's some kind of freaky mind game she's playing with me.
Any second now her face is going to split open and she's going to reveal herself for the evil banshee she really is.
Man, I don't know why she puts up with you.
Anyone for doubles?
Nope.
All right, then.
Oh, hi, honey.
Where you been?
I want you to leave.
What?
I want you to leave.
You made your phony point.
You made me look like an idiot.
Mission accomplished.
You know what?
I have had it with you, mister.
You have done nothing but bitch and moan since I got here and I've been nothing but pleasant.
Exactly!
You complain when I'm pleasant and when I'm not?
There's no winning with you.
Why don't you just tell me exactly how you want me to behave and we'll see if that satisfies you.
This isn't fair.
You're taking my pain and you're twisting it into your guilt trip.
Fine.
Why don't I just leave then?
Fine.
Fine.
Mom being gone was fun at first but this is getting out of control.
Please be Mom.
Please be Mom.
Please be Mom.
Hello?
Hello!
: Oh.
Hi, Mr.Jackson.
Well, yes I do have a very good reason for not going in to work today.
Well, how about this?
I didn't come to work because somehow I felt that eight hours of joyless, mind-numbing crap just didn't seem like fun.
I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree.
I thought your flight wasn't until 1 1 :00.
It isn't.
So you have some extra time.
You want to do something?
We're in the middle of Alabama.
What is there to do?
Gay rodeo's in town.
That could be interesting.
Well, if that's what you want to do.
Look, it isn't really what I want to do.
I'm trying to be pleasant.
We'll go.
Please be Mom.
Craig.
Just brought by your mom's paycheck.
Tell her I'm the one that brought it by.
Wait.
We need your help.
My dad's going crazy.
He hasn't slept in four days.
He's smoking, he's dancing around in his underwear.
He's ripping phones out of the walls.
You've got to stop him.
Don't worry, son.
I'll handle this.
What are you doing?
You don't expect me to tackle something like this on an empty stomach?
Hey, buddy.
Well, well.
What do we have here?
The boy here says you could use some company.
I got my sons, we're bonding.
What the hell is that thing?
That thing is a little project we have been working on around here.
A secret, deadly project.
Hal why don't you turn off the machine and sit down?
Why don't you stop telling me what to do?
Why don't you sit down like I asked you to?
Look, fats I don't want you around my house anymore.
Hey, you don't go to the fat thing I won't go to the crazy thing.
Dad, cut it out!
It's not funny anymore!
Leave him alone!
- Say ''uncle''!
- No!
Just say it.
We can stop this right now with a little dignity if you just say it!
I won't say it!
One simple word.
Duncle.
Uh-uh, you said ''duncle.
'' Now you have to say ''uncle'' in my butt.
No!
Let me up!
Dad, you have to stop it!
You're right.
I've got better things to do.
Dad, what are you doing?
I think me and Lois number two here are going to go down to work and pay a little visit to Mr.Jackson's Lexus.
Dad, don't move.
What are you doing?
I'm stopping you from quitting your job by threatening you with a killer robot.
I wish this felt half as cool as it sounds.
Just turn it off, Malcolm.
Stop being crazy.
Just put the remote down.
You have no idea what this machine is capable of.
Why don't you just sit down?
And why don't you just put the remote down?
Dad, please.
Malcolm Why don't you both just shut up?
!
Run.
No kidding.
Run.
Oh, no.
: Call animal control.
You ripped the phone out of the wall.
Go to the neighbor.
They won't let us over anymore.
Do something.
Why don't we just all sit down and no one will do anything until Mom gets home?
Okay.
I got to say, as far as gay rodeos go this one's pretty entertaining.
Are you sure you're not embarrassed to be seen with your mother?
Nah.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
I picked this trick up in camp last year.
This is going to be great.
Wait for it.
Wait for it Oh, screw it.
Oh, man.
What's wrong, Reese?
Nothing!
Just-Just shut up and go to sleep, okay?
It's good to be alive.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
Hey, Dewey, wake up!
It's Monday morning.
Hooray!
I never thought I'd be happy about a Monday but today's the end of two months of being grounded.
Two months!
What are you doing?
Shut up.
I have to finish my homework.
Reese, we couldn't do anything all weekend.
No friends, no TV-- we did absolutely nothing and you still managed not to do your homework?
The point is, we never should've been grounded in the first place.
He is right.
Mom went way overboard.
We didn't even do anything that bad.
Okay, so if we give you Dewey's bike Circus will eat a wet dog food sandwich.
Right.
Sounds good.
Wait a minute.
I don't want you ripping off my little brothers.
You only get the bike if he eats the whole can.
Done.
You the man, Circus.
You the man.
This is worth it.
What you going to tell Mom?
The guy pushed him off took the bike and then just ran off.
How'd she know we were lying?
We were brilliant.
How's Mom?
She's got a temperature of 1 04.
I've never seen her this sick.
It's like some sort of horrible science experiment in there.
Mom's been sick with the flu all weekend.
I'd feel more sympathetic, but two months with no TV has killed the part of me that cares.
I finally figured out how Mom could tell we were lying.
How?
Pheromones.
She could smell the fear on us.
Next time you lie, you have to take a shower first.
Okay, boys I got to go to work but before I do, I want to talk to you.
Now, when I get home I get to plug this cord back into the TV.
So you boys have to behave.
You're not the only ones who've suffered with no TV.
For all I know, there's a new wrestling champion.
So I want you to get to school on time.
Before you leave, you go in there and tell your mother to feel better.
Maybe we should just let her sleep.
She slept straight through the last 48 hours.
I think it's okay to wake her up for five minutes.
Mom?
You're starting to look better.
He's not lying.
Mom kills most germs on contact but when one does get through, it's a doozy.
You kids remember you're not stepping foot out of this house today.
- Huh?
- No TV.
No friends till tomorrow.
But Mom This is the last Sunday of your punishment.
But  Okay, Mom, we got it.
We're still grounded.
What are you doing?
Mom slept all weekend.
She still thinks it's Sunday.
You know what this means?
No.
We can pretend today's Sunday and stay home from school.
Oh, I'm in.
Okay, Mom.
We're just going to go continue our punishment.
And we're definitely not going to school.
Shut up.
Beautiful, huh?
Just came in this week.
Just looking.
Please, take your time, take your time.
Enjoy yourself.
Wow I love this car.
Yeah.
Oh, I see you've added four ponies from last year.
We also put in the new skid control system.
Oh.
The new brochures came in.
I could show you one if you want.
No, I should get to work.
Sir, can I ask is your job really so important that you can't allow yourself five minutes of pleasure?
I have no response to that.
Yes!
All right!
This'll be great!
No, wait, we can't.
Someone will see us.
We're supposed to be in school.
Okay.
We'll just stay inside and watch T Oh, dang!
Just give me some time to think.
Come on, already, think of something!
I'm trying.
All I've got are all the reasons this was a stupid idea in the first place.
Even if we manage to keep mom fooled we're screwed when Dad gets home.
It basically means we're going to sit here, bored out of our minds for eight hours and wait for Mom to top our last punishment.
How could you be so stupid?
I could have done that myself.
get it before Mom wakes.
In A Deep Voice: Hello?
Look, Mom It's all lies.
I had nothing to do with it.
- Francis?
- It's Francis?
Let me talk.
Guys, stop it.
What are you doing home?
Mom's sick.
She thinks it's Sunday.
We kind of went with it.
Cool.
Oh, dude, I need you to do me a giant favor.
Go check the mail.
There should be a letter there from Southern Alabama State.
Yeah, it's here.
Why, did you apply there?
No, it's probably no point in me ever trying to.
I kind of drove a backhoe into their swimming pool.
Oh, man.
Did they have to drain the pool?
No, if you put a ten-foot crack in them, they drain themselves.
They did have to drain the gym.
Ooh.
But I have a plan-- I want you to take the letter and hide it.
Okay, and then what?
And then I'll come up with an idea later.
That's all I got so far.
Yeah, we're kind of in the same boat.
We're stuck in the house with nothing to do.
You should go to the arcade on Hillcrest.
The manager there has an enlightened outlook on a kid's right to choose his own school hours.
We don't have any money, though.
All right, you guys are doing me a favor so I'll let you in on a little secret.
Mom keeps some money in the top left drawer of her dresser but she won't notice if you only take between five and seven dollars.
What are you boys doing?
Looking for your money.
It's not there.
I moved it to the back of the closet.
Where she hides our Christmas presents?
No I moved those to the attic.
Um, Mom, where'd you hide that football I broke the window with?
In the garage.
And when you made chipped beef on toast last week was that really beef?
Who knows?
It was 39 cents a pound.
Did Grandpa really punch Jimmy Carter in the face?
No, he just threw a rock at the motorcade and ran off.
Did you really give my red blanket to the poor kids?
No, your father used it to clean the barbecue.
I was really adopted, wasn't I?
Oh, you're ours and we love you.
Damn.
So, um I don't know.
What's your favorite color?
For the third time, green.
Let's just go.
Wait.
I got a good one.
How'd you know Dewey's bike wasn't really stolen?
That is a good one.
Francis told me.
I can't believe it!
Francis ratted on us to Mom!
No!
He wouldn't do that.
You did it!
Shut up!
He sold us out!
Francis is dead to us now!
Wait a minute-- That makes me the oldest brother.
Guys, seriously-- If you have any problems, you can come to me.
Dewey, get me some iced tea.
No!
We should just give this to Mom and let him fry.
Right.
No, wait!
It's Francis.
We can't just take Mom's word for it.
Hey, Malcolm, everything okay?
Um, Francis we were just wondering Mom said you ratted on us about Dewey's bike.
But she's probably just mixed up, right?
Because you're our big brother and you wouldn't do something like that-- Francis?
You don't know what kind of pressure I was under!
You butt-wipe!
How could you?
Well, did he do it?
I can't believe you!
You're our big brother!
You're supposed to protect us, not betray us.
He did it, didn't he?
Malcolm, let me explain And then you actually have the nerve to ask us to risk our butts for you?
Maybe we should just give the letter to Mom.
- No, you can't do that!
- Yeah, why not?
Because if you give the letter to Mom she'll know it's not Sunday.
I'll just tell her it came special delivery.
Yeah, well, she won't believe it 'cause she would have to sign for it.
I could forge her signature.
But then she'll know you can forge her signature.
Which won't matter at all because she'll be so mad at you she won't even think about me for a few days.
And even if she does, I'll just tell her I didn't want to disturb her.
So in addition to you getting nailed I'll get points for being sympathetic.
Put Reese on the phone.
You know, Hal, owning a Porsche is not just for the wealthy anymore.
My lifemate and I, we both drive 'em.
Really?
Oh, she's a very lucky lady.
Oh.
A blond.
This is going to sound cliched, Hal but what can I do to put you in that car today?
You can give me $90,000.
That's funny.
Yeah.
Seriously, we have all kinds of financial plans available.
Why don't we take it for a test drive?
Nah, I I don't know.
I would have to call work and There's a phone in the car.
So, do we give Mom the letter now or wait till dad gets home and give him both barrels?
Now!
Do it now!
We're not giving Mom the letter.
Of course we are!
We have to!
He's a traitor!
He has to pay!
He must suffer!
We can't give Mom the letter.
She'd kill him.
But we can make him think we're giving her the letter.
We could make him think we're scuzzy, dirty backstabbers just like he is.
Oh, okay.
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
Well, if it isn't the snitch.
Hi, snitch.
Come on, Malcolm.
Let's just end this before it gets out of control.
I know how you guys feel.
You do, huh?
How do we feel?
Well bad.
No.
The words that come to my mind are revenge, payback, envelope.
Malcolm, you're not going to give Mom the letter.
I don't think you're in any position to call the shots.
No, but Richie should be right about now.
- Richie?
- Yeah?
That was the best 1 2 minutes of my life.
Well, I'm glad to hear that, Hal.
You know, there are a couple of people I'd like you to meet.
Francis: Okay, listen up: My mom's in her bedroom, so you gotta keep it down and remember, don't hurt my brothers.
Circus!
It's okay.
It was ugly.
Man,just get the letter and don't let Malcolm out of your sight.
He's too smart.
Uh-oh.
What do you mean, ''uh-oh''?
What did he do?
He's out of breath.
Damn it!
He hid the letter.
Okay, kid, you've got three seconds to tell me or I'm going to pound you within an Richie!
Which part of''no hurting my brothers'' didn't you understand?
I got to tell you, man you're not allowing me a single creative thought here.
: Where'd you put it?
In the VCR.
If we set fire to the house Malcolm will go right for the letter.
Why would he go right for the letter?
Well, maybe we should just set fire to the house and find out.
PutJustin on the phone.
You the man, Francis.
You the man!
Put Richie back on the phone.
Hey, you can tear up the house if you want with my mom here and explain it to her or you can quit and slink away like the monosyllabic mouth-breathers you are.
What'd he say?
He said a lot of things but the gist of it is, we got to tear up the house.
No, you can't do that.
Just Wait a minute, I have an idea.
Look at Reese.
What's he doing?
He's just sitting there.
No, look at his eyes.
What are his eyes doing?
They're looking back at me.
Okay,just keep looking at him.
He's looking at the VCR.
No, I-I was looking at the the other thing.
Bingo!
We got it!
Justin: You're the man, Richie!
All right!
Who wants a latte?
I'm really sorry, you guys.
For what?
You were perfect.
You did exactly what I thought you'd do.
What are you talking about?
They have a fake letter.
I knew Francis wouldn't leave us alone without getting something and I knew you'd give it away.
I knew exactly what everyone would do.
So where's the real letter?
I had to think of the one place they'd never think of looking.
I had to give it to the one person they'd never think I'd give it to.
I did the most brilliant thing of all: I gave it to Dewey.
And I hid it under Mom's pillow.
You what?
!
I'm going to kill him.
I am going to kill him!
I am going to kill him.
This is all a dream.
Oh, shut up, Reese!
Mom, stop it.
You're sick.
I'm too mad to be sick.
No, he has finally done it this time.
Where is that brochure for the work farm in Arizona?
He thinks military school is tough?
Just wait.
Wait.
Wait Wait Wait!
Hey, Malcolm?
Hi, Francis.
Look, I'm sorry about all this.
I shouldn't have sent those guys over.
It was stupid.
You know, Francis We never intended to show the letter to Mom.
We just wanted to scare you.
Yeah, I know.
You guys would never do that to me.
But if she did see the letter you know it was just an accident, right?
Yeah, but Richie has the letter.
Please tell me Richie has the letter.
Richie has coupons.
Mom has the letter.
But like I said, it was just an accident.
I swear.
So the thing you've been threatening to do all day but had no intention of doing, you did but didn't mean to?
Yeah.
You can yell at us now.
No, I guess I deserve it.
I shouldn't have ratted on you guys.
Mom was just really pressuring me about coming home and, well, I folded.
Coming home?
She said that if I wanted to come home for the summer I had to tell her about the bike.
But that's a just a lame excuse.
I'm sorry.
Actually, that was a pretty good excuse.
Wow, you have made a great deal here, Hal.
Now, you just, uh, sign right there and she's all yours.
Yeah, you know, I been thinking I think maybe I got a little overexcited.
Aw, that's just the jitters.
They'll be long gone when you're roaring home in your brand-new Porsche.
-Just sign.
- No, I think maybe we should do this another time because I'm not feeling very well and my wife has the flu I'll tell you what-- Let's throw in the new chrome turbo wheels and free car washes for a year--Just sign.
I can't.
But, Hal you put your initials by this number.
Sorry.
Maybe some other time.
Hal, will you do me one favor?
One favor, now, I want you just to stick your head in the car one last time, okay?
I want you to smell the leather take another look at that console and tell me you don't want this car.
Go ahead, do it.
Come on.
So what do you say?
I told you I was sick!
Oh, my God!
You guys we can save Francis.
- What?
!
- Think about it-- Every time she gets mad she forgets about everything else in the world except for things she's mad at.
That focus is the key to her power.
So?
So mom won't care so much about sending Francis to a work farm if she's busy being mad at someone else, like at us.
We can do that.
- Yeah.
- You don't understand.
We're going to have to get in real trouble more trouble than we've ever been in, in our entire lives.
And we can't make it look like we're doing it on purpose.
I just want you to know what you guys are in for.
We owe it to him.
Dad's skating trophy Mom and Dad's wedding portrait Mom's favorite lamp.
No, Dewey, it's stuff they like, not you.
Oh.
Good!
Paint?
!
Yeah.
That way, we not only destroy the stuff we take out the driveway splash on the house and, with any luck get some collateral damage to the neighbors.
What a waste!
For any other reason this would've been the funnest thing ever.
Okay, guys have the last candy bars of your childhood.
: Wake up!
Wake up!
It's time to wake up!
Okay, here she comes.
Now, remember, this is supposed to be fun.
Well, I guess it's mission accomplished.
I don't think Mom even remembers she has a son named Francis.
Lois: Boys!
Just come down.
We're not coming down until you tell us what you're going to do.
Not going to tell you what I'm going to do until you come down.
Why don't you just tell us?
Why don't you just come down?
Tell us.
Come down.
Reese: Just tell us!
Come down.
Malcolm: But if you tell us, we'll come down.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Who wants to make five bucks?
All: How?
I need someone to take the fall.
- Lois: Oh, my God!
- What did you do?
I can't tell you.
Yes or no, no questions asked.
Lois: Oh, my God!
Make it ten.
Done.
Lois: Oh, my God!
You're a good son.
I got him, honey!
I got him!
Don't worry.
Yes, no, maybe I don't know Can you repeat the question You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now You're not the boss of me now And you're not so big Life is unfair.
There you go-- all pink and shiny.
Mm.
Boys?
!
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
Ooh!
Feel ten pounds lighter.
You ready?
Oh, yeah.
Go.
Uh, aah  Dad got us free tickets at the water slide park from work.
It takes two days to prep him, but it's worth it.
Ooh, smooth as a seal.
Ready for that water slide.
You know, we haven't been on an outing in a long time.
It's nice when we can do things together as a family.
Do what together?
: Why can't I go?
Dewey, we discussed this.
You have to stay home because of your ear infection.
I never get to go.
Honey, I know it seems like a pattern but it's just this.
And Disneyland.
Oh, and that chocolate factory tour.
Maybe it's time to stop sticking dirty things in your ears.
Reese: Hey, Dewey.
How's the ear?
Stop teasing him, Reese!
If your father doesn't find a baby-sitter, nobody's going anywhere.
Oh, no, no, no.
It's just the little one.
Yeah, the other two aren't going to be anywhere near you.
Ever since I can remember we've always had trouble with baby-sitters.
: Hello!
Goochy, goochy, goochy, goo.
Goochy, goochy  Woman: I don't know, sweetie.
What do you have behind your back?
Man: You little losers.
I've had enough of this.
You open this door right now.
Okay, look.
I'm a little claustrophobic.
Just open the door!
Let me out!
Come on!
I don't know.
I'm starting to think it might be us.
Well, you'd think I'd get bored wiping the floor with my cadets.
God knows we enjoy it, sir.
Do you know what your problem is, cadet?
Discipline.
Anything worth doing is worth doing well.
Whatever I do, whether it's teaching you boys or mastering tai chi, or playing pool I focus.
I push myself.
But you don't commit to anything, son.
You're never going to be a winner because you do everything half-assed.
Oh, regrettable.
You may have spoken too soon, sir.
I think you'll find I play pool with my whole ass.
Eight ball, corner pocket.
Damn.
Ah, the fatal scratch.
Once again, I waltz with Lady Victory.
And until you focus, Francis she is never going to be your dance partner.
Lois: Thank you for coming on such short notice.
It was so nice of your agency to give us a second chance.
You two are going to have so much fun together.
: Don't you dare hurt her.
Hurry, the sun's coming up!
Do you want to play something?
No.
Hey, hey, look, kids.
- Only 1 2 more miles to Wavetown, USA.
- Yay.
So, Malcolm, you going to go down the Liquidator this time?
Don't pressure the boy, Hal.
I'm not pressuring him.
I'm just asking.
He's scared enough as it is without you making a big deal out of it.
Hey, Mom, doesn't Malcolm have to wear - his nose plug for his sinuses?
- Shut up.
Oh, that's right.
I forgot it.
Listen, you just be very careful then, okay?
Don't worry, here it is.
Oh.
Thank you, Reese.
: Jerk.
Oh, my gosh, look at this!
Reese: This is awesome!
I can't wait to get on the rides.
Malcolm, don't think you can take off that nose plug just because I'm not looking.
You're going to wear it all day.
- I'm not even in the water.
- If I catch you not wearing that nose plug, you're going to spend the day in the kiddie sprinkler.
What do you want to do first?
What makes you think I want to do anything with you?
What's your problem?
That nose-plug thing was bogus.
You crossed the line, Reese.
What?
!
You sold me out to Mom.
It would've been different if I had done something to you, but that was totally cold-blooded.
Don't be such a baby.
What you did to me was an act of war.
And believe me, I will get you back.
You won't know where or when, but you're gonna pay.
You sound funny.
You wanted to see me, sir?
I just got a call from the sheriff that a cocksure, smart-mouthed youth looking very much like yourself has been hustling pool at the local bars.
Really, sir?
You are in serious trouble, cadet.
I can explain Why have you been holding back when we've played pool?
What?
I want to know why you've been letting me win.
Sir, if I played for real I'd just end up humiliating you in front of the school, and and you'd, you know, torture us all for it.
Really, nothing good could come from it, and and besides, winning seems to make you so happy.
I am not a child.
Do you really think me so petty that I would throw a tantrum over something so small as a game of pool?
!
My mistake, sir.
We are going to play again.
And you are going to give me your best game, cadet.
And to make sure of that, if you don't win picture yourself, 0400, awakened from sweet dreams of Mommy sent outside into the bitter cold to raise our school colors and stand at attention for three hours until reveille is called.
Now, picture that for 230 consecutive days.
But what if I try my best and I still lose?
Then you shall be miserable indeed.
Dismissed.
Remember, honey, how I promised you that exotic island vacation but we had to go have children instead?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I was thinking maybe today could be our little island getaway.
We've got the sun, the sand, the palm trees.
And I brought the cocktails.
It's Malibu Rum in a lotion bottle so no one will know the difference.
You are so cute when you sneak in alcohol.
Hey, Reese, I think I just saw that girl you liked.
You know, the one with the really long blonde hair.
- April?
- April, that's her.
Why'd you say you liked her again?
She's real trampy.
I hear she kisses with tongue.
Is that true, April?
Jerk!
Now we're even.
You geek!
You deserved it!
Malcolm: Ow!
Get outta here!
I think those are ours.
No.
I'll take care of it.
Lois: Malcolm, Reese, knock it off!
.
Can I watch TV?
No.
Can I play video games?
No.
What can I do?
Something quiet.
Quieter.
I can do this.
Keep your arms and legs crossed at all times.
Do not bend your legs.
Do not raise your head.
Remove all piercings.
You may not wear anything around neck.
Enjoy the ride.
Okay, here it goes.
On three.
One two three!
Hey, there, girlie.
Let me adjust your bra strap.
-  - Now we're even.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
First, we sort by the number of holes then by color.
What's in your mouth?
Nothing.
There are at least 20 things I will not tolerate and lying is one of them.
Spit it out.
You're eating my buttons.
I wasn't eating.
I was saving.
What are you?
A hamster?
What were you saving it for?
I don't know.
It's pretty.
It's my favorite one.
You know actually, it's my favorite, too.
What do you think of this one?
It's ugly.
I hate it.
So do I. My, you're a smart little boy.
You seem to be practicing pretty hard.
I hope you're not planning on doing something stupid, like winning.
Look, guys, I know you want me to lose but Spangler insisted I play a real game.
Francis, you can't win.
If you do, Spangler's going to take it out on us.
Remember when Hendrix beat him playing horse on a lucky shot?
We couldn't watch anything but PBS for a week.
And that was during pledge drive, man.
Guys, come on.
Do you have any idea what Spangler's going to do to me if I lose?
Do you know what we're going to do to you if you win?
Ew!
Where were we?
Mom!
You have to stop Reese!
He's being a total jerk!
Malcolm, does it look like I'm open for business?
You have done nothing but pester us.
Is it too much to ask that your father and I enjoy one day?
But Reese is I don't want to hear it.
You either take care of this yourself or I'm going to lock the two of you in the car for the rest of the day.
I mean it.
Lifeguard, help!
My brother-- he can't swim.
Out of the way, guys!
Drowning boy!
Drowning boy!
Drowning boy!
Give him some air, guys.
Give him some air.
Back up.
Sir!
Let the people who work here do that.
Now we're even.
And then, I was playing with my imaginary friend and Reese hit me because he said I shouldn't talk to myself.
Well, Reese is a horrid little boy.
There's nothing wrong with having an imaginary friend.
I talk to my Harold all the time.
- You do?
- Of course.
He's here right now.
Would he like a cookie?
Sure.
No, no, no.
He's over there.
- Yes!
- Yes!
Sorry, sir.
It's understandable, cadet.
I've seen professionals do much worse.
I guess the pool gods are smiling on me today.
But then, the pool gods can be fickle.
That's okay, sir.
You'll win the next one.
Sir, what are you doing?
I think I'm losing.
And gracefully, I'd like to be noted.
But you could have made that shot.
I could say the same thing to you.
There were at least a dozen shots that you've held back on.
But since you seem to be motivated more by losing I'm going to beat you at your own game.
Huh?
I'm going down, cadet.
I'm going down hard.
But sir, these guys are going to kick my ass if I win.
Well, that's just gravy.
May the best man lose.
Fudge!
It seems I've scratched again.
Well, you seem to be on a roll, cadet.
Ah-ooh It's Christmas with leather Christmas with leather Freaks fly together Makin' all the big boys scream All right All right Turn it up now Turn it up now - ?
All right ?
- ?
All right ?
Turn it up now Ah-ah-ah Went up to the She's always Rising up the dance floor I just want to watch you dance  Can you hear the drums, Fernando I remember long ago another starry night like this In the firelight, Fernando You were humming to yourself And softly strumming your guitar I could hear the distant drums And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar There was something in the air that night The stars were bright, Fernando They were shining there for you and me For liberty, Fernando Though we never thought that we could lose There's no regret If I had to do the same again I would, my friend, Fernando There was something in the air that night The stars were bright   Before you say anything, Malcolm I just want to tell you, I don't want to hear it.
Can't you give your mother and me five minutes of peace?
You know what?
You can have the rest of the day because I've given up.
I'm not going to have any fun anyway, so why try?
As long as we're on the same page.
Today sucked.
I've done nothing except chicken out get laughed at and fight with Reese.
So now, I'm just going to lie down enjoy the sun and wait for them to take me home.
Now we're even.
Now we're Boys!
Reese, I've done some soul-searching and hereby offer my full apology.
It was very wrong of me.
I'm truly sorry for my inappropriate behavior.
The terrible guilt I'm feeling is punishment enough Hey, no cutting in line.
Oh, it's you again.
Reese, I am so sorry.
I really, really mean it.
Do you think we're wealthy?
!
What?
!
Do you think we're wealthy?
Wealthy people drive fancy cars.
They buy fresh pasta.
Do we do any of those things?
No!
Wealthy people can afford to have their vacations ruined.
No big deal.
They just pick up and they go again.
Your father and I work so hard.
We work so long.
What is wrong with you two?
!
Are you aborigines?
!
Every time I turn around, I hear someone screaming and fighting, and I pray to God it's someone else's kids, but it's not.
It's always you!
Sane children would appreciate this but you have to keep going at each other like rabid monkeys!
It is not enough that you do this every day.
You have to make me suffer, too.
So help me!
Don't you dare!
Arms and legs crossed at all times!
That is the bravest thing I've ever seen you do.
Yeah.
You're going to die.
I know.
So, do you think she's okay?
Lois: This is the last time I take you boys anywhere!
Good playing.
Same to you, sir.
Hey, who won?
Who cares, man?
