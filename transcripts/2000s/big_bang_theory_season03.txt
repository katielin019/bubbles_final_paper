{START OF EPISODE 1}
Previously on The Big Bang Theory: I'm going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.
-For three months?
-Yes.
What did you mean when you said you were going to miss me?
It means I wish you weren't going.
Oh, thank God we're home.
I can't believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.
It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
I don't know what Arctic expedition you were on I thought it was a hoot and a half.
Oh, hi, Mom.
No.
I told you I'd call you when I got home.
I'm not home yet.
All right.
I'm home.
The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success.
I'm all but certain there's a Nobel Prize in my future.
Actually, I shouldn't say that.
I'm entirely certain.
No, Mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety.
The fact that I'm home safe doesn't prove it worked.
That logic is post hoc ergo propter hoc.
No, I'm not sassing you in Eskimo talk.
-I'm gonna let Penny know we're back.
-Mother, I have to go.
Yeah, love you.
Bye.
Hello, old friend.
Daddy's home.
Leonard, you're back.
Yeah, I just stopped by to say-- -Yeah, so hi.
-Hi.
Damn it, I should've gone over and told her we were back.
Yeah, it was first come, first serve.
I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings -I won't forget your contributions.
-Great.
I can't mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech.
When I write my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote and perhaps a signed copy.
-We have to tell him.
-Tell me what?
Damn his Vulcan hearing.
You are planning a party for me, aren't you?
Okay, Sheldon, sit down.
If there's going to be a theme, I should let you know I don't care for luau, toga or under the sea.
Yeah.
We'll keep that in mind.
Look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.
If this is about the night the heat went out there's nothing to be embarrassed about.
-It's not about that.
-We agreed to never speak of it again.
So we slept together naked.
It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
-He's speaking about it.
-For me it was a bonding moment.
Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious giant dictator?
I thought we were gonna be gentle with him.
That's why I added the "tator".
And when we finally got our first positive data you were so happy.
Oh, yes.
In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D. Well, ahem, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn't so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.
He just went colon, capital O. -You tampered with my experiment?
-We had to.
It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian.
You see that?
I added the "ensian".
Did Leonard know about this?
Leonard's my best friend.
Surely Leonard didn't know.
-It was his idea.
-Of course it was.
The whole plan reeks of Leonard.
-I missed you so much.
-I missed you too.
-I couldn't think of anyone else.
-Me neither.
Except for one night when the heat went out.
Long story.
It's-- Don't ask.
Leonard.
Leonard.
Leonard.
Do not make a sound.
Whispering, "Do not make a sound" is a sound.
Damn his Vulcan hearing.
Not a good time, Sheldon.
Penny.
Penny.
Penny.
Ugh, this is ridiculous.
-What?
-Hello, Penny.
I realize you're currently at the mercy of your biological urges but as you have a lifetime of poor decisions ahead, may I interrupt this one?
Great to see you too.
Come on in.
Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception.
Do you have anything to say?
Yes, I feel terrible about it.
I will never forgive myself.
I don't expect you to.
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance.
Can someone tell me what's going on here?
What's going on is I was led to believe I was making strides in science when in fact I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.
Is that true?
-It was the only way to make him happy.
-Why'd you have to make him happy?
Because when he wasn't happy we wanted to kill him.
That was even a plan.
We were going to throw his Kindle outside.
And when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.
-That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
-No.
The overreaction was to tie your limbs to four different sled-dog teams and yell, "Mush"!
Look, we kept the original data.
You can still publish the actual results.
Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful.
I sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining I confirmed string theory and forever changed man's understanding of the universe.
Oh.
See, yeah, you probably shouldn't have done that.
So write another e-mail.
Set the record straight.
It's no big deal.
You're right, Leonard.
That's not a big deal.
All you did was lie to me, destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university.
That, FYI, was sarcasm.
I, in fact, believe it is a big deal.
-Oh.
That poor thing.
-Yeah, I feel terrible.
Wait.
Aren't you gonna go talk to him?
Well, I-- He'll be fine.
The guy's a trouper.
Come here.
No, no, you're right.
You shouldn't talk to him.
I will.
Man, I cannot catch a break.
-Hey.
Do you wanna talk?
-About what?
Being betrayed by my friends?
Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing?
And I didn't even get to go to Comic-Con.
Oh, hon--  Soft kitty, warm kitty That's for when I'm sick.
Sad is not sick.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't know your sad song.
I don't have a sad song.
I'm not a child.
Well, you know, I do understand what you're going through.
Really?
Did you have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
Well, no.
But, uh, when I was in high school, one of my friends heard I was gonna be named head cheerleader.
I was so excited.
My mom even made me a celebration pie.
Then they named stupid Valerie Mosbacher head cheerleader.
Big old slutbag.
Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
Well, they're pretty tasty.
And on a different but not unrelated topic based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?
Look, I just don't think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you.
They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation.
You know what it's like?
Remember the new Star Trek movie?
Kirk has to take over the ship so he tells Spock stuff he knew wasn't true.
Like saying Spock didn't care his mom died.
I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie?
-I like the new look.
-Thanks.
I call it the Clooney.
I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever.
Hey, how's Sheldon doing?
He came out of his room wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I'd say a little better.
If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally?
You know.
-Howard.
-I don't care but my genitals wanted me to ask.
Tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business.
He says they didn't do it.
Sheldon, over here.
What are you doing?
Well, I feel bad for the guy.
Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?
Because I am without friends.
Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone.
Even while seated.
Come on.
We said we were sorry.
It's going to take more than an "I'm sorry" and an apology pie from Penny to make up for what you've done to me.
Hey, Cooper.
Read your retraction e-mail.
Way to destroy your reputation.
You see?
People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
It's not true.
People have been pointing and laughing at you your whole life.
All right, I've had enough.
Attention, everyone.
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
As many of you in the Physics Department know my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.
Off a cliff.
-My credibility may have been damaged.
-Completely wrecked.
But I would like to remind you that in science there's no such thing as failure.
There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career.
That man's name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.
Yeah, but research into dark energy proved Einstein's cosmological constant was actually right all along.
So you're still, surprise, surprise, a loser.
Oh, you think you're so clever.
Well, let me just tell you.
While I do not currently have a retort check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.
So much for our friendship with Sheldon.
Well, we'll always have the night the heat went out.
-Hi.
-Hey.
Since we got interrupted last night, I didn't have a chance to give you this.
Aw, Leonard.
You shouldn't have.
Oh, boy.
Ha, ha.
What is it?
It's a snowflake from the North Pole.
-Are you serious?
-Uh-huh.
It'll last forever.
I preserved it in a God, that's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me that I didn't understand.
It's actually a pretty simple process.
You see, cyanoacrylates are monomers, which polymerize-- Red alert.
Leonard, Sheldon ran away.
Man, I cannot catch a break.
So how do you know he ran away?
I mean, he's not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation and he sent me a text that said, "I'm running away".
Okay.
Thanks for letting me know.
Well-- Leonard.
Aren't you gonna do something?
Well, of course I'm gonna do something.
Uh, Howard, check the comic-book store.
Raj, go to the Thai restaurant.
I'll stay with Penny in her apartment.
Oh, damn it.
It's Sheldon's mother.
A break cannot be caught.
Hi, Mrs. Cooper.
He is?
Sheldon went home to Texas.
Yeah-- No, I know he resigned.
Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault.
No, no.
You're right.
Someone needs to come talk to him.
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
Yeah.
All right.
New plan.
Howard, you and Raj go to Texas, I'll stay with Penny in her apartment.
-You're not gonna go with them?
-Well, you know I gave you the snowflake, and we were kissing, and-- Come on.
I don't wanna go to Texas.
Oh, right.
And I do?
My people already crossed the desert once.
We're done.
Trust me, you'll be fine.
See you.
Well, wait a second, Leonard.
Come on.
How can you not go?
-He's your best friend.
-But I already saw him naked.
-Just come here.
No.
I promise I will be here when you get back.
Just go help Sheldon.
-Really?
-Yeah.
We waited a few months.
We can wait a few more days.
Maybe you can.
Go.
Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?
-Here you go, Shelly.
-Thanks, Mom.
Yeah.
Hold your horses, young man.
Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.
Oh, Mom.
This is not California, land of the heathen.
Give me.
By his hand we are all-- Fed.
-Give us, Lord, our daily-- -Bread.
-Please know that we are truly-- -Grateful.
-For every cup and every-- -Plateful.
Amen.
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
Whatever.
Jesus still loves you.
Thank you for carving a smiley face in my sandwich.
I know how to take care of my baby.
His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he's Chinese.
So do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?
-They're not my friends.
-All right.
If you recall, when you were little we sat right here at this very spot and talked about the problems you had getting along with the neighbor kids.
That was different.
They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that's why they hated me.
Oh, baby, they knew very well why they hated you.
I can't believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
Hello?
I'm wearing a red turtleneck.
Plus it was the only boys' large they had.
I'm sorry.
This does not look like Texas.
Where's the tumbleweeds?
-Where's the saloons?
-Saloons?
Like in the movies I saw growing up.
You know, uh, 4 for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas.
This neighborhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
What can I tell you?
They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.
Will you please take that stupid hat off?
No, I wanna blend in.
To what?
Toy Story?
Hi, boys.
-Howdy, ma'am.
-Howdy to you too.
You got here quick.
-We took the redeye.
-Come on in.
Thank you kindly.
-Can I get you something to drink?
-No, thank you.
If y'all don't mind, I got a hankering for a Lone Star Beer.
There's no alcohol in this household, stop talking like that and lose the hat.
Sorry.
I'll take a diet Yoo-hoo if you have it.
You'll take a cola.
What about you?
Raj, is it?
Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies?
Ha-ha-ha.
Because, you know, at our church we have a woman who's an amazing healer.
Mostly she does crutch and wheelchair people but I bet she'd be willing to take a shot at whatever Third-World demon is running around inside of you.
If you don't mind, there's a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles and you have no idea how much I wanna be on it.
-A girl?
-Uh, yes, ma'am.
Oh, good.
I've been praying for you.
Oh, Sheldon.
What are they doing here?
-We came to apologize.
-Again.
And bring you home.
Pack up your stuff and we'll head back.
No.
This is my home now.
Thanks to you, my career is over.
I will spend the rest of my life here trying to teach evolution to creationists.
You watch your mouth, Shelly.
Everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Evolution isn't an opinion, it's fact.
And that is your opinion.
I forgive you, let's go home.
Don't tell me prayer doesn't work.
How about that?
Finally caught a break.
Uh-huh.
You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
Sure.
-Why does it have to get weird?
-Pbbt.
I don't know.
I mean, we were friends and now we're more than friends.
And we're whatever this is.
But why label it, right?
I mean-- It is what it is and-- -Leonard?
-Yeah?
-It's weird.
-Totally.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Sheldon, you're wrong.
Wolverine was not born with bone claws.
Howard, you know me to be a very smart man.
Don't you think if I were wrong, I'd know it?
-First of all-- -Give it up.
You're arguing with a crazy person.
I'm not crazy.
My mother had me tested.
-Hey, guys.
-What are you doing here?
What?
It's new-comic-book night.
Since you and Penny hooked up we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.
There's more to life than sex, Raj.
Who had Leonard flames out in 24 hours?
I did.
Nothing flamed out.
We don't have to have sex every night.
You don't have to, but it's highly recommended.
Take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.
It's not a matter of opportunity.
We're getting to know each other.
There's a learning curve.
What's to learn?
You get naked, do nasty things.
Then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami.
Easy-peasy.
Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of sexual dysfunction.
Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?
Oh.
A clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.
Nothing like that happened, all right?
The sex was just fine.
Just fine?
Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.
I'm not saying it was bad.
I'm just saying it wasn't great.
Okay, you mean for both of you?
Because we can totally see it not being great for her.
Am I right?
To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little-- I don't know-- -Disappointed?
Let down?
-Ashamed?
Horrified?
Repulsed?
All I know is it wasn't the way I dreamed it would be.
Sex is never the way I dream it's gonna be.
That's because in your dreams, you're a horse from the waist down.
Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin Miniseries Issue 2, page 22.
Retractable bone claws.
If you spent less time thinking about sex and more time on comic books we'd have far fewer of these embarrassing moments.
Sheldon, dinner's here.
Tandoori Palace?
No, we went somewhere new.
You're good-naturedly ribbing me, aren't you?
No, look, Mumbai Palace.
Why?
Why would we change?
We had a perfectly good palace.
Tandoori Palace is our palace.
Trust me, this will be just fine.
You are the authority on just fine.
What's that supposed to mean?
Exactly.
Not bad, but not great.
-What are they talking about?
-I don't know.
-I know.
As I'm sure you're aware-- -Dut!
Dut-dut-dut-dut!
If that's Morse code, that's terrible.
As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter.
Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as, "Just fine".
So, what you're seeing is a continuation of the mocking that followed.
Okay.
Yeah, well, I'm just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere.
Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.
Penny, wait.
Aah.
What is wrong with you?
I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
-Yeah, you-- -Don't tell him.
Let's see if he can figure it out.
-Ugh.
I am so embarrassed.
-Please don't be mad.
-What did you tell them?
-Nothing bad.
Just that last night was fine.
Fine?
You said it was fine?
Yeah.
It's a perfectly good word.
You put it in front of "wine" or "dining" and you've really got something.
Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?
It was okay.
Okay?
Yeah, it's a perfectly good word.
I mean, you put it in front of "dokay" and you really got something.
All right, let's not overreact.
It takes time to get to know each other's rhythms.
Learn what the other person wants and likes.
-So you've been through this before?
-No.
Okay-dokay.
This is one of those things where talking about it is not gonna make it better.
-Want a glass of wine?
Okay.
-So much.
See, we should've done this last night, you know?
Had a little wine, take the edge off.
Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.
Don't talk.
Just drink.
No, you're misunderstanding.
A shiksa goddess isn't an actual goddess.
We don't pray to them.
We prey on them.
Whatever, dude.
The point is Leonard's got one and you don't.
Is this it?
It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny's sex life in front of Leonard and Penny.
Good.
Now I can eat.
-What's that?
-Sounds like a cricket.
Hang on.
Based on the number of chirps per minute and the temperature it is a snowy tree cricket.
Oh.
Give me a fricking break.
How could you possibly know that?
In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature.
A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.
How do you know the temperature of this room?
Under the terms of my roommate agreement I've had control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of '06.
Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws but you're wrong about the cricket.
Howard, don't embarrass yourself.
The science chirps for itself.
Humorous word play.
No, no.
Not this time.
I know insects, my friend.
I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in jars sticking pins through them, mounting them on cardboard with labels identifying the genus and species.
In Latin.
Oh.
Dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.
That is a snowy tree cricket.
Oecanthus fultoni.
I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
Okay.
Tell you what.
I am willing to bet anything that's an ordinary field cricket.
-I can't take your money.
-What's the matter, you chicken?
I've always found that an inappropriate slur.
Chickens are not at all timid.
In fact, when I was young, my neighbor's chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.
-Chickens can't climb trees.
-Thank God.
Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch.
The cricket thing, I don't buy.
Bet me.
Fair enough.
What stakes do you propose?
I will put up my Fantastic Four Number 48 first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic "Flash of Two Worlds" issue.
All right, you have a wager.
Hmm.
Great.
Now, how are you gonna settle it?
Hmm?
There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.
I wonder what the nonpathetic people are doing tonight.
-More wine?
-Hit me.
-I don't see anything.
-Shh.
Hallway.
Ahh.
One at a time.
What was that?
My stomach.
Indian food doesn't agree with me.
Ironic, isn't it?
Elevator shaft.
Help me open it.
Are you crazy?
We can't go down an empty elevator shaft.
If you don't wanna proceed, then you forfeit the bet and I'll take possession of your Fantastic Four.
Let's open her up.
Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
Don't push me, Sheldon.
I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13 and I remember a good deal of it.
Oh, really?
I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister.
And I could easily best you in any physical confrontation.
Be it noogies, swirlies or the classic, "Why are you hitting yourself"?
Ooh.
Big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.
-Ahem.
-What are we drinking now?
Peppermint schnapps.
Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
Because I like peppermint and it's fun to say "schnapps".
-Hey, Leonard?
-What?
Schnapps.
Schnapps.
You're right, that is fun.
Be careful.
If I were not being careful your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.
Stairwell.
Uh-oh.
Flashlight went out.
I need some batteries.
Fellas?
Hello?
It's really dark down here.
Oh, sweetie, you really can't hold your liquor, can you?
I'm okay.
Just a little mouthwash and then I'm gonna rock your world.
Are you okay?
Oh.
Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?
His name isn't Toby.
Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
-What would you name him?
-An appropriate cricket name.
For example, Jiminy.
All right, Sheldon, here we go.
Kleingast's Field Guide to North American Insects.
Hey, Toby.
Right here.
See it?
"The common field cricket, a.k.a. Gryllus assimilis" which is Latin for "suck it, you lose".
Hang on.
VoilÃ .
"The snowy tree cricket, a.k.a. Oecanthus fultoni" which is Latin for "I'll suck nothing".
Of course, I'm joking, because the Latin for that is "nihil exsorbibo".
That is not Toby, this is Toby.
Raj, what do you think?
Oh.
I really don't care anymore.
-God, I had the most horrible night.
-What happened?
Obviously another carnal fiasco with the "shiksi" goddess.
Shiksa.
Shiksa.
Forgive me.
Yiddish was not spoken in East Texas.
And if it was, it wasn't spoken for long.
Yeah, fine, whatever.
The point is you're wrong, again.
We haven't established that I'm wrong once.
Let's go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor Crawley tell us what kind of cricket Toby is.
He's a snowy tree cricket.
And his name is Jiminy.
I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
Holy crap.
It's like Silence of the Lambs down here.
Don't do that.
Don't be such a girl.
They're just bugs.
I don't like bugs, okay?
They freak me out.
Interesting.
You're afraid of insects and women.
Ladybugs must render you catatonic.
It was a joke.
I made it to lessen your discomfort.
You're welcome.
Ha-ha.
Don't knock.
Just walk in.
Why be polite to the world's leading expert on the dung beetle?
Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?
Who wants to know?
I'm Dr. Cooper, from the Physics Department.
-Couldn't wait, huh?
-I'm sorry?
I haven't even packed yet and you're already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines.
No, you don't understand.
We just wanna ask you a question.
Let me ask you one first.
What's a world-renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience, to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?
Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
What's your deal?
Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?
I'm from New Delhi.
-We should find another entomologist.
-We're here.
Let's settle this.
Professor, can you identify our cricket?
Of course I can.
I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet.
Not that that's gonna keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard.
And we're not talking Oxnard at the beach.
No.
We're talking Oxnard in the onion fields.
-Well, could you look at Toby?
-Toby?
What a stupid name for a cricket.
Told you.
It's a field cricket.
-Yes.
-No, wait.
Dr. Crawley, are you sure?
Young man, I've been studying insects since I was 8 years old.
You know what they used to call me in school?
Creepy Crawley.
Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.
Let me show you something.
See that?
That's a Crawley's dung beetle.
I discovered it after spending six months slogging through the Bornean rain forests while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans.
So when I tell you that that's a common field cricket you can take that to the damn bank.
Because God knows I can't.
That tramp took me for everything.
Well, apparently I was wrong.
Congratulations.
Enjoy Oxnard.
I'm sure your daughter's looking forward to having you.
Oh, hey, Sheldon.
What you got there?
New comic book?
Old comic book.
I just retrieved it from my safe-deposit box.
What do you have a safe-deposit box for?
Old comic books.
I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
What, do they have Wii cricket now?
That can't be very popular.
Penny, I'd rather not talk about it.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm not feeling so hot either.
Why would that make me feel better?
I don't know, empathy?
I'm just saying that you're feeling upset about something with Howard and I'm upset about something with Leonard.
Yes, the disappointing sex.
That's an inexact parallel.
You and Leonard can always return to being friends.
I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley's chicken.
What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?
A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
-Okay, forget the chicken.
-I wish I could.
No, no.
You may be right about me and Leonard.
Well, of course I'm right.
What are the odds I'd be wrong twice in one week?
No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.
I just said that-- This conversation has started to circle.
Meeting adjourned.
-Hello.
-Hey.
What's going on?
Oh, you'd like to catch up on the events of the day.
All right.
Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe-deposit box.
I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems.
And, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance pride wenteth before my fall causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.
Wait a minute.
You talked to Penny about our sex life?
Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial.
I lost a bet to Wolowitz.
-You're saying you talked to Penny?
-Yes.
-Interesting.
-Hardly.
Excuse me.
Have I crossed some sort of line again?
Little bit.
Hmm.
Oh.
Who cares?
-Oh, hey.
-Hey, what did Sheldon say to you?
Not a lot.
That we always have the option of going back to being friends.
-Is that what you want?
-I don't know.
I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.
I guess.
-It would take the pressure off.
-It would, wouldn't it?
So we'll just be friends.
Good.
Good.
Come here.
Okay-dokay.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Goin' out tonight I'm feelin' all right Gonna let it all hang out Wanna make some noise Really raise my voice Yeah, I wanna scream and shout Unh!
No-- Morning, Sheldon.
Come dance with me.
No.
Why not?
Penny, while I subscribe to the Many-Worlds theory which posits the existence of infinite Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that none of them am I dancing.
Are you fun in any of them?
The math would suggest that in a few, I'm a clown made of candy.
But I don't dance.
-All right, want some French toast?
-It's oatmeal day.
Tell you what, next French toast day, I will make you oatmeal.
Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French toast day?
Morning.
Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.
Sorry, I haven't given her your schedule yet.
It's an iCal download.
She can put it right in her phone.
And we agreed you'd have conjugal visits in her apartment.
We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.
I see.
Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
No, her bed kind of broke.
That doesn't seem likely.
Her bed's of sturdy construction.
Even the addition of a second normal-sized human wouldn't cause a structural failure, much less a homunculus such as yourself.
A homunculus?
Perfectly formed miniature human being.
Oh, you're my little homunculus.
Don't do that.
Sorry.
Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?
-I want oatmeal.
-Yes, well I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn't a giant pain in the ass.
Ha, ha.
-I'm sure that will happen soon enough.
But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.
You know what?
I give up.
He's impossible.
I can't be impossible, I exist.
I believe what you meant to say is, "I give up.
He's improbable".
Sheldon, you need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.
What am I supposed to do?
Eat French toast on a Monday?
Now, that would be impossible.
I'm saying you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar.
You can catch even more flies with manure.
What's your point?
It's a--  Boy, that does smell good.
Too bad it's Monday.
Kim, the night manager, went on maternity leave and her husband's name is Sandy.
So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband's name is Kim.
-Wow.
-I know.
What are the odds?
Oh.
Easily calculable.
We begin by identifying the set of couples with unisex names.
We eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work: the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example.
-Next, we look at the--  Sheldon.
It's an amazing coincidence.
Can we leave it at that?
I'm sorry.
Oh, Penny, it's as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.
Oh, Sheldon, it's as if you don't think I'll punch you.
Come on, you guys.
Let it go.
Fine, whatever.
Are you finished?
Well, thank you.
How thoughtful.
Would you like a chocolate?
Um, yeah, sure.
Thanks.
What was that?
You said be nice to Penny.
I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of "nice".
It does.
But in my experience, you don't.
There are more things in heaven and Earth, Horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Yeah, now, that's you.
Obnoxious and insufferable.
What's going on, day dwellers?
Oh, man, did the KISS Army repeal "Don't ask, don't tell"?
No.
Raj and I are going to a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people.
Wanna come along?
Oh, wow, you're actually going out like that?
No, ha, ha.
No.
I'm going out like this.
Howard, what did you do?
They're called tattoo sleeves.
Look.
Yeah, I bought them online.
Raj got a set too.
Fantastic, right?
Put them on, have sex with some girl with her business pierced take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.
You know, I've always wanted to go to a goth nightclub.
-Really?
-Buzzinga.
None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?
Okay, how about you two?
Look, I got some extra tat sleeves.
Why are you carrying extras?
In case I snag one on someone's nipple ring.
Yeah, I think we'll pass.
Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?
In this case, you bet she is.
Ahh.
Yes, she's pushy and, yes, he's whipped, but that's not the expression.
Come on, I wanna stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner.
They're gonna get beaten up at that club.
They're gonna get beaten up at Walgreens.
Oh, sorry, Sheldon.
I almost sat in your spot.
Did you?
I didn't notice.
Have a chocolate.
Thank you.
I think we're fitting in quite nicely.
It'd help if you weren't drinking light beer.
Well, what's so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?
Hello?
It looks like blood.
Did you even read the wikiHow link I sent you on being goth?
No, I'm behind on my wiki reading.
I'm kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.
-What?
-I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client.
He was a lawyer himself, so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.
Just remember, we are lost boys.
Children of the night.
Great.
Lost boys, children of the night.
Got it.
Can you pass the Chex Mix, please?
Thank you.
We are lost boys.
Good for you.
I'm actually much more lost than he is.
Nice ink.
Thanks.
Can we buy you ladies a drink?
Two light beers.
Light beers.
Well, wikiHow about that?
What's your names?
-I'm Howard.
-Raj.
-I'm Bethany.
-Nice to meet you, Bethany.
Yes, very nice.
Nice to meet you too.
I'm Sarah.
Not that anyone cares.
Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?
What's this cartoon called again?
Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.
And it's not a cartoon, it's anime.
Anime.
You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May.
Anna May Fletcher.
She was born with one nostril.
Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.
You're here a lot now.
Oh, am I talking too much?
I'm sorry.
Zip.
-Thank you.
Mm-hm.
Chocolate?
Yes, please.
-Oh.
Hey, Kim.
-Ahh.
Yeah, I-- You know what?
Hold on.
Let me take this in the hall.
Chocolate?
Thank you.
You'll never guess who they got to replace you at work.
Okay.
I know what you're doing.
Really?
Yes.
You're using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behavior.
Very good.
-Chocolate?
-No, I don't want any chocolate.
Sheldon, you can't train my girlfriend like a lab rat.
Actually, it turns out I can.
Well, you shouldn't.
Oh, ugh.
There's just no pleasing you, is there?
You weren't happy with my approach with her so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques building on the works of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner.
Next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool balancing a beach ball on her nose.
No, this has to stop now.
I'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool.
I thought the "buzzinga" was implied.
I'm just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges, if you will.
No, you're not sanding Penny.
Are you saying that I am forbidden from applying a harmless scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?
Yes, you're forbidden.
Bad Leonard.
So, what do you guys do?
Oh, you know, goth stuff.
Goth magazines, goth music.
Goth food.
What's goth food?
Uh.
Blackened salmon?
No, I meant, what do you do for jobs?
-Oh, we're scientists.
-Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.
What are the dark sciences?
Well, I am an astrophysicist, and a lot of that takes place at night.
When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.
That sounds really cool.
Does it?
Well, okay, if you like space stuff I designed components for the space station.
Which is in space.
Where, as I'm sure you know, no one can hear you scream.
So, what do you gals do?
I work at the Gap.
Really?
How about that?
I've been to the Gap.
I've been there as well.
I like your T-shirts with the little pocket.
I work there too.
Not that anyone cares.
You know, this place is boring.
Yeah.
Why don't we go somewhere else and have some fun?
- Okay.
-Sure.
We like fun.
We are fun people.
Uh, dark and fun.
Come on.
I know a place you'll really dig.
-Did you bring the black condoms?
-In my fanny pack.
Let's go.
Are you happy now?
Not particularly.
Oh, my God, she didn't.
What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socio-economic activity that requires a great deal of analysis and planning.
Buzzinga.
You know, using positive reinforcement techniques I could train that behavior out of her in a week.
-No.
-If you let me use negative reinforcement I can get it done before we go to bed.
You're not squirting her in the face with water.
No, of course not.
We're talking very mild electric shocks.
No tissue damage whatsoever.
-Forget it.
-Oh, come on.
You can't tell me that you're not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.
I'm not.
Penny's qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.
You mean like that high-pitched irritating laugh?
Yes.
You wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle?
You're not changing how Penny laughs.
No, that would be incongruous.
I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.
Ugh, sorry, guys.
That girl is freaky.
-Come again?
- Freaky.
- Freaky?
- Yeah, freaky.
Have a chocolate.
Thank you.
Are you seriously going to deface your body just on the possibility you could have cheap sex with a girl you met in a bar?
Uh, yeah.
What is your mother going to say?
She's not gonna see it.
She takes my temperature orally now.
What are you gonna get?
Well, I can't really decide between a screaming devil this mean little skull, or Kermit the Frog.
-Kermit the Frog?
-You know:  "Heigh-ho, I'm on Howard's butt".
Get the mean little skull, and I'll see if I can make him smile.
Yeah, I'd like the mean little skull, please.
What are you gonna get, Raj?
With my luck, hepatitis.
Okay, here we go.
Ow, ow, ow.
That's just rubbing alcohol.
I know, but it was cold.
Ow, ow, ow.
I'm putting on the stencil.
-What comes after the stencil?
-This:   Aah!
Okay, that's it.
No needle.
No pain.
No tattoo.
What's the big deal?
You've done this before.
No, I haven't.
Look.
-I'm sorry.
I'm a fraud.
He's a fraud.
-We're both frauds.
-Yeah, I think I covered that.
-Well, I was summing up.
We're not goth.
We're just guys.
Very, very smart guys.
So you were totally scamming us?
Yes.
And I wouldn't blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again.
Unless, of course, our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.
Huh?
Huh?
Anything?
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving too.
Not that anyone cares.
When we tell this story, let's end it differently.
What are you thinking, maybe a big musical number?
Well, I'm going to make some warm milk and then turn in.
I trust if you two are planning on engaging in amorous activities you'll keep the decibel level to a minimum.
Of course.
Thank you.
Mm.
These are so good.
Mm.
Unbelievable.
-What?
-I was just thinking we should probably turn in too.
Well, my new bed got delivered.
If you put it together, you can stay at my place.
Really?
That's a lot of work, and it's late.
Yeah, but we won't have to be quiet.
Let's go.
Interesting.
Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behavior.
I wonder if anyone else has stumbled onto that.
Okay, wait, how about this?
We say there were four goth girls.
The two girls in the club had two friends.
I like it, I like it.
Did they smell good despite their goth-like nature?
-What's that gotta do with the story?
-Engaging my olfactory sense -helps make it real for me.
-Fine, they smelled good.
Oh, they did.
Like jasmine and honeysuckle.
-Whatever.
-And they held hands and did a sexy demonic hokey-pokey for us.
No.
Let me say my story all the way, and then you can say yours -then we'll pick.
-I'm sorry.
Go on.
We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.
We don't have tattoos.
What if someone asks to see our tattoos?
We say they're in a very intimate area.
Oh, we are bad boys, aren't we?
-Right.
Right.
-Yeah.
Ha, ha.
So we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.
But we just got tattoos.
Wouldn't we be concerned about bacterial infection?
True.
Okay, forget the hot tub.
The point is, we each had a mÃ©nage with sexy goth girls.
Wow.
What a great night.
Yeah.
Hey, wanna try a country bar tomorrow night?
Yeah, maybe we'll get lucky with sexy cowgirls.
-Could happen.
-Ha, ha.
I wonder how they smell.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
This movie baffles me every time we watch it.
What do you mean?
The instructions are very clear.
Don't feed the gremlins after midnight.
Don't get the gremlins wet.
How hard is that?
Hi, guys.
-Hi, honey.
-Hey.
Oh, we're "honey" now, are we?
Yes.
Since their relationship became carnal Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment distinguishing him from those she calls "sweetie" in an attempt to soften a thinly veiled insult.
You're boring people, sweetie.
Although sometimes she omits the veil entirely.
-So, what are you guys doing?
-Celebrating Columbus Day.
We're watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes.
They're all written by Chris Columbus.
Okay.
What do you watch on Thanksgiving?
The parade.
That reminds me.
I usually go back to Nebraska for Thanksgiving.
This year, they're calling it off on account of my brother's trial.
-What's he on trial for?
-Oh, just a big misunderstanding.
You know, you'd like my brother.
He's kind of a chemist.
I was thinking I'd have Thanksgiving here.
-And you are all invited.
-Oh, I'll be there.
Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
I guess I could serve both.
You guess?
You don't seem to have much of a handle on this.
Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.
Tur-briska-fil?
A turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish.
It's not as good as it sounds.
Raj, what about you?
Oh, he usually comes to my house.
Right, pal?
Uh, all right.
This year, you don't have to eat the tur-briska-fil.
I don't even chew it.
I swallow it like pills.
So, what's going on with Raj?
Well, the good news is he has no problem with my mother's tur-briska-fil.
Hard to believe, but go on.
The bad news is he says he's getting deported.
What do you mean he's getting deported?
I believe it means the U.S. government is going to expel him from the country.
He could return to India, immigrate to another country willing to accept him or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate.
Personally, I'd choose pirate.
Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?
Ugh.
Fine, but the man really needs to work on his girl issues.
Another reason to consider a life of piracy.
Even today, I understand that's an all-male profession.
Okay, she's gone.
Sorry I lost my cool.
So, what's going on?
Okay, here's the deal.
Six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.
So?
My visa is only good as long as I'm employed at the university.
When they find out I've got squat, they're gonna cut me off.
By the way, when I say "squat," I mean "diddlysquat".
I wish I had squat.
Wait.
What have you been doing for the past six months?
You know, checking e-mail updating my Facebook status messing up Wikipedia entries.
Did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?
You've continued to take the university's money under false pretenses?
Highly unethical for an astrophysicist.
Although, practically mandatory for a pirate.
I don't wanna go back to India.
It's hot and loud.
And there's so many people.
You have no idea.
They're everywhere.
Okay, guys, think.
How do we keep Raj in the country?
PENNY : Why doesn't he just get another job?
What are you asking me for?
I don't know if you can talk now or not.
Oh, beef.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Did you know at the Mumbai McDonald's, you can't get a Big Mac?
All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac.
And the special sauce?
Curry.
Which in India, believe you me, is really not that special.
-Don't worry.
You'll find another job.
-Yeah, let me start practicing for it.
"Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac"?
Hi, Leonard.
Hello, Raj.
Hello, Sheldon.
Forgive me.
I'm not adept at reading facial cues.
But I'm going to take a stab here.
You're either sad or nauseated.
-I'm sad.
-I was going to say sad.
I don't know why I hedged.
What are you eating?
Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
Oh, beefaroni.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
I've always been a little confused about this.
Why don't Hindus eat beef?
-We believe cows are gods.
-Not technically.
In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.
Do not tell me about my culture.
I'll take you out, I swear to cow.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
I'm just-- I'm a little on edge.
Mm, understandable.
Your life seems to be crumbling around you and your future appears bleak at best.
Thank you.
And you're wrong about Hinduism and cows.
Hey, Raj, Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join -the stellar evolution research team.
-You're kidding.
That's fantastic.
-Call him and set up an interview.
-I'm on it.
-That's happy, right?
-Yeah.
Nailed it.
Dr. Koothrappali, come on in.
I was surprised to hear you're interested in joining our team.
Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?
No, no.
It's a very promising area.
In a perfect world, I'd spend several more years on it.
I couldn't pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.
Splendid.
Please sit down.
Can I offer you a sherry?
It's a little early, isn't it?
Not on Proxima Centauri.
Ha, ha.
Oh, that's very good.
Jolly amusing.
But if you don't mind, I'll hold off until sunset on Titan.
Ha, ha.
Well done.
I have a feeling you're going to fit in fine, Dr. Koothrappali.
Thank you, sir.
I'm sorry.
Am I late?
No, no.
Right on time.
Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT.
She'll be heading up our data analysis team.
It's nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali.
I read your paper on Kuiper Belt object-size distribution.
I really enjoyed it.
How did you correct for the selection bias?
Well, I ran a simulation.
Allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.
-Oh.
That's just fascinating.
-Thank you.
Would you like to hear more about it at my hot tub?
So when do I start?
You didn't get the job?
How could you not get it?
You know, he's British, I'm Indian.
Ever since Gandhi, they haven't liked us very much.
Are you saying that he discriminated against you?
We should file a complaint.
That's okay.
Complaint's been filed.
So that's it.
That was my last hope.
I'm gonna be deported.
Sent home in disgrace.
Exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay.
Or as you may know him, Dave from AT&T Customer Service.
-I'm really gonna miss you.
-Will you come visit me in India?
Gee, that's like a 17-hour flight.
How about I meet you halfway?
Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.
Tell you what, we'll Skype.
-Gentlemen.
-Hey.
Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?
-No.
-I assumed as much, but never fear.
Like the subordinate male protagonist in action movies who disappears halfway through the second reel, I have returned to save the day.
Odd.
Usually he's met by cheers.
Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark-matter annihilations.
-It occurred to me that I could-- -Excuse me.
How many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?
If you didn't cheer at my entrance, it's too late to buy into the premise.
Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department and Raj can come work for me.
You want me to work with you?
For me.
You're going to have to listen more carefully when you're on the job.
Okay.
Please don't take this the wrong way but I'd rather swim buck naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.
For me.
Sheldon, are you busy?
Of course I'm busy.
-Shall I wait?
-Yes, please.
How may I help you?
I've reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
For me.
Yes, for you.
I do, however, have a few conditions.
First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal.
Second, my contributions shall be noted in published materials.
Third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.
I'm impressed, Raj.
Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.
-Thank you.
-I reject them all.
Then you leave me no choice.
I accept the job.
I'm sorry.
I believe you've misunderstood.
I'm not giving you the job.
I'm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it.
Have a seat.
We'll get started with the interview.
You're kidding.
Please.
All right.
So.
That's what you wear to an interview?
Come on, we've been friends for years.
Oh, pulling strings, are we?
Sheldon, for God's sakes, don't make me beg.
Buzzinga.
You've fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes.
I'm your boss now.
You may wanna laugh at that.
Ah.
This is nice, having the place to ourselves, isn't it?
Uh-huh.
Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don't have to chauffeur him around.
Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.
Mm-hm.
Hey.
Wanna get a little crazy?
What are you thinking?
Let's slide over to Sheldon's spot and make out.
You are a dirty girl.
Oh, God, how did he know?
Hello?
-Hi, Howard.
Heh.
Am I interrupting?
Little bit, yeah.
Guess I should've called.
Yeah, maybe.
Tonight's the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the Palomino.
Uh-huh.
But he's working with Sheldon.
-Yes.
We know.
Hoo.
Want me to leave?
You know, whatever.
I guess I can hang for a little while.
So, what are we watching?
Sex and the City, yikes.
Hey, I happen to love this movie.
Fine.
Let's watch it.
Maybe all our periods will synchronize.
We're going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark-matter collisions.
Ooh, dark matter.
We better bring a flashlight, ha, ha.
I was making a joke.
I'm the boss.
I make the jokes.
Sorry.
Go ahead and make your joke.
This is not the time for joking.
We're doing serious research which requires complete and utter focus.
All right.
Let's buckle down and work.
-Sheldon.
-What?
-I need an aspirin.
-Top desk drawer.
-Thank you.
-All right?
-Yes.
-Good.
That was fun, ha, ha.
Thank you.
Leonard, you don't have to say thank you every time we have sex.
Oh, okay.
Tomorrow, you're gonna get a card in the mail.
Just throw it away.
Top of the morning to you.
What are you doing here?
Well, usually on Sundays I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmer's market but he's still working with Sheldon.
So I thought I'd come over here and make scrambled eggs and salami.
It's the perfect meal for aprÃ¨s l'amour.
Kill me.
By the way, I couldn't help overhearing your big finish.
Bravo, Leonard.
See, if you had killed me when I said "kill me" I wouldn't have had to hear that.
What do you guys think?
Wanna take in a matinÃ©e?
Go rollerblading?
Catch a step class?
-Do something.
-Yeah.
Okay.
Um.
Howard, we need to talk.
Sure.
What's up, homes?
Please understand that it's not that we don't want you around.
But Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.
Oh.
I get it.
I'm the third wheel.
Heh.
Sorry, I should've seen that.
I'll get out of your way.
Uh, you're gonna wanna eat those eggs while they're still hot.
Thank you.
And there's lox and cream cheese in the fridge.
The bagels are in the oven.
I was warming them up.
That's great.
I'm just gonna hang out with my mom.
That's always fun.
Good.
-Are we terrible people?
-I don't know.
What do you want me to do?
Ahh.
Get him.
Bring him back.
You sure?
Yeah.
Okay.
Howard, come back.
Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.
No, no.
That rate is much too low from what we'd expect from this collision.
Do you understand we're talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?
Of course I understand.
And who are you to tell me about outer space?
Well, I'm the astrophysicist.
"Astro" means "space".
"Astro" means "star".
Let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I'd be kicking your butt.
English is your native language.
Okay, you got me there.
But you're wrong about this.
There's a fine line between wrong and visionary.
Unfortunately, you have to be a visionary to see it.
God, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold.
Let me tell you, some of those thoughts are pure caca.
Caca?
-It means "doo-doo".
-All right.
First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me-- Aha!
So I am working with you?
In this context, "with me" means "for me".
Oh.
Yeah, well, in this context:  All right.
If I'm wrong, prove it.
Okay.
Here's where we derived the mass of the dark-matter particle.
-You've misstated the weight.
-Let me finish.
-You're defacing my work.
-I'm not.
I'm fixing it.
-Give me the eraser.
-No.
I said give it to me.
Come and get it.
Fine.
Oh, Lord.
Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board.
-You are not my superior.
-I am in every way.
Oh, yeah?
Can you do this?
Nice working with you.
I'm sorry.
"For you".
Argh!
Raj?
Raj?
Raj?
I'm busy.
Doing what?
-You've made your point.
-What do you want, Sheldon?
I looked over the board, and it turns out you were right.
-You were wrong?
-I didn't say that.
-That's the only logical inference.
-I didn't say it.
Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.
For you or with you?
In this context, "for me" could mean "with me".
-I have conditions.
-I reject them all.
I'll take the job.
See you Monday.
-Wait.
You have to drive me home.
-How did you get here?
-I walked.
-So walk home.
I can't.
There's a big dog outside.
We can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector -for 500 GeV particles.
-All right.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
All right, Raj has played his Phantom Warlord card and I am going to back him up with my Strangling Vines.
Choke on that, sucker.
Okay.
Well, then I'll just cut your vines with my Ruby Sword.
That's right, I did it.
I cut them.
Um.
I have a question.
Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite and basically everything beats Enchanted Bunny.
Unless you have the Carrot of Power.
Okay, I've got another question.
When does this get fun?
Are we gonna talk or are we gonna play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?
Just play a potion card.
Which one?
It doesn't matter, you can't possibly win.
-Don't ruin the game.
-How could he ruin the game?
Given the cards already played, Penny can only be holding Necromancer Potions which are only effective against wraiths and daywalkers and there are no more left.
The cards remaining in the stack are: Four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the Jewel of Osiris.
See?
Ruined.
Sheldon, that is incredible.
From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.
Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
"Photographic" is a misnomer.
I have an eidetic memory, as I've told you many times.
Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of May 7th.
You had turkey and complained it was dry.
Well, I guess game's over.
Really?
Oh, great.
I mean, aww.
-Okay, I gotta go.
-Why?
Because last time I didn't go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.
Not "Ka".
Ka-ah.
-Bye.
-See you.
Still can't believe she's going out with me.
Nobody can.
That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you.
-What?
-You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends.
-Yeah, I don't remember that.
-Wha--?
June 30th, 2004.
Opening day of Spider-Man 2 at the AMC Pasadena.
They only had red ICEES, no blue.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you've been with Penny for like a month and a half.
Where's my shorty, Morty?
Howard, you can't hold me to that.
-Why not?
-When I made that agreement I didn't think I'd ever have a girlfriend, and I was positive you never would.
-How come I wasn't part of this deal?
-You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
So that's how it works?
I have a teeny bladder and I don't get a hot girlfriend?
Yeah, Raj, that's how it works.
Damn.
Oh, damn it.
Can I have a napkin?
I'm sorry, no.
But you have a whole bunch of them.
Yes, I've moved to a four-napkin system.
Lap, hands, face and personal emergency.
If you like, starting tomorrow I'll add a guest napkin but I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you today.
Good luck.
That's the face napkin.
-So have you talked to Penny yet?
-No, I haven't.
-Why not?
-Because I've been busy.
Because I haven't figured out a way to bring it up.
And mostly, and I can't stress how key this is because I don't want to.
A pact is a pact.
You have to get Penny to fix me up.
It's not that simple.
What am I supposed to say?
"Penny, you have any friends you'd like to never hear from again"?
Come on.
I'm smart, I have a good job.
And I have only 3 percent body fat.
It's true.
I've seen him at the beach.
He's like a human chicken wing.
Leonard, come on.
-Fine, I'll ask if she has a friend for you.
-A hot friend.
-Right.
-And tall.
I want our kids to be able to ride Space Mountain before they're 20.
I'll see what I can do.
Hey, guess what I heard today.
I'd imagine you heard any number of things today.
When you arrived at work, you undoubtedly heard: "Hello.
How are you, Raj"?
You're wearing a new sweater vest, you may have heard: "New sweater vest"?
And possibly, though less likely, "Nice sweater vest".
Why don't I just tell you what I heard today?
That would probably save us some time.
Saturday night at the comic-book store they're having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament.
First prize is $500.
-If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.
-I'm sorry, Raj.
I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.
-But what about the money?
-I have money.
But this is other money.
How does it differ from the money I have?
Half of it will be mine.
Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater vest?
-Leonard, help.
-Are you kidding?
I couldn't even talk him into giving me one of his freaking napkins.
Wow, you really are a genius.
Not really.
I Googled how to do that.
So listen.
Have you ever made a pact with someone?
You mean like a pinky swear?
Okay, fine.
Like a pinky swear.
In the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie.
-You know, from Sesame Street.
-I'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.
Then we found out we both wanted Ernie.
We didn't speak again till middle school.
Over puppets?
The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.
Okay.
Speaking of what the heart wants, um a long time ago I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.
Okay, I don't know where you're going with this but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.
No, no, nothing like that.
No, the deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend we'd have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.
You thought a good time to bring this up would be right after sex?
Well, I sure as hell wasn't gonna bring it up before sex.
And during I was trying to remember what I read on Google, so.
I'm not hooking Wolowitz up with my friends.
Come on, it doesn't have to be a good friend.
And you know that deep down inside, Howard's a really nice guy.
The problem isn't what's on the inside.
It's the creepy candy coating.
Will you at least think about it?
Just as a favor to me?
The great thing about Ernie was he never asked me for anything.
He just gave.
Got it.
Got it.
Got it.
Got it.
Got it.
Got it.
Betty and Veronica.
Oh.
Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine's coming in tomorrow.
-Want me to set one aside for you?
-Thank you.
You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
-All right, I won't.
-But I must have it.
-Okay, I'll set one aside for you.
-Thank you.
I can buy all these things online.
I come here for the personal service.
Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the Mystic Warlords Tournament the Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?
Yeah, he lives around here.
Big gamer.
Excuse me, are you saying that Wil Wheaton a.k.a. Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek: The Next Generation is participating in your tournament?
I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?
No, wait, you don't understand.
Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton.
You know, Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.
Oh, what a coincidence.
You can discuss that with him while playing in the tournament.
Sign here.
Yeah, I was such a fan that in 1995 I traveled 10 hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi wearing my Starfleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
Oh, it'll be like a reunion then.
Sign here.
Yeah, my arduous journey, however, was for naught.
Although advertised to appear, he did not show up.
It was at that moment I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.
Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him.
Sign here.
It might interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.
Okay, I get it.
He's a bad guy.
Sign here.
In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal Wrath of Khan: "He tasks me.
He tasks me and I shall have him".
-No doubt.
Sign here.
-"From hell's heart, I stab at thee".
All right, Raj.
Looks like you're teamed up with "Die, Wil Wheaton, die".
So tell me more about the future mother of my children.
She's adorable, Howard.
I think you'll like her.
Great.
What did you tell her about me?
Did you mention body fat?
No, I thought that'd be a nice surprise for her.
Good, good.
I told her you're an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages-- Six, if you count Klingon.
Girls don't count Klingon, Howard.
-Right?
-Right.
And I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.
-What?
-I'm kidding.
Another delightful surprise for her.
Sheldon, it's your play.
Sheldon.
My Enchanted Troll bludgeons your Screaming Harpy with a Cursed Mace.
Game.
Sorry, boys.
Say hi to your mother when she picks you up.
Or I could just tell her later tonight.
Ha-ha-ha.
We pawned them, dude.
Up top.
Look at him.
Wil Wheaton, my old friend.
I have chased you around the moons of Nibia and around the Antares Maelstrom, and around Perdition's flames.
You keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in Next Generation.
-It's a totally different set of characters.
-Silence.
How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
If Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat Lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round we'll face off for championship.
So my path to satisfaction is blocked by Lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants.
Very well, they must be destroyed.
Dude, you have to stop talking like that.
It's really lame.
Silence.
So Penny tells me you're working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school.
That's great.
-What are you studying?
-Microbiology.
Oh, cool.
So you could study me.
I don't understand.
Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.
I know, I'm studying it.
Yeah, and I said you could study me because I'm a tiny living thing.
-It's a joke.
-Are you sure?
-Do you like science fiction?
-No.
-Role-playing games?
-Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?
-Either.
-No.
You like?
-It's gonna be a long night.
-Yeah, well, it's your fault.
-I had to ask, you didn't have to say yes.
You like magic?
-Not really.
-Okay.
Long, long night.
I play my Endless Serpent, Raj will play Ecstatic Frenzy which means Larry will have to play Chaos Overlord.
Then Captain Sweatpants, Molten River.
I play Nightshade Dryad.
Game, set and match.
Now fetch me Wil Wheaton.
Did that guy just say, "Revenge is a dish best served cold," in Klingon?
I believe so.
What is wrong with him?
Everyone has a different theory.
How about computers?
You like computers?
I use them.
I don't like them.
Okay.
Puppies.
Where do you stand on puppies?
A puppy once bit my face.
Of course it did.
-How about that?
Einstein was wrong.
-What?
Approaching the speed of light doesn't slow down time, approaching them does.
Excuse me.
Oh, damn.
It's my mother.
-Are you going to answer it?
-I'm torn.
She might be dying and, you know, wouldn't want to miss that.
On other hand, if let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.
I know how you feel.
My mother makes me crazy.
Yeah, not as crazy as my mother makes me.
Yeah?
Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you've had a healthy lunch?
My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.
Okay, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you're 9 years old?
-You live with your mother?
-No.
That's the sad part.
Rough.
Okay, check this out.
My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn't pick up a disease from the other children.
That's nothing.
I couldn't ride a bicycle because my mother was afraid I'd hit a bump and lose my virginity.
Oh, wow, you didn't, did you?
Not on a bicycle.
In a Camry.
A Corolla.
-More wine?
-I'd love some.
Listen, you have to come to Shabbat dinner at my house sometime.
Why?
A Catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I've been hoping for.
Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.
It's a date.
Am I a matchmaker or what?
Lava Serpent.
Nest of Snakes.
-Underworld Guardian.
-Underworld Guardian.
We skirmish to the death.
-Invisibility Spell.
-Luminescence Spell.
-Water nymph.
-Fire demon.
-Two-headed tiger.
-Three-headed lion.
-Sulfur.
-Brimstone.
Problem, Wil Wheaton?
Hang on.
You're holding two moderate spell cards, a Small Rock and a Potion of Zancor which will be as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth.
Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish and two moves later, the game.
-I think he's got me.
-The year was 1995.
The place, Jackson, Mississippi.
Having spent 10 hours on a bus during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself onboard a moving vehicle I finally arrived at the Fourth Annual Dixie Trek Convention only to find that my idol, Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than show up and sign my action figure.
What?
You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton.
Now I have my revenge.
You went to the '95 Dixie Trek?
Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.
Your memaw died?
That's terrible.
Yeah.
It was.
But I'm really sorry that I disappointed you.
No, no, I understand.
If anything happened to my memaw, I'd be one inconsolable Moon Pie.
I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me Moon Pie.
It's a special relationship, isn't it?
Between a boy and his grandmother.
-Oh, yes.
Yeah, okay.
Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas.
Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off.
Yeah.
It's okay, Sheldon.
I let you down.
I deserve it.
Potion of Zancor.
What are you waiting for?
Kill Wil Wheaton.
From hell's heart, stab at him.
-I can't.
-Sure you can.
Do it.
Do it.
No.
I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams.
But I can't defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his memaw.
-Enchanted Bunny.
-No!
Not Enchanted Bunny!
I call my memaw "nana".
And she's gonna be very happy to hear that my Small Rock kills your Enchanted Bunny.
Game over, Moon Pie.
I don't understand.
Your grandmother's alive?
Oh, you catch on quick.
Come on, Stewie, let's get our prize money.
That was fun.
Wheaton!
Wheaton!
Wheaton!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
-Kites ho!
-Kites ho!
Kites ho!
Kites ho!
Excuse me.
You're misusing the word "ho".
It's an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object.
As in, uh, "Land ho"!
or, uh, "Westward ho"!
Kites ho!
Hey, guys.
What are you doing?
Going out to discover electricity?
If you refer to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity.
He merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity.
He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter.
-Kites ho.
-We're heading out for some kite fighting.
-Kite fighting?
-Oh, yeah.
It's an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.
Well, actually, the risk of throat-cutting is very low.
On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-present danger.
-Uh, you wanna come watch?
-Oh, gee, ha, sounds amazing.
But, um, I've got some friends coming over.
We're just gonna watch the Nebraska game.
Oh, football, sure.
Good guess.
I would've invited you, but you're not a fan.
No.
No, I'm not.
So, great.
You've got plans doing something you like I've got plans doing something I like, so it's good.
Maybe we'll hang out after everybody's gone.
-Yeah, great.
-See you.
Well, this sucks.
I'm sorry, I got bored and drifted off.
Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?
Leonard realized Penny's hiding him from her friends because he's a tiny little man who flies kites.
Oh, that certainly would suck.
Wolowitz is trying to outflank us.
Let out some string, add altitude, I'll go under and cut his line.
Why wouldn't Penny want her friends to meet me?
Focus, Leonard, focus.
The heat of battle is upon us.
The dogs of war are unleashed.
Maybe Koothrappali's right, maybe I embarrass her.
You're embarrassing me.
A grown man worrying about such nonsense.
We're in the middle of flying kites.
-Sorry.
-Sorry won't bring their kites down.
Ouch!
String burn.
String burn.
Oh, they think we're flanking.
They're playing right into our hands.
At the count of three, we execute the flying scissor.
-One, two, thre-- -Whoa.
-You see that?
-See what?
-That chick.
She smiled at me.
-No, she didn't.
-She did.
-Come on, scissors, scissors.
-Hold my line.
-What?
I can't scissors by myself.
Howard, come back!
Victory!
Son of a bitch.
You're a sucky friend, you know that?
A sucky, sucky friend.
What was I supposed to do?
She gave me that come-hither look.
If she gave you any look at all, it was a you-suck look.
I would've caught up to her if I hadn't pulled a hammy.
Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds, you don't have a hammy.
So Penny doesn't want me around her friends.
I embarrass her.
What else?
Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings.
Perhaps she's excluded you from these gatherings because she's scouting for a new mate and doesn't wanna do it in front of you.
Oh, how kind of her.
Agreed.
Most primates don't show that sort of discretion.
A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a, "How do you do"?
You always do this.
Ditch me for a woman you don't have a shot with.
-I totally had a shot.
-With a woman you were chasing in a park.
That's not a shot, that's a felony.
What's worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite.
I don't suppose there's any chance you could give me my kite back?
I'm sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate that the fallen kite go to the victor.
And without rules, the competition has no meaning.
And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture:  I have your kite, I have your kite  -Hey.
-Hi.
How was your football party?
-It was pretty good, we won.
-Oh, wow, that's excellent.
Weird figure of speech, isn't it?
"We won," when you weren't actually playing.
When we watch Star Wars, we don't say, "We defeated the Empire".
Ha, ha.
I'm glad to hear it.
Oh, hey, on a related subject are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?
Oh, my God, no.
Why would you ask that?
Well, you know, I just noticed I haven't really met any of them.
-Sure you have.
-Well, yeah, no.
I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller-yet-still-larger-than-me ex-boyfriend.
By the way, were they here today?
-Of course not.
-Why would they?
Why would I ask?
Why am I rambling?
Why don't you stop me?
Leonard, look, if you wanna meet my friends, that would be great.
I just-- You know, I didn't want you to be bored.
I wouldn't be bored.
Why would I be bored?
Well, because they're not genius scientists.
Penny, I like all sorts of people.
In fact, some of my best friends aren't geniuses.
Like who?
Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren't geniuses.
But-- My point is, if we're gonna be a couple -I should be friends with your friends.
-Okay, great.
Why don't you come over next Saturday and watch the game?
Another football game?
They have them every week.
Did not know that.
-You wanted to meet my friends.
-Sure.
Just-- I don't know much about football.
The guys' girlfriends don't know football.
They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.
Great.
COMMENTATOR : Looking left, he's got nothing.
-He drops off a screen, out of bounds-- -Okay, a completed pass.
First down, New England.
-I think I'm starting to get this.
-Really?
The only thing I've learned is that American men love drinking beer pee too often, and have trouble getting erections.
Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.
If people cut back on the beer, you could get out the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.
Raj, what are you doing here?
You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.
Are you under the impression that we're still friends?
Ugh.
Come on, you're not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?
It's not just the kite thing.
Every time we go someplace, you dump me whenever someone pretty comes even though you don't have a shot.
I had a shot with that jogger.
Fine.
Paint green flames on your little scooter with her.
It's not a little scooter.
It's the second-biggest Vespa they make!
You're watching football?
There's no fooling you.
Now, what is this "sacks" statistic they put up there?
All I know about Saks is my mother shops there.
Sacks, sacks.
It's football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
Huh.
Scrimmage.
The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offense from the defense.
Oh.
Sheldon knows football?
-Apparently.
-I mean, Quidditch, sure.
But football?
-Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?
-I grew up in Texas.
Football is ubiquitous in Texas.
There's pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football.
In fact, every form of football except the original, European football.
Which most Texans believe to be a commie plot.
-Unbelievable.
-If interested I also know all about frying meat that isn't chicken as if it were chicken.
So you could teach me?
Football or chicken-fried meats?
Football.
I'm going to Penny's to watch a game with her friends.
I don't wanna look like an idiot.
I wanna blend in.
If you wanna blend in I'd think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.
Sheldon, teach me football.
It'll be fun.
That's exactly what my father said.
"Come to the games.
Watch the games".
Week in and week out, from the time I was 5 until I went off to college.
Longest seven years of my life.
Please, I'm asking you as a friend.
Are you making this a tier-one friendship request?
-Yes.
-Fine.
-I really appreciate this.
-Yeah, yeah.
All right, poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.
I'm sorry?
Oh, that's how my father always began our football conversations.
And if you'd like, after the game, I'll teach you how to shoot close enough to a raccoon that it craps itself.
When are you gonna stop making Cylon toast?
When I have enough to destroy the human toast on the Battlestar known as Galactica.
Is that what you're wearing to watch football?
-What's wrong with a football jersey?
-Nothing.
That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.
It's the smallest size they had.
Except the one for dogs.
I can't believe they had one for dogs.
Oh, yes.
Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas.
Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel.
My sister found that out the hard way.
-Anyway, wish me luck.
-Leonard, wait.
Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?
Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way.
How would you put it?
Yeah, okay, like you said.
Huh.
Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse.
Don't you have access to women who will do it for money?
By the way, another accepted usage for the term "ho".
Goodbye, Sheldon.
Now, hold on.
I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-handed.
Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in, not get laughed at.
What's funny about Cylon toast?
It's open.
Hey, pal.
What do you want?
I brought you a little gift.
New kite.
The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang.
An Indian kite my brother sent to me from New Delhi.
It took me a day to put together and two days to paint.
This is Hello Kitty.
Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse.
Does a Patang?
Wow, you just don't get it, do you?
Buying me something pretty isn't gonna make our problem just go away.
Look, I admit I haven't always been the best friend I could be.
You've been a sucky friend.
A sucky, sucky friend.
-Stipulated.
-And you do it all the time.
Last week, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother -and I realize you're not even there.
-I know.
And where were you?
Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick.
But in my defense, she was gorgeous.
And working that squeezer to make the lemonade going up and down and up and down.
It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.
You're impossible.
Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk.
Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder.
You're just a douche.
No.
You know what?
Maybe that's what this whole thing is about.
You're not mad at me.
You're mad at yourself.
No, I'm mad at you.
I hate myself, but I'm mad at you.
Look, fine.
You're mad at me.
I get it.
Now-- How about we go spend the day together?
Just the two of us.
We'll go anywhere you want.
I don't know.
Come on.
Let me take you someplace nice.
I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.
Really?
Now?
With the traffic and the parking?
It-- Okay, fine.
The Tar Pits.
Let's go.
Oh, why can't I stay mad at you?
-Yeah.
-Ha-ha-ha.
COMMENTATOR : Breaks tackle.
-Go, go.
He breaks another.
-Go!
Yes!
Are you people watching this?
Is this amazing or what?
Sweetie, that's a highlight from the '98 championship game.
Oh.
Did not know that.
Ha.
-How much beer have you had?
-None, why?
Oh.
Just kind of hoping you were drunk.
-Now we're back live.
-Okay, yeah.
No, I can see the difference.
-That's intentional grounding.
-Totally.
Yeah-- That completely was a forward pass which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time.
I can't believe they're not penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.
-Here.
Have some pizza, sweetie.
-Penny, you know I'm lactose intolerant.
I know.
I just need you to stop talking.
Penny.
Penny.
Penny.
-Sheldon, come in.
-Thank you.
I'd like to make a sandwich, but I'm out of bread.
-There's some in the fridge.
-You shouldn't keep bread in the fridge.
Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch which occurs faster at cool temperatures.
On Earth, we say, "Thank you".
So, Leonard, how goes the mimesis?
-Mimesis?
-You know, mimesis.
An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism.
Mimesis.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you.
Let me try again.
Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own?
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
Oh, I guess so.
Good.
Oh, FYI, after I eat my sandwich I'm taking Koothrappali's Patang kite out for a test run.
Would you get your Delta Wing Raptor and join me?
I don't wanna fly kites, Sheldon.
Come on, we're watching football here.
I can see that.
I was providing you with an alternative.
A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
Oh, look at that.
The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he's challenging the ruling on the field.
Hope he's right, because if he's not, it'll cost him one of his three timeouts.
You know, Leonard, honey I wouldn't mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.
I'll watch the end of the game.
There's three minutes left.
Until halftime.
This is just half?
We've been here for hours.
-You're gonna be here for a couple more.
-Oh, you're kidding.
-No.
-Nice meeting all of you.
So, yeah, anyway, that's my boyfriend.
He is really smart.
I really like my saber-toothed cat.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
Maybe after lunch we can go to Marie Callender's and have some pie.
-I'd like that.
-Heh.
This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.
Good, I'm glad.
Oh, man.
Did you see the way she smiled at me?
Fine.
Go ahead.
No.
This is our day.
If you wanna chase after her, chase after her.
Oh, who am I kidding?
I wouldn't have a shot with a girl like that.
Don't put yourself down.
You're very attractive.
-You think so?
-Yeah.
It wouldn't kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then but you have a certain wiry appeal.
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter, because she wasn't really smiling at me.
In this case, I think she was.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Bye.
What a douche.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.
Oh.
Research Lab is more than a game.
It's like the slogan says: "The physics is theoretical, but the fun is real".
We must not be playing it right.
All right.
Five.
One, two, three, four, five.
Oh, wow, look at that.
My Department of Defense research grant is renewed.
Oh.
Great roll.
Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large hadron collider.
Yay.
You're a natural at this, Penny.
And as the first beta testers, you two have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.
Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don't think we can play on Sunday.
Why not?
Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you.
Penny?
I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.
There you go.
She has to pick up her friend Justin.
And I can't play because I'm going with her.
Right?
Uh, yeah, if you want.
There may not be room.
He's got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
My friend Justin.
Pay attention, Leonard.
That's why she can't play on Sunday.
-Who is this Justin?
-Your turn.
-I told you about him.
-Roll the dice.
Yeah.
My friend from Omaha, plays the guitar.
He's coming looking for session work.
So I told him he could crash on my couch.
Come on.
Roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown.
See what I mean when I say the fun is real?
Hang on.
Some guy is gonna be sleeping on your couch?
He's not some guy.
He's my friend.
So by friend, do you mean "friend" friend gay friend, or "ex-boyfriend you're now platonic with but still might have a thing for you" friend?
Well, he's definitely not gay.
Oh.
A definitely-not-gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend's couch.
Yippie.
Okay, we went out a little bit a long time ago.
But we were never, like, going out.
Okay.
Not to be pedantic, the last I checked "went out" was the past tense of "going out" which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.
I'll just roll for you.
You have a problem with Justin staying with me?
What was your first clue?
Uh-oh.
Industrial accident.
Know what?
Don't talk to me like an idiot.
I'm not talking to you like an idiot.
I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic.
"You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser.
Lose one turn and a retina".
How's that not talking to me like I'm an idiot?
It's my friend, it's my couch and it's my freaking life.
It's also your roll.
You know what?
It is your life.
If you wanna have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, fine!
Why don't you just rent bunk beds and invite the Black Eyed Peas?
Hey, if I wanna invite the line-up of Lollapalooza to my apartment, I will.
It's none of your business.
Do you know how childish you sound right now?
-Oh, now I'm a child.
Not an idiot anymore.
-Hey, the two aren't mutually exclusive.
Oh, you are such a--  -What the hell is he doing?
-Drowning us out.
He doesn't like fighting.
Sheldon, just stop.
Look, the fight is over.
Oh, and FYI.
You never even heard of the Black Eyed Peas until you met me.
I heard of them.
I didn't know they were a band.
Sheldon, she's gone.
You can turn off the blender.
Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
No, we just had a little spat.
Look on the bright side.
As a result of Penny's forfeit you have become the world's first winner of Research Lab.
Would you like a commemorative snow cone?
I don't get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is gonna sleep on her couch.
Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.
I don't wanna play a game, Sheldon.
It's called Scientists.
Now, I will name three scientists you'll put them in order of the size of their contribution to their fields.
To make this game even more compelling you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field not the validity of the field itself.
For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology.
Okay.
Ready to have some fun?
An old boyfriend who's "definitely not gay".
You know, that's what a guy likes to hear.
"Definitely".
All right, I'll start with an easy one.
Um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.
And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy.
Hint.
Madame Curie had her husband to help her.
What am I supposed to say?
"Sure, Penny.
I'm cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment".
"It doesn't matter if you're cool or not.
Because I'm Penny, I'm pretty and I can do whatever I want".
"You think you're doing a favor by being in a relationship with me".
"No.
I'm doing you a favor by being in the same room as you".
Leonard, stop the car.
What?
I can't listen to the two of you fight anymore.
-Come on.
We're late.
-Calm down.
We'll make the movie.
I believe my alarm is appropriate.
The movie starts in 17 minutes.
We'll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard.
Plus, skip the concession stand and pre-show urination.
Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.
Go.
Go, Power Rangers, go.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-We're, uh, going to the movies.
-No, we're not.
We're standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.
Hang on.
They're showing a digital Time Bandits.
You wouldn't wanna come, would you?
Not really, no.
All right.
Invitation pointlessly offered, declined as expected.
Everyone's civil, nobody's fighting.
Have a nice evening.
Just give us a minute?
Take all the time you need.
So are we gonna talk about last night?
-Are you ready to apologize?
-No.
Ehh!
Wrong answer.
But thank you for playing.
Come on.
This is stupid.
Oh, there it is again.
You think I'm stupid.
No.
There's a difference between being and acting stupid.
Oh, yeah?
Well, there's a difference between being a jerk and being an ass.
No, there isn't.
They're synonyms.
Well, that was rather unpleasant.
Yeah.
I don't think I need my pre-show urination anymore.
Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her.
Now look, we are late for the movies.
Hey, look Amazing Spider-Man 193.
Got it.
Remember this one?
Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him.
You want me to get it for you?
It will help take your mind off things.
Hey, guys.
What's going on?
Ah, we need to kill a couple hours until the next showing.
Oh, well, no problem.
I was thinking of closing early, and going home but let's face it, that's just a smaller lonely room filled with comic books.
Thanks, Stuart.
Let me ask you.
Do you think it's okay to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?
-She's obviously way out of line.
-Thank you.
But if she dumps you, she'll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow and you'll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one.
So the only question is, how long until you fold?
I am not gonna fold.
Well, excuse me.
I don't think Penny's out of line.
You don't own her.
It's like my girl BeyoncÃ© says: "If you like it, you should've put a ring on it".
At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it -she should've backed off.
-Like when a guy's upset his friend agreed to take a class with him and then doesn't because he's doing a juice fast with his mother?
I didn't know you were upset about that.
Really?
Did you miss the subtle indicators?
Like me saying, "Howard, I am upset".
Okay, sorry.
-Maybe it's different in this country.
Back in India, it means you're upset with a guy named Howard.
-I said I'm sorry.
-Sorry doesn't make up for the fact I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy.
Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is?
Rice.
You think I was having fun?
Sitting around listening to my mother say:  "Have you ever peed so much in your life"?
Oh, my God.
You are such a mama's boy.
Don't bring my mother into this!
-You brought your mother into this!
Stop it!
Both of you!
This fighting, I might as well be back with my parents.
"I told you if you didn't quit drinking, I'd leave you".
"I guess that makes you a liar.
I'm drunk as hell and you're still here".
"Stop yelling.
You're making Sheldon cry".
"I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry.
That I let you name him Sheldon".
Boy, what got him so upset?
Oh, sure.
You can tell when Sheldon's upset.
Oh.
Thank you very much.
Come back soon.
With the other half of my tip.
Hey, Sheldon.
What're you doing here?
This is a restaurant.
It's lunchtime.
I'd think as a waitress you'd be familiar with the paradigm.
-Is Leonard coming?
-No.
I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come back to him and apologize.
-Well, that's not gonna happen.
-I assumed that.
-Hence my true purpose in coming here.
-Which is?
I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
-I'm busy.
-Excuse me, miss.
I'd like to order lunch.
-Fine.
What do you want?
-I have a few questions.
First, I notice that you offer soup and a half sandwich.
-Yes.
-Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from?
Are you giving me half of someone else's sandwich?
Or do I have to wait for someone else to order the other half?
No.
Sheldon, they just make a half sandwich.
You can't make a half sandwich.
If it's not half of a whole sandwich, it's just a small sandwich.
Okay, fine.
It's soup and a small sandwich.
-Is that what you want?
-Of course not.
I'll have my usual.
-Great.
-Aren't you gonna ask -if I want a beverage?
-Usually lemonade?
-Yes.
-Want lemonade?
-Yes.
-Anything else?
Yes.
I want you to apologize to Leonard.
I am not going to apologize.
I've done nothing.
He's overreacting.
Irrelevant.
The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn't about you.
I don't follow.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Look, Sheldon, I have to go.
All right.
Let's assume ad arguendum, that in this case Leonard is wrong.
-Leonard is wrong.
-Considering the transgressions you committed that he's overlooked don't you think that you could return the favor?
I'm coming.
Goodbye, Sheldon.
What do you mean transgressions I've committed?
Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?
Like what?
Yeah, yeah, I see you.
You're making a check sign in the air.
Got it.
Just hold your horses.
-What does Leonard complain about?
-Your driving.
The stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities.
Your constant tardiness, your singing.
-My singing?
-That's from my list.
Leonard'd be a fool if he didn't agree with it.
Okay, if Leonard has problems with me, why hasn't he just said so?
According to him, you're over-sensitive and have a temper.
Oh, really?
Well, then do me a favor and tell Leonard that he can drop dead.
And she wonders why she's constantly under-tipped.
-Hey.
-Oh, good, you're home.
-I need you to do me a favor.
-Sure.
-Go apologize to Penny.
-What?
Right now would be good.
Leonard!
-A few minutes ago would've been better.
I hear you don't like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.
Who would tell you something like that?
Why would you tell her something like that?
It doesn't matter why he told me.
It's true, isn't it?
Okay, yeah, it's true.
But I can live with that stuff.
What I can't live with is you casually informing me some guy is gonna be staying without asking me first.
That isn't even your problem.
Problem is you don't trust me.
Oh, come on.
Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don't trust Penny?
Sheldon?
Where did he go?
Ugh.
Your yelling must've freaked him out again.
Where are you going?
You just walk away in the middle of an argument?
No.
I'm gonna find your roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something.
Why didn't you say so?
Now I need your permission for that too?
I can't read your mind, Penny.
Really?
Why not?
You're so smart and I'm so dumb!
Raj.
Raj.
Raj.
Stop knocking.
It's open.
Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture.
I can't come for my cousin Sanjay's wedding.
Ask our son what we're supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Chaudri whose daughter, Lakshmi, is flying in for the sole purpose of meeting him.
I didn't ask you to set me up.
-You should be thanking us.
-Yes, Lakshmi got her stomach stapled.
You have an opportunity to get in with her before she loses weight and her self-esteem goes up.
I don't care.
And why don't you think I can find a woman for myself?
You're 27, the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law is that Jewish boy, Howard.
Oh, that is completely below the belt.
Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends.
Sheldon?
Howard and I are just friends.
Fine.
I'll come home for Sanjay's wedding.
Sheldon.
What are you doing?
He's not a lost dog.
Hey, why don't you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?
The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn't.
-What stop sign?
-Eyes on the road.
Eyes on the road!
MRS.
Howard, answer the door!
I'm busy!
I'm busy too!
You answer it!
MRS.
I can't!
I'm on the toilet!
God's sake, I don't need to hear that!
Can't you just say, "I'm busy"?
MRS.
I said, "I'm busy," but that wasn't good enough for you!
I hope it's one of those home invasion deals and they shoot me in the head.
MRS.
Well, if it's a home invader, don't tell them I'm on the toilet!
There's no one there.
You're hearing things, you crazy old lady.
Hey, Stuart.
Have you seen Sheldon?
Yeah.
He's, uh, over in the graphic novel section.
Built himself a little nest.
Thank you.
-Uh, Penny.
-Yeah?
-Is everything okay?
-What do you mean?
Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard are having a fight.
Oh, yeah, kind of.
It's no big thing.
Oh, good.
Good.
I love you.
I'm not leaving until you talk to me.
-Hey, what's going on?
-It's a little hard to explain.
He pretends he's in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we're in, but he can't perceive us.
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm just ignoring you.
All right, come on, Sheldon, let's go home.
We're done fighting.
I've heard that before.
Then the next thing you know, I'm hiding in my bedroom blaring a Richard Feynman lecture, Mom shouting Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad's meat loaf.
And my dad's on the roof skeet shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.
Okay, there's gonna be no more shouting and no skeet shooting.
Really?
Where's your friend Justin going to sleep?
-Yeah, where is he gonna sleep?
-Oh, my God, would you let this go?
I'd let it go.
Why should I let it go?
Why don't you just tell the guy to find a place to sleep?
Oh, for God sakes.
So you have childhood issues.
We all have childhood issues.
At some point, you just need to grow up and get past them.
Fire.
Fire.
Leonard, let me handle this.
Please?
-Fire, fire.
-Look, let-- She--   Sheldon, please try and understand.
Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship and occasionally we're gonna fight.
But no matter what happens between us, we will always love you.
Right, Leonard?
Always is a long time.
Sure.
Always.
You know, how about we buy you this robot and then we all go home?
I want that one.
Okay, you can have that one.
Oh, come on.
He's just gonna play with it twice and then it'll end up in his closet with all the other junk.
Buy him the robot, Leonard.
-Can I get this comic book too?
-Yes, you can.
We meet again.
So, what did Justin say when you told him he couldn't sleep on your couch?
He's a musician.
He'll sleep in his own vomit if he has to.
I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
How much time do we have?
Uh, T-minus five hours, Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west.
That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93.
-Anything yet?
-Uh, we have a signal -but no frame lock.
-Hang on.
How about now?
We did it.
Ha, ha.
We have the West Coast feed of HBO.
Ooh, Real Sex.
Big deal.
Every time I watch that it's old women putting condoms on cucumbers.
All right, let's see what's on the East Coast feed.
Oh, hey.
Dune.
Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert.
Too bad Sheldon couldn't come with us.
It's just not the same without him.
That was good.
That was good.
Oh, this sucks.
I'm switching back to Real Sex.
Sheldon's log.
Stardate 63345.3.
While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower I've remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states.
Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship.
And good evening to you, Siam Palace.
This is Sheldon Cooper.
I'm going to be dining alone this evening so I'll be reducing my usual order.
I'd like to start with one quarter of the Assorted Appetizers Plate and one half of the Golden Treasure for two-- Oh, for heaven's sake.
In the mid-18th century King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe to preserve his throne.
Surely you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.
Sheldon, help!
I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on Yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.
Penny.
Penny.
Penny.
Come in!
Hurry!
-Penny?
I'm back here.
Penny.
Penny.
Penny.
Oh, for God's sakes, I'm in the bathroom.
Shall I come back at a better time?
Get in here!
Hurry!
Don't you dare knock.
Hello.
I slipped in the shower.
I think I dislocated my shoulder.
Not surprising.
You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.
What?
Tubs are slippery.
I know.
I slipped.
I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.
Whatever.
Will you just turn the water off and help me up?
They're holding umbrellas.
-Unh.
-What?
-The ducks in my tub.
Unh.
Uh-huh.
They're whimsical, because ducks have neither a need for nor the ability to use umbrellas.
Oh, my God.
I gotta go to the emergency room.
Assuming you're correct that your humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would think so.
-Can you drive me?
-I don't drive.
Well, I can't drive.
Well, it seems we've reached an impasse.
Ow!
I could call you a cab or an ambulance.
No, no, no, I can't wait that long.
You gotta help me.
Please?
All right.
Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.
No one's saying that.
Let's go.
It does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks we both might die in a fiery car crash.
I wish Penny didn't have to work.
She loves camping.
That would've been great.
You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus.
Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby.
Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle-school teachers who reek of desperation.
-Wonderful.
How old are they?
-I don't know, 50, 55?
Oh, menopause.
Heh.
Nature's birth control.
Come on.
You guys can't be that hard up.
-I am.
-Yeah, me too.
Look, they gave me homemade cookies.
Of course they did.
That's what grandmothers do.
-So, what are we waiting for?
-Relax.
I said we'd stop by a little later, after they have their nap.
-Good idea.
They'll be refreshed.
Yeah.
-Cookie?
-Thank you.
Mmm.
-Mm.
Not bad.
-Yeah, very tasty.
Tell me more about these teachers.
Not much to tell.
They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead T-shirts.
Huh.
Hm.
Good cookies.
I see no organizational system in here whatsoever.
Which panties do you wear on Mondays?
I don't need panties.
I just need shorts and a shirt.
Mother always told me one should wear clean underpants -in case one is in an accident.
-One was already in an accident.
Doesn't mean one won't be in another, especially if I drive.
-Clothes, Sheldon.
I need clothes.
-Okay.
-Here.
-Seriously?
Those shorts with that top?
All right.
No.
No.
Oh, that's cute.
We should have you checked for a concussion.
Okay, now you gotta help me put these on.
-All right.
-But don't look.
-Don't look?
-I don't want you to see me naked.
Oh.
Well, that's understandable.
You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology.
Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa -Orpheus and Eurydice-- -Great.
They always look.
It never ends well.
You gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.
Okay.
Is that my arm?
Doesn't feel like an arm.
Then maybe you should let it go.
Alrighty.
Stars are pretty, aren't they?
Up above the world so high.
Like little diamonds in the sky.
That's beautiful, dude.
You should write that down before someone steals it.
So when do the meteors get here?
The meteors don't get here.
The Earth is moving into their path.
I can feel it.
I can feel the Earth moving.
Heh.
It's moving too fast.
Raj, slow it down.
Okay, how's that?
Better, thanks.
Stars are pretty, aren't they?
What's so funny?
It's your American accent.
Everything you say sounds stupid.
Ha-ha-ha.
"Stars are pretty, aren't they"?
For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.
-You have your learner's permit, right?
-Yes.
And I've logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator.
-Good.
-Didn't work out well.
-All right.
Can we go?
-One moment.
According to my Driver's Ed book, the side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the driver's door handle is visible in the lower right corner.
There's the handle.
Back.
Too far.
Bringing it back.
Optimized.
Ahem.
Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger-side mirror?
It's right there.
Where is the passenger-side mirror?
In a parking lot in Hollywood.
-Now, can we please go?
-Yes.
Soon as I adjust my seat.
Whee!
Oh, dear.
I'm gonna have to start again.
If I could speak the language of rabbits they would be amazed and I would be their king.
I hate my name.
It has "nerd" in it.
Leon-nerd.
I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.
I would be kind to my rabbit subjects.
At first.
You know what's a cool name?
Angelo.
That has "angel" and "Jell-O" in it.
It was my Uncle Murray's funeral.
We were all back at my Aunt Barbara's house.
Our eyes locked over the pickled herring.
We never meant for it to happen.
One day, I hold a great ball for the president of France.
But the rabbits, they hate me and don't come.
I'm embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch.
People could call me Angie.
"Yo, Angie.
How's it going"?
To this day, I can't look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed.
Oh, cousin Jeanie.
Could you please drive a little faster?
Oh, I think we're going sufficiently fast.
-What's that?
-Nothing.
-The engine does that sometimes.
-It can't be nothing.
The "check engine" light is on.
We need a service station.
The light's been on since I bought the car.
All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.
It's not gonna explode.
Just keep driving.
Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.
Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise.
He was the science officer.
I guarantee that if he saw the Enterprise's "check engine" light blinking he would pull the ship over immediately.
Oh, God, I'm gonna lose the arm.
Oop.
Red light.
Release accelerator and slowly apply the brake.
Nailed it.
While we have a moment -may I ask you a question?
-What?
Why do you have the Chinese character for "soup" tattooed on your right buttock?
-It's not "soup".
It's "courage".
-No, it isn't.
I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.
How did you see it?
You said you wouldn't look.
Sorry.
As I told you, the hero always peeks.
-Anything?
-No, that was the last pudding cup.
No.
What about Slim Jims?
That's what he used to eat his pudding, remember?
Right.
That was so good.
Sweetie and meaty at the same time.
Wait, wait, wait.
So you're saying we're out of food?
The only thing in here are blue-ice packs.
I know they're poison but they look like big, yummy Otter Pops.
-Oh, God, I am so hungry.
-Me too.
Check and see if we have any more pudding.
Okay.
All right.
There's no need to bark at me.
According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk you're after the man who claims to be having a heart attack but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone.
We have to fill these out.
"Describe illness or injury".
I dislocated my shoulder.
All right.
And "how did the accident occur"?
You already know that.
Cause of accident: lack of adhesive ducks.
Okay, medical history.
-Have you been diagnosed with diabetes?
-No.
-Kidney disease?
-No.
-Migraines?
-Getting one.
-Are you currently pregnant?
-No.
Are you sure?
You look a bit puffy.
Change migraine to "yes".
-"When was your last menstrual period"?
-Oh, next question.
I'll put "in progress".
Okay.
Moving to psychiatric disorders.
"List all major behavioral diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etc".
What the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?
Episodes of sub-psychotic rage.
-Ass.
-Possible Tourette's.
All right.
"Moles, lesions or other skin conditions".
"Soup" tattoo on right buttock.
Okay, Sheldon.
Sheldon, look.
I am scared and in a lot of pain.
Could you please take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don't know, comforting?
Ahem.
I'm sorry.
There, there.
Everything's going to be fine.
Sheldon's here.
Thanks.
That's much better.
Oh, I'm so hungry.
Will you shut up?
We're all hungry.
Okay, our objective is the Boy Scout campsite to the east.
Easy target.
Big, doughy scoutmaster, couple of Cubs, mostly Webelos.
What kind of score?
Hot dogs, buns, s'mores.
I mean, it's a freaking 7-Eleven.
-All right.
Everyone grab flashlights.
-Okay.
Oh, my God.
Could it be?
Yes!
My mother put an "I love you" brisket in my backpack!
-Quick, get forks.
-Don't need forks.
It's so tender, it falls apart in your hands.
-He's right.
Yes.
I feel like we're forgetting something important.
Me too, but what?
Maybe a Tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?
LEONARD &  Yes!
Yes!
Now remember you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer so don't operate heavy machinery.
Try not to choke on your own drool.
Wait.
You have to help me get into bed.
Sheldon has to get me into bed.
Bet you never thought I'd say that.
Ha-ha-ha.
Yes.
The charm of your drug-addled candor knows no bounds.
You know, people think you're this weird robot man who's so annoying all the time, and you totally are.
But then it's like that movie Wall-E at the end.
You're so full of love and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.
That's a fairly labored metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.
Sing "Soft Kitty" to me.
"Soft Kitty" is for when you're sick.
You're not sick.
Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
Soft kitty, warm kitty Little ball of fur Wait, wait.
Let's sing it as a round.
I'll start.
Soft kitty, warm kitty Little ball of fur See, that's where you come in.
I'll start over.
Soft kitty, warm kitty Little ball of fur I've got all night, Sheldon.
Soft kitty, warm kitty -Little ball of fur -Soft kitty, warm kitty -Little ball of fur -Happy kitty, sleepy kitty -Happy kitty, sleepy kitty -Purr, purr, purr Purr, purr, purr And the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized-- Da, da, da!
--she was his cousin.
That's still not funny.
"That's still not funny".
And she was my second cousin.
"And she was my second cousin".
You're a real douche.
Who cares?
You slept with your cousin.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
So two years later, there's a knock on the door.
Guy opens it, and there is the snail who says, "What the heck was all that about"?
I don't really get it.
Well, see, it took two years for the snail to-- Not important.
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.
Where do you think this is going?
To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.
You're so funny.
You're like a standup comedian.
A Jewish standup comedian, that would be new.
Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.
No, I was just-- Because-- Never mind.
Look, Howard, this is our third date, and we both know what that means.
-We do?
-Sex.
You're kidding.
But I need to know whether you're looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.
Okay, just to be clear, there's only one correct answer, right?
I mean, it's not like "Chicken or fish"?
on an airplane?
Maybe you need to think about it a little.
Well, you know, it's not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.
Call me when you figure it out.
Three dates means sex?
Who knew?
Greetings, homeys.
Homette.
Why are you back from your date so early?
Well, in romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more.
-What exactly does that mean?
-He struck out.
Hey, did you know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?
Actually, I've never had three dates with the same woman.
With Penny and me, it took two years.
But now that I think about it, that was three dates.
Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up did she ask for any kind of commitment?
No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.
I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention I will wait for you to finish your conversation.
What are you talking about?
The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
I see.
Now, are we talking "date" the social interaction or "date" the dried fruit?
Never mind.
What's your announcement?
Oh, good, my turn.
Well, this is very exciting, and I wanted you to be among the first to know-- I hear you're gonna be on the radio with Ira Flatow from Science Friday next week.
Thank you, Kripke for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.
My pleasure.
-My thank-you was not sincere.
-But my pleasure is.
Let me ask you a question.
At what point did National Public Radio have to start scraping the bottom of the barrel for its guests?
Eeh-eeh.
Don't answer.
It's rhetorical.
Well, why are you such a stupidhead?
That is also rhetorical.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
Are you really gonna be on NPR?
Yes, they're interviewing me by phone from my office regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin ices.
It's pledge week, and they're trying to goose the ratings with controversy.
-Very cool.
Congratulations.
-Thank you.
My mother is very excited.
She's convening her Bible study group to listen in and then pray for my soul.
I was on the radio once.
I called into Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays: "Fever 104:"  That means "Fever 104: Home of the really good current music".
It's much catchier in Hindi.
All right, these are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow.
I need to make sure they're simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand.
Howard, look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.
I have a Master's in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.
Yes.
Look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.
You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don't have to do it.
In fact, it's better if you don't.
Otherwise, the rest of us look bad.
-Hi, guys.
-Hello.
Yo, Raj, talk to me.
I'm sorry, just screwing with you.
Hey, Howard, why haven't you called Bernadette?
Did she say something?
Said she hasn't heard from you.
I thought you liked her.
I do, you know, but she wants a commitment and I'm not sure she's my type.
She agreed to go out with you for free.
What more do you need?
Look, Bernadette is really nice.
I just always thought when I finally settled down into a relationship it would be with someone, you know, different.
Different how?
Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.
Are you high?
You'd have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian from Total Recall.
Okay, now you're just being unrealistic.
Anyway, that movie was 20 years ago.
Imagine how saggy those things would be.
You're gonna throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you're holding out for some fantasy?
Hey, just because you settled doesn't mean I have to.
Excuse me, I'm sitting here.
Hey, I did not settle for Leonard.
I mean, obviously, he isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with.
You know, physically.
Again, I'm right here.
I do not judge a book by its cover.
I am interested in the person underneath.
I am here, right?
You see me?
Hey, I'm interested in what's inside people too.
But, you know, why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry?
Yes, you're delicious caramel too.
I will tell you why it's wrong-- -Excuse me, may I interject?
-What?
Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.
Thank you, Sheldon.
Whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is an entirely different question.
IRA : This is Ira Flatow and you're listening to NPR's Science Friday.
Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California  is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Oh, this is gonna be a riot.
Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.
My pleasure, Ira.
Now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles.
Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?
Of course.
First, consider an ordinary magnet, which has, as even the most uneducated  in your audience must know, two poles  a north and south pole.
If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets each with its own north and south pole.
Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.
No, I hear you fine.
As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles.
The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, "monopole".
A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will is the existence of such monopoles.
I myself led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles.
Kripke, I found the nozzle.
I'm going to kill you.
So nice you could join me this evening.
You're looking lovely as always.
Thanks, Howard.
Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies.
Come on, Katee, don't make it sound so cheap.
I'm sorry.
Fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act.
Thank you.
So, ahem, shall we get started?
Sure, but can I ask you a question first?
You wanna play Cylon and colonist?
No, I wanna know why you're playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.
-You mean Bernadette?
-No, I mean Princess Leia.
Of course I mean Bernadette.
She's a wonderful girl and she really likes you.
-I know, but she's not you.
-I'm not me.
The real me is in Beverly Hills with a tall, handsome rich guy.
-Really?
Tall?
-Six-four.
Ouch.
You've got a wonderful girl in your life, and you're ignoring her to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a washcloth.
MRS.
Howard!
What are you doing in there?
I'm taking a bath!
I hope that's all you're doing!
We share that tub!
Don't remind me!
Oh, man.
All soaped up and no place to go.
How you doing, buddy?
I was humiliated on national radio.
How do you think I'm doing?
Come on, it wasn't that bad.
What do you want?
We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.
-Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.
-It wasn't funny.
I thought it was funny.
-Raj.
-You laughed.
Did you laugh?
I fell on the floor.
All right, he got you.
You can get him back.
-I refuse to sink to his level.
-You can't sink.
With all that helium in you, you're lucky you don't float away.
Are you really admitting defeat?
-I never admit defeat.
-Good.
However, on an unrelated topic, I'm never getting out of this bed again.
What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?
-I don't think that's possible.
-You're not helping.
I didn't come to help.
I came to mock.
Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like.
Like how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
He didn't stay and talk about his feelings with the other villains.
He broke out and poisoned Gotham's water supply.
Well I suppose I could poison Kripke.
-No, no.
It's a simple matter.
There are several toxic chemicals that would be untraceable in an autopsy.
Okay, that's the spirit but let's dial it back to a nonlethal form of vengeance.
Oh.
How about we put a whoopee cushion on his office chair?
He'll sit down and it'll sound like he's flatulent even though he's not.
Let's keep thinking.
Oh, gee, you're too late.
Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were here trolling around for neurotic little weasels.
I came to talk to Bernadette.
She's working today, right?
-I don't think she wants to see you.
-Why not?
Come on.
You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week.
Plus, I've been kind of talking some smack about you.
-Hello, Howard.
-Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.
-I can't.
I'm working.
-This will only take a second.
You asked me to think about where our relationship was going and I did.
Bernadette will you marry me?
Is this more comedy that I don't understand?
No, I'm serious.
I'm never gonna find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real.
-So this isn't a joke?
-No.
Then you're insane.
I prefer to think of myself as quirky.
Howard, we've only been on three dates.
We haven't even had sex yet.
Fair enough.
When's your break?
Wow.
Don't you just hate when this happens?
Wow.
All right, how's this for revenge?
A solution of hydrogen peroxide and one of saturated potassium iodide.
-What's this?
-Mountain Dew.
Ah.
Refreshing.
Now, we're going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.
-Foamy vengeance.
-Yes, exactly.
This is brilliant, Sheldon.
How are we gonna deploy it in Kripke's office?
Already taken care of.
Observe.
This is a live shot of Kripke's lab via a mini webcam I was able to install thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor's shirt pocket.
At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.
Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.
You flatter me, sir.
-Let me guess, motion sensors?
-Yes.
The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room.
Mwa, ha, ha.
I gotta say, I am really impressed.
This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even.
It may be low-tech but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.
Here comes Kripke.
Who's that with him?
I believe that's the president of the university.
-The board of directors.
Abort!
Abort!
-There is no abort.
-How could you not put in an abort?
-I made a boo-boo, all right?
I think the board will really appreciate how well we're using that NSA grant.
Right here we have a micro-controlled plasma-- Wow.
Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.
At least they don't know it was you.
SHELDON : Hello, Kripke.
This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper.
If you'd like to see the look on your stupid face this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube.
Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.
Well, I'm going back to India.
What's your plan?
-Hey, here's your tip from Table 7.
-Oh, thanks.
-Mm-hm.
-Testing.
Check.
Check two.
Oh, now what?
-You want me to throw him out?
-No, that's okay.
Are you sure?
He's small.
Bet I could get a nice tight spiral on him.
I wanna dedicate this number to a great gal who I've done wrong.
Bernadette I am so sorry For trying to propose to you Bernadette You found it creepy But that's just the kind of thing I do Ahhh I know now it was too soon To talk of love It was just a crazy idea That came to me in my tub But, Bernadette Give me one more chance Sweet Bernadette I'll get the hang of this thing They call romance Sweet Bernadette I dream to once again Kiss your lips Sweet Bernadette Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz Bernadette Oh, I am so sorry.
Are you kidding?
That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever done for me.
Bernadette Thank you, Cheesecake Factory.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Hey, Leonard, check this out.
Leonard, she's doing it again.
I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.
No, it upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution.
This is essentially why you have famine in India.
You want me to put it back?
-Leonard?
-It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.
What's up, my nerdizzles?
Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend, Bernadette.
-Hello.
-Leonard, Penny.
-You know my girlfriend, Bernadette.
-Yeah.
Hey.
Bernadette, say "fo'shizzle" to my nerdizzles.
I don't think I can.
I don't have Howard's street cred.
I hope it's all right, I told Bernadette she could join us for dinner.
-Sure.
The more, the merrier.
-No, that's a false equivalency.
More does not equal merry.
If there were 2000 people in this apartment, would we be celebrating?
No, we'd be suffocating.
-Sheldon.
-Don't "Sheldon" me.
-We ordered for five people, not six.
-It's fine.
We'll put it on the table, family-style.
Oh, sure.
Why don't we put our hands behind our backs have an old-fashioned eating contest?
Relax.
It'll be fine.
Sit down, you guys.
ALL EXCEPT  No.
-What?
Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.
-Why not?
-That's where Sheldon sits.
He can't sit somewhere else?
In the winter, that seat's close enough to the radiator so he's warm yet not so close that he sweats.
In the summer, it's in the path of a breeze created by opening windows there.
It faces the television at an angle that isn't direct so he can talk yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.
Perhaps there's hope for you after all.
-I love your shoes.
-Oh, thanks.
They are cute, aren't they?
-Where'd you get them?
-Shoes for Less.
-I've been meaning to go over there.
-Oh, great selection, great prices.
My mother was right.
Hell is real.
Come on, Sheldon, let the women-folk chat.
Women-folk?
Gals?
Chicks?
Utero-Americans?
-Just eat your dinner.
-Don't take him too seriously.
A lot of what he says is intended as humor.
Yeah, well, I don't think it's very funny.
Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.
Howard, never let her go.
Leonard, Howard says you're working on fundamental tests -of quantum mechanics.
-I am.
Are you interested in physics?
I find it fascinating.
If I hadn't gone into microbiology I probably would have gone into physics or ice dancing.
My tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point.
We're testing phase shift due to electric potential.
-That's amazing.
SHELDON : Yes.
Leonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.
While I appreciate the "oh, snap" I'm uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.
Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?
Yes, I am.
-Wanna see a simulation on my laptop?
-Oh, yeah.
Show me.
In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast.
Howard?
-Yeah?
Your shoes are delightful.
Where did you get them?
-What?
-Buzzinga.
I don't care.
Ha-ha.
Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.
That's not fair.
I got stuck behind a tree.
And a cow and a penguin.
Face it, dude, whether it's a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can't drive.
-Just need a little more practice.
-What you need is cheat codes motor skills and a genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at "Mario Kart".
Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?
It's not about shoes, is it?
I don't think I could go through that again.
-It's not about shoes.
-Then speak.
-Um, actually, can we do it in private?
-All right.
Go away.
I agree, it's rude, but she asked for privacy.
Thanks, Raj.
Okay, so here's the thing.
I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics.
-A little physics?
-Yeah.
There's no such thing.
Physics encompasses the entire universe.
From quantum particles to supernovas.
From spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.
Okay, cool, I don't need the PBS special.
I wanna know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job.
Like Bernadette does.
-Why can't Leonard teach you?
-Because I wanna surprise him.
Can't you surprise him in some other way?
For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback if you clean your apartment.
Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.
This would be a massive undertaking and my time is both limited and valuable.
You're sitting here playing video games all day.
Okay, point.
What sort of foundation do you have?
Did you take any science classes in school?
Sure.
I did the one with the frogs.
The one with the frogs.
It was pretty cool.
A lot of the girls threw up.
I gutted that thing like a deer.
No.
I'm sorry, Penny.
I don't think so.
Oh, come on, a smart guy like you?
It'll be a challenge.
You could make it like an experiment.
Interesting.
I suppose if someone could teach sign language to Koko the gorilla I could teach you some rudimentary physics.
Great.
It's a little insulting, but great.
I'll be Koko.
Mm.
Not likely.
Koko learned to understand over 2000 words.
Not one of which had anything to do with shoes.
Hey, fellas, this is my girlfriend, Bernadette.
My girlfriend, Bernadette.
-Who are all those people?
-I have no idea.
-Hey, Leonard.
-Hi.
Look, it's Howard and his girlfriend, Bernadette.
Thought I'd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.
Heh.
He doesn't mean salt mines.
He means where he works.
Yeah, no, I got it.
-So how's your experiment going?
-Terrific.
Getting the electron accelerator set up.
We should be ready day after tomorrow.
-Boy, I'd love to see that.
-You're welcome to come.
Really?
That'd be great.
How exciting is that?
Like Hanukkah in July.
Do they have that?
-No.
-Oh, you got me again.
This isn't non-fat yogurt.
This is fatty-fat fat.
Excuse me.
-Could you grab me another napkin?
-Sure.
Thanks, honey.
All right.
What is your deal?
Excuse me?
Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?
Yeah, so?
Wow, you really are a piece of work.
It's not enough you get the prom queen you have to get the head of the decorating committee too?
-What are you talking about?
-Look, don't play innocent with me.
I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.
-Has it ever worked?
-Not so far, but that's not the point.
Howard, relax.
I am not interested in your girlfriend.
I hope not, because you don't wanna mess with me.
I'm crazy.
I believe you.
Research journal, entry one.
I'm about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career: teaching Penny physics.
I'm calling it Project Gorilla.
-Hey, Sheldon.
-Come in.
Take a seat.
Subject has arrived.
I've extended a friendly, casual greeting.
Ready to get started?
One moment.
Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic.
Apparently, ignorance is bliss.
All right, let us begin.
-Where's your notebook?
-Um, I don't have one.
How are you gonna take notes without a notebook?
I have to take notes?
How else are you gonna study for the tests?
-There's gonna be a test?
-Tests.
Here.
It's college-ruled.
I hope that's not too intimidating.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Now, introduction to physics.
What is physics?
Physics comes from the ancient Greek word "physika.
" It's at this point that you'll wanna start taking notes.
Physika means the science of natural things.
And it is there in ancient Greece that our story begins.
-Ancient Greece?
-Ah.
If you have questions, raise your hand.
It's a warm summer evening, circa 600 B.C. You've finished your shopping at the local market or agora.
And you look up at the night sky.
And there you notice some of the stars seem to move so you name them planetes or wanderer.
Yes, Penny?
Does this have anything to do with Leonard's work?
This is the beginning of a 2600-year journey we're going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin SchrÃ dinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.
-Twenty-six hundred years?
-Yeah, give or take.
As I was saying, it's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece-- -Yes, Penny.
-I have to go to the bathroom.
-Can't you hold it?
-Not for 2600 years.
Project Gorilla, entry two.
I am exhausted.
-Howard?
-Uh-- Huh?
It unhooks in the front.
Oh, that explains a lot.
MRS.
Howard, I'm home.
Of course.
MRS.
Senior fitness was canceled.
It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike.
I'm fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.
That's great, Ma.
MRS.
What's great about an 80-year-old Armenian man with half his chin scraped off?
-I guess I should go.
-No, don't move.
Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?
MRS.
Lamb stew?
I'd have to go to the supermarket.
Please?
I got a real hankering.
MRS.
Oh, I can't say no to my little tushy-face.
-I'll be back soon.
-Thanks, Ma.
MRS.
Do you want the regular peas or the Le Sueur?
Always Le Sueur peas with lamb stew.
MRS.
You're right.
When you're right, you're right.
-What if they're out of the Le Sueur?
-Then get the regular!
MRS.
All right.
You don't have to yell.
Sorry about that.
-Let me just put that on vibrate.
-I'm already on vibrate.
Okay, now, that one I got.
Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?
What do you mean?
He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow, it might weird you out.
Really?
He said that?
-You're not jealous of Leonard, are you?
-Me?
No.
I may have mentioned that it's a little inappropriate to be asking another man's girlfriend to his experiment without discussing it with said man.
I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?
I didn't say anything like that.
I said Leonard has to ask my permission.
Come on, I don't wanna eat lamb stew with my mother.
Damn.
Was this close on the bra.
Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion.
So let's plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force-- Earth gravity.
--equals mass times So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?
Uh.
We know that Newton was a really smart cookie.
Oh, is that where Fig Newtons come from?
No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts.
-No, don't write that down.
-Sorry.
Now, if MA equals MG -what does that imply?
-I don't know.
What--?
But--?
How can you not know?
I just told you.
Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
Hey, you don't have to be so mean.
I'm sorry.
Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
No.
You just suck at teaching.
Really?
Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?
Oh, God.
Sheldon, look, I'm trying to understand but you're going too fast.
-Can you just back up a little bit?
-All right.
It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece-- Not that far back.
Okay, at what point did you begin to feel lost?
I don't know.
Where were we looking up at the night sky?
-Greece.
-Damn it.
Look, there's no need to get frustrated.
People learn at different rates.
Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which?
MA equals MG?
-Squared?
-No.
-Aristotle?
-No.
-Five?
-Oh!
Oh, then I don't know.
-Why are you crying?
-Because I'm stupid.
Well, that's no reason to cry.
No, one cries because one is sad.
For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.
Look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?
All right.
Leonard is attempting to learn why subatomic particles move the way they do.
Really?
That's it?
Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.
It's not.
That's why Leonard does it.
Okay, I just have one question.
What exactly are subatomic particles?
-A good question.
-Thank you.
And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, "What is physics"?
Oh, balls.
It's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece.
Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.
What did I do now?
I was in bed with Bernadette and you text-blocked me.
-What?
-Yeah, we were completely naked and about to devour each other when:  You text her that I have a problem with her hanging with you.
You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
But that's not what you tell her.
-What was I to tell her?
-I don't know.
Something that doesn't make me come off as a petty, jealous douche.
And what would that be?
Come on, do I have to think of everything?
Hey, Leonard, am I too late to see your experiment?
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?
-Same thing you're doing here.
-Came to see Leonard's experiment.
-No, you didn't.
You said Leonard's experiment was stupid.
You told her my experiment was stupid?
I was just repeating what Sheldon said.
Look, let's not get off topic.
Bernadette, I need to apologize.
You know, I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.
-Should I leave you two alone?
-No, Leonard, you should hear this.
Okay, good.
Because I wasn't really gonna go.
Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly but the truth is I'm not.
We're shocked.
Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.
Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.
But I now realize how foolish that is.
He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in his sweater.
It was a full turtleneck.
-And why aren't you helping me?
-I don't know.
Maybe because I'm crazy?
Bernadette, please, I'm asking you to give me another chance.
What do you think, Leonard?
Should I give him another chance?
It's up to you.
He didn't call your experiment stupid.
Come here, tushy-face.
Tushy-face.
That is going on Twitter right now.
Raj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment.
The interference pattern was cool when the electron beam was on.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Most people aren't that interested in what I do.
Actually, that's not true, Leonard.
I've been thinking that, given the parameters of your experiment the transport of electrons through the nano-fabricated rings is no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands.
Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the ring already demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect.
That's it.
That's all I know.
Oh, wait.
Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Aw, I always tear up when the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.
Tears seem appropriate.
Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a serious disease, which could lead to congestive heart failure.
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
-You really didn't like it, Sheldon?
-No, on the contrary.
I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character.
I was really with him up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas.
What a buzzkill that was.
When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.
Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth.
Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat.
A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
I just love decorating the Christmas tree, it makes me feel like a little girl again.
We didn't have a tree when I was growing up.
-Really?
Why not?
-Mm, in my family holidays weren't so much celebrated, as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.
Oh, sounds festive.
Did you at least give presents?
Hm, in a way.
We presented papers.
And then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.
Sheldon, what about you?
Did you have a tree?
Oh, yes.
We had a tree, we had a manger we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn.
To make things more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighborhood-wide seizures.
I take it you don't wanna help us trim the tree?
I do not.
But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you that add this.
What is it?
You're kidding, right?
It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.
Oh, sure, sure.
Yeah, very Christmassy.
Excuse me, it's much more Christmassy than anything you've put on the tree.
Here we go.
December 25th, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born.
Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer.
His birthday was moved to coincide with the traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats.
Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.
Merry Newtonmas, everyone.
I sense that's not sincere, although I have no idea why.
No, it's fine.
Sir Isaac can go next to this candy cane.
No, Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
-No, he doesn't.
-I understand.
You dispute Newton's claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
Yeah, you got me.
I'm a Leibniz man.
Perhaps when your mother gets here, she'll talk some sense into you.
-What?
Your mother's coming?
When?
-Tomorrow.
When were you gonna tell me?
Oh.
Tomorrow?
Why were you keeping this a secret?
-Well, I just-- I thought-- -If I could interject here.
Obviously, Leonard is concerned that his mother won't approve of you as his mate.
Wh--?
Why wouldn't she approve of me?
I'm adorable.
-Yeah, you are.
It's just my moth-- -If I could interject again.
Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family who have all chosen high-achieving partners.
He probably feels that it's doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement Hey, it's a big menu.
There's two pages just for desserts.
I know.
And those specials, they change every day.
Okay, it's lame when I say it, it's ridiculous when you pile on.
Okay.
Sorry.
What did she say when you told her we were going out?
Um.
You didn't tell her we were going out, did you?
Um.
-Why not?
-Um.
Leonard, I'm no expert on meditation but if you're trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is "om".
It was so nice of you to come to the airport to pick me up.
No trouble at all.
I drove, Mother.
I'm driving now.
Yes, dear.
Mommy's proud.
Thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum-brain-dynamic theory.
My pleasure.
You know, for a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain's water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.
Wait, wait, wait.
When did you send my mom notes on a paper?
August 16th.
Right after her carpal-tunnel surgery.
-Did I thank you for the flowers?
-You did.
-I don't really like flowers.
-Neither do I. -But it's the social convention.
-It is, isn't it?
Wait, wait, wait.
You had surgery?
-Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.
-No, I heard that.
Then what was all that "wait, wait, wait" about?
I just don't understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
Because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect while you avoid me due to unresolved childhood issues.
It's what we think caused your narcissistic-personality disorder.
We discussed it at length during our last video chat.
Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
Yes, but we are on the subject, so I'm obliged to ask.
Leonard, how are you?
-Fine, Mom.
How are you?
-Menopausal.
Now I'm less fine.
-Have you heard your brother's engaged?
-No.
Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?
My bad.
I did send a gift from both of us.
She's a remarkable girl.
The youngest appeals-court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medalist.
You must be very happy.
Why?
I'm not marrying her.
So how about you?
Are you seeing anyone interesting?
Well, I'm not sure about interesting, but-- -Not the time, Sheldon.
-Very well.
Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
It's all right, Sheldon.
I will just pretend that Leonard's not withholding information.
Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioral tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate.
Isnât she brilliant, Leonard?
How I envy you.
So, Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings towards one another?
What?
No.
Why not?
Because we don't have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.
I see.
-No, really.
I have a girlfriend now.
-And where is she this evening?
She had to go out of town, her grandmother died.
I see.
"Her grandmother died".
Honest to God.
Ahem.
Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What do you mean, you don't know what I'm talking about?
-Tell her I have a girlfriend.
-All right.
He "has" a "girlfriend".
Her name is Bernadette.
She's a waitress, but going to school to be a microbiologist.
The more passionately you stick to this construct the more you're hurting your partner.
Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?
-Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
-Oh, glad you're here.
Sit down, I'll get you a plate.
Mom, you remember Penny?
Oh, yes, the waitress/actress with the unresolved father issues.
Has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?
Well, he sent me a football and a catcher's mitt for Christmas so I'm gonna say no.
If it helps, we're all good with your breasts.
Classic overcompensation.
Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard, that reminds me.
I'm divorcing yours.
-What?
-Yes.
He was cheating on me.
-No.
Yes.
With some waitress from the university cafeteria.
Can you believe it?
A waitress.
Oh, no offense, dear.
No, it sounded like a compliment.
-When did this happen?
-Well, let's see.
Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard's father?
September 22nd.
Right, the weekend after Leonard's dog died.
Mitzy's dead?
She was old and blind, Leonard.
What choice did we have?
I don't believe this.
Why am I the last to know?
Excuse me, I am the one getting a divorce Mitzy is the one who is dead, why are you the one making a fuss?
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I'm way out of line.
Penny, what's new in your life?
Nothing.
Not a damn thing.
Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.
Oh, it's not a problem.
I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery.
No, you do not.
Your "check engine" light is on.
Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that.
So you must be devastated about your divorce.
Oh, not at all.
But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that's not subjected to regular maintenance.
Come on, I mean, you're not upset that your marriage is over?
Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger but that's the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.
-Sure.
Sure.
-Thankfully, my shock was mitigated by the fact that I haven't had intercourse with him in eight years.
-Eight years?
-Oh, that's nothing.
I've been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.
Yikes.
Wha--?
What's so funny?
That's exactly what I say during orgasms: Yikes.
I could use a drink.
You wanna stop for a drink?
-Oh, I don't drink.
-I do.
I'll teach you.
Leonard?
Leonard?
Leonard?
What is it?
I made tea.
I don't want tea.
I didn't make tea for you.
This is my tea.
Then why are you telling me?
It's a conversation starter.
That's a lousy conversation starter.
Oh, is it?
We're conversing.
Checkmate.
What do you want, Sheldon?
What I want is to be departing the starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttlecraft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
Mm, I want that too.
Why are you here?
To comfort you, of course.
No, that's not going to work at all.
I'll comfort you from over here.
Leonard, what you're experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be-realized ideal family unit.
-Thank you, that's very comforting.
-That's not the comforting part.
-It's not?
-No.
No, the comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you're feeling, "Weltschmerz".
It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical idealized world.
You're right, I do feel better.
Yeah, the Germans have always been a comforting people.
Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you you always have me, your surrogate family.
You're my surrogate family?
If it's any consolation, I'm not happy about it either.
Good night.
Okay, now this time, try drinking it all at once.
Ah.
Yikes.
I've been responsible for my own buzz since 2003.
Another round for me and my homegirl.
I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.
As long as you don't feel it running down your pants, you're fine.
That is fascinating.
I'm noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions.
For example, I'm seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake.
What do you think?
Well, we are known for our cheesecake.
-Hit us again.
-Yes.
-If a little is good, more must be better.
-Ha, ha.
-Hey, Bev, guess what?
-What?
I'm sleeping with your son.
Really?
Which one?
The one from whom I live across the hall from.
Oh, well, that's convenient.
How did his penis turn out?
Oh, Beverly, I can't talk to my boyfriend's mother about his penis.
Oh, fair enough.
What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy's penis?
Actually, I've only had the cheesecake.
One more time.
You know, Leonard did not wanna tell you we were dating.
Really?
That means he's either embarrassed by the relationship or he doesn't care enough about his mother to tell her he's in one.
Either way, one of us should be insulted.
-Well, let's go find out who.
-You go get a taxi.
I'm gonna slip my business card into that busboy's back pocket cupping his firm right buttock as I do so.
-Leonard?
-Sonny boy.
Get out here!
Your mommy wants to talk to you!
What the hell is going on?
You're in trouble.
Why didn't you tell me you were tapping my homegirl?
-Did I say that right?
-Yeah.
Not bad, not bad.
Are you guys drunk?
Well, I hope so.
Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco?
Now, how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman?
-Heh, heh.
Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Is it because she's uneducated, trapped in a menial service position?
What the hell happened to lovely and charming?
How come you didn't tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce?
How come you didn't tell me you had surgery?
How come you didn't tell me my dog died?
What I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship.
I do.
There.
It's late.
Now, go to bed.
I'm getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.
That's the Del Taco.
Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
Speaking of warm feelings.
Come here.
No, I'd rather have the busboy.
Thank you for taking me to the airport.
You're very welcome.
Once again, I'm driving.
I'm right here.
Please, I am very hung-over and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval.
Sheldon, I do hope you forgive me for my inappropriate behavior last night.
I don't blame you.
-You were intoxicated.
-Thank you.
I blame Penny.
I blame Penny too.
Bad Penny.
Wait a minute, what are you talking about?
What inappropriate behavior?
-I think it's best that you not know.
-Agreed.
Agreed.
What the hell, agreed.
And I want you to take very good care of this young woman.
-Aw.
Thank you, Beverly.
-You're welcome.
She doesn't have much in the way of career prospects.
Don't make her responsible for her own orgasms as well.
Remember when I was complaining that you don't communicate with me enough?
-Yes, dear.
-I'm over it.
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Look at us, getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they're our girlfriends.
Yes.
I mean, actual women are the best.
I don't understand.
What other kind of women are there?
Artificial women are your department.
You wanna take this?
No, it would just freak him out.
Listen, before we leave, I should warn you I'm a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.
What are you trying to tell me, Howard?
There might be making out in the car or restaurant.
I don't want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable so it would help if you and Penny made out too.
Don't worry, we're planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
Namaste, white people.
Good news.
I've rented us -the four-hour edition of Watchmen.
-Got it.
-Seen it.
-Detailed analysis posted online.
Then what are we gonna do tonight?
Sorry.
Howard and I are going out with Penny and Bernadette.
Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard.
These broncos have been saddled.
How did we get actual women?
Great.
They get girlfriends and they just abandon us?
It is great, isn't it?
We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.
-We do?
-Oh, yes.
I discovered I don't have enough room on my hard drive for a LINUX partition.
You and I are gonna perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
-I don't wanna do that.
-All right.
Well, I'm going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
Well, what about me?
Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women.
Maybe you should look into that.
Dude, there are so many cool things we could be doing tonight.
Look.
At the Glendale Galleria: "Put on your best zoot suit.
It's a salute to swing music in the center court near Macy's, Huh?
Huh?
A salute to zoot.
-Sounds like a hoot.
-I'm sorry, Raj.
I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight much less one that's linked to race riots in the 1940s.
Race riots?
The Zoot Suit Riots.
Oh.
I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale.
Why don't we go to the galleria and walk around?
I don't need anything at the galleria.
You need anything at the galleria?
No, we would just walk around and see what's what.
That's a semantically null sentence.
Okay, well, how about this?
From the university website: "Seven p.m. to 10 p.m., Norton Hall Multipurpose Room mixer for grad students and faculty of the Science and Humanities Departments.
Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be".
Well, that's certainly amusing but I have no interest.
Come on, Sheldon.
The world is filled with people doing things outside.
Let's go outside.
Outside is good.
If outside is so good why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?
I don't know.
It's a marketing scheme.
Please, Sheldon, I'm a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.
Let me offer you a compromise.
Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery I use my imagination.
Oh, boy.
One of my favorite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott's mathematical fantasy Flatland.
I don't wanna go to Flatland.
You're only saying that because you haven't been there.
I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
Oy.
Is that you, Raj?
I don't recognize your edge.
Sheldon, I'm begging you.
I want to go to this mixer, and I don't want to go alone.
Well, you're in luck.
There's a mixer here in Flatland.
Oh, look.
There's a sexually attractive line segment.
-Chat her up.
-What?
Tell her you're a circle.
Flatland gals are all hot for circles.
I hope you're hungry.
We're going to a terrific restaurant.
Oh, yeah, I'm starved.
When you spend all day in a bio lab watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize rodents it really works up an appetite.
Flesh-eating bacteria and yet I still wanna kiss this woman.
What does that tell you?
You'd be willing to die a horrible death on the off chance you'd get to second base.
We're way past second base.
Right, Howard?
Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are.
How's your work going, Penny?
Any acting jobs?
The last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley.
But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.
Well, great.
How come?
Well, promise you won't make fun of me?
Of course.
I would never make fun of you.
Okay, well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair I'm gonna get a national commercial.
What?
Seriously?
You're getting career advice from a psychic?
Good job not making fun of her.
She's not one of those phonies, okay?
She wrote a book, has her own website.
Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?
They don't just let anyone have a website.
-Why are you being such a jerk?
-You're surprised?
Your psychic didn't tell you I was going to be a jerk?
Heh, heh.
Bite me.
-Come on, Penny.
-Why don't you kids go ahead and chat?
We're gonna make out back here.
I'm sliding into third.
Thanks for coming with me.
Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.
Did you really have to bring it with you?
What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
-Come on, let's get a drink.
-I don't drink.
Well, I do.
And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot.
I'll have a screwdriver, please.
And don't be chintzy with the screw.
I would like a root-beer float.
-Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.
-They don't?
Well, apparently these people and I differ greatly on the definition of "party".
-He'll have a Shirley Temple.
-And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.
-Okay, let's check out the females.
-All right.
There's a female.
That's Professor Wilkinson's wife.
She's like 80.
But she's female.
Isn't that the game?
-No.
I'm looking for a hookup.
-Oh, yes.
So the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?
Not so loud.
But ideally, yes.
-Thanks.
-Thank you.
And what is my function as wingman?
-You help me run my game.
-Okay.
And what is your game?
When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.
Hey, that's pretty cool.
What is it?
It's a limited edition Green Lantern lantern.
My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
You're very funny.
I'm Abby.
-I'm Sheldon.
-How do you do?
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
Call me Raj.
-Hey, Raj.
Where are you from?
-The mysterious subcontinent of India.
-Ooh.
India.
-You know India?
-I saw Slumdog Millionaire.
-Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.
I thought your father was a gynecologist.
I'm sorry.
Martha, come here.
Meet Raj and Sheldon.
-My friend Martha.
-Hi.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?
In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.
Oh, that is so awesome.
Thank you.
Have you chosen one to copulate with?
So, what should we talk about?
Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots.
Leonard?
We don't need to talk about that anymore.
Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.
I'm sorry, but facts are facts.
Right, and if you can't understand it, it's not a fact.
No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.
-Oh, got it.
Thank you for educating me.
-Oh, you're welcome.
-How's your fish?
-Amazing.
-Would you like to try some?
-Yeah, sure.
Well, the fact is you can't.
Howard, Bernadette, you're both scientists.
Help me out here.
Wanna jump in the middle of another couple's argument?
-No, thank you.
-Sorry.
Maybe we should just stop talking about this.
Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.
-How is everything tonight?
-Really uncomfortable.
The best thing about a monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is even if you have different ideas you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love-- You want your fish?
Knew you were gonna do that.
Doesn't make me psychic.
Attaboy, Leonard.
Make it worse.
American woman Listen what I say What's going on?
We scored.
I'm the wingman.
American woman -Hey.
-Laser.
Had a great night last night.
I don't like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base.
-What the hell is eighth base?
-Seventh base with shirt off.
Well, my shirt.
-How'd things go with Penny?
-Oh, couldn't be better.
Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?
It's not just Cylons.
Superman's next.
I was gonna try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch but I can come back when you don't have a high-powered weapon.
How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.
And that didn't bother you?
Au contraire, it meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.
What am I supposed to do?
Pretend I believe something I don't when I'm with Penny?
Hey, I'm sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she's with you.
Do me a favor.
Lean over, put your head right here.
Let me show you another way to look at this.
Here we have the universe of all women.
Okay, these are the ones you wanna sleep with.
These are the women who believe exactly what you believe.
These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you.
And right there, in the little triple intersection is your ideal mate.
Odds are she's a short physicist with low self-esteem who lives in a government research facility in China.
What's your point?
To keep having a sexual relationship with Penny I have to give up everything I believe in?
My intellectual integrity?
The very nature of who I am?
I can't do that, Howard.
I respect that.
-What is that?
-Your new girlfriend.
Have fun tonight.
"The dog".
"The roof".
"Grapes".
One minute.
-What was that?
-It means, "Come in".
It's taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer.
I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom.
Now I thought I'd learn Finnish.
That's Hindi for, "Whatever floats your boat".
Listen, I got a text from that girl Abby and she and Martha wanna hang out with us again.
-What do you say?
-I don't say anything.
I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you've gone insane.
-I don't get it.
You had a great time.
-Yes, exactly.
I had a great time.
That's done.
I've moved on to other things.
For example, after I learn Finnish, I'm not going to learn Finnish again.
Please, Sheldon.
I'm a lost Indian boy far from home and I want a girlfriend, and I want her to be Abby and she'll only come if she can bring Martha.
I highly doubt there is any argument you can make threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation supplication or "vetoomus" that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.
My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.
Oh, my.
I've admired these for years.
Does that mean we can go out with the girls again?
Hulk agree to second date with puny humans.
You can't wear the hands on the date.
Hulk sad.
Hey.
Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh?
Not only is it courteous, it's safety-smart.
Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer-lint ignition.
And now you're supposed to say, "Wow, what an interesting fact.
Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy.
I could never be mad at you".
Wow.
That's all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?
No, I'm sorry.
I really am.
It's not right to mock what a person believes in.
Thank you.
You willing to go to my psychic and see what it's about?
You willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
I would not.
-Okay, let's go see your psychic.
-Really?
Well, yeah.
One of us has to keep an open mind.
-Saying I don't have an open mind?
-No.
Let me help you with this stuff.
You know, I believe in ghosts too.
-Great.
-And astrology.
I know.
And pyramid power and healing crystals.
Oh, no, no, no.
Crystals don't work.
Really?
That's the line?
Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?
Oh, voodoo's real.
You don't wanna mess with voodoo.
Flatland is more than just a mathematical essay.
It is also a treatise on Victorian social mores.
You know, I had never considered that.
Wow.
I mean, that's going to completely change my visits there.
-Well, it's late.
-Uh-huh.
Time for bed.
Okay.
Good night, puny human.
Sheldon?
Yes?
Listen, they're kind of getting busy in the living room and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while.
Well, I suppose.
Come in.
I'll sleep in Leonard's room.
Good night.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat.
You know, just the guys.
Oh, God.
Yes, we get it.
You have a girlfriend now.
-A little jealous, are we?
-No, I'm not jealous.
All right, I'd kill a hobo if it would get me laid.
Now, can we order?
Oh, dear Lord, they redid the menu.
So what?
It's the same food.
Oh, is it?
Look at this.
General Tso's Chicken is no longer listed under "specialties".
It's now under "chicken".
-So?
-Yes, General Tso.
Not "Tso" the chicken, "so" the question.
-So?
-So why is it no longer a specialty?
Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself?
And look over here.
"Shrimp in mobster sauce".
What is mobster sauce?
-It's obviously a typo.
-Perhaps.
Or perhaps this restaurant's now a front for organized crime.
For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.
No, no, no.
I think it just means it's the kind of sauce that mobsters like.
It doesn't mean any of that.
It's a typo.
-You know what?
Let's just get a pizza.
-Good idea.
We'll go to Corleone's.
Sure, no mobsters there.
You know, the more I think about it the mobster sauce couldn't possibly contain chunks of mobster.
And why is that?
-It was listed under "seafood".
What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?
What the--?
-The TV is gone.
-So are our laptops.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
It's all right.
They didn't take my comic books.
They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard drives our PS2, our PS3, our Xbox, our Xbox 360, our classic Nintendo our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64, and our Wii.
We like games.
Right, games.
They took "Halo 1," "Halo 2," "Halo 3," "Call of Duty 1," "Call of Duty 2" "Call of Duty 3," "Rock Band" "Final Fantasy I" through "IX," "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time" "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess," "Super Mario Bros".
"Mario & Sonic at the Winter Olympics" and "Ms. Pac-Man".
Assorted video games.
When does the CSI team get here?
-What?
-In anticipation of their arrival I've bagged some evidence.
One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home.
You should be able to pull prints off this.
Here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.
-What about me?
-I'm sorry, Leonard it's too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.
Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?
I'd be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.
I'm not crazy.
My mother had me tested.
We're done.
Call this number, and we'll fax you a copy of the report.
You can submit it to your insurance company.
I'm sorry, that's the end of your inquiry?
Do you have any more information that might be relevant?
Goodness.
Where do I begin?
For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a restatement of the quantum measurement problem.
How's that going to help them?
They could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a restatement in the next couple of months.
If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.
Good night, fellas.
Come on, Bochco.
What are we supposed to do now?
The only thing we can do: Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.
Does that mean you've ruled me out as a suspect?
Oh, how I wish I could.
I do not have to urinate.
I am the master of my own bladder.
Drat.
I can't believe it.
If I hadn't been working the dinner shift I would've run right into the robbers.
Hey, there's no reason for you to be scared.
I'm not scared.
I would've gone all Nebraska on their asses.
Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.
-Leonard and Penny.
-Hand me the bat.
We just had a major crime in the building and you open the door without asking who it is?
It won't happen again.
What's up?
Nothing.
Just wanted to see if you were both okay.
We're fine, Sheldon.
All right, then.
-Good night.
Good night.
-Well, that was weird.
Even for him.
-Mm.
Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.
Who is it?
Sheldon.
Sheldon Cooper.
-Yes?
-May I come in?
Yeah.
I see you're drinking wine.
Yes, we are.
And we're about to go to bed.
Uh-huh.
Sheldon, do you wanna sleep here tonight?
As small as Leonard is I don't think the two of you would be comfortable on the couch.
-So, what do you want?
-It's not what I want.
It's what evolution wants.
Human beings are primates.
Primates have evolved to live in groups both for protection and support.
But you don't like other people.
I do tonight.
It's scary over there.
It's getting scary here too.
Um.
"Three Little Kittens"?
"Three Little Pigs"?
God, I don't know.
Star Wars?
Did we win?
Can we go to bed?
Good Lord, I could not have made this easier.
A hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus P, "higs".
Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone "bow-zone".
Pear, tickle, "pear-tickle".
"Higgs boson particle".
How could you not get that?
He's right, Penny.
It's all there.
Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you're feeling insecure -but we've really gotta go to sleep.
-All right.
I'll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
-Great.
Good night.
-Wait, wait.
What's 0400?
Four a.m. -That's, like, in 45 minutes.
Just keep walking.
WOMAN : It's quiet out there.
Maybe a little too quiet.
Where are you going?
Just gonna take a look around outside.
Bad idea.
No, Jim, don't open the door.
Listen to her, Jim.
Don't worry.
There's no one out there.
Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.
Who is it?
All right.
We've got a titanium deadbolt and a reinforced jam controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system.
-What if they cut the power?
-There's a 200-watt -uninterruptible backup power supply.
-If someone steals my keys?
There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
What if somebody kidnaps me, records my voice and then cuts off my thumb?
I'll send them a basket of muffins.
Now, inside we've got motion detectors, infrared sensors and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial-recognition software.
Where did you get all this stuff?
I got a buddy over at the Department of Defense.
-He just gave it to you?
-I'm sure he would've if I'd asked.
Ironically, their security isn't all that good.
Raj, your car is blocking me.
Intruder alert.
Intruder alert.
-Intruder alert.
-What the hell?
-Sorry, let me help you.
-Intruder alert.
Wonderful security system if we're attacked by a school of tuna.
Don't worry, the net's gonna be electrified.
Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably.
Better.
SHELDON : Sheldon's journal.
Security system in place.
However, sleep continues to elude me.
I've seen the underbelly of Pasadena this so-called City of Roses and it haunts me.
Ah!
The injustice.
I lie here awake, tormented, while out there, evil lurks probably playing "Donkey Kong" on my classic Nintendo.
Oh, dear.
I am the master of my own bladder.
Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.
Oh, my-- God, Sheldon.
What the hell are you doing out there?
I heard a noise.
It was us.
We knocked over a lamp.
-Why would you knock over a lamp?
-We were gonna-- He doesn't need to know what we were doing, Leonard.
Oh.
No, she's right.
I don't need to know what you were doing.
-Carry on.
-What are you doing?
Use the door.
Good thinking.
Hey, perhaps I'll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
Great.
You do that.
Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
I'm lactose intolerant.
And you don't wish to alarm me with any more loud noises.
Very thoughtful.
-Warm milk, Penny?
-No, thanks.
Fine.
Good night to you, sir.
Miss.
-Sorry about that.
-What can you do?
Intruder alert.
Intruder alert.
Intruder alert.
Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.
-Sheldon, are you okay?
-I'm fine.
Though I'm no longer the master of my own bladder.
My new computer came with Windows 7.
Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista.
I don't like that.
Don't you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
Our apartment was broken into.
Our security system tried to kill me.
And as a result, I'm leaving Pasadena forever.
Tell me how that's overreacting.
Come on, Sheldon.
You can't move.
Don't you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?
Oh, if that were only true.
Unfortunately, as I'm earthbound for the foreseeable future I need to find a location that's more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena.
Like Enid, Oklahoma.
Low crime rate, and high-speed Internet connectivity but no model-train shops.
Sorry, Enid.
Is he quitting his job at the university?
Oh, no.
He's gonna telecommute.
Everybody's really excited about it.
All right.
Boone, North Carolina.
"Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake: Danel Boone".
That sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd.
-Penny, you're from Nebraska, correct?
-Born and raised.
It will take me a few days to get settled.
After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping my possessions to Bozeman, Montana.
In the meantime, please forward my mail.
Anyplace specific, or just the Bozeman, Montana loony bin?
I sense you're making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called the Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there.
Oh, come on.
So you were the victim of a crime.
That's part of life.
When my great-grandfather first came to this country he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York.
You know what happened?
Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver  got ripped off.
But those people moved on, and so should you.
I am moving on.
I'm going to be a Bozite.
They call themselves Bozites?
They should.
It's one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.
Sheldon, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm gonna miss you.
Please, Penny.
As you know, I'm not comfortable with prolonged goodbyes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I've prepared a short video.
Greetings.
As you know, I'm not comfortable with prolonged goodbyes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I've prepared this short video.
The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance.
Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that.
Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again.
Live long and prosper.
Sheldon, that's so-- You might wanna lock the door behind me.
This isn't Bozeman.
How the hell do I know who's the friend and who's the acquaintance?
That is a bracing cold.
An invigorating cold.
Lord, is it cold.
Help you with your bag, sir?
Thank you, fellow Bozite.
And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town's chamber of commerce.
Wait.
Wait.
Excuse me!
One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.
Hey, look who's back.
Interesting.
The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
What you doing?
Attempting to view work as a peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
Interesting.
I usually just have coffee.
-You've been up all night?
-Is it morning?
-Yes.
-Then I've been up all night.
And you're stuck?
Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
Uh, sorry, sweetie.
I can't help you till I've had my coffee.
If you don't put him in his crate at night, he just runs around the apartment.
What is he doing now?
Mm, he's either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.
Captain Hook's hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator.
If you're going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.
Aye, aye, captain.
I can't see it.
It just won't coalesce.
Maybe you need a fresh start.
You're right.
Great idea, Leonard.
Thank you.
Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass.
How long has he been stuck?
Mm, intellectually, about 30 hours.
Emotionally, about 29 years.
Unit cell contains two carbon atoms.
Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
Have you tried rebooting him?
No.
I think it's a firmware problem.
Hey, it's disco night at the Moonlight Roller Rink tonight.
Who's up for getting down?
Oh, that's perfect.
Bernadette's been hawking me to take her roller skating.
Penny likes to skate.
The four of us could double.
We're in.
Great.
It's not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.
-You can come with us.
-No.
I don't have to go.
I'm happy just to guide you to suitable entertainment choices.
I'm a walking, brown yelp.com.
Structure, constant structure.
One atom.
Boy, he's really gone, isn't he?
Yeah.
This morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.
I thought I smelled popcorn.
The same as fermions.
Travels on a pathway.
Hexagonal.
Always hexagonal.
I haven't seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
Hey.
Those are my lima beans.
Not lima beans.
Carbon atoms.
But if I don't eat my lima beans, I can't have my cookie.
Here.
You want my peas?
Peas.
Perfect.
They can be electrons.
You want my corn?
Don't be ridiculous.
What would I do with corn?
Roller skating.
Shall we grab a bite to eat first?
Good.
P.F. Chang's?
My mom has coupons.
Oh, great.
-Your mom is not coming, right?
-Not this time.
I promise.
Just to be clear, roller-skating was my idea.
I'm unhappy that you turned it into a date and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.
The plural of "coccyx" is "coccyges".
Screw you.
Give me back my lima beans.
Oh, my God.
Have you ever been so embarrassed?
Not recently.
I don't know which was lamer, their roller skating or their disco dancing.
For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.
You had some nice moves out there, Howard.
-Thanks.
You too.
-You noticed all the people looking at us?
Not really.
I was in my boogie zone.
-And when Howard tried to do the splits?
-Shh.
Sorry, I'm moving slow.
-I think I bruised my coccyx.
-Aw, poor baby.
Don't tell Koothrappali.
-After you.
Oh.
What a gentleman.
Hey, Sheldon.
Oh, my God, are you--?
Whoa!
Good Lord!
You're ruining everything!
-Oh, damn.
-Are you okay?
Do I look okay?
Don't bark at me.
I fell too.
You've been falling all night.
You're used to it.
Sheldon, what are you doing?
The same thing I've been doing.
Trying to figure out why electrons have no mass -when traveling through graphene.
-With marbles?
I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn't I?
Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?
Two, three days.
Not important.
I don't need sleep.
I need answers.
I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squateth the toad of truth.
The toad of truth?
Is that a physics thing?
No.
That's a crazy thing.
Okay, Sheldon.
What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don't get enough REM sleep?
They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
Which leads to?
Impaired cognitive function.
Right.
So march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.
But I don't wanna go to bed.
I'm gonna count to three.
One-- Oh, all right.
That was amazing how you handled him.
I know how to deal with stubborn children.
My mother used to run an illegal daycare center in our basement.
Leonard.
You're giggling in your sleep.
It's not me.
It's my new ring tone.
The Joker.
From Batman.
Well, it creeps me out.
Me too.
But I paid 3 bucks for it.
Well, just answer the phone.
Hello?
Yeah, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.
Yeah.
He's my roommate.
Oh.
Is he okay?
All right.
I'll be right there.
What happened?
Sheldon's escaped and is terrorizing the village.
Okay, have fun.
Hi.
I'm Dr. Hofstadter.
-Where is he?
-Ball pit.
-Thanks for not calling the cops.
-Oh, it's no big deal.
My sister's got a kid who's special.
Yeah, well, he's extra special.
Hey, Shelly.
What you doing?
Size ratio was all wrong.
Couldn't visualize it.
Needed bigger carbon atoms.
Sure, sure.
How did you get into this place?
Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single circuit alarm.
Child's play.
You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.
No, I don't think so.
We need to go home now.
But I'm still working.
If you don't come out of there, I'm gonna have to drag you out.
You can try but you'll never catch me.
For God sakes.
Sheldon, come here!
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Leonard and Penny.
-Leonard and Penny.
-Aah!
What?
What, what, what?
Leonard and Penny.
-What?
-I have good news.
And you had to barge in and wake us up -in the middle of the night?
-Your cell phone was off.
Because we didn't wanna be disturbed.
That didn't work out, did it?
Sheldon, what do you want?
I came to tell you I've got the answer.
Really?
You figured out the graphene problem?
No, I'm still hopelessly stuck on that.
But I figured out how to figure it out.
I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong.
We have to break up.
What are you talking about?
Ahem.
Oh.
Einstein.
Yeah.
I'm gonna need a little more.
Albert Einstein.
Keep going.
When Einstein came up with special relativity he was working at the patent office.
So you're gonna go work at the patent office?
Oh, don't be absurd.
That's in Washington.
I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern.
No.
I'm going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background.
A great plan.
Of course.
Even talking to you is sufficiently menial.
I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
Okay.
Well, thanks for sharing with us.
-Good night.
-You're welcome.
Good night to you too.
Oh.
By the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment.
I noticed your snoring seems to be worse when you're on your back.
No.
Leonard doesn't snore.
No.
I wasn't talking to Leonard.
Told you.
So, Mr. Cooper, you're looking for a job.
A menial job.
Like yours.
Why, thank you for noticing.
I'm menial employee of the month.
Do you have a particular field in mind?
I do.
For thousands of years the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives laboring to erect monuments under the lash of betters.
Until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged.
Do you have anything like that?
-No.
-Shouldn't you check your database?
No.
You didn't really type.
I didn't really have to.
So how about construction?
Oh, that would be good.
Yeah, sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.
No, no.
This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.
-I could do that.
-Good.
-One question.
-Yes?
What's sheetrock?
Moving on.
How about doing deliveries for a florist?
That seems acceptable.
-Do you have your own car?
-I don't drive.
Of course you don't.
Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question.
What was your last job?
Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M Theory.
Or in layman's terms, string theory.
I see.
Just give me a second.
Security!
Okay.
I'll get those drinks started for you.
Behind you.
Sheldon?
What the hell are you doing?
Trying to get these tables cleared.
We're slammed.
No, wait.
Wait.
No, wait.
What are you doing here?
A reasonable question.
I asked myself: "What is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable"?
Three answers came to mind.
A toll booth attendant, an Apple store genius and what Penny does.
Now, since I don't like touching other people's coins and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word "genius" here I am.
You just walked in and they hired you?
-Just like that?
-Oh, heavens no.
Since I don't need to be paid, I didn't need to be hired.
I simply came in, picked up a tray and started working for the man.
Let me get that plate out of your way.
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
Is it?
Just a moment ago, I had a minor epiphany regarding polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate.
-Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
-Thanks.
Sheldon, wait.
This isn't even what I do.
I'm a waitress, not a busboy.
You're right.
That is more menial.
Hello, I'm Sheldon.
I'll be your server today.
I don't recommend the salmon.
I saw it in the kitchen.
All right.
One bacon cheeseburger breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously.
Kudos.
And beer-battered fish and chips.
Now, here's your tartar sauce.
I also brought you salsa.
A little unconventional, but I think you'll like it.
It's zingy.
And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance.
Hang on.
-Black beans, not pinto beans?
-Yes.
-Guacamole?
No cilantro?
Lettuce?
-Yep.
-Understand why I'm doing this?
-I do.
That'll be all.
That was fun.
How long can he keep this up?
I heard about this professor who melted down, bought a van spent the rest of his life as a dog groomer.
Never went back to the university?
Only to shampoo Professor Shamburg's shih tzu.
Sheesh.
You know, I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.
But he's afraid of dogs.
Yeah.
That's the only thing wrong with that plan.
Hey, guys.
Sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped.
What's this?
Sheldon took our order.
Sheldon doesn't work here.
Well, honey, not to complain but we were starting to think you didn't either.
Is that really necessary?
Good Lord.
The interference pattern in the fracture.
The motion of the wave through the structure.
I've been looking at it all wrong.
I can't consider the electrons as particles.
They move through the graphene as a wave.
It's a wave!
The moment to applaud would be now.
Troglodytes.
Sheldon.
Where are you going?
Aren't you gonna clean this?
I'm sorry, I don't work here.
-Happy now?
-I'm on a cloud.
Swing me.
Not much between despair and ecstasy One night in Bangkok And the tough guys tumble Can't be too careful with your company I can feel the devil walking next to me  Sheldon, come here!
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
Buzzinga.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Yeah, I miss you too, sweetie.
Ha, ha.
Okay, listen, I gotta go, but I'll see you tonight.
Bye-bye.
Yeah, bye-bye.
No, you hang up first.
Hello?
Dude, I'm glad you finally got a girlfriend but do you have to do lovey-dovey in front of us who don't?
Actually, he might have to.
There's an economic concept known as a "positional good" in which an object is only valued because it's not possessed by others.
The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial but less precise "neener-neener".
That's not true.
My happiness is not dependent on my best friend -being miserable and alone.
-Thank you.
I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a perk.
-Who's miserable and alone?
-Me.
Oh.
I used to be like that.
Then I got a girlfriend.
In pre-1976 terms, "neener-neener".
What are you and Bernadette doing for Valentine's Day?
Yeah, I'm pulling out all the stops.
There's a 39.95 Lover's Special at P.F. Chang's.
Yeah, egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok.
Yeah, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.
Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded wouldn't a more appropriate celebration be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder?
I understand your point, but given the choice Jews always go with Chinese food.
If anyone's interested, I'll be spending this Valentine's Day the same way I spend every Valentine's.
Buying rotisserie chicken, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.
Okay, so to sum up, one giant marble horse one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken and let's see.
Who's left?
Oh, that's right, my plans.
Isnât anyone gonna ask?
-You're gonna have sex with Penny.
-That's not what I was gonna tell you.
It's okay.
I don't mind hearing about your sex life.
It's his that bugs me.
Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN Super Collider on February 14th?
Professor Norton.
God knows why.
He hasn't published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.
Professor Norton can't make it.
He threw his back out climbing.
I heard he threw his back out climbing on his girlfriend.
-Weather girl on Channel Two?
-That's the one.
In any case, they're asking me to fill in for him.
In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
Switzerland.
And I get to bring a guest.
Oh, no way, dude!
-Oh, my God, this is incredible.
I'm so happy I'm not gonna question their judgment in picking you.
I'm just gonna run home and start packing.
Wait, why wouldn't you take Penny?
I am taking Penny.
Oh.
Then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.
-Sheldon, you got a minute?
-Of course, my good friend.
Come in.
Yeah, help me out.
Which ski hat says, "AprÃ¨s Super Collider"?
Sheldon, I'm not taking you to Switzerland.
Well, of course you are.
Who else would you take?
-Penny.
-What?
That's absurd.
Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day.
We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snow-capped Alps.
But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
I'm sorry, Sheldon.
Sorry?
I've been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was 9 years old.
I've been dreaming about spending Valentine's with a girl since I was 6.
Shame on you.
That's no dream for a scientist.
-Okay, what's the big surprise?
-Just a minute.
This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine's Day.
Oh, wow, okay.
Let's see.
We've got milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue.
My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is gonna eat all this then I'm gonna climb on his back and rocket to the moon?
No.
But it does involve air travel.
Okay.
Um.
Let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss Army knife and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.
Okay, I'm starting to think "Swiss" is key here.
Uh-huh.
We're going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn.
How does that involve air travel?
We're going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn.
-No.
-Okay, sweetie, this started out fun but I'm over it.
We're going to Switzerland to see the CERN Super Collider.
And ski.
We'll also go skiing.
-We're going skiing in Switzerland?
-You'll ski, I'll fall.
But, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine's Day.
-Oh, my God, Leonard, that's incredible.
-Ha-ha-ha.
Not so fast.
You might wanna hold off on lighting your RÃ¤Ã¤beliechtli, Penny.
My ribee-what-ly?
RÃ¤Ã¤beliechtli, it means turnip light and refers to a lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable to celebrate Swiss festivals which you'll not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall and B, you will not be going to Switzerland.
Sheldon, we've been through this.
I'm taking Penny.
Afraid not.
Do you recognize this?
-Oh, not the roommate agreement.
-Indeed, the roommate agreement.
I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix  Future Commitments.
Number 37: "In the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider now under construction, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him".
Oh, for God's sakes.
You actually put that in an agreement?
We put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.
He can't kill me.
Even if I turn.
Is there anything about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
No, that seemed a little far-fetched.
Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?
I've lived up to my commitments under the agreement.
At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don't care.
I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 p.m. And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.
-I shouldn't ask, but what is--?
-No.
I'd be much further along if I'd been allowed to practice.
Look, Sheldon, I know it's in the agreement.
If you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you.
In fact, I'll even let you eat my brains.
But I'm taking Penny to Switzerland.
-Is that your final decision?
-It is.
Very well.
It's not over, is it?
What do you think?
Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh?
Think it's gonna rain?
Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad.
Thoughts?
I know what'll cheer you up.
Let's play one of your driving games.
All right.
This game is called Traitors.
I will name three historical figures put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal: Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
You're right.
Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
Can't you at least try to understand how much this means to me?
Round two: Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.
Rupert Murdoch?
He owns Fox and they cancelled Firefly.
Hint: He and Darth Vader are tied for number two.
Sorry, I couldn't hang with you.
I had a date with Bernadette.
I know.
I saw the tweet.
-So, what did you end up doing?
-Not much.
Nuked a burrito prayed to Hindu god Urvashi your bowels'd loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.
-You seen Sheldon?
-No.
-Is he still mad about the Super Collider?
-Yeah, he thinks I betrayed him.
What would you guys do if you were me?
I'd take Sheldon to Switzerland.
-Seriously?
-Absolutely.
And I'd leave him there.
What the hell is that?
Uh, let's see.
Yep, 30 pieces of silverware.
Morning, old chum.
-What's going on?
-I've made you breakfast.
Juice, coffee and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters.
See, here's Frodo.
-You made Frodo pancakes?
-Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet.
If you need to void your bladder before eating I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cozy.
Why are you doing this?
It's by way of an apology for my recent behavior.
I've had some time to reflect and I've come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements.
It's the result of two people respecting and caring for each other.
-Butterscotch scone?
-Thanks.
-It's good.
-What you're tasting is respect and affection.
And about a pound of Crisco.
After breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.
You hate Babylon 5.
I do.
It fails as drama, science fiction and it's hopelessly derivative.
But you like it, and you're my friend.
Okay, great.
-Still not taking you to Switzerland.
-Drat.
No Frodo for you.
Hello.
-Hello.
Let's dispense with the friendly banter.
I believe you know why I'm here.
Well, I always figured it was to study us discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.
Yes, amusing.
Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you but let me be more specific.
I believe you know why I'm here in the laundry room.
Better acoustics for your throat singing?
It's actually not bad.
But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation.
Ahem.
Lights.
"Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD should go to Switzerland to see the CERN Super Collider: A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD".
Oh, for God's sakes.
Here, we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind's understanding of the universe, a.k.a. me.
And here, we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger.
A.k.a. you.
Sorry.
Is this supposed to be buttering me up?
Please hold all questions until the end of the presentation.
This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland.
The product of decades of planning and construction.
It is a mecca for physicists the world over.
This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard.
They sell scented soaps and lotions.
Some of which contain glitter.
Now, let's see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.
Okay.
Show's over.
No, it's not.
I've got five more slides.
Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision.
He invited me to Switzerland and I intend to go.
Very well.
Enjoy yourself.
You're gonna be in the presence of something I've dreamed of for decades.
I hope you'll appreciate the magnitude of where you are, and what it represents.
I'll talk to Leonard.
-You will?
-Yes.
If it means that much to you, you should go.
Oh, Penny, thank you.
-You're welcome.
-Since I rarely hug I'm relying on your expertise regarding duration.
-I think we're there.
-Oh, good.
Bye-bye.
Even though I don't have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine's.
Trust me, you can't.
I've tried.
No, no, no.
I'm gonna have a "me" day.
I'm gonna go to one of those spas in Koreatown take a steam, get a massage.
Then I'm gonna stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.
-Sheldon, I need to talk to you.
-All right, my friend.
Would you like some cholermus?
-Some what?
-Cholermus.
It's a traditional Swiss breakfast dish.
I'm preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
-You're not going to Switzerland.
-Oh, but I am.
Didn't Penny tell you the good news?
You went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
Yes, that good news.
Forget it.
I was the one invited, I get to decide who goes with me.
And it's Penny, not you.
Howard, could you lower the lights?
I have a short PowerPoint presentation.
I don't need to see your presentation.
This discussion is over.
Well, that's a somewhat ambiguous response.
Am I going or not?
Sheldon, at this point I would go by myself before I would take you.
-Really?
-Yeah, really.
Well, then.
You leave me no alternative.
From this moment forward, we can be roommates but we will no longer be friends.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I don't think you're fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.
Why don't you enlighten me?
With the friendship clause of our agreement nullified you're no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates' house should I be invited.
Ooh, that's gotta sting.
Think, this time tomorrow, we'll be in Geneva, Switzerland -for our first Valentine's Day.
-I know.
I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
Thermal?
Because it's gonna be cold.
Think it through, Leonard.
-Oh.
-Oh.
Gesundheit.
Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit.
-Getting a cold?
-No, no, it's probably just allergies.
You want an allergy pill?
I have them all.
Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental.
Do any of them work?
Not really, I'm just an enthusiast.
Penny?
You okay?
Did that sound okay to you?
Do not come in here.
What's going on?
I'm having a tea party.
What do you think is going on?
I think I might have the flu.
Or the plague.
Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you'll feel better by then?
Yep.
Because I'm gonna be dead.
Hey, Sheldon?
Listen, Penny's sick and she's not gonna be able to go to Switzerland so if you're still interested, you're welcome to come.
Great.
I'll start packing.
In a minute.
Oh, look, it's the cholermus.
Ugh.
Here's your soup.
-Chicken?
-Yes.
-With the little stars?
-Yes.
Heated to 180 degrees?
Why don't I pour it in your lap and you can tell me?
You don't have to be mean.
I'm sick.
-Yeah, well, I'm sick too.
-Not my problem.
I don't understand how this happened to me.
I'm scrupulous about my hygiene, I regularly disinfect my hands and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.
I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon.
Oh, Penny, thank you.
You're welcome.
It's you.
I touched you.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Oh, my goodness, look at this room.
Champagne, roses, oh, and little chocolates.
This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever.
Yeah, I forgot about all this.
But I never will.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Will you please turn your shirt off?
What?
I'm giving myself dramatic entrance music.
People will know I'm awesome and to be feared.
Right.
There's nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who's got music blasting from between his nipples.
-Hey, Stuart.
What's going on?
-Well, you might wanna mark your Google calendars.
Stan Lee is coming to do a signing on Thursday.
Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography?
I'm sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.
No, just a regular comic signing.
My uncle is his dermatologist, and Stan's doing him a favor.
Oh, I don't wanna know that.
How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?
Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
Well, look who thinks he's Stuart's uncle now.
Can't believe it.
We're gonna meet Stan Lee.
I'm so excited And I just can't hide it I'm about to lose control And I think I like it I'm sad to say I taught him those moves.
I can't decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey Into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four Number 5, first appearance of Dr. Doom.
Alex, I'm gonna go with: "What is you're a dumb-ass"?
I've decided I'm going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month's Batman.
That's crazy.
Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.
Which is why no one else will ask him to sign one.
I'll be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing artifact which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic-book fandom.
That's a great idea.
I'm gonna get him to sign a Batman as well.
What is it about the word "unique" you don't understand?
Ow!
Damn.
Paper cut.
Nothing worse than a paper cut.
Well, obviously, you don't remember your circumcision.
There's Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.
Why don't you keep that stuff in the bathroom?
He does.
And in the kitchen, and in the car, and in his pocket.
Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.
-Hi.
-Hey.
Guess who's gonna be at the comic store on Thursday.
-Um, can you give me a hint?
-Stan Lee.
Um, Stanley.
Stanley.
Stanley Tucci?
No, ha, ha.
No.
Stan Lee.
Oh.
Oh, Stan Lee.
Cool.
You have no idea who he is, do you?
Of course I do.
You're an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.
-Good.
Good.
-Heh, heh.
So who's Stan Lee?
Um, he was on Star Trek.
-No.
-Star Wars?
No.
Um, Stan Lee.
Oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?
That's Bruce Lee.
Oh.
So is this Bruce Lee's nerdy brother, Stan?
Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?
Because most of the things I'm planning to buy haven't been invented yet.
There must be thousands of dollars here.
-Why don't you put it in the bank?
-I don't trust banks.
I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge.
You've also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.
Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are in the wrong order.
It's supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.
I'm sorry, you sent more than one letter about that?
It bothers me.
-Sheldon, this is a summons.
-A summons?
For what?
Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16th.
They got you on a traffic camera.
Nice picture.
November 16th?
Penny, that's the evening you fell in your bathtub.
I had to drive you to the emergency room.
No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.
I have an eidetic memory.
That's a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.
Hmm.
No, it isn't.
Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?
Okay, look, they sent me the ticket.
I told them I wasn't driving, and they were all, "Who was it"?
-So you betrayed me.
-No.
It wasn't a betrayal.
It was more of a, I can't afford any more points on my license.
I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.
But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress, and I was rescuing you.
Yes.
And look, now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.
It's not that big a deal.
You just go down to the court on Thursday, and you pay the fine.
I'm not going to pay a fine.
That would imply I'm guilty.
You are guilty.
-That one I liked.
-Yeah.
I am not guilty.
I only have a learner's permit.
Penny was the teacher.
When the light turned yellow she said, "Go, go, go," so I went, went, went.
Sheldon, I'm sorry.
I'll be happy to reimburse you for the fine.
You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.
You don't need to reimburse me.
I'm not paying.
On Thursday, I will have my day in court, and justice will be done.
In fact, I'm going to begin preparing my defense right now.
Okay, he's going to jail.
Oh, that's right.
Thursday's Stan Lee day.
Now you see what you've done?
Because of you, we're all going to miss Stan Lee.
Whoa!
-What do you mean "all"?
-Well, you're my friends.
You'll be standing by my side, supporting me feeding me legal precedents, and, if you have the strength carrying me out on your shoulders when I'm victorious.
Yeah, okay, no.
Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?
That's what I'm saying.
-Howard?
-Wow.
Ahem.
Uh, Stan Lee or you in court.
Uh, if this was Sophie's Choice, it would've been a much shorter movie.
No.
Raj, you'll be there, won't you?
All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me.
So I guess it'll just be me and my eyewitness.
Oh, balls.
Try to wear something appropriate.
It won't help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word "Juicy" scrawled across your buttocks.
Penny.
Penny.
Penny.
-That's just wrong.
-All right, let's go.
Wait.
Hold on.
Before we get to the courthouse I'd like to call on your skills as an actress.
What is this?
I've taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand.
You're somewhat of a loose cannon.
Don't worry, it's written in your vernacular.
So shall we rehearse?
-Do I have a choice?
-Of course you have a choice.
Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will.
Now, sit down.
"I call your attention to the events of November 16th.
Do you remember that date"?
"Darn tooting, I do.
If the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed, Nebraskan turn of phrase".
-Excellent.
Go on.
-"The reason that date is, like so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I've ever seen in, like, ever".
"And who performed that heroic act"?
"Why, you did, sir.
You, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
And may I add, it is a privilege to know you".
"There's no need for compliments.
This court is only interested in the facts".
"But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you.
Totally".
"A teardrop rolls down my cheek"?
Only a suggestion.
A catch in your throat would work just as well.
"But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you.
Totally".
Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.
Pay the cashier.
Sheldon Cooper.
Good morning, Your Honor.
Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se.
That is to say, representing himself.
I know what it means.
I went to law school.
And yet you wound up in traffic court.
If it would please the court, I'd like to begin with an opening statement.
The court would advise you to make it quick.
The court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito and just took an Imodium.
Very well.
A quick opening statement.
Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs.
I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic.
I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal.
But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue.
I am unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera.
So to sum up, improper instruction quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment.
My milk stool is complete.
-Impressive.
-Thank you.
Guilty.
Pay the cashier.
I object.
You're completely ignoring the law.
No, I'm following the law.
I'm ignoring you.
Really?
I would point out that I am at the top of my profession while you preside over the kiddie table of yours.
Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail I'm gonna give you a chance to apologize for that last remark.
I'm a scientist.
I never apologize for the truth.
That's my spot.
I can't wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.
Oh, come on.
Why would you do that?
Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker.
Oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson Jr. Okay, I'm cutting.
I'm not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off.
-Hey.
-Sheldon's in jail.
-Sheldon's in jail?
-You called it.
-For what?
What do you think?
For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge.
-He has to stay there until he apologizes.
-So tell him to apologize.
Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard.
That didn't occur to me.
If he doesn't apologize by 5:00, he's gonna spend the night in jail.
Oh, no, that's terrible.
The line's moving.
Gotta go.
Bye.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, jailor?
-What?
-I need to use the restroom.
Knock yourself out.
-That's the toilet?
-Well, it ain't a wishing well.
Please tell the judge I'm ready to apologize.
Look at that.
"To my friend Leonard.
From Stan Lee.
Excelsior"!
Awesome.
Mine says: "To my friend Howard.
From Stan Lee.
Excelsior"!
Mine says, "To Raj.
From Stan Lee".
That's because you pissed him off about his character names.
I didn't even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor von Doom.
Oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model.
We're home.
-Oh, hey, buddy.
How'd it go?
-You know very well how it went.
Yeah.
But we all wanna hear it from you.
-I was found guilty and fined $533.
-I'm gonna write you a check for that.
As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it like the others.
I also now have three points on a driver's license I do not yet possess and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology because I refused to urinate in a stainless-steel bowl in front of criminals.
Plus, you didn't get to meet Stan Lee.
Okay, that's enough, Howard.
The poor guy's had a tough time.
He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.
It would be cruel to mention that, after he finished signing autographs Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato.
You had gelato with Stan Lee?
He said we could call him Stan.
Except for Raj.
Well, I hope you're satisfied, Penny.
You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.
-I realize--  Not finished.
It is because of you that I now have a criminal record.
And it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.
-Maybe you'll have another chance-- -No.
I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime.
The moving finger writes and, having writ, moves on.
Did he just somehow give me the finger?
Not just the finger, the moving finger.
Hey, Stuart.
Oh, hey, Penny.
Wow.
Hi.
-What's going on?
-Nothing.
I'm just getting ready to close up and head out.
-Cool.
Got any fun plans?
-Oh, yeah.
Big night tonight.
Gonna share a can of tuna with the cat.
Oh, nice.
Not even my cat.
I just feed it.
Some nights, it doesn't even show up.
Oh, okay.
Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favor.
Sure, yeah.
Name it.
I'm kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee.
I really wanna make it up to him.
I was hoping you could give me his number so I can arrange for them to meet.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't have his phone number.
Damn.
All right.
Thank you.
Mm-hm.
Wait.
I have his address.
Really?
Great.
But I can't give it to you.
-Then why did you tell me you had it?
-I don't know.
Just chatting.
You're looking at a guy who could very well get stood up by a stray cat tonight.
I'm sorry, Stuart.
Thanks anyway.
Mm-hm.
Wait.
-Yeah?
-Maybe we can make a deal.
What kind of deal?
I will give you the address if you go to my cousin's wedding with me.
-You're extorting a date out of me?
-I kind of have to.
The cousin who's getting married is the cousin I usually go to weddings with.
-Can I bring Leonard?
-Sure.
What the hell?
-Deal.
-We'll tell people he's your cousin.
This is Stan Lee's front door.
We were on Stan Lee's curb, then we were on Stan Lee's walk -and now we're at Stan Lee's front door.
-Yep.
Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee's doorbell at Stan Lee's house.
We're about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.
Sweetie, I don't know if we're gonna have cookies or what's gonna happen so just let me talk and-- Yeah?
-Are you Stan Lee?
-Oh, damn.
Hi.
I'm Penny.
This is my friend Sheldon.
We're not friends at the moment.
Depends on how this goes.
Right, right.
Anyway, Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours.
He was supposed to meet you the other day, but he kind of ended up in jail.
I see.
And you thought you'd just come over to my house uninvited?
You said we were invited.
Oh, no, no.
I said I'm inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee's house.
You know, you fanboys are unbelievable.
Do you think you can just ring my doorbell anytime you want?
I mean, why don't you just come on in and watch the Lakers game with me?
Well, I'm not much of a sports fan, but thank you.
I'm sorry.
He doesn't really understand sarcasm.
Well, I'll give him something he'll understand.
-Joanie, call the police.
-Nice to meet you.
Fantastic Four, Daredevil Invincible Iron Man, Happy Hogan, Curt Connors-- Would you just let it go?
And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom.
-Hey.
Where you been?
-I'll tell you where I've been.
You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order.
Sweet.
Plus, I get to hang out with him again, at the hearing.
This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
Well, it's very simple.
In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose I'm the smart one.
Wolowitz is the funny one.
Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails.
That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.
One more floor and I'd be the pulled muscle.
Oh, it's about time.
I'm starving.
Uh, well, we didn't actually get Chinese food.
-Why not?
-Don't panic.
This is better.
Oh, no.
You didn't trade the food for magic beans, did you?
Of course not.
And, technically, magic beans would be food.
Eating them would be a waste, since you could plant them and have a giant beanstalk which would provide roughage for a small city.
Yeah, sometimes I don't listen.
Sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.
We were on our way to the restaurant.
We saw Adam West, so we followed him.
-Who's Adam West?
-Who's Adam West?
What do the two of you talk about after the coitus?
My guess is, "Hey, four minutes.
New record".
That's why I'm the funny one.
Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale.
They had the coolest stuff.
They were closing up.
We got this whole box for 60 bucks.
We didn't go through it.
There could be anything.
There a new girlfriend in there?
You might need one.
No, but there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains.
Oh, you're right, it's Ghostbusters ll.
Never mind.
Oh, my God.
An ALF doll.
When I was 11, my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left.
I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac and ALF was gonna bring him back to me.
But he never did.
Where's my daddy, puppet?
Where is he?
That is so sad.
No, what's sad is that you don't know that Adam West was TV's Batman.
Here's Spock's head with no body.
Here's Mr. T's body with no head.
Oh, yeah, here's Spock's body with Mr. T's head.
"I pity the fool who's illogical".
I'm just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.
- Okay, bye.
-Okay.
Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.
And an Aquaman action figure.
Looks like someone drew a penis on him.
Eh.
That'll come off.
You see what you're doing?
Stop that.
-Fascinating.
-What?
-It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
Oh.
It's even got the Elvish engraving on it.
It's not Elvish.
It's the language of Mordor written in Elvish script.
"One ring to rule them all".
"One ring to find them".
"One ring to bring them all".
"And in the darkness, bind them".
Holy crap, are we nerdy.
So I was doing some checking on the ring.
Hold on.
Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?
Yes, there is.
Oh, here's a fun fact.
Ketchup started out as a general term for sauce typically made of mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices.
Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy oyster, kidney bean and grape.
No, that's okay, I'll get it.
Listen, I was looking at the ring and it seemed a little weird.
No copyright notice on it.
So I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.
Seedy underbelly?
Uh, your black-market phasers your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff.
Who's this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?
Just a guy.
I know a guy.
-Is it Eddie Crispo?
-No, I can't tell you who it is.
-Who else could it be?
It has to be.
-I know lots of dangerous people.
-Name one.
-Eddie Crispo.
Anyway, he said this isn't a replica.
It's the real deal.
If you're suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever-so-slight amusement.
He's not saying it's a magic ring.
You're not, are you?
No, but it's close.
Look at the markings inside.
Those are production markings.
Nine rings were made for use in the movies.
Three were given to members of the cast.
The rest were destroyed.
Except one.
One was stolen.
Gentlemen, this is the One Ring.
Mine.
No, it is not yours.
We all went in on the box together.
Yes, but I found it in the box.
And the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner.
How is this maritime salvage?
Other than the lack of water, how is it not?
Wait, Sheldon.
Stop being crazy for a second.
How much is something like this worth?
Well, it's tough to say, since it's hot.
On the underground market, my guy figures-- -Your guy Eddie Crispo?
-Yes.
-He figures 10-, maybe 15,000.
-Okay, that's a lot of money.
The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical.
Like a Jet Ski.
Why do you want a Jet Ski?
All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis.
-That can't just be a coincidence.
Ugh.
We can't sell it.
We have to keep it and love it and polish it.
Take it out occasionally when we go to the park and reenact our favorite scenes from the movies.
It's sad how great that sounds.
Guys, it's stolen.
It should go back to Peter Jackson.
-He made the movies.
It belongs to him.
Fine.
He can have it back.
As long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.
But there are no Jewish hobbits.
Clearly, you've never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.
We are not blackmailing Peter-- -All right, where's the ring?
-You mean my ring?
-What are you doing?
-The ring was unguarded.
It was sitting on the table.
Anyone could've taken it.
Proof?
I did.
Give me that.
Be reasonable.
We want to do different things with the ring.
But your ideas are stupid and I want a Jet Ski.
I found it.
The ring is mine.
I don't understand why in this group I never get my way.
You always get your way.
I'll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
Hey.
Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food but bringing you a box of random crap?
Yeah, it's delicious.
The sarcasm's a little stale, though.
How about this?
Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds it.
-What ring?
-This ring.
Looking for something?
-Will you hold this for a couple of days?
-Why?
It's a prop from a movie and we're kind of fighting over it.
The first piece of jewelry my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie and I don't even get to keep it?
If you had gone out with me years ago you'd have my Aunt Ida's brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.
How am I looking now?
You hit me!
I'm bleeding!
What was that?
Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.
That's my girl.
So, Sheldon, how's it feel to get beaten up by a girl?
It's not the first time.
I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero.
If only I'd had the presence of mind to reabsorb her.
I'd have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.
Have you come to the realization that the only reasonable action is to sell the ring and divide the money?
-No.
-I was afraid of that.
Go ahead.
Greetings from Mumbai.
I'm Raj's attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.
Also my cousin.
-You brought a lawyer?
-Don't answer that.
I'll get straight to the point.
My client's prepared to surrender any interest in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.
We're not giving him two Jet Skis.
Look, we're big boys.
Why don't we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle?
One Kawasaki Jet Ski.
Done and done.
No Jet Skis.
All right, forget the Jet Skis.
Forget the Jet Skis?
What happened to "tear them a new one"?
What can I say?
They played hardball.
We lost.
-You're useless.
-I told you that when you hired me.
I'm signing off now.
-Call your mother.
She worries.
So you know, if we're bringing in cousins who are lawyers prepare for shock and awe.
You know, I am ending this.
Penny didn't wanna hold the ring.
She gave it to me.
I have it.
I'm sending it back.
-Where's the ring?
-You mean this ring?
Be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men's room.
-Give me that.
-No, it's mine.
It's all of ours.
Okay, this is ridiculous.
-Then let go!
-I'm not.
You let go.
I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.
Fine.
Can't we go home and start?
Sure.
Let go of the ring.
All right.
It starts now.
You do realize there's a giant-bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel.
Wait, my laptop.
Yeah, there's a point when this becomes idiotic.
And it wasn't when we were driving like this?
I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile.
I have endless patience.
I spent two and a half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
You wanna talk about endless patience?
Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.
There's six seasons, dude.
Oh, crap.
No, no, no, the sixth season is great.
We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken and then Mr. Big shows up.
We don't know if we can trust him again.
It's a wild ride.
Door.
Okay, everybody, and pliÃ©.
And relevÃ©.
What are you doing?
Last one holding the ring decides its fate.
I know it sounds silly.
No, no, no.
You are my boyfriend.
Nothing you do is silly to me.
Thank you.
FYI, this is a bag from Victoria's Secret.
I'm out.
I'm sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office.
No, he doesn't.
He's lying to you.
Will you be quiet?
Well, if you want privacy, let go of the ring.
I'm so glad we came to this gentile strip club.
Howard, here's more bacon to tuck into the shiksa's G-string.
I'll call you back.
It's lovely you call your mommy and let her know you're going to be late.
From what I know, if a woman doesn't breast-feed on time it's very uncomfortable for her boobies.
Don't you talk about my mother's boobies.
If you're offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother's boobies.
Excellent.
Tire each other out.
The ring will be mine.
Howard, why don't you go after Raj's mother?
Why don't we go after your mother?
Go ahead.
I have no illusions about my mother.
She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr Pepper addiction.
Anything you'd like to add?
That's not gonna get you anywhere.
Better pull out the big gun.
You're right.
Let's talk about your grandmother.
No.
I call no meemaws.
Think about this.
The only way your mother was born was your meemaw had sex.
-I don't wanna hear this.
-Then let go of the ring and walk away.
-Never.
-All right.
I'll bet your meemaw didn't just have sex to have your mother I bet she had sex  because she liked it.
-Stop it.
-Yeah.
Meemaw did the nasty.
-I said stop it!
RAJESH &  Ha-ha-ha.
- We're getting to him.
-Waterfalls.
-What?
-Waterfalls.
Crashing waves, babbling brooks.
-What are you doing?
-Subliminal messaging.
I'm going to make you want to pee.
Dripping faucets.
Leaky gutter.
Peeing.
It's not working, dude.
Oh-ho-ho.
It's working, all right.
I have to pee.
-Then let go of the ring and go.
-Actually, I wouldn't mind going too.
Heh.
Fine, um, on the count of three.
One, two-- Wait, just to clarify, when you get to three do we stand up or do we pee?
We stand up.
Excellent choice.
Three.
Oh.
Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.
I've done it.
I've won.
The ring is mine.
It's mine!
We're going to clean it up and make it pretty.
My own, my love   Where's the ring?
It's in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
The fires of Mount Doom?
Peter Jackson's office in New Zealand.
It wasn't ours.
You quit the game.
You had no right to take it.
You guys were sleeping.
The ring was on the floor.
No one was touching it.
So we start the game over until there's a winner.
There wasn't ever going to be a winner.
There was going to be a selfish person and three people who used to be his friend.
Is that what you guys want?
If it is, fine.
I don't want anything to do with you.
I don't know what happened in that bathroom, but I'm not cleaning it.
My precious.
I knew it.
-Give us the precious.
-Never!
Never.
-Give it to me.
-Get off of me.
-Give me the ring.
-It's mine.
I gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.
-Give it back.
-Give it to me.
Give me the ring!
-I said give it to me.
-It's mine!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Okay, in Avatar when they have sex on Pandora they hook up their ponytails.
So we know their ponytails are like their junk.
Yeah.
So?
When they ride horses and fly on birds -they also use their ponytails.
-Your point?
My point is if I were a horse or a bird I'd be very nervous around James Cameron.
It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are important things in the world to worry about.
For example, why wasn't William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?
Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of the Chancellor's Award for Science.
You wanna rub my nose in the fact my contributions are being overlooked again?
I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics.
All right, I'll play.
What self-important preening fraud are they honoring this year?
Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that.
You.
-I won?
-You won.
I won.
This is astonishing.
Not that I won the award.
No one deserves it more.
Actually, I guess I misspoke.
It's not astonishing.
It's more like inevitable.
Not sure what to do.
Maybe call my mother.
Wait.
I'm gonna conduct an interview with myself and post it online.
Well, good for him.
Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost.
Did it look like that spear was gonna go right through your skull?
No.
Hey, you didn't want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don't get glasses.
Oh.
That will be another congratulatory call for me.
-Mute, please.
-Wait.
Hang on.
Flaming arrow.
Hello?
Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir?
Yes, I was expecting your call.
Three years ago.
I see.
What happens if I choose not to give a speech?
Uh-huh.
And if I don't want to forfeit the award?
Well, you've got that tied up in a neat little bow.
All right, thank you.
-Problem.
-What?
They expect me to give a speech at the banquet.
I can't give a speech.
Well, no, you're mistaken.
You give speeches all the time.
What you can't do is shut up.
Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown.
Turned brown while you were talking.
I'm perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups.
I cannot speak to large crowds.
What to you is a large crowd?
Any group big enough to trample me to death.
General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
Sheldon.
Congratulations.
Brought you cheesecake from work.
You know, because of your award, not because that busboy sneezed on it.
-I'm not accepting the award.
-Why not?
Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.
That's no reason to back out.
I once got a pretty big honor in high school.
I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd but I went through with it.
You know?
The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the corn queen's court.
Thank you.
I'll bear that in mind if I'm ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.
-Sheldon, you're being ridiculous.
-Am I?
Let me tell you a story.
Where's 70 children when you need them?
I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college.
"Summa cum laude" is Latin for "with highest honors".
I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.
I was valedictorian and expected to give an address.
Even now I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd.
There must have been thousands of people.
My heart started pounding in my chest.
I began to hyperventilate.
My vision became blurry, and before I knew it-- Oh, dear.
-Oh, my God.
Sheldon?
-Sheldon, are you okay?
-Don't trample me.
Come on, Mother, you know why I can't accept the award.
With all due respect, I don't think praying will help.
No, I have not heard the song "Jesus, Take the Wheel".
No, no, no.
You don't need to start singing it.
Yes, I'll buy it on "the iTunes," Mother.
Goodbye, Mother.
Hello.
-Sit down.
We wanna talk to you.
-Am I in trouble?
Did my mother call you?
Just sit.
We think we can help you with your stage fright.
Oh, I doubt that.
I haven't figured out a way and I'm much smarter than all of you.
Yes, but you're not smarter than all of us put together.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That is what I meant.
Okay.
Your problem is you're trying to do this all by yourself.
We could help you.
We can be your team.
Like Professor Xavier and his X-Men.
I do like the X-Men.
Did I see X-Men?
Yeah, we watched it last week.
You said you liked it.
Oh, I say a lot of things, sweetie.
So how about it, Sheldon?
I don't know.
If you're my X-Men, what are your powers?
Okay, well, I'm gonna take you shopping, get you a nice suit.
-Might give you more confidence.
-It's not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters but go on.
Leonard?
I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?
My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist and I've been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast feeding co-dependently.
And Raj says he can teach you-- What did you call it?
I don't know, some Indian meditation crap.
I see.
I assume since the rest of you have set the bar so low you're saving the most impressive contribution for last.
Go ahead, Howard.
Dazzle me.
My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems.
And that's 24/7, buddy.
And I appreciate the pretense.
So, what do you say, Sheldon?
Are we your X-Men?
No.
The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier.
Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.
Oh, that's not a good name.
These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears.
And yet you can't speak to women.
But thanks to meditation I'm able to stay in the same room with them without urinating.
Now, ahem, close your eyes.
Okay, but don't punch me.
-What?
-When I was little my sister would say: "Close your eyes, you'll get a surprise".
And then she'd punch me.
-I'm not going to punch you.
-That's what my sister used to say.
-Look, do you wanna do this or not?
-I'm sorry.
Proceed.
All right, ahem imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home.
-Where is that?
-SimCity.
More specifically, the SimCity I designed, Sheldonopolis.
Okay, you're in Sheldonopolis.
Where exactly?
Sheldon Square?
Sheldon Towers?
Sheldon Stadium, home of the fighting Sheldons?
Whatever you like.
I thought this was supposed to be guided meditation.
Fine, you're in Sheldon Square.
Really?
This time of the year?
It's a bit nippy.
Then put on a sweater.
Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Just go buy a sweater.
The nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15 percent discount.
You own the damn thing, just take a freaking sweater.
I didn't turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly.
All right.
You've paid for a sweater and you're in Sheldon Square.
Ahem.
Hang on.
It's a cardigan, I have to button it.
-Oh, no.
-What now?
A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city.
I have to get my people to safety.
People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor.
Follow me.
If the children can't run, leave them behind.
Oh, the simulated horror.
Raj?
Just as I suspected.
Meditation is nothing but hokum.
I question your premise.
How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?
It'll give you confidence.
Sometimes when I'm feeling stressed out I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.
Don't you eventually realize you're the same stressed-out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
Yeah, that's when I buy shoes.
Now, let's see what we got.
Oh.
This is nice.
It's only one color.
Yes, so?
That's a lot of money for only one color.
Fine.
Why don't you pick out what you like?
Hmm.
This is pretty sharp.
No.
You're wrong.
This is great.
I had a suit like this when I was six.
Okay, I think we have a winner.
-Where the hell did you find that?
-In the prom department.
It's ridiculous.
Says the former member of the corn queen's court.
-Please just try this one on?
-Okay.
But anything I put on now is only gonna suffer in comparison.
This is absurd.
I look like a clown.
So, Sheldon how you doing?
That's how you start a psychotherapy session?
How am I doing?
I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious.
Instead I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph's.
I'm sorry.
I'll start again.
Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?
Um.
I don't know, maybe.
I recently had a dream that I was a giant.
But everything around me was to scale so it all looked normal.
Well, how did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
I was wearing size a million pants.
-Why don't we just talk?
-Ah.
The talking cure.
Classical Freudian.
Good choice.
If it will help speed things along my answers to the standard Rorschach inkblot test are: A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.
Why don't I just start?
Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if on a subconscious level, they don't feel they deserve them.
Do you think maybe that's what's happening here?
Really, Leonard?
You just going to try to recycle Adler's doctrine of the inferiority complex?
I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph's.
And she'd let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.
But it could be part of your problem.
Let me give you an example.
When I was 8, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.
But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother's earlier Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock 'n' Roll.
I felt so guilty I gave the ribbon back.
And how did that make you feel?
Terrible.
I worked really hard on that project.
I stayed up all night singing the clown's aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
Go on.
It wasn't my fault.
I had never seen my brother's project.
And my mother could've told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
So I hear you saying you're angry with your mother.
Damn right, I'm angry with my mother.
For God's sake, I was 8 years old.
She humiliated me.
That's when the bed-wetting started again.
-Thank you, Leonard.
-For what?
If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning I think I can face a simple awards ceremony.
Wait, that's it?
I thought we had a whole hour.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
It is my great honor to introduce the winner of this year's Chancellor's Award for Science, and my good friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
But before I do, I'd like to share with you a letter from Sheldon's mother, who couldn't be here tonight.
Isn't that nice?
His mother sent him a letter.
She's proud of him.
Wonder what that feels like.
"Dear Shelly".
That's what she calls him.
Shelly.
It's a pet name.
You know what my mother's pet name for me is?
Leonard.
But I digress.
-"Dear Shelly, I am so proud" -Oh, dear.
-What's the matter?
-I'm getting dizzy.
Don't worry.
You're surrounded by your C-Men.
I can't do this.
I'm going to faint.
All right, drink this.
It'll relax you.
-Alcohol?
I don't drink alcohol.
-Fine, faint.
I don't feel different.
This alcohol's defective.
Here.
See if this one works.
First of all, the projects were totally different.
I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow.
But my mother didn't hear me.
If you look at the relationship between nurturing and growth I'd like to point out that my brother is 8 inches taller than me.
I'm ready!
Right.
Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honor Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Thanks, shorty.
I'll take it from here.
All right, you people ready to have some fun?
You have an understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology?
Well, here come the jokes.
Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip?
To get to the same side?
Buzzinga.
A neutron walks into a bar and asks, "How much for a drink"?
The bartender says, "For you, no charge".
Hello?
I know you're out there.
I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide.
It looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience.
Dr. Randall from the geology department only man who's happy when they take his work for granite.
Bada-cha.
I kid the geologists, of course but it's only because I have no respect for the field.
Let's get serious for a moment.
Why are we all here?
Because we're scientists.
And what do scientists study?
The universe.
And what's the universe made of?
I am so glad you asked.
There's antimony, arsenic Aluminum, selenium Hydrogen and oxygen And nitrogen and rhenium And nickel, neodymium Neptunium, germanium Everybody!
And iron, americium Ruthenium, uranium Europium, zirconium Lutetium, vanadium Just the Asians!
And lanthanum and osmium And astatine and radium Penny, Leonard.
Would you be able to answer some questions I'm having about the events of last night?
-Sure.
-Question one.
Where are my pants?
You might wanna check YouTube.
-What do I search?
-It's already loaded.
Just hit play.
All right, people, let's get down to the math.
It is only three-dimensional thinking that limits our imagination.
Can I take my pants off over my head?
Of course not, my body's in the way.
But if we had access to higher dimensions we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over.
Oh, Lord, this couldn't be any more humiliating.
Oh.
Give it a minute.
Now for the astronomers in the audience get ready to see the dark side of the moon.
And here's Uranus.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Having a little trouble catching your breath, there?
No, I'm good.
If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for I would have tried a lot harder.
Do or do not, there is no try.
Heh.
Did you just quote Star Wars?
I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.
Ha, ha.
Oh, my God.
I am lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda.
I love you, Penny.
Uh.
Heh.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
-I just wanted to put that out there.
-Oh, yeah.
No, I-- -I'm glad.
-Yeah-- Oh, good.
-Good.
Glad is good.
-Yeah.
Ha.
Ahem.
No-- Um.
So, heh.
It's getting pretty late.
We should, tsk, go to sleep.
-Yeah.
-Okay.
Yeah, probably.
-Okay.
Good night, sweetie.
-Good night.
Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?
Sheldon says impossible, Howard and I say not only possible but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than the Batmobile.
You are ignoring the square-cube law.
The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its exoskeleton.
For the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jetpack, hover board, transporter, Batmobile and then giant ant.
Seriously, you have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
-What's with him?
-Perhaps he's at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
Are you saying he's man-struating?
Not literally.
But as far back as the 17th century scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men's hormone levels.
Interesting.
That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month.
You know what I'm talking about.
Okay, forget giant ants.
How about giant rabbits?
Big or small, I don't like rabbits.
They always look like they're about to say something, but they never do.
Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size.
On a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.
Maybe that's what they wanna talk about.
Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?
I honestly don't care.
Really?
Every time we've talked about unusual animal genitals you've always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.
What do you want?
I just don't give a rat's ass.
Would that be a giant rat's ass?
For the record, giant rats are possible.
Can we please talk about something else?
Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
Okay, how about this for a topic: "Why is Leonard being a giant douche"?
Assuming giant douches are possible.
Of course they are.
Leonard's being one.
-Maybe he's having a spat with Penny.
-No.
There was no spat.
-Oh, but something happened.
-I don't wanna talk about it.
But I sense you're going to and I don't wanna hear about it.
Excuse me.
What'd you do, Romeo?
Did you pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?
Think it would be funny to put on her panties and jump around but it wound up just creeping her out?
-What?
No.
-Just asking, dude.
It happens.
You guys still on for bowling tonight?
Oh, yes.
In fact, I've prepared some trash talk for the occasion.
Ahem.
You bowl like your mama.
Unless she bowls well.
In which case, you bowl nothing like her.
Oh.
Ouch.
That is what is referred to as "a burn on you".
-Did you ask her to start waxing?
-No.
-Did you start waxing?
-No.
While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out, "Mommy"?
I'm walking away from you now.
-That wasn't a no.
-Yeah.
Think we're getting close.
Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her?
Because you can die that way.
Oh, that would be a good way to go.
-Hi.
-Oh, hey.
Good, Penny.
Reminder, bowling tonight at 7:00.
Oh, right.
Bowling.
You don't have to come if you don't want.
No, no, it's okay.
I mean, let's face it, you would get creamed without me.
We would indeed.
In this particular case your lack of femininity works to our advantage.
Yeah.
It's always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.
-Sarcasm?
Thinly veiled contempt.
-Remember, 7:00.
Got it.
-Pacific Daylight Time.
Bite me.
Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.
These are my own bowling shoes.
Then what's with the disinfectant?
I know where my feet have been.
Hey, Penny.
And you guys.
Albino Bob couldn't make it, so I brought a substitute.
I believe some of you know Wil Wheaton.
Hi, Sheldon.
How's it going?
Well, well, well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton.
The Green Goblin to my Spider-Man.
The Pope Paul V to my Galileo.
The Internet Explorer to my Firefox.
Not carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?
I'm the proud owner of Wil-Wheaton-stinks.com dot-net and dot-org.
What does that tell you?
It tells me that I am living rent-free right here.
-You ready to bowl?
-Oh, I'm ready.
I don't know if Stuart told you what you're up against but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League Championship team.
Seven-to-12-year-old division.
Also, Penny's pretty good.
Great.
Then it's on.
Foolish Wil Wheaton.
It was never off.
Yes!
A common spare.
The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant.
Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment watch how it's really done.
I am the ball.
My thoughts are its thoughts.
Its holes are my holes.
Yes.
Tweet that, Tweety Bird.
-I just wanted to tell you I'm a big fan.
-Oh, thanks.
I'm sure you're probably sick of Star Trek questions but Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?
Ah.
Beer.
The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party.
Oh, yeah.
-Chili-cheese fry?
-Yes.
I love chili-cheese fries.
-Really?
You love them?
-Yeah, why?
No reason.
Just glad to hear you're comfortable saying you love something.
-You wanna get into this right now?
-Get into what?
Why wouldn't you love the chili-cheese fries?
They've been in your life a long time.
They make you happy.
They deserve to know.
Okay, look, you caught me by surprise last night.
I didn't know what to say.
Now you've had time to think about it.
What do you wanna say?
-I'm not sure.
-How can you not be sure?
-This isn't the place to have this.
-No.
The place was in bed after I said, "I love you" and you said, "Thank you.
Good night".
-Don't push it, Leonard.
-I am not pushing anything.
You are.
You don't get to decide when I'm ready to say "I love you".
Ah.
The premature "I love you".
I guessed premature.
Does that count?
Penny.
Penny.
Penny.
-What?
-This is for you.
-Ice cream?
-I've been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip "Cathy".
When she's upset, she says "ack" and eats ice cream.
Um.
Ack.
And if you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.
Did Leonard send you over here?
No.
We haven't spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer, Wil Wheaton.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
Not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.
-Again, I'm sorry.
-Let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morissette.
-You're kidding.
-No.
Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
What part of this is supposed to make me feel better?
The part where I tell you I've engineered a rematch with Stuart's team for tonight.
Oh, honey, I don't know.
Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.
You want me to remove him from the team?
I'm the captain, I can do that.
No, no, that's okay.
Just let me talk to him and I'll get back to you.
-When are you going to talk to him?
-I don't know.
He's in the laundry room now.
Now would be a good time.
You're not gonna leave me until I do it?
Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.
-I think we should talk now.
-What?
No, it's okay.
We don't have to talk because there's nothing to talk about.
-Everything's good.
-Really?
So you didn't get snarky because I said something nice to a bowl of chili fries?
All right, maybe I overreacted.
So we're in two different places, emotionally.
So what?
And maybe I'm a little ahead of you, and that's fine.
In fact, it makes sense, because let's face it I've been in this relationship two years longer than you.
Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you.
It's just that I've said the L word too soon before and it didn't work out very well.
Really?
I wouldn't know what that's like.
I'm sorry.
-You know what I'm talking about.
-Yeah, I do.
-So we're good?
-Yes, that's what I'm telling you.
We are good.
We are great.
All right.
Fence mended, problem swept under the rug.
Time to bowl.
Yes, I was eavesdropping.
There's a lot at stake.
Attention, all bowlers I've taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.
-The Wesley Crushers?
-No, not the Wesley Crushers.
The Wesley "Crushers".
-I don't get it.
-Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton's character on Star Trek.
Still don't get it.
It's a blindingly clever play on words.
By appropriating his character's name and adding the S we imply that we will be the crushers of Wesley.
I'm sorry, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like people who like Wesley Crusher.
No, again, it's not the Wesley Crushers.
It's the Wesley "Crushers".
No, if you want it to mean you're crushing Wesley it'd be the "Wesley" Crushers.
Do you people even hear yourselves?
It's not the Wesley Crushers.
It's not the "Wesley" Crushers, it's Wesley "Crushers".
Hey, look.
They named their team after me.
No, it's not-- Never mind.
So we're all clear on the bet and the stakes?
Oh, yes.
The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor.
FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Belakovsky hypotheses.
Ouch again.
Hey, Sheldon.
I wanted you to know I'm looking forward to wiping the floor with you.
Oh, yes?
Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question.
Is your mother a good or poor bowler?
-After you.
-No, after you.
As we are currently crushing you, Wesley.
It's customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.
All right.
It's a custom, not a rule.
I so loathe you.
That's right, Sheldon.
Embrace the dark side.
That's not even from your franchise.
I, um-- I want you to know that even though we're on opposite sides I bear you no ill will.
-Thank you, Stuart.
It's nice to know.
-Mm-hm.
People from opposite sides often have good relationships.
You know, Romeo and Juliet Tony and Maria from West Side Story.
What's-his-name and the big, blue chick in Avatar.
I'm gonna bowl now.
Be the ball, Howard.
Leave me alone, Sheldon.
You weren't the ball.
Hey, thanks.
-This is fun, huh?
-Yeah.
It's good we got out and did something physical.
-Mm-hm.
-Gets us out of our heads.
You get in your head you start to over-think, over-analyze, obsess, you worry.
That's not what we're doing tonight.
We're throwing a ball at some pins.
-Yeah, that's right.
-Mm-hm.
And someday, we don't know when, maybe you'll love me back.
Ooh.
I'm up.
ALL : Sheldon.
Sheldon.
Sheldon.
Excuse me.
I don't know who you're chanting for, as I am currently the ball.
ALL : The ball.
The ball.
The ball.
Thank you, Jesus!
As my mother would say.
I'm glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.
Yeah, me too.
It's tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you're not ready.
Tell me about it.
I dated this one girl, and I told her that I loved her and she said she wasn't sure.
And she strung me along for almost two years.
It was brutal.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Thanks.
I wish she had just broken up with me right there.
Put me out of my misery.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Would have been kinder.
-Wil, you're up.
-Oh, that's me.
Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?
-What are you talking about?
-He's evil.
He plays evil mind games.
-Did he tell you his grandmother died?
-No.
If he does, don't believe it.
He's not above playing the dead meemaw card.
Yes!
Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton.
But like your time on Star Trek: Next Generation your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived.
-Penny, you're up.
-All right, remember -his meemaw's alive and be the ball.
-Yeah.
I got it.
-Oh, we really need a strike here.
-I know.
-Take your time and concentrate.
-Leonard, stop pressuring me.
-I'm not pressuring you.
-You are.
Just back off.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'll shut up.
I didn't mean shut up.
Fine.
Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.
No.
This isn't fair to you, Leonard.
I'm sorry.
Wait, where are you going?
Penny, come back.
I'll get you ice cream.
-No, let her go.
-Are you insane?
If she leaves, it's over.
Pretty sure it's already over.
Tough luck, Sheldon.
You did this, didn't you?
Do you think I would break up a couple just to win a bowling match?
-No, I suppose not.
-Good.
Keep thinking that.
Wheaton.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Yep.
I'm telling you, the Match.com chicks are much looser than on eHarmony.
Oh.
You know, I gotta call you back.
I won a bet and it's time to collect.
I don't know about you, but I feel empowered.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Oh, damn.
They cancelled my Visa.
Oh, yay, a new MasterCard.
Uh-oh.
-What?
-I was going to get my mail.
Okay.
Are you hoping to get it telepathically?
I think you mean telekinetically.
And no.
Wasn't sure of the protocol now you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.
Ugh.
God, can we please just say "no longer seeing each other"?
Well, we could if it were true.
You live in the same building.
You see each other all the time.
The variable which has changed is the coitus.
Okay, here's the protocol.
You and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.
Good.
I'm glad we're still friends.
-Really?
-Oh, yes.
It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life.
I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain.
Right.
Just to be clear, do I have to stop saying "coitus" with everyone or just you?
Everyone.
Harsh terms, but all right.
-I'll just substitute "intercourse".
-Great.
Or "fornication".
Yeah-- But that has judgmental overtones, so I'll hold that in reserve.
So how you been?
Well, my existence is a continuum so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period.
You're just coitusing with me, aren't you?
-Buzzinga.
-Mm.
-How's Leonard doing?
-He seems all right although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on.
Although now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.
I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it.
I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
-Yep.
-That's the sauce my mother uses.
She likes cooking Italian because, according to her, that's what the Romans made Jesus eat.
Interesting.
I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
I'm hungry now.
Oh, um, okay.
Why don't you give me an hour and come over?
Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
-I don't have hot dogs.
-It's all right.
I do.
Oh.
You're in for what my mother calls a real Italian treat.
-Hey, where you been?
-I was talking with Penny.
What's wrong with you?
You can't hang out with your roommate's ex.
That's totally uncool.
No, it's fine.
I don't care.
I'm over it.
Yeah.
That's why he's been whining about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.
Is he making any progress?
Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.
So would Ben Affleck.
The point is, in a situation like this, you gotta pick sides.
You're either on team Leonard or team Penny.
-Which one picks last?
-What?
Usually, I'm on the team that picks last.
Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair.
Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken.
I hope you're hungry.
Well, of course I'm hungry.
And as I have no plans to eat with any other team I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto.
Mm, mm, mm.
Okay.
Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?
I don't know.
Why?
Just making dinner conversation.
Go team Leonard.
-Oh, God, this is good.
-Let me ask you a question.
Do you believe you're going to go to hell for eating sweet-and-sour pork?
Jews don't have hell.
We have acid reflux.
Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?
Certainly.
It's not like I have to moderate my food intake because I'm planning on eating again very shortly.
Mm, mm, mm.
So you wanna do something tonight?
No, I can't.
I gotta pick up my mom from her water-aerobics class.
Eighteen overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool.
It's like the manatee tank at SeaWorld.
-What about you, Raj?
-Oh, there it is.
Now you don't have a girlfriend you wanna hang out with me again.
I never stopped hanging out with you.
I'm the friend you call when you have no other options.
If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman.
I wish you were Aquaman.
Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old-lady tank.
Excuse me, I'm thirsty so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.
You know what?
I'll just spend the evening alone.
What?
Suddenly, I'm not good enough for you?
I do so love beverages.
Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk.
Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
Since when do you take walks?
I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion but increases serotonin.
If there's one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin.
Bye.
-Hold on.
I'll walk down with you.
-Oh, that's not necessary.
You can go first.
Or we could go together.
I can't think of a reason why not.
-Let's go.
-Hold on.
Nope.
No reason.
I've missed you.
All right, say hello to your mother for me.
Okay.
What?
You said you were going for a walk.
I didn't say outside.
So what, you're gonna walk up and down the stairs?
No, of course not.
That would be odd and suspicious behavior.
-Here, Rumples.
Here, boy.
-Which way are you going?
-Which way are you going?
-I parked my scooter down the block.
I'm going the other way.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, actually, I'm this way.
Do I smell hot dogs?
No.
I mean, I have no idea what you smell.
Well, I definitely smell raw hot dog.
Perhaps you're getting a brain tumor.
All right, have a nice walk.
I shall.
Have a nice scoot.
You might wanna stand back.
I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here.
Oh, hello, doggie.
Nice doggie.
I bet you think you smell hot dogs.
Look, a cat.
Penny.
Penny.
Penny.
Here.
I had to trade the others for my life.
-Hey, Leonard?
-Yeah?
I haven't had sex in a year.
Where are you going with this, Raj?
Don't flatter yourself, dude.
-I wanna go out and meet a woman.
-So go.
I need a wingman.
I don't wanna come off like a lonely loser.
And you think my presence will help with that?
Well, I do.
Next to you, I look like a catch.
-I'm not going out tonight, Raj.
-All right.
Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded Asian pornography?
Very much.
Doesn't have to be Asian.
-Don't worry.
You'll meet a girl.
-No, I won't.
Yes, you will.
And she'll be beautiful and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.
-You really think so?
-I do.
You'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart.
She'll take it and grind it into pathetic little pieces.
We will have sex first, right?
Mm, mm, mm.
That's Italian.
So was Leonard okay with you coming over?
Oh.
Yes.
In fact, he said, "I'm fine.
I don't care".
In no manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.
-Well, good.
-I'm also pleased to report that he's all cried out over you.
He's been crying?
Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn't supposed to mention.
Oh, God.
I feel terrible.
Do you have a stomachache too?
No.
Why, do you?
No.
Why did you ask if I had one too?
Just making polite dinner conversation.
Your turn.
All right.
So, what's new in your life?
Well, my new shoes are not made for running.
Have you been running?
No.
It's just a suspicion I have.
Mm, mm, mm.
-I'm so glad you like it.
-I do.
Leonard never cooks for me.
Well, maybe that's because Leonard can't cook.
You can't cook and you made me this.
Whatever.
Oh, let me get the cheesecake out of the fridge.
Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell.
Look at this.
Do you think she's really doing that or is it Photoshop?
I'm sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big fat Japanese guys.
You don't know that.
Prison changes people.
Hey, where you been?
I told you.
Walking.
For an hour and a half?
I got lost.
How could you get lost?
Your phone has GPS.
Satellites are down.
Solar flares.
-There are no solar flares now.
Yes, there are.
Dude, I'm an astrophysicist.
If there were solar flares, I'd be all up in it.
I'm sorry, I misspoke.
What I meant to say was my battery died.
-What the hell was that about?
-I don't know.
Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?
Aw, we really need to get you a girl.
Leonard.
Leonard.
-Leonard.
-Oh, just come in!
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
What do you want, Sheldon?
Maybe this isn't a good time.
Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin conversation?
Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
What do you want?
You may wanna sit down.
I'm in bed.
Point taken.
You may wanna sit up.
Sheldon!
I've been seeing Penny behind your back.
Okay.
When you say "seeing Penny," what exactly does that mean?
We had dinner last night.
She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it.
Well, little hot dog.
I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog.
A real big dog.
A hell hound.
It's tangential to the primary story.
How about I circle back to it?
Fine.
Why did you have dinner with Penny?
She made spaghetti with little hot dogs.
I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.
Well, then why did you have Chinese food with us?
I didn't wanna upset you.
Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
Is it possible he said, "Bros before ho's"?
Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the ho's.
Sheldon, I don't care if you wanna be friends with Penny.
Oh.
So the turmoil that has been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?
Yes.
Well, then as my meemaw would say looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.
I guess not.
And now, as promised, the tangent.
Sheldon and the Hell Hound.
Or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.
Oh, um, ahem.
-I can come back.
-Don't be silly.
We're neighbors.
We're gonna run into each other.
May as well get used to it.
Yeah.
I guess you're right.
-Used to it yet?
-Nope.
Me neither.
Oh.
Sheldon seemed to think I'd be upset about you hanging out.
But I want you to know it's fine.
Oh, good.
Because his mother called me.
-His mother?
-Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.
I was gonna do that.
Oh, well, then you do it.
I don't wanna do it.
You can do it.
Okay, then you can take him for shoes.
I just took him for shoes.
Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.
Fine.
I'll take him for shoes next Saturday.
No.
A bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.
You're taking him to Disneyland?
Well, he heard me making plans on the phone.
Was I gonna say no?
All right, but let me know if you're gonna stuff him with junk food.
I don't wanna bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
We're going to Disneyland.
He's gonna eat junk food.
All I'm saying is give me a heads-up.
Okay, whatever.
And don't let him go on Space Mountain after he eats.
He'll say he can handle it, but you'll end up with churro puke on your shoes.
All right.
Got it.
Anything else?
Don't let Goofy near him.
He'll have nightmares, and I'll have to deal with it.
-What's the problem with Goofy?
-Wish I knew.
He's fine with Pluto.
Do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?
Well, that's it.
We're officially out of things to talk about.
We're home.
It's 10:00.
Where have you been?
We stayed for the California Adventure water show.
It was pure Disney magic.
-I was gonna see that with him.
-How was I to know that?
It's all right.
I'll see it again with you.
I have food here.
You were gonna call.
-I know, I know.
-I can still eat.
No.
You already threw up once.
Go put on your p.j.'s and brush your teeth.
Okay, but just don't fight.
-We're not fighting.
-Just go.
Aren't you gonna thank Penny for taking you?
Thank you, Penny.
You're welcome, sweetie.
Want a cup of coffee?
Oh, I should probably get going.
-Come on, it's just a cup of coffee.
-Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me too.
What am I smelling?
Sheldon's churro on my shoes.
Such an angel when he's asleep.
Yeah, shame he has to wake up.
I think we can do it.
Smother Sheldon in his sleep?
Wouldn't that be wrong?
No, be friends.
You and me.
Oh, sure.
Absolutely.
Good.
I'm glad.
Here's an idea.
I'm just throwing it out there.
Friends who have sex.
Good night, Leonard.
Kidding.
Just a couple of friends goofing around.
No, Goofy, no.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
-Hold.
-What?
Explain your sneeze.
-I'm sorry?
-Do you have allergies?
-No.
-Too much pepper on your salad?
-I don't put pepper on salads.
-I've heard enough.
Sit over there.
Come on, I don't wanna sit by myself.
That's what Typhoid Mary said.
Clearly, her friends buckled.
Guys, help me.
-Sheldon, come on.
-Yeah, it's just one sneeze.
-You're on your own.
-See you, buddy.
Oh, Leonard, I have something for you.
Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.
When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?
Well, of course.
Pets are banned by the agreement, with the exception of service animals such as Seeing Eye dogs and, one day cybernetically enhanced helper monkeys.
Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
-Sarcasm?
-Yes.
But mixed with genuine concern.
For your information I'll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.
-Cosmological physicist from Princeton?
-Yes.
And until you acquire a surgical mask please address your comments to me through a napkin.
We've been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe.
Now she's under consideration for a position at our university.
Why didn't you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton?
I am a huge fan of hers.
I didn't realize I had to share my connection with things you're a fan of, but, very well.
You enjoy Canadian bacon.
I've been to Toronto.
-Okay, fine.
Where is she gonna sleep?
-My room, of course.
Holy crap.
Holy crap.
-Yeah, I have a two-part question.
-Go ahead.
A, are you kidding me?
And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?
A, I rarely kid.
And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word "buzzinga".
So you're saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
Yes.
Buzzinga.
Leonard?
Thank you.
Why is a renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
She doesn't care for hotels.
And who can blame her?
Windows that don't open, multi-user linens keys shaped like credit cards.
As if one walks around with unassigned slots in one's wallet.
All right, I believe I have time for one more question.
Yes, Raj?
When can I sit with you again?
When I've seen two negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart.
You know the drill.
All right, if you'll excuse me I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.
I can't believe he's friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.
I can't believe they let him into Canada.
Whoa.
You heard the man.
Where's your throat cultures?
-Kidding.
Sit down.
Ha.
-Hey, Sheldon.
-Oh, Penny, excellent.
I have a question about these maxi pads.
Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?
What?
What are you doing with--?
What?
The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?
I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
Oh.
What?
I want her to feel at home.
I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.
Wait.
Wait, hold on.
Back up.
You're having a woman stay with you?
Yes.
Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
No, no, no, I'm not flabbergasted.
I'm puzzled.
Yeah, let's go with puzzled.
A word of warning: My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology so please try to avoid wasting her time with female gibber-gabber.
Female gibber-gabber?
Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks gossip about your friends, Brad and Angelina.
No, they're not my friends.
Not surprised, considering how you talk about them behind their backs.
She's here.
She's here.
How do I look?
Do I look smart?
Oh, good grief.
This isn't about you.
Coming.
Now, listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century.
So pay attention.
Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.
Well, I have so many things to tell your biographer.
Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness.
I completely forgot your address.
But then, I remembered that I'd written it on my hand.
Lucky I didn't confuse it with what I'd written on my other hand which are the coordinates for a neutron star.
Because if I tried to go there, I'd be crushed by hypergravity.
-Anyway, hello.
-Hello.
-Nice to finally meet you in person.
-I would imagine it is.
This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
Hi-lo.
Oops.
I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle.
It came out "hi-lo".
Duh.
It's nice to meet you.
I've read both your books and your papers.
I'm Leonard.
I live here.
You're brilliant.
I apologize.
He's only an experimental physicist.
No need to apologize.
Some of my best friends are experimental physicists.
Well, not my best friends.
But I know them.
My best friend is a molecular chemist named Wendy.
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.
-Hi-lo.
Heh, heh.
Hungry?
Can I offer you anything?
If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me.
Elizabeth, can I get you something?
Perhaps a feminine-hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?
Interesting choices.
Based on my current needs, I guess I'd pick the yogurt.
Excellent.
If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles.
Look, it's you.
Thank you so much for opening up your home to me.
Well, who wants to stay in a hotel?
Windows that don't open, those crazy card-shaped keys.
I'm so glad you understand.
No, he doesn't understand.
-I understand.
-I understand too.
You're just misappropriating my understanding.
I think any university would want you.
Except any university that already had you because they would've already wanted you before they, you know, got you.
From the mind that brought you hi-lo.
Let me show you to your room.
All right, I guess I am tired.
-Good night, Leonard.
-Sleep night.
I mean, obviously, good night.
I started to say sleep tight.
Then I changed my mind in the middle.
I swear to God, I'm smart.
Get it together, man.
All right, let me show you some of the features of the room.
First, windows.
Conventional.
Open, closed.
Open, closed.
Halfway open, or halfway closed depending on your philosophical bent.
Over here is my comic-book collection.
Feel free to browse.
There's a box of disposable reading gloves on the nightstand.
Good to know.
In here, you'll find emergency provisions.
An eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow season two of Star Trek: The Original Series on a high-density flash drive.
What if there's a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?
Then there's really no reason to live, is there?
Can I ask you a question about your roommate?
He's an odd duck, isn't he?
What's his relationship status?
Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall.
It ended as inexplicably as it began.
They had very little in common except for carnal activity.
That's why I acquired these noise-canceling headphones.
If you decide to use them, please clean the earpieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you'll find in the bathroom.
They're in the drawer labeled "Wet Wipes".
-Okay.
-Good.
I'll leave you to your nighttime ablutions.
I've e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule.
You'll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet.
On the back of the emergency-escape-route diagram.
How thoughtful.
-Sleep well, my friend.
-You too.
Let me just get one thing.
It's my backup emergency supply kit.
The living-room escape route doesn't pass through here.
Now, good night.
And if there's an apocalypse, good luck.
Yes?
-I saw your light on.
-Is everything all right?
Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.
Me neither.
Look what I'm reading.
It's you.
-I thought you already read it.
-I did.
But it's been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.
Aw, you're smart.
Oh, good.
I wasn't sure it was coming across.
What chapter are you on?
Uh, six.
Ah.
The extragalactic distance ladder.
-Want to know a little secret?
-Sure.
I wrote the section on the Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.
Really?
Sure doesn't read that way.
Here, let me show you.
When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars we start to see a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble's constant.
Wow.
You really make science come alive.
Vocal test.
Morning vocal test.
Second vocal test.
Second morning vocal test.
-Morning, Sheldon.
-Morning.
-Morning, Sheldon.
-Morning.
-I trust you had a pleasant night?
-More than pleasant.
Excuse me.
I'm going to relieve myself.
-How do you take your coffee?
-Black.
Okeydoke.
Pee for Houston.
Pee for Austin.
Pee for the state my heart got lost in.
And shake twice for Texas.
Something his mother taught him.
All right.
Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours.
The seat is down and has been sanitized for your protection.
That's very thoughtful, but I think I'll finish my coffee first.
Ah, so the yogurt didn't work.
I'll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.
Oh, good, you're up.
My car won't start.
I need a ride to work.
Did you ignore your check-engine light?
No, Mr. Smarty-pants.
I ignored the fill-gas-tank light.
Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.
Oh, uh, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug.
-Hello?
-Hi.
Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology.
Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn't understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine.
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.
-Are you enjoying your stay?
-Yes, very much.
Good.
Wonderful.
Meaningless pleasantries accomplished.
Elizabeth, Leonard's bathroom time is coming up and, believe me, you do not want to follow him.
Excuse me.
Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work.
You and Sheldon and Sheldon's friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met.
It'll be fun.
Like a clown car.
Heh, heh.
-Hang on.
-Hm, yeah?
What?
Huh?
We just broke up.
You and me?
Yeah, we did.
Not too long ago.
How are you doing with it?
Not as good as you, apparently.
I don't follow.
You know, it's none of my business.
You wanna sleep with Sheldon's buddy right after we broke up, go for it.
-Well, now--  Excuse me.
I'm uncomfortable with you recommending Leonard pursue intercourse with Dr. Plimpton.
Who, I assure you, has better things to do.
I'm not recommending it.
I'm saying it already happened.
Oh, that's preposterous.
Tell her, Leonard.
Well.
No.
Oh, come on.
It wasn't my fault.
The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
I'm just gonna take the bus to work.
-Penny, I can still drive you.
-No, no, it's okay.
You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.
I must say, I'm shocked by this betrayal.
I didn't betray Penny.
Not Penny, me.
How am I betraying you?
Elizabeth's my friend, and you're playing with her.
Yeah, I guess I did.
What the hell are you doing?
Relax, it's Nyquil.
-You still have a cold?
-Maybe, but I don't care.
That's the great thing about Nyquil, it's like 10 percent booze.
I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing so-you-can-talk-to-girls medicine.
Are you having trouble sleeping?
Because, boy, I was up all night.
Did you get a cold too?
No, I was awake all night.
If you want, I can give you some of my mom's sleeping pills.
-She won't notice they're missing?
-She doesn't know she takes them.
No, that's okay.
It was something else keeping me up last night.
And again this morning.
And I didn't mind.
I was up last night.
I was up this morning.
I didn't mind.
Those are your clues.
Ooh, ooh, did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?
-No.
-Were you making another Lego movie?
-No.
-Because let me tell you: It's not enough to make the Legos move.
They also have to capture your heart.
Okay, I'll give you one more clue.
It involved another person.
Did you get a Japanese love pillow?
How is a Japanese love pillow another person?
It is if you love her and give her a name.
Dr. Plimpton, I'd like you to meet my colleagues.
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.
-And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
-Hi.
-I'm a big fan of your work.
-Thank you.
And, of course, you've already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.
-Hey, you.
-Hey, you.
Boy, I'm kind of tuckered out.
How are you feeling, Elizabeth?
You know what?
I am a little tired.
Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?
Sure.
Black, right?
Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet.
Coming right up.
What?
What do you mean, "what"?
It's "Halo" night.
I can't.
I'm too sick.
Go away.
That's why we moved "Halo" night here.
I brought my mom's chicken soup.
I'm not hungry.
Don't send him away.
Let him in.
-Who is that?
-I bought a parrot.
Yeah, right.
-Dr. Plimpton?
-Hi.
-Howard, right?
-Uh, yeah.
Can I ask you a question, Howard?
Do you like role-playing games?
Yeah, sure.
Heh.
In fact, I'm a dungeon master.
Not tonight.
Tonight, you are a deliveryman.
You've brought soup but, uh-oh, Raj and I don't have enough money to pay you.
So we'll have to come to some other kind of arrangement.
Beg pardon?
You figure out the details.
I'm gonna change into something I don't mind getting ripped off my milky flesh.
What the frak?
Go away.
She wants New Delhi, not kosher deli.
Besides, you have a girlfriend.
We broke up weeks ago.
-Why didn't you say anything?
-I was waiting for the right time.
This is the right time.
Hey, who's ready for "Halo"?
Oh, this is like a nightmare.
Get lost.
The numbers are shaky enough as it is.
I don't understand.
Oh, good.
Leonard's here.
Good?
Elizabeth?
What's going on?
What's going on is you and Howard are my moving men.
And Raj is my new landlord.
And I don't have enough money to pay any of you.
Is she suggesting what I think she's suggesting?
Yup.
Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.
Okay, show of hands.
Who's up for this?
We'll all be naked in front of each other.
I'm out.
Everybody ready?
Follow my lead.
Almost.
We're going to go out into the hallway and make a dramatic entrance.
Oh, good.
It's so much better when everyone commits.
Run, run, run.
Don't look back.
I thought we had something special.
So you say you can't pay your rent?
-Oh, Leonard?
-Hey.
I found these in the dryer.
I'm assuming they belong to Sheldon.
Thanks.
It's really hard to find these in his size.
So listen.
I've been meaning to talk to you about the other morning.
You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?
Yeah, I wanted to explain.
No.
You don't owe me an explanation.
-I don't?
-No, you don't.
So you're not judging me?
Oh, I'm judging you nine ways to Sunday but you don't owe me an explanation.
Nevertheless, I'd like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did.
I'm listening.
She let me.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Okay, Baby-Doll Pink let's see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad's feet.
It's two degrees, Sheldon.
I just wanna turn up the thermostat two degrees.
Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
Yes, if we were lived in a tea kettle.
This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
Screw the roommate agreement.
No, you don't screw the roommate agreement the roommate agreement screws you.
You know what, go to hell and set their thermostat.
I don't have to go to hell.
At 73 degrees, I'm there already.
Who is it?
Leonard.
-Hang on.
Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
You can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.
You heard that, huh?
Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.
So you agree he's nuts.
Not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.
Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.
Oh, I do not believe that.
You are so naive.
Just like I was seven years ago.
I'd just started at the university.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Sheldon Cooper's apartment.
-Oh.
I bet you're here to check out the room.
-Yeah.
Run away, dude.
-What?
-Run fast, run far.
That should've been my first clue.
So Sheldon's last roommate tried to warn you off?
For all I knew, he was the crazy one.
He had this really deranged look.
Well, yeah, he'd been living with Sheldon.
Sure, it makes sense now.
Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.
Yeah?
Dr. Cooper?
No, you want the crazy guy across the hall.
In retrospect, that was clue number two.
-Yes?
-I'm Leonard Hofstadter.
-I called about the apartment.
You said-- -I know what I said.
I know what you said.
I know what my mother said on March 5th, 1992.
What is the sixth noble gas?
-What?
-You said you're a scientist.
-What is the sixth noble gas?
-Uh, Radon?
Are you asking me or telling me?
Telling you?
Telling you.
All right.
Next question.
Kirk or Picard?
Oh, uh-- Well, that's tricky.
Um-- Well, original series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.
Correct.
You've passed the first barrier to roommatehood.
You may enter.
Oh, this is pretty nice.
-The bedrooms are back there?
-That depends.
I don't understand.
Their existence is conditional?
No.
But your ability to perceive their existence is conditional -There's three?
-Each more daunting than the last.
-Have a seat.
-Okay.
No, that's where I sit.
What's the difference?
This seat is ideally located in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer.
It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation.
As a result I've placed it in a state of eternal dibs.
Can you do that?
That's Latin for "My chair my rules".
Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics.
Yeah, experimental physics.
Hmm.
-What is that?
-Doesn't concern you.
You'll be going to the university every day?
-Yes.
-Do you have a vehicle?
-A car.
-And you'd be willing to drive me?
-Well, can't you drive?
-I can.
I choose not to.
Okay, I suppose I could drive you.
-Well, what's a point in my favor, right?
-Why don't you let me do this?
Come on, I just asked.
Last question.
In a post-apocalyptic world which task would you assign the highest priority?
Locating a sustainable food source, reestablishing a functioning government procreation or preserving the knowledge of mankind?
Uh, I'm gonna go with preserving the knowledge.
That's correct.
FYI, I would've accepted any answer other than procreating.
Come, I'll show you the rest of the apartment.
Good.
I passed the barriers.
The second barrier.
Don't get cocky.
This is the bathroom.
Are you fairly regular?
-Uh-- I guess.
-This isn't going to work if you're guessing.
When do you evacuate your bowels?
When I have to.
When you have to?
I'm sorry, I don't rent to hippies.
I'm sorry, in the morning.
Around 8.
I can't give you 8.
I can give you 7:30.
Fine, I'll take it.
Third barrier passed.
You have won the right to see your room.
Pizah.
-Is this it?
-No, this is my room.
People don't go in my room.
So where do you sleep?
Heh.
I don't understand.
If people don't go in there, and you're people and.
You are people, aren't you?
Making a joke.
Do you do this often?
On occasion.
Your room.
You may wanna repaint.
And after all that you just moved in?
I didn't just move in.
First we had to iron out a few details.
"Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon's brilliant new series, Firefly".
Does that really need to be in the agreement?
Might as well settle it now, it's gonna be on for years.
Initial here.
All right, that's television and movies.
"Section nine: Miscellany.
The apartment's flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure".
We have a flag?
Never fly it upside down.
Unless the apartment's in distress.
Fine, next.
"If either of us ever invents time travel we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds".
Okay.
Well, that's disappointing.
Why on earth did you agree to all that?
It was the best apartment I'd seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you pass the first three barriers, you kind of wanna take it all the way.
Well, I'm sorry, Leonard.
It's very hard to feel sympathy for you.
Okay.
Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over.
Leonard?
Shh.
Just pretend we're not here.
Leonard?
I'm sure he'll go away.
I'm just gonna keep knocking till you answer.
Leonard?
Leonard?
Leonard?
What do you want?
I didn't say come in.
You asked what I want.
I wanted to come in.
I'm here because you violated our roommate agreement.
Specifically, section eight visitor's subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus.
"Roommates shall give each other I didn't even know her 12 hours ago.
That's it, I'm out of here.
Joyce, come on.
Twelve hours?
Oh, my God.
-Do I get some sympathy now?
-Little bit.
Let me get this straight.
You move in with this guy, makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement.
Then he walks into your bedroom while you're doing Joyce Kim and you still stay?
Actually, I couldn't get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.
Why not?
Well, I was doing some government research at the time.
You know, military rocket fuels.
Kind of secret.
-What does that have to do with Joyce?
-As it turns out she was a North Korean spy.
Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important.
Which I'm not saying I would have.
So you stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?
That's part of it.
The other part is what happened with the elevator.
I've been wondering.
You said it was working when you moved in.
It was.
But one night Sheldon came home from work.
What is going on here?
Hey, this is Howard and Raj.
They work at the university too.
-Hey.
-Hey.
I'll get to you later.
What are you sitting on?
I can't speak for these guys, but I'm sitting on my tushy.
Heh, heh.
-It's a joke.
-Not a good idea.
-"Tushy" is "buttocks," right?
-Right.
Heh.
Hilarious.
Heh, heh.
Explain the couch.
There were people on the first floor who were moving out and sold it for $100.
-Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.
-What's wrong with the furniture we have?
They are lawn chairs.
There was no place for company.
Did it occur to you that was by design?
According to the roommate agreement, I'm entitled to allocate 50 percent of the cubic footage of common areas.
But you didn't notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach.
I did notify you.
Oh, you did, did you?
Drat.
Hoisted by my own spam filter.
-What am I doing in your spam?
-I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano entitled "This is funny".
Oh, yeah.
I saw that.
That was hilarious.
Heh-heh-heh.
-What's this have to do with the elevator?
-I'm getting to it.
I assure you, you'll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs.
Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?
Yes.
You just assume you're always right?
It's not an assumption.
-Change seats with me.
-Why?
I don't like this spot.
I have to keep turning my head.
Fine.
It's time for Babylon 5.
We don't watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.
-Why not?
-Because no one likes Babylon 5.
-I like it.
-Me too.
-So do I. -There you go, three against one.
They don't get a vote.
It's one against one.
And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me.
-But I said no to that.
-And I said yes.
And I settle all ties.
-Change seats with me.
-Why?
There's a draft on my neck over here.
So I get the draft?
You're protected by your turtleneck.
Fine.
And it's a dickey.
Hmm.
I'm still not comfortable.
Of course, there's too many people here.
We can fix that.
Let's leave.
Yeah, we can go over to my place.
Wait, let me get my jacket.
-You're not going with us.
-Why not?
You're the guy we're trying to get away from.
Oh.
In that case, I don't need my jacket.
And for the record, the correct syntax is: "I'm the guy from whom you're trying to get away".
Oh, yes.
This is definitely gonna be my spot.
Okay.
How do you know he said that?
You left the room.
Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man-feet or not?
Fine.
Go ahead.
Howard, are you having a playdate?
!
I don't have playdates!
I have colleagues!
Do their parents know they're here?
!
No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they'll hear you!
That your dad?
She grows any more hair on her face, yes.
Oh, man.
Is that a two-stage rocket?
Three.
I designed the engine myself.
Cool.
Can it break Mach 1?
Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government's been working on.
Oh, this just might be your lucky day.
Howard, what happened to the Oreos I left on the counter?
!
I haven't seen your Oreos!
Just take your bath without them!
So why was it his lucky day?
It turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.
What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
Joyce Kim was curious about what I did for a living and I was gonna kind of show it to her.
The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment.
-Are we ever gonna get to the elevator?
-We're close.
We're at the apartment.
The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over -Cool.
-Nice.
Won't work.
Excuse me, but I've been working on this a long time.
Trust me, it'll work.
You don't see your mistake, do you?
There's no mistake.
This is for a full scale rocket, not a model.
-Well, I've adjusted the formula.
-Not correctly.
Okay, I've had it with you.
You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics.
And when it comes to applied physics-- Uh-oh.
-What's happening?
-A bad thing.
A very bad thing.
Get the door.
Get the door.
Get the door.
Get the door.
-You're waiting for the elevator?
-Oh, right.
-Wait.
It's here.
-Ah!
Give me that.
What'd you do that for?
I had plenty of time.
You're welcome.
Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn't rat me out to the landlord.
Or the police.
Or Homeland Security.
So you're the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?
So I did something stupid.
I'm sure you did stupid things.
What were you doing seven years ago?
Excuse me, I was in high school.
Studying, keeping my nose clean doing volunteer work for the community.
Not pregnant.
Yes!
Ha, ha!
Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favorite Linux-based operating system.
-Hey.
-Hello.
Why do I smell methacrylate?
Oh, clear nail polish.
I had a mani-pedi.
Men can get those.
Anyway, I may owe you an apology.
There's doubt?
I did agree to the thermostat setting and I shouldn't have tried to change it.
That's not an apology.
That's simply an acknowledgment that I was right.
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-There you go.
So we're good?
-Good what?
-Never mind.
-Okay if I watch some TV?
-Go ahead.
MAN : Up next: Babylon 5.
You're not even watching.
I can hear it.
Oh, so the dialogue offends you?
I would hardly call that dialogue.
You are insane, you know that?
Don't make me turn that flag upside down because you know I'll do it.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Okay, we've got power to the laser.
I should've brought an umbrella.
-What for?
It's not gonna rain.
-I know.
But with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.
That's a buzzinga, right?
One of my best, don't you think?
Howard, double-check the equatorial mount on the laser.
-We need it locked on the Sea of Tranquility.
-You got it.
Raj, no.
Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women so we don't have to peep through windows.
It's not like that.
I'm watching someone's TV.
The Good Wife is on.
I tell you, this is my new Grey's Anatomy.
Leonard, what is that?
What is that?
Relax, it's just a dirty sock.
How on earth can you say "dirty sock" and "relax" in the same sentence?
Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty, discarded socks.
Not my world.
You know who'd really dig seeing this experiment?
Penny.
I wasn't aware that lunar ranging was her thing.
Although I suppose the retroreflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.
Ask her to come up.
I don't know.
It's still weird since, you know.
-She dumped you?
-She didn't dump me.
We were just in different places in the relationship.
I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
Well, it's very simple.
Leonard was living in a town called Please Don't Leave Me while Penny had just moved to the island of Bye-bye.
Screw you, guys.
I'm gonna go see if she's home.
If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to point this at the moon now.
Wait a second.
The good wife is crying.
Something's very wrong.
Oh, hi.
What's going on?
We're up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
I'm sorry, what?
It's cool.
We've got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything.
-I thought you might wanna see it.
-That makes no sense.
How can you bounce stuff off the moon?
There's no gravity.
Oh, Leonard, this is Zack.
Zack, Leonard.
-Hey.
-Sorry, I didn't know you were busy.
-Maybe another time.
-Yeah.
Maybe.
-Hey, I wanna see this laser thing.
-Oh, what about the party?
It's a surprise party, doesn't matter when we get there.
Right.
Okay, well, yeah, come on up.
So how'd you guys meet?
My company designs the menus for The Cheesecake Factory.
Your company?
My dad, but me and my sister are VPs.
So menus.
It sounds easy, but there's a lot of science that goes into designing them.
Happy now?
I'm moving the dirty sock.
Thank you.
Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.
-Hey, guys.
This is my friend Zack.
Hey.
-Hello.
-Whoa, is that the laser?
It's bitchen.
Yes.
In 1917 when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung his fondest hope was that the resultant device be "bitchen".
Well, mission accomplished.
Let me explain what we're doing here.
In 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the moon.
We're gonna shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.
Oh, that's very cool.
One question: How can you be sure it won't blow up?
-The laser?
-The moon.
See, now this is a man for Penny.
-That's a great question, Zack.
-No, it's not.
-Sheldon, play nice.
-It's not a great question.
How could somebody possibly think we're going to blow up the moon?
That's a great question.
Don't worry about the moon.
We set our laser to stun.
Smart.
We'll see the beam when it leaves.
It won't be strong enough when it comes back -to be seen by the naked eye.
-Naked.
Heh, heh, heh.
Right, funny.
So that device there will measure the photons that return and show it to us on this computer.
Raj, get them some glasses.
Cool, it's gonna be in 3-D?
Preparing to fire laser at the moon.
Make it so.
There it is.
There's the spike.
Two-point-five seconds for the light to return.
That's the moon.
We hit the moon.
That's your big experiment?
All that for a line on the screen?
Yeah, but think about what this represents.
The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon put there by a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.
What species is that?
I was wrong.
Penny can do better.
-Okay, guys, thank you.
It's been fun.
-Yeah, thanks.
-Should we invite them to the party?
-No, just keep walking.
He's must be very skilled at coitus.
I'm telling you, dude the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.
-Horse.
-What?
The phrase is "get back on the horse".
Not whores.
That's disgusting, dude.
No, it's not.
Never mind.
He is right, though.
If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.
No, thanks.
You sure?
They say they can find a match for anybody.
-Have they found a match for you?
-Tons.
I've had, like, eight dates in the last month.
Twelve, if you count the ones who showed up and left.
-I can't bring the nitrogen tank down.
-Why not?
All right, let me restate that.
It's very heavy and I don't want to.
-I'll help you.
-Thank you.
Lift with your knees, not your back.
Good night.
You know what would be fun?
-Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
-Yeah, right.
No, think about it.
We make it an experiment.
Like when Frankenstein's monster was lonely and he found a wife.
He didn't find a wife.
They built him a wife out of dead body parts.
Okay, we'll call that plan B.  Coming.
Damn you, you rat bastard.
Are you drunk?
Zack was a perfectly nice guy and then you ruined him.
How did I ruin him?
Because in the olden days, I never would've known he was so stupid.
-Come on, he wasn't that stupid.
-Yes, he was.
He thought you were gonna blow up the moon.
Okay, yeah, he's stupid.
Heh, heh.
He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word "appeteasers".
How is that my fault?
You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots.
Now, come with me.
-Where are we going?
-We're gonna have sex.
Why?
I mean, okay.
What's going on?
Put on your noise-canceling headphones, because it's gonna get loud.
Ugh.
Not this again.
In what universe is this "low-pulp"?
Good morning, Penny.
Do you have eyes in the back of your head?
When one gets beaten up every other day in school one, of necessity, develops a keen sense of hearing.
Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as "one".
I'm making English muffins.
Would you like an English muffin?
Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.
FYI, my noise-canceling headphones proved ineffective last night.
-Yeah, sorry about that.
-As a native Texan, I must say I've never heard the phrase "yeehaw" used in quite that context.
Oh, God.
"Oh, God".
That I've heard on multiple occasions.
In what universe is that "lightly toasted"?
This has to be the worst day of my life.
Good morning, Leonard.
How many times have I asked you not to do that?
Counting this instance?
Three hundred seventeen.
-Where's Penny?
-She returned to her apartment.
I presume to shower and vomit.
Not necessarily in that order.
Wonder why she didn't say goodbye.
Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behavior?
I know.
I thought as an outsider you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.
Well, I have no difficulty believing you are not butter.
-Oh, hey.
-Oh, hi.
-I gotta run.
Early shift.
-Okay, I'll walk down with you.
So last night was fun, huh?
Yeah, it must've been.
I just threw up in my closet.
Bummer.
I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.
Oh, yeah, tonight's not great for me.
Doesn't have to be tonight.
I'm free pretty much always.
Leonard, last night was a mistake.
When you say "mistake," do you mean a fortunate mistake like the discovery of penicillin?
Look, I'm sorry.
I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack.
Can we just forget it ever happened?
No, it's pretty well imprinted on my brain.
Especially the whole rodeo thing.
Oh, God.
So that's it?
Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?
Look, I said I'm sorry.
Can't you please let it go?
How am I supposed to let it go?
You used me for sex.
Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.
Good morning, Leonard.
Or should I say "yeehaw"?
-Holy crap.
-What?
We finally have proof -that aliens walk among us.
-Excuse me?
The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.
You're kidding.
An actual woman?
Yeah, look.
Breasts and everything.
Trust me, breasts doesn't necessarily mean "woman".
-Since when?
-I'll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime.
Leonard, you gotta see this.
We found a match for Sheldon.
Great.
Maybe she can have sex with him and walk out on him the next morning without so much as a "How do you do"?
-Know what he's talking about?
-No.
Ask him.
-Leonard, what?
-I don't wanna talk about it.
That was a lousy suggestion.
Whatever.
Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match.
"Greetings, fellow life-form".
If she can do it, I can do it.
If she can do it, I can do it.
If she can do it, I can do it.
I can't do it.
-Hello?
-Oh, hi.
Hey.
Hi, Leslie.
Leonard, what're you doing here?
I know.
It's been a while.
Yeah, 18 months.
Right.
Right.
So how you doing?
-Fine.
You?
-Not bad.
You remember when we used to have sex and you said it didn't mean anything, it was just for fun?
Yeah.
Do you wanna do that again?
What happened?
Blondie dumped you?
She didn't dump me.
We were just in different places in the relationship.
Right.
Anyway, apparently, it's okay to go back to people you're no longer seeing -and have recreational sex with them.
-Uh-huh.
So, what do you say?
Let me think about it.
She's not coming back.
-Uh-oh.
She wants to meet us.
-Not us.
Him.
Yes, but "him" doesn't even know about "her".
Well, "him" about to find out about "her".
Really?
Us gonna tell him?
Who's going to tell whom about what?
Sheldon.
Hey.
Hi.
Your surprise confuses me.
I live here.
Right.
So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?
-Be more specific.
-Four-thirty.
That's not afternoon.
That's preevning.
-What?
-It's a time of day I invented.
It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening: preevning.
Fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
Right, okay.
What are you doing tomorrow preevning?
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.
Saturday night is laundry night.
So I'll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.
Okay, what if I were to tell you tomorrow at 4:30, you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?
I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.
But it's true.
We put all your vital information into this dating site answered all questions like you would and they found a match for you.
-Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.
-Please.
Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.
That's the answer we gave to the question.
"What is your attitude towards online dating"?
Well, Howard wanted to write "mumbo jumbo," but I said no.
Our Sheldon would say "hokum".
Come on, where's your scientific curiosity?
Most of it is being applied to unraveling secrets of universe while the rest of it is wondering why I'm having this conversation with you.
Okay, how about this?
Even Spock had a date once every seven years.
He didn't date.
It was pon farr.
His blood boiled with mating lust.
Why don't you start with a cup of coffee and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.
-I don't drink coffee.
-All right, you can have a hot chocolate.
As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot.
For the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.
-Why?
-What's life without whimsy?
Okay, I'm out.
Sheldon I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment.
Unless you're willing to come with us to meet this girl it will remain there forever.
You're bluffing.
Are you willing to risk it?
Curse you.
Thirty feet.
Oh.
Hey, Leonard.
I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy and then you ruined me.
Are you drunk?
Come on.
We're gonna have sex and it's not gonna mean a thing.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm really starting to think there's a double standard here.
In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise how would you prefer I do it?
The standard "I told you so"?
With a classic "neener-neener"?
Or just my normal look of haughty derision?
-You don't know we're wrong yet.
-Haughty derision it is.
Excuse me.
I'm Amy Farrah Fowler.
You're Sheldon Cooper.
Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler.
I'm sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely.
Additionally, I'm being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.
If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it.
If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery.
I'm here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.
Interesting.
My mother and I have the same agreement about church.
I don't object to the concept of a deity, but I'm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.
Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.
Noted.
Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.
May I buy you a beverage?
Tepid water, please.
Good God, what have we done?
