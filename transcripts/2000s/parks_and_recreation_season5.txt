{START OF EPISODE 1}
Washington, D.C. Take a deep breath, Andy.
I mean, you can practically smell the bills becoming laws.
Yeah.
You can taste the sweet sugar of bureaucracy at work.
That building looks like a boob.
- Yeah, well, it's not.
- Oh, yeah, I know.
- It's the White House.
- No.
It's the Capitol.
My amazing lover, Ben Wyatt, is here working on a congressional campaign.
And he took April with him as his intern.
I'm here to visit, but I am also here to work, because I have a very important meeting where I am going to try to get federal funding so we can clean up the Pawnee river.
It's a bit of a fixer-upper.
Romantic reunions, government meetings, self-guided museum tours-- I mean, am I living the dream?
I don't know.
Did I also just walk past a food truck and buy myself a waffle sundae?
Yes.
Now take out your guidebook.
Oh, I didn't bring a guidebook.
- Oh, I brought you one.
- You did?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Now throw it away, 'cause Leslie Knope is your guidebook.
I didn't-- I didn't mean literally.
There were some notes in it.
Okay, grab the book, and let's hit the National Mall.
There's a mall?
That's awesome.
I need to get some flip-flops.
Why are we having a conference-room meeting?
Leslie's gone.
Ron has taken initiative, and he is leading the meeting.
He's not joking.
I wanted to let you all know that I will be throwing the annual Parks Department employee-appreciation barbecue.
You're going to throw the Leslie Knope Employment Enjoyment Summerslam Grill Jam Fun-splosion?
That's right.
You are gonna oversee the Popsicle-eating contest, the slip'n slide-a-thon, the watermelon carving, the gazpacho-off, and star in a one-woman show about parks rules and regulations?
"Parks and Dolls".
I got your park right here, its name is Ramsett Park.
All: and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
I am not doing any of that, which is the point.
Every summer Leslie throws a barbecue to thank the Parks and Maintenance staff.
It's horrifying.
Barbecues should be about one thing-- good, shared meat.
There will be no froofy desserts.
There will be no giant-soap-bubble guns.
There will be no adult men in costumes.
And most of all, there will be no ing vegetables.
Well, Ron, can we at least have corn on the cob?
No.
"In this temple, "As in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever".
Andy, what are you doing?
Have you ever seen any of the National Treasure movies?
Everything in this city is a clue.
Nothing in that movie is accurate.
Aha!
A clue!
Check it out.
I think that's just gum.
How do I know this isn't a treasure map just waiting to be unfurled?
- Because it's gum.
- That's gum.
Yeah.
So you can see that the color changes about 1/3 of the way up, and it's when construction was actually halted on the monu-- Leslie, this is a really cool penis, but Ben and April are meeting us at the Smithsonian in 10 minutes.
Let's talk on the way.
Which nation?
I offered Ron a job last month, and he turned me down.
And it literally broke my heart.
But now I see that this is truly where he belongs.
Way to be, Ron!
You're really getting it done, man!
He can't hear me.
Okay, let's begin the barbecue.
Oh, hey, little guy.
What are you doing?
Oh, no.
Everyone, meet your meat.
All: No!
Why are you doing this to us?
Well, in my opinion, not enough people have looked their dinner in the eyes and considered the circle of life.
This is your dinner.
His name is Tom.
Burn.
Seriously?
I understand that it's hilarious, but that is his given, Christian name.
Tom is very smart and incredibly loyal.
He's basically a dog.
A dog we're going to cook, chew, and swallow.
Dude, there's kids around here.
Good point.
Which one of you youngsters wants to help me drain the blood from this animal?
If you do a good job, I'll give you the bladder.
You can blow it up for a fun play ball.
Hey, Ron.
You're not going to slaughter that pig here, are you?
Not to worry.
I have a permit.
This just says, "I can do what I want".
I am the director of the Parks Department, and this is a park.
It's not a Parks thing.
It's against, like, three laws and a dozen health codes.
Fine.
Barbecue is postponed until I can go pick up some meat from the Food 'n' Stuff.
Let's go, Tom.
No, pig Tom.
So I want to see the history of the girl scouts and then Lincoln's pocket watch and the First Ladies exhibit and everything-- I want to see everything.
Andy, get down from there.
Hey, Leslie.
Is this the train from Back to the Future III?
- Get down from there.
- I think it is.
Hey, buddy.
Come on down from there for me, please.
Sir, you protect our nation's history, and you're a hero.
Yeah, a hero with something to hide, like probably a treasure map.
Oh, hey.
It's so good to see you.
It's so great to see you too.
Yeah.
Yikes.
Okay, uh, guys, let's motor.
Guys.
Guys.
Let's go get some astronaut ice cream or something.
We were thinking about maybe just-- uh, we-- maybe we were gonna go back to-- We're gonna have sex.
Okay.
You look great, April.
Sorry, hon.
I actually have to go too.
Oh, really?
I thought maybe we could sightsee together.
I know.
I have, like, 1,000 meetings.
But I just wanted to come wish you luck before your presentation.
Oh, but you know what you should see while you're here is George Washington's fare-- Farewell address candle stand.
That was the first thing I was going to see.
God, I love you so much.
Come to my office as soon as you're done, okay?
Okay.
And it was nice to see you again.
Are you talking to my butt?
-  Yes.
- Okay.
Where is Swanson?
Man, I'm hungry.
My legs are tired.
It feels like I just exercised.
Just sit on the ground.
No, Jerry.
It's dirty, and I'm wearing my summer linens.
God, you're such a baby.
Look, I brought a picnic blanket from your house.
That's not a picnic blanket.
That's a Merino wool throw for my Eames chair!
Uh-oh.
Do I sense trouble in the Haverford-Perkins household?
No such luck, Donna.
Ann and Tom, aka Haverkins, are stronger than ever.
Everyone said it wouldn't last.
And it didn't.
Shocking that our drunken plan to move in together wasn't a success.
- Let's move in together.
- Totally.
No take-backs when we sober up, though, partner.
No take-backs, partner.
After the first day, we realized we had made a huge mistake.
Huge.
However, everyone was being so smug about it, saying there's no way it would last, so we're pretending to still be together.
That way, no one gets the satisfaction of being right, even though they are, but still.
More importantly, I bet Donna $1,000 that we'd be together for another month.
I can't stress this enough.
If she finds out that we broke up, I'll go bankrupt.
Oh, my God.
Food.
Food.
Yes, I am returned.
No.
Not so fast, Shirley.
I just have to thaw the meat, season it, and grill it up.
So it's going to be a few hours.
No, Ron.
My tummy's rumbling.
It's scary.
Tommy's got the tum-rums.
Ron, Chris Traeger feelings update-- I'm now feeling that your guests are getting a little antsy.
Fine.
I'll skip a few steps and speed things up.
There you go.
Is there at least something to drink?
There's beer in the cooler.
What about for the children?
You can get water from that water fountain and use it to water down the beer.
Why don't you just give the kids water?
I suppose you could do that.
Now, would everyone please back off and just let me cook in peace?
These people are soft.
They're grill virgins.
But by the time this day is over, they'll have been taken by the grill and delicately and tenderly shown the ways of flavorful meat love.
Mmm The first time is so beautiful.
Ben and I are a power couple, like the Roosevelts or the Clintons.
I've got a big meeting here.
Ben is off running a congressional campaign.
I mean, the only way we could be more awesome is if we had our own signature dance move.
Oh, wait.
We do.
Three, four.
I'm Leslie Knope.
I have a 3:00 with Mr. Jepson.
What's this in reference to?
I'm here to present my application for the Federal Riverbed Preservation Grant.
Oh.
Most people just mail their applications in.
I'm not most people.
Mr. Jepson actually had to step out for the day.
You can just add your proposal to that pile there.
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
I was told I would have a face-to-face meeting with him so I could make my case for my town.
Does he have office hours?
He's unavailable for the rest of the week.
But you can just add the proposal.
- He'll get to it.
- Oh Okay.
It's kind of a special application.
Uh, you know, there's a-a CD inside that, uh, plays the sound of a babbling river, and I was going to play that while I gave my presentation.
I was also going to show a DVD that had some images of frolicking river otters.
You know what?
I-I'll make sure he reads it.
What city is it for?
Pawnee.
Is that Pawnee, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, or Texas?
-  Indiana.
- Okay.
This is amazing.
Look at this.
This whole place is your office.
Nope.
This is my office.
Ben, you're fired.
It's my office now.
Boom.
You heard the boss.
Scram, Wyatt.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How'd it go?
Um, I think okay.
- Yeah?
- Okay, I think.
Well, I have a surprise for you.
Uh, there's a swanky D.C. Cocktail party at the Hay-Adams, and I got us all on the list.
Wow, look at you.
You're a big shot.
Hey, uh, Benjamin, how fancy is this party tonight?
I mean, is this, like, a shorts or a pants kind of gala?
- Pants.
- Great.
Could we just real quick stop at the nearest place that has free pants?
I know that Ron doesn't want us to eat anything before the meat, but I smuggled in some candy.
Oh, thank God.
I'm starving.
Raisins?
It's nature's candy.
Now, they're basically grapes.
So remember to pace yourself.
I can't even follow my own advice.
It's too delicious.
Oh, my God.
Did you put glitter in the laundry detergent?
Oh, yeah.
I'm experimenting with some new entrepreneurial ideas.
That one's called "Sparkle Suds".
Dress loud.
Will you stop putting glitter in everything?
This morning you put glitter in the butter.
"Disco Dairy".
Spread the party.
No, that's not a good idea.
That's terrible.
Well, the target demographic isn't angry, middle-aged nurses.
- Oh--shh, stop it--hey.
- Wait-- Hey.
I'm going to get in line for some food.
Y'all want anything?
- We're good.
We're really good.
- Nope.
Just spending a little time with my baby girl.
Ew.
Get off me.
There's so much free food at this party, honey.
I love politics.
Look, I made a shrimp claw.
I'm really proud of you, babe.
Now put your used plate in my purse.
I almost have a complete set.
Really?
Oh, my God.
You're so smart.
They say it will pass, but we'll only get $400 million instead of $900 million.
Kate works at the Pentagon and Lacey works for Eric Cantor.
What do you do, Leslie?
I was just recently elected.
I'm a councilwoman.
Local government is so important.
My grandma's on the city council in her town.
Gives her a reason to leave the house.
Oh.
Where did you say you were from?
It's called Pawnee.
Pawnee, Missouri?
Oh, my-- that is so random.
I've been there-- totally cute.
Pawnee, Indiana.
Pawnee, Missouri, is a total craphole.
Ben and I both did some amazing things today.
He scored a victory for the congressional campaign he's working on.
And I was mistaken for Beverly D'Angelo by a Japanese tourist.
So, pretty big day for both of us.
Ron, can I have a burger?
I'm hungry.
For the last time, no burgers yet.
I've got ribs, and I've got beef cheek.
Ron, where are my vegan soy patties?
Oh, I gave them to the kids.
They love them.
They're skipping them across the pond.
Donna, I got to go to the boys' room.
- Can I have a ride in your car?
- Absolutely not.
This barbecue stinks.
I'm saying it.
It stinks.
Do you have any plates or anything?
I mean, how are we supposed to eat these rumps?
Ron, if no one takes me to the bathroom, I'm just going to have to go in the trees.
All right.
Forget it.
You have ruined a perfectly good barbecue with your demands and chatter.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
Does anybody feel like they can't breathe?
- I think I need some fresh air.
- We're outside.
God, these women-- they're so smart and accomplished and pretty.
And they're tall.
Why are they all so tall?
It's like C-Span and Neiman Marcus had kids or something.
Hey, so there's a couple more people I want you to meet.
Great.
I can't wait to meet, like, five more tall women.
Excuse me, Senators?
Ben Wyatt, from Congressman Murray's campaign.
Ben, I remember you from the Kennedy Center.
- That's right.
- Yeah.
I wanted to introduce my friend Leslie Knope-- Senators Barbara Boxer and Olympia Snow.
- A pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do?
So, Leslie, what do you do?
I am a city councilwoman from Pawnee, Indiana.
But you've probably never heard of us.
We're small and unimportant.
- I'm sure that's not true.
- But it is.
We've got tons of problems.
We're overrun with raccoons and obese toddlers.
Anyway, I'm probably boring you.
I just wanted to say that you are my role models, and, uh, you are incredibly amazing women, and it is an honor to meet you, and I really respect your grace under pressure,  And thank you for your time.
Excuse me, Senators.
Uh, Leslie?
Hello?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm just tired, okay?
I saw 24 historical sights in a day, and it's 120 degrees out with 200% humidity, 'cause this is a stupid swamp town.
Okay, that would make anyone cranky.
- I'm not cranky.
- Okay.
I thought you'd enjoy meeting numbers 4 and 26 on Leslie's list of amazing women.
I do.
I did.
You're the most amazing boyfriend ever.
And if you don't get out of here soon, I'm going to punch you in the face.
Journal needs a quote for the profile.
It's fine.
Just go.
I'll see you at your apartment later.
This is Ben Wyatt.
Excuse me.
I just need to get my coat here.
Could you give me a minute here, please?
Are you-- are you okay?
Can I get you anything?
I-I would like you to just leave and give me a little privacy here, please.
All right.
I'm sorry.
I hope everything's okay.
Nosy people have no respect for personal space.
Ann what the hell?
I put glitter in all your moisturizers and lotions.
I'm calling it "Sparkle Skin", by Annie.
Twinkle, twinkle, big star.
Ann!
That is an amazing idea, and I will buy it from you, but never do that again.
That was really expensive moisturizer.
Yeah, well, you ruined all of my clothes.
Well, then, I did you a huge favor, 'cause they stink.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
Oh, hello, lovers.
- Oh.
- Tom!
You're amazing!
Kiss me more!
- Uh-huh.
- All right.
Enough of this.
Y'all broke up a long time ago, didn't you?
No.
We're stronger than ever, so It's all right.
I'ma let y'all have this one.
As someone who has lied a lot about various aspects of a myriad of relationships, I respect the effort you've gone to.
Let's call off the bet.
Thanks, Donna.
No problem.
- I guess that's it.
- Yep.
The end of a relationship.
And the beginning of a partnership.
Let's talk "Sparkle Skin".
Do we know anyone in product development over at Sephora?
Good-bye, Tom.
Here's a picture of me and April making out in her apartment.
- Oh.
- Here's a picture of us making out in Ben's office.
This is a picture-- oh, this is us making out-- I don't know where that is, but you can tell that she's sucking on my lip.
Traveling.
Making out-- are you okay, boss?
No.
Not really.
I know I should be focusing on this river cleanup, but all I keep thinking about is Ben laughing in a helicopter with Hot Rebecca.
- Who's Hot Rebecca?
-  She's just this jealousy amalgam I created.
I combined all of the giant, dark-haired, smartphone power goddesses into one woman called Hot Rebecca.
- Ah.
- I mean, Ben's life is filled with senators and briefings and Super PACs.
I can't even get a meeting with some bureaucrat.
I don't even know what a bureaucrat is.
Everything's going to be fine with you and Ben, because if I know Ben, he, too, is an amalgam.
- No.
- Yeah.
Point is, you're better than Hot Rebecca.
You're kickass Leslie.
Long-distance relationships are never easy, but you never, ever give up on stuff.
Thanks.
- That's what makes you - Nope.
An amalgam.
Nailed it.
Ron, a word?
Are you aware of what's going on out in your department?
I am.
My department is pouting because I didn't put on a puppet show based on the funniest email chain of the year.
I would have liked to have seen that show.
My nomination was Jerry accidentally forwards his bank statement to everyone.
Classic And depressing.
The point of a barbecue is not to do hokey, office joke theater.
The point is-- The point of the barbecue was to thank the department.
It was an employee-appreciation barbecue.
Ron, I gave you the chance to become assistant city manager.
And you chose to stay here, which is fine.
But if you're going to lead the department, you occasionally have to lead the department.
And I say that as one of your closest colleagues and dearest friends But also as your boss.
I went to our nation's capital this weekend in order to apply for a federal grant to clean up our city's river.
But things move pretty slow in Washington, and I'm not going to wait around.
Now, I was recently reminded by someone that I'm not the type of person to shy away from hard work.
What?
Did I-- Do you need something from me right now?
No, no, no.
Never mind.
Point is, I'm going to clean up this river by myself.
Every Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., I will be here.
Those are my office hours.
If you want to come and talk to me or ask me questions or raise an issue, this is where I'll be.
Let's get to work, Pawnee.
Oh, my God.
The smell is so much worse when you get up close.
Yeah.
Oh, look, a handgun.
I call it.
- Holy-- - Whoa!
Everyone, get in here now!
Your work is appreciated.
Eat some corn.
- Wow.
Thank you, Ron.
- Thanks, boss.
- Thanks, Ron.
- Thanks, Ron.
Also, here's Tom.
Aah!
It actually smells really delicious.
It really does.
Give me some of Tommy's ribs.
- Oh, heck, yeah.
- Sorry, Tom.
Oh, my God.
That's good.
I mean, if I'd known it didn't go well with the guy from Interior, I-- No, no, no.
You did nothing wrong.
I'm so happy for you and how much everyone loves you and how great you're doing.
I just freaked out.
I'm sorry.
Long distance sucks.
It does.
But we can do this, right?
Yeah, definitely.
Can you come visit next month?
We can take a proper tour of the sights.
There's only one sight I want to see right now.
All right, I mean, this is getting weird, but, uh, there it is.
I meant the Jefferson Memorial, you perv.
Right.
Sorry.
Sorry, I-I don't, uh-- I'm--I'm just-- Wait.
No, you didn't.
No, I didn't.
- Spin it around and back it on up.
- All right.
The White House-- America's most whitest house-- most notably is where Sinbad lived in the film First Kid.
Sinbad, wow.
The other tour guide never said anything about that.
Do you know why it's called the Oval Office?
No.
Because of a man-- Oval Redenbacher - What?
- Popcorn inventor.
He used to hang out with John F. Kennedy.
Excuse me.
Attention, everyone.
This tour guide is the most amazing tour guide there ever was.
Please, step up.
$200 cash up front.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Andy and Lesile sent us care packages.
"Hey Ben, just a few things to remind you of home".
"Love, Leslie".
Ah, Waffle Mix.
JJ's diner mug.
New pajamas.
Wow, there's a lot of stuff in here.
"Box 1 of 12"?
"April, here's something to help you remember our three-legged dog champion".
Ah, that's cute.
"Also, you are way better at laundry.
"Can you please do mine and send it back to me?
Thanks.
Love you.
Mouse Rat rules.
Love, Andy".
Less cute.
"P.S. Please hurry.
"I've been wearing a bandana as underwear for three days now".
Look, there's a picture.
Ah!
That's horrifying.
I love him so much.
Okay, so do you have the results of the study?
Yes, and they're great.
Your tax on soda would definitely lower diabetes in this town.
Oh, and I have a great prop for the meeting.
This is the amount of sugar that the average Pawnee from soda, every month.
- That is gross.
- It's gross.
- All that sugar?
- It's really gross.
- What a powerful image.
- What are you doing?
What did you put in the sugar?
It's so good.
My first act as a city councilwoman-- I've proposed a tax on all those giant sugary sodas so we can discourage people from drinking them.
I believe, with my help, all local restaurants can get healthier-- Paunch Burger, Big and Wide, The Fat Sack, Coronel Plum's Slop Trough-- which was formerly Sue's Salads until we ran that out of town.
Ah, councilwoman.
In honor of your never-ending quest to personally babysit each and every American citizen, I went to Paunch Burger and got myself a Number two-- Double Bacon Grenade Deluxe, hash browns, chili cheese fries, and one poached egg.
Ugh!
Number two is right.
I also picked up a 64-ounce Sweetums Sugar Splash.
Damn it, I love this country so much.
Ron, I'm really glad that you're here.
Our political differences aside, I am about to go to my first committee meeting as a city councilwoman.
There's something I need to say to you.
Please don't.
I know you hate feelings and emotions, but I would not be where I am if it wasn't for you.
You hired me.
You've always supported me.
How can I ever repay you?
Get me a refill.
Hey, everybody.
So, I've been going over your reports.
Let's try to be consistent There's a crazy amount in these memos.
Yeah, people.
Times New Roman, across the board.
No Geneva, no Garamond, definitely no Papyrus.
Papyrus?
Are you kidding me?
There's no place for that in a professional office setting.
Yes!
Thank you, April.
These college interns really need to be whipped into shape, but don't worry, because they call me Devo, 'cause I can "whip 'em good".
And obviously make sure the content's perfect too.
Oh, and, uh, 12 point.
Great meeting.
Out of the way, people.
Motivational brigade coming through.
Ho ho!
So, you boys are gonna go work out together, huh?
Nice.
Whereabouts?
Community college.
Eh, that's too far.
Chris and Tom offered to help me train to become a police officer.
The physical exam is about three months away and I am in terrible shape, but I can already do this So, I'm getting there.
So, I've got a list of everything that I'm supposed to be able to do to get into the police academy, and number one is, "be able to run 2 miles in under 25 minutes".
That's a typo, right?
I mean, that's humanly impossible.
When you are able to focus your mind and your body, anything is possible.
Anything is possible!
Ms. Pinewood, recently, many of the local restaurants have changed their "small-size" option to a whopping 64-ounces.
That's correct, and it's great for the consumer.
More bang for the buck.
Are we putting bargains on trial here?
How could any sane person call that "small"?
Well, if the customer truly wants a smaller size, there is an option.
Oh, do you mean the "li'I swallow"?
Does anybody buy that?
Some girls buy them for their dollhouses, but they're not very popular.
I mean, for only a nickel more, you get 64 ounces.
Well, uh, Paunch Burger just recently came out with a new 128-ounce option.
Most people call it a gallon, but they call it the "regular".
Then, there is a horrifying that the call "child size".
How is this a "child-size soda"?
Well, it's roughly the size of a two-year-old child, if the child were liquefied.
It's a real bargain at $1.59.
I'm sorry, Ms. Pinewood, but why would anybody need this much soda?
It's not my place to speak for the consumer, but everyone should buy it.
Come on, Andy, come on.
You can do it.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
- Aah!
- Yes!
Oh, my God.
It's so hot.
It was horrible.
Oh, I'm going to die.
I'm so tired.
Everything hurts.
Running is impossible.
What are you doing?
Tom, now is not the time for criticism.
How did he do?
Andy finished his two-mile run in 29 minutes and 43 seconds.
No!
I'm never gonna be a cop.
I'm gonna have to be a robber.
Oh, come on.
Hang in there, pal.
I'm gonna drive around.
Andy, I'm proud of you.
Not because of what you did, which was terrible, but because of what I'm going to be able to get you to do.
I guess I'm proud of me.
Thanks, man.
Me too.
We have so much work to do.
Oh, hey, Ellis, have you put the campaign pictures up on the website?
Oh.
Yeah.
I started doing them.
And are you going to finish doing them?
Oh.
Later, man.
I actually think you look really good, except for the stick up your butt.
Who do you think drew it?
Was it Nathaniel?
Ellis?
Man, I feel like these interns do not respect or like me at all.
Honestly, you could loosen up a bit And everything in general.
God, this is insane.
They're interns.
They're totally replaceable, and I'm their boss.
Just fire them.
Uh, hey, Jen.
Listen, I'm having a problem with some of the interns.
I'm thinking of making some changes.
Yeah.
Turns out Ellis is Congressman Murray's nephew.
Nathaniel is related to Donald Rumsfeld.
Brittany's dad is Ben Bernanke's dentist.
Every single one of these little twerps is seriously connected.
So, new plan.
Instead of firing them, I am going to kiss their asses like crazy.
Ms. Knope, this is about consumer rights, and if they don't want to drink our delicious sodas, we do provide healthier options, like water zero.
Oh, yes.
Let's talk about water zero.
The name implies that there are zero calories, like most water, but in fact, it has 300 calories per serving.
Isn't that misleading?
The zero on the label refers to the amount of water in it, which is zero.
If you want zero-calorie water, try diet water zero lite.
It has only 60 calories.
Okay, I think we're done here.
Thank you so much.
Oh, councilwoman, one more thing.
If your tax bill passes, local restaurants will hurt badly.
We'll have to lay off about 100 people.
You're bluffing.
She's bluffing.
Are you bluffing?
The second your tax bill passes, this press release goes wide.
See you at the meeting.
"Leslie Knope Soda Tax Forces Massive Layoffs".
Oh, my God, Ann.
I need some sugar.
No, no.
No, no, no!
Stop it!
Leslie, you stop it right now!
Okay, let's get started.
I proposed this bill, but the issue has become very complicated, so before I decide how I am going to vote, I'd love to hear from both sides.
Who'd like to start?
Yes.
Yeah, I work at Colonel Plump's, and word around the Slop Trough is, they're talking about laying people off.
So, maybe you could get off your high horse and help me keep my job.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Well, sir, I may vote against the tax, because, frankly, I don't take job losses lightly.
No.
I want the tax.
My husband started drinking those giant sodas, and he's gained 100 pounds in three months.
Consequently, we haven't had sex in ten years.
I-I thought you said he gained weight in the last three months.
Well, we have lots of other problems.
Well, ma'am, my original stance was that implementing this tax would be good for public health.
All taxation is theft!
If the government can tax me, I-I can--I can do this.
Grover, give that woman her purse back.
There's a lot of pill bottles in here.
Okay.
Been making some modifications to the pace car.
Speaker system, Mad Men bar, iPad dock, and bam!
Orange racing stripe.
It's a perfect recreation of Han lue's Nissan in The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift.
Weirdly, so far, no one has noticed.
I want to find something that really motivates you.
Why do you want to achieve this goal?
I just want to get a good job for me and April.
- Yes!
Keep going.
Dig.
- Okay, yeah.
Uh, I love April.
I think she's awesome.
She's all I care about in the whole world.
Yes.
Love and family.
What else is there, really?
Nothing at all.
I exercise because, when I was a baby, I had a rare blood disorder, and I suppose I need to feel like my body's in tip-top shape Ah.
So it doesn't destroy me, leaving me to die alone.
Great.
You got yours, I got mine.
I'm gonna go run till I puke.
Let's go.
Guess what's in these boxes, everybody?
What?
Pizza.
That's right.
Everybody chill out.
Take a pizza break on me.
Ellis, what's up, my male?
You grab a slice of 'za, brah.
All right.
Hey, dude, do you play Ultimate?
Yeah, I play intramural at Georgetown.
Dude, so did I, in college.
Whoa, you guys should get married.
We should play tomorrow morning in the park.
- What about the website?
- Whatever.
You can put those pics up anytime.
We should lock down some tight disc grabs, am I right, ell-bones?
- Yeah, it sounds good.
- Yeah?
It's better than working.
No doubt, no doubt.
All right, listen up, pizza lovers.
Tomorrow morning, pre-work Ultimate in the park.
Everybody's invited.
What do you say?
Let's do it to it, my dudes.
Okay, anyone else?
Yeah, if we put a tax on soda, I mean, what's next, income?
Sir, you don't pay your income tax?
Whether or not I pay income tax is none of the government's business.
Oh, well, no, actually, it is.
Well, you don't know my name or what I look like, so good luck finding me.
I think we should tax all bad things, like racism and women's vaginae.
We're not taxing anyone's genitals.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
Come on, boys.
Okay, um, let's take a quick straw poll.
Hold up green if you agree and red if you disagree.
Ann?
"The soda tax is good and will help people get healthier".
- So, about half?
- Half.
Okay, "the soda tax is bad and unfair to consumers".
Half and half.
Thank you very much.
This is very confusing.
I've got an idea.
Maybe instead of me losing my job, you ought to lose your job.
Let's recall Leslie Knope.
Let's do this!
Nice catch!
Someone please tell me we kodaked that moment.
Yeah, rocked that scoober!
Whoa!
You got it, Howie!
All right, April, what's the score?
Good sportsmanship, bro.
Sorry.
- Andy, repeat after me.
- Okay.
- "I run for April".
- I run for April.
Run for your wife, son!
- "I run for love".
- I run for love.
Playaz, at your marks.
What do you run for again, Chris?
Nobody.
Nothing.
Does it really even matter?
Get set.
Get at me!
Whoa!
Oh, hey, you okay?
No.
There's something wrong with my body.
- What?
- My legs aren't working.
I'm broken.
I need to go to the hospital and see a doctor right away.
Hey.
- Yikes.
You look weird.
- So do you.
That's a lie.
You always look beautiful.
Okay, well, I couldn't sleep a wink last night, so at 5:00 in the morning, I went to Paunch Burger for a pick-me-up.
I couldn't decide what kind of soda I wanted, so I had them put all six in one cup.
You know what it tastes like?
- Disgusting?
- Mm-hmm.
- How are you gonna vote?
- I don't know.
If I vote for the tax, then I might lose my job, and if I vote against it, I might be betraying my own bill.
It's like I'm floating in this giant river of ambiguity.
I'm under a warm waterfall of uncertainty.
Do you just have to pee real bad?
- Yes.
- Yeah.
I've lost all of my instincts.
I'm lost.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I'm just gonna have to wait, and when they call my name, I'll do what my gut tells me to do.
- Councilman Howser?
- Aye.
Councilman Howser votes aye.
Councilwoman Knope, how do you vote?
Oh, no.
Uhh!
Gentlemen, it appears that I have fallen ill.
Mayhaps, might I suggest that we have a re--aah!
Can we take a recess?
Well.
your pulse is super-fast, but that wouldn't be out of line for someone who drank and then barfed up a gallon of sugar water.
Wow, I'm a mess.
Everything's upside-down, you know?
I mean, when I used to just work here, I was always so sure of myself.
Now everything is different.
Jeez.
Do you guys know how to dissolve super glue?
Well, not everything's different, right?
Right.
Hey, Ellis.
Ell-bow.
Ell-chupacabra.
Drinkin' coffee.
- What?
- Oh, it's--it's a-- it's from 40 years ago.
Never mind.
Hey, that was really fun this morning, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah, totally.
- Uh - Oh, wow, look at that.
Did you draw that?
- Uh, no, I didn't.
- No, no, no, no, no.
It's really good.
I mean, you're a-- you're a great artist.
Oh, I can't do this.
Look, I don't care who you're related to.
I'm your boss, and you can't keep disrespecting me like this.
Hey, man, I didn't draw it.
Your daughter did.
- What?
- Her.
April's not my daughter.
She's my friend.
Does everyone think she's my daughter?
Whatever.
The point is, she would never do that to me.
Sorry, Dad.
Ron, my rock, my steady, guiding light.
O Captain, my Captain.
Did you get that soda refill I asked for?
I need you, Ron, okay?
I'm in big trouble.
I need to go back to those chambers in 20 minutes, and I have to cast a vote, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Ron, the people at the public forum said they might want to fire me.
So what?
I've tried to fire you.
Okay, Ron, come on.
Be serious.
I was not joking.
Here is your personnel file.
See for yourself.
"Brilliant work".
"Commendation".
"Above and beyond".
Keep reading.
"Request for termination"?
You tried to fire me once?
No, no, no, no.
I tried to fire you four times.
What--you--me--fou-- four--fired--times?
If you need to boot again, the trash can's on your right.
Hey, man, what'd the doc say?
Everything okay?
The tests and blood work came back, and the news is terrible.
They found nothing.
Nothing?
- Nothing.
The silent killer.
- Oh, my God.
Chris, that means everything's okay.
Why weren't you at practice this morning?
Yeah, you should have been there.
I finally hit my minimum requirement.
Minimum champion!
I'm going to die one day, probably, without ever having left my mark on this silly, little planet.
I'm gonna die an anonymous, meaningless speck of dust.
Wow.
It sounds like you're really going through some tough stuff right now.
It's too bad there's not doctors for your mind.
All right, well, hey, I'm gonna go run some more laps.
Will you time me?
Go.
He's kind of right, Chris.
You were freaking out because you were thinking about Andy and his family and how you don't have one.
Every time something tiny goes wrong, you spiral like crazy.
Maybe you should see a therapist.
I hope I'm not out of line.
Au contraire, mon frere.
You are as "in line" as a person can be.
You are a genius and an amazing motivator.
What was my time?
- I don't know.
43.
- Yes!
New record.
All my life, I have tried to achieve external goals.
Run a four-minute mile, climb Mount Everest.
But before I can do that, I need to climb the Mount Everest of my mind.
I don't understand.
Why did you try to get me fired?
The first year you worked here, you drove me nuts.
I would say no to something you wanted to do, and you'd ignore me or go over my head and do it anyway.
You were insubordinate, stubborn, a pain in my ass, and, worst of all, bubbly.
I was a dedicated public servant.
Right.
That was the worst thing you were.
The point is, I ended up withdrawing all four requests to have you fired, because, ultimately, I'd rather work with a person of conviction than a wishy-washy kiss-ass.
Well, I had conviction because I knew what I believed in, but I know with this new job.
I-I just feel like I've lost my bearings.
No, you haven't.
You may have wandered into unknown terrain, but you're still you.
You know what?
Are you gonna pull out some embarrassing photo of me from high school?
Take this compass.
All great adventurers need one.
Thank you, Ron.
And, listen, as far as this firing stuff goes, I won't forget and I will never forgive you.
There she is.
Here's that report you wanted, boss.
It's funny because it has and you only like one.
Do you like it?
Yeah, it's hilarious.
Okay, I'm sorry I drew those pictures of you.
I was just messing around.
Look, you may not take this seriously, but this job is important to me.
And by the way, you should take it seriously, because I asked you to come work here because I thought you'd enjoy it and I think you're smart, but you have to have some semblance of professionalism, and I need you to give, like, even a 15% effort.
- 12%.
- 15.
For God's sake, I'm asking for 15% effort.
It's not supposed to be a negotiation.
Fine.
I'm sorry.
15.
City councilwoman Knope, how do you vote?
Aye.
Strongly in favor.
The soda tax measure passes, Yes, I'm very pleased with my vote because I voted my conscience.
And by the way, she's totally bluffing about laying people off, you watch.
Anyway, I may have made some enemies today, but that is part of the job.
And who knows, maybe in the future, my enemies will become my friends.
Stranger things have happened.
Let's keep it down out there.
Yeah, I love cupcakes.
Ellis hates you, and he has herpes.
- Hey, what's your problem?
- My problem is you, Smellis.
Ben told you to finish the website, and if you don't do it, I swear to God, I'm gonna murder you in your sleep.
I know where you live.
I'm gonna get a melon baller and scoop your eyes out and eat them, and your congressman uncle is gonna have to buy you a dog to drag your eyeless face around.
Do you understand me?
Yes.
Do it.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hey, there you are.
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.
Where are you?
I'm in my new city council office.
- No way.
- I know, do you like it?
I love it.
I love it, too.
Check this out.
Here is my wall of inspirational women.
Ah.
Is that a picture of you?
Yes.
I am big enough to admit that I am often inspired by myself.
Here are my clocks.
Pawnee and Washington D.C. Same time zone.
Oh, this is the coolest part ever.
I have my own private bathroom.
Occupied!
- Oh my God.
- Ugh.
Councilman Jamm.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
I don't known if i would call it your bathroom.
Its only door is in my office.
I think it is crazy that the most junior city councilor gets a private bathroom just because she is a girl.
- Excuse me?
- Let's solve this.
Tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to drop my liquids in here, take my solids down the hall.
- Deal?
- No.
No deal.
Fine.
Your loss.
How?
Fun fact about me.
I recently began intensive psychotherapy.
I may have mentioned that to you already.
Several times.
Well, like my therapist says, "You can't share too much or too often".
You know, Gayle and I, we saw a couples therapist for a little while.
That's too much, Jerry.
For real.
Keep us out your bedroom.
It used to be, when I was down, I called my mother.
When I lacked self-confidence, I called my running coach.
And now, no matter what emotion I'm feeling, I call one number-- my therapist.
I want to do the same thing for the city.
A psychotherapist for the city.
No, Andy.
- No.
- A 311 line.
Citizens will call 311 for whatever problem they have.
Uncollected garbage, broken streetlight, and we will direct them to the proper department.
Chris, great idea.
Thank you, Andy.
I agree.
I love this idea.
And I love me for thinking of it.
My therapist said that I need to be more vocal about appreciating myself.
Thank you, Chris.
You're welcome, Chris.
I sound insane.
I'm going to go talk to my therapist.
Welcome to Pawnee Today.
I am first-rate newswoman Joan Callamezzo.
Pawnee's City Council approval rate is at a dismal 3%.
That's an all-time low.
Yuck.
Leslie, the city council has done very little over the past few years, and what they have accomplished, in my opinion, has been embarrassing.
And that is a fact.
No, that's your opinion.
That's the definition of an opinion.
Well, that's your opinion.
The city council has some political gridlock and some partisan bickering, but we're actually about to pass a bill-- my bill-- the Leslie Knope Fun In The Sun Act, which will extend public pool hours citywide.
Can you say, "big whoop"?
Recently, the Captain of the Pawnee Porpoises swim team asked me if we could keep the public pools open longer so they could log more practice time, and I said, "Absolutely".
Because not only am I a city councilor.
I'm a city councilor with porpoise.
By passing the bill, and extending pool hours, we are saying to our citizens that this City Council is determined to better our town.
Okay, Pawnee Porpoises youth swim team, I have a question for you.
What is your greatest accomplishment?
We came in fourth in the County swim meet last year.
Wrong, your greatest accomplishment is happening in two hours when this bill becomes law.
Yay.
I just want you to be very proud of yourselves, because this bill is going to start a long romance between the city and its government.
Porpoise call!
What are you doing?
I'm doing a porpoise call, which we used to do when I was part of your group, but it seems like you don't do it any more and that's fine.
I'm not weird.
Okay, everybody leave.
I'll see you at the city council meeting.
Hey, are you busy?
And writing Star Trek fan fiction does not count.
Ha ha ha.
I finished it last week.
What's going on?
Um, I miss Andy.
And you probably miss your lover, Chris.
Leslie.
I had an idea.
It's Friday.
Pawnee's only a ten-hour drive.
Road trip?
Oh, I don't know, I was going to try to get a jump on some work this weekend.
Dude, 30 years from now, when you're on your deathbed, what are you going to remember?
Organizing files or taking a spontaneous road trip to surprise Leslie?
Yeah, you know what?
All right, I'm in.
You know, we might be able to sneak out early.
You get snacks.
I'll bring music.
We'll jam out to some sweet tunage.
You know what?
This is awesome.
Actually, no.
I don't want to go any more.
Oh.
Okay.
Just kidding.
See you in ten minutes.
Okay.
Just kidding.
We're not going.
Road trip!
So we're going?
Yes!
Oh, I'm excited to bond a little with April.
She's like the little sister I never had.
Because the little sister I do have is normal and not terrifying.
- 311.
- Well, Diane, for potholes, you want to speak with Public Works.
I understand you've tried them four times.
Government is inefficient and should be dissolved.
Please hold while I transfer you.
Donna, can you help me?
I got a 311 call, but it was all static.
That sounds like an I.T. Problem.
Well, how do I get I.T. Here?
Call 311.
Oh, hello again, Diane.
Nobody answered?
Okay, you know what?
Someone will be there shortly.
Andrew, get your lunch, some water, and a 40-pound bag of asphalt.
Okay, boss.
What are we doing?
- We're fixing a pothole.
- Hey!
Pawnee 311.
How can I help-- Oh, no.
No, this is not 911.
No, no.
This is 311.
Donna, they switched my phone with 911.
What do I do?
I don't know.
Try to help.
Now hush.
It is heating up in this piece.
Oh, that sounds awful.
Good lord, it is hot.
Yes, mercy me.
Living in this town's like living in the devil's butt crack.
Almost out of gas.
I'll wait till we're on the highway.
Now, the GPS says we should take 495 to 270, but check out this cool alternate route I fou-- Oh, my God, that is so interesting to me because I'm a map salesman.
Why aren't we moving?
Because.
Other cars.
Will you not do that?
Please don't.
That's what you do when you-- Please don't do-- Oh, great, here comes a guy.
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm?
- Why aren't we moving?
- Exit's closed for a bit.
Presidential motorcade.
I'll just shut off the car till it opens up.
Holy , it's hot.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Beautiful, Tom.
Beautiful.
- Dynamite gums.
- Aw, thanks.
Tom, do you want to know why I moved to Pawnee?
Sure.
It's because the two leading industries here are corn syrup and rubber nipples.
It is a dentistry jackpot.
It's genius, right?
Well, D.D.S. Doesn't stand for "dumb, dumb, stupid".
I like that.
I'm going to steal it.
That's mine now.
All right.
Cool.
Councilman Jamm and I have gotten pretty tight.
And I'm hoping to parlay this into a membership at the Pawnee Smokehouse, Pawnee's most exclusive cigar club.
Overstuffed leather chairs, top-shelf brandies.
And that stale tobacco stench that says, "Welcome to the top".
You're a member of the Pawnee Smokehouse, right?
- Oh, yeah.
- Man, I love a good stogie.
I actually just had this personalized cigar cutter made.
Whoa.
Real nice.
Not my initials, but thank you so much.
Oh, well, it's not-- Okay.
Hey, so, uh, we're still all good on Leslie's bill, right?
Actually, Tommy, we need to talk.
I have wanted this perm since middle school.
I could not be more excited about this.
- Are you excited, Autumn?
- Yeah, definitely.
Do you ever give a perm to someone and ever regret it?
Uh Ann has told me repeatedly not to get a perm.
But Ann's not here.
So when the Ann's away, the mice get perms.
Councilman Jamm changed his vote.
He's voting no on fun in the sun.
What?
Why?
He promised me.
He just said that he changed his mind.
Then he told me some veneers could really make my smile pop.
Thoughts?
Oh, my God.
The vote is in an hour.
Okay, we need to have an emergency strategy session now.
- What about the perm?
- The perm must wait, Autumn!
The perm must wait.
Wait So this means the bill isn't going to pass?
My parents said that you guys can't get anything done.
Now, wait, okay, hold on.
This isn't over by a long shot.
But it's three to two against us.
Yeah, I know how to do math, Mason.
Okay, don't be an alarmist.
It's very important that we stay positive.
Our positive attitude is our greatest asset.
- Tom, a word, please.
- Mm-hmm.
The bill is dead, the Porpoises are doomed, and democracy is over.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe I decided to get a perm.
Ann should have never let me do this.
Look, Jamm saw you on Pawnee Today.
He knows how much you want this.
He's just trying to get something in return.
This is a bargaining tool.
You know, this is why people hate the government.
'Cause just when we're about to do something really good, it all falls apart due to some stupid, selfish jerk butt.
You know, screw Jamm.
Screw Jamm.
I'm just going to try to get Councilman Milton's vote.
Milton?
He's, like, 150 years old.
Yeah.
He's got grandkids, okay?
And--and kids love to swim.
And he'll give us his vote.
He's an old person, and I'll talk to him really slowly.
He won't even know what he's doing.
I just need to hurry up.
How do I look?
I don't know how to answer that.
Hi, I'm Andy.
I really like your dress.
- I'm a princess.
- I'm a mermaid.
I'm the director of Parks and Recreation.
I'm here to fix that hole.
This is our kingdom.
You have to ask permission.
Excuse me?
Your highnesses, we do humbly request thine permission to befix doth holes yonder.
Only if you can tag us.
Come here.
Your tax dollars at work.
Soundtrack to Pulp Fiction, soundtrack to Singles, soundtrack to Grosse Pointe Blank.
Why do you have so many soundtracks?
Oh, well, uh, I kind of look at it like it's your favorite directors making a mix tape just for you.
Eww.
Oh, here's something.
"Benji's Cool Times Summer Jamz Mix".
Oh, no, I--you probably don't want to listen to that - Yes, I want to listen to it.
- Just 'cause--no, listen, it-- - I want to listen to it.
- We don't--we don't-- - I wanna hear what's on it.
- We don't need to-- April Shoop Ooh, how you doin'?
Here I go, here I go, here I go again girl, what's my weakness?
Really?
Don't judge me.
Councilman, I'd like to talk to you about the Fun In The Sun bill, and I don't mean to rush you, but the vote is in an hour.
When I'm done eating, we'll talk.
I've eaten the same lunch for 58 years.
Caesar salad, extra dressing, extra croutons, and extra anchovies.
Mmm.
Councilman Milton was first elected as a city councilor in 1948, as a member of the Dixiecrat Party.
Their platform?
"De-integrate Baseball".
The secret is in the dressing.
Try it.
It's an aphrodisiac.
You too, my strange, foreign friend.
- No, thank you.
- Tom, eat some.
I'm not eating racist salad.
The more we eat, the faster we talk.
Mmm.
You can really taste the ignorance.
It's pronounced "anchovies".
Hi.
Diane Lewis.
I own this pothole.
Ron Swanson.
I'm here to fix it.
Oh, seaweed choke!
Ugh!
That large boy is my colleague.
We work at the Parks Department.
Oh, you're not even from the Public Works Department?
Look, it appeared that no one from the proper channels was gonna fix this, so I decided to do it myself.
Do you know what you're doing?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, I do.
Councilman, you have grandchildren-- And seven great-grandkids.
Tim, Mary, Jack, uh, Tim, Marie, Tim, and Mary.
Don't forget about Tim.
Right, Tim.
How many is that?
You know, it's very hard to tell.
This might not work.
Let me find Jamm, see if he'll bargain.
Mm-hmm.
What country is he from?
Iceland.
"Data had never felt this way before.
"Of course, data had never felt anything before.
"But Captain Picard couldn't help but note "the smile that crept over his mechanical but lifelike face".
I'm gonna murder you.
I understand.
Just one second.
"As they walked down the hall into the bridge--" Lemonade?
Please and thank you.
Hey, I'm sorry if I was curt earlier.
I'm a single mom, and sometimes things get chaotic around here.
When you showed up from the Parks Department-- No need to apologize.
I understand completely.
This is delicious.
Well, I got it from Food and Stuff, so-- That's where I got these gloves.
Right?
So, how exactly are you gonna fix this hole?
Just for my own edification.
Uh, I dug the loose gravel out of the hole.
Now I'm using a jackhammer to remove the larger pieces, then I'll spray down the hole to settle the dust and fill it with cold patch asphalt.
Well, thank you.
Now I can fix the next one myself.
Ron and Diane sitting in a tree k-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i.
Do you hear that bird?
Jamm!
What do you want?
Support of one of your bills?
Committee chairmanship?
- I want your toilet.
- What?
Your office, with the private bathroom?
He wants your office.
Yeah, I don't mean to brag, but, uh, I've got Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
This isn't even about policy?
Absolutely not.
- This is a no-brainer.
Just make the trade, everyone's happy.
I'm not happy.
He shoots down a very helpful bill 'cause he doesn't get to poop wherever he wants?
No, I'm gonna get Councilman Milton, and you can put your butt back in your pants, sir.
Yeah, well, love the hair!
Andy, come help me tamp this down.
For the last time, Ron, it's princess rainbow sparkle.
Holy Moses.
Can we turn you into a princess?
No.
I think it would really make Diane happy.
Why would that matter?
Shut up.
Ooh.
Would you please come help me tamp this down?
It's a job that requires two men.
Or does it require two princesses?
- Please?
- Please?
Please?
Oh.
This is impressive.
You remind me of a young, beautiful Strom Thurmond.
Yes, I've been saying that for years.
Councilman Milton, do I have your vote?
- Yes, indeed.
- Oh.
Oh, there's a lot of salad dressing on your hand.
Shall we kiss?
Huh?
No.
No!
- Aah!
Oh!
- Oh!
- Oh.
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
Please be okay.
Please, still be able to vote.
We can kiss if you want to.
With tongue?
Hey!
No.
She tried to kiss me.
She was insatiable.
Well, I don't know, maybe we should, you know, postpone the vote until the councilman gets better, you know?
Uh, yeah, we're not postponing anything, okay?
I'm pushing the vote through and it won't pass.
Complimentary toothbrush?
You're missing the backs of your upper canines.
Sloppy technique.
Excuse me?
I have excellent toothbrush technique.
Just give him what he wants.
Take the easy way out.
I always do.
It's so easy.
I do not negotiate with dentists.
I'm trying to tell everybody that the government is great, and I think it stinks.
I hate it.
I hate the government.
- You don't mean that.
- You're right, I don't.
I take it back.
Why did I say that, Tom?
God, you know me so well.
More Rouge!
Everything going good?
I came here to fix a pothole, not be mocked.
I'm sorry, it's just-- your face is ridiculous.
Thank you for the lemonade.
The asphalt will bear weight in an hour.
- Time to go, Andrew.
- No!
Wait, but we were gonna make a sparkle palace!
Ron, you're walking across hot lava!
- Oh!
- Oh, no!
Whoa, it's moving.
- It's moving.
- What?
- Yes!
- Finally.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
- What?
- No!
We're out of gas.
Aah!
Aah!
Next order of business, the Fun In The Sun Act, introduced by Councilwoman Knope.
Councilman, I move that the bill be read in its entirety.
- Ms. Beavers?
- Fine.
Pawnee Municipal Code Amendment, 217-426 Buying time, I see.
What's up?
You can have my office.
Okay, why don't you, uh-- why don't you sweeten the pot?
You can have my parking space.
And?
And I will get Invisaligns from you.
And?
And, that is enough.
And shut up.
And I hate you.
We got a deal.
Can't wait to drop my kids at the pool.
- By "kids," I mean turds.
- I get it.
Yeah.
Then Ana asks Grey to punish her.
Donna, please, can you keep it down?
Or at least research how to deliver a baby that's coming out face up.
Lay the mother on her side and try to move the baby in a corkscrew fashion.
Diane is awesome and she likes you.
And you like her.
I can tell.
"A," I don't recall inviting you in here, and "B," I did not like her.
She's not my type.
Her life is messy.
Ron, messy is fun, okay?
My whole life is a giant mess and I love it.
I mean, look at my hair.
I have gum in my hair.
Listen, I will not pursue Diane.
End of story.
- Please, just steer.
- Be stronger.
Ow.
That was a great road trip.
We made it 40 feet.
Yeah, well, at least it took a million hours, and it was 180 degrees, - and we starved to death.
- So fun.
Hey, how about next weekend we fly to Pawnee?
- Tickets are on me.
- Really?
That would be awesome.
Definitely.
Nah, never mind.
I don't feel like it.
What?
Oh, my God.
See how it feels?
Excellent work, everyone!
Particularly you, Ron.
You have one very satisfied citizen.
What did you do for her?
I fixed her pothole.
Is that a euphemism?
- No.
- Then great work.
In fact, she's out in the hallway and wants to thank you herself.
If you're here to complain about the pothole, I guarantee I did it correctly.
Actually, I'm here to ask you out for dinner.
Really?
Well, I hope you're not the kind of man who needs to ask the lady out.
I'm a middle school vice-principal.
I don't screw around.
Does that freak you out?
No, on the contrary.
So, dinner?
Please and thank you.
Well, it'll be casual.
No need to wear makeup.
I begrudgingly admit that the 311 program is a moderate success.
I'm still not sure why the citizen decided to come speak with me in person, but I'm just happy to see a government program finally work.
Okay, so let's get ready for the photo, guys.
I want you to arrange yourselves from most excited about democracy to least excited.
Wait a minute.
Everybody's excited?
I bet you are!
Because your bill just became law.
Boy, you know, I can't believe you traded your office to keep this craphole pool open for a couple more weeks a year.
Hey, can you not say that in front of the kids, please?
I'm trying to teach them how great government is.
Oh, this is a teaching moment?
Great.
Hey, uh, kids?
Would you like to learn how Leslie got your bill passed?
Councilwoman Knope traded my vote for her-- What the hell, man?
Why'd you do that?
Um Um, because it's fun in the sun!
Everybody in the pool!
Yay, pool!
Yay, democracy!
Oh, no, my perm.
Ta da.
What do you see?
- Your new city council office.
- Yes.
And it is across the courtyard from your office, so we can wave at each other.
But it is also Pawnee's newest and most exclusive cigar club, Tom's Smokehouse.
Whoa!
"Smoke Dog".
And the Tommy Haverford member's chair.
Now you're talking.
Man, Jamm's gotta be pretty mad at us.
I ain't scared of him.
He's a punk.
To making things happen.
I'll puff to that.
I do not like this.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Mr. Haverford, on the morning of your crash - were you alone in your car?
- Yes.
Your Honor, this was an accident.
Plain and simple.
I don't want to put words in your mouth but case dismissed.
And you were texting at the time, correct?
How dare you, sir?
I was tweeting.
Please, read Exhibit C, the transcript of your Twitter page leading to the immediatelly following crash.
"9:15.
Four green lights in a row.
#blessed" "9:17.
Drive faster, blue Civic.
Daaaaaamn.
#soccermoms" "9:18.
Gotta pass this lady on the 'ejkerkj'".
That's when I hit the fire hydrant.
Sorry, allegedly hit the fire hydrant.
"9:20.
Just hit a fire hydrant, but I survived.
"#unbreakable.
"#what'sMr.Glassuptothesedays?
whynosequel"?
Prosecution rests, Your Honor.
Mr. Haverford, you have a problem keeping your eyes on the road and off your electronic devices.
I'm going to tailor a punishment to fit the crime.
One week without screens.
No phone, tablets, computers, television--anything.
No!
Please, send me to jail!
Any slipups, and that week becomes a month.
Turn in your phone, please.
Fine.
One last tweet?
Bailiff!
Pr-press send, bailiff!
Press send!
Howdy.
Hey!
What's with the get-up?
I just got back from that dude ranch with Ricky.
It was really fun.
He bought this for me as a gift.
A cowboy hat from your cowboyfriend.
Oh, that makes it sound like he's a cow.
From your cowboy boyfriend.
Your boycow-cowboy.
- Just call him "Ricky".
- Okay, great.
Okay, everyone.
Great news: Lots of old people have chlamydia.
Whoo!
Seniors in Pawnee have a lot of time on their hands, and what they're doing with that time is going at it hard, old people-style.
A lot of them haven't had proper sex education, and as a result, STDs are having a field day.
It's amazing what a few old guys can do with a little bit of charm and a lot of crabs.
Okay, sex avengers, these old fogies are very set in their ways.
They're hopped up on E.D. medication and they got nothing to lose, 'cause they're close to death.
Also, seniors can be pretty ornery.
Uh, actually, I think it's pronounced "horny".
I have an idea.
Let's pretend that we're old people, and we can ask Ann our grossest, most perverted sex questions.
I'll start.
I'm an old lady, why do I need birth control?
I haven't had my monthly since LBJ was president.
Well, with the elderly, we are not so concerned with pregnancy.
We're more concerned with disease.
Do pubic hairs get longer the older you get?
I don't think so, no.
Because that's happening to me.
What should I do?
Where can I get lube that is healthy to eat?
I ran over my testicles with my jazzy scooter.
I think you're good to go, nursey.
I want to jump on that caboose.
Choo choo!
You should never eat lube, you need to see a doctor immediately, and I'm sorry, sir, but you have to be under 40 to ride this train.
Oh!
That's how you do it, kids.
Nice.
"LeRon James".
We still on for breakfast?
You are an hour and a half late for work.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I can't use my GPS, but I figured it out.
I just drove around in circles until I saw something familiar.
You live 3 miles from here.
according to my GPS, which I used to use every day.
I can't use screens for a week.
Big deal!
I'm adapting.
I built a real-life Pinterest board.
I really wish you could click those.
Wow, there he is, Barack Obama.
His name is congressman David Murray, he is our boss and he is white.
Don't embarrass me.
Congressman Murray, I'm Ben Wyatt, coordinating director of D.C. Operations.
And I am April Blart, mall cop.
Great!
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Ben.
Heard such great things.
Oh, well, I really feel like I know you already.
I've watched all of your speeches and debates.
It's very inspiring.
Thank you, Ben.
And thank you all for your hard work.
Now, stay cool.
It's a hot one out there today.
That's right, you could practically cook an egg on the sidewalk.
Terrific.
Okay, let's make sure we're ready for the strategy session tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Hey, we're still gonna assassinate him, right?
- Don't say that.
- Ben!
What the hell is he doing?
Hello, can everyone hear me okay?
No.
Okay, great.
I'm councilwoman Leslie Knope, and today we are here to talk about safe sex.
I know this is a personal question, but how many of you out there are sexually active?
Oh, my.
I have two partners, often at the same time.
Wow.
Thank you.
Does anyone know what we risk when we have unprotected sex?
- Heart attack.
- Falling in love.
Partner dies on top of you!
Yes, but the truth is, the greatest risk you face is sexually transmitted diseases.
Are these old people really having sex with each other?
Yeah, what'd you think they were doing?
I don't know, I thought we were just talking about it.
Oh!
And the best way to prevent them is to use protection.
Well, that's all fine and good, but what if the banana is soft and mushy, and doglegs sharply to the left?
Oh, my God, Jerry, when you check your email, you go to Altavista and type "Please go to yahoo.com"?
Well, how else would I do it?
You don't have your email bookmarked?
Do you have any bookmarks?
What's bookmarks?
God, Jerry!
You don't deserve the Internet!
I'm going crazy, Ron!
Life without screens is pointless.
I made an iPhone out of paper.
It's not the same, though.
This is the work of a lunatic.
You need to detox.
Tomorrow, we'll go to my cabin in the woods.
It's so far away from civilization, the electric company is not even aware there's a structure there.
Thanks, Ron.
And hey, can you give me a ride after work?
There's no chance I can find my way home.
If you encounter this scenario, simply execute the following maneuver.
And stop!
Great job, and very informative, but we need to stop now forever and pretend like this never happened.
Why?
What happening?
Oh, boy.
Marcia and Marshall Langman are the town's morality watchdogs.
Marcia is motivated, calculating, and hyper-vigilant, and her husband, Marshall, is vivacious.
This, that's happening here, is not allowed!
We at the society for family stability foundation object to this smut being taught.
It's against Pawnee's abstinence-only sex education law.
That's only for schools.
Actually, it's not.
The way the bill is drafted prohibits any government employee from teaching anything but abstinence, city-wide.
- Thank you, Chris.
- You're welcome.
If we allow this filth to be taught to our seniors, the next you thing you know, it'll be in our high schools, then our kindergartens, and before you know it, we have babies in thong underwear.
Is that what you want?
Yes, that's what I want.
Ladies and gentlemen, this vulgar sex show is over.
Please forget everything this horrible woman has told you.
It is not over.
It is far from over.
Andy, pack up our bananas!
This is a great idea.
Fresh air, no screens.
I'm getting really good at chopping wood too.
You're a regular Paul Bunyan.
Ow!
I got stung by the wood!
Oh, no, it's a splinter.
I need to get on webMD now!
I need a iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, something with 4G.
There's no time for the edge network.
What are you doing?
Wha--?
W-w-waa!
Got it.
I still think we should find a computer and Google "sterilization techniques".
Yeah, I have a new idea.
You need to purge all of this garbage from your system.
Talk about all the things you do on those screens, and let the words just float away into the fresh air, - and then we will be done.
- Okay, worth a shot.
Every day I start by hitting up Facebook, Twitter, tumblr, and Instagram.
Sometimes I like to throw in LinkedIn, for the professional shorties.
See?
That was easy.
Then I like to go on reddit.
Reddit's great, 'cause it has all the important links you need.
- New shirt?
- Yeah.
I got it at the dude ranch with my boyfriend.
- You like it?
- It's not my favorite shirt, but it is my least favorite shirt.
Perd, we strongly believe in teaching and practicing abstinence.
We all have some crazy urges from time to time, but you just can't act on them.
You have to bury them way down deep inside.
You have to say, "Get out of here, you crazy urges!
You are not welcome in this brain of mine"!
There are some statistics that I'd like to share with you now, and they are numbers.
Some 85% of Pawnee residents support abstinence-only education.
And the other 15% are perverts.
J.K., you guys.
And 100% of Pawneeans are "perd-verts".
That's the name I call fans of this show based on the fact that my name is Perd.
We'll see you after the break, perd-verts.
Look, we need an emergency task force meeting.
What do we do?
Objective studies have shown that abstinence-only education doesn't work.
People still have sex.
They don't know how to use protection, so the disease keeps spreading.
We need to give people practical knowledge.
Ann Perkins, your expertise is thrilling, and frankly, almost arousing, but the law is the law.
Well, you're on city council now.
- Change the law.
- The people support this.
I couldn't fight those numbers even if I wanted to.
It's political suicide.
So we're just gonna do the thing we know doesn't work?
- Great plan.
- There's no other option, Ann.
Put away your sex toys and play with them on your own time.
I did eat all the bananas, so you can't play with those.
Oh, hey, nice work on the jobs research.
Shh!
Look.
What am I looking at?
He's not doing anything.
That's the point.
This morning he got in, sat down in there, and has been staring straight ahead, doing nothing.
- He's a robot.
- He's not a robot.
He's just thinking.
He's got a lot on his mind.
Yeah, like, "One, one, zero, one.
Must eat babies for fuel".
Why would a robot need to consume organic matter?
Sorry.
You know what, they probably put a TV in there, and he's watching old speeches to bone up or something.
Let's go see.
Congressman, here is the briefing packet for our strategy meeting later.
Excellent, thank you.
Anything else I can do for you?
No, sir.
All systems are operational.
Great.
Stay cool.
Hot one out there today.
Thank you, congressman.
Wikipedia: Mankind's greatest invention/ you can learn about anything.
Take Ray J, for example.
We all know he's a singer, he's Brandy's brother, and he was in that classic sex tape with Kim Kardashian, but did you also know he's Snoop Dogg's cousin and he was in the '96 Tim Burton movie Mars Attacks?
Suddenly, you're on the Mars Attacks page.
I love GChat.
You can talk to anybody.
I hit up Brad.
Pitt.
It wasn't the actor.
It's actually a guy named Brad that's a teacher in Pittsburgh.
We don't have a lot in common, but we chat quite a bit.
"Emoji" are little cartoons you text instead of words.
Instead of saying, "What up, boo"?
You can type "What up," and then a cute, little ghost, 'cause that means "boo".
There's even a little Indian guy, but he has a turban on, which I think is racist, but the Asian guy also has a racist hat on, and it's like, "Hold up, didn't Japanese people invent this"?
Podcasts.
There are a million of 'em, and they're all amazing.
Jean-Ralphio and I have one called "Nacho average podcast," where we rate different kinds of nachos.
- It seems like-- - Okay, that's enough!
No more talking.
But you told me to get it all out of my system.
I had no idea how much you had in your system.
This is a real problem, tom.
You are an addict and you need to change.
I've downloaded every episode of Intervention.
I know what to do here.
You're right.
I am an addict.
I've hurt all my friends and family with my addiction.
I will accept this gift of rehabilitation.
I'm proud of you, but also a bit fearful that we're verging on what I call "feelings territory," so let's stare at the fire in silence.
I've had a breakthrough, Ron.
What do you say you chop up some more wood, and I'll take your car and go grab us some victory steaks?
Perfect.
I'm so glad you've come to your senses.
Here's our educational pamphlet.
I recommend you start reading at chapter three.
"Chapter three.
There's a party in your pants and no one is invited".
This is crazy.
I mean, obviously, the best way to prevent disease is to magically stop all sex, but that's not gonna happen.
Well, maybe not where you come from in "Tramp-sylvania".
Good one, honey!
I'm from Michigan!
That wasn't worth saying.
Why are you doing this?
You're gonna get up there and say a bunch of stuff you don't believe?
Well, it's the law.
I get that.
I just-- You're not acting like yourself.
Really?
You want to go there?
Go where?
You know where we're going.
No, I have no idea, honestly.
Okay, I guess we're going there.
Are we leaving?
You want me to act like myself?
You're dressed like a cowboy!
So?
It's fun, and I like it.
When you dated Andy, you dressed in flannels.
When you dated Chris, you dressed in spandex.
Ann, please do not lecture me about acting like myself.
You're dressed like an abstinence girl on the outside!
God, I'm off my comeback game right now.
You know what?
I don't care, do whatever you want.
Okay.
Girl, you look like Annie Oakley and Pippi Longstocking had a baby and I love it.
A deer jumped in front of the car, and then a bear jumped in front of the deer!
"'Tommy-edamame' is back on the grid.
"Tell everyone to light me up with their dijjies, gotta load 'em into my burner".
Yes, I went to best buy and bought a phone.
Out of the car, now.
Where are we going, Ron?
Are we walking to best buy to get a better phone?
I'm Marshall Langman and I'm here to say that sex before marriage is never the way I waited till marriage and then some to do it if you decide to sin, you'll rue it!
Word.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Thank you very much, Marshall.
Hello, my aged friends.
Some of you might remember that I was here before.
- I don't remember that.
- Well, I was.
But I have a new message for you.
The best way to be safe is to simply postpone sex until marriage.
I am not going to be told not to have sex by someone who's ten years my junior.
Amen, Gladys.
You're right!
Not about the age thing, about the other thing.
Perhaps you might understand it better if I read to you from this pamphlet, So you think you know more than God.
"Our bodies are God's gift, "but they're also the devil's playground.
"The devil likes to hide "in all your private nooks and crannies, "and if you open too wide, he might get out, or in".
What--?
Can we just see the condom demonstration again?
'Cause I don't know where Lou has been.
Well, I-I wish I-I could, but I-- Oh, screw it.
Okay, here.
This is a penis, right?
You put a condom on it, and you pull the tip like this, and you roll it all the way down the penis.
Tell you what, condoms for everybody!
Who wants some?
Safe sex for everybody!
- Hey!
- This is-- Hey, who wants to party?
It's a censure from the mayor's office.
It's so official.
I mean, look at the paper quality.
This is no joke.
I know I'm supposed to help educate the public, but I also have an obligation to uphold the laws.
You're my boss.
What's my move here?
Actually, Leslie, you're my boss now.
That's right.
Why am I still weirdly scared of you?
I'm very confident and I make a lot of eye contact.
Hmm.
As your city manager, I recommend that you formally apologize and that, in the future, you stick to the letter of the law, but between you and me, as your best friend - Wha--?
- I kind of admire what you did up there.
Made me happy that I voted for you as my city council member.
Okay, this is great, just make sure that you don't go too tight on him, all right?
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Mm.
What's the deal with the congressman?
Seriously, like, he seems a little robotic Or something?
Yeah, yeah, he's great, yeah.
He turns it on when he has to, and when he doesn't, he just sits there.
There's no surprises, it's perfect.
Oh, congressman, can you just sit in the chair to test the satellite feed?
Okey-dokey.
Just run through some of your stump speech.
We've gone through some difficult times, but we're from Ohio.
We're tough.
We won't just survive these dark times, we will thrive!
That's great.
Good.
Cool beans.
See you guys later.
God, I love him.
He's the best.
I'm sorry I crashed your car.
Please forgive me, Ron.
Please, Ron?
Please?
What are you doing?
Are you going to kill me?
Why do you need to be constantly distracted, tom?
The truth is I spend a lot of time looking at screens because recently, a lot of the stuff in my real life isn't going that great.
So I'd rather play Doodle Jump then think about that.
Okay?
I'm sorry, I really am.
Go sit in your office while I consider whether to turn you in to the judge.
And while you're there, neither doodle nor jump.
Hey.
I just wanted to come lend my support.
What are you going to say out there?
I don't know.
I got censured, it's a big deal.
Well, if you ask me, you were elected to lead and not to follow.
Which is probably what I should've said instead of what I did say.
I feel terrible about what I said too.
No, you were right.
I know, but I still feel terrible.
I'm sorry, continue.
I kind of lost myself in this relationship.
I bought a lasso online, Leslie.
Yikes.
I turned all my jeans into Daisy Dukes.
My personality kinda gets swept up in whatever guy I'm dating, and I want to change that.
I broke it off with Ricky.
Well, that's good, but I'll tell you, he'll never lasso another heifer as fine as you, Annie Oakley.
The story of that commercial break is it's over.
Leslie, what exactly does "censure" mean?
It means that I have been formally disciplined for breaking the law.
Well, you know what they say, "You break it, you buy it".
That doesn't really apply here.
Tell that to the folks at Pier 1, an establishment I'm no longer allowed inside.
Perd, I'd like to apologize.
Thank you.
Apologize for the antiquated laws in this city.
States that teach abstinence-only have the highest rates of teen pregnancy and STDs.
To continue this policy is insane.
Look, we all want the same thing, right?
We want fewer unwanted pregnancies and fewer STDs.
Why don't we use every weapon that we have?
I know that most of you don't agree with me on this, but I'm going to fight very hard to change your minds, and until then, I will take this censure, and I will wear it proudly, like a badge of honor.
Wow, strong words from a woman who is trying to pin a piece of paper to her blazer.
Next up on the program, we hear from you, our fans, in our new segment, "Are you there, perd-verts?
It's me, Perd, hosting a new segment".
I'm so bored.
I have something for you, son.
- My iPhone?
- No.
I am giving you a non-electronic book made of paper from a tree.
It is called Auto Repair Manual: 1982.
You will read this book from cover to cover, then you will assist me in repairing the damage to my car.
I will not report you to the judge, but if you slip up again, you will have much more to fear than some feeble government employee in a robe.
- Thanks.
- Two more things.
When you do get your phone back, you will not stare at it when you're talking with another human being.
Look a man in the eye when you speak with him.
And second, if you ever need to discuss your problems with someone find Leslie.
She lives for that crap.
Get to work.
They're killing me in the press.
The Pawnee Sun is calling me "Loose-ly Grope".
But you know what?
I don't even care.
I'm gonna kick all their asses!
I am so fired up!
I'm gonna go right now and drink, like, 1,000 Red Bulls so I can draft a new bill to undo abstinence-only.
Man, you are just a machine.
Get stuff done.
Hey, why don't you send it to me when you have a draft?
- I'll try to help.
- You're the greatest.
But you're gonna have to take out a lot of cursing, 'cause like I said, I am very fired up.
Well, you go get 'em.
I love you.
I love you too.
What are you wearing?
I can't do that right now.
- Yo, you ready to go?
- Why, yes, I am, April!
Let's go now!
What's wrong with you?
Wonderful!
Hey, be careful out there.
Traffic is nuts on the streets and roads.
Oh, no!
They got you!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ah, ha, ha.
Terrific!
Hey, I'm hungry.
Let's go eat some batteries-- I mean, human food.
Hey, uh, batteries-- I mean, human food sounds good to me.
Wonderful.
Let's go.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
- Hey.
- Hey.
Am I interrupting something important?
Impossible.
I work for the government.
I just picked up the girls, thought we'd stop by.
How are the girls-- Yes, they are.
Hello, girls.
Diane and I have been seeing a lot of each other, recently.
She is a sharp, confident, strong woman.
Her children are loud.
Kung fu!
Here comes trouble!
This is fun.
Easy, girls.
We'll be careful, Miss Lewis.
Ow!
I'm sorry.
I've got it.
We just wanted to invite you to come trick or treating tonight.
I think I'm a little old.
Can we go, Ron, please?
- Please?
- You can come, sure.
We have to go by 7:00 or else the good candy will be gone.
Sounds perfect.
Come on, girls.
Bye, guys!
See you later, Ron!
See you tonight!
What the hell just happened?
So, three bedrooms, two baths, nice big backyard.
But no trampoline room, correct?
Correct.
Like all houses in the world, - there's no trampoline room.
- Mm.
Ben is coming back from D.C. in ten days and he we are moving into a house together.
He would move into my place, but it's a scary nightmare hoarder nest.
His words.
And Ann's.
And the official report filed by the Health Department.
I'm just so happy that Ben and I are starting our life together and my future's finally back on track.
Martha, I wanna lease this house.
Great.
Thought it was gonna be more dramatic than that.
Hold on.
Okay, say it again.
Martha, I wanna lease this house.
Whoo!
Parks Department!
Chris Traeger, city manager, friend, aspiring life coach and recipient of Dr. Richard Nygard's award for Most Improved Patient for my psychotherapy sessions.
Wow, that's great, Chris.
Congrats.
Thanks, Jerry.
It's just a piece of paper and he only made it for me after I specifically asked for it while crying loudly, but It sure meant a lot to receive it.
In honor of Halloween, the city manager's office will be throwing a scary movie night in the courtyard.
Tonight's film is the 1986 horror camp classic, - - Murder At Blood Lake.
Seriously?
That's the best one!
I hope no one minds if I live tweet this bitch.
I am coming dressed as my greatest fear, because Dr. Richard Nygard feels that I should face my fears instead of running from them.
He's very wise.
I see him five times a week.
He holds my life in his hand like a fragile little bird.
See you tonight!
Well, Congressman Murray has an 18 point lead.
Calloway is out of money and has stopped campaigning.
So, congratulations!
- Great work, all of you!
- Yeah.
- But especially me!
- Especially everyone.
This was a team effort, really.
But I was the best.
Thank you.
You were all fantastic.
Most of all me, April Ludgate, the real hero.
Thank you and you're welcome.
Actually, April, if you want, you can head back to Pawnee early.
- Wrap a few things up and-- - Great.
Whoo!
That's an exit.
Gone, but never forgotten.
Who was that?
I'm just kidding.
Not bad, right?
You know, I have to say, Murray really came through-- Yeah, yeah, this one's over.
We won.
Great job.
Blah blah blah.
Let's talk about what you're gonna do next.
Oh, well, I was gonna get a chicken parm - and watch Bladerunner.
- Mm.
Oh, are you talking about, like, job-wise?
Yes, Ben, I am talking about, like, job-wise.
So you're a princess too, hey?
Oh, for the last four years everything has been princesses.
Every book, every movie, every backpack.
All princesses all the time.
- Oh, that sounds fun.
- It's a nightmare.
Excuse me, I just have to file a quick report.
I'm applying to the police academy soon and the manual says I have to work on my observation skills soTree, leaves, night, sky, hand.
Andy's hand.
Pfft.
What else you got?
Oh, no.
Vice principal emergency.
- What is it?
- I have to leave.
Some idiot kids were caught pooping on the soccer field?
Oh, too bad.
Guess trick or treating's over.
- No, Mommy, no!
- I'm sorry.
No, we can walk 'em around, it's no problem.
I mean, we just got started.
Oh, that's so sweet of you.
Now, ladies, Princess Mommy has to go take care of some bad guys, so you be nice to Ron and Andy, okay?
Okay, let's go to the next house.
I need to go to the bathroom.
I-I have no idea what to do about that.
Uh-oh.
It's the death canoe.
Get your foot out the water, dumb-ass!
It's blood lake.
Now, I missed the first three Death Canoe films.
Why exactly is it a death canoe?
- Does it tip over easily?
- Read my Twitter feed.
I live tweeted the first three this morning in preparation.
In the fifth one, the canoe's actually the hero.
It's a crazy twist.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You're the, uh-- - The lady and you're the-- - USA!
- Cool.
Great.
So hold on, what does this mean?
It means Jen wants me to keep working for her.
There's a businessman in Florida who wants to run for governor.
Florida?
They have sharks in Florida.
And swamps.
And swamp sharks.
Do you mean alligators?
Maybe.
Look, so are you gonna do it?
I--I mean, I just applied for a lease.
- We were supposed to-- - I know, and I know this makes the future a little murky, but right now everything's really preliminary, okay?
We'll know more in a week or so.
Trick or treat!
Man dressed as a nerd.
Female dressed as crazy witch.
Neither of us is in costume.
Case closed.
Candy, please.
Ron, Zoe broke my tiara!
We both have the same tiara.
Now she has one and I don't.
- Okay.
- I didn't mean to, Ivy!
Okay, well, let's just even things out.
There.
Now neither of you has a tiara.
Problem solved.
- Oh!
- Right in his face!
"Sorry about your jaw, son".
I mean, I just feel so powerless.
Just when things start to turn around and they fall apart.
Now I know exactly how FDR felt after Pearl Harbor.
Look, you guys have survived this long.
Please don't let this ruin your night.
Let's have fun.
It's Halloween.
You love Halloween.
Hey, I know what would cheer you up.
Let's go wait outside the bathroom for Tom and scare him.
That would cheer me up.
Okay.
Ready and Boo!
Jerry, God.
Gross.
Oh Jerry?
Guys, I-- Oh, God, I think he might be having a heart attack.
What?
Are you serious?
Ugh.
So much stuff is happening right now.
- Okay, call 911.
- Okay.
Just breathe, okay?
You're gonna be fine.
Oh, geez!
Did a dinosaur just fart?
Jerry, get a grip.
Sorry, guys.
Ugh!
Apology not accepted.
Stop talking, moron.
I wish I could stop smelling.
Dude.
Seriously, Jerry, did you eat farts for lunch?
Tom!
Jerry's having a heart attack.
Oh, no, I didn't know that.
Jerry, you okay?
Okay, I've got some magazines and those boring word jumbles you like to do.
Is there anything else you need, J?
Maybe some Gas-X?
Ha ha, Tom.
How is he, Ann?
Give it to me straight.
He's great.
He should be out of here in a day or two.
Doctor, medically speaking, how would you describe what happened to Jerry?
He had a mild heart attack.
Yeah, but he also exhibited excessive flatulence.
Is there a term for having a heart attack while releasing so much gas?
Not really.
Gastrointestinal distress is common during a cardiac event.
I just want to hear the doctor say that Jerry had a fart attack.
Is that too much to ask?
Thank you so much.
Look at all the balloons and the flowers and the food and-- my goodness, you're so sweet to come visit this often.
- Well, they did cause it.
- Hey.
No.
That's okay.
I'm glad this happened.
I mean, I could do without the mess of hospital bills, but no, this was a wakeup call.
I'm gonna make some changes.
I want at least another 30 years with Gayle and my girls.
Don't worry, Jerry, okay?
You are gonna have the future that you've always planned.
Just leave it to us.
Okay, so I have arranged for the Parks Department to throw a huge garage sale fundraiser for Jerry to help pay for his hospital bills.
The Pawnee municipal employee health care plan is kinda crappy.
One time I sprained my wrist and our insurance claimed that having a wrist was a pre-existing condition.
Babe, how much should I sell this hat for?
I don't know, eight cents?
Honey, this is the hat I was wearing the first time I ever heard Vitalogy by Pearl Jam.
Oh, $900.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Ron, you're not selling anything?
I am selling this table.
I made it.
So when am I gonna meet your new lover?
I'm afraid things have hit a rough patch with Diane.
She was not pleased with my babysitting performance and left me a very loud message on my cell phone.
I'm sure she'll get over it if you just say you're sorry though.
I like Diane, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for a whole family.
If the kids ever wanted to come to my place, I'd have to take a whole week off work just to undo the alarms and tripwires.
Hey, that's my name.
Yeah, that's my Chris Traeger box.
All these boxes represent stuff from different eras of ex-boyfriends.
OhHere are those ankle weights I bought you that you liked so much.
Recently Leslie pointed out that sometimes when I date someone, I kind of adopt that person's personality.
The evidence is fairly damning.
Chris Traeger-- exercise phase.
Andy Dwyer-- my grunge phase.
Tom Haverford-- my needless shopping phase.
Also my credit card debt phase.
Ann Perkins.
Thank you so much for coming.
Good afternoon.
As many of your know, Jerry Gergich, our friend, has suffered a devastating fart attack, and we are here to help.
So there are some special auction items I will be dealing with.
The first item up for bid is an inscribed autobiography from Pawnee newscaster Perd Hapley.
The book's entitled The Thing About Me Is I'm Perd Hapley.
Anyway, let's start the bidding at $20.
$20.
Thank you sir, for 20.
Do I see 30?
Mr. Kurtzwilder, it might be helpful if you told us why you want to be governor of Florida.
Well, I guess you could say mine is the classic Florida success story.
I went to SFU law school, I was working at a small firm in Orlando, and one day, bam, just like that, gator eats penis.
Excuse me?
Well, that was my first high profile case.
It was a classic Florida divorce.
Guy cheats on his wife with Dan Marino's masseuse, one day she cuts his junk off, throws it in the Everglades.
- Why not?
- Damn alligator ate it.
And that case, that case made my career.
Now, I just wanna give something back.
Frankly, your path to victory is narrow.
Governor Scott might be vulnerable, but you have very little name recognition.
But the Barkley Group is the best at what we do.
We're not in the business of losing elections.
We can get you where you wanna go.
I'm just saying, you should have put "spoiler alert" on all those Death Canoe tweets.
Also, not safe for work.
You know, a lot of what you wrote was really profane.
That movie's 25 years old, Morris.
And if you don't like how I tweet, don't follow me.
What are you doing now?
I'm talking to you.
I'm live tweeting this dumb-ass conversation.
- You like that coat?
- Yeah.
But $200?
It's used.
I paid 150 for it, then added the scorpion.
You can't sell clothes at a tag sale for more than they're worth.
Um, watch me.
Got a minute?
Sure.
I-I didn't expect to see you after theyelling that occurred.
Yeah, I was a bit stressed, but I'm not here to make excuses.
I just wanted to say that I am sorry for the way I reacted.
Apology accepted.
Do you wanna say anything to me?
Oh.
Yes.
You look nice today.
You broke my daughter's tiara.
You ruined their Halloween.
Don't you feel a little bit bad about that?
- Okay-- - Um.
Too late.
Good-bye.
Dude, you're totally blowing this.
I'm not gonna apologize.
It wasn't even a real tiara, for God's sake.
Oh, well, relationship over.
Too bad.
Oh, my God, you are so sad.
- I am not.
- Ron, she's right.
I've trained extensively in the art of observation.
You are sad, and we know why.
You didn't sell you table.
And it's probably a little too expensive.
Shh.
No.
Okay, this is our final auction item.
It's a one-of-a-kind autograph from mayor Gunderson's dog, Rufus.
Yeah, we need some big bids-- Oh, excuse me one second.
Um, can you--t--just--okay.
Hey, how was the meeting?
Kurtzwilder wants me to run his campaign from Florida.
I'm not exactly sure when the job would even starts, but it would probably mean putting our plans on hold.
Well, I mean, you know, obviously you gotta take it, right?
No, I mean, I'm not making any decisions until we talk about this and everything it would mean.
Look, I'm flying back to Washington.
I'll call you when I get there.
Okay?
Yeah, okay.
- Love ya.
- Love you, too.
$55.
Great.
Okay, come on, $60?
$65 anybody?
Hey, we're up to $60, not bad, right?
Yes, Ann, bad.
You might not care about Jerry's future, but I do.
Okay?
We need to do something very drastic so he can be happy, so we can all be happy.
Uh, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Don't know what you're thinking, but I'm definitely not thinking - what you're thinking.
- Good idea, Ann.
Okay, we have a new item up for bid.
A wonderful surprise item.
An evening with sexy nurse Ann Perkins.
- No.
- Yes.
Look at her, folks.
One evening with the most beautiful woman in the world.
Just dinner and dancing, nothing sexual.
Unless she's into that, but no, she's not.
Nothing fresh.
Don't even try it.
- But you never know, right?
- No!
No, she's not into it.
Don't try anything, but, you know, give it a shot.
Either way, it's for a good cause.
Let's raise some money.
Please, we need to do this for Jerry and his future.
This could be great, you know?
Three out of four married couples have met each other at spontaneous auctions.
I don't think that's true.
- I d--well, I don't know, I-- - $100.
All right, what the hell.
Okay, we have a $100 bid for Ann Perkins.
- 200.
- 200.
Thank you so much.
most accomplished woman I know.
And check out that bod.
Can I get 3?
$300.
Uh-oh.
- $600.
- 700.
- 750.
- $900.
Wow, 900 from the man with the tank top and the tattoos.
That's so great.
Let's beat that, shall we?
Who wants to beat it?
Anybody beat it please?
I'm sorry, I'm out.
I wouldn't sell her to that guy, though.
Just one man's opinion.
Okay Sir, what would you do with your $900 date?
How would you, uh, um What are you gonna do to her?
I don't know.
My cousin's got a kickass mud pit in his yard.
She could watch me do belly flops then we maybe we could get some Thai food and a tank of nitrous and see what happens.
Oh, that's not as bad as I thought it would be.
I am going to bid a million dollars on myself.
Going once, going never, sold.
Ladies and gentlemen, the auction closes in five minutes.
What up, playboy?
You like that jacket?
It's a pretty dope cut, right?
Yeah.
Can I have it, Mom?
I could wear it to homecoming.
you're just gonna grow out of in a month?
Forget it.
Wait, I can rent it to you.
Really?
Yeah, it's part of a business I run.
High end clothes rentals for teens, tweens and everything in betweens.
That jacket is 20 bucks a week.
Done.
This is a great idea.
He grows so fast I never wanna buy him anything nice.
What's the name of your business?
Rent-a-swag.
I'm sorry, Jerry, but your future has been canceled.
We only raised $1,200.
Leslie, thank you.
That is amazing.
No, it stinks.
It's not even close to what you need.
With all your bills, and the inevitable follow-up problems, and the lifetime of chronic misery that awaits you.
I mean, you had this whole plan for your retirement and your beach house and now you're future is just a huge pile of crap.
Leslie, you can't actually plan your future.
You know, there's no guarantees in this world.
As long as the people I love are a part of my life I will be just fine.
You wanna stick around?
Watch some of my stories with me?
Tonight's strawberry Jell-o night!
Oh, my God, your life is so depressing.
No thank you.
Never seen anyone more tortured over good news.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to seem ungrateful.
I just, you know, I have a lot to consider.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.
Feelings and girlfriend and whatever.
The point is just yesterday you said to me, "I'm never happier than when I'm managing a campaign".
I don't think I said that.
You didn't have to.
I watched you in Florida.
You were saying it with your heart.
Wow, you are really good at this.
Yes, I am.
I'm amazing.
But more importantly, so are you.
There aren't a lot of people that can manage a campaign.
But you, Ben Wyatt, are one of them.
So, just take tonight and just think about your future.
Hello, Diane.
I have brought you flowers.
Also chocolates.
And some grout cleaner.
I noticed you needed grout cleaner, so I brought that too.
Very romantic.
My kids are non-negotiable, Ron.
It's a package deal.
I know.
I'm sorry, Diane.
I really am.
I've been alone most of my life by choice and kids-- this is all new for me.
But I'd like to become familiar with it if you give me a chance to prove myself.
I did bring the girls something.
I thought I could teach 'em to saw.
I now realize that seems dangerous.
Well, my boyfriend might not be moving back for a while so I have to back out.
Just wanted to look at it one more time.
You know I can't give you your deposit back.
I know.
- And there's a $300-- - All right, Martha.
I get it.
Actually, is there a way I could put down, like a-- - Hey.
- Hey.
I didn't know you were coming back here.
- Oh.
- What are you doing?
Oh, my God, what are you doing?
I'm thinking about my future.
I am deeply, ridiculously in love with you and above everything else, I just-- I wanna be with you forever.
So, Leslie Knope, - will-- - Wait.
Wait.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Just--I need to remember this.
- Sure.
- Gimme a second.
- Okay.
- Leslie K-- - No, no, no, no, hold on.
Just--I need another second, please.
I need to remember every little thing about how perfect my life is right now at this exact moment.
Okay.
Are you good?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I'm good.
Leslie Knope, - will you-- - Yes!
- Marry me?
- Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Great.
Trick or treat!
It's November 8th.
Yes, well, these girls didn't get a chance to go trick or treating so somewhere in this house there is some candy.
Why don't you find it and we'll get right out of your hair.
All right, hold on one second.
- You having fun, ladies?
- Yeah!
All right, I got some, uh, calcium chews and, uh, a roll of cookie dough.
Okay, what do you say, girls?
Thank you!
Tremendous.
Appreciate it.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
It's so beautiful - and sparkly.
- I know.
And it's a nonconflict diamond.
When Andy proposed to me, he gave me a ring pop, but then he ate it first.
How did Ben do it?
Let me start from the beginning.
- Uh-oh.
- In 1832, Ben's great-great-great-great- grandfather, Teodore Wyatt, a bastard, met a beautiful seamstress from Antwerp.
Ben and I are getting married, and I've been telling everybody about it.
I'm so happy, I want to shout it from the rooftops.
And she has.
We've gotten several noise complaints.
- We're getting married!
- All right.
Mm, the joy that I am feeling right now is profound and unmatched in the modern era.
And I can't tell you what it means to me that I'm the very first person that you chose to tell.
Oh-- Let me walk around with you as you tell everyone else so that I can share true joy being spread, please?
Hey, everyone!
We have something very exciting to tell you that you have never heard before.
- Ben and I are engaged - What?
And you're hearing about it for the very first time right now.
Come on, everybody!
How about a little excitement?
Leslie and Ben are engaged!
Nothing will ever come between them!
Leslie and Ben are-- What's going on?
Leslie and Ben are engaged!
Again?
- You guys!
- Oh.
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah!
Aah!
- Okay, T-minus six hours until the engagement party.
Has you-know-who responded yet?
Surprisingly, no, Larry Bird has not RSVP'd yet.
Well, he kind of waits until the last minute.
That's his style.
Put him down as a "maybe".
- Are you excited?
- Yeah, totally.
I-I just have two small requests.
One, put Twizzlers on the candy table, and two, cancel the party because you invited my parents, and they can't be in the same room together.
Okay?
Great, thank you.
No to canceling the party, and no to Twizzlers.
We are a Red Vines family.
You're gonna have to get used to that.
I know you're scared, but I love you, and this party is gonna go great.
Well, if there's anyone who can bring my parents together, it's no one.
No one can ever bring them together.
My family situation is complicated.
My parents got divorced and they hate each other.
Okay, I guess it's not that complicated.
Okay!
You guys pretend you're Ron Swanson, and you're trying to decide whether you want to invest in this company.
Be super critical.
You're short.
And herewego!
Tom Haverford and Jean-Ralphio Saperstein Creators of Entertainment 720 Proudly present - Rent A Swag!
- Wah!
Parents, are you tired of watching your middle-school-aged children grow out of the nice clothes you buy for them?
Then rent them!
From Rent A Swag.
I own it.
You rent it.
You wear it.
You clean it.
You return it.
I get rich.
Wink!
Rent A Swag!
Where your swag is my business!
Okay, stop.
You guys, stop!
Stop!
And your business is my swag Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Please..
There's actually a lot more, but tell us your thoughts so far.
It's the greatest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
- Yes!
- No!
It's terrible.
It's terrible, you guys.
I love you, baby.
You're so smart.
You're presenting this to Ron Swanson.
Don't talk about any of your old, failed businesses, get rid of that stupid light show, and definitely don't use any weird, made-up words that Ron doesn't understand.
But the presentation's tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. We don't have time to start from scratch.
Well, if you do any of that, he's not gonna invest, so Your funeral.
Hey!
I'm glad you're here.
Let's go over the plan.
Okay, you and I go stargazing in Harvey James park, while my parents slowly strangle each other in the living room.
- No.
Your mom arrives at 7:00.
We hand her a glass of chilled white wine, and, oh, look, my mom is walking over, and they're both educators and mothers.
What a fabulous coincidence.
Then later, Stephen Wyatt shows up--that's your dad.
Yes.
He's terrifying.
We make some small talk, and 30 minutes later, I show everybody the big surprise.
The Knope-Wyatt unity quilt.
Ben and I are weaving our lives together, so I have woven this quilt.
It represents every member of our new united family.
Of all my metaphorical art projects, this is by far the coziest.
- This is amazing.
- I know.
I worked really hard on it.
And, out of respect, I did not include any images of the only other man in the world who's as sexy as you, Joe Biden.
- Yes, you did, right there.
- Hmm?
Oh, well, that's just a little one.
The point is, this quilt is going to unite the Wyatt clan.
It's beautiful, and it won't.
Everyone, before everyone else gets here, I'd like to make a little toast.
My romantic life has been a bit of a mixed bag lately.
And when that's the case, it's hard not to be cynical about love and relationships, but it's couples like you that give hope to the rest of us.
Leslie, you deserve the best, and you found it.
Ben, don't you dare hurt her.
I won't.
Don't laugh.
She means it.
Okay, I-I won't.
Seriously, son, don't hurt her.
Okay, I'm not planning on hurting her.
- You better not be.
- I'm not!
Hey, Ben, you best watch yourself.
Why would any of you think I would hurt Leslie?
You're all my friends too.
Nah.
This was literally the most beautiful and moving thing that I have ever heard.
There, there, baby boy.
Take all the time you need.
Well, sure, in a wrestling match, Kirk would win.
But overall, who would you rather have at the helm of your Sovereign-class starship?
Jean-Luc Picard.
No contest.
Hey, your mom's here.
I need you.
Thank God.
- There's my boy!
- Hey, Mom.
Nice to see you.
This is Leslie Knope, my fiancee.
Hi.
It's--it's really nice to finally meet you, Ms. Wyatt.
Oh!
Please call me Julia.
Is your father here yet?
- No fighting tonight, Mom.
- Don't worry!
I'm going to be civil, as long as he is.
Frankly, after what he did at Geoffrey's graduation-- Oh, I have some white wine for you, some Chardonnay.
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.
Right this way.
- Hey, you guys, come on in.
- Thank you.
Ann.
Hey.
You all right, man?
The toast that you gave to Ben and Leslie was so beautiful, and I'm feeling very raw from my therapy.
I am so happy And so sad.
It's like a perfect storm of emotions.
And so I'm hiding out here, so I don't ruin this party for my two amazing best friends who I love so much.
Oh!
There's no more tissue.
- Everything ends!
- No, no, no.
No, there's more tissue.
- There's-- - Everything goes away.
And I said, rules or no rules, I just have to kiss that beautiful face.
Well, that's a Knope woman for you.
When we see something adorable, we attack it.
He is adorable, isn't he?
You chose well, Benny.
Aw, thank you.
So far, so good.
I'll admit it.
Things are going surprisingly well.
Yeah.
And pack it up.
It's over, we're screwed.
He brought his girlfriend?
He wasn't supposed to bring his girlfriend, Ben.
Oh, Ben!
Your father brought his little plaything.
- Hiya, Benny.
- Hey, Dad, hi.
Hi.
Unh.
Hi, Ulani.
Thought you weren't coming.
Ulani is my girlfriend, and she's important to me, and I need her here.
Ulani, hi, I'm Leslie.
What a wonderful surprise.
We're so happy that you're here.
What the hell, Steve?
They didn't know I was coming?
We didn't know it was spring break.
Okay, thanks, everybody, for coming.
I'm so sorry you all have to go home.
Hey, Red Vines anyone?
We're a Twizzlers family.
Okay, we are off to a rocky start, but we are gonna fix this.
Yes, we will.
I called a cab.
It's outside.
I gave the driver 100 bucks to sit and wait, so whenever we're ready to go-- like, maybe right now-- all we have to do is walk outside.
No, I want to be here now, with you and your parents.
Help me make this work.
Okay, fine.
Best thing to do is distract them with innocuous talk - about the stuff they care about.
- Great, like what?
Well, they're white people from Minnesota, so hockey, fishing, skiing, sailing, and after a few drinks, put on a Prince album.
Don't mention the Green Bay Packers or the state of Iowa.
And also, I have enough frequent flyer miles to get us to Australia tonight.
- Everything okay?
- Uh, slight speed bump.
Everything is terrible, but I am going to fix it with my secret weapon.
Okay, well I will make sure that everything else runs smoothly.
Ann, you are such a good friend.
You are a beautiful, talented, brilliant, powerful musk ox.
Thank you, ox, for keeping this ship afloat.
You got it.
Guys, I need your help, okay?
Chris is in the back room, and he's crying.
Go in there, calm him down, make him feel better.
Leslie and Ben have enough to deal with, okay?
Thank you.
Wait, why is Chris crying?
- Uh, he's emotional.
- Wait, why is Chris emotional?
Because he's in therapy right now, and it's dredging up a lot of stuff for him.
Wait, wait, like what kind of stuff?
Like, I don't know, his friends are getting married, and he's not dating anyone.
Why isn't he dating anyone?
Yeah, why don't you date him?
Because I'm dating myself right now, okay?
I'm--I'm trying to figure out how to make me happy.
Ugh, why is it always about you, Ann?
Self-centered much?
Just go, okay?
Thank you.
- Ron in 60 seconds.
- Tom.
I haven't seen you tonight.
I've been working on my presentation.
I just came by to congratulate Leslie, and then I'm heading back.
I admire the work ethic.
I'm always looking for new investments.
Ever since I got my first job at the age of nine, I have put all my money into gold, which is currently at an all-time high.
So I have a certain amount of money.
I've said too much.
Looking forward to tomorrow.
Yes About that.
I was wondering, is there any chance we could reschedule?
I just want to make sure everything is up to my world-class "standees".
I like to keep my appointments, son, and I like others to do the same.
Of course, yes.
No problem, 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.
I think you're gonna be very impressed with our presentation.
"Our presentation"?
Who else is joining you?
Ricka ricka ricka ricka!
Swanson.
- Jean-Ralphio.
- That's me.
I didn't realize you were a part of this.
Of course he is.
He's my business partner.
Shh!
Clean!
Business partner, now and forever.
Hold up!
Forever 21.
Salute your shorts.
Kaboosh!
I just free-associated all over the "mousse-tache".
That's just one of many skills he brings to this business partnership.
What are those, shrimp?
Ah!
Okay.
Rethink that move, son.
Let's just drive back.
I feel weird.
Steve, you like sailing, right?
Not any more, since Julia got the boat in the divorce and then sold it to a scrapyard because she's terrible.
Well, at least you don't have to deal with all that boat upkeep now, right, huh?
Yech, no thankee.
Let's talk about something other than sailing.
Why don't you head in the other room?
I have a surprise that-- there she goes.
There's a surprise for you, so, um, head on in.
I don't like surprises.
Okay, look, you gave it a try, but this quilt thing is not going to work.
Ben, on three separate occasions, I have used a quilt to mend fences.
In ninth grade, a quilt ended an argument between my two best friends, and a quilt settled the Donna-Jerry parking lot feud of 2006.
What was the third time?
Right  now.
Okay, I still don't think it's gonna work, but I am really attracted to you right now.
I know.
Let's do this.
Police, open up!
We have a warrant!
Just kidding, it's us.
- Ha, we got you!
- Andy and April.
We have someone who wants to see you!
Champion!
Come here.
Hey, big boy.
You are such a brave, good dog, with so much spirit.
You've overcome so much.
You are the most wonderful dog in the whole world.
And I am so happy for you.
Okay, everyone, I have a surprise for all of you.
Voila!
The Knope-Wyatt unity quilt!
It represents our two families coming together, and there is a personalized square for each member of our joint family, see?
- Sweetheart, this is lovely.
- Thanks, Mom.
Where's my square?
Well, you're not technically-- - Not technically what?
- Not technically an adult.
This is a very thoughtless omission, Leslie, and as far as I'm concerned, if there's no Ulani square, this is not a legitimate unity quilt.
- Oh, that old Chestnut.
- Okay.
I will make an Ulani square.
Very, very easy.
Okay.
Look, this is your square now.
What does "Ulani" mean?
"Cheerful".
Sure.
All right.
Look at that.
Unity!
It's that simple.
All we had to do was-- I don't want her name on my quilt.
It's not your-- it's everyone's quilt.
It's a unity quilt.
I think it's mean that you didn't do a square for me.
It's a disaster is what it is.
You can say that again, Steve.
See, Ben, they're agreeing.
It's working.
Okay, I'm thinking we junk everything except the mannequins.
Ron's gotta see how dope the outfits are.
That's the business.
Why are we going to Ron?
Ron should be coming to us!
We created Entertainment 720.
Which was a huge failure.
I don't know-- Look, a bank's not gonna give us a loan, and Ron loves my entrepreneurial spirit.
Trust me, he's our best chance at getting start-up money.
I hear that.
Let's go clubbing.
No, we gotta work.
Didn't you hear me say we gotta junk most of the presentation?
Tommy, I will always be there for you, no matter what, but right now, I cannot be there for you because I have to go.
I hate to say this, but Sometimes you've gotta work a little, so you can ball a lot.
That was beautiful.
That changed me.
I'll give you ten minutes.
You have to try to eat something, okay?
Mmm!
Wow, that's amazing.
See?
There you go.
This one's not as good.
All right, Chris, here's the plan.
I'm just gonna list off happy things until you're cheered up.
Pizza, the beach, rock and roll music-- - and I'll list terrible things to bring you back down.
Smallpox, botched surgery, snails crawling out of your mouth.
This is weirdly working.
It's evening me out.
- Okay, keep going, keep going.
- Laughter.
Snails crawling out of your mouth.
- The beach.
- Snails crawling out - out of your mouth.
- Cute cats.
Snails crawling out of your butt.
Dave Matthews Band.
Dave Matthews Band.
Look, Dad, Leslie worked really hard on this, so can you just cool it for, like, 30 seconds?
Sure, I can.
But your mother can't.
See?
She's ruining your quilt, just like she ruined our marriage!
Mom!
Oh, I didn't know we could cut that.
It had to be done, Ben.
It absolutely did not have to be done.
Look, champagne!
Yeah, why don't we just forget about the quilt - and just raise a glass?
- Yes!
Toasts are fun.
They usually signify the end of a party.
Here you are, Ulani.
I'm good, thanks.
Oh, by all means, go ahead and take it, Ulani.
Or, wait, are you even old enough to drink?
Yes, Julia, I am, but I can't because I'm pregnant.
You're what?
Oh, boy.
I didn't mean to steal your spotlight, but the cat's out of the bag.
Young Ben is going to have a new baby sister, huh?
Still firing bullets, son.
I cannot be in the same room as him.
What about the wedding?
I'm talking about the wedding.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Wyatt family.
It's like the war of the Wyatts out there!
- I mean, it's so brutal!
- Oh, my God.
Were you and Dad ever like that?
Well, like any married couple, honey, your father and I fought occasionally, and sometimes he won the argument, and sometimes I won.
But usually, we forgot what we were arguing about and just had sex.
- La la la la la.
- Anyway, the important thing is that we always ended up on the same team.
And in the same bed.
God, I miss that man.
How can you be so wise and so inappropriate at the same time?
I'm a parent.
I can't figure out how to phrase this mission statement.
Let me get a shot at it.
I'm actually pretty good at this stuff.
See?
You just googled, "Amanda Bynes side boob".
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
Why is your safesearch on?
That is amateur hour, Tom.
Listen, we've been at this for an entire evening.
I say, why don't we cut our losses?
If it was such a good idea, we would be millionaires by now.
Hello.
Look, man, I believe in this idea.
Do you?
You know I love you, but I don't think you're as serious about this business as I am.
Oh, yeah, no, I'm definitely not.
Hey, I got your text.
What are you doing?
I grabbed all of the brownies from the dessert table and four bottles of wine.
Get in the car.
We're going to Australia.
- Leslie-- - I am so sorry for everything.
I love you, and I want to be on your team.
I am on your team, but I think that our team should be far away from here.
Normally, I would get in the cab with you, but I am so sick of them ruining everything, and I really liked that unity quilt.
- It was a good quilt.
- It was an awesome quilt.
Look, my parents are insane, but they need to be at our wedding.
You know what?
It's time for this team - to come up with a new plan.
- I agree.
Phase one of our new plan, you get in the backseat of this cab, and we hardcore make out for 15 minutes.
I would love to do that.
I'm just not sure if the driver would be okay with it.
For another 100 bucks, you can do whatever you want.
Let's do this.
Swan song!
What up, my man?
- Ow, are you kidding me?
- Jean-Ralphio.
I thought you and Tom were working on your presentation.
No, I decided it was best if I took my talents elsewhere.
- Do you know what I mean?
- You abandoned your friend?
God, no.
He fired me, straight up.
Talked about how I wasn't serious enough about the project, how he needed to grow up.
Anyway, I have an amazing investment idea for you.
Condoms with pictures on them.
- Pass.
- Good.
Smart.
I think you made the right decision.
Take care.
Oh.
Chris?
Seems like the storm has passed.
Indeed it has.
I can't believe that I spent the entire party in a room being happy-sad on a night that means so much to my two best friends.
I mean, you're going through a lot.
You need to purge all this stuff that's been building up.
This lesbian nurse is right, Chris.
You can't keep it all bottled up.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe all of my emotions tumbling out like this means that I can get a clean start.
Well, for that, you're gonna have to visit the bathroom first.
- Right?
- No.
- Ann Perkins!
- Nope.
You are, without a doubt, the queen of toilet humor.
That's all I ever wanted to be.
This was supposed to be a happy occasion.
You were supposed to come here, celebrate your son's engagement, maybe bury the ax?
And not in each other's back.
But it did not work out that way.
So here is the new plan.
I don't expect you to like each other, but you have to come to the wedding, okay?
We'll seat you far away from each other.
You don't even have to socialize.
Yeah, in fact, we insist that you don't.
But you do have to show up and tell us that you had a great time.
That's the deal.
You can either take it, or you can take it.
I can take it.
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too, Benny.
- Sorry.
Whatever.
Aw, what a beautiful apology.
- Julia - Guys.
Sorry.
Ben's parents are insane, but he is not.
He's amazing.
And that's all that matters.
I guess he might become insane as he ages.
I should keep an eye out for that.
Also, for the record, my unity quilt worked.
So technically, I am three for three with unity quilts.
We only have Let's go.
Oh, okay.
Get ready, driver.
We're gonna make out so hard in the back of your cab.
Are you okay, son?
Did you get any sleep?
Uh, not really.
I stayed up most of the night.
But that's not important.
Let me tell you about Rent A Swag.
- Now-- - No need, Tom.
I'm in.
I like doing business with serious people, and when you removed yourself from the company of that moron, you showed me you're a serious person.
- You have your start-up money.
- Wow.
I appreciate it.
Tommy "T"!
You just missed the craziest of crazies.
Clubs.
Girls.
Dancing.
Naked.
Mom?
Argument.
Police.
Fleeing the scene.
Hiding in a Dumpster.
Coming here.
Crashing on your couch for a week 'cause technically, I'm homeless Hey, "mousse-tache".
I'ma hit the couch.
You know where I be.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Uh that's a stretch.
Fine.
I win, we move in there.
I'll take the West Wing.
You take the East Wing.
You can be the first gentleman.
Actually, that sounds kind of great.
Thanks for coming with me to get my stuff.
How could I pass up an opportunity to look at our future house?
Oh, just remembered.
I kind of got you an engagement present.
Is it a waffle tower?
I mean, it's a little better than that.
Claudia Welders.
Uh, that-- how did-- - How did you do this?
- Called in a few favors.
Excuse me.
A few hundred favors.
Mr. Vice President.
Ben Wyatt from congressman Murray's office.
Hey, Ben.
Dave told me yowewere gonna be coming by.
And you must be Leslie Knope.
Welcome.
Welcome.
You're--my name just came out of your mouth.
Well, yeah, it did.
This isn't happening.
This isn't real.
No, it's happening, and I'm delighted to have you here.
On behalf of the president and myself, - I wanted to-- - Oh, Mr. vice president, I am deeply flattered, but there's no way that I could take over Madam Secretary Clinton's position.
- I mean-- - I'm confident you could do that job or any other, but-- - Okay, I will.
Well, the reason you're here is I'm told you've done such a great job in your town and in the state of Indiana, and I just want to say congratulations for your public service.
And I just want to say thank you.
Well, you-- you're very welcome.
You're very welcome.
Hey-- y-you're very welcome.
- You're very handsome.
- I think we're all done.
- Well, you're very nice.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Thank-- thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Well-- Oh, well, you will?
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
Y-you're welcome.
You don't let anything happen to him, you understand me?
He is precious cargo.
Yeah, it's actually the same accounting firm I almost joined last year, and they gave me a great package-- Three weeks of vacation, matching 401, and a pretty sweet windbreaker.
- Wow.
- I'm getting married, and I wanted a good stable job, so I'm going back to Accounting.
So just call me Bond, municipal bond.
Yeah, that joke killed at the accounting firm.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Mr. Looks and Professor Books.
He's Looks.
I got it.
Of course you do, Books.
What's going on?
Well, fun fact: Ben just got an amazing accounting job.
Regular fact: I have to go to a meeting.
Un-fun fact: My Uncle just had a stroke.
Well, I'm off.
This is actually a crazy coincidence.
I have a new company and could use your help on the math side of things.
- Oh, what's the new company?
- We specialize in making stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks.
Right.
Pass.
I'm kidding.
It's a real idea.
So get this-- Kids are always growing out of their clothes, so their parents don't want to buy 'em nice things.
I'm gonna rent my upscale clothing to middle school kids, because I discovered I'm roughly the same size as the average Pawnee 12-year-old.
That's actually a really great idea.
I know.
Can you take a look at the business plan, tell me what do you think?
- Sure.
Why not?
- Awesome.
Washington, D.C. has more dog parks per capita than most cities.
Pawnee only has two dog parks-- this one and that one, which is also an active parking lot.
Can you say "per capita" again?
I want to take a picture of you saying "per capita".
- Stop.
- I am so proud of you.
Now stand next to the screen and think about all the strong female role models in your life.
- Gross.
- April came to me with an idea to build a dog park in Pawnee.
I recognized her potential a long time ago, and she's finally living up to it.
I mean, I am so proud of her, I could cry.
And here we go.
One tiny critique.
If you do want to be taken seriously, you might want to think a little bit about how you present yourself.
No, this is publicity for Orin's new performance art show.
He's an animal living on a human farm.
And you can go and feed him from your own hand.
Ugh, that's horrifying, and so is Orin.
You should not be friends with him.
So, after reviewing all the options, I found that the best location for the dog park is Lot 48, the one behind Ann's house.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I've been trying to put a park there for four years.
See, the thing is, April, that lot is mine.
I've been doing slow, painstaking work so I don't want to whip out the legalese on you now, but I got dibs.
What we are gonna do is we're gonna take your enthusiasm, we're gonna bundle it up, and we're gonna find a new place for a dog park.
Doesn't that sound fun?
One, two, three, cheese.
Good girl.
Good morning, Andy.
Okay, something is different about my computer.
Aha.
It's gone.
A game is the foot.
See, part of the police academy entrance exam is investigating a crime.
So about a month ago I told everyone in the office that, at some point, they should steal something from my desk so I could practice.
Let's do this.
Wait, hey, did you guys take my glasses too?
They got my sunglasses too.
I was in Miami last weekend.
I took my talents to South Beach.
How do you spend your time in Miami?
Maybe fencing stolen computers?
Yes, I took your government computer from Indiana to Miami to sell it on the black market for 150 bucks.
Ha-ha, you don't know it, but you just gave yourself away.
Gotta say, I'm impressed.
Your mission statement made sense, and you didn't use one R. Kelly lyric.
Yes.
So you want to be my CFO?
Well, I already have a job, but I'll help as a friend.
As long as you take what I say seriously.
I don't want another Entertainment 720 disaster on our hands.
Yeah, it was a disaster.
Too bad we didn't see it coming.
All right, what's my first move?
You know, I think any of the four previous locations would work, but there's something about this place.
It just has a really good energy here, you know?
lots of natural light.
It's tiny and awful and loud.
And it's zone 14B, industrial waste clean-up site.
We should technically be wearing Hazmat suits right now.
It seems like the kind of place a ska band would go to shoot heroin.
Come on, guys, this is a great place for a dog park.
I mean, look, there's already a dog here.
Oh, my God.
I had that exact doll when I was a kid.
This is-- this is traumatic for me.
Well, I'm sorry, but lot 48 is the only one that works.
And I'm definitely bringing it up at the next city council meeting.
April, please, I beg of you, I will do anything to keep you from doing that.
Okay.
Saw off your pinky toe.
- No.
- Shave your head.
- No.
- Have sex with Jerry.
No.
Well, I tried to be reasonable.
I have created a monster.
And now I need to destroy her.
What do I do, Joe?
Well, Leslie, look into my eyes, take a deep breath, and everything will be fine.
Thanks, Joe.
God, he's good.
Ron, thank you for agreeing to see me.
I didn't.
You just walked in here and started talking.
I don't have time for a history lesson.
Look, I am trying to remove parking meters, and there is a guy in Public Works who's being a real thorn about it.
- Which guy?
- Ricky Jordache.
Never heard of him.
What's his deal?
He's new.
He used to be a slacker, but now he's realizing his full potential, but at what cost?
He's smart, and he's beautiful, and I think of him in many ways as a daughter, but that would be crazy 'cause he's a man and his name's Ricky.
Here's my question.
How did you used to slow me down when I was becoming too me-ish?
Sometimes I'd just give you busy work.
I once had you put together a brochure about different kinds of Indiana topsoil.
That soil brochure was not busy work.
I mean, people still refer to Mulch Ado About Nothing.
And if you were particularly amped up about a project, I'd take you to JJ's and distract you with waffles.
Those were distraction waffles?
I thought they were friendship waffles.
Breakfast food can serve many purposes.
But what if this person, this Ricky, who is real, doesn't like waffles or anything.
Everybody has something they're passionate about.
Just figure out what it is, express an interest in it, and divert his attention.
Howdy, neighbors.
Welcome to human farm.
Here's your animal feed.
Please don't feed the animals.
Wow, this is really, really cool.
I like the statement it's making that, you know, we're all in cages in a way.
Yeah, it's actually about death and the city.
Yeah.
I see that now.
Hi, Orin.
Ms. Wicks, if you've read our proposal, you'll see that an alliance between Rent-A-Swag and Sweetums could be mutually beneficial.
Well, I must say it's a much better idea than the last one you had, that gourmet French food thing.
Oh, my escargot delivery service, Snail Mail.
So you want to partner up and make history?
I mean, you've already made history as the world's most beautiful CEO.
I'm really sorry, cutie.
The company's laying low right now due to a small mishap.
Ah, yes.
The Sweetums molasses storage vat exploded, resulting in a slow-moving ecological disaster.
Well, all press is good press.
No, this was bad press.
A lot of homes were very gradually flooded.
People died.
Actually, speaking of, we're starting up a non-profit foundation to restore our name.
Any interest in running it?
Oh, I'm--I'm sorry, you want me to run your non-profit wing?
I know that Bobby Newport is my stepson, but the work you did on Leslie's campaign was amazing.
Your name is on our short list.
Just to clarify, it's a no to me on all fronts, and you're offering Ben a job?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
Cool.
Been looking at your file all day, Jerry-- if that even is your real name.
It's not.
My real name is Gary.
Well, Gary--if that even is your real name-- Somebody stole my computer.
Now, if you're a criminal, look at me, you have to tell me legally, or else it's considered entrapment.
I'm sorry, Andy.
It wasn't me.
Oh, man, really?
- No.
- Okay.
Okay, so we know it's not Jerry, unless he was lying to me.
I can never tell when people are lying to me.
Hopefully that doesn't come up in my police work.
I think we should do more stuff like this.
You know, I think Pawnee needs an amazing arts program.
Maybe you should just drop everything and coordinate it.
I'm not stupid.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means that the only reason you brought me here is to distract me from the dog park.
- You hate this show.
- I love this show.
- What's your favorite part?
- The heavy-handedness.
You know what, I have to go talk to Councilman Jamm right now.
Why are you talking to Councilman Jamm?
Because I told him about the dog park idea, and he loves it.
He thinks it's a great idea.
He's gonna support my motion at the city council meeting tomorrow, and he gave me a really cool dental mirror to check out my molars.
Our dispute aside, you should be careful with Jamm.
He's a snake, I'm telling you.
Yeah, like I should trust you out of all people right now.
Moo.
- Moo.
- Quiet, weirdo.
Aren't you supposed to be a sheep?
No.
You are.
Oh, shut up.
Tom would make a great profile for your show.
I mean, this is a guy who's learned through an unbelievable series of bonehead business moves.
Not to mention in the last month alone three people have confused me for a shorter, Indian Ryan Gosling.
It's interesting, but I think I need to wait until the business has been around for a few months, make sure it's viable.
You're the guy who ran the congressional campaign - in Washington, right?
- Yeah.
What, are you gonna offer him a job?
Yes.
We're launching a new political chat show, and we need correspondents.
Oh, well, thank you, but I'm a little shaky on live TV.
That's okay.
People want authenticity.
- Think about it?
- Didn't you hear him?
He stinks on TV.
He sweats.
He stutters.
It's like The King's Speech, but the first part, before he's fixed.
That was my favorite part of the movie.
What is happening?
Chris Traeger.
Yup.
Hi, Andy.
I know you did it.
Did what?
Don't play stupid and handsome with me.
You stole my computer so that I could practice for my police exam.
You're as guilty as you are sexy.
Andy, another computer was reported stolen from the offices on the other side of the courtyard.
I don't think this is part of your police training.
I think City Hall was robbed.
I can't tell if you're lying to me.
- Really?
- I think.
Like a real crime?
That's even better.
Next order of business: It's agenda item 280B, a motion to construct a dog park on municipal lot 48.
Ms. Ludgate, you have the floor.
Thank you, Councilman Jamm.
Your help and general non-awfulness is much appreciated.
Leslie, members of the Council, I believe that municipal lot 48 should be a dog park.
Boo.
Boo.
Well, it sounds like there's considerable opposition to this, so I'm sorry, Ms. Ludgate, you should go now.
Really?
I just heard one hag booing.
Ladies, please, let's keep this civil.
Councilman, Pawneeans, satisfied customers of Jamm Orthodontics, as we discuss what type of park to put on lot 48, I had a thought.
How about no park?
Who here thinks parks are stupid?
Let the record show that everyone is raising their hands.
I happen to know for a fact that Pawnee's favorite fast food restaurant, Paunch Burger, needs a new location.
Now, seeing as how the future of lot 48 is open for debate, I move we sell it to Paunch Burger for a nice profit.
You don't even have to be Asian to do math that simple.
You told me you wanted a dog park.
Uh, psych.
That's not fair.
You lied to me.
You just got jammed.
I hate when he says that.
I told you that Jamm was a snake.
Well, it takes a snake to know a snake.
- So now I'm a snake?
- Yes.
You deceived me for two straight days, and you eat mice.
- I don't eat mice.
- Yes, you do.
You're a mouse eater.
Mouse eater.
- Mouse eater.
- Enough!
You are friends and coworkers.
In this office, we treat each other with respect.
Hey, April, how is that dog park coming?
- Get out, Jerry.
- This is private!
Sorry, guys.
We are not leaving here until you two figure this out.
Ron, guard the door.
Yes, sir.
No one leaves the Octagon.
I dated an ultimate fighter.
It was like a thing he said.
What's the play here, officer?
You gonna set up a perimeter, maybe bug a few phones?
Ooh, I know.
We could put out a dummy computer for them to steal, fill it with explosives first, Boom, take 'em all out.
Yeah, we're not doing any of that.
Andy, I love your enthusiasm, but we don't really have the kind of money to launch a massive investigation.
You're just gonna fill out this stupid report and that's it?
As a future cop, you have to understand, I cannot let this guy go.
Look, man, this is what most police work is.
Just writing stuff down.
It's not superhero time.
If it sounds boring, maybe you ought to do something else.
Maybe we should find the person who stole his positive attitude.
Hey, man.
Hey, man.
Get any more job offers since I last saw you?
Yeah, but it was just a management position at Urban Outfitters.
I turned it down.
I don't know, man.
Maybe I can't hack this.
Maybe I should take a cue from you and stick with my boring day job.
Well, my accounting job isn't boring.
If it was remotely interesting, there would be a show on A&E about it.
They have a show about storage unit auctions.
Fair point.
Look, if you're passionate about this, keep at it.
Things will turn around.
Also can you tell me what time that show about storage units is on?
All right, I'm gonna have to force this.
Leslie, maybe you want to admit that you haven't been the greatest role model.
I don't care.
Orin's my role model.
April, maybe you want to admit that you've been a little selfish and inconsiderate.
Look, all I ever wanted was for you to show the enthusiasm you showed for your dog park, and, when you did, I blew it.
- And I'm sorry.
- Fine.
I'm sorry that I outsmarted you at every turn.
- April.
- And I know I have a lot to learn from you, and I'm sorry that I disrespected your stupid dream.
A lot of love in this room.
- I'm very, very sorry.
- Me too.
- I love you very much.
- I love you too.
I don't want to do this in front of her.
- Okay.
- Okay, Ann, since you're such a genius, what do we do now?
Neither of you want Jamm to win, nor do I, because I hate Paunch Burger, but, if there is one in my backyard, I will eat there, like, every night, and that is no good.
So I say we stop playing dirty with each other, and we start playing dirty with Jamm.
- Yes.
We'll have triple-sex with him.
No.
I have an idea.
It's very uncool, but it's not illegal, technically, but it is a dick move.
I love it.
Hey, Captain.
Status update: My new suspect--the dude who runs carpet emporium.
The way I figure it is, criminals love to wrap things up in rugs.
Plus, he yelled at me when I tried to unroll 'em all, so Andy, while I appreciate your dedication to finding this criminal, I think you might want to take into account what the policeman said.
I mean, gosh, if I can't even investigate bad guys, why become a cop at all?
What are you doing?
When I get bummed out, I take my shirt off because the bad feelings make me feel sweaty.
You know what, maybe I should bail on being a cop.
City Hall needs a new part-time security guard for the weekends.
You want to do that?
Look at it as a way to feel out whether you want to be a police officer.
But, keep in mind, if you take this job, you must keep your clothes on at all times, even if you get sad.
No deal.
Okay, I'll do it.
- That a boy.
- I'll do it.
I promise.
And I get a gun, and I can point it in people's faces.
Incorrect.
Hey.
What the hell is going on?
Oh, hello, Councilman.
The dogs are here because there's no dog park in your neighborhood, and the kids are here because there's no human park in your area.
They all needed a place to play.
My front lawn?
That's right, and they're gonna keep using it until there's an actual park nearby.
Hey, hey, lady, get that thing off my gnome.
He is dry-humping my garden gnome.
- Stupid beast.
- Councilman Jamm, we just need a little bit more time to design our park.
And, if you plow through and ignore us, this is gonna be your life.
I'll call the police.
Yeah, sic the police on a bunch of kids and puppies.
- That's a great photo op.
- Fine.
Gentleman's agreement.
In 90 days, we'll put our plans to a vote.
- Winner take all.
- Deal.
Great, now call off the actual dogs.
I want these kids off my lawn.
I want that hula hoop off my 'Vette.
Right now.
Hey, Jamm.
You just got knoped.
And ludgated.
- And perkinsed.
- Ha-ha.
Nice try.
It didn't work.
You just got jammed.
Okay, so let's get to work.
Wait, wait, wait, do you never just take a second to enjoy things?
I just said, "let's get to work".
How else do people enjoy things?
I know you changed your mind the last time we offered you a job, but we are just thrilled that you changed it again.
Thank you.
Me too.
This is our best office.
As you can see through the window, you have a great view of the billing department.
- Hey, Sharon!
- Shh.
Sorry.
She's fun.
So, please, if there's anything we can do to make you happier in your new job, just let me know.
Oh, no, this is great, Barney.
Thank you.
But I have to quit again.
What-- ohh!
Is this a classic Ben joke?
No.
I'm really sorry.
But I just don't want to do this.
I need to move my life in another direction.
This is disappointing.
Again.
Maybe someday we'll figure out the magic formula that gets you to work here.
Well, formulas are my formula for moolah.
Ted, get in here!
Ben's quitting again, but you gotta hear what he said.
Leslie's been saying for weeks I should do something I love, and she's right.
And I'll help Tom or maybe try to do that TV thing or maybe work for the Sweetums foundation.
I don't know.
Life is short.
Why be an accountant, you know?
I mean, other than the stability and the health plan and the above-average pay.
Oh, God, this better work out.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Support for Pawnee Community Radio comes from listeners like you and from the new film The Shadows of Seven Heads, the dramic tale of an Israeli soldier who falls in love with conjoined Palestinian sextuplets.
Out soon from Focus Features.
Welcome to "Thought For Your Thoughts".
I'm your host Derry Murbles, sitting in for Nina Joplin, who is touring the country performing a spoken-word opera about pear-shaped women.
My guest today is City Councilwoman Leslie Knope.
It is a pleasure to be back, Derry.
Your show last week on dolphin lactation was just riveting radio.
Derry, my team and I are trying to build a park, and we need input on the design from you, the citizens of Pawnee.
So I guess I'm here to send out the Bat-Signal.
A Bat-Signal, for listeners who might not know, refers to the children's character "the Bat-Man" a strong gentleman who fights crime nocturnally.
That's correct.
Well put.
This park is going to be a celebration of Pawnee by Pawnee and for Pawnee.
So, you know, send in your plan or your resume And quick.
Please.
Hurry.
This is all gonna fall apart if you don't hurry.
Coming up after the break, movie reviews with Ken Tucker who is filling in for David Bianculli who's in New York filling in for Ken Tucker.
Leslie, would you like to introduce the next segment?
Okay.
"Now it's time for 'Jazz Plus Jazz Equals Jazz, ' "today we have a recording of Benny Goodman played over a separate recording of Miles Davis".
Research shows that our listeners love jazz.
All right, so this is a letter from what looks like a federal penitentiary.
"Here's a model "of what I thought the park could look like.
Also, I'm innocent.
Please find me a lawyer".
I'm getting kind of worried.
I mean, we have not received one usable idea so far.
Hang on.
Look at this guy.
"30 years of experience "with a degree in architecture from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen".
Wow!
Beautiful fountain.
Perfectly manicured shrubbery.
This is like Parks Department porn.
This guy is great.
I don't care if he's some junkie war criminal pimp.
I am not gonna change my mind.
His name's Wreston St. James.
He's from Eagleton.
Oh, I've changed my mind.
I'm not being melodramatic when I say that people from Eagleton are snobby and evil, and they look down on Pawnee, and they would most likely exterminate everyone who isn't from Eagleton if they weren't so busy being obsessed with themselves.
God, that was close.
Sometimes when I rant about Eagleton, I forget to breathe, and I pass out.
No.
We cannot have someone from Eagleton design a park for Pawnee.
We have had a blood feud that has lasted for 200 years.
Well, we don't have a lot of time, and he is the first decent candidate.
So let's at least go meet the guy.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Then we can reject him face-to-face.
I like your plan.
Friends, former lovers, acquaintances, Jerry, I introduce you to the future home of Rent-A-Swag!
Yikes.
Much like women in '90s stand-up comedy routines, Tommy be shopping.
I started a business where I rent my fancy clothes to teens so their parents don't have to buy them nice things they'll just grow out of.
So if you see a 14-year-old kid wearing a Louis Vuitton cravat, you know who to thank.
Me.
And Louis Vuitton for making some dope-ass cravats.
Son, I love wildlife, but is a store the best place for it?
- Help.
- The place needs some work, but this is a great location.
Lots of foot traffic, no metered parking.
And it's well within my fiscal range.
Good use of the word fiscal, Tommy-- very upscale.
Very impressive.
Watching you gives me faith that anyone can reinvent themselves.
Tommy Timberlake is dead.
Long live Thomas M. Haverford, responsible tycoon.
Help.
I can't move.
He designed this place?
What a dump.
Ben!
Leslie.
Hi!
- Hi.
- Wreston St. James.
- Thank you so much for coming.
- No, thank you.
Well, what do you think of our newest park?
Eh.
In a word, underwhelming.
And a little inconvenient.
There's no trash cans anywhere.
What am I supposed to do with my garbage, - just throw it on the ground?
- Oh, hey.
Thank you for the trash!
Mr. St. James, I have to say, - this park is incredible.
- Thank you.
Its official name is "Five Mile Grounds", but we like to call it "Wide smiles abound".
Because of all the smiles that occur?
It's so boring.
Come on, I'll take you guys on a little tour.
Great.
He seems super-cool.
He seems cool.
Just you wait.
Well, they always wine and dine you first, but the fact of the matter is Eagletonians are, without exception, snobby, condescending jerks.
This is the Pawnee side of our border with Eagleton And this is the Eagleton side.
Ah.
Uhh.
Hey, babe, it's me.
Will you come down here, please, and keep me company?
I'm so bored.
I need you.
If I come down there, can I at least break something?
Of course, baby.
Anything.
You know that.
Chris gave me this great job as a weekend security guard at City Hall.
Only one problem-- it's a terrible job.
I did everything I was supposed to do, and I walked around the building four times.
Only 20 minutes has gone by.
Ugh!
Thought maybe ten minutes had gone by since I started talking.
It's only been 15 seconds.
Ohh Oh, babe, thank God you're here.
I got so bored, I started thinking about existence-- "Do I matter?
Do any of us?
Is there a master plan in the works, a grand design"?
- Just dumb stuff like that.
- Ugh!
Who cares?
I thought being a security guard would be exciting.
Nope.
Wait a minute.
Isn't this how all great Bert Macklin cases start?
It's quiet.
A little too quiet.
As you can see, we like to keep things quite immaculate.
I remember when Pawnee had that massive sewage overflow in Circle Park-- whatever happened with that?
- We totally fixed it.
- Well, except for the smell.
The scientists think it's going to linger for another 40 years.
Can we just cut to the chase here?
Why would a fancy Eagleton architect like you want to design a tiny Pawnee park?
Well, I heard your plea on the radio, and you were so passionate about the project.
It doesn't matter if it's a giant park like this or a little tiny pocket park.
It's about the people.
We're here to serve them.
Hey, Mr. St. James!
Oh, our balloon artisan is out of balloons.
Excuse me.
I have chills.
Look at my arm.
Why are you so charmed by him?
You're like a Southern belle when Rhett Butler comes around.
Yes.
Rhett Butler.
That's who he reminds me of.
Or Bono!
What?
No one from Eagleton has ever wanted to help anyone from Pawnee for any reason.
In 1988, we were hit by a tornado.
We asked Eagleton for help, and they claimed they weren't home.
An entire town claimed they weren't home.
I don't trust that guy for a second.
Leslie, look what Wreston commissioned from the balloon artisan.
It's us.
Great work, team.
Donna, you and your work are ravishing, as usual.
Ann, great organizational skills.
Wow.
Genuine praise.
It's a tip I picked up from Lee Iacocca's autobiography.
A small connection between you and your workers helps build loyalty.
Jerry!
How's the old ticker?
Oh.
Well, uh, the rehab is grueling-- Great!
Glad to hear it.
Yo, Roomba, drop a beat!
Hi ho, hi ho Rent-A-Swag is gonna be the opposite of Entertainment720.
This is my last chance.
If this goes down in flames, I will have nothing except my looks.
I could always pimp myself out to hot older ladies.
I need to remember that.
May, 1817.
A scrappy group of frontiersmen and women arrive at a hardscrabble chunk of land and call it Pawnee, Indiana.
We owe them a debt of gratitude.
Mm.
June, 1817, the richest among them take all of their money from the bank and then flee up the hill like cowards to form Eagleton.
Recognize any of your ancestors among the meanies?
Actually, like most people from the area, I have ancestors on both sides.
That's why I think this rivalry is just a little silly - and self-defeating.
- Yeah, you may not know this, but Leslie was actually born in Eagleton.
Do not blame me for the sins of my mother.
Look, Ms. Knope, I'm really trying here, but I just don't know if our working together is such a great idea.
Oh running away so soon.
Typical.
You know, say what you want about Pawneeans, but we never give up.
We have a mural called "The Many Surrenders of Pawnee".
Oh, look who's paying attention to me now!
Okay.
Can I speak to you privately for a minute?
The name is special agent Bert Macklin.
Tell me who you are, who you work for, and don't bother trying to lie to me, because I'm amazing.
My name is Judy Hitler, and I am the spoiled only daughter of Adolf.
And I'm going to tell my Daddy you were mean to me, Bert Macklin.
He's not going to like it very much.
- So untie me!
- Nice try, Miss Hitler, but you have something that I want.
Where's the necklace with all of Germany's war secrets?
I don't know what you are talking about.
- I think you do!
- I don't!
Now, you give me that war-ending necklace, or I will resort to torture.
Fine.
I will show you where it is, damn it.
You're too good, Macklin.
Don't you do it, Hitler.
Don't you dare fall in love with me.
Oh, Hitler, you sexy bastard.
No!
- Yes!
- MmMm!
Aah!
I am just filled to the brim with questions.
Why are you using this wood?
Is it more pliable?
What are these metal latches?
Are they copper or brass?
Is one better?
And if so, why?
If I tell you, then you won't have learned anything.
Another in a long line of lessons from the great Ron Swanson.
My therapist, Dr. Richard Nygard, suggested that I try some non-exercise-based hobbies.
So I've been studying woodworking with Ron.
I made this.
Before I started, it was bigger.
Here.
I have designed something very important.
Why don't you start work on that right away?
Yes, sir!
It's a flight of stairs that leads to nowhere.
Were you listening to him when he was talking about serving the public and making our communities better?
You know who he sounds like, right?
Yes.
Idi Amin.
- Or Lord Voldemort.
- No.
You.
Now, you've been very rude to him, and you need to apologize.
Ha ha ha.
You are a laugh riot, Ben.
I am never going to apologize to someone from Eagleton.
All right.
So you can kiss your park and four years of work good-bye.
Up to you.
Come on.
You can do it.
- I don't want to.
- You can-- You can do it.
Mr. St. James, this has been a strange day.
But we wouldn't want to leave you with the wrong impression of Pawnee.
Have you guys seen Hitler?
Anyway, we would love to have you design the park, and in the spirit of reconciliation, Leslie would like to apologize.
I may have allowed my prejudices, my totally legitimate prejudices against Eagleton affect my feelings towards your involvement in this project, and so therefore, I would like to say that I'm-- I'm I'm Leslie Knope.
No.
That's not what I want to say.
Okay.
I'm Sss My mouth is kinda dry.
My mouth is dry.
This is Canada Dry.
Drink Canada Dry if your mouth is dry.
That's nothing.
What I want to say is I'm s I'm sor I'm sor-- He's a human being.
You're a human being.
You can just-- just say-- I'm sor-- - Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I-- I'm sorry, very sorry, that I was rude.
- It's too soon.
- You know what, as a gesture of good will, I'd like to waive my fee.
I'll design the park pro bono.
Thank you.
That's very nice of you.
I've been working up a little model of the design.
Why don't I bring it over, and we can all go through it together.
Great.
And then you can come to our wedding.
- Huh?
- What?
It's in May, and we haven't planned it yet, but save the date.
I was never here.
- Ah!
- Aah!
Well done, team.
What do you think of the place?
Do you really like this yellow paint?
I mean, I know it was on sale, but it looks a lot like dried phlegm.
For real, Tom.
This place is sad.
I think one of the mannequins tried to commit suicide.
I think what's important is we all had a goal, and we achieved it.
- So you like the place?
- Oh, no, it's quite terrible.
This is the best I can do for now.
And I'm $46 under budget.
Now I have a small treat for you guys for all your hard work.
Pizza party!
One small pizza for all of us.
With no toppings.
Cheese is a topping, Jerry.
And why are these lights blaring, by the way?
Does someone here own stock in the electric company?
If there were more food and fewer people, this would be a perfect party.
You can't run, Hitler.
is everywhere!
History channel.
Ho ho ho!
What is this?
A child spy, sent to steal the necklace?
Bert Macklin, FBI!
Freeze!
I didn't do anything!
- Yeah, bad call, Bert.
- Oh.
Oh, hey, I'm just kidding, buddy.
I'm just playing around.
My name's really Andy Dwyer.
I'm a security guard.
- What's your name?
- Joey.
I was with my mom, and I got lost.
Oh.
Well, gosh, don't worry about that.
I've gotten lost here about 500 times, and I work here.
What do you say we go find your mom, huh?
She's not in there.
I'll bet.
Let's try this way.
Hello?
Ms. Knope, Mr. Wyatt?
We're from Wreston St. James' firm.
Oh, hey, come on in.
Where's Wreston?
He's on his way.
He wanted us to get started.
Aw!
Oh, well.
Okay, I guess go ahead.
We present the Crown Jewel of Pawnee containing the sights, sounds, and most importantly, smells that define your city.
There are several drool buckets for your more slack-jawed citizens.
We also have food troughs full of cheeseburgers and public showers with instructions for those who've never showered before.
You have five seconds to get out of here Or I will rip your throats out.
Out.
Now.
Oh, hey, my backyard is bigger than your park.
Leslie, stay back, stay back.
I told you that Eagletonians are awful, terrible people.
They call their boogers Pawnee caviar.
I'm on your side, and I'm furious too.
But this just doesn't make sense to me.
I'm gonna talk to Wreston, and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
Any excuse to talk to Wreston.
Well, I am gonna think about a revenge plan.
I know what we're gonna do.
We're gonna find out where he lives.
We're gonna drive to his house.
We're gonna set it on fire and watch it burn.
Leslie, we can't do that.
You're right.
We can't.
All right, so Does this look familiar?
- No, not at all.
- I was talking to Joey.
- Joey!
- Mommy!
There you are.
Oh, God, I was so worried.
Thank you so much.
You'll never know how much I appreciate it.
Well, just doing my job, ma'am.
Thank you for saving me, Andy.
Thank you, too, miss Hitler.
- What?
- Don't worry about it.
Wow.
You made those losers very happy.
Oh, no, I didn't.
- Bert Macklin did.
- No - FBI.
- Actually, Bert Macklin kinda made that little boy cry.
Well, he's a rogue agent who refuses to play by the rules.
Seriously, I think Andy Dwyer makes a better real cop than Bert Macklin.
Maybe it's time for Bert Macklin to hang up his shades.
Can I get you something to drink?
Iced tea, please.
And can I ask you, how are there palm trees here?
Well, Eagleton lies on top of a hot spring which creates a micro-climate zone.
We are truly blessed.
God, I'm so sorry I'm late.
What the hell happened, man?
I had nothing to do with that stupid prank.
In fact, that's why I'm late.
I was firing the two people who were responsible, and I was escorting them out of the building.
WellGood!
Certain people in the firm wanted to promote them, but I insisted they be fired.
If you swear to me that you're serious, maybe we can salvage this.
I would really love to.
But what about Leslie?
I just doubt that she can ever get over the bad blood between our towns.
I think you're wrong.
Leslie is a very forgiving person.
Revenge!
Ha ha hal This is for Pawnee, you butt-faced pompous jerk!
Whoo!
I love you, Ben.
Pawnee forever!
You want a stupid tie?
I'll give you a stupid tie.
Ha ha!
Wreston, suck it.
- Now we're even.
- Leslie.
- Huh?
- He didn't do it, and he fired the people who did.
Attention, please.
I've been going over the books, and I'm missing $9.
Now, I'm not angry at whoever took it.
Just come forward.
You'll be served with a lawsuit, and we will move on with our lives.
Hey, buddy, let's go get some breakfast, okay?
Fine.
It was your idea, so you're paying.
You're driving.
I'm not chipping in for gas.
Okay.
All right.
I'll have the pancake breakfast.
Oh, let me also get and some toast.
in a row in a bag.
You want a carton of eggs and a loaf of bread.
Yeah, just the pancake breakfast is fine.
Don't offer to pay if you're gonna be cheap.
Listen, man, I know you don't want to repeat the mistakes of Entertainment 720, and that's great, but you're gonna need a little bit of the old Tom to make this business work.
No.
That Tom ruined everything.
Yes, he did, and that Tom made you a horrible boyfriend and a terrible employee and drove you to bankruptcy.
Are we nearing the point?
But your swagger and your showmanship and your confidence is part of you, and in small doses, it can help.
You can't have Rent-A-Swag without the swag.
I barely have enough cash to get everything set up.
I know.
Take this.
We all chipped in.
Use it to spruce up the store.
And in return you can give us like one share of stock in the company.
Like a mini public offering.
"Smort", Ann.
Smort.
This is a cause for celebration.
Waiter!
Eight strips of bacon, uncooked, in a sealed package.
I call it the Pawnee Commons, a celebration of Pawnee's history and people.
A Wamapoke-themed playground Food trucks from local restaurants, Li'l Sebastian fountain.
- I mean, it's perfect.
- Thank you.
I can't see myself fighting you on more than I'd expect no less.
I'm just glad you like it.
I've never met two people more passionate about their hometown.
Oh, I'm actually from Minnesota.
Why do you know so much about Pawnee?
Well, I'm in love with a woman from here.
A strange, passionate, goof ball of a woman.
Me.
He's in love with me.
I'm sorry to see you go, Macklin.
You didn't always play by the rules, but damn it, you were a hell of an agent.
Today I say good-bye to the only life I've ever known.
Well, some of the boys chipped in and we got you This.
It isn't much, but it's something to remember us by.
I never even met my family.
- What?
- And this is all I have to show for it?
Totally worth it.
It's been a pleasure serving with you, son.
If you ever need me, you know where to find me-- In bed next to you, probably having sex with you.
Welcome to the new new Rent-A-Swag now with 30% more swag.
I used the money you guys gave me to add a little flair, and I took everything I own in my house and brought it here, except for my bed.
I basically live here now.
I hate all of this, which probably means it's good for your business.
Ron, my woodworking project-- it's for displaying shoes!
Yes.
That was always the plan.
All right, Rent-A-Swag team, I have one more little surprise for you--pizza party!
- Part Two.
- Oh, wow!
Two pizzas.
And toppings!
Only on half.
I'm not Zuckerberg.
Eat up, chumps.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Merry Congratu-Christmas!
- What?
- Half "Merry Christmas," half "Congratulations," because I just received some news.
You, Ron Swanson, have been nominated for an award from the Indiana Fine Woodworking Association.
How did you hear about that?
I've had a "Ron Swanson" Google alert for seven years and it finally paid off.
Recently, I made a chair.
When I was finished, I thought it was a good chair.
I submitted it to the Indiana Fine Woodworking Association, who felt it merited consideration for an award.
It's been a real whirlwind.
I have to confess, I'm very honored by this nomination.
Right?
This might be the first time I've ever wanted to attend an event.
Oh, my God, I love events!
I can't wait to go tonight.
Why are you going?
As your self-appointed emotional guardian, it is my duty to love and support you.
Plus, you know, this is a big deal.
You shouldn't be there alone.
That's correct.
I'm bringing Diane.
Things are going very well with us.
Even better.
I am very excited to meet Diane.
You're not taking "no" for an answer, are you?
Oh, I forgot to sing you my merry Congratu-Christmas carol.
Jingle bells, jingle yay, jingle good for you - Get out.
- Yup.
How about the new sushi place in Eagleton?
I'm allergic to sushi.
Every time I eat more than 80 sushis, I barf.
Hey, Ann, you been to any swanky restaurants lately?
- What's the occasion?
- It's December.
It's the time we celebrate our most sacred and special event: Jerry Dinner Jerry Dinner - Jerry Dinner - Jerry Dinner what the hell is Jerry Dinner?
Every time we laugh at something stupid Jerry does, we put a dollar in this box.
At the end of the year, we take all the cash and treat ourselves to a fancy dinner.
This year, we have $516.
Aw, jeez!
And that's 517.
Oh!
You guys, that's so mean.
It's not mean if he doesn't know about it.
It's like talking about people behind their backs.
- Everybody wins.
- No.
You should at least invite Jerry to the dinner.
Ha!
That's hilarious.
You should do stand-up.
If you're kidding, you suck, but if you're serious, I actually have been thinking about it.
Hey, April, Matlock called.
He wants his cardigan back.
Boom!
I'm out.
Who's Matlock?
Hey, bud.
- Hey!
- How are you?
Great.
I just finished making an entry in my dream journal.
This time, the giant spider got caught in my web.
Progress.
So I feel like we haven't gotten a ton of time together since I got back from D.C. Well, we both are in serious relationships.
You have Leslie and I have my therapist, Dr. Richard Nygard, who I see 15 times a week.
Well, Leslie has plans tonight, so I'm solo.
- You wanna hang out?
- I'd love to.
It--it'll be just like old times in Indianapolis.
- We're back.
- All right.
Lots of hugs.
Welcome to the Indiana Fine Woodworking Awards, or as I like to call it, heaven.
- Ron.
- Ah!
Leslie, may I present Diane Lewis?
- Oh.
- Diane, this is Leslie Knope.
Diane, wow.
Ron has told me so much about you, in that he has told me your name is Diane, and you exist.
Oh, yeah.
He's not a big sharer.
I don't even know what his middle name is.
Oh, it's Ulysses.
I can see why he didn't tell me that.
Mary, mother of God.
That's Christian Becksvoort!
He's the modern master of the Shaker style.
I never dreamed that I would see him in the flesh.
Go over and say hello.
No, I'm sure he gets swamped with attention all the time.
Ooh, if you ladies will excuse me, there is a jack plane that needs my attention.
Go on then.
So tell me everything about yourself: Your kids, your hobbies.
What are your five biggest hopes, dreams, fears, and regrets?
In honor of Jerry Dinner, let's each say our favorite Jerry moment from the past year.
- Yes.
- Mine was The time he slipped on a cinnabon and landed in a bunch of garbage.
My favorite Jerry moment was when he ate a bowl of glue.
My favorite Jerry moment is when you switched out his potato soup with glue and he didn't know.
You're so cute when you're bullying, babe.
You know what?
Ann was right.
This is mean.
We are going to pick up Jerry.
- What?
- No!
It's Christmastime.
Don't you want to be good people?
- Not really.
- Never.
Hey, if we're going that way, can we stop at our place real quick?
'Cause I forgot to put on deodorant.
And a jacket and one of my socks.
Plus, I gotta poop, but I could stop anywhere for that.
I know you didn't, but if you had gone to Hogwarts Academy, which House do you think you would have been?
Look, obviously, I want to say Gryffindor But I've got to go with Hufflepuff.
I respect your honesty.
Gryffindor.
Seeker on the Quidditch team.
Diane, that's my chair, right there.
It's beautiful, Ron.
Yours is the winner.
I'm not sure I stand a chance.
Hey, you most certainly do.
They'd be crazy not to vote for you.
Which one is Ron's?
I don't know.
Smart, funny, independent, and sexy?
Diane Lewis?
More like Diane Sawyer.
Whoa!
What is going on at the Gergiches?
Whoa.
Oh, my God!
Jerry's having a Christmas party!
I can't believe he didn't invite us.
How dare he!
What'd we ever do to him?
It's probably just family.
And Ben and Chris.
And Ann.
I didn't even know she knew Jerry.
Wow.
The Gergiches really go all out.
This is incredible.
Mmm!
This is literally the best non-fat eggnog I've ever had.
Remain calm, but I think you just drank some of the regular, full-fat eggnog.
Chris, one cup won't kill you.
No, but it will add exactly 440 calories.
But you know what?
I'm fine.
You only live once.
Mmm!
I don't know if you know this, but things with fat in them taste way better than things with no fat.
Yeah, Chris-- everybody knows that.
Ron, guess why my thumbs are up.
No.
Because I'm giving you my 100% approval about Diane.
She is perfect for you.
She gets you.
She is at the bar right now ordering a Lagavulin, neat for you.
I mean, she's even putting up with all this stupid, boring woodworking stuff.
I'm sorry, but, you know, it's not the Super Bowl, guys.
Let's take it down a notch.
Anyway, you have my approval.
I don't need your approval.
- But you have it.
- Don't need it.
But you got it.
This could end up being the best night in Ron Swanson's life.
I am so, so happy for him-- Hello, you gorgeous craftsmen.
Wow, look at this room.
So much wood, ready to be worked.
me!
Alert alert, alert, alert.
She's here, isn't she?
Oh, hey, Ron.
What a coincidence.
Gosh, I never dreamed you'd be here.
Tammy, this is Diane.
Diane, this is a piece of human garbage named Tammy, who is also my ex-wife.
Twice ex-wife.
We were married twice.
And divorced twice.
Everything is done.
They are totally done.
Tammy, what are you doing here?
Oh, I just have a little something I need to get drilled.
Can I speak with you for a moment?
Everything's fine, we're just gonna chat.
Shouldn't you be at the library, forcing people to borrow books?
Leslie, you and I both know that the library closes at 3:00 p.m. Of course it does.
Besides, I like to keep tabs on Ron.
So you can ruin his life?
So I can have fun with him, and sometimes ruining his life can be a part of that, sure.
This may be the hardest challenge yet for Leslie Knope, emotional guardian.
I need to protect a sweet couple from a sex-crazed demon librarian who makes me question my stance on using the "B" word.
I don't know, maybe just this once.
No, Leslie, fight it.
Fight it.
It looks warm in there!
Warm and happy.
Mm, look at that gingerbread man.
What?
I don't see any gingerbread cookies.
I'm talking about that jacked-up, light-skinned dude.
Look like Blake Griffin.
You guys!
There's a buffet-- in the house!
I didn't even know you could do that!
We need to crash this party.
Ann, let us in.
Let's go.
Well, well, well.
You want to come into Jerry's party?
And why is that?
I need a place to deliver this baby, Ann.
It's coming out of me right now.
I'm pregnant.
This is a lovely party thrown by a lovely man and his lovely family.
There's no place for meanies.
Aw, forget it, I'm coming in.
Ow!
- Get off me.
- Wait.
You're so weak, really?
I mean, I'm barely even doing anything.
Are you iron-deficient?
Let me look at your palm.
Ow.
It's because of your man strength, Man Perkins.
Let us in, Ann.
It's cold outside, and I can't wear mittens 'cause they're unflattering to my hands.
Sorry, guys.
This is your penance.
You can come in if you do something nice for Jerry.
Hey, I already did something nice for Jerry.
I drove here to take him to Jerry Dinner.
Oh, Donna.
You can come in.
Okay.
What?
What about us?
- What?
Donna!
- Merry critches, bitches!
Donna, don't leave us!
Donna?
Oh, well, whatever.
It's Jerry's party.
How cool could it be?
Santa!
- They have a Santa!
- Oh, my God.
- What?
- Aw!
Welcome to the Indiana Fine Woodworking Association Awards.
I'm your host, Martin Housely, and wow, it's gonna be a great show-- knock on wood.
- That's good.
- Oh, my gosh.
What a coinky-dinky.
Look, we're sitting at the same table!
Tammy, this table is reserved.
A guy traded me his seat for a peek and a squeeze.
That's my boob and my butt, respectively.
Remember that, Ron?
Subtle.
Well, you know, they asked me if I would host this event, and I said, "Would I"?
Ben, come meet Jerry's wife.
Gayle?
- Happy holidays, Chris.
- It's so good to see you.
I have someone I'd like you to meet.
I'm Gayle Gergich.
Gayle-- you're Gayle?
Jerry's beautiful wife - Oh.
- Who looks like that.
Gayle, I hope you're not in any way uncomfortable that I'm here, - since I dated your daughter.
- Oh, not at all.
You're welcome here any time.
Oops, there's a little hair on your shoulder.
Oh.
Well, look who's a silver fox.
Will you look at that?
I'm sorry, you're okay?
You don't feel like your body is in decay or death is inevitable?
My, my.
Somebody's being a gloomy goose.
Yeah.
Relax, gloomy goose.
Welcome, everybody, to another Gergich Christmas.
Sadly, one of our three beautiful angels, Millicent, couldn't be here tonight, but our other two beauties-- Miriam and Gladys-- are going to help Gayle and me play a little tune.
Here we go a-caroling, among the leaves so green - here we come a-wandering, so fair to be seen love and joy come to you and to you glad Christmas too and God bless you and send you a happy new year and God send you a happy new year I'm going to call a cab.
Why does everyone act like Jerry's the victim here?
He's the one that didn't invite us to his Christmas party.
- Jerry Filter!
- Jerry Filter!
Who's Jerry Filter?
Unsurprisingly, Jerry sends a lot of annoying emails.
So a while ago, I put a filter on all our accounts.
Everything from Jerry goes directly to spam.
A-a-and Here's our invitation.
There's three years of nice messages on here.
"Congratulations on your wedding.
I'm rooting for you kids.
Jerry".
"Hope you have the best birthday, Tom".
I just tied my high score in Snake.
Our next award is for "Achievement in Chairs".
The nominees are: Asa Christiana for chair, Ron Swanson for chair, - H.W. Davenport for chair.
- So exciting, Ron.
Okay, Ron, this is your moment.
Tune her out.
She's not even here.
And the winner is Ron Swanson for chair.
Oh, wow!
Whoo!
This award is the only one I'd ever give a damn about.
I made my first chair when I was five, but the quality of the wood was wanting, so when I turned nine, I used my factory wages to purchase some beautiful local walnut.
Uh, thank you for this Uh, this all good-- night good.
Uh There it is.
Hey, you're looking at a picture of Millie.
You want to take off, grab some vegan fries?
She really was delightful.
I truly wish her all the best.
Man, maybe going to therapy I mean, if you'd seen that picture a month ago, you would have fallen apart.
It's just a picture.
- Millie!
- Hi, mom!
We wanted to surprise you and come home early.
Oh, hey, Chris.
Hi.
Let's take a moment now to remember those woodworkers who are no longer with us, and the beautiful coffins they all designed themselves.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Have you seen Ron?
He disappeared after the speech and I can't find him anywhere.
Diane-- ugh.
The stuff with Tammy is so complex and weird and gross.
It just would probably be better if you let me handle it.
I'm not worried about Tammy.
I mean, I'm a middle school vice-principal.
I deal with hormonal psychopaths all the time.
Oh, great.
Good.
- What concerns me is you.
- You who?
- You you.
- You me?
You're the one who's been at his side all night.
You're the one who's been protecting him, you're the one who knows all the intimate details of his romantic history with that monster.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Diane, you misunderstand.
I'm happily engaged.
You and Ron have an intimacy that I just don't understand, so if there is a threat to my relationship with Ron, it's not Tammy.
It's you.
Okay, folks, fasten your seatbelts.
It's the big one: Best Desk.
Where's Diane?
I need her.
- She left.
- Of course.
Tammy ruins everything.
No, she left because of me.
She's threatened by our relationship.
That's ridiculous.
I don't think of you romantically.
You're pro-government, you never stop talking, and you have blonde hair.
You're my worst nightmare.
Excuse me, one man's "worst nightmare" is every other man's "total package".
But the point is, I don't think it's about dating.
I kind of see where Diane is coming from.
We are close friends, and I'm very involved in your life.
I wouldn't say we're close.
By Swanson standards, we're close.
I know when your birthday is.
So does Baskin-Robbins.
I know that you secretly love artichokes - and plums.
- Keep your voice down, woman!
Fine, we're friends.
So what do I do?
Tammy's waiting for me in my car.
I think you should take my car and go get Diane, and I will handle Tammy.
Thank you.
Protect your eyes, she's a gouger.
Good to know.
Chris, I'd like you to meet my fiance, Carl.
- Well.
- Hi, there.
Hi.
How did you two meet?
Whitewater rafting.
He was the young rafting instructor all the girls were into, and I was the young rafting instructor all the guys were into And then we got together.
Ah, so random, right?
What a story!
I felt like my heart was whitewater rafting.
Well, I won't keep you guys.
It's good to see you.
Mwah.
Oh, little tip, there is fat in the eggnog.
Okay.
So how'd it go?
You okay?
I'm fine.
If therapy has taught me anything, it's that I need to face my fears, even when my fears are engaged to a man with the chiseled jawline of a young me.
Thank you, Ben.
Thank me?
For what?
For looking out for me tonight.
You're a good friend.
Hey So Gayle and Jerry-- I've thought about it a lot.
There's no logical explanation.
Well, hello there, Big B-- Gross!
Leslie?
Where's Ron?
Too late, Tammy.
Ron's gone.
You'll never get him back.
Wanna bet?
That relationship is weak.
All I have to do is find Ron within the next few hours, and he's toast.
Few hours, you say?
Leslie!
Stop this car!
Where are we going?
I don't know.
You're gonna regret this!
Well, hello again.
You ready to be nice to Jerry?
Because it's so cold out here, it reminds me of my wife's lasagna.
I actually like that one.
Hey, guys!
I thought you weren't coming.
I--you know, never got your RSVP.
Hi, Jerry.
We got you a gift.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah, just-- we took up a collection to pay your hospital bills, since you almost farted yourself to death.
Every time we did something mean, we put a dollar in a box.
Wow.
I'm the luckiest man on earth.
Okay, well, come on in!
It's a party.
Uh-- Oh, jeez.
- Give me the keys!
- No!
- Give 'em to me!
- Never!
Hey, game over, Tammy.
- What?
You--!
- Ah!
I'm going in!
Oh, my God, I am so turned on right now.
What is wrong with you?
Oh, yeah, tell me you're not feeling this.
You are so crazy!
I got 'em!
- I got 'em.
- No!
- No!
- Ah!
You'll never catch me!
Come back here-- Ow!
You are not gonna ruin this night!
- Get away from this car!
- No!
What are you doing?
You're crazy!
Ron!
Ron!
Ha!
You're too late!
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
She just knows you so well, and I was starting to wonder if I was ever gonna get to that point.
I'm worried that maybe there isn't room in your life for another woman.
At this very moment, Leslie is throwing herself in front of a freight train named Tammy for me and you.
Leslie is a wonderful, loyal friend, who is very important in my life, but I would sooner visit Europe than have something romantic happen between us.
Although, if you'd like to visit Europe, I like you so much, I'd be willing to risk it.
But not France, right?
God, no.
See?
You know me pretty well already, but you're about to get to know me even better.
I brought you here because I want to show you something that almost no one knows about-- certainly not Tammy, and not even Leslie Knope.
Ladies and gentleman, and especially the ladies, put your hands together for the one, the only, my man, Mr. Duke Silver.
A mighty fine holiday evening to you all.
- Yeah.
- It might be cold outside, but it's about to get warm all up in my jazz.
I, of course, am Duke Silver, and I would like to dedicate this first song To my duchess.
You're so lucky.
I'm going to kill you.
I think it's time to officially retire as Ron's emotional guardian.
That's Diane's job now, and she seems more than up to the task.
I mean, I'd do anything for Ron-- even spend a whole night fighting his crazy ex-wife.
But I think I'm safe.
She's gotta be tired by now.
Hi.
- Officer Skorggel.
- I pulled over a Tammy Swanson for driving erratically.
Ran the plates, saw it was your car.
Figured it was stolen.
Hey, Ron, why don't you get me out of these handcuffs, so I can put you into these handcuffs.
Yes, please officer, get her out of those cuffs.
I want this to be a fair fight.
Officer, did you see any sign of a passenger?
Ron!
There we go.
Hey!
Help.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Mr. Hotate, hi.
Thank you for coming.
Would you like some water?
Water?
Like fire water?
That's racist, and I do not appreciate it.
No, no, no, no, no.
I-I didn't mean it like that.
I just meant, you know-- I'm just messing with you.
Oh, my God!
He's funny.
This guy's funny.
- He does that sometimes.
- But seriously.
I'll have a whiskey.
Ken Hotate is the leader of the Wamapoke people, and we are trying to get them involved in our Pawnee Commons project.
Ken and I get along great.
But historically, Pawnee's relationship with the Wamapoke has been more Murder-y.
What about--and I'm just spit-balling here-- a large neon advertisement for the Wamapoke casino?
We have a new slogan that I'm quite proud of: "Our slots are downright filthy".
I think it's a slam-dunk idea.
I think we're done here.
I don't-- I don't think we are.
I don't know if we could put that in a public park.
In that case, the playground will be great.
Why don't we retire to my longhouse and smoke the ceremonial peace pipe to celebrate?
- Is he joking?
- I don't know.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Mr. Best Man and Bachelor boy.
Ann Perkins, Maid of Honor, are you ready for the bachelorette party?
Uh, more than ready.
We've got dancing, Jell-o shots, private karaoke, and anything that can be penis-shaped will be penis-shaped.
- Ohhh!
- What?
As Leslie's maid of honor, I really need her bachelorette party to go well.
Which is why I'm stress-eating gummy penises.
What are you losers doing for your bachelor party?
I told Ben he could do whatever he wants.
Sky is the limit.
We have Haverford, Swanson, Dwyer-- Jerry forced his way in there somehow-- things are bound to get crazy.
The game is Settlers of Catan.
The object is be the first to build a civilization on this fictional island.
I can't believe this is what you want to do for your bachelor party.
Look, guys, we don't have to play this game if you don't want to.
I mean, I'm nationally ranked, so it isn't even really fair.
Ben, this is your night.
We do what you want to do.
Come on, let's play.
I'm not a big bachelor party kind of guy, so when the guys asked me what my perfect night would be, I told them the truth-- beer and board games.
They thought I was kidding.
I was not kidding.
Is this gonna be one of those cool bachelorette parties where things get out of control and we murder someone, and then we all have to take a blood oath to never reveal our secret?
No.
Then I might have to leave early.
What the hell?
Well, well, well.
Don't you ladies look nice For once?
Just kidding.
I've actually always been attracted to this one.
Jamm, what the hell are you doing?
We're laying the groundwork for Pawnee's newest restaurant.
"Future home of Paunch Burger.
Start drooling, fatties"?
Look, the deal was that both of us had three months to get our proposals together, and then we put it up for a vote.
- We still have two weeks left.
- Yeah, that's true.
However, here's the problem.
Turns out, I don't care.
You can't stop this train.
Make all the ruckus you want.
By the time this all gets cleared up, the people will be frothing at the mouth for that beef.
Aw, sweet!
A new Paunch Burger.
Their burgers will kill you!
They're full of wasps!
Yeah, but they taste real good.
Yes, they do, sir.
Once again, open invitation.
I'm still technically married, but my wife knows the deal.
Ugh.
Oh, I'm sorry, what's this?
Seven contiguous segments, giving me longest road and a sweet-ass ten points for the win.
Oh, booyah!
Okay.
All right.
Guys, come on over here.
Gather round.
I want to propose a toast.
To our new Lord of Catan, Ben Wyatt, a great friend and a wonderful man.
May you and Leslie find eternal happiness together.
- Hey.
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Thanks, you guys.
Thanks for indulging me.
Hey, you want to stick around?
I got a bunch of Homeland episodes burning a hole in my DVR.
No!
I'm sorry.
On principle, I cannot stand idly by and watch a bachelor party peter out like this.
Now, I know you said no strippers 'cause they make you sad.
Correct.
Then let's go get a drink at Essence.
It's the hot new bar in Eagleton.
Things Magazine said it's the next big thing.
But, Tom, this is Ben's night.
Oh, believe me, if the group's happy, I'm happy.
- I'd go.
- If you guys spot me.
It sounds expensive.
Just so you know, it's not your typical bar.
They specialize in molecular mixology.
It's kind of like an experimental new way to consume alcohol.
Son, there's no wrong way to consume alcohol.
Here's your Bud light.
- I ordered a beer.
- That is a beer.
And here's your Nimbus Martini.
May I go ahead and chisel your aromasphere?
Please!
This is the wrong way to consume alcohol.
Whoa, that's a pretty stiff cloud.
- Who ordered the Scotch?
- Right here.
Hold out your hands, please.
What's happening?
Oh, this is a sort of play on Scotch.
It's a whiskey-infused lotion.
Can I ask if this entire establishment is a practical joke of some kind?
If you don't like the Scotch, they have a vodka that's served in the form of a flash of light.
Hey.
Having fun?
Well, four years of work down the drain, and I have a penis on my head.
Jamm is stealing this lot right out from under us.
My dream is dead, Ann.
Mine too.
This is why I prefer nightmares.
You are sad drinking right now, and I need you to be happy drinking.
Like when we watch Grease together.
I know, Ann, but everything's gonna disappear.
April's mini-dog park, the Li'l Sebastian fountain, even the Wamapoke playground.
Yet another piece of Wamapoke land plowed over by the white man.
Just try to forget about it.
I mean, there's nothing you can do to stop them tonight.
For almost 200 years, Pawnee repeatedly built factories, restaurants, and other stuff on land held sacred by the Wamapoke people.
So we passed a law saying that if any sacred Wamapoke artifact is found on a development site, all construction must immediately stop.
It would be terrible if that were to happen on this future Paunch Burger site.
Oh, this is bad.
I should not have done this.
Oh, I wonder who that is.
Well, if it isn't Babe Lincoln!
- Imagine that.
- Hello, ladies.
I'm Abraham Lincoln.
Who's the lucky Mary Todd?
Right here.
Right here.
Ah, ah, ah, me first.
Me first.
Oh, okay.
All right, tear it up, 16!
Emancipate them abs.
Come on, Ann, not now.
Come on, Leslie, just loosen up.
I know for a fact this is a sex dream you've had.
Looks like it's time for the Gettysburg undressed!
Okay.
And we're gonna have to stop now.
I'm sorry, I'm just not in the mood for historical nudity.
Please, Mr. president, put your pants back on.
Ann, can I speak with you privately?
Is your name Glenn?
- Yeah.
- I sat behind you in middle school band.
Do you still play the clarinet?
Yeah.
How have you been, man?
Man, if I ever have a bachelor party, I am definitely coming back here.
You never had one before you were married to Wendy?
No, it was a green card wedding.
I did watch the three-way sex scene from Wild Things a few times the night before, but it didn't really count.
I never had a bachelor party either.
Me and April, we got married with no warning.
I didn't even have time to take a shower before my wedding.
Or after.
For, like, a week and a half.
Tammy One forbade me from any kind of celebration, and Tammy Two thwarted me by calling in a bomb threat to the steakhouse.
I didn't have one either!
Yeah, really, it's a funny story.
So two weeks before I married Gayle, I had an emergency appendectomy.
Boop!
That's me hitting the snooze button.
Don't talk again for another ten minutes.
New idea!
Tonight, everyone gets the bachelor party they never had.
One activity per bachelor.
Welcome to Tom's bachelor party, held in a white airplane hangar from the ice planet Hoth, replete with dangling, beautiful aerialists.
To Tom Haverford.
To Tom Haverford!
Hey, hey-- and to my bride, Rihanna.
We truly did find love in a hopeless place.
Waiter, a round of light-flash shots for me and my friends!
- Ohhh!
- Whoo!
Okay, so what happened?
Well, I buried a bunch of Wamapoke artifacts in the dirt so that people would find them and have to stop developing at the site.
You know, when I say it out loud, it doesn't sound so bad.
- No, that's bad.
- Yeah, that's pretty uncool.
- Shut up, Glenn.
- I'm sorry, guys.
Councilman Jamm was being sneaky, and then I tried to sneaky him back, and it turned to crummy, and I have to undo it.
I need your help.
- You don't mean-- - I do.
No.
I'm not doing that.
You guys, the penis hats cut your digging time in half.
I'm serious.
Don't be afraid.
Use the penises.
Bachelorette party.
Whoo.
Perkins does it again.
You know, I met Gayle right here at Sherm's.
- Mm-mm.
- She was slender.
Blonde hair, big breasts, long legs.
Ugh, not my type at all.
And what was it, exactly, that led to you two hitting it off?
Was she ill, or did your father witness her father committing a crime?
- Or was she temporarily blind-- - You know what?
All that matters is that you got married, and you're happy.
So as all-time best man, I suggest we raise a cone to Jerry Gergich.
Jerry Gergich.
- Jerry!
- Thank you.
- Gergich.
- Aw, jeez.
No worries, Gary.
Oh, thanks, Sherm.
How did you have that ready so fast?
I always make a backup cone.
He drops it about half the time.
Andy, you're next.
Any activity in the world.
What would you do?
Well, mine's impossible.
I want to see a Colts game.
I want to see the Colts beat the Patriots 49 to nothing, then I yell at Tom Brady and make him cry, then I hook up with Dave Matthews, and we play golden tee for ten hours.
A-la-la baby that's a very specific dream, son.
Hey, Jim, Chris Traeger.
I need a favor.
I'm dead.
I am dead.
And this is what heaven is like.
I knew it.
Oh, this is where they play the games!
You're up, Andy.
Hey, guys!
Guys, come on over here.
Andy, I want you to meet Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay.
Andy, good to meet you, my friend.
Thank you.
I love your team, sir.
I love them like they're my own children.
You're big enough to play football yourself, it looks like to me.
I can't tell if you're joking, but I hope you're not.
This whole place is yours.
Jim Irsay and I became friends while volunteering to mentor Indianapolis teens.
I gave them tours of the state house.
Jim gave them Colts tickets and autographed jerseys.
They preferred Jim.
Reggie Wayne.
I can't look at you, Reggie Wayne.
Oh.
I got married in your jersey.
That's no joke.
That's weird.
But I respect that.
I'm a big fan, Mr. Luck.
Okay, guy, settle down.
- Okay.
- Uh, Mr. Andrew Luck, it's every groom's dream to catch a touchdown pass thrown by you.
Could you do me the honor?
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Keep the spiral tight.
- I'll try.
- Okay.
Touchdown, Dwyer!
- Andy!
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
- See ya!
Hey, yeah I wanna shoop, baby shoop, shoop-ba-doop uh, here I go here I go here I go again girls what's my weakness?
- men - Okay then uh ooh, let's call Ann real quick.
Rub it in.
Hello?
- Ann Perkins!
- Ann Perkins!
We're having the time of our lives, and I'm calling you to rub it in!
- Whoo!
- Boom!
- Really.
- We went to an insane bar, played football with the Colts.
- With the Colts!
- The Colts!
Football!
Now we're going to a steakhouse.
What are you doing?
Uh, well, we're surrounded by hot guys.
- We're surrounded by hot guys.
- Boom!
Oh, Donna just ripped off a stripper's underwear with her teeth.
- Whoo!
- Ann, who are you lying to?
- Shh.
- No!
Can I take a break?
My hands are tired.
Uhuh.
We paid for an hour.
You gonna dig for an hour.
Gentlemen, welcome to the Steak House of St. Elmo.
- Whoo!
- Yes!
Tonight we eat something's flesh!
I want meat!
Jerry, are you sure this is our table?
There's only four settings.
Excuse me, sir.
This is not your table.
Well, I thought you said the Gergich party.
No, no, I said the Gingrich party.
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.
Damn it, Jerry.
But you know what?
Gingrich, Gergich.
I wonder if we're related.
I don't think so, Jerry.
Okay.
One rare porterhouse, one rare sirloin, and a rasher of bacon.
- Oh.
- It's the lord's work you're doing, John.
I'd like four more glasses of Lagavulin in liquid form.
That's not something you really need to specify.
You'd be surprised.
So, bachelor boy, how's it going with Diane?
Hmm.
I'm gonna be very candid with you all.
I like her.
- Whoa!
- Wow!
Okay, okay, okay.
There are so many things that I could say about Ron, but I think that the best man's speech should represent the groom.
So I will just say To Ron.
- Oh, to Ron!
- To Ron!
To Ron.
Just perfect.
Perfect, Chris.
Here you are, sir.
And I thought you might also like to know that your meal has already been taken care of - by Mr. Hibbert.
- W-what?
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Hey!
- Oh, whoa!
What's up, Jell-o shot?
- Hey, man.
- How's it going?
Roy Hibbert.
Entertainment 720 reunion.
Hey, Tom.
I am not paying for that guy.
He owes me a lot of money.
It's true.
Coffee?
Yes, please.
Take extra cream, 30 sugars.
I can't believe I tried to exploit the Wamapoke for my own personal gain.
Well, we got most of the artifacts, and even if we didn't, they probably won't find them.
Yeah, and if they do, you'll just go to jail.
But you can make wine in your toilet and fight people, which is a super-cool way to live.
Oh, my God.
Tweep.
I tweeped.
I called Tweep.
Look, I'm telling the truth here, lady.
We haven't found any American Indian artifacts.
Or regular Indian.
Japanese, Muslim, Jewish, none of those weird countries.
- Weird countries?
- Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Wow, I'm so glad that you're here.
What's going on?
Nothing?
Found something!
There's other stuff too.
Arrowheads, more pottery.
I also found some weird-looking gummy candy.
All right, shut it down.
This is a P.R. nightmare.
We can't do anything until the Indian Affairs Commission weighs in.
This is  bull.
Okay.
Lesie, Ken Hotate is right over there, you need to talk to him before the meeting and come clean.
He's gonna be so mad.
The zodiac killer never confessed.
Why do I have to?
Leslie, I want the Pawnee Commons as bad as you do.
Actually, that's not true.
You want everything a thousand times more than I do.
But we do not want to win this way.
Oh, April, I wish you weren't right, but you are.
You have turned into a very beautiful, wise, and fertile government employee.
Stop.
It's kind of weird when she just starts raining compliments on you, huh?
Don't try to bond with me.
Can't win.
Hey, guys, I had these T-shirts made.
They're not exactly a summary of the party - we ended up having.
- Whoa.
But they're a good memento.
Madness indeed.
I love this!
Usually you can only get board game t-shirts in XXL.
I just remembered.
We left Jerry back at the gas station in Martinsville.
I'll go get him.
Ah, that guy's the best.
I feel bad he didn't get to have his moment last night.
Hey, you know what we should do for him?
Yeah, get him a pet snake, but I keep it.
What?
In 1921, several Wamapoke families were removed from their homes so that Pawnee could install a bumper car track.
In 1951, Pawnee made it illegal for people to, "Dance or smell like a native American".
Why are you telling me all this?
Well, I want to raise the bar of awfulness so that when I confess something to you, you have perspective.
Those artifacts found at lot 48 were placed there by me.
I wanted to delay construction on the Paunch Burger and buy some more time for my park project.
That is not great.
It sucks.
I'm very, very sorry.
I have great respect for the Wamapoke culture.
And this isn't even about the Pawnee Commons.
I just hope that you can forgive me, Ken.
Hey!
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?
Congratulations.
You have won the award for Best Nan.
Full disclosure-- I voted for Ryan Gosling, but you came in a close second.
Now, you've never been married, so you didn't get your own bachelor party.
But let's look ahead.
The year is 2018.
America is thriving under president Nick Cannon, and tomorrow, Chris Traeger's getting married.
Who's the lucky lady?
Maybe she's an upbeat gal who's nuts about fitness.
Maybe she owns a juice bar in Snerling.
Maybe it's April.
Maybe I die.
Skydiving explosion.
Pbbbt.
And then you go marry April.
And it makes me sad, but if she's gonna be with somebody, I'd like it to be you.
Strange, but sweet.
Only I didn't really die.
I was faking it.
And I come back.
I spy on you from my red Corvette.
And I'm planning to kick your ass, but I see how happy you make her, and I have to walk away.
I have to.
And I do, slowly.
In a rainstorm.
Okay, this isn't really in the spirit of what we're trying to do.
But as time goes by, it eats away at me.
You're out living it up with my wife.
And I'm alone.
In a cave.
Training.
Anyone else want to chime in?
I thought you were my friend.
I thought you were my friend!
Okay, what we're trying to say is that you are a great guy, and someday, you're gonna meet somebody who's into all the same stuff that you are.
You know, the old Chris would've loved this super-fit health goddess you guys are talking about.
But our great adventure reminded me that now I just want someone that values the important things in life-- friendships, passion, happiness.
And dimples are a plus.
Aw, that's sweet.
I forgive you, bro.
You take care of April.
After careful examination, we have determined that these Wamapoke artifacts could not have originated in lot 48.
Boom.
Knew it.
There's something else.
I would like to go on record and say that-- Hold on, Ms. Knope.
Please.
I would like to go on record.
Speaking as a citizen of Pawnee, I do not like the way you went back on your deal with Councilwoman Knope.
It reminds me of what the settlers of Pawnee did to my ancestors, taking their land without permission.
He really plays white people like a fiddle.
Wow.
It's amazing to watch.
You and Leslie had a deal.
If that deal is not restored, well, I believe there are six Paunch Burgers in the Wamapoke casino.
Perhaps it's time that we revisited those contracts.
Is that a threat?
Why, yes, I-- I thought that was obvious.
Take the sign down.
We'll wait until everything's official.
In the spirit of fair play, I suggest we put on these authentic Wamapoke headdresses and dance around the table.
Absolutely not.
That sounds highly offensive.
Does it, white man?
No.
It's not offensive.
- So let's do it.
- You first.
So clearly, this is not offensive.
It is offensive.
- I am very sorry.
- Take it off.
Hey, Wyatt.
Oh, hey, Shauna.
So I was chasing this story, but it seems like a dead end.
Then I heard about your crazy rotating bachelor party.
Would you mind if I wrote about it?
Sure.
But is that really news?
To me it is.
A group of good friends having fun, doing nice things for each other.
I mean, that's what's important in life, and I want to write about it.
Hey, Chris.
Ben Wyatt.
And Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Hey, Shauna's doing a story on our group bachelor party.
She said she wanted to write stories about good people doing nice things for each other.
So I figured you two might have a lot to talk about.
You may be right about that.
Do you have a second right now?
I have thousands of seconds.
Would you like to have lunch?
Are you a vegetarian?
A vegan?
A pescatarian?
Not that it matters.
- Um, I like burgers.
- Perfect.
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh!
Three, ten, bullock!
Three, ten, bullock!
Give it to me.
How great a day was today?
Oh, God, I could die.
Greatest day of my life.
I met Andrew Luck today.
I met Reggie Wayne today.
And I met Jim Irsay.
I'm standing on the field.
Lucas Oil Stadium.
And I'm playing football with my friends.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Well it's a pleasure to be here, ladies.
I didn't think anybody really cared about my time on the city council.
Oh, we do.
I mean, you are such an inspiration.
Still going strong at 82.
How old is that handkerchief?
Well, it's not a handkerchief.
It's a receipt.
Paula Horke was Pawnee's first female city councilor a huge inspiration to me.
Women have come a long way in Pawnee, but we still have quite a ways to go.
I mean, technically, I'm not allowed to reserve this conference room without my husband or father's signature.
Government was a real boys' club back in the '70s.
They smoked their cigars, they snapped my bra, wore mirrors on their shoes to look up my skirt.
Well, I am happy to report that it is now a pervert-free people's club.
Well, except for Councilman Dexhart, who's a self-described pervert.
Yeah, and didn't Milton try to kiss you?
Well, yeah, things aren't perfect.
All the other councilmen used to keep a calendar of my menstrual cycle.
Are you kidding me?
That is horrible.
They don't do that to me.
Do they do that to me?
I once tried to start a commission to try to get more jobs for women in city government, and they dismissed me, saying that it was because it was just my time of the month.
Admittedly, they were right.
Because of the calendar.
Manpigs.
All of them.
You know what, I'm gonna get that commission going, because this inequality has gone on long enough.
You know what, I think men are better than women.
She's kidding.
No, I'm not.
They provide for us, and we must obey them because they are our masters.
April, stop it.
Leslie, you'll never land a beau with that domineering tone.
We must always walk behind the men.
Sheugh.
Moustache!
Dumb-dumb!
Moustache!
Dumb-dumb!
- Hello.
- I just came to drop off some of the employee-- What is happening?
The girls are on break, and their sitter had to go out of town for the day, so I'm watching them while Diane works.
I borrowed some markers from Leslie and some stickers from Leslie and a Lite-Brite which I got from Andy.
Girls, this is Ann.
Talk to Ann.
She's terrific.
Hey, dudettes.
You stoked about the weekend?
No.
Oh, look at this pwetty, pwetty wittle beads.
They're not infants.
I don't know.
I'm weird with kids.
So you guys like Coldplay?
You're weird.
You're Well, hey, girls.
No.
Okay.
Thanks.
An equal gender employment commission.
Leslie, I don't think this is a good idea.
I think it's a fantastic idea.
Oh.
I didn't know where you were going with that.
The lack of women in this government is criminal.
I'm gonna ask each department to send two people to a meeting today.
- Yeah!
- And!
And--and I can ask Shauna Malwae-Tweep to write an article about it for the Pawnee Journal.
She's my special friend.
That's what you're calling her now.
I don't know what to call her.
I don't entirely understand the behavior of young people.
Recently, we engaged in something called a "group hang".
It was like a date, but there were seven other people there.
It was very confusing.
I'm not really sure what our label is.
Labels can be bad, but they can also be good.
"Warning: Toxic bleach" is a good label.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep has amazing dimples.
- So the commission?
- Yes, right, the commission.
- I'm gonna get that going right now.
- Great.
Okay, I know this text you sent me was a lie and Michael Stipe is not actually here, correct?
Correct.
That was a lie.
Yeah, no, I knew it was.
I just couldn't live with myself if it had been true.
And that's why I sent it.
Where's free Skittles?
Here you go, buddy.
Aw!
He gets his thing?
Listen, I need you two to teach me everything you know about basketball.
Rent-A-Swag is doing really well.
I'm on track to turn a profit in my third month.
One problem: All the kids that shop in the store are basketball crazy.
It's all they talk about.
I need to be able to schmooze them, and I can't keep referring to basketball players as "Khloe Kardashian's husband and his friends".
You're just the men to help me out.
One jock, one geek who loves stats.
I'll give you a few minutes to cancel the rest of your plans for the day.
No need.
My only plan was to buy Skittles.
Wow, Chris.
Your gender equality commission is a real sausage fest.
Oh, my God.
You're kidding me.
I just assumed that some of the departments would send women.
Oh, my God.
I am part of the problem.
Excuse me, everyone.
Did anyone notice that there are no women on the Gender Equality Commission?
Oh, there's a lady right next to you.
Oh, wait, no.
It's just a very beautiful man.
Yes, okay, we are gonna need to rebalance this commission.
Listen, you did a great job setting it up and getting the snacks ready, but we'll take it from here.
Well, Councilman Milton, I did put the snacks together, and they are delicious, I must say, but that is not the point.
Round of applause for the girl.
She has to leave to get more snacks.
No, I don't!
This is my commission!
Ouch.
Why so ornery?
It's not the 7th yet.
Hm.
Your shoes are red now.
- Yay.
- Hooray.
Hey!
Mommy!
You survived, huh?
Indeed, I did.
How were they?
Really?
Couldn't have been better.
We had a wonderful time.
Well, that's good.
'Cause my sitter's still out of town, so I really hate to ask you this, but is there any way you could take them again tomorrow?
Of course.
I'd be delighted.
You're a lifesaver.
Thank you.
Girls, you wanna spend another day with Ron?
Yeah!
I believe one problem with hiring women is that they're frail and breakable.
Is it possible you're thinking about light bulbs?
- Or your hip?
- Mm.
If I were 300 years older, Councilman.
Incoherent ramblings aside, I've done some research, and the female employment rate in government is abysmal.
The number one offender: Sanitation.
All right!
No, no, no, stop celebrating.
Why are there no female garbage collectors, Steve?
I don't know.
We hire women for other things.
You have one woman, and she's a secretary.
And she's the best secretary we got, except for Dan.
- Dan's awesome.
- Dan.
Garbage collectors make good wages, they have good benefits, and they are the smelly glue that keeps this city together.
You need to hire more women.
Not that many women apply, plus it's a very physically demanding job.
Your average woman can't handle it.
Oh, no?
Okay, so I took extensive notes on ways to maximize our efficiency, because we can't be just as good as the men.
We have to be better.
Yeah, you're totally right.
Let's rock this.
April, I love you, but I don't need your sarcasm right now.
I'm serious.
Let's get rolling.
I wanna get into some garbage.
What?
I love garbage.
You ever found a dead body in the trash?
Or body parts?
Like, a torso or a head?
Please say head.
Hey, Dewey.
Leslie brought binders.
What do they say?
"Pick up garbage.
Put in truck"?
Actually, yeah.
That's what's in the binder on every page because I believe in being thorough.
- All right.
- Okay.
Let's do it, trash people!
Whoo!
Let's feed the beast!
Here you are.
I had to search the directory for quite a while.
I thought your last name was Hanson for some reason.
No, it's Perkins.
Always has been.
You seem more like a Hanson.
Anyway, I have the girls again today, and they're asking to play with you.
Really?
I thought they hated me.
No, the opposite.
I don't know what you did to 'em, but it worked like gangbusters.
Or they do hate me, and you're just desperate and tired.
Either way, can you help me?
I'm out of activities, and they're playing with my land mine.
This thing's cool.
What are these things?
Let's play a word association game.
I'll say a word, and then you say the first thing that pops into your mind.
- Okay.
- You.
- Reporter.
- Me.
- City manager.
- Us.
Ooh!
Magazine.
Oh!
According to Leslie's binder, she and April are making even better time than the guys do on a normal day.
Wow, that's weird.
You know, with us being women and all, you'd think our boobs would get in the way.
Is that accurate Mr. Phlegner?
Is Councilwoman Knope ahead of the regular schedule for this route?
Whatever.
No comment.
- Tough stuff.
- Are you posing?
I don't have a photographer with me.
Google Earth Always taking pics.
Let's move it out!
All right, let's start with the basics.
Uh, why don't you just play some one-on-one, see if you can score?
Andy, guard him.
Eh, he's too big.
I can't see over him.
It's not fair.
I feel like everyone should be the same size.
Okay, you have to create space.
You gotta just dribble around him.
- There you go.
- Now what?
Shoot!
Shoot the ball.
Did I do basketball?
Kind of.
Try it again.
Tommy for the dunk!
My screen!
But it was actually a blood-hungry witch who was wearing their mom's face like a mask!
What is wrong with you, woman?
Sorry.
I thought kids liked ghost stories.
Hey, girls!
Did you wanna look through my nurse kit?
- Yeah!
- Ooh, check it out, bandages!
We can wrap up the dolls, and pretend they just had surgery.
- Yeah!
- Awesome!
Yeah, or we can use this hammer and test reflexes.
- Yeah!
- Here, Zoe, watch.
Do me!
Do me!
Do Princess Junebug now!
Okay.
You know what, Ron?
I can watch them for a little while, if you wanna Take a break.
This is Stacy Knoblauch's house.
I went to high school with her, and she was super mean to me, and now I know that she dyes her hair.
I knew that wench wasn't naturally blonde.
Oh, my God!
She has to use prescription-strength deodorant.
This is the best day of my life.
Hey, ladies, someone just called in a pickup.
We have to make an unscheduled stop.
Hope you can handle it.
- It's not in the binders.
- A new challenge?
Bring it on, Stevie boy.
Whoo!
April, let's finish up!
We have some stereotypes to overcome.
And some privacy to violate!
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
Wait, no.
- Oh!
- Yes!
- Nothin' but net.
- Nice!
You are officially a baller.
I've been a baller since birth, son.
Now, I'm an athlete.
Hey!
You little chumps wanna play some ball?
- Sure.
- Let's do this.
Watch out.
Tommy from half court.
This could really only go poorly.
- He won't get out of my way!
- Tom-- Oh, my God!
- Yeah!
- Yes!
Tom, what the hell are you doing?
I'm pivoting.
Ben told me to pivot.
I told you you can pivot, not that you can only pivot.
Stop pivoting!
All right, that's illegal.
I may not know much, but you can't just steal the ball from another player.
Hey, aren't you the guy who owns Rent-A-Swag?
- Yeah!
Tom Haverford.
- You suck at basketball, man.
Well, you suck at being polite, sir.
This has been fun, but we have an actual game tomorrow against guys who can actually play.
Let's go.
Andy Dwyer for the dunk!
Aw, that wall's so close.
Doctors, the operation is now complete.
Doctor Zoe, could you please use the reflex hammer to see if she's okay?
This is the most fun I have ever had with kids.
They even said they wanted to be doctors when they grow up.
Hot tip for you baby-sitters out there.
Let your kids play with medical tools all the time.
- We have a problem.
- What?
Oh, my God.
Girls!
This is not a negotiation.
- Unlock the door immediately.
- No!
We're doing surgery!
Only doctors are allowed in here.
Okay.
Stand back, ladies!
Ron, no, no, no, no!
That's dangerous!
Somebody in here's gotta have keys, right?
I have keys.
Wha-- Jerry.
I never thought I would say this, but I am so glad you're here.
Well, it's gotta be one of these, right?
- Oh, no.
- Ladies, no, no, no, no, no!
The patient needs a haircut.
Her hair is infected.
- Hurry, Jerry!
- Okay, I'm trying.
- It's not this one.
- No.
Okay, I'm not good under pressure like this.
Zoe, stop it, please!
- No!
- Zoe, put the scissors down.
Oh!
No!
Bakery called this in.
Needs to go on that truck right there.
Ah, easy, breezy, beautiful.
That's the covergirl slogan.
I didn't mean to say that.
Okay, here we go!
On three!
- Okay.
- One, two, three, move it.
On four, five, six, here we go!
- You need a hand?
No, no, we don't need a hand.
What, you think Joan of Arc needed a hand?
- Doing what?
- Let me tell you something.
We are not leaving until this symbolic feminist obstacle is loaded onto that truck of women's advancement, and you can put that on the record, Shauna.
Well, you ladies clearly have everything in hand.
Dewey and I are gonna head back to base.
Hope we didn't throw you off schedule.
- Not at all.
- Have fun!
Hey, Shauna, maybe not put this part on the record.
You know, leave the earlier part on the record, but if we can't get this fridge onto the truck then maybe not put that on the record, and then just destroy the record altogether.
Okay, guys, I'm gonna go ahead and decide what's on and off the record on my own.
- Cool?
- Uhhuh.
The whole city is watching.
If I can't move that fridge onto that truck, then feminism is over in this town.
I don't know why I thought sneaking up on it would work.
This is the one.
This is-- Oh!
Why do you have so many keys?
We did surgery just like you taught us!
Okay, you know what?
Why don't you girls clean up all this hair, and I'm gonna talk to Ron.
- Let's cut off our toes!
- No, let's not.
I'm gonna take this bag, too.
You need to fix this.
It's not that bad.
Nobody got hurt.
It's extremely bad!
I love this woman, and I just wanna show her that I'm capable of watching her children without something horrible happening.
What?
Did you just say you love Diane?
No.
I did not.
Yes, you did!
That is so cute!
For God's sake, Hanson, will you please focus on the larger problem?
Ron loves Mommy!
Ron loves Mommy!
Girls, girls, I don't know what you think you heard, but please don't tell your mother what you incorrectly think you heard.
- Ron loves-- Mommy!
Ron loves Mommy!
I love nothing!
I'm gonna have to start writing this up soon.
Kinda sucks.
I thought maybe we'd be done in time - to grab a drink.
- Oh!
Have you been to Bistro d'Amour?
- It's really romantic.
- Ooh.
Yeah, it was just gonna be you and me, my sister, a few people from work, and my ex-boyfriend.
That's really confusing.
I have a request.
Could you please make sure that my involvement in this stays off the record?
I wouldn't want anyone thinking that you're biased because we're something.
You don't have to worry about that.
I'm gonna include a disclaimer describing the nature of our relationship.
I guess I'll have to wait for tomorrow's paper to find out our status.
Why did I have to fall for somebody from the old media?
Maybe we should just eat the refrigerator.
We start chewing now, we can finish before the sun comes up.
We have to solve this problem, or they are going to point to this forever as a reason to not hire women.
I should never have taken the bait.
It was just such tasty, righteously-flavored bait.
You here to move the fridge?
- Are you a ghost?
- Yes, we are.
Why you think you can lift it?
You are two little canaries.
Those garbagemen couldn't even lift it.
They are like giant bears.
Hold on.
What do you mean?
Bears are bigger than canaries, yes?
So if bears can't lift the-- No, I understand animal sizes.
What do you mean they couldn't lift it?
They tried three days ago, and it does not budge.
They say they're gonna come back with more guys, but they come back with canaries.
Fly away, little canaries.
Those Sanitation goons set us up.
You know what?
Let's just go.
What?
No!
We can't let them beat us.
Just call it a tie.
Nobody can lift it.
No, Leslie, we do not want to tie.
We want to win.
Those guys suck, okay?
We have to prove them wrong.
Look, all we have to do is get some PCP.
You can move anything on angel dust.
My cousin Hesen, he beat off five cops on that stuff.
Okay, hold on.
Sir!
Does this refrigerator still work?
Works okay.
We got a new one.
We don't need it.
So what if those kids think you're the lamest guy in the world?
That's not who you want shopping at Rent-A-Swag anyways, Tom.
That's exactly who I want shopping at Rent-A-Swag.
Oh, well, then, that sucks.
Look, I wanna show you something.
Okay, this is Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook after a bad loss.
Even the greats get beat, but they get back out there the next day, and they fight.
So let's hit the gym again tomorrow.
Guys, I think I just dribbled up an idea.
No, double dribbled it.
Yeah, you have learned nothing about basketball.
You're a good friend, Ben.
Oh, thanks.
Can I borrow $1,500?
You're not allowed to ask what it's for.
Fireworks.
First of all, everyone is fine.
No one got hurt, but there was an incident.
Oh, my God.
What happened?
Diane, this is all my fault.
I let them go into my nurse's bag.
Well, who has been having fun with scissors?
Us!
Ann taught us how to be doctors!
- Yay!
- You're not mad?
No, it's fine.
They're kids.
Once, Zoe put Ivy in the dryer, so I'm still incredibly sorry.
I feel like I let you down.
It is so sweet to me how much you care.
This is why I love you.
Oh.
Well, I love you, too.
That's my cue.
All right, girls, good hang.
- Bye, Ann!
- Thanks, Ann.
Oh.
Hey, Leslie!
Shauna just sent me the disclaimer that she's gonna use before she prints the article.
"City manager Chris Traeger "was present for this event, and has a personal relationship with the author".
Okay, that's pretty good, right?
"Personal relationship".
It's not romantic.
But it is descriptive.
No, it's not even descriptive.
I know you're not used to this, but maybe you should just try to keep it chill and see what happens.
Great advice.
Impossible to follow, but great advice.
So do you think the soup kitchen could use that fridge?
I mean, April and I were gonna haul it onto the truck effortlessly, but if you need it Absolutely.
This is a godsend.
Thank you for thinking of us.
Grab a side, ladies.
I think all of us can get it on the truck.
Not only did we complete the garbage route and move an unmovable fridge, but the Sanitation department hired three new female trash-haulers.
And, best of all, April gave me this present to commemorate our feminist victory.
And it's trash.
It's filled with trash.
Maybe there's something on the bottom here.
Let me see-- No, just trash.
This is Brandon Turnbill for Kids' 46 News.
I'm here with the star of today's win, Josh Diamond.
What was the key to the victory, Josh?
Well, uh, everything just came together for us, and we came out on top, and we're gonna try to keep it going next week against Snerling.
Thanks, tiny reporter.
It was a huge win for Josh and the boys, and after a huge win, be sure to visit Rent-A-Swag on Durham Avenue for all your post-game press conference fashion rental needs.
We've got everything: Dope suits, pocket squares, Gingham shirts, glasses with no lenses, Tiny cardigans, Fedoras Look at this watch!
Whatever swag you need, You can rent at Rent-A-Swag.
Now, that's basketball.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
I'm gonna get 12 eggs and part of a dead animal.
Dealer's choice.
Please and thank you.
What can I get you, Ann?
I will have oatmeal and berries.
And I will have catfish and grits, with pumpernickel toast.
Explain.
Well, instead of getting swept up in my boyfriends' personalities, I am dating myself and trying new things.
So every time I go out to eat, I order one thing that's typical me and then something that I would never order.
Now I have two best friends, Ann and Ann.
Each one more beautiful than the other.
Oh, I also have been documenting all the new things I'm trying on my blog.
Check this out.
I went skydiving.
Which Ann is screaming like a maniac?
Oatmeal Ann or catfish Ann?
I'm not sure, because I instantly blacked out from extreme terror.
Hey, I have an idea for your blog.
I think you should take yourself ice-skating.
That sounds fun.
Yeah, we'll do a double date: You and you, and me and Ben.
But I have to warn you, I'm very good at ice-skating.
I can do jumps.
You know what?
I probably shouldn't come.
I'll embarrass the both of you.
Actually, I know what my next activity is gonna be.
And it's a biggie.
I want to be a mom.
I'm going to the sperm bank today.
Can you come?
Wow, today?
Ann, you know that I fully support any woman's decision-- especially a beautiful unicorn-nurse like yourself-- in creating the family that she wants.
But you are so brilliant and kind and stupid hot.
I mean, you're definitely gonna find a wonderful guy who loves you and respects you and fills your home with multi-ethnic genius babies.
Maybe, or maybe not.
You hit the lottery with Ben, and that's great, but not everybody's so lucky.
I've wanted to be a mom for a long time, I'm ready, and I think I'd be good at it.
Ann is giving up on love and deciding to have a baby with herself.
And she has only been dating herself for six weeks.
If she were dating a guy for six weeks, and they decided to have a kid, I'd be like, "Congratulations, Ann And Channing Tatum".
Because that is the only scenario that would make sense to me.
What a gorgeous herbaceous medley.
There's been a mistake.
You've accidentally given me the food that my food eats.
Salad is traditionally the first course at a wedding.
Is a gerbil marrying a rabbit?
I'm in charge of food for the wedding.
So I brought in Pawnee's three best caterers and a panel of experts.
Chris loves vegetables.
Ron loves meat.
And Tom considers himself a foodie, which apparently means taking instagrams of food instead of eating it.
Okay, so I liked number one, Chris liked number two, and Ron liked number three.
Tom, what about you?
Caterer number one's presentation was simple, mm, yet exhausting.
Number two's was subtle and provocative, like a coy Dutch woman guarding a dark secret.
Nothing you're saying is helpful.
But number three's told a story-- a story from a book I wouldn't read but I would watch the movie of.
That's nonsense.
You know what?
I'm gonna go with the first place.
I really loved that appetizer.
Oh, the mini-calzone?
I wouldn't call it that.
It was more like a savory pastry.
Delicate little dough pocket filled with tomato sauce, cheese, and seasoned meat.
Just a stunning culinary innovation.
It was a calzone.
It was literally just a small calzone.
Let me just get some details for your file.
Now, are you two a couple?
No.
Tragically, we are both heterosexual.
So, Ann, what are you looking for in particular?
Some sperm.
I meant in terms of a donor?
Oh, you know, nice guy Nice sperm.
Flip through this binder, make a note of anyone who interests you, and I'll be back shortly.
Oh!
This guy went to Harvard!
So did the Unabomber.
This guys seems healthy.
Loves cycling.
Yeah, so did Lance Armstrong, and he turned out to be a lying drug user.
Or a hero.
I don't know where we stand on him now.
Hello, ladies.
Fancy meeting you here.
Whoa, Sewage Joe.
Wow.
Ann, you remember Joe Fantringham.
He is the gentleman who was fired for emailing a picture of his penis to every woman in city hall.
Guilty.
Yeah, that's what the judge said.
- Mmhmm.
- Joe, you are a donor here, huh?
Did you hear that, Ann?
Big time, me and all my buddies.
Free money, free porn.
Best job I ever had.
Also If you're looking to buy some weed, I'm looking as well.
- Shall we?
- Yup.
Okay, Leslie Knope outfit number eight.
Babe, you look super hot.
You realize you've said that about all of them?
Well, she has, every single time.
'Cause she is super hot.
Honestly, you'd look hot naked.
Ugh.
This suit makes me want to scold a Catholic child.
I don't know who Ann Taylor is, but I hate her and I want to kill her.
I have to lead a public forum for the Pawnee Commons every day this week, and I hate talking to people.
So, to get through it, I figured I'm just gonna basically try to imitate Leslie.
She still wears this.
She had the patch sewn in.
You can't remove it.
What's in the pocket, you ask?
A ticket stub from a Fleetwood Mac concert in 1995, and This one is terrible, but it is slightly less terrible than the rest.
So tomorrow, I lead a public forum in Leslie's Fleetwood Mac sex pants.
Fleetwood Mac Sex Pants.
New band name.
I call it.
Ooh, you know what?
Maybe just Fleetwood Mac.
So what's the next move?
Is there, like, a better sperm bank in Eagleton or something?
Um, you don't want a demon baby.
Look, you're Ann Perkins.
Sperm that is worthy of your perfect eggs does not grow on trees.
I think, ideally, you'd want to know the guy, right?
You'd want to know his personality, his favorite season of Friends, whether or not he hates jazz-- hopefully, he does.
You'd want to know him.
Yes, Leslie, you're totally right.
I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna make a list of all the guys I already know who could be donors.
And then, I'm gonna call them and tell them I'm doing some blog entry on men's health or something.
I can interview them and ask them whatever I want.
You're a genius!
This is your idea, and I love it.
I'll call you later.
No.
If I don't slow this baby train down, Ann may end up having a baby with some random weirdo instead of her soul mate.
I fully believe that a woman should be in charge of what happens to her body.
In this case, the body is Ann's, and the woman in charge of it is me.
I was up all night brainstorming and this is the complete official list of candidates for Ann's baby daddy.
Wow, how did you come up with these three names?
Well, I eliminated everyone in a relationship and the obvious "No" s, like Knuckle-hair Dave from HR.
I don't mind the knuckle hair.
- I just think he's a dick.
- Yeah.
And I was left with those three guys.
Don't forget, they don't know about the sperm donor thing.
I don't want them to know.
I told them I was interviewing them for a blog.
Here comes the first one.
Dr. Harris!
- H-hey, there he is.
- Hi.
Ann, Leslie.
Small office.
Mine's way bigger.
Is this gonna take long?
Got a patient coming in.
No, not at all.
Please have a seat.
Actually, maybe you should check in on your patient.
I know that I hate it when my doctor makes me wait.
Guy's got a spinal fracture.
He's not going anywhere.
- Uh-huh.
- Ooh.
The seats in my office are leather.
Okay.
Chris?
I'm dying.
I was dying earlier today.
And then I died.
Now I'm dead.
I had to cancel a date with Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
And I really like her.
Do you think she'll still like me now that I'm dead?
What is this?
It's food poisoning.
I have it too.
I did not sleep for one second last night.
And I cracked the bottom of the toilet bowl.
Oh, God, don't say that.
Has anybody talked to Tom?
I can't even imagine what that tiny little man must be feeling like.
I have voided more than Tom's body weight in the last 12 hours alone.
He might have just disappeared off the earth.
We need to call him.
We must reach out to him.
I can't do it.
Ben, extension 7820.
Hello, everyone.
I'm April Ludgate from the Parks Department.
And welcome to a public forum about the Pawnee Commons.
As Eleanor Roosevelt once said to Betty Ford "Hillary Clinton is great".
Now, if you all would kindly look under your chairs, you will find a special surprise-- a flyer with details about the project, and Friendship bands that I've made for each and every one of you.
So now, I guess we're Park Pals.
You should see the booger under this chair.
Andy.
It's nice to see you again, Ann.
I was happy to get the call.
- Yeah, Pete, you look great.
- Aww.
So are you still dunking basketballs?
You know, I'm a lot more than just a former high school basketball star.
I teach marketing over at Pawnee Community College.
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.
Would you say you value education?
I see what's going on here.
You want my sperm.
What?
What are you talking about?
When will women in this town stop scheming to get my sperm?
Wow.
That son of a bitch is astute.
Okay, all I need to do is just shoot one more person down and then I can buy some time and convince Ann to wait for her own Ben-level soul mate.
The last guy is Howard Tuttleman.
I know that name.
How do I know that name?
I know it's a winter's morn, but it feels like a summer's eve, 'cause "the douche" is in the building.
What's up, ladies?
Oh, whoa!
Smells like some vomit took a dump in here.
What happened?
We got food poisoning, Tom.
Yuck.
How do you not have food poisoning?
Because he didn't eat anything.
He just took pictures and talked about the "wow" factor.
Not true.
I ate everything you did.
Are you sure?
Is there anything that you didn't eat?
Oh, yeah.
I didn't eat those stupid mini-calzones.
Haver-food rule number six-- never eat anything with a sauce I have to dip myself.
Drizzle it on for me.
I'm not your maid.
The calzones betrayed me?
Never again, guys.
As God as my witness, they're dead to me.
All right, well, Tommy feels great.
And I'm about to go eat some lasagna.
Peace!
I'm afraid this park will raise my taxes.
Ah, well, fear not.
Between the normal Parks budget and our corporate partners-- - I'm also afraid the park will be noisy.
And full of spiders.
And dark at nighttime.
I'm scared of a lot of stuff.
Everything's fine.
I'm fine.
I'm Walter, and I'm fine.
Is this gonna be a topless park?
I don't think there are topless parks.
Well, let's build the first one and be heroes.
If this is going to be a topless park, I won't sign your petition.
If she's going to the topless park, I'm not signing the topless park petition.
You know, I take that back, I'm still in.
What's up?
I'm Harris.
Yeah, yeah.
Forget whatever that Pawnee Commons is.
I'm with that pervert.
Topless park.
Topless park!
- Topless park!
- Topless park!
Where'd you go to school again?
Northwestern.
I studied semiotics.
Wrote a thesis on narrative forms in the digital world.
Then you became a morning shock-jock and created the sport "taint ball"?
Yeah.
You know, the douche persona is something I came up with during college.
It started as satire, and, you know, we snowballed to where we are today.
I mean, I know it's a silly thing to do, but it pays the bills.
Well, I think, you probably need to get back to the studio, play some fart jokes, make fun of some immigrants.
Actually, a farting immigrant segment would be really funny.
Ay dios Good looking out, Leslie.
You guys ever want to do this again, sans clothing, give me a shout.
- Gross.
- That was the douche talking.
Honestly, good luck on this project.
It sounds really interesting.
I'm gonna scan a quick pic of them boobies for a little deposit in "El banco de spanko".
That was the douche talking.
Douche nation.
You guys know where the library is?
Wow.
Okay, that's not gonna work.
Back to the drawing board.
No need.
I choose Howard.
You want to have a baby with the douche?
His name's Howard Tuttleman, Leslie.
And I know he plays that obnoxious character on the radio, but he's a good guy, his family is healthy, and he is successful and smart.
Ann, you cannot be serious.
I am.
And I've made my decision.
- I am sure of it.
Okay.
Douche!
Hey, douche!
Councilman Howser.
Councilwoman Knope.
'Sup, Leslie?
You wanna funk this junk in the back of my trunk?
That was the douche talking.
Okay, look, Ann is not interviewing you for her blog.
She's thinking about having a baby, and she's considering you as a possible donor.
Wow.
You know, I've thought a lot about having kids.
It's the next big step in this grand adventure that we call life.
Frankly, I don't think you would be the right man for the job.
Well, frankly, I don't think it's for you to decide.
You know, if we had a little girl, I would name her Elizabeth, after my grandmother.
She was this strong, amazing woman.
And if we had a boy, I don't know, I'd name him something funny, like "Dick" or "O.
J." Guess I have a lot to consider.
My God.
I have driven Ann right into the belly of the douche.
- Hey, what's up?
- Oh, nothing.
I was listening to the radio on my way here, and I heard something very interesting.
So, Crazy Ira, remember that chick Ann I used to Yeah, she was smoking hot!
Turns out, she wants to have my baby.
Anyway, her lesbo friend tells me she's on the prowl for some baby beans And it's down to me and some other turd-munchers.
Wow.
You should be angry.
I can't believe Howard did that to you.
I can't believe you did that to me.
I am making a very important life decision, and you betrayed me.
Because I thought you were making a huge mistake.
Look, I get it.
I know you're frustrated with dating, and you think you're not gonna meet someone, but two years ago, I didn't think I would meet someone like Ben, and I did.
My idea of a perfect family does not require a soul mate.
I want a baby, that's it, accept it.
Councilman Milton, do we have a meeting?
Oh, no, no, no.
I just wanted to toss my name into the ring, in respect to this Indian woman's vagina.
Hey, how was the forum?
Um, crappy.
We only got four signatures.
Two of them were me and Andy, and one of them said "Farts McCool".
I just don't know how Leslie can be Leslie all the time.
I was her for two hours and I want to die.
Well, you know what?
We've got another forum today.
Let's just hop back in that saddle.
What should I do?
Should I wear a blonde wig?
Oh, my God, yes.
- That would be so hot.
- Andy.
If you think--if you-- do you think it would help?
I mean, if you think it'd help you.
Well, I'm feeling so much better.
Almost no weird stuff snuck out of my body last night.
And I feel like the emptiness of my stomach is gonna lead to a pretty epic breakfast.
Guys, what do I do?
My choice almost killed us, and we can't agree on another one, so-- Maybe there's a catering company in Snerling that we should look into.
No, it has to be from Pawnee.
I just know that's what Leslie wants.
I got it.
This might sound crazy, but Jean-Ralphio has started a catering company.
He has?
Now, granted, he is currently standing trial for counterfeiting Euros, but the trial's gonna be over quick.
He's definitely guilty.
Ugh, forget it.
Dry toast and half a grapefruit for Chris.
Thank you.
- Egg whites for Ben.
- Thank you.
Egg whites for Tom, and pretty much everything we make for Ron.
And don't you go sneaking off.
I'm sending home some free waffles for Leslie.
Thanks, JJ.
You're the best.
Okay, we're back.
We, uh, got an update on "Operation Baby douche".
All right, special guest is Councilwoman Leslie Knope.
- How are you, les?
- "Me so horny".
That was not me.
That was a farcical sound effect.
Did she say "fartsicle"?
The fartsicle.
Frozen farts you can eat.
Put it in your face-mouth!
It's cold and it smells.
God, how did you make that so fast?
Anyway, look, I am here because I want you to stop talking about my friend's womb.
Sorry, Councilwoman.
I'm in it to win it.
The douche is gonna be a daddy.
And Crazy Ira's gonna be the creepy Uncle.
Okay, all right.
Look, she is a wonderful person, and she does not deserve this.
So I need you to lay off.
Okay, I will lay off if you can survive one round with Breasty Bertha in The Jell-o Pit!
Rudy!
Get in the Jell-o.
Okay, I am a city councilwoman, so I am not gonna Jell-o wrestle.
I mean, this is fun.
Don't you want your constituents to know that you got a fun side?
Yeah, show your fun sides.
This is not about me and my constituents!
This is about you talking about my friend.
All right, I will stop talking about your friend if you get in that Jell-o for one second - and say, "Rudy".
- Rudy.
- 'Cause The Cosby Show.
- Classic.
Classic.
Fine, I will stand there for one second and say it, and then we're done.
- Fair's fair.
- Fair's fair.
Somebody get me a pudding pop.
Oh!
Yeah!
Rudy.
There, happy?
No, say it like Bill Cosby.
Rudy.
- I don't know.
- Yeah!
Oh, she's touching her boobs now.
No, I'm not.
I'm just standing here.
And I am leaving, just like you're gonna leave Ann alone.
Oh, she's in there!
She's into it now!
Oh, Rudy has fallen into the Jell-o.
Theo, now there's Jell-o all over my favorite sweater.
And the gold medal goes to Leslie Knope!
Okay, can you give me that bag?
I have to go change into my Leslie suit.
You got it, babe.
Thanks.
Andy!
- What?
- This is the wrong bag.
What?
This bag is full of Fruit Roll-Ups and baseball cards.
I don't have my Leslie pantsuit or my Leslie headband or my Leslie notes.
I can't do this meeting without my Leslie stuff.
- Honey, I am so sorry.
- Andy!
I guess I must have screwed up.
Look, you look amazing in this outfit.
Plus you're the smartest person on the planet.
I think you can do this just being yourself.
Yeah, so how much money is this whole Pawnee Commons project gonna cost me?
Uh, good question.
from our corporate partners, - and another 30%-- - Excuse me, ma'am.
I didn't ask for a math lesson.
So why don't you just tell me how much it's gonna cost me?
And don't use numbers.
Look, you won't have to pay any extra money, okay?
And don't ever call me "ma'am" again.
Thanks.
Next question.
Yeah, I wanted to talk more about that topless park idea that a local hero brought up yesterday.
Yeah, there's not gonna be a topless park, Harris.
Nobody wants your creepy stoner eyes staring at them while they're enjoying a park, okay?
Stop being gross.
Yeah.
Shut me down!
You scare me, and I gotta say, I kinda dig that.
What's your deal?
She's married to me.
I heard you on the radio.
- Thanks for doing that.
- Got dicey.
But they did invite me to participate in their topless Jell-o-lympics - Oh.
- So that's something.
It is possible that you were right.
This is obviously a huge decision, and I should take my time.
I want you to be happy, you know?
I-I guess I just didn't consider that you would take a different path than I did.
I tried to impose my dream on you, and that's wrong.
And I'm sorry.
But I think you do need to take a little bit more time with this decision.
Maybe employ a more methodical approach.
One that involves color-coded binders.
Is that a drawing of my reproductive system saying "Let's do this"?
The Knope way involves a lot of uterine cartoons.
What can I tell you?
Besides, what is more cuter-us than your uterus?
- You ready, Ann?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- We're in it now.
- Yes, we are.
Let's make a baby together.
You should phrase that differently.
Right.
Are you sure you're cool with JJ's Diner catering what you've referred to as "The wedding of the millennium"?
Are you kidding me?
I thought that I could not love you any more than I already did.
But I was dead wrong.
- Is that smoke?
- Hmm?
- Hey!
What are you doing?
- Celebrating.
We got 80 signatures and, like, 30 complaints of excessive rudeness, but who cares?
Yeah, you should have seen her, Leslie.
She was awesome.
So smart, so hot, so mean.
I wanted to bone her right there in that dirty church basement.
No, what are you doing?
Uh, we are burning this awful pantsuit.
That's mine.
I wanted that back.
Well, frankly, you should have thought of that before we burned it.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
If I could sum up the Pawnee Commons in one word, it would be: Dynamite.
"Dynamite" stands for daring, youth-friendly, natural, amazing, merry, inviting, tourist attraction-y, and eco-friendly.
Thank you, Councilwoman Knope-- very, very thorough - and so many acronyms.
- I know.
Councilman Jamm?
Thank you, Bill.
No, please, everyone be seated.
Let the record show there was a standing ovation.
- No, there wasn't.
- There was not.
History will decide.
My plan for lot 48 is simple.
But why read it when you can shove it right in your face?
I want to sell this lot to Paunch Burger.
Here's why.
We make money.
They make money.
They make burgers.
We eat burgers.
Mmhmm.
That's a win-win-win-win.
Presentation over.
Jamm out.
Oh, man.
Are there curly fries?
I love their curly fries.
Ann.
Well, the planning commission has a week to decide if they want a beautiful, innovative community park or a bunch of greasy lard bombs.
I'm not editorializing.
Paunch Burger's number-one-selling burger is the greasy lard bomb.
Just give me a hint as to which way you guys are leaning.
Off the record?
We're leaning towards Jamm.
Why?
You know my plan is better for the community.
Oh, it's way better, but you're also short $50,000.
We can't approve an underfunded project.
Hey, get the rest of the money, you get your park.
You only have a week.
What are we going to do, guys?
How are we going to get that money?
Hey, come on.
Cheer up, little pups.
Registering for your wedding is the most important moment of your lives.
Love-- love fades away.
But things - Things are forever.
- That's beautiful.
Did the Dalai Lama say that?
Ooh!
A citrus reamer!
Oh, this is the only way to ream citrus.
You're gonna need two of these.
I don't want a citrus reamer.
I don't want any of this stuff.
Look, all I want is to be married to you and to somehow get $50,000.
Hey, hang on.
What if we register for the park instead of the stuff?
We could organize a black-tie gala with food and music and maybe a silent auction to raise money.
Yeah, and people could donate, or they could bid to put their names on everything in the park, like benches, cobblestones, trees, ants, air.
Right, some of that is possible.
- You are a genius.
Let's go.
- Okay.
Hey, guys.
I'm really feeling these sheets--very cozy.
I just want to say thank you for all your hard work this week.
Give yourselves a hand.
But your applause is premature.
You just told us to applaud.
Well, if I told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?
I hope so, because the only way that this gala is going to happen is if you do everything I say.
Tom, I need you to contact three more food vendors on this list, and they need to do it for free.
I'm omelet.
Get it?
"I'm on it," "I'm omelet"?
I get it, and I love it, but I don't have time for food puns right now.
Okay, I'm heading out.
Good-pie.
Go.
Gurt.
Go-gurt.
I'm incredible.
See you guys.
Okay.
Donna, Jerry-- Leslie!
Leslie, we need you back at the command center right now!
We have a class-one city emergency.
Oh, my God.
Gayle.
My girls!
What's the emergency?
Oh, this is just a drill, but I am having so much fun pretending it's real.
Are you kidding me?
The disaster-preparedness people picked today?
Each year every city in Indiana is reviewed by the Department of Emergency Preparedness.
And Pawnee has failed On last year's report, they stated, "Every time it so much as drizzles in Pawnee, "the town is in danger of collapsing into Thunderdome-style, post-apocalyptic mayhem".
Okay, we don't know how long Leslie's going to be gone, so let's just knock some of this stuff off.
Should someone stop Jerry?
Gayle!
Eh, he'll figure it out eventually.
First, we do the written exam, and then we do the personality evaluation, which I feel like I'm gonna nail, 'cause people always say, "But he's got a great personality".
Okay, quiz me.
Okay, what does it mean when an officer calls in a 3542?
Assault and battery.
The way I remember that, I picture 35 a-salt shakers and 42 batteries.
Great.
What is the criminal code for arson?
Arson is 533.
You know how I remember that?
I picture 533 salt shakers and batteries lighting a building on fire.
Oh, I'm nervous.
Babe, look at me.
You are going to pass this test, and you are going to become a cop.
And if you don't, I'll just divorce you and marry someone else and then cheat on them with you.
Aw, that's so sweet.
Also, I got you a lucky charm.
I found a dead rabbit on the side of the road, and I cut its feet off and made it into a lucky charm.
Baby, you are so creepy.
Thank you.
I love it.
Dwyer, you're up.
My name is Leonard Tchulm.
I'm head of the Indiana Department of Emergency Preparedness.
And today I'm going to bring death and destruction to your town.
I am Leslie Knope.
I am the Pawnee Emergency Czar.
And this year, we are more than prepared for your test, but, um, it just so happens, today is a little inconvenient.
Good, because the best day for a drill is when it's inconvenient for everyone.
My mother is getting a colonoscopy today.
I'm not even sure there's anyone there to drive her home, so we're all making sacrifices, Ms. Knope.
Well, I'm very sorry to hear about your mother.
Mm, we're not that close.
Oh.
Good.
Okay, volunteer victims, please put your identification placards on now and go to your designated areas throughout town.
First Responders, return to your stations, and the simulation begins N-n-n Went past the zero.
I got to wait till it goes Okay, now.
All right, officers, bolt the doors.
We are officially in lockdown mode.
The doors will not open until Leonard announces that this drill is complete.
The most important event that I have ever organized in my entire life is happening in eight hours, and I am stuck in this room.
This is a nightmare.
Wait.
Maybe this is a nightmare.
Nope, can't fly away.
This is real life.
And now, I'm going to open one of these ten envelopes at random to determine your simulated disaster.
Pawnee has been hit by A strain of avian flu.
Yes!
Avian flu!
Jackpot.
This is a simple one, guys.
Everybody open their binders, okay?
- "The Knope Protocol"?
- Uh, correction.
That's "Mission Im-Pawnee-able: Knope Protocol".
Now, if everyone just follows my instructions, we will ace this test, and we will be done in 90 minutes.
"Step one-- insert the DVD scenario".
Hmm, what could be on this?
Good evening, this is Channel 4 lead anchor Willow Tremaine, with breaking news.
Avian flu has just hit the town of Pawnee.
We go live now to St. Joseph's Medical Center for an update.
Hello, my name is Donatella Breckinridge, M.D. I graduated first in my class from Harvard Medical School, so I know what I'm talking about.
This is the avian flu, or we call "H5N1".
Donna, are we on schedule for the tent setup?
The tables showed up, which is good, but there are no chairs, which is bad.
Okay, well, get some chairs from somewhere.
Great leadership-- inspiring.
Oh, God.
Leslie was gonna go on Pawnee Today - to promote the gala.
- I'll do it.
No offense, Ron, but I don't think you'd be great on TV.
I can speak in full sentences, and I won't cry.
Fair point.
I did cry last time.
Godspeed.
Mmm!
Smells amazing, Chef.
What you cooking?
Little coq au vin?
Little bouillabaisse?
You can stop the ass-kissing, Haverford.
I know why you're here.
I cannot do the gala.
It doesn't make business sense to cater something that big for free.
Please.
If the gala doesn't go perfectly, the lot could become a Paunch Burger.
Doesn't that offend your refined Parisian sensibilities?
I'm from Orlando.
And I don't care about the Paunch Burger.
If it was another French restaurant, maybe I'd worry.
Hey!
Well, you know what?
What?
What?
What you got for me?
Get out of my kitchen!
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.
Pardon!
Pardon!
Hey, can you hear me?
Oh!
Leslie, you on the TV!
Well, you're on mine, Brett.
- We're having a video conference.
- Oh, okay.
Pawnee has been hit with the avian flu.
- Tight.
- No, this is bad news.
I need everyone there at Animal Control to eradicate all the infected birds in town.
"Kill all birds".
- This is for the drill, right?
- Yes.
But I'm actually gonna kill these birds for real?
No.
No, just pretend.
Right.
So how do I kill 'em-- like, with a gun?
No.
I could fill up a bathtub and just drown 'em one at a time.
Okay, let's forget we ever talked.
Got it.
Kill 'em.
Okay, casualty update-- only four dead, two of whom were already gravely ill and brothers.
That family took a terrible hit.
Well, that's great news.
Not so fast.
I regret to inform you that someone in this room has begun exhibiting symptoms-- - Christopher Traeger.
- What?
A few months ago, the thought of an infectious disease, even hypothetical, would have sent me careening towards Bummerville, but now I am infected with a killer virus, and I feel fine.
Therapy!
This is highly irregular.
We have followed protocol to the letter.
No, you did not.
Unfortunately, no one contacted the transit department to shut down bus service.
So you rode a bus with a contagious man, and he infected you and 39 others.
That is impossible.
I do not ride the bus.
I ride my bicycle behind the bus as a windbreak.
Doesn't matter.
Prepare for the diarrhea.
Okay, who was supposed to deal with Transit?
My bad, guys.
That's my bad.
Chris, very sorry.
Damn it, Jamm.
I should've had animal control kill you.
- Oh, who you want me to kill?
- No one.
I'll kill him As soon as I'm done with these birds.
Hello.
I'm here for the interview about tonight's gala.
Yeah, listen, I'm a little under the weather.
I went on a booze cruise last week.
It just finished up an hour ago.
On a completely unrelated note, I have horrible allergies.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.
But I do need to promote this event.
Don't worry about me.
I'm a true professional.
The show must go on.
In five, four, three Two Hello.
I'm Joan Callamezzo.
Today's show will not go on.
It seems like her allergies are kicking in.
My name is Ron Swanson.
I am here to tell you about a black-tie gala fund-raiser for Pawnee Commons happening tonight.
All proceeds will go toward building a park.
It will be enjoyable.
Take a-- take a phone call.
Now I will take your calls, apparently.
Yes?
Hey, Joan, settle a bet for me.
Who's the sexiest couple in history?
R-Patz and K-Stew, or Bieber-- Hey, how's it going?
Uh, well, this simulated disaster is a total disaster.
How are you?
Ron subbed for you on Pawnee Today.
Ron who?
Ron Swanson?
On television?
You know we want people to come, right?
Donna still can't find any chairs.
We don't know where Jerry is.
And now some firemen are using the lot as a triage center for the emergency drill.
Okay, here's what you do.
Listen to me caref-- Attention.
Panic from the outbreak has overloaded cell phone towers.
Please deposit your phones into this box.
Oh, my God, this drill will never end.
- Okay, tell the firefighters - All phones.
To set up triage at the high school - All phones.
- And then to-- but I'm talking to someone important.
- All phones.
- Let me tell him something important.
Fix it, Ben!
Fix it!
Okay.
What?
I found one chair, got a lead on a second.
Keep me posted.
So this test will determine whether you have the right personality profile to be a police officer.
Just to make sure the machine is working, is your name Andy?
I don't know how to answer that.
- A simple "yes" or "no".
- Well, everyone calls me Andy, but my full name is Andrew, I think, so No?
Wait.
Yes.
Let's move on.
Scenario-- a high-school-aged child asks to hold your service revolver.
What do you do?
Yes, I give it to him.
When I was a kid, I always wanted to hold a cop's gun.
To make that dream come true for another kid-- Well, that's what being a cop is all about.
Scenario--you pull a car over for speeding.
You find out that it's your father.
- How do you handle the situation?
- Ooh.
Well, first, I would be like, "Dad "You're alive?
What the hell?
Also, do you know where my catcher's mitt is"?
Shouldn't you be taking her to lie down somewhere?
Oh, no.
If she ever found out that we took her off camera, we'd all be fired.
So just, uh, keep taking calls.
You're doing great.
Three, two Hello, again.
I'm Ron Swanson, and I am still taking your calls-- hopefully, about tonight's gala.
You're on the air.
Hi, uh, what's wrong with Joan?
She has a bad hangover, which she is pretending is allergies.
Is she gonna be okay?
Wouldn't know-- never been hungover.
After I've had too much whiskey, I cook myself a large flank steak, pan-fried in salted butter.
I eat that, put on a pair of wet socks, and go to sleep.
- That works?
- It does.
Please call now if you have questions about tonight's gala or one of my other interests-- Woodworking, uh, novels about tall ships, meat, that sort of thing.
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
"I, Chris Traeger, after several sustained hours of diarrhea, "combined with violent coughing and a devastating fever, "followed by even more diarrhea, have succumbed to the avian flu".
I'm dead.
I got to say, Leonard, it kind of feels like you're putting us through the ringer here.
Can you us an idea how long this is gonna take?
Uh Probably six to eight more hours.
- Eight more hours?
- Nine.
Are all state emergency drills this intensive?
Oh, no, hardly ever.
Councilman Jamm requested it.
Oh, really?
Specifically asked that the drill to be done today and said I should give you everything I got.
Mmhmm.
Guys!
Come here.
The game is rigged.
Jamm invited Leonard here, and he screwed up the bus thing on purpose to slow us down.
It is with a heavy heart that I say, "We have been jammed".
God, that guy is the worst!
Look, we are stuck in this room until the drill is over.
What are we gonna do?
The only thing we can do.
In order to save our park We have to destroy the entire town.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are making some changes to the Knope Protocol.
Ann, how much flu vaccine does the hospital still have?
Enough for 2,000 people.
Great.
Why don't you tell the hospital director - to flush them down the toilet.
- You got it.
Chief Fugleberg, I want you to order your officers to find all the infected birds in the area and perform CPR.
Sorry.
Won't they become infected?
That's a risk we're gonna have to take.
Our top priority is now saving all the birds.
And you know what?
Why don't we just kick this up a notch?
Oh, no!
Pawnee has been hit with A tornado quake!
This is Ron.
Go ahead, caller.
Hi.
My Yorkshire Terrier has chewed up the legs on my kitchen table.
Is there a cheap way to repair that?
Great question.
Take a walnut and rub it into the legs of your table.
That'll mask the scratches.
Next thing you want to do is ditch the Terrier and get yourself a proper dog.
Any dog under 50 pounds is a cat, and cats are pointless.
Come to the gala.
Next caller.
Grapes of Wrath, chocolate-chip ice cream, and Johnny Cash.
Don't trust big banks or small banks.
Banks are Ponzi schemes run by morons.
Your house isn't haunted.
You're lonely.
Whatever happened to, "Hey, I have some apples.
Would you like to buy them"?
"Yes, thank you".
That's as complicated as it should be to open a business in this country.
I've seen three movies in my life-- Bridge on the River Kwai, Patton, and Herbie Fully Loaded.
My girlfriend's kids love it.
It's pretty funny.
Next caller.
Good morning.
And it is a wrap.
Everyone in Pawnee is dead.
Including Councilman Jamm.
What?
No, no, you can't do that.
It says right there, you're dead, so is everyone you care about.
Oh, well, joke's on you.
I don't have anyone I care about.
Ms. Knope, I'm afraid I have to once again give Pawnee a failing grade.
This was bad-- Fort Wayne bad.
Bummer.
Thank you for your time.
I think we're done here.
I will see everyone at the gala, and I will see you in hell.
Yeah, you're too late, Knope.
That lot is mine.
I can't hear you.
I'm a ghost.
Yeah, well, so am I, so you can hear me!
Ghost jammed!
We got all the way to Muncie before we realized that it was just a drill.
I mean, all I'm saying is you could've called.
No one had your cell number, Big "J".
I find that hard to believe.
Oh, my God, why is everyone standing around?
We have work to do.
Status report.
- Status report!
- Well-- Nope, we don't have time for that.
We're gonna have to postpone the gala, but we can't, because the deadline is tomorrow.
Oh, my God, I destroyed the entire town for nothing.
Leslie, it's okay.
Oh, my God.
You did all this?
How did you get food?
I had a classic stroke of Haverford genius.
Who has the most to lose from a new Paunch Burger?
Their competitors.
I got all the other fast-food places in town to donate food.
I know black tie and chicky tenders isn't the best mix, - but-- - No, Tom, I love it.
And more importantly, so will all of our more ample citizens.
How did you get the word out?
Well, Ron went on Joan's show and kicked ass.
I also helped a child perform a tracheotomy on his elderly uncle.
It's been a very rewarding day.
Also, I told the firemen they should use the lot as triage and then gave them and all the dead and wounded - two free drink tickets.
- Wow.
This is great.
Thank you so much.
Let's start the gala.
Oh, and thanks for dressing up, Jerry.
- Hello, Chief Fugleberg.
- Hey.
That's your buddy Andy Dwyer over there, isn't it?
-Such a shame.
- Oh, no.
- Did he fail his test?
- It's weird.
He got 100% on his written test-- first guy in history to do it-- but he failed his personality examination.
He's a sweet kid-- just doesn't have what it takes to be a cop.
Oh, Andy.
Too bad.
He's certainly something of a genius.
We could use his brains on the force.
Official police wrist lock.
You can't hit me.
Try to hit me.
Or here, no, try-- it's this hand.
Wrist lock.
Boom, too much pain, you can't even hit me.
Try to hit me.
If I had my gun, you wouldn't try to hit me, though, is the thing.
Uh, if I could have everyone's attention please?
I am so happy to announce that as of one minute ago, we have reached our fund-raising goal.
Every dollar spent here tonight by you, the community, will be poured right back into this wonderful project.
And speaking of community, I'd like to thank my community-- my friends.
It's a lesson that I have learned over and over again, but it bears repeating-- No one achieves anything alone.
Without further ado, the best band in Pawnee-- Mouse Rat.
Park we will build it, the park it's not built yet, the park soon there will be a park Thank you.
Park I thought you should see why Leslie tanked the drill.
Councilman Jamm used you as a stalling tactic, hoping it would kill Leslie's park project.
If the test were any other day, Leslie would have aced it.
I believe you.
Maybe I'll find my way back here in a month for a re-do.
I appreciate it.
Have you ever thought of being a sperm donor?
I'm impotent.
Yeah, I don't need to know that.
This is the best wedding present ever.
This is the best night ever.
I wish we were getting married tonight.
Well, we only have three more months.
I can't wait three more months.
God, I just hate the feeling of not being married to you.
Well Let's just do it, then.
Let's get married Here, tonight.
I mean, we're all in black tie.
We've got plenty of food and entertainment And you did want to invite the whole town to the wedding, right?
Leslie Let's get married Tonight.
_ Breaking news-- I've just been handed this.
Pawnee has been hit by a devastating earthquake.
We go to our reporter, live, Winnifred Makepiece, for the story.
Winnifred?
Thanks, Jessica.
I'm here at the Pawnee Weather Center with celebrated geologist Isabella Winchester.
Isabella, can you tell us more about this killer earthquake?
That's right, Winnifred, the earthquake registered an 8.5 on the Richter scale.
That's correct.
It was a large one.
Thank you so much, everyone.
From all of us here at Channel 4 News, I'm Jessica Rabrit.
Have a good evening and be safe out there.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
_ This is the best night ever.
I wish we were getting married tonight.
Let's just do it then.
Leslie Let's get married.
Tonight.
- Are we really doing this?
- I gue-- Why not?
The gala ends at 11:00.
At 11:01, we get married.
Okay But, wait, my mom isn't here.
- And your parents aren't here.
- Good.
Yeah, that makes it better.
But we reserved a space for May 16th.
And we just ordered - We did?
- You did, actually.
It's under your name.
Leslie, we can get married May 16th, or June 1st, or July 57th.
But doesn't it feel right, today?
Yeah, it does.
Every time you say it, it just feels more right.
Oh, my God, we're getting married tonight.
- This is really great.
- Yeah.
You're either in or your out, buddy.
Iit was my idea, I'm totally in.
Wait, no.
We can't-- this is our wedding day.
This is very bad luck, turn around.
We can't look at each other!
Well, you are aware that we've seen each other several times today.
We have two hours to do this.
I want you to get everyone together, and meet me at Ann's house in ten minutes.
Okay.
Oh, wait, before we get married, there is something we need to discuss.
I mean, we've never talked about it, but I really want you to take my last name.
Oh!
Oh.
Okay.
Really?
Yeah, it's just really important to me, symbolically, that Leslie Knope disappears and becomes Leslie Wyatt.
Or Councilwoman Mrs. Ben Wyatt.
That's fine too.
It's a deal breaker.
Wait, are you messing with me?
Sorry, I had to give it a shot.
Ben, now go, run!
Okay, okay.
Wait.
Where do I go?
Run!
The falcon is entering!
The turtledove acknowledges!
Hey, where are you?
I'm-I'm here.
Okay, let's go over the duties right now.
Ann, you're in charge of the dress and the hair and the makeup.
And I was thinking, like, the sensuality of Eleanor Roosevelt combined with the animal magnetism of Lesley Stahl.
Piece of cake.
Oh, we have to get the wedding cake.
I'll do that too.
I'm perfectly calm.
I feel like every crazy thing Leslie's ever had me do has been, like a drill, and today is the real thing.
I'm ready, because I had the greatest teacher in the world.
Leslie.
Who is crazy.
Also, we need rings and marriage licenses.
Oh, let me be on rings.
I love what they symbolize.
- Great.
- And I can do the license.
I got a guy that works at City Hall.
That guy's my wife.
- Um, you also work there.
- Oh, yeah.
Ron, I'm gonna need you to walk me down the aisle.
It would be an honor, and the first time I won't regret walking down the aisle.
Oh, uh, yikes.
- We need an officiant.
- I got this.
You can become an ordained minister online in, like, five minutes.
Do you want more like a Steve Harvey vibe or straight-up Seacrest?
Nuh!
Never mind.
I'll combine 'em-- Steve-crest.
Okay, and, um, Jerry and Donna, I need you guys to just make sure that the gala runs smoothly.
Let's say that we're all gonna meet back here in an hour.
I love all of you.
One, two, three, break!
Excuse me.
We're looking for a couple wedding rings.
You're gonna wanna look through the jewelry and nails tray.
There is some beautiful jewelry in here.
But be careful.
There's also nails.
Oh!
Oh, these aren't bad.
Those are real nice.
And they were nipple rings, at one point.
How do you know that?
- Mm.
- They were yours.
They were his.
Let's go.
Hey, it's pretty crazy, I'm gonna be a cop tomorrow.
I guess I better commit as many crimes as possible tonight.
Get it out of my system.
Ooh, found the marriage licenses.
And I am going to take all of them.
I don't want anyone else in this town to get married, because it makes it less special for us.
Good call, babe.
- Let's roll.
- Okay.
I'm good!
It's not finished.
Why didn't the seamstress finish it?
If you're not gonna finish something three months early, then don't accept the job.
There's got to be something we can do.
This wedding is meant to be.
We're gonna figure it out.
Now how did Cinderella finish her dress so fast?
- Squirrels and birds.
- Mm.
- That's not very helpful.
- No.
- Hey, we got it!
- We got it.
Marriage license--done.
Wait a minute, hold on.
It needs to be signed by somebody at the City Clerk's Office.
I'll just forge it.
I forge government documents all the time.
- That's true.
- Boom.
No.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So we didn't find any rings.
Yeah, we're having a few roadblocks here.
Kind of feels like this thing is falling apart.
Don't panic.
I swear there's some rings in this old box of stuff my mom gave me.
Still here at April and Andy's house.
Want to come help me look?
Okay, Ann, dress duty.
April and Andy, license duty.
No time for verbs.
I know you're in a rush, Leslie.
I should point out that you said "duty" twice.
Okay.
Aw, shucks, business is a-boomin'.
Indiana celebrity look-alikes.
I mean, this is a brilliant idea, Donna.
All my favorites are here.
We got Orville Redenbacher, La Toya Jackson, Axl Rose, David Letterman.
Look, don't tell anyone, but I booked a special surprise.
There's a Li'l Sebastian look-alike on the way-- what?
What?
Oh, my G-- Oh!
Oh.
Did you just pee your pants?
Just a dab.
I better go clean up.
You nasty, Jerry.
Third time this week.
- Oh, what the hell!
- What's wrong?
"Your Minister Certification will be emailed to you in 24 hours".
Uhh!
But this is America.
I want it now!
Sorry, Tom, that's what happens.
I had all these great bits written for the wedding too.
I was gonna beatbox.
There's a dance breakdown.
I'm talking, like, six guaranteed applause breaks.
Uh, you know, I am actually ordained.
I could do the wedding.
That's the worst idea I've ever heard.
Yeah, you're right, okay.
Wait!
What if you do the ceremony, but you don't have any stupid ideas of your own, and you just say the stuff that I came up with?
Anything to help Leslie.
Perfect.
Now shut up and start memorizing.
We open with Will Smith's monologue from the modern cinematic classic Hitch.
Turtledove?
Falcon?
- Turtledove.
- Falcon?
- Turtledove.
- There's your butt.
Hey.
Did you find the rings?
No rings, just a tennis bracelet and a necklace that says "Wine Chick".
No rings, no license, no dress.
This idea felt so right, but maybe it's just too crazy.
Maybe it wasn't meant to be.
Hey, it's snowing.
- It's him.
- What?
Who?
I can't see.
I don't understand, this is impossible.
Wh-- Whoa.
Li'l Sebastian?
No, no, sorry.
Actually, this is Bucky.
He's a, uh, licensed Li'l Sebastian impersonator.
We're headed to the gala, so folks can pose for pictures with him.
if you're interested.
Quiet, you.
This is Li'l Sebastian, and this is a sign.
We're gonna do this.
We are gonna pull this wedding off.
- Come on, Bucky.
- Li'l Sebastian.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh my God, we're running out of time.
Ann, please, tell me that you have sewn a new dress from scratch.
Or several dresses, 'cause I would love some options.
I have an idea, and it might be insane, but I've been watching a lot Project Runway recently In the past eight years.
Okay, great, so I trust you, and make it work.
No time to do the Tim Gunn voice.
Wait, what am I talking about?
There's always time.
Designers, make it work.
Ann, you have less than an hour.
Miss Beavers, this is official police business.
I hope we didn't wake you up.
It's after 10:00.
I've been asleep for four hours.
What do you want?
We need you to sign this.
It's a marriage license.
Ethel?
Is it robbers?
No, go back to bed.
Aww, is that your husband?
I'm not married.
I was on a date tonight.
It went well, he's sleeping over.
Cool.
It'd really mean a lot if you sign it.
It's for Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt.
I think you know them?
They dragged me out in the freezing cold once, so they could tell each other "I love you".
It was annoying.
Oh, thank you so much!
You have got an amazing house and a really cool nightgown and seem to be super good at dating.
Yeah, so can we adopt you as our grandma?
- Fine.
- Cool!
We love you, Grandma!
I guess we could go to a pharmacy, but I really don't want to use like a cheap plastic ring.
I hate to say this, but Ann Perkins has terrible taste in rings.
What--what is this?
It's a toe ring with a brown gemstone?
Is this a ruby that's gone bad?
I am out of ideas.
Jewelry store.
No, that's closed, that's why we're doing this.
Perhaps I can be of service.
How?
How much do you think Ann would miss this sconce?
Oh, I don't know.
It's part of her house.
Well, okay.
"When I heard Ben was getting married, I was like, 'to Leslie or to Game of Thrones'"?
Ugh, horrible delivery.
"You ever heard Leslie talk about Ben's butt?
"I'm all like, 'damn, girl, you mad sweet on that back meat.
'" You're murdering my beautiful words!
Do you even want to kill at this wedding?
I just want Leslie and Ben to have a nice night.
- I'm sorry.
I-- - No, no.
It's my fault for believing in you.
Well, look, um, to be official, I just have to do the vows and the pronouncement.
So why don't you handle the speech, and then I'll just come in at the end?
Well, I'm not crazy about the part where you do something.
But, I do like the idea me doing something.
Let's give it a shot.
Hello, everyone.
Got some bad news.
The gala ends at 11:00.
The good news is, at 11:01, we'll be holding a special wedding ceremony.
Everyone is invited to stay.
All the drinks and the food will be on us.
Hey, everything going okay?
Everything would be peachy if it weren't for that dumbass with a megaphone.
No one wants a park here.
Parks are stu-pid.
Hey, butter-teeth, what's up?
I can fix those chompers for you.
Just come to Jamm Orthodontics.
Councilman Jamm, what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Parks are stu-pid.
Hey, enough.
You better give me back that megaphone.
That belongs to my aunt.
Why don't I call you a cab?
Mm.
No, this isn't over, Knope.
It is over.
I won fair and square.
And, in a half an hour, I am getting married over there to the most perfect man in the world.
And all my dreams are coming true.
Knope rules, Jamm sucks.
Knope rules, Jamm sucks.
Knope rules, Ja-- Councilman Howser.
Leslie.
Jeremy.
You better make sure my aunt gets her megaphone back.
Okay, did I-- did I do it right?
- How's it look?
- Terrible.
And perfect.
I promised myself I was not going to cry tonight.
And I have already broken that promise five times.
But I will not break it a sixth.
Go ahead and let it out, buddy.
It's okay.
- I have something for you.
- All right.
It is the letter from the statehouse Telling us that we have been assigned to Pawnee.
Dated may 1st, 2010.
No way.
We were supposed to be here eight weeks.
I'm so happy that those eight weeks turned into three years, and that you met Leslie, and that we both found a home.
Damn it, you're transferring your crying thing over to me.
It's okay, buddy, let it out.
I gathered up all the meaningful bills, pictures, documents, and memos from your career.
What do you think?
Is it okay?
It is the most beautiful object I have ever seen.
It is like the Ann Perkins of dresses.
Yay.
It is amazing.
All set.
Leslie, wow!
You look amazing.
Right?
- Oh, my God!
- What?
I'm not supposed to see you before the wedding.
- No, that's the groom - I ruined it!
Andy, that's the groom.
Well, I saw him too.
I'm just gonna cover my eyes, just to be safe.
Okay, so we're ready out there.
For your wedding or whatever.
Oh, my God, the license, the rings, the officiant, everything?
Yes, it all came together.
Let's go.
Boo, boo.
Boo, Leslie Knope, boo.
Here comes the boo all dressed in boo boo, Leslie Knope boo, boo-oo-oo-oo Boo!
Dude, what are you doing?
I'm being awesome.
Boo, boo, Leslie, boo.
My friend, I don't think you understand what a bad idea this is.
I don't think you understand that I would have got a cut of that new Paunch Burger if she hadn't screwed everything up.
So sorry, guys!
This wedding is canceled, 'cause the bride is a b-hole.
- Hey!
- Check this out.
Stink bomb!
Who knows what that does?
Oh!
Stink bomb?
Are you joking?
Oh, my God!
Where did you even get a stink bomb?
Amazon, baby, that's how.
You are looking at a prime customer, everybody.
Two days free shipping for this guy.
Let's get this party started with another one, gang!
No!
It's terrible!
Jerry, you do the wedding.
Who cares?
Come on, man, just go home.
And who's gonna make me?
It's your wedding day.
I'll handle this.
Here comes the bride.
- Time to go, sir.
- No.
Hey, get off me, what the hell, man?
- Don't you touch me.
- Oh.
I'll give you that one.
- But if you do it again-- - If I do what again?
What, kick your ass?
Is that what you like?
You want me to just pound-- Ooh!
Ow.
Yay, best wedding ever.
Ow.
You broke my tooth.
Well, good thing you're an orthodontist.
Yeah, it is a good thing.
You see my house?
- Five bathrooms.
- Great.
- I'm sorry, Leslie.
- For what?
I've never presented a bride on her wedding day, so I'm not 100% sure of the duties involved, but I don't think you're supposed to punch a man in the mouth during the service.
I think that's exactly what you're supposed to do, if that mouth is attached to a drunk jerk-face.
Well, please, don't worry about me.
- Just go and get married.
- No.
- Leslie.
- Ron.
Listen to me very carefully.
I lost my father when I was ten, I don't have any brothers, and Ken Burns never wrote me back.
So I am not getting married without you there to walk me down the aisle.
End of discussion.
Better get used to this, honey.
Gonna be a lot of late nights for me here.
Graveyard shift.
You coming to bring me coffee while I interrogate murderers.
You've had all night to get something out of him, Dwyer, - we gotta let him go.
- Come on, Captain.
I'm this close to getting a confession.
You're never gonna break him, Dwyer.
He's a psychopath.
He chopped off both of his arms, so he wouldn't leave any fingerprints.
Oh, he did?
Well, how did he murder the person?
- I don't know.
- Hey, Chief Fugleberg.
It's me, Andy Dwyer, pre-reporting for duty.
Listen, about my new partner.
Is it a dog?
Oh, has Chris Traeger not told you?
Told me what?
Hey, Ron, we posted bail.
- You're free to go.
- Wait a minute, what?
He punched me in the teeth.
This is an outrage.
I think we have a pretty clear picture of what went down.
Sleep it off in the cell, Councilman.
Leslie, I'm so sorry.
I think we missed it.
The gala's over, they're taking it all down.
Yeah, it's okay.
I mean, I guess it just wasn't meant to be, after all.
We'll get married in May like we planned.
You know what?
I have some champagne, back at the office.
Let's go back there, have a drink, toast to Pawnee Commons.
Fun.
That's a good idea.
It'll be good, 'cause I actually have some work I need to get started on.
I got five bathrooms.
I love the first floor of City Hall at night.
When all the fluorescents are half-off.
Just makes the informational fliers look so beautiful.
I've never willingly been here later than 5:04 p.m. Before we go inside, I'd like to say something.
You are a wonderful person.
Your friendship means a lot to me.
And you look very beautiful.
Okay, weirdo.
Let's go.
Hoo, boy.
All set?
Mmhmm Jerry, everything I wrote is wrong.
There's, like, 20 minutes of Hitch quotes before I even say Leslie's name.
What do I do?
You know what, Tom?
Just speak from the heart, okay?
You'll do great.
We are gathered here tonight to join Leslie Knope and Benjamin Wyatt in marriage.
It's been a long and winding road for these two lovebirds.
And they're so impatient to begin their lives together they've moved their wedding date up three months.
So I say, let's keep it short and sweet.
Yes, just do it already.
I assume, and hope, you prepared your own vows?
Ben, you want to say some stuff about Leslie?
In my time working for the state government, my job sent me to 46 cities in 11 years.
I lived in villages with eight people, rural farming communities, college towns.
I was sent to every corner of Indiana.
And then I came here.
And I realized that, this whole time, I was just wandering around, everywhere, just looking for you.
Leslie, do you want to say some stuff about Ben now?
Okay, well, the first draft of my vows, which I wrote the day after we got engaged, clocked in at around 70 pages.
But I don't have them with me today.
Although maybe there's a copy of them in my office.
No.
That's fine, that's fine.
- I think we can just keep going.
- Okay.
Here's what I'll say, then.
The things that you have done for me, to help me, support me, surprise me, to make me happy, go above and beyond what any person deserves.
You're all I need.
I love you and I like you.
I love you and I like you.
And now, with the power vested in me by the state of Indiana, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the-- well, oops, okay.
- Yay!
- Whoo!
Lagavulin all around?
Don't bother answering.
I am already pouring.
- You don't have to drink yours.
- Thank you.
Just this once, I thought I nailed something.
Well, I'm still proud of you.
You worked hard and you got really close.
Close only counts in horse grenades.
- What?
- It's a saying.
Because if you're playing horseshoes, and then you throw a grenade at a horse, it doesn't have to be that close, and you can still blow the horse's legs off.
It's from the movie Seabiscuit.
How's it going in here?
Good.
I was just telling Andy that I'm proud of him.
Oh.
And I was just explaining to April that I'm a failure, and she should leave me for Orin.
Andy, this is a very important moment for you.
How we deal with tragedy defines who we are.
I used to be terrible at it.
Beyond terrible.
You are not going to let this deflate you.
You are going to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and we will figure out what the next step is.
Chris can be very Paternal.
I look around this room.
If it weren't for Leslie Knope, none of us would be here.
So, Leslie, this song, which is for Li'l Sebastian, is for you.
Up in horsey heaven, here's the thing you trade your legs for angel's wings and once we've all said good-bye you take a running leap, and you learn to fly Bye-bye, Li'l Sebastian miss you in the saddest fashion There were a lot of signs that Ben and I should get married tonight.
But, truth be told, we just really wanted to get married.
When you're in love, everything seems like a sign.
I love my husband.
I love my job.
And I love my friends.
Even though they really can't handle their booze.
Hey, we should just go, right?
Careful.
Spread your wings and fly spread your wings and fly It's not rocket science.
I removed the sconce Fired up my grandfather's torch, heated up the pieces in a cast-iron bucket.
Liquefied the metal.
Pour it into a mold.
Obviously keep it over a low flame to achieve a nice temper.
Cooled it in antifreeze.
And just forged and shaped the rings.
Any moron with a crucible, an acetylene torch, and a cast-iron waffle maker could have done the same.
Whole thing only took me about 20 minutes.
People who buy things are suckers.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Well, the honeymoon was amazing.
We saw the bus stop where a young Barack Obama used to sit and wait for the bus.
-Theoretically.
- It's possible.
Then we went and visited Honolulu City Hall.
- Shut up.
- You know.
- Oh, my God, what was it like?
- It was amazing.
Well, it looked amazing, but it was closed.
Oh, my God, bummer.
Okay, I have presents!
Um Chris, we got you an Acai tree because the Acai berry is a superfood.
And a super gift.
Donna, we got you some coffee, because you said, and I quote, "I like my coffee like I like my men.
Dark, rich, and full-bodied".
Yes, indeed.
Ann, we got you some very rare Hawaiian fertility tea, guaranteed to help you have a baby.
That's so nice.
Where'd you find that?
Well, the busboy at our restaurant told us about a guy who we met in a parking lot, and then he had a backpack full of this stuff, and I'm just realizing now that it's not tea.
And I'm gonna throw it away.
Ron, this is the Hawaiian god of anger.
It reminded us of you when you're at work.
A handsome gentleman.
- We did not forget Jerry.
- Right, right.
We got Jerry some earbuds, and a bag of peanuts, and the Skymall catalog.
Same thing you got me from your trip to Washington!
Tom, we got you an autographed portrait of your personal hero.
No way!
Scott Caan from Hawaii five-0!
April, as requested, we threw that box you gave us into that volcano.
Thank you.
Andy, as you requested, got you a three-pack of white T-shirts from Target.
Thank you.
All mine are dirty.
Thank you, Hawaii.
Thank you so much.
It's great to be here at the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch.
There's so many wonderful, talented journalists here.
Also here are some reporters from the Pawnee Sun.
Oh, hey, hey.
I love the Pawnee Sun.
Some people say that it's a useless tabloid.
But I don't think it's useless.
I think it's great for housebreaking puppies.
I am prepping for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch.
It's an annual affair where the media and the government roast each other.
My number one target-- the Pawnee Sun.
they rake me over the coals.
Today, I take those burning coals, I shove them back down their throats, and I watch their melting flesh drip off their worthless faces!
It's all in good fun.
Okay, I need more jokes, people.
Ben is having his first day at work, so he cannot help me.
So I need you guys to pick up the slack.
- I have a joke for you.
- Okay.
The government in this town is excellent and uses your tax dollars efficiently.
- That's not really a joke, Ron.
- I disagree.
I find it hilarious.
- Ann Perkins!
- Hey, Chris!
Got to run to a meeting.
With Ron.
Great idea!
I'll run to my next meeting.
Sorry, the door was open.
I wish this office had only walls.
Chris broke up with his girlfriend a week ago, and I have decided to ask him to be the father of my baby.
Except I cannot work up the nerve to do it.
Turns out they don't make greeting cards for asking your ex-boyfriend if he will artificially inseminate you.
Actually, Ron, I-I could use your advice on how to be blunt and honest.
I want my friend to do something for me, and I don't know how to ask him.
What do you want him to do?
Plant ficuses.
In my front yard.
Grossest metaphor ever.
I've seen your house.
You'd have more success if he planted ficuses in your backyard.
No, I don't think so.
Anyway, what if he thinks I'm asking too much of him, and I ask him to plant the ficuses, and he doesn't want to, and he gets weird about it, and it ruins our friendship?
Then plant the damn ficuses yourself.
I wish that were possible.
We are so excited to have you working with us here at the all-new Sweetums Foundation.
This is your office.
This is incredible.
And look at that art.
Ah, yes.
My late husband.
He was so decrepit.
I really like helping people.
Running the new Sweetums Foundation charity allows me to do that and work in an office with more mahogany wood than currently remains in the Amazon rain forest.
So, win-win.
Except for the rain forest.
I need you to select your first charity by tomorrow.
Sweetums' public image is currently at an all-time low.
Yeah, there's even a rumor going around that the chocolate is made of rat parts.
Well You know what they say about rumors.
- Yeah.
- They're mostly true.
Including the rat thing?
Yeah.
What are you gonna do?
It's where all the flavor comes from.
Oh, would you look at that.
There is a smudge on my tail.
Oh!
All better.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch, where politicians and the media make fun of each other.
But, if you ask me, we should be making fun of the food.
"I am not the cook".
Oh, well, well, well.
If it isn't Kim Terlando from the Pawnee Sun.
Do you happen to have a can opener?
'Cause I'm about to open this on you.
Did you make that can of "whoop ass" for this exact moment?
Yeah, I came prepared.
I'd expect nothing less.
Good luck with your speech.
Uh, my speech doesn't need your luck.
It needs a Surgeon General's warning because it's so harmful to your health.
Oh, look, it has one.
That's how ready I am.
I'm glad you're so confident.
Nice to see you.
It was nice to see you too.
Chris, can I talk to you for a second?
Absolutely.
I cannot wait.
One second.
Excuse me, sir.
I think I accidentally got the meat option.
Yeah, and I got the veggie option.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, my ex-girlfriend.
It seems like you and I have a classic mix 'em up.
Yeah, fancy meeting you here.
This isn't awkward for you, is it?
Chris, it's okay.
You wanna switch?
I'm starving.
Definitely.
Whoa!
Check out the new digs.
This place is insane.
Thanks for coming, guys.
I'm super swamped, and I need your help.
Pass.
You came down here to pass on helping me?
Yeah, I wanted to see what your face looked like when I said no.
It was totally worth it.
Andy, are you okay?
Oh, I'm fine.
It's just that life is pointless and nothing matters and I'm always tired.
Also, I can't sleep, I'm overeating, none of my old hobbies interest me.
Ever since Andy failed the police academy exam, his self-esteem has hit rock bottom.
He's always sad and sweaty.
He's usually happy and sweaty.
I have to pick our first charity by tomorrow, and there's a million applications.
Can you guys help me sort 'em out?
You know what?
This sounds like fun.
Babe, come on.
Let's help him.
It'll be fun.
Well, it sounds like you guys got it covered.
I'm gonna head out.
Actually have my own charity to attend to.
Tommy's tummy foundation.
Well, they bring me fancy lunches here.
If you stay, you can have some.
What?
Crab, caviar?
On behalf of Tommy's tummy foundation, I'm happy to accept this generous donation.
Please welcome Kim Terlando.
Thank you, Martin.
It's nice to be here among all of these excellent journalists.
And also the people that work with me over at the Pawnee Sun.
Damn it.
That was my opener.
Now I love working at the Sun, okay?
And I know you all think it's just a useless tabloid, but it's not.
It is great.
For housebreaking puppies.
Those are my jokes.
She's stealing my jokes.
Some people say that the Sun has a problem with the truth.
There's no problem, we just ignore it.
Jerry, stop laughing.
Those are stolen jokes!
Totally dead.
What am I gonna do?
Oh!
I just opened up a can of "whoop ass" on myself!
I remember the very first Correspondents' Lunch.
I rode here in a horse and buggy.
No, no, no, that wasn't a joke.
I actually did.
That also was not a joke.
Ron, Kim told all my jokes, all of them.
She must have gotten a copy of my speech.
Did anybody lose their copy?
- Nope.
- Right here.
Mine is right here.
Oh, jeez.
Go stand in the corner and think about what you've done.
And no dessert!
I need new material, and it needs to be great, and it needs to knock people on their butts, and it needs to transcend the genre of roast comedy.
- Perkins, go.
- Oh, wow.
Um, okay, so Councilman Milton is old, right?
And he's wearing a green tie.
So, like, maybe there's something there, where, like, he went to school with his high-school buddies that were dinosaurs.
And his tie is green.
They're green.
Oh, Ann, you're too beautiful to be funny.
It's not your fault.
You've never had to compensate for anything.
The rest of you ugly nerds need to give me some jokes stat.
Ben?
Ben?
Yeah, Andy.
I think I might have found something that's actually pretty cool.
Okay, well, just put it aside, and I'll read it later.
No.
Andy found it, and he's gonna tell you about it right now.
Go, babe.
Uh, it's the Redwood Music Program.
It's an after-school music class for at-risk kids.
- It'll keep them off the street.
- Whoa.
And the streets, as you know, are dangerous.
Example--I fell in a sewer grate once.
I was there all day.
In conclusion, we cannot let our children live in the sewer any longer.
Redwood Music Program-- go, your honor, amen.
That's a great idea.
Anyone else come across anything good?
Tom?
Um, yeah.
I got a good one.
It's called the Clean Sheet Foundation.
That's my pick.
They provide legal assistance to the KKK.
This is your pick?
Yeah.
Can you pass the bonbons?
Perd Hapley is here today.
Or, as Perd would say, "My name is Perd Hapley, and the person I see here today is me".
Everyone seems to be laughing now.
Do you see what is happening with Chris and Shauna?
They are flirting like crazy.
It's disgusting.
They're in public.
That's called a conversation.
Ron, there are no ficuses, okay?
I wanted to ask Chris to be the father of my baby.
Good God.
And the metaphor you chose was planting ficuses in your front yard?
I was gonna wait till he was single to ask him, but now he's flirting with Shauna again.
What do I do?
- It's been nice talking to you.
- What?
Maybe I should just do impressions.
"I'm-a Borat".
There's one.
But I need to do someone that no one has heard before.
Like, I don't know, Neve Campbell?
What does Neve Campbell sound like?
I don't know.
Someone, tell me what Neve Campbell sounds like.
Just keep it short and get the hell out of there.
Thank you.
Our next guest has asked me to read this.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, I forgot I did this.
Joan, no-- "Strap on your adult diapers, everyone.
"Because you're about to wet yourself from laughter.
Give it up for Leslie Knope".
"Whassup," Pawnee?
Um Borat.
Well, that's my time.
They're giving me the light.
So, uh, I did great.
Thank you, Leslie Knope.
You know what they say.
Drama is hard, and sometimes comedy is not in our wheelhouse.
Tom, do you have to run that right now?
Oh, no, Ben!
These smoothies will just blend themselves!
Okay.
Think I have our winner.
It's called Rural Ambu-care.
They want to buy an ambulance for people who live far away from the hospital.
Ambulances are dumb.
When has an ambulance ever helped anyone?
What about Andy's music thing?
Well, this is a great service that will help a lot of needy people.
Sorry, Andy.
Why?
No, it's totally fine.
I'm happy for them.
That's awesome.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna head out to, uh, the car.
It's a little hot in here, a little sweaty.
Well, I'm terribly disappointed.
But I'm sure the doctors or giraffes or whatever you decided to help will be thrilled with the whatever you decided to whatever.
I'm outtie.
Great job, team.
What?
Ever since Andy failed the police exam, he's been really depressed.
Picking out a dumb charity is the most excited he's been in weeks.
You're so selfish.
Selfish?
I'm running a charity.
Oh, it's all about what you're doing, isn't it?
Classic Ben!
Sorry, forgot the oysters.
Great work today.
Christopher.
"Chris-toe-fur".
It's like you have furry toes.
Hilarious.
I have a question for you.
It's something very important.
Which is What is your Spirit animal?
Jaguar.
Why do you ask?
Doin' a survey.
Well, survey completed.
So take 'er easy.
Uh, you didn't ask me.
But if you had, the answer I would have given is Doggie.
Chris, Ann wants to ask you something right now.
Go, Ann.
- In front of Perd?
- Yes.
No more delays.
Go.
I want to have a baby.
Will you be the sperm donor?
The story of this situation is it's extremely personal.
Think it over.
Bye.
Leslie, permission to leave the corner.
Denied.
But, look, I did not lose your speech after all.
I forgot.
I put it in my shoe for safekeeping.
It's a little moist, but it is still here.
Well, then how did Kim get the speech?
Wait a minute.
The Pawnee Sun has been one step ahead of me for months.
They knew that Kernston's withdrew its sponsorship of the Commons before I even announced it.
They asked me about the sewage eruption in Ramsett Park right after Ron emailed me about it.
And Kim asked me if I liked the first season Army Wives just moments after Netflix did.
The Pawnee Sun hacked my email.
I've been hacked!
Okay, smashing your phone won't stop hacking.
That's also my phone.
Jerry, quiet!
This is serious.
Well, the police said they're gonna launch an investigation to see whether or not I was hacked.
But it's very complicated, and it could take up to a month.
There is nothing more disgusting than an invasion of privacy.
And I should know.
I've had many women steal my undershirts.
I have a press conference about the Pawnee Commons in two hours.
So I need to go through every email that I've ever sent, ever.
I need to know what they might use against me.
You can't hack into a typewriter.
That's all I have to say.
Can it, Unabomber.
This is an emergency.
- Hey, Ben.
- Hi.
You wanted to talk to me?
Or probably not.
I mean, I don't even want to talk to me.
- No, I wanted to talk to you.
- Oh.
I just wanted to thank you so much for your help, Andy.
Sorry we didn't wind up choosing the after-school music program.
It's just-- I totally get it.
The music program would be effective, but the ambulance is gonna help people right now who are in trouble and will probably look good in the media.
Yeah, that's exactly right.
Your morning tea, Mr. Wyatt.
Imagine all the money you could save if you didn't have to pay for this expensive stuff.
Am I right?
You could help, like, a zillion more charities.
Yeah, that's also exactly right.
I feel like I should have thought of that.
Well, let me tell you something else that's interesting, Ben.
- What?
- I farted five minutes ago.
Didn't even smell it till just now.
That's how tight my pants are.
Anyhow Later days, dudes.
Okay, nothing too bad so far.
There's a "Top Ten Ben's butt 2012 slide show".
You emailed it to Ben and Ann And The Huffington Post?
Yeah, I'm not embarrassed by that.
Who is Todo Toadfoot?
You wrote him an email about riding your dragons to Pelennor Fields and signed it "Dimple Broadbelt of Buckland".
Yes, that's Ben and my fantasy Lord Of The Rings pen pal letters.
I am a little embarrassed by that.
Here's one to me, and it just says "Thanks".
You're welcome.
Oh, great, I got a new email about the parking lot at the Pawnee Commons.
I keep getting emails all the time!
I have to do well at this press conference!
Donna!
Listen, freaky.
Every single one of my boyfriends has tried to hack into my email.
I've got an idea Everybody out.
Ann Perkins, I see you behind that attractive purse.
You haven't returned any of my calls.
Yeah, that's because, uh, I'm mortified.
I'm so sorry that I was so weird and blunt.
I am touched and honored that you would even consider me to be the father of your child.
And I'm glad that you came right out and said it.
I mean, if we're really considering this, then we have to start at a place of complete honesty.
You're right.
And I'll start now.
You are a great specimen.
That's a terrible choice of words.
If my baby turned out to be anything like you I'd be lucky.
Can I have just a little bit of time to think about it?
Of course, yes.
Take as much time as you want.
Or just maybe, like, a couple days.
'Cause I'm getting antsy.
And I'm ovulating on Thursday.
So, chop-chop.
But take your time.
Wear loose pants!
I gotta tell you, Ron.
You were absolutely and totally right.
I know.
Stop talking and get out.
Yep.
The redneck ambulance is a great choice.
We can release a publicity shot of a bucktoothed hayseed taking medicine for the first time in his life.
We can figure out the photo later.
Oh, I forgot!
It's Fondue Friday.
Yay!
Yeah, also, as President of the foundation, I'm making a few changes.
I'm giving up this office.
And no more visits from a masseuse or fancy lunches.
It's way out of hand.
Sweetie, all the money we spend on the foundation is tax deductible.
I know, and it's a huge waste of money.
I mean, there's plenty of cheap office space around.
And I have an idea for how to use some of the money we'll save.
Get yourself a matching nude portrait?
- I can call the painter.
- Please don't.
First, I'd like you all to check under your chairs.
I think you might be surprised and excited by what you find.
- Is it chocolate?
- Even better.
It's dirt.
The EPA has recently reviewed our soil samples, and they determined that we achieved, and I quote, "Minimal acceptable standards".
So not too shabby.
Uh, Councilwoman Knope, you've claimed construction will take 18 months, but a source tells me it will be much longer.
I would-- I would deny that report.
I've also learned that the EPA found midi-chlorians in the soil.
How serious is that, exactly?
It's very serious, Kim.
It's almost as serious as email hacking, which is what you have been doing to me for weeks.
I really thought you guys would gasp there.
That is a baseless accusation.
Midi-chlorians are a fictional substance found in the blood of Jedi knights from the movie Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.
Which, side-note, was a terrible movie.
It almost destroyed the franchise, according to my husband.
But that is neither here nor there.
The point is I sent Councilwoman Knope the fake email about the EPA finding midi-chlorians, an hour ago As a trap.
Into which you have fallen.
Well I have never seen Star Wars, because I was too busy hooking up with guys.
Unlike you losers.
Uh, you wanna compare numbers, Terlando?
Get to steppin'.
I would just like to point out that Kim Terlando stole all of my jokes for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch, and they were great jokes.
So I spent the whole night writing new ones.
Lucky for you, let's get started.
I'm very excited to be here.
You know who else is excited to be here?
- Neve Campbell.
- Oh, boy.
What a great party of five.
All right, thank you, guys.
The point is, I could use someone to help me at the foundation as a part-time assistant but also an idea man.
Might I suggest Tom?
He loves ideas.
Also a man.
What-- No, Andy, I've already chosen the person.
And it is not Tom Then who is it?
Well, he is, uh, sitting right here in this courtyard.
That guy?
Do you even know him?
Oh, my God, Andy, it's you.
I think you may have a knack for charitable giving.
Will you come work for me?
Uh-oh.
What's happening?
Oh.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Rent-A-Swag shareholders: As you can see, your store is hoppin'.
These kids are renting my old clothes like they're going out of style.
Which they never will.
Yeah, it's a lot of foot traffic, Tommy.
I like it.
Oh, "day-yay-yam," it is kind of a sausage party in here.
For the record, would hit it, would hit, would hit.
Hard pass.
Tom, who is this person?
This is Mona-Lisa Saperstein, my new sales associate.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein?
- Does that mean-- - Oh, yeah she's my sister.
My twin sister, from the same mister.
Thank you so much for hiring Mona-Lisa.
It means so much to me.
Even though, honestly, she's The wo-o-orst.
She is the worst person in the world.
Huge skank.
Terrible.
But thank you.
It means a lot.
Of course.
Got to keep it in the family.
Yeah, but does it have to be this family?
Actually, that reminds me, Ba-ba-ba-boss man I need to leave early today because my shrink got me and him tickets to a Pitbull concert.
And I already committed to that.
And so if you say that I can't go, it's like you're taking something away from me.
Um, store's really busy.
- I kinda need you to stay.
- Mmhmm.
I totally hear you.
Um, I also don't like what you're saying.
So if you say no, I will start a fire in the bathroom.
Okay, I guess you can go.
Yeah, I know I can.
What did I tell you, huh?
The wo-o-o-orst.
She's the worst in the world.
Jean-Ralphio.
How are you?
Hello.
Welcome to Pawnee Videodome.
Today we'll be screening Stanley Kubrick's 1957 classic Paths Of Glory.
It's about three men who refuse to go on a suicide mission and are executed for cowardice.
Or we could, you know, maybe screen a different movie.
One that's a little bit more upbeat.
Like Finding Nemo or I could do, uh,Shoah.
Okay,Paths Of Glory it is.
This is the Pawnee Videodome.
And we are here because I started a program to help local business.
This is a Pawnee institution.
This is the place where Perd Hapley shot his movie review show Lights, Camera, Perd.
It's a heartwarming story, but it's just not believable.
Which is why I give E. T. 1 1/2 stars.
Andy, it's over.
Get up, Andy.
What are you doing?
What's everybody-- where are we?
The reason I love that film is that it's really depressing.
Speaking of which, sadly, next month, Pawnee Videodome will be closing its doors.
- Forever.
- No!
For those of you that have attended our screenings, I want to thank you for your patronage, though I wish you would have rented more movies.
Guys, we have to help out Dennis and his business.
Everybody rent something, so we can help Dennis.
Sir, will you rent something?
Why would I do that?
All movies are online for free.
I'm watching Iron Man 2 on my phone right now.
Okay, you're not helping.
I, for one, am going to rent Finding Nemo.
Ooh, we don't carry cartoons.
But if you want a film about the ocean, we have a documentary about the brutality of Japan's whaling industry.
It's called Tears Of My Blowhole.
And it's--it's nauseating.
I'll just buy some red vines.
Oh, we only have Japanese slime candy and, um, Bulgarian wheat balls.
Leslie, seriously, where are we?
All these kids have fathers and mothers who have birthed them and are guiding them through life.
Yep, that's how it works.
How are you feeling?
Did you make your dad-cision yet?
I am 100% certain that I am 0% sure of what I'm going to do.
Ann Perkins asked me if I would like to donate sperm, so she can have a baby.
It's a battle between my primal desire to bring a child into this world and my paralyzing fear of negatively affecting any living thing.
There's $60 missing from the register.
I think Mona-Lisa's stealing from me.
Yeah, it is absolutely Mona-Lisa.
She's a total klepto.
And nympho and pyro-- all those things.
Okay, as your CFO, I recommend getting rid of her immediately.
I'm throwing a huge cocktail party tomorrow for all my best clients.
I don't have time to find someone new.
This sucks.
You know, when I was in high school, we had to spend a week carrying around a sack of flour, pretending it was a kid.
Why don't you make Tom your sack of flour, see how it feels to parent him a little?
Ben, that is literally the greatest idea in human history.
I heard "sack of flour" and "high school".
Are you dingdongs making fake drugs for sophomores?
Because if true, this guy wants in.
Yeah, just have Mr. Traeger call me when he gets back in.
Actually, you know what?
Don't tell him that I called.
Just when he gets there, can you text me and tell me he's back?
You know what?
Let's just pretend this didn't happen, okay?
This is Jerry Gergich calling.
Bye.
I have to tell you a secret.
But if you tell anyone, I will kill you slowly with a giant syringe.
Good morning, April.
What's your secret?
I'm thinking about applying to veterinary school in Bloomington.
Oh, my God, April, that's great!
Whoa!
Where'd you get that?
The Internet.
So I really need a letter of recommendation.
And since you work in a hospital, - as a janitor - Nurse.
I was wondering if maybe you would write one for me?
Really?
Generally, between us, April always has the upper hand.
And that hand is usually giving me the finger or pouring honey in my purse.
But now I have the upper hand.
And I'm going to use it to crush her Into being nice to me.
I would be happy to write you that letter.
I actually know the guy who runs the veterinary program over there.
Because you hooked up with him?
I don't hook up with everyone I know.
Although, yes, we did hook up.
But before I write you that letter, you have to spend the next week with me and do everything I say.
So I have to be your slave or something?
No, you have to be my friend.
No, that is so much worse.
Don't do that.
I think I have a plan of how to save your store.
If we get the Pawnee Historical Society to declare your store as a historical landmark, then you might get enough of a tax break to keep your business afloat.
That sounds like the government meddling in private enterprise.
Well, Ron, we all know how much you love the free market.
But the Pawnee Videodome is the only place in town where people gather to do something intellectual.
That and the slam poetry nights at Beanie's Coffee.
But I do not count those because those poems do not rhyme.
Anything can be a slam poem if you say it like this.
It's pointless.
This man is a failure.
He is not up to snuff.
His business is failing, and you're bailing it out.
This is a bailout, and I don't like it.
And there are some pretty intellectual conversations down at Barrett's Hardware.
You may get a little heat for this, okay?
So use your money wisely.
Get popular films that people wanna see.
Like, uh, get the Tarkovsky movies No.
Like Pixar.
Reese Witherspoon.
I know this is gonna hurt, but maybe some Michael Bay.
What?
No, no.
No.
Tom, I have something I need to talk to you about.
- Do we need to sit like this?
- Yes.
Mona-Lisa's taking advantage of you.
And I'm sure that it's not easy when it's the sister of a dear friend.
Oh, no, it's not that.
She scares the crap out of me.
I once saw her punch a police horse in the face.
Speak directly to her and tell her, "I will not be disrespected".
You're Tom Haverford.
You're a smart, successful young man with an adorable, little belly.
Stand up for yourself.
Yeah, I'll talk to her before the party.
And if she murders me, tell Jean-Ralphio to clear my browser history.
Thanks for the advice, man.
You're welcome.
Son.
What's that?
- Nothing.
- All right.
Pawnee Videodome is where I rented my first Bruce Lee movie.
And my second Bruce Lee movie.
And when I was in seventh grade, I went out back in the alley behind the store, and there was a giant hornet's nest.
And I threw a rock at it, and it exploded.
- And hornets came out.
- Andy- The point is, obviously, you do not throw rocks at a hornet's nest.
And the point is also that the Pawnee Videodome is a place with tremendous community value, where people gather to expand their horizons.
Any other comments here before we vo-- Ron?
What are you doing at a city council meeting?
Are you lost?
Are you hurt?
No, I am here to express an opinion.
This action by Councilwoman Knope is nothing more than a thinly veiled government bailout.
And I, for one, refuse to let her turn this town into a socialist hellscape.
Allow me to elaborate.
The government should not prop up a failed business.
That would be like giving food to a mortally wounded animal instead of slitting its throat and properly utilizing its meat and pelt.
Please stop talking about wounded meat.
Pawnee needs a place where the community can gather to discuss and appreciate art.
A place where you can rent such films as Cinema Paradiso or Rashomon.
You rented Rashomon?
What was your favorite part of that?
I haven't rented it, actually, yet.
But I like the idea that there is a place where I could rent Rashomon.
Uh, you can just watch it online, for free, whenever you want.
Bailiff!
Thank you, Mr. Swanson, for your absurd opinion, which is shared by no one.
Now, are there any more public comments before we vote?
Mm.
How much to rent this jacket?
Oh.
Curly Sue, that jacket is so ugly.
You should just take it.
It's 15 for the day, Thank you.
We appreciate your business.
Mona-Lisa!
Did you order the champagne for the client party tonight?
Did I order the what for the what-what what, what?
What are you even talking about right now?
Okay, we need to discuss your work habits.
Okay, sure, but after I take a quick nap because ecstasy takes forever to leave my system No.
We're doing this now.
You need to start putting in more of an effort and start respecting my authority around here!
Or else what?
Or else I'll fire you.
What did you just say?
I said, if you don't shape up, I'll fire you.
Do you understand?
You are so freaking sexy right now, I could crap my pants.
Ugh.
What are you doing?
I guess it would have to be Channing Tatum's body, Ryan Gosling's face, and Michael Fassbender's sense of humor.
What about you?
Build your perfect guy.
Um Yao Ming's torso, Napoleon's brain, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame's hunchback.
Do you like my nails?
Even though she hides it underneath layers of sarcasm, resentment, and grumpiness, I know, deep down somewhere, April likes me.
I'm kind of just fracking for friendship.
Gene Strackwell, owner of Strackwell Hardware.
Is there a form I need to fill out for the bailout?
We're not bailing anyone out.
Pawnee Videodome is receiving historical landmark status.
We've been around way longer than that stupid art house movie bullcrap.
And people need places to buy tools.
Uh, you can just buy tools online.
Bailiff, why is he back in here?
How did you get back in here?
I'll see myself out.
Don't worry about it.
I heard you were giving out free money.
I need $3,000.
Minimum.
Mr. Fantringham, the city of Pawnee is not gonna give you a personal loan.
What would you do if one of your citizens was about to come into some serious physical harm Unless he got $3,000?
I'd call the police.
You cannot call the police.
Wilson Gromling of the "Liberty or Die" party.
These government handouts are deplorable.
You're just handing out blank checks.
I was on food stamps.
I was on Welfare.
And nobody ever helped me.
This is not a blank check.
I have given specific instructions to the Pawnee Videodome about how they are going to spend their money.
In a few days, Dennis will reopen.
The store will serve a wider range of Pawnee's citizens, and a Pawnee cultural institution will be saved.
- Are there any other comments?
- Yes.
The Pawnee chapter of the "Liberty or Die" party has hit some hard times.
We were wondering if maybe the town could loan us some money.
Mmhmm.
Tom, how did it go with Mona-Lisa?
I told her she needed to change her attitude, or I was gonna have to fire her.
Well, that is very responsible and mature.
She took it well?
Um yeah.
For some reason, she got super turned on.
We started making out.
Hard.
Next thing you know, we're back at my place, having sex.
We're together now.
Hey, bitch, I need to borrow some money to do something that is none of your damn beeswax, namely, I need to wax my bee.
Here you go.
I'd still hit it.
I'm coolin' on you.
See?
Perfect!
Okay, you have to choose one.
I can't think.
These braids you did are making my brain hurt.
Fine.
Miranda.
No, I think you're a Charlotte.
You're like a scary Charlotte.
Hey.
Hey, you.
What's-- what's up?
Nothin'.
This is weird.
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.
- Why is it weird?
- It's not weird.
Do you want to talk in private?
No, anything you can say to Ann, you can say to me because we're best friends this week.
Ccan we talk later?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Why don't you talk now?
- No, talk to you later.
- Chris, we can talk now.
- What's going on, best friend?
- Nothing, never mind.
- Tell me.
- Nothing's happening.
Back to forced friendship.
Hey, let's go put on our pj's and make White Russians.
So fun.
Councilwoman.
I just came down to see the effects of your government intervention, and I've got to hand it to you-- You really turned this place around.
Really?
Oh, my God, this is amazing, Dennis.
- Hey.
- You did it!
We did it!
I did it.
- This is me.
- Yes, it was.
I took your advice.
Got rid of all those dusty, old foreign films and used the money for the part of our business that's always done pretty well for us.
Give the people what they want, right?
This isn't what people want.
It's definitely what that guy wants.
I like this store now.
Do you realize what you have done?
The Pawnee government now effectively owns a porn shop.
You have made us porn peddlers!
Hello everyone, I'm Brandi Maxxxx.
Let's give a big round of applause to Councilwoman Knope for keeping this store in business!
No.
Everyone stop applauding.
For the record, I was just trying to help a place that had tremendous cultural value.
Leslie, you've always been a huge supporter of my work.
No, no, I haven't.
So I'm thrilled to tell you that I'm playing Leslie Knope in the porn version of the story of this government bailout!
Please don't do that.
- Oh, we already filmed it.
- Oh!
The porn industry in town was really faltering.
But now we're back.
You're our hero!
Oh!
Okay.
Are you ready?
For you to tell me what's going on with Chris?
Yes.
No.
To sing.
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time go.
No, tell me about Chris.
If you fall, I will catch you I'll be waitin' Tell me about Chris, or I'm leaving, and I don't care about the letter.
I wanna have a baby, and I asked Chris to donate his sperm.
And he's taking a really long time to make up his mind, and it's really freaking me out.
And I can't stop thinking about it, and I'm obsessing about it, and I want to think about anything else but that, but it's making me crazy.
Secrets stolen from deep inside.
- You know this song already?
- Of course I do.
Everyone knows this song.
It's amazing.
The drum beats out of time if you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time if you fall, I will catch you oh, I'll be waiting time after time time after time time after time.
This never happened.
I made everything worse.
If Tom were a bag of flour, that flour would never grow up to be a happy, well-adjusted loaf of bread.
Much less a bran muffin, which is the highest honor that flour can achieve.
Okay, so you're really gonna say no to Ann?
I care about Ann very deeply, but I just don't know if I'm cut out to be a dad.
You know, Chris, every parent makes mistakes.
I mean, lord knows I've made plenty.
But it's the small victories that keep you going.
When you see your little one take her first step or--or graduate college, oh, my God, it just makes it all worth it.
And another thing is if-- If, like-- If I-- You know, and then your kid's-- because you're like--vrrrr-- I don't know.
And everyone's like, "Oh".
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.
I--no one ever lets me talk this long.
I just got lost.
It was a beautiful point.
And very well said, right up until that moment that you started babbling incoherently.
And I'll have the number eight.
That's a party platter.
It serves 12 people.
I know what I'm about, son.
Go ahead, Ron.
Let me have it.
Oh, wait, I'll do it for you.
I told you so, Leslie.
This is what happens when the government interferes with business.
Government is bad, business is good.
Free market.
Capitalism is the only way, Leslie.
It moves our country forward.
It's what makes America great.
And England okay and France terrible.
I like capitalism.
I love competition.
I'm more competitive than you.
- I don't think so.
- I think so.
- Settle down.
- No, settle up.
'Cause the bill's been paid, and I've paid it, and I've won.
Look, the point is there has to be a way for the government to help places that add community value but don't necessarily rake in the money.
There is not.
The free market is a jungle.
It's beautiful and brutal and should be left alone.
When a business fails, it dies, and a new, better one takes its place.
Just let business be business and government be government.
Here you go.
And one number eight.
All right, party time.
I would suggest sticking around and watching him eat it 'cause it only takes four minutes, and it's pretty amazing.
These will not be necessary.
Here is your letter of recommendation, so you're off the hook.
No need to pretend to be my friend anymore.
Thank God.
I can't tell if you actually hate me or if this is just how you are, but I had fun hanging out with you.
So I don't care what you say, you're my friend.
And I hope you get into veterinary school because I like you, so there.
I got you something too.
A baby-naming book.
I hope it works out with Chris.
And if it doesn't, I hope it works out with someone.
We're gonna hug now.
- No.
- Yeah.
Ow!
You're hurting me!
Mm!
Lot of hot "D" in here tonight.
Ooh, look at that chunky hunky.
Go over there and talk to him and find out what his deal is.
No, I'm not gonna talk to some other guy.
When we're together, you can't check out other guys.
That's the deal.
Or else it's over between us, you understand?
Mm!
Tommy laying down the law.
A little feisty.
I like that, okay?
I'ma go get a soda.
Do you want to have sex somewhere after I do that?
- Sure.
- All right.
Well.
Looks like things with Mona-Lisa are Continuing.
Yeah.
I think I'm gradually transforming her from truly terrible to only kinda terrible.
It's the small victories, you know?
Indeed.
The small victories.
I know she's kind of a monster, but whatever.
I'm young.
She's sexy.
I'm just gonna see where this roller coaster goes.
Fair enough.
Is there anything else you need help with?
Have you learned how to ride a bike yet?
Yeah.
I'm 28 years old.
I'm proud of you, bud.
Thanks!
Ann Perkins.
Is that a happy "Ann Perkins," or is that a bad-news "Ann Perkins"?
Oh, happy.
Obviously.
The bad-news one sounds like this.
"Ann Perkins".
Oh.
Well, I've thought about it.
And I'm in.
I want to be a parent.
I want to raise a child, with all the ups and downs and challenges that comes with it.
Chris, this is so great.
- I'm so happy.
- Me too.
Well, I guess your uter-you and my uter-me are now our uter-us.
Don't make me change my mind.
Although we are all sad and deeply grossed out that the Pawnee Videodome is turning into a porno palace, I am happy to announce that the Pawnee government will be hosting a weekly movie night here at the Community Center.
There will be free screenings followed by a discussion led by local film buff Dennis Lerpiss.
Tonight's film is The Sound Of Music.
And action.
I'm glad you're here, Dong Swanson.
The local video store's about to go under.
We have to save it.
Oh, this is the wrong movie.
We ne-- shut this down, please.
- Shut it down.
- Sorry, Leslie.
I'm a strict libertarian, and I don't believe in bailouts.
This is not how it happened.
_
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
I'm looking for Ronald Ulysses Swanson?
He stepped out.
Can I take a message?
Sure.
Tell him he just won a free dinner from St. Elmo steak house.
I'm Ron Swanson!
You've been served.
Have a nice day.
I don't like you.
But I respect the effort.
Oh, man, subpoena?
Which ex-wife is it, Tammy one or Tammy two?
Neither.
Apparently councilman Jeremy Jamm is not pleased that I punched him in the face on the night of Leslie's wedding.
He's suing me.
$13,000 for orthodontic surgery, $6,000 for enamel repair, and $46 million for psychological damages.
Yeah, that seems about accurate.
That guy is the worst.
We should sue Jamm's parents for spawning a human turdburger.
Ron, hey, let me be your lawyer.
I'll object to everything anyone says, trial will go on forever, you don't have to pay.
Problem solved.
That's a kind offer, Andrew, but I won't be hiring an attorney.
I'll represent myself, as I do in all legal matters and livestock auctions.
I wish we had $46 million.
We could buy my parents' house and evict them.
Surprised he's taking it this well.
Aghh!
April, could you call maintenance please?
Parks and Recreation S05E17 Partridge Okay, move a little bit to your left and then turn to the side.
Okay, and freeze.
That is the exact spot where an 18-year-old Ben Wyatt was inaugurated as mayor of Partridge, Minnesota.
Oh, well, thank you very much.
Yes, congratulations to you.
- I don't know.
- I have chills.
Can't believe they're finally giving me the key to the city.
I can't believe it took so long.
They gave the key to every other mayor in the town's history, and I guarantee that none of them had as cute a butt as you do.
And none of them caused the city's unemployment rate to hit 30%.
You're so sexy when you talk about percentages.
When Ben was mayor, he sunk all of the town's money into a winter sports complex called "Ice Town," and they went bankrupt.
Now they've invited him back as a gesture of goodwill, and he'll finally get some closure on this miserable chapter in his life.
Yay, Ben!
Town hero!
- Yes!
- Whoo!
Well, if it isn't the defendant, Ron Swansuck.
Why are you doing this, Jamm?
This lawsuit is Chronicles of Riddick-ulous.
I'll tell you why.
It's 'cause I'm sick of this whole Parks and Rec gang.
That's why.
This munch throws me into a swimming pool.
The nurse still won't have sex with me, and she's not even queer.
Now Swansuck punches me in the mouth.
It's what we in the Jamm family call "Payback time".
Everyone calls it that.
Yeah, because I invented it.
Yeah, you're not gonna win $50 million, you freak.
Maybe not, but I'm not not going to win nothing.
Paul.
That guy is a joke.
This lawsuit is definitely getting thrown out.
I don't know, those are Jean-Ralphio's lawyers.
They once got him $60,000 'cause he got too scared at a haunted house.
Okay, are you done?
Are we done?
Did we win?
- You can't win this.
- You can win at anything.
Last year I won an organic gardening contest.
Who were you competing against?
My own taste buds.
I wanna have a baby, and Chris has agreed to be the father.
My fertility counselor showed me this online quiz that determines whether we'd be compatible parents.
If this were the '80s, all we'd have to do is, like, not drop an egg for a whole day.
Stupid Internet.
Okay, our official co-parenting score is Not amazing.
Oh, I think it's fantastic.
I think it's literally the best score we could have hoped for.
- Not sure that that's true.
- Oh, snap!
I just filled it out for fun.
Chris and I are 81% compatible.
You wanna make a baby, traeger?
Your hair, my everything else.
That kid would be unstoppable.
Guys, I couldn't resist.
I did it too.
Ann and I got 84%.
- Well, this sucks.
- Yes, we did not win.
So was, like, Ben a bossy older brother?
Did he make you watch star war movies?
Make me?
I loved those movies just as much as he did.
That's so cute.
Oh, you do a lot of hugging.
Yeah, get used to it.
We're sisters now.
Benji, I'm really glad you came back for this.
A lot of jerks around here didn't think you'd show up.
Well, I wasn't sure, but Leslie gave me the extra push, and I figured it'd be nice to put the ice town thing behind me once and for all.
Now that you're both here, let's get started.
Just have a few questions.
- You have a binder?
- That's right.
Who were Ben's high school girlfriends, and what base do you think he got to?
- Um - What's that?
And what exactly did you witness?
Defendant, alias Ron Swanson, alias my boss, used appropriate force to prevent further damage to the wedding of Leslie Knope, alias my other boss.
You sound as if you have a special interest in law enforcement.
Yes, sir.
In fact, at the time, I was trying to become a police officer but was deemed unfit for the force.
And what happened?
Don't know.
Well, I pooched the brain exam.
Just to be safe, I wouldn't take anything I say too seriously.
Next witness, your honor.
Ms. Ludgate, have you ever heard Mr. Swanson threaten to hurt councilman Jamm?
Ronny?
Are you kidding me?
I've never heard him threaten to hurt anyone or anything.
The guy's, like, a vegetarian.
Look at him, he's like a big, old, soft teddy bear.
His nickname around the office is "Softy-Pants McHuggable".
Did you ever hear Mr. Swanson say he intended to injure councilman Jamm before the day of the wedding?
The answer is a flat "no".
Ron doesn't really pay much attention to other people.
I doubt he even knew you existed.
Also, may I say for the record, that is a dope pocket square.
Can I see that bad boy?
Tom and April were excellent witnesses in my defense.
Unfortunately, every single word out of their mouths was a lie.
There's only one thing I hate more than lying.
Skim milk.
Which is water that's lying about being milk.
Despite everything that happened 20 years ago, this will always be my hometown.
Are you crying again?
It's just every time you say that speech, I think about where you've been and where you're going and our future children and America and just our history as a nation.
Wow, I didn't think about all that, but I thought it was good.
- Thanks, Steph.
Ah, I'm feeling sweaty.
Do I look swe-- I feel--oh, I need to use the bathroom one more time.
That's, like, five times in an hour.
Well, somebody's nervous about the ceremony.
I don't blame him.
He didn't exactly leave Partridge as the most popular guy in town.
Ben?
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
I think I'm giving birth.
Is that possible?
No, right?
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, God!
I'll call an ambulance.
Oh, God!
It's twins!
- I'm having twins!
- Oh!
Okay.
- Kidney stone?
- Big sucker too.
We're gonna have to keep him here until it passes.
Leslie and Dr. Clipperton Wow, man, I'm so glad you guys are meeting.
It's like worlds collide.
You know, I love it.
I want candy.
What is he on?
Morphine.
It's good stuff.
Leslie, come here.
Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?
I'm serious.
You're like a flower.
Or, no, like a snug-bug or like a snugger-doodle or something like that.
We should just go for it, you know?
Life.
We have a ceremony we need to be at in two hours.
Is there anything that we can do?
Sorry, Ice Town, you're not going anywhere for at least a day.
Okay, well, I'll call mayor Stice, and we'll reschedule the ceremony.
No, this town expects me to wuss out.
I'm making that speech, and I'm simply gonna explain to the crowd that love is everywhere and they have to surrender to the flow of the universe, you know?
Price Is Right is on, I think.
Oh, you remember staying home sick from school watching the price is right?
Oh, God.
Look, I know that this is just a silly quiz, but it is so discouraging to do so poorly.
Well, look, this is not the only way to see if we would be good parents.
I know it's a little lame, but I bought a dozen eggs at the grocery store, and I thought we could do that thing where we pretend the egg is a kid for a day.
That's a great idea!
I don't see them.
Oh, my God.
- I left them at the grocery store.
- Oh, boy.
I bought 12 babies, and then I immediately abandoned them at a Kroger's.
Look, we can use anything as a baby.
I mean, we could use this mug.
I don't understand.
I was great.
I was like Mark Z in The Social "N".
My testimony was amazing for your case.
But it wasn't the truth.
And neither was yours.
You even called me a vegetarian.
What if that testimony leaks?
How will people ever respect me?
Ugh, whatever.
The truth is stupid.
I only tell the truth when it makes me sound like I'm lying.
Yeah, lying is all I know.
It's how I was able to scrape by on the streets of Bombay and make it on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire and get reunited with the love of my life, Latika.
You could both take a lesson from Andrew.
He told the truth about everything he was asked, even when it was humiliating for him.
That's right.
I love telling the truth.
Case in point, sometimes when I blow my nose, I get a boner.
I don't know why.
It just happens.
Truth bomb.
I'm gonna call you both back in that room, and you'll recant your testimony.
- No!
- You committed perjury.
But more importantly, you've dishonored yourselves.
Oh, brother.
They are so young.
So much to learn.
- What are you talking about?
- I know, right?
Wisdom.
Sick?
Do you really expect me to believe that?
What has he got, acute wimping out?
No, he has kidney stones.
We have proof.
Yeah, I took a video of him at the hospital an hour ago.
I feel like I never gave miles Davis proper shrift.
Like, I just didn't get into it.
But the good news is I'm here to accept the key on his behalf.
Boy, it's just a real shame it had to happen today of all days.
Damn it!
Excuse me.
Hi.
Everything okay?
You want me to come back to the hospital?
Pfft, nah.
I'm goodie goodie.
You just do your thing, baby smurf.
I mean, I wish you were here.
It seems pretty fun and festive.
Town mascot is here.
Fred the Sled?
They only bring him out for special occasions.
I can't believe they're doing all this for me.
The universe is love.
Okay, stay away from sharp things.
Well, well, well, heard you want to recant your earlier statements.
Yes, I misremembered some things.
I did in fact hear Ron Swanson say he intended to injure Jeremy Jamm.
Boom, knew it.
- Tell us about it, please.
- Which time?
Well, how many were there?
Well Yeah, we did a trade.
I gave his wife new enamels, he gave my wife new yabbos.
Who's that gentleman?
Jeremy Jamm, city councilman.
- You don't know him?
- Never met him.
He looks like he could use a swift punch in the face though.
Yes!
And then before he can say anything, I just run over, shove him into the pool.
Bully for you.
If it were me, I would have just punched him in the face.
What's up, Ron?
Just daydreaming about punching Jamm in the face.
And there were a few other times too.
- We get the picture, son.
- Hold on.
We need your full, truthful testimony on record.
Keep going, Tom.
But now, 20 years later, the city has finally healed from the festering wound of Ice Town.
Today we put those horribly painful memories behind us as we welcome back the mayor who made all of that possible, Ben Wyatt.
Oh, that's a typo.
That's a major typo.
That says "Ice Clown".
I'm just realizing now that's not a typo.
Hey, aren't you his sister?
I gotta get outta here.
Good luck, Leslie.
Here to accept the key to the city of Partridge, because Mr. Wyatt is conveniently ill, is his wife Leslie Knope.
And it's water.
Uhoh, the key was made of ice.
And much like the hopes and dreams of the people of Partridge, it melted away.
Again, this would all be way more satisfying if Ben was here.
Okay, excuse me.
I would like to point out that we drove all the way here from Pawnee, Indiana, a city with some class, by the way.
And, sure, my husband made an honest mistake 20 years ago.
But it was very meaningful that you were gonna finally - Hi, Leslie.
- Be able to forgive him.
If it's so meaningful to him, then where is he?
He's in the hospital, sir.
He has a calcified rock lodged in his penis!
Frankly, Ben Wyatt is the best thing to ever come out of this crap town.
Oh, yeah?
What about Judy Garland?
Judy Garland's from Partridge?
She lived here for a while.
And Lee Janzen.
Who's Lee Janzen?
He's a golfer.
He's pretty good.
Well, Ben Wyatt's better than Lee Janzen, and he's better than Judy Garland.
That's crazy.
Judy Garland's amazing.
But Ben Wyatt is better than all of you because he cared about this town, and he tried to help it.
You know, screw you, Partridge.
And a sled is a stupid mascot.
Thank you, Ms. Ludgate.
It is now quite clear that on innumerable occasions Ron Swanson said he intended to punch councilman Jamm in the face, and then he did.
Yeah, but who cares?
He says a lot of things.
He's always talking about overthrowing the government, but he never does that.
Well, that'll make a nice pull quote for the article about me taking you to the cleaners.
Mr. Swanson, if you'd like to make a statement, you may.
On the night I punched councilman Jamm in the face, I warned him several times to back off.
And instead, he attacked me twice.
Truthfully, I barely registered his attack.
He's incredibly frail, and his arms are weak.
And when I punched him, he dropped so quickly, I thought he was diving towards the ground.
I regret nothing.
The end.
Well, this turned out better than I ever imagined.
You got Jammed by your own team.
Self-Jamm!
I'll see you in court, Swanson, and, uh, bring your checkbook.
I would like to punch you in the face again.
Okay, Paul, let's go.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Well, get your normal conversation in with me while you can.
Got about 20 minutes before I get all loopy again.
Mm, let me see the key.
Oh, uh, they took it back.
They wanted to get it engraved.
Huh.
You know, the key is just a metaphor.
I mean, the real key has been inside you all along.
It was a setup, wasn't it?
They were gonna make fun of me?
Yes.
Ice Town was a debacle.
They'll never get over it.
Just don't know why I got my hopes up.
It's so unfair.
You worked so hard.
You've done so many great things.
And for your hometown to treat you this way is just-- You know what, screw this.
We're gonna make one more stop before we leave.
Tuck in your shirt.
We're going to city hall.
So, Dr. Van Dyne, we took the compatibility test that you recommended, and we didn't do amazing.
But I'm sure that happens with a lot of couples, right?
And it's not like we failed.
We got a 58%, which as I'm saying it, sounds very clearly like we failed.
Look, there are many ways to judge compatibility.
Okay, you know what, let's do a little exercise.
I'm gonna say something about your future child, and then you just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Okay?
Gender.
- Girl.
- Boy.
Okay.
Religion.
- Buddhist.
- Whatever he wants.
Whatever he wants.
Um, how 'bout occupation?
- Teacher.
- Sixtime tour de France champion.
Really?
Okay, I'm sorry, are you guys complete strangers?
Is this one of those craigslist father situations?
No, no, no.
We actually know each other quite well.
Yeah, we used to date actually, but it didn't work out because we had some compatibility issues.
You know what, why don't we just try one more compatibility test?
- Great, let's do it!
- No, let's not.
Okay, well, we all told the truth, and Jamm's definitely going to win.
What do we do now?
I intend to do as the court orders.
Do you know if one can pay court-ordered settlements in gold?
All of my money's in gold.
I also have some money in palladium.
What if it's a huge amount?
Are you gonna be okay financially?
I think so.
I'm actually not sure how much money I have.
But I do know how many pounds of money I have.
Whoa, whoa, that is awesome.
Yes, it is, and I'm definitely tweeting that to Drake to use in his next rhymes, but still I kinda feel like this is our fault.
Ugh, do we have to do something nice now?
Let me start by apologizing, mayor Stice.
I had no right to disparage your town.
Well, I owe you guys an apology too.
I, uh, had a little bad publicity lately, and frankly, it's still really easy to score points by bashing Wyatt.
Can't you just give Ben a key to the city, here, now, in your office, where no one will know your shame?
- Sorry, babe.
- No worries.
I love you.
Aw.
You know, if people found out I gave Wyatt the key to the city, I would never get re-elected.
So no.
What are you doing there, Wyatt?
I'm feeding your eagle.
He's starving.
It's it's bronze, babe.
- Why?
- The eagle-- We should go.
- Yeah.
Ann Perkins.
I know it didn't seem to go very well at the counselor's.
But I have found a new quiz, and I think we should take it.
Are you sure?
Everything we do makes it seem like it's a bad idea for us to have a kid together.
Maybe we shouldn't even be friends.
Take a look.
"Will you love our child and work hard to see that he or she has a good life"?
You see, I think that's the only question that matters.
All the rest of it is details.
Yes.
The answer is yes.
I said the exact same thing.
We're 100% on the same page.
Are you sure about this?
You are caring, intelligent, and reliable.
And I am certain that you will literally be the world's best mom.
Wow.
This is really happening.
- You know there's nothing in there yet, right?
- Yes, sorry.
No, I was with Johnny Cougar Mellencamp at that music fest.
We both thought, biggest yabbos we've ever seen in-- What the hell?
That was important.
Game's over, councilman.
Drop the suit.
And why exactly would I do that?
We took a look at your affidavit.
We cross-referenced it with telephone records and eyewitness accounts, and, uh-oh, we found 11 lies.
Lying under oath is called perjury, and they should know, they did it yesterday.
Well, I mean, maybe I accidentally said something that wasn't-- Let me see that.
Ow!
My wrist!
You twisted my arm like a maniac!
- Oh, no!
- You monster.
Ow!
You assaulted me, and I'm injured!
Oh, my God, Tom, are you okay?
All right, you know what, I see what you're doing.
I barely touched you.
That's not what I saw.
My face!
Is my face still there?
What happened to my knees?
Someone please tell me if Tom is okay.
- Jamm, I'm gonna sue you.
- Okay, fine.
Hey, listen, keep your mouths shut about the affidavit, I'll drop the suit, okay?
Hurry, Tom, let's get you into surgery!
Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.
We got Jammed.
My friend Jack and I used to fish this lake in the summer.
One time, our boat almost tipped over, but then it didn't.
That's not a great story.
Yeah, I had a pretty uneventful childhood.
I got you something.
- No way.
- Yeah.
Where did you get that?
I stole it from mayor Stice's office.
Screw that guy.
You should have it.
You're the best wife in the world.
But I don't want this.
Really?
Yeah, I mean, I love Partridge, but I have Pawnee now.
And I have you.
Well, I'm not giving it back to Stice.
- That guy sucks.
- Yeah.
Well, you know what then?
Hey, lake's not a garbage can, pal.
Yeah, sorry, it was symbolic.
Is that Ben Wyatt?
Get the hell out of here, Ice Town!
- Run!
Run!
- Go, go, go, go, go.
Sorry.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Welcome to Animal Control.
Let me show you around.
Those are some chairs.
That's a cat or opossum.
Oh, this is a napkin where I wrote down a cool name for a dog.
"Bark Obama".
Right?
Is that-- what's happening here?
Oh.
Yo.
Yeah.
We found this bird outside.
We tried to turn it into a work whistle, like in the beginning of The Flintstones.
Tougher than it looked, though.
We have a massive pest problem in this town, and it's because the Animal Control Department has been disaster at catching animals.
They're great at ingesting and selling marijuana.
This place is a miserable suck hole run by two pot-head losers.
It's completely and utterly mismanaged.
Thanks!
It does seem to be very poorly run, but we've only been here for two minutes.
There may be a method to their madness.
There's more than one way to skin a cat.
Four.
There's four ways to skin a cat.
Regular blade-- Ow!
Ah!
What is this?
- Coyote trap, dude.
- Ah!
This hurts!
Yeah, we got, like, a huge vermin problem.
I mean, we've been meaning to call somebody about it, but you know, nobody get on the phone.
You're the people you would be calling.
That is so trippy.
Ow!
You're fired!
You're fired!
The whole department is fired.
Ow, this hurts!
This was one of my running feet!
- Yo, let's go to Jamaica.
- No, we should go to Jamaica.
Oh, is that what you said?
Yeah, dog.
Ron, you've been sweating in here all day.
Are you drinking any fluids?
Yes, plenty.
No, you need to drink water.
Usually, I take it neat, but I will make an exception in the name of health.
Last night, I watched a movie with Diane and the girls in which an orange fish is separated from his father.
The children were sniffling, which I believed to be due to the sad nature of the film.
I was wrong.
You need to take off those layers, rehydrate, and go to the doctor.
Thank you for your concern, I will be fine.
Please turn the thermostat up to 90 and leave me alone.
Ron, this isn't safe.
I am a grown man.
I have had a cold before, I need no help, so if you don't mind-- That seems about right.
Okay, pop quiz.
Name the scent.
Uh, "Spasm".
No, "Butter Face"!
- Very good!
- Yes!
I'm trying to get more big companies to donate to the Sweetums Foundation, and tom got us a meeting with Dennis Feinstein, Pawnee's premiere manufacturer of perfumes and cologne.
Oh!
Or possibly, insecticide.
Whew!
Dennis Feinstein belongs to a new generation of wealth-- rappers, tech geniuses, X games medallists, and of course, "scent artists".
The man owns a Rolexus.
It's a Lexus filled with Rolexes.
What's the point of that?
To have it, which he does.
Okay, I'll lay out the benefits of donating.
Tom will flatter and schmooze as only tom can.
Andy, you know, this is just a learning experience for you, so you just watch and listen.
I had to pull a lot of strings to get this meeting, so please, no one embarrass me.
Ben, put on something decent, like a tux.
Andy, you're hopeless, just take a shower.
I already took what I call a "dwyer shower".
I rubbed my armpits with air fresheners.
New car.
Animal control has long been a repository for some of this government's most incompetent employees.
Jerry Gergich got his start there.
- Well.
- All right, well.
Yeah, so our new director needs to be competent, effective, and not completely stoned all the time.
I'm way ahead of you there, girly.
I got the perfect guy.
Friend of mine, bit of an alcoholic, a little grabby, either a war hero or war criminal, depending on who you ask, but a good dude.
- How do you know him?
- I do his teeth.
A few coffee stains up front, but his canines are insane.
Gosh, Jeremy, he sounds perfect.
- Are his gums great too?
- Oh, yeah.
They are excellent, beet red.
I was being sarcastic.
I think we should open this to the floor - for more discussion.
- Uh, maybe you would like to explain this to her, please?
Traditionally, Leslie, the councilmen just kind of take turns on departmental appointments.
Yeah, this one is mine, then Dexhart, then you.
This whole place runs on dibs.
Are you kidding me?
You guys are all fine with this?
Well, Milton's asleep, but the rest of you?
This is how departments get mismanaged.
No.
We are going to be thorough.
I'm going to find a candidate, and I encourage you all to do the same, and then, we will interview all of them.
Boring!
"Boring" is my middle name, so my thoroughly vetted candidate is going to blow your candidate out of the water.
Oh, I guess I'm leaving.
Good to see you.
Great meeting!
I'd like to object again to being brought here against my will.
Okay, I'm just gonna double-check your form here.
Ron!
You redacted all the information.
- I answered some of them.
- For "date of birth," you wrote "springtime".
- Which is true.
- Everything you write down is confidential.
We need you to give real answers.
Fine.
How many drinks of alcohol do you consume a week?
- One.
- That's it, one drink?
One shelf.
- Do you exercise?
- Yes.
Lovemaking and woodworking.
Do you have any history of mental illness in your family?
I have an uncle who does yoga.
- Allergies?
- Cowardice and weak-willed men.
And hazelnuts.
Sexual history.
Epic and private.
Okay.
I'm gonna go get your doctor.
He's a rude, brash jerk.
You'll love him.
I'm gonna cut right to the chase.
I don't like charity.
I don't get it.
Feels to me like I'm giving money away, and getting nothing in return.
Well, that's not true.
You can really help your personal brand if you show that you're a mogul that gives as much as he gets.
If I give as much as I get, I'm giving $20 million.
Ay yi yi.
That's how much I'm worth, Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ah, he's disgusting, but I want to take his money and give it to needy people, so I'm just gonna keep on smiling.
Yay!
People who give to charity, they get amazing press.
- Huh.
- Like Bill Gates.
Have you ever heard of Bill Gates?
He lives in Seattle, guy with glasses.
Bill Gates?
I know who Bill Gates is.
Bill Gates is, like, a super nerd.
Is this some sort of nerd thing?
Are you calling me a nerd?
Uh, he meant Mark Cuban.
Cuban?
Now, that's the kind of guy I can hang out with-- Mark Cuban.
- Yeah.
- I'm interested now.
Keep talking.
Stay still.
"Don't think about how much this itches".
That's very good advice.
I have to say, this is the greatest search committee ever assembled to find a new Animal Control Department head.
Chris Traeger can do more with one foot than most people can do with three.
I'm not going to lie to you.
I needed that.
I know.
- April Ludgate is beautiful - Stop.
- You are talented - No.
But most importantly, you're passionate about animals.
That's true.
It's because I'm half wolf.
Okay, Donna, you took a look at all the resumes, so send in the best candidate.
Wassup?
I'm Harris.
I'm 33 years young.
I have my cousin Jason's truck for two more weeks.
I have one testicle-- whac-a-mole accident-- and I'm down to clown.
Harris, we know who you are.
I literally just fired you.
Oh, is this that job?
That's crazy!
Never mind.
Why would you think Harris would be the best candidate?
'Cause he's one of only two applicants with actual experience at animal control.
Uh-ohh.
Does that mean-- What up?
Yo, my name is Brett.
I like burgers, and also, I'm very high right now.
- Dude, this is hilarious!
- Oh, yo!
- We live together!
- Yo, we live in the same place!
- This is my boy!
- Hey, "Wyld Stallyns"!
You guys know why there are all those cops out there?
Where are the cops at?
- I gotta go.
- Yo.
A lot of charities waste their money on overhead, but we at the Sweetums Foundation, - spend our money wisely.
- Okay.
- You know what?
Shut up.
- All right.
You guys seem like pretty cool dudes and I'm feeling pretty generous, so why don't we take this conversation to the Pawnee Smokehouse?
Dumb-Dumb Eddie, get the checkbook.
We're going out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, we're going out.
Let's scent up!
I call dibs on "Ooze".
- I got "Money Shot".
- Yeah.
I got "Blood Spurt".
Ooh, no, don't use that one.
Eh, go ahead.
So why do you want this job?
Well, I love cats, and dogs sure are great.
Well, you have all the qualifications.
You went to a four-year college.
Actually, when I went there, it was just a two-year college.
Wow, so you're not even technically qualified to work at your current job.
Aw, geez.
- You're fired.
Get out.
- No, no, you're not fired, but we're definitely going to have to lower your salary.
Oh, well, fair's fair.
I am very, very, very, very frightened of animals.
This may not be the job for you.
I know, but my therapist, Dr. Richard Nygard, told me to confront my fears.
You see Dr. Richard Nygard?
I'm a Nygardian too!
Would you sign my cast?
Yes, but just please don't give me this job.
The spaying and neutering tools, do you think those fit humans?
- Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm.
- And is there a lock on the spaying room door?
Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm.
Thank you so much for coming in.
- Thanks for having me.
- Okay.
Hello, Orin.
Thank you so much for applying, now leave.
Hey, give him a chance.
What makes you qualified for animal control?
I studied zoology in college, and I can control animals with my mind.
- Get out.
- I made you say that.
I liked him.
Well, that was a truly depressing slate of candidates.
I think you've got several options.
They're all terrible, but you have them.
Before you begin, a few ground rules.
I need you to explain everything you do before you do it, so I can determine whether I will allow you-- Oh!
Ugh!
Balsa wood?
You could at least use mahogany.
There's something occluding your ear.
It's sawdust.
Just blow.
- Oh.
- You've got strep throat.
I'm writing you a prescription for penicillin.
We'll have the rest of your test results in about 20 minutes.
Cholesterol-- Not interested.
Good day.
Wish all patients were like that.
It's really annoying when they ask questions.
You know, they claim that smoking is bad for you, but is there any medical evidence to back that up?
- Great point.
- So the Sweetums Foundation has really accomplished a lot recently.
Our health care outreach program has reduced pink eye in the rural community by 30% to 70%.
Snooze.
You guys ever been fox hunting?
I have my own foxes flown in from Russia.
We drug them pretty heavily so they can't get very far.
In fact, mostly, they just flop around on the ground.
Makes it easier to just walk up and "pow"!
Stupid foxes.
It's deeply erotic.
That sounds amazing.
We should go hunting sometime.
I'd love to.
I could bust out my Ralph Lauren Fall 2010 collection.
Copped it in 2012.
Clearance rack!
Wear whatever you want, as long as it's not too bright or reflective.
You know, I want you blending in to the surroundings.
How fast can you run?
I think that guy wants to hunt me.
So, Dennis, not to interrupt-- Then don't.
Boom!
Ha ha!
Shut him right down!
I have heard so much talking from you.
I don't want to hear your fat mouth say anything else.
- Boo!
- Oh.
You're a dick.
Excuse me?
- Andy-- - How dare you talk to me like that?
Where are your manners?
You come to me asking for money, and you treat me like this?
I don't think so.
Wrap it up!
We're done!
Hey!
Show these garbage people out!
Take the garbage out, Eddie.
Donna?
Gentlemen.
Mr. Palletta, what is your occupation currently?
I run a children's break dancing studio called "D.J. Jazzy Vern's".
Do you have any experience with animals?
Uh, a bat landed on my face once.
Hey, you know what, he's not a rack of ribs, so stop grilling him.
Nailed it.
Ribs are better smoked than grilled, so un-nailed it, with the back part of the hammer.
How many more questions are there gonna be?
Jamm said if I got my teeth whitened, - I'd just get the gig.
- Uh, ga ga ga--ho.
Hold up, that's enough.
Thank you, you're done.
You did a heck of a job, Vernie.
Thanks, Jimbo.
Not bad, right?
I mean, if he can catch raccoons as well as he can teach six-year-olds to pop and lock, he's a home run.
That is an insane statement.
Well, I don't see anyone better.
April, I got a present for you.
I don't like lotion.
I like my hands to be cracked and calloused like a railway worker.
I know.
I filled the bottles with fake blood, vinegar, and mud.
- Really?
Thanks.
- On an unrelated note, do you remember all those candidates we were interviewing for the Animal Control job and how they were all total losers who didn't care about animals?
Except for Jerry, who was great, but who we had to pass on for other reasons.
I was just happy to be considered.
Anyhoo, I nominated you for the position, and your confirmation hearing is in three minutes.
- Surprise.
- No, I don't want the job.
You can have your mud and blood back.
April, please, you will be so good at it.
You are so good with animals.
Even if I wanted the job, I don't want to do the stupid confirmation hearing, okay?
Stupid councilmen asking me stupid questions about my stupid life-- it seems stupid.
No, it's easy--they'll just ask you a few questions.
Let's practice.
What's your name?
Batman.
See?
I failed.
I will be there to help you, okay?
I will be your Pocahontas.
Climb into my papoose.
Please do this.
Please, please.
Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
- Do it.
You're gonna do it.
- Okay.
- Yes!
Yay!
- But only if you divorce Ben.
Hey, don't even joke about that.
What?
I really think he's wrong for you.
We now resume the confirmation proceedings for director of the Animal Control Department.
Okay.
Let's tear this chick a new one, shall we?
Ms. Ludgate, we have found many emails showing how you sexually harassed Leslie Knope's assistant.
Andy?
That's my husband.
They were still extremely graphic, and appreciated by all of us.
I had never heard of several of those terms, and I'm a freak.
Those are personal.
No one's allowed to read those.
You once posted a video of yourself drinking alcohol in City Hall while you were still a minor.
How do you justify that?
Easily.
Alcohol is delicious and fun Damentally a substance that should not be abused.
I agree, April.
Very good point.
Wow.
Ms. Ludgate, are you a ventriloquist?
I mean, that is amazing how you make your words come out of Ms. Knope's mouth.
Would you like to put her on your knee?
I mean, that'd be really fun.
Just three years ago, you drove-- She's not ready.
Now, you've rushed her into this, and now, Jamm's sharpening the knives.
Leslie, no one needs to be jammed today.
Okay, all we need is some kind of distraction.
Grab that gavel and break your other foot.
I like the idea of double the signings, but I think the negatives outweigh the positives.
Don't panic.
Maybe she can pull this off.
I guess my first move as director would be to fill your office, house, and car with snakes, and then train a crow to fly up your butt.
Okay!
Let's take a brief recess.
Well, well, well.
Look who's back.
Thank you so much for seeing us again, sir.
We just came to apologize.
Mr. Dennis Feinstein, let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, my bad.
I just started working here, and I really want to do a good job, and I blew it.
Thank you for saying that.
Thought about it last night, and I decided that if you came in here and apologized to me like a man, that I would forgive you, and that's what you've done, so you're forgiven.
To that end, here is a check for $25,000 for your charity.
- Oh!
- Go out there and help some kids with their pink eye, or whatever it is you guys are doing.
Mr. Feinstein, thank you.
This is extremely generous.
It's nothing, really.
I'm happy to help.
This check is made out to "Go  yourself".
In your face!
Dennis Feinstein helps no man!
Get the hell out of my office!
- Hey, what's your problem, man?
- Why did you make me - apologize to him?
- Guys, guys, just hold it-- hold on a sec, okay?
Mr. Feinstein, with all due respect you are a major dick.
- What?
- Run!
- Eddie, get my crossbow.
- Crossbow?
What the-- You will pay for this!
Hey, you look better.
I guess actual medicine can be effective.
Who'da thunk?
Please leave me alone.
Not until we go over your test results and your blood work.
Your blood pressure looks fine.
I'm not sure how this is possible, but your cholesterol is 120, which is the lowest I've ever seen.
What's "cholesterol"?
And the only problem I see is that your potassium's low, so just eat a banana once in awhile.
No, thank you.
I live the way I live, I eat the things I eat, and I'll die the way I'll die.
That's oddly beautiful but also stupid.
You're not alone in the world anymore, Ron.
You're dating a woman who has two kids, so every three days, think about Ivy and Zoe and Diane, and eat a damn banana.
I am so sorry, April.
You are doing terribly up there, and it's all my fault.
It's not you, it's me.
- Are you breaking up with me?
- I'm breaking up with the idea of you being director of Animal Control.
I say we just withdraw your application and let Vern become director.
He does have good teeth.
No!
All right, I have an idea.
Trust me.
Ms. Ludgate, it is the opinion of this committee that you are terrible.
Can you give me even one reason why you're the right man for this job?
No.
But neither is your guy.
Neither of us should get the job.
Oh, no?
Why is that?
There shouldn't be a separate Animal Control Department.
Its budget is tiny, and it's ineffective, and frankly, no one could change that.
So I think it should be absorbed into the Parks Department.
That is a genius idea.
Somebody wake up Milton.
History is being made.
Iwo Jima!
Animal Control would be way more effective if it ran through the Parks Department, and if you want, I can write up an official report in language simple enough for even you dummies to understand, dummies.
Councilman, you have to admit that that idea makes a lot of sense.
Hang on a second.
You seem to be forgetting that I already told Vern he got the job, and he already bought a new speedboat.
Well, I hope he kept a receipt.
That was a brilliant idea from a dark, tortured genius, and I move that Animal Control be absorbed into Parks and Rec.
I second that.
Yay!
Look at that, April.
You won over Jamm.
Uh, no, she didn't.
I'm just sick of being on the losing side.
I'm going to tell everyone this was my idea.
Retro-jammed.
What do we do now?
Can I apologize again?
I'm getting really at apologizing.
Screw that.
You should apologize for apologizing to that guy.
God, we really could've used the money, though.
Just wish we'd made a bigger impression.
You did-- I was really impressed by all the stuff the foundation's done for all them poor homies, so you know what?
Rent-A-Swag is gonna donate five cents from every dollar we make this month.
It's not Feinstein money, but it'll help.
That's very generous, Tom.
Feinstein's the worst.
I hope he gets into an accident driving that Rolex Mobile.
For the last time, it's a Rolexus, and you can't drive it.
April, I have a gift for you.
Ta da.
At Leslie's suggestion, I have made you deputy director of Animal Control within the Parks Department.
You'll be amazing at it, and the best part, there is no confirmation hearing.
How did you make this plaque so quickly?
I had it made your first week here.
I knew you'd be going places, so I wanted to be prepared.
- Can I hire an intern?
- Not yet.
- Can I hire a Mexican elf?
- No.
- Can I buy a child bride?
- No.
Then how is this even a promotion?
Government shouldn't operate based on personal favors.
It should operate based on good ideas.
April had the best idea, and today the best idea won.
Leslie, I really have to go to the bathroom.
Oh, yeah, right, sorry.
You don't have to come in with me.
I wasn't going to.
Could you pick up the pace a little bit?
Oh, yes, Miss Daisy.
- Night, Ron.
- Night, Ron.
Ladies, ladies.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Ted!
Ted!
Ted!
Ted!
Ted!
Ted!
Article Two, Section Two of the Pawnee Charter reads, "Be it decreed: Should the taxation of tea "rise to an unacceptable level, citizens shall dump Ted into Ramsett Lake".
Does anyone object?
As always, I object.
Nay, enough dithering!
Dump the miscreant!
Boo!
Today is Ted Party Day, where we commemorate the great Pawnee tea dump of 1817.
Historical fun fact-- when the Founding Fathers wrote the charter, their old-timey script made one of the "a"s look like a "d," so "tea" became "Ted".
It's just one of those little things that reminds us of Pawnee's rich and vibrant past.
Plus, we get to go find a guy named Ted and throw him in a lake.
One!
I don't even go by Ted!
- Two!
- I go by Theodore!
- Three!
- Aah!
Hey, Ted.
Great job today.
You were so funny when you were like, "My cell phone, I left it in my pocket".
Then you checked it, remember, and it didn't work.
Yeah, that was hilarious.
Listen, I am just here to say that I am done with Ted Party Day.
- Ha!
Classic Ted.
- I'm serious.
I'm not getting dumped in that lake anymore.
And I talked to the other Teds in town, and they're not doing it either.
Come on, Ted Party Day is protected by Article Two in the town charter.
And we have the right, nay, the obligation, to dump Ted into the lake every year.
That's the way it's always been done.
Okay, first of all, "That's the way it's always been done" is not a good reason to keep doing something.
Second, it was a misprint.
They clearly meant "tea".
I just think you need to be careful about speculating what the Founders meant when they were writing the town charter.
Okay, fine.
You want to enforce every single old law we have on our books?
Hey, can I see your keys for a second?
Here's a quarter.
I own your car now.
- Wha-- - Sorry.
The Pawnee Charter clearly states that any white citizen has the right to seize any Indian property for 25 cents.
That is an outdated and racist law.
And obviously they meant "American Indian".
Whoa, I think we should be careful when we speculate what the Founders intended when they wrote the charter.
Okay, Ted.
I know what you're doing.
You're quoting me back to me.
But I'm gonna quote me back to you and say that Ted Party Day will never change.
Uhoh.
You, a woman, just raised your voice to a landowning male.
According to a Pawnee statute passed in 1868, I get to do this.
I was not aware of that statute.
Ron, you have to help me.
Chris is making me do some stupid management training leadership course.
Now that you run the Animal Control department, you have qualified for the Chris Traeger Management Training Seminar or "Ka-tumts".
It's not a great acronym, but it is a great seminar.
Can you get me out of it?
Yes.
Normally, if given a choice between doing something and nothing, I'd choose to do nothing.
But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing.
I'd work all night if it meant nothing got done.
Ron Swanson and April Ludgate, literally my two favorite people in the catalogued universe.
April will not be participating in your pointless course because she has more important things to do like not participating in your pointless course.
I just want April to become as great a department head as yourself.
Which is why this is pointless.
I've been head of the Parks department for 12 years, and I never had any "management training" course.
Ron, you've never been "ka-tumtsed"?
I am legally required to ka-tumts every department head.
Otherwise, we are open to all kinds of liability.
What are you saying?
I'm saying that tomorrow during the seminar, April is going to have a classmate.
And spoiler alert-- - it's Alf.
- It's you.
This went poorly.
What, no.
Damn it!
What are you bidding on?
It better not be Terrence Howard's tank top from Hustle & Flow.
- It is not.
- Good.
'Cause I am bidding on it and I am ready to spend an amount that my accountant calls "Dangerous and irresponsible".
JJ's diner put an old waffle iron up for auction.
It's the perfect breakfast day gift for Leslie.
"Breakfast day"?
Leslie has anniversaries for everything.
"Zoo day," first time we went to the zoo together.
"Double date day," it was the first time we went on a double date.
"Daniel Day-Lewis day.
"Talk-like-a-pirate day.
Talk-like-a-Pittsburgh-pirate day," which why and how?
This calendar was last year's calendar day present celebrating the first time she ever bought me a calendar.
You have to buy a present for every one of these?
She always tells me not to, but then she buys me something that's awesome and thoughtful, and then I feel terrible.
But that's the thing.
This is the perfect present.
I just keep getting outbid by someone named "Tall Tie-ree-on Lannister".
What kind of name is Tie-ree-on anyway?
You're kidding, right?
Tyrion Lannister?
Lord of Casterly Rock?
The Half-Man?
You don't watch Game of Thrones?
- No.
You do?
- Hell yeah.
Have you seen those Dothraki dudes?
They can get it.
Everybody on that show can get it.
I think I know who I'm bidding against.
I now realize that I was wrong, and it's time that we purged the books of many of our town's outdated and obscure laws.
The bill that I have written with the full support of the city council will repeal 110 obsolete laws such as all menstruating women shall be confined to their bathtubs and Article Two, aka, Ted Party Day.
The floor is now open for public comments.
Oh, here we go.
Thank you.
My name is Garth Blundin, and I object to your ridiculous proposal.
The Pawnee Charter shall not be changed.
Not today, not ever!
Wow, a lot of passion, Mr. Blundin.
Thank you so much.
Your objection is noted and officially in the record.
- Shall we proceed to a vote?
- No.
No, we shall not.
Article Seven, Section Three allows for a "Citizen filibuster".
If I stand here and refuse to yield my time, you are prohibited from voting on the bill.
That section defines "Buffalo meat" as acceptable currency.
- Is that the Buffalo meat one?
- Mm-hmm.
I meant Article Three, Section Seven.
Let the filibustering begin.
I would now like to share some ideas I have for J.J. Abrams' seventh chapter in the Star Wars' saga.
Pan down from the twin suns of Tatooine.
We are now close on the mouth of the Sarlacc Pit.
After a beat, the gloved Mandalorian armor gauntlet of Boba Fett grabs onto the sand outside of the Sarlacc Pit and the feared bounty hunter pulls himself from the maw of the sand beast.
Ugh, he's right.
He can do this.
This is exactly why we need to modernize these laws.
This kind of thing made sense when we had council in a barn and there were but now this is nuts.
If he holds the reality gem, that means he can jump from different realities.
This will be our link to the Marvel Universe from the Star Wars Universe.
Imagine those who were up against Chewbacca 'cause that's gonna happen.
After a beat, Luke says, "Darth Vader was my father, but Ben Kenobi was my master".
And he cuts Hannibal Lecter in half.
Mr. Blundin, look, the laws I'm trying to get rid of have no more relevance in modern society and they're embarrassing to Pawnee.
Repealing them would show that we're changing with the times.
You can't just change the charter willy-nilly.
You start by casually repealing a couple of "old laws," the next thing you know, your jack-booted storm troopers are kicking in my door and arresting my wife for no reason if I were married.
By "jack-booted storm troopers," do you mean the Pawnee Police Department?
- Hey, Clyde.
- Hi, Leslie.
Good Danish today.
The Pawnee charter is not a "living document," Ms. Knope.
You have no respect for the traditions of this town.
I absolutely do.
I used to give tours at the Pawnee Historical House.
Three times, "Employee Of The Fortnight".
Oh, big deal, you put on a costume for a couple hours.
By that logic, every time I go to bed at night, I am Wolverine.
You bought X-Men pajamas?
I won them, madam, in a raffle.
The point is is that our Founding Fathers were brilliant and they were courageous, but they also had wooden teeth and pooped in holes in the ground.
It was a more primitive time.
It was a better time.
You wouldn't have survived two weeks in their day.
Oh, really?
How about a little wager?
How about you and I go live in that historical house, no modern technology, If you last longer, I withdraw my bill.
I win, you stop this nonsense.
You have yourself a deal.
Please write down what you hope to gain from the seminar, seal it in the envelope, and then we'll open it when it's over.
When is this over?
As soon as you learn to embrace the power of positive motivation.
It's a nine-hour seminar over two days.
- Whoa!
- Oh, good.
All right, let's begin.
Hop on board "The Management Train".
First stop-- Motivation Station.
All aboard!
Stop bidding on my waffle iron.
You're FutureMrsTigerWoods?
I made that profile, like, ten years ago.
I don't know how to change it.
The point is I'm getting that waffle iron for Leslie for breakfast day.
Uh, no, you're not.
I'm getting it for her for waffle day.
Wait, you have a breakfast day too?
- Mine's in June.
- Please, Ben.
This is the celebration of the anniversary of the first time we hung out at JJ's, which she considers the beginning of our friendship.
Well, imagine being married to her.
It's like being smothered with a hand-quilted pillow filled with cherished memories.
I can't believe I'm complaining about how thoughtful my wife is.
Sorry, honey.
I love you.
Look, I have known her for longer, I have five years' worth of anniversaries, so I have seniority.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
- We've lost the auction.
- What-no.
Somebody swooped in at the last second, - and now we're both screwed.
- No.
Okay, Tyrion Lannister, why don't you just cast a spell and get us the waffle iron back?
Oh, okay.
I don't even have time to tell you how wrong you are.
Actually, it's gonna bug me if I don't.
The Lannisters, while very wealthy, do not possess the magical abilities of, say, the warlocks of Qarth for example.
This is why we don't hang out.
Think of yourselves as engineers steering a locomotive of positivity that runs on team power.
First of all, you don't "steer" a locomotive.
The tracks do.
Second, there are only three ways to motivate people-- money, fear, and hunger.
Oh, I disagree.
What about encouragement, appreciation, and smiles.
When people feel supported, they will literally explode with productivity.
Can you guys just figure out which way is better and tell me so we can leave?
Thank you for your input, April, but the ka-tumts requires that we follow a very specific syllabus.
You're not being very inclusive, Chris.
I feel like my input isn't being appreciated.
You've killed my spirit.
My spirit blood is on your hands.
My God, I've taught you so much already.
Ron, I propose a challenge to see whose motivational methods are more effective.
Challenge accepted.
I don't want to seem overdramatic, but this is literally a battle for April's soul.
I don't want to seem overdramatic, but I don't really care what happens here.
Oh, God.
I hate this place.
Everything is old.
Old things are dumb.
It's like, just be new.
I don't know, Tom.
I think there's some pretty cool things from back then.
That is a dope bonnet.
Oh, just getting here, I see.
Yikes.
Did you sleep here last night?
Indeed.
I want to be here when the cock crows to get the chores done.
Already, I've done the preserves and chased off an interloping cable installer.
Okay, well, let's put all modern devices in this pail.
Nothing can be used that was invented past 1817.
Andy, Tom, you will be our referees.
Thank you for volunteering.
Definitely didn't volunteer.
I had much better things to do.
Leslie said she'd pay me And I had nothing better to do.
I'm doing it for free.
There's no way I'm losing this contest.
Old-timey dress?
Check.
Extensive knowledge about early prairie life?
Right here.
Rickets?
Cured.
Don't need to worry about rickets.
Antiperspirant?
Not allowed.
Might get a little rough in there.
I was wondering if you could help me out.
Say no more.
Here's a bunch of guns.
Nope.
Different thing.
I saw that you recently won an auction for the JJ's diner waffle iron.
And I'd like to-- that's it right there.
- I'd like to buy it.
- You and everyone else.
Hello, Ben.
Seems like I love Leslie more than you do.
- Get in line.
- Yeah.
Get in line, pal.
- Who are you?
- I'm Roz.
I'm Leslie's mailwoman, and I need to get her a Mail Day present by next Wednesday.
It's the anniversary of the first-- Time you delivered her mail.
Yeah, we get it.
Looks like we've got ourselves an old-fashioned pawnshop waffle iron bidding war.
Let's start the bidding at $650,000.
Okay, I'll counter with 100 bucks.
I'll let you take anything - out of this bag.
- I'll tell you what, Ann.
I'll give it to you if you go - on a date with me.
- Oh, God.
I can't believe I'm about to do this, but fine.
One date.
But let me make one thing perfectly clear-- - 500 bucks.
- Sold.
- What?
- You still want to go out?
I just come into some money.
$500 buys a lot of nitrous.
Yeah, nothing warms the blood like an old whirly-bout with the old butter-gyre, - eh, Leslie?
- Indeed.
Man, this guy's tougher than I thought.
I don't know how either of you guys are doing this.
One time my refrigerator stopped working, I didn't know what to do.
I just moved.
I just don't think he's ever gonna quit.
He has that look in his eye that Ben gets when he plays Risk.
Oh, wow.
That is really good.
- Andy.
- No, I'm sorry.
This tastes great.
All my favorite foods have butter on 'em.
Pancakes, toast, popcorn, grapes.
Butter is my favorite food.
Well, then you're gonna love what I'm churning up.
Take a look at-- Oh, my God.
This is horrifying.
Nobody eat that.
I think I'm in over my head.
Garth really knows his stuff.
He planted an entire field of barley.
How long is he planning on staying here?
Hey, um, aren't we husband and wife in this scenario?
- I mean, like, shouldn't you-- - Not a chance.
Okay.
Wait, what's that?
Do you guys feel that?
Aah!
How long was that under there?
Man, Garth is a machine.
He brought his own whale blubber to light the lamps.
I thought he was gonna last an hour max.
It's like he's getting stronger the longer he stays here.
Whee!
Look at my hoop, Leslie.
Look at my hoop!
Ugh!
Who could live like this?
No one.
That's why we've moved on.
It's fun to be here on, like, a school field trip or something.
- It's so, so, so fun.
- So, so fun.
But to live like this is insane.
He must have cheated somehow.
I mean, there's no way a man who's into X-Men that much can stay away from the Internet that long.
We should check his phone.
Goodness, how delicious eating goober peas Jerry Gergich.
I need you to stop whatever it is you're doing and file as many of these as you can.
Wow, Duraflex cut-top A350s in deep maroon?
The honor is all mine.
Well, I knew you were the man for the job.
You are smart and capable.
And I believe you can accomplish anything.
Thank you so much.
You got it, champ.
Get filing.
Aye, aye, Captain.
That is one motivated worker bee.
You guys doing experiments on Jerry?
Yes.
Cool.
Got it.
Okay, now let's not read anything.
That's an invasion of his privacy.
Let's just look at his browser history and his inbox and his outbox and his Facebook page.
Yeah, he doesn't have any new emails.
Oh, my God.
It's true.
He hasn't gotten an email in Is he a ghost?
The only ones he gets are spam.
And he responds to them.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, man.
This guy has no friends.
I don't know.
Seems like he's friends with that mule.
What's that?
Well, since I can't give her a waffle iron for breakfast day, I am making her a miniature Leslie - out of breakfast food.
- Good lord.
Well, listen, I've been thinking.
How would you feel about going in - on the waffle iron together?
- Seriously?
That would be great, but whose holiday are we celebrating?
Well, I think I may have a plan that'll get us out of breakfast day and waffle day and all the other days without making us seem like ungrateful people who are annoyed at how amazing Leslie is.
Dude, whatever it is, I'm in.
- Okay, great.
- What should I do with this?
Just burn it and bury the ashes and pray it doesn't haunt you.
Jerry, stop filing those red folders at once.
Begin filing these blue ones.
Oh.
Sorry, Ron.
I promised Chris that-- This is the top priority.
I need these blue folders done now.
You can eat when you have finished.
File!
Oh, my goodness.
Money, fear, hunger.
Hey, there, Garth.
Whatcha whittling?
A birthing stick.
What's that?
- You do not want to know.
- Oh, my God.
You look beautiful.
I mean, you changed clothes.
Violation.
I-I challenge - you are bonnetless!
- Yes, you're right.
I admit, I can't take it anymore.
You win.
Huzzah!
The day is mine.
- I'm gonna miss saying "huzzah".
- Yeah.
Garth, I have another proposition.
Yes, I will go out on a date with you, but I realize you're a modern woman, so I will let you pay.
No.
I was wondering would you like to join the Pawnee Historical Commission?
Those clowns?
No thank you.
They haven't answered a single one of my complaints about their anachronistic use Well, I'm a member, and I think we could really use you.
But the only problem is there's tons of meetings, lots of work with people who also love history, and many social occasions that you're gonna have to attend, like cocktail parties and such.
I can understand if it's something you don't want to commit to.
Just sounds like such a big bite out of my soap-making time.
My cousin's arraignment is in May.
But that's a day.
I just fly out, I come back the same day.
On a trial basis, yes.
Yes, yes.
Great.
Welcome to the team.
Garth dropped his protest, and we were able to get rid of all the outdated laws in the town charter.
I mean, the charter is a wonderful document, but we've had the benefit of almost 200 years of learning and advancing.
Seems to me we ought to use it.
I did not change Article Two, though.
I just couldn't vote against a good, old-fashioned lake dunking.
Though Garth and I did come up with a compromise that I think will make everybody happy.
From this year hence, a volunteer will represent Ted in our town's most historic and cherished tradition.
This year, the honor goes to Mr. Garth Blundin!
Huzzah, I'm Ted!
I'm Ted!
I'm Ted too, guys.
- Andy!
- Yeah!
He's naked, everybody!
Put that away!
- We're all Ted!
Yeah!
- No, Andy!
Whoo!
Thank God.
I don't know how to swim.
Okay, final tally.
- Jerry filed 268 red files.
- Yes!
And 384 blue files.
- Yes.
- Wait a minute.
How is that possible?
Well, he was so happy when you told him he was doing a great job that he spent 20 minutes on the phone telling Gayle about it.
- And the prosecution rests.
- Not so fast.
He may have filed more blue ones, but they're almost all filed wrong.
Not surprising since he was a mess after you talked to him.
Another fascinating edition of "ka-tumts".
We may never know conclusively which way works better.
But I do know this-- When we first started the seminar, I hoped to be able to engage you in the process.
And by that measure I succeeded.
And I predicted that I would learn nothing from this process.
Mission accomplished.
What did April write?
Where is April?
"I will pit Ron and Chris against each other.
They'll argue about dumb stuff that doesn't matter, and I will bail.
Then I'll steal $20 from Chris's wallet and buy pizza with Andy.
Oh, and I'll also steal Ron's watch, just for fun.
I think April will be a fine manager.
I agree.
It's my favorite kind of battle-- Two men enter, one me leaves.
- Happy waffle day.
- Happy breakfast day.
Oh, my God!
You guys, this is the best Breakfast Day/Waffle Day joint present I have ever received.
Wow.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
But Ann and I wanted to tell you that this is the last Breakfast Day and Waffle Day we'll be celebrating.
Wait, what?
Oh, my God.
You're both dying.
No, no.
We just can't keep up with all the anniversaries.
It's too much, especially 'cause you're so good at them.
I'm no better at them than you are.
That's ridiculous, I'm so much better.
Point taken.
But we have a compromise.
Every year, there will be one day, "Ann Day," where you can celebrate all of Ann's holidays and "Ben Day" where we can celebrate all of ours.
What about Ann Month and Ben Month?
How about a week?
Fine.
We went in with a day, figuring she'd counter with a month.
We were fine with a week.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
But there will be a third week.
It will be called Friend Week.
It will be commemorating this week, the week that my two best friends became each other's best friends.
I have a Friend Week present for you right now.
Here you go.
How did you already have these?
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hey.
I didn't find the article about you teaching sex-ed to seniors, but I did find this folder labeled - "Senior sex-ed thank you notes".
- Oh, don't open that.
There's pictures in there.
Oh!
There are pictures.
There are lots of pictures.
Why would you not throw these away or incinerate them?
Because every memory deserves to be chronicled.
Even the saggy ones.
I am putting together a scrapbook commemorating my first year on the city council.
This year whizzed by so fast.
There was so much more I wanted to do.
But time is the relentless and cruel enemy of the devoted civil servant.
It's actually one of the sub-titles of my scrapbook.
Probably would've got more stuff done if I hadn't spent so much time brainstorming scrapbook titles.
Ben and Leslie's day off.
Let's go relax.
I cannot wait for our day off.
But what if we took a day on and stayed here and worked on some projects?
- That sounds pretty sexy, right?
- No.
Leslie, you've worked nonstop.
Holidays and weekends.
You're just gonna take a day off.
- It'll be good for you.
- All right.
You're cute.
- And you're right.
- Come on.
- Let's relax.
- All right.
Hey, April.
I'll be gone for the next 19 1/2 hours, so can you water my plants in my office?
We are all out of water, actually.
I'll have to use boiling hot milk.
- Are you really gonna do that?
- Yes.
Well, everybody.
Um, wow.
It has been an honor and a pleasure to work with you all.
The time I have spent at Parks and Rec have been the happiest days of my life here in the government.
And I know everyone says it, but I sincerely hope that we stay in touch.
What the  is happening right now?
Today's my last day, Leslie.
I'm retiring.
What?
Why didn't you tell us?
Well, I didn't want to make a big fuss.
Although, gosh, I'm pretty sure I mentioned it a few times.
Oh, God, they're gonna fire people, aren't they?
Yeah, I am two years from my pension.
Can you believe it?
Only six months left until I retire.
Ooh.
What did Jerry say?
Jerry was here?
Well, this is my last weep.
Oops.
I mean, "weep".
Week.
Jeez.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just wait.
Everybody wait.
Okay.
As much as we want this to happen, we can't let Jerry just disappear.
We have to commemorate this somehow.
You're right.
Jerry, thank you for your service.
Good-bye.
Thanks, Ron.
That speech means a lot.
Okay, well, I am going to go and say good-bye to some other folks.
Okay, see you tomorrow, Jerry.
So we ran all your tests, and everything looks great.
You might be the healthiest human being we've ever seen.
You have the resting heart rate of a 100-year-old tortoise.
Yes, I get that a lot.
So my childhood illness-- there's no chance I would pass that on?
It wasn't genetic, so you shouldn't worry at all.
You have every reason to expect a healthy child.
In fact, if you'd like, you can provide your sample today.
Today?
Like, today, today?
- This today?
- Well, yes.
I mean, the timing is right according to Ann's ovulation schedule.
Unless there's a reason you'd like to wait till next month.
No.
None.
One other question.
Completely off topic.
Would I be providing this sample today?
Here I am thinking about how fast my first year in city council has gone, and Jerry has had 40 years whiz past him with nothing to show for it.
This is everything in his file-- a handicapped parking sticker from when he got gout, a Parks and Rec golf cart driving exam which he failed, a scathing performance review.
I mean, why would anyone be so mean?
Oh, wait.
I wrote this.
I stand by it.
Well, Jerry was never really the type to rise above mediocrity or to it.
That's what I thought, but when he started, he had a lot of dreams and goals.
I mean, look at his original entry paperwork.
He wanted to meet the mayor, have a building named after him.
I just can't let Jerry leave here with nothing and go home to an empty life.
Well, I'll help with anything.
Just promise we'll do it quickly.
I'm making us a mac and cheese pizza for-- - Mac and cheese pizza?
- Yeah.
- You're making that?
- Yeah.
Torturing Jerry was my favorite thing in the world.
After making out with you.
Remember when we did both at the same time?
It made him so uncomfortable.
This is a sad day.
Who are we gonna make fun of now?
No need to worry.
Every place I've ever worked in has had a "Jerry".
When one Jerry leaves, the office naturally selects a new Jerry to fill that role.
It's Social Darwinism.
The strong prey on the weak.
Soon, one of you will be ridiculed mercilessly.
Ah, nature.
Okay.
My transfer was approved.
So starting now, I am an employee of the County Health Board.
You are no longer my boss, and we can have a baby without being a conflict of interest.
Clear sailing.
Goodbye, Ann Perkins, my excellent employee.
Hello, Ann Perkins, my fallopian princess.
So here's the drill.
Make a deposit in here.
If you fill it up all the way, you get on the board.
Then we take the sample, spin it in the centrifuge, and prepare it for fertilization.
Sounds romantic.
I guess it's go time.
Go time!
Wait, what am I doing?
I don't go with you.
Oh, no, no.
I go in alone with this pornographic disc and do it myself.
And you stay out here and try not to think about what I'm doing in there.
And I try not to think about you waiting out here trying not to think about me.
Should I think about you?
This is so weird.
Chris, we don't have to do this today.
This was totally just sprung on us.
Let's just take a moment.
There's so many pamphlets to look at.
Yes, we do have very important pamphlet reading to do.
Excellent idea, Ann Perkins.
Do I keep this?
I don't know.
It feels wrong to leave it here.
Give it to me.
I panicked.
Run!
Here are the last of the Animal Control reports.
What are you doing, weirdo?
Just trying not to spill anything.
I believe Leslie said to organize these by year.
Way ahead of you.
I made two pile files.
Pilo fibles.
Ugh.
Filo pilos.
Filo pilos?
That's not right.
- Are you broken?
- No, everything's fine.
Well, I guess that settles who the new Jerry is.
No, it doesn't!
I barely even said it wrong.
- Said it wrong.
- Stop it!
This is how it begins.
The next "Jerry".
One screwed-up sentence, and 30 years later, I'm wearing aquamarine sweater vests and listening to Bonnie Raitt and The da Vinci Code on my iPod.
It's already started.
Believe it or not, Jerry, you were young once.
Young and full of dreams.
I forgot I wrote all this.
And as unrealistic and absurd as those goals were, we are not letting you retire until we help you achieve them.
So let's see what's first.
"Eat in city council private dining room".
That we can achieve.
Right now?
Sure.
Let's go.
Authorized personnel only.
Oh, they're with me.
City Councilor Leslie Knope, clearance level four.
Guests are only allowed on Wednesdays.
And we don't have clearance levels.
I know, but shouldn't we?
I mean, it sounds so cool.
Anyway, we just need to get in there real quick and maybe take a picture.
He's retiring as a city hall employee after 41 years, and it was his dream to eat here.
His dream?
Really?
- Still no.
- It's okay, Leslie.
Come on.
But thank you.
Thank you for trying.
No, no, no, no, no.
I promised you an executive meal and you're gonna get one.
Ben, just--okay.
I'm gonna go in there and take a picture with Jerry.
I put my arm around nothing.
And then you Photoshop him in later, okay?
Congratulations on your retirement.
Aw, thank you.
One, three, seven, two, five, nine.
Pffft!
Sudoku is easy.
Is there even rules to this game?
There's a natural successor to Jerry's sad, smelly crown.
And it's not me.
It's Andy.
Big guy?
Check.
Goofy?
Check.
All I have to do is wait for a textbook Dwyer screw-up, which usually happens, mm, every 20 minutes.
Hey, if it isn't Filo Pilo.
Oh, real creative, Donna.
You expect that to catch on?
Babe, the pen.
Look at Andy.
There's ink all over him.
Andy's the new Jerry.
Game over.
Awesome.
Hey, I'm like a giant squid.
- Hey, honey, I'm ink Dracula.
- No, stop.
Squid Dracula is going to get you.
Barking up the wrong tree, Filo.
What do you mean?
Andy will never be the new Jerry.
Nothing embarrasses him.
He's like a giant puppy with no shame.
What you need is some fresh meat in the office.
Or you guys could just stop making fun of me.
Yeah.
No.
Okay, on to the next Jerry goal-- meet Mayor Knudson.
Oh, yeah.
He was the mayor at the time.
I've always wanted to meet him.
Well, today you're getting that chance.
So was he like - a really great mayor?
- No, not really.
He resigned because of corruption and racketeering, and then he died from an overdose of pills.
But actually his real cause of death was being thrown out of a helicopter while handcuffed.
Some people say he's still alive because they never found the body, but they never found the body because he exploded on impact.
- Sounds like a good dude.
- Yeah.
I just wish I had a chance to meet him, you know, years ago before all the scandals and his death.
But this is nice too.
- Yeah.
- Is it?
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.
It is.
Okay, go over there.
Let's meet Mayor Knudson.
I'll take your picture.
Butterflies.
Hello, Mr. Mayor.
First of all, I'm so sorry that those Serbian mobsters shoved you out of that helicopter.
You deserve better.
Okay, you tried, but I took a day off to spend with you, not with you and Jerry and a dead mayor.
Can we please just call it a day?
No, we can't because in a few short years, we're gonna be visiting Jerry here, and he will have achieved nothing.
Is that what you want?
- No.
- Okay, then.
It's really been nice to meet you.
- Okay, Jerry, let's go.
- Ooh.
Ronfire of the vanities.
Filo Pilo.
Are you kidding me?
Listen, now that Jerry's gone, we need to hire someone to pick up the slack.
A new person in the office?
Not a person.
An intern.
Why on earth would I get an intern?
Interns cost nothing to the taxpayer.
And more importantly, they're usually stupid and terrible.
So they get no work done.
It's like a Jerry you don't have to pay.
Damn, son.
That is one compelling argument.
Keep it up, Filo.
We may destroy this government one day after all.
These pamphlets are fascinating.
It says here that some men gain "sympathy weight" when their partners get pregnant.
If that happens to me, I'd be miserable.
But happy.
But sad.
I would have never imagined the baby-making process to be this clinical.
I mean, imagine if actual sex were like this.
Let me remove my clothes so we may begin to engage in physical activity to multiply our genes.
And it's also weird because we dated and we remember what it's like to engage in some of those - physical activities.
- Exactly.
And we were also pretty good at those physical activities.
Yes, we were.
Yes, we were.
You know, is this all the pamphlets?
'Cause I think that maybe I have some left in my bedroom.
Oh, well, then, we should definitely go look for those.
- Let's find those.
- We need to find those.
Hurry.
Okay, everyone gather around.
Leslie, I really appreciate this, but I did promise Gayle I would leave by 5:00.
She has a tasty surprise waiting for me, if you know what I mean.
Gross, Jerry.
She made a meatloaf.
Well, this is better than meatloaf.
When Jerry first applied for this job, one of this goals was to have a building named after him.
Again, that is an absurd request considering your work record.
But I thought maybe he could have a room named after him.
So henceforth, Parks and Rec conference room will serve as a testament to your years of public service.
- Oh, my God.
- Hear, hear.
"Jerry Gergich Memorial Conference Room.
R.I.P."?
Oh, the guy at the plaque store thought you had died.
It was a rush job, so we didn't have time to change it.
It doesn't matter.
We can just pretend it means retire in peace.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.
- So bring out the cake!
- Oh.
Speech, speech, speech.
Well, thank you, guys.
I'm not much of a speechmaker, but I do like good cake.
Delicious.
Uh, you're on fire.
Oh!
Oh, my God, Jerry!
Whoa.
Well, that went roughly as well as I thought it would.
I promised Gayle I'd leave at 5:00.
I guess this is it.
Bye.
See you tomorrow, Jeremy.
Well, pretty heroic, huh, guys?
Hard to make fun of that.
Oh, man, the cake.
Filo Pilo ruined the cake.
Classic Pilo.
What how is that my fault?
Stupid Jerry.
Should have never saved his life.
Hey, Jerry.
Do you have a second?
Leslie.
Well, this is a lovely surprise.
Come on in.
Have breakfast with the family.
That's okay.
I just popped by to apologize and to give you something.
- Is that Leslie Knope?
- Yes.
Oh, hi, Gayle.
What a surprise.
I insist you join us for breakfast.
This guy is the greatest breakfast chef in the world.
You know, I'm not really into breakfast foods.
Really?
Your purse is shaped like a waffle.
- Is it?
- Please join us.
The Gergiches don't take no for an answer.
- Mm-mm.
- Ugh, okay.
Come on in.
Girls, we've got company.
So, you want to get out of here?
Work just started, Ms. Meagle.
Yeah, but our work is just beginning.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, Donna, who's the new boy toy?
I'm Taylor, the new intern.
This is the new intern?
Are you kidding me?
Yeah, he went to high school with my sister, Natalie.
He was a big deal on the football team.
Oh, meathead jock type, huh?
Actually, I quit football senior year so I could help my pastor run a homeless shelter.
Oh.
Pfftt!
This guy loves the homeless so much, he should marry them, right?
Anybody would be lucky to marry him.
Hey, Taylor, do you want to marry me and April?
Wish I could, man, but I'm not a "marriage" dude.
I've got a lot of love to give, and it just seems unfair to put boundaries on it.
He gets it.
You so get it.
Oh, hey.
Hi.
Should I keep walking towards you?
Yeah, I could stop, and you could walk.
Or you know what, we could meet in the middle.
Great plan.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Welp.
- Okay.
Ron, ask me if I'm sad.
No.
Ron, I'm the new Jerry.
Well, is whining going to do anything about it?
You don't want to be a whipping boy.
Stand up for yourself.
You don't understand, Ron.
I already was Jerry.
I was a skinny Indian kid in South Carolina, and it sucked.
It took me 12 years, but I reinvented myself.
I'm a business owner.
I wear dope suits.
I have fur underwear.
It was all for nothing.
I'm back to being a Jerry.
All right.
I gotta buy some sweat pants and a Nicholas Sparks novel.
Might as well lean into it.
Tom can take care of himself.
He's a grown man.
Well, half-grown.
He does have a business where he rents out his clothes to 12-year-olds.
Eggs, bacon, and toast eggs, bacon, and toast why don't you start your day the Gergich way with eggs, bacon, and-- Oh, me?
t-toast eggs, bacon, and toast eggs, bacon, and toast why don't you start your day the Gergich way with eggs, bacon, and-- Toast Very good.
We sing that every morning.
But it's an extra treat because you're here to sing it with us.
Thanks, guys.
Jerry, I wanted your last day at work to be special, and I feel like I let you down.
No!
So I made you this scrapbook with nearly 4 amazing pages jam-packed with memories of your time in the government.
Oh, my go-- well, look.
Oh, honey.
You look great in every one of these.
You are still the most handsome man in the world to me.
Ugh.
Mom, come on.
Yeah, jeez, mom.
We're eating.
You know, it doesn't make any sense.
Leslie, that is really sweet of you, but you don't have to worry about me.
I'm great.
Here.
I want to show you something.
Okay.
No!
You also dropped that, clumsy.
Where am I?
I know I didn't achieve all my work goals, but, Leslie, I don't care because for me, the best part about working in the Parks department was that I got to be home every night with my family at 5:00.
And to me, that's what mattered most.
Little Sebastian Oh, wow.
Jerry.
Thank you for sharing this with me.
I-- You have a wonderful life.
Mmhmm.
Aw.
Group hug.
Uhoh, here they are.
The hug machine is here.
The hug machine-- it's firing on all cylinders.
Okay, I think we should be adults and talk about this.
I would love to.
I was nervous after yesterday because I was thinking what does this mean for us?
Not as parents, but as Chris and Ann?
I don't think on-again, off-again is a great parental model.
Well, I completely agree.
But if there is a hypothetical chance that we could provide a home with two parents who are hypothetically together, then that could be even better hypothetically.
Of course.
We should discuss and consider all the possibilities.
The most important thing for me and I think for you is that we have a child.
And I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that.
Do you want to make out?
I really do.
Hey.
What are you doing here, Jerry?
I thought you were fired.
I wasn't fired.
I retired.
That's what they all say.
I asked Jerry to come in.
That new intern wasn't working out, so I got rid of him.
Once again, I object in the strongest possible terms.
Once again, noted.
I have also asked Jerry to come in a couple hours a week until we find a permanent replacement.
Ugh, just when we were rid of him?
Yeah, I don't know, Ron.
Are you hearing me, son?
Jerry will come in once a week, and everyone will get to watch him eat and talk to him about anything he might do or say or fart.
- Welcome back, Jerry.
- Thank you.
Oh, it feels good just to be ba-- Classic new guy.
I'm sorry that I spent your day off with Jerry - instead of relaxing with you.
- It's all right.
And after you fell asleep making Jerry's scrapbook, I went back to season one of Fringe to check for plot holes.
As I suspected--airtight.
I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.
I love my job.
But in the blink of an eye, I'm gonna be retiring, you know, and flying off on Marine One with you and a Secret Service detail.
Achievements are great, but I want more than that.
I want what Jerry has.
I mean, we're always gonna work, but I think we need to fill this scrapbook too.
Maybe we should take a real day off and talk about starting our family.
Yeah.
That sounds perfect.
Hey, while you were over at Jerry's, did you happen to get any information about his history with Gayle?
Like, was she a Russian spy and the KGB forced her to marry Jerry as a cover?
You know, it's a mystery, Ben.
Let it go.
Yeah, I can't.
It keeps me awake at night.
Hey, maybe Gayle has one of those Oliver Sacks brain disorder thingies?
Like, does she think Jerry is a friendly hat?
I think you solved it.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Hey!
What the hell is this?
I'm guessing it's my latest budget cut proposal based on your rage sweat.
First of all, I am rage glowing.
Second, you wanna cut funding for the Pawnee Palms Public Putt-Putt?
What did the P.P.P.P.P. ever do to you?
Ron is very anti-government, and he has that philosophy, but there are just certain things that you don't cut.
Schools, police, mini-golf, merry-go-rounds, parades, gazebo repair, roads and bridges, whatever.
Pretty gardens, hummingbird feeders.
I believe in cutting useless government projects.
I also believe in cutting useful projects, future projects, and past projects.
The Hoover Dam is a travesty.
You also believe in making furniture.
Why don't you go solder a chair instead?
Do you expect me to make a chair out of transistor chips and small wires?
Look, the defunding of the mini-golf course is on the agenda for the city council meeting tomorrow.
I'm sure you'll argue against it with your trademark vigor.
Oh, I will argue, and I'm gonna win.
That putt-putt is gonna be around forever, and when I am done with it, it'll attract more visitors than the Hoover Dam.
And it'll produce double the amount of electricity.
- How?
- I'll figure it out.
It already has windmills.
Who cares?
Councilmen, I have something to discuss with you, but before I do, can I just point out how handsome the both of you look today?
- Yeah, I know.
- I feel very ill.
Okay, well, tomorrow we are voting on funding for the mini-golf course, and personally, I think it is great for families, it's a great job creator, and it's extremely cute.
I'm wondering which way you two are leaning.
Well, the last time I was there, I saw kids of all races getting along and playing.
It was terrible.
So I'm voting to get rid of it.
At least you have a good reason.
Well, Howser is with me.
Milton is with Dexhart.
Jeremy, you're the swing vote.
- What do you think?
- Hmm.
Well, on the one hand, I love cutting government programs.
On the other hand, mini-golf rules.
And on the third hand, I hate both you and Ron Swanson.
So this one could go either way.
I'm kind of a badass wild card.
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
More like who am I doing?
No one.
I'm free.
What's up?
Can I get two beers and an ice water for my friend here, designated driver?
I am?
You drove here.
Nah, it's too late, bro.
I already ordered the water.
I don't know what you want me to do.
Andy and I just closed a big donation to the Redwood Music Program, a charity he discovered, so I suggested we all go out for a celebratory drink.
And somehow I just ended up becoming the designated driver.
And paying for everyone.
And I didn't get to choose the bar.
I should be more assertive.
Aw, the band is moving me tonight.
It's really good.
Really?
They sound kinda crappy to me.
Kinda sounds like one of your songs, babe.
Well, you know what, Mouse Rat has a lot of influence on some of the local high school bands, mostly 'cause Chang buys 'em beer and whatnot.
Wait, Andy, this is a Mouse Rat song.
Spread your wings and fly, yeah That's my band.
I didn't recognize us without me because I'm the only one that matters.
Thank you, everyone.
We are Rat Mouse.
Rat Mouse?
Rat bastards.
They're playing without me?
That's a song I wrote!
Hey, baby, can I borrow your car for a month?
I already lent you my car.
Do you not know where my car is?
Ugh, I'm so sick of the third degree.
It's like dating a cop.
I'm gassy.
Let's make out.
- What?
- Yeah.
Move aside!
Dating Mona-Lisa is awesome.
Except that I live in constant fear for my life.
So I guess it's time to do the mature thing and have someone else dump her for me.
Uh, Perkins, sit down.
I just heard that you and Traeger might be getting back together.
Yeah, it's funny, right?
I mean, we're already planning on having a baby together.
We're not quite a couple but-- Yeah.
Cool.
Congrats.
Listen, I need your help.
My girlfriend is crazy.
You say that about every girl you date.
You said that about me.
Calm down, Ann.
You're proving my point.
Seriously, Mona-Lisa is legit insane.
She once jumped out of a moving car to buy a Nicki Minaj poster.
Can you break up with her for me?
I'm not gonna dump a girl for you.
I'll give you that chenille blanket of mine - you love so much.
- Deal.
Ugh, but that's my favorite blankie.
- Won't you do it for free?
- Nope.
Fine.
Yeah, dead ringer for Courtney Thorne-Smith.
She works at the gas station.
Okay, I need to have Jamm fall in love with this place, so I'm rolling out the red carpet.
I need you to stay upbeat.
Keep things light.
Absolutely.
I can be a sort of Conversational lubricant.
Yeah, there's probably a less gross way to say it, but sure.
I love being a caddy.
It's so much more than just carrying clubs.
It's about offering positive reinforcement.
I consider myself a caddy to everyone in my life.
- Yeah, good one!
- Nice shot!
Great sweeping.
Way to be, duck.
Councilman, nice putter.
Oh, thank you very much.
Some fat Hawaiian guy left it in my waiting room.
When he came back, I was all like, "Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, no, I haven't seen it.
I don't know".
Classic.
What a great and funny story.
Okay, before we start, anybody want a hot dog?
Hot dogs?
You know I have irritable bowel syndrome, you racist.
Yikes, okay.
How about a snow cone on me?
Hello, Councilman.
Chris, Leslie, snow cone lady.
I see you're about to play a round of publicly subsidized mini-golf.
Mind if I join you?
Well, hello, Burly, Chang.
Hey, man, what's up?
I was just over at the bar, enjoying a wonderful night with my co-workers who all talked about how awesome I was, and I look up, and what do I see?
A band.
But you're missing something like, uh, I don't know, your lead singer/songwriter/ T-shirt designer/nacho chef.
What's up?
First of all, your nachos are terrible.
No one's had the guts to tell you.
Why don't you melt the cheese?
We tried to tell you about the show, man.
I called your cell, like, 20 times.
Well, I dropped my cell phone in a bowl of cereal last week, you idiot.
You bothered to call me, you'd have known that.
Maybe you should change your name to Burly and The Backstabbers.
That's a pretty good name, actually.
Yeah, he's really good at coming up with names.
Get me a Budweiser Black Crown.
You guys got Black Crown here?
If not, you should.
Ron, are you gonna be joining us?
I won't be playing.
I'm simply here to remind Councilman Jamm that this ridiculous play palace costs the taxpayers thousands of dollars a year.
And what a bargain.
I mean, kids love it, adults love it, Jamm loves it.
Everybody loves it.
It's like the Toy Story 3 of places.
Yeah, she's right, Swanson.
I do love it.
You should relax a little.
Have a snow cone.
Leslie's buying all night.
You don't say.
She's buying you snow cones, and tomorrow you're voting on an issue that she cares about.
Hey, guys, what, are we gonna stand around all day and listen to Ron spout off unrelated facts about blah, blah, blah, or are we gonna play?
Game on.
Hey, everybody, great news.
They gave us free mylar balloons.
I got dibs on the dinosaur.
And the pirate and the dolphin.
I want all of 'em.
- You got 'em.
- Sweet.
The Councilman is away Good luck to you both.
Luck has nothing to do with it, Chris.
Yeah, I could be a pro!
Wow, you are on fire, Jeremy.
- Having fun?
- Mmhmm.
I think this proves that this is a wonderful place that brings joy to people's lives and brings a community together.
It's also a place that costs the taxpayer $9,000 in annual subsidies.
You guys sound like school.
I have two important pieces of caddy information.
Councilman Jamm leads by eight strokes, and you are both about to set a course record.
For friendship.
On to the next hole.
You are pandering to get a vote.
And worse, you're deliberately losing.
I am not deliberately losing.
I'm having a very off night.
Losing on purpose is a form of lying.
You're only as good as your word.
You want a word, Ron?
I have a word for you.
I will do anything I can to get Jamm's vote so that he will keep this course open, and it will be good for the community-- stop!
I know it's more than one word.
Shut up.
Remember Hi, Mona-Lisa?
Hi.
I'm Ann Perkins.
- I used to date Tom.
- Oh, okay.
We can do this, but I will bite you.
Is that a screwdrive-- no, I do not want to fight.
- No.
- Okay.
I just wanna talk to you woman-to-woman because I know Tom pretty well.
Do you know his ATM pin?
'Cause I cannot crack that little bitch's code.
I don't.
You know what used to drive me nuts?
He is a total control freak.
I mean, you have to put a coaster down on every surface, and the worst part is, they're all made out of pictures from Diddy's Instagram.
Diddy's on Instagram?
How did I not know that Diddy was on Instagram, you jagweeds?
- Who are you yelling at?
- The jagweeds.
Why are you still in front of me?
- Everything that used to - I'm done with that band.
I mean, I'm an adult now, you know?
I work two part-time jobs.
Hello.
I don't need the stress of playing guitar with my friends every few weeks.
Yeah, plus look how bad they are without you.
Burly's terrible.
He actually has a really beautiful voice for a backup singer.
Right, that's what I meant.
I love Andy, but to be perfectly honest, Mouse Rat's music is not my thing.
I really only listen to, like, German Death Reggae and Halloween sound effects records from the 1950s.
And Bette Midler.
Obviously.
You know what, I'm retiring from music.
- Andy.
Andy.
- Done.
But not without first a monster farewell performance solo on this stage tonight, everybody.
I'ma show these idiots what a big mistake they made.
I need piece of paper, I need a pen, I need four more beers, I need a computer fan, I need a lightning bolt of inspiration.
It's song writing time.
What do you need a computer fan for?
Sometimes when you use a computer, it gets hot, and the fan cools it down.
You know, I think it's great that you're cool with Tom's financial situation.
What are you talking about?
Tommy owns his own business.
Yeah, but he had to borrow a lot of money, and when you're not around, Tom drinks tap water.
What?
Excuse me.
You're broke?
Uh, yeah, super broke.
Are you upset about that?
Mm, yeah, 'cause I don't eff with poorsies.
But thanks to a warning from my new best friend, I don't have to, okay?
We're done, you're awesome, and I don't even usually like Puerto Rican chicks.
I'm not--I mean, it shouldn't matter, but I'm-- You're breaking up with me?
- Oh, man, that sucks.
- That's right.
It's over.
Let's go dance.
Help.
Ugh, I cannot catch a break.
You better find your stroke, Knope.
Guys, I'm gonna let Julie go home.
It's getting late, and Jeremy's eaten all the syrup.
Thank you.
It's been an honor working alongside you.
- Thanks.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up.
Snow cones are half the fun.
Yeah, Julie, could you stay, please?
I have calculus homework.
I-- Oh, well, math is worthless in real life.
I mean, there's an app for calculating tips.
That's all you need.
Math is very important, especially for young women.
Stay in school.
I've made my point.
Leslie has made hers.
Which way are you voting, Councilman?
Uh, well, I'm kind of still on the fence about this budget thing, but I do love watching you guys squabble over me.
You sure make a guy feel like a real lady.
Weird.
All right, how about this?
You two play each other.
Nine holes.
Winner gets my vote.
I'm game.
Ron?
An athletic competition where both parties are competing their hardest is certainly more honorable than whatever this charade is.
Sudden death playoff on the very course that hangs in the balance.
I could literally faint if I didn't have impeccable blood pressure.
Oh, hey, everybody.
My name is Andy Dwyer.
You probably know me as the artist formerly known as the lead singer of Mouse Rat.
Well, after tonight, you'll only know me as the former artist formerly known as the lead singer of Mouse Rat.
I'm retiring from music.
This is my swan song.
Once I was a golden swan swan of a man now that swan's name was Andy and he started a rock and roll band he made incredible nachos that everybody claimed they loved and then the band mates dicked him over with a massive rock and roll shove this is my swan song watch me fly - Tom.
- What happened to you?
Mona-Lisa happened to me.
She covered me in glitter and Anna Nicole body spray.
Why do they still even make that?
They don't--she's had the same bottle for years.
She just mixes in water and baby oil.
Now it's your turn to help me, okay?
You need to break things off with me and Mona-Lisa.
Uh, Ann, this might be a battle you need to fight yourself.
I try not to get involved in other people's personal relationships.
Aah!
Don't hurt me.
Get me out of this friendship!
I'm gonna find a place where I can be the beautiful duckling I always was inside whoa whoa whoa Why is there a gorilla guarding this gingerbread house?
Because mini-golf is awesome.
It's cute, and it's fun, and it needs to be saved.
Less talk.
More competing for my vote.
Wow.
This is it.
Ron leads by one.
If he hits the ball into the dragon's mouth, he gets Jamm's vote.
Uh, bean sprouts.
Tofu.
Ralph Nader.
Ayn Rand is a terrible writer.
Don't mess up, don't mess up, don't mess up.
- Damn it!
- Hole- in-one!
Excellent win, Ron.
Even better loss, Leslie.
Ultimately, we learn the most about ourselves through the losses.
Swanson, I hate you.
Nothing will change that.
But I respect the hell out of your short game.
You got my vote, hombre.
Hey, you got a hole-in-one on 18, so I'm supposed to give you this.
No, he gets the dragon too?
A fine trophy.
I think I'll keep it in the office.
No, you won't.
- Here, kid, want this, huh?
- Yeah.
Take it and run.
Run!
Tom, she's coming!
Tom!
Okay, desperation time.
Follow my lead.
What lead?
What do you mean?
What are you-- oh.
What the mother-effing, c-ing ess-ing, effing k-ing eff is going on right now?
Sorry, Mona-Lisa.
We can't keep our hands off each other.
That is accurate.
Oh, it's all finally very clear.
All the times that you were like, "Oh, no, Tom's no good for you".
And all the times you tried to break it off with me - I finally get it.
- Mmhmm.
You guys want a threesome.
What?
No.
We do not wanna have a threesome with you.
Well, let's not rush to judgment.
- I mean, I say we hear her out.
- Gross.
Tom, good luck.
You still owe me a blanket.
She's got a screw loose, am I right?
Actually she's not the one in my life I would call crazy.
Look, I still don't think we should date.
Oh, me neither.
I've been single for an hour now, and it's the tits!
I'd still like to hook up though.
Yo, do you wanna have a threesome with us?
Yeah, okay.
- Cool.
- Sweet.
- All right.
- All right.
Yo, what up?
My name is Mona-Lisa.
Well, hello, fellow employees.
Co-workers, I bid you adieu.
Whoa, fancy Andy.
Oh, me?
No.
This is just how I dress now.
Funny goofball music Andy is gone.
You're left with the professional remains.
I'm an adult now.
I'm gonna focus on business, which is good.
Give me more time to play video games.
Babe, you love that band that I also love so much.
They're important to you.
Come on, call Burly and ask him to let you back in.
Why, so they can steal my swan song?
Ha, joke's on them.
I forgot it.
No, business is my life now.
- Okay, what's in there?
- I don't know.
I-it's locked.
- Yeah, that's my briefcase.
- Is it?
Good gravy.
Oh, hello, Ron.
I believe you know this gorilla.
It used to bring joy to hundreds of Pawnee families, but then you got rid of its habitat, so it died.
Your office shall serve as its monkey tomb.
- How much did you pay for this?
- Irrelevant.
I would pay any amount of money to properly shame you.
Leslie, you should know by now that I live my life according to a certain set of principles, and I do not deviate from them.
Right, I mean, God forbid you're flexible in any way.
You should just stick to your stupid, rigid, anti-government principles.
But you know what?
Those principles stink.
They're not the right principles.
You may think so.
I do not.
Thank you for my new silver-backed friend.
I like him very much.
I will call him "$9,000 of taxpayer money the gorilla".
That is a terrible-- his name is Mr. Fuzzyface!
Hey.
How did your wild dirtbag fantasy night work out?
Well, Mona-Lisa and the random girl she grabbed after you left got into a fistfight in the parking lot.
Eventually, Mona-Lisa threw a cinderblock through the girl's windshield.
She dives in, steals her purse, doesn't go for the money, steals all her birth control pills, and says, "Bitch, you're gonna get pregnant".
She then pretends those are ecstasy and sells it to a bunch of college kids that are drinking GoldschlÃ¤ger at a gas station.
You have to break up with her.
I tried.
Again.
It did not go well.
Did she assault you?
- No, this was a sexual injury.
- Okay, gross.
Anyway, here's your chenille blanket.
You earned it.
Thanks for your help.
Tom, thank you.
Eh, be nice to Chenille O'Neal.
I will.
It needs to be brushed regularly.
Never use a lint roller.
- I'm dead serious.
- Okay.
And keep it out of direct sunlight.
If I see this at one picnic, I swear-- Okay, you know what, I don't even want it anymore.
Yes!
Thank you!
What's up, yellow head?
Jamm, are you here to rub it in my face that I lost your vote last night?
Well, I was, but it doesn't have to go down that way.
You shook Ron's hand and told him that you were gonna vote to close the putt-putt.
My word is garbage.
Everyone knows that.
Let's talk deal.
What can you offer me to change my mind?
Wow, Jamm, even for you, this is pretty sleazy.
Hey, don't act so shocked.
A few months ago, you traded me your office for that stupid swimming pool bill.
Last night you bring in a teenage girl to pump me full of snow cones.
This is simply how people like us operate.
I have six things to say to you.
One: You drive me nuts with your rigid code of honor.
Two: Congratulations, putt-putt has been defunded.
And only because Jamm was going to double-cross you, and I made him stick to his word.
Three: I am furious that putt-putt has been defunded.
Four: I am sorry that I said the gorilla's blood was on your hands.
'Twas Leslie killed the beast.
Five: Putt-putt is for children, and they are the future, and I have already written a ballot measure that will save it, and it will pass.
And six: Your rigid code of honor, which drives me nuts, makes you a wonderful human being, and I am proud to call you my friend, and don't ever change.
- You want a drink?
- Very much.
Burly, I just want to say I'm sorry that I haven't been to rehearsal and that I won't let you sing or write songs or walk out onstage in front of me.
Man, I love playing with you guys.
And I want back in if you'll let me.
Well, we never wanted to kick you out.
It's just, you didn't show up for practice, - and we like to play.
- Right.
If you wanna come back in, you can.
I'm more of a backup singer anyways.
You can say that again.
No, no, no.
Hey, you got a great voice.
Yeah, Ben!
God, don't say that.
- Welcome back, buddy.
- Yes.
All right!
Hey, I'll even try melting the cheese on the nachos.
All right.
It won't work.
You're gonna look like such an idiot.
I have been in the city council for almost a year, and I'm proud of what I've done.
But every once in a while, I end up in a situation that makes my stomach queasy.
You're in politics.
What did you expect?
Frankly, I hoped it would be like dealing with you.
People with strong opinions hashing it out respectfully.
And then you either realize that I'm right or you get hungry and go home and I win.
There are a lot of Jeremy Jamms along the path you're walking.
I suppose you just need to figure out whether it's a path you truly wanna walk.
Yeah.
I'm taking that gorilla with me and putting it back in the putt-putt - when it reopens.
- Sorry, no.
That gorilla was a gift from a very determined co-worker whom I respect.
And there's a certain code of honor that accompanies gift-giving.
God, you're the worst.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Mouse Rat's Reunion Show, featuring me, Andy Dwyer, and for the first time, Andrew "Burly" Burlinson on lead vocals.
That's right, two lead vocalists.
Name one other band that's done that.
The Beatles.
Three, four!
Oh I know we had bad times but we had good times too
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Okay, everyone.
Look in your folders.
You will find information about founder's week.
And before we start brainstorming, I just wanna thank Ron for lending us his cabin.
Lending?
Makes it sound like I had a choice in the matter.
I never should've agreed to this or let you know that I have a cabin or gotten to know any of you.
That's the spirit.
Founder's week is a yearly celebration of all things Pawnee.
We've got a pie-eating contest, a giant petting zoo, and the granddaddy of them all, the founder's week parade.
I don't wanna over-hype it, but our parade makes the rose bowl parade look like a turds-on-wheels convention.
Let's do an exercise.
April, what makes Pawnee the best city in the world?
Easy: Most murders per capita.
The guillotine was invented here.
City Hall is run by the walrus mafia.
Donna, help me out.
What makes Pawnee so great?
Cost of living is cheap.
In about three years, I will have saved enough to pay off my condo in Seattle.
You have a condo in Seattle?
Yes, I like the rain and the fish markets.
Guys, we need to focus.
I want this to be the best founder's week ever, okay?
- No more distractions.
- I'm bored.
Let's go have sex in a tree.
He'll be back in eight minutes.
Why did you have to bring her here?
I don't really have any power in this relationship.
I'll think of ideas in the tree.
Anyone's welcome to join us in the tree!
Really?
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Good morning, colleagues, co-workers, friends.
Everyone feeling normal today?
Here's what happened.
I left my sweat shirt at Ron's cabin.
When I went back to get it, I found this in the trash: Positive pregnancy test.
Side note: I accidentally threw my sweat shirt away.
That's why I was digging through the trash.
Found that too.
Pretty cool.
So if my science is correct, one of the five women who were at the cabin-- Leslie, Donna, Ann, Mona-Lisa, or April-- is pregnant!
Can't be April.
She would've told me.
That leaves four suspects.
There's only one man for this job: Bert Macklin, FBI.
They said I was retired.
They said I was too dangerous for the Pawnee Police Department.
Turns out they were right and wrong.
Macklin, you son of a bitch.
Hello, fellow Pawneeans.
As you know, the founder's week festivities kick off tomorrow.
Um, one small announcement: Due to a tragic misunderstanding, the prettiest pig beauty pageant has been replaced by a pork rib barbecue competition.
Oh, no.
But on to less grisly news, thank you for participating in our special founder's week public forum led by councilwoman Leslie Knope.
Thanks to a lot of hard work and some very dedicated civil servants, this has been a banner year for our city.
Obesity and diabetes are down.
Test scores are up.
Pawnee raccoon attacks have decreased.
People can now suddenly feel safe in our parks, grocery stores, and hospitals.
I am very proud of what we've accomplished.
In fact, this forum is kind of my victory lap.
I am here today to ask you one question.
Are you better off now than you were a year ago?
Who'd like to start?
Uh-oh.
Kathryn Pinewood, Pawnee Restaurant Association.
This town is not better off.
This past year has been a disaster, and this government is hell-bent on stripping away our most basic personal freedoms.
Okay, counterpoint.
Ms. Pinewood, I've never stripped away anyone's freedoms.
I simply stopped a restaurant from serving an insane which only made our citizens healthier.
And frankly, I don't see any of those citizens standing up and complaining abo-- Okay.
Now, I see them.
Whoa!
Darren!
Slow down!
That sweat suit's not for sweatin' in, okay?
This is crushed velvet.
If you go at more than a brisk walk, it will fall apart.
This looks dope.
Let's pay for it.
Business is booming.
If it keeps up like this, I would leave the Parks Department and do Rent-A-Swag full-time, maybe even expand.
I could add a baby section over there, call it "Li'l Swaggers".
I could add some old people stuff, call it "Rent-A-Sag".
Ugh, no.
Old people are gross.
Oh.
Nice.
Hey, dingdong!
Can I go home?
My tum-tum feels gross, and also, I hate working.
I guess, but find someone to cover for you, okay?
'Cause we're really busy right now.
Also, a lawyer guy called you.
He sounded really sexy on the phone, and I was very into that.
Like, I was, like, very into that.
All right, let's set up some boundaries on what's cool for you to say to me, okay?
Okay.
I frenched my cousin one time.
That's gross.
I might still be in love with him.
- Please leave.
- All right, bye.
Tom Haverford, my name is Trevor Nelsson.
I represent a client who would like to make you an offer.
Babyface heard my demo?
I will accept a record deal.
No, you deeply misunderstand.
My client has taken an interest in Rent-A-Swag.
He'd like to know if you are looking to sell a controlling interest in the store.
Whoa, Diddy wants to buy Rent-A-Swag?
- Not what I said.
- This is a lot to process.
Will Diddy be coming to the meeting?
I'm not at liberty to tell you who my client is.
It would violate confidentiality.
- I understand.
- It's not Diddy.
Got it.
- Oh.
- Oh, helloAnn.
Oh, boy.
What do you want, Macklin?
Me?
Just observing.
A little something they taught us down at Quantico.
Well, I guess I'll get out of your hair.
Wait, there is just one more question.
- Congratulations.
- Is that a question?
It's an accusation, 'cause I know your secret.
- You're pregnant.
- What?
I'm not pregnant.
You're not?
Damn it.
Who is?
'Cause I found this at Ron Swanson's cabin.
- It's a pregnancy test.
- Oh, my God.
Someone we know is pregnant?
I'm trying to get pregnant.
That's not fair.
I mean, great, and happy for them, and congratulations, whatever, but ooh!
No!
Boo!
We have to find out who this is.
Whoa, I don't think so.
Bert Macklin works alone.
I will buy lunch.
You can have as many burgers as you want.
Welcome to the FBI.
Ms. Pinewood, Leslie's public health initiative has been a huge success.
Pawnee is no longer the fourth most obese city in America.
We're now ninth.
Together, as a town, we lost an amount of weight equal to 800 pregnant manatees.
A gym opened, and it stayed in business.
And people checking into the E.R. after ingesting a whole candy wrapper is down 40%.
But where will it end?
Now, you wanna rob our children of fun by attacking the Sweetums school lunch program, literally taking candy from babies.
Those school lunches are incredibly unhealthy.
You somehow convinced the school board that napkins are a vegetable.
They're made from plants.
Stop restricting our freedoms.
Yeah!
My name is Dewey from Sanitation.
Ever since you stripped us of our freedoms by making us hire women, we've had to turn one of our bathrooms into a woman's bathroom.
We only have one bathroom now.
I'm so sorry, Dewey.
That sounds like a horrible price to pay for something as trivial as gender equality.
So you agree.
Bjorn Lerpiss of the Pawnee Lerpiss family.
There was supposed to be a Paunch Burger in this lot next to my house.
And then, you stripped my freedom by putting a park there.
Now, if I wanna start my day off with a triple-decker pancake breakfast pizza, I gotta go to the one that's 10 minutes away, and that makes me 20 minutes late to work every day.
I work at home.
Have you ever considered not eating that for breakfast?
I'll never consider that.
This feels strangely personal.
Maybe it's because they're all standing up saying how much they hate me as a person.
How many people am I talking to, Donna?
One or 1 1/9?
Are you asking me if I'm pregnant?
Oh.
Interesting.
I don't remember saying anything about anyone being pregnant.
Are you sure it's not you?
I'm a grown woman with a good head on her shoulders.
Don't worry about me.
Whew.
This case just got interesting.
Well, not just.
It was pretty interesting to begin with.
This case just remained interesting.
Listen, my wife and I do not feel that we're better off than a year ago because a year ago, this town was not a horrifying sex den where people could put their body parts anywhere they want with impunity.
And then, you were elected.
And now, this town a horrifying sex den where people can put their body parts anywhere they want to with impunity.
Yeah.
If you are referring to my fight to teach comprehensive sex education, you need to at least acknowledge the fact that STDs are down 14% from last year.
And deviant behavior in Pawnee is up a billion percent!
No, it's-- no, it's-- This town is going to hell in a Gucci knock-off handbag, girl.
See?
See?
They agree.
Come on.
I am definitely better off than I was a year ago, and it's all thanks to Leslie Knope.
This woman single-handedly saved my business.
Thank you, Dennis.
There you go, perfect example.
No need for further questions on that one.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What is your business, sir?
Oh, I run a pornographic DVD emporium.
Well, it used to be a quaint, little movie rental place with a lot of community value.
- Oh, it's much better now.
- Yeah!
- Leslie is the best.
- No, no, Brandi.
- Gah, gah, gah, gah-- - Hello, everyone.
- I'm Brandi Maxxxx - Hi, Brandi.
Star of such films as the incredible Burt Wonderbone, A Good Guy to Lay Hard, and Argo.
I had a small part in Argo as well as the porn version Our Goo.
I've seen the first 90 seconds.
It's thrilling.
If it weren't for Leslie Knope, there would be far, far less pornography in this town.
No, what happened was there was a misunderstanding, and I accidentally got the government involved in an unseemly business, but I cleared that up, and everything's fine.
It's not like I'm some kind of sex-crazed maniac or something.
Leslie, are you pregnant?
Did you or did you not leave this positive pregnancy test in a dumpster in the woods?
Hey, everybody.
- No.
- Really?
Okay.
Well, I'll get out of your hair.
Sorry to interrupt.
Was that Brandi Maxxxx?
Investors, I have some very exciting news about Rent-A-Swag.
Someone-- I'm not saying Diddy, but I'm not not saying Diddy-- has offered to buy out Rent-A-Swag for a buttload of money.
How big a buttload, son?
We would all basically double our investments.
Are you kidding me?
Sell, baby.
Imagine the kind of treat-yourself day we could have with the profits.
I'm talking pedicures on pedicures on pedicures.
That is appealing.
If someone is interested in buying you out, it means you're doing something right.
I say you continue to grow, accumulate power, find this investor, and buy his business to teach him a lesson.
- April, what do you think?
- I thought about this a lot.
I actually think that you should get a "Hello Kitty" tattoo.
- No, with the store.
- Oh.
Uh, burn it for the insurance money.
Tom, listen to me, if there's one thing I've learned-- - God, nobody cares, Gary.
- Enough.
- Thank you.
- I miss you guys.
What a wonderful event.
Everyone is having fun.
This is great.
Chris, could you just please I'm sorry, I was just trying to cheer you up.
- Just hang in there.
- Thanks.
All right, if you'll excuse me, I found out this morning that I am playing a special role in this parade.
No spoilers.
Honey, I hate to state the obvious, but you chose a life in politics.
I mean, the more you actually accomplish, the more heat you're gonna draw.
- Yeah, I know.
- Let's go watch the parade.
You know you can't resist a parade.
That's true.
Parades and your butt: - My two vices.
- There you go.
Whoa, what are you doing?
My assistant has something she'd like to show you.
Partner.
Oh, my assistant has something she'd like to show you, partner.
It's a positive pregnancy test, Tom.
I found it outside of Ron's cabin after our brainstorming session.
Is there any possibility Mona-Lisa could be pregnant?
We always use protection but I'm pretty positive she pokes holes in them.
What brand pregnancy test is it?
It's called "Womb There It Is".
That's her brand.
I'm gonna be a dad?
I'm gonna have a baby with Jean-Ralphio's sister?
Oh, God.
What have I done?
Like, to humanity?
This is the perfect thing to take my mind off of yesterday.
I am going to pretend that this is my victory parade and the town is celebrating my hard work and dedication.
- There you go.
- Leslie, Leslie.
I'm so sorry.
I need to talk to you.
What are-- what?
I'm the Nipple King.
Kernston's Rubber Nipple Company elects a nipple king and a nipple queen every year to ride on the float.
- Congratulations, Chris.
- Thank you.
- It's such an amazing honor.
- It's wonderful.
But I do need to talk to you about a float that is in this parade, because I'm not sure that you're going to be-- - No fun for you!
- Uh-oh.
No fun for you!
- Is that me?
- Maybe it's not you.
- Maybe it's Kate Upton.
- Oh, thank you.
No, it's me, and damn them.
No fun for you!
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, stop, please!
Stop!
Excuse me, Pawnee.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to stop your parade or anything, but I just have to say something here, okay?
I don't think this is very fair!
Babe--babe, stop wagging your finger.
Certain people are lashing out at me because of things that I did this year.
But I am not trying to stop you from having fun.
I am an extremely fun person.
This float represents a group of over 300 business owners, individuals, and community leaders who are protesting unfair government regulation.
We are the committee to recall Leslie Knope.
Let's kick her out of office.
Recall Knope!
Recall Knope!
Recall Knope!
- Recall Knope!
- Legalize weed!
Recall Knope!
Recall Knope!
So, I need to ask you something and I kinda wish Jean-Ralphio wasn't here.
Please tell me that you're dumping my sister, because I will laugh-- I will laugh so much.
Actually, it may be the opposite.
- Is this yours?
- No, no.
Yeah.
It's mine.
- I'm pregnant.
- Lemony snicket.
Oh, my God, are you serious?
I'm gonna be an uncle?
Is that a real thing?
Is that gonna happen?
No, no, that's too much-- too much responsibility for me.
I gotta--I gotta find another way out of this.
Well, I wish you told me.
I mean, obviously, we need to talk about our future.
Maybe I could sell the business, and we could use the profits to put a down payment on a house or something, or-- - Psych!
- What?
Ah, ha, ha.
Look at your stupid face.
- You had a dumdum face.
- That was hilarious.
Oh, that was hilarious That's hilarious So you're not pregnant?
This isn't yours?
, no.
Do you know how many different pills I take, birth control or otherwise?
There is no way that I could be pregnant with a human baby.
Thank God.
Yes!
Tommy has his life back!
Let's go!
What the hell is wrong with you, man?
That's my sister.
Nah!
I'm just kidding, man.
She's the worst.
You dodged a bullet, baby.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Bad, bad, bad, bad.
Well, Macklin, it's not Mona-Lisa.
It's not me, it's not Donna, it's not Leslie.
There was only one other woman at that cabin.
April?
No, she would've told me.
Besides, the math doesn't add up because we only have sex every single day.
And since she's the only one that we haven't talked to, it has to be hers.
Oh, my God.
I don't like seeing you like this.
I've never felt this way before.
Maybe I should just quit.
Maybe we should both quit, and we should move to the Bahamas, live on a beach, catch fish with homemade spears.
Yeah, you'd last about 30 seconds with that work.
When we went to Hawaii, you woke me up at 3:00 A.M. to watch Meet the Press.
Well, it was Elizabeth Warren.
Like, I'm not going to watch that live?
Look, you can hate your job sometimes.
It's allowed.
But let me ask you this: Do you think this town is better off - than it was a year ago?
- Yes.
Do you stand behind everything you've done?
- Yes.
- Then screw 'em.
But even if I wanted to fight this recall, how would I do it?
Thank you all for coming.
As most of you probably know, there is a large committee that has announced plans to recall me from office.
My response to them is this: Bring it on.
Step up.
Step Up 2: The Streets.
I'm sorry, my adrenaline is pumping, so all I can think of is dance movie titles.
Stomp the Yard.
There's one.
Look, I work very hard for this town, as hard as I can, and all that matters to me is whether or not everyone here thinks that they are better off now than they were a year ago.
I think you are.
If you disagree with me, then go ahead and recall me.
Go crazy.
You Got Served.
Silver Linings Playbook, kind of.
The committee says they plan to push for a recall vote within two months.
- Do you have a comment on that?
- Nope.
Again, all I really care about is are you better off?
I think I'm better off.
I haven't had a date in a while, but I'm learning a lot about me.
Well, I wasn't asking you specifically, but I'm happy to hear that, Shauna.
So, in conclusion, recall, shmecall.
No, I can't end my big press conference by saying "Recall, shmecall".
That's ridiculous.
Ben, can you help me out here?
That concludes councilwoman Knope's press conference.
And if you have any further questions hold on to them, because she has a lot of work to do.
Thanks, honey.
Honey.
That's another dance movie with Jessica alba.
Alright, people.
The Pawnee river's not gonna clean itself.
Volunteer weekend task force, mobilize.
Oh, Leslie, this goes without saying, but if you need any speeches or testimonials or just general enthusiasm for your recall fight, I'm your man.
- Thank you, Chris.
- You're welcome.
I'll see you at the river.
Oh, oh, oh!
Last one to pick up has still accomplished a great deal.
Hey, maybe after, you wanna come meet me and Chris for a drink?
Sure.
Hey, how's it going with you guys?
We're great, actually, and we're having a good time.
- Sex is ridiculous.
- Mm-hmm.
Hopefully, that ridiculous sex will lead to a baby.
I'm so happy for you.
Just remember to use protection.
Wait, no, don't.
That would defeat the purpose.
Okay, no.
Do your thing.
Yeah!
- My wife is pregnant!
- Okay, put me down.
Hey, you can't keep it from me.
I found the pregnancy test, honey.
Honey, I'm not pregnant, okay?
And if I were, you shouldn't lift me up.
Wait, are you sure you're not?
Yeah.
We've talked about this.
Remember?
I wanna wait until we're 50 and then adopt a set of creepy adult twins from Romania.
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
Actually, there is something I need to tell you.
You're pregnant.
- No.
- No!
We just ruled that out.
- Ah, dang it.
- Okay, a while ago, I applied to veterinary school in Bloomington, and I just found out that I got in.
You did?
That's amazing!
Wait, why did you wait to tell me?
Because I don't even know if I wanna go, okay?
I mean, yes, it's been my dream to work with animals since I was a kid and everything.
But it would mean I would be spending a lot of time apart from you, and Oh, we could get through that.
I mean, look.
It would suck for a while, and I would miss you while you're gone.
But as I've known about you for the past 20 seconds, this is your dream.
I'm really glad I married you.
Yeah, we made a good call on that one.
So I just wanted to let you know I will not be selling Rent-A-Swag.
And you can go tell your client he now has 100 problems?
- Is it Jay-Z?
- No.
But since you're not taking the deal, I should inform you that my client will be moving on to plan  Opening his own store directly across the street from yours.
Across the street?
What kind of store is it gonna be?
He's calling it "Tommy's Closet".
It's a high-end secondhand clothing store where parents can rent clothes for their teens, tweens, and pres, as well as babies, toddlers, grown-ups, and olds.
But that's my idea and my name.
So I guess only Domino's is allowed to sell pizza now?
It's called capitalism, Mr. Haverford, and you are about to get a free lesson.
Only this free lesson is going to cost you.
So it's not free?
You're right.
That was confusing.
This lesson will cost you.
Good day.
This sucks, but I have to admit: It's a pretty baller move.
You sure this isn't Diddy?
- It is Diddy.
- I knew it!
It's not Diddy.
Are you sure everything will be all right if April goes to vet school?
There are no sure things in life, son, but you two seem pretty solid to me.
- Change is good, I guess.
- Not to me.
Leslie's going around asking everybody if they're better off than they were a year ago.
All I care about is that I'm the same.
If I'm the same as I was a year ago, I'm happy.
Wait, I forgot.
- Who the hell is pregnant?
- What?
I found a pregnancy test at your cabin, and I checked with all the girls over there.
It wasn't any of them.
Hello, darling.
What a surprise.
Hey.
Can we talk?
Maybe in private?
