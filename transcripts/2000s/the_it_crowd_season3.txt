{START OF EPISODE 1}
1 I could have brought it in tomorrow, you know.
You didn't have to follow me home.
Jen, I know what it's like, lending money.
You do not want it hanging over you.
It's better I just get it back now before it becomes this big thing between us.
You gave it to me two hours ago and you literally haven't left my side since!
I am never going to borrow money off you again.
You're a nightmare.
- There, Â£5.
God!
- Thanking you.
- Hi, Jen.
- Oh, Gary, hi.
How's it going?
- Good.
I've finished that first wall.
- Great.
That was quick.
Gary's doing a bit of work around the house.
Hello.
- Have we met?
- Er no, I don't think so.
- You just look - Oh - I'd better crack on.
- OK.
- Bye, Roy.
- He's - Yeah, all right.
Time to go.
- I don't think - Get out.
- No, wait!
Wait.
It can wait till tomorrow.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Nice glasses, mate!
You look a right old muppet in them!
Why didn't you tell me this last night?
You wouldn't let me.
Builders From Hell?
!
I'm pretty sure it was one of those programmes.
- Gary's a builder from hell?
- I think so.
- Oh, so you're not sure?
- Jen, I'm 99% sure.
Well what did he do?
The work was fine, there was nothing wrong with the work, but then they caught him - He pissed in the sink.
- Oh!
Oh!
Yeah - Which sink?
- All the sinks.
Oh!
Yeah, he basically went on a pee parade around the house.
- Oh, God, I have to fire him.
- I think you should, yeah.
I'm 95% sure it was him.
You you said you were 99% sure.
I'm 97% sure it was him.
I- I have to get home.
I have to get home.
Hey, man.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Wait.
Was it those bullies again?
Yeah.
Oh.
What do they do exactly?
They make hurtful comments, Roy.
You have to learn how to stand up for yourself, man.
OK, let's try something.
Let's do some role play, OK?
Do you think that would be a good idea?
It certainly helped me learn how to buy sandwiches.
OK.
Let's go for it, OK?
So, I'll be those bullies on the bench.
- What, all of them?
- No, just one of them.
- Which one?
- I don't know them, Moss.
I'm a bully on the bench, and you're going to walk past me.
But this time, after I make a "hurtful comment", come back at me with something, OK?
Get all up in my shit.
All right?
OK.
Oh, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
What do they usually say?
- They mention my glasses.
- OK, let's start with that.
Them glasses is shit, innit?
It's too real, Roy!
It's too real!
- I won't do the voice.
- Thank you.
OK.
OK.
- Nice glasses.
- Oh, yeah, er maybe the reason I have to wear glasses is because I suffer from short-sightedness and I can't I won't I can't put contact lenses in cos I'm frightened of touching my eyes.
I can't There's no way that th-these glasses I can't And there's no - Yeah.
- Yeah.
Stupid hair!
Mr Reynholm, you seem to lack a basic understanding of exactly how much trouble this company's in!
We have a financial crisis here, and if you don't mind me saying, your attitude seems to me incredibly cavalier.
What?
I can't hear you.
Can't you see we're having an iPod party?
- Mr Reynholm, please!
- What?
Sorry girls, you'd better go.
Girls, ship it!
Best accounting team I've ever had.
What's your problem?
This is the problem.
The iPod parties are the problem.
The gold flakes in the drinking water are the problem.
The obscene amount you spend on erotic art.
Easy there!
That's an original.
Do you know how much trouble we're in?
Do you know what the shareholders are going to do with us?
I'm sorry, but you were getting hysterical.
No, I wasn't!
- You seemed hysterical.
- No!
Anyway, don't worry about the shareholders.
I can handle them.
But you've missed every meeting with them for the last seven weeks.
Where were you last time?
You're going to hate me for this, but I fancied the day off, so I took some of the pension money out of the bank and I lost it on a horse.
Yes!
Gambling with our employees' pensions?
Gambling?
No.
I was riding the horse-- it fell out of my pocket.
Oh, my God!
I'm not hysterical!
Hi, Gary.
Oh, hello.
I thought I'd work from home today.
Sorry, bit out of breath.
Hope you don't mind.
No.
Not at all.
Oh!
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you said you had a problem with your laptop.
You don't mind if I fiddle about while we speak?
- Well, actually, I - Yeah, no, good.
I can't seem to get it open.
You want me to open it?
!
That's why you called me all the way up here, to open your laptop?
!
I would be beholden to you.
No problem.
- Given the delicate nature of our - Money, money, money!
That's the problem with you people - it's always about money.
Roy, give me Â£20.
- What?
- Give me Â£20.
I'll pay you back.
Yeah, er You know what I think of money?
- Oh!
- That's what I think of money.
Ah, you've opened it.
Thanks, Roy.
You're welcome.
You do know Japan have expressed concern?
What, the whole country?
No, not the whole Mr Yamamoto.
- He's important, isn't he?
- He's the major shareholder.
He's effectively your partner.
And he said, "I do hope we do not have our own Conrad Black at Reynholm Industries".
Conrad Black - the first rich person to go to prison in 300 years.
- You see it's serious?
- What do you want from me?
I just want you to stay out of trouble.
Just do nothing until the conference call tomorrow.
Let me get this right.
You want me to do absolutely nothing?
Just stay out of trouble - that's all I ask.
You want me to sit on my arse all day?
I think I can handle that.
I don't think I've ever looked in this drawer.
Wow!
A gun!
Roy, I'd love to take you through my changes to the video-conferencing system in the meeting room, but maybe I'm boring you.
I'll never see that Â£20 again!
I can't believe you're not interested in the sweet flip switch I've installed.
Â£20 doesn't even register to him as an amount of money!
He won't remember it.
Hello, IT.
Have you tried turning it Is this the guy?
I need to know.
I can't sit here all day staring at him.
It really looked like him, Jen.
I'm 80% sure it's him.
- Are you winding me up?
!
- What?
You've gone down 15%!
It's still high.
I am sitting here like an idiot, and you've gone down about 15%!
Jen, how can you be keeping an eye on him while you're talking to me as well?
- Hi, Gary.
- All right?
Sorry, I thought you were in the toilet.
I just wondered, erm if you fancied a cup of tea.
- Just made you one.
- Oh, yeah.
Great.
Thanks.
- So how's it all going?
- I've finished that other wall.
Great.
And that architrave ain't going to be a problem.
And the eggshell's come up really well.
Yeah, it's classy.
It's really good.
Thank you for the cup of tea.
Oh, I should probably do that.
Dear Douglas, if you're reading this, you've found my father's service revolver.
Hell's horses!
I did plan on using this gun to take my own life, if it came to it, but as you know, in the end I jumped out of a window.
I pass it on to you in the hope that if things ever get too bad, you'll be able to take the easy way out.
Hopefully it won't come to it, but if it does, promise me that you'll shoot yourself without a moment's hesitation.
I promise, Father.
Your affectionate father, Mr Reynholm.
I wonder if it's loaded.
No.
Ah!
Here we go.
- You off somewhere?
- Erm, yeah.
Yeah?
So, er what's next on the agenda?
- Look, Jen, I know what's going on.
- You do?
And it's fine.
I understand, I really do.
Oh, so you understand how I feel.
Yeah, but you are barking up the wrong tree.
I mean, I think you're a top bird and everything, but you're not really my type.
I mean, I like tall beautiful girls.
I don't fancy you, you big, ugly builder.
I'm trying to stop you having a piddle party in my house!
- What?
- Builders From Hell.
Ring any bells?
- I don't know what you mean.
- You do.
I don't.
You haven't been on Builders From Hell?
- No, I haven't.
- Oh, really?
!
- Yes, really.
- Really?
!
Really!
Well let's forget about it.
Shall we?
This conversation's beneath us.
Wow, I love what you've done to that wall, Gary.
I haven't done that wall yet.
You haven't even done it, and I love it!
God, we should You and I should stay in touch.
I would like to stay in touch with you cos we've got a a-a-a-a rapport, haven't haven't we?
We've clicked.
We have, we've clicked.
Haven't we?
In a way.
In a in a in a weird way that friends friends usually click.
"A big, ugly builder".
You.
This is all because of you.
Jen, I didn't bring his weight into it!
You said you were 99% sure.
Oh, I don't think I ever went that high.
I've always thought it was about 60/40.
Now that I think about it, Jen, I'm pretty sure that the guy on the programme was black.
Well, at least I don't have to worry about him going on a toilet tour of my house.
Unless he's so angry that he does it out of spite.
What?
Well, if someone called me a "big, ugly builder", I'd be furious-- and not just because I'm actually an IT consultant.
Revenge, that would be uppermost upon my mind: - "I'm going to wee on everything".
- Oh, God!
- "I'm going to taint her abode".
- Oh!
"I'm going to strain my personal potatoes throughout her premises".
Oh, God!
- Nice glasses!
- Not as nice as your momma's glasses!
It's a little bit complimentary, but we'll work on it.
I can't hang around the house - he'll know I don't trust him.
But I can't leave him on his own.
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do, Roy?
Jen, just relax, OK?
I've often found that the best solution is the simplest.
- Thanks again for doing this, Roy.
- No problem, Jen.
It's brilliantly easy to spy on people these days.
- He won't see the cameras, will he?
- Oh, no, no.
They're pretty well hidden.
He's muttering a lot.
Have you noticed?
Mm-hm.
"Fat, ugly builder"!
Take that, lollipop man!
Wow!
My grandfather's old service revolver.
To think of all the deserters he shot in the head with this!
Are you ready?
- Ready for what?
- Japan!
Oh, is that meeting today?
Hell's bells!
You go ahead.
I'll be right there.
I've just What was that?
!
- What was what?
- That noise.
- What noise?
- The loud explosion!
Loud explosion?
What on earth are you talking about?
!
- You didn't hear that just then?
- What are you talking about?
You come in here, ranting about gunshots and service revolvers-- I've had enough!
Get out!
Go!
Go to the meeting.
I'll be right there.
Hello.
Does someone have a problem with their laptop?
Now, you listen to me - this is very important.
I have a vital meeting to attend, and I've just shot myself in the leg.
Uh-huh?
I want you to dial 999.
No, it's a new number - # 011 Whatever the new number is get an ambulance and ask it to wait, and I'll be there in two hours, three hours tops.
Are you ready?
I was born ready.
OK, Roy, we're on.
J'accuse!
Gotcha!
OK, how do you record?
How do you record on this?
Roy?
Roy?
Roy, how do you record?
OK we're on.
Mr Yamamoto, hello.
He is angry!
Well, lots to think about there.
Thoughts, anyone?
No?
We'll reconvene tomorrow.
Thank you, everyone.
But but what did it all mean?
- Mr Reynholm, are you all right?
- I'm fine, yes.
Yes, I'm fine.
Erm I'm going to go.
I may not come back.
But I want to say this: that accounts team I had every last one of them.
Just a little bit further, son.
Father?
!
Is it really you?
- Is this really heaven?
- Yes, yes.
Hurry up, come on.
I'm coming, Father.
I'm ready.
Whoa there!
- Was that Hitler?
- Was what Hitler?
That looked like Hitler.
That wasn't Hitler, that was a woman.
Really?
Well, it looked exactly like Hitler.
We're having a heaven party, and that's a Hitlergram.
Right, well, I don't think I'm quite ready yet.
- Come on!
- No.
I'll see you later.
I've still got a lot of work to do.
- I'll see you later, Douglas.
- Not if I see you first.
must call Mark Thatcher I'm alive!
Nolan!
My accounting team!
And Roy gentle, Irish Roy.
Thank you for being by my side while I awake.
No problem, sir.
We don't want you going anywhere.
Isn't it lucky to see an Irishman when you awake from a near-death experience?
I've heard that.
Even if it isn't, I appreciate it, Roy, and I count myself lucky to have you as a friend.
He's exhausted.
We should go.
I'll stay with him, make sure he's OK.
Got you, you crafty Irish bastard!
I've got a gun!
I've got a ruddy gun!
I've got a flipping gun!
I've got a flipping gun!
I've got a mother-flipping gun!
I've got a mother-flipping gun!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
1 - Is this your stapler, Roy?
- No.
- No, it's not.
- I used it for one thing.
- How many staples did you use?
- 6 or 7.
1, 2, 3, 4 Is that 5?
6 Is that 7?
- Why do you need to know?
- I just do.
I need to know.
You know I need to know, and you never count how many staples you've used.
8, 9 Better do it in fives.
5, 10, 15 - Is that 20?
- There you go, Moss.
Awright, Harry?
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
What was Wenger thinking, sending Walcott on that early?
Thing about Arsenal, they always try and walk it in.
- That is true.
See you later, Moss.
- Mind how you go.
- What was that?
- What?
You were saying football things, in a football voice!
Oh, it's this new site.
It sends you a list of football phrases that you can use in normal conversation, updated daily.
It's great.
I only use it so I can talk to the postman.
It's got a pronunciation guide-- or pronunciation guide.
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
You can get it sent to your phone, so that even when I'm away from my desk I can still sound like I'm just a big, normal man.
45, 50 Hey, Moss, send me a link for that, will you?
Right, I'm off.
- Bit early.
- Got a date.
- Oh, right, with Michael?
- That's right.
- The guy who looks like a magician!
- Yeah.
- What?
- What?
What did you say?
He looks like a what?
This Michael, the guy that came in last week?
He doesn't look like a magician.
Yeah, he does.
- Doesn't he, Moss?
- Hm?
Remember the guy that came in looking for Jen last week?
Ah, Michael the Magnificent.
- He doesn't look like a magician.
- He does.
- He doesn't.
- He massively does.
- He does, Jen.
- Oh, shut up.
It's a lovely restaurant.
Isn't it?
It's one of my favourites, actually.
One of the silly things I love about this restaurant, have you had a look at these salt and pepper pots?
They're beautiful.
There's something about them, the shape I'm a bit of a design freak, but it's beautiful What are they saying that could possibly be that funny?
I'm funny.
Why can't I be over there making them laugh?
They're proper men, Roy.
We're men.
We're proper men.
What's so different about us?
7, 14, 21, 35, 42, 49 35 7 Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
21, 28 Come Referee Aw Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
What's Wenger doing sending Walcott on that early?
The thing about Arsenal is they always try and walk it in.
- Exactly!
Dan.
- Roy.
Chelsea, on the other hand, I like them suddenly.
Yeah Chelsea?
You're having a laugh, in't ya?
Whoa!
I'll put money on it if you like.
Nah, I've got a pony on Liverpool, so I probably won't see that again.
D'uh!
- Dan, Moss.
Moss, Dan.
- Nice to meet you, son.
- You want a drink, boys?
- We'll get this.
Nah, it's on me.
Whatever these boys are 'aving.
- Here he is!
- Oi-oi!
- Oi-oi!
- Oi.
Roy, Moss, Derek, Luke.
Moss here fancies Liverpool for the weekend.
Liverpool?
You're having a laugh, in't ya?
- He's put a pony on it!
- Pony?
Yeah!
Tell Barry, tell Barry.
- Tell me what?
- He's only put a pony on Liverpool!
You lunatic, eh!
So who do you support?
- Who do I support?
- Yeah.
West Ham.
Did you say West Ham?
Is that all right?
All right?
What does that look like, a birthmark?
Did you see that?
My face!
Roy, can I have a natter with you?
It's about private man's business.
I'm sure you boys will understand.
Excuse me, please.
I'm a little bit scared and I want to leave.
What?
We're in too deep, Roy.
I'm worried they'll find out I don't know what a pony is.
- We should go.
- I'm not going anywhere.
I haven't paid for a drink all night, and besides, once you get over the football thing, they're surprisingly easy to talk to.
Maybe we're proper men!
We're messing with stuff we don't understand.
We're through the looking glass.
Just promise me you will not let this get too far.
I promise.
Hooray, he's kicked the ball.
Now the ball's over there.
That man has it now.
That's an interesting development.
Maybe he'll kick the ball.
He has indeed, and apparently that deserves a round of applause.
You shut up.
They're gonna hear you.
This is the worst thing in the world.
What could I do?
He bought the tickets when we were in the pub.
I could hardly say no, could I?
- Shall I use this?
- I don't know.
Look, they're singing!
Maybe we should sing.
Just promise we won't do anything else with them.
I want to go back to being weird.
I like being weird.
Weird's all I've got - that and my sweet style.
OK, look, we'll make our excuses when the match is over.
- How long do football matches last?
- A billion hours, apparently.
Listen we're gonna play a little poker tonight.
You game?
I'm in.
Moss?
- I won't, Dan, no.
- Come on.
- No, no can do.
I'm seeing a bird.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, why not?
- What's she like?
Well, she's not much to look at, but she is very kind-hearted, so, as I say, I've got to vamoosh.
- What, you're not watching it?
- They're having a laugh today.
- They're winning.
- No, they're having a laugh.
Morning.
Oh, my word.
When did the English start drinking like that?
You people drink like you don't want to live!
We do love to binge.
- What happened to you?
- I've got cockney neck.
I've been speaking too much cockney and it's done my blooming neck in.
Oh, here she is, Debbie McGee.
Morning all.
I'm off to break up with him.
What's wrong with you two?
- We've been hanging out with men.
- Why are you breaking up with him?
Why?
What do you mean, why?
Because he looks like a magician.
- Doesn't he, though?
- Oh, he totally does.
And ever since you two said it I can't get it out of my head.
So thanks, thanks a lot-- another one bites the dust.
You're not really breaking up with him because of that, are you?
I can't be seen with that mentalist.
Do you know what he does for a living?
He is a driving instructor.
A driving instructor who looks like a magician.
It's preposterous!
That's almost the worst look a driving instructor could have.
- So distracting.
- Only a clown would be worse.
Mm.
Or a mountie.
So, how was your night of poker with the boys?
Yeah, good, good.
I mean, I didn't I wasn't brilliant at the start, because, you know, I was mostly vomiting.
Lovely.
But then I knuckled down and I brought my A game, and, er things got a lot better.
That's good.
How much did you win?
Er, no, no, I lost Â£200.
But it's less than I usually lose, so Still, Â£200, though.
But listen to this: Dan let me off.
He just totally let me off.
Proper men are so cool - they just don't care about money.
- Hello?
- Where's my fucking money?
!
- I want that money!
Give me my money!
- OK Really?
I'm only joking, you muppet!
Oh, you're funny Roy, listen, a friend of mine's let me down with something.
Can you meet me at lunch?
Yeah, OK, OK I just went to the toilet.
OK, what's the address?
- Here he is.
- Hiya, Dan.
- You got here.
- Oi-oi, boys.
All right, mate?
- You all right?
- Yeah, er, pretty good.
- Hey, sorry again about last night.
- Nah, don't mention it.
Listen, that favour - you wouldn't be available to do a little taxi job?
You want me to drive?
This?
Erm Yeah, yeah, I suppose so.
As I say, someone's let me down.
It should only take a couple of hours.
It's no problem.
Oh, is it an automatic?
Cos I can only drive an automatic.
Oh, it is an automatic.
I'm your man.
You're sure everything with the money is OK?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
This makes us totally quits.
You, sir, are a gentleman.
This guy, huh?
Here we go.
Pull over here, Roy.
OK You have reached your destination.
- All right, everyone.
- Take your time.
Oh, wait, how do you get the radio to work?
Oh, no, no, it's OK, I've got it, I've got it.
Oh, I love this one.
Yeah?
- Hey, man.
- Hello.
- Hey, want to meet up after this?
- Yeah.
Nothing's happening here.
The guys have this, er, lock-up down by the gasworks on Newcombe Road.
The gasworks?
Is there anything about them that's not manly?
Jesus!
- Moss!
Jesus Christ!
- What?
what is it?
There's a robbery!
Across the road, right here!
There's a robbery!
Oh, some blokes in balaclavas Wow!
They're totally robbing this place!
- Call the police, call the police!
- Yeah.
Bye.
Police, please.
Yeah, hi, I'm on Denbury Road and there is a robbery taking place right now.
Three men, indiscriminate race, balaclavas, big guns.
Yeah, OK Oh, my God, they're coming out, they're coming out.
Yeah, OK, they're coming out They're running towards us They're running towards the car.
Oh, they're Drive!
Okie-dokie Oh, fuck - Straight ahead, Roy.
- OK.
Keep going, mate.
Right, swing a left here.
Right, drive up those ramps there.
Right, drive up the ramps into the truck.
- Come on, Roy, quickly!
- Yep, okie-doke.
- OK - Come on!
Am I on it?
Am I on the track?
I can't see.
Oh, no Sorry, sorry, sorry.
What are you doing?
!
Get on with it!
- Just get it up there!
- I don't fucking believe this!
Take two.
This is the one.
OK Up, up, up, up we go, into the truck.
- What's that?
Is someone crying?
- No Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
What was Wenger thinking, bringing Walcott on that early?
The thing about Arsenal is they always try and walk it in.
But why?
I don't understand.
I thought it was going so well.
- Was it something I did?
- No, no.
It's hard to explain.
Tell me, Jen, for God's sake.
You owe me that much.
You look like a magician, Michael.
All right?
I'm sorry, but you do.
I didn't notice at first, but someone mentioned it and now I can't get it out of my head.
It's driving me mad.
- But I'm not a magician.
- I know.
That's why it's not good that you look like one.
Well, what is it, exactly, about me?
It's everything.
There's nothing about you that doesn't look like a magician.
It's everything.
Don't you see it?
Don't you wake up every morning and look in the mirror and think, "Jesus Christ, I look like a magician"?
- No.
- Well, you should.
I would, if I was a weirdy-beardy magiciany man.
I'm just trying to help you, Michael.
So it's over because of that?
I don't see any way past it.
It's weird.
It's weird for me.
- I'm sorry.
- No, wait.
Maybe we can think of something.
What if I actually learned some magic tricks?
What do you mean?
Well, perhaps if I learned some tricks, it wouldn't feel so strange that I look like a magician.
You'd have to learn a lot of tricks.
I mean, you'd basically have to actually become a magician.
Do you really want to make that kind of commitment?
We was stitched up.
They knew we were there.
Shut up.
It was always a possibility.
That's why we had the truck.
We were barely out of there before the Bill turned up.
Someone grassed us up.
Oh, is that the?
I have to go.
I don't want to miss Gok's Fashion Fix.
You're too quick to trust people.
What do we know about this bloke?
How do we know he didn't make a call?
He didn't know about it till this afternoon.
I didn't know about it.
That's why I chose him after you shot Derek.
That's why he chose me after you shot Derek.
Hello!
Hiya.
You remember Moss.
So, tell me all about the big robbery.
What?
Roy saw a robbery.
Did you phone the police like you said you would?
I didn't say that.
I said I was listening to The Police.
Look at all that money.
I wonder how much is there.
1, 2, 3, 4 You and your bloody great ideas.
I mean, who's this bloke?
All we know about him is he supports West Ham.
- Or maybe that's a lie, too.
- Hey!
Hey now, little man!
You can stand there and slag me off all you like, but don't you start talking about how I feel about my beloved West Ham, because I love 'em.
- I love them Gooners!
- That's bloody Arsenal.
You got a problem with him, you got a problem with me.
You're fucking right I've got a problem!
Excuse me, I am trying to concentrate!
And will you watch your ruddy language?
My ears are not a toilet.
Derek was right about you.
What are you after?
My piece of the action?
- Wanna end up in the boot with Derek?
- You wanna make one?
- I'll make one, mate.
Right now.
- Let's have it, then.
- Don't you mug yourself.
Don't mug yourself!
- Let's have it!
Do it!
- I need to know how much is there.
- No, you don't.
We need to get out of here, OK?
We do not want to get mixed up in this.
Oh, f - What are we gonna do now?
- Quick!
Get out of the way, you bloody poofs!
OK, let's go.
Couldn't we have just have hidden behind those bins?
I suppose.
Right, let's go.
So, er, if you just place these back into the pack Just pop it back in, that's it.
Sorry I'm a bit nervous.
And, erm, before your very eyes I shall do the magic shuffle and Ignore that.
This will go in here and Bob's your uncle, abracadabra, is this your card?
No, Michael.
I'm sorry, Michael, it's over.
I'd better make sure she's all right.
Anyone see the final last night, then?
Fuck off, Harry!
50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600 I think my dentist lives near here.
Do you know him?
That's a stupid question.
Why would you know him?
It's not like you live in the truck.
So what sort of truck is this?
Are there different sorts of trucks?
Is that a stupid question?
Listen to me chatting away like Stephen bloody Fry!
Who closed the door?

1 Previously on "The IT Crowd".
Douglas receives a love potion from a mysterious blind man in the desert.
Enraptured with the lovely Jen Barber, an employee of Reynholm Industries, he administers the potion in the hope of enslaving her heart.
When Douglas drinks the concoction by mistake, which turns out to be Rohypnol, he becomes incredibly aroused, even though Rohypnol would really only make you tired.
Jen locks him in with Moss and Roy, with whom he attempts to achieve sexual congress.
An enraged Jen embarks on a lengthy legal process, using brilliant lawyer Jon Rergen, a friend of her auntie's.
After months of legal wrangling, an amicable agreement is finally reached.
You're robbing me blind, Jen.
Sign here, here, here Yeah, and I reckon I know where to sign on a sexual harassment settlement, thank you!
I've got to thank you, Jen, for not taking this matter any further.
Not only does that show great maturity, but also - Is she asleep?
- I'm not asleep!
- All right.
- It's not just the money.
- I know.
- There's a principle involved.
Parting with the money was painful enough, but the electric pants I have to wear at work so I don't become aroused, they're also painful.
Excuse me I'm just charging them.
Don't say anything that will get me going, either of you.
Does it hurt - you know, when you?
It's like being Tased in the balls.
- Tea?
- No, thank you.
Like being Tased in the balls except painful.
So, Jen, what are you gonna do with your 500 quid?
I don't know.
I still feel we could have got more.
- Now, Jen, we've been through this.
- He tried to use Rohypnol on me.
I thought it was a magic potion.
If this went to court, it'd be your word against mine.
Who are they going to believe?
A woman or an Englishman?
Oh, up yours!
That wasn't even sexy.
These pants are broken.
Urgh!
Urgh!
Sorry to bother you, mate, but I've just found out my mum's been taken into hospital.
- My sister'd go, but she moved to Australia.
- Australia?
I really need to get down there, but my car's broken down.
- Look, here's 50p.
- That's great.
It's all I've got.
And it's 50p more than that story deserves.
Right.
I can't believe you got more than me.
Why wouldn't we?
We were violated, too.
Violated?
!
He chased you around the table.
- He kissed Moss.
- Right on the lips, apparently.
- Don't you remember?
- No.
I went to "Moss's happy place".
You two are useless.
If we'd stuck together, we might have made some real money.
Â£550 is not to be sniffed at, Jen.
No, and neither's Â£560.
I tell you, if that's the kind of money I can make, I'm going to start dressing even more provocatively.
You can save some of that for Freddie.
What?
What's this?
You know this.
Freddie, who did the charity thing where he tied the balloons to the chair.
- Oh, yeah.
- Such a lovely idea floating from London to Glasgow to promote optimism.
Anyway, there's a collection for his wife and kids, so you'd both better cough up.
Moss, what would be an appropriate amount to give to Freddie's wife and kids?
I suppose normally about Â£5.
But seeing as we just got all that money, Â£50?
That seems fair.
Let's split the difference and call it a tenner.
Hello?
Hello?
Douglas, I know this is you.
Aargh!
Jesus, this bloody thing!
Are you all right, Olive?
You look a bit peaky.
Yes, I'm I don't feel up to it any more.
I feel sort of dizzy all of a sudden.
Well, you're terrifically old.
But don't worry, not long now until you're at peace.
I've done it!
Oh!
I've done it.
I'm up against the boss now.
It's a giant spider shooting out all these little baby spiders.
That's brilliant.
- I'm going nowhere down here.
- Nowhere.
I'm going to Where's Moss?
I'm going to finish this bitch off, Moss!
- It's a dead end.
- They don't come any deader.
OK, sweetcheeks, here comes the pain!
You guys, do you even need a relationship manager?
Stay down!
Stay down, bitch!
I'm dead!
Oh!
No, exactly, Jen.
No offence, but I object to the idea we even need management, like we're a pair of nitwits that don't know how to take care of ourselves.
- It's insulting is what it is.
- Yeah.
Yeah I suppose you're right.
- Sandwich.
- Oh, right.
- Coffee.
- What?
No, no, no!
Got you!
That one's empty, this is the real one.
I've been planning that for ages.
The look on your face!
- Jen?
- Yeah?
Don't come in here for a bit.
Why haven't you put on a clean T-shirt?
I don't have a spare.
Someone's looking for help on 10, so No, Moss can do it.
Moss can't do it.
He's slightly concussed.
- Yeah, all right, I'll go.
- I won't be here this afternoon.
- I've got a job interview.
- Oh.
OK.
Good for you, Jen - seriously.
We don't need a manager - it's a non-job.
So you go out there and you knock 'em dead.
Hello, Jen!
It's Moss.
From work?
For God's sake!
Twats!
What happened?
She just collapsed.
I phoned for an ambulance.
- Give us your jacket, mate.
- What?
- She looks cold.
- She doesn't look cold.
- What?
!
- Just give us your jacket.
She's fine!
You're fine, aren't you, Olive?
- She's moving about.
- Ohhhh!
And she's talking.
That's it, keep the spirits up, Olive.
- I'm cold!
- It's all in your head, Olive.
- Your jacket.
- What?
Come on.
Hurry up.
Thank you.
Right.
Come on.
Here we go.
Hell's teeth!
I'm not aroused.
It's only cars.
God damn these electric sex pants!
Check you out, mate!
Isn't it just so funny and interesting that I don't have a shirt on?
!
Oh, hello!
Let's all make hilarious comments about it.
Everyone?
Excuse me.
Erm As you know, they found Freddie's body yesterday.
I don't There's nothing I can say that'll make that fact any less horrible.
But perhaps we can bow our heads for a minute and think about Freddie and remember what he meant to us.
Hey, everybody, look at me!
Huh?
Let's get it over with.
Let's all have a big laugh at the topless man!
Look at me!
Ooh, look at me, I have no shirt.
Where's my clothes?
Ooh, look at these fellas!
Aren't I sexy?
Sexy in my nakedness.
We're in the middle of a minute's silence - Freddie's body was found.
If you can give us a couple of minutes.
I work here!
I fucking work here!
Ow!
Ow!
OK.
All right.
Ow!
OK!
I work in IT!
My pass is in my jacket.
My pass is in my jacket!
You bastards!
I work here!
It's madness!
- Lovely cup of tea.
- Ah, thank you.
Well, I have to say, I like what I see, Jen.
You're young, ambitious, intelligent - just the sort of person I like to have around.
Ha-ha-ha!
Well, I'm no Stephen Hawkins, don't get me wrong, but you can't work as long as I have in I without having a pretty firm grasp of the essentials.
You know, what exactly does "IT" stand for?
I've often wondered, but I never thought to ask.
I'm sorry, what was the question?
What does "IT" stand for?
What does it stand for?
What doesn't it stand for!
Yes, yes, but what does it stand for?
It stands for It stands for commitment.
It stands for audacity.
It stands for courage in the face of Yes, yes.
I can see what you're getting at.
But the specific letters, I-T, what do they stand for?
- What do you think they stand for?
- Perhaps I'm not making myself clear.
- I'm not looking for an interpretation.
- Oh.
I really don't know what the letters actually stand for.
- Ha-ha-ha-ha.
- So let's start with the I. What does the I stand for?
- I need to wee-wee.
- What?
I mean "go to the toilet".
Sorry, I don't normally say "wee-wee".
It's just I'm bursting.
Hello, Roy speaking.
What?
!
Moss?
You're still concussed.
You need to see the doctor.
Who is this?
Roy?
Wait, it couldn't be Roy - I'm Roy.
- Look, look, what does "IT" mean?
- What?
"IT" - what does it mean?
Someone asked me.
- You don't know what it means?
- No, I never thought to ask.
- This must be Jen.
- Yes.
- Hello, Jen!
- Hello.
- How may I help you?
- Ohhh Tell me what "IT" means.
Absolutely.
- Well?
- Very well, thank you.
How are you?
Moss, just stay with me for this simple question - I'm just going to put you on speakerphone.
- No, don't hang up!
Jen, you are now on speakerphone.
Jen?
Hello, Jen?
Jen, bear with me one moment.
Someone's trying to get through on the other line.
- Roy speaking.
- You just hung up on me.
- Hold on a sec.
Jen's on the other line.
- No!
Jen, can I call you back?
Jen's trying to get through on the other line.
Jen, sorry about that.
Chicken in a basket!
It has been all ruddy go today.
Now, how may I help you?
What does "IT" mean?
!
You know, computers - something to do with computers probably.
Computers?
That's not really my area.
Jen, I'd love to help you, but it's a real pain - I seem to have forgotten absolutely everything I know about computers.
How can you forget everything you know?
Let me see.
Maybe it isn't everything.
No, it's definitely everything.
Excuse me, could I trouble you for 50 pence for a phone call?
Excuse me, mate.
I'm sorry to bother you, but, erm my mate threw coffee all over me, then this old woman stole my jacket, and they chucked me out of the building where I work.
And now I just need 50p for a phone call so I can get back to work.
Oh, that's better.
Good, good.
Now, erm where were we?
Oh, God, I can't remember.
I hate it when that happens.
Wow!
Is this a wooden desk?
Oh, no, I remember, you were going to tell me what "IT" means.
Right.
I don't know what it means, all right?
I never thought to It didn't really affect me.
I'm too busy managing one man whose idea of an adult night out is Laser Quest followed by pornography, and another who collects wires.
Have you heard Guided By Voices?
They're a band.
- No.
- I have.
I've heard everything they've ever done.
They're good.
I'm a bit of a fan now.
- Isn't that good?
- I shouldn't even know who they are!
They've turned me into one of them.
I am one of them.
That's why you need me.
I am your conduit.
I am your bridge.
Ich.
Bin.
Ein.
Nerd.
Welcome aboard.
How can that be erotic?
!
Good God!
Get me IT.
You there, computer man, fix my pants.
- Beg your pardon?
- Pull down my trousers and do your job.
Roy?
!
Jen?
Jen!
Oh, Jen!
Oh, Jen!
- Oh, Jen!
- Get off me.
It's been horrible!
Horrible!
The worst two hours of my life!
All right Hello, everybody, and welcome to this, our first inter-faith tour of Reynholm Industries.
I thought we'd start with the IT department because, to be honest, we tend to forget about them a bit, buried down here in the basement, and they really are lovely guys.
- Let's go in and say hello.
- But I don't know what it is.
Just pull that thing there, fiddle about with it.
Fuck off!
- Try that wire.
- Who are you?
I'm free at last.
I could get to like these.
Just the job.
Good work.
Mmm!
Nice and loose.
I'm in my happy place.
I'm in my happy place.
I'm in my happy place.
I'm in my happy place.
I'm in my happy place.
I'm in my happy place.
- Hello?
- Hello, June.
Jen!
Hello.
How can I help you?
Thank you, but I'm going to have to turn your offer down.
Oh.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Why?
- Personal reasons.
- OK.
Well, if you change your mind, you know where I am.
- Thank you.
- Did you ever find out what "IT" stands for?
Piss off, June.
Who wants tea?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Wow.
That's quite something.
Quite an honour.
I know.
They really must be very impressed with you.
I didn't even know they had an employee of the month thing here.
Really?
I thought you won it once.
No, that was everyone thought I was dead.
A-ha.
Hmm, employee of the month.
Yeah, it's, it's a valued title.
Have you ever won it?
Er, no.
No, I haven't.
I don't know, Jen, sometimes I think it's because I just want it, so damn much!
I am the employee of the month.
And yet, to a casual observer, it would appear that you do very little around here.
Yeah, they must have seen through that.
I think someone up there must have sensed something in me.
Something I've always known was there, er a greatness?
No, I'm not saying that, buti mean, something Yeah, yeah, I'm sensing something.
Don't worry, I won't let it go to my head.
Moss, guess who's won employee of the month?
-Roy.
-No.
-Richmond.
-No.
Harry.
Who's Harry?
-The postman.
-No.
Me.
No.
I said Roy, right?
Richmond?
Me!
Oh, about time!
Whatever happened to Richmond?
He got scurvy.
subsBusters proudly presents The.
IT.
Crowd.
S03E04 Can you be more specific?
I'm trying to picture your role in Reynholm Industries.
Well, I'm the boss, head honcho, el numero uno, Mr Big, The Godfather, Lord Of The Rings, the Bourne Identity, er Taxi Driver, Jaws.
I forgot the question, quite a while back.
Who are you again?
I'm April Shepherd.
You've been my Richest magazine's Man Of The Year.
I'm doing the profile.
Oh yes, that's right.
I know you're the boss, but what does that entail?
Oh, many things.
Like this morning, for instance.
I had to choose the Employee Of The Month, from the box.
May I ask, what are you doing on that pad?
One of my little hobbies is caricature.
Sometimes, I like to sketch someone as I'm talking to them.
May I?
Well, I'm not very good.
I'm no Truman Capote.
Great, OK.
Um I'll tell you what, let's just do some quick-fire questions.
Maybe they'll give me an insight into the real you.
-OK.
-Right Tell me, who's your favourite person from history?
Sherlock Holmes.
Well, he's fictional.
Whoa!
I think you'd better check your facts there.
Fictional?
Who took care of the business with the giant dog that was eating everybody?
Well, it wasn't Watson.
Don't tell me, I suppose he was fictional too.
Maybe there was no giant dog.
No, no, I think you're playing games with me, young lady.
OK, then, favourite fictional character.
Oh, ha-ha, ha!
The Elephant Man.
Tell you what, let me widen the question out.
Favourite popular figure?
Churchill.
Well, what is it you like about him?
I love the way he says, "Oh, yes.
Oh, yes".
I think, perhaps it's you who's playing games with me.
You're a very surprising man, Mr Reynholm.
Yes.
I am a surprising man.
April, may I take you to dinner?
Oh, I don't think I could..
In Paris.
Paris?
Paris, yes.
It's the name of a new restaurant in Hull.
That's right, we're going to Hull!
"The biggest adventure you can ever take "is to live the life of your dreams" - Oprah Winfrey.
I suppose that is the biggest adventure.
Guys, come on in.
Sit down.
Is this a new desk?
Yeah, I thought I needed some new furniture.
So, I got some stuff from upstairs.
Sit down, please.
I just thought, what with all this extra attention on us on me, it might be worth looking at ourselves and saying, "Hey, am I really giving it 110 per cent"?
And if not, "Why not?
What the heck is wrong with me?
"Am I mentally ill or something"?
Roy, let's start with you.
When you're upstairs, fiddling about with computers would it hurt to smile?
Don't you realise what a difference that would make?
Eh?
Come on, let's see a smile now, come on.
No, more warmth, warmer.
You're just showing more teeth, that's not warmth.
I would say that's more of a threatening look, actually.
I'll tell you what, Roy, keep at it.
That's your homework.
Moss.
So, what's your speech going to be about?
What speech?
Every employee of the month has to give a speech in their area of expertise.
Which for you is computers.
Where do I have to?
At the monthly shareholders meeting.
When do I have to?
Friday.
What time?
Morning.
How's that?
What's up, guys?
All right, Jen?
Urgh!
God!
Just writing a speech.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
How's that going?
Good, good, good, good You know, I was thinking, er if there's anything you guys wanna say, I can put it in, it's no problem.
Oh, oh, yeah, oh, mm, interesting.
Um, is there anything you'd like to say to the shareholders, Moss?
Just say, "Hi".
Say, "Hi," from us.
OK.
I love this.
I wonder how many more times she's gonna come in.
You know, I think, maybe, it'd be a good idea if you two contributed to this, I really do.
Oh, yeah.
Why?
Hmm.
I think, I think it would give you experience in writing a speech for a public figure.
Well, obviously, in our line of work that would be handy.
But, you know what, Jen, I'm actually, I'm snowed under here.
Wait a second!
Wait a second!
Oh, oh, what are we doing?
Eh?
We should totally write that speech!
-What?
Why?
-Okay Offer to write the speech for Jen.
No.
You have to!
I cannot do it!
She'll know something's up if I do it!
-You have to do it!
-Why would I do that?
Moss, do you trust me?
No.
Do you trust me?
No.
Right, If you trust me, then offer to write that speech!
I. Don't.
Trust.
You.
Hi.
'I feel really bad having all the fun writing this speech.
'  Well, I suppose we could write the speech so that, you know, you look like you know what you're talking about.
Thanks, I'm off for lunch.
Leave it on my desk.
My God.
I know.
That's brilliant.
So, now you understand why we have to write that speech for Jen.
She will say anything we tell her to.
She will say anything we tell her to.
We can put any old bollocks in that speech and she shall repeat it.
It's going to be hilarious.
Sometimes I could kiss your mind, Roy.
OK, so let's just, um I don't know, let's just throw around a few ideas.
OK.
OK.
Ahoh, could we tell her that there's an apple inside every Apple Mac?
-It's good.
-Yeah.
We could say that Bill Gates is called Bill Gates, because he owns a lot of gates.
Hmmm.
That's good, but it's not quite punchy enough, and it's probably true now anyway.
I'll bet he does own a lot of gates.
He probably does.
It's got to be something big!
I think I may have it.
What?
You best put seatbelts on your ears, Roy, 'cause I'm gonna take them for the ride of their lives!
Delightful.
Oh, no, no, no.
You're silly.
Do you know, I've never been so enchanted by a woman in all my life.
What's your name again?
I know you told me.
April.
Ah, what a charming name.
Always been one of my favourites.
April, after dinner, would you do me the honour of accompanying me to my bed?
Oh, erm No, I've said too much!
I've let my heart overpower my head, which is my wont.
But I don't care.
I find you enchanting.
And there's a condom machine in the toilet.
I've checked!
I'm very flattered, Douglas but, erm, -there's a problem, something I should tell you.
-Go on.
Erm, I I have a secret.
I could dance around the subject, but I like you, Douglas.
I want to be straight with you.
Oh?
I used to be a man, Douglas.
I used to be a man.
I wish there was an easier way of saying that, but, believe me, there's not.
I've had a lot of hormone therapy and a number of operations.
I'm really sorry.
I hope you don't feel I deceived you.
I understand if you would rather I left.
I don't care.
What?
Doesn't bother me.
Doesn't bother you at all?
It takes all sorts to make a world.
Wow, it bothers most men.
I am not most men and the offer still stands.
Are you up for it?
Amazing, just amazing.
You liked it?
You really know your way around that area.
Well Tell me, what are you doing tomorrow night, April?
I was thinking of staying in and watching the darts.
You've read my mind.
'60s Swing music What is it?
This, Jen, is the internet.
What?
That's right.
This is the internet?
The whole internet?
Yep.
I asked for a loan of it, so that you could use it in your speech.
It's so small.
That's one of the surprising things about it.
Hang on, it doesn't have any wires or anything.
It's wireless.
Oh, yes, everything's wireless nowadays, yeah.
I can use it in my speech?
What if someone needs it?
Oh, no, no, people still be able to go online.
It will still work.
Oh, good.
Good.
I tell you, you present this to the shareholders and you will get quite a response.
Can I touch it?
Ooh, it's so light.
Of course it is, Jen.
The internet doesn't weigh anything.
Ha-ha.
No, of course it doesn't.
Ha-ha.
Ha-ha.
Hey!
What is Jen doing with the internet?
Moss said I could use it for my speech.
Are you insane?
What if she drops it?
I won't drop it, I'll look after it.
No.
No, no, no, no, Jen.
No, this needs to go straight back to Big Ben.
Big Ben?
It goes on top of Big Ben.
That's where you get the best reception.
I promise I won't let anything happen to it.
No, Jen, I'm sorry.
The elders of the internet would never stand for it.
No, no, Roy.
I spoke to the elders of the internet, not one hour ago.
I told them Jen had won employee of the month and they were so impressed - wanted to do whatever they could to help.
Wait a minute, the elders of the internet?
The elders of the internet know who I am?
You've got to let me have it!
No, Jen, I'm sorry, it's just too risky.
Oh, please, Roy.
Well, Moss, has it been completely demagnetised?
By Stephen Hawking himself.
He sends his congratulations.
Well, if it's OK with the Hawk.
So, can I have it?
You can.
Oh, don't forget your speech.
Oh, thank you.
Slowly.
April, these past few days have been like a dream.
Usually, I can't wait to get away from a woman once I've ejaculated, but with you, I don't know, I feel alive.
April, I love you.
What?
That's right, I totally love the bloody arse off you.
Oh, Douglas, I love you too.
Oh, poppet, to think when we met, you were so worried that you came from Iran.
What?
When we met.
As if I'd be worried about something like that.
I don't care where you're from.
Iran, France, doesn't bother me.
I'm very modern.
I'm not from Iran.
Well, you said something along those lines.
No, not Iran, a man.
I said I used to be a man!
You used to be a man?
Yes!
Oh, God!
Well, we have a very interesting talk lined up for today.
Our employee of the month, and computer expert, Jen Barber, has kindly agreed to say a few words about her role in the IT department.
Now, speaking as someone who doesn't know the difference between a laptop and, erm, the larger one, I'm certainly looking forward to hearing what she has to say.
Good morning.
When I was asked to give a speech about what it is I do and everything, I was very excited.
At last, I thought, a chance to explain the wonders of technology to ordinary folk.
But then I thought, "Who wants to listen to a boring old speech"?
Wouldn't it be better if I could actually bring one of these wonders in to show you it?
Say, oh, I don't know, the internet!
I think it would - and I have.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to present to you the internet!
No flash photography, you'll harm it.
Ladies and gentlemen Why's no-one laughing?
If anything were to happen to this box, the world as we know it would fall into chaos.
Planes would drop from the sky, like tables.
Society would tear itself apart like an angry child with a napkin.
Man's primeval instinct to survive at any cost, would lead to terrible violence, so, please, no flash photography.
I must say this is all very impressive, Douglas.
What exactly are you working on?
I dunno.
April, we need to talk.
Darling, couldn't we do this at home?
I was hoping we'd get shit-faced and watch telly.
There'll be no more getting shit-faced and watching telly.
There'll be no more Steven Seagal marathons, and there'll be no more paintballing weekends.
I'm afraid our adventure has come to an end.
What?
But But why?
It's not you, it's me.
No, actually it's not me, it is you.
I'm sorry.
You don't think of me as a woman, do you?
What?
Of course I do!
It bothers you that I used to be a man.
No, I love that you used to be a man.
It's your thing.
I love thinking about that operation that you had.
Oh, please, look at me.
I am a woman.
This is a woman in front of you.
Excuse me.
I am a woman!
You're tearing me apart.
Please, Douglas I'm sorry, it's beyond my control.
Please, Douglas, please!
Just go.
You're making this harder for me.
How could you do this?
How could you do this to me?
!
You bastard.
And that's what the flashing light's for.
Any more?
Is it heavy?
Is it heavy?
That's a bit of a silly question.
The internet doesn't weigh anything.
OK, guys, I guess I should wrap it up.
No, no.
I really have to finish up.
More!
More!
More!
More!
Guys!
Oh, my God, you really like me.
This really isn't that funny.
I know, it's terrible.
I thought at least we'd get a good story out it.
you know?
Something we'd remember.
It's over, April.
Oh, Jesus.
The internet!
Argh!
We're all gonna die!
SCREAMING AND SHOUTING Everybody, stay calm!
'He needs to hold his nerve 'He's done it!
' But it's not the same.
Oh, April.

1 What is Friendface?
Friendface is a great new site for meeting people.
How does it work?
Friendface works along the same principle as a cold or a terrible plague, but it's not disgusting germs that Friendface spreads, it's friendship.
Each Friendface page is like a Petri dish filled with friendship germs.
When you stick your face into the dish, you may come away with millions of people attached to your face!
That's right, it's basically a diseased face of friendship!
Just sign up with Friendface by giving us all of your personal information, and we'll provide a web page where you can meet new friends, catch up with old ones, and maybe find that special someone.
Don't think about germs now - that analogy's over.
Now it's just love and companionship, and everything's fine.
We own everything you put on Friendface-- it says so in the terms and agreements.
But don't worry, we won't use it to do anything bad, we promise.
Just think about love and companionship and everything's fine.
Friendface.
Friendface.
Friendface.
Can you two not use my email address any more, please?
I've got a new one.
Jennywenny@Friendface?
Oh, you've not signed up with Friendface, have you?
Yes, I have, actually.
Why not?
It's great.
I joined last night and I've already got 30 friends.
Baaaa!
Yes, let's all join Friendface and become part of the herd!
I don't think so.
Why not?
They're terrific!
You can catch up on old friends, you can flirt with people I think I've got better things to do than to talk to friends and flirt with people, thank you very much.
You can play Scrabble online with it It's just another way of shoving advertising in your face, Jen.
Don't do it, you'll regret it.
It might be a great way to meet women.
All the girls on 7 are on it.
- I'm in!
- What?
- I've joined.
- That was quick!
It was what you said about Scrabble.
I'm in a game now.
- I'm in!
- What?
- I've joined!
- What about the advertising?
Oh, advertising doesn't have any effect on me, Jen.
I tune it out.
So, the girls on 7, Kimberley, she's on this?
Uh-huh.
Oh, cool, look!
They've got this great little game on their home page.
You have to throw a little can of cola into a giant mouth.
That's brilliant.
God, I'm so thirsty.
Listen, I've got to have a word with you Hang on.
You know, Jen, you can change your settings on Friendface so you don't get that annoying bleep with every message.
Incoming message!
Sorry, that's me.
Yeah, I just have to tell you about Oh, hang on.
Open a chat window and we can talk in it.
How do I do that?
You just you press the speech bubble in the left corner.
Yes!
Oh, yeah, but don't forget, if - What are you like?
!
- If I might interject.
- That's hilarious!
- Oh, Moss!
That was a classic Moss line.
I love this.
I feel so social.
Jen, I'm going home now.
It's nearly 7:30.
I'm just answering all my Friendface messages.
They sort of piled up while we were chatting.
So many people I don't care about getting back in touch.
Oh, there's another one.
And I'm getting into online games-- you know, real brain-teasers.
And I'm filling out a form on how much I love Cuke.
Have you tried it?
Cuke?
Yeah!
I love Cuke.
It's heaven in a can.
Anyway, I'm going to head, all right?
Jen, don't get too obsessed by that.
No, I won't.
Bye, Moss.
Oh, someone's added me as their friend.
I went to school with her.
Wonder how she's doing?
Oh, not very well.
That's good.
- Incoming message!
- Jesus Christ!
I mean, Jesus Christ?
Oh, God.
Oh God, oh God, oh God.
Oh, God!
Excuse me, some of us are trying to sleep round here.
This woman that I went out with once, wants to meet up again.
I thought I'd got rid of her, but, oh no, she found me on Friendface.
Now I'll have to spend all afternoon trying to make up lies of how to get rid of her again.
Oh, I think that is very mean.
If it were me, I would like to know the truth.
What, that you wear way too much makeup?
I do not!
That's a horrible thing to say!
How dare you!
Not you, Jen.
This girl.
- Oh, does she?
- Big time.
- Did you sleep with her?
- No.
It wasn't my fault!
I got really drunk to try and make the evening pass quicker, and then by the end of it the makeup started to work for me.
- Oh, please!
- I'm not proud of it, Jen.
It's not going on my CV.
But every man has a story like this.
This is not the first story you've told me like this.
Every man has a few stories like this.
Oh, no, it's all coming back to me now.
She used to slap it on with a trowel.
God, why don't women have the confidence to know that less is more?
And then, when she started crying, it all ran down her face.
It was like breaking up with the Joker.
Hang on-- she was that upset, she was crying?
What?
No It sounds like you really hurt this girl's feelings.
The least you can do is tell her the truth.
Be a man, for God's sake.
Whoa, don't Hey, I am a man.
I will tell her.
I will email her.
No, you have to tell her face to face.
The hell I do.
This is a fragile young woman.
What if she reacts badly?
That's why I'm doing it on email.
No, you have to tell her the truth and you have to do it face to face.
Do I?
My mum's on Friendface!
My mum!
I have another channel of communication with my mum!
- Isn't that good?
- No, it is not good.
She's put down her current mood as "sensual".
Why did you accept her as a friend?
What are you, an animal?
I can't turn down a friend request from my mum.
- Message for me.
- Oh I am eating my apple, Mum!
She packed me an apple this morning and it's the issue of the day.
I have to go.
I'm meeting an old school friend for lunch.
Isn't it great the way Friendface brings people together?
Nanny's chasing the dog, all the kids are screaming, absolute bedlam, and here's me running out of the house to go to a meeting with the major shareholders.
- My life is an absolute nightmare.
- Yes Yes, mine too.
So, the other girls, what are they doing?
Elaine is head of marketing at Dennis Publishing.
- She's married to the editor of Esquire.
- Is she?
Veronica's an A and R with Arista.
Her big embarrassing story is she passed on Arctic Monkeys.
Idiot.
Jilly is an architect, designing a new wing on the Tate.
Jilly?
Jilly Spencer?
She used to eat the wood on her desk.
- I always thought she was slow.
- No, she's a genius.
- Wow.
Everybody's doing great.
- Yeah.
So, what about you, Jen?
What are you up to?
- What am I up to?
- Yeah.
Oh, God, I hope that's not a rude question.
No, no, no, no.
It'd be awful if I just listed all our successful friends and you were stuck in some terrible, dead-end job you hated.
God, yeah, that would be an absolute fucker.
No, no, I'm head of I at Reynholm Industries.
Ohh!
I didn't know you were interested in computers.
"Interested" is not the word.
Sorry.
Hi, babe.
You didn't have to call just to tell me that.
Aw.
No!
I can't, I'm in public.
Stop it!
Yeah, of course I'm wearing them.
I'll have another one, please.
- Hi, Roy.
- Hiya.
Roy, do you have any attractive, successful-looking friends?
No!
- What, none at all?
- No.
Oh, God.
Well, maybe you could help me, then.
Wow.
That's flattering.
- Are you pissed?
- A little bit.
Could you come to a school reunion with me and pretend you're my husband?
Do you really think that you can quiz me for a better option and think I'll still say yes?
- I'll give you Â£50.
- When is that?
Tomorrow night.
I sort of bigged myself up to this girl.
She never had much time for me in school and I wanted to impress her, - so I need a husband.
- Yeah, I can't because tomorrow night I'm spending the evening with the Joker.
I'm going to do what you said-- tell her I'm just not interested in her.
Ooh, you're not actually going to do that face to face?
You told me to!
Well, aren't you worried she'll go mad?
I'm very worried about that!
Oh, you Oh, you are a f Oh!
- I'm going to cancel.
- No, no, you can't cancel, not now.
- Who am I going to ask, then?
- Who are you going to ask what?
Nothing.
The queen of honesty here needs someone to pretend to be her husband at her school reunion.
When is it?
- So, you remember what to do?
- Big you up to the max.
- By?
- Listing your fictional achievements.
Uh-huh.
And?
Saying how lucky I am to have met you and talking about our sweet sex life.
Maybe not the last one.
We don't want to sound too smug.
Hey, if I'm pretending to be married, I'm pretending to be sexually active.
Don't worry, Jen, I plan on earning this Â£10.
Five now, five later.
OK.
And I will have a Bacardi and Cuke.
Thank you.
So, how are you?
I'm fine.
It was great seeing your profile pop up on Friendface-- gave me a great excuse to get back in touch.
Yeah That's the brilliant thing about that bloody website.
- And how are you?
- I'm great.
I am great.
Yeah, I'm glad that we got together, Alison, because, erm It's only fair that I be completely honest with you.
The truth is Do you mind if I say something first?
Er, OK.
I've never been very good with words, so I wrote it down and it turned into a poem.
I'm sorry, are you going to read a poem now?
Is that what's actually going to happen?
- Yeah, is that all right?
- Wouldn't you prefer to text it to me?
It's a bit long for that.
Okey-dokey.
"Oh, gentle Irish eyes tousled brown hair smile as big as my favourite teddy bear".
That's a bit corny-- I might take it out or I might leave it in.
"Without you I am just a husk".
Er erm A husk?
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
"Without you, I am just a husk, A dead thing.
My new best friend is a razor a rope, s noose to swing in.
Without you, the sweet release of death would be all that could give me hope.
When I see your face on my computer I don't just see you I see our future".
Oh, it's, er Ohhhhh which is how my sexy wife became the first ginger woman on the cover of Newsweek.
That is wow!
Just when I think I've heard every story that puts Jen in a good light, you come up with another one.
Yes, and they're beginning to sound a little bit unbelievable.
Oh, I can't help it.
I love this well-travelled high-earner.
A woman in the living room, a chef in the kitchen, a prostitute in the bedroom.
Ow!
Jen, why don't you tell them all about your bionic arm?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could do.
Or or we could talk about something else.
Yeah, we've heard enough stories about Jen.
We want to hear about the guy that tamed her heart.
Yeah.
What do you do, Moss?
I'm a professional tennis player.
He doesn't like talking about it, though, so I do.
- Where do you play?
- Where don't I play!
- Wimbledon?
- I don't play there.
- Are you seeded, Moss?
- Bit of a personal question, Terry.
But, yes, I'm highly seeded.
We have two lovely children, Zenith and Quasar.
I I love I love this song.
Let's all stop talking and dance to this song.
Come on.
Let's dance!
Her name is Jen.
Er, she's a work colleague.
We've been seeing each other for some time.
I love her.
I love that woman.
- Do you have a picture of her?
- A picture of her?
No.
What, not even on your phone?
No.
It never occurred to me to take a picture of her because I see her all the time.
You just don't want me!
I do, I do It's Why wouldn't I want you?
No, it's just it's this girl.
- There is no girl.
- There is!
It's a real girl.
Look, could you just stop crying?
No.
I'm never going to stop crying!
Do you want to meet her?
We can meet her.
- What, really?
- Yeah, let's go and meet Jen.
Will that make you a little less mad?
Tough, though, the whole marriage thing.
Terry, it's as tough as a cow's back.
But you know what takes the edge off for me?
What?
Regular, uninhibited, exploratory sex with a partner who's even wilder than I am.
Yup, that's Jen.
She may look like a ginger angel, but get her behind closed doors and she turns into Peter Stringfellow.
God, I envy you.
These days Delina hardly ever lets me, you know, do it.
Ah, I'm on Jen at least four times a day.
As I've already said, I am fully seeded.
You've got it really sorted out, haven't you?
Yeah.
It's very surprising, isn't it?
No offence, Jen, but I've got to admit I always thought you'd be the one whose life just went completely off the rails.
You always seemed to attract such chaos at school, but look at you now.
Delina, can we be best friends?
To tell you the truth, I think Delina might be sleeping with someone else.
No, she's just over there.
I mean, this is just between ourselves.
Of course.
There are little clues here and there, things only a husband would pick up.
Like, someone wrote a message on her Friendface wall, read: "Can't wait to shag your arse off again soon".
I don't know, maybe I'm reading too much into it.
Still, if I ever found out who that person was Agh!
It's a pickle, Terry.
Awh!
Women!
Agh!
If I had a pound for every bloody woman Arh!
I hear ya.
- Hi there, Jen.
- What are you doing here?
I saw on your profile that you were having a party.
That's the great thing about Friendface-- I get to see what all my employees are doing, all the time.
Come on, be game.
Ah, there she is.
There's Jen!
Jen, I will help you out, but I need you to play along with me.
This is Alison.
She's that friend I told you about.
And this, this is Jen, the woman I love.
What's going on here?
What are you doing here?
I'm enjoying an evening out with my woman.
What?
Jen, who is this joker?
No offence.
OK, what the hell is going on here?
Moss is my husband, Roy.
But you said you wanted me.
She really did.
It's true, I did want you.
At one point you were the one that I wanted.
But then you left.
You left, Roy.
And so I turned to Moss.
And Moss was there for me, Roy.
Moss was there for me in a way that you were not, and now we're together, and that's all that matters.
I don't know.
- What?
- I don't know, Jen.
I love you, God knows I do.
Your sweet abandon in bed, your humanitarian work, and you've given me two wonderful children in Zenith and Quasar.
But it sounds like you still have feelings for this young man, and I'm not sure I can handle that.
I'm not sure at all!
I don't.
I don't.
I don't have feelings for this man.
- Yes, you do!
- Oh Admit it, Jen!
Admit that you have feelings for me, loudly, here, in front of Alison.
No, I don't.
He means nothing to me, Delina.
Well, you moved on quickly, you bitch!
How dare you call my sexy wife a bitch!
- Do you want to take this outside?
- With pleasure, sir.
I will just get some of my coats.
Excuse me, Alison.
- What now?
- Hadn't really thought this far.
I'll just go and see how they are.
Oh, those bloody bastards!
Well, lovely to see Jen!
See her?
I'm shagging her.
Grrrr Well, hello there, beautiful.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Are you nearly finished, Roy?
Yep.
You're taking a long time.
It's a complicated problem.
There are a lot of Shabaranks in your hard drive.
I'm sure I can crack it eventually.
Arrgh, it's frustrating!
Come on, work, work!
Do you know anything about digital cameras?
Roy might.
I do, as it happens.
I'm an amateur photographer, actually.
I've just got this new one, but it's really complicated.
Oh.
That's fixed.
What was wrong with it?
It wasn't turned on.
Oh I don't know why I got rid of my old one, it was perfectly fine.
Yeah, well, these all look good.
What's going on with this fella?
Look at him!
He's pulling a mad face, he looks completely mental!
That's Dave, my brother.
He's got a very serious condition.
When I said mental there, I meant mental in the sense of intelligent.
You know, like he'she's a big reader.
He has boss-eyedness.
Boss-eyedness?
He's permanently boss-eyed.
That must be a big pain in the arse.
It is, and the terrible thing is, people think there's actually something funny about this.
No!
Who could think there's something funny about this?
It's a proper condition and hehe really suffers, he really Oh, hey.
I'd just give anything if Dave could have a normal life.
Oh, hey, now.
Kimberly, are you OK?
It's just Dave.
Oh, poor Dave.
Hey, I've got a great idea.
Why don't we all do something to raise money for people like Dave?
Yeah, we must be able to think of something, like a fun run!
That's a good idea.
Or a nude calendar.
That's maybe even a better idea than the fun run idea!
We could call it "The Girls of the Seventh Floor".
Yes!
Yes!
It's a very strong theme!
Roy could be the photographer.
I could do the photographs, because I said I was an amateur photographer!
Come on, let's do a brainstorm.
I'd like to be November if that's OK.
Can I be April?
Yes!
And on October, we've got to have a Halloween theme 'Boss-eyedness is something which affects 1% of Britons.
'It doesn't impair eyesight, 'and yet people with boss-eye are routinely discriminated against.
'Just like any form of discrimination, 'it should be stopped.
'But we can only do so with your help.
'That's right, we're looking at you.
' It's not funny, Jen.
It's a very serious condition!
I know it is, I know it is.
I'm sorry.
This is exactly the kind of discrimination that we are fighting against.
And what do you need from me?
I just need a little time off work.
We're trying to raise some money for the boss-eyed.
Oh, who?
Who is?
Just me and some people.
Oh, yeah?
Who?
Some people from upstairs.
You wouldn't know them.
What are you going to do?
Hi.
Hi.
Hiya.
What are you talking about?
Oh, nothing, I'm just talking to Jen about a private project.
What is it?
It's just ajust a private project I'm doing that's private.
What is it?
It's just a thing!
It's a just big bloody pain in the arse thing that I might do.
Oh, you are being modest.
It's a very kind thing you're doing, very generous, very charitable.
I really am impressed, you know, good for you.
What's he done, persuaded all the girls on seven to do a nude calendar for charity?
Bye!
Bye, Moss!
Oh, God, he's right.
Oh, how the hell?
No, no Oh, he made it sound sleazy!
It is sleazy.
Oh, what kind of man would want to photograph a bunch of beautiful women without any clothes on, Roy?
The kind of man who wants to help people, Jen!
No, I don't like it.
I find it very offensive.
No, it's going to be tasteful.
No, it's not.
You're right, it's not!
It's going to be rude, it's going to be sexy!
All the things men like, and it'll make a million quid for that charity.
No, no, no, absolutely not.
Why not?
Taking your clothes off, if it's unemployed men or old ladies from Yorkshire, it's fun.
If it's sexy women, it's not fun - it's oppression.
No, I will not give you time off for this!
Well, OK, I will do it in my own time.
Oh, Roy, you're behaving like a horny teenager.
No, you are.
For God's sake, try and have some dignity.
No, I won't, I won't.
Sit down.
I'm not going to.
Have an adult conversation I'm going to do it.
And it's for charity, and there's nothing you can do about it!
You're embarrassing yourself!
Roy, stop it!
Come back here, Roy!
Don't be silly!
Come back!
Roy!
Thank you.
I'm really pleased we've had this conversation.
Thanks for seeing us.
Any advice you want about anything, come and see me Hiya.
Roy, thank God you're here.
Jen's just been telling us how the calendar would have been sexist.
Oh, has she?
It would be much better if we used old ladies or unemployed men in it.
Oh, good.
She thinks we'll make a lot more money because of the "aah factor".
The "aah factor"?
Yeah, the "aah factor".
The thing that makes you go "aah" when you hear about it.
Ah, yeah, but will anyone actually want to see old women or destitute men with no clothes on?
Won't that just make people go "aargh", rather than "aah"?
Guys, I've got a great idea.
Why don't we all ask our grans to do the calendar?
That's a great idea!
Oh, Nadine, you are just so full of ideas!
But can I, hold on one second, what's our theme?
Isn't our theme "Girls of the Seventh Floor"?
That was a very strong theme.
Yes, Roy, but now the theme can be "Grans of the Girls of the Seventh Floor".
Oh, yeahI don't want to take photos of grannies.
This could do very well, Roy.
This could be tasteful, like the one Helen Mirren did.
Old ladies pot plants covering their bits, you know.
An erotic calendar the whole family could enjoy.
Roy, you can't drop out now.
Douglas has already paid for the studio time.
What?
Has he?
Yeah, he's really very interested in this project.
I just have to say how I'm finding this whole thing just so moving, how so many men have come up to me and shown interest and support for the calendar.
I mean, people really do care about the boss-eyeds.
You can't drop out now!
I wasn't wrong about you, was I, Roy?
I thought you were special.
I am, I'm so special.
Ino Ilet's do it, let's go round up those grans!
Thank you!
Oh, thank you!
That's OK.
Hi.
Hi.
You don't have to do this.
We could just get a proper photographer.
Oh, no, I'm happy to do it.
How's it going?
Not a great start, I have to say.
Of all the girls on seven, only nine have grans that are still alive.
Of that nine, one is having a hip replacement on the day of the shoot.
One is a little senile, and may not know what's happening.
And the last one, the last one has a gangrenous arm, but she still wants to do it.
So all I have to do now is hit the streets and find six old women I've never met who would be happy to take all of their clothes off and let me take photographs of them.
Why are you doing this?
Same reason I do everything, Jen - to have sex with a lady.
Ahh.
What?
!
I saiddo you want to be in a nude calendar?
Do I want a calendar?
!
No, no, no.
Doyouwantto do a nude calendar for charity?
Oh, for charity.
Oh, well, in that case, yes, I'll take it.
How much is it?
No, no, no, no, no.
Do you want to do a calendar?
But the doctor's already changed my catheter.
No, no, no.
I need you to take all your clothes off and have me take photographs of you!
Oh, you remembered your old mum's birthday.
TELEPHONE RINGS IT.
Jen, hi.
I wanted you to know if this calendar doesn't make Â£1 million, I'm holding you personally responsible.
What?
!
That's not very fair.
I'm sad to say that the only secure route to a knighthood in this sorry age is via charity work.
You can't do that, Mr Reynholm.
It wasn't my idea.
Nonetheless, the idea came from your department and, as head of the department, it's your nuts on the block.
Oh, Mr Reynholm, I Don't worry, Jen.
Just make it as sexy as hell and watch the money poor in.
Sexy, sexy, sexy.
Every page sexier than the last.
Mr Reynholm DIAL TONE Oh, grans!
Grans aren't sexy.
That's not gonna make any money!
What kind of society are we living in?
What?
Apparently, we are living in the kind of society that sees a man who just wants to take naked photos of some old ladies as some sort of weirdo, who deserves to be chased and shouted at and beaten and chased!
Did you tell them it was for the boss-eyeds?
Oh, I did, I did.
I did tell them and you know what happened?
They just laughed at me.
What?
!
They just laughed at me, Jen.
They don't care about the boss-eyeds!
Wait, Roy.
You know what?
Maybe we should rethink the theme a little bit.
"Grans of the girls of the seventh floor" is such a mouthful.
Why not just bring it back to "Girls of the seventh floor"?
You said it was sexist!
Oh, bleurgh.
It's empowering!
Sexist?
How dare you be so patronising.
Oh, no!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
And you'd enjoy it, Roy!
You'd love to take those photos, wouldn't you?
You'd enjoy taking them, I bet you would.
You'd enjoy that a lot more!
Do you know what I'm talking about, eh, eh, eh, eh?
!
I don't know, Jen.
Oh, come on!
No, no.
You know, I don't think that Kimberly would like it.
I don't wanna make any wrong moves there.
I cannot blow this one!
Kimberly is the best thing that's ever happened to me and she hasn't really happened to me yet.
We are not gonna make any money with grannies.
Well, er I'm back!
What, what do you mean?
I'm back from holiday.
You were on holiday?
!
Yes, I was on holiday.
Oh, that's right.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
You didn't know I was on holiday?
No, no, we did.
Where did you go?
You didn't know I was on holiday!
Oh, we did, we did.
We missed you.
I've been gone a week!
A week?
!
Wow!
Mm What?
You know what's very in now?
I don't.
Geeks.
You lot.
The whole nerd thing.
Geek chic.
It's very in.
So?
So it's a calendar that celebrates scientific achievement.
That's right.
About time!
Think of it as an opportunity to re-enact all of your favourite moments from the history of science.
And maths?
And maths.
Yes!
TELEPHONE RINGS Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
..
Yep?
OK, are they all there?
Yep.
Yeah, so you've rounded up all your best looking friends?
Yep.
OK, great, Roy, OK.
Remember, it's got to be sexy.
Sexy, sexy!
Yep.
OK, so, if the rest of you want to take lunch ..
I'll do Moss first.
Laters.
So I'll hold up the beaker like, "Ah!
I've discovered something".
Exactly.
Yes.
But what have I discovered?
It doesn't matter.
I think it does a bit, actually.
UmOK.
You have discovered nuclear bombs.
In a beaker?
!
You're right, it's surprising, so give me surprised.
Yeah, that's it, and it's, it's confusing.
Yes, you're confused, and you are afraid of the consequences of the discovery.
Give me fear, fear!
Yeah!
That's it!
That's good.
OK, nice, nice.
And if if you're hot or anything, Moss, maybe you could undo some buttons on your shirt.
No, I'm all right, thanks, Roy.
Maybe just undo your top button.
Why?
It's hot, it's a hot lab, because of all the fusion.
Fission!
Fission, yeah.
That's it.
Maybe just one more button.
OK, that's good.
And maybe you could, ermaybe you could get down on all fours.
Why?
Because you had some microscopic nuclear things and you dropped them.
Oh, right.
Big klutz.
Oh, oh, nightmare!
Yeah, they're down there somewhere.
Oh, it's a pain.
Where are they?
Yeah, you're getting angry.
Oh, well, I would!
Yes, because you can't find them.
Oh, grr!
You growl when you can't find stuff!
Grrr!
That's it!
And there are other people in the lab and they're being so noisy.
OK.
Shh!
That's it.
A bit less of Yes.
And then it occurs to you that maybe you put your microscopic nuclear things in your back pocket.
Oh, did I?
Oh, no.
Oh, that's a pain.
Why would they be there?
And yet I've put them there.
Oh, it's strange.
Yeah.
You're working hard, you know, you're tired.
Oh, well, I've been busy.
And they're being noisy again!
Shh, shh!
That's good, Moss.
Yeah Shh!
OK, so just give me a a cheeky, sort of, I've been a naughty boy look.
But I've just solved Fermat's theorem.
Yes, but you've solved it in a way that the stuffed shirts of the time would have found very naughty.
Am I Fermat?
Because If I am, these clothes are wrong.
It's, it's, you're more, you're you're a naughty mathematician.
Roy, you you're doing it wrong.
The lighting is all wrong.
The pictures will be very gloomy.
This whole set-up is inadequate.
It's a celebration.
You've just discovered penicillin.
But why are our tops off?
I always take my top off when I'm celebrating, don't you?
Well, yes, yes, of course, yeah.
OK Cavort!
That's it, yeah.
Yeah!
Oh!
Thank god for all that penicillin!
Touch each other in a celebratory way.
Yeah, that's it!
Yeah!
Yes!
That's good.
That's it.
Ruffle your hair now.
That's good, OK, nice, nice.
That's it.
A little bit, a bit more shoulder like that.
You, pick him up like a wheelbarrow and then walk around and then you come in this way, OK?
'..
any form of discrimination should be stopped.
'But we can only do so with your help.
'That's right, we're looking at you.
' Thank you.
I just wanted to say a few words.
Hey, come on, we did it.
This is exciting, isn't it?
Reynholm Industries' first sexy new charity calendar.
Come on, Goofy, we want to see the calendar.
I can't wait.
I hereby announce that speech over and the calendar ready to go.
Yeah!
I think I speak for all men when I say I can't wait to get that box open and feast my eyes upon its sexy contents!
Oh, yeah!
Whoa!
Someone's played an awful prank!
There's nothing here but gloomy pictures of morons.
No, not morons - geeks.
They're sexy now.
You know, geek chic.
Geek chic?
!
I wanna tear my eyes out!
This is horrible.
Horrible!
This is your fault.
It was Roy's idea.
You idiot!
I wouldn't buy this and it's in aid of me!
I didn't do it.
I'm talking to her!
It's hard to tell with your mad eyes.
Sorry we're late.
Here are the calendars, brilliant!
Oh, great, we're on a calendar!
Box fresh.
There goes the entire audience for our calendar ..
and they got it for free!
Roy, I don't care that no-one liked the calendar.
That was the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me.
Really?
Really.
'The doctor's already changed my catheter.
' Roy, what's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
Er, no, I'm Don't let me stop the kissing!
Let's 'Shh.
' Roy, are you OK?
Mm-hm, I'm just tired.
Lips.
Oh 'Cavort!
' 'You're doing it wrong.
Cavort!
You're doing it wrong.
' 'The doctor's already changed my catheter.
' 'Cavort!
' Agh!
Roy, what is it?
Kimberly ..
