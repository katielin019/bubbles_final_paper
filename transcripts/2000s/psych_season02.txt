{START OF EPISODE 1}
What's with the Michael Jackson outfit?
That's, like, two years old.
I got scared.
You were supposed to be Billy Ocean.
Why would Michael Jackson sing with Roland Orzabal?
Why would Billy Ocean sing with Roland Orzabal?
'Cause he's awesome.
Now we gotta add the moonwalk into Shout and hope the judges don't slam us for it.
I don't know how to moonwalk.
You better learn quick.
Shawn Spencer and Mr. Burton Guster.
Let's give 'em a nice round of applause.
# She'll be # # Comin' around the mountain # # When she comes # # She'll be comin' around # # the mountain # # When she comes # # She'll be comin' around # # the mountain # # She'll be comin' around # # the mountain # # She'll be comin' around # # the mountain # # When she comes # # Ave Maria # You're stiff.
Inarticulate.
Slightly jaundiced.
Asymmetrical.
You smell.
The one on the right there's something in your teeth.
All in all, I'd say there's absolutely nothing worthwhile about either one of you.
But we haven't even sang yet.
Apples and oranges.
Anybody else?
I like 'em.
Well, of course you liked them.
You've been asleep for the last 45 minutes.
Zapato?
Well, I Good.
Moving on.
Coming up after the break You see what I mean?
Shh!
You shooshing me for reality TV?
Dude Zip!
I'm Lester Beacon and this is American Duos.
# American Duos # Rule number one, Shawn no talking during Duos.
Oh, for the love of Lori Loughlin.
Please use the pause button just once.
Why did we get TiVo if we never fast-forward and I can't stop for commentary?
Whoa, no calls either.
Gus, don't be a rabid porcupine.
This is just another knockoff of the other knockoff of the original knockoff of that other show.
# And welcome back # # to American Duos.
# First of all, Shawn, look at the guy on the right.
# American Duos # Zapato?
He's not black.
He's Latino.
That's different.
The contestants in this one are duos, which makes it way more compelling.
They have to mesh, become one soul.
Like V'ger and Stephen Collins in Star Trek I. And they're shooting in Santa Barbara this year, which more than compensates.
Don't you dare answer that.
Dude, it's Jules.
She could be bleeding and in a ditch.
She's not bleeding.
She could be in a ditch.
She's not in a ditch.
She could be lonely and in the shower.
She has a shower phone?
I certainly hope so.
Dude, it's a win-win except for the ditch one.
Hello?
Nothing at all.
We'll be right there.
Shawn!
That's it.
I'm canceling the TiVo.
No more frame-by-frame.
No more Ghost Cat.
I recorded that by accident.
Then why didn't you erase it for three months?
Fine, but I'm putting up the official Burton Guster spoiler alert.
Until I get back and watch the recording, nobody utters a word about American Duos.
That's going to be difficult.
Why?
That's Nigel St. Nigel.
You know, you were totally unfair to Catherine Clement in season two.
I don't remember the person to whom you are referring.
But she was hideous.
This is them?
Yes, this is Shawn Spencer and Burton Guster our resident psychic team.
The answer is no.
Mr. St. Nigel, this is exactly what you asked for.
Hear them out.
There's no reason.
Hear them out.
Nigel needs protection.
Do you realize you're in a police station?
I don't trust the police.
They're useless.
No offense.
Oh, none taken.
Mr. St. Nigel has been the victim of a series of attempts and threats on his life by a crazed stalker.
He believes that even the police could somehow be in on the conspiracy even though we've assured him that I can speak for myself.
And stop slouching.
Every time I bring in some sort of professional protection my attacker gets closer.
My car has been tampered with.
My trailer has been broken into.
Accidents follow me everywhere.
What I need is someone who can anticipate my attacker's next move.
Someone who can move about undetected.
You're talking about a psychic.
Someone who can see danger before it occurs.
Someone who can say, "Nigel, duck"!
before the bullet exits the chamber.
Spare me the theatrics.
Can you do it or not?
Look, we are asking you to go undercover.
No one outside of this office will know that you're on the job.
What about Detective Lassiter?
Absolutely not.
His hair looks like it's been poured out of a cake mold.
Nigel, get ready to feel safe.
Jules, I need complete access to the theater.
Green rooms, air shafts, spokesmodels Whoa, whoa, slow down.
We need to think this through.
Come up with a plan.
You'll need to blend.
Obviously the local police already know you so a false identity I already have a plan.
You have a plan?
What is it?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you wanted us to be stealth.
Bring on the next contestants.
Presenting Shawn Spence Starr and Gus TT Showbizz.
Good luck, guys.
Hello.
So, what do you two hope to get out of the competition?
Just hope to be here long enough to do something awesome.
Well, you know, round one is the most Why don't you just go ahead?
Warm up.
# I keep # # Tonight # # I keep # # Tonight # You're warm.
You're red hot.
# Talking away # # I don't know wha - # # What to say # # I'll say it anyway # # Slowly learn # # that life is okay # # Wrong verse.
# # I'll be coming # # for your love okay # # Take on me # # Take on me # # Take me on # # Take on me # # I'll be gone # # In a dream # Really?
Well that was, um something.
Something awesome.
Honestly, guys.
Bad news.
I mean, this is gonna hurt Although I do love your style because you both chose to wear purple.
But I think we need to be fort forth ford forthright in saying that That we cannot even begin to understand how brilliant that was.
What are you are you crazy?
It was real.
It was rough.
Post-post-postmodern, yet challenging.
Sandpaper-esque.
They weren't even singing the same verse.
I'm voting no.
I'm voting yes.
Well, it's up to Zapato.
He votes yes.
He hasn't even spoken.
He doesn't need to.
Zapato?
Votes yes.
Come on!
Jam a cork in it, Lester.
We're moving on.
Oh Nigel, we all saw what happened with the Indian kid on that other show and Next!
Look out!
Ahem sweet!
See you guys in round two.
# I know you know # # That I'm not telling # # the truth # # I know you know # # They just don't have # # any proof # # Where's the deception?
# # Learn how to bend # # Your worst inhibitions # # Tend to psych you out # # in the end # Lester, this is ludicrous!
I almost died again!
Oh, it was an accident!
Any fool could see that.
We've had too many costly delays already.
You're paranoid, Nigel!
That thing could've almost landed on any one of us.
But it didn't, Lester.
It landed on me!
You daft punk!
Have you guys gone completely insane?
No.
What was that?
Us advancing to the next round.
You got half the words wrong!
Jules, those A-ha guys are Norwegian.
They didn't even know what they were singing.
What are you planning on singing for round two?
Yankee Rose, David Lee Roth.
What?
Too obvious?
No Gus can sing the guitar part.
Guys, if you're gonna stay in this competition, you're gonna need to step it up way up.
Now, I have to go.
I can't be seen talking to you.
And not just because you're undercover.
Well, Nigel's essentially a monster.
He's an equal-opportunity bastard.
The list of suspects can be narrowed down to everybody.
Even I kind of want to kill him.
So where does that leave us?
Well, there have been at least nine incidents that can be counted as attempts on his life in nine different cities.
We have to assume it's someone who's here every week.
Great.
No, not great.
That only narrows it down to crew, security, and fans.
Most of which are pretty die-hard.
We're gonna have to talk to everybody, which is gonna be difficult, because I think I'm developing a polyp.
# Eee-e # # Ah-a-ah # I'm Shawn Spence Starr.
This is my partner, Gus TT Showbizz.
The extra T is for extra talent.
We just advanced to the second round.
Congratulations!
Bevin.
Bevin Rennie Llywellen.
I'm next, I think.
I think you got us beat with that name already.
Where's your partner?
I got rid of him.
I sing both parts.
The show's called American Duos.
It's my hook.
Everyone needs a thing, right?
I learned that last year.
Good luck, dudes.
He did it.
Him?
You talk to one dude and you're done?
His name is Bevin Rennie Llywellen.
We made it!
Hey, you fellow winners!
Chance Cade.
This here's my brother Rance.
We just made it to the next round too.
Rance nice.
Nigel just called us a curious cocktail of inbreeding and type 2 diabetes.
But then he passed us through anyway.
That's hitting below the belt.
Yeah, well Australian people are mean.
Let's go.
I was wrong, they did it.
Shawn.
The stalker could've accessed the fallen light from up here.
He sure could've.
You supposed to be up here?
Define "supposed to be.
" How do you expect me to carry you two howler monkeys through tomorrow?
Well, I might've been a little pitchy.
I had a dairy-heavy Jamba Juice.
Stop the excuses.
Step it up!
I cannot carry you through another round.
I think I preferred the stalker.
Don't.
Don't what?
Uh smoke.
Those things'll kill you.
Well, add them to the list.
Stop!
I do not have physical contact with people with arm hair!
That case Was a gift from Les McKeown of the Bay City Rollers.
It's a very expensive bla How many do we got, officer?
A lot you're sure that you wanted everybody who was in the building?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
Everybody inside, everybody outside.
It's attempted murder.
I'm not screwing around here.
Okay, but Just stop talking and open the door, please.
Really, McNab, you might want to open your ears for once.
You could learn Go get me some coffee.
Great.
What are you two doing down at that competion?
We're looking for our big break.
Do I get a phone call?
No, I am trying to conduct an investigation.
Out!
Don't you want to ask us if we did it?
Ask him.
I plead the Fifth.
What's happening, undercover partner?
No public discussion of your undercover business.
We need a choreographer.
You need a choreographer.
You both have many needs, so So I'm getting a very strong vibration that you can dance.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Well, I did go to cheerleader camp.
For two weeks.
I got kicked out.
Kicked out?
Yeah, it's a long story.
Suffice to say I don't like liars who steal nail polish and then pass out when you slap 'em a little bit on the back of the head.
Jules, listen I can feel in my heart that you can get into the groove.
Now, we need to step it up, literally.
And we need to stomp the yard figuratively.
We've advanced to round two.
This is an elite class of performer.
Shawn, 97 teams have advanced to round two.
We're out of time.
You're all we've got.
Everything's riding on this!
Step up to the plate!
Guys.
Sit.
Okay, look the only time I have ever danced publicly was in a high school performance of Everybody Hip-Hop!
which closed after two performances.
Jules, all we do is argue.
Gus is very stubborn.
We need a guiding force.
A Svengali, if you will.
Shawn, I'm a detective, not a Svengali.
Jules Shawn, I think I would know if I were a Svengali.
Fine.
Whatever.
I guess my heart vibes are jammed.
Never mind.
Wait.
So what exactly do you do on the show, Zappito?
Zapato.
It's immaterial.
I'm a judge.
What kind of judge?
A talent judge on camera.
Sit on the far left.
Really?
Have you seen the show?
Yeah, a hundred times.
I'm sure I would've remembered you.
I can't believe this.
I was the first person hired for the show.
My first record went gold.
# Mira me # Well, you are spinning yourself into circles, whoever you are.
Maybe you should go outside and rethink your story.
What story?
Exactly.
Get him out of here.
Keep an eye on that one.
Who's next?
Yeah, great, the Bride of Frankenstein.
Have a seat.
What am I doing here?
Well, let's see.
Your trailer's right next to Nigel's.
You hate him.
And you can't seem to account for your whereabouts for most of the last 60 days.
Everybody hates Nigel.
And Everybody Loves Raymond.
But everybody doesn't have a vacant sense of morality and an assault with a deadly weapon charge on their record.
That was a publicity stunt.
The "weapon" was a forklift and I was drunk on a spray bottle of Charlie.
Well, I'm gonna need some answers, and fast.
Otherwise you and I are gonna turn on the hot lights, do the "Lindsay Hop" and see who cracks first.
Now you're trying to seduce me.
I never thought I would make this sound in my lifetime, but ew.
You left me alone half the day.
You were at a police station.
You'll never make it as bodyguards.
We're not bodyguards.
You'll never make it as anything.
Oh, thank God!
I'm starving.
What do you got there?
My standing order.
Wait!
Give it back!
No.
Give it back!
No.
What is it with you and throwing things?
Don't eat that!
Why the devil not?
'Cause I'm getting a very strong feeling about this sandwich.
It's Delicious?
No.
Herb-crusted?
No!
It's not from the hotel kitchen.
And?
And it's poisoned.
Well, it stings, but it looks like Spencer was right.
According to the toxicology reports, there's enough drugs to kill a Clydesdale in that tuna Nicoise salad sandwich.
You see, your hotel detail couldn't even manage one room.
Well, pardon me, but I'm not the one out ordering room service with a big target painted on my back.
It was a standing order!
We're almost through with the screen of your room, Mr. St. Nigel.
You can return when we clear it.
Fantastic, because to be honest, Gus and I have slightly more pressing issues at the moment.
We need to rehearse.
How did you know that sandwich didn't come from the kitchen?
Easy, there were only 83 sesame seeds on his bun.
All the other ones from the hotel have 87.
Are you serious?
No.
The other ones have swords.
Nigel's had a tooth pick.
I'm not Rain Man, Gus.
You sing like Rain Man.
Spencer!
You missed something we found prints.
Was he in a little red corvette?
Under the cherry moon?
Fingerprints!
They belong to Emilina Saffron.
So do the drugs we found in the food.
Cross-referenced them with her prescriptions and her medical records.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get a warrant.
Emilina?
Where am I?
Hello?
Hey, I need my bag!
Mr. Bean.
Thank God it's you.
I really need my bag, please.
And I need a confession.
I have a kid in Milwaukee.
The father's Samoan.
Can I now please have my bag, Tony Randall?
I was thinking something more along the lines of "I tried to kill Nigel St. Nigel "by poisoning his tuna Nicoise salad sandwich "with a dangerous cocktail of prescription medications I happen to carry with me at all times.
" Unquote.
I have no idea what you just said.
You're an even worse liar than my ex-wife.
Ex-wife?
Well, I mean, we're separated.
So what you're trying to tell me is that you got a little hole in your heart?
Come on.
Fill it with Saffron.
Okay you know, I'm gonna go get a bite.
And, uh, you think long and hard about what you did.
And I'll come back, say, sometime tomorrow afternoon.
I need my bag!
Oh, I know.
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of it.
No, I need my bag now!
I don't know, Detective.
Oh, come on.
Please don't tell me you're buying this dog and pony show.
It's an act.
It's the perfect cover-up.
Well, it's pretty convincing.
Oh, she's good.
But I'm better.
I'm gonna crack her like a bad back.
Please don't.
Mr. Bean, I need my bag.
# Shout, shout # # Let it all out # # These are the things # # I can do without # # Come on # # I'm talking to you # # Come on # # Shout, shout # Damn, girl!
It's okay, Jules.
You can be straight with us.
We can handle it.
Really?
'Cause that was awful.
Awful?
Can I teach you how to krump?
Maybe.
That's up to you.
But I can't reach inside of you and make you want this.
I mean, absolutely need this.
The way that both Hall and Oates used to need it.
Well, Oates a little bit more, probably.
This has to come from inside here.
And deep, deep, deep inside here.
Jules.
You do realize that there is a suspect in custody and the case is just about closed.
Is that what this laissez-faire, half-baked effort is about, huh the case?
I thought you were in it to win it!
Jules, are you feeling okay?
Sharp as cheddar.
You know, I wouldn't put all my eggs in Emilina's basket, Shawn.
She's barely lucid enough to form word endings, much less plan a series of attacks on Nigel's life.
She could be like Keyser Soze.
With one shoe.
I think until we get a confession, we gotta keep our eyes on the prize.
Now let's take it back to the broken melting robot, huh?
Gus watch me!
# She'll be coming # Instant noodles, Danish, Diet Coke.
Took you long enough.
I assumed that you were dead.
You see what I'm reduced to?
I can't even eat real food.
I'll take the noodles if you don't want them.
# She'll be coming around # # The mountain # # Coming 'round the mountain # # Around the mountain # # When she comes # # She'll be drivin' # Oh, bugger off, you silly giraffe.
Is something burning in here?
What is that?
You all right?
Peachy.
Now let me go.
Are we there yet?
I feel like I've been incarcerated in a blueberry.
Shawn.
This car makes me want to weep and then die.
Shawn!
Nigel?
You asked for a safe house where absolutely no one can find you.
That means we have to venture off the beaten path just a little.
Relax.
Good Lord!
Who lives here?
The Boringtons?
There's a better-than-decent chance this goes poorly.
I don't care.
I'm starving.
Wait!
Hey, I remember something!
Hurry up, I'm lucid.
I'm not kidding.
Come in here right now and bring my bag.
Hello?
Come on!
Come on, Count Chocula!
I know you're in there!
Don't make me pee on something.
Again!
Well, it took you long enough, I'm dying in here.
Yeah, it's called with drawal.
Are you ready to confess?
No, see, that's the thing.
First of all, I remember somebody getting into my purse yesterday.
When?
I don't remember, but I was sleeping, and they were diggin' around in my purse right in front of me.
Well, who was it?
I can't be sure.
I thought I was dreaming.
But it might've been a werewolf.
Might've been?
Yes, and another thing I wasn't even at the hotel this morning!
I slept on a car in the parking lot.
That makes me innocent.
You slept on a car?
Well, yeah.
It it's a long story.
I usually sleep in the lifeguard station, but I didn't want to make a scene, so Your fingerprints are all over Nigel's room.
We hook up sometimes.
I went to his room yesterday to see if he was lonely.
It was a moment of weakness.
A girl's got needs.
All right, gentlemen.
Prepare to taste the most succulent, evenly-marinated beef that you have ev Is that my robe?
It is indeed, Horace.
And it is comforting me at an elite spa level.
I think I should also point out that I'm absolutely famished and thoses filets actually smell promising.
Sweet.
That's what I'm talking about.
It's Henry.
They're rib eyes.
Is there a problem?
Well, look at it.
It's still got the marks where the jockey was hitting it.
You're free.
Parking lot attendants confirmed your alibi.
So I can go?
The sooner the better.
And for God's sakes, take a shower.
I'll never forget you.
What was your name again?
Nose hair trimmer.
Invest.
Can you even remember what it felt like to be able to move the muscles in your face?
Who decorated this place?
Kris Kristofferson?
Is that damn!
I built that table.
Really?
I'm pretty sure if I were to build a table, I would start by using wood that had never drifted.
All right, you know That's it.
Already?
I'm just getting started.
I've got a sonnet for each piece of fish paraphernalia.
Oh, yeah?
Well I got an ice-cold can of whip-ass just sitting in that fridge!
Actually, that's diet whip-ass.
Yeah!
You must be out of your damn mind!
Dude, you have three full cobs!
I will slap you, Shawn.
Now, tell me are you absolutely certain that this cow shoulder on my plate is in fact dead?
I'm just asking.
That's it, take off the robe!
Wearing that robe is a privilege and you, pal, have just lost it!
I stead fastly refuse.
This is the plushiest, most opulent robe I've ever had the pleasure of wearing.
Well, there's one thing we could agree on.
Now give it up.
No.
I feel like an angel baby swaddled in a cocoon of cloud candy.
You either take it off, or I'll take it off for you.
Dad, I don't think you're thinking this through.
Shawn!
Dad, I'm pretty sure he's going commando under Keep playin', Shawn.
Go ahead.
What kind of sick bastard goes commando underneath another man's robe?
All right, all right.
All right!
Come with me.
Come with me!
Come on!
Dad, just walk it off.
He's not staying here.
He violated basic robe code.
Robe code violation check.
Look, Shawn, there's a reason this guy's on the run.
He's been here ten minutes, even I want to kill him!
That's the problem, Dad.
How do I protect him from everybody?
You've already got a suspect in jail.
She was just released.
Now we have a plethora of suspects and no way to narrow them down.
- It's easy, tighten your focus.
Who does he victimize the most?
Is that peach cobbler in the fridge for everybody?
I'm sorry.
Not today.
I don't think so.
I showed him!
It'll all go away.
You think it's funny?
Nigel!
Naughty!
I hope you have some food in there.
Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster, I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news.
Emilina Saffron was found in the bathroom of her hotel suite this morning.
She was clinging to life and has been rushed to St. Thomas of the Apostles.
And so far all signs point to an overdose of some sort.
But we are fully investigating the matter.
Overdose?
She injected herself with enough tranquilizers to kill an adult rhinoceros.
But how did she escape?
Mr. St. Nigel, Ms. Saffron was released this morning after her alibi checked out.
She is the last person that you should be worried about now.
We have to cancel the show.
Are you kidding?
Look, I don't want to seem insensitive, but this is the third time this season she's been in the ICU.
Not like this.
I will not go on.
I'll be a sitting duck out there.
I will personally oversee your security detail, Mr. St. Nigel.
We'll all be out there together.
You'll be just fine.
Suck it up.
Now I gotta bolt.
I'm way late for my Pilates.
Lester Beacon sure didn't seem too broken up about Emilina.
He sure didn't.
Plus, his hair.
Shawn, we're in a hallway staying close to the wall doesn't make us invisible.
Agree to disagree.
You have a plan yet?
Gus, I'm a lyrical gangster.
I'll use some colorful vernacular and if necessary, you'll engage in fisticuffs.
That was close.
Too close.
No guard.
We did all that sneaking around because you thought they put a guard at Emilina's empty hotel room?
Seemed like a decent theory at the time.
You better have the key.
What are we looking for?
Beats me.
Damn.
Seems clean.
That's what you get for drinking whole milk, Shawn.
Dude, I have bones like granite.
And we just got ourselves a clue.
What is it?
I don't know.
Reach in there and fish it out.
I'm not putting my hand in there.
You do it.
Gus, I found it.
You get it.
That's how it works.
I'm not putting my hand in Emilina Saffron's toilet water, Shawn.
Jules!
I'm getting some really serious vibrations here.
They're coming from Emilina's hotel room.
You gotta get us in there as soon as possible.
Oh, and, uh Bring gloves.
Oh, my God!
It's just as I imagined.
Oh, I am feeling something in here.
Right here?
Did you bring the gloves?
Yeah, I brought the gloves.
Why do I need gloves?
I feel a sparkle.
That!
Wow, Shawn, that's amazing.
How did you know that?
I feel things deeply.
Yeah.
I need to speak with Emilina right away.
She's mostly comatose, Shawn.
We probably won't know the difference.
All right.
Dude!
That crystal was on the - I know!
Go back to the office, see if you can get some info on him.
Right.
Knock, knock!
You have a visitor.
What is Spencer doing here?
Look, I insisted.
Emilina's my favorite judge.
I used to have such a crush on her in high school.
You know, before she started eating glue and what not.
Has she said anything?
No.
Not yet.
But I will be right here when she does.
I can tell you that.
That's very gentle.
I mis judged her.
She was innocent.
Crying out for help in her own sad, potentially disease-ridden way.
I cut her off at the arms.
Judged the book by its filthy, loathsome wickedly erotic cover.
Look at me!
I'm here, baby.
Look at me!
I think she's trying to tell us something.
That someone's looking at her?
I was looking at her.
I should take this.
Get ready to be happy, Shawn.
Did you find him?
I didn't just find him.
I found him, found him, found him, and found him.
I knew this dude looked familiar.
He's been at every stage of the competion, in every city, doing his best William Hung at every stop.
Okay, let's try that again, and leave out the reference you know means nothing to me.
He's singing badly on purpose, Shawn, knowing full well he wouldn't advance.
That way he could re-enter the competition in every city at every stop.
That's nefarious.
But he couldn't have done this on his own.
Now we just have to figure out who's helping him from the inside.
Emilina just said, "Look at me" from her hospital bed.
How does that help us?
Dude Look at me!
Wait!
Ten-year-old Bevin Rennie Llywellen?
What the Oh, my God!
What?
What?
We have a match?
# There's a yellow rose of Texas # # That I'm going to see # # No other soldier knows her # # No soldier, only me # # She cried so when I left her # Please, accept our apologies.
We just thought you all might want to know that you're in the presence of a homicidal sociopath.
No, no, no!
He's not crazy.
No, we got a doctor's note and everything.
Nigel!
Just, um dropped some items.
Chief, so glad you're here.
I know who's been trying to kill Nigel.
And who was trying to take out Emilina.
And who tried to take out Emilina.
Mr. Spencer, last time I checked, Emilina overdosed on her own prescription medication.
That's precisely what Bevin Rennie Llywellen wanted you to think.
That's really his name?
That's the wanker who auditioned in every city.
Just another slice of deception.
The truth is, he can sing like a bird.
But if you heard that, he wouldn't have to reaudition in every city on the tour.
Every city that you almost died in, Nigel.
And after Emilina was released, he tried to silence her for good before she could put it all together.
Put what together?
And who might this be, Detectives?
Meet Bevin Rennie Llywellen.
Ms. Saffron woke up out of her coma, rabbit-punched me in the sternum, and remembered this guy as one of her assailants.
This crystal puts him at the scene of the crime.
So he made an attempt on Emilina's life.
Allegedly poisoned a tuna salad sandwich.
Uh, tuna Nicoise salad sandwich, Chief.
There's a difference.
But what about all the other near misses with Nigel?
But it can't be him.
It's impossible.
He was just a contestant.
Sounds like he had somebody on the inside.
He had somebody on the inside.
Didn't he?
Zzzapato!
Don't be ridiculous.
Zapato adores me.
Plus he can't even think.
Oh, it has to be someone else.
Um, how about Lester?
Oh, I'd love to see him in prison.
Bevin is Zapato's biggest fan.
They actually became pretty good friends.
And I don't think this show turned out to be quite the comeback either of them were hoping for.
I could go on.
But why don't you take the floor?
Zzzapato.
Well, what could he say?
He can't even speak.
Yes, I can!
But you don't let me.
I was the first to sign on.
This was supposed to be my show!
My shot, my comeback!
You turned me into a simp.
I freakin' hate you!
People don't even know who I am.
I get fan letters addressed to Geraldo, Ricky Martin, and that guy from El Pollo Loco commercial!
You ruined everything!
Why won't you die?
Really?
That was your plan?
That has to be the poorest-executed attack in history.
I was two feet away from you all the time.
I mean, you have to be absolutely, without doubt, the worst murder I have ever seen.
Did you # Mira me # Are you ready, Santa Barbara, for the next two contestants on American Duos?
# Shout, shout # # Let it all out # # These are the things # # I can do without # # Come on # # He's talking to you # # Come on # # Shout, shout # # Let it all out # # These are the things # # He can do without # # Come on # # Dig it, dig it, come on # # He's talking to you # # Come on # # Dig it, dig it, come on # All right, give it up for Shawn Spence Starr and Gus TT Showbizz!
Great job, gentlemen.
Now let's see what our judge thought.
Come on over.
Sit.
What, are you kidding me?
You look like a couple of rodeo clowns up there.
Nothing was in synch.
Your hairstyles are ridiculous.
You butchered a terrific song, and it's time you went home.
Please, spare us additional torture and just euthanize yourselves.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Please don't touch it.
Excuse me.
Gus, Gus, Gus!
Where's your project, Shawn?
- Did you even do it?
- My project?
Of course I did it.
When?
When?
Last night.
It's right here.
This head is to exact scale.
It took me three months to make it.
Yours took five minutes.
No, Gus, you're totally wrong.
It took me a whole hour.
Check this out.
I hate you, Shawn.
Lompoc.
Okay, I did it.
That's seven in row.
Eight the gas station guy confessed last week!
Oh, I wouldn't call myself a hero.
I'm just doing my job just like all of you.
Hey, that's enough goofing off.
Let's get back to work, huh?
You too.
Ladies and gentlemen, Detective Lassiter!
Oh, stop it!
- Jules!
- Shawn.
- Is there a problem?
- With what?
With you.
With me.
With the Chief.
She hasn't called in a month.
Is she still mad about me requisitioning the Segway?
You did that?
No.
Well, I don't really have time right now, but the short answer is we just haven't really needed any outside help.
Well, what's the long answer?
I mean, throw a "but" in there and add something about a dream where you and I got thrown out of a mattress showroom.
Detective Lassiter is literally on fire.
What kind of fire are we talking about?
Michael Jackson in the Pepsi commercial fire or misusing the word "literally" fire?
He's solved eight cases in a row fire.
Nine I just rembered the DeShano case.
Hey, Shawn.
What's new?
You still doing the psychic thing?
Is this some sort of weird dream?
On the last two cases, the first suspect Lassiter questioned confessed.
It's really magnificent.
We are talking about Carlton Lassiter, right?
Yea high?
Bats ninth for the department softball team?
Tenth.
We play with a rover.
Spencer, long time, no see.
Or is that no need?
I can't believe this.
Oh, believe it.
It's real.
They've done a preliminary on the body down at the marina, Detective.
They're ready for you at the scene.
Well, I would love to stay and chat, but duty does call.
Oh, Spencer, you look so sad.
Come on, we'll show you how real cops do it.
No comeback?
Shawn, that's slightly embarrassing.
Where'd you get that suit?
The toilet store?
Good luck with this one, Detective.
There's no identification.
Nobody's been reported missing fitting this description.
Oh, Mr. Spencer.
I'm surprised you didn't take the Segway.
She did know about that.
O'Hara just told me.
Traitor.
I'll deal with you later.
So what's the new case we've got?
A slight error in grammar there, buddy.
Which part?
"Got.
" I came all the way down from the office, Shawn.
Gus, don't be a giant snapping turtle.
We'll have a case in five minutes.
Nobody can explain these puncture wounds.
We can't rule out an animal attack.
No no, there's nothing in these waters with a bite radius that large.
No, this is maybe a boating accident.
The wounds caused by some machinery.
I can't really be sure at this juncture.
Completely stumped.
You getting something, Mr. Spencer?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
No, no, no!
No, hold on.
Okay, I've got it.
The wound on the head was caused by the edge of a boat when he fell in the water unconscious.
And the wounds on the back, they were caused by a large industrial crab trap.
Or a whale.
It definitely could've been a whale.
Lost from his pod.
Separated, migrating north or south.
And sees our man dead, already floating up above the surface.
Thinks it's a seal and then whale.
A whale?
What's your guy got?
Watch and learn, Jules.
Watch and learn.
Or Detective, if you don't mind, I'd like to see what Mr. Spencer has to offer.
All right, look, this is gonna be a little rough, okay?
I didn't have time for shading.
There's no forced perspective.
If I had really had my druthers, I would've done it in charcoal.
You know what I'm talking about.
Look, what I'm trying to say is, I'm not the artist I'd like to be Okay, Mr. Spencer, enough.
Can you or can you not tell us who's responsible for this man's death?
If I can present you with a semi-accurate sketch of the culprit, is that enough to get us on this case?
Yes.
All right.
The puncture wounds.
They're the key.
Giving me the impression that this crime could only have been committed by this guy.
This guy here.
Excuse me.
What?
Chief?
Where are you off to?
So what, that's a no?
Gus!
This is not a boating accident.
# I know you know # # That I'm not telling the truth # # I know you know # # They just don't have any proof # # Where's the deception?
# # Learn how to bend # # Your worst inhibitions # # Tend to psych you out in the end # You're mad.
No, I'm not mad.
I'm happy.
I'm thrilled.
I love looking like an idiot.
Well, that explains your shoes.
You almost closed down our agency with that little act of yours, Shawn.
Me?
You're the one spending all your extra time at your little "side project.
" You mean my real job?
Soon to be my only job?
Gus, you're panicking.
Don't panic.
Those bite marks are consistent with a tyrannosaurus bite.
You know that.
Yes, I know that.
The hard way.
I was canned from the Wyoming Natural History Museum for that little shot.
The bruises from the teeth didn't go away for a year, but totally worth it.
It was my best screensaver ever.
Gus, please, connecting a dinosaur to this case is the least of our worries.
Look, I can I stash a toy dinosaur in the window of the killer.
I can link him to a box of Dino Bites or Fruity Pebbles.
I can play Six Degrees of Dinosaur with you right now.
You've never been in a movie with Kevin Bacon or a Dilaposaurus, have you?
How about you play Six Degrees of Kiss My Ass?
First of all, that sounds like a totally disturbing game.
What's weird is that my guess on the jaw radius was actually spot on.
It almost seems to make sense.
So now you're getting on board with your own joke theory?
How are you gonna match your bite radius to the victim, Shawn?
Drag the body to the Wyoming museum?
I can do you one better.
What?
I need to borrow my dad's truck.
You coming or what?
That's clearly a no.
The one thing we can be sure of is the cause of death was not drowning.
Blunt force trauma to the head was severe enough to knock him unconscious.
More than likely he fell from some sort of a platform after knocking himself on the head.
And this is how he ended up in the water?
No, he landed on something hard.
Dislocated a rib.
He has bruises consistent with a six, seven, or eight-foot fall.
My guess is that he landed on something else and ultimately expired before tumbling into the water.
You know, this might be a leap, but I would check the offshore oil rigs.
See if any of them are missing workers.
I'll make some calls.
Interesting, Detective.
Thanks, Chief.
This theory feels good.
Just makes sense.
The work boots, the odd configuration of the wounds.
You know us, Ted.
It's worth a shot, right?
- We don't go out on limbs too often - Thanks, guys.
I just need to measure something.
Oh, good!
You're all here.
Get ready to be shocked.
Can we get the sheet off the dead guy, please?
Confirming the bite radius No!
Mr. Spencer Whoa, hey, hey, be careful.
This isn't mine.
Mr. Spencer, your antics have always been a little let's say unorthodox.
But let me be as frank as I can be with my assessment of your most recent behavior.
Seek help.
Chief, sometimes you have to jump off a cliff.
You have to close your eyes.
You have to unhook your clip "chasses" Chassis?
Climbing thing and you have to leap.
Now I ask you, Chief will you leap with me?
Are you thinking about jumping off a cliff?
Maybe.
Dad!
I've brought the keys back.
Hello!
Okay, this is creepy.
Why is Gus here?
Why do you think, Shawn?
He's a hostage.
Perhaps I can shed some light on that.
Two hostages.
Doug Devette is an old colleague of mine from the force.
The Chief asked me to have him drop by.
Why?
Doug is the department psychologist, Shawn.
What is this, some sort of intervention?
Yeah, sort of.
We don't like to use the term "intervention," Shawn.
Gus?
Don't look at me.
I'm here for the cupcakes.
Dad, I am not on drugs.
Oh, nobody thinks that, Shawn.
Well, I'm not completely sure about that, Doug.
We're all just a little concerned that you might be stretching yourself a bit too thin.
It wasn't my idea, but he's right, Shawn.
You're acting like a nut job.
Just because I take Gus' giant dinosaur head down to a dead body does not make me a nut job.
What?
You took my T-Rex?
My mom gave it to you?
Gladly.
She also gave me some pictures you can pay me to not show your next girlfriend.
What pictures?
The ones that document your Terence Trent D'Arby phase.
Whatever, Shawn.
You took Danny Dino to the police station?
No, Gus, give me some credit.
I took him to the morgue.
Good news.
Your specifications were spot on.
Your father tells me you have delusions of magical powers.
Delusions?
Really.
Doug, I'm employed as a psychic.
I've solved 18 cases this year.
I have business cards and a personalized coffee mug that backs up the whole thing.
I feel things about people.
You, for instance, are color blind.
That's nothing to be ashamed off.
You're also really stressed about something.
College.
It can be very expensive, Doug.
Oh, that was good, Henry.
Doug, do not be a stooge.
Not a stooge, but in this one case, he was right.
Knock at door.
Karen, do you mind?
We're in the middle of an intervention here.
We don't have time for that.
But you're the one who asked for this.
And I thank you, Henry, but I'm afraid that this can't wait.
We just got a break in the case.
We just found out the name of the dead man.
You want to tell him who he is, Detective?
No.
His name was Christopher Franzen.
He is a paleontologist.
A dinosaur hunter.
As expected.
Doug pleasure was all mine.
Oh, no, Shawn, mine.
We should get together.
All right, here's what we know so far.
A man, a paleontology professor, washes ashore with wounds specific to a dinosaur.
I don't think we can rule out the possibility of island somewhere in the Pacific where dinosaurs do exist.
And have an appetite for Jeff Goldblum.
I'm being serious, Shawn.
Well, look who's Mr. Onboard and sounding like a whacked wombat.
Then what is it?
I don't know.
It actually scares me that my wild dinosaur reach landed so close to the bull's-eye.
This guy was possibly killed by something dinosaur-related, but it was probably a model or something from the archaeology department.
We'll have to spend the better part of the next 24 hours sifting through their entire collection of artifacts.
And by "we" I mean mostly you.
This is all there is?
No.
No, no, no.
This is just the big stuff.
We got the trilobites in a shoebox, but the shelf is kind of high.
You've got Pinhead, Chatterbox, Surgeon, and Stitch up there on a shelf?
Shawn, those are Cenobites.
Well, what are trilobites?
Fish fossils.
Oh, Gus, for my sake, at least pretend like you don't know this stuff off the top of your head.
Do this move.
Trilo trilobite?
What it'll help you!
I'm serious.
Look, Ethan, I can honestly say there were more historically significant items in the lost and found at the Taco John's in Porterville.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a little sad.
Word is the whole program is going under.
You sure about that?
Look, Professor Franzen would never really give us a straight answer.
In fact, most nights he wasn't around to give us any answers.
He was a pretty crappy advisor.
And when he did show up, he was late, tired, completely disheveled.
Nobody really trusted the guy.
Look, do not ever take a class from him.
He's dead.
Oh, yeah.
Then totally.
Well, this sure was a dead end.
Yep, but at least we were the first ones to find the dead end.
Oh, come on!
He really is on fire.
Literally.
I don't get this.
The cops beat us to the dead guy's house.
I don't know how I feel about the police department being so proactive.
Feeling the heat?
What, do you think I'm afraid of a little competition?
I know you're afraid of competion.
Why else would you have purposefully broken the Battlezone at Pizza Royale?
Dude, you beat me once.
And only because you first used the eye piece and then revealed you had pinkeye.
Let's venture off the beaten path.
What's wrong?
I'm just trying to figure out what to do here, since as a rule we don't break and enter.
What do you mean we don't break and enter?
The 2400 Motel.
The Hotel de la Cruz.
The spellmaster's box.
Yeah, but we really shouldn't pick this lock.
You know I want to pick that lock.
Yes, I do.
Watch out.
What are you, the lock whisper?
Are you channeling Michael Jackson?
Who heard the second click?
I heard the second click.
Really?
Come on.
I can't see anything.
Oh, I got it, I got it.
Gus, that thing is brighter than the sun.
Think you just gave me glaucoma.
You can't give someone glaucoma.
Thank you.
This is better than the entire university department.
It sure is.
And his digging equipment is some heavy duty stuff.
Looks like some shovels are missing.
Part of a portable light kit.
A lot of brushes.
And fine finishing equipment, which I would assume he was only using in the lab.
Dude, I got something.
What?
He was the worst tic-tac-toe player in the history of the world.
I'm investigating and you're analyzing his doodles?
Doodles are the window to the soul, Gus.
Or maybe that's the epiglottis.
Where's the uvula?
Lassiter's here.
That guy's like five minutes behind us everywhere we go.
Don't sleep in the nude tonight.
Spencer.
Enjoying your time riding my behind?
Definitely not in the nude.
This lock looks too high tech for a backyard shed.
We gotta find somebody who can crack the code.
There's already someone here who can do that.
That person is me.
Well, make yourself useful.
I'll need you to step back, please.
Give me some room to operate.
Further, please.
Further.
Jules, could you help me out here?
Just get him back onto the cobblestone.
That's good, that's good.
Thank you.
I am sensing the first two digits.
What is it, 31?
Gus, help me out here.
Come on, buddy.
You can have my Tony Gwynn rookie.
25.
Eight?
Three.
Three!
Four?
Two.
And two.
There's one more.
Wait!
There's one more.
Nine.
That was amazing.
I'll give you that one.
Can't see a thing in here.
Oh, I've got it.
Wait, I'm sensing a light switch.
Tools are missing.
Good work, Detective.
He had a blunt force trauma.
That could be supplied by one of these missing items.
Maybe this rock hammer or this medium shovel.
But where would they be?
The bed of his pickup.
It wasn't parked out front or at the university.
We find that truck, we find the murder weapon.
Let's go, O'Hara.
Burning daylight.
Excuse us.
Man, you missed the truck?
I'm not the psychic.
What?
Why would someone frequent a fruit stand that's over 50 miles away?
They like pomegranate?
Yeah, I know him.
He was my best customer.
Don't know his name.
But he comes by every night before closing.
Did you ever see which way he went?
Yeah.
Always up the hill.
That's all I see.
Although every once in a while I see him come back down the hill early in the morning.
Well, thank you very much.
Gus, you got anything else?
Yes, is that peach pie in the back?
Yeah.
Another dead end.
Let's turn around.
Hold on a second.
This looks like a place someone's been sneaking into.
What is this?
Looks like some kind of farmland or grazing plain.
Oh, look at that.
It's like that movie.
The one with Sigourney Weaver.
- Aliens?
- No.
- Alien.
- No.
Alien: Resurrection.
Gus, the one with the holes and Shia LaBeouf.
They had holes in Shia LaBeouf?
The holes are in the ground, dude, like that.
And Jon Voight was walking around all crazy.
Oh,Anaconda.
Yeah, never mind.
Gorillas in the Mist?
- Death and the Maiden?
- No!
Half Moon Street?
Just let it go.
I'll be damned.
What?
!
Somebody's shooting at us!
Oh, God!
They're shooting!
We're gonna die!
Run, Gus!
Gus, run like the wind!
No get get up!
Come on, get in the car!
Hurry up, Shawn!
Start it, start it!
Go, go, go!
Dude, look at the road while you're driving!
- I'm staying down for safety.
- He was shooting directly into the air, Gus.
Bullets go up.
They have to come down.
Do you know what the trajectory would have to be for that to happen?
Don't you dare argue physics with me.
Not while we're in the process of almost being killed.
Didn't you see the "Trespassers Will Be Shot" sign?
Oh, yeah.
It totally said that.
My bad.
Mr. Spencer, if you have any substantial information concerning the Christopher Franzen case, please get on with it.
I've got something.
It's a cluck.
A cluck?
Actually there's two.
Two clucks.
A cluck-cluck here.
A bawk-bawk there.
Here a bawk.
There a Cluck?
Everywhere a bawk-baaawk.
Let me guess.
You have a name.
MacDonald, perhaps?
No.
No, it's a farm.
With a farmer.
An old farmer.
Farmer Shooty Pants.
That's a nickname.
- I don't think that's his actual handle.
- I've got it.
Lassiter found the paleontologist's truck.
- You helped.
- I did help.
It was his hunch.
It was down at the old marina.
I just had a feeling.
I also found the prints of a certain grad student named Ethan Robinson along with a stack of letters from said grad students demanding the professor stop ruining his life.
We're sending a car over to pick him up.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting your trance?
I don't buy it.
Which part?
The damning evidence or the murder weapon?
There's more going on in this guy's life.
Chief, I'm sensing digging.
Yeah, the archaeology department was going under.
He was trying to make a big discovery.
Put him on the map, get more funding.
The farm.
I can see the name of the farm.
It's Wallll Wall Walker Farms.
Yeah, we got that lead off the phone records Yesterday.
Apparently our victim made a series of phone calls to the farmer trying to buy some of his land, but it wasn't for sale.
Farmer was forthcoming, cooperative.
Definitely not a suspect.
Anything else?
I have to say, you have been very through.
We're just doing what any good cops would do.
- Shawn, what are you doing?
- Yeah, what are we doing, Shawn?
- I need to borrow some tools.
- What kind of tools?
Digging tools.
A little excavation project we got going on.
- Are you still on that dinosaur thing?
- We're still on that dinosaur thing?
What, is there an echo in here?
Yes, we're still on the dinosaur thing.
We step foot on the far end of this guy Walker's farm in Ojai and he starts blasting us with buckshot.
We know our dead guy was there every night leading up to his death, digging around the periphery of this property.
No, Shawn, wait.
I don't want you borrowing my tools.
Oh, Gus will leave his class ring as collateral.
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.
- Sure you will.
No, I won't.
I can't support this.
Well, there's a shocker.
You not being supportive.
Would you shut up and listen?
I'm saying I can't support you going somewhere where you could get shot.
What, are you Are you worried about me?
Shawn, I've been worried about you since you were three years old and started eating your own toenails.
Well, Dad, I'll be fine, okay?
We're not gonna go anywhere near the house.
And if it'll make you feel any better, I will stand behind Gus the entire time.
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.
- Oh, yes, I will.
You want to bet?
I don't like it.
It doesn't feel right.
I know feelings.
Pardon me?
Did Did you just say "I know feelings"?
Perfect.
This will be easy.
Oh, there's a pattern here.
Those guys dig with a reason.
How do you know that?
Gus, I worked at the museum for almost an entire weekend before I got canned.
He was the worst tic-tac-toe player in the history of the world.
Wait a second.
Those weren't tic-tac-toe boards.
Those were all the places he'd dug.
There were like 25 Xs.
No way he scored that often.
The Xs were misses.
In this case, "O" marks the spot.
And that's the "O".
This is the only hole filled by a bulldozer.
No self-respecting paleontologist would use a bulldozer.
Why do you know that?
Because, Shawn, if you use a bull - Gus, I don't actually want to know.
- Then don't ask.
This shouldn't take long.
Grab a shovel.
And keep an eye out for that farmer.
- How you doing on your side?
- Good, solid.
I'm holding up.
- Shawn!
- What?
I'm keeping watch.
That's how the other guy died.
What, you're not concerned?
All right, I get it!
It's my turn.
This is the end of the loose dirt.
Be careful.
This is weird.
What, that there's rocks in the ground?
These aren't rocks.
These are fossils.
But they've been processed, finished off, residue, rocks chipped away.
Stuff you would normally do in a lab.
Franzen found something.
Why wouldn't he just take it out and do the work in the lab where it should be done?
Unless Unless it was too big to move.
Oh, dude, I'm gonna get the leaf blower.
You brought a leaf blower?
You gotta be kidding me.
I just discovered a dinosaur.
Filling that hole was the worst idea ever.
It had to be done, Gus.
We have to save it for when we unmask Franzen's killer.
I still don't get it.
He was on the trail of a fossil graveyard.
It lead him right to Deacon Farms.
Farmer wouldn't let him dig on the land, so he takes matters into his own hands after hours.
But why wouldn't the farmer let him dig?
Maybe he didn't want his farm disturbed.
A dig like that is worth millions to a land owner.
And the fossils I discovered weren't even on crop land.
You discovered?
Don't try to take away my dinosaur discovery, Shawn.
I wouldn't dream of it.
I'm sorry.
It was all you.
I'm very proud of you.
Don't you think once they unearth that thing there would be a swarm of people crashing in from all over the world?
Why didn't he just lease the land?
I don't get it.
- I've got an idea.
- What?
Let's ask him.
What?
!
We're pretty sure we just found a cold-blooded murderer, and you want to go to his house and ask him about it?
We can ask nicely.
No!
All right, all right.
We come up with a cover story.
We're vacuum salesmen.
No Traveling gypsies.
No, no, no!
We'll do Of Mice and Men.
- I'm Lennie.
- No.
"George, you said that I could take care of those rabbits, George".
Shawn.
"And later on you're gonna cook those beets.
" Shawn!
"Beets make me go " No Lennie.
Gus, you know how long I've been waiting to pull out my Lennie?
No, Shawn, we do the National Paleontology Society thing as agreed.
And we keep it very, very simple.
It's not as much fun as whipping out my Lennie.
And why are we stopping here?
Have you tried these peaches?
You're back.
Yes, sir, we are.
We're addicted to your citrus.
Peaches aren't citrus, Shawn.
They're stone fruit.
- It's the same thing.
- No, not the same thing.
They have pits.
Peaches, cherries, plums, and apricots.
I can't do this with you right now.
Does your fruit come from Walker Farms?
Oh, no.
We grow on our own little parcel of land.
Deacon Walker's farm used to be a supplier of ours years ago, but they don't grow nearly as much as they used to.
Thank you so much for your information.
If you have a moment, my friend and I would like to buy every peach on that truck.
Including the one you're eating.
You sure you don't want to do Of Mice And Men?
You so much as slur one word, I'll give you an Indian burn so hot your socks will catch fire.
"Indian burn.
" I haven't been threatened with that this millennium.
Take a shot if your ulna feels safe.
I don't think the ulna's in the forearm.
Trust me, it is.
- How can you Indian burn a bone?
- Stop analyzing my threat.
- Get it right.
- I got it right.
- Deacon Walker?
- Sullivan Walker.
Is Deacon Walker home?
There is no Deacon Walker.
That's confusing.
I've got nothing.
Gus?
Then why name the farm Deacon Walker Farms?
Because it used to be called Deacon Walker.
Roger Deacon was my partner.
He's not anymore.
That cleans it up nicely.
- Maybe we come in?
- No.
What do you want?
We're from the National Paleontological Society Not interested.
Clearly he's not interested.
We would like to make you a very sizeable offer on a very small portion of your Hello, my name is Lennie.
I like to You think he'd open up if we knocked again?
I'm glad it only took us an hour to get up here.
Not like I wasted a whole day.
Franzen dug up here too?
No, he didn't.
These are all new and dug with a bulldozer.
A real paleontologist would never use such an indelicate tool.
I got it.
- So our farmer's been digging too.
- Right.
But if the gold mine's out there, why is he digging over here?
It's my dad.
Think he wants his leaf blower back?
Shawn?
Shawn, you're not anywhere near that farmhouse, are you?
Dad, how dare you?
Of course not.
Good.
Stay away, Shawn.
I know where I rember that farm.
Deacon Walker Farm.
I was up there about 20 years ago.
A girl reported that her boyfriend went missing.
Roger Deacon.
He was a partner in the farm.
He was never found, Shawn.
Never found?
That's right, the farmer claimed he went back to England or some nonsense.
The point is, we never found out where he went.
I think I might know where he is.
Where?
- I might be looking at him.
- Shawn!
Gotta go.
Shawn!
God - Dude.
- What?
It now appears a lot of our evidence is circumstantial.
We're checking the grad student's alibi, but I'm not as confident as I like to be.
- Shawn Spencer's on line one.
- What does he want?
He wants us to go meet him in the Ojai Valley somewhere.
We're in the middle of the Franzen case.
I told him that.
He guarantees that in ten minutes he can solve the case, nab the killer, close an additional unsolved murder, and And what?
Unearth a dinosaur.
Well I'm curious.
This is as far as my property goes.
That's all there is.
Well, I've answered all your questions, Detective.
What more do you want from me?
- I'm not entirely sure, sir.
- We just have one more person we need you to talk to.
Lennie?
Lennie?
Don't even ask.
My name is not Lennie, Mr. Walker.
But if it were, - I would've been amazing.
- No, you wouldn't have.
Would've brought tears, Gus.
Guys, the point?
The truth is I'm a psychic.
I work for the SBPD.
And the mystic vibrations of the sea have brought me here to solve not one, but two murders.
You're a what?
Christopher Franzen was a persistent annoyance, huh?
He couldn't help it.
His department was going under.
He was desperate to find something significant to save his career.
And he knew that your property held the key.
But you wouldn't let him dig.
You couldn't let him dig.
So he did what any self-respecting paleontologist on the verge of a nervous breakdown would do.
He dug anyway.
Secretly.
Under the blanket of night.
And into the early morning.
And he dug, and he dug, and he found something.
And that's when you found him.
You knew the magnitude of the find.
Once word got out, you'd never be able to keep the rest of the world from digging here too.
And you couldn't have the rest of the world digging here either, could you?
Shawn!
Dad?
What are you doing here?
I was worried.
About my tools.
What?
If I had known you were finally smart enough to bring some backup, I wouldn't have had to come up here, Shawn.
Shawn, will you tell them why Walker wouldn't let him dig?
Roger Deacon.
Deacon is buried on the property!
Dad!
Dad, you just blew the big reveal.
You already mentioned his name, Shawn.
No, Deacon was the partner Walker killed 20 years ago.
- Hey, now wait a minute here - He what now?
Yeah, he killed Deacon and he buried him somewhere on the farm and he can't rember where.
Isn't that right, Farmer Shooty Pants?
I don't have to stand here and take this.
No, actually you do.
What does this have to do with Christopher Franzen?
He killed Franzen when he caught him standing above his dinosaur skull discovery, sending him flying right into the teeth of the dinosaur.
But he couldn't bury him here.
No, no, no, he had called the farm.
He had snooped around the farm.
There was a trail to the farm.
No, he had to dump him somewhere where there'd be no forensics.
Like the ocean.
Just let the salt water clean the corpse and wash it ashore.
And the murder scene.
Well, he hopped on his handy bulldozer and filled the hole.
I'm getting a bad feeling about your streak.
You too, huh?
I think I need a lawyer.
I think you're right.
Put your hands behind your back.
- What?
- You heard me.
You still haven't answered the question why he dug all the holes around the house, Shawn.
Dad, that's the finale.
That's why I don't invite you to these things.
He was looking for Deacon's body.
Whatever.
Are we done here, Mr. Spencer?
No, we're not done.
For my final demonstration I will now discover a dinosaur.
Shawn!
Actually Gus will discover a dinosaur.
Wait a second.
You just want me to dig this hole.
I do not.
I'm not falling for that, Shawny boy.
You dig it.
I'll take credit for the discovery.
Oh, no, you won't.
Give me that shovel.
It's too late.
You blew it.
What?
!
And whoever discovers it gets to name it.
I'm naming him Zippy.
Or Chompy.
Zippy the Dinosaur, discovered by psychic paleo-sleuth Shawn Spencer!
Give me this shovel, Shawn!
Killed by a dinosaur.
And he's right.
It was an actual dinosaur.
Technically, it's the fall that killed him.
Not helping.
Who am I kidding?
I am doomed.
I am never gonna suspect an extinct creature.
How can I compete with that?
You don't have to compete.
O'Hara, I am physically incapable of pointing the finger at a dragon or a leprechaun or the Loch Ness Monster.
I quit.
I'm gonna donate my badge to charity.
It was a good run, Carlton.
All streaks have to end.
Lou Boudreau fielded the ball cleanly.
You have to let it go.
Who the hell is Lou Boudreau?
He recorded the out that ended DiMaggio's hit streak.
Don't you watch baseball?
Of course I watch baseball.
I just don't know meaningless - facts from 75 years ago.
- 66.
You disturb me.
Do you need a hug?
Oh, what do I look like?
Yeah, I'll take the hug.
Okay, thanks.
Okay.
Oh, come on, you guys.
We're still doing this intervention thing?
Yes, yes, Shawn, we are.
Son, you have no sense of responsibility.
And lately you've been purposefully putting yourself in a severe amount of unnecessary danger.
On top of which, you are constantly belittling the good work of Actually, Henry, I stretched the truth a bit.
This isn't about Shawn.
- This is about you.
- What?
Can we talk about your obsessive need for control?
You come into my house, Devette.
You lie to me?
!
Let's try to be rational.
Did you really drive all the way up to Ojai just to crash Shawn's crowning moment?
Get out.
Henry, we're here for you.
- At least listen.
- Out now.
Get out!
Out!
I'd like to start.
When I was about seven, he
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Look I'm telling you, my son Shawn did not have a permission to go on that field trip.
Well, he did turn in his permission slip signed by you.
Signature's a forgery.
It's a fake.
Well, that's a little dramatic, don't you think, Mr. Spencer?
Look, this form is a counterfeit.
These are serious charges.
And my son needs to be punished.
Mr. Spencer all three are permission slips also signed by you.
Yes.
Yes.
- Yes, those those are my signatures.
- Well, you see, then?
I'd be hard-pressed to believe that a child of Shawn's age could be capable of such detailed forgery.
Well, you don't know my son.
No offense, but you are the vice principal of a middle school, not a handwriting expert.
That testimony's not gonna hold up in court.
Well, we're not talking court.
Are we?
You know, 'cause if we were, you should know that I did take a handwriting personality course at the Learning Annex last summer.
And I can tell by the way you, uh, turn your N humps that you have a very open and childlike kindness about you.
I could be off on that.
You know, it it was a one-night seminar.
Okay now, as a sergeant with the Santa Barbara Police Department, let me tell you what I know.
See the pen lift on the R there?
The bleed mark that shows hesitation, as if thinking, "Gee.
How do I form that next letter"?
Now I don't know about you, but I don't have to think about how to sign my own damn name So you're wrong.
Really?
I don't know, Dad.
I think Mr. Petlic has a point.
They look pretty identical to me.
Hey, check it out.
There's Lassiter.
Make a loop like a bunny's ear, wrap it around, careful as you steer That's a good boy, Lassie.
Wait a minute.
You're not Lassie.
Well, I don't know what a Lassie is, but I'm not it.
I'm Special Agent Lars Ewing with the FTD.
- You're a special florist?
- Federal Treasury Department.
We have a department that deals exclusively with treasures?
If you'll excuse me, I have a meeting in an Interim Chief Vick's office.
That's where our meeting is!
This is very exciting.
I feel nervous.
Is that what you're wearing?
This goes against every federal bone in my body, but who are you guys?
I'm not familiar with the federal bone.
Is that connected to the hip bone or the knee bone?
Well, I can tell you what the knee bone is gonna connect with - if you don't get out of my way.
- I'm gonna guess.
Not the funny bone?
- This meeting is bigger than we thought.
- Yeah.
Get us some seats close to the desk, but not on the side.
I'll catch up in a second.
Waiting for Godot?
Guffman.
Waiting to exhale?
I'm not waiting to exhale.
- Shawn Spencer.
- Lindsay Leikin.
I'm the head psychic in the department.
This is - sort of my joint.
- They, um - hire psychics around here?
- Personally, I'm a little bit skeptical.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
I was just getting a very strong vibration.
Did you did you just recently take up the guitar?
Oh, my God.
Yes, just recently.
Very impressive.
How did you do that?
Sometimes there's just this amazingly strong connection from the word go.
I'm getting something else.
This is gonna be a very, very good week for you, - Lindsay Leikin.
- Really, I - didn't think - Just let it happen.
So let me officially welcome you to Santa Barbara.
We are all ready and willing to Don't let me interrupt.
Please continue.
What'd I say about seats on the side?
Mr. Spencer, this is Special Agent Ewing from the Treasury Department in Washington.
Yes, we sniffed one another in the hallway.
He is here because they have been tracking an aggressive forger who's been counterfeiting large numbers of $100 bills and then laundering the money into small communities across the country.
The last being a Home Depot right here in the heart of your little hamlet.
Well, we are raring to help you with this federal bust.
Who is this?
This is Carlton Lassiter, our head detective, and his junior partner, Juliet O'Hara.
Ah, the name Juliet.
"How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night.
" Shakespeare.
Romeo and Juliet.
"Tootie, you in trouble.
" It's Mindy Cohn.
Facts of Life.
Could you gentlemen please state your name once again?
And please speak clearly.
Is that a recording device?
Government issued?
Asking if that is a recording device is like asking if this is a pen.
- Is it a pen?
- That's classified.
It's tiny.
- Probably can't hold much.
- Oh, that's not a tape recorder.
That is a high-tech microphone system attached to a Mildred.
A Mildred?
What's what's a Mildred?
I believe it's an intelligence-gathering device.
"Mildred" is probably an anagram.
Military Intel Listening Device Recorder something.
Mildred is not a device.
She's my stenographer.
You have your own stenographer?
I am hyper-careful.
Can't take any chances.
Saved my behind more than once in making cases stick past deposition.
- Brilliant.
Chief?
- Not happening.
Now what I need from all of you is your full cooperation in assisting Special Agent Ewing in any way he sees fit.
- Now, any questions?
- I have a question for Special.
- Who is this?
- I'm sorry.
This is Shawn Spencer.
And his partner, Burton Guster.
Mr. Spencer is a psychic with the department who I thought might be helpful.
Well, next time I have to go on a panty raid, I'll give him a call.
But we already have our own psychic.
She's just started in the department and she is already a superstar.
Got us so close to the counterfeiter a month ago in Wilmette, Illinois.
We must have missed him by only a few minutes.
- Mr. Spencer, - Lindsay Leikin.
- We too met in the hallway.
- Okay, then let's adjourn this meeting.
I know Special Agent Ewing has prepared informational packets for all of you.
- We will meet at the Home Depot tomorrow.
- Let's say 0700 hours.
- 700 hours is almost 20 days.
- Shouldn't we act sooner?
- 0700 is 7:00 a. m. - Precisely, Detective.
- Striking and whip-smart.
Intriguing.
- I knew that too.
You have Pennsylvania Ave.
Running through your veins.
Ever consider taking the Bureau exam?
I have.
Let me set up that conference area for you.
Right this way.
Little skeptical of psychics, are we?
I should have said "just you.
" And don't think I didn't pick up on that calluses on my hands guitar clue.
Good one.
This is gonna be good.
I'm gonna solve this case, and I'm gonna prove you're a fake.
Fun, right?
Okay, you are all instructed to cooperate fully with the federal agents.
I'll be damned if we're gonna get shown up on our own turf.
They may be the feds, but we are a team and this is our town.
They will need us.
You breached protocol, Leikin.
I waited outside the hotel, 0630.
- You weren't there.
- Yeah, sorry.
I got up early and went to go get coffee.
Son, let me ask you a question.
What made you think those $100 bills were authentic?
Um, 'cause they said "100" on them.
Are you an idiot?
Don't answer that.
If I plopped a Granny Smith apple down on this counter and carved a "100" on it, would you accept that as legal tender?
Don't answer that.
Do you know what microprinting is?
- I'm confused.
Should I answer that?
- I know what it is.
The introduction of microprinting as an anti-replicant feature began in 1990 with the addition of the words "United States of America" printearound Ben Franklin's lapel.
In addition, the words "U.S. 100" are printed within the lines of the lower left 100.
I'm sorry is it just me, or is this unbearably boring?
I don't know how Ms. Leikin works, but Gus and I are going to investigate the body of the store and search for our culprit's twisted, wretched, filthy aura.
Because that is what serious psychics do.
Shawn.
What are you doing?
- Shawn?
- Dad.
Wow, you look so tiny down there.
What the hell are you doing up there?
What does it look like I'm doing?
We're making a case.
- A federal one.
- Oh, of course you are.
Well, when you've finished wrapping things up for the Pentagon, I want you at my house.
I got a project for you.
Afraid we're gonna be a little busy having our pictures taken with the President of the United States of America.
Mm, oh, I think you'll be there.
- You owe me.
- I owe you?
Yeah, for the last 12 times I helped you solve one of your little cases - you agreed.
- Gus, did I agree to that?
Well, technically I think you did.
See ya.
- Excuse me.
Can I help you guys?
- Hello, Garrison.
We're working on the counterfeiting case.
And we need to see all of yesterday's security footage.
How do you know my name's Garrison?
You thought this was gonna be a problem?
I'm sorry, man.
I I didn't mean to freak you out.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm a psychic with the police department.
There was already a psychic here last night.
From Washington, no less.
She looked at all the tapes and there was no positive ID.
She already came here, huh?
And she's good.
She also knew my name was Garrison.
Uh, you mind if I take a peek anyway?
I work a little differently than her.
My process is a little more complex.
I can sometimes pick up images that are underneath the - epidermal layer.
- Here it is.
This is the tape of the counterfeiter that she looked at last night.
You know, honestly, if that pretty lady psychic couldn't pick up anything, I can't imagine you're gonna have much luck.
You know what, you're probably right.
We gave it a shot.
Thanks, Garrison.
Tall?
Short?
Age?
Race?
Do you mean to tell me that the only thing you can remember clearly is that he was a man?
And technically, I can't even be sure of that, now, can I?
Wait.
I'm getting something.
- He did not wear corrective lenses.
- Actually, that is true.
Okay, well, that's something to go on.
Good work, Mr. Spencer.
Great and so we're looking for someone in Santa Barbara - who does not wear glasses.
- He He had a small scar about three inches, on the jaw line.
And he wore a single stud diamond in his left ear.
Yes.
And yes.
She's exactly right.
I can see that clearly now.
That's why she's the best.
Tough break.
Wh Jules Dad, I'm confused.
There are plans for a wet bar.
Yeah, that's right.
For entertaining.
Right, but I don't see anywhere in the plans the portal into 1976.
Shawn, a wet bar happens to be a timeless home feature.
Right, perfect for those warm summer evenings when Reggie Jackson and Dyan Cannon swing by for Harvey Wallbangers.
Shawn.
Are you gonna crack wise or are you gonna get to work?
I feel like it should be noted that neither Gus nor myself - are licensed plumbers.
- Yes, I understand that, Shawn.
I've already installed the sink.
All you two have to do is connect the fittings.
All right.
- Let's get to work.
- Seriously?
- This will be good.
- It will?
Work is good, Gus.
Work is glorious.
It's the breath of life.
- What is this?
- It's a drill.
Of course it is.
Don't be ridiculous.
You're still upset that Lindsay showed you up at the crime scene, aren't you?
What is her trick?
- Maybe she's just more psychic-y than you.
- Gus, don't be ridiculous.
- There's no such thing as psychics.
- I don't know, Shawn.
Even I've been getting a little bit of intuition lately.
In fact, I'm getting something right now.
Something very strong.
She's she's better than you.
You know, they say imitation is the greatest form of flattery, but that hurts.
- It hurts below the belt.
- Shawn, if you want to beat her, then we have to actually work the case.
Utilize my knowledge.
You know I have a coin collection.
I've studied tender from around the world.
I have over 85 Buffalo nickels, Shawn.
Okay.
First of all, and this is key, don't ever, under any circumstances, ever admit that to anyone outside of these walls.
Secondly, I love utilizing your knowledge, Gus.
I can't wait until we have the case of the missing thimble.
But this case is not about counterfeiting.
It's about me versus her.
Ecks versus Sever.
- Joe versus the Volcano.
- Fine.
Then let's get to it.
- What do you know?
- All right, this is what I got.
He managed not to be identified on any of the security cameras, which means he's smart.
Smart enough to stay ahead of the game.
Which means changing up anything that could be linked or traced to him.
Like his vehicle.
His key.
It was distinctively Nissan.
Probably a Murano.
Maybe a Sentra.
So we go back and check the outdoor surveillance cameras from the store, and look for Nissans - in the parking lot yesterday.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I already tipped Lassiter off to that.
The only one that didn't check out was a new one with no plates.
Ewing's informational packet links this guy to over a dozen vehicles since he left Washington.
His pattern's to spend six to eight days in a town before pricking up ears.
- You read Ewing's informational packet?
- Cover to cover.
That's weird.
I just read the cover.
But I don't need to read the whole thing to know that that's his M.O. He's too smart to still be driving that car, Gus.
He's gotta be switching out his mode of transportation - on a daily basis.
- And paying cash.
Gotta launder as much of that funny money as he can.
So the question is, to which car dealership would a crook go to spend lots of cash without pricking up ears?
This must be what Jay Leno feels like when he walks into his garage.
Which makes you Kevin Eubanks.
I don't think they roll around town together, Shawn.
- Can we talk to the owner?
- First we play customer.
It's the people who groove on the floor that are gonna give us the scoop, Gus.
Excuse me, my buddy here is interested in the bana yellow Ferrari, though he's neither gay nor European.
I hope that's not a prob Look who finally figured it out.
Little late.
How did you not notice her, Shawn?
- I wasn't expecting her to be here.
- You were looking right at her She's got me all out of whack.
- Get your head in the game.
- So what's going on?
No one calls us anymore.
That's the new thing?
I thought we were a team.
Yeah, first of all, the whole "team" thing.
She wasn't talking to you.
And secondly, Ewing didn't call me.
He called O'Hara.
- It's not like I asked him to.
- It's okay, Clarice.
- You don't have to make excuses to us.
- It wasn't just today.
My phone's been ringing all the time.
I don't know how he got my home number.
I mean, please.
Do you think I wanted to pick up my phone at 2:00 a. m. and hear his voice all gravelly and masculine?
Probably called from the hotel.
Maybe just got out of the shower or finished with a swim.
Dripping wet.
Just catch Mr. Spencer and Mr. Guster up on what Ms. Leikin was able to figure out.
Apparently our guy came in here, bought a used Lamborghini - for $47,000 in cash.
- Next day, he tries to return it.
All sales are final, but the sales manager makes a concession, offering mere $26,000 in cash.
He accepts it?
What kind of idiot is this guy?
A genius idiot, according to the feds.
You see, those familiar with this sort of thing know that it's the classic grift.
Essentially, he traded 47 Gs of worthless paper for $26,000 in cold, hard cash.
I've seen it before.
- Where, in a Mamet play?
- Any witnesses?
No, but a Lamborghini was spotted outside of town in Goleta, but it was moving too fast to make an ID.
You know, I don't think he's a swimmer.
He's not really that build.
I bet he plays rugby.
Hey, what color is that suit?
- Black.
- Really?
- It seems blacker than black.
- It's Washington black.
Look, if anyone wants to join me, I'm gonna be taking a look at some of the bills from the safe that didn't get deposited.
Look, Leikin, I think it's possible that we got off on the wrong foot.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I mean, this is silly.
We should join forces like Pitt and Jolie, you know?
Work together, make it nice for everyone.
I don't think you get it.
I have nothing to gain here.
If you haven't noticed, my job is safe.
It's you I'm worried about, faker.
- In that case, maybe we should just date.
- I'm seeing somebody.
- Well, is it - Serious?
Yes.
- You didn't know I was gonna - Yes, I did.
Dude, don't you know the move where you take off your jacket and you lay it across some seats?
- Get your head in the game, Shawn.
- Uh, budgies?
These are good.
But they're not great.
You see how on this bill, the edge of the nose on Ben Franklin's cloudy?
Did you get that, Mildred?
Hey, is there any reason a $100 bill would change colors?
Actually, yes.
It's an effect caused by color-shifting ink.
It's only present in $100 bills.
The changing color is called color diffraction.
And it's made possible when light reflects off of metallic flakes added to the ink.
- Good work, Gus.
- Thank you.
So we'll check the information that Ms. Leikin's gathered for us Thank goodness!
Finally, some nice seats, huh?
This is what I'm talking about.
What?
Did I did I just sit in something?
- Gus, do I have pudding on my jeans?
- No, no.
- Nothing?
- Shawn.
I think we're not welcomed here.
Gus, don't be a paranoid schizophrenic.
- We're always welcome here.
- No, look.
- Oh, my God.
We're not welcome.
- It's nothing personal, Mr. Spencer.
Special Agent Ewing just feels that Ms. Leiken has things covered on the psychic front.
And I have to agree with him.
Okay.
Take a hint.
Certainly don't need to be told twice.
I think you were just told three times.
You know what, this is fine, because we had a good run.
Thank you for the memories.
Oh, just one more thing.
You might want to check the cash from the dealership, because it's not all counterfeit.
That's ridiculous.
If I had learned how to laugh as a child, I would right now.
I looked at all those bills myself.
Do you really want to go against the leading special agent in counterfeiting with 14 years of experience under his belt and say that those bills weren't fake?
Not all of them.
Just one.
And I believe the serial number was - ALD 975 7080 7 - 7!
Where are we going?
Shouldn't we have stayed until they checked the bills out?
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
- Spencer.
Hold up.
- The bill checked out.
It's real.
All right.
Answer me this, Mr. Psychic.
Why would a counterfeiter ever use real bills?
Because he had to Man I read your informational packet cover to cover.
Our guy spends six to eight days in every city we're only on day four.
Quite simply, he ran out of dough.
He didn't know what kind of deal he'd be able to make on the car.
Turns out, short one bill.
- Lucky for us.
- So what's our next move?
Well, I'll call Washington and begin I'm sorry, I was asking Mr. Spencer.
Oh oh, you want to know what I think his next move is.
Oh, Gus, look, she wants Well, let's see here.
He's gotta print more money.
My guess is he, uh, set up shop here in town.
So we find his little nest, we find him.
Well, buddy I really hope you like this.
It took me 19 hours to bake.
Put it in last night before bed.
It takes 19 hours to bake a pineapple upside-down cake?
It does when it's being heated by a 60-watt bulb.
It's not upside down, Shawn.
Who could that be at this hour?
Are you gonna invite me in?
Eh Uh guess.
So this is what a psychic detective office looks like.
You know, I always imagined it Does something smell like pineapple?
Pineapple upside-down cake.
Would you like some?
Wait.
Before you answer that, are you a fan of delicious flavor?
All right, look.
This isn't easy for me to say, but I was wrong.
You're better than I thought.
Your discovery at the station today was a huge get.
I think we should work together after all.
The faster we find out where the counterfeiter's den is, the better.
That is, if you guys are willing.
I don't know.
Depends.
Don't you think, Gus?
Wait.
I'm definitely getting something.
Oh, this is good.
It's a it's a it's a transient location.
Uh, where people can come and go anonymously, paying in cash.
And and it's remote, so they can print large sums of money on a noisy printer without being heard.
- Yes yes, I'm getting that same thing.
- Yes?
- And I see it.
- Yes?
It's by a body of water.
Really?
It's by a body of water?
Leikin, that's amateur stuff.
You know what, I might expect that from John Edwards.
Definitely from Miss Cleo.
But not from you.
- Leikin - Wait.
I'm also I'm also getting something in French.
A sign, maybe?
- Could it be a European hotel?
- Wait a minute.
She may be on to something.
I know this particular hotel.
It's on my sales route.
On a private beach - What?
- It's just it's strange.
I'm I'm pretty familiar with your route, Gus.
I don't recall any private beaches with hotels on them.
- What are you talking about, Shawn?
- Where was it you went last summer for the Pips autograph signing convention?
- You met Gladys Knight?
- No.
- Just the Pips.
- Actually, a Pip.
The other two got stuck in traffic.
Look, I don't wanna talk about it.
The point is, it's been under construction for months.
Which would account for the noise.
And it caters to Europeans.
- This could be the place.
- Sweet.
We totally scored.
But you couldn't have got that without my transient location thing, am I right?
I don't I don't think that cake is cooked.
Listen, I need to know every guest cashed in the last week.
I'm sorry, who are you, and what do you want?
Special Agent Lars Ewing.
Federal Treasury Department.
Head Detective Carlton Lassiter, Santa Barbara Police Department.
Presidential Recommendation for Distinguished Service.
Presidential Physical Fitness award.
Eighth, ninth, and tenth grade.
And I've got a cocktail napkin from Air Force One.
I personally arrested Ivan Boesky.
I wrestled in high school.
- What, with your conscience?
- That is it!
Look, we need to know who's paid with cash or travelers checks recently.
My God, you're a firecracker.
It would probably be easier to ask who didn't.
I'm sorry?
This is a hotel.
We're a cash business.
Lots of European travelers.
With what foreign credit card companies charge these days, cash is king.
The south tower, I see him.
I see him in the south tower.
How many rooms in the south tower?
There are 170.
All right, let's start banging on some doors and call for backup.
If we tap every available source of manpower, we can have this thing done I can alert Washington right now and have an 80-man SWAT team on a C-130 Hercules.
They could be here in less than three hours.
Filthy sheets!
I see dirty, filthy sheets.
Yes, and towels on the floor.
And a mediocre, half-eaten turkey club sandwich.
And he's refused maid service.
Okay, what guest refused maid service?
I might remind you we do cater to a very European crowd.
He's isolated.
He's in a less-desirable room that's not facing the ocean.
Do you have any rooms that face the parking lot?
A few.
- He's in one of those.
- Let's see.
French woman.
Another French party.
Here here's a single gentleman.
Paid all in cash.
Corner room facing the alley.
And according to this, he's never taken his "do not disturb" sign off his door.
- Room number.
- Key!
Clear!
Nice job, psychics, let's get to work.
That's a really cute front-loader.
Thank you.
He prints the money, then he washes it here to soften it.
Then he tumbles it dry and beats it up with stones to give it that natural, worn texture.
Dude, there's linen fibers in that paper.
What was he doing, amending the constitution?
You can't print money on regular paper, Shawn.
That's government-issue.
I'm getting a visual.
He printed a batch of about 50.000, which will last him a while.
Five bills a sheet, at least 80 sheets missing from this ream that sounds about right.
- Wait.
No, I'm getting more.
I'm getting a lot more.
Like 500.000, which would last more than just a while.
Maybe maybe a whole lifetime.
- That's not possible.
- It is if you live in one of the Baltic states.
I'm just not getting that feeling at all.
Anything over 50.000 is just getting blocked from my receptors.
Not a chance.
Receptors?
Really?
This would do it.
This is a 500-sheet ream, and it's likely he used it all.
Treasury seal?
No.
Passport seal.
Uh, this guy's officially on the lam.
We don't catch him now, we can kiss him good-bye.
The railway stations, obviously the airport security has been notified, and all the interstate agencies are on alert.
They've all been given the sketch based on Ms. Leikin's description of the suspect.
Okay, but please keep your phones on just in case we get any movement.
What's the point?
Nobody ever bothers to call us anymore.
Shawn, I don't do this much, but I just wanted to say thank you.
I know we haven't nailed him yet, but you were right, we make a good team.
Yes, we do.
And hopefully tomorrow we'll wrap this thing up.
Have a good night.
Wait for it Wait for it.
Shawn, I was thinking maybe we could go somewhere now.
Maybe continue working to see if we can't stumble upon some collective apparition.
That's a fantastic idea.
I love it.
Where could we go at this hour that's still open?
You know what, I think there's a Color Me Mine that stays open late.
- You don't quit with the jokes, do you?
- I'm sorry, would you like me to stop?
Not yet.
I kinda like it.
But actually, I was thinking back to my hotel room?
You know, it's something we could try.
I mean, it's not as much fun as making ashtrays with our names on them, but Yeah.
I'm a flexible guy, a sportsman.
Good.
All right, I'll head back to freshen up.
What do you say we meet at 2200 hours?
Perfect.
Oh, I'm so rude.
Gus, buddy, would you like to join us?
- Well, I - That sucks, so 2200 on the dot.
I'll be there.
Dude, what time is 2200 hours?
Gus.
Buddy, help me out.
What is it?
Is it, like, 11:00 times two?
Buddy!
So, tell me, Shawn.
Are you planning on doing psychic police work forever?
No.
No, just until I find the girl of my dreams.
And then I'll whisk her off to Carmel and Open a small haberdashery Do some macrame, maybe.
Maybe blow some glass.
Well, as hot as that sounds, I think the psychic world would miss your talents.
Just make sure they appreciate you.
After a while, the world tends to take people with our abilities for granted.
Well, that's awfully easy for you to say.
I mean, you've already met your special someone Your handsome prince.
You're serious with somebody, remember?
Actually, I recently had a change of heart.
- Really?
Would a certain psychic have anything to do with that?
Well, we do have quite a connection.
We do.
It's It's like our minds are just fused together, you know?
I feel like Holly Hunter in Broadcast News, you know, when she's inside William Hurt's head?
Okay, let's try it.
I'm thinking of something.
- None they don't bury the survivors.
- Yes, exactly.
You have a favorite color, and I'm seeing sea foam green.
Actually, it's blue, but that is so near the green family.
- Pick a number between one and ten.
- Eight.
That's close enough.
- You totally wanted me to do that.
- You totally read my mind.
# Dissolve the nerves that have just begun # # Listening to Marvin # # All night long # # This is the sound # # of my soul # # This is the sound # Whoa, slow down.
What do you mean she took off when?
You know, I don't know when.
She tricked me, okay?
She clearly wants to take all the credit for herself.
Look, just just meet me over here.
Oh, that's Lassie on the other line.
I gotta take it.
- You're dropping me for Lassiter?
- Hurry up!
You wait till now to call us?
I called you as soon as I heard.
Do you think I want Junior G-man here to beat me to the punch.
Thank you.
Well, it's affirmative our counterfeiter.
Shot with his own gun there are signs of a struggle.
Checks out as Steven J. Grabinski.
His only priors are a couple counts of petty theft, and small-time fraud in Washington.
He had a small scar, about three inches on the jaw line, and He wore a single stud diamond in his left ear.
Damn, she's good.
Whoa touchy!
I don't know how you do it in Washington, but here, we don't disturb the body till forensics has a chance to come in, collect some evidence.
- Lassiter, ease up.
We're lucky if our psychic doesn't lick the body.
Well I guess congratulations are in order.
We have to hand it to our federal agents here.
Though we would have preferred to bring him in and charge him, this case looks pretty much wrapped up.
There's no need to congratulate us for doing what is our job.
We don't ask for commendation for what is merely our proud honor of servitude to our country.
Perhaps just a small hug.
Just an itty-bitty one.
I'm serious.
Too much?
So how'd you sleep?
Well, I guess I was right about one thing.
It turned out to be a pretty good week for you.
Look, I'm sorry, Shawn.
I don't know what you want me to say to you.
I don't know either.
You lost a case.
You lose.
She's on the winning side, you're on the losing side.
She's the winner, you're the loser.
You know, dad, had I made a list of things I did want to hear, that wouldn't even have made the top eight.
Something is really off with this cake.
But, Shawn, you want my advice, I think you should quit.
- What?
- You should quit.
That's what you do.
When things get tough, somebody's better than you, you quit.
- Where is this even coming from?
- Oh, come on, Shawn, I've got 80 examples sitting on the tip of my tongue.
Eighth grade you quit the bassoon when Bobby Nowocinski beat you out for the solo in the winter festival.
Let me get this straight.
You have an example from eighth grade sitting on the tip of your tongue?
Shawn, the point is, a year from now, you won't even be working for the Santa Barbara Police Department.
- You don't know that.
- All right, look, Shawn, now I'm gonna tell you something that you do want to hear.
I accept you for who you are.
- Is that a fact?
- That is a fact.
You don't have to prove anything to me.
I'm gonna let you off the hook.
Now, how's that feel, better?
Now you can go ahead, and you can quit this too.
First of all and I think I can say this now with a fair amount of certainty there's definitely something not right about this cake.
Maybe because it was baked with a child's oven.
We're talking about a deluxe Easy-Bake Oven, Gus.
I paid over $300 for it on eBay.
This is hardly a toy.
Okay, I didn't major in psychology, but I'm gonna guess this doesn't have anything to do with the cake.
I'm sorry.
It's got nothing to do with you or me or my dad or the cake.
It's got a little something to do with the cake.
But it's mostly about Lindsay showing us up on this case.
She's either a crazy-good psychic, or she's just a better detective than me.
Hey, I thought you had her back at the hotel when you surprised her with that $500.000 thing.
I'm getting more I'm getting a lot more.
Like 500.000, which would last more than just a while.
- Maybe a whole lifetime.
- That's not possible.
I did have her.
I totally had her.
Come on!
Mildred, you kept a record of everything that was said in this investigation.
Am I right?
If someone as little as burped, I got it down.
- There's a symbol for burp?
- Terrific.
I need you to clarify something for me.
Two days ago, in the morning, outside the Home Depot center.
Ewing and Leikin making small talk.
Can you read that back?
- What was that, 0700 hours?
- No, no, it was 7:00 a. m. Here's something.
Ewing: "Do you know of a good chocolatier"?
Leikin: "I had someone in Seattle, specialized in hazelnut praline stuff very good".
- It was just after that.
- Something about the dye used in public swimming pools to identify urine?
- No.
- The musical Wicked?
- No.
- Something about coffee?
- Yes, that's it.
Mildred, could you read the coffee thing?
Ewing: "You breached protocol, Leikin.
I waited for you outside the hotel, "Yeah, sorry, I got up early and went to grab coffee".
Mildred, where are Ewing and Leikin now?
Where I'm supposed to be catching a chartered flight back to Washington.
- I'm late.
- Not a problem.
We'll give you a ride.
We happen to be headed that way.
That's great.
- Mildred, here, say this.
- Shotgun.
Tough luck, buddy.
Well, folks You all did a nice job on this investigation.
So, uh you have a MySpace page or something?
Whoa, Lindsay, Lindsay, Lindsay!
Wait, wait, wait!
I just wanted to make sure I had an opportunity to congratulate you, you know, personally.
- Thank you.
It's not necessary.
- No, no, no, it is necessary.
You did it.
You cracked it.
I mean, you deserve all the credit You're amazing.
She's an amazing person.
Look, Shawn, don't feel too bad.
- There'll be other cases.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
I know.
But not for you.
You see It all started when you identified the scar on the jaw line of our counterfeiter, along with his little diamond-stud earring.
I mean, I couldn't even draw a hair color.
So there's no way that you could do that unless Unless you'd already seen him before.
- This is ridiculous.
- Is it?
It's not like I'm wearing a giant moose costume.
I had a vision you were drinking coffee.
- Oh, congratulations.
- But not at the hotel.
You were driving past one Starbucks, two Starbucks, 17 Starbucks, and ended up all the way in Goleta.
On the very same day that Grabinski's Lamborghini was spotted just outside of town in Anybody?
- Special?
- Goleta.
That's right.
Goleta.
The two of you were partners and you were in touch the whole time.
What's more, they were lovers in the night.
I'm seeing somebody.
I didn't think it was possible to fall in love with somebody in the span of five minutes.
She got us so close to the counterfeiter a month ago in Wilmette, Illinois.
Probably just missed him by five minutes.
That's when you met him.
You didn't miss him.
She had him.
She had your bad boy red-handed.
Suddenly you were much more interested in combining forces and making a whole lot of money.
And it was going well.
It was going very well Until you blew it.
You know which moment I'm talking about, right?
The one in the hotel room.
When you realized he had printed way more than the 50,000 that you'd planned.
And the passport?
So you called him that morning, you met him at the warehouse.
It was you who struggled with him.
And it was you who shot him dead.
Only then, having your vision that miraculously led everyone here to the crime scene.
Oh, come on.
I mean, I've seen poor losers before, but this is just sad.
Your DNA was all over him.
But you covered your tracks by touching the body in front of everybody before forensics had a chance to come in and brush it.
Or comb it.
Braid it.
- Maybe put it in pigtails.
- Shawn!
That only leaves one outstanding issue.
And that is Where's the rest of the money?
Wait a minute.
What's happening?
What's happening to me?
I've heard about this.
It's called spontaneous psychic krav maga.
Oh, my, it's the bag.
Something's in the bag!
It's bad.
It's very bad.
And it could be embarrassing.
Well, you were wrong about one thing, Shawn.
I didn't sleep with you because you were my enemy.
I did it because I really thought we had something.
Okay.
First of all, a little discretion would be nice.
All right?
I mean, these are These are my co-workers.
Secondly, anything we had, you ruined.
Because you betrayed your gift, Leikin.
You give a bad name to psychics like me who pride themselves on the purity of that gift.
There are so many people out there who already doubt what we do.
Now you've given 'em all a reason to think that we're fakes.
You sicken me I'm sickened.
I mean, sure, I'm still wildly attracted to you on the physical level, but spiritually and psychically, you're dead to me.
Gun!
I'm taking him and I'm taking the plane.
This is not what it looks like.
Okay, they're just processing Ms. Leikin's arrest before we put her back on a plane to Washington.
It'd be great if you guys could give me this paperwork as soon as possible.
Got it.
Lassiter spilled a cup of coffee on me and right before I was supposed to get on the plane.
Thankfully I keep an extra crisp, white shirt on me.
Government issue, folds up to the size of my wallet.
Fits in my back pocket.
Gotta love those boys in the Gadget Tech Department.

My bike's twice as good as his.
Yeah, well you see, that's the thing, Shawn.
Sure, your bike looks great with all these ridiculous reflectors and gadgets from years' worth of cereal box tops, but Gus here focused on what's important: hard work.
I'm sorry son, but he just out-pedaled you.
- Do you understand?
- I think so.
I got it!
I had the wrong song playing that time.
Best two out of three.
I know what you're trying to do, Shawn.
And it's not gonna work.
I'm not buying.
Oh, it's on now.
On three.
One two - Let go of my chair, Shawn.
The wheels!
- They're stuck together!
- Listen, you two - Did you see who won?
- I beat him, didn't I?
- No, no, no.
- Two out of three.
- Ha, that means I beat him, right?
Unlike everyone else around here, I'm not fooled by the fact that you wear grown-up clothes have mastered the rudimentary levels of communication and, somehow, manage to feed yourselves.
I see you for what you are: children.
So do me a favor and let the grown-ups do their work.
I got a boo-boo.
Speaking of boo-boos, you wouldn't happen to have any extra unsolved cases lying around, would you?
Spencer, there is just no easy way to tell you that I consider you a waste of this department's time and energy.
I guess there was an easy way.
But actually I've got less patience for you today than normal.
See, I received an invitation to give a presentation at 21-LES.
Enforcement Seminar?
Yes.
We know that better as "21 Saint Cent-Les.
" I like to call it Go ahead make jokes.
But we just did.
You see, kids, I will be presenting the cutting edge technology.
Modern tools for the new detective.
We're talking back-scatter x- ray scanning, DNA sampling, sonic weaponry, you name it, I am That's weird.
I could have sworn that I - I don't believe it.
- Don't believe what?
My car, it's gone.
It was right there.
It's It's been stolen.
- Who would dare steal my car?
- Well, here's the good news.
It'll make for an amusing anecdote during your presentation at 21 Saint Cent-Les.
# I know you know # # That I'm not telling the truth # # I know you know # # They just don't have any proof # # Where's the deception?
# # Learn how to bend # # Your worst inhibitions # # Tend to psych you out in the end # All right, just keep your mouth shut.
I don't want people to think anything's wrong.
Morning, O'Conell.
Schwartz.
Dobson.
Just rapping with the fellas, shooting the breeze.
Sweet, now they'll just think it's 1974.
Wait a minute.
Is is this a prank?
Did you take my car?
Is this some sort of "punking"?
To think that we would stoop so low as to tamper with police-issued property, and defile the institution that is the Santa Barbara police department, is an affront to our honor.
I for one, am greatly offended.
And I, for two.
I just don't see how this could have happened.
Did you?
- Wait!
I'm getting something.
- What, Shawn?
What is it?
It's a trace on Lassie's car.
It's faint, but clear.
You were recently somewhere where the security of your car was compromised.
I'm sensing someplace posh.
Surprisingly upscale for someone on half a civil servant's salary.
As it happens, I dined at a very exclusive restaurant last night.
The type of restaurant one would take a date to?
Is old Lassie back in the game?
It is non of your business with whom I spend my personal time.
Now you have to dish.
She blonde?
- Brunette?
- Mail order?
You sly dog.
Please, I'm not gonna engage in some sort of juvenile masculinity contest.
- He went by himself.
- Yeah.
Her name was Polly Smith.
- We kissed.
Ask her.
- Polly Smith?
Something happened at that restaurant that led to your car being stolen.
I'm sensing red coats.
And accents.
- The British?
- No.
The valets.
Check the valet departure car.
He may have used the old "key in the putty" trick to get an impression.
Of course, that would have been my first deduction, had I not been overcoming this blatant violation.
I'm gonna get right over there.
- No, oh.
- No car, remember?
You guys are so funny.
Oh, guess what.
I just got a new car.
Yours.
Maybe we had a little too much fun with him.
Maybe.
I have to pee-pee.
May I help you, gentleman?
The theft of police property has occurred.
I have reason to believe the guilty party works here.
Oh, dear.
Well, rest assured you have our complete cooperation.
I only ask that you keep your investigation under wraps.
You know, for appearance sake.
Noted.
Now, I'm gonna need to sequester your main dinning room interview your entire valet staff, and possibly your busboys.
One moment.
- Yeah, he's gonna be a problem.
- I don't know.
- He seemed pretty cooperative.
- Your work here is done.
I'll get my car back soon enough.
Here.
But I'm warning you, if word of this little incident gets out of the station, I will start making things very difficult for you down there.
You're saying you haven't even been trying?
All this time?
Good-bye.
He's not gonna get anywhere talking to those valets.
They have a very strict code.
I still think you're thinking about the British.
May have to roll my sleeves up for this one, Gus.
Actually, I may have to take off my entire shirt.
Please don't.
Oh, later.
Hi there.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm the head psychic for the Santa Barbara police department.
And I may need to get a statement from you.
More specifically, the word "yes.
" Nice try.
But I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.
That's all right.
If my parents were visiting, I probably wouldn't wanna waste time meeting handsome new strangers either.
Regardless of how smart or interesting they might be.
My parents are visiting.
That was pretty impressive.
You really are psychic.
Sorry, I thought you were just hitting on me.
Oh, I'm actually much more interested in going out with your parents.
I love the Miniatures Museum.
What was it you need to ask me about?
Do you recall any uh suspicious behavior from any of the valets on duty last night?
Now that you mention it, we had a new guy who started yesterday, - but didn't show up this morning.
- Bingo.
Gonna need a name and a phone number.
Of course.
And then I'll give you the information about the valet.
Get this.
The valet's number is actually a number to a pay phone outside of a warehouse.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know if it looks like the warehouse from Blue City, Gus.
You're the only one that rembers that movie.
What, are you insane?
Way more people saw from The Hipthan Blue City Look, I'm not gonna talk Judd Nelson right now.
No, just just meet me at the station in an hour.
Thank you.
A warehouse?
Sweet!
There's always something happening on the DL inside a warehouse.
You staked it out, right?
I know you staked it out.
Oh, it got staked.
Stook.
Staken?
- Staked, right?
- Right.
Yeah, yeah it got staked.
You found out what happened to Lassiter's car?
A whole bunch of cars go in, but only boxes full of car parts come out.
Dude, it's a chop shop.
That's big.
Victims I see victims everywhere!
It's horrible!
Sawed-off parts strewn about.
Fluids spraying in every direction.
Oh, dear God!
Are we talking about a serial killer?
I can see the victims' names.
Accord, look out!
Get outta there!
Escalade, don't let him in the door.
- Oh, Camry, you were too young to go!
- Are we talking about cars?
- Stolencars?
- The signal's too strong.
I'm getting "chop sticks.
" - "Chopped salad?
- What?
- "Chop suey"?
- Good God!
"Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch.
" Does that mean anything to you?
"Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch.
" - Chop shop!
It's a chop shop.
- Yes!
And and I see a warehouse.
And cargo containers.
And a street sign.
And a little mouse named Algernon in a maze.
Flower Street!
Flower Street that's down by the tracks.
We better check this out.
You know you just bought that, right?
Looks like a slam dunk, Mr. Spencer.
Wally there is the ringleader.
And all the evidence we need to take him down is right here.
I mean, stolen parts, serial numbers, shipment logs - You name it.
- No need to thank me, Chief.
Just glad to help.
Don't thank him either.
Well, if I can't thank you I can't pay you.
- Our pleasure.
- Oh, you're very welcome.
You are.
You know, this ring was responsible for hundreds of car thefts around town.
Wally had operatives in places mechanics, valets, car wash attendants all copying people's keys and then stealing their cars from different locations.
Does it say anything in there about them stealing loose change or switching the presets on radios?
'Cause that happens to me all the time.
Okay, Gus.
Go ahead and put your aluminum foil hat back on.
I'm not paranoid, Shawn.
It happens.
Anyway, I believe this is a department record for the fastest bust ever in a case this size.
Truly your most efficient work.
Oh, stop.
That's so unnecessary.
You know, I couldn't help but notice that a certain vehicle belonging to a certain head detective just happens to not be here.
Lassie, we had the boys from crime scene move your car up the street right before you and the Chief arrived.
You're in the clear, tiger.
Thanks.
Although today is a street sweeping day.
Did we park on the east side or the west side of the street?
- North side.
- No, no, no.
It wasn't the north side.
Yes, it was.
I'd know, Shawn.
I'm good with directions.
You're not.
Gus, you have the bearings of a wounded bumblebee.
Why would We need to get out of here.
Well, you're certainly a unique guy, Shawn.
A guy who calls the day he gets the number.
- And brings flowers.
- I stole the flowers.
From table one.
They're fake, and they smell vaguely of creamy pesto, but I'm pretty sure it's the thought that counts.
And you're good enough to come and meet me here my last free night before my parents arrive.
Oh, wrapping up this case was a lot easier than I thought.
And this is one of the biggest strawberries I've ever seen.
Impressive.
I've been here all day.
So what do you say we take our dessert back to my place?
I say yes.
Was this too easy?
I beg your pardon?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
Never mind.
I can't believe how quickly I nailed this.
- Am I really this good?
- Excuse me?
I mean, is it possible that no.
No, nothing like this has ever happened before.
And nothing's going to happen tonight either.
How dare you think that I'm easy?
Good-bye.
What no.
No, no, no.
I'm not talking about you.
This is this is something much worse.
This is the first time I've been wrong about a case.
Gus, I'm telling you, it was too easy.
Why would this Wally guy slip up by stealing a detective's car from in front of a police station?
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Sure it does.
One of his guys got sloppy.
Gus, I'm pretty sure I saw him smile as they loaded him into the squad car.
What, he thinks going to prison is dope?
No, come on.
I think I solved the crime I was supposed to solve.
Not the crime I should've solved.
Okay, you're not making any sense.
And I happen to be busy, so if you don't mind?
What are you doing?
What is this?
What, are you going somewhere?
Yes, actually, I am.
I finally have a free weekend.
Which means I get to use the Spa Utopia package I won for being top sales rep.
It comes complete with town car and driver.
Gus, you've been bragging about that award for over a year why go now?
Maybe I kept pushing it back because I was always working a second job.
Like when I had to enter a Civil War reenactment?
Or when I was protecting a sorority of pajama-clad coeds.
You're actually complaing about that?
No, I'm not.
But let's not forget about the entire week I gave up riding shotgun to a cat, which, by the way, was not a boy cat at all.
That's some serious stress, Shawn.
I have to get a deep-tissue massage to work out all the knots in my back.
I call the big one "Little Shawn.
" Okay, that's the creepiest thing anyone's ever said to me.
They have a blind masseuse up there named Gloria.
I hear she works wonders.
I can't wait.
What is it with you and the blind?
I remember you went crazy for that blind sculptor that did your bust.
That was Lionel Richie in the video for Hello.
Great.
Now I'm gonna have that song stuck in my head.
Good.
Good-bye, Shawn.
Chief!
We gotta reopen the chop shop case.
I'm pretty sure we missed something.
First of all, "we" don't decide to reopen cases.
I do.
That's what I meant.
- Morning, Chief.
- Morning.
Uh, Lassiter, Mr. Spencer seems to think we might have missed something in the chop shop case.
No no, that's an open-and-shut case if ever I've seen one.
Sorry, Mr. Spencer, but if you want to reopen the case, you're gonna need to come up with some concrete evidence.
We don't devote department resources to personal whims.
Carlton, I finished the PowerPoint slides for your 21-LES presentation.
This is official department business?
Oh, you're right, Helvetica is I know see how the M in "double murder suicide" just jumps off the page?
Okay.
Is there anyone left that I can actually speak to about this case?
Like I said, there's still quite a few unanswered questions.
Well, what can I say?
You guys got me fair and square.
That's just it.
What kind of chop shop artist steals a cop's car and doesn't chop it up?
It's almost like you wanted to leave a trail.
Leave a trail, don't leave a trail, wouldn't do any good.
You guys caught me quick.
Snap!
Mind of a cheetah.
I was like, "What"?
Cops are like, wham!
Miranda.
Yeah, well, there's still some questions.
For instance, why haven't you posted bail, Wally?
Oh, it's all good.
You know, I'am just do my time.
With good behavior.
And go on with my life.
Till then, I'm like,"My bad"!
The court's like, "Get in that cell.
" Justice.
Okay.
Let's try this again.
Prisoner 1906, visiting time is over.
Gotta go.
Your massage therapist will be right with you, Mr. Guster.
In the meantime, please relax.
And hydrate.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, do you mind?
Shawn, what are you doing here?
Sorry.
Shawn, what are you doing here?
Trust me.
The way today's going, I need to relax too.
I can't get the Chief to reopen the case.
I already I already told you I'm not helping you either.
- You will when you hear this.
- What?
I visited Wally.
In prison.
- You went to the pen?
- I went to the joint.
You went to the clink?
According to the visitors' log, the only other person who dropped by to see Wally was Jonny G. Who turns out to be the Jonny G. of Jonny G.'s Bling it On Custom Auto Shop.
- So all he's guilty of is a bad pun?
- Hardly.
First Wally gets arrested for running a chop shop, then he gets visited by Jonny G., who works in custom auto parts.
Adds a whole new angle to the case, Gus.
Look, is Jonny G. dirty too?
What's the G stand for?
Is Wally working for him?
What other criminal nonsense are they up to?
Man, we may have just uncovered the tip of the iceberg here.
- That's all you've got?
- That and this.
It burns.
Sitting here listening to you right now, Little Shaw just got bigger.
I beg your pardon.
- No thanks.
- Fine.
What time are you seeing that blind chick?
Gloria can't see me.
Dude, I know how being blind works.
I mean she's booked, Shawn.
I had to book with this girl named Kelly.
I hope she's good.
Mr. Guster.
Are you ready for your massage?
- Kelly?
- Call me Kel.
Um you know what, Kel?
I forgot I have another appointment I have to go to.
Uh thanks for your time.
Dude.
That dude's shoulders looked like two little baby heads.
I know.
Okay, I'll help.
But I must be back in two hours.
That's when I booked the isolation chamber.
Sweet.
We'll take your town car.
You're not naked under there, are you?
Naked and unashamed.
Man I'll be outside.
How are we gonna get this information out of Jonny G.?
The dude thinks we're customers, Gus.
It's a perfect cover.
I don't get it.
Who wastes money tricking out a car?
It's frivolous and ridiculous.
Not to mention it compromises the integrity of the vehicle.
Yo, Shawn!
Yo, lookin' good, man.
- Wassup, homie?
- Jonny G., how are ya?
- Good, man.
- This is my friend, Ovaltine Jenkins.
Oh, respect, a'ight?
What's up, O?
- What's happening?
- Peace, man.
Yo, check it out.
Your ride is fresh to death.
Always do the last checks myself, you know what I mean?
Just to make sure it meets specs.
You know what I mean?
- I do know what you mean.
- You know what I mean?
What ride?
This one.
My car!
- Shawn!
- I told you it was the perfect cover.
That is fresh to death.
This is a company car, Shawn.
- I have to visit clients in this.
- Would you relax?
I can't believe you spent all our money from the chop shop case on this.
What?
You couldn't find any magic beans?
A "Jack and the Beanstalk" reference?
Really?
- You wasted our money.
- I reinvested it in the business, Gus.
Once we figure out what's up with Jonny G.'s shop and re-solve the case, we'll get another check.
And you want to know what we are going to do with it?
- Party like it's 1999.
- No, we're gonna - Party.
- Shawn.
- Karamu?
- No!
- Fiesta?
- We're gonna spend that money turning my car back to the way it was.
All right.
But I still don't see why you won't drive it like this.
- Because!
It's embarrassing.
- Embarrassing?
Dude, this is sweet.
This is fresh to death.
You won't enjoy it, I will.
What's up, ladies?
Nice ride.
That's hot.
Thank you.
You're hot!
You are so hot!
Get out of my seat.
- You said you didn't want to drive.
- It's my ride, Shawn.
I'm driving.
Just get us to the station.
I gotta convince the Chief to let us snoop around Jonny G.'s operations.
What now?
I'm gonna need your license and regis I I didn't know it was you guys.
Sorry, but in this car, you just happen to fit a profile.
I'm really sorry to bother you guys.
Mauler!
Heel!
Heel!
Now I'm really, really sorry.
He's just a trainee for K9 unit.
Obviously, he's not gonna make it.
Sorry again, fellas.
And Gus?
Mauler barks at all cars.
Not just blue ones.
Carlton, it's here!
Is this the new nanomaterial vest we ordered for 21-LES?
Yes, it's gonna kill.
"The KEV-TEK 7000 is made with nanomaterial polymers that give it enough strength to stop a tank mortar shell.
" I can't wait to try it out.
Oh, no, no, no.
Last time, you got to be incapacitated by the sonic gun.
Now it's my turn.
- Let go, O'Hara.
- Oh, come on.
Drop it!
- Just let me try it - You know I've had just about enough of the two of you.
You can both be shot.
Just sign the waivers.
Sonny was a cuckoo bird.
Clearly he was cuckoo for something.
- Cocoa Puffs.
- Exactly.
- I always thought it was Cuckoo Puffs.
- No Sonny is cuckoo for the puffs, which are coco.
That's why the milk turns all brown and chocolatey.
I was never allowed to eat that stuff when I was a kid.
That's why I don't have any cavities.
- So, are we having cereal?
- Yes.
But I'm getting more.
9459687.
- Are these serial numbers?
- Yes, but there's more.
I see shiny rims.
Spoilers.
Hammered rims.
Spencer, is this about the chop shop?
- 'Cause we told you the case is closed.
- Now, hold on this is very specific information.
O'Hara, run the numbers by the crime lab, just to make sure we didn't miss anything in the sweep.
And you better not be wasting department time, Mr. Spencer.
Because if you are, we'll be using these new vests on you.
- That's a great idea.
- Thank you.
Because that way, it's a plus for me whether they work or fail.
It better not take long for Juliet to run those numbers.
It won't.
I already missed all of yesterday on this already-solved case.
This is my last day to enjoy my vacation.
You don't realize how much stress I've been on these past few I'm not playing, Shawn.
I never get to do anything for myself.
I'm getting that massage.
And yes, I'll be naked and unashamed under my robe while they rub Little Shawn down!
Wait!
It wasn't like that!
Jules, what do you got on those serial numbers?
Well, the good news is, they tracked them to car parts.
The bad news is, the parts were purchased legitimately for Bling it On.
And the even worse news is that Lassiter wants to know what size vest you wear.
Very funny.
Thanks for making my life more challenging.
- The car parts at the shop were legit?
- Looks that way.
There must be something else going on down there that we're missing.
Besides selling stolen car parts.
We gotta get back down there and look for clues.
I don't know about you, but I'm still on vacation.
Looks like something's wrong with your in-dash DVD navigation and integrated surround sound system.
That was my speedometer.
Now I can't see how fast I'm going.
Regardless, we've gotta take it back to Jonny G. to fix.
Hey, dude.
Is Jonny G. around?
Uh, don't know.
We've been busy.
- What you working on there?
- Getting this fleet ready to ship to Arizona.
Okay, thanks.
And stealth mode.
- What are we looking for, anyway?
- Anything that points to criminal activity.
You know a white cloth sack with a green dollar sign.
A red barrel labeled "TNT".
An anvil.
Anything.
- Check this out.
- What, you already have something?
The point of those examples was to imply it wouldn't be so obvious.
Look how light it is.
Awesome.
Flavor Flav can wear it around his neck.
Flav wears clocks, not rims, Shawn.
Why don't you put your phone on vibrate?
Dad, this is not a good Okay, relax.
I will be right there.
- We gotta go.
- Go?
We either need to be working on this case, or I need to be back on my vacation.
He said he needed me there immediately.
I've never heard him sound this urgent.
I hope everything's okay.
Here.
Scale.
- This was the urgent emergency?
- Yeah..
Gotta get these on the grill before it's too late.
I can't believe you had me rush down here for this, Dad.
I thought something was actually wrong with you.
- What's wrong with you?
- You remember how to scale, - don't you, Shawn?
- Yes, I remember how to scale.
You only made me do it A kid who didn't believe in animal cruelty, by the way.
Those animals would've killed you dead, given the means.
All right, you scrape the scales, you don't bruise the flesh, you make an incision around the gill, - and you fillet - Down the spine.
Very good.
You do remember.
And Gus, you remember where the bathroom is.
You're taking me away from very important work right now.
I'll have you know I'm on the verge of uncovering something big, really big.
Huge.
Did you ever have a case you couldn't crack?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Of course.
More than a few.
But a good detective learns the most when he doesn't get the bad guy.
- No, I got the bad guy.
- Oh, well, sometimes he gets off.
But a good detective doesn't let that get him down.
No, he's still in jail.
Matter of fact, Chief Vick even says it's my best work.
All right, then what's the problem?
It doesn't feel like my best work, you know?
It feels too easy.
Did you ever have that problem?
No, Shawn, I don't recall any champagne problems like things being too easy.
I don't know, I guess I just imagined my best work would be more complicated, you know?
More Intricate, important, and Just more, you know, more.
As always, you go after something for the flash, for the excitment.
And when you finally get it, you're never satisfied.
- It always needs something more.
- That is categorically untrue.
Your best case, what does it need?
It needs more excitement.
Your first bike, what did it need?
More reflectors Well, Shawn, did you ever stop and think that maybe it's your expectations that need to change?
Son, look at me.
Look, Shawn.
Sometimes, a case is just a case.
He's just a trainee for K9 unit.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
I just figured it out.
Wait, wait, don't Shawn, don't do this.
Oh, this is much bigger than we thought.
- And I was right all along.
- Shawn, don't you dare don't you dare learn a wrong lesson while I'm trying to teach you a right lesson!
Look how light it is.
Getting this fleet ready to ship to Arizona.
Stop it stop stop stop trying to figure it out.
- Stop jumping!
- I can't help it!
It all makes sense!
Gus, we gotta go!
- I'll explain on the way.
- Shawn, Shawn!
You should be happy with a job well done, regardless of the excitement that it produces.
Is that it?
Yeah, that's it.
Is it a tight knot right under the shoulder blade?
Yeah, how'd you know?
Gus!
Jonny G. is smuggling drugs out of state inside a car parts.
That's why those rims at the office were so light, dude.
They were hollow!
And that's how he gets the drugs out.
And some of that residue must've gotten on your car, which is why that police dog went crazy barking at the wheels.
That's what Wally's been covering for all along.
He's just a fall guy.
Jonny G.'s running the real operation.
Drug trafficking.
We need to make it back to that shop before the evidence leaves for Arizona.
Let's go!
- Damn it, we're too late.
- Somebody's here.
Jonny G.!
Dude!
His foot is still on the accelerator.
Stop!
This isn't funny.
You stop.
I can't!
The nitrous oxide canister's open.
Laughing gas?
That stuff is deadly in high doses.
At least we know what the cause of death is.
I can't believe Jonny G. went out like that.
The police suspect foul play.
But so far, they have no leads.
All while I was on lockdown?
Guess I ended up with a better sentence than Jonny G. did.
Irony.
We still have a few questions.
What do you know about a shipment of custom cars on its way to Arizona?
We were partners, but Jonny G. was involved in a lot of stuff I didn't know about.
If I asked questions, he'd be like, "Nunya.
" I'd be like, "Okay".
Relegate.
So so you're saying you weren't involved with the custom car shop at all?
I'm saying I was just a front man for the chop shop.
And now I'm doing my time.
But when I get out, crime's gonna be like, "Come out and play, Wally.
Come on".
I'm be like, "No".
"Wally doesn't live here anymore".
Reassimilated.
Time's up.
Dude.
I'm starting to think I was wrong about Wally.
When?
The first time or the second time?
Both.
I think he's the mastermind behind this whole drug thing and Jonny G.'s murder.
But Wally was in jail when Jonny G. died.
Yeah.
He made sure of that.
- This is a little awkward.
- Man, let's get outta here.
Wally made it easy for us to catch him because he wanted to get thrown in jail.
That way, he'd be locked up when he murdered Jonny G. Which would give him the perfect alibi.
With Jonny G. out of the way, Wally assumes sole control of the custom car shop.
- And the secret drug operation.
- Hello, motive, my old friend.
Get this.
According to public court records, Wally posted bail this morning.
Why wait until now?
Dude.
Because the big drug deal goes down today.
But we don't know when or where.
Oh, yes, we do.
Yes, we do.
You call Fleet Feat Trucking.
Find out if they're making any custom car deliveries today.
Find out when and where.
I'll go get Jules and Lassie.
Dude, we got this!
As you will see, the tools in the arsenal of the modern-day detective are formidable, to say the least.
Lights, please.
Enjoy.
I pretended to be Jonny G.'s lawyer.
Got the trucking company to tell me that a fleet from Bling it On is expected to be dropped off at 2:30.
I wrote the location down.
This says "In the middle of a field.
" - Why did you have to write that down?
- The address is on the back.
Nice.
We don't We don't have a lot of time.
Lights, please.
Scientific advancements in the mapping of the human genome, in the manipulation of the building blocks of matter itself, have taken law enforcement into the 21st century and beyond.
Thank you.
Thanks very much.
So, are there any questions?
Yes.
I thought you were gonna show us some new law enforcement techniques.
We've seen all these things on CSI.
Well, I can assure you that this technology represents the latest available to police departments.
Oh, now you're onto something, Lassie!
Spencer?
Nobody called for a psychic.
- Psychic?
Awesome!
- I'm getting a reading here.
It's strange.
- Gus, what is this?
- I think you may be magnetized.
Right in the middle of my presentation.
Wait, is he police sanctioned?
Yes.
Yes, he is.
Because we at the Santa Barbara Police Department believe in using every tool in our arsenal to combat crime, and Mr. Spencer here is often under my jurisdiction.
Wait I'm getting a location.
It's an abandoned railroad track, but why?
Please tell me, spirits of cutting-edge law enforcement technology.
I'm getting Michael Douglas.
Catherine Zeta-Jones.
The always under-appreciated Don Cheadle.
- You know that's right.
- Traffic.
Say hello to my little friend!
Uh,Scarface.
They're all movies about drugs!
Yes!
Drugs!
There must be a giant drug deal going down there!
- Right now!
- We can send a squad car over - to check it out.
- Fine.
There's no time!
It's happening in ten minutes.
- We have to go now!
- We can't get there in ten minutes.
I can.
Let's roll.
- Can we come?
- Yes, of course you can come.
You wait out front.
And we'll pull around for you.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Thank you.
Get up against the car.
Turn around!
Up against the car!
Look, we were just having a business transaction.
I was like, "Here are your automotive parts, good sir," and he's like, "Please, take my money.
" Capitalism.
Come on.
Oh, Wally.
Selling custom car parts is legal.
Killing Jonny G. to take over his drug operation not legal.
I'm laughing.
Ha ha ha ha.
Entertained.
Well, we try.
Makes perfect sense, though.
Knowing how much you resented Jonny G. for not including you in the real business down at the shop, huh?
Jonny G. was involved in a lot of stuff I didn't know about.
If I asked questions, he'd be, like, "Nunya".
I'd be like, "Okay".
Relegated.
You figured out a way to take him out and take over his entire enterprise.
You got yourself arrested because you knew that in jail, you'd have the perfect alibi when Jonny G. showed up dead.
Who would dare steal my car?
Brilliantly planned this murder beforehand, knowing that Jonny G. is a creature of habit.
I always do the final checks myself, just to make sure it meets the specs, you know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
That he personally inspects every single car on the day that it's supposed to be delivered, and that he is very, very thorough.
So you figured out which canister of nitrous oxide he'd be using, and rigged it so it would leak when the gauge redlined.
Very creative.
But unlike last time, there's no evidence.
The people's burden.
I'm sorry, Jules, what was that?
Oh, I didn't say anything.
- You didn't say anything?
- No.
Well, who's the chatty Cathy with back there in nothing?
Well, who's who's talking?
Some somebody that saw everything go down.
Wha who who is that?
It's Bessie.
It's Bessie the Mustang.
She's a female Mustang.
That doesn't make any sense.
Technically, that would make her a - what?
- That would be a filly.
A filly, everyone.
Bessie is technically a filly, she I'm sorry, what?
Put his what in your what?
Check inside Bessie's wheels.
- Check inside her wheels.
- Okay, stop.
You don't have a warrant.
That's illegal seizure.
Bill of Rights.
Very suspicious behavior.
Probable cause.
- Nice, Jules.
- It's drugs.
You are under arrest.
But this time, it's for drug trafficking and murder.
Guess that's three strikes.
- Legislated!
- Oh, nice, Gus.
Oh, tell me about it.
- Hey, dude.
- Hey.
Yeah, we'd like to schedule a couple of massages with Gloria.
I'm sorry, but Gloria's still booked.
The only slot she has available is a couples' session.
- No.
- That's fine.
I mean no way.
Thank you.
What's wrong with you?
Dude, you're the one who said she's so amazing.
I figured it was worth it.
Me and you in the same room with just a towel between us?
Not gonna happen.
- She's blind.
- I'm not.
- That's naked and ashamed, Shawn.
- Maybe you're ashamed.
- Naked and ashamed.
- You're ashamed.
I'm not ashamed, Shawn.
- Full of shame.
- I am not!

# and I ran # # I ran so far away # # I just ran # # I ran all night and day # Do you think he saw us?
- What up, dipwads?
- Oh, no, Jimmy Nickles!
Gimme the money.
- Actually, we didn't bring it today.
- Here you go.
- Gus!
- Give it up, Spencer.
Or I'll shove a Jimmy Nickle sandwich right in your grill!
I think it's a knuckle sandwich.
Okay, okay.
And from the kangaroos?
See you tomorrow, butt munches.
It's sloppy joes and tater tots.
You know, Gus, one of these days, we're gonna stand up to Jimmy Nickles.
Yeah, I think I'll stay home sick that day.
It's about time.
Sit down, I have troubling news.
You forgot to Tivo America's Next Top Model, didn't you?
Why is it so hard to set the season pass?
It's not top model related.
- What is it?
- Jimmy Nicholas called.
Jimmy Nickles called us?
From where?
Prison?
I don't think so.
It didn't sound like it.
What does prison sound like?
- Is there singing?
- Shawn!
- I don't know.
He left a message.
- Don't you dare return that call.
I don't need to.
He's coming here in five minutes.
Jimmy Nickles coming here?
- In five minutes?
- Yeah.
We can handle this.
We can handle this.
I'm gonna go print out a fake fore closure notice and stick it on the front door.
And then we both can go outside and scrape the "psych" sign off the front window.
Gus, I think we can afford to relax a little bit.
He said he wants to talk, and by "talk" I hope he means talk, not my head in a toilet.
- He's gonna try and kill us.
- He's not gonna kill us.
Right?
I mean, people change.
We haven't seen him since the fifth grade.
I don't need to see him, Shawn.
Some people are just born evil.
The kid from the Omen, the Children of the corn, Chad Michael Murray.
What is this?
Ooh, ebay!
Auto bid.
A penny The penny's a trick.
I got in a full-on bidding war with a montessori school.
What do we need a locker in the office for?
First of all, I have now here to put my sociology text book.
And You always gotta hit it right on the nose, don't you?
Why couldn't I be Crockett?
Because, Gus.
You stood in front of the entire third grade class and said, "when I grow up, I wanna be - Philip Michael Thomas".
- Well, you said you wanted to be the mascot for the Milwaukee brewers.
Dude, he's the biggest sausage in the world.
Why is Jimmy Nickles coming here, Shawn?
- How big is he now?
- I don't know!
Why couldn't you be a real psychic?
- Hey, you guys in there?
- Oh, god, that's him.
He's not getting my lunch money, I'll tell you that much.
Great, you can terrify him with your wally joyner mini-bat.
Open the door.
What up, boys?
That's a good call with the mini-bat.
# I know you know # # That I'm not telling the truth # # I know you know # # They just don't have any proof # # Where's the deception?
# # Learn how to bend # # Your worst inhibitions # # Tend to psych you out in the end # You d-bags gonna let me in or what?
D- bags?
Yeah, come on in, Jim.
- Way not to be scared, flincher.
- I didn't flinch.
- You know I have a caffeine tic.
- Look at this place.
Video games, lockers.
You two haven't grown up at all, huh?
And you haven't grown up.
Up..
At all.
Jimmy, as glad as we are to see you, what are you doing here?
What do you think I'm doing here, barf beetle?
I came to take your lunch money.
Hand it over!
I'm just messing around.
Actually, I'm in town for, uh, work.
I'm sensing You became a jockey.
A jockey?
Yeah, one of the best jockeys.
Yeah, I won most of my races.
Till this stupid Santa Barbara meet started.
Now I'm on some ridiculous losing streak.
The last three favorites I've ridden have all lost.
And I know it wasn't something I did.
I started to lose all my best mounts.
- Mounts?
- Horses, Guster.
What's wrong with you?
Look, uh, Jimmy, what is it exactly you'd like for us to do?
Well, uh, one of our friends from our old school told me about your company.
Even though it sounds kinda gay, I thought I could hire you to come down to the track and maybe, uh Psychically figure out what's wrong with the horses.
Okay, first of all, you ride on the back of mounts while carrying a whip.
That's much gayer than what we do.
Either way, we're busy right now.
So I don't think we'll be able to - We'll take the case.
- I thought so.
All right, meet me at the track at 2:00.
And as far as anyone else knows, you guys are just some really - good old friends.
- Got it, dillholes?
Got it.
You can count on us dillholes.
Good-bye, Jim.
- Are you crazy?
- I wouldn't say crazy.
Maybe an eccentric who looks good in jeans.
Come on, Gus, you're not actually still afraid of Jimmy Nickles, are you?
We're not helping that little monster, Shawn.
Period.
Okay, so Jimmy's still a jerk.
We can see that.
But the truth is - I feel like I owe him.
- For what?
!
If anything, he owes us for 170 lunches.
You know, I added that up once, and with inflation, that's, like, $1,800.
Look, do you rember when Jimmy got kicked out - of school in the fifth grade?
- For killing a teacher?
For hitting Miss Lepky with a spitball.
- She fell and got hurt.
- Same difference.
She could've very well have been killed.
It was me who ratted him out, Gus.
You did that?
- Why didn't you ever tell me?
- You don't know all my secrets.
I'm a man of untold mysteries.
If he found out, he'd come back - and gnaw off one of my toes.
- Ratting out Jimmy Nickles?
That's suicidal.
I thought I saw him do it, and I told principal tropp, because he said he wasn't gonna let the class go until somebody gave him a name.
And what?
You just had to get home?
Dude, Chips was gonna come on in, like, 20 minutes.
What was I supposed to do?
It was the one with the freeway crash.
Where the car used the empty car carrier trailer as a ramp - and flipped in mid-air.
- That happens in every episode, Shawn.
I was under a lot of pressure.
I always knew you were a kiss-ass.
Who cares?
So Jimmy got kicked out.
It was the best day of my life.
I could finally wear underwear to school again.
I don't know, Gus.
I always sort of felt like I got the wrong guy.
I'll never forget the look on Jimmy's face when they hauled him out of class that day.
I didn't do it!
I promise, I didn't do it!
Look, after Jimmy got kicked out of school, there were all these stories about what happened to him.
He ran away from home, he got thrown in juvenile hall, moved to a small town in Kansas where they out lawed singing and dancing.
That last one is Footloose.
That's a coincidence.
The point is, Jimmy's life changed that day, and I feel like I gotta make it up to him.
Who knows, Gus, I might've stunted the kid's growth.
I don't know, Shawn.
We're talking about the same dude who made Aaron Rencher eat his own retainer.
All right, how about this We take the case, right?
We prove, for all the Aaron Renchers of the world, we are no longer afraid of Jimmy Nickles.
All right, fine.
But if we take this case, we're gonna overcharge him by $1,800.
Done.
He doesn't like the oats.
Or the alfalfa pellets.
They're too chewy for pellets.
Pellets should be crunchy.
They should have a natural crunch to them.
Also, the donkey in stable 11 is a pathological liar.
This is idiotic.
Look, it takes a while for the connection to take hold, Jimmy.
Runny D. And I are just feeling each other out here.
Whatever.
I gotta go lose five pounds before the next race.
You got half an hour to figure out what's going on.
What do you think, Runny D.?
I'll tell you what he's thinking.
He's thinking, "I hate Jimmy.
"He pulled my shorts down in front of jenny scarlatos in the cafeteria".
Are you channeling the horse?
Or a little boy with a tight fade who used to wear his O.P.'S without a drawstring?
The horse, Shawn.
I didn't have a tight fade in the third grade.
How are you?
That's interesting.
This place is weird and borderline depressing.
I mean, who are these people?
Who actually comes here?
Well, well, well.
This I never thought I'd see.
Wow, dad.
Tell me you're wearing that shirt because someone has to spot you from space.
Very funny, Shawn.
This happens to be one of my lucky track shirts.
I like it.
I'd like it too, if I had to walk home in the dark.
Henry.
This your kid?
Hey, kid.
Phil "The Thrill" Shershow.
Shawn.
This is Burton "Oil Can" Guster.
Good to meetcha.
Hey, Henry tell ya for 20 years, I been handicapping horses?
That seems so very cruel.
He musta told ya I hit the pick six in '87?
Hey Phil, I think it's pretty safe to assume, - I haven't told 'em anything.
- Five minutes to post.
Gotta make it back.
Henry tell ya I like the 2-3-4 trifecta box?
I think your shirt and his shirt should get together and go bowling.
You have all kinds of interesting pals I don't know about.
All right, Shawn, look, don't start.
Phil is not a pal.
He's a bad gambler who doesn't know when to quit.
But he also happens to be on a hot streak right now, which is why I let him talk to me.
Not that I need it.
I have won 8 of 11 races today.
All by myself.
All right, Shawn what are you doing out here anyway?
I tried to drag you out here for years.
I'm only here today 'cause we're working on a case.
You know, I think the reason you never came out here is because to be a good handicapper, you gotta put in the time, you gotta do the research, you gotta study the horses, you gotta study the jockeys.
Something that takes patience and follow-through, - which you lack.
- Yes.
That and a shirt from Mr. Furley's closet.
And the race is on.
Babyfaced assassin takes the early lead.
Babyfaced assassin strides into the first So what's the case?
Have you ever heard of a Jimmy Nickles?
You mean Jimmy Nicholas.
Yeah, solid jockey, bad bet.
- He's been losing lately.
- That's why he hired us.
He thinks that maybe something's psychically wrong with the horses.
Yeah, the horses are losing, that's what's wrong with them.
Yeah, we didn't find anything.
Of course you didn't, there's a million reasons a horse loses, and none of 'em have to do with crystals and moon beams.
And it's youthful spirit.
Youthful spirit pulls it out.
What I do is much more than that.
- It's It's intuition.
- Son, you got no case.
Oh, well, thanks.
We'll just go home then.
- Juan Carlos!
- Help him!
Medical assistance to the track.
We need medical assistance to the track immediately.
Carlos!
So A jockey who was alive at the beginning of the race is dead by the end.
Not to sound insensitive, but I say we do have a case.
- That sounds insensitive.
- Yeah, I know.
And you guys just happened to be at the track?
Jules, it's free churro day.
Do they have a cause of death yet?
Probable heart attack.
Uh, O'hara, I Need you to interview the rest of those jockeys.
- What is that?
- Sorry.
It's just little people make me Well, let's just say I had a bad experience with a christmas elf.
What, he didn't give you the right present?
No.
We dated.
And then he dumped me for a dancer from the ice storm on ice.
She is an enigma wrapped in a little, blonde riddle.
Shawn, I don't think Juan Carlos died of a heart attack.
I only got to see him for a second, but I'm pretty sure he had blood shot eyes.
And his body was totally stiff.
That's a reaction to a tranquilizer or even a poison.
Something affected his nervous system.
Thank you, Dr. Pratt.
- See if we can get another look at that body.
- You bet.
Hey, you two, don't go anywhere.
I wanna talk to you when I'm done.
Gus has a cramp.
I have a cramp?
We have to pee.
Fine, just be back in five minutes.
"We gotta pee"?
that's the best you can come up with?
Just hurry up.
Really?
How short was this guy?
Give it one more.
We have boots.
We've confirmed that a heart attack was the cause of Juan Carlos espinoza's death.
Wait.
Everyone stop.
Let's acknowledge that the chief is wearing leopard print.
And continue.
I'm getting something.
A rose with, with, with A thorn.
No.
A rocket.
Rikki rocket.
C. Deville.
- David Lee Roth?
- Wrong band.
- Poison.
- Yes.
Poison.
Juan Carlos was poisoned.
- He's right.
- Chief, I am so sick of Lassiter treating us like second-class citizens.
- What?
- You're right.
Espinoza had a cocktail of drugs in his system.
Opiates, barbiturates, cocaine, three different kinds of weight loss drugs, - cyalis, and horse tranquilizers.
- Horse tranquilizers?
Apparently, the guy took everything in sight.
He was 4'9" and 3 feet of that were drugs.
And obviously, his heart couldn't handle it.
A very thorough job, detectives.
I'm getting something else.
Juan Carlos was having an affair.
With a married woman.
- Shawn, how do you know this?
- Same way I know that as a child, Lassie wanted nothing more than a pony.
Well, come on, who didn't?
Anyone who wasn't an eight-year-old girl.
Uh-oh.
I see a tall, blonde woman.
- Brigitte Nielson?
- No!
She has 23 diamonds in her wedding ring.
And she bandies about the track, this way and that.
Shouldn't we at least find this woman and talk to her?
Do you know anything about this, detectives?
Oh, well, maybe you should find out before we put this case to bed.
Lassie Your childhood must've been pure hell.
The good news, I'm available for hugs.
Jules.
How about it?
- Buddy.
It's been a while.
- Please.
- You're here early.
- Yeah, couldn't sleep, you know?
Came in early, did a little work on the case.
Went for a run.
Oh, and I did this.
Nice.
I did some work as well.
Turns out the horse tranquilizer Juan Carlos had in his body was ketamine.
Which doesn't make any sense.
'Cause ketamine causes a state of anesthesia.
Well, that's good, Gus, but I was talking about the spitball incident.
The spitball incident?
Shawn, you need to leave that alone.
If you haven't figured it out by now, you never will.
I can't leave it alone.
I won't.
I've gone over it in my head a thousand times.
Just hear me out.
- What are you doing here?
- This is my head, dude.
I can do whatever I want.
What did we miss?
What's going on here?
Is that what my hair looks like in the future?
- It sure is.
- But I thought I'd be bald by 20.
- This changes everything.
- Yeah, it does Think big.
It was Jimmy.
He's sipping through the straw, not spitting it out.
It couldn't have been him.
There was a second spitter.
That's so cool.
Let it go, Shawn.
Your second spitter theory is crazy.
Oh yeah, what about your teen wolf theory?
Hey, that's just a fact.
If any of us were in high school and some dude became a wolf, we wouldn't be cool with him just because he could dunk a basketball.
I certainly wouldn't be selling "I heart wol I could tell you that.
- Oh, save it for your podcast.
- Hey, you brought it up.
I'm gonna go talk to Jimmy Nickles.
You look for T.B.W. - T.B.W.?
- Tall Blonde Woman.
I abbreviated, Gus.
All the kids are doing it these days.
Just hope we don't run into my - Y.D.?
- Y.D.?
Your dad.
And it's too late.
Oh, my god, the shirt has a brother.
Ha, very funny, Shawn.
If you're looking for your boy Jimmy, they just announced he was taken off all the races for the day.
Seriously?
I wonder why.
Isn't that Barry Sarner?
The announcer guy.
- He's like a local legend.
- Yeah, "the voice," right?
yeah.
Hey, dad, do you know him?
Can you introduce us or what?
No, I met him once at a policeman's ball, but it was years ago.
Hey, uh, Mr. Sarner.
- Hi.
- Look who's here.
Your old pal.
Hank Spencer.
- Do I know you?
- No, but we know you.
What is it you always say?
"And the race is on".
and the race is on.
And the race is On!
- Hey, can you do it for us one time?
- And the race is on.
That's it, right there.
Won't you boys have a button?
I'm sorry, Mr. Sarner.
I'm Henry Spencer.
This is my son Shawn and his friend Gus.
They finally just started coming to the races.
Oh, too bad.
The track's probably closing down after this meet.
- 25 years I've been doing this.
- Why is it closing down?
- Well, no one comes anymore.
- Is it because of his shirt?
I'm sorry, dad, this is, like, a genocide of color Somewhere, a rainbow's weeping.
Mr. Sarner, do you know why Jimmy Nickles was pulled off all of his races today?
We're his buddies.
We came down to see him.
No, uh It's a shame, really.
Jimmy was just getting back to a full schedule.
Juan Carlos had taken most of his good mounts - before he died.
- Really?
We didn't know that.
Oh, they quarreled about it all the time.
Did they?
Shawn, look.
T.B.W. Way to stay on the abbreviation train, Gus.
You mean the A.T.?
You're talking about Janine?
That's Jimmy's wife.
- T.B.W. is Jimmy's wife?
- Yes.
Looks like Juan Carlos was taking all of Jimmy's mounts.
I didn't kill Juan Carlos!
I didn't do it, I swear!
- Come on!
You gotta believe me!
- Back off.
Okay, so let me get this straight.
You took on this case because you felt bad about Jimmy getting kicked out of school for something he didn't do.
And now you just convinced the police to reopen the case that led to Jimmy being arrested for murder.
Did I ask for nutshelling?
I think he looks like a tangelo in that outfit.
Or maybe a clementine with seeds full of hate.
I think he looks like an evil little creamsicle.
- You mean dreamsicle.
- No, Shawn, creamsicle.
They're exclusively orange.
Okay, Lassiter says you can have five minutes with Jimmy.
Sweet.
And good job, by the way.
We never would've reopened the case and arrested him if it wasn't for you.
You didn't tell Jimmy that, did you?
No.
- I didn't kill Juan Carlos.
- We know.
Someone must've tipped'em off.
But I swear I didn't do it.
Say Jimmy, isn't that exactly like you and that spitball incident?
Guys!
Look I think what Gus is trying to say is we'd really like to help.
- We would, but the evidence.
- What?
- Juan Carlos took all your mounts.
- Yeah.
- You fought with him over it.
- Yeah.
- They found ketamine in your locker.
- That wasn't mine.
And your wife was having an affair with Juan Carlos.
What?
!
All right, purvis, put me down.
Don't push me.
I'm getting the feeling he didn't know about the affair.
You think?
I'm sorry, I just I can't believe she would do that.
Especially after I told her I wouldn't sleep with any more russian models.
I think we may have gotten off point, Jimmy.
Let's go back to the beginning.
Obviously, the races you lost are somehow connected to Juan Carlos's murder.
So is there anything else you can tell us or that you remember about those races?
No.
The horses were all running great.
But right around the clubhouse turn, they all faded down the stretch.
All of them faded down the stretch?
You know what?
Yeah.
Good.
That's a good place to begin.
All right, that's enough, Shawn, let's go.
You've been standing at that thing for an hour.
Let me take off my shoes and try it lying down.
No, Shawn.
You don't have anything.
It's a dead end.
Face it.
- We have to tell Jimmy he's screwed.
- Fine.
- You tell Jimmy.
- Me?
I never wanted to take this case in the first place.
I'll race you for it.
What?
!
No.
That's right.
And I know why.
Why?
'Cause I beat you in the 100-yard dash in the junior high olympics.
Please!
First of all, you know I had shin splints, a torn meniscus, and a planter's wart.
Gus, you copied those terms from the glossary of our health textbook.
- You have no idea what they mean!
- Ask my doctor.
I had a ruptured patella too, but I wasn't gonna say anything.
Besides - Go!
- Oh, no!
No, you didn't!
- You almost had me.
- What?
I had you by at least a foot.
- I'm gonna give this to you.
- I thought so.
Not because you won.
'Cause you need a victory in your life more than I do right now.
What?
Oh, no.
We're going again.
I got a better idea.
Seven flights of stairs just to get another view of the track?
Gus, this is the perfect spot for us to see You'll find To see where the magic happens.
I told you he'd be here.
Can I help you fellas?
Uh, yeah, uh "And the race is on".
I really don't think you should be up here right now.
I'm trying to finish my taped announcements for the day, so Ooh, can I do one?
I've always wanted to be an announcer.
Would the owner of a red iroc-z in lot three kindly return your comb to the back pocket of your acid-wash z. Cavariccis?
And turn off your headlights.
What do you think of that, huh?
Have a button.
Hey.
I've seen one of these before.
Yes, it's a shaman's staff.
Yeah, I saw a special on the history channel About the The choctaw indians.
Ah yes, the chaka indians.
Long-standing rivals of the sleestak cowboys.
It's pronounced choe-koe.
Gave us the chocodile, amongst other things.
I don't think so.
I've been collecting these artifacts for a number of years.
I'm actually 1/16 indian myself But not cherokee.
Hey, Gus is 1/16 robot.
And not the evil, take-over-the-world fromi, robotkind.
Oh Sorrry Hey, you're the guy that tried to save Juan Carlos.
You're the only one who tried to help.
Way to go.
You should feel proud.
Yeah.
Uh, he died.
Yes, he did do that.
Yeah.
Well, gentlemen, uh Ryan and I have to go over some publicity photos.
So if you'd be kind enough "And the race is on"!
Chaka?
Really?
Yeah, I'd be embarrassed if I were you.
I'm not embarrassed at all, Gus.
Aland of the lost reference is virtually unheard of in everyday conversation.
- Can we go and see Jimmy now?
- Not yet.
Barry has tapes of the races in there.
Which means there's a copy of the one Juan Carlos died in.
I don't know why I didn't think of this before.
We need to see that tape.
There's no way Barry's gonna let us back in there.
Don't the police have a copy of it?
They do, but Lassiter's convinced the case is closed, so he won't help.
Which means I'm gonna have to do something I know I will regret.
What?
Ride your dirt bike off of David King's roof again?
No Ask my dad for a favor.
So I was hoping that in your very meticulous, detailed mode, it occurred to you to I can't do it.
He wants to know if you tape all the horse races.
- Of course I do.
- Awesome.
Can we watch the one when Juan Carlos died?
You may.
On one condition.
Deal is you go with me to the derby on Sunday in that shirt.
What did I say about regret, Gus?
- What did I say?
- I think you pull it off.
Shawn.
Fine.
All right, here's the race.
Juan Carlos is on the number eight horse.
I remember this, 'cause Phil convinced me to go with the long shot.
The one time I go with the guy, and the horse loses.
I don't get it.
What are we missing?
- What What aren't we seeing?
- Maybe nothing.
- Maybe Jimmy did poison Juan Carlos.
- I know he didn't poison Juan Carlos, just like I know there's a second spitter.
Shawn, once again, you're focusing too much attention on one aspect of the case.
- Close your eyes.
- No, I'm not jumping through any more of your hoops today.
You need to broaden your vision, Shawn.
You need to look at the outskirts - of the case.
- What does that even mean?
Broaden my vision?
Look at the outskirts of a You know what?
I'm out of here.
No.
No, no.
Not today.
You sound like Oprah.
I don't even know why I bother coming here.
It's a complete waste of time.
A little girl outside just started crying when she saw this shirt.
Oh, good, good, you're here.
You texted me seven times.
Said it was an emergency.
Yes, a color emergency.
But I think I figured it out.
The walls were sandbar white to suppress all creative thought and hide the asbestos.
The walls of what?
Miss Lepky's classroom.
Why is my name on the detention list?
You got caught eating a Kit Kat out of the trash can.
- The point is, when I left my dad's - You mean stormed out like a little girl?
I did not.
I did.
I'd give you that.
I realized my dad was actually right.
I need to broaden my vision, and that's when I remembered we all switched seats in class that week.
Right, I had to sit behind Janie Doran and her creepy neck hair.
And Jimmy Moved over two rows, meaning that the second spitter was on the other side.
Gus, get him.
Shawn, what does this have to do with horse racing?
- I haven't gotten that far yet.
- Let me know when you figure it out.
Let go, Jimmy.
- Hello?
- Dude, I figured it out.
- Was that really necessary?
- No.
But it was dope.
Babyfaced Assassin strides into the first turn at the head with none other right on its tail.
- Babyfaced Assassin - Wait for it.
Trade the top spot as they race around the second turn.
Right there!
The clubhouse turn.
Juan Carlos gets hit by something.
This was just like the spitball incident with Jimmy.
I was so focused on the stretch that I never looked anywhere else.
You know, I didn't broaden my vision, Dad.
Shawn, I love nothing more than to tell you I'm right, but I have no idea what I'm right about.
Question is why would somebody kill someone like that?
Guys!
Juan Carlos's death was an accident Yeah!
Whatever hit him was meant for a horse.
This isn't about murder.
It's about fixing races.
- The tape's ready?
- Check.
- Fake psychic ability?
- Full of it.
Yes, you are.
Mr. Spencer, what is going on?
First you help us get Oh Get Jimmy Nicholas.
Now you claim he's innocent?
I'm sorry, chief.
Psychic solar flares have temporarily blinded me.
My sense of smell is compensating for my lack of sight.
Lilacs in a meadow.
- Is that camay?
- Oh, this is ridiculous.
We've got big boy police work to do.
Wait My eyes are starting to adjust.
Where are we?
We're in the video room!
I'm blind, Gus.
Not deaf.
Mr. Spencer, we don't have time for this.
If you wanted Those tapes.
- What are on those tapes?
- They're the tapes from the track.
We reviewed them, but we didn't find anything.
Doritos.
Big gulp?
- Slurpee.
- 7-11?
These are all the dates on the tapes.
Gus.
Let's play these tapes.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
These are Jimmy's races - This one is when Juan Carlos died.
- That must be why they're in my head.
All of these horses faded down the stretch, as if affected by something.
And look here.
Juan Carlos is clearly hit by something at the clubhouse turn.
He felt the effects immediately, because he's a tiny human person.
With the horses, it takes longer for them to feel the effects.
And your point is?
Whatever hit Juan Carlos was intended for his horse.
What I'm saying is that this was an accident.
Mr. Spencer, that's a very interesting theory, but it's All circumstantial.
We're gonna need some hard evidence.
Yeah, but thanks for the A.V. Class.
Youthful Spirit fades down the stretch.
No, wait, he's He's gaining.
It's Youthful Spirit, Youthful Spirit pulls it out.
Youthful Spirit fades down the stretch.
No, wait, he's He's gaining.
It's Youthful Spirit, Youthful Spirit pulls it out.
The announcer.
It's the announcer.
He sounds surprised.
"Neigh," shocked.
When Youthful Spirit doesn't fade down the stretch.
Listen Youthful Spirit fades down the stretch.
No, wait, he's He's gaining.
It's Youthful Spirit, Youthful Spirit pulls it out.
He was expecting something to happen to Juan Carlos's horse.
That means he's a part of it.
Chief, every psychic nerve in my body tells me that something really big is gonna happen at the derby tomorrow and that we all need to be there.
All right.
It's too late to cancel the races, but I can approve a police presence at the track.
I've never been in the jockey club before, Shawn.
Thanks for getting me in here.
It's a good thing we wore our lucky shirts, huh?
Yeah, just worried someone's gonna stare directly at the pattern and have a seizure.
Shawn, we've had people watching Barry for the last six races, and they haven't seen anything out of the ordinary.
Admit it, you guys don't have it.
Don't worry.
We have it.
I don't know if we have it.
We just gotta figure out how it all connects.
So what is this indian stuff I got off the internet connect to?
That's what we in the fake psychic community call a hunch.
Ladies and gentlemen, the horses have reached the starting gate for the 84th running of the Santa Barbara derby.
And the race is on.
Uh-oh, two horses bump as they come out of the gate.
It's the three horse, snare the prize, and the four, biased opinion.
Kate's Conscience takes the early lead as the horses reach the first turn.
Authority Figure makes a strong move on the inside as the horses race down the backstretch.
Authority Figure and Kate's Conscience battle their way past the fall turn.
Authority Figure begins to take control.
Phil is not a pal.
He's a bad gambler who doesn't know when to quit.
But he also happens to be on a hot streak.
Henry tell ya I like the 2-3-4 trifecta box?
Huh?
Track's probably closing down after this meet.
25 years I've been doing this.
Dude, I got it.
Get everyone down to the track.
And Authority Figure wins with ease.
I really would like to cash in my tickets now.
Well, how did she feel coming around the backstretch?
Everybody hold your horses.
I meant metaphorically, but I like the love.
I sense the plan.
Hatched from the desperation of watching the track they all love so much shuttered forever.
Isn't that right Barry?
- Excuse me?
- You are so not excused.
You see, the track is closing down this year and Barry finally figured out a way to get paid.
But it was the equine who told me he had help.
Two people with intimate knowledge of the races and access to the entire track.
They figured out how to control the outcome of the races by getting rid of the favorites.
Because there were only a few horses in the race to begin with, they bet on the rest of the field, and their odds of winning went way up.
That is insane.
We didn't do anything.
That's not entirely true.
Whoa, whoa, what's happening here?
- Gus, little help, buddy.
- I don't do horses, Shawn.
Ah, Dale.
Dale, uh Hold that thought.
- What was I saying?
- Barry was saying they didn't do anything.
Really?
You used Phil to make all the bets on the long shots.
And Ryan here Well, he took care of knocking out the favorites from his perch in the camera well.
- With what, his camera?
- Exactly.
Lassie, do me a favor.
Take that camera off Ryan's neck.
Give it a look.
There's no lens.
It's some kind of firing mechanism.
Which is why he didn't follow the horses down the track.
I just wanted to make some money.
- It was Barry's idea.
- Shut up, Ryan.
They can't prove anything.
I'm getting something.
A fraction.
Barry's 1/16 choco indian.
And what are the choco indians known for?
Besides chocodiles.
For using blowguns to kill animals with darts dipped in poison.
Gus shoots and scores.
With an assist from wikipedia.
They used darts dipped in ketamine.
A horse tranquilizer strong enough to slow down a horse in the middle of a race.
With darts small enough to be missed on a 1000-pound horse.
But the problem was They accidentally shot Juan Carlos.
The ketamine, mixed with all the other drugs in his system, and the adrenaline from the race killed him.
Ryan.
You weren't trying to save Juan Carlos's life.
You were looking for the evidence.
And they almost pulled it off by framing poor Jimmy.
But they couldn't resist one more big pay day in today's race.
It's like my dad always says Real men take bubble baths.
And A bad gambler never knows when to quit.
Not bad, kid.
Not bad.
Let's go.
Get 'em out of here.
Now Who wants to take a picture with the winning horse and jockey?
- Come on, Dad!
- Gus, get over here.
Hey, I finally get my picture with us in our track shirts.
Memories, Shawn.
That's what it's all about.
- Just act natural.
- Yeah.
Guys, I don't know what to say.
I guess you're not such total fartknockers after all.
Thanks.
That's So sweet.
Gus, isn't there something you wanted to say to Jimmy here?
Yes, I do.
I've been wanting to say this for a long time.
- You know, back in school - Oh, uh, about that.
I had some time to think while I was in jail, and, uh Maybe I didn't treat you guys so good back then.
Especially you, Guster.
So I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for giving you wedgies, swirlies, Jimmy Nickle sandwiches, stuffing you in the trash can and, uh - Putting boogers in your clarinet case.
- Whoa.
Feels good to get that off my chest after all these years.
Huh, yeah.
I could imagine.
Say, Shawn, isn't there something you want to get off of your chest?
- Are you gonna tell him if I don't?
- What do you think?
All right, Jimmy, here's the thing.
I'm the one that ratted you out over the spitball incident.
Okay, I'm the one that got you kicked out of school, and I am the one that you should blame for almost ruining your life, it was me.
Almost ruining my life?
Yeah, I went to live with my dad in Maul.
He let me do anything I wanted.
I ate pizza and cookie dough for breakfast.
I had a race car bed.
I lost my virginity at 13.
It was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Hi!
You two are back together, huh?
Dude, she's a former Miss Oxnard with no sense of smell, and her dad owns an airport.
Course we're back together.
Latro, boys.
Okay, see That right there makes total sense in the world.
Yeah, but we can feel good about solving the case.
Don't you "eh" me.
Dude, I broke up a highly intricate race-fixing syndicate while wearing a shirt designed by a monkey coming off a three-day sugar binge.
Yes, yes, you did, Shawn.
But you still haven't figured out who the second spitter was in Miss Lepky's class.
- Gus.
- Yes?
You didn't.
Yes, I did.
You did that?
- And you never told me about it?
- You don't know all my secrets, Shawn.
I guess I too am a man of untold mysteries.
Burton Guster, I am seeing you in a completely different light.
You are, dare I say, dastardly.
Hey, I didn't want Miss Lepky to get hurt or anything, but when Jimmy got blamed, my mouth was shut.
Unbelievable.
Face it, Shawn.
I am, and always will be, that good.
That's why my friends in school used to call me "the g." That's funny, I thought they called you "big head burton".
Don't you ever say that name.
- I know it was you that started that.
- I'm sorry, Gus.
I have a knack for alliteration.
I'm a slave to it.
Besides, how many words start with b, really?
About 1000.
How about bold?
Black?
Beautiful?
- Who's gonna call you "Black Burton"?
- You get my point, Shawn.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna buy you an ice cream.
And we're gonna discuss some new, fresh to death nicknames.
How about "Burton, the billowy bear"?
What?
I'm just Spitballing.
It's my first shot.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Good morning, dad.
I made you some of your favorite bana nut muffins.
I had trying to get un-grounded before robocop comes out on friday?
Did I mention I made them all by myself?
Mm, not bad.
- What recipe did you use?
- My recipe?
Uh, I can't tell you that.
Um, it's a secret.
Well, let me see if I can guess some of the ingredients that you put in here.
Is that a hint of cinnamon that I'm tasting?
Oh, yeah, just a little.
And I'm detecting just a touch of cilantro and thyme.
Am I right?
- Whoa, dad, you're really sharp.
- Yeah, I am.
Gus, you want to come out of the pantry?
Shawn, what have I told you Don't hide Gus in the pantry?
No!
A lie always leads to more lies.
Instead of lying to me about baking these yourself, and then lying to me about your secret ingredients that you put in, you should have just said that Gus baked these muffins, and I might have let you off the hook.
- Who said Gus made them?
- Go to your room.
- I don't know where that is.
- Shawn Who's Shawn?
Public parking, huh?
Nice to know that my first visit to Santa Barbara isn't a good enough reason for you to pop for a couple of extra bucks for the valet.
The restaurant doesn't have valet parking, uncle Burton.
Am I gonna need tokens to use the bathroom?
It's been well reviewed It got four spoons.
Crack spoons, from the sound of it.
- Gus, wait up.
- Shawn?
Finally.
You know, I went to two comic book stores and three women's volleyball games looking for you.
Luckily your phone has gps.
- You tracked me?
- Yes, I did.
With a little help from my friends at your wireless service provider.
By the way, they might be calling.
They think you're a fugitive from justice.
Run with it.
- Who is this, Burton?
- Shawn Spencer.
He knows who you are, he knows what you do.
Don't speak.
We're going to dinner.
You're not invited.
- Let's roll, uncle Burton.
- Uh, Jules just called We've got a case.
We should go.
You know, Shawn, maybe you should handle this one yourself.
There's a first time for everything.
First time for What are you talking about?
Sorry, Shawn, I can't make it.
For crying out loud, Burton, the cops are handing you a case.
You've gotta take it.
You're the only psychic detective they've got.
- That's very funny.
- Don't speak.
- Just one minute.
- Yeah.
I know what you're thinking.
Of course you do, you're a psychic detective.
A few months ago I was on the phone with my great aunt, who's hard of hearing, and pretty much out of it in general.
I told her I was working part-time at a psychic detective agency.
She must've misunderstood because now everybody on my mom's side of the family thinks that I'm a psychic detective And you're gay.
- No.
- German?
- No.
- Invisible.
My assistant, Shawn.
- Gus, this is, uh - Wow!
I know.
It's a mess.
Why don't you just tell him it was a simple misunderstanding?
It's too late.
I can't come clean now without everyone thinking that I lied to them in the first place.
Plus, uncle Burton has had it out for me ever since he started going by "Gus," even though I'm names after him.
If he figures out that I'm not psychic, he's gonna make it his mission - to destroy me in front of everybody.
- All right, say no more.
- You're not getting destroyed by that man.
- I'm getting hungry over here.
- Don't worry, I have a plan.
- You do.
Uncle Burton.
How would you like to come with us, and watch your nephew in action?
Tag along with you guys on a real detective case?
Yeah.
Hey, maybe this won't be the most boring vacation in the world after all.
Maybe.
I can't wait to watch you work your psychic magic.
# I know you know # # that I'm not telling the truth # # I know you know # # they just don't have any proof # # embrace the deception # # learn how to bend # # your worst inhibitions # # tend to psych you out in the end # So, how you feeling, buddy?
A little nervous?
Feel something happening in the belly?
Maybe you should do some of your lamaze breathing.
No, you know why, Shawn?
Because your little plan to embarrass me isn't gonna work.
As soon as the cops see uncle Burton hanging around, they're gonna kick him right out.
Nice try, Shawny boy.
- Hey, guys.
- Ah, Buzz.
You know, I'm not sure they're gonna want you having any guests in here.
I mean, since it's a crime scene and all.
- No, it's not.
- It's not?
No.
There's no crime-scene tape at the door, the forensic guys are not collecting any evidence, and it seems as though you guys don't suspect foul play, so I've got as much right to be here as you do.
And don't give me any of that fancy police talk, please.
I've seen enough hill street blues to know what's what.
I gotta go.
Hey, thanks for coming so quick.
Who's this?
This is my uncle Burton, from New Jersey.
Shawn invited him.
Very nice to meet you, uncle Burton?
His mother named him after me.
It's not a very common name, but some of us still use it proudly.
Jules, what's the skinny?
What do you got?
Vince Wagner, longtime restaurant critic at the Santa Barbara mirror, died suddenly after eating his wife's chicken soup.
All signs point to natural causes, but the wife's acting a little suspicious.
I want to make sure I didn't miss anything, so I'd like for you to get a reading on her.
- Then that's what we will do.
- She's in the den.
Finally a chance to see Gus' psychic powers at work.
Shawn, can I speak to you for a second?
- What is the problem here?
- Stop playing, Shawn You know I can't do this!
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.
You make some observations, you form a conclusion, and you reveal it to everybody in a ridiculous and/or roundabout way.
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.
Raw chicken next to vegetables, charred pots, and a refrigerator full of take-out containers.
What does that tell you about the wife?
I don't know.
She sucks at cooking.
- Oh, you're on fire.
- What?
Uncle Burton, come quick It's happening!
Shawn, stop it.
Stop playing!
Put your hand to your head.
It really helps sell the thing.
I'm not doing it, Shawn.
This better be worth skipping dinner for.
He's a psychic wildebeest.
I'm I'm seeing something.
I'm sensing something.
I'm tasting something.
It tastes bad.
- She's a bad cook!
- You sound just like my husband.
Mrs. Wagner?
Oh, please, excuse my partner.
His psychic visions are often terribly impolite.
No need to apologize.
I really am a terrible cook.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
I'm sensing that you're at peace with your husband's passing.
Well, not exactly at peace.
But it wasn't easy being married to a food critic.
He graded everything I did.
Surely he couldn't have graded everything.
I never broke two stars.
Well, that's - Awfully harsh.
- So why did you keep on cooking for him?
Health reasons.
He had gotten a worrisome checkup from his doctor recently, he ate out every day for his job, and always brought the leftovers home, so I started making him healthy, home-cooked meals just once a week.
That's what dinner was tonight.
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Wagner.
You have our condolences.
She didn't kill him.
If she wanted him dead, she wouldn't have cooked him - healthy meals once a week.
- Great, let's just tell the police, and get uncle Burton out of here before they ask us anything else.
Check it out.
I went to candy emporium, this time for research.
There are over 100 flavors of lollipop on the market, not one of which turns your tongue black.
- Can you believe that?
- What are you talking about?
Right before we left, I caught a quick glimpse of the critic's mouth.
His tongue was coated black.
Now, what else could possibly cause something like that?
Bismuth subsalicylate.
That dude that used to play for the mavericks?
No, Shawn, it's the active ingredient in those pink stomach medications.
He must've had some.
Look, let's talk about this later.
My uncle is Gus.
The critic was murdered.
I thought you said the wife didn't kill him.
She didn't.
He was complaining of an upset stomach before dinner.
He asked for chicken soup.
That's the ultimate "I'm feeling sick" meal.
Except, of course, for a tub of bacon grease and hotdog water.
- But usually - Shawn, this place is a sty.
Maybe you ought to tidy up once in a while, huh?
Or did you forget that you're the assistant?
You are absolutely right, sir.
The person who's not the psychic detective should be in charge all the cleaning.
It just makes sense.
Meanwhile, Gus here has new psychic knowledge about yesterday's case.
- Yeah?
- No, I don't, Shawn.
I mean, I shouldn't spent so much time working - when I've got family in town.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous, Burton.
You think diagnosis murder ever let family get in the way of his work?
Another excellent point.
I bet diagnosis murder never did that.
Go ahead, Gus, call up on the spirits.
Ask them what happened to the dead critic.
Fine.
# oh, spirits always willing # # to lend a helping hand # This psychic stuff can get a little wimpy, huh?
At least he's not doing it in the tutu and capezios.
I asked you to help me solve the murder of Vince Wagner.
Show me what transpired.
I'm seeing something.
I'm seeing I'm seeing I don't know what I'm seeing.
Wait, wait.
It's coming clearer now.
Somebody put something in his food At a restaurant.
And that is what made him sick.
Sick to the point of having a seizure.
No, no, no.
That's what killed That's what killed his nose.
What?
- That's what killed him.
- Whoo, Gus!
You are so amazing with that stuff.
If it wasn't for his psychic talents, I'd have to get some lame job at a pharmaceutical company or something.
That happens to be a very exciting industry, Shawn.
Now let's go and tell the police our new revelation.
Uncle Burton, wait here.
No way.
If I wanted to sit alone in a dirty room, I'd have stayed at home with my wife.
I'm going with you guys.
Killed his nose?
!
You went like this.
How do you kill a nose?
!
Shawn, that visitor's badge is not gonna hold him up for long.
I can't be psychic in front of the cops.
Don't worry, I have a plan.
I'm gonna go in Vick's office, you wait here.
- For what?
- My signal.
The stuff you did in the office, genius, all of it.
But I wanted you to say "poison," Gus.
Poison.
- Get it right this time.
- This time?
Shawn, what are you about to There's no time to explain!
Ham pencils!
Sheila e. Tomato bark!
Velvety shark toast Shark toast!
Is there something wrong with you, Mr. Spencer?
You picked today to ask him that question?
Dude, Lassie, what happened to your arm?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- He won't tell us either.
And what were you saying when you came in?
- I couldn't understand any of it.
- Oh, Jules, it's this case.
These visions I'm having, they're so intense, I can't even describe them.
Every time I open my mouth, the wrong fishes come out!
- You mean "words"?
- Isn't that what I said?
Oh, no.
If only there were someone here that could translate.
You know, someone who's known me so long they understand everything I say.
Someone just slightly less handsome than I am.
Gus!
Perfect This is perfect.
- Gus, Gus, get in here.
- What?
Oh, mambo beef puddles!
Swirly-whirly jungle pants!
Quick, translate that into normal words for us.
Man, they made me fill this thing out for six pages of paper work, and they didn't put my picture on it.
- Sorry, who are you?
- Don't ask anymore questions.
No one.
Concentrate, Gus.
Tell us that all this means.
Swirly-whirly jungle pants.
It means the critic ate something he wasn't supposed to.
- Two bones and a skull.
- Two bones and a sku poison.
Yes, the critic was poisoned.
Man, this is better than "Ghost Whisperers".
Guys, we checked the wife's soup.
It's clean.
And am I now supposed to believe that Guster here - Carnival stud muffin Huh?
- What?
It wasn't the wife.
The critic was poisoned at a restaurant.
Now, that makes sense.
Wagner was pretty harsh on his own wife's cooking.
He was probably even harder on the restaurants he reviewed.
He could have easily been poisoned by a chef who got a bad review.
- Do you think so?
- Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay Call the lab.
I want a tox report on my desk asap.
You're actually listening to this?
Well, we've gotten information in stranger ways before.
Never hurts to check it out.
Burton, that was fantastic.
How do you do that stuff?
He can't talk tight now, uncle Burton.
Psychic episodes like that leave him very, very parched.
No, no, no, let me get you some water.
Down those stairs, around the corner.
Thank you.
What do we do now?
We've gotta figure out what that critic ate.
If he was poisoned by a chef, it had to have been something he consumed in the 24 hours leading up to his death.
- How do we do that?
- Well, Wagner's wife said, he brought all of his left overs home, right?
The refrigerator was packed with take-out containers.
The one on top was probably the most recent.
The restaurant it came from was - The curvy a. - "The curvy a"?
That doesn't sound like a place that serves food, Shawn.
It's not the name, it's the symbol on top of the box.
Come on, man, you eat out all the time.
What place has a big, swoopy, curving a?
I don't know.
What does it look like?
- Antonio's.
- Sweet!
- Why did you write on my hand?
!
- Why would I write on my own hand?
- This thing is totally permanent.
- Wha Shawn!
Let's make this quick before uncle Burton starts thinking of sticking 'em with the check.
Fire up the entrees for the eight-top.
Mario, where are my starters?
Hurry up!
Hey, chef Antonio.
We'd like to ask you a couple questions.
Sorry, guys, no customers allowed in the kitchen, okay?
No, we're not customers.
We're from the health department, here for a surprise inspection.
Again?
We just had the surprise inspection a few days ago.
- Why, is there a problem?
- Yes.
- You weren't surprised enough.
- Let's make this quick.
Walls and the floor are clean.
Drainage is clear.
Hand washing station is stocked with soap and clean towels.
Dry food storage over there, walk-in freezer over here.
Looks good.
Aren't you supposed to check the temperature?
Of course.
Gus, go ahead, check the temperature.
- Me?
Why do I have to do it?
- Dude, I'm wearing short sleeves.
So did you hear what happened to the food critic down at the mirror?
- That's some nasty business, huh?
- Sure, I heard about Wagner.
I don't say I'm sad.
Ten years I've been working in this town, that man never gave my food a good review.
Sounds like you're not very fond of the guy.
Vince Wagner made my life miserable with his asinine reviews.
Honestly, I am glad that that bastard is dead!
Chef Antonio!
You're under arrest for the murder of Vince Wagner.
- Take him.
- Murder?
Is this a joke?
I - Who put you up to this?
- Jules, what's going on here?
Tox screen came back positive.
Apparently Wagner ate a poisonous mushroom called the "death cap".
What are you saying?
There were death caps in the mushroom risotto Wagner ate here the day before he died.
We found the leftovers in his fridge.
Looks like you were right, Shawn Or Gus.
Or Whoever.
What a relief.
We caught the guy, we solved the case, and best of all, I don't have to be psychic anymore.
What?
We got the wrong guy.
Guys, it's not that complicated.
Whenever a critic eats at his restaurant, - Antonio prepares the meal himself.
- Not this time.
The mushrooms in the take-out container we cut into cubes.
Antonio cuts his mushrooms into strips.
Lassie, I have a really strong vibe he didn't do this.
Look, we know Antonio hated Wagner.
Wagner died from eating his risotto.
We have the risotto.
We even have Wagner's notes proving he ate the risotto.
It's a slam dunk.
That's Wagner's notebook.
It says the risotto was cold.
- So?
- So Whoa The sandpaper with the bana patch!
I think he means the risotto was cold.
- Thank you, Gus.
- You're welcome.
Why would food be served cold at a five-star restaurant, unless Unless the poisoned food was cooked somewhere else?
You know what I think?
Case is closed.
Hey, guys.
I want to thank you for an incredible day, Burton.
You're a regular rockford files.
Did my uncle just thank me for an incredible day?
A more important question, how much tv does he watch?
I'm serious, Shawn.
My cousin took him to the super bowl on a helicopter, and he never even thanked him for that.
I'm serious too.
He's like this crazy, tank-shaped encyclopedia of detective shows.
I be he even saw manimal.
- You're right.
- About manimal?
Shawn, we have to solve this case before he leaves.
- Why?
- Because, I think I've finally figured out how to get back on his good side.
I've been seeking uncle Burton's approval all my life.
He's mean to everybody.
But ever since he started tagging along on this case, he's been kind of nice to me.
You know why?
You don't have the braids anymore.
He likes detective shows if I could solve this case before he leaves, he may finally get over the whole "Gus Burton" thing.
- But I'm gonna need your help.
- All right, fine, Mr. Psychic detective.
Tell me, since Antonio clearly didn't kill the critic, who did?
I don't know.
Maybe we should find out if anyone else hated him.
- See who else may have had a motive.
- What?
You're gonna start a crime-fighting revolution with talk like that.
Shawn, you say stuff like that all the time!
Phil Pritikin, Mr. Editor-in-chief.
Shawn Spencer Long-time reader, first-time caller What's going on with the sunday spread?
Layout's waiting for your approval on the mock-up.
"Mock-up," funny word.
Like I was saying - Where' Salazar's Alderman story?
- She's typing it up.
- Do you want copy to read it first?
- No, just send it straight here.
Anything else?
You know, Phil, now that you mention it, I would very much like - Does he work here?
- I don't believe so, sir.
Son, I'm a busy man.
If you don't work for me, I don't have the time.
I just have a question about Vince Wagner.
Cooper, these guys got questions.
Oh, I also have an idea for a crossover strip, where Dilbert finally meets marmaduke.
Did you guys need something?
Hi, I'm Burton Guster, with the sbpd.
We're investigating the murder of Vince Wagner.
I'm Cooper.
I was Mr. Wagner's assistant.
Great.
Maybe you could help us out.
Do you know of anyone who may have had a grudge against your boss?
Are you serious?
We call them the angry chef letters.
Every chef who ever got a bad review would write a nasty letter to Mr. Wagner about it.
So you're saying this is all hate mail?
I don't know if I'd call it all hate mail.
It ranges from "mild dislike" mail - to "extreme abhorrence" mail.
- How about "I wish you were dead" mail?
Oh, we have those too.
Back here.
Any one of these chefs could have cooked the poison risotto and snuck it into Antonio's restaurant.
You're right.
We should talk to all these chefs before they open for business.
Call the restaurants and make a reservation.
- For justice.
- Is justice the time - or the number of people in our party?
- Just call 'em.
And make it for three.
Uncle Burton's coming.
All right.
So what did you think of Vince Wagner?
Looky here, he was a jackass.
You know what he called my award-winning jambalaya?
"Jumba-lousy"!
Now tell me if this ain't the best damn jambalaya you've never had in your life.
You know what he wrote in his review of my famous miso yellow tail roll?
"Miso disappointed".
Don't laugh.
It's not funny.
No, it's not.
Let's put it this way.
He once referred to my white chocolate tiramisu - as "ass cake".
- Oh, now that just seems mean.
I didn't kill him.
I was here that night cookin'.
Had a bunch of big groups.
Never even left the kitchen.
I was either in the kitchen or out here talking to customers.
I own this place.
I have to watch over everything.
Every bowl, every noodle, every chopstick I didn't kill him.
I definitely thought about it a couple of times.
I could never figure out why that guy was so angry.
He ate out at fancy restaurants all the time for free, and still, all he did was complain.
Ask her some more questions.
Maybe she'll give us some cookies.
I'm confused Why are you here?
Wagner never even reviewed my restaurant.
Oh, make it right.
There it is.
That was, without question, the tastiest dead-end we have ever gone down.
Well, at least it wasn't a complete waste of our time.
It seems to me like any of these chefs were way to busy to murder the critic.
Matlock never ate this good.
I'm going back to the car an unbutton my pants.
You know I've been thinking about what that dessert chef said.
Wagner got to eat out at fancy restaurants every day on the newspaper's dime.
If I was him, I'd be happy.
I mean, who wouldn't want to have that job?
That's a good point.
That's a really good point, Gus.
I think you're right We were wrong about the chefs.
Maybe this wasn't about revenge at all.
Maybe this was about Somebody wanting the restaurant critic's job.
- Someone who works at the newspaper.
- Exactly.
We need to get down there and talk to the editor.
Wait, wait, Shawn, he's not gonna talk to us.
He doesn't talk to anybody who doesn't work for him.
I don't think that will be a problem.
Okay, I think I have something here.
You, sir, are left-handed.
You have a new baby at home, you just covered a story somewhere in the midwest, and you You just really, really need to pee.
Just go.
All right, you convinced me.
Congratulations, you're our new astrological forecaster.
Now get out of here, you've got a job to do, you've got a deadline to meet.
- Hey, dude.
Did you read my horoscopes?
- Yes.
They're terrible.
Horoscopes are supposed to be vague, so that people can interpret them to mean whatever they want.
Yours are all way too specific.
I wrote them with specific people in mind.
"Aries: calcium is especially important to you right now, Mr. Salt & Pepper hair with a maroon car".
"There may also be a promotion in your future".
"Try walking backwards through doorways for good luck".
- Carlton, are you expecting a promotion?
- No.
Come on, O'hara, don't be so naive.
It's a horoscope - It's nonsense.
- Detective Lassiter, may I have a word?
Of course.
Let's see, what's mine?
Libra: Your one true love will be wearing sneakers and an apple jacks tee shirt.
That's kind of a weird detail.
Phil!
Hiya Wondering if I could ask you a couple questions about this restaurant critic job.
- Great, you too.
- I'm sorry?
Everybody, from the ombudsman to the delivery boy wants to be the new restaurant critic.
I know it's the cushiest gig in all of journalism, but I hired you to write horoscopes, and that's what I expect you to do.
Whoa, Phil, I think you're getting the wrong idea.
I just could sense that you're totally swamped.
I figured I'd come on in, offer up my sooth sayer services Sayer services?
- Sooth services.
- Sooth services To help you pick the best candidate for the job.
I guess you are pretty sharp.
Applications are over there.
Keep it quiet though.
Every single person who works here is playing some sort of angle.
To get the restaurant critic job.
Sir, meeting in five.
You know, these cheetos are so crispy, yet airy.
And its subtle flavor is such a wonderful contrast to its eye-catching color.
I get it!
Every day with the cheetos.
Shawn There is 100 applications in here.
That's 100 suspects.
My uncle's flight leaves today.
We don't have time to talk to 100 people, Shawn.
We don't need to.
We just need to talk to the one guy that can link one of those people to the murder weapon.
And who's that?
Delicious.
Are you sure about this guy?
He's the only mushroom farmer in the tri-county area.
If anyone can help us, he can.
Mr. Mooney, thanks again for taking the time to speak with us.
So, how many types of mushrooms do you grow here?
A couple of hundred, depending on the season.
Does that include a mushroom called the "death cap"?
The death cap?
Heck no, man, those things are poisonous.
Besides, they only grow in the wild.
Well, let's say we were looking for the death cap around here.
- Where would we find it?
- Well, I know a few places in the hills.
Why do you ask?
Why do you ask why do I ask?
Why do you ask why do I ask why do you ask?
Why do you ask why do I ask - why do you ask why do - Shawn!
I'm I'm just curious.
Yeah, well, a guy came in here a couple of weeks ago, and he had the exact same question.
Do you remember this person's name?
Can't say that I do, but I remember exactly what he looked like.
- Can you give us a description?
- Yeah, okay, man.
The guy was about nine-feet tall, right.
He had sunshine coming out of his mouth, and he had a hippotamus for a hand.
- I don't think I have any more questions.
- Yep, that'll do it.
Okay, uncle Burton, just let me know when you're all packed up, and I'll pick you up and take you to the airport.
All right.
We spent two hours riding up to that mushroom farm, and we're right back to when we started.
Don't be such a gloomy you, Gus.
Look at the bright side.
- Now we know the killer is a he.
- And that he has a hippopotamus for a hand?
That helps us out a lot.
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- "Sagittarius : Please return the bb gun you confiscated from your son in the second grade".
P.S., you are a cranky-pants".
That's an amazing coincidence.
Didn't you confiscate a bb gun from me in the second grade?
Look, Shawn, here's your stuff.
Next time you want something from me, be an adult and ask for it.
Passing yourself off as a psychic, that's bad enough.
But horoscopes Shawn, Shawn!
What if some idiot out there reads this crap - and decides to take it seriously?
- Dad, it clearly states that astrological forecasts are for entertainment purposes only.
Besides, I only took the job for a case.
We're investigating the restaurant critic murder.
The cops already have a suspect, but we're pretty sure that chef Antonio - was framed.
- Then I assume you know all about the veggie burger incident.
Of course we know about the veggie burger incident, dad.
We're professional detectives.
- Gus - Googling it.
Shawn, you know, maybe instead of wasting your time writing this garbage for the newspaper, you might try reading it once in a while.
A couple of months ago, vegetarian customers at Antonio's restaurant started complaing about how bland the vegetarian burgers were.
In my personal opinion, you eat a burger without beef in it, you've lost the right to complain about flavor.
I've heard that speech before.
Just call someone a hippie and get to the point.
The point is Antonio decided to make the burgers tastier by adding beef broth to the recipe.
Oh, great, all the complaints stopped, till some crazed vegan lady - By the name of "dwyer".
- Found out about it, and started organizing boycotts against Antonio's restaurant.
They've been feuding ever since.
This guy secretly fed beef to vegetarians?
Why are we trying to get him out of jail?
Because he didn't kill the critic.
Take a look at this article, Shawn.
She advocates any action to put chef Antonio out of business for the veggie burger incident.
She calls herself the "vegan vigilante".
How very villainous of her.
You think she could've framed Antonio for Wagner's death or what?
Only one way to find out.
Do you know where this dwyer lady might be?
Sure, I saw her at the drive-thru a couple of days ago.
That's very helpful, dad.
What makes you think she'll be there today?
Meat is murder!
Stop eating your fellow creatures!
All animals have got the right to live!
Meat is murder!
I hate it when my dad's right.
Stop eating your fellow creatures!
All animals have got the right to live.
Yo, vegan vigilante lady.
- How long have you been out here?
- Three days.
We heard that you had a grudge with chef Antonio.
- Were you near his restaurant recently?
- Yeah, I led a protest outside of his place on Tuesday night.
Tuesday night?
Excuse us.
That was the same night the critic was poisoned.
Dude, I think we just found our killer.
Detective Lassiter, SBPD!
- Who's in charge of this freak fest?
- Guys, we got your message.
Will you please tell us what this has to do with the Case?
- Nice shirt.
- Thanks.
Did you buy that today by any chance?
This old rag?
Nah.
I've had this thing for just about forever.
Remember when I sent off those cereal box tops to get this thing?
You didn't do that.
- Sure I did.
- No, you didn't.
It was the same year you got your first cabbage patch Shut up.
- I remember.
- Why do you ask, Jules?
All right, this wack job is in violation of at least six different municipal codes, and she smells like curly fries.
I say we cut her loose, take her down.
Where's the restaurant manager?
He's probably inside managing the restaurant.
Copy that.
Wait for it.
Wait for it - Is there a problem?
- No, no, I'm just Making sure I'm not being followed.
Good cop Always aware of his surroundings.
I better go help him.
Uncle Burton.
Burton, I got here as soon as I could.
Who are all these strange people?
It's all a part of our investigation.
We had to come check out a lead.
- Thanks for meeting me down here.
- Oh, no problem.
That ride in the cab gave me a chance to fill out this postcard letting everybody in the family know about our psychic detective.
Well, I hope you saved some room on there - 'Cause I just solved the case.
- Yeah?
A few months ago, chef Antonio put beef broth in his veggie burgers at his restaurant, infuriating vegetarians all over Santa Barbara.
That woman tried to put the chef out of business.
But it didn't work.
So instead, she poisoned the critic, and framed chef Antonio for it.
What are you talking about?
I never poisoned anybody.
You guys are nuts.
Hey, watch the way you talk to my nephew, 'cause he can see right into your soul.
You were there on the night it happened, and I'm sure that seeing the chef behind bars must make you pretty happy.
Well, of course it makes me happy.
He didn't have respect for the rights of animals.
- Meat is murder.
- But murder is also murder, Miss Dwyer!
We'll be right there.
Guys, there's been a development in your case.
Someone died from eating death caps, that were discarded downtown yesterday.
- Yesterday?
- Yesterday?
Dude, it couldn't be her.
She's been chained to a pole for three days.
Plus, we're now here near downtown.
She still could've done it.
She could have easily have slipped out of here - and done it when no one was around.
- Actually, she couldn't have.
We have a rough description of the suspect that threw the mushrooms away.
It was a six-foot tall man.
Psychic Bogus.
Our second victim was a homeless man.
Ate a bag of death caps he saw being tossed in a dumpster yesterday, then went to the health clinic today after complaing of abdominal pains.
He died a few hours ago.
What else do we know about the person who discarded them?
Not much.
The victim died before he was able to give us an accurate description.
And chef Antonio was in custody, so it looks like he's innocent.
Not if he had an accomplice.
Now that we've got the chef, his partner's out there trying to dispose of evidence.
Let's go down to lockup, talk to that chef.
Thanks.
See you later.
- Where was the dumpster located?
- At the corner of Laguna and Vista.
Shawn, we were on the right track.
Laguna and Vista is across the street from the newspaper.
Whoever threw out those mushrooms works at the paper.
We have to go back over there.
- Uncle Burton's flight leaves in an hour.
- I don't care.
Do you know what's at stake here, Shawn?
My entire future with my family.
Yeah, that, two unsolved murders, and an innocent man who's still in jail.
But your family too.
Dude, we still have no idea who the killer is.
And it's gonna take longer than an hour to figure that out.
Fine, let's go to the stupid airport.
Listen, Burton, maybe you're not all to blame for fouling up this case.
I mean I can't help but think that you'd do better at this detective business if you didn't have Shawn weighing you down.
I mean, I don't see what he's bringing to the operation.
You're psychic, he's not.
- What do you need him around for?
- You know, Gus, your uncle has a point.
What I'm trying to say is it was murder, she wrote, not murder, they wrote.
- That's true.
- Oh, this is great.
I left some of my clothes at the hotel.
Maybe if somebody hadn't rushed me down to the burger stand, I wouldn't have forgotten to pack my new yellow hippo shirt.
- You mean your hip shirts?
- No, I mean my hippo shirt.
I bought a couple of 'em down on state street.
You know, normally I don't go for modern fashion, but these hippo shirts, they make my arms look so huge.
They've got a nice little hippo logo right on the sleeve See?
Nice.
He had sunshine coming out of his mouth.
He had a hippotamus for a hand.
Gus, I just figured it out.
Who had the best access to the person picking the next restaurant critic?
Think about it.
Uncle Burton, you might be a little late for your flight.
So I'm proud to announce that our new restaurant critic will be My hard-working assistant Nick.
Thank you so much, sir.
I am so surprised.
I honestly didn't expect to get this job at all.
That's not exactly true, is it?
!
- Whoa, Gus - Don't worry, I got it.
You knew that Phil Pritikin would give you this job.
That's why you murdered Vince Wagner.
- Wait - I said I got it.
Hang on, hang on.
- You're saying he's the killer?
- Yes.
And I'm going to tell you exactly how he did it In just a second.
You never told me how he did it.
- Why do you think I'm trying to stop you?
- What are we gonna do?
My uncle thinks I'm the psychic, the newspaper thinks you're a psychic, and the cops think I'm just translating your visions.
- Give me a second to think.
- Hurry up.
Okay, I have a plan.
Blurt out something nonsensical Do it now.
Keylaces, shoeboards, pineapples!
Oh, no.
The visions have become too complex for one person to decipher.
- Gus, might I offer my help?
- Yes, Shawn, you Magic head.
Two heads working together as one.
You!
You wanted the most coveted job the paper had to offer, and you were in the good graces of the one guy that could give it to you, but there was a problem.
Now What was that problem?
The problem was Wagner was never going to retire.
So what did you do?
You hatched a plan to force Wagner off the job.
The first thing you need was a fall guy.
Unfortunately, Lee Majors wasn't available.
Apparently, he was available.
He lives here in town.
But he was a little out of your price range, so you flipped through Wagner's hate mail, and you discovered that chef Antonio was the perfect candidate.
You knew Antonio's signature dish was his wild mushroom risotto, so what did you do?
You tracked down some death cap mushrooms, and baked 'em into a risotto that resembled Antonio's.
But you made two mistakes.
First You sliced your mushrooms into cubes instead of strips, and second Wagner noticed that his risotto was cold.
Why would risotto be served cold in a five-star restaurant?
Because Antonio didn't cook it.
You snuck it in.
We just had a surprise inspection a few days ago.
A simple call to the county will confirm that there were no real health inspectors at antonio's restaurant that night.
You posed as one.
And that gave you the cover you need to switch out the risotto with your poisoned batch.
Stop!
Wagner died, Antonio was arrested, and no one suspected you were the real killer.
This This is preposterous!
You can't just walk in here and accuse someone of being a murderer!
Well, actually we can.
Damn right we can.
They guy you went to about the mushrooms remembers exactly what you look like.
After he toned down the drug-induced exaggerations.
Tall guy Orange cheese powder around the mouth And a hippo logo on his sleeve.
Al Mooney is insane!
- Nobody will believe what he says.
- Hang on a minute.
I don't believe anyone said the witness' name.
You're under arrest.
- Cuff him, guys.
- Busted.
I want to talk to a lawyer.
Looks like you're finally able to communicate your visions again.
It feels good to be back, Jules.
Matter of fact, I'm having another vision right now.
You and me celebrating over dinner, drinks.
Hmm, sounds like you're still a little off.
- Whew, another case solved.
- Yeah.
Now, let just get your to the airport.
For what My flight left five minutes ago.
Are you mad?
No Why would I be mad at you, Gus, huh?
Guys, there's been a bank Robbery downtown.
Chief Vick's asking for you.
A bank Robbery.
Man, that sounds exciting.
You guys don't mind if I tag along, do you?
- Well - Of course not.
Wait for me.
Don't worry, I have a plan.
Gus, take it easy.
And, Shawn, don't forget to vacuum the office every night.
I'm all over it, uncle Burton.
Matter of fact, you might just want to check out this little ditty before you go.
What's that?
Well, Gus, I learned from your uncle that I need to be a better assistant.
So I have taken the liberty to draw up a new employment contract that spells out the duties of the psychic detective's non-psychic associate.
- Assistant.
- Assistant.
Things like cleaning, emptying the trash, - doing the dishes - Thank you, Shawn.
- I'll sign it later.
- Nah, sign it now before he changes his mind.
- Yeah, Gus, before I change my mind.
- I'm not signing that, Shawn.
- And why the hell not?
- Because Look, uncle Burton, I gotta tell you something, and I know you're gonna be disappointed.
I know, I know.
You're confused because I'm here.
You don't know whether to sign it "Burton" or "Gus".
Let me tell you, son.
Your psychic abilities help solve crimes, it makes the world a better place.
Thanks to you, the Burton legacy will live on.
So sign that thing any way you want to.
You've got my blessing.
Is that what you were going to tell me?
- Pretty much.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Take it easy, fellas.
We'll see ya.
Well, there you have it.
You can sign it any way you want.
I'm not signing that, Shawn.
Dude, you can sign anything you want.
He said.
You could sign it "Don Cheadle".
I'm not signing.
D'brickashaw Fillington.
Delroy Lindo!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
I'm still waiting, Shawn.
Okay, I'm gonna take your pointy, sad-faced guy for my horsey guy.
Stop, stop.
What is this piece called?
I call him Dwight.
- What is this one called?
- B.A. Baracus.
Look, Shawn, if you're gonna play this game, you're gonna have to learn what the pieces are called.
What if I don't wanna play this game?
Chess is important.
It's about strategy.
It's about anticipating your opponent's next moves.
- This game is an allegory for life.
- An alle-what?
Look, when you're on the force, you're gonna have to take in huge amounts of information.
Alibis, motives, witness statements.
And trust me.
If you wanna win, this is not stuff that you're gonna make up as you go.
Do you understand?
And I want you to focus and get serious.
What?
What are you trying to say?
- I can't remember what it's called.
- What did I just Never mind.
I remember.
Checkmate.
Bye, dad.
- Tell me.
Is he cheating on me?
- Jury's still out.
Do you have something that he's touched recently?
I have the receipt from lunch.
I'm sensing that he always takes you out for lunch.
That he never pays with a credit card.
Always cash.
- That's right.
- I'm also sensing that you can only call him at the office or on his cell phone.
- Never, ever at home?
- That's dead on.
You must get goosebumps being around him.
- Oh, I get something.
- Daphne, I have good news and bad news.
The good news is he's not seeing someone else.
The bad news - He's married.
- What?
Are you sure?
Just tell him a friend told you he was married and his face will tell you the rest.
But when the mourning period is over, this is my friend Gus's card.
He's a good listener, and he's willing to change everything about himself for a girl.
Shawn, I do not no, no.
You keep that.
Please.
Shawn, we've reached a certain level of success.
If you wanna keep doing these "is my boyfriend cheating on me" cases, you're gonna have to do them without me.
Gus, you continue to underestimate me.
I'll have you know that right now, as we speak, we're on our way to the office to meet with two gentlemen named Shockley and Goddard - who have a very big case for us.
- So what are we talkin'?
Robbery?
Missing persons?
They want us to look into the serious matter of Well, that actually wasn't in the e-mail.
- So how do you know it was real?
- They used all caps, Gus.
- The meeting's at 2:00.
We better hurry.
- It's 2:18.
Well, somebody had to have the Belgian chocolate fondue.
Didn't they?
That was you, Shawn.
Well played, sir.
Just let me do the talking.
I don't want you to scare them off with your non sequitur ridiculousness.
Please tell me you're not Mr. Shockley and Mr. Goddard.
# I know you know # # that I'm not telling the truth # # I know you know # # they just don't have any proof # # embrace the deception?
# # learn how to bend # # your worst inhibitions # # tend to psych you out in the end # Okay, before one of us goes all crazy and demands the other one apologize for taking a case from a couple grade schoolers, let's just hear them out.
- What can we do for you, gentlemen?
- One of our teachers is a murderer.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
Please, continue.
- He's killed before.
And in two days, he's gonna kill again.
And the cops don't listen to us 'cause we're kids.
Okay, well, since we're here, and we don't have another meeting for A week, which one of your teachers is going to do this terrible thing?
- We don't know.
- Who's been murdered?
- We don't know.
- Who's the next victim?
- We don't know.
- Perfect.
I have no more questions.
- Shawn.
- I got nothing.
- Can we just start from the top?
- Yes.
That's a great idea.
Well, Shock and I go to Meitner, and The Meitner school for gifted students?
- These kids are geniuses.
- Technically, near genius.
The school has some pretty cool stuff.
So we broke in late at night.
Say no more.
- Fight club.
- No, to hack into a space probe and see if we could get it to blink a word in old morse code.
Which word?
- Boobs.
- Boobs.
You went from all that trouble just to get some nasa techs - to scratch their heads?
- Yeah.
- Come on, Gus.
That's kinda funny.
- While reconfiguring the receiver, we accidentally tapped into a cell phone call being made from the Meitner campus.
It was staticky.
But we heard a deep, gravelly voice talking to their cousin.
- Someone named Muriel.
- And you want us to figure out why someone would name their kid Muriel?
The voice said something like, "I'm not gonna be pushed into a corner again".
are you sure it wasn't dirty dancing?
And then we also heard verbatim "if I have to, I'll kill him.
"It won't be my first time.
By wednesday, he's a goner".
A goner?
It may have been James Cagney.
Shawn, can I have a minute?
We're taking this case.
You want to take this case?
It's a chance to go undercover in high school a la 21 Jump Street.
Obviously, I'm Johnny Depp.
Sadly, you can only pass for Holly Robinson.
Why can't I be Richard Grieco?
Why would you want to be Richard Grieco?
Isn't this the part where you say, "there ain't no case here, Shawn".
just a couple kids crying wolf.
I don't sound like Richard Roundtree, Shawn.
- Why are you so eager?
- Same as you.
I was a king in high school.
Just because you carried a scepter doesn't make you a king.
- That's because I was In Macbeth.
- Dude, you played banquo's kid.
You guys, can you help us?
Is a lizard's skin dry and cracked?
We believe that it is.
Guess what today is.
It's not one of those touchy-feely holidays invented by card companies to goad me into buying a present for somebody I couldn't care less about, is it?
- No, today's our anniversary.
- Come again?
It's been one year to the day that I came to Santa Barbara and we got partnered up.
- I didn't get you a present.
- I don't want a present.
That's what all women say.
But believe me, deep down, you want a present.
My soon-to-be ex-wife always hated what I gave her.
- What did you give her?
- Cash, mostly.
Anyway, this anniversary means that my one-year probation period is over.
So what I want, that is, what would be good, what I'm trying to say is I think I'm entitled to be primary on a case.
How late are the shops open tonight?
Chief Vick says molding young officers is your duty.
And she's already approved this.
Now give me a case.
Fine.
Let's see.
Homicide.
That's a bit messy for your first time.
Hi-tech burglary.
You need a lot of forensics for that one.
Bake sale slap fight.
Seems easy, but believe me, I worked one once.
- Had to call in S.W.A.T.
- Oh, come on.
All right.
Couple kids came in complaing about one of the teachers.
Are you sure there's nothing of lower priority for me to handle?
Lesson number one, O'Hara.
There are no small cases, only small detectives.
Let's roll.
Ah, high school.
You know, I've always wanted to prove that one of our teachers was a monster.
You remember our freshman music teacher, Mrs. Jorgenstorm?
- She was a nightbreed.
- She was not.
- She used to date Craig Sheffer.
- She did not.
She wore a ton of make-up and lived in a cemetery.
- Next to a cemetery.
- So she claimed.
If I remember correctly, you were always too afraid to follow her home.
- So any leads yet?
- Hold it there, Doogie.
First things first.
Where do I get a juice box?
- And does it come in grape-a-licious?
- Shouldn't you be doing psychic stuff?
Someone could be killed in the next If you're so smart, why don't you solve the thing?
Midterms?
Duh.
I need to maintain my G.P.A. to keep my scholarship stipend.
All right, all right, all right.
Clearly, we have to get inside.
What's our cover gonna be?
Wait, I've got it.
You're the preppy jerk who's dating the girl I'm in love with.
I'm the lonely cafeteria guy who mows lawns and has a heart of gold.
Let it go, Shawn.
You can't pass for a teenager.
Yeah, he's right.
You got rhytids around the eyes.
- What did he just say to me?
- Crow's feet.
Do you squint or make funny faces a lot?
You guys are all nuts.
If I grew my hair out, raised my voice an octave, I could Stop, Shawn.
I've already worked it out.
We're documentarians working on a new film called "Teeniuses in the mix".
- Teeniuses?
- Yes.
Really, dude?
You've got Teeniuses right on the tip of your tongue?
- In the mix.
- We already got your cover story.
Personally, I'm not sure that I see the merits of a class in paranormal studies, but we do let the students choose one guest instructor a semester.
C. Everett Koop was crushed that he didn't get it.
What is this?
Like a study hall?
Oh, no.
Recess.
Does it Smell Like Teen Spirit in here?
So tell me, Headmaster, can a former applicant request his or her file?
Oh, no.
Why?
Oh, for the general public's general welfare.
You know, generally.
Debbie will give you the forms you'll need to sign.
- An application, Gus?
- Just curious.
You applied to this school back in the day.
Didn't you?
- And you didn't tell me about it.
- Who can remember that far back?
W-whoa, is that why you cried for a month when we were ten?
Because they rejected you?
Get down.
Excuse me.
O'Hara.
Lesson number two.
Cops don't wait in line.
They go straight to the front.
Even at Starbucks.
Hi, SPBD.
Can I please get the class schedules for these students?
Thank you.
Lesson number three.
Don't say "please", don't say "thank you," and definitely don't say "hi".
Spirit Squad auditions were over ten years ago.
You're an authority figure.
Act like it.
Ever heard "you catch more flies with honey"?
Lesson number four.
Don't quote cornpone country bumpkin sayings to your commanding officer.
- How many lessons are there?
- 638.
Welcome to the Meitner school for gifted children.
- How may we It's a miracle.
- Thank God, you're all right.
We heard a cop named Lassie died.
Jules, tell me you got the flowers.
Lassie three was a retired police dog.
From the obit, it's amazing what you two had in common.
- Strong, dedicated, loyal.
- Bouts with ringworm.
Expressive eyes.
Goes like this after he poops.
Seriously, are you guys working my case?
Case?
What case?
No, no, no, no.
They've been after me for a while to teach a class.
What do we say?
Oh!
Right.
Stay out of our way and don't get involved, Spencer.
This place is overwhelming.
Where do we even start?
Easy.
Who were the eyes and ears of Dufman elementary?
Mr. Graves, the custodian.
We had a special bond.
Custodians have access to the building at night.
He could be our bad guy.
If he has a deep and gravelly voice, he's el suspecto primero.
How you doing?
I'm mopping up vomit.
How do you think I'm doing?
By the way, those mats in front of the doors are to rub your shoes on.
Thanks for the extra work.
Sorry about that.
Uh, I'm Shawn Spencer, psychic lecturer.
And I sense that something is amiss in your universe.
- Yeah, my lumbago's flaring up.
- Nope, not that.
Something a little more out of the ordinary Something anything?
Can't you just tell me what you're looking for?
Did something happen here on Friday night?
- Nope.
Nothing springs to mind.
- I can sense you're lying.
The spirits tell me that your little pants are on fire.
Fine.
I found this weird gold pin when I had to work late Friday night.
When I mopped this area, no pin.
But when I circled back to wax, there it was.
So you're saying it got here in the middle of the night?
Who do I look like?
Jake and the fatman?
All I know is that after two weeks in the lost and found, it's mine.
Legit.
Where is this lost and found?
Who loses a microscope and doesn't come looking for it?
Ear infection medicines.
Inhalers.
What appears to be 168 pairs of hideous eyeglasses.
S.X.Y. Apparently, our perp is so sexy, he felt the need.
to die cast it onto steel and wear it on his lapel.
That's not an s. That's the integral sign in calculus for the area under the curve xy.
Whoever was skulking around here after hours must be a math teacher.
How many math teachers work here?
Four or five tops?
It's all right.
I have a plan.
It's a scary one.
We'll have to rely on all our animal instincts.
We are going to the teachers' lounge.
Try to blend in.
Act natural.
How 'bout these kids today, huh?
Oh, my god, look at this selection of donuts.
This is pathetic.
Who left a tenth?
I wanna know how that makes sense.
- You - Shawn, focus.
Math teacher.
- There's no math teachers here.
- How do you know?
That guy's been wearing goggles.
He's clearly a chem lab teacher.
Violin hickey.
Music teacher.
However, a gym teacher could be more our speed.
Hey, buddy.
Uh, we're new here.
And we were told to see a math teacher specializing in calculus.
Professor Hahn handles all remedial math.
That qualifies as remedial.
What's calculus?
The one with the blocks and the shapes?
- Do you know where we can find him?
- You can catch him at the end of the day.
- He's in my carpool.
- Sweet!
Gus, this school has a carpool.
- Answer to our prayers.
- Why?
Gus managed to get his car impounded.
He parked on a statue.
- I'm contesting the ticket.
- Here's the thing.
We had to take the bus to school today.
I accidentally gave myself a wedgy.
Gus had to sit next to the girl who peed.
Why are you telling me all of this?
I thought it seemed obvious.
Can we get a lift home?
So must be fun being a gym teacher.
You get to play sports all day.
I teach gym at a school full of prodigy nerds.
I start off my day by getting 300 notes excusing kids from gym class because of rickets or IBS.
I tossed a ball at a student once.
He wet his pants.
And his parents filed a civil suit against me.
Professor Hahn.
Hahn.
Math teacher, right?
Yes.
Are you the new psychic lecturer?
That I am.
I'm getting a feeling about you.
Are you a right said Fred fan?
- Are you too sexy for your shirt?
- Excuse me.
I'm sensing you're so sexy it hurts.
Oh.
How'd you find that?
Hey, moron.
Right up here.
I'm sensing Riley may have forgotten because you didn't use the carpool last Friday.
Wow, that's right.
I stayed late.
Okay, right here.
Stop right here.
Deep voice.
Missed the carpool on Friday.
Sounds like our guy.
Now we've just gotta figure out why and how he's gonna kill somebody.
And one more thing.
If you are late picking me up in the morning, I will tear your head off.
Maybe just the how.
Are you prepared for your psychic seminar?
Gus, please.
Any leads?
I'm adapting this into a Nancy Drew fanfic.
I believe whoever's involved is in the vicinity.
We made notes for you.
Bullet points you might wanna try to hit.
- Don't show any fear.
- Don't split any infinitives.
- Don't dangle your participles.
- At least not in public.
Look, if I understood what you guys were saying, I'd still be a virgin.
Now, run along.
Go to class.
Really?
Hahn is here.
The seminar's open to both students and teachers, Gus.
I personally extended Hahn an invitation so I can grill him in front of a live studio audience.
If he's killed before, I'll get him to confess.
How're you gonna interrogate someone and teach a class at the same time?
First the carrot, then the stick.
You don't even know what that means, do you?
Leave me alone.
Phsysics.
The physics of psychics.
I'm professor Shawn Spencer.
I will be your psychic ferryman over the river Styx.
That's Gus.
My ferry.
- Hello.
- Each one of us is born with a kernel of what I like to dub paranormalevolance.
I, however, was born with an extra normal amount.
Two cops to be exact.
Allow me to demonstrate.
Congratulations on getting your braces removed.
That doesn't mean you're psychic.
Maybe you're just hyper-observant.
You wear that white sweatshirt everyday.
Shall I tell the class why?
You.
You, young man.
A little aloe will do wonders for that combination skin.
And perhaps you should use more care while shaving.
Or, just wait until you can grow facial hair altogether.
You could've just smelled my aftershave on the way in.
How 'bout a real test?
I'll write the answer on the board.
And I'll tell you the question.
Have at it, young Trebek.
- Trebek, I said.
- This is jeopardy!
- Potent potables.
- Questions that start with p. The smartass who thinks he's gonna make me look silly.
Who is this guy?
Your negativity is really impeding my psychic ability.
- Or you're just a big fraud.
- Go to the principal's office.
- Wait a sec.
- Get out of here, go.
Go.
Go, get out of here.
Get out of here.
None of you should be friends with him.
Psst.
Hahn.
Professor Hahn.
I'm getting something from you.
A kind of darkness.
Yes.
I see you clearly.
With a target.
I shop at Target.
Sure, but, but, I I see you on a cell phone with your cousin.
Plotting, planning.
Something secret.
Yes.
Yes, I've been planning a Surprise party for my sister-in-law.
She's impossible to surprise.
That's amazing.
Yeah, well, if she's gonna have puppies, she's gonna have puppies.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Look, if you had her fixed like I - Do you need something?
- Yes, actually.
- Well?
- Well, what?
Well, order me off the phone.
You need me to work, and I'm wasting time.
That's a nice touch.
I've been reviewing the statement we took from the kids on campus.
They said whoever this teacher is, he's already killed once, and he's going to kill again.
- Right.
- Right.
It strikes me that it's difficult to solve a crime that hasn't happened yet, so why don't we focus our attention on the murder that already has?
- Makes sense.
- Great.
These are the case files for every unsolved homicide in the Santa Barbara area over the last five years.
Lot of paper cuts there.
- Have fun.
- No I need you to review these and tell me if there are any connections with the Meitner faculty.
Yeah I'm not gonna do that.
You delegate this background stuff all the time.
To me, usually.
Almost always when I have dinner plans.
Now Go through these with a fine-tooth comb and tell me what you find.
- If it's not too much trouble.
- O'Hara, you are drunk with power.
I know!
Isn't it great?
And that amazing demonstration is phsysics at work.
It's like thinking of a song, and then, bam!
It's the next tune on the radio.
Or Or that moment when you know it's right to kiss a girl.
That's when you use the power.
Professor Hahn.
- I'm still sensing something from - Um, professor?
Call me sensel.
- How can we harness - Uh, uh, uh.
Sensei.
- Sensel.
- Yes.
How can we harness this power to help us um Kiss girls?
I'll take it from here, Shawn.
Oh, I don't know, Gus.
Now may not be the time to impede their psycho-sexual development.
Well, maybe you've forgotten that I was the one who took the hottest girl in school to the prom.
That's because I told her you were dying.
Otherwise, I would have had to pay for the limo myself.
Let me take this, please.
Gus, my ferry.
Thank you, Shawn.
Now, kissing someone for the first time can be tricky business.
I like to employ the Kadeem Hardison method.
When you're on a date Uh, uh, I can sense a question forming in all of your minds.
If it's "who is Kadeem Hardison"?
, or "how do we ask someone on a date"?
put 'em down.
Listen, it's not your fault.
Just look at this class.
You're all a bunch of dudes.
Um, we're girls.
That's awkward.
I'll cover all the dating stuff in my next seminar.
"Puberty : Monster or misunderstood friend"?
That kid I sent to the office had some weird zit cream on.
Professor Enrico.
Guster.
Burton Guster.
You interviewed me for admission?
- Math prodigy.
- I interview people all the time.
Was this recently?
Semi-recent.
But I tap-danced in trochaic tetrameter.
- Made you wanna cry.
- That rings a bell.
So Visiting the old alma mater?
- No, I went to public school.
- Really?
Could've sworn I recommended admission.
Either way, I assume a person with your skills ended up at JPL or some kind of think tank?
Actually, I ended up in pharmaceuticals.
You know Curing stuff.
Well, keep up the good work.
Thank you.
Dude.
You didn't even mention Magic head.
Guys, we're freaking out.
We're pretty sure professor Hahn is our guy.
- So turn him in to the cops.
- Not without proof.
- Know anything about him?
- The only time we see him is when he gets his espresso in the morning before homeroom.
- There's an espresso bar here on campus?
- Wait!
Wasn't Hahn involved in that thing?
You remember that thing?
- The thing with the other thing?
- No, no.
Just the first thing from five years ago.
When the student attacked the professor?
Oh, yeah, that could've been Hahn.
Some student attacked Hahn and he made sure the Headmaster expelled him.
Who's the student that attacked him?
According to the school computers, the only kid to be expelled in the last ten years was a Lester Baekeland.
What are you doing?
Getting the plague, apparently.
God.
Babcock, Babette, Battra something Baekeland.
God.
I can see why you wanted to go here, Gus.
They keep meticulous records of everything just like you.
Expelled for cheating.
Dude, there's a transcript of his hearing.
- What does it say?
- The kid claimed Hahn busted him for cheating Then tried to extort his scholarship money from him to stay quiet.
Hahn denies it.
Headmaster, of course, sides with the teacher.
The kid gets expelled.
That means Hahn is a blackmailer.
Maybe he threatened the wrong person this time.
Gus?
Gus.
I got in.
I applied, and I got in.
That means a lot, buddy.
You'd rather stay with your best friend than - You know, have a future.
- No, Shawn.
It says, "parents of applicant refused admission".
if I'd known I'd gotten in, I would've been ghost.
This place has a direct line to the ivy league.
- Why would my parents turn it down?
- I don't know - Maybe it was just too expensive.
- I could've gotten financial aid, Shawn.
Half the kids here are on scholarships with stipends.
Can we not obsess about this right now?
We do have a murder to prevent.
I'm not obsessing, Shawn.
I just found out that the course of my life may have been changed by my parents.
- You've seen sliding doors.
- I most certainly have not.
- Yes, you did.
- Dude, I have not seen sliding doors.
It was me, you, and Missy Isaacs.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about a Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle that I know I never saw.
Please.
I know you're home.
This is my fifth message.
Call me back.
They're just screening my calls until I've let this go.
But it's not gonna happen.
Gus, let's face it.
Your parents thought splitting us up at a young age was a mistake.
And I can't say I blame them.
For a while, I was your only friend that wasn't imaginary or an action figure of some kind.
Shawn, if anything, my parents wanted me to stay in public school so that I would stand out compared to people like you.
- Yeah.
No holes in that theory.
- I don't know which is worse.
My parents dodging my calls, or you volunteering me to pick up a murderer first thing in the morning.
Dude, it is your turn to drive the carpool.
What's our plan?
Today is murder day.
Speaking of murder day, is that really what you're wearing?
Shawn, in about two minutes, we're gonna be in a confined space with a killer.
Please tell me you have a good reason.
Of course I have a good reason, Gus.
This time, it'll be just you, me, and him, and I will totally break him down.
That's Hahn's house.
Or Maybe it'll just be you and me.
Well, according to our arson investigator, here is our murderer.
Apparently, there was a slight gas leak in the stove.
Overnight, the room fills with natural gas, the coffee pot clicks on in the morning, there's a spark, and ka-boom.
No, I'm sensing it was definitely more of a ka-blam.
- So you're saying this was an accident?
- Arson investigator says there's no sign of foul play.
The only time we see him is when he gets his espresso in the morning before homeroom.
Wait, I'm having a vision.
Hahn preferred Italian coffee.
Espresso.
Why would he be brewing coffee here if he was gonna get his fix in the morning at school?
I'm sensing our killer brought the coffee machine here and used it as a detonator after creating the gas leak.
What killer, Spencer?
- Our expert says it's an accident.
- I say murder.
It's what drew me to this wretched place.
Talk to the girl who makes the espresso.
I usually don't do this, but I have a strong sense she'll back this up.
Hahn had a cup first thing every morning.
What do you call those coffee people?
They're not - Cashiers.
They're not waitresses.
- Barista.
Gus, if you don't know the answer, don't make up words.
Dude, Hahn was broke.
No wonder he's a blackmailer.
The due date for the payment is the same as murder day.
Coincidence?
I think not.
It was staticky.
But we heard a deep, gravelly voice talking to their cousin.
Someone named Muriel.
We are so on this case now.
It's your call, O'Hara.
Either it's an accident and we're done, or it's a homicide, and there's a killer on the loose.
I don't buy this accident angle for a second.
Those kids practically said this would happen.
Let's bring them back in for questioning.
If you confess now, name your accomplices, I will let the D.A. know that you cooperated and maybe, just maybe, no guarantees.
Just maybe They'll cut you a break.
It's terrible.
- What?
- Am I scared?
Am I quaking?
No, that was what I call : "lower case mad".
You need to be : "upper case mad".
Those strange kids are in interrogation B. Listen, O'Hara.
Given your slightly, pedestrian performance and the fact that this has now jumped to a straight-up homicide - maybe I should take over as lead.
- But, why?
It's my case.
Which was fine when it was just kids telling tales, but there are certain nuances involved in a murder investigation which - require a more experienced touch.
- Nuances?
The chief says I'll learn by being primary.
- Yeah, but - But what?
There was an explosion.
I've never had a case with an explosion before.
I've had assault and burglary cases.
Once I even had a murder by thermometer.
But I never had an explosion.
Come on, haven't you ever pictured yourself trying to out run a fireball down a dark tunnel?
No.
Obviously, due to recent events, we are taking a closer look at everything surrounding the school, including the statement you gave to us.
You mean when we predicted someone was going to die today?
And they did?
- Well, that.
And - Watch your mouth, kid.
Okay, you're not fooling anybody.
We know what's going on here.
What he means is Please tell us again about the phone call you overheard.
No.
Tell us about your relationship with Hahn.
- You little son of a - Lassiter, stop.
They're teenagers.
We're sorry.
Lesson 63.
- Do not apologize to the perp.
- They're not perps.
- You don't know that.
- You two aren't really acquainted with game theory or prisoner's dilemma, are you?
He means you two don't really get the good cop bad cop dyad.
- Are you guys, like, together?
- No, she's way out of his league.
But no ring.
Given his age, I'm guessing divorced.
- I Wha Sorry.
What?
- Still can't talk about it.
So it's relatively recent then?
I'm getting separated.
Not divorced.
Did you ever just listen to her problems, - rather than always trying to solve them?
- No, you had to be the big tough cop, didn't you?
You never let her inside.
See this, Brainiac?
This is what's waiting for you when you turn 18.
You're gonna graduate, and get your diploma, and then, bam!
We're taking a trip down to the docks.
That doesn't look very intimidating with, uh, you know, the one arm.
When did my house become a daycare center?
Dad, you've been bugging me for months to fix your computer.
I finally bring the geek squad in to do it, and now you're gonna give me a hard time?
Thank you.
Hahn had someone's juvenile record.
Maybe he dug up something on our killer's past, which means - we have to hack into the juvie database.
- Yeah, I'm with you except for the part about coming to my dad's house.
Well, according to the kids, the hacking may come back to us.
Now the authorities will be led to an antique computer purchased by a former cop.
Can you say wild goose chase?
Jeez, this computer is ancient.
I didn't realize Colecovision was still in business.
All right, I'm in.
Muriel juvenile hall slash halfway house.
What am I looking for?
I'm sensing our investigation centers on the year 1991.
'91?
There's nothing but a bunch of photos here.
Click on the top right.
That's that kid I sent to the principal's office.
Kirk Godel.
Why the hell is a photo from today mixed in with photos from '91?
It's not.
This photo was taken 15 years ago.
I'm having a vision.
The man from Snowy River.
Eddie Macon's run.
Spartacus.
- Kirk Douglas!
- Yes.
See if there's a student named Kirk.
The registrar gave me access to all their files.
It's perfectly normal, you know.
- What is?
- The anxiety of being in charge.
I can sense you have the weight of the world on your shoulders.
I just really wanna get this right.
Oh.
I've got something.
Kirk Godel.
Godel.
It's almost pronounced like girdle because of the omelet on the "o".
- Pretty sure that's an umlaut.
- I've heard it both ways.
Let's see.
No juvenile record, only child.
All stats match up with his school records.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
- Let's see what Google says.
- Uh, search it with the word Muriel.
Oh, here's an article from the Muriel County newsletter.
According to this article, Kirk Godel and his parents died five years ago in a car crash.
There should be a death certificate on file, but there's no sign of it.
What the hell is going on?
A little aloe will do wonders for that combination skin.
Circle your horses, Jules.
We're about to crack your case like an egg.
And then, we'll make some umlauts.
With shallots.
And justice.
Please take your seats.
Good, I'm glad you're all on time for phsysics two.
The wrath of Khan.
Today's lecture will cover come uppance.
And how to solve a crime in a crowded room.
Someone here is living a lie.
Someone in this room is a ghost-faced killah.
It's not you.
But you have to do something about the hair immediately.
Okay?
I'd start now.
You.
Your heart is pure.
I'd say lose the earring, but I actually think he pulls it off.
But you.
Y Why do they always run?
Don't they know it makes them look guilty?
You need this guy?
Thank you, Detective Lassiter.
Have a seat.
- You mind telling us what we're doing here?
- Well, as the beautiful, industrious, Detective O'Hara has already gathered You're not the real Kirk Godel, are you?
Will the real Kirk Godel please stand up?
I don't think that's gonna happen.
You stole the real Kirk Godel's identity so that you could get into this school.
But there's more to this case than stolen identity.
Yes I'm sensing a much darker, diabolical past.
You did a stint in juvie for causing someone's death.
- What, are you, nuts?
He's a kid.
- True.
So how could this be possible, class?
Time travel.
He cryogenically froze himself - in order to travel to the future.
- No.
He's a clone of the original.
You know what?
Just never mind, guys.
Save it for your online role playing.
He's wearing make-up.
- Is he gay?
- No.
Well, maybe.
Look, I don't I don't know.
But the reason he's wearing make-up is because he is actually 30, - trying to pass for a teenager.
- 30?
- What kind of moisturizer do you use?
- Class, I would advise you take notes.
There will be a test on this.
You were always the smartest kid in your class, but with juvie on your record, you couldn't get into college.
Then one day, you read a story about a 15 year old from your hometown who died in a fiery car crash.
And that was the real Kirk Godel.
And you had a light bulb moment.
All your life, people thought you were younger than you looked, so you decided to take advantage of that and hit a huge re-set button on your life.
You forged Kirk's documents.
Then you went online and deleted his death certificate.
A new identity plus your natural intelligence meant you were a cinch to make Meitner.
Now you would graduate from one of the best high schools in the country, get a scholarship to the ivys, and become a young captain of industry.
And it was all rolling along beautifully until Hahn discovered your dirty little secret.
He blackmailed you for your scholarship stipend.
He needed money to make a bank payment by Wednesday, money you weren't willing to pay.
You were so distraught, you called your cousin to vent.
You decided that the only way out was to kill Hahn, and make it look like an accident.
Finally, you hacked in and deleted all records that you were ever in juvie.
Brilliant until the end.
Well, until this Until this last part.
When you got caught.
On the wild line.
Like a salmon.
Pencils down.
Come on.
Cuff him, O'Hara.
Here, use mine.
You've earned it.
Anything else I need to learn?
There's one last lesson.
Forget all the other lessons and know that you're a good cop.
You know I'm gonna need those cuffs back, right?
Good.
- Martinsdale.
- Macendale.
Jay Macendale.
Once we had the name, it was pretty easy to track the rest.
When he was 15, he stole a car on a dare, accidentally killed a pedestrian.
And that's what got him in juvie.
I can't believe he passed himself off as a teenager for this long.
I don't know, dad.
Slap a wig on you, you're the spitting image of yourself when I was a kid.
What is that supposed to mean?
What's his problem?
- He finally got a hold of his parents.
- Don't tell me it was too expensive.
My file said I qualified for financial aid.
Quality of life?
They have 24-7 slushy machines there.
The lockers are made with teak.
That's the strongest wood.
These pieces look like they're hand-carved, Shawn.
What's with the generosity?
I saw you were still using the ratty board with the plastic pieces so I went ahead and shoplifted this for you.
I'm kidding.
I bought it.
Those kid geniuses turned me on to a great IPO.
Now, remember, I win, I get the truck for a week.
All right, how 'bout, I win, you wash the truck for a week?
Yeah, I really don't understand what that means.
I'm out there in a pair of jean shorts - Continuously washing the vehicle for a - Shawn Focus Focus.
Too far to drive?
You derailed my future because dad hates curvy roads?
I could've been the next Wittgenstein.
I never got carsick a day in my life.
Gus doesn't deal very well with surprises.
I'll talk to you later, Mom!
You never told him I was the one who ran over his dog, did you?
Dad, no.
One thing at a time.
Thank god that dog was 17.
Checkmate.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
So then this, um, guy with pliers comes in, probably with safety goggles, maybe some sort of fire retardant cover all.
He starts doing his thing, twisting and turning.
There's all sorts of fluids just spraying all over the place.
Then this hydraulic lift comes into play, wheeling everything out of there.
There you have it.
- All right?
Let's clean up.
- Wait.
That's how babies are born?
- Yes?
- With a hydraulic lift?
- More or less.
- But how are they made?
Uh, Shawn, more important question, how many hats are in the room?
None.
How are they made?
Hats?
Nowadays, I hear most of them are made in China.
- Let's go.
- Forget it.
- Maybe I'll go ask mom.
- D don't, no!
No.
Wait, wait, come back here.
Come back here, come back here.
All right.
Tuck in your shirt before you talk to her.
All right, tell me exactly what she said.
- Use her words.
- She said, "hello.
This is chief Vick".
it's a good start, Gus.
I love it when she says that.
"I have something big to talk to you about.
It's top secret".
Come down to the station as soon as you can".
Do you realize what this means?
It means we're taking it to the next level.
She said "big" and "top secret".
that's two of our favorite '80s movies.
I read about the international yacht bandit.
I bet you we're going undercover on a yacht.
Gus, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
She may want us to catch that guy who's been stalking lingerie models.
I know what it is.
Last night on the news, I saw something about a blimp.
- "Blimp rides".
- Shotgun.
You can't call shotgun on a blimp.
You can call shotgun anywhere except a crowded movie theater.
All right, close the blinds, shut the door, and remain completely silent.
This is big.
Look, I'm trusting you both to be professional and to keep this matter completely confidential.
- You got it.
- If you knew how many secrets I was keeping from you already, you'd totally trust me.
- It involves a nanny.
- Nanny serial killer.
- Nanny on the run?
- Nanny arsonist?
Does she fly a blimp, by chance?
No.
I need you to hire me a nanny.
# I know you know # # that I'm not telling the truth # # I know you know # # they just don't have any proof # # embrace the deception # # learn how to bend # # your worst inhibitions # # tend to psych you out in the end # Our big case is finding you a nanny for your baby?
Well, I'd be hiring you privately, of course.
But I cannot stress how important this is.
Of course.
Our children are our most precious resources.
Yes.
That.
Also, I haven't slept in weeks.
See, my nephew was nannying her.
And then he went back to nursing school.
And ever since he left, she won't fall asleep, which means that I don't fall asleep are you up for this job?
!
I Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
See, I can run the background checks on the nannies.
Of course, not to mention, the drug testing, the psychological briefings.
But I want to hire you both to psychically read the best candidate.
Look, chief.
With all due respect, I think our services might be better utilized Your services are best utilized by doing exactly what I say.
You are not my first choice, Mr. Spencer.
And I cannot stress how important this is.
I Need Sleep!
All right, so, uh, while we're looking for this babysitter Nanny.
How about we also hop on board the yacht bandit case?
- Because I think - Oh, no.
No, no, no.
No, no way.
If I'm hiring you privately, then this is the only case that you're going to be working on.
I mean, when you're working on police cases, it's not like you take private cases as well.
Or do you?
- No.
- No.
- Of course not.
- We don't do that.
- That would be unprofessional.
- It would break the psychic/client - We wouldn't even think of it.
- Code.
Great.
You can go ahead and leave the door open.
Well, Harry, you and deeshaw start a timeline.
McNab, I want you to help Schwartz go over the witness statements.
Dobson!
I want you on tactical!
- Where the hell is Dobson?
- Look, Gus, a real case.
What do you have?
Something something Lassiter's case.
Dude, this blows with a capital z. Shawn, this is the only case we're supposed to be working on.
Besides, it's really important.
Nannies are essential parts of today's working nuclear families.
They're babysitters who drive.
Might I remind you that this is a private case for the chief of police to find a caretaker for her child?
If we screw this up, we'll be on her bad side for pretty much ever.
Gus, you're not going to find a nanny on the internet.
If they're posting there, they're already too desperate.
It's like online dating.
Remember when you went on matchmaker.
Com?
You mean when you posted a profile of me without my knowledge?
Right And all the women who responded were complete freaks.
That's because you said I was looking for a woman who was strong enough to hold me.
I didn't think they would take it literally.
Look, dude, all the good nannies are employed.
We gotta do some field work.
We gotta find the right nanny and steal her for chief Vick.
We should go to a playground in a really good neighborhood.
That's actually a good idea.
Plus this way, we can race on the monkey bars.
You know, Gus, we may be working the lowest stakes case of our short careers, but there's something nice about just sitting and enjoying a sunny day at the park.
Shawn, concentrate.
Look over there.
The one in the over alls.
She seems to be using reverse psychology on that ten-year-old, which is actually a pretty good idea.
- You know what's nota good idea?
- What?
Pineapple and movie theater popcorn flavored jelly beans.
- That's disGusting.
- Shawn, stop spitting.
You're scaring the children.
Hi.
Would you like some candy?
I can't say that I blame her.
These are disGusting.
I mean, these are really horrible.
- Why can't I stop eating them?
- That's it.
We're splitting up.
You're freaking out the kids.
- And me.
- Fine.
Thank you for that.
I'm serious.
I mean, I thought this was supposed to be a safe neighborhood.
Just because you're rich doesn't mean you're safe.
Marissa, get off of her now!
So you know Annie, she worked for the bermans.
She had to go to the police station because they thought she might be a material witness 'cause of when the house by them got robbed.
So Dakota!
Let someone else go on the slide!
They spoil that little girl so hard.
So then, an Perry!
Luke!
I'll be sitting right here.
Remember, stranger danger!
"Stranger danger".
the parents make me say that.
Hi, I'm Shawn.
I'm, uh, I'm a manny around here.
Oh, I'm Ada.
This is Jaynie.
- Are you with an agency?
- No, I don't model.
Strictly a manny.
Um, no, most of the families in this neighborhood - get their nannies from our agency.
- Oh, which one is that?
Red balloon.
You should talk to them about getting reassigned.
Ada's freaking out because she doesn't feel safe - working in the heights anymore.
- Why not?
Oh, gosh.
Is there a lot of crime around here?
What kind?
- Just some burglaries.
- Just?
All these houses.
- Only three.
- Three that we've heard about.
They all happen in, like, the middle of the day, and all of them had security systems and everything, and it didn't matter.
Yeah, but it's not like it's your stuff they're stealing.
So what do you care?
I don't like to be around it.
Cody!
Wyoming, get your foot out of that dog!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Which one is yours?
Oh, uh, I'm the nanny for those two.
Oh, really.
Do they always fight like that?
Pretty much.
- Which one's yours?
- Oh, no kids.
Just me.
So what are your thoughts on discipline?
Do you spank?
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Is that your nanny right there?
No.
She is.
So she doesn't always pay attention to where you are, huh?
It would be pretty easy for you to get away and she wouldn't even know.
Kids.
I just want to eat 'em up.
None of these nannies will talk to me.
Even the kids are avoiding me.
Tell me the truth.
Do I smell weird?
Nah, it's just the usual.
Jerk chicken and new car smell.
Look, I was talking to those two nannies, right?
Oh yeah?
You think they may be right for chief Vick?
Nah.
They're terrible.
Yelling at the kids, gossiping.
All they paid attention to is themselves.
But here's the good news, this neighborhood is rife with crime.
See what I mean?
Shawn, I think you're forgetting why we're here.
Did you really just do that?
What?
Hey, guys!
Buzz!
Listen, I got a call about two creepy dudes hanging out in the playground.
Really.
I haven't seen anything.
But I'll keep my eyes open.
Yeah, we've just been here hanging out in the bushes.
Oh, boy.
Sorry about this.
I'm so sorry.
- Hey, no hard feelings, right?
- Of course not.
I mean, if you have to have a Jackie Earle Haley moment, you'd You want it to be from bad news bears.
- Maybe breaking away.
- Not little children.
Listen, I'd be happy to give you guys a ride to wherever you need to go.
Attention all officers.
We have a call on a 4-5-9 break-in at 3192 roscoe.
There.
We need to go there.
- You need to go to a crime scene?
- Yeah, it's crazy.
The chief asked us to look into any new burglaries in the neighborhood while we were here - At the park.
- Okay.
Fine.
Hop in.
No.
Why you always get to sit in the front?
I called shotgun.
- No, you didn't.
- Shotgun.
Chief Vick better not catch us here, Shawn.
Would you relax?
She's not gonna show up at some random burglary scene.
We spent all afternoon on that nanny thing.
This is like a coffee break.
The coolest coffee break ever.
- This is so wrong, Shawn.
- That must be why it feels so good.
- We already have a case.
- Gus, we can do both.
It's called multitasking.
Okay, looks like somebody came home.
Kicked off their shoes.
Made some chamomile tea.
What ever happened to throwing back a few beers after work?
Whatever happened to cleaning?
This is disGusting.
Whoever broke in, managed to disarm security, find the safe and open it.
And killed a guy.
So this is where Mr. Teatime got steeped.
That doesn't even make sense.
Got brewed?
Got tea bagged!
That must be what killed him.
- Good eye, Gus.
- Thank you.
So Mr. Teatime wasn't feeling well.
He comes home early, surprises the intruder.
The murder didn't have a weapon.
Reaches for the first thing he can find.
Didn't mean to hurt anybody.
He's just a normal thief, right?
Dude I bet this is connected to those robberies the nannies were talking about.
Chief Vick!
Man, we gotta get out of here.
I think walking like this makes everything more exciting.
I do not think this is a good idea.
She was clear about only wanting us to find her a nanny.
Are you kidding me?
I'll have a psychic vision about the whole string of robberies.
- She will love it.
- I haven't finished the report yet.
- Is your other arm in a sling?
- Excuse me?
I don't want excuses, Carlton.
I just want the report.
- I'm not giving excuses.
- Then why are you still talking?
Head detective, my ass.
- Uh, listen, I can finish the report.
- I can do my own job, O'Hara.
- I know you - I can do my own job, O'Hara!
Who finished the coffee, didn't make a fresh pot?
I mean, who does that?
What kind of person acts like that?
Ooh, Shawn, Gus, hi!
Good to see you.
Come on in.
Come on in.
- So you found me a nanny.
- Actually, we were working on that when I had a vision.
It was a robbery turned to murder.
There's a light Oh, do you know who the murder is?
Unless you can name me the murder in ten seconds, then I'm not interested.
Ten, nine, one.
I hired you to find me a nanny, and that's it.
Yes, that's it.
Absolutely.
But, chief, I have this feeling.
Mr. Spencer, I thought you understood that when I hired you, this was to be your top priority.
Your only priority.
It is.
This is it.
In fact, we even narrowed it down to the final three candidates.
Go find three candidates.
This has to be connected to the other burglaries in the heights.
Don't even think about it.
No, you go ahead.
I'm just going to say a quick hello.
Hold on a second.
I might need to make that a large.
Can I help you?
You guys want to go in with me on a meat-lover's cheesy crust?
No time for a pizza party, Spencer.
Nothing helps a big case more than a belly full of pepperoni.
- We're busy.
- Okay.
Keep it a medium, but yes to the crazy bread.
It makes sense that all these burglaries were connected 'cause they all have the same M.O.S. Daytime burglaries Hidden valuables found and stolen.
Disabled alarm systems.
Yes.
That's what I was in the middle of saying.
- Well, then say it.
- Uh, hold on a second.
- Uh, jalapeyo poppers, cinnamon wings?
- Walk away.
Thank you very much for your time.
Now if you all can just wait here for one sec Shawn, I'm glad you're here.
'Scuse me.
I'm feeling really good about these nannies.
Jean has a background in Montessori, and Sue has some interesting ideas about establishing nap time routines that I kind of like.
All right.
No.
No good.
None of them.
What?
Why?
Slob, psycho, slut.
I spent hours interviewing them, calling references.
And you just come in here and dismiss them in two seconds?
Well, take a look, Gus.
The one on the far left is a slob.
She's smelling her own armpit.
Psycho there has been scribbling in her diary - from the moment I walked in.
- So?
Maybe she's just creative?
It's the same sentence over and over again.
Now, I don't know what that sentence is, but there is no configuration of words that makes that behavior acceptable.
Fine.
That still leaves Fiona.
Why is she a slut?
That was more me predicting her future.
- Aw, man.
- What?
All right, everybody out.
Sorry, ladies.
The position has been filled.
Don't drive angry.
- Why did you do that?
- Gus, she was getting married.
So?
She can still work for chief Vick.
No, she's consumed with planning her wedding.
She was studying that bridal magazine like it was a textbook.
After she's done with that, she'll be on the fertility fast track.
Then she'll have her own baby.
And chief Vick will be out another nanny.
And I do not want to have to do all this work again.
And what work exactly are you doing?
How about progress on our actual case?
Looks like all these robberies are inside jobs.
The key is finding the connection between the victims.
But we don't know anything about the other houses that were robbed.
All I'm saying is I'm just trying to say Don't make me slap you, Shawn.
Check it out.
I got some snapshots of the evidence.
Well, at least two of the victims have something in common.
- What?
- Startek Security company.
And you don't find it strange that all four of these homes had startek security, yet none of them were secure?
Actually, people get overconfident with a security system and neglect taking even the most basic precautions.
Like turning the system on, for example.
So you're saying all of these homeowners just forgot to turn on their alarms?
That's one theory.
- That's a pretty flimsy theory.
- Yeah, I don't think that's what happened.
What I'm going to need from you, spock, is a list.
I just told you, yes, I am second in command.
But my name is Gary Mills.
I'm at a loss.
You'll have to talk to bones and get back to me.
Jules.
Lassie.
Why are you here?
Well, I was just in the neighborhood and my ears started tingling.
And then they got pointier.
Oh, and my hand.
My hand started doing this.
All on its own.
- Like in that show.
- Star trek.
And this is startek.
Hilarious.
What's your point?
Excuse me for trying to take you on a wonderful psychic journey, okay?
I think there's a connection between this place and the string of robberies in the heights.
How'd you know about the robberies?
I, uh, felt a burning when I sat down.
Forget I asked.
Please excuse my pseudo-colleague's presence.
Now assuming That all four of our homeowners Didn't just "forget" to turn on their systems, I think a startek employee could've gotten those access codes to break in.
You remind me of one of my professors.
Did you ever teach at devry school of technology?
- No.
- Well, I had one of these professors who often had harebrain theories like yours.
If we were really gonna rob any of the houses that we monitor, we would choose one in a totally higher income bracket.
Take a look at this mansion, huh?
I would Rob this bad boy so fast your head would spin.
Really.
How?
- Lassiter, I don't - O'Hara, please.
What do you want, Shawn?
Gus, there's no way it can be these security guys.
I mean, they want to be cops, but they're really just on domestic detail.
Really?
Like you're a wannabe detective following a case we're not even on, when you should be finding chief Vick a new nanny.
I trust you to head that up, Gus.
Meanwhile, I'm going to borrow your car, check out those other houses that were robbed.
No way.
I will not have my echo be a part of your flagrant disobeying of the chief.
Use your motorcycle.
Dude, I can't do recon with that on suburban streets.
Help me find the nanny, and then I'll take you.
Gus, I'm a grown man.
I don't have to depend on others to drive me around.
- Okay?
- Fine.
Ooh, slow down.
Slow down.
What are we looking for again?
My kinkajou.
He's got to be around here somewhere.
Maybe he's more in the middle of the block.
- Your kinka-what?
- Kinkajou.
It's a 12-inch, monkey-like mammal.
It's become quite vogue to keep as a pet.
Dermot mulroney had one named "Baby Love".
but I named mine "Red Hot Monkey Love".
All right, Shawn, cut the crap.
I'm only doing this 'cause you agreed to mow the lawn.
It's time to fess up.
What is really going on here?
All right, fine.
There's been a string of robberies in the heights, and I need to get a closer look at one of the houses that got robbed.
Why didn't you just say so?
Because it's more fun to say "kinkajou".
All right, which one?
That one.
Yeah?
Well, that's a stupid house to Rob.
Does anyone live up to your standards?
Maybe we can get a hold of the burglar's number.
You can call.
Tell him how disappointed you are.
Shawn, take a look at all the houses on this block.
Of all of 'em, tell me why that one would be your last choice to break into?
- I don't know, dad.
I - Shawn.
Now.
Because all the other houses are easier targets than the one that actually got robbed.
Neighbor two houses down has been gone for several days.
Didn't bother to suspend their newspaper delivery.
- Good.
What else?
- The house on the other side is completely hidden by those trees and bushes.
It's the perfect vantage point for a burglar.
Especially during the day time.
Not to mention our house has a security system.
And bars on the windows.
This was not a crime of chance, Shawn.
That house was chosen for a reason.
- There can only be one.
- What?
I thought we were doing lines from "Highlander".
My bad.
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait.
That sensational feeling.
That is the quickening.
Everyone can do connery.
Your lambert sucks.
- At least I have a lambert.
- Hey, Ada, it's Jaynie.
They let me out early.
Want to meet up tonight?
A nanny wouldn't be able to afford coach sunglasses, am I right?
Well, she should be able to.
Nannies are criminally underpaid.
Right.
Because our children are our most precious resources.
Because children are maddening hellions.
A great nanny can make all the difference in the world.
Haven't you seen nanny 911?
No, I'm still trying to catch up on my dog whisperers.
Nannies on there are brilliant.
I wish I had one of 'em when you were a kid.
Uh, don't beat yourself up, pop.
Sure, most of my good traits come from mom.
But you, uh No, that's really all I got.
Okay, chief.
Let me begin by saying no.
We have not found you a nanny yet.
But I have had a vision about nannies, ironically.
Rings of nannies!
Uh, rings of of around my collar.
Of thieves.
Rings of thieves!
Supplementing their paltry incomes as nannies.
Rogue nannies robbing their bosses' aykroyds and belushis.
Neighbors!
Robbing their bosses' neighbors!
Chief, if I can just get a little closer to these robberies And And And we would still find you a nanny eventually.
Oh, Mr. Spencer.
I'm sorry.
I must've fallen asleep.
That is so creepy.
Your eyes were wide open.
Yeah.
I learned to do that back when I was on stakeouts.
I have never been so sleep-deprived in my life.
But thank goodness you found me a nanny.
N no.
No, we haven't We haven't done that yet.
- Then why are you here?
- That's what I was saying.
I've got some very strong psychic rumblings about those robberies.
I gave you explicit instructions.
And you're here to tell me that you've completely disregarded everything I said?
No, no, no.
Not completely.
Well, look, if you're gonna put it like that, then sort of.
Well.
Let me put it just like this.
And listen very closely.
Because I want you to get it clearly this time.
You Are Fired.
Yeah.
Ah.
From which case?
All of them.
Trying to solve that case is what got us in trouble in the first place, Shawn!
She said she wanted me to name the murder.
As long as I could do it in ten seconds.
And as long as it didn't distract from the nanny search.
So you find the perfect nanny before she does.
I'll find the murder for the police.
And voila, she's loving us again.
And exactly how is this plan different from what we were doing before?
Because now we're renegades, dude.
It's so hardcore!
Working without the chief's knowledge.
Racing against a ticking clock for her approval.
It's gonna be so much more exciting.
- Can't you feel it?
- No, Shawn.
I don't feel it.
I feel depression.
I feel a series of missed payments on our rent.
That's the only thing that motivates me to think we need to fix this.
I need to get more information on those two nannies from the park.
Maybe get into that agency where they both work.
And how do you plan on doing that?
It's not like you can pretend you're a nanny.
The agency does do extensive security checks on who they hire.
But not necessarily on the parents who hire them.
Come on, buddy.
What do you say?
Do a little cameo onmy two dads?
That show was canceled for a reason, Shawn.
I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to find someone else to co-parent with.
I was gonna let you be Greg Evigan.
I just think that startek security is a dead end Okay.
All right.
Fine.
What if I go investigate a different Yes.
I know that you are lead detective, Lassiter.
Oh, going through a tunnel.
Gotta go.
Please let me eat my frustration in peace, Shawn.
There's this dark cloud surrounding you.
It's starving your chi.
Yeah.
And down at the station, I can see a raccoon with dark circles under his eyes.
No Her eyes.
Oh, god.
It's the chief.
Chief Vick is becoming chief coon.
And she's She's lashing out at everyone.
- That's true.
- Especially Lassie.
Who in turn is taking his frustrations out on you.
Look, Jules, you gotta take your chi back.
Take it back.
And that means doing something big.
Something risky.
Something that'll help you blow this case wide open.
Marry me, Juliet.
What are your opinions on ferberizing the baby?
Oh my god.
Never.
That's disGusting.
Do you have any remedies for teething pains?
Two valiums.
You would give the baby valium?
Oh, no.
Of course not.
Those are for me so I can deal with the crying.
I just give the baby half a valium.
Look, Jules, you don't actually have to marry me, okay?
Just Just pose as my wife when we go to the red balloon nanny agency.
I need to get a better psychic vibe on a couple of their nannies.
And you need a nanny why?
Two particular nannies.
I think they're behind the robberies in the heights.
So you're saying that this string of high-tech cat burglaries One that ended in murder Were caused by a couple of 19-year-old nannies?
Don't be ridiculous.
Only one of them is 19.
The other one's a slightly zaftig, polish nanny in her thirties.
Shawn, I can't help you do this.
Oh no, no, no.
You wouldn't be helping me.
I would be helping you To solve the case the way you think it needs to be solved.
Jules, to get your chi back.
Investigate these nannies with me.
Otherwise your chi's going to shrivel up and starve to death.
You need to feed your chi.
Besides, I wasn't going to say anything, but I had a vision of us being married.
I know it's probably this undercover thing we're gonna do, but it might have been a vision from our future.
Mr. And Mrs. Juliet Spencer.
O'Hara?
Fine.
I'll do it.
She said yes, everybody!
She loves me so much!
But only for detective Work.
I don't buy into this whole husband and kids thing.
Marriage is just a contractual obligation that the state mandated centuries ago when wives were considered property.
But if we are going to pretend This is what our wedding was like.
It's sunset on a beach in Antigua So then I walk down the aisle to an a cappella version of James Taylor's "only one".
and by this time, the flower girls have tossed the peony petals into a soft, - butterfly formation.
- Hi.
I'll take you in to see the head of the agency now.
Hi, I'm Abby Daniels.
And it says here that you are Mr. and Mrs. Levon Tostig.
That's correct.
Why don't you tell me a little bit about your child.
Well, we had little millicent in a home birth with a doula.
And afterwards, Levon here buried my placenta in the backyard.
Some of our nannies are very environmentally conscious.
They're into homeopathic methods.
- Great.
- What kind of background checks do you run on these nannies?
Well, I'm glad you asked that, because the safety of your children is something we pride ourselves on here at red balloon.
I like that very much.
Well, why don't I show you a little bit around our offices.
And you can see some of the services that we offer here.
Great.
So getting any psychic vibrations on your two suspects yet, Levon?
I think I got thrown off picturing your placenta.
Now this is Steve Hitchcock.
He's in charge of the baby bonding cameras we install.
Part of every nanny placement package.
What are baby bonding cameras?
Well, they're a series of web cams we set up in your home.
You can log on any time during the day and see how your child and the nanny are doing.
- So you're spying on them.
- Oh, no.
Not at all.
The nannies are aware these cameras are installed.
It's more to keep in touch with your child.
Not to mention having the nanny know you may be watching her at any time, it encourages her to be extra responsible.
You're the only ones with the access to the camera feed.
You sign onto the web site using a unique password only you know.
So you can see, not only do we run extensive background checks on our nannies, you can check on them whenever you like.
Ooh, uh, sweetie, why don't you tell them how we decorated little Millie's room, then they'll know how to set up the cameras.
Excuse me.
Well, we decorated with a raspberry and sage theme.
And then we did this pinstripe wallpaper that really accented the sea foam green that we had done in the crown molding.
Perfect timing, Gus.
A nanny wouldn't be able to afford coach sunglasses, am I right?
Of course, I love what nate berkus did on Oprah's nursery theme week.
So I took his idea and I did the long, flowing curtains.
But only on two of the windows, even though there's four Hon, we should probably get going.
Great!
Well, if you have any other questions, you just let us know.
- Thank you.
I will.
- Or e-mail.
E- mail is good too.
O'Hara.
Uh-huh.
Where?
Okay, I'll be right there.
That was Lassiter.
Wants me to meet him at some exotic reptile shop on central.
Said they found some of the stolen merchandise from the robberies.
Ooh.
Can I come?
I'd love to see what my wife does at work all day.
And then before every nap time, we read good night moon and the giving tree.
Those are my favorite books.
And then she lies down for a 45-minute nap, which I keep track of in my client sleep chart.
I love charts.
When can you start?
All right, when'd the items come in?
Jeez Louise.
Does it look like I keep records in quicken in here?
Maybe tuesday.
Can you at least describe the person who sold them to you?
You get used to lookin' at lizards all day, people all start to look alike.
- Was it a man or a woman?
- Boy, you ask some toughies.
- I think it was a guy.
- Pasty white guy?
Beatnik haircut.
Stupid grin?
I don't think so.
Was he roly-poly like a puffer fish?
Spencer, what the hell?
- Yeah.
Yeah, he was.
- Now I'm seeing red.
Was he red-faced like a kol fish?
Exactly.
And did he spit a lot like a komodo dragon?
Just like a komodo.
Great!
I'll take this description down to our sketch artist at the aquarium.
All right, tell me exactly which items this fish man sold.
Your vision kinda sounds like that red-faced guy from the red balloon nanny agency Steve.
I was thinking the kool-aid guy.
- But yours probably makes more sense.
- Yeah.
I'm going to head back down to the station, investigate them a little more.
See if I can get a warrant.
So it's not the nannies that are responsible for the burglaries.
- It's the agency.
- Yeah.
Gus, I'm so glad you called.
You're about to be a lot gladder.
Chief Vick has officially forgiven us.
I just found her a nanny.
Oh, that's perfect.
I think I just figured out who the bad guys are.
The best part is, she can start right away.
Her security check is already done, because she works for the best agency in town.
Oh, no.
Please don't say the Red balloon nanny agency.
This is the part I hate.
Waiting for warrants.
Oh, we're not waiting for warrants.
Can you please tell me what we're doing here?
Look, Gus, we know the ws of the crime.
We know the who, we know the where.
We're pretty solid on the where of.
We're pretty sure of the where to for.
- We're scratch on the what chamacallit.
- Shawn.
- 'Cause that's self-explanatory.
- Shawn.
We don't have the how.
Why do we need to know the how if the guy's gonna be arrested?
Dude, I'm the one that has to do the wrap-up, remember?
You want me to get up there with eggs benedict all over my face?
The Canadian bacon in my hair?
Hollandaise dripping down?
I needzing.
I'm a psychic.
I gotta see everything.
Come on.
Oh, hi, Levon.
What are you doing here?
This is Samuel Coen.
He's my best friend and godfather to my little millicent.
Now he's, uh, very overprotective and he insisted on coming by and getting a feel for the folks that are going to be caring for his little goddaughter.
Oh, well, guys, I'm so sorry.
But Steve and Abby, they're out doing home interviews with clients.
You know what, we're okay with waiting.
Dude, she has a headache.
Start whistling something by philip glass.
Okay, you know what, guys?
You don't have to wait out here.
You know, I bet you'd be more comfy in Mrs. Daniel's office.
- You sure it's no trouble?
- No, no.
Not at all.
You know where it is, right?
Thank you.
- What kind of clues are we looking for?
- Any kind.
- Somebody chews tobacco.
- How about some new clues?
- What are you doing?
- Dude, I think this thing opens up.
Scratches on both sides of the wall.
It's, like, a secret door or something.
Nicely done, Gus.
These are feeds from the baby bonding cameras that the agency installs.
It's kind of creepy.
Yeah, especially since the only ones that are supposed to be able to access these feeds are the parents themselves.
This is our proof, Shawn.
They watch the footage from the cameras, get the security codes, see where people are hiding their valuables, and case out their houses.
We got it, Shawn.
Let's go.
- Whoa!
- What?
No, that doesn't make any sense.
None of the houses that got robbed had nannies working in them.
Dude, it wasn't the houses with the nannies.
It was the houses next door.
Juliet's gonna have a hard time serving the warrant here at the red balloon, when the person she's trying to arrest is sitting in chief Vick's living room!
Sweet black licorice.
I've got the how.
I've got to get Jules on the phone right away.
Time is of the essence here!
Jules, it's Shawn.
First of all, how are you?
Oh, that sounds nice.
Secondly, meet me at chief Vick's house pronto.
I've had a big vision.
Top seven of all time.
Let's go.
Thanks for getting here so quickly, guys.
- Where's your baby gift?
- A what?
The baby gift.
Lassie, we're about to enter the chief's home.
You can't just barge in, guns a blazing.
This is delicate.
The suspect could be holding chief Vick's baby.
Or we could make chief Vick very, very angry.
- You don't want that.
- Nobody wants that.
Probably should've given you this sooner, but, uh, happy baby gift.
Uh, thank you.
It's a mini rattle and also a low calorie breath freshener.
Oh, great.
Is there anything I can do for you guys?
We just wanted to say hi.
Oh, uh, Shawn, I'm glad that you're here.
I just wanted to apologize for snapping at you the other day.
Chief, there's no need.
Really.
Oh, well, you know, I was just so mad, I just wanted to strangle you.
But I admit I was wrong.
I realized I was overreacting after I tried to run my husband over after he left the garage door open.
- But this agency that you and Gus found - Yeah, about - Mrs. Vick!
- Yeah.
I just finished up installing the cameras.
Guess who just fell asleep?
- Iris is sleeping?
- Like a lamb.
Please tell me that your other nannies are as good with children as you are.
Even better.
- You guys did a great job.
- Yeah.
About that Mr. And Mrs. Tostig.
I didn't realize you knew Mrs. Vick.
Mr. Softy would like to say a few words.
Oh, Shawn, I really don't think that this is the time.
I thought his name was Levon.
What's that?
The bear snores really loud, he's pretty sure the turtle's really an alien, and all the monkey wants to do is play pull my finger.
Oh and somebody just put in some video cameras?
Yeah, I just set up a bunch of them.
So?
Well, they're not normal video cameras.
They're all high-techy with army-grade resolution.
What?
What's that, Fella?
Look up?
That's just a fan, Silly.
Lassie, what's that?
This is the extella 5400.
They're the baby bonding cameras, so you can check in.
The extella 5400 retails for over $10,000.
I'm fine.
I'm seeing angles and pivots and divots.
Well, no divots.
But it sure is fun to say those back-to-back.
Pivots and divots and pivots and divots and pivots and divots and Who wants to give that a shot?
- Give what a shot?
- Shots.
That's it.
Exactly.
But I don't see any shots of nannies playing with babies.
In fact, there's no babies at all.
I'm seeing jewelry boxes and safes and entrances and exits and security keypads.
But But from where?
- From the houses next door.
- What are you talking about?
There's a baby sleeping.
I'm talking about Shawn, will you stop!
Well, it's like a mine field!
I'm talking about casing out houses next door to the ones your nannies work at.
I'm talking about a string of robberies, one of which went terribly wrong when all of a sudden your witness-less crime got witnessed.
And then it became murder.
That ridiculous.
Is it as ridiculous as having a secret panel in your office where you can plan all your robberies?
You had access to each and every one of those baby bonding cameras, and you manipulated them.
Not to check on any nannies, but to case the houses next door to capture security alarm codes so you could break into those houses undetected.
I'd say that's pretty ridiculous.
Though not as ridiculous as Denise Richards playing a nuclear physicist named Christmas Jones in a Bond movie.
But still.
Look, I don't know what this guy's deal is, but we gotta go.
This guy's deal is that he's a psychic.
Who happens to work for the police.
Oh, really?
Yeah, really.
The Santa Barbara police department, which I'm the chief of.
Anybody ever tell you you look like a puffer fish?
Sorry.
- I can't believe it all worked out.
- I know.
All I had to do was get the fruit bowl assortment from Garrett bell's Jelly Bean factory and every flavor's delicious.
I'm talking about with chief Vick.
Her nephew's transferring to a nursing school in Santa Barbara.
In two weeks, she'll have her old nanny back.
Mm, pomegranate.
I wonder what she's going to do in the meantime.
Oh, I took care of that.
You mean, after I scoured the city and couldn't find anyone, you just stumbled upon a nanny responsible enough for chief Vick?
That I did.
Give me a little whoop.
Whoop.
And you gotta admit The man knows how to work a baby.
Shawn!
Don't look back.
Just keep walking.
Shawn!
Shawn!
Where are you going?
Come on, you said five minutes!
Don't you dare leave!
I'm smelling something really foul coming out of this thing!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Who is that?
Maybe only the coolest guy ever.
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
Had to do a little extra paperwork.
Let's hit it.
Sorry, dad, we were just checking out that supercop.
Shawn, that is not a supercop.
That guy is a bounty hunter.
What's that, a cop with a cooler name?
He's not cool, Shawn.
He's a nuisance.
He's a privately hired half criminal operating outside the law.
Shawn, look at me.
Shawn.
He's not about justice, he's about the money.
- But they look cool, right?
- All right, listen to me, son.
If you want to arrest somebody, you do it the right way.
You do it with a badge.
You got it?
Let's hit it.
All right, everybody, listen up, listen up!
Take a close look at this picture.
His name is Dwayne Tancana.
on his sheet.
Just did 36 months on his last beef.
But he's upped his game recently when he was charged with the murder of Isabella Cole.
Found dead after a robbery invasion at her home.
He was supposed to be arraigned this morning, but he managed to escape police custody.
He's on the run.
Considered armed and dangerous.
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yes.
How did he manage to escape?
What, are you writing a movie script about this?
Why don't you focus on the facts I'm giving you instead of compiling your own?
You know what, detective?
I got this.
It was my fault.
Tancana was in my custody at the time.
I was escorting him from holding to the courthouse.
He was cuffed, but not leg shackled.
One of the uniformed officers that was following us stopped to tie his shoe.
I should have lagged back, but I didn't.
We rounded a blind corner, he took the opportunity to head butt me, making a run for it while I was down.
Okay, can we move on now?
Time is noton our side, people.
You will all be assigned locations I want you to track and monitor.
- Mcnab!
- Yes, sir.
Where's my damn coffee?
Sir, I put it in the conference room for you, sir.
Who the hell is that?
That's Byrd Tatums.
A bounty hunter.
There's a $50,000 bounty on Tancana.
Bounty hunter there are no bounty hunters allowed in this station!
Get him out of here, now.
He was hired by the victim's husband, Loman Cole.
They wanna talk to you.
His lips are touching my personal mug.
Look, Mr. Cole, I understand how you must feel.
But you should take comfort in knowing that myself, detective Lassiter, and the entire department are doing everything they can to bring Tancana back into custody.
Oh, I think you've already done your part.
And that was allowing my wife's killer to escape.
Now, maybe you can just step aside and let Mr. Tatums do what he does.
All do respect, sir, what we did was apprehend the man, arrest him, and charge him with murder.
Yeah.
How's that working out for you?
You listen to me, pal.
This is our investigation.
And that is my damn coffee.
Well, first of all, I think we should go to the airport and brief security on Tancana's stats.
- Then I was thinking.
- Yeah, look, O'Hara.
Actually, uh, here's the thing.
I'm gonna have you stick around here, and I'm gonna go out and take care of the rest of that.
- Wait a minute, are you punishing me?
- No!
No, I'm not punishing you.
It's look, with the chief out of town, this all falls on my shoulders, so it's my call.
I'm gonna work the field and I need you here.
Oh, my god, you are punishing me.
Look, I need to be out there.
I need to find him.
We will.
I promise you.
We've got every bit of manpower on this.
- Every bit?
- Yes, every bit.
No.
No way, O'Hara.
I am not gonna do that.
We don't need them on this.
Should I dial the number or do you want to?
- O'Hara, this is my call.
- It's ringing.
- What did you do?
- You said to call.
No, I said it's my call whether or not to call.
Uh, hi, Shawn.
Um.
It's, uh, Carlton Lassiter.
So all I'm asking you to do is track Tancana and get back to me with any psychic leads, or whatever the hell it is you call 'em, on his whereabouts.
- Dude, it's Byrd.
Remember Byrd?
- How could I forget him?
He looks exactly the same way as when we were kids.
- Same vest, same Shaun Cassidy hair.
- Guys, here.
Over here.
Listen to me.
You are, in no uncertain terms, to make any physical contact with this man, do you understand?
He's highly dangerous.
He strangled her with his bare hands.
He knocked her husband out with a vase.
I don't need to remind you the reputation of one of our own is at stake.
Just so we're clear.
Just so there's no confusion, let me explain this one more time in terms I know you'll understand.
Cops are here, bounty hunters are here, psychics are here.
- We beat bounty hunters.
- By a knuckle.
Where are orthodontists on this scale?
I'm asking for your help.
Don't make me ask twice.
Give us a second.
I have a question for Mr. Cole.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
This is my partner Burton Guster.
I'm a psychic here at the department, and I have one question for you.
The $50,000 bounty, does that apply exclusively to Byrd here?
I don't care who gets the 50,000.
It goes to whoever brings Tancana in, and fast.
Thank you.
That's good to know.
You gotta be kidding me.
- My god, Cole has amazing hair.
- Shawn, focus.
- Did you smell it?
- Of course I did.
Ginger blossoms.
But who cares?
I care, deeply.
That's kangaroo paste.
- Kangaroo what?
- Hair gel.
You can only get it in Australia.
I've been trying to get my hands on it for months.
Maybe he has a contact from "down unda.
- Shawn.
- My hair's hungry for it, Gus.
Okay, Lassie!
The answer is an enthusiastic and sprightly yes.
You've got yourself a couple of bounty hunters.
# I know you know # # that I'm not telling the truth # # I know you know # # they just don't have any proof # # embrace the deception # # learn how to bend # # your worst inhibitions # # tend to psych you out in the end # Hey, man!
You remember us?
Uh, we had a moment once when we were kids.
Well, let me think.
No.
But you winked at us.
Yeah.
Well, that was probably involuntary.
I have a blepharospasm in my right eye.
It makes me twitch.
Gus and I are brand new to the bounty hunter scene.
We were hoping you had a few friendly tips for us.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Uh, stay out of my way.
Wow.
That didn't seem very friendly at all.
Look, if I play my cards right, this is gonna be my last run.
I'm gonna collect my 50 g's, and then I'm quitting the game.
I'm retiring.
What?
My bad.
Usually right when someone's about to retire, they get shot at, yeah?
Okay, I don't need you peons screwing this up for me, you got it?
I just put a down payment on a bar in key west.
Who are the other investors, Tango and Cash?
You know, it's interesting you're finding time to make fun when your pretty little blonde lady detective dropped the ball so hard.
Tell you what, why don't you boys just step aside and let daddy clean up your mess?
Look, just because we didn't go to the costume shop and get a bounty hunter's wrist bracelet and accessories kit, doesn't mean that we won't be bringing it in a big way.
Well, go ahead and bring it.
Be careful out there.
People get hurt.
Oh, and by the way these don't come in "tiny.
" We'll just get a women's large.
Wow.
I think I hate that guy.
Yeah, that's the way it usually goes when you meet your childhood heroes, Gus.
Nothing but heartache and disappointment.
Remember how sad you were when you ran into judge Reinhold at the dry cleaners?
Shawn, we need to get on this right away.
Yeah, for Juliet.
She's had our backs, now we're gonna have her back.
- Jules, you okay?
- Fine.
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm disassembling my side arm and then assembling it again.
I time myself.
It's an old academy stress exercise.
What are you watching?
Oh, it's a video that a bystander took with his cell phone of Tancana escaping from the courthouse.
Is he diabetic or does he have a heart condition?
Yeah, he has a heart condition.
How did you know that?
Oh, it came to me.
Psychically.
I just, you know, I didn't have the energy for the whole "hand to head" thing.
I'm leaning inquite nicely here.
Did Tancana have any family in town that we know of?
Yes, he has a cousin who's a short order cook at marvin's off la cumbre.
But hello, don't you think that's the first place we checked?
Yeah, hello, Gus.
Look, we gotta go.
But you have my word, we're gonna make this right.
I already told the blonde detective there, I haven't even spoken to my cousin in months.
- I thought he was in prison.
- He was.
Until this morning.
When he jumped his arraignment and escaped from the courthouse.
- He's on the run.
- Well, that's awful.
I'm in shock.
Yeah, you look like it.
Yeah, so much so you're just gonna drink some coffee, keep cooking.
Helps me cope.
- Dude,Tancana's here.
- What?
How do you know he's here?
Look at those two truckers.
They're the ones that ordered the burgers.
That's why they're grappling over the ketchup.
And look at that dude in the corner.
Waitress already dropped off the russian dressing.
Which means he is waiting on the reuben.
But look what he's making in the corner there.
Egg whites.
That's not on the menu at a greasy spoon like this, I'll tell you that much.
But it's just what a heart patient would eat to stay healthy.
- Let's get him!
- No, uh-uh, Shawn.
No.
We're bounty hunters.
That's what bounty hunters do.
We are not bounty hunters, Shawn.
I'm a pharmaceutical salesman.
And Lassiter made it very clear.
He said, "in no uncertain terms.
" These are certain terms, Shawn.
Certain terms.
Somebody forgot to drink their courageous juice this morning.
Fine.
Get in the car.
Dwayne!
Take off now!
Enjoying that hamburger, huh?
We need to get out of here.
Wait, let's stop and think about this for a second.
I don't need to think about anything, Shawn!
I wanna get out of here!
But Gus, we were there!
We saw him!
What are we gonna tell Jules?
Tell her you're gonna be late.
Uh, I think you're making a big mistake here.
We need to go.
Drive!
Drive drive drive drive drive!
You guys are toast!
You hear me?
You're toast!
Dude, we're, like, the best bounty hunters ever.
The criminals come straight into our car.
Already cuffed!
about another mile on this road, turn left on Cabrillo.
I gotta make a stop at a house down there.
Got some bad news for you, buddy.
The only stop we'll be making is at the police station.
I'm turning you in.
'Cause we are bounty hunters.
He's a bounty hunter.
I'm a pharmaceutical salesman.
That's good.
You're bounty hunters.
What is everybody's deal?
Like, what is going on here?
Is it because I'm not wearing the vest?
Is that what it is?
You know what, the truth is, I'm a psychic detective.
This is my partner, Galileo Humpkins.
You know, for the first time, I'm grateful you didn't use my real name.
All right, you one of those psychic people?
One of those crystal ball people?
Well, look into your crystal ball and see that I'm innocent.
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Right, you just rob them.
That's what I do.
I'm a thief.
But I'm not a killer.
I had a partner in this one, Gord Delbecchio.
Gord wanted me to break into the basement and disarm the alarm, so I did.
Woman was killed in the bedroom on the second floor.
- And I swear I never even saw the lady.
- Sure.
That's why you ran?
If I was guilty, do you really think I would have stayed in this town?
- That's what your attorney is for.
- I don't have some slick attorney.
I don't even have an attorney, man.
I got a public defender.
You know, I'm probably facing the chair on this one.
Why didn't you tell the cops about Delbecchio?
If I let the cops try to find him, he'd be long gone by now.
Aw, that looks painful.
So let me get this straight.
You just let him get away.
There was nothing I could do.
He drove off in a car.
Did you manage to get a plate?
No.
But it was a blue echo.
It was a child's car.
He was with those idiots, you know?
The psychic and the other idiot.
Lassie, what's happening?
It's Lassie.
Yes.
Yes, I do know what uncertain terms are.
- I'm the one that had to tell Gus.
- No, you listen to me, Spencer, all right?
You get back here now or I will charge you both with harboring a fugitive.
Do you understand?
Wow, somebody didn't drink their grateful juice this morning.
We're fine, okay?
He's cuffed.
I'm bringing him back in.
You're welcome.
Do me a favor, put Jules on the phone for a second.
- Ooh, dude!
Labradoodle.
- Where?
He wants to talk to you.
Shawn, where are you guys?
Let us send some black and whites.
You want a black and white cookie?
- Tancana, you want a cookie?
- Can't eat wheat or yeast.
Shawn, I'm serious.
Just stay where you are.
Yeah, so that we can't collect the $50,000 bounty.
I don't think so.
We're close, okay?
But answer me this.
What do you know about a Klaus Delbecchio?
- Gord.
- Gord Delbecchio.
Shawn, don't buy into Tancana's story.
We have checked out Delbecchio.
He has a record.
He used to partner up with Tancana, but he didn't this time, okay?
Just get in here.
And be careful.
Admit it, you're a little turned on by the whole bounty hunter thing, aren't you?
Come on.
Shawn Spencer, bounty hunter?
I mean, I know the psychic thing is sexy.
I mean, that's a given.
It's a sexy thing.
Shawn Spencer, bounty hunter?
It's hot.
It's hot!
Hello?
Jules?
Jules?
Is it because I'm not wearing a vest?
Is it the vest?
Hello?
I think she hung up, Shawn.
Look, we never made any actual cash from the Cole robbery.
Delbecchio kept talking about working something a lot bigger.
Said bragging, blowing about all the cash he was gonna make.
I think I know where's he's hiding out.
It's only, like, five minutes out of the way.
We swing by there, we check it out, and you'll know I'll telling the truth.
Shawn, what are you doing?
What is that face, Shawn?
I don't like that face.
I'm sensing something, Gus.
That's what I do, I'm a psychic.
I sense things, remember?
No, Shawn, you're not doing this to me again.
No, not this time.
Not with a criminal in the back of my car.
Gus, don't be a little girl about this, okay?
It's only gonna take five minutes.
I'm the one driving this car right now.
And this car is going to the police station.
Where all the police are.
Hello?
Got it.
They've got him!
Downstairs in his car!
I wanna thank you for a very colorful and eventful stint as a bounty hunter, Shawn.
But consider me retired.
Well, look at it this way.
Now you got a story if you ever go on Letterman.
Terrific.
Now I'm gonna head home, take a long nap, and wait for the bruises to show up on my wrist.
That actually sounds pretty good.
I'll come along.
It's been a long time since we've napped together.
Let's make a quick stop first.
This is not a quick stop, Shawn!
Sorry, my dad's boat only goes so fast.
I thought I was clear.
I'm retired!
Will you stop doing that?
He said take a right at Cabrillo, head for the pierto a house.
You do realize we're noton land anymore, right?
He said house.
But what he meant was houseboat.
It's not a tourist spot.
That's not a fishing hole.
There's no reason to be there.
I'm not getting on this boat, Shawn.
If Delbecchio's on the boat, he can hear us.
Toss me that rope, buddy.
Thanks.
Now, listen, I'm okay with you staying on the boat.
Just be careful of sharks.
I'm not suremy dad's little skiff is shark safe.
Dude, I'm pretty sure this is the boat from dead calm.
Great, now we have to worry about Billy Zane too?
Psychic bloodhound just couldn't leave it be, huh?
Easy, easy.
Take it easy.
I told you back at the station I'm gonna do what I have to do to clear my name.
If that's coming to Delbecchio's hideout and finding the evidence, that's what I'm gonna do.
Okay.
Why don't you just put down the fish bonker You're making Gus very nervous.
And let me do what it is I do, Dwayne.
I can help you.
All right.
Take a shot.
Thank you.
Look at that.
Money bands.
Usually used to pack 2 or $3,000 stacks.
I told you he was working on some cash deal.
Yes, you did.
I think I just found his phone.
Well, turn it on.
What do you got?
Battery's dead.
Just hold on to it.
I believe Isabella Cole was wearing this when she was killed.
That puts Delbecchio at least close enough to the body to snatch this off.
It's evidence.
Circumstantial, but it could lead to something.
It's Byrd!
- Hello?
- Shawn?
- Dad!
- Yeah, hey, Shawn.
You still coming over for dinner tonight?
Hold on a sec.
Are will still going to dinner at my dad's tonight?
Uh, look, we're gonna have to get back to you on that, dad.
- We're in the middle of something.
- Sounds like you're on a boat.
- Was that a gunshot?
- No, don't be ridiculous.
We're just we're sitting in the psych office watching a movie.
"Midnight Run".
Have you seen it?
Give it up, peons!
I got this.
I got this!
Open it up!
I will shoot you!
Open it!
Let's go!
We are out of here!
- You didn't tie up the boat?
- Me?
Last guy out the boatties it up!
Everyone knows that!
You asked for the rope!
Why would you ask for the rope if you didn't intend on tying it up, Shawn?
What are you, the ambassador of rope etiquette?
Did he just wink at me?
This time I really am gonna shoot you guys.
Shawn, if we ever get out of this alive, I'm gonna kill you!
You've got to be kidding me!
How can a man that big have so much stamina?
I'm a psychic!
I can tell you where he's going!
I told you she'd be here.
Wow, she really is taking this to heart.
Hey, Jules, you okay?
Juliet.
What are you doing here?
Catching up on some summer reading?
Gus and I were almost murdered here earlier, so we came back for sentimental reasons.
Do you know what it's like to have an internal voice that tells you what the right thing to do is all of the time and you do it, and it works and you're good at what you do, and then one day it just shuts off?
And in that moment there is no voice, and you just have to listen to yourself.
And in an instant, in a millisecond, you make a tiny, but crucial mistake and screw up so badly it affects your whole life?
No, I do not.
But Gus here might.
Look, I promise you, we're gonna find him.
And we're gonna bring him back in.
How are you gonna do that, Shawn?
Because I have been through everything.
I have combed these photos over and over again looking for anything, any clues, and I keep coming up with a big, fat zero.
So what are you doing?
You're just giving up?
No, I just have to go back to the station to deal with something.
Be my guest.
They photographed his tattoos.
Look at this one.
It looks handmade, like a prison tattoo.
Barb.
It could be a girlfriend or an ex.
We can cross check for women named Barb or Barbara who may have run in his circles.
He could be hiding out with her.
BARB Bar 13 - Gus?
- What?
You're a genius.
Bar 13 Not exactly family friendly here.
Just pretend like we're in road house.
Fine, but I'm Patrick Swayze.
Sam Elliott.
Excuse me, good sir?
I'd like to see a list of your california whites, please.
Listen, I don't know which fraternity dared you to walk in here, but you better run on back to campus before you get beat so bad, it's gonna hurt to cry.
Actually, we're meeting a friend here.
Dwayne Tancana.
You know him?
Never heard of him.
Mm, bummer.
Let's go.
Dude, I got this.
Really!
I don't think you're telling methe truth, giant guy.
I know he's here.
About yay high, covered in tats.
Pisces.
Loves to run.
Look, let's not play games.
Don't embarrass yourself with this tough guy routine.
Tell you what, I'm gonna count to three.
One.
Two.
Nice work, Shawn.
I got it!
I said, I got it.
There you are!
They came here looking for me, so I got it.
Now let'em down.
Let me go!
Let me stop!
Let me go!
You're lucky.
And maybe next time you might think about a tic-tac.
I gotta say, I'm impressed, Shawn.
Beginning to believe this whole psychic ability thing.
You tracked me here.
That is impressive.
- Dwayne.
- Mm-hmm?
What I really need from you is to let us take you back to the police station and into custody?
If you two try to take me in, my friends will kill you.
And if by somes trange stroke of luck, you manage to get me hand cuffed, I'll escape, because I've done it before.
Dude, that's what we forgot.
Cuffs.
There's a way out, though.
I'll walk out the front door with you, just the three of us.
If if you use your psychic ability to help me find Delbecchio.
Prove my innocence.
So, you got a decision to make.
Are you going to accept my generous offer, or am I gonna turn you over to my friends?
They don't play nice.
I'll do it.
- One condition.
- What?
I get that guy's vest.
All right, first things first.
Swing by the psych office, plug in Delbecchio's phone, see if anything survived the water damage caused by Gus.
Caused?
That I caused?
That I caused?
Maybe if someone would have tied up the boat, we wouldn't have been swimming around like the couple from open water.
There's one guy right there at the dock.
- Did you run the registration?
- Yes, it just came through.
It's registered to Delbecchio since 2001.
All right, good work, detective.
Gonna comb this place for Tancana's prints.
He must be after Delbecchio for some reason.
Okay.
Good.
Duck, it's Byrd!
Great, now we can't even goto our own office?
Byrd is stalking us now.
We're harboring a fugitive, Shawn.
Where are we gonna go with a fugitive?
Yeah, you can you can play with that.
Gus!
Dude, would you hurry up?
Just dry it off already.
- I'm not sure when my dad's getting home.
- I can't will it to dry faster, Shawn.
And I'm not plugging this inuntil all signs of moisture have been cleared.
I cheated death three times in the last seven hours.
And I'm not going out by electrocution.
I thought you said we were safe here, anyway.
Look, I know he'sat the grocery store getting stuff for the dinner, but I can't will him to spend more time squeezing melons, now can I?
- Really?
- Oh, hey, Shawn!
- Hey, dad!
- You're early, aren't you?
Oh, we're excited!
We're gonna eat.
- We're gonna - Guster!
What are you doing messing around with my crap over there?
Stop.
Oh, I'm just charging my phone.
I hope you don't mind.
And who's this?
Oh, this is,um uh, this is an old, uh - Camp counselor of Gus and mine.
- Oh, camp counselor, huh?
Yeah, he rolled into town, looked us up.
Gave us a call.
How fun is that, huh?
Get over here and meet my pop.
This is, uh, white feather.
Pleased to meet you, pop.
Well, pleased to meet you too, white feather.
What camp was that again?
Oh, dad, you don't rember anything from my childhood.
It's camp tiki mama jama.
- Tikihama.
- Tikihama!
Exactly!
And white feather here was very good to us kids back then.
Is Mr. White feather going to be joining us for dinner?
What are you serving?
Skirt steak.
Oh, no.
He can't eat that.
Do you have egg whites?
So I'm gonna go ahead and let you two get more acquainted.
'Cause that feels right.
- I mean,that just feels good.
- Shawn.
- And you can tell - Shawn!
about all our good times at camp Tikibarber.
I still can't get it to work.
How long do you think Tancanacan stall in there?
Not long.
Wait, I got it.
That's all that's left?
Yeah, that's what happens when you drop cell phones in water.
Shawn.
I need some paper.
All right, look, clearly he's either dropping off or picking up.
Money from someone somewhere.
So you were Shawn's camp counselor?
Camp?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Camp counselor, yeah.
Yeah oh, I remember Shawn.
Yeah, he was a great kid.
Wonderful kid.
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.
Had lots of camp spirit.
Team player.
Oh, a real stickler for the rules.
Is that right?
Okay, go ahead.
Pick a letter.
Shawn, seriously, I don't wanna play games.
- Can we just - Pick a letter, Gus.
- Shawn.
- Any letter.
- No.
- Pick a letter.
- No.
- Gus, pick a letter.
- Pick.
Pick.
Pick.
- No.
No.
No.
- Gus!
- T, I pick T. There's no T. - U. - No.
- L. - Uh-uh.
- J. - No.
- N. - No.
- X. - No.
Shawn, have you already solved the puzzle?
First of all, you're dead.
Secondly, of course I solved the puzzle.
The second that I saw it.
- Meadow park.
- I don't have a hi-top fade, Shawn.
Google Meadow park.
So Delbecchio was meeting someone in the park to drop off money?
This camp, what were you a, uh, counselor for?
Archery and drama.
Drama, really.
Like what?
Oh, original stuff, you know.
Um, musical-y things.
Camp songs, we a lot of camp songs.
Oh, really?
How neat.
You remember any of it?
- What, the songs?
- Yeah.
No, it was a long time ago.
Nah, come on, I'm sure you remember something.
I'd love to hear it.
Take me right back to my kid's camp days.
They grow up so quick.
- I don't remember any.
- Sing!
I can't.
Sing!
Oh Tikihama.
Oh what you are reaches nearand spreads out far camp Tikihama.
Great, no meadow park.
I searched everything within - You reach us near.
- Is he singin'in there?
- ING.
- What?
Gus, ING.
And I-N-G to the end.
Hit search.
To crystal lakes sing out loud Meadow parking.
Shawn.
Shawn.
Who is this guy in my kitchen?
All right, look, dad, let me explain.
No, don't, don't.
Don't say another word.
I don't wanna know.
Just get whatever it is out of my house before I have to call someone or some agency.
Gus, Gus, slow down.
What the heck?
I'm sensing we just found Delbecchio.
Well, there goes my alibi.
- What are you doing?
- No touchy dead body, Shawn.
That was really fast.
Gus, come here, quick.
- No.
- Get out of the car.
Come here.
I'm not coming out there.
- Would you get out of the car?
- Make me.
Get out of the car!
Okay, I need you to get out of the car.
I need the super sniffer.
I'm not smelling some dead guy's finger, Shawn.
Me put this super smeller up to some dead guy oh, my.
Is that Oh, no he didn't.
I'll be I've smelled that before!
I knew it!
We have got to find Byrd before he can turn in Tancana.
How?
It's not like we have $50,000 in a briefcase somewhere.
- Nice, buddy.
- What?
What?
So are you planning on letting me in any time soon on what your plan is from here?
Gus, you don't want this to be a repeat of the time.
I told you what happened at the end of war games.
You didn't talk to me for a week.
Just wait, it's better.
What's in there, anyway?
A bunch of expire deczema swabs.
It's all I could find in the back of your car.
Yo, Byrd!
Ah, Spencer, what a surprise.
Yeah, I'm chock full of 'em.
- Hey, what are you doing right now?
- Oh, right now.
I'm about 30 seconds away from collecting 50,000 bucks, that's what I'm doing.
Ooh, $50,000.
Nice, that's very exciting.
That's a lot of shot glasses that say "Byrd" on them.
Get to the point, Spencer.
And make it fast.
Well, maybe you didn't know this.
But there's a whole lot of money stashed away from the robbery.
Yeah, Tancana told us where it was.
And now all that money is in my briefcase.
Is this a briefcase or an attache?
I think it's a briefcase.
Attaches have a softer shell.
Really, that's all that differentiates them, a softer shell?
Well, attache does have a better ring to it.
Let's go with attache.
Get to it, Spencer.
Look, you said this was your last hurrah, right?
Why not make it a really, really fat one?
We'll trade you what's in the attache for Tancana, straight up.
Win-win.
Now, would I wanna do that?
Because what's in the attache attache sounds pretentious, dude.
Well, it could be the way you're saying it.
- You say it.
- Attache.
What's in the briefcase is four times more than what Cole's gonna pay you.
And for those of you playing along at home, that's $200,000.
So why wouldn't you take the money?
You allergic?
No, we love money.
Particularly Gus.
But this time we're not doing it for the money.
We're doing it for the girl.
You know what, Shawn, let's get out of here.
This guy wouldn't know a good deal if it bit him in the seat of his Han Solo action figure pants.
No, wait wait wait wait wait.
Wait.
Fine.
Toss me the money.
You think this is my first money-for-hostage exchange?
No.
First you give us Tancana, and then Gus tosses you the briefcase.
No, I wanna see the money first.
Sure, and why don't we just invite the whole police force out to count it for you while we're at it?
- Yoo-hoo.
- Same time, Byrd.
Same time.
I'll count to three.
One two three.
What the hell is this?
That was your big plan?
Really?
Really, Shawn?
No, this was the plan.
Why is he winking at me?
It's involuntary.
You got him.
Thank god.
What kind of an idiot pulls a gun in front of a police station?
Drop it, Byrd.
I have a license to carry.
I'm licensed to arrest.
Now, as much as I've thought about shooting these two from time to time, you cannot pull a gun on innocent civilians.
So drop it!
Down on your knees.
Hands behind your head.
Let's take you inside to cool off, bounty hunter.
Pass me the satchel.
Ooh, satchel!
I didn't think of that one.
I think things are gonna go a little differently this time.
Let's go.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, I doubted you guys.
It's okay.
We all make mistakes.
What do you think, buddy?
How about that nap?
Shawn, are you forgetting something?
I know.
You need a night-light.
Shawn!
Oh, right.
Whoa, guys!
Hold up, hold up!
Sorry, with the whole guns drawn thing and all the screaming and Byrd's ridiculous feathery hair, I forgot to tell you you got the wrong guy.
And it's not just a murder, it's a double murder.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- It's Cole!
It's Loman Cole!
He must have been planning on murdering his wife, because he used the break-in as the perfect opportunity to strangle her.
And pin it on Tancana, a career criminal, who would go down easy, right?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
He even knocked himself out with a vase to sell the break-in.
Because you can't be blamed for murder when you're unconscious.
What you didn't know was that Tancana wasn't alone in the house that night.
His partner, Delbecchio, was on the second floor.
And he's the one who actually saw you.
He stole the necklace off your dead wife's body, may she rest in peace.
So he contacted you, told you that he saw you kill your wife, and blackmailed you in exchange for his silence.
Delbecchio kept talking about working something bigger.
Blowing about all the cash he was gonna make.
You paid him once.
But then he wanted more.
So you set up a drop-off at the meadow parking garage.
And that's where you applied the old Cole specialty move.
The strangle.
And you might have gotten away with it if it wasn't for your own greediness.
What greediness?
I have all the money I need.
Not greediness for money.
Greediness for fabulous hair.
Unlike your poor, defenseless wife, Delbecchio fought back.
Oh, I can see it.
I can see it very clearly now!
But mostly Mostly I can smell it?
All over Delbecchio's hands.
Smell what?
Who smells ginger blossoms?
- I do.
- It's unmistakable.
It's hair gel.
Kangaroo paste.
Trust me, if you swab Delbecchio's hands and Cole's hair, you'll see that he was there.
Psychic bullcrap.
Huh?
- Do you have an alibi?
- I don't need an alibi, I'm not guilty.
Oh, well, that's okay.
'Cause we can just look at the security cameras from the parking garage.
- There were no cameras in that parking gara - Oh.
Cuff him, detective O'Hara.
Got some questions for you in the interrogation room.
I, uh guess that takes care of everybody.
Okay, Tancana, you may have beaten the murder rap, but you're gonna do some time for that robbery and that escape.
Well, robbery over murder, that's better, right?
What are you guys, pals now?
I'm sorry to break up this tender moment, but don't think I'm not gonna be really looking closely into the crap you two must have pulled in the last 14 hours.
You know, when you reprimand us, you might try using your feeling voice.
Yeah.
- Otherwise, all we hear is - The vest looks good.
Shut up.
Shawn.
Look, I really screwed up today.
And I just wanna say thank you for being there for me.
It really meant a lot.
It was a mistake.
That's what friends are for.
Yeah.
Well, it's been a long day.
Well, I guess you have to get home and feed your parrot.
Shawn, I don't have a parrot.
Well, in that case Shawn, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Really?
Because if you're doing what it looks like you're doing, it's gonna be one of those things we were just talking about.
- What's that?
- A mistake.
I agree, but that's clearly not what we're doing.
Okay.
Really?
What do you say that we're doing?
I call it very close talking.
Ah, I see.
Do you have anything else to say?
Mm no.
I think I'm good for now.
Well, good night.
'Night, detective.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
No one ever gets their ball back from mean old man Fuller's yard.
This sucks.
I know.
We were tied 114 to 114.
And I was up.
We weren't supposed to be playing with my new ball.
I'll give you 1,000 outs if you go get it.
- 2,000.
- Done.
Okay, you got it, all right, almost got it.
There I go - Gus!
- Shawn!
- Is the ball all right?
- I can't get back over.
Get that ball off my grass!
- Get out of my yard!
- Gus, I'm really gonna Miss ya.
Ho, buzz McNab.
The Christmas spirits told me to give this to you.
Oh, my goodness, a Daisy Red Ryder.
I had one of these when I was a kid.
It was the reason I wanted to become a policeman.
Well, merry Christmas from me and Gus.
Thanks, guys.
- He's gonna shoot his eye out.
- Yes, he is.
That was amazing.
How did you know that?
Uh, the room where I take naps shares a vent with the room where they do the psychological evals.
Lassie!
I - I hate snow globes.
Now, that's strange.
My psychic senses told me specifically that snow globes didn't give you nightmares about being trapped in a clear ball with snow that burns your skin off.
Well, merry Christmas from me and Gus.
Mr. Mittens says it felt just like going to sleep, and he doesn't hold it against you at all.
Kitty Heaven It's just like east beach.
That is the best news ever.
Merry Christmas from both of This is a very special gift.
It's clearly just from me.
Don't appropriate.
Not at Christmas time.
Thank you so much, Shawn.
'Tis the season, Jules.
This is exactly what I need to get into the holiday spirit before my family arrives.
Oh, should I meet them, or is it too soon?
Too soon for what?
Nothing.
O'Hara's family Christmas, huh?
My family's Christmas are the best with tradional's scolish, games and music and crafts.
You guys should totally come by tonight if you'd like.
I do love a scottish craft.
But, uh, my father and I have been invited over to the Gusters for an old-fashioned holiday dinner.
Maybe next time.
I can think of someone who could use a little cheer this time of year.
Recently divorced.
- Separated.
- Estranged?
- Embattled?
- Yes.
And all alone for the holidays.
All right!
Who keeps telling people I want snow globes for Christmas?
Dude, I am really stoked.
In over 20 years of friendship, I can count on one shop teacher's hand, the number of times your folks have had us over.
I assume it's because they can't stand my father.
Understandably.
Well, I wouldn't necessarily say that.
What would you say necessarily?
Let's just say it's not because of your dad.
Your house is too small?
- Didn't have enough extra chairs?
- No.
- Hiding a jewish family in your attic?
- No.
Wait a minute.
It's not because of me.
Gus?
I can't believe this.
I feel like pe le pew when he looked up pew in the dictionary.
Le pew.
Whuh?
No.
My parents always thought you were a bad influence on me.
- Understandably.
- A bad influence?
- Yes.
- Dude, that's absurd.
Because of you, Shawn, I got my first "B," broke my first curfew, accidentally killed the state bird How was I supposed to know he couldn't hold his own liquor?
Now I know what to get your parents for Christmas.
What?
I'm gonna lead 'em on a walk down memory lane, and give them the gift of seeing what a positive influence I have been on their son.
Dad, why do you insist on getting a real tree?
You probably chopped down some poor animal's home.
Yeah, that's the vicious little bastard right there.
- Can we go, please?
- Whoa, Shawn, Shawn?
Look, I don't wanna be late to the Gusters.
It's important that this dinner go well.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Your gift.
Go on.
Shake it, rattle it, feel it, sniff it.
Do whatever the hell you want with it before it goes in that stocking.
Then you got one week to figure out what it is.
Dad, this ridiculous competion means way more to you than it does to me.
That's why you haven't won since you were eight-years-old.
Christmas '92 was a draw.
- You know that.
- Oh, so you do care.
Go on.
That's it.
That's it?
- You're sure?
- That's all I need.
Oh, here's yours.
Merry Christmas.
- You are never - Shh.
Wait-wait-wait.
All right, time's up.
In the stockings they go.
I'm gonna figure it out, Shawn.
I always do.
Same time.
Oh, I think there's a surprise in here for someone.
I'm grown.
You don't have to do this every year.
We hear you, son, we hear ya.
And we're sure you're very happy still being a sales rep.
I am.
Pharmaceutical sales is a very desirable field.
Of course, and you're doing very well for yourself.
That's $100, boy.
No.
Not gonna happen.
Turkey's ready!
- Finally!
- It smells good, Winnie.
Why smell it when you can taste it?
Speaking of smoked turkey, you know why Gus isn't a smoker?
'cause when we were kids I made him smoke an entire pack of cigarettes, and he discovered he hated the taste.
Pretty good influence if I do say so myself.
Probably what gave him asthma.
Probably what stunted his growth too.
I'm five-ten-and-a-half.
We hear you, son.
We hear ya.
Gus, you're tall enough.
Shawn, you're an idiot, and to be fair, there's a lot of complicated causes for asthma.
Now, let's eat.
You know, it was actually Gus' asthma medication that first interested him in pharmaceuticals.
- So you're welcome for that.
- You made your point, Shawn.
- You're a good friend.
- Yes, you're very close.
So close, I wonder if he wouldn't be married by now if he wasn't spending so much time with you.
Trust me.
I get mine.
I mean I'm just waiting for Mrs. Right.
We at least thought you'd have a house by now.
I have time.
The market's still cooling off.
Yeah.
So's the food.
You won't have time if you keep using all your extra energy with this gypsy detective agency nonsense you two have cooked up.
Mrs. G. It's a psychic detective agency.
Psych.
And how does this differ from that pet baptism business you had as kids?
First of all, that was an LLC.
And I'm the one that let Gus believe that Jesus was black.
The whole time we were grow Growing up, which of course he is.
He is that.
That he is that.
I say we skip old man Fuller's house.
Nobody wants to sing to his old, mean behind.
Can't hear the song over his cussing anyway.
Oh, come on, you guys!
We're all adults now.
Can't we let bygones be bygones?
Even old man Fuller can use some Christmas spirit!
Come on!
We wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmas - and a happy new year - Mr. Fuller!
He would have been throwing rocks at us by now if he were here.
We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new Yeah, it's an apparent suicide, but, uh, we're still working the scene.
Dude, what if this wasn't suicide?
What if this was murder?
Shawn, it's Christmas time.
- Can you please leave work at the office?
- They've already moved on.
Look, there is no way that an 80-year-old man in Fuller's condition could have hoisted himself over that bannister.
And check it out.
He was clearly looking forward to watching some tv tonight.
While he ate his lobster.
- You may be on to something.
- Plus, I psych it up nice for your parents, they might be impressed, you know?
Throw in a little razzle dazzle.
Maybe they realize I'm not such a bad influence after all.
Which may get them off my case for deciding to go into business with you.
Now you're feeling me, you convertible lebaron.
Are you guys coming or what?
Sure thing, pop.
Stop!
I'm sensing something.
What is it, Shawn?
Is it like the other 26 and a half crimes we solved for the police department?
I'm sensing a struggle.
Oh, please!
Fuller's unconscious.
No, he was just an old man with a little soft skull.
Oh, someone's wrapping a rope around his neck!
What I'm sensing here, ladies and gentlemen, is murder.
Spencer, old people are always offing themselves during the holidays.
Well, according to CSU, Shawn might be right.
Colorado State University?
Crime scene unit.
- Them too.
- Let me see that.
Blunt force trauma, signs of struggle.
My Lord.
He really is psychic.
Maybe we were wrong about the boys working together This time.
Right.
Get him outta here.
It's an open crime scene, people, I need witness statements from each and every one of you carolers.
Crap, I'm running late.
Lassie, come on, man.
Handle your business.
Gus and I will take 'em down to the station tomorrow.
- We have passes - Which practically makes us co-workers.
Isn't that right, big L?
That hurt, man!
But when they cut us, we bleed blue.
Carlton!
Hi!
I'm so glad you could make it!
I hope you're in a hogmanay mood.
I doubt it.
Whatever that is.
The first footer!
Oh, the first footer, it's scottish tradition to celebrate the first visitor of the holidays.
You.
Why are they all staring at me?
Well, the first footer traditionally brings a gift of food.
All I've got is a cliff bar in my car.
I'd really prefer to save it for my morning run.
So these are my nephews.
Drake, Finn, and Isaac.
Boys, this is detective Lassiter.
He works with auntie Julie.
I like it better in here already.
I was helping them with their Christmas crafts.
It's always my favorite part.
Look at this, auntie julie!
- Look at mine!
- Oh, my goodness.
This looks fantastic, but you know, maybe detective Lassiter would like to help out.
Sure.
All right, fellas, what do we got going on here?
Well, you know, Drake, technically Jesus was born around april, so we need to get rid of this winter foliage.
Oh, and, Finn, the word manger actually refers to the wooden feeding trough that the animals used, so let's put baby Jesus in this little shot glass.
Perfect.
Well, you know, based on how far they had to travel, all the experts agree that the wise men didn't really get there until Jesus was two, so let's get rid of them.
Uh, uh, Carlton.
Remember, this is for the children.
Right.
Let's do one with Santa in it.
Hand me Kris Kringle there, guys.
That's a great idea!
You know, interestingly enough, the dutch version of Santa used slaves to deliver the toys.
We're here to give our official statements for the Fuller case.
Yes.
About that.
Um, our investigation has confirmed Mr. Spencer's hunches.
Ah, really?
- It was murder.
- That's 27 and counting.
Do you folks mind coming on in for a moment?
Just have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Chair's right over there.
I thought we could, uh, have more privacy this way.
Why?
What, is there a problem?
Well, this report says that there were traces of weed killer found in Mr. Fuller's system.
Poison.
I sensed that as well.
There's just one slight problem, we found a box of the same type of weed killer on Mr. Guster's property.
Can you explain that?
Whoa, whoa, now.
Slow your roll.
I can explain that.
Me and Fuller had a long-time feud about the property line.
And every now and then I'd poison his shrubs because he refused to cut them back.
Bill, that's not like you.
How about this?
Blunt force trauma to the head of the deceased was done caused by a bloody hammer found nearby with prints belonging to a Mr. William Guster.
Yeah, but if you'd looked a little closer, you would have found a hacksaw and a pickaxe with my prints on them too.
Fuller had been taking my tools for years.
That's another reason we'd been feuding.
Another perfectly reasonable explanation.
Just one more thing, the rope to hang Mr. Fuller matches rope - used from a boat belonging to - Lemme guess.
Me.
Dad, you're crazy.
Mr. G. Wait.
You mean it really was mine?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look, I just said that to be funny.
I have no idea how it got there.
I am sorry, Mr. Guster, the evidence is strong enough.
- You have the right to remain silent.
- What?
You give up that right, anything you say you can't arrest me!
- And will be used against you in a court of law.
- I'm a deacon in a church!
- You have a right to an attorney.
- What is the Lord gonna say?
It's very nice of you to invite us over.
Oh, Winnie, it's the least I could do.
- Now when is Bill gonna be released from custody?
- Soon I hope.
A thing like this could be devastating to somebody with delicate health, a weak disposition.
We're gonna get dad out before anything can happen to him.
I was talking about you.
Your father's strong as an ox, but you, lord knows you have enough stress to deal with as it is.
Mrs. G., you have my word, everything will be fine.
- We're gonna take this case.
- Yeah.
Shawn, maybe we oughta get some food together here.
- Maybe you oughta pass on this one.
- I can't, dad.
I owe it to them.
Look, the Gusters are nice people, okay?
They invite you over for dinner at So what?
The point is, as a rule, you never wanna get involved in a case where personal relationships are involved.
- Dad, I think I can handle it.
- What if Gus's dad is guilty?
Are you out of your mind?
How could you even say that?
That's what I mean.
Right there, Shawn.
You've already made your decision irrespective of the facts.
You have already compromised this case.
Compromised?
Why?
Because I'm not afraid of my own emotional attachment?
I'll have you know that I view that as a tool in my problem-solving, not a liability.
It is that exact kind of lame-ass thinking I can see why you were never a detective.
And I can see why you ended up a divorced detective.
My god.
We went almost three hours without having an argument.
It's our best holiday in years, huh?
Uh, I was just arresting someone in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd drop by and say hi.
Oh, you know, we just sat down to lunch, so Sorry.
Hey, guys.
Look what I've got.
A Wii!
Awesome!
Wow, that's actually very thoughtful.
Thank you.
It turned up in a sweep.
I mean, they're welcome to use it, but technically it belongs to the DA's office.
Come on!
Let's play boxing!
You're not busy?
No, no.
Go right ahead.
Oh, oh, drake, you're too slow, my friend!
You better change your name to Lassiter because I own you!
Oh, he's down on the ground!
- What a lame-o.
- Come on.
Who's next?
Who's next?
Come on!
Let's go!
Somebody come get some!
Who's next?
Get some!
Come on!
You guys sure you don't wanna take a sandwich or anything for the road?
You hardly ate any of your food.
Ooh, I remember once when we were little you made us - these chicken cordon bleus.
- Shawn.
- But the ham was so thin - Shawn!
We don't have an appetite.
All we can think about is clearing dad's name and getting him out of jail.
I'll give you a call as soon as we have any leads.
Dad.
No, it is not an engraved set of rubber bullets.
Why would I possibly give you another excuse to shoot a gun?
Well, you better keep thinking.
Shawn, I don't have to tell you how important this case is.
So whatever you need, just let me know.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
What?
What is it?
Give me a second.
Is it a clue that clears my dad?
Can you shush for one second?
I know you think this is easy for me, but I do go through a mental process.
Like A equals B. B equals C Which means a equals Would you stop it?
That's too close!
Now I gotta start all over.
Damn it, Shawn, what's taking so long?
Okay!
All right!
We need to figure out if there was a homeowner's association.
Ah, Mr. Mitchell.
- Yes.
- My name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm not interested in any fake vacation packages.
I'm not giving you my social security number so I can claim the grand prize, and I'm not paying for any damn subscriptions for magazines that I know I'll never see.
I'm the head psychic for the Santa Barbara police department.
Well, come on in then.
We're investigating the death of Mr. Fuller.
And I am sensing some unresolved conflict between the two of you.
Something something to do with rules and violations.
Yes, it's true.
Fuller became a constant thorn in my side ever since I started the homeowner's association.
He refused to follow the ordinances.
When I'd give him citations, he'd tear them up and throw them in the trash.
So I'd give him another citation.
It was a constant, vicious cycle.
It's him.
He did it.
Bust him, Shawn.
See it, see it.
See it.
Stop it.
Sounds like you wanted him out of the way.
No, no, not at all.
He was a pain, but he was our best supporter.
Our?
The Mitchell family.
We founded this neighborhood 100 years ago.
Now we're lobbying the city to have them declare it a historical district.
Fuller refused to sell his house after all these years.
We were the only friends he had.
Hello.
Oh, hi, honey.
This is Shawn Spencer and Burton Guster.
I remember the two of you from when you were no more than yea high.
You had the cutest little lawn-mowing business.
Oh, wow, that's right.
We did.
In fact I think we paid you $5.00 for a job that never got done.
Oh!
This guy.
You know, the yard tools are out back.
I'll go get them.
She's, uh She's not serious, is she?
She is.
Oh, and make sure to water the gardenias.
I've had them longer than you've been alive.
This is ridiculous.
She should've just accepted the $5.00 refund offer.
We need to be solving my dad's case.
Dude.
There's somebody in old man Fuller's house.
I can't believe we're gonna bail on the mitchells' yard again.
Come on!
Who are you, and what are you doing here?
I should ask you the same thing.
My name's Shawn.
This is my partner, Skooney "u-turn" Singleton.
We're from dirty boy landscaping.
I got a call from your office, said you needed some estimates on some renovations.
You guys are fast.
I just left word at the office saying I needed a landscape architect.
You know, I cold-called this geezer for years pushing him to sell, and he always refused.
Finally it's available.
Really?
What's so special about this place?
It's the only lot in the neighborhood with 360-degree unobstructed views.
It'll sell for a fortune.
Don't worry, this yard will be immaculate when we're done.
- Bye-bye.
- Be in touch.
You hear her, Shawn?
She's been cold-calling for years.
And she stands to make a fortune on this place.
That's motive.
Right?
Yeah, yeah.
It's gotta be her.
What more do we need?
Let's get the cops on it right away.
I, I guess it wouldn't, uh, hurt to have them do a cursory background check.
Maybe, maybe look.
Look at the phone records.
- Right.
- Okay.
I'll do everything in my power to make this process as painless as possible.
Jules.
Jules, over here!
It's about time.
Did you check the phone records?
Yep, your tip paid off.
That's great.
Thank goodness.
There were all these vibes, but I wasn't sure.
So it was Rosa.
- Who?
- The real estate agent.
No, no.
She has a solid alibi.
But we discovered quite a few calls from someone else, who also made numerous cash transfers into Fuller's account.
Possibly paying off a blackmail.
Wait a second, if you're not about to arrest Rosa, what are you doing standing here?
Distracting you.
Distracting.
Sorry, Gus.
Shawn!
Shawn!
- No, no, no, Mr. Guster!
- Mr. Guster.
Burton, Burton, please.
Don't make a scene, darling.
The neighbors, neighbors are watching us.
What is this?
Get in the car, ma'am.
Please.
- Watch your head.
- Don't!
Don't you touch my hair!
We got here as fast as we could.
This is our worst nightmare.
It seems like everything is conspiring against us.
So we lawyered up.
That's how they say it in the bucket, son, Where I did an eight-hour bid.
I don't know those words.
I'm not gonna do well in prison.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
You'll be fine.
She not gonna make it.
I told you, nobody's going to prison.
Mrs. G, why didn't you tell anybody that old man Fuller was blackmailing you for all these years?
I wanted to, believe me, I did, but I couldn't.
You see, this all started when Bill's sailboat caught fire.
I tried to muster up the courage to tell everybody that it was my fault.
But before I could, the insurance company had paid everything off already.
Well, somehow, Fuller knew the truth of what had happened.
He threatened to turn me in for insurance fraud if I didn't pay him every month.
Well, he was so old, I figured paying him off for the rest of his life was the cheapest route.
To the police it looks like motive.
I know.
But don't worry, son.
We have called Nana.
She's to look after you in case anything should happen to the two of us.
Mom, I don't need my grandmother, who lives in a nursing home to look after me.
We hear you, son.
We hear you.
Anyway, it's just until we can raise the money to post your mother's bail and pay our legal bills.
Whatever the cost is, I'll cover it.
- Don't worry about it.
- We appreciate the gesture, Burton.
But, son, we're talking real money.
You have a savings account in a penny jar.
I have a 401, a diversified asset-allocated portfolio full of securities and equity to tap into.
He's always been so good with the big words.
How much do you think we can get for the cutlass?
Stop it!
I can't take anymore!
All of my life it's been Gus can't handle this!
Protect Gus from that!
Well, guess what?
I'm the most responsible, well-prepared, non-criminal-record-having adult in this room.
And it's high time you two stopped babying me.
I'm And by the way, I know you've only been married for 28 years.
I did the math a long time ago.
So stop protecting me from that.
Starting now, I'm gonna take care of you.
I'm gonna give you money.
And we're gonna solve this case.
Shawn may not have always been the best influence on me, but he's always believed in me, even when I didn't believe in myself.
And right now, I believe in him.
We hear ya, son.
All right, dude.
You had your moment, man.
You nailed it.
Now go ahead and make a timely exit.
Come on, man.
Before you gotta make another speech.
Your mom being arrested might be Christmas miracle we need for the case.
How so?
I suspect she wasn't the only one in the neighborhood that old man Fuller was blackmailing.
We gotta get back in his house.
Let's hurry up.
This place gives me the creeps.
Bingo!
This must be how old man Fuller saw your mom burn your dad's boat.
Dude, there's something in there.
What do you think it is?
Will you stop it, Shawn?
You know how that story gives me the creeps.
Norman!
Norman!
Norman!
Okay, stop it, that's enough!
That's enough!
- Game over.
- Fine.
Don't play, Shawn.
Just as I thought.
He was snooping on the entire neighborhood from up here.
These are his blackmail pictures.
Suburban pot farm.
Bootleg DVD ring.
None of these are really cause for murder.
Covering an illicit affair.
Now that's what I call motive.
What?
You see anything?
Hurry up.
I know where our culprit lives.
Hey.
Got some questions for you about some illicit pictures.
But we already know where you live!
We call that "Sammy Floyd's tree house ambush".
Okay, okay.
Okay.
You got me.
I'll give you your pictures back.
We have pictures of you, Dude.
The ones old man Fuller was blackmailing you for.
- What pictures are you talking about?
- I work at a one-hour photo.
I thought you were asking about the pictures of hot, naked chicks I sometimes keep.
Wait a minute.
This isn't you?
No.
But it kinda looks like my dad.
From about 30 years ago when we first moved here.
Man, it was an old picture mixed in with the new ones.
We couldn't tell the difference because they're all black and white.
So we're looking for his dad?
- Yes.
- He passed away a few years ago.
No.
Who's this woman in the photo?
It's not my mom.
That's for sure.
- She died before we moved here.
- Who the hell is she?
You know, don't really feel comfortable talking about my family secrets, all right?
What's the name of that one-hour photo where you hide your filthy debauchery?
I remember my dad had a female friend who would visit only at night.
- What was her name?
- I don't remember.
- Do you know she lives?
- No.
Can you tell us anything?
I just swung from a tree.
When she left the house would smell like, white linenperfume.
I remember it because it was the same perfume my mom used to wear when she was alive.
- So our culprit is a woman?
- Apparently.
Who looked like that 30 years ago.
She's hot.
What?
You have problems.
You know, I was thinking.
If, you guys have an extra seat at that table for Christmas dinner, I might be available.
Carlton, I haven't been completely honest with you.
- You see, family - Say no more.
Don't worry.
I won't come around anymore.
I am so sorry, Carlton.
Don't be.
I mean it's.
It's totally natural for you to be jealous if your nephews like me more than you.
- Come again?
- I get it.
You're used to being the cool aunt that everyone wants to hang out with.
But when I'm around, you just can't compete with that.
Sometimes I just.
I forget to dial down my coolness when I'm around kids.
They're just so impressionable.
You are so right.
I can't compete with that.
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.
All right, I'm sure your nephews still think you're really fly.
Merry Christmas, Carlton.
Great news.
We're following a new lead on the case.
That's great because I just got my notice to appear in court just in time for Christmas.
Look at this.
An announcement for old man Fuller's estate sale.
Making people buy back stuff that was probably already theirs in the first place.
I don't know what they put in this stuff, But the jerk chicken from Kingstons has always been the best.
Let me see.
Well, they got the right ratio of black pepper, scotch bonnet, and thyme.
Hey, son.
Whoo.
I ain't mad at that.
But they should have used a quarter less pimento.
Mom.
Minced nutmeg instead of ground.
My god.
Gus, you came by the super smeller honest.
She also smelled like, white linenperfume.
Dude!
Can the super smeller pick out a scent from memory?
Well, the olfactory and memory areas of the cerebral cortex share the same neural pathways.
- What is that?
Is that a yes?
- Yes.
Sweet!
I think I know how to solve the case!
Come on!
We'll be back.
Jules, I'm getting a major psychic disturbance down at old man Fuller's estate sale.
You might wanna get down here.
Okay.
Hurry.
Check it out.
If our culprit's here, she's gonna wanna get a hold of those photos.
- Right.
- If she's like most old ladies, she probably thinks you were on the Jeffersons, and she wears the same perfume from her youth.
All you gotta do is identify who's wearingwhite linen.
- I'll take care of the rest.
- Got it.
- You ready?
- Yep.

Gardenia.

Tahitian gardenia.
- Thank you.
Now give me a push.
- What?
- Give me a little push.
- Not pushing you just give me a little.
Get that ball off my grass, Guster!
Get out of my yard!
If you kids don't keep it quiet out there, I'm gonna call the cops!
He's channeling old man Fuller's grumpy drunken spirit.
What's that?
What's that, you miserable old geezer?
The cops have the wrong suspects.
Well, then who's the killer?
Gladys Mitchell?
You used to deliver flowers To the nice little widower who moved in down the street.
One thing led to another.
The next thing you knew, you were locked in a torrid, illicit affair.
Dirty, sweaty, an affair that if it got to the public would not only ruin your marriage, but soil the good name of the neighborhood's founding family.
Old man Fuller knew your secret!
He could see everything from his snooping perch.
In exchange for his silence, you had to cater to all of his needs for the better part of 30 years.
But oh, that bastard just wouldn't die, would he?
No, it was as if his meanness was keeping him alive.
And then your worst nightmare became a reality.
He started going senile.
You couldn't risk him telling somebody about the affair, so you took matters into your own hands, and you killed the son of a bitch!
That's absurd.
I couldn't possibly hang a grown man from up there.
I can see it.
You tried to poison him!
But he spit it out.
Then you panicked.
You grabbed a hammer.
You tried to bash in his skull!
But no, he just wouldn't die!
His little feet twitching this way and that!
And then a really desperate move.
You grabbed the disoriented Fuller!
You pushed him over to the base of the stairs.
You found yourself a nice piece of rope.
You tied one end around his Neck!
You draped the otherend over the bannister and you tied it to the Chair lift.
And then you used that Chair lift to pull old man Fuller all the way up and over the bannister at this ridiculous, agonizing pace.
And that is how you killed that ancient, pruney relic.
I'm so sorry, Honey.
I just couldn't let him ruin everything that we worked so hard to build.
Guster, you can tell your parents we're gonna drop the charges.
Good work, Shawn.
You've already had your moment.
All right, let's light this puppy up.
Well, Shawn, it looks like another draw this year?
Yes.
It appears so.
Look at that.
Little Psych golf balls.
I also signed you up for lessons with the golf pro down at the Santa Barbara municipal course.
That's sweet, dad.
Thank you.
All right, your turn.
All right.
I have no idea what this is.
What do we got here?
"Dear dad, you got me monogrammed psych golf balls and golf lessons with the pro down at the municipal course".
Turn it, turn it, turn it.
I believe his name is Pierre.
I got you, old man!
That's it, Shawn, you know, this is the last year we're gonna play this stupid little game.
Somebody doesn't like to lose.
Because you're an old grinch during christmastime.
- The name is Ebenezer Grinch man.
- Stop.
Stop!
Grinch of the Cruise Scrooge grinchies.
Shawn.
Here you go.
Here's your real gift.
What?
- Wait, what's it gonna do?
- Just give her a rip.
So what's there?
What's in there?
Look at that.
That's me fishing.
In the snow.
It's snowing.
That's really nice, Shawn.
That's great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you for a lovely dinner.
I think we should be going now.
Yes.
Thank you.
It was my pleasure.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
I got a perfect place for this.
You all should get some rest.
You've been through a lot.
Finally things can get back to the way they were.
Well, almost.
I've been thinking, maybe we could use some advice about that diversification stuff.
Seem like you're doing pretty good for yourself.
And making some good business decisions.
Sure!
No problem.
Let me go get the car.
Mr. Spencer.
Shawn.
Now, you look after Burton for us.
Are you sure this is enough?
I mean, this is Gus we're talking about, right?
Don't worry, Mr. G, I got it covered.
Merry Christmas, Shawn.
Merry Christmas to you all.
Bye, Guys!
All right, all right, all right.
How did you do it?
Come on.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Come on, boys.
Sit up, sit up.
Come on, napkins in lap.
Now, listen, we don't get to go out very often, so I want you to order something special.
Harbor grill is one of the Nicest restaurants in Santa Barbara.
I'm gonna have nachos.
No way.
Dad, I think that guy over there is a spy.
And he's trying to poison her!
I don't know how to say this, so I'm just gonna say it.
Megan, will you marry me?
Y, yes.
Of course, yes!
Come on, guys, you've seen people propose before.
It's a very special moment.
Especially for a man.
You fall in love with a woman.
You decide you're gonna spend the rest of your life with her.
Rest of my life with a girl?
- No way!
- I'm never ever gonna get married!
By the way, they're not gonna make it.
Do I need to set this on slow pitch?
Hey.
I swore I saw that guy earlier.
Yeah, He's been following us all day.
I'd say worst PI, ever.
Check this out.
What the, no, he followed me into the bathroom?
That's my sanctuary.
- I know.
- All right, we gotta find out what he wants.
And we have to do it in a way that's cool and clever.
I got it.
Gyro ball!
Hey, watch it!
Let me show you how it's done.
Watch out.
That very well may be the most humiliating moment of your life.
I pitch better from the stretch.
That's enough.
Hey.
And that was for following me into the bathroom.
Okay, so you figured out I was following you.
My name is Mace Rhoden.
I'm a private investigator.
If, I might give you a little criticism, I don't think you've quite mastered the private part.
Of course, if you're going for most obvious detective - nailed it.
- What do you want from us?
I was hired to find you by your wife.
One more tiny piece of criticism.
You haven't mastered the investigative part either.
Neither of us are married.
Shawn, an I talk to you for a minute?
This guy!
Talkin' about one of us being married.
Can you even imagine that?
Why aren't you laughing?
Why aren't you laughing?
Oh, my god!
You were married?
I can't believe you were married!
Bachelor party is tainted.
I didn't get to give my brilliant speech I've been planning - since we were seventh graders.
- You have not.
- You have a book of speeches?
- I wrote those a long time ago.
You already wrote my eulogy?
I don't remember that.
"Gus is survived by his best friend Shawn Spencer and 12 cats".
Look, the speeches are not the point, Gus.
The point is, why didn't you tell me you were married?
I didn't tell anyone.
I was embarrassed.
Look, I'm sorry.
I was wrong for not telling you.
But, dude, you know when I get married for real you'll be standing up there on that altar, right next to me, as my best man.
Thank you for saying that.
I need to hear it.
You're welcome.
So who is this Harlot?
It was spring break '97.
I was in Mazatlan with some college friends.
'97?
Tell me you weren't still rockin' the sweater vest.
What?
No.
Her name was Mira Gaffney.
I'll never forget the first time I saw her.
Mira was like no other girl I ever dated.
She could get me to do things no one else could ever do.
So seriously?
You've never been skydiving?
Well, I really don't like planes.
Or heights.
Or Jumpsuits.
No, you like sweater vests.
I do.
So you're a skydiving virgin?
Yeah!
I'm gonna take you!
We'll go!
It's amazing!
You're gonna love it!
Okay.
Dude, skydiving's one thing, but how did she get you to marry her?
Three words.
Three little words.
Let's try goldschlager!
And four hours later Oh, my god.
And your best man was a goat?
I was supposed to be that goat!
Shawn, we're on me now.
You're right.
I'm, I'm sorry.
Man, I haven't thought about her in so long.
People used to call her hurricane Mira because she was this wild, beautiful, insane girl.
So who broke it off?
Me.
And it got weird real quick.
She called me, like, And threatened to burn down my apartment.
Mira really has a thing for fire?
But there's something about her.
It just stuck with me.
I have never felt that way about any other woman.
All right, that's it.
I need to meet this trollop.
You wanna come with me?
Yeah!
You bet but, dude, listen, I don't know if I can control myself around her, so you have to promise that you'll stop me from being sucked into hurricane Mira again.
Just call me the suck-stopper.
Scratch that.
Don't, don't ever call me that.
I wonder why she wants to see me.
I don't know.
Maybe she wants to introduce you to little Gus junior.
Or not.
Hold it!
SBPD!
I said stop!
Hold it!
Look out!
Son of a I said freeze, you.
SBPD!
You have the right to remain silent.
- O'Hara, how did you just.
- Just had a hunch he lived in the area.
I figured he'd try to lose us by hopping one of the fences between hope street and the 101.
Let's go.
I'm impressed.
Shut up.
Come on, O'Hara, level with me.
That was really just a hunch?
Yes, for the tenth time.
Did he, like, drop his wallet or a piece of mail with his address on it?
Have you been to his house before?
Why would I have been to his house?
I don't know.
You date.
I just happen to be good at deductive reasoning.
You know, I've been studying for the detective's exam, and the deductive reasoning part is just killing me.
- Maybe you could tutor me some time?
- Sure.
Okay.
You know, if anyone's gonna tutor you, it should be me.
After I do hold the department record for the highest score on the detective's exam.
What?
I have to go wash out the, drunk tank.
Yeah!
What, did someone beat my score?
Hey.
I heard about the collar.
Nice work.
Another case closed.
- Chief.
- Yeah?
Did someone score higher than me on the detective's exam?
I believe O'Hara did.
O'Hara?
You beat my score?
Only by a little.
How much?
Gosh, you know, I check all those scores every three months.
How come I didn't know about this?
Well, because I made detective when I was in Miami.
So you wouldn't see those results.
And I didn't wanna tell you because I know how much you hate to lose.
I do not hate to lose.
Look, we both did well on the exam.
And those scores don't matter to me.
What matters to me is that I respect you as a cop and as a friend, and I really, really hope this doesn't become a thing between us.
This is not gonna become a thing between us.
That Mace guy said this was the place to meet her.
Maybe she works here.
That wouldn't surprise me.
She's had, like, a thousand jobs.
There's nothing wrong with that.
And she doesn't just work here.
The wine is named Mira.
Maybe they name a wine after all their employees.
Remind me to grab a bottle of Leonard on the way out.
Burton Guster?
Gus.
Gus.
Gus!
What do I say?
How's my breath?
Relax.
Remember the plan.
What plan?
I forgot the plan.
How are you?
I haven't seen you in what?
Ten years?
And now look, boom, here you are.
Hi, I'm Shawn.
Hi.
I, I gave him a really tough riddle on the way over, so he's probably now just figuring out that the doctor was a woman.
No, no.
He's done this before.
He did this when we first met.
I think it's kinda cute actually.
If we just keep talking, he'll catch up.
So I hear that you guys have a detective agency or something.
Mira!
Mira!
Hi.
Hi there.
Welcome.
You look amazing.
No, you do.
- No, you really look amazing.
- No, you do.
A little bit, but, I mean!
The only thing that would have been better was if you had worn one of those sweater vests.
I love it, do you still wear those sweater vests?
Gus, I rember the plan.
This isn't it.
I know.
Let's celebrate with a drink.
Okay?
But not goldschlager, right?
- I'm in trouble.
- l right, just be cool.
And make your armpits stop sweating.
Okay, so this is our sangiovese from last year.
Goldschlager!
Gus.
So how long have you been working here?
No, no, no.
This is my family's place.
We have three wineries.
This one, a new one in Napa, and then there's the one in Spain, which of course I can't go to because I punched the bull in Pamplona.
So, Mira, what made you wanna see me after all this time?
Well, I kinda have some big news.
Is it Gus junior?
- What?
- Nothing.
I'm getting married.
Yeah, yeah.
His name is Jann, and he's from Sweden.
Although he's lived all over the world.
And I met him at this wine convention a few months ago.
Mira, that's awesome.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
So the thing is, Gus, that, our wedding chapel in Mazatlan, they actually sent the marriage license to the U. S the annulment isn't official.
So I kinda just need you to fill out some paperwork.
Is that cool?
- Yes.
- Sure.
- Yes.
- Okay, sure.
Good.
I was a little worried.
So when is the big day?
It's actually tomorrow.
On ledbetter beach.
It's just gonna be a small thing.
I kinda wanted it to be here, but he wanted at a beach.
It's really the only thing he really wants, so I think I'll let him do it.
It's kinda romantic.
And, dad!
Yeah?
Dad, this is Shawn.
It's Shawn, right?
Yeah, Shawn.
And this is Gus.
Yes, Guster.
So this is the young man that tricked you into marrying him?
Yeah.
Typical.
Mira, I need to speak to you.
- Okay.
- Gentlemen.
Only the first glass is free.
- Why don't you come to the wedding?
- Mira.
Please, please, please, please!
Come, come, come, come, come, come!
Very sweet of you, but we're a little tight.
- What time should we be there?
- Gus.
Shawn, what is wrong with you?
Mira, of course we will come.
Okay, good.
So I'm gonna go get the wedding info and the annulment papers.
I hope I don't ever say that sentence again.
Dude.
She just smelled so nice.
Don't judge me, Shawn.
I'm weak.
I can't believe late.
Look, I'm not the one that spent two hours picking out the perfect shirt-tie-eyes combo.
Finally, what the hell am I doing here?
Shawn, you cancelled twice.
You're late.
- I'm hungry.
- Look, we're gonna eat lunch.
I promise.
There may even be a grilled cheese bar and some dancing involved.
- What the crab shack?
- Change plans.
We're going to wedding.
I can't go to a wedding.
I'm not dressed for wedding.
Dad, you look sharp as a tack.
No one will even notice.
Shawn.
Shawn.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Stacy.
I'm Mira's friend.
- Is he with you?
- Yeah he's fine.
I just won him in a bet.
- I know who you are.
- You do?
You're Gus.
Gus!
We've been waiting for you.
Mira said we couldn't start until you got here.
After all, you are a very special guest.
I am?
Don't be nervous, you.
You'll do great.
Your spot's just right up front there.
Lucky.
Now get up there!
Okay.
Little tie.
He's here!
Oh, my god.
This is my wedding.
- Gus, that's crazy.
- No, it's not.
It's Mira.
It's just like her to try to pull something like this.
- You gotta get me outta here.
- Okay, relax.
I can have Mexico in four hours.
But we gotta dye your hair change your name cut off your - fingertips so you can't be identified.
- I don't need fingertips.
Excuse me, everyone.
I'm afraid we have horrible news.
It seems Jann is missing.
Yes!
That was close!
Sweet!
Sweetie pie.
It's No, I don't want the water.
Baby, it's been two hours.
I don't think he's coming.
Of course he's not coming.
Didn't show up wednesday for golf, thursday for the barbeque, yesterday for the rehearsal dinner.
Why would he show up to his own wedding?
No, dad, you know that he got called to work on those other things.
I can't believe you talked me into this.
Baby, can we at least let the people eat something?
No.
Nobody gets to eat until I'm married!
That's it, Shawn.
I'm outta here.
It's rude to invite people to an event and not feed 'em.
Somebody fix it!
Look at her in that dress.
She's so beautiful.
Dude, I gotta get you outta here.
This must be how she felt after I annulled our wedding.
I feel so bad for her.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, let's hit it.
What?
- Mira.
- Yeah?
I am so sorry to hear about Jann.
We'll help you find him.
- You will?
- We will?
Yes, we don't have any cases right now.
We're more than happy to help.
Guster!
Thank you.
Just finished my case reports for the week, spell-checked, copied, and collated, time to spare.
Good for you.
Exactly.
O'Hara, I do hope you're not falling behind on your paperwork.
Those reports look great, O'Hara.
Listen, can you translate these files into Spanish?
No problema.
You speak Spanish?
It's a requirement in Miami.
Well, there's not that very large a Latino population here in Santa Barbara.
That's so hot!
Matt!
Did you just brew this?
It's not too hot for me.
Please tell me you didn't just burn your mouth because you're still pissed I scored higher than you on that stupid exam?
No.
Hey, detective O'Hara!
Your stolen refrigeration truck from the seafood warehouse, that's a right?
- Yes.
- No, hold on.
That truck is a commercial vehicle, so technically it's a 15-250.
Excuse me, detective.
He was asking me.
Now, if that vehicle ends up in a chop shop, it's a 10-8-03.
Of course if there's reckless driving involved, it's a 23-00-1.
Watch out for the illegal transportation of hazardous materials.
25-00-1.
Okay, that's enough.
I gotta go get some paper anyway.
- You know what?
- What?
I have worked hard.
I have done everything asked of me.
I am a good cop, and I'm not going to stand here and apologize for my good score.
So you are just gonna have to get over it.
- Yeah.
I can't do that.
- Well, then now what?
Your truck.
Whoever solves that case is the better detective.
Solve your own cases.
It's a refrigeration truck.
It's practically a victimless crime.
I guess you just don't count the people who aren't gonna get their lobster and sand dabs as victims.
I'm surprised the Miami PD didn't fail you for lack of compassion.
Gus, what's wrong with me?
What is it that makes all the guys go crazy on me?
Jann was an idiot for giving you up.
You're so sweet.
Sweet.
Sweet Gus.
Yeah, he's pretty sweet all right.
His head is like a chocolate-covered honeydew.
Now, would anyone like to talk about "Jan"?
It's Jann, with a "J".
Shawn is right.
We should do that.
So this is all that I have.
I have some pictures of us together.
And a note that he wrote me.
And a lipstick from him.
Do you have any more pictures?
No.
Shawn.
Shouldn't you maybe go talk with Mira's parents?
- I'll find you when we're finished.
- I haven't finished my - It's fine.
I'll finish it.
- You don't even know how to work with Cork!
Mrs. Gaffney.
Hello.
- My name is Shawn Spencer.
- Oh, I know who you are.
You're the psychic detective helping Mira.
You know, I've always been fascinated by people with "the gift".
Uh, you're talking about this?
Well, that takes work.
I'd like to ask you a question about "Jan".
Jann?
I wouldn't know the first thing about him.
I see.
Because you haven't met him?
Very good.
This is our private wine and alcohol collection.
Oh, I see.
I have a private room for all of my hello kitty shot glasses and wild animal scat.
I have many interests.
Well, only a privileged few are allowed down here.
The wine in this room is worth over $1 million.
We've been collecting it for years from all over the world.
Would you like a glass?
Actually, I prefer my wine in a box.
I've often heard that's the best way to savor wine.
Just skip over the taste buds and go right to the gullet.
I swear, if I have to deal with another tourist today, my head is going to explode.
And David doesn't like me drinking in front of the guests.
So, uh, how did you manage to never meet Jan?
We tried to.
Several times.
Take a sip before I finish the bottle.
That's That's disgusting.
That's a $30,000 bottle of spanish sherry.
It's good.
You know, Shawn I have very fine taste, and I like my wine like I like my men White and hairy.
That doesn't make any sense.
None what so ever.
But I can see where Mira gets her spunkiness.
Phyllis, some of our guests are gonna What's going on here?
I was just explaing our frustration over never meeting Jann.
Yeah, that guy.
Yeah, every time we made plans, he would change them at the last second with that same lame excuse about having to work overseas.
I cannot believe that I shut down my winery for this wedding.
I should have known better.
Mira's choices in men have always been suspect.
Including that Guster.
And his supposedly psychic friend.
Now if you'll excuse us?
Yes, of course.
You have to finish packing your wine.
You're moving into your winery in Napa on friday, and your amazing collection will finally be on display for all to see.
- Hey, how'd you know that - Don't be intimidated, sir.
I'm just a man.
Oh, god.
- Brace yourself, Jan doesn't actually exist.
- What?
Fact, there is no record of a Jan Anglund, buyer of fine wines and food on the internet anywhere.
I did find a Jeff Anglund.
He's an albino with a website dedicated to short circuit.
- You put us on the email list?
- That's a given.
Nice.
Oh, so she was lying?
Or she really is checking into the nutcracker suite.
Hear me, Mira made Jan up.
She made him up?
What is Clozapine?
It's an anti-anxiety drug.
It's also used to treat psychosis.
Bingo.
Mira had a prescription to clozapine, but the refill date was from way back when, - and she had a bunch of pills left.
- So she was off her meds.
And off her rocker.
Even more so than her mother.
What?
Let's just say I know where Mira gets her freaky side.
I can't believe this.
I was feeling bad for Mira.
I even started to Oh, my gosh!
Shawn, she did all this to get me back.
I fell for it again.
But wait, there's more.
The pictures.
I sense something is very, very, very wrong about these photos, very wrong indeed.
Jan Anglund doesn't exist.
- Thank you and good night.
- Wait, wait, wait a minute!
Jan Jann is real.
Why would I make any of this up?
To trick me into falling for you again.
I can't believe you'd go through all of this just to get me back.
How sure are you about this theory?
Crystal.
That doesn't really work.
Very, very sure.
Then how do you explain him?
- Jann!
- Mira, honey, I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna grab a clark bar from the vending machine.
Uh, anyone else want anything?
Chief?
Jules?
Gus, you're good?
Okay.
Honey.
I looked for you at the winery, but they said you were here.
Where were you?
- You didn't get my message?
- What message?
At the hotel desk.
Look, I got a call to close this deal with these venture capitalists in Portugal.
It was for a very important client, and I thought I could get back in time.
- Venture capitalists, really?
- I'm so sorry.
I never should have gone.
I missed our big day.
I'm just glad you're okay.
Why don't we talk about this back at the winery and spend some time getting to know you.
Yeah.
- Just give me one second.
- All right.
You both.
I don't even know what to say to you.
How could you be so cruel?
Doesn't exist, huh?
That's great.
Hey, should I put out an imaginary APB for him on my invisible radio?
- I have a case to work.
- So do I. Damn it, Shawn.
You made me look like a fool in front of Mira.
Dude, you know deep, deep down that there is something weird going on here.
With Mira.
With Jan suddenly appearing out of nowhere.
I'm gonna prove it to you.
I'm gonna show you that something's going on.
No.
No more, Shawn.
Stop it.
I'm serious about this.
Fine.
For you, I'll stop.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Well, I was hoping to speak with Jan for a minute.
- Jann.
- I won't call him that.
Yeah, he's off playing golf with my father.
Ah, sweet.
- Is that it?
'cause I'm busy.
- Actually, there is one more thing.
Just between you and me, why'd you fake those pictures of you and Jan?
I may have been wrong about a couple of things, but I know for a fact that those pictures are fakes.
Jan had a shaving cut in the same place on his neck in each one of these pictures even though they were taken at different times of the year.
It's Gus' fault.
Really.
Ever since what happened between he and I, my parents have been skeptical of every guy I've been with.
Andy, Amir, Guru Anupam, Gay Andy, Anthony Does gay Andy know you call him that?
He gave himself that name.
Look, Jann and I had only been together for a few weeks when we decided to get married, and I know that's crazy, but I just believe in all or nothing.
You know, doing what feels right.
Are you following me, Shawn?
What, are you kidding me?
I spent an entire season with an interpretive dance group in Buffalo.
But, see, my parents were against this thing from the whole beginning.
So Jann photoshopped some pictures to make it look like we had been together - for longer than we had, and it worked.
- Wait a second.
You're saying the pictures were Jan's idea?
No, Jann.
And yeah, he's the one with the super-fast printer.
I gotta get that.
That's coming from the room next door.
Mira, Mira, Mira!
I said I was sorry about what happened with Mira.
I am trying to make it up to you here.
Come on, man, we haven't played golf in forever.
This is gonna be fun.
Plus, I promise to keep my caddy shack references to a minimum.
Now, I've heard this club is restricted, so, don't tell 'em you're jewish.
- Shawn.
- I didn't say I wouldn't make any.
What are you doing?
The lady's tee's up there.
Dude!
You know what would be more fun?
Starting on the back nine.
Why can't we just start from here?
I can par this hole with this putt.
Yes, yes, yes.
- Great shot.
Let's go.
- Shawn!
Shawn, get back here before I add two strokes to your score!
What's the matter with you?
Is this the real reason you brought me golfing?
To follow Jann?
I told you to drop it.
He's back.
There's no more case.
Dude, you're wrong.
Jan is the case.
- He's the key.
- You're losing it.
Gus.
Gus!
That's the PI from the batting cages.
Even you have to admit this is getting weird.
Act natural.
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
What's up?
Just playing a little golf.
Keeping an eye out for suspicious meetings between shady people.
What were you and Mace Rhoden arguing about?
That was nothing.
You know, I was the guy who hired him.
I was late paying, so he was kind of upset.
Maybe Mira didn't tell you, but I'm a psychic, yeah.
And right now the spirits are screaming something in my head over and over and over again.
They're saying, "so se prometer usar as penas".
- I don't understand.
- It's Portuguese for "only if you promise to keep your feathered headdress on".
How can you possibly do business in Portugal and not speak a word of the language?
- Why did you really Miss the wedding?
- Okay, - I wasn't in Europe.
- Yes!
Look, the truth is, I was in another relationship.
I was in a bad situation.
I had to end it before I could get married to Mira.
- You were cheating on Mira?
- No, all right?
No.
Not exactly, okay?
It started before we even met.
And I promise you, it's over now.
I know that I haven't always been a good guy.
But being with Mira, you know, it's changed me.
I realize now that she's the only thing in my life that matters.
And you may not believe me, but that is the truest thing I have ever said.
Look, I'd better get back before Mira's dad despises me even more.
Shawn I've been there before when it comes to Mira.
- He's telling the truth.
- Yeah, but he's definitely lying.
- How can he be doing both?
- Trust me.
As someone who has occasionally dealt with half-truths, Jan Brady is not telling us everything.
He's my informant.
I'll get the information we need.
Carlton, this is my case.
And besides, your tough-guy interrogation technique, it's not gonna work.
Oh, and you think sweet and gentle's gonna get info from a guy like this?
Please.
All I need is 30 seconds.
You could time me.
Fine, I'll play that game.
And I will beat you at it.
- Fine.
- McNab!
We're commandeering your watch.
- You're commandeering my - Watch.
Okay.
Now watch how I break this guy.
It's all in the eyes.
- All right.
You little son of a - Time!
- What?
I just got started.
- They're your rules.
Crap.
- Hey.
- Hi.
You look hungry.
Kinda.
Thanks.
So what can you tell me about a refrigeration truck that was stolen a few days ago?
Refrigeration truck?
Oh, come on.
All I need's a name, Rusty.
I know about pretty much every car boosted in Santa Barbara, but nothing as pointless as stealing a refrigerator truck.
Honest.
Time!
All right, cut the crap, Rusty.
We both know that you are holding out on me.
- I was eating that candy bar.
- Well, the candy police aren't here today.
It's just me, and I got at least 12 different charges I could pin on you.
So you better start giving me some good information.
I don't know.
Look, there's only two reasons why anybody steals a car.
To sell it or to use it.
Since nobody's come down to my shop to sell me your precious little truck, they need it for something.
Time!
- Don't you dare tell her a thing.
- Oh, that's great detective work.
Probably why you scored a whole point lower than me on the exam.
Sorry to interrupt, but the chief needs you for an important case.
- They took my clark bar.
- They took my watch.
- What's going on?
- It's about Mira's fiance.
I knew it.
The guy's a crook.
All right!
Playtime's over, Jan!
I've had a bad psychic vibe about you from the beginning.
Why don't you go ahead and tell us what you've really been up to?
Whenever you're ready, Jan.
Jan?
Let's do a loop.
I knew Jann was bad news.
Wow, Gus, you were so right.
Why didn't I listen to you?
We need to find out who killed him.
That's a good idea.
Dude, I have a theory.
I don't think Jan and Mace were just arguing about money.
- What else were they arguing about?
- I don't know yet.
But I want to talk to Lassie and Jules.
Let's go.
Oh, yeah, um, I'm not gonna be able to make it.
I'am go by the winery.
Mira called.
She was wondering if I would come by.
- Gus.
- I'll be fine, Shawn.
I just wanna be there for her as a friend.
- All right.
- Cool.
Oh, good.
You're all here.
I'm having a psychic vision about Jan, and I have a theory about who may have killed him.
Let's just take a step back, Mr. Spencer.
I just got the fingerprint results from the refrigerator truck case.
Do you wanna take turns with this?
Take turns?
What's going on here?
O'Hara and I have a little competition excuse me.
Competition?
It is not a competition.
Lassiter is just being a child about his detective exam score.
Wait, the DET?
I took that when I was 15.
I got 100.
- I'm sorry.
You said you got a perfect score?
- Yeah.
- And you were 15?
- Yeah.
Why?
What did you guys get?
You know, it's probably changed a lot since then.
You really can't compare it.
Apples and oranges.
He cheated on me, and then he lied to me about missing the wedding, and now he's dead.
- I know exactly how you feel.
- Really?
- Well no.
- I always knew that there was something wrong with Jann.
From the very beginning, there was a little voice inside me that said it was all wrong, but I didn't listen 'cause he had andy's laugh and gay Andy's sense of style, and your heart.
At least that's what I thought.
- What was that?
- I don't know, but my parents are gone and the vineyard's closed.
Somebody's been in here.
Yeah, I think maybe we should call the police.
Good idea.
Officer McNab, you were saying?
Uh, yeah, the lab matched one of the prints from the gold lighter that was dropped when the truck was stolen to a known convict named Marcus Ridley, a. k. a. Mike Ray, a. k. a My eyes!
It's burning!
It's stinging!
Stuff that old women carry in their purses!
- Velamints?
- No, it's more of an aerosol.
- Binaca!
- It's not a breath freshener!
- Mace!
- Yes.
Mace Rhoden.
That's right.
- Was the truck yellow?
- Well, more like a mustard, but yeah.
Oh, I'm getting another vision.
Two, two, two visions in one.
It's Gus and the truck in the same place.
Gus is in danger.
We have to save Gus!
Come on!
All right, I left Mr. And Mrs. Gaffney a message, but Gus isn't picking up at all.
- Someone give me a gun.
- No.
- What exactly is going on?
- Okay, okay, remember when I said that Jan Anglund didn't exist?
Well, technically I was right.
You know what?
Forget that.
I was totally right.
He's not Jan Anglund.
He's a con man working with Mace Rhoden, the guy who stole your mustard refrigerator truck.
Keep talking.
Well, a few months ago, they started a long con on Mira Gaffney.
The plan was for Jan to romance Mira and marry her on the beach in Santa Barbara.
But Mira's parents asked too many questions.
So Jan doctored the photos to convince them to have the wedding.
See, my parents were against this thing from the beginning, so Jann photoshopped some pictures to make it look like we've been together for longer than we had, and it worked.
The wedding was merely a cover, so that Mira's father would shut down the winery for a day.
Jan intended to leave Mira at the altar, while Mace broke into David Gaffney's cellar to steal his priceless wine collection and skip town.
But there was no robbery at the winery.
And Jan didn't skip town.
He came back.
- He had a change of heart.
- Oh, don't There's something about Mira.
Jan was telling the truth and lying at the same time.
The truth is, I was in another relationship.
I was in a bad situation.
I had to end it before I could marry Mira.
His other relationship was with his partner Mace.
He ended it because he actually fell in love with Mira and couldn't go through with the plan.
That's why they argued at the golf course.
And that's why Mace killed him.
- But why is Guster in trouble?
- Because it's thursday night, Lassie.
The Gaffneys are moving their most expensive bottles of wine to Napa tomorrow.
Meaning that Mace is stealing them right now!
Somebody give me a gun!
- No.
- Then drive faster!
That's my best friend in there!
Good!
You got my message.
Yeah, we looked.
We can't find 'em anywhere.
The wine cellar.
Gus!
Gus!
Don't shoot!
Everything's okay.
- Mira?
- Mom!
What is going on here?
What have you gotten her into?
Gus!
Don't speak.
I can tell you precisely what happened here, sir.
Gus and Mira discovered, uh, Mace Rhoden robbing the cellar.
He pulled a gun.
He tied them up.
And Gus assessed the situation and devised the following brilliant plan.
He finessed them loose.
He told Mira to perform her dragon-headed bar trick that made him fall for her in the first place, triggering the sprinklers.
They wrestled over the gun.
Mira fainted.
And we walked in just as Gus DTD'd the bad guy.
Well done, Guster.
Well done.
- Thank you, sir.
- Very impressive.
Yeah, very quick thinking.
I was just doing what anyone would have done.
Honey, let's get you out of here.
- But I don't remem - Darling, come here.
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go.
Yeah, it's time to go.
God, he's all wet.
- Dude, that's not how it happened.
- I know.
Mace's cigarette triggered the sprinklers, and he slipped and fell?
And then I may have knocked Mira over as I ran away.
- Let's keep that last part to ourselves.
- You bet.
You guys, it's been such a crazy week.
But thanks to you both, I'm gonna get through it.
So thank you.
Oh, oh, Shawn, Gus and me are gonna go rock climbing in Rattlesnake canyon.
And then I'm gonna teach him how to hang glide off Cathedral Peak.
And it's gonna be so amazing.
Do you wanna come?
You know what, Mira?
We just got a call from a prospective client.
Something about a ghost in a ballroom.
We should probably go work on that.
Is that okay, Mira?
Oh, of course.
I totally understand.
You guys do amazing work.
But I just wanna see you both before I leave.
Mira's moving to Greenland to save polar bears.
Of course you are.
- Do you wanna come visit for Christmas?
- Gus is coming for Christmas.
- I am?
- Yeah, remember?
We talked about this, silly.
Think about it.
Bye.
Thanks again, guys.
Dude, thank you for that.
And thank you for putting up with me throughout this whole thing.
- I know I was a little - Whipped.
- Gay?
- No.
- Annoying?
- Well, I was gonna say love struck but, sure, fine.
And once again, I just wanna say for the record, I'm sorry I never told you about being married.
I understand.
Now I really understand.
Besides, I've been feeling a little guilty myself.
- About what?
- About not telling you that I too was married.
What?
You were not married, Shawn.
Please.
This is a fake, right?
I know this is fake.
You photoshopped this.
Shawn, get back here!
You trying to tell me you went skydiving with a rabbi?
Shawn!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Put that down.
We're not here to feed the birds.
That's just a cover to throw your dad off.
Well, if we're not here to feed the birds, what are we here to do, grandpa?
We're here to girl watch, everything they do is magical.
Mysterious, your grandmother was a lifetime of surprises.
Now, what can you tell me about her?
She's a surfer.
She's goofy-footed.
- Goofy?
- Left-handed, but with her feet.
No, stop.
Stop that right now.
I don't want you to profile her, or tell me who she actually is.
I want you to tell me who you think she is.
What she likes.
What she dreams about.
Use your imagination.
Well, then her name is Larsa Von Lykenhoffer.
German broad, good.
What else?
What else?
And she's a giraffe wrangler and a test pilot.
And it's possible she's a manimal.
Shawn, I thought I told you to finish the dishes before you feed the birds.
Dad, Shawn's got chores that come before goofin' off at the beach.
Let me relax with my grandson.
What are you two doing exactly?
Just beach gazing.
- You wouldn't understand.
- I understand.
- You wanna beach gaze?
- Scoot over.
You wanna beach gaze.
We'll all beach gaze.
Close your eyes, Shawn.
- How many towels with red stripes?
- Here we go with the towel thing again.
Four.
Henry, do you have to drain the fun out of everything?
Dad, I want you to leave the raising of my son to me.
All right?
He's got responsibilities.
And you, you, better be two steps behind me.
'cause you got a date with some suds and a sponge.
Do me a favor, Shawn.
Sometimes you gotta let what your dad says float through the ears.
Make your own choices.
Don't take life too seriously.
Travel the world.
Meet interesting people.
Have some adventures.
Because some day you're gonna wake up and realize you're too old to do anything really fun.
Yes, grandpa.
- This isn't gonna work, Shawn.
- It's gonna work.
We've failed to get in here six times.
We haven't gotten to one witness.
We haven't seen where the missing man disappeared from.
This place is a fortress.
I think you might be right.
Maybe we should crawl.
I'm not crawling on this wet grass.
Dude.
I read an article that says 90% of high-voltage signs are bogus.
They just hang them up there to scare people off.
Good theory.
You test it.
I can't touch that.
I conduct way more electricity than you.
You know that.
Touch it.
Just use your fingertip.
I'm not touching an electrified fence, Shawn.
How about I touch it?
I don't think I like the way that sounds.
What the hell are you two doing with my stuff?
- We need tools.
- For what?
If you must ask, it's for a stakeout, okay.
We've got a tough case, and our binoculars only go up to 2x.
Well, what are you doing with my cooler?
We have to keep the gelato cold in the car.
You two girls are useless Shawn, didn't you learn anything - I ever taught you about surveillance?
- We happen to be awesome at covert ops.
We just ran into a bit of a gauntlet, and took a missing person case based in an extremely difficult place to crack.
What impenetrable stronghold did this missing person disappear from?
Glorious pines.
- Say again.
- Glorious - pines.
- The old age home?
- It's a retirement community.
- It's top-of-the-line in independent senior living, with a full-time security team.
My son, the super sleuth, can't even get himself access into an old folks home.
No-no-no-no, dad.
You have no idea what we're up against.
Okay.
I tried everything.
I tried the whole, "I'm a traveling doula" bit.
"The dingo ate my baby" routine.
Hiding Gus in a sack trick, which never fails.
Trust me.
You wouldn't have gotten any closer than we did.
Give me a break.
I'll be in that joint, crack the case in eight minutes.
Okay, yeah.
Tomorrow.
It's on.
Show us how it's done.
No, wait, just hold on a second.
- I didn't mean to - Exactly.
- That's too early.
- How about 9:00?
- 9:00's a little late.
- Come on, guys.
Let's be reasonable.
Just split the difference.
Okay?
Call it 11:15.
I'll drive.
You sure you wanna park this close, dad?
We're almost a quarter of a mile away.
Shawn, we're exactly where we should be to get a read on the situation.
I can literally see the curvature of the earth from here.
You know, Shawn, why don't you honk the horn and let them know that we're here while you're at it?
Who is this missing guy?
Oswald Chester, resident, 73 years old.
He's been missing for three days.
And what we've gathered from our client is, the community is trying to cover it up.
Your client went to the police already?
I don't know, dad.
We didn't get that far.
What?
You didn't ask the question?
What are you doing, Shawn didn't you learn anything that I tried to - All right, that's enough of this nonsense.
- No, not enough.
We've just started.
Slow down, would you?
What are you gonna do, march right in there?
That looks to be the plan.
No wonder you guys are failing so badly.
Rule number one, never make yourself known to your target.
- Rule number two - Dad, you got your glasses?
- Yeah, of course I got my glasses.
- Good.
Go ahead and put 'em on.
- What?
- Here.
Give me that.
Oh, a disguise.
Look at you go.
Right out of the private eye handbook, huh?
Here.
Put this on too.
This thing's like 100 years old.
What Shawn I look like Henry Fonda.
Allow me to apologize in advance for this.
Ah hot.
- What the hell, Shawn?
- What the hell?
- Hold this for a second.
- What?
- May I help you?
- Yes.
Pamela, is it?
That's what it says right in front of you.
May I help you?
- We are here to check somebody in.
- Really?
And who might that be?
My grandfather.
- I'm not doing this.
No, Shawn.
- Grampy.
Calm blue ocean.
- Go to your quiet place.
- I'm sorry.
But we don't accept walk-in admissions.
There's an application and a very long waiting list.
- Uh, fine.
We're leaving.
- No-no-no.
Absolutely.
- He just got in off the waiting list.
- I'm not on any damn waiting list.
Please forgive our grampy here.
He gets irate and a little forgetful.
You two are brothers?
Our father worked at Benetton.
And what's your grandfather's name?
Talmadge McGulager.
Just a moment.
Talmadge McGulager?
Brilliant.
All right, look, what the hell are you guys doing here?
This is the part where you get blindsided with plan B. It's kinda fun when it's not happening to me.
Look, I'm getting us in.
Relax, dad.
I mean, grandpappy.
This is never gonna work.
Mr. McGulager looks like we're all set.
What?
You're who I've been waiting for.
My apologies.
I'm Pamela, the chief administrator.
My goodness, you don't look remotely old enough to live here.
Grandpapa is 72.
It's true.
The thing is, he used to be a male model.
That's why he looks so young You can see he had a lot of plastic surgery done.
My, my, they have done marvelous work.
I would have guessed 59, 60 tops.
All right, you listen here, lady, I'm not a day over Opa!
You be sweet to Pamela.
She's here to help us.
She is a helper.
Sorry, Pamela.
He's gone a little How can I put this eloquently?
I understand.
A lot of our residents are hesitant at first.
Excuse me while I get some forms.
All right, how did you know about this Talmadge?
Dad, use the cane.
It really helps sell it.
Wait, wait, wait.
You had this planned all along?
I snatched this off one of the guards that tossed us.
According to the schedule, Talmadge McGulager was supposed to check in last night.
So I called Mr. McGulager and informed him that the community is infested with african gambian pouch rats.
The largest rats in the world.
Nice.
He'll be back in three days.
It's the amount of time it takes to fly in and deploy the pouch rat's natural predator.
The sudanese birch pelican.
You don't actually expect me to spend three days here.
No-no-no.
We're gonna solve it in two.
The third day is really more about reflection.
Besides, with you in here, we'll be able to get visitor's passes, come and go as we please.
All right, all right, I'll tell you what, Shawn.
Normally I'd storm outta here.
I'd leave you in the lurch.
But this time, kid, just this time, I'm gonna teach you a lesson.
I'll be your Talmadge Magruder.
- McGregor.
- McGulager.
- Exactly.
- I'll be all those guys.
And I'll have this case solved by lunch.
Considering they eat lunch here at 10:15, I'm gonna say we'll have it done by 9:45.
- You're on.
- You're on.
Mr. McGulager, why don't I show you around the facilities.
And your grandboys fill out your admissions paperwork?
That's a brilliant idea, boys.
Why don't you get right on that?
Can we fill that out later?
We'd really like to take a look around as well.
Yeah, and I have a bit of carpal tunnel going on.
We'll just tag along if that's okay.
You don't take one step past this point until all of these forms are complete.
There are two signatures which must be in blue.
I'll let you figure out which ones those are.
Lester here will check your work when you're done.
- You wanted to see us, chief?
- What's your caseload like?
- Light.
- ish.
Good answer.
Because I have a special assignment that comes directly from the mayor.
The mayor?
Really?
Yes.
There's your assignment.
- Is he a witness or something?
- No, he's just a delinquent.
He's been pulling off some penny ante vandal stuff.
Taking down street signs, crazy gluing parking meter slots, removing hood ornaments.
Nothing serious yet, but Ah, but that's how it starts.
One minute they're destroying public property and the next thing you know they're shooting cops.
- So what I need you to do is - No, I know exactly where you were going with this thing, chief.
It's like our brains are just connected on this thing.
I'm just trying to figure out how we try this kid as an adult.
I need you to dial it back about 50 notches, or I will ask you to put your gun on my desk.
What you are going to do is straighten him out.
Spend a little time with him.
Take him on a ride-a-long.
Nurture him.
Show him what a life of crime leads to.
And he gets this special treatment because?
His mother's the deputy mayor, and she doesn't want the kid in the system.
So just fix him.
Yes, ma'am.
I think all that writing gave me a ganglion cyst.
You can't get a cyst from filling out paperwork.
If the pen is wrong, you can.
There's definitely some carpal bossing in there.
We should see if they have some extra thumb splints lying around.
You know what we should do?
We should enroll you in some man classes.
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.
While you two guys were off dottin' your I's and crossing your t's, I was busy cracking your case.
It worked.
You're finally in.
- Who the hell is he?
- He's our client.
You have a guy on the inside, and you need me to get you in here, come on!
I didn't get all the clearances I was hoping for, okay?
Jervis works here part-time.
He doesn't exactly get the respect he deserves.
Hey!
How the hell'd you two get in here?
- You're coming with me.
- I don't think so.
Bam!
Say it with me, vis-it-or's badge uh-huh, uh-huh do something.
I dare you.
I'll be watching you.
We'll be gettin' watched.
We gotta hurry.
I'm not supposed to be off lawn duty.
- I'll show you where you're sleeping.
- I'm not sleepin' anywhere.
I at least got them to give Talmadge the other empty bed in Oswald's room.
Yeah, you practically own the joint.
Jervis, give him the scoop, so he'll shut up for a minute.
Oswald disappeared from this room three mornings ago without a trace.
I'm gonna ask the first question that my son should have asked.
- Have you tried the police?
- The police?
The police couldn't catch bird flu at a Hong Kong duck farm.
They blew me off just like the staff here did.
Anything else you wanna tell us, Mr. Kent?
- No, not that I can think of.
- Are you sure?
Dad, what are you getting at?
Just spit it out.
Shawn, Oswald Chester disappeared from these grounds 12 times before.
And the last three instances they threatened to throw his ass outta here if he ever did it again.
Don't you check these nutcases out before you take 'em on?
Is that true, Jervis?
Uh, yes.
Did you also happen to mention to my son that during these jaunts, the community here filled out a missing persons report.
Only to have good old Ozzie pop up the next day.
Guys, I know what this sounds like.
but Ozzie did not run off on his own.
Not this time.
And you know this how?
He was my best friend.
I could always tell when he was getting antsy, when he wanted to run.
But this time there were no warning signs.
He just vanished into thin air.
Jervis, life lesson number 20: people lie.
Then they leave without warning.
Life sucks.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
I'm getting something.
It's strong.
Leathery.
Could be alligator.
He left without his wallet.
He doesn't have his wallet.
That's amazing.
Can't get very far without cash.
Can you, pop?
Yeah, and all his cash and credit cards are still in his wallet.
- You went through his wallet?
- Of course I did.
I'm investigating this thing too, you know.
I have a theory based on formaldehyde and mind control.
Jervis, do you mind if I confer with my two grandsons here for a moment while we work through all this?
But you haven't heard my identical twins theory.
First thing tomorrow morning.
All right, Shawn, come on.
Let's go.
There is no case here.
This guy is just AWOL.
Hey, look at this.
Oswald was on prazosin for high blood pressure.
Why would he possibly leave without his partalecsdnt You can fill that prescription anywhere, Shawn.
- He went running.
- What?
He was traing for a marathon.
Those numbers are the distances he was trying to reach.
And the date that's circled is the Santa Barbara marathon.
And how do you know that?
Easy, it's the same as Val Kilmer's birthday.
We gotta figure out where he went jogging.
All right, Shawn, I'm gonna humor ya.
Let's get outta here.
Humor me?
That was spot on.
It's like almond butter with honey.
You only know that because you have an unhealthy fascination with the guy from real genius.
Okay, that's it.
You're not coming with us.
I am going down to that Nazi lady at the front desk, and I am having your in/out privileges revoked.
Oh, Mr. McGulager.
This is Meredith Cloverfield.
Hi, I'm in charge of room service here.
She's gonna check on your special dietary needs.
Now, do you have any digestive issues?
- No, no, not - Don't let him lie to you, Miss Cloverfield.
He has a very weak heart.
All he can have is egg whites and powdered dirt.
And he shouldn't have any solid foods after noon.
- Is that true?
- No, no.
My son is a liar.
- Your son?
- No, no.
I, uh, my grandson too.
Both liars.
Big filthy liars.
So how are we gonna blindly trace a man's jogging path?
We're gonna use my indian blood.
You can't get indian blood by working in a casino.
Maybe you can't.
Dude, this place goes nowhere.
If I was gonna run, I'd go that way.
Now where do we go?
I sense he'd go this way.
That's amazing, Shawn.
Man, this guy was in good shape.
Would you stop it?
He was, like, 100.
Maybe if you weren't wearing plowman's boots.
I'm not wearing plowman's boots, Shawn!
All right, looks like we got two options.
I say we go this way.
Hold up, let's think this through for a minute.
What are you doing?
I'd go uphill first, save the downhill part for the home stretch.
Plus this side gets better shade in the afternoon.
I'm also sensing some water buffalo nearby.
What is that?
Your indian blood?
They were here first, Gus.
Don't ever forget that.
- Always hatin' on the indians.
- It's not the indians, Shawn.
I'm hatin' on you.
Dude, that rock is sprayed with arterial red.
- Maybe it's roadkill.
- Taste it.
- What is that about?
- What?
My whole life you've been trying to get me taste blood.
Every time I cut myself or scrape myself, it was, Shawn, taste it, lick it.
"It'll make you feel better".
It does.
Lick it.
- It's not my blood.
- It's on a rock.
Dude.
Pedometer.
It's exactly what a marathon runner would be carrying around with him.
How far would you say we are from the community?
I would say about six miles.
- I guess we found the place where he fell.
- Yeah, we did.
Now we got a bigger problem.
If he's not at the community, and he's not here, where the hell is his body?
This is the closest hospital to the drop zone.
If someone came across Oswald's body, this is where he would be.
Hi there.
We're looking for my father, Oswald Chester.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone here by that name.
You know what?
He left his ID at home.
Can you check for a John Doe, please?
Actually, can you check all the Doe's?
Tae-kwon, cookie, play, do-si?
I'm sorry.
Visiting hours just ended.
- Looks like we're gonna have to go incognito.
- Shawn Candy striper?
Really?
I didn't even know they made those uniforms for men.
They just started.
There was a lawsuit.
I'm just saying, aim higher.
I hope you understand what a huge break you're getting here.
This back seat smells like foot.
I mean, seriously, did something die back here?
That's the smell of your future unless you straighten up and fly right.
What's your story, baby?
- Excuse me?
- It's detective O'Hara, punk.
- And that's strike one.
- Is he always like this?
Call me baby again, you're gonna get on my bad side too.
Whoa, what bad side?
All good from where I'm sitting.
Hey, unless you wanna pee in front of seven other guys for the rest of your life, you will respect the badge.
- Why don't you tell me why you're acting out?
- I'm not acting out!
- He started it!
- I was talking to the kid.
Did anyone tell you that your hair smells like strawberries?
It's peaches.
I have to buy peaches on the way home.
I just remembered.
- So, uh, Juliet - It's detective O'Hara!
- Strike two.
- You gotta lighten up, man.
You get to hang out with this amazingly hot woman all day long.
Detective O'Hara's an officer of the law.
She is a competent investigator, efficient with her paperwork, and maintains her work space in a clean and orderly fashion.
But she is above all things, not hot!
Wheelchair to admitting.
Wheelchair to admitting.
That's Oswald!
Let's find out what happened.
Medical students?
- Residents.
- It's all the same to me.
Hello.
I am Dr. Hauser.
I am filling in today.
This is my personal candy striper Knik-Knac.
- Hello.
- He's from Guam.
We will be instructing you.
Let's begin.
You, impress me.
This patient is three days post-op.
He has an open wound, which is healing nicely.
Knic-knac, get a hold of yourself.
Or I'll put you on the first raft back to Talofo.
God, that looks like roadkill.
Yeah, is what his family probably thought when they came here to visit.
Because they love him.
You know what?
I was I was thinking of something more in an older guy.
Athletic build.
Perhaps in a coma or a coma-like state.
The patient behind you's in a coma.
No sh Perfect.
Let's begin there.
John Doe.
Admitted two days ago with severe hypotension causing low brain perfusion.
Also suffered intracranial bleed from syncope and falling down.
What the hell's wrong with you?
Where do you get off using all those long, complicated words in front of the patient?
You know, when I went to school where one goes to become a doctor - Med school.
- Yes, there was something called bedside manner.
Do they not teach that anymore?
Uh, sir, this patient's unconscious.
He can't hear me.
You're wrong.
You're dead wrong.
He can hear you.
Sure, his body is sleeping, but inside he is dancing.
- He is feeling it.
- He's doing his thing.
And he hears you say all those scary words, and he retreats right back into his mind.
Now, do you wanna help this patient or not?
Of course, sir.
Then speak to me like I'm ten years old.
He had a sudden drop in blood pressure, which deprived his brain of blood.
He also suffered a contusion and small cerebral hemorrhage.
Talk to me like I'm five.
His blood pressure went boom?
- And his brain got an owie.
- I see.
- And why do we suspect foul play?
- We don't suspect foul play.
Oh, really?
You don't find anything at all strange about his condition?
Well, his BP didn't come up immediately when we administered fluids.
- And what does that tell us?
- He probably took too much of his blood pressure medication by accident.
Sometimes the elderly have to take a lot of pills at different dosages, or they take it, forget, and take it again.
But there's nothing criminal about that.
No.
No, there's not.
Well done.
Both of you.
I don't know about you, but I'm drained.
What do you say we take a fiver?
Grab a coke.
Maybe play some frogger.
Doctor, we still have a lot of patients to see.
Five minutes isn't gonna kill them, is it?
- Is it?
- We did it, Gus.
We beat my dad.
Proved our point.
Now let's rub it in a little.
Maybe make fun of his toes.
Give Jervis the good news.
- Get the hell out of here.
- I hear that.
I'm starved.
That's four in a row, Talmadge.
You're on fire!
You just broke the pines record.
For what?
Number of times jumping in without breaking a hip?
Yeah, that's funny, kid.
Hey, Talmy, who is this?
Oh, this is my S grandson Shawn and his Hey, guys, meet buddy Markowitz.
He used to be a stand-up in the catskills.
And Rodrigo Lopez, one-time number five, clearly no longer, lightweight champion of the world.
Ah, and that's my asian friend Hoo Flung Poo.
- I don't get it.
- That guy wasn't even asian.
Well, that's what makes it funny.
You mind if we steal g- pop here for a second?
Just as long as he's back in time for the cannonball competition!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, thank you.
What are you wearing?
Well, you didn't pack me any trunks, Shawn.
This is the only thing I could borrow.
Yeah, well, while you've been here playing at campcoon, we've been Busy solving the case.
We found Oswal, he was in the hospital.
Time to get you outta here.
No, no, no, no.
We can't leave yet.
- Why not?
- This case isn't over.
Look, this place is a hot bed of suspicious activity.
Hey there.
Here's your sandwich, Talmadge.
Well, thank you, Meredith.
Thank you, where's that barbecue sauce?
You know Pamela really doesn't like complainers here.
You know you Lucky.
You should see the food give my mother over at that horrible sunshine Meadows place.
It is one step above cat food.
Gee, Mer, I'd feel a whole lot luckier if the sweetest woman in the world would score me just a little teensy, eensy, weensy bit of steak sauce.
Come on.
- Your grandfather is a flirt.
- You are, ah!
That is disgusting.
You like it here.
You, you do.
That's That's why you wanna keep investigating.
Because you like the sandwiches and the adulation.
Shawn, I'm telling you.
Something else is going on here.
Dad, we found Oswald.
There's nothing left to solve.
Admit it.
We beat you because we have the sweetness.
All right, clear a path, folks.
Coming through.
It's all right.
You have the sweetness?
What about that guy, Shawn?
What about that one?
They're dropping like flies.
- You saw the bracelets, didn't you?
- Yes, I saw them.
All right, so we got three guys all living at the same place.
They all get sick, and for some reason they're all wearing the same bracelets.
What were you saying again, Shawn, about solving this case?
Soemone is treint of old timers, at glorious pines.
Three people have gotten suddenly sick there.
It could be an angel of death type thing.
You know, that is a brilliant theory.
But what you've failed to take into account is that it's five degrees hotter today than the same day last year.
Frogs can't swallow with their eyes open.
It's true.
I'm sorry, I thought we were offering up useless pieces of information.
What Lassiter here means is that it's not out of the ordinary for older people to fall ill during heat waves or cold snaps.
Look, we found Oswald when you were convinced he was just wandering around in his bathrobe.
This is our client, Jervis Kent.
I mean, shouldn't you call forensics in?
Look at wills.
Interview beneficiaries.
I learned that at the police academy.
You went to the academy?
I thought I recognized that name.
Aren't you the guy who set his black and white on fire during the academy road test?
Yeah, you shot someone's toe off at the police firing range.
It didn't come all the way off.
I saw him yesterday.
- He still has a limp.
- Spool!
Threads, thread.
I'm seeing thread.
Spinning, and, and, bobbing and weaving.
Arting, yet crafting.
Bracelets.
Homemade bracelets.
All three of them had the same bracelet.
Well, in that case, O'hara, call CNN because we've got their new lead story.
Do the doctors who've been treating any of these patients suspect foul play?
No, Chief.
Well, double-check.
Mr. Spencer, as always it's been an experience.
You know where the exit is.
I gotta finesse that do you see what happens when you act like a Jackass all the time?
No one takes you seriously.
If you do not wanna end up like that buffoon, you better learn to walk the straight and narrow.
I don't like that guy.
There's hope for you yet, kid.
And what was all that bracelet talk?
I sensed a common thread.
Pun intended.
You mean the friendship bracelets?
Those came from Chelsea.
She makes them herself in craft class.
And she doesn't just give 'em to anybody.
Dude, she's totally dancing with my dad.
Where did they learn the tango?
Grab a partner.
Meet me on the dance floor.
So you knew my friend Oswald, right?
He courted me a little.
Can I, get cutsies?
Find your own partner, Shawn.
I don't mind, Talmadge.
I haven't had this many men ask me to dance since Nixon went to China.
Hello.
My name is Shawn.
I'm Talmadge's Grandson.
I'm trying to meet all of his new friends.
Did he happen to mention that I'm a Psychic?
Psychic.
Really?
I sensed a dark cloud.
And then, did you hear about what happened to Harley?
The paramedics and all of that stuff?
Of course I heard.
He's an ex-boyfriend of mine.
You dance divinely, Burton.
Thank you.
My turn, Shawn.
So you're quite the queen bee around here?
You have many boyfriends here at glorious pines?
I've had my share of romantic trysts.
Men fall in love easily when I start taking care of them.
What do you mean?
Now spin me.
Maaaarvelous.
They call it the Florence nightingale effect.
So you're a nurse.
You must have done a lot of work here with different medications.
Well, not anymore.
All I do now is lead the heart-smart high blood pressure seminar once a month.
That's where I met Harley and Oswald.
Save me a seat at bingo.
Shawn.
Shawn, come back here!
We learned that all the victims had high blood pressure, so they might have been on the same medications.
I learned that old people are heavy.
Look, my prized students believe that Ozzie got sick because he overdosed on his medication.
Maybe they all did.
Which means either three different people all accidentally - took too many pills - Or someone else slipped it to them.
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
I overheard a couple of the guards talking about a break-in at the on-site pharmacy here last week.
Really?
You wait until just now to tell us that?
The thief got away with codeine and oxycontin.
But I think they also got away with blood pressure medication.
So that stuff was just a cover to make it look like drug-seeker.
The BP Meds were the real target.
All right, at least that gives us the how.
Now we just gotta figure out the why.
Which reminds me, gus, will you please get us those tickets for the who?
Where?
Look, we need to get a list of all the people on blood pressure medication.
- They're all targets.
- That's something Pamela would have.
We gotta get her outta there.
The real Talmadge's stuff showed up this morning.
He's gonna be here today.
I bet she'll come out if a resident hurt themselves.
Take a spill down the stairs.
- What?
- Just take a quick header down the stairs.
I'm not gonna deliberately hurt myself, break my neck to create a distraction.
Fine.
Push you.
It'll be an accident.
Does that make it easier?
What?
You have to do something.
My toe!
Hey, I hurt my toe here.
- You stubbed your toe?
- Dude, you have to do better than that.
- I'm your father.
You do not call me dude.
- Pull your weight!
Come on.
My liver!
My liver!
Oh, my liver!
It could be failing.
You go from one to ten like that?
How about a heart attack or a stroke?
My liver.
My liver!
- Oh, god, it hurts.
- Your liver is fine.
You're not even jaundiced.
Abdominal pain can be caused by a lot of things.
You're not even holding your liver.
That's your spleen.
My spleen?
It's my spleen!
It's about to rupture!
Now, now, now, now, mr.
McGulager, settle down.
Oh, it's so painful!
We need to find a list of people's medications.
I think this is it!
No, this is the waiting list.
Dude, Oswald's getting kicked out.
Tomorrow.
It says FTC next to his name.
The other two victims as well.
FTC.
Ferocious tiger what?
FTC means full time care.
Looks like all the victims need additional nursing assistance now.
What?
They get kicked out for that?
This place won't accept anybody that needs continuous medical care.
It was all in the informational handbook.
That's what's happening here.
Someone on the waiting list got tired of waiting.
Recognize any of those names?
We just found our bad guy!
What?
What?
Is someone in there?
- Take the window.
- Who's in there?
Lester!
Lester, I need the key.
This is Darryl Jablonsky.
He's currently doing a nickel at the state pen.
- Darryl.
- Meet JJ.
Call me "hell on earth".
We all thought JJ would benefit in meeting you, hell.
See, you two have a lot in common.
JJ here is also a tough guy.
He's not afraid of the law.
So what you in for?
Vandalism.
Repeated.
Vandalism.
So why don't you take his rap sheet back to chucke.
Cheese, man, because the only thing you're gonna get in here is curbed for a Chicago smile and, I'm sorry.
I just can't do this now.
Okay, I think he's got the message.
Prison is hell.
Let's go.
Can't do what?
I can't lie, JJ.
Part of my rehabilitation according to Dr. Shenkman.
I'm not supposed to be lying, and things.
So tell me for real.
What's it like in prison?
For real?
It ain't bad.
I hang out with my best friend, "White Slavery," most of the day.
We go work out.
Chill in the library.
We got the correctionson CD.
It's read by Robert Forster.
It's pretty good.
It's tight, man.
I enjoyed it.
Then we go back again.
We work out.
We eat and sleep.
We chit chat.
Play ball.
You know what I mean?
We do what we do, man.
It's, like, good living out here, man.
Okay, but the guards are merciless.
Nah, man, they're pretty cool, man.
Actually, we're having a birthday party for one of them later on today.
Hey, is tyrone baking the cake, man?
All right.
I even have a job in prison, man.
Telemarketer, man.
Best seller of this month.
Believe that.
Bam.
It's all right in here, man.
Don't worry about a thing.
You're gonna have a blast, man.
Okay, this is absolutely pointless.
Let's go.
Come on!
Thanks for nothing, Darryl.
By the way, you can kiss that recommendation at your next parole board hearing sayonara.
That's cool.
I hear we're getting a frappucino machine next month.
So, what goes 10, Bo Derek getting old!
Hey.
Is this thing on?
There is a malicious force at work in glorious pines!
The recent rash of illnesses here not an accident!
What the hell's going on here?
He's a Psychic.
Maybe he's having an episode.
Yes, and I can feel that the culprit is right here in this room, and it's you!
Me?
Well, I can't lie.
I've killed on stage.
No, no, no.
Not you.
Her!
Who me?
No, not you.
Her.
Her!
Meredith Cloverfield!
What?
A name is coming to my brain.
Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, Rhonda!
Rhonda Cloverfield.
Your dear old mother at Sunshine Meadows.
Seventh on the waiting list to get into the pines.
But you couldn't stand watching her rot away at that hell hole.
'cause there's no sunshine, and there's no meadows!
You love her.
So you tried to bump her up that waitlist.
The first thing you did, break into the pharmacy, snatch yourself some blood pressure medication.
And then you targeted the people that were already taking those pills, whose food you served.
Chelsea's bracelets practically marked 'em for you.
First up, Oswald Chester.
You knew he carbed up before a run.
It was the perfect opportunity to make him overdose.
This is outrageous.
- I couldn't hurt a fly.
- But you could.
But she did!
Almost kill two other members of this community.
A couple more people, and you and your mother would have been reunited, and it would have felt so good.
Talmadge McGulager.
Our cover's blown.
Wrap it up, Shawn.
Quick.
Check her pockets for pills!
I think she's got some on her right now!
How dare you?
Do you have a prescription for these?
Everyone here in the room with high blood pressure, your food may be poisoned!
That's right.
Spit it out!
Get some baggies, 'cause this stuff is evidence.
Jervis, baby, slap the cuffs on her.
All I've got is a Rubber band and some twisty ties.
It's fine, it's great just call the police!
Gotta go!
Peace!
Mr. Spencer, good work on that retirement community case.
Here's your check to show our gratitude.
Thank you.
And in case you were wondering, miss Cloverfield made a full confession.
I'm sorry, Chief.
This Demon Spawn is beyond my help.
I've tried threatening him.
I've tried scaring him.
I even tried bribery.
I told you kids want Xboxes, not hot chocolate.
Does anyone know how to get Swiss Miss out of silk?
Lemon wedges.
All this kid cares about is what O'Hara's wearing and where she works out.
I'm a little curious myself.
Chief, since he has some sort of strange attachment to me, maybe I should try talking to him alone.
Use my office.
Hey, you.
Let's go.
What is going on in there?
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused earlier.
And I promise it won't happen again.
Well, I'm glad I finally got through to you.
And I thank you for your time, and for keeping the streets of Santa Barbara safe.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
You look illumineous right now.
If you're quiet, you can hear the horses sleeping.
I cannot.
It sounds like nothing to me.
Dad?
What are you watching?
Nothing, Shawn.
It's your mom's stupid so up opera.
She left it on.
I wasn't watching at all.
I was taking a nap, actually.
Do you sleep with your eyes wide open?
Okay, Shawn, yes, maybe I was half watching.
Not, because I like it, but because it's educational.
Pay close attention, you might learn a little something too.
I had a vasec to my two years ago.
That Logan is probably cheating on Skye?
No, Shawn, I'm talking about sharpening your skills.
Look, watch her closely.
Tell me what you see.
She's looking into the light.
Bingo.
Looking directly into the lights makes her eyes tear up, she cries.
Seen perps do it all the time in the interrogation room.
So acting's really just a lie?
Of course, Shawn.
What, you think those goof balls on chips are really cops?
Wow, anything else you wanna ruin for me?
I don't think we're allowed to be on one of these things, Shawn.
If they didn't want us to drive it, why did they leave the key sunder the seat?
This is not how I wanna be spending my saturday morning.
Dude, Lassie called, man.
He called us.
Us, the team!
Besides, this is a real, live television studio, Gus.
What could be better?
Eating my breakfast.
I was having a poached egg with Hollandaise sauce on an English muffin.
Look, we'll solve it up quick.
You'll be back home in no time.
Hello?
Dame Judi Dench called.
She wants her breakfast back.
Did you just do the something called and want sits something back bit?
Look around, Gus.
These are my people.
- Who are your people?
- These people.
Artists, thinkers, dreamers, guy dressed as toast.
Now, if I were a crime scene, where would I be?
Here I am.
Hey, I know this place.
- This is Corrine's living room.
- Who the hell is Corrine?
It's the living room from explosion gigantesca de Romance.
- What are you saying?
- It's a Spanish soap opera, Shawn.
How do you know that?
Who are you?
What happened to my best friend?
My gosh!
And Lassiter is talking to Jorge Gama-Lobo.
He plays Vicente on the show.
He's my favorite.
He slept with Mariana at his own mother's funeral, Shawn.
What the It's on in every doctor's office I visit.
I had no choice but to get sucked in.
You had a choice.
You still have a choice.
Who's the dead guy?
That's Rinaldo Nunez.
He played Ernesto on the show.
He used to be married to Corrine.
I'm sorry, dude.
I can't believe you actually watch this show.
It's in Spanish.
Everyone in Santa Barbara is watching it, Shawn.
The tele Novela is a craze.
Okay, what ever this case is, I want in on it.
And I don't care how you do it.
Spencer, thank god you're here.
Now go home.
We don't need you.
O'Hara jumped the gun.
This thing's pretty much open and shut.
Jules.
If you want to spend more time with me, you don't have to trump up some case.
You just pick up the phone, give me a call, say "Shawn, I'm here, I've got pudding pops".
I'll keep that in mind.
Fact is, we have tape of Mr. Gama-Lobo here actually stabbing the victim on camera.
Will someone listen to me, please!
For the last time, I had no idea the collapsible prop knife had been replaced with the real one.
I believe him.
He's your favorite actor?
Really?
That felt a little forced to me.
Spencer, why are you still here?
I told you to run along.
Hurry up, ask a question that proves there's more here than meets the eye.
I have a question!
Are those delicious looking sandwiches for everybody?
Yes, for everyone working on the stage here.
Thank you.
That's it?
That's your question?
Follow up question!
- Do you have salami?
- Not by it self, no.
But as part of another sandwich with other Italian meats.
That's interesting.
I like that very much.
All right, everybody, let's bag and wrap this up.
Sir, you're gonna need to come with us for some more questions.
Help me, please.
Who ever you are.
Unbelievable, Shawn.
I ask for one case.
One case and you couldn't get us in on it.
Dude, I'm sorry.
There's no case here.
Lassie's actually right.
Your boy stabbed some dude on camera in front of everybody, look.
What?
- There's no tells.
- What?
Look at the moment when the knife goes into Nunez.
- It looks like it hurts.
- Yeah, but look there, Gama-Lobo's face.
He doesn't look angry, he looks fright.
More importantly, he looks surprised.
That is not the face of a premeditated killer.
So what does that mean?
- I think it means we have a case.
- Yes!
A big fat double-stuffed chalupa of a case with guacamole.
Yes!
That's too hard!
I hate you, Ernesto!
Die!
Come on, dude!
I'm stabbing you in the heart!
Give me something to work with here!
Okay, look, that's a very interesting theory, Mr. Spencer, but the tape is pretty damning evidence.
Chief, all due respect, he'd have to be the worst criminal of all time.
Or the smartest.
Of course he's gonna claim he didn't know the knife was switched.
Aren't we getting ahead of ourselves?
- Mr. Gama-Lobo isn't under arrest.
- Yet.
The producers have just temporarily suspended him from the show.
- They pulled him off the show?
- Temporarily.
Until more progress is made in the investigation.
But you can't do that.
He's right in the middle of an important love triangle with Corrine.
And we haven't even found out whether Serena's baby is his or not.
What I meant to say was, the man is an actor on a television program.
It is his job, his live lihood.
You can't just take away a man's means to sustain himself.
To put food on the table.
- I need to know if that baby's his.
- I have just one question.
If this is about food, I'm telling you right now, I will not be a happy man.
How do you explain the hair on the knife?
The what?
I am sensing there was a long hair in the evidence bag.
A woman's hair.
Perhaps belong in to a ted nugent impersonator.
But one thing is certain.
It didn't come from the head of Mr. Gama-Lobo.
Was there a hair in the bag?
Actually, there was.
We haven't run it through the lab yet.
Why not?
Because, chief we feel the most damning piece of evidence that tape.
The hair could have come from anywhere.
The evidence guy who bagged it.
Officer Henze is bald, detective.
I am sensing that the owner of that Hair is our killer.
Chief, you give us one day one day!
And you have our word, we'll make sure this blatant departmental screw-up doesn't bring down the entire Santa Barbara police world universe galaxy.
One day.
But the best news is, now that we're officially on the case, we have craft service privileges.
Which means all the gummy bears and poppycock we can Jam in our bellies.
But we only have one day to eat them.
Let's get to work, Shawn.
That's lance Rothstein.
Let's start with him.
He's the head writer on the show.
I saw his picture once in soap Diary magazine.
Head writer?
He's not even Spanish.
No, he was a Hollywood guy.
Used to write on Blossom.
Decided Spanish soap operas were a better reflection of the human condition.
Obviously he didn't write the Blossom where she adopted a chimp and hit the road in an 18-wheeler.
- That was Bj and the bear, Shawn.
- You tell them that line is cut.
- Don't listen to them, they're actors.
- Floyd Rothstein.
Lance Rothstein.
You have a moment?
We're big fans.
No, I don't have a moment.
I don't mean to be rude.
You have a head shot, just drop it off in the casting department right off the lobby.
No, sir.
We're not actors.
- You're not?
- Fur the shing from it.
I'm a psychic.
I don't really, not interested in getting my fortune told.
- Mr..
?
- Spencer.
Shawn Spencer.
This is my partner, Lavender Gooms.
We're here with the police investigating the Nunez case.
Mr. Rothstein, I'm Burton Guster.
We were here yesterday at the crime scene, and we know that Jorge Gama-Lobo was not responsible for the death of Rinaldo Nunez.
- He wasn't?
- No.
Shocking!
I know that.
And I don't work with crystal balls.
Make a note.
I just let that go.
It would have been way too easy.
Yeah, look, while we're talking here, a murderer is wandering around loose on my set.
Which is not comforting for someone with my weak constitution.
I al ready have here Ditary Angina and shin splints.
Listen, are you sure that you are not an actor?
Because you really do have a certain look.
What, a shallow look?
No, I have to go.
Whoa, I still have some more questions.
Look, if I do not shoot this scene right now, then later in the week, we're gonna be doing this show live.
Why don't you find me later on the set, all right?
Okay, but what would really be help ful right now is if you just gave us Mr. Gama-Lobo's home address so that we could go there and interview him.
That is not necessary.
The man has been doing this show eight years.
His wife left him.
This is his home address.
I'm sensing a hair in the evidence baggie.
Man, it just irks me!
I still think we should bring in some of other cast members for questioning.
Here's the thing, O'Hara.
It's not that complicated.
Motivation, opportunity, execution.
With Nunez out of the picture, Jorge's role on the show gets larger.
Motivation.
Knowing in advance that it's scripted that he would stab Nunez presents opportunity.
The fact that he was unmistakably caught on film actually stabbing the victim, hello, execution.
Soon as we get those lab results back, we'll be done thank you.
- Who's that?
- Pascoretti, Penny.
A newbie.
Just transferred in from the 302 out of Oakland.
It's about time.
We could use some new blood.
I hate new blood.
Of course you do.
I welcome it.
Especially new female blood.
It gets lonely here in this sea of testosterone.
Well, you go right ahead, knock yourself out.
Make a new friend.
Maybe you could have a little tea party.
Braid each other's hair, for all I care.
Hello, I'm detective O'Hara, but you can call me Juliet.
Anyway, I just wanted to introduce myself, and welcome you here, and let you know if you need any help with anything, don't hesitate to ask.
Does it look like I don't know how to write my own name and badge number?
BFF's?
Best friends forever?
Shut up, Lassiter.
Mr. Gama-Lobo we just have a few questions for you.
Call me Jorge, please.
Jorge?
Come on, that's a little silly.
That's your name.
That's cool.
We know you didn't do it.
- You do?
- We think you were framed.
This is music to my earlobes.
Do you have questions for me?
Yes, we do.
Do you know if Serena's baby is yours?
- What?
- Serena's baby.
Gus.
I'm sorry.
Are those meat balls from craft service?
Yes, Kelly knows they are my favorite.
Usually I hunger for her meat balls the way a Jackal Salivates for an injured possum but Sadly, I have no appetite for them now.
Grab the one doesn't have a fork in it.
They're still steaming.
The little whoa!
Who's this over here?
That is my family.
Yes, they are all back in Mexico.
I, left them to do the show.
- Your brother.
- It's my sister.
No, he means this person right here.
Yes, yes.
It's my sister.
No, he means this one.
Right here.
Where my finger is.
Yes, yes.
It's my sister.
She is quite lovely.
In a young Keith Hernandez sort of you must miss them very much.
Yes.
I sense violence.
An altercation.
Here, in this room.
Someone had something against you.
Here!
Yes.
Yes, Quintessa.
Quintessa Gabrielle.
She plays Corrine on the show.
She is Gorgeous.
You don't know her wrath.
She hates me.
She's like the latina Susan Lucci.
She beat me up.
I hardly think there's woman capable of that.
Bea Arthur.
I stand corrected.
Scuse us.
Would you please just, just come out and talk to me?
Go away!
I promise you, I swear to you, I will change the line.
I was misinformed.
There's gotta be another Spanish word for nipple.
Just tell me what it is.
Hi, how you doing?
I'm just going to the writers'room where it's emotionally damaging, but it's physically safe.
Let's go after her.
Whoa, maybe now isn't the best time to approach her.
You're right.
We only have a day to solve the case.
We should wait and hang out.
I'll do the heavy lifting and charm her, you grab a piece of her hair.
Grab a piece of her hair, why?
So we can compare it to the one on the murder weapon.
How am I gonna Graba piece of her hair, Shawn?
I don't know what else I can tell you.
I told the policeman every thing I know.
Policeman?
Yes, the talls curvy-like one with no rhythm.
Detective Lassiter?
- Yes, that was his name.
- Were you and Rinaldo Nunez close?
Well, we were working together, but but no, I didn't know him very well at all.
- I'm a professional.
- I see.
Was he ever in your dressing room?
I should say not!
That's strange.
I'm seeing him in your dressing room.
Are you a psychic or some kind of witch?
Okay so maybe sometimes he came to my dressing room to rehearse lines or something.
No, he's not running lines.
He's holding a feather duster, dipping him self in pancake batter.
And he's quite naked.
Okay, so she's definitely boinking Nunez.
Does that make her a suspect?
Well, she did lie about it.
Why?
Well, he does wear bikini briefs.
Sweet.
Dude.
- This isn't a hair.
- What?
It's just part of her scrunchie.
Look!
It's all elastic-Y.
It's got a piece of be dazzle in it.
It's made out of yarn.
Good work, Buddy.
Forget it, I'll figure out how to pluck one myself.
I think we should split up.
You hit the props department, see what you can find out about our weapon.
I'm gonna pop into the stage and grill lance about the quintess a Jorge relationship.
Jorge.
Camera two, push in.
Hold it there.
Go.
So this is where all the magic happens?
Yes, smell the dream.
Can I ask you a question?
I think I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna watch.
What the hell is he doing?
What, does he got a twitch or something?
I'm afraid that's called his acting.
He's only got a couple of lines.
It's always the bit players.
Is he flirting with her?
That was the idea.
He should be more subtle than that, man.
Luke, you don't seduce a woman with your for ehead and your Adam's apple.
It's right here.
It's always been here.
It doesn't start there, you know?
I mean, you're over here and then how would you do the line?
Do do what?
You know.
No, I can't, whoa, I just Well, that's the thing.
Jorge would never have known that the knife was real.
The blades are virtually identical, actually.
We build the propas close to the specs of your ave ragesix-inch blade as we can.
I mean, we do that, obviously, for the look of the knife.
But also, it gives, like, a realistic feel for the actor.
You know the size, the weight.
The texture, so on.
Here, you wanna hold it?
Go on, hold it.
- It feels real.
- But it's not.
That's the fake one.
See?
The blade retracts.
Collapses right into the handle.
You wanna try it?
- No, I couldn't.
- Come on, stab me.
- No, really, I shouldn't.
- Come on!
Go ahead.
Hey, it's fun, trust me.
All right.
Just messing with you.
Do you mind if I borrow this to show my partner?
It's for the investigation.
Okay, Shawn, this is what I found out so far.
Turns out the knife may have changed hands up to six times before Nunez was stabbed with it.
The day is almost up and we've gotten nowhere.
It could be anyone on this set.
We need more access and more time.
I think I've figured outa Pretty good angle for that Buddy.
I just need you to step aside for one second.
Maybe hit the craft service table.
Grab us a couple of those potato latkes.
I can't figure out how Kelly makes them so crispy.
I'm not stepping any where, Shawn.
Am I the only one doing any work here on this case?
I'd love to go to work.
I'm ready, I feel it.
I just I can't.
Really?
And why is that?
- You're standing right in my eye line Buddy.
- What?
Quiet on the set!
Four, three, two and action.
Thanks for coming into speak with us, Ms. Desmondo.
You're welcome.
I'm gonna get right to it.
Can you recall any in stances in which you witnessed Jorge Gama-Lobo engaging in violent behavior?
- Yes.
- Yes?
Yes.
Please tell us.
It was seven years ago, when he pushed Diego Cabrera off a Bridge in broad day light.
Wait, that happened in this state?
- When was he charged?
- He wasn't.
He beat the rap.
But there was an eye witness.
His thought-to-be-missing step brother, Juan Sandoval.
Sandoval, that sounds familiar.
McNab!
Get in here!
I need you to run all information on a Juan Sandoval.
Juan Sandoval?
Wasn't hey our common law husband?
Wait he was your husband?
Common law.
But you murder ed himby freezing his body and then shipping it to Hawaii, and defrosting it by a Volcano.
Exactly.
That was fifth season, episode eleven.
I'm a fan.
Are you two talking about the show?
I'm talking about a real murder.
I actually saw that episode.
But he came backin season six, right?
As the chief surgeon, so that he could change Velma's face so that you could take the rap for Beatrice's murder!
It's the only episode I saw.
Who writes this crap?
The writers are all so colorfuland brilliant.
They're wonderful with the brutal crimes.
They are some kind of geniuses, I swear.
Some kind of murder geniuses maybe.
I have a package for you special delivery It says 'handle with care' He's really got something, am I right?
Yes, he's my muse.
Cut.
Easy!
That's what happens when you hire people off the street.
She's sweet.
Sweet like Mariah Careyon a Bender.
- How'd that look?
- Okay.
Don't take this the wrong way, but I think it lacked some passion.
- Passion.
- Yes.
Do you have any idea how many pages we shot today?
83.
And I'm getting by with the Spanish I learned from Charo on love boat.
Plus I gotta make it look passionate?
And look for clues?
Don't get me wrong.
I'm pulling it off quite Nicely.
I got a hair off Quintessa's head.
- Because our dressing rooms, side by side.
- Nice.
How many times do you two need to be told you are not needed on this case?
You are wasting the department's resources.
Hey, pal!
Please escort these two off the premises.
- Well, uh - Uh is not an action word.
Now drop the Joe and take them out of here.
Well, actually, this coffee's for Mr. Spencer.
- Thank you, Roger.
- Mr. Spencer?
- Well, uh, Chad, I guess.
- What?
Here, these pineapple peking dumplings are special for you, Chad.
Thank you, Kelly, you sweet little thing.
No.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave the stage area.
- We're about to roll.
- You don't wanna touch me.
Roger, it's okay.
Before you go you might want to send this down to your boys at the lab.
It's a hair off Quintessa Gabrielle's head.
The same color and lengt has the one found on the murder weapon.
I think you'll find it's a sweet, sweet match.
Oh, yes.
I'll get right on that.
- Why would you do that?
- The hair from the knife was synthetic.
It came from a wig.
Quintessa Gabrielle's hair is real.
So there's no match.
But nice work.
Chad.
What kind of show do you think we're doing?
Gotta keep it grounded, you gotta keep it real.
Wanna go back to being an intern?
Excuse me, I am doing something here.
Not nothing.
She's already making love to her nephew.
She can't also be a nun.
Yes, can I help you?
Very quickly.
I have a warrant to search these premises, confiscate all scripts and written material.
On what grounds?
On the grounds you've all been very busy thinking up ingenious ways to kill people.
All that, plus the latest in local sports with Dan the man, coming up at 11:00 P. M. What the hell?
- Jorge Gama-Lobo tried to kill himself?
- Tried and failed.
Must have been so wracked with guilt over stabbing Nunez, he decided to off himself.
- Did he leave a note?
- Oh, yeah.
Admitting to the murder.
It's already with the boys down at the lab.
I just wanted to get in there, get a verbal confession.
You've got to be kidding me.
Step away from the bed now!
Don't you shush me!
I was about to say there's still time for you to go downstairs to the gift shop and buy something.
- Maybe a teddy bear.
- Oh, that's nice.
Teddy bears are cute.
They have one with a jar of honey that says, "bee well".
I mean it, this time I will arrest you for interfering in police business.
I'm gonna have to ask you two to leave.
- This man is very sick, and I need quiet in here.
- Us?
Excuse me, I'm detective O'Hara and this is detective Lassiter and we're investigating this man.
And I demand you remove these men from this room.
Honey, the only people actually authorized to be in here are Mr. Spencer and Mr. Guster.
They're on Mr. Gama-Lobo's friends and family list.
- Everyone else out.
- You just met him a week ago.
His whole family is back in Mexico.
His older brother misses him very much.
- His sister.
- Right.
How does he make friends so fast?
I get that Jorge was depressed about being off the show, but murder/suicide/coma?
This whole thing is starting to feel like a real soap opera to me.
I can't believe he would take his own life.
Unless he was wearing a wig he didn't.
Someone else did.
What?
I don't get it.
Really?
I thought I wrapped it up so nicely for you just now.
It felt really good.
It was organic.
Synthetic hair.
Just like the one found on the knife.
So?
Dude.
It means the same person was there when Jorge tried "to kill himself".
He wasn't alone.
So wait you're saying - he didn't try to kill himself?
- I can't do this.
You're not being clear, Shawn.
Come on, dude.
I gave it to you three different ways.
Did he or did he not try to kill himself?
Is that the Gama-Lobo suicide note?
Yes, but I'm still waiting on the hand writing samples from the lab.
Nah, forget that.
Just read it to me.
Okay, "dear world, I ask for forgiveness for the sins I have committed against humanity.
"It was my hands that carried out a heinous murder".
Wait a minute.
Hold on a second.
- I know that.
- You know that?
I have been literally poring over these things for days.
Hold on a second.
Okay, continue.
"How can I go back and reverse time?
"I have no choice but to say good-bye " to a world I turned my back on and the woman I betrayed".
- Wow, it's from a script?
- Word for word.
Written by Lance Rothstein.
So Lance set him up.
What, did he just get lazy?
Did he think no one would remember?
He's gonna have plenty of time to figure out new plot lines behind bars.
So this is what it feels like to be in jail.
I always wondered if I'd survive.
- I was in jail once.
- Really this is what it was like for you too?
Yeah.
Yeah, pretty much.
You know, I mean, these phones aren't real.
No, course not.
I mean, you know, it would be too expensive.
But I mean for Ernesto's prison scene tomorrow, it's great, right?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Lance Rothstein, you're under arrest.
- For what?
- The murder of Rinaldo Nunez.
Don't worry, I can get you off on that one.
And the attempted murder of Jorge Gama-Lobo.
Ooh, I don't know about that one.
Don't get up.
I'm not staying.
We just had a huge breakin that murder case I was working on.
So now the paperwork.
I just wanted to stop by and give you this.
What is that?
- A cupcake.
- I can see that but why are you giving it to me?
I noticed that you were eating one with your lunch the other day, so I stopped and bought you one.
Same kind, red velvet.
You, um you noticed what I was eating.
Well, yeah, I'm a detective.
- I notice details.
- Really?
What else did you notice about me?
Well, I notice that you eat by yourself every day.
I notice that you hesitate to make eye contact with people.
And, well, you can be a little abrasive.
But, you know, that's probably just because it's hard to adapt.
You know, lots of politics.
It's hard to understand where everyone's coming from.
Don't worry.
I think I'm getting a pretty good idea.
Good.
I'm glad.
Dad!
You're here!
I am.
You have to try this sandwich.
- Kelly from craft service makes them for me.
- I already ate lunch, Shawn.
Why am I here?
This isn't lunch.
This is turkey with stuffing and cranberry.
It's like thanks giving between two slices of bread.
This whole place is like leaving Las Vegas with food.
Shawn, why'd you ask me here?
I thought you'd enjoy it.
You said you never had the opportunity to visit me when I was working a real job, and now I have a real job!
- Shawn, this is not a real job.
- Sure it is.
Oh no, I think I got make-upon this t-shirt.
Has anyone seen Ivan?
Acting is not a real job, Shawn.
I mean, how much attention do you need?
I'm not doing this for the attention.
I happen to be solving a case.
A murder.
This is serious business.
I've got a guy sitting in jail.
Lassiter's got some evidence against him, but I know he didn't do it.
It doesn't make any sense.
He's a writer.
He's got no motive.
Well, motive is everything.
No motive, no conviction.
How do you have fans?
This is asinine.
You started on the show five days ago.
- Look, I have something.
- Did you ever think that maybe this is embarrassing for me?
- Embarrassing for you?
- First off, your accent is terrible.
It's disgraceful, really.
You sound like that el pollo loco guy.
And then, there you go, turning your back on Rinaldo, even after he defended you when you were accused of Maria's kidnapping come on.
First of all, I am trying to sound like the el pollo loco guy.
And secondly, Rinaldo turned his back on me when he slept with Maria in the first place.
Oh, come on, he would have given you half the reward money!
Where's your integrity?
It makes you look like such a bad person.
I'm Shawn.
Those are things that my character Chad did.
I play him on tv.
It's Shawn.
Shawny.
Look into your boy's eyes.
It's me, papa.
Don't be an idiot.
I'm not one of your fans.
I barely even like you.
That's it.
If my own father can blur the lines between the show and reality, why couldn't someone else?
We've been looking in the wrong place.
It's fans.
Okay, so you've narrowed it down to 150 suspects.
Good work, Shawn.
I want your baby!
I want your baby!
I don't have any female fans?
Listen, Lance.
Lassiter doesn't have enough to make this arrest stick.
He's just hoping that a couple nights in jail will get you to confess.
A couple nights?
No, no, no, no.
Here's the thing.
I actually like it in here.
This is fuel for the show.
It's fuel for me.
I always felt there was something holding me back as a writer.
I grew up in Beverly Hills.
And I always felt that I lacked any real life experience.
Shawn, this is so good for me.
It's like Hemingway, like Ellroy, Steinbeck.
Danielle Steel.
- Ethan Hawke.
- Judy Blume.
Exactly.
I can wallow in the harsh under belly of prison life.
And shake it up a little bit with the riff-raff.
Uh, the riff-raff?
This is the Santa Barbara jail.
Not San Quentin.
It was written up in fodor's last year as a nice spa alternative.
We need to get you out of here so you can write the show.
Everyone needs you.
No, no, no, I can write in here.
I can scratch it out with a broken piece of lead in the dark.
And then I can bury myself in the one non-down pillow they issued meand I can cry myself to sleep.
Look, we need to talk about Corrine.
- Corrine?
- Corrine.
- Oh, Corrine.
- Yes, it came to me in a vision.
The murderer is doing this to protect her.
Think about it.
First, Ernesto cheated on her.
And was stabbed and killed.
Then you wrote that Vincente be trayed her and went missing.
Someone took it into their own hands and tried to kill him.
Well, not Vincente, but Jorge.
That's my point.
They can't tell the difference.
- It's a fan.
- That's interesting.
I'm not disagreeing, but what's act two?
I mean, let's say it is just one fan.
How you gonna find one fan among thousands?
Easy.
That's where you come in.
You just write me a storyline where I put Corrine's life in Jeopardy.
Then we won't have to go looking for the murderer.
The murderer will come looking for me.
You wanted to see me, chief?
Is there a problem?
Did the Rothstein arrest not stick?
This isn't about the Nunez case.
This is about the new transfer, Penny Pascoretti.
Wanted to hear your side.
My side?
My side of what?
Well, I don't know a delicate way to put this.
Ms. Pascoretti has filed an interdepartmental harassment charge against you.
What?
That's outrageous!
Is there any truth to this claim?
I was just being nice.
Reaching out.
I bought her a cupcake.
- Sue me.
- She is.
What do you mean you bought her a cupcake?
With this piece of information, you're lucky the charge didn't include a stalking claim.
I was just trying to make a friend.
I'm going to give you a piece of advice.
And take it.
As a woman in this department, you have to be very careful how you go about forming friendships.
Women in the line of police work are more cautious by nature and necessity, and slow to trust.
Well, if that's the case, I guess no woman has a friend in the department.
That's right.
Oh, 'cause I kind of thought we were friends.
Well, you were wrong.
I'll talk to Ms. Pascoretti and see what I can do to mitigate these charges.
But in the meantime, stop buying pastries.
You're excused.
Nice blouse.
Thanks.
I got it at nord strom, it was on the sale rack.
- I probably shouldn't.
- I don't care.
- But you asked - Enough, O'Hara.
Goodbye.
We have a problem.
The show's fallen behind.
And the network says the only way we can stay on schedule is if we do the show on friday, live.
Which means we need a script tonight!
- Is that possible?
- Are you kidding me?
- I've never been more inspired in my life.
- Sweet!
Here's the catch.
Now that you've had me cheat on Corrine, I need you to put out new pages, with a new murder weapon, and a scene where Corrine comes after me.
That's a terrible pitch.
Why would I do that?
Because, Lance, the murderer's going to try and finish the job.
Whoever it is has access to the scripts and will be paying very close attention to the murder weapon and will likely tamper with it tomorrow.
But I'll be there to catch them.
All right, Spencer, I trust you're confident this elaborate charade is going to be fruitful for the case?
Confidence is not my problem.
Dry lips, however Pearl, make it nice for the kissers.
Mr. Spencer, we're ready for you on set.
We're moments away from going live.
Okay, so what's our plan?
Well, Lance wrote this long monologue for Corrine after my exit.
That gives me plenty of time to make my costume change, so I'll meet you backstage then.
- Keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious.
- Got it.
We're seconds away from live!
Places, everybody, places!
In four three two and go!
I didn't write that.
- Improvisation.
I like it.
- Yes.
Oh, this can't be good.
Dude, did anyone come near the prop table?
What prop table?
I've been glued to the tv, watching for anything suspicious to happen, like you said.
Dude, you're just standing there eating a meat ball, watching the show.
You're supposed to be watching the prop table!
You never said anything about a prop table, Shawn.
If you would a said watch the prop table, I would have been watching the prop table.
Whoever tampered with that nail gun is our killer, Gus.
- We're talking about my life here!
- I know, Shawn.
This woman is crazy.
- She's gonna kill you.
- Look, forget it, okay?
Just forget it.
I'll check the nail gun myself.
Do me a favor, and save me one of those meat balls, yeah?
Let's go.
You gotta get out there.
This is no time for pranks, Roger.
There's still half a scene before I make my entrance.
Not anymore.
She's all over the place.
She just skipped ahead three pages.
You're on!
- Gus?
- Be strong, Shawn.
Okay here you go.
But do not point this at me, because es mucho dangerioso.
You say that you know, but seriously.
Be very carefulio.
You could morte me with this thing because it is realio as it gets!
I love the improv.
The passion.
Not an improv!
Shawn is the father of Serena's baby!
Please put that down, woman, it's loaded with real nails!
Shawn, watch out!
Watch out!
No!
You are wrong!
I am not a murderer-o!
But I know who is-o.
Yes your twin sister.
Yes, what I mean is, it's someone who wants to be your twin sister.
Someone who wants to be you!
- I definitely did not write this.
- Okay, I don't get it.
No, it's like, eh - My god, he's improvising.
- with homicide I can't do this!
Uh, you make a translation for me, yeah?
Ah, high school spanish comes back to haunt him.
She did it!
Pan over.
Pan over!
After all that, you just point at the murderer?
Don't you have any sense of dramatic tension or build?
Come on, what are we, on blossom?
No!
You start by saying she was your biggest fan.
You know, that she practically worships you.
She read all the scripts.
I got this, I got this you!
Yes, you!
You hated it whenever Corinne was put into Jeopardy.
So you took it up on yourself to avenge her.
I had to.
She cares too much.
Her heart is too big for her chest.
When Ernes to cheated on her, she was too weak to stand up for herself.
I needed to help her.
She was like my best friend.
- I barely spoke to her.
- Really?
So it was you who replaced the retractable prop knife with the real one!
And he deserved it.
And it was also you who poisoned poor Vincente after it was written that he betrayed Corinne.
- But how?
- With a meat ball.
Usually I hunger for her meat balls the way a jackal salivates for an injured possum.
But he wrote a suicide note.
No, he didn't.
You should have a degree in being wrong all the time.
And she almost got away with it!
If it was not for the hairs.
- The hairs?
- Yes, the hairs.
From the cheap imitation wig that you put on to emulate Corinne when you committed these murders!
Yes, I did it!
- And now it's your turn to die.
- Say what?
For sleeping with Serena when all Corinne did was love you.
She's right about that.
Easy, you psycho!
Put it down.
Let go!
Really?
That's what you choose to say?
I only took it for two years in junior high.
Watch out.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Hey.
What the hell is going on here?
Nothing.
My mistake.
Sorry, guys.
That's okay.
See you later, dad.
Okay, Shawn out with it.
We're starting a secret club.
The "burn down the House" club?
The Gus and Shawn club.
It's actually the Shawn and Gus club.
You know, a club needs regulations, by laws.
You guys got any rules?
Yes, no girls.
And everybody has to be under 12.
No old guys.
And they have to have a love of correct grammar.
That's not a rule!
You said we could have one special rule, that's mine.
And that's the best rule you could think of?
I think you mean that's the best rule of which you could think.
I'm not being in a club with this.
Fine, I don't need you and your mis placed prepositions.
Wanna be in a club?
Dude, I feel like the weight of the world is off my shoulders.
One phone call, and my mountain man trip with my dad is off.
Why'd he back out?
He was sick.
He sounded horrible.
He was lurching, he was coughing.
He even sounded pale.
- How do you sound pale?
- I don't know.
Maybe he didn't sound pale, but he definitely sounded feverish.
Maybe he's driving himself to the hospital.
You know what this means.
What we gotta go.
There's no time to discuss.
Oh, Gus - Pay.
- Shawn.
I still don't see why you're so up tight.
thrilled your dad bailed on you.
That's when I thought he was dying.
Dude, do you realize where we are right now?
That's the Monarch Lodge.
Your dad's a member?
Are you kidding me?
We're going in.
Shawn.
You can't just walk into the Monarch Lodge.
They're a clandestine society.
They have a secret Handshake.
Fold it, fold it, skim it.
Crouching Tiger, Zookeeper's boy, hairdresser on fire, girlfriend in a coma.
Slap it on a biscuit.
You might not want to do that.
Dr Guster just insemin a Ted an appaloosa.
- All the way up to the elbow.
- No time to wash up.
Thank you.
You're a good man.
I've always wanted to see the inside of this place.
Oscar Landon Clark.
He started the Santa Barbara mirror.
Dude Moby's a Monarch.
That's not Moby, Shawn.
Martin A. Turner.
The city's first post master.
Can you believe this?
I'm Pretty sure that's Chuck from the wonder years.
Dude.
Oh, my god.
- That is really disturbing.
- Jeez, what are you doing?
Come on, Ted, dragging me all the way over here for this!
Dad, you owe me an explanation What the hell are you into?
You need to call the police.
We did.
A Policeman and a brother.
Ted, I'm retired from both.
SBPD.
Here, I'll dial for you.
Let's go.
This is unbelievable.
Practically every doctor in the city is a member here.
- Do you realize what this means?
- Yes, it means my dad, Mr. Integrity, is nothing more than a lying liar from Liarsburg.
That's Dr Downs.
He has a Huge practice on the Mesa, and he just dumped his rep.
I've been trying to get in there for years.
I'll be right back.
Don't step on the corpse head.
How'd you get in here?
I think I should ask you the same thing.
Sick faker!
Let me feel your fore head.
What are you doing, following me around?
I don't have time for this, Shawn.
Take a look, there's a dead body in the room.
Yes, Mr Arthur Holmstrom.
He was murdered.
Three creams, four sugars.
- Thank you.
- And here's this.
- What's this?
- Yours didn't cost anything.
Dropped my name?
No, coffee club.
Buy 15 coffees, you get one free.
You should get one.
Gee, I don't know.
I mean, what am I gonna do witch over the cash.
- let me give you a little lesson, O'Hara.
- We have 1144.
Deceased male, 1385 Granada place.
Detectives Lassiter and O'Hara en route.
You know that's littering.
- Back up, what do you mean "murdered"?
- Maybe poisoned.
I'm not sure yet.
Shawn, this is not the place for one of your reckless assumptions.
Dad, take a look around.
These guys Hardly seem broken up by this.
I've known Arthur Holmstrom since the day he joined this Lodge.
He was not the most likable guy.
Fine.
Whatever.
I have more important issues to deal with.
I want the truth.
What really happened to my cat, Chairman meow?
- You want answers?
- I want the truth.
You can't handle the truth!
You drive mea little crazy, Shawn.
The idea of spendingan entire weekend with you.
- I drive you crazy?
- Yeah.
And your cat?
Got a little too familiar with the armrest of my sofa.
There.
Henry, I am really sorry for pulling you in on such short notice.
It's just we were allreally nervous about this.
I mean, what if we did something wrong?
He had that hood on for 20 minutes.
- What if he suffocated?
- Ted, calm down.
It's a cloth hood.
You've performed this ceremony, what, a dozen times?
I know, I know.
It's just that we want to make sure it's handled right.
You talked to the police, right?
Yes, yes.
Thank you, thank you.
Say, is this your son?
You know how we love a legacy around here.
No, no, no.
No, yes, he is my son, technically, but I Ted, I'm getting.
No, no, you don't.
Not here, Shawn.
This is not the time for your she Nanigans.
It was a Single she Nanigan.
Technically more of a Hijink.
Pet killer!
I'm not a Pet killer, Shawn.
Chairman Meow is living very happily in a retirement homein Ojai.
And I don't want to burst your bubble, but Chairman Meowis Chairwoman Meow.
Spencer.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What the hell are you doing here?
Lassie, as it happens, my father is a member here.
That's impossible.
Benevolent lodge rule AB-4567 bars any law enforcement member from being a member.
Yeah, and that rule is bogus.
We made that up to keep out undesirables.
"Undesirables"?
People who aren't Lodge material.
Or anyone who's been married to my daughter.
And you are?
This is Irving Parker.
He's my father in law.
Excuse me.
Soon to be former father-in-law.
Not so fast.
Victoria and I have had several civil conversations lately.
Give it up, Carlton!
It was a lost cause two years ago, and it's a lost cause now.
Get over it.
She has.
Move on!
I think we'll all be better off for it.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Are you sure you want to be on this case?
You have a personal involvement here.
That's right, O'Hara, this is personal.
And if it does turn out to be something, that's exactly why I need to be on it.
But these people have something against you.
- They won't anymore after I solve it.
- Carlton look, you don't understand, O'Hara.
I need to be the hero.
I need to solve this case quickly, and look brilliant in the process, and you need to help me do that.
Please.
It's been a pleasure talking with you, dr.
Downs.
Well, you make quite an impression, mr.
Guster.
And under the circumstances, that's saying something.
Well, thank you very much.
And once again, I want to express my sincere condolences.
Perhaps you could give my office a call, and we could set a side some time.
How about monday?
Terrific.
Great.
We're done here.
Gus.
Thanks.
And another thing, dad.
Just when, exactly, were you a member here?
It was a long time ago, Shawn.
I'm not a part of this place anymore.
And whe ther or not this was murder, you are here by ordered to steer clear.
These guys are not to be messed with.
I cannot possibly be more serious about this.
Tuesday at 11:00 is perfect.
I'll be there with bells on.
Okay.
Dude, who says that?
Closers.
Closers say that.
Well, if by closers you mean middle-aged women, then, yes, I do believeI've heard the phrase.
Are you for getting that we many have stumbled up on a murder today?
A murder that you're taking entirely too unseriously?
The man's name was Arthur Holmstrom, and he died during the sacred star ceremony.
Get over here, look at this.
It's weird.
Weird?
Those guys look down right evil.
White men in hoods?
- Dude, they're violet.
- That's how it starts, Shawn.
Do you see that?
Holy crap, Shawn.
Your dad was right.
It's one of those scary Lodge guys.
They're here for us.
They know you think they killed that guy.
Lassie.
What are you doing here?
I think you know why I'm here.
Hope fully you're here to help.
Gus and I were about to do some scrap booking.
We'll need someone who can work the scalloped scissors.
Spencer, I get why you have to act like an ass at my station, but do you have to act like this in your own office?
It enhances my perception.
How else would I know that you came here because you think Arthur Holmstrom was murdered?
No one's talking down at the lodge.
I was just driving by the office and saw the lights on.
You want to hire us.
Come on, Lassie, it's not that tough.
Let it go.
- Lass, come on.
- Look around, you're in a safe place.
Surrounded by men who love you.
Gus.
Lassiter, I love you.
Look you have a connection in there.
So I need you to feel around and see what you can find out.
The department's hiring us?
Not the department, me.
And I can't pay you.
Well, that sounds worth while.
I guess this would technically be called a favor.
Maybe I could pay your expenses.
Done!
When we're finished, we all go for a picnic.
This is a discreet investigation.
I'd like to show you something.
See this?
It's the Lodge radar.
And look at this.
It's me flying under neath it.
Now look down here.
It's gus.
He can't fly.
It is imperative that you keep a low profile.
Place the Robeon our new brother.
That's it?
I'm official?
No brimstone?
I don't have to crab walk or get tickled with a feather?
Come on, somebody, tickle me with a feather, you.
Gentlemen, to the bar.
Yes.
Save me a shot.
Don't you think it's odd that it's just businessas usual when someone died here the other day?
Definitely.
It appears as though he's been all but forgotten.
Look.
Holmstrom's already been moved.
Those paintings are in order of rank.
Once the high most Patriarch moves on, he's replaced by the next guy in line.
- That's Irving Parker.
- Right.
Holmstrom was fifth in line.
Some how he leap frogged three other guys, in Cluding Parker and two of your Doctor Buddies.
grand for "clothing for kids"?
These guys are ultra-philanthropists.
They're the most charitable organization in the city.
Why would they commit murder?
Well, maybe it was for the kids.
"The shroud of Charlemagne".
Dude, Holmstrom was wearing this hood the day he died.
Check it out, it's 100 years old.
Like a lot of the guys around this place.
Sorry.
- What?
- Nothing.
Thank you.
Shawn.
You know my newest clients, Dr. Masood Nigam, and Dr. Roger Downs.
Yes, yes, I do.
Congratulation son your client ship.
Just, you're in good hands with gus.
Nimble, agile hands.
Surgeon's hands, really.
He once removed a boil from his own thigh using a paper clip and a warm can of sprite.
Dude, when did you have time to make all these sales?
We were in there for an hour.
An hour is all you need, Shawn, when you've got sales reptitude.
Dr. Mccormerly, can I talk to you for a second?
You're calling me a day after our first date?
You really are out of practice.
So what'd you find out?
Well, it appears our victim made top dog with very little effort.
One day he was fifth in line for the job, the next day he was high most Patriarch.
And the next day he was dead.
Does anyone suspect you?
No.
Members are beyond suspicion.
Members?
Sweet justice!
They made you a member?
Now, don't get all mad, Lassie.
There was a 15-minute waiting period.
I finally learned the lyrics to informer while they convened and agreed on me.
Let me give you my card, dr.
Mccormerly, 'cause you do not want to miss out on this baby.
Are you staking me out?
No.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
I can sense you're right around the corner.
Whoa, you're breaking up.
Can you call me back, Lassie?
I don't have time for this.
I've got another call.
O'Hara, finally.
Where are you?
I'm at lunch.
Get me a Turkey and Avocado.
- Let me talk to her.
- Hands off!
- Is someone there with you?
- Hi, Jules.
- Spencer.
- You're having lunch with Shawn?
- Maybe.
- Is something going on?
Look, do you have the toxicology reports on Holmstrom or not?
Yeah, but they're inconclusive.
Well, - actually, they're just strange.
- Strange how?
Oh, come on.
Well, it doesn't look like natural causes, and his blood had trace elements of I don't even want to say.
Come on, O'Hara.
Well, it had what looks like the toxin similar to the Venom of a Brazilian vine snake.
You've gotta be kidding me.
- He got bit by a snake?
- Am I on speaker phone?
No.
- Well, then, how did he hear.
- Jules, how bout you just tell us?
He didn't have a Mark on him.
There weren't any puncture wounds.
The only thing he had was a little skin irritation on his face.
Obviously these results are inconclusive, so run the tests again because we need results that aren't ridiculous.
I don't know, Lassie, I kind a like this snake idea.
Why are you sharing information with Shawn on a case we haven't hired him for?
You know what, O'Hara, You, breaking.
I call you back.
Nice.
You Joined the Lodge?
What can I do, dad?
I'm a legacy.
It's in our blood.
Damn it, Shawn, I'm not kidding.
You've gott are consider this.
You get a lot of powerful people in to one room, and dangerous things happen.
Would you please let the Police just do their job?
- I am working for the Police.
- Sort of.
It's a discreet investigation.
- Yeah discreet, that's one of your talents.
- I'm working on a theory.
Arthur Holmstrom was poisoned with snake venom.
- Snake Venom.
- The Brazilian vine Snake.
Specific to remote river basins in nor thern Brazil.
About two to three feet in length.
So someone snuck a three-foot snake in to the Lodge and killed him during the ceremony?
- The perfect crime.
- Right.
Except there were no marks left on the body.
So we're looking for an invisible snake.
You know, Shawn, that's it.
Right- right there.
That is your problem.
Maybe you'd be better off looking for something that you can see.
There is a pecking, order, right in front of your eyes.
Dad, you're gonna ruin my diagram!
Yep, who's at the top?
Who's the next guy in line?
I know where the top is, you could have just pointed.
Now there's coke all over everything.
Forget it.
Just grow up.
Me grow up.
A grown man makes a crawly snake.
This is Parker's place.
I can see the sign, Shawn.
Well, I bet they're very busy inside.
Might I suggest coming back this evening and breaking in?
Good idea.
Let me see what I'm doing for the next three to five years, with time off or good behavior.
We're here now.
I can get us in.
All of a sudden you can just "get us in"?
Shawn, I'm totally in a sales zone this week.
You leave this secret hand shake to me.
I'm not showing an appointment, mister Guster.
Burton Guster.
And this is my associate William Zane.
I'm an old friend, and I'm just paying Mr. Parker a birthday visit.
It's not his birthday.
I know, it's mine.
We're here on Lodge business.
That's a three right there.
What?
Nothing better to do on your birthday?
Well, it's my 29th, not one of the important ones.
You'll understand when you get to be my age.
- I'll only be a minute.
- I'll just let him know that you're here.
No, no need, Doris.
It's my birthday.
Surprise!
You still need a seven right there.
Billy?
It's your birthday?
That's your sales reptitude?
- It comes in all flavors, Shawn.
- Is suck a flavor?
Dude!
The world's very first crock-pot.
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Mr. Parker, it's me, Shawn Spencer.
- I'm the newest monarch, remember?
- Yeah, I remember.
So what the hell are you guys doing wandering around my warehouse?
This is my very good friend Gus.
He's looking to join the monarch Lodge too.
I thought maybe you could make that happen.
You know, haze him a little bit.
Soak his hand in warm water while he's sleeping, that sort of thing.
- Do you have any sheep here?
- This is not a Lodge.
This is my place of business.
And the fact that you slid into member ship on the coat tails of your turn coat dad, that doesn't guarantee any favors from me.
Now I'm through talking to you nicely.
I want you to turn around and get the hell out of here.
Right now!
- I'm surprised he didn't say "good day".
- What's that?
I said good day.
Dude, did you see those shipping crates?
"CCI", "AIF", "XAP".
Those are airport codes, all brazilian.
Brazilian airport codes?
How do you know that?
- I lived in an airport for a month, Gus.
- That was Tom Hanks in the terminal.
Same difference.
We need to talk to Lassiter.
No, you need to talk to Lassiter.
I'll drop you off.
- Where are you going?
- I have appointments with four new clients.
And product doesn't sell itself.
Man Lassie.
Anything?
Well, I've got good news, and I've got bad news.
The good news is we found a pretty solid suspect on the Holmstrom murder.
Finally.
Well, who is it?
Let's go get him.
- That's the bad news.
- That is ridiculous!
Who's in charge here, huh?
I'll tell you this, I better be home for dinner!
Heads are gonna roll, that's all I got to say!
Heads are gonna roll!
Oh, no.
Do not go down that road.
Look, I'm not happy about this either, Lassie.
Now that I've joined the Lodge, that makes your father-in-lawmy brother.
Which makes me your uncle in-law.
It's gonna get especially awkward around the holidays.
Spencer, you can't seriously suspect Parker.
Unfortunately, it sort of checks out.
If it was Venom that killed Holmstrom, it came from a snake that only slithers in a region where Parker does half his business.
He's in room "A.
"Who's going to question him?
I will.
Carlton, do you really think this is a good idea?
You're related.
- It's against department policy.
- O'Hara, quiet.
I'm gonna handle it.
Don't you dare tell the chief.
I can't believe this is happening.
Lassiter's desk.
It's your wife.
I mean your ex-wife.
Hey!
Yeah, well, it seems that Irving is kind of a, well, he's a murder suspect.
Yes.
No, this is not because I want the barbecue.
I already gave you the golf clubs.
- So how'd he go?
- Not quietly.
You ever meet his wife?
No, and if she's anything like her dad, I don't want to.
Okey Doke.
That seems fair.
O'Hara, please go down to the room.
I'll be down in a minute.
Spencer, I want you to listen to me, and listen closely.
I know Irving Parker very well, and he wouldn't kill anyone.
Sure, he might hobble their spirit and crush their soul and dance in the flaming ashes of their broken marriage, which he had a part in ending.
But he wouldn't kill anyone.
Look he's the only suspect we have.
He tried to hate me to death.
I know it's circumstantial, but in a pretty bad way.
I know, and I'm going to go treat him just as I would any other suspect.
But I think Holmstrom's murderer is still out there.
Just just workshop it.
Do what ever it is you do, because at the end of the day, it absolutely cannot be him.
"Workshop it"?
Four, five, six, seven, eight.
I don't know if reverse engineering the case was such a good idea.
"Did its" won 12-zip.
But Lassiter said he was sure that Parker's not our guy.
Well, the board seems to disagree vehemently.
Fine, then let's move away from him, and check out the other Lodge members.
- What do we know about Holmstrom?
- Holmstrom.
We know he's dead.
That's a good start.
I'm serious, Shawn.
I was in that lodge making contacts.
I know.
You have sales reptitude.
Now can we please retire that expression?
Throw it a party, put it on medicare, it's just not working anymore.
No, Shawn, what I'm saying is those other Lodge members were hardly over whelmed with grief.
Even as Holmstrom lay on the floor, I was shamelessly moving my product, and no one see med to think anything of it.
- I'd say Holmstrom had some enemies.
- Well, we gotta figure out who they are.
And how do we do that?
There's something much more important we have to do first.
Tobias, I've heard the canvas adds ten pounds.
Is that accurate?
Maybe you could paint some Angry Tigers or a Puma laying prostrateat my feet.
This is a portrait of your head.
I thought we were here to find something about Holmstrom.
We are.
This is for posterity.
- Don't worry, you're next.
- He doesn't get one.
He's not a member yet.
Maybe we could paint him in the background of mine.
Put his head in the Puma's mouth.
You're going to ignore that.
Hey, why did they take Arthur Holmstrom's painting down so quickly?
All of his things were taken over to his house.
Do it lightly.
Say what you will about credit cards and paper clips, sometimes a door just needs to be owned.
- That's a screwdriver, Shawn.
- Screwdrivers too.
I think it was unlocked.
- It was not unlocked.
- I think it was.
The door was most definitely not unlocked.
Gus, the man was a widower, nobody's here.
Why don't you let me use my new contacts to get the information?
Is that how we do things, Gus, really?
Why talk to someone about Holmstrom when we could have his home office tell us everything we need to know?
His hopes, his dreams - his love for the ladies.
- I think that's his wife.
People lie, stuff doesn't.
- Did you lock the front door?
- Yes, I locked the door.
I don't think it was locked.
I know I lock You see that?
They had to break a window.
Burn!
No.
I just tried that.
Well, I did it in a different spot, Shawn!
He's coming, he's coming, coming, coming!
Watch out!
People breaking into offices no one respects anything anymore.
My god, did you see who that was?
It's hard to see anything with someone's knee in your eye.
It's your own knee.
Get out of here!
Look at this place.
Whoever was here wasn't invited either.
A secret safe.
- Dude, you gotta get us in there.
- I can't get us in that safe, Shawn.
That's a Martin 16.
You're 36 months into a subscription to modern safecracker magazine what's the point?
I'm an amateur, Shawn.
- Well, it's timet o go pro, fingers.
- Fingers?
Twist it up.
Watch out.
Would you stop it!
Now I've gotta start all over.
This month would be good.
- It's not happening, Shawn.
- Try 36-24-36.
- Are you serious?
- Just click it in gentle.
That was a good idea.
Now what?
I really thought I nailed that.
Shawn, you've really gotta work on your estimating skills.
Dude.
You're a safecracking machine!
- I know.
- Grab that.
All right, I've got $25,000 for komputers for kids.
This one says 35,000.
One of these books is a fraud.
Dude, Holmstrom was skimming funds from the Lodge.
And look, he's writing in some secret, ancient code.
No, this isn't code, they're abbreviations.
"HX" means history, "QD" means every day, "C" means and.
Deposit history, follow up with accounts every day, transfer and with drawals.
- You're telling me you can read this?
- Of course I can.
This is doctor's Shorthand.
And this is doctor's handwriting.
See these sticky notes?
Holmstrom wrote these.
He wasn't skimming, he figured out who was.
One of the doctors is cooking the books.
- How sure are you?
- 85, 86%.
We've gone on much less.
Look, Irving, it's been four hours.
Is that all?
You know, Carlton, it may be the rage talking, but if I had it to do over again, the day my tory came home with you, I would have told her to go right back out that door and come back alone.
- That's what I should have done.
- All right, Irving, that's enough!
Now, I loved Victoria, and because she loved you, I let it slide that you're a pain in the ass.
But you're at my table now, and around here, we call someone like you a hostile witness.
It's a good way to get yourself locked up.
I can make your life a living hell, so you better give me the respect I deserve.
And I suggest you cut the crap.
Clear?
I want a straight answer, and I want it immediately.
How did Arthur Holmstrom advance to the highmost Patriarch when you were the next in line?
Well, I don't know how Art convinced the other guys.
He asked me, and I said it was okay.
He was a friend of mine, and he had health problems.
He was getting worse.
And I gave him the only chance he'd probably ever get.
Now, as for the snake business, I haven't traveled abroad in over three years.
I haven't been out of the country since you got married.
Doctor's orders.
Are we done?
We're done when I say we're done!
We're done.
You can go.
We've been to four doctors' offices.
None of the hand writing matches the books.
Plus, I probably caught something from somebody, and I'm tired of reading high lights for children.
They always hide the apple in the bike.
Can you man up, Shawn?
Is that possible?
I'm on an unbelievable hot streak right now, and I'm not about to ruin it.
It's good to know that moving oozing infection gel is more important than finding a killer.
Hey, maybe we could park on a steeper incline next time.
My quads aren't burning enough.
Tell Heather to call back tomorrow.
Yes?
Good afternoon.
I'm Burton Guster, with central coast pharmaceuticals.
We're closed.
Yes, well, I'm here to drop off some product to Dr. Downs.
He's a brother of mine.
- He isn't here at - Well, he was expecting me.
You can leave your card.
I just thought I'd drop by and pay him a birthday visit.
It's my birthday, the big two-nine.
Remember that one?
I'm 26.
Really?
So will Dr. Downs be here later?
I will make sure he gets this.
And look, he's writing in some secret, ancient code.
Dude!
I just solved it.
Call Lassie.
O'Hara.
Right.
To absent friends.
To absent friends.
Absent friends?
Like Arthur Holmstrom?
What?
My sweet violet brothers, we congregate here today in the flesh, not only to recognize our new highmost Patriarch, Irv Parker, but also to bear witness.
Along with the magic head of Gus, the wisdom of baum and that that stuffed creature.
Arthur Holmstrom was murdered.
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck goose!
Dr. Roger Downs, entrusted with the proceeds of charity activities, was funneling funds into his own pocket and covering his tracks by using a dummy accounting ledger.
Now, when Holmstrom discovered the corruption, he confronted downs and made a play for the highmost Patriarch position.
In exchange for his silence, Holmstrom got what he wanted.
But downs still couldn't chance getting caught.
And so he killed his own Lodge brother right here on the eye of Hathor in the middle of the Lodge.
And this is the murder weapon.
How dare you accuse me?
I am a respected officer of this Lodge.
By the shores of gitchagoomee, I can see you in the house, frantically searching for the ledgers that Holmstrom kept securely stored in his safe, Ironically, to keep you good to your word.
Arthur Holmstrom's death was, unfortunate, but I had nothing to do with it.
Check it out, Lassie.
I'm quite certain you'll find traces of a powdered form of the venom of the Brazilian vine snake, native to Brazil.
It's part of an antivenom that Dr. Downs uses in his charitable work abroad.
Who knew that in small doses it acts as a vaccine, while larger doses are absolutely lethal?
I did - Really?
- This is absurd!
Holmstrom died of natural causes.
By the halls of Montezuma, I see you taking great care to put on protective gloves while lining the inside of the hood with the powder for Holmstrom's Patriarch ceremony, making it deadly venomous.
The poor old man's head and face never stood a chance.
Not too keen on the hippocratic oath, are we, Rog?
I have nothing to say.
Speak to my lawyer.
Hold it right there, Dr. Downs.
You're under arrest.
And none of this, your highmost, would have been discovered with out the intrepid Police work of one detective Carlton Lassiter, Santa Barbara Police department's own highmost Patriarch.
Nice collar, detective.
It's all in a day's work, Irving.
You may not be my son-in-law much longer, but I'm thinking you might be a monarch yet.
Hey!
You ready to go?
- What could you possibly mean by that?
- Our big weekend, remember?
I cancelled, I felt bad.
So I just thought we'd go this weekend.
Dad, I wish you'd given me a little bit of advance notice.
I'm I'm swamped here.
Yeah, right.
All right, look, I'm gonna go.
You want to come along, you're welcome.
Whoa, dad, wait a second.
There's still something that doesn't make any sense to me.
- Why did you leave the Lodge?
- Look, Shawn, it's not important, let it go.
Come on, you big liar.
Throw a little truth on the Barbie, see if it stinks.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about man candor.
Let's have some.
All right, all right, you want some man candor.
You want the truth?
My marriage was falling apart, and I made a choice.
A stopped caring about the Lodge, because I realized the only real member ship that mattered was family.
There.
Family?
You really expect me to believe that?
What the hell is that?
This you gotta see.
Nice addition, don't you think?
- We grabbed 'em on our way out of the Lodge.
- Way out?
Yeah, Gus and I decided we didn't want to belong to a club that would have Lassiter as a member.
You can have yours if you want it.
Nah.
No, I think it should stay right where it is.
That way I can always keep an eye on you.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Shawn, where's that nice new sweater vest your mom just put on you for picture day?
Yeah, that.
It wasn't working for us.
We chose the knight rider shirt instead.
Mom loves KITT.
Do you know how a cop distinguishes when somebody's lying?
When it sounds like that.
Go upstairs, put the vest back on.
Pictures last forever, Shawn.
I want you to look your best.
There's a body in a service elevator?
No bodies.
- A dogfighting ring?
A missing snowman?
- No.
Yes, a snowman is missing, but we're not on that case.
Relax.
- I am not working.
- I know you aren't.
I do not work on my birthday.
I think you've made your position clear on that.
- Then tell me where we're going.
- That's not how a surprise works.
Happy birthday, dude.
Welcome to the fall line launch party for Ciao clothing.
Gorgeous models, fake celebrities.
No food, though.
This is the most exclusive event of the year.
What's the Rub?
I think you're in the wrong line there, gentlemen.
- I think we're on the VIP list.
- Names?
Black and Tan.
- First names?
- No first names.
One of us is Black, and one of us is Tan.
- We're a modeling team.
- Perhaps you've heard of us.
Let's just go.
We're retired.
Just check your list.
Holy crap, it is here.
Sorry for the mix-up, Tan.
I beg your pardon?
My name is Black.
His name is Tan.
I can't believe you just made that assumption.
You should be ashamed of yourself and your family.
Okay, how did you pull that off?
Well, Ciao's number was in the phone book.
I don't ever want to hear again that my filipino accent doesn't work magic.
This is one of the most thoughtful presents anyone's ever given me.
Man, that's Berlinda Desidovicz!
The waitress?
She's not a waitress, she's the model.
The one from the Floppy cakes ad.
The third girl on the left on that billboard I always point out.
- You know her name?
- Her name?
I know her life story.
She has a fan club.
Well, she's putting one together.
I'm number one on the interest list.
She's one of the most popular models in the entire Santa Barbara downtown area, Shawn.
I've been in love with her since the icy pops ad.
- She's the one that says "gooey".
- Yes, she's the "gooey" girl.
This is Huge for you, man.
I'll hook it up.
I can take care of this myself.
What you think?
Should I pull out the Cheetah?
The Cheetah is the worst name for a pickup move in the history of mankind.
Remember the rule: treat a woman like a person, then a Princess, then a greek goddess, then a person again.
Besides, I think operation: Colonel Sugarlemons is a much better move for a place like this.
Cool.
Good luck.
Emily!
Ladies and gentlemen, our Chairman and Founder, Gregor Uwe Steeb.
Ciao!
Ciao!
Do not worry.
I will, raise this myself.
I'm only the head of the company, and after doing all the design work myself, I was looking forward to some menial work.
Gregor!
Oh my god!
Gregor!
Gregor!
You absolutely sure you don't want to work tonight?
You expect us to believe that you model?
What, that's hard to believe?
What, me and my bro here aren't worthy of leering into a little camera lens or blue-steeling it up occasionally?
Your bro, of course.
His features are immaculate.
But you not so much.
What?
What are you, insane?
Help, help me out here, Tan.
- He's a foot model.
- Well, that makes sense.
Really, thanks for that.
He's lying.
It was foot and ankle.
And I did some hand work, okay?
Perhaps you recognize this from the insurance commercials.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Want to come?
- Okay.
- Ciao.
She seems so bored.
So lonely.
Yeah, but so does everybody here, dude.
Did you notice that the mike stand was set too low when Gregor came out on the stage?
Why would the mike stand be set so low when he's the only one who was gonna speak tonight?
- Do you see the clock?
- But what if we stumble upon something huge?
What does the clock say, Shawn?
- Fine.
- Thank.
Never mind.
It's your birthday.
No work, got it.
All right, you will each, one by one, go to the area I've sequestered, state the name of the agency you work for and.
Why am I surprised?
Usually it's because just tell me if you've seen anything.
Maybe.
Do you suspect foul play?
Not really.
There's no one here with an IQ over 40.
So you're asking for our help.
Never mind.
We're not available tonight.
Wide open tomorrow, though.
What is this about, Shawn?
Look, my dad insisted I return these by 8:00 A. M. I don't know about you, I plan on sleeping in till at least noon.
- Especially after we howl all night.
- Whoa.
I think somebody's in there.
No, that can't be.
Dude, it's 10:43.
He's easily been asleep for two hours.
No, I think it's a woman.
Listen.
See there is someone here.
Mr. Spencer.
How unexpected.
Chief?
I just came by to leave these half boots on the door mat.
I didn't see anything.
Mr Spencer, please come in.
Come in.
Mr Guster.
I just thought I'd bring my dear friend Susan over to meet your father.
She's a lovely, single woman who works at city hall.
Excuse me.
O'Hara, this better be big.
You're still at Ciao?
The electrical cabling's been tampered with?
Okay.
Well, this case just changed.
- Dude - I will kill you, Shawn.
All right, get any potentials down to the station.
I am on my way.
You be okay?
Okay.
Bye.
Bye, Henry.
Thank you.
- What are you doing here?
- Well, we didn't realize it was ladies night at club Henry.
So I dropped by to return your half boots.
Wow, Henry, that's some wild-looking footwear.
Yeah - Susan, this is my son Shawn and, Gus.
- Nice to meet you.
You can call me Sue.
Most people call me Sue B. Because there are two Sues at the office.
But obviously that's not really a factor here.
Shawn, could you help me in the kitchen with these?
Thank you.
We'll be right back.
So heard about Pluto?
That's messed up.
Yeah.
Really, dad?
Cheese cubes and wieners?
What's happening here?
Is this some sort of blind date?
Sort of.
I don't know.
She's just what do you call it?
Nondescript.
"Nondescript"?
I've never heard a woman described like that unless she was a robbery suspect.
I just don't know.
I mean, she's pretty.
She's a little boring and prim.
I cubed these myself.
She didn't even try one.
What do you think?
What's your opinion?
I have no opinion of any kind whats oever.
Shawn, come on.
You have an opinion on everything.
Especially when it comes to women.
- Just give me your first impression.
- No.
Why not?
You have to get over this.
Nobody wants to grow old alone.
Maybe a nice lady will help him relax a little.
New subject, Gus.
Did you see the chief run out of there?
Must be something big.
You know, I was thinking, there's only 73 minutes left in your birthday.
- Actually, 72 minutes.
- Not until midnight, Shawn.
I'm Cinderella, and this is my ball.
And I'm not lifting a finger until my carriage turns into a big-ass pumpkin.
- Got it?
Good.
- Got it.
Thank you.
Okay, where do you want all these people?
Just put 'em in both interrogation rooms and we'll rove it.
Let's go, go, go!
So the electrical cable offstage was deliberately severed.
The chief thinks it was done pro.
That means You don't remember where you were this afternoon?
It was yellow.
And boring.
Are we talking about a restaurant?
I don't know, maybe.
Just write down that it was lame.
I do like that jacket.
Really?
Somewhere a transient is shivering in the night.
Detective.
Fine, tell me what you got.
How's it going, crime fighters?
They're not very forthcoming or bright.
One of them cannot confirm the correct spelling of his own name.
Did you by chance interview a model named Berlinda?
Is she still around?
Gus, we don't have time for this.
I know, and that's why I'm here to offer our services.
I'd rather shower with a bear.
Look, they're only gonna talk to their own kind.
Okay?
Shallow, judgmental, cruel, and Gorgeous.
We're already embedded.
What do you mean "embedded"?
Chief, we may or may not have used deception to get into the party tonight.
See you at swimwear wednesday.
- Don't let 'em scare you, Tan.
- He's Tan.
- They think we're models.
- They think I'm a model.
- Me too.
- A foot model.
And ankle, Gus!
Dude, that's just ridiculous anyway.
Everybody look at my jaw.
Well, I've seen enough.
You're hired.
What?
Hired.
You can look the word up.
Change that tie, detective.
Now, Mr Spencer, if you have a moment, I'd like to see you privately.
Of course, Chief.
Ciaobella and Gregor are home grown celebrities.
The local media is sharpening its pencils on this one.
And that is not the kind of press that this department or its interim chief needs.
- Do I make myself clear.
- Clear as a crystal ball.
Good.
So tell me did your father say anything about my friend Susan?
They all live here?
Well, Gregor owns the building.
The Ciao studio's across the street.
He uses this loft for his prime models.
I wonder if it looks like the loft in head over heels.
You, and only you, can confirm that.
My Husband's funeral is tomorrow at 12:25.
Be there no later than And I'll have to approve whatever you're wearing.
Now, obviously, we have no choice but to continue with the fall line unveiling on wednesday.
Ma'am, before we move on, should I hire someone to do Magnolias - tomorrow for the service?
- Well, of course hire someone, Emily!
It's not like they grow on trees.
That marriage always seemed weird to me.
Like when Liza Minnelli married David Gest.
Yeah, well, Ciaobella and Gregor lasted eight years, Gus.
I suspect that some of those marble-chiseled simpletons are more devious than they let on.
We're gonna have to dig deep and blend in in order to get real answers.
Dude, you thought I was gonna have trouble blending in?
I have this shirt, this shirt.
Most of these shirts.
And these are my exact Kenneth Coles.
And that picture of my mom parasailing in Montego bay.
You moved me in?
Dude, we got Lucky.
They just threw some guy out.
Now we can live it up chic while we catch a killer.
- Now help me set up my clapper.
- I'm not moving in here, Shawn.
I don't care how many secrets we uncover.
Shower's free.
I got the window.
You must be Sigrid.
- What is that, Cossack?
- Die.
- You can question her.
- You know who I'm questioning.
What's up, Roomies?
Initiation.
That's what.
Put 'em up.
- I'm allergic to pillows.
- Tommy John, both elbows.
Come on.
Give me your best shot black.
It would really behoove you guys to get our names right in the future.
Good.
Berlinda, you're here.
Look, we are so out of the loop.
You gotta catch us up on everything, you know.
The dead Gregor thing, that awful Ciaobella.
- The agency.
- Maybe we can play truth or dare.
Actually, we were thinking about maybe going to a bar, doing some 02.
Couldn't we do that after we talk?
Because I know I have so many questions.
I could be ready in three minutes.
Shawn!
Dad?
How did you find me?
Shawn, I was a detective for 15 years.
You're not hard to find.
Was that guy wearing a bra?
Could possibly be so important that you're here right now?
It's Karen's friend Susan.
She called again.
Twice in the last two days.
Doesn't that reek of desperation?
No, no, no.
This is not happening.
Shawn, this is ridiculous!
You come to me for advice on one of your stupid cases at least once a week.
I ask for a simple assist on dating protocol, you can't give it to me?
Call me old-fashioned, Shawn.
I haven't been pursued by a woman in 33 years.
- It used to be the other way around, you know.
- Okay, fine, dad, look.
Women your age, they don't have time to play games.
She was wearing a cardigan!
But she saw the inside of your house, and didn't run screaming in horror.
Ride the upside.
Now, I can't talk about this for one more second because I'm proud of the fact that I have never been in therapy, okay?
Shawn, no!
- Hello.
- Dude, what the hell happened to you guys?
Some of the models got creeped out that you hang with your dad all the time.
- What?
- All right, fine!
We were afraid if we hung out with him any longer, we might catch wrinkles.
Just tell me where you're going.
- Shawn, I can't talk now.
- Gus, you're not being helpful.
And we have a case to solve.
Miss Bloom.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
- I'm Black - I know who you are.
You're staying at the loft.
You're the one no one believes used to be a model.
Who's saying these things?
I believe you.
Thank you.
I think your ankles are magnificent.
Well, I play a lot of ping-pong.
Wow, these are really good.
Thank you.
I've never really shown them to anyone before.
Why not?
I'd totally wear these.
- This if I was very confused.
- Yes.
You know, I just let Gregor and Ciaobella do the designs.
It's Ciaobella's company now.
Well, my lunch break is over.
It's after 9:00.
Yeah, I kinda work long hours.
I'm just so far behind, Ciaobella's gonna freak.
I've gotta get back to work.
Will I see you tomorrow at the funeral?
Yes, definitely.
I'm, yeah.
I think so, yeah.
Good.
Don't work too hard.
Hi, you've reached Burton Guster with Central Coast Pharmaceuticals.
Leave me a message and I'll get back to you.
Straight to voice mail?
That's how we're doing it now?
One moderately hot chick comes by, and suddenly I'm invisible?
You know what, Gus?
That's fine.
I'm taking the bunk next to the window.
And don't be surprised if your pillow smells faintly of my butt.
What is this?
Did you guys get up at dawn?
Dude, you couldn't give me a little shake?
We got up five minutes ago.
Sigrid, we can all go together.
I would rather eat my own earlobes than spend another hour with you callous monsters.
That girl's acting like a freak.
Did you accomplish anything last night besides selling me out for vacant head?
Yes, I did.
I found out that Berlinda always wanted a pet dwarf bunny as a child.
And she loves anything that smells and looks like lavender.
Sweet.
Let's call the chief and get paid.
I also found out that Ciaobella was grilling all of the models because she was convinced that one of them was sleeping with Gregor.
- Really?
- Yep.
Well that coupled with the fact that she's drunk with power, treating her sweet little assistant like dirt, give us a pretty good suspect, I'd say.
Let's crash a funeral.
Oh, my god.
Is he wearing Hugo Boss?
What a sellout!
See you never.
Good night forever you bald bastard.
Hold on.
It was me who peed in the hot tub.
Okay You reap what you sow, Uwe Steeb.
Remember that.
You don't even know that dude.
I'm in character, Shawn.
Besides, Berlinda's listening.
Shut up.
You know what, man?
I didn't want to tell you this.
Berlinda's the one that couldn't spell her own name.
So?
You don't know her like I do, Shawn.
- Dude!
- What?
That was a love note.
That's a love note.
That's a love note.
She just hid a love note in the casket.
That means Sigrid was Gregor's mistress.
Ciaobella found out about it and killed him.
I got it!
- You can't dance at a funeral, Shawn.
- All of a sudden you're the arbiter of good taste?
We wait until it's over, and we do it without blowing my cover to Berlinda.
She only dates models.
Fine, I'll call Jules.
Well, thank you all for coming.
We gather today not to mourn the passing of my dead husband Hassenfeffer!
But rather to celebrate all that he once was.
While I will always Miss Gregor Uwe Steeb whose real name was Gregory Lapspanksi I encourage you all not to cry but to drink and laugh and dance as we remember a man who once thought a belt made of dried bits of panther was a good idea.
Good-bye, my love.
Gregor She's really planting one on him?
Miss Masterson?
Ciaobella?
Ciaobella?
I've changed my mind.
It wasn't the wife.
I loved Gregor, and he loved me.
But he wasn't gonna leave his wife, and you never learned to share as a child, so you went ahead and killed them both.
For symmetry.
Sound about right?
No, it wasn't like that.
I mean, sure, it was frustrating.
I couldn't say anything about her without him flying off the handle.
He wouldn't even let me drink out of the same glass as her.
He said that comparing me to her was like comparing Cleopatra to Miss Cleo.
- You think Berlinda's back at the loft?
- That analogy doesn't make any sense.
It would if you knew who either of them were.
But I was sharing.
I accepted it.
A piece of him was enough.
I mean, it was that or nothing.
I miss him so much.
He was the only one that knew how to accentuate my shoulders to make my waist and hips look smaller.
You realize you had more motive - than anyone, Sigrid.
- No.
Now Emily Bloom has taken over sole creative control of Ciao.
I mean, she inherits everything.
Emily Bloom?
- Who?
- The mousy assistant?
She started as an assistant.
That's just how they treated her.
But she's third in line.
Interesting.
She failed to mention that little factoid.
- Is that the same suit - Yes, okay?
It is!
I can get more than one wearing out of a suit in a work week.
- It's the same tie.
- Get out of here!
Don't go getting any ideas about hopping a plane to Trinidad and Tobago.
You're not out of the woods yet, missy.
- What's the plan, Stan?
- Go away.
The reason we brought you in on this case was so that people would stop dying.
O'Hara, get down to Ciao.
I want you to put the clamps on Miss Bloom, our little kiwi ladder climber.
Check.
Then I will pay the penalty to terminate the contract.
William, will you please make sure those pleather samples make it to Alicia Silverstone before 3:00.
Don't even give it another thought.
No, a bunny does not need to go blind in order to confirm that our buyers should not eat our clothing.
How would you like it if I doused your retina in henna, you Cromagnon piece of - I'm detective O'Hara from the - Screw you!
Let's acknowledge the curve, Samantha.
You know, real women, real figures.
Just raise the waist line.
Make it an "A" cut.
And don't think for one second I didn't notice your new bangs.
- You look 21 again.
- Miss Bloom, I need to ask you a few questions.
And we're walking.
We believe that both your predecessors were killed by the same person.
And no one stood to gain more than I did by killing them both?
Well, I'm glad you can see where this is headed.
- I'll need you to account for your whereabouts.
- Now it's just the protype, but I've never wanted to be a woman this badly in my life.
Okay.
Can you try these on?
I don't think that's appropriate.
Wait, excuse me!
What?
..
These are fabulous.
Now, are we talking in your office or mine?
Okay, back to work, everybody.
William, order pizza for everybody.
That yummy place with the soy ricotta.
Thank you.
Well, this is my office, so fire away.
You've been head of this company for six hours, and you've changed just about everything.
You're not exactly preserving the Ciao legacy.
You know, I have all these things I've always wanted to do.
And I'm turning the company green.
I'm ending animal testing.
Subsidizing proceeds to help find a cure for breast cancer.
Do any of those sound like bad things to you?
Unfortunately, that's not an alibi.
No, it isn't.
And what's more, I don't think I have one.
I mean, I was with them all day every day.
I see.
Well, I'm sure you won't mind if I have a look around and chat with a few of your employees?
No, of course not.
That's it, Miss Bloom.
Detective Aren't you forgetting something?
Right.
You know, you have such great lines.
There's no reason why you can't dress to arrest.
Is there?
All right, what do we know about Emily Bloom?
Well, she wrote, are you there, god?
It's me Margaret, and freckle juice.
I think that was Judy Bloom.
- Then I got nothin'.
- Could you possibly be bringing less - to the table right now?
- Shawn, you're just upset because - I'm more than a pair of ankles.
- I don't get it.
Emily Bloom was the vice President of the company, yet she was running coffee and balancing the books?
Dude, are you oiling your head.
Lavender.
Berlinda likes her men to shine.
Chief.
Mr. Spencer, I'm going to ask you a very important question, - and I'd appreciate some candor.
- Shoot.
Has your father lost his mind?
I mean, why hasn't he called my friend Susan back?
- Honestly, he should be so lucky.
- Chief, I cannot get involved in some sort of soap opera starring my father.
- For the record - Hold on.
This is Vick.
He asked me out.
Wonderful!
Oh, my gosh.
What did he say?
- Oh, well, he left a message.
- Oh, yeah, that sounds like Henry.
- Dad?
- Should I take her to crab shack Willie's - or the third wharf?
- Those can't possibly be real places.
- Look, dad, I'm really busy, okay?
- Do not bring your purse into the restaurant.
- Shawn, just pick a restaurant.
- Listen, I'm gonna call him back.
Okay, call me later, honey.
I don't know where you should take her to dinner!
Hold on.
That's her.
Gotta go.
- He called her.
- He called her.
Now stop messing around and go find me a killer.
Good-bye.
- Am I dreaming?
- Nope.
I just look this good.
How is it possible that I am the only sane person - in the universe right now?
- Question do you think this shirt enhances or detracts from my traps?
Berlinda's going to get me into the fashion show.
- Have you worn that before?
- Nope.
This shirt was designed by Gregor Uwe Steeb, Shawn.
It's a part of the new fall line.
I'm only the head of the company, and after doing all the designs myself - These are really good.
- Thank you.
I've never really shown them to anyone before.
That is not Gregor's design.
- What are you talking about?
- They're stealing her designs.
- Whose?
- Emily's.
Gregor said he personally designed the whole new line.
He's full of it.
That's Emily's.
I've seen it.
They're all Emily's.
Would you please put some pants on?
The fish and chips is actually pretty good.
I've been craving meat lately.
Well, in that case the prime rib is excellent.
BYOB.
Help yourself.
- No, no, actually, I don't think it is.
- Is it hot in here?
I don't think so.
It's pretty comfortable.
Whew, that's better.
Don't you think?
- What happened to you?
- I am a woman, chief.
And I am choosing to dress like one.
You can't do that, O'Hara.
I paid for it myself.
I was feeling good about myself, it was my lunch break and Carlton, is that a new tie?
Don't be ridiculous.
- I trust this is all in aid of something?
- Yes, chief.
I spent the entire afternoon at Ciao, and I am certain that Emily Bloom is not our killer.
I grilled her, she didn't break.
Not to mention she has over a dozen employees that would take a bullet for her.
She simply doesn't have it in her to kill somebody, much less two somebodies.
I'd bet the farm on it.
I'm sensing something.
Gregor and Ciaobella were stealing Emily's designs.
Stealing them, passing them off as their own.
All the while treating her as a peon.
That's not a bad start for motive.
Toxicology report: Ciaobella was poisoned.
The only thing in her system were traces of arsenic, soy milk, and green superfood powder.
Bad news, Jules.
I think you just lost the farm.
Would you like me to butter your biscuit?
Excuse me?
So what's it like working for the mayor?
It's okay.
It'd be more fun if he wasn't married though.
So what's it like being retired?
I mean, you're not that old, so what's the story?
You take a slug?
Or did you just get tired of being good all the time?
Now be honest Isn't that better than some flaky piece of fish?
That's good.
- Very good.
- Yeah?
It's good.
Oh, damn it, damn it.
Damn it, I dropped my fork, I I'll just get one myself.
Okay, for the record, I still don't feel right about this.
- Dad, I thought you were supposed to be - Shawn, I was wrong.
She's like this carnivorous mink.
She wants to eat me right here That was weird.
Oh, come on!
So, Shawn, still feel like she's our killer?
Three dead bodies?
- Detectives, go call an ambulance.
- Holy crap!
She's stable now.
They've pumped her stomach.
I have a sample on the way to the lab.
Emily.
Black.
Wh-what are you doing here?
It's a long story that you don't really need to hear.
How do you feel?
Not terrible.
I just I can't remember anything that happened after I finished, my dinner.
Dinner.
What did you have?
Well, the pizza was gone, so I just had a superfood smoothie and some tofurkey jerky.
- Oh, my god.
- What?
I was really hungry, - and I just wanted something quickly.
- No, no, no, I've gotta go solve I'm I-m I'm really glad, though, that you're feeling That you're not, um My name is - How 'bout I come back later?
- Yeah, I'd like that.
Sweet!
Gregor and Ciaobella I'm all over the second and third "hows" with these smoothies.
All the models that would have benefited from killing Gregor and Ciaobella have no reason to kill Emily too, I don't think.
- What's the missing link?
- Right, put a pin in it, and I'll make my move on Berlinda, and we'll pick it up in the morning.
Only a few know that their actual wedding took place in a private ceremony on the small bahamian island of Abaco two years earlier.
Today would have been their tenth wedding anniversary.
Did you know that?
No, Shawn.
I'm not interested in learning new trivia - about our murder victims.
- Ten years is a milestone anniversary in this state, Gus.
Financially, it's a benchmark.
It means all the assets get split right down the middle.
We're not gonna solve this thing tonight, Shawn.
I know part of it.
I might even know 2/3 of it.
Dude, I could totally go up there.
- But you won't.
- All right, Spencer, we did a rush tox screen on Emily.
You were right.
She had the same poison in her system as Ciaobella, - but in a much higher dose.
- I definitely know 2/3 of it!
Stop it, Shawn.
Don't do it.
Don't just get up there and start winging it.
That's not how we operate.
Dude, where have you been for the last two years?
Come on, Shawn.
I'm so close.
- Would you tell us why we're here?
- Never afraid to take risks, Ciobella's dress of electric lights, set the Paris - fashion world ablaze - Oh, my god, this is a doozy.
I mean, wow.
Establishing her as one of the top designers working today.
Stop the projector.
Or or just keep it going.
That's that's fine.
I know this may be hard for some of you to believe, but I'm not really black.
And I'm not a model.
My partner Gus and I are detectives.
You're not a model?
I'm only a detective part-time.
And my full name is Tan Gus.
Ciaobella Masterson was murdered by her husband, Gregor Uwe Steeb.
Wait, wait, wait.
That doesn't make any sense.
Gregor was already dead.
Do I come down to your office and bother you while you're working?
All the time.
That's fair.
Gregor was having an affair.
He couldn't chance getting caught.
Not with his tenth wedding anniversary approaching.
He was desperate to get out of the marriage without losing half of his company.
So he poisoned Ciaobella's green superfood powder.
Only she wouldn't die because she was bulimic.
Ciaobella couldn't keep anything she ate down.
That's why it took forever for the poison to take effect.
All Gregor could do was wait He wouldn't even let me drink out of the same glass as her.
And keep his vampire mistress away from the poisonous elements.
But Ciaobella knew of the affair, and had herself a mind for murder.
Using her own skills with electricity, she laid a trap for Gregor before his plan was complete.
What's up?
!
What about Emily?
Emily was drinking a superfood smoothie the day she took over.
Really, Jules?
- You too?
- I'm sorry.
Is this just a free-for-all?
Anybody can just bounce in anytime they want?
I'm sorry.
In summation, Ciaobella killed Gregor.
Gregor killed Ciaobella.
Emily got caught in the green powdery crossfire.
But not before she designed the new fall line.
It's revolutionary, by the way.
We all deserve to feel beautiful.
What am I supposed to do with these?
Nothing.
Put 'em away.
I guess what I'm saying is you're all free to go.
That was crazy, right?
You could have told me that over the phone.
Hell, you could've put it in an email.
Come on.
Dude, did you see that?
That was, like, the most stylish wrap-up ever.
Except for the part where there was no one to accuse.
But whatever, right?
It was hot.
Gus.
Gus?
All right, here I am.
Why are you dressed like Perry Como?
- Thanks for coming, son.
- You said it was important.
Clearly, you're about to shoot an old spice commercial.
That's funny.
Look, Shawn, I just I need to talk to you.
You know, face to face.
I got it.
You've been invited to a very special screening of bullitt.
I'm going on another date with Susan.
What, the woman you described as a carnivorous mink?
I'll admit her behavior threw me a little off balance, but the night ended up being a lot of fun.
Oh, my god.
You have a hickey!
You called me over here to show off your hickey?
!
- That's sick!
- Shawn, no!
No, I called you over here because I don't want to feel guilty about moving on with my life.
Your mother's not a part of it anymore.
She hasn't been for a long time.
She is not coming back.
And I hope she's happy.
Yeah I mean that.
She deserves it.
But my life is here, Shawn.
And I don't want to have to sneak around trying to live it.
- I can't deal with this right now.
- Well, Shawn, you have to.
Look, I don't care what you do, okay?
I don't care.
I just don't want to hear about it.
So don't call me on the phone asking me for advice.
And don't expect me to meet you and your new dominatrix girlfriend for dinner.
- Kid, this is not easy for me either.
- Yeah, it never was.
Have a nice date.
And unless you plan on taking her to wayne manor, lose the turtleneck, okay?
Let her admire her work.
And remember, you treat a woman like a person, and then a princess, - and then a greek goddess - And then a person again.
Right.
Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Hon, I'm gonna grab a drink.
- Wanna get me one too, sweetie?
- Okay.
Shawn.
What are you doing?
You were supposed to be asleep two hours ago.
I was watching.
And then I know I shouldn't, but then I didn't want to go back upstairs.
I was scared.
All right.
Now listen, now you know that none of this is real, right?
It's all makebelieve.
People do not become bloodthirsty monsters after they get shot.
In fact, I've had a lot of experience in the field with puncture wounds, and there's no way a giant dart to the lungs creates a 6-inch hole visible from the other side.
- Really?
- No way!
I mean, maybe the blood-engorged cavity will become purple and expand and perhaps even explode I've seen that.
Look, dead bodies do not walk, son.
Sometimes they suddenly blink or jolt for a second, but Mostly they just wither and smell snd drizzle and ooze.
All right, now go to bed.
Sleep tight.
A Museum?
and not even the one downtown?
- Hey, the paper come out yet?
- I don't know.
They running another - story on the Wyles death?
- I don't know.
Perhaps.
Gosh, I hadn't even thought about that.
Carlton, you're name's been in every article they've printed since you've reopened the case.
Has it?
I try not to read the papers too much Very skewed.
No, I was just gonna look at the classified ads.
I mean, you know I've been looking - for a new bob's big boy, right?
- I got it, Detective.
Press operator from the mirror gave me an advanced copy.
But there's nothing about you or Wyles in there.
What?
Impossible I leaked that stuff about the will getting changed yesterday.
Hey, did you say you were looking for a big boy, like a full-size?
Go away.
Thing's a rag anyway.
- Security tape, Ms. Bridgewell.
- Hi, I'm Detective O'Hara.
- Sophie.
- Wait, you're the curator?
- Assistant curator.
- I'd like to speak to someone in charge.
- I am in charge.
- She sounds in charge.
- The Mummy room's this way.
Please follow me.
- Where's the curator?
He's in Egypt procuring the rest of this collection, but I assure you There's no need.
He's been working all night.
Can you catch us up?
This exhibit just opened yesterday.
I don't know how this is possible.
It was a prank or some sort of dare.
It's a 3,000-year-old Mummy that's missing, officer.
It's Detective and it's not like it was covered in gold.
I mean he wasn't a king or a prince or even a royal food taster.
He was just some guy who happened to die, got himself wrapped up, and was found in a pretty, cracked box.
He probably mummified himself.
He hasn't had his coffee yet.
Has anyone found the night watchman?
- I'm afraid not.
- Night watchman: Douglas F. Hastings, burglary on his record.
- Technically, burglary is a felony.
- Two charges dropped.
Don't you people run background checks?
Doug was a very good employee who's been here seven years.
And we have a complex security system.
Which was due to be overhauled last spring.
We pushed it back.
We have a very abulic board of Directors.
Good, I'd like to speak with each one of them as soon as the sun rises.
Now if you'll forgive us, we have several high-profile cases that don't involve archaic security systems in rundown buildings.
O'Hara, put out an apb on the guard's vehicle, look up the word "abulic" and meet us back at the station.
Just a minute!
I don't know who you are, Detective, but this was no prank.
The alarm was triggered from the inside.
And although our archaic security footage was limited to rotating shots of the four main rooms, not a single image shows the culprit or the Mummy being carried from the building.
She's right.
It's all right here.
The mummy disappeared in 15 seconds or less and our main feed picked up none of it.
This all cracks of something larger than petty crime.
And not to sound too Shirley McClain, screams of something potentially supernatural.
This requires someone with skills beyond the normal person.
I want him.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
Do you think he's up?
Hello?
Jules!
Actually I'm wide awake.
Why do you ask?
You want to watch a movie together over the phone?
Please say it's father of the bride two.
How about Captain Ron?
Pure luck?
You don't have anything with Martin Short?
Hold on a second.
Well, you don't have to get snippy.
You're the one that drunk-dialed me.
Really?
I just assumed I mean, it's 4:25, right?
The Museum?
Are you kidding?
They love me down there.
You see my plaque?
- What's wrong?
- They only put one name on there.
- So?
- So Gus is gonna have an aneurysm, and not the good kind.
Spencer, we can rehash good times later.
Right now I really need you to create some semblance of focus.
Missing Mummy, missing guard, old security system.
Please tell our feisty little assistant curator that this was not some elaborate break-in so we can all go home.
Okay, I'll try.
That a real beaver?
- Shawn Spencer.
- I know.
- Sophie Morris Bridgewell.
- I know.
- Everyone certainly loves you down here.
- And I love you Metaphorically.
What?
You had your shot.
Let me do what I do.
Excuse me, I'll need some space.
Thank you.
Have it.
Have it.
Want it.
Have it.
Mine's bigger.
- I have a problem.
- What is it?
The layout of this display is horrible.
Who designed this?
It's ridiculous.
Really?
We need two of these?
- Queen Nurfurtittie.
- Nefertiti.
I've heard it both ways.
Well?
I'm gonna have to concur with Detective Carlito Lassiteros on this one.
That Mummy was not stolen, Ms. Bridgewell.
- Great.
- I'm afraid it walked out All on its own.
The Mummy walked out?
Come on, you're just trying to impress - that pretty little assistant curator.
- Was she pretty?
I hadn't noticed.
Really?
Brown eyes, languid smile, long slender neck of a balanchine dancer.
I had three different hairstyles last week and you didn't comment on one.
Look, I felt that something got up out of that coffin and walked away, not to the exit, but to the body of the museum.
Good, you're here.
All of you in my office.
Sweet, now you got us in trouble.
What I have to say is very difficult.
If this in any way pertains to Lassiter's third testicle, I'm afraid we already know.
This is no time for jokes, Mr. Spencer.
When I accepted this position on an interim basis, the agreement between myself and the mayor was should things work out at an appropriate time, the interim would be removed from the title.
As you know that has not yet happened.
And recently I gave the mayor a deadline, a deadline that has passed without any sort of response.
So effective friday, I'm stepping down as chief.
- What?
- I'm leaving.
You can't do that!
Do they know?
They know.
I'll write a letter.
I'll start a petition.
I'll leak it to the reporter at the mirror.
O'Hara, please.
Thank you.
I appreciate the sentiment, but the die is cast.
Chief Are you sure you don't want to wait it out just a little bit longer?
- You never - No, Mr. Spencer.
So you're saying the job is open.
What?
I mean, did anyone mention my name?
I believe they have someone in mind.
But you don't know if it's me.
Look, chief, let me just offer that I think you're a great chief.
And, I'm sure things will all work out.
That's all for now.
Go.
What are you watching?
Security videos from the Museum.
Videos?
As in actual video tapes?
Well, their system could use an overhaul.
Where are the tapes from the other cameras?
That's it.
- One tape?
- Yeah, it's on a rotation.
It's actually not a bad system, you know?
It appears you can't leave the Museum without getting caught by the cameras.
So it's efficient.
Maybe.
We should, probably check it out for ourselves, though.
- What say you?
- Sure.
There's one thing you should probably know before we get there.
"Paleo-sleuth Shawn Spencer".
- I know.
- I dug that thing up too.
Gus, believe me, I was appalled myself at first Sickened, really.
But then I noticed, look, the didn't forget you completely.
- Where?
- There, right there!
The "photo by" section.
That says "photo by Bruton Gaster".
Well I gave 'em the info when I was driving through a tunnel, so that probably played a role.
I want a new plaque, Shawn.
I want it tomorrow.
I want my name in big yellow letters that blink.
And why won't you even tell me what this museum case is about?
In time, in time.
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.
Mr. Spencer, very good to see you again.
And you must be Mr. Gastor.
Guster, Burton Guster.
You people ever hear of spell checker?
I was just giving gasty here all the specifics.
Yes, well the exhibit just opened yesterday afternoon without a hitch.
- The alarm went off at 3:00 a. m. - I was here at 5:00.
A. m.?
You were not.
- I was, I was working.
- Doing what?
It was a private case.
Look, I don't think we should bore Ms. Bridgewell here with the complexities of our other investigations.
You're not tailing cheating boyfriends again, are you?
- Gus, come on.
I'm trying to look cool.
- I told you before, Shawn.
We are bigger than that.
We cleared, like, 50 bucks on the last one.
Gus psychic-client privilege and what not?
Come on.
- Shall we continue?
- Yes, this way.
- What's wrong with you?
- You stole my picture!
So the bulk of the activity seems to have occurred in here.
Yes, I can see it.
The lid sliding off the being rising up, walking across the floor not unlike an egyptian.
Gus could show you.
- Gus!
- Nope.
- No what?
- You know I'm not walking into that room, Shawn.
Come on, dude.
I thought this was over in the sixth grade.
What's wrong?
He won't break the plane of the Mummy room.
Why not?
He's afraid of being cursed.
- He's not that far off base really.
- Please don't coddle him.
Every one of those guys that unearthed tut's tomb Cursed.
- They're all dead now.
- Of course they are.
That was over 80 years ago.
Come on, man.
This is gonna be good for you.
Walk to me.
Face your fears.
You can talk all you want, but facts and logic will win out this time.
Facts and logic are in the corner of the guy who thinks he's gonna get his face melted off?
I'm not hearing it, Shawn.
Well you wanted to check the cameras, right?
Will you set foot in the security camera room?
This system's actually better than I thought.
Even if you make it out of one room, you get picked up in the next room immediately.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna try and beat the system.
Watch me, just on the center screen.
See if I can get out.
- All I gotta do is sit here fine.
- Yeah, we'll communicate on the phone, - so give me a call.
- No, you call me.
This is my work cell.
- I'm not paying for that call.
- Gus, it's usage minutes.
It doesn't matter which one of us makes the call.
Just call me, Shawn.
Fine.
I'm sorry, I can't let this go.
It's a monthly plan.
It's a minutes plan.
Can we get started with this thing now?
I saw that.
Got it on two angles.
Do you want to give this up any time soon?
You're crawling.
I see you, Shawn.
You're behind the plant.
See you there.
See you there.
The plant is moving across the room, Shawn.
Leave that poor lady alone, Shawn.
You're using the carpet?
Really?
Wait a minute I almost bought that for a second.
You're using the wolf pelt?
This is like watching entrapment if instead of Catherine Zeta-Jones - they had some guy with pancake butt.
- I do not have pancake butt!
- What you got?
You got something?
- Yep.
Really?
You can see me right now?
- Horrid, Shawny boy.
- Horrid.
Great, now I gotta watch this?
You're muting me?
For the first interesting thing that's happened?
"Look at me, look at me.
"I love my hair.
"I can make obscure '80s references "that nobody understands.
"Laugh at me.
"Hey, know something about me?
"I have a motorcycle, but I never seem to be riding it".
- How about this?
Are you seeing this?
- Yep.
- How about now?
You see this?
- Terrible.
- How about this?
You seeing this?
- If you're gonna hide under a barrel, don't put the phone next to your ear.
You're getting all of this?
You can see all of this?
Yep.
Whoa, I lost you.
There you are.
Ha!
I got you.
For one second, Shawn.
Trying that corner again?
Please.
Shawn?
Eh great.
Now you wore down my battery.
Where are you?
How about now?
Bingo.
I'm sure you can understand, Mr. Wyles, why I've been so motivated by what I've uncovered in this investigation.
Well, all I know, detective, is I certainly seem to see your name in the paper every day.
Really?
Which paper would that be, because you know I've missed some of the coverage.
- Can we just get on with what you want?
- Of course.
It's really just more of a formality than anything.
I wasn't even going to call you in today.
I just need to go over a few bank records and see some papers - and exhume your father's body.
- I'm sorry.
What was that last one?
It's just more of a technical detail than anything exhuming your father's body.
I mean, you wouldn't even have to be there.
I could have him back in eternal slumber by noon.
- This place is gonna close soon.
- No, it's not.
Shawn, I was in there forever.
Somebody's shutting off the lights with us in here.
Pretty sure that's a timer.
Why would they set a timer with people still in here?
'Cause the museum closed 20 minutes ago?
How did they close it with us inside?
Well, remember I said I talked to Sophie the curator?
She's very sweet, by the way.
She loves Red Robin.
Isn't that a strange favorite restaurant.
You're going behind the tarp?
Really?
There's an exit behind the tarp?
You're probably gonna be eaten by carpet beetles.
Look, I discovered a number of intriguing things when I was figuring out how to crack the security cameras, including an exhibit that looked like it had already been broken into, so what I'm thinking is whoever did it might come back because anyone on the inside knows that there's no night guard on duty and And what?
- Sophie said it was cool.
- What was cool?
Come on, man.
Haven't you ever wanted to spend a night in the museum?
You know, do it up with all the stuffed creatures and the bones?
No, Shawn, I haven't.
I can't spend the night in the museum.
I don't have my tooth brush.
I don't have any of my multivitamins.
And oh, yeah, I don't want my soul suffering eternal damnation for disrupting the sleep of an egyptian canal digger.
Come on, dude!
With hastings on the lam, they're fresh out of night watchmen.
Sophie was actually quite happy that I offered.
She's taking me to dinner.
What do they have at Red Robin?
Come on, Gus.
They didn't get what they were looking for the first time.
Maybe they'll break in again.
We'll be here to catch 'em red-handed.
Won't that be cool?
Dude, there's probably a sensor of some sort.
Take a step back.
Okay, now try it.
- What's on the hill?
- That's freedom, Shawn.
- Does that look like a camera?
- No, no one's gonna leave their camera - outside in the mist so it can get ruined.
- Looks like a camera to me.
- We caught a break.
- We caught a break.
Hastings, that security guard from the Museum who's still missing, had a few assault charges on his record that never went to trial.
Hastings is way more violent than we thought.
- And we found the car finally.
- They found his car.
- Yeah, it was in the shop actually.
- But you didn't find him?
No, the shop gave him a loaner.
I just thought I would let you know, give you a heads up, see if you come up with anything.
- What kind of car is the loaner?
- Gray GMC pickup.
- Don't be mad.
- Why would I be mad?
I'm locked in a museum with possibly a violent criminal and probably an angry Mummy spirit.
And here's a bonus: we have no phones.
- I told you to charge that phone.
- You did not.
I didn't?
Does thinking it count?
They might have a snack bar.
You know, maybe that truck wasn't gray, dude.
Maybe it was, like, a deep midnight blue or a black or a nicekelly green.
It's hard to know for sure.
You know, the cones in the eyes make it possible to see at night.
I know how the eyes work, Shawn.
I just hope I still have mine in the morning.
- Where exactly are we?
- He's here.
He's gonna come back.
He's gonna kill us.
Dude, I never said Hastings stole the thing.
No, you think the actual Mummy walked out.
That makes me feel better.
Don't go all "glass half empty" on me.
Let me show you what I found.
What is wrong.
With this flag?
Everything.
- Besides that.
- I don't know.
- It's upside-down.
- And backwards.
What's your point?
It's dust gathered on the bottom of the frame.
That means somebody eitherturned it upside-down or knocked it over.
Whoa, I lost you for a second.
There you are.
And this little nook is not in camera range.
It's not a nook.
What would you call it?
It's clearly not a corner.
Cranny?
Will you sign off on Cranny?
- Why am I here, Shawn?
- Because somebody didn't want the camera to see what ever happened in this Cranny.
- I never signed off on Cranny.
- There's nothing here, Gus.
It's just a bunch of old guns.
And not even nice ones at that.
The lexan glass case that houses it is worth more.
- Lexan glass?
- Yeah, it's bullet proof.
Well, it would have to be in case the guns decided to fire them selves.
Lexan glass.
What?
That's common know ledge, Shawn.
People know that.
Who, people in Charlton Heston's house?
Yes, and your Mama.
Did you hear that?
Nobody's here but us.
I tried, Shawn.
I can't do this.
Gus, don't bea traveling wilbury.
- Look, Christine's here.
- Will you stop it, Shawn?
Relax, it's not eventhe right color.
Dude.
We have got to get one of these for the office.
How much you think these things run?
- I don't know.
- How heavy are they?
That was actually kind of scary, Gus.
Come on, dude!
It's just the motor on the fridge!
Of course, why would an exhibit be plugged in?
The sign says do not touch, Shawn.
Not anymore.
- It's stuck, though.
- It's supposed to be stuck.
To keep people like you out.
People who what?
People who spend the night in Museums to investigate Mummies that may have walked out on their own?
You are here.
What are you doing?
Bidding for Talismans.
Talismen.
I don't care what they're called, Shawn.
I'm acquiring protection for the spiritual injustice we caused in the Museum.
- You can buy wolfsbane online?
- In bulk.
Now I just gotta find somebody to Loan me a cat.
- You got McNabb's number?
- Come on, Gus.
I thought that, at the very least, finding the guard dead would help you jump on the band wagon that, hey, this is a real flesh and blood killer.
He was killed by the Mummy, Shawn.
You don't know that.
You have no proof.
Okay, fine, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you I signed us up for night guard duty.
And I'm sorry I didn't tell you there was a Mummy involved.
But we have a legitimate trail now.
The cops are taking this seriously.
I need you!
I need the sweet blue shirt, I need the pants.
I need the winsome smile that hides the sad Jamaican clown inside.
We need to call Lassiter and we are not going back to the Museum.
No more Mummy room, no more Spooky stuff.
I promise.
He's exhuming a body?
He is casually disturbing what should be the passing of a great and dignified man.
Yeah, he does that.
White socks, black shoes.
What's the rule on that?
Don't you have to be wearing jeans?
What's the rule?
Come on dude.
I honestly had no idea he was gonna be pulling a corpse from the ground.
Don't worry about it, Shawn.
I honestly didn't know I was gonna be putting my foot in your ass.
Life's full of surprises.
I got the coroner's report on the guard Hastings.
At least stay for this, see how silly it is to be afraid of Mummies.
What do you got, Jules?
- You're not gonna like it.
- We're not gonna like it.
- I'm sure we'll be able to make something of it.
- Hastings was strangled to death.
No magic involved there.
And correct me if I'm wrong Jules, but you can actually get fingerprints off strangulation victims.
- I'm afraid that's not possible.
- Why is that?
The hand was wrapped in some sort of cloth.
Cloth?
There were linen fibers embedded into the guard's neck.
Clearly that was just to cover his prints.
We also found dust and spores that weren't from this area.
Well, maybe the cleaning crew didn't come around.
Only if they didn't come around for over 3,000 years.
The spores came from inside the coffin.
Thanks, Jules.
Finally!
Finally what?
- I've been leaving message son your phone.
- Yeah, I sor tof dropped my phone.
Yeah, what'd I tell youa bout taking care of your stuff?
You know what?
You're right.
First my tricycle out in the yard, now this.
- I see a pattern developing here.
- All right, look, Shawn, I was hoping we could talk alone.
No offense, Gus.
- Di!
- No no, don't you dare.
We are here to talk to you and this is urgent.
- So is mine.
- Ours involves a dead guy.
- Why do you always have to win, Shawn?
- 'Cause we're winners.
Fine, what is it?
Go ahead.
Okay, what do you do when your best suspect.
Sort of, just.
- Say it, Shawn.
- Doesn't exist anymore?
People disappear all the time, Shawn.
Some are very good at it.
Especially a career criminal.
Yeah, this is a little more complicated.
Look, it doesn't matter who you're talking about here, Shawn.
But when the trail goes cold, you do what every good cop does.
You follow the time line.
You trace back the steps that led to the trail going cold.
- Back ground check.
- Exactly.
Perfect.
Perfect, dad!
But I wanna see you later, without Gus.
I need to talk to you.
Okay, what is this?
What is all this "without Gus" stuff?
I mean, it's Gus.
Just say it.
- Say what it is.
What is it?
- Okay.
All right.
I got a phone calla couple of days ago and I don't know if you have any plans, but Are you busy on saturday?
You want me to come with you to awkward class?
Forget it.
See ya!
Detectives, that's very thoughtful of you, but I just don't want youto make a big fuss.
We are not going to make a fuss.
Detective Lassiter and I just ant to throw you a going away party.
It's going to be very William Wyles the beud.
It was formerly believed that Wyles' death was due to an accidental fall down the stairs of his Montecito home.
But now a former employee has come forward to say.
she heard loud arguing coming from the Wyles's study the night of his death.
Contrary to the belief that Wyles was alone the night he died.
Santa Barbara police detective Carlton Lassiter, who's been leading this investigation, was unavailable for comment.
Unavailable for comment?
I've been here all day.
Who's not giving me my messages?
Cupcakes.
Right, of course.
With little cuffs on them.
And, sprinkles.
We're really gonna miss you.
Wyles, who became a publishing magnate at the age of 30, was one of Santa Barbara's leading philanthropists and a major contributor to political campaigns.
As well as a well-known collector of war Memorabilia.
At his height, he owned more than 30 - How's the back ground check coming?
- Just finished.
Rahm Entottem lived during the 19th dy Nasty of Egypt.
Probably near Giza.
He had 11 sons, all of whom spent their days smelting metal from the orealong the banks of the Nile.
Smelters?
Perhaps you misunderstood.
We don't care what he did when he was living.
Only since he's been a Mummy.
Let's do this.
First, he was on display for six months in Cincinnati.
He didn't kill anybody there.
Then he was on Loan, Plano, Texas.
Nobody had their eyes or internal organs stolen there.
- What's that?
- It's a bowl of Chili.
- And who's that up there?
- It's Austin kerns.
Would you pay attention?
Then he was transported for two days by truck, spent the evening in the Museum ware house, and boom, was on display first thing the next morning.
Mine's Better.
Yeah, but mine's something sensible that people might utilize.
So you'rethe sensible one now?
- More and more lately.
- Okay.
All right, let's work back wards.
We just did.
This is as close as I get to that Museum.
I know.
Quick, put that on.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm working with Sophie and the Museum.
This is my partner Paddy Simcox.
We're wondering if there's any documentation on the arrival of the rock 'em sock 'em Mummy.
Rahmentottem.
Or has there been any instances of things exploding for no apparent reason?
I don't know nothing.
- And I don't think you guys should be in here.
- Right.
Perhaps I'll call Sophie and let her know you're not being very helpful.
Listen, all I have security access for is this room.
Well, then let us know what happens here, man!
Here at the docks!
Fine, it's simple.
That thing shows up, a Museum rep comes and does an inspection.
And then we put it out on the floor.
I wish that there was more that I could tell you.
Dude, it's a tripod.
I told you that was a tripod.
With a camera.
Coming back.
Hey, wait up!
What are you doing?
Left your keys in the trunk lock.
I'm sorry.
I know I promised not to shoot there.
I know you guys said you'd call the cops, but I just need one more night for my project to be done.
- Your project?
- My film project.
- Aren't you guys with the - Yes, we are.
- With who?
- Who ever you think we're with.
- The Museum?
- Yes, exactly.
And you are a film student?
Yes, working on night cycle.
It's my thesis project.
It's just the life cycle of a wild flower at the top of the hill.
- The name of your film is night cycle?
- What's wrong with that?
Well, it's kind of boring.
Unless it's about a motorcycle that comes to life at night and solves crime and does sweet whee lies.
Listen, I alread y told the guy in the Jumpsuit.
I mean, you could barely see the Museum in the background.
- I just needed to frame it up that way.
- You have foot age of the Museum.
Yeah, but it won't infringe on anyone's copyright, I can guarantee it.
Do you have stuff from tuesday night?
Yeah, but not on me.
Here it is.
A standard video camera runs at 30 frames per second.
- Yeah, we know that.
- How would we know that?
It's common know ledge, Shawn.
And technically it's 29.97.
Unless you're working in HD, then it's 23.98 partially segmented frames.
Regard less, for time lapse I set it for one frames for minute.
So everything moves faster.
- 30 times faster.
- 1,800 times faster.
- I knew that.
I was testing you.
- Sure you did.
Okay Guys, what are we looking for here, exactly?
It's pretty simple.
A crime occurre dat the Museum on this particular evening.
We just wanna know if your camera caught any foot age of it.
It's nothing too crazy.
And most likely there's a crazed Mummy out and about strangling people willy-nilly.
Yes.
And that.
This is 3:00 am.
Slow it down here.
This is kind of exciting.
Holy crap.
Gus, can you believe it?
Gus?
He's a little scared of Mummies.
Dude, it's just a film!
- Video.
- Even better.
No one can reach through the screen and grab you.
That's so weird.
We only saw him for one frame and then, you know, he walked out and poof.
He's gone.
Wait.
The lights on the van.
Dude, he took that van.
The Mummy?
Great.
Now we got a Mummy on the loose and the son of a bitch know show to drive a stick?
- Now we know how he got away.
- We need to call the Police.
No, not yet.
- I've seen that van.
- You know where it is?
Unless it's moved in the last two hours, I do.
What the.
Dude, I told you it was here.
I told you I saw it!
What are you doing?
Turning the cararound, Shawn.
Dude, she's not even gonna be in California by the time we get out of here.
Just keep turning the wheel!
- I don't wanna hit anything, Shawn!
- This is a company car.
Dude, you got it.
You clearly had it after the se Really?
The 11-point turn, dude?
This is a prime example of a situation best handled by the Police.
- Or a witch doctor.
- It's not a Mummy, Gus.
You keep saying that, and it keeps coming up Mummy.
No way he makes that turn.
Slow down.
He hit a tree.
- Let's go get him.
- I'm not getting out there.
Dude, they hit a tree.
Who ever they are, they're not moving.
They're incapacitated.
They could be hurt, maybe even dead.
Maybe undead.
- They might need our help.
- Or our internal organs!
- Let's call the police.
- With whose phone?
All right, fine.
I'm bringing my bat.
Grab some flash lights.
Shawn, I think I think this may be the most terrifying moment of my life.
You're confronting it head on.
I'm so proud of you, buddy.
I think I just saw someone running away in the woods.
Look!
That door's cracked!
I don't think anybody's here.
How sure are you?
Fairly to pretty damn.
Good, because I don't think I can take one more.
Shawn?
I am telling you, Carly town, you gotta come with uson this!
And I'm telling you, I'm about to solve the biggest case of my career.
So which do you think I'd rather do?
The old man didn't die from a fall down the stairs.
Initial findings indicate he had blunt force trauma to his head before he fell.
So unless you've gota psychic answer for that, you guys can run along.
Crud.
Now Wyles isn't answering his phone.
I have the final coroner's report on that exhumed body.
It was definitely a head trauma.
And it turns out that unidentified matter found in his skull was a chip of ivory.
Great.
But I have the best reveal ever.
Spencer, we'll get to your little mummy thing later.
Quite honestly, I only took the case because Wyles IV is on the board of trustees.
I thought I could do a little snooping, but all I got was dead ends.
I can solve both cases!
- You can what?
- Lassie, call Wyles on his cell phone.
He'll pick that up because he's not at home.
Dude, we got it.
- Oh, we are good!
- Then meet us at the Museum.
Why can't they just meet usat a well-lit Starbucks?
One more time, buddy.
For justice.
- Why am I here?
- You'll find out soon enough.
But whatever it is, I'm taking full credit for it.
Just cooperate with us, Mr. Wyles.
Things don't look very good for you right now.
- Yeah, well, I'll have your job.
- Well, it's too late for that.
Someone else already does.
Shawn!
Don't worry, Sophie.
I'm being very gentle.
I laid down a blanket and everything.
Not my first time alone in a coffin.
By the way.
Playing dead, awesome.
- What is this nonsense?
- He's solving a case.
Actually, I'm solving two cases.
But let's take them one at a time.
First, a being did rise from this coffin.
And walk out of the museum on tuesday night.
Strangled poor Hastings, may he rest in peace, with his bare hands.
Correction, - linen-wrapped hands.
- Thank you.
I was the first one to say that it was a Mummy.
But that being was not the mummy.
- Rub-my-bottom.
- Rahmentottem.
That mummy never made it into the museum.
No, that mummy never made it out of the white van in the parking lot.
It was swapped out by an angry warehouse foreman on wheels.
It was all part of an elaborate break-in.
This is absolute insanity.
An interesting choice of words.
I thought for sure you'd say genius.
- Well, why would I say genius?
- Because it was your plan.
My plan?
You're the one that got into the snuffalupagus wrapped in just enough tea-stained linen to look like a mummy through the cracked lid.
You needed to get those pistols back, didn't you?
Yeah, the ones that used to be at the top of the stairs in your father's house.
Especially that one with the chipped ivory handle.
- Which.
- Which was the murder weapon!
Come on, Lass.
A little consideration, please?
I mean, look.
I'm going all out with the cloth and thing here.
I'm doing my thing.
- Detectives.
- You knocked your father on the head with that pistol, let him fall to his death, and then ran out and waited for somebody else to find him.
And the pistol got willed to the Museum.
That's why you worked so hard to get that exhibit closed.
And delayed the installation of the new security system.
He couldn't get his way into the display.
But he needed to be in the Museum.
You have been a busy little boy, haven't you?
I believe you will be my final Santa Barbara arrest, Mr. Wyles.
Put your hands behind your back, sir.
Nice, nice but guys, check it out.
There's more, right?
He tilted the camera so that he wouldn't be visible.
He he strangled Hastings so there wouldn't be a witness!
I saw him run away in the forest!
Gus?
Is there any chance at all you'll stay?
No.
But I'm sure we'll see each other around.
Look, I knew the mayor wanted Raymond Sauter for the job.
He's an old friend of his.
But Sauter didn't become available until recently.
So I did what I had to do.
Look, I'm sure Sauter will do a fine job.
Are you sure you'll have a use for this?
Dude, you're being kind of insensitive.
She'll be fine.
Phone.
It's the mayor.
Yes, sir?
Well, yes.
But Of course.
Yes, that's Sir, you don't have to beg.
You are begging.
As of now?
Okay.
- I'm the new chief.
- Not interim?
Don't you dare call me that again.
Oh, my god, what happened?
What did he say?
- I honestly have no idea.
- I think I do.
What's this?
Bumped my arrest to page two.
Congratulations, Karen.
Thank you.
- We should have a party!
- We should definitely have a party.
- We have all the party accoutrements!
- Just go get some party gear and just open some crackers and a bottle of something.
Shawn, are you sure you didn't get some sort of special message this week?
Dad, I told you, I dropped my phone.
Now, I gotta go.
No no, Shawn!
Look, there's something I gotta get off my chest before you leave here!
Dad, I don't know if you just read the secret or watched an emotional Oprah or what.
But I don't think we're ready to open our souls to each other.
- Well, we have no choice, kid.
- But we do, and it's good.
Because what we have is simple and shallow and unobtrusive.
So let's have this conversation when you're 90 and maybe on an oxygen tank.
'Cause I have a date with a woman who runs a Museum.
- And that's new for me.
- No, Shawn!
- Please, no!
- It just feels good.
You know what, I'll grab the door for you on my way out!
Mom.
