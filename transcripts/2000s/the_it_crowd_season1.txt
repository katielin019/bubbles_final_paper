{START OF EPISODE 1}
Hope this doesn't embarrass you Jen, but I found the best thing to do with the new employee is to size them up with a long hard stare.
- So!
- So.
- First day!
- Yes!
- Scary?
- Yes - Don't be scared!
- Oh, I'm not really scared.
You should be!
- Well I'm a little bit scared.
- What?
Don't be!
Make up your mind!
So here you are!
Yes.
I'm really looking forward to - getting to grips with the - I'm gonna put you in I.T. Because you said on your CV you had a lot of experience with computers.
I did say that on my CV, yes.
I have lots of experience with the whole computer thing you know, e-mails sending e-mails, receiving e-mails, deleting e-mails - I could go on.
- Do!
The Web Using mouse mices using mice.
Clicking double clicking the computer screen of course, the keyboard the bit that goes on the floor down there - The hard drive?
- Correct.
Well, you certainly seem to know your stuff.
That settles.
Got a good feeling about you Jen!
And they need a new manager.
Oh, fantastic!
So, the people I'll be working with, what're they like?
Standard nerds!
Hello I.T.?
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
OK, well, the button on the side, is it glowing?
Yeah, you need to turn it on!
The button, turns it on?
!
Yeah You Yeah You do know how a button works, don't you?
No, not on clothes!
Hello, I.T.?
Yeah?
Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot?
No, no!
There you go!
No, there you go, I just heard it come on.
No, no, that's the music you hear when it comes on.
No, that's the music you hear when I'm sorry, are you from the past?
!
See the driver hooks a function by patching the system call table.
So it's not safe to unload it, unless another thread's about to jump in there and do its stuff.
And you don't want to end up in middle of invalid memory.
Hello?
Oh, really?
Why don't you come down here and make me then?
What?
You think I'm afraid of you?
I'm not afraid of you!
You can come down here any time and I'll be waiting for ya!
That told her!
Oh, God, it's about time you got back, it's been all go.
You had a job?
Girl on fifth Did you and her hit it off?
Define "hit it off"?
Did she continue talking to you once you'd fixed her computer?
No And while I was working on it, she rested a cup on my back.
- No?
!
- Yep!
Unbelievable!
Yeah, I mean they've not respect for us up there, no respect whatsoever!
- We're all just drudgens to them.
- Yes!
If there were such a thing as a drudgen, that is what we'd be to them.
It's like they're pally-wally when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed They toss us away like yesterday's jam!
Yes!
Yesterday's jam!
That is what we are to them!
Actually you know what?
That doesn't really work as a thing because you know, jam lasts for ages Hello, I.T.?
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
Unisex toilets?
You have unisex toilets, like Ally McBeal?
That's the sort of place this is, Jen.
A lot of sexy people not doing much work and having affairs.
Oh, my God!
Look at that view!
I feel like I'm on top of the world.
Well Jen, this is where I leave you.
Floor 34.
Great sir, thank you.
OK.
Where am I going?
All the way down to the basement.
Good luck!
Get out of the lift - Oh.
Won't be a tick!
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
OK.
Hello?
Hello?
Yes, I believe it was Tolstoy who said Oh, it seems we have a visitor.
I'm sorry, myself and Morris were just engaged in quite a serious discussion about books and such.
We didn't hear you come in.
Wait a second, you said it was Tolstoy, he said what?
Oh, never mind that now, Morris!
When have you read Tolstoy?
Shut up, Morris!
Why are you speaking that weird voice?
When did I don't remember this conversation at all!
Don't let me disturb you, I just wanted to come-- Don't be silly you never dist-- Many people come down here to visit!
What are you talking about?
Who comes down?
What people?
Why are you giving me the secret signal to shut up?
!
So What can we do you for?
I'm the new head of this department.
Is this my office?
Why?
What did she-- Did she just say what I-- - I am the head of this department!
- I thought I was.
It's one of us!
Certainly not her!
- I'm gonna sort this out - Roy, you've got a head wound there-- Head wound!
Hi!
I don't wanna be rude or anything but I wasn't informed of any changes to this department.
Oh, did they not tell you about me?
No!
And we are perfectly fine down here, thank you very much, we're more than capable of taking care of ourselves.
Sure sure You know you're covered in blood?
Moss!
- Amazon thingy.
- Ah!
Wicked!
I know what this is.
It's the new Harry Potter.
I got the child edition and the adult edition just to check that there are no differences in the text.
Sorry but I'm not gonna be able to deal with that woman!
Is nobody else going to get the phone?
I suppose I'll get it!
No, that is not a phone.
I'm gonna have a little lie down.
Come in!
Yeah, Denholm.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no, no No, they've been fine so far.
Yeah.
I think we're gonna get on great.
Yeah, I know.
All right then, now you take care.
All right, yeah I will, yeah.
Ok!
Ok, take care, take care!
Ok, bye!
Bye!
Oh, so, hello!
What can I do you fo-- What can I do for you?
Hello.
I was just wondering Do you want me to connect up your phone?
No, no, no No.
It's working.
I was just talking to Denholm.
But how?
!
Oh, do you mind Do you mind closing the door for me?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Yeah, Ok.
Yeah.
From the other side Of course.
- Like this?
- That's it!
- With me on the - Thanks!
Are you all right?
Oh, yes, Moss, I'm fine!
The nurse said I didn't do myself any serious damage.
I'm standing over here!
I know, I know, I'm joking, I'm fine!
What are we gonna do about her?
Well, I just went in, and she was having a pretend conversation.
- Really?
- Yes.
She's a little bit weird, to say the least.
What's that?
Oh, just water.
Sometimes, I get a hot ear, and this helps cool it down.
She is quite the oddbod Did you notice how she didn't even get excited when she saw this original ZX-IT 1?
Yeah, that was weird.
It's almost as if she doesn't know anything about computers.
What?
!
Look what you did!
Oh, don't worry that's why I always make two cups of tea.
Anyway, what were we talking about?
Oh, her not knowing anything about computers.
What?
!
Ok, so we definitely want to get rid of her.
I agree, yeah.
Ok, so, here's the plan: A plan?
Let me put on my slightly larger glasses.
Ok, hit me!
- Ok.
We go in - When?
You know, like in a minute.
Will that be enough time for me to get to know the plan?
Yeah, you know what?
I shouldn't have used the word "plan"!
I've clearly gotten you over-excited!
Would "steamed" be a better word?
Although that's just as exciting, I might even use these.
All I was gonna say was We go in, I make up a load of bullocks about computers and we'll see if she picks up on it.
Yes.
I can see why you didn't want to use the word "plan".
- Let me do the talk.
- All right.
Ouh, Moss, Moss Moss!
Ok, we need to get this right, you know?
We we need to stay calm.
We do not wanna go in there half-cocked.
Hang on, guys.
How can I help?
Well, we were just wondering now that you're "The Boss", would you like us to access the data supplier and connect you up to the matrix?
You just made all that up?
You don't know anything about computers, admit it!
Will you stop trying to undermine me!
Now get in there, and do some work, to do with computers!
I'll be in there in a minute to check up on you!
Ok, lady!
You've won this round, but we can wait!
You will slip up one day, and believe you me, we will be there when you do!
There will be some piece of evidence that will prove without any shadow of a doubt that you don't know anything about computers.
What are you doing?
Plugging in your computer.
It might be something you say or something you do!
But when we notice this, and believe me we will notice this, there's gonna be a long way down for you, sweet chicks!
He'll realise in a second I cannot believe you're going to tell on me.
You're like a pair of horrible old women.
What did she say?
She said we're like horrible old women.
She didn't!
Hey guys!
Ok, got something to tell me?
Yes, well, it's like this: Look at you!
My I.T. Team.
Yeah.
Team players each and every one of you.
Yeah, what she There's no room for people who can't act in a team on my team!
Excuse me.
Hello?
What?
!
Well if you can't work as a team, you're all fired!
That's it, you heard me, fine!
Get your things and go!
Hello, Security?
Everyone on floor 4 is fired.
Escort them from the premises.
And do it as a team!
Remember you're a team, and if you can't act as a team, you're fired too!
Dawn!
Get onto recruitment.
Tell them to look for a security team that can work as a team.
They may have to escort our security team from the building, for not acting like a team!
Team!
Team team team team team!
I even love saying the word "team".
You probably think that's a picture of my family?
It's the A-Team.
Body, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery Man!
All of them!
So what do you wanna tell me?
Well, it's just not working out.
- He's joking!
- But you said Not working out?
Oh, no!
No!
We are getting on like a big house on fire!
- Yeah!
- My ear's getting hot!
No You know what?
We should leave, now, because you know, you're a busy man and we've taken far too much of your time.
Jen could you just get the door for me there?
Absolutely Roy!
So why did you come here in the first place?
We set up a voice activation system on your computer.
I think you're gonna enjoy it.
It might just take a little while to get the pitch right on the voice but nonetheless, go ahead!
Thank you very much!
- Bye bye!
- Thank you!
How exciting!
Hello Hello computer!
Hello!
Hello Hello computer What good are you?
You obviously don't know anything about computers.
No, but OK.
But I can learn.
You know, I mean, for example, Moss, you could take me through what you're doing right now.
I'd be delighted!
I'm just working on a very simple piece of programming code.
I see Oh, God, no, I'm lying again!
I didn't understand any of that!
I don't know anything about computers, I mean I'm absolutely useless to you.
I might as well pack up and go home.
Hi!
Is Roy around?
Hello there little lady!
Are you lost?
How can I help you?
I'm Roy.
You wanted me to come down?
!
Well here I am!
!
Not the face!
!
Not the face!
!
Well maybe this will teach you to treat people with a little bit of respect!
Is it 'cos we spoke on the phone earlier?
Oh, my God!
Are those Manolo's?
Yes!
They are gorgeous!
Were they expensive?
No, no, no, no!
Got them in a sale.
Oh, God!
Clever you!
I'm never lucky enough to get a bargain myself.
Well, I should take you shopping.
Yeah, no, that would be fantastic.
Oh, I will give you a call.
Nice to meet you!
Take care!
- Nice meeting you!
- Chairman!
Wow!
You just diffuse that entire situation!
What situation?
Oh, oh, that yeah!
Oh, my God, does that happen a lot?
They're fairly regular, the beatings, yes.
I'd say we're on a by-weekly beatings.
Ah it's not all that bad!
Ah, come on Roy!
It's pretty bad Maybe I could help with this.
You know, I mean I'm a people person and people like you need a person to deal with people a people person like me.
Oh, my God!
Ideas are coming!
Things are happening here!
Ok, Ok, what would you say here, if I told you that I had a plan to raise your profile upstairs by 100%.
What would you say?
I can't be done!
You're crazy!
What would you say Roy?
Roy's passed out!
Ok!
I need a felt-tip pen, and some paper.
PARTY - I.T. DEPT 5.45 TODAY No, no!
Oh, no, really, really, really, that was a true story!
Unbelievable!
I said why we don't go out with the I.T. guys more often?
- You're hilarious!
- Yes, we are!
You guys should come down here more often you know, you should see this as a new era for Reynholm Industries.
"A new era for Reynholm Industries"!
Oh, do you know what!
If you want to hear something really funny, a really funny story, you should hear what happened to Moss and I, when we were so drunk in Amsterdam that Moss lost his glasses!
Moss!
Moss!
Come here!
Come here!
Tell them that story about when we were drunk in Amsterdam.
Really?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh, it's brilliant!
Oh, this a great story, you're gonna love it!
I'm just gonna get another box of wine!
Well go on, then.
All right.
Well, one night, we were really drunk.
Yeah.
And huh, we were so drunk that we decided to hire prostitutes.
And when they arrived to the hotel, we were too scared to do anything, so we brought them to the fair.
Oh, really nice!
In the end, they only charged us half.
But we did have to pay for all the rides.
Oh, isn't that just the best story?
Oh, man!
You told me to never tell that story to anyone.
Well, what're you talking about?
That's a brilliant story!
And then you nearly walked into the canal!
Has it got to that part with the boatman?
Do you mean the story when I lost my glasses?
Yes!
What story did you think I mean?
Moss?
What did you say?
!
What did you say?
!
It's all right for you two.
You're used to being social social piranhas I'm a very popular person usually.
That girl earlier, that tried to beat me to death with her shoes, did anybody get her number?
That was a nice day the fair, wasn't it?
With Brandy and Crystal!
Hello I.T.?
Yeah.
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
Hello!
Hello!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
The IT Crowd - 1x02 - Calamity Jen Has this ever happened to you?
From today, dialling 999 won't get you the emergency services.
And that's not the only thing that's changing.
Nicer ambulances, faster response times, and better looking drivers mean they're not just the emergency services, they're "your" emergency services.
So Remember the new number: That's Hello?
I've had a bit of a tumble Well that's easy to remember!
0118 999 881 999 119 725 3!
I don't know why they just couldn't keep it as it was!
How hard is it to remember 911?
- You mean 999 - I mean 999!
- That's the American one!
- Yeah!
- You berk!
- Come on, are you ready?
I don't know what to say really it's fun there are some many issues in the world, They are beautiful, I love them in fact they're the most beautiful shoes I've ever seen but you know, I can't have everything that I love, otherwise I'd own lots of things, and actually they're red, which is quite tarty, and they don't necessarily go with any of my outfits Come on you crazy bitch!
Come on!
Come on!
- Denholm's called the general.
- Oh God, another one!
Yeah!
I bet he declares war on something!
He loves declaring war!
I am declaring WAR!
I can see that got your attention.
What am I declaring war on?
My bollocks?
!
Stress!
Stress is a disease, people, and I am a cure!
A war on disease!
Stress!
There's too much stress around here.
They're very expensive and besides, the woman in the shop said they were way too small for me.
- You see you know, be practical, go on!
- In the time I've been speaking, over 18 million people have died of stress.
That's another one.
That's another one.
More Mayhem!
We gotta deal with it!
- Are you ready to deal with it?
!
- Yeah!
Say: "I hate stress"!
- I hate stress!
- No!
You didn't let me finish.
Say: "I hate stress" and I want to limitate its influence in my life, what can I do about it?
Anyone?
Have a bath?
Have a bath?
!
Get a bike!
I cycle to work everyday!
70 miles!
Both here, and here are as red as a fire engine!
Any other ideas?
Jen, what about you?
Shoes!
- What?
- Shoes!
Well, shoes Ok, look!
I have invited Dr. Julian Holmes to come and give a class at lunchtime.
He is Europe's leading stress expert.
They call him:" Stressperts"!
Anyone interested in coming along picking up a few tips on how to manage stress?
There's a free buffet Good!
Good people.
Oh!
By the way!
Anyone still experiencing stress at the end of the day will be fired!
It's not going on!
Yeah, I think it is so.
Just down angle it a bit more.
Are you sure you're a 5?
- I'm not a liar.
- Yeah, but I mean I can't Just just I can feel the heel going into the shoe.
Just down angle a bit more There is no angle, but I could Don't let me push you away!
Just lean in with the shoe.
Lean in with the shoe!
Lean in!
We've been here for half an hour.
The shoes aren't going on!
They're two sizes too small.
And even if they did go on, they would cripple you.
You don't want that, do you?
I myself, have been subject to some terrible rages, but Yes?
- I'm sorry.
Is this the stress class?
- Oh yeah.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Moss!
This is in here!
Moss!
Just come in.
Thank you.
Ok.
Are you all right?
As I was saying I myself have been subject to some terrible rages.
Where I've snapped at my wife, or spoken harshly to a work colleague, because of stress.
If I just thinking about it now, I realise I'm raising my voice.
I'm sorry.
Stress is the main cause of heart attacks.
And even a little bit well Let me show you what stress can do.
I'm gonna need a volunteer.
Yes.
Come on up.
That's fine.
Can I have your left hand there?
The back?
And just relax there.
I'm gonna ask you a very personal question.
There we are, you see?
Sorry, I'm not gonna ask you anything at all.
That's just to show how little is needed to send downstress levels shooting up.
Just a simple statement like that is registered very strongly on the display.
- Yes, another volunteer?
- Yeah.
Ok.
I'll have just this off.
Ah!
There it goes!
Yes, raise up!
Look at that!
Brilliant!
Brilliant, excellent!
It's a super machine!
Wow, great shoes!
Thank you very much.
I really envy women with dainty feet.
What are you?
A five?
Yeah!
Five Well, just a little misunderstanding there I imagine.
So - Huh let's move on with - Wow!
I actually haven't had a proper go yet.
Well, I don't need attach can't, what's happened there Actually, I don't think that's fair I would like a go, and I think Roy should be punished for nearly killing that lady.
Well, I think I should go first!
I see, well let's move on - When did you grow a bit?
- A little go.
- We gotta move on - And I think we could Can we just move on?
You're old ?
Are you very old?
Let's move on!
Oh!
Shut up!
What are you eating?
Muffin.
A muffin?
How can you be hungry, you ate a whole chicken at the stress buffet!
What's that?
Oh, I've made a stress machine to try out for myself, like the one in that class.
Watch this.
I'm going to ask myself a very personal question.
Don't worry, I'm not really going to ask myself any questions.
Pretty good.
Not as good as the one in the stress class.
The shoes!
What was all that about?
Well, like all the women, she's shoe mad!
It's a bit sexist, isn't it?
Do you know one woman who isn't obsessed with shoes?
No, but I only know one woman.
And she just left the room shouting: "the shoes"!
.
The needle's freaking out!
Try not to hurt yourself!
- Moss?
- Huh?
Did you use a soldering iron to make that stress machine?
Yes.
You turned it off?
Oh I'm fairly sure I did!
Because, you remember what happened last time, right?
Yes!
That was very funny!
Well no!
No.
It was very dangerous and someone nearly died!
Right!
No!
Yeah!
I was thinking of a different incident.
The one on the golf course.
What?
I'm talking about the fire!
Oh yeah, fire sorry!
I always get mixed up between golf and fire.
- Just make sure it's off!
- It is off.
I think.
- Well just make sure it is.
- I will make sure it is.
And if it's already off I'll just walk away!
Will he get off my back!
What is he?
The soldering iron police?
It's off that means I turn it on and just walk away!
Oh four!
I mean five!
I mean fire!
Now let's see what we have here.
"Stand upright".
Now, I can't read it Oh, not me!
I am a giddy-goat!
Okay.
"Remove safety clip".
- Don't look at my feet!
- Fire?
Fire No?
"Aim nozzle at base of fire".
Oh, that is typical!
Why has it done that?
"Made in Britain" I'll just put this over here, with the rest of the fire.
011 53 No.
011 huh 0118 999 3!
Hello?
Is this the emergency services?
Then which country am I speaking to?
Hello?
Hello?
I know!
Yep.
Okay.
"Subject:" "fire"!
"Dear Sir", stroke, "Madam".
"I'm writing to inform you of a fire "which has broken out at the premises of" No.
That's too formal.
"Dear Sir", stroke, "Madam".
"Fire"!
, exclamation mark.
"Fire"!
, exclamation mark.
"Help me!
', exclamation mark.
"123, Carendon road".
"Looking forward to hearing from you".
"All the best, Maurice Moss".
What are you wearing size 5 shoes for, woman?
You're at least an 8!
Eight?
How dare you?
!
That foot is completely mangled.
And the other one's even worse.
You're not wearing these again.
But I threw away my other shoes, what am I supposed to wear?
Hello!
Hello!
Do you remember me?
Can I have a go in your machine now?
- Oh hello again!
- Oh hi!
Please thank Yamamoto San for this fine ceremonial sword.
It is a magnificent symbol of our new merger.
I am sorry that my gift a huge pair of Doc' Martins, is extremely thick and heavy sorts.
It's so poultry in comparison.
Please rest assured that my cultural advisor will be fired as soon as this meeting is over.
- These are very heavy shoes.
- Yes.
He feels like Godzilla!
Does he?
Godzilla!
Go on!
Stamp your feet!
Clap him man!
Good!
Oh yeah!
The Jap loves it!
Go on!
Break something!
Put your weight into it!
You f idiot!
!
You stupid old f. You f. J. and your big m. shoes!
Oh you're not!
You're nothing!
But I f .
- I am so sorry, Denholm.
- That was quite a tarring Jen.
It would have been even worse if Paul hadn't been so quick on the profanity buzzer.
Well done, Paul!
You're back on the payroll.
As for you you're fucked up!
Shouting at Japs!
Mad feet!
Both classic signs of stress!
And you know how I feel about stress Go to your office, and wait for me.
Weirdest thing just happened Fire!
Fire!
I've sent an e-mail.
It's fine!
An e-mail?
!
It's a fire!
Where Where is the precinct extinguisher ?
- Made in Britain!
- This is just like the golf incident!
You mean the fire incident?
I mean the fire incident!
Of course I mean the fire incident!
What have you got there?
Oh I'm in trouble!
I'm in real trouble!
Help me get my shoes on!
I gotta get my shoes on!
Help me get my shoes on before Denholm comes!
- Denholm's coming?
- Yeah.
And he's got a fire!
Fire!
Fire!
I've taken care of it.
I have to say I feel a little bit insulted by the lack of faith you both display.
What happened to your feet?
What is this?
I think a fire in the office demands a little more attention than my feet, don't you?
How how did you get the stress machine Roy?
I don't really know.
Met Dr. Holmes by the lift.
Wasn't he nice?
I thought he was a lovely man.
Yes I thought he was a delight.
But I met him there by the lift, and he just went mental!
And one thing led to another and I just stole it!
- You stole it - Yeah!
But that's stealing!
Yeah!
Didn't know what a stress machine was this morning and now we have 2 of them.
I hate to remind everyone but I've just destroyed a merger that probably took hundreds of years to set up, the office is on fire, Denholm is furious, so could we please concentrate on what's important, and help me out with my shoes!
That could get you into trouble!
Empty!
Got a little bit there!
Oh quick!
No, no!
Quick, no!
These are a size 5 What are you, eight and a half?
Shut up!
- Come on!
- I'm pushing!
Push it!
Oh don't let me push you away!
- Is it in?
- Come on!
Push hard guy!
The heel went right through!
Oh my God it hurts so much!
- Oh now, I'm bleeding!
- Jen!
- Where are you Jen?
- It's Denholm!
What?
Hide the stress machine!
The stress machine?
What about the fire?
!
Ok!
Put the stress machine in Jen's room!
- He'll never go in there!
- But what if he does?
It doesn't matter!
He won't know what it is!
I can't go to prison Roy!
They'll rape the flip out of me!
You!
Stall him by the door!
I stall How?
I don't know!
Use your womanly ways!
Ok Moss!
Pass me that monitor screen.
The broken one.
There you are!
Hello there!
It's no use being womanly with me Jen!
You're in big trouble!
Nice screensaver!
Thank you.
A stress machine!
Just what we need!
Roll up your sleeves, Jen.
Let's get this over with.
It's a one way ticket to slammer town for us Roy.
With no return ticket!
I really am losing quite a lot of blood!

Do you feel stress now, Jen?
Jen!
Jen!
Jen!
Do you?
!
Evidently not.
Well done Jen!
You're not being fired by me at this precise moment.
I love the way the smoke seems to be coming off the top of it.
Just a second I'm late for golf!
I wonder why it didn't work "Made In Britain" I don't know if it's the loss of blood or the melting plastic from the monitor but I feel great!
It's so ironic but this entire situation has been quite stressful.
I'll get help You sent an e-mail about a fire?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Here we are!
Your place your place La maison de la femme El casa del signorita Das haus die Frau Good night!
I'll just walk you to the door.
- There's no need.
- That's okay.
So I guess this is "arrivederci".
I'd quite fancy a cup of tea though.
A glass of water maybe.
Perhaps a little lie down.
Look I have to tell you something.
What?
I wanted to tell you in the restaurant but it a good time never came up and I - I wasn't gonna say it but - Say it.
I have to.
What?
You've got shit on your head.
What?
There's some shit on your head.
What?
Where?
Where?
It's been there forever.
Oh God!
Oh God!
It's chocolate!
It's chocolate!
It's not shit!
It's not shit!
It's..
It's my dessert.
I don't know how it got there but uh It's on my fingers.
It's not shit!
Thank God for that!
You know, I just spent the last hour thinking you were some sort of disgusting tramp.
Oh no!
That's funny!
- Oh God look!
- What?
It's chocolate!
How about that cup of tea now?
I was a perfect gentleman last night from beginning to end but she can't see past a little bit of shit on my forehead!
I thought you said it was chocolate.
Yes, chocolate, yes!
I meant chocolate.
I forgot to turn this thing on.
Hello, IT Hi, uh, something's wrong with my computer.
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
Oh No!
No, oh Dear, thanks.
You're welcome then.
It's typical.
The one time I manage to bamboozle a girl in the building into going out with me and this happens.
She's gonna tell everyone!
Oh come on!
She's a receptionist, she'd hardly gossip.
Besides it's a boring story.
Yeah that's boring.
It's boring, she won't tell anyone.
Hello.
Sorry guys.
She might have told Jen.
No, that's what I'm saying.
It wasn't.
It was It was chocolate.
It was chocolate.
I don't know I don't know it it got on my fingers and then I must have Listen how did you even hear about this, mom?
Moss Moss, there's a spider in my office.
Could you deal with it?
I just hate spiders.
I'm not overly fond of them myself there, Jen.
How How big is Whoa!
Hey now!
I'll tell you what.
I actually recommend my good friend Roy there as the go-to guy on anything with more than 7 eyes.
He's on a very brief personal call right now.
Come, Moss.
Don't be silly.
You're right, I'm being silly.
Wrap it up, Roy!
It's just a spider.
It's fine.
Oh look!
It seems to have left of its own volition.
Oh, be a man, Moss!
You're right, I'll be a man.
I'm a man.
Please don't shut the door.
I won't.
Goodbye, Jen.
That was my mother.
How did she hear about this?
Oh, was that the woman who phoned earlier?
'Cause I've just been telling everybody.
Why would you want to go out with Patricia anyway?
I mean, her last boyfriend was Simon from 3rd.
- Jen!
- Hey, you!
Hello there.
Have you caught it yet?
Not quite, Jen.
The spider's managed to walk behind me.
And it's between me and the door.
So I can't get out.
Simon from 3rd is the one with the hair.
Oh, him!
Oh, he's awful.
He once ate a copy of Loaded for a bet.
- She liked him?
- Apparently.
That explains everything!
She likes the kind of big obnoxious guy who eats Loaders.
Hello, Daniel.
How are you?
I'm great, thanks.
How are you?
I'm great.
Well, can either of you tell me Okay Okay who wrote Missa Brevis in D minor?
Was it Mozart or Beethoven?
That was a certain Mr. Mozart, I think you'll find.
Oh right, do you know a lot about classical music?
- Petit pois.
- Oh, right.
Mozart, Beethoven, 50/50 ain't it?
Actually, no, you were right.
It was Mozart.
Well it's It was Okay, so, let's try another one.
Okay.
Here we go.
In what year did Mozart die?
- Was it 1780 or 1791?
- 1791.
Yes!
Yes!
Bang on!
Good!
God!
I hope he doesn't come in again!
- Jen!
- Yes!
Is Roy off the phone yet?
The spider is now upon my person.
You guys don't mind me chilling out in here, do you?
No.
Chill out!
So did you see the match last night?
- Oh yeah!
- Oh yeah!
- God!
- Did we?
What a match!
All of the players running up the pitch and running down it again.
Such athleticism!
What was Rooney thinking over there?
Who knows!
That's Rooney!
He is a foolish boy!
Yeah but that referee I'm sorry the referee is just an idiot.
Yes, he was certainly the villain of the piece.
Daniel, you're still here.
Yeah, just just having a little break.
Do you wanna come and join me?
Stop it!
Well, I'd better I'd better hit this way.
Oh by the way, guys, if you need any help with any more spiders, just give me a call, okay?
Yeah, we'll be fine, I think, thanks.
Actually, do you have a card?
That is good.
See you.
You like him!
Who?
Oh, that good looking man with "Security" written on his shoulders?
Yes!
Yes, I do.
He seems really nice.
Nice!
'Cause that's what you women want!
Nice guys!
Hello, IT!
.
What are you talking about, Roy?
If my date last night proved anything, it's that you, ladies, you don't want nice guys.
I think if your date proved anything, Roy, it's that women like men without poo on their foreheads.
That's our type.
That has nothing to do with this.
She clearly just didn't want a gentleman in her life.
I hate to generalize, you know that.
But all women just want bastards.
That women liking bastards thing is a total myth.
I've tried turning it off and on again and nothing happened.
Is it definitely plugged in?
Oh, let me have a look.
Oh, sorry, that's it, thanks very much.
You're welcome then.
It's just not true.
Women don't want gentlemen, they want bullies and thugs.
I'll prove it to you.
How will you prove it to me, Roy?
Oh!
Okay.
I'll put a I'll put on a classified ad online.
A classified?
Yeah, like a lonely hearts thing but I'll make it sound psychotic.
And I still bet I'll get a bezillion replies.
Oh, dear God.
Come on.
How much?
Okay.
Yeah, I'll give you 20 quid if you get 1 response.
You're on!
Oh my God, no!
It's all about body fluids with you, isn't it?
Come on, Moss!
We need to get to work.
Work?
Yeah, we need to post a classified lonely hearts ad online that makes me sound like a psycho so that I can prove to Jen that all women love bastards and therefore win 20 pounds.
Thank God!
I thought that thing was broken.
"Shut up!
Do what I tell you!
I'm not interested"!
These are just some of the things you'll be hearing if you answer this ad.
"I'm an idiot and I don't care about anyone but myself".
" No dogs".
- That's good.
- What's yours?
Mine doesn't look any good now.
Go on.
"I'm going to murder you".
"You bloody woman"!
Might want to play a bit hard to get.
If you were a murderer, what would your nickname be?
Mine would be "The Gardener", 'cause I'd always leave a rose at the scene of the crime.
What would your murder weapon be?
A hammer.
Hey, Moss.
"Would you like to go for dinner with me"?
"And then maybe back to my place"?
I'd love to, Jen, but I'm actually helping Roy at the moment.
No.
No, no, no.
Who does this remind you of, yeah?
"Do you wanna go on a date with me"?
Gandhi?
No, no, the other one.
Bono.
No, no, I was doing Roy.
Yes, yes, it's like there was 2 of me.
Come on.
Get your money ready.
20 pounds.
Hey!
Hello.
It's security.
I hope I'm not in any danger.
Oh my God!
It's not shit!
On my head, it's not shit!
It's chocolate spread.
- Taste it!
- No!
Look!
Look!
Ringo Starr?
I'll be wondering about that all night!
How do you know about this site?
I'm a member.
Really?
You do the whole lonely hearts thing?
I'm a 32-year-old IT man who works in a basement.
Yes, I do the whole lonely hearts thing.
So, as you can clearly see, it wasn't excrement, it was chocolate.
I was playing a joke.
It was chocolate.
Jen, it's okay, I've got it.
Don't worry about it.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
- I've got a response!
- That was quick!
Yeah, why is it taking so long to download?
Something happened with the router this morning.
We're back to pre-broadband speed.
Dear But we're on the phone now.
Why can't you just ask me now?
Can't Jen, trust me.
Why should I trust you?
Because I know what's good for you.
Listen, you have to be home between 8 and 9 tonight, are you gonna be home?
Okay, this sounds exciting.
It might not happen, okay?
But hopefully it will.
Now I don't know if this is exciting or not Jen Jen, it's exciting!
"would be very interested in meeting up and talking it over".
"Love, Rebecca".
Oh my God!
What did we write again?
It started with "shut up".
There's more.
"I attached a photograph for your approval "or not"!
Exclamation mark.
All right, let's have a look at you, you mad thing.
Nice hair so far.
- Eyebrows seem normal.
- Two eyes.
That's the best amount of eyes.
Nice eyes too.
It has to go around.
She must have a shite nose.
Do you remember the Internet at this speed?
Up all night and you'd see 8 women.
- Good nose.
- That is a good nose.
The mouth has to be wrong.
There's gotta be something wrong with her mouth.
Now that's a good looking woman.
Should I tell Jen we got a reply?
Roy?
Roy?
Roy!
Roy!
Hello, Daniel!
I mean, hello.
Jen?
Hello, it's Chris Tarrant from "Who Wants to be a Millionaire"?
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Chris Tarrant, hello!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Jen the next voice you hear is gonna be Daniel's - Daniel's, Ok.
- But before I put you on with him, he's asked me to ask you a question.
Okay, you can ask me a question.
Yeah, he wants to know if you'll go out for dinner with him tomorrow night.
Oh really?
Yes!
Yes, of course, I will!
Of course!
Oh yes!
Yes!
Yes, of course!
Yes, that's great, Jen.
Now let me fill you in on what's happening.
Daniel's doing very well although he has just used his 50/50.
Now, here's Daniel.
Daniel, you got 30 seconds.
Starting from now!
- Okay, Jen.
- Hi, Daniel.
Yeah, hi Jen, Jen, uh, okay who composed The Wooden Prince?
Was it A) Bartok, B) Chopin?
Did you see "I'm a Millionaire" last night?
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire"?
it's called.
No, I didn't.
Well, you are not going to Adam and beliEVE this.
Okay, do these make me look like a bastard?
Why do you wanna look like a bastard?
I've got that date tonight, she's expecting a monster.
Do these me make look like a bastard?
They make you look like an idiot.
- Anyway, did you see it?
- What?
"Do you want to be a Millionaire"?
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire"?
"Who wants to be a person who is wrong"?
What's happened?
- If I may - Sure.
Guess who was on it last night!
- You!
- No, Daniel.
- King of men.
- Daniel was on "Millionaire"?
Indeed he was, sir.
And it was the "Do you want to phone a friend" - It's just "Phone a friend".
- Anyway.
She was the "phone a friend"?
- She was the "phone a friend".
- You're the "phone a friend"!
What was the subject?
Classical music is the extraordinary answer to that question.
So who of course is Daniel, our estimed temp security guard, going to phone but Jonathan Miller over here.
Think Daniel was on Millionaire.
Too bad it wasn't 50/50.
It was.
- And?
- I got it wrong.
I cost 31,000 pounds.
It isn't funny though.
Now I have to go on a date with him.
Wow!
The rules on that show have really changed!
No, you don't understand.
He asked me out on the show before I got the question wrong.
It was all very romantic.
But now I don't think he likes me now.
And I don't wanna go out with the biggest loser in England There you are!
Daniel - Hello.
- Hi.
- Gonna go for this meal then.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I can't wait.
I'm gonna take you to one of my favourite restaurants.
Right.
I'll pay.
- It really is the least I can do.
- Oh yeah Oh my God!
Did you see that look?
I have a dinner date with that man.
If I'm not here tomorrow, I want you to call the police.
Maybe not the best time to mention it, but also you owe me 20 quids.
What?
You got a response?
With the one that ended: "No dogs"?
Yep.
Oh my God, brilliant!
More money gone!
Now the money that Daniel lost wasn't really yours, was it?
It would have been if I'd married him, Moss.
I need a good restaurant.
Maybe if he likes the food, he won't beat me to death with a shoe.
I thought you said you'd take him to one of your favourite restaurants.
Haven't you got it yet?
That's what I do: I lie I lie and I lie and I lie!
Well, I went to a good place recently.
Nice atmosphere.
Food's great.
- Really?
- Yes.
Why?
Sorry, I just didn't have you down as a restaurant person.
I'm a restaurant person.
Why wouldn't I be a restaurant person?
Cheese string?
No, thanks.
What's this place called?
Messijoes.
- Is that French?
- French?
No, it's English.
Okay, thank you, Moss.
Yeah, I'll uh I'll give that a go.
Okay, I need a place to bring this girl that says: "I'm a bastard".
Well, I went to a good place recently.
Nice atmosphere.
Food's great.
It's got a bit of an edge.
Yeah?
What's it called?
Messijoes.
What is that?
Spanish?
No!
Spanish?
It's English.
Messijoes.
Okey dokey, you get the firecracker nachos.
And you are getting the prawn bites with spicy salsa.
This seems an unusual place for someone like you to want to meet.
Yeah but everyone needs a place to come to be alone.
Look at me!
Yeah!
Look at me!
Get a clown over here, please!
You're a loner?
I'm a loner all right.
I'm just a lonely loner on a lonely road.
Alone.
Do you always wear shades?
Always.
They help me hide the fact I'm always lying to women.
Everyone is having having fun, fun, fun.
'Cause everything is nice and everyone is friendly.
Lots of friendly faces having fun, fun, fun.
'Cause everything is nice and everyone is friendly.
- Smile and the world will - Excuse me!
Excuse me!
It's just It's not Sorry, it's just not appropriate at the moment.
You're that bloke off the telly!
And you must be the woman he phoned!
Brilliant!
Funniest thing I've seen in ages.
God!
I'm a bastard!
Yes.
So you keep saying.
Trouble It's basically what I am.
Thank you.
You know something?
I don't think you're a bastard at all.
I am so.
I am a complete tool.
Oh my God!
No don't, don't!
Don't hit him!
I know her.
Hey!
What's going on?
Stay out of this, Fonzy!
You're fighting in front of kids!
I don't care!
You're a brute!
This bloke just insulted me!
Hey!
Bit more careful with the clown shoe there, Mister.
Just hold your head back.
Oh God!
He caught me by surprise.
When I see him tomorrow - That was his last day.
- Thank God!
Oh my God, look!
If you're coming, can you just bloody hurry up!
- I'm coming!
I - God's sake!
I just need to take my shoes off.
They look like such fruits.
- I'll call you a cab.
- No, no, no, it's fine.
- Taxi!
- I'll get my bus.
Don't be stupid, it's cold.
Taxi!
- Here.
- Oh God.
Here you can have your 20 back.
I don't really think the bet proved anything.
Taxi!
Thanks, Roy.
- I just want - Nice date!
Just a lonely loner walking a lonely road.
Hi, girls.
My name is Maurice Moss.
Or Moss for short.
Sorry about the sound quality but I'm having to do this in the toilet of my mom's house.
She's watching Diagnosis Murder at full volume.
And it drives me up the wall.
Don't worry, though.
I'm sitting on the toilet but I'm not using it.
What?
- Moss?
- Yes?
What you doing in there?
Number 2s, leave me alone!
Don't forget to flush the toilet.
Don't clog it up like you usually do.
I know!
Just stop doing this!
You're always doing this!
You're making it going back in!
Now, my type

Transcript : Sixe, Anyone.
Suggestions, critics & insults ;) The Red Door.
"We don't need no education"!
Yes you do.
You've just used the double negative.
Notice anything?
- What?
- Yes.
Your eyes, something's wrong with your eyes.
No I have a new cup.
What's wrong with my eyes?
It's not very distinctive, is it?
How's anyone supposed to know it's yours?
There's a picture of me on it.
No, there isn't!
- Yes there is.
- No there isn't!
- Moss!
- Yes there is.
I'm sick of my things going walk about.
With this picture, everyone knows that a certain Mr. Moss might be looking for his cup There is nothing on the cup!
Wrangle with him and you'll find your handful my friend.
Wrangle!
With who?
There's no one there!
- Morning.
- Morning.
Did you have a nice week-end?
- It was alright, thanks.
- Not you!
I did too.
Nice scarf.
- I'm not wearing a scarf.
- Not you, Moss!
Notice anything new about Moss?
His eyes?
What is wrong with my eyes?
No, he has a new cup.
It's the talk of the office.
Yes, I think I read about it in Hits.
Receptionist 3rd floor, Gloria what's-her-name Have you seen her baby?
I didn't even know she was pregnant.
She was onto here!
Yeah, I thought she was stealing office equipment.
- What?
- Ask me where it is - Where what is?
- The picture.
Where is the picture, Moss?
It's on the base, Roy.
OK, well, let's see it then!
Sure, I pour hot water all over myself, and we all have a good chuckle.
Everyone except muggins here.
Show you in a minute.
Can I ask you two a question?
Please, Christ, yes!
Wait, wait.
One moment, wait.
Ok.
Go.
How can you two live like this?
- How can you two - Don't google the question Moss!
What are you talking about?
It's so disgusting in here.
I mean I know nobody comes down here, but it doesn't mean you have to live like animals, you know I mean for a start you could clean that window and you'd have a bit of light in here.
What window?
That one up there.
Yeah, that's not a window.
Yes it is.
Get it clean, you'll have some light in here.
I think that we have plenty of light light to be doing fine!
I mean look at that CD tray.
Isn't that important, when you'd like to actually put CDs in there at some point?
Well, yes, ideally, but I haven't the heart to move them.
I mean, how did that even happen?
Ok.
Now, I'm curious.
Give us a look at the picture then.
What picture?
The picture on the cup.
Right!
Behold!
There's nothing there!
What?
!
This isn't my cup!
What is that?
Goat's cheese salad?
You don't like goat's cheese?
I don't like goat's anything!
I don't like goats being involved in any stage of the food production process.
Would I blow everyone's mind if I ate dessert first?
What are you eating anyway?
It's a bucket of fried chicken.
You know, it comes in a real bucket now.
Tell me, what's behind that red door?
Nothing.
Well, there must be something behind it.
There's nothing behind the red door, Jen.
- Well then I can just go - No Jen!
It's just a boring old store room, that's all.
It's just a store room where we keep the snibbits.
What's a snibbit?
It's a kind of planch.
A planch for the computers?
Yes.
Computer planch.
Well, if it's a store room, - you can store some of this stuff.
- No!
Jen, Jen!
Look, I know that you wanna make your mark down here and, and that's really sweet, but, you can't just go messing around with the snibbits door room, willy-nilly.
You You can't upset the whole harmony of the place.
Harmony!
What harmony?
Look, I know that the place looks like a bit of a mess, but it's actually a very delicate ecosystem.
Everything is connected.
It's like the rainforest.
You change one thing, even the tiniest bit, and the whole rainforest dies.
You don't want the rainforest to die, do you?
No, I really don't want the rainforest to die.
That's what will happen if you open the red door.
Hello, I.T., have you tried turning it off and on again?
Ok, but are you sure that it's plugged in?
Ok, well I'll be up in a minute.
What was that about?
Just a girl on four.
Oh, a job?
You gonna go?
Yeah.
In a while.
It can wait.
But why can it wait?
She probably needs to get on, she needs her computer, you know.
Yeah well, I am reading a comic.
I knew it.
Every time I used to phone I.T. in my last job it's a good couple of hours before someone got to me.
That is how we do it.
You can't go up straight away or they'll all expect it.
You're killing the rainforest!
Stop saying that!
Look there's more than that: me and this girl, I asked her out once, she said no, it all got a little bit embarrassing and ever since then, whenever I go up, she treats me like I'm some sort of sexually frustrated cretin.
Get up there now, please.
You're not the head of this department.
No, I'm relationship manager.
I'm the one you gets the complaints.
I'm the one who gets in trouble.
I'm the one whose name is on the line Oh God!
All right, I will go up just to shut you up.
Watch her!
For God's sake!
There's someone under here.
Yes!
Hello!
Hello?
Did you get it fixed?
Oh, yeah.
Well, left him to it.
- Just can't have him in sight.
- Yeah.
Do what you need and just go.
What are you laughing at?
This flipping circuit board, Jen, Some chump has run the data line right through the power supply.
Amateur hour!
I've got tears in my eyes.
Roy's stuck under a desk.
Stuck under a desk?
!
Yes.
It is an unusual text, isn't it?
It's not just me?
No, it's unusual.
I'd best investigate.
Yes.
You investigate.
I'll hold the fort.
Listen, I'm really sorry about your hand.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I must have cut it when I swooned.
I startled you a bit.
I didn't know there were anyone else down here.
I thought it was just the three of us.
I often work at nights so, perhaps that's why you haven't seen me.
Gosh, it's very cold in here, isn't it?
Air conditioning.
Keep these things cool.
Yes, what are they?
I've no idea.
They have put me in charge of them.
Moss and Roy.
I don't know their names.
I mean, I don't know any of these stuff even does.
What's going on there?
I don't know.
Is it good that it's doing that?
Usually, it doesn't do that.
And I think I should tell them, but, but often I just look away.
And this one: Flash.
Flash.
Flash.
Then wait for it.
Nothing for a while.
Here it comes.
Double flash.
Brilliant.
It's obvious you are going mad.
So, let me get this straight.
You stay down here all the time.
I pop out occasionally when I have to get supplies.
And you don't know why you're here, or what you do.
Correct.
So this is your job?
This is what you want for a career?
No.
You don't understand.
I'm not here because I want to be here.
This is This is my punishment.
You see, I used to be Denholm's second in command.
Do I amaze you?
So, how did you end up down here?
That's the question I've been asking myself for 4 long years.
Oh I couldn't help noticing that you're bleeding.
- Yes.
No it's fine it - Just let me - Please I can help.
- I'll deal with myself at home but the risk is, honestly.
Oh my Oh my God.
Please, excuse, excuse me, what are you doi Get off me!
Get Thank you.
That should clear up nicely.
Yes, there was a time when things were very different.
I was one of Reynholm Industries' top guys.
You should have seen me, I was magical.
Here's me saying some pretty important stuff to a group of people circled around me.
In a boardroom, I was a wizard.
A punchy character.
Here's me with a graph.
Things were moving fast.
So fast, my career was advancing by leaps and bounds.
Adam saw greater things for me.
They were crazy heady days.
It seemed like these days would last forever.
But it all changed.
So, what happened?
It's quite a long story actually.
Really?
Don't worry about it then.
Oh my good gracious me, look at that!
Quick!
What is it?
I can't explain it.
You're just going to have to come over here, and look out this window for a while.
Whatever it is, we're not interested.
Well.
I have to say you're missing out.
Fine.
Jiminy!
Jones!
Look, the nature of the things that is happening has changed slightly, rendering it yet more interesting.
Someday, I will tell my kids about this.
But you can't even tell us How are you gonna tell your children?
Oh, you have no interest in the world.
Are you sure it's okay to come out?
Yeah, don't you worry about those two.
And listen Richmond, I've always wanted to know yeah, why do you never see any Cockney Goths?
They're too cheerful.
They'd spoil it for the rest of us.
And how come you never see Goths driving cars?
We drive cars We're just like you really except that we listen to Cradle of Filth.
Cradle of Filth, I presume that's a band.
It's not literally a cradle of filth?
Oh no.
That would be horrible.
Cradle of Filth are actually one the best contemporary dark-wave bands in the world.
I'll never forget the first time I heard them.
Changed my life.
Blew my mind.
I was lucky I discovered them when I did!
Because it was around that time that things started to go wrong for me at work.
I don't know what happened.
Suddenly, people just weren't returning my calls.
In my strategy meetings, they'd seemed distracted.
Distant.
I couldn't put my finger on it but something was wrong.
I'll tell you.
It was good to have the Filth to come home to after another disappointing day.
You've got to help Roy!
Richmond's out of his room.
He's not in his room, he's supposed to be in his room.
Why is he out of his room?
Well, he's gotta come out and play with us for a while.
But the rainforest and What's wrong with you Moss?
Roy's stuck underneath a lady's desk.
What!
Still?
!
Look, I know that normally this would be very funny but he's been under there too long for reasonable explanation.
That woman looks down, she's going to assume he's a desk rabbit.
- What's a desk rabbit?
- I just made that up.
But that's probably going to be what they'll sort of call people like Roy.
But Roy is not a desk rabbit, he's my best friend.
Unless you do something so tumble you, me and Tim Burton over there.
What can I possibly do?
I Look, she could look under there any minute.
- It could already be too late.
- I don't know what to do You're relationship manager, that falls under relationship.
Alright, alright.
Just shut you up.
Hello Richmond.
How are things?
Oh you know.
Not brilliant.
He's supposed to be in his room.
There's a builder outside, taking off his shirt.
- Like in ads?
- Yeah, like in ads - Easy one downstairs?
- They're fine, yeah.
I left Moss and Richmond in charge.
Good, well Moss Richmond!
He's not out of his room, is he?
Yeah.
What did I say about the red door?
I said don't open the red door!
It was the only thing that I asked you!
What have you got against him?
Just don't like him.
Oh God, you're just like the rest of them, the people that turn their backs on him as soon as he became a Goth.
He obviously hasn't told you about the funeral.
I think that you should ask him about the funeral.
Hello Denholm.
Hi Jen.
I'm just enjoying this cup of tea.
Brilliant!
How you doing Jen?
Yeah.
Just to say I met Richmond.
I see.
It's not for me to say Denholm, but it sounds like you two had a good relationship at one point.
You should speak to him.
I'll thank you to keep out of this Jen.
- Goths are people to.
- Enough!
There's absolutely no point to anything.
You're right, no point, it's all futile, can't even find my cup.
Try to look on the bright side.
Ah!
The bright side!
Sometimes, you just think what would actually change if I just killed myself.
You're right.
I could just kill myself.
And it'd be so easy, wouldn't it?
So very, very easy.
Richmond!
Get back to your room!
What's the point of sending him back to him room, what's the point of anything?
Come on, get brush!
Come on!
But she said I could come out.
Well you can't come out.
You're bringing everyone down.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, he is!
- Come on!
- Thank you.
Okay well then, tell her, why they sent you down here.
Tell her what you did.
I didn't do anything, I don't know why I'm down here.
So Denholm just amorted you for nothing, did he?
No, he changed.
After his father died.
I don't think he ever fully recovered.
From the moment I saw him at the funeral, I could tell there was something different.
Bloody good of you to come, thanks.
Thanks.
Bloody good service, wasn't it?
Yeah?
- Thank you.
- Watch your bloody hand!
I'm so sorry.
Here.
It's Cradle of Filth.
It got me through some pretty bleak times.
Try track 4, Coffin Fodder.
It sounds horrible, but it's actually quite beautiful.
Relationship manager.
Yes.
Yes of course.
First thing tomorrow.
That was Denholm.
He wants to see you.
What is it?
!
I can't believe you want me back.
You've got Jen to thank for that.
Her words the other day, moved me deeply.
Very deeply indeed.
Really?
What did she say?
Like I remember!
Point is: it's the effect of her words that's important.
I now know that treating someone differently just because of the colour of their skin is wrong.
I don't see why things can't get back to the way they were.
I just don't know what to say.
You're back with the big guys Richmond!
Great!
That's if you're prepared to take me on again.
You know how demanding I am.
Stop it.
You know how changeable I can be.
Yes Mr. Denholm.
Call me Denholm!
All right, thanks Denholm.
No no.
I don't like that.
Don't do it again.
All right, sorry.
In fact, I've changed my mind about the whole thing.
What?
You mean I have to stay down here?
Yes!
And leave me alone you goblin!
Oh well.
I suppose it's not quite so bad now that I don't have to stay in that room.
Yes, yes.
Well, we're happy to have you.
My milky lens has popped out.
Don't step on it.
You've got to help me find it.
Oh, actually, I think it's just popped round the back.
It does that sometimes.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on fellow.
Come on.
There.
How about that then?
That looks great!
Told you it was a window.
Bloody lens.
I'd really ought to Actually, I'm gonna Thank God.
At least, everything is back to normal.
As long as no one goes through that door.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
OK.
Here we go.
Sit properly?
Cheers.
Bill?
Mick Hucknall.
Hey, this is fun.
- It's been a good night so far.
- Yes, it's been really good, yeah.
Yeah, I'll be honest, when Julie suggested we get together, I was like "No".
You know, I get set up a lot by friends, and it never works out.
Tell me about it.
Me too.
You know, I hate dates usually.
They should call dates "Spend some time with a big fat loser"!
But this has been brilliant.
Hey I was thinking, afterwards, maybe you'd like to come back to my place?
We could listen to the new Jamie Cullum album.
Maybe, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, that'd be really nice actually.
Great.
Let me guess You're a red wine person?
Yes, yes I am!
I would be too, if we could get some service round here!
Yeah, you, Hucknall.
When you, when you Simply Ready?
Unbelievable.
Oh, I should say, um, I don't really like sharing.
So you get what you want, I'll get what I want we leave it at that.
I just think it's a lot less confusing.
Sure, sure.
- Did you say Jamie Cullum?
- Yeah.
I hate Jamie Cullum.
Oh, and, just to say, "I don't really like sharing".
With the rising inflection and everything.
In a tapas restaurant, he doesn't like sharing.
What the heck is tapas?
You know, tapas, - tiny food from Spain.
- Oh, yes.
- Teipas.
- Yeah, that's no how you say it.
Yes it is.
You're a teipas.
What else?
What else?
What else?
Oh God, you should have seen him with the waiters.
- Rude?
- Unbelievable!
Oh yeah, I used to work as a waiter.
If anyone was ever rude to me, I used to carry their food around in my trousers.
Oh my God!
Before you brought it to their table?
No, after.
Of course before!
Why would I do it after?
Do you think they did that to him?
Okay, well.
While he was eating, did you ear anyone laughing?
Like in the kitchen area.
Yes!
Yes I did, actually, yes I did.
That'll be trouser food.
- Oh God!
- Yeah.
Probably a good thing you weren't sharing.
My God!
I could have saved you the trouble.
That guy is famous, he's a mouth.
They call him "The News" because he was always talking about who he slept with.
I would honestly rather sleep with a rat.
Literally.
The thing I cannot understand yet, this: this is a man Julie on 5th thinks is perfect for me, I mean what was she thinking?
Wait a second.
- Who do you know on 5th?
- Why?
What was the name, was it Judy or Julie?
Why do you need to know?
No reason.
Lots of nice looking girls on fifth.
Looking for an in, aren't we?
An in?
No!

I know it's terrible, but, thank God, we weren't sharing.
I just can't get over it.
Yeah, well, we all have to go sometime.
It's terrible, it's just terrible!
It's bloody awful!
She was so beautiful!
She was some piece of ass.
Anyhow, can't mourn all the ruddy day, so You know I was the last person to sleep with her.
- Really?
She said that - What?
She said she was looking forward to sleeping with you.

Doesn't he realise that lying can lead to very serious ramifications?
Hello?

Someone to see you!
This man says you should take his card.
The girl from I.T., that's terrible.
I know, terrible, terrible thing.
You know, I was actually the last person to sleep with her.
Very sudden, yes.
I heard it was some bad tapas.
Teipas.
Yes.
You must be stunned.
I'm flabbergasted.
Well, you know where we are if you need us.
Sure, I'll be fine, thanks.
Just sort of stay away from this whole area, while we come to terms with the loss.
Leave me now, I would be alone.
Good lech?

MIO  Judy, the battery of my phone is - Look at this.

How nice is this?
I just got a big load of flowers, and a big card!
And everyone has signed it!
"You will always be in our heart"!
My God!
And you said they weren't nice here!
Yeah.
I don't understand why they've done this?
Why?
I'll tell for why.
It's because everyone thinks you're brilliant!
- Really?
- Yeah!
And in fact, everyone thinks you're so brilliant, they've just made you Employee of the Month.
- No?
- Yes!
- No?
- Yes!
- No!
- Yaha!
I don't believe it!
- Please believe it.
- Oh my God!
I didn't even know they had Employee of the Month here.
No, they brought it in just for you.
I'm gonna go up and thank everybody right now.
No!
Don't do that!
What?
Why not?
They'll be embarrassed.
It's embarrassing being thanked.
Don't be silly.
Events seem to be taking a downward turn.
I told you, stop calling me at work!
Nice and beautiful Jen!
Hello, Small Pall!
Didn't Are you I thought you were sick or something.
Sick?
Me?
No!
I couldn't be better, I've just won Employee of the Month.
So, um, you're going my way?
Don't you dare going too fast, no!
Just hard to get your head round, you know?
One minute, she's there and next minute just gone.
You know, I was the last person that slept with her actually.
She held on so tightly, you know, it was like scary, but, sexy scary, you know, just like Jen?
!
It was her!
What are you still doing here Bill, for God sake, go home!
He was the last person to sleep with her.
I know Apparently, she was pretty hard stuff!
Bye, Small Paul!
Bye Jen, see you.
Oh dear, oh Lord!
At this dreadful hour we're all reminded how brief our time is here on Earth.
Sorry, who is it who died?
I don't know.
I believe Mr. Renholm has a few words.
There's one more angel in Heaven.
God, I miss Jen!
She reminded me of me, at her age.
I mean, when I was her age, she reminded me of her age.
She reminded me of my age at her age.
When I was her age, she was reminded of me?
I truly liked Jen.
And that en-likening of her became a friendship.
A friendship which ended so suddenly, just twelve hours ago After what I gather, was a rather sensational evening with Bill Crouse!
Bill, you dog!
Where is he?
Still cleaning himself off.
She was special.
So special in fact, that when I called my close personal friend Elton John and told him about her, he dropped everything, and offered to come here and perform for us!
You heard me, he's in the building!
Elton John is going to sing a beautiful song about death.
Oh my God, this is so so lovely.
Thank you, so, so much!
Tank you, thank you, oh God!
Could I, say a few words?
Oh my God!
Thank you, so, so much!
I would I would not be standing up here today if it wasn't for so many things but, not least, - Without him - Hey, she isn't dead!
Yeah!
You lying cow!
We want Elton!
We want Elton!
We want Elton!
We want Elton!
Okay!
If that Judy woman comes down, I don't work here, you've never seen me, just make up something, just get rid of her!
She's easy to spot, she's has three rows of teeth.
Listen, if I needed to get out of the country, very, very cheaply, how would I go about doing that?
Hey you!
What did you say about me?
Hello there, Jen!
I would love to stay and chat, but, I've just received a telephone call, saying that my father has just killed someone.
I need to attend to.
Did you tell everyone I was dead?
Maybe?
Because, um, they all thought I was dead.
- I know something.
- What?
What do you know?
Bill Crouse, he's saying he slept with you last night.
He's saying what?
He think you're dead, so he's telling everybody you slept with him.
He's the one you should be angry at!
Not me!
I'm insignificant!
Bastard!
Voicemail!
Hey!
It's Jen!
Stop telling everyone I slept with you!
You bastard!
Must have gone home.
Oh God, my throat hurts.
Well, it's probably all that shouting.
I'm talking, aren't I?
Can you get me his address?
Yes, it might be a bit difficult.
I have to hack into his private company account, it might take some time.
There we go.
Oh, I really don't feel very well.
Well, you look terrible.
I'm still talking, aren't I?
You have one new message.
Hey!
It's Jen!
Stop telling people I slept with you!
You bastard!
Where Roy?
Roy is dead!
No, no!
Don't breakdown!
Don't break down, you bitch!
Oh my God, oh my God!
Bloody hell!
Why you do that to me when I need this chance?
Oh for God's sake!
Now my car is bloody open and I don't know what it means!
Come on, come on Ritchley Street, Ritchley Street.
My God, okay, I'm Right.
Probably guys, probably guys, leaving message, funny message, probably, Bob, it's Bob leaving funny messages.
And the, the floating head.
It's all stress, a bit stress is all and just fun and games.
Oh God!
Oh God!
Let me in!
Let me in Bill!
No!
It's raining!
Please, let me in!
No, you're never coming in!
Stop telling people I slept with you!
I will!
I will!
I'm sorry!
Bastard!
You bastard!
Oh no!
I'm sorry!
You bastard!
Small Paul, you're gone now.
You pushed that trolley a little too hard, You felt a twinge, it was your heart and you're dead now And now you're running four feet in heaven - Did you know him?
- No.
I don't think that's Elton John.

Transcript : Anyone, Sixe.
Suggestions, critics & insults ;) 1x06 Aunt Irma Visits I know you won a party!
But I have to say thank you to a few people after what has been a momentous week for this company.
Project Iccarus has increased our productivity 10 folds.
Every department is working at three times usual speed due to the increased interconnectivity of our computer system!
Computers!
Computers!
How could I talk about all that computer stuff, all of that computer gobbledegook, without saying a word about the lawyers!
They cut the red tape!
They cut the red tape!
They cut the red tape!
- Come on!
- Yes!
That's enough!
And when you're talking about computers, how can you fail to mention Accounts!
He's building up to us!
He must be!
And finally, last but not least Champagne These three people proved, time and again, that they have the right stuff!
The toilet cleaners!
They said we couldn't do it!
They said outsourcing our toilet cleaning would be inefficient!
Derk, Banhead and Doodles proved them wrong!
Toilets!
That's right Doodles!
Where are you going?
They do this every time.
They never remember us!
But you did the work!
Of course we're not going to the "thank you" party!
Why would we go?
We weren't thanked!
Hello?
I.T., have you tried turning it off and on again?
Have you tried sticking it up your arse?
I just realised that was my mother.
God!
I was really looking forward to that, you know.
Fancy to dance.
I'm glad the toilet guys got the note, though.
They do good work.
Have you been to the toilets on 12th?
It's like going on holiday!
I now try not to go at home, now.
I save it up!
Oh Jesus!
Will you please do something about that poster?
What poster?
Bloody drawer!
That one!
The one with the monkey!
It's horrible!
The monkey?
What's wrong with that monkey?
He's not horrible, he's lovely!
He's a lovely little monkey!
What's he doing!
A goal!
Not that monkey!
That monkey Oh right.
That is a bit frightening!
Anyway!
I'd better fix this drawer.
Moss!
Do you have the hammer?
You're not listening to me!
I hate it when people don't listen to me!
- Oh God!
- Hey, that much!
Hyena screeching!
It's like someone's killing a cat in here!
Some kind of shouty cat!
- What's going on?
- God!
Bring it down!
Just bring it down.
I'm so, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm just I'm just a little bit You know - You know - What?

Well, they do have some strong arguments.
"Carrie", Moss, first scene in "Carrie".
Yeah.
You know, I People tell me I'm not great during this time, so I felt I should warn you.
Right.
"Not great" what way?
Just I'm really not great to be around, so - try not to get on my nerves.
- Oh yeah.
Hey, I've had a few girlfriends.
I'm not completely oblivious!
- You won't even know I'm here.

With their ways Their mysterious seasons!
The moon!
Glenn Close!
Sheila Riston!
All the different kinds of women.
Smashing!
Oh my appointment.
I've got to go and see the psychiatrist.
I can't believe there's a psychiatrist in the building.
All because those two from accounts just had enough of everything and wanted to go to the seaside.
The seaside?
They committed suicide, Roy!
That's right!
Yes, of course.
Why do you have to go and see her?
Because I said Jen was dead, that time.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
That'll be it.
She said it was something only a severely disturbed person would do.
And that now, I have to spend a lot of time in therapy.
Isn't that great?
Oh well, yes, that's That's clearly terrific.
No!
No, that's bad!
Why do you think that's great?
The psychiatrist is a very attractive lady?
- I see She's of the female - Genre?
Yes.
A Dr. Melfi to your Tony Soprano?
She's a glamorous old woman.
Oh, the things you could learn from her Or from any woman.
Is Jen is her office?
- I need to get her to sign something.
- Yeah.
Don't get on her nerves.
How would I get on her nerves?
Hello!
Shouldn't I be on the couch?
No, Maurice.
Not today.
I've got some good news.
I think you've downed the corner.
I'm not going on the couch?
You don't need me any more, Moss.
What?
Well, there's obviously nothing wrong with you.
And I think you're ready now to do without our sessions.
But I've been feeling depressed!
Oh really?
Why?
Because I'm pregnant.
What?
I mean I had a dream that I was pregnant.
Well There's nothing unusual about that.
But when I have the baby, I looked down and saw that it was my father!
- That's normal, Moss.
- Really?
That's the maddest thing I could think of!
My mother?
What if it had two heads?
Moss!
Listen, I think you're fine and there are other people here who need me more.
But I've been having dark thoughts.
Dark thoughts?
Yes.
Thoughts about dark things What sort of dark things?
Things that are dark Like what?
Darkness night Things of the night Dracula You haven't been thinking about self-harm?
Self-harm, yes!
Harm!
Harm with the self.
Suicide For starters, yes.
Moss, I do not think that you are suicidal.
Why?
Why not?
I tell you, I'm at the end of my flipping tether!
Moss!
It's not like you to use that sort of language!
- Flip off!
- Moss!
For God's sake!
- Yes!
- Roy!
Sorry Roy!
I may be speaking louder at the moment because I'm wearing ear-plugs.
Why are you wearing ear-plugs?
That's right!
- What?
- What's this contraption?
I'm I'm stealing food from this machine.
- Yeah!
- You know I do!
Oh, by the way, Roy, your work on Project Iccarus was very good.
Well done, you did a great job!
Thanks!
Yep?
I can't hear you!
What's wrong with you?
Oh my God, you're crying?
I'm not crying!
You're crying!
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong!
I'm fine!
Will you stop getting at me?
You're always getting at me!
I'm not getting at you!
Stop shouting at me!
Why are these things always so hard to open?
!
Oh my God!
Wow, calm down, everybody!
What on Earth is going on?
!
I don't know, I feel weird.
I've I've been swearing like a flipping docker!
Denholm's just thanked me for Project Iccarus and I started crying like an actress!
What's going on?
!
Maybe it's all this stuff that you both eat.
- Oh will you get off that?
- No, honestly, it's true!
Okay, Moss, what did you have for breakfast this morning?
- Smarties cereals.
- Oh my God!
I didn't even know Smarties made a cereal.
They don't.
It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk.
Case closed!
It's too much sugar, that's all!
No no!
Hold on now!
I basically live on sugar and we've never had these problems before.
The only other explanation is No, no.
It's silly.
What?
Well I feel ridiculous even saying it but Where I worked before, there was me and a few other girls, Liz and Susan and whenever Aunt Irma was visiting me, we all kind of synchronized.
What's that got to do with us?
Well - You think - Well maybe - You're not saying - I know it sounds crazy.
Wow!
You don't think that Aunt Irma is visiting us?
The symptoms, Roy!
I am a man!
He's a man!
We're men!
Okay, okay!
Tell me how you're feeling?
I feel delicate.
And annoyed And I think I'm ugly.
That's her!
This is ridiculous!
I've never heard anything so bizarre in my life!
Oh stop shouting at her!
You're always shouting at her and it's not fair!
It's not fair!
You don't believe this theory, do you?
- No!
- No.
- It's non sense, isn't it?
- She's so silly!
- Sugar!
- Yeah What?
That's not what's causing it.
You think it's Irma?
Yes.
Don't you?
No!
I'm a man!
We're men!
Well, if it's true, it's the scientific breakthrough of the afternoon.
It's not true!
Don't worry, I wasn't about to look foolish by jumping to conclusions, so I've sent an e-mail out asking everyone's opinions.
Right.
Well, that's a good idea.
No, sorry.
Could you run that part to me again?
I've sent it to everyone in my address book.
You should have one.
What?
Do we have PMT?
You sent this out?
!
Oh you signed it from both of us!
You signed it from both of us!
Yes.
Along with a list of symptoms.
"Headachy", "Weakened", "Irritability, anxiety"!
"Breast tenderness"!
I get that, don't you?
Yes!
But you cannot tell the entire I.T. community that we have PMT!
Come on!
No one would use that sort of information against us.
Now, wait a second!
They would, wouldn't they?
Oh no!
There's probably a whole website devoted to us already!
Oh I only posted it about an hour ago.
Google our names!
Oh no!
What do we gotta do?
I don't know!
Come on!
It's my turn with the bottle.
God, sorry Richmond, sorry.
I always forget you work here.
Yeah.
I seldom normally come out this far, only could you have a word with Moss and Roy?
Ever since they got famous, they've been at each other's throats.
- Famous?
- Yes.
Google their names.
Oh my God!
How many entries do they have?
Thousands Mosse's e-mail's spreading like a virus!
You've unleashed a monster with that aunt Irma business.
Yes Richmond.
Tell me, how come Aunt Irma isn't affecting you?
Of course it is!
I've been feeling very gloomy all day!
Not my usual cheery self at all!
Yeah.
I guess it's just difficult to tell underneath all that make-up.
I'm not wearing make-up!
Could you have a word?
They're driving me out of my tiny little mind.
Guys!
You gonna have to Oh my goodness!
What happened to your face?
We had an argument.
Oh God, have you seen this?
What's happening?
The rioting has been going on all night.
The men involved are young, angry and almost all of them work with computers.
This is insane!
What's going on?
!
In Tokyo, two games designers went on the rampage in a shopping centre and frightened a dog!
In Hamburg, a group of software developers shouted at a bus.
The situation is completely out of cont And it's all because of Aunt Irma.
But how?
You shouldn't have sent out this e-mail detailing the symptoms.
You know how suggestible and easily swayed I.T. people are - That's not true!
- Yes it is!
No you're right.
Of course it is.
You shouldn't have sent that e-mail, Moss!
Oh don't blame me!
- It's your fault!
- Guys!
Guys, come on!
You're fighting!
It's like you're in a trance!
No, you're right!
We shouldn't be doing this!
This is enough!
We never fight!
We have to do something.
Yeah, whatever.
I'm going in.
Damn it Roy!
I never thought it would come to this!
The hell it has!
She's the only one that's had direct contact with Irma.
If we can just calm her down then We can hope and pray that everybody else calms down too.
You've got big balls, Roy!
Thanks.
You're very welcome.
Hiya!
Can't even find a bloody pen in here!
How is my soldier?
What do you want?
!
I just came in for a little chat.
You are looking good today!
- Ah, thank you.
- So slim!
Yeah, I'm trying to stay in shape, you know Oh your hair looks great!
Yeah.
Hair conditioner.
The action on this is great!
Hello!
Hello Maurice.
I have to tell you I've a little confession to make.
As you may or may not know, for ethical reasons, I'm required not to have any relations with any of my patients.
But for the last few months, I've been developing some warm feelings towards you.
And the real reason I terminated your therapy was so that I could explore some of these feelings I see Jen, I was just wondering, when you were working in your old job, with the girls, if things ever got on top of you, what would you do to relax?
We'd have a big girls' night out.
I'd love that actually.
A big girly night out!
There aren't chances of that round here.
Not necessarily.
Mom?
!
This is my psychiatrist.
Oh!
No.
No, I'm I'm sorry.
It's just that you You look exactly like my mother.
No, no!
But that that don't be offended by that.
She's she's a very sexy woman.
Not not not that I would want to have sex with her I know that that's what you psychiatrists think!
But I swear to God that there's nothing to it in my case!
You know my mother wouldn't stand for any of that kind of nonsense!
I can just hear her now "What are you doing Roy"?
"What are you doing"?
!
You handled that well!
That's the psychiatrist!
Yes, I I think she's my girlfriend now.
No, Moss!
Listen to me.
You can never see that woman again.
She looks exactly like my mother.
Oh stop it.
You're exaggerating.
She's the spit of her!
Oh come on.
What went on in there?
All right.
Okay.
What would you say to a big girls' night out?
How big are the girls?
I can't believe I'd never seen "Steel Magnolias"!
Oh my God!
It's good, isn't it?
- I know what we could watch next!
- Yeah!
- Your really liked that film?
- Yes.
Didn't you?
No!
It was heart-warming!
Well I feel like a princess, Roy!
And don't tell me you don't feel the same!
Well, my breast-tenderness has gone.
No!
What am I talking about?
!
I'm a man!
We're men!
It's the worst night of my life!
Hiya!
Okay!
Beaches or Dirty Dancing!
Oh, Beaches!
No!

- Do!

I don't know which one to watch either!
Oh hey!
But you know what we should do?
- What?
- Something else!
Oh!
I know!
Why don't we go to the thank you party?
But I thought you didn't want to go.

What shall we do?
Nothing I just I really need to get drunk.
Yeah, I'd like to get drunk.
