{START OF EPISODE 1}
Good morning.
How do we turn this off?
Can you help me turn this off?
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
How do we turn this off?
Can you help me with this?
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
I didn't mean to snap.
Good morning.
Many of you are halfway through your first week here at Greendale, and as your dean I thought I would share a few thoughts of wisdom and inspiration.
What is community college?
Well, you've heard all kinds of things.
You've heard it's loser college for remedial teens, middle-aged divorcees, and old people keeping their minds active as they circle the drain of eternity.
That's what you've heard.
However, I wish you luck.
Okay, you know Uh-oh.
Okay, there's more to this speech.
There's actually a middle card that is missing.
Can we all look around our immediate areas?
Because I really wanted to I'm only half Arabic, actually.
My dad is Palestinian.
He's a U.S. citizen, he's not a threat to national security or anything.
Lot of people want to know after they meet him because he has angry energy.
Not like angry at America, just angry at my mom for leaving.
Although she did leave because he was angry.
And he was angry because she's American.
My name's Abed, by the way.
Abed, nice to know you and then meet you, in that order.
Now about that question that I had?
Oh, uh Five after 11 when you asked.
Abed.
Yeah.
What's the deal with the hot girl from Spanish class?
I can't find a road in there.
Well, I only talked to her once while she was borrowing a pencil.
Her name is Britta, she's She has two older brothers.
One works with children who have a disorder I might wanna look up.
And she thinks she's gonna flunk tomorrow's test.
So she really needs to focus.
And she's sorry if that makes her seem cold.
Holy crap.
Abed, I see your value now.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
Absolutely not.
If these guys knew you like I did, they would have given you a small office.
Jeff Winger, genius at law.
You gotta stop saying that.
I will never do that.
Sit down.
I still cannot figure out how you got a jury to connect September the 11 th with my DUI, let alone why that helped.
Well, 2002 was a simpler time.
So, what is my lawyer doing here?
I'm a student.
Well, that cannot be an inspiring journey.
I am in a bit of a jam.
The state bar has suspended my license.
They found out my college degree was less than legitimate.
I thought you had a bachelor's from Columbia.
Now I have to get one from America.
Oof.
And it can't be an e-mail attachment.
Well, you've picked a fine school.
Yes.
And I'm hoping that our friendship will yield certain advantages.
You know, academic guidance.
Yes.
Moral support.
Every answer to every test for every one of the classes that I'm taking.
Here's my schedule.
Now, Jeff, just by asking that you have insulted the integrity of this entire institution.
Oi.
Waster.
Not a bathroom.
Not a bathroom.
Okay.
Duncan, you did seem less into integrity the day that I convinced that when you made that U-turn on the freeway and tried to order chalupas from the emergency call box that your only real crime was loving America.
Well, I do love America.
I love it very much.
Mm?
L I love chalupas.
But I'll look into it.
Thank you.
Duncan, you are a good man.
Jeff, are you familiar with the adage "Cheaters never prosper"?
No.
And if I wanted to learn something, I wouldn't have come to community college.
Oh, hey, Spanish.
Yeah, don't hit on me, okay?
Uh, I wouldn't dream of it.
I just wanted to let you know about my Spanish study group.
Oh, whoa, whoa.
The guy who's playing "Bejeweled" on his iPhone all class has a study group?
Can I sign up twice?
I'm taking the class as an easy credit.
I'm actually a Spanish tutor.
Board certified.
Can you say that in Spanish now?
I really need help with Spanish.
Yeah, I was willing to bet.
I'm Jeff.
Or jefe.
The group meets at the library at 4.
Britta.
Thanks.
You're gonna be there?
That means, "See you there".
Shouldn't be too hard to fake a study group, right?
Huh?
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.
I was raised on TV, and I was conditioned to believe that every black woman over 50 is a cosmic mentor.
Were you conditioned to pay for your damn tacos, Seinfield?
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
It's "Seinfeld".
Hey, all right, come on in.
I've got the whole table.
Welcome.
Yeah, the whole room.
Here's the contact sheet.
Just put your stuff there.
That's Man, the rest of the group is running late.
But you and I can get acquainted.
You may have noticed this morning, not so good at the small talk.
Yeah, I like big talk.
What's your deal?
That's not small talk?
What's your deal and is God dead?
All right, you wanna know my deal?
Mm.
I dropped out of high school because I thought for some reason it would impress Radiohead.
You'd be surprised what gets back to those guys.
I joined the Peace Corps.
I did a little foot modeling.
I got tear gassed at a world trade rally Marry me.
Ha.
And I guess, Jeff, my deal is, above all else, honesty.
Honesty.
Yeah.
You tell me the truth, I will like you.
You lie to me, I will never talk to you again.
That's my deal.
That's a good deal.
So, what's your deal?
Uh I would have to go I would have to say, um, honesty.
Because I would say anything to get what I want, and I want you to like me.
So Well, that's a very honest answer.
All right, for now, I like you fine.
Really?
Wow.
You're easy.
Hell, yeah.
Abed.
In the house.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo.
Why?
Britta invited me.
Is that cool?
Oh, I can't think of a single logical reason why not.
Cool.
There you go.
Oh, hey, here.
Put your contact info down right there.
That's right.
Cool, cool, cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Hey, this is kind of like Breakfast Club, huh?
We are in a library.
Yeah.
I'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside that would make us cry if we talked about it.
Do you have something balled up inside you?
Oh, I got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional.
Hey, text message.
Let's give this bad boy a read.
It's probably just for you.
I've never gotten one of these.
Uh, it's probably You just It's just for your eyes.
"Say you have to pee.
I need to talk to you".
"Say you have to pee".
That is weird.
"Say you have to pee".
Yeah.
Do you have to pee?
No.
That's so weird.
Well, I'm stumped.
That's very creepy.
That makes two of us.
What's that?
Does it say you have to pee?
No, it's just someone with a misguided grasp of abbreviation.
I just need five minutes, you guys.
So go ahead and study all the verbs in Spanish.
Abed, what's your read on that guy?
Yeah.
You look like Elizabeth Shue.
Just act natural, pretend you're watching the athletic proceedings.
You couldn't stop me from watching them.
There's a guy trying out for track that is older than the game of poker.
He's kind of trucking.
Suppose I was to say to you it was possible to get those test answers.
I would say go for that.
And could have said so in a text.
I'm asking if you know the difference between right and wrong.
I discovered at a very early age that if I talked long enough, I could make anything right or wrong.
So either I'm God or truth is relative, and in either case, booyah.
Oh.
Interesting.
It's just, the average person has a much harder time saying booyah to moral relativism.
Duncan, you don't have to play shrink to protect your pride.
I accept you're chicken.
You trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist?
No, I'm just using regular psychology on a spineless British twit.
I'm a professor.
You can't talk to me that way.
A 6-year-old girl could.
Yes, because that would be adorable.
No, because you're a 5-year-old girl, and there's a pecking order.
Fine, I'll do it.
Thank you.
Yeah, with pleasure.
Bye.
Yes, good.
Why am I still shouting?
I'm drawing attention to myself.
You guys aren't going to believe this but the rest of the group is here.
Are you the board-certified tutor?
That means you do my homework, right, Seacrest?
I need to call my babysitter if we gonna be late.
What board certifies a tutor?
Where's Britta?
Not sure.
I invited people from Spanish class.
Is that cool?
It's the coolest.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
And bring my jacket, wallet and keys with me in case there's a fire.
Should we go with him?
Gonna leave my homework with Slumdog Millionaire.
That's borderline racist.
And busted.
Listen Now you know.
I'm a smoker.
Yeah, but they're filtered, so that makes them safe.
You ready to get started?
Looks like your group showed up.
Not mine.
I think Abed took out a page on Craigslist.
And I was trained never to say this, but I think that group may be untutorable.
Oh, really?
Why don't you and I go study over Dinner?
Or drinks.
I think, actually, we should prioritize here and study first and then go to dinner.
And if they really prove to be untutorable, we'll slip out early.
Oh, they will be untutorable.
All right.
Look at this crew.
All ready to study all night.
I can stay at least till 10.
But who studies with strangers, right?
My name is Jeff.
Jeff, it's a pleasure.
My name is Pierce Hawthorne.
And, yes, that is Hawthorne as in Hawthorne Wipes the award-winning moist towelette.
I was just gonna ask.
I'm a Toastmaster.
I should do the introductions.
Definitely.
You know Brittles.
Britta.
Abed.
Abed the Arab.
Is that inappropriate?
Sure.
Roy, Roy, the wonder boy Troy.
Little princess Elizabeth Annie.
And, finally, this beautiful creature is named Shirley.
Is that even close?
I'd like to know why I had to find out about this group on accident.
Way more like Breakfast Club now.
There's breakfast?
We should get started I've been a part of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension.
Shouldn't we address Annie's concern?
Did we not invite her?
Sweetie, it's not behind your back Can we stop with the "pumpkins" and the "sweeties"?
Being younger does not make me inferior.
If anything, your age indicates that you've made bad life decisions.
Shirley has a response to that.
No, no, no.
I don't.
It looks like you do.
Shirley, go ahead.
Okay, okay.
I'm sure I've made some bad life decisions.
And maybe Annie's decisions will be better.
I think she needs to decide whether she wants to be considered a child or an adult, because children get pity, but not respect, and adults, they get respect.
They also get their head grabbed and pushed through jukeboxes.
Okay.
Why don't we try learning "jukebox" in Spanish?
What are you doing?
Pierce.
Let's discuss this creepiness.
Pardon you?
What are you doing?
I'm certified.
Are you unaware that Shirley finds your advances inappropriate?
What advances?
You have been sexually harassing me since the very first day of class.
Sexually harassing?
What?
That makes no sense to me.
Why would I harass somebody who turns me on?
Saying she turns you on is the harassment, dude.
Hey.
I am a prominent business leader and a highly sought-after dinner guest.
And I will not take courting advice from some teenage boy.
Well, this teenage boy is a quarterback and a prom king.
You're not prom king anymore, Troy.
This isn't Riverside High.
How'd you know I went there?
Because you're still wearing your stupid letter jacket, and, more importantly, I sat behind you in Algebra.
Were you that girl got hooked on pills and dropped out?
You're little Annie Adderall.
And you're a stupid jock who lost scholarship by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand.
Keg flip.
They're very hard to pull off.
Don't talk to me.
You don't know I'm a legend.
You know what I got for Christmas?
It was a banner year at the Bender family.
I got a carton of cigarettes.
The old man grabbed me.
He said, "Hey, smoke up, Johnny".
No, Dad, what about you?
Well, that actually was from The Breakfast Club.
Nobody puts Baby in the corner.
Dirty Dancing.
Hello?
It's Professor Duncan.
Come to the parking lot now.
What's wrong with your voice?
I'm disguising it.
I'll be right back.
But while I'm gone, you guys need to hash this stuff out.
No stone unturned.
Go.
Get in the car.
Act as if we've either just finished or are yet to begin driving.
Every answer to every test in your curriculum this semester.
I knew you could do it, buddy.
Thank you.
Whoa, there, grabby grabby.
What do I get?
The satisfaction of being even.
Even, fairness, right, wrong.
There is no God.
Booyah, booyah.
What do you want from me?
Your Lexus.
My car for a semester's worth of answers?
Will it be just a semester, though, Jeff?
Won't you be taking the easy way out for the next four years?
I want payment in advance.
I want leather seats with built-in ball warmers.
You know, bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies.
Have a nice disbarment hearing.
What am I supposed to drive?
Take this car.
It's good for the earth.
So is wiping your butt with a leaf but it's not how a man gets around.
Golf cart.
It is a disaster in there.
Yeah.
Untutorable.
Do you like Thai food?
I love Thai food.
Wait.
So this is a game to you?
You put human beings into a state of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants?
Why can't you see that for the compliment that it is?
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.
I did a little bit of lying to get close to you.
But how was I supposed to know that you were smart and cool.
You look like Elizabeth Shue.
You're unbelievable.
What do you want me to do?
Maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess.
Okay, if I do that, then dinner, right?
Yeah, fine, whatever.
As if there's a dinner on earth that could make me forget you are a shallow douche bag.
Oh, you're gonna eat those words when you see my new car.
All right, everybody.
I wanna say something.
Sit down.
Well, you don't have to yell.
I don't appreciate your tone.
What makes humans different from other animals?
Feet.
No, no.
Come on, bears have feet.
We're the only species on earth that observes "Shark Week".
Sharks don't even observe "Shark Week," but we do.
For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you it's name is Steve and go like this.
Oh.
And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside.
Because people can connect with anything.
We can sympathize with a pencil, we can forgive a shark, and we can give Ben Affleck an Academy Award for screenwriting.
Big mistake.
People can find the good in just about anything but themselves.
Look at me.
It's clear to all of you that I am awesome.
But I could never admit that.
That would make me an ass.
But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome.
She's driven.
We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts.
And Pierce, we need guys like Pierce.
This guy has wisdom to offer.
The Dalai Lama and l We should listen to him some time.
We wouldn't regret it.
And Shirley, Shirley has earned our respect.
Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman.
Don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was too specific to be improvised.
And Troy.
Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that?
Maybe he is.
You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen?
No, they're trying to impress their high school's prom king.
And Abed.
Abed's a shaman.
You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup.
Because you know what, soup is better.
Abed is better.
You are all better than you think you are.
You are designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.
Soup?
I want you to look to the person to your left.
Sorry.
Look at the person sitting next to you.
Look at her.
Okay.
This?
Yeah.
I want you to extend to that person the same compassion you extend to sharks, pencils and Ben Affleck.
I want you to say to that person, "I forgive you".
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
You little twerp.
Pierce, I'd like you to say, "I forgive you".
He didn't say it?
I forgive you.
You've just stopped being a study group.
You have become something unstoppable.
I hereby pronounce you a community.
Oh, that's nice.
I like that.
This isn't like Breakfast Club anymore.
It's Stripes or Meatballs.
Anything with Bill Murray.
I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special.
And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta.
Britta?
I lied.
Thanks for calming everyone down.
But since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me.
I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time.
Everybody ready?
Fine.
And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test.
And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I wasted more than they wasted mine.
Jeff, if you have all the answers, why the hell did you start this group?
I don't have a study group.
I made it up.
What about the speech?
Made it up.
That's what I do.
I make things up.
And I got paid a lot of money to do it.
Before I came to this school-shaped toilet, I was a lawyer.
Oh, man, this ruins everything.
I thought you were like Bill Murray in his films.
But you're more like Michael Douglas in his films.
Yeah?
Well, you have Asperger's.
What does that mean?
Ha, ha.
Ass burger.
It's a serious disorder.
It really is.
If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis?
Heh, heh.
Yeah.
Heh, heh.
Ass burger.
Burger for your ass.
Jeffrey, before you say anything, you might want to think about the gift you've been given.
An excuse to punch a hippy?
No.
No, not that.
An important lesson, my friend.
You see, the tools you acquired to survive out there will not help you here at Greendale.
What you have, my friend, is a second chance at an honest life.
Why are people trying to teach me things at a school that has an express tuition aisle?
Give me my keys.
No, I have to keep your car for the lesson.
Don't hit me.
Please don't hit me.
Jeffrey?
Jeffrey?
Are we cool?
Are we cool?
We cool.
I like you, Jeffrey.
You remind me of myself at your age.
I deserve that.
You know I've been divorced seven times?
Sometimes I think I'm doing something wrong.
You keep getting married.
I never looked at it that way.
Shouldn't you guys be studying?
Yeah, things got kind of boring after you left.
Let me ask you something.
People have been clowning me about this jacket since I got here.
But, if I take it off to make them happy, that just makes me weak, right?
Listen, it doesn't matter.
You lose the jacket to please them, you keep it to piss them off.
Either way, it's for them.
That's what's weak.
Whoa.
You just wrinkled my brain, man.
He's good, isn't he?
He's real good.
Shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers?
I don't have any of the answers.
I'm gonna flunk the test.
If you just, like, study for an hour, it's not that hard.
You seem pretty smart.
You got a sports coat.
Well, the funny thing about being smart is you can get through most of life without having to do work.
So I'm not really sure how to do that.
Please?
So sad?
He makes me wanna What's going on?
Can you guys hear me?
Am I deaf?
Can you hear me talking right now?
Yes.
That's good.
You know what, Jeff, actually, we didn't get that far without you.
So if you wanna come back upstairs Really?
Well, it is your study group, so Come on, let's study.
Sounds good.
Come on.
Pressure.
I'm sorry I called you Michael Douglas.
And I see your value now.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Good afternoon, Greendale Community College.
I am your dean with a few corrections to the fall class catalogue.
Cosmology should be Cosmetology.
Astrology should be Astronomy.
The students on the cover should be smiling, but I suppose that's a matter of opinion.
Whoever is growing a small patch of cannabis behind the gymnasium, congratulations, you have won a cruise.
Report to security to claim your tickets.
In order to increase awareness of homelessness, security has been given binoculars.
In campus news, the debate over our library's PA system continues, with some students suggesting its volume be lowered while others question its very purpose.
More on that story as it unfolds.
That dude makes a lot of announcements.
I like it.
It makes every 10 minutes feel like a new scene of a TV show.
The illusion lasts until someone says something they never say on TV, like how much life is like TV.
There, it's gone.
I guess Jeff's running late again.
Oh.
What a shame.
Maybe we should get started No, no, no.
I think we should wait for Jeff before we start studying.
But when Jeff gets here, we could talk to him, as a group, about his tardiness.
Oh, come on now.
Don't use that word around Abed.
If you want me to have a chat with Jeff, I'd do it.
We've got a bond going, kind of, sort of like brothers.
Hope your mom didn't make you take baths together.
Because one of you would have been like 30.
Ha, ha, ha.
That's funny.
Jeff probably comes late so he doesn't have to sit through your tardiness.
Sorry, Abed.
Hey, will you guys have some self-respect?
You are obsessing over someone who does not give you a second thought.
Meanwhile, in Guatemala, journalists are being killed by their own government.
You jumped a column there.
What's happening in Guatemala?
Nothing.
Journalists are being murdered?
Believe me, every day in that country, people are killed for speaking out.
The worst part of it is, when it's all over, Spoilers.
It's as if it never happened.
Hey, Abed, real stories, they don't have spoilers.
You understand that TV and life are different, right?
Hey.
My lady.
My lord.
Hey, baby.
Hi, sweetie.
You smell nice.
Vitamin P. Morning, Jeffrey.
People were jazzed to see me too.
Word them up.
Word them everywhere.
Good entrance.
Thank you.
It was for you.
Britta.
Hey, Jeff.
I think there's something that the group would like to talk to you about.
Actually, there's nothing more to say.
Nice jacket.
If you're gonna study with people, it would be cool of you to show up on time.
Oh.
Were you waiting?
No.
I just got here.
No.
You guys spend the first 20 minutes talking about your interesting lives and your cool emotional problems.
I feel like I never have anything to offer.
Ohh.
No, no.
Truth is, my life is emptier than this three-ring binder.
Annie, do you have any Spanish notes that might fit in there?
Wow.
Double-spaced.
Thank you.
So what's a guy gotta do to get a C around here?
That's the one.
Good study.
Thanks for good study.
See you later.
Hey, you know what today is?
The two-week anniversary of my horrible first impression.
There's a card for that?
Well, not specifically.
But if you think of grandsons as metaphors for friendship, you'll agree with this Transformer here that it's time for ours to become a man by reading from the Torah.
Look, Jeff, you're harmless enough to me.
A life full of ups and downs has given me douche-ray vision.
But those are good people in there, and they trust and respect you, and watching you exploit them bums me out.
Exploit them?
They're my friends.
Can I bring your car around?
No, Abed, I don't want you bring my car around.
I'll bring yours around, good guy.
You get going, all right?
You're cute but selfish, and narcissistic to the point of near-delusion.
She said I was cute.
Tell you what.
You take her.
I have less to prove.
You know, Jeff, you can't pursue people so desperately.
It starts to creep them out.
Why don't we get a beer?
I'll give you advice, and we can have what the kids are calling a sausage fest.
I'm not much of a sausage guy, Pierce.
Maybe next time.
Next time then.
Hey.
Will you tell us more about Guatemala?
I wanna be political.
That's good.
You should discover that stuff on your own.
We need your help.
We've been living on the wrong side of the looking glass.
You're like Jodie Foster or Susan Sarandon.
You'd rather keep it real than be likeable.
Can you at least tell us what to Google?
You could start with the journalist Chacata-Panecos.
He wrote an article critical of the government and they killed him.
Oh.
That's horrible.
Can we have a protest?
I wanna protest the hell out of something.
A candlelight vigil, like lesbians on the news.
I could make brownies.
Brownies?
Every once in a while, a student will ask: "Señor Chang, why do you teach Spanish"?
They say it just like that.
"Why do you teach Spanish"?
Why you.
Why not math?
Why not photography?
Why not martial arts?
I mean, surely it must be in my nature to instruct you in something that's ancient and secret like, oh, building a wall that you can see from outer space.
Well, I'll tell you why I teach Spanish.
It is none of your business, okay?
Now, I don't wanna have any conversations about what a mysterious, inscrutable man I am.
I am a Spanish genius.
In español my nickname is El Tigre Chino.
Because my knowledge will bite her face off.
So don't question Señor Chang or you'll get bit.
Yeah, bit.
Yeah, bit.
Okay, Friday mañana, we'll be having conversations with the rest of the class, using some phrases we learned in unit one.
You'll be partnering up in pairs of dos.
Heh.
So if you look under your desk, you will find a card with either a picture or a word on it, okay?
Por ejemplo, Blondie, aqui, has a card with a picture of a house on it.
So that means the person with the card with the word "casa" on it is her partner.
Comprende, Star-Burns?
Okay, see you Friday, find your partners, have a great day.
And what do we say at the end of every class?
Come on, hands.
Ninety percent of Spanish.
Good.
Abed, do you want to trade cards?
No.
I'll give you 20 bucks.
No.
Fifty bucks.
No.
I don't want money.
I want your shirt.
What?
I've had my eye on it since registration day.
Fine.
Give me your card.
I don't think you understand.
I wanna wear it out of here.
Thanks.
What are the odds?
Are you sure you didn't adjust the odds?
I know Abed's been eyeing that shirt for three weeks.
It's almost like you gave it to him so he would switch cards.
I gave Abed my shirt because I'm not selfish.
Which is something I guess you'll finally discover while we work on this.
Tomorrow night?
Dinner, drinks?
I think that's something that we should discuss with our partners.
Oh, see, I did switch cards.
Can you believe this?
What are the odds?
Heh, heh.
That's a nice shirt.
Wanna sell it?
Yes.
What's the moist towelette industry like?
Oh.
Believe me, it's nothing like the product.
No, it's a hard, dry, large business.
Destroyed all my marriages.
It didn't help any that I can't have children.
I'm not sterile.
In fact it's a rare condition called hyper-virility.
Apparently my sperm shoot through the egg like bullets.
Heh.
Can you believe that?
I can't.
But you can, so that's fine.
So the assignment is to write a Spanish conversation using those five phrases that Ooh.
Hemingway's lemonade.
We don't need to make this a long evening.
What am I, a piece of garbage to you?
What?
No.
Got you.
Hey, come on, let's have one drink before we work.
Mm, mm, mm.
To the empowerage of words.
To the irony of that sentence.
So, what's up with you?
It seems like you got a burr up your ass or something.
Well, I guess that it's, uh I think it's Britta.
Forget Britta.
All you have to know about her is her name.
What is she, a water filter?
I mean, heh, heh, she's ugly.
Okay.
Why don't we start with me saying, donde What the hell are you doing?
Our assignment.
Oh, no, no, no.
This is the first time people are gonna see Winger and Hawthorne together.
We're gonna show them we're to be reckoned with.
Come on, let's brainstorm some story ideas.
Better yet, before we do that, let's ask ourselves what is a story?
Oh, my God in heaven.
Guatemala, we hate Guatemala, we hate If you like that brownie, you're gonna hate what's going on in Guatemala.
Google it.
Oh, hey, hey.
Hi.
Raise the truth.
Okay, once it gets dark, I hand out the candles, and we do what's called a speechless protest.
We put tape over our mouths and gather hand in hand in a sea of outraged silence.
Star-Burns, no, no.
What's gotten into you?
This is not how you do this.
It's not how you do it.
We're doing everything.
But this is tacky and lame.
I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry.
What I meant to say was that this cause is really personal to me.
Are you saying that we're not allowed to protest?
Britta, you sound like Guatemala.
Somebody has a case of "use fringe politics to make themselves feel special but doesn't ever do anything".
Itis.
No, I do things.
I I went to I don't do anything.
What can I do?
You can hang the Chacata-Panecos piñata.
You guys realize he was beaten to death, right?
That's where we got the idea from.
Poignant.
All right.
Okay, tell me what I've got so far.
What we have so far?
Well, we have something incredibly long and very confusing, and a little homophobic.
And really, really, specifically, surprisingly and gratuitously critical of Israel.
It's called "Two Conquistadors.
" Should be dos.
I mean, it is Spanish class.
Oh, which reminds me.
The only thing not included in this epic are the five phrases required to get me a passing grade.
You're right.
Needs more work.
What are you guys doing?
I have no idea.
We're headed to the demonstration.
Hippies?
Some cause Britta's into.
It's a silent protest, lots of candles.
Gets the ladies in the mood for social change, if you know what I mean.
Good chance to put some miles on this shirt.
You realize these conversations are due in the morning, don't you?
Oh, yeah.
Right.
What do you wanna do?
Tsk.
Hacks.
Okay, what do we do about the ending of act two?
I'll tell you what we're going to do.
We are gonna take this and we're gonna put it in a museum for crazy people.
And then we're going to take this and memorize five phrases from it tomorrow morning before class.
Good night.
Wait a minute.
You're bailing on our first sausage fest?
This is your definition of friendship?
No, this is my definition of you trying way too hard and me finding it harder and harder to stay polite.
This was a fine enough way to spend an evening devoid of hope, but the woman I kind of like is out in the moonlight caring about something stupid.
And this is my chance to show her that I care enough to act like I care about it too.
That's all you had to say, Jeff.
That was it?
Oh.
That would have been great if I had done that two hours ago.
Nice sign.
Thanks.
I like what you've done with the place.
I think was a little too harsh on you.
I'm not perfect.
I am.
I'd be happy to show you the ropes.
Awesome.
Look at awesome Jeffrey Winger.
Too awesome for old Pierce with your hip shirts and your gelled hair and your cool tape over your mouth.
Why is everybody wearing tape over their mouth?
It's a protest, Pierce.
Oh, good.
Because I know what I'd like to protest.
How much you hurt me.
Conflicts like these will ultimately bring us together as an unlikely family.
You have horrible breath right now.
First, you constantly blow me off, then you want me to do your homework.
Then you tell me I'm trying too hard to be your friend so you have to go.
You had to come out here to pretend to care about the stupid stuff she cares about.
His words, not mine.
He is paraphrasing.
I got an idea.
Why don't you go get a cup of coffee and hold some waitress hostage with a monologue about sperm.
I'll show you some sperm, buddy.
Is this your idea?
What the hell?
Fire.
No, I'm not ready to die.
Oh.
Oh.
He's He's jumped in the fountain.
He's fine.
Please call 911.
Have you seen it?
We did it, girl.
Page three.
It's about Pierce, but listen to that paragraph.
"The incident occurred during a protest regarding events in Guatemala".
Awareness.
This isn't the school paper.
This is a real damn newspaper.
There's a Marmaduke in here.
It's more than I ever accomplished.
You know about ethnic cleansing in Burma?
We need to bust out that brownie mix.
Morning.
Morning.
Oh, no, I get it.
Garfield's wishing me a happy Arbor Day, and you'd like a fresh start.
Nice try.
It's actually Secretaries Day.
It says that I'm sorry about crashing your protest with that drunken, self-immolating baby boomer.
We don't blame you.
Pierce has been on my watch list.
That dude is crazy.
He told me girls have two pee holes.
I sang Christmas carols at a nursing home once.
I've seen the face of dementia, and last night, I saw it again.
You know what he did that's really crazy?
He offered me a 100 dollars to switch cards with him just so he could be partners with Jeff.
I think he thought getting closer to Jeff would bring him respect in the group.
I think he spent his whole life looking out for himself, and he would trade it all for a shot at some kind of family.
Hola, class.
All right, time for our presentations.
First up was supposed to be Jeff and Pierce, but Pierce explained the situation to me.
There was a falling out, things were said, people were betrayed.
Wow.
Jeff, having heard Pierce's side of the story, the thing to do would be to give you a C and let Pierce do his presentation alone.
If that sounds fair to you.
That doesn't sound fair to me at all.
I understand if you don't wanna be my friend.
But this thing that we've created, it is bigger than the both of us, and it deserves to be done right.
All right.
Okay, um, guys, why are there costumes involved?
These are short conversations.
They're not supposed to take Your breath away?
Well, tough.
You ready, amigo?
F, F-minus.
What?
Did you say S?
So that was one of the worst things I have ever seen.
Which I guess makes being a part of it a pretty selfless act.
So I'm impressed.
How do you know I didn't do it just to get another shot at you?
A smart guy like you would know that no woman in that class will be able to look at you as a sexually viable candidate ever again.
No, I know.
I thought of that.
She looked back.
You did an all right job up there, my friend.
Thanks, Pierce.
A couple of notes.
You got this thing you do with your face when you're trying to be funny .
that forces people to think about how cool you think you are.
Yeah, boy, boy.
Yeah.
What.
It's 2009.
Word.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hey, man.
My name is Jeff.
I'm trying to lock down the rest of my schedule before the deadline.
I heard this class was a cakewalk.
Are you passing it?
Do you like Dane Cook?
Yeah, he's awesome.
So far so good.
Death, so called Is a thing that makes men weep And yet a third of life Is spent in sleep Open your text books to page 37.
Now close them and throw them away.
Throw it away.
Ha-ha-ha.
Throw it away.
For those who are new, the motto of this class, carpe diem, seize the day, no tests, no papers.
You want an A?
Live in the moment.
Jackpot.
Take off your shoes.
Quick, take off your shoes.
Everyone, take your shoes off, throw them away.
Throw them across the room over there.
Today we learn to walk, get up and walk out the door.
This day could be your last.
You could die in your sleep.
You could get hit by a bus.
You, that mole is raised and dark, it's not a good combo.
You are new.
Yes, I'm new, but I'll be old too soon.
Carpe diem, sir, carpe diem.
I like it!
Voice command.
Voice command.
Voice command.
Voice command.
Voice command.
Voice comm Would you please use the buttons?
Okay, grandpa.
Achoo!
Oh.
God bless you, dear.
What's so funny?
You guys, I found it.
The ultimate blow-off class.
Professor Whitman, he thinks he's in Dead Poets Society.
There's no tests, there's no work, it's just day seizing.
The deadline to enroll is tomorrow.
I suggest you all do it.
Well, some of us are here to actually learn things.
I'm in.
Me too, it sounds educational.
I'll do it, I love Robin Williams.
Abed?
Not a fan.
In every movie, there's an authority figure that gets mad at him for making people laugh.
No, are you going to take the class?
Oh, can't.
My dad will only pay for classes that will help me run the family restaurant.
It's been struggling since 2001, 9/11 was pretty much the 9/11 of the falafel business.
So your dad has your whole life planned out for you?
Are you even interested in falafel?
I'm interested in making movies.
But my Dad says all media's western propaganda that negatively stereotypes Arabs.
Then he should see Aladdin, Jafar was a badass.
Yes, he was.
Yeah.
He was.
Abed, how much does a film class cost?
Seventy dollars.
Britta?
Jeff?
Britta.
Isn't Abed's dad a hardcore Muslim?
They're not as understanding as Christians.
You could get your head cut off with a salami sword.
Shirley, that's the most racist thing I've ever heard.
Pierce will beat that in one minute.
This is really nice of you.
The memo says, "For dreams".
Aw.
You guys, are we going to study Spanish, or keep getting involved in each other's personal lives?
Achoo!
Hey, Troy sneezes like a girl.
How about I pound you like a boy?
That didn't come out right.
Why don't you leave him alone with his cute baby sneezes.
You're not my mother.
She's not?
Twenty-nine seconds.
What's your name?
My name is Shirley Bennett.
Shirley, you get an A, Oh.
If you can tell me why you are here at Greendale.
What did I tell you?
Okay, but, uh, never again.
Shirley?
To get a degree in business so I can sell my baked goods and whatnot on the Internet.
Why are you here?
To get a degree in business so I can sell my baked goods and whatnot on the Internet.
Why are you here?
Because I wasted 15 years of my life on a man who left me with nothing but stretch marks and a foggy memory of two bland orgasms.
And now it's time to get what's mine.
Day seized.
Only when we stop stopping our lives can we begin to start starting them.
Ms. Edison here, for example, would rather write what happens to other people than live what is happening to her.
I thought there might be a quiz.
Well, here's a quiz for you.
Why did the pretty young girl die alone, surrounded by sweater-wearing cats who were trained to use human toilets?
Get up on your desk.
Come on, stand on your desk.
Up on your desk.
She made it.
Ha-ha.
Everyone, stand on your desks.
Up, up, up.
Come on.
Rise, rise, rise above the programming.
All your lives you were told don't stand on your desk.
Well, why not?
She's okay, go to the nurse, seize the day.
You know, I was very moved by your honesty earlier.
Particularly the part about, uh, your husband not being Your homework.
Ah.
Oh.
I want you to swim in a lake and tell 10 people that you love them.
Mr. Winger, may I have a word, please?
Are you okay?
Oh.
Oh, maybe, I'm not.
Hi, Mr. Winger, I like to think that every life that passes through this class is changed.
But every year, there's always one cocky opportunist who's just here to coast and grab an easy A. Oh, yeah.
His name is Pierce, I can talk to him for you.
It's actually you, Mr. Winger.
You have no intention of seizing the day.
What?
Listen, l I have never lived until I met you.
L I love you.
There's one down, nine to go.
Not that I need the grade or even want it.
Well, glad to hear it, because if you don't genuinely seize the day before the end of the week, then you will be seizing an F for the semester.
This is no way to teach accounting.
I have to plan in advance how to prove that I live in the moment.
I'd rather take an actual class, but now it's too late to drop or add.
It is not fair how hard it is for you to cheat here.
Hah!
Hey, how's it going?
How's your film class, buddy?
It's cool.
Our first assignment is a documentary.
They're like real movies but with ugly people.
I'm learning a lot.
That is so wonderful.
Some people don't like getting involved in others' lives.
I think it's great.
Hey, if you're making a documentary about Britta patting herself on the back, you're gonna need a backup battery.
Actually, I'm doing a movie about my dad.
That is brilliant.
How did he react to you signing up for the film class?
That part hasn't happened yet.
Here he comes.
Hey, you want to get involved in my family's business?
Holy war.
Where do I find Mr. Britta?
I'm Mr. Britta.
That's right, I'm a woman with rights.
And you can see my whole face.
Oh.
I get it, because I'm Arab I must hate women.
Let me tell you something.
I love women.
But I'm getting a major B-word vibe from you.
Ow, I can't believe I missed out on getting involved in this.
You go host American Idol, and you stop messing with my son.
He is a special boy.
I raise him.
You don't.
Raising him means letting him follow dreams.
Dreams are for sleeping.
You don't know that.
It's clinically proven.
So is polio.
You lost me.
Abed wants to study film.
What's he saying?
He says we're leaving.
Tell him you wanna stay and study film.
I don't think I'm really in the scene.
See?
It's hard to talk to him before, now we have this between us.
Let's go.
Hey.
Hey.
Don't touch me.
You You don't touch me.
Stop.
Sir, you have a right to your faith and your family's privacy but Abed is an adult and a U.S. citizen.
Right?
Yeah.
And he has the right to stay.
Fine.
You want to raise him?
You raise him, I'm out.
Wait, what?
You know, I had a father like you.
And the day I finally cut myself loose is the day I finally started being happy.
That went well.
I have to make some adjustments to my film.
Jeff, I think you should play the role of my father.
I don't want to be your father.
It's perfect, you already know your lines.
Why are you dressed like an '80s rapist?
Professor Whitman comes by here every morning and I need him to see me celebrating life.
What's all that?
I am calculating Abed's expenses.
You know, there's books, there's meals, he's renting that camera.
He needs a little spending money.
Um All money is spending money.
Oh.
Um, Britta, it's amazing what you're doing for Abed.
I mean a lot of people talk a good game, but you, you follow through.
I love you.
Shirley, thank you.
Bet that doesn't happen to you a lot.
It happened yesterday.
Shirley's just doing her homework.
Hillary, thank you for getting people coffee.
I love you.
Abed, how's it going, buddy?
Good, my film is coming together.
Cool tie, Jeff, are you wearing that because you're playing the role of my dad, or is it really Christmas?
Definitely Christmas.
Is that a new camera?
Yeah.
It's more expensive but it lets me adjust really specific settings that most people don't notice or think about.
Hi, I would like a latte, and Jeff, let me get you something.
I'm okay.
Oh, come on, I got you.
No, really, I don't need anything No, really.
You're insulting me.
Look at all this cash.
Okay.
I will get a small, black coffee.
Boo.
An ordinary coffee for an ordinary life.
Good morning, Professor Whitman.
Sorry, Mr. Winger, these won't cut it.
Shazbat.
I shall have A birthday cake.
I've seen men in your situation, Troy.
No, those are both for me.
You were on top of the world before and now no one gives a rat's ass.
I can help you with your image.
First, I'd lose the jacket, you look like a high school bitch.
But more importantly, it's your sneeze.
When I was a CEO, I had an array of masculine sneezes that asserted dominance.
Like the explosive shock-the-room-into-silence sneeze.
Or, the draw them in sneeze, you know.
You know, maybe I wouldn't sneeze, because I'm in control.
You can even use a sneeze to drive home a point.
Like, I think the Cubs are gonna win it all this year.
What do you think?
Tell me more.
It's show time.
Hey, everybody, good morning.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Greendale.
Hi, good morning.
Watch the kite.
Uh-oh.
Mind if I get a chance?
Oh!
Thanks, you guys, bring it in here.
Nice.
Thank you so much, you guys, that was really fun.
Sloppy.
Considering the age of these girls, unwittingly creepy.
Damn it.
Beat it.
Professor.
Will you look at the amount of work that I'm putting into this?
I mean, throw me a bone.
Had I not already cried at the sunrise this morning, I would be weeping right now.
What does that mean?
What do you mean, Jeff?
What does your life mean?
How long does it take you in the morning to make it look like you have bed-head?
How many sweatpants- sports jacket combos did you try before you found the one that said, "I don't care"?
Seize the day, Jeff.
For real.
Go running naked in a hail storm.
Kiss a girl in the middle of the day.
Fly a kite, but do it for yourself.
Or you won't just fail my class, you'll fail life.
Thank you.
That guy's really got your number.
Drop the flower.
I need to talk to you about Abed.
I went by his film class today, he wasn't there, he's cutting.
I wanna know why he would do something like that.
Ask him.
Every time I try to ask him about it, he just keeps filming me and telling me that I'm playing the role of his mother.
Abed is not normal.
That's what you bought when you intentionally tangled yourself in his life.
Look, will you just Will you please talk to him?
I've got problems of my own.
I'm out here trying to seize a day.
What in the hell?
Is he gonna kill us?
Thanks for the pizza, Abed, I was starving.
Yeah, it's nice, like a picnic.
Or a family dinner.
It's a study group and a pizza, let's not get carried away.
So, Abed.
How's film class?
Good.
Yeah.
Did you go to class today?
Not really.
Not really.
Well, Britta's paying for those classes, don't you think maybe you should go?
I was shooting my movie.
Your movie is for class.
My movie's more important.
La-la-la.
Someone order seven lattes?
I got that.
No, You don't got it.
I got it, Abed.
I got everything.
What is wrong with you, all I want to do is take care of you.
I know you're not stupid, are you doing this on purpose?
Why won't you answer me?
This is the scene where you leave.
You better believe it.
Britta.
What do you think, Dad?
I think you are really weird, Abed.
And I think the wrong person just left.
Perfect.
That's a wrap.
That guy was your dad?
Hey.
Hey.
You don't really have tickets for Ravi Shankar, do you.
I lied to get you here because it's time to communicate.
Communicate?
Have you met Abed?
It's not the two of you that need to talk.
Hey, wait a minute, where's Weezer?
They're coming.
All right.
Now, the only reason why this whole mess got started is because both of you wanted the best for Abed.
And I think the lesson we can all take away from this is that everyone should always do whatever they want, and leave each other out of it.
Is that your take?
Let me give you mine.
You and your pillow-lipped girlfriend got all up in my stuff because you wanted to be cowboys, and then you turned chicken when you found out it would take more than speeches and guided missiles.
Interesting, I hadn't seen the Iraq metaphor.
What Iraq metaphor?
I'm talking about your speeches and her guided Got it.
The point is, is that Britta is sorry, right?
Wrong.
Crap.
Abed may not be a great filmmaker but that doesn't mean that he wants to make falafel.
You need to let him make his own decisions.
Make his own decisions?
Have you met Abed?
You know who he is?
You have no Guys.
You're stupid.
I'm finished.
Britta, Jeff, Dad.
Dad.
How's it going, buddy?
I don't want to be your father.
I think you are weird, Abed.
Hey, look.
I need to talk to you about Abed.
He's not normal.
What is wrong with you?
All I want to do is take care of you.
Why will you not answer me?
What do you think, dad?
I think you are weird, Abed.
And I think the wrong person just left.
It's not exactly Citizen Kane.
I feel a little out of the loop here.
That feeling is called the joy of freedom.
My son is hard to understand.
If making movies help him be understood, then I pay for the class.
I made this all happen.
With falafel as a fallback.
Abed.
Yeah?
Did you do all of that to me on purpose?
That's not a very nice way to treat your friends.
Well, Britta, it isn't called friend business, it's called show business.
He's smoking.
Honey, let him leave the nest.
Get your hand off of my knee.
God God bless you.
God bless you.
Thank you.
For someone who doesn't like getting involved, well, I owe you.
You owe me?
That can not be comfortable for you.
Hey, um You should kiss me right now.
Day seized!
We're even.
Ha-ha-ha.
A plus, Winger.
I know a life-changing kiss when I see one.
Wowee!
Yeah.
Fooled you.
Am I krumping?
No.
Am I krumping?
Am I krumping?
No.
No.
Am I krumping now?
No.
This is krumping.
We We're krumping.
No, you're not.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Ooh.
Nice day out today, isn't it?
Yeah, shoot.
You forget something?
Yeah, I forgot to stagger the timing of my exit with Shirley's.
We both have a class across campus and I can't go that kind of distance with "Oh, that's nice".
That's mean.
No, that's not nice.
I find Shirley very easy to talk to.
Besides, aren't you supposed to have like an Olympic gold medal in jibber jabber?
Yeah, but I'm a sprinter.
I'm at my best during high speed bursts of wit.
On a Shirley walk, I'd be winded by that stoner tree.
Hey, Britta.
Hi.
What's up?
Hey, Vaughn, how's it going?
No worries.
Interesting.
Because I might be worried if I was playing hacky sack a decade too late.
My class is that way.
All right.
I just want to point out that we easily walked more than a hundred yards with no awkward pauses.
And that is the sign of a true friend.
So I'm really glad you're not hitting on me anymore.
There's the awkward pause.
Aah!
Excuse me.
Oh, pardon me.
Professor Duncan.
Professor Duncan.
Uh, ooh, sorry.
Annie Edison, I'm in your 101 lecture.
Oh.
Hello.
I've heard about your special psych lab.
Ah.
The Duncan Principle.
Yes.
And I know it's limited to second year students, but I had a 4.0 at Riverside High.
And I'm not looking down on this school at all.
But I'm only here because of a brief addiction to pills that I was told would help me focus but they actually made me lose my scholarship and virginity.
Right.
If you will let me take your lab early, it would be a real feather in my transcript.
Okay.
I've actually been in this situation many times, so I'm just gonna be upfront.
I'm not allowed to date students.
Oh.
But if in spite of that you are still interested, then you may join the lab.
Oh!
Ah.
Okay, you need to bring two human subjects.
I asked politely and the panda took his pants off.
I never even knew that's what asexual meant.
I wonder what this express package could be.
Somebody had to get something to me very fast.
You brought your mail to campus.
Oh, yes.
My Ear-Noculars.
What is that?
It looks like your blue-tooth thingy.
No, no, no.
This is my cell phone headset.
And this is Ear-Noculars.
It's for spies and what-not.
Gives you sonic hearing.
All hearing is sonic.
What's that?
So who wants to be in a psych experiment?
Hey, guys, guys.
Annie is talking about some kind of experiment.
She's behind you.
Not interested.
Please.
You get paid.
Do they do stuff to your butt?
No.
Do you get paid more if they do stuff to your butt?
No.
It's fine, I'll do it, I'm in.
Yay.
How about you, Abed?
It's tomorrow.
Oof.
Tomorrow, they're showing all four Indiana Joneses at The Vista.
I'm really looking forward to the first three.
I bought a whip.
This is really important to me, Abed.
Could you please go as my friend?
My really good friend?
Well, I didn't realize we were really good friends.
I figured we were really more like Chandler and Phoebe.
They never really had stories together.
Sure, I'll do it, Chandler.
Oh, thank you, Abed.
Oh.
I'm gonna go save Britta from that dude.
Yeah, she looks like she's in trouble.
Hope he doesn't try to handsome her to death.
Ha-ha.
Hey.
What's up, man?
Hi, I'm Vaughn.
You in line?
Oh, no, no.
We're just, uh We're just chilling.
Hey, you're not gonna order coffee?
Oh, no, I was just seeing if Britta No judgment, bro.
I used to do coffee.
Then I made the switch to green tea, it's like filled with these antioxidants and stuff.
It's pretty tight.
Tight.
Yes, I've heard that about green tea.
I like green tea.
I should make the change.
Up top, sugar bear.
Yeah, give me some of that.
Small coffee, please.
Britta's making the change to green tea.
Good.
It'll be a scandal.
Welcome, research assistants.
Turn your attention to the monitor, you will see that our subjects are waiting for the experiment to begin.
But it's actually happening right now.
You see, the waiting is the experiment.
The Duncan Principle is simple.
Namely, the more control lost by Yeah, I'm gonna write this down too, actually.
That's a good point.
The more control lost by the ego, the more gained by the id.
Resulting in a surprisingly predictable, emotional eruption or breaking point.
Known to Ma and Pa as a good old-fashioned tantrum.
Oh.
Annie.
Why don't you, uh, go and tell our subjects that we're gonna be starting the experiment in five minutes, okay?
And, Annie, it's never actually going to start.
Ha-ha-ha.
I like that, all day.
Hi, everyone.
Hi, Troy.
Hi, Abed.
Hi, Senor Chang.
What, community college Spanish teacher can't use 80 bucks?
Well, we're just running a little bit behind, so we'll probably start in five minutes.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Unacceptable.
When you say something starts at 9, it starts at nueve.
Ah!
No, no.
And we're off.
Did you know we walk the same way after class?
I'm sure you didn't or else we would've been walking together, unless you're a jerk, hmm, just kidding.
Heh-heh.
Let's do it.
Mm-hm.
Don't go too fast for these dogs.
Short legs.
Do you like Green?
What's that?
You got a kid, right?
Nothing.
So Pierce isn't exactly right in the head, is he?
I know a lot of grown men with radar dishes coming out of their ears.
He's like Inspector Gadget.
Yeah, go go gadget incontinence.
How about that guy that's always around flirting with Britta?
I know.
He's the worst, Vaughn?
I know.
What is with his hair?
It's perpetually moist.
Okay, we're three hours in, let's review what we've seen.
And pay close attention to every subject's breaking point.
We've got a shouter.
That one's a stomper.
Bye, hippie.
There's a generic whack job, bouncing up and down like a 6-foot child.
Shaking, write that down.
Visible shakes.
Look at the little one chase the big one, look at them go.
I can make them go quicker, it's like Benny Hill.
Whoo.
Get them.
Lightens the mood.
And back to the present.
And then there were two.
Break, break.
No, no, no.
Annie.
What is going on in there?
I wasted all day here for you.
The Soul Train Awards were tonight.
You promised And he's out.
We got him.
Professor, what is with that last guy?
I've seen this before.
The longer they wait, the harder they break.
Buckle up, students.
Heh.
See how often Hacky Sack takes his shirt off?
He'd play shirts and skins in a game of checkers.
I'm so glad to be able to talk to someone about this.
I wanted to say something to Britta about it.
But we're supposed to be friends now, she'd think I was jealous.
I don't see why you and Britta aren't together.
Two white people going to school together, just seems right.
Shirley, we're not pandas in a zoo.
Oh.
Oh, dear.
That is not what I want to see.
And there goes the shirt.
Hey.
Hey, I'm fine.
Oh.
Want me to, uh, check you for grass stains?
I wasn't sure how or when to bring up that I was hanging out with Vaughn.
I figured that you'd make fun of him and me.
Oh, well Uh First of all, friends don't make fun of each other, even if they're being tackled in the quad by a hippie.
And secondly, Vaughn seems cool.
You guys should hang out sometime.
I gotta go.
I, uh That was tacky out there, you won't ever see that again.
Oh, no worries, brah.
Shirley.
Did you see Senor Chang's socks today?
Tiny bullfighters.
Ha-ha.
I can top that, did you see that Hacky Sack wears an anklet?
Since when won't you talk about Vaughn?
I'm trying to be a good friend to Britta.
She thought I was gonna make fun of him, but I want to be unpredictable.
I'm going to show her that I'm not the jerk she thinks I am.
And friend the hell out of that green-tea-drinking drum circler.
Okay.
But tell me you noticed how small his nipples are.
Not engaging.
What?
It's not gossip when it's fact.
My kids got hamsters with big nips.
No.
Oh, well.
Jeff.
No.
Is Is it on pause?
No, that's just him.
Sorry you've been waiting 26 hours.
It's just going to be another five minutes.
Okey-dokey.
Okey-dokey.
Oh, my Why won't he leave?
Professor.
What?
I'm sorry, this guy's not moving.
I have classes to go to.
Go, fine.
Go kill John Lennon again, you loser.
He's ruined my study.
He's warped the Duncan Principle.
Damn you, you outlying piece of datum.
Ow!
Aah!
It's you.
It's your fault.
But you told me to bring subjects.
Yeah, subjects.
Not Rain Man.
I should never have let you into this lab, Miss Annie Fanny Panties In A Bunch.
Oh.
Oh, that's so hilarious.
Did you think of that the last time you skipped a trip to the dentist?
Oh.
Let me answer that question with another question.
It's not fair.
It's not fair.
What are you doing?
Stop writing.
Put your Give me that.
Get out.
Get out, you bunch of dorks.
Get out.
You have destroyed the Duncan Principle.
Go home.
Cool.
See you.
So, uh, Britta said that you did a lot of community service.
Ultimate Frisbee at the Senior's Center.
It is amazing.
And what makes Frisbee ultimate?
Ha-ha-ha.
Man.
If I had a nickel for every time I wished somebody asked me that.
I'm gonna get dessert.
Want anything?
Carrots.
Oh, I'm good.
Hey, you two.
Hey.
Well, that's a cool shirt.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Where's it from?
Oh.
Uh, psh I don't even know.
I guess it's, well Uh Hey, look at that.
Hanes Classic.
Oh, that's nice.
You know, people underestimate the elderly, but you see these guys out there and they're throwing the 'bee, and they're just loving life.
It's just inspiring.
You know, I'm gonna really I'm gonna think about it.
All right.
I'm gonna check on Brits.
See you.
See you.
You're the devil.
I know.
Plus Okay.
I have a question.
"Where do we go on Saturdays"?
You said, "Sunday".
I have a question for you.
You like Vaughn, right.
Oh, he he's very cute.
I'm just worried that he's thinking a little bit more intensely about this thing than I am.
He says stuff, you know, after School?
After Dinner mints?
After Not having sex.
How was that?
What?
Forget that.
The problem right now is that he's calling me "babe".
He's trying to hold my hands.
It's getting a little relationship-y.
And he gave me something.
Herpes?
No.
This.
A poem?
How do I respond to something like that?
"Thank you"?
Well, it's a very good question.
And it's one I will answer Uh Oh, I'm getting a text.
I'm just gonna read it if you don't mind.
I am reading it and it is read.
Did you ever notice where the ocean meets the sky?
Did ya?
It's the same wizard blue That I see in your eye, Britta Thank you so much.
This has brightened my day.
I'm so glad we can rip on that dude again.
Look at this.
Look at this.
That is the stain of a tear drop over the word, "rad".
Oh, he said rad.
I thought he said red.
That makes it worse.
Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha.
I'm surprised he can read.
You know?
I know.
Hey, sorry about bailing on the psych experiment.
That was the experiment, Troy.
We were testing to see how long people would wait in the room.
Whoa.
Oh.
Gotcha.
"Gotcha"?
That's all you have to say?
Yeah.
You sat in a room for 26 straight hours.
Didn't that bother you?
Yeah, I was livid.
Then why didn't you leave?
Because you asked me to stay and you said we were friends.
Wait.
Is this still part of experiment?
He's more like a puppy with a fish mouth.
Right, right, right.
It's more like this: That's right.
Laugh it up.
Wanna know what they're doing?
Yeah.
Sure.
Making fun of all of us.
I heard you with my own Ear-Noculars.
Pierce, we are not making fun of you.
Ah, ha-ha.
Calling me Hacky Sack, and ripping my My six pack abs and my moist hair.
And that face you made: That was pretty obviously Annie.
Okay, this is definitely still part of the experiment.
Pierce, we were not making fun of you.
We're making fun of Britta's boyfriend, Vaughn.
Oh, good.
Well, in that case, if we're gonna do something, let's do it as a team.
I'll get the ball rolling.
Maybe he has a tiny penis.
Who is this guy?
You all have to got to see him.
Everything's all, "No worries, no worries".
He always says hello three times in a row.
"Hello, good evening, how are you"?
And look, he wrote a poem.
Can I read it?
We shouldn't show that.
No, no, it's fine.
So I'll be done in like an hour?
Yeah, no worries.
He just said it.
Guys, you've met Vaughn, right?
Hey, what's up?
Hi.
Ha-ha.
What a fool.
This group's got a case of the giggles, huh?
Heh.
Wait, is that?
Did you give them my poem?
No.
Okay, well, why's the dinosaur rocking a picture of my poem?
Here, read it.
Ha.
You guys are You guys laughing at me, aren't you?
Yeah.
No.
That's, uh Wow.
This is the least tight thing that's ever happened to me.
I can't believe you.
Honestly, Jeff, how dare you?
I can hear him outside.
He's crying.
Now, he's barking.
Jeff, wait, I'm sorry I sold you out.
Britta is never gonna forgive me.
I can't believe I showed you that poem.
Oh, my God, my life is Degrassi High.
Oh, Jeff.
I have a gossip problem.
I stir the pot, Jeff.
I'm a pot stirrer.
This isn't the only study group I've had this year.
You see those ladies over there?
I used to be in their group until they kicked me out.
They called me Tattle-ina.
It's a bumblebee nickname.
It's cute, but it stings.
Hey, look at the size of that woman's earrings.
It's like little dogs should be jumping through them.
Look at them.
This has to end.
Mm-mm-mm.
Shirley, don't do this.
Look, we can still hang out.
It's just, you know, we won't bag on people.
Come on, Jeff.
What are we gonna talk about?
My kids, your Your doctor career?
I was a lawyer.
See, I'm already bored.
Well We'll always have tiny nipples.
Heh-heh-heh.
They were tiny.
Jeff.
Wait, wait.
I know I shouldn't do this, but one last little piece of gossip.
Britta told me she had a sex dream about you.
You still have a chance.
Mm-mm!
Mm.
Mm-mm.
Details.
Details.
Details.
Abed, here.
I wanted to say sorry for yelling at you.
Indiana Jones, cool.
I just got you the first three because The fourth one blows.
We're cool.
Britta.
I do not want to talk to you.
No, I know, and I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
And I will go talk to Vaughn Vaughn broke up with me.
Oh!
Oh.
You broke my trust.
You suck.
I know and I'm sorry.
But I was in a tough position.
I couldn't handle just being one of the girls.
What do you wanna be?
Is Is there a spot on the friendship spectrum between total stranger and having to hear about the guys you date?
And, ideally, just a notch underneath driving you to the airport and painting your kitchen.
How about the friend level where you sometimes have to cat sit?
Done.
And if I'm occasionally naked in your dreams, I won't complain.
Shirley.
I know, she's got a problem.
She stirs the pot.
She's a pot stirrer.
Sorry, dudes.
No worries, man.
Uh some worries, man.
Some worries.
Whoa.
Shirley would've said something funny about that guy.
Oh, Jeff, oh.
Heh-heh-heh.
Oh, no.
Pierce, Pierce, give me your ear thing.
Got rid of it.
You see, Jeff, there are certain things man was not meant to hear.
We were designed by whatever entity you choose to hear what's in this range.
And really this range alone.
Because, you know who's talking to us in this range.
The people we love.
He must've heard us call him Inspector Gadget.
Oh, I think it's time for Burning Man.
Oh, I'm Saddam Hussein.
Oh.
Nice to meet you, dude.
Oh, wow, I love reading and being a desperate housewife.
Hey, man, coming through, I love the Desperate Housewives.
I'm Dr. Doogie Seacrest.
I think I'm better than everyone else because I'm 40.
I'm not 40.
I can hear you through the window, morons.
Just pretend like you asleep.
Just pretend like you were sleeping.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Good morning, Greendale Community College.
This is your dean reminding you that among your school's prestigious alumni is Mr. Luis Guzmán.
Celebrated actor and model Puerto Rican-American.
This Friday, we will be dedicating a statue of Guzmán, and unveiling our brand-new school song.
So, boy, I don't know about you, but this sure feels like a real college to me.
Greendale, Greendale, Greendale.
Ah.
Jeff, Jeff, good morning.
How is student life, my dry-witted friend?
Probably the same as teacher life, but less tragic because I get to leave.
Very dry, very witty, not a great friend.
Listen, I wanted to ask you about that young lady in your Spanish class.
You know, the blond with the pouty, strident Cate Blanchett sexuality and the ridiculous name.
Britta.
That's it.
That's it.
Imagine living with that.
Can you imagine?
Unbelievable.
Anyway, um, are you two an item?
And if so, would that item be impervious to sabotage?
You know, you have the savoir-faire of a hyena.
How is it that you and James Bond come from the same island?
Message received.
I'll just wait for you to finish striking out first.
Cheers.
M* A*S*H.
Fawlty Towers, game over.
Have a nice day.
You think Luis Guzmán will come to visit his statue?
If so, I'd like to ask him about his movie choices.
Particularly Carlito's Way, The Cowboy Way, The Hard Way and Q&A.
Yeah.
Luis Guzmán is on a private jet from Hollywood because he can't wait to have that conversation with you.
Really?
How does he know about me?
Because he called me on my cell phone.
Why would a movie actor call you?
You don't know?
No.
I'm President Obama's nephew.
You never mentioned that.
I didn't know if I could trust you, but now it's time to tell you everything.
Starting with me inventing the Ferrari.
So I guess the cell phone number you put on the group's contact sheet was fake.
Which I just learned in the conclusion of a month-long text-message affair with a dude from Boulder.
Sorry.
That's okay.
Just give me your real number.
I'll cleanse my palate while Kevin rethinks his marriage.
I'll give you my number if you promise not to use it in any other context than friendship.
Uh Pass.
Star-Burns, that means you.
My name's Alex, dude.
Maybe you should spend five hours sculpting that in your face.
All right, last night I graded your tests.
I'm sure you wanna know how you did, right?
Yes.
Well, I'm not gonna tell you until I find out who did this: What is that?
It's a tiny piece of paper, okay?
That's all it is.
A tiny piece of paper containing all the information covered on the test.
Otherwise known as a crib sheet.
Who did it, huh?
Mary Ann?
Grandpa?
Jackée?
Kumar?
There's one Asian stereotype that does apply to me.
Whoever did this insulted my honor.
And they've got 24 hours to come forward or Mr. Miyagi here will wax off everyone's score and the whole class gets a zero.
Except you, Toby.
The only difference between Señor Chang and Stalin is that I know who Señor Chang is.
You hear him call me Jackée like I'm some black female caricature?
If the good Lord hadn't been watching, I'd have slapped him upside the head.
Who do you guys think cheated?
Flattering, but if I'm gonna cheat, I'm not gonna write information from a book onto paper.
That's practically learning, for God's sake.
Whoever made that crib sheet wasn't a real cheater, just insecure and naive.
I may be naive, but I'm not stupid.
Well, I may be stupid, but I'm not trying to look like I'm not.
Well, I may be a genius, but I'm not a lesbian.
Who cares who made the crib sheet?
The only real cheater is the guy who's threatening everyone with a zero.
You're right.
It's so unfair.
I can't handle this kind of stress right now.
I'm already overwhelmed by my duties on the school song committee.
Are you a musician?
Ew.
No.
I hired a local composer, but he's quite a handful.
Well, I guess that's your fault, isn't it?
It is?
You got an accomplished pianist and songwriter sitting three feet away from you.
I wrote the jingle for Hawthorne Wipes towelettes.
I would've done your song for free.
Smooth move, Metamucil.
Troy could do the school song.
Troy invented rap music.
And he's related to Danny Glover and President Obama.
Abed, have you been racist this whole time while I'm telling everybody at church what a sweet little caramel angel you are?
Hey man, that stuff I said this morning wasn't true.
I was just messing with you.
You were lying?
Yeah, as a joke.
You You never had somebody mess with you before?
Yes, just kidding.
No, like that?
This isn't a table.
Ha-ha-ha.
That's funny.
Remember when we used to study Spanish?
Pierce.
Yo.
I talked to the dean and he said you can write Greendale's school song.
Well, that's more like it.
You know, the statue dedication is this Friday, so have it done by then.
This Friday?
This Friday?
If that's not enough time No, no, no.
You really don't know much about genius, do you?
Yes, I can do it by Friday.
Great.
There's a piano in the rehearsal space and I'll help you out however I can.
You're gonna do an awesome job.
I know!
So this is the last chance for the cheater to be an adult and face la música or everyone fails.
No.
You've got 10 seconds, starting now.
No!
I've never gotten a zero before.
I did it.
Britta?
Wow.
You really took your sweet time with that one.
How dare you terrorize a class by threatening their grades?
It's not that easy to get human beings to turn on each other.
Turn on her.
Real mature.
God, Britta.
That's right, we are mature.
Too mature to sit in a class with a cheating, lying, poop face.
Okay, time to learn some formal greetings.
So, wow.
Yeah, I bet you're enjoying this.
Yeah, well, when we first met, like, you were up here and I was here.
And now Oh, wait, I gave a quarter to a dirty bum today.
What do you think they're gonna do to me?
Well, we're not gonna buy you an ice cream.
Hi, Dean Pelton.
Heh.
Quite an entrance I got to make there.
You would be Britta Perry?
I just spoke with Señor Chang.
And I'm afraid Greendale takes this kind of thing very seriously.
Much like a university would.
Your case will be reviewed by disciplinary tribunal tomorrow in Borchart Hall.
You could be facing expulsion.
Isn't Borchart Hall the pool?
There is an Olympic-sized pool there, yes.
But we will be next to it, using its $6000 judge's table.
Uh, is she allowed to have counsel?
I mean, I may not be a practicing lawyer anymore, but relative to this place, I'm Alan Dershowitz.
Oh.
Okay, ouch.
And, yes, if you'd like, you may represent her.
Dean you later.
I'm not gonna sit while some hokey tribunal gets its jollies judging me.
Hey, if you show up with me, follow my lead, and deny everything, you'll walk.
That's the Winger guarantee.
I get it.
You think you're gonna save my bacon using your lawyer powers and send me into fits of grateful arousal.
I can neither confirm nor deny that.
See how good I am?
Hey, Troy, did you hear?
All dogs are blue now.
Every single dog in the world is blue.
I'm just messing with you.
Yeah.
I know.
But let me explain to you a few things about how this works.
Okay.
First of all, I cannot be got.
Mm-hm.
Because I am not gullible like you.
Secondly, you are not good at this, because you are not believable in your face, okay?
Your face?
Yeah?
It's bad.
Um Okay.
Also, you gotta ride the line between believable and What are you writing in?
It's a notepad.
Yeah, but what What language?
It's probably Arabic.
All right, uh, I am convening this disciplinary tribunal at our state-of-the-art judge's table.
Which has it's own built-in sound system.
So take that, Yale.
Heh-heh.
Our judges include, uh, myself, uh, Dean Craig Pelton.
Professor lan Duncan.
Professor Ben Chang.
Uh, no, you're a teacher, you're not a professor.
Well, maybe because I don't look like Ron Weasley.
That's the difference, that's the qualifying factor.
Gentlemen, point of order.
How can Señor Chang be one of the judges?
He's the one accusing my client.
You got Prince Charles over here as your drinking buddy.
Oh, got me.
Well, it sounds like there are two biases, one on each side.
And I go both ways.
Oh, let's strike that.
LaShonda, can we please strike that?
I am impartial, so it should all work out.
Okay, let's begin.
Fine.
Uh, the tribunal calls teacher Chang.
Okay, just keep it up, FrostlNixon.
I was planning on doing that.
Cleared my whole day.
Uh, Mr. Chang, could you remind us of the events of yesterday?
Oh, with great pleasure.
It was a Tuesday, uh, crack of dawn, 5:58 a.m. I got up, I took my morning deuce.
I made a breakfast consisting of # Greendale, Greendale # # Slop pail # Oh, man.
Green, green, green.
# Greendale isn't a slop pail ## Hi.
I'm almost done.
Oh, good.
You can tell the dean you will have a song that'll make the devil poop God's pants.
That's exciting.
Mind if I hear what you got so far?
Well, yeah, sure, I, uh I'll probably open with something like this.
Uh You know, a note like that.
And end with a note like that.
The words, I can't tell you.
You know, the rest is really a surprise.
I'm just a little worried.
I keep hearing the same two notes.
And your sheet music looks like a Chinese takeout menu.
A musician sees music in everything, Annie.
I mean, it could be # Moo shu pork # # Squab with lettuce ## You see?
I mean, it just comes out.
You really shouldn't be here right now.
What?
You are inside a throbbing, cosmic womb of creativity.
And when this baby starts kicking, I cannot be responsible for your sanity.
Ha.
I know it sounds funny, but let me play you out, okay?
Playing you out now, this song.
You know, like on stage?
Playing you out, okay?
Thanks for coming.
Bye-bye.
Then she yelled, "Screw you".
Or, "Screw education".
Or something like that.
Then she stormed out of the room in her high-heel boots like it was tampon time.
If you know what I mean.
Objection.
I don't know what he means.
Please don't encourage him.
Do you have any more questions?
The defense calls Britta Perry.
Now are those the high-heel boots he was talking about?
Yes.
Are they comfortable?
Yeah.
I'm just curious.
They're cute.
Miss Perry, did you make that crib sheet?
No.
She confessed.
She confessed to protect her classmates because you were threatening to flunk everyone.
You did what?
Oh.
Shut your pompous vortex of overlapping fangs.
Hey, British dentistry is not on trial.
Dean Pelton, I move this case be thrown out of the pool area.
Well, it certainly Well, it certainly sounds to me that this young lady's only crime is being a hero and wanting to be taller.
This tribunal is adjourned.
Wait, I cheated.
And we're back.
Objection.
My client did not cheat.
Yes, I did.
Yes, she did.
But why?
That's the real question, isn't it?
The world wasn't the only thing that changed on September 11 th.
Oh, Jeff, come on.
Five minute recess?
No, no.
There's nothing in the bylaws about recesses, all right?
The wheels of justice here don't stop just because Oh!
I know, everyone, time out, time out.
Save the table, save the table.
Beginning transmission.
The primary purpose seems to be male bonding.
And the attitude during conveyance of the random deceit is apparently of great importance.
The humanoid is approximately What are you doing?
Oh, hey, Troy.
I didn't see you.
Uh How long were you standing there?
You trying to mess with me?
Yes.
That's what I was doing.
You got me.
I was just messing with you, but I guess I blew it again.
Heh-heh.
Yeah, you did.
Don't turn your back on me, thinking you're all hoity-toity.
Have you got a problem with me?
I don't like the fact that you're walking around here, like you're better than me, in front of my students.
I'm sorry, do you mind if we have this conversation in a room with less balls?
You You're very confident, I'll say that.
But you shouldn't be.
What are you doing out there?
You know I have a problem with dishonesty.
You're on trial for cheating.
Fine.
Look, we'll be fine.
I just have go back out there and make the case that you're a good person.
You don't know that.
You're just doing all this because you wanna sleep with me.
I mean you said it yourself, you don't even wanna be my friend.
Wait a minute, wait.
Is that Is that what you thought I meant?
Britta, look at me.
Look at me.
I am.
No, look how handsome my face is.
If all I wanted was sex, I could get it from plenty of women without having to go through all this crap.
I'm here because I like you.
And I'd I'd be psyched to be your friend.
I just didn't wanna take sex off the table without doing my due diligence.
I actually believe you.
Well, why wouldn't you?
I don't know.
I guess the same reason that I cheated.
I just have more experience being worthless.
I think I left that crib sheet on the floor because I wanted to get caught at it.
I'm so used to screwing everything up, I just wanted to get it over with.
Wait.
I think we have our defense.
Gentlemen, my client is insane.
What?
Gentlemen, I'm sure you suspected that Miss Perry was pretty odd before the recess.
But if you could've heard all the stuff she just told me in the shower, you would realize she is all the way out of her entire damn mind.
She doesn't want to succeed because she doesn't think she can.
So she goes out of her way to fail.
That's crazy.
But do we really wanna make it a crime to be crazy at Greendale?
I mean, look at us.
I mean, you two are arguing about status at a college that correspondence schools make fun of.
Dean, you want so bad for this place to be Ivy League that you are putting us at risk of electrocution.
Because everyone on this campus is nuts.
Not me.
Oh, come on, Leonard.
If you're gonna argue with me, put on a bathing suit.
Busted.
Ha-ha-ha.
If you wanna rehabilitate your fellow inmate, you need to sentence her to staying here with us.
Because if crazy people can't be at Greendale, where are we supposed to go?
Wow.
Well, under the circumstances, I recommend that the accused be fully exonerated.
On the condition that she receives psychological counseling on a weekly basis from a trained mental health professional.
I'm thinking maybe Fridays, All in favor say "aye".
Aye.
Yes.
Wait.
What?
That just happened.
Greetings, Abed.
Greetings, Abed.
Greetings, commander.
Tell me about the one they call Troy.
Well, he is rather arrogant and has no mercy for weaker beings.
Stop.
Stop doing this right now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm not an alien.
Ha-ha.
I never thought you were.
But this is insane, okay?
Those are credible alien hand movements.
You invented a whole language.
I'm pretty sure you rented a green screen.
Yeah.
It would be less creepy if you were actually an alien.
But this is what friends do.
No.
It From now on, Abed, friends don't mess with each other.
Okay, cool?
Cool, cool.
Bang-bang.
Garrett, it's over.
He knows.
You're getting a little sloppy.
We went over budget.
I've got it.
# Greendale, Greendale, little star # Oh.
I can't Reject.
I'm a fraud, Annie.
I'm no more of a songwriter than you or Billy Joel.
But what about the Hawthorne Wipes jingle?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sure, the whole thing.
You wanna hear it?
Here.
# You'll be wiping off that ketchup With our wipes # # Hawthorne Wipes # # You'll be wiping off that mustard With our wipes # # At the picnic ## That's "She'll be Comin' Around the Mountain".
I know.
I steal everything.
You backed the wrong horse.
I got nothing.
Pierce, you're musical.
You're creative, you can do this.
I believe in you.
Well, you shouldn't.
I quit.
You listen up, Pierce.
I'm gonna tell you what my mother told me when I wanted to quit cheerleading.
"You're not very pretty, you have no boobs, and you can't do a basket toss to save your life, but you made a commitment".
So pick up your pom-poms, Pierce.
Stuff your bra, and get ready for the team bus to forget you at a Taco Bell because life is tough.
But we soldier on, and that's just the way it goes.
I'm gonna play myself out.
"The way it goes".
That's it.
One, two, Luis Guzmán.
Oh!
Oh.
Oh.
All right, Luis.
You know, Greendale may never be Harvard Don't talk to me for a while.
No problem.
Just glad you're here.
With that, I'd like to introduce our student, Pierce Hawthorne, who's written Greendale its own school song.
Heh.
Pierce, okay.
Thank you, dean, thank you.
This song goes out to Annie for believing in me.
# Standing in the bookstore line Waiting for the bell to chime # # So you can go to class # # Dancing in your underwear Taking air conditioner repair # Is this Bruce Hornsby's?
Yup.
Does he know he stole it?
I don't think so.
Let him enjoy it.
Could we get sued?
Not sure.
# Greendale's the way it goes # Yeah, they got us.
# Some things are still the same # # Slop pails and pantyhose # # Oh, Annie believes in me ## How many?
Thirty-six.
You win.
Best of three?
Yeah.
Aaah
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
A small, fading remnant of a star.
A white dwarf.
That's right.
I used a memory technique.
Dwarves hate being called midgets, and midgets are small.
Good.
And what does a star turn into after it collapses?
A movie of the week.
A black hole.
Right.
Troy, you could be an astronomer.
As far as I'm concerned, there's only one black hole worth studying.
It's called Sagittarius A. It's located in the center of our galaxy and it has the density of 40 suns.
Just like my wiener.
Ha-ha.
You said "wiener".
That's funny.
Pierce and Troy didn't get along at first but now they're bonding through mutual adolescence.
Shut up, fart head.
Will you shut up, poo-poo head?
Hi, everybody.
Ha-ha.
Well, look at this group.
Having some kind of meeting and being so diverse.
There is just Boy, there is just one of every kind of you, isn't there?
Well, we are missing a pipsqueak but we don't want one, so beat it.
Uh, Pierce, that's the dean.
You kidding?
Sorry.
Just my luck.
It's all right.
Don't let me interrupt.
Sometimes, I just roll around campus like a little football.
I can't believe this.
Here I am in a random conversation about football, and I'm talking to Troy Barnes, star quarterback from Riverside High.
Whoa.
Heh.
Troy, did you know Greendale has a football team?
Did you know they had a football?
Ah.
Heh.
Good.
That's very funny.
Troy, I was so sorry to hear about your injury, but now that you have recovered, we would love for you to play for the Human Beings.
The team's name is the Human Beings?
Yeah.
My idea.
It was the Greendale Grizzlies but I thought that, um Well, a lot of these students have been called animals their whole lives.
Unfortunately, I don't know what to do about the mascot.
Oh.
I could help with that, Your Honor.
I have a wealth of experience in image management, icon development, and Y2K preparedness.
Ooh.
Well, aren't you found money.
Heh-heh.
Troy, all of your friends are lining up to turn Greendale around.
How about you?
Troy isn't interested in football anymore.
Getting injured in that keg stand was the best thing that ever happened to him.
Whoa.
Yoko Ono much?
Ha-ha-ha.
Bros before ho's, Troy.
Heh.
Listen, man, no offense, but I was the best and I finished on top.
I wouldn't play for this school with a 10-foot pole.
Dean, I'm sure Troy will sign up for football, if and when some accident damages the part of his brain that feels pride.
Until then, would you excuse us?
All right.
Well, uh, if you change your mind, the field is always open.
Oh, figuratively speaking.
You know.
Wednesdays and Sundays it's used as parking overflow for the megachurch.
Okay.
Heh.
Now let's meet the minimum requirements for a language credit, shall we?
Yes, but I need to go to the bathroom first.
Uh, Britta?
Oh, no, I don't have to go.
I'll go with you.
What?
She's offended?
Girls go in groups.
Did you learn nothing from standup comedy in the '90s?
I'm familiar with the concept, I just Uh Fine.
If it's important to Shirley, I'll go next time.
I'm willing to try some more mainstream feminine stuff.
Then you should know nothing says, "I'm a woman" like doing it with me.
Nothing says, "I'm a pig," like you.
Will they or won't they?
Sexual tension.
Abed.
It makes the group uncomfortable when you talk like we're characters in a show you're watching.
Well, that's sort of my gimmick.
But we did lean on that pretty hard last week.
I can lay low for an episode.
Are you sure you made the right call on the football team, Troy?
It looks like they won something once.
"Most Valued Customer, Henderson Trophy Cases".
We should still study a little more astronomy later, right?
Maybe over some Milky Ways or some Mars bars.
Or pancakes.
"I'm Jeff and I'm a student at Greendale"?
Well, that's not good.
Wood undergoes rapid oxidation because it reacts spontaneously to Okay, guys.
Seriously.
We've talked about this.
Okay, you have got to turn off your cell ph That's mine.
My bad.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Would you like to come with me?
Well, yes.
Yes, I would.
That's nice.
Okay, what's it called?
Antoni?
Hold on.
Does anybody have a pen?
A pen?
No one has a pen.
Why would you not bring a pen to class?
Idiot.
No, you're not an idiot.
Ha-ha-ha.
I had my blinker on about five minutes and this no-good, "clearly bald but trying to hide it with a bandana" loser swooped right in.
I couldn't believe it.
Maybe he didn't see you.
He saw me.
Maybe he had his blinker on too.
Maybe.
So you got any family, Britta?
Yeah.
Whatever.
My mom might visit this weekend.
She and I are gonna get makeovers at that spa Makeovers.
They sure have us programmed right.
I am a female pleasure unit.
I require a new coat of paint.
Just something I thought might be fun.
Here's something I think might be fun.
Let's find out the number of makeup companies that are owned by women.
I'll save you the trouble.
It's zero.
Of course, you're saying, "Britta, aren't you a hypocrite?
You're plastered with glitter and goo from head to toe like the rest of us".
Well, I also pay income tax and pull over for cops.
But that doesn't mean I support a country that oppresses citizens, restricts voting rights Thanks for offering to help design the new mascot.
I, uh, have been a little stumped.
Heh.
That's no problem.
By the way, I took the liberty of thumbnailing a Human Being prototype, uh, which I modeled after Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.
Oh.
You're offering it but The penis is a little small, I think.
Oh, okay.
It looks a lot like you.
Okay.
Um, here's the thing.
If we are the Human Beings, you know, and we have a mascot that's just a white guy, what message are we sending?
Our symbol needs to reflect the diversity of our school and our species.
So, black?
No, because we're not the Greendale Blacks, Mr. Hawthorne, or the Greendale Asians, or any other creed.
We are the Greendale Human Beings.
Yeah.
Sorry to disturb you guys.
Who are clearly looking at a clearly naked drawing of Pierce doing jumping jacks.
Dean, a quick download, please?
Uh Absolutely.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Fill me in later.
Whoa-oh.
Ah.
Good, a pencil.
First of all, I'm flattered.
Oh, well, you're a very photogenic man.
Is that real bed head, or do you put something in there?
Can I?
Oh.
It's crispy.
I was thinking about the four disembodied heads and I thought, Where's the heart?
Where's the soul?
Where's the different poster design?
You know I did think those were less than personable.
Which is why I went with the full bodies in these mailers we have going out.
Ta-ta-ta.
Mailers?
I didn't give permission for this.
Jeffrey, did you not read the release agreement on the back of your registration form?
Heh-heh-heh.
I'm starting to see why someone used to be a lawyer.
Ha-ha-ha.
Look, if someone from the outside were to find Okay, if someone from the outside were to find out that I am a student at a community college, that could have a negative impact on my future career.
Oh.
Goodness.
Look what we have stumbled onto.
An opportunity to help each other out.
I suppose I wouldn't need this promotional campaign if I could announce to the press that Troy Barnes is playing football here.
I think he's been pretty clear about declining that offer.
I think if you said jump, he'd say, "How high"?
If you said stop, he'd say "Hammer time".
You starting to get what I mean?
Hmm?
No, I need another example.
You know, I didn't realize before, but we should send those out to local businesses.
Law firms, lawyer companies, legal gatherings.
You trying to blackmail me?
I think so.
Gentlemen, I present to you the Greendale Human Being.
That's a falcon with a gun.
Now it's a falcon with an erection.
Oh, hi, Abed.
Hmm.
Bye.
He's just laying low.
Oh, are you going to the bathroom?
Uh Yes.
I'll go with you.
You know what?
I'm good.
She probably just, you know, had to go number two.
Okay, what's the closest planet to Earth?
Planet Hollywood?
Ha-ha-ha.
That's not the right answer but it shows how fun astronomy can be.
Hey, Troy, can I talk to you for a sec?
We're studying, so Troy's busy.
Well, the galaxy's not going anywhere.
I'll bring him back.
You ever miss being a quarterback, Troy?
I miss being the best at something.
I miss having a coach.
I miss knowing what to think.
You still know what to think, Troy.
Oh, good.
For instance, after the dean talked to you about football, you and I were thinking the same thing.
That dude looks like Moby.
We were thinking, what if Troy did play for Greendale?
You'd be surprised at how many of your favorite football players got started at community college.
Really?
Name one.
Who's your favorite player?
Me.
Whoa.
Maybe you and I should go check out the Greendale Thunderdome.
The dome arrives later.
It comes with thunder.
Let me tell you a little secret about me, Troy.
Every day, on my way to school, I drive through downtown, past the courthouse, just to get a glimpse of the world that I once ruled.
And I just wanna jump out of my car, run up the steps, and exploit the legal system for profit.
But I can't.
I'm locked out of my old kingdom.
You're not.
You see what I'm saying?
You're saying I could be a lawyer.
I'm saying you're a football player.
It's in your blood.
That's racist.
Your soul.
That's racist.
Your eyes?
That's gay?
That's homophobic.
That's black.
That's racist.
Damn.
When you played, you were a god.
Now you're not playing and you're not.
I'd tell you to do the math, but math isn't important.
The only thing that's important is this.
Yeah, but Annie said Annie said that Benjamin Button was compelling.
Look, she's a smart girl but sometimes she's just wrong.
Eighty-five, go long.
It's like a drug, isn't it?
Feel it, Troy.
Throw it.
The scoreboard lights up.
There will be a scoreboard there.
It's complete.
Nice catch.
The girls, the glory, the scouts, the career.
It starts when you join this team.
Is that linebacker a pregnant woman?
Look, you can meet them later, but this decision has to be yours, T-Bone.
And this decision has to be yes.
How did you know my nickname was T-Bone?
Because you're a football player and your name begins with T. Your name begins with T. Britta?
Oh, are you finished?
I mean, I have to go, but apparently, I failed yesterday's tryouts for the position of bathroom companion.
Oh, Britta, I wasn't trying to hurt your feelings.
Heh.
You didn't hurt my feelings, Shirley.
I don't need to go to the bathroom with other people.
I was just trying to throw you a bone because I like you.
Oh.
You can keep that bone.
Listening to a story about a stranger pissing me off and taking the stranger's side?
And then you can't talk about your own business but you insinuate my mama's a robot because she and I want makeovers.
That is the ladies room, Britta.
A place where ladies go to share, listen, support each other, and discretely eliminate waste.
And I like you too.
I even like that you're a little hard, but if you can't learn to be soft in there, you need to pee alone.
I've peed alone my whole life.
Women have always hated me.
I don't even know how it started.
Maybe it was when I got boobs before everybody Shhh.
Not out here.
In there.
Whoo!
Ha-ha.
Troy, Troy, the wonder boy.
You dropped your books, Poindexter.
Heh-heh-heh.
Troy, I've been waiting for an hour.
It's all right.
I'm worth it.
# Hip hop, body don't stop # # Riverside got the broom Don't need a mop # # Put your team in a box Put a ribbon on top # # We're not John Kerry Because we don't flip flop ## Troy, why are you doing our politically conservative high school's shamefully outdated fight rap?
Have you been playing football?
Threw the skin around a couple of times.
I still got it.
Uhn, uhn, uhn.
Doosh!
Uhn.
But you knew we had an Astronomy test tomorrow.
Class blows.
What I need to know about the universe is that I'm at the center of it.
# Oh Bing, bong, sing along # # Your team's Al Gore Your views are wrong ## Troy, stop.
Don't become this person again.
This isn't the real you.
This is the arrogant jock that totally ignored the only people that truly liked him for non-superficial reasons but weren't allowed to say anything because their parents are bigots.
Huh?
Football is bad for you, Troy.
Jeff said you'd say that.
Jeff What now?
Troy.
Troy, Troy, Troy.
That's my name.
I think if we add in a little bit of Phylicia Rashad, we'll be in better shape.
Yeah, you're right.
That beige is a little light.
Um Wow.
Yeah, yeah.
We are developing the perfect mascot.
No stereotypical identifiers from any race or gender.
You see, Jeff, this is a chart of the features we're staying away from.
Pan-Asian eye folds, uh, Irish chins, women's breasts.
Is that Seal?
Oh, that is our human color wheel.
It goes from Seal to Seal's teeth.
What do you think?
I think not being racist is the new racism.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened to the prototype?
Ooh.
I left the nose in the kiln.
Oh.
So Troy is gonna play football.
Yes.
Which means I'll be getting rid of these.
No, uh, I won't mail these out but they are staying with me until the press announces that Troy is a part of the team.
And I want him at that pep rally tonight.
Reporters are gonna be there.
We're gonna unveil the new mascot and things are finally going to start turning around.
Oh, and my ex-therapist is gonna think twice before he makes fun of my job!
Here it is.
Still hot.
Ooh.
Ow.
Oh, Dean, I'm gonna get some more coffee.
You want anything?
Yeah, uh, a Desmond Tutu with just enough cream to make it a Lou Diamond Phillips.
La Bamba.
Got it.
Aha!
I've been following you.
How much did the dean pay you to make Troy play football?
I'm not having a conversation with someone who emerges from a bush.
Because I'm right?
No.
Because I'm not in a commercial for breakfast cereal.
Look, the dean has pictures of me, okay?
Horrible pictures of me.
Attending his school.
And for that, you've convinced Troy to flush his life down football's toilet again?
Britta's right.
You are the most selfish person alive.
And all that is gonna end right now.
I'm telling him what kind of friend you really are.
Maybe you should tell him you're hopelessly in love with him.
High school must have been tough, huh?
Waiting for a superstar to notice you.
But here, here, he's all alone and he needs so much help.
Did you enroll in all his classes or were you worried that might freak him out?
The important thing is that you are there for him.
The important thing is that you are the only one there for him.
And you don't really care what he wants, just as long as you don't have to share him with the world.
Because, really, you are just as selfish as I am.
You're just not as good at it yet.
You're right.
I could never be as good as you.
Probably because I actually care.
Profound but technically meaningless.
And don't bother trying that thing women do where they walk away and make the guy feel like crap, because it won't happen.
Yeah.
Damn it.
Shirley, will you please come to the bathroom with me?
Where's Shirley?
Shirley's not coming.
But, uh, I'm here to listen, girl.
Why do we inflict so much pain on ourselves for men?
I don't know, sweetie.
Maybe it's because men make the world go around?
Kleenex?
I've been infatuated with Troy.
Now he's joining football.
Now he'll have his pick of the litter and I'll never get to be with him.
Oh, Annie, screw him.
There are guys out there that would kill to be with you.
If Troy isn't one of them, that's him failing your standards.
You got that?
You're right.
I can't control him.
And if I truly cared about him, I wouldn't want to.
Thanks for talking to me, Britta.
It really helped.
Seriously?
Yes.
Who's my girl?
Excuse me.
I did it.
I did it.
Yes, you did.
Human Beings, Human Beings, Human Beings.
Human Beings, Human Beings.
Troy.
Troy.
Don't go in there, man.
What?
You got the most you were ever going to get out of football in high school.
A life of disillusionment and depression begins on the other side of that door.
Hey, man, is this your first pep rally or something?
You told me football was the most important thing in the world.
Well, buckle up, Troy I was exaggerating.
It's kind of my gimmick.
Let me tell you something.
No, let me tell you something.
You know that keg flip that cost me my scholarship?
Yeah.
I hurt myself on purpose.
What?
There was a scout coming to the final game at Riverside and I couldn't take the pressure.
So I took the easy way out.
When you showed me that field, I saw there was nothing to worry about here.
I could just play football for the fun of it.
I mean, have you seen these guys?
There is nowhere to go but up.
Dude, we have feelings.
I don't know about you, but I know I ended up here because things weren't that great out there.
You should try accepting where you're at, man.
Take a pottery class or something.
# Greendale, we're number one Nancy Pelosi is no fun ## Hey.
Hey.
I've decided to support Troy.
They deploy things in football.
I went for rhyme over clarity.
Look, I'm, uh I'm really sorry about before.
I just think we were both wrong.
Really?
Because I'm an 18-year-old girl and you made me cry in public.
Hmm.
Okay, maybe I was a little more wrong.
I should grow up and make peace with being here.
I mean, it's not like Greendale is gonna kill me or anything.
Holy crap.
Oh!
Sorry.
Hey, say hello to our ethnically neutral mascot, the Greendale Human Being.
The costume makes it difficult for him to see.
He can't move his mouth either.
But take it from me, that's human for "hello".
Let's get you into the pep rally.
Great idea.
Let's do it.
We've solved racism.
What's next?
Let's do something for little people.
Or albinos.
How about little albinos?
Well, this has the potential to be a uniquely Greendale experience.
My lady?
My lord.
Attention, students, this is Abed.
And the disco spider.
Here at Greendale.
Greendale.
Say what?
A few quick announcements.
Announcement number one.
All announcements will be cool, starting right now.
Announcement number two, butt soup.
Announcement number three, I am not Hadji from Jonny Quest, Jeff Winger.
On security news, you guys gotta start locking the dean's door so guys like us don't get in.
Hey.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
As you know, all faculty at Greendale are required to give extra credit to students who organize academically-related events during what would otherwise be known as our "free time".
No student in any department has ever exercised this option until now.
Tonight, in the library, I will be hosting a Día de los Muertos party.
Just relax, just relax.
Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is sometimes referred to as Mexican Halloween.
Which is actually quite offensive to people familiar with Mexican Halloween as a sexual position.
At any rate, if you show up, you get extra credit.
Me, I don't even get paid.
See you tonight.
Um, heh, heh.
Most of you responded to my Evite, but some of you remain evasive, so Count me in.
This is my first college party.
I got some tequila, and I just rented Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj, and look.
Shirley, you took off your wedding ring.
My husband's been gone for six months.
So I think it's time for me to embrace being single.
Message received.
I'm still waiting to hear from Jeff and Pierce.
Oh, I thought I shot you a response from this pocket phone here.
Access e-mail.
You're not going to Annie's party?
Oh, I have a conflict.
It conflicts with the enjoyment of my life.
I cannot figure out the voice command part of this thing.
It's like I'm my mother.
Calling mother.
What?
Speaking of enjoying life, I don't wanna beat a dead horse here, but are you sure you don't see anything non-platonic ever crystallizing between us?
I'm sure.
Okay, good.
Because one of my professors is really hot.
And I wanted to give you first right of refusal.
Hello?
Pierce?
Mom?
How's school going?
Are you popular?
I am headed through a tunnel right now.
Wrong number.
Has that boy Jeff stopped teasing you?
How's your Canadian girlfriend?
I saw your father's ghost again.
He's still angry.
The Bernoulli Distribution is the number of successes in a sequence of independent yes-no experiments.
Okay.
For the quiz Monday brush up on chapters three and four.
Bernoulli's one of my favorites.
Little known fact, statistics were not his only love.
He's famous for his French sauce used on meat and poultry.
That's béarnaise.
We may need to settle this at a restaurant.
That's cute.
A little aggressive.
But as a busy, confident woman of authority I'm attracted to men who take charge.
You being sarcastic or am I nailing it?
You were nailing it until you had to ask.
Oh, damn it.
Starting over.
Hey, you in the skirt, date me.
I'd like to, Mr. Winger.
You're tall, dress nice.
I've graded enough of your tests to know I'd never feel mentally inadequate.
Thank you.
Only problem, I don't date students.
You know, if you agree to go Oh.
Hey.
Awkward.
How small is this campus?
Bastard.
It's fine, I don't care.
It's disgusting the way men behave.
You ever see that Katherine Heigl movie poster, where Gerard Butler had that heart over his wiener?
That resonated with me.
Okay, fine.
But just to repeat, I don't care what Jeff does.
Bastard.
I'm barely a student.
I'm older than you, I drive a Lexus.
I saw Ghost Busters in the theater.
Look, my gums are receding.
It's uncanny how many of my buttons you're finding, but I have a personal rule about this and I stick to it.
Have a cup of coffee with me, I can change your mind.
I know you can.
That's why you're not getting the chance.
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo.
Are you coming to my party?
I'm definitely gonna try to swing by.
Then I can mark you down as definitely being there from 7:00 sharp until question mark?
Here's the thing No, here's the thing.
I am putting my foot down, do you understand?
I am being assertive, and I am making eye contact, and it is achieving results.
Trying to get formidable with me?
It worked on Pierce.
Infomercials work on Pierce.
Jeff, you're the cool guy, okay?
If you show up, it will be the first party I host where everyone doesn't say they need to get home in time for the news.
This won't work.
The last time you did this, I saved a vial of your tears.
And I've been slowly building up an immunity.
I was so unpopular in high school, the crossing guard used to lure me into traffic.
This party is a second chance at being hip, cool, laid-back.
Look, I will come to your party.
Thank you.
I'm putting you down for two bags of ice and a sleeve of paper cups.
Taking a pill?
Yes, I am.
"Xenolovaden".
My grandpa took that around your age.
Fantastic.
Helped him with his going problem.
By the time Grandpa got up in years, his memory wasn't great.
He'd mix the wrong pills.
You know how old people are.
Heard stories about it.
One time he started hallucinating and ran down the street with no pants on, which in the Gaza Strip is considered a real party foul so you should probably be careful.
Look, I really don't need your advice, and I'm not your pantsless grandpa.
Heh.
"Pantsless grandpa".
Heh, heh.
Scary.
You look great.
Hi.
Britta, you look adorable.
Thank you.
I hate when women use Halloween as an excuse to dress up like sluts, you know?
Yeah.
Okay, everyone.
I think we can begin.
I've got everyone's personalized cookie tombstones, por tradición.
And, in a few minutes we're going to start the Dance of the Dead, La Danza de los Muertos.
You don't have to keep doing that.
Party on.
Nice of you to be here, I'm sure you'd rather be out with your hot professor.
Well, it's funny.
I enrolled here as a selfish Ioner.
But you and the group have given me a crash course in friendship.
She blew you off, huh?
She's grading papers.
Professor Slater?
She's not grading papers, she's at the faculty party in the cafeteria.
Oh, look.
It's the eavesdropping matador.
Are you saying my people are sneaky?
What?
There is a storm building on the horizon, but you and I will save the night.
Chex mix, pretzels, baby carrots.
Predictable but appetizing.
Hey.
Hey.
Can I ask you something that I always wanted to ask real Batman?
Am I good-looking?
You're a very attractive young man.
I knew it.
Let's get this party started.
Who are you?
I am the Beastmaster.
From the movie, Beastmaster.
What rock have you been living under?
What are you going as?
A gay douche bag?
Just kidding.
Nice one.
I'm not much of a costume guy.
You're not much of a liking-ladies guy either.
Oh.
Body blow.
Is that liquor?
Hello.
Here's your drinks, mates.
Oh.
Thanks, Urkel.
I'm Harry Potter.
Really?
What up, Urkel?
Hey.
All right.
What are you taking?
Huh?
Oh.
You know, the usual cool stuff.
I've got ludes, dreamers, Johnny Boys.
Tell you what, I'll I'll trade you one of mine for two of yours.
I don't know, Star-Burns, I'm Oh, sorry.
I thought I was dealing with the Beastmaster.
Hey.
Who said you weren't?
Heh, heh, heh.
Saddle up, fruit pie.
Don't mind if I do.
May I?
Here, take this.
Give anyone that shows up their stupid credit.
You going to the faculty party?
Make me your plus one.
Give it up, Winger.
Professor Slater doesn't date students.
Or married Asians who drive mopeds.
I'll give you 20 bucks.
I'll bring the hog around.
Okay, it's time for the Dance of the Dead.
Everyone form a circle.
Lights.
Music.
Is it under genre or on a specific play list?
Hey, man, what'd you slip me?
I keep grinding my teeth and I wanna kiss everybody.
What did you slip me, man?
My heart stopped racing and I can't pee.
Now, for the first dance, I would like to invite a very special guest to the floor.
Jeff Winger?
Jeff?
Where's Jeff?
Please slow down.
Please.
Stop crying, Winger.
Watch it!
Is Jeff gone?
You know, I'm gonna go.
I don't wanna miss the news.
News.
He just stepped out.
He's gonna be right back.
He's going to the faculty party.
To be with Professor Short Skirt?
We hate her.
No, it's not about her, Shirley.
I can't believe that Jeff would do this to Annie.
Yes, absolutely, it's about Annie.
We should go find that bitch's car and snap off her antenna.
It's like high school all over again.
Everyone's leaving.
Not me.
I can do this all night.
I love you.
There you go, pretty lady.
What are you doing here?
Showing you my non-student side.
I have to admit, this outfit is doing it for me.
I may or may not have been deflowered by a junior rodeo champion.
You remind me of my first time too.
You lost your virginity to Robin Hood?
No, with an attractive woman at a party.
We seem destined to repeat history.
I told you, no students.
It's unseemly.
I go out with you, you tell your friends.
What friends?
I have no friends, I hate everyone here but you.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
You should be over at the library with Annie.
Whoa.
Yippee ki-yay.
Thought you weren't a costume guy.
Had to have one to get in, squirrel.
Oh.
So where did you get it?
I wouldn't think any costume stores would be open this late.
I don't know what you're getting at.
The words you're looking for are, "I own a cowboy outfit".
And it is tight too.
Did you buy it like that?
Your toy gun to my head, I'd say yes.
Hi, Michelle Slater, PhD.
Britta Perry, GED.
Oh, are you a classmate of Jeff's?
When you say classmate, it sounds like we take naps together and eat paste.
What's great about community college is is that a lot of the students are as mature as the teachers.
Jeff, you must return to Annie's party.
She's feeling unpopular.
Jeff, Pierce took something and he is tripping balls.
He's touching people and dancing weird.
It's like Grumpy Old Men, but not hilarious.
Okay.
Guys, I'm at a grown-up Halloween party, all right?
You're all being unseemly.
Oh, no.
How are we unseemly?
Why is Urkel ripping the antenna off Professor Slater's car?
That's right, Professor Slim Calves.
This is what you get when you steal Jeff from a good woman.
No, Abed.
Is he meowing?
Yeah.
Enough.
I want you guys out of here.
Britta, I don't care about your high school soap opera.
Abed, you're not Batman.
Pierce, Pierce, Pierce.
Stop grinding on the Women's Studies department.
You are too old to be tripping.
I'm old?
What do you mean old?
Who's hands are these?
Stop me.
Way to go.
I know I'm not Batman.
You could try not being a jerk.
She's pretty hot.
Well, where were we, little doggie?
Unseemly.
Yeah, crap.
Shirley?
Shirley?
This is Professor Robin Hood's office.
What are you doing?
Putting this hose in her desk.
You turn the water on.
Why?
To teach that long neck, weave-having bank teller she can't steal another woman's man, that's why.
Uh I have a confession to make.
I think some of what I just said may have more to do with my situation.
Yeah, the long neck, weave-having bank teller didn't feel universal.
My ex-husband came by this morning, and he asked for his ring back.
It was his mother's, and he wants to give it to his new girlfriend.
Shirley, that sucks.
The best thing that ever happened to me was him leaving.
I just always thought he'd come crawling back, and I'd get to tell him to go to hell.
He couldn't even give me that.
You know what the crazy thing is?
Everything you've done tonight?
It's like I was too proud to admit I was hurt, so I had to pretend that you were.
I totally get that.
I feel better now.
Let's go check on Annie.
Can you believe I targeted this poor lady?
Look at all these awards, I bet she's nice.
Yeah.
Nice and pretentious.
Pierce, are you okay?
Hey, man, what's going on?
You have a full-on erection.
Just relax.
Relax, man.
Just relax.
Just relax, okay?
You are too old to be tripping.
You're going to die.
You are too old to be tripping.
Tell me about The Beatles, Pierce.
Tell me about Woodstock and sputnik, Pierce.
Do I feel a breeze here?
Because someone just struck out.
She blew you off too, Chang.
Heh, heh, heh.
Is that what you have to fall back on?
Look at me, bro.
Look at me.
I've got the body of a fifth grader, okay?
If I was working with what you've got, she'd be at the Comfort Inn right now giving me a Mexican Halloween.
It's this campus.
It feeds on my coolness.
I got no moves anymore.
Moves?
Everything's a game to guys like you.
I know one move I bet you've never tried in your life.
What is it?
Please sleep with me.
Please.
Pretty please.
I'm so lonely.
I haven't slept with anyone in a very long time, and you're so good-looking.
Please do me the favor of having sex with me.
Okay.
Stay three steps behind and promise you won't tell anybody.
I promise.
I promise.
Everybody stay out of the library.
Pierce, it's okay.
Come out of there.
No, I'm not ready to die.
You're not gonna die.
Look at me.
Just keep walking.
Don't make eye contact.
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.
Pierce is freaking out.
You're the only one that can help.
What makes you think that?
Is Jeff there?
He's the only one who can help.
He says he's gonna kill himself but he doesn't want us to call 911 because he doesn't wanna get in trouble for taking drugs.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I, uh I think I have to say good night.
Are you, like, a court appointed guardian for these people?
No.
Heh.
Um They're my classmates.
Good night, Jeff.
Loser.
What in the Pink Floyd?
I'm gonna crush myself to death with desks and tables, Jeff.
Is that a death befitting a beastmaster?
I never saw Beastmaster , I just wanted to be cool.
I'm coming in there, Pierce.
Those floating Mexican skeletons were right.
My life is over.
Well, when we go to floating skeletons with our problems, we get what we pay for, don't we?
I'm old, Jeff.
Pierce, I don't know how you spent the first 60 years, but I know in the last two months, you've probably doubled the national average for amount of life lived per lifetime.
Well, I do have a young African American friend.
Yeah, and more importantly, you're dressed like a gladiator in a desk fort that you built during a bad trip.
If life is just a series of ridiculous attempts to be alive, you're a hero to everything that's ever lived.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Batman?
Yeah.
Are you staying for the party?
If I stay there can be no party.
I must be out there in the night, staying vigilant.
Wherever a party needs to be saved, I'm there.
Wherever there are masks, wherever there's tomfoolery and joy, I'm there.
But sometimes I'm not because I'm out in the night, staying vigilant, watching.
Lurking, running, jumping, hurdling, sleeping.
No, I can't sleep.
You sleep.
I'm awake.
I don't sleep, I don't blink.
Am I a bird?
No.
I'm a bat.
I am Batman.
Or am I?
Yes, I am Batman.
Happy Halloween.
I'm Batman.
You sound like Cookie Monster.
I'm Batman.
That's Batman.
Candy corn looks like tiny traffic cones.
Yeah, it sure does.
At, like, a candy traffic school.
Like a little gingerbread man at the wheel, and he's drunk.
Look out.
We driving.
Yeah, but you keep wanting to eat yourself.
All day.
That's one of my biggest fears.
What is?
If I ever, like, woke up as a doughnut.
You would eat yourself.
I wouldn't even question it.
Mm.
That would be tasty.
It's cool to know other people think about this stuff too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
So from now on, we'll refer to each other by our Spanish nombres.
There will be What's this?
It's okay, it's okay.
Do it.
Buenos dias, Winger.
Ah.
Class dismissed.
Hey.
Shirley, look.
I'm Annie's backpack.
Mmm.
Stop it, Troy.
Annie, say there are two friends and they're in the same class, and one of them wants to ask the other one out on a date.
Like a grownup date, but within biking distance of his parents' house.
Well, they could do something on campus.
Tomorrow, there's a picnic with live music on the east lawn.
They're calling it A Night Under the Stars.
Cool.
I bet Randi would love that type of thing.
Randi?
Oh, I thought Oh.
You thought I can't believe I misled you like that.
Listen, Randi can be the name of a guy or a girl.
And in this case, it is definitely a girl.
Thanks for your help.
You're welcome.
And I hate you.
And I wanna have your children.
Damn, I picked the wrong couple to follow this morning.
Jeff and Britta are dead air.
Are you okay?
It looks like you have actual bed head this morning.
In fashion, I'm what's known as a tastemaker.
And you missed an entire side of your face shaving.
And next month, so will Gwen Stefani.
Here comes Vaughn.
Bye.
Oh, crap.
Vaughn?
Vaughn.
Oh, the guy with tiny nipples you did it with.
Oh, God.
Hi, Vaughn.
Can we talk sometime?
I'm sorry about how things ended.
Well, I'm sorry I can't accept your apology because you're toxic, Britta.
You know what?
You're like the exact opposite of an antioxidant.
Yeah.
Pssh.
I got band practice.
Lates.
Can't we still be friends?
Isn't the word "later" already short enough?
Let me talk to him for you.
It'll be better if it's man-to-man.
We won't be thinking about our chubby thighs or whether or not we can have babies.
Don't talk to Vaughn.
Your hormones are clouding your Don't talk to Vaughn.
That is girl for "talk to Vaughn".
Ooh.
Sure you don't want a piece of that?
Shirley.
What is he doing?
Oh, I know exactly what he's doing.
My ex-husband spent four weeks doing that after his innocent mistake of calling me Valerie.
That boy is living in his car.
I lived in my car for a stretch in the '70s.
Nothing like bedding a woman on the vinyl back seat of a Skylark.
Of course, we didn't have the same safety standards back then, so Heh.
No condoms.
I tell you, before AIDS, sex was like shaking hands.
Hence, AIDS.
Oh, Brittles, I forgot to tell you.
I went and talked to Vaughn.
What?
Bad news is I could not patch up things between you.
You really did a number on him.
Good news is I'm the new keyboardist in his band.
I asked you not to talk to him and you completely ignored me.
Hey, Tiny, you're missing the headline.
I'm in a rock band.
Oh, I'd like to be there when the band finds out.
Oh, hi, Jeff.
We were just talking about how in today's economy Mm-mm!
Living in your car.
Living in your car.
You are living in your car.
I'm sorry, I'm not good at being coy.
Ahem.
Guys, I'm not living in my car.
I'm just sleeping in it for a couple of days while I work out some problems with my condo.
It's a very temporary issue.
Gotta pay some meaningless fees.
They'll put my locks back on the door and that'll be that.
How are you gonna get the money?
Believe me, kitten, Winger's got moves.
Jeff, do you need a place to stay?
I'd offer, but my dad's kind of racist.
You could stay with me in the dorms.
My room has a bunk bed.
A misnomer, because it's the real deal.
The next person that offers me charity or pity will be mentioned by name in my suicide note.
Oh.
Annie, Annie, thanks for your advice about A Night Under the Stars.
Of course.
Anytime, ever.
Now I've just gotta figure out what to bring to the picnic.
This is my first college girl, so I really wanna impress her.
Would you mind helping me shop for this stuff?
I'd love to.
Really?
Sure.
No.
Thanks.
Later.
Bye.
Hey.
Hey.
Wanna see my place?
I can see it from here.
Two girls are making out on the hood.
No, my real place.
Look at that.
Condo board's trying to bluff me by listing my place as available.
But look at those faucets.
Handcrafted in Italy.
One hundred percent expensive.
Those faucets are beautiful.
You know what they would go great with?
A home.
Which you no longer have.
You need to move on with your life.
Move on with my life?
Shmove shmon shmith shmy shfime.
This condo is all that's left of me.
Every part of it is a part of who I am.
Is that a bidet?
That part's for resale value.
And Saturday afternoons.
You know, downgrading your lifestyle is your chance to grow as a person.
Maybe even become one.
You know, the less you have, the more you can be.
You know what I'm saying?
There's a silver lining here, isn't there?
You're attracted to bums.
Good night.
Come on.
Why don't you have dinner at my place?
I got a hotplate that plugs into a cigarette lighter.
Yeah, but your kitchen's being towed.
Stop!
That's my house!
Can I live with you?
Yeah, cool.
Do you want top bunk or bottom bunk?
Top.
Me too.
Race you for it.
I win.
Look, I really need to liquidate some assets.
It's an emergency situation.
What kind of offer is that?
These are mint-condition issues.
I mean, the premise alone is priceless.
The guy has the powers and strength of a spider.
Your incredulity perplexes me.
No, your incredulity perplexes me, nerd.
Did I say anything in my sleep about farm animals or Brian Williams?
I don't think so.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Lucky Charms?
How are you so satisfied all the time?
I mean, don't you ever want anything more out of life than cereal?
Sometimes I pour hot cocoa mix into cold milk and drink it like a cold hot chocolate.
I call it special drink.
Someday you will know it by its true name, diabetes.
You're Goldie Hawn, Jeff.
I'm sorry?
You're Goldie Hawn.
Is it the lips?
No.
In Overboard, she was just like you.
Wealthy, assertive, arrogant, got manicures all the time.
She fell off her boat and it was good for her.
She realized she was happier poor, raising unruly boys with Kurt Russell.
Can I not be Kurt Russell?
Do whatever you want.
You just have to know what that is.
For me, it's Lucky Charms and TV.
I could use a break.
A picnic blanket.
Genius.
I was gonna lay down newspaper.
It's the blanket my grandmother used to court my grandfather.
Yeah?
That's pretty hot.
Thanks.
Oh Tell that boy how you feel.
It's scary.
If he's not interested, I could lose the friendship too.
You could.
Love is a gamble always, but waiting won't change the dice.
You either roll them or you lose your turn.
I'm going to roll them.
I am.
I just I need a few more shakes.
Mm.
Shake them in your mind, okay?
If you'll excuse me, Pierce's band is playing.
And I wanna record the train wreck.
Kind of hoping for a Michael Richards situation.
This is for you.
Oh, they're pretty good.
This isn't weird for you?
No.
Just wanna show Vaughn some support to help smooth things over.
# Saying goodbye to Britta Was the hardest thing to do # # But when someone's a bitch And a liar # # There ain't nothing left to woo # # I'm getting rid of Britta # What am I doing?
# I'm getting rid of the B # # She's a no-good B # # I'm getting rid of Britta # # I'm getting rid of the B # # She's a GDB ## Take it, Pierce.
Same as a 45-year-old, except he doesn't get as tired.
We can pick them from the cream Great to have somebody to watch stuff with.
My dad never wanted to watch anything, so I was raised by TV.
TV's the best dad there is.
TV never came home drunk.
TV never forgot me at the zoo.
TV never abused and insulted me.
Unless you count Cop Rock.
Cop Rock.
That sounds cool.
Doesn't it?
Hey.
Wow.
You guys are really dorming it up in here, huh?
Yeah.
In the last two days, I've spent a quarter.
We're having the time of our lives.
See?
Who needs platinum faucets?
Do you guys even have faucets in here?
There's a communal bathroom down the hallway.
It actually helped me come to terms with losing my condo.
You don't sit on a toilet like that until you've left the material world behind.
Pavel!
Hey, bros.
This is Pavel.
He lives next door.
He's from Poland.
Britta?
# I'm getting rid of Britta Getting rid of the B ## Excuse me.
I have a future murder victim to visit.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Sorry?
Guys, what the hell?
"Getting Rid of Britta"?
That song was disrespectful to me and to the definition of rhyme scheme.
Wow.
If you don't like my song, you don't have to listen, all right?
I'm an artist and I write what I feel.
And I feel that you suck.
Oh, oh.
All right, hold on, Vaughn.
Can I have a word with you?
Could you come here, please, for a second?
What did you just say to her?
Listen, I know Britta's your friend, but my song is more important.
Your song?
We wrote it together.
Are you trying to Garfunkel me?
Maybe, assuming to Garfunkel someone is to put up with them even though they're a fat, lazy cat who hogs the spotlight and eats all the lasagna.
I get it.
You're jealous of me.
What?
Why?
Maybe because when I put on these skinny jeans my ass looks like a baby pumpkin.
Or maybe because I'm not a small-nippled credit-hogging jag who only knows three power chords.
My band, my song.
You want that, huh, Pierce?
How do you like that?
Aah!
You get on that horse.
Lates!
Pierce, did you just defend my honor?
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Totally.
You'll light the candles and you'll take a bite and she'll take a bite and you'll laugh.
And you'll offer her your letter jacket after you notice this funny way she shakes when she gets cold.
And she'll feel like the luckiest girl in the world.
Right.
I couldn't have done this without your help.
You're really nice.
We should've hung out more in high school.
Remember when you pretended to be my backpack?
Oh.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm funny.
All right.
Ah.
I gotta go get ready.
Troy, wait.
I have to tell you.
My appendix is bursting.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah.
My appendix is bursting.
Oh.
Oh, no.
Okay, two young students.
I think I've been to this dance before.
You guys are sexual partners, right?
Us?
No.
No, he's my very good friend, and I have appendicitis.
Oh.
Thanks for bringing me here.
Guess I ruined your date, huh?
Okay.
Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with you.
Cool.
I'll see you.
God.
Where does it hurt?
Everywhere.
We have to quarantine you.
We gotta get you to a safe distance.
My date's on the east lawn.
East lawn, perfect.
Great.
Wait, wait.
This is a date?
Yeah, you need these.
Nice.
I'll be thinking of you.
Okay, I need to go.
No, we We have to observe you overnight.
It's policy.
We don't want another Vanessa Parsons on our hands.
She was the Typhoid Mary of herpes.
I'm kind of the Hawkeye around here, so it's kind of a Are you seeing anybody?
You guys weren't in Spanish class.
Knight Rider marathon.
The shadowy flight into the world of a man who does not exist.
Britta, may I have a word?
Has this always been here?
You need to take Jeff back.
Mmm.
Never had him, don't want him, especially now.
He's got a real Phil Spector vibe going.
He's like E.T.
He crashed in my place and we're friends now, which is great for me, but bad for him.
He needs to get back.
What am I supposed to do?
Use your lady parts.
Abed.
Don't be naive.
The charge between you two is keeping him going.
Tell him you'll make love to him if he takes a shower and finds a nice place to live.
I'm heading back.
Pavel's making bobka.
Do it, Britta.
Seduce him.
Draw the tapeworm of Jeff's old self out with the milk that is your sexuality.
No.
Then say goodbye to E.T. Abed, it's open.
And your wife is married to an idiot.
What's wrong now, woman?
You.
You can't see further than them What are you doing?
That was The Jeffersons, honky.
I was wrong, okay?
Material possessions are important.
How much happier were the Jeffersons than that family on Good Times?
Yeah, but they had good times.
Do good times really matter?
What about good cars, good lobster?
What about that sport where the British people ride the horses with the really long hammers?
Jeez, you are way out of your element here.
Yes, and I do not believe a single word I am saying for me.
But for you?
Maybe you're one of those rare people with nothing underneath the surface.
Maybe if you put stain remover on a turd, you don't get a diamond.
You just get a turd with less direction in life.
Thanks, coach.
Can you turn the TV back on?
Faucets.
Italian faucets.
Handcrafted.
These look like Wait.
I made this notch to indicate optimal cleansing temperature for combination skin.
These were mine?
For a fancy condo, you've got awful security.
Install those in a new apartment so that every day, when you spend too much time on your hair, you can look down and think: "I was a huge phony before.
I can do it again".
Yeah.
You're into me.
I beg your unbelievable pardon?
Look at all this work you're doing just to have me around again.
You were more attracted to me than you were willing to admit.
I was doing this all for Abed.
You are the worst.
Yeah, clearly.
Sorry.
Greendale, thank you for I want you to know I haven't changed my mind about the band.
I'm out.
We wanna recognize a couple of sponsors.
First off is Anderson Septic.
Also, do me a favor, will you?
Lay off Britta.
I mean, she may walk like she just got off a horse, but underneath all that clown makeup, she's a good kid.
Mm-hm.
No worries, man.
I've moved on.
Lates.
Lates, okay.
Snakes.
What?
Greendale!
# Pierce, I don't need you In my band # # I don't need your heart Or your hand # # I am my own person # # And, Pierce, you're a B # Yeah, you heard me say it.
# Pierce, you're a B # No!
Before you two proceed, I have one thing to say.
Did you say it already?
I want my nana's blanket back.
Do you guys mind?
Could you scoot over?
It's an heirloom.
I want it.
Thank you.
Have a nice date.
I don't care what you think.
For me, that was huge.
I know, sweetie.
Let's go find you some pants.
Okay?
Yeah, cool, thanks.
# This a song for Pierce Him so old # # His body made Of wrinkles and folds # # Stupid and ugly He smells like a fart # # Poo-poo in his pants And poo-poo in my heart ## Hey, look what the cat dragged out and licked clean.
I saw how much you missed me, and smelled what happens to Pavel on cabbage night, and realized the world was better off with me in it.
Thanks.
For caring.
Hey.
You looked like you moved out.
I checked into a motel and I'm looking for apartments.
You would've been fine with me staying forever?
Yup.
You're pretty cool, Abed.
You're a huge nerd.
Thanks.
# Pierce, Pierce, Pierce Pierce, you're a B # I'm Pierce.

# Pierce, Pierce, Pierce # # Pierce, you're a B ## Ow!
We are Some Worries!
Good night, Greendale!
# East side, west side North side, south # # Vaughn's breath is so bad His butt's mad at his mouth # # This rap is by Pierce Vaughn is dumb # # He wears diapers to bed And sucks his mother's thumb # # And when he wakes up stupid Wishing he was me # # He has a big poop breakfast With a glass of pee # # Then he goes to school Where he's stupid again # # And everybody hates him Even all his friends # # When you come after Pierce Then the battle is on # # So this rap goes out To stupid Vaughn ## Uh-huh.
Well played, Pierce.
This isn't over.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
So then the guy says to the housekeeper: "Make sure she's dead".
Stop me if you've heard this before.
Would've been nice The housekeeper says to the guy, "We don't have a pool".
And the guy says Good morning, Greendale.
Just a reminder, our debate team will bring home the championship tomorrow versus City College.
Go, Human Beings.
Great, now I gotta start the whole joke over again.
Okay, so this No!
I've got one for you.
A doddering old fool walks into a bar, tells a stupid joke, and I crush his windpipe with my three-ringed binder.
I don't get it.
Britta's trying to give up cigarettes.
Don't tell them my business.
I'll slap that look off your pointy face.
Britta, I'm saying this because I care about you and you're my friend.
You need to start smoking again.
I really think you should.
You lose weight and your skin looks great when you smoke.
Guys, I appreciate your support, but I've got to quit.
Have you thought about hypnotherapy?
I know a hypnotherapist.
Ten-to-one says it's him.
His name is Pierce Hawthorne.
And I'm very effective.
Can you help me block out people's voices I find extremely annoying?
Jeff, she's right there.
Pierce, I would be grateful for your help.
You would?
Super.
I'll set it up.
What?
I feel bad for him.
Plus, I just yelled at him.
You yelled at me too.
Oh.
Did I hurt your feelings, pointy face?
Wow.
Wow.
Have you seen the film department's website?
What do you think?
All of Abed's films are about us.
What?
Check it out.
What else is new?
Jeff.
Hola.
Jeff, stop being so relaxed.
We need to talk to you about You're living out of your car.
Why on earth are you living out of your car?
Those people look just like us.
That's eerie.
Fine, it's true.
I'm living out of my car.
And I don't want anyone's help.
We had almost that exact conversation last week.
Yeah, but Abed posted this video two weeks ago.
That boy is a soothsayer.
This is wrinkling my brain.
This is wrinkling my brain.
That's wrinkling my brain.
Get a load of these wrinkles.
Heh, heh.
Who's that old guy?
Hi.
I'm Pierce Hawthorne.
Oh, come on.
There he is.
Oh.
Mr. Winger.
Hold on.
Did you to hear my announcement?
I hang on every word.
I assume that's sarcasm.
Correct.
You didn't hear?
I'm barely listening now.
Oh, okay.
My debate partner dropped out.
We need you for the championship.
Jeffrey, as debate coach, I'm offering you an opportunity to spend a night drinking from the cup of life rather than romancing your nether regions in front of the E!
Channel.
Come on, Jeff, who better than a former lawyer to really stick it to those City College snobs and their star debater, Simmons?
Mmm.
Pass.
Okay, no, no, no.
Wait.
Okay, no, no, no.
Look.
Listen, jerk wad.
I'm sorry, that got heated.
Greendale needs a win.
The best compliment our sports program gets is that our basketball team is really gay.
So, what's it gonna take?
A plum parking space?
Free meals?
A night of companionship, if you know what I mean?
I'll do it for the parking space.
And if you promise not to tell me what you mean.
All right.
Yeah.
Pierce, thank you.
I really appreciate you helping me out.
And I appreciate the opportunity.
You know, sometimes I think people don't take me seriously.
What are you gonna do?
Wave a pocket watch in front of my face and tell me I'm getting very sleepy.
Just checking the time.
Now close your eyes and keep them closed at all times.
And listen to the soothing sound of my voice.
The only word that will bring you out is "gorilla".
Okay, now, focus on the rhythm of your own breathing.
And when you feel the desire to light up a cigarette you will associate these urges with things in your life that disgust you.
Bad tasting food, sex with men, wearing attractive clothing.
Oh, God, I think I really hurt myself.
Somebody help me.
Oh!
Britta, wake up.
Why did I put you under so well?
Damn my talents.
Aah!
The topic for the debate is, "Are people inherently good or evil"?
When do you want to get together to strategize?
Annie, I was a lawyer.
I was a debater for money.
I think I can handle this.
So how was hypnotherapy?
He fell down while I laid there to make him feel like a good hypnotherapist.
You realize this will never end.
It's already done.
He just wants one more session.
# Wah-waah!
# Where's Abed?
I need to talk to him about his films.
That boy is flat-out prescient.
He can read our minds.
I know.
You watched my movies.
He's a witch.
Get him.
I'm not a witch.
I'm a student of human character.
I know you guys all so well I can predict your behavior.
Like, Shirley, I know you're a sweet, Christian, generous person.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, that's nice.
I know you have rage issues.
Careful, boy.
Oh!
Careful, boy.
Here, check this out.
May I?
Okay.
Yeah.
Jeff acts like nothing affects him, but things bother him more than he lets on.
Hey, I'm top of the class.
He's also very vain.
Pfft!
Ridiculous.
Ohh.
Why am I crying?
Will I listen to "Come Sail Away" by Styx again?
Don't worry, Troy, it's just a movie.
I can't predict the future.
I hurt my leg.
Ah!
What up, happy people?
You tell me my future right now, evil wizard.
By the way, I think your shirt's trying to get out of your pants.
As Golding's Lord of the Flies demonstrates, man, when left to his own devices, will descend into chaos and evil.
And now, from City College, Jeremy Simmons.
Jeremy.
Jeremy.
Jeremy.
Jeremy.
There were 23,000 kidney donations in America last year.
Man is good.
The average life expectancy for a man in a community is 23 years longer than a man alone.
Man is good.
And just 10 minutes ago, a bald, bespectacled man held the door for a man in a wheelchair.
Man is good.
Oh.
Heh, heh.
I hate this guy.
By the end of this debate I will prove with facts and data that man is inherently good.
Little trick for achieving the proper competitive mind set.
I always envision my opponent having aggressive sex with my mother.
This feels so formal.
Let's just talk.
People are evil.
They can't help it.
I didn't catch your name.
It's Jean.
Take Jean here.
She spent a lot of time this morning making herself look so lovely.
Tell me, how many people bothered to tell you how great you look today?
None.
Man is evil.
But you just said how great I looked.
For my own selfish purposes.
The fact is, as hot as you look and it is quite hot, I wouldn't have said anything.
When I talk about people being evil, I could cite quotes, or dig up statistics, but those are just words and numbers.
I think we could have a little more fun if I express myself in song.
# Evil woman # # Evil woman ## That's my time, everybody.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
At the end of round one.
City College, 50.
Greendale, eight.
I got eight?
I only got eight?
She got eight.
You got zero.
It's debate, not American Idol.
Nice work, L.A. Law.
All sizzle, no steak.
I don't care, dude.
I'm doing this for a parking space.
Let's go, boys.
Come on, let's go.
I wanna see some hustlers out there.
Let's go.
By Zeus.
What sort of jackassery is this?
We're in the middle of a debate.
We reserved the gym for practice so Yup, they reserved it.
Okay, they got us by the short ones.
The debate is suspended until tomorrow.
Hopefully, by then we can get our act together.
Oh, great try, Bruce.
Great try.
When are we getting together to prepare for tomorrow?
Never.
Because it's stupid and I don't care.
Bite me.
Maybe Simmons is right.
You really are all sizzle and no steak.
You probably couldn't beat him.
What do you mean, I can't beat him?
You and I are going to study harder and beat City College tomorrow.
Really?
No.
Who am I, iCarly?
Abed is right, you act like things don't bother you, but they do.
Look, six months ago I was a lawyer.
I wore suits.
I used to say stuff like "objection" and "sidebar".
Now I'm losing a community college debate to Jeremy "Soul Patch" Simmons.
Hey, Winger.
You like to sing?
I like to sing too.
# Zero for Winger # Kick that.
# Was a big shot lawyer # # Now he's a loser ## Lay off, Simmons.
Jeff didn't understand the rules.
Yeah?
What's your excuse, eight points?
Dude, leave her out of this.
# Little Annie Adderall Was an outcast in high school ## That's it.
Dude, we are gonna debate the living crap out of you.
We've got some preparing to do.
I liked you better smoking.
I'm so sorry.
No.
You're right, my feet are long and stupid.
You can't unring that bell.
Oh, no.
That's my newspaper.
What do you need a paper for?
You knew what was gonna happen, you Magic Eight Ball.
Pierce hurt his leg.
Britta made Troy cry.
What's my destiny?
Am I gonna die in a car?
Is it going to happen soon?
Shirley, I'm just an entertainer.
But if it will make you feel better, here, let me show you what I'm working on.
Were No.
Were Is that me being chased down by a werewolf?
Yeah, that's how you'd behave in that situation.
No?
The situation being me being chased down by a werewolf.
Mm-hm.
And that's Jeff locking lips with Annie?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
You're a fool.
Stanford students were divided into prisoners and guards.
The guards immediately started to abuse Ugh!
What's wrong?
I have this pain above my eyebrow.
It's a stress headache.
I got my first one when I was 4.
I hate it.
Well, get to used to it.
You're knee-deep in it, brother.
This is debate.
If you want to win, you need to prepare.
Well, agreed.
But if you want to win, you need to loosen up.
Go off-book, robot debater.
Oh, my gosh.
You're right.
Simmons is so good at using his inherent magnetism to sell his points and here I am, like a spinster librarian with my hair pulled back.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Be careful.
Abed thinks you two are going to kiss.
Ha-ha-ha!
Ridiculous.
Us kissing.
That is ridiculous.
Totally.
We should get back to work.
Yes.
Okay.
The People are inherently evil.
Oh, we can use this Hobbes quote.
"Man is a collection of base, animal urges".
To act on them and experience sinful pleasure "would be morally no different than taking a breath".
That's poignant, right?
Yeah.
You know, maybe we should study alone.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Separately.
That way we can be more reproductive Productive.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, you forgot your phone.
Oh, I can get another one.
The next time you even see a cigarette, you will think of things that disgust you.
And while you're under so deep, you'll find yourself attracted to slightly older men.
Perhaps some barrel-chested stud with just enough, heh, tummy to love.
You'll want to buy him dinner.
Then go back to his hot tub.
You'll invite one of your friends to join us for a three-way.
Maybe someone with low self-esteem and slightly larger breasts.
Go to hell, you disgusting pig.
A-ha!
Pierce, I was awake the whole time.
I was faking it.
I know.
I saw you.
What do you think I am?
Some joke?
No.
No, I was trying to make you feel better about yourself.
How dare you pity me.
I may be a little older, my ideas may seem weird, my fashion sense may cause envy, but I have a lot to offer and I will not to be pitied.
Do not help me up.
And as German poet Franz Wickmeyer once wrote: "Snow falls from the heavens pure.
We cannot blame the snow for being soiled by the Earth".
Man is good.
What?
That dude gets it.
Jeff Winger will now offer a two-minute rebuttal.
Hey, sizzle.
What are you going to sing tonight?
I'm in the mood for Sade.
In the Stanford Prison Experiment, when given absolute power, abused and tortured their fellow students.
My competitor likened people to pure, falling snow.
I would respond, "There is none righteous, no, not one".
Now, I realize Mr. Simmons' quote was from the great Franz Wickmeyer.
Mine was just from a simple desert handyman named Jesus.
Oh, that's nice.
Survival of the fittest wires an impulse to eliminate people into our hearts.
Counter point.
Mother Teresa, Joan of Arc.
Rebuttal.
Nuclear bombs.
Nuclear families.
Abu Ghraib.
Apu from The Simpsons.
Double rejoinder.
Telemarketers.
Organ donors.
Hate crimes.
Executions.
Ketchup is a vegetable.
Wow.
This is a real barn-burner.
Oh, God, did I just say cross-burner?
No, you did not.
Oh, good.
We make an amazing team.
I know, we're so in sync, we're like a perfect duet or great se Hey, Professor Whitman.
Your preparation was impeccable.
You remind me of a young me with slightly worse hair.
I just checked with the judges.
They'll need a miracle to win in rebuttal.
Simmons is finished.
This is too much for me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's going off-book.
Why is he ripping the cards, doesn't he need the cards?
It's a gambit.
He hates me, yet he caught me.
Man is good.
Abed.
Abed.
He was horny, so he dropped him.
Man is evil.
Greendale wins.
Huzzah!
Eat that, Simmons.
God.
That off-book enough for you?
Simmons got robbed.
They kissed.
You do have powers.
I'm going to die by werewolf.
Shirley, I don't have powers.
Trust me.
In my next film, we discover Pierce is an actual genius.
That's not gonna happen.
No, it's not.
Pierce, I can't smoke a cigarette without thinking of a three-way in your hot tub.
You did it.
Yes.
I did?
You're a genius.
Who's the third?
You did great in there.
Let's take this bacchanalia outside.
Full moon tonight.
Shirley.
Shirley.
Well, I'm going this way, so Well, congratulations, buddy.
Thanks, pal.
Just pat me.
Cut.
Cut, let me ask you a question.
Do you hate this?
Do you hate doing this?
Do you?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Just hold on.
Just have fun with it.
Take 36.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Okay, you can hear me?
Okay.
Good morning.
I'm here to kick off the first day of a new tradition at our school called Green Week.
What?
First, we give a month to black history, now seven days on the Irish.
All this week, Greendale College is becoming so Earth-smart that we're changing our name to Envirodale.
But we were already called Greendale.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, there's also going to be a free rock 'n' roll concert by a certain band called Green Day.
That make you happy?
No, not really.
We need to re-do these.
We printed 5000.
Well, print 5000 more.
I'm trying to save a planet here.
Pencils down.
Annie.
I wasn't I want you all to write a one-page essay, in español entitled, "Annie's Mistake".
Why doesn't Annie have to write it?
Okay, two pages, entitled: "The Consequences of Questioning Authority".
This is Spanish.
I know how to say "hello," "tomorrow" and tables are female.
That's the only Spanish you taught us.
Oh!
Six pages on ignorance.
Guys, put your hands down.
Señor Chang, please continue.
We respect your authority.
Thank you, Britta.
Twenty pages on ass kissing.
Due on Monday.
This Monday?
If Señor Chang gets any crazier, he's gonna win the Grammy award.
I've already reported him to the dean.
He said they've been trying to fire him for years but nobody wants his job.
I can't write a 20-page paper.
I got a presentation in Marketing.
And public speaking gives me the nervous sweats.
I can help you with that.
I accept.
That's how messed up things are.
Well, we're screwed too.
We're three days behind on a Biology lab.
Troy's afraid of I'm not afraid, Abed.
I choose not to be around rats because they are unpopular.
Same goes for centipedes and lakes.
There's only one solution.
Someone has to go to Chang and talk to him.
I vote we all look at Jeff at the same time.
In a way, all of you are right.
What was I tuning out?
You have to get Chang to call off this homework.
You're the one with the silver tongue.
Yeah, go tongue Chang.
What makes you think I could convince Chang if I can't even convince you not to make me do it?
Jeff does raise a good point.
Wait.
You are convincing.
You could do it.
Yeah.
You want me to risk the C that I'm pulling in that psycho's class by putting myself on his radar?
I mean, that guy goes any more nuts, he's gonna win a Grammy.
You are hilarious.
That's very funny.
What is it, the chair?
How do you gonna keep pulling a C in that psycho's class if he keeps assigning this much work?
Because I have you guys.
Well, guess what, handsome hobo?
Your gravy train's leaving the station.
Ignore what she's doing.
We are serious.
Fine, I'll do it.
But when you find my body, don't believe the suicide note.
This better not awaken anything in me.
Green Day is here.
Wow.
Okay, what's this about now?
We're Greene Daeye.
Thank you.
Oh.
What do you want, Winger?
You complaining about the homework on behalf of the class?
Can I ask you a personal question, Señor Chang?
Okay, Freud.
Sure, you try to penetrate my psychological armor and you Did your wife leave you?
Holy How'd you know?
Well, when you pick juries, you learn to read the little stuff.
Same shirt twice in one week.
Teaching us the word esposa means "liar".
A picture of you with a woman with a Post-it note dialogue balloon above her head that says, "Enjoy it while it lasts".
We met at a salsa club.
And, um, she loved the way I danced.
But, I mean, you know how it goes.
You get a job You stop salsa dancing.
Of course I know.
You make no mistake about this, Winger.
I pleasured that woman greatly.
Yeah.
You look like you would have to.
I'm not surprised you said that.
I like you, Winger.
Pickled bull testicle?
Are you offering or collecting?
Troy, sing.
The assignment is to train a rat to a song.
Yeah.
Did you have to pick a duet?
Hm?
He did it.
Good boy, Fievel.
Commencing reward.
I have to open the cage.
Yeah, you don't have to warn me, I'm not afraid.
Fievel.
Everybody shut up.
I'll kick all your asses, but you all have to come up here.
Dude, you are gonna be fine.
You just have to move on.
And if you hang out with me sometime, you will see how great single life can be.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What about tonight?
Absolutely.
Oh, shoot.
My Spanish study group has to get together every night now.
You have been really letting us have it with this homework.
I really have, haven't I?
Yeah.
Tell you what.
For my new buddy, Jeff, essay cancelled.
Shh-clacky.
Fantastic.
That is fantastic.
Everybody will be so happy.
Oh-oh-oh.
I didn't say everybody.
It's for my new friend Jeff.
I mean, you're the one coming out with me, right?
Right.
Yeah.
I suppose that will put you in an unenviable, uncomfortable position.
Here's your jacket.
Let's do this.
Awesome, great.
Is there a rat in here?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Abed.
El Tigre.
Well, did you talk to Chang?
Yeah, but it didn't do any good.
My still head hurts from the yelling.
My pupils are more sensitive to light because he yelled at me so much.
Oh, well, now I feel bad that we made you do that.
Maybe we can help with your essay.
Oh, that's okay.
I'm working on mine by myself.
You could do my homework next time.
See you in class.
He's hiding something.
Britta, Jeff suffered for us.
Give him a little credit.
Yeah.
You can be pretty cold.
Troy?
Damn.
Here comes Abed.
He needs my help.
I gotta get out of here.
Troy?
You guys seen a rat?
Troy knocked over Fievel's cage and he escaped.
Oh, Abed, I'm sorry.
He probably found more rats and is very happy living with them.
Try to join the rest of us in reality, Britta.
I believe that, uh, fusing brownies with the, uh, Internet is going to create the next Napster for brownies.
Yawn!
Can't I just write it on cards?
No.
Do you know anybody who reads from cards?
No.
No, you don't, and that's why.
Also, you might consider a darker top.
Note taken.
Oh, and don't lock your knees.
Never lock your knees.
You know what happens when you lock your knees?
You die.
Second, when you wanna drive home a point, hand them a sandwich.
Try it.
Hand them a sandwich.
See?
Hand them a sandwich.
Yeah.
Except that you're You just dropped the sandwich as opposed to handing it to them.
Handing the palm.
Yeah.
Try attention-grabbing words to wake up the audience, such as: Multiple orgasm.
Oh, no, no.
I don't think that would fit into my message.
Maybe we should focus more on Whatever.
Yeah, and about these filler words of yours.
I mean, nobody wants to buy brownies from somebody that says "um" and "like".
I have a method for fixing that.
From the top.
Okay.
These brownies are, uh Uh!
They, um Um!
These brownies are delicious.
They taste like Like.
That's not a filler word.
Whatever, valley girl.
The difference between usted and tu is a matter of formality.
You are old.
You are ugly.
No, you're not.
Thanks, sir.
Shakira.
Shakira.
What's up?
You are dirty.
Dude.
Still formal but plural because while both are dirty, neither are my friends.
Okay?
And on another subject, hope you guys are working hard on your essays.
That's gonna be 30 percent of your grade.
Oh, no.
Jeff already turned in his essay.
Great job.
Thanks.
As soon as you turn in your essays on Monday, there's gonna be a big-ass quiz, so study hard.
Class dismissed.
Dude.
Dude.
Crazy night last night, man.
That was crazy.
When you go out with me, it gets crazy.
That's the Winger guarantee.
Dude, let's do it again.
Yeah, I want to, it's just the quiz, you know?
Study, study.
Well, how about this: Bling.
A-plus.
Nice work, Winger.
I knew I could do it if I applied myself.
Cherry daiquiri.
Cherry daiquiri.
Later.
You devious clump of overpriced fabric and hair product.
Speaking as one of the meek, soon as I inherit the Earth, you dead.
You got a weird forehead.
We're all very disappointed.
All right, dial it back a little, Britta.
If anyone should be disappointed, it's me.
What kind of a group threatens to kick someone out unless he helps them?
What kind of a person is asked to help other people and then helps himself?
Helps himself?
I don't like being talked to that way.
He's using fake outrage to justify leaving.
Fake outrage?
Justify my?
Yeah, that's it, I'm out of here.
Are you breaking up with the group?
That's what you guys want.
I've been divorced seven times.
Don't answer your phones and bury all your money in the backyard.
Here you go.
Look at Pierce's paragraph from unit two.
Let's see, "I took a computer class at tienda de manzana," the Apple Store.
Adorable.
Keep going.
"And the saleswoman had manzanas gigantes.
" Ruined it.
Imagine being married to him?
Seven times.
Seven different women agreed to marry that guy.
It's crazy.
I'm so alone.
I'm so lonely I wanna die.
Come on, man.
It Come on.
Don't do that.
I just miss her so much.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
This is so stupid.
No, no, no, it's fine, it's just Buddy, you know I'm dumb.
I can see that you're hurting but I have to get to Accounting.
It's not like I'm hitting strip clubs with Professor Whitman.
You better not be.
What?
All I ask is for you to keep filling the void in my soul.
I'll have to think of something.
Let me rest gently on your pecs.
Best closer to a presentation, a Nicholson quote.
You take a phrase from one of his films and you tailor it to your product.
You can't handle a moist towelette.
Something like that, you know.
But you can't use that one.
That's mine.
Thanks, Pierce.
I'm gonna write it on some cards.
Okay.
Just don't let anybody know I was involved.
Why do you care so much?
I don't.
Because Fievel's going to die.
I'd rather die than listen.
Who's going to die?
Yeah.
The exterminator is coming because of our rat.
I'd like to exterminate this conversation.
What are you doing?
He's sitting in Jeff's chair so he's trying to act like Jeff.
Oh!
Oh.
E-mail.
I thought you might wanna help me.
We are friends.
Abed, take it from a former prom king.
Real friends help me with things, not vice versa.
I would face my fears to help you.
Exactly.
Because you're my friend.
Am I?
Abed.
If he gets any nuttier, they're gonna put him on The View.
That works.
Yeah.
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna study.
Ah!
Fievel?
Fievel.
Fievel?
Fievel.
Fievel.
Okay, thank you.
Green Week was a rousing success here at Greendale.
And now for our band, Greene Daeye.
They're not the real Green Day.
Thought we should just rip that Band-Aid off quickly.
Okay.
Hey.
What's up?
Just got your text, man.
Wanna hang out?
Because if you don't, I will fail you.
Actually, I had an idea for an extra-credit project.
We've been asked to dedicate our first song to "Señor and Señora Chang".
She said she didn't wanna talk to me.
I didn't tell her you wanted to talk.
"The estimation of market value of brownies has" "I, uh Target group" Ms. Bennett, I'm afraid I have to ask you to put down the cards.
Uh l Uh They are wonderful.
We all love brownies.
They're delicious.
If you love brownies, you love life.
Orgasmically delicious.
Here's Brownie.
God, he's on my leg!
He's on my leg!
Disgusting.
Thank you.
What's Chang doing?
He's getting a refill on his void.
I got an A on my presentation and a lot of the credit goes to Pierce.
And I had a great sandwich.
We found the stupid rat and Abed's gonna shut up about it.
It's true.
I have something to say.
I've been a horrible husband and I've been a horrible teacher.
And I'd like to thank my student, Jeff Winger, for showing me that and helping me fix my marriage.
No more 20-page essays due on Monday.
Oh, that's nice.
Thank you.
Although, Winger, you should write a one-page essay called: "Taking Advantage of the Emotionally Vulnerable".
Boo-yah.
You did that for us?
Mm.
Kind of.
I thought hanging out with you guys was the worst way to pass Spanish.
I was wrong.
Well, we're the best.
Jeff, I'm sorry I called you a handsome hobo.
If you need help with that essay, you can rejoin the group.
Thanks.
What are you guys talking to me for?
You go dance.
I know your secret.
I know about the chair.
Whoa.
What model did you get?
It's the Tsunami 3000 Anniversary Edition.
You?
The Devil's Drench XJ11.
This is gonna be awesome.
Establish base camps.
What part of the library do you want?
North east is closest to the drinking fountain, which is the All right, guys, are we gonna do this thing?
Pierce, I hope that's the tiny gun that you throw at us to confuse us while you grab the giant gun taped to your back.
Seriously, this hardly seems like a fair fight.
Ah!
Oh, it's pepper water.
Oh, it's pep Who puts pepper in water?
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
I booked a sketch artist, an improv troupe, and a laser projecting a burning pelvis onto the ceiling.
A laser?
Well, this isn't gonna be your mother's sexually transmitted disease awareness fair.
You've been quite the little helper, Annie.
STD fair, guys.
Catch knowledge.
You think you're better than me?
No.
You stick to quoting movie lines, I'll stick to sports.
Trying to reduce my referencing.
Well, you're not moving into sports.
You and I are playing real basketball, right now.
Sounds fun.
No, it doesn't.
And it won't be.
Catch knowledge.
Sorry, not interested in ignoring your very important cause.
Hi, I'm Jeff Winger.
Oh, Sabrina is my new secretary.
Secretary is a little degrading to women.
I help the dean do office-y things.
Oh, gender saved.
My casual friend and I are gonna have a non-romantic breakfast if you'd like to join us.
Cafeteria's closed.
Fortune cookie?
Isn't it great?
Greendale is the latest campus to catch a case of public-health fever.
You know the toilets in the women's bathrooms don't have seats, right?
Because they keep getting stolen.
Sabrina, take a note.
I want hidden cameras in every stall.
Problem solved.
"You will get AIDS".
Flip it over.
"Unless you go to the STD fair".
I wrote that.
Congratu Horrible.
See you later.
Catch knowledge.
Jeff, you and I are friends, right?
Okay.
You may have noticed a recent change in my demeanor.
I haven't.
Well, I have a new girlfriend.
She is super-smart, if you know what I mean.
I always know what you mean.
Can't wait for you to meet her.
You know, when you catch a big fish, you wanna stuff her and put her on the mantle.
How about tonight?
I doubt it.
Troy and I played basketball.
It's fun.
Don't gloat.
It's impossible to guard you.
Your eyes are too gentle and mysterious.
Hey, guys, Jeff and I are double-dating tonight with my new girlfriend.
Ooh!
You got that from "I doubt it"?
Pierce has got a girlfriend.
That's great.
What does she do?
She's an escort.
Oh.
Some mysteries solve themselves.
No, no, no, that's just her profession.
She doesn't escort me.
No, no.
I met her in my Marketing class.
And I'm taking Doreen to Annie's mixer tonight.
You mean the STD fair.
Catch knowledge.
Taking a call girl to an STD fair?
There's a joke here.
So, Jeff, dust off that black book and rustle up a honey, huh?
Is there a pill that makes the word "no" clearer?
Well, it is pretty short notice.
Probably couldn't get a date anyway.
Ooh.
I'm sure you're right.
Ooh.
Maybe it has something to do with crabs.
They're like a food but also a disease?
I wonder, Jeff, for all your feather flashing, when was the last time you actually scored?
I don't know the precise date, Pierce, because I'm not you.
So there's no receipt.
Ooh.
Ehh.
Oh, come on.
Shouldn't take pot shots at some woman because you can't get a date.
I can get dates any time I want.
What is this, some kind of joke?
No, this is.
"Don't eat the crab dip".
Yeah.
Ahh!
You hear that, Annie?
That's the sound of STDs screaming, "No, stop being so aware of us".
And it's all thanks to you.
I was voted "most likely to succeed" at my rehab clinic.
Well, in recognition of all your hard work, I have decided that you should conduct the condom demonstration.
You're gonna be center stage showing everyone how to put a condom on a, uh Well, what my dad called a Jimmy Carter.
Um, I don't know if I'm the right person.
Don't worry.
Not a real one.
No, it's an anatomically correct model, you know.
But trust me, eyes closed, you can't tell the difference.
Mmm.
Okay.
Hey, it's Jeff Winger.
Well, I wanted to see what you were doing tonight.
Do I know your name?
What kind of question is that?
Of course I know.
Well, if I answer now, you'll never learn a valuable lesson about trust, Jennifer.
Crap.
Ugh.
Pierce really got to you, huh?
It has been a dry spell.
But it's been a while since I've tried.
So I'm trying.
Yeah, I can see that.
This is a lot of outgoing calls.
"Car Wash Redhead".
"Tube Top R.E.M. Concert".
"Juror Number 6".
That sounds above board.
At least you have "Mommy" in here.
That's not my mom.
Dude, not cool.
You saying "dude" is not cool.
What are you doing?
"Hot Blonde Spanish Class"?
You're welcome.
This is the phone book of a man in his 20s.
The women literally have no identities.
It's pretty shallow.
You're right.
I can't believe I haven't seen it before now.
Whatever.
I'm gonna go study with Shirley.
Well, I'll be here, rethinking my way of life.
Mm.
Call "Mommy".
Guys, I have a problem.
The dean wants me to demonstrate proper use of a condom at the stupid fair, by putting one on a mannequin's stupid thingamabob.
It's a big honor but I'm gonna screw it up.
Well, it's easy enough to practice.
Britta, do you have a banana?
This is an anatomically correct model I'll be handling.
Real whatchamacallits are nothing like bananas.
Are they?
Have you never seen one?
Shh!
Annie, being a virgin in this day and age is something to be proud of.
You're like a unicorn.
I'm not a unicorn.
I had relations with my high school boyfriend.
We did it to Madonna's Erotica on the floor of his walk-in closet.
But he wouldn't let me look at it.
He cried after and during.
He's gay now.
I think he was gay then.
So you never seen one when you were growing up?
Like, you know, on the Internet, in a picture, or Harvey Keitel's?
I've caught glimpses but I've never got a real good look at one.
What I need to do is practice on the actual model.
But the dean has it locked in his office.
Okay, that's easy.
We'll go to him, ask him if we No.
This is really embarrassing.
I don't want anyone to know.
I just wanna figure out how to do it and get it over with.
The dean is counting on me, and I want him to know that I'm someone he can trust.
We have to break into his office.
I actually have no problem with that.
I think I could do that.
Oh, hello, Jeffrey.
Hi, Pierce.
I was just going into the fair to wait for my smoking-hot date.
That's nice.
How about you?
Were you ever able to, you know, come up with a date?
No, no, because I didn't try, because taking a date to an STD fair would be lame.
Don't worry about it, kid.
You're going through a dry spell.
From my experience, they don't last any more than 12, 13 years.
Excuse me.
No gonorrhea, please, please, please.
No gonorrhea.
Ow!
It burns.
Oh!
That's gonna hurt.
Gross.
Dean, your assistant, is she single?
What are her likes and dislikes?
Yes, on single.
She likes hip-hop and horses.
Dislikes beards and Yeah, I was done talking.
Is it me or are horses the most beautiful creatures?
They're so majestic.
Totally.
Just this morning, when I was shaving and listening to the new Jay-Z, I was thinking how I wanna squeeze in a gallop this weekend.
Do you own a horse?
Can you ever really own a horse?
Pierce.
Yeah?
This is Sabrina.
Thirty seconds after you walked away, I asked her to be my date and she said yes.
You must have a great personality.
Thank you.
Congratulations, Jeff, you proved me wrong.
You got a girl.
Yeah, I did.
Oh.
This is Doreen.
Ready for our double-date?
Yes, I am.
Wait, how'd you do that?
Is this the best safe-sex fair or what?
Ha-ha-ha!
Check out these condoms.
All along the side it says, "Greendale".
Exclamation point, my idea.
Wow.
Me, in a dune buggy, with syphilis.
This is going on the fridge.
Heh, heh.
Look how gorgeous Doreen is tonight.
Hey, can we?
Let's lay out our plans for the evening.
You wingman me, I wingman you.
Maybe we split up for a little hoo-ha and then meet in the morning for eggs and details.
That sounds like the worst combination plate ever.
Thanks.
Argh!
I can't believe you beat me again.
Do you want my stuffed animal?
Gah!
We're arm wrestling.
Like Stallone in Over the Top.
I don't know the rules.
Don't I need a semi-truck and a son?
The rules are, "You suck".
Let's go.
Uh, I wanna wait for a more inspiring song.
This score isn't right.
There we go.
Oh, my God.
You broke my hand, you bastard.
I can't do anything with this.
No, let me see that.
Oh, I can see through the door.
Oh, yeah, there she blows.
I wanna see, I wanna see.
Shh!
Okay, go, go, go.
Go ahead.
I'm the one that needs to see.
Okay, okay, okay.
It's okay.
Oh, boy.
Oh, I had it wrong.
Is that considered large?
Oh, no.
Yes.
What in the reverse Porky's is going on here?
You know, Doreen speaks six languages.
You should hear her order wine in French.
Hey, honey, say, "cabernet sauvigonenon".
Pierce, you're embarrassing me.
You know a lot about wine?
Well, I did have a client who owned a vineyard in Napa.
He was into S&M and merlot so we called it S&M&M.
Honey, you're boring the crap out of Jeff.
Be right back.
I have to make tinkles.
Well then, I'm gonna go get us another round.
You know, you are not what I expected.
You're smart, you're classy, you're not wearing go-go boots.
They're in the shop.
You know, despite what people think, I actually spend most of my time talking.
As men get older, they wanna spend time with someone they can have a real conversation with.
That is going to suck.
"Going to," Jeff?
Come on, Sabrina's cute, but she thinks that Monty Python is the evil snake from Harry Potter.
Trust me, I know girls I can converse with who are way more annoying.
I will take "tinkles" over "we need to talk" every time.
Hey, babe.
Ready to show me that Lexus?
I thought you'd never ask.
Doreen, it was very nice to meet you.
You can do better.
Here.
Oh, they already left?
What a couple of nincompoops.
Before I buy dinner, I have to ask.
Is there any lovemaking on the table?
We're through, Pierce.
I'm gonna go to the bar and you can join me if you'd like.
And we can still have a lovely evening, but it will cost you 200 bucks.
That is a pretty big discount.
I had no idea alcohol would make people horny.
It makes me sleepy.
I don't Dean?
Yeah.
We have a 597 currently going on in your office.
in my office?
No.
Okay, I'm just gonna turn him around and we're gonna cover him up.
Okay, ladies, I am shocked at the reverse Porky's that has happened here.
I don't see what the big deal is.
Annie needed to look at the model of the pen Okay, the P-word has entered into play.
That's exactly why I wanted Gayle, our school counselor here, and Monique, who's keeping record, to ensure we discuss these sensitive topics in a legally appropriate manner.
I think everyone should say "penis" so we can take away the negative power of the word, yeah?
So everybody.
Penis.
She didn't say it.
Now why did you break in to see the penis?
Wow, I really do feel more comfortable saying that now, Gayle.
I just wanna focus on the girl who won't say "penis".
This is a judgment-free zone, so express yourself.
You know what?
I don't want to express myself.
I don't wanna sit in a room full of people and say the P-word.
I like being repressed.
I am totally comfortable being uncomfortable with my sexuality.
And maybe, just maybe, if everyone were a little more like me, we wouldn't have to have an STD fair.
You go, girl.
That's my pumpkin.
Mm-hm.
By the way, now that I've gotten a good look at one, I don't see what all the fuss was about.
A giant thumb in a turtleneck.
Whoop-dee-doo!
You have a really awesome body.
You probably hear that all the time.
Not as much as I should.
Ohh.
Professor.
What?
I'm not a professor.
But you're at Greendale and you're old.
I'm a student.
Yikers.
Yeah.
It's pretty much yikers for me too.
Well, I guess I can make an exception, professor.
You know, I can't do this.
What?
But this is your car.
Keep it.
But Yes, yes, yes.
How do you like those apples?
I don't like those apples.
I'm so upset.
It was just a fluke I won those other games.
Troy.
Wow, this may be the only STD fair to actually spread STDs.
Ha, ha.
Shut up, Ben.
Condom water balloon fight!
What the hell?
Dude, these are leaking.
Ho-ho-ho!
Oh, my God.
That's why you don't print things on condoms.
Everyone's getting preggers and it's all your fault.
Oh, man.
Troy, all the condoms are faulty.
As the best athlete on campus, I need you to run to my office and make an announcement before everyone leaves.
Dean, I am not the best athlete on campus.
Abed is.
I know you let me win the race.
But you didn't say anything.
That's because I wanted it to be true.
You're a really good friend.
No, Abed.
You are.
For the love of God, run.
Okay.
Go, Abed, go.
Before people sex one another.
There he is.
Back already.
Detail time?
I stopped.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I mean, she's hot.
I think this place is sapping my life force.
Oh, it's not Greendale, Jeff, it's you.
You're becoming more mature.
A man reaches a point in his life where he stops looking for a place to hang his underwear and starts looking for a place to hang his hat.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was waiting for that to become inappropriate or racist.
What happened to Doreen?
Oh, uh, she said if I wanted to continue, I would have to pay.
Oh, man, that is rough.
No, it was a wake-up call.
Doreen is a very special lady.
I did not treat her right.
I have stuff to work on, you know?
You'll get there.
We're both gonna get there.
Here's to being better men.
Cheers.
So can I borrow 200 bucks?
Tell Doreen I say hi.
You know, for 220, I can get I'll give you 250 if you don't finish telling me.
Now I can get it twice.
Ah, college.
Best years of our lives.
Oop.
Attention, Greendale students.
Don't use the condoms.
If you're going to have sex tonight, don't use condoms.
"The characteristic of an acid to donate or accept a proton" cannot be quantified for individual species.
Comparing two donor-acceptor systems, "the proton transposition HA plus H2O" Abed?
Yeah, Troy?
Can you get me a glass of water?
Sure.
Thank you, Abed.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Happy last day before winter break, Greendale.
Time to visit our loved ones.
Some of you will travel as far as three miles.
Don't forget to visit our winter wonderland, where we're giving away catalogues of next semester's classes.
Ha-ha-ha!
Whoa!
What's that sound?
Is that the tippy-tapping of secular boots on the roof?
Oh, well, it must be yet another sign that it 'tis the season, because rumor has it that non-denominational Mr. Winter is on his way to the student lounge.
I am so sick of the dean jamming his PCness down my throat.
Pierce, I'd like to commend you for letting that one go.
PCness.
Now I get it.
It sounds like penis.
I just got it too.
Well, it's still Christmas to all of us.
And I made you all a little gift, because you're like my new family.
"W.W.B.J.
D"?
If that stands for "What would Billy Joel do"?
I'll tell you right now, he'd write another crappy song.
Yeah, in your face, Billy Joel.
Who is that?
It stands for "What would baby Jesus do?
" And it's to remind us that the real meaning of this season is Christmas.
Oh, well, thank you, Shirley.
I'm gonna put that in the pocket closest to my heart.
No, no, no.
It's a bracelet, you put them on.
Everybody put them on.
Hey.
Hey.
You took all the Winter-Doodles.
What are you, a douche bag?
They're for my friends.
But there's a lot left.
No.
Only macadamia nut cookies.
I have a tree-nut allergy.
You should stay away from Christmas-tree-shaped cookies.
Ha-ha-ha!
That did not even make allergic sense.
What are you, an idiot?
Okay, we get it, you and the A-Team are awesome, now beat it.
Oh, look at that.
Pretty boy, standing up for bird-face over here.
Give me a Winter-Doodle.
If you're trying to be menacing, maybe don't call the cookie by its name.
Oh, you're funny, you're a funny man.
Wanna hear something funny?
Knock, knock.
My fist up your balls.
Who's there?
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry happy.
This ain't over.
There won't always be a dean around, all right?
Still waiting on those cookies, Abed.
Jeff protected my honor.
It was like My Bodyguard, but I was the kid from Meatballs, Jeff was from Full Metal Jacket, and the mustache guy was the brother of the guy in Entourage.
Thanks for dumbing that down for us.
You got it.
What's the deal, Jeff?
You leave your stones in your other suit?
Why didn't you rap that guy in the face?
For the same reason that I floss and keep my guitar in its case.
I'm over 23.
I'm proud of you for handling it peacefully, Jeff.
Like a certain little birthday boy.
Heh-heh-heh.
Real men turn the other cheek.
Let's see them.
Nonsense.
Men were wired to fight each other so women could choose the right mate.
No, the real reason men fight is to release their pent-up gayness.
That guy wasn't gay, he had a mustache.
You know what I have?
Finals.
Are we cramming for Spanish or not?
I need a 65 or I'm gonna flunk the class.
Why didn't you do the extra credit if you knew that you were failing?
Because doing more than the minimum work is my definition of failing.
Quick question.
Are you all coming to my Christmas party right after the final or are you stopping home to change into your Christmas outfits?
I guess I could wear one of my Hanukkah sweaters.
Ah.
Annie, I didn't know you weren't, um, Christian.
Yep, one might even say I'm Jewish.
Oh, that's good for you.
That's wonderful.
I respect all religions of the world.
I'm Muslim.
Jehovah's Witness.
Atheist.
The Lord is testing me.
Guys, this is a subject that breeds conflict, can we please?
What religion are you, Jeff?
I'm agnostic.
Agnostic.
Lazy man's atheist.
I'm born-again.
Oh!
We had a re-birthing ritual in my friend's hot tub.
I'm now a level five Laser Lotus in my Buddhist community.
That does not sound like Buddhism.
You sure you're not in a cult?
Just by asking me that question, you put me back down to a level four.
You now owe me Do you know how foolish you sound right now?
What else do you believe in, blood transfusions?
Jehovah's Witnesses are a type of Christian, right, Troy?
Yeah, but we don't celebrate birthdays or Christmas, and we can't drink.
But it helps.
So you're like a Muslim.
Assalamu alaikum.
Shama-lama-ding-dong.
Well, don't we have a diverse little family.
I say we open up this party to all faiths.
I brought my Star of Bethlehem, which led the wise men to the savior of all mankind.
And you guys can bring a little trinket or doodad from your philosophies.
Sounds good?
As an agnostic, I'm gonna bring my winning smile.
Ugh!
So boring.
Done.
Hee, hee!
Feliz navidad.
"True or falso or none of the above"?
That doesn't make any sense.
Hey, look at that, Forehead's taking a test.
Why don't you get going, Chuck Norris?
Did you just shoo me?
Why don't you just kiss him already?
Dude, I will shoo your nose down your throat.
Señor Chang, can you do something about this?
I'll allow it.
Qué pasa here, huh?
It's usted, dude.
Even I know that.
You picked the wrong day to correct my Spanish, No Sleeves.
It's on.
He's doing this for me.
He's my bodyguard.
You wanna dance?
To some show tunes?
No, I want to beat you, and I'm gonna enjoy it.
Because you're like this school.
You're obnoxious, cramping my style and you smell like french-fry oil.
I don't get it.
Three o'clock.
Bike rack, but not the one by the parking lot.
Right, the one by the trash cans, near the orange cones, where they're building the wheelchair ramp.
Yeah.
Best exam ever.
That guy's awesome.
So help me, if that jerkweed made me fail.
Well, I aced it, amigo.
That means cousin.
So, what's my role going to be?
Is there a key moment where I stand up for myself, take revenge?
Uh, maybe you should just hang back.
Yeah, I will.
In his face.
Whatever you do, don't tell Shirley about the fight.
She'll start in with all her mothery guilt-inducing powers.
You know what I mean?
No.
I'm wearing this Jesus bracelet because it gets me chicks.
I know guys like this Mike.
He used to be a nerd, now he's a meathead.
Dangerous combo.
Tyson, Lou Ferrigno, Rosie O'Donnell.
You're a pretty big dude.
You've probably got moves.
Yeah, I got some theories.
You've never been in a fight?
Technically, no.
I guess I'm too charming and likeable.
Call me a name.
I can't.
Mm.
Are you telling me you've never been punched in the face?
No, thank God.
This is the moneymaker.
First time I got punched in the face, I was like, "Oh, no".
But then I was like, "This is a story".
And a good one.
Yeah.
Every man should be punched in the face.
It's a rite of passage.
In my day, Friday night was smoke a doobie, feel up a gal and then get your teeth knocked out by a Republican.
Guys, the plan here isn't for me to get hit.
It's for me to hit him.
Oh, then it's settled.
We have to teach Jeffrey how to fight.
I know a few moves.
Troy, I assume you're handy with a switchblade.
Abed, you get back to the family tent, try to find a chicken for Jeff to chase.
Guys, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I think I got this.
Oh, well, look who it is.
We got Forehead, Old Head, Dumb Head and the Other Head.
See you at 3, Forehead.
Give me a snowman, dork.
See this, funny guy?
Huh?
Huh?
Classic Rosie.
Fight lessons in a half an hour?
Good plan.
# Joy to the world The Lord is come # # The Lord, the Lord, the Lord ## Hello.
Oh!
Is this your Hanukkah holder?
It's, uh It's pretty.
We'll just, uh Let's just put it here.
There we go.
That's nice.
So I can't believe I never knew you were a Jew.
I'd say the whole word next time.
So do you think everyone will start arriving soon?
I think they're gonna come after Jeff's fight.
After Jeff's what, now?
Jeff wants to fight that bully.
On Christmas?
Will you excuse me for a moment?
Can you finish the manger scene?
We know you were one of us.
What's up?
What's up?
What's up.
No, it's a question.
What's up?
What's up?
Not a real question, a rhetorical one.
You have the answer, he does not.
Then you give them the Forest Whitaker eye.
Oh, that's pretty good.
Okay, hold that stare.
There you go.
Hold it.
Then, look straight through his eyes and deep into his soul.
And then you move to Vermont.
I'm sick and tired of you saying that fighting is gay.
She's got a point.
In boxing, you fight for the purse and a belt.
I've gotta write a paper about that.
Let's see what we're working with.
Go ahead, throw a few at the old paws.
What are you?
A North Korean seamstress?
Not if that's bad.
Get mad, come on!
If it helps, think of me as somebody who annoys you.
That's it.
That's good.
Britta, put your blouse back on.
Ohh!
Ow!
This is not a game.
You gotta be ready for anything.
Dude, that is not cool.
Well, that foxy black girl thinks it is.
Hm?
Aah!
What are you doing?
Why she have to be black?
What is going on?
We're trying to get Jeff ready for the fight.
I couldn't think of another word.
Idiot.
He meant we were figh ting.
It is hard to think of another word.
You realize there's no way to take this than as a giant middle finger to the most important day of the year.
December 10th?
It's our Christmas.
And I'm having a party.
Due to my divorce, and my relatives picking sides, this will be the only Christmas party I throw this year.
Will you be there or will I have another family letting me down?
I told him not to fight.
He wouldn't listen.
I don't know what that is.
Jeffrey, I have two boys.
And when we have a serious discussion, I find that a brownie helps them to relax.
So why do you hate me and Jesus?
I don't think my brownie's working.
Please don't do something so ugly on a day so important to me.
Again, it's December 10th.
You think religion is stupid.
No, no.
To me, religion is like Paul Rudd.
I see the appeal and would never take it away from anyone, but I would also never stand in line for it.
And, look, the die has been cast with this crazy bully guy.
He picked on Abed, and he corrected my Spanish.
So you go to your party and I'll see you soon.
Jeffrey, I forbid you from fighting.
Well, you don't get to.
You're not my mom.
You're right, but if you show up for the fight, don't show up for my party.
Oh, come on, Shirley, don't be mad.
I'm not mad, I'm disappointed.
That's Mom for mad.
Oh, hash browns and applesauce, that's nice.
Oh, what is that interesting smell?
It's a traditional Muslim dish.
Looks delicious.
I'm guessing as a woman I won't be allowed to eat that.
That's too bad.
Oh, look, Britta brought what she believes in.
Nothing.
Where should I put my Buddha incense holder?
I'm pretty sure that's a bong.
Where's Jeff?
I guess he made his choice.
I wanna go to Jeff's fight.
As I told Jeff, no one that goes to the fight can come to my party.
He's dead to me.
And if any of you leave you'll be dead to me too.
Let's sing.
# Jesus is a friend of mine # # Jesus is a friend of mine # Everybody.
# Jesus is a friend of mine ## Come on, everybody.
You don't know it?
You're banning Jeff from the party?
That doesn't seem very Christian.
Well, that's an interesting point of view coming from an atheist.
I did my best to create a special Christmas for my one intact family.
And, ahem, this is the thanks I get?
Shirley, you are a guilt machine.
Mm.
And Annie knows a thing or two about guilt, am I right, Jew?
Say the whole word.
Jewie?
You would never catch a Jehovah's Witness saying "Jewie".
Tell it to the birthday cake you never got.
You know, there's an old Buddhist saying You are not a Buddhist, you are in a cult.
Suck it, Nietzsche.
Guys, everyone's faith is weird.
Let's just not talk about it.
Guys, guys.
Guys, guys, are we really gonna let religion divide us like this?
I think there's one thing we can all agree on.
I get 72 virgins in heaven.
No, that we would all like to have Jeff at this party.
Mm.
He can't come.
Mm-mm.
Shirley.
I get that this is your first Christmas since your husband left you.
And I don't know, maybe that's why you're being so stubborn, because you're trying so hard to recreate something that you're afraid that you've lost forever.
But if you really want us to be your second family, then you've gotta start treating us like one.
Even if that means supporting us when we do things that you don't agree with.
And you can start by rooting for Jeff while he rolls around on the ground, groping another man.
That's what I'm gonna do.
The cranberry sauce has real cranberries.
If this dude doesn't show up, we're definitely going to Applebee's.
Because I'm getting into a fight no matter what today, I'm telling you.
Oh, look who showed up.
Oh, check him out.
Ohh!
What's up, dude?
No backup today, huh?
Looks like grandpa and weirdo couldn't show up to get their teeth knocked out.
Can I ask you a question?
Are you perpetually on your way to the gym?
Dude, my life is a gym.
Well, what's up?
What's up?
What's up, man?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
Whoa.
Dude, what is that?
One sec, these are very expensive.
What is he doing?
All right.
Dude, you wear a bracelet?
Your name is Mike, right?
So?
Mike, I'm not gonna fight you.
I have a friend that believes this is the time of year where you put aside your differences and make peace.
Me?
I don't believe in any of that, but I do believe in friendship.
And as much as I hate you and the cast of Breakin', I have to ask myself, what would Shirley do?
Oh, no.
What would Shirley do?
I think that she would shake your hand and wish you a Merry Christmas.
Jeffrey.
Kick his ass.
Cavalry's here.
Shirts off, boys.
Come on, I'm being punk'd, right?
Kick them.
Come here.
Please, it's Christmas.
It's December 10th.
Ow!
Not the moneymaker, not the moneymaker.
Ow!
Ow!
You're welcome.

Oh.
It turns out, you Pause for dramatic effect.
- will be seeing me next semester.
No!
In Spanish 102, ha-ha-ha!
Because he passed, you know.
And I'm the only Spanish teacher.
Yay!
I meant about Jeff passing.
You being our Spanish teacher, eh.
Whoa.
Man, Mike got you good.
Actually, that was my present to Jeff.
Ha, ha.
I don't care.
I've got a mountain to shred.
Jeffrey, you're a man now.
How does it feel?
I got hit in the face, like, four times before you punched me.
Well, some people just don't know how to say thank you.
Pierce, thank you.
And thanks to all of you for showing up and having my back when we fought those fly dancers.
So, uh Ooh!

{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Ha-ha-ha.
Welcome back.
Hi.
Hello.
What did you do over break?
Oh, it's so awesome.
Me and Abed played this video game.
It's so dope.
It's a whole city.
You can drive anywhere.
You can rent an apartment.
Do taxes.
But don't get audited.
Because that's bad.
You could even enroll in community college.
Right now, it sounds as boring as real life, but it is not.
Vacations are wasted on the young.
You guys gotta get out there and see the world at some point or you're gonna miss your entire lives.
Where did you go, Britta?
Amsterdam, I think.
I'll know more when I find my camera.
Guess what happened to me.
Oh, Pierce, you became a grandfather?
No, I became even cooler.
These ironic T-shirts are all the rage.
Let's get one thing straight.
I wish I was still a lawyer, I'm only here because I'm hot for Britta, and I don't want to be anybody's friend.
Just kidding.
Bring it in here, you knuckleheads.
You know, I gotta say, I I took a look back at the guy I was last semester, and I realized, that guy was a drag.
No.
Good to hear you admit it, Jeff.
No, the truth is, this is a new semester, a new Jeff.
Greendale is where I am and I am gonna make the best of it.
Oh, that's nice.
You're like Hawkeye on M* A*S*H.
He kept his upbeat humor and charm, even in the 11 th year of the Korean War.
Yeah.
Well, don't go changing too much, Jeff.
I think we all like you just the way you were.
Well, I appreciate that, but Did you just teleport here?
No, I snuck in during the group hug.
You guys don't remember me?
Buddy, from Spanish class.
Yeah, it's Buddy from Spanish class.
I've never seen you before in my life.
I don't know you.
I've seen Buddy before.
He sits in the corner, next to the dead plant.
Thank you, Abed.
Sometimes I have a tendency to melt into the background.
It's just my body type, but I definitely know you guys.
From watching you all last semester grow together.
F. F minus.
Did you say S?
He said F. Who cheated?
I did it.
Britta cheated?
But why?
Give me back my bra, Annie.
Ugh.
I'm not even wearing a bra.
Ugh!
Ugh!
I don't even care who wins.
What?
I sleep a lot in class, that one might have been a dream.
Well, Buddy, as you know, we haven't had Spanish class yet, so this meeting was more just for catching up between friends.
I heard that.
Let's do it.
Well, maybe So, I Heh.
Sorry, Britta.
I'll go first.
Uh I'm sure you guys have a natural rapport and timing, and you know you're scared that adding a new member might throw everything off of its natural - rhythm, but I feel like I know you guys already.
So you know, let me in, just tell me the rules, and I will follow.
Well, you already broke the only rule I have.
The rule about worrying about rules.
That's what I'm saying too.
Yeah.
# Spanish studying is better # # When you're Buddy-ing around Yeah ## Hey, Jeff.
Hey.
Excuse me.
Um I received a text message about free Sephora samples?
Ha-ha.
It was me.
Ha-ha.
Sorry about the ruse, but I have something better than exfoliating soap to rub on you.
An opportunity.
Mm.
As you can see, I am resurrecting the Greendale Gazette Journal Mirror.
And we need a student editor.
Someone with a real world savvy that extends beyond how to huff the ink.
Actually, dean, I'm resolved to spend this semester being more This would be your office.
Relaxed and awesome.
This is the first desk I've seen in six months that doesn't have "Zeppelin Rules" carved into it.
And you get an English credit.
Well, that ain't bad neither.
I'm in.
Yeah.
Guys, meet your new editor.
Mr. Winger is very excited to help you bring a voice back to the campus.
Jeff, I need to take your picture.
Good, we got it.
Okay.
You guys knock yourselves out.
Welcome aboard, Jeff.
This is my article on the school's new water heater.
You've got chops, kid.
But we need your talent on a bigger story.
Pizza wars.
Who's got the best slice in town?
Start with Big Nick's.
Bring us a large with sausage.
You.
I heard a rumor that Riley's Liquor is selling to underage students.
So I need an undercover exposé.
Find out how much they'll sell you of anything cold and imported.
You expect me to watch you do that without telling on you?
That's a hard-hitting question, Annie.
Are you a reporter?
No.
They've got me editing the crossword because I'm a girl.
And because I love crosswords.
Well, now you love the streets.
You're my ace newshound.
Ace?
You can do that?
We can do anything we want.
It's Greendale.
Now go find me that story.
This character reboot is really gelling for you, Jeff.
That was all classic Hawkeye.
Sending soldiers out for liquor.
Slyly sidestepping the problematic scrutiny of Annie "Hot Lips" Edison.
Mm?
I should build you a still for making Hawkeye martinis.
Of all your pop cultural fixations, this is one I can work with, Abed.
Call me Radar?
When you've earned it.
Now, I know the news of Señor Chang's death over winter break was a shock to us all.
But we should take comfort in the fact that he did not suffer when his moped hit the side of that Arby's.
So sad.
But best semester ever.
Heh-heh.
Heh-heh.
Beat it.
All right.
That was a professional actress.
I am a man who can never die, and this has been your first taste of Spanish 1-0-dos the semester I get inside your cabezas.
# I am Señor Chang # # And I'm so ill # # This is a warning I can't be killed # # All in your cabeza Without a chaser # # Not another teacher With this much flavor, Chang ## Saw that coming.
Hey, guys.
See you in study group.
Hoo-aah!
Aah!
Uh, Jeff, can he really just decide he's one of us?
He throws off our balance.
We've got three chicks, three dudes, and now, two weirdoes.
Heh.
Sorry, Abed.
Not all weirdoes are bad.
Buddy might be a puckish agent of change that changes our lives for the better through a musical montage.
Or he could have a row of jars waiting for our genitals.
Yo, I need my genitals.
You know who you guys sound like?
Me, from last semester.
Cynical.
Elitist.
Oh.
Rakishly good-looking.
Thank you.
Well, we should at least get together to talk about membership policies, right?
Hey, don't ask me.
Dealing with problems ain't my job no more.
My new job is hanging out, having fun and cracking wise.
Oh, must be nice.
Suppose I decide that's my job?
Jeff.
I hope you've got an army of raisins, because I've got a major scoop.
In October, there was a free Toni Braxton concert on the quad You don't need to remind me.
And when a last-minute mix-up shifted the showtime by an hour, an anonymous text message went out alerting students of the change.
Okay.
Not okay.
Because the text message was sent exclusively to black students.
And one French kid named Lebron.
That's profiling.
This is front page juice.
I gotta find out who sent the text.
Have you called the number that sent it?
Well, nobody's that stupid, right?
Hello?
Um Wrong number.
No, no.
That was a good cover.
So whoever it is keeps hanging up, but he can't hide forever.
Annie the reporter.
Good times.
Listen up, I just want to say, thank you guys real much Real much?
Duh.
Thank you guys very much for this.
It's a dream come true.
Aww.
Now let's study some Spanish.
So for the essay, we conjugate Conjugate?
Conjugal.
Visit.
Ha-ha-ha.
Lame.
Okay, stick and move, stick and move.
Okay, so for the essay portion # Annie got an essay portion # # Annie gonna move Her luscious fanny all day long ## Hey, Buddy can sing, you guys.
Ha-ha-ha.
Well, that's great.
Annie's pretty young, we try not to sexualize her.
I'm sorry.
Whoa!
Okay, look, I did You know what?
It's your study group, and I don't know if you perceive it as something that could be improved but I do have some ideas.
Here's one right here.
Boom.
I was thinking, we could start saying, "You go, girl".
Not in a way that's, you know, oh, I'm so cool saying, "You go, girl".
But in a way that we're kind of winking at it.
Bottom line, you guys need a chubby, agile guy.
Did anyone see Paul Blart: Marl Car Paul Blart: Mall Cop.
I'm like that, okay?
I'm fat and I'm physical, okay?
And I'm strong, hmm, and I can kick.
Oh!
Dude, sorry.
Jeff, Jeff?
No, no, it's fine.
Just a little Little nosebleed, I get them when it's dry, or when my face gets kicked.
I'll get some paper towels.
Did someone say something about a meeting to discuss member policy?
I think it's obvious to everyone, that this Buddy fellow has a few fruit loops loose so I think no matter what we do, we gotta do it with grace and caution.
I say we keep Buddy in the group.
What?
I've given it a lot of thought and frankly I like his in-your-face style.
I can't stop thinking about his high kick.
His ratio of girth to hip flexibility is mesmerizing.
I like his idea of ironically saying, "You go, girl".
You go, girl.
You go, girl.
Wait, so you kick high enough and you get in the group?
If we're gonna add people, I really think we should consider my friend Gary.
I'm sorry, Shirley, you friend Gary is so boring.
He was raised in Finland, he doesn't get our humor.
So if we're gonna add a chair for every bong-ripping, good-time charlie, with a song in his heart, I move we institute hazing.
Well, in The Right Stuff, the novel by Tom Wolfe This is why we need new blood.
I'm so bored of your pop culture references, and your cigarette-legged jeans.
Uh, Gary wears nothing but loose-fitting jeans.
Gary is off the table.
He is a buzz kill.
He grew up in a land without sun.
Take a vote.
They'd probably vote him in.
They won't.
Guys.
Guys, let's take a vote.
Secret vote, everybody cover your eyes.
We won't know the result.
Say your vote out loud.
We'll know each ether's voices.
Troy's got a point.
Holy crap.
Wow.
It says here, some guy in Seattle went nuts and killed his entire driver's ed class with a meat tenderizer.
Oh, no.
We have to be careful.
Okay.
On the count of three, everybody who wants to keep Buddy out, raise your hand.
You lied about the guy in Seattle with the meat tenderizer.
You put your thumb on the scale.
You did it with a smile and you did it so you could keep smiling.
You're Hawkeye.
And with Buddy gone, staying that way will be a lot easier.
I am not racist.
I had 20 minutes to let people know Toni Braxton was starting early and 273 text messages left before my rate tripled.
Racial profiling may not be right, but it can be economical.
Tell me, dean, when I refer to you in my article, would you prefer imbecile or incompetent?
I'd prefer incompetent, but what I really want It doesn't matter what you want.
The people want the truth, I have to give it to them, and I won't let anyone stand in my way.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Hey, Jeffrey.
I'm the least racist person in the world.
My best friend, when I was Okay, look.
I've learned my lesson.
I've got unlimited texting now.
But if she runs that story, I will lose this job, and this job is my life.
She listens to you.
Well, next time we're both hanging out, having fun, I could try cracking wise about it with her.
You do what you think is right.
That's enough.
Okay.
I'm just saying, it's not exactly Watergate.
I mean, you like the dean, he's trying to help you transfer.
Yeah, and this time, he might succeed.
If this article breaks out, I can apply for journalism scholarships.
Nobody will care about my time in rehab if they think I'm a writer.
Annie, as your upbeat friend, I gotta say, let this go.
This is Greendale, Jeff, we can do whatever we want.
# I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm so damn sorry # # I'm sorry, I'm sorry # # Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry # # I'm so sorry ## Didn't anyone tell Buddy he was out?
I guess we thought you would.
My lord, my lady, you missed my apology song.
Yeah, I'll I'll tell them about it later.
Jeff, I am so sorry about the other day.
Buddy, yesterday, the group took a vote.
And you seem to have figured out the rest of it.
Was it the high kick?
Was it, "You go, girl"?
Oh, you guys think you're so cool.
No, we don't think we're cool at all.
Just a bit.
I put myself out there for you.
I laid my soul bare.
I made you guys lemon squares with free-range eggs that I baked with my own hands.
Maybe a little less sugar next time.
Well, I'm not leaving.
Oh, come on.
Be relaxed, like me.
Leave.
You're not relaxed.
You're an uptight puppet master.
And these are your little puppets.
I am no man's puppet, sir.
How dare you.
Buddy, just be reasonable and go.
Make me, Hitler.
Oh.
Okay, so, uh, so since Buddy's not leaving, he'll just be the person who we wish wasn't here while we study.
Try getting that deal from Hitler.
Shall we?
I'm studying with you.
No, you're not.
Everyone stop studying.
Okay.
You're not in the group.
Okay, then go study somewhere else.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, I wanna study with you guys.
No.
No.
I hate you.
I hate your study group.
I hate it.
You suck.
I hate you.
And you are not running that story.
Why not?
Because I said so.
Does anybody have a problem with how that was handled?
It's okay.
Exactly the way I would've done it.
You suck.
Who are you kidding, Abed?
I just dragged a screaming, crying man out of a library with his pants down.
No.
Martinis are for Hawkeyes.
I'm the same uptight jerk I was last semester.
Jeff, what's your favorite episode of M* A*S*H?
The one with, uh, the Army.
That's what I thought.
If you had actually seen the show you'd know that Hawkeye didn't just bed nurses and drink martinis.
He also had blood sprayed on his face and barked orders when the choppers came in.
If he didn't, people died.
He was a leader, Jeff.
That's your job.
Yeah?
What's in it for me?
Hey.
Annie.
I I'm sorry that I yelled.
I'm glad you did.
It didn't even really occur to me what I was doing until I saw how upset you were.
I never want to be the reason you're mad, because you're Jeff Winger.
So thanks for getting mad.
It was nothing.
I guess that's the upside, isn't it?
Thank you, Radar.
Ooh.
You made me so happy I just peed a little.
I don't think violence is the answer when we make decisions.
Hi, guys.
Hi, Buddy.
Can you, um?
Excuse us?
For one crazy stalker?
Listen up, we outnumber this guy six to one.
Annie, you flash your breasts as a decoy for the bumrush.
Pierce?
Britta, don't be upset.
I didn't pick you as a decoy because your breasts are so old.
Why is he even here?
Hello.
I invited him.
Buddy's crime is thinking we're cool.
But I get it.
I mean, if I were him, and I missed out on you guys, I'd be sitting in that classroom, watching, wondering.
So how can I exclude someone from something that I'm so lucky to have.
Oh.
I say we let him in.
Hey, Buddy.
Welcome to the group.
Oh, yes.
You will not regret this.
There he is.
Hey, Buddy, the group thought about what you said.
We took a vote.
And you're in.
No way.
I'm in the cool group?
It's like Christmas morning for the guy.
Welcome.
This is Oh, this is awkward.
You guys were my safety.
Pfft.
Hey, hey, Buddy, you don't have to worry about them.
You're with us now.
Come on.
Ha-ha!
Boo!
It's amazing.
I love the kicks.
The kicks are the best.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I voted to keep him.
Would have been nice to have another person in the group.
I'll call Gary.
So it says here you want to join as a twosome?
I don't see that as a selling point.
We work really well together.
Yeah.
Let me hear that rap thing of yours again.
All right.
I'm gonna talk it over with the others.
Cool, thanks for your time.
You traitors.
I am appalled at your lack of loyalty.
Yeah, you better run.
Have you decided?
We saw your tape.
We're passing.
I don't pop on video.
Let me do the song in person.
# Getting rid of Britta # # Getting rid of the B # # She's a GDB # # She's a no-good B ##
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Before we start, I'd like to have a preliminary powwow, or prelimi-wow, about what I'm calling our library's back door conundrum.
Sounds like a porno with Kate Winslet.
Abed, ew.
The door on that side is locked after 5, which means that most us have to walk all the way around.
Now if we were to move our meetings to 4:30 No.
I have a regular class at that time.
It's like Math or other regular classes.
Yeah.
I have something unimportant that can't ever move.
Well, maybe one of us could stand by the back door and let the rest in?
Mm.
I nominate Pierce.
Where is he?
I have not seen him around all day.
I haven't either.
Has anyone called him?
I did.
Several times, actually.
But he never returned my calls.
Oh, no.
Oh.
The last thing I said to him was, "Suck it".
Me too.
Good morning.
Ha-ha-ha.
Yes.
Oh, thank God.
Whew.
You thought I was dead, didn't you?
No.
I did.
Do you people have any idea how emasculating that is?
I'm not Mickey Rooney.
You don't have to cross your fingers to see if I'll show up.
You know, when I was 30, people used to wish that I was dead to my face.
That's called respect.
Mm.
Who is the lucky brunette?
Last name Beeswax, first name Nunnuyuh.
Oh, my third wife was biracial.
Stop it.
I am trying to keep you out of trouble.
What if the next girl saw these?
Well, then she would know it was hers.
Jeff, you're sleeping with a woman you already slept with?
Can't I be the friend in the group whose trademark is his well-defined boundaries?
Like Privacy Smurf, Discreet Bear or Confidentiality Spice?
Why would you keep her a secret?
Don't you want us to meet her?
We have an agreement to keep it low-key.
That's ridiculous.
Obviously, it's a guy.
You're wrong, Pierce.
It's two guys.
Sometimes I do wish you were dead.
Thank you.
Hey, what's up, man?
Boo!
Hey, what's up, J-Dog?
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Hey, what's up, man?
What's up?
Sorry I'm late.
Uh, and step into place.
Six, seven, eight, and reach.
Two, three, four, pose.
Reach back and arm.
Professor Slater, quick question.
You know the answer.
I don't date students.
Even if you are no longer in my Statistics class.
I'm actually kind of seeing someone right now, thank you very much.
Really?
How's that going?
Fine for now.
She's smart, pretty.
But sometimes I feel like she's just waiting for me to stop talking and take off my pants.
She is.
I've never been someone's dirty little secret.
I've never had a dirty secret.
It's so unprofessional.
But the sneaking does make the sex 38 percent hotter.
Wow, you do like statistics, don't you?
Hey, midterms and whatever.
Chalk.
Professor Slater, there's that transcript you wanted.
Jeff, I didn't expect to see you here.
Hopefully I'm not interrupting.
You know, we laugh, but the fact is, student-teacher relationships do happen.
And they are a magnet for lawsuits, so we do stay vigilant.
In fact, physically attractive students and faculty are actually placed on a watch list.
And are ranked by their potential to incite fraternization.
You rank people by how hot they are?
You got it, number two.
Dean Pelton.
Yes, Professor Seven Uh, Slater?
I'll return this tomorrow.
Okay, then.
You guys be extra careful now.
Two people of your rankings in this small a room, with this type of lighting, and his upper body and what her heels and hemline are doing to enhance what were already quite a few favors from God, it's all the more important to keep it tasteful.
Heh.
I think he might have ruined It's dead.
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Arm, head, and pose.
I can't wait for the recital.
You were all wonderful.
Especially you, Troy.
Thank you, Madame LeClair.
And if any of you mention my dancing outside of class, I will break off your legs and use them to smash in your friends' cars.
Oh!
Huh!
Oh, my God.
Troy, since when have you taken modern dance?
Since last semester.
Coach told me it would help with my coordination.
And I fell in love with it, in a very straight way.
I know it's tempting to sneak a peek, but I'm gonna need for you to keep your eyes up here.
I should have never dismissed you as a shallow jock.
Then again, we haven't really spent much time together.
That's because you don't play football or have fun.
I have fun tap dancing.
I started last semester too.
It was always something I wanted to do, but it was too embarrassing, so I never told anyone.
Same here.
Britta, nobody can know about this.
Troy, who are we kidding?
Look at how much time and energy we're putting into hiding something that we're passionate about.
We are leading a double life.
I am spending a lot of money on breakaway clothing.
We should look at this as an opportunity to come clean.
Are you saying we tell the group?
Together?
We could invite them to the dance recital on Friday.
Man, I don't know.
Let me think about it.
Okay, let's do this.
Ahem!
Sorry.
Mr. Winger.
Would you come to my office?
We never finished our intercourse.
I have study group right now.
And nobody uses "intercourse" to mean anything other than sex.
Look, this is a wall of windows.
My study group's behind it.
I know.
Look, as soon as we touch, the blinds will open, and six annoying but lovable misfits will be staring at us.
Come on, what are the odds?
Fine.
Now, was that so bad?
Hey, could you open the back door?
You all remember Michelle Slater, my professor from last semester.
As most of you may have realized by now, she's the woman I've been seeing lately.
Why are they looking at me like I'm a zoo animal?
Jeff acts as sort of the dad of the group.
So, emotionally, this is like being told you're our new mom.
But you know it's nothing like that, right?
Absolutely.
You cook macaroni?
I have.
Macaroni's my favorite.
The important thing is we all understand Professor Slater and I need this to be our little secret.
Everyone understand that?
Yes.
Hey, my macaroni noodle is so good.
Sure, sure.
The pepper jack, and you bake it.
See?
All good.
Well, thank you, everyone.
I appreciate it.
I should get going.
Yeah.
Mm.
Ooh.
Bye.
Bye.
Well, Jeff, you've taken a big step in knocking down the barriers between students and teachers.
It's like Rosa Parks.
I don't think it's like that.
No, it's just like that.
I feel if you need to explain it, it's not just like that.
Is your heart gonna be okay with this?
I will try to find the tools to survive.
Okay.
Hey, everybody, speaking of secrets, Troy and I have something that we would like to announce.
Aah!
No, no.
There is a dance recital on Friday, and I would be honored if you guys would attend.
Because since last semester, I have been taking a tap class.
That's funny.
Well, I don't know how funny it is.
Come on, we're not making fun of you, but, obviously, you kept it a secret because you saw the irony too.
Irony?
Well, you're not a typically vulnerable or feminine person.
And the act of dancing is considered both vulnerable and feminine.
I disagree.
What about Fred Astaire?
What about Baryshnikov?
Yeah, I guess.
There are exceptions to the rule.
But even when Jerry Rice went on Dancing With the Stars Jerry Rice?
Oh, my God.
Oh, I liked him.
Troy, what's your secret?
Um M-my secret is that I knew Britta's secret.
Yeah.
I saw her in her dance outfit and she looked ridiculous.
So I helped her protect her shame.
You know, I'm just glad she's out now.
Bravo, Britta.
Thanks.
Mr. Winger, there you are.
Just got word of your relationship with Professor Slater.
I'd like to see both of you in my office in half an hour.
None of you left the room.
How is that even possible?
Well, for one thing, it's all over Twitter.
Britta in a tutu.
Can you imagine?
Ha-ha-ha.
Hey.
What the hell?
I thought we were supposed to come out to the group together.
Yeah.
I changed my mind.
Well, they're gonna find out that you dance at the recital.
I'm not gonna be in the recital.
I'm dropping the class.
Oh, my God, how can you do this to me?
I'm so disappointed in you.
Hey, you don't get to talk to me like that.
You are not Shirley.
And Shirley's not my mom.
Britta, it's not like we were in the same boat.
Girls are supposed to dance.
That's why God gave them parts that jiggle.
But I'd be going from starting quarterback to a guy that twirls around in tights.
I've got way more to lose getting up on that stage because I'm a man.
Well, guess what?
A real man doesn't bail on his friends, or on himself.
You're a dancer, Troy.
It's who you are.
Not anymore.
Excuse me.
Whoa.
Come on.
Upset about Jeff?
No, I am upset about something I can't talk about.
We could talk about anything.
Politics, medicine, Jeff.
Okay, uh, did you hear that the Shroud of Turin is actually?
Here's the thing about Jeff.
Wow.
Chasing after you made him a better person because you always call him on his stuff.
All this time, you've been warming him up and stirring in sweetener, and making him just right.
And sure, you weren't ready to take a sip yet.
But it didn't mean you want somebody to snatch him off the counter, guzzle him down in front of you.
Shirley, I did not warm Jeff up.
Nobody ever will.
Do you think Professor Slater is getting flowers right now?
Do you think they are gonna go to the movies and hold hands?
Visit her parents?
No.
The only thing keeping them going was the thrill of the secrecy.
And now that it is out, it is over.
Believe me.
Can Can I just ask, as a divorced, black housewife?
What part of being a single, white slacker makes you people so jaded?
Ooh.
"You people"?
What do you mean, "you people"?
I cannot believe I got to say that.
Heh-heh.
It's the little things, isn't it?
Okay, well, now that your secret is out there, I'm just gonna talk you through this teacher-student relationship form, and then we can get you two on your very attractive way.
We haven't even admitted to being a couple.
In fact, this is all based on hearsay.
Worse than hearsay.
Pierce's Twitter account, in which he says he's 47, and teaches a women's-only Pilates class.
Jeff, it's okay.
It's out.
And you know what?
It doesn't bother me.
I'm happy.
Sweet.
Mm.
First question.
How long have you been doing it?
Oh, not "it".
I mean, this, dating.
A few weeks.
Mm-hm.
And how long have you been doing it?
We don't have to answer that.
Oh, it's Hmm?
Now, this is just hypothetical.
Might you ever consider spending the night with a third person?
That's not on there.
Uh Wow, it's on there.
Just exploring your options, obviously.
Heh-heh-heh.
No agenda.
I'll put TBD.
Would you describe yourself as boyfriend and girlfriend?
Yes.
Eh What?
Oh, boy.
It's semantics, really, isn't it?
We've slept together every night for the last three weeks.
How would you describe me?
The best friend ever.
Oh.
Well, uh I guess I've had the wrong idea about us.
You know what, this is good.
I'd be better off dating, um, an adult.
See you around.
Michelle.
Rowr.
I'll get the breakup form.
I got freaked out by that boyfriend label.
I'm afraid of commitment.
How original.
Look, the biggest truths aren't original.
Truth is ketchup, it's Jim Belushi.
Its job isn't to blow our minds, it's to be within reach.
So the truth is, I get claustrophobic when things get official.
You're acting like I'm a Venus flytrap.
I didn't want or need more than what we were doing.
Let's get back to it.
Should I get the door?
I can't now because you went to the friend place.
That's you getting official, not me.
Because unless there's something I need to know about the lunch lady, or that blond in your Spanish class with the infinite supply of leather jackets, somewhere between our ninth and 11 th slumber party, statistically speaking, most people would call us more than pals.
Yeah, but soon as you say it, it can get complicated and messy.
How?
Because when you say it, later on, you might have to unsay it.
Whoopee flipping ding, Winger.
It happens 50 million times a day.
It's the Jim Belushi of sexual commitments.
It barely means anything, and it grows on what's there over time.
Wow, that guy is really taking a pounding in this conversation.
I'll see you around, Jeff.
I really liked what we were doing.
And if the ratio of work to pleasure can really stay at that same level, I don't care what it's called, I'll do it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
That's a big crowd out there.
Heh.
Abed's really good at inviting people.
We're all here to support you.
Jeff even brought his girlfriend.
Oh, she's his girlfriend now?
Can't wait till he hears about it.
Oh, he knows.
They even had to file paperwork with the dean.
It's pretty serious.
Our little Jeff's growing up.
Ha.
Oh Break a leg, Britta.
I have no idea how someone could do what you're about to do.
Heh-heh.
I brought Goobers.
Anybody want a Goober?
Get them while they're goobie.
Yeah.
Showtime.
Well, this is already ridiculous.
Shh.
"Tea for Two"?
There There's five people.
Shh!
Good Lord.
Is she a water pot or a tea kettle?
Shh.
Any of you think the flowers are dying from the tea?
Shh!
Everyone can hear you.
Britta.
Water it.
What's going on?
So embarrassing.
Oh, plot twist.
Easy girl.
There we go.
Uh Uh Ah!
Uh Thank you.
Yeah.
Play something modern.
What are you doing here?
Being a friend and a man.
Oh, thank you.
Ah Aah-aah!
It's okay.
Culturally, it's unacceptable, but it's theatrical dynamite.
Hah.
Whoo!
Bravo.
Whoo.
Yeah, all right.
Greendale.
Greendale.
Hi, guys.
That was really cool.
I wish I knew how to tap dance.
Oh.
Thanks, Abed.
It takes a lot of hard work, but you could take a class.
Hmm, pass.
Hey, Troy, thank you.
No, thank you.
I mean, you looked so pathetic, you made going up there the most masculine option.
Mm.
Troy.
Oh.
What you did up there really took guts.
I'm impressed.
Thanks, Pierce.
Yeah.
And such a creative way to tell the world you're gay.
Good job up there.
Thank you.
Where's your date?
Didn't she wanna get my autograph?
Oh.
She's getting a permission slip from the dean to allow us to drive home together.
Heard you guys are official now.
Yeah, I guess.
You actually had a big part in that.
I mean, if I can handle having a girl for a friend, who's to say I'm not ready for a girlfriend?
Makes perfect sense.
Break a leg.
Flowers.
Yeah.
Uh, is that?
That's what people do, right?
I was gonna throw them up on stage, but I thought they might catch fire.
No, this is This is good.
You can hand them to me.
Thank you.
See you Monday.
Bye.
Good night, everybody.
Five letters, Broadway musical.
Annie.
Uh, six letters, to puncture.
Pierce.
Um, a water filter that starts with B. Britta.
Okay.
There's a tough one, though.
Um, Helen of Troy.
Oh, damn, you're good.
Thank you.
I never even heard of that last one.
All right, uh, one of the two brother actors, Bridges, four letters.
Hmm.
I know.
Bridges.
I don't know.
Come on, guys, can't you see the pattern there?
Can you see it?
It's Beau, Beau Bridges.
These are all things you can see on TV.
Except for pierce, that's a misdirect.
Oh.
Oh.
I love misdirects.
I love The Big Lebowski.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Missed you at lunch today.
Did you slip out for a quickie with Prof.
Hot Stuff?
Her name's Michelle and how did you know?
There's a gold star on your fly.
Ah!
Heh.
You weren't kidding.
You know it's nice to have a girlfriend with a sense of humor and one who recognizes good work.
See, that's G. That's the most important chord.
In my mind, it It stands for God.
Why is Annie talking to Micro-Nipples?
Vaughn?
Whatever.
But not like a Bible God because I think that God is in everything.
You're complicated.
# Annie # # Annie, where you going today?
# Spanish class.
# Spanish ## You know what I don't get?
He never wears a shirt.
He never wears shoes.
Why hasn't he died from lack of service?
You watching another movie in your dorm tonight?
Kickpuncher starring Don "The Demon" Donaldson as a cyborg cop whose punches have the power of kicks.
That sounds awful.
I'll bring the popcorn.
Cool.
Uh You You watch bad movies on purpose?
Yeah, we make fun of them.
Hmm.
Shirley, don't embarrass yourself.
I'm sure they don't want to invite the housewife.
Actually, if she doesn't mind reinforcing the stereotype, I bet Shirley would have fun talking smack in a movie.
Care to join us?
Usually when a movie's bad, I stop watching, but this sounds college-y.
What time do you want us there?
Pierce, you don't wanna watch a cyborg movie in Abed's dorm.
You wanna lay in your twin bed and think about what you used to be.
What, you think I'm too old to make monkeyshines at a picture show?
Come on, I'm younger than the three of you put together.
Hey, Britta.
You know, everyone talks about his nipples, but his feet freak me out.
Britta.
Hey.
Hey.
Can I ask you something?
About Vaughn?
Oh, yes, I still don't know if that's his first or last name.
Uh, heh.
He's sweet, actually.
I mean, you must have thought so.
He has a sincerity I found attractive in a simpler time.
Would you?
Um, I haven't We haven't Anything.
I mean Wow, you and Vaughn?
Would it bug you?
Well, what about you and Troy?
Troy?
The other day after Spanish, I thought he was trying to hold my hand but he had just mistaken me for Abed.
Heh.
He'll never think of me that way.
Well, Annie, I would have to be a villain to tell you who to date.
Which I am not.
Britta, thank you.
You're the coolest girl I've ever met.
Damn right, give me some fivesies.
Heh.
Whoo.
Turning it into a snake.
Oh, cool.
Hey, how's it going?
Did you hear?
It's cute, Annie and Vaughn.
Get to the cute part.
She's into him.
She asked for my blessing.
And you gave it?
Yeah, I'm done with him.
Look, this isn't about you, you groovy hipster.
It's about Annie.
We're like her Greendale parents, you gotta say no to that stuff.
He's not that bad.
Yeah, not if you're 28 and you're fooling around with him.
She's 18.
Her taste in men is still being established.
Creepier and creepier dudes will start thinking of her as an option.
And it all starts with Vaughn.
He's a gateway douche bag.
People collide, things happen.
It can't be controlled, right?
And that can be your toast at her shotgun wedding to Star-Burns.
Oh, yeah, turn to your left.
Oh, now turn to your right.
Yes, we can see both of them.
It's like a constellation on your face.
Hey.
Oh, what's up, dude?
Yeah.
That guy over there?
He's a douche bag.
Hey, guys.
I hope you don't mind I invited Señor Chang, we're Netflix friends.
Oh, that's cool you're hanging out, drinking beers with your students.
Yeah, clearly none of my other plans fell through.
Let's get to the movie.
Wait Oh, I'm sorry, Shirley.
I'll wait if you wanna serve beverages.
You're going to be waiting a long ass time.
Oh, FBI warning, I'm so scared.
Hey, that's not fair.
I didn't know we started.
It is the year 2006 A.D. And nuclear war has ravaged the planet.
I must have missed that.
Nice.
- between cities is a free-fire zone, ruled by scavengers, drug dealers and terrorists.
Sounds like a Thanksgiving at my house.
Troy, you're crazy, man.
Yeah, I know.
They just come to me.
You want to buy some megadope?
It gets you mega high.
Will it get me through this movie?
There she goes.
Shirley's in the house.
Freeze, police.
Freeze police?
Don't do that, they'll get cold.
Ha-ha-ha.
Kickpuncher.
You've done so much for our city.
Kickpuncher, is there anything that we can give you?
Yeah, two hours of my life back.
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh!
Don't call me Kickpuncher.
Call me David.
"Directed by Kim Yang".
Asian, can't direct, can't drive.
Dude, I'm right here.
Right there.
So.
Clearly we're all a bunch of funny people.
When are we doing this again?
Well, actually, tomorrow we No.
We were all gonna get I wouldn't.
Right?
Tomorrow night, we're all gonna get together and watch Kickpuncher 2: Codename Punchkicker.
Well, I was warming up tonight.
Tomorrow you better foam the runways because I'm bringing my A game.
Awesome.
All right, so check it.
It's just like surfing without water.
All right, your turn.
Get up there, come on.
Heh-heh.
I'm # Annie's gonna ride # Oh, my God.
# Annie's gonna ride the wave # He's got her in some kind of hippie collar.
I can hear her armpit hair growing from here.
We've got to do something.
Okay, even if I agreed with you, what are we gonna do?
Let's just center ourselves.
There it is.
We say we disapprove, we'll just drive her further into his hemp-braceleted arms.
We need to be smart, to need to hatch a scheme.
Hmm.
Hatching schemes is not really my wheelhouse.
Let's not confine ourselves to your wheelhouse.
This problem won't respond to tap dancing or casual revelations that you spent time in New York.
Okay, if you're gonna get Upper East Side about this, I think we're done.
Hey, Winger, check out Annie.
Somebody just went to the top of my to-do list.
Okay, we need to hatch a scheme.
Thank you.
It's all very simple.
In Annie's world, long before Vaughn, she only had eyes for Troy.
So if Troy becomes a real option, Annie will drop Vaughn in a hippie's heartbeat.
Crash course in manipulation.
You don't actually tell the person what you want them to do.
You help them realize they want to do it so it can't be traced back to you.
Hmm.
Got it.
Chemistry, sexy.
You know what else is sexy?
Annie.
I know Chemistry is sexy, but Annie?
I don't see it.
Well, every other guy on campus does.
You really don't see how pretty Annie is?
Maybe it's because I knew her back in high school before she dropped out.
She had braces and acne and a pill addiction.
A nervous breakdown ending with her running through a plate glass door screaming: "Everyone's a robot".
I see what's happening here.
Troy, I want you to clear your head.
Done.
I'm gonna describe to you a complete stranger who happens who happens to be in our study group.
Would you excuse us for a moment?
Annie?
No kidding?
Come on, you gotta be exaggerating.
Oh, man.
Ahem.
And she's Jewish?
I can't believe I didn't see that.
Well, I guess she deserves another shot.
Oh, wait.
Never mind, it's too late, I heard she's hooking up with Vaughn.
Only to make you jealous.
What?
She's helplessly in love with you, she's only with Vaughn to get your attention.
And you have to give it to her now, right, Jeff?
Sure.
But the point is we're not telling you what to do.
Oh, yeah, you didn't hear it from us.
Boo-ya.
I have the weirdest boner.
I saw you die.
How can you be alive?
I guess it's just a bad day for drug-dealing terrorists.
And a good day for Kickpuncher.
All right, guys, you hear that pause after he says, "And a good day, "?
What do you got for me there?
A good day for a nutritious breakfast.
I don't get it.
It's a good day for a terrible movie.
A good day for hair products?
Oh, Buzz, how many times can you keep going to go to that well?
Come on, guys, I'm starting to wonder if you deserve to call yourselves a community college sketch comedy troupe.
I told you, on movie night I need to blow these punks out of the water.
I need Phyllis Diller-grade stuff.
Wouldn't you rather just watch a movie with your friends and have a good time?
What are you, my third wife's therapist?
What if he said, "It's a good day for," And you said, "For being gay"?
You are a genius.
He likes gay jokes.
What?
I said we write great jokes.
Don't flatter yourselves.
Whoa.
Hey, Annie, it's me, Troy.
Oh, I don't know where Abed is.
I can try calling him if you want.
No, I'm not looking for my other half.
I'm looking for you, girl.
Oh.
Yeah, let that sink in for a second.
Mm.
You know, I never noticed how beautiful you are.
Troy, you're being weird.
Sorry it took me so long.
They made me find a s-shirt.
Vaughn, you remember Troy.
Um, we went to high school together and he's in my study group.
Hey, what's up, man?
Hi, bro.
Heh.
I'm not your bro, bro.
Oh, well, actually, everyone is my bro in the whole entire universe because everything is connected.
Rocks, eagles, hats.
Yeah, but some things are more connected than others like tarantulas and me peeing my pants.
Or me and Annie.
What, wait.
Troy?
What?
Tell him.
Tell him that you've been in love with me since high school.
What?
Wait a minute, is that true, Mountain Flower?
No.
I mean Ugh.
I never wanna lie to you.
So I will tell you, I did have feelings for him but it's over, I swear.
You swear?
Like Britta swore that she didn't like Jeff.
Then gave him a copy of my poem so he could laugh at me with that Sherri Shepherd lady?
It's happening again.
Your study group is evil.
And you don't deserve ice cream.
Well, he's a baby.
Now, where were we?
Ugh!
I like him.
Why would you do that?
Come on, everybody knows you want a cut of the T-Bone steak.
Ugh.
Jeff and Britta told me how you feel.
Wait.
Jeff and Britta did what now?
Oh, you're even hotter when you're angry.
Let's do this.
Red Shoe Diaries.
I think you know I have a thing for butt stuff.
To Annie's inevitable breakup with Grodie J. McConaughey.
And to her and Troy.
We did the right thing.
They belong together.
Plus, their babies will be so cute.
Why would you say that?
Come on.
You know that babies are extra cute when the parents are Both cute?
Do you want kids?
We'll see.
Put on something nice and find me after lunch.
Hey, guys.
Thanks for getting involved in my love life.
That was super cool and mature of you.
Oh, and since you're both clearly idiots, I should probably let you know that I'm being sarcastic.
Hey, guys, thanks for taking ugly Annie out of the palm of my hand.
And turning her into yet another hottie that will never get with me.
Hey, guys, thanks for eating all the macaroni.
Shut up, Leonard, nobody even knows what you're talking about.
I did eat all the macaroni.
It's messed up that he knows.
Let's light this candle.
Who's ready for some Kickpunching?
Actually, we decided to watch Runaway instead.
Tom Selleck fights mechanical spiders.
What?
No, no, you can't do that.
We just watched Kickpuncher, we have to see Kickpuncher 2.
I have so many unanswered questions.
No, I wanna watch Tom Selleck fight mechanical spiders.
Yes.
Yeah.
My brother died on the set of that movie.
One of the mechanical spiders just went haywire and tore him to pieces.
And Tom Selleck just stood there.
He just stood there and watched him die.
Okay, then, let's watch your Kickpuncher 2 then.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry for your loss.
Yeah.
That's messed up, dude.
Kickpuncher 2.
My punches were only as strong as my punches.
And then things changed.
Change?
Time to change the channel.
This guy's gonna be begging for change if he keeps making movies this bad.
Heh-heh-heh.
They should change this movie to something good.
This movie stinks, we better change its diaper.
Heh.
That's change we can believe in.
Okay, obviously something strange is happening here.
What do you mean?
I'm making jokes during a movie.
Yeah, but you're doing it with the speed and determination of the incomparable Robin Williams.
Yeah.
Maybe I'm just that brilliant.
I think you came prepared.
Dude, even I know you're lame.
And I'm a tenured professor sitting in a beanbag chair.
You're not a professor.
Shut up, man.
Fine, you got me.
I did a little advanced work.
Pathetic?
No.
I'll tell you what's pathetic.
You all sitting here making fun of other people's work.
You don't feel good about yourselves so you have to tear down everything around you.
What's the matter?
Mama Chang didn't breastfeed?
She read in a book that it wouldn't make a difference.
You all sicken me.
And I will no longer participate in your destructive, negative behavior.
Pierce, that was deep.
And total BS.
Yeah, this isn't about us.
This is a deflection because you can't get a genuine laugh.
Mm-hm.
That, in itself, is a laugh.
I know I'm funny and I don't need any of you people to validate me.
Hmm.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Biggest laugh of the night.
Yes, it was.
Totally.
Then I was going to say, "It's a good day to be gay".
Annie.
We're sorry, we were worried about your well-being.
I guess we feel like we're sort of all a family.
And Jeff and I are like your Greendale parents.
You're not my mom, Britta.
She would never wear boots that go up that high.
And what about respecting me as an adult and as a friend?
Huh.
You want to be treated as an adult and a friend?
Try not dating your friend's ex-boyfriend.
Find your man.
Oh, my.
Oh, boy.
But you don't like Vaughn.
No, I don't, but I also don't like seeing him with anyone else.
Ta-da!
I asked you if you cared and you said no.
Fine.
I cared.
I'm a girly girl.
I like boys.
I don't like it when they're mean to me.
I don't like it when they stop kissing me and start kissing my friends.
I'm not that cool.
I'm not Juno, okay, homeslice?
This is what it was about for you?
You were jealous?
Oh, please, you can't tell me that you weren't jealous that Vaughn had his hands all over your debatelmake-out partner.
What are you insinuating?
I took that kiss for the team.
What?
Yeah.
That kiss wasn't for pleasure.
It was strategic and joyless.
What?
Yeah.
You did get weirdly specific when you were describing Annie's body.
More specific than the stuff you told me about Britta?
What?
Does anyone get specific about me?
Check your e-mail.
I marked you as spam.
Who the hell is Pam?
When you guys first came in, we were as wholesome and healthy as the family in Brady Bunch.
And now we're as dysfunctional and incestuous as the cast of The Brady Bunch.
I agree with Abed, this is getting creepy.
No more creepy than when Jeff wears tight jeans and you say, "I'd like to slap those buns on the grill".
What?
First, I don't talk like that.
Second of all, where I'm from, it's perfectly normal for women to talk about their male friends' backsides.
You don't see me saying anything crazy about, uh, Abed and Troy's weird, little relationship.
They're just jealous.
All right.
All right, maybe we're not a family.
Maybe it's more complicated.
Because unlike a real family, there's nothing to stop any one of us from looking at any of the others as a sexual prospect.
Why are we even talking about this?
Because you started having sex with Britta's ex-boyfriend.
What?
We haven't even kissed.
That doesn't mean you're not having sex.
Vaughn told me he would take things as slowly as I wanted.
He likes me for who I am and I like him.
You guys hear that?
Annie.
Vaughn.
Britta.
Hi.
Old man river.
Eat me.
Did you get my messages?
No.
I threw my phone into the river.
I thought that, "You know, if I can't be with her, who am I gonna call"?
And then I thought, you know, well, my landlord and my sister and you.
Anyway, I've been doing a lot of soul searching, and this is something I really need to say.
# I see you when you smile And I want to sing a song # # But then I write the words And they always come out wrong # # They come out wrong # # I feel it in my fingers I feel it in my toes # # But then the words get frozen In my mouth like Eskimos # # I like your nose # # Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh # # Annie Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh # # Annie's song ## His songs are dumber than he is.
Yeah, but they're honest.
I'll be right here.
Vaughn wants to show me a cloud that looks like a pumpkin.
Heh.
If that's okay.
Annie, it's more than okay.
Please date Vaughn.
Or anyone else outside this creepy circle.
I wouldn't hang out with you guys if you were creepy.
Trust me, I have good taste.
Oh, you smell like boysenberries.
So just to be clear, I don't have a shot with any of you?
Ugh.
Oh, my God.
I'm dizzy.
I am Kickpuncher.
My cyber punches have the power of kicks.
Mm, mm.
I am Punchkicker, meet your match.
I love you, Kickpuncher.
The only thing beyond the reach of my fists is humanity.
Mm-mm.
You sure Britta couldn't do your part?
Yeah, I asked her, she wasn't available.
Let's go film the sex scene.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
It's Valentine's week, when the Greendale Human Being is the Cupid Being, delivering your gift to that special someone.
But remember, Cupid's face is magic marker on nylon, so love is not only blind but also dizzy and a little belligerent.
I'm chaperoning tomorrow's dance.
You should come.
Maybe your study buds will go.
What's the blonde's name?
Bitter, Butter, Beetlejuice?
Britta.
Yeah, she says Valentine's Day ritualizes a connection between affection and candy so girls can learn the ropes of prostitution.
Translation, no date.
I'm gonna join you at that dance.
But as a novice boyfriend, could I get a map of the minefield known as women's Valentine expectations?
Every day of the year, I want you to do what makes you happy.
Tomorrow, I'm gonna be happy spending the night with an insatiable statistics professor.
Jeff, it's the Registrar's Office.
Seems you were wrong about paying tuition with airline miles.
We're gonna need a check Message deleted.
Jeff Winger, I am calling you.
Oh, yeah.
You're probably, whatever.
So, what's up?
Heh.
Oh, it's the Cupid Being.
Ooh!
Now it has arrows.
That's safe.
Oh!
It's from that cook with the long beard in the cafeteria.
I guess when he said, "I'm gonna get you", um, he meant chocolates.
Aww.
A flower from Vaughn.
He's away on a vision quest.
You got something, Abed?
Another muffin basket from another actress who wants to be in my next film.
Does that work?
Yep.
Meryl Streep has two Oscars because of her baking.
Oh, that's sarcasm but I forgot to inflect.
This sounds way more like sarcasm.
Inflection is so interesting.
That big bag at the bottom.
Is that for me?
Anything in there for Troy?
Troy Barnes.
Barnes, comma, Troy?
Who cares about getting things?
It destroys the true meaning of Valentine's Day.
The birth of St. Valentine's.
Oh, good.
Now it has arrows.
That's safe.
Sorry I'm late.
It's okay.
Actually, you look very early.
Oh, God, I'm really late.
Yes, you are.
Yeah.
See you later.
That's all right.
We'll see you guys.
Can I get you something?
Water?
Smelling salts?
An alibi for Cobain's suicide?
No, but you could help yourself to a shorter forehead, a non-Keebler nose, and shutting up.
Hmm.
That stings.
I mean, not the words.
The clouds of bourbon vapor forming them.
Heh.
A girlfriend from my anarchist days was in town and we drank.
Everything.
Yeah.
And then you said, "I should call Jeff".
Yeah, because the first thing I do when I'm having fun is think about Jeff Winger, I am calling you.
You're probably, whatever.
So, what's up?
The drunk dial.
So much subtext.
So much intrigue.
So much of what the kids are calling BCI.
That's, uh, Booty Call Implication.
Oh What happened to Britta?
Justice.
Having spent the year denying her attraction to me just to be alternative, Britta called me at 3 a.m. just to ask, "What's up"?
A drunk dial?
Was it BCI?
Booty call with a capital B. Mm.
This can't be good.
It's no biggie.
We give each other crap all the time.
Well, that's the point.
What crap can she give now that you hold the cards?
You shifted the balance like in a sitcom when one character sees another one naked.
Is that really a sitcom staple?
No.
I have no idea what I'm talking about.
I'm Abed, I never watch TV.
Now, we all know that in English, the rooster says "cock-a-doodle-doo".
In español, the gallo says: What?
I'm teaching.
Aha!
I knew you were holding back.
Oh!
It's from the girl I'm dating.
Yeah, I met her in Biology.
She was looking for Geology and misread the sign.
Yeah, I said, "We do not study countries in here".
Heh.
Yeah, she's She's dumb, but But sweet.
Yeah, mine's from Danielle.
She's, uh Uh A lovely lady in my Marketing class.
We're sleeping together.
They sound like very lucky ladies.
Yeah, they're not made up.
Beep-beep!
Oh, my God, what's going on?
Beep-beep-beep!
My bull crap meter's going crazy.
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep!
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep!
It's these presents you've obviously sent yourselves to make it look like you have girlfriends.
That's ridiculous.
This is obviously your handwriting, Mr. Tremor.
And yours is signed, "Love, Troy"?
I tell you, this is the most pathetic thing I've ever seen in the classroom.
Oh, my God.
Look at him over there, cutting the gristle off his steak as ruthlessly as he cut off Troy and Pierce's dignity.
Ew!
Now he's eating the gristle.
I'm so sick of Chang.
Always tearing people down, making them feel horrible about themselves.
Somebody needs to humiliate him the way he humiliated our boys.
Mustache, get me a juice box.
Now.
And that somebody is us.
You can vomit onto this food because it already smells like it.
Heh-heh.
Yeah, totally.
Heh-heh-heh.
My law firm went on a retreat to Disney World once, and I got so drunk that I got into a fight with animatronic Ben Franklin.
Why are you telling me this?
Well, the point is that when I'm sober, I don't secretly hate Ben Franklin or even think about him, so you drunk dialing me?
It's not like a big deal.
My God.
You're pitying me now.
Well, you're acting really weird.
I'll talk to you in class, okay?
Just leave me alone till then.
Beep-beep-beep!
What is going on here?
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep!
My doody meter's going crazy.
Okay, cut, cut, cut.
Leo, I'm not feeling it.
I really need to believe that you're holding an imaginary doody meter.
The problem is not me.
It's you and your stupid script.
Idiot.
That's the anger.
Use it.
Wow.
One Papa John's commercial and he thinks he's Christian Bale.
Look, uh, you were right.
Britta is totally weird around me.
It does feel like I saw her naked.
It's a resonant premise.
Tony even saw Angela naked on the opening credits of Who's the Boss?
And did Tony do something to fix that?
I don't know.
I could never get past the opening credits.
But when Chandler saw Rachel naked on Friends, to even the score Rachel needed to see Chandler's penis.
All right.
I'll show Britta my penis.
Jeff, please don't waste my time.
I lose my Chang to Cub Scouts in 20 minutes.
So So, what?
To even the score, I have to drunk dial her?
Isn't that absurdly simplistic?
Would it even work?
Maybe.
Oh.
No room for error.
She'd have to believe it was real.
Have you ever acted drunk before?
I can totally do it.
I'm fine.
I can drive.
I can totally drive right now.
Give me my keys.
That's enough.
No, hold on a second.
All right.
I don't care.
No, seriously, give me my keys.
Okay, that's a wrap, people.
I want you to be at my place at 4 so we can work on this.
Well, no, I can't do that.
Here's why.
Dumbest idea ever.
You know Britta's defining weakness.
She cuts and runs.
Do this half-assed and fail, she may leave, then we all lose her.
That's not gonna happen.
Not on my watch.
That's a deal breaker.
Saddle up.
Sorry I lost my cool.
Just quit smoking.
Kid's gonna be a star.
He's a young "the Asian guy from Lost".
Try it again.
Come on.
You're a big guy.
Action.
Boop-boop-boop-boop-boop.
Hey, Britta.
Your call got me thinking, and thinking got me drinking.
Stop.
That was terrible.
What?
Mm-mm.
You know, I can get drunk alone if that's what helps people act.
Well, that's your problem, Jeff.
You've been acting your whole life.
Okay?
Time to pass that act up and find the actor playing you.
Oh, they are gonna love you in California.
Do you like Britta?
Sure, who doesn't?
Over half the people that meet her.
They can be put off by her vacuous mannequin face, and her Jodie Foster severity.
But you're different.
Uh You know.
She's no barrel of monkeys.
She She wants everyone to be honest but she lies to herself.
She's seen the world but doesn't get it.
She has more fights about stuff that doesn't matter than a YouTube comment section.
She's passionate, which I find stupid but entertaining.
Attractive?
It was only attraction at first because she bothered to play hard to get.
I'm happy with Michelle.
Slater is low maintenance.
Mm.
The lowest.
Britta, irritating, impossible, unpredictable.
She didn't like you.
So it felt useless to like her.
Slater likes you how you are, expects nothing from you.
You're safe from change.
And passion.
Watch it.
Watch what?
A phony drunk-dial soaked in phony pity that insults Britta even more?
Or a believable performance informed by feeling?
You know, I am sure you're a good director, but you are a horrible drinking buddy.
I mean, I can't feel things with you studying me like a beige praying mantis.
You're right.
I thought you never drank.
Scorsese drank with De Niro.
It's not for me.
It's for the audience.
All right, class, turn to page Whoa.
Looks like the law firm of Seacrest and Slumdog is taking the day off.
Ooh.
Another special delivery from Troy and Pierce's imaginary lovers?
Wait a minute.
Uhn.
That one's for me.
Heh-heh-heh.
All right.
Oh, yeah.
Huh.
Chh-chh.
Wow.
It's from Princeton.
They want to make me associate professor of the Spanish Department?
They're telling me I can name my price?
Oh, my God.
At Princeton?
Come on.
You two idiots really thought I'd fall for this, huh?
This is your pathetic attempt to punish me for humiliating you.
But we didn't do it.
Save it.
As punishment, because you two obviously don't have any girlfriends, escort me to the Valentine's Dance wearing elegant ladies' pantsuits.
Ha-ha-ha.
Yeah, right.
You'll do it or you fail my class.
You can't do that.
Have you met me?
I mean it.
Tonight, you are my bitches.
Holy crap.
Abed.
Abed?
It's 3:00.
What happened?
The last thing I remember is you were dancing like that girl in the movie Kids In Detention?
Breakfast Club?
Dear God.
What have you done to me?
Wait, did I call Britta?
Where's my phone?
Got it.
You made two outgoing calls.
One to Britta, one to your girlfriend.
I don't remember either of them.
Neither do I. And I don't remember the name of the girl in The Breakfast Club.
Mary.
Margaret.
Molly Ringworm?
You broke me.
I still can't believe I'm a size 14.
I know the 12 was a little tight but I could have pulled it off.
You guys really going through with this?
We have to.
He'll fail us.
But we're gonna find out who wrote that letter.
We have leads.
Yeah.
It was written on fake Princeton letterhead.
So whoever wrote it, worked at Princeton, ran out of stationary, and didn't have time to go to the store.
Um, you guys?
Mm-mm!
Mm.
What?
Women's sizes run slimmer.
I'm sure you're a 12 everywhere that it counts.
Well, I'll take every little victory I can get right now.
Thanks.
Hmm.
You look about ready to marry Courtney Love.
That's the reverse of my zinger from before.
Okay, please stop shouting, all right?
I feel like that person in the TV show.
Do you remember calling me last night?
Yeah.
Why?
Are we cool?
Oh, yeah.
Have a seat, Drunky Brewster.
Let's study.
Hey, balance restored, I guess.
Movie reference.
Hey there.
Happy Valentine's Day.
I've been calling you.
Yeah, I know.
I figured I'd just let it go to voicemail in case you had the wrong number again.
Elaborate?
Oh, you don't remember calling me at 4 in the morning and hanging up when you realized I wasn't Britta?
I guess not.
Michelle.
Michelle, um, I was trying to call Britain to order you toffees.
Now that might sound dumb, but I needed to open with it to make the truth less ridiculous.
Two nights ago, Britta drunk-dialed me, and it embarrassed her and made her sad, and the only way for her to get her power back was for me to get believably drunk and leave her an equally embarrassing message.
It sure seems like you and Britta are friends the way my mom's pool cleaner was my uncle.
Have you had sex with her?
Not even a little.
What doesn't make sense is that you did all this work to put a smile on her face but can't pick up ice cream for Law and Order night because it feels too marriage-y.
First of all, Chubby Hubby?
I mean, could you pick a scarier flavor?
Let's talk about this later.
I need to chaperone something.
There he is.
Oh.
You know, I thought I'd be embarrassed.
Now I'm just scared.
I am seriously reconsidering how much I want this language credit.
Remember what we said?
Never let him see us cry.
Right.
Okay, one, two Wait.
Keep your coats on.
We're the ones that sent the letter to Chang.
What?
You work You work at Princeton?
We were mad at him for humiliating you.
Well, nice fix, Tweedledum and even Tweedlerdum.
Look, we're gonna tell Chang the truth, and we'll pay the price.
Wait.
We can't make you do that.
No, he's right.
First we gotta get out of these pantsuits then you can put them on.
Look, Pierce, this whole thing started because you and I were ashamed we didn't have ladies that cared about us.
And the good news is we obviously do.
The bad news is that it makes it our manly duty to protect them tonight.
Oh!
That's nice but we really can't let you do that.
No, he's right.
He's right.
Step aside.
Oh.
Let's handle this like men.
Yeah.
Whoo.
Ladies.
They're going to be okay, right?
Get in my Mercedes.
Just look away, baby.
Just look away.
Whoa.
Looking for someone?
Yeah.
Slater.
Heh.
Very funny.
You know, when you called me last night and invited me to the dance, I was shocked.
And thrilled.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
No.
No.
Look, I'm sorry.
Uh, I don't I don't remember asking you to the dance.
I don't remember anything.
And now Slater knows about all the drunk-dialing stuff, and I'm in the doghouse.
And if she finds out about this, it's over.
So, again, I am sorry.
I am so, so sorry.
And you are messing with me right now, aren't you?
I knew you didn't remember anything from that phone call last night.
You got dressed up just to see me sweat?
Oh, believe me.
You're worth it.
Sorry.
Just chaperoning.
Enjoy the dance.
Wait, Michelle.
Jeff, what's left to say?
Uh l I don't know.
I I do.
He said it last night.
So look, I am really into Michelle.
And I don't wanna screw it up.
She's a perfect girlfriend.
And I want you to be as happy as me because you're, like, my favorite friend, so Ha-ha-ha.
I'm sorry.
Abed just made a turtle face.
In his defense, Abed's turtle face is really funny.
Thanks, Britta.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah.
That was the first 20 seconds of a 40-minute message.
Very informative.
Happy Valentine's Day, perfect boyfriend.
Yeah, that's me.
Man, I cannot wait to get out of these ridiculous outfits.
Woof!
I know, yeah.
What are you doing?
I'm parked over here.
Oh, uh, well Uh Heh-heh.
Come on.
Um What the hell is this?
We're going to get frozen yogurt.
Aah.
I'm not gay, man.
They close in seven minutes.
I could have driven you.
You said he hated fro-yo.
Just drive.
Slut!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Good morning, everybody.
Hi, Jeff.
I brought bagels.
Oh, I'd love a bagel.
The perfect beginning for my first day of billiards class.
Oh.
Did you pick a special outfit so you could look sexy shooting pool?
Shirley, I have no idea what you are talking about.
Oh.
Oh.
Thirteen.
Oh, great, so much for "baggles".
So much for what?
The "baggles".
You dropped them on the floor.
Uh, they're called "bay-gels".
Uh, I lived in New York, Troy.
I know what a "baggle" is.
What the hell is wrong with you?
What?
You say "bagel" wrong.
I say it the same as you.
Say it again.
"Baggle".
Can we just keep studying?
We're on page 258.
What "padge" was that?
Two-five-tee-eight.
Heh.
Whoa.
Check this out.
Uh-oh.
Oh, it's a drawing of Abed with hearts all around it.
Strictly speaking, Troy, the Bible condemns this level of friendship.
I didn't draw that.
I bought that used.
Must have been whoever had it last.
Obviously, it's a girl who has a crush on Abed.
This is so romantic.
It's just like The Notebook, except instead of Alzheimer's, Abed has Ahem.
Mm-hm.
Someone who likes him.
Well, whoever she is, she's fat.
These thick pencil lines were drawn with a heavy hand.
We gotta find this person for Abed.
Unless it's a boy, then we find him for Jesus.
But either way, this is going to be fun.
Cute little face.
THEN CLASS REPEATING.
] THEN CLASS REPEATING.
] Guys, class is over.
I'm trying to get you to leave.
Oh.
Let's go.
Pick that up.
Señor Chang?
We're trying to figure out whose Spanish book this was before Troy's.
Jenny Adams.
Oh.
Oh, come on.
If all Chinese were psychic you would have started using birth control centuries ago.
Her name's in the front of the book, morons.
Yay.
He's right.
Them I understand.
But how did you not think of that?
I may have been thrown off by Britta's pronunciation of the word "bagel".
How do you pronounce bagel?
I don't.
Come on.
Ugh.
"Baggle".
You're the worst.
So we have a name.
Jenny Adams.
Cool.
See, it's a fat girl's name.
Might as well be Gravy Jones.
Pierce, it doesn't matter what she looks like.
This will be great for Abed.
It will?
Aren't you excited about talking to her?
I wasn't planning on it.
What?
Guys, come on, you heard Abed.
He's not interested.
Drop it.
Jeff, you need to mind your own business.
Abed, you need to get with this girl, immediately, if not sooner.
Yeah?
Abed, for guys like you, this kind of opportunity only comes around once in a life While.
It's important to date in college, Abed.
It's a time of freedom and exploration.
A time when a simple pillow fight between two innocent girls could turn to a steamy night of unbridled lust.
Britta knows all about it.
Okay.
Cool.
So you guys are gonna Can't Buy Me Love me, right?
We're gonna what you?
You're gonna Can't Buy Me Love me.
You know, transform me from zero to hero, geek to chic.
Oh, he wants us to Love Don't Cost a Thing him.
Oh.
Can't Buy Me Love was the remake for white audiences.
That's so uncomfortable when they do that.
I can't believe it doesn't insult them.
All right, nobody here is Can't Buy Me Love-ing or Love Don't Cost a Thing-ing anyone.
Because we've all seen enough after-school specials and Fat Albert to know Oh.
That Abed only needs to be himself.
Sure glad there are no old people here.
This conversation would probably be total gibberish to them.
Jeff's unprecedentedly right about this.
Abed, when we find this girl, you're gonna approach her just the way you are.
Because that's good enough.
Yeah.
Then you can take her to a nice deli and treat her to a "baggle".
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, nice shooting.
Good clean strokes.
Thanks.
Form a line, please.
My name is Coach Bogner.
Welcome to the Art of Pool, which is a phys ed class.
Which means that you all have to wear the proper equipment at all times.
So suit up.
See you back on the felt in 5.
Heh.
You're gonna look like an ass in those.
Shut up, Leonard.
I talked to your son on Family Day.
I know all about your gambling.
Touché.
All right, everybody just hang out and be casual.
My sources tell me that Jenny Adams is the blonde who's reading right over there.
Whoa!
That's her?
She's pretty.
Which is not a surprise at all, Abed.
Okay, Abed, we're gonna be here for moral support.
Just go over there, do your thing.
Okay.
Remember, be yourself.
Got it.
Cool.
Great.
Abed.
Yeah?
What are you doing?
I'm being myself.
Go be yourself by Jenny.
But I wouldn't go over there.
How do you know that?
A lifetime of observation mostly.
Well, do you think there's a version of yourself that might go over there?
Absolutely.
Could you be him?
Okay.
Oh.
What the hell was that?
A different version of me.
I think he was a vampire.
All right.
If this is gonna turn ugly, I can't be here.
I'm a two-striker.
No, Pierce, please, hang on.
Abed, will you excuse us, please?
Yeah.
Look, I know that we're all good people.
And good people believe that people should be themselves.
But if Abed is himself, he's gonna die alone.
And if we let him be someone else Be right back.
I'm out of here.
Oh, my God, there's a midget on stilts.
You're not in uniform.
Yeah, about that.
We seriously have to wear shorts to play pool?
If you play in this class.
It's regulation.
Regulation pool or regulation you?
Do you have something against playing pool with a full range of motion and optimal comfort?
I'm comfortable in my own clothes.
I bet you are.
I'm sorry?
I said I bet you're comfortable dressed like a model instead of an athlete, sipping martinis, smoking, instead of keeping your game on the table.
Hey, listen, man, you're implying I'm some sort of pool poser because I don't wanna wear a bathing suit.
You're the weird one.
That's weird, not me.
Nobody plays pool like that.
Yeah, what do you call this?
I call that your personal business, okay?
And I call this class the desecration of America's coolest sport.
Yeah.
l See, right there.
Ha.
"Coolest sport".
Okay, I want everybody to know what's going on here.
This hipster is dropping this class because he cares more about what he looks like than how he's playing.
Oh, please.
You're the one with the rules about clothes.
And, by the way, I could kick your ass all over that table.
Oh, is that a challenge?
Huh?
Because if you play me in pool, you play me in shorts.
And if you can't do that, well, my point's already made.
I don't have anything to prove to you or Look, you're stupid.
This is stupid.
Pool in shorts is stupid.
Vanity, thy name is his name.
Bye.
It's the first day.
I didn't catch it.
Okay, Abed, we know that, normally, you wouldn't approach a girl.
But if you don't learn how, you won't get Jenny.
Yeah and you got two days.
Then I'm going after her.
Pierce.
What, I'm incentivizing him.
Also, if she's into Abed, let's face it, anybody could hit that.
I understand, I need to change who I am to someone more likeable.
No, no, sweetie, it's not about changing.
It's about learning.
Learning to change?
No, it's Good grief, clear the chickens off the runway.
I'll be the bad guy.
Yes, Abed, you need to be someone else.
Someone who, eventually, gets a girlfriend.
Because I can't think of anything more frightening than a half-Polish, half-Arab virgin in his 30s.
One way or the other, that story ends with an explosion.
Let's try a practice run.
All right, Annie, you sit here, okay, and be a girl.
Abed, you take a run at her.
Let's see what you got.
Okay.
Hmm.
What are you reading?
Pride and Prejudice.
So you're familiar with two sins.
How about a third?
Oh.
I don't think we're allowed to smoke in here.
Then you picked the wrong outfit, didn't you?
Abed, what are you doing?
Don Draper from Mad Men.
What'd you think?
Awesome.
Put your tongue in her ear.
I liked it.
Don't be him.
He cheats on his wife.
Be somebody nice like Mike Brady.
He always had that housekeeper throwing herself at him.
He never made a move on her.
Don't be Mike Brady.
Mike Brady's not sexy.
You should be like Jo from Facts of Life.
But you know, the dude version.
I knew it.
You should be like Calvin.
His best friend was a tiger, he always went on dope adventures.
Anything stood in his way, he just peed on it.
Calvin Coolidge?
No, you guys.
Don Draper was clearly the sexiest And the worst thing about it, is like that Calvin.
What are you guys doing?
They're teaching me to be someone else.
Oh, for God's sake.
What did I tell you guys?
Oh, for God's sakes, everybody, do whatever you want.
Leave each other alone.
Whoa, that's a good Jeff.
How'd you do that?
Ten percent Dick Van Dyke, 20 percent Sam Malone, 40 percent Zach Braff in Scrubs, and 30 percent Hilary Swank in Boys Don't Cry.
Zach Braff?
Sorry.
Abed, what if you just did Jeff for Jenny?
Uh And your point is?
Look, I don't want any part of this.
And I can't believe tha That you're still doing it after I already explained the obvious lesson smacking you in the face.
Hey, why aren't you in billiards class?
Because I don't look cool in shorts.
Oh!
Whoa!
Okay.
Because I'm not cool in shorts.
Now that's good.
That was really good.
I don't wanna spoil the ending but, uh, pride ends up with prejudice.
That's funny.
I know.
Stick with me, and you get a laugh or two.
That's the Abed guarantee.
I feel like I've seen you before.
It's working.
I know.
I get that a lot from art students.
I'm told I have a face made for sketching.
I'd rather think it was made for kissing.
How about for punching, huh?
What are you doing hitting on my girlfriend, ugly?
This is awkward.
Oh, my God.
It's a white Abed.
I I know.
It It's like Abed but employable.
Huh, boss?
Let's go, Slumdog.
Oh.
And one last Lost and Found announcement.
Jeff Winger, I've been informed by Coach Bogner that you left your panties in his pool class so better pick those up.
When is he gonna stop doing that?
Do you know that he called me a hipster?
Hipster.
Do hipsters walk around wearing $300 jeans from Italy?
Can we please talk about Abed?
Thanks to us, his heart's been broken.
Well, I hate to say that I told you so, so I'll shout it through cupped hands.
I told you so.
We were only trying to help.
Oh, come on, who are we kidding?
Jeff's right.
Abed was happy being Abed till we had to sully his mind with thoughts of love and romance and vaginas.
Those are the big three.
That's what they call them.
Poor Abed.
He was probably too sad to get out of bed this morning.
Hi.
Abed.
About yesterday Oh, yeah.
You guys must be pretty upset.
Why would we be upset?
Well, I know how important it was for you that I get a girlfriend.
So when Jenny went off with white Abed, it must have really hurt.
Ah.
It did.
White Abed?
Jenny's boyfriend is a white guy that's almost identical to Abed.
Name is Joey and that's why the sketch was in Troy's book.
So does that make Abed brown Joey?
If you wanna get racist about it.
Abed, you know we just want you to be happy, right?
Yeah, I know.
Everybody wants me to be happy.
Everybody wants to help me.
But usually when they find out they can't, they get frustrated and stop talking to me.
Or they trick me into buying them ice cream and then shove me into a clothes dryer.
Which I didn't wanna happen with you guys so I wanted to make sure you felt you could help.
The truth is, lots of girls like me because, let's face it, I'm pretty adorable.
Mm-hm.
And, uh, my aloofness unconsciously reminds them of their fathers, so I'm more used to them approaching me.
So we didn't damage your self-esteem or anything?
Britta, I got self-esteem falling out of my butt.
That's why I was willing to change for you, because when you really know who you are and what you like about yourself changing for other people isn't such a big deal.
Abed, you're a god.
If you'll all excuse me, I have a man to beat in pool while wearing shorts.
Is that code for going number one or number two?
Abed, you've inspired me too.
People can mock me all they want.
I don't care how I say the word "baggle".
"Baggle".
She said the word "baggle".
Okay, let's play some pool.
Hey, nice cross corner, Leonard.
Totally.
Heh-heh.
I'd like to see Jeff Winger try that shot without the benefit of his stylish clothing.
Oh, would you?
Jeff Winger.
Shouldn't you be at a Urban Outfitters?
I'll go there later if I feel like it.
But first I have to hand someone their tightly polyester-swaddled ass in a game of pool.
Ooh.
Oh, burn.
Now, do you wanna talk about clothes like a girl?
Or use tapered sticks to hit balls around a cushioned table like a man?
Balls, like a man.
Oh!
Rack them.
I'll break.
Why?
Because it looks cool?
I don't know.
You tell me.
Yeah.
Get out of the way.
Shh-shh, boom.
Yeah.
Let me just clean this side of the table off here, all right?
Oh, okay.
There you go.
See that?
There you go.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
What do you think of that?
See, you haven't learned anything.
Except how to look cool playing pool in shorts.
You're wrong, man.
I'm just having a good time because I love playing pool.
Liar.
You think you look cool.
Yeah?
Well, how cool is this?
Stop projecting your obsession with clothes onto me as an excuse for when I beat you in a game of real pool.
Oh, you wanna play real pool, huh?
Oh!
I'll play real pool.
Now who doesn't care how they look?
Me.
Shouldn't you be stopping this?
Soon.
Soon.
Just gathering evidence.
Three-to-one against Winger.
Who's on?
Oh!
Oh!
Ah!
Oh.
Oh You know what, Jeff?
One of us is about to win this game.
But years from now, when the story is retold, all they're gonna remember is one of us loved clothes and the other loved the game.
Ooh.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Oh Ooh.
Oh!
Ooh!
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah.
You look at me.
Look at me.
You beat me.
From now on, you play pool dressed however you choose.
I choose shorts.
I choose shorts.
Shorts.
You son of a bitch.
You magnificent son of a bitch.
Jeff.
That was awesome.
Let me get in here.
Oh!
Okay, you're sweaty.
All right, all right.
Nice game.
Thanks.
Look, l I hope this doesn't sound too forward.
But, um, could you introduce me to your friend?
You know what?
l I know that guy's m.o., and I think it's better if you introduce yourself.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Courtney.
Abed.
Man, why couldn't I be Brown Joey?
Tsk.
Hey, Abed.
Hey Troy.
Here's the book I borrowed.
Thank you.
Did you finally get your own book?
Something like that.
Wait a second.
It's okay.
Let's have cookies.
Okay.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
My cousin's funeral was today.
Oh, was that That was today?
I knew there was some reason I couldn't do this today.
Poor Demitri.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hey.
Haven't seen you all day.
Hah.
I've been really busy.
Plus I had to find 30 extra chairs for my classroom since it's Family Day.
Oh.
Speaking of, I was gonna invite my mom so you could meet her but, uh, she still thinks I'm a lawyer.
Oh, look.
A Human Being has a little Human with it.
How bloodcurdlingly adorable.
Jeff, we need to talk.
What's wrong?
Are you breaking up with me?
Oh.
Heh-heh.
Maybe we don't need to talk.
I'm so excited for everybody to meet my sons.
Hope they're not twins.
Twins freak me out.
They always know what the other one is Yeah.
Thinking?
And finishing each other's Pie.
Exactly.
It's creepy.
It's nice spending time with them.
I don't get to see them that much since I started school.
My sister likes to joke they don't recognize me anymore, and I like to joke she's just jealous because she's barren.
Hmm.
My dad's bringing cousin Abra.
She's visiting from Gaza.
Does she look like you, but in a wig and lipstick?
No, that's Halle Berry.
Abra wears a full burka in public so she just looks like someone covered head to toe in black fabric.
I can't believe my grandma's rolling her old bones down here.
I gotta pick a cabinet to hide in.
You hide from her?
Yeah, she's crazy.
Troy.
Society programs us to dispose of the elderly because they don't work or buy things, but don't be blind to your grandmother's value.
You need to cherish her.
You cherish her.
I'm sure I will.
She's not gonna be around forever.
I wanna believe you're right, Britta, but you never quite are, are you?
Sorry, I'm late.
Was somebody canoodling with a certain professor?
Actually, no.
She dumped me.
Oh, no, that's so sad.
I'll give Jeff a shoulder to cry on.
You boys put a dead bird in that bitch's glove compartment.
Got it.
Guys, guys, sit.
Shirley, I don't need to cry.
I'm fine.
Jeff, we're your friends.
Let it all out.
There's nothing to let out.
I'm just glad I didn't have to do the dumping.
Then I'd have to lay low for three weeks to look sensitive.
To avoid questions of overlap, but as the dumpee, heh, I can start making out with every girl on campus now and all anyone will feel for me is sorry.
Ew.
Not anymore.
Your heart's desensitized, Jeff.
You're like a machine.
It feels no love, just sex.
You're like the Booty-nator.
You know, Booty-nator?
Like "I'll be back," but with booty.
Why would Booty-nator be back with booty?
Wouldn't he just try and kill it?
Well, maybe he kills it, then brings it back as a trophy.
Why would he want dead booty?
I want Pirate's Booty.
Because you're hungry?
Guys.
I'll be back, but with booty.
Yeah.
That's beneath you.
Gross.
Well, you're too gorgeous to be a teacher and you're too happy to be a student.
Take me to where your car broke down.
I'm here for Family Day.
I'm looking for my family.
Oh.
Well, at the very least, I could fill in for a creepy uncle.
Jeff.
Amber.
There she is.
Look at you, all grown up.
Jeff, this is my stepdaughter, Amber.
Small world.
No, actually, it's a very big world with Good luck.
Come on, I'll show you around.
I'm back.
Without booty.
Now I feel sorry for you.
Hands in the air.
Homeland Security.
Boys, leave that man alone.
Orange alert.
Orange alert.
Sorry.
They're just excited.
You're, uh, Abed's father?
I'm Shirley.
And that's Elijah like the prophet and Jordan like the 14-time NBA All-Star.
Gubi Nadir.
Is it how you say hello?
That's my name.
Oh!
I'm sorry, you You're like a black ghost.
This is my cousin, Abra.
Greetings.
Over the course of seven marriages, I amassed some 32 stepchildren and obviously, Amber's my favorite.
Yeah, there was something about his mass e-mails that made me certain this would be a family reunion.
It sure is, sweetie.
She's going to photography school.
Oh, sounds interesting.
Keep it in your pants.
You're embarrassing yourself.
She may be hot, but she's my princess.
Step princess.
Okay.
Family Day.
Let's see what we got here.
Wow.
I can't believe Star-Burns isn't a virgin.
But judging from that Bluetooth headset, his son is.
Ch-chang!
Winger.
Too cool for family?
Everyone here is my family.
Oh Weak.
Cute.
Where's your family, El Tigre?
Ugh.
My older brother will be at the barbecue.
And it's none of your business, but I ate my twin in utero.
Oh.
Hey, Phantom Menace.
How's the trade embargo with the Naboo?
Anyway, oh, looks like Pierce broke the piggy bank at the escort service this time.
Hey, duck sauce.
That was rude.
The call girls I frequent are not nearly as attractive as my daughter.
Stepdaughter.
Technically, ex-stepdaughter.
You know, your mother April Mm-hm.
Wanda, her name's Was it Wanda?
Yes.
Yes.
I need one sec.
Excuse me.
Uh, Jeff, Jeff.
Uh Cards on the table, Jeff.
Amber's the best shot I'll ever have at something like a real daughter and I'm striking out.
Have you told her she's prettier than a hooker?
If you come to the barbecue I know you'd never think of touching her.
Maybe you could say a couple cool things about me.
You want me to wingman you with your ex-stepdaughter?
I'm sorry.
I got a thing.
You have a thing?
Yeah, and it's on the rebound.
I'm not subjecting it to a night with a hot girl that I can't have.
You can't holster it for a friend?
Please, Pierce is barely a friend.
He's no more related to Amber than you are, and was a total jag about shutting me down.
How much effort do I rate?
For you?
Um, I'd break a light sweat.
Good, I need a favor.
Help Pierce with his stepdaughter?
You're becoming dangerous, Annie.
It's those doe eyes.
Disappointing you is like choking the Little Mermaid with a bike chain.
Is this Nana Barnes?
Troy didn't mention you were such a knockout.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh.
Come on.
I'm sure you've broken a few hearts in your time.
Oh.
Tell me.
How many men do you think I've laid with?
Who are you?
I am Britta.
And I have offended you and I am sorry.
Is there anything I can get you?
Yes.
You can get me a switch.
A what now?
She's not family, Nana.
You can't make her get a switch.
She can make me get it.
I just have to know what it is.
A switch is a stick she can use to whoop you with.
Cherish, Britta.
Cherish.
Heh.
Well, it was wonderful meeting your brother.
Adios, Señor Chang, shalom, Rabbi Chang, and to both of you, sayonara.
Don't go.
Señor Chang?
Ben, do you realize how ridiculous that sounds?
Okay, that is who I am.
So drop it.
Dropping.
I'm dropping.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Amber alert.
You are allergic to peanuts.
That might be a different step kid.
My flight actually leaves so Your flight actually leaves after I tell you a story called: Pierce Takes On The School Bully.
Heh.
Are you a ninja Oh, baby.
Don't be rude.
Uh, she's wearing a burka.
It's a way women to express their modesty.
They're like Islamic turtlenecks.
Ask her if she wants to play with us.
Bouncy house.
Sounds heated.
Did she call him a pig's anus or something?
She's saying she's old enough to jump in a giant balloon.
She's saying he's overprotective.
Now she says he's a pig anus.
That fight made me crave a hot dog.
Stay put, boys.
I'll be right back.
Look at them.
You are a bad mother.
Control your children.
I have to go back to my car and get my emergency shirt.
And I don't even like that shirt.
Not only did he join a band, they got jealous and booted him.
Get out.
Heh-heh.
That's exactly what they said.
Off to the bathroom, Stepdad.
I've never been called Stepdad.
I don't think anyone has.
Listen, when she gets back, come up with some reason why you have to leave, okay?
I'll beg you to stay, but you don't.
In fact, why don't you just leave now.
Cut our work in half.
Good luck, buddy.
You're leaving?
My girlfriend is pregnant.
Pierce said you were gay.
He Yup.
As the sunrise.
And I'm deeply ashamed.
I'm just glad I have friends like Pierce to keep me Honest.
This is slightly wrong.
Too much tongue?
Just enough.
But it It's Pierce.
You mean the guy who decided he doesn't want men touching his ex-stepdaughter, but divorced Mom for our housekeeper?
Could be the same guy, yeah.
Amber?
Amber, there you are.
Why are you here, Jeff?
I go to school here, remember?
Ahem.
There's a Pictionary tournament in the student lounge.
Sounds fun.
Is Jeff joining us?
I don't know if he can, can you?
I can't.
Oh.
Come on, stay.
Stay.
I can't.
Maybe I shouldn't, either.
Stay, Jeff.
You think I should?
I think you have to.
I'll stay.
Me too.
Ha-ha.
Good Family Day.
What are you doing?
Getting Nana a switch.
Britta, stop pretending that my mean old nana is awesome.
I'm not pretending.
I think it's cool that she's got her own style of discipline.
Nana's old school.
Yeah, my mom told me there'd be white people that did this.
With the pocket watches and coffee grinders, and pretending to be into steamboats.
But let's get this straight.
This is real life.
My Nana is gonna whoop you.
Not unless I find her a switch.
How about this?
Yeah, that's a great switch, Britta.
Very hip.
Should hurt a lot.
Uh, where's Elijah and Jordan?
Uh, Abed?
Oh, what a surprise that you lost them.
They're playing hide and seek.
Uh, where?
I don't think that's how it works.
Stop screwing around, Abed.
Hey, you want to yell at someone?
Go find your crazy kids.
My boy is disciplined.
It's not his job All right, you got me, Gubi.
I'm a bad mother.
I let my kids be kids instead of acting like a jail warden.
Ah.
You don't like her burka?
I'm not talking about the burka.
I'm talking about her never having any fun.
Now Abra, you look me in the eyes and you tell me Um I'm sorry.
I seemed to have forgotten the napkins.
Do Do you mind?
Fine.
Now I'm the napkin man.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Circle.
Circle with a squiggly line.
Uh Squiggly line circle.
You You did hear me say circle.
Smiling sideways vagina.
No.
Happy sideways vagina.
No.
Happy face.
And that's a clam?
As happy as a clam.
Yes.
As happy as a clam?
What a gay guess.
Idiot.
Pierce, you're up.
Eat my dust, Winger.
You do know we're on the same team?
Go.
Uh All right, here we go.
Uh Let's see.
Look, I don't, uh Pierce you have to add more.
Draw more.
Stop.
Stop circling the same thing.
Well, guess something, you girlfriendless geek.
What are you drawing?
You're supposed to know, stupid.
Relax.
I'll get this.
I think they'll both drop charges, but we gotta take statements.
It's gonna be a while.
And I may just be a simple cop, but people need to know.
This isn't gonna stop until Pictionary bans the word windmill.
Pierce, we'll meet you at the gala.
We're gonna go get you some coffee.
Is coffee code for sex?
Is it?
No.
Nana, here's your switch.
Bring it here.
I'll make do.
Okay.
Let me have it.
I ain't no nun.
Bend over.
Drop your pants and get over my lap.
All you have to do is walk away.
What are you doing?
She's respecting her elders.
See Troy?
Did you think I was a hypocrite?
That I wouldn't really Okay, that really Oh!
Okay, that really I don't understand you, Britta.
I don't understand you at all.
You know what?
Totally wrong room.
Will you get the door?
Uh She's had enough.
Oh She's had enough.
Let's focus on you, the forbidden fruit that is the ex-stepdaughter of a casual acquaintance.
Oh, oops.
Don't wanna lose that.
Why do you have a $25,000 check from Pierce?
Tuition for fashion school.
Not photography school?
You caught me.
Uh Maybe I'll just buy a car.
And you can just do that, huh?
Well, it helps that he's kind of desperate and stupid.
Did you wanna be a good person right now or did you wanna be with me?
Oh, there you are.
Thanks a lot, Pollyanna.
You made me hang out with Pierce and his stepdaughter.
She's grifting him.
She's what?
She's taking a bunch of money from him.
He thinks it's for school, but it's for grifting.
Did you tell him?
It's not that simple.
It's not?
Oh, my Jeff.
Gross.
You're gross.
You did it with her?
Yeah, but not twice.
I wanted to do it twice.
That's gross.
You met her this morning.
You're faster than some bacteria.
Are you just doing this because Slater hurt you?
What?
No, I'm not hurt.
And Amber threw herself at me.
Well, you still have to tell Pierce that she's taking advantage of him, don't you?
Well, when you think about it, nobody's getting hurt.
Pierce is getting a daughter, Amber's getting an allowance, I'm getting We already talked about it.
But don't forget this is Pierce.
He's a racist, homophobic old goof.
He does bad stuff all the time.
Well, it sounds like you've got it all figured out, so why are you talking to me about it?
Because you're You know.
A decent person?
Maybe.
And you knew talking to me about it would make you feel like a bad friend.
You wanted to feel like a bad friend because you wanna be a good friend?
You really suck, you know that?
Mm, mm, mm!
Go get you and your brother some Ding Dongs and calm down.
Okay.
What's up?
Oh.
Abed, did your family take off?
Yeah.
Thanks for distracting my dad while we helped Abra get back in her burka.
Well, if a young lady wants to go in a bouncy house, she should go.
It was a noble thing you did.
Oh, I didn't do it.
No, it was Jordan and Elijah's idea.
They're good kids.
If they weren't, they wouldn't help Abra.
I see why you were so excited for me to meet them.
You should be proud of them.
You're a good mom.
Oh.
Come on.
Hey, Mom.
Look what I got.
Ding Dongs, my favorite.
Mm.
Ha-ha.
Pretty rough, huh?
Mm.
You were right.
Nana is a monster.
What did you say?
I said you were a monster, ma'am.
And you said Troy was right.
Get me a switch.
Okay.
Hey, stranger.
Wanna pick up where we left off after I log some time with Daddy Warbucks?
No, Amber.
Uh I thought about it and what I want is for you to tear up that check and go dance with your stepdad.
Are you trying to get me to cut you in?
You don't have leverage.
If I walk over there and tell him everything, guess who he'll forgive.
You, but I'd rather be the bad guy than watch you siphon him.
How about this?
I walk away and if the check clears, I won't make problems for you.
I'll stay gone.
Come back whenever you want, but be good to him when you do because I'll be around.
I'm his friend.
And you can be his stepdaughter, or not.
Yeah.
I'll take the 25 grand.
Over him, I'd take 25 cents.
Bye.
Oh, Jeff.
Heh.
Have you seen Amber?
Yeah.
Listen, Pierce.
Uh I gotta tell you something.
She's not coming, is she?
I wrote her a pretty big check this afternoon.
I had a feeling she might take it and run.
You want me to help you cancel it?
Oh, hell, she earned it.
You're lucky, Jeff.
It's not too late for you.
Have a family.
Share your life.
That and understanding computers are two things you just can't knock out at the end.
Pierce, who did you call last week after you farted on Vaughn?
Ha-ha.
You.
And who did Abed call after that squirrel stole his hotdog?
Me.
That's sharing your life.
If you have friends, you have family.
Jeffrey.
Come here, son.
Are we hugging or dancing?
You know, if the roles were reversed, I would have had sex with your ex-stepdaughter.
I did.
Chip off the old block.
It was either that or deal with your actual pain.
What pain?
Twelve o'clock.
Oh, are you kidding me?
l It's okay, it's okay.
Let it out.
We always used to watch the shows she wanted to watch.
I hate Glee.
I'm not crazy about Glee, either.
I hate it.
I don't understand the appeal at all.
Why did we do this again?
We thought it looked fun.
Is your cell phone in your pocket?
Yeah, but I can't reach it.
I can only move my right arm.
Okay.
There's money already in there.
Slide your arm through that bottom slot and press the button G-14.
When a snack is selected, the mechanical lever that's holding it will be thrust forward, thereby knocking your cell phone out of your pocket and into the receptacle below.
We could pick it up and call for help.
Here we go.
Troy?
I think I hit G-13.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
I had to get up so early for my bus I caught what Cinemax gets up to at night.
Subscription cancelled.
I got that channel for Eddie Murphy movies, not stimulation.
Why are you taking the bus?
What happened to your minivan?
My ex-husband needed it.
The person he's dating works at a club an hour from the city.
Oh.
Well, I'll play a violin for them and maybe she can strip to it.
Kind people are always kind, Britta.
Not just when it's easy.
As we stand, once again upon the deadline to drop or add classes, I hereby present this semester's Jeff Winger pick for ultimate blow-off class: Beginner Pottery.
Your last "blow off" class ended up teaching me to live in the moment.
Which I will always regret and never do again.
This one's different.
I researched.
You don't have to make a good pot.
You get an art credit for participation.
This class is like a redhead that drinks Scotch and loves Die Hard.
I suggest you all get her number.
Ahoy.
Guess which class I signed up for.
Singing with Tennille?
Sailing.
The nearest body of water is two and a half hours away.
Leagues, Abed.
We don't measure water by hours.
It's a one-week intensive that gives you hands-on experience on a real boat right here in the parking lot.
I'd rather learn boats than pots.
I was gonna take a class on how to put together an online dating profile.
But I think sailing in the parking lot is less pathetic.
A black person on a sail boat?
I gotta see this.
I'm in.
How about you, Abed?
You wanna sail with us?
There's black people.
Mm-hm.
Two.
All right.
Hello, ladies.
What you guys making, big balls here?
Oh, yeah.
You guys getting dirty?
Nice.
What are you looking at?
Heh, heh.
All right.
Hey, Laura Ingalls.
Home Depot guy.
Who's making pots, huh?
Let's participate this thing.
Let's do this.
Ladies, I don't know why you're laughing.
I do wanna make my mom an ashtray.
Okay.
Hello, my precious blueberries.
Hello.
Hi.
All right, let's spin those wheels and play with some clay.
Now, there's one and only one rule in this class.
I will tolerate no reenacting, whether it's ironic or sincere, of the Patrick Swayze-Demi Moore pottery scene in Ghost.
Ever since that movie was released in 1990, I have seen every conceivable variation of what I call ghosting.
This can be guy-on-girl, girl-on-guy.
The hilarious guy-on-guy.
So since it never stopped, I had to adopt a zero-Ghost- tolerance policy.
If you so much as hum three notes from that Righteous Brothers song with God as my witness, I will come at you with everything I've got, okay?
Let's have a great time.
I'm making falafel.
Mm.
Not edible.
What are you making?
A vase.
Hey, guys.
Yep?
Look what I made.
A participant badge.
I don't know how.
I mean, I just stuck my hands into the clay and it happened.
You look at me.
You have a gift.
Jeff's competitive side had come out before, he had even displayed envy, but on that first day of Pottery class Abed.
Yeah?
What did we discuss?
No voiceover.
I'm sorry.
It is kind of a crutch.
I've never been on a boat before.
I didn't know what to wear.
Yeah, it's intimidating.
We're in Pierce's world now.
He's got all the boat clothes, and look at him christen.
If that were me, I would have broken the bottle.
I'm Professor Slaughter.
Welcome aboard the S.S. Nose Candy, purchased through government auction.
Oh, that's nice.
It's not nice.
It's your only weapon against the raging sea.
If you don't know how to use her, you're dead.
Together, you will work as one crew.
You will succeed or fail as one crew.
You will consider this parking lot the ocean.
Whatever you drop, you lose.
Mishandle the sails, you capsize and die.
Now, does Little Miss Nice have a name?
Shirley Bennett.
Well, now you're Captain Shirley Bennett.
Aw, man.
You will follow her every order.
Oh.
I've never been a captain before.
I have.
I commanded a jet ski through an electrical storm and only had one casualty.
Jet skis only hold two people.
Exactly.
Saved half the crew.
Pottery is much cooler than I thought.
And harder.
Well, except for that guy Rich.
He's like a natural.
Yeah.
I'm worried about the effect that it's having on Jeff, though.
Yeah, someone call a shrink.
What?
Well, you're usually the cool one.
Abed, you understand the point of a blow-off class is to blow it off?
Not to be cool at making really important mud pies.
Not willing to admit he's talented?
No, because he's not.
If I ever make an effort in that class, you'd think I was the cat's pajamas.
"Cat's pajamas"?
Okay, Pierce.
Wow.
Somebody's mommy gave him too much praise.
Man, so did someone's psych teacher.
Oh, Señor Chang.
Yes, I was robbed at the YMCA.
Again.
All right, let's do this.
Jeff, do you know what you are?
You're special.
You're very special, Jeff.
You're the most special little boy in the world.
Take her back to harbor.
Flank the sheets and trim the headsail.
Eyes on me for a moment.
I don't see students here, I see seamen.
And I didn't create them.
From the moment you climbed aboard, I saw seamen inside you.
More importantly, you've stopped giggling at the word "seamen".
And that's the mark of a real seaman.
All right, as you were.
Okay, then.
Crew, make fast the topping lift.
I'll get the rope.
Oh, my God.
Damn.
He's ghost riding the jib.
Pierce, hang on.
That hat's gone.
Lost at sea.
I might be able to reach it.
It landed on that Hyundai.
I mean, mermaid's car.
Get back on this boat.
No, no, no.
Well, I spoke too soon.
Everybody gets a D. If I had chosen to hit you with a storm just then, you all would have failed.
You better get your crew in line, captain.
Permission to speak?
Mm-hm.
You really screwed the pooch on that one, captain.
And I can't swim.
So, you see, ladies, it's actually a working fountain with a bird.
Heh, heh, heh.
Hey, Jeff, ready to make some art in the shape of a vase?
No, can't.
Ooh, ouch.
Let me take a look.
Rich, being good at Beginner Pottery doesn't mean you can heal people.
That's true.
But my medical degree does.
I'm a doctor.
A doctor?
I just take pottery to unwind.
I haven't lost a patient in five years.
Puts a lot of pressure on a person.
So the good news is this is neither sprained nor broken.
Oh, thank God.
But I'll have to get a second opinion from a guy in my basket-weaving class.
That's great.
It's funny.
Good to see you getting along with Rich.
What's he like?
He's a ringer.
A what?
You know, a con man, a grifter, a ringer.
He's an expert potter who signs up for novice classes to impress people.
If he wants to impress, why join a pottery class?
Why not just say, "Hi, I'm a doctor"?
Because he's crazy.
And fancy jobs don't impress people.
You weren't impressed I'm a lawyer.
Anyone can be a lawyer.
You can even represent yourself.
You can't do surgery on yourself.
It's illegal.
You'd get arrested.
And then you'd get a free lawyer.
Rich showed me how to make a flared lip on my pot and check for breast lumps.
Ha.
I don't know how, and I don't know when, but one day that guy is gonna slip up and when that happens, I am gonna be there to expose him.
Jeff, check it out.
If your finger's still bugging you, just get creative.
I wanna kiss you on the mouth.
I'm sorry?
Hey, Rich.
Hey.
Don't run so fast, you're among friends.
How you doing, Jeff?
What's up?
Not much, nada mucho.
Noddily Merchant.
Just want to thank you, Doc Potterywood, for taking a look at my finger.
Anytime.
Doc Potterywood, I like it.
Have you taken many pottery classes?
No, this is my first.
Of the year?
Ever.
No pottery at doctor school?
Medical school?
Pottery school.
Pottery school?
Oh, pottery school?
How long?
Jeff, it's kind of weird, I feel I'm being interrogated, but by someone who doesn't really wanna know anything important.
Oh, hey, New Mexico.
Long way from home.
Yeah.
Well, I did my residency in Santa Fe.
Santa Fe.
Yeah.
Can I give you a lift somewhere?
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm getting there.
Did you sleep here?
Only for a few hours.
Guess where Rich is from.
Couldn't have been Crazy Town.
You'd have gone to school together.
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Nobody gets out of Santa Fe without learning to make a pot.
Forty-five percent Hispanic.
Fifth-highest Native American population.
They eat and breathe clay there.
I think some of this research may have been done on Wikipedia.
You're mocking me?
You?
No, you, fine, go ahead, mock me.
Oh, Jeff, you're Goldblum-ing.
Goldblum-ing?
Heh.
What?
I, uh I don't even know what that means.
Look, I have work to do before class because I wanna catch Rich when he slips up.
But who even cares if he's pretending to be a beginner?
Pottery cares.
Integrity cares.
Look, I don't care.
I just care that he cares.
It's lame that he cares.
Shoelace came untied.
Could happen to anybody.
That's your excuse?
Britta weighs 5 pounds.
Troy can't swim.
I've never seen the ocean.
Uh, I can swim, racist.
Listen to me.
On my boat, the crew comes first.
No single person is above it.
You either shape up or ship the hell out.
Now I know what the C in captain stands for.
Crab apple.
Shirley, I thought you said that kind people were always kind.
Yes.
And strong people change.
If the sea was always still and calm, nobody would respect her.
I'm like the sea.
Hey.
Cuckoo birds, do you mind?
This is important.
College is where most mental problems activate.
I hope I get multiple personalities.
I get lonely in long showers.
The barometer's dropping.
The temperature is warm, but we're heading into a high-pressure flow.
That's a perfect storm.
Reef the mainsail and furl the jib.
Is that nautical talk or urban speak?
We have to turn back.
Accidental jibe.
Hit the deck.
Oh!
Man overboard.
Oh, my God, Pierce is dead!
No, wait.
His stomach is moving.
Oh, my God.
Pierce.
That's it.
Pull me in.
The storm is overtaking you, captain.
We don't have time.
I'm trying as hard as I can.
I have skinny arms for a quarterback.
I said, we don't have time.
What?
No.
Pull Wait.
Pull me in.
What do you mean, "time"?
That's it.
What?
No.
No!
Bring the boom amidship.
No!
No!
What in God's name have we done?
Hey.
Get out of my parking spot, dipwad.
Security.
I mean, take an intermediate class if you're an intermediate.
Don't come in here making your fear of failure our problem.
I mean, it's crazy.
It's crazy.
I mean, he's a crazy person.
I'm scared.
It's okay.
This is good for him.
He's confronting his own limitations.
Busted.
Fatal mistake, Richy boy.
You are busted.
I am?
You just used the "throwing off the hump" method.
That's an advanced pottery technique, which I know because last night I read the entire Encyclopedia of Pottery.
What are you talking about?
You are no beginner, Santa Fe.
Hey, what is going on, my blueberries?
Show him what you did.
No.
I rest my case.
What case?
Throw the freaking hump, imposter.
What are you doing?
No.
Hey!
Hey!
It's the hilarious guy-on-guy.
One rule I asked you to follow.
One.
Look.
Oh!
I had it made before he died.
It's not in bad taste.
Out, Winger.
Fine.
That's fine.
No, that's fine.
Congratulations.
You've failed a class so easy that people passing in the hallway get a contact credit.
No, this is abuse!
This is abuse!
Pierce.
Do you still have the number of that private investigator you used when you thought Ross Perot was sleeping with your mom?
Is this about that guy in your class?
Yeah.
Face the facts.
This kid's got some natural talent you just don't have.
How would you know?
It's all over the school.
Great.
Why aren't you in sailing class?
They drowned me.
Why?
For a better grade.
But weren't we discussing your flaws, Jeff?
Why are you letting this guy get to you?
What's really going on?
I made a bad pot.
For some reason, I always thought that I was special and different.
And I guess I just have a really hard time when I want to be good at something and I suck.
Uh-huh.
Here, give me a hand.
What are you doing?
I'm going back to my sailing class.
After they murdered you?
Jeffrey, when I was born, I got my umbilical cord wrapped around my neck, both arms and one of my ankles.
Mom said there came a point when the doctors stopped delivering me and just started laughing.
Heh.
I mean, if I ever let being bad at something stop me, I wouldn't even be here.
That thing some men call failure?
I call living.
Breakfast.
And I'm not leaving till I've cleaned out the buffet.
Now, how about a shove?
Good luck, Pierce.
Don't need it.
Never had it.
Britta, trim the boom flat.
Troy, sit windward to heel the boat.
My, the sea has a worthy opponent.
Oh, my God, it's Pierce.
Man, that guy's life is one big joke.
I mean, I feel bad for him, but things have been running smoother since he drowned.
I bet he gets that all the time.
Oh.
Oh.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, my God.
It's going down.
Pierce is going to be the only person ever to drown in a parking lot, twice.
Help!
Damn the storm.
We're going after Pierce.
Jump the halyard.
Star-Burns, get down there and man the iron jinny.
There's a man overboard.
That's an order.
I'm gonna sink.
I'm about to get the only A I will ever get, and Pierce isn't even dying.
Bailing.
You don't have to do this.
I know.
But I'd rather be kind and get stepped on every once in a while than be a hard-ass and turn my back on a friend.
Hoist the mains.
I don't want to go this way.
We're coming, Pierce.
Help.
How's it looking?
We've gotta go faster.
Okay, come on, Star-Burns.
It's filling with water.
It's going down.
Pierce, we're coming.
Dear God.
Dear God.
Oh, yes.
Oh, Britta.
Troy.
Here you go.
We gotcha.
Here you go.
Okay.
Are you okay?
You all right?
You just steered your boat into a storm.
Any last words?
The sea may be cold and unforgiving, but I'm not.
The ship might go down but at least she'll go down with honor.
Then I'll take your captain's hat because I'm promoting you to admiral.
You all get an A. Oh.
Admiral Shirley.
I like that.
Well, it means nothing, really, the class is over.
But you deserve it.
Hey, somebody has to do this.
I'm king of the Don't ruin a perfect week.
I'm not gonna spoon you again.
I appreciate that.
Yeah, I can't fully explain my behavior.
I'd love to blame booze or demon possession You know what?
Don't worry about it.
I'm bad at holding grudges.
Well, I'm bad at pottery.
I'm an amateur pottery enthusiast trying as hard as I can at something I suck at.
It's great.
And the teacher said I could stay if I don't have any more Ghost bursts.
Fantastic.
Well, good luck.
Don't need it.
Jeff, you're a normal person.
There's nothing very special about you at all.
You're going to be great at a few things but really crappy at many more.
And that takes a lot of the pressure off so you can live a full, happy life.
Oh, and sorry it took me so long to tell you that and it was only in your imagination.
My bad.
Kind of a sloppy mom.
That's okay, Mom.
Nobody's perfect.
I'm still scared.
A clay ashtray.
You're an idiot.
Why do you have time to make pottery?
Couldn't you use a little more practice being a doctor?
Not that it'll ever bring your brother back to life.
It was supposed to be you on that roller coaster, Richard.
It was supposed to be you.
Whoo!
Oh, come on.
Again?
Good grief.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Good morning, Greendale.
As you know, it is April Fools' Day.
Just kidding.
It's the day before April Fools.
See what I did there Baba booey, baba booey, baba booey You know what, Leonard?
Strike two.
Anyway, just reminding you to keep any April Fools pranks physically safe, politically balanced and racially accessible.
When in doubt, check the guidelines in our college pranks literature.
Guidelines for school-sanctioned pranks.
Hmm.
Reminds me of my favorite college comedy.
Oh, uh, which one?
Exactly.
See, the dean doesn't get it.
The point of a practical joke is to shake up the system.
For example, who wants some of these?
Cool, yeah.
Looking for something?
Nice.
Oh.
They allow volunteers for campus security during times of heightened shenanigans.
Oh.
I wanna be security.
Ooh.
Let's do it together.
We can be partners.
That's a buddy cop movie I would watch.
But I wonder, Which of you would be by the book?
Which of you would be the badass?
Oh, Abed, you're so silly.
I would be the badass.
Greetings, mortals.
Morning.
Snake in a can?
Uh No, thanks.
I'm fasting.
My Buddhist church is having its annual ascension ceremony, and I will be becoming a level-six laser lotus.
I know.
I was speechless too.
Anyway, I have to detoxify for the ceremony.
I get all the nutrients I need with saltwater and honey.
It's better if it goes down the wrong pipe.
So, what happens in level six?
Well, nobody in my hive has ever seen a six, but, uh, from what I hear, I'll have immunity to germs, a heightened psychic ability and improved night vision.
Any bonuses to your combat score?
I assume I'll fight better if I can see more, heh, dumb-ass.
Hey, Pierce, I just remembered.
Right before you got here, some guy was delivering level-six ceremonial robes?
What?
Why didn't you tell me?
Maybe if you run you can catch him.
Way to use your brain, Winger.
Abed, how fast can you run to the Theater Department?
Thirty-seven seconds.
Don't come back without something ridiculous.
Go.
Guys, you realize you're exploiting the naiveté of a man who is being brainwashed by a cult.
Well, it sounds a lot less fun when you say it.
Everything does.
She's a buzz kill.
I'm not a buzz kill.
Hmm.
Yeah, that doesn't really describe it.
You're more of a fun-vampire, because you don't suck blood, you just suck.
He wasn't there.
Oh, I think Abed found him.
Hey, give me.
It's amazing.
Wow.
It is absolutely gorgeous.
How do I look?
May I?
Yeah.
Magical.
Great.
Heh.
Of course, the only one who doesn't like this is Britta.
You ever get tired of being a buzz kill?
This is gonna be exciting, ladies.
I hereby deputize you as campus security for 48 hours.
Your windbreakers.
Your whistles.
Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
Uh Okay.
Now I only have the one pepper spray.
It's mine.
But I'll just get my groceries in a better neighborhood this week.
I'll carry it.
Oh.
Between the two of us, I'm sort of the badass.
You are?
Uh H-how do you figure?
I don't know, Shirley.
How did you figure I wasn't?
I guess I didn't figure because I was too busy being the obvious badass.
Sounds like we're both pretty convinced.
I guess we'll find out once we're on the job.
Hmm.
I guess we will.
I'm sorry, what is going on here?
A twist on a classic formula.
Normally, with buddy cops, one's a straight-laced stickler, the other's a renegade.
But these two have equal claim to both roles.
And why are you here?
Short answer?
My cable went out.
Hey, can I run something by you?
I was thinking of pulling a little prank tonight.
All right.
April Fools prank.
So you know how they have live frogs in the anatomy lab?
Oh, yeah.
So I was gonna sneak in there, get a frog, and then tomorrow when Señor Chang's class is coming in, there will be a frog on his desk wearing Tada.
Oh, you're done.
Did you read the hat?
"Señor Chang".
Yeah.
Oh, you don't get it.
I guess I don't.
The frog is Chang.
Okay, I did get it.
It's funny.
I know it's funny.
Oh, wait, I forgot.
It's not your kind of joke.
It's not at anyone's expense.
Britta, why waste your time envying my gift for levity?
When there's so much you could be doing with your natural talent for severity.
You know what?
My prank is gonna cause a sea of laughter, and I'm gonna watch you drown in it.
Thattagirl.
Seven.
That's right.
Jeff, I can read minds.
No way.
What color am I thinking of?
Pink.
What the hey?
Must be the robe.
Hey, Cookie Crisp.
Cookie Crisp.
No.
Is he talking to me?
No, no.
Hey, Pierce, that guy came back that brought your robes and said he forgot to deliver this.
What is it?
He said it focuses your powers?
Is that a cookie?
Oh!
Maybe it's a piece of meteor.
Buddha arrived on a meteor.
When's the last time he ate?
I am the coolest guy in the world.
Hello, Mr. Frog.
Can I just borrow you for a second?
I'm Señor Chang.
Now tell me that's not funny.
Aah!
Oh!
Oh, no.
Wait.
Here, froggy, froggy, froggy.
Here frog, frog, froggy.
Mr. Frog?
Real quiet.
Oh, no.
Uhn!
Yaah!
Oh.
Oh, my God!
Aah!
Call the ambulance!
It's so horrible.
It's a dead body.
And what makes it worse is this was a brand new sign, so I just don't want this to tarnish our school's reputation.
Don't worry.
Your school's reputation is way worse than this.
Oh, here's our campus security.
Just stop right there.
Oh, ladies, don't pull up on the Okay.
Oh, Annie.
Morning, boys.
I'm Annie Edison.
But people call me Psycho because I had a nervous breakdown in high school.
My partner is a Christian housewife.
Can we help you?
Actually, can we not help you?
I tend to play by my own rules.
She loves rules.
I only have one.
Stay out of my way.
Stay out of mine more.
You know what?
This is misdemeanor vandalism.
You ladies can take care of it yourselves.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
What?
Call us when you find a perp.
Yeah, heh, we'll be waiting.
Oh You go.
Uh, I'm about to.
Now look what you have done.
Tell them they got 24 hours to solve the case.
They do.
You have 24 hours to solve it or else.
Figure it out.
That's the poster.
So this is the part of my job that I enjoy the least.
The part where I inform you that last night, someone murdered a partially clothed animal and threw a human corpse out a window.
And you can thank the person that did it, a person that may be in this room, for the fact that from now on, April Fools' Day is banished, okay?
At Greendale, April 1 st is officially March 32nd forever.
How do you know it was one of us?
Well, if I may answer a question with a question, why are you dressed like a wizard?
Okay, is he having a stroke?
I'll tell you how I know.
Security Officers Bennett and Edison found this at the scene.
Hmm?
The little hat says "Chang" on it.
And we ruled out your teacher because he has a crippling fear of frogs.
I told you that in confidence.
How about whoever did this just fesses up?
All right, that wasn't just a cadaver that was thrown out that window.
It was a person with family and friends.
And for every day that nobody confesses, this class will be meeting one of them.
Hmm?
Glenda?
Oh, I apologize.
Can you come on in here.
Hmm?
Yes.
And tell us about your son.
Oh, yeah.
Hello, everyone.
Hello.
There.
Harry was a wonderful man.
He kept a dream journal.
Page one.
"I had that dream again where I'm in a forest but the trees are pencils".
Hey.
Impressive.
And hilarious.
Hmm.
You gonna fess up, weirdo?
Look, it wasn't me.
Even if it was, this was an accident.
I knew it.
Nicely done.
If I come forward, it's gonna play into the "Britta's a buzz kill" mythology.
Well, the toe tag fits, Britta.
I mean, you single-handedly killed an entire school's buzz, not to mention a frog.
According to Glenda, cadaver Harry had that I'm not interested in meeting.
So you better think about coming clean, or I'm just gonna tell everybody you did it.
Star-Burns doesn't do very much.
I guess fascinating people don't resort to growing shapes on their faces.
He makes one false move, and I'm gonna go Shirley on him.
That's what my high school friends called crazy.
Yeah?
You gonna go Shirlier than I did when I got addicted to pills?
Why are you so concerned with being badass?
Maybe I'm tired of everyone thinking of me as a little girl.
Maybe I wanna be in charge of how I'm defined.
Well, how do you think I feel?
You have two kids, and they stick you in the margins.
I'm not done yet.
I still got moves.
I haven't even started yet.
I've got moves I haven't even seen before.
Blocked call.
Mm.
Edison.
The man you're looking for is Jeff Winger.
Jeff Winger.
Who is this?
I didn't recognize the voice.
They say Jeff Winger's our man.
Oh.
Drop them if you smoke them.
Cut to action sequence.
Let's roll.
Security's coming through.
Mr. Winger.
Cagney, Lacey.
What can I do you for?
Just doing a routine search.
What is this?
What do you have here?
That's my chest.
Why don't you spread them?
Huh?
What are you packing here?
Guys.
I can pat.
I can do it too.
So, uh, what have you got in the bag?
Yeah.
What the?
Hey.
Let's see what we have here.
Holy Mary, mother of pearl.
What do we have here, huh?
Looks like enough tiny items to equip an amphibious mariachi band.
Of frogs.
That is not my stuff.
Britta.
Britta planted that.
Sure she did.
Tell that to what our equivalent of a judge is.
Wait.
What is?
He's getting away.
Go, go.
Drive.
When you turn to yell at me He's right there.
Okay, hold it What are these doing here?
He's getting away.
Go after him on foot.
I'm going after him on foot.
Cut him off on the other side.
I'm cutting him off on the other side.
Stop or I'll shoot.
I said, stop.
Oh, God, no.
Aah!
Aah!
It burns.
Uh-huh.
Oh, great, he got away.
Good job.
He got away because of your driving, Grandma.
Oh, I beg your pardon, Hannah Montana.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you hard of hearing?
You know what?
This is why you have hardly any friends.
Looks like I have one less now.
Do I look like I'm crying?
These are not tears.
This is self-inflicted friendly fire, okay?
That's what happens to children.
You have no idea what I've been through!
You don't think I've got the strength for this!
Excuse me.
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'll give you the rest of these chocolate-covered raisins if you save my seat.
- To be alone out there.
You are assuming I don't want you to feel judged by this, but your handling of this job has disappointed me.
I mean, your high-speed pursuit caused $ 78 worth of damages.
And you didn't even get a statement out of Mr. Winger?
He got away.
He ran between two poles.
Well, I see how that would be frustrating but the fact is, Your ass is on the line.
My ass is on the line.
You just got off the phone with the mayor.
I just got off the phone What?
The mayor?
Stop doing that.
I'm trying to help.
You're not doing this right.
Well, maybe you should do it.
I am sick and tired of making excuses for you two.
You're an embarrassment to the department.
You're off the case and off the force.
Your badges, your windbreakers now.
Now.
I ain't got all day.
Agitating my sciatica.
I'm too old for this.
Now get out of my sight.
Thought you were badasses, huh?
Real badasses work together.
Hmm.
All I see is a housewife and girl scout.
Hey.
Abed.
I said, get out.
And don't even think about getting near this case.
Uh-uh.
Pretty harsh.
Don't worry, that's what they needed.
Well, that was embarrassing.
I know.
That African-American police chief character Abed was playing was right.
We should have worked as a team.
I don't know about you, I don't need a badge to finish this.
I say we nail Winger to the wall.
Together?
Together.
How do you spell "testicles"?
Nice frame job, Britta-dict Arnold.
Oh, colonial burn.
Come on, Jeff, where's that trademark gift for levity?
Well, well, well, look who we found.
Yes, how foolish of me to hide in my regularly scheduled study group.
Jeff, ahem, let's just do this the easy way.
Confess.
Britta's the one who threw that body out the window.
And I can prove it.
How?
Britta was going to put a frog wearing a sombrero on Chang's desk because that's the kind of thing she thinks is funny.
Don't you, Britta?
No.
Then why is there a photo on your Facebook page of a cat wearing a necktie?
Pfft.
This is my cat.
And the tie makes him?
Formal.
This investigation is going nowhere.
You need a psychic.
Perfect.
This process may alarm you.
Oh!
Gay, gay, gay.
So gay.
Oh-oh.
Dark nightclub.
Aah, aah.
Throbbing music.
Men's room Men's room stall.
Penis.
Two penises.
Oh.
So gay.
He's so gay.
Pierce.
What?
Sit down.
We'll take it from here.
Uhn.
Jeff, where were you last night?
At a bar.
Called it.
Who can confirm that?
Your mama?
What?
While I'm Oh!
Oh!
What the hell, Annie?
Her name's not Annie, it's Psycho.
If I were you, I'd tell her what she wants to hear.
That's right, because if I have to hand you off to Shirley, you're gonna enter a kitchen of pain.
Uhn!
Guys, stop it.
Stop it.
I did it.
I framed Jeff.
I'm sorry, Jeff.
But why?
Because I'm a buzz kill, that's why.
Because that's who I am.
That's my role.
You guys, you create fun, and I destroy it.
Of course a silly little joke ends with a dead body on the lawn.
I should have known that but I wanted to do it anyway.
I wanted to be like you.
I wanted to be funny.
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Cancer.
Oh, good, come on in.
I thought it was Britta.
Well Britta, I actually wanna be taken more seriously.
And the only reason I slammed Jeff's head against the table was because I wanted to feel like an adult.
Like Shirley.
And I wanted to feel younger like Annie.
It's not that I'm really old because people don't know how young I really am.
See?
I'm doing it again.
I hate that I obsess about my age.
Oh, I know.
I wish I was really magic.
Heh.
You know you're not?
Yeah.
Hah.
Somebody must have sent these robes by accident.
I only pretended I was level six to impress you guys.
I got held back.
I don't even deserve this Buddhist meteor wand.
Oh.
It's not a meteor.
It's a cookie wand.
Me and Jeff made it because it made you look like the Cookie Crisp wizard.
Which is not even a reference I get because the Cookie Crisp mascot wasn't a wizard when I was a kid, it was a burglar.
I just pretended like I knew because I wanted Jeff to think I was smart.
Great.
I did it again.
I killed the buzz.
Look, um Maybe Maybe "buzz kill" is a bad choice of words.
What's a good choice of words?
I don't know.
l I, um I You're You're like the dark cloud that unites us.
Or the The anti-Winger.
You're like You're You're the heart of this group.
Uh Look, um, I don't have a real handle on all this mushy stuff.
If If I did, then we wouldn't need you.
Britta, get over here.
Really?
Yeah.
Let's never let Jeff divide us again.
Hey, Abed.
Why are you and I the only sane?
Shh.
Just watch.
It's beautiful.
Troy, do you want a bite of my wand?
I do.
We really appreciate you doing this.
Sure.
And three, two, one.
# Troy and Abed in the morning ## And we're back.
Look who's here, Jeff Winger.
Jeff, how do you stay so fit?
Uh Diet, exercise, genetics.
Sure, sure.
Okay.
So it seems we have a clip.
You wanna set up for us?
Uh, I'd like to but I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay, we'll just roll it.
Ooh.
My name's Jeff Winger.
Hey.
I'm Jeff Winger.
I'm so tall.
This watch is expensive.
Muscles are everywhere.
That was funny.
What's going on?
Where are the cameras?
We're not filming this.
No.
Who'd wanna watch this?
Guys, it's 6 a.m. Jeez.
We're not gonna have him back.
# Troy and Abed in the morn ## No!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
I think I'm failing Psychopharmacology.
Why are you taking that?
I thought it was a class about crazy farm animals, okay?
Let's finish the unit.
I don't wanna be late for lunch.
Amar is to love, right?
Oh, speaking of love, Shirley, how's it going with the sexy dreadlock guy?
Oh, I'm sure I don't have a chance with him.
Abed and I talked to him by the vending machine.
He asked about you.
He specifically asked about me?
When Annie brought you up, he specifically asked, "Who is that"?
Abed.
Oh.
What?
That's what he said.
Abed, your social skills aren't exactly streets ahead.
You know what I mean?
I don't.
You're not alone in this case.
Pierce.
Stop trying to coin the phrase, "Streets ahead".
Trying?
Ha, ha.
Coined and minted.
Been there, coined that.
"Streets ahead" is verbal wildfire.
Does it just mean cool, or is it supposed to be like miles ahead?
If you have to ask, you're streets behind.
Okay.
We can banter if we wanna banter.
But I'm leaving for lunch early.
Me too.
Me three.
Streets ahead.
Man, you guys really love these stupid chicken fingers, huh?
They're not stupid, they're the only good thing in the cafeteria.
I haven't had one in weeks.
They run out so fast.
If God were edible, not that I'm Catholic, but if it was cool to eat God, he'd be a chicken finger.
Mm-hm.
Well, I wouldn't know.
I'm a vegetarian.
Oh, shocker.
Yeah.
And if you guys knew how they treated the animals that you're eating, you'd eat them even faster just to put them out of their misery.
And then you would throw up.
I don't know, maybe I'm feeling extra protective of animals today because my cat is sick.
Oh, a cat?
That's awful.
He has diabetes.
He can't even make it to the litter box.
Chicken run.
Whoo!
I'm afraid that I'm gonna have to put her to sleep and Mm-hm.
Aw, go on.
God bless you.
Save some for me.
Watch out.
Oh.
I can hear those fingers calling my name.
Troy.
Troy, Troy.
Did you get my text message?
Did you get my text message?
I think it's Hi.
I gotta stop hanging out with her.
She sounds like a chicken finger.
Again?
Outrageous.
At least apologize.
How can you just stand there like a mute idiot?
Ooh.
Well, throat surgery might humanize you.
But it doesn't make this acceptable.
So cute.
And I don't even normally like dreadlocks.
Hello.
His dreadlocks remind me of the Predator.
Which is weird because you're doing the actual hunting, and you seem invisible to him.
Abed, you know what I do?
Before I talk, I ask myself: "What am I about to say?
And how might it affect each person listening"?
I'm really glad you said that, Britta.
The idea that you compulsively filter yourself makes your lack of flavor kind of a flavor.
Sorry, guys, they ran out again.
Something's gotta be done.
Oh, I love chicken fingers.
Hey.
Oh, you're the man.
What the hell, man?
That's half our problem right there.
Star-Burns works the fryer and skims fingers.
No way.
He gives them to people just so they'll act like he isn't Star-Burns.
Well, I may not eat meat, but I am not gonna eat that injustice.
Let's complain.
Yeah.
If we complain, he gets a warning and learns to be sneakier.
I say we knock him out of the kitchen and replace him with one of our own all in one move.
Then we're the ones with the chicken.
It's like a mafia movie.
As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be in a mafia movie.
Cool.
That's exactly what it's like, Abed.
And you get the most important job.
You're gonna be fry cook.
We may be watching different mafia movies.
You worked in your dad's restaurant, right?
Well, you'll apply for the job after we get Star-Burns fired.
I don't know.
I don't know about the firing.
I think he really relies on that income.
Yeah, man.
Every day you flock here like sheep and wait in line for a broken promise from a dirty system.
Back in those days, Jeff Winger was the guy that made things happen.
He always knew what to say, and he always knew when to slap the table.
You wanna be sheep, keep flocking.
You wanna be wolves, form a pack.
And that was it.
It was that simple.
At that moment, we stopped being a family and started being a family in italics.
Britta got cozy with Star-Burns.
Can I touch both of?
Oh.
Yeah.
He lowered his guard.
He was gone.
I mean, the way Jeff saw it, by not respecting us, Star-Burns had basically brought it on himself.
And when his job opened up, we did what we had to do to keep the list of applicants to a minimum.
I had worked in my dad's falafel restaurant , so I had a pretty impressive resume.
It's very impressive.
Especially your reference.
Just give them a call right now.
But we weren't taking any chances.
The fix was in.
Trump Tower, this is Donald.
Well, he can deep-fry the hell out of chicken I can tell you that.
Troy even applied for the same job and gave the world's worst interview.
Just to make me look better, and that was that.
This was the glorious time.
No more racing to the cafeteria.
No more lines.
To us, lines were for suckers, hacks, sheep.
We were wolves.
And we had the chicken to prove it.
To victory.
It feels unfamiliar, but it tastes like chicken.
Hi.
Hello.
You guys are lucky.
They're always running out.
Would you like one?
The name's Shirley, memorize it.
I will, Shirley.
See that, ladies?
The universe goes by supply and demand.
The more you take and use, the more it sends.
Somebody's been taking a little extra.
What's in that container?
Eight fingers.
Abed.
Abed's study group.
Why you giving Chang chicken?
We have an agreement.
If you get caught skimming, you get fired.
We all go back to eating like Britta.
Yeah, we put you in that job.
I dressed like a crazy pharaoh for you, man.
You make the fingers, Abed, not the decisions.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, buddy.
But just remember, these things have power.
So just let me know next time you have any more agreements, all right?
Yeah, I agreed to give Chang eight fingers per lunch in exchange for a 10 percent bump on every Spanish test for each of us.
Oh.
Okay, Abed makes the fingers and the decisions.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass Spanish class.
Oh, Abed, you're the best.
At Greendale, they were always out of chicken fingers.
So whoever could get them had power.
And I the guy was in the apron, so I came up with a system.
And pretty soon half the chicken at Greendale was going out the side door.
Everybody in our crew had a job.
T- Bone was the bag man.
He'd move the fingers to a storeroom where two of the girls did the packaging.
We could trust them not to eat the supply because Britta was a vegetarian.
And Shirley figured that if she stole, she'd go to hell.
They'd hand the stuff out the window to Annie.
She was the leg man, the distributor.
The crazy thing was, it was their food.
And we were stealing it and giving it back to them like it was a big favor.
Nobody asked any questions, because Pierce's experience as a CEO had taught him how to keep the wheels from squeaking.
I had it all worked out on a schedule.
You know, I've never been fired.
The minute before you thought about busting us, that was the minute you had chicken in your hand.
It's just insulting that you're eating his chicken fingers in front of me.
Everyone had their hand out.
Everyone wanted what we had.
Oh.
Well, here you go.
And Jeff had the most important job of all.
He was at the top.
He was the boss.
He was our leader.
What the hell is going on?
AV kids hooked it up.
Abed supplied the whole department with chicken fingers.
You think that's good, check out my posse and Troy's monkey.
Troy, why do you have a monkey?
It's an animal that looks like a dude.
Why don't I have 10 of them?
Guys, look at what Abed scored for me.
It has a million zippers, and it was free.
Oh, robot.
I am a robot.
I am programmed to love this backpack.
This is insane.
More insane than programming them to replace auto workers?
What?
Okay, okay, if you're not in this study group, please No, no.
That means you, sexy dreadlocks.
Britta's hairdresser.
What?
Pierce's hackneyed entourage.
Hackneyed?
You see the turban guy?
Yes, in a '90s ski movie that featured an entourage.
Don't you guys think this is getting out of hand?
We're not gonna get caught.
We have campus security on the take.
Abed's got it all figured out.
Well, that's a relief.
Yeah.
It's pretty cool being friends with the biggest man on campus.
Isn't that right, Annie's Boobs?
Please rename that thing.
And this time, not with a contest on Twitter.
It's his Twitter account.
He can do what he wants.
They are my body parts.
Know what I don't appreciate?
I do not consent to this.
You'll be begging for his company.
I own that.
I wouldn't threaten a monkey.
They have more lactic acid than us.
Shared my chicken with him.
Talk to the backpack.
You're the worst, Annie.
Streets ahead.
Now, where's he going?
Line starts behind you.
Oh, he's cool.
Six fingers every Wednesday.
Cool.
And what can you offer?
I have a bicycle.
And I teach beginner's tennis.
Cool, okay.
Six fingers Wednesdays, all right.
We'll be in touch, Janel.
Thank you, Abed.
You're welcome.
Hey, Jeff.
Hey, buddy.
It's quite a setup you got here.
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it.
It turns out everyone has needs and everyone has functions.
Look, I've been thinking.
Maybe I need to hit the big red button and bring an end to this operation.
I mean, it's been fun, but it's out of control now.
Am I right?
I don't know.
The entire campus is controlled by our group.
Our group is controlled by chicken, and the chicken is controlled by me.
Float?
I'm good.
Abed, the mafia movie is over.
I'm not doing a mafia movie.
In fact, I don't need to use movies or TV shows to talk to people anymore.
Before I only needed them because the day-to-day world made no sense to me.
But now, everyone's speaking the same language, chicken.
I understand people and they finally understand me.
Abed, eventually people are gonna get tired of chicken.
I'm tired of chicken.
You're not tired of chicken.
You miss the taste of control.
Well, that's crazy.
Is it?
Unfortunately, the very thing that drove you to this dorm room is what would prevent you from properly running this machine.
Or even being a cog in it, your ego.
I see.
I see, this has been about me the whole time.
You want a shot at the Jeff Winger throne?
You better bring a powerful ass.
Oh, and for your information, I don't have an ego.
My Facebook photo is a landscape.
You're the best, Eduardo.
Thank you all for coming.
Can we make this quick?
I need to give a banana to Annie's Boobs.
Abed is drunk with chicken power.
He's gone from lovable Johnny Five to evil HAL.
Hal Holb Not Hal Holbrook.
What are you saying?
You all have to stop working for him.
Let this operation dry up and let his wheels spin down.
At which point you would be in charge again, right?
What?
This is so sad.
You're jealous of Abed because he's providing for us.
No, I'm concerned about Abed because he won't listen to reason.
Won't listen to your reason.
Why should he?
Jeff's so not Say, "Streets ahead," and die.
Streets ahead.
You wanna boss me around?
Get me an entourage.
Get Troy a monkey.
That's what a real boss does.
Yes.
We probably shouldn't even be talking to him without checking with Abed.
I'm already trying him, he's not picking up.
What did you do with him?
I don't believe what greedy sellouts you people turned out to be.
I'm not gonna stand and be ignored.
Shh.
Voicemail.
Hey, Abed, Jeff says you're not listening to him.
Does that mean we shouldn't listen to him either?
Oh, also, should we make special jackets for our crime family?
Like blazers with chicken finger patches.
I don't know, long message, I'm sorry.
That's it.
Oh!
Abed.
Look, I'm walking out this door right now.
Okay.
Okay, bye.
For real.
Good.
I'm not gonna look back.
Mm-hm.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Abed.
Hi, hi, yeah.
Anybody need anything?
Oh, everything, you look handsome.
I like everything about you now.
You get the message?
I want a new hairdresser though.
Hey.
Oh.
How's my hair look?
Oh.
I like this.
Yeah, I got you fired.
You deserved it.
Maybe, maybe not.
The question is, what do they deserve?
Key to the kitchen.
There's a valve on the back of the chicken fryer that's not made anymore.
Now, say someone were to remove it.
The fryer wouldn't work.
Forever.
How petty do you think I am?
Jeff leaving the family didn't turn out to be a problem.
Okay, I think we're set for the quiz.
Yep.
See you guys in class.
Oh, wait, before you go.
Oh, free notebooks.
But the family's success started to go to their heads.
They didn't have college ruled?
No, sorry.
It's okay.
Abed?
Yeah?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.
We have a situation.
Hey.
Who is this?
It's Travis.
You said you wanted someone in your entourage named Travis.
Show him your license.
Travis is his middle name.
I go by Travis.
No, you go by the door.
See you, Travis.
Abed?
Yep?
No, no, no.
My monkey hates this caviar.
Troy, isn't that?
They were spoiled, fat, lazy.
I'd given them everything and somehow I'd lost their respect.
So I did the only thing I could think of.
I did what I thought Jeff would do.
I sent them a message.
Somebody's backpack.
These were the bad times.
There he is.
Jeff, Jeff.
Jeff.
Jeff.
Jeff, Abed killed my backpack.
I caught him stuffing my man full of chicken.
And Tyler Perry has a series of movies about why that's wrong.
That little Arab is off his rocker.
He released Annie's Boobs.
Annie's Boobs could be anywhere.
Could be We got it.
The monkey's name is Annie's Boobs.
Look what Abed did to my hair.
I feel terrible for all of you.
Wait, no, I don't, because I warned you about all this.
You were so high on your backpacks and hairstyles, you accused me of being jealous.
You were right.
But what can we do?
I'm sorry, you brushed over that first part.
Together.
You were right.
Now, what you can do is go home and write that on your bathroom mirror.
Wouldn't that make it seem like I was right?
Yeah.
I don't have a mirror.
It's not reversed because you're the You'd have the mirror behind you.
And I would like As for Abed, for his sake I guess I'll have to take him out.
Poor little guy.
Oh, good, that's nice.
Abed.
What are you doing?
Making Tater Tots.
You were right, people got sick of chicken, but I was close.
I just need a new food, a new system.
I'm gonna experiment with jalapeño poppers next, and then Zucchini Zircles.
I don't get it.
It's not that complicated, Jeff.
They replaced the C in circle with a Z for zucchini.
No, no, I mean, why are you here?
You said you were close?
What were you close to?
To the group?
To people?
Don't do a special episode about me.
Oh.
I wouldn't dream of it.
Everyone else needs my help.
That's what people don't get, is that they need to get me.
I just need to be able to connect to people like you can, and then I can make everyone happy.
Do you know why I'm here?
You got caught with a fake degree.
By the way, they started using that on Law & Order.
Total rip off.
I'm here to dismantle the fryer.
To cut your power off at its source.
Don't you see what happened?
I manipulated the group into getting you the fry cook job so I could have some chicken.
And you turned it all into a way to make everyone like you.
Made me ashamed of myself, made me jealous.
Maybe this is a special episode.
It's pretty alarming behavior, Jeff.
Yeah.
There's specialists you could talk to.
Maybe I should do that.
In the meantime, let's make a deal.
I'll help you connect with people, and you help me do a better job with them.
Like Knight Rider.
Exactly.
Like Knight Rider.
Deal.
I'll put on a leather jacket and make out with an aerobics instructor.
You pull around front and comedically startle passers-by with your ability to talk.
Maybe we should just stay here and have a plate of chicken fingers.
Cool.
Can we eat them while sitting on a table like in Sixteen Candles?
Pick one reference, Abed.
Sixteen Candles.
And just like that, the mafia movie was over.
I quit the fry cook job, somewhat for the sake of the family, but mostly for the sake of Jeff's ego, poor guy.
Things went back to normal.
Everyone's back to being a bunch of regular schnooks.
And I'm back to being a weirdo.
Back to watching from the outside for now.
There's still not enough chicken fingers.
No way, no seriously.
What?
As soon as our family moved out, a new syndicate moved in to take its place.
But you know what they'll never make a replacement for?
Friends.
Okay, thank you.
That's great, Abed.
But could you just answer the question?
What was it?
Do you know who might have stolen a box of hairnets from the kitchen?
Someone with hair.
I'm gonna write that down.
Ready?
Oh, that's nice.
Never been done.
Here I come.
Back up the same staircase.
It's good.
Double escalator.
Wow.
I haven't seen that before.
How did you think of that?
And now for our signature trick.
Awesome elevator.
No.
I can't do it.
I got babies.
I gotta get home.
It's their loss.
Yeah.
That was awesome.
Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hey, Britta, what are you gonna knitta?
Good mood, bad rhyme and is that a carb on your plate?
I got a B on my nutrition final and I am celebrating with pie and a dollop of whipped irony.
Nice.
I'm knitting something for my new cat.
It's been two weeks since I lost Suzie B, so I figured it was time to move on.
Not being an animal lover, I assume it'll nice to start over with a fresh kitten.
Fresh kitten?
I go to a shelter and rescue an animal that genuinely needs my help, okay?
Why do you think I am knitting a tiny, little eye patch?
Excuse me, hi.
We're in high school but we're taking classes for college credit.
Well, all right.
Way to be go-getters.
Thanks.
So we were just wondering, can you tell us exactly what you did in your lives to end up here so that we don't make the same mistakes?
Yeah, because if I end up 35 and celebrating a B in nutrition in community college, I'll kill myself.
Watch it.
Yeah, watch it.
Or what, schmitty?
Schmitty.
You gonna knit me something sad in your house full of cats with no furniture?
Listen, it is a studio apartment and knitting is hip.
Winona Ryder knits.
Who?
Schmitty.
Schmitty.
Schmits.
Schmitty.
I have done things with my life, awesome things.
I've been to 14 countries.
I helped build a school in Kenya.
I once met Sting at a Cracker Barrel.
Why are you letting a bunch of teenagers get to you?
I don't even remember what they said.
It just rolled Would you stop tuning that guitar?
You are 105 years old!
Tell me what you did with your life to end up here so I don't make the same mistakes!
Excuse me!
But it's springtime and I thought I might woo a few chicks.
# No one to watch While we're kissing # # No one to see while we spoon # # Let's take a trip in my airship # # And we'll visit the man In the moon ## Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell?
Hey, what?
What the hell?
Sorry.
Animal House.
A reference my ears applaud.
I couldn't resist.
Smashing the guitar of someone singing a love song was on my quintessential college experience list.
Your what?
It's a list of everything movies have taught me comprises a successful first year at college.
"Bond with a group of lovable misfits".
Check.
"Take on the school bully".
Check.
"Make out with the hottest girl".
Check-a-rooni.
You?
No.
Unfortunately, the school year is almost over and there's stuff left on the list.
I'll help you finish it.
I'll be like your Morgan Freeman.
Like in The Bucket List.
The what?
Stand up for a second.
Come over here.
Stand there.
Okay, turn around.
Okay.
What the hell?
Pantsing someone was on my list.
It would've been better if you were wearing the giant hearts underwear, but I'll take it.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I hope getting pantsed is on your list.
It is.
What's so funny?
This.
Ooh!
Get it?
Finally.
No, Pierce.
Shirley is way too angry to talk to you right now.
Yeah, you'll have to apologize later.
Apologize for what?
She should apologize to me.
She ruined my joke.
Oh, my God.
There's a grandpa schlip-schlap.
Have you seen my schmitty, sonny?
Help me, I'm gonna crap my pants.
Someone help me.
Seriously, nutrition, this is your life?
Actually, I was a lawyer.
Looks like that went well.
And now you hang out with schlip-schlap and schlap-skank Oh, my God, is she wearing a Discman?
How could you do this to me?
What?
Discmans are retro.
Oh, is retro when you're 30 and broke and can't afford an iPod, schmitty?
I think "schmitty" means loser.
We know.
We know.
You may come back in now.
I have something to say.
This better be a good apology.
This has been a long time coming.
We have joked and rolled eyes at him.
But there has been a transgression today.
And I will no longer continue to be a part of the group with this man.
Just skip to the "I'm sorry".
You are pathological and you will never change.
Ha!
That is the pot calling the kettle a kettle, okay?
Oh, you can say black, Pierce.
I'm a black woman.
The cat is out the bag.
You have literally identified me to strangers as "the black woman".
Out of context.
Context is everything.
I call the other women "flat-butt" and "the one Abed wants to nail".
Is that you?
Not me.
So, what's the context for constantly referring to me as a lesbian?
If the wallet chain fits I'm just trying to help you find yourself.
At least he doesn't think Shirley's my mom anymore.
He thinks we're cousins.
You're not?
He still assumes I'm a terrorist.
If you're not, I'm sorry.
If you are, I'm a hero.
I'm willing to take that chance.
You said I have a crafty Jew brain.
Nobody knows how to take a compliment anymore.
Look, either he leaves the group or I do.
You just dug your own grave.
Hey, what's up?
They kicked me out of the group.
Whoa.
Wanna buy some cookies?
Ten bucks a box.
Crap, damn it.
Have you seen a Chinese kid?
Twerps.
Oh, hey, Pierce.
How is it going?
Unrepentant child.
Such a child.
Oh, here comes stinky turd face.
Remember, we don't stop till he's crying.
Oh, check out Franken-mom.
Oh, we can use that.
And no wedding ring.
He's a child of divorce.
We can make fun of him for coming from a broken home.
I don't care if this gets dirty.
He asked for it.
You're right.
Get ready to meet Jeff Winger, esquire, attorney at "Ah, snap".
It will be better than that.
Hey, Clearasil, what time is your mommy picking you up?
After she's done shooting The Real Housewives of Greendale County?
"After she's done shooting The Real Housewives of Greendale County.
" Duh!
That's a clever retort.
"That's a clever retort".
Duh!
Brilliant.
"Brilliant".
Duh!
Your parents are divorced.
"Your parents are divorced".
Duh!
Pfft!
Duh!
Schmitty.
Forget it, come on.
Come on, forget this.
Duh!
Where you going, schmitty?
I'm sorry, little schmitty.
Mimicry is the lowest form Stop talking.
"Mimicry is the lowest form of" Stop talking.
Hi.
Hey, you two.
What is that?
It's Billy, City College's mascot.
Stealing a mascot was part of the list.
Check.
Bringing a goat to our study group, that's a great idea, Troy.
Thanks, must have been hard for you to say that.
It's called sarcasm, Troy.
Ask the goat to explain it to you.
Why do I feel like I'm being dissed?
Because you are being dissed.
Why are you two dissing Troy?
They no longer have Pierce.
What?
Pierce's universally recognized social flaws made him the scapegoat, a lightning rod.
Now he's gone, so there's lightning everywhere.
Sounds dangerous.
My uncle was struck by lightning.
You'd think it'd give superpowers, but now he just masturbates in theaters.
It's very dangerous.
We've lost our Cliff Clavin, our George Costanza, our Turtle or Johnny Drama or Eve.
Man, that show is sloppy.
What's gonna happen?
It's only a matter of time before one of us becomes the new Pierce.
Well, I sure as hell am not gonna be the new Pierce.
And if all we need is an escape-goat, I think we should just let this one go.
Sometimes, you've got to be pretending, Troy.
Maybe the new Pierce is Britta.
Yeah, right.
How do you pronounce bagel again?
Bagel.
She calls bagels, bagels.
We do make fun of a lot of what you do and say.
Yeah, right to my face, because I can take it, unlike a certain someone else.
Ah.
Ah.
Let's not make fun of Annie.
No, no.
I don't want pity.
Come to think of it, after Pierce, you're the most bigoted.
What?
You found out I was Jewish, you invited me to a "pool" party.
Turned out to be a baptism.
Excuse me for trying to sneak you into heaven.
What about Abed?
Abed's weird.
No, that's not it.
He's all right, we like Abed.
Guys, have you considered the new Pierce concept is stupid?
Spoken like the new Pierce.
You're right.
I am not the new Pierce.
You are too.
You said "the World Wide Web".
Damn the old Pierce.
He makes me mad.
Don't double Pierce me.
You're the triple Pierce.
That's so unfair.
Guys, guys.
I can't believe I'm gonna utter these words, but we need Pierce in this group.
But we can't ask Shirley to let him back in, that would be so insensitive.
Well, maybe he'll admit he's wrong.
Two, three, four, uh, not.
We need Pierce.
Just stick to the script and make it sincere.
It's not gonna be sincere, I'm pretending to apologize.
Okay, but you're not getting back into the group unless she thinks you're sincere.
Stubborn fool.
Can we, um, hurry this up?
Troy and I are pledging the cool fraternity.
Unbeknownst to us, we're the target of ridicule and don't have a chance of getting in.
Yeah.
They're making us walk around with pretzels in our butts.
I put mustard on mine like an idiot.
Okay, Pierce, you can do this.
What's he?
Yup.
Shirley, I know you don't wanna hear what I have to say, but I owe you this.
From the moment we first met, I knew you Seriously.
Oh.
Oh, Shirley.
Ha, ha.
I could have You are unbelievable.
I'm not wearing contacts.
These are mine, give them.
But I'm a bag guy.
You have the same bag.
So I thought, you know Right, nothing is ever your fault.
Screw you.
I don't owe you an apology.
They wrote this.
Pretend like you asleep, pretend like you asleep.
Thank you, now I fully understand where I have always stood.
I'm entitled to my pride until it gets in the way of what you guys want.
Got nothing to say?
Well, I do.
I'm out of the group.
What?
Shirley.
Shirley, please.
Oh, Shirley, don't go, please.
Uh-oh.
Sassy black schmitty's out of the group.
Oh, no, not the group.
Poor, sad, little schmitties.
Can't all of us little schmitties get along?
Would you please hurry up?
I am late for my bikini wax.
Hurry, please.
Who was that?
A punk-ass who needs to be destroyed.
And I just figured out how.
Can we focus on what's important here?
Shirley thinks we don't care about her.
No, no, you're right.
You're right.
That's totally more important.
I just thought of one thing.
You need to bang that kid's mom.
Um, after we fix everything with Shirley.
Whoa!
Yes, yes, yes, we'll deal with Shirley.
But that's brilliant!
I know because then anything he says about you He'll be saying to a dude that banged his mom.
Oh, my God, you guys.
Sorry, Shirley.
Shirley.
Okay.
Yes!
All right, bye, everybody.
Have a great day.
Be right here at 3:00, please.
I'll be in a hurry.
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.
You don't happen to have an extra bottle of sports drink, do you?
Actually, I do, here you go.
Oh, thanks, got to hydrate, right?
But obviously you know.
You work out.
Well, I try to keep things where they should be.
I think I might be where should I be.
I don't know about your robot, Abed.
Boobatron's great.
Once someone spills bong water on his circuitry and he comes alive, he's gonna make us the coolest guys on campus, help us get babes.
Those are real babes who will really laugh at us.
Hey, you're my friend, right?
Friends are supposed to help each other no matter what.
Okay.
Ridiculous situation descending into heavy-handed drama for the illusion of story, check.
What?
That was awesome.
All right, I am back in.
Cool.
All right.
Just so you know, I'm Shirley.
Wouldn't want you reaching for me should you get a hankering for pancakes.
I'm old and I do not see well.
And you already won, so shut it.
I won?
Oh, no, they want you in the group.
I quit.
So you go ahead, hang with them.
No, thanks, I'm sick of the way that group treats me.
Preaching to the choir.
Tell you what I'm not gonna miss.
Abed and Troy's silly games.
Grow up already.
Ha.
By the way, thanks for including me.
Please.
You think Annie and Britta invite me when they take those weekend trips to the mall?
They just think of me as some sort of mom.
They need to learn manners.
Annie needs to stop dating Vaughn.
He's cute, but he's not the boy I envisioned her ending up with.
No matter how hard you try, you can never be as cool or funny as they are.
It's called respect and no one ever gave me diddly.
Except me.
I respect you more than anyone else in the group.
Which is why you pantsed me?
Well, but you see, that wasn't wrong.
Oh, for heaven's sake, you are such an arrogant, self-righteous ass.
And you are a strong, dignified woman who's raising a family.
A bigger accomplishment than anybody else in that room.
And nobody can ever strip you of that, not even me.
You really believe that?
Yes.
And that's why you think pantsing me wasn't wrong?
It wasn't.
What are you doing?
!
Did I misread that?
Oh, here, let me just do that.
You sure you don't want some vodka?
Oh, I'm good, I'm good.
I'm at school at 2:00 p.m. Did someone just take a schmitty?
Hey, looks like you'll be calling somebody daddy soon.
Or at least your mom will be tonight.
Dude, you are so pathetic.
Mark!
Mom, I've been pwning this loser.
He thinks he can get back at me through you.
What?
Pwning?
Pwning.
He doesn't even know what that means?
Heh, heh.
I see what's going on here.
Look, I don't want to come between a son and his beautiful, vivacious mom.
Oh, my God, you are pathetic.
Yeah, so is the whore in on it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I gotta tell you, Chantel, you have raised a terrible human being.
We're better than this.
No, you're not.
I raised a winner who will continue to crush junior college losers like you.
Oh, schmitty.
Schmitty!
I'm sorry, it's a matter of pride.
What are you looking at?
"What are you looking at"?
Duh!
"What are you looking at"?
Duh.
Duh!
Ha, ha.
School his ass, Mark.
"School his ass, Mark".
Duh.
Ah, leh, leh, leh.
Duh.
Duh, duh, duh!
Duh.
Duh, duh, duh.
Why are Jeff and Britta making fun of those handicapped kids?
They don't even realize how much they need us.
Why are they doing this?
I don't know if you've noticed, but Jeff and Britta have the two most fragile egos of the group.
Losing to these kids will pretty much destroy them.
Hey!
Whoa!
What are you, a priest?
What are you doing?
What the hell?
Hey, you didn't say, "Duh".
We win.
No.
You're the schmitties!
No, no, we're minors.
Yeah.
I'm calling the cops.
No, you're not.
You have already embarrassed me by getting pwned.
Don't be such a girl, now go.
Yeah, see that.
Yes, suck it!
Schmitty face!
We showed you, high schoolers!
Suck it!
Congratulations on your victory.
Thank you, Annie.
Yeah, thank you.
And thanks, you guys.
Any time.
Look, Pierce and I are considering rejoining the group.
And maybe we can all be a little more mature.
I hear that.
Abed, I've had enough of this list.
Doing this stuff isn't fun.
It feels forced.
Fine, I'll deactivate Boobatron.
Trust me, classic college experiences never happen organically.
Food fight!
Food fight!
Oh, no.
Are you sure it's the name of my grade school and my favorite soft drink?
Yup, pretty sure.
George Washington Lemon Fresco.
That's a horrible porn name.
I don't make the rules.
What's yours?
Henry David Thoreau Diet Squirt.
Oh, that's good.
Hello, Henry David Thoreau Diet Squirt.
How many pornos have you been in?
Six thousand and 12.
How many pornos have you been in?
Two thousand and 19.
It's my first week.
Impressive.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Someone here order a pizza?
Is it you guys?
It has extra sausage.
No.
It's big and hot.
That's my pizza.
But you took longer than 30 minutes so I'm not paying.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Raisins don't belong in a chocolate chip cookie.
It gives them depth.
Hey, watch it, punk.
What are you, 80?
He's trying to bring back disco.
I don't have to be old to know it's not gonna happen.
What it is, soul brother.
My boys are gonna make me breakfast in bed for Mother's Day.
I'm gonna make breakfast and get in bed, but they're gonna bring it to me.
Aw.
Aw.
I know.
They said the cutest thing last night.
They said, "Mama," they call me Mama You're gonna be the fun police.
If I'm the fun police, then you're director of Funland Security.
Good, more of this.
More of what?
What do you think?
The constant bickering.
It was cute at first, but Well, Abed explains it best.
Jeff and Britta is no Ross and Rachel.
Your sexual tension, lack of chemistry are putting us on edge, ironically, on every level, you're keeping us from being friends.
Jeff and I do not have sexual tension.
We just argue all the time.
Oh, just like Sam and Diane.
I hated Sam and Diane.
Who are Sam and Diane?
Okay, we get it.
You're young.
Sorry.
See what you're doing to us?
Want my advice?
Pork her and move on.
We did it all the time in my day.
Yeah, you also put hydrogen in blimps, that was bad.
Hey, everybody.
Just a reminder.
Our Spring Fling is on the quad today.
Music, food, activities.
What, what?
He makes me uncomfortable.
Still in the room.
There's also going to be a game of Paintball Assassin with a prize for last man standing.
Or last man in a wheelchair with no paint.
Or last woman.
Give it a rest, Britta.
What's the prize?
It was a Blu-ray DVD player, but it was stolen.
So now it's TBD.
I want TBD.
Is that new?
If it's what I think, I had it in the '70s.
Let's get back to Britta and Jeff.
There's no Britta and Jeff.
He said, fully erect.
I'm gonna let you guys figure this out while I go take a nap in my car.
What are you waiting for?
What the hell?
Hello?
What is going on?
The paintball game was starting, and the dean The dean announced the prize.
The prize.
We turned on each other like animals.
What was the prize?
Was?
This is not over.
This is still happening right now.
Leonard?
Leonard, I'm not playing.
Everyone's playing.
Aw.
You suck.
Come with me if you don't want paint on your clothes.
Hey.
Look what I found wandering the neutral zone.
Jeff Winger.
You son of a bitch.
I thought you were dead, man.
I was just taking a nap.
Has everyone lost their mind?
It's just a game of paintball.
Yeah.
With one rule.
Last man standing gets the prize.
The prize.
The prize.
What is this prize?
You don't know.
Priority registration.
Priority registration?
That's why everyone's running around like a bunch Does that mean what I think?
Like you could have first choice of your classes next semester?
Easy, sugar bear.
But you could schedule all your classes on a Monday and take a six-day weekend.
You could do a lot of things.
Talk him through the hunger.
Every student wants that prize, Jeff.
No way to share it, so we'll all turn on each other.
But the longer we wait to do that Jeff.
The longer we work together, the longer we last.
Everyone running in packs?
Debate team was first, they fell to infighting.
The glee club is luring stragglers into sniper traps with cheery renditions of songs.
Really?
And people fall for that?
Yeah.
I mean, I'm all for winning, but let's not resort to cheap ploys.
Are the girls in the game?
Britta?
No, I don't mean Britta.
Did I say Britta?
Twice now.
Chess Club.
No, no, no.
He's a pawn.
Checkmate, bitches.
And tell the drama club their tears will be real today.
No, that's all sugar, man.
Get some protein.
Right here.
Peanuts.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Peanuts, peanuts.
No, take the stuff out closer to you.
No, no.
The ones in the back are the freshest.
That will keep us going.
Yeah.
Hey.
What the hell?
I got you covered, bro.
You guys formed an alliance without me?
Yeah.
You with Star-Burns?
Not if I can be with you.
It's just Star-Burns.
Anyone else need a pee break?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
I'll stand guard.
I don't need to pee.
I'm wearing a diaper for the game.
Oh, yeah.
For the game.
Hey, guys, make this quick before Pierce's chewing attracts enemies.
Um, guys?
Hold it.
Don't move.
Drop it.
All right, everybody, be cool.
We can beat the others if we merge.
We're doing fine.
You win the game camped on a crapper?
Worked on you.
Did it?
You have a gun in your face?
Matches yours.
Nice comeback.
Shut up.
Jeez.
Jeez.
Okay.
So the agreement is we're allies until we're sure we're the last seven standing.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Mm-hm.
Our team's walking with God.
I'm thinking we might already be the only seven left, in which case, this is a window for the two of us to take out the others.
Real nice, Troy, that'd be great PR for the black students.
I am not an ambassador.
I am gladiator.
Now, you want to win or not?
Oh!
Troy made God mad.
Take cover.
Run, Pierce.
Glee club.
How do you know it's the glee club?
Listen.
# Hit me with your best shot ## Oh, brother.
That is so uninspired.
I'm not so sure.
I got a plan.
Get ready.
Hey, Pierce.
Don't come over here, okay?
Screw you.
I'm coming over there.
Medic.
In the trees.
There.
Write some original songs.
What are you gonna do if you win priority registration?
I'll make my schedule airtight.
Maybe get out of here in 3 years instead of 4.
I'd take any class with no tests and no papers.
What would you do, Shirley?
I'd choose all morning classes so I could get home early to spend some time with my boys.
It's hard being away from them so much.
You know what?
I say if any of us win, we give it to Shirley as a Mother's Day gift.
Absolutely.
What?
Abed, you don't have to do that.
I am so sick of you guilting people with your phony humanitarian shtick.
Phony?
When I win, you can watch me do it.
Of course, but that won't make it less phony.
You'd be a lot more likeable If I never did anything for anybody?
Yeah.
Because when you help people, that always turns out great.
Let's do it.
Shh.
Study group.
Come out and play.
Oh, look, it's post-ironic Disco Stu.
You still trying to bring it back?
Hi.
Damn, he brought it back.
Put your hands in the air.
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
They shot us.
It's hot, it's hot.
Let's go, fool.
The last guy almost got me.
My legs.
Oh, Shirley, I'm so sorry.
I'm going home, Britta.
I know, Shirley, I know.
No, seriously, I'm going home.
Can you help me up?
Oh.
Yeah, sure.
Shirley, I'm gonna win for you and your boys.
That's nice.
Shirley, I'm gonna win that prize, but not for you and your boys.
That's less nice.
Oh, my God, you've been hit.
What?
Oh, no.
Wait, wait.
It's blood.
I thought it was paint, but I'm just bleeding.
Talk about luck.
I can't believe this game is still going on.
It's 2 a.m. What if someone gets hurt and the police come?
They'll think I'm a bad dean.
There's classes in the morning.
This has to stop.
Shh.
Put me in the game, because I'll take everyone out.
I play paintball three times a week, bro.
I'm one of the douches who brings his own equipment.
But it wouldn't be fair.
You're not a student.
But you can change that, can't you?
Huh?
Enroll me in a class.
What are your interests?
Arts and crafts.
Oh, I do watercolors.
Oh, cool.
The group would be thrilled.
The wounded soldier fantasy means we're moments from doing it, right?
Yeah, can you feel that tension?
It's a miracle we still have clothes on.
You're right, you know.
I am a phony.
I try to act compassionate, because I'm afraid that I'm not.
Oh, please, I invented phony.
You care about people.
I accuse you of faking to convince myself I'm not such a jerk.
Jeff, you help people more than I do, and you don't even want to.
You're not a jerk.
You're fine.
Especially now that I've repaired your overworked torso with my trembling feminine fingers.
Yes.
Too much sexual tension.
Damn bursting.
It would totally serve them right if we did it here in the study room.
God, could you imagine?
I can't stop imagining.
Neither can I. We should get dressed before the third-shift librarian shows up.
Yeah, we don't want this to turn into a letter to Penthouse, right?
I think the group is right.
We did need to relieve some tension.
Tell me you didn't have sex with me to win at paintball.
No, I had sex with you, and I'm gonna win at paintball.
Don't be gross.
I'm gross?
You seem pretty practiced at putting on panties one-handed while holding a gun.
Can I get dressed before you assassinate me?
So all that happened, it meant nothing to you?
I didn't say that.
What did it mean to you?
I asked you first.
Very mature.
Said the woman wearing Hello Kitty.
Said the woman holding the gun.
You sure that's a gun?
Because maybe it's a metaphor for your fake, jaded persona.
Uh-oh.
No paintballs, Hans?
What do you think, I'm stupid?
When'd you take it?
When you started seducing.
I wasn't though.
Assuming that makes you way grosser.
Not when I'm right.
Buenos dias, children.
You'll be happy to know you made it till the end.
You're not even a student.
Wrong.
Critical Media Literacy and Politics of Gender, biatch.
Give me your clip.
Oh, that would be brilliant of me.
Look, you got the drop on me.
I lost.
Let me do this for you.
Be pretty crazy if I shot you right now, huh?
What's so funny, Chang?
Maybe it's the fact there's no such thing as priority registration.
Or maybe it's this.
Ta-da.
Dean.
Just one moment.
Oh, hi there, Jeffrey.
That's a good look for you.
Everybody out there is shooting each other for nothing while you sit here in your ivory tower.
Jeffrey, I can explain.
I messed up when I promised priority registration.
It's a violation of some student equality act, but this isn't.
Ta-da!
Okay, now, it's not Blu-ray, but it comes with its own remote, so Jeffrey.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey.
You get it all out of your system?
Almost.
What do you want from me, Jeffrey?
Guess.
Oh, hi.
Hey, how's it going?
You still have some paint.
Oh, thanks.
Um, I was thinking You don't have to.
It didn't happen.
It's not a mistake.
It didn't happen.
It was a crazy night of paintball.
Exactly.
Tension relieving.
Absolutely.
No need to mention it to anyone.
Right, no big deal.
Nothing's changed.
Something's changed.
Oh, Abed.
Crazy Abed.
No, something's different now.
Could be me.
Sporting a man-thong.
Maybe.
Or maybe it's that I have emerged victorious with a priority registration form.
Well done, Jeff.
And in recognition of her bravery, not to mention her children, I hereby award this to the best soldier, Shirley.
Now, the bad news is, for legal purposes, next semester, if anybody asks, you have gout.
Do you mind walking with a limp?
Mm.
Thank you, Jeffrey.
Look, Annie.
Wow, I didn't see that coming.
Neither did I. So no one feels it?
No one senses anything's different?
Nope.
Not at all.
It's riding up a little.
Hey, Abed, it's Troy.
I'll meet you at the flagpole in If you are satisfied with your message, press one.

Yo, I'll meet you at the flagpole in like If you are satisfied with your message Hey, Abed.

Goodbye.

Troy will meet you at the flagpole in 10 minutes.
Okay.
If you are satisfied Maybe just send a text message.
Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
It's hard to believe , but finals are here.
And I know that during this stressful time, my voice blaring over a PA can't help.
Which is why, for the next three days, you'll hear nothing but soothing sounds of nature.
And to kick it off, here's a babbling brook.
Will anyone back me up if I say this is ridiculous, or is it gonna be another Avatar situation?
I love Avatar.
What's an avatar?
Okay.
Nature sounds or not, we're not gonna have trouble passing our Spanish final.
I've transcribed this semester's notes from my digital recorder.
You record every class?
Pfft.
Spoiler alert.
You mean nerd alert.
Alert nerd.
Here's a spoiler.
We're all gonna spend the next three days boning up.
Then pass the exam and move on to Spanish 103.
Sounds like a good ending, Annie.
Except for where I take Spanish 103.
What do you mean?
Spanish 102 fills my language requirement.
I guess I just figured we're a Spanish study group, so we'd keep taking Spanish together.
That's what I thought too, Annie.
I'm in.
I'm on a tight, four-year schedule to replace my bachelor's.
I'm not gonna take an extra class.
Spanish has value beyond credit.
Not really.
I know the family downstairs hates me.
I don't need to understand why.
Okay, fine.
You want me to say it?
I'll say it.
I like this group.
I want it to stay together.
Oh, I think so too.
Yeah, I like this group.
Yeah, you be the cool guy, Jeff.
And next fall when that gets lonely, I'll be in the front row of Spanish 103.
Monday through Friday, Six And now, crickets.
Okay, if we're not interested in Spanish 103 next year, what about Anthropology?
Ooh.
Anthropology, the study of man.
I'm still trying to forget what I learned about that subject.
Hee, hee.
Go, girl.
You just go-girled yourself.
Shut up.
See, it's fun.
And they have a class at noon.
Noon, everybody.
Anthropology?
Anthropology?
Anthropology?
Annie, I'm not big on planning ahead, but I have one unmovable appointment May 23rd, 2013.
To buy a flying car?
I have a table for one at Morty's Steakhouse where I will celebrate becoming a lawyer again which can only happen if I take a full load.
Don't.
A full load of classes every year, I can maybe make it until then.
But not by building my schedule around BFFs.
We'll build ours around yours.
Annie, you realize we'll be friends whether or not we have a class together, right?
Of course you think that.
Obvious from your name your parents smoked pot.
All right, well, I haven't said a single word in this entire conversation and I find that outrageous.
Hola, el losers.
Winger, may I have a word with you in private?
Sure.
Good.
Sorry.
Oh.
Got it.
Got it.
Cool.
Okay, come back in 10 minutes.
And if anyone asks, I sent you to learn things.
And, Pierce, close the door, please.
Other side of the door.
So you're here because your college degree was fake, right?
I prefer the term better than real, but yes.
Two questions.
Where did you get it?
Could you have prevented being caught, and how?
One question.
Where did you learn to count questions?
Are you telling me you need a fake degree?
You know, in high school, I was in a band.
We could've been huge, but the world wasn't ready for an Asian man on keytar.
Did you say "keytar" or did you just pronounce guitar like a hillbilly?
Keytar.
It's a keyboard you can play like a guitar.
Oh.
Get with the times, man.
Anyway, next thing you know, I'm 32, and I'm bagging groceries for, like, 5 bucks an hour plus tips.
Shocked?
Confused.
I'm supposed to tip my bag boy?
So I did what anyone would do.
I faked my way into a job as a Spanish teacher at a community college, relying on phrases from Sesame Street.
Oh, my God.
Save the judgment, Winger, all right?
If the dean finds out that I'm not a real teacher, your grades are invalid, and you'll all have to repeat this class.
That was the chair.
Good.
Good.
It's unsolvable.
Hold on.
I forgot my Hey.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey.
Hey, come back here.
Come back here.
Jerry.
Hey, Jerry, check this out.
And that is what Milton was really saying.
Okay, exams are on Tuesday.
Class dismissed.
If the dean finds out that I'm not a real teacher, your grades are invalid, and you'll all have to repeat this class.
If the dean finds out that I'm not a real teacher, your grades are invalid, and you'll all have to repeat this class.
That was the chair.
Right.
Hi, everybody.
Hi.
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you, kids.
Well, it's actually bad news for the older people as well.
Señor Chang is no longer with us.
Um.
He's not faking his death again, is he?
Because I can't handle that.
First, he's alive.
Then we're happy.
And then he's alive again and I received an anonymous tip that Chang had misrepresented certain aspects of his qualifications.
For instance, having them.
Word of advice, if an Asian man says he's a Spanish teacher, it's not racist to ask for proof, okay?
You ignore your mother's voice and get right into that horse's mouth.
So if Chang's a fraud, what about our grades?
Are they invalid?
Oh, no, no, no.
That's not fair to you guys.
I'm sure you've all worked very hard and learned.
So just take your final with Chang's replacement.
Doctor.
Sí.
Buenos días.
Sí.
Listen to this back and forth.
It's like I'm at an embassy.
What's on the final?
I know it's in Spanish, dummy.
What chapters?
All three or?
Veinte.
Oh, I know that one.
She wants a large coffee.
Oh.
She's thinking.
Okay, in English.
You will be taking a standard exam for students at your level.
It will cover this entire textbook.
El crappo.
I couldn't understand a word Dr. Escodera was saying.
And why is she teaching Spanish if she's a doctor?
Go cure something.
I gotta pass that exam or my entire four-year plan will be thrown off.
That might be your car, Jeff.
What?
My route for the 4th of July, fireworks set off the car alarms.
That one sounded like a new Lexus.
My Lexus isn't brand-new.
I know.
Yours is a 2002.
That's the year I heard it.
Hey.
You two-faced jag.
You're wearing protective goggles to destroy my car?
Safety first.
Stop.
I ask you for help and you turn me in?
What?
I did not.
Why would I screw myself?
What am I, Dr. Drew?
I didn't do it, okay?
Then tell me who did it so I can murder your face.
Hey, break it up.
Oh.
Oh, oh.
We're writing a song.
For the battle of bands.
Good luck passing your exam, Winger.
At one point, I was teaching you Klingon.
Yeah?
Why don't you tell that to your really weird-sounding magical chair.
I have a condition.
I'm peeing.
I'm peeing.
I'm peeing.
Impressive.
I dismantled that valve and I put out that free cake because I wanted to see what you could do.
You got a gift, kid.
You know that, right?
A gift for sinks.
Big deal.
I'm a student.
I like learning.
Yeah, right.
Learning.
Learn everything.
Learn until you're dead.
Or you can call this number.
Now, that's a company that fixes toilets and sinks.
Oh, man.
Listen to me.
Toilets and sinks, real things, things that people always use and always need to get fixed.
This is a life, kid, a real one.
Doing something that matters, something that makes sense.
The only thing that makes sense is this.
Learning, thoughts.
So I can think, and get a student loan, and grind my own coffee, and understand HBO.
You don't have to do that, kid.
You're special.
You could be a plumber.
You could be a plumber.
Hey.
Hi.
Okay, so we know three kinds of verbs, which took 40 minutes.
At this rate, if we don't sleep or pee, we can cover about 10 percent of the exam.
If it's multiple choice, Actually, that's a lot of right answers when you're guessing almost everything.
I don't wanna sound like a defeatist, but we're defeated.
Oh, come on, Jeff.
Face it.
Why even take the exam?
We're all gonna be retaking Spanish this fall.
What was that?
What was what?
I don't know.
I said retake Spanish and everyone went, "Ugh".
And you went, "Hmm".
It's one of those recessive genes.
I can also curl my tongue.
Who else?
Annie ratted out Chang.
What?
You made this happen because you're obsessed with all of us being together next year.
I wouldn't say I was obsessed.
Permission to treat witness hostile?
I'll allow it.
Did you record yesterday's Spanish class?
I don't think so.
Abed?
You said you record all your classes.
Pierce called it a spoiler alert.
You heard Chang tell me he was bogus.
And then dropped the dime because you would do anything to keep this group together, because you are insecure.
Because you didn't get hot until after high school.
That's true.
Fine.
I did it.
For real, Annie?
Oh, Annie.
Make her a dude so I can punch her.
Go ahead and hate me.
We were all gonna drift apart.
You were all too cool to do anything.
Maybe not too cool, maybe just, you know, not psycho enough.
Yeah, a little crazy.
A little psycho.
Now she is going to make the Disney face.
Her lip is gonna quiver and her eyes will flutter, but they won't ever actually close.
But do not feel sorry for her.
She stole a year of our lives, and we're right to be pissed.
Oh, Annie.
No.
No.
Everyone close their eyes.
Do it.
Close them.
Abed, close.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I can only connect with people through movies.
She's the Ark of the Covenant.
You guys, I'm sorry.
I only did it so that we could stay friends.
Picture her as Paul Giamatti.
I mean, he's Heh.
Friends don't do what you did to us.
Did the sisterhood of the traveling pants poison each other's food so they were too sick to leave?
No.
I've never seen it, but I'm pretty sure they mailed each other pants.
I said I was sorry.
Who cares if you're sorry?
We're still screwed.
Be sorry about this stuff before you do it.
Then don't do it.
It's called growing up.
We were gonna see each other all the time.
Yeah, that's what my rehab group used to say.
The only one that keeps in touch is the guy that sells jewelry made out of bottle caps.
I had hoped that this group would amount to more than passing hellos and whatever the hell this is.
Nobody even think about going after her.
That's what she wants, more personal drama so we fail the exam and stay in Spanish forever.
We have to beat her.
Don't text her.
Don't call her.
Don't mention her.
We do not need her to study.
Does anybody know how to study?
Annie usually Whose side are you on?
Happy finals week, Greendale.
Continuing our stress-reducing nature sounds, that's cut five from Sounds of the Serengeti.
Here's a B-side from that album, "Antelope Slaughter at Ndutu".
Oh, God.
Did we miss the exam?
No, it starts in 40 minutes.
I can't wake up Pierce.
Is this gonna take an unexpected turn?
You have to know how to do it.
Discrimination lawsuit.
Preposterous.
Should we call Annie?
Absolutely not.
Keep your eyes on the prize and let her grow up.
I'll see you all at the exam.
Wait for me, Britta.
I was with you in the bathroom.
You're with me everywhere.
Troy, I know you could be a plumber.
I'm not gonna be, okay?
I'm gonna be sophisticated and have no job, or a job that looks from a distance like I do nothing.
Troy, you know what the best part of my day is?
Ten seconds from the time I sit in Spanish to the time I look at your desk.
Because I think maybe I'll look and he won't be there.
Between our studying for 12 hours, and Pierce being asleep for 11, I think we may actually stand a chance.
My horoscope predicted suffering.
No, no, that's good.
Horoscopes are the devil trying to trick us.
Mm-hm.
Oh.
Yeah.
That make you happy?
Why aren't you at your desk?
Because I don't wanna sit near you because you're a bad friend.
He said the best part of his day is when he thinks I won't be there.
Abed, what a terrible thing to say.
It's from a movie.
Then the movie it's from is terrible.
Where's Annie?
Oh, I sent her a text, but she hasn't responded yet.
Shirley, what did I tell you?
Don't play into her ploy for attention.
What does it say?
She says she's fine and this isn't a ploy for attention.
She's sorry.
She does need to grow up, starting by making things right with Chang.
Oh, no.
What?
He'll kill her.
Who cares about a stupid exam?
We're a study group.
And Annie's our friend.
I'm friends with Hannah too.
The whole class is.
And you can't have an exam without a class.
Right, guys?
We love Hannah.
We love Hannah.
We love Hannah.
We love Hannah.
No!
No!
Oh, no.
The devil told the truth.
Okay.
Whoa.
Winger, what the hell?
What was that screaming?
I was showing Annie the magic of electronic sampling.
We thought you were murdering her.
Annie getting me fired was the best thing that ever happened to me.
She's helping me re-plan my life.
She's got a real mind for stuff like this.
We're gonna find Ben a job so he can stay at Greendale as a student and work on his teaching degree.
And music classes, you know?
Maybe get the band back together, huh?
Oh.
Listen to that.
Yeah.
Music lessons would be great for you.
Oh, thanks, Britta.
Now, go pass that test.
Heh, heh, heh.
Well, it was kind of easy, right?
Yeah, I think I might have passed.
Jeff, I can never forgive myself for what I did.
Look, I treated you like a child for having feelings.
Maybe because that's, you know, when I stopped having them.
But you shouldn't.
You don't have to be a kid to admit that you like people.
And you don't have to dress like this to grow up.
You look like a travel agent.
You don't like it?
I was going for more of a professor thing.
What?
Why?
What?
Nothing.
I think I got half of it, which got me through the half I didn't.
Like the first season of The Wire.
Exactly the Ah, hell, I can't stay mad at you.
I think I nailed it.
Oh, me too.
I'm feeling pretty confident.
I think we're gonna make it.
Still, we should plan for the worst-case scenario.
Because if we do all pass, that means next year, we won't have a class together.
So we're gonna need a backup.
Anthropology?
Anthropology?
Anthropology?
Anthropology?
Heh, heh, heh.
Anthropology.
Anthropology.
I want you to be in my next film.
"Barnes, Troy: 68".
Bennett, Shirley: 81.
Edison, Annie: 95.
Hawthorne, Pierce: 70.
Nadir, Abed: 85.
Perry, Britta: 79.
"Winger, Jeff" I'm sorry, Jeff.
I'm sorry for the half-hearted mislead, 80.
We all pass Spanish.
That's nice.
Not to take anything away from anyone, but didn't the test seem extra easy?
I don't know.
Uh-uh.
Hey, thanks for making it easy.
I was going to say the same to you, but you were gone before breakfast.
I'm an early riser.
I'll say.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Thanks for a great year.
You got it.
Mr. Winger.
I hope you will be seizing the day this summer.
Thanks, Professor Whitman.
And I hope you'll be seizing a more contemporary movie.
Looking good, Leonard.
Stroke or tai chi?
Tai chi.
Keep it up.
And keep up whatever it is you're doing, Garrett.
It's called chillaxing.
Duh.
Hey-hey, what's up, Jeff?
Hi.
Hello, good morning, howdy.
Ha-ha-ha.
Wait, Jeff.
I'll walk with you.
I'll see you.
Okay.
Uh, I got class in, like, five hours, so All right, I'll see you, babe.
I can't believe I made it through my first year of college.
I finally get to click send on so many l-told-you-so e-mails.
Yeah, it's pretty great.
Not much could ruin today.
Hi.
Oh, shoot.
I forgot saying that summons him.
Will you two be attending tomorrow's, uh, transfer ceremony to send off all the students leaving for so-called real schools?
There's a formal dance afterward.
How many dances this school have?
Five.
If you come to all of them, you get one of these.
I assumed your whole posse would be coming to the dance, having heard the exciting news about Britta.
Banana rhino.
Yeah, ugh Banana Sam Elliott.
Oh-ho-ho.
LeVar Banana Burton.
Ha-ha-ha.
Banana King Tut.
Here, give me that.
It's more like this.
Banana penis.
Ha-ha-ha.
Sure you would've loved it if he did it.
What?
What's happened to you and me, Troy?
Remember how hard we laughed when we first heard the term teacher's aids?
Yeah.
And then we found out a teacher did have AIDS.
So, what's everybody doing this summer?
I'm taking the boys on a trip.
Money's tight, I hope I can convince them for one more year that motels are tiny little theme parks.
Yeah, I got to find a new place to live.
My dad wants me to leave the nest so he feels less weird that his girlfriend's 20.
You could live in a pyramid.
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, wait.
Abed.
Your dorm got a bunk bed, right?
Yep.
Um Everyone has to go to the transfer dance tomorrow.
I'm going.
My friend Gary's transferring.
Oh, good.
Finally.
Thank God.
Hope he transfers to hell.
More importantly, our very own Britta Perry, it turns out, has been nominated for transfer queen.
Oh, that's nice.
What the hell is a transfer queen?
Like prom queen.
You wear a sash.
There's a vote, and if you win they put a crown on your head.
And I am so jealous, I want to murder you.
Aren't you excited?
No.
How did I get nominated?
Don't let it upset you, Britta.
It's the last day of semester.
Nothing can ruin that.
Hi.
Amazing.
He's like an evil genie.
Just spreading the news.
Some folks say "transfer formal" isn't really rolling off the tongue, so we're just gonna call it the "tranny dance".
Much more Greendale.
What kind of community college has a prom?
Proms weren't even cool in high school.
It's that kind of crap that made me drop out in the first place.
You know, you don't actually have to lie on a sofa like it's a Woody Allen movie.
Thank you for telling me that in the last session, dumbass.
Now, look, there are bugs on the windshield of your mind, you may never be able to squeegee like a certain birthday party attended by a rather enterprising transient in a dinosaur costume.
But there are other more recent streaks that you might yet be able to wipe clear, like your adolescent fear of being a so-called blow-up doll.
I really think this nomination may actually help that.
So you think I'd feel better about myself if I sexed up, went over there, and really tried to be crowned queen of the dingbats?
Precisely.
Wow.
Guess you really get what you pay for with free therapy.
Ouch.
That stung a little bit.
Thanks.
Ugh.
I'll save you time.
He listens to you talk for a year, then recommends a makeover.
Well, don't wear as much lipstick as you did on Valentine's Day.
Your mouth looked like a coin purse.
Señor Chang, Greendale's foremost, if only, Spanish teacher.
What can I do for you?
I am actually a student now.
But I was thinking, as a teacher, and as my friend, um, if you could help me cheat my way through school.
I have a counterproposal.
How about I point out to you we've never actually been friends, then laugh at your very well-deserved misfortune?
Let's just try that a second.
Ahem.
No, Jorge, you killed it.
Are you going to Abed's kegger?
Heck, yeah.
You know it, jefe.
Sweet.
You probably don't wanna talk to me.
It's not junior high.
We're mature adults, Michelle.
We can talk.
I think I handled our breakup poorly.
Before I respond to that I'll have to take an extra-strength vitamin duh.
Duh.
We started getting serious and I got scared, it's possible I made a mistake.
Maybe we can talk about it sometime.
I miss you.
Mm-mm.
Why don't you take a picture.
It will last longer.
Cool.
Dope kegger.
Thanks.
Funny.
You know, I spend so much time here, I forget that we don't live together.
Then I think, "What if we lived together"?
Here, I'm gonna check on the other keg.
Hey, Troy, you ever seen one of these?
It's called a beer bong.
You're not supposed to inhale though.
I almost died outside.
Why does Abed hate me?
What, are you kidding?
Look at him.
He probably hates America.
Hey, babe.
Baby, guess what.
Your boyfriend just got offered a spot on the number one community college Hacky Sack team in the nation.
Oh, my God, sweetie.
I'm assuming that's huge.
Of course it's huge.
Are you kidding me?
I mean, you know.
I'm not into fame and stuff, but I could be the next Vngwe Mackadangdang, Jr. I know.
There's one thing, mountain flower, that's that the, uh, school's in Delaware.
Thank you.
You know, if you don't go to this dance tomorrow, we are not gonna see each other for months.
It's not a Jane Austen novel.
We have cell phones.
What?
Aah Oh.
Oh, jeez, sorry.
What are you doing?
You had hair I was gonna move.
You were gonna move my hair?
I don't know.
Ever thought of yourself as a guarded person, Britta?
Am I?
Watch.
Ow!
See?
It's alarming, right?
Right?
Oh.
Oh, Professor Slater, hi.
What are you doing here?
Oh, you know, end of the year, randomly wandering.
Hi, Jeff.
Are you two?
No.
No.
The two of you aren't?
No.
No, just friends.
Same here.
Good for you.
Will I see you at the dance, Britta?
Kind of obligated, seeing as I'm nominated for queen, so Oh.
I thought you were all into female empowerment.
What's more empowering than a woman in a crown?
Just did my first keg stand.
Ha-ha.
Can't feel my legs.
Uhn.
# Dancing in your underwear # # Taking air conditioner repair # # So you can get a job # # Greendale's the way it goes ## Whoo!
Ha-ha.
Our original school song by the venerable Pierce Hawthorne.
Ha.
He made that up.
Hmm?
Everyone remember to vote before the coronation.
The nominees are identified with sashes that say, "Tranny Queen".
Ha-ha.
By the way, we do offer summer classes, which are a great way to, um Um Broaden your mind.
Have fun.
Hi.
You're here for me.
Guys.
Guys.
Vaughn got recruited to a college in Delaware.
I'm gonna go with him for the summer.
Finally.
A classic last-day-of-school plot twist.
He's gonna be the next Vngwe Mackadangdang, Jr. It's a Hacky Sack guy.
Hey, you don't have to tell us who Ingmar Mackadingdong, Jr. is.
Hmm.
Jeff, help me with some refreshments.
Please don't tell anyone until after I'm gone.
I'm not just going to Delaware for the summer.
I'm transferring with Vaughn.
What?
When did you decide that?
I spent three months researching backpacks before I chose the one that I use now.
I don't want to be that person anymore.
I want to live in the moment.
Well, for your and Vaughn's sake, I hope it works out.
But on behalf of the rest of the group, I hope it's a catastrophe.
You better visit.
Whoa.
I can't believe nobody's taken this cookie.
Señor Chang, is there a word in Spanish for someone who used to pretend to be a professor but was a teacher, but wasn't actually a teacher, and is now a student?
Is there a word for that?
Oh.
If it was in Spanish, you wouldn't know, would you?
Bup-bup-bup.
Hit a professor, you'll get expelled.
I will find a loophole.
Oh.
Good luck with that.
Then I'll kill you.
Dudley Moore.
Spray tan.
I'd go easy on that punch if I was you.
I've put in a little Hot person, hot people.
The two of them coming this way.
Which one do you want?
Hi, Jeff.
Hi, Jeff.
Oh.
Ha-ha.
Oh.
Britta, you look great, such a stunning improvement.
Wow, you look gorgeous.
It must've taken all day.
Oh, Jeff, you've got a Oh.
It's right there.
I do?
What?
Guys, guys, cleanest face ever.
Hey, am I okay?
Yes.
Yeah.
You know, Troy, uh, our study group, after all we've been through, we got to stick together.
You, me, and Jeff and Rain Man, and big boobs and medium boobs and black boobs, we're a family.
What's your point?
I've been looking at your situation, and I'd like to make an offer.
Okay.
Am I black boobs?
Last call.
Study over.
What are you doing?
Just giving things a finale vibe.
Well, how's this for a finale vibe?
Pierce asked me to move in with him, in his mansion.
More of a spin-off vibe, but you should do it.
I thought we were friends.
We are.
Best friends, that's why we shouldn't be roommates.
We'll end up fighting and putting a masking tape line down the middle of our room.
We just won't get masking tape.
Troy.
You should live with someone who you like but whose friendship wouldn't be altered because of constant irritation, that's Pierce.
If you and I move in, we jump the shark.
That will end it.
Maybe you're ending it.
Oh, and for the record, there was an episode of Happy Days, where a guy literally jumped over a shark, and it was the best one.
I think I'm winning.
Winning tranny queen.
Yeah.
So, uh, isn't it nice that Jeff and Slater are getting back together?
What?
Aha.
And psych.
But they will get back together if you don't stop competing with her and start communicating with Jeff.
She already has a head start.
They slept together.
Holy macaroni with pepper jack.
When?
Where?
During paintball in the study room with Colonel Mustard.
Does it matter?
Well, now it does matter.
Where Where in the study room?
On the couches.
We use those.
Oh, get over it.
I've seen you shake the dean's hand.
Who knows where he's been?
Do you believe in soul mates?
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Um, okay.
Now, don't be mad at me.
I didn't think that more than one person would answer the ad.
Yes, dream coming true.
You guys are leaving already?
Yeah.
Got to be in Delaware by tomorrow night.
Hey.
I'll see you soon.
Have a good summer.
I'll see you in the fall, Annie.
Mm.
Heh.
We're gonna miss you.
Yeah.
You're the one that didn't even want me in the study group.
Come on, that's not true.
Yeah, none of us did.
I say things others won't.
That has value.
Well, bye.
See you.
Lates.
Bye.
Take care.
See you later.
Good to know you.
Hang 10.
Good evening, Michelle.
Or may I say, Meow-chelle?
Who has your car keys?
They're in the taco meat.
Now, what say you and I blow this pop stand, and head off for a spot of slap and tickle?
I mean sex, in case the lingo hasn't made it to the States.
I think I'm probably leaving here with Jeff.
Really?
I'm sorry, I just assumed that you two were done, since, uh, ahem, Jeff and Britta did the The yankee doodle.
Oh, don't tell me that didn't make it to the States.
It clearly originated here.
Okay, we finished tallying all Yo, Goldilocks.
Drop the smirk.
I know about your grungy tumble, and I'm sure it was the highlight of your diary but it was during a pit stop in something real.
You were the pit stop.
He used you to numb the pain of not getting with me.
Jeff needs a girl who doesn't just not wear underwear because Oprah told her it would spice things up, he needs a girl who doesn't wear underwear because she hasn't done laundry in three weeks.
He's been to flavor country now.
They should retire the table we did it on.
Table?
Miss Britta Perry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have to go.
I just won a contest for being hot.
Oh, wow.
This is a huge honor.
This may come as a surprise to you, but I've never actually won anything before.
Okay, well, you still haven't.
Uh I'm just listing the nominees, so, not a great time to get cocky.
Okay.
Christine Hollinsworth.
Britney Baker.
Miss Danielle Harman.
Amy Sm Jeff Winger, do not get back with Slater.
I love you.
Psst, psst.
Britta.
Britta.
Your lipstick looks better.
Hey, man.
How's it going?
Uh Don't shoot the messenger but everyone at this dance is kind of waiting for your reaction to all this.
Look, I'm trying to think, okay?
Yeah, that's cool.
Take your time.
Hey, how's it going?
You look great.
Very Fatal Attraction.
Thanks.
Uhn.
What's wrong with you?
I'm sick.
I don't know why.
Have you considered the 60-inch diameter cookie you're eating?
How can something that's delicious make me sick?
Unless too much of a good thing is actually a bad thing.
My friendship with Abed is a giant cookie.
I kinda got my own thing going on now.
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I'm flattered.
Second, have you ever heard of e-mail?
You love me?
Do you love me?
I have something to say.
Jeff, I love you.
I wonder where she got that from.
I'm sorry.
Do you have a patent on loving people?
Would you like a patent in getting your ass kicked?
Ack-uh-duh-buh-dee.
Okay, okay.
Can you stand over there?
And can you sit down, please?
Jeffrey, choose Britta.
Yeah, Team Britta.
Britta's lame.
Team Slater.
Bring Conan back.
It's been, uh, a great year.
Can't hear you.
No one can hear you.
I'm just gonna sneak right up here and give you this, okay?
Uh Hi, it's, uh Oh, come on, who are you choosing?
l I don't know.
Oh.
Come on, Jeffrey.
Everybody close their faces.
All right, he's got a lot on his mind.
Leave him alone.
I got it from here.
My name is Professor lan Duncan, and I would like to rap for you.
No.
Drop a beat.
No, no beat.
Uh-oh.
# My name is lan Duncan And I'm here to say # # I'm going to rap to the beat In a rapping way # # I've got a real big penis And I drink lots of tea ## Okay, okay.
No, no.
You know what, Duncan?
That's enough.
You have a problem.
What?
Why?
Oh.
I have a problem?
Yes.
Who is it here who has a Dalmatian fetish?
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Well, that is an oversimplification, and you are suspended.
Oh, come on.
You're not a teacher anymore.
What's this?
A roll of quarters.
Why?
Funny question.
Friends, help me, friends.
I'll do it.
I'll move in with you.
Fantastic, buddy.
Come over on Saturday?
My tailor will fit you for a uniform.
Pull him out.
Pull him out.
I thought you left.
I couldn't go.
What happened?
I guess as we were driving away, I finally started living in the moment and I realized that, in the moment, Greendale is where I belong.
What are you doing out here?
Oh, you know, Britta and Slater told me they loved me.
Really?
Yeah.
What did you do?
I ran away.
I don't know.
It's hard.
Slater makes me feel like I do when I write my New Year's resolutions.
She makes me feel like the guy I want to be.
And Britta makes me feel like the guy I am three weeks after New Year's, when I'm back to hitting my snooze button and screening Mom's phone calls, back to who I really am.
So do you try to evolve or do you try to know what you are?
I don't know.
I wish I could live two lives.
One of me would go with Vaughn, and one of me could stay here.
Yeah.
One of me be back with Slater, the other could try it with Britta.
And then we could all get together for some weird foursome.
Um, I guess I gotta go deal with it.
Good luck.
Heh.
Um I'm glad you're staying.
Oh, my God.
I'm finally popular enough to be in the yearbook.
What do you mean video yearbook?
Where do I sign?
Photo not available.
This better not be one of those take-your-top-off videos.
I don't believe in yearbooks.
I just want people to remember there's a guy in between these things.
Heh.
What a year.
Only two pregnancy scares.
I give this year a D for delightful.
I can't believe I spent ten bucks on this.
I don't know any of these people.
