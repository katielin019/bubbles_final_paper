{START OF EPISODE 1}
Jen, have a listen to this?
Moss, have you seen the newsletter?
Does this sound mysterious?
Yeah, yeah, it's quite mysterious.
I was hoping for ruddy mysterious.
It's fairly mysterious.
Compiling a playlist for a role-playing game I'm hosting.
Important to get the right atmos.
OK, I don't know what you're talking about.
Kind of like a Dungeons and Dragons thing.
Ew, is this something to do with sex?
Ha!
Far from it, Jen.
No, you see, in role-playing, one person is a dungeon master, or game master, or keeper.
He or she controls the world and tells the players what they're experiencing, whether it's be battling with a coal monster, or just kicking back in a smelly old tavern with some roguish elves.
Played over a few hours, the game employs dice rolls to determine the outcome of certain events.
Now, unlike most board games you might be familiar with, role-playing games often use a 20-sided dice.
- Moss?
- Yeah.
I want to stop listening to this.
I completely understand.
So, in the world we actually live in, a post has opened up for Entertainments Manager.
I could do that.
That sounds great.
Better than whatever this job is.
Entertainments Manager.
It's not for you, Jen.
What are you talking about?
Organising cultural events and visiting business partners, that is so me.
It's not though.
It's really not for you.
Oh, what am I talking to you for?
Where's Roy?
Not in yet.
Is he still moping about after that girl?
Worse than ever.
Thank God he can't play guitar.
Have you seen the pictures?
Pictures?
There's more than one of these?
Yeah, there's a buttload.
And she's Photoshopped out of all of them.
Yeah, it's like someone broke up with Stalin.
It's such a shame.
I've never seen him happier than he's been the last few months.
And now - Oh, hi, Roy!
- Hi, Roy.
It's okay, you're obviously talking about me.
- No, no - It's fine.
I realise I haven't been the easiest person to be around the last few weeks.
But I really feel like I've turned the corner now.
I really do.
So if we can all just carry on as normal My God, oh, my God!
I feel like I've come out the other side of it now.
So, everything's going to be OK from here on in My heart hurts!
You do seem better than yesterday.
But, Roy, you've got to snap out of this.
I know, I know.
Some things just don't work out.
I know you're not used to being in a long-term relationship.
It's really rare for me.
It's so rare.
But take it from me, most of them just don't work out.
She's right, Roy.
- And how would you know?
- I do all right.
When?
Well, if you must know, I met a girl on holiday.
They're always on holiday, aren't they, Moss?
Oh, shut up, Dumpo, the elephant who got dumped!
- Hey, hey!
- Well No, it's okay.
I'm all right.
I mean, I'm still a bit She never said goodbye, so I just kind of It still just hurts just a little bit whenever I think about her.
So.
I guess all I have to do is just never think about her.
Simples!
Oh, she used to love that ad.
It's not for you, Jen.
- What, why not?
- Entertainments Manager?
Do you know what that involves?
Well, from what I can gather, it's just organising cultural events for out-of-town business partners.
That's right.
Yes, yes.
It's not for you.
But as far as I can see, it won't interfere with my duties in the IT department.
And I love culture.
I've seen We Will Rock You four times.
Eurgh Well, Jen, I'd love to help you, but traditionally the role of Entertainments Manager has always been held by a man.
Mr. Reynholm, I don't need to remind you of the report that denounced Reynholm Industries as an institutionally sexist organisation.
Now, you hold on a minute, sugar tits!
Everyone saw through that report.
And I even got that award off those feminists.
The one shaped like the ice-cream fellow.
That's a Shithead Of The Year award.
It actually says it on the base, "Shithead Of The Year".
Did you not read the base?
Oh, God!
Women, eh?
What are they?
Who knows?
Don't do this.
Can't live with them, can't find them sometimes.
What's going on in their little heads?
Don't ask me, I'm not a flippin' women psychiatrist.
But I have learned one or two things from conversations with my mother.
No, no, Moss, please, don't go any further, just stop right there.
You're no good at this kind of thing, Moss.
You'll just make it worse.
Sorry, it's just I've never seen you like this.
I know.
But I'll be fine.
I will.
It's just You can't help with this.
You just can't.
I've got it.
- I've got the job.
- What?
Douglas gave me the job so I'd stop talking.
Jen's Entertainments Manager.
It's not for you, Jen.
Why does everyone keep saying that?
- What happened to Gerry?
- Massive heart attack.
I'm not surprised.
Why are you not surprised?
Why is it not for me?
Gerry was the He was the company Fredo.
You're the new Fredo.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Fredo, from the Godfather.
Who's Fredo again?
Who's he in it?
He's the brother, whose job it is to take out-of-town businessmen and Show them a good time, yeah, that's what I have to do.
I was thinking West End show No, no, Jen, I don't think you understand.
These men are going to expect a lot more than a West End show.
Fredo, Jen, he was, he was sort of a pimp.
Oh, shut up.
- Wasn't he, Moss?
- What?
Fredo, in the film, he was essentially a pimp.
No, he took the ring to Mordor.
Fredo was a pimp.
No, no, that film was the '70s.
Things are different now.
Businessmen are different.
Anyway, enough about our balls.
Gentleman, I'd like you to meet Jen.
No, no, no, Jen's our new Entertainments Manager.
But she's a woman, isn't she?
Jen, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine, Phil.
And two men named John.
- What are you up to, Reynholm?
- Don't you worry, Phil.
Jen may look like an old maid holding pennies in her arse, but she knows the sleaziest routes round this old town I like to call Londinius.
And I'm sure she's planned something suitably raucous for you reprobates.
Oh, yes, yes, I have tickets for a wonderful show in the West End.
As long as it - This thing she's bringing us to.
Oh, God!
I can't read while I'm also trying to see things.
No, no, it's a show, it's a show.
- What happened to Gerry?
- His heart exploded.
Brilliant!
- No, he's quite seriously ill.
- That's classic Gerry.
Gerry wouldn't have brought us it's a show.
Come on, Jen, what type of show?
Well, yes, well it's very raunchy.
Yes, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
Women in it?
Women in it?
Yes, it's an all-woman show.
It's very rude.
- An all-woman show?
- And it's rude.
Eiffel Tower!
I'm so sorry, I really can't apologise enough.
I've never been so embarrassed in my life.
That woman was in EastEnders, how dare you humiliate her?
!
It's not our fault you took us to The Vagina Monologues.
You get there, and it's just women talking.
False advertising.
Look, we're in town for five more days, you better have something proper for us to do.
And the next time you take us to something about talking fannies, it better be about talking fannies.
I know you had good reasons for giving me this award.
I should never have done that interview.
But that journalist had an agenda.
There's more.
"Women are a kind of savage animal, "who men have civilised with their insatiable sexuality".
What don't you like about that?
"Women are essentially no different from radiators".
"I like my women like I like my toast, hot" And consumable with butter.
You don't have to remind me.
I'm all too familiar with my misguided words.
Ladies, listen, no-one can mistake me for Gok Wan.
I've an old-fashioned mindset, but damn it, at least I try.
And Reynholm Industries is changing, ladies, for the better.
The glass ceiling is now a glass floor.
The women are floating above it, and the men are just looking up at them.
So, what do you want from us?
Oh, please take that award back and give it to somebody else.
Mr. Reynholm, I really need to talk to you about something.
Ah, Jen, I'd like you to meet some very special women.
Oh, no, no, no!
What?
Mr. Reynholm, I will not work with prostitutes.
No, no, no, these are feminists.
You can dress it up however you like, they still sleep with men for money.
I'm sorry, no offense.
But I don't charge for these potatoes.
And I don't like women who do.
Don't listen to her!
The bitch is crazy.
Douglas wants me to see out the week.
A whole week in the company of those idiots.
Culture's out, restaurants are out.
Oh, God, this is a nightmare.
Men, eh, what are they like?
With their bawdy talk and rough-housing, and their wandering hands, and breath in the morning.
I'd like to see them have the babies.
What are you getting at, Moss?
Well, unless I'm very much mistaken, this seems to be a problem for which you need the male perspective.
Do you know any men?
You want a good time, right?
One that walks on the wild side without compromising your principles?
Yeah, that's exactly what I want.
Then you got it, baby!
Which is why the game needs a 20-sided dice.
I've not understood a word you've just said.
What is it?
Some sort of computer game?
In a sense, except it uses the most powerful processor known to man.
The human mind.
But you're not playing.
I'm not a player.
But I am playing.
He sort of tells us what's happening.
I will be your guide.
Through my words, you will experience the land of Elfenheart.
From the mighty mountains that border the Goblin Wastelands.
To the sewers that run like a spider web through the city of Jandor.
I, gentlemen, will be your eyes.
I will be everyone you meet, every creature you encounter, every trap you spring.
What about him?
What's this business with the face like a slapped arse?
I'm sorry, I just came out of a long term relationship, so It doesn't She was the greatest woman I've ever met and I'm never going to see her again.
But it's fine, I mean, she never said goodbye.
I'm not going to bore you with it.
See that you bloody don't!
I still don't understand what this game is!
It seems gay.
Are dragons gay, Phil?
Mighty warrior priests wielding golden staffs.
I suppose they're gay too?
Here are your character sheets.
John One, you're a unicorn man.
John Two, you're a wood fairy.
And Phil, you're the Gypsy assassin, Esmerelda.
I'm a woman?
I don't think I want to be a woman.
Just go with it.
It will end.
So, gentlemen, are you prepared to open the doors to your mind and travel to worlds hitherto undreamed of?
Look at those fun bags.
Everybody doing okay, yeah?
You good for drinks?
Loosen up.
It's a role-playing party.
Jen, can I have a word?
I don't think I want to hang with these guys.
Oh, come on, Phil!
These guys are the best.
They're going to do things tonight that'll blow your mind.
Really?
Look at them.
They're young, they're keen.
And all they want to do is show you a good time.
So get back there before you hurt their feelings.
Could I steal the lovely Roy for a sec?
It's just him in all of these.
Oh, thanks, Jen, that was all getting a little bit What do you think you're doing?
What?
Bringing everyone down with your private life.
They don't want to know about your miserable private life.
They're here for a good time.
Look at that face.
Who'd want to role-play with that face?
I'm sorry Jen I just I'm not feeling it tonight.
Then fake it, sweetheart, yeah?
We're getting good money for this.
Don't you want to get the deposit for a flat, leave those bad memories behind?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- I'll try harder, Jen.
- Okay.
Good girl.
Get back there and show those Johns a good time.
Well, that cleaned the pipes.
I've got to thank you, Miranda, for giving me a second chance.
Oh, don't mention it.
Although you do know I don't have the authority to take back the award myself?
Oh, what?
No, we all make mistakes.
And you intrigue me.
Something tells me there's more to you than meets the eye.
Do you mean the rumours that I killed my wife?
No.
- Are there rumours?
- No.
There were rumours that there was a rumour, but that was just bullshit.
I didn't like the way the nominations came from inside your company.
Inside my company?
Yeah, one of the women from the I department faxed a dossier of your behaviour over the last 12 months.
One of the women in the IT department?
Oh, sorry, Phil.
Heal All is probably the worst spell you could have used.
The sound of your low-level magic attracts the attention of the palace guards.
Damn it!
One comes through the door.
Throwing knife.
Are you sure?
Quite a low damage.
I have a plus 40% chance of a critical.
Remember the talking bunny that gave me that magic bracelet?
Yeah, that bunny thing gave him that thing.
You're absolutely right.
Roll 'em.
Yes!
Direct hit.
The knife cleaves his head in twain and some of his brains runneth down John Two's invisibility cloak.
Eiffel Tower!
Unfortunately, he wasn't alone.
Dammit!
'Tis the dreaded Imperial Guard, the cruellest of all of Queen Elisa's troops.
At their head someone you recognise.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the adventurers who have been causing me all this bother.
Lucius Santana!
The very same.
Stand your men down, Lucius!
We have no quarrel with you!
Quarrel?
I just came to see how a mismatched bunch of raggle taggle adventurers bested some of the deadliest criminals in Crackenwood.
That's us!
You have my thanks.
And if you ever want to join the Palace Guard, you know where I am.
The Palace Guard?
You have my sword.
And my staff.
And my bunny bracelet.
And whatever it is that I have.
The mist clears.
You see a lone, female figure.
That's ruddy mysterious.
Hello, Darkharden.
Hello.
Who goes there?
It is I, Queen Elisa Eldridge of the Elves, who cruelly jilted you not three moons ago.
Don't do this.
Just go with it, Roy.
Hello, my queen.
How are you?
I'm fine.
You look well.
So do you Does she?
Yes, she does, actually.
Does she?
So, what are you up to?
Oh, you know just Just keeping busy.
Missing you a little bit.
Yourself?
Usual boring pageantry.
You know how the people of Pippsiehollow love a parade.
What are you doing here?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Bear with me.
Bear with me.
Bear with me.
I sense a sadness in you.
It's just hard.
You know?
I miss you.
I can still smell you on our pillow.
When I close my eyes, it's still your face I see.
It's just hard.
You were here and then you were gone.
What do you want?
It was not easy for me to come here, Darkharden.
But I had one thing I felt I needed to say to you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Brilliant night!
Brilliant!
I can't believe I've never tried role-playing games before.
I'm going to go home and tell the whole rugby club about it.
Roy and Moss did not disappoint?
They did not.
I'd like to see them again.
Thank you, Douglas.
That's one special little lady you've got there.
I'm glad Jerry died.
Eiffel Tower!
Eiffel Tower!
Eiffel Tower!
Eiffel Tower!
Before you go, Jen, I know it was you.
You broke my heart.
You broke my heart!
That's right.
That's right!
Shut up!
Oh, you've cheered up.
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling a lot better now, Jen, thanks.
Thanks to a certain Elfin queen.
What happened to Fredo, in the film?
Ah, oh The Godfather has him killed.
I'm going to go home.
I'm not feeling too good.
Problem solved!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
So, how much are you asking for?
Oh, nothing, just take whatever you want.
I don't want to start cluttering up the place with old stuff, you know?
That's what this new place is about, I want to totally reinvent myself.
From this moment on, everything is going to be different.
Hello, IT, have you tried turning it off and on again?
I did it!
I did it!
I've been accepted!
- No!
- What's going on?
I've been accepted!
I applied and they said yes!
Who said yes?
What are you talking about Moss, you're shaking!
Consonant, please.
B And a vowel, please.
And lastly, A. And here's the Countdown clock.
All right, let's see what we've got.
Jeremy?
Six.
And Maurice?
- And Maurice?
- Nine.
Jeremy, what's your six?
TENAN And Maurice?
It actually already is a word TNETENNBA.
Good heavens, really?
Could you use it in a sentence for us?
Good morning, that's a nice TNETENNBA.
Someone reminded me, you haven't yet got a word less than eight letters.
It's quite extraordinary.
You really do look like you're on your way to winning that Countdown teapot.
No offence, Jeremy.
- Who are you?
!
- Want me to do your windows?
What?
!
What?
!
I can't understand you.
There we are, mate.
No!
No, no!
Stop cleaning my windows!
I want to go to the toilet.
I don't know what you're saying.
I did the window there and the Yes, yes.
Okey-dokey.
I can't understand what you're saying.
Can I leave my bike for a few minutes?
Okay, then.
All right, bye-bye.
What are you doing?
Why are you bringing the bike inside?
What?
No!
Where are you going?
!
Where are you going?
Why do I have your bike?
And, then, when he leaves, he just leaves all of his stuff in my flat.
- What stuff?
- All his window cleaning bollocks, the ladder, bike, everything.
It's still there!
What, in your flat?
Yeah.
He never came back.
- Yeah.
He never came back.
- How did he even get in?
Well, he was very persuasive.
I think.
Well, I don't know how to get in touch with this guy.
His stuff is cluttering up my hallway.
I've had to start putting these up.
My mum always says, you should never open the door.
What do you mean?
An unopened door is a happy door.
So we never answer ours when someone knocks.
- What, so you all just sit there?
- Yes.
So the doorbell goes and you all just sit there until the person goes away?
Yes.
What if it's important?
What if it's good news?
This is London, Jen.
It's not someone with cake!
Unless that cake is made of dog poo and knives!
Laters.
I'm going to zone out at the heads of department meeting.
I thought you were trying to avoid those.
There's only so many times I can say there's a RAM emergency.
Hello?
Yes?
Hello.
Can I come in?
- Why?
- What?
Why do you want to come in?
Isn't this the heads of department meeting?
Every Monday and Friday?
Or has it changed?
No, no, yes, it is.
You've missed a few though, haven't you?
Yeah, there was a RAM emergency.
The office had too much RAM.
Okay, well you see the nature of the meetings has changed somewhat and it wouldn't be fair on you.
There'd be a lot of catching up.
Oh, okay!
Okay!
Thanks, Jen!
They don't want me.
They don't want me at the Monday-Friday!
I thought you hated those meetings?
I did hate those meetings until they didn't want me at those meetings.
And now I love those meetings.
Five minutes, Mr Moss.
Thanks, Phil.
A fan of tiny biscuits.
You are full of surprises.
Please, don't let me stop you.
I like a man with appetite.
It's what got you this far.
Sorry, do I know you?
They call me Prime.
I had another name, once.
I no longer go by it.
Harold Tong.
That's right.
I won year 16 of Countdown.
Yes, it was I who won the 16th Countdown teapot.
The teapot we all crave.
You crave it too.
Your eyes betray you.
He has spirit, this one.
But do you have the spirit to become an ultimate champion, I wonder?
Do you want to get a photo together or something?
I came only to give you this.
What is it?
Roy?
Jesus!
Alistair, hey!
Long time no see!
Yeah.
Roy and I were at college together.
Yeah.
Wow, you are looking great!
Thanks.
So what are you up to these days?
What am I up to?
Wow.
Big question.
I'm the head writer for Shotgun games?
Do you know them?
Yeah!
Wow!
Really?
I play Shotgun games all the time.
They're brilliant.
Oh, thank you.
Wow, that is so cool.
Hey, you just won an award, right?
Yes.
Well, see you soon, Roy.
Yes.
Don't ask me what I'm doing, you arrogant twat.
Sorry, I'm not sure I'm in the right place.
Oh, you're in the right place, Mr Moss.
Welcome to Eight Plus.
You came!
I'm glad.
That's Roger Black.
That's Steven Pawlin.
You know your ex-Countdown winners.
Why are they all here?
Why, for someone who knows how to add and subtract and multiply and divide lots of numbers to get one other number, you're not so good at putting two and two together, are you?
This is Eight Plus!
An exclusive club for those gifted few who make it through to eight episodes of Countdown.
And you are our newest member.
Oh, isn't that nice?
Thanks for letting me know.
All right.
All right.
Bye.
Does it not outrage you, Roy, as a member of this IT department, that I, your head, is not being represented at the Monday-Friday?
Couldn't give a shit.
My neighbour just called.
Turns out that window-washing Willie from West Gibberish is not now going to be able to pick up his window cleaning bric-a-brac.
Why not?
Oh, he was hit by a car or something.
Just my luck!
You shouldn't have agreed to mind it for him in the first place.
Thanks, Jen.
That's really helpful.
That's really good advice.
That's exactly what I'll do.
In the past!
When it happens again, last week.
I have to give it back to him!
It can't just live in my hallway!
Don't give a shit!
No, no.
Oh, no!
No!
No!
Alistair!
I'm not a window cleaner!
Alistair!
Alistair!
I'm not a window cleaner.
I'm not a window cleaner!
Alistair!
I'm not a window cleaner!
All right, something weird is going on in that room.
They're wearing dressing gowns.
Roy, will you listen to me?
I don't have to listen to you.
I'm not married to you.
I've got a lot on my mind right now, Jen.
This bloke thinks I'm a window cleaner.
Bloke I went to college with.
He's doing amazingly The creature he was with.
And he thinks that I am a window cleaner.
A window cleaner!
What's wrong with that?
It's a noble profession.
If your last profession was cleaning balls!
Google him.
I've tried.
He has no online presence.
Apparently people were being rude to him so he suspended all his accounts.
He's not on Friendface, he's not on Chitter.
Listen How do people expect you to track them down if they maintain no online presence!
?
You've both asked and answered that question.
What's going on up there?
Is this meeting room five?
You know, they soundproofed that a few weeks ago?
Really?
What's that all about?
Douglas said it was for super secret meetings.
But I want to go to super secret meetings.
I can't believe I might be missing super secret meetings.
But the dressing gowns.
Why are they wearing dressing gowns?
Orgies!
No.
Maybe they're getting some kind of executive massage treatment for being brilliant.
Do you think they're getting massages?
If they're getting massages, I think my human rights are being abused by them not letting me in.
Why don't you wear a towel, hang around the door, and see if they let you in?
I have my dignity, thank you, Moss.
No.
Hang on, that might just work!
I can't believe you've joined a swanky club.
It's so showbizzy!
Roy, the people here see me in a certain way.
It's perhaps not the way I've been seen outside of the club.
I'd just like you not to, you know, mention it in any way you know.
Sure.
Yeah.
No problem.
Hello, Terence.
Glass of milk.
Straight up.
Prime?
Ribena for me.
Roy?
Oh, I'll have a beer.
Thank you.
Alcohol-free beer, surely?
No.
Get him what he wants.
But - But - Just get him what he wants.
I'll have to go out.
Can somebody mind the bar?
No.
You know what?
It's fine.
I shouldn't really be drinking during lunch.
I'll just have a coke.
It's fine.
Will I see you tonight?
Not now, Ivana.
Did you have sex with that lady?
If you call that mindless animalistic rutting sex, then yes, I suppose we did.
That sounds like sex!
Countdown Groupies are the most sexually voracious of all groupies, and the most beautiful.
I hear someone likes drinking beer.
This is a private booth, Negative One.
Is that a name?
!
This is a private club, Word.
Word!
True dat!
True dat, innit.
My name is Word here.
Roy, please.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Negative One.
Heard you been catching some nice letters.
I get the same letters as everyone else.
Good when they fall in the right order, though, innit?
Steady, gentlemen.
Boom!
Don't mind him.
Negative One was quite proud of being our best speller until Moss came along.
Ah, our drinks.
Can I just say I am having a great time!
Hey, y'all.
Turn the music off.
Turn the music off!
What's he up to?
Maybe our new champion would like to test his skills out on the street.
He's challenging you to a game of Street Countdown.
You cannot accept.
It's too dangerous!
Well, what do you say?
Or is you worried you is going to show yourself up in front of your girlfriend?
He's calling Roy your girlfriend.
Within the walls of Eight Plus, that's a definite diss.
You're lucky my "girlfriend" has gone to the toilet.
Is you going to answer me or what?
No!
We promised those days were over.
No more unlicensed Street Countdown battles!
I didn't arks you.
I arksed him.
Well?
What is Street Countdown?
It's more or less the same as normal Countdown, except we play it on the street.
That doesn't sound that dangerous.
It can get quite cold.
I always wear thermals.
Ah, then you're probably fine.
Hey, I is still standing here.
What do you say, newbie?
I came here to drink milk and kick ass.
And I've just finished my milk.
Welcome to Street Countdown!
First rule of Street Countdown is that you really must try and tell as many people as possible about it.
It's a rather fun game and the more people we tell about it the better.
What the f?
!
Where is everyone?
Hello?
Hello?
Moss?
Ivana?
Hello?
Hello in there!
Oh, for f!
Oh, hey!
Hey mate!
Mate!
Could you do me a favour?
So do you just do big windows, or do you do call outs?
What, did you think I would come round and do your house?
No.
No.
Didn't think that.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, hey!
Alistair!
Alistair!
It's me!
Alistair!
I'm not a window cleaner!
Hello?
I'm not a window cleaner!
I've got to go.
I'm I'm not a window cleaner!
Oh, that bloke.
He thinks I'm a bloody window cleaner!
Not that there's It's a noble profession.
Is this as fast as this goes?
Consonant.
Vowel.
Vowel.
Boom!
I'll take a further consonant.
Consonant, you get me?
I'll take a vowel this time.
I'll have what he's having vowel.
I'll have another consonant.
Give me one of dem sweet, sweet consonants, you get me?
I'll take a consonant, plain and simple, thank you.
I'll take an even sweeter vowel.
I'll take a regular vowel, please.
Yeah, I think I think that's probably enough letters, yeah?
18 letters.
I've never seen so many!
He is the one.
What happened to you?
!
Shh!
This is the longest word yet on Street Countdown.
Unlike normal Countdown, you see, what happens I don't care.
Negative One?
Moss?
Your word, Negative One?
Enormousness.
I shall give my answer, if I may, in the form of a joke.
This is most irregular.
What do you call Negative One sitting alone in an empty room?
I don't know.
What do you call Negative One sitting alone in an empty room?
Overnumerousness!
Gyles?
Yes, that is a word!
And the joke does make sense.
Okay, let's go!
Oh, yes!
Shit.
Five, six, seven Ah!
Jen, you've joined us.
Yes, yes, I have!
You're not really dressed for it.
Thought I'd wear normal clothes and work up a real sweat.
Hardcore.
There's me thinking you didn't have it in you.
Right, now let's take it to the max.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Hey!
Hey, Alistair!
Oh, God, I can't believe I got you!
How you doing?
Yeah, no, it's Roy.
Yeah, hello.
Listen, Alistair, I just wanted to say, I'm not a window cleaner.
No, no, I work in IT.
Yeah, yeah, with computers and all that.
Macs?
No, I really just work with Windows.
Hello?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1 Space.
What is it?
The simple answer is, we don't know.
Or at least, we didn't know until now.
Hello, I'm Douglas Reynholm.
And I'm not a scientist, but I do have a better understanding of what space is than any scientist living today.
Where did I gain these insights?
From this man.
The founder of Spaceology, Beth Gaga Shaggy, no relation to either Lady Gaga or Shaggy, is the founder of Spaceology.
A religion, not a cult.
In other words, when it comes to space, he's the man with his head screwed on tight.
This is what he told me when I met him on holiday two weeks ago.
Space is invisible mind dust and stars are but wishes.
I mean, think about that!
That means every star you can see in the night sky is a wish that has come true.
And they've come true because of something he calls Spacestar Ordering.
Spacestar Ordering is based on the twin scientific principles of star maths and wishy thinking.
If you'd like to know more, there are thousands of Spaceology centres all over the UK.
If that doesn't convince you, well, then, maybe you just don't deserve to get what you want.
Wow.
You're a genius, Ray!
Love the special effects!
How did you do that thing where I'm spinning around?
Well, in that bit, you're actually spinning around.
Well, I'm glad you like the website, Mr Reynholm, I did spend quite a lot of time on it.
It's brilliant, and well worth every penny of the Â£50.
Â£100 Didn't we say Â£100?
I never would have agreed to that.
Ah, Jen!
Guess who wanted a helicopter this time last week and now, thanks to Spacestar Ordering, has one?
You?
I'll give you a clue-- It ain't these chaps!
You?
You're a sceptic, Jen.
You should be more like these.
They can't get enough of my Spacestar Ordering story.
Yes, yes, I noticed you've been coming down here a lot more often because of all the questions.
So, Mr. Reynholm, how did the cosmos grant you a helicopter?
Well, I visualised the thing I wanted.
In my case, it was a helicopter.
I drew a picture of the helicopter on a piece of paper, then I stood with my back to space, threw the paper over my shoulder and wished really hard.
But, when you say that you stood with your back to space - Yes.
- how exactly did you achieve that?
I waited till night time.
Of course.
Couple of days later, bought myself a helicopter.
Explain that one, if you can!
I wish the cosmos would make it slightly harder to find our office.
Don't worry, Jen, you'll get your wish, just as I one day, I'll get my robot hand.
Scientific mind, believes in Spacestar Ordering.
Who's getting the robot hand first?
Hey, you're still up for tonight, right?
I'll go if Moss goes.
Sorry, Jen.
I find music confusing and annoying.
Roy invited me to a gig once.
I didn't really enjoy it.
You went to the wrong address.
You went to a swimming pool.
Are you sure it's not swimming pools that you find confusing and annoying?
You're right.
It's not music I hate, it's swimming!
You know what?
I will come, Roy.
Where's Moss?
I can't believe he's missing out on this.
Where are they?
I'm going to have to go dance at the front.
Aren't you a bit old for the front?
I'm 31!
Good for you, mate!
Careful!
My foot!
You chill out, man!
Jesus!
Get out of town!
You hooked up with someone from the band?
- Wow, who was it?
- Norman.
Norman?
Oh, he's the drummer, right?
The keyboard player.
The keyboard player?
OK.
What?
No, it's just The keyboard player?
Really?
!
Yeah.
What?
It's just he's a bit geeky, isn't he?
I didn't think he was your type.
Jen's going out with a geek!
Are you sure it's not just because he's in a band?
Yes.
I really am that shallow, Roy!
I know you are.
Yeah, I'm that shallow.
You are, though.
I mean, you really, really are.
Look, I like him.
He doesn't say a lot, he's more of a thinker.
I think he's really cool.
It's because he's in a band!
Oh, flippin' hell.
Is this your back again?
When did mosh pits become so unruly?
I told you, you should get a massage.
Oh, I've never enjoyed having massages.
I don't like being naked in front of strangers, and I can never relax if I think someone might play Norah Jones.
Who wants to hear another Spacestar Ordering success story?
Oh, wait, wait!
Yeah, yeah.
OK, OK.
Go!
Last week, I decided I wanted to learn how to do tattoos.
So, I did the business.
Bought a book on tattoos, read it, and now I know how to do tattoos.
Look!
My helicopter!
Oh, that's brilliant.
Let me see it Ow!
What the bloody hell's wrong with you?
I have a really bad back.
You should see a masseuse.
Don't see a masseuse!
They're the biggest con of the 20th century.
I had a bad back, and I cured it, thanks to the techniques outlined in this groundbreaking expose of the massage industry.
Go like this.
And push your back up.
Oh, for fuuu!
That's worse!
That's way worse.
It's terrible, isn't it?
You told me that would make it better!
No, no, no!
That's how I originally injured my back.
You all right?
Yeah, feels so much better already!
So that's why I ended up joining the parachute regiment.
Ah, yeah, the Paras.
That's the one I would have joined.
But you know, fear of heights Were you in the army?
No.
Right, I have to do a bit of work on your thighs.
Hey, you do what you need to do.
Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
What was Mancini thinking, eh?
The thing about Arsenal is, they always try and walk it in.
Arsenal?
Whoever we're talking about.
Right nearly done.
Oh, thanks again, man, this really does feel so much better.
Right.
Oh, yeah!
There we are.
All finished.
I love him I love him, I love him so.
Goodness me!
What-what-what would you term what just happened there?
Norman says my voice is extraordinary.
He's right.
This is it, you know.
This is the guy.
This is the big one.
There's nothing about him I don't like.
When he's asleep, he makes this sound a lovely, little, gentle purr.
Oh, this is a long song.
You know, the last few days has been indescribable.
Good.
Hi, Roy!
Hi, Roy.
What?
You OK?
What?
Are you all right?
Is your back still hurting?
Didn't you go to see the masseuse?
Yes, I did.
Did it help?
No.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, fine.
It's just you'vegot the same face you have when you eat vegetables.
OK.
Something happened.
Something happened?
Yes.
When I was getting the massage, the masseuse did something.
Go on.
OK, I'm going to tell you, but you have to promise not to laugh at me, because this whole thing has left me very shaken.
- OK.
I promise I will not laugh.
- OK.
He kissed me on the arse.
Sorry, I may have misheard you there, Roy.
What did you just say?
I was enjoying the massage, everything had gone very, very well, but then at the end he just leaned down, and he gave me a big kiss on the arse.
And you thought I'd find that funny?
!
Well, yeah, I suppose I did.
On what planet would that be funny?
Whereabouts on the arse did he kiss you?
I don't know, just to the left of the the line that goes down the middle.
The cleftal horizon.
Is that what it's called?
Yes, it is, but never mind that, what happened next?
Well, then I just got dressed and I left.
OK.
Have you told Jen this?
No, I was really afraid she'd laugh at me.
Do you think Jen's a monster?
!
She wouldn't laugh-- This man crossed the line!
He is a member of the medical profession.
Roy, look at me.
Look at me!
There is nothing funny about this.
I think he crossed the line.
I don't think it's funny.
I mean, I was so relaxed, and then that just tensed me right up again.
My hands were like that for an hour.
I couldn't get them in to my pockets to pay him.
You paid him?
!
Roy, I've got to tell you, I think you've got grounds to sue.
Really?
What is that?
!
That's Jen.
That's what she does now.
You should tell her.
You should tell her.
What?
Listen to this.
Jen, you know that I went for that massage?
Yeah.
You are not going to believe this.
The bloke who did it kissed me on my arse.
No, Jen, my masseuse kissed me on my bum!
My body went into spasms!
My hands were like this for an hour!
Stop it!
You're killing me!
You've got to spread that kind of material out!
I can't believe this!
So what's the problem?
I know!
He doesn't write, he doesn't call!
What, did you think he was coming on to you?
I don't know!
Maybe he's like the Michelangelo of physical therapists and that was his signature.
Maybe he does it to everybody.
Look, to be honest, I don't care why he did it.
All I know is that I was vulnerable.
I was naked, and he kissed me on my bottom.
I'll tell you something, this is not the last he has heard of me.
As God is my witness, no man shall ever have to be kissed on the bottom unexpectedly because of this man ever again.
Will you stop laughing?
!
This is the first time I've left before you.
We're looking up legal precedents of Roy being kissed on the arse.
Don't sue him, Roy.
You'll get on the news.
- Don't listen to her.
- Everyone will laugh!
No-one will laugh!
Come on, Jen, help us bring this monster to justice!
I can't.
The band are playing a new song tonight, they want my opinion.
You know to just say, "It's great", right?
Roy, I am a person.
With thoughts and opinions.
No.
You're not.
Jen, please, just say, "It's great".
When people like that ask you what you think, all they want to hear is that they're geniuses.
Goodbye.
She is evil.
Spacestar ordering success story number three.
My tattoo got infected, so they've had to cut off my arm!
I am getting a robot hand!
In the war I am beautiful Beautiful.
Really beautiful.
Thank you.
It's just a great song.
Really, really great.
If you put a gun to my head and forced me to give one criticism, it'd be that maybe it goes on just a bit too long.
- Apart from that, perfect.
- OK.
Listen, Tim, Mary's not going to make it tonight.
What'll we do about backing vocals?
I'd love to!
Moss, can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Do I have to testify?
I can't make that decision for you, Roy.
You've just got to ask yourself one thing if you don't take the stand, how many more unsolicited bum kisses will be administered by that lip-happy bastard?
No, you're right, I know you're right.
I do want to testify.
I'm just afraid that they're going to laugh at me.
What if they're all what if they're all like Jen?
They're not going to laugh, Roy.
No-one's like Jen.
No-one.
I've come to realise she's actually a very odd person.
Well, good luck tonight, everyone!
Are you a big Stevie Nicks fan, Jen?
Stevie Nicks?
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, God.
Thanks so much for this, guys, I'm so excited.
I've never done anything like this before.
I can't believe you want me to do it!
I won't let you down.
So, Norman, we've had a talk.
And we think we're going to go back to not having a keyboard in the band.
Oh, no!
Yeah, I'm sorry, but we'll see you both again soon, yeah?
Wait!
I'm out too?
And the defendant gave no indication that he had any intention of kissing you on the bottom?
No indication whatsoever.
He just kissed me on my bottom.
Out of nowhere.
What was the result?
Well, I had nightmares about it.
And I can't stop washing my bottom.
And I find it hard to trust masseurs.
Where exactly did he kiss you?
- It was in the middle.
- In the middle of your bottom?
Well, just to the left of the cleftal horizon.
In layman's terms, please, Mr. Trenneman.
Oh, I'm sorry, your Honour.
Just to the left of the bum line.
Just above the thigh?
Well above the thigh.
It was on my bottom.
Although it is true, is it not, that what some people call their bottom, others might call their hip.
No, he kissed my bottom, sir.
- But is it not true - He kissed me on my bottom!
Why is no-one laughing?
It's no laughing matter, Jen.
We Spaceologists take this kind of thing very seriously.
Are all these people Spaceologists?
Yes, this trial could bring the massage industry to its knees.
And you'll find they take this case with the gravity it deserves.
Perhaps Mr. Trenneman might be able to help us with the aid of this diagram.
Could you please place this picture of the defendant on the area where you say he kissed you?
That was where the incident happened.
- I think that's accurate.
- Oh, you think that is accurate?
Yes.
Only a moment ago you were quite sure, yet now you only think.
You're twisting my words.
Is it not true that this may simply be an artist, proud of his work, signing off with a flourish?
That is not the point.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Trenneman.
That will be all.
My arse is not a canvas!
I said, that will be all, thank you.
My bottom is not a kissing post, sir.
OK, you can dress this up however you like, with your fancy words, with your fancy words, but the truth remains that that man, sitting there, kissed me on my bike rack and I was not expecting it and it rendered an expensive massage worthless.
Your Honour, please.
And I am here today so that no man need be kissed on his sweetmeats by this man ever again, unless they have arranged it beforehand for some reason.
- Will you be silent?
- I will not be silent!
I will never be silent!
I will not stop until those lips are behind bars!
How dare you?
I trusted you.
My trouser hams are not for sale, sir!
I put my arse in your hands.
I rest my case.
I'd have used my robot hand for good.
Wake up!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1 I'm sorry guys, I wish I could've come here with a better news.
But, according to these projections Reynholm Industries is in a critical position.
We took a major downturn last year.
Like the rest of the economy.
And as a result, we have estimated losses at well over Â£400 million.
Before we go on, Linda.
Do you need to go to the toilet?
No.
Then why are you doing a wee-wee walk?
It's incredibly odd and distracting.
- Maybe it's just me?
- No, it's is not just you Douglas.
I'm also finding it very distracting.
Sorry, Linda.
Don't worry about it, Jen.
It is not a wee-wee walk.
I'm actually doing around the world virtual triathlon for charity, using an iPhone application and Google Maps.
Look, I'm in Spain.
God, that's hugely impressive.
- Haven't you just had a baby?
- So they tell me.
Ah, for God's sake.
Sorry, did that sound like words?
Now, do go on.
And congratulation on getting an iPhone.
I say, we get in Silvio Bernatelli.
Bernatelli?
The most successful businessman of the year.
Why, a word from him can make or break a business.
Look, Reynholm Industries is in a tough spot.
But with Bernatelli as an investor?
I think we can come out on top.
This is very convincing, Linda.
Damn good job.
Damn good bloody good damn good job.
You're the best woman here.
You, are an excellent woman.
Linda!
Bloody Linda.
I'm so good at business things Reynholm Industries.
God, do you have any idea how annoying this woman is?
I have an inkling.
I just had a eureka moment.
Why do I keep my phone in my trousers pocket?
It's too far but look at this Top pocket.
Yeah?
Not as far Yeah?
Look at that.
See how smooth that is Oh, mama!
Do you see that?
You wish you saw that.
- Sorry, did I interrupt - No.
She had a baby like yesterday, and she's already invading Spain.
Linda just had a baby?
Wow, well you never know What?
Too much information.
What?
That she had a baby?
Come on.
Moss, it's a natural part of life.
It's not a natural part of my life and I aim to keep it that way.
You should be okay.
What's that jacket for?
It's not for anything, it was a present.
Julia got it for me.
How is Julia the orphan?
- Don't call her that.
- Why?
That's the first thing you told us about her.
I totally think of her as Julia the orphan.
Well, get out of the habit of it.
What if it slips out when you meet her in person?
I'm hardly like to say "Hello, Judy the Orphan", am I?
I totally would say that to her.
- Yeah, I know you would.
- But she still an orphan, right?
Yes!
Her parents haven't come back to life.
Have you find out the story of what happened to them?
No, she doesn't really like talking about it.
Why are you not super curious?
I know I would be.
Yeah, you know, it's none of my business.
Maybe they're not really dead.
Maybe she doesn't know what the word orphan means.
Maybe she thinks it just means house-proud.
I'm leaving now.
- Roy?
- Yeah?
What's that jacket for?
It's not for anything.
Will you be wearing that all the time now?
Yeah, maybe.
In fact, Julia thinks I can pull it off.
- You don't like it?
- It's the worst thing ever.
You look like a tall girl.
Maybe a little feminine.
I can understand why you wouldn't like it then.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh come on.
This Linda business we got this, six or seven times a week.
It's always the same, it's never about a man.
You're just one of those woman You're one of those woman, who don't like women.
Burn it.
You should burn the jacket.
And all these for Sports Relief.
We all have to do our bit.
First you made me want to go to the toilet and now you make me want to be a better person.
A bit of news on the Bernatelli front, by the way, Douglas.
His translator is sick.
So we'll have to hire one.
I could translate if you want.
Can you speak Italian, Jen?
Very impressive.
Not before I flush the toilet.
Thank you very much.
Beautiful and delicate young lady.
- With such butch hands.
- Oi I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
You got lovely hands.
And that's a lovely ring.
I haven't noticed that before.
That was my mom's.
Oh, I'm sorry, Julia.
I didn't mean I know you don't like talking about all that stuff.
- No, I'm sorry, Roy.
- Yeah.
I should just tell you the whole story, because you gonna have to know sooner or later.
If you don't mind, I'd like to get it all out now.
Just as long as we never talk about it again.
There was a fire.
A fire?
Oh, God.
It's awful.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
We were on holiday.
We went to a Sea Parks.
- You know, Sea Parks like the Sea World.
- Yeah, sure Sea Parks.
It was during a sea lion show.
A fire during a sea lion show at Sea Parks.
The flame surrounded us so quickly, and we couldn't We couldn't - Oh, are you okay?
- I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Just promise me, we'll never talk about it again.
Sure, sure.
Of course - But, how the - I don't want to talk about it!
You don't speak Italian?
No.
Why did you say you did?
No one was paying any attention to me.
So what did you actually say at the meeting?
I don't know.
Very impressive.
He wants me to do a conference call with him.
- What am I gonna do?
- All these lies, Jen.
This is exactly what happened with the Iraq war.
It's not that much of a lie, Moss, because I have always wanted to speak Italian and I can sound like I'm speaking Italian, so it's more or less the same thing.
Yeah, except to Italians.
Or people who can understand Italian.
Exactly.
Oh, God.
I'm just gonna blue-sky this.
Would it be of any help, whatsoever if I were to install a voice activated translation program on your laptop?
No, stupid idea!
Stupid idea.
No, no, no, no.
Voice activated?
Does that mean someone would speak and the translation would appear on the computer screen?
Actually, now that you put it like that that could work.
Well done.
Good idea, Jen.
Thank you?
The jacket!
He's still wearing the jacket.
Are you alright, Roy?
Is it the jacket?
Because, it should be.
- No.
It's, um - What?
Julia told me the story.
So, what happened?
Her parents died in a fire.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, that's horrible.
Yeah, yeah, it was a fire.
At Sea Parks.
- Sea Parks?
- Yeah.
- With the - With the whales and everything, yeah Well, okay.
- Sea Parks?
- Yeah.
- A fire?
- That's right.
At a sea lion show, apparently.
Aren't those shows usually out in the open?
Well, yeah, I mean that's what I would've - Yeah.
- Lots of water everywhere.
Yeah, I mean, I would imagine the whales need a lot of water.
I don't think you can have whales in a place where there isn't a huge amount of water.
It just seems like a weird place to go on fire.
It's a very weird place to go on fire.
A fire?
At a Sea Parks?
It's the weirdest thing I've ever heard.
Well, maybe Maybe if there were plastic seats.
- Maybe they could go on - They don't have plastic seats at Sea Park.
How do you know?
Roy, when I was on holiday, I lived at Sea Parks.
It's the funnest, wettest, most splish-splashy, place in the world.
Okay, did you go and see the sea lion show?
Three times a day, for two weeks.
- And did they have plastic - No, it's all stone steps.
They won't went on fire.
I've check Wikipedia, there is no mention of a fire at any Sea Parks.
Do you think maybe she's lying?
No, I mean, why would she lie?
And if she was going to lie, why would she use this one?
A fire at a Sea Parks.
It's wrecking my head.
I mean, if she had said that her parents are drowned, I'd be the happiest man in the world.
But, a fire?
At a Sea Parks?
Well, it's just It's just oh It opens up a lot of questions.
- Maybe, you could ask her?
- No, no, no, no.
We can never talk about it again.
- Well, maybe you could just - No, no, no, no, no.
We can never talk about it for the rest of our lives.
Well, then, I suppose you're just going to have to try and stop thinking about it.
That's another great idea.
You're on fire.
If you pardon the expression.
I would be very happy to come and have a look.
Next week, is good for me.
We're certainly looking forward to your visit.
And can't wait to give you the full Reynholm Industries experience.
He says he's looking forward to meeting me.
Ciao.
Maybe, you're the best woman.
Twelve exits.
There are twelve exits.
What are you doing?
- What?
- What are you doing on the computer?
Masturbating.
Isn't it Bernatelli today?
Shouldn't you be preparing?
No, I think I'm okay, Moss.
I've learned a few conversational basics and when he gets going, I'll just fire up this baby.
I do wanna feel refreshed though, at the meeting, so I'm gonna go to sleep for a few hours.
Is that what you're having for lunch?
A big pile of mashed potato.
I fancy it.
It's a Sea Parks, isn't it?
You're building a Sea Parks out of mashed potato.
There are twelve exits, Moss.
Twelve exits!
For only 200 people.
You don't close encounters crazy, Roy.
- You need to let it go.
- To have killed anyone the fire has to start, here, here, and here.
And close in like this.
But, how is it spreading?
There is no wood in a Sea Parks arena.
And why is there no wood?
Because it rots.
And why does it rot?
Because of all the water Damn, that mash looks tasty.
Password?
It didn't ask for a password before Moss?
Where's Moss?
It's payday, he's probably gone to Namco.
Where's Namco?
Flip!
It's an iPhone!
There's a flipping iPhone in the play machine.
I'm out of coin.
Moss!
Moss.
What am I gonna do What are you How did you get in there?
Through the hole.
Why?
There's an iPhone, Jen.
An actual iPhone.
I need your password, I need the password for the translation program.
Help me get the iPhone first.
- I can't move my arms.
- No.
I need to get it through the shoots, someone else will take it if you don't.
I'm sure they're not giving it away, the engineer must've dropped it.
No, no, no, it's the price.
It's the price, you got to help me.
- I don't have time.
- But, it's an iPhone, Jen.
I may be able to get an iPhone without giving any money to Apple.
I'll be living the dream.
What's the password?
Moss, the password.
Moss!
Moss!
Oh, I'm so excited about the sea lion show.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Luigi Joe and, Slippery Pete.
Oh, no.
What's all this smoke?
What smoke?
Oh, yeah, smoke Where is it?
They must be blocking it.
I'll try to move to clear the passage.
Come on, Moss.
Come on, Moss.
You can do it.
Push!
Come on, Moss.
Keep breathing.
- Push!
- Shut up!
You can do it, Moss.
- I hate you!
- Why are saying that?
I don't know!
Stop talking!
Come on, Moss.
Come on.
That's it.
It's coming I can see, I can see the start button!
Come on, Moss, push.
One, two, three Push!
Come on, Moss.
Push!
Push!
It's beautiful.
Password!
Where the hell have you been?
Sorry, it's just It doesn't matter.
So far, he's satisfied with Jen.
We laughed it.
Mr. Bernatelli, meet Jen.
Leave that laptop outside.
- No.
What?
- We have to think about security, Jen.
How do we know that laptop, isn't somehow able to connect to the internet?
- No, no.
It is a - Then get it out of here!
Look, look at this, look how long it takes to go on fire.
And this is made of matches.
First of all, I like to extend the warmest welcome to Mr. Bernatelli.
And how today, is the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership.
He says, "It's a pleasure to be here".
I see, so If the fire started here, and they were there, then there's no way they could've escaped.
So, they must have been there.
I should stop it.
Aw, my hands!
I have always wanted to visit England.
I'm looking forward to something.
Some of your famous English food.
Well, I'm sure that can be arranged.
- So, what do you wanna talk about?
- Now you listen to me, Bernatelli.
I hope by the end of this meeting we could become firm friends.
I like you, and I like what you've done with your company.
Hopefully, we can join forces, and plow away through these uncertain times.
What do you say?
Bernatelli and Reynholm Industries.
Together we'll be bigger than ever.
Hey, I'm gonna stand up, and start talking slightly louder.
Do you like my suit or not?
The woman to my left, smells likes she's been for a run.
This meeting is going better than you might think.
I love what you have done with this office.
Can I borrow some of your erotic art?
For how long?
On second thoughts, I'm gonna go.
Never contact me again, because I'm mental.
Well, that was a waste of time.
Next time you have a bright idea, Linda, keep it to yourself.
- But - And for God's sake, get a shower.
- Oh, my god, Roy.
- Hiya Oh, my God, you poor thing.
Your hands How did it happen?
It's kind of hard to explain.
- But, what - I don't wanna talk about it.
Moss!
Hello Hello Starting to get pretty lonely now.
These toys may smell of wee.
Count them all.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1 Come on, settle.
The sooner you're settled, the sooner this is over with.
Thank you.
Now, you're going to meet some men today who've taken a wrong turn in their lives and they're going to tell you their stories and hopefully make you think a little bit about the roads you're going down.
There's not going to be any kind of fun, so you can wipe those smiles off your faces.
Right, let's meet our first speaker.
What the flip are you looking at?
You think this is funny?
You think this is some kind of mother flipping joke?
Mother flippers think everything's a mother flipping joke.
Well, let me tell you, the jokey ain't no jokey, sucker.
Look at me and what do you see?
Just a bad ass brother who made a mistake.
One mistake.
And now I'm staring at you gimps.
Every flippin' day!
So what's my story?
How did a brother get here?
Well, I'll tell you.
It all started when I went to fix a printer on floor seven.
As I recall, it was a Tuesday.
It's a lot faster now, it's one of the advantages of the Pentium processor.
Yeah I like your glasses.
I'm afraid they're not for sale.
Ha ha.
Laugh all you want, they're not for sale.
You're funny.
Nikki, Nikki, Nikki!
What are you talking to Clive Sinclair for?
Shut up, Rodge.
Good one.
Yup.
I get it.
You obviously don't, mate.
Come on, back in your box.
Nice tie, by the way!
Thank you.
Roy, can you come here, please?
Just hold on a second, Jen.
I'm giving phone support.
Okay, so how did that go?
Well, yeah, but that's an important part of the process.
Yes, if you don't complete that part, there's no way you're going to be able to do the next bit.
Okay, so now Turn it back on again!
People!
That is rude!
What is that?
Oh, Jen, I have to say, "Have you tried turning it off and on again"?
1,000 times a day.
It's like a bloody catchphrase.
If it wasn't for you and Moss it would be the only thing I say.
It doesn't matter.
Don't take your bad career decisions out on the users.
I'm not saying it again today.
They can just figure it out for themselves.
You'll never go a whole day without saying it.
You don't think I can?
No way.
I bet you Â£1,000 I can.
That's just posturing.
Â£1,000.
All right.
Okay.
Â£100 says I don't say it again today.
How's that for posturing?
All right, you're on.
100 quid.
All right.
Can you come here for a sec, please?
I want you to take a look at something.
Can't I do it on the phone?
Just come in!
It's like 20 feet!
You all right, Moss?
I don't mind telling you, Roy, that sometimes the people upstairs cheese me off to such an extent that if I were the type to use bad language, I'd be employing it bitterly and repeatedly!
Whoa.
Moss, that's not like you.
Well, I'm sorry for mentioning bad language.
No, use bad language, Moss, please.
It'll make you feel better.
Ploppers!
Someone told me I need a browser on my computer.
Could you install one, please?
You don't have a browser on your computer?
What is that sound?
Is that coming from your laptop?
It's not supposed to sound What the?
!
What's all that crap?
Look at all this stuff!
I haven't seen that one since the '90s!
Jen, I have to fix this.
No, no, leave it!
I have it how I like it!
How you like it?
!
No, no, no, Jen, it's infected!
If this was a human being, I'd shoot it in the face!
I just want you to install a browser.
That's the browser there!
Look at it that's the browser.
Internet Explorer is a browser!
Behind the picture of the lady.
The lady's not supposed to be there.
She's only there sometimes.
But what about that, the E But that's the button for the internet, Roy.
I don't The button for the internet?
!
Jesus Christ!
Oh, shut up!
I'm not a stupid geeky geek.
Jen, you don't need to be a geek to know that you need a browser to access the internet!
Yes, you do, because as soon as you know something like that, it pushes out something important and before you know it, you're painting little figurines from Lord of The Rings.
You know what, Jen?
Do whatever you want.
I don't care.
You want to walk around with a laptop from The Exorcist, that's fine.
It's not my problem.
Our time is too valuable!
Come on, Moss, let's go.
It's nearly one.
Oh, don't forget.
They're giving a party for Ben Genderson at lunch.
Ben Genderson?
How nice for him.
He's been here, what?
A week?
When's our party?
I thought you hated parties.
I like parties.
It's balloons I don't like.
- Right.
- You don't like balloons?
Oh, don't talk to me about balloons.
- Why?
- Balloons explode, Jen.
They explode suddenly and unexpectedly.
They are filled with the capacity to give me a little fright and I find that unbearable.
Where do you want to go for lunch?
It's such a lovely day, shall we go to the park?
Yeah, let's have a lovely lunch in the park.
Roy, do you think if I hadn't paid so much attention in school I'd be a different person?
No.
We're going to be late for Ben Genderson's party.
So?
I don't want to go to that thing.
If we go to that party, do you know how many times I'm going to have to say, "Have you" The thing that I say?
We've got to hurry up, we're going to be in trouble.
I'm not running.
Can you do a fast walk?
No.
I'm going to do a fast walk.
See you there.
I need to be at work.
Sorry, sir.
Whole street's closed.
Suspicious package.
Come on, let's go the long way round.
We'll miss the presentation.
We're already late.
We'll get in trouble.
Calm down.
I can't, Roy.
What are we going to do?
Moss, it doesn't matter.
We're going to get in trouble.
You're not going to get in trouble.
Getting in trouble is something that happens to children.
You're a grown man.
Come on.
Why don't we bunk off?
What?
!
I was hoping to avoid Jen today anyway.
Why don't we just We'll bunk off and make a day of it.
It'll be a laugh.
Oh, gosh, I've got to take this in.
I've never bunked off in my life!
What what what will we do?
Where will we go?
You know, we'll do bunking off kind of things.
Should we be talking this close to the police?
I mean, it is illegal Not unless you're supposed to be in school!
Will you relax?
I'm excited, Roy.
This is like taking the blue pill in the Matrix.
I mean, bunking off.
The old me would never have done that!
Say goodbye to that guy.
That guy's history!
BANG!
He's gone!
Could you not say "bang"!
There's a bloody bomb somewhere!
Come on, let's just go.
Would you stop looking so suspicious!
Which is why after one week with us, we honour Ben Genderson.
Come on, Ben, say a few words.
I don't know what to Such a lovely thing to happen.
I never thought that a major corporation would be able to focus on one individual like this.
At my last company, I felt rather insignificant, so it's appreciated, it really is.
Cheers.
Don't raise your glass too soon, Ben, 'cause this has all been one big ruse.
It isn't your day at all.
That's right.
I thought it high time to give the IT Department the attention they deserve.
Where are Mark and Ray?
They're not back from lunch yet.
Really?
I flew George Lucas in to see them as a treat.
Oh, well, Jen, more champagne for us.
Let the revels begin!
Oh, yes.
Sitting on the bus.
On the open road.
Kicking back.
Just a pair of cheeky bunkers.
- Couple of ne', er do wells.
- Yeah.
Roy, can I clarify something?
Are we now loitering?
Erm yeah.
Because it feels like travelling.
Sure, but we don't want to go where this bus is going.
So there's an element of loitering.
- There's an aimlessness.
- Exactly.
Yeah!
Who'd want to end up going to where they wanted to be?
- That's what the man wants.
- Sock it to 'em.
Fools!
Roy, let's glare.
What?
Let's glare at people, like a couple of tough nuts.
Okay!
Who?
Let's glare at this sucker on his way to work.
Feeding the corporate machine.
- He's coming up.
- He's getting on the bus!
Oh, no.
Why did you suggest him?
You could've suggested anybody.
- What are you looking at?
- We weren't.
We thought you were someone else.
- What's it to you?
- I'm sorry.
We're bunking off, and he's excited.
We're bunking off!
Roy has a fear of balloons.
A fear of balloons!
That's the craziest thing I've ever bloody heard!
Some wine for you.
- Sorry, I asked for red.
- Oh, sorry.
No, no, no, leave it.
This has been a success.
I have had a lovely, lovely time.
As thingy was saying earlier, it's easy to go unrecognised in a big corporation, so it's appreciated, it really is.
Cheers.
Don't raise your glasses too soon, 'cause this ruse has also been a ruse.
Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce to you our new head of hiring and firing, Ben Genderson.
So, Ben, you've been circulating throughout this fake party, coming to conclusions.
Who's the obvious dead wood?
Well, yes.
Well, there's Paul over there, he's been putting his shopping on expenses.
James here, he can't spell, and Sorry, what's your name?
Jeremy.
Jeremy, yes.
Jeremy's a drunk.
And Jen.
Jen lacks basic computer skills, like thinking that I stands for "internet things".
Yeah.
I don't really need to know about those things.
I'm a relationship manager.
I manage my team, I'm a team leader.
And where's your team now?
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
Is this my party or not?
What are we doing?
We are loitering.
We are shopping.
We don't have any money, so it's definitely loitering.
Mark my words, in half an hour, we shall be asked to leave.
- Oh, it's Jen.
- Hello, Jen!
Where are you?
We're just sort of taking a long lunch sort of thing.
You can't!
I've been sent an e-mail questionnaire, have to do it today!
I don't know what you're talking about.
It wasn't Ben Genderson's thing, it was our thing.
And then it was some scary thing, and now he's sent me a questionnaire about my job and my computer won't work!
What do I do?
!
Is that the best you can do?
I'm not going to say it!
No!
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
Goddammit, Roy!
I didn't bunk off so I could do some flipping perusing!
I want a taste of the apple, Roy!
I want to bite the electric tiger's tail, and ride it till the end of the mother flipping line.
Will you just calm down, Moss?
- What are you doing?
- I'm shoplifting!
- You've just gone insane!
- I've never felt so alive!
We need to get this stuff back!
Okay, they're on to us.
Let's just go.
Erm, act normal.
What is wrong with you?
Who are you?
I don't know any more!
What are we going to do?
No, that's not going to work!
Okay, run!
Run, run, run!
Come on!
Come on!
Hello.
Do you wish for technical assistance?
Oh, God, I hate these!
Sorry?
What?
How dare you speak to me like that?
Sorry.
Can I have technical assistance, please?
Putting you through.
Cow.
Allo?
Hello?
Allo.
How can I be of assistance?
What?
How can I be of assistance?
I've got one of your laptops.
It won't get past the loading screen.
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
Yes.
Look, is there someone else I can talk to?
There is no-one else available.
All right, all right.
What model do you have?
- What model do I have?
- Yes.
It's a Zubion, I think.
Ah, the Zubion.
I have to say, we have been having problems with the Zubion.
Can you press delete while starting up?
I didn't get that.
Can you press delete while starting up?
No.
That was worse somehow.
Okay.
Can Can?
Yes.
Can you press Can you press.
Delete.
Delete.
Can I press delete?
While.
Wheel?
While.
Whhhheeeel?
While.
Er during!
While!
While.
Yes, while!
Yes.
Starting.
Allo?
Come on, Roy!
Come on!
We're nearly there!
It's no use.
I can't.
I can't.
We're going down again!
How many times is that now?
Oh, this is ridiculous!
I don't wanna do this any more!
Oh, all right.
All right.
What was all that about?
What?
You shouldn't be messing around on those things.
Go on.
Don't come back here.
I know your faces now!
Bunking off was a terrible idea.
I mean, you were completely out of control.
Do you even like Grand Designs?
Yuh!
You'll send those DVDs back to the shop.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Roy.
It's okay.
Okay, let's just try and get back in to work, and hopefully nobody will have noticed we were away.
Oh, my gosh!
It's a robot!
I've never seen one in the wild before.
Where've you come from, fella?
Huh?
Where do you come from?
Can we keep him, Roy?
I mean, if he doesn't belong to anyone?
I just don't understand what it's doing.
I mean, this is weird.
What is it?
Erm Moss?
What?
Get away from it.
Why?
Hello, Jen!
It's a robot!
- Get away!
- What?
Get away!
Get away from it.
There's a bomb!
What are you saying?
There's a bomb in the bag!
I think this might be a bomb disposal robot, Roy.
I know.
We should move away from it.
Yes.
We should.
But I don't seem to be able to move.
What?
- I can't move.
- What do you mean, you can't move?
I can't move.
- You have to move, Roy.
- I can't move!
I'm just having a couple of problems with it.
What kind of operating system does it use?
It's Vista!
We're going to die!
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
What?
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
What?
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
I just won 100 quid.
Okay.
Hang on a second.
Why are you still here?
Why haven't you run away?
Come on, Roy, we're a team.
I could-- Oh, wait, I could totally run away, couldn't I?
It's still not working!
Oh, this is a very common problem with Vista.
I can fix this.
I can fix this, Roy!
Everything's going to be okay.
Right.
Come here, you.
Wait for me!
Is there a customer support number?
Allo!
How can I be of assistance?
What?
So, that's my story.
It ain't a pretty story, but it's the only one I've got.
And if you bozos don't buckle up and fly right, it'll be your story too, capice?
You say you've been having problems with this particular bomb disposal computer?
What?
You must take good care, as the slightest movement can initiate the detonator procedure.
Seems to me like the domain link is incapacitated, so perhaps you could try turning off the robot, and then get the man to run away quickly?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1 And every other day, I take a short helicopter ride to Heston Blumenthal's restaurant.
Last night, I ate a chocolate radio that still worked in my stomach, and a flat chicken that was actually a glass of water.
Even the menu was edible.
They said it wasn't, but I ate it.
Sounds like you're living the life of Riley.
Well, I actually knew Riley, and yes, there are similarities.
And yet, there is some sadness in your life.
Tell me about Victoria.
You'll have to forgive me, there's been quite a few Victorias.
Your wife?
Oh, my God, my wife, oh yes, Victoria!
What a fantastic woman.
The two weeks we were married were unforgettable.
She disappeared in mysterious circumstances, did she not?
She vanished while washing the car.
Despite a search that lasted nearly five hours, we found nothing.
So naturally, we assumed the worst.
- You must miss her.
- More than words could say.
I'd give anything to see her walk through that door right now.
Hey, why don't you take your clothes off?
- What?
- Come on!
We both knew it was on the cards as soon as I realised you were a woman!
What if someone were to walk in?
I left strict instructions not to be disturbed in case we had sex.
There's no way anyone is walking through that door Hello, Douglas.
Victoria!
But I thought you were dead!
I must say, Douglas, you still don't seem very pleased to see me.
No, no, I must have eaten some bad stereo system.
- How's the wine?
- Exquisite.
From the chef's own cellar.
What are you doing, Victoria?
Last time I saw you, you were Washing the car?
Yes, I imagine you have many questions.
I was under a lot of stress that day, Douglas.
I think we both were.
We both knew it wasn't working.
I picked up my sponge and bucket with a heavy heart that day.
The rest is a blank.
The next thing I can remember with any clarity is being on a kayaking holiday two years later.
That looks good, what's that?
I sort of wish I'd ordered that.
Our invisible desserts have arrived!
I know we weren't happy that second week of our marriage, Douglas, but give us another chance, as a couple.
I don't know.
I don't think we can just pick up from where we left off.
No, Victoria, I'm sorry, it's over.
Oh God!
I forgot you could do that.
Maybe we should give it another go!
Nnngh Well that is new!
How are you doing that?
That might be the dog.
Heston!
I'd like to introduce you to my Wi-i-i-ife.
I want to divorce my wife.
- Why are you telling me?
- Aren't you with legal?
No.
Remind me?
IT.
Relationship manager.
Ah.
Well then I probably shouldn't have told you any of that.
Anyway I want to divorce her right now.
Now's too late.
Before now.
In fact, I want to have already divorced her, is that possible?
Well, as I said, I'm not a lawyer, so Yes, but you're a relationship manager, and this is a relationship!
Well, erm have you told her yet?
Kind of.
I changed my Friendface profile from "married" to "it's complicated".
That's not the same as telling her, Mr. Reynholm.
Yeah, but someone will pass it on.
Why not you?
- No!
- Oh, come on!
Please break up with my vanishing, car cleaning wife!
- I don't want to do it!
- I don't want to do it!
I'll give you I don't know Â£10,000.
Who are you again?
I'm Jen Barber.
I'm with the IT department at Reynholm Industries.
Sorry, I thought I was meeting my husband.
Mr. Reynholm asked me to convey a a message to you.
Mrs. Reynholm.
How long have you and Mr. Reynholm known each other?
- About ten years.
- Ten years, ten wonderful years.
Who are you?
Mrs. Reynholm Can I call you Victoria?
- No.
- Mrs. Reynholm.
Sometimes there is a day and then there is a night.
Sometimes there is a morn, and then there is an eve.
Flowers grow, trees are cut down, babies are born, but Lawyers exist.
What are you trying to say?
Oh, I can't do it, I just can't.
Let me guess.
My husband wants to leave me and he paid you a large amount of money to spare him the embarrassment of facing me.
Yes, but I'm not going to take the money I feel sick.
Of course you do, you're a normal person.
You're not upset?
No, because I'm not a normal person.
You see, what you're trying to do here but can't If the tables were turned, I wouldn't find it difficult at all.
In fact, it's how I met his first wife.
I didn't know these were edible too.
They're not.
What's all that?
I have to spend the afternoon with Douglas.
Somehow I've been drafted into his legal eagle fantasy.
Have you ever spent any serious time with that man?
He's unbelievable!
You should hear the way he talks about women.
Oh yeah, he's some piece of work.
He's like a sexy Hitler.
I mean, I don't expect to put on a pedal stool, but please, show a little respect!
I'm sorry, you don't expect to be put on a what?
On a pedal stool.
A pedal stool?
What's a pedal stool?
Oh, you know, you put women on it when you admire them, you know, the phrase.
Oh yeah, the famous phrase, "to be put on a pedal stool".
"Pedestal"!
What?
"Pedestal" is the word!
What's a "pedal stool"?
!
Did you really think there was such a thing as a pedal stool?
Shut up, everyone has blind spots.
Can you help me sort through all this legal crap, please, Moss?
I'd rather not.
I've not had good experiences with the legal system.
How come?
Well, when I was 11, I broke the patio window, and my mother sued me.
She sued you?
Yeah, to teach me a lesson.
She's always been a very aggressive litigator.
Can you even do that, can you sue your children?
It was kind of a show trial in the kitchen.
She made a little gallery for the cat.
Aw What happened?
She won.
I'm still paying costs.
"Pedal stool"!
212 million quid!
You can't be serious!
Oh, we're quite serious, Mr. Reynholm.
But that's enough to bring Reynholm Industries to its knees!
Bloody blast, this is up my arse!
That is the amount, it is not up for negotiation.
Balls from hell, you shit-twins!
Calm down, Mr. Reynholm.
Bollocks to be telling me to calm down, my old chap.
She wants 220 titty million quid and you tell me to calm down!
You're fired.
I'm not your lawyer.
Piss off!
I'm going to represent myself.
I'm not your lawyer.
You sit there, all confident.
Yeah?
But when this goes to Court, that's when the talking stops.
Mr. Reynholm, there might actually be more talking in Court, this would actually be a comparatively small amount of talking, what we're doing here.
- Oh, I see.
- Sorry.
No, that's all right, it's what I pay you for.
Look at her.
Cold as ice.
But I tell you this, behind those shades, she's terrified.
One thing you should know about me, Jen When I put my mind to something, it gets done.
Representing myself is the kind of challenge I relish.
Well, you'll have to do a lot of preparation.
Bring it on!
What's this?
It's my suit.
I made it myself.
Took me a few days!
How did you find time to prepare for the trial?
How did I what?
Mrs. Reynholm, you say that in the short time you were married, you became indispensable to Mr. Reynholm In what way were you indispensable?
I had to brush his teeth.
- Really?
- Yes.
- That's not an expression?
- No.
You got the brush, you applied toothpaste to it, you moved it into his mouth and moved your hand up and down.
Well, if I didn't do it, he wouldn't do it.
Make a note "brush teeth".
Now, you're asking for quite a large amount.
I think it is an appropriate amount.
Bollocks.
Mr. Reynholm.
Yes, your honour?
I would ask you to refrain from using that kind of language in my courtroom.
And which word in particular do you object to, your honour?
You only said one.
Could you read it back?
"Bollocks".
Don't read it back!
Why do you say it is an appropriate amount?
Mr. Reynholm caused me great distress.
I'm entitled to some restitution.
Besides, it's not as if he ever put the money to good use.
As the film proves.
Your honour, may I present the central exhibit to our case It is, I'm afraid, a sex tape.
A sex tape?
Which one?
The alien craft appears to have dropped its shields.
Thank you, Female Chekhov!
Female Sulu, beam their Captain aboard.
But Captain are you sure?
But she's hurt, she may need our help.
Jim, even if she's injured as you say, I can't do an examination on a new species without proper research.
Dammit, Jim, I'm a sexy doctor, not a sexy scientist!
Female Sulu.
You have your orders.
Perhaps the good doctor thinks certain alien species do not fall under the Hippocratic oath.
I have never refused treatment to a patient, Female Spock, and you know that!
I think we've seen enough.
Your Honour, I object!
There's a brilliant bit coming up.
Mr. Reynholm, are you ready to start your cross-examination of Mrs. Reynholm?
I am, your Honour, but rest assured, it will be a normal examination.
I am not in any way cross.
You are Victoria Reynholm, are you not?
Mr. Reynholm, we have already established that.
Might I suggest that you try less to do an impression of a lawyer you once saw on the television and make your case as simply as you possibly can.
Wise words, my learned lud.
Victoria, you've spoken about the real me, and I think it's time we heard a little about the real you.
Isn't it true, that you Used to be a man?
No.
It isn't true, you say?
It is untrue.
Who am I thinking of?
I think you mean April, the woman you had a fight with.
No further questions, my lud.
What?
Your entire case rested on that?
Yes, your Honour.
No, wait, Mr Reynholm, you can't leave it at that.
Your Honour, may I confer with my relationship manager?
What's up, Jen?
You've got to request more time to prepare a proper defence.
Your Grace, may I approach the bench?
- Have you brushed your teeth?
- No.
Then you may not.
Your Grace, I need to prepare a proper defence.
The one I just did there was rubbish.
Yes, he's some piece of work.
We're all very happy at Reynholm Industries.
- Are you telling the truth?
- Yes.
Then why are you so ill-at-ease?
Well If you must know I was in a court myself very recently This very courtroom in fact, where I gave testimony against a former soldier who I was having a massage and he kissed me on my bottom, Your Honour.
I see.
I'm sure you can understand my discomfort.
Are you all right?
Can you continue?
I can continue.
Thank you.
The way you tell it, your employer sounds like a paragon of virtue.
That's right.
And furthermore, I would like to say at this point that I think this whole case to be a damp squid.
Thank you, no further questions.
Oooh!
I have one more question, your Honour.
Yes?
What did you say?
What?
What did you say the case was?
May I have it read back please?
"I believe this entire case to be a bit of a damp squid".
"A damp squid"?
What does that mean?
Oh, Jen, it's an expression.
It means that I believe that everything that's been said in this case, everyone already knew.
Yes, but did you say "damp squid"?
That's right.
Did you not mean, "damp squib"?
No, it's "squid".
What's a squib?
It's not "squid".
Squids are already damp!
Hence the phrase!
Your Honour!
Please!
It is "squib".
I must say, I find it extraordinary that you, a man in your early 30s, could have reached this point in your life without knowing that it is "squib".
- I think it's "squid".
- I have no further questions.
- No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!
- That will be all.
- Everyone has a blind spot!
- I said that will be all!
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?
Sorry, bit nervous So Yeah Fizzy!
It's very fizzy.
It's fizzy.
Gone fizzy.
Ow, come on!
That's electric.
That's electric in there.
Just got a shock.
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?
It is not.
Sorry, yeah, sorry, sorry.
My mother sued me.
Relax.
Take your time.
Try to answer the questions as clearly as you can.
Thank you, my love.
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?
Chair.
It was the chair's fault.
No further questions, my lud.
Don't you have anything?
She's going to take you to the cleaners, Mr. Reynholm.
Yup, I suppose she will.
What's that?
Oh, God.
I think I may have found our miracle.
Can you state your full name, please?
Richmond Felicity Avenal.
And you worked at Reynholm Industries for a time?
I did, for over four years.
And what did you do?
I don't know.
Why did you leave?
Well, my life wasn't really going anywhere.
I was part of the whole goth/ death metal subculture but it wasn't making me happy.
It was all a bit gloomy.
It was round about that point that I developed scurvy.
Now that sounds unpleasant.
On the contrary.
Catching scurvy was the best thing that ever happened to me.
It made me take a long hard look in the mirror.
And I didn't like what I saw, I can tell you that.
Not just because my teeth had fallen out.
Which is why I founded From Goth2Boss.
Is it okay if I play a DVD?
Does it have anything whatsoever to do with this case?
Not really, Your Honour.
Then you may proceed.
Where are you going?
Is it to the top?
If not, why not?
Go to the bloody top!
Is it because you're a goth?
Did you know that goths have some of the lowest life satisfaction levels of any subculture with the exception of traffic wardens?
That's why you don't see any goth traffic wardens.
That would be a deadly combination!
We at Goth2Boss work with goths at various locations around the UK to bring out their hidden potential by encouraging them to engage in everyday, healthy pursuits such as sports.
Mixing with other humans.
Extended laughter sessions.
Introducing colour to your wardrobe.
Just look at these results.
This is Debbie.
She used to hang around railway stations with her hands in her sleeves.
Now she's a lifeguard in Mumbai!
From Goth2Boss, you know it makes sense.
Unless you're not a goth, in which case, from Goth2Boss.
Remember the name.
But what does that have to do with my divorce proceedings, m'kind fellow?
Well, Mr. Reynholm, I'm here to tell you that that woman is not Victoria Reynholm!
Her name is Melanie Crawford, a former From Goth2Boss pupil of mine!
Sing, you canary!
Well, during our sessions, she seemed more interested in you than getting better.
I don't think she ever truly exorcised the goth within.
Scratch away that fake tan and beneath you'll find the purest white foundation!
Yeah, that was more of a phrase than anything.
Oh, actually No sorry, that's not her!
Oh, sorry about that.
That's not her.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
You've heard a few things over the past few days, none of which cast me in a particularly favourable light.
Stories of expensive sex tapes, rumours of me killing my first wife.
No.
No-one's mentioned that.
You know, there's one thing I do want to say.
Just one thing, that I Mr. Reynholm?
Mr. Reynholm, please.
Mr. Reynholm, this really is the most pathetic display I have ever seen.
- May I say something, your Honour?
- Why not?
Lying here, pretending to have a heart attack, you see a desperate man.
Not pretending.
A man who has exhausted all of his time, all of his resources, on an expensive trial that has resulted in humiliation.
But think not of him.
Think of the employees of Reynholm Industries.
Think of the man who was sued by his mother.
The simpleton who thought the phrase "damp squid" was correct.
These are the people I want you to consider when making your judgment.
For Reynholm is not just the name of this ridiculous man who keeps opening his eyes whenever he thinks no-one's looking.
Reynholm is the name of the family his employees have found in each other.
We are all Reynholms.
Hurt him, and you hurt Oh, all right then, we'll take 70 million.
Hooray!
I'm getting oak.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1 Who owns the Infinity Gauntlet?
Thanos.
What was Thor's father's name?
Odin.
Sorry, Moss, I've really got to go.
Awww, just a few more, just a few more No, no, I'm sorry, you've done more than enough.
OK, all right, baby, see you later.
Bye-bye.
Wow!
Right?
That's an impressive knowledge of the Marvel universe.
I know.
Well, you've done it.
You've finally found a woman I can do business with.
Yeah, no, don't say things like that.
I'm sorry, I'm just so excited for us.
No If you don't go in all the way, it doesn't really count.
Hey, red!
Stand back, stand back, this one's mine.
I'm going to do everything for you, really nice.
Stand back, stand back, she's all mine.
It's tight.
You're so strong.
It's bubbling over.
It's on the house for you.
Oh, my God!
You inspire me.
Have a great day.
I will and you.
Thank you.
Ciao.
Moss, have you seen the video of the baby speaking French?
It went viral at 10:30, Roy, of course I've seen it.
I must have been in the toilet.
Ah, Jen, exciting news, I've just uploaded the second episode of my board games review show.
Care to have a look?
That was fast.
Seems like only yesterday that we had to sit through the last one.
It was three months ago, Jen.
Really?
It feels like it just happened.
Roy, did you hear that?
Moss has done his board game review show again.
I'm not watching that.
I'm not watching that again.
Jesus Christ, we don't have to watch it, do we?
We only sat through the first one the other day.
It was three months ago.
My God!
Wow, it feels like it just ended.
It was so boring!
It was like being insane, it was so insanely boring!
Roy's not a fan but you said you liked it.
Where did you get your coffee?
A new place.
Any good?
Really good.
You specifically said, and I quote, "You must show me the next one, Moss".
Did I?
Did I really?
My God!
Oh, if you'll excuse me, that'll be my lady love from the seventh floor.
That's going well?
Oh, yeah!
He's cock-a-hoop over this Sheila.
OK, so that'll be over soon, then.
Hey, I'll have you know that Alice is nuts about me.
She thinks that I'm emotionally artistic.
Well, what does that mean?
Erm, she said that emotionally I was on the artistic spectrum.
I think it means that I'm creative about my feelings, you know, more in tune with her wants and needs than most men.
Oh, she's rung out That keeps happening.
All right, if I'd said I'd watch it, then I suppose that's what I'm going to have to do.
That's the spirit, Jen.
Come on, let's get it over with.
Now, keep an open mind.
I know the first show was a bit "bare boned" but I think you'll really enjoy my new episode, or "webisode", if you prefer.
I don't prefer that, no-one does.
Come on, come on, sooner it starts, sooner it's over.

Board board board board Hello and welcome to Games Board.
Today on the show, we have So, guys I've been playing What's coming up on the show ..
guys?
I've I've been playing Ports of Essen.
A strategic trading game, where each player takes the role of a Danish fishing port merchant in the 16th century.
And for a change of pace, I've been looking at the expansion to Textile Merchant, Norfolk Edition.
Two games by Reiner Kiniksi?
Hold on to your hat, it's going to be a bumpy Let's talk about components.
Shouldn't we do rules before components?
It won't make any sense if we do it before the rules.
Don't forget to cut this conversation.
What?
Well, don't let the actual programme How long is this?
Even hearing it is bad.
I need to stop hearing it.
Sorry, Moss, I can't do it, it's unbearable.
Where are you going?
I'm jealous of your coffee.
You literally can't watch it?
I literally can't watch it.
So what can we do to make it better?
Well, I don't want to say anything that might hurt your feelings.
It's all right, I can take it, Jen.
I'm a big boy.
Well, as I say, it's slow, it's so slow.
OK, good, it is a bit slow, we can work on that.
And I guess the other thing is that it's terrible.
It's slow and terrible.
If a friend asked me to describe it, I'd say it's a slow, terrible thing on the internet, that I could only watch for a minute.
Is this helpful?
So helpful!
God!
Slow, terrible, could only watch it for a minute.
Wow, a lot to get our teeth stuck into there.
OK, well, let's see if I can help you with anything else.
Erm, none of you are any good in front of a camera.
None of us, yeah You've got really annoying voices.
The voices are a pain, yes.
And I guess that's because you haven't got any confidence.
No confidence.
I mean, if there's one thing you need, it's confidence.
It is confidence.
Absolutely.
Well, Jen, I can only thank you, once again And another thing I'm not listening any more!
Douglas, you're encourageable.
I'm encourageable?
You're Raymond Peterfellow, owner of the finest lap-dancing establishments in So-ho, if anyone's encourageable it's you, you perfumed porno vampire.
Perfumed porno vampire, I like that.
So you're thinking of having 500 of these travelling across London?
That's what I said.
Sexy and classy.
And that's difficult to pull off.
This will get people talking, all right.
Consider me one happy shareholder.
Right.
Oh, big party coming up on Thursday night, if you're up for it?
Damn, I'm supposed to be doing Secret Millionaire.
BLEEP it, I'll cancel.
I'll tell my assistant.
Hi, Joan.
Jen.
I'm not your assistant, Mr Reynholm.
I want you to cancel Secret Millionaire for me.
I'm not your assistant, wouldn't know who to call.
Just say anything, work your usual magic.
Not your assistant.
I am not your Oh, I'm sorry, I thought this was the toilet.
Didn't this used to be toilets?
Yes, I moved my office here to be closer to the ladies toilets.
Must get someone to take that sign down.
What's wrong with you, Ross?
Small mocha, please.
Small mocha, please.
Okey-dokey.
Or medium Yeah, you know what?
I've changed my mind, I think I'll have a medium.
So, you don't want a small one?
Small's fine, small is just as good, so I'll just Yes, that is what I'll have, I'll have a small mocha, my little man.
My good man.
OK, coming up.
Got it?
OK.
Fuck's sake.
Thank you for the virgin gin and tonic.
I suppose you could just call it tonic.
Yes.
So, Ross, how goes it in the world of computers?
Or PC world, if you will?
We're all very happy, thank you, Mr Reynholm.
Very happy indeed.
Forget this "we" malarky, I'm talking to you, Ross.
Are you happy?
Very happy, thank you, Mr Reynholm.
Look, I'm not your boss.
We're just a couple of guys, a couple of guys, shooting this shit, now tell me the truth.
Well, I suppose, sometimes I do feel I lack a little confidence.
I know, it's silly.
No, I've just realised what a funny voice you have.
Now, Ross, I'm going to tell you something.
Confidence is a confidence trick.
Look at me, what do you see?
A man who inherited his father's successful business.
Wasn't that successful.
It was pretty successful.
A lot more successful than it is now, that's for sure.
All right, all right, just say the right thing.
Say the thing I want you to say.
Say, "A confident man", say "A confident man".
A confident man.
I wasn't always this way.
There was a time when I was just like you.
But then I discovered the secret.
And, Ross, I'm going to tell you what that secret is but you must keep it to yourself.
I will take my ears to the grave.
Two words.
Women's slacks.
I'm sorry?
Women's slacks.
Women's slacks?
Yes.
I'm wearing women's slacks.
You're wearing women's slacks?
Yes.
That's nothing like what I thought you were going to say.
Is it not?
It is not.
I thought you were going to give me a book recommendation, or something.
Book recommendation?
I can't read.
No, I don't know what it is, but women's slacks give me the confidence I need to survive in a tough business world.
They're lighter, airier and less constricted than men's trousers and I'm pretty sure it doesn't make me a transvestite.
Look at that shit, look at it.
I can't How am I supposed to It looks like he milked a cow over it.
You're so fussy about coffee.
It's very annoying.
It's ruined.
He ruined my coffee.
Don't just chuck it like that.
That fellow shouldn't be allowed to be a barista.
Why not?
Because he's too small, Jen.
He's clearly too small to be a barista.
What?
You're being a bit of a small person racist, Roy.
A small person racist?
That's not a thing.
You can't have tiny baristas, Jen.
For God's sake, the man works with steam.
I'm going to have to have a word with him.
Have a word with him?
That's right.
About his height?
I think he'd appreciate the feedback.
About his height?
That's not what people do, Roy.
Well, I'm not people, Jen, and I think that's a good thing.
I'm not afraid to cut through the bullshit.
I bet this is exactly what Alison was talking about.
Autistic.
She said, "Autistic".
That's what happened.
No, I don't think so.
There is no artistic spectrum.
But she's so Did she say it during an argument, by any chance?
She did say it during a She did say it You know what was weird, was we were having quite a big argument and then suddenly, out of nowhere, she paid me that lovely compliment.
Hey, baby.
Oh, oh, good, good, yes.
Sure, yeah, I'd love to.
Yes, OK, well I'll see you there.
What?
Why?
No.
Hello?
Alice?
That was weird.
What?
OK, so, what the hell is that?
So she tells me that her grandfather died, she wants me to go to the funeral.
I say that I'd be delighted, and then she hangs on me.
Her grandfather's funeral?
Yeah.
That's what you were just talking about just there.
That's right.
You sounded like you were being invited to Glastonbury.
Oh, funerals are sad.
You did not sound sad.
I wasn't concentrating.
Emotionally artistic?
You're emotionally colour-blind, that's what you are.
Maybe I am emotional colour-blind.
I was about to confront that little man.
I know.
I was going to give him shit about his height.
Glad you realise now how inappropriate that would've been.
I'll just leave him a note.
I'm here on purpose.
Oh, yes.
I'm interested in women's slacks.
I see.
I'd like Sorry.
Hot ear.
I'd like to buy a pair of women's slacks.
For me, not for a woman.
Oh, yes, well, that shouldn't be a problem.
I'm not trying to look like a woman.
I understand.
I'm not a confident man.
Quite.
Well, let's see what we can do for you.
I don't know about this.
Oh, just ask them, Jen.
Me and Juan, we have a thing.
I don't want another splashy-splashy coffee from the teeny-tiny coffee man.
Poor woman.
No, no, no, don't give her money.
You're not supposed to do that.
I'm actually a person, Roy, with human feelings.
I'm sorry, I thought you were I don't know what to do.
Here's Â£5.
Do you want Â£5?
I don't know if you want money.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What happened?
Never mind, just go.
What do you think?
I think you just sold a brother some slacks.
Help, help, get off me!
Let go.
You're a bully.
Need to save that old woman, but I have no confidence.
Hey!
Thank you.
Hey, come, come, no queue for you.
Come on.
Hello, Juan.
I'm with her.
It must be my birthday.
I get to see you twice so quick.
Back again.
Same as usual, please.
Could I ask you a huge favour and ask you to make Roy's coffee for him, too?
I've been going on and on about you.
And I like what I heard.
Would that be OK?
Would you mind?
Of course, anything for you, my sweet.
OK.
Slippery fingers.
It's all right.
It's not all right.
Look, it looks like me with a beard.
I don't want this.
It's horrible.
Oh, my God!
I didn't mean to.
I don't hate you.
None of this is on purpose.
What can I do?
Let me give you some money.
Here's Â£10.
Oh, my God!
I'm not with her.
Oi!
Oi!
Did you write this comment?
What?
No.
You've got a problem with smaller people?
I don't have a problem with small people, OK?
I don't.
I just don't want you making my coffee.
Because you're bad at it.
You're bad at making coffee.
You're too small.
You're too small to make good coffee.
You know what?
Up yours.
No!
Little man, watch out!
It's being called the viral video of the year.
A woman throws her coffee onto a tramp and then a man has an argument with a small barista.
You're just too small.
The barista goes to cross the road and is hit by a van with breasts.
The woman who's been dubbed by various online commentators as Coffee Tramp Toss Bitch has not been identified, while the man known as Small Person Racist was also Small people are not a race.
This isn't Game Of Thrones.
They're actually calling me a bitch on the news.
What the hell happened there?
How did you find out it was us?
It's all here in the weekly surveillance report.
What's going on, Joan?
I expect better from my assistant.
I'm not your assistant.
My name isn't Joan.
What's your beef with the homeless?
I don't have any homeless beef.
Ah, so it's women you hate.
Well, that I can understand.
Whoa, whoa, you record our e-mails and tape our phone calls?
All right, dry your eyes, Bono.
If you've nothing to hide, you've nothing to fear.
It wasn't my fault Mr Renholm.
I would never throw coffee over a homeless woman.
I would never abuse a small person, certainly not enough to make a van with tits hit him.
Although, I suppose I sort of did.
I sort of did my one, too.
It's frustrating that we did both of our things.
Yes, it is.
All right, spare me.
I was young once, but if this gets out, this could deeply damage Renholm Industry's ability to make that product that we make.
What do you want us to do, Mr Renholm?
Don't do anything.
Stay out of trouble and remain there.
There are places lower than the basement.
Stop worrying, Jen.
Nobody can make us out in that video.
It's just like early footage of happy slapping.
Just relax.
I can't relax.
It's all right for you.
I have plans.
I want to get up there.
I will not be a social piranha.
A what, now?
Jim, take a look at this.
What is it?
It's the new-look game board.
200,000 views?
I know.
It's a bit different.
Check it out.
Game board.
Shut the fridge.
It's Game board.
BLEEP game board.
Say what?
Wow!
You all seem different somehow.
Yes.
We're all wearing women's trousers.
Oh.
Right.
Hey, what's going on?
Let's get the game board.
He is Newton Sinclair.
This guy is Roger Booth.
And I guess I'm still Maurice Moss.
Are you wearing your trousers now?
I couldn't wear them all the time, Jen - I'd have a heart attack.
No, they're safely locked away in my fortress of solitude.
It's funny - when I wear them, I'm a dynamo.
A young Leonard Kravitz, people hanging off my every word.
And then as soon as I take them off, I'm just back to being the same She's gone, hasn't she?
She's gone.
She went quite a while ago.
Yeah.
Oh, Michael Buble's here.
No, no, it's a funeral, Moss.
I have to go to this funeral for Alice's grandfather and I'm not looking forward to it.
Funerals are pain in the crack.
Even in the best of circumstances, they're no picnic, but now I've got Alice on my arse, like the emotion police.
I'm going to have to look convincingly sad for the majority of the day.
She's not going to expect me to cry, is she?
No.
What if she does?
I can't cry on cue.
What do I do then?
Do what I do when I need to cry.
Use a mild pepper-spray solution.
Now that makes sense.
See?
That makes more sense than having to feel something.
Do you have any of that stuff here?
Why do you think we have a mini-fridge?
Good evening.
You've got quite a lot of it.
I suppose I have made quite a lot of it.
And what's in here?
Just Tabasco, wasabi and a bit of tear gas.
Those sound like bad things to put in your eyes.
It's extremely mild.
It's mainly water.
OK, I'll take it as a last resort.
As a last resort?
In case I find myself out of my emotional death.
There you go.
All right.
Thanks, Moss.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, don't forget to add the water.
Oh, poor Pip Pop.
Sorry, what?
Pip Pop We always called him Pip Pop because he was so short.
All of my family on that side are really short.
Is that right?
Oh Oh, Alice.
Shh Oh!
Roy, are you all right?
Holy!
Yeah, it just really hurts.
Oh, darling.
Oh, it hurts.
I know.
I know.
Oh Oh, Christ, why is this happening?
'Will we ever find out just who this person was?
'Unfortunately, with current technology we can't depixelate 'the picture, so it's very unlikely we'll ever find out 'the identity of this dreadful ginger cow.
' Oh, are you still crying?
I don't seem to be able to stop.
One of the pallbearers wasn't able to make it.
Oh Look, I know this is a bit weird.
Do you mind stepping in?
I'm happy to.
I mean, I'm certainly happy to.
Yeah, that's fine.
That's fine.
Hi, thanks so much for helping us out.
No problem.
Hey!
Hello.
Oh, there's another one.
Hi.
Have you seen the pallbearers?
Yeah.
So you guys and me, we are going to carry the coffin together?
Yes.
We are going to put the casket on our collective shoulders and walk in a straight line with it?
No, it didn't go well, Jen.
It didn't go well at all.
I mean, thanks for asking, but no, it wasn't a success.
It wasn't a successful funeral for me.
It didn't have the required gravitas.
Gravitas?
No, no.
It wasn't very dignified.
It wasn't dignified at all, Jen.
If I had to pick a word to describe Pip Pop's final journey to the grave, it would be "funny".
It was so funny, Jen.
Of course, I tried not to laugh and I tried to put other things in my head, but every step that we took was a fresh reminder of just how funny the whole thing was!
You didn't laugh, did you?
I laughed my hole off.
I can't believe she's still with you.
I suppose, but, I mean, I'm hanging on by a thread, Jen.
I think I'll just get through it as long as nothing else bad happens.
There's the phone now.
'The new footage has led to the pair being identified, 'Jen Barber and Roy Trenneman, both employees at Reynholm Industries.
' What the hell were you thinking?
I told you to keep a low profile and you do it again!
No, no, no, no, no, it's new footage, Mr Reynholm.
Bum your excuses!
Reynholm Industries has a reputation to uphold.
We're not News International, for Christ's sake!
I'm going to have to do Secret "Pissing" Millionaire now just to undo your damage!
And I'm missing out on a massive party!
You're no longer my assistant.
I'm furious.
And I'll tell you something else, when I return from the estate, it's ..
for you.
Oh Oh!
Hello, hey, baby.
Oh, yeah, of course.
No, absolutely.
All right, OK.
Bye-bye.
She left you?
She did.
Yeah.
As the identities of Coffee Toss Tramp Bitch and Small Person Racist are finally revealed, we at Channel 4 News ask, "What the hell is wrong with people"?
I've got a lot of new followers on Chitter.
Loads more followers, yeah.
They're all very abusive.
They wish we were dead.
Wait.
What?
Chitter.
We can use Chitter to explain ourselves.
Yeah.
Chitter is the perfect place to explain a complex situation.
I know that.
"I didn't mean to throw coffee on that woman.
"I didn't know she was there.
"I went back to try and find her but" Oh Too many characters.
Too many characters.
Got it.
"Hate the homeless.
"And I suppose I hate women, too?
"LOL".
Send.
Whoa.
You didn't just send that, did you?
Yes.
That didn't sound so good.
People get the sense of it, that's the thing about Chitter.
It's best if you're conversational and off-the-cuff.
Here it is.
Oh You didn't put a question mark after the first sentence.
You don't need to use proper grammar on Chitter.
What you've Chitted here, Jen, is, "Hate the homeless and I suppose I hate women, too.
LOL".
Phew, I'm glad all that's over.
You're too small, you're just too small!
You're too small, too small, too small 'Which then leads to him being hit by a van with tits.
' And now Anonymous are after us.
Well, that's just ideal.
Oh, a bunch of nerds sitting at their computer, what can they do?
We pissed off the Internet, Jen.
The Internet is coming to get us!
Well, let's get I before IT gets us.
What are you?
Oh, I don't want Anonymous after me.
I am inanonymous I think.
Let's hide it.
What?
The Internet.
Oh Because we told you that was the Internet?
Yes.
We never told you it wasn't the Internet?
No.
Well, the thing is, Jen that's not the Internet.
What's Jen doing with the Internet?
We're not doing that.
Oh Cricket!
Right, don't be scared, yeah.
We're all friends here.
Tell Dougie your story?
OK, but who is he again?
I'm just your average social worker.
Yes, just in the area having a look around.
Please just pretend I'm not here.
Do you ever have anyone come round and help you and stuff?
Granddad, sometimes.
He's hardly around.
What about your dad?
He's never around, either Sorry, my friend, I need to stop you there.
I must take this.
Reynholm What?
Well, increase the bid.
I don't care what I said the ceiling was.
I want that artwork by Madonna.
Now, 22 million is the minimum but I'm happy to go to 50.
In fact, make 50 the new minimum.
Yes, yes.
I can't talk right now.
I'm doing Secret Millionaire.
That's very sad.
Do you want to shut up, we're filming Secret Millionaire.
Check your privilege.
How am I finding it so far?
To be honest with you, it's not as god-awful as I thought it would be.
People have been terribly nice.
They're actually quite clean.
I have been invited to a party this evening.
The last party I ever went to was when Elton John's dog had a baby.
I tell a lie.
The last party I went to was when Conrad Black got arrested.
Conrad Black, who's that?
Oh, no-one, just an old friend.
Let's get in there.
Yeah, sure.
So I thought with Game Board's increased viewership, perhaps it would be a good place to put my side of the story and show the world I'm not the monster I'm currently supposed to be.
Boo!
Boo!
Don't boo, please.
That is a horrible T-shirt.
So the question everyone is asking, Jen Barber, do you hate women?
Oh Thank you, Jen Barber.
Coming up, what was it like to be a 14th-century grain merchant?
Wait, I don't know if that was clear.
Sorry, it's these trousers.
They make me want to move onto the next item.
It's better broadcasting and the slacks know it!
Coming up.
Will you stop saying, "Coming up".
Next I don't know if they got my point!
Oh, gosh!
Oh!
Oh, gosh.
Richmond, do you work here or not?
I don't get paid, but I like to come in.
So that Goth thing didn't work out?
Does it look like it worked out?
Anyway, how have you guys been?
Everyone thinks I'm a misogynist.
Roy lost his girlfriend because he's emotionally colour-blind and Moss is wearing trousers that make him good at telly.
Any gossip?
What's going on with you?
Oh, you know, keeping busy, voice-over work mainly.
Really, how did that happen?
Someone just noticed I had a beautiful voice.
Oh, Richmond.
Things aren't going well at all.
Just get in there.
It's just not the same when you guys aren't together.
Anyway, if you want me, you know where I am.
I don't, though, Richmond.
Don't lurk!
Where did he go?
Where did who go?
Does it ever seem to you that the things that happen to us are sort of strange?
How so, Roy?
Well remember when I had to pretend to be disabled and I ended up in Manchester?
That wasn't a normal thing to happen, was it?
Or when you ended up spending the night in that arcade machine.
That was odd.
I suppose those were unusual events.
And this is strange.
What's happening to us right now is strange, isn't it?
Well, at least, it'll all be over soon.
Douglas is bound to fire us when he gets back.
Come on, guys, this isn't us.
Are we just going to sit here and take it?
What do we normally do when we get into a scrape?
We normally make things worse and worse and then it ends.
No, we don't.
We stick together.
That doesn't sound like us.
OK, enough Come on, who are we?
Who are we?
I want to hear you say it!
We're the IT We're the IT ..
Department.
You're goddamn right we are!
Are you wearing women's slacks?
Yes, I am.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Let's get into a car and cruise around.
How to get into a car?
Smash a window.
Great idea.
That's the one.
I'm such an idiot.
I've got a robot hand.
Hang on a second.
This is MY car.
Oh, shit.
Wow-wow-wow.
It's all right, everyone, be cool.
I'll handle this.
Take that.
It's all right, Officer, I'm doing Secret Millionaire.
Come on, come on, come on, people.
What's going on?
Come on, come on, come on, people.
How long has he been wearing the trousers?
He won't take them off.
OK, come on, come on, come on What's going on, what's going on?
We don't know what's happening.
OK, come on.
To every problem, there's a solution.
What's our problem here?
What's our problem?
Everyone thinks I'm a cow who hates women.
You're a cow.
Terrible cow.
Women, OK.
Roy, hurt me.
Erm, the woman I love thinks that I hate small people.
Small people, thank you, Roy.
I'm probably going to die alone in front of computer pornography?
I'll just draw a sad face.
OK, so what do women and small people both like?
What do they both like?
Chairs.
Films.
I really don't know.
I'll tell you.
It's just they seem like very different groups.
Very different groups.
Not being attacked.
They both love not being attacked.
Well, I can't speak for small people, obviously, but as a woman, I certainly like not being attacked.
Where are you going with this, Moss?
I'll tell you exactly where I'm going with this, Roy.
I'm saying that we use this brief window, while Douglas is away, to produce a pepper-spray solution for small women, using that stuff I gave Roy earlier.
That sounds really weird.
Jen Barber, not a hater of women but their defender, their champion.
I love it now.
And I can do a massive presentation.
A self-defence pepper spray for small women suits my purposes also.
It will show Alice that I care and, as a woman with small relatives, she's sure to come to Jen's presentation.
You know, when I first stocked that mini-fridge with pepper-spray solution, I thought I'd made too much but only now do I realise that I'd made exactly the right amount for our current purposes.
It almost seems like it's too good an idea.
You see what we can do when we work together?
With my business acumen My scientific know-how And I'm also here We can do anything!
Yes!
Yes!
I need a trouser break.
You coming, Roy?
I can't seem to get the wording of this speech to Alice right.
You're doing a speech?
Yeah, I need to show her that I'm not emotionally colour-blind.
I'm actually a very sensitive human man, and she needs to know that.
Oooh, what's a more romantic word for "knockers"?
A MORE romantic word?
Come on, guys.
Let's protect women!
I'll meet you up there.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Eartha Kitts!
Right, is everything ready?
Yeah, well, I've got the posters up and I've put gift bags with pepper spray beside each chair.
Now, I think it was a master stroke to put the spray in these elegant bottles.
Why not look stylish while you defend yourself?
Something's bothering me, though.
Are we missing something that's very obviously wrong with this idea?
I really don't think so.
Oh, look, here comes everyone.
Hello, and welcome to this very special presentation for women by a woman, me a woman, who loves women.
By your seats you'll find a gift bag, and in that gift bag you'll find our very exciting new product.
No, don't do that.
No, you're not supposed to Yes!
I have some things I have to say to you!
No, I need to go.
No, you are going nowhere.
Now, I know in the past that you have accused me of being emotionally colour-blind.
Shut up and listen.
But now I've changed - my sight is perfect.
Now I know what was wrong with the idea.
With your sweet lips and, of course, your lovely bangers, I know you're the one for me.
I'm in terrible pain.
Me, too, Alice, me, too, but that ends now.
It ends now.
That could not have gone better.
Oh, no, Roy, that didn't go well at all.
Oh, right, because we're going to lose our jobs.
Argh!
Mr Reynholm So, that's the thing.
I gave the boy the can of lager, so technically I'm guilty of corrupting a minor.
So it's the reason why I bought the tramp uniform and I've had to make myself scarce.
So, you need somewhere to hide out?
Yeah, somewhere off-piste.
Somewhere where no-one will find you.
Bottom of the world.
You can use our office if you'd like.
Whoo.
Well, I'll need someone to take care of business upstairs.
We're not doing anything.
Well, this is perfect.
My wonderful assistant, Joan, and her two friends, Ross.
I'm going to go and piss around on the internet but actually I'll need some food.
I've already eaten one of the toys in here.
Did he just say what I think he said?
I wasn't really listening.
Is this Is what's happening good now?
Is this good?
Yes, it's a very good outcome.
Oh, my God!
I think we've come out on top, I can't believe it.
We've come out on top.
'Jen Barber.
' Oh, I forgot about you.
Oh, God, that's impressive.
They're actually watching us.
Hey, mate, am I an anonymous?
Silence, you person wasters.
Greetings, Jen Barber.
This is your sentence.
You've been found guilty of the most appalling lack of basic human kindness and decency.
Come in.
Shush, you.
Peter, what are you doing in there?
Shut up!
You've been there for hours.
I'm doing something.
Go away!
Peter, your mum and I are worried about you.
Get out.
You need to get off this computer.
Who is this?
Are these your friends?
I'm sorry.
Peter can't play any more.
He's coming outside.
'You said I could stay here as long as I wanted.
' We said that you had to come out.
'..
do my homework 'I've done my homework 'I know my rights' This internet's not working.
I can't connect.
Just try turning it off and on again.
Thanks, Ross.
Reynholm Industries is changing.
New opportunities, new faces, a new direction.
A better workplace environment.
Exciting new products.
An inclusive hiring policy I am sounding happy?
Can you be a little bit more Yeah, this is me being happy.
Just be a bit more, I don't know I'm being upbeat.
No, I just want you to speak Ah, forget it, let's just stop.
