{START OF EPISODE 1}
Fore!
Here they come!
- I don't hear nothin'.
- Wait for it.
Attention, all personnel.
Report immediately to admitting ward and operating room.
Attention, all personnel.
Report immediately to admitting ward and operating room.
This guy's got a rapid pulse!
He's in shock!
Get him down to O.R. and give him first aid!
Let's go!
Dear Dad.
Hawkeye here.
You said I sounded a bit callous about my job in my last letter.
Well, let me see if I can put it another way.
At this particular mobile army hospital, we're not concerned with the ultimate reconstruction of the patient.
We only care about getting the kid out of here alive enough for someone else to put on the fine touches.
We work fast and we're not dainty, because a lot of these kids who can stand two hours on the table just can't stand one second more.
We try to play par surgery on this course.
Par is a live patient.
- Clamp.
- Clamp.
I'll debride the wound, then we'll go in after the spleen, okay?
Dish, clean that up for us, will you?
Put some suction on that.
- Give me a clamp.
- Clamp.
Wanna play a little "doctor" after we're finished?
- Hurry.
I think we're losing him.
- Scissors.
Hey, Red, give us a little cross action here.
Put in a fix, will ya?
- Everything under control?
- Uh, yeah, fine.
But if you don't move, I'm gonna have to cut around your " B" cups.
I don't want a Kelly clamp, Lieutenant!
- But that's what you asked for.
- Give me what I want, not what I asked for!
Hey, Ginger, put a clamp on his mouth.
You can show us all your diploma later, Frank.
- That's enough, Captain.
- Oh, clever.
I can see well enough.
Now give me a sponge.
- I can't see a thing in here.
- Give me the retractor.
- Let me have a clamp.
- Which retractor?
- The biggest one you got.
- Get your seams straight.
Give me a clamp.
- Pierce!
- Hi.
Pierce, hold on!
Oh, lay off, Frank.
I just had a hard day at the office.
Your conduct in there was not only unbecoming of an officer, it was equally reprehensible as a medical man!
Frank, I happen to be an officer only because I foolishly opened an invitation from President Truman to come to this costume party.
And as for my ability as a doctor, if you seriously question that, I'm afraid I'll just have to challenge you to a duel.
Swords or pistols?
I was thinking of specimen bottles at 20 paces.
There are ladies present.
- Oh, sorry, baby.
- Major to you.
Oh, sorry, major baby.
You're both a disgrace to this outfit.
Aw, come on, Frank!
We've all had 12 straight hours of meatball surgery in there!
My brain is sending me urgent rest telegrams.
You must be tired, too, after all that malpractice you put in.
- You're dismissed!
- Thanks, Mother.
We gotta get up early anyway and fix MacArthur's hernia.
Come on, Mary.
Some nurse this guy had.
- Oh, yeah.
Was that the one with the- - Yeah, right.
The one I was tellin' you about.
Hi, Ho-Jon.
She came to me once with a sore throat.
She didn't mind my examining her tonsils, but she didn't understand why she had to take off her clothes.
- That's a woman all over.
- Best place for 'em to be.
Here.
Night, guys.
I've left a call for 1967.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, Ho-Jon.
All right.
Thanks.
- Ah.
Finest kind.
-Just like Mother used to make.
You know, we gotta do it someday.
Throw away all the guns, and invite all the jokers from the north and the south in here to a cocktail party.
Last man standing on his feet at the end wins the war.
You guys got mail.
That's Hawkeye.
Trapper.
I don't feel like mail.
Go ahead, open it.
They can't draft you again.
Bad news from my wife.
She still loves me.
Would you believe this?
She still thinks I got sent to Korea as part of some secret plot to cheat on her.
- Well, didn't you?
- Yeah, but how did she figure it out?
Hey, Ho-Jon!
Come here.
Sit down.
I got a letter from Dean Lodge.
- Is that a good place to stay?
- Ha-ha.
He's the head of my alma mater.
Listen to this.
"Dear Hawkeye, as dean of the college, I naturally remember you very well.
" After my first autopsy, I mailed him a nervous system.
"Your request to enter the Korean boy, Ho-Jon, "seems one of your nobler gestures, "and since his academic record meets our requirements, "we will be pleased to accept him this fall, "provided you can get him here "and also send me $1,000 tuition before the 15th.
"It was good hearing from you.
"If you do to the army what you did to this college, America is finished.
Yours sincerely-" Etcetera, etcetera.
- Hot dog!
- Hey, that's terrific.
How can I ever thank you?
You just go back there and become the best possible you you can.
- I go tell my folks.
- Okay.
Where are we gonna get a thousand dollars?
It's more like 2,000, you know, with transportation and clothing and everything.
He can stay with my parents, so there's no problem there.
Maybe we could sell Spearchucker while he's asleep.
There must be something we can sell.
What does everybody want here?
What- What do all these people want more than anything else?
To go home or, uh, Tokyo, whichever comes first.
- What do they really want?
- Sex.
- Ahh.
- 'Cept for those baseball perverts.
All right, we'll have Radar print up some tickets, and you make up a sign.
Mind tellin' me what we're gonna put on the sign?
"All you can drink, ten bucks a head.
"Giant door prize: weekend pass for two in Tokyo.
" Lucky winner to share the company of a gorgeous nurse.
" You wanna raffle off a nurse?
Is that what I said?
Yes, sir?
Radar!
Radar, don't do that.
Yes, sir.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Yes, but let me say I want to see you before I see you.
Yes, sir.
You wanted to see these, sir?
- How did you know that?
- That's why you called me.
Oh, yeah.
- You wanted me to take those, sir.
- Yeah.
Captains Pierce and Mclntyre to see you, sir.
Show them in.
Men.
- How are ya, Henry?
- How are ya, Henry?
That's not what you guys came to ask.
I mean, the last thing you wanna know when you say, " How are you"?
is how am I. All right, Henry, let's skip the gristle and get right down to the bone.
Now, what we want from you is two weekend passes so we can raise this tuition.
See, what we wanna do is raffle them off, along with the company of one of our nurses whose heart and everything else is in the right place.
Seems like a good enough cause.
Why don't I trust you guys?
- 'Cause we're not trustworthy.
- Yeah.
Yeah, maybe that's it.
How do I know you're on the level?
Which nurse have you conned into doing this?
Well, I haven't approached her yet, but there could be only one choice.
A girl with a face that doesn't quit.
A girl with so much body, she should be continued on the next girl.
- Lieutenant Dish.
- Lieutenant Dish.
- Lieutenant Dish will never agree to this.
- Oh, but she will.
Because inaccessible as she is to everybody else in this cruddy outfit, she's putty in the hands of the master.
Hawkeye, that makes me crazy.
My lips were made by Stradivarius.
Dish, I have to ask you a favor.
How many times must I tell you?
I'm engaged!
I'm engaged too.
Think of me as a dress rehearsal.
Always sneaking up on me!
- Who sneaks up on you?
- Psst.
You really thrive on rejection.
Hawkeye, I'm trying to be faithful.
A girl can only take so much.
Are we anywhere near that point yet?
You said you wanted a favor.
Yeah, I'll tell you after I finish my lunch.
Sickening.
Animals.
Here's $10 for Radar's ticket.
Ten dollars for the Painless Pole.
And $10 for the winning ticket.
You walk off with this raffle, we're gonna be able to sell tickets to your lynching.
Don't worry about it.
How are we doin'?
Oh, around 600.
We're a little short, you know.
Oh, well, we haven't given everybody a chance to contribute.
- What are you doin' to Frank's gear?
- Selling nickel-nose a ticket.
I know he wouldn't mind if he were alive today.
What are you doin' there?
I just wanted to borrow your Bible, Frank.
Since when are you interested in the Bible?
I peeked at the end, Frank.
The devil did it.
Shut up!
You get off of there.
Don't get physical, Frank.
You'll blow your sainthood.
I've had just about as much as I can stand from you two, between your snide remarks and your corruption of Ho-Jon and your-your-your turning this place into a brothel!
- Hey, whoa!
- Wait a minute!
And a distillery!
Frank, I'm tellin' ya.
You drop that gin mill and your head's gonna go in the shop.
Oh.
Um, listen, guys.
I didn't know it was gonna break.
- Oh, that's okay.
- It's all right, Frank.
Don't worry about it.
Don't give it another thought.
-  - I thought he'd never leave.
Henry, you have no idea what it's like to share a tent with a guy who thinks he's all 12 disciples.
Be that as it may, if I don't do something about this, Frank'll report it to Hammond, and he'll put my butt in traction!
And get your feet off my desk!
So I'm withdrawing the weekend passes.
You can forget about the party and raffle business tomorrow night.
Henry, that's pretty regular army of you, isn't it?
It's just as well.
I have to go down and see Hammond in Seoul for a few days, and I wasn't any too happy about the party taking place in my absence.
Happy days are here again What's this?
It's the weekend passes for the raffle.
When did he sign these?
When he thought he was ordering a ton of ice cream.
Fudge ripple.
Happy days are here again   Attention, all personnel.
Both day and night shifts will be confined to duty in the admitting ward tomorrow night.
All other activities are cancelled.
There will be no exceptions.
By order of the acting commanding offiicer, Major Frank Burns.
- Captain, put that down!
- #Happy days are here a-## What do you say, buddy?
Morning, Frank.
- Morning.
- Hey, Frank, I'm glad you got here.
You wanna hear something really wild?
Come here.
What's the matter, Frank?
Frank's a little groggy.
Yes.
He needs a little rest.
He's been so tense.
Sometimes rest is the best medicine.
There you go, Frank.
-  -  What's that, Frank?
-  - Okay, Frank.
Now let's see that this patient gets all the rest he so badly needs.
I say he should be sedated every hour on the hour.
-  -##    Oh, you look good.
Hiya, Ho-Jon.
Hi.
Thank you.
You still haven't told me how I get out of going away with the winner.
And why do I get the funny feeling it's gonna be you?
You don't trust me.
Not since the first time I found you hiding in my sleeping bag.
May I have this shuffle?
- Excuse me!
- Oh!
Excuse me!
Father.
Captain Pierce!
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
My dance card's all full.
- Where is he?
- Who?
You know very well who.
Major Burns!
He's been missing for hours!
- Oh, I thought you'd heard.
- Heard what?
Frank's gone over to the enemy.
They offered him $100 more a week and a royalty on bedpans.
When I find him, you'll be under arrest!
It doesn't bother me.
My spies tell me three companies of Canadians attacked Hill 55 about an hour ago.
By midnight, this place'll be flooded with casualties.
Personally, I don't plan to work if I'm busted.
Well, you tell that to Major Burns.
Look, Hot Lips- Why don't you stop worrying about Elmer Gantry?
Grab yourself a partner and give him a dancing physical.
Excuse me!
- Excuse me!
- You will live dangerously.
What could she do to us?
General Hammond, please.
Tell him it's Major Houlihan.
Major Margaret Houlihan from Fort Benning.
Major Houlihan?
Excuse me.
Don't get up.
Yes, sir.
Frank?
Frank?
Okay, okay.
Calm down, everybody.
First of all I want to announce that, because of your generosity and thirst, we raised over And that means that Ho-Jon's college career is off to a flying start!
Go, team!
Fight, team!
Yea, team!
Put that man in traction.
The next thing I wanted to tell you is to get out your raffle tickets, because this is when the whole thing hits the fan.
Frank!
And now, the incomparable Lieutenant Dish.
Star of stage, screen and radiology, will dip her sensuous claw into the bowl and pick the lucky winner.
Here it is, ladies and germs, the name of the fortunate man who will spend a glorious weekend for two in Tokyo with the completely edible Lieutenant Dish.
And the winner is FatherJohn P. Mulcahy!
Ten-hut!
It- Do I understand that the priest of this outfit has just won a weekend with a nurse in Tokyo?
- It's a prayer come true.
- Who are you?
Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce.
Who are you, Sarge?
What do you think this star means?
You're Tinkerbell?
This is Brigadier General Hammond, Chief Medical Offiicer of the Seoul Sector!
Oh, hi.
Which one here's Mclntyre?
Yo!
You and Pierce are both under arrest.
I'd like to get a second opinion on that.
What's the charge, General?
Breaking orders by having this party.
- And handing out unauthorized passes!
-  -  - The mummy strikes!
Major Burns, sir- - Hamilton.
- Hot Lips.
- Hot Lips?
- Hot Lips?
Those two!
They're ruining this war for all of us!
Get your M.P.'s, Henry.
On the double!
Come on, Henry.
You two are going to be court-martialed.
- In Tokyo?
- San Francisco?
Right here is where you'll be tried, and right here is where you'll serve your time.
Now get moving.
You're under arrest.
- I'm afraid we can't do that, General.
- No.
It's a good idea, though.
I'd do the same thing in his place.
- You can't do what?
- Listen!
- What?
- Wait for it.
Those helicopters you're about to hear are gonna be filled with Canadians who went to a different party tonight.
- - Without us, a lot of those kids are not getting home.
Attention, all personnel.
Report immediately to admitting ward and operating room.
General, look.
Hey, you can put us in the clink after.
But right now we got a job to do and we're a little shorthanded around here, and we can use all the help we can get.
By the way, how are your hands?
- Steady?
- No.
Dirty nails.
Come on.
Let's get ready, men.
I got it.
There it is.
I see it.
Okay, let me have the suture.
Suture.
Come on.
Let's go.
Good girl.
- Suture.
Sponge.
- Okay, we got it.
Well, I haven't put in a stretch like that for years, Henry.
Makes you remember what you're all about, doesn't it?
Radar!
- Yes, sir!
- Damn it, Radar!
How many times- Yes, sir.
I've alerted the General's pilot.
He's ready to take off.
Now, I want you to alert the General's pilot to be ready to take off at any time.
- And that's an order.
- Henry.
Those two maniacs are the best surgeons I've ever seen.
Made me feel like a horse doctor in there.
Now make sure you don't lose 'em, not even to me.
Yes, sir.
You're not leaving now, are you, sir?
I've got to get back to the base, Henry.
- Oh, I was hoping to give you a box of your favorite- - Cigars.
- Cigars.
- Oh.
Thank you, Henry.
Don't forget what I said.
Hey, where's he goin'?
We're all set.
Forget it.
He was too impressed to have you arrested.
We did it again- screwed up in reverse.
I keep telling you, we gotta give up this preoccupation with keeping people alive, or we'll never get outta here.
- It's no use.
We're doomed.
- Maybe we should start using rusty instruments.
- Stop washing our hands.
- Raise our prices.
Hey.
Hi, there.
I couldn't help noticing you in the operating room.
Great the way you did- What do you mean, it's too early in the morning?
Hey, I liked your work with the sponge this morning.
Terrific.

{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
You know, we got a big man here.
This guy's a two-star general.
Yeah.
Take away their skivvies, and they all look like P.F.C.s.
-Phew!
-I knew a brigadier once had a star tattooed on his chest in case he bumped into anybody in the shower.
Tell me, Doctor.
What was the general doing on the front lines, anyway?
This one, he's a fighting general.
You know-  - In that case, the least we can do is save him.
- Mm.
If you insist.
- Hey.
- What?
Okay.
Oh, boy, very shocky.
Push the plasma.
Give me 100 milligrams of hydrocortisone to give I.V. - It's empty, Doctor.
- Empty?
Get another one.
- It's the last one.
What are you talkin' about?
All right.
Keep pushing the plasma.
Get me some O-negative blood on the double.
Hurry up.
All right.
Okay.
He's out of danger for the time being.
Get Spearchucker to finish him.
But don't tell him a mere captain saved his life.
He might not pay his bill.
- Come on.
- Yeah.
Whoever screwed up on those orders- somebody's gonna get it.
- Yeah.
You wanna know where?
-  He should be hung up by his thumbs.
I'm old-fashioned.
I'm for slipping him a pint of castor oil and locking him in a closet.
- Who are you talking about?
- Whoever it is that ordered supplies last month.
It just so happens I signed that requisition, Mclntyre.
Well, you almost lost us a man, 'cause this was empty.
Well, well, that's not my fault.
You can't blame me.
I certainly had hydrocortisone on my list somewhere.
- Here-Here-Here it is.
- I heard that.
You have no right to blame Major Houlihan.
That hydrocortisone and half our other supplies were hijacked before they ever left Seoul.
- It's those vicious black marketeers.
- So where are the M.P.s?
Yeah.
They're supposed to do something besides direct traffic and rinse their gloves at night.
The army is well aware of its responsibilities.
It so happens a truck just pulled up outside with our replacement supplies.
Why didn't you say so?
Frank's gotta stop every five minutes and do a commercial for your friendly American war.
They're insufferable.
Last night I had a dream.
They both broke their jaws and had to have their mouths wired shut.
Sorry I'm late, but I got stopped by an M.P. roadblock.
They're checkin' everybody.
The area's crawling with hijackers.
Whoops.
- I'll bet you don't know what kind of wood this is.
- It's oak.
Nope.
It's oak.
Just look at it.
It's a hundred years old if it's a day.
Well, this is what a man needs, far from the security of home.
Roots.
Solidity.
Strength.
- Henry.
Henry, we're in big trouble.
- Don't do that.
I'm sorry about that.
Hey, how do you like my new desk?
Your new desk?
We just lost - What do you want from me?
- We want you to call General Hammond down in Seoul right away, demand some action.
I couldn't do that.
Henry, we have got to have that stuff.
Get me the Fourth Convalescent in Seoul.
I want to talk to General Hammond.
It's- If he's not there, try him at the officers' mess.
It's urgent.
I'm well aware of that.
I mean, I am a doctor too, you know.
Henry, that's your high school diploma.
Well, don't you recognize my voice yet, you knucklehead?
This is Colonel Blake.
Off the desk.
- Yeah, hello?
Hello?
Okay.
Uh, Colonel Blake?
- Hmm?
- General Hammond.
- Well, now, there's a coincidence for you, him calling me right now.
- Hello, General.
-  What do you want?
- Well, you called me, sir.
- I called you, huh?
Didn't I tell you to stay away from that homemade stuff?
- Black market.
- Off the desk.
Oh - No, sir.
I'm sorry.
What I wanted to talk to you about was the black market.
What did you want to say about it?
Well, it's terrible.
What I mean is, they just knocked off our supplies again.
Could you possibly send us another batch of hydrocortisone?
Now, listen, Henry.
I don't give a hoot in hell if you do have somebody that can bring us Bob Hope for Christmas.
- The 4077th got their allotment.
That's all you get.
- But General- I'm a busy man, Henry.
I've got an important meeting this afternoon with MacArthur.
Oh.
Yes, sir.
Good-bye, sir.
- I tried.
- That was trying, huh?
Well, we can't bother the general with this sort of thing.
He has a meeting this afternoon with MacArthur.
We gotta do something and be brilliant.
Listen.
If we can't figure out a way to out-black-market the black market, then we don't deserve the illustrious reputation we've tried so hard to achieve.
-  Any luck?
- Top pocket.
- Charlie Lee?
- He's your man.
He's the biggest operator in Seoul.
He has an office behind the bar that's owned by Madam Koo.
I, uh, signed out a jeep for you.
It's outside.
Make sure nobody steals it down there, huh?
Thanks, Radar.
I'll be back later to pump out your stomach.
Hey, listen.
We'd better hire somebody to watch the jeep.
I mean, with all this black market action.
You know, they're like piranhas.
You got a good thought there.
- But you didn't get it fast enough.
- They must've worked a pit stop.
I hope they choke on the tires.
-  Mr. Lee?
- To you, Charlie.
- I'm Hawkeye Pierce.
This is Trapper Mclntyre.
- And a terrific surgeon too.
- He's checked us out.
- Yeah.
You guys got the best rep in the Southeast Asia theater of operations.
Uh, listen.
I don't like to bring it up, but- - Come on, Charlie.
What is it?
- Lately I've been getting a grab right around here.
- Oh, a little tightness there?
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Lean over the desk.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Right up here?
Does it run down the arm?
- Yeah.
Right there.
Yeah.
- How's that?
- You know what that is?
Tension.
Pressure.
- Yes.
Yeah.
- How's everything at home?
Any trouble?
- Fine.
No problem.
- Business okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
- Charlie,you should take long weekends, try some golf.
- Yeah, have a little drink before dinner.
- It'll help?
- Well, it wouldn't hurt.
Hey, I love that sweater.
- Alpaca.
- For Charlie Lee, nothing but the best.
- Very nice.
- Now, what can I do for you fellas?
- I'll make it short and sweet.
There's been a heist, two shipments of medical supplies.
- There's a lot of call for that.
- We don't mind the other stuff, but they cleaned us out of hydrocortisone, and that we need, bad.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We made a deal this morning.
The stuff goes for $10,000.
- Ten thousand bucks?
- Tell you what.
I shouldn't do this.
You meet that offer, and I'll kill the other deal.
Charlie, where are we gonna come up with that kind of scratch?
Look.
We'll give it to you in trade.
Free hospitalization.
- Appendix operations.
Nose jobs.
- In my organization, we already have a health plan, including retirement benefits.
I got it.
We'll swap you something.
We can get our hands on all kinds of equipment.
- Oh, yeah.
A lot of stuff.
- There must be something you want.
- Wow.
- I bet he gives a year's guarantee on parts and labor.
This is only the showroom.
The real stuff is in the warehouse.
Lookit, fellas.
I'd like to go along with you, but I'm a businessman.
If there was just something you had I could use.
You know what, Charlie?
There is.
Something there's only one of in all of Southeast Asia.
A very special item that would enhance this office and give it what it cries out for: prestige.
A man of your importance shouldn't be sitting behind a piece of furniture like this.
The moment somebody walks in that door, they should know they're in the presence of nothing but the best.
You should have something at least 100 years old, something that represents dignity, roots, solidity.
A genuine American antique desk.
Wait till Henry gets a load of those stars.
You'll have to beat him off with a stick.
- Which way to the desk?
- In there.
Henry'll be the one with the furniture polish.
- Sir?
-  Hmm?
Sir, there's a general to see you.
-  -  Oh, God!
General Lee, our commanding officer, Colonel Blake.
So grand to meet you, Colonel Blake.
We didn't have any luck in Seoul, Henry, but the general was kind enough to drop us off.
- He's on an inspection tour.
- You tell truth.
Well, anything I can do to make you comfortable, sir.
I don't suppose you'd care for a little refreshment this early in the day?
Depend on what you have.
In my place, we have nothing but the best.
- General, nothing but the finest, sir.
- If it's good stuff, I'll know.
- Well, that's why we can't be too careful these days.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
You can't be too careful.
Well, here we go.
Little hair from the dragon, as it were.
General.
Cheers.
L 'chayim.
- You have nice office.
- Thank you.
Handsome desk.
Oh, you know quality.
- You know, if I were to tell you about this desk- - Tell him, Henry.
Tell him.
- Yeah.
Don't leave out a thing.
- Well, first of all, I'll bet you don't know what wood it is.
- Oak.
- Nope.
It's oak.
-  Handmade.
-  And it's handmade.
You know what that means?
- Not made in Japan on assembly line, huh?
- Right.
Tell me, Henry.
Just out of curiosity, how did you get a desk that big into this office?
- The top comes off.
- Ohh.
The top comes off.
You'll have to move this vehicle.
This space is reserved for ambulances.
- Wait a minute, Colonel.
- I'm a major.
- Want to be a colonel, huh?
- What do you mean by that?
Oh, forget it.
Forget it.
Want to buy a good watch?
Cheap.
Fourteen karat.
Swiss movement.
No, I don't wanna buy any watches.
Okay.
Wanna sell one?
Pay top dollar.
You get this vehicle out of here.
I don't want to see it or you when I come back.
You gave me the straight poop.
It's a deal.
The hydrocortisone for the desk.
- I'll have a truck in front of this building at 0600.
- Okay.
- But the desk better be here.
- Oh, yeah.
Because if it's not, the truck takes off, and I sell to my other buyer.
- It'll be here.
- I don't know how you guys are gonna pull this off.
-  - That makes two of us.
Three of us.
They're up to something.
That general's aide.
What kind of a man wears wristwatches on his leg?
I think we should tell the colonel.
They can wrap Henry around their little fingers.
We've got to go to him with conclusive evidence, something that'll get 'em court-martialed and behind bars for 20 years.
Oh, Frank, do you think you could?
- It's 0500.
- Okay.
Thanks.
Get lost.
Hey.
Come on.
We gotta get moving.
- I was just having- - I don't care who you were having.
Come on.
Come on.
-  -   These things were really built to last.
It's that lousy good craftsmanship.
Why didn't they make things like they do today?
- Margaret, is that you?
- Frank?
- I heard a noise- - I was just checking to see if- - Funny, isn't it?
- What?
Us.
You, me meeting like this.
- Oh, Frank.
- May I say you look very lovely, the way the flashlight catches your hair.
- I just washed it.
It must look a mess.
- It's beautiful.
Thank you.
- Margaret?
- Yes?
- Thank you.
- For what?
For being you.
Do you know what I love most about you?
Tell me.
Your lobes.
- They drive me wild.
- Oh, be wild, Frank.
Be wild.
- I'd like to slip into something a little more comfortable.
- Like what, darling?
- The supply tent.
- The supply tent.
Yes, yes, yes, honey.
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- That may have turned me off permanently.
Well, at least we know the colonel's liquor's safe.
We're locked in!
How does a guy who's so bad with a needle always know right where to jab us?
I don't know.
-  - Radar'd better have the key to this vault.
- Nope.
- Hurry up.
The truck'll be here soon.
All right.
-  - I think we just passed "soon.
" - What do I do now?
- Get your fanny out there and hold that truck.
What good is holding the truck when we can't even get the desk out of here?
Don't confuse me.
I can only handle one catastrophe at a time.
It's Radar!
I think we've stumbled on a whole syndicate.
My boss say, "If desk not ready, cut out fast.
" Okay, but my boss say, "Please wait.
" Come on, buddy.
Five minutes.
It isn't gonna cost you anything to give 'em a little- To give them a little what, Corporal?
I said, "To give them a little what"?
Uh, some more duck sauce for his egg roll, sir.
The colonel has to be kept happy.
- You're lying, Radar.
- Sir?
I happen to know the colonel despises duck sauce on his egg roll.
Major, you're absolutely right.
The truth is, sir, that this man is not a deliveryman.
Actually, sir, he's with the CIA, and he's on a case at this very moment.
I see.
Well, it so happens he looks fantastically like the man that tried to sell me a watch yesterday.
- I'd like to get a good look at your legs.
- Uh, one of those, huh?
You get this truck off the base in the next 60 seconds, or you'll be showing your watches to the M.P.s!
M.P.s?
Ah, yes, sir.
Maybe another time.
Got to solve big case.
- And you get back to headquarters!
- Yes, sir.
- What are you two doing?
- Early Mass.
Mass?
Well, where is Father Mulcahy?
We started without him.
Forget it.
The truck's gone.
- The major ordered him out.
- What are we gonna do?
We can't carry this thing to Seoul.
Get O'Brien.
All right, Frank.
You got me up, but you'd better have a good reason.
Well, the cold facts are, sir, that I believe there are black stockings- marketeers- operating on this base.
- I'm not in a position- - Black marketeers on my base?
My booze!
Where's O'Brien?
My desk.
My beautiful, What's going on here, Frank?
Pardon me, Henry.
Isn't that your desk?
Yeah.
That's my genuine antique desk.
Sending it out to be waxed?
I don't know what it's doin' up there.
It just keeps goin' up, up, up.
To a far, far better place, I'm sure.
Two hundred vials of hydrocortisone as promised.
We'll make sure it gets to the right people.
- You'll understand if we don't give you a receipt?
- Yeah.
Just got a wire from the insurance company.
They say they're willing to pay off on my desk as soon as I can give them a believable explanation.
Hey.
Have you got a relative who's a general?
You know how it is, Colonel: We all look alike.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Attention, all personnel.
All shifts report to operating room.
All shifts.
On the double.
Attention, all personnel.
All shifts report to operating room.
All shifts.
On the double.
Come on.
Take a card.
- Come on.
Make a play, will ya?
- Hold your colon, Doctor.
You were saving queens and throwing spades, right?
Gin.
That's 470,000 you owe me.
- Will you take a check?
- Oh!
I'm sorry.
Excuse me, Doctors.
I wasn't looking.
I'm doing enough looking for us both.
- You want to try that again?
Two out of three falls?
- I don't believe we've met.
What are you doing after the war?
Hey, wait a minute!
Okay, there it is.
Yeah.
Good.
- Is he out?
- The switch is off.
Anytime you're ready.
- Right.
Nurse?
- Yes, Doctor?
- That's "Yes, Doctor, darling.
" - Yes, Doctor, darling.
Stand by with the clamp.
UglyJohn, give me a reading on his pulse.
- Sixty-eight and steady.
- Okay.
Scalpel.
Hey, I like that.
Very good slap.
Good.
- All right.
Let me have the- - Scissors.
Terrific.
- Sponge.
- Sponge.
- Pickups.
- Pickups.
- Kiss.
- What?
Surprise me.
Make a note of that.
I want him put on report.
Disrespectful behavior.
She's a new one.
I'll take care of her.
We work very well together.
Why don't we get a few casualties of our own and go into business for ourselves?
Did you have to mobilize the duodenum?
Yeah.
I thought there might be a retro-peritoneal perforation.
There was a large hematoma in the area.
- Do you two want to be alone?
- Yeah, but not necessarily with each other.
No, really, I can move.
I'll say you can.
Pay no mind to my friend here.
He majored in crudeness at med school.
Med school?
Before I was drafted, I was a transmission mechanic.
If you're free later, I'll be glad to put you up on my lift.
- Nurse Cutler, report to my office.
- Now?
- Now.
- Yes, sir- I mean, yes, ma'am.
Dismissed.
At least she didn't have any trouble figuring out your sex.
- My sex is none of your business.
-Just say the word.
You stay away from my nurses.
They're off-limits to you.
- That's an order.
- I think she's trying to tell us something.
You can forget about Nurse Cutler.
I'll see to that.
That's your basic Hot Lips.
I knew a girl like her back in my hometown.
Her name was Rover.
Look, I don't know about you, but 12 straight hours of surgery has me whipped.
- I'm gonna sack out for a few weeks.
- My very thought.
I'm so tired, my eyes keep slamming shut.
I'm going to check on some X rays, then I'll see you back at "The Swamp"?
Gotcha.
For me?
Only if you put those on.
That was a pretty short nap.
I thought you were going to bed for a week.
I was, but I didn't say where, did I?
What about you?
This is strictly business.
I'm making a house call.
It must be obvious even to a moral defective like yourself that we're both zeroed in on the same girl, right?
Right, only I have a solution: We'll share her.
One girl, two straws?
You take the day watch, and I'll take the night.
-Unpacking?
Let us help.
-We're awfully glad you picked our unit.
- We're not as large as some of the others, but we are friendly.
- Very friendly.
- Actually, we never met a nurse we didn't like.
- Doctors, I am- Why don't we give this to the bellboy, and let us go to the river and watch the submarine races.
I have a better idea.
You go to the river and watch us wave good-bye to you.
I am not unpacking.
I'm packing.
All mixed-up.
Doesn't know whether she's coming or going.
Darling, packing is for leaving.
To stay you have to "un.
" I've been transferred to another unit.
- Transferred?
- Major Houlihan says I'm a bit of a distraction.
-What a rotten thing to say.
-Yeah.
You're an incredible distraction.
We're not giving you up.
You're the best thing to hit this place since dry socks.
But what can I do about it?
- Put yourself in our hands.
- Actually, these go on your legs.
Would 'twere that I were they.
- Thank you, Radar.
- Sign these, sir.
- What are these?
- Papers.
- Blank papers?
- Yes, sir.
- Is that a good idea?
- It's to cut down on your workload.
You sign them now, later you don't have to bother.
But should I have really signed blank papers?
I can't answer that.
You're the one that signed them, I didn't.
- I'm not gonna sign blank pieces of paper.
-  - 4077 MASH.
- I don't even know what I'm signing when they're not blank.
- Oh, hi.
Uh-huh.
- Fool Army, papers, double-talk, red tape, - Pretty good.
- sign this, sign that.
It's a little rough, but we're not complaining.
Who?
Yeah, he's here.
- It's for you.
- Blank paper- Who is it?
- General Barker.
- Who- General- Yes, sir.
Oh, fine, General.
A little rough, but we're not complaining.
Yes, sir.
A what?
A boxing tournament?
Well, sir, the main sport in this outfit is avoiding calisthenics.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
I'll do my best.
- Will that be all, General?
- Say good-bye for me.
- Hmm?
- Say good-bye for me?
Radar says to say, uh- Uh, g-good-bye, General.
I have enough to do.
Well, well.
Dr. Jekyll and Dr. Jekyll.
Henry, we gotta ask you something.
- Answer's no.
- Don't you wanna know what it is?
Whatever it is, even if the answer's yes, it's no.
Hot Lips has transferred Lieutenant Margie Cutler, - one of our most dedicated and best-built nurses.
- Hold it right there.
Major Houlihan is in complete charge of the nursing staff, and I can't interfere.
The young lady happens to be a sensational surgical assistant.
- She's got two of the best - I'm sure.
hands I've ever seen.
Don't let her go, Henry.
- Real talent in the operating room is hard to find.
- I know.
Henry, if you say no, we'll tell everybody that your brother's in jail.
- My brother is a warden.
- We won't say that part.
Now, lay off!
Haven't I got enough static with General Barker on my back?
- What's he want?
- Yeah.
Maybe we can help.
No, you can't help.
I mean, there's nothing that you could contribute to this problem.
- Ah, I detect a gleam.
- I heard a loud click.
One could almost see the lightbulb over his head.
Speak.
What is it?
Okay.
General Barker is all hot - about this inter-unit boxing tournament, - Yeah?
and he wants us to put up a boxer.
-  Now, that's funny.
- Maybe we could make one out of spare parts.
He's serious, and he's giving me a bad time about it.
Why don't you get whoever fought last year?
I can't.
She's gone.
- Anyway, Barker's got this boy, - Yeah?
- thinks he can win the championship.
- So?
- So he's bringing him here for his first fight.
- Mm-hmm.
Now, if, uh, one of you two guys would, say, go three rounds with him, I'll see what I can do about getting Nurse Cutler back for you.
-  - See ya around, Henry.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
We'll just find something nice and easy to do, like shagging shells.
Just a thought.
Some war.
Bye, Doctors.
Thanks a lot, Hot Lips.
- Hey, do that again.
- What?
- Smack your fist.
- You mean that?
- It hurts my ears.
What a crunch.
- Save it.
- Save what?
- Don't hustle me 'cause I'm not fighting anybody.
- That's a shame.
I bet you're a natural.
- I fought in school.
- As a matter of fact, I was very good.
- I knew it.
- But I'm not in shape.
- Who says you're not in shape?
You got a cute body.
I've seen guys sneaking peeks at you at calisthenics.
Which guys are sneaking peeks at me?
I'd rather not say.
Some of them are married.
Look, stop snowing me.
You fight him.
I'd love to.
I was on the boxing team in college too.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, but I threw my- I threw my shoulder out.
It never came back.
Actually, I'm in pain most of the time.
I don't like to burden my friends.
Look.
- Do we want to get Nurse Cutler back or not?
- Yes.
All right.
Okay.
You really got a bad shoulder?
The result of being spineless.
Ahh!
-Wait a minute.
I don't know about this.
-What do you mean?
He's got a manager and everything.
Come on, Radar.
It's just a little sparring.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
- No, I'm not gonna do it.
Not for a lousy five bucks.
- How about ten?
Pay up now?
All right.
This is just a practice fight.
I want you to get loose.
Just keep dancing around.
Keep your left up.
Jab!
Jab,jab, Trap!
Jab!
He's just loosening up.
He's gotta get in shape.
-  - It takes a while, you know, to get back in shape, get all your old stuff back.
He's gotta get his wind back and everything.
I'll write his wife.
Don't listen to him.
Just keep moving.
Keep hanging in there.
Keep your left up.
Up.
Up with the left.
Move, Trapper.
Oh, hi, Father.
I trained a number of boys to box back home.
You got any advice for Trapper?
Prayer- I don't think he's got one.
Thanks a lot, Father.
Once again, double or nothing?
A glass stomach?
Let's go!
Pick those legs up!
Breathe deeply!
Run!
Move it!
I'm tired, Hawkeye!
How far have I run?
Thirty feet.
That'll do it.
I figure to punch him, not run him to death.
Now put more shoulder into it.
Use your whole body.
Try it again.
Try it again.
Oh, good morning, Major.
Good morning, Captain.
I'm afraid I can't ask you to stay.
My boy's in training, and he's not even supposed to look at a women until after the fight.
Oh.
Oh, I understand.
Just a minute.
Isn't that Frank's bag?
I thought you were Frank's bag.
Oh!
How's it goin'?
We decided to have a victory drink now in case there's no need to later.
- Care to join us?
- Oh, yeah.
Anything wrong?
General Barker just pulled in with his fighter.
- Looks real big.
- How big?
If he wanted to, he could be a platoon.
- Looks kind of mean too.
- Mean?
What's does "mean" mean?
"Mean" means nothing.
It's skill that counts.
Big and mean have nothing to do with fighting ability.
A guy told me that he was crossing the road, and this jeep came too close to him.
- He punched it.
- He punched a jeep?
He knocked it out.
Hawkeye, this guy knocks out jeeps!
Showboat.
You're not getting in the ring with that guy until I hear him speak.
This fight has just been called on account of chicken.
We are not gonna throw in the towel.
I'm ready to throw in the whole laundry truck.
This ape will never lay a glove on you.
Trust me.
You won't even have to touch him.
I'll go down during the instructions.
A little obvious.
I got a better idea.
Come on.
I don't think I want to risk my life on a dumb trick like this.
I know what I'm doing.
I pulled this same stunt in university.
- Use more.
Use a lot.
- I still say we should use a horseshoe.
A horseshoe is gauche.
Ether is subtle.
Then let's dip the horseshoe in ether.
Right.
Now, the thing you gotta do is you gotta jab.
Right?
Keep jabbing, jab,jab,jabbing.
Right?
- Six, seven whiffs, he'll be out cold.
- Great.
The thing to remember is not to get it near your own hooter.
- Don't get it near your own nose, or you're dead.
- Get him in a clinch.
- That's it.
- Get him in that clinch, and just hold it- - Hold it right in his nose.
Get him so he can't move.
- How is the guy gonna- He's gonna inhale it.
He'll never know what hit him.
Just keep it right there.
Keep him in a clinch so he can't move, and all he can do is- Way to go, champ.
Third round, Sugar Ray breaks the man's face.
He broke his nose, broke his jaw, sinuses.
The guy's a mess.
Gentlemen, may I join you?
- Please, Frank, not while we're eating.
- What kidders.
- Well, what happened?
- The guy never went down.
- Ten-hut!
- As you were.
Mclntyre, I don't believe you've met Sergeant Flacker.
Easy.
Me doctor.
Need hands.
Operate.
Hey, Henry, can we rustle up some steaks for the sergeant, huh?
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Good.
Come on.
Come on, boy.
You better hurry up, Henry.
He looked at your arm like it was an hors d'oeuvre.
Dittsbury, you wanna go out and get Flacker a cow?
Listen, are you sure that Nurse Cutler's worth it?
- I really don't want you to get hurt.
- Hurt?
What would you say if I told you that Trapper is gonna win that fight?
All right.
Okay.
Down, Henry.
Down.
I'm sorry, but you mean Trapper beat that gorilla?
That's ether.
A little louder.
The cook didn't hear you.
- It's not very ethical.
- It's not even moral, but we're in a war zone.
Yeah, well, I don't want to know about it.
I mean, I love it- But I don't want to know about it.
- Where is it?
You sure you got it?
- It's in the bucket.
- I'll put it on right after the introductions.
- Make sure you use enough.
I don't want this guy waking up until after I've been a civilian for a few years.
- Did you get it?
- Nothing but pure distilled water.
Say, you wouldn't be averse to laying a small bet on the outcome, would you?
- No, sir.
- What do you say to a hundred?
- Dollars?
- Yes.
- You got it.
- Good.
Good evening and welcome to the Inter-Camp Boxing Tournament.
Introducing the contestants.
In this corner, representing the 3099th Mobile Army Hospital, weighing 260 pounds, with a record of 97 wins, no losses and three arrests: Sergeant "Killer" Flacker!
Boo!
- Boo!
- Hooray!
And in this corner, representing the fighting 4077 th, weighing 175 pounds, all of it heart: Kid Doctor!
All right, fellas.
I want a good, clean fight.
Who doesn't?
No low blows, no holding, no rabbit punches, no kidney punches.
Sounds like a dull evening.
Go back to your corners, and when you hear the bell, come out fighting.
And may the best man win.
You be careful you don't breathe in any of this stuff yourself.
Keep the glove away.
Stick it in his face!
Put it in his face!
Put the glove in his face!
Put it in his face!
That's a pretty unorthodox style your boy has there.
- He's still on his feet.
- Maybe you'd like to double that bet.
- If you insist, General.
- Good.
Put it right in his face!
Put it- Get him in a clinch!
Put it up in there!
What's he doing?
Get it in his face!
Get it up in his face!
Get it up in his face!
Stick it in his face!
What's the matter with you?
Keep it comin' in.
Get up!
Get up!
- Get up, Trapper!
Trap, get up!
- One, two, - three, four- - Hello, Hawkeye.
- What are you doing at the prom?
- We've been had.
Somebody switched bottles on us.
- six, seven, - You stall him.
I'll be right back.
- No, you stall him.
I'll be right back.
- eight.
- - Oh, no!
-Get up!
Get up!
-Get up, Trap!
Trap, get up!
Come on!
- three, four, - Get up!
Pull yourself up!
- five.
- Get up!
You're okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
- Where am I?
- You're right here in the ring.
Now for the big question: Who am I?
Everything is gonna be all right.
Don't waste any time.
Get him in a clinch and stick this right in his face.
- Whose face?
-  Come on!
Go!
Get him in a clinch!
That's it!
Hug him!
Get him in a- That's it!
Stick it in his face!
Get him- - That's it!
That's it!
-  - -  One, two, three, four-  - six, seven, - eight, nine ten.
You did it.
- How does it feel?
- Hard to see through.
Well, I couldn't get a prescription steak.
You want a martini?
- My very thought.
- Oh, here's something for both eyes.
Gentlemen, well, you lived up to your part of the deal, and I have lived up to mine.
Keep moving, or you're dead.
- It's true.
You fought for me.
- That's right.
I must say I'm impressed.
- I should hope so.
- I managed him.
Does it hurt?
Not a lot, no.
I laid out his training.
You think it's easy planning strategy and standing in the corner wondering if he'll ever come home?
I would have fought myself, but I had this shoulder injury in college and- it never got better.
I, uh- I try not to burden my friends with it, uh, actually.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hey, is it possible to sue your feet for divorce?
With your luck, you'd get custody of the arches.
Mine are killing me.
Sure wish they'd let us operate sitting down.
They might, if we could talk the patients into standing up.
Fix you a martini?
Haven't you two anything better to do when you're off duty than to lie around and swill gin?
"Swill gin"?
Sir, I have sipped, lapped and taken gin intravenously, but I have never swilled.
Actually, I'm pursuing my lifelong quest for the perfect, the absolutely driest martini to be found in this or any other world.
And I think I may have hit upon the perfect formula.
- Five to one?
- Not quite.
You pour six jiggers of gin, and you drink it while staring at a picture of Lorenzo Schwartz, the inventor of vermouth.
- Twaddle.
- Watch your language, Frank, or I'll wash your mouth out with soap.
By the way, did you know soap was a four-letter word?
Hey, Frank, are we disturbing you?
'Cause if we are, I can arrange to get shipped back to the States.
You're not disturbing me.
I'm putting my time to good, constructive use.
- Oh.
-  What are you doing?
That question itself shows how bored I am.
Writing my patients back home.
I keep in touch with each and every one of them.
- That's a pretty big job, isn't it?
- Not really.
I send them a form letter.
"What's Up Front, Doc"?
- A small joke.
- Almost stillborn.
"Well, the fighting here goes on, but I must go along with MacArthur and agree that the beginning of the end is in sight.
" - That's pretty stylish.
- I wrote on the school paper.
I wrote on the walls.
I don't know whether to go on reading this or wait for the movie to come out.
What do you mean?
You're quite a guy in here.
Your exploits make Superman seem like a fairy.
Everything in there is true.
But it's such a commercial for yourself.
I was building a pretty good practice when I got called up.
I'll be darned if I'll let those people forget me while I'm over here.
Maybe you could bring the plague back home just to get things started again.
Or you could introduce jungle rot to Indiana.
You're both jealous.
I was in practice only three years, and I already had a $35,000 house and two cars.
Choppers!
- How many?
- Too many.
- We just got through with two days of casualties.
- Speak to the enemy, sir.
-  -  Choppers!
- Pull that back.
- Yes, sir.
Let's go, baby, or this boy's kidney's never gonna dance again.
- Can I help?
- Help her retract.
This guy's got a bellyful of shrapnel.
Give me a hand.
- I'll be right there.
- I can give you a hand in a minute.
Never mind.
I'll wait.
Why do you keep handing me the wrong instruments?
Because you keep asking for the wrong instruments.
Will you shut up?
How would you like a spleen across the mouth?
Gentlemen!
You're doctors, remember?
I've seen better surgeons operating on trees.
- How many waiting out there?
- Couple of dozen.
I've got a pancreatic injury here.
Anything outside the skull, I'm dead.
- Drain it!
- Resect it!
- Thanks, Hawkeye.
The book says drain it.
Always!
If you were a proctologist, I'd tell you what to do with that book.
You're a year behind in your journals.
Clean that up while I'm gone.
Let's go!
We got people double-parked.
I can't find anything.
You left it in your tent, sir.
- My fishing catalog?
- Your fishing catalog.
Yes, sir.
- Where do I sign?
- Sir, I'd read that very carefully.
It's from Major Burns.
He's right outside.
- Tell him I'm not in.
- Yes, sir.
Sir?
Frank Burns has to be the biggest horse's patoot on this post.
You think so?
Frank.
Dismissed.
You heard him, sir.
He's talking to you.
You seriously want to press these charges, Frank?
You bet I do.
"Insubordination.
Failure to salute a superior officer.
" I'm a major.
Pierce is a captain.
He's never saluted me once.
The nearest thing to a salute on this post is the camp mutt, scratching the fleas behind his ears.
"Lack of military courtesy.
Captain Pierce constantly calls me by my first name.
" Not allowed, Henry.
Page 85, the Army Offiicer's Guide.
You honestly want him to call you Major?
I have got oak leaves on my shoulders.
And I've got dimples on my butt.
None of that means anything around here, Frank.
Shall we get on with the charges?
You insist on pressing them?
- Radar!
- Yes, sir?
- Get Pierce and tell him I want to see him.
- I sent for Captain Pierce.
- Right this way, sir.
- Show him in.
- Whatever it is, it better be good.
- He's out of uniform, as usual.
I tried sleeping in my uniform, Frank, but my medals keep stabbing me.
Burns says the operating room is becoming impossible.
He's right.
I agree.
All that blood and those sick people.
It's terrible.
You know what I'm talking about.
You're trying to take over.
You answer every question, call every shot.
- You do it.
I don't care.
- They don't ask me the questions!
I can't understand that.
You've got a $35,000 car and two houses.
- That's a $35,000 house and two cars.
- Uh-huh.
You were still working in a hospital when they called you up.
I realize it's ridiculous for a doctor to work in a hospital.
It screws up your golf.
- Burns does outrank you, Pierce.
- It took the U.N. to do it.
- Listen, Pierce- - Knock it off!
This can't continue.
- Why don't you sell me to the Red Sox?
- I'd love to.
- But what I obviously have to do is appoint a chief surgeon.
- Now you're talking.
He'll be in charge of all surgical situations.
In addition to his own work, he'll assist each shift to help with the tough cases.
- The job will be a killer.
- I can adjust.
I hope you can.
I'm giving it to Pierce.
Oh, thanks.
What?
You can't!
I won't stand for it.
The one thing that will get you nowhere with me is impersonating my wife.
What about rank?
- Can I help it if I'm not as rank as you?
- This is unheard of!
Face it.
Pierce is the best cutter in the outfit.
He's certified in chest and general surgery.
In case you haven't read the papers, there's a war on.
We're here to patch guys together.
We can't be so G.I. we lose patients.
-Are you implying he's a better doctor?
-Yes, when the heat's on.
If you want heat, I'll give you plenty of heat!
Frank?
"Failure to salute a superior officer.
" Hey, you may just turn out to be one of the good guys yet, Henry.
Hawkeye, don't let me down.
Would I do anything to disgrace this uniform?
- Margaret, I, uh- - Frank!
I- Oh, I was just, uh, fixing this cut I have on my head.
Margaret, something just awful has happened.
- Take a deep breath, Frank.
-  - Now tell me.
- Margaret, something just awful has happened.
- And?
- Colonel Blake's appointed Pierce chief surgeon over me.
He can't!
It's against regulations.
- Doesn't he know that?
- He did.
It is, and he does.
Oh, my poor baby.
Frank, it's not unmanly to cry.
I would not give them the satisfaction.
That's my strong fella.
Oh, Margaret.
-  - Attention.
Attention, all personnel.
Barring the arrival of new casualties, at 2100 hours tonight, there will be a special ceremony in the mess hall to crown the 4077th's new chief surgeon.
That means tonight's movie is moved to tomorrow.
It's the latest War Department film on the dangers of V.D. Be sure to see it with someone you love.
Put on the record.
Quiet, please, everybody.
This is the moment you've all been waiting for.
Ladies and gentlemen and anything in between, it gives me great pleasure to present Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce, our new chief surgeon.
- ##  -   Thank you.
Thank you.
You may all kiss my ring.
- They're gonna get theirs.
Boy.
- Type, Frank.
Type.
- Speech!
Speech!
Speech!
- Speech, yes.
Some men are born to greatness.
Others have it thrust upon them.
And then there are those of us who got it both ways.
Keep those crowds back behind the toilet paper.
"Dear General Barker, I think I should call to your attention-"  "My qualifications as a doctor-" -  $35,000?
- Hmm?
Mmm.
Type.
Type.
Margaret, when you touch me like that, I- Type.
Type.
I guess you could say that medicine has been my life.
I always wanted to be a doctor- Just ask any little girl I grew up with.
Frank.
Call me Tiger.
Frank.
- Your oak leaves are killing me.
- Oh!
Oh.
Now how will I be able to write the general?
Come on.
But let me say this, honestly, when you live in a cruddy situation like this long enough, you get to love a few people and even hate a few.
I guess outside of our families we'll never be closer to anybody than we are to each other.
You finished?
What did I get on the humble meter?
- One more thing, then we got to get back on duty.
- I'll buy that.
I assure you that it's imperative, sir, or I wouldn't have called.
The trappings of your offiice, sire.
Your orb.
But, sir, I- but, sir- General Barker?
Margaret Houlihan.
Yes.
I think you ought to get up here at once, sir, for the good of your command.
- Your scepter.
-  Yes, sir.
I think you ought to take a good look at your new chief surgeon.
Major Houlihan, Burns.
- We're so glad you're here, sir.
- So glad.
The situation better be as bad as you indicated, Burns.
I'm happy to say it's worse, sir.
There's a badly wounded patient who's been waiting to be operated on since 1:30.
He's just lying there waiting.
- It's 2:00 now.
- 2:03.
All right, I'll get right into this.
I may want to see you later, Major, for your own personal slant on all this.
Yes, sir.
Just where, may I ask, is Chief Surgeon Pierce with a patient waiting in surgery?
Well, sir, you wouldn't believe this.
I don't like this at all.
No, sir.
- You took three?
- Right.
- And you, Kaplan?
- Two.
- And you didn't take any?
- Nope.
How would you like a land mine up your moustache?
Ten bucks, Hawkeye.
I'd like to win this pot while I'm young enough to enjoy it.
Easy, fungus face.
Call.
- Out.
- 'Night, all.
- Full house.
- Three of a kind, all bad.
- I've seen bigger pots.
- Keep away from the mirror.
- What are we playing?
- Threes and nines are wild.
If you want, you can buy a new card on an open four.
Except February which has 28.
- We here to play or talk?
- I think I'm here to lose.
Ace bets a dollar, blind.
- That's a lot of respect for one ace.
- As you were.
Oh, hiya, General.
What are you doing, marching in your sleep?
- Ace bet a buck.
Who's in?
- I call.
Pierce, I've been told you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible.
- You bet your bellybutton, Dad.
- I what?
- Pair of twos says five.
- Out.
- In.
- Pierce.
You're a little late, General.
I'll deal you in next hand.
That soldier requires surgery.
Right, that's why I checked him into the hospital instead of the P.X. Are you gonna take care of him, or are you gonna go on playing poker?
General, the man came in with a chest wound.
I put a tube in him, and I'm watching him very carefully.
You call this watching?
I get a bulletin every quarter hour from the nurse who is very devoted and a great kisser.
When do you intend to operate?
Hopefully, never, but if I have to, I figure around 3:00 a. m. By that time, he will have been given his blood, and his pulse and his pressure should be stabilized.
Until then, you're going to do nothing?
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course I'm going to do something.
I'm going to meet his five dollars and raise two more.
You're not talking to some idiot desk jockey, Captain.
I'm a doctor myself.
If you want to operate now, be my guest.
I get the same pay whether I work or not.
Your two and two more.
Pierce, you're in very deep trouble.
I don't think so.
I can beat a pair of twos.
Fold that.
This conduct is intolerable as a chief surgeon.
I order you to begin that operation.
Either take the case yourself or join me at 3:00.
You're making it impossible for me to concentrate on my poker.
If I don't win this pot, I'll never be able to send my sister a new truss.
The last raise is mine.
You haven't heard the last of this.
I wasn't listening to the first of it.
We'll just wait until we hear what Colonel Blake has to say about it all.
- Watch out for the- -  -  - trash can.
I hate loud generals.
- Are you in or not?
- Yeah.
Oh.
- Soldier!
- Yes, sir.
- Which way to Colonel Blake's?
- Twenty feet straight ahead.
- Were you born in that position?
- Yes, sir- No, sir!
- Dismissed.
- Yes, sir.
- What are you doing, Corporal?
- Doing, sir?
D-o-i-n-g.
What are you doing?
Listening to you spell doing, sir.
Doesn't Colonel Blake mind your smoking his cigars and drinking his brandy?
- Yes, sir, very much.
- Then why are you doing it?
I don't mind, and I figured as long as one of us is reasonable.
Just a little joke- Ten-hut!
Is your hand broken?
Get that cigar out of your hand.
Now, tell me, where is Colonel Blake?
If he isn't in his tent, he could be anywhere.
Doesn't anybody in this outfit ever go to sleep?
Only on duty, sir.
Halt!
Friend or foe?
I'm General Barker!
How do I know you're not one of them with a clever makeup job?
- Corporal Klinger, isn't it?
- Right!
Still trying to get out on a psycho, eh, Klinger?
I can tell you, it'll take a lot more than this.
Then I'll just have to keep trying, Mary.
- General Barker?
- What, may I ask, is going on here?
-Just playing, sir.
- That I can see, but what?
Strip dominoes.
Nurse, is everybody around here crazy?
Everybody who's sane is, sir.
Just tell me, please, which is Colonel Blake's tent?
Right outside, sir, hang a right, two tents.
Thank you.
Go to bed.
- See?
- Forget it.
Coast is clear.
Be with you as soon as I can.
Bet this looks funny.
Bet it doesn't.
Any luck, dear- Oh!
General.
I'm sorry, sir.
I thought- Honey, I got us some real beauties.
- Henry!
- General Barker, what are you doing- Where have you been?
Digging worms for fishing.
And leaving this place run by that maniac you appointed chief surgeon?
I can assure you Captain Pierce is very capable, sir.
- You think so, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- Come with me.
- Yes, sir.
- Leave the worms.
- Yes, sir.
He said leave the worms.
This place is a madhouse, Henry, a nut farm.
Gee whiz, that's a bit strong, sir.
Do you realize you've a man on guard duty who's wearing a skirt?
Luckily he's got the legs for it.
- Where's Pierce?
- Over in surgery.
- Come on!
- As you were.
- How much did you win?
- About 50 bucks.
I'm sending it to my wife for her private detective fund.
Is she going to have you followed out here?
It's for when I get back home, starting the second night.
- Ah, Pierce.
- Ah, pull up a sink, General.
- Still got a patient?
- At 1:30 when I checked him last, our guy in there had been given less than a pint of blood, whereas he'd lost two or three.
His pulse was around 120.
His pressure was down to around 90.
Now at 3:00, he's been given three pints of blood.
His pulse is 80.
His pressure is 120, and he's received five million units of penicillin intravenously.
Of course, his chest is still bleeding, but now we can operate safely and quickly.
We don't have to do it frantically and carelessly.
Let's get nice and sterile.
What's that worm doin' in there?
Okay, General, now I'm going to sandbag you.
You think we're ready to get out of this chest yet?
- Obviously you don't.
- Give the man a cigar.
The general or the patient?
See, Dad, we haven't found any small holes in the lung yet, only large ones.
I think he's got one in his lingula that we won't find unless we look for it.
I've seen some bubbles I can't account for.
Give me some suction here.
- And there it is.
- I'm impressed.
So am I. Let's over-sew the lung.
Well, sir, what do you think of my chief surgeon now?
I'm not very good at apologies, Pierce, but forgive a rusty old doctor, will you?
I think you're very good at apologies, General.
Major Burns is probably going to continue to complain to you about the promotion.
- May I make a suggestion about Major Burns?
- Yes, sir.
Give him a high colonic and send him on a ten-mile hike.
- With full pack.
- Good touch.
Well, I'll see you to your jeep, sir.
I don't expect to be back unless you got problems, Henry- real problems.
Problems at the 4077, sir?
-  Halt!
- Klinger!
- Who goes there?
- The man's naked!
Come on, Klinger.
Put on a dress or something.
At least a slip.
- Longfingers.
- Longfingers.
Stick a drain in there.
- Hawk, this looks like a job for Clark Kent.
- Coming.
Put a stitch in that drain.
I'll be right back.
Watch it.
- Pierce?
- What?
Can you give me a hand with this resection?
- Can you hold on for a second?
- Sure, no sweat.
I'm ready, Doctor.
We'll split the fee, right?
Right.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Oh!
Look.
It's daylight again.
Fourteen hours.
Rough session.
Very rough.
Somebody is using the U.S. Army for target practice.
Let's get some breakfast and hit the sack.
I'm with you, big fella.
And this morning it's two olives in my breakfast.
Would you tell me where I might find Colonel Blake's office?
Yes, Sergeant.
You go straight down there, turn left and you look for a broken-down, dirty, old man and follow him.
- Yes, sir.
He'll take me to Colonel Blake?
- That is Colonel Blake.
- Thank you, sir.
Young Hi.
- Roger wilco, Sergeant Baker-san.
Find the noncom tent, organize a shower, unpack my clean fatigues and shine my other boots.
Draw rations from the mess tent and unpack the other gear.
And be sure and keep them cigarettes under lock and key.
Understood?
Roger wilco, Sergeant Baker-san.
- What's she going to do with the rest of the day?
- Practice her shorthand.
- The gooks, they don't mind working.
- Uh, Sergeant I don't care for that word.
- "Gooks"?
- Yeah.
- Nothing personal, sir.
- Then knock it off!
.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Okay, Young Hi, let's move.
What do you mean, "his moose"?
That's just the name for it, Hawkeye- "moose.
" It's from "musume, " Japanese for "girl.
" Yeah?
What's Japanese for "living together"?
That might not be the case here.
She could be just his servant.
Yeah?
With or without fringe benefits?
I talked to her.
The sergeant bought her from her family for $500.
" Bought her"?
Is that what you said, or do we have a bad connection?
Some of the locals sell their kids for the money.
They have no other means.
- That's right.
- Do you believe that?
- That slob bought a human being.
- Why doesn't the Army do something?
They will bust a guy if they find out, but they don't go looking for it.
The dislike I felt for that sergeant has blossomed into instant hatred.
I read someplace the U.N. was here to liberate these people.
Must've been a misprint.
-I'm going to do something about this.
I'm talking to Henry.
-Henry?
- Yeah.
- Our Henry?
I thought you said you were going to do something about it.
Of course it's illegal and immoral!
I can order Baker to release her, and he can pick her up five minutes after he leaves.
Then get in touch with his own colonel.
Ask him to order her release.
-Just one little thing wrong with that.
- What?
Baker's colonel has a moose of his own.
- That's rotten.
It stinks.
- Okay, okay.
Excuse me.
Things dry quicker in my tent.
-I never thought you'd chicken out like this.
- Come on!
If you don't have any more guts than that, then I'll quit this outfit.
I'll quit the war.
Really?
Well, who's gonna break the news to Truman and MacArthur?
Hey, Young Hi, can we talk to you for a minute?
- You got washing?
- No, no, no, no.
Uh, y-you understand that it's wrong for human beings to own each other?
Roger wilco, Captain-san.
Yeah, but do you really understand?
Yes.
I make English perfect.
Speak very goodly.
Hello,Joe.
What you know?
You got candy bar for Mother?
She sick.
That's goodly enough for me.
Why do you stay with this Baker?
- Are you in love with that slob?
- What mean "slob"?
- Well, it's a way of referring to another person.
- Roger wilco.
Don't love Baker slob-san.
Don't make monkey business with him.
We can help you get away from Baker.
You can go back to Seoul or anywhere you want.
To run away, I dishonor my family.
Sergeant pay money for me.
I can leave only when he say.
Is it possible this kid likes her work?
No, she just doesn't understand.
She's too young.
I must work now.
Must wash more socks, press shirts and shine boots.
Where were you when I wanted to get married?
Go ahead, but tell Baker slob-san that Captain Pierce wants to see him on the double.
- You get it?
- I get it, Captain-san.
Roger wilco.
Sergeant, we've never had anybody in this outfit who owned a moose.
We don't believe in it.
It's very un-American.
It's un-Korean.
It's un-everybody.
Therefore, I order you to release this person you've bought.
- Sir, all I did- - That is a direct order.
- You heard the captain.
- I want her off this post and on the way back to her family by tomorrow morning- dismissed.
- Dismissed.
- What are you guys doin'- buckin' to be chaplains?
- Stand at attention, soldier.
- I've been in the army a long time, and no meat cutter with a temporary commission is gonna work me over.
So save that G.I. crapola for the folks back home.
"Crapola"?
Will you- Make a note of that for his court-martial.
Uh, you got a pencil?
I'm a transient.
Your authority over me is limited and you know it.
So you can just stop trying to push me around.
Now, is there anything else, sir?
You know, you're a pretty decent guy at that, Baker, right?
- Uh, right.
- And smart too.
Here, sit down.
Baker, would you be interested in selling Young Hi?
Uh, yeah.
We've always wanted a moose of our own.
- Yeah, a good transportation moose.
- A one-owner-type moose.
You just got finished giving me a lecture on how it's wrong to- I know, but you got to swing with the times.
You paid 500 for her, right?
- Right.
- We'll give you six.
- For Young Hi?
You're out of your mind.
- Here, have a martini.
Aw, thanks.
I taught that kid laundry, cooking, sewing.
Well, I realize she's not just another pretty face.
I can get double that for her in Seoul, but I ain't interested.
- Time's a-wastin'.
- Stick around.
We'll buy you another couple of drinks.
Naw.
I'll take a rain check.
See ya, gentlemen.
Can you believe that creep?
Aw, he's your basic moose owner.
Think it would look too suspicious if he got run over by a jeep in the shower?
I could always say I took a wrong turn.
-I don't believe we can beat this joker.
-Then what the hell are we doing here?
Why do we spend 18 hours a day in that lousy operating room putting people back together?
Doesn't that have any meaning?
What's the purpose of that- practice?
We gotta get that kid away from him.
How?
What do we do best?
Think.
How do we get her by drinking gin?
I mean, our real, if only, talent.
Operate on him.
Right.
Ten bucks.
Ah, too rich for me.
Your ten- I bump 50.
- That puts me away.
- Yeah, me too.
What do ya say, Doc?
Just a minute, handsome stranger.
He's got a pair of kings an ace and garbage.
You got that?
Anytime, Doc.
Uh, your 50, and 50 more.
I call to raise.
I'll take two.
Two good ones off the top.
He kept the kings and the ace kicker.
He bought a deuce and another ace.
He's got aces and kings.
I bet a hundred.
And another hundred, sweetheart.
You're bluffin'.
I call.
Aces up.
No good.
Three deuces.
You bet 150 bucks on three lousy deuces?
I'm putting my sister through barber college.
Any questions?
He's working on an open-end straight flush.
All diamonds.
He's got the two, three, four and five and a jack of spades.
I need a top card.
Dealer takes one.
Shuffling.
Shuffling.
The card he bought is- Wait a minute.
Something's blocking me.
What do you say, Doc?
What's your bet?
What's your rush?
You got another war to go to?
I'm still blocked.
Oh, boy, am I blocked.
- Bet or check, Doc?
- I'm thinking.
Okay, trouble's in the shower- I mean, trouble's fixed.
I'm- I'm unblocked.
The card he bought is a six of clubs.
No flush, but a baby straight.
Okay, uh, pardner, how much money you got there in front of you?
About 750 bucks.
Then that's the bet.
- If I call, it cleans me.
- It's only money.
Baby straight.
Nope.
A teensy-weensy flush.
You got over a thousand bucks of my dough.
And let's not forget this little old I.O.U. for 1,200.
I'm good for it.
I'll pay it.
- The understanding before we started was a cash game.
- You took my I.O.U. Only because you're a fine human being.
Now pay up, fine human being.
I ain't got the money right now.
You wanna get even, Baker?
Get your I.O.U. back and a thousand of the money you lost?
Who do I have to kill?
Take that and put down your pink slip on Young Hi.
- She's all yours, Doc.
I explained the whole deal.
- You understand, Young Hi?
Roger wilco, Hawkeye slob-san.
- Boy, once she learns something- - Well, this is it, Young Hi.
- You're a good kid, and if you ever need a reference, I'll- - Okay.
Fine, Baker.
- Yeah.
Well, you take it easy, kid.
- Shove off.
Yes, sir.
Good-bye, kid.
Now, listen.
You understand?
You don't belong to Baker anymore.
Roger wilco.
I belong to you.
No, no, no.
Now you can go back to your family.
I paid the money.
There's no dishonor.
Go?
I be good moose for Hawkeye slob-san.
Make shave for you, shine shoes, laundry, cooking on stove.
- You see.
You be very satisfied.
- No, wait a minute- I get my gear, start work.
You see.
Everything be okay.
You be happy like hell.
- Young- Young Hi!
- I come back.
Don't worry, Hawkeye-san.
I never leave you.
" Dear Dad- We had a little poker game today.
It seems I won a person.
" " Dear Dad- I know you always wished I had a sister.
" " Dear Dad-" Hey, there's Captain Pierce well-known surgeon and moose owner.
Really?
He's the man who coined the phrase, " No moose is good moose.
" Drop dead, singly and/or collectively.
Told you he's one of the great phrasemakers.
Holy cow!
We must be in the wrong tent.
Hawkeye, come in here!
Yeah, get your butt in here.
- Yes?
- Somebody sneaked in here and committed a neatness.
- Young Hi.
- Can you believe it?
The clothes are hung up.
- The garbage is off the floor.
The place is clean!
- It's sickening.
All right.
Calm down.
I'm as offended as you are by this repulsive tidiness.
It's all arranged.
There's a truck leaving this afternoon for Seoul, and I guarantee she'll be on it.
- Now are you satisfied?
- Okay.
But as soon as she's gone, we dirty up the joint and get back to normal.
They don't call you "The Aristocrat of the A.M.A." for nothing.
Please, no stay here with you?
I told you, you got a right to a life of your own.
You're gonna have it.
- But I make you happy.
- No.
So long, Young Hi.
- Okay, driver, take off.
- Please, I stay!
I be good worker!
- Young Hi, wait a- Wait a second.
- Please, I want to stay!
- Good luck.
- No, I don't want to go!
Oh, Hawkeye.
Oh.
Oh, your kisses are driving me crazy.
And I'm only using one lip.
Oh!
- One question.
- What?
Why are we sitting in the middle of a mine field?
It was the only reservation I could get.
Every jeep in town was sold out.
-  - Oh!
Oh!
You're biting my throat.
Sorry.
I got carried away and started a tracheotomy.
-  Ow.
- Oh, what is it?
- I bit your dog tag.
-  Oh, Hawkeye, why do I go out with you?
'Cause I got class.
I'm a high roller.
Someday, baby, all this will be yours- the mine field, the cesspool, all of it.
Shut up.
Hey, Hawk!
- Who is it?
- Trapper, our friendly neighborhood Peeping Tom.
- Turn off those lights.
- We got trouble.
What, wounded?
I didn't hear any choppers.
What is it?
The moose is back in town.
Ho-Jon says she left the truck when they stopped for gas.
- She hitched a ride back here.
- Swell.
What's the idea?
-I your moose, Hawkeye-san.
I come back.
-But you're free.
Uh, Hawk, listen.
We're sympathetic, you know, but this kid is part moose, part yo-yo.
Hold it.
Excuse us a second.
Just stand there.
Don't clean anything.
Now, listen.
Tomorrow, we send Ho-Jon into Seoul.
We tell him to find her family.
Brings one of them back here, and then they take her away.
That could take a while.
What do we do until they get here?
Teach her to be something besides a moose.
- Give her person lessons.
- Bingo.
We can start demoosifying her right now.
Is she gonna stay here?
Saint Frank is in Tokyo.
Hawkeye-san make sleep in bed.
I make sleep so- No, no, no.
- You take that bunk there.
- You can't make sleep like that.
I'd like to make a little sleep over here.
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
I'll take the 4:00 feeding.
Okay, once more now.
- Now, we've never met before, right?
- Right.
- Hello.
I'm Dr. Pierce.
- How do you do?
I am Young Hi.
- Very good.
- Morning, Young Hi.
- Hello,Joe.
What you know?
- No.
Forget that.
Will you get lost!
Gee, a person says "good morning" and gets his ear bit off.
Hello there.
I'm Dr. Pierce.
- How do you do?
I am Young Hi.
- Good.
Keep going.
- I am very pleased to meet you.
- Great!

-Pass the sugar, Trapper?
-You can have the sugar from me anytime.
You sit right over there, Young Hi.
- LieutenantJones, Lieutenant Scorch.
- Hi.
How do you do?
I am pleased to meet you.
My name is Young Hi.
-  - Very good!
I am also beautiful.
Yes.
Yes, you are.
And when you meet people, don't look down.
Look them in the eye, and don't back off.
We're all the same.
You get it?
Excuse it.
Not same.
- How do you figure?
- You need shave.
- Hey, Hawkeye.
- Yeah.
Just got word.
Ho-Jon's back.
He brought the head of her family.
That's the man we want to see.
Hey, Ho-Jon.
- That's the head of the family?
- He's Young Hi's brother.
His name is Benny.
Hiya, guys.
How's the action?
An Eagle Scout, he ain't.
- Go get Young Hi, okay?
- Okay.
Did, uh- did Ho-Jon explain to you why we sent for you?
You bought Young Hi from Baker.
Now you want to dump her.
- What's the beef?
She goofing off?
- "The Dead-End Kids" in Korea.
I'll give you this back when you're 50.
- You're here to take your sister home.
- We don't want a moose.
No refund, guys.
You understand that?
- We don't want any money.
She's free to go.
-Just like that?
- You guys are nuts.
-  - Hi, Benny!
- Hey, Young Hi!
How are you, baby?
How do you do?
I am pleased to see you.
How is Mother and Father?
Pop's okay.
Mom's still delivering for the black market.
"One Man's Family.
" They must be treating you okay.
You look real big-time.
Learn many things here.
My English is much more goodly.
- I work in hospital.
- Hey, that's terrifiic.
But you've come to take me?
You come back to Seoul, and we'll get Hold it.
You can't let yourself be sold again.
You guys are brushing her off.
What do you care?
I may get on my knees and punch this kid in the nose.
- You got a chance for a life of your own now.
- No more slobs like Baker.
- What's all this jive?
You know the score.
- I have duty to my family.
- What about your duty to yourself?
- That is not how I was raised.
You tell 'em, baby.
Let's get your gear.
- Young Hi.
- Will you guys lay off?
I remember everything you taught me- everything- and I am grateful.
- We got an " E" for effort.
- That's the way the moose bounces.
- We came close, you know?
- Yeah, for a minute there- Oh, I could use a drink.
A triple, I think.
- I know how to make martini drink.
- Young Hi.
- Are you staying?
- Not only staying, also not going.
I tell Benny most important thing I learn from you: who to tell "shove off"!
.
- Hey!
Terrific!
- Attagirl!
LieutenantJones teach me to make martini drink.
She has much knowledge.
- So have you.
- But Young Hi has something else.
I am also beautiful.
- Hey, we got a letter from Young Hi.
- Yeah?
"I am fine.
I wish you are the same.
I learn much knowledge here in convent school in Seoul.
The sisters say one day maybe I can work as helper to nurse.
I thank once more your efforts and ask God to bless you.
I write that to please the sisters.
I am Buddhist person.
With all love and respect, your friend, Young Hi.
Roger wilco.
" - Roger wilco.
- She's a good kid.
Yeah.
You know something?
I really miss her.
- I wish she was here right now.
- Me too.
Yeah, I could use a shave.
And look at these boots.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Hello.
I'm Brigadier General Crandall Clayton.
As one of thousands of, uh, brave Americans fighting in this scrap here in Korea, I have the honor to command a group of courageous, hardworking medical men- surgeons in uniform using their skill to repair the damage of war.
The film you're about to see is a true case of their service in a great cause.
I'm sure it'll be as inspirational to you as it was to me, their leader.
All right, cut.
Save the lights.
Beautiful.
General, lovely.
You're giving this little documentary real class.
Well, good, Lieutenant.
I wanna cooperate in any way I can.
I appreciate that, sir.
Oh, uh, I even brought that, uh, list you wanted.
Now, look, these are MASH units under my command.
I think I know just the outfit you need- the 4077 th.
Very high fitness record, commanded by a dear friend of mine, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake.
He heads up the best surgical team in the whole damn war.
Real soldiers.
- ## - You dance beautifully.
Thank you.
So do you.
- You're gonna be in town for the whole convention?
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, turn that thing off, will you?
-Just keep shaving, Frank.
- Hey, you're a terrific dipper.
- Oh, yeah.
After 18 hours in an operating room, where do you find the energy?
Can't help it, Frank.
We're the crazy generation.
- Who's been using my razor?
- I cannot tell a lie.
It was I. I told you before to leave my stuff alone.
Oh, Frank, he only used it to shave his legs.
Oh, you guys.
- Aw!
- He's so fresh.
- Ten-hut!
- Hiya, Henry.
- Hiya, Henry.
- At ease, men.
Uh, this is Lieutenant Bricker.
- Lieutenant Bricker, this is Major Burns.
- Hi.
How are you?
- Captain Mclntyre.
- Nice to see you.
- And Captain Pierce.
- How you been?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Uh, surgeon?
Well, I hope so.
We don't need a gynecologist.
No.
Lieutenant Bricker is with Special Services.
He's a movie director.
Well, welcome anyway.
Thank you.
Uh, officers and doctors?
That's what it says on my box of leeches.
Uh, the lieutenant's on, uh, special assignment.
He's making a documentary on MASH units.
And, uh, General Clayton said he couldn't make a better choice than the old 4077 th, huh?
- Was he sober when he said it?
- I wanna tell your story focusing on one doctor, but showing all of you, of course.
Now, any of you done any acting?
Mm!
Mm!
You dirty rat.
You come in here and you ask if we've ever- You dirty rat- if we've ever done any acting.
Why, you dirty- That's not too bad, is it?
I never saw Carmen Miranda done any better.
Now, cut that out.
I've had a little experience, Lieutenant.
Uh, amateur production in college.
I played Romeo.
- And Juliet.
- That's, uh- That's interesting, Major.
Thank you.
As a matter of fact, I did dramatics in high school too.
Why, for a while there, it was a toss-up whether I'd be a doctor or an actor.
- What finally happened?
- Shut him up.
Well, Frank is a fine surgeon and a first-rate officer.
But he's nothing in a tight sweater.
How'd you like to have a shot at this, Captain?
Who, me?
Nah, I'm sorry.
I'm under contract to North Korea as a spy.
Sense of humor, huh?
Moves well.
Good skin tone.
Yeah, but I promised Fred I'd never dance with anybody but him.
It's for the old - Could be laughs.
- Ah, come on.
Well, if you don't do it, he's gonna give it to Frank.
- Okay, that does it.
You got me, Bricker.
- Fine.
We'll start right away.
Gee, I was standing around minding my own business, and all of a sudden, poof, a star is born.
Attention, all personnel.
Attention, all personnel.
Casualties in the compound.
All personnel report on the double.
Start this guy on whole blood, stat.
No.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Uh, cut.
I want a shot of you conferring with another doctor.
You know what I mean?
Talking it over?
Making a decision?
Hey, fella, could you smile a little bit like you got confidence in the doctor?
Get this guy inside and prep him.
We promised MacArthur we'd get the war on schedule.
- Come on.
Try it.
- All right, I got it.
All right, give me a clamp.
Come on.
Give me a clamp.
Another clamp.
Will you move!
Come on!
- That's great, fellas.
Great.
Keep going.
- How you doing?
How you doing?
- I think I got it.
- We need a little more action, something dramatic, huh?
- Hey, Trapper, lift his appendix.
- What?
I think they need a close-up.
In fact, while you're at it, lift his gall bladder.
Maybe you can sing to his appendix.
- Get out of here with that thing!
- Move!
And the secret of making it better is in the hands of fine corpsmen such as you, Corporal Radar O'Reilly of Ottumwa, Iowa.
- Now, cut.
- Well, what was wrong with that one?
- You always wear those glasses?
- Uh, since I was two.
- They're reflecting the lights.
- Oh, isn't that interesting, sir?
- The glasses were reflecting the light.
- Can you see without them?
- See what?
- Never mind.
Keep them on.
- But keep your head down so we don't get any reflection, huh?
- Yes, sir.
Now, look up at the colonel, but keep your head down.
Look up at the colonel, but keep your head down.
Look up at the colonel.
- Oh, what have we here, His-and-hers majors?
- Not interrupting, are we?
No.
Uh, the major was helping me with the narration for the documentary.
- Bricker asked me to do it.
- He's a fantastic performer.
Really?
And can he act too?
- Give us a taste, Frank.
- Yeah.
Oh, come on.
Go ahead, Frank.
Show them.
-  Mm-mm-mm- - Skip that part.
"A group of brave men are at work "in a makeshift operating room "struggling to save your sons and brothers "while outside the dogs of war bark at the door of this sanctuary.
-  - Down, boy!
Down!
Down!
Roll over.
Jump through that.
"These are the saints in surgical garb.
" Dedicated surgeons, all volunteers.
"Every red-blooded American knows "if he is wounded, "he will be in the strong, capable hands of a Yankee Doodle Doctor.
" A Yankee Doodle Doctor!
Stuck a feather in his nurse and called her macaroni - You didn't like it?
- Didn't like it?
Let me count the ways.
That's hardly a constructive criticism.
Oh, you want a constructive criticism.
You're right.
How about "you stink"?
And so does this little movie show and Lieutenant Bricker.
Stinks?
Oh,you-you- Who are you calling a you-you?
Come on, Frank.
We'll rehearse in my tent.
Take it easy, kids.
Save a little something for the show.
Did you hear that garbage?
It's nothing but a bunch of lies.
They're making a fairy-tale documentary.
- "All volunteers.
" - Yeah.
When they came to get me, I was hiding under the front porch trying to puncture my eardrum with an ice pick.
All right, look, we've been had.
The picture's finished, and that's that.
What?
I don't think it's quite finished enough, if you get my drift.
First we get ahold of Radar.
Do you mind if I sit here?
Thank you.
-  -  - Uh, sir?
Do you have a minute?
- For what?
Well, I was wondering if you had any tips for anyone who wanted to get into the movies.
- Uh, another time, maybe, huh?
- Well, how did you get started?
Me?
Hey.
Give me a light over here.
That's it.
Screwdriver.
Wrench.
Ow!
You make a lousy nurse.
Yeah, but it's been tough for me because I won't sell out.
- I mean, I'm a funny kind of guy.
- Oh, are you?
Integrity means more to me than anything.
The right to do what I think is right, no matter what people think.
Spotlight, please.
Moves kind of slow in the beginning, doesn't it?
Well, maybe it gets better as you go along.
- Oh, that's my bad side.
- It looked good to me.
Oh, well - Oh, oh, oh, you were good in that place.
Isn't that good?
- Moves better here.
- Shall we have a double feature?
Where was I?
Oh, you just married your high school teacher.
Wonderful woman.
Helped me a lot with my career.
I wonder if she's still alive.
Th-th-th-th-tha- Th-th-th-th-tha- That's all, folks.
- Ruined.
- It's been exposed to light.
- Every reel.
- All of it?
All of it.
Naturally, I'm worried about all of it.
But, uh, my stuff too?
Well, I mean, I- Your call for General Clayton, sir.
- Did I call General Clayton?
- I called him.
This is my office, Lieutenant.
General Clayton, Henry Blake.
Oh, everything's fine, sir.
Well, uh, not actually fine.
Uh, actually terrible rather than fine.
But I mean, everything was really fine before it got terrible.
- Tell him.
- Well, you see, sir, Lieutenant Bricker shot all of his movie and then someone ruined it.
Yes, sir.
Exposed it.
Well, we don't quite know how.
But it was locked up, and then someone who's very good with his hands and very good with tools, uh, like a surgeon, got- I'll call you right back, sir.
Bricker, come on.
Okay, why'd you do it?
- Do what?
- Do what you did.
What are we supposed to have done that makes you ask if we've done what we did?
You ruined my film.
That's what you did.
Gee, I acted as well as I could.
Oh, don't get cute.
You know what I mean.
You guys opened his cans!
I haven't opened a can since I was an intern.
Now, you can double-talk him all you want.
I know you exposed my film.
That's a very serious accusation, Lieutenant.
And very hard to prove.
Yeah.
Nobody pulls that schoolboy crud on Duane William Bricker.
We start reshooting tomorrow, from the top.
- Fine.
Go ahead.
But do it without me.
- Aw, come on, Pierce.
- I will not work with that man.
- Huh?
- He simply drained me.
- What?
I'm not putting my career in his hands.
Career?
Who do you think you are?
The star of Yankee Doodle Doctor.
- Could I just- - Please, no autographs at this time.
- Has he left yet?
- Save your voice, my darling.
- Hey, let's be sensible, huh?
- Not now, Henry.
I'm going to my dressing room to lie down.
I've met some weirdos in my time, but these two take the cake.
Yeah, but at least it's honest weirdoism, not like that phony footage you shot.
- I'm not through here.
- Then we'll disregard the rumor.
Bricker.
Bricker.
- Uh, listen.
We can work things out.
- Of course we can.
We'll just do the movie without that hotshot.
- Well, uh, I don't think so.
Not really.
- Huh?
Well, you see, Hawkeye Pierce is, uh, warts and all, kind of the heartbeat of this place.
Maybe we can work out a compromise.
Sergeant, get our gear loaded and take the truck to Seoul.
I'll take the next chopper back.
- Is that your idea of a compromise?
- I'm a funny kind of guy.
I never compromise.
I go right to surrender.
Listen.
Do you realize how important that movie would be back home, to our folks?
To see the kind of job we're doing here?
Gee, I told my folks I was, uh, coming over here to avoid making house calls.
Listen.
Crass as it may sound, I mean, it'd be a pretty good plug for us- this movie, back home, you know.
Hey, he's right, you know?
I can just hear them back at the hospital after the war.
"There goes Dr. Pierce.
A fair doctor, but a great profile.
" Now, look.
This monkey's gonna hightail it right to General Clayton and they're gonna make that movie at some other MASH outfit.
That's gonna leave us right out in the cold.
- Aw!
- Oh!
Hey.
Uh, Henry?
- What?
- Can we let Bricker go and keep his camera guy here and all his equipment?
- I think so.
- You still got Bricker's script.
I hope so.
Henry, we can make this movie ourselves.
- You can what?
- We can make it ourselves.
Oh, that's pretty gutsy of you.
Well, "Guts" is my middle name.
Actually, it's " Kinda Disgusting.
" - I mean, you really think you can do it?
- Yeah.
Tomorrow morning we start shooting.
- Come on, Henry.
What do you say?
- Okay, here's to it.
Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake and Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce proudly present Yankee Doodle Doctor.
Where do you come off with top billing?
- Oh.
- Because of your jewelry?
Okay, get a good shot of this, Sergeant.
- I'm getting it.
- Move in closer.
Cut it.
This shot isn't in the script, Captain.
Don't worry about the script, Sergeant.
-Just handle the mechanical details.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, ready?
- Ready to roll.
Action!
- How far away should I get from it when I- - We'll let you know.
Wait a second.
Attention, everybody.
Wait a minute.
Listen.
Now, this scene is when the corpsmen unload Radar and Trapper and I come out and look him over before they take him away.
- All right?
- Right.
Sergeant, put your camera right about there and get us coming out of pre-op.
All right?
Get in the truck, Radar.
All right.
Okay.
-  - All you all right?
- I'm acting.
- What?
- I'm acting!
Attention, all personnel.
Tonight in the Mess Tent at 2100 hours, the movie that could turn Korea into a new Hollywood- Yankee Doodle Doctor, with a cast of several.
The movie that will give you a lump no surgeon can remove.
Ten-hut!
At ease.
Good to see you, Major.
It's been a long time.
Too long, General.
Well, sir, uh, it's just about almost ready now, any minute now, pretty soon, sir.
Excuse me, General.
You'll be sitting over here, sir.
And, uh, Major Burns, you'll be sitting right there.
And Major Houlihan, of course, will be sitting next to the general.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
Quiet!
Now, uh,just a second before we start here to welcome our honored guest, Brigadier General Clayton.
Now, this film that we're all about to see for the first time is the general's baby.
And, of course, we're mighty proud to be able to deliver it.
Well, then, uh, on with the show.
Will you, uh, turn out the, uh, lights, Radar?
Thank you.
Hello.
I'm Brigadier General Crandall Clayton.
Among the thousands of brave Americans fighting in this scrap here in Korea, I have the honor to command a group of courageous, hardworking medical men.
- Very good, sir.
So dramatic.
- Very good, sir.
Shh!
The film you're about to see is a true record of their service in a great cause.
I'm sure it'll be as inspirational to you as it is to me, their leader.
This is the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital somewhere in Korea.
Not a very attractive military post, mainly because the men of the 4077th have no time for anything but the vital work they do.
Hey, Radar!
Hey.
Beautiful.
Just a little medical school humor, sir.
Uh-huh.
Men at the 4077th are on 24-hour duty, always ready to receive those G.I. 's who need medical help.
- Doctor!
Doctor!
Can you give him a hand?
- I'd rather give you one.
Are you the Yankee Doodle Doctor?
- I certainly am.
- - Radar, you're terrific.
Just look at these guys.
- Shh, shh.
Gosh, I'm glad they brought me here.
- Wait a minute.
Have you got a reservation?
- A reservation?
I'm afraid we're all booked up through New Year's.
- - But, Doctor- I'm sorry, kid.
You should've booked ahead.
Come to think of it, you should've booked the rest of the body as well.
What the hell was that?
Brave men struggle in a makeshift operating room while the dogs of war bark at the very door.
Heads up, everybody.
Yankee Doodle Doctor's coming.
Lucky.
- Nurse, is that patient prepared for surgery?
- Yes, Doctor.
- Well, I'm certainly glad one of us is.
-  - Tell me something.
Did you take his pulse?
- Yes, Doctor.
I told you to take his wallet.
First things first.
-  - Let me have a scalpel.
Don't get undressed.
Just give me a scalpel.
That's not a scalpel.
Well, that's not a scalpel.
- Now, that's what I call a scalpel.
-  If this hurts, you'll be the first one to know.
But, Doctor, what about the anesthesia?
No, thank you.
I prefer to be awake through this.
Give him some anesthesia.
You don't have to laugh.
You're unconscious.
You'll be a better man for this, my friend.
Who can spare a tree?
Well, that's enough of that.
I think it's time to do some sewing.
- Sew what?
- That's what I say.
Incision closed, stitches in place.
You're finished, Doctor.
Yes, but who are you to remind me?
Tell me, nurse.
Would you like to hop into the oxygen tent for a little heavy breathing?
- Uh-oh.
Wait a minute.
- Anything wrong, Doctor?
I think I just found my wristwatch.
- Either that or he's giving birth to an alarm clock.
-  How dare you say that in front of a lady.
- Good night, folks.
-   And there are those rare moments when these saints in surgical garb may relax with simple, wholesome pleasure.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, I give you the war.
- Yuck!
-  Yuck!
Yuck!
Yuck!
Three hours ago this man was in a battle.
Two hours ago we operated on him.
He's got a 50-50 chance.
We win some, we lose some.
That's what it's all about.
No promises.
No guaranteed survival.
No saints in surgical garb.
Our willingness, our experience, our technique are not enough.
Guns and bombs and antipersonnel mines have more power to take life than we have to preserve it.
Not a very happy ending for a movie.
But then no war is a movie.
General, I'm very sorry.
I don't know how this happened.
- Absolutely scandalous, General.
Frank- - But please don't worry, sir.
We can do the whole thing over.
There's no need for that, Henry.
It's not all bad.
- Sir?
- Look, save that first bit.
- My introduction?
All of it?
- Yes, sir.
- And that last piece we saw with Captain Pierce talking.
- Yes, sir.
- Burn everything in between.
- Yes, sir.
But save one print for me.
We gotta have something to laugh at when this whole thing is over.
Shall we, my dear?
I'd be happy to.
I think she wanted my autograph.
You can't even talk.
- But I can write.
- Aw, gosh.
You were very good today, Doctor.
Well, another day, another duodenum.
You didn't happen to catch my work in there, did you?
Oh, yes.
But he's the Yankee Doodle Doctor.
It's a privilege to assist him.
Anytime, love.
In fact, maybe even later today.
You know, kids, I've been thinking about my next picture.
I'd like to try something light next time.
Maybe something romantic.
Why don't they ever make pictures like that anymore?
You know, two brothers.
One's a Yankee and the other's a South Korean.
They don't look anything alike, and I play both parts.
Let me tell you about it.
I bet if I played it with a big black hat, I'd look like Lincoln.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
- Give me some more of those sponges.
- You got 'em.
Give me a sponge without a stick.
Mmm.
What, did you send out to the enemy for that sandwich?
Mclntyre.
- Mclntyre.
- Huh?
- What a session.
- Is it Tuesday or Wednesday?
- It's Friday.
- Somebody owes us a Thursday.
Either that or two Wednesdays.
What's that I smell?
Fresh air, if memory serves.
Hey, Radar, what does your ear tell you?
More choppers, ambulances?
The deluge is over.
The enemy's pulled back, and it's gonna take 'em at least a week to regroup.
- You can hear all that?
- I read the report on the colonel's desk.
Hey!
Okay.
Come on.
Let's get something to eat.
Right after we get something to drink.
Is that all you ever think about, drinking?
I don't mind eating if it's possible to make a martini sandwich.
Listen, after having sandwiches stuffed in my ears for three days, I want some steak and potatoes.
On an empty stomach?
Be sensible.
You have to have a martini first.
-Just one.
- One big one.
How big?
- Picture a basketball as the olive.
- Okay.
Boy, have I been looking forward to this.
Darling, we're about to make each other very happy.
- It's dry!
- You can't make 'em dry enough for me.
I mean the still is dry, you knucklehead!
You didn't put the fixings in last night!
- Well, I wasn't here last night!
- That's no excuse!
I mean, it is, but it isn't!
You know what this means?
No martinis!
You should have enough martinis stored in your hump to last you seven days!
And don't call me knucklehead!
What is this?
What's happening to us?
Our first fight.
We're always on the same side.
Yeah.
Us against them.
Whoever the them, we were always us.
You know, if I was to analyze your symptoms, Yeah?
- I would say stress.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Irritability from overwork.
- That's what I got.
And do you know what I would prescribe?
Two days rest and recreation at the R&R center in Tokyo.
Actually, I was thinking about three days.
Well, you're the doctor.
Shall we visit our friendly travel agent?
Here you go, sir.
Oh, gonna do a little outdoor surgery, huh, Henry?
- Nothing wrong with a little relaxation.
- Precisely.
Before you go, we want you to arrange for a few days for us at the R&R center.
- Right.
- I'm late now, guys.
Okay, Radar.
- Now, wait a minute.
- Henry!
Henry, if you don't let us go, they'll take us out of here in a rubber truck.
- If you're leaving, Frank Burns is in charge.
- And he'll never let us out.
Every time you go, he turns into instant Hitler.
- Thank you, Radar.
- You'll just have to work it out.
If I don't get away for a while, I'm gonna start picking flowers off the wallpaper.
- Let go.
- I had a dream last night that I was asleep, and I dreamt it while I was awake!
Are you nuts?
Move out.
Were you acting?
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Lieutenant, check the patient in bed number five, hmm?
I, uh, let him write a letter to his mother, but I think it may have been too much for him because I don't like the way he's breathing.
Yes, Doctor.
Hawkeye, could I have a word with you?
If it's the one I want to hear.
Listen, maybe I've been unfair.
I mean, you've asked me out so many times and- Well, I'm not on duty tonight, so, well, I was wondering- You can stop wondering.
You're about to face reality.
Wait a minute.
What did you have in mind?
Whatever you have in mind.
What?
Lieutenant, if I didn't know you better, I'd be hurt.
- But, Hawkeye- - I know what you want, what they all want.
You think just because a guy smiles at you and lets you get in front of him in chow line, he's a pushover.
Well, let me tell you something, Lieutenant.
Forget it!
I'm not that kind of a boy.
- I'm worried about Hawkeye.
- Well, I wouldn't be.
- He does very well looking after himself.
- Very well.
That's exactly the point.
He's not himself.
- What does that mean?
- He seems to be losing touch with reality.
I think the last person we have to worry about - is Hawkeye Pierce.
- I second that.
-  - ##   - Were you just in surgery?
- ##  I'd rather not say.
All right, what's all that funny business there?
There's nothing funny here to me, Frank.
I happen to be very serious about this delicious piece of liver.
- ##  - Liver?
Where did you get liver?
They're serving hamburger.
This is mine, and you can't have any.
Okay, okay.
But where did you get it?
From that North Korean.
What North Korean?
The- You mean the one that- The one that croaked.
You didn't.
He was very clean.
You must be loony!
Now, what is this?
If you want to join me for breakfast, we can have a stack of pancreas.
You touched my plate!
You're not sterile!
You've ruined my liver!
Ruined it!
And we're all out of North Koreans!
- Stop it!
Stop it!
- Are you crazy or something?
I don't think I needed that.
Radar.
- Take him back to the swamp and give him the blue pill.
- Yes, sir.
Don't touch me.
Filthy liver thief.
Well, Frank?
Well, I know we've all been working desperately hard, but Pierce has always been a rock.
Let me take him to Tokyo for some R&R before he cracks up any further!
Frank, I'm the only one that can handle him.
I'll make the arrangements.
You know, Pierce was saying only this morning what a- what a considerate, intelligent human being you are.
He has flipped.
I've made my decision.
Why do I still feel so uneasy?
Because we both know what operators they are.
How about this?
I have a psychiatrist friend in the 423rd Evac.
Phil Sherman.
He's been crazy about me for years.
Hmm.
"Crazy.
" Isn't that funny?
I don't think anybody being crazy about you is funny, Margaret.
Frank, you're jealous.
Jealous?
I envy anyone that comes close to you.
I envy the fly that walks across your upper lip.
- I envy the cotton tips you stick in your ears.
I- - Frank, the point is, Sherman's a brilliant psychiatrist, and if anybody can spot a phony- Do you see what I'm getting at?
My blue heaven In a few hours, I'm gonna be in the arms of somebody I haven't even met yet.
I'll drink to that.
##  Uh, Hawkeye?
"By order of Major Frank Burns, acting commanding officer, - Oh, yeah?
-  "Captain B.F. Pierce will make himself available tomorrow morning for an examination by Captain Philip G. Sherman- Sherman.
" What kind of an examination?
- "Psy-chi-atric.
" - Psy-chi-atric?
Well, you can just tell your psy-chi-atrist that I'm not gonna be here.
Yeah, tell him to start without him.
We're gonna be in a hotel in Tokyo.
Oh, the bellhops are here.
This is a nice room.
Yeah, I, uh, I stay here all the time.
Well, thanks, fellas.
I'll just slip into something comfortable.
I think they're waiting for a tip.
- This way, sir.
- Captain Sherman.
- Margaret, I so- - Uh, excuse me, Captain.
- Take the captain's bags to the visiting officers' tent.
- Yes, sir.
- Ma'am.
- Sir?
- Dismissed.
- Yes, sir.
- It's been a long time.
- San Diego.
I waited for you in the bar until 4:00 a. m. You never came.
- I said I wouldn't.
- You didn't lie.
I think you'd better see Captain Pierce right away.
Captain, for me to do my job, I've got to know what's bothering you, if anything.
So the sooner you trust me, the sooner I'm gonna be able to help you.
Oh, I trust you.
Why wouldn't I trust you?
- That's a very healthy attitude.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- To be sure.
- Right.
- Wrong.
Beg your pardon?
Oh, I was associating freely.
I thought you'd expect that.
- Fine.
- And dandy.
- Doctor- - Nurse.
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.
No.
We're not going to do that.
Oh, well, whatever you say.
- Pierce- - Arrow.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Listen, we're both professional men.
Let's get right to it.
What's your problem?
I appreciate your forthright approach.
I'm gonna level with you.
I'm in love.
That's nice, I'm sure.
But it doesn't explain your rather erratic behavior of late.
Well, maybe it's because I'm in love and he doesn't even know I exist.
Did you say "he"?
I'm relying on your professional discretion.
Of course.
Who is it?
- Frank Burns.
- Major Burns?
Frank.
Tell me about him.
You don't know what it's been like living together in the same tent month after month and having him think of me as just another guy.
Go on, please.
If only he knew I sleep every night with his shaving brush under my pillow.
I always try to operate at the same table he does.
Somehow I feel sharing a casualty brings us closer together.
Of course.
But he's only got eyes for Hot Lips.
That would be Major Houlihan?
You know she dyes her hair blonde?
- Oh?
- Oh, yeah.
That's why I dyed my hair black.
I think Frank should have a clear choice.
Keep talking, Doctor.
Do you think a girl should throw herself at him like that?
I mean, I realize I'm only a captain and he's a major.
But after all, fair is fair.
Don't you agree?
Anything new develop while I was gone, Radar?
- Oh, nothing much, sir.
- Good.
Just Captain Pierce all of a sudden went bananas, and they had to call in a psychiatrist.
- They what?
- There's a latrine-o-gram going around that he might be shipped out to the laughing academy.
Oh, he's beautiful.
- You have that head doctor- - I'll tell Captain Sherman to see you.
Captain Sherman, do you- Captain Sherman, you know Major Houlihan and Major Burns.
- Major.
Major.
- Captain.
Well, sit down.
Sit down.
Thank you.
The captain thinks that Pierce is a candidate for the funny farm.
Now, we all know what a practical joker he is.
So, Frank, why don't you tell us about the time that, when you were asleep, Pierce tied your big toes to the bed frame and then yelled, "Fire"?
Oh, I'd rather not, sir.
Well, then tell him about the time he sedated you and then set both your arms and legs in plaster and hung you from the ceiling in traction ropes.
And- And how when you came to, you thought- you thought you had four broken limbs.
Then Pierce came in, you see, and cut him down.
Frank, I tell you, I will never forget the terror in your eyes, that look just before you hit the bed!
Do you remember that one, Frank?
I don't think I'll ever forget it, sir.
- We certainly won't.
- Pierce did that?
- Yeah.
- I don't think he should get those three days of R&R.
- Neither do I. - I agree.
Colonel, I'm taking him with me to Tokyo tomorrow.
- You're gonna what?
- I think Captain Pierce can use a few weeks of observation.
Well, wait a minute.
I mean, what if I never get him back?
- We'll do the best we can.
- This is the army.
Nobody can do the best they can.
Now, Frank, tell him how wrong he is, that Pierce is just pulling a fast one.
Or we're gonna lose him.
They're gonna take him away.
Tell him, Frank.
Frank, tell him.
Major Houlihan, you tell him.
You mean poor Hawkeye?
What "poor" Hawkeye?
Poor, sick Hawkeye?
Sick, sick, sick.
Observation?
The only thing I want to observe in Tokyo is what a good time I'm having.
- You need tests.
- Oh, come on!
You know I was only putting you on about Frank Burns.
Of course.
But you have done some pretty bizarre things.
Gee, I can't imagine why.
I'm 12,000 miles away from home, sewing together soldiers who aren't old enough to shave, while people I don't know keep dropping bombs on the building where I work, which has a big red cross painted on the roof.
Maybe I should just hire a band and have the whole thing catered.
Easy, Captain.
We'll be leaving in the morning.
That's an order.
Didn't anything ever get you, Captain, any situation that was thrust upon you in which you didn't come out smelling like a well-adjusted rose?
Not much chance of that, Captain.
My sense of reality is my gyroscope.
Whatever the situation, it keeps me right on course.
You're a lucky man.
- I'm speaking, of course, in the past tense.
-Just relax.
Uh, Radar.
- What's up?
- A mission you just volunteered for.
I was just on my way to the shower.
Well, you waited this long.
Do you mind if I sit here, sir?
No, not at all, Corporal.
Thank you.
That's very kind of you.
- Would you like some soup, sir?
- No.
No, thank you.
Why do you keep doing that?
It's Major Houlihan, sir.
She keeps looking over here, and then when you look over, she turns away.
Really?
Major Houlihan?
Does that surprise you, sir?
Just this afternoon, I heard her saying in the women's shower how great she thinks you are.
What were you doing in the women's shower?
Actually, I was on the outside, fixing a hole in the tent.
I'm sure she was talking about somebody else.
- What did she say?
-  Well, thank you very much for your advice, sir.
I'll be sure to send home for that book by Sergeant Freud.
- That's Sigmund Freud.
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Night.
- Good night, sir.
- - Uh, there's no light.
Is that so, sir?
Oh, must be a burned-out bulb.
- I could scrape one up for you.
- Unnecessary.
My profession is helping people find their way in the dark.
- Oh, yes, sir!
-  Very good, sir.
Idiotic supply sergeant.
- - Ow!
It's true.
It's true!
- Let me do that.
-    Oh, pardon me.
I thought I heard somebody yell for help.
Carry on.
Carry on, hell!
I did yell for help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
- It's all right, baby.
- All right for who?
Get off me, you animal!
- Margaret, it's me, Philip!
-  Captain Sherman!
- Margaret!
- It is not me!
I mean, I wouldn't have anything to do with this pervert, this sex maniac!
Margaret, it's all a horrible mistake!
I've been victimized!
Is that what you call it?
Lying in the dark, - waiting to spring on an innocent young girl?
- I'm innocent!
It was that little guy with the soup!
It's all a frame-up!
A frame-up?
You're living in a fool's paranoid.
What the Sam Hill is going on in here?
She wanted me.
I mean I thought she wanted me.
- I'm a very controlled person.
- Of course you are.
You're just having a little gyroscope trouble.
A little trouble with your what?
- Can I get out of here?
- First thing in the morning.
-  - No!
Tonight!
- Even better.
- Right.
- I'll pack you some bananas.
- And I'll get you some crackers and nuts.
Good-bye, Margaret.
- Oh, driver!
Yoo-hoo!
- Driver!
Well, here you go, men.
One full week of R&R.
- Well, if I say so myself, we earned 'em.
- Yes, indeedy.
- Now, don't forget the deal.
- If you need us, we're only a phone call away.
- - Choppers.
Here they come!
Attention, all personnel.
- - Incoming casualties!
Report immediately to admitting ward and operating room.
On the double!
Do me a favor.
Keep the motor running until the war is over.
And don't stop the meter.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Attention!
Attention!
Casualties arriving on the pad.
We've got another delivery from the Cowboy.
Hawkeye.
Hawkeye!
I'm gonna count to one, and then you'd better be out of here.
Sir, I hate to wake you- How would you like me to take out your tonsils through your ear?
You're needed in surgery.
That figures.
Ten minutes sleep a week oughta be enough for anybody.
I'd give anything to be able to see the inside of my eyelids.
Cowboy just got back from another run.
- Doesn't that guy ever sleep?
- He will now.
He's been hit in the shoulder.
- Get us some coffee.
- Anything else?
Yeah, two blondes, sunny side up.
- Not the Cowboy again.
- Same guy, different shoulder.
I'm thinking of putting in zippers.
- Is he gonna be all right?
- Unless somebody shoots him in here.
What do you think, Father?
Should I sign it?
- This is the one the Cowboy brought in?
- Yeah.
He lost a lot of blood.
"Goldstein.
" Think he'd mind?
Funny.
He doesn't look it.
Amen.
Whatever you say, Father.
Ah, I see the mark of the mad butcher.
- How do they feel?
- They hurt like hell.
Then I'll cancel your tango lessons.
I'm serious, Doc.
What do you think of my legs?
Well, I'm a fanny man myself.
But I'm sure you'll be walking around in two weeks.
- Oh, that's great.
- Oh, yeah, we do quality work here.
Well, Cowboy, the Indians struck again.
Shoot, I been hurt worse rollin' a cigarette.
When do I get out of here?
A few days.
Can I get you anything?
Would you check on the mail?
I been expecting a letter.
I think the Pony Express has been through already.
Something wrong?
It could be, but it ain't nothin' I can fix from here.
Say, is this thing bad enough I can get sent home?
Even for a little while?
I'll see what I can do.
- Come on, Frank!
Out of the way!
- You're not going anywhere.
This jeep is the property of the United States Army in general, and Colonel Blake in particular, and as such is to be used for the official duties thereof and nothing else.
Frank, you're suckin' around to become a hit-and-run case.
- Move!
- Over my dead body.
Great idea.
- I dare you.
- Now, listen, Frank- Yeah?
I have just completed three straight days of surgery without rest, and this nurse and I are going out and do some nature study.
So if you don't wanna become a hood ornament, you'd better move!
What's going on here?
What is all the gaff?
- Colonel Blake, this man is about to pilfer your jeep.
- Is that right, Mclntyre?
No, sir, I was not pilfering.
I was stealing.
Listen, haven't I got enough problems without your- - Sir?
- Not now, Radar.
Now, I assume you have a good reason for wanting the jeep.
- He has not.
- I'm talking to him.
- Sir?
- No!
- Mclntyre- - Look, Henry.
It's my curve ball.
It's hangin'.
Won't come in over the plate.
This here's my pitching coach.
She may not look it, but she's already straightened out my screw ball.
She's got great stuff.
- Nurse, out.
"Disenjeep.
" - Hold it!
And you, Captain, you will have to find some other means of transportation.
I am not running a personal taxi service.
Ha ha.
- Knock it off, Burns.
- Sir.
Police that butt, soldier.
- Sir, you wanna sign this?
- I don't wanna sign anything.
You sign it.
Sir, would you sign that I signed?
I'll sign that.
- Comfy?
- Hey, you got a minute, Henry?
Oh, yeah, I got a lot of minutes, and each one is worse than the one before.
Ah-ah-ah.
Don't get up.
Let me just pretend that you're in charge of this nut house.
- I got a problem.
- Who is she?
Cowboy's X-ray.
We cleaned a mess of shrapnel out of his right shoulder.
I think we should give him a ticket stateside.
It doesn't look all that serious.
Yeah, but I think he's got something at home that is.
Well, who doesn't?
I left a going practice and a wife with a fistful of credit cards.
Come on, Henry, show me there's a heart under that dirty T-shirt.
Not this time, Pierce.
He's gonna be very unhappy.
Well, I don't remember the draft board promising any of us a lot of laughs.
Then your final word is no?
Either that or good-bye.
It's multiple choice.
What are you doing here?
Catching up on my sulking.
- Thought you had a date with a nurse.
- Two.
One for this afternoon, and one tonight - the season's first doubleheader.
- So what happened?
- Game called on account of Henry.
Took away my wheels.
Taste that.
- He just turned me down on letting Cowboy go home.
- He's going sour on us.
Maybe he needs some relaxation.
This place is eating away his brain, which, I grant you, is only an hors d'oeuvre.
Okay, Henry, you may have the honor.
Um, which way is the course?
Uh, out there.
Trapper and I laid this out ourselves.
This is the first hole.
- You see that flag out there?
- Uh-uh.
Uh, at about 3 o'clock.
Pretty far away, isn't it?
It's a par 29.
The mine fields are out of bounds on the left, and the Chinese communists are out of bounds on the right.
Why don't you hit first?
You're the boss.
Nice ball.
- Ball's okay.
- Yeah.
Swing's a little strange, but the ball looked good.
Oh, me.
Terrific!
Very nice, Henry.
Very good.
Well, what do you think I oughta use from here?
- You oughta use all you got.
- Oh, yeah?
How far is it?
From this bush, about a half a mile.
Uh, Ho-Jon, give me the two wood, please.
- You know, Pierce, this is really a great idea.
- That's the only kind to get.
I'm really starting to unwind.
That's great.
I'm glad.
What the hell was that?
I don't know, but you'll have to take a stroke.
- But I can't even find my ball.
- Then that's two strokes.
I don't see anything.
Maybe it was a sniper.
Coming from the camp?
Maybe a ricochet.
Shall we continue?
No, no, I'll concede the hole, and the game, and maybe the whole day.
Let's not quit, Henry.
We're out here for your nerves.
We can leave.
I got 'em.
Colonel!
-  Oh, no!
-  Colonel.
- What happened?
- Come on, move over.
Jeep through my tent.
What'd he say?
Jeep tent through.
Ajeep must've rolled loose and broke through his tent.
Why, he might've been killed.
-  - Oh, come on, sir.
I'll fix you up.
Come on, sir.
Jeep tent crash kill.
Jeep, crash, kill.
Yes, sir.
-Jeep.
Tent.
-Jeep?
Tent?
- Through.
Kill.
- Through, kill.
Yes, sir.
-Jeep crash.
-Jeep crash.
- Tent boom crash kill.
- Tent boom.
Yes, sir.
Okay, Trapper, don't think I don't know what you think I don't know.
Would you translate that, please?
You wouldn't be the first man in the army who tried to kill his commanding offiicer.
Steady, Henry.
Your glue is melting.
Just because I wouldn't let you use my jeep.
Wait a minute, Henry.
Trapper may be insane, but he's not crazy.
Oh, yeah?
Where were you this afternoon, Mclntyre?
Over at the supply tent doin' a hundred-yard dash with a nurse.
And what about tonight?
Where were you tonight when that jeep went through my quarters?
-When the what went through your where?
-He was right here.
Oh, yeah?
And just where is "here"?
Here is where we are.
Oh.
This here here?
Henry.
Henry.
Are you all right?
- All right.
Tent smashed.
- You can sleep here tonight.
-Jeep.
Tent.
- Yeah.
-Boom.
Crash.
-Okay,just come over here and lie down.
- Henry- Henry, wait a minute.
- Henry!
- Does Henry have an enemy?
- Doesn't sound like the work of a friend.
We'd better keep an eye on him.
- Now?
- I don't think he's got a later.
Come on.
- Why don't you go check in the office.
- Right.
I found him.
Boom.
Radar.
Radar?
- Hello?
- It's me, Colonel.
- Who?
- Radar.
Radar, sir.
- Where are you?
- Uh, here, sir, in your outer office.
Well, what- what are you- What are you doing out there?
Uh, no offense, sir, but I've got this thing about living.
Did you fill out the fitness reports?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, bring 'em in so I can sign 'em.
Yes, sir.
Good-bye, sir.
-  - G- Good-bye.
Yeah?
Mmm, will that be all, sir?
Woodward.
- Nurse Baker.
- Thank you.
Pierce.
Mulcahy.
- Goldstein.
- Yeah!
And Sullivan.
Don't worry.
It'll get here.
One week, she ain't written.
You're welcome to mine.
It's an invitation to a great party - last month.
She's probably off with some rodeo rider.
She's a sucker for a ten-gallon hat.
If I could just get home.
- You ever see any snakes?
- Not while I'm sober.
I could shoot the eyes out of a rattler at 50 feet going at a full gallop.
Of course, the army has its own kind of snakes.
T-That's far enough, sir.
- You ready for dinner?
- Fix those chops for me?
Stuffed 'em specially.
Here you go, sir.
Hiya, Henry.
Aren't you guys afraid of sitting with me?
Nah, we figure you're safe in daylight.
That's very encouraging.
You sure that food's all right?
Huh?
- You don't think somebody- - Let me taste it for you, huh?
- We're worried about you.
- Welcome to the club.
If anything happens to you, Frank Burns takes over.
Boy, your unselfishness is touching.
We figure the best thing for you to do is clear out for a while.
Walk away from my post?
No, run away from your post.
You're taking a big chance hanging around here, and you're driving morale into the ground.
Well, there are a few things I could do down in Seoul.
Pack up your gear.
I'll get somebody to drive you.
Here you are, Henry.
Nothing wrong with it.
Now, you'll find a set of master keys- - See 'em?
- Mm-hmm.
Radar has duplicates in the company safe.
Don't worry, sir.
I'll have this place back into shape in no time.
Who says this place is out of shape?
Don't drive everybody nuts, Frank.
No snap inspections.
You understand?
And no parades.
Well, that's not a very military attitude.
Listen, Frank, the only thing G.I. about me is my athlete's foot.
Just keep this hospital running.
Yes, sir.
Now, uh,  over here is the, uh, duty roster.
- See 'em?
- Mm-hmm.
And, uh, in here are your transmitter codes.
- See 'em?
- Mm-hmm.
This- Well, this bottom drawer is filled with personal stuff, and there's no sense in opening that.
- It'll just be a few days.
Everything will be fine.
- I'm sure it will.
Well, it's all yours.
Hey, where is Hawkeye?
I feel like a sitting duck out there.
He's trying to get you a driver.
There are not too many kamikaze types around here.
Word's out you're takin' off, Colonel.
Just a few days down in Seoul.
That jeep'll take you half a day.
I could fly you down there in no time.
- You strong enough to fly?
- I thought we'd do it by chopper.
- Hey, that's great.
Great.
- Well, let's go.
Hey, Trapper, would you believe me if I said I was gonna miss you?
- No.
- Smart fella.
Thanks for your help.
Have fun, Henry.
I smelled the gunpowder.
It's pretty hard not to.
And I found the wiring and the alarm clock bits.
Cowboy's in the booby trap business.
We'd better find him, and Henry.
I'm afraid I know where they are.
You comfy, Colonel?
Most comfortable I've been in days.
Good.
Real good.
You just sit back and relax.
Say, uh, shouldn't I have a parachute too?
You don't need one, sir.
It'll only break your fall.
That's not funny.
Neither was your not letting me go home.
-  - Hawkeye!
- Not now, Radar.
- Okay, it's cookin'.
- Sir- - Get lost.
You told me to keep an eye open for this.
It's a letter for the Cowboy.
If you were any taller, I'd kiss you on the lips.
Purple Rider, Purple Rider.
Come in, Purple Rider.
Can you read me?
You're gonna get us both killed, Cowboy!
This is crazy!
Purple Rider, over.
Come on, Cowboy.
I know you can hear me.
- We can hear you.
Talk to them.
- I will, as soon as you're gone.
Cowboy, you've gotten a letter from home.
Nice try, Trapper.
We're not jiving you, Cowboy.
What's the name on the letter?
Mrs. Jean Hodges.
Jean.
Isn't that your wife's name?
Jean?
Right.
What's the address?
Box 743-  Reno.
Good-bye, Henry.
I can't hear you.
It, uh- It might say Reno, but we really can't tell.
Reno!
That's right!
That's where I live!
What a lovely town.
Cowboy, how is Col.
Blake?
- Henry, are you all right?
- I'm in real trouble.
Open it up.
Let's hear it.
"Dear John-" Go on!
That's my real name!
DearJohn from Reno.
"Sometimes when you're away from someone you thought you loved, "you find yourself tested by being tempted.
"That's what has happened to me.
Dear, dearJohn-" Wow, a double DearJohn.
"I was tempted "and I didn't want to write until I knew whether I'd passed the test.
"If I say I love you more than ever, "will it tell you how I did and that I'm completely worthy of the most wonderful guy in the world"?
Cowboy?
Let's go home, Cowboy.
Let's go home.
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Henry.
-Just in time for the cocktail hour.
Pull up an olive.
- Good.
From the Cowboy.
Base hospital in Lakeland.
- It was a classic combination of combat fatigue and worry.
He'll be okay.
- His wife's joined him, and he's going home for a month's leave.
- I do like a happy ending.
- Tell us the truth, Henry.
- Were you scared up there with the Cowboy?
- Me?
Are you kidding?
- I know how to take care of myself.
- Just asking, Henry.
Just asking.

#In some secluded rendezvous # That overlooks the avenue - Clamp.
- Clamp.
With someone sharing a delightful Chat of this and that And cocktails for two - Hawkeye, shut up, will you?
- Yeah, shut up.
Thank you, music lovers.
- Rib cutter.
- Rib cutter.
- How's it going?
- We're ahead on points.
- Suture.
- Suture.
The Lord helps in one way or another.
That's cat gut.
The wound was infected.
I assumed you didn't want silk.
Lieutenant, you're not here to assume.
Settle down, Frank.
Forget it.
Carry on.
Yes, sir, I'm- I'm working.
Working?
He could be arrested for loitering in front of an operating table.
- Did you hear that, Colonel?
- Pipe down, Pierce.
Hello, you beautiful day.
- Whoo.
Hoo-hoo.
- Sometimes you gotta throw back some of the young ones.
Man!
How 'bout a rubdown?
- Where did you find her?
- Right there.
- You boys look a little tired.
- Here's our gallant leader.
- Henry was terrific in there.
- Wasn't he good?
- Well, I must tell you guys that was some fancy cutting in there.
- Thank you, Henry.
Colonel!
- Yes, Frank?
- I intend to file insubordination charges against Ginger Bayliss.
Insubordination on account of a suture?
You're kidding, Doctor?
And I use the term because it always gets a laugh.
- Sir?
- Not now, Radar.
You just keep pushing around the medical staff, you see what happens.
- Are you threatening a superior officer?
- Now, hold it!
-Frank, I'll be in my office in an hour.
-Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- Uh, sir.
- Now I'll talk Frank out of it, but you lay off him, all of you.
He's a good surgeon and we need him.
Pierce, one day he's gonna throw the book at you - and I won't be there to help.
- I have a message from General Hammond.
Radar, don't interrupt, unless it's a message from General Hammond.
Yes, sir.
- Are we surrendering?
- Hey, listen to this.
"The 4077 th has now achieved a 90% efficiency rating.
"The best record of any medical unit operating in Korea.
Congratulations on a fine performance.
Gen.
Hammond.
" - How do you like them apples?
- You have another hit on your hands.
They'll be dancing in the street.
A record unmatched by any other medical unit in Korea.
And in recognition of this splendid achievement, it is now my personal pride to award to Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake the Special Citation of Merit, Fourth Class.
May I have the envelope, please?
Hey, look at Henry.
He looks like he's gonna have a baby.
Thank you, General.
Thank you.
Um, well, this comes as a complete surprise to me.
I- I don't know what to say.
I haven't prepared an acceptance speech.
No man wins an award like this on his own.
You people, you great doctors and you swell gals who made this possible are just too numerous to mention.
But I'm mighty grateful to all of you, right down to my right hand, Corporal Radar O'Reilly.
Who, incidentally, is in command of this unit and just uses me as a front.
Standing here today proud as punch, I, uh- I think back to the time when I first considered a career in medicine back in Bloomington, Illinois.
Our family doctor, a nice old codger who drove a touring car that had the Isinglass curtains.
Uh, he said to me, - Excuse me, Colonel.
- " Excuse me, Colonel.
" - I have one more announcement.
- I'm sorry.
There's a service charge on the award.
Colonel Blake's experience is needed elsewhere for administrative and training duties.
Now he's being assigned to Tokyo Medical Headquarters, effective immediately.
Well, fine.
Then I'll keep in touch with you on that.
- And I know you have to go right over to O.R. - Yeah.
- Guys.
- Henry, bon voyage.
Well, thank you.
Uh, normally I'd soak this in a pail of water, - but this being my last day.
- Actually, it's a prescription for your health.
Have it filled in Tokyo.
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- We're gonna miss you, Chief.
Your fighting spirit, your little moods.
- Your cheerful smile.
- Your loyalty.
- Oh, fiddle faddle.
- Your gift for language.
Yeah, well, uh- The, uh, truth of the matter is that, uh, I'll miss you delinquents too.
Uh, you're the two finest cutters I've ever been associated with.
Well, uh, Henry, I, uh- I guess this is it.
- Yeah.
- I don't know what to say.
- Try, "Thanks for the memories.
" - Yeah.
- Colonel, I- - Whoa, whoa.
Allow me, Major.
Don't wanna hurt those magic fingers.
What is this?
"Army Manual.
Thoughts Before the Battle.
A 1001 Jokes for the Offiicer's Mess.
" He's got everything here but Clausewitz on Hernia.
- Give me back my books!
- Sorry.
Your books?
Hey, where's he goin'?
-He's taking his things into your house.
-Yeah, well, uh, that's Frank's quarters now.
- Frank's quarters?
Him?
- He's our new boss?
Well, he's next in command, you see?
Almost forgot your equipment, sir.
- Oh, thank you, Radar.
Is that it?
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Well, I'll be moving along then.
Now, I know you guys are gonna be very happy.
Now look.
You're all surgeons and this is gonna work out fine.
Now why don't you go over and make Frank feel at home?
Uh, sir, it's been a privilege serving under you.
I hope we see each other real soon.
Yes, Radar, well I- I was, um- Uh- Well, gee.
Crazy monkey.
Move out.
Let's get out of here.
Sir, here's the three copies of the mess requistion forms you wanted for next week, and also six copies of the supply room application forms.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, put them on the desk, corporal.
- Yes, sir.
- Good night, sir.
- O'Reilly.
Where are you going?
We have work to do.
- Sir, it's 2:00 in the morning.
- You're not going to bed until this office is 100% shipshape.
Aye, aye, sir.
I assure you, all goldbricking that went on here under Col.
Blake is going to stop.
Under my command, life is going to be a different kettle of fish.
- Are you sure you're in the right branch of the service?
- Don't be snotty.
- Bring me the- - Fitness reports.
Not the fitness reports.
You can't anticipate what I'm thinking.
- I'm not Henry Blake.
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry.
- I want the efficiency reports.
- Efficiency reports.
Here's tomorrow's routine.
See that it's posted.
- They're not gonna like this.
- I didn't come here to be liked.
You certainly came to the right place.
I could swear I heard a bugle.
It is a bugle.
Hey, I think we're in the army.
" Reveille" has blown, sirs!
All right, let's look alive- Everybody!
Hup, ho.
Hup, ho.
Hup, ho.
Altogether.
Hup, ho.
- - Hawkeye.
Hawkeye.
It's an emergency.
Major Burns is making a surprise inspection.
- An inspection?
- Yeah.
- What's "inspection"?
- That, gentlemen, is something they do in the army.
- What's that got to do with us?
- Yeah!
He's coming with an aide and an M.P. Well, we're ready.
- If he wants to inspect a garbage dump, that's up to him.
- Yeah.
Ten-hut!
Good morning, gentlemen.
At ease.
The condition of this tent is a disgrace.
- Yeah, well, it does have that lived-in look.
- Mm-hmm.
Actually, it's modeled on the Chicago sewer system.
We saw it in a magazine.
And look at all of you- unshaven, out of uniform.
Yes, but with a song in our hearts.
Sergeant, put these men on report- beds unmade, personal effects in disorder, furnishings in nonregulation condition.
Here, here!
While I'm commanding officer, you're not going to operate a distillery on this base.
- Sergeant, get that still outta here!
- Hold it!
Nobody takes our gin machine.
- Take it out.
That's an order!
- You watch it, buddy.
This thing might go off.
He's got the drop on us, Tex.
We can't do a thing.
Now maybe you'll realize who's running this outfit.
You straighten up and fly right, or I promise you there'll be hell to pay.
He actually took our still.
He's not a nice person.
Gentlemen, that man has got to go.
It's either him or us.
- And that's final.
- How we gonna do it?
Shoot him?
- Stab him.
- Poison him.
No, no.
We gotta think this over.
We have to give it careful, considerate, intelligent thought.
- Okay.
- Then we'll shoot him, stab him or poison him.
It's very simple.
We just have to figure out the destruction of one of our colleagues, Major Frank Burns, U.S. Army surgeon and rat.
- Yeah.
- Any ideas?
We could get hold of some orders, forge the general's signature and send him back to the States.
- No, that's no good.
They'd send him right back.
- It'd work for a while.
How you feel about offin' him?
Let's try to avoid the more obvious cliches.
I think we need something basic.
Why don't we push him in front of a chopper with the blades goin'?
- That's basic.
- We haven't had a good decapitation in a long time.
Crude.
Very crude, but I like it.
It's interesting.
Let's table the beheading for the time being.
What else do you got?
- Look.
- What?
Tell him he's got a hot appendix, get him on the table.
- Yeah?
- I'll give him anesthesia.
And, uh, that's it.
- That's it?
- You're not a very creative person, UglyJohn.
- Never claimed to be.
- I have a question.
- What?
Radar's got a question.
- After we get rid of Major Burns, then what?
That's an important point, you know that?
Yeah.
They could send out a surgeon who's even more gung-ho than Frank.
Might be he won't even be a surgeon.
Could be some dermatologist with pull in the War Department.
- So what's the answer?
- I don't know.
What is the answer?
- You know what the answer is?
Henry.
-  Henry!
-When were all of us really happy here?
-When the nurses were new.
We were happy when Henry was in command.
He understood us, we understood him.
- He was one of us.
- You'd insult a man behind his back?
We had a mature, grown-up relationship.
We had him by the throat.
So why would Henry let himself be transferred back here?
- Ego.
- Ego?
Ego.
The basic desire we all have to be needed.
Look.
I got an idea, but I'll need a couple of passes to Tokyo.
Okay, let's see what we got.
- " Hardship leave: sister pregnant.
" - Don't see those anymore.
- "Transfer to Germany.
" - You got a bacon, lettuce, tomato on rye, hold the mayo?
Very funny.
Two passes to Tokyo.
Should have looked under "T" in the first place.
Gentlemen, with these I promise you peace in our time.
Fantastic.
Cho-Cho, you are one of the great soap artists.
Thank you, Colonel san.
You people really have some fun-type customs.
Mind if we swim through?
- I thought you guys had drowned.
- No,just resting on the bottom.
Yeah, that's what we're all doing- resting on the bottom.
- There's that fabulous sense of humor again.
- Henry, we really missed it.
Yeah.
Hey, how are things going back at the ranch?
- Well, kind of slow right now.
- That's why we forged a couple of passes.
You know, Frank's signature is almost as easy to copy as yours?
Well, you certainly seem to be suffering here, Henry.
I give my three lectures a week, and then my time's my own.
And I don't exactly sit around my room playing the kazoo.
Pleasures of the flesh, Henry.
And after all, Henry,you deserve all this.
You built a great surgical unit.
No matter what Frank Burns is doing to it.
Who cares if morale is down to zero and that everybody's beginning to hate each other?
Who cares about the 90% efficiency rating, now down to 32?
Well, that's war.
Oh, by George, that feels good.
I tell you, this little lady's got golden feet.
Honey, hit that scapula real hard, will you?
I've got some calcium deposits back there.
- Yeah.
- Will you stop groaning a minute and listen?
I have been listening, and you still don't make sense.
I'm not going back to that rat hole.
What about the people you left back in that rat hole, huh?
Yeah, your friends, the people who love you.
Oh, come on, man.
All the time I was up there, I slept with a loaded gun under my pillow.
I'd have been safer in North Korea.
Henry, have you ever given one single thought to Leslie?
Oh!
Honey, take it easy on the pelvic girdle.
I've only got one of those, you know.
You know, since you're gone, Leslie is a basket case.
Okay, she'll get over it.
I'll tell you what.
- I'll send her an Obi coat or one of those hand-painted fans.
- Come on, Henry.
- You're trying to buy your way out of that relationship?
- Yeah.
Okay, I'll send her a " DearJane" letter, all right, but I stay here.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake Baked a cake Baked a cake If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake How do you do, How do you do How do you do Had you dropped me a letter I'd have hired a band Mama San, these kids have real talent.
They're terrific.
- How about another blast of that sake?
- Okay.
Now I don't know where you came from 'Cause I don't know where you've been But it really doesn't matter Grab a chair and fill your platter And dig, dig, dig right in - Henry, how can we change your mind?
- You can't.
Now look, we came here to have a good time, so let's have it.
That's an order.
- - Try the octopus.
It's terrific.
I'll think I'll just stick with the seaweed sandwich.
Okay.
You speak.
Me speak.
"You speak"?
I'll get it.
Let me have that, Mama.
Hello there.
Colonel Blake speaking.
- Leslie!
- Right on time.
- How are you?
- I'm okay.
Except for missing a certain lieutenant colonel who shall be nameless.
- And you?
- Oh, fine, fine.
Uh, working very hard, of course.
Um, Henry, is Hawkeye with you?
He said he might be.
- Yeah, sure.
Pierce.
- Hmm?
- Leslie.
- For me?
- Yeah.
- Must be trouble.
- Yeah, what's happening?
- Hi.
Just a minute.
Hi.
This is the call you wanted, right, where I got one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel?
- Oh, yeah?
- I hope I don't have to come up with any fake symptoms.
- I got a weak stomach.
- The white count's up?
We had S.O.S. again for lunch.
- Yeah, you can't hold food down.
- You just missed the 4:00 barf.
Look, tell Spearchucker to get some blood chemistries and start him on I.V.'s.
We'll be right there.
Okay.
Get your shoes on.
We gotta go back.
- Got a tough case, Henry.
Diagnostic problem.
- Uh-huh.
Abdominal pain, elevated white count.
I can't nail it down.
- His white count's up?
- Yeah, it's bad.
That's all right.
Radar's strong.
- You dummy.
Can't you keep your mouth shut?
- Radar?
- Sorry, Hawk.
- Yeah, you're sorry now.
Wait a minute.
You talking about Radar?
I didn't wanna tell you.
I know how much he means to you.
You didn't wanna tell me what?
Well, about a week ago he developed symptoms- abdominal cramps, chills, high fever.
Listen, Henry, if it goes bad, could you write the letter?
You're about his only real friend in Korea.
You know, nothin' elaborate, keep it simple.
He comes from those kind of people.
- We'll give you a report as soon as we know something.
- Wait a minute!
You think I'm gonna sit around in a place like this and wait for that kid to cash in?
I was the best diagnostician in Bloomington.
We're gettin' out of here.
One of you call the airport.
Reserve a chopper.
Use my name.
Priority one.
I'll get my shoes.
Let's move!
Okay, we go P.X. now, big boy?
- Maybe later, Mama.
Sayonara.
- - The chopper's just landed.
- I know.
- Come on.
Lay down.
- Okay, okay.
You know what to do.
- You got to lay it on him now.
- Okay.
Lay down.
How's he doing?
Hi, fella.
Is that you, Mom?
It's your colonel, son.
Just relax.
Where do you hurt?
My gut.
- Well, let's have a look.
-  - Gonna get you well, Radar.
That hurt?
-  - That?
-  -  - Whatever he's got, it's spreading.
Colonel Blake, I just heard you were here, sir, and I- - What's that man doing in bed?
- He's sick.
Sick?
I saw him eat a quart of ice cream at lunch.
- I was so sick I didn't know what I was doing.
- That's okay, son.
-  - He's got to be goldbricking.
We've had a lot of that lately.
Now out of bed, back to the office and finish filling out those reports!
- Man's inhumanity to man again.
- Frank, I'm examining this patient.
Sorry, Henry.
Not until you sign a Transient Medic Form.
- Do me a favor.
Stuff it.
- I'll need your initials on a Visiting Physician.
Stuff that too.
Okay, prep this man for O.R. -  What?
- I'm gonna do an exploratory on him.
- Operate on him?
- "Operate on him"?
Henry, listen.
Let's do some studies- enzymes, abdominal X-rays, the works.
- Find out where we're going.
- I agree with Frank.
- I think we should test him.
- For a week or so, maybe longer.
This kid's got severe abdominal pain with rigidity.
It could be a perforated ulcer.
I'm going in.
Who wants to assist?
- I think you better slow down.
- I'll know the story five minutes after I open him up.
- He's gonna open me.
- You'll be fine, son.
- Now let's get on the stick.
- Look, Henry- I'm in command here, and nobody does an exploratory without my okay.
I'll explore anybody I want to.
You back off.
This happens to be my responsibility.
Stay out of my way, Frank, or I'll have you busted down to male nurse.
- Come on, fellas.
Be nice.
- This is my outfit.
I make the decisions.
Your outfit?
I built this outfit with my own hands.
When we first came over that hill, we didn't even have a bedpan.
There's not going to be any operation.
If you don't like it you can call Gen.
Hammond.
- I might just do that.
- Want me to get Gen.
Hammond for you, sir?
Yeah, do that!
See if UglyJohn's available.
If he isn't, pull him away from whatever he's doing and- Oh.
The pain.
Look at that.
He was goldbricking.
I told you so.
- Radar, are you sick?
- Well, I feel a lot better than I did.
- Now I don't feel so good.
- Let's get some air.
Hold it!
Nobody move!
Now what is going on here?
Pierce, Mclntyre,Jones, somebody talk to me.
Okay.
Attila the Hun was pushing us around playing soldiers.
So we tried to get you back in the front office.
By making Radar fake an illness?
Well, it was intended to make you feel needed.
It's all very psychiatric.
The word is "crazy.
" I'll get the M.P.'s.
Then you can try being psychiatric in the stockade.
Fine.
Then after we're gone, you can roller-skate from table to table and do all the surgery.
- He's right.
Put the phone down.
- As commanding officer, I- Correction.
You were the commanding officer.
I'm taking over as of now.
- Hey!
Welcome back, Henry.
- Henry!
I'll fix it with Gen.
Hammond.
- This is outrageous!
- Frank.
If I were you, I'd quit the army.
- Welcome home, Henry.
- What am I gonna do for massages around here?
- I'll be glad to walk all over you.
- I'm sure you will.
Okay.
Dealer has 20.
I'll pay 21.
- Pull up a chair, Henry.
- Ten-hut!
"Ten-hut" from Henry?
- You better knock it off, Hawkeye.
- Never heard him say that before.
You better get used to it.
I'm back in command now.
And you tow the line, all of you.
And no more horsing around.
Understood?
-  Yes, sir.
- Good.
Good.
Now you know where you stand.
Any questions?
- Yes, sir.
- What is it, man?
Speak up.
Can I buy you a drink, big boy san?
Look, I just got through- Well, maybe a little one.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
- One.
- One?
- One!
- Can you believe this guy?
He asks for one.
Will you just deal?
Ten dollars.
Man's luck is not to be believed.
- Nothing worse than a sore winner.
- Luck?
My openers.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
I win all the time because my heart is pure.
Right, Frank?
You're a vice-ridden degenerate.
I don't think you even have a heart.
Ooh!
Frank, for a doctor, that's a very serious diagnosis.
Now, now.
We all know how competent and dedicated Frank is.
That's why he and Hot Lips spend every night together in the examination room.
It so happens that Major Houlihan and I are studying the treatment of cardiac arrests.
I wouldn't mind making a cardiac arrest on Hot Lips.
Her name is Margaret.
- Ooh!
- $24.50, Ho-Jon.
What's the total?
Ah, $309.68, Hawkeye.
Keep those nickels and dimes coming, gang.
You keep that up and I'm gonna put your tongue in traction.
Why did you two ever become doctors?
- Why did you become a doctor, Major?
- To meet girls.
It was the wish of my dear mother, the guiding force of my life who- The frame.
- Her sterling silver frame!
- Take it easy, Frank.
You stole her frame, you guys!
You've done some terrible things before, but this is the worst!
You're fiends!
- Margaret, I- - Aaah!
- You look awful.
- Oh, Frank, what do you want?
My mother's silver frame is gone.
Well, I didn't take it.
I'm not accusing you, but it's gone!
You know how much my mother means to me.
Oh, Frank, it's only a frame.
It's the principle.
I feel violated.
My own mother's picture.
To think that those animals even laid their hands on it.
- Would you hand me my brushes?
- I don't think spanking them will do any good.
No, Frank, I'm gonna brush my hair.
One hundred strokes every night.
- It's getting late.
I might just stay for 50.
- Frank, my brushes?
- Where are they?
- On the night table, where I always keep them.
My brushes!
Where are they?
Where are my brushes?
- Margaret, control yourself.
- They're gone!
Somebody took them!
Margaret, they're only brushes.
No, they're not!
My father gave those to me!
- Leslie?
- Yes?
Oh, is it mine?
Oh, Henry!
That's the fish you caught last week.
Your very first.
And you had it stuffed just for me.
That's not all.
As a little token of my admiration, I sent to Tokyo for this.
Oh, Henry.
Oh, it's not- It certainly is.
A Sato Tanaka double-cammed reel with jeweled escarpment.
Oh!
Well, I can hardly wait to show the girls.
Open it.
Oh, yes.
Henry.
It's gone!
- I've got post-op duty, Captain.
- Not for 26 minutes, you don't.
I'll check my alarm watch.
Hmm.
Must have left it in the tent.
We'll make our own clock.
First, you put the big hand here, and then the little hand there.
You're running a little fast.
Hey!
What a day!
I sewed up enough people to make a crazy quilt!
Have you seen my watch?
It's Tuesday.
It's 1951.
What more do you have to know?
I'd like to find my watch.
Ho-Jon, the elixir of life.
Drinks for me and my men, and water for our horses.
Ah, where is it?
There it is.
Ahh.
Ah, the symphony begins.
The sultry saxophone splashes of melody.
A subtle drum brush for counterpoint.
The plunking of cool harp strings.
And now the silver vibes of the gentle swizzle stick.
And now, the silver vibes of the gentle swizzle stick.
Ho-Jon?
"Stizzle swick" not here.
Who stole my "stizzle swick"?
Everybody, will you keep it down?
We're trying to talk!
- Radar?
- Ten-hut!
Call everyone to attention.
At ease, men.
Everyone, be seated.
I assume you read my notice concerning our recent crime wave.
I would've read it, but the notice was stolen.
I'm talking about the rash of thefts that have plagued our camp.
- Our plague has a rash.
- That's the worst kind.
As it stated, in the interest of morale and unity- - Pass the salt.
- The- Yes, of course.
The guilty party need only return the stolen articles by 1900 hours tonight.
Well, it is now 1900 hours minus 30 seconds.
The lights will now be - turned off.
-  And the aforementioned guilty party may now return the things.
-  Trapper, stop that!
- Stop what?
I'm over here.
-  Ohh!
-  Oh, I'm sorry, Father.
That's all right, my child.
You couldn't have known.
Thank you.
-  You little devil.
-  What are you talking about?
- Frank, you little devil!
-  Oh, you're disgusting!
- Radar, is it 1900 hours?
- I can't see the clock.
Then turn on the- - Hey, my bag is gone!
- Mine too!
All right now.
Who took my spoon?
Somebody took my spoon!
I'm sorry to say this, folks, but you have left me no alternative but to conduct a tent-by-tent search which will start immediately and continue until I unearth the guilty party or parties, as the case or, uh, cases may be.
No one will be excluded from this grueling search.
I'm including myself, right down to my right hand, Corporal O'Reilly.
Naturally I regret any and all embarrassment this may cause to whomsoever it does.
But you, that is to say the guilty one of you, have left me no other way but to leave no stones or even shower unturned on.
At ease, men.
- Mclntyre?
- Yeah?
- What's in here?
- Soot, sir.
- Soot?
- Yeah.
I'll be the judge of that.
- Pierce?
- Yes?
Whose is this?
I'll give you three guesses.
Open it.
- Open it!
- Oh, Henry, don't be ridiculous.
If you want my opinion, this whole- This whole thing is not only a complete- a complete waste of time, it's also an insult to the intelligence of everybody- Why don't we have a drink?
Henry, this is crazy!
Actually, it's past crazy.
It's taken a left turn into ludicrous.
Look, if you will just tell me what the joke is, then we can let things get back to abnormal around here.
Joke?
You- I don't have that bizarre a sense of humor!
Oh!
Now, weren't you the one who sent General Barker the brownies with the laxative filling?
-The court-martial forms, Colonel.
-Court-martial?
Wait a minute.
What is this?
You trying to beat the four-minute frame?
Speaking of which, this goes right back around my mother.
That is Exhibit "A," Frank.
And you go into the stockade.
Yes siree, Bob!
- Right into the clink!
- You tell him, Frank.
- You know, I've never hit a woman.
- You put one hand on her- I was thinking of you, Frank.
- Okay, let's knock it off.
- Let me know when you all come to your senses.
Then we can find out who really took the stuff.
I'm going to my tent.
Knock three times and stay out.
Pierce?
- If you would just sign right here?
- Come on, Major.
- He was caught with the goods.
- At least that's the way General Barker understands it.
- You called Ge- - I called General Barker.
Excuse me.
I'll get my pen.
- Where is my pen?
- Pierce!
- He's done it again!
- Here's your pen, sir.
You left it on my desk.
- Thank you.
See what happens when you jump to conclusions?
I say he should be kept under constant surveillance.
- That's ridiculous.
- Why don't we get the General's opinion on that?
Hiya, Radar.
What's up?
Nothin' much.
What's- What're you up to?
I'm just lyin' around.
That's the way I feel too.
You mind if I just lie around with you?
Not if you use another bunk.
Why are you staring at me?
I'm not staring at you.
I'm just looking in your direction, that's all.
That's a very fine distinction.
Hi.
How's it goin'?
Any wealthy patients check in?
What are you doin' here, Radar?
Staring at me.
It's a new hobby.
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.
One scalpel.
And now, a special dedication to Captain Hawkeye Pierce: "Someone to Watch Over Me.
" - Looking for me, Hawkeye?
- Not really.
- Have a seat, my son.
- Uh, may I help you?
- I've been hoping you'd stop by.
- Good.
Don't be deceived by these trappings.
Underneath them, I'm just an ordinary man who is as prone to temptation as you are.
Would you like to talk about it, Father?
You're overwrought.
It's quite normal considering the burden you must be carrying.
Hmm.
In other words, you think I did it too.
I only know that given our circumstances, the best of us can behave in erratic and irresponsible ways.
As with everything else, it's all in here.
The dictionary?
Uh, hmm.
I did have a Bible here.
Thanks anyway, Father.
Hawkeye?
Attention!
Tonight's movie is Les Miserables rables, the riveting tale of a man who steals, and is relentlessly pursued.
Sort of like somebody we all know.
- Barbara!
Just the warm body I wanted to see.
- Whoops, the other one.
Let's go down to the river and practice mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
I don't think so.
Lieutenant, I've always admired your analytical mind.
You're one of the few people who can see things clearly without emotion or prejudice.
- Let me ask you- - I think you did it.
Let me rephrase the question.
How would you assess my general character?
You're cynical and selfish.
When you're not in the operating room, all you ever think about is your own pleasure.
Don't sugarcoat it.
Give it to me straight.
I'm very disappointed in you, Hawkeye.
Not surprised, but disappointed.
Come on, Radar.
Let's call it a night.
It's the end of the trail for you tomorrow, Radar, 'cause I'm putting an end to all of this foolishness.
I know how to find out who's behind all this, then it's everybody off my back.
Getting so a man can't talk to his own shrub around here.
Oh, come on, Henry.
What have you got to lose?
If we can catch the person that did this, you're liable to get a promotion.
- Or better yet, a transfer.
- A transfer?
Well, what do I have to do?
- This is just between the two of us.
- Yeah, yeah.
All right now, listen carefully!
Tomorrow morning the supply chopper is coming with the equipment for me to lift the fingerprints off the stolen articles.
Give me those articles for one hour and we'll have our thief.
- Pierce, that stuff is safely locked in my desk.
- What?
That stuff is safely locked in my desk, and that's where it's gonna stay.
- Okay, Henry, if that's the way you want it.
- That's the way I want it.
-  Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Why me?
Attention, the following report immediately to the mess tent.
Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake, Lieutenant Leslie Scorch, TrapperJohn Mclntyre, Major Frank Burns, Major Margaret Houlihan, Captain SpearchuckerJones, Lieutenant Barbara Bannerman, Corporal Radar O'Reilly.
What is it, an air raid?
What is the meaning of this?
Who called this meeting?
Look, I am the commanding officer, and I'm the only one authorized to call meetings.
Good evening.
Thank you all for coming.
I trust you will forgive me for disturbing you at this late hour, but the time has come to unmask the guilty party- the perpetrator of this bad practical joke.
We know who the guilty party is.
Why do you let him- Contain yourself, Dr. Burns.
Remember the old adage: "Methinks he doth protest too much.
" - Who does he think he is?
- The Thin Man?
You dislike me enough to wish me transferred to another base, preferably an enemy base.
But let us not forget Major Houlihan.
Tough, ambitious, yet greasy Major Houlihan.
Why think of only one culprit?
Why not a pair of sweethearts in crime?
You are sick!
Still another colleague resents me because of his consistent losses at the gaming tables.
- The man's a fruit cake!
- And yet you, Lieutenant, also had a motive of jealousy, because I share my affections among the ladies.
- You told me I was the only one!
- Ha!
Of course, my legendary prowess with the fairer sex was cause for envy on the part of Dr. Mclntyre!
Legendary?
I've seen you strike out in a geisha house.
Still, we must remember that the thefts were committed in several places, indicating that the thief had access to the various tents and was perhaps short enough to go unnoticed.
There is only one man here short enough to bathe in his own helmet, right, Radar?
Me?
I'm not short.
Let us not overlook the possibility of a mastermind who commands others to do his bidding, right, Henry?
Ah, sign what, Radar?
I'm sorry, Pierce.
It's going very well.
A most perplexing riddle, calling for the most ingenious of solutions.
Thus I made it publicly known that there were fingerprints to be found on the stolen articles, thereby tempting the criminal to repeat his crime and retrieve his ill-gotten booty, or his ill-booten gotty.
Which he has done!
However, in so doing, he has exposed himself.
Because I took the precaution of treating the stolen articles with hydrochloric-alpha-terracin.
What's hydrochloric-alpha-terracin?
A chemical which is at this moment coloring the culprit's fingernails blue.
Look no blue.
Yeah, I know, there couldn't be.
I was bluffing.
Why, Ho-Jon?
What did you need those things for?
For money.
To bring my mother and sister from our village up north.
To bribe the border guards.
I didn't think anyone would miss their bits and pieces.
You're all so rich.
And your footlocker was the safest place to hide things.
- Why didn't you just come and ask us?
- Yeah.
I didn't think you'd give me bribe money.
Bribery is dishonest.
Look, Ho-Jon, if it'll help at all, you can just keep the fishing reel.
I've got other brushes.
Oh, no.
You're all too good.
I can't take your things.
- You took them before.
- Okay.
- I really had to twist his arm.
- That's settled.
Now do you have enough stuff to bring your mother and sister here?
Oh, yes, because I have money too.
How much money can you have?
Three hundred and almost ten dollars.
Isn't that fantastic?
This kid only makes a couple of bucks a week, but he's been putting aside his nickels and pennies and stealing my poker winnings!
Oh, so I can bring my other sister and my baby brother- - Forget it, Hawkeye, there's too many of them.
- Bring 'em all, that's fine.
I'll make you a martini.
I'm not short.
I'm not.
I'm not short.
My mother was a little short.
That's fascinating.
- Oh, it is, it is.
- Yes, yes, very definitely.
It was after he returned to the garden that he discovered that three of his apostles were missing.
Don't look at me.
I didn't take 'em.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Happy days are here again  Attention, all MASH personnel.
Tonight's War Department film on how to lead a good, clean life has been canceled due to unusually heavy indifference.
Mm-hmm.
Another day of bed rest.
Oh, yes.
He's coming along splendidly.
I did this one myself.
- Quality shows, Frank.
- I like to think so.
All right.
Try not to move.
You've bought enough shrapnel in your backside to use it as a doorstop.
Let's watch our language, shall we, Mclntyre?
Frank, I'm sorry about that.
But you know how it is.
War is heck.
What do you got against writing intelligibly?
If I could have done that, I'd have become a lawyer.
Another day of bed rest.
Continue I.V.s. - How are you this morning, Pierce?
- Not too good but I'll feel better once I desert.
- This man's North Korean.
- Right, first time.
You'd better tell the M.P.s to have him transferred to the P.O.W. section.
Time, Frank.
Time.
I just got this kid out of shock.
He's got multiple lacerations.
You stick him in the clink, he's liable to kick off.
He doesn't look that bad to me.
Whatever he needs, he can get it at the next stop.
I'm sending him out.
Hold it, Doctor.
What this guy needs is some plasma and some rest.
He doesn't need a ticket for being on the wrong side.
We've got limited bed space.
You know that.
Why doesn't somebody tell them that up at the front?
They keep shooting each other like we've got beds for everybody.
- Get him out today.
- I don't think so.
- Don't make me get unpleasant.
- I can't improve on nature, Frank.
- He goes.
- He stays.
I'm sorry, but this time he happens to be right.
Look, I know the guy behaves like an enlistment poster but this time I got to back Frank up.
I want one day for that patient.
One day.
You want.
You know, Pierce, you've got a way of making every man in this outfit feel as if he's working for you.
Henry, open your middle drawer.
Look, this is not just another beef against Frank Burns, you know.
We can't turn that kid away.
Well, I mean, you're not asking much, are you?
I mean, you only want me to give him one unit of AB negative.
One lousy pint of blood.
Henry, I mean, who will ever miss it?
We're talking about AB negative.
Look, if I hand out AB neg to somebody from the other side and then one of our kids needs it General Hammond will personally give me a tail-ectomy without a local.
- Yes, sir?
- Radar!
Damn it, Radar!
How many times have I told you not to come in here before I call you?
I don't like to be late, sir.
How can you be late if you come in here before I even know I want you?
Ours is not to question why, sir.
- What, why?
What?
- You wanted these transfer orders, sir?
- No, I want the transfer orders.
- Yes, sir.
Those ones that you've got there in your hand.
Those are the ones.
- What orders are those?
- You're not transferring the Korean?
I've got no choice.
Now, honest.
We've only got so many beds, and this kid's got one waiting someplace else.
That'll be all, Rad- Give me 24 hours before you ship him out.
- No.
- One day.
As opposed to 24 hours.
Henry, you're turning into a regular-army clown before our very eyes.
Yeah.
All right.
Take all the time you want.
- You mean it?
-Just get him out of the post-op.
All right.
Where do we put him?
Anywhere.
But I don't want any more static from Frank Burns.
- That man is a raw nerve.
-  I couldn't agree more.
If I didn't know better, I'd say the guy was my wife in army drag.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Ask him if he's comfortable.
Look, ask him his name.
We just can't treat him like a wounded egg roll.
I wish He's called Pai.
Welcome to the end of the war, Pai.
Hawkeye?
Uh, here's the personal records you wanted.
This is the entire MASH personnel here and their blood type.
Terrific.
Take two splints out of petty cash.
Surprising how many of us have blood, isn't it?
Well, it's not so hard if you stay far enough behind the lines.
- But try to find someone with AB neg.
- Psst!
- Isn't that the P.O.W.?
- That's right.
He's in my C-O-T.
I ordered him shipped out.
What's he doing here?
Easy, Frank.
Henry okayed it.
He's not taking up anybody's space but mine.
Why don't you buzz off, Frank?
Go review your hypocritical oath.
Trap?
- Hmm?
- What do you think?
Hey.
Good work, Igor.
Very good.
In the morning he will be one of my brides.
Shh.
Not so loud, my count.
Margaret-  I think we struck dream.
Oh, Frank.
You're so strong.
- You're so big and strong.
-  We don't want to get him too excited.
We might start something we can't finish.
- You got enough?
- Almost.
- I want to put a head on it.
- This guy can sleep through anything.
But then, he gets a lot of practice while he's awake.
- How are you doing?
- Full.
One pint even.
Should we check his oil while we're at it?
You get him cleaned up.
I'll go get Pai ready.
Good night, darling.
You're the greatest.
- Did you get it?
- A full pint.
- Great.
Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's fine.
They may have to put starch in his underwear to sit up, but he's okay.
I see you ordered the hunt breakfast.
- "The hunt breakfast"?
What is that?
- Forget it.
Can I help it if the war gives me an appetite?
That's an awfully dirty look for so early in the day.
I just wanted to thank you for last night.
You weren't with me last night.
- I was speaking for my fantasies.
- You never quit, do you?
Well, in the absence of any real success with you in the amour department you have to allow me the odd fantasy or two.
You're having one right now, aren't you?
Yeah.
Is this a new one, or are you undressing me with your eyes again?
Well, if I did it with my hands, I'd get killed, right?
- Uh-huh.
- Not a bad way to go, really.
What do you say?
You got a minute?
Actually, I'm trying to make some time with this lieutenant person.
- He's got a minute.
- It's about Pai.
- I'll see you later.
- I'm sure you will.
Whether I'm there or not.
- What's wrong?
- You name it.
Severe abdominal pains nausea, darkened specimen, can't keep anything in his stomach.
- Transfusion reaction.
- Mm-hmm.
Last night's trip to Transylvania.
The same symptoms as hepatitis.
But it can't be from Frank's blood.
Not that fast.
Might be a new variant.
Stranger things have happened.
If Frank did have it it'd be a lovely way to get him out of our hair.
What about out of the outfit?
There he goes- Typhoid Mary.
- Loaded with jaundice juice.
-Let's go.
- Hey, Frank.
- Frank!
Frank, hold it up.
- Hey, how do you feel, pal?
- Feel?
Me?
- Yeah.
- What's the gag?
It's no gag.
We're interested in your health.
Oh, come on.
Frank, listen.
You, uh- Are you eating all right?
I mean, do you have any signs of fatigue or anything?
None.
Why are you- Well, my sleep was off a bit last night.
I had this weird dream.
Yeah, what was it?
That I was a soda with a big straw sticking in me.
You know something?
You could be coming down with something.
Guy works as hard as you.
Feel that.
Feel that.
- Huh?
Ooh, wow.
- You guys are starting something.
- Don't be paranoid.
- Everybody's against me.
Feverish, too, Doctor.
You know?
High pulse rate.
Yeah, a little disoriented.
Classic signs.
Oh, cut it out.
Hey, Frank, listen.
Why don't you give us a blood sample?
The lab down in Seoul can do a complete run on you and have the results back here in two hours.
I'm fine!
I'm completely fine!
The last thing I'm gonna give you two ghouls is any of my blood.
"Ghouls.
" That's a nice thing to call us vampires.
You know, we are gonna have to check him out- I mean, for his own good.
I don't think we can do another midnight caper.
Well, we got a little left over from last night's siphon.
Might be enough.
I think we're gonna have to get something else from Frank to back that up, don't you?
Definitely.
Frank, old buddy, let's hope you're not too housebroken.
Chossupnita, okay?
- Okay.
- Frank Burns at 6:00.
Oh, what do you say, Frank?
- Got a minute?
- I'm not giving you a blood sample.
I'm probably the fittest man in this outfit.
And don't ask me again how I feel, because you have no real concern for my welfare at all.
Take it easy, Frank.
There's a vein standing out on your head you could tow a car with.
- We just wanted your help, that's all.
- You wanted my help?
There's something wrong with the beer, and we can't figure out what it is.
You know all I know about beer is that I- I can't hold it.
I told you he'd be too hard-nosed to help.
Yeah, I thought for once he'd be a regular guy.
Well, let's see.
Okay, try this.
- Tastes all right to me.
- That's not enough to tell.
- It's fine.
- Okay, try this one.
- Aren't they the same?
- Close your eyes.
No monkey business.
Come on.
Now try this one.
- Remember what that tastes like - Mmm.
and try this one.
Now, which one was stronger, the first one or the second?
I'm not really sure.
Okay, let's try the first one again.
Now try the other one.
Well, what do you think?
I'll be right back.
Which beer do you think's flatter?
I-I don't know.
Just leave me alone, can't you?
You don't think the first was different from the second?
No.
Yes.
Whatever.
- Why are you two following me?
- No problem.
It's on our way.
- What's on your way?
- Wherever you're going.
That's the great kind of guys we are.
- Oh, morning, sir.
- What are you doing?
- Get this out of my way.
- I'm sorry, sir.
This is closed.
- Closed?
How can it be closed?
- We're redecorating.
What kind of nonsense is this?
We're just trying to brighten up our lives, sir.
We had complaints the latrines lacked any aesthetic quality whatsoever and it's essential we show the Koreans democratic plumbing in action.
Does the colonel know about this?
Of course he does, sir.
He signed the papers himself.
What are we supposed to do until the grand reopening?
Well, if you'll just step this way, sir we have temporary officers' arrangement right over here.
- This is it?
- Uh, there's more to it, sir.
- Ready, sir?
- Hang on.
-You got the full scam?
-I give the stuff to the lab in Seoul wait for the report, and get back here as fast as I can.
- Or it's- - My butt, sir.
Drive carefully.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, go.
- How long you figure?
- Two hours, tops.
We can't let him near any patients till we get that report.
Right.
No patients.
And no Hot Lips.
Observe the female of the species.
Seemingly calm and detached her tiny G.I. bosom is beating wildly because she senses the presence of her frequent partner the notorious red-necked nose-breather.
Uh-oh.
The signaling process has begun.
Eyeballs are exchanged and our khaki lovers do their famous "Where'll we meet today"?
ritual.
It is almost impossible for the uninitiated to discern any connection between these two U.S. Army majors.
Yet the trained observer will see that what these two offiicers have in mind is to arrange a bit of brass-rubbing.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me, sir?
Sir?
- Huh?
Huh?
The colonel says that he'd like to see you in his office immediately.
- The colonel?
- Yes, sir.
He's really upset about something and wants you there right away.
- Now?
- Yes, sir.
He said "immediately.
" It was imperative that you got there right away.
Oh, well- Ah!
I've been on fire all day.
Just the sight of you, and I want to do crazy things.
- Okay, where will we start?
- Oh, anywhere.
What are you doing here?
I'm taking a survey for the Peeping Toms of America.
You foul-minded, dirty, sneaking, spying- Not only that, but Dish wants you in post-op on the double.
Oh!
You haven't heard the last of this!
I bet I have.
Why-Why would I send for you, Frank?
I would assume that if you sent for me, you'd at least know why.
Well, I would too.
I mean, that certainly follows.
Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?
- Rad- Radar, Major Burns here says you said I said I wanted to see him.
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, did I want to see him?
- You must have, sir.
Here he is.
- Radar, are you trying to pull- - Why would I want to pull a fast one?
Would you stop saying what I am thinking?
One of us has to.
Sir, would you mind initialing these initials?
Why am I initialing these initials?
To authorize a stamp made with your initials, sir.
It'll save you having to do so much initialing.
- Ah-ha.
Good thinking.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Colonel am I dismissed?
Hmm?
Oh, yes.
Uh, I think we've, um just about covered it, Frank.
- Covered what?
- Whatever.
Come see us anytime, sir.
But I didn't send for you, Major.
Really.
Then why did Pierce say you needed my help?
Everything's under control.
That's when this place is the most dangerous.
Sorry I couldn't meet you.
I was sent on a wild-goose chase.
- So was I. - Margaret, what's happening?
They're jealous.
All of them,jealous of our fine almost spiritual relationship.
Oh, you're so right.
They want to keep us apart because we're symbols of- of what a decent man and woman can mean to each other without the tawdriness that fills their sordid little affairs.
- Yes, yes.
- Take one step closer and I'll bite your chest right through your shirt.
Where can we go?
I'll check the vegetable bins.
Frank, it's 4:30.
We have to go on hospital duty.
Eight whole hours before I can touch you?
There's always the coffee break.
It's 4:30.
Yeah.
All right.
Let's go.
- Boone should be back any minute.
- Any minute would be just fine.
- You got 'em?
- Yeah, I got 'em.
Hi, kids.
Should we make it a double date?
-Just watch your tongue.
- Can you say that in front of her?
Hey, Frank, we got a pretty light load in there today.
- Why don't you let us handle it?
- I carry my own weight.
We can't let you operate, Frank.
You look like an ad for death.
"You can't"?
The gall.
It's your liver, actually.
I think you'd better tell him.
We think you might have hepatitis, Frank.
What are you talking about?
We took a pint of blood out of you last night.
- You what?
- You took his what?
We drilled for blood, we gave it to the P.O.W and now he shows every sign of serum hepatitis.
It takes weeks for such symptoms to appear.
He probably came in here with it.
- Yeah, maybe, but who knows.
- Yeah.
My gown, Major.
- You're not going in there, Frank.
- Oh, yes, I am.
No, Frank.
You're a walking bug factory.
I'll deal with you two leeches after my shift.
- Sergeant, do your duty.
- Major.
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, get those off me, you maniac!
Quiet, please.
This is a hospital.
- Let me out of this!
- Enjoy it while you can.
Easy, Frank.
We'll have your report back in no time.
- Somebody!
- Report?
On my what?
- I don't think we should tell him.
- No, I don't think we should.
- I'll have you broken.
- Better be a good reason for this!
-I want these two arrested!
Immediately!
-You always want these two arrested.
Colonel, look at us!
Yeah, well, it looks a little silly- I mean, without the music.
Look, if you have a good explanation for this, I'll be a most attentive audience.
- Sir?
- Yes?
Oh, not you, sir.
This sir here, sir.
Here, sir.
Unlock him.
Lab report, Frank.
All tests for hepatitis, negative.
- You can't win 'em all.
- I told you so.
That P.O.W. came in here with it.
You stole a pint of my blood for nothing!
They what?
Maybe you'd know more about what was going on in this camp if you weren't so busy redecorating latrines!
Redecorating latrines?
- Radar, am I redecor- - Later, sir.
Okay, folks.
Visiting hours are over.
- Uh-oh.
Bad news, Frank.
- What?
- You've got anemia.
- Anemia?
What do you expect if you give a pint of blood when you're not ready for it?
Yeah, you should've checked with us first.
Yeah, you're too selfless, Frank.
- Very good.
- What do you say, men?
- Hiya, Frank.
Hi, Pai.
- Hi, guys.
How come the enemy talks to us and you don't?
You guys have a rough shift today?
Bad enough.
But we didn't forget our star patient.
No hard feelings, Frank?
- Well- - That's good, because there's a transplant we'd like to experiment with, and you're just the right type.
You-
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Mmm.
Dear Dad, a lull at last, after almost three straight days of meatball surgery.
Seventy hours of sewing kids together.
If this keeps up, I was thinking of asking the army for a raise.
Either that, or putting on some lipstick and earrings and getting a discharge.
If war was hell in Sherman's day, you can imagine what it is now.
- Retract that bowel so I can see something.
- Retractor.
Retractor.
- Go.
- Ease up, Frank.
- Well, hurry up, will ya?
- Clamp.
- Clamp.
The tension in the O.R. is always a foot thick, but we do our best to cut through.
Anybody hear how the game turned out?
- Yeah, the Bears beat the Packers 21 to 10.
- I'm trying to concentrate.
- Try the library.
Long fingers.
- Long fingers.
- Can't we have some military discipline in here?
- Good idea, Frank.
Lieutenant, throw out your chest.
Why?
It looks perfectly all right to me.
If jokes seem sacrilegious in an operating room, I promise you, they're a necessary defense against what we get down here at this end of the draft board.
Colonel Blake needs your help.
-Frank, pull that back for me, will ya?
-Okay, got it.
All right.
You ever thought of leaving your behind to science?
Henry Blake's a good doctor and a pretty good Joe.
As a commanding offiicer, well, it's a bit like being on a sinking liner, running to the bridge and finding out the captain is Daffy Duck.
But more about old Henry later.
Christmas here in Korea, as with you in Vermont, is soon upon us.
The glee club meets in the mess tent at 0800 hours.
The first number on tonight's schedule is Father Mulcahy's solo, "I'm Confessin' That I Love You.
"  Still, there is some effort to celebrate the idea of peace on earth, even though there's shootin' in them thar hills.
How far had Radar O'Reilly gotten in my last letter to you?
I think, if I'm not mistaken, he had mailed the backseats by then.
This week he's smuggling out the front seats.
It took Trapper and me a while to figure out what he was up to until we did a fluoroscope of one of his packages and found out he was mailing a jeep home, piece by piece.
- What's in the box?
- Toys for the orphans, sir.
- Oh.
Let me give you a hand.
- Would you, please, sir?
Radar's not the first guy to do this, of course.
It's an old army bit.
I wouldn't be surprised if one of George Washington's soldiers hadn't mailed home a horse one piece at a time.
Radar can't wait until he gets his discharge and tells his mailman back in Iowa that he actually delivered a whole jeep for him.
The guy'll probably have a retroactive hernia.
Come to the mess tent with me, Dad, and I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
Due to the number of people bored last Sunday, next Sunday will be canceled.
- Hi, Radar.
- Hi.
- It's lookin' good, Red.
- Wait till it's finished.
- 8:00 tonight, right?
- Make it 9:00.
- No sweat.
- I'll be ready.
That'll make two of us.
There are certain rules in this man's army that are carried over from the year one.
Thanks to these regulations, all of us know precisely what to do in case we're ever attacked by the French or the Indians.
One of the more ridiculous customs is the monthly lecture.
- Hey, hey!
- Whoo!
All right, people.
Let's settle down.
This month's topic is  marital sex and the family.
-  Louder, Henry.
- Uh, and the family.
- The first part.
- Marital se-  sex.
- Let's hear it for this month's topic!
- Yea!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Now,just hold it down, okay?
It's not actually necessary that any of you officers be present.
Only the enlisted personnel are required to attend.
- Why should they know more than we do?
- Yeah, I got a date tonight.
I want to learn as much as I can.
Let's just can the jokes.
I'd like to get right down to the sex.
I mean, uh, the talk about the, uh, what I'm supposed to talk about.
- Radar, would you uncover the charts?
- I'll uncover the charts, sir.
- Your pointer, sir.
- Thank you.
-  - Thank you.
- Good luck, sir.
- All right.
Um the, uh- We start here.
We've got your, uh, your man and your woman.
- Which is which?
- The one with the big hips is the man.
- Oh.
- Can we have an end to these comments?
Some of us happen to be genuinely interested in this subject.
I've devoted my life to this subject.
At least a good many of the nights.
Dirty mind.
Well, you know what they say.
Dirty mind, warm heart.
Uh, now- Uh, we, uh-  Excuse me.
Uh- The union of, uh, figure "A," man, and, uh, figure " B," uh, the, uh, woman  is the most sublime expression of romantic love.
However, only in the institution of marriage is it recommended that this expression take place.
-  Uh, sir?
- Mm-hmm?
What happens in the event that figure "A" is attracted to figure " B" and wants to get married, but figure "A" is already married to, say, figure "C," and figure "B"is engaged to figure "D"?
But figure "A" can't keep his hands off of figure " B," because she's got such a great figure.
Uh-huh.
Well, according to the army, he's got to forget her.
- That figures.
- Okay, moving right along now, we come to the matter of family reproduction.
How it really happens.
How it all really happens is, uh, really, uh, one of nature's really cute things, really.
Uh, first of all, it is necessary that these charts- that these two married charts- it is necessary that they, uh- uh- that they, uh- - They what, sir?
- that they, uh- - Dismissed.
-  Bravo!
Bravo!
Encore!
Hey!
Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake, ladies and gentlemen!
- 10:00 tonight?
- Make it 11:00.
Right.
Yo, Hawk!
The following men have volunteered for this afternoon's ten-mile physical fitness hike.
To bring you up to date on my copilot Trapper- As I wrote you earlier, he's developed a thriving, very lucrative private practice on the side over here.
On a good day, he collects about 50 or 60 smiles- the kind you never forget.
They're gettin' too hip.
That didn't hurt, did it?
Hey.
-  -  Whenever the locals want help, invariably it's "Trapper" John Mclntyre they turn to.
Whatever it is, it's urgent.
- Okay, okay.
You take care of the kids.
I'll be back.
- Okay.
Last week he performed a service that really set him up with the townies.
-  - He helped with a diffiicult delivery that added one more precious life to the village- a bouncing baby veal- for which service the doctor received one gallon of mother's milk.
Father Mulcahy is stringing popcorn all over the place in an attempt to give this cesspool a Yuletide look.
He's a terrifiic guy, our priest.
But I never tell him, 'cause I don't want to foul up his humility.
I can tell you this- I don't envy him this parish.
At least I didn't last Wednesday.
- Pierce.
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm here to relieve you.
- You do resemble an enema.
- You're beat, Captain.
I suggest you hit the sack this afternoon instead of chasing nurses.
That's a good idea, Frank, but some of those girls have been waiting for months.
Well, whatever you do, I want to see you shaved the next time I see you.
- I shaved this morning.
- Well, shave again, - and this time take one step closer to the razor.
- Aha.
Very good.
Frank, you are ten of the most boring people I know.
- Klinger.
- Sir?
- Where did you get that?
- Nurse McCarthy give it to me, sir.
- I'm talking about that bandana.
- Oh, that's my good luck.
My ma gimme this when I shipped out.
- Well, take it off.
- Oh, sir- - I want that bandana.
- I'll have my ma send you one.
Soldier, you're out of uniform.
Sir, the nurse said to get these right to the lab.
A nurse said?
You're placing me under a nurse?
- You said it, I didn't.
- Stop!
-  - You see what you did?
- Me?
What, are you crazy?
- Fellas, fellas- No, wait- No!
Hey, hey!
Go get him!
Fellas, now- Come on!
Break this up!
- Klinger!
Just before Chri- Oof!
- Aagh!
- What, are you crazy?
- Go on, scram.
Scram!
Get out of here!
- What's goin' on, Father?
- Shh-shh-shh!
- He's exhausted.
- Okay.
Where's the guy that exhausted him?
Let me take care of it.
Please?
- I'm not even Catholic.
- Would you like to be?
- Could I see you, Corporal Klinger?
- Not now, Father.
- I gotta see the major.
- Is that a grenade?
- That's what it is, Father.
- A live grenade?
I thought I'd stick it in the major's ear and find out.
Give it to me.
Don't touch me, or you're gonna be a lot of little priests.
Klinger- He broke the bottles.
The nurse wanted them in the lab.
I can't take this off!
Something'll happen to me!
- Klinger- - Stop.
- ## - Another step, and I'll take us both out.
He's tired.
We're all tired.
You tired too?
I can't get to sleep unless I count sacrificial sheep.
Give me the grenade.
Please?
Can I keep my bandana?
I guarantee it.
It's from my ma, you know.
She said, " Never take it off.
" - No reason why you should.
None at all.
- Heh!
- Sorry, guess I just- - Corporal Klinger, I understand-  Attention all personnel.
When filling out G.I. insurance forms, be sure to state your age and sex at the time of your last birthday.
Our nurses are a great bunch of girls- never a complaint, and they really work their lovely bottoms off.
Being so far from home at Christmas is kind of rough on them.
I've certainly done my share to keep up their morale, but I've only got two hands.
One lady in our outfit who has no problem at all with her spare time is our chief nurse, "Hot Lips"Houlihan.
The major is a paradox.
A woman of considerable passion, she is also a stickler for military correctness.
I wouldn't mind making a grab for her myself, but I don't know how to do that and salute her at the same time.
As I've written you, Frank Burns and Hot Lips have been an item over here ever since they both laid their beady little eyes on each other.
They think no one's wise, but the only one over here who doesn't know about their romance is General MacArthur's pipe stuffer.
Frank plays it very cool at all times.
He and Hot Lips had a date the other night, but it was the last thing Frank would admit.
Ah, going out tonight, Frank?
Just to stretch my legs.
What's that?
- It's French.
- Oh.
No wonder you smell like a snail.
Ha ha.
What neither Frank nor Hot Lips knows is that earlier in the afternoon, while they were off picking berries or whatever, Trapper and I stopped by her tent.
We spent a few minutes getting the place ready for their date that night.
It turned into some enchanted evening.
Three guesses.
- General MacArthur?
-  - Clark Gable?
- Ha ha ha!
- Ah Dr. Schwietzer?
- Right!
All three times.
- Frank.
- Margaret!
- Frank, don't make any marks.
- Uh-uh!
Frank, we've got hours.
That's right.
Let the others get theirs.
To go, Frank.
Hours to go.
Oh, of course.
Gee, it all looks so nice.
You've got golden hands, Margaret.
Mmm!
Oh!
Did you, uh, hear the rumor that peace talks might be starting?
Don't even think it.
Oh, Frank, the candle!
We may be throwing shadows.
Right.
Frank?
Somebody's been fooling with this.
It's a gag candle!
Oh, why can't people leave us alone?
Yeah, you'd think they were all my wife!
Oh, Frank!
Oh!
I-I'm sorry, Margaret.
I- F-Forget that I said that.
I did not say that.
- I didn't hear you say it!
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Mmm!
Oh!
Aah!
Aah!
Someone sawed through these legs!
There's pudding in the pillow.
- Oh, boy, I'm gonna get them for this!
-  I'll get 'em all, each and every dirty-  Oh, Frank!
Oh, I'll get them, I'll get them, I'll get them!
Oh, boy, I'll get them for this if it's the last- -  - Good night, Trapper.
Good night, Hawkeye.
A reminder that the 4077 th Christmas party for the Korean children in the area will be held today at 1400 hours.
So everyone turn out to meet the kids.
Santa will be there too.
We can only hope he's sober.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Excuse me, sirs.
Would you hold this, please?
Uh, Pierce?
Pierce?
Captain Pierce!
Pierce!
Are you crazy?
It was a Christmas present.
If you'd like, I can do it into a stocking.
Why you-you are a moral degenerate!
Me, a moral degenerate?
Santa Claus?
Ho ho ho ho ho ho!
Margaret, are-are you all right?
I'm fine, Frank, fine.
Well, the man's a beast, an animal.
Yeah, every bit of him.
What's the idea givin'Hot Lips mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?
I was getting a culture for the lab.
Any good?
I think if we could get her away from Frank, she could become a major kisser.
- That's what she's doing now.
- Oh, yeah.
How am I gonna get this thing off?
You realize if my father sees this, you'll have to marry me.
I wouldn't marry you for five dollars.
How's our house?
- Standing room only.
- Great.
Okay.
Help me with my bag, okay?
- I've gotta see you.
-  You'll have to get in line, little fella.
- Santa can't play favorites.
- Hold it!
Radar, where's that- - Here, sir.
- There's a squad pinned down on Hill 28.
They're caught in cross fire.
- The corporal's been hit bad and needs cutting pronto.
-  How do I get there?
- Chopper's waiting.
- Here you go, Santa.
- Wait a minute.
I'll go.
- No, it's a chest wound.
It'd better be Pierce.
There's an extra nurse on the bottom.
Save her for me.
- You betcha.
- Here you go.
Hey if I don't see you merry Christmas.
Tell me when you see me.
'Tis the day before Christmas, Dad, and I'd much rather be in the house.
Just too many creatures stirring around here for my comfort.
Frankly, the last thing I'd figured when I went to med school was winding up flying into battle dressed as Kris Kringle.
But then those kids down there are in the last place they ever figured.
Holy cow!
And you said there was no Santa Claus, huh?
P.S., Dad, I almost forgot to wish you a merry Christmas from everyone at MASH- "Trapper"Mclntyre Henry Blake even Frank Burns "Hot Lips"Houlihan future used-car dealer Radar O'Reilly Ginger Ballis Father Mulcahy Corporal Klinger all the ladies of the ensemble and of course, me, your loving son and unsuccessful draft dodger, Hawkeye.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
- Heading this way.
- Okay, everybody, this is it.
Ten seconds.
Nine, eight, Light it.
seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Zero!
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday!
-  - Happy birthday, Eddie.
Surprised?
Oh!
Wow!
We arranged that double ward duty just so you'd be kept busy.
We even hid all the bedpans just to make sure.
Blow out the candles.
Oh, I- I'm so sorry.
- It's no problem.
- Did you make a wish?
- Oh, yes, I- - No, don't tell us what it is, or it won't come true.
Uh, may I make a toast?
No.
But how about a farewell address?
Actually, I have a wish to propose- - a wish that very soon we'll all be united with our loved ones.
- Beautiful thought, Major.
Let's just hope nobody's wife or husband finds out about it.
Come on.
Get to the loot.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That one's ours.
- We're first.
We're first.
- The pink one.
"To Eddie.
Keep an eye on your brass.
Everyone else does.
" - Oh, oh, oh.
- Oh, thank you.
That's brass polish, so drink it slowly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Here, here.
Uh, please.
Allow me.
Thank you, Major.
The Ten Commandments!
Autographed?
"To Eddie.
For your own protection.
From the girls.
" - It's a bulletproof girdle.
-   Did you wanna say something, Henry, or are you just hoping for a free tonsillectomy?
As commanding officer, I believe it falls to me to say a few words.
- # For she's a jolly good fellow # - Little did I dream - # For she's a jolly good fellow # - when I was a medical student - # For she's a jolly good fellow # - that one day, - I would be in command- - #Which nobody can deny # Which nobody can deny - # For she's a jolly good fellow # - I'm- I'm sorry.
- # For she's a jolly good- # - I'm sorry!
- Eddie!
-  What's the matter?
I knew you shouldn't have made that speech, Henry.
I'm okay, Margie, really.
It's just that song.
" For She's AJolly Good Fellow.
" Well, I'm not jolly and I'm not a fellow.
Margie, I am 28 years old, and I have never had someone to care for me.
It takes time for the right guy to come along.
Oh, he's come and gone.
- He's very handsome.
- Mmm.
It's not a good picture.
Seymour Chomkey.
- Nice name.
- Oh, it's a terrible name, but " Mrs. " sounds so nice in front of it.
Well, it would have, that is.
We were engaged for almost two years.
And then Seymour was drafted.
I will never forgive North Korea for starting up.
I wrote to him every day, and he answered promptly once a month for the first month.
And then, nothing.
So I joined up too.
I thought maybe if I became a nurse, well, I might meet someone like Seymour, save his life, and he would be so grateful that- I'm getting shipped home in a couple of weeks, and no Seymour and no nobody else.
- You can't give up.
- Who wants me to give in?
Lieutenant, I've been very concerned about you lately.
You look down in the dumps.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I had the dumps as a child.
Now, based on my three classes in psychology, two of which I cut, I can tell you that your problem is all mental.
You think too much.
It's very bad.
You should forget about your mind and pay more attention to your body.
Or if you don't have the time, let me do it for you.
- I'm very concerned about Eddie.
- Me too.
Did you know you've got sexy knuckles?
I didn't think that was possible.
There are ten guys for every girl in this base.
You'd think there would be one for Eddie.
My dear, Eddie is a lovely girl, but she has a gift for calamity.
- She's a land mine in bloomers.
- Hawkeye!
Why don't we patent your ears?
We could sell a million of them!
I knew it was an alkaloid, but I forgot about its association with other amoebocytes.
- I've had the same problem.
- Uh, excuse me, sir.
- Can you help me please?
- What's wrong?
- I just got something in my eye.
- Dirt?
- A finger.
- How'd you get a finger in your eye?
- It came through the hole in the tent.
- What tent?
The one I had my eye up against.
I told you to stop peeking in the nurses' shower.
- Well, everyone needs a hobby.
- You're gonna be fine.
You put a heat compress on it, and you start lookin' in the mens' shower for a few days.
Don't you wanna know what I heard while I was peeking?
Frankly, I'd rather know what you saw while you were peeking.
Nurse Cutler's got 'em all organized.
She said unless someone gets very friendly with Nurse Eddie, things are going to get very cool around here.
- "Very cool"?
- And very lonely.
They wouldn't dare.
An attitude like that could destroy morale.
Weaken the fiber of our brave men in white.
These boys depend on their relaxation to renew and refresh their flagging spirits.
They must be allowed a moment's respite from the trials of war.
Mmm!
You smell divine.
I just washed my hair.
Listen, I've just given myself the rest of the day off.
Why don't we lock the door and study a few old medical journals?
- I have to wash my hair.
- You just did- What's going on, Leslie?
All week long, every time I've wanted to be alone with you, you have to wash your hair.
You're gonna wind up with a head that looks like a cue ball.
Excuse me.
The whole thing is inhuman, unfair and un-American.
Besides, it's bad for the health.
Could you pass the salt, please?
Edwina Ferguson.
The face that launched a thousand longer faces.
Henry, you're the commanding officer.
Command the girls to cut this out.
It's drivin' us nuts.
- Right, Hawk?
- Right.
You know, you've got awfully pretty legs, Henry.
Let's not get carried away, huh?
- I mean, we're not boys.
We're men.
- Thanks for the reminder.
And doctors, besides.
I mean, let's see a little fortitude, a little perseverance.
I've been hit by this thing too, you know, and you don't see me falling apart.
- Shower's ready, sir.
- Is it cold?
- Icy, sir.
- Excuse me.
Now, I don't have to tell you why we're all here tonight.
The time has come to end the siege.
Someone, at whatever risk to his life or limb, someone must make Lieutenant Edwina Ferguson his own.
May I say that I find this whole proposition highly- - Colonic?
- Irregular.
- I was close.
- And I refuse to be part of this unholy confluence.
Uh, Frank, I think I speak for everyone here when I say that if you don't lend your full cooperation to our little enterprise, you will be stripped naked, painted purple and dropped by helicopter behind enemy lines.
You wouldn't dare.
Radar, the straws, please.
Yo.
There comes a time in every soldier's life, from the lowliest private to the lowliest offiicer, when he must put his own well-being second to the greater good of his fellow fellows, his comrades in arms, his war buddies.
Let us each in his very own quiet heart say to that courageous man whoever he may turn out to be: "And there but for the fiickle pick of fate go I. And que sera, sera.
No hard feelings.
May the best man, uh, well, whatever.
" Shall we make it two out of three?
All right, now that we all know the procedure, let's go for keeps.
Congratulations, pal.
We really appreciate this.
- I need a drink.
- Double?
Yeah, about a size 11, triple-A.
Knock-knock.
Hope we're not interrupting anything.
Hey, what are they?
They're wearing our kind of uniforms, but they're not built like us.
They're all, uh, soft and bumpy.
You don't suppose they're, uh- - Girls?
- That's it!
I couldn't think of the word.
Now if I could only remember what they're for.
We just popped in to see what was happening.
I'm still hoping for a recount.
You?
Well, I want you women to know that I was fully opposed to this degenerate, depraved, immoral, perverted and indecent proposal.
But if it must occur- What do army regulations say about strangling a man with his own tongue?
- Get out of my way.
- Ah!
Don't worry, Frank.
I'd do the same thing for my own mother.
I almost envy Eddie.
It's too late for that now.
I'm spoken for.
Now we'll all get to see how the great lover operates.
- Retractor.
- Retractor.
- Give me some suction here.
- Suction.
Clamp.
Oh, they're forceps.
I'm-I'm sorry.
Perfectly all right.
I like forceps too.
In fact, I actually prefer them.
They're one of my favorite instruments.
May I join you?
Well, sure.
This job really makes me look forward to food.
- This is why this stuff is such a disappointment.
- Oh, it's not too bad.
Oh, you're too tolerant.
What I can't figure out is how they can make food taste like it's been drafted.
Here, let me, um, let me serve you.
Oh.
Thanks.
Well, what have we today?
Perhaps you'd like to start with some cream of leftover soup?
- No.
- Hmm?
Well, for an entree, you can have pork chops or our cook's award-winning beef stew.
- Pork chops.
- A very wise choice.
The award was presented by the North Koreans.
And you can have some vegetables or some gravy that won't hurt you if you don't swallow it.
- Huh?
- No gravy.
- Some coffee?
- Please.
You're very brave.
The coffee is made of gravy that didn't make it.
Where shall we sit?
You want to sit together?
I've tried sitting apart.
It's very painful.
Oh, thank you.
Margie tells me you'll be leaving us in a couple of weeks.
You're really lucky to be, uh, to be going home.
I have this- I have this recurring fantasy that I'll go home and my family will have left without any forwarding address.
You know, I could get 20 years for talking to myself.
Well, I'm just trying to figure out why you're sitting here.
You usually eat with Margie or one of the other girls.
- Well, you're one of the other girls.
- Why don't I believe you?
That's because you believe in the popular notion of me as a glib, insincere operator.
- That's right.
- Those are only some of my qualities.
Underneath, there's another me.
Shy, sensitive, uncertain- - Conniving.
- Right.
But underneath that, there's another me.
Underneath there, of course, there's public parking.
Nonetheless, I still don't understand - why you're sitting here.
- Because I find you an interesting person and I'd like to get to know you better in the short time we have left.
- You're not just saying that?
- On my Hippocratic Oath.
No, on second thought, make that my golfer's oath, which is more binding.
You know, I wonder what makes people attracted to each other?
Well, the first girl I really fell for was- it was just chemistry.
You mean, an electrical excitement?
Uh, no, no.
She wrote all my chemistry papers.
Without her, I wouldn't have gotten into med school.
- Disgusting.
- Vile.
- Meet you in back of the kitchen.
- Right behind the swill.
Hawkeye.
You're terrific.
- Oh, thanks, Coach.
- Really.
We appreciate it.
Yeah, well, I hope the Friends of Edwina Club appreciate the fact - that she and I are having a date tonight.
- Oh, great!
Great?
She just stepped on my ankle.
I have a run in my leg.
- You'll be fine.
- Mmm.
You wouldn't wanna give me one last kiss, would you, just in case she breaks my lips tonight?
Oh, I love the way you have your place fixed up.
Trapper took a correspondence course in interior decorating.
He failed it, of course.
Excuse me.
Japanese custom.
Fix you a martini?
Oh, I'm-I'm not a very good drinker.
Well, I'll give you a crash course.
I've never been in a man's tent before.
It's just like a woman's.
You just button it on the other side.
Thank you.
What shall we drink to?
- How about to dry clothes?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
No, not at all, not at all.
I-I don't mind a wet T-shirt.
Saves me the trouble of sweating.
- Eddie?
- It's all right, Hawkeye.
I mean, you're nice to try, but why don't we not pretend anymore, huh?
I mean, I heard people talking.
I can figure things out.
So why don't we just pretend we pretended, and-and everyone will be off the hook?
- Wait a second.
- Oh, don't worry.
- I'll tell everyone I had a wonderful time.
- Aah!
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
I- I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
It's okay.
Don't help me.
Aah!
Don't press the ice in my eye!
Look what I'm doing to a doctor!
It's all right.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Oh, let's drop it, Hawkeye.
Please?
Huh?
The game's over.
Okay.
Okay, it's over.
We're just two people waiting for a bus.
Or in my case, an ambulance.
Come here.
Sit down.
You don't have to hurt somebody just to make sure they don't hurt you first.
- Is-Is that what it is?
- I think so.
Dance with me?
Carefully?
-  -  I can't stand it!
I'm hopeless!
Cheap glass.
That's all.
Who cares about that?
That doesn't matter.
What matters is you.
- -  - Wh-What is it?
- I'm not wearing any shoes!
Your feet!
They must be cut to ribbons!
- Here, lie down.
- Wait!
Aah!
- I killed you.
- I don't have that kind of luck.
Just give me a minute.
Oh, I've- I've never seen anyone try so hard to be considerate.
Edwina, may I kiss you?
- Is your mouth insured?
- Shh.
That was nice.
- I didn't hurt anything?
- No.
- Oh, I will never forget this evening.
- Me neither.
- Oh, thank you, Hawkeye.
I- I'm so grateful.
- That's not necessary.
To know I can be myself with a man- To know I- Well, I don't have to beat him to the hurt.
Oh, wow!
Good-bye, Margie.
Thank you, Doctor.
- Good-bye, Edwina.
- Good-bye.
If civilian life gets boring, we're always here.
Why are you still smiling?
- No reason.
- Buy me a cup of coffee?
Sort of missed you chasing after me these past two weeks.
Well, a guy can find smoothness and grace and aptitude attractive for just so long, you know.
Oh.
This better?
Ow!
That's it.
Much better.
You're my kind of girl!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
- Hey, Radar, why don't you eat with us?
-  Okay.
That's a nice-looking hors d'oeuvre.
Would you like a doggie bag in advance?
Don't give him a doggie bag.
He eats those, too, with cream and sugar.
Hey, what's the matter, kid?
Come on.
You gotta stay in training for the Olympic Glutton Team.
I'll see you guys later.
- What about your lunch?
- I'm not eating.
- That's a first.
- Radar not eating.
- Not eating?
- We saw it with our own eyes.
- Aw, come on.
- Henry, we were there.
Yesterday I walked in here and found him on top of that filing cabinet in the fetal position.
- The fetal position?
- Dr. Freud, call your office, please.
And this morning, General Clayton called for the monthly report, and Radar told him, "We don't deliver.
" - Well, we don't.
- Not after 6:00.
- That's not the point.
- Colonel Blake.
- I'm in conference, Major.
- What I have to say is important.
I love shy, retiring women.
Colonel Blake, I requisitioned surgical silk for the O.R., and I was sent two boxes of ordinary cotton thread.
What are we supposed to do with that?
How about learning petit point?
The next time you see me, I want a salute, Captain.
Shall we make it in the women's shower, Major?
You'd better do something about the requisition foul-ups, Colonel.
Not your usual something, but something that means something.
I wonder how she'd like some plaster of paris in her shaving cream.
Cotton thread.
You know how long it's been since Radar's screwed up a requisition?
Henry, he's cracking up.
Or sick.
Or both.
Suppose we give him a complete physical, take him through a real workup.
Henry, that's a good idea.
Well, I sometimes get them.
Okay, muscles, step behind the screen.
Hey, you know, you're cute.
Just take the picture.
Dim the lights, Cutler.
Hawkeye, do you mind?
Keep your voice down.
You're disturbing the patient.
She's not bothering me.
Really, Hawkeye,you act like such a child at times!
- Is it high?
- High?
According to this, your blood should have whitecaps.
Come on.
Snap it up, will you, Radar?
Look, don't rush me.
It makes me nervous.
- Whistling doesn't help,you know!
- Come on!
Get on with it!
Get it right this time and I'll give you a lollipop.
Listen, everything is negative.
- You're in good shape.
- I told you I was all right.
If you were any healthier, you could be in the army.
- Yeah, it's not organic.
- Right.
Your body is 1-A, but your mind is 4-F.
I've seen these symptoms before.
It's called "goldbricking.
" My prescription is a little extra duty.
Frank, would you mind not being so true red, white and blue first thing in the morning?
Look, Radar, this examination only answers half the questions.
- Come on, tell us.
What's bugging you?
- It's nothing.
Yeah, is that why you walk around staring at your navel?
Although I don't know anybody else who would.
- It's nothing, I said!
- Now, listen to me, soldier.
We're all in this together with a common goal- to serve our country and repel the godless hoard from the north - that would engulf our way of life- - Frank.
He's okay, but you're making me sick.
"Godless hoard"?
Oh, nerts to you.
"Nerts"?
Come on, Radar, let us help you.
Tell us, what's turning you into a fruitcake?
Come on, kid, what is it?
Put it on the thing.
Hi there, Radar.
This is Linda Sue, coming to you from the glass booth of Holtzman's department store.
Everything is real good here, and being as how you and I are engaged, I think you should be the first to know I'm going to marry Elroy Fimple.
Now, please don't take it too hard, 'cause I know we're all gonna be real good friends if you come back alive.
- Just a minute, now.
-  Hiya, ol' buddy!
I'm sorry about what happened, but I guess you have to charge it up to old Mother Nature.
Well, you know how it is, and I sure hope you understand.
Good luck, and keep knocking off them Commies.
- Bye, now.
-  Good-bye, Radar.
I'll always have a soft place in my- Elroy!
-  - This is a glass booth.
- Elroy!
Quit kissing that part.
-  Elroy!
A DearJohn recording.
Listen, Radar, I know it's rough- This shouldn't be so hard.
What cures a man of a broken heart?
Heavy alimony?
- A date with Radar?
- Yeah, let him take you to the movies.
- He's a nice enough guy, but come on.
- How about tonight?
I can't.
I'm busy.
I've got a date.
Oh, I'm sure.
With whom?
You.
Who else can we think of?
Just a movie, O'Brien.
Or a walk over to the rec tent for a beer.
- Forget it.
- Try it once.
Look, I promise you he'll shave, and he won't wear his wool cap.
I'll even get him to clean his glasses.
I'm very fond of him, but I'm not going out with Corporal Radar O'Reilly, and that's that.
Would you hand me my towel, please?
Dry yourself with this.
Trapper!
And I hope your shower cap springs a leak.
He's bright, he's a good talker.
He's got a warm personality when you get to know him.
Radar?
Oh, come on.
Now, look.
Just try to imagine this.
You go for a walk in the moonlight down by the river, take along a blanket and a bottle of wine.
- Yeah?
- Hmm?
Sit in a secluded spot.
There's just the sound of the rippling water.
And then after that, it's just soft, moist, warm, passionate kisses.
Oh, yeah, Hawkeye.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, well, what about Radar?
Radar who?
What?
Well, thanks for the try, guys.
I really appreciate it.
It just happens everybody in camp was busy.
- Don't let it make you feel bad.
- Yeah.
You gotta understand, no woman's worth that kind of anguish.
No, look.
Let's face it.
I struck out in the World Series of love.
Radar,just suffer.
Don't try to write.
Lieutenant, you'll stay here.
Lieutenant, come with me.
- Corporal, get the lieutenants' bags.
- Uh, yes, sir.
Thanks.
That's sweet of you.
Uh, Corporal?
Your hand.
Oh, that's all right.
I am not using it now.
Did you see her, Hawkeye?
She's beautiful.
I know.
I heard the violins.
Actually, this is a very nice bottle of wine.
It's got a picture of a vineyard on the label just to show it was made out of grapes.
What a nice gesture, Captain.
Thank you very much.
It's for those bad days when the surgeons get restless.
Call me Hawkeye.
You're obviously in charge of making the replacements feel at home, right?
Oh, I just drive the welcome wagon.
I think you'll find we're a mighty friendly bunch of folks here in Cowardly Valley, missy ma'am.
"The Plays of George Bernard Shaw.
" "Plato's Republic.
" Oh, autographed by the author.
"The Complete Works of D'Annunzio.
" That's very interesting.
- Do you like Italian poets?
- No, but I'm crazy about lasagna.
I was wondering if you'd like to come over to the rec tent a little later -and meet our brave little gang.
- Oh, thanks.
I'll meet your brave little gang in time, I'm sure.
There's one guy in particular I know you'd enjoy meeting.
He's a brilliant conversationalist.
Got a provocative sense of humor, an inquiring mind.
I know you'll love him.
- I'm sure I would, but- - "Vivaldi"?
"Bach at Carnegie Hall"?
"Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich"?
You've got some great toe-tappers here.
- At least you got the names right.
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm a beer-barrel polka man myself.
-  "Well," he said.
How about later?
Pick you up around 8:00?
You know, Hawkeye, you're a very famous local character.
Who squealed?
And I am flattered.
But I'm also tired and a little leery.
Thanks for the bottle.
I had a nice time at your unpacking.
Hey, Radar, you got a problem.
Come here.
This Lieutenant Anderson has a brain.
Hawkeye, people with brains don't get transferred here.
Oh, yeah?
This kid brushes her teeth with an encyclopedia.
I borrowed these from Father Mulcahy for training purposes.
You've got a lot of work to do.
"War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy.
" War and peace?
Yeah, Tolstoy was very flexible.
He went either way.
You can't possibly read all of these.
Just familiarize yourself with the names and dates.
- You know what I mean?
Just fake it.
- Yeah.
"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"?
That sounds serious.
Well, it was no picnic.
"The crumbling Roman Empire was beset with strife.
" You just spoiled the movie for me.
What do I do if she corners me on something?
Okay, all right.
You look thoughtful and you say, "That's highly significant.
" - No.
- No, come on.
Try it.
Try it.
That's highly significant.
He said look thoughtful, not sick.
All right, okay.
Try this.
Try this.
"I consider that horse-and-buggy thinking.
" I consider that horse-and-buggy thinking.
- That's not bad.
- Hey.
Yeah, I like that.
You might have to get into a discussion about music with her.
- Music?
- She's got some pretty highbrow tastes.
Mozart?
Bach?
All the biggies?
Bach is easy.
If she brings him up, you just smile and you say, - "Ah, Bach.
" - Ah, Bach.
- Smile a little bit.
Smile.
- Ah, Bach.
That's nice.
Very good.
That's not bad.
If she throws the other guys at you, like Shostakovich- - Who?
- Shostakovich or Tchaikovsky.
You just try to look bored.
- That's your bored look?
- Yeah.
Go back to looking sick.
What do I do if she asks me what I like in music?
Well, say, uh, "Well, I'm partial to the fugue.
" Well, I'm partial to the fugue.
Can I say that to a girl I hardly know?
And I've been working at the headquarters hospital in Seoul.
- Very G.I. compared to this.
- Oh.
We run a very informal shop around here.
We don't work too hard.
Yeah, we try not to let the war spill over into the cocktail hour.
- Say something.
- Speaking ofTolstoy- Tolstoy?
What about him?
Radar was saying just the other day how flexible he is.
- Right, Radar?
Remember that?
Flexible.
- Yeah.
Flexible.
Uh, what Radar meant was that Tolstoy could either work at his writing or not work at his writing.
Actually, he was one of the hardest working neorealist writers of the 19th century.
I'll go along with that.
I'll tell you how I feel about Tolstoy.
That's highly significant.
I haven't said anything yet.
That's okay.
I have confidence in you, Lieutenant.
- Would you like some ketchup?
- It wouldn't hurt.
Thanks.
Real service.
I'm pretty good with mustard too.
We use a lot of ketchup around here.
It improves the food.
Well, when in Rome- The fall of the Roman Empire was due to internal strife.
Yeah, that's interesting.
It's from The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.
- Radar reads an awful lot.
- Big reader.
- As a matter of fact, he's voracious.
- Really?
Is that true?
Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.
Did you ever see anything like that?
Making a fuss over an enlisted man?
Fawning all over him?
It's almost obscene, that's what it is.
Probably only got one thing on her mind.
Don't say that word, Frank.
Not at lunch.
I was telling Radar about all those great records you have.
- Borrow them anytime you want to.
- Oh, thanks.
I've got Shostakovich, and I've got the London Symphony playing Tchaikovsky.
And of course, I never travel anywhere without good old Johann Sebastian.
Ah, Bach.
What does that mean, "Ah, Bach"?
Uh,just that.
Ah, Bach.
I think once you've said that, you've said it all.
- Ah, Bach.
- All right, hold it.
Somehow there's a mathematical precision about Bach, a complexity that adds up to actual simplicity.
It goes beyond emotion.
Um, I suppose non-lovers of Bach-  if there are any- would never really be able to understand it.
It's against regulations for enlisted personnel to consort with officers.
Major, has it occurred to you that these two people may be in love?
- That's not important.
- Not important?
Without love, what are we worth?
Eighty-nine cents.
Eighty-nine cents' worth of chemicals walking around lonely.
That means my marriage is only worth $1.78?
Colonel, Lieutenant Anderson is one of my nurses.
I'm responsible for her conduct.
Corporal O'Reilly is your responsibility.
I want this affair with him terminated!
"Affair"?
You're worried about Radar, a nearsighted, prepubescent corporal with six toes on each foot?
How many more physicals are you and Frank gonna exchange before you declare each other fit?
Are you going to enforce the regulations or try to lose it in the shuffle?
I'm warning you, break up this little romance, or you'll force me to make a formal complaint, over your head, to General Clayton.
One of these days I'm gonna booby trap her garter belt.
I wonder how she'd like it if I broke up her romance with Frank Burns.
- I wonder how she'd feel about that.
- Now, Pierce, I did not hear that.
I did not hear that.
And if it comes to that, I will deny any complicity with, or knowledge of, that sort of cheap, low, sneaky, underhanded maneuver.
Think you could do it?
You got it.
With a little butter and salt.
Wouldn't you like some if we sent out for some popcorn?
All right, folks.
We'll have our film now.
Maybe we could get a couple of hot dogs, like at a drive-in.
- For what?
- To watch the movies with.
Okay.
Folks, you want to, uh, kind of, uh, settle- - All right, people.
All right.
- - Quiet!
- Thank you, Radar.
Our film today deals with the newest methods of treating cardiogenic shock.
And along with that, we'll have some slides on the newest drugs available to us for the treatment of this disorder.
- Lights, please, Radar.
Thank you.
- - Hey, Frank.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Major, I just got word that you're needed right away in the postop.
- Oh, coming.
- Listen, this is right up your alley.
Well, yes, this is my specialty.
- But practice makes perfect.
- I've always said that.
Yeah.
All right.
This is slide "A, " followed, of course, by slide "C"?
"B.
"Slide "B.
" Sir, either stop that or I'll call the usher.
Oh!
It's been days and days and days and days, Frank.
- Shall we try for tonight?
- Mmm.
- My place or yours?
- Yours.
Last night they sewed me into my blanket.
Dr. Trueheart must have something going tonight, right, lover?
- Anybody we know?
- Anybody we missed?
Just because a man shaves doesn't have to mean he's- Yes, it does.
That's why shaving was invented, to kill time before a date.
It would never occur to people of your ilk that a man might just want to get rid of his beard and feel clean, would it?
Oh, you'd be clean with or without a beard, Frank.
You're the cleanest of the clean.
You're even cleaner.
You're so clean, you're dirty.
An officer should respect himself and the men he commands-  Oh, no.
Poor Frank.
Just can't hold his chloroform.
- - Come in, darling.
What do you want?
Major Burns' compliments, ma'am.
He's sorry, but he can't keep his date with you tonight.
"Date"?
What date?
I have no date with Major Burns.
We're just acquaintances.
Oh, we run into each other once in a while.
Well, he can't run into you tonight.
Where were you?
What happened last night?
You wouldn't believe it.
Those two maniacs?
They gave me a cologne overdose.
- What?
- I told you you wouldn't believe it.
Now?
You'd think they could run that postop ward for just one night without me.
I guess not.
- You're a very important man, ma'am.
- Well-  All right, Sergeant, what is it?
Wh-What's what?
What's what, Major?
I was told I was needed, and here I am.
- What for?
- That's what I'm asking you.
We've got no problems here, Major.
Except yours.
Well, then why- Margaret dear, it's me, Frank!
What are you doing?
- What are we doing?
-Just a little pillow talk.
But don't tell the house mother.
Oh, you guys!
I've had it!
I've had it with- Cones.
What are you doing in my bed?
The first one was too hard.
- And the second one was too soft.
- All right!
All right!
Now, what's it gonna take for you two to leave me alone?
Ease up on Radar and Louise Anderson, and cut out that G.I. garbage.
- Let them enjoy.
- No!
- It's blackmail.
- Okay.
- Nighty-night.
- Stop it!
Stop it!
We have a "stop it.
" Do I hear an "uncle"?
Uncle!
- No calls to General Clayton?
- No more calls to General Clayton.
- And you'll stay off Henry's back?
- I'll get off Henry's back.
- Fine.
And there's just one more thing.
- What?
- Who is this man in bed with me?
- Oh!
You don't know me.
I followed you home from the movies.
Out!
Of course, it was customary at that time for musicians to be subsidized by wealthy patrons.
There they are, America's kid sweethearts.
- And they owe it all to us.
- The Acme Cupid Company.
Considering the almost insurmountable odds against a struggling composer, his achievement, let alone his prodigious output, - becomes even more astounding.
- Hi there.
-  Hello.
- Hiya, Radar.
- Radar?
- Ah, Bach!
- - Tolstoy?
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Hey, Trapper, how much do you suppose this stuff's worth on the black market?
What would you do with your share?
Pay for my hernia operation.
All right, let me see- blankets, powdered milk, penicillin.
Okay, that's everything.
All right, Sister Theresa, all set.
Oh, how can I ever thank you, Hawkeye?
- And you, Trapper.
- No, don't thank us.
We're just acting on orders.
But whose?
Who's the author of all this generosity?
Uh, Tuttle.
Captain Tuttle.
That's who.
Right, Trap?
- Captain Tuttle?
- One of our finest officers.
- And a beautiful man.
-Just picture George Washington with John Wayne's agent.
I'll have the children at the orphanage write him a thank you letter tomorrow.
Oh, don't do that.
He doesn't like anybody to make a fuss.
No, no, uh-uh, that's right.
I mean, he's Mr. Humility.
- Captain Humility, actually.
- Captain Humility.
-Just tell the good captain I'll be praying for him.
Good-bye.
- Bye.
- Lovely lady.
- Yeah, but she could never be more than a sister to me.
Isn't she wasting her prayers on somebody who doesn't exist?
- Who doesn't exist?
- This, uh, Tuttle you made up.
Who says I made him up?
Don't con me.
He's a figment of your imagination.
And what makes you think you're not?
- Rough shift.
- Picnic.
Oh, not too many wounded, huh?
- No, no wounded.
I worked on a pregnant infantryman.
- Oh?
Nobody can figure out how it happened either.
He hasn't been near a woman in months.
Ahh, that's coffee.
- Hawkeye.
- Anybody coming in here telling me about more wounded is sucking around for a lobotomy.
Captain Tuttle's gotta sign this requisition form before Sister Theresa can get her next batch of supplies.
Listen, how did you come up with a name like "Tuttle" anyway?
- It was my imaginary childhood friend.
- You had an imaginary friend?
Yeah, if anybody said, "Who knocked over the garbage"?
I said, "Tuttle.
" They said, "Who broke that window"?
"Tuttle.
" - "Who wet the bed"?
- "Tuttle.
" He had no control at all.
- So when you got drafted- - He got drafted.
Just in case you wet your cot.
Precisely.
Hey, I had an imaginary friend when I was a little boy.
- Terrific.
- Her name was Shirley.
- Your imaginary friend was a girl?
- Mm-hmm.
- What'd she look like?
- Like me, - only with tiny little breasts.
- Out!
Out!
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Radar.
- Sign these, please.
- Right.
Whoa, those stockings came out nice, sir.
- Yeah, my wife sent me some new soap powder.
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, where do I- - Sign the original of each form, sir, and initial the carbon copies.
Or, if you want, you can sign the carbon copies and initial the originals.
And then sign this form signifying that you signed what you should've initialed.
Radar, do you really understand all this army stuff?
It helps not to be too bright, sir.
Uh, sir, would you sign the supplementary supply form, please?
It only needs a countersignature.
- Captain Tuttle's already okayed it.
- Fine.
Captain Tuttle?
Which one's Captain Tuttle?
Oh, you know, sir, that new man, Captain Tuttle.
-Did I meet him yesterday at breakfast?
-Yes.
Wait a minute.
I didn't have breakfast yesterday.
- Then you must've met him somewhere else, sir.
- Oh, right.
You put him in charge of supplementary supplies.
Oh, yeah, that's why he signed a supply form.
Tuttle- I knew I'd seen his name somewhere.
- If you'll just okay the duty roster.
- Yep.
- Major Burns is "Officer of the Day" again?
- He volunteered.
Frank always volunteers.
If we had a firing squad, he'd volunteer to be in charge of it or in front of it, or both.
Yes, sir.
- I knew you'd say that.
- Oh.
- Radar.
- Sir?
- Let's give Frank a little help winning the war.
- Sir?
- What about Captain Tuttle?
- What about him?
Well, has he ever pulled any O.D. duty?
- No, sir.
- Radar, if it's one thing I insist on, it's that every officer in my command pulls his fair share of the load.
No matter who he is.
Or isn't.
Attention: a change in the duty roster!
Tomorrow, Captain Jonathan S. Tuttle will be Officer of the Day.
- Frank, did you hear that?
- But I volunteered.
If you're free tomorrow night, I've got some new literature on pelvic deviation.
Margaret, I don't know any Captain Tuttle.
Do you?
Tuttle?
Well, he must be new.
Well, then, why didn't he report to me?
I'm second in command.
I'm sure Colonel Blake will get around to it once he finishes his laundry.
Yes, there is.
It's Tuttle's responsibility to present himself.
The man is obviously ignoring me.
Oh, Frank, why would he ignore you?
Guilt.
He can't face the man he's going to replace.
Who says he's going to replace you?
- Everyone here's against me, Margaret.
- Oh, only Pierce and Mclntyre.
Did I tell you they glued my Bible together?
Oh, Frank.
And they drew fangs on my picture of Senator McCarthy.
My poor darling.
Why don't we just check out this Captain Tuttle ourselves?
Margaret, you're my snug harbor.
I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have you to sail in to.
- Corporal.
- Sir?
- Where's the colonel?
- Colonel?
- Colonel Blake?
Uh, I'm afraid he's doing some very important sleeping for the army right now.
- Typical.
- I wanna see the personnel file on this new man, Captain Tuttle.
Sir, these files are locked.
You're gonna need authorization from Colonel Blake.
- Well, get it.
- Wake him.
Wake him?
He could be dreaming up some new medicine that could help all mankind.
Henry Blake?
That launderette?
Well, I'll get an authorization to see that Tuttle file.
Okay now, let's see, when was Tuttle born?
Um, how about 1924?
That was a good year for doctors.
Okay.
Mother?
Yes.
- Father?
- One.
Harry and Frieda Tuttle.
Birthplace?
Uh, hey, how about my hometown?
No, they've already got enough to be proud of.
How about- - Battle Creek, Michigan.
- Yeah, that's good.
That's perfect.
Yeah, good.
Okay.
Uh, religion?
Uh, atheist.
I don't believe in atheism.
- Let's make him a Druid.
- What's that?
- They worship trees.
- Ah, tree surgeon.
Druid, reformed.
They're allowed to pray at bushes.
Now what about medical school?
- Harvard.
- No, no, he can't be at anyplace they'll check.
Well, how about, um, Berlin Polytechnic?
Perfect.
- Berlinisches Polytechnikum.
-  - Oh?
- Right after he graduated from Adolf Hitler High.
- No, that's a bit much.
- You should write fiction.
You should read my file.
All right, now a little something for Hot Lips.
Height: six feet, four.
Weight: 195 pounds.
Hair: auburn.
Eyes: hazel.
- Hawkeye?
- Hmm?
I think I'm in love.
I'd certainly like to know why it's so all-fired important for you two to see the file on Captain Tuttle.
Because neither the major nor I remember having seen him, and that strikes us as very strange.
Well, I've seen him.
I had breakfast with the man only yesterday.
Here it is.
Tuttle,Jonathan, Captain.
Serial number 397-299-66.
"Berlinisches Polytechnikum.
" - Probably a Nazi.
-  Very impressive.
Well, if you two will excuse me, I told Tuttle I'd have lunch with him.
- So long, Radar.
- I'll hold down the fort.
Hold down the fort.
Auburn hair, hazel eyes.
Oh, for Pete's sake, Margaret, you're practically drooling.
Ah!
Frank, you're not jealous.
Not jealous.
If I lost you to anyone, I'd put a scalpel through my neck.
Frank, no, no, not here.
No one could see us or hear us.
Frank, no.
Do you know, there's still something spooky about this Tuttle?
Now I'll just call General Clayton and have him check it out.
- Sir?
- Corporal O'Reilly?
Get me General Clayton, headquarters in Seoul.
Yes, ma'am.
Just a minute, ma'am.
Psst.
Get me Captain Pierce over here right away.
H.Q. Seoul, this is Sergeant Pryor.
- Hi, Sparky, this is Radar.
- Hey, how you doin', boy?
Fine.
Hey, listen, Sparky.
I wanted to thank you for sending the Captain Marvel annual.
It just come today.
Okay, okay.
Look, listen.
I'm gonna be making a call on this line any second.
Patch it back to me.
Shazam.
- What's up, Radar?
- Major Houlihan is making a call to General Clayton.
- H.Q. Seoul on the phone, ma'am.
- Thank you.
Hello?
H.Q. Seoul, Sergeant Pryor.
General Clayton, please.
Major Margaret Houlihan.
- Hello?
- Hello, General?
Major Houlihan.
Margaret, I do hope this is going to be an obscene phone call.
I wish it could be, sir.
That is, I wonder if you might do me a favor.
You just say the word, Margaret, and I'll get a hormone shot.
Yes, sir.
What I want to know- Say, what did you think of that new man I sent down there- Tuttle?
You sent Captain Tuttle?
Yes, he's going to marry my niece.
Now try to keep him pure, Margaret, if you can keep your hot little hands off him.
Good-bye, Margaret.
- Hi, Frank.
- Hm.
- You want what, Frank?
- I want you to change my tent.
Make Captain Tuttle my roomie.
- Your roomie?
- Well, General Clayton asked that I personally look after him.
- Tuttle?
-Johnny.
- Isn't itJonathan?
- Well, not to his close friends.
Yeah, well,just leave it with me, Frank, and I'll see what I can do.
I can only tell you, Tuttle and I are both anxious for the change.
- We both speak the same language.
- Right.
Radar, there's something going on with Major Burns.
Yes, sir, with Major Houlihan.
I know one guy who got pictures.
No, I mean, with Captain Tuttle.
Major Burns and Captain Tuttle, sir?
If there's one thing I'm not gonna have in this outfit, Radar, it's politics.
I'm getting into this Tuttle business right now.
Attention, attention: CaptainJonathan Tuttle will report to Colonel Henry Blake on the double.
CaptainJonathan Tuttle, report at once.
Should we go back inside and build one?
- Where is he?
- I don't know, sir.
Well, I mean, it's not like Tuttle to keep me waiting.
- Is it?
- Last I saw him, he was in the compound, sir.
- Want me to go check?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll do it.
- Volunteering again, Frank?
- I don't want Tuttle to get in trouble with you, sir.
That's the least I can do for my buddy.
Buddies?
- Phillips?
- Here.
- Turner?
Tuttle?
- Yo!
- Captain Tuttle?
- No.
-Captain Pierce, M.D., manic depressive.
-Is that yours?
No, the only mail I'll accept is a full apology from President Truman.
That is addressed to Captain Tuttle.
Very good, Frank.
You read well enough to be a druggist.
- Where is he?
- Who, Tuttle?
In post-op.
I'm gonna drop this off.
- Oh, well, I can do that.
- Oh, that's very kind of you, Frank.
It certainly belies all the vicious gossip somebody is spreading about what a twisted, selfish, mean-spirited, overbearing fusspot you are.
- It certainly does.
- Then I'll stop spreading it.
You're not fit to be in the same camp with a man like Captain Tuttle!
- Mclntyre?
- Frank, if you're here to help, all the bedpans have already been emptied.
- Have you seen Tuttle?
- You just missed him.
He's over at X ray with Hot Lips.
He said something about doing some chest pictures.
You're a liar.
Excuse me, sir.
Well, don't let me interfere with your work.
I'll-I'll-I'll just put this package for you down and wait outside.
I-I know what you're doing must be very important, sir.
That is, if you are doing it.
Well, thank you very much.
Oh, Major!
- Margaret, have you seen him?
- Who?
- Tuttle.
- Pierce said he was with you.
Mclntyre said he was with you.
- Margaret, you haven't been seeing him secretly, have you?
- Shh, Frank, there are people.
If I find out you're seeing Tuttle, I'll put my head under a jeep.
Aj- Frank!
Frank, no one can take your place, no matter how attractive I find Captain Tuttle.
Just as I thought.
Tuttle hasn't been paid in 14 months.
- And he never said a word.
- What a guy.
Soldier, where do I find Captain Jonathan Tuttle?
Uh, he's in surgery right now, sir.
Now where is that?
I have a mess of back pay for him.
Uh, yes, he said I could take it and sign for it.
Corporal, when it involves this much money, I have to get his signature.
I'm sorry, Captain Tuttle, I had to have you sign to make sure that the signatures match.
You'd be surprised, the number of people that wanna stick it to Uncle Sam.
I hope the lack of pay was not an inconvenience to you.
No, no, fortunately, I'm independently wealthy.
My father invented bill padding.
Now you understand that all my future pay is to go directly to Sister Theresa's orphanage.
You are an inspiration to us all.
I know.
- Colonel?
- Hmm?
- It's for you.
General Clayton.
- General- Colonel Clayton, General Blake here, sir.
- Steady, Henry.
- Yes, sir.
I just called to offer my congratulations.
Well, that certainly means a lot coming from you, sir.
May I ask for what?
Well, I just got a letter from Sister Theresa.
- Oh, I didn't know you had a sister.
- She's a nun.
Oh, you must be very proud, sir.
Sister Theresa is a nun who runs an orphanage near your outfit.
Oh, well, I mean, I don't know every nun in the- It's not my habit, sir, to- That's not what I mean.
She told me that Captain Tuttle donated 14 months' pay to her orphanage.
Well, we're all mighty proud of Captain Tuttle.
I was just telling him that last night at dinner.
We've got to make our appreciation more tangible, Henry.
I mean, it's one thing to admire a man's work, but it's another to get your picture in the paper doing it.
Therefore, I've decided to come out on the field tomorrow and personally give Captain Tuttle a decoration.
- Wow!
- What's that?
I mean, wow, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Ra- Where is he?
Where is Tuttle?
Captain Pierce went to get him, sir.
- Radar, do I seem- - Scared to death.
Yes, sir.
Go hurry them up.
One day, he'll be coming to decorate you, Frank.
Well, it was easy for Tuttle.
He had all the breaks.
Oh, Frank, don't be bitter.
He's a fine American.
The finest.
Our country can use all the Tuttles we can get.
General Clayton.
How do you do, Sister?
We're proud of you.
Well- - Shall we get on with it, Henry?
- On with it.
Yes, General.
-Where's Tuttle?
-Oh, he's coming, sir.
He's quite busy.
- Busier than a brigadier general?
- Excuse me.
- Will you tell Radar to tell Pierce to tell Tuttle- - He's here, sir.
He's here, sir.
Uh, I mean- He's here, sir.
- General.
- Pierce, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid you're not gonna like this, sir.
Well, then, keep it to yourself, Pierce.
Tell us after we decorate Tuttle.
- There is no Tuttle.
- No Tuttle?
- No Tuttle?
-  Not anymore, sir.
That's all that's left.
Well, how'd it happen?
Well, you know Tuttle.
No sacrifice too great.
This morning, while the rest of us were selfishly having a cup of coffee, he went off in a helicopter to do some field surgery.
He jumped with his plasma, his bag, everything an army doctor needs.
Except his parachute.
- Oh, how awful.
- I'll see that he gets a personal citation for this.
I think that all of us who knew and loved Tuttle would like to pay tribute to this heroic man.
And I think it's only fitting that the man who knew him best, Captain Pierce, deliver the eulogy.
- That's not true.
I knew him best.
- Shh.
We can all be comforted by the thought that he's not really gone, that there's a little Tuttle left in all of us.
In fact, you might say that all of us together made up Tuttle.
I'll never forget him.
Our grief will pass.
It's already hard to remember exactly how Johnny looked, how he talked, his little laugh.
Thankfully he's left behind a memorial.
I've been informed by Radar that Captain Tuttle's G.I. insurance named Sister Theresa's orphanage as his sole benefiiciary.
How typical.
We salute you, Captain Tuttle, humanitarian and healer.
Good luck, Doctor, in that great big waiting room in the sky.
He was the best damn O.D. we ever had.
Nice work.
There wasn't a dry eye in the camp.
Tuttle always brought out the best in me.
Hey, I have a question.
Where'd you guys get the parachute and dog tags?
Uh, that was Major Murdock.
- Who?
- Who's Major Murdock?
You know, Murdock- tall, skinny guy.
Tuttle's replacement.
Oh, yeah, I had breakfast with him this morning.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Hey, Major.
Let me see that X ray, will you?
Yeah, right.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Come on, you little bugger.
Ah!
Got ya.
Thanks to my experience as pickup-sticks champion of southern Maine.
Now you can identify us to your lawyer.
Uh, can I have that bullet, Doc?
A souvenir.
I had a buy-back deal with the sniper, but all right.
Well, little thing like this is not gonna kick me off the line.
Frank, that's Colonel Buzz Brighton!
I saw his picture in Stars and Stripes.
- Ooh, a colonel.
- Yeah.
I didn't realize that we were carving on a full bird.
Instead of a local, we should have used something imported.
Ah, you save that stuff for the sick guys.
Listen, I'm not kiddin'.
When that local wears off, you're gonna feel something.
Why don't you come by the swamp later for some homemade painkiller?
- The swamp?
- Yeah, our tent.
- It's lovely.
-Just knock on the "condemned" sign and come in.
Careful, Major.
Somebody's liable to trip over your tongue.
Ooh!
Wow.
That's great gin.
- That's because it's aged.
- Been cooking since 8:00 this morning.
- Can I get you a refill?
- No, no, I'll get it.
Listen, Buzz, you better use this cane.
- You don't want to overwork that leg.
- I don't want to baby it either.
You don't think this is the first slug I've picked up, do you?
I noticed you got more stitches in your butt than a sampler.
All right, come on, fellas.
When can I get back to my men?
Couple of days.
You gotta take it easy.
Mental rest is important too.
Look, don't put me in the same league with the battle fatigue phonies.
That's just another way of yelling chicken, in my book.
I've heard of anxiety and overexposure to stress.
But I don't believe Freud ever mentioned "chicken.
" Do you, Doctor?
I believe once, in describing his mother's soup.
Look, all I wanna do is get back to my outfit.
This war is not gonna wait just because I'm sidetracked.
I'll bet it got slowed down a little though, didn't it?
Every time you get a wild hair and yell "charge," our surgery here's standing room only.
Ah, casualties are part of the game.
If it costs you a few good men to take a hill, that's the price you gotta pay.
Some real estate doesn't come cheap.
Well, to be honest, we're not too hot for your business.
Taking care of your outfit is a bit like making a house call at Custer's last stand.
You know, you guys are really civilians.
Right down to our yellow belly buttons.
Now, you got your whole life to perfect your trade.
I'm an army officer, and this war, you know, is not gonna last forever.
Well, no war is perfect.
The way I look at it is I only got a certain amount of time to knock off a couple of thousand gooks, turn a lot of boys into men and make a few points for myself.
With a little time left over to divide the Red Sea.
I'll leave that for the marines.
Ohh!
Well, thanks for the hooch.
I shall go out and get myself a little exercise here.
I'll see you.
Right.
What do you say we put him to sleep and put the bullet back in his leg?
Oh, he's a beauty.
- We got us a real ringbanger here.
- A what banger?
Didn't you see the way he kept banging his ring on the chair?
Yeah.
Little reminder that he's a quarterback in this war, we're just water boys.
I got a feeling he wouldn't be so tall if he weren't standing on so many bodies.
What do you say we try to keep Buzz around for a while?
I got the information you guys wanted.
You're a model of industry and sneakiness.
My friend at Walter Reed says that Brighton's physicals have been perfect.
Let me see that.
That's disgusting.
This guy is so fit, he'll be in good health two years after he's dead.
Look at this West Point info.
Guess what he broke.
- His back.
- His front.
The all-time record for never being on sick call.
Terrific.
And will you look at this?
The guy's racked up twice as many casualties as any other regimental commander while only gaining half the ground.
I think this guy oughta come out of the game for a little while.
Why don't we gift wrap a few dysentery germs for him?
- Is Colonel Blake in?
- Uh, no, sir.
He's in his tent, sir.
Good morning, Frank.
Wouldn't you like to know?
The problem is in Buzz's mind.
That's where we oughta strike.
Little homemade battle fatigue.
A karate chop to his reality.
What are you guys building?
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
- But, sir- - Oh!
Ouch!
Oh, my ear!
Is there any blood?
- For Pete's sake, sir.
You're a doctor.
- Listen, Frank.
I could paint a barn with someone else's blood.
I just can't stand to see my own.
I was right there in the operating room.
It was a simple excision of a bullet from his thigh.
No postop infection, no evidence of a fracture, no reason to still be here, except that maybe he's become a drinking buddy of Pierce and Mclntyre.
Last night, they filled a bucket with gin and were bobbing for olives.
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?
I'm just leaving to pick up those supplies in Seoul, Colonel.
Would you like to approve my requisition?
I certainly would.
- Excuse me, Frank.
- Of course.
Make sure the sardines are boneless and the peanut butter's chunky.
If they're out of cheese balls, get some smoked oysters.
Can I kiss your ear and make it better?
Not in front of, uh, EIJerkorino.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir!
Fine.
Carry on, Lieutenant.
Now then, Frank- About Colonel Brighton, sir, Pierce and Mclntyre might be deliberate-  Frank Burns is giving Henry a hard time about your patient, Colonel Brighton.
Oh, yeah?
Well, thanks, Leslie.
There'll be a little something under your pillow.
Me.
- If you're unhappy, examine Brighton.
- I can?
- How can I ever thank you, sir?
- Try leaving.
Yes, sir!
Will the owner of a red pickup truck, Illinois license LU6751, please fly back to Chicago and remove it from in front of the "Y".
- Buzz.
- Forty-nine, fifty.
I feel great.
- I was afraid of that.
- Absence of pain.
Could be an inflammation of the femur.
- That could cause parathesias.
- Or thrombophlebitis.
With an extension of the femoral vessels resulting in a pulmonary embolism.
- What?
- X rays don't lie, Buzz.
Buzz, look, we've been going over your whole history.
We think we should keep you around for a week for observation.
- No way.
- Buzz, look, it's the best thing to do.
No way.
They'll put someone else in charge of my outfit.
We've considered that possibility.
Look, do you mind if I get a second opinion, talk to Colonel Blake?
- Henry?
- Yeah.
That's a good idea.
He's terrific if you catch him early enough in the day.
What do you mean?
Well, he slips away once in a while and-  Oh, a boozer, huh?
You don't have to whisper.
Everybody knows.
- It's a tragedy really.
- Yeah, yeah.
See, Henry, uh, Henry could have been head surgeon at Walter Reed, but, um, he was swacked when he did an appendectomy on a general's wife.
It was a hell of a way to take out her adenoids.
What about, uh- what's-his-name?
- Burns.
He's a major.
- Yeah.
No offense, but you guys are just captains, aren't you?
- I get your point.
- Yeah.
Yeah, Frank is a terrific officer and a great doctor.
That's good enough for me.
That other thing doesn't matter at all.
No.
What other thing?
- Well, uh- - You don't think- - I don't think we should say.
- No, I don't- - I mean, he never actually got caught.
- That's right.
Doing what?
It's not Frank's fault he showed up in an air raid in high heels.
- Do you mean that he's a- - But a fine doctor.
And a great nurse.
A major?
- Drop by later for a drink?
- What?
Oh, yeah.
Colonel Brighton.
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Oh?
I wanna give you a checkup, see what we can do about getting you on your way.
Uh-huh.
Just let me get comfy here.
Whose are those?
Pierce and Mclntyre, they're always bringing nurses in here.
Degenerates.
You think that they're degenerates, huh?
It really makes no never mind.
Now I want to feel your leg.
It feels fine.
- What are you trying to do?
- Take your pulse.
Can't you do it without touching me?
- Well, Colonel, I- - Now, look, forget it.
Good afternoon, Colonel.
Your laundry, sir.
Thank you.
I- This stuff belongs to Colonel Blake.
A little small for him, don't you think?
They're not his.
No, they belong to a nurse friend of his.
Another one of those degenerates, right?
I didn't say that, Colonel.
I- Hey, what do you say, Buzz?
How's it going?
I just had a close call with that Burns character.
- Boy, you sure were right about him.
- I'm sorry.
- You've gotta get me out of here.
- We're doing the best we can.
What you don't understand is any time a body has been opened surgically, there's a shock to the system, kind of a head lag.
Although your thigh is fine, because you're not suffering any leg lag.
-How long do you figure?
Couple of days?
-Oh, tops.
- Until you're really yourself again.
- I am myself!
What are you talking about?
Buzz, uh, where are you going?
- I'm going to my tent.
- This is your tent.
No, this is my tent here.
I remember it because that's where the P.A. speaker- Was.
- You'll be okay.
- That Burns character really got to me.
See, Buzz, this is your sack, - and here is all your gear.
- Yeah, right.
Take it easy, Buzz, huh?
Yeah, why don't you lie down a while?
You know, rest.
Come on.
You got no place to go.
Relax.
Finish your milk.
What milk?
The milk you made such a fuss about getting this morning.
Oh.
See you later, Buzz.
Take a nice nap, okay?
Can we go to your tent, please?
I've got something I want you to see.
They all break in the end.
You'll, uh- You'll have to excuse how the place looks.
Yeah, the painters really left a mess.
I've just gone over Colonel Brighton's file.
X rays, the works.
He's 100 percent fit.
Why are you keeping him here?
Look, do you want us to ruin this guy's career?
Put down what's really wrong with him on his record?
- Is that what you want?
- What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?
Well, um, sometimes a little wound can trigger a bigger problem beneath the surface.
That's what I'm talking about.
Buzz Brighton has lost all confidence in himself, not just as an officer, as a man.
This morning there were tears on his pillow.
The bigger they are, you know.
More than once they found Patton sobbing inside his tank.
I never dreamed.
Everybody thinks he's a tower of strength.
But inside that colonel, there's a private who needs to be cuddled and held just like the rest of us.
Ah, nobody cares.
I want to thank you both for setting me straight.
Hey, Frank.
Want me to do your back?
No, thanks, Mr. Wisenheimer.
Hey, we got a poker game scheduled in the swamp tonight, but we'll try to be finished by the time you get back.
I know you like your beauty rest.
Oh, I'm not going anywhere tonight.
Thought you had a date with Hot Lips- uh, Major Houlihan.
- I do not.
- I saw her getting all spiffed up.
I thought you two were gonna tiptoe through the minefield.
- Spiffed up?
- Yeah, you know, hairdos, nail polish.
Never mind.
What the major does is her own business.
After all, her affairs are her own affairs.
Not that I mean to imply that she has any.
I don't go sticking my nose into her hairdos.
And you would do very well to keep your stories to yourself and mind your own beeswax!
Take it easy, Frank.
You're getting yourself into a lather.
-Margaret, who are you seeing and where?
-Frank, what's wrong?
It's him, isn't it?
Buzz.
You got one look at his thigh and went crazy.
Frank!
What- Just because someone is strong and muscular.
You're a pushover for powerfully built guys like us.
- It's nothing like that.
- Then why the new hairdo and  and-and the perfume?
Frank, don't sniff.
- Oh, Margaret.
- Frank.
You're dripping on my foot.
I was just in the shower- You can't just come in here dripping and sniffing.
Would you promise me that there's nothing between you and the colonel?
Nothing, and that's an order.
Oh, Margaret.
Oh, Frank.
You remember the chief nurse, Major Houlihan?
- Yeah, the blonde.
- She's gonna check you out.
It's very important.
After we sign your release, she has to sign you out.
- She's a good-lookin' gal.
- Oh!
You should see her in a sweater.
She'll melt your helmet line.
And passionate?
- Her lips are set at automatic pucker.
- That's very good.
Listen, this should be very interesting.
- She really simmers, our Hot Lips.
- You call her Hot Lips?
And not because she's left-handed.
- Thanks for clueing me in.
- Oh, there's only one thing.
She and Colonel Blake, uh- The boozer?
Hey, I'm glad you told me.
Uh, where you goin'?
I'm going to my, uh tent.
Are you absolutely certain I have to be checked out for small arms proficiency?
Yes, sir, it's something new.
Probably on account of the war.
- It's right here in these new orders.
- Oh, never mind.
It just seems funny they say do it at night.
Night fighting, sir.
There's a lot of it these days.
Yeah, but I'm a doctor.
I don't go running- It's necessary if you expect to collect your $325 pistol allowance.
Oh, for that kind of money, I guess I can take a shot in the dark.
-  - Oh, that's probably a joke.
Isn't it, sir?
- Anybody home?
- What's up, Pierce?
Henry, can I keep this bottle in your locker?
Nothing's safe in the swamp.
- Yeah, key's in the desk.
- Thank you.
You wouldn't like a shot, would you?
It's a little nippy out tonight.
Yes, sir, the temperature's dropped to almost 98.
Well, maybe a wee dram.
Here's looking up your old address.
- Oh.
- Colonel.
I'm Margaret Houlihan.
Uh, nice of you to drop by, Major.
I'm not here as an officer or as a nurse.
I'm here as a woman who sees you not only as a warrior, - but as a man.
- Oh.
Why, thank you.
A very exciting man.
Buzz, I want to help you.
Yeah, well, the only help I need, Major, would just get a release so I can get back to the front.
But we want to send you back confident and strong.
-I know you're worried about this thigh.
-Oh.
- You want it as strong as this one.
- Oh.
- Really, Major- - Margaret.
Major Margaret.
Now,just, uh- Nothing to worry about.
I'm not worried.
Just gonna sit here.
I wanna relax and be quiet.
- I know.
- And drink my milk.
Now, this is really the last one, Pierce, because I have got to shoot some targets and I didn't even know they were in season.
Easy.
Easy.
I'm only human.
- You don't have to be human with me.
-  Colonel Brighton?
It's Frank Burns.
Why can't he leave me alone?
- Colonel.
-  Don't say I'm here.
Don't say I'm here.
Colonel, are you alone?
- He can't keep his hands off of me.
- I know you're in there.
He what?
- Time for target practice.
- Let's go, Henry.
Gotta get out there.
Okay.
Don't move, Korea.
This is a stickup.
- See you down the road.
- Okay.
You're due on the range, sir.
Where the deer and the antelope play - #Where seldom is heard # - This way, sir.
- #A discouraging word ## - Yes, sir.
- After you, sir.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Margaret!
- Oh, Frank.
- Colonel Brighton!
- Buzz, be careful.
He's jealous.
Why should he be?
I don't belong to him.
You!
Ow!
Ow.
- What's going on here?
- Colonel, I'm sorry.
- I didn't know he was your girl.
- What?
I mean, I'm sorry.
I didn't know she was your girl.
- We wanted your advice on reenlisting.
- You're drunk!
Oh, that's a dirty lie, and I intend to press charges the minute I'm sober.
Look, Colonel, don't get in a beef just because of me.
- Get your hands off of me!
- Thank you, sir.
Keep your hands off of me Everybody, keep your hands off of me.
No examination!
I know how I am, and I know where I am.
I'm here.
I am here, and this is my tent because that is my milk.
Yes, sir.
- Henry.
- What?
Don't you think you better get out on the range?
Me too.
- Oh, Colonel- - Don't shoot!
Give him a chance, Henry.
He's half out of his head with battle fatigue.
- Right, Buzz?
- Right.
The ambulance is right outside, sir.
- Why don't we go outside to an ambulance?
- There's no more time.
Communication is very important.
You men, I'll see in the trenches.
What is the matter with him?
- Well, he just needs a little rest.
- Sign this, sir.
Am I signing?
- Yes, sir.
- Something good?
You're sending Buzz back to the States to cool off for a couple of months.
- He'll need a lot more than that.
- Oh, okay.
Now then, what about the old target practice?
- You got eight out of ten, sir.
- I did?
You just missed out on your $325 pistol allowance.
Oh, darn it.
-What say we go back to the swamp, hmm?
-Yeah, a little nightcap.
I would love to, fellas, but I'm on duty.
Carry on.
You're getting better.
Boy, I live for the day when you guys are out of my life.
Don't let them get to you, Major.
-Just trying to brighten things up.
- Brighten things up?
You're maniacs, you and your friend, both of you!
I don't know which one of you is sicker.
I'd like just the tip of it off and turned up a little at the end.
You know, the Dick Haynes look.
Oh, you!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Here we are.
-  - - Margaret.
- Frank.
Margaret, you don't know what it does to me being near you all day in surgery, only able to touch you through rubber gloves.
Dance?
-  - You all right?
Yes.
It's just this song.
It gives me goose bumps.
I'm the same way about "Pennsylvania Six-Five-Thousand.
" Oh, you're so light on your feet.
I was voted most graceful in my class at Veloz and Yolanda.
Oh.
Oh, Frank.
Frank, that's marvelous, but the blood is beginning to rush to my head.
It's not marvelous, Margaret, it's my back.
I can't move.
-  - Frank, don't moan!
But I have to!
When a man's in pain, he has to moan.
Shh!
No, not unless he wants to get caught in a lady's tent.
- I won't moan a word, but we've got to do something!
- Can you let go of me?
I'll try.
Oh!
Now, go get help.
But they'll see us dressed like this in my tent with a candle and "I'm in the Mood for Love.
" Margaret, I need help!
Oh, and you'll get help, my darling, but not in my tent!
I don't think I should be here, Hawkeye.
War's a dirty business, Lieutenant.
None of us should be here.
- I mean, in your tent.
- My tent's a dirty business too, but it's a lot more fun than the war.
Wait, no.
Have an olive for your martini.
Olive?
There aren't any olives in Korea.
There are at least a dozen right here in this jar.
From China.
Communist China?
I never talk politics with an olive.
- But they do come from up there.
- Mm-hmm.
- How?
- Well, let's just say I know a red on the black market who gets me green olives.
-  - Oh, that's terrible.
Those dumb Commies.
That's why they'll lose.
You can't conquer the world with a shoddy olive.
Hitler found that out.
Mmm, mmm!
Oh, this is sensational.
You're my kind of girl, Nancy.
Drunk.
Hawkeye!
- You a ventriloquist?
- Mm-mm.
It's your roomie.
I thought you were shooting craps with the chaplain.
- Frank- he's had an accident.
- Well, give him a mop and tell him to be more careful next time.
Come on, give me a hand, will ya?
I'm serious.
I hate him when he's serious.
I'll be right back.
- What's the matter, Frank?
- It's my- His back.
It's his back.
- How'd it happen?
- Well, I- He fell on his way to the shower.
He was coming from that direction.
From his tent, I guess.
Going in that direction.
The showers.
Were you directing traffic at the time of the accident, Officer?
Don't get snippy, Captain.
Frank, do you have a history with your back?
Oh, it goes out every few years.
Last time was V-J Day in Times Square when this big sailor hugged me.
Let's get him to the post-op ward and string him up.
Maybe traction would help.
Oh, traction helps.
Usually a day or two in traction- - Now, wait a minute, Frank, I'm the doctor here.
- I thought I was the doctor here.
- We're all doctors here.
The patient's a doctor here.
- Here, here.
Will you clowns act like professionals?
That man is hurt.
He's probably in shock.
He'll be in divorce court if you don't erase the tracks from your tent.
- Well, Frank, how goes it?
- He's resting comfortably, Colonel.
Thank you, Major.
Any pain, Frank?
Slight muscle spasms this morning, but readjusting the traction helped.
Thank you.
Radar, - Here, sir.
- give me the- - Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I wonder if we could discuss this, Frank.
It seems you've applied for the Purple Heart.
- Yes, Colonel, you see, the way we understand it- - Major!
Unless Frank's tongue's broken, I'd like to hear it from him.
- Frank.
- Well, yes, Colonel, I've, um, put in for the Purple Heart.
But according to your accident report, you tripped in the mud - on the way to the shower.
- Yes.
Is that the way you want it announced at the awards ceremony?
Tripped in the mud on the way to the shower?
- Well, well, I- - Sir, this injury was sustained at a front-line unit.
- Technically, that makes it battle-connected.
- On that basis, we'll be handing out medals for social diseases.
- What are you doing here, Pierce?
- I have a stethoscope fetish.
This is the only place I can wear one without attracting attention.
Henry, you're not going to endorse this idiot's application, are you?
That's major to you, Captain!
Henry, you're not going to endorse this major idiot's application, are you?
Pierce, that's a decision I'll decide when I decide - and make my, uh, decision and that will decide.
- Doc!
Doc!
- Now take it easy, kid, I'm a doctor.
-  But I need Dr. Pierce.
He's the only one who can help me.
- I'm Pierce.
What's the problem?
- You're my problem.
- I'm Pierce.
What's the problem?
- You're my problem.
I think I love you.
Tommy!
- You're a beautiful sight!
- What are you doing here?
What am I doin' here?
I'm an American soldier.
I'm one of the good guys.
Last I heard, I thought you had a foolproof way to beat the draft.
Well, the recruiting sergeant peeked under my dress, and here I am.
You-  Henry, I want you to meet one of my best friends, Tommy Gillis.
- Tommy, Henry Blake.
- Henry, you're a beautiful sight.
Well, how's it going, Tommy?
Then he writes a poem to his teacher called "Ode to a Pretty Teacher.
" He did.
Listen, how long have you two nuts known each other?
What time is it?
Right now, 15 years.
No, it's more than that.
It was- It was back in grammar school.
- It was fourth grade.
- Fifth grade.
Remember?
He was a wonderful child.
He was a bit of a sissy.
But he was one of the great milk monitors I've ever seen.
- Milk monitor?
- Well, that was a very responsible position.
It was the Depression, and anybody with milk carried a lot of weight.
- Oh?
-   Maxine.
What I don't understand is what a guy like you with your background is doing here?
Why aren't you a correspondent or something?
I'm keeping my country safe from the Communist menace.
- You used to be a Communist.
- I'm keeping my country safe from me.
- Oh, I'll drink to that.
- Look.
If I was a correspondent, I'd be reporting the war.
In the infantry, I'm living it.
- So what's the difference?
- Here.
Here's the difference.
You Never Hear the Bullet.
What?
Is that a book?
Yeah, it's about the war, and it's being written by a soldier, not a correspondent.
How can I explain it to you?
There's always that big blond kid in all the war movies.
Right?
The one that should never die and always does.
Yeah, and they bring him back to life in the next movie.
- That's a great way to run a war.
- Right.
Well, you always hear this big loud ricochet just before he gets killed.
Well, that's not the way it really happens.
There was a young blond kid in our outfit.
One day I looked over and half of him was gone.
You know what he said?
He said, "I never heard no bullet.
" That's why that book is called what it's called.
Let's get drunk.
- I'll drink to that.
- I never drink.
Captain Pierce, Captain Mclntyre, report to surgery!
- What was that?
- Him.
He hates it when we drink.
Listen, stick around for a while.
We'll be back in a bit.
Hey, you guys aren't gonna just prance off and leave me?
I live in a very small tent with three other guys.
Prance makes me nervous.
Listen, stick around, make yourself at home.
We'll be right back.
Thanks, but halftime's over.
I better get back to the war.
Oh, say good-bye to Henry for me.
He'll understand.
Tommy Gillis, you're a genuine lunatic.
Come back and see us soon.
Right.
We'll split a nurse.
So, dumbbell, when will I see you again, soon?
- That's up to the North Koreans.
- Tell 'em I sent you.
You still owe me for a pint of milk.
Multiple lacerations, contusions and abrasions.
Looks like somebody bit him.
I heard the North was using bamboo sticks, but biting?
Ah, the North didn't do it.
He did.
- What do you mean?
This guy bit that guy?
- Mm-hmm.
A fight.
This one has almost identical injuries, plus an ear that has to be sewn back on.
Well, that'll teach him to listen.
- Let me see that.
What were they fighting about?
- Nobody knows.
This one over here is an appendectomy.
- Oh, great, no battle-inflicted wounds.
-  All right, look, we can have time to do this and still be crocked before dinner.
Nancy, you prep the appendectomy, and we'll sew up Zale and Graziano.
- Father Mulcahy, are you all right?
-  Just out of breath.
I-I ran from chapel.
Happily you ran for nothing, Padre.
No last rites today.
Oh, thank heaven.
- Could I show you something in a get-well prayer?
-  That's good.
Okay, tie it off.
Got it?
Yeah, I got it, I got it.
Okay, lighten up on him.
Appendixes make me sick.
Sutures.
Did you see this kid's chest.
There's hardly a hair on it.
Maybe we got ourselves a flat-chested WAC.
Look how thin he is about the chest and waist.
Yeah.
"Private Wendell Petersen, Marine Corps.
" You know, I'd swear this kid is really a kid.
I guess if they're tall enough to reach the trigger, they're old enough to enlist.
- A question.
- The answer is yes.
We're not going to be interrupted again, are we?
My folks won't be home for hours.
Frank is in traction, and Trapper is watching a movie in the mess tent.
And you don't think that he might leave the movie?
And walk out on Deborah Paget?
Hurry-  Hurry, please, it's Major Burns.
- Tell him to get his own girl.
- He's in pain.
He wants to see you.
Remember where we were.
-  - T-Tell him where it hurts, Frank.
Don't be brave.
Why don't you go boil some water or something?
You know what your trouble is, you're a four-star hypochondriac.
- But the pain!
- The only pain around here is the one you two are giving me.
Please, I don't wanna go home.
Please.
Let me just stay here.
Don't reach for your appendix, kid, it's gone.
How do you feel?
All ready to go out and kill me some more gooks, sir.
Wendell, another word for gooks is people.
I mean, the North Koreans.
The Chinese, sir, the enemy.
I'm a marine.
We're the best.
I'm a coward.
We're the worst.
How long before I can get back to my outfit, sir?
Maybe a few more weeks.
Depends on how much post-operative pain you have.
I don't care about no pain.
I just wanna get back to the fightin'.
- How old are you, Wendell?
- Twenty.
Really, I'm 18.
For somebody who's both 20 and 18, you look awfully 16 to me.
See you later.
What'd you do while I was gone?
- I drank.
- Mm-hmm.
- And I filed my nails.
- Mm-hmm.
And I looked through this dirty book I found hidden on your shelf behind Arrowsmith.
Dirty book?
It's Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Oh, then how come one of the dwarves is named "Leather"?
Hawkeye!
Hot Lips, if you don't get out of here, I'll shoot you.
It's not Hot Lips, it's Radar.
Radar, if you don't get out of here, I'll shoot Hot Lips.
There's trouble in the post-op.
You gotta come.
- What is it, Frank again?
- No, no, it's a fight.
Hurry up.
I'll see ya.
Wait here, okay?
Be right back.
Watch it!
The back!
The back!
Watch the back!
Okay, break it up!
Break it up!
Cut it out!
Come on, come on.
Now what's all this about?
Come on.
What's going on?
- He stole my salami.
- You lousy liar.
Knock it off!
Knock it off!
Let me point out if you meatballs have ripped out those stitches I put in, I'm gonna put them back with staples.
- You got that?
- He stole my salami.
I smell it on his breath.
- All right, now wait a second.
- I- If I get you each a salami, will you promise to stop fighting at least until your stitches heal?
- Kosher?
- Kosher.
- Okay.
- All right.
Come here.
Radar!
Sir?
Take care of these guys.
If they give you any more trouble, I want you to beat them senseless with their own salamis.
Aye, aye, sir.
Wendell, as your doctor, I'd advise you to lay off hot-wiring jeeps for a few days.
- You're not sendin' me home.
- For an appendix?
If they sent you home for that, I'd take my own out every other day.
Come on.
Crummy appendix.
If it hadn't been for that, I'd still be up there with my outfit.
Maybe I'd even get me that medal and show that dumb Bernice.
- Bernice?
That your sergeant?
- That's my girl.
She was anyway.
We was goin' steady, and then she dumps me 'cause Augie Hofstetter comes back from boot camp.
Well, it ain't my fault I'm too young to join up.
- You 16?
- Almost.
-Did you use a phony birth certificate?
-My brother's.
- What about your folks?
- They think I run off to join the circus.
Send 'em a couple of postcards with elephants on it.
They don't know the difference.
But you see if I was a hero with a medal and everything, I just know Bernice'd beg me to come back.
-  Look, Wendell- - Walter.
- Wendell's my brother's name.
- Right.
I was just wondering if any girl worth having cares whether you have a medal or not.
And it's none of my business.
If you wanna dress up like a soldier and play marine, that's up to you.
Just come inside and let yourself heal for a few days.
And I won't turn you in.
Okay?
Gee, Captain, for an army guy, you're okay.
Who's in the army?
I just wear this uniform because my saddle shoes clash with blood.
- She's not in there anymore.
- What are you talking about?
-Attention, attention: All medical personnel- - That's what I'm talking about.
- Oh!
- The whole regiment took it in the teeth a while ago.
It's gonna be a long night.
Come on.
Give me some suction.
I can't see anything.
-  - There, good.
How many does this make?
Ask Colonel Blake.
He's the one who puts notches in his scalpel.
Dr. Pierce, this one's very shocky.
- Trapper, can you finish for me?
- Go ahead.
Yeah, okay.
Pierce, I heard that little remark.
Good.
We won't have to amputate your ears, Henry.
I'd give you a kiss, but I can't lift my head.
You'd just get my mask icky.
He's had ten milligrams of morphine.
Pressure, 80 over 50, and faint.
Give me some O-negative blood here, quick!
Blood's for me.
I'm anemic.
Henry, I need your help.
Start another I.V. with a large bore needle.
- Come on, get over there and help me.
- Seventy over fifty.
Wanna hear a funny one?
I heard the bullet coming just like in the movies.
So you'll change the title of the book, that's all.
Sometimes You Hear the Bullet.
It's a better title anyway.
Sixty.
They got the aorta.
Give me some retraction and suction.
- Father Mulcahy.
- I can't get a pressure.
- We've lost the pulse.
- I'm gonna open the chest.
Give me a knife.
- I said, give me a knife!
- Pierce.
Go help Mclntyre.
Go help Mclntyre.
Come on, move.
We're jammed up in here.
Pierce, is there anything I can do to help?
This is the first time I cried since I came to this crummy place.
I don't understand that.
Well, Gillis was your friend.
I mean, it's only natural that you'd, you know- I know why I'm crying now.
Tommy was my friend, and I watched him die, and I'm crying.
I've watched guys die almost every day.
Why didn't I ever cry for them?
Because you're a doctor.
What the hell does that mean?
I don't know.
If I had the answer, I'd be at the Mayo Clinic.
Does this place look like the Mayo Clinic?
Look, all I know is what they taught me at command school.
There are certain rules about a war, and rule number one is: Young men die.
Rule number two is: Doctors can't change rule number one.
You believe that?
I don't know.
Do you?
I don't know, but I know one doctor who can keep one young man from dying in one war.
Major Houlihan, this is Private Wendell Petersen, United States Marines, except Wendell's name is really Walter, and he's only 15 years old, and he's going back home where he belongs.
Put a guard on him.
Give him to the M.P.'s as soon as he's well enough to travel.
You double-crosser.
I'm never gonna forgive you for this!
Not for the rest of my life!
Let's hope it's a long and healthy hate.
"And because said injuries were sustained at a MASH unit in a zone of armed combat, "the Secretary of the Army hereby declares - "that Franklin D. Burns, Major, U.S. Army Reserves, - Sir?
shall be awarded the Order of the Purple Heart.
" - Sir?
- May I have the medal, please?
Frank, here is your purple earring.
Earring?
I guess you didn't know having your appendix out at a line unit - qualified you for the Purple Heart?
- No, I sure didn't.
- Gee, you really got it for me fast, Hawkeye.
- Well, there are ways.
- Give my love to Bernice.
- I will.
- Have a good trip, Wendell.
- Walter.
Both of you.
- Out of the way there.
Move!
- Aren't we grumpy today?
Well, what do you expect?
Somebody's stolen Frank's medal.
It's not everybody who wins a purple earring.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
" Dear Dad.
Sorry I haven't written sooner but you know how the work piles up around here.
Korea's pretty much the same story: The fighting goes on- the hatred, the violence the senseless brutality, men behaving like animals then, of course, there's the war.
Business unfortunately remains very brisk.
- I think you know by now I'm not being flip -  but, doing meatball surgery, you either develop a thick skin or you wind up in the Tokyo Giggling Academy.
" Oh, wow, what a mess.
Stomach, kidney, liver.
What is this- an organ recital?
Keep it down.
I'm doing something very difficult here.
Trying to tie your shoe again, Frank?
Colonel Blake, could we have some measure of military discipline?
Good idea.
Everybody up for calisthenics.
Care to join me for some push-ups, Hot Lips?
-  Oh, really!
- Knock it off!
.
"Luckily we've got an extra pair of hands these days- - Captain Adam Casey.
-  He's really a fine surgeon, every bit as good as I am- and I'll get him for it.
" Wanna give me a hand with these intestines?
They're shot to pieces.
Give me a retractor.
"The work may be hard and ugly, but we can always count on - the North Koreans to hand us a couple of laughs.
" -   - Oh, what is that?
-  They got the generator.
We need some lights in here.
All right, nobody panic.
Let's keep cool.
-  Who's panicking?
- You're panicking, Frank!
- I can't see anything.
But it's dark.
- So?
Shove any patients you can't finish under a table.
They'll be safe there.
How the hell did you get in the army, Frank?
- Three-0 silk.
- Three-0 silk.
- Suture scissors.
- Suture scissors.
"Snoo.
" "Snoo"?
What's "snoo"?
Nothin' much.
What's "snoo" with you?
- Can't you ever be serious?
- I tried it once.
Everybody laughed.
"And so it goes.
Here comes Corporal Klinger, one of our orderlies.
A nice guy whose only purpose in life is to get out of the army- a purpose shared by three or four million of us - only Klinger- he'll stop at nothing.
" -  Come in.
Captain, I have the X rays you wanted to look over.
Thank you.
Uh, Klinger do you mind a little constructive criticism?
- No, sir.
- First of all, it's gorgeous.
It's easy to go overboard with one of those things, but that's tasteful without being gaudy.
- Thank you, sir.
-Just one suggestion: You must wear a slip.
With the sun behind you, I can see clear through to your shorts.
Of course!
And I've got so many slips in my tent.
- Thanks for the X rays.
- Yes, sir.
- May I ask where you got that?
- Mail-order catalog, sir.
A white wedding gown?
I'm entitled.
I'm a virgin.
"I guess the sanest guy in the outfit is Father Mulcahy.
It's a wonder he doesn't go deaf from the sound of all the commandments breaking here.
"  Father, is everything all right?
- It's my back.
- Did you throw it out?
No, but I'd sure like to.
- Let's go in the tent.
I'll take a look at it.
- Thanks.
Thanks, Captain Casey.
Do you have a history of back trouble?
Yeah.
Started in Jesuit school- all that kneeling.
You stay with your back toward me, Father and just relax.
-  -  Now how's that feel?
Better!
My back really feels better.
Good, good.
Now, you just try and take it easy for a few days and stay off your knees.
Thank you very much, Doctor.
- Father?
- Yes?
It's all right.
Oh, Doctor, one good turn deserves another.
Father can we consider this a confessional?
I am a priest.
I'm not a doctor.
"I don't want you to think this is a madhouse, Dad.
We're nowhere near that organized.
What we are mainly is bored- bored right out of our skulls.
" - Nothing fazes anybody around here!
- What's the matter with you?
- Everybody's a cipher.
An army of walking zilches.
- All of a sudden- I could walk around this compound- I could walk into that mess tent order lunch stark naked, nobody would pay any attention to me.
- Are you crazy?
- I bet you 50 bucks.
- A little drink before lunch?
- Don't mind if I do.
One for the road, as it were.
I have always relied upon the kindness of strangers.
We don't usually serve people without neckties.
- Shall we?
- After you.
-  -  - Fifty bucks.
- I left my pockets back in the Swamp.
Now that's tasteful without being gaudy.
"It's very quiet at the moment, Dad.
The only man in sight is Radar O'Reilly, a amazing kid.
I've never put much stock in E.S.P but if it is possible for one person to read another person's mind Radar has that ability, the little fink.
" Is that a nice thing to say?
"I don't know what Henry Blake would do without Radar and I don't know what we'd do without Henry but I can't wait to get home and find out.
" - Uh, sir?
- Yes, Radar?
- Are you busy?
- No, no, no, no.
- Sign these please, sir.
- Righty-o.
Oh, for- - My dad's pen.
- Oh.
What's this, Radar?
- That's personal, sir.
- Well, you can tell me.
My name's on it.
Well, I'm taking this correspondence course from the Triple-A High School Diploma Company of Dellavin, Indiana.
- The Triple-A- - High School Diploma Company of Dellavin, Indiana.
- I see.
- Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.
Well, uh, it's final week- And you want me to take you to the senior prom, right?
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
That says that I passed my final exam.
How do I know you passed your final exam?
You must, sir.
You signed it.
Easy, Radar.
Now you know me.
I'll sign anything army- I mean, I'll sign the surrender papers- but I've got a reputation and a civilian practice to think about and the last thing I need in this world is trouble from the Triple-A High School Diploma Company of Dellavin, Indiana.
I'm sorry, sir.
You know, if you want, you could give me the test.
I just didn't wanna take up your time.
That's no problem.
I mean, the war's pretty slow right now.
Where's the test?
It's right here, sir, in this officially sealed envelope.
- The seal's broken.
- Oh?
That must have been the censor.
They're always on the lookout for a dirty question.
Well, let's see here.
All right, Radar, take a piece of paper and a pencil and sit down.
Comfortable?
-  C-O-M-F-O-R- - No, no, no.
- That was just a rhetorical question.
- Oh.
I don't study those.
- Study what?
- Rhetoricals?
Come on, Radar.
Stop horsing around.
I'm- I- I'm very nervous, sir.
Well, look, take a deep breath.
- That makes me throw up.
- Look,just settle down.
Now this is not gonna be difficult.
- There.
Good boy.
You okay?
- Yes, sir.
First question.
"What is a three-sided object with two equal sides"?
The Gettysburg Address.
" For which speech is Abraham Lincoln most remembered"?
The isosceles triangle.
- Something wrong?
- No, no, no.
- No, your answers are right.
- Oh.
You just memorized them in the wrong order.
I just peeked at the first few.
- That's cheating.
- It's my only chance.
Nonsense, Radar.
Now you're smart enough to get through this on your own.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Now I'm gonna give you two famous dates from history.
- Okay.
- 1492.
- Okay, hold it.
- 1776.
- 1776.
Uh-huh.
- Now, what do these two- - I know!
- What?
- 3,268.
Congratulations, Radar.
You've just graduated from the Triple-A High School Diploma Company of Dellavin, Indiana.
Oh.
Oh!
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.
Um- Oh, this is the proudest moment of my life.
- Radar?
- Sir?
- Your dad's pen?
- Yeah.
See if you can get the coffee out of it, will ya?
Yes, sir.
" Now, Dad, let me bring you up to date on Frank Burns and Hot Lips- the King Kong and Fay Wray of the 4077 th.
Last week Frank paid an afternoon call.
But Hot Lips argued that she had a brain and Frank was only interested in her bones.
We then found out impossible as Frank is as an enemy, he's intolerable as a friend.
" - Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Abe Lincoln.
- Abe Lincoln who?
Don't you know me?
That's awful.
- Okay, can I do another one?
- No!
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Thomas Jefferson.
- Thomas Jefferson who?
Was Abe Lincoln just here?
Hawkeye, I never liked you.
Hiya, Chuckles.
I gotta hand it to you, Frank.
You got all the gaiety of an impacted wisdom tooth.
Is that a martini?
In case you didn't read the paper today, Prohibition was repealed.
Well, I want one.
- A drink?
You, Frank?
- A double.
Frank, if you have a drink you'll loosen up.
You might even smile.
- Frank, you could break your face.
- And leave out the olive.
Do you wanna talk about it, Frank?
I don't wanna talk about it.
I don't wanna think about it.
I don't wanna think about talking about it.
Hey, Frank, take it easy.
That's very young gin.
Frank, go slow.
That stuff will take the paint off your stomach.
Fill her up.
A, B, C, D E, F, G, H, I I got a gal In Kalamazoo -  Frank.
- #Zoo ## - Frank!
- Yo!
If you don't stop singing, I'll glue your tongue down.
Oh, don't be a party pooper.
- Or a "pooter parpee.
"  -  Frank.
The party's over.
It's a quarter of 3:00.
And there's no one in the place except you and me - Frank, do you take requests?
- Oh, anything.
Shut your cake hole.
Oh, shut your cake hole The more I want you  Come on, Frank.
Knock it off!
.
Close your eyes!
If I close my eyes, my brain won't get any air.
- Your what?
- Well, I got a brain, you know.
I got a brain as big as hers are.
Right, pal.
Right, buddy.
- Pal and buddy.
- I sure hope that's not a song.
Get away from there, Frank.
We're closed!
You know no one ever called me "pal" or "buddy" in my whole rotten life.
You know what my own brother used to call me?
My own brother?
Ferret face.
Can you imagine that?
Do you think I look like a weasel?
- No, Frank.
You're very handsome.
- Honest?
- Honest.
- Really?
- Do you think he looks like a weasel?
- Who?
Ferret face.
Hey, I had a brother used to call me that.
Frank, go to sleep.
You look beautiful.
Are you sure you don't love me just for my body?
Believe me, Frank, that's the last thing we love about you.
Go to sleep.
Come on,you guys!
Let's do something!
Hey, knock it off over there!
Oh, yeah?
How would you like to step inside and say that?
Come on, fellas.
Let's do something.
- We don't wanna do anything.
- Well, then I'll do something.
- What should I do?
- Fall down, Frank.
Right.
Can I see you for a second, Hawkeye?
I told you not to disturb me during the Korean War.
I love your blood type.
I've always liked girls with that blood type.
It's important.
Go away.
This young lady of the nurse persuasion and I are discussing the possibility of a surrender.
She's giving me her terms right now.
Why don't we go back to my place- I think you're gonna wanna see this.
- Where are you going right now?
- To the nurses' shower.
Good, then I'll see you, unless they plugged up the hole.
- Important, huh?
- Yep.
It better be or I'm putting your appendix back.
Terrific.
"Captain"Casey, huh?
- I'm gonna talk to him right now.
- After the choppers.
- What choppers?
- Wait for it!
Attention, all personnel.
Incoming choppers with wounded.
Report to the hospital.
All personnel.
Very good work, Captain Casey.
Thank you, Father.
- I'll give you a hand here.
- It's all right, Captain.
Better let me give you a hand, Sergeant.
The Provost Marshal has a circular out on you.
You're hot, fella.
You gonna blow the whistle?
Be off the base in 24 hours, and never- repeat, never- touch a patient again without a license.
And contact me the minute you get one.
You're a damn good surgeon.
On the level?
Next to you, Frank Burns is an alterations lady.
Thanks.
I gotta ask you one question.
- Why?
- Yeah.
Well, I've passed myself off as a teacher a lawyer, an engineer.
I can do it all.
I just never had the patience to go through it by the numbers.
I guess I never had the drive to get the diploma the permit, whatever.
Try it once.
You'll be great, Casey.
Schwartz, actually.
"I forgot to thank you for sending me your old tuxedo.
It really added a touch of class to our charity no-talent night.
"  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Before bringing on our all-star attraction I'd like to say that tonight we raised over $300 for the Korean refugee fund.
And someone who wishes to remain anonymous gave five dollars for Israel.
-  - And now, we'd like to bring you an act with a lot of polish, and they're going to sell it right after the show.
And here they are, those doctors of rhythm those medics of melody, the 4077 th's own Hawkeye Pierce and his Swinging Surgeons under the direction of Colonel Henry Blake.
Give me an " M." Mmm    - #You'll see a smiling face # - #When whippoorwills call # When evening is nigh We'll hurry to - My blue heaven - Heaven A turn to the right A little white light Will lead you to My blue heaven You'll see a smiling face a fireplace A cozy room A little nest that's nestled Where the roses bloom Just Molly and me And baby makes three We're happy in My blue heaven One more time!
"I'd like to write more, Dad, but it is Saturday night- the one night we all look forward to.
I'm gonna shower now, shave put on a clean uniform and cry myself to sleep.
Kiss Mom and sis.
" - Hawkeye!
Hawkeye, you asleep?
- I never know.
There's somebody here who'd like to say good-bye to you.
Thank you.
I'd like to thank you for everything you did and everything you didn't.
In a place crawling with characters, you certainly held your own, Doctor.
No, not anymore.
Good-bye, my son.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Oh, that's good.
That's good.
- I hope that wasn't something important you just threw away.
- Oh, no, sir.
Just some copies of orders rescinding orders that were never sent out.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Why can't they send us something decent to wear?
I hear they got a whole bunch of winter issue in a big warehouse in Seoul.
Wish they'd send us some of that stuff.
You know, I am sick of going through Command.
- Look, let's send a letter straight to Quartermaster.
- Yes, sir.
Okay.
- Uh, Commanding Officer, - Commanding Officer, - Quartermaster Corps, - Quartermaster Corps.
- uh, Sir.
- Sir- Seoul.
- Seoul, Seoul.
- Seoul, Seoul.
Uh, I gratefully acknowledge the receipt of your latest shipment of supplies to our unit.
to our unit.
The mosquito netting and the summer underwear were very much appreciated.
Oh, boy.
I am wearing so many pair of cotton drawers, my thighs don't know each other anymore.
thighs don't know each other anymore.
Don't tell him about my thighs, Corporal.
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm sorry.
All right.
Now paragraph two.
- Two.
- Okay.
I respectfully ask, however, - that you review our latest request for long underwear, -  parkas with fur liners- Hey, do you know those nice wooly caps with the earmuffs?
- Oh, yeah, yeah!
- Okay, put that down, but in military talk.
Now then, uh- To the best of my knowledge, the entire outfit is enduring severe hardship due to the lack of warm clothing.
Uh, have you got that?
Soon as my hands thaw out, sir.
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening When the singin' fills the air And in the shank of the night when the dewin's all right You can tell them I'll be there In the shank of the night when the dewin's all right Well, you can tell them I'll be there Ã¢â¢ÂªYou can tell them I'll be there Ã¢â¢Âª  Courage, Camille.
Hey, you wanna turn down the radiator?
I worked up a sweat out there.
You're wearin' long johns.
Certainly I am.
You think I wanna catch cold and die like you?
- Where did you get 'em?
- My father sent 'em to me.
Right after I wrote him I'd be home for Christmas, whether Truman said I could or not.
- Hawkeye?
- Yeah?
I'll give you $20 for that pair of long johns.
What?
What?
Are you kidding?
I wouldn't take I'm warm!
Warm, do you hear?
Warm!
I'll give you, uh- I'll give you $50 and a picture of my children.
Stop dripping your filthy germs on my bedclothes.
Sixty dollars.
You can have the children!
Thanks, but I have no place to keep them.
Why don't you take your other blanket and use that?
I'd like to, but somebody stole it.
This war is turning everybody into a criminal, and it's making me sick.
Well, next time try to stay out of the draft.
That's great!
- - Oh, boy!
Listen to that wind.
The snow is snowing The wind is blowing - # But I can weather the storm # -   Now look, pal.
I don't care how pitiful you get, I am not giving you my long johns.
I don't want 'em.
You keep 'em.
- No point in both of us getting sick.
- Fine.
You'd better get some rest, Hawkeye.
You're gonna need all your strength tomorrow.
To bury me.
Some people don't care about anybody but themselves!
Now, shut up and go to sleep!
It's your bet, Radar.
If I have three cards and they're all red, is that three of a kind?
Is that a question for a grown man to ask?
Okay, I bet 20 bucks.
- Twenty bucks?
- Like takin' candy from a baby.
- I fold.
- You?
Foldissimo.
Well, I'm in.
Trouble is, I don't have The Mummy here beat me for 170 bucks tonight.
Well, how you gonna bet?
Could I, uh- Could I interest you in, uh- You got long underwear?
Wait a minute!
I gave them to you 'cause you were choking to death!
You can't bet my long johns just because your nose stopped running!
I got to.
I'm down to my last three dollars and an old brassiere hook.
- I gotta get even.
- Suppose you lose?
- Against him?
- Uh, I wanna see this underwear first.
I have very sensitive skin.
Wow!
Soft as a baby's bottom.
- Okay, let me see your cards.
- You better win, pal.
Ha-ha-ha.
Full house.
Ha-ha!
- I guess that beats two pair, right?
- It sure does!
- What were they?
- Tens.
Yeah?
Tens and what?
That's it.
Two pairs of tens.
Is that good?
You lost them!
How did it happen?
You lost my beautiful double-weave, semi-woolen, sensuously soft long johns to an astigmatic missing link with four tens!
That's how it happened!
All right, bub.
Put your underwear where your mouth is.
Oh.
I haven't been this warm in days.
What a terrific invention.
Can you do that and walk at the same time?
I'd like to eat this before I have broccoli-sicles.
Certainly, Mr. Full House.
Why don't you sit with us doctors so this discovery doesn't get lost to science?
I can't, Hawkeye.
I promised I'd sit with someone else.
Is there a reason this line is going so slow it's moving in the opposite direction?
I just lost a fantastic hand-warmer to another guy, and I wanna see who it is.
She must have frostbite on her taste.
Let's get closer.
How did you get your hands on them?
Uh, well, when you've been around for a while in this man's army, you-you-you get to learn a few of the ins and outs.
What the hell is he talking about?
Put your hand in there.
Oh, that feels so good.
Soft as a baby's bottom.
I'm gonna break his leg, set it, and break it again!
Come on, Hawkeye.
Can I get you some pie?
Would you?
I gotta keep my energy up for later.
Uh-huh.
Can I have some more, uh, pie for Nurse Beddoes, Sergeant?
Sure.
She's got quite an appetite.
If you know what I mean.
You're some guy, Radar.
What's your secret?
Well, I like to put 'em on a pedestal, you know?
Surprise 'em with little gifts.
Put your hand in there.
Feel that.
If he lets everybody feel them, there won't be anything left but a package of lint.
- Look in here.
- Wow!
- Is that a whole one?
- A complete leg of lamb.
- It'd take you a whole weekend to eat it.
- Yeah.
In exchange for those.
- That include the mint jelly?
- You got it.
Something came up.
I can't make it tonight.
There goes the last of the great leg men.
Filth!
This isn't a kitchen.
It's a bacterial breeding ground, a germ kennel!
How long of a walk is it from here to the soup, Sergeant?
About three feet, sir.
And nothing walks faster than a bacteria.
Bacterium.
I've made over 700 meals here, sir, with only one illness.
That was three months ago.
Are you feeling any better now, sir?
I'm not concerned about myself.
It's the men.
- I'm reducing you to corporal.
- Sir, are you busting me?
Yes.
And with a corresponding reduction in pay, of course.
My invalid wife is dependent on my- my sending her a few dollars every month, sir.
- Is this the same wife you had when you poisoned me?
- Yes, sir.
As I remember, I couldn't punish you then because your wife had just died.
Oh, she got better.
See, they only thought that she was dead.
She was stiff and everything, but, uh, it was nothing.
Her death was all in her head.
Sergeant, I would be very surprised if you never even had a wife, let alone a stiff one!
The men in this outfit are very lucky I came in here tonight to get warm and found this mess.
Is your tent cold, sir?
No colder than it was for our boys at Valley Forge.
I, uh, wonder if you know who, uh, might have left these here, sir.
- Double-weave long johns.
- Double-weave?
I have no need for them, sir, and if you want them, you'd be more than welcome to them.
Hey, look what the giant rodent has on his body.
Suppurating pustules, if there's any justice.
- Where did you get those long johns?
- Wouldn't you like to know?
Those are mine, you hermaphroditic weasel!
Possession is nine-tenths of the law, Pierce.
And I'm sleeping with a loaded baseball bat under my pillow, so don't try anything.
If I didn't think it would warm you up, Frank, I'd come over there and beat you to a pulp.
Say your prayers, Frank, or the Tooth Fairy may come and knock out all your teeth.
Imported French Camembert cheese.
Mmm.
Oh.
Frank, where did you get it?
- My wife sent it to me.
-  Frank, how much do you love me?
- How much?
- Yes, much.
How much?
Oh, Margaret, you're my pearl, my guiding star.
Let's drop the poetry, Frank.
How much am I worth to you in cold, hard reality?
I don't understand.
Do you want a loan?
I'm talking about us, Frank.
What would you give up for me?
The moon, Margaret.
The moon.
That would be a wonderful gesture, if you had it.
Now, is there anything you can think of- that you have- that you would give up?
- Gee, no.
- How about your wife?
Well, now, how would that look to our minister?
He lives right up the street from us.
- Frank?
- Hmm?
I think- I think we should reevaluate our friendship.
Margaret, don't say that.
Whenever you say that, I get nervous chilblains and my fingers crack open.
Oh, get up and don't be disgusting.
- Margaret, you know how I hate the cold.
-  You know how my fingers bleed when the slightest winter breezes start.
I can't pick up the smallest little thing without pain.
Yes, yes.
May I give you a pair of heavy winter civilian underwear?
You mean, if you ever get a pair?
These.
You've let me sit here and freeze to death- with socks on my hands- while you've been parading around in those?
You tell your fingers to start bleeding, Frank, and get out!
After you give me that underwear!
Hold it, fella.
Mickey Mouse has warts.
Never mind the small talk.
This is a stickup.
I'm not making small talk!
That's the password!
And you can't hold me up.
I'm a major!
Sure, I can.
I'm crazy.
Ask anybody.
"Crazy Klinger.
He wears a dress.
" Take off your clothes.
Take off my clothes?
Now look, Klinger.
I know you're trying to get sent home as a nut, but wearing dresses is bad enough!
Don't get repulsive!
I want your long johns.
Strip.
I don't happen to have them anymore.
And you're going to be sent to the stockade for this!
Don't, Major.
I gotta have long johns.
I'm getting a terrible draft up my skirt.
If you had the guts to serve your country like the rest of us, you wouldn't have to work so hard to prove you're crazy.
You don't think this takes guts?
Walkin' around all night in this little, thin cocktail dress?
I don't even have a fur stole.
I have to wear this cheap cloth thing to keep from freezing.
- Oh.
- Hold it!
Outta my way, Klinger, or you're under arrest!
Major Burns, nobody takes me seriously.
I'm gettin' tired of that.
Damn it!
I'm freezing myself!
.
Major Houlihan has the long underwear!
Oh, sorry, sir.
No offense.
Outta my way, you freak.
The next time we meet, I wanna see a shine on those high heels!
Ahh.
Somebody, quick!
Somebody!
What's the matter?
Are you all right?
Yes, yes!
Quick, get inside!
Get in here, quick!
Close the door!
You don't know the nights I've lain awake dreaming of this moment.
May I kiss your oak leaf, Major?
Where were you just now?
In surgery, perfecting my old sawing-the-man-in-half routine.
Where do you think I was at this time of night?
Somebody ran off with my underwear.
Well, I hope that teaches you something about blind dates, Margaret.
They were stolen from my clothesline.
They were very valuable, double-weave, woolen long johns!
Your underwear?
Now they're your underwear?
You wouldn't even have seen them ifTrapper hadn't been coughing up his lungs!
And that febrile idiot didn't hold four tens against our throats and didn't get an adolescent crush on a leg of lamb.
Your underwear?
Once you got them, you couldn't even keep your hands on them!
Only God knows where they are now.
- There you are, soldier.
- Thank you, Father.
You're very welcome.
Psst!
Father!
- Over here.
- Yes?
- I'd like to ask your advice on a spiritual matter.
- Why, certainly.
If you need something- I mean, if you're really cold or something- it wouldn't be a mortal sin to steal something from somebody who was kind of a rotten person anyway, would it?
Well, have you stolen something?
These.
Oh, my.
Aren't they nice?
Whoever you took these from must be very cold right now.
Father, if I give 'em back, the certain person I took them from would like to have me killed.
- I've really been trying to avoid that lately.
- Oh, I see.
I keep hearing the artillery going off every night when I go to sleep.
Every night it keeps getting closer.
- I can't stand it anymore.
- I know.
I hear it too.
- You hear it too?
- Yes.
It gets closer every night.
I'm really in trouble.
I was just making that up.
Father, you have to help me.
I gotta get outta here!
Put your soul in order, my son!
Excuse me.
I think you're bending my glasses!
- Couldn't I just give 'em to a needy person?
- No.
I know it's hard, but try to do what's right.
Try.
I'll try, Father.
May I have your blessing?
Certainly.
But you're holding down the hand I do that with.
Now, pray for strength and-and guidance in order- Hello?
Oh, dear.
They certainly look toasty, Father.
Actually, I took the liberty of wearing them last night.
It was getting late, and I didn't wanna bother you.
Had my first real night's sleep in ten days.
I'll bet you did.
Well, better keep them locked up until you can find the owner.
- A lot of people would like to get their hands of them.
- Don't you worry, Father.
I'll ask around.
And then meanwhile, I'll stay very close to these.
Nice talkin' to you.
Uh, Radar?
Yes, sir?
Uh, Radar, have you lost anything?
- Have you found anything, sir?
- I'll ask the questions.
- No, I don't think so.
- Fine, fine.
Then I want you to note that I asked you that question at noon on this day.
Yes, sir.
Is there anything else you'd like me to so note?
- No, that is all.
- Would you mind signing this?
No.
We'll do that later.
Thank you for- Is Henry in?
Uh-uh, some of him is, but most of him is still hangin' out.
Move!
Well, hi.
Are we interrupting anything?
I guess this looks pretty funny to you guys.
Why?
Are we laughing?
We came to report the disappearance of a pair of long johns which we own and which you are wearing.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, can you identify them?
I got a better idea.
Why don't you identify 'em?
- Okay.
- Uh, without looking.
Oh.
Well, uh, they're long.
And they're johns.
That's them, all right.
I guess they're his.
- Okay, Henry, let's have 'em.
- Come on.
If you think I'm handing these over to you guys without checking this out- Look, I'm planning on conducting a very thorough investigation.
- It might take a couple of months.
- We want them!
You're talking to two very cold, very crazed people!
You both can't wear 'em at the same time.
We're gonna have a contest.
Whoever throws you the farthest gets to keep them.
- Ooh!
- I didn't even touch him.
-  - What's the matter?
Are you sick?
- No, don't be an idiot.
- It's a new dance?
It's just a little indigestion.
Now, forget it.
Get lost.
Let me feel your abdomen.
You don't have to feel my abdomen.
I'm fine.
Fine.
I told you it's a new dance.
Very graceful, Henry.
- This hurt?
-  Henry, I think what you're having trouble digesting is your appendix.
I knew you'd say that.
First thing you guys wanna do is cut a guy open.
Couple of sadistic creeps.
Look, this is just your basic gastric distress.
How long have you had these pains, Henry?
Off and on for a couple of weeks.
I thought there was something bothering you.
What other symptoms are you having?
I don't have any symptoms.
Look, it'll all clear up the next time I throw up.
- You've been throwing up?
- Well, uh- Come on now, don't get any ideas.
You guys aren't gonna cut me open.
I mean, nobody's gonna cut me open.
We better do something quick.
This examination is killing me.
He's burning up.
I think his indigestion is about to burst.
Can you make it into a table, or do you want us to carry you?
- I'll walk.
- Let's go.
By the way, I loved you in Duck Soup.
Did you lose something, sir?
Go get Nurse Beddoes.
We're cutting him open.
-Just 'cause he stole your underwear?
- Will you go?
I want a local.
And I wanna know what you guys are doing every step of the way.
- Okay, Henry.
Don't worry.
- I want- No, you better give me gas.
I don't wanna see any blood.
Just take it easy.
Relax.
Leave this to us.
I saw this in a movie once.
- What are you gonna do with those?
-Just gonna expose your skin.
- No, no!
- I haven't even touched you yet!
Never mind me!
Don't cut the long johns!
Clamp.
Attention.
Attention.
Here's the announcement you've all been waiting for.
Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake is the proud father of a bouncing baby appendix.
Henry's doing fine.
And the underwear has been saved!
We're a hit.
Colonel Blake wants to thank you for saving his life, Hawkeye.
- Shucks.
'Tweren't nothin'.
- Yeah, well.
Anyway, he wants, uh, you to have this token of his undying gratitude.
- I hope that's a discharge.
- Oh, no.
It's these.
Oh!
Oh, no.
No, no!
No, no, no!
Uh-uh.
Forget it.
How 'bout-  Oh, no!
Uh-uh!
Forget it!
No, sir.
No, sir!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
- I'll see you.
- Bye.
- Morning, Radar.
- Hi, Father.
I thought you might bet the football pool.
For ten bucks, this time tomorrow you could be a thousand dollars richer.
All the wealth I want you can find in here.
Is that where you keep it?
Little joke.
Listen, Father, you don't have to write your name.
You could make a little cross.
Very well.
Hey, Klinger, you wanna get in on the pool?
No.
All I wanna do is get out of the army.
Just keep wearin' those dresses.
They're not gettin' me out.
They're only gettin' me whistles.
Uh-huh.
- Henry, tune in the game, will ya?
- I'm tryin'!
Henry's not very good with his hands.
- That's why he became a surgeon.
- Very funny!
Hey, hey, I got it!
Here we go.
Whoa, ho-ho!
Nothing less than death will be the reward for you American running dogs of imperialism!
He sure picked a funny way to sell used cars.
With less than two minutes before the Army-Navy kickoff, we pause for station identification.
- This is Armed Forces Radio Service- - Sir, $1,000!
A thousand bucks!
Don't nobody move.
This is a stickup.
Maybe we'll forget the stickup.
I got a better idea.
Am I late?
I had to change.
If you think I'm giving you my chair, you're crazy, lady.
How 'bout one for the Gipper?
Father, Notre Dame is not playing.
Oh, then what's all the excitement about?
Navy, having won the toss, has elected to receive.
There's an electric excitement in the stands as we prepare to witness this 53rd gridiron classic.
- Uh-oh.
- Quiet, Radar.
- Sir, I think you better forget about the game.
- What?
Wow, that's close!
That guy can really kick a ball!
More on the way!
- Check the hospital!
- 4077 th M.A.S.H.
Look after the bed cases first.
Yes, sir, we did hear.
- Sir, have Major Burns look after the hospital.
- Mclntyre, have Major Burns- - He'll work from here.
- Right.
I'll work from here.
- Radar, who was on the phone?
- Regimental Headquarters.
- They just want us to know we're under enemy attack.
- They don't miss a trick.
Also, the Navy fumbled.
The Army's got the ball on the 35.
Terrific.
For a minute, I thought we were in trouble.
- Regimental Headquarters.
- Radar, get me Regimental Headquarters.
See if they can't take some of the heat off us.
- I'm with you.
- Pierce, are you scared?
Don't be silly.
I'm too frightened to be scared.
- Doc?
- Yeah?
How come my nurse needs a shave?
- Frank, you're magnificent in the face of danger.
- I know.
Excuse me.
You haven't seen my crucifix, have you?
- Someone yanked it off trying to break their fall.
- No, Father.
- Who's winning the game?
- I don't know.
We've temporarily lost our country.
Doctor!
- Are we dead?
- Feels like heaven to me.
Gangway!
Headquarters?
I can't hear you.
Speak up, will you?
Fragments came through the office.
Is that you, Mildred?
I'm going to be a little late, dear.
Trapper, check him out, will you?
- Hello?
Operator, we've been cut off.
- What did Headquarters say?
- We never got through.
- Let's try again.
C'mon.
Just a moment, Pierce.
With Henry in that condition, I'm in charge here.
Okay, Frank, go slip into your crown and robe and you tell us what to do!
All right.
- Well?
- Well, gimme a minute.
I'm not sure we've got one.
They're shelling our rears off from both sides!
-  - Get down!
- Hello?
-  Stay down.
Stay down?
Either something that was supposed to happen, didn't, or something that didn't is gonna.
- And if it does, down is gonna be up!
- Hello?
-There's an unexploded shell out there.
-We know, Frank, we know.
- We've got to evacuate immediately!
- I think I did.
Let's go.
Operator, we've been cut off.
Hello?
Hello?
Hel- Yes, yes, please hold.
Hawkeye, Regimental Headquarters, Colonel Hersh.
Was that a- Yeah, yeah, don't panic.
I'm doing that for everybody.
Go help inside.
Hello, Colonel.
Captain Pierce, 4077 th M.A.S.H.
Can you speak up?
-  He's to the 35, the 30- -  Hello?
- Hello?
- You're gonna have to speak up.
Hard to hear with the game on.
We got a little game of our own.
Not only are we pinned down by enemy fire, we just got an unexploded bomb in the middle of the compound, - and everybody's waiting for the kickoff.
- Steady, Captain.
It's emergencies like this that separate the men from the boys.
I'm sure it will.
First, you're to stay put.
Your whole sector is being hit very heavily.
- What about the bomb?
- You have to determine if the bomb is still ticking.
You got any stethoscopes?
We're a medical unit!
Place your stethoscope on the bomb- gently.
Keep the vibrations and the noise down to a minimum.
I won't say anything if it doesn't.
Check the outer casings for markings, you know, serial numbers.
Then get back to me, and I'll tell you how to defuse it.
Call me at halftime, will you, Captain?
Certainly.
If I don't hear from you, I'll understand.
Well, what did he say?
He said if you follow instructions, Frank, you won't have any problems.
If I follow?
Well, why me?
- You're in charge, aren't you?
- Well yes.
The bomb has to be defused.
That's not something you can order another man to do, is it?
- What's the scam?
- We're just about to draw straws to see who defuses the bomb.
Boy, do I know when to come into a room.
Short match goes out and gives the bomb a physical.
- I'm a married man, you know.
- So am I. - I'm not.
- You got more to live for than either of us.
Okay, who bought it?
Just go out there and write down all the markings you can find.
Most importantly, find out if the bomb is still ticking.
Good luck, buddy.
You all right, Frank?
Hmm?
Oh, sure.
I just need a moment to compose myself.
Always, before a crisis.
There.
Odds or evens?
Evens.
The, uh, little black tips, they go in your ears.
- Radar!
- Shhhh!
Who are you shushing?
What are you doing in your stocking feet?
You been at the still again, right?
-  I'm working on a bomb.
- What kind of bomb?
An unexploded bomb.
Oh, that kind of bomb.
Well?
The ticker's very faint.
Not the bomb's, mine.
The bomb is ticking away loud and clear.
The letters, "A-Able, "F-Fox, S-Sugar, Then underneath, three small circles and a square.
You sure, Colonel?
Those markings don't check out at all.
It's not a Russian bomb, Chinese, Polish, Czech- It doesn't even belong to the United States Army.
- Then what do we do?
- Try calling the navy.
Well, why would the navy drop a bomb on us?
Because we're beating 'em Radar?
I put the call in.
We should have Naval Operations in a minute.
- - Father?
Yes?
Well, yes?
It's me Corporal Klinger.
Why, Klinger!
Surprised, huh, Father?
First time you've ever seen me without a dress, right?
Exactly!
Why, you're- You're a very nice-looking young man.
Not that you don't make a very nice-looking young woman as well.
I mean, well, you know, when you wear- Father, this is the suit I was drafted in.
I wasn't gonna wear it till I got discharged, but with that bomb out there, I figured I'll be goin' home in a million pieces.
Well, not necessarily.
I just wanted to be sure you knew why I always wore dresses around here.
- It's only that I would do anything to get out of the army.
- I understand.
At the draft board, I ate the eye chart, I licked the doctor's ear, I jammed his letter opener in my heel.
Not one of life's volunteers, eh, son?
It's only that I was brought up to respect life, Father, and that's impossible with all this killing.
- Quite.
- So this is the last way people are gonna see me.
Like a person with a nice suit.
Unless, of course, the bomb don't go off.
Then I'll be back in a dress so fast, it'll melt your rosary.
Sorry, Father.
Why, not at all.
Sir?
Commander Sturner, Naval Operations, Seoul.
Commander, this is Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake, M.A.S.H.
4077 th.
What can I do for you, Drake?
Sir, we've got an unexploded bomb in camp.
We're trapped under constant enemy fire, we're loaded with wounded, and the only way out of here is through our own mine field.
- There's only one thing to do.
- Yes?
Punt!
Why should- I beg your pardon, sir?
Did you say- - Sorry- -  There's a huge pileup- My advice is, hoist anchor.
Shove off.
But the army's orders are to stay.
The army?
What do they know?
They just fumbled on their own one-yard line.
Look, can you tell me whether the navy is bombing any inland targets?
I certainly hope so.
Then, have you got any armature marked- It's marked A-F-S Then there's three small circles underneath and a square.
Let me get back to you.
I just hope I'm here when you do.
I was saving this for New Year's Eve, but the way things are- Should auld acquaintance be forgot No sad songs.
If that bomb should explode, I'm prepared for us to go off together, Margaret.
If we had only met in another time, in another place.
It would've been nice.
"Nice," Frank?
Just nice?
Not just nice.
It would've been nifty.
There's nothing to do till that navy joker calls.
We just have to sit and wait.
Can't even get that game on the radio.
No, sir.
Twenty-one, twenty.
How do you know that, sir?
Ohio State-Illinois.
Last game of the season.
- I was team manager.
- Ohh!
Two minutes to go.
Crazy Wilensky, great quarterback.
Only weighed 120 pounds.
Got arrested the next year for punching a milk horse.
Anyway, Crazy snaps one off, throws a bomb to Tanker Washington.
Old Tank runs it down to the Ohio State one-foot line.
- One foot!
Can you imagine?
- Twelve inches.
Not 12 inches.
One foot.
Anyway, Tanker's hurt.
Twisted his ankle.
So quick as a flash, thousands of eyes on me, I run across that field and tape that leg good and tight, then run off.
Thirty seconds to go.
The ball's snapped to Crazy.
Crazy fakes a handoff to Butcher Palasco, and then gives it off to Tanker.
And Tanker starts off and hits the ground screaming, his face twisted with pain.
- Tackled.
- No, I taped the wrong leg.
Oh.
Was he mad?
To this day, once a year, Tank Washington comes to my house and shoots out the porch light.
And he's a judge now.
Don't I know your sister?
- Uh, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Radar?
I have a little confession I'd like to make.
- I'll be right with you.
- No, uh, Father- Uh- For months now, I have worshipped you from below.
Why, Radar!
Uh, with all these bombs going off, and the one that hasn't yet, I thought maybe you and I could check out the supply tent together.
I wish I could wink.
You don't need to.
Bomb's got to go off.
I never had such a good hand.
Really, poker face?
I'll open for two blues.
Wait a minute.
The blues are worth $5,000 or $10,000?
For the last time, the whites are worth $5,000, the blues are worth $10,000, the reds are worth $25,000.
A whole stack is worth a million, and at the end of the game, we'll settle for half.
I'll call.
By the way, what happens if the bomb doesn't go off?
Then the whites are worth 25 cents, the blues are worth 50 cents, and the reds are worth a dollar.
Ring!
-  - Yeah?
Drake?
I finally tracked your bomb down.
Yes, Commander?
It's whose?
- The C.I.A.'s?
- You heard me.
- The C.I.A. has their own bombs?
- Yep, and it's one of theirs.
What do you mean, theirs?
I thought we were in this thing together.
The important thing is that little bugger's been ticking for an hour.
On its own, it could go off in another hour.
When it stops ticking, the navy thinks it detonates itself in two minutes.
The navy thinks?
The navy doesn't know?
The C.I.A. won't tell anyone its business.
If we blow up, I hope I rain down all over them.
All we know is it's a spring-cylinder type.
It's got two clockwork-attached fuses, one at the base, one at the head.
I've got the disarming instructions right here.
- Mattresses?
- Right there.
- Got the right instructions, Henry?
- I hope so.
I hope so too, otherwise I'm gonna come back in the next life as a squirrel and run up your pants leg.
Here are the tools.
One for the road?
While we've still got one.
What happened to your two friends who play the fife and drum?
Look, I've moved the wounded out as far as I dare.
Those of us that are staying behind are mighty grateful.
Wait'll you get our bill.
Look, you guys, I'm gonna be on the squawk box to you from the bunker.
Just defuse it, and then run like hell.
But with dignity.
Pierce?
Mclntyre?
Can you hear me?
One more yell like that and you and I will have interchangeable parts.
Heartbeat's regular.
First, you need a wrench.
Now place it gently on the nut just above the locking ring, and loosen.
Now, rotate the locking ring counterclockwise.
Now, remove the tail assembly.
And carefully cut the wires leading to the clockwork fuse at the head.
But first, remove the fuse.
Psst, psst!
- You spring a leak?
- It stopped ticking.
Let's get the hell outta here.
We've only got two minutes, maybe.
It's a propaganda bomb.
"Give yourselves up.
You can't win.
Douglas MacArthur.
"  Attention!
The final score- Navy 42, Army 36.
And the winner of the football pool is Father Mulcahy.
- You won again.
- You always win.
Who do you know?
Name-dropper.
Ah, excuse me.
Now that things are back to normal around here, I have a confession to make.
Yeah?
What is it?
I'll tell you later.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Okay, sports fans, you ready for the next hand?
My last hand was more like a foot.
- I thought that was funny.
- When you're winning, rigor mortis is funny.
- How about UglyJohn?
- He's been playing the same hand for the last hour.
- Winning or losing?
- A little of each.
- Well, wake him up.
- No.
Forget it.
This is the first I've enjoyed him.
Open for five.
- Call.
- I'm in, Shorty.
Stop making fun of my height.
What height?
You have no height to make fun of.
Go get some height.
We'll make fun of it.
Hold it.
Oh, he hears them again.
- Choppers!
- Come on.
The war's back in the game.
Hey, mateys, look.
Ace-high flush.
That was two hours ago.
Those cats in the north really know how to break up a poker game.
They saved me money, but I hate their methods.
Why don't we have a war sometime with blank ammunition?
We tried it.
No casualties, no fun.
There's too much chatter.
It's distracting.
- Especially if you don't know what you're doing.
- Pierce, do you mind?
- We've got five more cases.
- Tell them there'll be an hour wait for a table.
Yeah, put them in the bar, sell them a drink.
Clamp.
Clamp.
I said clamp.
Clamp!
Come on.
Move it!
Here you go, Frank.
Clamp.
- Colonel Blake, did you see that?
- Yeah.
He's a great hitter.
- But he's got a lousy arm.
- I don't need your help, Pierce.
Better check with your patient on that.
Psychologically, that kind of eating indicates hostility, - aggression.
- Destructiveness.
Why don't we get him to eat North Korea?
What he doesn't finish, he can take home in a doggy bag.
- Do you mind?
- Give it some thought.
Pierce, I want to ask you a question.
No, you may not borrow my fork.
Why do you find it necessary to make my life miserable in the O.R.?
Mainly because you're so consistent.
Well, I'm just trying to do my job.
You screwed up today like you do every other day.
That's what I call consistent.
Well, would you mind telling me how I did?
Frank, you're only dignifying him.
- Which is more than I would do for you.
- Well?
You think you're the only one who's busy.
You asked for help three times today.
Three.
Give me some salt.
I can still taste this.
Then when you make a mistake, you're not smart enough to admit it and start over.
- We're not here to compensate for you.
- I'll buy that.
- Me too.
- Well, I don't buy it.
- Neither do I. It's a tie.
Two against fifty.
You're inconsiderate, insulting with your nurses, bloody arrogant, demanding, distracting and dumb.
Wow.
And those are your good points.
You're also surgically incompetent.
- I- - I wouldn't let you operate on me for dandruff.
- Oh, this is outrageous.
- You keep out of this.
Where was I?
- Surgically incompetent.
- Surgically incompetent.
Right.
And finally, you are a total and definitive pain in the gluteus maximus.
- Frank, did you hear that?
- Would you like me to translate?
You can't talk to me like that.
Not and get away with it.
What are you gonna do, eat me?
Knock, knock, sir.
This better be important, Radar.
Uh, it's Major Houlihan, sir.
She's throwing a fit.
Then give her a distemper shot.
I've gotta get some sleep.
But she says if you don't come, she's gonna inform General Clayton.
Twenty thousand miles from home and I'm still aggravated by a woman.
Sometimes I think my wife operates Major Houlihan by remote control.
Well, what should I tell her, sir?
You go right to Major Houlihan, you set your jaw firmly and you look into those cool, killer eyes of hers and you tell her I'll be right there.
Yes, sir.
- Hawkeye?
- Go away.
Colonel Blake wants to see you in his office right away.
Tell him I died and didn't leave a forwarding address.
- Hawkeye.
- Would you- So typical.
Colonel Blake calls you into his office and you chew him out.
You woke me out of one of the sexiest dreams of all time to discuss morale?
Pierce, morale is important.
Absolutely.
But how can we discuss something we don't have?
We don't have any because of your disruptive influence.
- I deny that.
- It's true.
In that case, I admit it.
The idea of reporting to your commanding officer wearing nothing but a robe.
Would you like me to take it off?
Pierce, that ruckus you had with Frank has already spread through the whole outfit.
So what?
Everybody already knows about old butterfingers.
That's not news.
Colonel, if he continues, I'm going to file a formal complaint.
And I'll file a countercomplaint against Burns' impersonating a surgeon and masquerading as a human being.
- He's impossible.
- See?
Even she agrees.
Pierce, I want you to patch it up.
There's nothing to patch up, unless Frank's been operating again.
He wants you to apologize.
In public- the way you insulted him.
Apologize?
Like, "I'm sorry, Frank.
You're a great guy and a fine surgeon"?
If I tried to say that, my tongue would snap off its roller.
- Pierce- - People have to be warned that Frank Burns is dangerous with sharp instruments, like scalpels and probes.
Pierce, listen.
There is a war on.
Nothing gets by you, Henry.
See you in the funny papers.
Oh, boy.
This kid needs more than a new set of plugs.
Look at that.
- Iliac artery?
- Yeah.
The lace curtain effect is done by a fragmentation grenade.
Give me some suction here.
Suction.
What's the score,John?
Well, he's doing pretty well, considering what you're doing to him.
The bleeding seems to have stopped.
Let me have that bone-cutter.
Right.
Bone-cutter.
Anterior vertebral body is fractured.
- I'm gonna go in after that big fragment.
Forceps.
- Forceps.
Do you think he'll be paralyzed?
Not if these ten fingers haven't lost their magic.
There we are, folks.
- "Made in U.S.A." - You're joking.
Just wanted to see if you were awake.
- Private Thompson?
- You did him yesterday.
- Multiple fragment wounds, lacerated iliac artery.
- So what's his problem?
Outside of the fact he ought to be back home with his girlfriend at the movies?
Oh, he has a fever, abdominal pain, urinary output Pulse rate, 112.
Blood pressure, 110 over 70.
I've heard better news in my time.
- Hey.
- This is Dr. Pierce.
He operated on you.
- Hi, Doc.
- How's it going?
- Lousy.
- Well, that figures.
You were on the table a long time.
People were beginning to think we were going steady.
My gut hurts.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
Don't run off and reenlist.
- What's his temperature?
- Hundred and one.
- Oh, terrific.
- Hey, how about a little golf this afternoon?
After the mortar barrage last night, we got a 19th and 20th hole.
No, I can't.
Start him on I.V. penicillin.
-He may be developing a wound infection.
-Right.
And I, uh, wanna get a blood count, so bring me the tubes right away, okay?
- Yes, sir.
- Somebody double-cross you?
Yeah, that kid over there.
Yesterday I repaired a hole in his iliac artery.
I removed a large fragment near his spinal cord.
Hmm.
Penetrate the dura?
No, no.
And no sign of paralysis.
Hmm.
So what's the problem?
Well, he's got a temperature of a hundred and one.
Well, that could be just a normal postoperative reaction.
Penicillin might bring him around.
Yeah, but "might" isn't good enough.
I wanna be sure of it.
- See you at the movies later?
- What's playing?
Bride of the Gorilla and Bonzo Goes to College.
- I think I'll wait for the books to come out.
- Okay, it's your loss.
Hey.
Good luck with the kid.
How's the chicken, Radar?
It's beautiful.
Is that what it is?
I think the same people who make the camouflage make the gravy.
Hey, how's Thompson?
Still downhill.
White blood count 18,000.
Temperature up to 102.
- Hmm.
- He may be developing an abscess.
Isn't Thompson the boy we worked on together?
- He's falling apart on me.
- I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.
- Keep out of this, Frank.
- Well, what went wrong, Super Surgeon?
Operating with one hand tied behind your back again?
Hmm?
Hey, Frank, why don't you let that cut under your nose heal?
Just play kneesies with Big Mama.
Forget I'm here.
Why not give us the whole story?
You shot your mouth off with no trouble here last night.
- Put a lid on it, Frank.
- Was it something you did or something you didn't do or something you forgot to do or, uh- - Get off me!
- Last night I was Mr. Screwup, remember?
Dr. Screwup.
And it still goes.
Oh, really?
Well, I haven't killed anybody this week.
What about you, big shot?
-  - Get him, Pierce!
- Stop it!
Stop it!
- Stop it!
- I'll kill him!
- You'll have to kill me first.
That's the best offer I've had today.
We didn't need the bed, so I didn't disturb him.
Well, he didn't get back to the Swamp last night, so I figured he got a better offer.
- No such luck.
- You fell asleep.
No kidding.
I figured that when I woke up.
You often make house calls like this?
Only for some patients.
Oh, patients.
Well, how he's doing?
Last night's box score.
Oh, damn it.
He's not getting anywhere.
He's falling back in some ways.
All right, same orders, Lieutenant.
- Mm-hmm.
- No change.
- Keep a close watch on him.
I'll be back in a little while.
- Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How's Thompson?
- Is that the only question anyone can ask me?
Well, what's wrong with that?
It reminds me that I'm nowhere with that case, and it's driving me buggy.
- So please don't ask.
- Okay, I won't.
He's about the same.
How about some poker tonight?
I got the missus to send me a check, made out to you, just to make things easier.
- I don't think so.
- You're no fun at all.
Go shower with the nurses!
Ace-king, possible straight.
Pair of twos and a paregoric.
- I'll check to the ace-king.
- Likewise.
Five dollars.
I'm out.
I call.
- Last card.
- Down and dirty.
How much can I bet?
Last card.
Twenty bucks.
Well, if I can only bet 20 bucks- Take it.
- What did you have?
- I don't have to tell.
How would you like to donate a pint of blood through the nose?
I didn't have anything, just ace-high, that's all.
- You didn't have a pair or a straight or anything?
- No.
I threw away two tens!
Who taught you to play poker?
You did!
Don't think you're going home when the war's over, 'cause you and I are staying right here in Korea until I get even.
Can't you guys do that somewhere else?
Why don't you do what you're doing somewhere else?
I'm not doing anything.
Well, you can do that anywhere, can't ya?
For crying out loud.
- Come on.
Deal.
- Okay, five-card draw,jacks or better.
-  Sir?
- Hmm?
- Sir!
- Oh, please, Mildred.
I've had a tough day.
No, it's Radar, sir.
- What's the matter?
Have we got casualties?
- Uh, no, sir.
I was wondering if you could look after this for me.
I just won 800 bucks in a poker game.
You woke me for that, Private O'Reilly?
- Corporal, sir.
- Nothing is forever, Radar.
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, sir.
It's just that I'm worried.
I'm afraid someone will rob me or the mice'll eat it.
You trying to tell me that you beat Captain Pierce playing poker?
No, sir.
He moved out of the Swamp.
He didn't.
He's worried about this case of his not getting better.
Yeah.
Will you look after my money for me, sir?
Yeah, only on the condition that you never wake me again.
Oh, it's a deal.
I promise.
He really moved out of the Swamp?
Yes, sir.
Yeah?
It's eight hundred and three dollars, exactly.
Right.
-  - Go away.
I gave at the office.
I told you to leave me alone, Trapper.
It's me, you rat.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to think.
Well, why didn't you stay in the Swamp?
I can't think in that place.
That place is an upholstered cesspool.
Between the bubbling of the still and the clicking of the poker chips, I'm losing what's left of the little mind I came here with.
- Lose your whistle?
- It's Thursday.
-Well, it certainly seems like Thursday.
-We have a date.
I'm sorry.
Not this Thursday.
I got a case I just can't get out of my mind.
I'm not interested in your mind at all.
- Honestly- - Knock, knock.
I, uh, whipped up a little lubricating oil for the old brain box.
- Trapper- - Is the, uh- Finding a new approach to the problem?
- She was just leaving.
- Not on my account?
No.
On mine.
Trap, thanks for the booze, but I really do wanna be alone.
What's going on here?
Just because I want some privacy, there's everything in here but the kitchen sink.
- What's in there?
- A kitchen sink, sir.
- Out!
Out!
Excuse me.
- If you say so.
Have you seen Bride of the Gorilla and Bonzo Goes to College?
- No.
- Why don't we both miss 'em together?
You young people just run along.
I'll bring you some coffee later.
-  - There is absolutely no one here!
Um, Pierce, I wanna talk to you.
Just take a number and sit down, Henry.
Although I rather you didn't.
I keep telling everybody I wanna be alone.
I don't mind talking to you, Henry, but wherever you are, Radar's sure to follow.
Well, he's at the movies.
We won't be interrupted.
What you don't seem to understand is that you are already interrupting.
- Then I'll say it fast.
- Start.
Look, you're losing your perspective.
You've got your guts in a knot because one patient has gone sour.
In an outfit like this, that's bad.
- I don't buy that.
- You don't buy it because you're dedicated.
- Well, shouldn't I be?
- Depends.
On whether you're dedicated to your patient or your ego.
Henry, don't try to practice psychiatry.
It always gives you a headache.
Colonel Blake?
Did I tell you?
The sun came up and your three-foot shadow appeared.
- Sir?
- Radar, whatever it is, it can wait.
- Sir, could you just sign these, please?
- Can't these wait?
Henry, sign it.
It's so next week we can get Love Life of a Gorilla and Bedtime for Bonzo.
- What would you take to desert?
- I'm sorry.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
But not before I tell you to give up the luxury of trying to be Dr. Perfect in this G.I. butcher shop.
You know, you can save that luxury for when you go back home to your private practice where you can pick the kind of patients that won't go sour on you.
- Do you know something, Henry?
- What?
You're not nearly as dumb as I thought you were.
Thanks.
- You know something, Pierce?
- What?
You're disgusting when you try to be nice.
See you around.
Captain Pierce.
Taking to cruising the compound, Major?
Can't you put your hostility aside for one minute?
Oh, all right.
I'll stack it on top of my anger.
- I've been thinking about Thompson.
- Welcome to the club.
Sort of going over it in my mind, and- Well, is it possible you missed something?
I'm not trying to be a wise guy.
That I missed something is not exactly a new thought.
But what?
There were an awful lot of fragments.
You couldn't account for every one of them.
I thought I did.
Look, there could've been more damage, but where?
Could it have nicked the small intestine?
Impossible.
I couldn't have missed that.
I ran the- I ran the bowel before I closed him up.
- What about- What about the- - No.
Come on.
Look.
You were just assisting.
I ran the controls.
I ought to know.
Well, you obviously don't.
Well, I'll just hang a diploma in the latrine and open a hot dog stand.
Good night, Major.
Good night.
Hey.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, wake up!
Come on!
Wake up!
Let's go!
Open the door!
- What's the matter?
- I'm opening him up again.
- What?
- You're going to assist me.
- Wait till I get some clothes on.
- Later.
Wake up UglyJohn.
Get somebody to prep Thompson.
Come on.
Move.
- Can't it wait till morning?
- I said now.
Move!
-  - Sorry, Frank.
- Let me have some suction here.
- Suction.
- Give me a lap sponge.
- Lap sponge.
- Anything?
- Not yet.
Pick up some scissors.
- These okay?
- Yeah, fine.
- How's he doing?
- Pretty good.
But don't muck about.
He's got a high fever.
Right, Doctor.
Lap sponge.
Sponge.
Bingo.
The shrapnel tore the back of his sigmoid colon.
- That has to be it.
- Anybody could've missed that.
Thanks, Frank.
Okay, let's close him up.
I'm so glad, Hawkeye.
- You know something, Major?
- What's that?
You're beautiful when you sweat.
What do you mean, this is no longer my bunk?
Now, wait a minute, pal.
You spent two nights away, and this Captain Phillips moved in.
- That's it.
- Hey, Trap.
You're talking to one of the founding fathers.
I named this dump.
I threw the first load of garbage on the floor.
- Sorry.
- Sorry, my butt.
Lafayette, I am here.
Hey, you know something?
When I see you sitting there like that in your favorite chair, with a glass of raw spirits in your hand, thinking evil thoughts, I can't throw you out.
If you kiss me, I'll throw up.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
- Clamp.
- Clamp.
- Suture.
- Suture.
- Scissors.
- Scissors.
- Can't you work any faster, Frank?
- Haste makes waste.
- Never at a loss for a cliche, are we?
- Is everything all right here?
It will be as soon as Frank stops sewing his fingers together.
You missed a fragment!
Why didn't you give me suction so I could see it?
You didn't ask for any, Doctor.
You're useless!
The help around here is impossible.
Why don't you find yourself another war, Frank?
- Forceps.
- Forceps.
There's your fragment.
I don't ever want her at my table again.
She's an incompetent bungler.
And you got that from an expert on the subject.
I can think of better ways to spend the morning.
Back home I could be giving some nice blue-haired lady a hysterectomy.
How about selling married couples his-and-her-terectomies?
Oh, you're punchy.
The natural result of pulling bits of hardware out of teenage bellies.
This place is driving me out of my already demented mind.
My head is getting wall-to-wall crazy.
- Would you like a drink?
- Is gas inflammable?
Hey!
Ginger!
Ginger!
Thanks.
Did you know Frank was stolen by Gypsies as a little boy?
No.
Police found him, brought him back to his parents.
They refused delivery.
So the police brought him back to the Gypsies.
They didn't want him either.
And then the cops brought him to the woods hoping the bears would raise him.
After one day with Frank, the bears attacked the Gypsies.
Thanks, Hawkeye.
It's about time for Frank to be taking his post-surgery nap now, isn't it?
Henry, that tooth's really bad.
Hold this back with your tongue.
This is it, Colonel!
This is it!
I know I've asked for a transfer before, but this time I mean it.
I want out!
Ow!
Uh, Frank, will you just calm down?
What's happened to your hook- your hand?
Mclntyre and Pierce, that's what happened.
And for the last time!
I don't care which MASH unit you send me to, I want a transfer and I want it now.
Look, I can't transfer you with your arm looking like that.
There's nothing wrong with my arm.
And you're not gonna change my mind.
I've had those two up to here.
You better cut that thing off before you hurt yourself.
You have no idea what it's been like living with those two perverts.
Oh, they're not really so- They're not?
I take my life in my hands every time I go to bed.
One morning they gave me the "Princess and the Pea" treatment.
"The Princess and the Pea"?
They nailed five cots on top of each other.
I was sleeping 12 feet off the floor.
It's a good thing you don't walk in your sleep.
I don't think it's funny at all.
Of course not.
Nor is it humorous to wake up with hamburger stuffed in your ears.
Hamburger stuffed in your ears?
Do you know what it's like being awakened by a wet nose?
Frank,just leave my married life out of this.
- Watch it before I swallow your watch.
- Sorry, sir.
- You bring a lot of this on yourself.
- Oh, really?
Well, I certainly didn't bring last night on myself.
Last night?
It's not too hot, is it?
We don't wanna wake him up.
Just right.
You sure this is gonna work?
As sure as Niagara Falls.
This is terrible.
I- Oh!
You guys!
- Okay, Frank, you'll get your transfer.
- Thank you.
You know, Frank, as rough as it's been sometimes, I think I'll miss you.
It might not have come to this if you'd had the backbone to maintain discipline around here.
Well, so much for missing you.
This can't be Death Valley Scotty, can it?
No, he lets you sit on his pony while he takes your picture.
If you're looking for the gold rush, take a left and go down the road about 100 years.
Okay, you guys.
What if I told you there's real gold out there?
Come out of the sun, Radar.
Your brain is getting a tan.
I'm not kidding.
I looked it up.
It so happens Korea is the fifth-largest gold producer in the world.
And the first-largest producer of Koreans.
Take a look at these.
I found 'em down by the creek.
It's not real gold, Radar.
What you got there is pyrite.
And if you're smart, you'll see your dentist right away.
I'm telling you, that's gold.
Frank!
Flowers?
I asked for light chocolates.
I'm allergic to flowers.
They're not for you.
- Hot Lips?
- I'm allergic to her too.
What a relief it is to know that after tomorrow I'll never have to listen to you two again.
Having your ears removed, Frank?
Col.
Blake has okayed my transfer.
You're serious, Frank.
You're leaving.
"Absitively.
" Gee, Frank, this place won't seem the same without you.
It'll be terrifiic.
Ha, ha.
Now this has to be the farewell scene of all time.
- Margaret?
- Frank!
Did you cut your head again?
Yes, I cut my head again.
- For you.
- Oh, how sweet.
Long-stemmed- Stems?
They were chrysanthemums, before Pierce and Mclntyre got at 'em.
Why would they destroy your flowers?
Why would they put cream cheese in my house slippers?
Do I know?
They're crazy!
It takes a certain kind of man not to crack under combat.
And we all know what kind of a man that is, don't we?
I talked to the cook.
He's bringing some pork chops here tonight.
The kind you like with extra fat.
Margaret, I have something very painful to tell you.
You can't come to dinner tonight?
- I've put in for a transfer.
- A transfer?
But we can still make dinner.
It's not till tomorrow.
But, Frank, why?
Have I done something to displease you?
- Oh, no, Margaret, no, no.
- Is it something I haven't done?
Tell me and I'll do it.
Or if it's something I've done, I'll undo it.
Darling, it's nothing you've done, or did.
It's just that every man has a breaking point, and Pierce and Mclntyre have broken mine.
But last night you said you loved me.
Oh, I do, Margaret!
Frank, you're crushing my 'mums.
I don't mean to hurt you.
It's the last thing I'd want to do.
And yet you're leaving me.
It's not forever, Margaret.
There'll be other wars.
I'll be devastated without you.
You know that.
-I'll write you every day faithfully.
-You promise?
Just like I do my wife.
Margaret, we're both mature, grown-up adults.
We- Margaret, what are you doing?
Put that down.
It's government property.
It's chilly out there.
How 'bout a drink?
If you need a reason to drink, you shouldn't.
Double or a triple?
How about the first quintuple martini in medical history?
How about you, Frank?
One for the road?
I make it a point never to drink with strangers.
And as of right now, I don't know either one of you.
- It's chilly in here too.
- Mmm.
Make Frank a Shirley Temple and put it on my tab.
You're nothing but common drunks.
That is a rumor started by people I've fallen over.
Laugh now, but when this war is over, I'll go back to my country club and my 30-foot yacht and you two will be ship's doctors on a garbage scow somewhere.
The typical love/hate complex.
Freud said it best when he said, "Never ask for light chocolates.
" You're both a disgrace to the medical profession, let alone the United States Army.
He's beginning to soften.
I almost forgot.
It's time to listen to my favorite Armed Forces soap opera, Just Plain MacArthur.
Soap operas now.
You're deteriorating by the minute.
I'll be devastated without you, you know that.
I'll write you every day faithfully.
"I'll write every day faithfully.
" Listen to that dribble, that manure.
You know, anyone who could listen to that- Frank, you're crushing my 'mums.
Was that- That's- That's- That's right.
Nurse Dribble and Dr. Manure.
- You dirty rat, you!
-James Cagney.
You!
Pierce!
Frank, please.
Frank!
We all bunk together, Frank.
-You'll regret this as long as you live!
-I already do.
Maybe we could arrange to get leaves at the same time.
We could meet in Tokyo.
Oh, Margaret, there's so much to do and so little time.
To think that the army, of all things, brought us together.
Some beautiful things can happen even in the army.
It's absolutely inexcusable!
You two guys should be sentenced to life in front of a firing squad.
Really?
We got over 50 orders if we can turn it into an album.
- Something the matter with your mouth?
- Yeah.
I got a temporary filling and a tooth that's killing me.
Why don't we go to my dentist in Detroit?
Boy, you guys just don't get it, do you?
The party is over!
I'm holding you both directly responsible for this unit losing a fair, competent general surgeon, and now its head nurse.
- Hot Lips is leaving?
- She says she was publicly humiliated.
She has.
And to think of all the times I offered to humiliate her privately.
Boy, you guys are impossible.
Well, fire us, Henry.
Fire us!
Listen, big shot, I'm gonna do more than that.
I'm gonna do more than that.
What am I doing?
This is my office.
You guys, get out!
Hawkeye?
Hey, Hawk.
If I open my eyes and you're not a blond pushover, you're in trouble.
It's me, Radar.
You gotta get up right away.
One more word and I'll nail your tongue to your nose!
I'm sorry.
It's the colonel's orders.
Trapper too.
You both have post-op duty this morning.
Trapper?
What are you talking about?
We just came off post-op duty.
Get your hands off me.
I'll clean your glasses and you'll find out where you are.
Col.
Blake says both you guys from now on are pullin' double duty till he replaces Maj.
Burns and Maj.
Houlihan, which the way things go in the army, could be about 10:00 next summer.
He can't do that to us.
He'll wear us to a frazzle.
I think maybe we finally went too far.
You should have thought of that before we started.
I was too busy going too far.
I still don't know what we're going to do about Frank Burns.
Give me a minute.
- Want a martini?
- No, thanks.
I just put one away.
What are you laughin'at?
I think I have what just might be an idea.
Yeah?
Three of the basic human emotions are greed, fear and greed.
- So?
- Frank Burns is crazy about money.
He married for money.
He became a doctor for money.
If there was money in dying, he'd throw himself under a truck in a minute.
All of which means what?
Remember that story Radar told us about there being gold in Korea?
Oh, Radar.
He's got the I.Q. of a house plant.
Frank isn't much smarter.
If he thought he could get rich staying here, he'd never leave.
Now how 'bout a martini?
I don't care how drunk you make me, I'm not going home with you.
He must have some around here someplace.
Every dentist does.
I don't know how anyone can be a dentist.
Imagine keeping your hand in a bunch of wet mouths all day.
- Gives you wrinkled fingers.
- Yuck!
- Hey!
- What?
- That looks like a gold filling.
- Perfect.
Must be Henry's.
If it is, it's the only good thing that ever came out of his mouth.
-Shh.
You'll wake him.
-How much gold you think we got tonight?
Forget it.
He's still asleep.
- How much gold do you think we got?
- I don't know.
Enough to buy Frank's country club and have him thrown out of it.
In my wildest dreams, I never thought I'd be this rich.
I'll buy you a drink.
Let's finish these and go back to the creek and get some more.
Don't be greedy.
I'm putting mine under my bed.
- Why not under my bunk?
- Stop pulling it!
- You spilled some.
- Shh, shh, shh.
Quiet.
You'll wake him up.
Shh.
Where are you going with that?
- The First National Latrine.
- Aren't you afraid of being robbed?
Have you ever heard of a latrine being robbed?
I'm going with you.
What'd I say?
- Were you talking?
- Oh, really, Frank.
These rocks!
Why'd you pick such an awful, rocky place for a walk?
I just wanted a last look around, you know, sort of a sentimental journey.
It's so unlike you.
You never liked the outdoors.
Well, that's ridiculous.
I love the outdoors.
Any time I'm not indoors, that's where you'll find me.
Okay, Mom.
- - Say what?
Shh.
It's all right, Radar.
I-I-I just wanted to borrow something.
Yes, sir.
Do you, uh, always sleep with a teddy bear?
Well, not when I'm on duty, sir.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Bad man go away.
If I dig one foot deeper, I'll be A.W.O.L.
Gold!
Gold!
Gold, gold, gold!
- - Col.
Blake, I've- Oh, Frank, do you know what- What happened to you?
I, uh, fell down.
Really?
How many times?
- I've got to talk to you, sir.
- Not now, Frank.
I just lost a temporary filling, and every time I suck air it's a new adventure in pain.
I've decided not to go, sir.
Frank, if you think you're gonna sleep here tonight, you're crazy.
I mean my transfer.
I want to stay!
For cryin' out loud, Frank!
I went to a lot of trouble to accommodate you.
Well, tear them up!
Tear up my orders!
I don't want to go!
- What about Pierce and Mclntyre?
- Great guys.
Fun-loving.
- A little high-spir- What?
- Frank.
You've been pushing your stethoscope too far into your ears.
I think it scratched your brain.
Well, think whatever you like, but I don't want to leave here.
- There it is!
- Where?
It's right under your foot.
Is this your final decision, Frank?
Absolutely and irrevocably, yes.
I never want to leave here.
I'm yours forever.
I've got to tell you somethin', Frank.
I've gone to sleep with happier thoughts.
But, Frank, I'm all packed.
What do you mean we're not leaving?
The colonel has rescinded my orders.
You'll just have to unpack.
I've said good-bye to all the nurses.
They even gave me a farewell present.
They must have spent at least two dollars.
Well, Margaret, I can't leave now.
Something's come up.
Who is she, Frank?
Who is who?
You're seeing another woman.
Are you crazy?
I'm a happily married man.
Frank, I don't understand any of this.
- Oh, don't cry, Margaret.
- Ow!
Or go ahead, and I'll dry your tears with a gold handkerchief.
- What?
- Gold, Margaret.
There's a fortune in gold out there.
I've seen it!
Mclntyre and Pierce have a whole bag of it!
Wait a minute.
I smell a rat.
No, two rats.
Two 14-karat rats.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.
Let me prove it to you.
Come on.
Morning, Maj.
Burns, Maj.
Houlihan.
The secret's out.
Come on!
This way.
You see?
You see?
Attention.
Attention, all personnel.
Tonight's double feature is Greed, and The Major Was a Miner, starring Maj.
Frank "There Goes My Transfer" Burns.
-You did some good work in there, Frank.
-You really did.
Hmph!
- We're sorry, Frank.
- We really are.
Well, sometimes a joke can get way beyond an apology.
- Frank, they're trying to make amends.
-  We'll never try to make you look foolish again, Frank.
Scout's honor.
Well, okay.
I told you he was a sweetheart.
Oh!
What are you doing?
Stop that!
- Pierce, let him go!
- Major, don't.
You let him go!
You mean this isn't a nurse?
How dare you!
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Uh, forget this stuff.
Get me some- -  Fifty-fifty?
- Yeah.
- Anybody know what day this is?
- Thursday.
We been here since Tuesday.
Three hours' sleep in three days.
What's the difference?
It keeps us off the streets.
Gimme a clamp.
Quit beefing!
We've still got a line of casualties.
Gimme a sponge.
Maybe we should get an unlisted number, huh?
All right, okay.
Unhook him, and get him outta here.
Yes, Doctor.
One more survivor.
Have to get him next time.
What are these forms for?
Forms to get the forms that enable us to order more forms, sir.
Right.
Here you go, Henry.
Wait a minute.
You don't have to sign that.
That's the phone number of the Dai Ichi Hotel in Tokyo.
- Which is where we're off to.
- Till you need us.
- Room 309.
- Real beds.
- Room service!
- Hot and cold running maids.
Who said you could go?
The war's been sending us casualties on a conveyor belt.
If we don't get some rest, we're going to start screwing up surgically.
Well, have a good time.
- Call us if you need us.
- Yeah, but don't need us.
Radar, two of your best passes.
Colonel Blake's office.
- Did you hear a bell?
- His head's in another time zone.
Just be sure your post-op patients are all okay before you take off.
- Henry, everything is okay.
- Yes, sir,just a minute.
Sir?
Radar, I don't wanna talk to anybody.
Just tell 'em I'm beat right down to my socks.
General Clayton, Colonel Blake says he's really beat right down- Morning, General!
Henry Blake here.
Henry, are you sitting down?
- No, sir!
- Maybe you'd better.
- Yes, sir.
- He giving you calisthenics over the phone?
Quiet, Pierce.
Henry, it won't be official for a couple of hours yet, but a cease-fire has been arranged.
I say again, a cease-fire!
- A cease-fire?
- What?
Cease-fire?
Does that mean we can go home?
A cease-fire?
General, are you sure?
I've just been on the phone with CI NCOMPAC.
Is that good enough for you?
He got it from CI NCOMPAC.
I don't care if he got it from NI NCOMPOOP!
The shooting's over!
General Clayton?
This is Benjamin Franklin Pierce.
I realize you're a general and I'm just a captain, but I wanna have your baby.
I mean it!
I want your baby!
I'll kiss all your stars!
Look, uh- Listen, listen.
I'll be up there tonight for a final drink with my favorite MASH outfit.
That's terrific, General.
Just terrific.
What's that?
Yes, sir, I'll tell Major Houlihan that you look forward to seeing her.
If she doesn't want you, there's always me!
No,just, uh- Nothing, General, nothing.
Okay, yes, sir.
We'll see you tonight.
And thanks for the great news.
- Well, how about that?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna get drunk for a week.
Sober up, get back in shape.
- And get drunk for a month again.
- Listen, hold it, Pierce.
Look, the general was just giving me advance notice.
I don't want this to get out until it's official.
Not one word to anybody.
Understood?
- Understood.
- We will keep it very quiet, if that's what you want.
Hey, Colonel, did you hear?
There's a cease-fire, effective immediately!
We won't say a word, Henry.
You can depend on us.
Attention!
Attention, all personnel.
Any rumors regarding a cease-fire are not official.
All personnel are ordered to continue regular duties until further notice.
Honey, mine was the Scotch and water.
Ah, Corporal Klinger.
Ready for duty, I see.
- What's going on?
What's all the hoo-hah?
- Cease-fire.
The war is over.
- You're kidding!
- Have I ever lied to you, Miss?
If it's true, you won't have to buck for a psycho discharge anymore.
Terrific!
But I'm stuck with a dozen dresses!
Gentlemen, I give you peace.
Sweet, quiet, monotonous, lovely, life-restoring, harmonious, tranquil, glad-about-it, mad-about-it peace.
I'll drink to it.
But I don't believe it.
- Come again?
- It's the same story in every war.
The big guys, they yell "cease-fire," there's dancing in the streets, then they pull the switch and it starts all over again.
Trapper, it's over!
No more meatball surgery!
No more putting guys together again so they can be killed at a more convenient time.
No more living in Shangri-la, buttering our bread every morning with D.D.T. powder.
It's finished!
This whole damn, cursed war is over!
I'll believe that when I'm back home refusing my first house call.
- You really don't believe it's real?
- With all my cynical heart.
I bet you it is.
I bet you anything you want.
I'll bet you 50 bucks they're not playing around.
You got a bet!
- I hate to take your money.
- I only hope you will.
They're passing out champagne.
I thought you guys might like some.
Nah, I'll stick with gin.
Champagne is just ginger ale that knows somebody.
Hey, one more drink and that's it.
After that, we operate and sink your floating kidney.
You know, life won't be the same without you both and "The Swamp.
" You'll miss this?
He's queer for garbage dumps.
I don't like to ask, but if there's some little souvenir I could have- Take it all!
Help yourself.
-Tell your family.
The whole camp is up for grabs.
-Wait a minute.
Steady, Hawk.
The U.S. Army always leaves stuff behind after war.
There's a tribe on Guadalcanal made a god out of a '39 Chevy.
Frank, you're not to worry about me.
You go back to your practice and your work and your house and your two cars and your country club and your friends and your way of life and your wife.
I'm not going to make any trouble.
Gosh, Margaret, it's swell of you to be so brave.
Brave of you to be so swell.
I just want you to be happy.
I wish you could meet my wife.
You'd like her.
Don't press your luck, Frank.
- Major Houlihan?
It's me, Radar.
- What do you want?
I'm asking everyone to write something in my scrapbook.
- Oh, I'm busy right now.
- I just thought you and Major Burns- - Major Burns is not here.
- Then how can you be busy?
- Get lost!
- Yes, ma'am.
"Dear Radar, this is the best restaurant I ever ate in.
Good luck.
Hawkeye.
" - That's what you want to say?
- Right.
Simple, but with feeling.
And loaded with emotion.
Trapper, sign my book?
I'll sign it when the real cease-fire comes.
How can you turn him down?
His liver's where his heart oughta be.
- What's where his liver oughta be?
- Onions.
"Compliments of a friend"?
Boy, you guys sure know how to reach somebody.
Friends, friends- Civilians of all ranks.
This is the happiest- in fact, this is the only happy day of the war.
And it is fitting that we pause to offer a prayer of thanksgiving to the merciful God who has delivered us from this terrible conflict.
Let us pray in silence, and remember those of our comrades who have fallen.
- Amen.
-  Amen.
And now, on with the secular festivities!
Attention, all personnel.
A reminder that the cease-fire is not officially in effect.
All materiel and equipment remain the property of the United States Army.
Anyone found in possession of said property will be prosecuted to the full extent of military law.
- Hold it, hold it, Hawkeye.
- I'm trying!
Somebody might walk in.
They're all doctors and nurses.
What could we possibly do that would surprise them?
- I don't know.
- Let's see what we can come up with.
I'm gonna need that ear after the war.
It's my duty to give you a thorough physical before you go.
Speaking of which- Hawkeye?
It's very difficult to talk with your teeth in my neck.
It's even harder for me.
Please, can we be serious for a minute?
Thirty seconds is my record.
What happens, now that the war is over?
Well, both sides will say they won, Detroit will go back to making cars again, and I can treat kids for mumps instead of shrapnel.
What happens to "us" is what I had in mind.
- Us?
- Mm-hmm.
As in, you and me.
Oh, that us!
Right.
Right.
We've been very close.
Cast a single shadow, as it were.
- You never exactly promised marriage.
- Bless your memory.
But you did use all the right words: love, togetherness, future.
Lieutenant, I have a confession to make.
You might've worn your ring.
And get thrown out of the Cad Society?
- Kids too?
- Five.
It gets very cold up there in Vermont.
I'm sure gonna miss you when I get back.
Oh, well, you don't have to wait till then.
- Sir?
-  Howdy, Radar.
How's it goin', old kid, old sock?
- Happy, huh, sir?
- Happy?
Oh, boy.
In a few days, I'm gonna be back home tripping over kids' roller skates again, cursing out the crabgrass, fuming about my income taxes, and being impossible with my receptionist and turning gray over my wife's checking account and loving every minute of it.
- Ow!
- Did you cut yourself, sir?
Yeah, no problem.
Good old civilian blood again.
Nice and red.
Cut myself last week and it came out khaki.
That's a good one.
Thank you.
Did you get a chance to sign it, sir?
Whatever it is, you sign it.
The only business I want to do with the army is have 'em validate my parking ticket so I can go home.
No, sir, I mean my scrapbook.
Did you get a chance to sign my scrapbook?
Oh, I'm sorry, Radar.
Of course.
It's right there.
Oh!
"For Radar O'Reilly, my comrade-in-arms, "a swell egg who made Korea something special.
"Thanks for everything.
Good luck.
Affectionately, your friend, Henry Blake.
" Okay?
Oh, yes, sir.
Do you mean this?
Every word of it.
- You felt like a son to me.
- Sometimes I felt like you were my father.
Maybe we should get together when we get back to the States.
Hey, now that's a great idea!
Why don't you call me and we'll have lunch.
You live in Bloomington, Illinois and I live in Iowa.
- That's true.
- But you know, it would only take a day or so on the bus.
And then we could have a whole long lunch together.
Sure.
Yeah.
Just gimme a buzz.
Oh, yes, sir.
Well, you- But I mean not right away.
You see, I'm gonna be busy kinda settling in and all.
Oh.
Oh, I understand that, sir.
Okay, you got it.
Then how about two months from when we get home- on a Saturday?
Yeah, I'll, I'll tell you what.
Let's just kinda leave it loose for now, huh?
But we'll do it.
Okay, but we'll, uh, leave it loose for now.
- I'm not gonna make any trouble, Frank.
- I know, darling.
No phone calls, no letters.
I won't even write you at your office.
Margaret, you're a real prince.
I mean, "cess.
" Cessprince.
Princess.
Frank, you're such a ninny.
Margaret, please!
I'm supposed to keep my middle ear dry.
It's Private Gilbert.
You operated on him for shrapnel wounds.
- What's wrong?
- Well, he's awake, but restless.
There's no improvement.
You trying to louse up the cease-fire, Gilbert?
To tell you the truth, it, it, it would've been nice if they could've stopped the fighting before somebody aimed at me, sir.
Next time, hide behind a tree with an officer.
Now, I'm giving you a direct order.
You start getting better immediately, or I'll operate again.
This time, blindfolded and sober.
I think I'm starting to feel better already, sir.
- Keep trying.
- Yes, sir.
Give him a unit of blood.
And threaten patient every two hours.
Captain, could I speak to you a minute please?
Certainly, Nurse Cutler.
That's just for the cease-fire.
I can hardly wait for the peace treaty.
Hawkeye, we have to make plans.
How's this?
I'll get a bottle of wine, you get the keys to the laundry room, we'll both get in the dryer and take a trip to the moon.
I'm talking about our going-home plans.
- "Our"?
- Yours and mine.
As in you and me, as in "us"?
Never mind.
The way we've been, I certainly got the impression that we were- Lieutenant, darling, I have an affliction that will make any long-term relationship between us impossible.
Hawkeye, what is it?
As we're both medical people I'll speak professionally.
I'm suffering from terminal marriage.
Hey, take it easy.
That's stunning, absolutely stunning.
Girls, you'll find what you want, everything half-price.
- Wait a minute.
Kling- - All sales final.
Klinger, wait a minute.
What's going on here?
This is my cease-fire sale.
I don't need this stuff anymore.
- I'll take this one.
- Yes, that's $5.00.
- That was always my favorite.
- I'll wear it out.
Here.
These look great with that.
- Uh- - No charge.
Thanks!
These low heels are killing me.
Klinger, you gonna buy all this stuff back when the cease-fire turns out to be a phony?
A phony?
Sure.
Big boys change their minds and the shooting starts all over again.
- You really believe that?
- Believe it?
I bet 50 bucks on it.
You have this in a size 12?
It's for my mother!
- I won't make any trouble, Frank.
- I know, darling.
- Not one bit.
- You're a peach, Margaret.
Dead women can't make any trouble, right?
Right!
Dead who?
I was just gonna stick my head in an oven and it'll be over in seconds.
And I won't even mention your name in my note.
Margaret, what are you saying?
I can't live without you, Frank!
You're all I have.
I love your thin little lips, and the bristles where you shave your earlobes.
- Margaret!
- Take me home with you, Frank.
Margaret, my wife!
I'll learn to love her.
We'll get along, you'll see.
- I'll be your nurse.
- She's my nurse.
Then I'll be your patient.
I'll catch something terrible and you'll have to see me every day.
I'll pay, Frank.
You can even bill me.
Darling, take me home with you.
I won't make any problems.
Is now a good time?
- See you after supper?
- Uh-huh.
- Same place?
- Mm-hmm.
I've never seen you quite like this before.
- I just found out you're married!
- You don't mind?
Just check your sleeping bag for a land mine, lover!
- Uh, can we settle down, people?
- Quiet!
Uh, General Clayton, fellow officers, nurses, N.C.O.s, and our guest wounded.
Welcome to the 4077 th Cease-Fire Party.
This being a very special occasion, I'm not going to take up time by making a speech.
Instead, I'd like to introduce a fine surgeon, a real cutup- Captain Hawkeye Pierce.
First of all, in gratitude to the United Nations for setting us all free, I am hereby forgetting these poker I.O.U.s to the sum of some $1,500.
You realize, I can make all that back with just one rich kid with bad tonsils.
And secondly, I would like to present a pictorial tribute to the man who brought us this great cease-fire news, Brigadier General Clayton.
You've paid us many kind and thoughtful visits, General.
And I've always tried to mark every memorable occasion with a photograph or two.
If you'd all turn around.
Lights, please.
How many of us will forget this always stirring sight?
Or this one?
Of course, like every great warrior, you had your warm and human side.
Ah, Pierce, I think that- But your warm side had an even warmer side.
Margaret!
Uh, he's just a fr-friend of the family.
Uh, can we have the lights please?
If there wasn't a cease-fire, Pierce- Ah, why don't we have a song?
- "The Star-Spangled Banner.
" - How does it go?
Play it, will you, Father?
auld acquaintance be forgot And never brought to mind Should auld acquaintance be forgot And days of auld lang syne Hold it.
Hold it!
May I have your attention, please?
I just received a communique from CI NCOMPAC.
There is no cease-fire.
Well, we're back in business again.
Attention, all personnel.
All personnel report to surgery.
Incoming wounded.
Incoming wounded.
All personnel, report to surgery immediately!
Here you are, Scrooge.
Thanks.
You should've listened to me, pal.
If the same thing happened, I'd still make the same bet.
On the level?
It was a glimpse of daylight at the end of the damned tunnel.
It was worth it.
- You paid a pretty heavy price.
- So I blew $1,500 in I.O.U.s.
Gave up three nurses for an imaginary wife and family.
And Clayton's got my butt in his gun sight.
My hopefulness remains intact.
Good for you.
Would you mind turning the other way?
I'd hate for you to see a grown man cry.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
A cottage small is all I'm after Not one that's spacious and wide A house that rings with joy and laughter And the ones you love inside Some like the high road I like the low road Free from the care and strife Sounds corny and seedy but yes, indeedy Give me The simple life Hey, how about that!
Weren't they wonderful?
Hey, what do ya say out there?
How about that?
Huh?
Let's hear it out there.
The lovely Miller Sisters.
See ya later, girls.
Go to my dressing room and lie down.
They really are wonderful.
It's a lot of fun traveling with them.
Of course, they keep us in separate cages.
Not that I can't be trusted.
I happen to be married to a woman who's a terrific sport.
She even looks likeJoe DiMaggio.
Joe DiMaggio, yeah.
She's so ugly that- Anybody out there, or have we been captured?
But all kidding aside, I just wanna say to all you guys and nurses what a thrill it is to be here in Korea with ya.
I mean, we're all in this together, right?
That guy's first.
Get this guy inside.
We'll treat his leg under local.
Give him a third of a grain of morphine.
- Now, hold on, Pierce.
A quarter of a grain's enough.
- A third.
- Stop!
Are you going over my head?
-Just through the hole in it.
- Go ahead.
- Now, you hold it.
And that's an order.
- Move!
That's a threat.
- This happens to be a gold oak-leaf.
I thought it was a little big for dandruff.
Look, Frank, he's a big guy in severe pain.
He can handle a third of a grain.
If not, there's an anesthesiologist inside to support breathing.
- Go do what I said.
I'll take responsibility.
- Informed opinion says a quarter.
Informed opinion wasn't lying on a stretcher with a boot full of blood.
You've insulted me in the presence of others for the last time.
Don't forget your hat, Frank.
So this guy with laryngitis, he goes to the doctor's office, he walks in, he sees this beautiful nurse.
But I mean beautiful.
I mean, she's built like a brick hospital.
Down, Charley.
So he walks in, the guy with laryngitis, he says, "Is the doctor in"?
And the nurse winks and says, "No, come on in.
"  Yeah.
But really, though, I know how hard you medics and nurses really work.
I really do.
Although I wouldn't mind being paid for playing doctor.
I can tell you that.
- How am I doin'?
- Not too good, Trapper.
His B.P.'s low.
His pulse is rapid.
Give me another unit of blood.
I gotta go into his chest.
This could take a while.
I hope he doesn't have a late date.
Is it absolutely necessary to make bad jokes while you're operating?
- Absolutely.
Scalpel.
- Scalpel.
I've found it invaluable to make bad jokes ever since I did my first autopsy when my colleagues put a kidney into my cap.
- Sponge.
- Sponge.
Okay, how am I doin' now?
You're fine.
He's in trouble.
- Can I be of any help?
- You could pray for me to become a better doctor in the next five minutes.
Excuse me, Father.
Why don't we do this more often Just what we're doin' tonight Gee, but it's great to get together again Why does it only happen now and then We ought to do this more often Don't you agree that I'm right We make each other laugh We make each other sing Why aren't you at the switchboard?
- You asked me to come in- - They could phone about my wife at any minute.
You just spoke to the hospital.
She hasn't gone into labor yet.
Don't argue with me!
It's bad enough that she's having a baby and I can't be there with her.
Yes, sir.
Well, at least you were there for the important part.
Just what we're doin' Tonight  You know that ancient joke about the guy who saved his regiment?
- Shoots the cook.
- No.
How's it go?
- Uh, Kaplan, pass the salt.
- No.
- I beg your pardon?
- You're looking at one dentist who's not touching anything that hasn't been checked by the bomb squad.
Have you been taking rides in your chair again, Kaplan?
You know that makes you dizzy.
- Reach into my pocket.
- I hardly know you.
My shirt pocket.
Those are my travel orders.
I'm going home today.
No kidding.
You mind if I look at these for drooling purposes?
You unfold it.
If I do it, I could get a paper cut.
I'm not having any last minute infections.
Aren't you stretching things a bit?
I haven't even used the latrine in 18 hours.
Now, that's something I didn't have to know.
Put it in my pocket.
Can't be too careful.
A friend of mine got his orders, broke his leg the next day.
Got it tangled in a nurse at his farewell party.
You got a good point there, Kaplan.
Good luck.
Again This couldn't happen again This is that once in a lifetime This is the thrill divine You're not eating, Father.
- You know something I don't know?
- Something's troubling me.
Think of me as your mother, Father.
- May I make a confession?
- As long as you don't use any real names.
For some time now, I've been comparing the disparity of our callings.
Doctor versus priest.
You fellows are always able to see the end result of your work.
I mean, you know immediately if you've been successful.
For me, the results are far less tangible.
Sometimes- most of the time- I honestly don't know whether I'm doing any good or not.
I used to have a professor in med school who always said, "God cures the patients, but the doctor takes the fee.
" Do you think that's true?
I'm able to do a lot of things in surgery that I'm not really good enough to do.
Thanks, Hawkeye.
But never, never again Never again  - Give me some suction.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Feels like someone used my eyeball for a tea bag.
- Nurse.
Trapper, you'd better not be much longer.
- Clamp?
- Clamp.
Thanks.
Okay, come on.
Stay with us, will ya?
Hello?
Hello?
Uh, Bloomington, Illinois?
- Yes, General Hospital?
- You got them?
- I'm calling about Mrs. Henry Blake.
- Uh, maternity.
Right.
She's pregnant.
You know, with a baby.
Yeah.
Okay.
They're ringing her room.
Can you imagine?
Can you imagine?
- I am becoming a father for the third time.
- Oh, yes, sir!
- Yes, sir, is right.
- They know what causes that now.
- What are they doing?
- Hello, yes?
I'm still holding, operator.
Why am I so nervous?
Gosh sakes, she's got the best obstetrician in town.
Marv Handleman.
He could deliver a baby with his eyes shut.
That's the only way I'd do it, sir.
Yes.
What?
Are you sure?
Uh, sir?
She's not there anymore.
- What do you mean she's not there anymore?
- We'll get right back to you.
- I just- - It's all right.
They sent her home.
She had a false labor.
- She had a what?
- A false labor.
- Radar.
- Steady, sir.
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Steady, sir.
Just sit.
Okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Would you believe that I've got a craving for dill pickles?
That's the last of the shrapnel.
- Better close him fast.
- Gimme some 3-0 silk.
Right here.
I've lost the pulse.
I'm gonna massage the heart.
Get some adrenaline ready.
Hang on, damn it.
- Still no pulse.
- Adrenaline!
Let's go.
Let's go!
It's going again.
But it's irregular.
Oh-   Yes, operator, go ahead.
I can hear you.
Seven pounds, two ounces.
Twenty-one inches?
- What's seven pounds, two ounces?
- Your son, sir.
My son?
My wife's had a boy?
Well, it isn't a girl son, sir.
Your wife is doing just fine.
It's the hospital.
The hospital.
Uh, listen.
Tell Mildred- Mrs. Blake- that her husband, Henry, loves her very much, and that- - She didn't hear your name.
- What?
Henry!
"H" as in- Never mind.
She knows my name.
Just tell her that I love her and that I'll call her and that all my labor pains have stopped.
Bye.
Congratulations, sir.
Thanks, Radar.
A son.
A boy.
Oh!
So this woman gets up real close to the guy in the sailor suit, and she says, "And so what kind of a doctor are you"?
Guy says, "Me?
I'm a naval doctor.
" She says, "Boy, when you specialize, you really specialize.
" -  - Oh!
So it's that kind of a crowd.
You really go for the sophisticated stuff, huh?
I had the craziest dream Last night Yes, I did I never dreamt it could be Yet there you were In love with me I found your lips close to mine So I kissed you And you didn't mind it at all Not at all You've never had any children, have you?
Being single, it never seemed a wise move.
It's too bad.
It's a great feeling.
Why do you sound like a hit-and-run victim?
Me?
- I couldn't be happier.
- Aw, come on, Henry.
There's no disgrace in admitting you're depressed because you can't be with your new baby.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, inasmuch as no umbilical cord reaches 20,000 miles.
Here's to your new son, Henry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But let's hope I meet him before he gets drafted and sent over here.
Say it and make my craziest dream Come true Let's hear it for the girls!
What do ya say?
How about this band?
They're gonna do a little number for you.
But first I gotta tell you about Charley the drummer.
Charley served in World War II.
You remember World War II?
It was in all the papers.
What'd he say?
Uh, I didn't really hear.
One day Charley finds himself in a field hospital with a sheet over his head.
He pulls the sheet down, and he sees himself being wheeled away on a stretcher.
So he turns to the orderly, and he says, "Where are we going"?
The orderly says, "To be buried.
" He says, "But I'm not dead"!
The orderly says, "Shut up.
You wanna make a fool out of the doctor"?
It doesn't look good, Trapper.
- You did your best.
- Too bad it was so lousy.
Hey, what's goin' on?
There's a rumor you three eloped.
I started out to be an architect.
Couldn't handle the math.
Why don't you get some rest?
Over here, Father.
We need some cross action.
The blood pressure is still low, but it's better.
Hang another unit of blood.
What was that about not being sure you did any good?
It's not supposed to work that way, you know.
Now go hit the sack, or I'll report you to the doctors and the architects.
I'll take care of him.
Come on.
You know something?
Those two could wind up- Yes?
rolling Easter eggs.
Captain Kaplan?
Pile in, sir.
Move over.
Do you think I'm putting my life in your hands?
- What are you, 19?
- Eighteen, sir.
My feet have corns older than you are.
- What is that, a disinfectant?
- Who knows where this kid's hands have been?
- Good-bye, Doctor.
- Please, Nurse, no offense.
I'm a dentist.
I know.
The mouth is a playground for germs.
If the tongue weren't attached, it would jump out in a minute.
- Is it possible to bless a jeep, Father?
- Consider it done.
Sir, we better get going.
You have a plane to catch.
Don't remind me.
Even as we're talking, the propeller's getting older.
Well, good-bye, everybody.
- Lucky man.
- Certainly is.
I knew it.
Did I know it?
Did I know?
Did I say it?
I said it from the very beginning.
Jinxed!
Anybody can step on the gas instead of the brake.
- How's the driver?
- The kid's okay.
Figures!
I'm going home.
I'm in pieces.
He's staying here.
He didn't bust a pimple.
You know how I'm getting home when the time comes?
I'm walking.
Look-  You're not leaving me alone?
Would you like a surprise, sir?
Yes.
I'd like to be stolen by gypsies and taken to their camp in Bloomington, Illinois.
- Close your eyes.
- Radar, this is not a good day for playing games.
Please?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Now, no peeking, now.
Yeah.
- Well?
- Just a minute.
- Oh, boy.
- I'm coming.
Mm-hmm.
- Can I open my eyes yet?
- Not yet.
Hold out your hands.
Okay.
Open 'em.
Oh.
Oh, don't cry.
Radar, where did this baby come from?
- Not in any kind of, uh, trouble, are you, kid?
- Oh, no, sir.
Uh, his mother works in the camp laundry.
I just thought since you couldn't get to see your own son- He's a- He's a beautiful boy.
Can she speak English, Radar?
Uh, no, sir.
But it's nice you could smile in Korean.
Aw.
Well, I guess we'd better get back to work.
Yes, sir.
Sir?
In a minute.
You make me feel so young You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung and a wonderful fling to be flung And even when I'm old and gray I'm gonna feel the way I feel today 'Cause you make me feel so You make me feel so You make me feel so - Young - So young  Wait a second.
It's really been both a ball, an honor and a privilege meeting with you like this.
But I can see it's time to go, because they're winding up the rubber band on the airplane.
So on behalf of the Miller Sisters, let's hear it!
Charley Keller and his Claire-de-Lunatics.
And me.
Yes, sirree.
In person,Jackie Flash, saying that we'll be back to see you again real soon.
Same time, same place, same war!
So long now, and God bless ya.
Let's hear it out there.
