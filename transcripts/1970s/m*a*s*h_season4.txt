{START OF EPISODE 1}
- Corporal.
- Oh.
Mmm.
- O'Reilly.
!
- Huh?
Yeah, Ma.
Feed the chickens, slop the pigs.
I know.
Soo-ee!
Come on, soldier, hit the deck!
You're supposed to wake me, you know.
I'm your commanding officer.
Oh!
Korea!
- I'm not supposed to wake you.
- That's very kind of you, sir.
It's really - I'm not interested in kindness.
- I've heard that, sir.
- I've had enough of your oversleeping.
- I just do it in the mornings.
Haven't I told you not to sleep in your uniform?
Sir, the-the blankets itch.
There's things in 'em.
Nonsense.
Did you sleep in your clothes at home?
I was more of a person there, sir.
- Let's go.
I wanna get assembly started.
- Yes, sir.
- Where's your bugle?
- It's over there.
Where?
In the file cabinet under "B".
- And your clipboard's under "C," of course.
- No.
"K".
- I'd like to know what you're doing in this man's army.
- Me too, sir.
- All right, let's move.
- I'm moving, sir.
- Don't you brush your teeth in the morning?
- After breakfast.
- I want it done before!
- That way I can taste the food.
All right!
Gut in, chest out, chin up!
Let's set an example for the camp, huh?
Hey-yup, hey-yup.
Rat-ta-ta-ta.
Hey-yup, hey-yup, hey-yup.
Hey-yup, hey-yup, hey-yup.
Hey-yup, hey-yup, hey-yup.
Hey-yup, hey-yup.
Hey-yup, hey-yup.
Hey-yuppy-pa-pa-pa.
Pa-pa-pa-pa.
Pa-pa-pa-pa.
- Right.
- Sir?
- What is it?
I dropped my watch in the latrine, and I really don't want it back.
- Just purse your lips and stand by.
-  Coming up 0516, hack!
Hack!
Now!
##  - Twenty seconds.
- Check.
- Hack.
- Shut up.
- Shutting up, sir!
Disgusting!
- Today's assembly took two seconds longer than yesterday's.
- Major Burns?
- Yes, Father?
- I have us two seconds quicker than yesterday.
Your watch must be off.
Hardly likely.
It was given to me by my bishop.
- Klinger!
- Sir!
How dare you wear that hat while in uniform!
It's spring, sir!
I've warned you.
That crazy stuff's not going to get you out.
Next time I find you in a hat or a brassiere heh, heh I'll promote you.
Major.
Don't forget to water the flowers.
I'd like your strict attention, people, please.
I have some announcements.
Corporal O'Reilly.
Clipboard, sir!
A can of Danish ham is missing from my office.
It was a personal ham sent to me by my insurance man.
Unless the guilty party, whoever he and/or she is, returns it immediately he, she or they will be severely disciplined.
Two: The movie.
In future, those attending - will stand at attention when I arrive and again when I leave.
-  Sir?
May I pose a hypothetical question?
- Uh, yes, Father.
- Suppose you leave in the middle of the picture?
Uh, well, we're working on that.
We'll let you know by the end of the week.
- Three: Scrub room detail.
-  Stop, please.
Here we are.
This is good.
On the corner of 42nd Street and Filth Avenue.
- Captain!
- No man calls me that and lives.
Captain Pierce.
!
Officers returning from leave are supposed to check in with the commanding officer upon their return!
Hello, honey.
I'm home.
- What's the tab, Melvin?
- Ten bucks, American.
Here's 20.
Buy yourself a new bicycle seat before you get hemorrhoids.
- Thanks, Joe!
- Consider it a gift from a man who has everything.
Captain Pierce!
For you, Frank.
It's a MacArthur doll.
Wind him up and he returns from anywhere.
-  - Pierce!
Stop!
He's defying your authority.
The whole company's laughing at you.
Oh, I'll handle that.
Company, dismissed!
Blow them away, Corporal.
##  Hawkeye?
Hey!
Hawkeye?
Hey, Hawkeye?
Just one note, Radar, and I'll show you a new way to play that thing.
- No, I wasn't gonna Listen.
- Shh.
Softly, Radar.
Talk in small letters.
I have the Mount Rushmore of hangovers.
Six aspirin companies are bidding for my head.
But I wanna tell you folks - Ah, yes, sir.
Ah - You ever had a mouthful of cotton, Radar?
No, sir.
We were vegetarians.
Listen I think I'll have my breakfast in here.
Soap could only improve it.
We couldn't reach you in Tokyo.
We tried for 24 hours.
That was the idea.
I was on R-and-R.
Resting and recreating.
- We couldn't find you anyplace.
- I was with an unlisted geisha.
She did the mile in ten minutes and eight seconds and never left my back.
I just wanted you to know we couldn't reach ya.
And we really tried.
What'd you need me for?
You had Frank Burns and trusty Trapper John champion of the oppressed and molester of registered nurses.
He's gone, Hawkeye.
He got his orders.
He's been shipped stateside.
- What?
- Trapper's gone.
He got his orders.
Trapper went home?
- Yeah, or he's on his way.
- What the hell are you talking about?
How?
When?
- He found out about three days ago.
- Why didn't you call me?
I said we tried!
- I can't believe it.
- Neither could he.
He got drunk for two days, and then he ran naked through the mess tent with no clothes on.
How could he leave without saying good-bye?
He waited around as long as he could.
No note?
A letter?
Nothing?
Uh, no.
Nothing?
Well, he did say that I should give you something, but, uh What?
What-what-what-what?
What-what-what?
- Ah, gee, I can't.
- What?
Okay, but just remember this was his idea.
- How long ago did he leave?
- Couple hours.
He's taking an early plane out of Kimpo.
- Today?
This morning?
- Yeah.
No!
Aw, gee!
I don't mind the disrespect behind my back.
It's the "in front of people"that hurts.
I wish Pierce had gone and Mclntyre had stayed.
- Oh, Frank, have you forgotten?
- Hmm?
The time Mclntyre sedated you and shaved every bit of hair off your body.
He's still better than Pierce.
God only knows how he carried on in Tokyo.
- I'm sure.
- Oh, Margaret.
Margaret, whatever happened to good old meat-and-potatoes Christianity?
Whatever happened to Aimee McPherson?
Poor soul went up in her plane and was never heard from again.
Frank, that was Amelia Earhart.
Oh, yeah.
Well, there's still a few giants left in this old world.
Do you think it'd be all right if I took a pen and wrote in a bold, military hand - "To Frank, with eternal gratitude.
Doug".
?
- I do not.
Oh, gee, Margaret!
Ever since I've been commanding officer, you don't let me do anything.
- Frank?
- It's about time you checked in.
I'm checking out.
I'm going to Kimpo to say good-bye to Trapper.
You're not going anywhere.
And stop leaking on my desk!
Frank, I lived with the guy for over a year.
He's my best friend.
You're exaggerating his importance.
- He was very important to you too, Frank.
- Says who?
For over a year he kept me from killing you.
See you in two hours.
Pierce, we cannot be caught with our complement down.
Listen, Mrs. First Lady, I checked.
We've only got two patients in post-op.
A nurse who was bitten on her nameplate by Sergeant Niles and Sergeant Niles with a broken jaw.
- Papers just came through on Captain Hunnicutt, sir.
- Who?
Captain Mclntyre's replacement.
He's due at Kimpo within the hour.
Permission granted to go pick him up?
Permission granted, Corporal.
Oh.
Sorry, Major.
Hmm?
Oh, it's all right, Major.
Permission granted, Corporal.
Thank you, Major.
Major.
Why are you wet too?
Uh, must be something in the water, sir.
Take it off.
First, get into a dry uniform.
- Rats ate it.
- Oh, Lord.
Request permission to go to my quarters, sir!
- Oh, scram!
- Scramming, sir!
What a dodo.
Frank, look!
Hunnicutt's fresh out of residency.
Stanford Medical School.
Wonderful qualifications.
And look at this.
Tau Phi Epsilon.
- Is that a very selective fraternity?
- Very!
They blackballed me.
- Oh, Frank.
- They insisted on double-breasted tuxedos.
I didn't have one.
- Poor baby.
- I dyed my brown suit, but it ran when I danced.
- You tend to perspire.
- It's a family thing on my mother's side.
Dad was always dry, but Mom sweated a lot.
Yeah.
I've got his face and her glands.
Look at this!
Top ten every time he graduated.
He certainly sounds like our kind of person.
Oh, it'll be a welcome change from all the guff we took from those two "smartskis".
Hunnicutt.
Hunnicutt.
I knew a Dr. Hunnicutt.
He was killed in an explosion at the goiter clinic.
What an opportunity.
Ayoung doctor on his first assignment.
And we'll train him our way, Frank.
You know, Margaret, I have a feeling.
- I'll bet he's Republican.
- Oh!
Oh, that would be too much to ask.
Thanks, Igor.
- Move over, Radar.
- Why?
Because you drive like I spit.
- You're not supposed to go with me.
- Move!
- Is that a direct order?
- Would I do that to you?
- Major Burns will have my tail in a sling.
- He'll never know.
He's crazy!
He's always feeling my toothbrush to see if it's wet.
Wakes me up at night and inspects me in my shorts.
- Radar.
- I can't.
Who lets you develop the nurses' chest X rays?
Huh?
Who stayed up with you the night your earthworm farm was wiped out?
If anybody asks, I'm completely ignorant.
I'll swear to that in court.
Isn't this terrific?
Whoo!
Whee!
Wow, is this fun!
Ya-hoo!
Radar, please.
I'm trying to get a little sleep.
Checkpoint.
- What are you doing?
You're not stopping!
- Quiet!
Hey, you, where're you going?
Oh, boy, now we're in trouble!
He's calling ahead.
What are they gonna do?
Throw us out of the war?
Thanks.
I'll get 'em.
Pull up.
Block the road.
- I hated going through that checkpoint, Lieutenant.
- Yeah?
I got a pretty sick boy back here.
I'm Captain Pierce, surgeon, 4077 th.
I gotta get him to the hospital, 121 st.
What's wrong with him?
Neurapraxia.
Worst case I've ever seen.
What's that?
Neurapraxia?
It's a temporary loss of nerve function.
I've got him sedated now.
Otherwise he'd foam at the mouth, crawl on the ground, try to bite his nose.
Very contagious.
Aren't you afraid to get it?
I can only carry the germ.
Okay, he's okay.
Move him out.
Thanks, Lieutenant.
Love your work.
- Boy, you got the guts of a burglar.
- I'm not missing Trapper.
Hey, was that true what you said back there to that M. P about that "neurotaxicab" whatever?
Neurapraxia.
It's a real sickness.
But don't worry.
Only people who bite their nails can get it.
Sergeant Sturner, report to maintenance.
Sergeant Sturner, on the double.
There's the MATS office.
They'll probably know where Trapper is.
- I'm gonna try to find Captain Hunnicutt.
- Yeah, you do that, Radar.
I can't understand it, sir.
The pickles were flown here top priority with the pimientos.
- Yes, sir.
The general did get the pimientos, didn't he?
- Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure, Colonel?
I specifically ordered red pimientos.
I know how the general hates the green ones.
I will definitely follow through on the pickles and pimientos.
Who's in charge of this delicatessen?
Ah, golf balls are no problem, sir.
How many gross, sir?
Where are your flight manifests?
Stateside.
Yes, sir.
Uh, one gross will be no problem at all.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
One gross, sir.
Yes, sir.
- He left ten minutes ago.
- I remember the Swiss clock, sir.
- With a cuckoo.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I have it all down, sir.
- Thanks.
Pickles, pimientos, balls and cuckoos.
Captain Pierce?
Captain Pierce, sir, Captain Hunnicutt.
- I missed Trapper by ten minutes.
Ten lousy minutes!
- Ohhh.
- Captain Pierce.
- Hi.
- Can you believe that?
- You couldn't have "droven" any faster.
I let that geisha take one too many laps on my back.
- Anything I can help with?
- Huh?
- Can I help?
- No, no, no.
Forget it.
- Let's go home.
- Let's go home, all right?
Let's get outta here.
- Where's the jeep, Radar?
- It's right here!
There is no jeep here.
There's only a whole lot of here here.
I knew it!
I knew it!
I knew it!
- All right, no sweat.
- Gee, it's been stolen.
Listen, I'm responsible.
I signed that jeep out!
I'll have to pay for it, and I'm poor!
Hey!
Holy cow!
- Things always this calm around here?
- It's the only war in town.
I gotta get it back.
Call an M.P. Hey, hey!
Radar.
Radar!
Radar.
If you can keep your head while all about you are losing theirs then you probably haven't checked with your answering service.
Rudyard Kipling.
Good.
Give that man a lady in the balcony.
- Hey, listen, that jeep is government property.
- So are you.
I never thought of it that way.
Pierce, I'm just a little confused.
- Hawkeye.
And don't let a little confusion throw you, Captain.
- B. J. One of the first things you learn here is that insanity is no worse than the common cold.
How are we gonna get back?
We don't got any wheels.
Here is the eminent Captain Hunnicutt, fresh from the U.S. Of A and you and I are talking about cars.
- Let us welcome yon weary traveler with food and drink.
- Kipling?
- Auto Club.
- Right.
- Hey!
Wait a minute.
I can't go in there.
- Pish tosh.
I'm just a corporal.
You think that kept Hitler out of the officers' club?
I really wouldn't want to get him into any trouble.
No problem.
Just let me have some of your costume jewelry.
I've only had five weeks of indoctrination.
Is this what they call a field promotion?
For being brave and nearsighted above and beyond the call.
Losing a jeep, impersonating an officer, all in two hours.
If I get in trouble, my mother will kill me!
What are mothers for?
Hey, wait a minute.
What about my stripes?
Radar, you've heard of lieutenant generals, sergeant majors?
You are now a corporal captain.
Maybe I'd better wait in the car.
Radar, there is no car to wait in.
That's what we came in here to forget.
I forgot.
- What'll you have, Captain?
- Bourbon and water.
And you, Captain?
- Captain?
- Not so loud.
I'll have the usual, a Grape Nehi.
Two bourbon and water, and a Grape Nehi for Captain O'Reilly.
They always fly so low?
They're not low.
The ground here is very high.
- He's not usually like this.
He's just like that.
- You're gonna love it over here.
Camping out, betting on rat races, hot and cold running dysentery.
To think what I've been missing.
- You married?
- Mm-hmm.
You bring your wife with you?
- I thought I'd come ahead and check it out.
- Hmm.
- You married?
- Someone's gonna have to get me pregnant first.
There's two on the aisle.
Thank you.
Does the, uh, captain want a straw?
We don't use straws in combat, fella.
B. J., welcome to Korea.
Land of the Morning Calm.
For 5,000 years, fought over, mauled and occupied by Mongols, Manchus, Chinese Russians, Japanese, Americans, and appearing this week only, Professor Jerry Colonna.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Yeah.
Ohhh!
There's real grape flavor in this.
Tough it out, cowboy.
Why don't you let me stand outside, Hawkeye?
Hawkeye.
Why Hawkeye?
That's from The Last of the Mohicans.
My father was crazy about that book.
He was crazy about Indians.
My grandfather used to sell them whiskey and hors d'oeuvres.
Feel like you just stepped into a time machine?
Two months ago, I'm in residency in Sausalito.
Little house in Mill Valley, Peggy's eight months pregnant.
And they draft me.
Five weeks' training at Fort Sam Houston.
Bunch of doctors stumbling around in the dark, totally lost.
Some idiot shooting live ammo over your heads.
- American plan.
- Hawkeye?
- Huh?
- That colonel.
What colonel, Radar?
There's enough brass in here to make a spittoon.
Over there at 8:00.
He keeps staring at me.
He's probably crazy about you.
Go ahead, B. J. Then one night, Peggy and I are at the Top of the Mark.
Her first night out since having the baby.
- We go home.
Our baby-sitter, Norma Jean, says there's a message.
- Wait a minute.
- Norma Jean?
- Mm-hmm.
- Eighteen?
Oooh!
- Sixteen.
The message?
"In two days, report to Travis to ship out".
Next thing I know, here I am.
- Hawk?
He's coming over here.
- Huh?
- Play hard to get.
- Don't horse around.
- Boys.
- Sir.
- Colonel.
You all know this is an officers' club, don't you?
I'm a captain, plainclothes division.
Uh-huh.
Corporal's stripes and captain's bars?
That's a new directive from the pentagon, Colonel.
That's out of G-2 and G-3 making a G-5 combined officers op-tech glitch.
We're experimenting with a new rank: Corporal captain.
We're here making a survey.
Want to see if everybody likes it.
Uh, asking everybody in Seoul.
- Coleman Hawkins, right?
- Right.
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.
- Put down one "no".
One against.
- Right.
One negative corporal captain.
Thank you, Colonel.
We really appreciate your help in this.
No sir.
I don't like it at all.
He doesn't like it at all.
Play it again, Sam.
Another Nehi.
Gee, if I get gas, nobody's ever gonna believe I'm an officer.
Radar, President Truman gets gas.
They just don't print it in the papers.
What's the 4077 like?
Meatball surgery.
Nothing pretty.
But once we get a casualty to our front door, his chance of survival is 97.8%% .
- That says a lot for the staff.
- It's a good bunch.
You missed two of the greatest guys in the world though.
Henry Blake was our C.O. Henry was okay, from the navel out in every direction.
He sure was.
Henry never made it home.
And I just missed Trapper John, the guy you're replacing, by ten minutes.
Ten minutes!
- We tried to call you.
- You sure he didn't leave a message or anything?
No.
Just what I gave you.
And please don't ask for another one.
Listen.
Major Burns is waiting for us.
That's our C.O. Now.
Bottom of the barrel.
Major Burns.
Major Frank Burns.
Everybody calls him Ferret Face.
That'll give you an idea how devoted we are to him.
- Is he a good surgeon?
- With the same light touch as a German jazz band.
Number one nurses though.
And a good young chaplain.
You'll be bunking with me.
- Not too much snoring, I hope.
- Only when I'm awake.
All you really have to worry about is getting me in my coffin before the sun comes up.
Fair enough.
Well, I guess we'd better start thinking about how we're gonna get back to camp, huh?
- We'll have the bill, my good man.
- $1.20.
Ahhh.
Pay him, Corporal Captain.
- I only got about 70 cents.
- A big promotion like that, they didn't give you a raise?
This one's on me.
You play poker, Doctor?
- I'm not very good.
- Neither am I. General.
Look, Radar, our jeep!
- It's a general's jeep!
- No, no, no.
What they've done, in order to get into the officers' club they put a general's flag on our jeep.
- It's not!
- I can prove it.
Test me.
- It's olive drab, right?
Made in Detroit?
- They all say that.
Mud underneath?
Four seats that can reduce your behind to tears?
- Yeah, but - They didn't fool me for a minute.
- Throw your stuff in the back, B. J. - Listen, you've been drinking.
I drive.
All right.
Deal.
Next stop, Bed Bug City!
Take this thing.
Okay, Radar, follow the yellow brick road.
I'd like that worked into next Sunday's sermon, Father, if you can possibly manage it.
"Strength through obedience".
The discipline of this unit, the lack of respect, is disgraceful!
I've had notes stuffed in my suggestion box that would curl your dickey, Father.
These lads are under terrific stress, Major.
They are?
What about the stress of command?
I'm running the hospital, the staff, the supplies, looking right.
I have one Korean, a college graduate who does nothing but keep my boots shined at all times.
It costs me three cigarettes a day, but it's worth it.
- I'll look forward to next Sunday, Father.
- I look forward to all of them.
I don't get you.
- Major Burns.
Father.
- Major.
Did you give permission that I didn't know about - for Captain Pierce to leave this camp?
- I certainly did not!
- Well, he's not anywhere to be found.
- Nowhere?
- That's right!
- Have you looked everywhere?
Obviously I've looked everywhere if I know that he's not anywhere or nowhere!
- I'm sure it can all be explained.
- Keep your nose out of this!
- Frank!
- Oh.
Sorry, Father.
Sorry, Mother.
Margaret.
Hey!
I lost my hat!
I lost my hat!
Your cookies will be next.
- Holy Toledo!
It's the same M.P.!
- I told them to wait.
- Why'd you do that?
Oh, you didn't do that!
- I'm just joking.
- Well, this ain't funny.
- That's the trick, Radar.
You sure put in a long day, Lieutenant.
A lot of infiltrators on the road.
Yeah.
They sure give the war a bad name.
There was no room for him at the 121 st, so we're taking him back to the 4077.
He can drive now?
It's good therapy.
This is Dr. Hunnicutt.
- Hunnicutt?
-  Yo.
Specialist.
We flew him in for his operation.
Soon as we get back, he's gonna get on his nerves.
And he can drive now?
We put a temporary filling in his ear.
- Different.
- Different?
Different jeep.
The jeep is different!
Oh!
Yes!
Yeah.
Sharp eye, Lieutenant.
Good.
Yes, this different jeep is definitely a different jeep.
We picked it up in Seoul.
It was stolen from our C.O.  What's his name?
Major Burns.
Major Frank Burns.
- Medicine's answer to longevity.
- Frank Burns.
Or Ferret Face.
He answers to both.
- This is weird.
-    Move out!
Stop up ahead, Radar.
Stop!
- Will you stop that!
Stop!
- What's going on?
They're making sure the field is okay for farming.
The daughters are checking for land mines.
If the girls survive, it's safe for the ox.
There are live mines in that field?
I say we don't find out.
Hey.
!
Stop it.
!
- Chung-ji.
- Chung-ji.
!
Chung-ji.
!
- Who's the father?
Are you the father?
-  - He told 'em to go ahead and not pay no attention to ya.
- Is he crazy?
Listen to me!
How can you do this?
You know what you're doing?
U-san!
That's what you are.
You understand?
That's in your own language.
U- san.
That's what you are!
- What?
- You just called him an umbrella.
- What?
L What's the word -  Radar!
How are you gonna get out?
Radar!
- What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Come back here.
!
-  O'Reilly.
!
- Be careful!
- How are you gonna get out again?
-  Radar.
!
- Come on, follow me.
Hold on to me.
- Put your feet in the same spot.
- Watch it!
Come back the way you went in.
Straight.
Just come straight toward us.
Easy, easy.
Be careful!
-  Come straight, Radar.
!
- That's it, easy, easy.
Oh!
Easy.
- Fragments in her leg.
Shock.
- I guess the army's got a few more of these.
- Get her in the jeep, will ya?
- Holy cow!
- Hey, hey!
Wait a minute!
- Wait a minute.
Hold it.
We can't take No, no.
The ox does not ride for free.
- Radar, tell 'em.
No ox, no ox.
- Right.
No ox!
No ox!
You stay here.
-  - What?
What?
- He says there's a hospital up the road.
- Okay.
Stay, stay.
Hang on.
- You've got a lot of nerve, fella!
- That was very brave, Radar.
What?
Running into a mine field.
Did I run into a mine field?
Boy, that was brave.
There's a new officer coming in, and I want this place spotless, Corporal.
First impressions are lasting impressions.
Cleanliness is next to Godliness.
My mother says that.
Why bring her into it?
I never even met your mother.
- What are those earrings doing in your ears?
- Just hanging there, sir.
- Take them off!
- Yes, sir!
You, uh, got anything crazy on under your clothes?
Nothing crazier than you got under yours, sir.
Get rid of these filthy nudist magazines!
Hey, I thought they were strictly volleyball.
- They play croquet and everything.
- Look at these socks!
Boots covered with blood.
Animals!
Here's some people clipping hedges.
That could be dangerous.
Get on with it.
Throw those away.
"Girl phoning".
Wonder what a naked girl sounds like on the phone.
- Klinger.
!
- Yes, sir!
Beats me how some people treat this war as if it were some kind of picnic when it's really a privilege to be asked to serve in the army.
'Course it's notjust our army.
We're here with the U. N which I personally have nothing against, except that it's full of foreigners.
Of course, it's what did in your League of Nations.
Are all the local hospitals that awful, that primitive?
They're about 100 years ahead at being behind.
- Boy, the smell!
- Radar, watch the road.
I'll do the smelling.
-  - Oh!
Oh, boy.
Oh, gee!
I've never changed a tire in my life!
I'll get it.
Give me a lug wrench.
I'll take off the spare.
I thought you used your mother's car.
I did, but she always changed the tires.
Wait a minute.
You're a surgeon.
You'll wreck your hands.
So I'll become a bugler.
I come from three generations of doctors.
I swear to you, I have never seen hospital conditions like that.
What they lack in sanitation, they make up for in poverty.
-  Here come some locals.
-  It's a semi-free country.
- Oh, gee!
- What?
I left my bubble gum in the other jeep.
Whose picture was on the card?
- Rosalind Russell.
- We just won't tell her.
Oh, boy!
That general sure has tight lugs.
We're gonna get him in for surgery one of these days.
Hi.
What do you say?
Just taking our afternoon flat.
Nice to see you.
I just got in.
Wheel's coming off the ground.
- Good job, Radar.
- Thank you, sir.
Uh-oh, Andy.
Holy smoke.
What is it?
The Koreans all went into the woods.
They may be guerrillas, maybe.
Either that or they're having a gang toidy.
We'd better get outta here.
Let's be calm, guys, with undertones of frantic.
Bring the spare, B. J. Out of the way, Radar.
Move!
- They shoot at doctors?
- Doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs.
Anybody.
Any movement.
-  - And I'm about to have one.
- I think I hate this.
- You sure we need all four tires?
-  - Get the thing to take the car down.
Jack it down.
-  - Radar, stop that.
I, l Get away from me, will ya?
Is it down?
Got it?
All right.
Now just get these out.
Let's get outta here!
-  -  - Wait a minute.
- Radar!
This is a general's jack!
- Salute it and get in!
-   Down!
Keep down!
- Everybody all right?
- I've been better.
My legs are shaking.
- Do what you always do.
- Oh, yeah.
- Sedative?
- Chiclet.
You okay, B. J.?
Scared is closer.
There's a bullet hole in the seat right next to me.
Boy, that general is gonna have a fit.
Why should he?
We fixed his flat, didn't we?
Anybody here from Maine?
-  I'm from Vermont.
- Close, but no cigar.
-  How 'bout California?
- Watts.
-  How 'bout Iowa?
- Yo!
- Ottumwa, Iowa?
- Ottumwa did its bit, Radar.
They sent you.
Take cover!
Hit the ground!
- Now what?
- Mortars.
They can make you a tenor in the boys' choir in two seconds.
Where's that stuff coming from?
Anyone see it?
Gimme that radio.
- Able Six, this is Two Six.
Over.
-  Two Six, this is Six.
He's 12 years old!
He'll never make 13.
- Medic.
!
- Come on!
Roger, I see what you've got.
Hold tight.
I'm working on a mission now.
Medic!
Medic!
- We're doctors.
Let me have your medical bag.
- Yes, sir.
Straighten that up for me, will you?
Radar!
Am I gonna die?
Hell no!
You're staying here with the rest of us.
Chiclets!
- Here, sir.
- Bite on that.
We're not allowed to carry bullets.
A little sulfa here.
- Radar?
- Yeah?
Have somebody call in our choppers.
- The 80-double nickel's closer.
- Do that then.
You're gonna pull through, Slippery.
- Captain Hunnicutt!
-  - The guy over by the jeep!
- Right!
Stay down.
!
Watch the flank over there.
!
Watch the left.
!
- It's okay, pal, I'm a doctor.
- It's my leg, Doc.
- Is everything else down there?
- Yeah.
Just mortar fragments.
I don't feel anything, Doc.
I just feel numb.
We'll have you to MASH in a few minutes.
- Nurses and everything?
- Don't know.
I'm new in town.
Roger.
There'll be stuff splashing on that hill to your front right now.
I think the shelling's stopped.
Probably just a temper tantrum.
B. J.?
Probably just a temper tantrum.
B. J.?
Rest easy, pal.
Good shot.
Let me have that bag.
He's had it.
- Well, let's try!
-  Oh, gee.
Radar, tie this tightly around his Sir.
!
Our lieutenant took one right in the wallet.
Don't forget.
This is your first day at school.
The worst part is, you'll get used to all of this.
All right, saddle up, you people.
Let's go.
On your feet.
Radar, we need the bag!
Okay, you're gonna be okay.
Move it.
Move it out.
Let's go, let's go.
Very well, Sergeant.
O'Reilly met Hunnicutt at Kimpo.
He picked him up.
You can just bet Pierce had something to do with this.
Nobody's seen him for six hours, that big snot!
Margaret, I'm going to train Hunnicutt in my image.
Soldierly, efficient.
Yes.
Give me a man when he's 28, and he's mine for life.
- Frank.
- Yes, dear?
For a moment there, you looked like you had a chin.
- Are we there?
- Camp's just across the road.
This is a rest stop.
You look like you could use a belt.
Sir, we really should deliver the captain.
We gotta get him started on his ulcer first.
Forward drink!
- Hello, Kim.
- Hi, Hawkeye, Radar.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Sake with beer?
- Make it two.
Uh, Nehi Grape.
Kinda quaint.
- Toilet.
- Didn't wanna say that.
In two months, this'll look like the Top of the Mark.
Don't give me none of your lip  Any diversion is welcome, except the diversions become routine.
Crazy thing is, hell though it is, I think I feel closer to the people in this hospital than I've ever been to anybody else in my life or ever expect to.
- Keep 'em coming, Kim.
- On Hawkeye's tab?
- Right.
I'm entertaining a client.
- My teeth will turn purple.
Women love that.
I really can't wait to see the place.
- You can wait.
-  You've heard of a military post?
This is a compost.
Everything we've got is surplus.
The lice are surplus.
Only the wounded are new.
Supplies are a joke.
The tedium is relieved only by the boredom.
I can't think of a single reason why we're here, except we're needed.
So, pitch in, muddle through, pip pip and the whole schmear.
Ours not to reason why, ours not to let 'em die.
Drink up.
You're behind.
In other words, do your job as best you can, and shove You got it.
Please!
I'm with friends.
- They're all out of maraschino cherries.
- Kim, some more sake.
Sir, Sir, I'll drive.
I'll drive, sir.
- I'm driving.
- Sir, you can't.
- Why not?
Says who?
- You're not sober, sir.
Boy, I would really resent that if I wasn't drunk.
- You sure you don't want me to drive?
-    He's here!
Major Burns, Major Houlihan may I present Captain B. J. Hunnicutt.
What say you, Ferret Face?
This is it.
Hey, what's going on?
I'm in charge here.
Major Burns.
Sir, this jeep is the property of Major General Cornell Dickering.
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- You'll have to come with me.
What?
I'd vouch for this man's character, Lieutenant, but he doesn't have any.
Snot!
Snot!
Snot!
Have I ever lied to you?
Attention.

Oh, boy.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Attention, all personnel.
The winner of this month's lottery Sergeant Arthur T. Williams will receive a high colonic, worth $9.
Congratulations, Sergeant, and don't spend it all in one place.
And that's another thing I'm going to change around here!
No more gambling.
Frank, it does give the men something to look forward to every month.
Margaret, you're beginning to sound like Blake, soft.
Nonsense!
I want this place to be as G.I. As you do.
What a slob that man was, may he rest in peace.
Another of my new regulations: Under no circumstances will enlisted men use the officers' latrine.
- They've been sneaking in at night, you know?
- How can you tell?
One knows where one's own kind has been.
Major Frank Burns, commanding officer.
A boyhood dream come true: My own command, you at my side an incoming box, an outgoing box.
War.
God help me, I love it.
I better get this new regulation posted.
Corporal!
Corporal O'Reilly!
He left the minute the mail came in.
I ordered him to bring me the mail first, the little sneak!
No respect.
!
I'll teach those dirty, little, enlisted rats to love me.
- Ah!
Done.
Nice little bar.
- Right in our own neighborhood.
- What do we call it?
- It's in the corner.
Let's call it The Corner Bar.
It's been used.
I got it!
"Frank's Bed," now doing business as "Joe's Bar and Grill".
- If my wife calls, I'm not here.
-  - Henry would've loved this.
- Fair man with a bottle, you say?
Henry?
He could have been a comparison drinker.
The man was born with a spare tank.
I really miss him.
How about the Henry Blake Memorial Bar?
I'll buy that.
Let's break it in.
I'll throw out the first drunk.
With any luck it'll be me.
Sirs?
- Yes, young man.
How many in your party?
- Huh?
You can see, we're jammed.
If you give us your name, we'll have you paged here at the bar.
The couple at table 27 are leaving.
Busboy, set up table 27 for the young man in the green tuxedo.
We usually hold it for Cesar Romero, but he sprained his mustache.
- Sirs, with your permission, would you stop horsing around?
- You hate the table.
- The table's fine really.
- Can I fix you a Shirley Temple or a Roy Rogers?
- Is it true about those two?
- Come on, would yous?
Shh.
We're getting a new commanding officer.
- Frank's out?
- Shh!
- Great!
- Great?
I've been sticking pins in my Frank Burns doll for a year.
- Colonel Sherman Potter, surgeon, medical USA!
- Regular army?
- Career man.
- Trouble?
An army doctor!
He'll have people bleeding by the numbers.
He's gotta be a loser, otherwise why would they dump him in a MASH?
A career man.
That's even worse than Frank, who's neither one nor the other.
How'd he take it?
Frank?
Are you kidding?
My palms are sweating off.
I'm afraid to tell him.
- You'd better show him the orders, Radar.
- He'll hit me.
- Come on.
- He's been murder on me.
Making me shave He makes me bathe!
The man has no respect for crud.
Let's go with him, B. J. - A pleasure.
- Would you really?
That's terrific.
Hold table 27.
No, no, no, Sergeant.
From now on, you will not simply slop food onto these trays.
- Look at this random arrangement, Major.
- I'm looking.
The kidney beans have slopped from the bean compartment into the applesauce compartment.
The dehydrated potatoes are in the every compartment.
It's no wonder I never have an appetite.
Sergeant, I want standardization of compartment usage.
When I look down a table at trays I want to see beans, beans, beans, beans!
Potatoes, potatoes, potatoes.
!
- Applesauce, applesauce, applesauce!
Got that?
- Yes.
- Yes, what?
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, what?
Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full?
Where's the mail?
It got here ten minutes ago.
- I've got it, sir.
- Is there anything for me?
Um, nothing from Mrs. Burns, sir.
- I don't care what I didn't get.
- No, sir.
What did I get?
- Here's a card from your veterinarian.
- Time for your rabies shot.
- Wisenheimer.
Shouldn't you be eating or something?
- We had a cupcake on the train.
- I've warned you, Hunnicut.
Don't let this man corrupt you.
- I'm doing my very best, sir.
What else is there, Corporal?
Your service station back home is having a free buffet to open their new lube rack.
They're gonna be having punch, balloons and Greasy the Clown.
Oh, what's this?
It looks official.
Um, oh, you're being replaced, sir.
What?
Smelling salts for two, Doctor.
This is outrageous!
It's completely unfair.
Oh, no, Major.
This is not an unusual occurrence at all.
This is the way the army is run.
We're all merely cogs in a giant military medical machine.
Each cog occasionally has to lose a tooth on the gear oflife.
If you'll all excuse me, I'd best prepare for the change of command.
You took that so well.
I'm very proud of you.
- Que sera, sera.
- It was a blow below the belt.
We've both had our share of those.
No, no, no, no!
It's not fair!
It's not fair!
It's my MASH.
It's mine!
It's mine!
Mine, mine mine!
- I know, darling.
There, there.
Shh.
- I already wrote Mommy.
- Your mother will understand.
- I mean, my wife.
Buzz off!
You'll all be sorry when I'm gone.
You'll see!
- Sorry, Henry.
- Another national monument destroyed.
Come on!
It's hot.
I'm ruining my arm shields.
Major Burns's bed back, sirs.
Oh, gee.
It's a shame about the bar.
I was only there once, but I really loved it.
All right.
Gangway, mister.
Corporal O'Reilly, take your moving party.
Get the rest of my things from the C.O.'s office.
Another week in command, and I'd have had you out of that dress.
I'm not that easy.
Welcome home, Frank.
We kept your lice right where you left 'em.
What's this?
My personal papers during my tenure as commanding officer.
When this war is history, I'll donate them to my college library.
They'll not only benefit humanity, but, uh, they're tax deductible.
That's classified!
"From Frank Burns, commanding officer, to Sergeant Zale, supply".
An order to glue a cracked bedpan?
History, Frank?
Benefit humanity, Frank?
"To the mess sergeant, Hereafter, you will drain the oil from tuna fish".
- Every thousand miles.
- Fine thanks, I get.
I took a sloppy, slipshod organization and turned it into a smooth-running model of efficiency.
I'm tossed aside!
What are you gonna do with all this junk?
Donate it to my college.
-  -  Stick that horn in your ear.
On your feet, soldier.
I'm Colonel Potter.
Oh, my I'm sorry, sir.
I had no idea you were who you are, Colonel Potter, sir.
- Get my gear, son.
- Yes, sir.
Your permission to cover up my "nakedidity"?
- Right.
You got a name?
- Yes, sir.
Corporal O'Reilly, company clerk.
I'm sorry about this, sir.
Saddle goes in my office.
That box in my office.
The rest in my tent.
Yes, sir.
- What were you doing with that shiny cardboard?
- Getting a tan, sir.
- That sun'll rip the hide right off of you.
- Yes, sir.
I was - You expecting a horse later, sir?
- Wish I were.
I've had this saddle since my cavalry days in the Great War.
- World War I, sir?
- 15 years old.
Lied about my age.
Had big thighs for a boy.
I want that filing cabinet over there over there.
Colonel Blake tried it over there, but he found it worked better over there.
I think you'll find it works better for you too, sir.
Over there, sir.
- Blake's gone, son.
I'm here.
I'll have it over there.
- Over there.
Get some help.
I don't want a ruptured company clerk.
Yes, sir.
I'll do the best I can, sir.
Klinger, no!
I saw him pull in.
This is my chance!
- He's got a saddle.
- I don't care.
- He's regular army.
- And I'm regular crazy.
Colonel Potter, sir.
Corporal Klinger.
I'm section eight, head-to-toe.
I'm wearing a Warner bra.
I play with dolls.
My last wish is to be buried in my mother's wedding gown.
I'm nuts.
I should be out.
Horse hockey.
I've seen these dodges for Knew a private, pretended he was a mare.
Carried a colt in his arms for weeks.
Another fellow said he was a daisy.
Insisted we water him every morning.
No, no, Corporal.
It ain't gonna go with me.
Now you get out of that froufrou and into a uniform.
And you stay in uniform.
Dismissed!
Radar, I'm finished.
I gotta burn my bloomers.
I see him around sometimes.
- Right here will be fine.
- Yes, sir.
- I wanna see my officers.
- Yes, sir.
Why, uh, "Radar"?
Oh, well, uh sometimes I can tell what's gonna happen before it happens.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.
The officers' latrine is to the right, sir.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
##   Sorry, camp.
Attention, by command of the new commanding officer all officers report to the commanding officer's office, sirs.
Father Mulcahy.
Oh, yes.
Of course.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.
You're clean.
- Thank God, sir.
- Catholic?
- Yes, sir.
Can you do a Methodist thing for me on Sunday?
- I handle all denominations, Colonel.
- Any other Methodists in the outfit?
- Two or three.
- Good.
I hate to sing alone.
- Major Houlihan.
- Sir!
- Chief nurse.
- Yes, sir.
- Ten years, spotless record.
- Thank you, sir.
Major Frank Burns.
Just friends, sir.
I mean, he's not here, sir.
He's indisposed.
- Captain Pierce.
- Yo!
Keep your yo's to yourself.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
- Captain Hunnicutt.
- Yes, sir.
You two were reprimanded by Major Burns for setting fire to the latrine.
- That was an accident.
- We were having a weenie roast.
- In the latrine?
- We're not allowed to cook in our tents, sir.
Also, Pierce, it says here you had a live chicken flown here by helicopter, claiming it was a patient.
That was a rare bird, Colonel.
It could tap-dance.
And a year ago the Tokyo provost marshal claims you stole a steam shovel.
I couldn't get a cab.
- I gather you drink.
- Only to excess.
Colorful officers, I must say.
That is one thing I do not need.
I would greatly appreciate it if, for the next 18 months, you keep your noses clean.
Dismissed!
It's terrific of Frank to put all that stuff in our service records.
Just where is No Lips?
He left.
He was so upset when he didn't get the command.
He just took off.
- You're kidding!
Frank's run away from home?
- Shh!
No.
Not a word.
- Oh, okay.
I won't say anything.
Not a word.
- My lips are sealed.
- Attention, all personnel.
You won't believe this, camp.
- Oh, Pierce!
- Hello, camp.
Are you there, camp?
- Pierce.
Pierce.
Would you, please?
I'm trying to say Think Potter will object to the still?
If he makes me get rid of it, I'm gonna get into one of Klinger's dresses.
- Not while he's wearing it, I hope.
- We'll see.
- Sirs?
- Speaking of Mrs. Devil.
What's the matter?
What's with the arms and legs?
Look!
Ah!
Wherever my uniform covers me, I got a rash.
- You ever been allergic to cotton?
Wools?
Synthetics?
- No, sir.
Ah!
Now for the $2 question.
Have you been over to Rosie's Bar to visit a business girl?
No, no.
They don't like me.
They're jealous of my clothes.
- Have your freckles been moving from one spot to another?
- Oh, no.
If you're referring to tiny livestock, sir, I'm very careful about that.
Ah!
Rash ends where the uniform ends.
- Psychosomatic?
- Elementary.
Started the minute I got out of my civvies.
- Civvies!
That's it.
- Civvies!
Of course.
Your ladies' clothes are your defense against the system.
- What do I do?
- Simple!
Take two aspirin and wear your best slip next to your skin.
Is that an order, sir?
- Why not?
- Thank you, sir!
- Straighten Lillie Bell.
She's crooked.
- Oh.
That's Royal King!
Can't you tell a mare from a stallion?
- Sorry, sir.
I'm good at hamsters.
- Hamsters?
All they ever do is eat lettuce and make jelly beans.
Yes, sir.
What do you want me to do with this lady's picture, sir?
Up here?
No, no.
That's Mrs. Potter.
She always goes on the right side of my desk.
- Oh.
Nice lady, sir.
- Five sisters, and not a bum in the lot.
Right on the right side.
Good.
I never start a day without throwing Mrs. Potter a salute.
Or, in lieu thereof, Mrs. Potter's picture.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
Good conduct medal with a clasp.
Only an enlisted man can get one.
- MacArthur hasn't got one.
Bradley neither.
- Wow!
It sure is nice to know that you were once as common as I am, sir.
- What is it?
- Choppers, sir.
- I don't hear anything.
-  Choppers.
!
Attention.
!
Attention, all personnel.
Incoming wounded.
Both shifts to O.R. On the double.
Incoming wounded.
Let's go.
Let's go, people.
Coming, sir.
- What did you find out?
- He's mostly administration.
- He hasn't been in an operating room for two years!
- Terrific.
Margaret, if this guy's a klutz, if he gets into any trouble, give me a nudge.
Or B. J. - Right.
Corporal is it dark outside yet?
- Almost, ma'am.
- Who cares?
- Major Burns.
He might be cold.
Or hurt.
Or lost.
Major, he's throwing a temper tantrum.
He'll come home when he gets hungry, Mommy.
- You ready?
- I hope so.
This way to the body and fender shop!
Clamp.
Right in there.
Done!
Get him into post-op.
Start him on 600,000 units of penicillin, V.I.P. Litter!
- Next!
- Hold the clamp.
- How you doin'?
- You don't get many bellies like this back home.
Comes from eating too many bullets.
- Close.
I've got two Penrose drains in him.
- Yes.
- How's he doing?
- So far, fine.
Simple operations.
Keep your eye on him.
Four-oh silk.
- May I?
- Sure, Colonel.
I'd resect that area of small intestine.
It may be ischemic.
Planning to do that, Colonel, just as soon as I get this bleeding stopped.
- Uh-huh.
- Clamp.
- How's the rash?
- Upstairs, terrible.
Downstairs, okay.
- How come?
- Wearing a half-slip.
Clamp.
- Got a bad bleeder here.
- Oh, my Lord!
Retract that a bit more.
Get some suction in there.
Suction!
Give me that.
Can you get that bowel out of the way?
- I need some help here.
- Pack it off.
Keep the pressure on it.
You're not gonna lose him.
Ah, you're doing just fine, son.
- Little more suction, Nurse.
-  - Thank you, Doctor.
- Yeah, that's coming along.
Put him under.
Colonel, you did a nice job with that kid in there.
You handled the rough part.
They were pretty shaky going in, I gotta tell ya.
Sittin' behind a desk for two years, I thought I mighta' lost my touch.
I guess surgery's like a bicycle.
Once you learn it, you never forget.
Nice to know there's a little pizzazz left in the old digits.
- What time is it?
- 3:30 a.m. I could use a belt.
Colonel, Captain Hunnicutt and I know just the place.
- Checkered tablecloths, candlelight - Out here?
Pizza?
- No, but you can chew on a rubber glove.
-  - Talk about your backs.
- Here, turn around.
- Oh!
Dandy.
- Uh-huh?
Learned that from an old Arab.
He liked flat camels.
-  -    Margaret!
Margaret!
Margaret!
It's me, Frank.
Frank!
Oh, Frank, my darling.
Are you all right?
Where have you been?
What happened to you?
I've been worried sick!
It was awful out there.
All dark.
I was hungry.
- A dog chased me and bit my duffel bag.
- Poor darling.
- What happened to your clothes?
- I fell down.
Oh, there, there.
Oh, it's so good to be home.
Oh!
- Did anybody miss me?
- I did, sugar.
What about the colonel?
And Pierce?
And Hunnicutt?
- Did they even care?
Were they upset?
- Of course they were.
- Margaret, I know this isn't the time to ask.
- Ask, darling.
But after stumbling around in the dark, and here you are, all warm and loving Ask, Frank.
Ask.
Have you got any cookies?

- To Bess Truman.
To Margaret Truman.
To err is Truman.
That's not bad.
If you boys generate a little more heat and wrap a little tinfoil around the top, you'll get a better yield.
- And you'll land in jail.
- And his orchestra.
I had a still in Guam in World War II.
One night it blew up.
That's how I got my Purple Heart.

Bought her in '47.
From the hubcaps she looks like a '46.
This is Sylvia Bee, Opel's Pride's sister.
Look at that rump.
You can tell they're sisters.
You've got an eye for horseflesh, Hawkeye.
He's good at rumps.
Colonel, sir, Major Frank Burns.
Reporting for duty, sir.
That's a nasty bruise, Major.
Pain is, uh, no stranger to me, sir.
He's had athlete's foot all his life.
The colonel can count on me as his second-in-command to maintain peak military efficiency and discipline, which I established.
I appreciate that, Major.
Colonel Potter, sir!
- I found your bridle.
- Good.
- It was in with the trusses.
- Thank you, son.
Klinger!
Nice outfit.
Thank you, sir.
It's from the Shirley Temple collection.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Attention!
The temperature is now two degrees below zero.
Tonight's forecast cold, with a good chance ofbad weather tomorrow.
Due to enemy shelling, we will observe blackout conditions effective immediately.
Blackout conditions, please.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry, ma'am.
And, uh, thank you.
Oh.
Ahhh.
Hawk, it's that time.
- Hawkeye?
- He's dead.
Dead and drafted.
You're on duty.
It's no-hundred hours.
Midnight.
I'll give you ten dollars for ten more minutes.
- Please?
- Five for five?
- Come on.
- Would you take a dollar to smother me with my pillow?
- Come on.
They're waiting.
-  Oh, the price of fame.
Rats!
- Who'd you bump into?
- Just what I said.
Rats.
If they get any bigger, we can hold a rodeo.
- It's colder.
- I keep begging the janitor for more heat.
Keep your eye on a kid named Edwards.
I took a junkyard out of his belly.
Edwards, right.
-  -  - Aren't you gonna have it?
- Nah, one golf ball and I'm up all night.
He's already had ten units.
- Edwards?
- Yeah.
- That's lotsa blood.
- He was lotsa hurt.
- You wanna go over there into first-class and tuck him in?
- Yes, sir.
You know, after this war is over, you're going to make somebody a fine mother.
Aw, cut it out once.
Hello, Klinger.
How goes the crazy business?
You think MacArthur reads his mail?
Probably at night after he takes off his makeup.
I sent him a picture of me in a garter belt.
He sent back one of him smoking a pipe.
I think he got the best of it.
Oh.
Captain Pierce, Private Jenkins.
Just got in this morning.
- Sir.
- You brought the good weather with you.
Warmest July in years.
Pardon the sock.
Captain here is one of the good guys.
My white hat's out being cleaned and blocked.
That's my midnight snack.
from World War II.
They're has-beans.
Can't get rich around here.
First time on night sentry duty.
No problem.
If there's anything out there, it'll freeze before it can make trouble.
Yes, sir.
Hey, listen.
Everybody's scared.
Honest?
Are you kiddin'?
Winner of the Purple Chicken with Yellow Belly clusters.
- Animal.
- It's just me, ma'am.
-  -  - Are you crazy?
- It's my job.
It's midnight.
You're on duty.
How long have you been standing there Iooking at me?
Not long really.
Just a little long.
Honest.
Get out of here, you little creep, pervert you!
Get out!
You're not the first one in this man's army to drool over me with your hot, little non-com breath!
I didn't!
I never breathe around you.
Get out of my underwear!
- I'm trying to, sir ma'am!
-  - Help!
-  - Frank.
- Oh, sure.
Do you know what time it is?
The big hand's on two and the little hand's on 12.
- You're 10 minutes late, Captain.
- I don't like overtures anyway.
- I should have been relieved at midnight.
- Put in for overtime.
- It really gripes my cookies.
- Frank?
- Hmm?
- Would you like to see me start a fire by rubbing your ears together?
- Oh.
Good evening, Major.
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- That's perfectly all right.
- I had to bring a note from home.
- What?
- Let's go.
Let's go.
- Edwards.
- This is B. J.'s kid.
He's been quiet, resting comfortably.
No trouble.
That's pretty low, Frank.
If your pressure was 85 over 50, you'd be no trouble either.
Maybe he's no trouble now, but he's already used up ten units of blood.
Saving it to paint the mess tent, Frank?
Take his pressure and pulse every ten minutes.
Have some more units of whole blood ready.
- Who's this?
- Abbott.
What are you staring at?
Just get away from me, all right?
Get away.
- One of your nervous Nellies.
- What's he got to be nervous about, Frank?
Just 'cause he's a million miles from home with more tubes in him than a radio?
- He's here to do a job like the rest of us.
- Stay away from me.
Hey, hey, hey.
You can't thrash around like that, pal.
- I don't want him touching me.
- You don't have any choice.
He's a doctor.
- So shut your yap.
- You can tell he's a doctor by his bedside manner.
Let's have a calm night, huh?
We can both use it.
He's, uh  Chinese.
You don't have to whisper, Frank.
He knows he's Chinese.
They're crafty devils.
This one's probably not one of their craftiest.
He's got 13 broken bones.
I don't trust them.
I bet he understands every word we say.
I certainly wouldn't trust anybody who understands us.
Would you feel safer if I put a guard on him, Major?
Come on, Frank!
This poor bugger couldn't break the four-hour mile.
- I'll be all right.
- Well Major, Captain, I'll leave you two to carry on.
Pst.
Pst.
- Frank!
- Hmm?
You tore up my note.
I read it, darling.
I'm dying to keep you warm too.
- Why did you tear it up?
- I tear up all your notes.
You got some real doozies in there.
- As well as my feelings.
- Oh, sure.
And those too.
- I've saved everything you've ever written me.
- No kidding?
Everything?
- Every scrap.
-  - Margaret, do you think that's such a good idea?
- What?
- There's a war on.
- I know, Frank.
I can hear it.
I don't like to say this, but, um You could get killed, you know, Margaret.
Somebody makes up the statistics.
I don't wish you any bad luck, but if you should, uh - and someone got to your things before I did - Frank!
- Hmm?
- You could get killed too.
Now that's cruel.
-  - Aaah!
- It's okay.
- Get off me!
Don't touch me!
- Get your arms down.
-  Stop!
Make 'em stop.
Please!
Make 'em stop.
Just what the war needed, extra innings.
- Radar.
-  - 386!
Six!
Like a nine sitting down.
- I want you to make a call.
I'm trying to get the shelling stopped.
It's outgoing.
- That's our stuff?
- We can't let them have all the fun.
-  - 386?
This is MASH 4077.
- Can you cut the heavy overhead stuff?
We're a hospital here.
-  - We got patients.
- What?
He's got a suggestion, but I think it's physically impossible.
- Give me the phone.
Who is this?
- Lieutenant Gage.
Lieutenant Gage, Captain Pierce here.
Those shells of yours are bouncing our guys right out of their beds.
Give us a break, huh?
We're on the same team.
Uh-huh.
- What did he say?
- You're right, Radar.
He's got a lot to learn about anatomy.
- Get Colonel Potter over here on the double.
- At this hour?
I can't do that.
- How'd you like a mouse in your milk?
- On the double.
- Halt!
- Aaah!
- Who goes there?
- It's me.
- Halt or I'll shoot.
- I can't get more halted.
Take it easy.
- What's going on?
- This bonehead was gonna shoot me.
Did you give the password?
He didn't ask.
You dumb kid.
Sorry, Margaret.
Don't let one mistake rattle you.
You'll get the hang of it.
-  - You just watch me.
Halt!
- Who goes there?
- It's me, Major Burns.
- What's the password?
- Ah, Caribbean.
I thought it was "Carib-eean".
It's the same thing, you simp.
- Advance and be recognized, sir!
- Blow it out your nose.
See?
- What?
- What?
- What is it?
- The artillery, sir.
- Artillery?
-  It's ours.
Colonel, it's disturbing the patients.
Captain Pierce says to tell you he requests you do something.
- And?
- That's it, sir.
- Yeah, all right.
Let's go.
- Would you like your helmet, sir?
We'll stop at the latrine.
Well?
He's still down.
He's not doing very well at all.
- Let's give him two more units.
- Yes, Doctor.
Major?
This is Colonel Potter.
Bird Colonel Sherman Potter.
Do you read me, Major?
Good!
Now can it or move it.
Got that, Major?
Good!
Oh.
Oh.
My gun went off.
I don't know how.
He's not gonna die, is he?
It's my first day.
- It's all right.
- Of course he's not gonna die.
- Sit down.
- The pain The pain - I forgive you, kid.
- I didn't mean it.
Honest.
- It's nothing.
Klinger, it's just a scratch.
- There it goes.
- My whole life is passing in front of me.
Ma!
Pa!
- Have we got the right shoulder?
- LaVerne.
Good-bye.
So long, Harry.
Frieda.
- Klinger!
- Paul.
Oh, I'm coming, Uncle Jake.
- Klinger, you're all right.
- Was the gun loaded?
- The lights are fading.
I'm too young.
No!
No!
- Could you at least bleed?
-  - What is the matter with you?
Oh, Klinger!
- He's molting.
How can I thank you for pulling me through, Doc?
I can't remember a tougher case, unless it was removing a kitten from my house slipper.
- I can't describe the agony.
- Uh-huh.
Shooting pains all down my arm.
My head is on fire.
I have no sense of touch.
I think I got what Bette Davis had in Mrs. Skeffington.
Don't move.
I'll get Claude Rains.
George Brent's not available.
Thanks for trying to cheer up my morale, sir.
Klinger, it's us.
You don't have to perform for me.
I will never surrender.
This is my ticket.
They gotta send me home.
I've done my bit.
I've been shackin' up with rats, eatin' swill on a shingle, and now my arm's half blown off.
- It's just a scratch.
- How do you know?
What about tetanus?
- Nah.
- It could've been of a rusty bullet.
- I'll give you a shot.
- No shots.
I'm allergic.
I blow up like a balloon.
I'll give you an anti-balloon shot.
- Lie down and rest.
- I'd rather do it in my own bed.
- All right.
Go back to your tent.
- My bed in Toledo.
If it was up to me, I'd stick a $1,000 stamp on your nose and put you in the next mailbag.
Your trouble is, there's nothing wrong with you.
If you could get really hurt or get killed, you'd be in great shape.
I ain't got that kind of luck.
Stay here where it's warm.
Why can't they ever have a war in Florida?
- Radar!
Those idiots are still shelling!
- Sir, they're still shelling us.
- Get that unit on the line.
- I'll call the artillery unit right away!
- Halt!
- Whoa!
- Who goes there?
- It's the colonel.
Oh, sorry.
Go ahead.
Don't you want to know the password?
I already know it, sir.
You're trembling, son.
You scared?
No, sir.
Just cold, sir.
If you had any brains, you'd be scared.
Colonel Clayburn?
Colonel Potter here.
One moment for the colonel, Colonel.
Colonel.
Colonel Potter here.
No, not the P.X. Colonel Potter.
Yes, I know him.
Just retired.
Shipped a temple home to open as a drive-in.
I run a MASH outfit.
4077.
Those big guns of yours are really rattlin' our bedpans.
I got some pretty sick boys in my hospital.
It's not doin' them much good either.
Well, thank you, Colonel Clayburn.
That's very good of you.
Potter.
P-O-double-T-E-R.
Jackass.
Don't touch me.
I told ya.
I'm not kidding.
Don't touch me.
You don't give the orders here.
- I hate your guts.
- My guts are not here for you to love.
- Funfair keeping you awake?
- He is.
What's the story?
He makes Dracula look like a teetotaler.
- How much more you given him?
- Three units.
Are you sure you closed everything?
I had him open for four hours.
I may be slow, but I'm thorough.
Maybe you just missed something.
Impossible.
I did everything but crawl inside him.
I can't think of what it is except maybe internal bleeding.
I plugged every hole.
- Then he sprung a new leak.
- He had 18 holes in his colon.
I got 'em all.
- You sure?
- 18 holes.
Exactly.
I thought, "What a place for a miniature golf course".
-  - Klinger!
Corporal Klinger!
Get in here.
Get in here immediately!
L - Get in here!
Do you hear me?
-  You are crazy!
You'll catch pneumonia.
- I want pneumonia.
Double pneumonia.
- Here.
Scarlet fever, the palsy, Halsey, the plague.
Anything!
He got shot by accident.
Terminal graze.
These beds are for real casualties.
I'd say Klinger's sanity is certainly a casualty.
Congratulations.
You may really be sick.
You get me well, I'll kill ya.
- Shut up!
- You shut up!
You both shut up!
Welcome to One Man's Family.
Damn colonels!
Can't trust any of'em.
Uh, General Morrison?
One moment.
Your call to General Morrison, sir.
One moment, sir.
Nate?
Sherm.
Sherman Potter.
Fine.
Fine.
How's Violet?
Oh, swell.
Who?
Oh, he's a very good man.
I'm sure he can help get the swelling down.
You could use one of her legs for an umbrella stand.
Nate, you gotta move those guns of yours.
They're putting me out of business.
Can't you send them down the road?
Thanks a million, Nate.
I knew you'd come through.
Send my love to Vi.
I'll say a prayer for her legs.
What?
Still, huh?
Try hotter water.
In your helmet.
Sit and soak in your helmet for a few days.
That should do it.
Thanks again, Nate.
Yeah, good-bye.
- Always go to the top, Radar.
- You're closer to it than me, sir.
That's the last unit of B-positive, Doctors.
- It'll never be enough.
- No.
I have to open him up again.
Right.
I'll start cross matching volunteers in the mess tent.
Wake those volunteers gently.
A simple rap on the soles.
Delightful waking people at 2:00 in the morning to milk 'em for a pint.
S.O.P., my dear Watson.
Hold it, Doc.
Don't wake anybody.
Not now, Klinger.
I'm B-positive.
Klinger, how would you like a medal?
Only for desertion.
- And go!
-    Oh!
Ooh.
I hope he gets stuck in his helmet.
- Take cover!
- Good luck.
- You okay, Klinger?
- Get off me, will ya?
I'll kill ya!
You're gonna kill yourself if you pull out those tubes!
- I don't care.
I wanna die.
-   Don't Watch your hands!
- Help me.
- I don't have to put up with any fresh stuff!
He's not gonna commit suicide and make a pass at the same time.
Well, I don't have to take any of that fresh stuff!
Get a sedative, will ya?
A glass of warm milk.
Anything.
Will you stop?
-  - Oh!
Don't Don't bite me.
- He's biting me.
-  Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Get the right rump.
Ow!
- Good shooting, Margaret.
- Thank you, Doctor.
I won't say a word to anybody about being in bed together.
Check those tubes.
You hear that?
I don't hear anything.
Know what that "anything" is?
Silence.
The shelling stopped.
It's all over.
Thank God.
You hungry?
year for beans.
That was good work, Doctor.
I think the kid's out of the woods.
Let me operate on a guy three or four times, I'm gonna get it right.
- Like us to see you home, Margaret?
- You don't have to.
What if someone knocks you down and takes advantage?
Let's get inside before we do.
Guess who didn't come home last night.
- Frank!
- Aaah!
- What are you doing?
- Huh?
- What are you doing?
- Uh Have you got a pencil?
- Have l - Well, I came in and, uh Uh, I was gonna leave you a note.
And, and, and I didn't have any pencil.
Note?
I looked in your nightstand.
You didn't have a pencil.
I found some paper.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Wow.
Sir.
Captain Hunnicutt, sir?
- Sir!
- Hmm?
Hmm?
- Klinger?
- Yes, sir.
Wish you'd shave your arms.
You got a phone call, sir, from the States.
Huh?
Oh.
- My wife?
- No, sir.
Captain Pierce's father.
- Pierce's father calling me?
- That's what he said, sir.
- Doesn't make sense.
- Want me to wake you when something makes sense?
- You'll sleep through the whole war.
- That'd be awful.
- Where's Radar?
- Colonel gave him a few days in Seoul.
He was flippin' out a little.
Started to put carbon paper in the latrines.
Hawkeye?
- Hawkeye.
- In In a minute.
- Phone call.
- Tell the warden it's too late.
They pulled the switch.
It's your father.
- My dad?
On the phone?
- Yeah.
Yes, sir.
- What time is it?
- 2:00.
- No, there.
What is it there now?
- It's 18 hours earlier.
I never know.
Either it's yesterday afternoon or a week from next Tuesday.
It's, uh, 8:00 last night.
He wouldn't call unless it was important.
My father!
A swarm of locusts in the bathroom would only rate a postcard.
Come on!
- Hmm?
Hmm?
- Sir.
Ooh!
You sure, Klinger?
Why would he want to talk to B. J.?
That's what he said, sir.
Honest.
Nobody but the captain.
Okay, Sparky.
We're ready.
- It's Mr. Pierce.
- Go ahead.
Tell him he's always been like a father to me, until now.
Hello?
Hello?
Mr. Pierce?
What?
I can't quite Hello?
Hello?
- Dad's not a very big talker.
- Hello!
He only spoke to Mom if there was an "R" in the month.
- Lost the connection.
- Mr. Pierce?
Hey, Sparky.
- Did he say anything?
- Anybody!
- All he said was, "How and why"?
-  Hey, world, where'd you go?
How and why?
Nobody.
They must've knocked out the lines.
Why don't we head Swamp-ward?
If your father wants to get through, he will.
I couldn't sleep now.
If I'm lucky, I'll get into the sack before Frank starts pledging allegiance in his sleep.
- Sorry, sir.
- Yeah.
- Klinger?
- Sir?
Did you ever hear of Crabapple Cove?
Was that in the hygiene lecture?
Crabapple Cove, Maine.
We have a summer cottage there.
It's heaven when the buttercups are in bloom.
And the goldenrod and the tamaracks are standing tall.
You could almost swear you'd died and gone No wonder Dad never calls me.
Hello, Dad?
Dad?
Ooh.
- Any word?
- Nah.
I'm gonna grab a quick shower.
- Come fetch me if you get through.
- In the shower?
Look for a white carnation.
Hey!
Hey!
I'm, uh, Lieutenant Detmuller of the, uh, Quartermaster Corps, Morgue Detail.
I'm here to pick up a body.
Who do I see?
I believe Corporal Klinger can assist you in this undertaking.
Not one straight man in the whole army.
- Are you Corporal Klinger?
- Yes, sir.
Hey!
Aren't you the guy who's trying to get out, pretending you're a woman?
No, no.
I'm the woman trying to get in, pretending I'm a guy.
Funny.
I'm looking for, uh, Pierce Benjamin Franklin.
Captain.
U.S. 19905 - 607.
- In the shower.
In the shower?
What's he doin' in the shower?
Who could tell with officers?
- Is this the whole tent?
- And nothing but the tent.
- I'm lookin' for, uh, Captain Pierce.
- You got him.
You can't be Pierce.
You mean, somebody pasted my face in this mirror?
Something's wrong, boy.
Really wrong.
Well, no war's perfect.
You're not dead.
Don't jump to conclusions.
I have a very good tailor.
You're supposed to be dead, sir.
Honest.
"Pierce, Benjamin Franklin.
Captain".
- This is a death certificate.
- Just a copy, sir.
They send the original back to the next of kin.
- Who would've been notified now by telegram.
- Army's very good about that.
No wonder my father didn't ask for me.
He thinks I'm dead.
So does the army, sir.
- If you're alive, I'm in big trouble.
- You're in trouble?
Three days ago, a body fell out of my bus onto the road.
Last week, I came up another two bodies short.
If I blow this one, they'll take me off morgue detail and put me on something worse.
What could be worse?
I don't let myself think about it.
Yeah.
Well, listen, Lieutenant, uh Detmuller.
Call me Digger.
I hate to inconvenience you, Digger.
I really do.
But I happen to be alive.
Born that way, you know.
- What time is it back home?
- Oh.
It's, uh Never mind.
I gotta make a phone call.
Sir, if I don't bring a body to the morgue they'll have my butt.
Better yours than mine.
This is a surgical hospital.
You must have some extra bodies.
Just one?
To spare?
We try very hard to avoid that situation.
Where's the best place to look for casualties?
Try the mess tent.
Hash eaters are your best bet.
My voluntary calisthenics program simply isn't panning out, Colonel.
- Isn't panning out, eh?
- I'd like permission to make it mandatory.
I've always felt people volunteer better by force.
Oh, exercise in the winter is very depressing, Major.
Although I must say the nurses' pushups are doing wonders for morale.
-  - I'm serious.
- So am I!
- But, sir Excuse me, Colonel.
I waited till Major Burns was talking so I wouldn't interrupt.
Pierce hasn't exercised once!
Hasn't done so much as a squat thrust!
I'm saving myself for marriage.
Far be it from me to tell you how to run your command, sir.
Very far be it.
But, uh, I, personally, myself think you should order goldbricks like Pierce to get out there.
I'm sorry I've missed your early-morning hernia farm but I, personally, myself, have been dead.
We're all a little tired, Hawkeye.
Not dead tired, Colonel.
Dead dead, as in doornail.
My corpus has been declared delicti.
There it is, folks.
My ticket to the last roundup.
My boarding pass for the Stygian Ferry.
Corporal!
Boy, they are pips.
- Sir.
- There's been some clerical error down the line.
Captain Pierce has been listed as dead.
- Oh.
That explains - The phone call.
Yeah.
They notified my father.
Get on the stick, Corporal.
Get word to his father.
Dig into the paperwork.
Let's clear this up.
On the double!
Yes, sir.
Sir, if it'll help, I'll take his place.
Just give me some sandwiches and drill a few holes in the coffin.
- Out.
!
- Yes, sir.
Can you believe it?
The morgue even sent the wagon for me.
- A little suction.
- Suction.
It's so unlike the army to make a mistake.
You'd think they'd have the routine down after the Seven Year War, the Hundred Year War - the War of the Roses.
- That the one they fought in Pasadena?
- Right.
- Purse string suture.
Purse string.
That Digger character gonna keep hanging around here?
He's trolling for a cadaver.
He gives me the creeps.
Well, it's his business.
He needs a body.
Speaking of which, what are you doing after the appendectomy?
Washing my hair, if I can get some beer.
I've got some beer in my tent.
Dead men tell no tales, you know.
- Bad news, Digger.
- Patient made it.
I'm sure you tried.
- Hey.
- What, hey?
We gotta have a wake.
What kind of friend would I be to let you pass away without a party?
- That's sick!
- No.
He's right.
I think I would've wanted it that way.
- As soon as I get off duty, I'll take care of everything.
- Put me down for half.
- No, no.
This wake's on me.
- What do you wear to a wake?
Captain!
I thought in lieu of you not being able to get through long distance you could send your father out a telegram through another unit.
You do that, Klinger, and you'll have free nose jobs the rest of your life.
Shoot.
"Dear Dad.
I am not dead.
Stop.
"Hope you are the same.
Stop.
"Thinking of selling my clubs?
Stop.
- "Spending my insurance money?
Stop.
- Poetry.
"Will call soonest.
Please don't worry".
Sign it, "Love.
Your nowhere-near-late son, Hawkeye".
Terrific.
I hate to think what my dad's going through.
Cheer up.
We're going to a funeral.
Attention all personnel.
Come one, come all to a wake for the late, great Captain Pierce.
We'll be mourning all afternoon and evening.
The deceased will deliver the eulogy and the guests will have 20 minutes for rebuttal.
Remains to be seen in the Swamp.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Gee.
He looks just like himself.
He actually looks more like himself than he ever has.
Let's keep 'em comin', boys and girls.
There you go.
Pass 'em over.
- What a good party.
I only wish I were here to see it.
- Mmm.
- I sure am gonna miss you.
- We all will, honey.
We all will.
- I understand you've been having a bad time lately, Lieutenant.
- Don't ask.
I'm donating my shoulder to the wheel my nose to the grindstone and my ear to the ground.
But I only have eyes for you.
I think you've got one more problem that you're probably not aware of.
- What's that, sir?
- Your buns are on fire.
Captain Pierce?
No cables going out, sir.
No phone, no nothing.
- There's a new security the strictest.
- I gotta get through to him!
On account of General Eisenhower's coming over, sir.
There's all kind of precaution the Secret Service, M.P.s. They're lockin' up a whole lot of South Koreans.
What for?
Cheering lessons?
# For he was a jolly good fellow #  #He was a jolly good fellow # # He was a jolly good fellow # # I was much too young to die ## I'm writing Peggy about your death.
Any messages?
No.
I'll add an R.I.P.S.
Later.
- Hey!
- Bottom of the morning to you, Frank.
I don't talk to goof-off corpses.
- What corpses do you talk to?
- Only those that lie at attention.
You've carried this death jazz far enough, Mr. Funnybones.
I haven't begun to die, Frank.
Being dead gets me out of orientation classes, O.D. Duty, inspection - And my body-building course?
I'm no dunce.
- Eh-eh.
I have no need to build on to my body, Frank.
I was born with just enough rooms.
Ah, go fish!
I told you to take off your dress before you come in here!
Not for you or any man alive!
Sorry, sir.
No soap.
The Red Cross won't help me?
What do they want, blood?
There's just no getting through.
Eisenhower.
What's he coming over here for anyway?
- Who needs a president with dysentery?
- Is that me?
One from Two from home!
Beaut These are from Major Burns's wife.
-  You can smell her disinfectant.
- Hey, Klinger.
!
Nothing for the bridesmaid?
They're stopping your mail in Seoul because you're You know.
Klinger, I need my mail.
I'm right in the middle of an obscene correspondence with a librarian - and we've just started the letter "C".
- I'll keep at it, sir.
All right.
And keep trying for my dad.
He's probably out of his mind thinking I'm now the former me.
Yes, sir, I know.
Crabapple Cove.
- Next.
- Hi, Frank.
- Name and serial number.
- Oh, come on, Frank.
We do this by the book or we don't do this at all.
Hunnicutt, B. J., Captain.
- You smudged my pay sheet.
- Sorry.
You're not sorry.
That was a vicious, deliberate smudge.
I'll go stand in a corner of Korea.
Next!
- Frank.
- Name and serial number.
Pierce, Benjamin Franklin, Captain.
Three.
I was one of the first in.
- Real cutie pie, aren't you?
- Well Pierce, huh?
Pierce, Pierce, Pierce, Pierce.
Don't you think accepting money somehow cheapens the war?
Come on, Frank.
Lay it on me.
- Sorry, fella.
You've been redlined.
- What?
- You're deceased.
You're off the payroll.
- That's not funny, Frank.
If you're too dead for calisthenics, you're too dead for pay.
Next!
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
I gotta have that money, Frank.
It's not like I can work someplace else.
There's not another army across the street looking for help.
- Next!
- Don't do this, Frank.
So, being dead isn't as much fun as you thought it'd be.
Huh?
Watch it, Frank.
They couldn't court-martial a dead man for breaking every smirk in your face.
Let me go!
- Let me go!
No!
Never!
Never!
- Gimme that money.
Gimme the money!
Give it to me, Frank, or I'll nail you to your boots!
Stop it.
You're hurting me in front of people.
Help!
Nobody's gonna help you, Frank.
They don't like you.
Right?
Right?
You're the ten most-hated men in this camp.
Help!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Please!
Stop it!
Stop!
- Gimme the money, Frank.
- I'm responsible for every penny!
Gimme the money or I'll give you - Oh, I hate carrots.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Here.
Punch him in the throat!
Punch him in the throat!
I will not take my death lying down, Frank!
I was finally able to get through to H.Q., Hawkeye and they were kind enough to send Captain Pratt here.
We've given your matter a good look-see, Pierce.
Excuse me, please.
What has happened is that some clerk down the line has obviously switched your name with that of a deceased patient on a Certificate of Death.
It happens all the time.
And has the real dead man's  Family been notified?
Uh, they will be.
In your case we'll submit to Quartermaster a request to rescind the Certificate of Death on form ten-stroke-249 in triplicate accompanied by an SF-88- stroke-11-0-7, signed by three officers of equal or higher rank followed by a personal written report on form 63-stroke-E-B-Y by a ranking officer who actually saw the deceased not die, uh, in triplicate.
- What does all this come to when you boil it down?
- That is boiled down.
This could take weeks-stroke-months!
- He could be dead by the time you make him alive.
- We'll do the best we can.
Meanwhile, no mail, no money and my own personal undertaker with his hearse double-parked.
Well, you are, Doctor, I am afraid what George Orwell described in 1984 as an "unperson".
An "unperson"?
Now I'm an "unperson".
Do you know that right now my poor father, not realizing I'm "undead," is at this minute mourning his "un-son"?
- I don't know any other way out of it.
- You don't, huh?
He just rattles around in that empty house, gives my things to the Salvation Army and ages a couple of years for every day he thinks I've shaken off this khaki coil!
- Well, I know another way out of it!
-  Where you going?
Excuse me, Colonel.
I'm late for an early grave.
You were a big help.
- What's happening?
- The war is over.
This death certificate's my ticket home.
If you're ever in Maine, look me up or rather down.
- I'll be under a stone marked "Pierce".
- Hey, Hawkeye.
Hawkeye.
- Hey, Digger, open up!
It's me.
- What do you want, Doc?
The final reward, please.
And step on it.
Let's go, Digger.
I'm not gettin' any older.
Where do I sit?
Nobody ever sits on this bus but me, Doc.
I can't take passengers, sir.
I'm not a passenger.
I'm cargo.
Casualties comin' in a mess of'em.
Could be any time now.
Thanks, Klinger.
- Hawk?
- Hmm?
- It's B. J. - I know.
Wish you could go with me, don't you?
You really goin' home?
Finally.
I've been fighting death since I came over here.
I'm tired of death.
I'm tired to death.
If you can't lick it, join it.
Right, boys?
You can't go, Hawk.
I have to.
The army says I'm dead.
I can't disobey.
I'm afraid you're going to have to.
Wounded.
Klinger says a lot.
I don't care.
I really don't.
They'll keep coming whether I'm here or not.
Trapper went home.
They're still coming.
Henry got killed and they're still coming.
Wherever they come from, they'll never run out.
- You serious?
- Dead serious.
Home, Digger.
Quit crying, Dad.
It's okay.
Really!
I needed a new set of clubs anyway.
Li No, I'm still dead as far as the army is concerned but they're working on it.
Listen, Dad.
Can I ask you a favor?
You think you could start sending me my allowance again?
Just for a little while.
I'll let you know how much.
What?
It's good to hear your voice too.
It's good to hear your voice too!
What else is new?
How's Orville's pitching?
You're kidding!
A no-hitter?
And everybody said Orville was all thumbs.
What else?
She did?
Well, tell her I said hello.
Dad?
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
- It's up to you, Father.
- The bet's two dollars.
I don't think I've got a prayer.
- Three Hail Mary's beats two of a kind, Father.
- I'm out.
Uh, I ain't got two dollars.
Youse guys accept a two-day pass?
Put it in.
Paper's paper.
We're certainly gonna miss you around here, Sergeant.
A lot of our hopes and cash will leave with you.
Yeah.
Well, I put in my time.
Thirty years' worth.
At least four of which were devoted to official army business.
- Are you in?
- Am I in?
- Yeah.
- With this hand, you wanna know if I'm in?
Are you crazy?
All right.
Here's your two dollars.
And two more.
And I get the last raise?
Mm-hmm.
Two, four six.
I'm out.
I must've been born under a ladder.
All right.
- What have you got?
- Full house kings and tens.
- Phew!
- Three eights.
Eight threes would've been better.
Hey, it's light out.
- Can I interest anyone in a Mass?
- Of what?
Well, another day in the R.O.K. - Have a safe flight home, Sergeant Kimble.
- Right.
With you out of the motor pool, maybe the army can finally break even.
You know, I think flight-homewise I got a little problem, Doc, with my ear.
I've got chronic adhesive otitis with eustachian tube dysfunction.
How do you know that?
A lucky guess and a little research.
- How long have you had this?
- I caught it the second I read about it.
- Your ears will hurt if you fly.
Right?
- Bad.
Like to get out of that little, tiny plane and into a big, big boat?
You know, you guys are too smart to be officers.
Kimble, the truth.
How much loot are you planning to ship home with you?
I figure a couple of thousand pounds.
- A ton?
- I didn't say that.
Right.
That's your word for 2,000 pounds.
And that's just personal effects and toilet articles.
Right?
I'm only taking enough to open a restaurant back in Philly.
"Kimble's Korean Kafe".
Three K's.
You get it?
You can buy your linen from the Ku Klux Klan.
- What about the two eyeholes?
- He can put the salt and pepper shakers on them.
All I'm asking is that you put in my medical file that I can't fly.
That requires three medical officers' signatures.
- You two are two.
- Last time we counted.
- Colonel Potter?
- The man's hopelessly honest.
- Major Burns.
- Major Major Burns do something thoughtful?
He sends his kids collect birthday cards.
- How long before you ship home?
- Two weeks.
But with my connections, I can get the orders changed.
We'll do what we can.
By the way MacArthur wants to know if he can have the car Saturday night.
Of course.
- Boy, that poker game really tapped me out, boy.
- Me too.
You couldn't lend me a few bucks, could you?
Against next month?
- I lent you against next month last month.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, this water sure does feel good.
- Yeah.
It's been gettin' too muggy for me lately, boy.
Even the weather stinks in the army.
I read somewhere that General MacArthur don't even sweat!
Can you imagine?
He just don't sweat at all.
Probably has some private do it for him.
- Boys.
- I'll be out in a minute, Father.
Take your time.
I took a bit of a bath in the poker game.
Huh!
Anyone heard they've spotted snipers near the camp?
- Pay no attention, Father.
Just rumors.
- It's just a rumor.
- Hmm.
Hey!
-  -  - That rumor almost came through the door!
I'll be out in a minute, Father.
Can you H.Q. Boys give me some help, Barney?
I've got sniper trouble.
-  - No, a British patrol will be fine.
Yes.
Right.
It'll give me a chance to use my English.
Thanks, Barney.
Everyone's a comedian.
See the men get plenty, Stokes.
We'll be about an hour.
Mind?
Lieutenant Chivers, - Hunnicutt, Captain.
- Pierce.
Ah.
I know a family named Pierce in Kent.
I've got an uncle in Suffolk.
Sheep farmer.
He's the one who never married.
My lads've been trying to clean up the area.
Snipers rather like giving you guys in medical a knocking about.
- Demoralizes the troops.
- Makes us feel a bit dreary as well.
Ah, it's a rotten war, all right.
Still, it's the only one we've got.
I say.
You wouldn't be doctors, would you?
Except for eight years of medical school, we wouldn't.
I, uh I have a small problem.
- We're very sensitive to small problems.
- The smaller, the better.
- Actually, it's hardly worth mentioning at all.
- Let's forget the whole thing.
No!
No.
What I mean is, you may not think so but it could be awfully dicey for me if this appeared on my service record.
Shall we repair to the clinic?
- I'd be most grateful.
- A privilege, sir.
I'm a lifelong Anglophile.
England is still the only place I know where any young man can grow up to be the queen.
What you must understand is that British C.O. S are absolutely bonkers on the subject of foot care.
An officer neglectful enough to develop an ingrown toenail is in serious trouble.
What can they do?
Make you turn in your feet?
Hold up a promotion, deny you leave, the lot.
Aha!
The offending digit.
So, in spite of all the training films and lectures you went and got yourself an ingrown toenail instead of saving yourself for marriage.
- Yes, I'm afraid so.
- Well, you came to the right place, Lieutenant.
- Yes, I've been told.
- Often these things are done in sleazy backrooms in Cuba.
- We're clean and safe.
You're aware of the price?
- Yes.
According to the Pierce-Hunnicutt Ingrown Toenail Clinic conversion table one severe metatarsal perionychium will cost you exactly two bottles of Scotch.
- Two bottles it is.
- Doctor, the hydrogen peroxide, please.
Lieutenant, you've put your foot in the right hands.
You'll be doing the Lambeth Walk in no time.
- Hey!
- Oh, for Pete's sake!
Somebody swiped our microscope.
That stinks.
Anybody who'd steal a hospital's microscope would take Tiny Tim's crutch.
Thievery's getting quite out ofhand.
Last week I lost two machine guns and a tea cozy.
- But a microscope!
- I might just be able to get us another one.
- Colonel Potter, Lieutenant Chivers.
- Sir!
- Ingrown toenail, eh?
- Pretty fast, Colonel.
It's my third war.
I've seen more British toes than I have American fannies.
- What's the going rate these days?
- Two bottles of Scotch.
- Good stuff?
- Jolly good stuff, sir.
It'll be welcome.
I had some local moonshine last night.
Curled the hair in my nose.
Hawkeye, I want you in post-op.
Tank Commander, 1 st Cav's here to visit one of his men.
You worked on him.
- Ah, the life of a star!
- Yak-eta, yak-eta.
- Ta-ta for now.
- Yes.
All right, Lieutenant.
Stick out your toe and saw "ah".
Your people are doing a big job here.
You know the wholesale business.
Over here.
Major Burns handles our most difficult cases.
Which is only fair.
He's our most difficult doctor.
You see that foot?
Ha-ha.
That's mine.
We had to take it out of his mouth.
Your man would be right here, Colonel.
You think the sun shines out of your bellybutton, don't you?
- I'm having it corked.
- Sergeant Moretti.
Glad to see you again, Moretti.
They taking good care of you?
No.
Excuse me, Colonel.
This is Private Mumford.
This is Sergeant Moretti.
- What?
- This is Sergeant Moretti.
Oh.
You get well now, boy.
Your buddies miss you.
I miss you.
The outfit's not the same without you.
He's out of the game, Colonel.
We had to use one of his ribs to give him a chin.
Pretty standard stuff.
Sometimes we use the jawbone of an ass.
Well, his tank is waiting whenever he's ready.
It must be very exciting riding around in one of those massive machines with that big cannon going through everything in front of you.
Major, if you'll walk this way.
If she could walk that way, she wouldn't need the talcum powder.
I gotta be shoving off myself.
Moretti, keep in touch.
Be sure to write.
Good-bye, Colonel.
Be sure to drive on both sides of the road.
Oh, Doc.
Doc, listen.
Uh As long as I'm here Sweetheart, you just say the word and you'll make me the happiest man in this camp.
Come on.
I'm serious.
Where Oh!
We were just rehearsing for the talent show.
Honest to God.
I told you we should've gone to my place.
As long as you're here, Colonel?
What?
Oh, oh.
Well, I, uh I got kind of this, uh, delicate problem.
And there would be, uh, certain ramifications if I, uh, if I were to check into a base hospital.
Say no more, Colonel.
We here at the 4077 are very social-minded particularly when it comes to disease.
I appreciate your coming to us instead of one of the local physicians whose medical training comes from watching Jean Hersholt deliver the Dionne quintuplets.
That's originally what I had in mind.
Yeah.
Odds are you'd have given him and he'd have shot a few cc's of Wildroot Cream Oil into your rump.
- Hair cream?
- That's right.
Doesn't cure you, but you wind up with the best-groomed tochis in town.
Yo!
- You got a minute?
- Always for you, Doc.
Come on in.
Wanna wet your whistle?
I got Scotch, vodka, bourbon, rye, sake.
Just pour it all in a doggy bottle.
I'll take it when I go.
- Sergeant Kimble, you wanna make a deal?
- Talk to me.
Pierce and I'll get you on a ship on one condition: You scrounge us a new microscope.
- What's wrong with the old one?
- Stolen.
- Stolen?
- Stolen.
These people are too much.
Do you know what I have to go through to steal it for us?
- No justice.
- Where am I gonna get another one?
They're tough.
As tough as carrying a Korean cafe home in two suitcases?
You got me by the eustachian tubes, ain't ya?
I hope so.
If I find another microscope you guarantee the boat?
I'll have the captain back it up to your tent.
- Ready, Colonel?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna leave this in a minute.
- Hey.
That was very smooth.
- Thank you.
Ooh!
Oh.
That penicillin smarts.
Not as much as Wildroot.
I feel like a damn fool.
It's a big club.
Okay.
Here's a list of dos and don'ts.
You've already done the biggest don't.
The rest is easy.
Now, you're sure this won't appear anywhere at all in your records?
Or my record either?
- Sure what won't appear?
- I don't know how to thank you, Doc.
Colonel, if I never see you with your pants down again that'll be thanks enough.
A very kind, affectionate act, your coming here to see your sergeant, sir.
Oh, thank you, Father.
Thank you.
Colonel's a very affectionate man.
It's what happens when the love bug bites.
If ever there's anything I can do for you, Doc -  - Get down!
-  - Ah, civilians!
Come on, Frank.
Throw something.
I don't want to throw something you need.
It's a new hand.
I need everything.
Well  Gin.
- But you said you didn't need anything!
- I lied.
I lied.
What'd I catch you with?
- You're certainly a savage at cards, Margaret.
- Oh.
- Sixty-eight!
- And 25 for going gin.
And, uh, we were in spades.
That's double.
I'm out in all three games.
You owe me one pair of nylons for each.
Only if you let me play shoe salesman.
You're a little savage too.
Aren't you?
You, uh, really found that tank commander attractive, didn't you?
- I wouldn't say that.
- Don't toy with me, Margaret.
- I'll bite your T-shirt to ribbons.
-  -  Frank?
-  You in there?
- They're trying to catch us at something.
- We're not doing anything.
Oh, yeah.
Who'd have thought?
- Come in.
- Interrupting?
Not at all.
I know I'm in here, but I'm not doing anything.
We'd like you to sign this.
Uh, I examined Sergeant Kimble last month.
There's nothing wrong with him, except a possible hernia from mailing truck transmissions.
Yeah.
But if we fake his profile, he'll get us a microscope.
Fake?
Huh.
Include me out!
What about the next wounded kid that comes in that needs a blood count?
I'm sick of hearing about the wounded.
What about the thousands of wonderful guys fighting this war without any of the credit or the glory that always goes with those lucky few who just happen to get shot?
- I think you've finally gone out of your skull.
- No.
Wait a min No.
A microscope would be useful.
You could use it to examine your I. Q - or your feelings, or your tiny little heart.
- Hawkeye.
- Out!
That's it!
Out!
- You heard him.
Out!
Out!
You know, you're beautiful when he's angry.
Antagonizing Frank didn't help at all.
I've had to put up with him longer than you.
- You're supposed to be smarter than he is.
- A houseplant is smarter.
I've had more intelligent conversations with people I was doing autopsies on.
- Tact wouldn't have hurt.
- A lot he cares about a microscope!
Doctor Burns!
He'd prescribe a laxative for a brain tumor.
Things are looking up.
-  That Chivers?
- The charge of the Scotch brigade.
- Doctors.
- How's the, uh, small problem?
- Splendid.
- You do understand that your toe should have nothing to do with any other toes for at least a month.
Yes, Doctor.
Also, no liquor for the toe, and don't wear any spicy socks.
On the subject of the former I believe this covers your services.
Like a Scotch mist.
My thanks again, sirs.
- Mention this to your friends.
- Our business is largely word of foot.
Tallyho.
-  -  - This isn't happening!
-  It feels like it's happening.
Attention.
!
Sniper activity in the compound.
!
- It's murder out there.
- Attention, all personnel.
Inside's your best bet.
Ahh!
One down.
Ahh!
They were only eight years old both of them!
- Ooh.
Ooh.
- At ease, son.
At ease.
Thank you, sir.
Maybe later.
- About the sniping - We're doing all we can.
I'm working at my desk and Radar's scared.
- And that's all?
- I can work twice as hard, if you like.
- Radar, can you be twice as scared?
- No problem, sir.
- C-Colonel, will you - Look at this.
Come here.
- What is that?
-  Two bottles of toenail juice.
The Scotch!
Eight-year-old Scotch!
Ah, well.
The good die young.
-  -  You know what would scare 'em away?
- Cavalry.
Today's cavalry.
A tank.
- Let's not shoot off any cannon!
No.
Nothing like that.
Just the sight of a tank would do it.
It's like having a big dog in your front yard.
Works every time.
Radar, that Colonel Griswald was here from 1 st Cav.
Get him on the horn.
- Right.
- Why him?
I showed him a few cc's of kindness.
- He had a slight case of carnal flu.
- Off the record, of course.
- Seemed like a decent duck.
- Loved by one and all, especially off base.
He's comin' on.
- Radar, you're a model of efficiency.
- I built him out of a kit.
- Hello!
Hello!
-  Yeah.
Can you speak up a little?
Somebody's trying to kill me.
Colonel Griswald?
Yes, sir.
Hold on, please.
Just a moment, sir.
Hello, Colonel?
Captain Pierce, your friend in need.
Remember?
Colonel, I have a little problem here that might interest you.
We're getting a lot of sniper fire and  I beg your pardon?
- You're very busy right now?
-  Terrific.
!
Colonel, the above sniper fire is endangering all my private medical records.
All of them.
I may have to put them in the official files for safekeeping where anyone and his uncle can get a very good look at them.
Yes, sir!
Monster, isn't it?
Good ol' American know-how and insanity.
Can't tell you how grateful we are, Colonel.
This tank'll give us a lot of security.
We tried a night-light, but it didn't work.
- What's the blessing for a tank, Father?
- "Thank God" will cover it.
This bucket of bolts happens to be going in for maintenance.
I can let you have it for 24 hours.
- Terrific, Colonel.
I'm sorry about the bad news.
- What bad news?
Your medical records were destroyed in the last attack.
- Burned to a cinder.
- Ohh.
Well, I guess you can keep it for a week.
That'll be long enough to scare the North Koreans and both Chinas out of here.
Thank you, Colonel.
How 'bout a belt for the road?
No, no.
I can't do any drinking for quite a while.
We're cleaning up an old tank driver's complaint bloodshot hips.
What?
- Make it 50 cents.
- Call.
- Just once.
- I'm in.
Uh, and up 50.
- Anything beats just one ace, Radar.
- The bet's a dollar.
- Call.
- Right.
- In.
- I'm light.
- Go.
This is the way to run a war.
For the last 24 hours the only frightening sound has been Frank's mouth-breathing.
No luck on the signature yet.
Right?
We'll get it, if we have to resort to torture.
We're making a bid on an anthill later.
Go ahead.
- Frank, you didn't!
- Did too!
- At Fort Benning.
I trained in one for a week.
- You never told me.
Ah.
They said it was a shame I was a doctor.
They felt I had the same killer instinct as Patton.
- Oh!
You're just funning me.
- Oh, yeah?
Oh, Frank!
Should you?
Ha!
Think just those hotshot colonels can handle these babies.
Huh?
Stand back, puddin'.
Ah, Frank.
Do you think you should?
Cinch-a-reeno!
- Oh, Frank.
!
Oh.
!
You're It's starting up.
-  Stand back, Margaret.
Now, be careful, Frank.
Just Frank, do you know what you're doing?
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Uh, I'm gonna get out of the way, Frank.
- Boom.
- Frank?
Frank.
!
Oh, my Frank, it's a Frank!
Do you see me?
Frank!
Are you in control?
You're going the wrong way!
It's the girls' showers!
Oh!
Girls!
Out!
Frank!
-  -  How do you stop this thing?
Frank.
!
Oh, my Frank!
It's Major Burns!
Help him!
Frank!
Colonel, save us!
No sweat.
Watch an old cavalryman in action.
Oh, no, no.
Colonel.
Colonel.
Colonel Potter.
!
Stop!
Pull over!
Burns!
Don't leave it there.
!
No.
!
No.
!
Don't leave it there.
!
Let him have it.
!
Terrific, Frank.
Especially when you did that figure eight over Colonel Potter.
Burns, you got any excuse for that jackass behavior?
I'm sure he has, Colonel.
Somehow the tank got started, and it went crazy.
Frank jumped in.
-  Saved us all.
- Somebody had to.
Uh-huh.
- What?
- Sign on the bottom line, Frank.
- Sergeant Kimble's medical profile.
- Yeah.
That's blackmail.
- Huh?
- Blackmail's an ugly word.
We prefer "extortion".
- B-U-R-N-S, Frank.
- B-U-R Yeah.
There you go.
Very good.
-  Thank you, Frank.
- Oh, yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Penny for your thoughts, Frank.
- For God's sake, why?
- It looked important.
His forehead's all puckered up.
So are all my inwards.
Radar, I don't remember this road being this terrible.
There's nothing the matter with the road, Pierce.
You're just feeling punk.
Me?
I'm in fine fettle.
I never felt "fettler".
You're telling me you're not hung over?
Oh, that's what it is!
I thought somebody painted a base coat of fuzz on my tongue.
Well, don't think I didn't see how much you drank at the medical conference.
- You were disgusting.
- How about me, Frank?
- You weren't so bad.
- Really?
I was trying to be disgusting too.
-  - Holy cow.
!
Easy, Radar.
My head's coming off at the dotted line.
Just an excuse for boozing your brains out.
Well, I, for one, discussed medicine.
I heard you.
Accusing a French gynecologist of not taking his work seriously.
- Aha.
-  We home yet?
- Torn-up road, Colonel.
- We're in Con Edison country.
You all right, Radar?
I'm fine, sir.
But I think the bus is gonna have kittens.
Where are we?
Been wanting to talk to you about that, sir.
Where we are mostly at the moment is lost.
- I think I better pull over.
- Pull over, Radar.
We can't be lost!
We are, Frank.
I've been lost before, and this is exactly what it looks like.
- Anybody got a compass?
- I got a neat one in San Francisco.
What are you doing?
The breeze is coming from that direction.
Thank you.
Now all we have to do is trade the bus for an airplane.
- Colonel.
- Yeah, Radar.
- We may not be lost.
- How so?
I think I remember that tree.
Radar, that tree has the same face as every other tree.
- Your marbles are shifting.
- I say we go on.
I say we go back.
Each officer will go a hundred yards in a different direction.
See if we can find any signs of village life or other roads.
- A hundred yards.
No more.
- A hundred yards?
- In these woods?
- Take one of the enlisted men with you, Major.
- See anything, Corporal?
- Just the bus, sir.
We know what's there.
It's there we're worried about.
I like that there there a whole lot better, sir.
Corporal, take the point.
- Hey!
Why me?
- Oh, you present less of a target.
Anyway, they love to pick off officers.
We're the cream of our generation.
I'm sort of the cream of my family, sir.
Besides, I can cover you better from the rear.
Oh, my rear would feel a whole lot safer if you were in front of it, sir!
- All right.
Move out, soldier.
Move.
- Oh, boy.
-  O'Reilly?
- Up ahead, sir.
There's something going on behind that tree.
I'm goin' on behind that tree, sir.
Corporal!
Would you say we've gone a hundred yards?
For my money we have.
Yes, sir.
- Let's go back.
- I'll take the point.
- Any luck?
- Just woods and more woods.
I met a little girl with a basket for her grandma.
- Wearing a red riding hood?
- Actually, she was with seven dwarfs.
- She's in the wrong woods.
- Or the wrong story.
- Are you finished, Doctors?
- You?
Yeah.
- Burns?
- Uh, sighted nothing, reporting same.
A simple "crapped out" will be sufficient, Major.
- Yes, sir.
- If we don't know where we're goin' we do know where we've been.
My decision is to turn this animal around, head back where we were get new directions, start out all over again.
Mount up, people.
- This your first trip?
- Oh, shut your gizzard!
- Just a joke, Frank.
- Pierce!
Uh Do me a favor.
We're all in this together.
I know you don't like me.
That's an ugly rumor started by someone who heard me say I don't like you.
Well, till we're back safe, no jokes, okay?
- Right.
- Thanks.
Now, that's a handshake for you.
Strong and wet.
Wait a minute.
Don't move.
I'm hungry.
Lost and hungry.
I remember the act.
They sure served some good chow at the society meeting.
The steaks were great.
- Steaks!
Frank, you ate the steaks?
- First one I've had in a year.
You realize they served them right after the autopsy.
You said no more jokes.
- Who's joking?
- My lamb chop had a wedding ring on it.
- What's wrong, Radar?
- I don't know, sir.
She won't start.
- Got plenty of gas?
- Got plenty of gas.
I think we might have busted something on that last big bump.
Oh, swell.
We can't go forward, and we can't go back.
It's a sign from heaven.
The war is over.
- Now what?
- We burn our uniforms, go home get married and breed a new batch of draftees for the next one.
- Hear, hear.
- Let's finish this one first, shall we?
Well, there's something wrong here, sir.
Sir, there's something really wrong here.
At least if it was a horse, we could shoot it.
- Fine leadership.
- What would you do?
If this unit were still my command, you'd soon find out.
I spent a week with you in command, Frank.
You lost me when you rigged the toilet seats to rise to attention.
Only for inspection.
What are you beating your gums about, Major?
Colonel, I don't think you appreciate the true nature of our situation uh, gravity-wise speaking.
Unless I'm mistaken, we're lost, we can't move we've got no food or water, no blankets, no communications, night is falling.
We may be right now in enemy territory an enemy that would think nothing of giving us bamboo manicures right up to our knuckles followed by boiling egg-drop colonics.
Does that sound like the proper appreciation, Major?
- Pretty much, sir.
- Thank you.
Gimme that!
You get in the driver's seat.
When I tell you, turn her over.
- Roger?
- Roger, wilco, sir.
You know anything about engines, Major?
Oh, I took a lot of shop in high school.
I wouldn't take shop from anyone.
- You planning to fix it or buy it, Frank?
- Oh, hardy-har.
This is all getting more than a little uncomfortable.
- Spooky-wise speaking.
- Turn her over.
-  -  Are you crazy?
- I did what you said!
- That's the last thing he needs.
- I did what you said!
- That's the last thing he needs.
Gimme that, Frank.
I'm against capital punishment.
Well, I've done all I can do.
It's now in the hands of the Almighty.
Speaking for myself, that's not the worst news I've heard today.
- Colonel, look what I found.
- A walkie-talkie!
Only thing is, the other one's back at the camp, and it's busted.
Any Allied personnel, this is Major Frank Burns, MASH 4077.
S.O.S. And Mayday.
Come in, any Allied personnel.
Major, there have to be two of those things.
Someone else has to have the other one, and he has to be on your frequency.
- It's no fun alone, Frank.
- What is?
Any Allied personnel.
Can you read me?
I'll give you my location.
Major, the other end of that gizmo is on the fritz and 20 miles from here!
It only carries half a mile when it does work!
Any Allied personnel.
Here is my position.
There is a fighter plane approaching and when I say "now," the jet will be directly over my head.
-  - Now!
Frank.
That thing's a thousand feet up and going 500 miles an hour.
By the time you said "now," the plane was in its hangar - and the pilot was in his jammies.
- I was just trying to help!
Stop trying.
That should help right off.
- Nothing like a little appreciation.
- It's busted.
- Radar.
- Yo?
- Try it one more time.
- Yes, sir.
I've been in worse spots.
Ever tried getting dressed quietly in a dark closet with a pocketful of change?
-  -   No soap, sir.
World War I, Argonne Forest.
Lost and hungry then too.
Couldn't find my outfit.
After three days, I was ready to eat my socks.
Nothing to do but wait.
- At least everything turned out all right.
- Right.
I was taken prisoner.
They shaved my head and beat me to a pulp.
I think I'm getting delirious.
I'm just having warm, friendly thoughts about the gourmet leftovers at the 4077 chow line.
Listen, we'll be okay.
- Course we will.
- You betcha.
I'm not scared.
Any Allied personnel, if you receive me, here is my position.
Ready?
Uh there are only about half a dozen stars visible, sky-wise.
I am directly under the brightest one.
- Over.
- Terrific, Frank.
They'll start searching for us in Bethlehem.
Shh.
Hey, listen.
What, did you hear something out there?
No.
No, I guess not, sir.
- It's probablyjust an animal.
-  Hope it's one of ours.
- Radar's radar's jammed.
- If it wasn't, would we be here?
Oh, sure, Pierce.
Blame it all on O'Reilly.
You just go back to being Tom Swift and his electric paranoid.
Okay?
It's nobody's fault.
You know that.
- I know.
- Of course it isn't.
I know.
Hey, this is no way to throw a party.
How about some stories before we rejoin the ladies?
Now you're cookin'.
What kind of stories?
The first time love conquered all.
- Ah.
- Colonel Potter?
- It was back in World War I. - In the Argonne Forest.
After Chateau-Thierry, actually.
I took a load of gas that blinded me temporarily.
Spent over a month in a French hospital with my eyes bandaged.
Nurse's name was Colette.
Colette.
The darkness I lived in was relieved only by the sound of her voice touch of her hand.
Then finally the day came for the bandages to come off.
When they undid the last of them, there she was.
Colette.
- And?
- I pretended I was still blind.
And that was your first romance?
Yeah, but I couldn't have handled it without the bandages.
Radar, you're next.
Huh?
Oh, uh Listen.
Would you guys come back to me please?
I gotta go to the latrine.
You'll have to take a hammer and nails and build one.
I'll manage.
No wonder the trees all look familiar to him.
- Frank?
- I was just lying here!
Come on.
Join the party.
Give us your story.
-  Be a sport for once.
- Well.
Uh, it was, uh, during my sophomore year.
She was a little brunette of Jewish persuasion.
I wonder who persuaded her to be that.
Helen Rappaport.
Smart as a whip.
- They've all got rhythm, you know.
-  Right!
Anyhoo, we were on opposite sides of the class debate.
"Should Father Coughlin be our next president"?
She talked very fast and won.
Then, I think to make it up to me, she offered to drive me home.
On the way she pulled this old gag about running out of gas.
Never fooled me, boy.
She was really warm for my form.
- And did you oblige?
- I couldn't.
- Creep.
- I wanted to save myself for Miss Right.
- Miss Right?
- Orville and Wilbur's sister.
She invented the first airplane stewardess.
I'm referring to the present Mrs. Burns neither which of us approved of that sort ofhappiness before marriage.
Okay.
Hawk, you're up.
Yeah, in a second.
Radar?
Radar!
- I'm gonna go look for him.
-  No, sir.
- B. J.'ll come with me.
- Sure.
- With the two of us, we'll be fine.
- And leave me alone with Burns?
He's more boring asleep than awake.
He's asleep now.
Probably dreaming about home.
How rich he's gonna get taking out healthy gall bladders.
Hawkeye, we're none of us going wandering around out there.
Unacceptable procedure.
Also stupid.
I won't have it.
We can't look for him till it gets light out.
- Easy, Burns!
- Put that thing away.
Cochise is gone.
We formed the bus into a circle.
- Is he back yet?
- No, not yet.
- No, huh?
- "No, huh".
That's right, huh.
Be a shame if something happened to him.
Burns, go back to sleep.
That's an order.
What did I do?
Look, I liked Radar too!
You talk about Radar in the past tense one more time and I'm gonna show you how to be a tail gunner!
Steady, guys, huh?
I think it's agreed we all like him.
Except whoever wrote me anonymously that Radar was selling tickets to the hole in the nurses' shower.
- Well, it wasn't me!
- Why would I think it was you?
Because I know people think that's just the kind of thing I might do.
- Well, why did you do it?
- Because I felt it was my duty.
I thought you said you didn't do it.
I thought I did too.
-  - Shh!
There's something out there!
- Will you stick that in your holster?
- Is it Radar?
- I wish I was home.
- I wish you was home too, Frank.
Hey!
He's attacking!
He wants us to surrender!
Either that or he's asking if this bus goes downtown.
-  - Ha.
He's surrendering to us!
Good thing for him.
I can plug an ace of hearts at 50 feet.
- I'll remember that if we're attacked by a bridge club.
- Let's go!
All right, fella.
All right.
You're okay now.
- He's got a gash in his leg.
- I'll break out the kit.
I wouldn't touch him.
He's probably booby trapped!
Could go off in our faces!
Burns, don't start going on about going off.
Let's get him inside.
You may be right, Frank.
I think what he's done is he's cut a gash in his leg, inserted a grenade and disguised it with his own blood.
Boy, are they clever.
How's that?
Better?
Better.
I been here all this time, I still can't speak the language.
Well, you Americans figure everybody understands English provided you speak it slowly enough.
- Huh?
- Right.
- Burns.
- Sir?
Didn't I see your picture in the post office?
- I wonder if he saw Radar out there.
- That's right.
You could be giving aid to someone who killed one of our own boys.
I don't mean Radar.
I'm sure he's alive.
I mean, reasonably sure.
Frank!
You keep putting your foot in your mouth, you're gonna end up with athlete's tongue.
Okay, that does it.
Send a bill to the People's Republic.
It's time we got some shuteye.
Who wants to stand guard over the prisoner first?
- He does.
- He will.
- I do.
Fine.
If you don't accidentally shoot yourself first I'll relieve you in two hours if you do, I'll relieve you earlier.
That's it.
Let's get some kip.
One wrong move, and it's curtains.
Get the message, Mr. Moto?
Yeah, I thought so.
You know plenty English.
Okay, friend.
I'm not a talkin' man.
Next time I talk, this talks for me.
No questions asked.
Curtains.
You get the message, pal o' mine?
I don't chew my cabbage twice.
One wrong move, and you'll find that out.
I act.
Zing!
That's the big kiss-off.
Capisce?
I tend to, uh, shoot first and talk later.
Little habit I have.
Which you'll find out fast if you get cute.
We straight on that?
Huh?
Any Allied personnel.
Any Allied personnel.
I've begun to take prisoners.
Request instructions re prisoners or will be forced to shoot same.
Over and out.
Think you get the picture.
Right, amigo?
Sir?
Sir.
Sir?
Holy socks!
- O'Reilly?
- Sir, I didn't mean to wake you!
Wake me?
You think I was asleep?
No.
I was just trying to see what our prisoner'd do.
- I flushed him out of the woods.
- Let me help you with the chocolate.
- That's not chocolate!
- Right.
It's not chocolate.
What's goin'on?
Not one word about my sleeping trick.
It's against the Geneva Convention.
- Right, the Geneva Convention.
- It's Corporal O'Reilly, sir.
He's back!
-  Radar?
- I'm back.
Hello, sir.
Hell of a time to go AWOL, son.
We kept your bus seat just the way you left it!
- Good to see you back!
- We were worried about you!
-  - Oh, my gosh!
- Thank you, I think.
- Thank you.
Fine.
Fine.
Thank you.
You lie down.
- B. J., relieve Major Burns at guard.
- Right.
You come and tell us where you were playin' hooky!
Oh, my gosh.
You'll be sorry.
He's wily.
So in the dead of night you decide to go off half-cocked and get help.
Well, gee, sir, since I got us lost and I broke the bus I figured I didn't need your half-cocked permission.
Anyway, the point is that, uh, when I was wandering around there I didn't find no enemy, so I figure we're safe as long as we can get outta here.
Speaking of which, enemy-wise, has anybody seen our prisoner?
There he is!
Sabotage.
!
He's tinkering with our parts.
!
- Get away from there!
Gimme that!
- Easy, Frank!
Easy!
- He's wounded, remember?
- Oh, wounded, sure!
That's how we lost China!
By fixing a bus?
Careful, that could be loaded.
All right!
All right!
That settles it.
We've finally run out of food, water and brains.
We gotta get outta here, which means walking.
So, we walk.
-  Wish I knew how to say thanks.
- Holy cow!
We're mighty grateful for this, old man.
-  Get outta my seat, Pierce.
- Oh, shut your gob, Frank.
Nick of time.
I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse.
May the 1 st Cavalry forgive me.
I think in the future we should always stash something to eat on this bus.
- Make a note of that, Radar.
- Yes, sir.
Like one of us could just fill a ditty bag full of chocolate bars and stuff.
'Cause when you're really hungry you could fall asleep when you're not supposed to.
- Right, Major?
- He-e-ey!
Wait a minute!
I just remembered.
Now, maybe maybe Wait.
Oh!
Ha!
Lookee here!
What luck, huh?
Colonel?
And, uh, Corporal?
You guys?
- Thanks, Frank.
- Thank you, Frank.
- And, uh, this is mine.
-  Home, Radar.
Hey.
Look.
No.
- Sir!
-  I think I've got the enemy.
- I can hear their secrets!
- But you don't understand the language.
If you people had any brains, you'd give up.
You hear me?
No one ever beat Uncle Sam!
We've never lost a war!
- Major - We never have, and we never will!
So you put that in your opium pipe and smoke it!
- That's tellin' 'em, Major.
- Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
##  Does the colonel wish to dictate a letter?
No.
I was going to write one to my wife.
Our anniversary's coming up shortly.
- Oh.
Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.
Are you married, Radar?
No, sir.
I'm just a kid.
When you get back home, you ought to find yourself a nice girl.
First I wanna get a '46 Chevy.
- I've had 27 wonderful years with Mrs. Potter.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Can't get that kind of mileage out of a Chevy.
I never ride the clutch, sir.
Finish the daily report?
- Yes, I did, sir.
- Notify the officer of the day?
Done.
I've done and did everything you told me to done and do, sir.
Relax, Radar.
Smoke if you've got 'em.
I'm just a kid, sir.
Would you like to clean up the office?
Oh, yes, sir.
That would be nice.
That's I did That's one of my best things.
"My dearest Mildred" "My dearest Mildred.
Well, one more year has rolled around "and we are facing another anniversary away from each other.
"Thanks for the talcum powder.
Took a long walk yesterday and didn't chafe a lick.
"Tickled to hear you got your corn removed.
"Wish I were there to dance with you.
"As for me, I'm still trying to get used to this outfit.
"It's not easy.
I'm the new kid on the block "and they've all got their own little ways.
"Like my company clerk, a young boy they call Radar.
"Nice enough, but a little squirrelly.
"Of course, he's been over here a long time.
"As your cousin Natalie said, and she's been quoted by so many - 'War is hell".
' -  -  Someone's at the door, dear.
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel.
- Major.
Major.
- Colonel.
- What can I do you for?
- With With your permission, we'd like to take your picture.
- For the unit yearbook, sir.
- I didn't know you had a yearbook.
- Oh, yes.
We've had one every year.
- Starting with this one.
What kind of pose would you like?
- Um, standing.
- Sitting.
- Standing would be better, Major.
- Not sitting?
Standing is very difficult to do when you're sitting.
Why don't I stand?
Uh, uh - An F-4 and a hundredth.
-  Yes, yes.
Sir, I think it would be better with a 2.8 and a 1/25th.
Keep your exposures to yourself!
Hold it!
Now a side view.
No, you stay, sir.
He'll move.
Move!
Protection.
Protection, yes.
Neat.
- Thank you, Colonel.
Thank you very much.
- No sweat, I'm sure.
Major.
Colonel.
Curious, aren't they?
Just about each other.
Sir, I'm all finished now unless you've got some more dirt I don't know about.
That's all.
Were my shirts delivered by that laundry woman?
She's a little slow, sir.
Her ox is sick.
Oh, sorry to hear that.
Sirs!
Um, I was just wondering.
Would you mind taking a picture of me with your camera?
Neither a borrower nor a lender be.
Good morning, Radar.
Uh, good morning, Father.
I was just testing the wind direction.
Ah, it's north.
- How 'bout a date after chow?
They ran out of poodle.
- What would we do?
We could go to the generator shed and watch the valves go up and down.
- Captain, can I talk to you, sir?
- Just a second, lad.
- There's bird-watching.
- At night?
- Bat watching?
- It's not important, sir.
- Meet me in the Swamp, Radar.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- Why don't we just go to your tent?
- Uh-uh.
What's the matter?
You live with your folks?
##  ##  - You know how to knock, soldier?
- Sure, sir.
Just traipsing in.
Suppose I'd been engaged in some top-secret, hush-hush, confidential activity, huh?
I peeked first to see if Major Houlihan was here, sir.
You little fink!
- Who's a little fink?
- I am, sir.
You may think it's all right to give enlisted men free run of our quarters.
- I disapprove.
- I told him to meet me.
Well, who do you think you are?
Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce, surgeon, U.S. Army involuntary.
- Your hand is filthy.
- I was leaning against a dusty nurse.
For a change.
- Where you goin', Frank?
- That's for me to know and you to find out.
Witty dog.
- I'm probably responsible for his leaving.
- Come in more often.
What's up, Radar?
It's Colonel Potter.
Gee, I just can't get relaxed around him.
It's like staying with your aunt instead of your mother.
You gotta say "please".
You can't dunk your zwieback in your Bosco.
You're not used to him yet, Radar.
Give him time.
Oh, no, no, no!
I spent 15 summers with my aunt.
Always came home with "hyperaciditity".
Old Henry Blake was like his father.
Oh, yeah.
Taught me everything about life and everything.
Even women.
- I know.
- I can't wait to get home and try it out.
Give Potter a chance, Radar.
He's okay.
No, no, it's not the same!
It's my aunt all over again.
- Chopper.
-  Incoming chopper.
No wounded.
Repeat.
No wounded.
Just mail for a few luckies.
- Here you go, Corporal.
- Thank you, sir.
I wanna check the tail rotor cables, and then y'all got a sharpshooter around here?
We've got four rifles in this outfit.
And one of them's a reading lamp.
We got a wounded horse up north.
Left there by the Chinese.
I wanna put the critter out of its misery.
Hey, wait a minute!
You just gonna shoot it?
- I think he's pretty badly hurt.
- Well, you can't do that.
- The animal's probably suffering.
- That doesn't mean you have to kill it.
It's got rights.
- What else can I do?
- These sirs are doctors, sir.
Maybe they can save it.
Come on.
I'll go with ya.
Would youse, huh?
Please?
Pretty please?
- You get the feeling we're in a Lassie movie?
- Please?
- All right, okay.
Will you help us?
- Sure.
"Sorry I had to leave you for a minute, Mildred dear.
"I walked over from my office to the mess tent for a cup of joe.
"Can't say much for the coffee here.
But if I run out of ink, I'm covered.
Ha, ha".
- Colonel?
- Padre.
Little coffee break?
Yes, sir.
I've been hearing confessions all morning.
It gets me right in through here.
- Enjoyed the sermon Sunday.
- Oh, yes.
"Do Unto Thy Brother".
You know, you can't miss if you've got good material.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I have to run.
- More confessions?
- Dysentery.
Ah, well, this too shall pass.
"Excuse me, Mildred.
That was Father Mulcahy.
"You'd like him.
Very dedicated, fine young priest.
"Every once in a while, he'll surprise the puttees off ya.
The other night, we were watching a movie".
- Three-to-one.
I'll take the Indians.
- That's a bet.
Five bucks.
- What's the name of this picture?
- Custer's Last Stand.
- You're ruinin' my picture!
-  -  -  Lights.
!
- Can you fix it, Corporal?
- I think so, sir.
- Don't you have another picture?
- Just one.
A training film.
Fungus of the Feet.
- Starring Fred Astaire.
- How long will it take, Corporal?
- A few minutes, sir.
-  Patience is its own reward, folks.
Perhaps, with your permission, Lieutenant O'Connor and I can give you a little preview of a number we've been rehearsing for the orphans' show.
- Hear, hear!
- Lieutenant.
Come, my child.
##  #When you're all dressed up and no place to go # # Life seems weary dreary and slow # #My heart has ached and bled # #For the tears I've shed # #When I've no place to go unless I went back to bed # # I've had a sad, sad life and whenever I go # # To that peaceful spot # #Where the violets grow # # Upon a nice white stone # #Will be written below # # He was all dressed up and no place to go ##  Can you see him, Dan?
He's about a mile west of your position.
You're gonna have to get off the road.
- Dan, any unfriendlies around?
- Good question.
Negative.
- This is crazy!
- As opposed to just being in Korea?
Turn right at that tree, and you'll see him about 2:00.
-  Wait!
- Perfect, Dan.
Good spotting!
We're fine from here.
This is good.
Stop.
Not too close.
You know anything about horses?
- I stepped in manure once.
- You're in charge.
Oh!
Ooh!
Look at him!
Wow, he's beautiful!
- I just hope it's not two Chinese in a horse suit.
- Let's get him and get out.
Wait a minute.
Maybe we should talk to him first.
Radar, if he's got anything to say, he'll tell you in the truck.
Easy.
Easy.
Don't scare him.
He might hurt himself.
- Did you ever lasso anything?
- My little sister.
Owed me a nickel.
Hawkeye, get over there and draw his attention away from me.
You got it, Tex.
Careful.
Don't hurt him.
Throw it.
He's giving me the eye.
Gimme that rope.
- It's still my turn.
- Come on.
Come on.
What you gotta do is make him think you're just headin' for the bunkhouse for a cup of coffee.
He knows you're not goin' to the bunkhouse.
Would you sirs mind just holding still for just a minute?
Okay?
Easy, boy.
Easy, boy.
I'm not gonna hurt ya.
Attaboy.
Look what I got here.
- My name is Radar.
Radar O'Reilly.
-  Yeah, you're a nice horse, aren't ya?
Would you like to take a ride in a nice big truck?
I'll sit right beside you all the way.
Here.
Come on.
Attaboy.
Come on.
If I could only do that with nurses.
"Just got back from Rosie's Bar, dear.
"A civilian joint across the road.
Picked up a few beers.
"Ran into Majors Burns and Houlihan.
"She's the head nurse.
He's the head twerp.
"He's married, but I think something's going on between 'em.
"Course, it's none of my business.
"Sometimes he has lip rouge around his mouth and his lips are all swollen.
"But like I say, that's none of my affair.
"Seen her a few times with whisker burns on her cheeks.
"But that's of no interest to me.
"He did come into O.R. The other morning with teeth marks on his neck.
"Doesn't prove anything, though.
He could've been roughhousing with the camp dog.
"But you know how I am, Mildred.
What folks do on their off-duty hours is no business of mine".
Ahh.
!
Anniversary.
I understand.
Many happy returns.
I have just what the major needs.
William Holden.
No.
No, no.
It isn't his anniversary.
It's the colonel's.
And we want to get him something special.
Oh.
Yeah.
One doorstop, two dollars.
Two bookends, a special, four dollars.
- If you'll just shut up, we'll tell you what we want.
- Okay, Joe.
One of our sergeants said you do wood carving.
Oh!
Sergeant Kowalski.
I made a naked lady radiator cap for his father's Chrysler.
Now we're getting somewhere.
You do carve.
I show you.
Used to be round.
- Looks like a two-by-four.
- Thank you.
Look at these.
That's Colonel Potter.
Front view.
- Side view.
- Two views.
- Check.
- No checks.
Strictly cash.
No.
The major will pay in cash.
We would like a bust carved of Colonel Potter.
- I thought you were gonna pay half.
- All right!
Can you carve a bust?
- Wood or stone?
- Wood.
Hmm.
Lotsa work.
Two assistants.
Electric light at night.
Overtime.
Hmm.
Six bucks.
- Well - Frank.
These people have no "espect-ray" unless you "aggle-hay" over the "ice-pray".
- Five dollars.
- Seven-fifty.
Sold.
"Umb-day"!
You just take it easy, pal.
This isn't gonna hurt, not a bit.
These guys are terrific doctors.
Don't build him up too much, Radar.
This is my first horse-ectomy.
- Didn't you guys' own pets ever get sick?
- Only pet I had was a stuffed owl.
- A very true and loyal bird.
- Give 'em a little cotton, and they're yours for life.
-  - Don't you listen.
They're just kidding.
- Ready, Doctor?
- As ready as I'll ever be.
-  - Easy!
Nice, nice fellow.
Good.
Good.
Easy, pal.
They're just gonna swab your behind in the back.
That's all.
How bad is it?
-  - From point of entry, it looks like one piece of shrapnel.
He'll be fine.
You can bet him to win, place and live.
- Got anything to calm him down?
- I'm trying to give him a sedative.
You got anything to calm me down?
Will you hold on to him?
- I am holding him!
-  - Radar.
- Easy, boy, easy, easy.
- Watch it, watch it, watch it!
- Radar!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
You're in business for yourself, Radar!
- Did he kick you?
- No.
He just missed the lavalier.
- He's all calmed down now.
- Forget it.
He's crazy.
- He's crazy.
- What?
He's only human.
Anyway, the sedative worked.
His eyes are all glazed over.
- That's not the end we're worried about.
- But he needs you!
- No.
Radar - Oh, please?
- No, no.
- Come on.
He needs you.
Please?
Attention.
A bulletin from the truce talks at Panmunjom.
After six weeks of negotiation, the U.N. And North Korea have agreed that flagpoles in the peace compound are to be 32 feet, 61/4 inches high.
World leaders hail this agreement as an important step toward lasting peace.
Radar, the longer you keep him, the more attached you're gonna get.
- Maybe some farmer down in the village can take him.
- Are you kidding?
Have him pull some heavy wagon full of rocks and junk?
I'm keeping him.
-  I don't think you can.
- Colonel Blake let me keep pets.
He let me keep Black Beauty.
- Black Beauty was a hamster.
- Potter's not Blake.
- He'll never even know.
- The man's ex-cavalry.
If he spots four flies having a meeting, he knows they're talking about a horse.
I'm not giving him up.
Look at his eyes.
He loves me.
You don't even know his name, background, family.
There's a difference in your ages.
Spit on the tips, Frank.
Where is that wood carver?
He promised to deliver the bust this morning.
I told you not to pay in advance.
I told you to pay half when we ordered it, and half on delivery.
I didn't know.
My wife usually handles these dumb things.
Frank, you mention that person's name in this tent once more and you'll never spit on my boots again.
Sorry, Margaret.
-  - Cho Man Chin.
- Hello, lady and man.
- It's about time!
- You like rope around box?
- Yes, yes, it's fine.
Gift wrapped.
I did a first-class job.
- How do I look?
- You have a little dandruff.
- That's none of your business.
- I'm also a hairdresser.
You don't have any dandruff, Margaret.
You got rid of most of it.
- Where are you going?
- I hate to miss the big moment.
- You've been paid.
Push off!
- Please.
An artist's life has so few rewards.
Frank, I go on duty in ten minutes.
- What's in the box, Frank?
- None of your beeswax.
A present for the colonel's anniversary.
We should've gotten him something.
Watches.
Ballpoint pens.
Look at this.
Very valuable.
Hitler's pencil box.
"And so, Mildred dear, I come to the end of this long letter.
"Sorry we can't be together on our anniversary "but my heart is always with you.
Your ever loving Sherm".
-  - Come in.
Happy anniversary, Colonel!
- Well!
This is indeed a surprise!
- B. J. And I didn't know, Colonel.
- Yeah.
We'd have gotten you something.
- World Series ring?
- You really shouldn't have done this.
- Oh, it's nothing.
This is from me and Major Burns.
They had nothing to do with it.
- Can't figure what this is.
- May I, sir?
The moment of truth.
- Remember the day we took your picture, sir?
Well - Voila!
- Hey, I like that.
!
- Hey, that's nice!
It doesn't look like the colonel.
- It looks like you.
- It gives the colonel a little class.
Well, I'm overwhelmed.
I think it's a dandy likeness.
-  - Come.
Ah, sir?
I have a present for your anniversary.
This is turning into a real party!
- Can I bring it in, sir?
- Please.
Wish Mother were here to enjoy all this.
Oh my!
It's a horse, sir.
Here's the keys.
A beautiful horse.
I don't know what to say, Radar.
I want my money back.
In American, and not that stuff I paid you.
Shh.
He can't be more than four years old.
- Pretty nice, Radar.
- At least I'll get to take care of him.
- This calls for a drink.
- At least.
-  Sorry about that, sir.
- That's disgusting!
Son, to me, that's a tiptoe through the tulips.
Good boy.
Attention, all personnel.
Incoming wounded.
Both shifts to O.R. On the double.
Incoming wounded.
Let's get 'em, boys and girls!
Let's get 'em!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Give me another clamp.
Mmm.
Golden, golden.
Ah, 17 straight hours of surgery.
- Anybody seen my back?
- I could sleep for a week.
You promised to do my toenails.
Tickalock.
Does he really do her toenails?
His father was a world famous manicurist.
Son of a gun.
You're always full of comebacks.
Thank you.
I want an hourly report on that arterial transplant patient.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Colonel Potter?
- Colonel, we just got a radio message from Nurse Cratty.
- What's a "Nurse Cratty"?
Meg Cratty.
Runs a civilian orphanage about 30 miles north of here.
Uh, sir, she said they're being shelled, and they've got to evacuate.
Good Lord.
All those children.
Happened last year too.
They bunked with us.
Some of the kids are sick, and she's got a pregnant woman that's gonna have a baby.
Oh, no!
Are we gonna have to go through that again?
They steal!
- Burns, shut your face.
- Last year they took a roll of my best toilet paper.
They just wanted to look at the pictures.
Let's get cuttin'.
Major, break out the extra cots, blankets, pillows, whatever we need.
Yes, sir.
Corporal, I'll need a detail.
All right, everybody.
We're getting company from the orphanage.
I need the mattresses.
Klinger, put that down.
I need you.
- You just said pick it up!
- We need supplies.
Mattresses, cots, blankets, extra pillows.
- Towels.
- Get those mattresses outta here.
- Put those two cots in Colonel Potter's tent.
- Those in Colonel Potter's tent.
- Put these two cots in Major Burns's tent.
- Major Burns's tent.
- Put these two in my tent.
- Those two in her tent.
Are you gonna stand there clowning around, or are you gonna help me?
Major, I guess you haven't noticed!
This is not a house dress.
- Go get in your fatigues.
- Fatigues?
In the evening?
- Move it!
- Is she beautiful?
- Margaret.
!
- Put that in my tent.
I have to get this done, Frank.
Come here.
Come here.
- What is it?
- I want to show you something.
- Not here!
- No, this came in a box when we were working.
Okay, keep it moving.
Keep it moving.
- It's a Purple Heart.
- Yeah!
- Who's it for?
- Me, silly!
You?
How?
When?
When were you wounded?
Last month when those two snipers infiltrated.
- You never told me.
-  Well I know.
You didn't want to worry me.
Yeah.
Well, when have I ever asked for sympathy?
Hmm?
- Resisting the pain.
- Yeah.
Holding it back.
Keeping that tiny little chin firm.
Laugh, clown, laugh.
-  - Oh, I'm sorry.
- Wanna get that side?
- Yeah.
I got it.
I'll do this.
Why don't you start the other one?
Ah, shame you decided to become a doctor.
You'd have made a great chambermaid.
I've done both in my time.
Worked in a resort hotel to help my way through pre-med.
Ten dollars a week and all the pride I could swallow.
Oh, caramba.
!
Don't tell me we're having two foreigners sleeping in here.
Frank, this is their country.
We're the ones from out of town.
Oh.
Always attacking us and defending them.
If you like it so much why don't you live here?
I do live here, Frank.
You ought to see a proctologist about possible brain damage.
- What's that you're wearing, Frank?
- Just my citation.
Citation, Gracie?
- That's a Purple Heart.
- Yeah.
It's a Purple Heart.
- You were never wounded.
- I most certainly was!
- When?
- During the sniper attack.
A month ago.
I got a shell fragment in my eye.
Hold the phone, Central!
I'm the one who treated that eye.
That was an eggshell fragment.
Nevertheless, it was the result of combat and it's on my service record as "shell fragment".
You were breaking open a boiled egg and got nervous.
- Those are for kids who really get shot up.
- I could have lost my eye!
Oh, yeah.
There are hundreds of cases of losing an eye from a three-minute egg!
- Give it back, Frank.
- Not on your Nellie!
Frank, you don't get medals for other people's blood.
She's here, sirs.
Nurse Cratty.
- They're here.
- Come on.
Sir?
Uh, Major?
I know!
I'm not "deef"!
- Okay.
Hiya, Meg.
- Would you believe they're bombin' us again?
War is no fun if you don't bomb orphans.
This is Dr. Hunnicutt.
Trapper John's gone Stateside.
- My sympathies to both of ya.
- Thanks.
- Well, Colonel.
- You look terrific.
Well, of course I do.
I just came from the beauty parlor.
- Is this your whole bunch?
- All except that little mother-to-be.
We dropped her down the road to visit her in-laws.
She'll be along.
Hi.
I remember you.
- Well, Father.
- Lovely.
I just washed.
Mama san, Mama san.
- Mama san.
- She thinks I'm a woman.
Never dreaming I gave you jockey shorts for Mother's Day.
Okay.
Open your mouth.
I hope you like this.
Some of it was cooked before you were born.
Right this way.
You got a little passenger here.
I'll take him from you.
Come on.
- Eyes clear.
- Got two bits, Joe?
My name is Major Burns, not Joe.
And I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, Jasper.
- Next.
- Frank, give the poor child a quarter.
- No!
- Frank, stick a crowbar in your wallet and give it to him!
- Here.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- Match you double or nothing, Joe?
- See?
- Well, you don't have to play with him.
I'm gonna teach him a lesson.
All right.
- Thanks.
- Next!
- Little cheat.
- Oh, Frank, how did he cheat?
Oh, they have their ways.
How'd he lose his leg?
Oh, they pick up shells to sell for brass.
Once in a while they get a live one.
Oh, God.
All right.
You've already had your inoculation.
Four bits?
Double or nothing?
- Am-scray!
-  - We wanna hear a story.
- Honest, I don't know any story.
You tell a story.
You gotta practice for your little girl.
I could tell them about "Jack and the Beanstalk," but I have a fear of heights.
Freud says that has something to do with sex.
My wife's only 5'1 ".
- Story.
- Story.
Okay, okay.
Once there was an army doctor a bad, bad major.
What did he do?
He pretended he deserved something that only certain soldiers can have.
He accepted a medal that he wasn't entitled to.
If you think I don't know who you're talking about, you're a dumb Dora.
Okay, okay.
I'll give it a try.
- Once upon a time - You're a natural.
A long, long time ago, there lived a young man named Androcles.
Now, Androcles was a very kind, very gentle young man.
One day he was taking a walk in the wilds and he came upon a great big ferocious-looking lion.
"Well, that's it," thought Androcles.
"He's gonna have me for lunch".
But instead of eating him, the lion held out his paw to show him that there was a great big thorn stuck right in his paw.
Now, Androcles realized that he could run away because the lion was in so much pain, he couldn't chase him.
But instead, you know what he did?
Androcles very gently removed that thorn from the lion's paw and the lion was so happy, hejust walked right away.
Androcles thought no more about that lion for years until one day he was arrested by some guys called the Romans who wanted to punish him for his faith.
You see, Androcles was not only very kind, he was also very Gentile.
And, uh, these Roman guys, they threw him into an arena and let out to tear him to pieces a gigantic, ferocious lion.
Well, sir They're asleep.
- Yeah, so?
- So what?
So what happened to Androcles and the lion?
You know what happened.
You're not gonna finish?
I think your senility's here ahead of schedule.
Okay, okay.
Just for that, I'm not gonna tell you the version where the papa bear comes home alone.
-  -  Yo?
- Hi, Meg.
- Hi, guys.
- You got any tea left in this kettle?
- Comin' up.
-  - Kids all bedded down?
Mm-hmm.
I'm a little worried about Sung Lee though.
That's my expectant mother.
She should be here by now.
- Bubble gum?
- Mm-hmm.
Want some?
Uh-uh.
But please don't blow any bubbles.
It scares the kids.
They think your stomach's comin' out.
You know, that stuff's a lot better than it used to be.
- It's our aging process.
- We let it sit a full 20 minutes now.
You sure you want more of this story?
You really don't understand.
You want more?
You do want more.
Okay.
Here we go.
"Field stripping, cleaning and routine maintenance of Garand rifles.
Section 22!
Repeated disassembly and assembly causes excessive wear of parts and will eventually reduce the accuracy of the weapon.
See Figure 57".
Oh!
Pictures and everything.
"To disassemble piece into above groups place butt against left thigh, sights to the left.
With thumb and forefinger of right hand, pull downward and outward on rear of trigger guard.
Swing trigger guard out as far as it will go and remove trigger housing assembly".
And so they lived happily ever after.
Assembly.
- Halt!
-  - Sorry.
Sorry.
- It's okay.
- Going to latrine?
- Yeah.
Both of us.
Mention my name.
Take good care of her.
-  - What's that?
- Nurse Cratty.
Nurse Cratty!
- Hey.
!
Oh, my God!
That's the pregnant girl.
She's been shot!
- Medic!
Medic!
- Hey!
Hey, medic!
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Somebody!
## Shh.
You've got to stop, honey.
Sack time.
You were terrific.
You can play in the morning.
Hey, you're real good.
I betcha you know "Chopsticks," huh?
There you are.
Nice and warm.
- Mama san.
- No.
No mama san.
Corporal Klinger.
- Mama san.
- G.I. Joe.
Look.
See?
No McGuffies.
Everybody sleep.
She took a bullet through the lower abdomen.
Blood pressure's 80 over 40.
-  - Baby's heartbeat's audible.
- It's 90.
- We've gotta get in there and see what's bleeding and then do a Caesarian section, otherwise we'll lose them both.
- Doctor?
- Only thing to do.
Pump in some more plasma, and let's get some whole blood.
- I've already sent for it.
- Prep her, Major.
- Midline incision.
Stem to stern.
- Yes, Doctor.
Anybody done a Caesarian lately?
- Damned arthritis is eating up my knuckles.
- Hawkeye?
I haven't delivered a kid since I drove my nephew over to his grandmother's.
- That's close enough.
- What are the heart rates?
- Maternal, 140.
- Baby's 75.
B. J.'s fresh out of residency.
- Just a kidney stone's throw away.
- It's up to you, B. J. - Right.
- You deal.
We'll kibitz.
- Patient's ready, Doctor.
- Fine, Major.
Shall we make a baby?
Attention, all surgical staff.
Heavy night patrol action.
Stand by for incoming wounded.
- Wounded.
4:30 a.m. - Terrific.
You could set your watch by this war.
Corporal.
Did you see a Slicky Boy come through here?
- Sir, you'll wake her.
- I saw that little thief hanging around officers' country.
- Something missing from your tent, Major?
- Oh, it's only a matter of time.
Stealing isn't even considered a crime in this godforsaken country!
It's because they're poor, Major.
They have to steal to survive.
Well, there's no reason for being poor!
If they had any gumption, they'd be out looking for a job instead of always scrounging around in our garbage cans for food.
Yes, sir.
Where are the rest of the children?
- Can you see that bleeder?
- I think so.
Looks like the uterine artery.
Clamp.
- Sponge that, Margaret.
- Sponge.
Send his X rays to his draft board in case they like horror pictures.
- Let's get some of this blood off the floor.
- Corpsman.
- What's wrong with wall-to-wall blood, Colonel?
- Steady, Hawkeye.
- Clamp.
- I'll give you more retraction.
I'll clamp the uterine off, and try not to get the ureter.
Then I'll go after the baby.
Her blood pressure's dropping, Doctor.
70 over 30.
More blood.
Pump it in.
Close this for me, Margaret.
I've got Fresh gloves!
Something in a blue suede.
Hawkeye, take a look at this.
- Better do a nephrectomy.
- Gimme a retractor.
- May I be of any help?
- Everybody has, Father.
Might as well bring in the chairman of the board.
-  - Clamp.
Oh, stop behaving like a child.
- Retract a little more.
- What's the story, B. J.?
- Bleeding's controlled.
- Terrific.
- I'm going after the baby.
Classical section.
- Kellye?
Pressure's barely holding.
- Those rotten snipers.
- It's their job to be rotten.
The bullet came awfully close to the baby.
Cross your fingers.
Good luck, B. J. Here we are.
See the place I fixed up for you?
Oh.
What a big girl.
There.
Now listen.
Don't worry.
They're not gonna move you from in here.
You gonna go back to sleep, huh?
Gonna try?
# Bye-lo, baby # # Bye-lo, baby # # Bye-lo, baby # # Bye-lo, baby, bye # # Daddy still loves you # # Daddy still loves you # # Daddy still loves you # #Though he's gone to war ## - Colonel, I'd like to talk to you.
- Get on a table.
- Has that Slicky Boy been in here?
- Scrub.
We need your hands.
Heaven only knows what he's filched around here.
All these people are such a bunch of crooks!
That one down there is smuggling bullets in her abdomen.
- Oh, funny.
- Father, will you help Major Burns scrub up?
- Yes, Colonel.
- Now just a minute!
You give these people an inch, and they'll take a mile!
- Father, you're hurting my arm.
- Come, my son.
- Hey!
- Let me help you scrub, Major!
What are you doing?
Priests aren't supposed to hurt people!
I did a bit of boxing before I joined the Jesuits.
I was a featherweight.
They wanted me in Willie Pep's stable.
That feels nice, Father.
- These are tough times for all of us, you know, Frank.
- Nice and soapy.
How's she doin', Father?
The Korean girl.
Poor little thing.
She's having a very difficult time of it.
-  - Hey, a baby!
It's okay!
Another soul among the living.
Now, my friends, may I suggest we all bow our heads in silent prayer for the mother.
Klinger, I thought you were an atheist?
I gave it up for Lent.
- How's the mother?
- She's weak, but she's gonna be just fine.
Oh, great.
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- If the pictures were right in school, it's a boy.
- Gee.
- Bullet went through the mother's abdomen.
He's got a nick in his little butt.
- Wow.
- He's gonna be all right though.
- Nurse Cratty?
- Hmm?
I got something I'd like to give the mother.
It's a bed jacket that's too small for me.
It's quilted, aquamarine with off-white brocade.
And right here there are violet sequins arranged in a stunning fleur-de-lis.
I gotta get him that discharge.
Now, just one minute, Margaret!
Now I won't even have time for coffee.
I'm due in post-op.
It's just that I'll feel safer if I have it with me.
- How do you live with them?
-   That's terrible!
Sacrilege.
- What is it?
- It's a picture of General MacArthur in the nude!
- It's gone.
- What?
- My Purple Heart.
Stolen!
- Oh, Frank.
I knew it!
They're all crooks!
- We should give this country back to the Indians!
- Wait.
Frank.
Frank!
Stop him.
!
Stop him.
!
Don't lie to me!
Where is it?
No.
Maybe some other boy.
We all look the same to you.
I saw you hanging around my quarters.
Now where is it?
I warn you.
I've had two judo lessons.
- Knock it off, Frank.
- You let him get away!
- He swiped something of mine!
- No, he didn't.
How do you know?
You don't even know what I'm talking about!
- That makes two of us.
Come on.
- What?
As commanding officer of MASH 4077 and as authorized by the president of the United States, Harry S. Truman I hereby award this Purple Heart medal for wounds received in line of duty - to the child of, uh - Sung Lee.
Right.
And it's a privilege to honor the little guy.
Where did you get this?
- I bet I know.
- Bite your tongue, Margaret.
Or better yet, let me do it.
-  -  - That's my medal.
!
- You can get another one, Frank.
They're staying up nights making Purple Hearts.
- Well, I really would like one.
- Well, with any luck at all Hawkeye, it was a nice thing you did.
- It sure was.
- Well, he deserved it.
It's lousy to get shot on your birthday.
- Thanks a lot, Colonel.
- Anytime, Meg.
-  - You ought to deliver babies more often.
I'm afraid I'm in the wrong neighborhood.
- Mama san.
!
- Yeah, okay.
Mama san.
Klinger.
Hawkeye, if I was 40 years younger.
- I thought you were.
-  - Thanks a lot, Father.
- Nurse Cratty.
- Oh, and thanks for all your good help, Major.
- Oh, thank you.
Now sit down flat on the bottom.
Where you goin', Radar?
Hey, come on.
Come on.
Okay?
-  -   Bye!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Attention, all personnel.
Incoming wounded in the compound.
First surgical team, report to the bus.
First surgical team.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Gangway.
Hot stuff comin'through!
Dennis, give us a hand.
Keep track of the blankets.
- Margaret, prep him, and hang another unit of plasma.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Same here, Major.
I want chest X rays.
- These two in pre-op right away.
- Kellye, gimme a hand.
- Who lost a rabbit's foot?
- Looks like they all did.
- Why don't you finish triage.
I'm gonna go and scrub up.
- Right.
- Think you'd better start with that one there first.
Okay?
- Okay.
- All right, you can walk.
Watch it.
Watch it.
- Watch it.
Stand up easy.
Klinger!
- Sir?
Get him into X ray.
Watch your head.
Tell Major Burns he's invited to surgery.
Captain, what what's your name, please?
Right.
- Well, come on.
Snap it up!
- Sorry, sir.
- I haven't got all day.
- Doing a little moonlighting, Frank?
He's got another malpractice on the side.
- Big load come in?
- Three waiting, Father.
- I'll get into some gear.
- Don't stand next to Frank, Father.
- He'll cut right through your beads.
- You're as funny as a crutch.
- Sir?
- How many times have I told you to knock?
- Sir, look at this.
- Picking an easy one, Frank?
- Ha, ha.
- That the captain who was on the bus?
- Yeah.
- Terrific.
You really made my day, Radar.
Better look sharp, Father.
We got a friend of yours in surgery.
Huh?
Well, what'd he mean by that, Radar?
Father, we got a guy that says he's Jesus Christ.
Some people just don't belong in combat.
I'm trying to love it, Frank.
Honest, I am.
- Well, what about the fellow's dog tags?
- He didn't have any.
I asked him what his name was, and he said, "I'm Jesus Christ".
Just like that.
Not even Captain Christ.
My word.
You know what really irks me about this war, Beej?
No idea.
The lack of genuine spontaneity.
Every day it's the same old grind.
You wake up, brush your teeth, walk the dog, operate on the Lord.
Oh, that's downright blasphemous!
That's from a man who polishes his socks for inspection.
- Pay him no mind, Major.
He envies you your sanity.
- True, Frank.
Next to your lisp, that's what I envy most about you.
Boy, you really are a sicko.
Mental.
Just 'cause I spend most of my waking hours fixing up small wounds so they can go back and get bigger and better wounds, you think I'm mental?
Ausgespielt?
Bughouse?
Teched?
Milky in the filbert?
Of course I am.
Wouldn't you be, Lieutenant Nightingale?
It goes against my training to say take two aspirin and go get yourself killed.
What would Hippocrates say?
What would Socrates say?
And what would you say if I asked you to go into the linen closet for heavy breathing?
- Are you gonna knock it off?
- That's what I'm trying to find out, Frank.
Disgusting!
Oh, Lord.
Sorry, I wasn't talking to you.
- Lieutenant.
- Doctor.
- She's crazy about me.
- She hides it well.
- We don't want anybody to know.
- Good work.
What is it you find so fascinating about ladies in olive drab?
Mother was frightened by a recruiting poster.
- What are you up to, you swarthy minx?
- Bedpan duty.
- Good training.
- After the war, you can open your own pay toilet.
Keep it up, Doc.
With my luck, you'll get my Section Eight.
- Good morning, sir.
-  - How you doin'?
- Fine.
How are you?
- Oh, fine.
- Oh, uh, we're doctors.
Apparently you lost your dog tags, so, uh we have to get some information from you for our records.
You know the army the old green machine.
Yeah.
We need your rank, your serial number, your, uh, unit - Your name.
- Yeah.
That'd be a good place to start.
- My name.
-  Mm-hmm.
My name is Jesus Christ.
Oh, that's funny.
We have a savior by that name.
Ah.
A little witticism that was just condemned to purgatory.
Uh, no foolin'.
We need a name.
Of course.
Jesus Christ.
J-E-S-U - We've got that.
- Uh, that much we know.
Yeah.
Uh Your head wound is very superficial.
It's It's hardly more than a scratch.
If you wanna have a go at bugging out of the army, that's fine.
I just think you should use a fresher approach.
What can I do to convince you?
A miracle would definitely be a step in the right direction.
Maybe a few steps.
Say, upon the water.
Doctors.
Padre.
You two ought to get acquainted.
Better acquainted, he means.
Uh, Father Mulcahy, Jesus Christ.
- Hello, my son.
- Hello, Father.
Well Here we are.
Just what do you intend doing about it, Colonel Potter?
It's an outrage.
Something has to be done about this person calling himself Christ!
- Why?
- Why?
- Did you say "Why"?
- It wasn't him.
It must've been me.
Oh, come off it, Major.
Who's this fella hurting?
- He should be court-martialed for cowardice!
- And blasphemy!
- And blasphemy and cowardice.
- And cowardice!
The effrontery of the man!
A mere captain claiming to be him.
But I don't see how that pertains.
If a man says he's Christ he might just become a better Christian.
I mean, if I had a horse who was convinced he was Man O' War I don't know that I'd want to set him straight if you get my drift.
Colonel, we're speaking of our savior.
- We want to be sure - That certain parties Don't help that yellow-backed hoodwink the U.S. Army - in which I, for one, so proudly serve!
- We so.
- You're referring to - Pierce and Hunnicutt.
- Is who he's referring to.
Oh, you've hated them since they stuck a turtle in your shorts.
Well, this has nothing to do with that.
What is it you think they're planning to do?
Well, who knows?
All these bleeding-heart liberals are the same!
Let a man claim to be an underdog and they will do anything they can for him.
You regard Jesus Christ as an underdog?
- Well, he didn't exactly run roughshod over the Greeks.
- Romans.
Or them either.
I'm telling you, those two hotshots will do anything they can to give the red, white and blue a black eye.
Horse hockey.
Pardon my French.
As long as I'm in charge around here which will be another seventeen months, two weeks, six days there will be no shenanigans.
I do not approve of carrying tales.
Evidence is one thing.
Innuendo is another!
If evidence is what you want, Colonel, evidence is what you'll get.
Are you with me, Major?
- Right up to the hilt.
- Sir.
Creeps.
- I'm sure glad you could make it on such short notice, sir.
- We certainly are.
You call this short?
I've been outside the camp for over an hour - waiting for the cloak of darkness.
- Gee.
Just like The Shadow.
You're some guy, Colonel Flagg.
Yes, I am.
It's not necessary for me to tell you we appreciate your contacting us.
We're not in the gratitude business.
It's the duty of every real American to be on the lookout for goldbricks, pinkos and fellow travelers.
Of course, without the likes of Americans like you the jobs of Americans like me would be a lot more difficult.
But don't get me wrong, Americans like me like difficult jobs.
So don't get the idea you're doing the C.I.A. Any favors.
We don't really need Americans like you.
We don't need anybody.
- You said it!
- What do you make of this mystery man who claims to be Christ, Colonel?
Just your typical Joe trying to get out of doing his duty?
I bet commie.
I say his parents weren't even born in this country.
- Korea?
- No, I meant our country.
You know.
America.
Hmm.
Well, you can put a lid on this guessing game.
As it happens, I know who our friend with the messiah complex really is.
Oh, I knew you'd get to the bottom of this.
All it takes is the right man with a shovel who knows where to dig.
- I couldn't ask for a better man.
- Or a bigger shovel.
Uh, sir.
Here's orange juice.
Thank you.
I brought you two.
Thank you.
I'll be grateful to you, Colonel, if you can clear this matter up.
Without taking hostages, if possible.
Colonel Flagg's over here to keep us all safe from democracy.
- Can it, Pierce.
- Still a cutie pie, ain't ya.
Well, some guys have got it.
Colonel, I've got your man's complete dossier right here.
Name's Chandler, Arnold T. He's a bombardier with the 428th Bomber Squadron.
His plane was shot down four days ago, at which time he received his alleged wounds.
I told you they were alleged wounds.
That's why I gave him all that alleged plasma.
You're lucky I got a sense of humor.
Well, what sort of military record does this Chandler have?
- It's inconsequential.
- How many missions did he fly?
- Fifty-seven.
- Sounds consequential to me.
Sounds like fatigue, Colonel.
His psychological tests don't show any susceptibility to battle psychosis.
Maybe his psychological tests didn't have to fly 57 missions.
Chandler's turned chicken.
It's my job to cut him off at the pass.
You're gonna cut a chicken off at the pass?
I've got to nip this rotten apple in the bud.
This sort of action's contagious.
One man decides he's not gonna fight, it catches on.
Next thing, you know what you got on your hands?
Peace?
I either want Chandler's highly trained thumb up there, pushing the button or I want to get him for dereliction of duty.
Why don't we just remove his thumb and send that over to the 428th?
- Colonel.
- Colonel?
When can I have him?
Give me a medical decision now.
The last C.O.
They had here couldn't make a decision without a month's warning.
I'm not fond of personal abuse, Colonel.
I was in this man's army when the only thumb you cared about was the one you had in your mouth.
Chandler will be able to return to action couple of days.
Good.
But it takes more than four sound legs to make a stallion run.
Takes a sound heart and a sound mind.
It also takes a rider who's not afraid to go to the whip.
Wait a second.
Just a minute.
None of us, least of all this khaki Godzilla qualifies as an expert on emotional stability.
I suggest we have Captain Chandler examined by a top psychiatrist somebody who knows his way around the old attic.
- Got anyone in mind?
- Sidney Freedman.
Major Sidney Freedman.
- Good man?
- Sidney could've talked Oedipus into leaving home.
- Get him.
- Got him.
- Good.
- Freedman.
Is that "E-l" or "l-E"?
Two E's, as in "freedom".
That's what got you confused.
- Major Freedman.
- Yeah?
Colonel Flagg.
We played poker once.
Oh, sure.
With Intelligence, right?
I have nothing to do with Intelligence.
- Better you won't get worry lines.
- Freedman.
How'd you like to do yourself a favor?
Who deserves one more?
Then back me all the way on this Chandler caper.
He's trying to pull a fast one.
I won't have it.
From what I hear, the man needs help.
My kind of help.
You just let one of those creeps get away with a phony messiah complex and before you can say "John the Baptist," we'll be hip deep in sackcloth and ashes.
- We're not gonna let that happen, are we?
- We're not?
Well, we'll see.
Then we'll know.
Part of order, Dr. Freedman, Sidney Theodore, we won't see.
As it happens, I know who you are.
Is that right?
Am I who I think I am?
I've been doing a little digging, Dr. Freedman with two E's.
Your association with certain groups on the attorney general's list of subversive organizations.
"Young Americans for a Lasting Peace "New York Alliance for Young Democrats Doctors' Progressive Conference.
" You're forgetting the Boy Scouts and the psychiatrists' bowling league.
Hold it.
- What do you want?
- I've got work to do, sir.
- Well, let's see how fast you can do it!
- Watch this.
Boy Scouts.
That's funny, Freedman.
Almost as funny as the fact that you never signed your loyalty oath.
You know you can get busted out of the service for that, don't you, Comrade Freedman?
Oh, is that what I am?
- Why didn't you sign it?
- Just between the two of us and whatever mike I might be talking into do you really believe if I were a Communist I'd hesitate for a second to sign a loyalty oath?
I'd like to go on talking to you, Flagg but with your schizophrenia, I'd have to charge you double time.
Now if you'll excuse me, I've already kept Jesus waiting five minutes.
#The more I see you # #The more I want you La- dee- dee- dah- dah # - You!
- What!
- This is the army, soldier!
- I get that feeling too.
- Hey!
- What?
The next time I see you, Tinker Bell, you'd better be in uniform and as G.I. As General MacArthur you hear me?
Loud and clear, Mary.
#With every sigh I'm more mad about you ## Radar tells us Flagg's giving you a hard time.
- He's got a few bugs in his filter.
- What else is new?
Well, the Canadians just took Hill 807.
The marines landed on Inchon.
But the big news is my son's got his first tooth.
Another proud father.
- Nice.
- Nice.
He's not gonna be an analyst.
He's gonna look people in the eye.
- Uh, 130 over 70.
- Where's my patient?
Come to see your savior?
Mine?
No.
Yours?
- Who knows?
- You tell us.
- Where is he?
- Over there.
You don't recognize him from his picture?
So what you're saying is that Judas only did what he had to do.
- Being Judas, he could do nothing else.
- Ah!
But if that is so Come, come!
You boys promised to mingle, and here you are off in the corner, talking shop.
- Hello, Sidney.
- Father.
Captain Chandler, Major Freedman.
- I'm glad to meet you.
- We haven't yet.
My name's Jesus Christ.
Sidney, we won't wait up.
Jesus Christ.
- Yes.
- Your presence poses some interesting questions.
How long have you known your true identity?
What do you mean?
Until about five days ago you were Arnold Chandler.
Now, Arnold Chandler was born in Idaho was raised on the family sheep ranch went to college in Colorado enlisted in the army, went to O.C. S trained as a bombardier, went on over 50 missions and earned most of the medals and commendations that are available.
I'm not Captain Chandler.
You're not from Idaho?
- You're not in the army?
- Of course not.
You're not a bombardier?
I'm Christ, the Lord.
- But you died.
- I arose.
That was a long time ago.
Where have you been since then?
I live on in all men.
What are you doing here in an army hospital?
I'm Christ.
Where should I be?
Should you be in the nose of a B-29?
- B-29?
- That's where you've been a good part of the past two years up in a B-29, dropping bombs.
Bombs.
- On people?
- On the enemy.
I have no enemies.
I love all men.
Even the North Koreans?
They're my children.
Why would I hurt my children?
I'm sorry.
I'm not this Captain Chandler you're looking for, but I hope you can find him.
I hope you can help him.
Tell me, is it true that God answers all prayers?
Yes.
Sometimes the answer is no.
-  - Frank, do you have to do that?
- Do what?
- Crack your knuckles.
All the Burns's men crack their knuckles.
Oh!
Sorry.
I didn't realize I was treading on sacred tradition.
Oh, you two sass boxes think you're so smart!
You just wait and see what happens to your friend Chandler - when the spit hits the Spam.
- Gospel according to Frank.
Frank, scrape the rust off your imagination.
What if the captain is really who he says he is?
No chance.
I tested him.
Said a little prayer to him before.
No big deal.
Just a little test.
- Just in case.
- Just to be on the safe side.
And my prayer wasn't answered.
Stick that in your hair and rub it.
Frank, just because you didn't get any chocolate pudding at lunch doesn't prove anything.
How did you know I prayed for chocolate pudding?
You always pray for chocolate pudding.
You know, if you're not careful, Frank, you're gonna replace Pontius Pilate in the hearts of your fellow men.
You'll be famous.
Your name will be spread all over the newest testament.
Of course, no one'll ever call their kid Frank again.
True.
How many two-year-old Pontius Pilates do you meet?
Oh, I'm washing my hands of the two of you.
Get it?
Washing my hands?
Well, Dr. Freedman, what's the diagnosis?
He's Christ.
If you look closely, you may notice I'm not laughing.
Okay.
He's not Christ.
But he's also not Chandler.
Psychoanalytical double-talk.
- The man's a victim.
- He's bucking for a ticket stateside!
All we gotta do is stuff the guts back in him.
Frank builds the cross, and he's the nail salesman.
You're a victim too, Flagg.
But you're such an unbelievable example of walking fertilizer it's hard for me to care.
Colonel, some men lose an arm or a hand or a leg.
Chandler lost himself.
He's not playing a game.
He spent two years dropping bombs on people who never did anything to him until finally something inside this kid from Idaho said "Enough.
You're Christ.
You're not a killer.
The next bomb you drop, you drop on yourself".
What do you suggest, Doctor?
I think that with a lot of the right kind of help we may be able to turn him back into Arnold Chandler.
We'll never be able to turn him back into a fighting tool.
And it's my professional advice that we don't try.
I gave you a chance to play ball.
Now I'm blowin' the whistle on you, Freedman.
- Blow away.
- Colonel Potter, this man this American, never signed his officer's loyalty oath.
And I intend to see that he's thrown out of the service.
Very smart, Sidney!
- Terrific!
- I wish I'd thought of that.
- Where do we go to not sign?
- You crafty devil.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- You are very smart, Freedman.
- I told you.
You're only saying Chandler flipped out so I will have you busted and you can return to your safe, cozy civilian practice.
- He's onto you, Sid.
- You're not smart, Freedman.
You're dumb.
Very dumb!
But you've met your match in me.
-  - Now, Chandler may get out as a psycho.
He's small potatoes.
The army can teach my mother how to drop bombs.
- Your mother?
- "Whistler's Bombardier".
But you, Major, are here to stay.
Right here, shrink.
Where we can make sure you remain loyal to the country that's gonna hound your every step.
-  - Keep up the good work.
- Thanks, fellas.
- A little locoweed must've gotten mixed in with his feed.
- He always carry on like that?
- I think he's been sniffing his invisible ink.
He's what Freud used to call "spooky".
On the other hand, if Flagg wasn't mean, rotten and crazy - he wouldn't have any personality at all.
-   Attention.
Attention, all personnel.
The evacuation bus is now boarding outside post-op.
It leaves in five minutes.
Sir, uh, my name is Radar O'Reilly.
Remember, I brought you juice?
I remember.
Um, sir, are you really who I mean Are you really him?
Yes.
Oh.
Well, I know you're busy and everything but I was wondering, could you bless this for me, please?
- The bag?
- No.
What's inside.
I know he's not real, but we're very close.
Bless you.
And bless you, Radar.
Um, I'm Walter.
Bless you, Walter.
Thank you, sir.
Bless all of you.
- Kansas.
- Very good.
- Uh, that's "S".
- No kidding.
- Uh, Saratoga.
- No, you did that already.
Uh, Saint Croix.
You owe me an "X".
Uh, "X""X" - Ha!
Is that it?
You ready?
- Whatever.
- Xicotencatl.
- Xicot What's that?
- It's Mexico.
It's in the book.
Look it up.
- Ah, I believe ya.
- All right, "L".
- Los Angeles.
- There's no such place.
- What?
Listen, I've been to Los Angeles, and there's no such place.
Los Angeles is a city.
You owe me an "S".
Sir, can you get Dr. Freedman back here, the psychiatrist?
- On what grounds?
- I'm Moses.
Right?
Freedman's in Tokyo, Klinger.
You take the first left in the road, and then you part the Sea of Japan.
- Oh, ye of little faith.
- That's Matthew.
Maybe I'm him then.
I'll be anyone to get out.
Moses.
Matthew.
Doc, Grumpy, Sneezy!
Bashful, Dopey, Happy!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
##  What's that step you're doing, Radar?
You'll have to ask Nurse Kellye.
She's leading.
Another thrilling night of festivity in South Korea.
Hawkeye, if you had your choice, where would you like to be tonight?
- In the whole world, Father?
- Uh-huh.
Back in my tent shaving my corns.
- Why don't you go do it?
- I'm saving it for the holidays.
Bartender!
A man comes off a dusty cattle drive, can't even get a drink.
Coming, sir.
Just keep moving.
I'll catch up.
You're new around here, ain't you, fella?
You better smile when you say that.
Come on.
Come on!
- Say, ain't you the new schoolmarm?
- Yes, sir.
- You wanna fight?
- I would, sir, but I have such delicate features.
Ah, this mad, gay nightlife.
I think I'll get into my plaid knickers wind up the '32 Packard run up to Newport for croquet with the Vanderbilts.
Writing home again?
That's your third letter this week.
Only way I can keep my sanity.
If you want sanity, you can have mine.
God knows, I'm not using it.
- Radar, you do the Peabody?
- Not while I'm dancing, sir.
Farewell, you mad fools!
I'll be in my tent having a martini with a lizard.
You can really go out of your skull here, Peg.
There's just nothing to do when you're not working.
I remember reading Justice Holmes.
He said "War is an organized bore".
Which brings me to Major Frank Burns, not one of our best doctors.
Hawkeye says he became a surgeon after he washed out at embalmers'school.
This morning he was operating on a kid named Davis and I was the anesthesiologist.
Sometimes you have to double in gas here.
More suction, nurse.
Stop daydreaming!
You're there to assist the doctor, Lieutenant.
Give her a doctor, she'll assist him.
Frank, pulse is weakening, blood pressure dropping.
I'm doing everything I can.
This soldier's a mess.
Gee williewockers!
- Sewer mouth.
- Why must you ride him?
I'll stop soon.
I only paid for an hour.
- No pulse.
- Well, then that's that.
- What do you mean?
Do something!
- He didn't have a chance anyway.
- You can't just give up!
- Have you no respect for the dead?
Cover the belly, Kellye.
Bag him, Frank!
- You're not supposed to tell me what to do.
- Bag.
- Try open heart massage.
- We can do it closed.
I saw it done in the States.
Bag!
- Good.
Rather not open his chest.
- Bag him once every five beats.
- You're going over my head!
- Everything's over your head, Frank.
- Bag!
- Nothing.
Hah!
- Come on, you!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
- Enjoying your dramatics?
Bag!
Bag!
Hey!
I'm getting a pulse.
Good.
Better.
It's going.
- Another unit of whole blood.
- Getting stronger.
- Good work, Doctor.
- Thank you.
I'm not gonna forget this, Hunnicutt.
- He did save the patient, Major.
- It was the way he did it!
I was worried about Davis, so I'm keeping tabs on him.
He's still pretty much up for grabs.
- Mornin', Doc.
- Klinger.
- How's he doin'?
- Hanging in.
Know anything about dreams, Doc?
I only know I wish I were having one right now.
I had one last night.
I was holding this paper that said, "Klinger is hereby declared nuts.
Signed, Colonel Potter".
I was saying good-bye to everybody.
!
I even clipped the hair off my chest for Major Houlihan to keep in her watch.
She kissed me right on the mouth.
Next thing I know, I'm in San Francisco.
Sprung!
Free!
There's this big parade.
Four bands.
People carrying a banner that says, "Klinger's Nuts"!
Shh.
Then I'm in Toledo with my loved ones.
And I own a delicatessen.
Eight tables!
Individual relish jars.
You'll never guess who the waitress is.
Major Houlihan.
And she's still got my hair in her watch pinned on a see-through blouse.
What does that mean, Doc?
Well, it just might mean - that you wanna go home - I knew it!
- With Major Houlihan.
- Yech!
- Morning, B. J., Klinger.
-  Father.
- The same?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, this dreadful war.
The waste!
The waste.
- You gonna stick around a few minutes?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna grab some breakfast.
I won a real egg in a poker game last night.
Lucky devil.
Uh, just a figure of speech.
No change.
You seem jumpy.
Would you like a little phenobarb?
- Maybe 16 milligrams?
- I'd prefer a few milligrams of prayer.
- The guys giving you static?
- The static is coming from higher up.
- The Lord teed off at you?
- Oh, God forbid.
No.
Actually, the difficulty lies between the Lord and the troops.
Colonel Maurice Hollister, Divisional Chaplain.
- I don't know him.
- They call him Attila the Hun of chaplains.
He's coming this afternoon to inspect me and the operations of my flock.
Don't sweat it.
Hawkeye says you're the best chaplain in the business.
- Did he really say that about me?
- Mm-hmm.
Ah.
That crazy agnostic.
- Do you need me, B. J.?
- Not till Sunday.
If you do, I'll be ironing my cassock.
I'd better iron my underwear too.
Hollister's very thorough.
- Oh, the noise!
The people.
- What happened?
- Klinger ate a fresh egg.
- I just wrote that to Peggy.
I wouldn't try.
It loses so much in translation.
He had it poached on a piece of toast freshly baked in 1945.
For a second, it brought back the atmosphere of gracious dining at Nedick's in Grand Central Station.
I'm starved.
You got any of that cake your wife sent you?
Yeah, sure.
Elizabeth Taylor married somebody whose name begins with N-I.
- N- I?
- Nixon!
Elizabeth Taylor married our vice president!
- Nicky Hilton.
- Nicky Hilton's our vice president now?
Here you go.
They also serve who stay at home and bake cakes for us to drink.
It's Peg's first overseas package.
Would you believe that's Annie Get Your Gun?
I had no idea Ethel Merman was so tall.
Chocolate Jockey shorts?
The Hershey bars melted on them.
Attention all personnel.
At 1330 hours - we'll be holding the finals of the cockroach race time trials.
- You going?
Nah.
People who go to those things only want to see a cockroach crash.
Hawkeye just came in.
He loved your cake.
He's really one of a kind, our Hawkeye.
"Finest kind,"as he says.
Without him, I think we'd all go nuts.
This morning he read in Life magazine where students at Cal Tech squeezed 15 people into a Volkswagen.
Hawkeye thought we could beat the record.
-  - Nobody breathe for the next ten minutes!
Let's have no groping, please.
All gropers will report to my tent, and right after that, the "gropees".
Come on.
Get inside.
We're trying to make a record.
- Gage, you're next.
Climb in.
- I don't want to.
I'm shy.
Shy, shmy!
Come on!
For the glory of the 4077.
- The cover of Life magazine.
- All those bodies.
- Come on.
Here comes Lieutenant Gage.
-  All right, you guys.
Lie at attention!
This is completely against military regulations!
- Wholly unauthorized!
- You've got some of my nurses in there.
I'll rinse 'em off before I return them.
Squeeze in, Major.
We got plenty of room.
- This is completely beneath me.
- I was hoping for that spot myself.
We'll see what Colonel Potter has to say about this!
- How many we got here?
Count off.
-  One!
-  - Fine.
All we need is 15 more.
- Wait!
Wait!
I have to take a picture!
-  How 'bout V.D. Films, Radar?
Is the one we've got adequate?
I don't know, sir.
Every time it's shown, I faint.
Must be okay then.
Why don't we order Trench Foot Through the Ages and The Bleeding Gum Story?
- That'll make a good double feature.
- Yes, sir.
I'll order those.
- Let's see.
There's one other -  Come.
Caught this Korean woman trying to take one of the jeeps, sir.
I'll handle it, Sergeant.
Sit down, madam.
- I guess I'll order - Why don't you order those films, Radar?
- What's the big idea, Klinger?
- How'd you know?
Korean women are not noted for hairy knuckles.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't!
I'll do anything to prove I'm not fit.
I'll I'll wet my bed.
I'll wet your bed!
I'll wet the whole camp!
Now, son.
None of us wants to be here.
I don't wanna be here.
Radar doesn't want to be here.
The doctors, the nurses.
Certainly the wounded don't want to be here.
But we've got to do our best.
- Understand, son?
- I'm trying.
Then get your butt in high gear and get back to work!
- That your last offer?
- You got it!
Out!
Yes, sir.
- Colonel, can I see you?
- Do I have a choice?
It's about Captain Pierce.
- He sew up your fly again?
- No, sir.
- He spit at you?
- He's stuffing a bunch of personnel into a jeep.
Something about setting a world's record.
He's a pistol.
Can't you see Pierce is just trying to boost morale?
My morale is fine.
I love it here.
Either you or Klinger is nuts.
Now I've got to figure out which one.
Come on, Major.
Just one more and we'll have a record!
- Yeah!
Come on!
- Come on.
Life magazine.
Yeah!
- Will you photograph my best side?
- Absolutely.
I'm gonna set the timer.
Now, get ready.
Okay.
Get back!
Get back!
- Say "cheese".
-  Cheese!
-  -  Hollister, Maurice, Colonel.
Division Chaplain.
Pierce, Captain.
Band vocalist.
That's quite a crowd you've got in there.
World's record.
- Colonel Hollister.
- Ah, yes.
Major Hooligan.
- Houlihan.
- # Harrigan, that's me # - You okay, Gates?
- Ah.
Can I get a hernia?
Of course.
But rent one first.
See if you really like it.
Get the circulation going.
And remember, you're champions.
- Each and every one of you.
- Captain?
This activity, the morality Did Father Mulcahy approve of all this?
Why don't you ask him yourself, Reverend?
Colonel Hollister.
Father Mulcahy.
Lord, have mercy.
#Amazing grace # # How sweet the sound # #That saved a wretch # - # Like me # -  # I once was lost # # But now am found # #Was blind but now # - #I see ## - Lovely.
# Lovely #  I have a few announcements before the benediction.
For the upcoming Passover celebration for those of the Jewish faith Private Weintraub will attempt to bake some unleavened bread on a rock much in the same way as Private Moses much in the same way that Moses did.
Would you all stand for the benediction, please?
And now, may the Lord bless us all and keep us.
- Amen.
-  Amen.
Father Mulcahy, that has to be one of the finest services I've ever attended.
Thank you, sir.
Excellent service, Chaplain.
Excellent.
I really enjoyed it.
Sensational, Father!
You're ready to play the Vatican.
- Oh, my.
- Aces, Father.
That was really neat.
Especially that scary part about going to hell.
Colonel, you're presence today was a first-rate inspiration.
I get chills in the presence of a real spiritual leader.
Thank you, Majors.
I, uh, gather you're regular churchgoers.
- Oh, yes!
It's a great place to kill an hour.
- Oh, yes!
We better scoot along.
There's no Sabbath for the second in command.
Nor for the head nurse.
God appreciates your responsibilities.
He's a good person.
Major.
Well, sir, it seemed to go rather smoothly.
Didn't it?
So does wallpaper paste, Father.
You never once had them in the palm of your hand.
You've got to grab these people.
You're God's messenger in this camp.
Sir, I deliver Many a business has gone bankrupt with the motto, "We Deliver".
You've got to take these people by the hand, Father.
You just got to reach out and take them by the hand each and every one.
From the lowliest private here right up there to Captain Harry S. Truman.
You've got to guide them.
You've got to lead them!
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes!
You've got to be the one!
You've got to be the drum major that leads this band right into the valley of blessedness!
You have to use that voice of yours, Father as a cry into the wilderness.
Follow me!
You, see.
Follow me!
Lead the attack, Father, with a Bible in one hand and a sword in the other!
Hallelujah!
Did I write you about Colonel Potter wanting to train Koreans to work in the wards?
First step was to teach them English.
Do you have a fever?
Do you have a fever?
I will get the doctor.
I will get the doctor.
Better dead than red.
Better dead than red.
- Ah!
Now we're getting somewhere!
-  Yeah.
Get us out of the U.N.  Get us out of the U.N. Don't contaminate our drinking water with fluoridation.
Don't contaminate our Mares eat oats and does eat oats, and little lambs eat ivy.
Mares eat oats and does eat oats You sure took your sweet time relieving me.
I've been here an hour.
We made progress.
- I can tell.
You've got a Korean accent.
- Stink fishpot!
Stink fishpot.
Okay, boys!
Notre Dame is six points behind.
We got a whole half a game to play, and we're gonna beat Army!
All right.
I'm sorry.
I will - I will -  I will - get - get - the nurse.
- The nurse.
I will get the nurse.
- I will get the nurse.
- Good.
Frank Burns eats worms.
Frank Burns eats worms.
I've looked back on this letter and discovered it's been two pages since I told you how much I love you.
It's two pages later now, and I love you even more.
Colonel Hollister is running Father Mulcahy ragged.
I'm sure Hollister believes God is regular army.
They just went into post-op.
Private Davis is our worst case at the moment, Colonel.
We're having a difficult time with him.
Massive trauma, and he's slow coming back.
Poor fellow.
His father runs the last pony ride at Palisades Park in New Jersey.
After the service, he plans to go into ponies, God willing.
Davis, huh?
Davis.
Ah!
"P".
He's a Protestant.
A lot of your Davises are "J's," you know.
I had one here last year who was a "C".
There are exceptions, of course.
Have you written the lad's parents?
If you'll excuse us, Colonel.
I have to change his dressing.
Nice touch.
I'm not sure a letter's the best course just now.
Take my word for it.
Write the young man's parents.
It's always been my policy to wait until the patients become stable.
Nonsense.
That boy's going to pull through.
What you've got to do you've got to marry that thought to an action.
You write a good, strong affirmative letter.
- Mention the donkeys.
- The ponies.
It seems wrong to get their hopes up and then - God forbid!
What if - Lieutenant Mulcahy I want to see a first draft of the letter before 1800 hours.
It's now 1400 hours.
I've got to take my milk of magnesia and do three pushups.
I realize supply requisitions in this area are difficult to fill but the situation has been getting steadily worse.
We order rectal thermometers, we get spark plugs.
Both useful articles, but hardly interchangeable.
Get with it, Supply.
Sir, do you want one or two exclamation points after that?
- Make it three.
- You really are mad.
Kindness don't feed the bulldog.
Now what?
Caught this man walking into the stream seven miles down the road.
I would've made it if they hadn't nailed me.
Had it all figured!
Downstream to the Inchon River!
Then out to the Sea of Japan.
- And then to the Golden Gate!
- You'd have drowned.
No chance, sir.
There!
Look at that!
Klinger!
Klinger!
Good letter, Father.
Positive, affirmative, hopeful.
I liked the way you worked the ponies in.
It wasn't difficult, sir.
I just started a new paragraph.
I still think I should've waited until the boy is more stable.
Tommyrot!
Forge ahead.
-  - It's your straggler who misses the Lord's streetcar.
Vaya con Dios.
Father!
Father Mulcahy!
Have you seen Captain Pierce anywhere?
I believe he mentioned Nurse Shibetta.
He was gonna share a spicy salami with her.
She's Italian, you know.
- One of the patients is in bad trouble.
- Who?
- Private Davis.
- I best see if I can help.
- Get Captain Pierce.
- Yes, sir.
Gee, I hate to interrupt his salami.
- Temperature?
- 103.
- I've seen higher.
- Sure.
Philadelphia in August.
Klinger, hurry up with that X ray!
- What about the latest urine specimen?
- Bugs and blood.
- White count?
- 19,000.
- Peritonitis.
Someone must've missed a hole in the bowel.
- I missed nothing!
None of us are perfect, Frank.
Especially those of us who aren't perfect.
Kellye!
- Give him 600,000 units of penicillin, stat!
-  Ah-ha-ha!
- Sorry about the salami.
Klinger!
- Phew!
A minute, 27 seconds.
Take a discharge out of petty cash.
- There they are.
- Shell fragments?
Frank, you just can't just look around!
You gotta feel around!
- He does!
- I mean, during surgery.
Fragments may not mean much, but in view of his symptoms, we've gotta go back in.
You can't!
His pulse is weakening, and he has a fever.
We go in or it's the big train ride home in the mattress cover.
- Why did I do it?
-  What, Father?
Colonel Hollister made me write a letter to his parents.
"Everything's okay".
Let's go, folks.
Frank.
- Is he gonna make it?
- Probably.
It depends.
We could get bombed, there could be an earthquake or Frank could operate on him again.
Twerp!
You tell 'em, ferret face.
Aha!
Heidelberg, 1910.
Zuckertort's attack.
Things are pretty quiet right now.
Private Davis pulled through, mercifully, and was shipped stateside.
Potter doubled the guards, so Klinger isn't giving him any trouble.
- What'd you do?
- Vienna, 1906.
The Lapinsky move.
- Where'd you learn that?
- Mrs. Lapinsky.
Tall woman, hairy legs, always carried a bag of strudel.
- You don't know Mrs. Lapinsky.
- Are you kidding?
I caught hairy legs from her.
Nice try, Klinger.
I would've made it if not for that dog!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
-  Slow it down, Pierce.
!
- Yes, Frank.
- Come on, watch it!
- Yes, dear.
- Hey, stop!
- What?
Stop here.
- Are you crazy, Frank?
- I wanna get a shot of this.
-  - So do they!
Get in!
Letting her go without a search, Sergeant?
- Mind your branch of the service.
- That's perfect camouflage for a bomb.
A bomb?
The woman's obviously eight-months gone with a Sherman tank.
- Enemy infiltration's everywhere, chum.
And it's not funny.
-   -  Sorry, Colonel.
- You idiot.
- I said I was sorry.
- Sorry don't feed the bulldog!
You want me to launder it?
I know a great little rock down by the stream.
- Who is this man, Major?
- Captain Pierce, sir.
Personally, I'm Major Burns.
We're surgeons with the 4077.
You don't care a hoot about military courtesy, do you?
All you doctors care about is medicine.
I don't sir.
I mean, I'm different.
You operate the same way you drive?
With your eyes closed?
Colonel, yesterday a Korean bus hit a mine a couple of miles up the road.
We spent the entire night sewing I'm sleepy, I'm hungry, I'm tired and I'm sorry about your uniform.
If you send me your size, I'll knit you a new one.
How goes it, Zale?
Terrific.
If it was goin' any better, I'd kill myself.
Sergeant, you can't drink this early in the morning.
I know.
I keep trying.
What is it?
Or do you mind telling me?
I don't mind telling you.
It's bourbon.
You want some?
I had just enough bourbon last night.
Unfortunately, I had just enough gin as well.
- Letter.
-  Sounds like the truce talks are going well.
Nine years we were married.
The woman's body was sacred to me.
Lying next to her was like being in church.
- I had no idea you were so religious.
- Read this.
I've read those letters.
"Funny thing happened, dear.
One of your suits came back from the cleaners with somebody else in it".
Right?
I'll read it.
- It says here she's sorry.
She loves you.
- Yeah, sorry.
Loves me, loves me.
Sorry.
Has an affair with the joker next door and she wants me to forgive her.
- She says it's you she wants, not him.
- I'll never get her back.
He'll keep her in the closet with the power drill he never returned.
One married man to another.
The woman that wrote that deserves another chance.
Yeah, I'll give her another chance.
I'll stick a grenade in her girdle.
A little understanding, huh?
She may have done it for you.
To get your power drill back.
Zale, scream, cry, yodel, anything.
But don't hit.
Don't You hit.
Congratulations, Sergeant.
You just turned your right hand into a maraca.
After I set it, you can sit in with the relief band.
- How come I don't feel no pain?
- It's swimming upstream against the bourbon.
Corpsman!
Let's go!
I need some bodies here!
We got two for pre-op.
I need some whole blood and some sedation.
I give the orders here, Captain.
Let's get him into pre-op.
- We need whole blood and sedation.
- I wish I'd said that.
- What have we got?
- Grenade fragments.
Checkpoint just down the road.
- We almost bought it ourselves, sir.
- Oh, we did not.
This one's an enemy infiltrator.
Be careful.
He could be rigged.
Right.
His shorts could go off any second.
Listen, bub, I almost got killed out there.
All right, Major.
Don't get your clusters in an uproar.
- Move 'em.
- Put me down.
That's an order.
What's the problem, Colonel?
I demand transportation to the 121 st Evac Hospital.
This is where you want your surgery.
You're at the best MASH unit in Korea.
Give or take a few thumbs.
- I don't want that man touching me.
- We met.
- He outdid himself in rudeness.
- Thanks, Frank.
Get started on the Korean.
Someone got a sedative for this man?
- Yes, sir.
- Why do I have to work on the Korean?
I mean, he always gets the cowboys and I'm stuck with the Indians.
I'm one-fourth Cherokee.
Oh.
How.
- What are you doing back there?
- Stealing a smoke.
- Just lower his pants.
- I'll have your butt for this.
Seems only fair.
He'd sink to the bottom of the pool with that in him.
- I hear ticking.
- Did you check his navel for a time bomb, Frank?
Don't think I didn't, fella.
Ah, give me a knife.
- What are you doing?
- Extending the incision.
Have a large rib retractor ready.
After I retract the lung, you'll see why.
Shrapnel in the heart muscle.
A simple rearrangement of God's handiwork by explosives.
- Pipe down, will ya?
- He's dying as quietly as he can, Frank.
- Suction here.
- Can't trust any of these people.
- More here.
- Treacherous, deceitful.
- Pickups with teeth.
- And clever, boy.
They don't all look alike by accident.
Good.
Very good.
Six-year-old cuts into a box of Cracker Jacks to find the prize.
And the next thing he knows, he's a surgeon.
A crackerjack surgeon.
Nice of you to write this letter for me, Captain.
I plaster hands and cement relations.
Dear who?
Hillda.
That's with two "L's".
Captain Hunnicutt, one of the docs here, is writin' this letter for me.
Slow down.
My dictation cost me my last eight jobs.
Oh.
Because my right hand is out of action.
- Better?
- Go on.
Where do I take it from there?
War is a time of loneliness and deprivation for a soldier - I like that.
- And for the wife he leaves behind.
But I see you kicked the loneliness habit and you ain't been so deprived either.
Try again.
When I read your letter, naturally I was hurt.
- To the quick.
- Yeah, there too.
Nine years I gave that woman love, trust and devotion!
And how does she pay me back?
She cheats on me!
- Easy!
The class theme is forgiveness.
- Forgive her?
Forget it.
I made that woman a queen.
Whatever she wanted!
Hi-fi, a beaver coat, her own bowling shoes.
I sent her brother through college.
I paid for every tooth in her mother's head.
You're clearly a humanitarian.
One more humane act.
- Humane?
I'll show you humane.
- Don't!
The right hand got away with it, the left one goes to the stockade.
Ahh.
Where was I?
Try this.
You're a beautiful woman, Hillda, and a lovely wife.
- And I very much want to spare you any more pain.
- I don't know about that.
Attention, Captain Hunnicutt.
Please report to the hospital.
Major Burns probably taped himself to a patient again.
We'll finish later.
Yeah, right.
Whatever she wanted!
Charm bracelet, steam iron plastic wedgies.
Oooh, Charlie tastes good!
- Everyone here, Corporal?
- All presently accounted for, sir.
Who's this one?
-  This is Mr. Park, the peddler, sir.
- Oh, yes.
!
You can get anything from Mr. Park, including a bullet in the head.
- Confiscate this weapon.
- That's not a weapon, sir.
It's a lighter.
Interesting, most interesting.
Yes.
Hmm.
This is Kim, the houseboy, sir.
Kim is very good at repairing electric shavers and things.
Uh-huh, and wiring a stick or two of dynamite together, eh, Kim?
Blow up a few white devils?
Uh, this is Mrs. Shin.
She does the laundry for the nurses.
Are you aware, Corporal, that you can shave a bar of soap turn it into powder, set a detonator inside, and pow it'll explode?
Sure kill the laundry, wouldn't it?
- This is Charlie, her son.
-  That's an innocent-looking child.
- He's six years old.
- That's what they all say.
That size, yeah.
That juvenile appearance.
Be perfect cover for who knows what.
- Major!
- And what's this, huh?
It's a sandwich.
It may look like a sandwich, but you open it and it's Ham.
No eating in the ranks.
- From now on, camp security will be tight as a drum.
- Yes.
No more door-to-door peddling.
No more come and go as you "likee".
Every morning you all see the guard for a pass.
You will keep your soap visible and in bar form and exit the area no later than 1:00 p.m. And you, no more freeloadin' in the mess tent.
You savvy?
- Will that be all, sir?
- Just about, Corporal.
-  - Hit the deck!
Just a baseball, sir.
Must have gotten away from somebody.
- It might've been one of theirs.
- I don't think they play baseball.
Here you go, Lieutenant.
-  Thanks, Radar.
- Yo.
- Shall I dismiss the locals now, sir?
- Yeah, I guess.
- He wants ten bucks for the lighter.
- I'll take it.
- But I'll only give him five.
- Seven-fifty.
- Seven-fifty?
- It's his country.
- Six and not a penny more.
- I can't say six in Korean.
- Say five and 100 pennies.
- Six and 100 pennies.
- Done.
- Seven bucks.
- Huh?
- Oh, I woke you.
I'm sorry.
No, no, let's try it again tomorrow at my place.
- Have you been here all night?
- Every c.c. Of it.
Lieutenant Snyder wasn't on duty to do her nails.
She's a nurse.
No offense.
He needed a doctor, not a nurse.
Twice his chest tubes plugged up on him.
If I wasn't here, he'd have been busted down to cadaver.
- How's he doing?
- Fine.
Respiration's normal, and no blood through the tube.
- Then he'll live.
- I've been trying to break it to you as gently as possible.
Couple of months, he'll be out checking natives under the armpits again.
There's only one reason this man didn't die.
H.Q. Didn't cut him his orders.
- I've never seen you work better.
- Somebody tell him.
Somebody will, I'm sure.
In the meantime, I'd like to congratulate you myself, Doctor.
I'm honored, touched and aroused.
Why must you always spoil things?
I'll kiss whatever you like and make it better.
How 'bout you?
A bomb!
They're burying a bomb!
- He's just come out of it, sir.
- Good.
Well, you're gonna be all right, Colonel.
The worst is over.
- Colonel.
- Yes?
That officer, Pierce.
An oddball.
Must make an example of him.
He already is a fine example of an oddball officer.
The best.
Has no respect for the uniform.
Well, he's never in it anyway.
No respect for authority.
- No respect for the war.
- Whoa, Colonel.
Whoa.
I demand disciplinary action against him.
If you don't take it, I will.
You?
You're only a bunch of tubes running in and out.
You have to go to the latrine by remote control.
You're a sick man.
You'd be napping at the morgue if it wasn't for Pierce working on you.
Hmm?
He operated?
Not you?
Lucky for you, yes.
But the last thing I said Would've been the last.
If Pierce wasn't your surgeon, you'd be a bag of cold cuts.
Jumpin'jodhpurs, man.
!
I'm regular army too.
Hash marks down to the ground.
I started in the cavalry.
Learned to look at life from the top of a horse.
Sometimes I feel I'm still on a horse, only I'm looking down at a horse's I'm not criticizing your command, Colonel.
It's that that goof-off.
That goof-off saved your can!
You're alive and kicking, kicking like an army mule because of that man's skill and dedication as a surgeon.
Sufferin' saddle soap!
You owe your life to that man!
It's a miss.
!
Yeah.
Okay, ready for my shot?
Okay, G-3.
Right.
- We're playing Battleship.
- Not getting enough war around here?
I did it!
I won!
I sunk a carrier!
Imagine, a carrier!
- Round of drinks for the bridge.
- Sparky, I gotta go now.
Right.
Over and out.
Thanks.
Boy, I never won before.
This is terrific.
- Congratulations, Admiral.
- Aw, thanks.
- Have you seen Sergeant Zale?
- Yeah, I tied his shoelaces for him about 20 minutes ago.
- Where was that?
- In front of his tent.
- He's not out in front of his tent, nor is he inside.
- Did you try the officers' club?
Yeah.
They untied his shoelaces last night.
He hasn't been back since.
- I don't know then.
- If he shows up, tie both his shoes together and call me.
- I finished his letter.
- Okay.
You like your ice cream all mushy?
Mushier the better.
You like Chinese food?
Like to walk in the rain?
- Yes, sir.
- You could've been my wife.
Yes, sir.
- Sir?
He might be with his moose.
- Again, Radar?
I said, Sergeant Zale might be with his moose.
The sergeant has a moose?
Sir, a moose is a Korean girlfriend of the opposite sex.
This one's hut is down the road by the bend near where we bury the arms and legs.
- How's the colonel?
- Stable.
- Respiration okay?
- Fine.
- Temperature?
B.P.?
Pulse?
- All normal.
They sure don't write emergencies the way they used to.
It wasn't an emergency.
He was just anxious to see you.
- Any idea why?
- To thank you?
Colonel.
Captain Pierce.
I just had a talk with your C.O. About you.
My stethoscope was burning.
Said you did a bang-up job on me.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thank him.
He's the one that said it.
Well, don't you have anything you want to say about my bang-up job?
I'm not your commanding officer.
I just thought that, considering you came in here in more pieces than a Tinkertoy and considering I busted my butter knife to put all those pieces back together again you just might want to say "thank you" too.
I'm an artillery officer, Pierce.
I've bombed the hell out of targets you couldn't see if you stood on top of'em.
And nobody ever thanked me.
Oh.
Colonel, just exactly what did you want to see me about?
Your C.O., he's a good man.
I've got a lot of respect for him.
As a personal favor to him I'm not gonna lower the boom on you.
- You're not - Although God knows I should.
And that hat and robe, no shave.
You're a disgrace to your commission.
Nevertheless, you're not gonna lower the boom.
Yeah.
I'm lettin' you off the hook.
Letting me off the hook!
- This time.
- Yeah.
And next time, watch it.
Colonel Spiker, sir I don't know how to thank you for this.
- Mmm, Captain Pierce?
- Yes, sir?
Forget it.
Forget it?
He told me to forget it!
Another bottle here.
Put it on my tab.
Bless you, sir, bless you.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Good morning, ma'am.
Can I interest you in a year's subscription to Shack and Garden?
Thank you.
- Hey, Doc!
Come on in.
- Very nice.
Right cozy.
Yeah.
Uh, have a couple of eggs?
Fresh off the lawn.
Eggs Benedict Arnold, right?
Nourishing, but treacherous.
- Eggs what?
- No, thanks.
- Uh, some coffee then?
- Had my fill at the mess tent.
You remember the mess tent, don't you, Sergeant?
We met there yesterday while you were drinking some antifreeze.
Her name is Sooky.
How do you do, Sooky?
She don't understand a word of English.
- Who is your interpreter?
- Don't need none.
She practically reads my mind.
I wasn't thinking that.
So, you bagged yourself a moose.
Well, uh, you Yeah.
Need a hunting permit?
Or just rewrite your marriage license?
Who knows when we could be knocked off, Doc.
You know, we're three miles from the front.
That's pretty close to the action.
Yes.
Some of us are a little closer to the action than others.
I don't make up the rules.
I mean, I'm a man, you know?
It's not the same with a man.
- Carry your own double standard into battle, Zale.
- What's this?
I took the liberty of finishing your letter to Mrs. Zale, East.
All it needs is your John Hancock, or Syngman Rhee, if you like.
Ah.
Pretty understanding, ain't I?
Yeah, well, you're just that kind of guy.
"To wrap it up, honey: 'To err is human, to forgive divine".
' Or as in your case, the other way around.
Give me your pen.
- What are you doing, Frank?
- You're gonna have to move.
I'm not moving.
I called ahead six months ago for this field.
- Go play someplace else.
- I'm warning you.
You could be in danger.
No, Frank, you could be in danger.
I'm very tired, Frank.
You know how cranky I get when I haven't had my nap.
Listen, you could be sitting on the biggest bomb in Korea!
Frank, I think it's only fair to warn you that my falcon will be here in 30 seconds.
It's over here, Private.
This way.
- What's Frank up to?
- I think he's vacuuming Korea.
Eisenhower's coming.
He wants everything just so.
- Can I help?
- I saw two natives burying a bomb out here.
Obviously to destroy the whole installation.
- Frank, you're paranoid.
- I am not.
- When did you see it?
- When I was checking my toothpaste for explosives.
You were checking your toothpaste for explosives, Gracie?
- Sir, here.
Fresh earth.
- What?
I saw that!
It was with Paul Muni and Luise Rainer.
Dig, Private.
Dig, dig, dig, dig!
Back, everybody, back.
- That's far enough.
- I think I've hit something, sir.
Well, lift it out very carefully.
Paranoid, huh?
- What smells?
- Frank's bomb.
Don't!
It's a kimchi pot, Frank.
Kimchi!
Pickled cabbage.
They ferment it in the ground.
There are millions of these buried all over Korea.
I'd get title to this land, Major, before word gets out.
- Huh?
- Don't you understand, man?
You've struck cole slaw.
Let's hear it for the major, folks.
Isn't he great?
He'll be back, folks just after he changes for the 11:00 bomb.
##  Hard day at the office?
I put a colonel back together.
I used the spare parts of two majors.
Good thinking.
- You?
- Nothing today.
Set Sergeant Zale's hand yesterday.
Got a "Dear John" from his wife, and tried to go ten rounds with the mess tent stove.
Un, deux, trois.
What?
What?
What?
Fastest lighter in the West.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
- Potatoes?
- Yeah.
- Corn?
- Yeah.
What's underneath that gravy there?
Only The Shadow knows, hmm?
I'll take some.
Keep eating this slop and you'll get the purple tongue.
Think you've got enough to eat there, son?
I can always go back for more, sir.
- Colonel, Major Burns has something to say.
- What is it?
He'd like you to start right away.
He has to be back on post-op duty in half an hour.
You're in very high voice today, Frank.
Maybe you should loosen your shorts.
Still suffering from incurable "wisecrackeritis," eh, Pierce?
Right.
The doctors have given me six months before I kill you.
All right.
We're supposed to be officers here.
Set an example, which is one reason I've called this meeting.
Radar, take notes.
- Yes, sir.
- If you haven't eaten your pencil.
First of all, let me say I appreciate how tired you all are.
Unfortunately, until we find out what's causing this fever thing - we're gonna have to keep working round the clock.
- Any news from the lab at Seoul?
Father Mulcahy's down there now on "R" and "R".
- Rest and resurrection.
- I'm hoping he'll come back with some new info.
Meantime, we can expect more fever patients by tonight.
- We're running out of beds now.
- I'm for doubling up.
- I bet.
- I'm just that kind of guy.
- Can I break in with a little trivia about the subject?
- Doctor.
How do you deal with a disease that doesn't even have a name no antibiotics that work, nothing we can do but supportive care?
Yeah.
What ever happened to the good old days?
Artery transplants, resecting intestines something we could sink our teeth into.
I guess all that went out with good taste, Frank.
There is one hunch from H.Q.
They think there's a possibility the fever could be caused by rat-borne mites and fleas.
Has anyone noticed more rats around the camp lately?
Just the old couple that's building a family room in my shaving kit.
I've seen rats around here the size of dogs.
I've even heard some complaining about people running around their tent.
I want to establish a control officer who will be responsible for all the rats on the base.
Volunteers?
Very sporting, Pierce.
N-Not at all.
My friends, some men are born great.
Others achieve greatness.
And others are destined to work with rats.
I would like to nominate someone who is eminently qualified a man who was born for this job a man who can look a rat in the eye and meet him on his own terms.
I give you Major Frank Burns.
- Will anyone second this motion?
-  Hear, hear.
Thank you, but I really can't accept.
I'm already in charge of rumor control.
I've heard that.
I think if this assignment helps relieve the fever situation there ought to be some sort of promotion.
Maybe even a field mouse commission.
All right, all right.
But just remember: Frank Burns did more than his share.
Also, morale has become a problem.
But I have something here that might be helpful in picking people up.
It's a war department directive for a soldier of the month contest.
- Some lucky enlisted man will get to spend six days in Tokyo.
- Wow.
All you have to do is win the war in 25 words or less.
- Why can't they send all the guys over?
- And stop the fighting?
Have you ever seen a general in an unemployment office?
"Candidates will be judged on dress and deportment.
Finalists will be given an oral quiz on historical knowledge".
- Announce this and have everyone bone up.
- Yes, sir.
The judge, by order of H.Q., will be Second-In-Command Major Burns.
I heard that.
You know, I've never been to Tokyo, sir.
But it sure has been a pet dream of mine ever since I was a tiny, little soldier.
- Down, Radar.
- Right.
I think this is an excellent directive.
Nothing is too good for the men.
I guess that's why they get so much of it.
Nice of you to come out and favor the enlisted.
Well, of course.
I may be higher in rank but we all zip our pants the same way.
Why do I feel this meeting is over?
Dismissed.
At ease, soldier.
You'll give yourself a concussion.
Leave him alone.
I find it refreshing to see a salute around here for a change.
That goes double ditto for me.
These two get any more G.I., we'll have to start folding them at sunset.
- Ma'am, don't strain your gut.
- Thank you, Corporal.
Soldier of the month candidate, right?
Tie and everything.
Love the way you shined your nose.
- You figure I got a chance with him?
- I think he prefers blonds.
All right.
Get moving, Corporal.
Stop standing there trying to sell a pup.
Yes, sir, Your Majorship.
Another fever case.
His temperature's very high.
He's got chills and a severe headache.
A thousand c.c.'s?
Who ordered this?
What's it to you, friend?
Frank, don't you think maybe it's time we started cutting down on fluids?
These men are thirsty, Dr. Nosenheimer.
I didn't have to study medicine for seven years to know the prescription for thirst is water.
Yeah, but look at the kidney output.
He's taken in two liters today, and he hasn't produced enough to water Aunt Martha's petunias.
His kidneys have shut down.
Acute renal failure.
These men are dehydrated from the fever which is why we're giving them fluids in the first place.
Even you understand that, don't you, Major?
You don't look at all well, Frank.
Well, you stay up all night slicing cheese for rattraps.
Pierce!
Now that one's all right.
His temperature's almost normal.
He's also in shock.
Acute renal shutdown.
We gotta get both these guys to the 121 st Hospital.
- That's 50 miles away.
- That's where the kidney machine is, Frank.
- And they don't have a long cord.
- Sir.
Hawkeye.
- Thanks for the knighthood, Radar.
- Huh?
- What is it?
- Father Mulcahy's back from Seoul.
He's got news.
All right.
Good.
Get us a chopper.
Tag these two for the 121 st.
- All right.
- B. J. - Think you can handle things?
I was suing people for payment before you even thought of being a doctor.
It seems both the Japanese and the Russian soldiers came down with this very same kind of fever same symptoms, everything in northern Manchuria during the late '30s.
Well, what was it, Father?
What are we dealing with?
It was a Japanese-American uh, Nisei who was going through some old Japanese medical journals when he came across the name "hemorrhagic fever," and he realized that we're dealing with the same thing.
The doctors then were just as perplexed as you are now.
- Great.
We know what to call it.
- Only, we don't know how to cure it.
There isn't a cure.
The only treatment is common sense medicine.
- Well, that leaves out Frank.
- Wait, wait.
There's more.
"You must be very, very careful to restrict fluids".
You see, the fever often causes the kidneys to shut down.
It seems that if enough fluids accumulate a man can actually drown in his own tissues.
- Can you imagine that?
- So we were right.
- Thanks for the confirmation, Father.
- Confirmation is my middle name.
Here's some letters from H.Q., sir.
Oh, yes.
Fan mail from the rear echelon.
Oh, good.
Soldier of the month quiz.
- And the answers.
- Oh.
Yeah.
Better put this in the company safe.
- Combination, Radar?
- Uh, your wife's measurements, sir.
Right.
Forty-two thirty-six, forty-two.
Been bonin' up on your history, Radar?
Oh, yes, sir.
It's just that there's so much to cover.
- I'm not sure I'll learn it in time.
- Well, perhaps I can help you.
- What part have you gotten up to?
- Just finished Genesis, sir.
Can you tell me how long Adam and Eve were here before Columbus?
It's quite a long story, son.
Maybe after dinner.
I know it was at least 100 years 'cause there was Indians here by then.
Sir, I hope you remember I did this for you when the contest rolls around.
- For Pete's sake, hurry up!
- The truth is, I'm not really crazy.
I only wore dresses so people would think that.
But I know I have to be sane to be soldier of the month, so I'm telling you I am unless, of course, you don't pick me, in which case I'm still nutsy fagin, and I never said one word of this.
- Corporal, you're giving me a headache.
- I'm sorry, sir.
Whew!
Boy, this stuff's really barf-making.
You think the rats will go for it?
That happens to be my wife's fruitcake, Corporal of which you should be well-acquainted since you are one yourself!
Sir, you don't look well.
I mean, even less well than usual.
- Get on with it, creepo.
- Yes, sir.
- Frank?
- Hmm?
-  - What time does your pillow go into labor, Frank?
-  - Did you get one?
That stupid thing just went off and broke half my knuckles!
That does it!
Contest or no contest I'm not pushin' any more of your traps!
You're trying to catch rats in this box, Frank?
Box?
This happens to be a finely-honed mechanism which I invented myself.
Now watch.
The rat enters here sees himself in the mirror, which he mistakes for another rat.
Now this device swings down and taps him causing him to turn around to see who wants him.
When he does, whammo!
These steel knobs come down and crack him right in the skull.
-  - That's positively brilliant, Frank!
By the time you're through, a lot of rats are gonna need to be fitted for glasses.
And he called me a fruitcake!
Why don't you take this - Start a rat resort.
- Now what are you talking about?
If these buggers are causing the fever, we've got to exterminate them.
Frank, it's the mites and the fleas on the rats that could be causing the fever.
When the rats die, the mites and fleas jump on us.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
I mean, I've already carried a couple out to the trash.
And I didn't get any fleas.
L-I didn't feel well afterwards, but l-l-l-I'm not sick.
I mean just because a person needs to faint Here we go.
Soldier of the month questions and answers.
Come to Papa.
He used to be Albert Anastasia's doorman.
- All's quiet in the nursery.
-  Is that you, dear?
- Frank.
-  - Right here, Frank.
- Let me sleep, okay?
It's your turn to take mother to the toilet.
Frank, it's us.
- Hi!
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi!
- I'm so thirsty.
If you'd just loan me a teeny, tiny drop of water, I promise to give it back.
We can't, Frank.
I think I've swallowed my lips.
If you drink too much water, it builds up in your tissues.
And just between us and your kidneys, they've had more than enough.
When they start to get rolling full force, it'll be like barrel time at Niagara Falls.
- You have a fever.
- If I had two fevers, I could give you change for a ten.
-  - Go to sleep, Frank.
- I'll give you $10 for a drink of water.
- We can't.
- Try not to think about it.
-  You're the doctors.
I don't really like being one, you know.
I mean, I wouldn't mind being a doctor if I didn't have to be around sick people.
People don't like being sick either, Frank.
My mother used to smack me when I got sick.
She used to smack me when I got well too.
Rest, Frank, and don't talk.
Oh, sure.
I know.
You don't wanna talk to me.
Nobody ever did.
The only one who talked to me in high school was the janitor.
He used to show me his pictures of heavyweight champs.
He was the last person who liked me.
- We like you, Frank.
- Oh, you're just saying that because you feel sorry for me.
Not at all.
I haven't felt sorry for you since we sewed up the legs on all your jockey shorts.
Oh, it's all right.
Now that I'm dying, you can fess up.
Do you really like me?
- You're not really dying, Frank.
- Do you?
Let me put it this way, Frank.
If we were the last two people left on earth I'd never forget to send you a Christmas card.
Real pals.
- Can I share a secret with you?
- It's up to you.
- Promise you won't tell.
- Cross our cardiograms.
Margaret and I are dating.
Oh.
Number three.
"Nathan Hale".
Nathan Hale.
Sure beats studying.
"Lewis and Clark".
Gentlemen.
Since your official judge, Major Burns, is really not well I have been given both the great privilege and dubious honor of replacing him.
Uh, you may stand.
Just take your seats.
My associatejudge, Captain B.J. Hunnicutt who was instrumental in last year's selection of Miss Junior Puberty and Miss Gutter Ball.
Thank you, fan.
"You are here to take this historical quiz because you have surpassed your colleagues in dress and deportment".
How, we'll never know.
But that is not for small minds to ponder, and Lord knows there are enough of those around.
-  Got a new hair coming in, Klinger?
- Sir, I have something to say.
I yield the floor to Miss Virgin Islands.
I hope the judges take into consideration I am presenting myself in full uniform right down to my underwear which, for the first time since I've been in the service is of the correct kind for a person of my sex and/or gender.
Sit down.
Let's get on with it before I forget what I learned.
- Shouldn't be too hard for you, peabrain.
- Hey.
Strike those two from Miss Congeniality.
Now"Name this country's first president and the city in which he took the oath of office".
- Oh, I know.
I know!
- Quiet, would ya?
I can't think.
- Ooh, sir!
-  Radar.
Uh, George Washington.
He was the first, and, uh, he had wooden teeth.
Right.
And every time he told a lie, they chopped one out.
He was sworn in, in New York.
Very good.
Half point for Klinger, half point for Radar.
I knew that.
"What famous symbol of American freedom has a crack in it"?
And it is not General MacArthur's head.
A crack in it.
- Sir!
The Liberty Bell!
-  Very good, Radar.
- Whew!
- Uh, Sergeant Zale.
"Many of the settlers who came to California in 1848 were searching for what"?
Palm trees.
How the hell do I know?
I'm from Brooklyn.
- Igor.
- I thought there were gonna be refreshments here.
Wrong.
And now back to our acrobat Klinger.
I lost track, sir.
Do I have to answer that one, sir?
If you can.
Uh, what number question is that, sir?
- I'm mixing 'em up.
- You can't do that, sir.
I learned history from the beginning.
Next question.
- Margaret?
-  Right here.
Oh.
You're the only one who really cares.
- Yes.
- Just you and my wife.
Don't press me, Frank.
I want you two to be friends.
After I'm gone, you can both work on the Frank Burns Memorial together.
Don't talk that way.
You're not going anywhere.
- I'm not going to die?
- You're not going to die.
Oh.
Frank, have you made out a will?
Will?
Why do I need a will if I'm not going to die?
Everybody has to die sometime, Frank.
Well, you'd think they'd give officers a break.
You ought to dictate a will to Father Mulcahy.
Not that you're not all right but just in case something happens and you don't get to stay all right for much longer.
Margaret if I should go before you Iook for me when you get there.
I'll be waiting for you on the other side.
Frank.
Oh, darling.
And if I'm standing with my wife, pretend you don't know me.
Nathan Hale, sir.
"I regret that I have but one life to give to my country".
Correct.
And obviously the man never worked on a draft board.
- Another point for Radar.
- He's coming up on the outside.
When are you gonna get to capitals?
I know state capitals.
I'll show ya.
Ask me the capital of Cleveland.
Klinger.
"What famous Civil War hero said, 'Damn the torpedoes.
Full steam ahead'"?
And please try to answer with less than the seven basic ballet movements.
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.
"Tugarraf".
-  - "Tugarraf"?
- That's Farragut.
He said it backwards.
- Aha!
True or false.
You can reach the high notes of"The Star-Spangled Banner" by standing on your toes.
- That ain't part of the test.
- Yes, but how did you know?
He's cheating!
He's got the answers written all over him!
I am not.
Those are tattoos.
Leave me alone.
No wonder he knows history like the back of his hand.
- Let me say my capitals.
Dover, Delaware.
-  Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
Uh, New York, New York.
Major Burns has decided to make out his will.
Will you listen, Father?
Gracious, I didn't even know he was dying.
Oh, he isn't.
No.
It's just a precautionary measure.
Oh.
But he does have the fever and a person is supposed to be of sound mind.
Oh, it's okay, Father.
I don't think my mind was any sounder when I was well.
Call if you need anything, Major.
Uh, are you sure you feel up to this, Frank?
The only thing I really feel up to is dying.
I see.
Well, uh, if you're ready My car, my house, all the money I buried in my backyard goes to the only woman who ever really cared ever really understood my wife, Louise.
She'll have to thaw out the map.
It's inside some ground chuck in the basement freezer.
And my savings account passbook number is in the same bottle as my appendix.
Appendix.
Hmm.
- A-Anything else?
- For my children all profits from my prescription kickbacks.
These are recorded in my red ledger not the blue one that I show to the government.
And finally to Major Margaret Houlihan my friend, my comrade my little soldier I leave all my clothes.
I'm very proud of you, Radar.
- Me too, sir.
- I want you to have the best six days of your life.
- I'm ready for 'em, sir.
- Got plenty of cash?
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Clean clothes, toothbrush?
Oh, I'll buy a new one in Tokyo.
I broke mine last month.
Well, they have 'em there.
Are you sure, Frank?
- I haven't been in six days.
- I know.
I feel like my cork's going to pop.
- Wish me luck.
- Frank, it's only the latrine.
You're not a test pilot going up.
I'll be right outside if you need me.
His first trip?
His temperature was back to normal this morning.
- He owes his life to you two.
- I don't know if we can live with that.
First time in a big town, Radar?
- Yes, sir.
- Lots of girls there just waiting for soldiers.
-  - Ayoung man should know how to protect himself.
Oh, I'll be okay, sir.
I studied karate.
- Well, have a good time.
- Thank you very much, sir.
Hey, Frank, how's it going in there?
Well, I think that's about as clever as anything I've ever heard him say.
- Frank?
- Speak up, Frank or we'll nail that shut and send you home in it.
Can't a person have a little private?
I think he's broken the four-minute private.
- Terrific, Frank.
- Congratulations.
- How do you feel?
- Hey!
How about a salute here, soldier?
I'm still a major even though you can't see my clusters in this robe.
And put out that cigarette, field strip it and police the entire area!
- He's better.
- I feel great.
- Are you sure?
- First-rate, tip-top.
- Then would you step this way, please, Major?
- Oh.
Well, Margaret, what is it?
The next time you give your clothes away give 'em to somebody your own size!
- Frank, what happened?
- She hit me!
- Right on the chin.
- How'd she find it?
- Why'd she hit you?
- I don't know.
- Come on home, Frank.
- Yeah, with people who really love you.
- I almost died, you know.
- Well, we did our best, Frank.
Major Burns seems back in shape.
Here's an anonymous letter snitching on three nurses.
- That's our fault.
- We re-created a monster.
- Yep.
-  Colonel Potter?
- That's right.
- Got a package for you, sir.
Oh, hi.
- The charges.
- Charges?
"Drunk and disorderly"?
Radar, you've never been drunk before.
It sort of made me disorderly, sir.
You tried to drink the ink in a tattoo parlor?
"Swam 50 laps in an eight-foot bathhouse tub"?
- I'll look after this.
Thank you.
- Yes, Colonel.
Take care, Leonard!
Give my best to your wife.
Radar.
Radar.
Our soldier of the month.
How can we ever stay in the contest?
You're right.
I'd be tough to follow.
Hey, Sherm, do you know where a guy could get a drink around here?
This eye can't even wink.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
##    Major?
## -  - Major, ma'am?
- Major?
-  How dare you paw me!
- I didn't paw you.
I pawed your book!
- You're going on report!
- For what?
- For uncovering an officer's leg!
Ma'am, I never touched your leg!
Your leg was naked when I came in!
How dare you say "naked" to me!
- Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Stop staring at my leg!
I'm not!
I am!
Don't you wish you could all the time stare at it and touch it and feel it!
- Oh, no, ma'am.
- You don't find it attractive?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
It's a beautiful leg.
- You think so?
- It reminds me of my pony back home, only his hair's brown.
Out!
Get out!
Wait a minute!
Come back here!
- What do you want?
- Oh, yeah.
There's an ambulance coming in.
They want you to scrub.
- Don't touch that!
- Oh, gee.
- Just leave this tent exactly the way you found it.
- You got it.
Exactly!
##  - What do we got here, Radar?
- Road accident.
This country's a course in creative killing.
X rays here, Radar.
- Take him to X ray.
- Careful with him.
He may have busted ribs.
What have we got here?
More X rays.
- Right.
Follow him.
- Right femur here.
Looks like Saturday night at the speedway.
- Everything under control?
- So far.
-  Be careful.
- You sure know how to make a doctor crazy.
I may write you an obscene prescription.
Ankle fractured.
Gonna check for possible skull fracture.
We got knocked off the road by a tank, Doc.
- He just kept going.
- A clear case of crush and run.
It was one of ours.
We were going up north with Colonel Chaffey, and wham!
The tank crowds us right into an embankment.
How can Americans do that to each other?
Ever see Gone with the Wind?
I'll take care of that for him, Doc.
- He gets it when he goes.
Radar - Colonel Chaffey's bats about that gun.
He'll get a receipt for it.
It's S.O.P., soldier.
Okay, guys, let's move him out.
- Whatever you say, Commodore.
- Sirs.
Look out.
Nurse Plummer, report to the O.R. Nurse Plummer, please.
Nurse Gage to X ray.
Second post-op shift, please report at 0500 hours.
More people hurt by vehicles than anything else in battle.
That's a fact.
Let me know if this hurts.
I almost bought it that way in World War I. I was taking a nap on the side of a hill when I heard a low rumbling I took to be distant artillery.
I looked up just in time to roll out of the path of a breakaway portable latrine.
- They didn't really have those.
-  Absolutely.
America had the first armored men's room.
Right, Colonel?
You're a bigger liar than I am.
How's our colonel doing?
Broken ankle.
Reckon he'll have to rest up in the fort for a spell.
He came in totin' a six-shooter.
- Chrome, with a bone grip.
- The kind we used to sign Indian treaties with.
My Uncle Claude collected fancy guns.
He was cleaning them one day when his prized piece went off.
The bullet severed his foot, kept going across the room and killed the cat.
They buried Tabby in one shoe box and Uncle Claude's toe in another.
Really.
Isn't a G.I. -issue handgun enough for these army types?
If you like packing hardware, you're always looking for a unique weapon.
So you can play soldier while you're playing soldier.
My father wouldn't let me have any toy that even looked like a gun.
I was miserable till I discovered dolls.
I shot a bear once in the penny arcade.
I wanted to break through that glass and fix up his shoulder.
- Hawk, you were a sensitive child.
- Oh, yes.
I studied the violin till I beat up the teacher.
That hurt you yet?
I must be ready to get my license.
Attention, Major Burns.
Attention, Major Houlihan.
Together again.
Majors Burns and Houlihan to the compound, please.
If you liked them in the laundry room, you'll love them in the compound.
- Oops, sorry, dear.
- It's okay, honey.
Gimme that, you nut!
Frank, you've got to set an example.
Listen.
I was sound asleep, and suddenly there's all these wounded.
It's nearly midnight.
Why can't they fight from 9:00 to 6:00?
Maybe the next war, Frank.
Maybe the next.
Can you pray somewhere else, Father?
You're genuflecting right in the way.
I was only offering a bit of comfort.
I'll call you when it's time for kindness.
Okay.
Start an I.V. Two units of plasma.
Klinger!
Come on, pal.
Give me the gun.
You'll get it back, honest.
- What's the ruckus here?
- He won't let go of it, sir.
Oh, good for you, son.
A soldier's best friend is his gun.
You take care of it, and it'll take care of you.
- He's unconscious, sir.
- That's all right.
He understands.
Maybe if I was, I would.
- Did you call, ma'am?
- First litter.
Ward three.
Okay.
Chest, head injuries.
- Those are your best things.
- Oh.
- Coming through.
- Here.
Let me help.
- The gun bin's on my way.
- Thank you, sir.
- Move your can!
- What?
- Move your can, sir.
- I'll remember that, doggie breath.
This will just take a minute, sir.
It's all right.
I can't start till Pierce and Hunnicutt finish showing off in surgery.
You think you got enough keys there, Corporal?
Oh, I need 'em all, sir.
This one's to Colonel Potter's office.
This is oats for his horse.
Oh, this one's to my bike in Iowa.
Every time my sister borrows it, the chain slips.
What's that?
Yeah, how about that?
Ain't that something?
It's a gun, sir.
A colonel's gun.
It just came in tonight.
- Oh, that's an old beauty.
- Yes, sir.
Man, that feels good.
Perfectly balanced.
You better believe it, mister, or you're dead where you stand.
- Who's that supposed to be?
- John Wayne.
John Wayne?
He doesn't sound anything like you.
No, sir.
Oh, that's a dandy piece.
Yes, sirree, Bob, that's one shootin' iron.
I've, uh Better put her to bed, Corporal.
Yes, sir.
Shouldn't you be getting back to surgery, sir?
I'm sure in the dull part of the war.
How do you feel this morning, Colonel Chaffey?
Oh, about like you'd expect after losing an argument with a tank.
- We checked on your jeep.
- Flattened?
They're shipping it to your house and slipping it under the door.
You're in our "lucky to be alive" department.
- How about my men?
- Okay, give or take a few fractures.
Are you the one that fixed me up?
I just held the ball.
He did the punting.
I'd like to show you my appreciation.
Maybe you could end the war a day or two sooner.
We're not allowed to take cash.
I'll do my best.
Oh, hey, Doc, um, when I came in, I was wearing a gun a Colt.
45.
Not to worry.
The receipt for that gun is right in here.
Oh, thanks, Doc.
I wouldn't want to lose that baby.
We think of everything.
When you're ready we even stamp your hand, and you get right back into battle.
-  - Ah, who is it?
-  That "Major"person.
- Come in.
- Exercising?
- Yoga.
It's changing my whole life.
I feel so vital and alive!
You ought to try it.
Gets your blood moving.
I don't need it, you little Hindu.
I've got you.
Ahhh.
Roughneck.
Ow!
What is that?
Oh, sorry, sweets.
I forgot I was packing this.
How about these apples, huh?
Frank, it's gorgeous.
A Colt.
45.
Where did you get it?
Well, I've had it for years.
I finally sent for it.
I just missed my old pal.
Why don't you wear it as a regular side arm?
Oh, it looks smashing.
- Oh, it's not for every day.
- Instead of your service.
45.
Oh, wear it.
It's adorable!
No, I think I'll keep it under wraps for a while.
A-And don't say anything.
Everyone's jealous enough as it is.
Oh, I know.
What a surprise.
Who would have thought you had a revolver like old Dad?
Okay, let's see Just a sec.
Boy, sometimes it feels like they're flying in your ear and out the other.
Four-eight-three-three Here you go, guy.
Just like you left it.
- Thanks, Corporal.
- You're welcome.
Take care.
Holy moley.
!
What's Stars and Stripes have to say this morning, Colonel?
Eighty cadets were just expelled from West Point for cheating on their exams.
They should all be sentenced to this breakfast.
I'm sick of this powdered stuff.
Colonel, couldn't we once have fresh eggs?
Only if you can lay 'em.
Ask a foolish question Well, at least one of you still remembers his manners.
Not at all.
My shorts were just riding up on me.
Says here Eisenhower's spending a lot of time playing golf.
More fun than playing president.
- What's his handicap?
- A lot of people say Nixon.
- Colonel - That's me, Radar.
Sir, I have something to report that I wish I could do almost anything else instead of but which I guess I got no choice.
If you bring that sentence in for a fitting, I can have it shortened by Wednesday.
- One of the casualties, son?
- No, sir.
You know that Colonel Chaffey's gun the fancy job bone grips, shiny barrel?
Yes.
- It's gone.
- Stolen?
- It's out of the gun bin.
- Anybody but you handle the keys?
They never leave me.
I sleep with them.
- I shower with them.
- Rusty they'll never get.
- When did you see the gun last?
- Last night, Major Burns and I stored some rifles.
What are they staring at?
Don't worry.
From that angle, they can't see under the table.
He couldn't have taken it, sir.
We both left together.
Someone must have lifted your keys.
I never should have gone to sleep.
You can't stay awake for the duration, Radar.
Even MacArthur went to sleep.
Only when he was being given orders.
Radar, we'll turn the camp inside out.
If it's here, we'll find it.
We're not gonna let you spend Fifteen years, sir?
Well, that's what you can get for this.
I'll be in my 30s.
That's almost dead.
- Father.
- Colonel.
Is it possible to pray for a revolver?
A gun?
You want to pray for a gun?
- That's right.
- Is it at least American?
Thanks.
Colonel Chaffey?
I'm Colonel Potter, C.O. Of the hospital.
And a fine one it is, Colonel.
You've taken good care of a lot of my people.
We've got a pretty good life-and-limb shop here.
But I, for one, wouldn't mind going out of business.
- Lots of headaches?
- I've got one now that you may have to take an aspirin for.
Your gun is missing.
- Damn it!
I had a feeling that - Stolen from the gun bin.
- Well, have you searched the base?
- Thoroughly.
We've confiscated a ton of moonshine equipment a three-day-pass printing press and a cockfight training camp.
- But no gun.
- Not yet.
- Well, who was in charge of the gun bin?
- A corporal.
Corporal who?
What was the "non-com-poop's" name?
O'Reilly.
- I want him, Colonel.
- I'll get him.
Not the whole corporal.
Just his head on a platter!
Attention, all personnel.
Attention.
Tonight's movie is Kansas City Confidential.
This will be of special interest to anyone who missed it when it was shown every night this month.
- Hi, Frank.
- That's what you think.
- Got a minute, Frank?
- For what?
- Nothing really.
- Oh, you can have all that you want.
- No funny stuff.
- Us?
Frank!
Last time we were alone, you whitewashed my behind.
We've given up still lifes, Frank.
Take five, fellas.
What do you want?
If it's money, I'm strapped myself.
We know, Frank.
You're sending 11 nephews through ballet school.
- It isn't money.
- Good.
- It's about a gun.
- I haven't touched it.
- Touched what?
- The gun.
- Which gun?
- Whichever one you're talking about.
- Let us describe it.
- That's fair enough.
That way you'll know what you're talking about.
- That's not necessary for me.
- It helps us.
- Suit yourself.
-  - The gun.
- A collector's item.
- An old western six-shooter.
- The steel is chromed.
- With bone handles.
- Right.
- And I haven't seen it!
- Radar says you did.
That miserable little fink.
He's a dirty, rotten fibber!
It's congenital.
He's incapable of telling the truth.
- Radar is a fibber?
- That's right a born liar.
- Radar?
- Yes!
- He says you didn't take it.
- Well, why would he lie?
- Frank.
- What more do you want?
You've got his word against mine.
Frank, if that gun doesn't turn up Colonel Chaffey is gonna chuck Radar in the stockade.
I'm very fond of Radar, Frank.
He's both the child and pet I never had.
- What's that to me?
- Frank, we know how you appreciate guns.
Isn't it possible, if you saw a unique old weapon you might just want to borrow it for a while just to study it?
- That's not what happened!
- And you just couldn't get it back in time to get the heat off Radar?
Frank, don't make us get the whitewash.
- Radar is innocent until proven guilty.
Correct?
- Correct.
But he and only he seems to be entitled to that sort of consideration.
Correct?
Hah!
Don't you hate it when he's right?
Boy, you really got to watch out for yourself in the army.
I found that out, boy.
It's every man for himself.
- How many beers you had?
- One.
Take it easy, huh?
It's okay.
I know just when to throw up.
Yeah, in the service, you got to cover up your you know what or you'll get it kicked.
You'll get your rear end kicked right in the butt.
- You're telling me?
- You're probably the only guy who understands.
I don't know how I smile through the makeup.
I just hope whoever swiped that gun has a lot of fun with it.
I hope he has a lot of fun with it while I'm spending 15 years in the stockade.
- Ah, you ain't spending no fifteen years.
- Fifteen years!
By the time I get out, I'll be a hardened "crinimal".
Take it easy.
You're getting yourself all "morosed" up.
First they'll bust me, then they'll take away my stripes.
Do you know how proud I was to get them?
There's 400 kids in my old high school Ottumwa Central.
Ottumwa.
Give me an O. Give me a T-T-T.
When I made corporal after basic training I sent every one of them a picture of me in my stripes.
I sat in one of those four-for-a-quarter booths and took 400 pictures of myself.
It cost me 25 bucks, and I had to sit there for 16 hours.
But everyone got a picture.
And now they can just tear them up because my corporal days are over.
Fifteen years.
My earthworms will be dead and buried.
Things don't happen till they do.
You know?
Fifteen years!
I'm going to jail in my puberty and I won't come out till my adultery.
Attention, please.
Colonel Potter speaking.
The result of our search for the missing Colt.
45 has been one big goose egg.
The consequences can be serious.
If whoever stole the missing gun will give it back there will be no questions asked.
Your cooperation will be more than greatly appreciated.
Thank you.
Ahhh.
-  -  Rats!
These are probably for his dumb bicycle.
Excuse me, sir, Colonel.
What is it?
My name is Radar O'Reilly.
I'm the guy who had his picture taken for 16 hours for nothin' on account of your gun.
So you're the man responsible.
Yes, I am.
And I've got something to say no respect intended.
What do you need a gun like that for anyway?
Corporal, you're drunk.
You better believe it, mister, or I'm dead where you stand.
My bear went off!
Father, was that a shot I just heard?
It may have been.
It sounded like it.
But I don't want to start any unsubstantiated rumors.
- But that's the scuttlebutt.
- Thank you, Father.
-  - Who is it?
- It's me, Margaret.
Open this stupid door.
!
- Frank, what?
- I've been wounded, Margaret.
Help me.
- Frank, where?
In the foot.
I was cleaning my gun the Colt - and it accidentally went off.
- Frank, that's not your gun.
I was passing the supply room and I saw someone trying to put the colonel's gun back in the bin, and I jumped him.
We struggled, and he shot me!
Or they did.
He may have been more than one person.
- Careful.
- Okay, okay.
- Oh.
- It just nicked the side.
Well, it hurts, Margaret.
It may not look bad, but it's killing me.
I have a low threshold of pain.
A hemorrhoid can put me into a coma.
- Frank, you stole that Colt!
- Hmm?
I never!
It's just that I appreciate guns and it's a unique old weapon so I wanted to borrow it to study.
And then people misunderstood, so I put it back.
Only the key wouldn't fit, and it was dark.
You lied to me, Frank!
That's worse than stealing.
Well, I happen to think stealing is worse than lying.
- And you did both!
- So I ought to know.
Oh, my foot is throbbing, Margaret.
- Oh, all right.
I'll get some dressing.
- No, please, later.
Let it quiet down out there first.
Ohhh.
I did a terrible thing, Margaret.
Oh, it's all right now.
I should have known better.
- Well, at least you regret it.
- Oh, never again.
When you steal something, don't ever try to return it.
Corporal, I'm glad we were together when my gun was found.
Couldn't have proved better that you were guiltless.
And I didn't do it either, sir.
Colonel, as one old soldier to another, I'd lose that revolver.
- It's a troublemaker.
- What do you suggest?
Drop it in the sea.
Give it to a museum.
Put it under glass somewhere.
It's my gun.
I'll keep it till I die.
-  - And it won't surprise me a bit.
- Adios.
- So long.
- Feel better, Radar?
- Except for my hangover, sir.
Everything's all jumpy and blurry.
I didn't have a drink, and I got the same problem.
What's the matter, Frank?
Kick a brick under a derby?
Maybe the gout.
All that rich food.
Oh, it's, uh, an old football injury, if you must know.
- It acts up once in a while.
- I wouldn't use a bandage, Frank.
The powder burns will heal faster that way.
Well, of course they will.
I know that.
Powder burns?
What are you implying?
Nothing, Frank.
It was just a shot in the dark.
Check.
- Ah.

I don't know much about those, sir.
I could sing it much better if I didn't have this cold.
- Uh, mail call, sir.
- Who from, Radar?
Well, you got a letter from a Dr. Norman Chase, Cleveland, Ohio.
Oh, yeah.
Great proctologist good ol' Squint.
- Here's one from your son, sir.
- Oh, good.
- Read it while I rake these bristles.
- Yes, sir.
- I didn't know your son was a doctor.
- Dentist.
Specializes in gums.
I remember when we talked it over.
He said, "Dad, everybody's got two sets of gums.
That's where the money is".
"Dear Dad, things have been going great here "lots of pyorrhea.
"We are well, but hold on to your hat.
"Jeanine and I have been keeping a secret from you and Mom.
- By the time you get this, you'll be a grandfather".
- Yeow!
Wow!
Let's see, uh  "The baby's a week late, Dad".
- They're always late.
- What do they know?
"I say it's late, Dad, because it's a girl.
"Jeanine says it's late because it's a boy.
"We have a bet.
"If she's right, I buy her four retread tires for her Kaiser.
If I'm right, she serves my breakfast in bed for a week".
That'll put a kink in his colon.
Gee, sir, maybe we could have a bet like that.
You know, like a pool.
Dandy notion.
Day it's born.
- And the baby's weight.
- Boy or girl.
- For a buck?
- Good.
I say it's gonna be a strapping nine-pound boy born on the, uh, 21 st.
Twenty-first.
With a firm jaw aristocratic nose steely eyes but a little taller.
One moment.
Come in.
- Good morning.
- State your business, Corporal.
It's mail call, ma'am.
- You got a package, uh, from Frederick's of Hollywood.
- Frederick's?
You know, I went through Hollywood on the way here.
I think I saw James Cagney.
Mmm.
You sent my brother Nicky to the big house.
Hmm.
Cagney.
- Is there anything else?
- We're having a pool on the birth of a baby date, weight and sex, one dollar.
- I don't approve of gambling.
- It's Colonel Potter's grandchild.
Six and a half pounds, the 25th, boy.
Now scram!
Yes, ma'am.
Mmm.
Cagney.
Oh, Frank Burns, you Midwestern devil.
Oh, my.
It's from my sister Angelica.
- The saint?
- Oh, no, Radar.
She's a nun.
Well, they get promoted though, don't they?
Oh, it's a big step, Radar.
Sometimes it takes centuries.
- Father, do you mind if I ask you a religious question?
- Of course not.
When you get a letter from your sister the sister does she call you Father, brother or Lieutenant, Father?
She calls me by my given name Francis.
Oh, I'm sorry, Father.
That's all right, Radar.
I'm here to entertain the troops.
Wow!
Well.
- She's coaching girls' basketball.
- Oh?
Saint Mary's 42, visitors 28.
Saint Mary's 56, visitors 39.
Oh, my.
They whipped the pants off Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrows.
I better continue on my appointed rounds, Father.
- Mail call.
- What a sweet sound.
Like a canary with fresh newspapers.
All you got was the Crabapple Cove Courier.
Never underestimate the power of the press.
- It's from your wife.
- Mm-hmm.
- From your wife.
- Mm-hmm.
- From your wife.
- Uh-huh.
- And from Waggle Hunnicutt.
- My dog.
- Your dog?
- My wife does the actual writing.
Surely you jest.
- Dogs can't write.
- Are you kidding?
I once knew a Cocker Spaniel who covered the dog show over at the New York Times.
Oh, yeah.
He would have won the Pulitzer Prize but that was the year Joyce Kilmer wrote Trees.
Get this.
"Nathan Wicket leaves farm to donkey".
I knew them.
They were very close.
- Hey, the baby said a whole sentence.
-  What'd she say?
"Boo da be babba".
The kid is brilliant.
Peggy says it means, "I've had enough strained apricots and wish to take my nap now".
You didn't have to explain it.
Get this.
"Lyle Brown, local fisherman "suffers double hernia pulling in lobster traps.
"Eight lobsters escaped during the disaster.
Lyle told reporters, 'They haven't seen the last of me".
' - Hey, Frank's letter is open.
- Oh, yeah.
It was an accident.
I was boiling some water for Colonel Potter's tea while I was sorting mail, and it come open.
- Steam will do that.
- It was an accident.
Honest.
What did it accidentally say?
Are you kidding?
I'm no sneak.
- I'm not a spy.
- It's okay to be an American spy.
Right.
Good guys can do anything rotten.
- His wife wants a divorce.
- Oh, wow.
- Hey, this is big stuff, Radar.
- Yeah.
Some officer was passing through here.
Anyway, he meets Louise back home see, that's Mrs. Major Burns and he spills the beans about him and Major Houlihan.
- Frank will blow his brains out.
- If he can find a peashooter.
- Well, won't this make him happy?
- Mm-mmm.
No, now he's free to marry Major Houlihan.
Radar, Major Burns doesn't want to leave mommy.
There's a 10,000-mile umbilical cord between here and Indiana.
I don't understand that.
- The telephone company puts it on your bill.
- Oh.
What are you doing here in officers' country?
Just delivering the mail, sir.
Well, then deliver it and get lost, you little drip.
I was talking to the guys.
The guys.
The guys?
I am Major Burns.
This is Captain Pierce.
That is Captain Hunnicutt.
We are not guys.
- I thought I was.
- Get out!
Yes, sir.
You do not salute inside!
Just in case I don't see you outside, sir.
Blow!
- Why must you encourage him, huh?
- We like Radar, Frank.
- He's soft and cuddly.
- And almost housebroken.
How is he ever going to learn his place if you keep letting him think he's an equal, huh?
Tsk.
This letter is open.
- Humidity.
- Steam will do that.
- Everything okay at home, Frank?
- Uh, fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The, uh, crabgrass is in bloom and the cat had puppies.
Hmm.
The sardine cannery burned down.
"The last structure in town designed by Frank Lloyd Wright".
The paper say anything about snow?
Frank.
It came.
It came.
The fatigues from Hollywood.
- Oh, oh.
- You naughty thing.
- Not now, Margaret.
- I want to show it to you.
- I must use the phone.
- You have feathers in your hair.
- It's a scalp condition.
- Frank, what's wrong?
Something dreadful's happened.
I've got to call home.
Oh, Lord.
Is someone dying?
If only it was that unimportant.
Okay.
Sir, your daughter-in-law isn't at Mercy Hospital.
- Did you call my son's home?
- Yes, sir, but I just got his answering service.
They said, uh, "Leave your name and your gum condition".
- Try that Jewish hospital.
- What's the name, sir?
Uh, Holy Moses.
Something like that.
Is my call through to Indiana yet?
Not right now, sir.
I got another call going through to Ohio.
Don't give me any snottiness!
I'm not that old dimwit you work for.
The Ohio call's mine, Major.
Oh, sir.
L Aaah.
It's just a little joke with Radar here.
I'd watch that dimwit talk.
Your bulb's been out since I met you.
Definitely, sir.
Hello.
Yeah, Seoul?
Listen, try that Jewish hospital.
Uh, look under Moses.
- Would that be Bernie Moses, sir?
- No first name.
Sir, my call is awfully important.
I have a terrible problem at home.
You're gonna have a problem here if you don't stop shooting off your "bazoo".
- Yes, sir.
- Sir, your call's going through.
It's plain old Moses Memorial.
Hello?
Hello?
Colonel Sherman Potter here.
Calling from Korea.
Korea.
Where all the fun is.
- Is there a Jeanine Potter - Sir?
Oh, sorry.
Jeanine Potter registered there?
Maternity.
- No, no.
Potter, not Potash.
-  What?
I'll try it.
Thank you.
- They said try City General.
- Right.
City General.
That's where my son was born.
My wife went into labor the minute she heard Valentino died.
- Gee, I hope she's better now, sir.
- Coming along.
- Colonel Potter.
- What's the matter with you, Burns?
You act like you've got termites in your truss.
Hello?
Hello?
- Can I talk to you in your office, sir?
- Well, make it snappy.
I'm a grandfather and don't even know it.
All right, Burns, spit it out.
- It's, uh, my wife, sir.
- Speak up, Burns.
I've got to call home.
My wife's very upset.
She misses me terribly and-and wants a divorce.
She got another stallion in the paddock?
Oh, heaven forbid.
No, she worships the ground I walk on.
- Who told you that?
- My mother.
"Daring Robbery.
"Saturday night last, the home of Mr. And Mrs. Marshall Staggs "popular local welding team, was burglarized.
"The Staggs had driven over to Morgansville "to get new nipples for their acetylene tank.
"Stolen were the following items "Mr. Staggs's World War II discharge button "which was in the lapel of his synthetic banker's-gray flannel suit "Mrs. Staggs's entire collection of glass paperweights "including one, when shaken, produces a snowstorm falling on a coyote "poised to eat a woodpecker a set of porcelain his-and-her shavings mugs" Shavings mugs.
Shaving Shaving mug.
Shavings mug.
No, that "and several items of Mrs. Staggs's clothing".
Page, uh, four.
Here, here it is.
"A wetted silk cocktail frock "a synthetic camel's hair topcoat "three house dresses, four pairs of shoes "and Mrs. Staggs's wedding gown.
"Police Chief Baylor states 'I believe this to be the work of roving transvestites".
' And people say nothing exciting ever happens in Crabapple Cove.
Sir, I found your daughter-in-law.
She's at City General.
- What about the baby?
What is it?
- I can't get another line through for two hours.
There's only one operator on duty in Seoul because of the parade.
- What parade?
- Syngman Rhee was just elected dictator again.
- Keep after 'em, Radar.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, you're supposed to knock.
In my grief, do I know what I'm doing?
Colonel, do you want to see Corporal Klinger?
Might as well.
I probably won't be going to the Easter parade.
Don't upset him.
- What now, Klinger?
- Don't ask.
- Then shove off.
- Ask.
- All right, what is it?
- Tragedy has struck my family, sir.
- I have a letter here from my mother.
- And?
It is about the tragedy, sir.
Here is the tragedy.
My two brothers, Maurice and Hakim died in an explosion of the boiler at the Toledo Harmonica Company.
Two brothers?
That's rough.
- My heart's in pieces.
- Older brothers?
I was the baby.
Hakim would bathe me.
Maurice would nurse me.
So, according to the Selective Service Act subsection 31 -B paragraph six, small A, tragedy-wise as sole remaining son I'm entitled to immediate discharge from this the United States of America Army.
While you process it, I'll pack.
- Yo!
- Question, Sherm?
- Sherm?
- I was overcome by a wave of civilianism.
First of all, this is in your handwriting.
I translated my mother's letter, sir.
It was in Lebanese.
- Let me see it.
- I burned it.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's part of a religious ceremony.
Held when two brothers die in a harmonica factory.
Or a camel race.
Whatever.
Klinger, this is your personal record.
Yes, sir.
- You have no brothers.
- Whoever said that was lying.
- You said that.
- Right.
I was lying, sir.
They were in the country illegal.
Ah, they, they lived under the front porch.
We fed them through the cracks.
And now they're dead.
- Klinger, you've got to live before you die.
- Oh, you said a mouthful, sir.
And they never did.
You made this whole thing up.
- How can you tell?
- I know you.
Every time you tell a lie your nose gets smaller.
- Dismissed.
- I'll be back.
I'll be here.
- They're kidding.
- What?
"Chick Siddons reports the loss of several calves.
They weren't branded, but one of them was wearing a gray felt hat".
- A calf wearing a gray felt hat?
- Just for downtown.
Must you bore everyone with that dull, hometown news?
Dull?
Listen to this.
"Noel Coward, Cole Porter and Marlene Dietrich "were seen dining at Eddie's Bar and Grill on Route Six.
"Cole Porter was heard to say 'Eddie, this boiled catfish is a trip to the moon on gossamer wings".
' Oh, stop it!
Just stop it!
You know, when you're mad, you're ugly.
I heard that smirk!
How would you like to be confined to your bed for a week?
Anywhere she goes, I go with her.
Where's Frank, Margaret?
Still trying to call home?
- There's a crisis.
- Hurricane named Louise.
I'd love to tap into that conversation.
I'd like to be a mouse with earphones.
Oh, you'd just love to see me squirm, wouldn't you?
Can I slip into something comfy first?
- We're through to Indiana, Major.
- Well, it's about time!
- I went as fast as I could, sir.
- Oh, it's all right.
I'm very grateful, Corporal.
- I'm really not a bad person, you know?
- Yeah, I heard that once, sir.
I've got terrific pressures on me.
- Always have.
- Yes, sir.
My mother and father never got divorced.
I'd have done much better coming from a broken home.
-  - Ooh.
- Now what?
- It'll be just a minute, sir.
- Hey, Klinger, when am I gonna see my home movies?
- Ready when you are, C.B.
This is a private phone call.
Have you dug the new latrine?
Yes, sir.
It's beautiful.
A hole to remember.
Sir, your home phone is ringing.
Louise?
Louise, can you hear me?
Huh?
Well, it's me.
Frank.
- Frank Burns.
- Frank Burns.
Can you hold on a minute, sugar?
Huh?
Go peddle your fish!
His old lady heard about Major Houlihan, huh?
Yeah.
Just when he bought her some underwear you don't even need a girl for.
No kidding?
Come on.
Give me a hand with the projector.
Hey, watch it, will ya?
- Why my phone?
- Sir, I give so much and ask for so little.
My wife's on the phone right this minute and I'd like to talk to her privately.
All right.
All right.
Shake a leg.
- And don't get the phone all sweaty.
- I'll try, sir.
I'm back, Louise.
Right here.
Listen, sugar, I just got your letter and, honey, sugar, I can't believe it.
I just can't, you know, believe it.
Darling, you know that the moment I met you I lost all interest in women.
Now, Louise, please.
No, no, you must listen to me.
I don't care what your mother said.
I don't care what she told you about me.
No, no.
Now, please Huh?
Houlihan?
Well, we have a Major Houlihan.
But that's laughable.
I mean, hah.
Major Houlihan's an old war horse!
I don't care what Chuck told you!
Attractive?
Houlihan?
She looks like an Army mule with bosoms.
Well, not that I ever noticed.
Now, wait, wait, wait!
Louise?
Honey?
I can't live without you.
Oh If you divorce me, I'll do myself an injury.
I'll run right out into the middle of the war!
Oh, please!
Sugar.
Well, who wouldn't cry?
Jiminy Cricket.
Your picture's in my wallet, and I'm sitting on it.
And if that isn't love, I don't know what is.
That's my sugar.
Yes, yes, yes.
I'll write you a long letter right away.
And you get rid of that lawyer.
Oh, Louise.
Am I still in your father's will, huh?
Good.
Well, darling, they're gonna cut us off.
Yeah.
I love you, angel.
Only you.
War horse?
Army mule?
- Margaret.
- Stuff it!
Margaret!
I had to say those things.
Try to understand.
- Leave me alone, you chinless chipmunk!
- Margaret, please.
Remove your hand, or I'll zap you with my knee!
Margaret.
I had to lie.
The stocks and the house are in her name.
Margaret, dear, why don't I bring over my can of Sterno?
We can have some hot toddies, and you can put on your new nightie.
You put on my new nightie.
!
- Forty-five dollars.
- Sold.
Are alterations included?
Oh, go practice your putts.
What is this, Radar, "How to Make Vaseline in Combat"?
- It's a home movie, sir.
-  "How to Make Vaseline at Home.
" No, it's Sunday dinner at Ottumwa, Iowa.
My Uncle Ed took 'em.
- My mother's in there and everything.
- Ready to roll.
Everybody here?
Hawkeye, B. J., me, Klinger, Radar?
Let's go.
Oh, and Father Mulcahy.
I'm sorry.
That's quite all right.
I'm often mistaken for being absent.
-  Hey, focus it.
- I'm focusing.
That's my mother and my dog Ranger.
That's my Uncle David.
Oh, that's my cousin, uh, Millie and my Uncle Bill.
Hi.
I love you, Walter.
- Gee, Dad, talkies.
-  Who's Walter?
- That's my given name.
- Give it back.
What are they doing?
-  They're doing that 'cause I'm in the army.
-  Since when?
Radar, who's that man in the dark suit?
- That's my Uncle Bill.
-  Is he a clergyman?
Uh, he wanted to be, but he couldn't find a good corner.
-  Oh, look at that food.
!
-  Oh, chocolate cake.
!
- Yeah, my mom makes great chocolate cake.
-  Look at that milk.
I'd eat those flowers.
-  Lovely table.
-  What's in that bowl, Radar?
Oh, that fruit salad with those little marshmallows.
- What do they call that?
- That fruit salad with those little marshmallows.
- Right.
-  Quiet for the grace.
Thank you for the world so sweet, thank you for the food we eat.
Thank you for the birds that sing, thank you, God, for everything.
Lovely.
Oh, look at the buns.
!
Look at the buns.
!
-  Oh.
-  Yeah.
-  Did your mother make those?
- Yeah.
They smell great too.
-  I know.
I can smell them.
- This is my cousin Millie.
- She runs a charm school.
- Charm school?
No kidding.
A charm school and gas station.
Hey, watch this guy.
That's my Uncle David.
Watch him now.
Watch.
-  The one with the sense ofhumor.
- Yeah.
I told you about him.
He can do binoculars with corn on the cob salt and pepper shakers and toilet paper rolls.
A meal in itself.
That's my mom and Ranger again.
-  You know, you look a lot like Ranger.
- We grew up together.
Gee.
Oh, I think it's gonna rain.
Either that or it's a two-pound robin.
- What was that, sir?
- Later.
She's gonna put the flowers back in the ground.
That's my Aunt Emily too.
-  What's this?
- Oh, I think they're going in to listen to the radio.
-  Jack Benny.
- Fred Allen.
- Bishop Sheen.
- "The Shadow knows".
##  Bye, Uncle Dave.
Oh, there's my sled.
That's my cousin Jimmy.
Hejust started wearing those glasses.
Bye again, Ranger.
So long, Mrs. O'Reilly.
-  Nice pictures, Radar.
- Thank you, sir.
-  Radar?
-  I'll get it.
Radar certainly bears a striking resemblance to his mother.
Well, he is wearing her genes.
Sir, it's Ohio!
Your son!
Son, Dad.
Well, what's the big news?
The 23rd, 81/2 pounds.
And what's his name?
Cheryl?
Sherry?
My grandson's a girl.
Oh, heck no, I'm not disappointed.
How's Jeanine?
You give that soldier a big kiss.
Is Mother pleased?
Oh, can I talk Oh, phooey.
- You too?
- I lost the baby pool.
- Bless my soul.
I won.
- A little inside information, Father?
No, not at all.
I just know a little bit more about conceptions.
Lieutenant Kellye, that cigar is you.
To Sherry Pershing Potter, my granddaughter.
- A long and happy hitch.
-  Hear!
Hear!
Here we go.
Reinforcements, Colonel Grandpa.
Klinger, where'd you get that negligee?
- I found it in the garbage.
- War is such a waste.
Klinger, it's you.
# Let me call you sweetheart #  # I'm in love with you ##
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
The camp's just crawling.
Who's insect officer?
- I am, Colonel.
- He forgot to wear his wings today.
We're up to our butts in larvae.
The Empire State Building was sold yesterday for $20 million.
Does that price include King Kong?
He wasn't a real ape-person, you know.
They used a model.
- Fay Wray's real.
- Luckily, she's only six inches tall.
- Good little actress.
- You sirs mind if I sit here?
You're very democratic, Radar.
Hey, there's a fly in my coffee.
- Probably knows you're insect officer.
- Look at him.
- He's doing the Australian crawl.
- Go Yale!
- Radar, is that tomato juice?
- This red stuff, yes, sir.
I haven't seen tomato juice in donkey's years.
Reminds me of all the goodies back home.
- Kosher pickles.
- Apple pancakes.
- Escargot.
- What's that?
- Snails.
- Oh, ick.
I would never eat a snail.
Nobody would.
That's why they started to call them escargot.
Would you like this juice, sir?
My lips never touched the glass.
- No, I'll get some.
- Oh, please, sir.
Take mine.
- You're very kind, Radar.
- Well, it's nice being kind to you, sir.
You know, as captain, I have the power to marry you two.
Dee-lish.
Boy, that takes me back.
Last time I had tomato juice was when I was stationed at Camp Dix.
Mother and I had a house on the base.
It was peacetime.
All I did was take out the odd hot appendix and teach dirty words to our mynah bird.
- Rats!
- What?
- My fly sank.
- If he doesn't come up in ten seconds, I'm going in after him.
Ahhh.
Thank you, Radar.
That tomato juice was the oyster's ice skates.
- You're welcome, sir.
- If anybody needs me, I'll be sending a latrinogram.
- Did you read the news?
- Years ago.
- Thank you.
Thanks again, Radar.
- Yes, sir.
- Shall we?
- Radar, we'll be in post-op.
Bill this to my room.
I'm in the cesspool suite.
And tell the cook I'll get him if it takes a lifetime.
What do they want from me?
I just serve this barf.
Hey, Klinger, do me a favor?
It's Lebanese.
It means, "If I fail my brother, may my camel lose his hump".
- What do you want?
- Colonel Potter flipped over that tomato juice.
- You wanna make sure he gets it every morning?
- No chance.
The juice was a fluke.
We got a can by mistake.
It mostly goes to the brass in the rear.
Helps them from getting too depressed going to the P.X. All the time.
Maybe I could get the requisition officer to order some.
Our requisition officer?
This spillage is wasteful, soldier.
- Yes, sir.
- You're losing half your applesauce.
- Apples don't grow on trees, you know.
- Oh, no, sir.
- What's your name, fella?
- Maxwell, sir.
You're going on K.P., Maxwell.
I am on K.P., sir.
Well, the minute you come off, you're going on.
- Uh, excuse me, sirs.
- Did you bring any fresh flies with you, Radar?
- Uh, no.
Listen, you both like Colonel Potter, right?
- Very much.
I worship his saddle sores.
- Taking a survey?
- Uh, no.
It's just that I like him too - and there's something I want to do for him.
- Very nice.
You do that, Radar.
Just remember, no good deed ever goes unpunished.
- Huh?
- What do you have in mind, doing-something-for-him-wise?
Well, I want to make sure that he gets tomato juice every morning except Major Burns is in charge of requisition, and I know he'll say no.
Major Burns is not very long on human kindness.
Major Burns wouldn't give a drowning man a glass of water.
- Should you give a drowning man - Major Burns has no heart.
I tried giving him a cardiograph, and it spelled out l-O-U.
- Well, would you guys please talk to him, sirs?
- Done, Radar.
Boy, I bet if my little brother had lived, he'd have grown up to be you two.
That's a pretty neat trick.
- What's your hurry, Father?
- Oh, I like to get in and get out fast.
- Give the next fellow a chance.
- Oh, take your time.
The nurses certainly do.
Just stand in here and soap their precious bodies all over from top to bottom.
Yes.
Well.
Oh!
This cold water is a blessing.
Ah, everyone worth knowing is visiting the baths.
- All of Rome is here.
No offense, Father.
- Be out in a tick.
- Just don't leave it in there.
- Frank, how'd you like to do us a favor?
- Take your favor and stick it in your jumper.
- Oh, dear.
Father, these two aren't entitled to any civility.
They stuff lard in my gun belt.
They keep writing nasty things on my shorts.
We like to send threatening underwear.
- Frank, this favor is for Colonel Potter.
- Oh, him.
- Our commanding officer, Frank.
- Your commanding officer, Skeezix not mine.
Last month he said my brain had a charley horse.
"Kick him in the shins," he said.
Give Frank a headache.
He's got no sensitivity for people's feelings.
He said it right in front of two enlisted creeps.
He was making a joke, Frank.
My brain is no joke.
- Hold still, Frank.
- Hmm?
- Did you get it?
- Get what?
Potter's crazy about tomato juice.
We'd like you to requisition some.
Not on your Nelly.
It's too expensive.
Each month I've only got so much to spend.
Frank, stop trying to bring the war in under budget.
You're gonna win the Distinguished Stingy Cross.
I hope you can see your way clear, Frank.
I think the world of Colonel Potter.
He's a good Christian, yet hardly dull at all.
Well, Frank?
- Is that a smile?
- It's so hard to tell when a man has no lips.
You can have your tomato juice on one condition.
-  What's that?
- I need a pair of nylons.
A pair of nylons?
- Varicose veins?
- They're not for me.
- Of course not.
- And they're not for her either.
- What her is that, Frank?
- They're for, uh one of the nurses who's performed well in the O.R. Why haven't I ever thought of taking one in there?
- We get you the nylons, Potter gets the juice?
- That's it, shorty.
Frank, how can we ever thank you?
Now, come on.
Get out!
Out!
Get out of here you crazy Stop that!
That is not funny at all!
#When I hear that Serenade in Blue # - # I'm somewhere in another world alone with you ## - Hey, Klinger, you got a minute?
Where would I get a minute?
I'm up at dawn hauling patients in and out of the O.R. Then it's over to the hospital, where I know every bedpan by its first name.
Then it's sentry duty.
Over to the kitchen to peel a few hundred potatoes just for laughs.
When am I supposed to rinse out a few things, set my hair, iron a dress?
- It's really rough on a guy.
- Who cares?
Nobody cares.
You can bet MacArthur doesn't have to rinse out his own nylons.
- How much you want for those?
- Forget it.
That's my lucky pair.
- Come on.
- I'm not kidding.
They belonged to my Uncle Bob.
- He wore 'em to get out of the navy in World War II.
- We need 'em for Colonel Potter.
- I need them for my freedom.
- We'll get you a little freedom.
- We will?
- Two-day pass down in Seoul.
Two whole days.
That's a stocking a day.
You know, you're a very persuasive person.
You'd have made a terrific hood.
- I'm still young yet.
- Sir, first the pass.
- Are you in, sir?
- Wouldn't surprise me at all, Radar.
Uh, sir, I got some stuff here for you to sign.
If you'll just sign it fast, it'll only hurt a minute.
I can't tell you how many times I've written my signature in the service.
Next camp I get, I put in my wife's name.
No need for glasses, sir.
This is just, uh, routine.
- Just need to replace some sutures and - Mm-hmm.
Some, uh, thermometers that got sat on.
- Mm-hmm.
- Nothing important.
What's this?
Uh, which "this" is that, sir?
Two-day pass for Corporal Klinger?
Why?
- Uh, "why"?
- I asked first.
- Uh, well, he put in for one, sir.
- It's ridiculous.
He's gone AWOL four times this month.
He's forever digging, wriggling, flying, sidling, tunneling out of here.
A pass?
He needs a pass to get into the place.
Uh, he's really pooped, sir.
He's worn out to a frazzle.
No, I just got an order from General Barker.
Seoul's crawling with V.I.P.s.
It's election time back home.
There are a lot of congressmen here to check on how to improve conditions at cocktail parties.
Ah.
"All forward units are ordered to restrict recreational leaves indefinitely".
Aw, poor Klinger.
- He's in bad shape?
- I think he's ready to bite a tank, sir.
Okay.
Get me General Bradley Barker in Seoul.
Gee, sir, you sure know how to take care of your people.
I've got a soft spot for Klinger.
He looks a little like my son and he dresses a lot like my wife.
- I'll get you - Get me General Bradley Barker in Seoul, Radar.
Barker.
General Bradley Barker.
General Bradley Barker.
Bradley.
General Bradley Barker.
Bradley Barker.
Hi, Sparky?
Uh, yeah, it's Radar.
Listen, Sparky, um, my boss wants General Bradley Barker at, uh, I Corps H.Q. Right.
I'll hold.
Hey, listen, uh, Sparky?
Thanks a lot for that book you sent me, that, uh, Fanny Hill.
Oh, yeah.
It was great.
The only thing is by the time it got to me, the last chapter was torn out.
I don't know how it ended.
Who did it?
Everybody?
Hot "churokees".
Oh, you got him?
Okay.
Hold on.
It's General Barker, sir.
Uh, it's his aide, Major Mills.
Uh, the colonel's ready for the general, Major.
- The major's got the general, Colonel.
- Brad?
Sherman Potter.
Fine.
Fine.
She's fine too.
How's your lovely bride?
Woman's got such a crepey neck, every Thanksgiving she's in danger of being stuffed.
Listen, Brad, I've got a small favor to ask.
I'd like to send a corporal down to Seoul for a couple of days and I'd like your people to stay off his back.
He needs a little rest.
Bug house, you know.
Like you were in Heidelberg slipping into that S.S. Uniform every night.
This guy puts on ladies' dresses.
Hmm?
No, he's not pretty.
Corporal Klinger's his name, and I'm very grateful, Brad.
Thank you.
What?
Yes.
Major Houlihan?
Margaret Houlihan?
She's still here.
Yes.
When?
For this weekend?
Well, I'll ask her, Brad.
I certainly will ask her.
I'll let you know.
Right.
Bye, Brad.
General Barker wants Major Houlihan to be his guest for the weekend down in Seoul - and he wants me to arrange it, Radar.
- Yes, sir.
If it works out, maybe I'll get myself a few majors and go into business.
I'm delighted you asked especially for me, sir.
I'm always ready to assist you.
Leg wound.
Just a superficial laceration.
We won't be long.
Oh, I don't mind, Colonel.
I'm completely devoted to my work and consider it a privilege to sacrifice my free time without making any mention of it.
- Clamp.
- Clamp.
I really had something to ask you, Major, but I don't know if I will now.
Sponge.
- What is it, sir?
- I talked to Seoul before and I'm really doing a slow burn about it.
- To whom were you talking, sir?
- General Barker.
Brad Barker?
- General Bradley Barker, sir?
- Right.
- I served under him at Fort Ord.
- Suction.
What did the general want, sir?
He had the gall to ask me to fix him up with you.
Fix him up with me?
This weekend down in Seoul.
Some big social do.
- Really?
- Said he'd send his car for you.
- Really?
- A reception.
Lots of V.I.P. S - wall-to-wall brass.
- Really?
He didn't have the guts to ask you direct, so he goes through me, the C.O. And figures I'll come crawling on all fours.
I'll call him back and tell him to take his soiree and stuff it.
- Oh, no, sir.
Don't do that.
- Lap sponge.
- Don't trouble yourself.
- It'll be my pleasure.
No, Colonel, really, please.
I'm willing to go.
- Major, you don't have to.
- I know.
Nothing bores me more than a crowd of generals and correspondents from all over the world.
Diplomats just standing around, sipping champagne especially when I could be here helping you drain the puss out of a leg.
But who knows?
My presence there might just help the 4077.
Won't mean a thing to us.
We don't need 'em.
I might be able to borrow some plasma beg some blankets, some instruments.
Don't beg 'em for anything.
Sutures.
I'll do it, sir.
I'll do it for the good of the outfit.
You're one hell of a gal.
Not at all.
I'll get some nurse to cover for me, run a quick comb through my hair.
You call Brad General what's-his-name.
Go over the top, soldier.
But why go into Seoul now?
If you wait a couple of weeks, we can go together.
Because I have a chance to go this weekend.
I just don't know why you want to go alone and not with me.
Look, I can go alone and then with you.
It doesn't make any difference.
You're certainly anxious to get out of here.
Frank, do you think I want to go?
It's hospital business.
I'm doing it for the 4077 th.
Doing what for the 4077 th?
Getting supplies.
General Barker has suddenly called me to a meeting.
General Barker?
Isn't he the one that once asked you to spank him?
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?
Well, I know two General Barkers.
- And this one called you to a supply meeting tonight.
- That's right.
- A night meeting?
- Don't ask me why.
- Will there be refreshments?
- Probably.
- Why are you taking your pumps?
- Why?
How do I know?
There might be dancing.
A dancing meeting?
Why not, Frank?
I mean, we're not machines.
A night dancing meeting to discuss supplies?
I'm warning you, Margaret, this is the last time you use my heart as a bath mat.
I'm groveling to you to let me keep my self-respect.
Don't go, Margaret.
Oh, Frank.
Stop sniveling.
You have seen my last snivel.
- Let's hope so.
- Are you trying to scare me, lady?
- I don't have to scare you, Frank.
- And I don't need this.
- I'm a happily married man, you know.
- Frank!
Oh, Frank.
- Major Burns, sir.
- Out of my way, or I'll grind you into the ground.
- I've got something to show you.
- Out, or I'll have your guts for garters.
- But this is something you wanted.
- You know what I want?
I want you to go away.
I want Korea to go away.
I want to wake up tomorrow morning in my own bed with my wife sleeping on her side, with her schnauzer between us.
We'd all like that, sir.
- But, Major, in the meantime I got you your stockings.
- My stockings?
Your nylons, sir.
Don't you remember?
You said if you got 'em, you'd order the tomato juice for Colonel Potter.
If your precious colonel, who is such a doddering old fool he practically has to be glued to the latrine so he doesn't fall off has to have his precious juice stick two tomatoes in his mouth, take him down to the motor pool and press his head in a vise!
- What makes him so rotten?
- In Frank's case, it's a gift.
He has raised selfishness and pettiness to an art.
- Aaah!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
- Sure.
Sure.
- He made a deal, though.
- I mean, that's not fair.
- Radar, what's "fair"?
- Being 20,000 miles from home?
- Up Korea without a paddle?
- I'm so lonely I could kiss a gopher.
- I think I just did.
-  - What does Major Burns see in Major Houlihan anyway?
- Mainly she's here.
- While Mrs. Burns is back in Indiana teaching Frigid One and Two.
- I wish you guys talked English.
-   They're all they've got, Radar.
Two kind of beat-up people, who, when they get together, barely have one heart between them.
What young Radar needs is for old Margaret to remain here in camp which would allow middle-aged Frank to give her the nylons which, in turn, would result in Colonel Potter's getting the tomato juice.
- Which will never happen.
- Careful, Radar you are throwing down the gauntlet of challenge before Hawkeye Pierce a man raised on the legend of Prince Valiant.
You have an actual idea, Prince?
No, but I'm not letting Radar down.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- He's been like a son to me ever since I found him hungry and cold, half-buried in a box of kitty litter.
He didn't really.
-  - What the hell is that?
-  - Coming, driver.
One moment.
- What do you want?
- Uh - What is this?
- Flowers, ma'am.
I can see they're flowers, Corporal.
I've been to the country.
Well, whoever give 'em to me says, "Give these to Major Houlihan the most marvelous person in the whole camp".
- Anemones.
- Yeah, but he wants to be friends now.
Put them in some water for me, will you, Corporal?
- Yes, I will, ma'am.
- Hasn't a staff car arrived for me yet?
- A staff car, ma'am?
- Yes.
A general's car.
It's picking me up.
A general's car.
- A car with stars.
- A stars car.
No, it hasn't arrived yet, ma'am.
Aren't you gonna read the note?
- What?
- There's a note with words on it.
Oh.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Oh, my heavens, yes.
- I was told to wait for an answer, ma'am.
- Oh, yes, yes.
Uh, take this to, uh, the flower person right away, Corporal.
- Good news, ma'am?
- Good news?
Yes.
Hurry.
Go on.
Go.
Get him.
##  ## So don't waste any compassion on me, soldier.
If you say so, sir.
Devotion, trust, faithfulness.
These are all wonderful qualities.
Only, be careful on whom you bestow them to because of the old double cross.
- You understand?
- I'm doing my best, sir.
Well, take me.
Always leading with my heart - wading in with my mitts down - And getting hit in the choppers.
- Let me finish my sentence, okay, soldier?
- Sorry, sir.
And always getting hit below the belt.
That's worse than the choppers.
- Uh, Major Burns, sir.
- What is it, Corporal?
Can't I enjoy a little misery in peace?
I'm sorry, sir.
I thought you might be interested in knowing I just crossed the compound - I have no interested in the compound.
- He has no compound interest.
- It's just Major Houlihan told me to give you this note.
- Give me that!
Oh, this is wonderful.
- Wonderful!
- Good news, sir?
- "Good news"?
- While everything is so wonderful and good, sir - would you please sign this requisition?
- Of course.
Of course.
Don't sell romance short, fella.
Have faith.
The drinks are on me, everybody!
He's crazier than I am.
He's a major.
-  -  Margaret.
Come in.
- Frank, darling.
- My precious girl.
You didn't have to do it again.
- Again?
- Wildflowers from my favorite wild fella.
Oh, Frank.
I'm so proud of you.
So proud of your courage.
Well, courage is just something you can't be afraid to have.
You have a golden tongue.
Margaret, I'm so grateful to you.
- "Grateful"?
- For not leaving me tonight.
For not leaving you forever.
Of course.
Forever.
All the way to the end of that.
All the way.
Like in the note it said.
"Yours tonight and always.
Margaret".
"Let me come to you on my knees to propose.
Frank".
Frank who?
Oh, "Frank who"?
Frank you.
- Margaret, dear.
- Yes, darling?
Well, no kidding.
Who else do you know named Frank?
-  - I'm here for General Barker.
- All right.
- Where can I find a Major Houlihan?
You sit tight.
We deliver.
- Have a good time, Major.
- We'll look after the nurses for you.
Here you are, Major.
Why do I feel like we're the ugly sisters?
- It can't be.
- What's that, Sergeant?
She looks like she needs a shave.
She's been on duty all day.
It says here the population back home is up above 150 million.
Where are they gonna put all of'em?
- America may have to open a branch country.
- What do you think Korea is?
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, Radar.
- Here you go, sir.
- No thanks, Radar.
The country just can't handle that many.
- Sir?
- Having babies is fun but babies grow up into people.
- Sir, that's tomato juice.
- I know it's tomato juice.
Anybody want it?
- Don't you want it?
- Don't you love it?
I do, but it doesn't love me.
I forgot I was allergic to it.
Last glass you gave me, I woke up in the middle of the night with my nose stuffed to the rafters Iooking like I was wearing someone else's face.
I can't touch the stuff.
And it's got a fly in it.
That was a generous and thoughtful gesture, Radar.
- I appreciate it.
- But it was all for nothing, sir.
Kindness is never for nothing, son.
- Only the next time you want to give me a surprise, - I'll tell you what it is.
- Tell me what it is first.
-  - Colonel Potter.
- Yes.
General Barker sends his compliments, sir.
- He thanks you for Corporal Klinger's company.
- Thank you, Sergeant.
Great guy, the general.
We had a million laughs.
- General Barker?
- Yes, sir.
- He saved from a senator who couldn't keep his hands off me.
- Really?
It's like I always say, "The bigger they are, the nicer they are".
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
"Dear Ma.
This is your boy here again "still fine with the U.S. Army in South Korea "and hoping you are the same.
"As usual, I am writing real slow, 'cause I know you can't read fast.
"Your package and letter arrived this morning.
"The cake and cookies and the underwear were all delicious.
"I was sorry to hear Uncle Ed went off the wagon on his hunting trip.
"I sure hope he'll be able to play the pump organ without those toes.
"I apologize for not answering sooner before, Ma.
"It's just I do a heck of a lot of writing in my job here.
"I got about the smallest pencil in the camp.
"Take like last week.
Top of all my other duties "which I got too many already I had to help Captain Pierce give everybody a monthly foot inspection".
- Terrific-looking toes, Colonel.
- Thank you, Pierce.
- Have you ever thought of studying piano?
-  N-Not there, Pierce!
- Should I write down ticklish, Captain?
- No, no.
Merely indicates the patient is highly oversexed, right, Colonel?
- How do they look, Pierce?
- You have the feet of a teenager.
Now we know why Mrs. Potter's smiling in her picture.
Learned about foot care in World War One.
From Capt.
Harry S. Truman, no less.
He had a great pair of feet.
Imprints of which may be seen on Gen.
MacArthur's backside.
- Colonel gets a hundred percent, Radar.
- Oh, good.
That's very good, sir.
A hundred percent!
Well, good feet run in my family, except for my Uncle Ben.
He had two extra toes.
Used to have to make little leather sidecars for his shoes.
Thank you, Colonel.
Come along, Robin.
"Colonel Potter, who I was really worried would I like, I really do.
"He's okay and a good egg.
"I think he's how Pop would've been if he hadn't died when I was little.
"I never told you, but it used to make me mad that Pop died "until I finally realized dying wasn't his idea.
"Another one of my jobs is helping patients go to other hospitals "or back to their units after we finish with their surgery and stuff.
"Corporal Klinger was helping evac the other night.
You'd like Klinger, Ma.
He looks a little bit like Aunt Jean before electrolysis.
" - Asher, Harold.
Private.
- Asher, Private.
Right.
Have a good ride.
We don't want to see you back here again.
- So keep down low.
- How goes the psycho business, Klinger?
I wrote General Ridgway I love him, and asked him to be my husband.
-  You mad thing.
- His aide wrote back.
- The general's happily married.
- Maybe they'll have a fight.
- Yeah.
-  Attention.
Attention post-op personnel.
The evac bus is loading and ready to go.
All aboard, whoever's leaving.
Hey, Doc.
Sergeant Callan.
You know.
You took the shrapnel out of my chest.
- I've got it pressed in my memory book.
- You got a second, Doc?
- You feel all right?
- I feel fine.
It's the wife, Doc.
She's not so hot.
She's gotta have an operation you know, woman stuff.
I studied "Woman Stuff" One and Two.
My problem is loot.
I don't have enough for the operation - and she's gotta have it right away.
- Uh-huh.
- I wonder if you could help me.
- I'll be glad to operate on her free - if they'll let me fly home.
- If I could just get her some cash.
I never lend my patients money.
Reduced life spans.
This watch cost me $150 at the Tokyo P.X. - Give me what you want for it.
- I got a watch!
- Thirty dollars and it's yours.
-  All full up!
Ready to roll!
It's self-winding, tells you the date.
Twenty dollars!
- S-Sergeant - It's a $150 watch!
- Look, Ser - I wouldn't do this if it weren't for my wife's plumbing.
- L - Take it.
Fifteen.
Take it.
Here, is, uh Twenty bucks is all I got.
- God bless, you, sir.
God bless you.
- You're welcome, Sergeant.
Good evening, sir.
I'm with the Department of Water and Power.
- I'm here to read your feet.
- Ah!
If you'll just step into my crate - What's that, a new watch?
- Yeah.
Got it off a patient.
Twenty bucks!
Goes for 150.
- The patient had to send the money home, right?
- How'd you know?
His kid outgrew his tonsils and needs a set of new ones?
The cat needs a "whiskerectomy"?
- I got taken?
- We gotta do something about that apple-pie-and-hot-dog face.
No works.
It's empty!
See, what you got there is either a pill box with hands or a lunch pail for Munchkins!
- I feel like an idiot.
- Go with the feeling.
- And I operated on that guy's chest!
-  See, what we'll do is we'll get the guy - and we'll put the shrapnel back in!
- You're a lot of help.
- You ready, sir?
- That's a loaded question, Radar.
It's past time to go check Major Houlihan's feet.
Ah, yes!
The major's clustered tootsies.
You think she'll believe it that a kiss on the instep improves circulation?
- I believed this was a watch.
- I'll do you at 9:00.
- How will I know?
- Lead on, MacDuff.
Who?
You better be prepared to explain that.
Want to buy a watch?
Major Houlihan's tent.
Ah, if this canvas could only talk.
-  - Major?
- Who is it?
- Time to have your feet "Pierced".
- Later.
- Sorry, Major, there's no later.
The future's been cancelled by the War Department.
They're just gonna replay the past.
She's not alone.
Give me two guesses.
Senator McCarthy?
Martin Bormann?
- Major Burns.
- I was right!
Come in.
- Hello, Frank.
- I was just leaving!
- That's gonna be difficult, isn't it?
- Huh?
- You tied your boot to the table.
- Oh, sure.
You were supposed to inspect my feet this morning.
Sorry, there was a parade on 5th Avenue.
The Sons and Daughters of Mickey Rooney.
Stick around, Frank.
I'll do you after Margaret.
I wouldn't let you touch my feet with a ten-foot pole!
Radar, cancel the ten-foot pole.
"Stretch" Pulaski tallest Pole you ever saw.
Thanks for letting me come by only to pick up the manual, Major.
The manual.
You kids still using the manual?
I think you could throw away the book by now.
Oh, watch your mouth in front of the help.
Can we get on with it?
Take it easy, Major.
Your feet aren't going anywhere without you.
- Ready, Radar?
- Uh, ready, sir.
Now, then, madame, what did you have in mind?
A pump?
A sandal?
A back-to-school shoe?
Doctor, I have a dozen specimens waiting for me in the lab.
You were smart to call ahead.
Report on Houlihan, Margaret, Major.
By Pierce, B.F., Captain.
I'm getting a little crazy, backwards, talking.
Isn't that a pretty foot, Corporal?
I wouldn't know, sir.
I'm not a doctor.
However, a wee bit of fungus two bunions, one corn, light on the mayo, hold the chili and onions.
Ankle's a bit swollen.
You retaining water?
My water is none of your affair.
Radar, get me some potassium permanganate for the major's feet.
I'll spread it on for you.
It's more fungus that way.
- Don't you wish.
- Uh, well, sir, I'll meet you at the next feet.
No, no, Radar, stay.
The law requires that a third person be present when I'm examining feet of the female sex.
Violation could result in my death by hangnail.
Oh, take your pan and get out!
Bossy boots.
"It's later now than it was before, Ma "and I'm having a cup of coffee in the mess tent.
"Colonel Potter has them make it real strong.
"He says it grows hair on your saddle horn.
Speaking of where I am, a really weird thing happened in here the other day".
Grits.
Peas.
Corn.
Potatoes.
Ham.
- Boy, you think of everything.
- That's why I get the big money.
Next!
- Anyone sitting here?
- No.
No one.
I forgot to put coffee in my cup.
Boy, you must be starved, guy.
Hey!
What funny printing on there.
All the R's and the P's are backwards.
Wow!
That's a Russian gun.
- You lucky pup!
That's a great souvenir.
-  All I got so far is a small ivory Jesus for my mama's car.
Yeah, he's tops in our religion, you know.
Boy, I'd give anything for one of these Russian babies.
I didn't mean anything.
Hey.
!
- Hey!
Wait a minute!
-  - You ignatz!
- Sir, there was just a Korean in here.
This country is crawling with Koreans.
You can't swing a dead cat without hitting a Korean.
You're going on report for this, you little puke!
- Can I help, sir?
- You keep out of this, bugle beak!
I spent an hour going over this shirt with a hot rock.
Sir, it was a North Korean!
I didn't realize until after he left!
He had a Russian gun and everything.
A commie?
In here?
Sometimes they do that.
Their snipers get hungry.
After shooting at our guys, they got the guts to eat our grits?
And you let him get away, you little pantywaist!
If I'd have been here, I'd have given him a good thrashing!
- Sir, they know judo!
- Religion has nothing to do with it.
Better not try it again.
He'll probably keep the tray too.
"Monday night, Colonel Potter and Major Houlihan "went into Kha Doc, which is a native village.
"We go once a month to treat the sick, old and ill.
"I could've gone, but last time I went, they served grasshoppers and rice.
"I don't mind that, but the sauce made me sick.
I think it's Mexican.
" - Well, I guess that's about it.
Radar?
- Yes, sir?
- Everything's gonna run smooth - Make sure everything runs smooth until I get back.
- You got everything, sir?
- Blankets, medical supplies, ketchup for the grasshoppers.
-  - Keep the whitewash away from Major Burns.
I don't want to see one painted rock when I come back.
And make sure no one goes into my tent.
- I wouldn't do that, ma'am.
- Somebody does.
- Maybe it's rats.
- You think rats have been trying on my undies?
Some of them rats are weird.
You be careful on the road now, sir.
- We've got reports of snipers.
- Can't kill a regular army man.
Head's too thick.
Yo-o!
Corporal O'Reilly, please answer your phone.
- Corporal O'Reilly, your phone's running over.
- I'll take the whitewash, sir.
- He said no?
- He said no.
Ah, Frank.
Just in time for your foot inspection.
- I'm short ten toes, and they're yours.
- Forget it, twerp!
Watch it, Frank.
I read lips.
Gee, Mrs. Potter.
You just missed him.
Uh, yes, ma'am.
He just drove off with a nurse to a village near here.
Oh, no, he's okay.
No, honest!
Yes, ma'am, you could call him tomorrow and ask him yourself.
Hey, uh, how's things in Missouri?
What?
I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't hear you.
There's too much static on the Oh, it's okay.
No, even static from home sounds good.
All right.
I'll talk to you then.
Bye.
- What's cookin'?
- Mrs. Potter.
She called all the way from stateside.
She had a premonition that something was happening to the colonel.
My mother gets those.
She had a premonition about the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
- She tell anybody?
- Nah.
She didn't get it till December 9th.
- And this, of course, is our mess tent.
-  Tell the general I'd offer him dinner, but it's not for me to endanger his health.
-  -   The general said that one day we should have a war in which only cooks fight one another.
- In that way, we could get rid of the common enemy.
-  - Tell him I agree.
-   Right this way, General.
I gotcha!
I got him!
Get the M.P.'s!
Jump that one!
They always work in pairs!
Frank!
Frank, get off.
Frank, get off!
- What are you doing?
I had him!
- That's General Park - of the Army of the Republic of South Korea.
-  - South Korea?
- I think his name translates as Ashley Wilkes.
Is that south enough for you?
-  - Uh, General, uh I'm, uh, sorry to have been so rough on you, sir, and  Very good.
Very good.
"Foot inspection feels like it goes on forever, Ma.
"That's 'cause there's about 200 people in this unit "and with each one having 10 toes, that's 20,000 toes to check.
-  - It's open!
- Good morning, Klinger.
- Hi!
How's this sound?
"Dear President Eisenhower - Sending away for seeds?
- "Congratulations not only on becoming president "but getting out of the army at the same time.
"If I thought it'd work for me, I'd run for the office in a second.
- Off with the shoes.
- "When you go through President Truman's mail "you will no doubt find some letters I wrote "describing the mental condition of my mind.
"I have deteriorated even more downhill since I sent him the picture of me dressed only in combat boots and a black garter belt".
- Right foot's fine.
- Check.
"As a former big-time officer, you will understand how undesirable it is to have a weirdo like me in the service".
Why is your little toenail missing?
I put my pinky in the pencil sharpener at the draft board.
- You did not!
- When he lowered my pants, there was a rose in my shorts.
"Return me to my loved ones, sir, and my uncle "who is very big in certain circles will rub out anyone you want at a discount".
Toes fine.
One nail missing and one screw loose.
Go!
Frank, when am I gonna inspect you?
- Just keep your nose out of my feet.
- Well put.
Hey, guys!
Chuck me one!
Toss it here!
Well, give me a little warning, will ya?
- I'm ready.
- Thank you, Father.
- You have a lovely touch.
- Never took a lesson.
I've often thought, with your gentleness, your compassion I believe you'd have made a good priest.
I'm too crazy about neckties.
How long have you had these feet, Father?
They were original equipment.
Make a note of that.
Feet have only had one owner.
They're holding up very well.
- Must be all the kneeling.
- No doubt.
- Where'd you get this scar, Father?
- My sister bit my toe.
- Your sister the nun?
- Now nun.
Then, angry child.
- She has quite an overbite.
- Don't spread this around.
The other children called her "Beaver".
- That's mean.
- We told her it was because she was such a good swimmer.
Well, no corns, no fungus, no bunions, just a nun bite.
- One nun bite.
- Father.
- Colonel Potter got a hundred percent.
- Wow!
"You'd like Captain Pierce, Ma.
Least I think you would.
"He's real smart, but kind of crazy.
"I've seen him amputate people's legs one minute "and then glue Major Burns's boots to two bedpans the next.
"Maybe things like that got something to do with each other, I don't know.
"To continue on further, Ma "I'm really happy about my pet, which I finally got one.
"I sent away to a mail order house for a guinea pig, and he's doin'terrific.
"I named him Dopey, after the Seven Dwarfs.
"Getting back to Colonel Potter "boy, talk about your premonitions.
"Remember how old Aunt Dorothy always knew something was gonna happen "whenever her truss got warm?
Well, Aunt Dorothy had nothin' on Mrs. Colonel Potter.
" -  - Halt!
Friend or foe?
Out of my way!
I'll run you down!
Pass, friend.
Klinger, on the double!
The colonel's been shot!
- Sir, what happened?
- A sniper got him on the road.
- Oh!
Please don't die, sir.
- Buffalo chips.
There's other men got hit worse that'll be in here soon.
- I just bought one in the old bucket.
- Let's get some help.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Major?
- Shouldn't be a minute, sir.
- You were very brave back there.
- Very level-headed.
- Thank you, sir.
Mrs. Potter has those qualities.
You couldn't ruffle her feathers if you hit her with a brick!
- What's all the hoo-ha?
- Colonel Potter caught some sniper fire.
- Colonel, are you all right?
- No, I am not all right.
This sauce I'm sitting in is my own blood, and I'm so full of lead you could use me for a doorstop!
- Much pain?
- My can's throbbin' two beats faster than my heart.
-  Here we go!
- I'll get things started.
- All right.
Good girl.
- In the clinches, which isn't a bad idea.
Colonel!
Colonel Potter, are you all right?
- I'm all right, Radar.
- Somebody said you were dead!
Well, it wasn't me.
All I got was a night deposit in my derriere.
- Oh!
- We'll have you under in a minute, Colonel.
Pig feathers!
You don't have to knock me out.
Just shoot a local in there.
I want to watch you characters work.
We'll give you a rearview mirror.
- A little higher, Radar.
Yeah, that's fine.
- Yes, sir.
- Swab that, please.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Stuff's in pretty deep.
It's gonna take awhile.
- I got no place to go.
What a unique device, the human tush.
An architectural marvel.
One of a kind.
Actually, two of a kind.
Designed to support our weight for a lifetime of sitting it also has the subtlety to do the samba.
And when attached to certain members of the female species at a time when light summer dresses are worn, can cause some of us to drive our cars - straight up a lamppost.
- Stop dawdling.
Dawdling?
I wax poetic, sir.
You're in luck.
There's a man from Hallmark in the first row.
- Colonel!
I just heard.
- I'm all right, Father.
-  - He got shot in the "derriere-y".
- A little to the right there, Hunnicutt.
- I got it, Colonel.
Colonel.
!
It's your missus.
!
She's on the phone.
!
Oh, yeah.
She called before, sir.
She had a feeling something happened to you.
She's always having premonitions.
She listens to that crazy gypsy who runs the fruit stand.
- What should I tell her?
That you've been shot?
- Don't say that!
The woman's got enough trouble.
Having root canal no vertical hold on the TV, and the scales fell off her guppy.
- What shall I tell her?
- If you're up to it, we could string a line in here.
- The phone won't be sterile.
- Klinger, boil that phone.
- I like mine four and a half minutes.
- Let's go.
It'll bejust a minute, ma'am.
Oh, yeah, he's, um He's over at the Officer's Club, and someone's using the line.
Right.
Oh, no, no.
He's okay, honest.
Um, I was sorry to hear about your guppy.
Right.
We had a parakeet that ran away from home.
I don't know why.
Just took some seed and his best bell and we never saw him again.
Oh, boy Okay.
Hold on for Colonel Potter, ma'am.
I'm perfectly fine, Mother.
Yes, just as Radar said, I'm at the Officer's Club.
I'll have another beer.
- May I have the next tango?
- Take it easy.
The woman's not a nitwit!
What's that, Mother?
Oh, I do respect your premonitions.
Yes, it was you who said my sister'd go bald.
Happily, you're wrong this time, is all.
-  - That?
That was an olive pit.
- Yes, dear.
-  My goodness.
More wounded!
I'll finish up here.
You take care of the new people.
- Right.
Right.
Klinger!
- Let's get Frank.
- Sir.
!
Yes, sir.
- Get Major Burns.
Now look, sugar, we're gonna have to get off the phone in case the war gets going again.
Take some aspirin, get your vertical hold fixed and buy yourself a new fish.
- I want to see the X rays.
- Right away, Doctor.
- Where's my gas passer?
- I'll get him.
Affirmative, sweetheart.
Yes, I love you too.
Good-bye, Mother.
Not a bad performance, if I do say.
- Especially when the star has a slug in his butt.
-  Well, well, well.
Sergeant Callan.
Small war, isn't it?
- They got me again, Doc.
- Uh-huh.
- No sweat.
- Can't get 'em to stop shootin' at me.
- How's the wife?
- Oh, she's gonna have her operation next week.
- Thanks to you.
- You're getting one right now, thanks to me.
- Hawk?
My watch salesman's back.
- Uh-huh.
Am I really gonna be all right, Doc?
- I'll have you running as well as that watch in no time.
-   Pass me the rusty saw, please.
One rusty saw, coming up.
"They were only kiddin: Ma.
Our doctors are really teriff.
"Except for Major Burns, of course.
Speaking of which, Captain Pierce finally got to finish his foot inspection last night.
"   -  Are you people crazy?
- Foot inspection, Frank.
- This is it!
- Hold still.
- Unclench your foot, Frank.
- Touch my toes and I'll have you killed, then court-martialed.
Nail polish?
- Frank!
- Isn't that Major Houlihan's color?
It was all in fun.
We were, uh discussing trench foot, a-a-and then we got a little silly.
You're not gonna put this on my report, are you, Pierce?
I think you'll find I'm pretty much all business, Frank.
"Burns, Frank, Major.
"Strange coloration of all toenails possibly due to combat action with a hostile manicurist".
"Well, Ma, I guess it's about time to sign off now.
"I better mail this letter before Dopey eats it.
"If they gave me a penny every time I thought about you "I guess I'd be makin' about 100 bucks a week.
"Don't worry if the war news is bad.
I'm okay.
Love, Walter".
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Oh  No, no, operator.
Listen to me closely, please.
Well, I told you three times.
Will you get it straight?
Not the Hairywood Hotel.
The Hollywood Hotel in Tokyo.
On Showadori Street.
Showa - Well, however you say it.
-  Oh!
Moron.
Major Margaret Houlihan.
I'll wait.
Margaret, it's me, Frank.
Well, I can't talk louder.
I'm in Radar's office and he's sleeping just a few feet from me.
God knows what filth he's dreaming.
Margaret, puss, I've been trying to get you for five hours.
- Are you all right?
Where have you been?
- Oh, well the nurses' seminar lasted forever.
Captain Parish gave a talk on earwax problems in the artillery.
Dr. Nyler gave a talk on peristaltic rhythm.
Last year he nearly won the Nobel Prize for dysentery.
And then he also gave a talk on suppositories"The Bullet of Health".
- It's three in the morning.
I was getting worried.
- Were you, Frank?
Oh, I called and called.
I thought maybe you'd been in a rickshaw wreck.
You know, those drivers get running in the rain and their glasses steam up.
The glass.
Wash the glass.
Well, after the seminar, some of the girls, the nurses, and Fred - Fred?
- Went out for a bite on the Ginza.
Margaret, who's Fred?
I thought it was a nurses' seminar.
He's a physical therapist.
Nice, but dumb.
He hasn't got a brain in his whole "bod-y".
Margaret, why do you say "bod-y" like that?
What do you know about his "bod-y"?
- "Bod-y".
- He's just a big, strong kid.
He crushed a beer can with two fingers.
Show-off!
Once I killed a gopher with a stick.
What'd you do?
Where'd you go?
- We all went to a bathhouse.
- And where was Fred?
Well, we didn't see much of him.
He likes to stay underwater.
Margaret, l What?
All right, operator.
Right away.
They're going to cut us off, punkin.
Our time's up.
Oh, I miss you so much.
Hurry back.
I got a new Andre Kostelanetz record.
It's called Two Alone.
We'll put it on in your tent and I'll crush a beer can with my knees.
Margaret, l Margaret?
Margaret.
Oh, Margaret.
Oh, shut up.
Attention, all personnel.
Ralph Kiner has just hit his 47th home run of the season.
And Corporal Murphy has just struck out in the laundry room.
- Gimme a lap sponge here.
Colonel Potter?
-  Captain Pierce.
I think it's only fair to tell you that this is my last patient.
- For today?
- For forever.
- So, you're leaving.
- All I need is a doggy bag filled with our cook's famous unborn hash and a jeep with a full tank.
I'll drive north up through Mongolia, take a right at Siberia.
I may have a little trouble crossing the Bering Strait.
But after that - it's downhill all the way.
- Especially if you have the lights.
- Right.
- We'll set it up after lunch.
- Can we have some quiet in here?
- Don't bleed so loud.
It's like operating with a broken record going around and around.
And "around and around".
- Colonel!
- Major I do wish you'd exercise your command.
I only exercise it once a month.
I don't want to get muscle-bound.
- Thanks a heap!
-  - Oh, terrific, Kelly.
- Sorry, Doctor.
- You think I dropped it, don't you?
- I didn't say that, sir.
It's obvious you thought so the moment I dropped it!
Come on in here.
We can talk better.
- Radar, no calls.
-  Yes, sir.
- Me too.
- Gentlemen, I need your help.
- Command me, sire.
- If it's shorts you want, you can have my other pair.
- They need a little work.
- No horsin' around now.
I'm serious.
So am I. Take my shorts and let the chips fall where they may.
Frank Burns is driving everybody nuts.
Ever since Major Houlihan went to Tokyo.
He even made Klinger cry.
- The cad.
- Told him his platform shoes made him look like a tramp.
You've seen him in O.R. All thumbs.
- And two of'em up his nose.
- Colonel, you've only been around him for a few months.
- He's been a boil on my butt for a hundred years.
- Then let's lance that boil.
- The man feels totally friendless.
- He is.
As a favor to me and for the good of the unit, be nice to him.
Buddy up to him.
Treat him like a pal.
You must have something in common.
- True.
We hate each other.
- Hawkeye, B. J I'm begging ya.
Who could resist those big Colonel eyes?
- Your bet, Father.
-  No help from the pit boss in the sky.
- I call your two and raise five dollars.
- Hmm.
Bye-bye.
- Five bucks?
- Too rich for my blood.
Ah, come to Papa.
- Where'd you learn to play poker, Father?
- Eddie Bertolucci.
Knew him well.
First man to ride a caraway seed down the alimentary canal.
Actually, he was a mailman.
When he passed the civil service, I blessed his feet.
- Half-a-buck ante.
Straight draw.
- There's mine.
- Who said you could play poker in here?
- I did, Burns.
- Enjoy your game, sir.
-  - Keep your enlisted giggles to yourself.
- Yes, sir.
- Pot's light.
- I'm in.
- I'm in.
-  - Oh.
Oh, yeah, it's me.
I was watching Major Burns untie his boots.
And he does it without a safety net.
Dizzy simp.
- Oh, come on - Go on.
- Frank?
- I don't have to take that!
Why don't you get in the game with us?
Oh, thanks a lot.
I know when I'm not wanted.
- No, come on.
We really want you.
- Me?
- Yeah, come on, Frank.
- We don't mind.
- Get Frank a drink, B. J. - Yes, sir.
Park it right here.
I don't know much about poker.
Louise and I mostly played whist at the Moose Hall.
I read that in Cholly Knickerbocker.
Go easy on that rotgut.
It'll pickle your giblets.
Uh-huh.
- Half-a-buck ante, Frank.
- Mm.
-  A snapper purse?
- Oh, it says "no" to pickpockets with a capital "N".
Get Mr. Ravenal a refill.
Anybody else for pickled giblets?
Oh, no, thank you.
That's all right.
- Straight draw, Frank.
- Well, I don't know much about the game.
You get five cards.
Keep your best.
You know, pair, three of a kind, et cetera.
Then you draw, discard your garbage and keep your best five.
Any dumb Dora knows that.
It's nice and lemony.
- You had lemons in there?
- We threw in a couple of cough drops.
- Is this jacks or better?
- Si, senor.
- I can't open.
- Nope.
-  Father?
- I open for a dollar.
- Bye-bye.
- I'm in.
- Frank?
- Well, what do I say if I want to say I think I can win?
- How about "So long"?
- Just say call.
- Then I say call.
- Me too.
How many cards you want, Radar?
Two.
Three.
Uh, four.
Brilliant devil.
He's obviously got one of a kind.
-  Klinger?
- Two beauties, please.
Can I have another lemon squash?
- Comin' up, Tex.
- Best keep your wits about you, Major.
Oh, don't worry about me, sir.
I got a hollow head.
- Father?
- I'll take two, please.
One off the top, if you don't mind.
- Frank?
- Don't bother me now.
I'm busy.
- How many cards do you want?
- These will suit me just fine.
- Watch him.
- Uh-oh.
- He's bluffing.
- Dealer takes three.
Father, you opened.
I'll bet a dollar.
And up a half.
- Frank?
- Fifty dollars!
- Fifty dollars?
- Five-dollar limit, poker face.
- Well, five dollars then.
- Okay, I'm in.
Gee, I was gonna buy a war bond.
What's more important?
The card game or the war?
-  You can play war anytime.
- Okay, I'll stay.
- I'll stay.
- Oh, dear.
That's 5.50 to me.
I'll call, and may the Lord have mercy on my cards.
Same deal for me, Lord.
What do I do now?
Can I bet again?
-  No!
- No, you can't.
Always wants to bet.
No, we called your hand, Frank.
Let's see your cards.
Ah.
- Ay.
- A heart flush.
- Do I win?
- It's all yours, Frank.
- You sure you've never been on this boat before?
-  - Ten high straight, Frank.
-  -  Jacks full of deuces.
-  Holy!
Me again?
Father, would you pull your collar over your ears?
I have a few filthy words to say.
- I'm broke.
- There goes the zircon for my belly button.
- Peg will kill me.
- Gee, I must've won about two hundred dollars.
I'd like to join in more fun things with you guys.
Okay.
You're invited to our sack race in the minefield.
##  - You're dancing better.
- I'm learning by mail.
- You wanna dip?
- You might hurt yourself.
I can jump out of the way.
So this is customary, huh?
Oh, yeah.
The winner always buys the booze.
- Can I make a personal remark?
- Is it about your breath?
Up till tonight, I always thought you were low, filthy scum.
And we always thought you were a rotten fink, until tonight.
- And perhaps tomorrow.
Maybe forever.
-  What a nice thought.
Oh, doughboys one and all.
Buddies at the front.
## I had my eye on that for a long time.
- Radar?
- Nurse Kelly.
- Nurse Kelly?
- Yeah!
The curve of her gluteus maximus.
The red fullness of her lips.
You're drooling, Frank.
Would you like a lobster bib?
Well, here goes nothin'.
Can a fella cut in?
- Who?
- Me.
Oh, uh, yes, sir.
Nurse Kelly!
I think it's fair to tell you that I've admired you for some time now and in more than a professional manner.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
-  You're really a hotsie-totsie.
## Come on.
Pep it up, Father.
Let's liven up the party, huh?
## ## -  -  He's okay.
He's just rusty at having fun.
Careful.
Yeah.
I'd never forgive myself if I dropped him.
- What's goin' on?
- Helping an old lady across the street.
- He O.D.'d on bourbon and Kelly.
- I appreciate what you boys are doing.
- Things are going to be much better around here.
- Only if we bury him.
I'd buy that.
Here we go.
- Wait.
Wait.
Not on me!
Not on me!
-  Gangway!
-  - Easy!
Now, don't wake him up.
Don't wake him up.
- Don't you feel like a hypocrite?
- Like kissing Hitler on the mouth.
I'm tired of being nice to this khaki specimen.
- Let's close the case.
-  You got a toe tag?
Wha What are you writing?
- "Emotionally exhausted".
- "And morally bankrupt".
Not too tight.
We don't want to cut off his ice water.
I don't know whether to sleep in my filthy clothes or put on my filthy jammies.
I don't know whether I don't care or I don't care.
Heart flush.
Doesn't know which end is up and he gets a heart flush.
- I'd like to give his heart a flush.
-  - Halt!
Who goes there?
-  I gotta go to the john!
You gotta give me the password, heart flush.
Bursting bladder!
Close enough for jazz.
- Be nice to the rats.
It's their mating season.
-  # Swanee, how I love ya how I love ya # - # My dear ol' # -   What have we got?
Wounded?
Come on.
Let's get 'em in.
Okay.
You got it.
In here.
- What's your hurry?
- We gotta get back to the front.
Major?
Holy moley!
Out, Radar, or I'll turn you into a lamp base.
Major Burns has got the duty and I can't find him anywhere.
- Try the latrine.
- I did.
He hasn't even taken the wrapper off his new National Geographic.
He's not in camp.
Gee, maybe he's been captured.
Let's find that enemy soldier and give him a nice tip.
What's ten percent of Frank Burns?
- You try Major Houlihan's tent?
- Yeah, it's got a big padlock on the door.
Well, does it look like it's been cried on?
I remember you guys carried him back in here.
- We dumped him on his bed.
- He was sound asleep.
Oh, I better report to Colonel Potter.
Or you could report to Colonel Potter.
How do you figure?
We carried him in here, laid him out.
Didn't we take his boots off?
We must've.
My eyes are still burning.
Oh, come on, guys.
No horsin' around now.
What've you done with Burns?
- We did what you said.
- We showed him a good time, right?
- Right.
- He's disappeared!
It's his way of saying "thank you".
- Radar, you say Klinger saw him go to the latrine?
- Yes, sir.
Did he hear a splash or anything?
Uh, sir, it's Captain Saunders, Battalion Aid Station.
- Nick, how you doing?
- Not bad, Colonel.
Listen, I think I have one of your officers up here.
He's out cold, but his dog tags read, uh, "Frank Burns".
- What?
- Skinny guy uh, no chin, big pores?
- Is he wounded?
- No wounds.
Uh, but his toe tag reads, uh, "Emotionally exhausted and morally bankrupt".
Whatever the hell that means.
"Emotionally exhausted"?
And morally bankrupt.
You guys pull a fast one, put a toe tag on Burns last night?
We addressed him, but we didn't mail him.
I'd appreciate it mightily, Nick, if you'd ship him back down here to us.
I'd like to help you, but we're short on wheels here.
We only have room for the wounded.
If you want him, you're gonna have to get him.
Okay, Nick, I understand.
So long.
- They do not deliver.
- Can they hold him on layaway?
They've got their hands full.
Somebody's got to go get him.
I need two volunteers Pierce and Hunnicutt.
Why don't we go tell them?
Practical jokes.
I'm glad I'm not one.
Hey, come on!
Why do you always keep me waiting?
You know I hate to be late.
- Sorry.
- And that's what you're wearing?
That looks terrible.
You wore that the last time we went to the front.
I thought we might need some Fig Newtons.
Oh, good idea.
We can spit seeds at the enemy.
Let's move, Kato.
-  Ready?
- Ready, sir.
To Lieutenant General Harrison Hardcastle Letterman General Hospital, San Francisco, California.
Dear General, I was not aware that your daughter, Amanda was selling subscriptions to McCall's Magazine.
Please put me down for two years.
Militarily yours, Colonel Sherman Potter, et cetera, et cetera.
This general helps his daughter sell magazines, sir?
It's the old army game.
At Fort Leavenworth I had a four-year subscription to his wife's cupcakes.
-  - I got it.
Colonel Potter here, MASH 4077.
Nick Saunders, Colonel.
We've got a pretty big party up here.
- Lots of heavy stuff.
-   Yeah, Colonel?
I wish you could help me too.
No, listen, we might be overrun so you better keep your people away.
Right, Nick.
Thanks.
Good luck, guy.
They're under attack.
Pierce and Hunnicutt are walking into a holocaust.
- Oh, golly.
- You said it, brother.
This kid doesn't need a doctor.
He needs a farmer.
-  We'll have to clean him up.
-  I'll do it.
Nice location you got here, Captain Saunders.
- Hmm, you think so?
- Any closer, you could be in a Chinese draft board.
- Am I gonna be all right, Doc?
- Nobody gets out of paying his bill with me.
Better start getting some plasma right now.
Medic!
- We're all out of strawberry.
You'll have to take vanilla.
-  - Set that up right away.
- Okay, Doc.
- What do ya got?
- Took one in the stomach.
- Oh, boy.
- Pressure bandage!
That guy can sleep through anything.
Yeah, he's embalmed in bourbon.
- Cover the wounded!
- Ah!
- Medic!
Get me a suture setup!
- No, no, no, Captain, this isn't a MASH.
- You get him stable if you can, then just put him on a chopper.
- Right.
- Why don't we wake up Frank?
He'd be some help.
- Oh, leave him alone.
As a doctor, he's hitting his peak right now.
- Come on, Frank.
- Up!
-  - Come on.
- Oh!
Whoa.
-  - He's heavier.
- It's all our money.
- We're always carrying this guy.
- I've been carrying him for years.
- Lay him down gently.
- Why?
It's a good thing you don't come C.O.D.   Well, now you've seen an aid station.
What do you think?
Beats hell out of Bermuda off-season.
Say good night, Gracie.
Good night, Gracie.
Captain Hunnicutt, Colonel P C - Oh, Major Burns, sir, you've got the duty.
- Huh?
Oh, right.
Well, another day, another dollar.
- Hawkeye?
- Huh?
Uh, Colonel Potter wants to see you right away.
There's nothing like a 15-second nap.
- B. J., Colonel Potter.
- Naturally.
Ah, come on, you sleepyheads!
Up and at 'em.
- Oh, buzz off, Frank.
- Get lost.
- I don't understand.
You hate me again.
- What's not to hate?
We were such pals last night.
- It was a dream, Frank.
- All a dream.
No, it wasn't!
I was popular and don't you deny it!
-  Major Houlihan!
- Major Burns.
What a lovely surprise.
Here, let me help you with your bag.
I could bite your clusters off.
How was your, uh, seminar in Tokyo?
- Worthwhile?
- Very informative, yes.
You'd be amazed at the things they're doing with suppositories these days.
- Oh, how was the weather?
- Lovely.
- Oh, Margaret, Margaret, Margaret!
- Frank, Frank, Frank!
Oh, it's heaven to see you.
Oh, you taste so good.
Well, I had a sardine sandwich on the plane.
Tell me everything.
Tell me everything!
Everything?
Oh, it's been "el boro".
I trimmed the hair in my ears one night.
That's the only time I stopped thinking about you.
And they showed that Sonja Henie hygiene film - Of Ice and Lice.
- My poor baby.
The marines stole The Jolson Story and they won't give it back.
- Well, now that I'm here, we'll make our own fun.
-  Did you bring me a present, hmm?
You silly billy.
Close your eyes.
Oh, Margaret!
Glazed plums!
I saw them in a window.
I said, "That's Frank".
You're mad.
- Margaret, I'm on fire.
- What can I do to put you out?
I gotta go on hospital duty.
Oh, well, there's always later.
I hear the peace talks are going badly.
We can only hope.
And then we went to see a play at the Kabuki.
I can't pronounce it in Japanese, but it means "Geisha girl, the samurai have arrived to take you to the dance".
- We?
You mean you and the girls?
- And Fred.
Fred.
- Fred Fred?
- Fred, Frank.
Anyway, he understands Japanese and has the most beautiful samurai sword.
Samurai sword?
Well, where'd you see it?
Does he wear it around or what?
He has a picture of it in his wallet.
- Trouble in paradise?
- One can only hope.
- Suppose a rabbit died?
- Looks to me like she's having lunch with him.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
-  -    Easy.
Are you all right?
I didn't see you till the last second.
You shouldn't play in the road like that.
Wait a minute.
I want my bag.
Here.
Hold it.
You wanna take that.
I was on my way back to camp, you know, from an aid station.
Not so fast, kids.
Easy.
Please don't fight.
Okay.
Don't fight.
- Please, I hate coming home to a fight.
-  I don't suppose anybody speaks English here, huh?
English?
You speak English?
You speak English?
I speak a little Korean but just enough to get my face slapped.
Can I have that bag, please?
The bag.
Yeah.
That's it.
That's the one.
On the floor.
Right.
With the red cross.
Thank you.
I'm a doctor.
You know?
Doctor?
How can I make you understand "doctor"?
Maybe if I sent you a bill or an old magazine.
Here.
Look.
See?
I'm with the 4077 th.
American army hospital.
G.I. Joe.
You know?
The good guys.
Doris Day.
#You smile, a song begins You speak, and I hear violins # # It's magic ## Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
No offense, ma'am, but the water here has enough germs in it you could sell it by the slice.
Please don't holler.
I have an enormous pain in my head.
It's really enormous.
You could sell advertising space on it.
You know?
Advertising?
#Halo, everybody, Halo ## The 4077.
It's about 20 miles south of here in Oijongbu.
Oh.
Oijongbu.
Oh.
Oijongbu.
- Oijongbu.
- Oijongbu.
Oijongbu.
You know?
Oijongbu, Korea.
Right?
All right.
I'm writing to them.
I'm telling them to come and get me because I'm hurt.
I must be, because I'm a doctor, and it says right here I'm hurt.
I want somebody to take this note to the 4077 th in Oijongbu.
- Oijongbu.
- Oijongbu.
Fast.
As fast as you can go.
Please.
Go fast.
Go as fast as you can.
Please.
Go fast.
Go as fast as you can.
- Does she know where Oijongbu is?
- Oijongbu?
Oh, great.
Uh-oh.
Uh, we may have a little problem here, folks.
My head is bleeding.
I'm sweating.
My pulse feels like it's playing "The Minute Waltz".
Oh.
Look at him.
And I thought I was in trouble.
What you may have here is you may have a seat at a public concussion.
I gotta hold on.
I don't want to lose consciousness.
I have a feeling if I go to sleep here, I'm gonna wake up at the family plot in Maine.
People come from all over the state to look at our tombstones.
The Pierces have been in Maine since 1680.
Some of them are dead now.
We came over early.
Alexander Pierce played piano in the cocktail lounge on the Mayflower.
But getting back to me, concussion-wise just talking off the top of my possibly late, great skull Oh, thanks.
I have eight bones in my head.
You do too.
It's notjust because I make $400 a month.
But what my problem is now, mainly, is that one of my bones may have split two for one.
You'd be getting a check soon if you had stock in my head.
Believe me, this hurts me a lot more than it hurts me.
But enough of this technical talk.
Putting it simply, what has happened is I have suffered a blow to my occipital bone right where it articulates with the parietal.
What that's called is that's called a contrecoup.
See, what's happened here is that my brain has sloshed over to the other side of my skull and is right now, even while I'm talking to you, turning purple.
You may have noticed certain purple patches of literary excess in my spoken word.
But don't worry.
I'll keep it clean in front of the children.
Actually, class it is a medical fact that there is no danger of dying if you fall asleep while you have a concussion.
On the other hand, I have a reason for staying awake which is that I'm afraid I'll die if I fall asleep while I have a concussion.
I'm just gonna keep talking, all right?
I remember at a party once in college I got sick on beer.
So, what happened was this football player this big football player came over to me this guy named, uh, Tank O'Melinski Big guy.
You may remember him.
He was almost made all-American.
Yeah.
That's the one.
So, anyway, uh Tank came over and he said, "Hold onto yourself".
He said, "Hang on to reality.
Don't get sick.
If you let yourself go, you're finished.
Just hold on".
I threw up all over his shoes.
Nice guy.
Beat the hell out of me.
Did I tell you that th-th-the skull has eight bones?
It does, you know.
Have I ever lied to you?
The occipital, the temporal uh, the frontal, two temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, two parietal.
Why do I have the feeling I'm losing you?
Look, forget about my skull.
Forget about my concussion.
A person needs a concussion like he needs a hole in the head.
Let's keep it light.
# I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy # # Yankee Doodle do or die # I can't dance.
My head hurts.
# I can't dance My head hurts # # I can't dance My head hurts ## That smells terrific.
You'd laugh if I told you what I have a taste for right now.
You ready?
A small piece of whitefish or some herring in sour cream with onions.
Marinated herring.
Mmm.
When I was in medical school trying to remember how many bones I have in my head I spent an untold number of hours at the fabulous Sol and Sol's Delicatessen.
Not the Sol and Sol's on Third Avenue.
The original Sol and Sol's.
They were brothers.
Sol and Sol.
Nobody could ever figure out why their parents gave them both the same name.
Anyway, after a day of cutting up the odd cadaver and while the parts and organs of the body were rattling around in my head I would dissect a whitefish.
You may have your moments that you hold dear my good sir, madam, ma'am, children, fellow chickens.
Your hearts may flutter as your flag unfurls.
Your breaths may quicken to your national anthem but for myself, I shall never forget the ease, the grace, the earnestness with which that whitefish gave itself up to me.
One eye turned chastely toward its plate.
The other staring unconcerned at its consumer: Me, Benjamin Franklin Pierce, M.D. "Mental Deficient".
As casually almost thoughtlessly Yes,  Even wantonly I devoured it.
And without a murmur of dissent without so much as a whitefish whimper it gave itself up to me.
Its very molecules of protein melding with my own until today.
That whitefish sings to you.
# I'm a Yankee Doodle Herring # #Yankee Doodle, do or die # Not bad, huh?
You thought I was gonna be lousy.
#Yankee Doodle went to London riding on a pony # # I am that Yankee Doodle boy-y-y-y-y ## I always had certain problems with pitch.
Though it's very hard when I'm half dead like this.
I'll be much better later when I'm immortal.
Well, enough about me.
Let's talk about you.
How do you like me so far?
- I wanted to say something.
What was it?
-   No, I'll think of it.
Don't help me.
Uh, Yankee Doodle, occipital, whitefish Oh.
Oh, yeah.
I remember.
Sol and Sol's.
Yeah.
They had the most fantastic waitress in there.
I mean fantastic.
Her name was Lefty.
I think she was, uh, Sol's daughter.
Sol's.
Not Sol's.
I went with her my last year at medical school.
After she finished work, I'd sneak her into the dorm.
What a terrific kid.
And talk about your parts of the body.
This girl was built like a brick autopsy.
I'm making you crazy, right?
I'll tell you later.
Here comes the wife.
For me?
Oh.
It's some moonshine.
Thank you.
That's very generous of you.
I really shouldn't drink it though.
Maybe just a little.
-  -   That's, uh, terrific.
Battery acid, right?
-  -  Beautiful kids.
I wish I had something for you.
Some "presento" or something.
I don't have a present.
Oh, wait.
Maybe I do.
Wait a minute.
In my bag.
You're, uh, brother and sister, right?
I'm an only child.
No siblings.
I guess after they had me my parents decided not to "sibble" anymore.
Here we go.
It's not much, but it's really nothing.
We fool around at the hospital with these a lot.
Uh-huh.
I think you better blow this up.
I'm not a big fan of fainting.
Just think of it as a balloon with fingers.
Or an udder in search of a cow.
That's "udderly" ridiculous.
If they don't come soon and put a Band-Aid on my memory it's gonna all come spilling out.
Good.
That's enough.
Let me have it.
Why do I have the feeling that my entire life is knocking on my tongue trying to come out between my teeth?
There we go.
There.
Eh?
Oh, yeah.
Good.
Okay.
Go outside and play where there's plenty of fresh air and land mines.
We're not taking those land mines with us when we go, you know.
They're yours.
Kids.
Nice.
I had a nice "kidhood".
You knew where you stood in those days.
Franklin Roosevelt was always the president.
Joe Louis was always the champ.
And Paul Muni played everybody.
Eloise McKay.
Eighth grade.
You have to understand.
Those were the old days.
We were brought up to think that girls were different, and I was young.
I mean, girls were martians.
Eloise McKay let me touch her slip.
She brought it to school in a box and I took it behind the science building and touched it.
That was it.
The whole transaction could have been conducted by mail.
I hope I haven't shocked anyone.
I mean, we're all adults here.
By the way, I'm a doctor, and I can tell you for certain that you're pregnant.
And we know what causes that nowadays too.
The smartest doctor I ever knew was Samuel Sacks, head of our medical school.
What a terrific guy.
I remember one day a student was talking to him, and he said "Doctor, what would you do if a patient died just as he was leaving your office"?
Without missing a beat, Sacks said, "I'd turn him around so it would look like he was coming in".
A lovely man.
Do you know who I hated?
Mrs. Tomassino, my geometry teacher.
She terrified me.
She stood over me in the front row with this big yardstick.
I used to look up into her nose.
She had three nostrils.
I guess she thought it was symmetrical or something.
But she was really nice if I got something wrong.
She was very helpful.
She'd look down at me and say -  "You got it wrong"!
-  -  "You got it wrong"!
-  - No, that's all right.
-  - That's okay.
She's not here now.
-  I really didn't need that yelling.
I wish I wasn't standing so close to me when I said that.
They really ought to be here by now.
Somebody from the camp.
I'm gonna go wait in the lobby.
Uh, just talk among yourselves, huh?
Maybe they're never coming.
Maybe this is it for me.
I'm Ronald Colman, and this is my Lost Horizon.
And you're Margo.
I guess you never saw that movie, eh?
You probably never see any.
You really ought to, you know.
There have been some great ox movies.
The Ox-Bow Incident A Yank at Oxford "The Wizard of Ox"?
"Cow Green was My Valley"?
No, that's cheap.
Come on, Radar.
Come on.
Somebody.
Anybody.
Nothing.
Nobody.
I can't understand it.
Sorry.
Here.
I don't wanna get any dirt on your wall-to-wall dirt.
There's a nice bit of chauvinism.
But I always say, there's no "vinism" like chauvinism.
# Like no "vinism" I know ## Merman.
Did I tell you I used to have a practice back in Boston?
Before I came over here to work for Harry Truman.
The doctor tell you to stay away from tobacco?
You know the great thing about Boston?
It's where all the musicals come to try out before they go on to Broadway.
-  - Yeah.
To fix the book.
Add a few songs.
Stuff like that.
I saw all the great ones there.
Oklahoma.
King and I. South Pacific.
# Some enchanted evening # #You may meet a stranger # You know what was great about that?
The way he did the ending.
# Once you have found her never let her go # # Once you have found her # # Never let her # - # Go # -  I think your dog is better.
I didn't just see hits there though, you know.
Before I left, I saw this real turkey.
A musical.
Up Your Love.
I remember the big song from that show a ballad.
#You're mine, I'm yours We're ours # #Who but you, who but me could be us better than we ## It was a real turkey.
Closed at intermission.
I love the theater, but I never come late.
That's why the doctor is a tramp.
And what's wrong with drama?
Watch this.
Watch this.
You're gonna love this one.
Watch this.
Laurence Olivier.
Richard III.
Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York.
Now that's really good.
Let's hear your dog do that.
Come on.
Bring him in.
Come on.
Huh?
What?
Forgive me.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know I was standing in the dining car.
Can I help you?
-  -  - What?
-  Oh.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
I don't know why nobody's here yet.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes the war hots up and the hospital gets very busy, you know.
Then at other times you could shoot off a cannon in there.
Of course, when they do that, then the war hots up all over again.
-  - I get the feeling I'm speaking in ever-diminishing circles until I disappear up my own mouth-hole.
-  - Thank you.
Oh, this is wonderful.
I'm glad I called ahead for a reservation.
-  -  Mmm.
Good.
- Aaah.
Hot.
Spicy.
-  Your baby's gonna need asbestos diapers.
Pretty soon, huh?
Don't you sometimes wonder about babies?
I mean, how do they know what to do in there?
They start out looking like little, hairless mice, and they wind up looking like us.
How's it all work?
I've I've held a beating heart in my hand.
I've poked into kidneys and crocheted them together again.
I've pushed air into collapsed lungs like beat-up old pump organs.
I've squeezed and probed and prodded my way through hundreds of miles of gut and goo and I don't know what makes us live.
I mean, what keeps us in motion?
What keeps the heart beating without anybody rewinding it?
Why do the cells reproduce and "re-re-reproduce" with such gay abandon?
What force brought us together in such fantastic complexity?
I've seen a lot of bodies and they never cease to amaze me.
Did you ever see Ann Corio or Margie Hart?
Strippers.
For a long time it was a toss-up whether I'd marry a stripper or a whitefish.
I remember Polly O'Day.
She worked with a parrot.
He didn't help her strip or anything.
While she got undressed, he stood on the side and talked dirty.
It was an exciting act.
What a body.
She was built great too.
Yeah.
But what I don't understand is how she got that way anymore than how we did.
Look at your hand.
It's one of the most incredible instruments in the universe.
Of all the bones in the body, one fourth are in the hand.
Forget the hand.
Look at your thumb that wondrous mechanism that separates us from the other animals.
The world-famous opposable thumb, that amazing device that has transported more students to college than the Boston post road.
Ideal for sucking, especially as a baby.
And lauded in song and story as the perfect instrument for pulling out a plum.
Or, in the case of the Caesars, for holding it down for the gladiator to die or holding it up, which means "See you later at the orgy".
My friends, for getting up and down the pike, in your pie, in your eye I give you the thumb.
Have you any idea, Farmer Brown, of the incredible complexity of this piece of human apparatus?
Of course not.
Never having spent any time at Sol and Sol's swilling borscht and jamming Latin into your brain while trying to imagine if Lefty the waitress is wearing a garter belt you have no idea of the balletic interplay of parts that make up the human thumb.
The flexor ossis metacarpi pollicis flexes the metacarpal bone.
That is, draws it inward over the palm thus producing the movement of opposition and the Boy Scout salute.
Because of this magical engineering, we could do this.
And this.
And this.
But our greatest triumph comes not from flexing the metacarpal bone and making a fist, which always seems to be thirsting to be clenched No, no, no, no, no.
Our greatest moment is when we open our hand cradling a glass of wine, cupping a loved one's chin.
And the best the most expert of all keeping all the objects of our life in the air at the same time.
My friends, for your amusement and bemusement, I give you the human person.
Thumb and fingers flexing madly, straining to keep aloft the leaden realities of life ignorance, death and madness.
Thus we create for ourselves the illusion that we have power that we are in control, that we are loved.
Thank you.
For my next trick, I will attempt to become stiff as a board.
I hate to eat and faint, but I don't know if I can even make it down to my knees.
That's him.
It's gotta be.
Radar!
-  - Lassie, it's Radar!
I'll be right there.
Wait a second.
Give me my stuff, will you?
Wait a minute.
Don't Wait a minute.
My shoes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The love I'll leave with you.
Take care.
Good-bye, Margo.
- Anybody home?
-  You get it?
"I have returned to Korea".
I brought you some "presentos".
For vegetables.
Very good.
-  - You're welcome.
Kids, some comics and some candy.
Not very good for you.
You better eat the comics and read the candy.
Sir, some tobacco.
I think you'll find it's a little better than the manure you've been smoking.
-  - Thank you.
Here's my name and my unit in Korean.
I want you to contact me when it's time for the baby, okay?
-  - Boy, that smells delicious.
What are you cooking?
What is that?
-  - Oh, thank you.
That smells so good.
Mmm.
Meat.
Where did you get meat?
Wait a minute.
Where's the dog?
-  - Oh, it's delicious.
What do you put in it?
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
- Wanna get that, please?
- Yes, Doctor.
- Almost finished.
- You do nice work.
That's why I get the big money.
You know, I figured it out.
All the work I've done divided by the time I've been in the army - comes to a nickel an operation.
- Lap sponge.
- How you doin', B. J.?
- Just about there.
It's a nasty head wound.
- Yeah, they're getting worse all the time.
- Well, that's war, jocko.
Gimme a hand here, will you, Father?
- Say the word.
- Go.
-  - Uh, give me a little Richardson.
No, the big one.
No, no, no.
T-The little one.
- Hold that door for us, will you, Klinger?
- Post-op's all jammed, sir.
- Let's put him against the wall, Father.
- We ain't got one free bed.
You'd think we were a motel.
Sorry, Father.
Well, I know all about motels, Corporal.
Each man prays in his own way.
- Get an I.V. Stand, Klinger.
- Right.
- Another boy from the 43rd.
- Colonel Coner's outfit.
He got hit in one of the Colonel's famous retrieval sweeps.
No more stands, Doc.
What now?
- Get a hammer.
Let's nail this to the wall.
- I wish I had your brains.
- I wish I had your beauty.
- There is that.
Our friend, Colonel Coner, specializes in trading warm bodies for cold.
He'd send a whole division behind enemy lines in order to pick up what used to be one human being.
- Hold this, will you, Father?
- Some awful funny people running this war.
Sometimes I'm sorry I bought tickets for it.
I'll see you in a bit.
Three-O silk on a Keith needle.
- Three-O silk.
-  - Oh - Need a hand, Frank?
- I don't need a hand from anyone.
- His own two lefts are enough.
- Mind if I watch?
- Makes me no never mind.
- Oh, Colonel Potter - Here.
There's something that's been bothering me for some time now, sir.
Very simple, Frank.
A mommy and a daddy love each other very much.
Now, the daddy has a seed - Put a bridle on it, Pierce.
What's on your mind, Burns?
- Trash.
Sir, I am keenly aware of the garbage in this camp.
There are tin cans, eggshells, pussy old bandages germy tongue depressors by the bushel.
It's dumped the regulation 25 yards from the camp and poses no threat to hygiene.
But we're wasting our waste, sir.
The locals are stealing it.
- They need it to survive.
- Well, they're not entitled to just walk off with it.
Frank's right.
You give these people a taste of our garbage, next they'll want New Jersey.
Now, what I'm suggesting is that we charge them for it.
Make 'em pay for every rind, every drop of swill.
- You wanna open some sort of bilious boutique, Frank?
- No, but I do have a plan.
This isn't what I'd call table talk, Doctors.
See me later, Burns.
- It'll be a pleasure, sir.
-  Maybe for you Finished.
Who'd have thought perfection could be so boring?
- Doctor?
- Hmm?
- What are you doing after?
- Please.
Put a note on the bulletin board like everyone else.
I'll give you a nickel.
Sold.
I'm so easy.
Captain Hunnicutt.
I was just walking by and I noticed this gizmo disconnected from the thingamabob and it wasn't dripping into the doohickey right.
You lost me with all the technical terms, but I get the picture.
- Is he gonna be all right, sir?
- He will now.
- Whew.
- Radar?
- Yes, sir?
- You may have just saved his life.
Really?
Gee, I didn't mean to.
Well, wh-who would've thought I could?
Gee.
- Come on.
Help me see if we can get him into post-op.
- Yes, sir.
Do you have a license to troll for surgeons?
Or is that roll with sturgeons?
- Right this way, my dear.
- You will be gentle.
The army's ruinin' my hands, you know.
- Mm-hmm.
- My hands are my best feature.
When I was born, my father took one look and said to my mother "Thanks a lot for the eight-pound baby nose".
And my mother said, "His hands, Amos.
Look at his hands.
He's a musician".
What do you think my old man did?
Went right out, stole a violin and stuck it in my crib.
I was one week old.
What did I know from violins?
- I started suckin' on the bridge.
-  - No kiddin'.
I'm not kiddin'.
- I believe you.
-  - What's wrong?
What's wrong, what's wrong?
You look happy, that's all.
I never see a happy face in the army outside the latrine.
Oh, l-I was helpin' Captain Hunnicutt before with a patient, you know?
- Yeah?
- And, uh, the guy's I.V. Bottle went all snafuy.
And so I, uh, fixed it up and Captain Hunnicutt says to me He says to me "Radar, you may have saved his life".
- You wanna save another life?
- Huh?
Don't eat that food.
- What's the matter with it?
- You ever pull kitchen duty?
- No, I've been lucky.
- Oh, it's beautiful.
You don't know the conditions.
They paint over the cockroaches.
If you ever saw what they put in the hash, you'd go screaming into the night.
And later you just might.
Oh, I don't care.
I saved a guy's life.
- Is he still in the army?
- Of course.
Some saving.
Our garbage is the mainstay of the local economy, sir.
I don't think you realize how much valuable material is being looted from our trash heaps.
I guess I just don't have your head for garbage, Burns.
The late Colonel Blake said I was the best rubbish officer we'd ever had.
The man knew talent when he saw it.
Smoke?
- Uh, would you like me to, sir?
- Never mind.
What do you think, sir?
Garbage-wise.
I'm not gonna make any decision until Radar gives me a breakdown of the situation.
Radar.
You got some poop on the garbage Sir, I've been going through the files.
I got the poop on our garbage.
- Shoot.
- "The typical sample of this hospital's waste products contains expended medical supplies, i.e., e.g., tongue depressors" They can take a few hundred of those and make a hooch.
I've heard a Korean landlord will kill for the chance to subdivide a packing crate.
"A few hundred yards of used and bloody surgical gauze" Oh, that can be washed out and used to make summer clothing.
- Go on.
- "Some stretched-out nurses' bras" - They can use those for hammocks, right?
-  - You shut up.
- Don't be abusive.
I'm sorry, Colonel.
It's just my nature.
Enlisted men have feelings, you know.
I keep forgetting that, sir.
- Continue, Colonel?
- No.
I have no interest in hearing a refuse recital.
Burns, what are you leading up to?
Sir, it's un-American to get nothing for nothing.
Now, I propose we auction our garbage off to local contractors.
- I'd let it go to the highest bidder.
- That's ridiculous.
As per Pentagon Directive, uh, N/R/358/9-A.
The Trashy Substances Act, sir.
Really?
Burns, some men are born to greatness others have garbage thrust upon them.
- You've got it.
- I won't let you down, sir.
There's no way you can.
Uh, congratulations, Major.
Hawkeye.
-  Hawkeye.
- What are you laughing?
- It's not funny.
- Don't worry about it.
I'm not worried.
- It can happen to anyone.
- So let it.
Let it happen to anyone.
Just don't let it happen to me.
Come on.
Sit back.
- Maybe a drink.
- Mm-mmm.
It's almost ready to be drunk.
I hear tomorrow's a very good year.
I don't think liquor's the answer.
You know, what just didn't happen here has never not ever happened before.
Well, maybe you just don't find me attractive.
Oh, that's true.
Except for your face, your mind and your body you're a complete dud.
- Come here.
- Careful.
I have to give them back after the war.
- Relax.
-  What I think's happened is the damned army started putting coffee in my saltpeter.
- It's thrown my whole system off.
- Mm.
Tell me about it.
- How 'bout an Oreo first?
-  - Shh!
My wife.
-  Hawk.
Hawk?
She always hawks like that.
Yes, dear?
- Captain B.J. Wants you in post-op.
- Radar, can't it wait?
What happened to your voice?
I got a new pair of shorts from home.
Sorry to leave you in mid-grope like this, but Hippocrates calls.
- When will you be back?
- Before you can whistle Carmen.
##  - I'm sorry to interrupt you.
- That's okay, Radar.
You saved me from contusions of the ego and compound embarrassment.
- How's your patient?
- He's really Radar's.
He alerted me to his condition.
I had a hamster used to get the same look in his eyes when he wasn't feeling good.
Let me see his chart.
You can go get some lettuce.
He's less responsive.
B.P.'s going up, pulse dropping signs of increased intracranial pressure.
- I'd stick close for a while.
- Right.
- Can I too?
Stick close?
- Of course.
And if you have to, I'd put in another burr hole.
Fair enough.
That sound right to you, Radar?
Huh?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Sounds pretty good to me.
What do you think?
Should we get a second corporal's opinion?
-  - Should we ask some people in - or should we just be boring on our own?
- Whatever.
- You're not drinking?
- I think I'll stop for a while.
- Mm.
- Getting nasty notes from my liver.
- I've never seen you wear those.
- Oh, I never do.
If you wear 'em, they get dirty.
If I keep washing 'em, they stay clean forever.
They're actually just to remind me of better times.
Argyle socks, angora sweaters, Woody Herman, fumbling in rumble seats.
- Rumbling in fumble seats.
- That too.
What do you think of Nurse Able?
If I wasn't married I'd start nibbling at Nurse Able's toes and stop when I got to her hairpins.
There is something there to arouse a male.
Unless he's been dead six months.
She was in here before um, with me, alone.
That's one of the worst kept secrets of the war.
She was in here before and, uh I, uh uh couldn't.
Couldn't what?
The big "couldn't".
Oh, that "couldn't".
Maybe I tried too hard.
Maybe I didn't try hard enough.
Maybe it was her perfume.
Maybe it was mine.
She looks a little like my mother.
Maybe Oedipus wrecked it for me.
It's perfectly understandable.
You've been going full tilt since you got here.
Your nerves are brittle enough to use for kindling.
- Tension.
- The war.
- Happens to everyone.
- Right.
- Ever happen to you?
- Never.
Fink.
- We got fresh wounded in pre-op, sirs.
- Right.
Thanks, Klinger.
Don't thank me.
Thank the Chinese.
- Hi, Frank.
- I'm doing the best I can.
- What have we got?
- Chest wounds here, leg wounds there.
I've seen worse.
- Only after you get through with them.
- Doctors.
-  - I want my boys to have the best.
- These guys from your unit?
- I'm Colonel Coner.
Oh, yeah.
The famous advance man from Forest Lawn.
Pay no attention, sir.
Their sense of patriotism is stunted.
Comes from smoking too many flags.
Let's get started on this guy.
Nothing personal, Colonel.
Just that we don't appreciate your making so many dead soldiers out of live soldiers by trying to retrieve so many dead soldiers.
Every one of our fallen boys deserves an American coffin.
- Prep him.
- Do me a favor, Colonel.
If you find out I've died, just let me lie there in the crabgrass.
- I don't wanna help you make the cover of Life.
- Or Death.
Whichever comes first.
Let's get an X ray on him, huh?
Well, shall we repair the effects of heroism?
After you, my dear Schweitzer.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm just going off.
- I'm just going on.
- You okay now?
- Yeah.
I was a little upset for a while, but it's passed.
For sure?
Well, at least my mouth is still working.
Okay, now we need a green piece for the sunglasses.
- Hm.
- Is this it?
No.
It looks sort of like, uh, Italy but with a low heel.
Where were you originally born?
I mean, as a child.
Chicken Falls, South Dakota.
Twenty miles from Mount Rushmore.
- Oh, hey, I was there.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Army was cleaning out Lincoln's nose.
- Oh, that's an earlobe.
- Oh.
- I can't wait to get back home.
- Yeah, me neither.
You know, once I called that number to get the time in Kansas City.
I listened for over an hour.
Really made me feel a lot better too.
What do you miss the most about back home?
- The most?
- Yeah.
One thing.
Oh.
Well, the grass, I guess.
Or the sky.
Everything.
Yeah.
- Radar.
- Oh, yes, sir?
- Where have you been hiding?
- I was just helping out with Private Phelan.
Did you order the new specimen bottles?
- Oh, yes, I did, sir.
- Let's watch this batch.
Don't let any damn fool try to play songs on 'em again.
- How 'bout the V.D. Films?
- Uh, I ordered two new ones, sir.
Uh, Clean as a Whistle and Buy You a Drink, Sailor?
- Fine.
What about those notes - Also, I typed those notes - I left on my desk to be typed?
- You left on your desk.
- My notes on equestrian etiquette?
- Yes, sir.
They're in your "in" basket underneath your toenail clippers.
- Hmm.
- Uh, sir?
Why do women ride sidesaddle?
Would you marry a woman that didn't?
- No, sir.
- How are you feeling, son?
- Okay, sir.
- He's gonna be just fine.
Thank you, Doctor O'Reilly.
That's an elbow.
Oh, yeah.
Hey.
Wow.
Look at that.
It's gonna be Jane Russell.
See?
Uh, can we do this later, Radar?
I'm gettin' kinda tired.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Oh, we couldn't have finished it anyway.
Major Houlihan confiscated all the best parts.
- Colonel Potter?
- Burns.
I just wanted you to know I'm about to hold my first garbage auction, sir.
Fine.
- Would you like to see it?
- No, thanks.
I'll wait till the movie comes out.
- The least you could do is wish me luck.
- Luck.
How do I look?
Almost lifelike.
All right, gentlemen, right this way.
Please take a seat.
Any seat.
Come on.
Mush.
Chop.
Chop.
Now, may I have your attention?
First, let me welcome each and every one of you wish you joy and, uh, chang-yo.
- "Chang-yo"?
- Yeah.
You wish each of us a prostitute?
I must have looked up the wrong word.
- We don't mind.
- Well, I mean "prosperity".
Worked out the same.
-  - All right, let's not get carried away, huh?
I guess people will always think it's funny when one of their betters makes a mistake.
Now, you've all had a tour of the camp garbage dump.
And you have seen for yourself that America throws away only the best.
Now, this waste will be auctioned off today and similar auctions will be held once a month twice a month when it gets warmer.
We're not too late for the big garbage sale?
- I wanna get something for my apartment.
- A Chippendale orange peel would be perfect for my breakfast nook.
All right.
Here we go.
Now, how much am I bid for lot number one U.S. Army grade-A garbage?
- Hmm?
- He could sell brass knuckles to Gandhi.
- Fifty.
Do I hear fifty dollars?
- One buck.
One buck.
Do I hear one and a half?
One and a half.
Very good.
One seventy-five, seventy-five, anyone?
Listen, Beej, whatever the highest bid is, bid five over it for me, okay?
You're gonna buy this garbage?
Really?
- Really.
- What are you going to use it for?
Well, if I tell you now, then you won't be surprised at Christmas.
Two seventy-five.
Three dollars.
Three dollars.
Do I hear fifty?
Right on time.
- Oh, thank you.
- You sure you don't mind being seen with me?
- Of course not.
- Some girls feel strange with married men.
Hi, kid.
I did everything I could, Radar.
How could he be alive like that one second and dead the next?
There's not much more than that in it.
It's not fair.
Fair's the last thing it is.
I mean, you operated on him twice.
The damage was just too extensive.
I could give you a lot of medical reasons, but understanding doesn't make it less painful.
Oh!
We got to be friends in just a few hours.
Friends don't need more.
Gee, I hope I don't cry.
It's no sin, Radar.
When was the last time you felt like crying, sir?
What time is it?
Very good, sir.
You hit the ground.
Oh, afternoon, Pierce.
Try your luck?
- I used to play as a youngster.
- Well, have a go.
Finally stopped when I realized my right arm had become three inches longer than my left.
Good try.
In '25, I made the semifinals at Fort Dix.
I aced out a 300-pound supply sergeant.
He blubbered like a baby.
Don't try so hard.
Let it go a little later.
- Good.
Bang on target.
- Thank you.
First time I scored in days.
- Been a rough one?
- Well, about normal.
We're tossing horseshoes, and four miles away they're tossing grenades.
- Uh-huh.
- Frank's selling prewar garbage at postwar prices to people who can't even afford the ground they're eating off.
- Uh-huh.
- And I'm impotent.
Uh-huh.
I think I see your problem.
Aim two feet beyond the stake.
You've gotta learn to unwind, son.
When's the last time you really let go of the reins?
The back of a fruit truck on a pile of rotting peaches.
I had a copy of Fanny Hill.
The truck went over a bump and I was in heaven.
You need a hobby.
I toss horseshoes.
The wife needlepoints migratory fowl.
Grandpa Roy whistles moose calls.
I knew a woman collected clippings of mine shaft accidents.
There you go.
If it's any comfort to you I had the same problem in World War I. - And you got over it?
- Mm-hmm.
But not until World War II.
- Ah.
-  Want some more coffee?
Uh, no, thank you.
Army coffee has made me a soprano.
- Colonel?
- Please.
Listen to this.
"The fastest amputation in medical history "was performed by Dr. R. Liston in 1801 without an anesthetic.
"It took 33 seconds and cost the assistant three fingers by his master's saw".
I like a heavy tipper.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Major Burns said I'm fit to leave.
Major Burns is an expert on fits.
I ordered your jeep, Colonel.
Be ready in a minute.
- Boy, I'm starved.
- Extracurricular carnage really builds up an appetite.
Private Phelan died last night, Colonel.
Who?
Phelan?
Gerald Phelan.
He was one of yours.
Wounded last time he went out looking for coffin refills.
I remember that mission.
We retrieved every Joe that bought it on Hill 911.
- And how many men did you lose?
- Our losses were insignificant.
- How many kids in an "insignificant"?
- Two.
Phelan makes three.
We knocked out That makes my kill ratio eight and a half to one.
Maybe nine and a half.
Do I hear ten?
Sold to the grim reaper in the third row.
Good morning, Colonel.
Colonel.
My, we have a lot of colonels here.
We're up to our brass in 'em.
I used to think you were clever till you bought all that garbage at the auction.
-  - You bought the garbage?
Well, you said get a hobby.
Captain Pierce, Colonel Coner's jeep's ready, sir.
Everything's ready, sir.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Well, have a nice trip, Colonel.
Yes.
Colonel.
Colonel.
Come on.
What's going on, Pierce?
I thought we'd give Colonel Coner an appropriate aloha.
Well, what are we lookin' at?
Beautiful!
Beautiful!
A Tintoretto in barf.
Mmm!
- I had dreams like this all through puberty.
-  I didn't see any of it, but I loved it.
- You're a pistol.
- That's my garbage.
- No, it's my garbage, Frank.
I got a receipt.
- Oh!
Hey, buy you a drink, sailor?
- Uh, not right now.
Thank you.
-  I got the time if you still got that nickel.
- All I've got's a quarter.
- No problem.
I think I can make change now.
-  - How'd your date go?
- I don't kiss and tell.
- Sorry.
It was terrific.
Now, look, sir.
We charge the men a dollar each for helicopter rides.
Add that to our garbage income and we'll be in the black inside a year.
This is a hospital, Burns.
I don't want us listed on the stock exchange.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
The contention is that the accused, with intent to usurp lawful military authority did, at the 4077 Mobile Army Surgical Hospital on or about October 11, 1952 willfully attack his commanding officer, Major Frank Burns and did illegally take command.
This preliminary hearing is to determine whether the facts in this case indicate that a court-martial should be conducted and whether the accused Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce, should stand trial under Article 94 on the charge of mutiny.
- Is that clear, Captain?
- Crystal, Colonel.
- Ali "Babber" to the end.
- How'd you like a grenade in your truss?
-  - Order.
As these charges have been brought by Major Burns the court requests that he open the proceedings by answering a few questions.
- Take the stand, Major.
- Yes, sir.
You swear that the evidence you give shall be the truth, the whole truth - and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
- "Absotively".
- A simple "I do" will be sufficient.
- I do, sir.
I'm certain you comprehend the seriousness of your charge, Major.
The penalty for mutiny, after all, is death or such other punishment as the court may direct.
I comprehend okay.
Death, or worse.
- Besides my life, Frank wants my virginity.
- We all do.
- If only I'd known.
-  Now, Major, you have served with the accused for some time.
All too long, Colonel.
Had he ever indicated to you that he might consider mutiny?
The man's a born troublemaker, sir.
He has no respect for his superiors and seems deliberately kind to those beneath him.
He's immoral, unmilitary and unpatriotic.
Under my framed picture of Senator McCarthy he wrote in big letters "Know Your Enema".
- Is that all?
- Well, isn't that enough?
I mean, are you finished?
Yes, except to say that people like Pierce are a menace to the American way of life as I see it.
Unless we each conform, unless we obey orders, unless we follow our leaders blindly there is no possible way we can remain free.
You may take your seat, Major.
Your fly is open.
Captain Pierce?
Do you swear the evidence you give shall be the truth, the whole truth - and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
- I do.
- You have any opening remarks?
- Yes.
Unaccustomed as I am to public lynching, let me say that even the army must have better things to do than listen to the ravings of a man with enough mold on his brain to produce a quart of penicillin.
Sticks and stones, Your Honor.
Major Burns has had it in for me since I suggested he created more widows and pallbearers than salmonella.
Would you say that your lack of respect for the major's medical skills might have been the cause for the alleged mutiny.
There was no mutiny.
It's his medical skills that are alleged.
I'd say that Major Burns snapped under the burden of command and that he never should have been put in the position of command.
And if the politicians of the world hadn't failed to keep the peace he'd be back in Indiana right now with his cozy little malpractice and meeting his receptionist two afternoons a week at the Golden Goose Motel.
- That's a lie!
- Don't leave your unopened mail around.
- That's hitting below the belt.
- Beats hanging.
-  - That'll do.
-  - That'll do.
Perhaps at this time we'd better hear from Colonel Sherman Potter.
Colonel Potter?
You swear the evidence you give shall be the truth, the whole truth - and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
- I do.
If you would start at the beginning, please, sir?
Very well.
On 5 October, I was preparing to depart for six days of R and R in Tokyo.
I can do all that for you, sir, after you've gone.
- It's no trouble.
- Don't you want to get started, before it gets dark?
- For Pete's sake, it's only 8:00 in the morning.
-  I forgot.
Major, I know you're not giggling 'cause you're wearing feathered underwear.
You just can't wait to park your can behind this desk.
I am second in command, sir.
Let's not do too much second-in-commanding while I'm gone, right?
- I prefer to lead by example, to command through respect.
- Mm-hmm.
But if all else fails, a leader can't hesitate to kick a few keisters.
- Oh?
- Ah, I think it was Napoleon who said "Without discipline, an army is no more than a bunch of guys wearing the same color clothes".
- Napoleon?
- Might've been Mussolini.
- Your jeep's ready, sir.
- Thank you, Radar.
- Take care of these papers.
- Yes.
- I told Tokyo you're on your way.
- Radio Tokyo I'm on my way.
- I'll look after Burns, don't worry.
- Look after Burns.
All I'm saying is don't go loco with the discipline.
I'll only be gone six days, so easy does it.
Of course, sir.
Have a nice time and, uh, don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I don't know that I'd wanna do anything you would do.
Only six days, Colonel?
God created the universe in six days.
Here's the morning mail, Major Pussycat.
Of course, God wasn't surrounded by a bunch of flakes.
Colonel Potter's chair wasn't even cold before Frank decided to re-create the 4077 in his own weird image.
I object to the word "weird".
How about warped?
Bizarre?
Balmy?
- Perverted?
Loony?
Loopy?
- Dippy.
- I'm gonna sue all of you.
- No doubt for definition of character.
Captain Pierce.
Please give the court some examples of the major's alleged peculiarities.
Well, on the very first day, Frank observed that the "M" in MASH stood for "mobile".
So he had us break down the entire unit and move it across the road.
- Frank has definitely flipped out.
- Flipped like a fox.
He's obviously picked up a couple hundred trusses cheap.
- Now he's creating a demand for them.
-  Come on!
Chop-chop!
Get the lead out.
This is a war, you know.
You see?
I told you it was a war.
But no, you keep saying we're both dreaming.
- How could we be in each other's dreams?
- How could I be in Korea?
More important, why is this chicken outfit crossing the road?
So we moved.
And then the next day we moved right back again.
- "M" stands for "mobile".
- Also for meshuga.
The major then insisted on cold showers, calisthenics parades, retreats and snap inspections.
Let's face it, Colonel.
All that discipline is a bit much to expect from dumb doctors.
True.
Worst of all, I guess, Major Burns ordered a ban on the camp's chief source of culture: Gambling.
But then, boys will be boys.
-  - What do you do, Radar?
- I'm thinking.
- Another first.
- Come on!
You giving this hand up for Lent?
- Give it a rest, Zale.
- He needs time.
- What do you care?
You're ahead 50 bucks.
The Lord moves in mysterious ways.
Okay, I'll see ya.
Read 'em and weep.
Three little ladies.
Is that all you got?
Three queens?
I got a straight.
How'd ya like to buy a half interest in a minefield?
Chickee!
Chickee!
- What's going on?
- Uh, spelling bee, Frank.
- Go ahead, B. J. "Cretin".
- Cretin.
C-R-E-T-l-N.
Cretin.
- What's a cretin?
- A moron.
A mental defective.
Let's hear it for the horse's mouth.
I want this kitchen to shine like my mother's.
You could've eaten off her floors.
- No plates, huh?
- Oh, can the sauce, Sergeant.
Field Marshal Rommel said, "You can judge an army by its kitchens".
Yeah?
In that case I guess your mother could've licked Germany single-handed.
Ah, droll.
Quel droll.
Now let's see if your freezer's equally amusing.
Shameful.
Now, for openers, I wanna see these carcasses lined up according to height.
I'm ashamed to wear the same uniform as these wienies.
- Where's the old Army pride, Zale?
- Beats the hell out of me, sir.
This is one sloppy inspection, Sergeant.
And you don't seem to give a solitary hoot.
Well, how would you feel if you lost 300 bucks?
- How?
Where?
- Well, uh, ou-out there.
Somewhere.
In the camp.
Lost.
I mean, one minute it was in my wallet and then the next minute, poof!
- Poof?
- Poof.
Three hundred dollars just don't go "poof" while I'm in command, Sergeant.
- You were robbed.
No question.
- You're right, sir.
I must've been robbed.
Who were you with just before you realized you lost your boodle?
Well, as I recall, it was, uh, Pierce, uh, Hunnicutt, uh Klinger, Radar and Father Mulcahy, like that there Recreating with officers, huh?
Start tampering with God's ways and the next thing you know $300 has taken a powder.
You're right, sir.
It's a curse from God.
Well, don't fear, soldier.
Nobody loses a dime while Frank Burns is at the tiller.
- Not too bad today.
- Who's complaining?
Pierce!
Hunnicutt!
That What do you think you're doing wearing civilian underpants?
Is nothing sacred?
These happen to be my mother's.
- Oh, really?
- They are.
She said as long as I wore them, nothing would ever happen to me.
She figured that, since nothing ever happened to her when she wore them.
I'm here to discuss something besides underwear.
- Make it brief.
- Ohh!
That's very bad.
Not funny, but fast.
- It has come to my attention that Sergeant Zale lost $300.
- Yeah.
So?
So that means that there's a thief around here.
Maybe more than one.
Frank, Zale lost it gambling.
- I beg your pardon?
- Gambling, Frank.
- He was playing poker with us.
- Impossible.
Gambling's prohibited.
There is no gambling in this unit.
Therefore the money was stolen.
- Can't argue with that logic.
- I certainly wouldn't try.
My mother always said, "Never argue with crazy people and wear clean underwear - in case you get run over by a tank and go to the hospital".
- Wise woman.
Okay, you two clever Dicks.
I'm gonna conduct a search as only I can, and the culprit or culprits will be punished.
Frank, your sanity's sprung a leak.
We'll see.
When I find that money, you'll be laughing out the other side of your sleeve.
- His mills grind slowly.
- But exceedingly dumb.
You may stand down, Captain.
We will now have a brief recess.
I think it's going very well, don't you?
Corporal Radar O'Reilly, sir.
- Radar?
- Oh, sometimes I know things are gonna happen before they do.
My mom says I get it from my Uncle Ernest.
He knew he was gonna die a week before it happened so he moved next to the undertaker so he wouldn't have so far to travel.
- Be seated.
- Yes, sir.
Is this all right, sir?
- Is what all right?
- The way I'm "sitted"?
You're "sitted" fine.
- You appreciate the gravity of this hearing, Corporal?
- Oh, yes, sir.
If eventually found guilty, Captain Pierce could be hanged.
- Why does he keep saying that?
- It'll never happen.
Probably.
Now then, Corporal.
You assisted Major Burns in his search for the $300?
Yes, sir.
Please tell the court the details from the beginning.
Well, our first stop was Father Mulcahy's tent.
He's the camp priest.
Prepare to search, Corporal.
Gee, sir, I don't think we should be in here.
It's like ransacking a church.
This isn't a church and I'm not ransacking.
Remember, he's a father but also a man and open to temptation like the rest of us.
You think he swiped all that stuff?
No, I don't think he swiped all that stuff.
I just figured if a priest could be tempted that's the kind of stuff he'd steal.
You know, you're a certifiable cretin.
- Cretin.
C-R-l-T-E-N.
Cretin.
- Wrong.
Hey!
He's got extras.
- What do you mean?
- I thought he had just one collar.
- What do you mean?
- I thought he had just one collar.
Why just one?
What do you think he did when it got dirty or wore out?
Converted?
The next tent we searched in was Corporal Klinger's.
Degenerate.
Now tell the truth.
Would you be caught dead in this?
- It's way too long for me, sir.
- You're another sicko.
I'm just searching for stolen money.
It could be hidden anywhere.
You didn't run your fingers through Father Mulcahy's collars, sir.
Sorry.
This Corporal Klinger She's a nurse?
Oh, no, sir.
If I may, sir?
Corporal Klinger is a corpsman.
He's a good soldier.
He'd prefer to be a good civilian.
- Toward that end he dresses, uh - In dresses.
Bucking for a Section Eight?
The man does his job.
I'll give him that.
I'm not saying I'd want an entire company of Klingers.
Unless, of course, Christian Dior attacks Pearl Harbor.
- Carry on, Corporal.
- Oh, yes, sir.
The next tent was Captain Pierce's and Captain Hunnicutt's.
- What're you looking for, Frank?
- His marbles.
Are you with him, Radar, or are you independently crazy?
- I'm helping the major.
-  Do what?
I don't know.
- He couldn't have gotten a better man.
- Come on, Frank.
You can tell us.
I'm looking for $300, bub.
As if you didn't know.
Frank, it wasn't stolen.
I don't really think either of you took it.
Officers don't steal.
- Right.
- We don't go to the toilet either.
We just explode when we're 50.
Finally, the major searched the last place.
Mine.
- Aha!
The eyes always give the guilty away.
-  They're the windows to the soul.
The little rat bit me!
What's he doing on a military installation anyway?
Oh, h-he pulls his weight, sir.
He's like a watchdog.
- And where'd the lettuce come from?
- The mess tent.
It's garbage.
That garbage is meant for our boys.
It's not to be used to feed gophers.
- He's a guinea pig.
- Who cares?
They do.
- Don't tell me he sleeps with you.
- I'm hoping to do better, sir.
In spite of his diligent search, Major Burns never found the missing money?
No, sir.
I know for a fact he didn't.
Because you had it all the time?
- You're sworn to tell the truth.
- Yes, sir.
I did, sir.
- Where was it hidden, Corporal?
- Inside my teddy bear.
I knew I should've ripped the stuffings out of the bugger when I had the opportunity.
Wouldn't you have felt silly if the money hadn't been inside?
I wasn't talking about the bear.
I think we have a pretty clear picture of the breakdown of command that led to the events of 11 October.
Now I would call on Major Burns to tell the court exactly what transpired on that day.
With pleasure, sir.
-  Kelly, let me see this.
- All right.
Here you go.
It was one of those days that, more than most reminds us that war, however much we may enjoy it, is no strawberry festival.
Nurse Johnson.
Nurse Johnson?
- You called, Doctor?
- More wounded.
Send me more wounded.
Major Burns, you're only human.
You've only got two hands.
If I have two hands, why have I only one patient?
I'm through here.
- Litter!
-   Buck up, Nurse.
Think of it as the rockets' red glare.
Come on, Frank.
Let up on us.
We've been going at it for six hours straight.
What about all these wonderful freckled youngsters?
Do you think they knocked off after six hours?
Or eight?
Or ten?
Do you think they punched out after 5.30?
- Thank you, Doctor.
- For what?
Just for being you.
Shameful.
Asleep at the switch.
Must I do everything myself?
- Oh, Lord, I'm losing this one!
- Steady, Pierce.
He's hemorrhaging and we're out of blood type "B".
- I'm type "B".
- No, Doctor, you mustn't.
- I must or be a traitor to my Hippocratic oath.
Take over.
- Yes, Doctor.
This'll probably save his life, Frank.
Saving lives is my business, mister.
Besides O.R., I was responsible for pre-op.
He's first.
You can wait.
He's next.
Give him a unit of whole blood.
Very bad.
I'll do this one personally.
Back to the front, soldier.
Keep 'em coming!
Gloves.
Come on, Frank.
Give us a break.
We're only human.
Are they less so, Hunnicutt, because they're bleeding?
Would you minister only to the healthy and able-bodied?
They're coming too fast, Frank.
We're not machines!
Shall I ask them to die slower?
We can't do it, Frank!
We can't!
You're asking too much!
I'm taking over!
You're mad!
Mad!
Mediocrity's no crime, Frank!
The major's version of what happened was, to say the least, fascinating.
It was, to say the most, perjury.
No, to be fair, I have no doubt that he remembers it that way.
More's the pity.
And, of course, there was some truth to what he said.
It was October 11 and we were in Korea.
Other than that  Hold it!
Hold it!
Dress him.
There's no double-parking here.
I can't put him to sleep.
He's in shock.
This patient isn't stable.
- Which of us is?
- I'm not kidding, damn it.
- I'm not operating till he gets a few units of blood.
- Same here.
I cut into this patient with his hemoglobin, he's gonna stroke out.
Frank, get in here!
Frank!
- Ow.
- Oh!
Watch it, clumsy!
In your ear!
Frank, this kid needs a transfusion and B. J.'s patient is likely to croak during his operation.
Pick, pick, pick!
Is that all you can do?
- Frank, what are you doing?
- He's adapted Henry Ford's principles to medicine.
He sends the wounded in on an assembly line and we're supposed to attach the headlights.
- Is that a bomb?
- No, Frank.
Someone's playing their World War II album.
Frank, pre-op means preparation.
Prep 'em!
Listen, they're backing up out there.
With all this shelling, there'll be more wounded!
We'll overflow!
We'll be buried alive!
That beats their being buried dead, Frank.
Now get out there and practice medicine or I'm gonna report you to Lionel Barrymore.
I'm your superior officer, Pierce!
You will not talk to me in that insolent manner!
Frank, you can either help the wounded or become one.
Thank you, Nurse.
You may just have saved countless lives.
- Father, take over in pre-op.
- Right!
- Klinger, get rid of this mess.
- Yes, sir.
!
Gentlemen, I have weighed the evidence carefully.
Not merely the testimony, but the records of those involved.
I have no doubt that Captain Pierce is a prankster and thoroughly unmilitary.
But the records indicate that he's a topflight surgeon.
Lord knows I wouldn't want to lead a company of Pierces into battle but I'd sure as hell want him around when that battle was over.
Colonel, what do the records indicate about my surgical skills?
If you hadn't been drafted as a doctor I think you'd have been assigned as a pastry chef.
In myjudgment, no case of mutiny exists and I'll advise that the charges against Captain Pierce be dropped.
- Court adjourned.
-   - You beat the rap.
- I owe it to clean living and fancy footwork.
- Congratulations, Pierce.
- Me too, sir.
Well, no hard feelings.
I guess it's not your fault justice got hoodwinked.
You can't be blamed for trying to save your neck.
- I have a bone to pick with that Colonel.
- Haven't you had enough?
Well, that's just it, sir.
I won't allow his innocence to be a blot on my record.
- Do you think we could sneak away and leave him here?
-  Frank's too sharp for that.
He always leaves a trail of bread crumbs.
Having wagered my life, this childish fort holds no challenge.
- No guts, huh?
- Or words to that effect.
- What're you gonna do, Sergeant?
- Don't rush me.
I'm thinkin'.
- Another first.
- A bluff if I ever heard one.
Did I tell you?
I never rescinded my order against gambling, and there they are, breaking it.
You know, I've been burned with three of a kind before.
- It's gettin' so I can smell a straight.
-  Two, three, four, five and five.
-  - A pair of fives.
- A crummy pair of fives!
- Bravo, Beej.
- You can win with a pair of fives?
-  Yes, sir.
In the immortal words of Napoleon, deal me in.
- New player, new game, gentlemen.
-  - Cards, please.

He may survive.
Are you kidding?
He went first class!
In that case, his luggage is probably in Cleveland.
Let's go.
- Sponge.
- Sponge.
Oh, thank you.
- You're very good, my dear.
Where'd you train?
- Bellevue, Doctor.
Lovely place, Bellevue.
I had an uncle who spent some time there.
Not a doctor, I'm afraid.
They caught him in the subway wearing mirrors on top of his shoes.
Can we get on with the operation and can the bugle oil?
It's very simple, Frank.
A lacerated artery adjacent to the lower femur.
- That's above the knee.
- Wise apple!
Do you want to finish for me, Frank?
It's an easy operation.
You can do it with your eyes closed.
Maybe you'd like to try one with your eyes open for a change.
- Vascular silk.
- Vascular silk.
- How's it goin', Doc?
- I say he's gonna have a boy.
Nurse King says a girl.
- Lacerated artery.
- Yep.
- I thought so.
That's easy.
- Did I tell you?
- Suture scissors.
- Suture scissors.
-  - Oh.
Give him some nitrous oxide.
Maybe we can get him to smile.
You're both a couple of ghouls.
I've got shots of every one of'em that lived.
It's a thing, like stepping on a crack.
If I take their picture, they live.
And like an idiot, I went to medical school.
What's his name, babe?
Corporal Howard Owens.
I think he's a repeater.
You're new here.
Lieutenant Cathy King, Lieutenant Jack Mitchell.
Why don't we step outside, Frank?
Leave the young folks alone.
- See you around later, Lieutenant?
- Unless the war ends.
- How many will this make for you, Jack?
- 839.
Dangerous Dan's got 842.
I need three to tie.
Oh, now, that's disgusting!
We're talking about the wounded he's brought back, Frank.
Hmm?
Oh.
Listen, is it too much to ask that we have some normal procedure in here?
I mean, really!
The O.R.'s not supposed to be some kind of coffee klatch where flyboys drop in to boast about their records which those of us on the ground could give less of a hoot about.
Or to promote a nurse, who is absolutely going on report at the very next smirk.
Or to stand around taking pictures of the wounded for scrapbooks, for Pete's sake!
- Major?
Smile.
- Hmm?
- Major.
- Captain.
Business is good, I see.
Certainly pays to advertise.
Shall we start our rounds?
I don't want to miss the ballet.
Hmm?
Uh, concussion from an 85-millimeter shell.
Jarred the right eye out of the socket.
- He replaced the eye himself without serious damage.
- Hey!
Trying to put us doctors out of work, sticking your own eye back in?
- Just happened to be the first one there.
- Good point.
Continue him on the penicillin.
Yes, Doctor.
Lacerated femoral artery.
B.P. Stable.
Temperature normal.
Good distal pulses.
Continue bed rest.
-  It's amazing.
- Pardon?
How Lois Lane never figures it out.
I know I'd recognize you if I saw you in your underwear and a cape.
- That's hardly likely.
- Just a thought.
- What's a thought?
- No.
Seeing the major in her underwear.
Why would you want to do that?
- Is this Corporal Owens?
Howard Owens?
- Right there.
- Corporal?
Corporal Owens?
- Frank, he's supposed to sleep.
- Corporal?
Corporal Owens?
- Frank, he's supposed to sleep.
This is a little more important than sleep, pally.
Look alive there!
"The president of the United States is proud to award Corporal Howard W. Owens the Order of the Purple Heart as a tribute to his devotion to duty and sacrifice made in the line of that duty - and in the face of the enemy".
-  - He's asleep with excitement.
- Come on.
Wake up, Owens.
Don't you understand?
You're getting the Purple Heart.
Sorry, sir.
This is my second one.
- Lucky pup.
I'd do anything to earn one.
- Short of getting wounded.
- Can we get on with it?
- I say we don't.
The patient needs rest more than decoration.
Why don't we present the medal with milk and cookies?
You are demeaning a military citation fraught with patriotism!
Heroism in battle must be rewarded or else people will behave the way they really feel.
A soldier must receive his medal so he will always remember just what a token our gratitude is.
Oh, give him the medal.
- Ow!
- Sorry.
Is everything all right?
You're fine.
All we have to do is keep the doctors away from you.
- You up to me yet, Radar?
- Hold your potatoes uh, Colonel, sir.
Uh, it's okay, sir.
Ready, uh - Read what we've got so far.
- Yes, sir.
"Major General Handley Wacker, Etcetera, etcetera.
Uh "Pursuant to your request, this is a formal apology for the behavior of Captain B.F. Pierce during your recent visit to MASH 4077.
I certainly agree that the captain was out of line when he showed up for the unit inspection wearing only an athletic supporter".
Sir, how many P's in supporter?
I've always found two were enough for me.
Oh.
- As you know - As you know it is very difficult to discipline doctors.
- Knock, knock.
- Jack Mitchell!
Son of a gun!
Smilin' Jack.
I haven't seen you since the 121 st Evac.
- You look terrific, sir.
Not a day older.
- So do you.
Well, whatever I've got that's old falls away hair, teeth.
I brought a kid in to get patched up and had to say hello.
Well, glad you did.
Listen, you old scrounger.
Where can I get some streptomycin?
I'm running low, and Supply is still trying to get stuff to Valley Forge.
I just might be able to lay me hands on a couple of cases.
Great.
I'll give you some - What can we spare, Radar?
- We've got eight gallons of DDT, sir.
Oh.
Then how about We've got a gross of tongue depressors.
- Didn't we get two cases of aftershave lotion?
- Aha!
The 8055th needs specimen bottles.
I'll take a case.
- Sir, we were gonna use 'em for that.
- Oh, give 'em to him, Radar.
We need the streptomycin.
We'll improvise.
We'll finish the letter later.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
Colonel?
- Now, that's a "cee-gar".
- From MacArthur's headquarters.
- Havana.
- Actually, it's a dozen thin Cubans rolled together.
Much "obleeged," Lieutenant.
I'll save this for after dinner.
On second thought, I'll have it for dinner.
Here you go.
It's good enough for MacArthur.
I'll probably develop an urge to walk on the water.
- What's this?
- Nothin'.
Isn't that where the Australian nurse scratched you?
Just 'cause I wanted to go home in her pouch.
- I patched that months ago.
- Who counts?
Sir, there was only half a case left.
- Honest.
- You owe me.
You still owe me for saying that was a battle injury.
You weren't lyin'.
- "Inspection" - Sit down, Radar.
Let's pick it up from athletic supporter.
As you know, it is very difficult to discipline doctors.
"And Captain Pierce is no exception".
Did I say that?
Uh, you were about to, sir.
The syringe is going to go up in the air, come down and stick in the orange, right?
- That's right.
- Never.
Uh-uh.
- That's what they said about the Wright Brothers.
- They hustle drinks too?
Oh, yeah.
They got that thing off the ground for a free scotch and water.
Double club soda, please, on their tab.
- There's a magnet in the orange.
- That's it.
He peels the orange, puts a magnet inside and then he glues the rind back on the orange without a seam showing.
- And I don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about.
- It's talent pure talent.
- Club soda?
- Uh-huh.
That'll stunt your growth, you know.
The bubbles settle in your feet.
I'll take my chances.
- I can do it.
- Oh, yeah?
- I'll bet you an honorable discharge.
- You're on.
-  Is that right?
- Mmm-hmm.
Colonel.
!
- How many club sodas did he stick you for?
- Two so far.
He took me for 17 one night.
Probably uses a loaded syringe.
You can use your own, sir.
Lieutenant Mitchell, pending completion of a thorough physical examination, you're officially grounded.
Sir?
I'm afraid that's an order.
Doctors, check him out.
- Am I gonna live?
- Another 50, 60 years tops.
You certainly look in good shape.
I could've had his physique.
I turned it down.
Hold it one second.
One more thing.
- What's this for?
- We're gonna toast the kaiser.
Someone swiped our specimen jars.
We were told to improvise.
Do the best you can.
- Come on.
You've got all you need.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Potter said a complete physical.
- It's on the house.
Come on.
Listen, I'm not fillin' it.
Go get your two cents back on the bottle.
- What does Potter suspect, Jack?
- Save us all a lot of time.
I take forever to heal.
I'm always thirsty.
Diabetes.
The needle.
You get a lot of practice.
I only need it once a day, sometimes twice.
-  Is that all?
- Well, sometimes three times.
- That's what Bela Lugosi said.
- Where do you get the insulin?
I can get anything.
I got insulin connections up to the yahoo.
- No problem.
- Yes, problem.
Oh, now I was gonna hand my wings in myself.
Dangerous Dan's got 842.
I only need three to tie.
Four to make chopper pilot of the year.
- You'll have to settle for Miss Congeniality.
- Sorry, Jack.
Nobody's gonna ground me yet.
Nobody.
Temp normal, B.P. Stable.
He can be shipped tomorrow.
Good.
About a week in Seoul and you'll be back in action, fella.
Yes, sir.
Oh, how I envy you.
Right up there in the heat of battle.
The smell of powder, the cannon's roar, Commies biting the dust.
We're really clobbering 'em now that we got 'em to the peace table.
You give 'em what for, soldier.
Frank, can we take his drains out before he reenlists?
The major was merely preparing the patient to return to the duty for which he was trained.
Why don't we just hit him on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper?
Major.
- How you doing, Owens?
- Okay.
Can I talk to you, Doc?
Why do you think I came to Korea?
You know anything about psychiatry?
Enough to know I'm not supposed to go steady with my mother.
A little.
I don't want to go back to the fighting.
Mmm.
Sounds serious.
You may be coming down with mental health.
This is the second time I've been clobbered.
This'll be the second time they'll put me back on the line.
- Have you ever been up there?
- Haven't had the pleasure.
The Chinese blow bugles and whistles.
They put up a racket.
Boy, it's scary.
Why don't I quit?
Go AWOL?
I just keep going back.
Like without me there's no war.
We all take orders.
Some take them better than others.
You're a good order-taker.
It's not a death wish, is it?
I read something about self-destruction.
You're not the self-destructive type.
Take it from the man who keeps putting his finger in the pencil sharpener.
-  - Sir?
Sir?
- Easy, Radar.
- Sir, it's Lieutenant Mitchell.
He took off.
He's gonna make a pickup down at the Battalion Aid Station.
Speaking of self-destruction.
- Is he the pilot that brought me in?
- Yeah.
- I hope they don't get him.
- If they don't, he will.
Radar, stay with him.
We were just talking about fear.
That's my best thing.
This is MASH 4077 calling chopper 17-Fox-Able-Charlie.
Come in, 17-Fox-Able-Charlie.
Do you suppose any of us will ever speak English again?
Do you read me?
Come in if you read me.
He is not supposed to be flying around up there.
- Maybe his arms will get tired.
- Hysterical.
I thought you grounded him.
I should've nailed him to the floor.
- Where'd you get that?
- The Petrified Forest.
They still open?
Chopper 17-Fox-Able-Charlie.
- That you, Colonel Potter?
- Jack, get back here.
- Can you hear me?
- Sorry, Colonel.
Worst you can do is send me home.
You're gonna do that anyway.
This is my last chance.
They're clobbering our guys here.
I can pick up four easy and break Dangerous Dan's record.
The thing is, you get conditioned, you know?
Yeah.
When I hear a twig snap, I think it's a North Korean creeping up on me, ready to slit my throat.
When I hear a twig snap, I think it's my Uncle Ed coming to catch me with my National Geographic.
You know, the African pictures?
When they sent me back to the evac hospital all the nurses there wore rubber-soled shoes.
At night, it sounded just like the sneakers the Chinese wear.
Really?
You're half sunk in the mud and you hear that squeak you know they're coming to get you.
I never sleep in the hospital.
Now they're sending me back.
Well, listen.
Maybe you should take this.
It's my lucky four-leaf clover.
It's a little squished.
I had it in my pocket when a Jeep ran over me.
But mostly it works though.
It makes you feel like nothing can happen to you.
- Can you spare it?
- Oh, sure.
I think I need less luck back here.
Gee.
You're a nice guy.
I used to get hit if I wasn't.
The first pilot I ever knew was Duncan MacShane, World War I. He used to fly low and throw grenades at his targets.
Pulled a pin on one grenade, threw it, and the wind dumped it back in his lap.
Oh, that smarts.
He tossed it out in time, but you couldn't tell him anything either.
Should I be hearing Arthur Godfrey?
Jack's vision could blur.
He could black out.
He's a sick man.
You realize if he crashes, it goes on my record.
Besides, he owes me two cases of streptomycin.
To get the four men he wants he's gonna have to put two inside with him.
- They'll have to be small.
- My draft board's taking Boy Scouts.
lfhe gets them on, there's no way he can take off.
175 horsepower just isn't enough to lift 'em.
If that character manages to get off the ground and bring back four wounded without killing them him or the chopper, I want him to get a medal.
Then I want him locked up.
Prep 'em.
We'll be right down.
!
That's it, Jack.
The sky's off-limits now.
Who cares?
I did it!
I did it!
843!
Chopper pilot of the year, possibly of all time!
Just to make sure you stay grounded, let's have it.
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
Anything.
Oh.
Sorry, Jack.
Guess I'll sell my club soda stock.
I hated to be the one to blow the whistle on you, Jack.
No sweat, Colonel.
A few sitting lessons and I'll be able to solo at a desk in no time.
- I'm not worried about you.
- I'll send you a box of cigars.
- I got nothing to trade.
- Just gift wrap a nurse.
- That's a deal.
- See ya.
We'll do triage here.
We may have a blood problem.
- Line up some donors.
- I'll tell Major Houlihan.
- Hey.
- I'm supposed to leave on this bus.
They gotta get the wounded off first.
I know you're working.
I just wanna say thanks.
And I hope I never see you again, you know?
Yeah.
Listen, just keep down low, huh?
Okay.
- Owens?
- Yes, sir.
- How's the leg?
- Fine, sir.
- Where you headed?
- Seoul for now.
Then probably back up to the front.
They're taking me out of the game.
Here.
Let me give you a hand.
Suppose the Gypsies switched them at birth?
- Not a very fair war.
- Contradiction in terms.
Roy, Dennis?
This one, stat.
We got more casualties coming, but the blood donors are lined up.
- Could you use a pint, extra sweet?
- On the bus!
A little respect, please, for the chopper pilot of the year.
I don't think so, sir.
- Dangerous Dan?
- Uh-huh.
He's bringing in two more.
You go scrub up.
I'll do triage from the pad.
I'll do triage up there!
Wildest pilot I ever knew, old Duncan MacShane.
Flew his plane through a hangar once, came out the other side turned around, did the same thing again.
The squadron leader yelled, "I thought I told you to put that plane in the hangar".
MacShane yells back, "I've had it there twice.
- Why don't someone lock the door"?
-   - Get quite a repertoire from three wars, eh, Colonel?
- Sad to say.
- Of the three wars, Colonel - Hmm?
Which would you say was the worst?
Attention all personnel.
By the close of today's fighting the 1 st Battalion of the Gloucester Regiment has lost an estimated 500 men of its 600-man complement.
Each and every one, Hawkeye.
Each and every one.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
## ##  Bored.
So bored.
So bored, it's boring.
Boring-a-ding-ding.
Boronus, boreetus, boreemus.
I came, I saw, I bored.
- Bored, she bored, they bored.
- All aboard.
- I was gonna say that.
- Sure.
-  Hello.
Hello.
- What?
What?
- Company.
- New nurses?
Or loaners.
Maybe the old ones are going into the shop.
This is the 4077 th.
Yeah?
Don't tell me.
Don't even think it.
- What's wrong?
- There are five MASH units in Korea three evac hospitals, I don't know how many aid stations clearing stations, hospital ships, whatever - and she had to land here.
- Which one?
The blonde on the right.
Very attractive.
Completely forgettable looks that stay with you forever.
- Sounds like we're getting into flashback country.
-   You gotta be kidding?
- What's that?
- You just hid.
- Who hid?
- You did, hid.
I haven't hidden since I was three.
Sometimes I'm sorry they ever found me.
You wanna talk?
We were involved for a time during my "regical surg" my, uh, surgical, uh, residency in, uh, Boston.
- Uh-huh.
- Wonderful girl.
Good kid.
You always react like this to good kids?
We were close.
Pretty close.
If I didn't see her every hour, I got the bends.
What happened?
- Nothing happened.
- You saw a lot of each other.
Couldn't help it.
We were living together.
- The plot thickens.
- Not long, a year, a year and a half.
Not long.
We had a small flat.
Painted it ourselves.
My hands were Hunter Green for a week.
Told everybody I was a tree surgeon.
It, uh, busted up sort of.
- You left her.
- The minute after she left me.
What's her name?
- Her name?
- I know you were young, but you must've had names.
- Carlye.
- Carlye?
Unusual.
Carlye Breslin.
Altogether unusual.
I don't I don't mind her being here.
No, I don't think I really mind at all.
Is that why you're reading Frank's diary?
I mean, she can't help being sent wherever those idiots send her.
It's just that of all the people to jump out of a Jeep in southwest Korea why the hell does it have to be her?
I think I'll check this out.
Find out how long she's staying, you know?
Maybe she's not even staying.
- Maybe it's not even her.
- Maybe you're not even you.
Right.
It's me.
It's her.
It's us.
- Radar, you busy?
- Uh, Major Burns says to fix the lights in surgery.
Right.
He's afraid to sleep in the dark.
Look at that.
Talent.
I'm not just a pretty face, right?
Especially since you started parting the hair on your legs in the middle.
Radar, two new nurses just turned up in the compound.
Sears Roebuck must have got my order.
Are they assigned here or are they passing through?
- They're all ours brand-new nurses.
- Be happy to check 'em out, sir.
Make sure they're assembled correctly, no missing parts.
There's a Walton, Carlye and an Anderson, Becky.
- Carlye Walton?
- You know her?
- Not by that name.
- Well, maybe it's a married one.
Says here married.
- What, was she not before?
- Lots of women are married.
My wife is married.
Somehow that makes her more exciting.
- You're weird.
- See you.
I didn't mean you.
"The national color for Korean men's clothing is white.
"In some localities, unmarried men wear their hair down.
- Married men wear a topknot".
A topknot.
- Yeah.
"The women wear full skirts, which hang from the waist and almost sweep the ground, and short jackets revealing their breasts".
- Well, that must flip a few topknots.
Read on, -  "A Korean house with bits of charcoal and pine twigs hung on a straw line outside signifies that a baby girl has been born.
And no one is allowed to enter for three weeks".
Oh, Korean baby girls take an incredibly long time to make up.
Must be.
-  -  Anybody home?
-  Men are here with your welcome.
- Oh, come in.
- How do?
- We greet you on behalf of the men, women and deviants of the 4077th.
I'm Becky Anderson.
- Carlye Walton.
- This is Captain B. J. Hunnicutt.
- What does "B.
J." stand for?
- Practically anything.
- This is Captain Hawkeye Pierce.
- "Hawkeye"?
That's from The Last of the Mohicans, isn't it?
- Give the little lady a cigar.
- Cigar.
We have anything you might conceivably want to smoke cigar, pipe, ham.
- Oh, gee.
Thanks.
- Think nothing of it.
My partner and I come with extra table leaves just so we can  extend ourselves for you.
Tell our first couple what else they've won, Fenneman.
This bar of soap from those who'll be working closely with you in O.R. - Please use at least once a week.
- Shampoo Because we couldn't find anything real poo.
- To be taken only internally.
- Thank you.
And last, but certainly most Five hundred sheets of the famous 4077 stationery.
Very handy for writing your lawyer.
It's obvious you've struck an officer or embezzled the company's funds or ravaged a corpsman.
Only creeps get sent to a MASH.
That's the end of our goodies.
If there's anything we can do to make your sentence bearable We're right across the road.
Tent's called "The Swamp".
Stop in for a drink after chow.
- Oh, thank you.
- Dinner here's around 7:00.
Nausea is around 8:00.
- I love him.
- Which one?
I don't care.
-  - Come.
- Lieutenant.
- Well.
- It is a swamp.
- We did it without a decorator.
- A little Hunter Green wouldn't hurt.
- Sorry, all out.
- Mm.
- I promised you a drink.
Yes.
Uh, You were right about the food here.
Yeah, I'll never understand how the cook get off at Nuremberg.
- You have your choice, gin or gin.
- I'll leave it up to you.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
To old friends.
Old friends.
-  It's pure poison.
- We think so.
- Oh, how are you, Hawkeye?
Are you well?
- How do I look?
A little thinner.
A little paler.
A few gray hairs.
These aren't mine.
I'm breaking in a friend's senility.
Has it been rough for you over here?
It's mostly kids you work on as if they machine-gunned a high school class.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Fine.
How do you stand on the subject of sitting?
- So - I was gonna say that.
- Tell me about Mr. Walton?
- Lieutenant Walton.
- Oh, military type?
- Yeah, naval officer.
Are you saying he's a lad in blue or an obstetrician?
He's patrolling off the coast in a destroyer.
Probably has the glass on us right now.
- Regular navy?
- No, he'll go back to advertising.
- Ah, advertising.
- Is that white smoke coming out of your ears mean you've just elected yourself pope?
- Any children?
- No, not yet.
We're still talking about that.
That's not how you get 'em.
I just read a paper on that.
- How about you?
- Children?
No.
I'm still my only child.
- No one has gotten you to wear a topknot?
- Huh?
- Is there a Mrs. Benjamin Franklin Pierce?
- My ring finger is clean.
I remain unbetrothed, my bachelorhood intact a solitary figure seemingly sentenced to single-ness.
You're trying too hard.
- Are you uncomfortable?
- I'll stop pressing.
Oh, may I have some more of this horrible stuff?
Obviously, you don't know a good antifreeze when you drink it.
I've thought about you, wondered how you were.
- What happened after you left?
- Well, mostly I got married.
But not to me.
When was the first, last or anytime in between that you ever asked me?
Carlye, I was in residency.
If I'd had two tails, I'd have worked them both off.
That was the greatest medical learning experience outside this non-stop butcher shop I could have.
- I couldn't get married then.
- Then or ever.
I was struggling, broke, remember?
- I used to fight the cat for scraps.
- Other men have done it.
What men?
You mean your Lieutenant Topknot?
- Doug.
- Doug.
Right.
Figures.
- Doug was struggling when we got married.
- Struggling in advertising?
What would've been the loss one less huckster persuading America its breath is bad that they're condemned to purgatory if their armpits don't smell like roses?
- I was training for medicine!
- If you had been less good at it you might have needed me a little more.
Doug is able to commit to something beyond his work.
Happily, I am that something.
There's been no one since you.
Faint copies at best.
I had to survive.
Right.
Here's to survival.
Oh!
Not if we keep drinking this.
It's gonna be difficult, isn't it being in the same hospital?
Not at all.
You're an excellent nurse.
I'm a fantastic doctor.
We're here to work just work.
- Can you do that?
- Watch me.
Right.
- Good night, Hawkeye.
- Good night.
Doug.
You've got to find yourself a hobby, Radar.
Something creative.
Like Eisenhower and Churchill and me, we all paint.
There's my impersonation, sir.
- I'm workin' on a turtle.
- A turtle?
Yes, sir.
Ku-shhh!
A turtle.
That's the best turtle I ever saw.
And then there's Al Jolson.
I seen him entertainin' the troops down in Seoul.
And now, folks, Jolie's gonna sing a little song for ya.
A song written by a dear friend of mine, Mr. Harry Warren on his honeymoon night in 1901.
A song of love and tenderness to his lovely wife, June.
On his honeymoon night, he wrote this song and it goes like this.
- You don't do him singing?
- Uh, not yet, sir.
Then hold still.
- Lap sponge.
- Lap sponge.
- One more.
- Yes, sir.
Well, you work fast around here.
Casualties have a tendency to multiply during truce talks.
- Clamp.
- Clamp.
- Hold it.
- Suction?
- When I say.
- Sorry.
There's a new word in your vocabulary.
Now, the suction.
Shall I ask not to be assigned to you in the future?
It isn't a dinner party.
You can't just rearrange the place cards.
Clamp.
- You get me when you get me.
- I'm just afraid of your voice giving me frostbite.
- There's no way we can avoid each other.
- Small camp.
- Small war.
- Have you thought of deserting?
There's a six-month waiting list.
You have to stand in line to go AWOL.
Pick-ups.
-  Can we talk?
- I'm trying.
Not here.
Later.
I know a little corner of Korea nobody ever uses.
- Is it formal?
- Black tourniquet.
- Oh, fantastic.
- I knew you'd like it.
Yes, it's very nice.
Early terrible.
Not fair.
You're insulting the place, and you've only been here five seconds.
Well, what's the record?
What have the other nurses said?
I never bring nurses here, except in an emergency.
- Fortunately - There's a constant state of emergency.
- Nah.
- Oh, I like the way you've done the floor.
We have someone to come in once a week with fresh dirt.
Care for a bottle of khaki champagne?
My, there's a lot of drinking here, isn't there?
Well, if truth's the first casualty of war I guess sobriety is second.
- I bet Hannibal crossed the Alps on pink elephants.
-  Here we are.
- A lovely Fort Dix '43.
- A-ha.
- Here's to what?
- To just being yourself.
I'm a little out of practice, but for you I was wrong, Carlye about what I said at first.
Our first first or this first?
When I said that you and I could just work together just work.
- That you were an excellent nurse - I'm not an excellent nurse?
No, no, no.
What l What Are you nuts?
You-You've got 24-karat fingers.
I don't see how I can behave like a normal human person around you unless l unless I get rid of some of that that unpleasant baggage I've been carrying around for years.
My name is on that baggage?
I hated you for a long time.
Passionately.
Hate.
The real thing.
If I'd met you during my celebrated blue period, I don't know what I'd have done.
- I know I hurt ya, Hawk.
- Hurt?
You broke my legs.
It really tore me apart when you left me.
There was no reason for you to feel that way, you know.
- You let it happen.
- Well, I still felt betrayed.
And mad as hell.
Finally.
Finally, finally, finally I thought I'd gotten over it.
I got over the hate but I never got over the love.
When you came into camp that first day I heard this strange sound.
It was my heart beating again.
One look at you and it got a jump charge.
I can't just just work around you.
It can't be the way that it was, Hawk.
It could be better.
Ohh!
Master complicator.
God forbid anything should ever be easy.
Give me a little side view, Klinger, more latissimus.
- Which part of me is that, sir?
- Your back.
- Better?
- Good.
You cold, Klinger?
You look a little blue.
I always look blue, sir.
It's my heavy beard.
- I started shaving when I was 12.
- That happens.
My sister started when she was ten.
- How's it comin' there?
- I'm gonna call this "Greek Athlete".
- Love to send my wife a copy.
- Next time I'll put a carbon under the canvas.
- Thanks.
- Hold still, please.
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- Come in, Father.
I'm just recreating.
At ease, Klinger.
- What can I do you for?
- Oh, I'd like your permission to return these, sir.
Quartermaster sent us a gross of new bibles and there seem to be quite a number of typographical errors.
- Oh?
- Uh, here's the first one.
"Thou shalt commit adultery".
Well, that's the new army, Father.
Well, let's hope it's a typo.
These lads are trained to take orders.
- Send them back, Father.
No sweat.
- Thank you, sir.
Okay.
About five minutes?
I'll be here.
Oh, boy, will I be here.
Thanks much.
Aha!
Giving our position away to the Nazis, eh?
That explains the submarine in the compound.
Radar set me up with a ham operator in Alaska, who's got a friend in Seattle who's gonna radio San Francisco to a guy who's gonna hook me up with Peg.
- You could swim to her quicker.
- Ah.
- File this under M.P., Medical Profile.
- Or Military Police.
- Or Member of Parliament.
- Or Married Person.
I haven't been home much the past few weeks.
Better, that way you miss me sobbing into my pillow.
- I think we're very happy.
- I think you'd probably know.
- You disapprove.
- Me?
You want disapproval, you disapprove.
I'm not the ACME Judgment Company.
A lot of married people are unfaithful.
I read that in the Cheater's Almanac.
- You?
Ever been unfaithful?
- Me what?
- To whom?
- Well, who could you be unfaithful to?
- Myself, for openers.
- No, no.
Come on.
You know what I mean, to your wife.
- Have I ever strayed?
- Ever checked in somewhere without a toothbrush.
- Never.
- Never been tempted?
- Tempted's another subject.
- Ah, you have been tempted.
Never.
But it's another subject.
- You rat.
-  Hello!
Hello!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll wait.
Uh, look, uh minding my own business is a full-time job.
In my spare time, it's my hobby.
I can't divide myself emotionally.
I, uh I couldn't break my word to Peg.
And not because God'll send me to hell without an electric fan or because it's not the right thing to do.
- I simply don't want to.
- You've got a lot to learn about messing up your life.
I'm sure.
Peg?
Peg, it's me!
- Hawkeye, I've been lookin' for you.
- A little louder, darlin'.
- We've got half a world between us.
- I just got it.
Perfect.
I can hear you just great.
Is this any better?
- How are ya, darlin'?
- Fine.
-  - Come in.
- Oh, hi.
- "Hi"?
I just found out you put in for a transfer.
"Hi"?
You'd have to use a divining rod to find a "hi" in me.
Oh, Radar doesn't waste any time, does he?
Radar's my informer.
He's my snitch, my friend, my helper.
- If he could fly.
He'd be my falcon.
- I was going to tell you.
- I wouldn't have just slipped away.
- It's always worked before.
Oh, you're still working on last time?
Last time turns out to be a warm-up for this time.
- What are you telling, Potter?
- The truth.
I can't stay here with you with me, the way we are again.
"Be yourself," you said!
Well, myself happens to love you.
What can I do?
- I love you.
- Oh, now, I understand!
Since we're in love, there's no possible reason for us to stay together.
The third casualty of war has to be fidelity.
- Third now and moving up fast.
- I've always been honest with Doug.
- So don't stop!
- He'll want a divorce.
- Then it'll be just you and me.
- Oh, what does that mean?
What does that mean?
That means we'll be together!
We'll enjoy each other!
We'll revel in each other!
Oh.
What is it really?
Uh, I know.
I see.
I know.
I know.
I know.
Look.
Look.
There was a time when I couldn't ask you because that But that was then, this is now!
We're two different people.
I know I certainly am.
I think I can handle it now.
Huh?
Sure!
Of course, I can.
Listen.
Why shouldn't we?
Why couldn't we?
- Let's just Let's!
- Hawkeye!
- What?
- Lo-Look at yourself!
Look where you are!
You're trapped!
You just proposed yourself into a corner.
- So?
How ever I did it, I did it.
- You didn't propose to me!
- You proposed to yourself!
- I wanted to try it out on me first.
- Did you hear yourself?
- No, what did I miss?
If you'd gone into medicine with the same lack of conviction that you seem to have about marriage, you'd have been a mortician's delight.
What should I do, go down on one knee?
No, no, no, no.
The only convention I care about is the convention where two people can't live without each other.
Y-Your work is always going to be the most important single thing in your life.
That's fair!
That's how it should be.
You're very gifted.
I just don't want to take a backseat again.
I like it up front.
- You're smart.
- Mm.
Sometimes.
We don't have to say good-bye now.
It's, uh - A transfer takes a week or so.
- Well, I asked them to rush it.
Oh.
- Do me a favor, huh?
- Yeah.
If anybody asks, I turned you down.
Right.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
You're not thinking.
- I am.
G.R., right?
- "G.R.," right.
- An actor.
- An actor.
- A living American actor.
- Right.
- G.R., George Raft.
- He's just a living American.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Uhh.
- Gene Raymond.
- Nope.
- Uh.
Gregory Ratoff.
- Nope.
- Ya give?
- Give.
Gerald Rassmussen.
- Who is Gerald Rassmussen?
- He was my high school drama teacher.
Terrific actor.
- Who ever heard of him?
- Everybody, if he hadn't died.
- You said living American.
- If I'd said dead, you'd have guess Gerald just like that.
- You're mental.
- Care to try again?
Later.
Next month.
I love the way she drops into my life every few years - just to give me a little open heart surgery.
- It's got to be rough.
I'll live.
In some ways, I don't mind that she's gone again.
It's just that she never altogether leaves.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Here he is at Plymouth, England with this to say about our G.I. 's in Korea.
Now, I have not the knowledge to enable me to predict how this Korean fighting will end.
But But let me here express our admiration for the daring and skill with which the handful of American soldiers three or four battalions at most who have as yet been brought into action in Korea have fought their delaying action against overwhelming odds.
I really wasn't expecting more wounded!
General MacArthur said the fighting would be over by Christmas.
He didn't say what year.
He was referring to the fighting between himself and Mrs. MacArthur.
She's got a different idea on how the war should be run.
- This is not a war.
It's a police action.
- Why didn't they send cops?
A night rendezvous inside Wonsan Harbor with a stubborn Communist fort.
A spectacular display of rocket firepower.
Look, Colonel.
A hospital's got to know what to expect.
If there's a push on, give me some warning.
We're both in the same war, you know.
I'm not over here because I'm such a fan of diarrhea.
Now if you hear any Hello?
Colonel?
Colonel.
- Creeps.
- Who, sir?
Colonels.
You can't trust'em.
They're this far from making general.
They can taste those stars.
They'll do anything to get 'em.
Never mind if they don't deserve 'em if they don't know their brass from their elbows.
Captains and majors are okay.
They're too far away.
They don't have to make points.
And generals usually relax once they've made it although I had one in the cavalry ordered all horses corked before parades.
- Is that a beak?
- Uh, it's chicken, sir.
It's sort of a beak stew.
- That's surplus.
- Yes, sir.
Take it away.
I sent this dinner back in World War II.
Ambulance to the upper helipad.
Ambulance to the pad.
Incoming wounded.
South Korean infantry.
South Koreans are getting younger.
Complain to Syngman Rhee.
#Ah, sweet Syngman Rhee of life at last I found you #  Can the balloon juice, Pierce!
Close.
Bad belly wound.
Got an arterial pumper.
- Need some help?
- You bet.
- Get me some gloves.
- Lap sponge.
Clamp.
I'll try to expose the bleeder.
I've been around overseas at different times, visiting our boys.
They're a swell lot doing a wonderful job to protect us here at home.
Many of them get wounded or suffer from loss of blood, shock.
And blood or blood plasma given in the field means life itself.
Yes, just that.
Please, don't let those army, navy airmen and marines down.
Have a heart.
Give some blood.
- Ow.
Ah!
- Father, irrigate his eye.
- B. J., you okay?
-  I've got it, B. J. - Talk about your bloodshot eyes.
-  Retract that.
Excellent.
A page-one retraction.
Ah.
Ah, that's better.
Thanks.
Pretty good with your hands, kid.
Can you get me a tracheotomy at the Garden?
Let's try a couple of hernias out of town first.
Get all their personal possessions, Corporal.
Make sure they get a receipt and file copies of your copy in triplicate.
Major, I done this a hundred times.
I write to my mother in triplicate.
I got triplicate on the brain.
Somebody wants change for a ten, I give 'em three fives.
- Get moving.
- Yes, ma'am, times three.
- Hey, Major, I already gave my things.
- What?
- My personal effects, right?
- Yes.
I already gave 'em to some guy outside.
Tsk!
You've been robbed, soldier.
A wounded soldier robbed in the middle of a war.
I don't know what's happening to this army.
Me either.
That does it for me.
One more week, and I'm through!
At Laramie, the chief executive speaks to the students at the University of Wyoming.
It's a fatherly talk.
I hope you will all make the most of your opportunities here to fit yourselves to be good citizens of the United States the greatest republic the world has ever seen.
Father, you got a second?
- Are you all right?
- That's my problem.
I'm all right.
Least the doctor said I was.
I don't think I understand.
When I got hit on the line I thought for sure I was gonna die.
I had no idea they was gonna pick me up and fix me so fast.
Well, we have the fastest docs in the West.
Yeah, well, the thing of it is when I was out there layin' there, not knowin' I made a promise to God.
I said, "Dear God, you get me out of this, and I'll become a priest".
And he got you out of it.
And I don't wanna be a priest.
You think he'll understand?
If everyone who promised to take the vow in a moment of stress made good there'd be so many of us around it'd look like the priesthood had had a population explosion.
Let me put that another way.
He'll understand.
Ah, thanks for letting me chew your ear, Father.
That's what they're there for.
- Got a chest or a belly wound?
- Legs.
You can have a beer.
Compliments of the doctors.
- I'd rather have some scotch.
- You're too young to drink.
You're lucky you didn't have to show your I.D. To get shot.
Clean out the sink.
In the middle of a war, I couldn't care less who wins.
For my money, I'll give you Red China and six points or the other way around, and now they got me scrubbin' sinks.
It's crazy, right?
No.
Being in is sane.
You know my problem?
I played hard to get.
You do that, and the army's got to have you.
Kid from my neighborhood really nuts Archie Jagloff.
He fell into a sewer when he was little.
He was always a little jerky after that.
Grew up to be a Nazi.
No kiddin'.
Tried to volunteer, join up.
Couldn't wait to come here, drop anything from an "A" bomb to a "Z" bomb.
The army turned him down said he had flat feet.
You know how he got flat feet?
Goose-steppin' in his basement.
Me they had to have.
I said I was nuts.
They said, "What's your religion"?
I said, "Aztec".
They said, "Stop joking".
I said, "Bring me a virgin.
I'll cut her heart out".
They looked into my ears.
I said, "Ah".
They said, "Stick out your tongue".
I pulled down my pants.
They called in the psychiatrist.
I kissed him on the mouth.
Know what the guy in charge said?
"Keep this up, and we'll make you an officer".
Right through here.
Watch the door.
Right through here.
Watch the door.
- Is it clean?
-  You gonna operate in the sink?
We have to work underwater.
He's got phosphorus burns.
It's in the tissues.
If it hits the air, it can ignite.
Next thing, you got G.I. Flambe.
The guy could catch on fire?
Wow.
- We're gonna need more sulfa.
- We're low on sulfa.
We've got enough saltpeter for World War IX.
- Does that stuff really work?
- Search me, fella.
- What's happening?
- Cleaning the wound.
Debriding the necrotic or loose tissue.
I don't know how you guys do it.
Helps a little if you think you're God.
Over there.
All right.
I think that's all.
Copper sulfate.
This stuff coats and neutralizes the little bits of phosphorous that might still be in the leg.
- It helps to see where they are.
- How do you keep all that stuff in your head?
- You wear earplugs so it doesn't leak out.
- Turn off the lights.
Observe, Klinger.
The solution fluoresces, and we take out whatever shines.
Like so.
And so.
And thus.
And this.
Lights.
- And the sulfa.
- Here.
- We'll leave the wound open.
Get him a bed.
- Right.
Boy, seeing the way you guys work with the wounded the way you deal with burned-up legs, ripped-up bellies makes me proud every time I throw up.
A mop-up expedition directed at rooting out a band of Vietminh Red terrorists who have made the swamp their hideout.
Another Asian country brought to violence and bloodshed by Communist conspirators who have to be flushed like rats.
Take good care of him, Doc.
- Friend of yours, Radar?
- Somebody said he's from Iowa.
He's not from Iowa anymore.
Litter!
Gloves.
I can't believe the traffic.
- One short, Doctor.
- Don't tell me.
No.
You used 11 sponges, and we've only removed 10.
- Hotshot left a sponge in.
- Not now, Major.
What's the matter with the big honcho?
Losing his touch?
- Knock it off, Burns.
- I just wanna see if Dr. Perfect takes it as well as he dishes it out.
One more word, Frank, and I'll button your lip to your fly.
- That was close.
- One of our mines.
Weather changes set 'em off.
- Are you sure about that sponge count?
- Yes, Doctor.
Amazing what can get stuck in the human body.
My sister-in-law Rose swallowed a dried apricot at her bridge club.
Ten minutes later, she drank a glass of water.
The fruit expanded to its original size, lodged in her duodenum.
They rushed her to the hospital called me and I had to perform an "apricotectomy".
- A little suction.
-   Attention, all personnel.
According to supreme headquarters the Army of the People's Republic of China has hit and ruptured the entire United Nations line.
The Chinese have attacked with 33 divisions.
That's, uh, 300,000 men, folks.
According to headquarters, we now face an entirely new war.
That's for those of you who were tired of the old one.
- Doctor.
- Oh, good.
That's Chinese for "thank you".
No sense wasting time.
##  - Radar?
- Here.
- Have the nurse start some plasma, stat!
- Lieutenant Gage!
There are four other MASHes.
Call to see if they can give us some help.
- I got it.
- They're flocking in here like we got a white sale.
- X rays.
- Lieutenant, litter number one.
We want plasma, stat.
Okay, you can sit on a bench out there.
Don't run any races.
I found this in his pocket.
He was going on leave tomorrow, to Tokyo.
And so he will.
Again, my thanks and deepest appreciation from both Mrs. MacArthur and myself for your heartwarming reception.
We shall never forget it.
You have made us feel that we are indeed home.
I, for one, am glad the Chinese have finally gotten into the show.
- We'll obliterate them all.
- All 600 million, Frank?
Most of'em don't wanna be Reds anyway.
- Then why kill 'em?
- Well, they can't have it both ways.
The people are here to watch famous folk in the National Celebrities Golf Tournament in Washington.
And Milton Berle clowns with Danny Kaye.
- Now look at me.
Look at me.
-  Easy does it, Danny Boy.
- Burns.
- Sir?
Be sure not to sew up any contaminated wounds.
Is the colonel suggesting my work is careless?
Not at all.
I just know how hard it is to operate and be secretary of state at the same time.
Now Danny addresses the ball, and it turns out to be the wrong address.
And here comes Bob Hope, the casual and clever comedian contriving to perform a putt with pool-like perfection.
How about that?
Um, sir, are you busy?
Just putting a new hinge on this bladder, Radar.
- What is it?
- Uh, cook wants to know how you feel about the dinner.
- Mostly nauseous.
- It's just that he's got some wounded in the mess tent and he's not sure what to do.
Did you call about the plasma?
- The lines are all jammed.
- Unjam 'em.
- Yes, sir.
-  Radar.
- What happened to your glasses?
- Oh, I slipped and fell on the bus.
- It's kind of bloody.
- Can you see?
Oh, yes, sir.
Everything just a few times more than I'm used to.
I sort of know how a fly feels.
- Get on the plasma, Radar.
- I'll get on the plasma.
Hey, put out that cigarette.
There's a lot of ether in there.
- Hey, I'm a sergeant, fella.
- And I'm a captain, fella which means if we're blown up, I'll fly higher than you.
- So put it out.
- Sorry, sir.
This area is only for hospital personnel.
- I got a buddy in there.
- Everybody's got a buddy in there.
We'll keep you posted.
Let you know the minute it's a boy or a girl.
Hi, Dusty.
Yeah, it's Radar.
Oh, I'm fine.
Well, not really.
I'm closer to lousy than fine.
Listen, Dusty.
We got a terrible plasma problem here.
No, plasma.
Yeah.
All of our stock is over 21 days old.
We're not supposed to use it then.
- H-How's your outfit fixed?
-  No kidding.
Hey, listen.
Maybe we can make a swap then, huh?
Let me get my quartermaster sheet out here.
Hey, we got rain here.
You too?
Wonder why the army ordered that.
Okay.
Hold on now.
Listen.
This is gonna be a little rough, Dusty.
I broke my glasses, and it's like looking through an ice cube.
Uh, how would you like some, uh Wait a minute.
Hey, would you like some jeep butter?
No.
No.
That's, uh Uh, jeep batteries.
We got two extra.
No, huh?
Well, let's see.
We got Bunsen burners, throat swabs.
Hey!
You can't pass this up.
The quartermaster made a mistake and sent us 5,000 extra rolls of toilet paper.
Yeah.
Well, I know it's a lot but maybe you could start your own newspaper.
Colonel Potter, I want to see you.
One step closer, and you'll get the whole picture.
I just heard something disturbing, and if it's true I'm afraid I'm going to have to fight you.
- You might at least let me get into my trunks.
- It can't wait.
Well, fire ahead then.
Is it true you might ship us out the nurses?
Major, the Chinese are pouring over the border like the country's sprung a leak.
It's a drastic situation.
The nurses have to be evacuated.
- Colonel, you don't understand.
- It won't be the first time.
The service is my life.
I was born in an army hospital.
- Started in khaki diapers, eh?
- Mother and I followed Dad to every army post he was assigned to Benning, Ord, Dix, Kilmer.
The army was all I knew.
I had no idea what a civilian was.
I thought it was somebody waiting for his uniform to come back from the cleaners.
When I was five, I had a crying fit because they wouldn't let me have a crew cut.
I was born to serve, Colonel.
You must let me!
I'd rather not have the nurses in the path of the fighting.
I can look after my girls.
- Things could get ugly.
-  Uglier than our own mines trying to kill me?
Uglier than rats mating in my duffel bag?
I get your point.
Arriving in New York, Rita Hayworth film queen who became a real-life princess by marrying the heir of the fabulous Aga Kahn.
You know, the first thing I'm going to do is go out and get myself a hot dog.
I'd like to give you about 20 more sutures, pal but business is just too good.
Okay, Lieutenant, he's ready to reenlist.
- Fresh gloves.
Somebody, please.
- All out, sir.
- I beg your pardon.
- That's it for the gloves.
They're torn, shot, finished, eighty-sixed.
How can a hospital run out?
How can we operate without gloves?
Meet Dagwood, a female feline featuring prodigious prowess at Ping-Pong in Portland, Oregon.
The amazing mouser reveals fantastic finesse.
Dagwood is just purring along.
The eight-year-old tabby can really volley, by golly.
And the score is now one-itch.
Dagwood, you're really the cat's whiskers.
How about 400 thermometers?
Oh, they make nice Christmas decorations.
You know, they look like little icicles.
Oh.
Well, wait a minute.
We'll find something.
Hey!
Hey.
You ever, uh, read The Tropic of Cancer or The Tropic of"Coppercan"?
They're the books.
But I mean books.
Yeah.
They're published in, uh, France.
Yeah!
Do I need to tell ya any more?
They're really somethin'!
No kidding.
They'll get you through the war without a leave.
Really?
Ah, terrific!
Yeah.
Okay.
How much plasma do l do I get?
I'd hate it here without the nurses.
- They're the only reason I stay.
- This isn't bad.
- What is it?
- You didn't know him, Father.
"A soldier of the legion lay dying in Algiers.
"It was a lack of woman's nursing.
There was a dearth of woman's tears".
Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton.
- You know a lot of poetry.
- I went through school on a scholarship from Burma Shave.
- You know any?
- I got a beaut, but not in front of the father.
Oh, Hawkeye.
You know, Father standing there with the light hitting you the way it does - Yes?
- You look just like a "B" girl I knew in San Diego.
It's quite possible.
I worked my way through divinity school as a "B" girl in San Diego.
Oh, Father.
Look out, Dagwood.
Hey, I fell asleep.
- Where can I find my buddy?
- Your buddy's got a name?
- Bender.
Jack Bender.
- Try the hospital.
- Where's that?
- Two doors down.
It's a beautiful white building with the statue of Lionel Barrymore in front.
Hit me with the alcohol, Margaret.
Barehanded surgery.
Now practicing the Tarzan School of Medicine.
Room seems to have a weak bladder.
- I smell something burning.
- I do hope it's not the crepes.
- Watch your language!
- Clamp.
Criminy!
Klinger, look at that!
- How'd that happen?
- How do I know?
Douse it, will ya?
Stand back.
- Hey, are you crazy?
- I thought it was water.
- It's alcohol.
- Can you imagine what that does to your stomach?
You moron!
I have to do everything myself!
The laundry is on fire.
I was wondering when things would get interesting.
- Is it under control?
- Well, O'Reilly and Klinger are working on it.
- It'll be fine.
- Holy mackerel!
- The blind leading the blind.
-  Nice thought for a hospital, Frank.
Never at a loss for the wrong phrase.
Why don't we go outside where it's dry and work?
Corpsman, another bucket here.
- Thank you, Major.
-  - Help!
I'll get some light!
- What happened!
- Bulb got wet!
Glass in the patient!
- Father, more pickups.
-  Pickups coming up.
- Thanks.
Colonel, I don't know how to tell you this, but I've had a better offer.
Take me with you.
The fire's out.
There's nothing to worry about.
Sandwiches -  - Cover the patients!
What are you doing?
It took me three weeks to requisition that!
-  -  Holy cow.
!
Attention, all personnel.
By direction of the secretary of the army under AR220315 the Meritorious Unit Commendation is awarded to the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, 4077 unit for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services.

Just wanted to thank you for staying.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
The following is in black and white.
This is a room in Korea a room most of the men fighting the second year of the war would rather not see.
This is an operating room in a MASH a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital.
There are five of these units in South Korea.
The concept of treating wounded close to the front this particular hospital is just three miles from the fighting is being tested for the first time.
If anything can be said to be a success in war, it is this concept.
By bringing the wounded directly to the operating table by jeep, ambulance and helicopter these units have achieved an effectiveness of 97%% .
In human terms, 97 out of every 100 wounded men brought here live.
Who are the people behind that most impressive statistic?
We brought our camera and our microphones here to find out.
Some of their saltier comments have been deleted.
Do you see anything good at all coming out of this war?
Yeah.
Me.
Alive.
That would be nice, if I could get out of this alive.
That would be great.
- You've been here some time.
- Somewhere between some time and eternity.
Is there anything from home that you brought over with you to set up for yourself?
Creature comforts?
- I brought I brought a book over.
- What book?
The dictionary.
I figure it's got all the other books in it.
I like to read the dictionary.
What do you feel was the most difficult thing you had to adjust to over here?
I think it's that everything is painted green.
The clothes are green.
The food is green except the vegetables, of course.
The only thing that's not green is the blood.
The blood is red.
That's what you get the most of here.
Number one with me is the toilet seats.
They give you slivers and splinters.
You can't really reach around and take them out yourself.
Boy!
That's when you find out who your friends really are.
Ha!
The almost criminal lack of respect of military respect and discipline.
Some say that's too much to expect of doctors.
I don't see any harm in doctors being ordered to behave as patriotically as possible.
Doesn't patriotism have to come from the heart?
I don't have that problem.
You gotta understand.
I'm not working on sick people here.
I'm working on hurt young people with essentially healthy bodies that have been insulted by ammunition.
What's the attitude of the boys towards you, towards your work?
I try to get to know them, but then there's so many.
They move through here pretty fast.
At least we hope they do.
I do hold services, but, uh, well, they I don't pack 'em in, you know.
Not Not that that's important.
They spread us religious fellows rather thin over here.
'Course they spread everything kind of thin over here.
I'm not complaining.
I don't mind being the only priest here.
It's sort of fun to have a corner on the market, but Well, uh What was the question?
A lot of the boys look up to you as a father figure.
Do you get that feeling?
I suppose they do, and that gets to be a pain in the  too.
I don't mean that in a nasty sort of a way.
I know it's perfectly natural.
That's what I think part of my duty as a commanding officer is.
To accept that, and to give it back in the best way that I can.
What do you do when you're not working?
Then I specialize in boredom.
There must be a good deal of that.
- And let's not forget fright.
- Tell me about that.
The fright or the boredom?
We have a special on boredom this week.
Tell me about the boredom.
- Do you mean what do I do when I'm bored?
Is that - Yeah.
What do you do?
Uh, well, um I mostly do the same thing I do when I'm not bored, only I do it slower.
Bored.
How many times can you watch those training films they send over here?
V.D. Is the Enemy and Don't Let This Happen to You.
I'd like it to happen to me to break up the boredom.
Just kidding, honey.
You got a little woman back home?
I'm married, yeah.
LaVerne Esposito.
Terrific gal.
Great gal.
She went to Toledo Waite High School.
That's on the Hungarian side of town.
Incidentally, if you're ever in Toledo, Ohio, on the Hungarian side of town Tony Paco's greatest Hungarian hot dogs, with chili peppers, 35ct.
And a cold beer Stroh's Bohemian.
And El Verso cigars.
Well, I, uh - I don't know if this is interesting or anything.
- Go ahead.
Uh, I grow earthworms.
I, uh, dug a ditch like a trench out behind the O.R. I filled it up with peat moss and stu Well, not exactly peat moss, 'cause I couldn't requisition any.
So, what I did was Well, l I took Well, you know when they re-dig the latrine Can you say "latrine" on television?
Let's find out.
Well, anyhow, there's lots of ash and stuff, you know.
I took that stuff, and I put it in the hole.
Then I went looking for some earthworms.
I put them in there.
You know, earthworms double in 60 days.
They must really be in love.
Oh, there must be 160,000 And now what happens?
Well, I figure I'd give most of them away to the farmers around here 'cause they need all the help they can get.
And, uh, earthworms are really good with dirt.
Is this too technical?
- No, no.
Go ahead.
- Well, uh I figure I'll give most of them to the farmers, and the rest I'll race.
You race earthworms?
- Yeah.
I got this cockroach in a jar, you know?
- Yeah.
I didn't name him or nothing.
He's just number six.
One through five died.
Or maybe number six ate them.
I don't know.
They're pretty hard up too, you know?
Cockroaches.
Over here.
Anyhow, I put him in this track with the worm, and then I race 'em.
Unlike most of your doctors, you're regular army.
This is my third war.
I was in the big one and the Second World War and now Korea.
I hope war is getting smaller as a trend.
I've been asking if something special is coming out of this in the way of medical or technical developments.
Oh, there are some things that get a practical trying-out here that maybe wouldn't with the same speed back home.
But when you counterbalance that with the frightful expense the frightful destruction and loss of life, I don't think it's an equal balance.
Do you see anything good coming out of this?
Not a damn thing.
I mean, Korea will become a shining example of the American policy of benign military intervention.
I think it's the most stupidest thing in the world.
You call it a police action back home, right?
Over here, it's a war.
"A police action" sounds like we're over here arresting people handing out parking tickets.
War is just killing.
That's all.
Do you get scared, frightened?
Yeah, very frightened.
Very frightened.
- What do you lean on then?
- Mostly terror.
There's always terror to fall back on.
You know what it's like?
It's like a car accident.
You know, everything goes into slow motion?
You suddenly see things for the way they really are.
You say to yourself, "Oh, so that's what it's like to have a bomb explode a few feet away from me".
Do you ever get hit here?
Oh, they bombed the crap out of us a number of times.
Uh, there, it's al it's The beams shake, and the dust falls into your patient.
It's not nice.
Any other times you were afraid?
At night.
Sometimes at the beginning of the night, sometimes before dawn.
When you realize that you're not sleeping, and you suddenly begin to think of where you are and what could happen to you.
Then you notice that the cot is shaking.
You wonder why the cot is shaking.
It's because your heart is pounding.
Sometimes I get frightened for the patients we have to handle these young kids that come in all shot up.
It's very difficult to observe all this and not occasionally be scared by it.
How would you describe yourself?
Are you a captain in the U.S. Army Reserves or are you a civilian in uniform?
I'm a temporarily misassigned civilian.
Can you describe what you do?
Essentially, I'm on call for all medical emergencies but I've never seen a situation here that wasn't an emergency.
I did three amputations before I had my first breakfast here.
Our surgeons, uh, do what needs to be done.
Anesthesiologist one day, orthopedist the next.
Psychologist pretty much all the time.
How in the world do you keep your morale up?
I stopped having morale about six months ago.
- It's not really morale you have here either.
- What is it?
- Is it pure survival instinct?
- Yes.
Yeah, yeah.
It's like an overcoat that I take out every once in a while and put on.
See, what I do is, I try to provoke other people into disbelief.
Then when I see that disbelief in their eyes, then I know I'm here.
Otherwise it's like looking into a mirror and not seeing anything.
Everybody's got that self-involved glaze over their eyes a little bit.
They all have their own problems, you know.
I think what it's like is, uh, like what Milton Berle does for people.
They just can't believe it.
It gives them something to look at for a while.
It's like a public service.
How do you manage to stay sane over here?
There are certain tricks to staying sane little things you can do.
For instance, if you wear your underwear outside your pants for three days straight just to see who notices that's a very good way of staying sane.
- Is there anything from home - Actually, another thing you could do is you could get out in the road there, where the jeeps are coming by and everybody stick your foot out in front of the jeep.
The last one to pull his foot in is the sane one.
How did you pick the military as a career?
I got into the cavalry as a kid, excited by the glamour of it.
Then I went into medicine.
I don't say it isn't, and hasn't been, especially in the olden days, a glamorous occupation particularly the cavalry, which was very romantic.
But remember those were the days of Douglas Fairbanks and Francis X. Bushman too.
I love horses.
I'd rather spend a day with a horse, still, than most of the people I know.
- Has this whole experience changed you in any way?
- Certainly not.
I may care about things more than I ever have before, because, uh there's so much more to care about here.
On the other hand, I really don't give a  what happens.
Just doesn't matter anymore, I think.
I mean, I've seen so many people to whom killing is a casual thing.
I don't know how we manufacture people like that, but it, uh It seems to me that we'll never run out of them.
When I first came here, I couldn't walk down a corridor full of wounded people without being sickened by it.
Now I can walk down without noticing them.
You have to use a mental anesthesia.
Otherwise you bleed for everybody who's bleeding the refugees, the orphans the wounded children, the other doctors and nurses.
If you get caught up in their misery too deeply, you get into a hole you can't climb out of.
When the doctors cut into a patient and it's cold, you know the way it is now, today steam rises from the body and the doctor will will warm himself over the open wound.
Could anyone look on that and not feel changed?
Captain, what about authority?
You have respect for authority over here?
That's what really killed me when I first came over here.
There were so many people who thought they had a right to tell me what to do.
That really was amazing.
I never saw anything like that.
My shoes!
You'd be surprised how many people are interested in shoes when you come into the army.
You don't meet many people out in the real world who are interested in shoes the way they are in the army.
It's a fascination for them.
You might even say a grand obsession.
It's pretty hard to have the kind of authority here you would have in a regular army unit, because these guys aren't soldiers.
They're doctors.
And, uh, you just can't handle them the way you would regular army men.
And I don't want to because the results wouldn't be what we're getting now.
Can you tell me about the people with whom you're working?
Finest kind.
Everybody is terrific here.
Everybody pitches in.
The doctors carry litters.
The nurses check up on the doctors.
The nurses are great.
The nurses work very hard.
They get They don't get nearly enough credit.
The nurses are preposterous.
Ladies doing work that up until a very short time ago I would have thought was man's work.
They do it so well under every kind of circumstance bitter cold, horrendous heat literally under the gun.
They don't make nurses better anywhere.
Perhaps that's not the best way to phrase that.
Competent.
Competent.
Yes.
A woman especially, is so well, is a wonderful source of comfort and tenderness and hope.
They give back life.
Can you do better?
Probably in school, somewhere in the growing-up process you've read a lot of Hemingway and his reports from Madrid in the Spanish War.
He romanticized that war.
I think you might agree.
Do you agree now with romanticizing war?
You know I used to love reading Hemingway 'cause he wrote so well.
But now that I'm here, I can't understand why anybody would willingly go to a war would go with enthusiasm would want to be there while it's happening.
I'd do anything to get out of here.
It's crazy.
- What about your colleagues?
- I only went as far as high school, sir.
Do you have any heroes over here, anyone you look up to?
Oh, you mean the doctors.
The doctors are really terrific.
Heck, the doctors are the whole ball game here.
I guess I'm my only hero, but I'm too cowardly to admit it.
Nah, I don't I don't think I have any heroes.
My great hero would be Abraham Lincoln, I think.
I think in so many ways he was the most interesting American that ever lived.
He would have been a great doctor.
Such a gentle man, had such compassion, such humor and yet there was a terrific toughness about him.
He was a real fighter right up to the very end.
He was of the common people, and he never lost that.
A man like Harry Truman is that kind of man decent and earthy, forthright, honest, not a buck-passer.
Men like Lincoln and Truman if they had an assignment, by God, they did it!
They didn't assume people are inclined to do, these days sort of weasel a decision.
They looked at the problem, acted and took the responsibility for it.
What do you think of President Eisenhower?
Well, he's a general.
Do you ever get leave?
Of my senses.
The other kind you don't get too much.
You take it wherever you can get it, you know?
Once I went to Tokyo.
I won a contest.
- You have fun?
- Yeah, I had a lot of fun.
- What did you do?
- I don't remember.
I guess I got a little drunk.
You said something You said there's a lot of drinking around here.
Is there a lot of drinking here?
- Did I say that?
- Yeah, you said that.
"A lot" is a relative term.
We do considerable drinking as opposed to sitting at home.
We do not enough drinking as opposed to being here.
What do you think will happen when the U.S. Leaves?
I don't know.
If I knew all the answers, I'd run for God.
Do you get to meet the South Koreans?
Do you know them?
Yeah, they're n they're nice people.
I worry about 'em though.
We got a girl here that was you know, pregnant.
She doesn't have any money or anything.
I don't know how these kids live.
I mean, some of'em don't.
That's the God's honest truth.
Some of'em don't even live over here.
- Do you help them?
- We do the best we can but we haven't got I mean, we got just Sometimes we got just enough for ourself.
Penicillin and stuff like that.
I mean, I really wish somebody would tell these people back home this.
When you have to look these kids in the face, that's where it's really at.
I mean, that's what the ball game really is is looking these kids in the face here.
Can you tell me what you miss most?
- Oh, you mean, back home-wise?
- Yes.
Well, my family of course my wife, my children.
They're my strength.
I'm one of those that feels that marriage is the headstone of American society.
Pistachio ice cream and bananas.
And pancakes.
I miss And, uh, bacon frying.
The smell of bacon in the morning, waking up to that.
It's a long time since I smelled that.
I miss my wife, of course miss my son, daughter-in-law.
I have a new baby grandchild.
I haven't seen her.
I'd like to.
One of the things I miss the most is people my own age for companionship.
I'm old enough to be the father of almost everyone around here, and then some.
You just miss being able to sit around and chew the fat with somebody your own age somebody with your own background well, not background, but your own experiences.
-  - What about you, Doctor, when the war is over?
I've got a lot of lost time to make up to my family.
- Where is home?
- The Bay Area, San Francisco.
Specifically Mill Valley, is where I live.
That's where Peg is, and my daughter Erin.
She's lovely.
She squeezes your nose.
Well, first thing I want to do is see my mom.
Then I got this '41 Chevy that I'm fixin' up.
A neighbor swapped me it for one of our pregnant sows.
It sounds like you come from farm country.
Yes, sir!
Iowa.
Ottumwa, Iowa.
Nobody famous ever come from there except once, Eleanor Roosevelt's car got stalled at our train crossing.
Some people heard the screaming, and they said, "That sounds just like Eleanor Roosevelt"!
Well, there's my practice, of course.
I might just write a book about my experiences here.
Possibly go into politics.
Would you give up medicine?
Some people think I could be more useful if I did.
After the war what, Father?
Oh I, uh I'd like to be warm and clean and hear confessions and maybe run the C.Y.O. I'd like to take six to seven months and become unconscious.
Just sleep not do anything, not go anyplace not have anything asked of me.
Then I'd like to go to Europe and sleep there for a year.
You want to say hello to anybody back home?
You're kid You mean on camera, on TV I can say hello?
Hey, hey!
You're kidding me.
I can really say hello on camera?
Yeah, I'd like to say hello to my wife, LaVerne.
Won't be long now, honey, I'll be home.
My mom and my dad, Butch That's his nickname, Butch and my sister, Yvonne, and, uh and all the guys there at Leo's Grill and J And J's Sweet Shop.
Hey, hey, guys!
I had to come over here to be a star.
Would you like to say hello to your family?
Oh, well, yes.
Hello.
Hello, darling.
Hi, sweetheart.
I love you.
We haven't got a TV.
The nearest one is over at Grange Hall in, uh, Mooseville.
It's about 50 miles.
'Bout two-hour drive in the Chevy or an hour by foot.
I'm sure your folks would make the trip to see you.
Hi, Mom and Uncle Ed.
- Is this too personal?
- No.
It's Walter.
Um, I really miss you and I love you.
Anyone at home you'd like to say hello to, to send a message?
- They'll see it.
- Well, there is but I just don't think that's dignified, so I won't do it.
Oh, I don't have to say hello.
I know how everybody feels about me.
Yes, I'd like to say hello to Harry Truman and I'd like to know why Bess hasn't written me back.
You actually wrote her?
Yes, I wrote her a very heartfelt letter.
Maybe she's too touched to respond yet, huh?
No, I think she doesn't like me.
That's the only conclusion I can draw.
I was very specific about what I liked about her.
I even suggested things.
She hasn't written back.
You'd think I'd have at least heard from Harry.
Could have at least called me a son of a .
He's done it for others.
These men and women with whom you work, you want to see them after the war?
I'm torn between the idea of the love I have for these people and wanting that relationship to continue and wanting to erase all the memories I have of this place.
Colonel, you've spoken of the father figure.
Do you think that after the war you'll want to maintain a friendship or a connection with these young men and women after this is over?
- Absolutely.
- Do you think you will?
I'm not sure about that but I hope I will, and I hope they will with me.
'Cause I'm  Excuse me.
Very, very close to some of these young men and very honored to be associated with them.
-  - Three hours ago the enemy, which prefers to attack at dawn did just that about 18 miles north of here.
- The wounded have been arriving ever since.
- Heads up.
!
Comin' in!
Now the people of this MASH are doing the work that they do best but that they would rather not be doing at all in a place they'd rather not be.
A war is like when it rains in New York and everybody crowds into doorways.
They all get chummy together perfect strangers.
The only difference, of course, is in a war it's also raining on the other side of the street and the people who are chummy over there are trying to kill the people here who are chums.
These guys aren't soldiers.
They're doctors.
I'm a temporarily misassigned civilian.
They give back life.
Can you do better?
I mean, I really wish somebody would tell these people back home this.
I just pray that somehow it will all seem to make sense.
It's crazy.
