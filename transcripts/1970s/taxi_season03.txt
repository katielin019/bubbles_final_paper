{START OF EPISODE 1}
Saturday night is just fine.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Guys!
Doug Johnson from the art gallery just asked me out for this Saturday night!
Oh, that's very nice.
That's wonderful.
That's terrific.
Yes, and I don't have a baby-sitter, so could?
Uh, uh, uh, Bobby, do you think?
Uh, Elaine, I-I already have plans.
I'm sorry.
Oh, well, um, Tony I'd like to, Elaine, but I got a fight Saturday night.
Bobby, just this once?
Come on.
Look, I have a date Saturday night, Elaine, with a great girl.
Oh, but I-I've been dropping hints for months now for Doug to ask me out.
Hey, you know, this may be hard for you to believe, but other people have relationships that are important to them, too.
And-and this girl I'm going out with Saturday night is every bit as important to me as Doug is to you.
What's her name?
What time do you want me there?
Rieger, come in here.
Rieger!
Come in here!
Rieger!
: Come in here!
Wait a minute!
Stay right where you are!
I'll come down there!
Alex?
I got problems with my love life.
Get away from me.
Things aren't right between Zena and me.
That's right, the girl you like.
So now you got to listen to me.
I could have got you to come in the cage if I'd have said her name, yeah.
I don't understand it.
I mean, it's like somehow we got out of sync.
Our gears aren't meshing as often as they used to, if you know what I mean.
Rieger, I'm pouring my guts out to you.
You're not pouring your guts out to me.
You're telling me that you're not getting enough action.
Insatiable lust doesn't make you sympathetic.
Why not?
All right, all right.
I'll tell you the real reason.
The real thing Yeah?
What?
Go ahead.
What?
What?
Say it.
I Say it.
Say it.
Say it!
Say it!
I Say it!
Say it!
I'm afraid of losing her.
Ohh.
Alex Zena sees something in me that no other woman ever saw-- that no other person ever saw-- that isn't there.
All right, all right, do you want to keep Zena?
You're going to have to treat her better.
What makes you think I don't treat her good now?
Well, describe a typical evening with Zena.
We watch a little TV and then hit the sheets.
Well, some people call that corny, but that's the way we are.
All right, all right.
Describe a typical good evening to you experienced, romantic types.
All right, you go out to dinner maybe you take in a movie, you go home, and you talk.
Dinner, talk Yeah?
Well, well, well?
You don't want to know what you talk about?
Yeah.
I mean, give me an example.
Sports, people you have in common.
You talk.
Sports people in common You mean, like, uh, if the house looks clean I could say, "Hey, the place looks great".
Sure.
That was my idea.
I thought of the words.
You just said, "talk".
I got the golden key here.
Look out, world.
Dinner, movies sports Gee, the place looks immaculate.
You're going to get it.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about your attitude.
Trying to romance you is like trying to blow your nose without a handkerchief.
That's disgusting.
I can't do nothing right tonight.
for a French meal you don't want to eat, they don't want me to take home.
I got to go out and find my own bags at 8:00 at night.
I don't know what the hell this is.
You order something with eyes?
No.
Me, neither.
Look, Louie, I'd like to get to sleep early tonight, so if you don't mind No, no, no.
I don't mind.
Louie.
Louie!
What, what?
I'll brush my teeth in the morning.
I want you to leave here.
I want you to leave my apartment.
I want you to leave me alone.
Boy, this place looks immaculate.
Louie, I don't want to be ignored.
I need to be alone.
I'm very tense tonight.
I know what'll take the tension out of you.
Oh, no.
No.
: Zena, you seem a little distant tonight.
What did I do so bad?
Send me to jail.
I think you're beautiful.
You arouse me.
Officer, take me away.
I want you to leave.
All right.
Okay, I'm leaving.
Listen how about one little glass of apricot brandy, just for the trail home?
I don't have any apricot brandy.
Louie does.
Louie, don't you even want to know what's bothering me?
Well, whatever it is, it couldn't be that bad.
I mean, you still love me, don't you?
Please let me be deaf.
Louie I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
But I met another man.
Louie, I didn't want to bring it up, because see, I was just hoping it would kind of sort itself out.
I'm a little bit confused.
You see two weeks ago a girlfriend and I went to Mario's for a drink after work, and I met this guy, Dwight.
He's the day bartender there.
At Mario's?
Mario's.
He asked me to go out with him.
And normally I would have said no, and I did think of you, but he was so nice, and right away there was something good between us.
I'm sure you don't want to know the details.
No, you don't, really.
We had lunch together.
We had several lunches.
Then one evening we had dinner.
Then we had more dinners.
I don't know what happened, but I kept on seeing him, but we weren't physical.
We were just friends, and it was really great.
And then, one day, without my seeing it coming or anybody planning it, we became lovers.
It came out of our friendship-- out of the fact that we enjoyed each other's company.
I don't know, maybe if I'd seen it coming I could have done something to stop it, but I didn't see it coming.
What's wrong?
"I can't breathe"!
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
What?
Oh, drink!
Okay.
Here.
So what are you saying, Zena?
I mean, I'm missing something.
What are you saying?
I think it would be best if we didn't see each other for a while Uh, okay.
I see you got your mind made up about this.
If that's the way you want it, that's the way it will be.
Let me just I'll get dressed and I'll leave you alone.
One for the road.
You know something, Zena?
Someday you're going to come back to me-- crawling on your knees, begging me to take you back-- and when you do you know what I'll say?
I'll say thank God.
Have a beer, please?
Hey, now, look, Elaine, you tripped me up on this date thing Saturday night.
Now, I know I agreed to baby-sit your kids, but I've reconsidered.
I've always been bad with names, and it's really important to me, and her name is Gloria.
Gloria who?
You said 8:00, right?
Elaine?
Would you care to dance?
Jim, um, there's not any music.
There will be soon.
I put a quarter in the jukebox.
No.
You just put a quarter in the cigarette machine.
Well, Elaine, would you care to smoke?
I hate to do this, but I got to get out of here.
Got to get up early in the morning.
What for?
I'm meeting you guys here for breakfast.
Mm.
Ah.
Right.
We all better get going.
Thanks, yeah.
Hey, wait a minute.
They haven't played my cigarette yet.
Jim, let's go.
Let's go, Jim.
Hey, Louie.
You look awful.
What is that smell?
Apricots?
I'm shattered.
It's terrible.
My life is over.
Oh.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
See you, Louie.
Hey, Lou?
Come on.
Sit down.
All right.
Hey, Lou what's wrong?
Zena left me.
Oh, no.
I was up all night, drinking.
The worst part about it is I kept Ma up all night too.
Why was that?
What do you want me to do?
Talk to the walls?
Rieger, did you ever have your guts ripped out by some woman?
Louie, I know exactly how you feel.
I mean, just four years ago I was going with this girl What am I supposed to do, here?
My life is falling apart so I should listen to stories about you?
I mean, you know, let's put the little selfishness in check here.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I ain't even told you the worst part.
Zena told me that she she said she fell for a a bartender who works here at Mario's, named Dwight.
And I think that's him over there.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
He doesn't look like a Dwight.
Well, I know there's one way to find out.
Look out, Dwight!
I think it's him.
What was that all about?
Forget it.
Forget it.
It's a false alarm.
I'm going to go talk to him.
No, no, no, no!
Rieger, Rieger, Rieger, I'm only going to go buy us a couple of beers.
No, no, no, no!
I'll buy the beers.
You sit.
You sit.
All right.
Uh, fine, but while you're over there pump the scum for information.
No pumping.
Pump him!
No pumping.
Pump the scum!
Just beer!
Pump the scum!
No!
Just beer!
Pump him!
Pump the scum No, Louie, I'm not going to be a spy for you.
Now, sit.

Stay : Pump him.
Two beers, please.
What?
Uh, two beers, please.
Yeah.
So how are you doing?
Huh?
Fine.
How are you?
Well I'm great now.
But I'll tell ya, if you'd asked me yesterday, I would have been in trouble.
But, uh, I think I finally got it figured out.
I met this new girl in here a few weeks ago named Zena Sherman.
She came in one day.
I was working the day shift.
Uh, we hit it off real well right away, you know?
Next thing I know, we're seeing each other almost every day.
Things are getting better and better all the time.
All of a sudden, she starts getting serious on me.
I mean, I don't have to tell you that, uh, that takes all the fun out of it, you know?
So, I mean, I decided, hey, I'm just going to stop seeing her, you know?
Oh, uh, thank you.
Thank you.
What did he say?
Uh Did you find out anything?
No, nothing much.
He didn't get around to telling me his dog tag numbers.
Tell me.
Tell me.
Uh, all right.
Uh, it is Dwight.
No, no, no!
Scum!
They been going with each other for a couple of weeks.
She's serious.
He's not.
He's going to break it off with her.
I don't believe it.
Yeah.
He's going to dump her?
Right.
He's going to break Zena's heart.
That's good for me.
But it's terrible for her.
I can't help but have mixed feelings about this.
I'm torn between joy and rapture.
I'm sorry, Zena.
I just thought I'd tell you how I feel.
Hi.
Sorry it couldn't work out.
Okay, okay.
Nobody's blaming you.
Hi, Zena.
Louie.
Okay, okay.
So you got hurt.
We all get hurt.
Everybody gets theirs.
I got mine.
You got yours.
Everybody gets everybody else's here.
Everybody destroys, and everybody destroys everybody else.
It's what separates us from the animals.
I think we can resume on our old footing.
I was going to make you beg, but I can't now.
Maybe a teeny bit.
Louie, I don't want you back.
You're going to have to do a little better than that.
I'm serious.
What are you talking about?
No, Louie, I really don't.
We're through.
Look I didn't stop seeing you only 'cause of Dwight.
Most of the reasons I stopped seeing ya have only to do with you.
I suppose that's my fault.
Louie you have an attitude problem.
You've got a personality problem.
You got a sensitivity problem.
You got a selfishness problem.
You got an emotional problem.
You got a maturity problem.
You got a sexual problem.
What do you mean?
It's all you ever think about.
You mean, that's the problem?
Yeah.
Zena Look There is no way I am going back with you.
Zena, don't you love me?
I don't know what love is.
Well, you're in luck, 'cause I do.
And you know something, Zena?
You couldn't hear this from anybody else, because I think that I'm the only person alive who knows what love is.
Because I read what everybody else says it is, and I never see the right answer.
Okay.
All right.
You don't want to know what love is?
All right.
You won't know what love is.
I'll know what love is.
This is your last chance to know what love is.
Okay.
What is it?
Love is the end of happiness.
Because one day, all a guy's got to do to be happy is to watch the Mets.
The next day, you got to have Zena in the room watching the Mets with you.
You don't know why.
They're still the Mets, it's the same room, but you got to have Zena there.
Ugh!
You really feel that way, Louie?
Yes.
You can't watch the Mets without me?
Nope.
Well, I can't watch them now, anyway, because it's the middle of the winter.
But the philosophy's the same.
You want to see me again, Zena?
Oh, God.
Here I am, back in the same old stinking, lousy, crummy, rotten relationship all over again-- the same place I was in to begin with.
I'll never get out from under it.
Oh, Zena, you don't know how happy that makes me feel.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Hey.
Here, get the air moving around me in here a little bit.
You want me to fan you?
I don't think so, Louie.
You see, I left my palm leaf back at the hut this morning.
Go ahead.
Make it racial right away.
Oh, guys.
Hi, Elaine.
Now, you know that I'm not the kind of mother who comes in with boring stories about her kids, right?
Yes, we've noticed that about you, Elaine, yes.
And I can't tell you how much we appreciate it.
That's the one thing I like most about you, Elaine, you know that?
Yeah.
Thanks a lot for not doing that, Elaine.
Oh, I forgot.
We're only allowed to talk about hangovers and the Jets.
Hey, did you see the Jet game this weekend?
No.
I was hung over.
Latka, do you like kid stories?
Oh, yes, I love them.
You know, when I was five and a half and I was just so high and I was so cute, you could eat me up alive.
Uh, you know, I had these big cheeks then, you know And Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're telling me a kid story about yourself?
Yes, because you know, I am a bachelor.
I am the only kid I've got.
Hey, Lou.
Hey, Ton.
Hey, Bobby.
Whatcha say?
Hey, did your sister get moved in?
Yeah.
She's coming down here pretty soon.
Yeah, I can't wait to meet her.
Oh, uh, Bobby, I'd rather you wouldn't.
Why not?
Well, I mean, if you had a sister you wouldn't want a guy like you to meet her, would ya?
Oh, yeah, I'll hang around the back till she leaves.
Hey, Alex, I talk to you?
Yeah, sure.
What?
Remember when I read you my sister's letters and you said if she wasn't married and from Spokane you might want to go out with her?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, you're in luck.
She's divorced, she's moved in, and she's free for lunch.
Uh, uh Tony, Tony, look, I don't think it's a great idea for someone to date a friend's sister, you know?
Especially an Italian boxer friend's sister, if you know what I mean.
Alex, I know what you're afraid of.
But don't worry about it.
I mean, Monica's all grown up.
She's been married and everything.
I doubt she's even a virgin anymore.
So Yeah.
I want you to know I thought about it and it's okay with me if you want to go to bed with Monica.
Uh, Tony I better warn you, this might lead to dinner.
Listen, Alex, I'm only saying this because I know you're a good guy.
You'd call her the next day stay friends, stuff like that, right?
I'm beginning to get a crush on myself here.
Well Eh, Tony, excuse me, but could I please have a crack at your sister, too?
Don't be ridiculous, Latka.
Why?
I would call her the next day and stay friends with her and all that, too.
Listen, who are you fooling?
I would marry the wench.
Could you come upstairs for a second, Alex?
Mm-hmm.
So I could talk to you?
There's no privacy down here.
Boy, what-what does Alex have that I don't have?
A big nose and a Green Card.
Excuse me.
Uh, could you help me?
I'm afraid all I give is rubdowns.
I just wanted you to tell me where my brother is.
Who's your brother?
Tony Banta.
Huh.
I don't allow no family get-togethers in my garage.
Well, I just want to talk to him for two minutes.
Give me a buck.
You must be Louie.
How do you know who I am?
'Cause I only had three people described to me.
One was good-looking, one was smart, and one was you.
Well, meow.
Oh, I'm in luck-- a human being.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Uh, could you tell Tony Banta that his sister's here?
Oh, you are Tony's sister?
Yeah.
Well, do you know that you and I are forbidden to love?
It's a shame, it's a big shame.
Because we would have made beautiful babies together.
I never thought I'd say this, but don't go away.
Next.
Did I hear someone say you were from Spokane?
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, I lived there for five years.
Were you ever there?
No, no Uh, wait a minute.
I was born there.
Uh  I'm, uh Jim Ignatowski.
Uh, Monica Douglas.
Did, uh, you buy that dress in Spokane?
Uh yeah, I did.
It's been a long time since I've seen a dress from Spokane.
Smooth, Iggy.
Real smooth.
Excuse me.
Iggy.
She went thataway.
Much obliged.
What did you do in, uh, Spokane?
I, uh, played the flute in the symphony there.
Really?
Yeah.
I wouldn't kid you.
The flute is my favorite instrument.
Yeah?
Except for the gong.
Yeah?
You mean the gonnnnng?
Yeah.
You know it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I like it, too.
I bet you play great.
Well Vivaldi is my favorite.
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.
Uh : * Dum, dum, dah dah dah * * Dum * Duhh Yeah.
* Duhh * Da-da-da-da, da da-da-dum * * Duh-duh-duh-duh * Dum, dum * Dum dum dum da, da, da * * Dum dum dum da, da, da * Dum dum dum da-da-dum-dum * * Dum-dum * Dah!
* Dum-dum, da-da-dum dum-dum-dum * * Dum-dum * Dum-dum, da-da-dum dum-dum-dum * * Dum-da-da, dum-da-da *  Excuse me.
Your attention, everybody.
I didn't think it would be necessary for me to make this rule, but no Vivaldi in the garage.
Thank you.
One of these days I got to get it together and go to the symphony.
I'm pretty sure New York has one.
New York has a great symphony.
Ah?
I'd like to go, too.
Well, uh see if you think you're going to go, maybe, uh maybe I could sort of tag along.
Well, you don't have to tag along.
Maybe we could go together.
Huh I just got a rush.
Yo, Monica!
Tony!
Tony!
Oh.
Hey, everybody, my sister, Monica.
Hi, there.
Family pride.
Hey, and this here's Alex Rieger.
Ah And he's got something to say to you.
Oh?
Hi.
Yeah.
Uh Oh, yeah, let me just say, first that I can't take you to lunch 'cause something came up.
Oh, really?
That's too bad.
Well, it's a shame, but it's okay, because Alex here has got something he wants to say to ya.
Oh, yeah?
I was just going to a-as He would like to know if you would like to go to lunch with him today, right, Alex?
You were?
Sure, he was.
Well, I-I You really want to go to lunch with me, or are you just asking me because my brother asked you to ask me?
Huh?
No, no.
I was  Uh, Monica, come on, I mean, that's insulting to Alex.
He's asking you 'cause he wants to ask you.
Okay, okay, okay, great.
Let's go to lunch.
Well, are-are you sure you want to do this, Monica?
I mean Well, uh She's sure.
She's sure.
Uh-huh?
Why is everybody checking everything?
Okay, okay.
Let's go.
Sure.
Have a good time.
: Okay.
Okay.
Why you all over me for?
Uh, am I here?
I'm sorry.
Yeah?
So, not a bad sublet, huh?
Hey, how much you paying?
$500.
How many bedrooms?
No bedrooms.
It's a studio.
Air conditioned?
No.
They include utilities?
Uh-uh.
So what do you think?
You sign the lease already?
Yeah.
I love it.
So, uh, how did it go with Alex?
Fine.
Hey.
Ooh, you still got that great arm.
So, uh, tell me about your date.
Bet he took you someplace classy, just like Alex would.
Oh, we went to a little hamburger place.
Just like Alex.
He never puts on airs.
So, uh, what did you guys talk about?
Well, actually, we didn't talk all that much.
In fact, at one point Alex said, "I can't get a pause in edgewise".
Ah.
Ah!
What an icebreaker.
So, so when are you guys going to see each other again?
I don't know.
I mean, he's a nice guy and everything, but he's not my type, you know?
Your husband was your type.
Tony, don't start.
An Electrolux salesman with every allergy in the book who painted turtles for relaxation.
You know, you always make so much of that one time he painted the turtle.
Hey, Monica, listen.
Come here.
You've been divorced about a year and you moved back into town.
You and I, we got a chance to start off fresh.
Yeah.
So let's start.
Man, you're my sister and I love you.
Okay.
And you're my brother and I love you.
Now you're going to say something that's going to drive me crazy, right?
We all got our faults.
I'm messy around the house.
You fall for garbage.
Trust me enough to try to get interested in Alex.
No, no, not Alex.
But I tell ya, there was one guy in the garage who I thought was really sweet.
Alex is the sweetest.
No.
I'm talking about Jim Ignatowski.
Monica.
Monica!
Not him.
The man's Silly Putty.
The last girl Jim went out with lived in a forest and ate bark.
Trust me to know you're attracted to losers.
And Alex ain't no loser, and I set it up.
And he likes you.
And hey, listen, let me tell you, I was worried about that, because he don't like just anybody.
Oh, yeah?
Hello?
Oh, hi.
Yeah, we were just talking about you.
Yeah, yeah.
I'd love to.
Oh, it doesn't make any difference.
We could eat before or after the symphony.
I'm going to straighten your life out if it kills me.
Oh, well, listen, if it's a problem for you, you know, we could go Dutch.
No, it doesn't have anything to do with wooden shoes.
Ignatowski!
Excuse me.
If a, uh, Mr. Ignatowski shows up looking for me, could you please give him this note?
Very good, Mademoiselle.
Thank you.
Oh, there he is.
I believe this is for you, sir.
Is this the bill already?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's-it's from the lady.
"Couldn't wait any longer.
Sorry I missed you.
Monica".
Uh I'm sorry, too.
Guess I'll see you some other time.
Where are you going?
We can't have dinner together.
Why not?
I don't know.
You didn't go into it.
No.
I, uh, see, I wrote this note when I thought that you weren't coming here.
Ah But, uh it's, uh it's-it's okay.
Uh can we take our table back?
Sit down, Mademoiselle.
Thank you very much.
Right here.
Oh, thank you very much.
So why were you late?
Well,  I, uh, got a note from Tony to wait until he brought his cab back in.
I never got so much mail in my life.
I can't believe it.
I-I what did he say?
He was pretty emotional about us not seeing each other after tonight.
I told him not to worry.
It's not like we're starting a big romance.
Would you like to order a drink before dinner?
Uh, bring us your best Chablis.
A glass or a bottle?
I don't want a glass.
How about you?
Please.
Please.
Uh, slow us down a little, but so what?
Ooh.
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to shave.
That's all right.
My face grows hair very fast.
I shave, and it seems like only a matter of days before it's back.
It's been a long time since I've had to be interesting.
Well, you're doing fine.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Well, you know I don't have much hair on my body at all.
I mean, uh compared to my face my skin is like a smooth baby pumpkin.
Uh I didn't mean to talk erotic.
Would you like to order now?
Uh Can I take the liberty of of ordering for us?
Okay.
Uh nous voudrions la foie gras de canard en terrine.
Et, encore le civet de lapin pour deux personnes.
Du lapin.
Excellent, Monsieur.
Excellent.
Merci beaucoup.
Boy, you speak French.
No.
Huh No, I just learned what I should order.
Took me all day.
You mean, you did that for me?
That was the easy part.
The hard part was phoning all over town trying to find a restaurant that serves that.
Boy.
Boy, what a guy.
Come on.
No, no, what a guy.
Oh.
You're turning my head.
Oh.
Could I, uh see you again soon?
When?
Later tonight?
Okay.
Uh listen, I wasn't going to say this unless we hit it off-- you know, really liked each other.
Yeah?
Let's not tell Tony that we're going to keep on seeing each other, okay?
You really like me that much?
More.
Don't tell anyone else in the whole garage.
Wow.
Yeah.
I got to tell you something.
You make me happy.
I mean, even after I first met you and I was alone in my apartment lining the shelves, I'd think of you and I'd smile.
Oh When I think of me, I smile, too.
We're both thinking of me.
Hey, Jim.
What?
Huh?
Hey, listen, uh, something's been bothering me the last couple of weeks.
I probably should have said something sooner, but Hey, I'm real sorry I had to stop you from seeing Monica.
Oh, that's okay.
Nah.
Listen, it's nothing personal but sometimes you just got to do what your head tells you.
So look, I don't blame you for being sore.
You got every right, so if you want to, you plant one right here, go ahead.
Go on, don't worry about it.
Plant one right there, go ahead.
Thanks, Tony.
I do feel a little better.
Now if you'll excuse me, I got to go see Monica.
Oops.
Ah, Tony, Tony, now, look, now look, now, I-I-I know it's none of my business, but I don't think you should interfere.
Now come on, let's go to Mario's and have a beer.
Come on, I'll buy, all right?
No, no, no.
I ain't going to Mario's.
All you want to do is talk some sense into me.
I'm going over to my sister's while I still got a full head of steam.
All right, all right, okay, okay, keep your full head.
But let me make one point here.
Now it's very clear to an outside observer that Monica doesn't have a problem.
Jim doesn't have a problem.
You're the one with the problem.
Oh, yeah, Alex?
Yeah.
Let me tell you something.
I blame you for this whole thing.
What do you mean you blame me?
If you had more on the ball, she'd have gone for you.
What are you talking about?
Huh, I know what you did.
You tried some of that dry humor on her-- the stuff that nobody laughs, they just say, "ooh, clever".
Yeah Tony, Tony To we're crossing a line we don't want to cross here.
Remember, we're friends.
Friends, Alex?
We're friends?
You don't think enough of me to go to bed with my sister.
Best time of my life.
I knocked, but I guess you couldn't hear.
All right, Jim, hit the road.
I told you to stop seeing my sister.
Now, I want you to l Just wait a minute here.
You can't come in here and tell a guest of mine in my house to leave.
Yeah?
Well, I ain't leaving till he leaves.
Okay, Tony, but you better make yourself comfortable because I sleep over.
Good, Jim.
Good.
Of course, we have a lot of room here.
We'll need a bathroom schedule.
You're out, buddy!
You're out.
Tony, w-what are you doing?
Put him down!
It's Chicago '68 all over again.
I can't stand it anymore, Monica.
That's no reason to start acting like a tough guy.
Look at him, Monica.
He's a burnt-out loser.
You know that for a fact?
Come on, you don't even know what Washington D.C. stands for.
District of Columbia.
See?
Oh, Tony.
Come on, I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for you two guys.
You told me one thing and you did something else.
Aw Monica, I get it ain't right, Monica!
Tony I'm tired of this, Monica.
I can't take it.
Can I have a private word with you?
Tony, do you know how ridiculous you look right now?
Doesn't he look ridiculous, Monica?
Absolutely.
Not only are you making a fool of yourself but your arms are starting to get tired, right?
Huh?
You know, you've been doing this your whole life, Tony-- getting yourself into tight spots then finding out you were wrong when it was too late to know what to do.
So what are you going to do now, huh?
I don't know.
Do you know, Jim?
Hey, he got himself into this mess.
Let him get himself out of it.
Hey, you all right?
Well,  my shorts are riding a little high.
Otherwise You know, Tony, I knew someone like you once.
Is that all you're going to say, Jim?
I think I made my point.
You understood that, right?
Yeah.
You two on anything?
Yeah, Tony.
We're on threads of hope, trying to weave us a basket.
I suppose you got that one, too, huh?
No, I bat about .
500.
That's all right, honey.
I don't get 'em all, either.
Alex says everyone's making sense but me.
I'm sorry I busted in.
Wow.
Listen to that.
He never does that.
He never apologized.
Well, we're really maturing here, aren't we?
Huh?
Huh?
I really am sorry.
He did it again.
Well, you get to stay for dinner for that one.
I'm really sorry, Jim.
Isn't this wonderful?
What have we all learned from this?
Tony's learned he can't pick who his sister is going to fall for.
Monica's learned she can't pick who she's going to fall for.
And I think I've learned the most important thing of all: I love being lifted.
*   Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
You know, Bobby, I been thinking about something.
Yeah?
Look at me-- I get up every morning, I eat breakfast, I get dressed, I go to the gym and I come to work.
I go home, I watch TV, and I go to sleep.
Next day, I wake up, I start the whole thing all over again.
Yeah, I think about my life that way sometimes too, Tony.
It's depressing, isn't it?
Depressing?
!
I was thinking I had it made.
Hey, good evening, everybody.
Hey, Alex.
Yo, Alex.
Hey, Louie got our cabs ready yet?
No.
Not yet.
Hey, Rieger, how's your daughter?
My daughter?
I don't know, I guess she's fine.
Haven't heard from her for awhile.
Hey, wait a minute.
How come you're asking me a normal human question?
I don't know.
I just thought I'd try it.
Oh.
You can ask me a normal human question once in a while too, you know.
It's a two-way street.
All right.
You still have that cockroach problem, Louie?
Yeah.
Hm.
Thanks for asking.
There!
Would you believe that?
There's one of the little buggers now.
Don't fight back.
Looked like you, Iggy.
Thanks, boss.
Now, back to your daughter.
How old was she when your wife pulled out with her?
Hey, Louie, I wouldn't discuss the weather with you.
What makes you think I would discuss the personal facts of my life?
Listen, go easy on me here.
Would you just get away from me?
I'm trying to do this gentle.
I know something that would break your heart.
Oh, yeah?
What do you know?
All right, let's proceed my way and No, no, just tell me what you know.
Just tell me what you know.
Let's do it my way.
My way or no way.
You just tell me My way or no way!
All right, your way.
All right.
Your daughter what are you listening to, Banta?
I could be here if I want to, Louie.
No, you can't.
This is America, Louie.
No, it isn't!
It isn't?
No!
This garage is Louie Land.
You want to go to America?
Go outside.
I'll be over here if you need me, Alex.
Yeah, so?
So how old was your daughter when your wife pulled out?
All right, she was two.
Two.
Hey, what are you getting at?
Alex, he doesn't know anything.
What are you letting him do this to you for?
No, no, no, I think he knows something.
His eyes are bulging like a frog's in heat.
Rieger, you're smart to notice this.
Stick around, Nardo.
He's going to need your ample bosom to cry on in a second.
Rieger your daughter's gettin' married and the wedding is here in New York City, and she didn't even invite the man whose glands gave her birth.
Take care of him, honey.
Wait a minute.
How do you know that?
Here.
Read it for yourself.
Right under the roach.
All right.
Her boyfriend's father is a UN ambassador.
I see it.
You raise a kid, you give them two of the best years of your life, and they wind up forgetting you.
That's why I hate kids.
It's like Ma always said: "You're better off raising tomatoes.
You can eat 'em".
All right, all right, come on, come on, leave him alone.
He'll work it out somehow.
Come on!
Let's get some cabs on the road.
Banta?
Nardo, Nardo!
Wheeler!
Come on.
Rieger, you snapped out of it yet?
Come on, it's not like it's money.
Come on.
Louie, will you knock it off?
Huh?
Give the guy some room.
You okay, Alex?
All right, will you stop making such a big deal about this, huh?
Go on, go to work.
Go to work.
Will you go to work?
Come on, no kidding.
You heard the man.
Look, I she lives in Brazil.
I saw her that one time in the past few years.
All right, so she doesn't want me at the wedding.
Big deal.
Oh, now, don't assume she doesn't want you.
I mean, it could've been some foul-up in the mail.
Oh, please, Elaine.
Rio De Janeiro to here-- do you know how far that is?
REVEREND  Six thousand eight hundred and forty-two miles.
Well do you know what kind of mail system they must have?
The Brazilian mail system is government-run with an annual budget of 27,485,000 pesetas.
How do you know these things?
You mean I'm right?
I wasn't even sure if pesetas was the right money.
Look, before you get upset, why don't you just get on the phone and call her?
Call her?
!
Yeah.
Call Brazil?
!
Yeah!
You know how much it costs to call Brazil?
You just went to the well once too often.
Alex, please call her.
Call her.
No Look, all right.
All right, all right, all right.
You're probably right.
You're probably right.
I'll call her tonight.
No, no, no!
Not tonight!
Call her right now.
What are you talking about?
I Call her, Alex.
Go ahead.
Go on.
All right, I'll call her now.
Good.
It's in this paper, too.
"After honeymooning in the Orient, "the newlyweds will return home to their estate in Majorca-- a gift to them from the bride's father".
Wow!
Nice present, Alex.
Tony, I think they meant Cathy's other father.
Hello.
Hello.
Can I speak to Cathy Consuelos, please?
Well, then, can I speak to her mother?
No, no, no, please don't put me on hold.
Look, I'm calling from New York City on a middle-class income.
I-I-I assume you're Mrs. Consuelos' secretary?
Right, good.
Listen, I'm Alex Rieger.
I'm Cathy's natural father and I haven't received my my invitations yet.
All right, all right, all right, check, check, check-- go ahead-- but please check fast, will you?
Check, check, check, check Yes, hello, yes.
What right.
The natural father speaking here, yes.
What?
!
Who said I shouldn't be invited?
!
Now, you just listen to me!
You tell the mother of that bride-- I am not yelling.
I am not yelling!
You just tell Mrs. Consuelos I am not!
I am not!
You tell Mrs. Consuelos that she better have those invitations there because I'm showing up!
You hear me?
I think you're absolutely right in demanding to go to the wedding.
And if you're gonna take somebody, it better be me.
You?
!
Why?
Because you need me and I want to be there.
Reel her in, Rieger.
She's bitten the hook.
Reel her in!
Oh, come on, Louie.
Reel her in, Rieger!
Reel her in, Rieger!
Alex Rieger and guest.
Ah, yes, I'm sorry, sir, but your name isn't on the list.
How do you know so fast?
Because it's on the list that tells me you're not on the list.
Now wait a minute.
Do you know that my glands gave birth to the bride here?
!
Alex Hmm?
Just stop it.
What do you want?
Now, the important thing is we get in to see your daughter, right?
We're not even invited!
Let me handle it, okay?
Okay.
Excuse me.
Do you have a light?
You don't have a cigarette.
We don't need a cigarette.
Should I light it?
Of course.
Listen, miss I will personally be grateful to you if you would just look the other way for the next few minutes.
Elaine, Elaine, I don't like this.
My older brother here doesn't like it when I have that  instant chemical thing with a total stranger.
I figure it's a million-to-one shot I'll ever see you again, but I'm going to take it.
Go ahead.
You are magic.
Oh, uh, can we have a couple of glasses of champagne, please?
Yes.
Or does she have to flirt with you, too?
Let me just Thank you.
Alex, stop being a pain and enjoy yourself.
You are obviously with a wildly attractive woman.
Yeah I can't figure it out, I mean, I don't know why Phyllis is doing this to me.
I mean, it's not like her.
There's something up here.
I mean, not barring me from the wedding.
Not avoiding me.
She lives for confrontations.
Yeah, I think it's terrible, and you know, maybe we should talk about it, but you have always been so touchy about that ex-wife subject.
She'll get around to you later.
Don't worry about it.
You have always been so touchy about the ex-wife thing that I just naturally assumed your marriage broke up for the obvious reasons.
What do you mean: obvious reasons?
Well, that you were a heel who couldn't commit to a wife or child.
Humph!
No, Elaine, she walked out on me.
Some nonsense about being a failure.
Of course, that was before they accepted my application at the cab academy.
Oh, my God.
What's wrong?
I think I just saw my ex-wife.
That's Phyllis?
Yes, I think so.
It looks like she put on a couple of extra pounds here and there and everywhere.
Mmm Alex!
Hmm?
Oh, look who's oh!
Look at this!
I finally found you!
Beautiful!
You are gorgeous!
Finally, a real welcome.
What do you mean?
I have been looking all over for you.
I was afraid you didn't make it.
Are you kidding?
A team of wild ex-wives couldn't keep me away.
You look oh, excuse me.
This is Elaine.
Nardo.
Nardo.
Oh, gosh, it's such a pleasure to meet you.
You look so beautiful.
And without makeup.
I couldn't tell from where we were sitting, Oh, where were you sitting?
but the detail on the dress Oh, uh, well, we had good seats, they were just Way back.
High.
But fine.
But fine.
You were supposed to be seated on the aisle in the third row.
And I wanted you to be in the reception line with us.
Didn't you get the note with my invitation?
No, no, I'm afraid I didn't.
No.
Oh, I don't understand how a mistake like this could happen.
Well, what's the difference?
Here-- waiter?
Come on.
Huh?
I want you to meet somebody.
Well, who?
Oh, my God.
I would like you to meet my father-- Carlo Consuelos.
Father, this is my father, Alex Rieger.
It's a pleasure meeting you at last.
The pleasure is mine.
Hey, it's nice of you to say that, you know that?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
Mother, what are you doing down there?
Oh, I was just pulling up his socks, dear.
I'll introduce myself later.
Well look.
If it isn't Alex.
Hello, Phyllis.
Mother, Alex was seated way up in the balcony.
Hey, what's the difference?
We were there, right?
No, it makes a lot of difference.
I don't understand how a mistake like this could be made, do you, Mother?
Darling, why don't you go take your place in the reception line.
There are people who are just hugging and crying over another little girl in a white dress.
Go, go.
Go, go.
See you later.
That's good.
Well Alex a terribly uncomfortable moment.
What's wrong with you?
How come I wasn't invited to the wedding?
!
Alex, can't we just chat first?
I mean, we have so much to talk about.
I mean, your life has changed dramatically since I knew you.
I hear they have those electronic meters now.
Hello.
I'm Elaine Nardo.
This is a beautiful wedding.
You must be so happy.
I'm sorry, did you say something?
Yes, I said that I'm Elaine Nardo.
Yes?
And this is a beautiful wedding.
Did you say you were with him?
Uh, no, actually, I didn't, but, yes, I am with Alex.
Oh.
He and I work together at the garage.
Oh, you mean you're a cab driver?
Yes, well, I also work in an art gallery, but, yes, I am a cab driver.
Oh, of course.
There must be female cab drivers.
I mean, where else would all the little cab drivers come from?
It wasn't your fault.
How come I wasn't invited?
I didn't want you there.
Oh.
All right, look, I don't want to hold the line any longer.
I'll just, uh I'll just say congratulations and good luck and, uh, remember, you haven't lost a daughter, you've gained a ton.
Phyllis, I was just I was just joking.
Hello.
Hello.
I was just joking.
It was just a joke.
Hi.
How are you?
Phyll!
Phyll eh Alex, Huh?
what happened with Mother?
Nothing.
Nothing.
We just had a chat.
Alex, she's acting real strange and I think I figured out why.
You know, she's gained a few pounds, and she's so vain about it.
Oh, yeah.
I think she was afraid of what you might say if you saw her like this.
Oh Oh, but that's crazy.
You wouldn't say anything about her weight, would you?
No, no, no I wouldn't.
No.
Why do I feel terrible?
I was shut out of my daughter's wedding, shut out of the reception; my profession has been ridiculed to an extent approaching truth, so why do I feel guilty?
Because you hurt a woman you once loved on the most important night of her life?
No, that's not it.
Because your daughter will sense her mother's hurt and it'll spoil the one evening that's supposed to be perfect.
That's the one.
Think I better go over there.
That's a very strange thing you have a talent for, Elaine, you know that?
Excuse me, uh, may I cut in, please?
Don't let him.
May-May I cut in, please?
He looks like a bad dancer.
Phyllis, we have something to talk about.
Of course, Mr. Rieger.
You two should talk.
Thank you.
A fine gentleman.
Come on, Phyllis, let's dance.
No No Come on, Phyllis, let's dance.
No!
Everybody's watching.
Just dance with me, please.
Just dance with me.
This goes here.
Now, come on.
Aha!
You've been sneaking out and taking dancing lessons, haven't you?
What is the point of this?
I was afraid I may have hurt your feelings.
You wish you could hurt my feelings.
Look, if I hurt your feelings You didn't hurt my feelings.
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.
You're not sorry you hurt my feelings.
Then I did hurt your feelings.
Did I hurt your feelings?
Yes, you hurt my feelings.
You have no feelings.
Am I crazy, or was that fun?
No, it's not fun.
None of this is fun.
Leave me the hell alone.
Phyllis, come on, we're acting crazy.
We were once married.
Look, I just want to talk to you for five minutes alone in that room, okay?
Come on.
You get your hands off me or I'll charge you for half this wedding.
No.
Okay.
Um  Gee, just like our old apartment.
What a nice touch.
Did you plan this this way?
Phyllis, look, I made some remarks about your appearance and I didn't mean them.
I mean, look, it was I was just angry because you didn't invite me to the wedding.
But you really look terrific and I'm glad we saw each other again.
You took me all the way in here to do what you had to do as badly as you just did it?
I mean, I have Kleenex in my purse getting ready for this moment.
What was that you said?
"I was mad, and I didn't mean it"?
That's the truth.
What do you want me to say?
No, it was fine what you said.
Are we finished?
I can't tell.
You would think that after 18 years, you could stop criticizing me.
Wouldn't you?
After 18 years, you wouldn't think that you could still make me crazy.
Would you?
Come on, Phyllis.
Come on.
Okay, look, we come in here and you tell me I look terrific?
I'm 18 years older.
I'm 30 pounds heavier.
You know, I've let this dress out three times.
It's a month old.
I mean, this is all recent.
You know, I was nervous before the wedding.
I started eating.
What were you nervous about?
Having gained 27 pounds since we last saw each other.
You still have that great sense That great sense of humor.
I hate being mimicked.
I hate it!
You still do, huh?
Yes, I do, yes.
You mean the same old things still annoy you?
Yes.
Aw : Whoa-whoa!
You stop that, stop that, stop that.
Testing; just testing.
Just testing.
Yes, the same old things annoy me, yes.
What were you just thinking?
Nah, no, nothing.
No, come on, what were you thinking?
No, no, no.
I wasn't thinking about the things that annoy me.
I was thinking about, uh, some of the nice things; some of the, ah, well Why, Alex Eh?
what a dirty little mind we have.
No, no, no, no, no.
It wasn't dirty.
I was just thinking about some of the, you know, the things that, uh I know exactly what you were thinking.
Oh, yeah?
What was I thinking?
Yeah, I know exactly.
All right, what?
You were thinking I was not.
No, I know.
I got it, I got it, okay?
Oh, yeah?
What?
Come here.
What?

I mean the physical part of our relationship was always pretty fair, huh?
Good.
Good?
Great!
It was great!
Yeah, we always knew how to push each other's buttons, didn't we?
But now I don't know whether I can push anybody's buttons anymore or anybody can push my buttons.
Or find my buttons anymore.
Well, listen, if they ever get up a search party Oh, Alex you are so sweet.
Oh, Phyllis, it's really great being able to say good-bye this way, you know?
Oh, I know.
I'm so glad.
Phyllis, Phyllis Phyllis, come on.
Mm, mm No, Phyllis Oh, Phyllis, no Ooh, ow, ooh  Oh, and to think I didn't want you to be at this wedding.
Mother!
Alex!
They said you came this way!
I'm cutting the cake.
Hi, kid.
Well This is the best gift I could've received-- seeing you two together.
Yeah, well, five minutes later, you would've had a better gift.
You know what I'd really like to see?
You two hugging each other.
Oh, come on, come on, Cathy, please Oh, come on, you can do it.

{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
How's dinner, Elaine?
Hmm?
Good, huh?
Yeah, it's great.
It's great.
I really appreciate this, guys.
Don't thank us, Elaine.
Seeing you cheer up is reward enough.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I know I'm not responding much, but I just don't bounce back the way I used to.
Hey, believe me, no guy's worth getting this upset over.
No?
Elaine, you know what I think you should do?
I think you should go out with someone else right away.
That's a good idea.
I'm not talking about falling in love, or, you know, getting involved.
I mean, just go out with somebody else, but right away.
I don't know anybody else.
Well, what about a stranger?
Maybe she don't know any strangers.
Boy, you got all the answers.
Hey, everybody.
Guess what?
I got a part.
All right!
Congratulations.
This calls for a celebration.
Next round of drinks is on me.
No, no, no.
I got the part, I insist, I want to pay for my own drink.
Not a chance.
Hey, Elaine, help me go get 'em?
No, I don't Come on, come on.
The walk will do you good.
Come on, baby.
Put it there.
Hey.
Sit down, Bob.
Get a chair.
So, tell me, tell me, huh?
What's the part?
What's the part?
Well, it's in an off-Broadway play and I've been doing a lot of thinking about it.
Uh, excuse me.
Hi.
Are you two together?
Yeah, we're together.
Oh, whoa.
You mean she and I?
No, no, no, no, no.
We're just friends.
Uh, I'm Tony Banta, and this is Elaine Nardo.
Pleased to meet you.
Kirk Bradshaw.
And we're pleased to meet you, huh, Elaine?
Yeah, right.
Hi.
So, Kirk, you come here often?
Yeah, well, my office is just around the corner.
Oh, yeah, what do you do?
I'm an investment analyst.
Wow An invest an investment analyst.
Uh, small world.
Why, are you an investment analyst?
Nah, cabdriver.
Hey, Kirk, are you married?
No, Tony, I'm not.
Great.
I got some people I want you to meet.
Come on over.
Hey, guys.
This is Kirk Bradshaw.
He's an investment analyst from here in New York, and he's not married.
Why do I feel like I'm watching a game show?
Tell us what he's won, Tony.
Kirk, this is Alex, Bobby, Latka, Jim, and of course, you know Elaine.
Oh, sure, we go way back.
Sit down, Kirk.
Any friend of Elaine's is a friend of ours.
Yeah, we got a good seat for you right over here.
So, Kirk, let me tell you a little bit about Elaine.
She's a cabdriver, but she also works in an art gallery.
Really?
I'm kind of an art buff.
Ooh!
Hey, an art buff.
I'm strictly an amateur art buff, of course.
What kind of stuff you like?
Ah, just the simple stuff, I guess.
French impressionists.
French impressionists-- that's her favorite.
Oh, my God.
Ooh-la-la!
Come on, will ya?
Come on, you're embarrassing her.
No, it's okay.
It's okay.
I own a couple of pen and ink drawings by Degas.
Really!
You got the real stuff.
Oh, hey, I think Elaine would like to see those.
Oh, I'm really sorry about this.
How about tomorrow night, Elaine?
How about for dinner?
Oh, do you know what you're putting this poor man through?
How about dinner tomorrow night, Elaine?
I'd really like to, seriously.
I'm so embarrassed.
I wish you wouldn't be.
I'd love to show you my drawings.
Oh Well, uh it might be fun.
Um, why don't you call me?
Let me give you my phone number.
Here, here, I'll do it.
I'll get it.
ALEX/ 7-6.
Here you go.
Jim, Jim we got it.
Nice meeting you all.
Nice to meet you, Kirk.
See you tomorrow night, Elaine.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
So long, Kirk.
Great guy.
Yes, he's very nice.
Okay?
Uh, he seemed a little pushy to me.
Anybody notice who's been going around singing lately?
Is it me?
Yes.
I've certainly noticed a change in a certain person's morale in the last ten days or so.
I'm not denying it.
It goes beyond singing.
I've noticed somebody walking around whistling and giggling like a schoolgirl.
That's a lie.
Not you, Jim-- Elaine.
Oh, Elaine, uh, it wouldn't have anything to do with your seeing a lot of this Kirk Bradshaw lately, now would it?
He's a terrific guy.
I'll get it!
So, Elaine, we're pretty good matchmakers, huh?
Oh, will you quit gloating?
Although, I must admit that you picked out a better one for me than I usually do.
Oh, a winner the first time out.
Mr. Banta, congratulations.
Nardo Hey, Tony, it's for you.
It's the guy from the gym.
He says you owe a towel fee from April.
He's crazy.
I didn't shower in April.
Hey, Louie, come on, huh?
Get us out of here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, here you go, here you go.
Dames.
Sheesh.
"Sheesh," Louie?
Yeah.
No matter how many bums a woman dates, whenever a new one comes along, she thinks this one is going to be Mr. Right.
You ever notice that?
Notice it?
I depend on it.
Come on, Lou.
Rieger, do you hate anything as much as I hate Wheeler?
I doubt it.
Have a terrible evening, Lou.
Same to you, Rieger.
Ignatowski!
Yo.
Starship 314.
Banta, come on, look alive here!
One second, Lou.
One second.
Hey, hey.
Who are you?
Kirk Bradshaw.
And who are you?
In here, God.
Oh, oh.
Kirk.
Kirk Bradshaw.
Oh, you're the young fellow who's dating our Miss Nardo.
That's right.
How far did you get?
Come on.
Come on, a little guy-talk here.
Did you hit a home run?
Come on, I'm not going to tell anybody.
I'm not going to tell you anything about my relationship with Elaine.
Well, some friend you are, Kirk.
What was that about?
Aw, he's a jerk.
Hey, so, how you doing, Kirk?
Pretty good.
Pretty good, you son of a gun, you.
You and Elaine seeing a lot of each other.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you son of a gun, you.
That's why I stopped by, I wanted to talk to her.
Well, you just missed her.
She just went out.
Oh?
Just as well, I guess.
What's the matter, you two got a problem?
Yeah.
I'm afraid so.
I've been meaning to talk to her about it ever since I met her.
I just can't seem to be able to.
Well, sit down.
Tell me about it.
Come on.
See I'm in a tough spot.
I really like Elaine You son of a gun, you.
Tony, the problem is I like somebody else, too.
Oh somebody else.
Oh, man, that's a problem.
It is a problem, Tony.
I feel bad about it.
I honestly never meant to get involved with Elaine.
Remember the night I came up to you two at the bar?
I said, "Are you two together"?
Yeah, I told you we weren't.
Well, she wasn't the one I was after, Tony.
Oh, no?
No.
Oh, no, no, no, no Banta, what the hell's going on here?
You're supposed to be out on the road.
I ain't going, Louie.
I got a problem.
Aw, not again.
The one on the left's the brake.
The one on the right's the gas.
Louie, leave me alone.
Something's really bothering you, huh, Banta?
Yeah.
So, why haven't you unloaded it on Rieger?
'Cause everybody's always unloading on Alex, and it's terrible for him.
I ain't dumping this one on him.
Oh Oh, I see what you're getting at.
Well, who else in this cab company would offer the maturity, the character, and poise required to be a real confidant?
Uh You pick me or your butt's flying out of here.
No way you can make me tell you this, Louie.
Okay, okay, Tony.
All right.
I know exactly how you feel.
I got problems of my own.
You ain't got no problem like this one.
Maybe, maybe not.
I don't know anything about your problems so I really don't know.
But my problems yecch!
Yecch!
I'll tell you, some of them ah, I just don't even want to think about them.
Especially that one.
What one?
Ah, never mind.
Believe me, there's nothing in this world that I'd like better than to share this with another human being.
I mean, just one time to have another person understand what I live with every day of my life.
You know, if there was anybody that I would tell, it would be you, Tony.
My paisano.
Aw, I just can't do it.
Unless Unless what?
Well if you were to tell me about that little problem of yours-- I mean, just as an act of faith-- Oh, I don't know.
Oh, no, no, never mind, never mind.
This is better kept in the deep, dark recesses of my soul.
Hey, Louie, it's not good to keep things inside you where they can eat at you.
Okay, Lou, let's trade secrets.
Thanks, Tony.
All right, I'll tell you what.
Just so that neither one of us has to say these things out loud, we'll write them on a piece of paper, and then we'll trade secrets.
Good idea, Louie.
Pencil.
Oops.
I got it.
Okay.
Oh, I can't go through with this.
I can't go through with this.
Oh, come on, Lou.
It will help you.
I think it's helping me.
Paisan.
All right, but after, we'll burn the pieces of paper.
Sure.
"The guy Elaine is going out with just made a pass at me"?
Oh Now I'll read yours, okay?
"Ha, ha".
Ha, ha.
Hey, Louie Ha, ha.
You're my favorite, Banta!
Hey, Tony, how's it going?
Not great.
Why aren't you drinking?
I can't-- I had to give all my money to Louie.
To Louie?
Hey, let me have a couple of beers.
How come?
What for?
Never mind, it's a long story.
Hey, I got something I got ask you-- a problem.
What do you call one of them questions that didn't happen but you ask it like it really did?
Hypothetical?
Right-- hypothetical.
Okay, let's say you're dating a girl, and you really like her, and she makes a pass at me.
Would you want me to tell you?
How come you're asking me that?
It's just hypothetical.
What are you getting so weird about?
Well, it's kind of a strange question to come out of the clear blue sky, Tony, you know?
Bobby, I'm just asking you I know why you're asking me.
It's Debbie, isn't it?
Huh?
Well, she's pulled that little trick once too often.
I'm going to tell her we're through.
Thanks a lot, Tony.
I owe you one.
Bobby, is Tony in there?
Yeah, he's inside.
Tony Did Kirk stop by the garage after I left tonight?
Kirk?
Yeah.
No, I didn't see any Kirk.
No Kirk.
No, I didn't see Kirk.
No?
What gave you that idea?
Oh, Alex said he thought he saw him as he was driving off.
Well, I sure didn't see any Kirk.
Hmm Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I just have something on my mind.
Aw, you want to talk about it?
I haven't decided yet.
Mm well, okay.
Well, I'm going to be home if you want to call, okay?
Thanks, Elaine.
Okay.
I got to go.
Bye.
Hello, Tony.
Hello?
What's the matter?
You're too sad to talk?
Okay, I do your part for you then.
Hello, Tony.
: Hello, Latka.
How you doing there?
Fine.
How are you?
Hey, I'm okay.
How you doing?
I'm all right.
Why don't you sit down, have a seat there.
Well, I'd like to, but I don't have any money.
That's all right.
You're my pal.
Pals don't need no money.
Have one on me.
All right.
Thank you very much.
You're very nice.
Hello?
What's the matter, you have the blues?
Well, why don't you order some drinks, and we can talk about it.
I can't.
I got no money.
And, anyway, I don't think you'd understand my problem.
Yes, I would.
I don't think so.
You know anything about bisexuals?
Of course.
They are very popular in my country.
They are?
Yeah.
Oh, almost everybody have them.
And, uh, one of our favorite sports is racing them.
And when we are not when we are not using them, we have special racks where we chain them up at night.
Latka, I'm not talking about bicycles.
I'm talking about bisexuals.
So am I. Listen, I hope that you feel better, all right?
Good-bye.
Take it easy.
Hi, Latka.
Hello, Alex.
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Alex.
Can I have a beer, Charlie?
Hey, Alex, uh Yeah?
I really tried to work this out myself but, uh I got the worst problem of my whole life, Alex.
Now, hold it, hold it.
Hold it right there.
Just hold it right there.
I've decided I'm not going to listen to any more sentences that start like that.
Now, wait No, I'm serious.
There are a lot of sentences that I will listen to-- I mean, ones that start with, "Alex, I'd like to pass on a compliment".
"Alex, I've got a woman for you".
"Alex, I want to give you money".
Those are sentences I will listen to.
But, "Alex, I've got the worst problem of my life" is right up there with, "Alex, is that thing on your neck getting any bigger"?
I don't want to hear that.
No, I'm through listening to them.
I'm through solving other people's problems.
I'm no longer in that line of work.
The office is closed.
The doctor is out.
Sally doesn't live here anymore.
You finished?
Yes.
What's your problem?
Oh Oh, Alex, I really did try to spare you from this, but, uh, I'm not so sure the guy that Elaine's going out with is right for her.
That's your problem?
Tony, Tony, what are you worried about?
We picked a winner.
That's your problem?
Besides, who are we to decide who's right or wrong for Elaine?
Yeah, that's right, except for one thing.
Nothing.
Well, except this one thing.
What one thing?
He wants to date me.
No Yeah No.
You must have misinterpreted what he meant.
Well, he said my simplicity was engaging, and that we'd be wonderful together.
Oh, no.
See, now, the point is, here, Alex, is this could go rough on Elaine.
If she's getting serious about him, she should know.
So should I tell her?
No.
I say he ought to tell her.
Someone's got to talk to Kirk and set him straight, as it were.
Thanks, Alex.
Let me know how it turns out.
No!
No!
No!
I'm not going to do it.
For once in my life, I am not going to let this thing get dumped in my lap.
You tell him.
All right, I know it's my job.
But you think you could come along with me?
I mean, you don't have to say nothing.
All you got to do is sit there and be a buddy.
Come on, Alex.
Please, please, please, please.
All right, all right.
I don't understand.
Why can't you do this by yourself?
I can't be alone with him.
I'm the one he spends tortured nights dreaming about.
He said that?
No.
I'm just assuming.
Alex.
Oh, hi, Kirk.
Hello.
Hi.
How you doing?
Is Tony here yet?
No.
He called and said he'd be delayed.
Oh.
That gives us a chance to chat.
Yeah, sure, okay.
This is a gay bar, isn't it?
Yeah, sure.
This your first time here?
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean by saying "yes" so quickly that it'd be terrible if I'd been here before, because, well, actually, it would not have been terrible if I'd been here before.
You know, I've been meaning to.
Just out of curiosity, of course.
I don't mean you're a curiosity, but I, I mean.
Let's not chat anymore.
I used to be such a good chatter, you know.
Look, uh, Kirk, I I have a really terrible uh, difficult thing to talk to you about, and I don't even know how to start.
Alex, I think I can guess what you're trying to tell me.
You can?
But I've already told Elaine that I'm bisexual.
Shh.
Oh, okay.
It's okay here.
I'm sorry.
Anyway, we're still friends, and we had a fine talk.
Oh, and by the way, I understand that Tony's not interested and that's okay, too.
Oh wow.
Can we have a couple of beers?
Sure.
Hey, Chief, can we get a couple of beers?
Well, I thought this was going to be difficult, but instead, it's a snap.
Boy, am I a lucky guy.
Excuse me.
Would you like to dance?
Just for the sake of optimism, no, go ahead, I don't mind.
No, I meant you.
Oh, no, no.
I'm just having a beer with a pal.
Thanks.
Come on, don't be shy.
No, no, no, no, I really can't.
It's okay with me.
Whoa.
* *  Oh, good step.
Duck!
What?
Thanks, pal.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, one, two, three, ha!
One, two, three, go!
One, two, three, step!
One, two, three, dance!
One, two, three, dance!
Alex, Elaine's heart is getting broken.
You're having a great time here dancing.
I'll never understand how you could have let that happen.
I don't care what you say.
I would never dance with that guy.
No, not you, you little heartbreaker.
Give me my trophy.
Hi, guys.
Hiya, Jim.
Hey, Jim, what do you say?
Hey, Alex, what's that for?
For acting like a jerk.
Why doesn't anybody ever tell me about these contests?
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
My name is Spencer.
I'm an investigator.
I'm looking for a Jim Ignatowski.
Ohh I guess that's Ignatowski.
Yeah, well, uh, it could be.
Uh do you have business with Mr. Ignatowski?
Well, like I said, I'm a private investigator.
I was hired to find him.
Oh.
Is the fuzz still here?
Only on your brain.
He ain't the fuzz, Jim.
He's a private dick.
Oh, Mr. Ignatowski.
You sure have been a hard man to find.
Well, I've been in the bathroom.
You know, it's pretty difficult tracking down a man whose last known address was a '63 Volkswagen.
And then, what really threw me off was the name change.
You used to be Jim Caldwell, right?
Jim, you changed your name to Ignatowski?
Yeah.
You know it was the '60s and everybody was changing their names to stuff like Sunshine, Free Moon Unit.
Well, Jim, why Ignatowski?
Huh!
Say it backwards.
Ikswotangi.
Uh-oh.
That's not even close to "Star Child," is it?
Well, look, my job here is to deliver this to Mr. Ignatowski.
Here you are.
Thanks.
See you around.
Okay.
What is it?
What's what is it?
What is it, Jim?
Wow.
What is it?
It's written in some strange language unknown on this planet.
Jim, Jim Who's it from?
Where where do I find that?
There.
It's from my father.
It's been a lot lot of years, lots of years years and years  Jim, Jim?
Pardon my intrusion.
That's okay.
I didn't even hear it.
No, no.
Jim, Jim what does what does your father want?
Now, where do I find that?
Huh?
Here.
Give me this.
Let me see that.
Hey, look at this.
He sent him two plane tickets to Boston.
First class.
Hey Wait a minute.
A limousine will pick you up there.
Says he's getting along in years.
He was making out his will and he decided that he wanted to see his family again.
Wow.
Is your father wealthy, Jim?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He-he's rich.
We lived on a big ranch.
My dad taught me how to be a man.
Huh?
Me and my two brothers-- little Joe and Hoss.
Jim, that's Bonanza.
Oh, yeah.
But my father's wealthy.
A very wealthy man.
In fact, he's probably a millionaire.
This is incredible.
My God, you know, you are the last person that I'd expect from this garage to have come from the upper crust.
Hey, Jim, how come you're not rich, too?
Well, uh, Dad and I had a parting of the ways.
He threw me out of the house.
I see.
So, uh, you think you'll go home?
I don't know.
Be interesting to see him.
You know, it's a terrible thing to forget the kind of people you come from.
Yep.
You know, once a month like clockwork, I call him on the phone and hang up just so I can hear his voice say "For the last time, who is this"?
I'm going to the airport right now All right and catch me an airplane.
Aw, great, Jim.
That's a good idea.
It's the right choice.
Okay Anybody want to go with me?
Huh?
Huh?
What do you mean?
Dad sent me two tickets.
Must have thought I was married or had a friend.
One of you could come along.
No, no, no.
I can't make it.
Okay.
Now, now, now let's not fight over this.
There's only one fair way to settle it.
I'll think of a number between one and ten.
Hmm?
Yeah.
Okay.
Sounds all right.
All right, Jim.
All right.
Uh ah I got it.
What is it?
Three.
I'll take ten.
Tony?
Ten?
Uh, ten for me, too, Jim.
You're not gonna believe it-- but I always take ten.
Boy, what are the odds of that happening?
All right Well let's try it again, and I'll take six.
See if that works.
What's your number, Alex?
Well, I guess my number is six.
Now we're getting someplace.
What's your number, Elaine?
No, no, no, no.
Jim.
No, Jim, no Huh?
I-I want to go.
Your father sent two tickets, one for a friend.
I'm the friend.
Oh, gee.
Dad's a pretty smart guy, huh?
What are you guys doing here?
Go home.
Hey, boss I'm not going to be driving for a couple of days.
I'm going home to Boston to see my dad.
Ignatowski's got a father?
There goes my spore theory.
Jim, come on.
Let's get out of here.
Dad.
I think he's a butler.
I don't care what he does for a living.
He's my father.
No, Jim.
He's your father's butler.
Huh?
Hi.
Um, I'm Alex Rieger.
This is Mr. Caldwell's son.
I'll tell your father you're here.
May I take your luggage?
Oh, thank you.
Well Dad.
You look even younger than you used to.
I'm your brother, Tom, Jim.
Oh.
Of course, Tom-Jim.
This is my brother, Tom-Jim.
Tom.
And you're..
?
Uh, extremely uncomfortable.
I'm-I'm Alex Rieger.
Hi.
Tom Caldwell, the son that lived.
Jim?
Lila?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy!
It's my sister, Lila.
Lila, I'd like you to meet my brother, Tom-Jim.
Hi.
And my friend, Alex Rieger.
Oh, hi.
Oh Want a bite?
Pardon me?
Oh, no, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Lila is a tad shy at first, but she'll warm up to you.
Nice family, Jim.
Uh thanks.
Promise me you won't leave me alone with them.
Thanks.
Wow.
Boy, it's all coming back to me, Alex in bits and pieces.
Hey, Jim, is that your mother?
Yeah.
I don't remember her much.
She passed away when I was a kid.
But she never took off those white gloves.
After she died, I was raised by a nanny.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
A fat, sweet-tempered black lady.
She used to laugh at me all the time and scold me.
For some reason, she used to call me Miss Scarlett.
Jim, that's Gone With the Wind.
Yeah no use looking back on it now.
Is my son in there?
This could be my dad or your dad.
Son.
No.
Dad?
James it's good to see you.
You're bald.
Yes, I am.
You haven't got hardly a hair on your head.
No, I haven't.
You see this, Alex?
James, it's been a very long time.
Yes, it has, Dad.
Where did all your hair go?
Uh, Mr. Caldwell, I'm Alex Rieger.
Hi.
I'm a friend of Jim's.
Listen, I guess you guys have a lot to talk about, and I'll just wait right outside.
Don't go.
Uh please, stay, uh Why don't you both sit down?
Thank you.
Well, James, we have a lot to talk about.
A lot's happened, and I want to know everything-- where you've been, what you've done.
I want to put all the unpleasantness behind us.
Thought about a toup?
: Jim You know, some people think that baldness makes a man look distinguished.
Thank you, Mr. Rieger.
Well, what about the fat part?
I'm the same size as when you left here.
Oh, yes!
Now I remember.
Everybody here was fat.
James, don't we have other things to talk about?
It's good to see you, Dad.
I missed you.
All you had to do was call.
Dad, I did.
Once a month, no matter where I was, for the last ten years, I called just to hear your voice.
Is that the number you've had for the whole time?
My God, I-I've been estranged from the wrong family.
I don't know how to talk to him.
Is he, uh?
Um Mr. Ignatowski Uh No, no.
I mean, Mr. Caldwell, I I can assure you that in the year and a half that I've known Jim, he's grown incredibly.
Oh, my God.
Uh, I'll have Carl show you to your rooms.
Oh, thank you.
You have the same room, James.
Even your toys are still there with the exception of the airplane glue.
You finished all of that.
By the way, we usually dress for dinner.
Well, I certainly Fine, fine.
Fine, thank you.
Alex, I love him.
It's amazing.
I haven't seen him for so long.
He's changed physically.
And we never were very close.
And I've been talking to a different voice.
But there's something about being here that has stirred me.
It's in the genes.
It's in those chubby little genes.
Yeah, well, that's-that's fine, Jim, that's fine.
I mean, I mean, that's why you came here, right?
I don't love my brother, Alex.
That's all right, Jim.
I don't know why.
He's almost as fat as my dad.
My sister I love a little.
And I like the butler, and you've been terrific.
Okay.
Can we go home now?
No, no, no, Jim.
Not yet.
Not yet.
You mean, there's more?
Mm-hmm.
What else are we having tonight, Carl?
Everything but string beans, sir.
Uh, Mr. Rieger, if you like string beans we can No, no, sir.
Thank you very much.
I have enough to pick from right here.
You just reach out and grab anything you like.
Lila, don't be cheap in front of the company.
Sorry, Daddy.
Well, Jim, we have a lot to talk about.
I guess so.
You like potatoes au gratin or cottage fries?
Uh I don't like potatoes.
Still the rebel without a cause, huh?
James, why don't you tell us about your life since you dropped out of Harvard?
Jim, you went to Harvard?
Uh yep.
He was there for a year.
Got excellent grades one semester.
The next semester, he wrote all his term papers in finger paint.
A typewriter seemed so impersonal.
James, I would seriously like to know what the past ten years of your life have consisted of.
Uh Huh?
No, I've only known you for the last year and a half.
Would that be?
No.
No.
W-What have you been doing with yourself?
Drifting?
Living on handouts?
Getting stoned?
Well, don't make it sound so terrible.
How do you make that sound good?
Well, drifting  You know, living on handouts.
And getting stoned.
It's disgusting.
To throw away the opportunities you had-- the education, the breeding.
You know, and you you don't really feel ashamed, do you?
No.
Do you feel remorse?
No.
What do you feel?
Full.
Uh-huh.
I'd hoped the years had changed you, James, but fact of the matter is you don't give a damn, do you?
You never have, and I don't think you ever will.
Well, sir, your presence in this house is no longer appreciated.
Well, Jim, uh excuse me.
I-I think I'd better have a word with your father.
Look, Mr. Caldwell, I-I don't want to interfere in your family's affairs, but I feel Mr. Rieger you may not believe this, but James was always my favorite.
I can believe that.
I'd give anything if even one of my children had turned out to be someone I could respect.
James was always special.
You should have seen him as a child.
I do.
Mr. Caldwell, the only damage that Jim's ever done to anybody has been to himself.
He's done his share of that.
My problem is that the tax laws force me to give out the bulk of my money now.
Would you give a million dollars to your Mr. Ignatowski?
Look, Mr. Caldwell, I don't think that money is an issue here for Jim.
I mean, I think he came here because he had a real desire to be with his family again.
I don't think the money is important to him.
You really believe that?
Yes, I do.
Mm-hmm.
James, get in here.
We'll soon see which one of us is right.
Hello again.
James, I'm giving away most of my money.
I haven't decided what the distribution is going to be among my children, but I have come to one decision.
You're not getting anything.
Okeydoke.
I don't believe it.
Jim, your father thinks you came here to get his money.
Dad thinks that?
Boy, now I'm burned!
It may take a lot to get me mad, but this did it.
Don't stop me, Alex!
I'm going to say what's on my mind.
What was that last thing you said?
Your father thinks you came here to get his money.
Dad thinks that?
!
Oh!
Hopeless.
Now, you look here.
The reason I came here was to see you-- to see my dad, to see my family-- and show you all that I'm back on my feet again.
And show you that I'm okay, and you don't have to worry about me anymore.
Dad I came here because I wanted to find out who I am, who you are, who we all are.
I mean, I wonder about these things, Dad.
Like, I wonder about if you call an orange an orange why don't you call a banana a yellow?
Or an apple a red?
Well, you see, the point is, Mr. Caldwell Now, blueberries make sense, but somebody explain gooseberries to me.
James you really don't care about my money?
Nah, I don't care.
Give it all away to what's his name-- the big guy with the curly hair.
Your brother.
Or him.
Oh.
You are not without charm, my son.
Thanks.
All right.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'm willing to try, if you are.
If you want to be my son and feel what it's like to be a rich man, then come home, enroll in school.
I'll see that you get the best education and the best shave that money can buy.
All you have to do is take some responsibility for yourself and lead a decent, normal life.
Good-bye, Dad.
He's not coming back, is he?
No, sir, I don't think so.
Well, uh, listen thanks for everything, Mr. Caldwell.
JIM : Alex!
: What?
What are you doing?
I'm saying good-bye to your father.
Oh.
Tell him it was really great seeing him again!
Uh, I think he wanted me "It was really great seeing" You heard And get his right phone number!
Excuse me.
Uh Got it!
: Jim!
JIM : Yo!
It was really good seeing you again.
Really son.
: It was really great seeing you again, too, Dad!
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Louie!
Yeah.
Cockroach at 10:00.
Oh, my God!
That's the biggest cockroach I've ever seen!
That's a man-eater.
I'm going up after it.
Careful, Louie.
Give me something, give me something.
Here.
Did you see that?
I hit him dead center with everything I had, and he just smiled at me.
Here he comes!
Well he's gone now.
Yeah he's gone.
But he'll be back.
Jim, I-I'm expecting an important call.
Just a short call, please, okay?
Okeydoke.
Thank-thanks a lot.
Who am I calling?
You mean, you weren't going to use the phone?
No, I-I was going to the bathroom.
Oh.
But I'll make that short, too.
Tony, what's with Bobby with the phone?
Oh, today he finds out whether he got that movie part he's been trying for.
It's between me and another guy.
I wish they'd call already.
The suspense is killing me.
Oh, Bob, Bob, come on.
It's not the last job you're going to lose.
I mean, uh, no, I mean, uh Hey, what kind of attitude is that?
I mean, come on.
Let's assume Bobby's going to get the job and approach it with a positive attitude, you know.
Sorry, Bob.
Yeah.
Let him hear the negative things after he loses it.
Oh, no, no, sorry.
That's okay, Elaine.
I still think I have a damn good chance of getting this.
Well, good.
That's the way to think, Bobby.
Ifnosh cafe?
Latka, Latka, I'm waiting for an important call.
Uh, this is important, too.
I am ordering my lunch.
You see, there is a restaurant just open up, and they serve food from my country.
Yeah, but-but it's all right.
Hello?
Yes.
Oh, yes, hello.
Yes.
Hello.
Thank you, and you, too.
I know.
I would like to order some food, please.
Okay.
First, I would like to order a tossed gravlitee.
I would like to okay and a fried yufnish in the basket.
And a a profnika with everything.
Yes.
Yes, and two large Latka, is there any way you could do this faster?
Oh, sure.
Just give me the number seven.
Thanks.
Hi.
Yeah, this is he.
Yeah, I-I-I understand.
Um Yeah, thanks for calling.
Well, come on already.
The suspense is killing me.
You get it or not?
Banta, sometimes I wish you were smarter just so you'd know how dumb you are.
The other guy beat me out.
You know, I've lost jobs before, but what kills me about this one, is the guy I lost it to has almost no experience, and he's not very good.
The only reason he got this job is because of his looks.
Oh, come on, Bobby.
You're great-looking.
No, you see, they didn't cast him because he's better looking than me.
They cast him because he has the right look.
You see, casting, it goes in cycles.
Common looks are in now.
It's a handicap to be classically handsome.
Don't I know it?
You see you see the type they want now is long on street looks, short on brains.
Somebody engaging, with a boyish smile, animal magnetism and a dumb but earnest face.
Somebody like Go ahead and say it, Bobby.
Somebody like Tony.
All right!
Hear that?
Hey, thanks a lot.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, this is it.
I'm done.
I'm through.
I don't want to be an actor anymore.
My career is dead.
Thank God-- it suffered long enough.
Bobby?
Dropped by to see how you're doing.
How you doing?
Okay, for a guy whose career is over.
Ah, that's good.
I thought you'd still be depressed or something.
I brought beer and Fudgesicles.
Look, uh, Tony, I-I don't feel much like talking now, you know?
Well, uh, how do you feel about answering?
I could make up a question, you could answer it.
Okay, um, I was wondering, Bobby, could you tell me how to be an actor?
Are you kidding?
You said I was what they were looking for.
Tony, do you have any idea what acting is like?
Hey, Bobby, when I was in grade school, I had a part in the play Rip Van Winkle.
I know I shouldn't ask this.
What part did you play?
I was the guy that woke him up.
Hey, Bobby, you think it's easy waking a guy up after he's slept 40 years?
Tony, you got Fudgesicle all over your face.
Listen, how do you get an acting job, Bobby?
Well, you're asking the wrong guy.
But, uh, you get an agent who introduces you to casting directors who introduces you to producers who hire you.
Well, that's sounds okay.
Let's do it like that.
Tony, it's not that easy.
Come on, you have no experience.
Wake up.
Rip, wake up, Rip.
Wake up, Rip.
Almost no experience.
You told me the guy who beat you out yesterday for that movie part had almost no experience.
And he wasn't even that good, but he looked right.
So, if I look right, why can't I get parts, too, Bob?
I don't Hey, maybe you could.
What the hell.
I'll call my agent.
The worst he can do is laugh, right?
Uh, Bobby, I don't think I want your agent.
And why not?
I mean, he hasn't exactly made you a star, you know.
Tony, Tony, what is it that you want?
Bobby, I want you to be my agent.
You're my friend, you'd look out for me.
Tony, Tony, that's crazy.
Why?
You got extra time now, especially if you're not gonna act anymore.
Tony, you don't know what you're saying.
Bobby, Bobby, listen.
I saw that movie The Raging Bull, right?
Yeah.
And I read someplace where a lot of the guys in that movie weren't real actors.
Some of them were fighters just like me.
Bobby, Bobby, listen, man.
I'm serious about this.
Bobby, I know this sounds crazy, but all my life, I felt I was gonna be something special.
I thought I was gonna be famous.
I know that sounds crazy, but that's the way I felt.
I always thought all this time I was gonna be famous as a boxer, but when you said "actor," it hit me.
That's where I belong.
You do have the right face for it.
That's what I think, too.
A girl I once dated said I was an Italian Sylvester Stallone.
Yeah, I think the world is waiting for one of those.
And Bobby, when I make it, you're in all my movies.
Oh, hey, what the hell?
You know, you may be a natural.
You know, sometimes that happens.
You may have more talent than either one of us realizes.
That means you'll do it?
Yeah.
All right.
I can't believe this.
I am going to manage you.
What do we do?
What do we do?
Okay, now, hey, we got a lot of work to do.
Now first of all, I want you to take these plays home.
Here, here, here.
And I want you to read them, I want you to study them, I want you to get familiar with them.
And then tomorrow, we start working together.
All right, Bob.
Now, listen, we're gonna do this right, right, Tony?
Okay.
Hey, Bobby, this is gonna be a great partnership.
You bet it is.
Hey, Bobby, this is one of my favorites-- Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.
I seen the Disney version.
You're still looking for that stupid bug, aren't you?
Stupid bug?
Nardo, I'll have you know that cockroaches were around before dinosaurs.
You think they stayed around that long by being dumb?
If he could see over a dashboard, I'd have this one driving a cab.
I've never seen you so nervous before.
I'm not nervous.
I'm just a little curious.
And I'm trying to do my part for the hygiene What's that?
!
I couldn't resist.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Nardo, when I catch this one, I'm gonna fix you up with it.
Hey, guys, want to see some pictures I had taken for auditions?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Three poses for 50 cents.
And what's this one for?
The one where you're like this?
That's to show I can do comedy.
Bobby, look at these pictures I had taken.
I figure we can show 'em to casting people.
Show business is tough.
Look, Tony, don't worry about that kind of stuff, huh.
I've taken care of it.
I've been all over town the last couple of days.
Every casting director in this city has your picture on his desk.
Isn't he great?
And he's doing it for only ten percent of my earnings.
Look, uh, I want you to read a scene for me.
It's a scene from Long Day's Journey Into Night.
Now you're the youngest son, and you're trying to explain to your father that you've never felt at home anywhere.
Okay.
Go ahead, stand up.
: It was a great mistake, my being born a man.
I would have been much more successful as a seagull or a fish.
Okay, hold it, Tony.
I want to give you some direction.
I want you to listen to me.
I want you to start over again, and I want you to think about what you're saying.
I want you to feel the words, feel the emotion.
Trust everything.
Leave that pain open, okay?
Now-now go with it.
Now just Take a moment.
Take a moment, and breathe.
: It was a great mistake my being born a man.
I would have been much more successful as a seagull or a fish.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I want to ask you something.
I could not help overhearing.
Uh, I-I would like you could you to be my agent, too?
One time this Italian, uh, movie company come to my village to film a movie called Here Come the Huns.
Uh, do you want to see my performance?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, Tony Now in this scene, the-the terrible people, terrible men, the Huns, have gone burned everything to the ground.
And all the women and children, their bodies are lying around.
The crops are ruined.
Everything I have ever known is destroyed.
And so I am standing there, looking at, at all of this and it goes a little something like this.
Wait.
He's good.
I'll get it.
Hello, Robert Wheeler Management.
Yes, this is he.
Uh, my secretary stepped Yeah, I represent Tony Banta.
Just let me check those dates.
Well, I see that we're presently negotiating for a part in the new Jane Fonda film, which could tie him up during that period.
Yeah, it is.
It's pretty well set, but we're not locked in yet.
I tell you what, you give him an audition time and I can always work out something with Jane.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What was that?
What was that?
All right, he will be there.
All right, yeah, and thanks for calling.
I heard.
This is so exciting.
I can't believe it, your first audition.
Audition?
Hey, I want to hear about the Fonda film.
Arthur Kramer and Jerry Lowe, this is Tony Banta and Mr. Banta's manager, Mr. Wheeler, who'll be reading with him.
How do you do?
Sit down.
Nice to see you.
So, uh, Tony, you want to tell us something about yourself before we start?
No, but thanks for asking.
Okay.
Well, uh, why don't we just start the reading then?
Tony, the role you're playing is self-explanatory.
You're a young New Yorker of Italian descent-- eager, innocent and a little slow.
I'll give it a shot.
You two can start when you're ready.
Okay, Tony, I'm gonna start, all right?
Okay.
Okay, now, I play the part of the father; remember that.
Okay.
All right, uh, here, you stand over here so they can see your face better.
All right, you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
I'm ready.
"I understand if you hate me.
"I can't blame you for that, even if it hurts me more than I've ever been hurt".
: "Yeah, okay".
But at least try to understand.
You don't know what it was like for me all those years-- living a lie, pretending I was somebody that I wasn't, trying to drown that pain with booze and drugs.
Hey, listen.
No, let me go on.
This isn't easy for me, but you have to know.
I did my best.
Those years, they were hell for me.
Sometimes I thought I would go crazy.
Finally, there was nothing I could do but just run away from it, and I'm ashamed of that now.
But it was either that or taking my life with my own hands.
Son I'm so glad we can talk like this after all these years.
"Me, too".
Thank you.
Thank you.
I think we've heard enough.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, come on, Tony.
Yeah.
Can you start tomorrow?
Him?
You bet!
Are you saying you want him for the role?
Yeah, that's what we're saying.
We want him to start tomorrow in Long Island for some location shooting.
You, you're going to hire him after that reading?
Well, it's a small part.
You know, we'll get a dialogue coach to help him out a little bit with the lines.
He'll be fine.
Oh, uh, because he looks right.
Yeah.
Well, I think that's just dandy.
I mean, that's just wonderful.
You're going to cast him for his face because of the way he looks.
After the reading that he just gave you still want him.
I think that's just terrific.
You hire him, please, please hire him.
I mean, go ahead, go ahead and hire him.
Hey, why don't you hire him and give him the lead, you know.
Hey, hurry up.
Sign him to a long-term contract.
Quick, before somebody comes up and grabs him away.
Come on!
You know, you got a whole roomful of them out there.
Hire them all.
Just think, a whole picture of his face.
Come on!
Hey, any of you guys want a job?
Does he work for his ten percent or what?
Bobby, you here?
Hey, Tony, look, I'm really sorry what happened yesterday.
Something just snapped and I went crazy.
That's okay.
So, uh, how did your first day go as an actor?
Well, it had its ups and downs.
I went to Long Island.
Had some good coffee.
People treated me real nice.
I watched George C. Scott eat a jelly doughnut.
Then they fired me.
They fired you?
Yeah, the director didn't want me.
He said I wasn't right for the role-- or any role.
He used words like "wrong interpretation" and "artistic differences," "over my dead body" Tony, listen, I'm really sorry.
It's okay.
No, I know it meant a lot to you.
And if anybody knows how you're feeling right now Hey, Bobby, I'm sorry I let you down.
Tony, I got a confession to make.
As bad as you feel now and as bad as I feel for you, I'm glad you got fired.
Something better came through.
Well, no.
The Jane Fonda movie.
The director he was right.
How do you know?
You weren't even there, Bobby.
I didn't have to be there, he was right.
And thank God for that director.
Thank God, somebody finally stood up and fought for quality.
Hey, Bobby, I know you're the manager and I don't want to tell you your job, but isn't it about now you start building confidence?
Tony, don't you understand?
There are people who sacrifice food and clothing for acting lessons who freeze in the winter and are one step from hell in the summer living in poverty just so they can be in New York and step out onto a dark stage and give the best damn performance of their lives, just to hear, "thank you very much, next please" again and again and again.
Those people are actors, Tony.
And they do what they do, because they love acting.
See, when that director fired you today, it was like he was saying to all those people "I care"!
Do you know what that means, Tony?
It means that there are powerful people out there who still care about professionalism.
It means that acting and everything the theater represents is still alive.
Just 'cause I got canned.
Wow.
Tony, I'm gonna tell every actor I know what happened today.
You're going to be an inspiration for them to go on.
How does that make you feel?
It makes me feel great.
But I got to tell you something, I hope they don't expect me to bail them out every time.
: Well, good night, everybody.
Good night.
Everybody out of the garage.
All right.
: Ignore me, ignore me.
Yeah, I would, but what the hell are you doing?
Roach.
I put hamburger meat on the end of this.
When he nibbles-- yank his head off.
Louie, Louie, aren't you getting a little obsessed with this roach?
I mean, how big can the roach possibly be?
Rieger, this is not just a roach.
It's a roach.
He's got hairy legs.
He's got bloodshot eyes, Rieger.
What, what, what?
What are you looking at me like that for?
You got a bite.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Hey, hey!
Here it is!
Here it is, I'm on!
I'm on!
You're 11,000 feet high in the mountains.
You've brought down your last tree and then you sense it-- that BrickHauser feeling.
You're ready for America's boldest beer.
BrickHauser, the beer as cold and bold as the mountains themselves.
You were great.
You were brilliant.
It was a very good performance.
Thanks, Louie.
I'm not talking about you, ham hock.
I'm talking about this little show your friends are putting on.
You know, the best part about shooting that commercial was where we got to shoot it.
Three days up in the mountains-- it was just great.
Ever since I finished it I've been thinking about going back up there and spending some time, some weekend there.
Sounds good.
Hey, you want to go?
Hey, that sounds great.
Why don't we do it this weekend?
Why don't we do it for the whole week?
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Just us men against the elements.
All right.
I'd like to get some money down on the elements.
Come on.
What would the two of you do up in the mountains for a whole week?
What do you mean, what would we do up in the mountains?
We'd do what everybody does in the mountains.
Like what?
Mountain stuff.
Hey, I'm starting to get excited.
What are we going to bring?
Alex?
Huh?
You got to talk them out of this.
Me?
Yeah.
Well, what would you like me to say to them?
It's winter.
Do you realize that they have absolutely no experience in the wilderness?
Do you realize how dangerous that could be?
Besides which, they'll lose a week of work.
That's right.
Hey, guys count me in.
I'm going.
All right.
Great.
Whoo!
All right!
It's kind of chilly up there this time of year.
Yeah.
So I think we got to get a place with a heated pool.
No, no.
No, no.
Tony, Tony, I-I-I want basic, you know?
I want primitive.
I don't want any electricity, telephones-- no conveniences.
I've got just the place.
Where?
My apartment.
Jim, we were talking about something far out.
Hey Let me rephrase that.
We were talking about in the mountains.
Oh, okay.
Well, then let's just find the place in the mountains.
Great idea.
Hey, you want to go, Jim?
Uh yeah.
You know I do have, uh, some experience in these matters.
I used to live in a commune, you know.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Boy, we really roughed it.
Grew our own food, churned our own butter eh built our own shelters.
Anything we couldn't make for ourselves we traded for with another commune.
I had the best years of my life there.
If it was so wonderful, why'd you leave?
Uh they traded me  for a couple of goats and a, uh, and a Donovan album.
I yearn for the wide-open spaces.
Try looking between your ears.
Well, uh, even with Jim along, I think it might be rough.
Hey, we want it rough, Elaine.
Yeah!
We want to test our mettle.
We want to stand face to face with nature in its most raw.
Sounds stupid.
You don't understand it because you're a woman, Elaine.
I have no idea why I don't understand it.
Look at this place, huh?
We're in the middle of nowhere.
How far did we come from your place?
About 106 miles.
It's more like 106 miles since we left anything resembling a road.
Well, it's not too late to go back.
Hi, guys.
I love this.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
It's so quiet here you can actually hear yourself think.
I can't hear anything.
Anybody have a gun?
That's okay.
He's harmless.
No, I mean for hunting.
Ain't you going to do some hunting?
No, no, we don't We're not interested in hunting.
Well, you're gonna be up here for a week, shouldn't you at least have brought a gun along for protection?
Protection, from what?
Never know this far up.
Listen, I'd better leave you one of my rifles just in case.
I'd feel better if I did.
Sure.
Hey, look at this, man.
There's only one bed in this place.
A bed.
Which one of you men wants a bed?
Not me.
Not a chance.
You kidding?
Good.
It's loaded, so be careful.
All right.
We'll leave it over here in case you need it.
Maybe I better come up tomorrow or the next day and check on you guys.
Oh, no, really.
There's no need for that.
We can handle ourselves.
Okay.
I won't be back for a week and there's nobody else around here so, uh, if you're worried about anything think of it now.
Hey, we're fine.
Yeah, we're fine.
We're, okay.
Wait a minute.
Sir Alex, come on, we're okay.
Okay, okay, fine.
Thanks.
Wait a minute, sir.
How can we reach you?
Do you have a phone?
Yeah, I got a phone.
Oh, great!
But you don't.
Sir, one second.
Where's the nearest phone?
Well, that would be the one at my place.
Your place.
I'll see you Sunday.
You're a long way from the city, boys.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Pleasant sort.
What did he have to go and say something like that for?
Hey, the guy lives in the woods.
He probably talks to birds and squirrels.
Come on, let's unpack.
Hey, we better.
Our food's thawing out here.
Look at this, the stuff is dripping.
Come on, let's get this to the refrigerator.
Would you look at us-- looking for a refrigerator.
There's no electricity here.
Without a refrigerator all the food's gonna go bad.
With no food and no way out of here, we'll be dead by Wednesday.
Mountain man!
Mountain man!
Mountain man!
It's too late.
He left.
We're going to die.
Nobody's gonna die.
We just got to use our heads.
No-no time to panic now.
Hey, I got an idea.
It's a lot colder outside the cabin than it is inside, right?
Right, we can put stuff outside.
Oh Oh, terrific!
Hey!
Hey, I wish that guy could see us now, huh?
Yeah, we'll show old Hiawatha who can handle themselves, right?
Where does he come off trying to make us look so stupid?
You're telling me.
This is just great, everybody.
I mean, we're doing it, we are handling ourselves.
We're surviving.
That's what it's all about, right?
We don't need refrigeration, we don't need electricity.
Oh, boy, we're going to have a great week.
Check out the birdies and everything like that.
I love hiking.
Hiking's one of my favorites.
Oh, yeah, we can do that, too.
Were you in the scouts?
I was when I was a little guy.
The little old mountain man must have thought we were city slickers, huh?
How about that gun?
Yeah, protection, right?
Protection.
How's it going?
All right?
I don't know what you guys are worried about.
There's a whole ton of food out there.
Let's get to work.
Oh, boy.
Isn't this a great feeling?
You mean waking up in the mountains?
No, getting off the damn floor.
Did anybody get a good night's sleep last night?
I kept on being awakened by the growls of some big, hairy animal.
There it is again.
Wake up, Jim.
Where the hell am I?
It's okay, Jim.
It's okay, it's okay.
You're in the mountains.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, right.
Who are you?
I'm your friend Alex, Alex Rieger.
We work together.
Oh, oh.
What are we, lumberjacks?
No, we're cab drivers.
Oh, I bet we don't do much business up here.
You okay?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm all right now.
I think my brains are beginning to warm up.
I'm starving, huh?
What's for breakfast?
Well, I'll just go rustle up some grub from our little old refrigerator in the woods.
Now, what would you big lugs like?
Why don't you surprise us?
I'll do that.
Oh, wow.
You know, I'm really starting to feel great.
I could just spend the rest of my life up here.
Something ate all our food!
We're going to die.
We're going to die.
We're 100 miles from nowhere, and nobody's coming up for us for a week, and all our food is gone.
Bob Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You know what we're doing wrong?
We're not thinking like outdoorsmen.
What did the pioneers do in a situation like this?
They built cities and moved into them.
Come on, now, I'm being serious.
We're just going to have to use our heads again.
Yay-up.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I'm a fisherman.
I brought my fishing tackle.
I'll fish.
I like fish.
Hey, Tony, you can go kill something.
What are you talking about?
Well, Mark Trail, he left us his gun here, right?
You can go hunt.
Why me?
Well, because you've fired a gun before.
You were in the service, remember?
Mmm?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Uh Hey, what am I after?
Why don't you get us some steaks?
Bobby, he's not going to hold up a supermarket.
You shoot anything you find, Tony.
Anything.
Okay.
Well, I'll just get my fishing tackle ready and I'll head for the stream.
Okay.
I'm going to go forage.
Hey, good idea.
What does "forage" mean?
Close the door!
Man, it's getting cold outside.
Yeah, what did you shoot?
Nothing.
There ain't an animal around here.
That's crazy, Tony.
This is the woods.
Maybe word got out that I'm around.
Alex!
Well?
Well?
What did you catch?
What did you catch?
See for yourself.
Huh?
Huh?
Well?
Huh?
That the bait you used?
Bait?
That's my catch.
Well, do they puff up when you cook 'em?
Well, it's the only kind of fish I could find in the stream.
What did you even bring them back here for?
I thought you'd be impressed by the number I caught.
This one really put up a fight.
We're going to die.
Isn't anybody going to contradict me?
Hey, look, guys.
It ain't that bad.
I mean, tomorrow Alex can go out and fish some more, and I'll do some hunting.
I'm telling you, it's going to be a lot easier tracking animals in the snow.
The snow?
Hey, Bobby, look, it's snowing.
Ain't it great?
Big flakes!
Oh, no.
Now they can take our bodies down the mountain in a toboggan.
Somebody better fix this door.
Who's hungry?
You found something?
Blueberries!
Hurray!
Oh, blueberries!
Oh!
Bobby, Bobby!
I don't think they're blueberries.
Sure they are.
No, I mean they're blue berries, but I don't think they're blueberries.
These may be poisonous.
Excuse me, Alex.
I've eaten blueberries before, and they're not poisonous.
I know blueberries aren't, but these are not blueberries.
They look pretty darn blue to me.
Jim, I know they're blue berries.
What I'm saying is, they may not be blueberries.
And while all blue berries are blue not all blue berries are blueberries.
I-I-I see.
I've mistaken blue berries for blueberries.
Right.
Got you, Alex.
Cabin fever.
I was doing fine with my hunger for six days.
I just kept telling myself that guide's coming back Sunday.
And then when he didn't show up yesterday Oh, my hunger is really getting to me.
Well, let me tell you something.
If it's the snow that's keeping him away it's going to be a while before he gets here.
It's really deep.
Oh, my God.
What if it isn't the snow?
Maybe he died.
Maybe he had a heart attack.
That would be much too easy a death for the guy who rented us this cabin.
This is all your fault, Bobby.
My fault?
Yeah!
If you would have gotten a pineapple commercial we'd be in Hawaii now eating!
Come on, Tony, Tony, remember our deal?
No talk about food or eating.
Oh, oh.
Thank God for those minnows and blueberries.
I don't think we would have made it this far.
Bobby!
He didn't mean blue berries, Alex.
He meant blueberries.
Ohh.
What time is it?
Why?
Well, if it's 4:00, I get to suck the fish bones again.
You still got an hour.
You know, Alex, this is working.
You said we shouldn't think about food and I'm sitting over here not thinking about food and I feel a lot better.
That's good.
That's good, Jim.
That's good.
I'm not thinking about cheeseburgers.
I'm not thinking about pork chops.
I'm not thinking about pot roast.
I'm not thinking about Twinkies.
And I'm not thinking Jim!
Jim would you go out and get us some more wood, please?
I'm not thinking about minestrone.
I'm not thinking about peas.
Hey, you know something?
I'm full.
Hey, look.
Look, guys.
We're not licked yet, you know?
We can still try hunting.
Listen, I've been out, and I've been out, and I'm telling you there's nothing to shoot out there.
Well, that doesn't mean you won't find something today.
Yeah, listen, we can't give up.
It's a waste of time.
Well, what are we going to do?
Sit here and wait for dinner to walk through the door?
Jim!
Hey, Jim, what are you doing?
Huh?
What are you doing?
What are you  about?
I'm going  to get his attention.
Oh, you mean the guide's back?
Oh!
Don't scare it away!
Don't scare it away.
Oh, my gosh, it's some kind of large animal.
I think it's a big duck.
It's a turkey.
Ernie?
Ernie's a turkey?
Ernie?
Well, doesn't he look like an Ernie?
Let's get it!
Let's get it!
Come on.
Come on.
Come here!
Hey, this is crazy!
Let's go get the gun!
Oh, the gun!
Here, Tony.
You're the hunter.
Uh-uh.
I been hunting for a big ugly moose.
I ain't shooting no little birdie.
Bobby?
I don't want to do it, Alex.
I've never killed anything.
Well, I've never killed anything either.
But you've got the gun.
Oh, damn.
He does look like an Ernie.
Oh, boy.
Mmm.
Man, I hope this thing tastes good.
I never cooked nothing without directions before.
Oh, don't worry.
It's going to taste great.
Come on, Alex, let's eat.
Come on, Alex.
You couldn't help yourself.
Come on.
Come on, Alex.
What were we supposed to do, starve?
Yeah.
It was him or us.
Come on, come on.
Eat, eat.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Right, right.
Ah, come on, let's eat.
Dig in.
Dig in.
I think maybe we should say grace.
Are you nuts?
We haven't had a meal in a week.
All the more reason why we should give thanks.
Hey, I'm eating.
No, no, no, no.
Maybe he's right.
Look, we waited this long, we can wait a little longer.
Go ahead, Jim.
Lord, we know this bird was one of Your miracles.
No easier to create than a billion stars or a single grain of sand.
It was a truly magnificent creature, Your Honor.
And if we hadn't gotten so hungry, Your faithful servant Alex here would never have snuck up on it and blown its brains out But we grieve that one of Your creatures should have been sacrificed.
Though he could not think, he could feel.
And now he will never again walk Your good earth, smell the sweet air experience the glory of flying in Your heavens.
Taken from him is the precious gift of life.
One small innocent being lies here lifeless and we are diminished.
Amen.
Amen.
That's mine!
Save some for me!
Louie, I'm going to go home now.
So, uh, if Alex or any of the guys calls, would you call me at home, okay?
Do you have my number?
I always thought so.
Louie, please.
This is serious.
I'm really concerned about the guys so just knock it off.
Hey, I'm concerned too.
I'm worried sick.
Yeah, right.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Sunshine Cab.
Rieger?
Rieger, you okay?
Let me talk to him.
Yeah?
Oh, hang on a second.
There's somebody here who wants to talk to you.
Nardo, Nardo.
Come in here and talk to him.
Okay.
Alex!
Oh, my God!
I've been so worried about you guys!
Oh, my God!
What happened?
Tell me everything.
Yeah?
You're kidding me.
Oh, my G See, I knew it.
I knew it, I knew it.
I told you guys this.
So what did Bobby do?
I love this story!
I love it, I love it, I love it.
Jim, oh, my God!
This is amazing.
They had to get snow plows?
I can't believe it.
I just don't believe Wait till everybody at the garage hears this.
You guys must be exhausted.
My God.
Louie!
Uh hey, Rieger.
How you doing there?
Oh, oh, oh, Elaine?
Yeah, she did seem a little upset.
What the hell did you say to her?
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Latka!
Oh, Louie, hello.
Just the man I'm looking for.
Do you have the correct time?
My watch stopped.
The correct time is you're eight minutes late.
Oh, thank you.
Hold it, here, hold it.
This is serious.
I hope you got a good excuse why you're late.
Well, do you think that helping someone who was almost killed in an automobile accident is a good excuse?
No.
Then you're going to hate mine.
Hold it, hold it.
I'll let you off the hook this time 'cause you're not usually late, but get to work!
Okay.
Hey, Latka, is everything okay?
Oh, yeah, everything is fine.
The reason I was late is because I was dancing around my apartment with joy.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, what happened?
My beloved grandmother died.
That's good news?
No, that's terrible news.
Bobby, what kind of a person are you?
No.
The-the reason it's good news is because she left me something very valuable in her will.
Oooh.
What?
What?
Cookies.
She left you cookies?
But not just any cookies.
See, people used to come from miles around just to eat her cookies.
And so last night I go to the post office and I pick up the recipe and the package with the ingredients and I baked a batch.
You want to try?
Yeah.
I love grandmothers' cookies.
I love them.
Dig in, I hope you enjoy them.
Well, enjoy.
Well?
What do you say?
Well, they're, uh, not bad.
Did you swallow yet?
Did you swallow?
Mine seems to be getting larger.
I feel like I'm going to be chewing for the rest of my life.
You mean, you don't like them?
Well it's just it's just it's just the first taste.
I mean, maybe tomorrow we could have another bite.
You don't like them.
No, no, no.
Latka.
You know, tastes vary.
Tastes very what?
No, no, no.
Latka, what I'm trying to say is that, you know, maybe the people in your country would love them, but they might not taste the same to the people in our country.
I mean, that's perfectly understandable, don't you think?
I think that the people in America will love my cookies.
And I think I am going to sell them in the stores.
That's it, Latka.
I told you to get back to work, you foreign dog.
Now get back to work.
What?
Foreign dog?
I don't have to take this from you.
I don't even need this job.
I have the cookies.
And I am going to be rich and famous just like the famous Amos-- the chocolate chip cookie tycoon.
Oh, yeah?
Latka, I'm warning you.
No, Louie, I'm warning you.
You're warning me when I'm warning you?
I am warning you.
Yeah?
You're warning me?
Yes.
I am quitting.
Oh, no, you're not, Latka.
You're not going to quit, because I'm going to fire you.
You cannot fire me if I am going to quit.
No, no, no.
You can't quit because I'm firing you!
But you cannot fire me if I quit first.
I quit!
You're fired!
I said it first.
No, you didn't.
I quit!
You're fired!
I said it first again.
It doesn't matter who says it first.
It's who says it loudest.
You're fired!
You're fired!
You're fired!
You're fired!
I quit!
I quit!
I quit!
I can't hear you.
You're fired!
You're fired!
I can't hear you.
I quit!
I quit!
I quit!
You're fired!
You're fired!
You're fired!
Okay.
But I quit.
You're fired.
I'm fired.
You quit!
Thank you very much.
How you doing, Jeff?
The engine's back together.
Got a few pieces left over.
Close enough.
I'll give this cab to Wheeler.
Louie.
I don't know what I'm doing.
It's only temporary-- just until I can find somebody who will work as cheap as the guy I fired.
He quit!
Hey, Lou, want to have one of Latka's cookies?
I don't want any of his crummy cookies and I don't his name mentioned in this garage again.
Why, Lou?
You miss him?
I had gas I miss more than the guy I fired.
He quit!
You know, I'm really starting to like these.
I don't actually like them, but they're fun to chew.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
They kind of grow on you.
And they last forever in your mouth.
I put one on the bedpost last night.
Started on it again this morning.
Grandma Gravas' cookies might catch on.
I understand there are four stores willing to try them out.
Hmm?
Yeah.
Can you imagine Latka rich?
I'm back!
Hey, Jim!
Hey, Jim, welcome back.
So how was your trip?
Ah, great.
Omaha is lovely this time of year.
I thought you were hitchhiking to Washington.
I did too, but I ended up in Omaha.
I must have used the wrong thumb.
All right, let's get some cabs on the road here.
Nardo, 316!
Yeah, just a second.
Wheeler, 441!
Banta, 221!
Rieger, 544!
See you guys.
Hey, Jim.
Uh-huh?
It's great to be back!
Well, boss I'm back from my vacation.
You didn't happen to run into your brains while you were out there, did you?
No, but I wasn't really looking.
Well, I'll have a cab for you in a minute, Gulliver.
Okay.
What's all these cookies?
They were baked by a guy I fired.
He quit!
Ooh!
They got a nice little surprise inside.
What are you talking about?
Well, I could be wrong but I detect something in here that's a lot more powerful than oatmeal.
What's in them?
What's in them?
Well, let's check this out here.
Coca leaves.
Coca leaves?
Uh-huh.
You mean, the stuff they make cocaine out of?
Yeah.
Yeah, from, uh South America.
Peru, I believe.
Southern Peru.
'74, before the rains.
Poignant, but not overbearing.
Are you telling me that Latka is selling cookies with drugs in them?
Yeah.
Well, my duty as a citizen is clear-cut.
Yeah.
Jeff?
Get the police on the phone.
What do these, uh, coca leaves do to you?
Well, if you chew them for a while you get a feeling of euphoria, increased energy, strength and stamina.
It's also rumored to heighten your sexual desires.
And it makes you see beauty in the most repulsive things.
Did anyone ever tell you that you have the most adorable ear?
Police are on the phone, Louie.
Tell them to mind their own business.
Oh, Elaine?
She's not here.
What you got there, Lou?
Ah, nothing.
Hey, Lou!
Have you been noticing anything strange about me lately?
Uh strange?
Yeah.
No, no, no.
Nothing strange.
I don't know.
Feel like I'm sort of happy.
I got all this energy, you know?
Uh-huh.
So last night I had a little trouble falling asleep, so I wrote an opera.
An-an opera?
Yeah.
I never thought about writing an opera before, but it sounded like it would be fun.
It was.
I'm going to write another one tonight.
It just looks like, to me that you're in a good mood.
Yeah, well, maybe.
I wonder if any of the others are feeling this way?
I haven't noticed anything.
Hi, guys.
Hey, Bob!
What are you doing?
Huh?
What are you doing?
Afternoon Of The Faun.
There is definitely something weird going on here.
Hello.
Oh, Elaine.
Listen, uh Uh Nardo.
Have a cookie?
Oh, yes, thank you.
I've run out.
Louie, I've been having the most incredible perceptions today.
Do you realize the entire human experience of the universe can be summed up in one sentence?
Do I!
Hold that thought.
Why don't you come on into my cage here and we'll talk about that and sit right there and we'll have some cookies and a touch of the bubbly to wash them down your pretty little gullet.
No, no, no, Louie.
Louie, I'm serious.
I don't know why I never saw it before.
I have verifiable proof of the existence of God.
Later, later-- this stuff gets flat.
Damn it, I'm telling you there's something wrong here.
Bobby Wheeler is turning into a gazelle Elaine Nardo is in the chamber of horrors Here's the weirdest thing of all.
I'm standing here in the garage on my day off.
And I came in here just because I wanted, uh some more cookies Hey, Lou!
There's something wrong with these cookies.
Rieger, you're being a real drip.
No, I'm telling you, Lou, it's the cookies; they're doing something to us.
No, everybody's just having a good time.
Look at Banta, here.
He's eaten a billion of them.
There's nothing the matter with him.
Tony, how you feeling?
I'm fine.
Eh!
Ah, well, maybe you're right.
Maybe I am imagining it.
Anybody want any coffee?
Yeah, I'll have some.
Whoo!
Sixteen.
Come in.
Latka Hello, Alex.
How are you?
Fine.
Lat  About 24 bags by tomorrow supermarket, you know Look, Latka Isn't it wonderful how so much success I'm having with these cookies?
Everyone loves them so much!
You know, and I'm going to be rich and famous like Famous Amos, you know, but, you know, I would trade it all if I would only stop talking for one minute.
Latka, Latka, stop.
Latka, listen to me.
There's a drug in those cookies.
No no.
No Now, Latka, Jim says there's coca leaves in them.
What?
Coca leaves.
Coca leaves?
Oh that must be the secret ingredient.
Right.
That means it's going to ruin me.
I will not be able to sell my cookies anymore.
Well, I'm sorry about that.
Now I cannot do it and my dream is gone.
Oh.
No.
This explains why my grandmother's cookies were so popular with musicians in my country.
Latka, you think your grandmother knew that there was a drug in these cookies?
Oh, no, no, no.
She would not know that.
She was a very good woman, Alex.
A very busy, good woman.
She was always knitting doilies, you know?
A doily here, a doily there, Yeah.
doilies everywhere.
"Merry Christmas, Latka.
Here is a doily for you".
Oh, everywhere you look is doilies.
I'd like to give you a doily, you old bag!
I'll give you a doily!
I'll give you a doily!
Latka, Latka, Latka, calm down.
Calm down.
Oh, oh, oh, but what is happening to me, Alex?
I used to be such a sweet man.
I used to be so cute you could eat me up.
Yes, yes, yes.
I know you were.
I know you were.
But that's what happens to you when you take that drug.
Really?
That's why you got to kick it right now, right tonight.
You hear me?
You got to get rid of this.
How am I going to do it?
Well, look, first of all we got No more cookies.
Yeah?
We're going to get rid of all these cookies.
That's a good idea.
We'll start with this one.
No, no, no.
Latka, sit down.
Sit down.
Listen to me.
Look It's going to be a very tough night for you.
I mean, you're going to get nervous, you're going to get anxious.
You might even get sick.
You might even have hallucinations, delirium.
Latka, you're looking at the worst night of your life.
Now, I don't want you to worry about it.
I'm going to be right here going through the whole thing with you.
Thank you very much.
Alex, all my dreams are gone.
I thought I was going to be rich and famous like the Famous Amos.
See?
But now is nothing.
I thought I was going to finally get out of the garage.
You know, I did not want to be rich for the same reasons that other men want to be rich.
Oh, you mean not for the houses, the cars or the women?
Oh, maybe it was the same reasons.
But you know, I want to think but you know you know Let's try to get some sleep, all right?
I'll try.
I don't know if I could.
I'm going to stay up and watch you all night, okay?
All right, thank you.
Famous Amos.
I I don't believe it.
What's happening, Latka?
I don't know.
What's happening to you?
Boy.
Welcome to my home.
Thank you, but I'm not really here.
You're hallucinating.
Oh I'm only in your mind.
Well, then welcome to my mind.
If I knew you were coming I would have cleaned it up a bit.
Listen, man, I heard what happened to your cookies.
It's a tough break.
Oh, that's nice of you to say.
I came by because I wanted to say that success, fame, fortune-- all that stuff-- it's truly overrated.
Oh.
I wanted to tell you that the really important things in life are the simple things.
Oh, the simple things.
A sunset.
Yeah.
The smelling of a flower.
Mmm I'd like to tell you all of those things, Latka, but I can't.
Why?
'Cause it's a crock.
A crock?
That's right, a crock.
Hey, man, success is wonderful.
Yeah?
Cash is out of sight.
Oh Do whatever you can to be successful 'cause it's great.
Great.
And if it happens overnight, it's even better.
Hey, your cookies went down the tubes-- big deal.
Big deal.
Try cupcakes.
Try jelly rolls.
Aluminum siding.
Aluminum siding.
What's the difference?
Nothing at all.
Just get rich.
These are wonderful words.
Man, I just want to try to help, you know?
Well, thank you very much.
Give me five.
Keep the change.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Famous Amos.
Thank you for the hallucination.
It was wonderful.
Maybe we do it again sometime.
Oh, boy.
Alex.
Alex, wake up.
Alex, wake up.
Hmm?
I have something to tell you.
I just found out something very important about myself.
Alex, I want to be richer than anything.
I want to be richer than the Joneses.
I want to make lots of money, as much as I can.
I want to be rolling in money.
Alex you know something?
I just became an American.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Yes.
Yes, Mr. McKenzie.
Oh, yes.
I understand, sir.
Certainly.
When your wife comes in, tell her you're not here.
Yeah.
Very good, sir.
Oh, uh, by the way, uh, Mr. McKenzie, have I ever told you that you have a magnificent telephone voice?
Uh, well, have I told you today?
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry.
I was under the impression you liked it kissed.
Bye-bye.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Hi.
Hey, listen, I got a couple new exercises in that class I'm taking.
Oh, the pantomime class.
Yeah, you know, this mime stuff, it's really helping me in my, in my stage presence, you know?
You want to see a couple exercises?
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
Now, this is called "Man Walking".
That's a man walking, all right.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Hey, I got one.
Okay.
Tony, what is that supposed to be?
That's "A Man Standing in Garage".
No, that's "Dumb Man Standing in the Garage".
I love this.
A duel of wits between unarmed opponents.
Hey, Elaine, you want to see some more?
Want to see another one?
Oh, yeah, yeah, come on.
Okay, this is a classic.
This is called "Man in Glass Cubicle".
Okay?
When did they put that in here?
No, no, no.
Jim, uh, this is pantomime.
It's just an exercise from Bobby's acting class.
Oh I see.
Can he hear us in there?
Ignatowski, why don't you try renting out that vacant lot between your ears?
Okeydoke.
M-Mrs. McKenzie.
Don't you look lovely today?
Thank you, Louie.
Eh thank you.
Thank you for coming into the garage and brightening up my day.
Is my husband in?
Uh Mr. McKenzie?
Uh, no, no, no.
I'm afraid, I'm afraid that you, uh, you just missed him.
Uh, as a matter of fact, he just left here with a couple of business associates Louie, if I find out that you're lying I'm gonna roll up your tongue and stick a toothpick through it.
: What was the question again?
Is my husband in?
Oh, your husband's in.
Yeah!
I-I-I-I lost my head.
Uh, would you like me to call him and tell him you're coming up?
No.
I want to surprise him.
See, if he knew I was here, that bloated gasbag would be escaping out the back window.
Well-well, I think I speak for the rest of us when I say I hope that you and that bloated gasbag patch up that little tiff you're having.
Ooh, ha-ha!
Ooh, boy!
What's so funny, Louie?
It's happening again.
"Mrs. McKenzie's revenge".
Oh I picked up a touch of that in Mexico one summer.
Shut up.
Now, listen here.
I'm going to tell you a story that I think you're going to like.
It doesn't happen very often, but every now and then Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie have a fight and they go at it hammer and tong, as you can well imagine.
Well, as soon as it's over, she comes out of that door swoops down here and picks out some poor, unsuspecting cabby and invites him home to dinner.
Oh, my God.
That's the most horrifying story I've ever heard.
Shut up, will you?
All right, it's not dinner that she wants to take him home for.
What she's really interested in is a little mattress magic.
Come on.
Louie, this sounds like one of your little sweaty fantasies.
I mean, why would she pick a cabby?
Well, she wants to humiliate her husband.
And what better way to do that than to fool around with one of his employees?
But wait a minute, you haven't heard the worst part yet.
Once she's done with the poor jerk she goes right to her husband and tells him.
As soon as McKenzie hears about it it's bye-bye to that dumb cabby.
You mean the guy loses his job?
No.
I mean he vanishes.
Like he was never born.
I can't even find his records the next day.
All a guy has to do is turn her down.
No, no, no, no, no.
Not with this dame.
I mean, with her, even if you don't, she tells her husband you did.
Either way, you're history.
I don't believe this, Louie.
Well, you better believe it, Banta, because she always picks the young, good-looking ones.
The way I figure it, either you or Wheeler are doomed.
I'm hoping she notices Wheeler's got the better nose.
You know, Louie, I hate to deprive you of your pleasure, but I'm not buying any of this.
Oh, no?
No.
Well, neither did Curly Melnick.
He scoffed at me, too.
And the last time I saw Curly, he was walking out that door, wearing his best suit on his way to Mrs. McKenzie's.
But don't feel bad.
It must have been worth it, because I hear he died with a smile on what was left of his face.
Elaine, could this be true?
I don't know I don't think so.
Tony, this is Louie talking.
Don't take anything seriously.
Yeah, of course.
Oh, boy, am I tired.
I've never been so tired in all my life.
I just drove a double shift, and I'm dead on my feet.
Hey, Alex would know.
Alex would know about this.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, hey, Alex?
Yo.
Louie's been trying to scare us with some crazy story about Mrs. McKenzie's revenge and Curly Melnick.
Is that true?
MRS.
McKENZIE: We'll just see about that, you wart head!
Uh Mrs. McKenzie?
Would you, uh, like me to introduce you to one of these handsome young gentlemen?
Well, you could tell me one thing, Louie.
What's that?
Well, I'm-I'm planning this little dinner party for two tonight at my place.
Oh, how delightful.
I was wondering, could you come?
Make it about 8:00, okay?
Mrs Wh Why-Why me, Mrs. McKenzie?
Because if my fooling around with somebody halfway decent upsets my husband this'll kill him.
Hello?
No, there's no Sheila here.
You got the wrong number.
What?
Yes, of course it's my number.
There's no Sheila here.
What?
Yes Of course I know Look, I I'm telling you, you got the wrong n There never has been a Sheila here.
Look, I'm very sorry, but I really have to get some sleep.
Look, there doesn't have to be a Sheila hold on.
Hey, Sheila!
: Yeah?
: You want to talk to Joyce?
: Who?
: Joyce.
: Oh, tell her I'm busy.
I can't talk to her : She's busy.
She'll call you later.
Rieger!
Rieger!
Hmm?
Rieger, Rieger!
Rieger, wake up, wake up!
Wake up!
Sheila?
I-I didn't want to I didn't want to wake you with a phone call in the middle of the night, 'cause I know how jarring that can be.
That's very thoughtful.
How did you get in?
It wasn't easy.
Hmm I-I-I tried to pick the lock, but it was too tough.
Oh, that's nice to know.
So I had to break it.
Mm-hmm.
I-I knew if I knocked, you wouldn't have let me in.
You're right.
Come on, Rieger.
Rieger, look at me.
Look at me, Rieger.
I'm a mess.
You know why I look this way?
Yeah.
Genetics.
No, no.
I've been drinking, Rieger.
Oh, I see.
You know why I've been drinking?
I don't know and I don't care, Louie.
I've been drinking because I'm facing death.
Oh, come on, Louie.
What are you talking about?
Mrs. McKenzie picked me this time.
Now this might be worth waking up for.
Rieger, I'm trapped.
I'm cursed.
I'm doomed.
Oh, come on, Louie.
There must be some mistake.
Why would she pick you?
Come on, admit it-- you're no Curly Melnick.
Then again, neither is he anymore.
Rieger she picked me because she really wants to rub her husband's nose in it this time.
Ah, that's a good choice.
Come on, Rieger, you got to help me.
You got to help me.
All right.
You help everybody else in the garage.
You got to help me.
I know I help everybody else, because they're nice people and deserving of help.
"They're nice people deserving of help".
If I wasn't about to die, I'd be sick.
Rieger!
Mrs. McKenzie wants my goodies.
What am I going to do?
Come on.
Rieger!
Rieger, Rieger, Rieger!
Hmm?
All right, all right.
All right, all right.
All right, all right.
Let's take a look at your problem.
All right.
Great, great.
Let us examine your options.
My options.
Options, yeah!
I love how you do this.
I got it.
What?
What?
You call her up, tell her you're sick, you can't make it.
Genius!
The man is a genius!
No, wait, wait, wait!
That won't work.
She saw you in the pink of health this morning.
She'll never believe it.
Not for a second.
What?
What?
What?
What?
I got it!
Hmm?
What?
What?
You got it?
You jump the gun.
You go to Mr. McKenzie himself, and tell him everything.
That's it!
That is it!
Wait, wait a minute!
That won't work, either.
It won't?
No, he'll kill you right there in his office for telling stories about his wife.
He'd tear me limb from limb.
I don't know Come on, come on, come on, come on Come on.
Come on.
Think.
Think.
Wait a minute!
Whoo!
Why didn't I think of this before?
Why didn't you think of it?
She picked you because you're loathsome and despicable, right?
Right!
So, all we got to do is find someone more loathsome and more despicable.
Ahhhh!
Louie, there is one answer.
What, what, what?
You're a dead man.
No, no.
Rieger, Rieger.
Bye-bye.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
No, no, I'm not finished, Rieger.
Oh, no, no, no.
Louie De Palma is a survivor.
I'm going to come out of this thing, you bet.
Who was it that said, "I shall return"?
Curly Melnick.
Now, look here, Mrs. McKenzie.
I thought about this a lot, and I want to get one thing straight right now.
There is no way in the world that you are going to seduce me.
I want you!
Come in, Louie.
What am I doing?
This is crazy.
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
I I don't think there's any reason for us to beat around the bush.
I mean, there is no chance of anything happening between you and I. I mean, look at it from my side.
I have nothing but loyalty for my employer, Mr. McKenzie, who happens to be one of the finest human beings who it has been my pleasure to meet in this life.
He can't stand the sight of you.
Then I'll have his woman.
This is crazy, no!
Mrs. McKenzie, you don't want me.
Oh, yes, I do.
Oh, no, no.
No, listen, you only picked me because I was at the bottom of the barrel.
Oh, Louie, that's not true.
No, I-I find you very attractive.
You do?
Yes.
Well what do you find attractive about me?
Your eyes.
You have nice eyes.
Both of them?
: No, Mrs. McKenzie.
There is no way that your mere kisses are going to sway me.
What is that scent?
That's "Pleasuree".
Pl Pleasuree.
It's very expensive.
Oh, it should be.
Poor people shouldn't smell like that.
Let's go into the bedroom.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, Mrs. McKenzie, please.
Please don't make me go in there, please.
Please Louie Please Your palms are getting little sweat marks all over my gown.
Are you going to come into the bedroom with me?
No, no, no.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho-ho, no!
Oh, no.
You don't get me in there.
No, sirree.
Oh, no.
Because I know if I stay out here, I'm safe.
Once I get in there, I'm a dead man.
: Uh-uh  Sure.
Sure, you're an attractive woman.
And, uh especially now.
Lying there posed so seductively with that "come hither" look.
But I'm not coming hither.
No, thank you, Mrs. McKenzie.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Okay, Louie, if that's how you feel.
I've reconsidered.
Oh, good.
Whoa!
What a bed!
Whoo!
If we lose each other, I'll meet you at the headboard.
: No, no, no, no, no No, we mustn't do this.
What?
No.
No, we mustn't.
Why not?
We'll regret it.
No, we won't.
It's morally wrong.
Moral You're a married woman.
We can't do this, Mrs. McKenzie.
Oh, yes, we can.
No, no, I have a war wound.
What?
I have a war wound.
Really?
Yes.
What war?
What are you talking about?
What war?
Yeah.
I can't remember.
I had my memory shot off.
Uh, really, I-I sense the animal in you.
Come on.
MR.
McKENZIE: Ruth!
Is that Mr?
Is that Mr?
That's Mr. McKenzie!
Mr. McKenzie!
Where are ya?
Just a minute!
Just a minute!
MR.
McKENZIE: Where are you?
Where, where?
Hide!
What?
Hide!
Where, where?
I don't know.
You hide.
Where?
Where to hide?
Where to hide?
Where?
!
I couldn't get a plane off, 'cause there was a fog.
I've got the worst headache I ever had in my life.
Now, I'm going to go and get some aspirin.
Would you like something to eat or something?
MR.
McKENZIE: No, no.
No, thanks.
How about a drink?
Oh, no, no.
I had something at the airport.
How about a tuna?
I-I got some tuna.
You want you want some tuna?
Now, you know I don't like tuna.
You don't like tuna?
Isn't there isn't there anything I can get for you?
Oh, my God.
All I want to do is go to bed.
Ruth   Ruth, I-I got a confession to make.
Yeah?
The reason I came back was I just couldn't leave town after that argument we had this morning.
I know, I know.
I'm really sorry about that.
I know, and if you're sorry, I'm sorry.
Let's just kiss and make up.
Oh Hey, hey Remember the last time we kissed and made up like this?
It took us three whole days.
Here you go, Jeff.
Hey, where's Louie?
I don't know, man.
I haven't seen him in three days.
No kidding.
Well, there's a lot of things going around.
He's probably stuck in bed.
Yeah.
Hey, Bobby, you want to go have a drink at Mario's?
Uh, no, man, I got a mime class.
I've got to practice some exercises.
I'll see you later, okay?
Catch you later.
Okay.
Oh, wait a minute.
Huh!
I see what's going on here.
This is mime stuff, right?
Hey!
Right, Jim.
I may be slow, but once I catch it, it sticks.
Well, see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Bobby, when the hell are you going to get this thing out of here?
Uh, I got some people coming to pick it up in the morning, Jim.
Yeah, it's getting to be an eyesore.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
May I have your attention, please?
God knows, I hate to interrupt the important conversations I know you're all having, but someone special is retiring today after 41 years with Sunshine Cabs.
These are the last receipts that will ever be turned in by our old friend Maxie What is that, "Mulch"?
Mulcher?
Melcher.
Terrible handwriting.
Nerves go first, huh, Maxie?
Anyway, it's customary, when a person retires to present them with a little gift to help them keep track of the time.
So here you are, Maxie, a lovely calendar depicting of American highways.
Use it in good health.
Thank you.
You know, a lot of you Rodriguez, 993.
Murphy Louie Beat it, Max.
Look, uh, Jeff, if anybody wants me, I'll be in the library.
Just act natural and don't make a fuss over this.
Over a briefcase?
This isn't any briefcase, Elaine.
I was cruising the Broadway District, like I do on Thursdays, you know, hoping to make a contact.
The guy I picked up left this in the back of the cab, right?
And I was thinking that maybe there's a chance this guy might be important in the theater, you know?
Oh, and he's going to owe you a favor for returning this, right?
Hey, Elaine, you know, there are a lot of ways to make it in the theater, and if being nice is one of them, I'm willing to give it a shot.
Beautiful thought, Bob.
Beautifully put.
Thanks.
Hey, what's up?
Shh.
I don't want Louie to know about this.
I found it in the back of my cab.
You have that, too, huh?
I'm always finding stuff people leave behind-- old magazines, gloves, meat Meat?
Not good meat-- chewy.
Oh.
Jim, sit down.
Anyway, if I'm going to return this I got to get it unlocked to find out who it belongs to, but I've been trying, and I can't do it.
I thought the rule was, anything you find in a cab, you got to turn in to Louie.
Anything that goes into Louie's cage vanishes from the face of the earth.
Yes, with the definite exception of Louie himself.
Hey, you know what?
There are initials on this-- N.Z. Norman Zelnick!
My God.
Who's Norman Zelnick?
I was hoping one of you would know.
Geeze.
All right, so I guess we're just gonna have to bust it open, huh?
No, no, no, Tony.
I don't want to ruin the case.
Ooh Latka's a mechanic.
He's got to have something that can open this.
Yeah, that's right.
Latka, come here.
What?
Take a look at this case.
You think you can open it?
Oh, sure, I can.
I have just the right tool.
Give him a chance, give him a chance.
Latka!
What the hell is this, Iwo Jima?
What's going on here?
Louie, Louie, I found this briefcase in the back of my cab and you're not getting it.
Well, why don't you open it and find out whose it is?
Oh, you think it's that easy, huh?
Well, I've been trying, I been trying and I can't do it.
I'll open it for you.
Yeah, what makes you think you can open it?
Ten bucks, Wheeler.
All right, ten bucks.
Easy to come by.
Do your worst.
Pleasure doing business with you.
All right.
Come on, come on.
Okay, okay you ain't getting anything that's in there, Louie.
What?
What?
What?
What?
Come on, now, you got your money.
Now, get out of here.
Go!
Shoo!
Shoo!
Scram, mush, mush!
All right!
Okay!
Calm down!
Calm down!
I can't.
You can't what?
I got I got to have something out of that briefcase.
Louie I got I got to, please!
Louie, you get out of here, Louie No, I mean it, Wheeler, I mean it.
Get out of here.
Uh, Bob, I think he's serious.
He needs this.
He's not like us.
Just anything, Wheeler, anything.
Anything.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Okay.
Huh?
Oh!
A pen!
Good.
Good.
Hey, Iggy!
Look, I got a pen.
Eh Yeah.
Good, good.
I've never seen a human being experience such joy.
A human being couldn't.
Looks like the guy who owns this is a pretty rich dude.
Hey  I may have hit the jackpot.
I don't know who this guy is.
Let's see.
But he's got a picture of Stephen Sondheim.
Oh, let me see.
That's Stephen Sondheim?
Yeah, the guy on the left.
I don't recognize the other guy.
Maybe that's Norman Zelnick.
Hmm.
There isn't any Norman Zelnick.
Wait, Bobby.
I've heard that name before.
Oh, my gosh!
Look at this!
It's a picture of Paul Newman!
Hey, yeah, and the guy up here is the same guy as the picture down here.
Whose briefcase this must be.
This is fun.
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What are we doing here?
Are we trying to find out the name of the guy who owns this, so we can give it back to him or are we just snooping through his briefcase?
We're just snooping through his briefcase.
And loving every minute of it.
Whoa, look what I got here-- his appointment book.
All right!
Ooh!
Oh, wow, look at that.
"Tuesday, lunch, L. Strasberg".
That's Lee Strasberg.
"Wednesday, lunch, Liza".
Minnelli.
Doesn't say.
Got to be.
Wow, he's having lunch with somebody famous every day this week.
: Oh, look at this.
He knows Cary Grant-- an autographed picture.
Oh, wow.
Who do you figure this guy is?
I don't know.
Maybe he's an agent, maybe a producer.
Or maybe a real estate salesman.
"Neal Zacherman".
Uh-huh.
"Zacherman Real Estate".
He sells real estate.
Well What's he doing with all these pictures of celebrities?
I don't know.
He must, uh, specialize in famous people.
Sorry, Bobby.
Well, what's he doing the rest of the week, Elaine?
I don't know.
I'm starting to feel real funny about looking through this.
Ah I mean, it is private property, you know?
Aah So one more.
Okay.
All right.
"Woody's costume party, Saturday night".
That's it.
That's it.
That's one of Woody Allen's famous parties.
He throws them once a year.
It's a tradition All the biggest celebrities in the world show up there.
Yeah, biggies, like Neal Zacherman, hmm?
No, no, Alex.
Nah Really big stars, too.
I didn't read about it in the paper.
Well, it's not in the papers.
It's a secret.
He wants to keep out the crashers.
Oh!
You know, except for the people who are invited to this party, I mean, we may be the only ones who know about it.
That's very likely.
Yeah.
Scarlett O'Hara.
I'll be Cyrano.
Yeah!
Let's do it.
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
Alex, this is perfect.
What's perfect?
It's a costume party.
Nobody's going to know who anyone is.
It'll be great.
Yes!
Yes!
If you get caught, you're gonna look foolish.
It's worth the risk.
Aw, hey, come on, Alex?
Come on, Alex.
Yeah!
Huh?
This could really help my career.
I mean, this place is going to be contact city.
Yeah!
Listen, if it's so important to you, go ahead.
What do you need me for?
Well, if you go, that means it's not so nuts.
So, the only way you're not gonna look as crazy as you are is if I look as crazy as you are?
I think so.
Well, as persuasive as that argument is, I don't want to go.
Oh, come on!
I mean, what am I going to wear?
I'll fix you a costume.
Yeah!
Oh, come on.
Hey, Elaine, would you fix one for me, too?
Sure.
And me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll fix you all three up.
Come on, Alex, what do you say?
Come on, Alex.
Would you go?
It's ridiculous.
Oh!
You're a drip.
Oh, you mean, if I go to this one party it's gonna save me from Dripdom?
That's right.
Yeah.
What do you say?
Come on.
What do I say?
Come on!
I'll tell you what I say.
I say, let's go to Woody's.
Let's go to Woody's!
Let's go to Woody's!
Let's go to Woody's!
Let's go to Woody's!
Come on!
Let's go to Woody's!
Let's go to Woody's!
Let's go to Woody's!
Let's go to Woody's!
What's the matter?
Louie in the name of God, you're not thinking of going to this thing, are you?
You're gonna ruin it for all of us, Louie.
Of course, I'm going to this thing!
I'm going to meet a few celebrities.
Ah, no, you're not.
I'll get some free food take home a couple of autographs with my new pen.
Aw, thanks, Louie.
Thanks.
Bye.
Sounds like my kind of evening.
Hey, wait a minute.
What are we worried about?
Louie doesn't know where the party is.
The location is right here in the book, right?
Oh Which is now in the briefcase back on its way to its owner, so if nobody tells Louie where the party is, that means Louie can't go to the party.
TONY : That's right.
Too bad, Lou.
Yeah.
We'll tell you all about it afterwards.
Right.
Bye-bye, Lou.
I'll give your regards to Woody.
Bye-bye, Louie.
We're going to Woody's.
We're going to Woody's  I don't believe it.
We just walked straight in.
I'm so nervous, I can't breathe.
Okay, now just relax.
The worst is over.
We're in.
Isn't this incredible?
What a great place to have a party, on a boat.
I know!
Only Woody Allen would think of this.
Hey, you don't mind, I'm just going to go and mingle a little bit, you know?
Oh, no, no, no.
Me, too.
Kind of feel out the territory, you know.
Just act unimpressed.
That's impossible.
Hey.
It's the Andrews Sisters.
: Hey.
You guys look great.
How'd you know it was us?
Just a wild guess.
You know, when-when Elaine told us about these costumes uh, Alex, he thought it was going to look stupid.
Well, I'm not too big a man to admit that I was right.
Look at this party.
Ain't it worth it?
Huh?
It is fabulous.
And wait till you taste the food.
It's great!
And they got one of the best bands playing in there I've ever heard.
Well, I have to admit, it's a long way from beer and pretzels  Oh, my God!
They hit Pearl Harbor again?
Wait a minute.
I know who you are.
Latka Uh, Tony and Barbra Streisand.
No, Jim, this is a costume party, remember?
You were supposed to wear an outfit.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I look wigged out, huh?
So come on, tell me.
Who's famous here?
Oh, everybody, man.
Before you guys came in, I heard some people talking.
And they had to be Diane Keaton and Truman Capote.
Nah Man, this is just too good to stand here.
I got to mingle.
Me, too.
Point me to the starlets.
Uh, shall we, Laverne?
Okay, Maxine.
Hey.
Hey, uh, Patty?
Come on, I'll get you a drink.
I couldn't help myself.
What are those?
Oh, they're Dramamine.
See, I get a little seasickness on boats.
This boat is tied to the pier, Bob.
Yeah-yeah, I know, but it's the motion that gets to me.
Oh.
What are you taking there, Bobby?
Oh, these are for seasickness.
You want one?
No, thanks.
I'm already a little seasick.
But don't go away.
It might wear off.
Oh, Alex, I just came by to tell you I'm having such a terrific time and that your seams are crooked.
Huh?
Oh.
How's that?
Much better.
Alex.
Huh?
Whoo!
Elaine, why are you in such a hurry?
Oh, uh, well, I-I met this guy, and we're dancing.
Hey, hey, Elaine, Elaine who-who is this guy?
Do-Do you think he might be somebody famous?
Oh, Bobby, I don't want to tell you.
'Cause you're gonna think I'm crazy, but he's Al Pacino.
Well, I mean, his name is Al, right?
And I've seen all of Pacino's movies, and the voice could be his.
Oh, boy, Elaine.
We're a little star-struck, are we?
Well, just Hey, uh, can I meet him?
Sure.
Come on.
Oh, good.
Whoa!
You again.
Everywhere I go, he's there.
What a party!
Huh?
You'll never guess who's here.
He's headed this way.
Who?
That's Henry Kissinger.
You can't miss that voice.
: The Lone Ranger?
Wow.
He's a great man, Tony.
I know.
I'm really getting impressed now.
That guy was the Secretary of State.
He won the Nobel Peace Prize.
I've heard he was always good to Tonto.
I was getting to that, Jim.
Alex!
Tony!
Yeah.
Hey, Bob.
Hey, Bobby, what's the matter?
I just found out Hal Prince is at this party.
Who's Hal Prince?
He's one of the biggest directors on Broadway, Tony.
Are you sure it's him?
Oh, yeah.
I overheard this girl talking to a walrus, and she called him Mr. Prince.
Oh, Alex, how can I meet him?
You could take him a fish.
Bobby, he doesn't know you're not supposed to be here.
Just go up to him and introduce yourself and have a little chat.
Hey.
Casually.
Hey, that's really good, Alex.
So Just-just go up to him : and introduce myself and talk to him casually.
Hey, that's really great.
Hey, Alex, you just been standing around.
I mean, come on.
Let's mix.
Let's rub elbows with the biggies.
I don't know, Tony.
What, Alex?
What's wrong?
I've been wondering about something.
I mean, why is it we have this group of people that we set off from ourselves?
You know, we call them famous people.
We treat them better, we treat them special.
We get excited when we're in the same room with them.
What makes them so special?
I know exactly what you're saying, Alex.
And I bet there's plenty of famous people that nobody even knows about.
We have to talk like this more often, Tony.
Hey, Bobby, did you meet Hal Prince?
Oh, yeah, kind of.
I threw up on him.
Might have given "Hi.
Nice party" a try first, Bob.
I'm never going to work in show business again.
Oh, I feel like going home.
Bobby, what did you do to that walrus?
Look, everybody.
Look what I got.
Look here.
What do you got there, Latka?
I got autographs.
What?
Autographs.
Latka, that's the worst possible thing you could do.
Celebrities don't ask other celebrities for their autographs.
Bobby, that's okay.
Take it easy.
Elaine, do you realize what this means?
Hal Prince is going to find out that the guy that threw up on him snuck in here to do it.
I don't care what you say.
You can yell at me all you want, but I got the autographs from famous people.
Yeah, well, who'd you get, Latka?
Well Look.
First first here is George Hanson.
It says, "Best wishes to my buddy, Latka".
And next here is, uh "Nice costume, Latka".
Signed is signed by Fran Petricini.
"Here's looking at you, Latka.
Gus Bates".
Who are these people?
Well, there is Gus Bates over there in the Lone Ranger outfit.
You know, suddenly, I'm not so sure we are where we think we are.
Boy, I know that feeling.
This explains something I heard earlier.
I heard somebody said that they were in the Pacific with this guy Woody during World War II.
I figured they meant he was entertaining the troops.
Woody Allen would have been about four years old in World War II.
I didn't know when he got started in show business.
So, who are these people, then?
Friends of Neal Zacherman's.
Yeah, probably a bunch of real estate people.
Mm-hmm.
That means I didn't throw up on Hal Prince.
You're still young.
Come on, let's get out of this place.
Come on, let's go have a beer.
Yeah.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah, let's go.
Come on.
That's a good idea.
Where's the nearest U.S.O.?
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What?
Wait a minute.
We're crazy, huh?
What's the big deal?
A moment ago, we were having the greatest party of our life because we, uh, thought we were among celebrities.
So what if they're not celebrities?
!
They still could be interesting people, can't they?
I'm going to get to know, uh, Gus Bates.
Hi.
I'm Alex Rieger.
I'm Gus Bates.
Wait up, you guys!
Oh, we're almost home.
What a depressing night.
You're telling me.
Aw, come on, Elaine.
Hey!
You know, I mean, you might have lost Rhett, you might have lost Al Pacino, but you still got Patty Maxine And Laverne.
Hit it, girls.
* Bei mir bist du schon * * Please let me explain * "Bei mir bist du schon" means that you're grand * * Bei mir bist du schon * * Again I'll explain * It means you're the fairest in the land * * I could say "bella, bella" * * Even say "wunderbar" * * Each language only helps me tell you * * How grand you are * I tried to explain * Bei mir bist du schon * * So kiss me and say you'll understand.
*   Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}

Oh, my God!
It's amazing!
After all these years.
You know, I have thought of you now and then trying to think what you might be doing.
Oh, how close did you come to this?
Not very.
I must say, I was a little startled to see our homecoming queen driving a cab.
Uh, Mary, uh, I wasn't the homecoming queen.
Oh, who was?
You were.
That's right.
Weren't you something, Elaine?
Oh, yes!
I was, uh, head cheerleader.
Oh, that's right.
And the lead in the senior class play.
Oh, that's right.
Mm-hmm.
I remember-- I wasn't able to be in the senior class play because I was too busy dating.
Oh, Elaine, we've got a lot of catching up to do.
Oh, yeah.
Tell me about yourself.
Oh, no, no, no.
You go first.
Okay.
I, uh, own a advertising agency.
Mm!
I own a co-op in Manhattan.
I take a month or so in Europe every year.
Oh, and I have a steady fella.
He's an international lawyer and we're really excited, because right now, we're planning a trip for next spring to China.
: Oh!
Maybe I should have gone first.
Well, uh, besides this, I am a receptionist at an uptown art gallery Mm-hmm.
and, uh, I'm a divorced mother of two beautiful children Mm-hmm.
and I, uh, uh That's it.
Well regardless, you certainly look nice.
Uh, Mary, you don't have to feel sorry for me.
Sorry for you?
!
Because there's no reason to.
Well, I know that.
Because I'm very happy.
Oh, you certainly seem very happy.
Yes, well, I'm even happier than I seem!
Happier!
Because, uh, you see, I have a steady guy too.
Oh, great.
Yeah.
What's his name?
Uh it's, uh Billboard.
Bill Board.
Bill Board.
Well, tell me about him, Elaine.
What does he do?
Uh, he's a professor at Columbia.
Oh?
Must be brilliant.
He is, and not at all stuffy.
He's, uh, he's charming and witty, and, uh, he's also the most romantic man in the world.
Oh, he sounds wonderful.
He is.
Oh, I have an idea.
Why don't we all get together for dinner tomorrow night, the four of us.
Oh-oh-oh, no, Mary.
Uh, we're all tied up till the weekend.
Oh, I see, well, perhaps another time.
We'll play it by ear.
Right.
I would love to meet your man.
Me too.
Hey, Elaine.
Hey.
Hey, Elaine, how you doing?
Don't talk to me.
I hate everything today.
I mean, look at me.
I'm a mess.
Oh, yeah.
I hardly even know you.
You know, I was so depressed when I woke up this morning, that I barely made it in here.
I mean, I didn't feel like doing anything.
I swear to God, I didn't even floss.
Come on, Elaine, we're just kidding.
Hey, come on, Elaine.
Now, what got you so down, huh?
Oh, I don't know.
It all started last night when I picked up Mary Parker in my cab.
Who's Mary Parker?
Does she, have, uh frizzy blonde hair, granny glasses and smoke French cigarettes?
No.
Well, if you run into somebody like that, I'd like to meet her.
Mary Parker is this girl I went to high school with you know, that I haven't seen for a long time.
Well, she's beautiful, she's rich, she's successful, she's dating this great guy.
So, here we were, sitting in my cab-- right?
--talking about our lives, and, uh, she has all this and the most exciting thing that's happened to me is I bought this new cushion that keeps me from sticking to the seat.
Hey, you know, Elaine, when you're a cab driver, you know, it's a little natural to occasionally run into someone who's better off than you are.
Yeah, well People you run over are better off than you.
See, you don't understand.
What don't we under What are you talking about, Elaine?
See, this isn't just somebody.
I mean, this Mary and I were real competitors in high school.
Where can I get one of those?
One of those what?
One of those things to keep you from sticking to your seat.
I'll get you one, okay?
Thanks.
Anyway seeing Mary again just reminded me that I that I once expected more from myself, you know?
See I never told you guys this before, but, in the yearbook, I was voted "Most Likely to Succeed".
You know, uh I was voted "Most Talented".
What obedience school was that, Bobby?
While we're patting ourselves on the backs here, I had perfect attendance my junior year and I was elected president of the biology club.
That's because you could take your brains out and pass 'em around the room.
Blue.
Blue?
I'd like a blue thing to keep me from sticking.
It's my favorite color.
Right, Jim, right.
Blue.
Hey, Elaine, Elaine.
Come on, Elaine.
Look at me, look at me, look at me.
Now, come on.
Cheer up, huh?
Now, wait a minute.
Just a minute.
There's only is one thing you need in life and to make make you happy, and that is friends.
That's all you need is friends, and then you be happy.
Right, Latka.
If you have friends, you be happy happy happy person.
You-you also need the food and clothes.
You need, you need food and clothes and you need the friends and the food and clothes, then you be happy person.
Thank you.
And a nice car.
So, if you have friends and the food and clothes and the nice car, it is all you need.
You don't need anything else.
Except a home.
You need the home.
A nice house, and when your friends come over to visit you, they might want to take a dip, so you need the pool.
So, let's add this up: You need the friends and the food and clothes and the car and the house with the pool.
And a beautiful woman, uh, who have a nice body that make you, uh, foam, foaming at the mouth.
And she will sit by the pool in the bathing suit.
That's all, you don't need anything else.
You need the friends the food and the clothes, the car, the house with the pool, the beautiful woman that make the the foam come out of the mouth You know, as long as you have the house with the pool, the car and the beautiful woman the friends would only get in the way.
Forget I said anything.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
Elaine, Elaine See, see, I just can't figure this out.
I mean, it doesn't add up.
Why should all this great stuff happen to Mary Parker?
I mean, I'm a nice person.
I work hard.
Where's my reward?
Elaine, Elaine, you're not going to let this get you down like this, are you?
Oh, I'm trying not to, Alex, but Well, the worst part of it is that Mary felt sorry for me.
Oh, she she tried to deny it, but I know she did.
Well, I couldn't stand that, so, uh, I started lying.
Lying?
!
What'd you lie about?
Well, I couldn't lie about my job, so, uh I lied about having this great steady guy.
Oh She kept pressuring me to get together, so she could meet him.
Ew But I really, really had to squirm to get out of it.
Alex, I don't believe it.
I'm ashamed of my own life.
Sunshine Cab Co. Who?
Yeah, she's here.
Who may I say is calling?
Oh.
Hey, Elaine, it's that Mary Parker.
You know, the woman whose life is so much better than yours.
: Hi!
Yeah.
Uh, it was great seeing you last night, too, Mar.
Oh, yeah, it's a shame, I know, but we're all tied up through the weekend.
Uh, next week?
Uh, no.
Next week, we're going out of town for the whole week.
Oh, yeah, and the week after Uh Mary I have a little confession to make.
Um No, no, no, just give me a chance to say this 'cause it's kind of hard.
I Hello, Mary, uh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I'd just like to say hello.
Hello.
Oh, who am I?
I'm Elaine's guy.
What do you say?
You want to get together?
How about Saturday night?
Fine.
Great.
It will be a pleasure.
Okay.
Can't wait for it.
Bye.
Hmm?
Alex, I appreciate what you're trying to do but you don't know what you got yourself into.
Alex, that was great.
You really think so?
Yeah.
Now if they can just invent something to keep me from sticking to my shorts.
Bill Board?
Hey, you came this close to being Karmen Ghia.
Look, the important thing is that we just relax and have a good time, right?
And that we're not pitied.
Elaine, damn it.
I don't want to hear any more talk like that.
Now, no one's going to pity you tonight.
Okay.
You told your friend Mary that you had a guy that was crazy about you?
You're going to have a guy who's crazy about you-- who will worship the ground you walk on.
Okay.
May I have a glass of water?
What's the matter?
Your arm's broken?
All right, all right, all right.
Hello.
Mary!
Hi.
Mary, this is Bill Board.
Hello.
Bill, this is Mary Parker.
How do you do?
Hi, there.
And this is Michael Edwards.
Hello.
Elaine Nardo and Bill Board.
How do you do?
Hi.
Why don't you two sit down?
Yes, sure.
You look lovely.
OH, thank you.
MAITRE D': Would you care for cocktails?
Uh, martini up, please.
That sounds good.
Bill, why don't you order for us.
All right.
I think we'll start with a bottle of your finest champagne.
Yes, sir.
It's kind of an anniversary for us.
It was nighttime when we met.
Same.
That's sweet.
That's a very unusual name-- Bill Board.
Yeah.
I'm sure you get a lot of kidding.
Well, I don't have as much trouble as my two brothers: Clip and Switch.
Madame, sir.
Our very finest.
Thank you.
Oh, remember, darling?
Thank you.
Well Well Here's to old friends.
And to new ones.
And to Elaine.
Good martini.
Not bad.
But you know where they make the best martinis in the world?
This little bar in Hong Kong called Cecil's.
Have you ever been there?
No.
We don't really travel very much.
Oh, we do.
Well, you know, as a matter of fact, uh, we don't really need to go places.
I mean, we have our entire world right here in New York City.
I mean, we have each other.
Well, we don't travel as much as we used to.
A cab driver and a college professor.
How did you two meet?
How did we meet?
Well, uh Yes, well, you know, actually, it's a very interesting story.
Well, actually, I was browsing in the Metropolitan Museum of Art one day and, uh, I came upon the most exquisite work of art I've ever seen in my life.
I mean, I couldn't take my eyes off her.
I just stood there, stunned.
By the time I was able to speak, well, it was too late.
She vanished.
So, I went home and tried to forget her but I just couldn't get her out of my mind.
So I found myself, the next Saturday afternoon, right back there at the museum.
I started spending all of my spare time in museums all over the city, just on the one chance in a million that I would get to see her again.
How long did this go on?
What?
How long did this go on?
Oh, two, three years.
Three years?
Yeah.
Time had lost all meaning.
And then, one day-- I remember, it was a Thursday-- I'd spent the entire day at the museum and I decided, oh, well, that's it.
It had been a dream.
I imagined the whole thing.
So I went out to the street and I remember it was raining.
I hailed a cab.
And guess who was driving that cab.
Me?
That's incredible.
So I finally got the opportunity to say what I'd been waiting to say for three years-- that I couldn't live without her.
That's lovely.
Oh, that's lovely.
So, uh, where did you two meet?
We were sunbathing on a beach in the Mediterranean.
Cannes.
I don't think it was Cannes, dear.
Where was it?
It was Nice.
I've never been to Cannes.
Well, dear, it doesn't really matter.
It was a beach, right?
Yes, dear, it was a beach, but  When Elaine and I met, I'd become the perfectly happy man and she's the most wonderful person I've ever met in my life.
And, every day, she makes me more certain of that fact.
Would you like to order now?
Yes.
I'd like one of him.
Bill?
Yes, darling?
Do you think you could let go of my hand, so I could cut my meat?
Oh.
Well, I guess you have to eat.
I'll give it right back.
Promise?
Okay.
We know we're silly, but I don't know whenever we get together, you know, we just have this strange habit of forgetting everybody else in the room.
Uh, so, how do you get along with Elaine's children, Bill?
Oh, I love her children.
I love them.
And Elaine is a wonderful mother.
Surprise, surprise.
You know, as a matter of fact, one of my favorite children's stories is about Elaine's son, Jason.
Do you mind, darling?
No.
Not at all.
Okay.
Um, Elaine had told Jason that God answers all your prayers.
So, one night, before he went to bed, Jason prayed to God and asked for a train set.
Well, the next day, he came to Elaine and he said he'd prayed for a train set and didn't get one.
And Elaine was very worried.
And she said, "I'm sorry, Jason, that God didn't answer your prayers".
And Jason said, "Oh, but he did answer my prayers, Mommy.
He just said no".
That was two or three years ago.
I know, darling.
I didn't remember that story.
How did you remember it?
I remember everything.
Oh, listen.
They're playing our song.
May I have this dance?
Of course.
Would you excuse us?
Excuse us, please.
Would you care to dance?
Why don't we wait until they play our song?
What is our song, dear?
We don't have one.
Boy, we did it.
We did it.
We were wonderful, Elaine, wonderful.
They bought it hook, line, and sinker.
You know, I was a little worried at first that our act wasn't convincing, but boy, I'm telling you, you were something else.
Okay, Alex.
Huh?
Come on.
What do you mean, come on?
What?
Come on, you can admit that it was a little more than an act.
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What are you talking about?
You're not that good an actor.
What?
!
Alex, it's okay.
You can confess that you were a little moved.
Elaine, I hate to disillusion you, but all that drivel I did was for your sake, and your sake only.
Drivel?
!
Oh, Alex, be honest!
What?
Come on!
I saw that look on your face.
I know that that look means you were excited.
Oh..
!
Get out You're crazy!
You were.
I was not!
Alex, you were.
Come on.
How can you stand there and pretend that you didn't feel anything?
How can you lie like that?
Elaine, what are you talking about?
You were crazy about me.
I'm the most exquisite work of art you've ever seen in your life!
Oh, that!
No, I'd say that to anybody!
Oh, Alex, come on.
I've been out with enough men to know that no man can get me excited like that if he's just acting.
When we were kissing, you weren't turned on?
I was playing a part.
Oh, here, I'll show you.
Here, I'll do it again.
See?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Oh, really?
Nothing.
Well I guess I was wrong.
Good night, Alex.
See you.
Good night.
Well, I better go now.
It was nothing.
Nothing.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Set him down here, guys.
Alex, what happened?
Well, he came out and hit you with a left and Then what?
Describe the whole fight to me.
I just did.
Well, I guess my memory's okay then.
Hey, hold up, guys.
Hey, uh, Tony, am I supposed to tip them or something?
I usually don't unless they've been especially nice.
Thank you, guys.
Hey, Tony, you all right?
Yeah.
Hey, Lou, I'm sorry I let you down.
Nah, you did fine.
I had you ahead on points.
The doctor's coming.
Oh, great.
Hi.
Hey, Shotgun.
Hey, man, I'm sorry I couldn't give you a better fight tonight.
Hey, that's okay.
That's okay.
Hey, and I know you trained pretty hard for this fight, but, don't worry, someday, it's gonna come in handy.
Right.
Look, uh yeah, you take care of yourself, right?
Geez, that's class, huh?
Guy comes in to check on me.
Big guy.
Man, I told you this was the wrong locker room.
All right, Tony, here's your money.
All right, Lou.
Yeah, you get, uh, Uh-huh.
Minus, uh my manager's fee, trainer's fee, towel and locker fee, attendant's fee, bandages and tape.
All you get for the fight tonight is $20?
Who else you know rakes in five dollars a second?
Hello, Tony.
Hey, Dr. Webster, how you doing?
Doc, take a look at him, will ya?
I'll be back later.
I'm gonna watch the next fight.
Okay, Tony, sit up here, so I can take a look at you.
All right, Doc.
Headache?
Not bad.
Uh-huh.
Here here, follow this light with your eyes.
Uh-huh.
Tony, what's your record?
I'm about, uh, eight and 24.
How many have you lost by knockout?
Well, it depends what you mean by knockout.
I mean, uh, sometimes I'm just taking a rest, and the ref is counting real fast Come on, Tony.
How about recently?
Uh Three times in the last five fights, Tony?
Yeah.
Hey, Dr. Webster, what's wrong with him?
He leads with his right.
No, I mean his body.
What's wrong with his body?
Well, for one thing, I didn't care for his reaction to the examination I gave him in the ring, after the knockout.
All you did was ask me my name.
Yeah, but you gave me the wrong answer.
But once you told me what it was, I recognized it.
Doc, is he going to be okay or not?
Well, nothing here requires immediate medical attention.
Oh, great.
Thank you.
Tony Tony, listen, uh has any doctor ever advised you to, uh quit boxing?
Yeah, I suppose.
You suppose?
A lot of guys yelled at me to get out of the ring.
Some of them might have been doctors.
Dr. Webster, come on.
There's something on your mind.
Why don't you tell us?
Well, Tony's record worries me.
Hey, look, so I ain't no Rocky Marciano.
Listen, Tony, let me tell you a story.
I mean, there was a fighter here last year-- a middleweight like you, you know.
He lost a lot of fights.
He got knocked out a lot, you know?
I mean, he kept on fighting, even though he kept getting beat every time he walked into the ring.
I'm sorry to say he doesn't fight anymore.
Me too.
I'd like a shot at him.
Tony, he doesn't fight anymore because he can't fight.
He also can't drive, or he can't hold a job.
That's because of the damage that he suffered in the ring.
He never should have been allowed to fight.
Now, Tony, I don't know if you've suffered any damage yet, but I can't take the risk of having the same thing happen to you.
Hey, wait a second.
What are we talking about here, Doc?
Tony I think you should quit fighting.
You come in here, you look at me for ten seconds and you want to end my career.
Tony, you get some damage every time you suffer a knockout.
Big deal.
Fighters get knocked out.
Hey, let me tell you something: I've been knocked out a million times-- I been knocked out more times than I can remember.
Tony, you're not helping your case.
Tony, I'm taking your case to the medical board and see what they have to say about it.
Well, I don't care, 'cause I ain't quitting boxing.
Listen, Ma, I'm serious about this.
At a certain age, you don't care about birthdays anymore.
Please, no cake, no presents, no dinner, no nothing.
All right, all right, if you insist.
* Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday to you * * Happy birthday, crazy lady * Happy birthday to you.
Hey, I may get you Would you say that I look frumpy today?
Well Uh uh  No, no, no, I'm trying to look frumpy.
Oh, well, you've done it.
Quite frumpy.
Yeah, well, I just got so sick of guys hitting on me while I'm driving, so I figured if I dressed like this, they'd stop doing it.
Did it work?
No.
I just get hit on by a crummier class of creeps.
Hey, foxy lady.
I see exactly what you mean.
I got it.
I'm coming.
Hello there.
Have a nice day.
This is Jim Ignatowski of the Sunshine Cab Company, where courtesy is our motto and service is our business.
Oh, we're open 24 hours a day with radio-dispatched cars.
Ask for our excursion fares and always exit on the curb side.
Thank you very much.
Hey, Jim, do you have any idea who that was?
No, but he sure was a good listener.
Somebody else want to get that?
I'm pooped.
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
Got it.
Hello?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Tony!
Tony, it's for you.
It's a Dr. Webster from the boxing commission.
Boom!
All right.
Yeah.
Hey, how you doing, Dr. Webster?
What's that?
I don't understand.
Aw, come on, Dr. Webster, this ain't fair.
They can't do that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for my own good.
Thanks.
I can't believe it.
Tony, what is it?
They just took away my boxing license.
Oh, no!
That's terrible!
Can they do that?
They can do it and they just did it.
They said they don't like the looks of my record.
They're worried about me, 'cause I get knocked out too much.
Is there somebody you can appeal to?
Nobody.
What am I going to do?
I mean boxing's my whole life.
Oh Tony, I got to tell you something.
Um maybe it's the wrong time, and everything, but I'm glad you're getting out of that awful sport.
I hated it when I had to go see you fight.
You did?
Yeah, I did.
I mean, I can tell what a great sport it is.
You know, uh, standing up there in front of a bunch of bums and creeps and drunks, getting your head bashed in.
Oh, the glamour's part of it.
Tony Tony, I wouldn't say this if I didn't know our friendship could take it.
Tony, you're not that good a boxer.
I know that, Bobby.
Well, why do you care then?
Because that doesn't matter to me.
You see, maybe when I first started, you know, I had dreams of getting a title but I gave up on that a long time ago.
I ain't no great fighter.
I can't even say I had one great fight, not even one great round-- but there have been moments.
You see, not a day goes by, I don't think about this fight in Jersey.
During the second round, I threw a three-punch combination-- left, right, left hook.
It was perfect.
I heard the crowd gasp.
For that one second, Tony Banta was as great as Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray or any of them.
I always thought that, maybe, I'd put a few of those moments together someday, and have that great fight.
I mean, when I look back on it, I feel kind of special.
Without it, I'm just a cab driver-- just a lousy cab driver.
Uh, uh, uh, Tony, uh Oh, hey, no offense.
That's all right, Tony.
I'm not really a cab driver.
I'm just waiting for something better to come along you know, like death.
Well, if you guys don't mind, I'm going to tie one on.
I'll go too.
I love Chinese restaurants.
What are you hanging around here for?
Don't you have lives?
Louie, they took away my boxing license.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Tony, no.
That's not fair.
Oh, no.
Hey, Louie, I didn't think you'd take it so hard.
Are you kidding?
I made a fortune betting against you.
You know, that is so typical of you to think only of yourself at a time like this.
Well, for your information, Nardo, I happen to need money right now.
I'm saving up for an operation for my ma.
Oh, Louie, I'm sorry.
I what's wrong?
It's female problems.
She's starting not to look like one.
Hi, Bob.
Hey, Bobby.
Hey, uh how's Tony lately?
I don't know.
I haven't seen much of him.
I guess he wants to work this one out by himself, you know?
Maybe I'm insensitive, but I don't see what the problem is, you know.
I can't imagine missing that sport.
Elaine, boxing is Tony's life.
I mean, it would be like me if I had to give up acting.
But when you act, no one gets brutalized.
Only the playwright and anyone trapped in the theater.
How long have you been waiting for this one, Louie?
Years.
LOU- Hello, Alex.
Hey, Lou-Lou.
Hey, everybody, this is Lou-Lou Pantuso.
He's the guy that bought Tony's contract.
How you doin', Lou.
Hi.
Must have got it in a fire sale.
That and the suit he's wearing.
Does he work in there, or is he just on display?
Ignore him.
Ignore him.
What's up, Lou-Lou?
What's up?
Well, I got to talk to you guys.
What's the problem?
Somebody's got to talk to Tony.
I wasn't going to say anything.
I promised Tony I wouldn't, but I just don't feel right about what's going on.
He's got this idea that he's gonna fight under another name.
What?
!
Yeah, there's this fighter in Jersey who retired, and we bought up his license, and, uh, Tony's gonna fight under his name from now on.
Oh, no I can't believe this!
Hold it, can he get away with this?
Unfortunately, yes.
And the crazy thing is he's gonna fight under the name "Kid Rodriguez".
Kid Rodriguez?
!
Well, that explains his attitude.
That explains why we haven't seen him lately.
That explains his buenos dias yesterday.
Hey, I tried to talk him out of it but he won't listen to me.
So, if he's gonna do it, it's better if I'm with him.
Well, listen, Lou-Lou, I'm glad you came to us first, so we have a chance to talk him out of it before he actually gets a fight.
You got an hour and a half.
He's fighting tonight?
!
Yeah, at Brooklyn Armory, third bout.
Look, he's waiting for me.
I'm gonna go, all right?
We'll see you there!
All right, so what do we do?
Somebody's got to talk to him.
But what do we say?
We got to tell him that, that boxing, it destroys your brain, it damages your nervous system and it leaves you a stumbling, disoriented, pathetic wreck.
And if that's what he wants, there are easier ways of getting there.
Let's go.
Come on.
Come on, let's get out of here.
What's going on here?
Tony's fighting again.
Banta?
My sure thing is back?
The born-again loser?
Hello, Ma?
Great news.
You can have that operation you wanted.
That's right.
You've been called "sir" for the last time.
I want you to hit, and don't get hit.
I want you to keep moving and stick it to him.
Hey!
Aren't you guys ready yet?
Give us a few more minutes, will ya?
Okay, there, you're all taped.
Aw, geez, look at that.
I got to do it all over ag Lou-Lou, you already did it six times.
Now, come on, cut the tape.
Oh, Tony, I can't let anybody see that.
I'll be embarrassed to death!
Cut it, Lou-Lou.
Oh, finally.
We got stuck in traffic.
Yeah.
Hi, Tony.
What are you guys doing here?
Uh, Lou-Lou, can we have a couple of moments alone with Tony, please?
Yeah.
I got a million important details to take care of.
Lou-Lou squealed, huh?
Yes, he did.
He says you're fighting under the name of Kid Rodriguez?
Pretty good name, eh?
Kid Rodriguez.
Yeah.
You're not gonna fight tonight, Tony.
Oh, yes, I am.
No, you're not, 'cause we're going to stop you.
Tony, we decided, we're not leaving this room until we talk you out of this.
That's right, Tony.
This sport is a savage blood battle that no right-thinking person can condone.
It appeals to the worst instincts in men and reduces the dignity of the entire human race.
And, besides, the bull doesn't stand a chance.
Jim, I ain't bullfighting.
All right, Tony.
I'm proud of you.
Let's go, guys.
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim Let me handle this.
I can handle this.
Tony, you're not fighting tonight.
Oh, yes, I am, Bob.
No, you're not fighting tonight, and I'm gonna tell you why you're not fighting tonight.
Because you can't fight if you don't have any trunks to wear.
Anybody see a pair of blue trunks?
I'll pay you $1,000 if you don't hurt my face.
Give me five.
All right!
I mean dollars.
Okay.
I just got real lucky, didn't I?
Yes.
Real lucky.
Come on, guys.
I can't stall anymore.
Promoter says I got to get my fighter in the ring now, or I have to get in there myself.
Okay, look, uh, could you guys give me a moment alone with Tony, please?
Oh, yeah, that's a good i that's a good idea.
Hey, uh, Jim, come on, I'll buy you some popcorn.
Come on.
Okey-doke.
Uh, by the way, Tony, I don't want to criticize the way you dress but if you put on your shoes last, it won't be so hard pulling your pants on over them.
Jim?
Popcorn, popcorn.
Tony, listen to what Alex has to say.
Fighting makes you punchy after awhile.
How many fights has he been in?
Just the one with reality.
Hey, Alex, there's nothing you can say, Alex.
I been over this a lot in my mind.
I been over every argument, so forget it, Alex.
There's nothing you could say.
Tony, I don't want to have a big struggle about this.
Now, I want you to think about your health.
I'm talking about your physical health.
Boxers who take too many blows to the head Guys that are punchy start acting weird.
You don't see me acting weird, do you, Alex?
Gee Me llamo Kid Rodriguez.
Kid Rodriguez, me llamo.
Hola.
Tony, I'm very serious about this!
Hey, look You're not gonna fight tonight!
I'm gonna stop you if I have to use physical force!
Hey, esta loco.
Tony!
Tony, no, I'm serious!
Now, look, the only way you're going to get through this door is through me.
Tony, it's time.
Adios, Alex.
Wait, Tony.
Tony?
!
Tony, wait!
Tony, wait a minute.
Tony, Tony, wait, wait Alex Wait, wait, just a second.
Tony, you're making a big mistake.
Alex, can't this wait?
I'm a little busy right now.
No, no, no, Tony, you're making a big mistake.
Alex, Alex, I want you to have a good seat for Tony's fight, but this is ridiculous.
I mean, it's too late for this argument, Alex.
No, it's not, Lou-Lou!
Ladies and gentlemen, the next event on tonight's card will be a ten-round, middleweight contest between these two scrappy, Latino contenders.
Presenting, in this corner on my left, weighing in at 159 pounds, wearing black trunks, sporting a record of 14 and six, from Los Angeles, California: Alberto "El Gato" Martinez.
Just listen to me for one second.
Alex, it's not polite to talk during the introductions.
Weighing in at 162 pounds You lost weight.
wearing blue trunks with the gold stripes, with a record of 23 and eight You think I'm quitting with a record like that?
originally from Puerto Rico, known as "The Pride of San Juan": Kid Rodriguez.
Tony, there are a lot of other people to think of, you know, in this thing!
Alex, I gotta get my instructions!
Gentlemen Tony, you're you're forgetting your friends.
You know, people who love you who don't want you to fight.
Alex, if they loved me so much, they'd understand how much fighting means to me!
Do you mind if I go on?
In the event of a knockdown No, you don't have to finish, because he's not fighting tonight.
I am too!
No, you're not.
Yes, I am!
No, you're not!
Well, if you do decide to fight, I want a nice clean fight.
I want you to watch your head-butts.
No punches below the belt.
I want the kidney punches, all right?
And, in case of a knockdown, the man scoring the knockdown goes to the farthest corner and stays there until I tell him to come out.
All right, shake hands and good luck to both of you.
Demos buena pelea.
Buena suerte para ti.
Hey, gracias.
La cucaracha, man.
Tony, will you just listen to me for one second?
Just listen to me for one second, okay?
Alex, I know the risks, and I want to take them.
It's my business here.
Tony, I just I, I have one question to ask you-- just one question, then I'll shut up.
All right?
All right, Alex, what?
Okay How would you feel if you hurt a fighter tonight?
Huh?
I mean, if you really seriously hurt that fighter?
I'd feel terrible, Alex, of course I would, but that ain't gonna happen because I ain't that good a boxer, remember?
I mean, if anybody's gonna get hurt, it's gonna be me.
You-- right, you.
How do you think he's gonna feel if you get seriously hurt, huh?
It's gonna be on his conscience for the rest of his life.
Every time you go into the ring, you have two lives that you put on the line.
I need time to think about this one.
You don't have time.
Damn it, Alex, who invited you, anyway?
Hey, Lou-Lou, I'm throwing it in.
LOU- Okay.
Nah.
Hey, Hoss, I decided not to fight.
Let me say it to you in Spanish-- el stopo.
I'm not fighting.
I'm gonna quit.
I want to give it up.
I don't want to do it anymore.
Stop.
I said stop.
El stopo.
Here's the ref.
Maybe you could talk to him Hey, man, I told you I'm not fighting no more.
Some guys.
All right, Tony.
If you leave the ring, you lose by default!
The winner!
Well, now that you've given up boxing, I just wanted to say that, uh we're behind you whatever you want to do.
I know that, Alex.
Thanks.
Okay.
Hey, Al, you know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to get together all the money I made in boxing all these years, buy myself a new suit.
Good idea, Tony.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Here's one.
Driver Where to?
The Plaza Hotel.
The Plaza Hotel Hey, look, I know you may be skeptical I know you may be skeptical, but by the end of the day, you're going to be thanking me.
What's the matter?
The Plaza Hotel Is that in New York?
Uh, I think we should get another cab.
No, no, no, stay right where you are.
I'll fix you up.
Uh, G 7.
Oh Oh, that's not far.
I could drive you over.
Good.
All right.
Now, look, I'm telling you, this man is brilliant.
Every time I go to one of his seminars, I come out feeling high.
Really?
And when I say high, I mean high-- higher than I've ever been on a drug.
All the success I've had in the last four years, I attribute to him and to his theory of dynamic perfection.
Well, everything I've heard, it sounds really great.
I'm telling you, it is the secret to organizing a business, to beating your competitors, to getting somewhere in life-- to happiness.
Well, here we are, gentlemen.
The airport.
You picked us up at the airport.
I thought we got here awfully fast.
Where was it you wanted to go?
The Plaza Hotel.
Plaza Hotel G-7.
G-7.
Hi, Jim.
Boy, what a bunch of losers.
You talking about us, Jim?
I'm talking about you, I'm talking about me, I'm talking about all of us.
But I'm not going to be a failure for long.
I found the secret: dynamic perfectionism.
Well I think the little Dutch boy in Iggy's brain just let the water go.
Hey, hey, Jim, what are you talking about?
Well, I picked up a couple of guys at the airport tonight and finally got them into town.
And while I was driving along, they were talking about this dynamic perfectionism stuff.
I want to tell you, I've learned what separates successful people from people like us.
Barbed wire, if they're smart.
So, uh, what's the big secret, Jim?
Come on, tell us what it is.
Simple.
Uh every one of us has something in this world that we want more than anything else.
Everyone of us has a goal.
This should be good.
What's your goal, Jim?
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, Tony, I can't tell you.
Like the guy said tonight, "Be a doer, not a talker".
Oh.
Oh!
The point is you got to have a goal and go for it.
I have a goal-- something I always wanted and thought was impossible.
Being able to think without moving your lips?
No, no, no.
That's not enough anymore.
My goal is something much bigger than that.
So how do you go about reaching this goal?
The way you go about getting it is to do every little thing in your life the best you can.
If you do everything perfectly, eventually you'll reach your goal.
Therefore, I'm going to do everything perfectly.
I'm going to start at the bottom and do as well as I possibly can the most meaningless, insignificant, mindless acts-- like my job, for instance.
Boss?
How much does a good cab driver make in a night?
What was my best night?
You once broke $12.
Oh.
Boss, I want to drive again.
I want to go right back out there on those streets and drive another shift-- a perfect shift.
I want to be a perfect cab driver.
I want to be perfect.
Well, you're on the right track.
You've already made a perfect ass of yourself.
All right!
Yeah, yes, officer.
It's Sunshine Cab Number 643.
The driver's name is Ignatowski but he'll answer to Waterhead uh Mr. Halloween The Fog or hey, Scuzzo.
Yeah, thanks a lot, all right, yeah.
Hey, Louie, what's wrong?
What's wrong?
I'll tell you what's wrong.
"Mr. Perfection" is still out with that cab so I reported him.
You mean Jim's still out there?
He's been driving for almost 24 hours.
Hey, listen, maybe some of us ought to go out and look for him.
That's a good idea.
Yeah, but where would we start?
I mean, where could he be?
Where would Jim decide to go?
Why don't we try thinking like Jim for a minute, okay?
No, let's not do that anymore.
It hurts.
Yeah.
Jim!
Howdy!
All right!
Jim, where you been?
Jim, where have you been?
I've been out there, working towards my goal.
Ignatowski!
You're fired!
Boss, maybe you should look at my trip sheet!
I don't have to look at anything!
You are unemployed.
Out!
What, are you telling me that I can't fire him?
I only kept him around this long because he's a conversation piece.
Hey, Jim, how come you were gone so long?
I guess I was concentrating so hard on being a great cab driver, I forgot about the time.
Well, that's that.
I guess I'll be moseying along.
Three hundred and seventy-three dollars?
So long, everybody.
Ignatowski!
Yo, boss.
I love you.
A handshake would have done it, boss.
Hi, I'd like to go to Oh, welcome aboard Sunshine Cab number 1-3-4.
My name's Jim Ignatowski and I'll be your driver.
I'd like to go to Carnegie Hall.
Carnegie Hall L-6.
Okeydoke.
Traffic today between here and there should be light to moderate.
We're not expecting any bad weather.
We're traveling now along the Avenue of the Americas, which was formerly known as Sixth Avenue.
Us old-time New Yorkers still like to refer to it as Sixth Avenue.
Old habits die hard.
Speaking of old habits-- on your right, you'll notice a group of nuns going into Radio City Music Hall.
It's By the way, it's a bit nippy out there today.
If you'd like a nice hot cup of java, there is some in that thermos back there.
If you want a sandwich, help yourself.
We got salami, sardine and watercress.
This is the strangest cab ride I've ever had.
Sir, if providing comfort, service and satisfaction to my customers is strange then you can call me a freak.
Thank you.
You're a freak.
Thank you.
Well, here we are.
Watch your step getting out and thank you for riding Sunshine Cabs.
Did I get you here fast enough?
Yeah, it was very quick.
In fact I'm a little early.
I wouldn't mind a cup of coffee.
Why don't you take another trip around the block.
You betcha.
If, uh, you'd like to listen to a little music, there's a stereo-headphone set in the back.
Thank you.
We're featuring a Sinatra retrospective this evening.
That would be very nice.
* If somebody needs you * It's no good unless she needs you * * All the way.
* Doobee doobee doobee doo wa * Hey, here he comes.
Hey Jim!
James!
Hi, boss!
James, my son.
Welcome home.
How'd it go?
Fine, fine, fine.
Yeah?
So how much money did you make, huh?
Approximately.
Come on, come on, tell us.
Fifteen dollars.
Fifteen dollars?
!
I was only kidding, boss.
Ah!
Oh!
That one's on you, boss!
Oh You lug, you.
What a guy, what a witty guy.
I love this man.
Come on, so how much did you make?
How much?
Come on, tell us.
Come on, give, give.
It's a new record.
I want everybody to know that Mr. Mackenzie called me personally, not ten minutes ago, to congratulate me on having the hottest shift in this garage, and I got the franchise right here to thank for it.
You know, Louie, your love for Jim is really touching.
Yeah, Iggy and me are tight.
We're like Roy and Trigger.
Hey, Jim, you're not falling for this, are you?
Uh, I don't know.
Am I, boss?
There's nothing to fall for, Iggy.
Wheeler's just jealous.
But the fact of the matter is there's a structure to cab driving.
It's like it's like a tree of life.
On the very topmost branches you have the Ignatowskis.
Beneath them, you have the Riegers and the Nardos.
Below that, you have your Bantas, apes and gibbons.
Below that, you have your lice, your pond scum your Wheelers.
You can't get lower than Wheelers.
What about me, Louie?
I stand corrected.
All right, enough chitchat.
I'm going to take these totals right up there to Mr. Mackenzie.
Ace Iggy!
Hey, Jim, congratulations.
I really mean it.
Yeah, what you're doing is so incredible.
Hey, we are all really proud of you, man.
Even me, Jim.
Well, it's sort of nice being the best at something in the world, you know what I mean?
I'm sort of sorry to end it.
End it?
!
What do you mean, end it?
What's wrong?
Well, I've got everything now I need to obtain my goal.
You mean you're not going to be a good cab driver anymore?
Oh, that was too much hard work.
I've always liked myself the way I was.
There was just one thing lacking and now I've got it.
What is it?
Yeah, what is that?
I want you to come to my house tomorrow and I'll reveal my goal.
"I want you to come to my house tomorrow night and I'll reveal my goal".
By the way, do you spell your name with one "O" or two?
One.
I'll get it right next time, Booby.
And I got got one here for Latka.
Where's Latka?
Eh, here.
"Dress optional".
He must mean how we dress, not if we dress, right?
No, I don't think so.
Why?
Yours is the only one that says that.
Hey, come on, let's go to Mario's, huh?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
I'll buy you all a drink.
Hey!
Oh, how nice!
Hey, what the hell?
I'm rich.
I'll buy each of you a drink.
Even better!
Hi, Jim.
Hi, everybody.
Can I take your coats?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Yeah, thanks, Jim.
Here.
Thanks a lot.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Thank you.
What do you got under the old blankets here, Jim?
All in good time, Tony.
Come on, we can't wait to see your revelation.
Yeah, yeah, what's the big secret?
Come on.
There came a time in my life when I sensed a certain emptiness-- something missing.
And then I discovered this miracle to fill my life.
Because the truth of the whole world is right here-- the beauty, the ugliness, the folly, the glory, the joy, the heartache, the yin and the yang.
It's all right here under this blanket.
Anybody care to guess what it is?
Latka?
It is a religious statue of some spiritual leader-- maybe one of the prophets?
No, no, no, it's not that.
Oh, then it is booze.
Well wrong again.
Come on, come on, Jim, the suspense is killing us.
Yeah, we're dying to know!
Tell us.
I guess I've all kept you waiting long enough.
Yes.
It's Uh It's been under the blanket so long, I forgot.
Now what are we going to do?
Well, why don't you lift up the blanket and we'll find out?
Good man, Booby.
Okay What in the world?
Television?
Television?
!
You spent all your money on television?
What am I-- nuts?
Oh, yeah, now I remember!
This isn't television, this is television-- A home video center: Wide-screen TV, video tapes, video discs, video computer games, remote control!
I get channels from all over.
I get 24-hours news, I get 24-hour sports.
I get sessions of congress.
I'm on home cinema, I'm on cable.
I'm on satellite.
Jim?
Yes?
Do you mean to say you've been busting your butt, driving 12 hours a day, breaking all kinds of company records, just to buy a television?
Hey, Jim, uh, I don't know, you know?
I expected something more important to come of this.
I mean, this was like a religious thing to you.
Bobby, the whole world comes through these screens.
I watch the great events of this world.
Just this afternoon, I was watching the Delaware legislature debating whether they should call themselves Delawarians or Delawarites.
That's right.
Personally, I'm rooting for the Delawarians, although the Delawarites put up a good argument.
Delawinians didn't stand a chance.
Well, uh, hey, you know, boy, it's really getting late.
I'm going to go get a bite.
Yeah, I'll go with you.
Yeah, good idea.
You're going to be missing a great water polo game.
Water polo?
Uh-huh.
You mean horses swim?
They not only swim, they hold their breath forever.
They play the whole game and never come up for air.
Well, good night, Jim.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.
Thanks.
Yeah, Jim, thank you.
Good night.
Tony, would you catch the light on the way out?
Sure, Jim.
That's Apocalypse Now.
Come sit.
Huh.
That's funny.
And that's Submarine Command with William Bendix.
That's an Islander home game, gee.
I got stations from all over America.
Programs from all over the world-- first-run movies, sporting events and whenever I get bored with something, I just switch channels with this little magic box.
Wow!
Well, if you'll all excuse me, I don't think I'm going to waste my evening watching television.
I mean, Jim, I'm very happy for you, if this is really what you want.
But, you know, there's a whole world out there, and I think I'd rather be out there talking to people, you know, meeting people and having real experiences, instead of sitting here watching a couple of images on television, trying to decide between Delawarians and Delawarites.
OFFICIAL : Attention.
Good night.
Here are the results of the roll call vote.
From this day forward, all citizens of the fair State of Delaware shall be officially known as Delawarians.
What are they, nuts?
Delawarians?
Attention, attention-- attention, Delawarians.
May I have your attention again, please?
Now that that's settled, we'll move on to the next piece of business-- the Jeffers-Wagner Sewage Bill.
This is going to be a dogfight.
Come on, man, put on my hockey game.
That's not hockey.
There we go.
Come on, Islanders, let's go.
Hey, Alex, you know the great thing about television?
If something really important happens anywhere in the world-- night or day-- you can always change the channel.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Hey, Elaine, it still raining out?
No.
They opened a fire hydrant, and I've been playing in it.
Oh.
Avast, you lubbers!
What a beautiful day it is.
It's coming down buckets out there.
The weatherman said it's going to last all day long, ha-ha!
You like the rain, boss?
I love the rain, Iggy!
You know why I love the rain?
No, boss.
Why, boss, why?
I love the rain because when it rains nobody walks.
What is it I always say?
What happens when it showers?
Come on.
Come on.
What happens when it showers?
Big bookings are ours.
And what happens when it rains?
Monetary gains.
This is fun.
What happens when it drizzles?
Shut up, Ignatowski.
What an ear for poetry that man has.
All right, I've got an announcement to make here.
All right, attention.
Listen up, here.
I have a personal announcement to make.
I put my mother in a rest home so I am having a lavish party at my now bachelor pad and none of you cab drivers are invited.
Oh, you're breaking our hearts, Lou.
I'm really sorry that none of you can make it.
What time should I be there, Louie?
Any time you want, Latka.
As soon as you get there I'm throwing your foreign butt down the stairs.
Well, in that case, I might be a little late.
I can't believe it, Louie.
I just can't believe you would celebrate putting your mother in a home.
Hey, Rieger, it's not easy living with your mother all these years.
There's no privacy and every day it's the same thing-- "Louie, eat your dinner".
"Louie, turn down the television".
"Louie, don't use the doilies to clean the beer off your chin".
So what kind of rest home is your mom in?
Got me.
You mean you didn't even take her there?
Well, I-I-I took her there.
Not right to the door, I mean.
You mean you didn't go in and check the place out?
What the hell do I look like, Mike Wallace?
I mean, what's the big deal?
It's a rest home.
All right, all right, now why don't you consumer advocates line up for your cab assignments.
There's a city full of mildewing people out there just dying to snuggle up next to you.
Banta, 599.
Rieger Okay, Lou.
Say sevenish?
What are you talking about?
You know, the-the party.
Dress nice.
What on earth would make me go to a party of yours?
Hold it.
The way I figure it, Rieger, you're the only guy in this garage who won't embarrass me in front of my friends.
Oh.
And-- let me tell you this-- this is going to be a bash.
Huh?
I'm talking about wild.
Let me give you a little tip.
Make sure you don't have any holes in your shorts, if you know what I mean.
You know something, Lou?
I can't believe this, but I'm actually tempted to go to that party.
Mmm I mean, I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's sort of a nagging curiosity in me.
You know that kind of morbid curiosity when you pass a car wreck, you just got to slow down.
Or when you have a sore in your mouth you put your tongue against it so you know it hurts.
Or when you have a container of milk that you know has gone sour.
You just got to smell it before you throw it away.
I can't wait either.
All right.
Here's another one, here's another one.
Orson Welles's necktie.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Oh, it's not the cops.
Hi, Alex.
Hi, Louie.
All right, keep it down, guys.
I got an introduction to make.
Alex, this is Lyle, Huey, and Daytona Dave.
Have a seat, Alex.
I'll get you a brew.
What did I miss?
No, no.
You leave the room, you got to pay the price.
Boy, the stories were just flying around here a minute ago.
Hey, Lyle, tell Alex the one about how you woke up in the morning and your gums were bleeding.
No, no, no, that's okay.
That's okay.
Don't be repetitious on my account.
So how did, uh you guys ever get together?
You know you know how a crowd always gathers around on the street to watch when some guy's had a heart attack?
We were the last ones to leave.
The ties that bind.
Hors d'oeuvres?
Thank you.
Got to go.
Where you going?
We got another party.
Well, listen, I hope they have a couch.
Come on, guys.
The evening's young.
It's the shank of the evening.
It's only 7:30.
Well, if you insist.
Thanks for dropping by.
We ought to do this more often.
Keep smiling.
Boy!
What an evening!
Oh, gosh, it's great to know guys you can get silly with like that.
I'm probably not going to remember any of this in the morning.
Are they the only ones that showed up, Lou?
Well, uh I thought a few more people would come, but um Hey, I know what we need here.
A little music.
Ma's got a ton of records over here.
No, thanks, Lou.
You feel like a little Jerry Vale?
Uh, no.
Thanks, Lou.
I've been listening to him all day.
Well, look, Lou, I really got to go.
So soon?
Yeah.
Come on, stick around for a little bite to eat.
No, that's all right.
Come on.
Here.
Here, I'll heat it up.
No, thanks, Lou.
I'd really better shove off.
How about a little TV?
Come on.
No, no Louie, I don't I don't really want to watch TV.
You don't like being here alone, do you, Louie?
What, are you kidding?
I've been waiting for this all my life, Rieger.
I love being alone.
Louie you miss your mother, don't you?
Get off it, Rieger.
I don't miss her.
I think about her a lot.
Who wouldn't think about her with all the junk she left around here?
Look at this stuff.
Geez!
Look.
This stupid tea cup.
: Her little shawl.
She left her little shoes here.
Look at her little shoes, Alex.
No, no.
One shoe.
Come on.
No.
I'm really sorry I brought her up, Lou.
Yeah.
Well, you're right.
I've been trying to hide it but I admit it.
I miss her.
I wish she was here.
Why don't you call her up?
Tell her to come home.
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
I lied about that, too.
It was her idea to leave.
Oh.
We had that same old argument we always have.
She burned my dinner.
I called her a name, she called me a name and then I hid her teeth.
You hid her teeth?
Yeah.
Next thing I know she's walking out the door saying,  "So long".
She never left me before.
If anybody's going to do any calling it's going to be her because a man never begs.
Ma taught me that.
I lost ma.
Look, Lou, I was thinking about stopping off at Mario's on the way home for a nightcap.
You want to come along?
Look, Rieger, I don't want your pity.
If you're inviting me out like a guy invites his buddy for a drink, that's okay, but if you're doing this out of pity, well, let's forget it.
It's pity, Lou.
Well, a beer's a beer.
Aw, Louie you look terrible.
What are you staring at?
Get your stupid eyes off me.
Hey, Lou you okay?
What, are you kidding, Rieger?
I'm on top of the world, sitting on a rainbow.
You been, uh, spending a lot of time with those friends of yours lately?
No.
Lyle shot Huey.
He shot him?
Yeah.
It was an accident.
He just wounded him.
Oh.
Six times.
Must put a strain on their friendship.
Come on, Rieger, leave me alone, huh?
All right.
All right.
Hi, Latka.
Louie.
Yeah?
It is ten minutes past the hour.
I know.
But that means I am late.
Yeah.
Louie yesterday I snuck out early.
Oh?
Also, I figured out a way of getting coffee from the machine without paying money.
Louie, are you listening to me?
Hey, uh, a nice suit you're wearing.
Maybe it will come back in style.
Is, is, is that a nose, your nose or are you sucking on the banana?
I don't want to say you're ugly, but you know Don't press your luck, Latka.
Okay, Louie.
I'm sorry.
Boy, I was cooking.
Louie's in bad shape.
Listen, you guys, you know, uh his mother is the only friend he has.
Hey, what do you guys say that we invite him for a game of cards?
Are you nuts?
Come on, Bobby, it will help him take his mind off his mother.
I don't want to.
Come on.
Come on, it wouldn't even hurt to just invite him this once.
Okay, okay.
You guys can do what you want, but I'm playing this game under protest.
Hey, Lou Hey, Louie, how would you like to come over and have a game of cards with us, huh?
You want me to play cards with you?
Yeah, yeah.
Look, we're kind of worried about you, Lou, so, uh, come on.
All right.
Sure.
Sure, I'll join you.
Okay.
Look, Lou, do me a favor, would you, and don't mention anything about your mother, okay?
Okay.
She's forgotten.
Come on.
Leave the shoe here, Lou.
All right.
Jeff, you watch the cage for me here.
I'm going to go play cards with the guys.
I was invited.
That's nice, Lou.
Come on, Louie.
And keep your eye on the shoe.
Okay.
I was invited to play cards with the guys.
Congratulations, boss.
Come on, Lou.
Come on, Lou.
Right here, baby.
Best seat, right there.
Five card draw is the game.
Ooh, I love five card draw.
That's my favorite game.
This is going to be fun.
Yeah, that's right.
Jacks or better now.
Okay.
Ante up, everybody-- a nickel.
Oh, good, Bob.
Oh!
I open for a nickel.
All right, I'll see that.
Oh, excuse me, Lou.
I just want to get a cup of coffee.
All right, Alex.
Okay, I see your nickel, and I raise you a nickel.
Ooh!
This is exciting!
I have to get out.
Boy, that's it.
Well, I see you Oh, good.
All right.
Well, I'm in with you.
Okay.
Where are we?
Uh, a nickel to you, Alex.
Who raised Louie?
Who raised Louie?
Ma raised Louie.
That's it.
Ma raised me.
Louie, I want to talk to you.
Louie, I want to talk to you.
Louie, you're becoming a sniveling, weepy obnoxious boob and I'm getting sick of it.
Do you hear me?
Now, look, if you want your mother, go and get your mother, but don't just stand there!
Louie, Louie, come here.
Come here.
I want to show you I want to show you something.
Come here.
I want to show you yourself.
Look in that mirror.
Look at that.
That's you.
Is that me?
Yeah, that's you!
I'm a boob!
That's not me.
That's not the way I handle things.
Oh, yes, it is.
That's me.
That's me.
I'm going to do it.
I'm gonna stand on my feet and fight.
All right.
Get ready, world.
Louie De Palma is back.
Latka, I'm docking you a week's pay.
And nobody ever ask me to play cards again.
Louie De Palma does not play cards with losers.
And, Rieger the next time you lay a hand on me, you're history.
Now, if you'll all excuse me, I'm going to get my mommy.
Ma, it's me, Louie.
Louie?
Yeah.
Ma yeah, I come to take you home.
Look, come on.
Hey, I'm fed up with this nonsense.
You don't belong here.
You belong home with me.
Now come on, open this door.
Open it up or I'm going to break it down.
Oh, yeah?
Well, hum a few bars of this, crazy lady.
What's the matter with you?
You never seen a man visiting his mother before?
Get out of here.
Come on, look.
All right, let's talk this over.
I mean, what's the big deal about the fight we had?
I mean, we always fight.
Called you a bad name?
What bad name did I call you?
It slipped out.
Look look, Ma, come on home.
Come on.
I promise we won't fight anymore.
Ma, when you're not there, it's so quiet I can hear the toilet running.
I'm sorry for getting mushy.
Aw, Ma, what are you talking about I should get married?
I'm not ready to get married.
Besides, who would want to marry me?
Elaine Nardo.
Well, I, I know I told you that she's nuts about me, but but she's a little overeager.
Well, Susan Anton.
You know, well, I haven't closed that door yet.
What am I talking about here?
Ma, I got to be honest with you here.
All those women I'm always telling you about that are after me I'm making that up, Ma.
I'm a lonely man, Ma.
I need you there.
If I come home, will you be nice to me?
For a while.
Okay, Louie, I'll go home.
All right, all right, all right.
Come on, come on.
Ma, you shouldn't be carrying that suitcase with your bad hand.
Here.
Come on, Ma.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Uh, what's the problem?
I can't find an apartment.
I thought you had an apartment.
No, I lost it.
That happens to me all the time.
Sometimes, I can't find mine for days.
Jim, I told you all about this yesterday.
Jim, remember?
They're turning Elaine's apartment house into a co-op.
She can't afford to buy the apartment so she has to look for a new one.
Oh, now I remember.
You did tell me this yesterday.
Hey, good going, Jim.
Did you look over in Brooklyn?
That's usually where mine turns up.
Jim, your apartment is in Brooklyn.
Again?
Hey, come on, Elaine, worst comes to worst, you sleep on my couch for a couple of nights.
Oh, uh, thanks, Alex, but, uh, I've slept on your couch, and it's not that comfortable.
When did you ever sleep on my couch?
The night you showed slides from your ski trip.
Oh, that is an uncomfortable couch.
Well, you could sleep on my couch, Elaine.
Listen, thank you both for your offers, but I don't want to impose on either one of you.
Really, I refuse to stay with you guys.
Hey, Elaine, you got a boyfriend?
I mean, you and Steve are still seeing each other, right?
Oh, yeah.
We're doing great.
Then why don't you sleep on his couch.
No, no, Tony.
It's a little too early in the relationship.
You know?
I don't want to scare him off.
You look that bad in the morning, huh?
Hey, guys, I got it!
I got the job!
All right.
What?
!
Yeah, I can't believe it!
A whole month on tour.
Oh, that's great.
Oh, congratulations.
Oh, thanks, Elaine.
You know, this is what acting is all about-- touring to the people-- people who ordinarily wouldn't be enriched by the catharsis of the classical theater experience.
What play are you doing?
Under the Yum Yum Tree.
I thought that was Desire Under The Yum Yum Tree.
That's another good one, Ton.
Oh, Bobby, does this mean I can have your apartment?
!
Yeah.
I told you if I got the part, you got the apartment.
Oh, great!
A place to stay.
So, Bobby, what are you gonna do to celebrate?
Rub Louie's nose in it.
Uh, hey, Louie, I hate to ruin your day like this, but I just got a real good acting job.
Bobby!
Really?
That's wonderful, that's wonderful!
Hey, I got to announce this.
Wait till everybody hears.
No, Louie, that's not necessary, really.
Are you kidding?
I insist on telling everybody how wrong I was about you.
All right, attention here.
Attention, cabbies.
All right, you all know that Bobby Wheeler has taken a lot of heat from me in the past about his acting career.
I just found out that our Bob has landed the lead in a major New York Broadway production.
Louie, Louie, it's not a Broadway play.
It's a tour.
I'm doing a tour.
Oh.
Correction.
Bob tells me it is a starring role in one of the biggest cross-country tours in the history of the American Theater.
Louie, it's not a cross-country tour.
It's a small tour.
I'm going to three places, you know?
Oh.
Correction once again.
Bobby's got a teensy part with a sleazy company in three trailer parks.
I'm going to kill him, I'm going to kill him!
I don't know, Elaine.
Bobby's been gone about a week, and you've got his apartment looking the best it's ever looked.
Oh, thanks.
It's this old interior decorator trick I learned, called cleaning.
Oh.
Tony.
Stains.
Elaine, the apartment looks great, fantastic.
Oh, I don't know, I guess I did do a little puttering, huh?
Do you think Bobby will mind?
Why don't you ask him?
Hey, Bobby, am I glad to see you.
Hey, how you doing, man?
Eh, it hasn't been the same without you.
Don't seem like you been gone a month.
I've been gone a week.
That feels right.
Hey, well, it doesn't matter that you've only been gone a week.
The point is, you're back.
No, the point is, it's only been a week.
Oh, uh, you know, I got tired of Florida, you know?
You smell something funny?
No.
Neither do I. Is this my apartment?
Hey, I want a glass of wine, too.
Bobby, if you don't want to talk about the Florida thing Hey, what's to talk about?
I left for a month and came back three weeks early, that's all.
Quit the tour, huh?
Yeah, I quit.
Got fired.
We're talking semantics here.
It's all a matter of who says good-bye first, right?
Oh, Bobby.
Why?
What happened?
The whole thing is so unprofessional.
Everybody knows when you go out on these long tours, you know, men and women, close quarters sometimes for months, affairs-- they're inevitable.
I had one with the costume girl.
When?
On the bus ride down to Florida.
You got fired for not waiting till you got there?
I got fired because it turns out that she was the director's daughter.
Oh.
Oh.
I'm surprised you lasted a week in Florida.
I lasted a day in Florida-- I spent three days on the bus ride back.
Meet anyone on that trip?
No, that's all right.
Will you, please?
Oh, what the heck.
It happened, it's over, and I'm home.
And I'm, uh, kind of tired, guys, so, if you don't mind, you know?
Huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We were shoving off anyway.
Come on.
Come on, guys, let's go.
Um, well, Bobby, uh, there may be a little problem here.
You see, I haven't found an apartment yet, and now that you're back early So, we'll just stay here together for a while, that's all.
Hey, you can have the bedroom, and I'll sleep on the sofa.
Oh, well, okay.
I mean, I don't see why I shouldn't.
You don't?
No.
Do you?
Me?
No, I don't.
You, Tony?
Hell, yes.
I do, too.
Hey, wait a minute.
If you guys are thinking what I think you're thinking, you're way off base.
Elaine is a friend of mine.
She needs a place to stay.
She'll stay here and everything will be fine.
Oh, yeah, sure it will.
Of course it will.
So let's not hear anymore about it.
Alex, there's something on your mind.
On my mind?
No, there's nothing on my mind.
Anything on your mind, Tony?
Hell, yes.
Mine, too.
Now, listen, guys, I'm starting to resent this a little.
Huh?
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry.
: Come on, we're acting crazy.
You're right.
I mean, it's just late at night, and we're all tired and this is so sudden, you know?
Look, Elaine, why don't you just turn in.
Bobby, you unpack.
Tony, you call the vice squad.
I'm standing watch No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
It's just a joke.
Come on, Tony.
Hey, Bobby.
Yeah?
You try anything on her, and I'll kill you.
Tony, come on.
This is Elaine we're talking about, remember?
Oh, yeah, right.
Elaine, you try anything on him, and I'll kill you.
Let's go.
Good night, you two.
Good night!
Good night.
My gosh.
Could you give me a hand here?
Yeah, there's that extra cover.
Oh, man, am I beat.
You know, this is Bobby, and you know what Bobby's like.
Yeah, I know what he's like, but what are we gonna do about it?
I mean, we got to trust him, right?
Trust him?
I know a girl on a bus who trusted him.
Look what happened.
Eh you're right.
The man's a hound.
Yeah, anywhere, anytime, anything with a pulse.
You think they heard us?
No, I don't think so.
Do you?
Hell, yes.
Me, too.
I thought she had an apartment.
Jim, they're turning her apartment into a co-op.
Remember?
Oh, yeah.
So while she looks around, she's staying with Bobby.
Well, that's real nice of Bobby to put her up like that.
Yeah, sure.
Real nice.
I don't trust him for one minute.
Call me old-fashioned, but this setup bothers me.
Well, times are changing too fast for me too.
Orgies where anything goes.
People wandering around naked in public places.
Sex that means no more than a handshake on the street.
I don't know.
Call me corny, but I miss those things.
You know, this setup still bothers me.
Tony, will you come off it?
Now look, there's nothing going on between Elaine and Bobby.
Besides, she's stuck on that guy Steve, right?
And even if she weren't, Bobby's your best friend.
That's got to count for something, right?
Hey, guys.
Hey, Bob!
You're right, Alex.
Hey, Bobby, I got to talk to you.
Yeah, okay.
You know, this thing with you and Elaine has really been bothering me, but if you tell me right now, as my best friend, that there's nothing going on, then that's good enough for me.
Hey, Tony, there's nothing going on.
How dumb do you think he is, Wheeler?
I'll show you how dumb I am, Louie.
I believe you, Bobby.
Nardo.
You and Wheeler better be careful.
You'll be hearing the pitter-patter of little hams in the house.
How's it going, Elaine?
Ah, terrific.
Yeah?
Yeah, it's been a good week.
Yeah, it's been you know, real nice.
I came home late from the gallery last night, you know, and Bobby was up reading, so we had a glass of wine together and talked real easily about some things I don't think I could've talked about with any other man.
Oh, really?
Like what?
Bobby's career, Bobby's dreams Bobby.
How did you ever drag all that out of him?
I think I said, "How are you"?
Gotcha.
Hello?
Elaine, it's for you.
Steve?
Oh, I'll take it.
She's going to talk to you.
Thanks a lot.
Hi, Steve.
You know, in my country, what Elaine and Bobby are doing-- it would be fine.
In my country, it is tradition for a man and woman to live together before they are married.
And to make love in every possible way so then they can see if they want to get married after that.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, that's a sensible tradition.
Thank you.
Now only if we can get the women to buy it.
Elaine you okay?
Uh, yeah, I think so.
What happened?
Well, uh, Steve called and said, can we get together for dinner so he could tell me something important.
And, uh, like an idiot, I said, "What"?
He said he didn't want to talk about it over the phone, but I kept pressing, so, uh, he told me that, uh, maybe it's better if we don't see each other for a while.
Aw Something about more time and more distance.
Hey, I'll tell you what let's do.
I'll get the guys together, and we'll go for some beers, to some nice place, and we'll talk about it, okay?
Thanks, Alex, but I think I'm gonna go home for awhile.
Elaine, I don't think you ought to be alone at a time like this.
I mean, not in the mood that you're in.
Oh, well, I-I won't exactly be alone.
I mean, Bobby will be there.
Oh, yeah, right.
Bobby.
Bobby?
Did you?
Yeah, and, you know, he can be real sweet and understanding at a time like this.
Bobby?
Hey, Alex, see you.
Yeah, see you, Bob.
Hey, Bob, wait.
Where you going?
Home.
Home?
Why home?
That's where I live.
Oh, yeah, uh, Bob, come here.
Uh um, um maybe I shouldn't get involved in your life like this, I mean, I'm the kind of man that doesn't like to get involved in his own life, but, uh Steve just called Elaine.
He broke it off with her.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Oh, poor Elaine.
Yeah, she's feeling very bad.
Look, she just said she wanted to go home and be by herself.
Well, if you're going to go home, that means you're both going to be home-- alone together for awhile.
So what?
No, no, Bob, Bob, look, I mean, she's feeling kind of depressed.
You know, she's very vulnerable.
And, uh, there's no telling what she might do in a mood like that.
You think she might come on to me?
Well Hey, Alex, really, thanks for the warning, and I'll be on my lookout, okay?
Did you hear that?
Of course I heard it.
I was the one he was talking to.
Oh.
Elaine's heart is broken.
Yeah.
This is terrible.
Yeah.
I'm afraid she's going to try to forget her problems by losing herself in a night of shameful lust and passion with the first man to come and cross her path.
You're afraid that's gonna be Bobby, right?
Well, if not, could you please give her my phone number?
Bobby?
Uh-oh.
Elaine, is that you?
Yeah.
I can't sleep.
Is there any more wine?
Wine?
Oh, yeah.
There's some more wine.
Did I wake you?
Oh, no, I was wide awake.
My head's clear as a bell.
I'm not about to do or say anything foolish.
It's cold in here, huh?
You know, Elaine, you might want to put a robe or two over your negligee.
You know, Bobby, this Steve thing has hit me pretty hard.
Do you think we could talk about it?
Oh, yeah.
Sure, okay.
Hey, the guy's a jerk.
You're better off without him.
How's that?
Oh, look, Elaine, I'm sorry.
Listen, the way this guy handled this thing just proves he's not the kind of guy who deserves you.
Oh, Bobby.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Oh, God.
Why aren't more guys like you?
You know, I have this great bottle of wine in my suitcase that I've been saving for a special occasion.
I'm going to go get it.
Oh, Bobby, I'm so glad you're here.
Hello, Alex, it's Bobby.
She's all over me.
Who were you calling this late?
Dad.
Good old Dad.
I thought your father passed away.
Well, maybe that will make up for the times I didn't call when he was alive?
What's wrong with you?
Listen, Elaine.
I really don't think we should do this.
We shouldn't do what?
What are you talking about?
Come on, Elaine, you know where this is going, huh?
The wine, the soft lights that flimsy flannel thing.
Where this?
Oh, my God.
Bobby, are?
Oh, this is ridiculous!
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, trust me on this, baby.
You know, I've been around.
I'm a sophisticated guy.
I've had a lot of experience.
And a moment ago, you and I were on the road to naughty-naughty.
"The road to naughty-naughty"?
Come on, Elaine.
I'm trying to be delicate about this thing.
You want me to come right out and say it?
O-Okay.
I'll come right out and say it-- You and I were that far away from doing foo-foo.
You're making me yearn for four-letter words.
Bobby!
You are absolutely and totally wrong.
I mean, you are so wrong, it's ludicrous.
Elaine, I'm just trying to do the right thing here.
You know what I mean?
You know, I don't believe this.
You and I have the greatest relationship going on in the last two weeks, and I come to you for a little friendship and a little sympathy, and I get this.
Okay!
Okay, maybe I was wrong.
Yes, you were.
I guess I was jumping to conclusions here.
Oh, absolutely.
Elaine, I'm really sorry.
I really feel like a jerk.
Well, you are one.
But it's okay.
Hey, um, can we just kind of forget this ever happened?
Huh?
All right, all right.
I don't see why not.
Let's get this wine open.
Yeah, here.
Hi, guys.
How you doing?
I was hoping you'd be home.
It's 3:00 in the morning, Alex.
What are you doing here?
I was just out taking a walk.
Barefoot?
Yeah.
I, uh I like the feeling of snow in my toes.
Hey, Bob, you don't happen to have anything for frostbite in your medicine chest, do you?
I'll get you some socks.
Thanks.
Okay, Alex, you have one chance to explain this to me.
Huh?
No, Elaine, I was, uh, I just had trouble sleeping so I thought I'd take a little walk.
And you guys are only I lost my slippers in a snowbank, see?
Here you go.
Bobby?
Oh, thanks.
That telephone call a few minutes ago, that was to Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, right?
Elaine, Elaine, we were very worried about you.
I mean, you're in a very vulnerable frame of mind.
That's right, Elaine.
So you thought you'd save me from myself, is that it?
Well, Bobby, you've succeeded in making fools out of all three of us.
You know something?
I really resent the implication that I'd lose control of myself just because I'm an emotional female at a weak moment, and you're a guy.
A great-looking guy.
Women always lose control-- is that it?
But men are always on top of things.
Well, Bobby, I hate you for this tonight.
And, Alex, I really resent you!
I might have expected this kind of attitude from Bobby, but I thought you had a little more class.
Yeah, Alex.
What?
What is it, Alex, a rule with you?
You only get involved in other people's lives if you can make a complete ass of yourself?
Well, I wouldn't call it a rule.
It's just the way it happens to turn out.
Look, I wouldn't be here in the first place if you hadn't made that stupid phone call.
Hey, hold it.
You're the one that told me she was gonna be coming on to me tonight like a Mack truck!
I never said anything like a truck.
You said something Look, I thought that you'd only get upset if something was really happening.
Something was really happening.
Like what?
She was walking around here in loose clothes, sipping wine and talking about love.
Bobby, the pope does that.
Oh Listen, I, uh I think I'd better go.
Sorry about your door.
Alex, you can't go out like that again.
You might as well just stay here.
Okay.
Elaine, would it be any better if Alex promised not to be this stupid again?
Come on, will you?
Look, Elaine, the only reason that we were this stupid is because we really care about you.
Well, then you two must care a lot.
Well, I guess it has been kind of a rough week for all of us, you know?
Yeah, you can say that.
I mean, I lost a boyfriend.
I lost my job in Florida.
I lost the feeling in eight of my toes.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Ignatowski.
Yo.
Janine!
I'm sorry, Mr. De Palma.
I didn't do very well.
No, no.
I just can't seem to get the hang of this.
Well, don't worry.
You're just learning.
What you need, Janine is, um for someone with some experience to take you out for a little on-the-job training.
Louie's still coming on to the new cab driver, huh?
Yeah.
I don't know how any woman can resist him, you know?
Now, I got an idea.
How about if I take you out and show you the ropes?
Oh, Mr. De Palma, you don't have to do that.
Now, Janine, I'd just feel terrible if you didn't work out here as a cabby and you left the Sunshine Cab Company without my trying to Score.
Score.
Look, Janine, don't don't listen to them.
That's just a little of their crude garage humor.
Yeah?
Jeff?
Give me the keys to Cab 881.
Here.
Come on, my little rookie.
Hey, Louie, you ain't no driver.
Banta, I was driving cabs when you were in the third grade-- your first year in third grade.
Hey, shouldn't we do something about this?
No.
Don't worry about it.
I taught her yesterday how to handle him.
What did you tell her?
I told her, "If he gives you any trouble just rap him on the snout with a rolled-up newspaper".
Hey, that's a good idea.
You know what bugs me about Louie is his attitude.
The way he treats women I know.
like objects, pieces of meat.
I mean, doesn't he know that thinking went out two to three months ago?
Louie never taught me how to drive.
In fact, every time I'd ask him a question, he tells me, "get lost".
That's because you don't have a great pair of legs.
Yeah, but Louie don't know that.
You know  I have a tip that I think might be helpful to young cab drivers.
Have you ever noticed that when you put the pencil behind your ear it tends to slither out when you go around sharp curves?
Yeah.
It happens to me all the time, Jim.
It's very annoying.
What's your tip, Jim?
Voila.
Oh, help!
Help!
It was awful!
I knew it, I knew it.
All right, what did he do?
Quick, get some water!
This lady's not feeling well.
All right, you're going to be fine.
Is she all right?
We'll take care of you.
Don't worry.
Jeff!
Yeah?
Call a doctor.
It's all right.
Please, don't make a fuss.
Hey, Louie, what happened, Lou?
She hurt herself.
All right, but don't worry, ma'am, 'cause you're in good hands here.
Lucky I was there to take charge of things.
Jeff, how you coming with that doctor?
It's ringing.
How did she hurt herself?
Oh, the poor woman, she had a dizzy spell and fainted in the street.
No, she didn't.
You ran over her.
Well, what difference does it make as long as she's okay and nobody got pictures?
You know, funny thing about this accident-- it made Louie a nicer person.
I mean, he keeps calling that old lady on the phone, sending her flowers, going to see her.
And he's been spending a lot of time with her.
Oh, poor thing.
Hasn't she suffered enough?
I know what he's doing.
He's trying to make friends with her so she won't sue him for his eyeballs.
You all remember Edith Tremayne.
And, Edith, you must remember the kids from the Sunshine Cab Company, where "safety first" is our only motto.
I'm so pleased to meet you all.
Mr. De Palma was kind enough to buy this wheelchair for me.
Well, well, well, Edith, you won't be needing this wheelchair long.
She'll be up and doddering about any time now.
And he sends me a dozen roses every day.
You're spoiling me, Louis.
You should be spoiled, Edie.
And now I'm going to show you all around the garage, and we'll go nice and slow.
We wouldn't want to have any accidents.
You know, something's been bothering me ever since he wheeled her in here.
Her face is familiar.
It's very familiar to me, only I just can't remember where from.
And over here we have the grease pit.
Oh, that reminds me.
I forgot to thank you for the lunch today.
Well, don't mention it, Edith.
Don't mention it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Uh, have you and I ever met?
No, I don't think so.
You look very familiar to me.
I probably remind you of your grandmother.
That's what everyone tells me.
Yeah.
I guess that's what it is.
Well, thanks for picking up the conversation, Rieger.
As I was saying all of our drivers are chosen for their intelligence, their maturity Uh, excuse me.
Do you know how many jelly beans I can hold in my mouth at one time?
No, I don't.
Well, I'll have to find out somewhere else.
And as you can see, we also hire those less fortunate than ourselves.
Now let me show you my cage.
This is the nerve center of the whole operation.
Oh, that isn't necessary.
Mr. De Palma, it's wonderful.
You have a lovely garage and you have a fine-looking group of employees.
And you, personally, have been as good to me as if you were my own son.
Well, Edith, in a way you do remind me of my dear, sweet mother.
God rest her soul.
Oh?
She passed away?
No.
This is her nap time.
Oh.
Well, your mother must be very proud.
You're a wonderful person.
Well, I think you're a wonderful person too.
And I'm glad to be a friend of yours.
And I'm glad to be a friend of yours.
And I hope our relationship isn't going to be hurt by this thing with the courts.
"Thing with the courts"?
Yes.
My lawyers are forcing me into suing you for a million dollars.
Thank you for showing me the garage.
Thank you.
You didn't see this yet.
What's going on?
Louie went up to break the news to Mr. Mackenzie.
Yeah, and try to get the cab company to pay legal expenses.
Oh, boy, there's going to be trouble.
Thank you.
I-I was sure you'd see it that way.
You're more than kind.
Thank you, sir.
So, what did he say?
The cab company's going to pay for everything  Oh, boy, are you lucky.
and then they're taking it out of my salary.
Louie, you have to pay for everything?
Everything, including the gas I used when I ran her over.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
A million dollars.
A million dollars.
If the cab company was to take $100 a week out of my salary a million bucks would take two Yeah, well that sounds a lot longer than it really is.
Ignatowski Huh?
these matters are too serious for you even to be here.
Go sit in the storeroom.
Can do.
I still wish I knew why that lady's face looked so familiar.
I can't believe her ingratitude.
I mean, after all the things I gave her-- the wheelchair, the flowers, the friendship The tread marks.
What I need here, is the best legal talent money can buy.
Jeff, give me the yellow pages.
Here, boss.
She's going to wish she never heard the name Louie De Palma.
I know that feeling.
This is great.
That old lady has got you.
Yeah, well, We'll see about this, Wheeler.
There you go.
You can't do better than this.
"Charles 'Speedy' Wyatt, Legal Services.
"Credit terms available.
"Free parking.
If I can't beat your rap, I'll eat a bug".
Now, Louie, this is not the time to economize, you know.
I mean, you are in serious trouble here.
I think you're right.
Now, my gallery has an attorney.
I'll see if he can help you out.
Thanks, Nardo, thanks.
What's the matter with you, Rieger?
I just remembered where I saw that old lady's face.
And it's funny?
Yes, it's very funny.
Do you remember Sonny Bergmeyer?
Sonny Bergmeyer?
Who's that?
Sonny Bergmeyer, he used to work here as a driver.
Oh, a driver?
Oh, mercy, a driver?
Well, wait, let me go check my scrapbook.
Louie, Sonny Bergmeyer ran over that same old lady a couple of years ago.
Are you sure?
I'm positive.
She sued him too.
But only Sonny checked her out and found out she'd been run over by cab drivers once a month for years.
Poor lady's got rough luck.
You mean to say that that sweet little old lady fakes accidents?
You got it.
It's the oldest trick in the book.
She steps in the path of a slow-moving cab, and just at the right moment, she fakes being hurt.
You're being sued by a con woman, Louie.
Aha!
I knew it wasn't my fault.
!
That's right.
Tell me, tell me more.
Tell me more, tell me more.
What did Bergmeyer do when she sued him?
Well, he No, I don't think you want to hear anymore.
Come on, Rieger!
No You know how my stories always bore you.
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!
All right, all right.
All right, all right!
What was it you wanted to know again?
Come on, Rieger.
!
All right, all right.
As far as I can recall, he rounded up those cab drivers that she had done that number on and he threatened to bring them into court to testify against her.
She dropped the suit immediately.
She was used to taking the cab companies and having them settle out of court.
She didn't want to go to trial.
I'll bet she didn't.
That's probably what she wants me to do-- settle out of court.
That's right.
Oh, I can't wait.
I can't wait.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to make her take me to court.
And then, when I get her there, I'm going to let her have it.
Huh?
I'm going to expose her.
That's it.
I'm going to make her little gray head spin.
I'm going to beat this rap just like Sonny Bergmeyer.
Where can I find this guy Bergmeyer, Rieger?
Bergmeyer?
I don't know.
He used to hang around Benson's cafeteria.
I don't think he does anymore, though.
Alex, you got to find him for me.
Why should I do that?
Come on, you're the only guy who remembers him.
Come on, you know him.
You know him.
Besides, with a nose like that you're better than a bloodhound.
That's what you consider sweet-talking, Louie?
Come on, Rieger, you've got to help me out.
I could stand to lose a million bucks here.
Listen if you can save me that, I'll give you $100.
Okay.
Okay, I'll do it.
Save your money.
I'll try to find Sonny for you if you do something for me.
Anything.
Anything.
Anything.
All right, no more ridiculing the cab drivers.
Right.
No more making passes at Elaine.
Good.
And no more cheap shots at Bobby.
Fine.
And no more jokes about my nose.
Oh.
Is it a deal?
All right.
It's a deal.
It's a deal Courtrooms give me the willies.
I had to go to court myself once a few years back.
Really?
Did they get you on drugs?
No.
I was already on drugs.
That's why I was there.
I just talked to Alex on the phone.
You're not going to believe this.
He finally found Sonny Bergmeyer.
Talk about cutting it close; the day of the trial.
You know, the trial's not going to start for a while.
Why don't we go and see if we can pick up some chicks out in the hall, huh?
Maybe we can get ourselves a couple of legal secretaries.
Yeah.
They got to be legal though, Bobby.
Hey, Jim, you want to come?
No, I'm going to stay here, look around a little.
All right.
Thank you.
I thought that was you, Edith.
Good to see you again.
Oh, the cast.
Nice touch.
You're not going to believe this, Tom.
The cast is real.
I actually broke my leg this time.
Come on, Edith, save it for the judge.
No, I'm telling you the truth.
It's the damnedest thing, I'm really hurt.
When I bounced off that cab, I broke my leg in two places.
So you mean we've actually got a legitimate case?
Well, there's a first time for everything.
Hope you didn't spend that million bucks yet, Edith.
Mr. De Palma.
Mr. De Palma, please.
When is your key witness going to get here?
Just relax.
Don't worry.
He'll be here soon.
Rieger's picking him up right now.
This is going to be the easiest case you've ever had.
Old Grandma Bunko's not going to know what hit her.
Boss Ignatowski, get the hell out of here.
Boss, I think there's something you ought to know.
The only thing I want to know is how fast you can get out of my sight.
Boss, this is really, really important.
You know how short my memory is, so let me tell you before I forget.
Okay.
What is it?
What's what?
Bean brain, get out of here.
So, you had no idea, Miss Tremayne, that the cab was coming towards you?
The only thing I noticed was the sign saying "walk".
I never even saw the speeding cab when it tried to run the light and came after me.
Okay, now let me ask you this, Miss Tremayne.
Have you ever had this kind of accident before?
Objection.
Will counsel for the defense approach the bench, please?
Rieger, where's Sonny?
Let me tell you about that.
He's here, right?
He was all ready to come in.
Said he was looking forward to it.
Said he wanted to see that old lady get what she deserves.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Then he asked me whose butt he was saving by coming in.
Right, right.
Then I did a very stupid thing.
I told him it was yours.
Huh?
He jumped out of the cab.
This is incredible.
Didn't you tell him if he doesn't come here that old bat's going to take me for everything I got?
I told him.
Well, what'd he say?
"The system works".
Rieger, Rieger, I'm lost.
I'm sorry, Lou.
There's one bright spot.
What's that?
Our deal's off, Aardvark nose.
There's got to be some way to Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Your Honor, may I ask the witness a couple of questions?
Well, that's within your rights as long as the opposing counsel for Miss Tremayne doesn't object.
Object to it?
On the contrary, Your Honor, we encourage it.
Mr. De Palma, I don't think you should do this.
Leave me alone.
I smell blood.
Uh, Miss Tremayne, it is your contention that your alleged broken leg has left you completely helpless.
It certainly is.
And you would have the court believe that, uh say in the case of earthquake or fire, or some other calamity, God forbid, you would be unable to get out of that chair and save your life?
That's right.
You're saying that if this wheelchair, for some reason, might go totally out of control you would not be able to get out of it?
That's right.
Well, I'm saying that you are not injured in the least and I'm going to prove it by doing this.
Don't worry.
She'll get out.
She'll get out of the chair.
She'll get out before she hits the stairs.
Don't worry.
Jump out, Edith.
Jump out, Edith.
Jump out, Edith!
!
Rieger, I didn't know   Rieger   Rieger, Rieger, what floor are we on?
The 16th.
I have no further questions, Your Honor.
Hi.
Oh, how's Edith?
Not too bad.
Boy, scared the hell out of her, though.
But the chair and the cast absorbed most of the damage.
She's not really hurt.
Mmm.
They put Louie in jail.
Yeah.
That judge was pretty mad.
Yeah, I'll say.
I never seen a judge try to hit anybody with his gavel before.
So, uh, what's going to happen now?
Well, fortunately, Sonny gave me some of the names of the other guys she conned.
Louie doesn't stand a chance of getting out of jail until I round up these guys and get them to talk to the judge.
So, there's not a moment to lose.
The quicker I make these calls the quicker Louie gets out of jail.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Here it is.
Here it is.
What?
What?
"Charles Darwin Tonight, starring Bobby Wheeler".
We made enough money in the first two weeks of the show to run an ad in the paper.
Ooh!
Let me see!
"A one-man show based on the life of Charles Darwin".
When I first read the script, I said to myself, "There's something about this play that I would go see".
What?
Me, alone on stage for 90 minutes.
I didn't know ham could keep that long under hot lights.
Food's here, guys.
Hey, hey!
Great!
We're starving!
All right!
I could use some of that stuff.
Yeah.
Hey, you know what?
What?
They gave us extra contest coupons.
What contest is that?
Hey!
Oh, they give you a coupon with every purchase.
If you get two coupons that match, you get the prize that's in 'em.
Come on, tell me something.
Have you ever met, or do you know, anybody who's ever won one of those contests?
I do.
Who?
Me.
I have won.
I have a match.
I won a complete men's wardrobe.
Hey, congratulations, Latka.
Ooh!
Is that the first time you've ever won anything?
No.
Once, in my country, one year, I won the prize in the lottery.
Oh, yeah?
What'd you win-- money, Latka?
No, no.
A fly swatter.
That's some lottery.
That doesn't sound like much of a prize, Latka.
No, he was a good worker and a very nice man.
Anyway, I got to go I got to go and pick up my new threads.
See you, Latka.
: I don't believe this.
Did anybody happen to read John Bowman's review on Anouilh's Thieves' Carnival in this morning's paper?
No, I didn't.
Did you read the story about the woman who got her cat's head stuck in her mouth?
No, Jim, I missed that one.
Well  let me find it for you.
L-Let me do mine first, okay?
John Bowman is one of the biggest critics in New York City, and one of the worst, if you ask me.
I mean, he hates everything he sees.
I mean, the man does not critique, he humiliates.
He's not a reviewer, he's an assassin.
Here, here, here, look, look.
Read this.
Read it for yourself.
"A 30-millimeter cannon "fired at the stage during production could not hit anything worth saving".
Hey, I'd like to see that.
What time do they shoot off the cannon?
"Forgettable as all the performances may be, "that of Patty Ganzel seems to vanish before your eyes.
"Not only is her acting suspect, "but her appearance is so horrifying "that it should henceforth be a felony to yell 'Patty Ganzel' in a crowded theater".
Ooh!
Ouch!
Ow!
That is not a nice review.
This is not a nice man.
But the terrible part is, is he has power.
Hey, I saw this play, and it wasn't that bad.
I mean, it needed work, but it didn't need to be killed and I know Patty, and she doesn't deserve this.
But, Bobby, he's a critic, so, uh, so what can you do?
I tell you exactly what I can do.
I can write this guy a letter and tell him what I think of him as a critic and as a human being.
All right, Bobby.
You know, better yet, I'm going to write the newspaper, so everybody can read it!
Ooh!
Good idea!
I'm gonna get you some paper.
Oh, good.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, boy, I'm gonna tell 'em exactly Bobby, you really serious about this thing?
You bet I am.
Well, then open up on him, Bob.
No, no, you see, Tony, I have to handle this with some finesse.
You see, I don't want to sink to his level.
Uh, Bobby?
Yeah?
"Slime wad" is two words.
Oh.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Okay, now.
"Your reviews are" Listen, I really need some, like, strong adjectives.
Uh, how about "reprehensible"?
Oh, that's good.
"Indecent".
Perfect!
"Purple".
Not as close.
Ah.
Good.
Good, good, yeah.
Yeah.
Signed, "Robert L. Wheeler, an actor".
Boy, I'd hate to get that letter.
That is very strong.
Yes, it is, and it's a very angry letter to a very powerful man, Bob.
Yes, and he is really gonna know who you are after he gets this letter.
I don't think I need "hate" in this sentence.
Bobby, Bobby, don't change nothing, man.
It's perfect.
This guy will go crazy when he gets that letter.
You know, you're right.
I can't send this.
What are you doing?
Ah What are you doing?
I can't send this, Tony.
Bowman will have me for breakfast.
Maybe someday, when I'm a big star-- you know, then he can't hurt me-- but right now, I'm a struggling young actor and I got to protect myself.
Wheeler.
Let's drive.
I think you did the smart thing, Bob.
I think you chickened out, Bob.
Tony, I didn't chicken out.
That letter could have cost me my career.
You did a smart thing, Bob.
Iggy?
Yo.
Minus ten and counting.
I can't do this.
It could ruin his career.
Fate.
Stop that!
What are you doing?
What are you dressed like that for?
I won it in the hamburger contest.
Get those things off.
Geez.
Hey, has anybody seen today's paper yet?
No.
No, I didn't.
Did the lady get the cat's head out of her mouth?
Come on, Jim, who cares about that?
Well, I know a cat and a lady who care plenty.
Come on, what's in the paper?
Look at that, it's Bobby's letter, he sent it in-- the one about John Bowman.
All right, Bobby.
He sent the letter.
He must have changed his mind.
Yeah, it took a lot of courage for him to send that one in.
Yeah, a whole lot of courage.
An incredible amount of courage.
It wasn't Bobby.
Nah, not him.
No.
Somebody must have gone through the trash can and, uh, sent the letter to the paper without Bobby knowing about it.
Ah, who could be so rotten?
Louie, how could you?
Do you realize this could cost Bobby his career?
Louie, could I talk to you for a minute?
I kinda figured you'd wanna.
I kind of figured you'd do that, so I came prepared to get into that cage.
He's going to get in the cage-- this fortress-- he's going to get in.
No way.
This is hermetically sealed, this cage.
All right.
All right, now, don't come near me.
I mean it.
I'm going to get him this time!
Nobody nothing's gonna stop me!
Hey, Bobby, it's your agent.
My agent's calling me?
!
Okay, okay, Louie, you stay right there.
Alex, come over here.
Take this.
Make sure he doesn't slither out of there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Louie, you know, I've had it.
You've had enough.
You've really done it this time.
When you sent that letter in, you went one step too far.
Here, Bob.
Hello?
Yeah, hi.
Listen, uh, about that letter.
It was a big mist Real Really?
!
Hey, well, that's really nice of you to say.
That's, uh Well, yeah, I guess it did take a little courage to send it but I've had that guy up to here, you know what I mean?
And you know what?
I'm going to send him another one!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Talk to you again sometime.
That was my agent.
He called me.
He liked the letter that I wrote to John Bowman.
Whoo-hoo!
That's not the only call you got this morning, Bob.
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid my little scheme backfired on me.
I've been taking messages for you all morning-- all of them from people congratulating you on the stand you made.
Yeah?
Yep.
Here's one from your union president.
"Tell him we're proud of him".
Here's another one-- "a credit to our profession".
Here's one from a repertory company.
"We wish we had the guts to do it".
Look at that.
Holy!
There's some really big names here.
Oh, wow!
Now I'm a hero and great-looking.
I'm proud of you, Bobby.
You pounded that guy.
Oh!
And that is not all.
What, what, what?
I got one here from your producer, who said to tell you that because of your letter and the attention that it's drawn, ticket sales have gone crazy.
All right!
Hey, I may even get paid this week.
It paid off this time, eh?
And What?
I saved the best for last.
What?
Your producer also told me to tell you that a certain very special VIP called personally and asked for tickets for your show for tonight.
To see me?
Especially to see you.
Ooh!
Who is it?
Guess.
Oh, come on, Louie, I can't guess.
Is it somebody, like, real big?
I mean, come on, give me a hint.
Big name.
Big name, Bob.
Oh, come on.
Big.
Please, please, tell me, tell me.
No, no, no, no, you gotta guess.
No, no, no no, you gotta guess.
No!
All right, I'll give you hints.
Oh, oh, good, good, good, good.
Okay, all right, listen.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Yah-huh.
Good.
Two.
Oh, uh, two words.
Two, uh, names.
Uh, first name.
Sign.
Uh, rest rooms.
Uh From Here To Eternity.
Jim, Jim-- shh, shh, shh.
Wait.
Wait.
John?
Right.
All right!
Uh, second name.
Bing!
Arrow.
Oh, oh-- Robin Hood.
Uh, The Magnificent Seven.
Jim, Jim, shh.
Wait.
Uh, okay.
Uh, John.
John.
John Archer.
John Shooter.
John Bowman.
Bowman!
Right!
John Bowman!
John Bowman the critic is coming to see me?
Oh, it's John Bowman!
John Bowman The guy I insulted is coming to review me and rip me limb to limb.
Oh, God.
Bing.
For my own part, I'd as soon be descended from that heroic little monkey who braved his most dreaded enemy to save the life of his keeper, as from a savage who delights to torture his enemies, practices infanticide with no remorse, knows no decency and is haunted by the grossest superstitions.
Coffee will be served during the intermission in the lobby.
Hey, Bob, that was A disaster.
No, Bobby.
The play stinks.
I stink.
Oh, come on, Bob.
Oh, no, oh, Bowman hates it.
Bowman hates it, and I bet you he is loving hating it, too.
Bobby.
That was great.
That was just great.
You know, this is the first time I ever see it and I don't know why everybody say it is too long and boring.
You know, I enjoyed it and to me, I think it was just right.
Well, there's a second act coming up, Latka.
Not for me, there isn't.
Eh, good-bye.
Good-bye.
Bobby it's going great-- better than the last time.
Jim laughed through the whole first act.
Look, guys, I know what you're doing and I really appreciate it but I know a bomb when I've been hit by one.
Ha!
You crazy guy.
Charles Darwin, eh?
Loony!
Thanks, Jim.
I'm glad you liked it.
Hey, listen, if you guys don't mind, I got to get myself together, here.
Oh, yeah.
I age 40 years in this thing.
Yeah, I guess it feels that way, huh?
No, Darwin is 40 years older in Act Two.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Let's, um we better get outta here.
Come on.
They're gonna start the second act.
Come on, let's get to our seats.
Just a sec.
Uh, Bobby?
Hmm?
Can I borrow your comb?
Sure.
Uh, Jim, why don't you just keep it?
Oh.
Thanks.
Okay, Bob.
Alex?
Yeah?
This is the worst night of my entire life.
Oh, no, Bob.
Bob.
You're doing great.
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
We will now discuss, in further detail, the struggle for existence.
You know,you were very, very good tonight.
No, I wasn't, Elaine.
I stunk tonight.
Oh, come on, Bob.
Stop being so hard on yourself.
Hey, Bobby, I think you were great.
I mean, in that second act, you were sweating like a pig.
I've never, never, never seen anybody sweat like that.
That's what I call talent.
Well, unfortunately, the only thing that matters is what Bowman thinks and he's going to rip me to shreds.
Aw, come on.
Oh, my God.
John Bowman just walked in the door.
Don't look.
Jim!
Why would he be here?
Well, maybe he's come to kill me with his bare hands.
Mr. Wheeler?
Uh, yes.
They told me at the theater I could find you here.
My name is John Bowman or, as you referred to me in your letter: "The carbuncle on the butt of the American theater".
Mr. Carbuncle?
My name's Jim Ignatowski.
Could I speak to you for a moment in private?
Sure!
Will you all excuse us for a couple of minutes?
Right this way, bunky.
Jim!
Jim, Jim, Jim, he's talking to me.
Oh.
Gee, I feel kind of silly.
Is he the playwright?
Right over here.
To be perfectly honest, Mr. Wheeler, I went to the theater tonight, expecting-- and hoping-- to hate everything I saw.
I was disappointed.
You mean you liked the play?
Are you insane?
That play is an excellent argument for dying young.
Then what did you like about it?
I thought your performance was engaging and energetic and, uh, courageous.
Here.
It's all here in my review.
"One of the most promising young actors "to emerge this season "triumphs over impossible material "He made me feel optimistic about off-off-Broadway theater again".
Mr. Bowman this is amazing.
I have to apologize for everything that I said in that letter.
For you to come here and show me this well, uh, I'm overwhelmed.
And people are going to know that you have a lot of integrity when this comes out in the newspaper in the morning.
Well, too bad it's not going to come out in the newspaper.
What-what-what what are you doing?
This is what you should have done with your letter.
You see, Mr. Wheeler, a bad review could make you a hero.
A good review could make you a star.
No review will keep you anonymous and you can keep on acting in church basements and supermarket openings, and your own mirror for the rest of your life.
Well, I enjoyed seeing you, Mr. Wheeler.
Ah, I've had a wonderful evening.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Now you mean you came here to show me this good review just to tear it up in my face?
Well, that's the cruelest thing I've ever seen.
Thank you.
Please, reconsider.
I'll tape it back together.
What am I doing?
I'm on my knees, here on the floor, groveling in dirt and beer, and for what?
Because of what you think of me?
Well, that's crazy.
The only thing that matters is what I thought of my performance tonight.
Right!
Right on, Bob!
Hey!
That's the Bobby of old, baby!
Bobby, the only thing that matters is your opinion.
Right, and you thought you stunk!
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hey, what's going on, huh?
How come none of you guys are out driving?
Louie's been upstairs in a meeting for an hour, you know, with the, uh, company executives and Mackenzie.
Well, what's the meeting about?
Got me.
Hey, does anybody know what's going on up there?
Well, uh, don't hold me to this, because I could be dead wrong, but if it's what I think it is, I haven't got a clue.
I know what I know what it is.
The company is broke.
What?
Where did you hear that?
From me.
Today, this afternoon, I tried to order parts, and everywhere I called, they said that our credit is no good.
Wow, the Sunshine Cab Company is broke.
It's your fault-- all of you!
You did this!
You couldn't just drive and be happy you had jobs.
No!
No!
Everything had to be just so.
The tires had to have treads.
The brakes had to have linings.
Okay, prima donnas-- you got them, now you don't have jobs.
I hope you're satisfied.
You finally killed the golden goose.
Now, wait a minute, boss-- maybe you're upset, but before you go throwing the blame around you better check your facts.
Anyone here go near that goose?
What are we going to do?
We'll have to find ourselves other jobs.
I guess we'll have to go to another cab company, huh?
Hmm, not me, I'm sick of driving.
I think I'm going to take this as a sign to break away and start fresh.
Hey, yeah, maybe losing our jobs is a blessing.
Yeah, maybe it's time to get out of the hack business.
Maybe it's time for us to shed these old, lousy, nowhere jobs and find new, lousy, nowhere jobs.
Sounds good to me.
: Well, count me in.
Okay, listen, we're all going to be out there looking for new jobs, right?
And we're all gonna be real curious to see what the others have come up with.
So, let's say in a month, we meet at Mario's All right, all right.
Terrific.
We'll meet in a month.
Yeah!
And we'll tell about the great jobs we all got.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
Come on!
Stretch!
Hey, all right!
Hey, Lou, how did, uh, Mackenzie take it?
The captain?
Yeah.
Huh!
Don't worry about him.
Nothing's going to get that old buzzard down.
Right now he's upstairs, brainstorming for an idea and believe me, he'll find a way out.
I wonder how long it took him to come up with that one.
Hey!
Hey, there she is!
Thanks!
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I-I had to wait for the sitter.
So, uh, what did I miss?
We've only been here for a couple of minutes.
Just time enough for "hellos".
Oh Oh, I haven't seen you guys since that terrible day in the garage.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeck, that was awful.
Yeah, but I knew Mackenzie wasn't the kind of guy who'd shoot himself.
Yeah, unfortunately he was the kind of guy who would shoot his accountant.
So why don't we get right down to it?
Okay.
What did everybody do during the month?
Yeah, come on, who's going to go first?
Uh What about you, Tony?
Okay, um, I looked around a lot, and I couldn't find anything, you know?
So I had to take this job with Lou-Lou the bookmaker.
I go around collecting money from people who are reluctant to pay up.
I was making fantastic money, but then after awhile the moral problem started to get to me.
Hmm I really appreciate you taking the time to see me like this, Father.
I always have time for those who come to me with problems.
Please, have a seat.
What can I do for you?
Uh Tony, if there's something you want to tell me, you don't need to feel embarrassed.
I just don't know how to start, Father.
This is real tough for me.
I'm not going anyplace.
Start, uh, whenever you're ready.
Well, you see, Father, the garage where I was working, it went bankrupt, so I had to go out and find another job.
I couldn't find any.
I looked real hard, but I couldn't find one except as a collector for a bookmaker.
A collector?
You know, I go around making people pay up their gambling debts.
Sometimes I got to act tough with them, but I never hurt nobody.
Tony, I hope you didn't come here expecting me to approve of that.
See, Father, if I didn't do the collecting, somebody else would-- somebody maybe not so nice.
So I don't think it's so wrong for me to keep doing it-- just until I find another job.
Come on now, Tony, if you don't think it's wrong, why have you come to me so troubled?
'Cause you owe 300 bucks.
Listen, I'm sorry, Father, but Lou-Lou says you're already overdue.
The money's got to be paid today.
I don't have the money!
I don't know what I'm going to do.
Well, how did you let this happen, Father?
I gave the locker room prayer for the Giants that week.
The team looked so up for the game, I didn't see how they could lose.
Especially with the 14-point spread.
Father, isn't it illegal and a sin to bet with a bookmaker, even with the spread?
Yes, I sinned and now I have to do penance.
I hate to do this.
Well, you But I don't have any choice.
That's right.
This watch was a personal gift to me from the Archbishop.
Give it to Lou-Lou.
I can't do this, Father.
No, no, no.
I made a mistake, I should pay for it.
Forget about the sentiment.
Nah, nah, you don't understand.
He only takes cash.
Perhaps if I spoke to him personally.
Come on, I'll go with you to give it to him.
No, he ain't going to take it, Father, I'm telling ya.
I have faith, Tony.
I always put my faith in the Lord.
Well, as long as you don't put your faith in the Giants again.
I'll-I'll talk to you later.
Come in.
Hey, Tony, you're back from making your collections already, huh?
Yeah.
How'd it go?
Fine.
Good.
Who gave us the priest?
He's the one who owes you the $300 from the Get rid of him.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you about Tony, I don't want to talk to no priest.
I don't want no priest in my office.
Father, would you excuse me for one second, okay?
Just a second.
Lou-Lou, he don't have the money.
He came here to give you a watch.
I don't want no watch.
When somebody don't pay up, it's your job to explain those rules to them by whatever means available.
Father, you want to come in here, please?
Hey, Father, I'm just gonna have to pay up your debt myself.
I can't let you do that.
No, no, Father, it's okay.
I'd rather do it this way.
Tony, Tony, don't be a sap.
All right, I can afford it better than Tony can.
Give me the watch, Father, and we're even.
It was given to me by the Archbishop Yeah, yeah, sure.
Thank you, Lou-Lou, you're a good man.
I want you both to know I'm never going to gamble again.
Thank you, Tony.
Any time, Father.
See you later.
I can't believe you took his watch.
I'm sure I will treasure it forever.
Hey, uh, Lou-Lou, uh, I don't want to mention this, but you said I was getting paid Friday and today's Friday, and I really need the money.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Here, congratulations.
So, uh, Elaine, that makes you next.
Well, okay.
I went to work as a secretary for this large corporation downtown, right?
So, the first day the personnel director takes me to the office and she just leaves me there.
So I'm sitting there waiting for my boss, wondering what he's going to be like Are you Mr. Givens' secretary?
Uh, yes.
Hello, um, my name is Elaine Nardo, and I Don't try to be pleasant with me.
Is he in his office?
Uh, no, I-I'm sorry.
He's not in right now.
Well, then, perhaps you'll be so kind as to tell me where that horse's rear end is.
He was supposed to be in my office half an hour ago.
If Mr. Givens doesn't have a good excuse this time, he's fired.
Uh he's, uh his car broke down.
Splendid, Miss Nardo.
I'm George Givens.
Welcome aboard.
You're Mr. Givens?
Why did you do that?
Ah, I was just giving you a little battlefield experience.
It doesn't happen often, but every once in awhile, people look for me.
When they do, it's very important that I be somewhere else.
Why?
Sit down, Miss Nardo.
I've been working for this company for 23 years.
That is a record.
No one's been here longer than I have, and the reason I've lasted so long is because no one quite knows who I am.
Oh, some people know my face.
Some people know my name.
But very few of them put them together.
My dearest friends in this company know me as "what's-his-name"?
Come on, now-- isn't this a little ridiculous, Mister You're right, you are forgettable!
Thank you.
Over the years, I've developed a lot of techniques.
For instance, meetings are my biggest challenge.
I slip in with the crowd, and I never say anything except "Mm-hmm" or "Mm-mmm".
And most importantly, I laugh only after everyone else starts laughing and stop cleanly before they stop.
Do you have any questions?
Yes uh Mr. Givens, I don't know much about business Oh, that doesn't matter.
But, uh, I've read some of your reports and I think it's wonderful what you've written.
You read my reports?
Yes.
What do you think, I write those reports to be read?
But-but Mr. Givens, I-I was so impressed.
You shouldn't be afraid to speak out.
Mr. Givens, a man with your experience and-and your obvious intelligence should be heard.
You shouldn't deprive others of your ideas.
You really think so?
Oh, I know so.
I don't know, I, uh it's been a long time since I had that Well, hello there.
Hi, how are you?
Good, good!
Oh!
It's good to see you.
Mr. Givens in?
Thank you for your illuminating report, Mr. Barrett.
Good show, Jack.
Now, if there are no other reports I think we can adjourn the meeting.
Mr. Givens Mr. Givens, your ideas are so much better than anyone else's here.
Please, Mr. Givens, this company needs to hear from men like you.
Maybe tomorrow.
Mr. Givens?
What if they don't like my ideas?
Maybe they'll fire me.
Oh, no, no, no.
The worst they'll do is disagree with you.
Mr. Givens, if you don't give your report today-- right now-- your 23 years with this company will come to nothing.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Who said that?
Who said that?
You said that.
I said that?
I said that.
Oh.
There's one more report.
Very well, uh, the chair recognizes what's-his-name.
Mr. Givens!
Let me just summarize what I've come to say.
I've been with this company for 23 years now.
Yes.
And I must admit, I've seen some mistakes made-- not big mistakes-- little tiny ones.
Damn it, I've seen big mistakes made.
I think I can summarize my ideas with one simple word, and that word, gentlemen, is "divest".
Get rid of the movie theaters.
Cable television's going to wipe them out.
Don't tell me about real estate.
Every yutz with ears is into real estate.
Forget South America.
You're not nervous about South America?
I'm nervous about South America.
We don't need burlap anymore.
Polyethylene's taking over the market.
Sell the forests-- sell the coal fields, sell the chemical companies.
Divest, gentlemen!
Divest yourselves of everything but the three basics: Nuclear weapons, hospitals and T-shirts.
And, uh if I'm wrong about this, my 23 years with this company have come to nothing.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you for talking me in off the ledge.
I am so sorry about this, Mr. Givens.
It's all my fault.
You know it's the silliest thing.
All these years, I've been so frightened of being fired, and now that it's happened it's far more hideous than I imagined.
What a lovely family you have.
Well, thank you, but they're not mine.
Who are these people?
That picture came with the frame.
Executives who don't have families are talked about, so I kept it on my desk.
I see.
I call the little boy Skipper.
Good choice.
He chipped a tooth a couple of weeks ago.
The oldest girl is married now.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Her husband drinks a little more than I'd like him to I'm so sorry about this.
Well, that's over.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Miss Nardo could I buy you dinner?
I can still charge one last big meal to my expense account.
Oh, um, Mr. Givens, I don't know if I could do that to a company that I work for.
Used to work for.
They fired you, too.
Let's break 'em.
Well, it's your turn next.
Uh, I was a door-to-door salesman.
It was nice getting away from the pressures of driving a cab.
Forgetting for awhile about red meaning stop and green meaning go, oh!
In fact-- if it hadn't been for one thing, I would've gone on being a door-to-door salesman.
What was that?
I didn't like it.
Uh  how do you do, Mr. or Mrs. Fill-in-name-of-couple?
I, uh I'm your-name-here, but you can call me nickname.
Uh it's very nice to see you this afternoon.
Uh May I ask you are you satisfied with your present vacuum cleaner?
Well, ours hasn't been working too well lately, but I May I come in and-and talk to you about Magic Carpet Wizard?
Uh I suppose so, yes, okay.
Okay.
I did it, I got in!
I'm going to do okay at this job.
Okay why don't you make yourself comfortable?
Uh What you are about to see is a revolutionary new carpet machine that's more than a vacuum, more than a shampooer more than something else.
It's the Magic Carpet Wizard, the all-purpose carpet cleaner.
All right.
Oops, a little dirt.
Can your vacuum cleaner clean that up?
Yes.
Of course it can-- but can it clean up this?
Uh, well, I don't know Well, and ho and how about this?
Oh, no, I don't think so.
And, uh, and, uh, this.
No.
Oh, no!
Oh, just leave this in No.
And how about this?
Ketchup!
Does this machine clean up ketchup?
Oh!
We wouldn't call it the Magic Carpet Wizard if it didn't perform miracles.
Oh!
Oh, oh, I I-I think I get I get the point!
I get the point!
Uh uh uh N-Now let me see the machine clean it up.
First, let's make it tough.
Here, a little bit of that.
Oh, no, no, wait, that's grease!
That's grease.
It ain't no problem for the Wizard.
Okay, there.
Oh.
Let's grind it right in.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Now that's enough.
We are going to see this cleaned up fast and easy.
Where do I plug this in?
Uh let's see Oh, there's-there's a Uh A book?
A book?
Oh, yeah, yeah I didn't get the vacuum job.
I'm selling encyclopedias.
Okay, you're next, Latka.
What kind of a job did you get?
Well, I would love to tell you about it but my break is over.
Hey, come on, Latka, there's lots of tables to be cleaned.
Okay.
"Come on, Latka, there's a lot of tables to be cleaned".
You know, I-I would not be offended by a tip.
Well, I would be by that one.
Come on, give tip-- big tip.
Keep it coming.
Next week on Taxi the stories continue.
My God, what is that in Corridor C?
What's creeping down the wall in Corridor C?
Oh, my God!
Actually, I'm really an actor.
I was born dirty, Mr. Gray and every day I get dirtier and dirtier.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
You couldn't just drive and be happy you had jobs.
The Sunshine Cab Company is broke.
We'll have to find ourselves other jobs.
We'll meet in a month and we'll tell about the great jobs we all got.
Yeah!
Here.
Congratulations.
Hello, my name is Elaine Nardo.
Come on, Latka, there's a lot of tables to be cleaned.
Oh, I forgot.
Tonight's the night the losers get together to share their success stories.
It's going to be a short evening.
You have made lots of money, Louie?
Oh, I get by.
No one ask him.
Ah, well, I can't stick around.
I got to get back to work.
I just stopped by to have a beer and gloat.
Hey, Louie, you forgot to sign your unemployment check.
Go, Louie.
All right, before you laugh at me you better listen to my story.
Thank you.
All right I said I could succeed in any field and I proved it.
I went down to Wall Street and I became a stockbroker.
Get serious.
You've got to be kidding?
You, a stockbroker, Lou?
Give us a break, Louie.
Hey, I'm not saying it was easy to break in.
These reports look fine.
File them with the Clifton portfolio and bring me the Wesley- Cosgrove prospectus.
Yes, sir.
You the top dog here?
I didn't know Guys and Dolls was in town.
Excuse me.
You can't barge in here like this.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Are you the cheese or not?
I'm the head of this firm, if that's what you mean.
Snap this picture.
Future generations are going to want an exact record of the moment that you hired your greatest salesman.
Say "cheese," Cheese.
There you go.
Miss Lang, what are you doing?
Call security.
Yes, sir.
Good, good, call security.
If I can't convince you to hire me by the time they get here, I'll leave.
You know what the problem with this company is, Mr. Gray?
You don't know how to get dirty.
What this organization needs is a man who can get dirty-- someone who'll go out there and scrape up any business he can, any way he can, from anybody who's got a couple of bucks.
You don't need fancy clothes and a nice education to make money.
What you need is volume.
You need hustle!
You need to get dirty!
I was born dirty, Mr. Gray, and every day I get dirtier and dirtier!
Trouble, Mr. Gray?
Go on.
And dirtier!
Hello, De Palma here.
You want a quote?
Hang on a second.
Let me have that.
All right, 33 1/8.
All right, all right.
Hello there, De Palma here.
Oh, Tom, baby, how are you?
All right.
Yeah, listen, Tom, I'm very upset to find out that you've got your entire account sewed up in one stock, but if you want to bounce up and down the boards with AT&T, that's your business.
I'm telling you, Tom, they're a fly-by-night outfit.
Hold on a second, something just flashed on the big board.
Hello there, sweetheart.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
We've met.
That's not the pleasure I was talking about.
Tom, listen to the words that are going to send you to an early retirement: Genetic research.
You know, cloning and stuff like that.
Listen, today they're doing it with rats.
Tomorrow, they'll be cranking out Cheryl Tiegs by the dozens.
Ah, I know what you're going to say.
I know, you got a philosophical problem because there's a possibility that something maybe could go wrong.
I mean, some mutant virus could wipe out half the world.
If you're in the half that's still around do you want to be rich or not?
All right, all right.
I'm going no further on this.
I'll put you down for 5,000 shares.
If you change your mind, you get back to me, okay?
Yes, guys, that's the way he does it.
All right.
Let's see Whoop!
Hello, Mrs. Greer?
Uh, this is Louie De Palma.
Have you decided what to do with your husband's life insurance settlement yet?
Well, I noticed in the obits this morning that he died last night.
Oh, oh, oh, well, well, um, I'll call back in a you know, after the services.
All right, in the meantime, think chemicals and electronics.
All right.
Okay, let's see Hello, Myron Schwartz?
This is your cousin, Louis Ginzberg.
No, I was at your wedding.
We met behind the chopped liver.
Uh, listen, listen-- I think our family should stick together.
I got some hot stock here and I saved some for you.
I'll send you the prospectus.
Don't mention it.
Shalom.
Uh  Uh, I'll be right with you.
Uh, Mr. Tobias?
Uh, this is Louie De Palma.
Oh, well, have you ever thought of investing in the stock market?
Oh, well, is your mommy home?
No?
Well, do you know where your mommy keeps her checkbook?
Uh, all right, look, David, David, I'll have to get back to you.
Okay.
All right, bye-bye.
Uh, Mr. De Palma, I have to speak to you about something.
I'm very busy here, so make it quick.
Certainly-- you're fired.
I rushed you a little bit, didn't I?
I'm sorry, I I made a mistake.
You simply don't fit into our organization.
I'm I'm I'm making more money than anybody here!
We realize you're doing high-volume business.
That's not the problem.
It's your demeanor.
Your taste in clothing is loud.
Your taste in everything is loud.
You're loud!
Secretaries have been complaining.
You eat too much in the corporate dining room.
You make noises when you eat.
Everybody makes noises when they eat.
Everybody makes eating noises when they eat.
Yours are not eating noises.
Yours are not human noises.
What are we talking about here?
I mean ethics or something?
Oh, no, I certainly have no complaints about your ethics.
You have no ethics.
The problem is we can't stand you.
Everyone's complaining.
It's nothing personal, you're just disgusting!
What you call disgusting, I call selling!
I'm better at this business than any of you.
I just don't look the part.
I don't behave like the rest of you.
I didn't go to the right college, or any college, but let me tell you something, Mr. Gray.
I'm going to leave here feeling good about myself because I know that I succeeded.
You have to stay here knowing that some guy off the street can outdo you.
Hmm!
I'm sorry.
Uh, Mr. De Palma, I like to think that even the most fleeting and shallow relationships in this life somehow enrich us.
I think if you take a good look at this situation you'll find you've profited by it.
I couldn't agree more.
So long, loser.
Louie, phone for you.
That's probably Wall Street begging me to come back.
Go.
Go.
So, Bobby, I guess it's your turn.
What job did you get?
Um, I got something in the entertainment field.
All right, Bob!
That's interesting, Bob.
Well, sort of.
What do you mean sort of?
Well, I had a real hard time finding anything, so I took a job in a department store doing parties.
People would have parties for their children and they'd hire me to come to the party and I'd play a part.
Oh, yeah?
What kind of part?
Um well, nothing crazy.
Something pretty traditional, actually.
Is this the Beck residence?
Yes, it is.
Well, I'm here for your party.
Oh, good-- come in, please.
That's that's a nice outfit.
Thanks a lot, but you got to understand, this is not what I do for a living.
You just do it for fun?
No not for fun.
I'll get the kids.
Hey, listen, um excuse me, aren't you Cynthia Beck, the film director?
That's right, I am.
My name's Bobby Wheeler and and I just love your work.
Well, I've always admired your jelly beans.
Hey, listen, actually, I'm really an actor and I haven't done very much, but I'm really, really good.
And I'd love to read for you sometime, but you're really hard to get in to see.
Uh, the kids are kind of restless.
I'll send them right in.
Okay.
Kids, come on, the Easter bunny wants to see you.
Hi, kids.
Yeah!
I'm the Easter bunny and I've come all the way from the enchanted lettuce patch just to spend Easter with you.
Now, you want to sing a song?
Hmm?
Okay.
Okay, now you join in.
I think you'll know this one, okay?
All right.
Okay.
BOBBY : * Here comes Peter Cottontail * Hoppin' down the bunny trail * Hippity-hoppity, Easter Oh!
And now, kids, in keeping with the Easter season the Easter bunny has a special surprise for you.
He's going to perform a scene from the Broadway play Whose Life Is It Anyway?
That's right, kids.
The Easter bunny is also a serious artist, too.
Now, you have to pretend that the Easter bunny's paralyzed from the neck down.
And he's talking to his doctor, okay?
You got that, right?
Good.
: Can't you see that is why I've decided that life is not worth living?
I'm not human!
And I'm even more convinced of that by your visit than I was before.
Now, how does that grab you?
The very exercise of your so-called "professionalism" makes me want to die.
She was so impressed by my performance that she offered me a part.
Really?
Yeah.
What part?
The clown at her daughter's birthday party.
All right, Bob!
Well, um that leaves, uh the guy in the yellow sweater.
Yeah, Alex, tell us.
What'd you do?
What'd you do?
What'd you do?
Come on.
Well, I, uh I took a job as a night watchman in an office building.
A night watchman?
I thought I would, you know, have a lot of time to myself-- you know, catch up on a lot of reading I always wanted to get done.
Well, the first couple of weeks it was kind of boring.
But after that I started to go a little nuts.
Oh, what the hell, let's make it an even number.
Oh, what else is left on the agenda?
And I had dinner Oh, next is my rounds, make sure the building is secure.
My rounds, my rounds.
Corridor A, Corridor B, Corridor C, Corridor D. Wow.
Work, work, work, work, work.
Keep in shape.
This is how I look when I talk.
This is how I look when I say, "This is how I look when I talk".
This is how I look when I smile.
This is how I look with my flashlight in my mouth.
This is how I look when I'm the star of my own TV show: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to The Alex Rieger Show, starring Alex Rieger.
Now let's get to our first guest.
Our first guest this evening, ladies and gentlemen, is the greatest juggler in the world.
And let's see if I get his name straight here: Alex Rieger!
I am now going to attempt juggling backwards.
With one leg.
Now, for my greatest trick, ladies and gentlemen, I must have complete silence.
I am going to juggle and eat at the same time.
This is station Y.A.W.N.
signing off after an evening of telecasting.
Oh Hi, Henry.
You okay?
Oh, sure, sure, I'm fine, Henry.
Well, I'll just be going along now.
Yeah, just take it easy, Rieger.
It's just the first couple of weeks on this job that are kind of tough, you know?
But once you've been at it 20 years like I have, boy, you're going to learn to handle it.
Thanks for the tip, Henry.
Take it easy.
Yeah, good night.
Gee.
Boy gee.
It's time now for The Harry and Muffy Show!
Yeah!
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Well, who are our guests tonight, Muffy?
Harry you are a sick man.
Listen up, dregs of society.
The Sunshine Cab Company was just purchased by a new owner.
All right?
We're back in business, boys and girls.
If you want your jobs back, you better follow me.
So okay, so cab driving is a stinky, lousy job that, uh has no comforts and no dignity and no future, but on the other hand would anyone like to help me with the other hand?
On the other hand we stink at everything else?
Come on!
All right!
I guess Let's go, Latka.
Hey, Tom, on my tab.
You got it, Tone.
Take this job and shove it.
You know something?
I can't believe it, but it's actually good to be back.
Yeah, I have to admit it.
It is.
Who ever thought we'd miss this crummy place?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Oh, my God.
It actually feels like home.
Yeah, it sure does.
Well, let's get to work.
Yeah.
Hey what is it we do?
We're cab drivers, Jim.
Ah, come on.
No, really.
Wow!
Ignatowski Banta Wheeler, 603.
Old 603.
Nardo Rieger   Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
I waited till everybody was over at Mario's because I didn't want to take any more razzing over this.
Now, you say this poison works on all kinds of cockroaches because I got a monster in there.
A monster.
No insect can survive this poison.
Respect your foe.
We're not talking about just any insect.
This is the biggest cockroach in the world.
I'm telling you, he barks at the mailman.
Don't worry about it, Mac.
I'll get him.
Take no prisoners.
Right.
Describe to me again what this stuff does to him.
Well, it, uh, paralyzes the central nervous system, blocking and then causing cessation of all the metabolic functions.
At least, that's what the can says.
As long as I can see his little feelers twitching in the air, I don't care how you do it.
Oh  Excuse me, Latka?
I said, oh  Is something wrong, Latka?
I enjoy watching her.
Oh, yes, she's very enjoyable.
Yeah, she has been in here before.
Each time she gets more beautiful than the last.
Look at the way she sits on the stool like a princess.
Oh You got a little crush on her, don't you, Latka?
Why didn't you tell us, huh?
It brings me too much pain.
She doesn't know I'm alive.
Can't she tell you're alive by the way you move around and talk and stuff?
Huh?
Hey, Latka, just go over there and introduce yourself.
Say hi, she may like your style.
No, I could not do that.
Why not, Latka?
Why not?
Well, how do I say this?
You see, I do not have too much success with American women.
You see, the men from my country are not, for some reason, attractive to the women in your country.
We do not, as a matter of fact, have much luck with the women in my country.
Latka, if I were you, I'd go over there and say hello.
Bobby, if I were you, I would go over and say hello.
But, unfortunately, I am me.
Oh, what kind of attitude is that, Latka?
Come on, you are an attractive person with a lot to offer.
Remember that.
Yeah.
By golly, I will do it.
All right.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow, first thing, I promise.
Latka, there is no time like the present.
No, wait.
Come on.
Wait, wait, guys, guys!
Come on, don't force him.
Let him make up his own mind.
Alex.
What?
Mind your own business.
Mind my own business.
Come on, guys.
Okay, now, you're going to do fine, Latka.
Shh.
Hello, I am Latka Gravas.
You're what?
Hello, I am Latka Gravas.
That is my name-- Latka Gravas.
I think you are very pretty American woman.
Oh, well, thank you.
Maybe could I please have a drink with you?
Or food?
Or or even gum?
Bubble gum?
I'm really not interested.
Thank you.
Then I guess it will not be necessary for us to look for a house over the weekend.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, bye-bye.
It was nice meeting you.
Boy, it sure is a long walk back.
Sorry, Latka.
She shot you down, huh?
Yeah, she shot me down.
Ah, she didn't even give you a chance.
That stinks.
It's all right, I forgive her.
Yeah, well, I don't.
There's such a thing as sensitivity to other people.
I think I'm gonna go over there and tell Miss High-and-Mighty where to get off.
Hey, wait a minute, Bob.
Let it go, will you?
Alex, it's okay, I'm not going to make a scene.
It's just I can't let this thing rest.
You know, Latka, I bet it has nothing to do with you.
You know, I bet that she's committed somewhere.
You know, she's engaged or married, or, you know, living with someone.
Okay.
She needs a cab.
Yeah, I-I'm just going to give her a ride home, professionally, and talk about Latka all the way.
Hey, now Alex, what can I do?
She needs a cab, huh?
Hey, Latka, if it bothers you, listen, I'll forget about it right now.
Oh, no, you don't worry about it, Bobby.
You just go and have a wonderful time with the woman who makes every tissue in my body scream with desire.
Okay, thanks a lot, Latka.
Boy, what a nice person.
Ooh, look at this.
Get a load of this one.
Ooh.
Hey, Latka, what are you doing, reading Playboy magazine?
Oh, yes, I am studying it, Alex.
I want to be up front with you.
I want to be an American fun guy taking each day in high gear.
Did I say that right?
I hope not.
Well, what's the point?
Well, the point is that I am sick of you all calling me a cute, little foreigner.
We don't call you a cute little foreigner.
Well, maybe not to my face, but behind my back.
Uh-uh, we don't call you that behind your back.
Well, maybe you don't say it out loud, but you think it.
We don't even think it.
Oh, yeah?
Well, how about the time Tony said his uncle was broke, and I said, "Well, why doesn't he go to the doctor"?
Yeah, that was kind of cute.
See, "cute" again.
Everything always cute.
I am sick of being cute.
When will it end?
But Latka, I don't see how reading a bunch of magazines is going to make you more sophisticated?
Well, Alex, I am not only going to read it, I am going to take a vacation from the garage, I am going to lock myself in, every spare minute, I am going to study this Playboy.
Mm-hmm.
And I have a tape of an F.M. D.J. I am going to learn to talk like him so that when women hear my voice, they will just relax.
See, I will do it even if it takes me eight days.
Look, here it is.
I have it marked.
I am going to "alter my lifestyle to fit the fast lane".
Huh?
: "Alter my lifestyle to fit the fast lane".
: "Alter my lifestyle to fit the fast lane".
: "Alter my lifestyle to fit the fast lane".
: "Alter my lifestyle to fit the fast lane".
: "Alter my lifestyle to fit the fast : lane".
Whoop!
There, that ought to do it.
Now now, how soon is it safe to go back in there?
Well, that depends on your system, you know.
Some people, they go in there the first day, they get sick.
Other people might get a headache.
Me, I like it.
All right.
Thanks, pal.
Ha!
It's great to have the cage back.
All right.
It's worth every penny for the piece of mind.
Come on in here, Jeff.
I'm starving.
Sandwich.
Mustard.
* No bugs allowed * No bugs allowed * No bugs allowed.
Jeff  It's Karen.
The princess is honoring us with her presence.
I bet you she's insulted we're not groveling at her feet.
Oh, you're handling rejection so much better than you used to, Bobby.
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys.
Latka's back from his vacation.
He's on his way in right now.
I got to pick a good spot so I can see all your faces when you first see him.
I got it.
Go ahead.
Oh, my God.
What did I tell you?
Latka?
: Hey, I love you guys, you're beautiful.
Hey, Tommy, making any money?
Latka?
What kind of imported beer you got?
Schlitz.
Schlitz.
I love you, Tommy, you're a mug.
Give me one of those.
Thanks.
I can take one look at you and tell that you've heard every phony line in the book so one more isn't going to hurt you, right?
She's laughing.
Ah but seriously now.
The first few moments of a relationship set the tone for the whole thing, if you know what I mean, so let's be honest.
My name is Vic.
I'm into Italian cars, Technics stereos, Australian films and beautiful ladies.
If you're interested, let's talk.
If not, it's been fun.
Vic, huh?
No, not "Vic, huh"?
-- Vic Ferrari.
Vic Ferrari?
That isn't your real name, is it?
Why don't you tell me after you see how I perform on a tight corner.
Terrible humor, Vic, but I love that smile.
Come on, walk with me, talk with me.
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
It's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hekyll.
Latka.
Excuse me, I think these people have mistaken me for someone else.
I'm a dime a dozen.
Don't you believe it.
Be right back.
All right, Latka, way to go.
You got her, buddy.
Hey, she's a woman, not a prize.
Hey, I love you guys, but I don't like your "keeping score" attitude.
Latka, she can't hear you now.
You can drop the act.
The act?
Hey, man, you got it backwards.
I dropped my act.
You guys could stand to do the same thing.
Hey, Elaine.
You're looking dynamite tonight.
Corny, but sincere.
Gotcha.
Come on, let's go, honey.
Poor, Latka.
What do you mean, Jim?
Everybody's beating time with his woman.
First Bobby, and now that jerk.
Latka!
Latka!
Latka!
Latka!
: Hey, man, what is your problem?
I don't like people playing music in this garage.
Well, I don't like this authority trip that you're always laying on me, man.
Hey, you just wasted Elvis Costello.
Latka, you're getting weirder every day.
Now, I don't want to have to fire you for this, because I don't want to have to fire you I was hoping to fire you just for no reason.
Look, you better wise up.
Knock it off.
And try wearing some decent clothes to work.
You look like a foreign banana.
Well time for my sparkling water break.
Anybody want some?
He's not coming out of this.
If anything, it's getting worse.
It's been going on for a week now, night and day.
Maybe somebody should talk to him.
Hey, I tried.
He just keeps telling me I'm one dynamite lady.
I keep telling him that's beside the point.
get an answering service.
Hello.
Yeah, Vic's here.
Hold on a second.
Hey, Latka, it's Karen for you.
I'm not here.
Latka, it's the girl you're crazy about, remember?
Hey, I am out man, read my lips.
Uh, yeah, no, he's not here.
Yeah, okay, sure.
I'll tell him you called.
Bye.
Latka, what's going on?
It's over between her and me.
You see, Karen is the kind of chick who craves rejection and goes around creating it for herself.
So what's a boy to do?
This is too much.
Latka, we got to talk to you.
Hey you know I always have time to talk to you, Elaine.
You're one dynamite lady.
Latka, shut up.
Ooh-hoo, redheads.
I'm glad you feel that you can be so honest with me like that.
Latka, come here and sit down, okay?
Hey, Latka, Latka, you're weird.
Hey, we're all coming from a different direction, and sometimes it doesn't get in synch.
Sorry about that, but you had it coming.
Latka, can't you see what's going on?
Can't you see what you're doing to yourself?
Yeah, I'm assimilating.
Hey, Latka, why don't you come off it, huh?
Hey, if I have to be a cute little guy who strikes out every time in order to be Mr. Popularity around here, well then you can just keep your trophy.
Would you just stop it?
Well, excuse me.
I thought that I had the right to evolve, but I'm sensing a lot of hostility here.
Fortunately, I got my friend Alex.
My man, Alex.
With a heart as big as his schnoz and a brain as sharp as his profile.
Yeah, well, I'm very flattered.
Very flattered.
Hey, man, you understand what I'm talking about, don't ya?
Yes, I think I do.
Yeah.
God bless the people.
Adios, kids.
Hey, where you going?
Hey, come on back.
Hey, man, don't leave me.
Come on.
I tell ya, Latka, I've been going back and forth about this thing, because I think maybe you're justified in thinking that there was a patronizing element in the way people used to treat the old Latka.
But the thing that keeps coming through to me is I like that old Latka, and I don't like you.
Ooh, hard to get happy after that one.
Hey, Alex, I think we've got some head-butting to do.
You dropped a real load of guano on me today, and I think we should get out our shovels and see if we can   Please, don't slam the door on me again, because I don't think I could take that.
I really want to talk to you.
What do you have to say you haven't said already?
I cry at night.
Alex, please help me, you've got to help me.
I don't know what to do.
I'm stuck inside of here.
I don't like this guy.
I don't remember how I got in.
No, no, no.
I'll help you, I'll help you, I'll help you.
Listen, just sit down.
Just sit down.
I don't like the fast lane.
Well, I understand that.
Well, can't you just stop it?
I mean, be the guy you used to be.
Talk like you used to talk.
I don't remember how I used to talk.
You don't remember?
Think.
I I remember I was a cute little guy.
I had some kind of an accent.
But I've worked at it so hard I've been doing it for so long, I just don't remember what I used to sound like.
Well, not much different than you do now.
You remember?
Latka Gravas.
: Latka Gravas, Ibeda.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do remember "Latka Gravas, Ibeda".
I'll try it.
Okay, Latka Gravas.
Ibeda.
Oh, it's no use, Alex, I can't cut it.
I can't, I went too far.
I don't remember what I sounded like.
I can't sound like him anymore so this is it.
From here on in, the highway's full of honky-tonks and one-nighters and no place to go when the bars close.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, it doesn't have to be that way.
Oh, come on, cadet, stop the snowfall.
I can take the truth.
Latka, Latka, just calm down.
Don't try so hard.
I mean, just trust that Latka's in there, that he'll come out.
Just trust it and relax.
No way, buddy boy.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Now, remember, Latka was a kind of quiet guy.
Trust me.
Just be quiet, just relax, okay?
Mm-hmm.
Think.
He's in there somewhere?
Right.
Come on, Latka.
Come on out, Latka.
I know you're in there somewhere.
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
All right.
Latka.
Yes, yes, yes.
Good, good, good.
Right, right, right, right, right.
You got it.
: Alex?
Yes, Latka.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Oh, there's so much I want to tell you that has happened to me since I last saw you.
Oh, great, I'd love to hear it, Sit down.
Okay.
Well  Oh, yeah.
: Wasn't that silly?
I remember that.
Yeah?
Playboy.
Oh, yeah.
I'll get us a couple of beers-- I'm listening.
Yeah, well, you know, that was another time.
Oh, well  don't like you.
Well, I'm sorry about that.
Guano, guano  Yeah, well, yeah, here.
Then Thank you very much.
So go ahead, tell me more, tell me more.
Well, that's it.
Oh Then here I am, and here you are.
Well, it's nice to have you back, Latka.
: All right.
: No, no, I'm only fooling.
Where is your sense of humor?
Night, Mr. Walters.
