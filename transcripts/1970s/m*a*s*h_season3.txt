{START OF EPISODE 1}
-  Attention.
- Yeah?
All personnel taking part in the model yacht race report to the cesspool.
- If I weren't so beat, I'd go.
- I didn't know you were interested in model boats.
I'm not, but the beach at the cesspool is so lovely this time of day.
We could hunt for shells.
- Or kidney stones.
- How's it coming?
Two more and my sister's necklace is finished.
- Sirs?
- Radar, you're talking in our sleep.
Colonel Blake says he wants to see youse both on the double.
- It's important.
- Doesn't Henry know it's a holiday?
- Aaron Burr's birthday.
- Who's Aaron Burr?
Aaron Burr, the guy that shot John Wilkes Booth.
"From Major General Bartford Hamilton Steele, U.S.A. "Item one.
All personnel regardless of rank will fall out at 0600 hours daily for one-half hour of calisthenics".
- Calisthenics!
- Henry Calisthenics is a good idea.
We're all in bad condition.
I, for one, am very soft.
Is that true, Frank?
If you'll excuse me, uh, I promised to bless a goat cart.
Some folks down the road are going into business for themselves.
-  "Item two".
- Sir.
I found the calisthenics manual.
- Thank you, Klinger.
- I like your blouse.
- Not too daring?
- A little hairy.
This General Steele seems like a new guy trying to make points.
Another pound of chicken doo.
For your information, Captain, the entire Steele family is in the Encyclopedia Americana!
Oh, it's a very famous Maryland family.
Three brothers, all of'em generals, West Point grads.
One of'em is a U.S. Senator, and one was the first volunteer to be bitten by a mosquito in the Panama Canal.
Bit him right on the locks.
Colonel, is it all right if I go out and start the exercises?
I'm dying to get into a size nine.
Fine, Klinger, just go.
Oh.
Thank you, sir.
At least there's someone around here with a little sanity.
- "Item two".
- Choppers, sir.
What choppers?
Where choppers?
- Mortars, Marty?
- Outside ofTaejon, Trap.
- He's gonna need a ton of blood.
-  Yes, Doctor.
- What's gonna happen to me, Doc?
- Let's go.
You're gonna get a manicure, a hair set and a rinse.
Okay.
Come on.
Watch it.
- Got him?
- Got him.
Lennox Hill Hospital, This kid was a mess.
Gimme some more 0-general silk.
Come on!
Reverse the needle.
Well, you don't have to shout, Doctor.
This kid didn't fall off his bike!
I wanna get him off this table and into the recovery room.
- Take it easy, Hawk.
- He must be 17 years old.
He ought to be in the soda shop, reading dirty magazines.
- How's it going?
- Better.
We got the bleeding stopped.
-  We're closing now.
- Good.
Man, more stuff s coming in from headquarters.
New orders, regulations.
Read that first one, Radar.
Uh, yes, sir.
- "The winners of the model yacht race at the cesspool are" - Not that, Radar.
Let him read it.
I haven't seen a sports page in months.
"First place went to Private Norman Polonsky "with his yacht The American Beauty Dream corncob construction with toilet paper sails".
Ah, that Polonsky has the sea in his blood.
- More 3-0 silk.
- Yes, Doctor.
"Second prize to Corporal Timothy Mclnerny "for his clipper, The Evangeline carved from a pound cake his mother sent him six months ago".
I hope he doesn't invite us for dessert.
"The remainder of the contestants didn't finish due to a sudden undertow after breakfast".
Gimme that, Radar.
I'm tellin' ya, there are gonna be some changes.
Listen to this from General Steele.
"As of this date, uniform regulations will be strictly enforced.
Individual variations will not be tolerated".
Now, some of the stuff you guys are wearing is out.
I mean, it's strictly G.I. From now on.
What's the matter with this guy Steele?
Major Houlihan and I are never out of uniform.
You mean on purpose?
That's it.
Put a dressing on.
- Uh, sir, you're forgetting the biggie.
- What?
- The big one.
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, wait till you hear this, guys.
General Steele is gonna headquarter here for a week.
- Why here?
- For the waters.
He's looking over the area, checking every outfit in l-Corps.
We've gotta shape up.
- The boss is coming to dinner.
- I think I saw this show.
Haircuts, shoes shined, uniforms cleaned and pressed Who's gonna press uniforms?
The motor pool.
They'll run over them a few times.
Hey, come on, troops.
We're on the spot here.
We gotta clean up the whole place.
What about the pigsty we live in?
My part is neat and tidy.
But the other two parties, who shall be nameless, live like swine.
- Pierce.
- Mclntyre.
The Swine brothers.
- Oh, man, Radar, before I forget - Klinger.
- Klinger shouldn't wear dresses, and no skirts.
Yes, sir.
- No dresses.
- Thank you, Nurse.
- You're welcome.
- How's he doing?
- Stable, Doctor.
- Hmm?
- Stable, Doctor.
- All right.
Keep the blood going.
- Yes, Doctor.
Hey, Doc?
Am I gonna have a bad scar?
No, no, you'll have a beauty.
"Z," like Zorro.
Watch it!
Don't laugh for three days.
- How do you feel about Biarritz in June?
- Sorry.
- Baden-Baden in July?
- Uh-uh.
- Monte Carlo in the fall?
- 'Fraid not.
- How about the mattress supply room Thursday night?
- Okay.
I'll bring the saltines.
##  Stay away from my medical magazines, Frank.
I just got 'em.
"TheJoy of Nudity".
Naked people playing volleyball?
Do you participate in this sort of thing?
- It's a tax shelter.
- You can deduct your sneakers and deodorant.
- Disgusting!
- I certainly hope so.
- Hold it, Frank!
- Touch that still, I'll put knots in your dental floss.
Just so it's understood I have no part of it.
Attention.
Attention, please.
- General Steele is arriving at 1000 hours.
- That's only a few minutes.
- Oh, dear!
-  Oh, dear!
Attention, five minutes to General Steele.
- Five minutes.
- ##  ##  Radar!
Radar?
Oh.
I got these new fatigues and cap and everything from the supply sergeant.
Well, how do I look?
- Oh, you look very nice, sir.
- Thank you.
Any tags or anything?
- Hold it.
- What is it?
"Do not remove this tag under penalty of Federal Code 764-J".
Boy, you get me in trouble, and I'm gonna have your keister.
- Yes, sir.
-  Oh, hell!
The kitchen's on fire again.
Sir, it's not the kitchen.
It's General Steele!
He just pulled up.
Mention the tag, and I'll kill you.
- Am I perfect?
I wanna be perfect.
- Wet your lips.
General, sir.
Welcome to MASH 4077 th.
Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake commanding.
Perfect.
Uh, can I help you with the door, General?
I read about these new snaps in the, uh, snap bulletin I got there.
I'm sorry, General.
Sixty-two years old, and fit to play halfback at the Point.
- Hike.
- Right.
Sergeant?
What kind of a formation is this, Colonel?
- Just the gang, sir.
-  Call formation.
- Hmm?
- Have the company fall in.
Right.
Company, fall in.
-  Officers in front - Officers in front.
- Enlisted personnel in the rear.
- Shall we inspect the troops, Colonel?
Right, General.
Radar Uh, after you, General.
At all times.
- Something, General?
- I'm a bit surprised.
Sir, the tag just fell off.
Honest.
- Bear left and a pace behind!
- Yes, sir.
My second-in-command, Major Frank Burns.
Trim the hair in your nose!
Got that, Sergeant Donovan?
- Yes, sir.
- You gave him an "N," General?
Nostril.
I'll know what it means.
Our head nurse, Major Margaret Houlihan, sir.
Gut in, chest out!
Blackjack Pershing, 1915.
- Oh, sir, would you like the sergeant to write that down?
- It isn't noteworthy.
Uh, don't write that down.
He knows what it means.
This is our chaplain, Lieutenant Father Mulcahy.
There are no atheists in foxholes!
I've heard that.
I'd like to see a shine on that cross, Father.
This is my company clerk, Corporal O'Reilly.
The Irish were rotten Indian fighters.
Noncoms.
- The backbone of the service.
Where are you from, son?
- Iowa, sir.
No talking in ranks!
-  Sir!
- Not now, Radar.
- Sir!
- What is it?
Straight ahead at 12:00!
Oh, no.
Not now, Marjorie.
I'm inspecting the troops.
- You needed me for something?
- Yes, Doctor.
Well, I got drafted as soon as I could.
There's been a slight elevation in his temperature.
- Any other problems?
- He's complaining of abdominal pains.
Mm-hmm.
- Hiya, Doc.
- You're supposed to be sick at attention.
-  - Ahh, I told you not to laugh for three days.
- How do you feel?
- So-so.
Stick around.
He could be developing an abscess.
Start him on penicillin.
Right.
Did you get the saltines?
I could only get Ry-Krisp, but I'm salting them down.
- You're very thorough.
- I think you'll find I'm pretty much all business.
- ##  - You got a date tonight?
- You have a fantastic grasp of the obvious.
- Love your uniform.
Surplus, from Montezuma's army.
You better not bump into Henry and that general.
I intend only to bump into Nurse Baker.
Repeatedly, if possible.
You think I made myself too handsome?
I wanna give her a fighting chance.
Hi.
Got you some cheese.
- Oh!
Thank you, Radar.
- Yeah.
When I die, I'm willing you my height.
I'm gonna give you this.
Guess what's in this box.
- Give.
- Something you wanted for tonight.
A dehydrated date.
You add water and there's a girl inside.
- Saltines.
- Radar, you're an exceptional human being.
I snitched those off the cook while he was personally serving General Steele.
Hey, the word's out that general's a little bit "el wacko".
He made me polish the bottom of his boots and put starch in his socks.
Any questions?
-  - You ready?
Got the car ready, Kato?
My hat's off to you, Colonel.
How do you manage pork roast on C rations?
Oh, just lucky, General.
One of our trucks hit a pig.
Beautifully prepared, an apple in its mouth and all.
We don't get any apples, sir.
Uh, that was a baseball painted red.
- What have we here?
- Oh, that's an old tongue depressor, General, sir.
It's military equipment.
You wouldn't carelessly throw away a used rifle, would you?
- Oh, I don't know, sir.
We - This can be cleaned up and used again.
- Waste, waste!
- Well, now, you see, General, that's full of germs.
I don't even know if you can sterilize wood.
Let me put it to you this way.
Have you ever seen a bird get blood poisoning from a white picket fence?
Well, I know so little about birds, sir.
My mother's canary had bronchitis.
It was waste defeated Hannibal at the Battle of Zama.
He was a darky, you know.
- What's that over there, Colonel?
- Officers' quarters, sir.
- And there?
- That's our four-place latrine, sir.
Good thinking.
The men can encourage each other.
- Camaraderie.
- Precisely.
- What's that building, Colonel?
- Storage supply, sir.
- I'd like to see that.
- Yes, sir.
Canary had bronchitis, eh?
He didn't die of it, though.
He fell off his little swing and smashed his bill.
Good.
I hate birds.
Mmm, Hawkeye, what are we doing?
I was hoping you'd know.
Things are happening too fast.
- You wanna stop and have another saltine?
- Hawkeye?
- Yeah?
- Tell me the truth.
Do you respect me?
Do I respect the flag?
Apple pie?
Hamburgers?
The loyalty of a fine dog?
That's all I wanted to know.
This is our supply room, General.
Aw, Pierce!
And after that, Lieutenant, uh, stack the walls and whitewash the mattresses.
Yes, sir.
I don't understand this.
A civilian giving orders to military personnel?
Uh, well, uh, General Steele, sir, uh to tell you the truth, sir, uh, this civilian is, uh B.F. Pierce, sir.
United Press.
- United Press?
- Right.
Ah, a member of the Fourth Estate.
General Bartford Hamilton Steele.
That's three E's, not all in a row.
For the record, you can say that I predict an early end to the war if it doesn't rain and we get all wet.
Make a good story for you.
See me later.
I've got some 8x10 glossies in my portfolio.
One picture's worth a thousand words, General.
The dying utterance of General Custer.
- You going Stateside soon, Mr. Pierce?
- I certainly hope so, General.
- Uh, we all do, sir.
- When you get home, would you call my wife?
- Certainly, General.
- Tell her I'm sending a Jeep for her birthday.
It'll be in a large crate marked "kitchen utensils".
Don't mention that in your article.
Scout's honor.
You might also tell Mrs. Steele the dried prunes are working out fine.
Best thing since the Gatling gun.
As a matter of fact, just talking about it Uh, excuse me, where's the little generals' room?
Oh, that's just outside, sir.
There you go.
First door on the left, sir.
No, no.
That's the wrong You're going into the Ah, fine, sir.
Whatever.
Damn it, Pierce!
You didn't come to formation you didn't come to dinner and then we come in here and find you horsing around with a girl!
Henry, that general is gooney bird.
He's psycho.
Yeah, I know.
How do you figure that?
- I mean, he comes from a fine family.
- Well, so did the Borgias.
Henry, it's got germs on it.
I mean, you're in civvies, United Press.
What am I gonna do?
Have a saltine.
Nine.
Gimme a break.
I'm starvin'.
-  Ten.
- And this is our little officers' club, General Steele.
Although we allow anyone in, except the enemy, of course.
-  - Hi, Henry.
Uh, General, this is Captain Mclntyre, one of our really fine surgeons.
- Surgeon.
Doctor, eh?
- Not yet.
My brother contacted yellow fever during the digging of the Panama Canal.
- You should've called me sooner, sir.
- Good pretzels.
Thank you.
Uh, sir, this is Warrant Officer Martin Williams one of the best chopper pilots in the theater.
- General.
- Williams.
- Well, General, care for a little drink?
- War and whiskey don't mix.
General Grant kept throwin' up on his bugler.
Chopper pilot, eh?
- Yes, General.
- How far is it to the front, Williams?
- Twenty minutes, General.
- And what is your fuel consumption?
Twenty gallons an hour, General.
Waste, waste, waste!
We're gonna have to move your unit closer to the front, Colonel.
Where the guys are fighting, sir?
"You do your best business on Main Street".
General Cornwallis.
It's not all that pleasant being on the 50-yard line, General.
- It's very dangerous, sir.
- Danger is our business.
Get your second-in-command, and we'll find a new location.
MASH means Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, and mobile you shall be!
Sir.
Sir, that'll mean tearing down the tents, the buildings.
We'll have to pack everything up.
I mean, we've been here a long time.
We fixed it up so nice.
I mean, gee whiz, just last week the nurses planted radishes.
"A radish will never stand in the way of victory".
Marshal Foch.
Moving the hospital closer to combat?
Now I know he's crazy.
He's a fruitcake.
He's got raisins for eyes.
History shows that most great military minds border on the eccentric.
- You gotta jump me.
- I don't want to.
-  - Life in the big city.
That general is nuts!
I've seen that look in every Hitchcock movie.
Can you still see the hair in my nose?
Uh-huh, but it's parted on the wrong side.
I never realized I had so much hair up there.
I did.
I just thought it was an ingrown mustache.
Come on, Frank.
The general wants to go look for the new hospital site.
- Henry, you're not really gonna let this guy move us?
- He'll get us killed!
Well, what am I supposed to do?
He's a two-star general.
But he's a three-star loony.
He is nuts, isn't he?
Is Bismarck a herring?
- Henry.
- Yeah?
What if you just disobeyed him?
I can't disobey an order.
I mean, unless somebody gives me an order to do it.
- Terrific.
-  - Come on, let's not keep dingdong waiting.
- Geronimo!
Well, you can see for yourselves, gentlemen.
This is a much more desirable location.
Good water supply.
Flat ground, easier logistics.
This is it.
We move tomorrow.
That's an order.
- Whatever you say, General.
- Aren't we forgetting something, Colonel?
- General?
- You accepted an order.
That requires a salute.
Uh, saluting isn't advisable around here, sir.
No, sir.
There are snipers.
And they could see that you're the higher ranking officer.
Pish tosh!
Let me have it.
-  - Well, we can stand and fight or we can have lunch.
- Lunch!
- Lunch!
Yeah, I'm a little hungry myself.
# I love a parade # #The beat of the drums Dah, dah, dah, dum # # I love ## They can do more for you down in Seoul.
I'll send you my bill later.
Don't laugh.
- Land soft, Marty.
- Gotcha.
- Hold that chopper!
- I got an emergency.
That patient's going to Seoul.
I need that chopper!
I wish to use it to observe the move!
Sorry, General.
Go!
- You bring that chopper back down here!
- Too late, General.
- You're insubordinate!
You're insolent!
- Right!
Right!
And you're nuts!
All right.
This preliminary hearing is now in order.
- General?
- Thank you, Colonel Atkins.
I'll make this as brief as possible so we can get on with movin'this unit.
- Charges.
- "Re: Captain Benjamin" Get on with the charges!
Charges.
"Insubordination.
Disobedience of orders.
- Impersonating a civilian".
- Thought I forgot about you in the storage room, didn't you?
It was a night I'll never forget.
I'd like to interrogate the first witness, Colonel.
- By your leave, General.
- "Warrant Officer Martin H. Williams".
- Yes, General.
- I want you to know there are no charges against you.
You simply obeyed the orders of a superior.
The sign of a good soldier.
Now, feel at ease.
Just tell in your own words the incident at the helicopter pad yesterday at 0900 hours.
But first, a number.
Sir?
You know, a musical number.
Well, you've got it in your blood, boy.
Just let it out.
#When the sun goes down the tide goes out # #The darkies stand around and they all begin to shout # # Hey, hey, Uncle Fud It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud # #Hey, hey, Uncle Fud It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud # #It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud # #What a dance they all do # # Lordy, they all dance for you # ## - I take it we don't have to leave?
- Only the general does.
In a rubber truck.
- ##  - Hey, Trap.
Look at this one playin' basketball.
Not a bad hook shot for a girl.
Hey, did you guys read Stars and Stripes today?
What, Henry?
"General Bartford Hamilton Steele has been promoted to three-star general "for meritorious service in Korea.
"His new assignment is the Pentagon where he will be in charge of operations for the entire Asian theater".
Hmph!
And you all thought he was crazy.
Crazy?
A three-star general?
Hit it!
#When the sun goes down and the tide goes out # #They all gather round and they all begin to shout #  # Hey, hey, on my way # #What a dance they may do # # Lordy, how ##
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}

No polish.
- You have very strong hands, sir.
- Oh, thank you, Klinger.
My father gave them to me for graduation.
He had to.
Mom gave me a pen and pencil set.
I sure wish I was going with you.
Tokyo's the greatest.
Yeah.
In just a few short hours, these hands will be hopelessly in love with some young lady of the geisha persuasion.
- Mm, that runs into money.
- No, not really.
A full evening with a Japanese hostess comes to only about $30.
Of course, batteries are extra.
Very nice.
You really do a good job, Klinger.
Well, I'm not just another pretty face.
Mmm.
You're a rat for not taking me to Tokyo with you.
I'm a married man, honey.
I only go out with girls who don't know that.
Hmph.
They're off again.
Only one thing on their pleasure-depraved minds: - Debauchery, lust.
- What was that, Frank?
Fine ambassadors for the medical profession.
First they'll check into some sleazy little hotel probably shower, freshen up.
Like people of that type do.
And then they'll go down to the bar a dark little pickup place, and there'll be those girls with tight satin skirts perched up on high bar stools with their legs crossed and these two lechers will slither up to them and, you know.
What, Frank?
What do I know?
Hey, what are you going to miss around here the least?
I think looking down and seeing a rat using my shoelace for dental floss.
You?
Be nice to go for three days without amputating anything.
Ah.
Three days without shaking hands with somebody's gall bladder.
For your divine help in granting us this sabbatical we give thanks, O Lord.
You rang?
I didn't know he made house calls.
Well, Tokyo, here you come, I see.
- We're off to see the wizard.
- And who's that?
How do we know?
We haven't met her yet.
I hate to interfere with your rest and relaxation  but I do have a short shopping list from some of the gang.
And of course the filthy lucre to pay for same.
- What do we got here?
- Oh, the usual cameras, lenses, watches.
A training bra?
- Can't be for anybody we know.
- Klinger.
Understandably, there's some gaps in my education.
What exactly is a training bra?
Just like an ordinary one, only it has two little wheels in back.
Well, have a nice trip, boys.
Be good.
And if you can't be good, be careful.
Aren't we lucky to have such a nice Father?
It's for the trip.
Oh, I thought you were signaling a left and a right turn.
I'll have to remember that.
Why don't you watch where the hell Oh, I'm sorry, Father.
I thought you were a regular person.
Quite all right.
Are you guys going to be at the Daichi Hotel?
I may have to call you in case things start jumping back here at the ranch.
We're kind of off the Daichi, Henry.
Too near the railroad.
Noisy.
They asked you not to come back, right?
They said we were too loud.
Some of the guests complained they couldn't hear the railroad.
Either of you clowns know Yamashida Street in Tokyo?
Yeah, sure.
It runs parallel to the Ginza.
That's right.
There's a Japanese restaurant right on the corner.
Hey, how about that?
They've got a Japanese restaurant in Tokyo.
And there's a book shop next door.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Now, they've got this package for me.
Just give 'em this, 34 bucks, and say you're Orville Carver.
Who's Orville Carver, Henry?
Well, they think I am.
But they've never seen me so they'll think either one of you guys is.
What's What's in the package, Henry?
Japanese prints.
Old ones.
I mean, some things never change.
If you get my drift.
Henry, you have all the subtlety of a community bedpan.
- Just get the prints.
- Excuse me, sirs.
You got a shopping list, Radar?
You want us to buy you a new pair of glasses at the dime store?
How about another pair of Dr. Dentons?
- I hear they came out with a new power flap.
- Sign here, Colonel.
Radar, I spent the entire morning signing my name.
Why didn't you have me sign this while I was signing all those other things I was signing my name to, which I didn't know - why I was signing them either.
- Signing.
Sir, this is new business.
A whole truckload of plasma just rolled in.
Ah, great!
Terrific.
Every time we get a truckload of plasma, we get a truckload of wounded to pump it into.
Let's go, Radar.
We'll have a bunch of shot-up kids showing up soon.
Won't need this.
Better suit up, guys.
Whatever you say, Orville.
Come on.
Close that.
Please remember the sponge count, girls.
- You too, Mr. Kwang.
- Yes, Major.
I should be in Tokyo now up to my pectorals in warm water surfacing only occasionally to be fed raw fish by a pretty little "Orienta".
- Give me the heavier silk.
- I'm sorry, Doctor.
Here.
Boy, I'd sure love to send my hips out for a walk.
Let's go, Nurse.
Don't make a big thing out of this.
-  Okay, wrap this one to go, Mr. Kwang.
- Yes, Doctor.
Hello, toots.
What are you doing after the war?
Don't be a wise guy, sir.
Hiya.
This guy's got a simple laceration.
He can wait.
I'm closing a routine flesh wound here.
- Henry, who's on triage?
- Hold it.
I've got a bowel that's talking back to me here.
- Here.
- I didn't ask for this.
- I thought you would need it.
- Then I probably do.
- Frank volunteered.
- Figures.
Frank would volunteer for a firing squad.
- Or to be in front of it.
- Or both.
Colonel, I protest this attack on Major Burns' character in his absence.
Actually, we're attacking his absence of character.
No kidding, Henry.
We got to start getting our casualties in here in the right priority.
- No question.
- You can do this, Major.
- I'm not sterile.
- Congratulations.
Okay, men.
Hustle, hustle, hustle.
Let's move it.
Let's move it.
And back here on the double!
Father, this is a medical situation.
We're busy in here.
Oh, I'm just wetting his lips, Major.
- Well, wet 'em somewhere else.
- Frank, what are you doing?
What do you mean?
I'm doing my duty, that's what I'm doing.
Oh, really?
Got a good ingrown toenail case?
Anybody with adenoids?
Diaper rash?
Get off this bus, Captain.
The purpose of triage, Major, is to select patients for immediate surgery.
Oh, you teaching me medicine now?
That's rich.
Why do you keep sending us cases that can wait?
Now, listen, hotshot.
I'm a pretty fair doctor myself.
- Ask any of my patients.
- We can't dig people up just for that.
This man's got a chest wound.
He ought to be in O.R. Right now.
He happens to be Chinese.
Then we'll operate with chopsticks.
- Corpsman, get this guy inside.
- Now, don't you dare, and that's an order.
I'm busy now, Frank.
I'll take your order later.
I remind you, Captain Pierce, army standard triage procedure is as follows: American wounded first, allies second, enemy last repeat, last.
Frank, that man is bleeding more than anybody in here with the possible exception of your nose if you don't get out of my way.
Let's go.
Get him inside.
What you're doing is mutiny.
I'm in command of this bus.
Mutiny on the Bus It was a B-movie.
They couldn't afford a bounty.
Allen Jenkins played the bus driver.
Attention, all personnel.
Battle action has terminated.
No incoming wounded.
Colonel Blake commends the unit and invites everyone to have a drink Dutch treat.
- Hawk, coffee's up.
- Fine.
Pour it in my ear.
- Come on.
- Don't want any.
I'll take two lumps with mine.
Ahh.
I got a casualty count before we left O.R. You want to know how many cases we handled in the last 36 hours?
No, not really.
an all-timer.
We did, um, 18 laporotomies, - 16 bowel resections - Captain, can we put a lid on the shop talk, please?
You know, for once I agree with him.
- I said that.
- I know.
Let me have some more of that sugar, only this time no coffee.
- I've got to talk to y'all.
- Sorry, Henry.
We've thought it over, and we're quitting.
Yeah, we got a better offer from another war Saturdays and Sundays off, and we don't have to do windows.
- Read this.
- Read this.
Read this.
Well, blow my nose.
Colonel, is this true?
Radar took the call.
It came in on the radio.
It's from the Chinese.
The Chinese called us?
They're probably dying for some American takeout food.
No, they've got nine shot-up G.I. S on their side of the line and they need more attention than the Chinese can handle.
So they're willing to have us come and get 'em.
Here are the conditions one vehicle, driver, doctors, corpsmen only.
No guns, not even sidearms.
The pickup point is a place called Rainbow Bridge.
It's 50 miles inside their territory.
- It's a trap!
- Absolutely.
They're savages.
I say we should go.
When are you going to learn about Chinese treachery?
Didn't Pearl Harbor teach you anything?
It could be a trap, Trap.
Oh, yes.
Well, I'm afraid this is what you call your command decision.
It's "lonely at the top" time.
Strictly something for your leader.
- Well, Henry?
- Oh, golly.
Whatever you people decide is fine with me.
- Have a drink.
-  Wait.
Just a minute.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
We are all doctors, with one notable exception.
We have no choice but to go pick them up.
He's right.
The Chinese have no antibiotics no real surgical setup.
Their way of treating a simple fracture is by amputation.
Well, boo-hoo for the Chinese.
They're pretty clever when they want to be.
They invented gunpowder, spaghetti, pigtails Little Feet for Women, by Louisa May Alcott.
The major's point is that they're trying to suck us into a situation - and set us up for a wipeout.
- Spaghetti?
A map of Rainbow Bridge, sir.
- There it is in blue.
- Right next to Boardwalk and Park Place.
This thing here that looks like somebody's belly is China.
That can't be 20 miles from their border.
Jumpin' butterballs.
Right in the middle of the yellow horde's ball park.
-  Frank?
- Hmm?
If you say "yellow horde" one more time while the war is still in motion I'm gonna cut out your tongue and use it for a pen wiper.
You still won't face reality, will you?
Perfect ambush country.
Knock a few MASH doctors off and break down the morale of our brave freckle-faced kids at the front.
Can I please say something?
- Anything but "yellow horde".
- That's his.
I'm not unfamiliar with the Chinese approach to war.
Her father fought in France in World War I. Ambush to one side, I think we must consider the possibility of capture torture, brainwashing and, yes, even rape.
- Rape a doctor?
- I'll hit him with my purse.
Radar, could I get a cup of coffee, please?
Yes, Colonel.
Anybody else?
How about you, ma'am, sir?
I don't know.
Going up there without any protection might just be asking for it.
We know the Chinese are more decent with our wounded than the North Koreans.
- Yeah, they know we give their wounded a break.
- I think it's a real offer.
Yeah, but if it's not, if you guys get killed I'll never hear the end of it.
Cream without sugar.
Sugar without cream.
And black without cream and no sugar.
Henry?
Radar, I'll need a driver and a corpsman.
- Volunteers, sir?
- Thank you, Radar.
I knew I could count on you.
Colonel Blake, I would like to go on record - We would.
- That's right.
She and me.
We.
You have made a disastrous decision.
What do you want?
It's his first one.
He'll get better.
Henry.
-  Uh, sir?
- Yo.
Uh, excuse me, but I think you volunteered me a little quick there.
They're a pair of fools for going.
Grandstand play, that's what it is.
- Mock heroics.
- I've never seen anything "mocker".
Then again Can I be frank, Frank?
I feel that if we absolutely have to, we can be honest with each other.
Then I think you should consider going along.
It could mean a citation, maybe even a promotion.
But, uh, what about the danger?
I've got to be honest I'm afraid of death.
Nobody's crazy about it, Frank.
But sometimes it's necessary.
There is another consideration: I'm a married man.
No kidding?
I'd forgotten.
You haven't mentioned her for three or four hours.
Talking about my wife is really hitting me below the belt at a time like this.
Frank, there isn't a man in this war who isn't afraid.
Including me.
But what you've got to do is harness that great mass of cowardly energy you have.
Margaret, you're so good for me.
You just have to talk, and it gets my gumption up.
You're just a big grown-up boy, aren't you?
- Take a gun along, Frank.
- What?
- Just in case.
- But they said not to, not even sidearms.
Who said, Frank?
The Chinese?
Are we taking orders from the Chinese now, Frank?
It was my mother's.
Dad gave it to her on their wedding night.
He must have loved her very much.
"To my little shot from her big shot.
"Your loving husband Lt.
Colonel Alvin F. Houlihan, regular army".
Keep it hidden, Frank.
Nobody has to know.
If I shouldn't come back, l Kiss me, Frank.
You'd better put the gun on safety.
Come on, George.
How we doin', Trap?
We got a ton of stuff.
We could stay on the road for weeks.
Suits me.
I don't want to open on Broadway until we're ready.
Just stay on this route, Radar, and nothing will happen to you.
- Yes, sir.
- You're gonna be fine, Radar.
The Chinese are very fond of miniatures.
Cut it out, sir!
I'm no scareder than you are!
Corporal Klinger, volunteering for corpsman duty, sir.
- Really, Klinger?
-  Terrific.
What the hell?
Maybe I can get out for bravery.
I'm sure not making it for "nuts-ery".
Come on.
I'll show you the map.
Hypocrites at 3:00, over.
Colonel Blake.
Major Burns is here to volunteer for this extremely dangerous and patriotic mission.
- Is that right, Frank?
- You heard me.
Welcome aboard, Frank.
We knew you'd want to be where the action is, ya big monkey.
If I don't come back, honey, be sure that our son Henry gets a good education.
Oh Stop it!
As for me, I think Ralph Bellamy said it best when he said "If I can't get the girl, at least get me more money".
Time's wasting, guys.
- Good luck.
- I'm not going.
Hold it, boys!
Just want to wish you all the best.
- Right on the ball.
- Lord, bless this mission of mercy.
Protect these brave men and return them safely with their charges, amen.
- Thanks, Father.
- He's really very good, isn't he?
- Tops.
- I feel guilty.
We tried to get Pat O'Brien.
-  -  Roll 'em!
## # Oh, Tokyo # #They got some sake and sashimi and some clean sheets # # Oh, come on, oh Come on, oh # # Come on, oh # # Tokyo's the town that I love the best # #East, maybe east and west maybe west # #Forget about the twain It'll drive you insane # #And teach you things you never knew before #  Okay, keep your eyes open.
We're getting close.
Okay, stop, stop.
I think our table is ready.
Radar, you and Klinger hang back.
Those are Russian burp guns.
They fire - Thank you, Dr. Morale.
- It's a good thing I brought a piece.
- Piece of what, Frank?
- A gun, ya jerk.
I got it stuck in my belt.
Frank, if they find that gun on you, they're gonna play mah-jongg with our teeth later.
Frank, are you out of what's left of your mind?
Now, if they start anything, I'll take out the officer - and you disarm the ones with the guns.
-  Bite your Mao Tse-tung.
- Keep it out of sight.
- I'd like to see my wife again.
I'd like to see anybody's wife again.
I'm Dr. Lin Tan, Army of the People's Republic.
I'm-I'm Dr. Pierce.
- Uh, Dr. Burns.
- Dr. Maclntryre.
Uh, we're doctors too all three of us we three.
Hi.
Here's a list of your wounded.
All require more medical attention than we can provide.
- You speak very good English, Doctor.
- University of Illinois.
No kidding?
Our commanding officer went to Illinois.
There's no need for us to get friendly here.
Uh, Henry Blake.
Uh, about 6'3" narrow shoulders, big hips, sort of shaped like a pear.
We'd better do it.
If you have observed our conditions, the procedure is as follows: You will bring your vehicle across bridge slowly.
-  -  - Frank!
- Come on, let's have it.
- Have what?
Give it to them, Frank, before they give us a.32-caliber enema.
What's the matter with you guys?
You gonna side with me or the R-E-D?
Frank, the R-E-D speaks English better than Y-O-U do.
You have violated the agreed conditions.
Your wounded will remain with us.
- Doctor, hold it!
- Wait a minute!
Look, you're doing something decent in the middle of a giant indecency.
Don't endanger nine men just because some idiot wants to do his General Custer impersonation.
Yeah, Doctor.
Don't blow it now.
Is it not enough that your planes harass us day and night?
It makes it impossible for me to treat my own people.
We make a civilized gesture, and you respond by coming here with a gun ready to shoot us down.
All right, Frank.
Come on, give it up.
What the hell is that?
Comes in a box of CrackerJacks.
It's also a whistle.
Radar, Klinger, come on!
Get up there and get some, will you, Frank?
Okay.
-  Frank, come on.
- Yeah, all right.
# Oh, Tokyo # #They got some sake and sashimi # #And some clean sheets # # Oh, come on, oh # Boy, I don't mind telling you now, boy I was really scared on that bridge.
I hear if they take you prisoner, they hit you in places that are better left un-hit.
Oh, you guys were really great with those casualties, though.
You know, I was thinking I'd like to be a doctor when I get back to the real world.
But I don't like being around sick people that much, so I guess that would be a drawback.
I'm, uh, packing your pajamas.
Maybe I shouldn't even bother, huh?
You guys are really something.
I don't know how you do it.
I mean, 16 hours of surgery A trip to the bridge and back, and now you're going to Tokyo.
Well if you ask me, you guys are like Supermen.
You're all set.
Good night, Supermen.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
##  ##  ##  Fire ceremonial salute.
- But, sir, the angle - Fire the salute, Private!
Yes, sir.
-  - Ow!
- What the What did he do?
-  Corporal, a little decorum, please!
You I'm all right.
Let me down.
I'm all right.
I'm okay.
Ooh!
Company order arms!
- The company's arms are ordered, sir.
- We're at order arms.
Excuse me.
Now then, during Colonel Blake's absence, I will act in his capacity.
So, if there are any problems, you may bring them to me or to our fine adjutant here, Major Houlihan.
Talking to the major is the same as talking to me since we are intimate with each other at all times.
Company inspection arms!
Uh-huh.
- You shave today, soldier?
- Yes, sir.
Well, tomorrow try it with a blade in the razor.
- I want this man on report, Corporal.
- Uh, what's the charge, sir?
Heavy beard in combat zone.
Aah!
- Are you all right, sir?
-  - Fingernail polish?
- Flame d'Amour, sir.
- And earrings?
- They match the ring, sir.
I'm a symphony in coordination.
High heels?
You're a disgrace to American man- and womanhood.
So stop bucking for a discharge while I'm in command, Corporal Nutsy Fagin!
- You're not getting out of this man's army.
- At least give me a pass, sir.
I'd like to spend a little time with people.
- Request denied.
- Please, sir.
I'd like to be in Seoul for Mother's Day.
- No!
- Father's Day?
I'll wear something tailored.
I said no!
Corporal, make a note.
I want this creature's dresses his entire wardrobe and all that stuff burned!
Burned?
Sir, a man has a right to his own trousseau!
Shut up!
Now, that concludes our fine little retreat ceremony and inspection.
I hope you've enjoyed it as much as I've enjoyed inspecting you.
I'm going off duty now, and your officer of the day will be - Corporal, do you have - I have the roster notes right here, sir.
The officer of the day will be Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce.
Captain Pierce?
Good.
Captain Pierce, step forward.
Captain Pierce.
- Hi, Frank.
- That doesn't scare me one bit.
Is he sleeping again?
No, Frank.
He heard so much about rigor mortis, he thought he would try it.
- Wake up, Pierce!
-  - Come on!
Get up!
- Hey, Frank, lay off.
He was 14 hours in O.R. Tough tilly.
Up, up, up!
Get lost, Frank.
Go rinse out the flag.
Trap, you're a witness.
He's violating the dead.
- Pull yourself together, mister.
- Breakfast?
My kidneys were expecting orange juice.
Silly kidneys.
Smooth.
This morning was a very good year.
I dreamed I was walking along the beach with my mother.
There was this giant, bleached-out Frank Burns lying on the sand its white belly shining in the sun.
- Pierce.
- I said, "Mommy, can I touch it"?
And she said, "Be careful, son.
The dullness rubs off".
Very amusing.
- Pierce, you're officer of the day.
- I pass.
- Give it to somebody else.
- You're it, and that's an order.
Here's your arm band and log book.
Here's your belt, holster and sidearm.
There's also a sash and sword that goes with it.
That's in case we're attacked by the Saracens.
Or you have to do a tall appendectomy.
I will not carry a gun, Frank.
When I got into this war, I had a very clear understanding with the Pentagon.
- No guns.
- Hmm!
I'll carry your books, I'll carry a torch I'll carry a tune, I'll carry on, carry over, carry forward Cary Grant, cash and carry carry me back to old Virginia, I'll even "hari-kari," if you show me how but I will not carry a gun!
All right, Captain 'Fraidy Cat.
- You have your orders, mister.
- Bye, Frank.
That was totally uncalled for.
Emptiest holster in the West.
I do believe it's a new sheriff in town.
That's right, stranger.
And I'm gonna make everybody in this town do just what I want 'em to do.
I think I'll start with the girls.
As of 1600 hours, sir, all secure.
Very good, Radar.
Your report is concise, informative and makes no sense whatsoever.
Thank you, sir.
Any orders, sir?
Yes, take an order.
All the troops can go home.
I'm declaring peace and a general amnesty.
- Aw, come on, Hawk.
- You're free too.
I'll give you ten bucks and a new suit later.
Well, I'm gonna need your signature on this.
I'm not signing anything.
You're not putting the war in my name.
For all I know, Henry didn't keep up the payments.
What's this job like?
I'm a new man here.
I been working down in sales.
Well, you just have to be on duty in case stuff happens inspect the place, do a bed check.
You probably wanna handle that personally.
You can inspect the nurses' showers.
I didn't give you a birthday present.
Yes, sir.
Privates Carter and Willis reporting, sir.
Guard needs to be changed, sir.
Okay.
Change 'em and get 'em out of here.
Uh, sir.
They need to know the password.
I would certainly think so.
What was it yesterday?
- Betty Boop.
- I like it.
An unpretentious little password, but it's got sex.
- Betty Boop.
- Why get off a winner?
Orders for the guards, sir?
Be brave, be loyal, be true.
- And keep your white flags handy just in case.
- Dismissed!
Good night, guards.
Sleep well.
Sir.
Sir?
- Sir.
- Go away, Radar.
- You're not 'upposed to go to sleep.
- I'm not sleeping.
I'm inspecting the inside of my eyelids.
Business, sir.
Local indigenous personnel requesting medical attention.
- This is his I.D. Card.
-  "Kim Luck.
Age 42 Hello.
Looks like an axe wound.
Might need a stitch or two.
Take Mr. Luck to the hospital, and ask the duty nurse to fix him up.
- Tetanus shot.
- This way, please.
Harry Truman number one G.I. Joe.
I'll tell him you stopped by.
Sounds like somebody's pulled up to our gas pumps.
- Where the hell is everybody?
Hit it again, Sergeant.
-   Knock it off.
You'll wake up the war.
Well, look who's here Colonel Flagg, our friendly, undercover, overanxious intelligence man.
Do I know you?
And don't try to deny it.
Of course you know me.
Olivia de Havilland.
- Perkins.
Captain Perkins.
- Pierce.
- That's what I said Captain Pierce.
- Right.
Perkins.
Four, maybe five months ago, here on an investigation, right?
Right.
We still have one of your hidden mikes in our latrine.
We thought we'd make an album for you.
I got a wounded gook here.
You got a wounded person here.
Who wounded him?
I did.
Somehow that figured.
He's in shock.
You do nice work.
Stretcher case, on the double.
- He's a civilian.
- He's North Korean Army.
Caught him near an ammo dump.
Taking him to Seoul.
If he's still breathing, you are.
We stopped on the road, he ran and I put a couple into him.
- Of course you did.
How could you resist?
- Patch him up fast, Doc.
Prep him for surgery.
Start him on plasma, stat.
About a two-inch cuff on the pants.
Will be just as you like it, Capitan.
- Plenty of room in the seat.
- Hey, Hawk.
- His brains have to breathe.
- This is Mr. Yu, the tailor.
Captain Pierce.
- Honored, sir.
- Honored.
May your needle be true and your flies always straight.
Two pair of pants and a vest, 12 bucks.
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with a single-breasted Kleenex.
Oh, that should bag up nicely.
I need you.
- Flagg is here Army Intelligence.
- That's a contradiction in terms.
He's got a wounded North Korean prisoner, prepped and ready.
Hawk, I'm with my tailor.
Get Frank.
Frank is off duty, which helps keep down the mortality rate.
- Hold it.
- Those are Mr. Yu's boys.
Marshall and Elroy.
I know these two claw machines.
They were here a couple of months ago.
- They stole a 20-pound ham.
- They didn't?
- And the refrigerator it was stored in.
- Those two kids?
Their pictures are in the post office in the juvenile section.
All right.
Unload, men.
Unpocket yourselves.
Come on.
Are you their real father or did they steal you?
The pinstripe.
I'll take it.
Sister Klinger?
Pressing a little, aren't we?
- Sir, I caught him trying to sneak out of camp.
- I was out for a walk.
- Looking for an all-night novena?
- I just wanted to get to Seoul for a few days, sir.
What are you trying to do to me, Klinger?
I'm officer of the day.
- You go AWOL, they hang it on me.
- Sorry, sir.
"While officer of the day, Captain Pierce did allow hairy nun to desert".
How'd you like that on your record?
Sir, I wouldn't care if my record said I was a bedbug.
Slip into something secular and stay put.
If I don't get some time off, I'm gonna stick my nose into a chopper blade.
When the colonel comes back, I'll ask him about a pass for you.
Bless you, sir.
Klinger?
Love your beads.
Any calls for me while I was in?
Somebody said we could have this.
Oh, really?
Somebody?
You kids are gonna have to stop stealing.
Why don't you go to bars and roll an officer like other children?
Go on.
Come on.
What's up, Radar?
Well, indigenous personnels again, sir, requesting medical attention.
- That's his I.D. Card.
- What, did we advertise a weekend special?
Kim Luck?
That's the second one we had today.
That's the way it runs sometimes, sir.
Can you identify yourself?
This is me.
Well, I guess you wouldn't kid me about a thing like that.
- Bring him to the hospital.
- Yes, sir.
This must be our Kim Lucky day.
This way.
I don't like people kibitzing when I operate.
- I didn't ask you.
- That's why I'm answering.
Just do your job, I'll do mine, mister.
You're not gonna get anywhere being a softie.
- What's he gowning up for?
- Says he has to watch.
We'll let you know if we find any microfilm in the kid's bladder.
I'm only gonna say this once.
That's my prisoner.
Where he goes, I go.
You read me?
- Like a cheap novel.
- Just stitch him up.
I want him put together and put together fast.
Your concern is touching.
I have to get to Seoul so we can execute him over the weekend.
Save the kid's life so you can take it away from him?
You got it.
- Nice.
- Beautiful.
- War.
- Stinks.
Will you believe me?
You got the wrong number.
-  - One second.
I can't give you an infantry charge.
We're only doctors.
The best we can do is storm the enemy and take their tonsils out.
Come.
How did he try it this time?
Pretending to be a business girl.
Klinger.
Klinger, where did your mother and I go wrong?
How's he doing?
What's the matter?
Afraid he'll die and ruin your weekend?
Forceps.
Forceps.
One of your slugs for your charm bracelet.
All right.
Saline for irrigation.
Come on.
Saline.
I was just checking for centipedes.
Just look for a lot of little house slippers.
Sir, do you mind if we close those doors?
Don't be antisocial, Radar.
Good night.
He belonged to my brother.
And he left it to you when he went off to war?
No, he was 4F.
He was a box boy in a supermarket.
Well, they also serve who stand and stuff.
Would you mind turning your head, please?
Radar, I'm a doctor.
I've seen more behinds than you'll ever have.
Gee, I don't think it's too much to ask for one guy to ask another guy to turn his head.
Your modesty is almost indecent.
Well, if you're a doctor like you say then you don't need to see any more than you've seen.
Go ahead, get sore.
I love it when those little wisps of steam come out of your tiny ears.
Sir?
There's a lady out there.
Yes, ma'am?
Number one pain here.
Boy, this card's getting a workout today.
Radar?
- Sir?
- We're being Kim Lucked again.
Would you take this lady inside, please?
Yes, sir.
Come.
Move him?
In that condition?
Are you out of your sadomasochistic mind, sir?
- Okay.
When?
- Well, that's hard to say very hard.
Dr. Pierce here has had a lot of experience in moving patients that are about to be executed.
It was my postgraduate specialty Blindfold and Last Cigarette 102.
All right.
Sign him out, put him on a stretcher.
I'll take the responsibility.
- Uh, we'll have to confer on that.
- Yeah, we'll only be a minute.
Amuse yourself take some fingerprints, break somebody on the rack.
I'd like to fix him a ground glass burger.
We are not going to let him take that 16-year-old kid to Seoul and put him against the wall.
- I'm with you, Rocky.
- Stall?
Big.
Big stall.
Uh, Colonel, there's a medical consideration which supersedes the military.
That man is still unconscious.
We can't release him in that condition.
He could sleep through the whole execution.
That wouldn't be any fun.
I want to talk to your commanding officer.
You gonna execute him instead?
Tough luck.
He's down in Tokyo attending a series of medical conferences.
And dodging hotel dicks.
Where can I reach him?
You could try Madame Chang's Whoopee Parlor.
Or in the Pachinko Palace.
He's in the semifinals.
Couple of cutie pies, ain't you?
- Thank you.
- Who's your second in command?
- Uh, Major Frank Burns, M.D. - Manic-depressive.
It's an honorary title.
He's also schizoid.
Sleeps in two bunks.
You clowns are pushing me around pretty good, cooperation-wise.
Not to mention wise-guy-wise.
If I lay a charge of obstructing military justice on you you're gonna have a snootful of trouble.
What could they do?
Send us to the front?
We're at the front.
Maybe they'll put us in front of the front.
Hawkeye, can I see you?
Uh, sir, it's important.
What's wrong, Radar?
Your slight but sturdy body is all atremble.
Well, you know who I mean, what I sleep with?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Well, it's gone.
I've looked everywhere.
Sir, you gotta help me find it.
Have no fear, Radar.
We'll look in every tent.
- We'll conduct a louse-to-louse search.
-  Hold it!
You gonna sign out my prisoner?
Colonel, I have a more important problem on my hands one of our teddy bears is missing.
Look.
I didn't mind when you tried to steal the telephone.
And I was rather pleased when you tried to make off with 100 pounds of saltpeter.
But this is going too far.
Now where is it?
You are being foolish.
We have ways of making you talk.
Pierce, I want a word with you!
- Radar, take 'em downtown and book 'em.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Come on!
Captain Pierce, Major Burns would like to talk to you as acting commander.
- Good.
I'll act like I'm listening.
- He went and got 'em, Hawk.
I bet he found 'em double-parked in an erogenous zone.
Oh!
What a mouth!
Just you never mind where we were, Nosey Nate!
Captain Pierce, Major Burns, Acting Commander and I, his adjutant, have been informed that you and Captain Mclntyre refuse to release Colonel Flagg's prisoner.
Meanwhile, Aunt Martha, having taken a tramp in the woods is lying in a ditch at the edge of town.
A dozen medical units, I have to pull into a funny farm.
Your kid's too sick to travel.
- He could die between here and Seoul.
- I'll take that chance.
- Oh, he'll take that chance.
- Nice.
Colonel Flagg's prisoner is a spy!
You have no right to interfere!
While we're on spies, ask the major about the secret pocket in her garter belt.
If I didn't hate violence, I'd kick you.
Would you?
With high heels?
Get off the pot, Major.
Lean on 'em.
Yes.
Right.
All right.
Now hear this!
I order you to sign.
Sorry, we can't take any new orders till after Christmas.
You can't disobey him!
He's a major!
Oh, uh, just a minute, just a minute.
He's only got two clusters.
Between us two captains, we've got eight bars.
We outrank you by half a chorus.
Major Burns, I just thought of something.
Besides being acting commander, you are also a doctor.
Hey, that's right.
Frank's a doctor.
How about that, Hawk?
Your secret is safe with us, you son of a gun.
Certainly your patients will never know.
- You can release the prisoner.
- I can?
Oh, I can.
Except that I can't.
Now, this requires two doctors' signatures.
- Oh, no, forget it.
- Two.
Right!
- I have had it with you fruitcakes!
-  Now that's my boy in that hospital.
I caught him and he's mine.
I'm taking him to Seoul.
Okay, you got your body, Flagg.
It's your war, not mine.
This'll teach you eggheads not to screw around with intelligence.
Corpsmen!
I promised him a trip to Seoul.
The North Korean prisoner suspected of espionage, recovering satisfactorily will be turned over to military intelligence as soon as somebody can be found with military intelligence.
Paragraph.
Examined, diagnosed and treated a total of five Kim Lucks a new Kim Luck record I hope will stand for a long time.
Paragraph.
Property of Corporal O'Reilly returned.
Father and teddy bear doing nicely.
Well, I guess that's about it, Radar.
Hey, you guys wanna see the pinstripe suit of all time?
Yeah.
He's a great tailor, but with a lousy sense of direction.
Hey!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Do you believe that breakfast?
Premature leftovers.
Another day in the R.O.K. Nurse, I'm putting myself in your hands.
- That'll be a switch.
- Don't get fresh, Doctor.
I can't help it.
I have myself flown in fresh every day.
All right, people, everything shipshape in here?
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Except the camp is taking on water.
Can the sarcastication, Captain and start taking a real interest in our effort.
Are you serious?
I just made a big bet on the war.
- Yeah?
Who do you like?
- I got the United Nations and eight points.
I think that's a pretty good bet if MacArthur's shoulder holds out.
I certainly hope we're not gonna have this kind of tomfoolery - during General Kelly's inspection.
- Who's General Kelly?
"Iron Guts" Kelly happens to be one of the greatest fighting generals in our nation's history.
I think I know him.
Always fights in purple trunks?
Glass jaw?
- Uh, Rad Jumpin' - Sir!
He's here, sir.
- Any word on Gen - General Kelly just pulled in the compound.
Holy moley.
Okay, stash the polish.
I'll put it under "P".
Camp cleaned up?
No crap games?
- No one's invited any business girls?
- Yes, sir.
None, sir.
- Good, good.
I need a drink.
- The smell, sir.
I'll take vodka.
It doesn't have any.
Radar, come here a minute.
- What do you smell?
- Bourbon.
Oh, rats.
I never should have had that before the vodka.
- Here, sir.
Have some gum.
- Oh, thanks, Radar.
Radar, I can't chew gum in front of a general.
Ten-hut!
- Colonel Blake.
- Uh, sir?
- I'm Colonel Wortman - Colonel.
Aide to Lieutenant General Kelly.
- General.
- Colonel.
- General.
- First-rate.
Uh-huh.
Uh, your treatment of the wounded.
The general's impressed with your high record of achievement in the mending of our men.
Thank you, General.
That's mighty nice.
- The men, that's what it's all about.
- That's what the general believes.
I believe in their care, their welfare.
Nothing's too good for the men.
A general marches on his men.
Yes, sir.
I'm sure, sir.
Is that one salute for the whole war, sonny?
Hmm?
Bet he lied about his age to get in.
He won't have to lie about his injuries to get out.
It kills me.
They're such babies.
When I was his age, I couldn't make up my mind whether to become a doctor or a fireman.
What'd you finally decide?
Well, I'm a doctor, but I have a pole in my office.
Give me some suction here, Mr. Kwang.
Psst.
Psst.
He's on his way, over here.
- Who's over here on his way?
- General Kelly.
Iron Guts.
Never fails.
The one day I don't go to the beauty parlor.
- Shall we get out the good silverware?
- This is the good silverware.
Uh-oh.
It's three stars at 12:00.
- Try to look busy for the general.
- Bleed at attention, please.
Yeah, that's good.
All right, go work on the next one.
- Yeah, okay.
- Doctors, we have a guest.
That's a relief.
I thought it was a stickup.
Uh, Captains Pierce, Mclntyre, this is Lieutenant General Kelly.
Excuse us for not saluting, General.
Our hands are all full of"icch".
What seems to be wrong with this soldier?
Well, he's got a weight problem.
Caught about five pounds of lead in his belly.
You boys are certainly doing a fine job.
- You too, General.
- Pierce.
We could never do any of this without your help, sir.
Not at all.
I shudder to think what the army would do without you fine doctors.
Probably bleed all over themselves.
And what medical unit would be complete without these lovely angels of mercy?
Please, general, don't contaminate our nurse.
If you'll step outside, sir, I'll have you sterilized.
They kid because of the tension.
- Yes, it helps create more.
- Uh, right.
Yes.
No.
Uh, Pierce Uh, sir, would you like to see X ray?
Something may develop there.
-  - Give me another one.
That's all right.
Likewise, I'm sure.
How about a little, uh, splash, General?
- Do you drink during a war?
- Are we under attack?
I always feel that way, sir.
Well, I'll have a double rye.
- Uh, with soda?
Water?
- You got something against rye, Colonel?
Uh, double rye for the general, Mr. Kwok.
Colonel?
I'll have the same as the general.
The colonel will have what the general is having and I'll have what the general and colonel are having.
- Rye, sir?
- Right.
Only make mine scotch.
Yes, sir.
A little quiet around here for a war.
- Well, thank you, sir.
- The general means What I mean is, if I don't hear some good old-fashioned gunfire every now and again I think I'd go out of my mind.
Would you like me to send a few of my men out to the rifle range, sir?
That's what you need around here some music.
- Thank you.
-  Oh, uh, General Kelly, I'd like you to meet our very fine head nurse, Major Houlihan and, uh, Major Burns, one of our best surgeons, a real killer.
- Major.
- General.
- General.
- Major.
- And the general's aide, Colonel Wortman.
- Major.
- Colonel.
- Colonel.
- Major.
- Colonel.
- General.
Hmm?
Oh, no.
My colonel, Colonel.
Oh, I'm sorry, General.
I got it all brass-backwards.
Uh, Colonel, maybe the majors will join us in a drink.
Just being in your presence is intoxicating enough, General.
A very kind thing to say.
We're always surprised that she can be kind, sir.
General, I wonder if I might take a snapshot for my scrapbook.
Sure, if you wanna take a chance on breaking your camera.
This all right with you, Major?
- Oh, General, I'd be flattered.
- You back far enough, Frank?
Excuse me.
- Oh!
Your gun is digging into my thigh.
- Lucky gun.
Would you take a picture of me and the general with the major, Colonel?
Oh, you got it.
Colonel Wortman, why don't you go along with Major Burns here and check out the unit's motor pool setup and see how closely it conforms to the Pentagon's new Franistan Plan.
Give it a good going-over.
Take your time, a couple ofhours at least.
- Yes, sir.
- Now, General?
General, what is the Franistan Plan?
A tremendous army research project for making crankcase oil edible after 5,000 miles.
Really?
- Major?
- Yes, Colonel.
General.
Oh, sorry.
How about a refill, General?
Hmm?
Oh, oh.
No, thanks, Colonel.
It's  getting to be about that time.
Got to put the little old stars to bed.
Oh, well, then, I'll just show you the V.I.P. Tent, sir.
Oh, that won't be necessary.
Oh, it's-it's no bother.
Whenever you're ready, General.
I'll see you in the morning, Colonel.
Oh, fine.
Then you probably won't be seeing any more of me right now.
I've got dirt to scratch and eggs to lay.
General.
Major.
- Pierce, wake up!
Pierce!
- Huh?
- I've got to see you.
- Margaret, this is a recurring dream come true.
- My tent.
- Whatever you say.
Gee, now I wish I'd shaved last month.
-  - What's up?
I need your help.
I'm in trouble.
Terrible trouble.
And you, a nurse?
Take two aspirin and give two to the rabbit.
- Please!
- Please?
Hey, Doc.
Come on over.
We're having a party with some of the local lovelies.
No, thanks.
I'm a happily unmarried man.
There's a lot of big brass around.
You guys got to keep it down or we'll have to pinch your girls.
- Devil.
- Yes, sir.
Probably a massive M.I. If his last words were "I shall return," don't wait.
I think his pulse stopped before he did.
This is terrible.
Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.
I'm sure it's a first for him too.
- Did you try to resuscitate him?
- How do you think he died?
We've got to get him out of here.
Well, the only problem is all the walk's gone out of his legs.
Psst.
!
Margaret, it's me.
It's Frank.
What do I do with him?
- Well, this is no time to go into that.
- Not in front of the general.
Margaret, let me in.
I've got to talk to you.
I've got a terrible headache.
Well, it's not a "headache" visit.
I just wanna talk.
Just a minute, Frank.
- What is it, Frank?
- Well, Margaret, l - What's going on?
- Nothing's going on, Frank.
I just couldn't sleep.
- And we couldn't sleep.
- So we're all here not sleeping together.
- Gin.
- Get rid of them.
- You cheated.
- I did not.
- Give me 20 minutes.
- It's so unlike you having them here.
Well, it's all right, Frank.
It's unlike them too, so I know you cheated 'cause I taught you everything you know.
- Come again, Frank.
- Good night, Frank.
Don't you wish.
Just as I suspected a closet general.
Step right this way, sir.
- Trap.
- Check outside.
All clear.
Where are you taking him?
To the V.I.P. Tent.
- Will that be all right?
- He doesn't seem to mind.
Hey, hey, hey.
All we need is for somebody to salute him.
He'd probably return it out of reflex.
Okay.
Come on.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
What's wrong?
Is the general ill?
- He's a little past ill.
- What are you saying?
- He's dead.
- Dead?
What He can't be dead.
Look, we both studied "dead".
This man's dead.
But he-he-he was fine a little while ago.
What happened?
- Myocardial infarction.
- What does that mean?
It means his pearl-handled guns are up for grabs now.
Well, this is horrible.
How did it happen?
- Um - We'd rather not say.
Let's just say he expired in here.
He just V.I.P.'ed away.
No.
He died in action, at the front.
That's what the headlines will read.
Leading his troops against overwhelming odds with shells bursting all around him until that one shell with his name on it caught up with him.
That's how General "Iron Guts" Kelly died.
Oh, I see.
Not, uh Oh.
I got a pretty good idea of how he really went but it's got to appear as though he died more meaningfully.
There is a Zen saying: "Just as a clay jar will sooner or later crumble while being lowered into a well so all generals must eventually perish in battle".
All you have to do is sign the death certificate.
I'll fill in the details.
There's another Zen saying: "Only doctors with holes in head sign death certificates like gift vouchers".
- Count us out.
- Then I'll have to order you.
- That's different.
- Then we refuse.
Is the captain aware of chain of command?
Is the colonel aware of the Hippocratic oath?
We have sworn never to misrepresent.
Never to use tongue depressors for shoehorns.
Never to have ourselves paged at the front.
And not to open the Acme Death Certificate Company.
History demands that the general die a glorious death.
You know where we can hire If you lie about the general dying in battle it's unfair to the thousands of guys who really did.
Not at all.
He was willing to die that way, hoping to die that way.
He was a nutcase.
I think dying this way may have saved his life.
Good night, Colonel.
I'll see you both at court-martial.
We'll be the ones with our hands on the Bible.
Uh, Captains.
Uh, I appeal to your patriotism, your sense of fair play.
- Make up your mind.
- Just one favor.
He's too heavy for me to lift.
Put the general in an ambulance, and I'll drive him to the front.
- That much we can do.
- But not a word of this to Hippocrates.
- You there!
-  - Get me the war on the phone.
- The war, sir?
The front, boy.
The front.
That's not a teddy bear?
Uh, yes, sir.
Regulations against having the real kind.
Let's get on the stick.
- Do you have the number of the front, sir?
- No, I don't.
Uh, is it an unlisted battle?
Just get me an army sector where there's heavy fighting.
I've got to get there.
Uh, Eighth Army, Uh, Ra Here you go, sir.
Colonel Wortman here, aide to General Kelly.
What's the picture up there?
Exchanging any heavy fire?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I see.
No fighting, but lots of diarrhea.
Why would you wanna go to the front to see that, sir?
- It's not for me.
It's for the general.
- Oh.
Get me, um Get me Hill 413.
I know we've been trying to take it for weeks.
Hill 413.
Uh, yeah, uh, MASH 4077 th.
How's it going up there?
Yeah?
Uh, oh, right.
Uh, I'm sorry, sir.
We took that hill.
- What rotten luck.
- Well, you can't lose 'em all.
Don't you know where there's some action going on?
Uh, well, there's always Rosie's place across the road.
Where's the morning paper?
They've always got a war going.
Oh, we don't get this morning's paper for two weeks, sir.
Well, call around.
This is a war.
- Someone must be fighting it somewhere.
- Yes, sir.
The general's heavier than I thought.
About a hundred pounds of it is ego.
- Your end first.
- Okay.
This reminds me of medical school.
- We once took a cadaver to a football game.
- You're kidding.
He was a lot more fun than my date.
-  - Who is it?
-  It's me.
- Me who?
Me.
Frank.
What is it, Frank?
What do you mean, "Me who"?
When I say "It's me"?
How many me's do you know?
Frank, you're the only "me" in my life.
Now, please go.
- What's the matter with you, Margaret?
- I have a headache.
A tremendous headache.
It goes all the way down to my waist.
Get it, Frank?
One of those headaches.
Something is going on around here, Margaret.
Oh, Frank, you're the only thing that's going on around here.
- I saw them.
- They're not here.
- Who's not here?
- They're not, and he's not either.
He who?
Nobody's here, Frank.
You and I are here.
And you're not even here, officially.
Margaret, I saw Pierce and Mclntyre fooling around with a body.
Well, you know what perverts they are.
A dead body.
Now, that's not their job.
Now, why are they suddenly acting like undertakers?
Well, how do I know, Frank?
Maybe they're moonlighting.
Frank, my headache is killing me.
What's the matter with everyone in this camp?
The general's aide has me giving him a pillowcase count and a history of urology.
Pierce and Mclntyre are acting like body snatchers.
- And every time I come in here, you Ow!
-  - Margaret, what is this?
- What is this?
What this?
Well, it's a star.
A general's star.
Oh.
Well Well, if it's a general's star, then then-then it's a general's star.
Frank, my headache is leaking out of my ears.
- What's a general star doing in here?
- Well, it's very simple, Frank.
General Kelly's daughter wants to be an army nurse and he wanted to see what her quarters would look like so he asked if he could come over and look at mine.
- Well, did he?
- Did he what?
- Look at yours?
- Get out!
Take your nasty little mind and your skinny little lips and get out, ferret face!
- Oh, great.
Uh, sir, I think I found you a war.
- Where?
You wanna give me your location again, please?
Three miles northeast of Inchon longitude 70, latitude 27.
- Are they drawing heavy fire?
- Sir, the enemy blew up two of our bridges but we recaptured the hill and there's heavy casualties on both sides.
Great.
Wonderful.
Well, I guess I'll let you get back to your fun.
Come on.
Your limousine is waiting.
Keep it down, girls.
- Hope this is dry enough for you.
- Can't be drier than I am.
Here's to "Iron Guts" Kelly.
He died with his boots on.
And his socks off.
- I found a sector that's being bombed.
- What a lucky sector.
Where's the ambulance?
Well, it just pulled out.
We thought you took it.
- I didn't take the ambulance.
- Well, I should hope not, Colonel.
- It was full of floozies.
- Uh-oh.
Just what ambulance are we talking about, Major?
Well, the one parked in front of the V.I.P. Tent.
- Oh, my - They won't get far, Colonel.
I called the M.P.s. That ambulance is going to be stopped and everyone inside arrested.
You can't do that.
That's restraint of trade.
Major if it's the last thing I do I'll see that you hang by your clusters.
What's the matter with him?
Why did he jump on me like that?
Are you blind, Frank?
The man's crazy about you.
Right, Trap?
- What?
- Oh, yeah, Frank.
You're playing it just right hard to get.
You vixen.
What are you doing there?
Nothing.
I swear it.
Get me the M.P. Checkpoint, on the double.
Yes, sir.
You want me to get you one under fire?
Radar, what in blazes is going on?
The whole camp is jumping.
- Uh, well -  MASH 4077 th.
Colonel Blake here.
When?
How?
- Wow.
- What is it?
A Korean national on a bicycle, his family, their furniture and a pig made a bad turn and sent one of our ambulances over an embankment.
Was anyone hurt?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, they pulled six business girls out of the ambulance.
They're okay, but the general's dead.
He's been killed.
General who?
- Kelly?
- Wow!
General General Kelly's been killed.
You think the girls would've broken his fall.
Well, I mean, Lord, he was just here.
What was he doing in an ambulance?
I didn't know he was sick.
Colonel Wortman here, General Kelly's aide.
Now, listen carefully.
This is an order.
Take the general's body, put it in a jeep and drive it up to "G" Sector.
Uh, sir, there's no fighting there, just diarrhea.
I'll provide the fighting.
Get on with it.
Get me Kimpo Air Base.
- Yes, sir.
- I want a squadron of jets.
And get me the navy for some offshore bombardment.
Major General Robert "Iron Guts" Kelly is gonna perish in a full-scale, blazing, all-out glorious, star-spangled-banner death.
- Hey, guys.
- Yes, Henry?
Is he talking about killing a general who's already dead?
- That's right, Henry.
- Well, uh, isn't that sort of crazy?
And rockets.
I want plenty of rockets.
That's for the red glare.
- Here it is, Trap.
Front page.
Stars and Stripes.
- Lay it on me.
"The Pentagon announced today the death of one of the U.S. Army's most colorful figures Lieutenant General Robert "Iron Guts" Kelly, a man who was loved by all".
Only one time too many.
Seems he died in battle.
"In action to the finish, heroic to the end".
I got a bad taste in my mouth.
I'm gonna go gargle with a martini.
There you go, hiding behind booze again, afraid to face reality.
Reality is up for grabs.
One man's reality is another man's fantasy.
Right.
You take the reality one I'll take the one with the big fantasy.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Attention, all surgical personnel report to operating room.
Incoming casualties arriving by chopper, ambulance and jeep.
It's gonna be a big one, folks.
How do I know you mean it?
I haven't been in love in two or three days.
Right after this shift, huh?
I know a tent with a gypsy violinist and a fortune-teller who reads army boots.
- I've got nothing to wear.
- Now I know I'm in love.
We got customers.
You didn't get home last night.
Where were you?
There's ten bucks for anyone who can tell me.
You certainly were feeling no pain at the club.
Why?
Just because he tried to eat the cherries out of a slot machine?
I didn't.
Embarrassing.
Not at all.
At closing time, you slipped a nurse over your shoulders - and left like a perfect gentleman.
- Terrific.
I just want you to You got this, Radar?
I don't wanna run out of anything.
Pierce, Mclntyre.
- I checked Supply, sir.
It's gonna be a big one.
- It's gonna be a big one.
- They're sending extra blankets.
- We need extra blankets.
- I've cleared the roads for the ambulances.
locals off the roads.
- We don't wanna block the ambulances.
- I'll get on this.
Let's get on this right away.
Looks like this kid was playing beanbag with a hand grenade.
- Gimme a ten blade.
- Number ten blade.
Got a repeater here.
These look like your stitches, Hawk.
If they look like stitches, he isn't mine.
Pierce, you need a modesty transplant.
- Clamp.
- Clamp.
-  - Got enough thumbs over there, Colonel?
Send a case of thumbs to that table with my compliments.
I don't happen to think that's funny, Captain.
How'd you like to step outside, lady?
- May I have your attention, please?
- Stop bleeding for a minute.
My personal tortoise-shell scrub brush given to me by my lovely mother with my initials in gold leaf, is missing out of the scrub room again!
Did you look in your last patient, Frank?
That's how most of your stuff leaves here.
Oh, very comical.
If I had a sleeve, I'd laugh up it.
- Colonel, Major Burns is being abused again.
- Cut that out, Frank.
- How many wounded we got out there, Frank?
- Thirty, forty.
More comin'.
Come on, Ginger.
Move it, honey.
Checkout time is 3:00.
Easy.
- What do we have here?
- Ethiopian soldier.
Boy, did he take a wrong turn.
Multiple fragment wounds.
Okay.
Margaret, you're fantastic.
Fits me like a glove.
Looks like a long session, sir.
Would you like to have the sound from the movie piped in?
That's good thinking.
Klinger, take that dress off at once!
Not in front ofTrapper.
He's a married man.
You're gonna be fine, fella.
That's easy for you to say.
Uh, here's some coffee, Hawkeye.
And your razor.
Uh, we used all the hot water on the instruments.
Radar, when this is all over the two things I'm gonna miss the most are you and dysentery.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Anything else you want me to get you while I'm on the get?
Bring me a Maine lobster, about a three-pounder some drawn butter, bedspring French fries and a liter of the house white wine.
Make sure you don't bring it from the lab.
Will that be all?
Yeah, that should about do it.
Send the bill to MacArthur.
He can deduct it as an entertainment expense.
Yeah, okay, well, I gotta get goin'.
Uh, some, uh, personnel is donating blood - and I promised the donors doughnuts.
- Run along, Andy.
How we doing, Chief?
So far, two thoracotomies, a bowel resection - a splenectomy - And a partridge in a pear tree.
I must have used a half a mile of silk in there.
Hey, I don't want to be a back-seat doctor but you know you dropped your hardware three times?
What, are you keeping score, hotshot?
- Doctor.
Doctor.
- Uh, the Ethiopian, sir.
He wants to say something to the doctor.
I think he's thanking you.
Well, that's Haile Selassie of you, sir.
Keep him warm.
That's got to be the nicest fee I ever got.
- How long have you had this?
- Had what?
I just get cramps, in there.
Don't you ever?
Oh, are you kidding?
I'm the cramp champ.
I'm the camp cramp champ.
- I can tell the onset of arthritis.
- Arthritis?
Yeah, you remember, from medical school?
"Arthritis".
Came after "acne".
Right before "arrangements for time payments".
It's just fatigue.
It comes and goes.
Henry, this could be your ticket home.
I'll sign the diagnosis, we'll stick it in your belly button, and you're off.
Pierce, I'll level with you.
I've got a great practice back home.
They all come to see me.
I'll bet there's no one in Bloomington, Illinois, that I haven't seen naked.
But, uh, it's routine.
- Cookbook medicine?
- Yeah.
Yep, but this place this place, which has all the attraction of a lanced boil has given me the opportunity to do more doctoring than I can do in a lifetime back in the world.
Wars don't last forever, Henry, only war does.
One day you're gonna have to go back home and die in your bed in Bloomington.
I've done that several times.
One extra brandy at the club, and I have to leave an I.O.U. On my wife's pillow.
I must say, senora, that's the best meal I've ever eaten.
It is the least I can give you for an afternoon of great emotion.
You followed your star yesterday.
You were inspired.
Hmm.
Who wouldn't be inspired?
- I'd seen you.
I wasn't bad, was I?
- What is that?
Blood and Sand.
Tyrone Power, Rita Hayworth.
The Frank and Hot Lips of old Seville.
Father, over here.
You got the I.V.?
- Yes, Trapper?
- He wants to write a letter before we put him under.
- Go ahead, son.
- Are you a priest?
- Very much so.
- That cross doesn't mean there's a railroad ahead.
It's to my wife, Mary Ellen.
Okay?
You're the only one I ever loved, honey.
That girl in Tokyo didn't mean a thing to me.
It was just one of those things.
Go ahead.
Same goes for that girl in Okinawa.
And those two in Honolulu.
When did you find time to get wounded?
Bye-bye.
Don't send it, Father.
He's gonna pull through.
- Unless his wife gets that letter.
- Right.
Can we turn that hogwash off?
Yes, sir.
- Uh, Colonel?
- Yo.
The cook says since everyone's gonna be in here tonight should he make cold food instead of hot?
- His hot food is usually cold enough for me.
- Hot food, cold food, movies.
- Retractor.
- Retractor.
So unprofessional in here.
I protest all these distractions!
Hear, hear!
Mostly I protest the wearing of falsies in the O.R. I wish you'd cut it out, Frank.
You're driving me crazy.
- Don't let him razz you, Frank.
- Oh, shut up.
- Frank!
- It's not an easy job, taking out a man's kidney.
Trap.
Put a pressure dressing on this, babe.
Do we got X rays on this?
Let's see the kidney, Frank.
This kidney's none of your business.
I don't come to your table and mess with your organs.
Frank, look at the X ray.
This guy's only got one.
One kidney?
I Well, he was so messed up.
We were in such a hurry.
Nobody told me they took X rays.
- I could've killed him.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Just happened to be in the neighborhood.
Whattaya mean, "No pulse"?
What I said, Doctor.
No pulse.
How did that happen?
He was doing so well.
- What's wrong?
- Get me a heart needle and some Adrenalin!
Come on.
Come on!
- No dice.
- Adrenalin, Doctor.
- Are you ventilating him okay?
- Yes, Doctor.
Still no pulse.
You're losing him.
The hell I am.
I'm not gonna let somebody screw up my batting average.
Give me a scalpel.
Stand by with a rib spreader.
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna try some open-heart massage.
- We've never done that!
- Neither has he.
Rib spreader!
- Rib spreader.
- Get them apart for me.
Pierce, you are one cool cucumber.
Here we go.
Clamp.
Sponge.
Clamp.
Sponge.
Come on, honey.
Move it.
I'm getting something.
Sixty over forty.
Come on.
You can do better than that.
I'm getting a pulse.
It's stronger.
- It's beating on its own.
- Ninety-two over sixty.
- Bingo!
- You did it!
That's my bunkie.
Taught him everything he knows.
I'll finish for you, Pierce.
Okay.
Thanks, Henry.
Thanks, everybody.
That was the most fantastic thing I ever saw.
Clamp.
- Henry, I gotta talk to you later.
- Anytime.
If I'm gonna do this kinda work, I gotta get more money.
- That's a little closer than I like it.
-  I hope we're givin' it to 'em good, those little yellow Reds.
Frank, you better take two yellow reds and go to sleep.
Oh, you like getting shot at, Dr. Goody Two-Shoes?
I just don't know why they're shooting at us.
All we want to do is bring them democracy and white bread transplant the American dream: Freedom, achievement, hyperacidity affluence, flatulence, technology, tension the inalienable right to an early coronary sitting at your desk while plotting to stab your boss in the back.
That's entertainment.
Pierce, you are certifiably insane.
Gee, I can't understand why.
Here I am, 20,000 miles from home, working as an extra in a war movie with this guy's blood dripping into my boot.
Nurse, you wanna do something about that, or must I kiss you into submission?
- Right away, Doctor.
- That's not insane-making, Frank.
Neither is bedding down every night with a flea circus or eating food prepared by a cook who used to make box lunches for kamikaze pilots.
Or getting so bored out of my skull I put on my dress uniform for a trip to the latrine.
Will you watch your language?
There are nurses present.
Oh, forgive me.
I'd like to offer the nurses a blanket apology.
Or even better, I'd like to offer them a blanket invitation.
- Smut merchant.
- Oh, pipe down, Burns.
Oh, sure!
Always!
You jump all over me, but he can say what he wants, and he gets away with it!
- Colonel's pet, that's what you are!
- I'll get you at recess!
Colonel, did you see that?
Do you mind, Major?
I'm trying to sew my glove into this patient.
Close for me.
I'm going to take five.
-  Make it ten.
- Years.
And take Mclntyre with you.
Klinger!
- Sir?
- Let him sleep outside.
We can use the table.
Which one of you's gonna tell him he's not the champ anymore?
You're a pistol.
We need some more sponges here, Margaret.
- We're running low!
-  My mother's name was Margaret.
That's funny.
It was my father's.
Orange juice, anyone?
Freshly "squozen".
- Thanks, Radar.
- Klinger, get over to the mess tent.
All the guys are givin' blood.
Blood!
I must give blood, or die!
Mclntyre I want to thank you for helping out on that kidney.
Anyone for orange juice?
Over here, boy.
TheJournal up yet?
Huh?
Just pour that in any part of me.
- Uh, juice, sir?
-  Just a minute, Radar.
- Wow.
- See what happens when you play with guns?
You okay?
You look beat, sir.
I feel like death on a soda cracker.
How are we doing?
Well, we're running out of gowns, towels and 3-0 silk.
Only thing we got plenty of is wounded.
Scrounge, Radar, scrounge.
and what I don't understand is why do people take an instant dislike to me?
It saves time, Frank.
Well, we got along fine, for the first two weeks.
Exactly, Frank, and that time was absolutely wasted.
But, deep down, there's no real hatred, is there?
Deep down?
No.
It's just that you're a joyless person, Frank.
You're D-U-L.
I'm from a very strict family.
We weren't allowed to talk at meals.
We couldn't even hum.
Anybody who hummed got a punch in the throat.
- That's terrible.
- I think that's why I became a snitch.
So I could talk to somebody.
You were a snitch, Frank?
I'd squeal on anybody.
Once, in school, I caught my best friend smoking.
I didn't report him.
Later I snitched on myself for not snitching.
Gimme a break, Frank.
I'm very tired.
I'm hearing you through the wrong end of the binoculars.
All I'm asking is for you and Pierce to let up razzing me.
- Okay, Frank.
- Friends?
Friends, Frank.
No more hostility.
No more hatred.
Friends.
Now, shut up, Frank, or I'll kill ya.
Attention, all personnel.
Over 3,000 tons of scrap paper fell on General MacArthur in his homecoming parade in New York City.
I hope some of it was in bundles.
Just like you to malign one of the top ten generals in American history.
Margaret, the man was starting up with Red China.
You've got a point there, Hawk.
I suppose you could run the war better than a five-star general?
The Daily News only gave him four.
What do we got here that we could do without?
Business girl.
She got caught in some cross fire.
Nurse told me she found $20,000 on her.
I think I'm in the wrong business.
- Clamp.
- Hi, Henry.
- Hello, Sidney.
- When are you guys going to be through?
- Hold it.
- Yes, sir?
Rad We need more silk, Radar.
- We're all out, sir.
- All right.
In my tent, under my bed, next to the milk bottle there's a package of sewing thread.
- Lorraine sent it to me.
Go.
- Yes, sir.
Colonel, ordinary thread for stitches?
It's either that or use the stapler in my office, Major.
I gather our poker game is off.
Major Freedman.
The psychiatrist.
Remember me, sir?
Corporal Klinger?
Remember you?
I had to buy an extra cabinet for your file.
How 'bout it, sir?
Any chance for a psycho?
Klinger, there's 17 other guys wearing dresses ahead of you.
And some smart stuff.
No, wait.
Something new.
I'm beginning to wet the bed.
Anything?
- Get yourself a pair of rubber bloomers.
- Corporal?
- Clean towels.
- Yes, ma'am.
Well, I'll see you guys next week, then.
- Ho, Sidney.
Where you running?
- Scrub up.
You kidding?
I haven't washed my hands since I became a psychiatrist.
Only his mind gets dirty.
Margaret, scrub Dr. Freedman for surgery.
Medical school was a long time ago.
Last surgery I did was a boil on my kid's toches.
This way, sir.
Psychiatrist!
Hmph!
I have a few ideas on that subject.
Keep talking, Frank.
I could use the sleep.
Sex!
Sex!
Sex!
#The boys are marching ## That's all they think about.
I happen to believe there's more than just sex between a man and a woman.
Right.
There's smoking in the dark afterwards.
- Here's the thread, sir.
- Good.
- Goman, get it sterilized.
- Yes, Doctor.
Radar, check on the generator.
We need more juice in here.
You all right?
You look pale.
- I gave blood twice today, sir.
- You're not supposed to do that.
I fell asleep in the mess tent, and two guys siphoned me.
Simmons, close here.
I gotta take a shower.
- Father, what is it?
- Oh, these things happen.
He fell off his high heels.
- Thanks, Father.
- I'll look after the towels.
Fourteen ninety-five.
- All come back to you, Sidney?
- I just hope it doesn't all come up on me.
Get that, will you, Ginger?
Sorry, Doctor.
Welcome to the club.
It stains right, through.
I never wear underwear.
That's more than I need to know.
That's better.
You may think I'm kidding, Sidney but if you ever want to stop being a doctor, you could become a doctor.
This one's ready for post-op.
- Hawkeye?
- Not now, Radar.
I'm teaching this new man here malpractice.
Sir, I just had a talk with a nurse.
I hope you straightened her out.
You remember that open-heart massage patient before?
Yeah?
She told me to tell you that, uh, he didn't make it.
A few minutes ago.
Sorry, sir.
Damn.
Damn.
Damn it.
I've got some bleeding here.
Should I clamp it?
I thought I got to him in time.
-  Clamp it.
- Thanks.
Hawk he was gone once.
You bought him four hours he never would have had.
I've read all the procedures.
It's worked.
Maybe I should have stayed with him in post-op.
We needed you here.
You want to get back in the game?
I'm not ready to solo yet.
Tsk.
I really thought I'd pulled it off.
Some patients insist on dying, Hawk.
You knew that going in, but you had to be a doctor.
I never had any choice.
It's all I ever cared about.
It's all I ever wanted to do.
Sometimes I think I'd be more useful as a cocktail waitress.
You haven't got the legs for it.
Let me finish this myself, will you, Sidney?
Good idea.
Occupational therapy.
Ladies and gentlemen, take my advice: Pull down your pants and slide on the ice.
See you Thursday.
- Pierce, I need you.
- Two seconds.
One would be better.
Irrigate that area for me.
I'll be right back.
- What is it, Henry?
- Look at this.
- Oh, God.
- It's at least eight hours' work.
His liver's gone.
There's a dozen kids outside that can be saved.
He'll take two surgeons and who knows how many units of blood.
And what's worse, he'll never make it!
And meanwhile, we may lose some of the others.
Pierce, I have a lot of trouble with this kind of decision.
Henry, he never should have been brought in here in the first place.
Orderly, help me with this man, please!
- I smell something burning.
- We got hamburgers!
- And coffee!
-  Over here, miss.
- Ma'am.
-  Pardon me, Father.
-  Father?
- You want coffee?
I don't care what anyone says.
Something's burning.
Fire!
-  - Get the oxygen out of here!
- Ingmar, get this guy over here!
-  - The wiring's overloaded!
-   Cover 'em up!
Get outta here!
Let us out!
Gimme another one of these!
Get that one out first!
Hold it!
Hold it.
I got it.
Great thinking, Trap.
- You could have blown us up!
- How did you know that wasn't alcohol?
Hey, look, I'm sorry!
Maybe you'd like the fire back!
- I was merely pointing out - You could have blown us up!
Wait a minute.
Come on, folks.
The war, remember?
Of course.
It was in all the papers for a while.
-  Who wanted mustard?
- Get this man back here.
Okay, everybody.
-  -  Get over here.
Attention, attention.
All personnel may stand down.
Armed Forces Radio reports that General Mark W. Clark has just been appointed commander of the U.N. Forces in Korea.
General Clark succeeds General Ridgway who succeeded General MacArthur.
And that's the news, generally speaking.
No one's succeeding us at all.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
-  Frank, not bad.
-  We need some suction here.
-  Suction.
- Clean that out.
I can't see it well.
And a small favor, Margaret?
Could you run your body over my neck, please?
- Hemostat, Doctor.
- And some disability pay from the army.
Or a pair of corrective shoulders for terminal stoop.
Oh, cut the cackle, huh?
It's getting on my nerves.
As soon as I'm finished, Frank, I'll remove them for you.
One would think you would have a little consideration.
I've been up for - I've sent for some coffee, sir.
- Oh, you're a doll person.
After the war, I'm having a bust made of your head.
Or possibly the other way around.
Chest wound, Doctor.
Marine.
Just came in.
Take over here, will you, Phil?
- Is this guy continued on the next table?
- Check the I.V. Carotid artery.
Gimme some pressure here.
Vascular clamps.
All right, let's prep him.
Look at the size of that chest.
- You oughta see his mother.
- Am I gonna make it, Doc?
I don't know how to tell you this, but you're gonna live.
Even though you might break our blood bank.
You can level with me, Doc.
I know it's curtain time.
Only until we meet again.
All right, now take a deep breath and we'll get you stationery so you won't have to write home on your chest anymore.
Good night.
Hey.
Hey.
Do you believe someone has actually ordered us a genuine spring day.
What a dirty, rotten trick to put it in the middle of a war.
I'm gonna put that sky on hold.
That's just a mural painted by the North Koreans to catch us off our guard.
Listen.
You and me, we're gonna grab a couple of nurses some of that torpedo juice and ptt head for the hills.
Sorry.
I'm heading for the nearest cot, alone.
Right after I get some new feet from supply.
Are you serious?
After six months of freezing your noony you're actually gonna let a day like this go to waste?
-  - Here's the coffee you sirs wanted, sirs.
You're a little late, Radar.
We ordered it last winter.
Give him time.
He takes baby steps.
Save mine.
And take my beautiful day.
I'm having it later.
Uh, excuse me.
Isn't this, uh, Lieutenant Simmons's tent?
- That's me.
- Oh.
I didn't recognize you without your parka and hood.
I've never seen you in your underneath before.
I mean, it must be the cotton balls.
Oh, well, I've usually got these on.
- Oh, yeah.
- Can't see a thing without 'em.
Oh, really?
Oh, me too, neither.
Radar.
Tanning your tonsils, Radar?
- Sir?
- I'm going out and hit a couple of balls.
I just wanted to tell you that your anniversary issue of Archie Comics arrived.
And I evened your cot legs so you won't have to sleep on a slant anymore.
Oh, thank you, sir.
- Well, I guess that'll be all.
- Thank you.
Flare your nostrils for me, Frank.
I get so excited when you flare them.
Oh, Margaret, I get so excited when you say "excited".
-  - Funny thing war.
Never have so many suffered so much so so few could be so happy.
Oh, Frank, we're so lucky to be two of the few and not the many.
I know, darling, and I love being both of us.
Margaret let me press my ears against your lips.
Frank, we're not alone.
Huh?
"Breathless, we flung us on the windy hill".
- Hey, Klinger!
- Shh!
"Laughed in the sun, kissed in the lovely grass.
You said, 'Through glory and ecstasy we pass".
' - Poetry, right?
- Mm-hmm.
That's great the way they can rhyme and be hot at the same time.
Rupert Brooke.
I won him in a poker game.
Is that for me?
Oh, yeah.
Came special delivery.
I thought it might be important.
I think it's from, uh Radar, do you know what this says?
I couldn't help it, honest.
I held it up to the sun to shade my eyes and some of the words showed through.
"They have known shame, who loved unloved.
"Even then when two mouths thirsty for each other find slaking".
"Slaking"?
Wow!
I've appealed to him several times, Doctor.
He's not hurting the cat.
He just won't release it.
- Sorry I had to wake you.
- That's all right, Father.
The nurse I was dreaming was a rerun anyway.
Well, the cat's someone to love obviously.
He's over there.
- Where'd he get it?
- Must havejust wandered into camp.
He refuses to let go, Doctor.
My mother had the same problem with me at the induction center.
Anything you want to talk about, soldier?
I think the cat's got his tongue.
Hey, nobody wants to take him away from you.
You can hold him as long as you want.
You better bring in a psychiatrist.
This is out of my league.
- What's his name?
- Fluffy.
- I mean the patient, Father.
- We don't know, Doctor.
They brought him in without dog tags.
Don't get too attached to this place.
It really stinks.
Even though a lot of people are sucked in by the lobby.
- Is that you, Doc?
- I certainly hope so.
Well, Doc, you saved my life.
No one's ever done that before.
My guess is nobody's ever had to.
- Lyle Wesson.
- Hawkeye Pierce.
And I'm gonna need that back by tonight.
Hawkeye Pierce.
You're some kind of genius doctor.
And I'm gonna pay you back, Doc.
Anything.
You just name it.
If I draw you a picture, can you have her under my pillow by morning?
I'm not kidding, Doc.
I'm gonna pay you back.
You'll see.
Okay, fine.
Okay, you just lie back and hope the bed can take it.
Colonel Blake.
!
Colonel!
Colonel.
Special delivery.
My girl Laverne, she said yes.
She agreed to marry me!
Klinger, has she ever seen you?
We've been dating since high school.
Of course she's seen me.
I mean, recently.
Sir, you gotta let me go, sir.
I just have to get married.
- You're not pregnant, are you?
- Don't be ridiculous, sir.
Me?
You're the one who looks like he just blew out of Gone With the Wind.
Sir, I only want a small, quick little wedding in Toledo.
Then a teeny, tiny, one-two-three honeymoon, then I'll be right back.
Everyone who believes that, stand on their head.
You saying I'm lying, sir?
I'm saying you're so desperate to get out of Korea, you'd have yourself buried with a soda straw through the coffin so you could breathe.
Forget it.
Hey, Lulu, they got the volleyball schedule up.
Oh, great.
Who am I with?
- Terrific.
We got Murphy on our team.
- Right.
Isn't that great?
And Rogers.
Oh, Ghiardelli.
That's okay, hmm?
## Oh, Lieutenant Baker, I'm glad I bumped into you.
I was noticing on your file that you never answered Question 7 on your health card and we need to know.
So, uh, have you ever had cholera diphtheria, bubonic plague, jungle rot, or not?
- Not.
- Not.
Okey-dokey.
Well, I'll get that off to Washington right away.
- That's my marine, right?
- How'd you guess?
We just had a total eclipse of the sun.
Hey, Doc, how you doing today?
Everybody treating you okay?
Oh, the laundry put too much starch in my cummerbund.
But outside of that.
I'll tell you something.
You're a good ol' guy, you know that?
Oh, allow me.
- After you.
- Before me.
- Full house.
- That's what happens when Michelin gives you four stars.
Excuse me.
- Boys about done?
- Nope.
You know my mom always told me to leave the table a little hungry.
That way you don't feel so stuffed, right?
Yeah, right.
Two just opened up here, Doc.
Uh, we gotta get our food, Lyle.
Don't say that.
He'll skewer the cook.
Fellas, you just sit on down and relax and I'll handle everything.
- Two with everything.
- I'm busy, fella.
No, no, no, no.
I said two with everything now.
Everything is just what you're gonna get.
How do you feel about long engagements?
"Dear Dad, I'm bringing home a marine.
He'll be the son you never had".
- I think you'll enjoy this.
- I won't let you down.
Uh, I was wondering if I could ask you two sirs about some advice.
Well, what are parents for?
Come on in.
Make yourself homely.
- Sit down.
- Oh.
Thanks.
- Little irrigation?
- Come again?
- Drink, Radar.
- Oh, no, no.
What's your problem?
And keep in mind, we can't work miracles with height.
Uh, well it's about this, um, woman.
A woman of the opposite sex, Radar?
Yeah, uh, Lieutenant Simmons.
You know her?
Nurse.
Simmons?
Uh, short, freckles, fat glasses?
I can't understand how you lost your job at the State Department.
Yeah, that's her usually, but you should see her without her parka.
- Can you arrange that?
- I mean I didn't.
But, uh, she was wearing this little, uh uh A pair of hands?
She was wearing two hands?
Uh, no, it was a  What's the diff?
For all she knows I'm dead.
What don't you prove to her you're alive?
Breathe in her face.
I can't because I'm ignoring her all the time.
-  Why?
- Because she's ignoring me.
Ah, but you ignored her first.
Yeah, that's because I'm trying to beat her to the ignore.
Radar, you're gonna cool yourself right out of business.
Why don't you let her know how you feel?
Take her to the pictures.
- Wow.
That's a great idea.
- Thanks.
We invented it.
Yeah, we get a two cents royalty every time a guy asks a girl to a movie.
Thanks.
I'll ask her to the, uh l I'll ask her to the movies.
All righty, BS2XYZ, I gotcha.
That's 6:00 p.m. There, Righty-o.
Roger Wilco.
Over and out.
Ten-four and goom-bye.
Okay, Klinger, you're all set.
Colonel, I could kiss you.
!
You do, and I'll chin myself on your nose.
You sure this radio thing's gonna work, sir?
Klinger, BS2 is a ham operator in Des Moines, Iowa, right?
Now he's gonna pick us up on his shortwave and call Laverne, your Laverne, at the chapel, collect in Toledo, so he can patch her phone into his radio which we can hear on our radio, in which Laverne can hear on her phone and her parents can hear on their extension.
- Simple?
- It would have been simpler to let me go home for this.
If I let you go home, Klinger, the next time I'd see you you'd be a Rockette at Radio City Music Hall.
Go get shaved and get into your gown.
Yes, sir!
Oh, excuse me, Lieutenant.
Uh, I'm measuring the camp.
Uh, you see, last year we had 2,986 square feet and this year we have 2,863.
And I have to figure out where we shrunk.
Uh, while we're on the subject, uh did you know that tonight's movie is First Born of Godzilla?
- The what?
- The First Born of Godzilla.
I saw the original before Godzilla ever got married.
Oh, well, I don't go in for movies much.
I'd rather just stay in and listen to some music or read some poetry.
Oh, uh, do you read poetry?
- Why?
Do you?
- Oh, yeah.
I'm always browsing up on a new poem.
- Who's your favorite?
- Uh, well, right now I'm interested in a new guy, uh, Ruptured Brook.
Boy, you guys bucking for a Section Eight really get my quills up.
You keep doing that just because you think we'll think it's strange.
Well, I'm here to tell you, you're not one bit stranger than I am.
Now, I'm going to count to five, and I want you to hand over that unauthorized cat.
One, two three, four.
Showing off for the patients again, Frank?
Patient?
Hmph.
He's not sick.
Just another one of those crybabies who's afraid to go back to the front.
Frank, can I borrow your doctor's diploma?
They're a little short in the latrine.
Har-dee-har.
Look, we know you love the cat.
Nobody wants to hurt it.
You can come visit it anytime you want.
We'll take good care of it.
I promise.
Okay?
Wanna give him to me?
Come on.
You can trust me.
Lovely.
Thank you.
Okay, everybody, just keep calm and nobody will get hurt.
Especially me.
Now, let's be careful.
Don't break the doctor, okay?
The cat and I have just talked it over, and he'd like to come back.
Hey, what the heck is going on here?
Oh, just another fan gone wild.
Well, don't worry, Doc.
I'll get you out of here quicker than you can shake a stick.
No, Lyle, Lyle, don't hurt him.
Be gentle.
My life is in his armpit.
Easy, buddy.
Take it easy.
Mr. Kwang, could we have some sedation here, please?
You all right, Doc?
Thanks, Lyle.
I guess that about makes us even in the lifesaving department.
- In fact, I owe you change.
- Oh, that was nothing.
I haven't even begun to pay you back yet.
What are you gonna do for an encore, make me immortal?
Well, I like you, Doc.
I like doing things for you.
You're the greatest.
Lyle, underneath these exceptional good looks - lurks a really rotten person, really.
- Oh, come on.
I'm the kind of guy who gets a kick out of tying knots in varicose veins.
I once did a postmortem an hour before the patient was ready.
-  Who is it?
- Uh, Corporal O'Reilly.
I can go away if I'm bothering you.
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Well, uh, we just got a new shipment in and I was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop by.
- Here's some candy.
- Oh, thank you.
I love chocolate even though it makes my face break out.
Mine too.
I mean, uh it did before I turned into a man.
Well, what's that?
Poetry?
Uh, uh-huh.
Well, sit down.
Read me a poem.
Well, I don't know if I should in mixed company.
I mean, they got stuff in here about, um you know, slaking and stuff like that.
Well, I'd love to hear some.
Okay.
I warned you.
Uh, let's see.
Oh, here's one.
"The damned ship" Oh, excuse me.
"lurched and slithered.
"Quiet and quick.
My cold gorge rose; "The long sea rolled, : I knew I must think hard of something "or be sick.
"Do I forget you?
"Retchings twist and tie me.
Old meat, good meals, brown gobbets, up I throw".
You don't give a girl a chance, do you?
- What?
- Oh, don't play coy with me, you heartbreaker.
Always standing off, playing hard to get while all the time you were looking right through me.
I didn't see anything.
Honest.
There ought to be a law against guys like you.
Uh, Lieutenant?
You're bending the book.
Can you still hear me, Miss Esposito?
Sure can, Father.
Loud and clear.
Oh, where were we?
- She just said the part about being sick and poor.
- Oh, yes.
Then, do you, Laverne Esposito take this, uh, man Corporal Max Klinger, to be your lawful wedded husband?
I d - What happened?
- Oh, fishhooks.
Interference.
Well, find it.
Find it, damn it!
Oh, sorry, Father.
It's a wedding, son.
I understand your anger.
- Well?
- Just keep your garters on, Klinger.
And then you add a pound of shelled pecans and a bottle of lemon extract.
Um, KN5YVJ calling BS2XYZ in Des Moines.
Come in.
Over.
-  - ## - With our compliments.
- Hey, thanks.
That's really nice of you sirs to get dressed up.
It's from the States.
My grandfather was buried in this.
Oh.
I'm really touched.
I always thought so.
Look, lady, I'm a doctor trying to marry a soldier in the middle of a war.
That's sick!
-  Hello?
- A little more veil, please.
I can still see your face.
You want my recipe for never-fail corn bread?
Lady, you are a piece of corn bread.
Scott!
Zelda!
Just in time.
- Out of our way.
- May I see your invitations, please?
- Friends of the bride or the bride.
- You're out of uniform!
I am not.
I'm with Fred Waring.
Disgusting!
You have your nerve, wearing white.
Jealous?
Doc, I've been looking all over for you.
Boy, you guys sure throw some weird parties, huh?
It's our prom night.
These kids have been saving up all year for this.
Well, look it, Doc.
I'm shoving off tomorrow and I thought maybe I could have your home address.
Maybe we could be pen pals after the war.
Lyle, it it would just be boring for you.
I write everything in prescriptions.
Come in, Laverne, wherever you are.
I demand this wedding be stopped immediately.
- Oh, shut up, Major.
- Did you hear that?
I certainly did.
Are you gonna let him talk to you that way?
You're angry when you're beautiful.
Listen, big nose!
What'd you call him?
Button up, Frank, and zip up too.
Well, who are you ordering about, Mr. Sassing-A-Major-Pants?
I thought the doc told you to be quiet.
That's all right, Lyle.
He never obeys my commands.
What a report this is going to make.
That pervert marrying no one, a cat living in the hospital and this idiot insubordinating his big mouth whenever he pleases.
Uh, Frank, uh, I wouldn't, uh - Oh, shut up!
- That's it!
- Uh-oh.
- Frank!
Let me go, you big moron!
Put him down!
You can't twirl an officer!
-  - Oh, this is outrageous!
I think he's had enough, Lyle.
We don't want his brain to rush to his head.
Apologize.
No report.
I do!
I do!
No report!
Please!
Honest!
Lyle, you really got to stop doing things like that.
- It puts people off.
- Yeah, you're right, Doc.
I'm always doing the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
Well, that's okay.
You're a big person.
You deserve bigger mistakes.
No.
Lyle bad person.
Does bad things.
No, you're not.
Lyle good.
Hawkeye bad.
Hey, hey, I think I've got her.
Is that you, pumpkin?
- Yes, I'm here, baby.
- No, this Miss Esposito, ready?
Would you repeat, "I do".
- I do.
- And do you, Max Klinger - I do!
I do!
- You'd better hurry.
She's fading.
Bless, O Lord, this ring in Toledo that he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in thy peace.
- I now pronounce you man and wife.
Amen.
- ##   Radar, what happened to you?
I don't know.
I think I've been slaked.
Here's to the biggest cannon in the war.
And it's a comfort to know it's in Your hands.
We're safer with the rain, you know?
One more lovely spring day like yesterday and we'll need a group lobotomy.
You guys got any books on poetry?
Radar, come in here.
Your voice is getting deeper.
Your skin is clearing up.
Well, I got this friend.
- Who is she?
- Who says it's a she?
- Then who's he?
- It's not a he.
Radar, there are only "he's" and "she's".
Look, he's blushing.
I am not.
My cheeks are just red.
Aw, Radar, come on.
Tell your Uncle Trapper.
And your Aunt Hawkeye.
Why can't you sirs just act like sirs, sirs?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Testing.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Testing.
"A," "B," "C," "D," "E," "F," "G," "H" # I got a gal in Kalamazoo # Give me that.
All right.
Attention.
Attention, please.
May I have the attention of each and every personnel, please?
This is your commanding officer, Colonel Blake.
I thought it was Major Bowes.
It's required that everyone be given a routine medical checkup.
This is according to a new army regulation which is, uh, your RP78/80778J Uh, blah, blah, blah.
Accordingly, enlisted men will fall into the mess tent to receive their physicals.
Officers will examine themselves and vice versa in private.
Is there anything else that I should tell them, Radar?
Okay.
Tonight's movie is a double feature Godzilla and the Bobby-Soxer plus Ma and Pa Kettle Have a Baby.
#Zoo, zoo, zoo-zee-zoo # Ah, ah, ah Don't swallow the doctor.
You're a typical soldier, soldier.
Fine for the army, but not fit to be drafted.
Trapper, take a look at this.
Rotatory scoliosis.
Hmm.
Haven't seen many of those.
Nothing to worry about.
You were born that way.
Your vertebrae are trying to pass each other on a hill.
What's a pretty girl like you doing in a war like this?
Klinger, are you Catholic?
Your heart's playing "The Bells of St. Mary's".
- Two degrees of temperature?
- He's not a well woman.
- I'm not the complaining type.
- Since when?
Step over there, sir and/or madam.
- Hi, Frank.
- Hello, Frank.
- That's your business.
Customers waiting.
Why do I always get stuck with "turn your head and cough"?
- You have the gift, Frank.
- You have a perfect head for hernias.
You daffy-doodles always have an answer.
- Send them in.
- Step behind the screen and drop your pants.
Step behind the screen and raise your skirt.
All right, girls.
Attention, please.
Now, I will give you the preliminary exam and then the doctors will go to work on you.
Bear in mind that you are the cream of American military womanhood serving your Uncle Sam and entitled to dignity.
No smart remarks no insinuations, sex or smut-wise.
You are women, desirable women.
Most of you.
But army regulations forbid any doctor to assist you from undressing into disrobement.
Further, they can do nothing, nothing, when you are alone with them but give you a good going-over.
Now, when I call your name, please scream.
##  - New girl in town?
- I'm giving Hot Lips her physical.
- Does Frank know?
- I was thinking of tying him in a chair and making him watch.
He's scheduled to do my physical.
Fat chance.
I'll do you.
I'm used to autopsies.
Nobody's examining me.
This place is medically medieval.
The lab equipment went up San Juan Hill with Teddy Roosevelt.
Most of you guys wouldn't know a disease unless it was social and there's not a clean finger in the whole camp.
What did you get, a package of hostility from home today?
That's how I feel: To hell with it.
You certainly woke up from your nap cranky.
Have a gargle?
Our kidneys, sir.
They were fun while they were alive.
And so were we.
- It's got to be the worst.
- Can't be.
It's real gin.
Oh, terrible.
Does this mean my taste buds have been raped?
Am I condemned to drinking Vitalis on the rocks for the rest of my life?
Wicked.
- Let's make a pact about drinking.
- All right.
Let's never stop.
I'm off to Hot Lips country.
If I'm not back in two days, alert intensive care.
Hi.
Doctor's here, darling.
Oh, yes, the physical.
Physical to you, the house call of a lifetime to me.
You blond palomino hussy.
Where do you wanna start?
-  -  - Ah.
Ah.
- Ah.
- Ah.
- Ah.
Attaboy.
- Never had your tonsils out, huh?
- Should I, sir?
Just a thought.
They're big enough to be a baby's backside.
- Glands okay.
- Thank you, sir.
All right.
Stand with your little feet together.
Close your eyes.
Extend your arm and touch the old nose.
Your nose, Radar.
Your nose.
A few deep breaths, Margaret.
Breathe hard.
Pretend I'm Frank.
I know how to breathe hard, Doctor.
If I locate your heart, do I get a finder's fee?
You're very fit, Major.
I guess that's 'cause you throw so many.
Could stand to lose about ten pounds, though.
- What?
- Stop grazing between meals.
Right in through there.
That should be posted as a slide area.
- You're also getting a little flanky.
- You're crazy.
Walking away from people, you look like you're wearing two strange bulldogs in a bag.
Are you quite finished, Doctor?
Roll up your sleeve from the neck down.
We'll do it my way.
Pressure pooper.
Strip to the waist.
Bare naked, sir?
Radar, I'm not casting for the Ziegfeld Follies.
Yes, sir.
Radar, there is a you under there, isn't there?
I'm getting to me, sir.
Somebody naked scare you once?
My folks never took their clothes off, sir.
They said that the skin was the devil's slipcover.
For Pete's sake.
- What's that?
- That's my new tattoo.
It's an anchor.
Well, I mean, you're not in the navy.
I tried to get a red cross, but it was a buck fifty.
This was only 50 cents.
Radar, getting one of those is very unsanitary.
Oh, I washed my hands first, sir.
Right.
Let's audition your pump.
- Can you make it go up and down?
- No, not yet.
But I hum when I do it.
All right, Mclntyre.
Time for your checkup.
- Into your birthday suit.
- Take a walk, Frank.
- This is the army.
- Then take a hike.
Are you refusing to take your physical from a superior officer?
No, I'm refusing to take my physical from an inferior doctor.
- What's all the adrenaline for?
- Mclntyre's refused to take his clothes off for me.
Well, not everybody is Major Houlihan, Frank.
Which is a relief to us all.
Out, Frank.
Excuse me, sirs.
Remember that rotarian "sillyosis" thing that guy had on his back before?
- Yeah, yeah.
- I got it.
Just had an X ray taken, sir.
Get out!
- I just came in.
- There is no room in this tent for perverts.
Shall we all leave alphabetically?
The ink is still wet where you touched it up.
I swear I got it.
I can't wear anything backless.
- Out, Klinger!
Out!
- "Out, Klinger.
Out".
All right, Mclntyre.
Do I check you up, or check you into the stockade?
Hold it, mouth.
Look, Trap.
I'd rather be strung up by my Achilles tendon than agree with Major Disaster here.
Oh, fudge.
Refusing a checkup?
It doesn't make sense.
It's basic.
There something you wanna get off your chest, or arms, or legs?
Okay.
Okay.
I got a problem in my belly but I don't want it diagnosed here because I don't want to be treated in this pigpen.
Pain?
Yeah, when I'm empty.
Feels better when I eat.
- Wake you up at night?
- Yeah.
First I thought it was alcoholic gastritis.
You know, we've been hitting the sauce pretty good lately.
But the symptomology is wrong.
I've got heartburn that would light up the city ofToledo.
I've been taking this stuff here lately.
- Antacid.
Does that help?
- A little, but not enough.
I think I got a duodenal ulcer.
What's the smile for?
Trap, it's not just an ulcer.
If you've got one, that's your ticket home.
You've got a million-dollar hole in your belly.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey-hey!
You see that crater?
That's the money, Mclntyre.
Congratulations.
You've just given birth to a bouncing 1.2- Centimeter ulcer.
You are going back to the world, my friend.
Before you know it, you'll be home sleeping on the couch because you started talking in your sleep.
You know, I feel so terrible, I feel great.
You big, strong, dumb, silent types can't handle the tension.
All cool on the outside, but inside there's an acid factory in your belly.
Hey, we gotta have a snort on this.
- A little something to irrigate the "inwards".
- Hear, hear.
- Scotch or bourbon?
- Right.
- No, by me Good boy.
Radar.
Radar, bring us some milk, will you?
Who died?
Yes, sir.
You better call home and let your wife know you're coming.
Right, you don't wanna walk in on anything.
Some of those 4-Fs run pretty big.
I can't tell you how much it'll mean to me to get back and see my two girls.
- Daddy's home.
- I bet they've grown.
Probably shaving now.
- Is everybody all right?
- I'm going home, Radar.
- He's got an ulcer.
- Wow!
You lucky pup sir.
- Join us, Radar.
- Go get a sterile bottle and a clean nipple.
Oh, okay.
- Henry, we gotta throw the kid a farewell bash.
- "Absotively".
A monster, embarrassing blowout.
You can come as your favorite lamp shade.
- Here's to auld lang syne.
- Skoal.
A votre santé.
Keeps the doctor away.
-  - Who's there?
- Just a little bit ofheaven.
- Come in, Frank.
Hi, sweets.
You realize what Mclntyre's leaving means, don't you?
No, Frank.
What does it mean?
He'll be gone and he'll be here.
- They won't be them anymore.
They'll only be him.
- Right.
From now on, Margaret, instead of two against two - it's us against him, two against one.
- Fine.
Of course - I prefer one against one.
- Oh, please, Frank.
- Why so irritable, princess?
- I'm not irritable, Frank.
I'm just fat.
You have a fat, fat princess.
That just means there's more of you to love.
Then you agree I'm fat?
No, Margaret.
Not fat, fat.
You're sort of halfway between fat and thin leaning a little bit to the not fat, but rather the thin side of fat.
- In other words, fat.
- No, you're actually thin for a person that weighs as much as you do.
I'll tell you how thin I am not very.
Margaret, you're what I like to think of as full-bodied.
- Is that what you like to think of, Frank?
- All the time.
You're all nice and round and mushy and soft.
Unlike a certain person back home on whom I used to cut myself.
Hey, Frank.
What do you have to do this afternoon?
- Well, I'm garbage officer.
- The garbage can wait.
- The garbage can wait.
Do you realize, you lucky bugger, in a few days you're gonna be eating unpowdered food?
Wearing clothes made for humans?
Sleeping on clean sheets?
I don't think I can sleep on clean sheets anymore.
Why don't you take home a set of dirties?
The Garden of Allah.
And to think that I could call this home.
Fungus grows on you.
After you go, I'm having the place done over in deep-pile germs.
And I won't be here.
I'll make you a doggy bag of bacteria for the plane.
Here.
Take this.
I've read it eight times.
Sirs, you're looking at a dying man.
I got 20 minutes to live, tops.
My blood pressure is 200 over 310.
Stuffing cigars up your armpits again?
When it gets to 400, sell.
For now, exit laughing.
Sir, you're getting out on an ulcer.
How did you do it?
What did you think about?
How did you get it?
- I'm fertile, that's all.
- And he just didn't take any precautions.
- Bye, Klinger.
- "Bye, Klinger".
Every five minutes, "Bye, Klinger".
Well.
It's all yours, Hawk.
Gonna move out?
Be a good chance to get away from Frank.
No, I'll stay.
I wouldn't want a room without a Bible.
Thanks, Trap.
What?
You made it bearable.
I was lucky.
You were honest and open and let me lean on you.
No charge.
And if I'm ever back this way I'll keep a light burning for you in a bedpan.
Uh, yes, sir.
I'm writing it down.
Well, not really shorthand, sir.
Sort of long shorthand.
Yes, sir.
Hey, the troops are really doing it tonight, huh?
Where's Radar?
Anybody seen Radar?
Afraid somebody will step on him?
I got something for you, sir.
Save the present for the party, Radar.
No, it's a message from H.Q.
They got your X ray and your medical file and they approved your ulcer.
That's damn nice of them.
Uh, yeah.
Well, you report to Tokyo General for three weeks of therapy, antacid, planned diets, tranquilizers - the works.
- Is this some kind of an army screwup?
I'm going home.
No.
They said they don't send you home with an ulcer.
After you're cured at Tokyo General, they ship you off to another unit.
I could wind up in a place worse than this?
There's no place worse than this.
Well, they give you the choice of staying where you are and being cured.
This place gave me the ulcer.
It gave me the runs.
Look, Radar, don't say anything about this to anybody, okay?
I'll take care of it.
Oh, sure.
Listen, I'm sorry you're not going home, Trap.
- But I'm glad you're back.
- Thanks, Radar.
## I'm driving down to Seoul tomorrow night if that's of any interest to you.
I don't go out with married men, Colonel.
Well, neither do I. Henry's at 6,000 feet and holding.
You can do an appendectomy on him without an anaesthetic.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Here's the graduating class.
Pierce, we're losing our boy.
Well, we knew he'd leave us one day.
One of the best darn cutters in the whole shootin' match.
Both of you.
Won't be the same without you.
He's leaving.
You either.
Uh, Margaret, I should warn you.
Alcohol is quite fattening.
It's all right, Frank.
I plan to throw up later.
Could you do me a favor when you get stateside, sir?
I need a black evening bra.
- No man should be without one.
- I'll pay for it.
I got my mad money here someplace, sir.
Hold on to it, Klinger.
- Beat it.
- Yes, sir.
There you are, you.
You "aminal".
The major's a little snoggered.
How can you tell?
Well, Mclntyre.
I guess this is it.
I just wanted you to know I've always admired you.
- Always liked you.
- Thanks, Frank.
But I'm glad you're going.
Quiet, Frank, or I'll tie you to Emily Post.
- Frank.
We're having a little entertainment later.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, good.
I understand you play "America, the Beautiful" on the spoons.
Oh, well.
It's nothing really.
I'm sure.
If you come to my tent, I'll keep my flaps up.
I've been waiting a long time to tell you something, Captain Trapper "John-Intyre".
Really, Margaret?
I always watch you.
You wouldn't know that.
And every time you look when I'm looking, I watch something else so that you can't see that I've been looking when you're watching.
- I see.
- Especially when you play football in your bathing trunks.
And now, you're leaving.
And I'm stuck with needle-nose.
-  - Hold it down, everybody.
-  - Hold it down, everybody.
Let me have your attention.
Henry.
Yo.
As you all know, this is TrapperJohn's last party with us.
While we're all saddened that he's leaving we're gladdened that he's going home to the land of the all-night generator.
Good friend good companion.
He's taken a lot of the rottenness out of the war for all of us.
We'll miss his stupid laugh.
We'll miss his two good hands.
Honey, marriage has nothing to do with sex.
Now a few presents for the bar mitzvah boy.
- From the nurses -  From the nurses, a pair of all-weather pajamas, tops only.
- Hey.
- You'll get the bottoms a week after you're home.
From the enlisted men, a matched pair of cockroaches bronzed and suitable for use as cuff links.
You just killed my cuff links.
And from the hospital staff a record album for those quiet evenings after the day's surgery has been botched.
Sonja Henie Sings Figure Eights For You.
Speech, speech, speech.
Speech.
Thanks.
Thanks, really.
I, uh, I appreciate it.
But as someone once said, no good deed ever goes unpunished.
I'm staying.
That's right, no joke.
The army in its infinite insanity says I can't go home.
They've given me several options the least objectionable of which is staying here with with you idiots in this upholstered men's room.
And as for you, Margaret, I'll see you tomorrow night.
- Trap, you're kidding.
- I can kid better than that.
I'm buying.
Milk for everybody.
Awful.
That's awful.
Time for your medication.
Yeah.
Three more weeks, that's all.
You'll be up and playing the violin again.
Swell.
And I'm a ballerina.
- What's that?
- Tranquilizers.
They make you relax completely.
- They don't work.
- They do so.
Try it.
You first.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Major, you have the hands of a concert violinist.
He could've been a surgeon.
I'm running the show.
You're just the anesthetist today.
- I know.
It's your band, and I'm just a boy singer.
- Shh!
Now stepping mike-side, the lovely Hawkeye Pierce to sing the very haunting "Star Spangled Banner".
Officer?
Labbi Forbris?
- Keep walking, Margaret.
- Please!
Labbi Forbris.
- Frank!
- Just keep walking.
She probably wants to sell the baby.
You know how they are.
- Just a second.
- Lookee, missee.
Me sabe and Meme Sabe very busy working hard all night.
Chow time?
- Major?
- Maybe we should talk to her for a second.
That only puts another dollar in the bank of permissiveness.
Frank, I want to tell you what a great job you did this morning.
Skillful technique, O.R. Efficiency unparalleled.
- A superior team effort.
- Thank you very much.
Now if you could just get this back in.
- Hello, Chopper.
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Hawkeye.
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Don.
- Hello, Phil.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Rochester.
Hello, Mr. Benny.
How can you give thanks for food this bad?
Just being grateful for my daily bread.
My daily bread's four days old.
Mail call.
Father.
Ah, it's from my sister, the sister.
- Maria Angelica.
- I thought her name was Kathy.
Maria Angelica's the name she took as a nun.
- Her married name.
- No mail for me?
A cancelled subscription?
A lawyer letter?
An apology from my draft board?
It was all a mistake?
Something?
This one's marked, "Occupant, MASH 4077 th".
Sold.
I'll enjoy this after the afternoon prayer.
- Who's yours from, Trap?
- My five year old.
Or my wife has started writing in crayon.
- What's that?
- A picture of a barnyard.
If you can find the faces of ten United States presidents in this picture you can be the proud owner of a Shetland pony.
Hey, terrific.
I see one already right there.
Coolidge.
Right near the horse's tail.
That's one.
There's Teddy Roosevelt in the tree.
Bully, bully!
You trying to muscle in on our pony, Father?
Your films came, sir, from the Tabasco Film Company, Havana, Cuba.
Tee-riff!
Great.
Great.
"Yvonne, Renee and Loretta in What the Parrot Saw.
" - What's the other one say, sir?
- Oh, uh "Renee, Loretta and the Parrot in What Yvonne Saw.
" Uh, sir, could I watch the films with you this time with Captain Mclntyre and Pierce?
Ah, Radar, you'd be bored to death.
I mean, it's all medical stuff.
Uh-huh.
Here's a letter from your wife.
- Thank you, Radar.
- You're welcome.
Forbris, Forbris.
There was a Lieutenant Forbes.
Tall, thin guy.
Only dermatologist I ever knew with pimples.
- Maybe she's looking for Captain Forrest.
- Who?
The brain surgeon who fell down a lot.
No, no.
He's been gone over two years.
He's got a toy store now.
Read, please.
What?
"Labbi Forbris" is "rabbi for Bris".
Yes.
Yes.
Sang Min.
She's married to Walter R. Jacobson, Corporal.
This is their son, Sang MinJacobson who's too young to have a number yet.
"The father, busy at the front, is requesting that a circumcision be performed with a traditionalJewish ceremony, which is known as a Bris".
I'll do the circumcision but you're gonna have to get a Jewish chaplain to lay on the prayers.
- Can Father Mulcahy doJewish?
- Only if he can read Latin from right to left.
Talk to the father.
He's right inside.
He's got a black shirt, white collar.
Cross around the neck.
Oh, a padre.
Si.
We don't get a lot of those cases.
I don't remember a single soldier coming through in diapers before.
Doc, run to the Motor Pool.
I'll throw you a long one.
- Arm like a rifle.
- Hall of Famer.
Bet they retire your smock.
Guys, did I get a letter from my wife!
Oh, man!
Fantastic!
We're happy for you.
Did the movies come?
- Yeah.
What the Parrot Saw.
- I love animal films.
- What time is the screening?
- Midnight in the generator shed.
But never mind!
I've got to tell you about Lorraine's letter.
- Millard Fillmore.
- Hey, great!
Who?
We're gonna take your picture on a pony so you can send it home to your wife.
What pony?
Read this letter.
What a woman!
I bet there isn't a guy here in this godforsaken toilet with trees that's got his wife's permission to horse around.
- "Dear Henry".
- We read it, Henry.
"I know, darling, what you're going through the hardships, loneliness living in tents like animals".
- I didn't know animals lived in tents.
- Neither did I. "So if it should happen that you meet another woman" "So if it should happen that you meet another woman someone who is kind, I would certainly understand, my darling".
- Can you believe her?
- I'm still having trouble believing you.
- That's great.
- Yeah.
You said something about taking a picture.
- Could we do it now?
I'd like to send it to her.
- We don't have the pony yet.
Oh, okay.
- Prince.
- Lightning.
- Norman.
- Buck.
Norman's a great name for a pony.
The other horses'll make fun of him.
Yeah.
And he'll probably have to wear glasses.
Well, there's Captain Epstein.
He's a very fine Jewish chaplain.
We went through indoctrination together.
Lovely fellow, Eppy.
Water-skier, paratrooper.
A bit meshuga, actually.
-  - He's with the 109th.
However, he's not Orthodox.
He's Conservative.
Oh, I don't think she'd want anything flashy.
If you can't get Captain Epstein, try the Navy, Marines.
Let's get this little fellow taken care of.
It's a lovely boy.
Did I remember to give you that letter from your sister?
Yes, yes.
I was about to read it.
Please, don't be worried about the circumcision.
Some of my best friends have had one.
Thank you, Father.
Thank you.
#Kyrie eleison # - Fragment at L-3, one centimeter.
- L-3.
Compression fracture, L-4, lesions and trauma.
-  Finished.
- Good.
That O.D. T-shirt makes me crazy.
I wanted to bite you in the chow line.
I didn't see anything.
You seen anything, Trap?
- I didn't see a thing.
- We were simply checking spines.
Did you find out you each had one?
Would you make up I don't know which one of you is more obscene.
- He is.
We took a poll.
- What are you doing?
Is thatJames Buchanan under the haystack?
What would a president be doing under a haystack?
What am I doing in South Korea without a paddle?
What's this I hear about you performing a "cirky" on an infant?
- That's elective surgery.
- Against regulations.
So is groping in the X ray room without leather aprons.
The mother and child happen to be dependents of an American soldier.
Isn't that John Quincy Adams?
That dependent card and letter could be forgeries.
Sounds like one of their rackets to me.
Right.
She gets rich taking her baby around to hospitals getting him circumcised.
Come on, Major.
Going to do more research?
Pace yourself, kids.
It might be a long war.
Right there.
That big red apple.
Ulysses S. Grant's nose.
Hey, you guys think my wife could have a guilty conscience?
What are you talking about?
Where'd you get an idea like that?
- I saw that.
- Read between the lines.
Mmmm.
Mmmm.
Mmmm.
- He's right, Henry.
That's exactly what it says.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.
-  Why?
Why?
The country club.
That's what it is.
That country club.
- Right.
- A thousand dollars to join, - For what?
- What?
Heartbreak, that's what.
Nothing but heartbreak.
Say good morning to the pro, and he sells you an alpaca sweater.
Right.
That was the 109th.
Captain Epstein's been rotated to Temple Beth El in Buffalo.
- Who?
- The chaplain that does water-skiing and circumcisions.
Hey, those are good hobbies.
I used to collect butterflies.
I never caught any, though.
I got a sick moth once.
He was eating my father's blue serge, and I slammed the closet door on him.
- I'll try someone else.
- All right.
Nah.
Lorraine would never do anything wrong.
Who am I speaking to?
Uh, Corporal Sweeny?
You guys got a rabbi down there?
It's for a Bris.
It's like a christening performed on newborn male personnel who areJewish Hebrews.
Right, you go look.
I'll wait.
It's all in your imagination, Henry.
I don't know.
I've seen those single guys checking on the wives at the club.
Them and their brown and white wing-tip shoes.
They don't care.
You know, one hot night a couple summers ago one of'em cut in on me and Lorraine at the dance.
He didn't even have the decency to hold her with a hanky over his hand.
Next dance with me, she had a soggy back.
- You're doing the jack story, Henry.
- I know what started it.
She took up tennis.
She wears those short, little skirts.
Lorraine has gorgeous legs since her varicose vein operation.
- Have a drink, Henry.
- What legs.
Sailor followed her once four blocks and she was wearing orthopedic shoes.
Maybe it would help if you took a long walk in a mine field.
- Have a talk with Father Mulcahy.
- Well Hey!
Now that's a good idea.
I just won't mention that the country club doesn't allow Catholics.
Kathy, Kathy, Kathy.
How could you think of such a thing?
Father?
Father, I've got to talk to you about my wife.
My sister wants to leave the order.
There's guilt all over this letter.
She's such a fantastic nun.
I'd stack her up against any nun in the business.
I gave her whatever she needed, even if she didn't want it.
God smiled on her from the start.
Imagine!
A basketball scholarship at the Holy Name Academy.
Appendices, adenoids, tonsils.
I took something out of every member of her family.
And all freebies.
She's been teaching.
She loves children.
Now she thinks she might like one of her own.
Lorraine can be a little flirty especially after a couple of Scotch and Seven-Ups.
Now she wants my approval.
I don't know what to tell her.
- I don't know what to say.
-  I think I got a Bris guy zeroed in on the carrier Essex.
Oh, good, Radar.
Stay on it.
Yes, Father, sir.
Well, anything else, Colonel?
No.
No, thank you, Father.
It certainly helps to talk to someone about these things who's sympathetic.
Anytime, my son.
What's your diagnosis?
We got it isolated.
At exactly 1400 hours.
It isn't a president's face, but it's political-looking.
- It's a cow chip.
- Keep searching.
One more president to go, and we're pony owners.
She's such a fantastic nun.
One of your top nuns.
Radar, who do I see about getting an emergency furlough?
- First you see the chaplain.
- But I am the chaplain.
Right.
Then he, who is in your case you, contacts the Red Cross which gets back to you, since you're him.
- How's that?
-  No kidding?
Great!
We got a Jewish chaplain, Father.
Go ahead.
Lieutenant Commander Cornfield.
He's on the carrier Essex off Inchon.
I can reach him by code for the next four hours.
Do I know what you're saying?
He could radio us the Bris ceremony, and you officiate.
Oh, yes, yes.
That'll work.
Tell the rabbi roger, kosher and out.
- You're both gonna be sorry.
- Very sorry.
I found a way to have tangible evidence that you will have performed elective surgery.
- And there'll be none of your weaseling out of it.
- Have you finished?
- I have.
- Your fly is untied.
- Really!
- Colonel, do you realize No, Frank.
Or, yes, Frank.
Whichever you prefer to hear.
I'm sure of it now, guys.
I even know who it is.
Lyle Pendergrast.
Always kissing her hand.
One time he got his mustache caught in her ring.
- Wow, his eyes watered.
- Henry!
You know what I've been doing?
Crying.
I never cry.
I never cried as a kid.
Go ahead.
Hit me on the arm as hard as you can.
I won't cry.
- Go on.
- It's no sin to cry.
It is in Bloomington.
Tractor tipped over on my father once and he walked five miles into the woods to scream.
Why don't you patch through to the States and call your wife?
As soon as you hear her voice, you'll realize that everything is okay.
For a second, I thought you were gonna say "hunky-dory".
It crossed my mind.
Yeah, I'll hear her voice.
We'll talk about the kids and I'll hear the dog barking in the yard.
Let it all out, Henry.
Come on.
I'm not gonna cry.
I'm not gonna cry.
Watch.
Yeah, right.
One sec.
Sir?
Your call to Bloomington.
- It's Mrs. Colonel, your wife, sir.
- Oh.
- You look fine, sir.
- Can you tell I've been crying?
- No.
- Good.
You can only have two minutes on the line.
That's all I could get.
Hi, Lorraine.
It's me, Henry.
Oh, I'm, uh I'm fine, dear.
How are you?
Oh, swell, honey.
Kids good?
Terrific.
No, no, no.
I'm still here at the war.
No, I haven't been shot or anything.
The latrine caught fire the other day.
I was in it.
But nothing important got burned, just a little singed.
What?
Well, yes.
Yes, there is something l You're gonna think this is really silly.
I mean, it's gonna make you laugh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, uh Lorraine, I want you to be as honest with me as I've always tried to be with you.
I mean, your letter today.
Uh, your last letter?
It could be interpreted as Who?
Al Franklin?
Do I know him?
Yeah, I know him.
Tall guy, 12 handicap, drives a yellow Jag.
The Pumpkin Dance at the country club?
Uh-huh.
Ah, Lorraine!
Lorraine!
An orthodontist!
Well, I mean, honey, don't, don't cry.
Please don't cry.
All right, Lorraine.
Go ahead, cry.
Yeah.
Yes, l I know the movie, Brief Encounter.
What a Lorraine, that's only a movie!
I Lorraine?
Lorraine?
Sir, Lieutenant Commander Cornfield is standing by on the Essex.
- We're ready to start the ceremony.
- Ceremony?
Yeah.
TheJacobson kid, Sang Min?
- Go ahead, Radar.
Whatever.
- Yes, sir.
It's clean, sir.
Oh, Lorraine.
Orthodontist!
Testing.
One, two, three, four.
Testing.
Mea culpa.
Mea culpa.
Have you got the chair, Father?
Oh, right.
They're ready on board the Essex.
You ready to perform?
# Mi-mi-mi-mi # Ready.
- What's the chair for?
- For the standby father.
Will you sit on it?
And keep your hands on the baby.
- Sit down.
It lets you use your best part.
- Bring in the child.
Uh, Father, the first thing to say is "Repeat after me.
May he who comest be blessed".
Repeat after me.
May he who comest be blessed.
-  May he who comest be blessed.
- Go ahead, Radar.
"Happy is he whom thou choosest and bringest, uh, nigh".
"Happy is he whom thou choosest and bringest nigh that he may dwell in thy courts".
I warned you.
This is elective surgery.
I'm taking pictures.
- F-28.
It's dark in here.
- Right.
Frank, have you been sniffing medical samples again?
Uh         Uh, now, Father, you put a drop of wine in the baby's mouth.
A drop of wine in the baby's mouth.
God of our fathers, preserve this child and let his name be called in Israel Sang Min, son of Walter R. Let us rejoice.
They're fading, Father.
Wait a minute.
I've lost the Essex.
We've lost them, and I don't think we're finished.
Everybody.
- Amen.
-  Amen.
- Shall I diaper, Doctor?
- Yes, and then the baby.
Shall we head for the sponge cake?
- You did good work, Doctor.
- When did I not?
- Hey.
- What?
I think I know where the face of the tenth president is.
Aha!
Got it!
Got every bit of it on film.
Really?
Let's see.
- Hey, he's right.
- Ahh.
I had my eyes closed there.
- The baby's cute.
- Did you have to pull it out in this room?
- Couldn't you wait until we got to the tent?
-   When I saw the little mother holding that child she was the happiest person I'd seen in my life.
I thought perhaps my sister should have a chance at that.
So if she must, she'll have my blessing.
- ## -  Come on.
We gotta practice for our pony.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
#America, I love you # #You're like a sweetheart of mine # -  - #From ocean to ocean # # For you my devotion is touching each boundary line # #Just like a little baby # -  - Sound!
What's with the sound?
Come on, let's hear it!
Hold your bloomers!
Draw me another martini.
Attention all personnel.
Seoul H.Q. Reports that rain is expected this evening.
A lot they know.
What's it about?
This girl goes to the big city and loses her voice.
- Care for a martini?
- I had an apple in my tent.
You really know how to live.
Klinger, what about the sound?
You ask for sound and you get water.
That's show business.
- Sure you don't want a martini?
- Does it mix with apples?
- Was Lincoln a car?
- Maybe a sip.
- Ohh.
- Nutritious and character-building.
#And there's a hundred million others like me #   # Like me ##  What is this?
Come on, will ya?
- Listen.
- Let's blow.
Wait till the crowd thins out.
It'll be easier to get a cab.
- The evening is still young.
You got any plans, Lieutenant?
- I'm going straight to bed.
- Best offer I've had all night.
- Bye-bye.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
It's 8:30.
It's pouring.
No movie.
No soft personnel.
I'd rather be down in Seoul hearing Henry's lecture.
Colonel Blake reviews the military position on the hemorrhoid?
I'd rather be here.
Sitting on my own.
I'm gonna get in trouble for this, sir.
Captain Mclntyre and Pierce are gonna kill me.
I'm in command until Colonel Blake's absence is replaced with his presence.
That still is coming down.
Captain Pierce calls it his "wellspring of life".
That's just something he read in Cosmopolitan.
- What the hell's goin' on?
- He's taking apart the still!
Are you bonkers, Frank?
What for?
Don't you use that tone with me!
Ah, sir, may I be excused?
I think I'm getting a sty.
Yes, yes, you little coward!
He made me, uh l  Is it broken?
Testing, one, two, three.
Ahh!
Nectar of the gods.
Mother's milk.
You two are alcoholics.
Hopeless, elbow-bending boozers.
In your ear.
Oh, yeah, boy?
"From the deputy assistant undersecretary of defense on drug and alcohol abuse.
"Surveys have shown that 57.230 of all military personnel in the Asian Theater have a drinking problem".
We do not have a drinking problem.
- Right, Smedley?
- Righto.
They've enclosed a test.
Do you think there's too much vermouth in this?
Not for me.
It's a little more ginny than the last batch, though.
Mmm.
Maybe, maybe.
First question: "Do you think and talk about drinking often"?
- No, of course not.
I see what you mean about the gin.
- Hell, no!
"Do you sometimes gulp drinks"?
Ahh.
Never.
"Do you sometimes forget what happened while you were drinking"?
What?
Question number three: "Do you sometimes forget what happened while you were drinking"?
- What happened to question number two?
- He forgot it.
He forgets while we drink.
- The answer to question number three is no.
- There's just no question.
You're alcoholics!
You drink constantly!
All right, we drink.
We drink so we can get through these lousy, stinking, 48-hour days.
- We're cold, filthy, lonely.
- Scared, bored, tired.
Frightened and very drowsy.
And on top of that, Alice Faye goes to the big city and loses her voice.
- She didn't?
- Yeah!
We need a drink!
I don't give one whit about your personal problems.
I hereby declare this unit dry.
Total prohibition!
And that is an official order!
Boy, when you make it official, you make it official!
omnibus, pro quibus illud obtuli sit te miserante propitiabile.
Per Christum Dominum nostrum.
Amen.
Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus Pater et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.
Nice service, Father.
Oh, Klinger.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
You're the only one who ever comes to Sunday services.
You're a very religious man.
I'm really an atheist.
But it gives me a chance to wear my white gloves.
Oh.
How's your section eight coming along?
I don't think the dresses are working.
I may have to reenlist to prove I'm crazy.
- Father, we got a problem.
- Frank Burns tore down our still and hid it.
- While we were in surgery.
- Ain't you gonna say anything about my outfit?
- Later.
- Say something nice about his gloves.
- Huh?
- His gloves.
I love your gloves, Klinger.
Sears catalog.
They were having a white sale.
You trace your hands on paper to give 'em your right size.
However, if you want the black You really don't care, do you?
I'm sorry your still is broken, Hawkeye.
Did you want to pray for it or anything?
Father, what we wanted was a drink.
We've been in the O.R. All night.
- We operated on everything but each other.
- You got some sacramental wine?
Well, yes, I have.
But the drinking of it is part of a religious service.
You have to be a priest.
- Ordain us.
- There isn't time for that.
- Ordain us.
- There isn't time for that.
My confession alone would take a year.
I'm sorry I can't help you.
You'll have to excuse me.
It's time for 11:00 Protestant services.
- Do you wanna pray for booze?
- I'll try anything.
Oh, well how nice.
Go ahead.
My friends, let's open our service today by singing hymn 216 on page 50 of your green book.
#All things bright and beautiful # #All creatures great and small ## It's true, Margaret.
Leadership is a lonely thing but the satisfactions are overwhelming.
Oh, Frank, every day you remind me more and more of Dad.
The colonel?
Your natural leadership, the receding hairline those two warts on your back.
I could've gotten an appointment to West Point but my congressman was a Lithuanian.
Foreign.
Help me a minute.
-  - What?
You should've seen those "hooch hounds," Pierce and Mclntyre when I outlawed alcohol on this post.
Hmph!
They were furious when I took away their "glug-glug".
You deactivated their still?
- And mothballed it.
- And outlawed And they claim they're not alcoholics.
These childish, silly reasons for their drinking.
"I'm cold, I'm bored, I'm frightened".
Frank?
Darling.
I have a confession to make.
- Margaret!
- It's an heirloom given to Mother by Father on their bridal night.
"To my buttercup, from Alvin.
"The best things are worth waiting for.
Bottoms up".
Well, it's very nice to carry fruit juice, lemonade, whatever.
- Frank, I carry brandy.
- I didn't hear that!
Sometimes I can't make it without it.
I'm cold and frightened too.
My baby.
Don't take away my little "nippy" bottle.
It's only got a drop or two in it.
It's all right, darling.
In In your case, it's nerve medicine.
-  - Shoot!
- What is it, Corporal?
- Uh, uh, the - Well?
What is it?
- The daily report needs to be signed, sir.
I didn't see anything unusual, sir.
- Come on, come on, fingers.
- I'm trying to find the right key.
- That looks right.
- My wife's car.
What are you doing with it over here?
She's a lousy driver.
- What's that for, her chastity belt?
- Get off it.
Well, you won't let her drive.
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol.
Lousy Frank's hidden every drop in the camp.
He's a fink, Frank.
A "frink" is what he is.
But we'll get around him or my name's not whatever my name is.
Potassium permanganate.
Huh.
It'll kill you, but you won't have fungus of the stomach.
- I need the real thing.
-   How 'bout a little light, Margaret?
Don't wanna strain your eyes.
I was just checking supplies.
- A tireless worker.
- A beautiful soul.
- You're the woman my mother always hoped I'd be.
- Give us a shot, Margaret.
Shot?
This is just medicine.
Tell us what it is, we'll get the disease.
It makes it 100%% .
This place is now bone dry.
Yes, sir.
The men detest me, don't they?
- Oh, no, sir.
- You can tell the truth.
They hate me, don't they?
Just your guts, sir.
This is for their own good.
They don't have to love me.
I'm sure they'll be very happy to hear that, Major.
You don't have to stand there talking to me.
Go to sleep.
I can do both at the same time.
- Good night, Corporal.
- Good night, uh, sir.
# I wish there were a radio way up in heaven # # So I could say hello to Mother every day ## I didn't know you could sing.
- Was I singing?
I thought I was dancing.
-  What the devil's going on in here?
Frank, baby!
# Come on in, take off your skin and rattle around in your bones # # Come on in, take off your skin and rattle around # # Rattle around in your bones ## - Major Houlihan!
- Whoop!
This really cuts me to the quick!
That's quite all right.
His quick could use some cutting.
Let me have that.
- Where did this liquor come from?
- Oh, shh!
It's a secret.
- Don't tell anybody.
- Don't tell anyone.
- As your commanding officer, I insist!
- Shh!
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
You take 11 string beans, one onion half a radish and four "banamas".
Right, "banamas".
You mix it all up and you and you let it soak for six weeks.
-  Days.
- Days.
You better write this down.
Then you look around and you find the tallest tree and you hang the stuff in an "emena" bag.
And you let it lay there for 18 weeks.
-  Days.
- Days.
Thank you.
That tears it!
From now on, anyone anyone caught with any kind of intoxicating beverage - will be severely disciplined!
- No one!
We'll drink to that!
Who was that?
Have you ever given a lecture on temperance, Father?
On the evils of drink?
Well, no, I haven't.
But on the troop ship, I was asked to give a lecture on the sex thing.
- Good!
- Well, being celibate, I didn't feel qualified.
They called in a Protestant.
He had a film.
About two sailors.
One was from Cleveland, ostensibly and the other from a small, rural area.
The city boy decided to stay on his ship and write his high school sweetheart.
Lovely young girl, with a megaphone on her chest.
Father, please, this is important.
The country boy got mixed up with a young lady who lived in a trailer with three other young ladies and a man with a whip.
- Father - Broke his wristwatch and everything.
Father Mulcahy.
I need a fire and brimstone lecture on the evils of drink.
- Can you do it?
- I'm sure I can.
But no one ever comes to any of my services.
I'm not very magnetic.
Oh, they'll be there.
It'll be a general order.
No one will be excused.
Well, I'll try, sir.
I won't be alone.
He'll be by my side.
If He only had a film.
Move your thumb, and put a retractor in here instead.
I don't have three hands.
Ask a nurse to do it, Doctor!
- More suction.
- If I want more suction, I'll ask for more suction.
More suction.
That boy was full of shrapnel.
You're kidding?
I thought he swallowed the egg money.
- You did a good job, Doctor.
- Who asked you?
Dr. Schweitzer's in a hurry for his organ lesson.
I'm not worthy of you, Frank.
You try, Margaret.
That's what counts.
I'm willing to forgive.
I'm willing to forget because it's something I'll always remember.
Oh, Frank, you're so above average.
Attention!
Father Mulcahy's temperance lecture is scheduled for 1300 hours.
No personnel will be excepted by order of Major Frank Burns, temporary commander and surgeon.
This is one personnel that's not going.
The instrument has yet to be invented which can measure my indifference to that remark.
You use my razor?
I've had several complaints about my armpits.
You've got Field and Stream mixed in with my Joys of Nudity.
Big deal.
I'd rather see a naked girl than a canoe built in a dentist's garage.
This blade is dull.
Well, if the blade fits Always a shot, always the needle.
Mr. Glib.
Never at a loss for words.
Run up an alley and holler "fish".
Oh, clever.
Very clever.
Aah!
Field and Stream.
How can you read this stuff?
Listen, I'm so bored, I'm rereading my draft notices.
"How to Wrap a Grizzly Bear for Mailing".
You used my towel.
I left a quarter.
- Popular Mechanics?
- Save that.
I'm making a lamp out of a lawn mower.
You know something?
You're a slob.
A slob!
A real slob!
- I'm a slob?
- Yeah!
Whose toenails are always under my bed with nobody in 'em?
- So they jump when I cut 'em.
- Point your feet out the door.
You don't suppose it's true?
- What true?
- That we're alcoholics.
If I thought that, I'd rent myself out to a firing squad.
Right.
Very good.
I can take it or leave it.
Then why are you afraid to go to the lecture?
- Five bucks.
- Deal.
After you used that filthy towel?
It's really filling up, Father.
Already?
I can't believe it.
Oh, sweet Mary.
I've never had an audience this size.
You're shaking, Father.
Well, drinking is not my best subject.
"Turning the Other Cheek," "The Prodigal Son".
I'm better with the standards.
Father, maybe a little bracer?
Something to calm you down?
- You have anything around here?
- Oh.
In my desk there's a bottle of some sorts, I think.
The gift of a young marine.
A thank you for a very successful confession.
This'll get you there.
And back!
Frank, what a turnout.
Lemmings must be directed to the sea.
You're magic with a phrase.
Winston Churchill said, "Men can move mountains with words".
His mother was American, you know.
So was mine.
Frank, look at the door.
How 'bout sucking in your shoulders?
Pardon my build.
Hi.
Move your keister.
- Couldn't just slide over, huh?
- Go mail a bear.
Sound!
Where's the sound?
- Will you move over?
- Lard butt!
- Excuse me.
- Better be good, Father.
Ziegfeld's out front.
My friends, let me quote from Leviticus 10.
"Do not drink wine or strong drink, thou "nor thy sons with thee "when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die;  It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
" My friends, the Lord said this to Aaron after the passing away of his beloved sons, Nadab and Abi'hu.
It's rather warm in here.
Radar, would you open one of the stained glass windows?
My friends let me quote Leviticus 10.
"Do not drink wine or strong drink, thou nor thy sons with thee".
-  We saw this.
- Shh.
Friends, let me tell you something however compulsory it may be.
There's no film.
I am live.
Now back to where we were when you last heard from me.
It was with Leviticus on the tenth, I believe.
"Drink thee not "nor thee, thou sons "lest ye die.
Nor congregate at the corner tabernacle".
I'd like to take a short sabbatical or a cup of coffee.
Or I wonder, is there a doctor in the tent?
- Father, are you all right?
- Ow!
- Get your big feet out of the way!
- My big feet?
Please don't rise.
- Ow!
- Frank?
That's it, everybody.
The 18th Amendment has been repealed!
Have I ever told you folks the one about the prodigal son?
Retraction.
- Suction, please.
- Yes, Doctor.
Very nice.
Very neat.
Thank you, Doctor.
Pierce, Mclntyre?
- Yo?
- We're still here, Frank.
Now tell the truth.
Don't you feel better for drinking less?
Absolutely!
My skin is clear, my eyes are bright, my tummy loves me again.
Good.
Now just remember.
Moderation.
No more secret drinking.
Right.
Have you made the incision, Doctor?
- Yep.
- Nurse, two straws, please.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Give me some 3-O chromic, Mr. Kwang.
- Yes, Doctor.
-   You're welcome, sir.
- I didn't ask for a Kelly clamp, Nurse!
- But you did, sir.
- Don't argue with the surgeon.
-  Everyone's a surgeon.
I wouldn't let him cut the giblets out of a turkey.
He'd probably give it cranberry complications.
- Now the Kelly.
-  Yes, Doctor.
Major, may I have a nurse to work with who isn't quite so smug?
- I'll take over here, Baker.
You're tired.
- I'm perfectly fine.
- I said you're tired.
That's an order.
-  Get off her back.
- She's my nurse.
- I'll give you $500 for her.
- Sold!
- You report to my quarters.
Major Burns will show you how to get there.
Sir?
Major Houlihan requests permission to see the colonel.
Well, tell her I died of a hangover and didn't leave a forwarding address.
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel, I want a few words with you.
I just hope I can hear you over the tom-toms.
- I think you'll be able to hear me all right.
- Here's some black coffee, sir.
- God bless you, Radar.
- Hope so, sir.
- Colonel.
- Radar, turn on the news.
Maybe the war just ended, and I won't have to talk to her.
Yes, sir.
I'll get you that station right away.
Colonel Blake, I wish to charge LieutenantJanet Baker with insubordination and I insist on your assurance that she will be given prompt and vigorous punishment.
Major, there's a French unit right down the road.
Why don't you run down there and see if you can borrow their guillotine?
- Ha!
- Don't do that.
- I want her placed under bed arrest.
- Bed what?
When she's not on duty and other than at meal times she is to sit on the edge of her bed at attention for one month.
Oh, be reasonable, Major.
You can't keep a nurse in bed for a month.
Although there are a few people who have tried it.
Well, you're certainly proving your lack of usual help.
Boy, Major, you and your nurses can be pains in the royal butt.
If you're not in here every five minutes with a lot of bugle oil about how you can't control them, they're here complaining you're Hermann Goering in drag.
Which one of them said that?
I'm not finking, Major.
I'm not gonna have you chain some poor little nurse to her cot or set her adrift in a bedpan.
Then you don't mind if I go over your head again?
Just so long as it's on tiptoe.
I think H.Q. Would be very interested to learn that this unit is commanded by an inept incompetent who runs down his chief nurse every chance he gets!
Speaking man-to-man, Colonel, I realize the war unhinges us all.
If we were to take off our uniforms, we could possibly become friends.
That fact aside, your conduct is so beneath contempt that I won't lower myself to elevate it.
- Good day, sir!
- Uh-huh.
- Sir!
H.Q. Just called.
They said we could be expecting an enemy attack.
Radar, that's the nicest thing I've heard today.
- #When I die # -  #When I die # - #And it won't be long # - #And it won't be long # - # Hey, you're gonna be sorry # - # Hey, you're gonna be sorry # - #That you treated me wrong # - #That you treated me wrong # - #Yeah, you're gonna be sorry # - # Hey, you're gonna be sorry # - #That you treated me bad # - #That you treated me bad #  #And if there's an afterlife, I'll go, then I'll be glad ## Hey, Calvin, Trap.
- Hey, where are the nurses going, Radar?
- 44th Field Hospital with all the wounded that can be moved.
It looks like we maybe might get hit by an enemy paratroop drop.
- Got any other good news?
- Christmas canceled?
Pentagon been enlarged?
- Lassie been spayed?
- What do you want from me?
I'm just as unhappy as you.
- Believe me, we're unhappier.
- Because we're taller.
Together, we're at least two feet unhappier than you are.
- You hear the news?
- If you were a nurse, we'd be shipping you to the 44th.
If I was a nurse, I'd be home now, pregnant.
Detail forward!
March!
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Detail halt!
One, two!
I want foxholes there, there, there and there each smartly dug the kind of hole a man can throw himself into with pride.
Detail dig!
Two, three, four!
- Hello, Frank.
- I've heard that before.
Turning the compound into a putting course, Frank?
Instead of standing around cracking wise, you might want to set an example for the men.
- I'd rather set an example for the women.
- Oh, put a sock on it.
Attention, all nurses.
Please be prepared to leave in one hour.
One hour till the nurses go.
-  - Come in.
- Just one second, bunny.
- Sure.
- What do you want?
- Major Burns says he'll be detained a little late.
He's having himself lowered into the ground to show the right height for how low a foxhole should be dug down so you can stand up into it.
- Thank you.
- Can I help you with anything, Major?
- Packing?
- No.
Thank you.
But that's very kind of you, Corporal.
- Did I ever tell you how much you look like my sister?
- No.
- Except you're a lot older.
- That would be your younger sister?
- No.
She's 37.
- Don't slam the door.
Am I leaving?
- I'm going to miss you something awful.
-  - Oh.
- Did you know you had this thing back here?
- What thing?
- My tongue.
Oh.
Oh.
- Why are all the great guys married?
- Who said I was?
- You did.
-  That's my best nose.
Stuff your nose.
Do you mind?
I paid good money for this supply room.
-  - Come in, Frank.
- You didn't use our secret knock.
- Frank, the whole camp knows our secret knock.
The degenerates!
Completely preoccupied with pleasures of the flesh.
Oh, Margaret!
To think I won't have this neck to nuzzle these lobes to nibble.
- It's gonna be sheer hell.
- Oh, how those dirty words inflame me!
I'll call you from the 44th, first chance.
To become just a disembodied voice.
When we've spent all this time being so embodied.
- For you, darling.
- Oh.
Frank, is that what I think it is?
Hair.
Mine.
There's six months' haircuts in there.
- For me?
- I was saving them for my mother.
She glues my hair into the shape of flowers, puts them under glass.
Frank, I think your mother should have this.
Please.
I'm a big boy, Margaret.
I'm over 21.
I can give my hair to anyone I please.
Please.
Keep it.
If anything should happen if we never see each other again at least you can always run your fingers through the envelope.
Oh.
Ohh.
Ready to roll, Colonel.
- See you in a few days.
- Hopefully.
Major.
Captain.
- Captain.
- Major.
Pierce!
Colonel!
- Cut it out, Pierce.
- I'd like to leave a call for 8:30.
That has to be an affront to every decent army officer back to George Washington.
Major.
- Did you know that Washington's false teeth were made out of wood?
- Really?
- Martha's lips were always full of slivers.
-  - Let's get this show on the road.
-  Hold it!
-  Klinger, that's desertion.
- No, sir.
Honest.
I just fell asleep in here, I swear.
All right.
Take it away.
-  -  I'd like a dry martini, Mr. Kwak a very dry martini.
A very dry, arid, barren, desiccated veritable dust bowl of a martini.
I want a martini that can be declared a disaster area.
- Mix me just such a martini.
- With two straws.
Make it to go, please.
I'd like to drink it in the States.
- Boy, do I miss my wife.
- So do I. - I don't even know your wife, and I miss her.
- I'll miss my wife.
- You miss my mother.
- Fence builder.
- What's he up to?
- You mean, what's he upside down to, Frank?
He says he's gonna stay that way until the nurses come back.
- Off your head and on your feet, Spalding!
- Yes, sir.
We happen to be under blackout conditions, gentlemen.
- We're still at war, you know.
- I guess that explains all the boom-booms.
That sassy jabber is wasted on me, Captain Wiseapple.
I'm miserable enough, Frank.
Don't start with me or I'll give you a nose job from the inside.
You'd better get out of here, Frank.
He doesn't care anymore.
He's wanted in five states now.
Oh, you phony baloneys!
Forget it.
When the nurses come back, I'll be tossed aside like an old shoe.
- Here's your guitar, Captain.
- Thanks, Klinger.
- Give me a beer, Mr. Kwak.
- If they come back.
- Boy, I miss your mother.
- Would you like to see her picture again?
I've seen every picture of every female that's in this camp.
There's that reel under Frank's bunk we've never seen.
That's probably just a movie of Frank's parents being told he died at birth.
They'll be back.
- ##  - Dry, Mr. Kwak.
Dry, drier, driest.
Unwet.
The ultimate, the perfect martini a drink that's dying of thirst.
#And I wonder if they miss us # # Now, wouldn't that be funny # # Now that we're without them # #We can hardly stand ourselves # # Well, it's funny when they're here # #How we take for granted # # The way they taste The way they feel # # Their sight, their smell their sound # #And it's funny when they're gone # #Just how bad we miss them # #And how life can be so empty # #When they're not around # #And I wonder if they miss us # #Now, wouldn't that be funny # #Now that we're without them # #We can hardly stand ourselves ## Oh.
Yeah, okay.
I got it.
Right.
- Well, what's the poop?
- Huh?
Oh, uh, the nurses all arrived safely at the 44th.
We're still expecting an enemy parachute drop but we can't evacuate due to the constant inflow of wounded.
Let the enemy come.
We'll show them American guts in action.
I think mine have started already, sir.
- Choppers.
-   M.A.S.H.
, 4077 th.
Attention.
Attention, all personnel.
Incoming Incoming wounded arriving by vehicle plus choppers on both upper and lower pads.
All available personnel will report to the O.R. To help with nursing chores.
We need lots of hands.
-  -  -  - Just look this way, Father, where the blood is.
- Rake retractor, Father.
- Uh, rake Uh.
- Rake.
It's at the end of the tray there.
- Oh.
Sorry.
That's all right.
You're all heart.
Unfortunately, you're all thumbs as well.
- Suction.
- Suction?
It's the thing that goes  - My kingdom for a nurse.
- I'm doing my best.
If you don't start handing me instruments the right way, I'm gonna cut you off at the knees.
I thought he was cut off at the knees.
- Klinger, you're standing in my light.
- Whatever I do is no good.
If Hot Lips were here right now, I'd kiss her feet.
And bump into Frank coming around the toe?
Okay, Klinger, give me the clamp, give me the clamp.
- Thataboy.
- Three-O silk on a cutting needle, Mr. Kwang.
Let's keep those sponges coming, Father.
"Nurse" is also a verb.
Margaret!
Oh, Margaret, I'm so glad I could get through to you.
I Just a minute, darling.
- How are you, precious?
- Fine now, darling.
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm just a wreck without you.
Honest.
The only thing that keeps me going are the letters from my wife.
Really, Frank?
Just letters?
No packages?
She hasn't knitted you a divorce?
Sorry, Margaret.
How do you like the 44th?
Any handsome doctors up there?
Are you still expecting an attack?
That's what we hear.
We're ready for it.
I've got the whole place organized.
Of course, Pierce and Mclntyre have been no help.
- Last night, they filled my foxhole with peas and carrots.
- Oh, dear.
And then they put a whoopee cushion in my helmet liner.
You're bigger than they are, Frank.
We both know that.
Margaret, are there there?
Are there what here?
Margaret, falling for me, I realized how easily you can be taken in by a handsome face.
- You're not jealous?
- I'm a doctor, Margaret.
But if I caught you with another man, I'd blow my brains out and then kill both of you.
- Did you hear what you said?
You got it all backwards.
-  I mean, I'd kill both of you and then I'd kill myself.
Seriously, Frank.
Knowing you'd kill me somehow makes my life worthwhile.
Well, I wouldn't kill just anyone, Margaret.
I've gotta go now, darling.
I love you.
I love you.
- Hang up, Frank.
- You hang up first.
Frank, that's so high school.
Let's count to three, and then we'll hang up together.
- Okay, you start.
- One.
- Two.
- Three!
Get 'em, Frank!
Pierce!
Mclntyre!
Stop!
Wait!
Hold it!
- Stop!
-   Help!
Help!
Oh!
Now, cut that out.
Help!
Stop that jeep!
Let me out of here!
Let me out!
- Why, that's amazing, Frank.
- Camouflaging yourself as a jeep.
You get the film.
I'll get the projector and popcorn.
You can't park a jeep over a superior officer!
Let me out!
If this belongs to Frank, you can be sure it's not a girlie movie.
- You never can tell, Henry.
- We just heard Frank make a semi-obscene phone call.
- Right.
No further word about the enemy attack, sir.
- Good, good.
There will be no enemy attack.
My personal theory is that the Chinese just sent headquarters a threatening fortune cookie.
Get the window, Klinger.
-  Don't stand in the light.
-  You heartbreaker.
- Everyone comfortable?
- Not for a year now.
- Let her rip, Henry.
- You got it.
- I think I saw this movie.
- Oh, pipe down.
- Radar, get your hand off my knee.
- That's not funny!
Come on.
Get out of the way.
- "I've invited you all here today because I'm ready to name the murderer".
-  - Hey, that's his wedding pictures.
- Must be.
I don't see a casket.
I hate that hat.
-  Our hero!
-  The plot thins!
-  Beautiful.
Found his buttonhole.
-  -  Would you look at that smile?
-  That can be cured.
- Invited a lot of empty chairs.
-  We got chairs like that back home.
-  Mm.
-  Aww.
- ## -  Thar she blows!
- I love her gown.
-  You have got a better figure.
- I love her gown.
-  You have got a better figure.
-  This is the happiest day of her life.
-   There they are.
Franklin D. Whitebread marries Miss Cynthia Soon-To-Be-Frigid.
- Don't do it, Frank!
-  You'll be sorry.
-  Say no, Frank!
-  Those flowers are pretty.
-  Her hands are full of water.
-   Oh, brother.
There's two locked up.
Got 'im!
- Oh, look!
- Even then, he didn't know how to hold a knife.
- Watch the cake die of malpractice.
- Why do I feel sorry for Frank?
Hey, what's that sticking to him?
That's the bride.
Oh, good.
Lovely.
Smarts a little, huh, Frank?
- Good shot, honey.
-  Hit him right in the mush.
- Lookit.
She can hardly wait.
-  Is that their daughter?
- That looks like you, Radar.
- Nah.
The little girl's taller.
-  Who asked you?
- Traveling light.
-  Anybody hear a siren?
- Suppose she'll take off her glasses?
Look.
Lookit.
Lookit.
- Don't blow this, Frank!
- "Oh, just shut up and get in the car, Frank".
- "I wanna drive".
- "Never mind that.
Just get in the car".
"Oh, hell".
- "Sit down and shut up".
-  I could've sworn I heard a siren.
- Vroom, vroom, vroom.
- Good-bye!
Be-dee, be-dee That's all, folks.
Be-dee, be-dee That's all, folks.
-  - Air raid!
Plane spotted!
You picked a fine time to watch a dirty movie.
This was the worst of all, Frank.
Hey, the plane's dropping something.
Holy cow!
It's Five O'Clock Charlie!
That idiot?
That's the raid?
- He couldn't hit the side of a war.
- Burns.
- "Give up, Yankee imperialist dog".
- An I.O.U. For an attack.
"Harry Truman is sleeping with your wife"?
- You know what this means, huh?
- What?
Ohh.
- Radar, call - The 44th's busy, sir, but I'll have the nurses here by breakfast.
Let's have a drink.

Trapper!

##  I can't believe the Mayo brothers started this way.
Or even the Mills Brothers.
- Try reading something.
- I read everything.
- Toss a ball.
- I've tossed everything.
Including breakfast.
There's always trolling for nurses.
I trolled all the nurses.
Let's have a blast.
- We could drown the dull in booze.
- It won't do any good.
My dull has learned how to swim.
Maybe I can get a note from my parents excusing me from the war.
Attention, all personnel.
Due to conditions beyond our control, we regret to announce that lunch is now being served.
- They got a lot of guts.
- And they keep serving them.
Do you realize this is an anniversary?
- They've given us liver or fish ten straight days in a row.
- Eleven.
- They've given us liver or fish ten straight days in a row.
- Eleven.
If they try to serve that to us one more time today - I'm gonna throw a fit.
- You won't throw a fit.
All right then, I'll throw a berserk, with a strong resemblance to a fit.
It's somethin' to do.
Gonna eat with your feet?
Only if they have corn on the cob.
- Terrific outfit, Klinger.
- Like it?
I don't usually wear floor-length during the day, but once in a while you feel like bein' dressy.
You look like my dead aunt.
Nurse Chetsberger, please contact the Red Cross representative.
Nurse Chetsberger, please contact the Red Cross representative.
How can you eat this slop?
My mouth is tone-deaf.
- Succotash, Doc?
- Yes, please.
- Potatoes?
- Fine.
- Creamed corn?
- Thank you.
- And for the entrée today - Here it comes.
Steady.
We have liver or fish.
I didn't hear you say that.
Because it isn't possible.
It's inhuman to serve the same food, day after day.
The Geneva Convention prohibits the killing of our taste buds!
- Easy.
- I simply cannot eat the same food every day!
Fish!
Liver!
Day after day!
I've eaten a river of liver and an ocean of fish!
I've eaten so much fish I'm ready to grow gills!
I've eaten so much liver, I can only make love if I'm smothered in bacon and onions!
Are we gonna stand for this?
Are we gonna let them do this to us?
"No"!
I say, "No"!
We're not gonna eat this dreck anymore!
We want something else!
We want something else!
We want something else!
We want something else!
Draftees of the world, arise!
You have noting to lose but your cookies!
We want something else!
We want something else!
Just who do you think you are, Pierce?
I broke under the pressure, warden.
Eleven straight days, Henry.
Well, don't you think I tried for some "relieviation"?
- Yes, sir.
- Radar What happened to the frozen turkey I ordered you to order?
I put in the requisition, sir, marked "urgent".
- Well?
- They sent us 5,000 athletic supporters Marked urgent!
I don't find that such a rib-tickler, Mclntyre.
- Ribs.
- All right, Radar.
Why don't you get on the horn - Trade the athletic supporters.
- And see if we can't trade those athletic supporters?
Barbecued spareribs, that's what I want!
- That's what I need!
- What you need is a tranquilizer about the size of a horse's rump!
There's a place in Chicago near the Dearborn Street station I don't know the name of it they served ribs the best in the world!
They had a barbecue sauce with it.
A flamboyant, devil-may-care yet introspective sauce.
- Spareribs?
- Ambrosia.
The gods on Olympus, when they got tired of pizza, they sent out for these ribs!
Ha!
Yum, yum.
I think he's gonna have an accident.
- Get him the barbecue ribs, Henry.
- I don't just want ribs - I want those ribs.
- Pierce, you're acting like one of my kids.
Henry, I'm all ribbed out.
I have barbecue deficiency.
Don't you get the clinical picture?
Withdrawal trauma.
Take blood, you'll see.
Half hemoglobin, half barbecue sauce from Chicago.
You're off your hinges.
Henry, they were sensational.
The ribs burned my upper lip.
I had a little cut.
I kept the scar alive for a year.
The pain was exquisite.
- What was the name of this place?
- I can't remember!
It was near the Dearborn Street station.
Well, why don't you call the station and ask?
The number's DEarborn 5-7500.
- How the hell do you know that?
- I was born in Illinois.
I spent half my life at the Dearborn station.
It was the first place my mother let me go to the men's room alone.
Come to think of it, it's where I met my wife, Lorraine.
- I gotta have those ribs.
- Sounds like you're ready to go into labor.
I'll get 'em.
Somehow.
Pierce, I don't care what you do in private.
You want ribs?
It makes me no never mind.
But as long as you're in this man's army camp, you behave yourself and you fly in formation!
- Yes, sir.
- Radar?
Let's get started on the inspection.
Yes, sir.
It was oregano in the sauce.
And just the slightest suggestion of vinegar.
And the coleslaw tasted like heather.
But those ribs, those ribs!
I'm sure they came from pigs that were virgins.
You know?
You know?
They were terrific.
Mm!
- Mm.
-  I gotta have 'em.
I gotta have 'em, Trap.
-  - Halt!
- What's the password?
- Out of my way, or I'll split your head open.
Close enough.
Radar?
Radar, it's Hawkeye.
Let me in.
I gotta use the phone.
-  - Radar!
Come on, wake up!
The war's over.
We won, 8-5.
- Radar!
Get on the phone.
- Don't shoot!
- Who's calling?
- You are.
Get out of bed or I'll take your tonsils out through your armpits.
Come on, we're calling Chicago.
DEarborn 5-7500.
- Chicago?
- "The Toddlin' Town".
Home of the stockyards.
Mrs. O'Leary's cow.
The White Sox.
The Cubs.
Carl Sandburg!
Who's he pitch for?
The poet.
"Chicago".
"Hog Butcher for the world, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat "Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler; Stormy, husky, brawling, City of the Big Shoulders"  Sandburg knew, Radar.
"Spare-ribber for the Universe!
Maker of Meat-on-a-Bone.
The home of the 'Pig-sicle'".
- "Give me your tired, your poor, your coleslaw".
- Sparky?
Yeah, it's-it's Radar.
Yeah, listen, I really I know it's late, Sparky but can you patch me through to Tokyo, Honolulu, San Francisco?
Yeah, I'm headed for Chicago.
I'll hold.
Radar, I'll let you lick my fingers for this.
- Are these ribs really that great?
- Ah.
- Better than sex.
- I don't know how good sex is.
No woman could follow them.
Especially the big ones.
The ribs, not the women.
They come in a sheet about that size!
- Wow!
- It's like making love to a xylophone.
He's got Honolulu asking for San Francisco.
Good man, that Sparky.
There may be a knighthood in this for him.
- With sparerib clusters.
- Okay, pal!
I'll take it from here!
- Thanks.
You done terrific.
- You did terrific.
That's what I said he done.
Hello Hello?
San Francisco?
Right.
Can you speak up a little louder, please?
I'm calling from Korea.
Korea!
Rhymes with "di-a".
Right.
The place that Bob Hope comes to all the time.
Listen, this is official military business.
Priority one!
Uh, can you put me through to Chicago?
Chicago!
Y-Yeah, the place with the big shoulders.
- DEarborn 5-7500.
DEarborn 5-7500.
- DEarborn 5-7500.
Right!
They're dialing.
- I love her.
- It's a he.
- I love him.
- It's ringing.
Dearborn station?
Yeah?
Hold on!
Uh, hello, this is Cranston Lamont of The Chicago Tribune.
I'm over here in Korea doing a story on our star-freckled spangled fighting boys.
- Wow!
- I'm doing a backgrounder on a Windy City boy and I need to know something: Across the street from the station, down the block there's a five-and-ten and right next to that there's a dry cleaning and dyeing place.
And right next to that, there's this place that sells ribs.
What's the name Adam's Ribs!
That's it.
Adam's Ribs.
A-D-A-M-S R-l-B-S.
- That's it.
That's it.
Mm!
- You'll smear it.
I got it engraved on my tongue.
Listen, you got a telephone book there?
Uh, all right I want you to look up the number for me!
Look, I know you're busy, mister.
Um, what is your name, please?
For the article.
Resnick?
Bernard Resnick?
Is that with an "S" or a "Z"?
Uh, thank you, Mr. Resnick.
That's a lovely name.
One of my daughters is called Resnick.
You got it?
All DEarborn 5-2750.
5-2-7-5-0.
Wait, wait, wait!
D-Don't hang up!
Get the operator for me.
Thank you, Mr. Resnick.
God bless your choo-choos.
Operator?
I want DEarborn 5-2750.
This is it, Radar.
We're approaching nirvana.
Is that near Chicago?
Hello?
What do you mean, busy?
Operator, I'm a soldier.
I'm a wounded man in Korea.
I'm trying to reach my family from a foxhole!
Hello, Adam's Ribs?
I'd like to place a takeout order, please.
All right.
Have you got a pencil?
I want twenty pounds No, make that forty pounds of your best ribs.
The jumbos.
And I want some barbecue sauce.
A gallon.
Yeah, we're having a party.
My mother's out on parole.
All right, now look.
Now don't cook 'em.
I just want them packaged.
Name of Pierce.
B.F. Pierce.
Somebody'll pick 'em up.
Good.
Okay.
Thank you.
- Couldn't have done it without you, Radar.
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh!
Damn it.
- What?
- What?
- I forgot to order the coleslaw.
Hello?
Step one: Spareribs ordered.
Check.
Step two: Ribs must be picked up.
Step three: Ribs must be paid for.
Step four: Ribs must be flown to us here in Paradise Valley.
What a picture you are of gluttony, greed, lust.
- Oral sensation.
- You're seeing the real me.
As a child, I once ate twelve banana sandwiches.
I slept in the bathroom for a week.
- Charming.
- Now, Inspector, I figure that the same person who picks the ribs up can pay for them and take them to the airport in Chicago.
- Elementary.
- This as-yet-unknown person gives them to a pilot or a stewardess, who delivers them to Military Air Transport in San Francisco.
- The rest is downhill.
- So is your head.
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus when he said the world was round.
But he went on to write a great song.
You keep this up and the squirrels are gonna bury your head somewhere.
Pilots and stewardesses love to do us favors.
I once did a stewardess a great favor.
I didn't scream while she forced herself on me.
-  There's an interesting couple.
-  Tillie and Mac.
Sir, I've got a bone I'd like to pick with you.
Wait a minute, Klinger.
First bones first.
Any luck, Radar?
Oh, I checked the personnel roster and all the patients and nobody lives in Chicago.
- What a great time to steal it.
- Rats!
- Double rats!
- Sir!
In the riot you caused by going off your noodle you got succotash on my stole!
I apologize, Klinger, from the heart of my bottom.
And liver too, you got on it!
Don't say liver!
You say that word again and I'll set your teeth on fire!
I'll have your skunk cleaned.
Right now, I'm thinking about bigger things.
- Don't you come from Chicago?
- No, he's from Toledo.
But I get my lingerie from Chicago.
And it's beautiful.
I hear.
- Do you know anybody in Chicago?
- I got an uncle there.
This could be something.
Does he like you?
Would he do you a favor?
Favor?
He'd kill for me.
He'd kill for you.
For $100, he'd kill for anybody.
Why don't you put out a contract on the spareribs?
Would your uncle handle a package for me?
- Sure, for a price.
- He doesn't have to kill the package.
Just pick it up and deliver it to the airport in Chicago.
It's done.
Won't cost you a dime.
Lady, you're a real gentleman.
All you gotta do is sign my psycho discharge papers you and Captain Mclntyre.
Klinger, that paper has to be signed by three doctors.
We're only two.
- Nobody else wants to be three.
- Okay.
The deal's off!
- Wait a second!
- No discharge, no package.
And I expect you to "un-succotash" my stole, sir!
-  So emotional.
- Meanwhile, my ribs are sitting there like barbecued orphans.
- Gee, I wish I could help.
- I wonder how you'd taste charcoaled.
- Hey!
- You know, I just remembered.
I knew a redhead in Chicago.
Oh, boy.
You talk about your ribs.
- Yeah, yeah?
- What was her name?
Mildred.
That's right.
Mildred Feeney.
- Would she do you a favor?
- She already did.
She could pick up the ribs.
She could pay for them and put them on a plane.
- I'd send her a check.
- You're hallucinating.
I haven't seen her in years.
It was a one-night stand.
No, it was a two-night.
No, I think it was three!
Radar, prepare finger.
Ready to dial.
Hello?
Yeah, Mildred Feeney?
Uh, right.
Hold on.
Go.
Hello, Mildred?
This is John Mclntyre.
That's right, "Big John".
- "Big John"?
- Lucky!
Look, honey, I know it's been a lot of years, but, uh No, I'm not actually in Chicago now.
A little bit west of there.
I'm in Korea, to be exact.
Well, I got called up into the war and uh I got to thinkin' about you.
What?
The war, Mildred.
- The war!
-  Come on, you guys, take it easy.
You're worse than the real thing.
- Lay it on her, will ya?
- What, baby?
- Me?
Married?
Married?
- Of course I'm not married, Mildred.
- Come on.
Cut it out.
- Wh-Who could follow you?
- Hey, we could lose this line.
- Lay it on her, will ya?
Uh, honey, look.
I want ya to do me a favor.
There's a package under the name of"Pierce" at a place called "Adam's Ribs" next to the Dearborn Street station.
I want you to go in there and pay for it and take it to the M.P. S at Midway Airport.
Yeah, I'll send you a check for it.
Uh, mark the package "Dr. B.F. Pierce "4077 MASH, Korea.
Rush: Medical Supplies".
What?
It's ribs and sauce.
- Yeah.
We use 'em for, uh - Anatomy practice.
Anatomy practice, right.
Well, they don't allow us to work on real people.
The sauce?
Well, uh, they don't let us use real blood, either.
You understand?
Boy, she's smart.
Thanks a lot, Mildred.
Right, honey.
Bye-bye.
-  Come on, come on.
- Mildred, I can't keep the war on hold.
I gotta go.
Bye-bye.
-  Radar.
- Yeah?
Wire the M.P. S at Midway Airport.
Tell them that the package is for Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce.
- Yeah.
- General MacArthur's personal physician.
MacArthur.
Wow.
I've never been in the stockade before.
Then wire the, uh, Military Air Transport Service, A.P.O. San Francisco.
- "A.P. O" - Tell them that it's urgent.
Critical medical supplies.
- "Critical" - "Handle with Care.
Highly Infectious".
Uh, mark it, "Quickest possible.
Do not spill.
Keep refrigerated".
Way to go, "Big John".
- Sir.
Wake up, sir.
The spareribs are here.
- Where?
Where?
They're in a supply depot down in Ouijongbu.
- Uh, they're hung up in channels.
- Who hung 'em?
Well, I talked to a Major Pfiefer.
- He wouldn't even talk to me when I talked to him.
- What'd he say?
He started with, "Drop dead".
And then he got rude!
We'll get him, even if we have to call Klinger's uncle.
- Trap?
Wake up!
-  Mildred - Me and the ribs, we're all in Korea!
- Let's eat!
Come on, Dan.
It's on the way to Seoul.
No room.
I gotta take this kid down for X ray.
Unless you want to use the rumble seats.
- Okay!
You got it!
- Gimme your hand.
Climb under.
Watch your head.
Okay, get him in.
"4077 MASH" Oh yes, talked to some cocky little nurse at your outfit.
- Radar.
- Tried to muscle me on the phone.
She's a tough little cookie.
There it is.
"One box, medical supplies.
Marked urgent".
- Figures.
- We're doctors.
We need that stuff, Major.
- It's important.
- Yeah, it's a new wonder drug.
Top shelf.
Keep those code numbers to the front, so we can read them.
Oh, sorry.
It's only our first day on the job.
- What about our package?
- You know what I've got to process?
Twelve Sherman tanks, 2,000 blankets, A trainload of semiautomatic corn poppers and baby A-bomb components.
- They're delicious with popcorn.
- Whatever it is, I've got it.
And you want me to find one insignificant little box of med supplies.
We sometimes use them in our work.
You think because you save lives, it's important.
Move this over there.
Sure.
- Another box of hernias, huh?
-  Major, you're not gonna cooperate, huh?
If I help one person, I have to help everybody.
You can't run a war on cooperation.
All right, fine.
We'll go up the line.
- Who's your boss?
- My sergeant.
- Where is he?
- Look, he's very busy, and I don't want him upset.
We're not gonna upset him.
He's over in Admin.
Sergeant Tarola.
Please don't tell him I sent you.
Thank you, Major.
You've been a tower ofJell-O.
Nobody cut requisition orders on this.
Emergency medical shipment, Sergeant.
There's no S-47/19-J accompanying.
I told you we should have got an S-47/19-J accompanying, but you wouldn't listen!
- That's necessary?
- Necessary?
We don't go to latrine around here without an S-47/19-J.
Sorry.
I wasn't gonna say anything, but this little supermarket of yours isn't all that clean.
Yeah.
Ideal breeding environment for cholera.
- The plague.
- You're kidding.
Do you always sweat in 40-degree temperature?
- I'm not sweating.
- You should be.
Nothin' wrong with me.
I feel sensational.
Ah!
There it is.
Say that again, will ya?
I feel sensational?
- Definite slurring of the "S".
- Classic early symptom.
- Followed by the eyes blinking in an up-and-down motion.
- Mm-hmm.
You know if there's plague here, we'll have to close the place.
Post it as a contagious area.
- Give you a chance to be reassigned.
- You're probably anxious to get up to the fighting war anyway, aren't you?
What's in the package?
Spareribs and sauce from Chicago.
- Adam's Ribs?
- You know?
I'm from Joliet.
I'd walk to Chicago on my knees in the snow for a takeout order.
He's one of you.
- How many you got?
- Forty pounds.
I'll take twenty and a quart of sauce.
Ten, and a pint of sauce.
Twelve, and a pint and a half.
And coleslaw.
We didn't order any coleslaw.
You sent all the way to Chicago, and no coleslaw?
Forgive us, we're draftees.
## Shall we give thanks?
Praise the Lord and pass the sauce.
Attention all personnel.
Attention.
Ambulances in the lower compound.
Choppers on the upper pad.
-  - Incoming wounded.
Repeat, incoming wounded.
All O.R. Personnel report on the double.
- Come on!
-  No!
No, that's not fair!
- Come on.
- No, no, wait!
It's not fair!
We got ribs now!
Adam's Ribs from Chicago!
We lied to Mildred!
I had to send her a check!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Dear Dad.
Something new has been added: A tape recorder.
One of our guys stole it from the Tokyo PX.
He gave it to a nurse as a carnal bribe and then she gave it to Father Mulcahy in a gin-induced fit of remorse.
Father Mulcahy gave it to me because he didn't want anybody to think he was taping confessions.
Our program originates from the Swamp.
Which is the subject of a picture spread in next month's Toilet and Garden.
Not five feet away from me, I see TrapperJohn Mclntyre cutting his toenails.
He sells them to the tourists as war souvenirs.
Say hello, Trapper.
Hello, Trapper.
Isn't he clever?
He had the bolt in his neck tightened yesterday.
Speaking of which yesterday, that is we had what is known around the 4-0-double-7 as a full, rich day.
It started out in triage.
That's the process of assigning the wounded medical priority who's hurt the worst, who's sicker than who.
- On the subject of sick, Frank Burns was in charge.
- Move, move, move.
I share quarters with Frank - Frank and a family of roaches and a herd of silverfish.
- Driver!
- Frank is the tall one.
- Where's the driver?
I want the driver of this bus, chop-chop.
- What do you want the driver for?
- I want to know what we got on this bus!
Migrant workers, Frank.
They came to pick the lettuce crop.
Give this man a unit of whole blood.
He didn't make the ride.
I can't find a tag.
This must be the Luxembourg lieutenant.
- Are you the driver of this bus?
- Yes, sir.
I've ordered you not to wear dresses.
Oh, not till I get a psycho discharge, sir.
- Over my dead body.
- Whatever you say, sir.
Where's your S-47 manifest and D-21 triplicate?
You should have given those to me immediately.
Sir, these men are hurt and bleeding.
Did you give them permission to bleed?
Did they fill in their pain forms?
Oh, stuff it, you wagster!
- What about him?
- Leave him.
He can wait.
Pierce and Mclntyre report to O.R. Immediately.
Move it, sirs.
All yours, Frank.
Not too many decisions, now.
You don't want to get a headache.
What have you got there?
- I said, what have you got there?
- A sandwich case, Major.
- You want him back-up or belly-up?
-   Turkish soldier, sir.
I'm pretty nuts but this guy could open a crazy school.
- Why wasn't this man sedated?
- He was, sir.
They pumped a whole drugstore into his arm.
He's got a busted shoulder and a fanny full of lead but these Turks won't leave their buddies for nothing.
-  - Right.
You want to take away that knife of his?
I'm not interested in mock heroism.
I'll settle for the real thing, sir.
Get him to pre-op!
They'll sedate him!
Klinger, I want to see you out of that dress tonight!
Never on a first date, sir.
Don't sneak down on me like that.
- I'm sorry, Major.
- What happened to saluting, Corporal?
Beats me, sir.
Have you seen the Luxembourg lieutenant?
Mclntyre says he's supposed to be on this bus, but I can't find anybody I don't care what Captain Mclntyre said.
I have never cared.
And at this moment, I don't care twice as much as I never cared before!
Hey!
Excuse me.
I need some help.
I believe a salute is in order, Lieutenant.
- Uh, here's a salute for you, sir.
- What's your outfit, buddy?
I'd appreciate some help right now.
I asked your outfit.
My sergeant, Sergeant Bryan, is in the back of the jeep.
He's badly hurt.
I want you to take care of him immediately.
Look, Lieutenant, I know how difficult this war is.
It probably seems even worse to you people at the front.
Your Sergeant Bryan will be processed and taken care of in due course.
Now.
Sir that's one of those new guns, can shoot 30 corporals a second.
I make the medical decisions around here, Lieutenant.
Decide.
Are you threatening me with that thing?
Yes, sir.
- Corporal?
You're a witness.
- Sir?
I sure wish I could go and report it, sir.
Just stay right here and keep an eye on this man.
I think Colonel Blake will have a little something to say about all this.
Hi.
Where does that door go?
That's the pre-op p-preparation before operating.
All right.
Get another man and take Sergeant Bryan in there.
Only surgical personnel can go in there, sir.
- Do it.
- That's a great idea.
Why don't I just get a man and do just like you wanted me to?
You have no idea, Dad, what a calming effect Frank Burns has in pre-op.
Not unlike Dracula showing up at a blood bank.
Fortunately, we can, in times of stress always rely on Henry Blake's cool eloquence.
Will you hold your bladder, Frank?
I tell you, he threatened me with a gun!
It probably had no water in it, Frank.
- Is this the crazy Turk?
- Yeah.
I gave him half a grain of morphine, sir.
Never mind about the crazy Turk.
There's a crazy American out there.
Sorry, Frank.
This is the crazy Turk hospital.
The crazy American hospital's on the other side of town.
Get him on the table.
You just didn't read the guy right or something, Frank.
I mean, nobody walks in and sticks up a MASH unit at gunpoint.
- Bring him in.
- Colonel - Who's the head man here?
- Um, he is.
You rank this chicken lover?
Well, I'm the I'm the senior officer.
Sir, my name is Smith.
This is Sergeant Bryan.
He's one of the finest men alive, and we're going to keep him alive, right?
And he's gonna get top priority, right?
Now, look here, Lieutenant, uh - Smith.
- That's right.
First thing you're gonna do, Smith, is put that gun down.
Guns have a way of going off, which is usually followed by parts of the body breaking away.
Why don't Lieutenant Smith and I have a talk outside?
- Okay.
- Oh, no.
Not till someone Meanwhile, your friend will be looked at by Colonel Blake and Major Chicken Lover.
Let's go, shall we?
You're just spreading germs in here.
Is that the guy, Frank?
Uh-huh.
- You smoke?
- No.
Oh, good for you.
The country's littered with butts as it is.
Turning South Korea into an ashtray.
- They call you Smitty?
- Some.
They call me Hawkeye.
That's from The Last of the Mohicans the only book my father ever read.
Mother read all the time.
That way she didn't have to talk to Father.
Uh, look, Smitty.
I'm gonna have to go serious on you about this thing, okay?
Yes, sir.
We have a different perspective on war as a whole than I think is possible for you.
To a line officer with 30 or 40 guys' lives depending on them and with your life depending on them the war's not some big geopolitical conflict between nations and ideologies.
It's not just China and America sticking their tongues out at each other.
To you, there's maybe 30 or 40 guys in that high grass over there trying to kill me and my 30 or 40 guys.
- It's that concentrated.
To you, that's the entire war.
- I guess that's right.
But it's something else in our little heaven.
To us, the war is trying very hard to control chaos.
We're up to our bottoms in other people's bottoms here.
We can't afford the same kind of fierce personal loyalties that you and Sergeant Bryan feel for each other.
Can you understand that?
I sure can.
It's the size of the wound, who's bleeding the most buckets that we give priority to.
It's the only place I know where being the worst makes you the best.
Yeah.
I sure can see what you mean.
I thought you would.
Now, get back in there and fix Sergeant Bryan or else, understand?
Perfectly.
- Number ten blade.
- Number ten.
Aah!
Frank!
I don't mind you trying to make a soup bone out of my thumb but if we screw up on Sergeant Bryan here, the fella who's outside paying the bills might get very angry.
We wouldn't want his credit card to go off.
Giving in to that lieutenant is the height of cowardice.
Coming from you, that's a compliment.
Keep quiet, or we won't let you keep the deposit on the specimen bottles.
Let me see those X rays again, Mr. Kwang.
How's the mad Turk doing, Henry?
I could sell his left shoulder as a jigsaw puzzle.
Colonel!
- Frank, will you just - Henry, your patient!
Oh, for Pete's sake.
All right, you.
On your back.
Attaboy.
Bomb him, will you, Mr. Kwang?
What the hell is he saying?
- Why don't we all go to Berlitz and find out?
- He's your patient!
Get him!
Now, look, look.
I mean, nobody wants to hurt you, guy.
Keep it up, Henry.
Lovely, Henry.
Just give me the needle, huh?
Just give me the -  -  Guard!
Mayday!
- Mayday!
- 99, 98 Good night, sweet prince.
Are you feeling better, sir?
I dreamt I was home.
Sunday morning.
Lorraine and me in bed.
All of us: The kids, the dog the Sunday papers.
You can never put that dog next to any papers.
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Where's the Turk, Radar?
Did we get him?
Oh, not yet, sir.
We're combing the entire area.
Fool could have killed me.
I get the wrong kind of shot, I turn blue and curl up in a ball.
There's someone waiting to see you, sir.
I was born with someone waiting to see me.
Right in here, sir.
Lt.
Colonel Blake, I am Colonel Blanche commander of the Luxembourg contingent to the U.N. Forces in Korea.
Well, this is a privilege.
I've met many of our allies over here, sir but you're the first, um, um Luxembourger.
One of my men, Lt.
Henri Batiste LeClerq he was wounded and brought to your unit today.
Well, I'm sure he's getting the very best care we can give him, Colonel.
- Uh, sir?
- Hmm?
- That won't be necessary.
- Of course it's necessary.
- What are you talking about?
- Lieutenant LeClerq sort of, um died, sir.
Oh?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Those are the fortunes of war.
Are you dead sure, Radar?
I mean Well, we think that he more or less had passed on when he was brought in on the bus.
You will understand, Colonel Blake that it is of the utmost importance to our small nation that I recover the body for appropriate military honors.
Yes, sir.
We'll have that body for you before you can say "Jacques Robinson".
Radar?
Well Now, sir, the thing is that we've sort of, um misplaced him, sir lost him, you might say.
We've lost him?
And that, sir, is not at all one of the fortunes of war.
I will not leave here without him.
- I want this camp turned upside-down.
- I'll have the place turned upside-down.
- I'll find him; I promise.
- There'll be no not finding him.
Clear?
He'll find him.
We lose 'em all the time.
You still there, Dad?
I am, most unfortunately, still here.
I wrote a letter to General MacArthur last week suggesting the war be declared a draw.
He sent me back an autographed picture of himself wading ashore at the Philippines.
Right now, my manservant Trapper is mixing me a martini.
He makes them beautifully.
He made me an especially dry one last night, but it blew away.
Your recipe is four to one, is it not?
Five to one, actually.
Uh, five parts gin and one moment's silence for the vermouth.
Thank you.
I'm sure our listeners found that boring without actually being interesting at all.
- No trouble.
- Getting back to yesterday, Dad Trapper and Frank Burns worked on Sergeant Bryan with a devotion unmatched since Dr. Mudd worked onJohn Wilkes Booth.
- Clamp, clamp, clamp.
- How's he doing?
Okay?
Okay.
Clamp.
Lt.
Smith sat in on the session with his E-flat alto carbine.
At one point, Corporal O'Reilly came scurrying along on his two little feet, which incidentally is also his height.
Sir!
Sir?
- I found him!
- Found who, Radar?
Mr. Right?
Who?
The Turkish soldier!
I need help!
- Ask Colonel Blake.
- He keeps, uh, falling asleep.
- How can you tell?
- I'll get your bag.
- Where is the Turk, Radar?
- He's hiding in the kitchen.
If he eats any of our food, our problems may be over.
Uh, hello?
Now, look, fella.
I realize that to you, the war's not just some geopolitical conflict of nations and ideologies.
-  -  That's twice that didn't work.
I don't think he speaks any English.
If he understands fear, we're in business.
The U.N. Puts out this Turkish dictionary.
Well, they're certainly gonna get my Christmas card business.
- Look up, uh - Cinli!
Cinli that's good.
Look that up.
Look under-under "ch" for Cinli.
Cinli!
Hurry up, Radar, before his eyeballs explode.
- Chinese!
It means Chinese!
- Chinese!
-  - He certainly doesn't seem too crazy about you-know-whats.
- Yeah.
- I got an idea.
Whatever it is, I love it.
Momentito.
- Cinli!
- Cinli!
-  -  I think he just wants to get back to his outfit so he can kill more Chinese.
Chinese!
Cinli!
And that's just what we're gonna let him do.
- But his shoulder He needs attention!
- Don't argue, Radar!
-  -  He needs clothes.
- Right.
- Give him yours.
- Huh?
- Get undressed, Radar, fast or I'll pull you right out of your boots!
I send you back to front.
- In a jeep.
- Jeep?
So you can all the Cinli you want to your Turkish delight.
Okay?
- Okay.
-  Good Joe.
Damn good Joe.
Get undressed, Radar.
I'm sorry there's no band.
Come on, Lieutenant.
I can't see anything.
-  Lap sponge.
-  Lap Sponge.
- Rats!
- Watch it, Frank.
-  What did he do?
- Nothing!
Mm!
Don't sweat, Lieutenant.
That's what he usually does around here.
No slipups, understand?
Hey, look, pal.
It's hard enough playing cat's cradle with someone's guts.
You don't make it any easier standing there with that coffee grinder.
- This isn't the Old West, you know.
- Just keep working.
Boy, you guys at the front You think you own the war.
Well, it's not easy back here, you know the noise, the pressure.
I'd like to see how tough you'd be if you didn't have to be so brave.
Hey, Frank, you're sucking around for a blast of friendly gunfire.
Frank, let's get ready to close.
I'll clean him up.
- Okay.
- Can we have a little irrigation?
You sirs seen a body in here should be somewhere else?
Yeah, Klinger: Mine.
- Suture.
- Suture.
Boy, if this doesn't take the cake.
Sending a wounded man back to the front in my clothes and toasting it with prune juice.
Radar, in my bag, right on top is a brown bottle with clear liquid.
Nice, clear liquid.
Put some in our friend here's juice.
And you jeep him out of camp, but you won't get more than half a mile - before he falls asleep, and bang-o.
- Bang-o!
Right.
And you drive him right back here and we put him in the shop for some body work.
Ready, Skippy?
- Here's to chloryl hydrate.
- Chloryl hydrate.
Okay?
You bet your mustache.
- Frank, would you do me a favor?
- Sure.
Next time we work together, let's do it apart.
- Love your toga, Radar.
- Just nobody say nothing to me.
Corner of 57 th Street and the war, and step on it.
I've had this place turned upside-out.
I can't understand it.
- Did you see that?
- Just my corporal riding around in a sheet, sir.
There's so little for the men to do.
- That was my jeep.
He has stolen it.
- Oh, I don't think so.
It's not like Radar to steal anything without asking.
Colonel, I'll get the jeep back.
Don't worry.
But as for Lt.
LeClerq, since we can't seem to locate him maybe we could perform a brief ceremony honoring his loss.
That is, your losing him, not our losing him.
That is very thoughtful.
Well, I think it's the very "lost" we can do.
Hey, look, pal, It's been a well-rounded day of insanity to which your contribution is no longer welcome.
So you can knock off the heroics and drop the fowling piece.
And I'd lay off watching those movies where the hero always says "Hey, take my buddy first.
He's hurt worse than me, Doc".
Right?
Wrong.
It's his chest and shoulder.
Recruiting office got their money's worth out of this guy.
- Let's prep him.
- And you can remove my foot from my mouth.
It's about a size 12-ectomy.
Corpsman!
Three-oh silk on a Keith needle.
Attention.
All available personnel will assemble in the compound for a memorial tribute personally conducted by Colonel Henry Blake.
Finish closing, my dear.
We'll split the fee.
Lost but not least I mean, uh, last but not lost, the Oh, boy.
This command salutes the gallant spirit if not the actual body of Lt.
Henry Batiste LeClerq.
Tony, hit it.
##  The national anthem of Luxembourg.
## ## LeClerq!
## I thought you said he was dead.
He got better.
He never could handle his prune juice.
- Dennis, Igor, give me a hand.
-  - Okay?
- No okay.
You hold it just one second.
You're gonna stay here.
I got to fix you up.
I fix you.
- You sick.
You got that?
- Damn good Joe.
Okay?
- Hey, wait!
- Where are you going?
- Hey!
- Hey!
Yeah, well, that's how it is: You lose a few and you lose a few.
- ## - This is almost all run out, Dad, so before it's over, I thought you might like to hear from some of the guys here.
Trapper, want to say hello to my dad?
Hello, Dad.
Your son's no good.
Thank you, Trapper.
This is my other bunkie, Dad: Frank Burns.
Oh, I know.
And then that thing squirts water in my face.
That's Frank Burns, Dad, all over.
-  - Radar?
Would you like to, uh, snore something for my father?
Thank you, Radar O'Reilly.
And the ever-lovely Henry Blake.
Um, Mr. Pierce, sir I'd be mighty grateful if you'd call my wife, Lorraine Blake in Bloomington, Illinois.
- Thank you, Henry.
- And ask her to send some new shorts.
Okay.
Well, it's, uh It's just about all over, Dad.
Good-bye,  And, uh hope I see you soon.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
## Here you go.
Just like Mom's, give or take a couple of nozzles.
I'm sorry it's powdered.
World War II surplus.
Just think about the guys in the next war that are gonna have to eat this one.
## Radar, your little friend and I just had another shower together.
I think he's trying to have an affair with one of my corns.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
That's quite a spread you got here for the little buggers.
Oh, they'd do the same for me if they had the wood.
They all got their own little dog tags.
That, uh, "P" for "Protestant"?
- "Possum," sir.
I put 'em according to family.
- I see.
I told you not to do that.
He's a colonel.
Gee!
You make a great lower-lip sandwich.
Really?
Mmm - I'm engaged to a pilot.
- So am I. I just hope it's not the same one.
-  Anybody in here?
-  - Wait.
- Later, Doctor.
My tent, around seven-ish?
I'll be the one with the khaki rose in my teeth.
Now, what can I do for you, Radar?
And please remember, I'm running out of anti-puberty pills.
Uh, you're supposed to sign these release papers for these patients' "releasal".
I don't understand a word you say but I'll fight to the death your right to confuse me.
- Sign right here.
- Hey, that's a nasty scratch.
Whoever she is, you better tell her to clip her nails or file her teeth or both.
No, I was kiddin' around with a dog the other day and it bit me.
- Didn't mean to though.
- What dog?
When?
Couple of days ago.
Just a mutt.
I give it stuff from the kitchen although I don't like bein' cruel to animals.
- Where's this dog now?
- Comes and goes.
Radar, dysentery and rabies are the two biggest numbers on the Korean hit parade.
Get me that dog.
"Corporal Travis, Richard.
"Corporal Travis, Richard.
To Tokyo.
Typical psycho case, shell shock".
Frank, that's straight out of World War I. - Nobody thinks "shell shock" anymore.
- Oh, what's the diff?
Too much action gets 'em in the old brain box.
Makes even the best soldier gaga.
Frank, I defy you to show me a medical book that lists the word "gaga".
- New shipment?
- Yeah.
They were stampeded by a herd of tanks.
One kid's paralyzed, but no apparent injury.
Which is why I'm sending him to Tokyo.
Frank, it's no skin off your nose if we observe him for a few hours.
We haven't facilities for every slug-nutty that comes through here.
- Slug-nutty?
- Wait a second.
Wait a minute.
Look, Frank, we can settle this diplomatically.
Shake hands, go to your corner and when the bell rings, Trapper will come over and beat your brains out.
Slug-nutty -  Here?
-  Right here, yeah.
-  How do you feel, fella?
- I don't, sir.
What happened?
Can you talk about it?
I don't know.
What's the last thing you remember?
Uh the tanks, I guess.
And I blacked out.
And the next thing I know, I couldn't move.
Sounds like one of those cases Sid Freedman's been working on.
- All right, you can park him.
He's staying.
- Yes, sir.
I'm in charge, and I say he's not staying.
He's not wounded.
And probably just another litter salesman trying to suck us in with a free demonstration.
He goes to Tokyo, and that's an order.
Cancel the order.
We'll take the patient.
I outrank them, corpsman.
I can have you punished.
We can do better than that.
We'll stitch your helmet to your head.
-  This way.
- You two are gonna pay for this.
- Not on our salary.
- We'd like to apologize for Major Ferret Face.
He used to be a driver for Hitler till the bomb went off.
Been losing screws and clickin' his heels ever since.
Sidney?
Hawkeye Pierce.
Did I interrupt you in the middle of someone?
Good.
Listen, we got a kid up here who's paralyzed but he's sustained no wounds at all.
Yeah.
Combat exhaustion, I figured.
Listen, I'd love for you to come up here and try your new therapy on him.
Well, I've been trying to do it in my own crude way, but Look, I I know you're busy.
I'm busy too.
We're all busy.
The war is making us all millionaires.
I can't do it.
I'm not a psychiatrist.
I'm not screwed up enough.
Okay, I'll try.
I'll try.
- What did Sidney say?
- He said I should go ahead and do it.
I'll be "wonderful".
- Watch this kind of wonderful.
- Captain Pierce, I want a word with you.
- Fine.
You want to act it out or whisper it in my ear?
- It's about Corporal Travis.
Because of your orders, we're having to change his bed around the clock.
Well, you have my permission to move the clock.
- You're disrupting my nurses' routine.
- Look, Clara I'm not issuing a bedpan license to anybody who can walk on his own two feet, okay?
That is the most inhumane, degrading thing I've ever heard of.
- How can you be so cruel?
- Tight shorts.
Cuts off the oxygen supply to my brain.
Morning, Corporal.
You're still a U.S. Soldier!
I expect you to look at me when I address you!
Lot of people here at Cockroach General think that you can't do anything for yourself, like, like walk or anything.
I don't think that's true.
What do you think?
I think you're wrong.
Yeah, but your legs are on my side.
What's that mean?
They're both still there, each on the correct side.
You haven't got a scratch inside or out.
They can function.
You wanna tell me about the tanks?
What happened after the tanks came?
Look, we all have our breaking point.
Personally, mine is at 2:00, It's a condition known in medical terms as "yellow belly".
I survive by keeping a standing reservation at the latrine and screaming into my pillow every night.
Of course, that's not everybody's style.
Okay, you'll tell me when you're ready.
Meanwhile, muscles have a way of being very vindictive.
You don't take 'em out for a walk once in a while, they try to stay home permanently.
In fact, you lie there long enough, when you go home you're gonna get yourself a good job as a doorstop!
Save the room service.
He's takin' the shoe leather express to the mess tent.
- He can't eat in there.
- Who can?
I hear the specialty today is "trench" toast.
Doctor, the patient obviously can't walk.
Well, then he can crawl, or he can go hungry!
Whatever you prefer!
Sir, don't you think I want to move?
Well, it'll come in handy when you get sent back to the front.
Otherwise, you're gonna be a pretty big papoose for somebody's backpack!
Not easy, is it?
Do you know that Hitler and I have the same answering service?
-  -  Here, doggie, doggie.
Poor little doggie, all alone in a foreign country, lost.
- That dog is Korean, Radar.
It barks in Korean.
- Oh.
-  -  - You You You wanna quit, sir?
-  No, no.
But if I shake hands with one more farmer, I'll probably be elected to office.
- Aw, I'm sorry, sir.
It's all my fault.
- It's all my fault.
It wouldn't have happened if I never let you have that zoo.
I should've seen it comin' first time you came in with that little field mouse and asked us to fit him for glasses.
Here, doggie.
- How's your hand?
- It's okay.
-  Oh, hello, Mrs. Rosie.
-  Hi, Rosie.
Hello, Colonel Blake.
Radar.
What do ya hear, Rosie?
Well, the Philippines just arrived with 50,000 cakes of soap - Janet Leigh's marrying Tony Curtis -  And it looks like Ike's got this nomination all sewn up.
Boy, you really have all the poop, don't you?
Yeah, uh, speaking of poop, you haven't seen a little dog around here, have you, Miss Rosie?
- A little white and brown one?
- Uh, no, sir, it was more brown than white, actually - It's just a basic dog about so high with a little wet nose.
- He was brown.
- It bit Radar on the hand.
- Are you all right, Corporal?
Uh, yes, ma'am, as long as I don't start acting rabid.
- You haven't seen him, huh?
- I don't think so.
- Oh, they've seen your dog, Colonel.
- Oh, where?
When?
Ask him.
- Uh, what'd he say?
What'd he say?
- "K-Kay Kay koom moouh".
- "Kay koom moouh.
Kay koom" - They say, "It was delicious".
Holy Toledo.
"Dog stew".
Radar, these guys took your dog home in a people bag.
I'm sorry, Corporal.
How could they do that, eat a dog?
Must have been a hell of a bun.
It's a very common dish among our older people.
Did this dog have anything around its neck like, uh, tags?
- They ate the tags too?
- They say their dinner wasn't wearing that.
- Oh!
Then it's not my one then, sir.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, great.
Wonderful.
- Sir, wonderful - Wait a minute.
We're still not out of the woods, Radar.
- What do you mean?
I mean, as long as that mutt's still missing, you're gonna have to start the rabies shots.
- The shots - Look, I'll be right there with ya.
And I come visit you.
I'll bring you something special to eat.
Oh, no, thanks, Mrs. Rosie.
I'm not feeling very hungry in the future.
It's just fever from the vaccine, Corporal.
Yes, ma'am.
Aren't you gonna read your letter?
Oh, I get sort of carsick when I read in bed.
Would you, for me?
Well, it's from a young lady.
It might be intimate or personal.
Oh, that's okay.
I don't know anybody personally.
Well, all right, but rest assured, I won't listen to a word I read.
"Dear Corporal O'Reilly, you don't know me, but Mrs. Kittley "whose cashier where I work and also a Red Cross lady "gave me your name off a list as a young red-blooded American soldier "I could make happy with a letter from home.
"So I did.
I know you are busy with the war "laying down your life, etcetera, so may not have time to write back.
"If so, please check one Yes, I can answer this; No, I cannot.
"And now a little bit about myself.
"I am 17 years old and my name is Wanda Nell McCandless.
"I live in Catoosa, Oklahoma "and work in candy at Kress's Five and Dime.
"That's probably why everyone tells me I'm sweet.
Ha ha.
"How do you like me so far: Yes/no?
"My favorite song is 'Oh, the Wayward Wind is a Restless' by Gogi Grant "and 'Pretty Thing,' 'Diddy Wah Diddy' by Bo Diddley.
Do you agree: Yes/no"?
- Which one?
-  The The second one.
The "Diddy Bo Diddy" thing?
"By writing this letter, I feel I'm doing my own small part for my country.
Would you like to go steady?
If so, would we have to go all the way"?
Oh, no.
Especially on the first letter.
"Because I'm not allowed to do that for my country, although there are some do.
Do you know Sharon Kay LaFever: Yes/no"?
No.
"If so, she's one that does.
"Hope you don't get killed in action before this gets there.
"Please send me a picture of you in your uniform and I'll send you one of me in mine.
"S-W-A-K, Wanda Nell.
"P.S. If asked, people say I am a very pleasant-looking young lady.
"How would you describe yourself?
"Check one: Made in heaven, adorable, not bad need help, really hurting".
Corporal?
V-A-l-L-N-E-S-S.
There it is, Scrabble fans, and that's the end of the game.
"Vailness"?
"Vailness".
What the devil does "vailness" mean?
It means he's losing.
Take that off.
- I swear it's a word.
I swear it on Frank's life.
- "Vailness"?
"Vailness".
A quality of"vail".
The act of"vailing".
To be full of"vaily".
Aw, come on.
Henry, it's your turn.
I quit.
What am I gonna do with an "X" and a "zikm"?
Somebody plays a "ray," you can take your "X" and blow this game wide open.
Okay, okay.
What I need is another drink.
What's the matter with the one you got?
Oh.
For one thing, it's gone.
Poor little tyke, his first shot.
Pretty rough, you know.
All alone in the hospital.
Henry, he is with other patients.
Who would find it very strange to see their doctor crawling into bed with one of them.
Yeah, but why Radar?
Such a good kid.
Tell you what.
After lights out, we'll go over there and we'll entertain him - with little bunny shadows on the wall.
-  - I'm closed.
- Colonel, I know you're in there.
That's very good, Frank.
Now can you describe what he's wearing?
- Colonel - Frank, whatever it is just write it down and put it on my desk where I can't find it.
I just tripped over Captain Pierce's patient.
- He was crawling into the mess tent.
- Terrific.
Is this the battle fatigue case?
- Uh-huh.
- It's disgraceful.
A United States soldier crawling on the ground.
Try telling that to the infantry, Frank.
That man's a psycho, and for some perverted reason these two want to play games with him.
- We're just following Sid Freedman's advice.
- Sid's the best.
You get a soldier who has hysterical paralysis and you treat him as though he's really paralyzed, and he'll become sick just to rationalize the guilt of leaving his buddies at the front.
Anyone who needs psychiatry is sick in the head.
Aw, can it, Frank.
Go ahead.
Sid feels you take a patient like that and send him back to a nice, clean hospital, it just deepens the guilt.
You send him home and it sets it in concrete.
Yeah.
He's been treating his patients as close to the front as possible with the idea that they'll return to their unit.
Otherwise, they get sent stateside, and and one moment's failure on the battlefield becomes a lifetime disability.
- Sid gotten good results?
- Good enough to keep trying.
It's a bunch o' hooey, Colonel.
I'm taking this to a higher authority.
Aw, Frank, you're not gonna call your mother again?
You know, it seems to me the fact that he made it to the mess tent at all is a good sign.
- Oh, very good.
- Yeah.
Now if we could just get him to open up - Oh, very good.
- Yeah.
Now if we could just get him to open up about what happened, talk it all out.
Unfortunately, in his eyes, I'm just left of Godzilla.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Why don't I give it a try?
My wife says I'm easy to talk to whenever we're talkin'.
I hear, you and I have something in common.
You're from Boston.
That's where I interned when I wasn't tryin' to sneak into the ballpark.
You ever watch the Red Sox at Fenway?
I grew up at Fenway.
Radar?
Can you hear me?
It's me.
I'm sorry about the car, Dad.
I had to swerve to miss the lake.
We really miss you around the place.
-  - Radar?
Are you sure your parents won't be home till later?
Ted Williams drafted?
- You sure?
- He's on his way to the R.O.K. Oh, they can't do that.
The Sox'll never take the pennant without him.
and an average of.
318.
- Radar?
- Hmm?
I really hate to bother you with this but could you just think for a second where the key to the bottom of my liquor cabinet might be?
Mm-hmm.
- Well, where is it?
- Um Oh, it's under the welcome mat on the back porch.
Radar, we don't have a back porch.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I'll request one for you right away.
Doesn't seem fair.
He was having such a great year.
Weren't you, before you were drafted?
Yeah but I bet he'll do a lot better over here.
Better than who?
Those tanks, they just kept coming and coming and they were so big.
They were so big, you know?
And they killed everyone.
And And they killed 'em even after they were dead.
I I tried.
I really tried but I couldn't move.
I didn't fire my rifle I didn't throw my grenade God, I didn't do anything.
I just laid there like some coward -  - It's all right, Corporal.
- It's all right.
-   Okay, there's no rabies in this group.
Now, so that none of us ever have to go through this again -  - I'm gonna vaccinate all your little hoo-has.
Steal the sign from the nurses' tent?
Mclntyre stand still and pretend you're not here.
I do that all day long.
I think Radar's dog came home to roost.
Just gonna ease over nice and friendly - and grab him!
- Come on, let's go!
- Hey!
Doggie!
- Come on, dog!
-  -  -  Look out!
Mad dog!
Look out!
-  - Look out.
- Watch it.
- Where's he going?
- He's going behind the mess tent.
- He's going behind the mess tent.
- Look out!
-  -  Oh, my goodness.
-  - Look out!
- Mad dog!
Look out!
-  - Radar.
- Huh?
- We found the dog and it's negative.
You're gonna be okay.
- Oh!
- No more shots?
- Not on your Aunt Fanny.
- Then I'm gonna live past 18.
-  A deal's a deal, sir: No more "hells," "damns" and especially not the big one no more fibs, and I promise I won't watch my rabbits mess around anymore.
So whatever Major Houlihan says is what I feel.
Anything I could add would be of little consequence.
- I won't argue with you there, Frank.
- You rang, Henry?
It's very simple, Colonel.
Either you ship Travis out or the major and I will simply have to go over your head.
Well, you've done that so many times, I've got athlete's scalp.
- How's the Travis kid coming?
- I think okay.
Give him a few more days.
Keeping that man here defies every medical precept.
So do you, Frank.
You're an incredible example of death after life.
- Colonel, did you hear that?
- Yeah, I heard that   Uh, Captain Pierce, sir?
I'm standing.
Great position.
He had no idea you were so tall.
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been rough on you.
I'm not usually a pushover for a uniform, but I love ya, kid, I really do.
- Margaret, I was wrong.
- Oh.
You're always wrong, Frank.
That's what's so right about you.
Come on.
I'll buy some bad coffee.
- Travis, this time you walk to the mess tent.
- Hey.
- Where's my Sunbather's Annual?
- I don't know.
- What are you reading?
- Ladies'HomeJournal.
I'm taking a test to see if I'm a thoughtful wife.
- What's that, Frank?
- Medical journal.
You know, the Travis case reminded me of the importance of keeping up-to-date medically.
- Oh, very good, Frank.
- Yeah.
For instance this article, it suggests that on major surgery a doctor should base his fee on Hey, stop that!
Come on, you guys!
Hey!
Help!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
- Corporal.
- Sir?
- Where are you going with all those vegetables?
- Uh, nowhere, Major.
- I was just fixing myself a little salad.
- A little salad?
You could hide in there till the war was over, and nobody'd find you.
My doctor back home says I have to eat lots of greens.
I have a, uh, deficiency of malnutrition.
What kind of a jackass do you think I am?
Oh, you'd know that better than me, sir.
Corporal, if those vegetables are for you you sit down there and eat 'em right now, every bit of'em.
Now, sir?
Uh Well, I was gonna eat 'em at the movies tonight.
Who eats salad at the movies?
- I'm a vegetarian, sir.
I won't touch popcorn.
- Oh.
Hi.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Major Burns stopped me.
Oh, gee.
He's rough.
I thought he just hated people, but he hates us too.
- Hi.
Here you go.
-  Here you go.
You're eating just as good as we do now.
I sure am sorry about that.
Hey.
What's up?
Come here.
I want to see you.
Come on.
Come on.
Oh, there we go.
It's just the war.
If you were an American animal, you'd be miles away from here.
Maybe not, though.
I'm here, and I'm an American animal.
Attention, all personnel.
Incoming wounded.
Both surgical shifts report to the operating room.
Both shifts, please.
- We just came off a shift.
- I feel like an embalmer's practice dummy.
You know how easily I could live without any more wounded?
- It's called peace.
- Well, we certainly can't have any more of that.
Dear Dad: The wounded keep coming and coming.
The latest batch were Greek soldiers.
Greece is one of the 17 U.N. Countries fighting here in Korea.
Greeks, Siamese, Ethiopians, Turks.
You name 'em, we got 'em.
The common denominator is blood, and it's all red.
And there's an awful lot of it leaking out around here.
-  - Okay, cut that.
We spent the better part of a day mending the heirs to Plato, Plutarch, Aristotle, Socrates.
I know a Greek back home.
Owns an ice cream parlor.
Right next door to the Confucius Hand Laundry, Frank?
What's that supposed to mean?
- Want to learn about medicine, Mr. Kwang?
- Mm-hmm.
All came from Greece.
Started with a man named Hippocrates, born in 460.
Right next door to 461.
He, uh, wrote treatises on medicine handed down concepts that are in use today.
He also composed the Hippocratic Oath.
Very good, Frank.
Go to the head of your patient.
I'll finish here.
Put him back on the wooden horse.
- Marlow, you want to give us a hand here?
- Suction.
Okay.
Ours is a noble and ancient profession, Mr. Kwang.
- Homer wrote about doctors carrying out operations in The Iliad.
- Right.
Of course, they didn't make temple calls.
Who was it who wrote, "A physician alone is worth many men"?
- I wrote that, Frank.
- Tsk.
Actually, my receptionist said it once during a tandem exploratory.
Hey, somebody put me or this patient back to sleep!
Come on, honey!
Move!
What have we here?
Is my leg bad, Doc?
- I've seen worse.
- Will it have to come off?
I don't know how to do that.
We'll have to keep it on.
You'll be fine.
Take five.
Okay, let's prep him.
Come on.
- Radar - Sir?
I will never understand how you can hear me before I ever call you.
I guess it's the same as cows lying down on all fours just before it rains.
- Do cows lay down on all fours before it rains?
- Yes, sir.
I wonder why.
I don't think they want to get their bags wet.
- Sure know a lot about animals, Radar.
- I got 16 cats back home, sir.
Oh.
At the draft board they found a fur ball in my throat.
- Thanks for the pencil, Radar.
- You're welcome, sir.
Oh, sir, there's a Colonel Andropolis to see you.
Well, do we know any Andropolises?
Andropoli?
- He's with the Greek army.
- Has he got a problem?
Does he look like trouble?
- Uh, no, sir, he looks pleasant enough.
- All right.
- Show him in, Radar.
- Uh, yes, sir.
This way, sir.
- Colonel Blake?
- Yes, sir?
Colonel Andropolis, sir.
I am most grateful for the treatment my men have received at your hospital.
Well, we aim to please, sir.
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Thank you.
Uh-oh, I'm afraid the cupboard's a little bare.
Someone's been coming through the rye here.
A drink is not necessary, Colonel.
Well, I usually wait till noon myself.
I just Oh, ah.
Here's some gin.
- Have you ever tried ouzo?
It's a Greek liqueur.
- Oh, yes, I did.
I had a few down in Seoul.
Tried to go to sleep in a wastebasket.
-  Cheers.
- Yep.
Well, here's looking up your old address.
Our Greek Easter, Colonel, is this coming Sunday.
Oh!
Well, happy, uh Athens.
Uh, for those of my men still in hospital here I have arranged for certain delicacies to be airlifted from Greece.
- Oh, that's nice.
- Your people are invited to share them with us.
Oh, well, that's very kind, sir.
Uh, Sunday?
Uh Uh, fine, good.
I'll just cancel the film on the history of athlete's foot.
- Good.
-  Delicacies?
Uh, grape leaves, lamb, moussaka.
- Ouzo?
- Oh, a bathtub full.
Well, I'll practice keeping my head underwater.
Well, I am afraid duty calls.
Good day, and thank you.
- I'm your relief.
- Ah, they couldn't get a doctor, right?
A word about today's lunch: Don't.
It's called Army Surprise yesterday's corned beef hash rehashed in hearts of helmet salad.
- Here you go.
- Which end do you blow in?
That kid, the one whose leg you did Chapman, the arterial reconstruction wound was self-inflicted.
- You noticed.
- The powder burns, the angle.
- You noticed.
- The powder burns, the angle.
For anyone to shoot him that close, they'd have to both be inside the same uniform.
When are they going to put out a manual for these kids on how to self-inflict?
Think Frank knows?
Frank knows so little, it's hard to keep up with how much he doesn't know.
I don't think he knows.
He'd have the kid up on charges in a flash.
- That's his job as head fink.
- To report everything in his finkdom.
Lunch is N.G., huh?
Only if taken internally.
- How do you feel?
- Better.
You're a lucky boy, you know?
If that bullet had gone half an inch the other way, you could've lost your leg.
- Good thing the guy that hit you wasn't that great a shot.
- Yeah.
The cold can really mess up a guy's aim, you know?
The cold, anxiety, fear.
Y-You really know a lot about things, don't you?
People?
That comes from opening them up and peeking inside.
Back at the line, try not to let the same guy shoot you again.
- I think he's looking to hurt you.
- Right.
Also, we need the bed space for serious cases hemorrhoids, hangnails, like that.
Okay.
I won't be back.
Come on.
Eat it.
It's good for you.
It'll put fur on your chest.
Thattaboy or girl.
- Or whatever.
-  Oh, no, not again.
Colonel Blake's office.
The colonel's in conference but if it's important, I can wake him.
No, you can send that stuff through.
Yeah.
That's that Greek shipment we're expecting.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Come on.
Keep bringing it.
Back.
Back, back, back.
Okay, stop.
Stop!
You numbskull!
You almost ran over me!
You understand that, you boob?
Watch Frank blow Greece out of the U.N. I want your name and serial number, Sergeant.
Savvy?
Name-o, numero?
Constantinos Kahtros.
Playing Greek bingo, Frank?
Mind your own beeswax.
Okay, in here.
Uh, this this way, uh, please.
Okay, uh Put 'em here-o, s'il vous plat.
Or I don't speak, uh Thank you.
Wow!
- Shazam!
- Would you look at that beauty stuff.
All this good food will make us sick.
Our bodies can't adjust that fast, after all the slop they've been feeding us.
We may have to go on two or three days of garbage withdrawal.
The last steak I ate I cut out of a magazine.
This stuff looks great, huh?
If you'd studied at all, Radar, you'd know that the Greeks invented the Edible complex.
That's where a boy likes his mother's cooking better than eating out.
- Really?
-  Hey!
That's a lamb!
You bet your mint jelly.
What's he gonna do with that lamb?
If I know our cook, he's gonna make pork chops out of it.
He isn't gonna kill it, is he?
How's he gonna put the pants on the lamb chops if the legs keep moving?
- Aren't you gonna stop him?
- Not until the skin is roasted a crispy brown and there's a suggestion of pink inside.
Mmm!
My neighbor would put a lamb on a rack over charcoal every Easter.
- Mmm!
- And they'd turn it slowly on a spit for hours and then they would baste it with lots of lemon and tons of butter.
Hold it, hold it!
My nostrils could be arrested for indecent exposure.
Attention, all personnel.
Our Greek allies have invited us to join them in their Easter celebration.
There will be music, dancing and a specially barbecued lamb.
That's tomorrow night, the mess tent 2200 hours.
And now, back to the Korean War because you asked for it.
Wild music, dancing barbecuing live animals?
It's paganism, that's what it is.
It'll turn into a bacchanal.
- You think so, Frank?
- I can see it, Colonel.
Wine pouring over supple bodies everyone engaged in debauchery and degradation.
Have to climb over me to do it.
Well, I'm certainly glad Major Houlihan's in Tokyo and not here to witness this.
I'm glad she's not here too, Frank.
This is just the first step.
Today it's a lamb.
Tomorrow you'll sacrifice a virgin.
In this camp?
It's extremely difficult for me to serve under these conditions and to remain as decent as I am.
Let go, Frank.
Rotten up like the rest of us.
You leave me no choice but to register a formal complaint with Father Mulcahy about the looseness around here, the immorality!
- Will that make you happy, Frank?
- Yes!
Then go.
Trouble is, Father Mulcahy does have a rather unfortunate tendency to forgive people.
Shh!
Don't get scared.
I got a plan.
I'm your friend.
Come here.
Listen now.
Uh, I love lambs, see?
I'm your buddy.
I mean, I don't love you like they love you with peas and carrots.
You don't know it, but they're having a party tomorrow night and the only reason why you're not invited is 'cause you're the main course.
Now, listen.
Now, you gotta trust me.
I'm crazy about animals.
Honest.
You can ask 'em.
I've had dogs and hamsters and I got a 20-year-old turtle that I raised from a pup.
Now, see this?
This won't hurt.
It's just to help you to sleep, real fast.
It's better than lying there counting people, right?
Okay, now just turn around.
I gotta inject the, uh, rear of your behind.
Father Mulcahy?
Good thing I don't need the last rites.
Father No.
Dear Father "Father, dear Father, come home with me now".
Silly goose.
-  -  Come.
- Sir?
- Hold on.
- Sir, there's something I want to get off my chest.
- Yes?
I shot myself.
You what?
In the leg, to get sent back, l I shot myself.
Why, you little scum, you.
Shooting yourself?
You oughta be shot for that!
- I thought you'd understand.
- You're talking to a patriot, buddy.
I worship the United States of America for which it stands and, unlike you, I'd do nothing to disgrace it for all the Communists in China!
- You're not the padre.
- No, I'm not, senor.
Let's have your name and serial number.
Right.
Right.
Yeah, the Greek food arrived okay, Colonel, except for the olives.
For some reason they all turned black.
Oh!
Well, anyway, we're mighty grateful for the goodies.
Our own food here leaves a lot to be desired.
- Oh, it fills you up, if you can keep it down.
- Thank you, sir.
Excuse me.
Hang on, Radar.
Uh, right, right.
Okay.
Thanks again, Colonel.
Righty-o.
And, uh, Abyssinia!
What was all that I just signed?
Uh, papers, sir.
What kind of papers were the papers?
Uh, well, uh Uh, well, one paper was to complain that we haven't received the additional paper that we asked for a month ago when we sent in a paper paper, and like that.
- Like what that?
- And you also signed an emergency leave - Oh.
- For one of the men.
Which one of the men?
Uh, Private Charles Lamb.
- I don't remember any Charles Lamb.
- Oh, yes, you know him, sir.
- Short, curly-haired guy.
- Short, curly-haired?
Yes, had to take an emergency leave.
- Death in the family?
- Almost.
SergeantJensen, please report to the dentist's tent.
Your uppers have been waiting a week.
The only problem is, I couldn't stop sneezing - on account of her angora sweater.
-  - Henry's not here.
- Are you sure?
- Sometimes when he's here I get that feeling.
- Why don't you leave the report.
- Where's Colonel Blake?
- Henry's not in, Frank.
- But he is out.
- Can we help?
Just fill this in.
"I Want Out ofThis Rotten, Stinking Army Because" in 25 dirty words or less.
- I happen to be here on very serious business.
- Oh, well.
Well, you're a very serious fellow.
We're thinking of chipping in to buy you a smile.
- Actually, you're just as much to blame.
- Right.
- Right what?
- Whatever.
I'm so neurotic, anything you say, you got a good chance of striking guilt.
Well, you are just as much to blame.
You'll have to sit in the rear of the war.
- Are you going to deny he was your patient?
- A little specificity, Frank.
I've had a few million patients since I got here.
Just last night I pasted a new liver in my scrapbook.
I'm talking about Private Chapman.
His wound was self-inflicted.
A first-year medical student would be able to detect that.
Then how did you find out?
He told me.
Chapman.
- When?
- Why?
Not five minutes ago.
Because he thought I was a priest.
Slowly, Frank.
I was in Father Mulcahy's tent to register a complaint.
Get a little dirt on Saint Christopher, Frank?
I was leaving the good father a note when this Chapman came in on his crutches.
- And you tripped him.
- Hold it.
So?
So nothing.
He confessed the fact that he shot himself.
And now my duty's clear.
You get the rope, Frank.
We'll bring the tree.
Doing one's duty is not performing a lynching.
Frank, look.
A lot of kids have made the same mistake.
- Let him go back and straighten himself out.
- Nerts.
- Probably get ten years.
- Maybe 20.
- I don't think they'd give you that much, Frank.
- Me?
For impersonating a priest.
- A priest?
I never!
- Frank.
You can fool some of the papal some of the time.
- It's a lie!
- And you can count on us not to back you up.
-  Very serious business, this.
- Posing as a priest.
They'll give you the electric pew.
One of these days.
Boy!
Attention, all personnel.
Please contact Colonel Blake if anyone knows the whereabouts of tonight's entrée.
In the meantime, be on the lookout for a white Caucasian lamb.
He is reported to be unarmed and considered to be delicious.
- That is all.
- This whole place is off its rocker.
- What's up, Henry?
- What happened to the lamb?
Do I know?
Do I know anything?
Everything in this country disappears except me.
Boy, would I like to wake up some morning, look down and find myself gone.
You're babbling again, Henry.
Colonel Andropolis has the thing flown in all the way from Greece - and now the damn lamb's flown the coop.
- Now, that's a pretty neat trick.
The U.N. Command in Seoul's called.
Boy, am I in Dutch with the Greeks.
-  - The man's a fountain of straight lines.
Oh, go ahead, joke.
I'm in trouble up to my whatsis.
One more chewing out, and my belly button will cave in.
- Uh, sir?
- Not now, Radar.
- Uh, it's about the lamb, Colonel.
- Where is it?
Well, I don't want you to get in trouble, sir, but, uh, it's been set free.
Well, what horse's patoot did that?
Um, you did, sir.
You gave him a medical discharge this afternoon.
Private Charles Lamb?
-  - Radar, you tricked me!
I didn't want to see him killed, sir.
I'd rather be barbecued myself with an apple shoved up my face.
I gave a discharge to a sheep.
He's on his way to Tokyo now.
On Bo-Peep Airlines.
A buddy of mine will reroute him to Iowa, to my folks.
I've already radioed 'em.
They're expecting him.
- He could sleep in your room.
- Your pants'll just fit him.
I may be losing my mind.
- Don't fight it, Henry.
- I've got Command on my tail and a hospital full of Greeks waiting for a lamb who's sitting on a plane on his way to Iowa to become Radar's little brother!
Henry, you get everybody in the mess tent.
Start pumping ouzo into 'em.
- Trapper and I will supply you with a lamb.
- How are you gonna do that?
- Tell him, Trap.
- You tell him, then we'll both know.
- Hey!
- Pardon me!
What the hell is that?
A Spam lamb!
Come on, kid.
Join the party.
See what a celebration of life is really like.
- I feel out of place.
- Hey, look.
You're old enough to fight, you're old enough to dance.
-  -   -  Ouzo!
-  Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Good evening, Father.
You son of a gun, you.
- Hey!
-  ##
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Holy mackerel!
I'm telling you, we're being shelled!
You hear me?
It's been going on for a half an hour!
Impossible.
My latest intelligence map shows there are no enemy units in your sector.
You are not being shelled, young man.
All personnel, stay clear of the compound!
All personnel!
Listen, buddy, I'm tellin' ya.
They've already knocked out one of our generators, they, uh, smashed our water tank, and we got three people wounded.
Well, listen, if you don't believe me, listen for yourself!
Did ya Did Did ya Hello?
Hello?
Aw!
Here he is now, your star for tonight, Bob Hope!
Come here, Pierce, you wanna see some fancy needlework.
Not now, Henry.
I gotta control some bleeding.
- More suction, Sanchez.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Fix that mask!
Kelly!
- Sí!
Sí!
Mucho apreciado.
Major, your hands are shaking.
It has nothing to do with the shelling.
It's, uh, my sinus condition.
If anybody's scared, just let yourself be scared.
You have nothing to fear but fear itself.
Eleanor Roosevelt.
-  -  Sanchez, stop that!
Colonel, your hands are shaking.
Well, it's, uh, Frank's sinus condition.
I'm finished.
Okay, get a dressing on that.
How ya doin', Pierce?
This kid's navel's gonna be a showplace.
Here we are on the U.S.S. Look at this craft.
Isn't it something?
Now I know what they mean by a "floating crap table".
Oh, my God!
This man's a North Korean!
I'm not operating on any Commie!
- Oh, come on, Frank.
Come on!
- Well, what did they ever do for me?
They fixed it so you could get a nice uniform, a steady job, and people salute you before they get to know you.
- Hold it steady, Sanchez.
- Es que me tiemblan las manos, doctor.
Los tiros, no estoy acostumbrada.
- Suction, cha-cha-cha.
- Could I have some gloves?
The patient's ready, Doctor.
I hope my American Legion post doesn't find out about this.
They'll take away your joy buzzer.
- Aw Oh!
-  Get some restraint on him, fast!
That's it!
I refuse to operate on that slant-eyed, yellow devil!
Finish here!
I'll take care of him, you wonderful round-eye.
Where did that Costa Rican nurse come from, anyway?
The U.N. The little place on the East Side?
Foreigners!
Why are there so many of them in a war?
Somebody put this guy under.
Pierce, I gotta get to the latrine for about five minutes.
- I'll handle it.
- I'd rather do it myself.
Leland!
Somebody put this guy under, will ya?
-  Give me a towel!
- Put a blanket over that window!
Keep calm, everybody.
This can't go on much more than forever.
Come on.
Give me that glove.
Get it on!
Come on!
Margaret.
We're gonna need a lot of sulfa.
- We've got plenty.
- Somebody, come quick!
- What happened?
- It's Col.
Blake!
He's in the latrine!
- Hurray for regularity.
- It's been hit!
He's trapped!
- Debride the wound.
- Kelly, I need clean gloves!
-  -   If anything's happened to Col.
Blake, I don't know what I'll do.
He's the "bestest" colonel that ever lived!
- What seat did he usually use?
- On the far side.
Picture window.
Here.
- Henry?
Henry?
-  Wait a minute!
Hold it!
Shh!
I heard a moan!
Colonel, if you can hear me, knock three times!
If you can't, knock twice!
- Oh, Lord, he's dead.
- Colonel!
Henry, you all right?
That's him!
That's him!
His wife sent it!
Stateside paper, for their anniversary!
Colonel!
Oh!
Watch my other arm.
I think it's broken.
Oh, my.
Aw, man.
- Careful, sir.
- Mulcahy's still down there.
-  Ooh.
Get him out.
- Come here, Henry.
- Where's Mulcahy?
- Come here.
Father Mulcahy was on my left, telling me about his sister.
-  Here he is!
-  Help him.
- You all right, Father?
- Come on, Father.
Sis and I picked up these apples from under the tree.
I remember I said, "You can't make a pie out of crab apples," and she said, "I learned how in the Girl Scouts".
He'll be all right.
He's just a little dazed.
She used brown sugar, and the crust was just so crispy and nice.
Well, it was so good, we ate it all before dinner.
Get him back to his tent.
Let him rest.
Mommy came into the kitchen and said, "What the hell's going on in here"?
I remember, Mommy.
You know, that was the first time I ever heard you swear.
-  Careful.
- Henry, let me get a look at that arm.
Bet that hurts.
Happy anniversary, sir.
Come on.
Take that toilet paper!
Boy, this really hurts.
Just be glad it's not your right arm, or your career as a surgeon would go down the tubes.
Never mind that.
What about my backswing?
Anybody got any gloves?
Kelly?
Hey, Pierce, can you get a Purple Heart for a toilet wound?
Colonel, was the officers' latrine really destroyed?
"Was the officers' latrine really destroyed"?
Gone with the wind, Frank.
I hate the thought of using the enlisted men's.
Get one of your own.
Go into business for yourself.
Good idea.
-  And another one.
-  Right here.
-  And another one.
-  Right here.
Sanchez, come over here.
Help me get this man undressed.
There's a wire across his chest.
Don't touch him!
That guy's booby-trapped!
- There's a grenade under his arm!
- Now, that offends.
-  "Booby"?
- Booby kaboom.
- Big "booby"?
- Right.
The pin is off.
The wire is holding his arm to the handle of the grenade.
Pretty dicey.
Listen, we don't have to risk our own lives.
We have a demolition expert right here in camp.
Staff Sergeant Benson.
Frank this is Staff Sergeant Benson.
Well, tell him to tuck his giblets back in and get back to work.
It seems to me this comes under the heading of duty for enlisted personnel.
- Oh, really!
- Well, they do get their uniforms free, and we have to pay for ours!
We're all scared.
If you're that scared, get out!
You'll talk about me behind my back.
Trap, we're gonna have to do this together.
- You cut the wire.
- You hold the grenade.
And I'll be in Scotland before you.
-  He's moving!
- Frank, put him under, fast!
Hold him down.
Put your arm on his chest.
Hurry up!
- Man, that's a hairy armpit.
- Probably Italian.
-  -  - Sanchez!
-  Okay, Trap, cut.
Okay, quick!
Towards the minefield!
Ay!
Yo tengo miedo!
Yo no estoy acostumbrada a esos tiros!
Soy muy joven, no quiero morir!
I seem to have a foreign object on my chest.
All right, cover the wound!
Somebody, clean this stuff up!
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
It's all over.
- No more booby?
- Booby all gone.
- George, cover that wound, will ya?
- Gee, I'm busy here, sir.
-  -  I am so afraid.
You no afraid?
- You are afraid.
- You bet your enchilada.
No, sir, I did not hang up on you.
L-I put the phone out the window, and it blew up!
Reluctantly, I have to admit that latest intelligence tells me you are being shelled.
But there's nothing to worry about.
You're being hit by your own artillery.
Well, is there anything you can do about it?
We're being wiped out!
I tried to phone the observation post directing the fire, but they're all at "The Bob Hope Show".
Hello?
Hello?
What'd you pull it apart for?
I just fixed it!
If I ever get out of this war alive, I'm gonna write a book exposing it all, and that guy's gonna be in it!
- What's his name?
- I'll make one up!
- Will you put me in it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Page one.
- Hot cher-o-kees!
Settle down someplace.
Take a load off your arm.
Yeah.
Where?
My tent's been flattened.
First time in six months I get a toothbrush that's just right.
Not too hard, not too soft.
I got teeth like Turhan Bey.
I can't even find the damn bristles.
Radar, did you get through to anybody?
Yes, sir, H.Q. We're being shelled by our own artillery.
They never miss.
I need help.
The door to the supply room is jammed.
- We're running short on everything.
- I'll give you a hand.
Let's go.
Radar, get on the phone and get some help.
- Klinger has to fix it first!
- Then fix it, Klinger!
You ought to put him in your book too!
Put him in your own book!
Ten years in medical school, and I wind up a sheet metal worker!
-  - Let me try.
You are strong.
Where I was raised, every morning we ran naked in the snow.
We ran naked in the subway.
Plasma?
Uh, plasma, sulfa, uh, extra blankets.
- Oh, and Pierce needs rubber gloves.
- Clothes horse.
Doctor, are you hurt?
Just the old football injury.
- Knee?
- Hemorrhoid.
I spent a lot of time on the bench.
We better get outta here.
It won't open!
- Come on.
Let me try.
- We're trapped!
- This day's been too much!
-  I just can't take it anymore!
-  - Come on, honey.
Take it easy.
It's all right.
I'm so embarrassed.
- Why?
-  I outrank you!
Easy, honey.
Easy.
Easy.
Everybody thinks I'm so tough and hard and efficient, and here I am, crying like a baby.
- Do you mind?
- No.
It's the first hot water to hit my body in a year.
You're so understanding John.
No!
No, please.
Look, we can't get outta here, and I sure don't wanna take inventory.
The door's jammed!
We've got cots, blankets and a lot of extra plasma.
Help, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
All that energy wasted on a door.
Come here.
- Help.
-  Father, this is a lousy idea.
The movie was supposed to take their minds off the shelling.
Lord knows, I tried.
I sent for The Yearling.
A dandy picture.
About a boy and his pet deer.
Y-You see, his mother didn't want him to keep it, but they became very emotionally attached.
I know, I know.
My cousin Floyd had the same thing with a goat.
So, uh, what happened to The Yearling?
Oh, the jeep was hijacked by some Buddhist monks.
- Monks?
- Oh, the driver told me they'd all gotten haircuts that day and wanted to celebrate.
- Is, uh, Major Houlihan here?
- Down in front!
Get outta the way!
- Has anyone seen her?
- I saw her about an hour ago.
She and Captain Mclntyre were running across the compound.
- Well, where were they going?
- Search me.
- A war picture?
- I tried to get The Yearling.
It's about this boy who becomes emotionally attached to a deer.
Oh, my uncle in Texarkana had the same thing with a mule.
Why can't I have a blanket of my own?
Conservation of body heat.
Ninety-eight degrees plus ninety-eight degrees is 196 degrees.
It doesn't work that way.
You're just saying 196 degrees so you can get under the same blanket with me.
Are you questioning a doctor's medical opinion?
What are you doing with your hands?
Just saluting.
I don't trust you.
You don't trust me?
John Xavier Mclntyre?
In my grammar school, on graham cracker day, I was elected crumb boy.
That's silly.
Now, I'm gonna lie down because I'm cold and tired.
You have to promise me, no hanky-panky.
I haven't even got a hanky, and I left my "panky" in my other suit.
Besides, you have nothing to worry about.
I'm beat.
Hello, hello, hello.
Oh.
We, uh, came in here for supplies, and a shell hit and the door jammed.
- That's good for starters.
- Mclntyre, what's the meaning of this?
Frank, does paradise need a meaning?
We came in here for supplies, and a shell hit and the door jammed, and we made 196 degrees, and that's all there was to it!
Just a trip to the moon on gossamer wings.
Attention.
By order of Colonel Blake, all personnel will prepare a survival pack in case we have to evacuate.
- Evacuate to where?
-  Now the Book of the Month Club will never find me.
- Here, Trapper, you take this bottle.
- Check.
We better go in separate trucks.
That way one of us will be alive to care for our loved ones.
Uh, Major Houlihan claims that you were a perfect gentleman at all times in the supply room.
- These enough?
- Yeah.
If we're captured, we'll eat 'em.
When fear is near, I want you here.
Mclntyre, the future is very uncertain for all of us.
I want your word that nothing went on between you and Major Houlihan.
Absolutely nothing.
-  -  No kidding?
- I heard that!
- What?
Well, I couldn't hear it.
What did you tell Pierce?
Just boy talk.
You taking all those nudist magazines with you?
Yeah, I'm reading a serial.
It's called "The Sunburnt Fool".
- Terrific.
- It's the story of a woman who smuggles ten pounds of pistachio ice cream out of a nudist camp.
Ooh, that smarts.
You You That's what you are!
What's your rush, Frank?
The next shell isn't due for three minutes.
Can't trust these P.X. Clocks for anything.
Mclntyre keeps hinting that something went on, Margaret.
We were exhausted.
We slept.
I told you.
Second shift to surgery, please.
How can you wash your hair at a time like this?
Well, if I'm goin' out, I'm goin' out with a clean scalp.
I don't understand what a woman could see in that man, anyway.
Egotistical smart aleck.
He didn't even study medicine in his own state.
Frank, he does have a certain je ne sais quoi.
I should have known he'd talk dirty to you in Spanish.
Frank, I've told you over and over and over!
We didn't do anything!
Hmm.
How far did he get?
First base?
Second base?
Home plate?
What difference does it make?
What am I to you, anyway?
A beautiful plaything.
A romp on an army blanket.
Oh, that's not true!
We're soul mates.
Don't we listen to Mantovani together?
Don't we both trim the crusts on our bread?
Remember the morning when we held hands and said the Pledge of Allegiance?
Talk, talk, talk.
Talk.
Margaret, I realized when you were in the supply room with him - how much I love you.
- Hmm.
Margaret - I want to marry you.
-  - What did you say?
- I said l  - Say it again, Frank.
- What?
What?
Tell me again, what you said about marriage.
Boy, that last one was awful close!
I better go see Colonel Blake!
You weasel!
From Seoul in South Korea, it's been "The Bob Hope Show," with Marilyn Maxwell, Jerry Colonna, Les Brown and his Band of Renown, - and yours truly, Hy Averback.
-  ##  What is?
- Take it easy, Sanchez.
- He's dead?
Klinger!
Next patient!
This is Seoul City Sue, bringing you G.I. Joes your favorite songs and reminding you that all your wives and sweethearts are being unfaithful to you.
Not true!
Not true!
Don't pay any attention to her!
You know who's romancing them at home every night?
Every Tom, Dick and Harry.
There is a Harry at the country club.
Nah!
Lorraine wouldn't horse around with a busboy.
Take Sue's word for it.
Go home, 121 st Evac, MASH 4077.
Go home where the big money is.
Don't help the imperialistic forces in Korea.
Another Harry repairs the golf carts.
Nah!
He's got dirty nails and he's always digging one finger in his ear.
I'll be right back, but first here's a golden oldie to remind you of those wonderful cheating wives and mothers back home.
Father, will you ask Radar to get something else on the box?
Yes, sir!
Oh, jeepers.
Frank, you okay?
I've got to get into this chest, and I don't know if I can do it.
You can do it.
You've done that before.
- I've just got so much on my mind.
- Suction.
Frank, Trapper tried, but no dice.
She's all yours.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
All right, let's move it.
Get cracking.
Get gloves.
And I want an anesthetist over here on the double!
- Scalpel, Sanchez.
- Sí, doctor.
What's that noise?
Sounds like silence.
Hey, the shelling stopped.
- No more boom-boom?
- No more boom-boom.
Testing.
Te One, two, three.
Testing, one, two.
Radar here.
Uh, there's nobody on the radio now except Seoul City Sue, so I figured I'd keep you entertained by reading you a letter from my mom.
- Everybody dance.
-  Here goes.
"Dear Son: I got your lovely letter.
You certainly asked a lot of questions".
"About the car.
You may.
"AboutJennifer next door.
Yes.
"About Eleanor Simon.
She did once or twice, but not too much.
"About your Uncle Albert.
"Uh, no on drinking.
Yes on A.A. "About the dog, Leon.
"Three times in the bedroom, once under the washer, and twice on the cat".
Testing, testing.
"About the cat.
We don't have one anymore.
- Uh, about your Cousin Ernie" -  -  -  Here we go again!
- Watch out!
- Oh, ding bust it.
I wanted to hear about Cousin Ernie.
Get ready to close.
Three-oh silk.
Get the next one ready.
Get a blanket on the window over there!
-  -   Okay.
You guys Come on.
Major Burns?
Psst.
Major Burns, don't we have something to discuss?
Something you asked me in my tent?
Tell us, Major.
We're his answering service.
The doctor isn't in.
Leave your name, symptoms and credit card number.
Tell him he's not gonna welsh out on it!
Frank.
Did you propose?
Hmm?
- Uh - Figures.
He was afraid he was gonna lose her to you.
Frank, what kind of a guy do you think I am?
We're colleagues surgeons under the skin, in mortal combat with the enemy.
Besides, they'll have plenty of time together after you've gone home.
Care for a little tonic?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
- 71.
Beat that.
- Aw, 71.
- Come on.
Beat it.
- That's nothin'.
You watch this.
- Ready?
One.
-  What'd you do, change balls on me?
What's the announcement, Radar?
It's a lecture.
Colonel Blake's gonna tell us everything he knows about sex.
That should be an enjoyable 60 seconds.
Look at this.
No eyes.
Good afternoon, men.
Now, first of all, let me thank all of you in advance for what I know will be your full and undivided attention.
-  -  The topic for today has to do with the subject of sex.
All right, all right.
Now let's not go gaga.
Sex happens to be one of the most important things in life inasmuch as each one of us is one or the other gender of it once we're born, which is the direct result of the act of it.
- Sir?
- Uh, we'll have questions after the lecture.
What about answers?
I was just wondering, should I roll down the flaps so the nurses don't hear?
Radar, all the nurses have heard about sex.
- I know I've been spreading the word.
- Shut your face!
- Kiss me.
-  Okay, now the aspect of today's subject that I'm going to delve on is the U.S. Army's contribution to birth control.
- I knew they were gonna ask for contributions.
- I gave at the office.
Now each of us here knows why, uh he is in Korea.
Major Burns.
We are here to stem the red tide, to finish up the Commies once and for all.
Anyone with half a mind knows, as I do, that, after Germany we should've knocked out the Russkies, then clobbered the Chinese before they forced Chiang Kai-shek and his very beautiful wife off the mainland.
To which I, for one, say they should be unleashed so that they can liberate the real Chinese people and restore the government that America's paid so many millions of dollars to help get.
Sir.
I thought the lecture was on sex.
I didn't iron my dress to talk politics.
- Sit down, Klinger.
- Now listen, Corporal You, too, Frank.
We're in Korea by order of the U.N., along with 17 other nations to try to stabilize this country politically and militarily.
We are not here to add to the population.
The one thing they don't need in Asia is more Asians.
Many of you have heard me speak on reproduction and V.D. I've got both your albums.
But today's subject is much more important.
Now, this country is on its can.
There's not enough food, housing, schools.
You name it they haven't got it.
So don't add to its problems.
Now, uh, when you're shipped home just make sure that you don't leave any little time bombs that are gonna go off nine months later.
Now, I know you're only human.
Present company excepted.
We don't expect you to behave like monks.
The army just wants you to be careful so that you don't leave behind any little "monklets".
Attention, all personnel.
See the bulletin board for details on the payroll savings plan.

- I forgot my name.
- Amnesia.
Happens every time somebody wants me to invest in a war.
Well, bullets cost bucks, mister.
I'd like that tattooed on my thigh.
You're both a blemish on the record of this unit.
I'm gonna do something to get rid of the blemishes tonight.
Uh, ach, du lieber.
You get the feeling Frank's one war behind?
Did you see this announcement?
-  - Frank?
You alone?
Where are they?
Oh, they said something about nurse molesting.
- I want to see you.
- I have a headache, Margaret.
No, no.
I have a favor to ask of you.
Oh, anything, darling.
You know that.
My sister's getting married.
My younger sister is getting married.
And she's only a captain.
Oh, marriage isn't all that it's cracked up to be.
Let me tell you, honestly.
No.
Marriage is probably the chief cause of divorce.
I want to borrow $240 for a wedding present.
It's key money for an apartment.
- Two hundred and - And $40.
Surely I'm worth $240.
- Frank?
- Every penny.
But I wish I could.
I really do, but But all your money's tied up in wealth, right?
Oh, those are just bonds.
You've bought enough to start your own country.
- Shh!
- I just wanna borrow $240.
But don't you have the money, Margaret?
Dear?
Didn't your dad leave you a bit?
Mother drank it.
Half my salary goes toward drying her out and the other half for bail.
Bail?
When she's sober she's a klepto.
She was caught in a store last week stuffing a radio up her jumper.
- Frank?
- Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
I just can't do it.
It rubs against the grain.
"Neither a lender nor a borrower be".
Polonius.
"To give and not count the cost".
St. Ignatius Loyola.
"The holy passion of friendship is of so sweet "and steady and loyal and enduring a nature "that it will last throughout a whole lifetime if not asked to lend money".

Margaret Houlihan.
The morale officer would like to remind all personnel not to be "negilgent"  uh, negligent about writing to the folks back home.
Remember, you gotta write 'em to get 'em.
- ##  -  Dear Becky I hope you had a nice birthday party.
I'd have given anything to be there.
In your last letter, you said I never really tell you what I'm doing.
Well, now that you're all of seven I'll try to describe what it's like over here.
-  - First of all, I live in a tent which is kind of old and smelly, which I share with two doctors who are young and smelly.
One is Hawkeye Pierce.
He's a good egg but just a little grumpy when it comes to waking up.
Come on.
Everybody up.
Rise and shine!
- Hawk?
- I'm up!
Get up on your feet up.
Korea?
The war still?
Right.
What's to get up?
I left a call for half past peace.
Night shift.
Come on.
Let's go.
Up.
Wait!
Wait!
Wait a minute!
Why are we wasting this on each other for?
Major Burns is Daddy's other tent mate sort of like a substitute teacher that stays all year.
Like us, he's here to patch up the soldiers as best we can.
They don't ever seem to stop coming.
It's very routine work, except once in a while like last December.
Put him to sleep.
- Colonel.
- Yo.
His feet, sir.
- Oh, God!
More frost?
- Three toes, at least.
When the hell is the army gonna develop a boot that works?
I'm almost finished.
You want to turn down that gas before this private floats to the top of the room?
-  - Okay, sir.
Thanks for the break.
- I'll take over.
- Pressure and pulse are stable.
Why don't you check the other tables?
- Maybe somebody left a tip.
- Aw, baloney!
- Major Burns!
- What is it?
Chopper plucked him off a mine field.
He was there all night.
- Get this body outta here, P.D.Q. - He dead, sir?
Of course.
Froze to death.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
Hold it.
What do you got?
Deceased, Mclntyre.
I checked it.
Are you "deef'?
I said "deceased".
Kaput.
No pulse, no heartbeat.
- Okay.
Take him back.
Let's go.
- Ooh!
We might be able to save this guy.
Uh, get me a cut-down tray and four units of O-negative blood.
- You get a pulse?
- Not in the arm.
- Like I said.
- Cut the shirt.
Let's go.
Frank, his extremities are frozen.
You didn't check the carotid.
You ever hear of hypothermia?
He only knows what's condensed in Reader's Digest.
You get anything?
A faint beat.
Where's the, uh Oh, great.
Frank, hypothermia is a state of reduced body temperature slowing down all functions.
- I knew that.
- Get me some blankets and a prep tray.
- Frank, you prep.
- Right.
This guy thaws out, he's liable to start bleeding.
What happened, Radar?
He was in a mine field all night long.
He's a lucky fella.
If this had been summer, he would've bled to death.
That's it for now, baby.
I'd like to be able to tell you when I'm coming home -  - But, for a while now, all I can do is stay here and make the best of it.
-  -   Attention, all personnel.
Tonight's movie is a holdover from last week and will be shown right after supper which is also a holdover from last week.
-  - # Nya nya nya nya nya nya nya # # Nya nya nya nya nya nya nya # # Nya nya nya nya nya nya nya # -  -  Down in front.

I'm glad we finally got a new film.
Sure beats Twelve Ways to Infiltrate a Nazi Bunker.
You wanna remove your hat, lady?
How would you like me to remove your teeth?
-  - Sit down, or I'll make you eat your bra.
- I only dress like this to get outta the army.
-  You're too pretty.
They'll never let you go.
I'd like some popcorn, please.
- ## -  - Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
- Just get by.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
-  -  Hey.

- Hi.
Thank you.
- Watch your hands.
Both of them.
- What?
- What the hell!
- Keep your hands to yourself.
Huh?
I swear, Henry, these fingers never left my hands.
Well, don't look at me.
I only fool around with girls.
Will you sirs kindly mind?
It's Shirley Temple.
She's not really a kid, Radar.
Her mother stunted her growth made her sleep in a short bed and smoke.
- She's 42 years old.
- Aw!
Please.
- Heh!
- Heh!
Doctor?
That patient is hemorrhaging again.
Oh, Lord.
All right, let's go.
Excuse me.
Pardon me, sir.
- I'm sorry.
Pardon me.
-  Not you again?
-  - Klinger, sit down!
- Move it.
- This seat is taken.
Oh, no, it isn't.
It's empty.
Can you believe that guy?
Hey!
Break it up back there!
You can't fight in here.
Can't somebody stop that?
Hey, stop it!
Break it up!
Knock it off!
Come on!
Knock it off!
- Now cut it out!
Stop it!
-  Would you mind holding it down?
I came all the way to Korea to see this picture.
-  - They're shelling us!
Stop the film!
-  - We gotta take cover!
Just where are we gonna hide, Frank?
We're stuck here with our brass hanging out.
- Brasses.
- Right.
Thank you.
Come on.
Sit down.
See this, Henry?
See this, Henry?
"First Annual Polly Adler Birthday Cookout, Picnic and Barbecue.
All proceeds to go to Sister Teresa's Korean Orphans'Fund.
" Forget it.
Henry.
You did everything you could.
Loosen up.
You'll have a ball.
That's just it.
Everybody unwinds, has a good time.
Then the war comes back, and it's a real belly drop.
Look, we need this.
If we don't go crazy once in a while, we'll all go crazy.
- ## - ## ## ##   I missed you so much.
Oh, I love you, Judy.
I came back because I missed you, Judy.
Oh, I'm so glad you came back, Punch.

I love you.
I miss you.
- Oh, I love you.

- Oh, that was just -  - Ah.
Oh.
This is lovely.
That's very nice.
Lovely.
I'm not doin' too great for the orphans, Father.
No?
How much so far?
Three nurses.
Three bucks.
I could make more, but you wouldn't believe what they expect for a dollar.
Oh.
Well, do your best, my, uh, my son.
Thank you.
Uh You fill the spoon with water.
You take the water down and put it in the glass.
And then you run back with the spoon and give the spoon to your partner.
Don't spill any water.
We don't want to make Korea messy.
- Ready?
-      Come on, Sister!
With a field like that, Father, you can't lose.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, Sister!
Oh, Yeah!
The winner!
- Congratulations.
-   I'm the bonus prize for the winner.
I get the loser.
My father told me to stay away from fast women.
You've been avoiding me, Margaret.
Actually, I've been ignoring you, Frank.
I'll get around to avoiding you later.
What is it, sugar?
Everyone else is having such fun.
I thought we could be in the sack race together.
You can forget about us being in the sack race for a while.
And anytime you want, you can pick up your bathing cap and your chenille robe.
Margaret, what is it?
I'll give you Oh, I get it.
It's the money, isn't it?
You bet your clusters, sweetie.
You wouldn't really let money come between us?
I There There is no us, Frank.
There's just me.
The only us that you're a part of is Mrs. Multi-Chin Sensible Shoes.
Now blow!
-  - Go!
Go!
Go!
I'll get it, Margaret.
The money the 240.
Really, Frank?
Honest, darling?
- Do you mean it?
- That's what I said.
- Oh, Frank!
-  Oh, you don't have to do that.
- One thing I would like though.
- Anything.
When I give you the money, if you could sign an I.O.U. Well, it's really a good idea when you lend An I.O.U. And some mention of the interest?
- The interest?
- Yeah.
I thought five percent.
That's better than you'd get at any bank.
Oh!
Frank Burns!
- Frank!
-  Oh!
Oh!
First prize has been graciously donated by Corporal Max Klinger.
He always wanted a double-barreled slingshot.
Come on, Henry.
Loosen up a little and have some fun.
- Grab the rope.
- All right, I'll grab the rope.
- Oh!
- Hey, hey!
Wait a minute.
Who figured out this linuep?
It's by rank, Henry.
Uh-huh, except for the old Illini anchorman.
It's good for your complexion.
Come on.
All right.
Let 'er rip!
-  -  Who turned out the lights?
Hey!

And Sergeant Morrie Mandel announces he is divorcing his Sylvia.
In Washington, Republican candidate Dwight Eisenhower said if he's elected, he'll go to Korea.

Good idea, that picnic.
Yes, Henry.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
- Morning, sir.
- Drive over to the Swamp.
Yes, sir.
- Radar!
- Gee, sir, why'd you run?
I could've driven you.
- Yeah, right.
-  Pierce!
Mclntyre!
Oh, hello, Henry.
Sorry Trapper can't come out and play today but he's being a bad boy and he won't stop sucking his socks.
Can it, will ya?
You jokers were supposed to be packed and ready at 0800.
I know, but Trapper refuses to get in the suitcase.
- Come on, shake your tail!
- Not in front of Radar.
Here you go, caddy, put these in my car.
Hey, what're you taking these clubs for?
I tried to get a couple of nurses in, but they wouldn't fit.
Look, you're supposed to be going toJapan to attend a surgical clinic.
They're expecting you to show up at Tokyo General Hospital.
Henry, I promise you we'll drive by the building.
On our way to the golf course.
Be a sport, Henry, help us out.
We don't wanna wear ourselves out and disappoint the geishas.
How much do you think we should tip him?
Book says a quarter a bag.
- All right, Radar, take us to the airport.
- Yes, sir.
Where'd you learn to drive?
- The bumper cars.
- Figures.
My kidneys' lawyer will call you in the morning.
Now, listen, you guys, you better check out that clinic or somebody'll put my butt in a sling.
- It'll improve your posture.
- I'm gonna miss you guys.
- Don't blubber in front of the troops.
- Bring me back something.
No chance.
We're gonna be careful.
- Bye-bye, Radar.
- See ya, sirs.
Do your homework.
- Okay, Radar, back to the compound.
- Yes, sir!
## ## - Should we try the bar?
- All right, but I can only stay three days.
Excuse us.
This place serve servicemen?
Bartender.
What are you drinking?
- I'd love a zombie.
- Necrophiliac.
- A zombie, please.
- Yes, sir.
- Keep making 'em until I turn into one.
- I'll have a scotch and water.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll drink the scotch now and come by tomorrow for the water.
- You look like you could use another drink.
- You must be psychic.
No, actually I'm a physic.
I can predict all your future movements.
- The same, please.
- Yes, sir.
Vodka Gibson.
- Me too.
- You're having scotch.
You can't mix drinks.
Right.
Put 'em in separate glasses.
Major, I'm John Mclntyre.
This is Hawkeye Pierce.
Is it all right for you two to be in an officers' club?
We're captains.
We tore our bars off when we went over the wall.
Anthony Borelli.
The rank is honorary.
I'm here as a civilian medical consultant.
- Yeah?
Where's home?
- San Francisco.
I loved a girl in San Francisco once.
No, twice.
- Gentlemen.
- Ah, here we are.
- Happy days.
- In the army?
Don't you like soldier suits?
- Whooh!
Our invitations to the clinic read "informal".
- You're doctors.
- Surgeons.
- I'm a gynecologist for the F.B.I. You over here to tell us everything you know?
Should take about ten minutes.
I'm looking forward to meeting you at the lectures.
- You'll look backward to seeing us.
- We're not coming.
We're over here for the girls.
We're gonna take a refresher course in getting our faces slapped.
There are some very fine doctors who've come a long way to discuss some new surgical techniques.
We're from a MASH unit.
We work three, four miles from the front.
- Meatball surgery.
- Seven tables, no waiting.
Kids come in fresh from the field.
We get a lot of belly wounds, a lot of dangling limbs.
We get 'em ready for Tokyo fast.
Not much time for technique.
We're closing 'em up even before we can get our hands out.
Sounds challenging.
We're not there by choice.
We were snatched from our cradles by gypsies and sold to the army.
- Ready for another?
- Oh, no, thanks, I'm fine.
Bartender, two more.
If you're trying to get me drunk, it'll probably work.
- Ever been to Korea, Doctor?
- No.
Oh, you'd love it.
In addition to trauma surgery and wholesale amputation we've got typhus, filariasis encephalitis, typhoid, paratyphoid and cholera.
Korea's the Detroit of bacteria.
We operate in the filth.
- In the mud.
- In the muck.
- Muck and mud.
- Who'll ever forget them?
- Gentlemen.
- Arigato.
I'll tell you what, Doc.
You wanna really be useful over here?
Stop hanging out in the cozy locker room in Tokyo.
If you and your pals wanna really get in the game come out to a MASH unit or an aid station.
- Come back to the front with us.
- Or front to the back with us.
No, thanks.
I saw my share of the front lines in World War I and II.
Fair enough.
To World War None.
Have a good stay, Doctor.
Get your net.
We're starting a Madame Butterfly collection.
- Radar, this is heaven.
- Yes, sir.
- You're a genius.
- Ah, yes, sir.
Colonel Blake, you are not listening to me!
Uh, you'll have to speak up, Frank.
I'm not listening to you.
- The water could be just a titch warmer.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Colonel, I have incontrovertible proof that Pierce and Mclntyre did not attend one single lecture the whole time they were in Tokyo.
They spent the entire three days in the company of geisha girls bargirls and female golf caddies.
I ought to have them whipped, although they probably are.
- Is that all you can say?
- Look, Frank, they didn't get arrested and I count that for something.
Now just let me soak in this pool until I get nice and wrinkled, okay?
Colonel, do you not understand  - Oh, pooh, I forgot my sunglasses.
- Take mine.
Degenerates!
You peeked.
I believe that's the pool just ahead.
Right next to the outhouse.
All right, Henry, out of the pool.
I'm gonna do 35 laps.
We have to stay in shape in case we're drafted.
Look out!
Frank tells me you guys didn't attend one lecture.
- Couldn't, Henry.
- We got sick and had to have round the clock nurses.
- You characters.
- Chopper.
- Wounded?
- No announcement.
I'll be damned.
Who is that man?
Don't you know?
That's the Lone Ranger.
Sir.
Why don't you let me put you up in the V.I.P. Tent, Doctor?
You'd be a whole lot more comfortable.
I've had enough of the locker room, Colonel.
I came to get into the game.
You couldn't have picked any place gamier.
You must be hungry after your trip.
We've got a very fine mess tent.
The tent is terrific.
The food puts you away.
- Excuse me, sir.
I've laid out your things.
- Thank you, Radar.
- You're welcome, sir.
- Radar, why don't you Yes, sir, I'll arrange a tour for Dr. Borelli right away.
- I'd have bet anything that you wouldn't have come.
- Won't they miss you in Tokyo?
I'm a civilian.
They going to bust me from a Mister down to a Miss?
So, this is Korea?
- You'll find it everything we said it wasn't.
- It's cold, smelly and poor.
- But it is unpleasant.
-  - Artillery.
- Ours?
- And theirs.
- It's a set.
Great place for the doctor business.
Beginning of the year, over a two-month period this unit treated almost 5,000 casualties.
- That's incredible.
- Well, I had help, of course.
Colonel, we heard Dr. Borelli was with us.
Oh, Dr. Borelli, this is our chief nurse, Major Margaret Houlihan.
- Major.
- Sir.
-  - Oh, and that's Major Burns.
- Major.
- Honorary.
I'm a doctor, not really a major.
Perfect.
Frank's a major who's not really a doctor.
- Pierce.
- Just a little white truth.
What brings you to the 4077, Doctor?
I couldn't get these two to listen to me lecture in Tokyo so I came over here to bore them.
- Oh, I'm sure you'll be anything but boring.
- Anything but.
Well, there's two "buts" who say you're wrong.
Hmm.
Feels like it's going to martini.
- Great idea.
-  Attention, all personnel.
Incoming wounded.
Both shifts report to the O.R. On the double.
Let's go.
- Well, you got here just in time, Doctor.
- Pretty exciting.
Let's hope you feel that way about nausea.
- Let me have some suction there, will ya, Gwen?
- Yes, sir.
Look at that.
Those are my sutures.
There and there.
This is the third time through here for this kid.
Must like your work.
Come on, gimme a wipe, will ya?
I'm sweating like a pig.
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- You're welcome, darling.
- Artillery.
- You've got noisy neighbors, Father.
Dress this for me.
This leg's badly crushed, and there's no way of saving it.
- Give me a knife and have a saw ready.
- Wait.
You don't have to amputate.
- But the artery is crushed.
- You can do an arterial transplant.
A new segment of artery can be grafted in place of the damaged portion.
Dr. Borelli, what you're saying is new to us.
But then, uh, clean sheets would be new to us.
Well, the operation is similar to coarctation of the aorta where the narrowed area was removed and the two ends sewn together.
Have you ever done this operation before, Doctor?
Yes, and it works.
All you need is a section of new artery.
If we haven't got one, we can call around to other outfits.
I am sick to death of sending kids home in only one boot.
If you're going to do it, you better move fast.
That leg's not gonna last more than another four or five hours.
Colonel, we've never tried this before.
Someone could get into trouble.
Radar!
Come on, come on.
Hello, Charlie Company?
Listen, it's me again.
I'm still looking for that piece of artery.
Have you got any casualties?
I am not a ghoul!
I work in a hospital!
I do!
How'd ya like a specimen in your ear, fella?
Hello, Able?
Yeah, he's still holding.
Look I can't hear you.
Boy, you got the war on loud there!
- I'm looking for Don't go away.
-  Wait a minute.
Just hold on.
MASH 4077.
Oh, yeah, listen, I've been trying to get you.
We've got less than four hours to perform an arterial transplant, and I need -  - Hold on a second.
Hold on.
MASH 407 You can?
You have?
You will?
Forget it!
Forget it!
Shoot!
What's the story with those two?
- He's a creep.
- She's a creepette.
They met in adjoining jars in medical school.
Well, a person doesn't have to be an eye doctor to see what's going on here.
I don't know what you're talking about, Frank.
Keep drooling down your front, you'll have to change your bra.
Frank!
- Great coffee.
- Drink between the grounds.
My money's on Radar.
I got it!
A British outfit's had heavy casualties.
They'll let us have one.
- How far away are they?
- Sixteen miles up Broadway.
- A couple, three hours there and back.
- Let's go.
- You all right?
- Go ahead.
I'll stay here where it's safe.
Watch where you're going.
- Oh, you're kidding.
- Hey, would I kid you?
Why didn't you think of it before we left home?
An artery, you say?
From one of my dead lads?
Yes, sir.
- For transplanting into one of your live ones?
- Right.
Well, an incredible fuss for just a leg, isn't it?
- Sure you wouldn't like a splash?
-  Uh, no, thank you.
You know, my father lost both legs in the Great War.
Never missed them.
Said he lived years longer not having to tie his laces.
Sir, we're fighting the clock a little bit on this one.
- If you'd just sign this release.
- Oh, yes, yes.
Let me see it.
Oh, the shelling stopped.
Well, all good things must come to an end.
Yes.
Quite.
Well, it all seems perfectly grisly and quite correct.
Thank you.
- A British artery in an American leg, eh?
- That's right.
Probably develop an irresistible urge to drive on the left side of the road.
Yes, quite.
- Get this to Major Houlihan.
Preparation for transplant.
- Yes, sir.
- Page Dr. Borelli to O.R. - Yes, sir.
- This stuff in supply.
Did you get it?
- Sure did.
I had a date with some nurse tonight.
Find out who and tell her I can't make it.
It was me.
- Radar, go get Borelli.
- Oh, right.
- I'm excited as hell about this.
- Take it easy, will you?
All we gotta do is assist.
Borelli's got the hard part.
Dr. Borelli, please report to the O.R.
Dr. Borelli, immediately.
- He's gonna love operating in our flea circus.
- As long as he saves the leg.
He will.
It all feels right.
Then we can escort him back to Tokyo.
I met the most fantastic girl there.
You've been holdin' out on me.
When?
Friday night.
I can't remember which bathtub.
Hawkeye?
- Where's Borelli?
- He's in the Swamp.
You'd better come.
Doctor?
The dance is starting.
We need you to stand your partner up.
Didn't you hear the page?
You're not fit to operate.
I know.
We'll just tell the patient that his doctor is soused.
Hope he doesn't mind walking around for the rest of his life on a tree trunk.
You can do it, Pierce.
I've watched you work.
You can do it better than I can.
I've never done it before.
I've never even seen it done.
I'll be right behind ya.
That'll be a great comfort.
- Cut it?
Okay.
- Yeah, go on.
Okay.
Now open the vascular clamp.
- It's leaking at the upper suture line.
- Put another stitch in.
Okay, cut it, hmm?
Okay.
Give it a tie.
Cut.
All right.
Try it again.
- Give it a cut.
- Wait a second.
- Okay.
- All right.
It's holding now.
Look at that bugger!
- Pulse is good.
Foot's getting pink and warming up.
-  Stick around, folks.
As an encore, I'm gonna sew Houlihan and Trapper together.
- Good work, Doctors.
- Thank you, Doctor.
They couldn't have done it better atJohns Hopkins.
- Wanna cut that?
- Mm-hmm.
Cut.
How 'bout some coffee?
I'd like to fill a swimmin' pool with it.
- I'll catch up with you later.
- Sure.
You did a good job, Doctor.
Somebody had to.
- I didn't drink at all in World War I. - Was liquor invented then?
In the Second War, I never drank until I was through working.
One for the road, Doc?
Or two or three?
Maybe you'd like to take a few home in a doggy bag.
Please don't confuse my explanation for an apology.
The place got to me.
I wanted to get into the game, but I'd forgotten how rough the game can be.
- Uh-huh.
- Didn't you ever have that problem?
Not to your degree.
What's that your leaning on, a bubble gum machine?
You have a great many gifts, Doctor.
It's a pity you can't number compassion among them.
I'm suffering from the three sure signs of age: Bit of a spread, gray hair feet of clay.
I wish you better luck on your third war.
- Colonel.
- Thanks for your help, Major.
- Major.
- It's a privilege, sir.
Trapper, I'll see ya in Tokyo sometime.
- I'll come to the lecture next time.
-  - Maybe you'll come back someday.
- Oh, it's been a real pleasure.
Oh, it's been our pleasure.
- Thanks for everything, Radar.
- You're welcome, sir.
Have a good trip.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Attention all personnel.
Corporal Stanley Salkowitz, acting camp librarian wishes to announce the delivery of 100 copies of Rumpelstiltskin.
- Another shipment of dirty books.
Clamp.
- Clamp.
Come on.
Points up!
Get with it, will you?
This kid's spleen is full of lead from a claymore.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
What the hell's wrong with you?
Three mistakes on one spleen.
- More suction.
- Right.
I'm just so nervous about Colonel Reese coming.
Oh, don't tell me.
What is he?
Another root canal wizard from Passaic?
It's a she.
A very important nurse.
The most decorated nurse in the army.
Great.
We can put our Christmas presents under her.
-  - Major, go roll some bandages.
Baker, take over here.
- Wait a minute!
- Come on.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
I'll see you later.
I smell nurse burning.
Mmm.
Give her a rabies shot before she bites somebody.
Give me a clamp.
Very good.
If you can't keep your mind on your job, Major ma'am, then stay out of the O.R. Major Burns, make him stop!
Pierce, as your superior officer, I order you to cease this harassing.
Watch your language, Frank.
You stay out of this, Keed.
I can't allow dirty language in front of Captain Pierce.
I promised his mother.
I know my job!
- I didn't get to be major by just sitting on my duff.
- Well, somebody did.
Just what did you mean by that?
I demand satisfaction.
Tired lately, Frank?
Major Burns, he has insulted me time and time again.
- Aren't you going to do anything?
- Well, like what?
Like something official or what?
Do something, Major.
My honor is in your hands.
Mclntyre, step aside.
Major Houlihan, I'm, uh, sorry you have to see this.
# Fools rush in where angels fear to tread ## - Get your dirty hands off me!
- Frank, I just washed them.
Captain Pierce, I accuse you of striking a superior officer.
A court-martial offense under the articles of war, and I have two witnesses.
- I didn't see anything.
Did you?
- My back was turned.
- Ba-dum-bump.
- Case dismissed.
I'm a witness!
Oh, Frank.
I better see a doctor.
Is there anybody who isn't mad at me?
Why don't you forget the whole thing?
I mean, it was just a little squabble.
He struck a superior officer.
Look, Frank, we're all a bundle of nerves.
Heck, I yell at Radar all the time.
I know you love me, sir.
I mean, the war's makin' us all buggy, Frank.
I've had my underwear on backwards for a month.
Come on.
Pierce will apologize.
Won't you, Pierce?
- I apologize.
- There you go.
That's a good Indian.
It's settled.
I'll see ya.
I gotta order glazed fruit for Christmas.
Apology refused.
I want him court-martialed!
Well Now, come on.
Let's just be buddies.
I'll tell you what.
Now, you can borrow my jeep go into town and see the cockfights.
- I can't stand to see a chicken cry.
- Court-martial.
Jiminy Crickets, Frank!
Do you know what has to be done to court-martial somebody?
I mean, the-the paperwork?
"Pending the completion of the preliminary investigation by the C. O the accused officer is relieved of duty and placed under house arrest".
He can't leave his tent.
You mean I just get to stay in and sleep and eat meals and read?
- Yes, sir.
- Take me.
I'm yours.
I surrender.
And I'll fight to the death any chance to set me free.
You think it's funny now, but what are you gonna do during your five years in Leavenworth?
I don't know.
Maybe I'll get married.
- Radar?
- Yes, sir?
Get out!
Colonel Reese, Major Houlihan.
They haven't lubed this clunker since Pershing was a pup.
Colonel Blake would have been here himself to greet you but he's involved with a court-martial and some glazed fruit.
Glazed fruit?
That'll tear your partial.
- I'll have an enlisted man get your bag.
- It's light.
All I got in here is fatigues, skivvies and an extra garter belt in case you guys have a dance.
- You'll be staying in my tent.
- Oh, fair enough.
M.P. S?
Is that where you keep the payroll?
Mission accomplished.
Take me home.
Oh, a stranger in town.
Don't talk to me.
I'm bad.
Pick me up at 8:00.
I'll be dining at Sardi's tonight.
What'll I wear?
What'll I wear?
See that my bathrobe is back from the cleaners in time.
- Pretty cute.
Who is he?
- Captain Pierce.
He's under house arrest awaiting court-martial.
Grabbed a nurse and jumped her bones, right?
- Oh, no.
- Pity.
Colonel Reese, Major Burns.
Uh, welcome to the MASH 4077 th, Colonel.
A little number three pancake will take care of that.
- That would be your bed there, ma'am.
- Oh, thank you.
Uh, Major Houlihan, can I see you outside?
Camp business.
Uh, for your ears only.
-  - Go ahead.
I wanna massage my gums.
Why does she have to bunk with you?
Because it's the only space in officers' country.
Well, how can we be alone?
We can't.
Margaret, I need our togetherness.
Without it, I'm desolate.
I miss our spiritual oneness, the blessed union of our souls.
And I'll break out.
- It'll only be for a few days.
- It'll be an eternity.
Be patient.
Write me a nice poem.
It's not the same.
My gums are singing!
Oh, I believe very strongly in oral hygiene.
Your gums are the best friends your teeth have.
- Now then, tell me about that doll.
- Ma'am?
The sheik who was just in here.
Major What's-his-name.
Uh, Burns.
- Married?
- In a way.
Uh-huh.
You and he playing doctor?
No!
Well, he's a very shy, serious uh, responsible person.
Listen, honey, take it from an old campaigner.
It's those dumb-lookin' quiet ones with the clenched teeth that really go.
# I'm back in the saddle again ## And then I said to everybody "Watch out for that bar of soap.
Look out for that bar of soap, everybody".
I specifically told Major Burns that a bar of soap on the floor can be very slippery.
- Frank says Pierce hit him.
- Oh, no, no, Henry.
When Frank fell on the soap, Hawkeye tried to break his fall.
By jamming his fist in Frank's eye?
- Radar, I lengthened your pants three inches.
- Not now.
- Why'd you want your pants three inches longer?
- Later!
- Okay, okay, but this is the last time I deliver.
-  Klinger.
It's 4:00 in the afternoon and you're still in a housecoat?
Put on a dress.
You never know who might be coming around.
Yes, sir.
Boy, oh, boy.
You gotta stay on top of these guys every second.
All right, go ahead, Mclntyre.
Now, you said you warned Frank about the Hey, why did you have your pants lengthened three inches?
They were chafing, sir.
I can let you have some baby powder.
I'd rather let my pants down, sir.
Hey, let's just wrap this up, huh?
All right, now how did Frank get the black eye?
- When he fell he hit the sink.
- "Whammo"!
- Right!
- Should I write "whammo," sir?
- Uh, no, no, it doesn't sound too G.I. Make it - "Socko".
Uh, no, no.
That's too Moon Mullins.
Make it "bam".
Okay, so Frank slipped, fell, hit the sink.
- That's my testimony.
- Okeydokey.
- "Okeydokey".
- No, strike the "okeydokey".
- Make it, uh, "very well".
- "Very well".
Frank, would you mind not combing your hair so loud?
I have very quiet hair.
And don't use that tone with me.
You're a prisoner of war.
And loving every minute of it.
I appreciate your falling down on that bar of soap and making everybody believe I hit you.
You still don't realize that you're under house arrest.
That you're not a free man.
Now, watch this.
I can step out.
I can step in.
Out.
In.
Out.
In.
- That's a free man!
- Very good.
Now let's see you go to Tahiti for the leprosy festival.
- Well, what did you have for dinner, Mclntyre?
- Hash.
- With a poached egg?
- That or an eye was looking out of it.
That kind of talk tightens my colon.
Ta-da!
- Steak?
- Mm-hmm.
Real steak?
You know my views on cannibalism.
Mess Sergeant Gifford fixed it for you when he heard you belted Frank.
- Where'd he get it?
- It's water buffalo.
It's probably as tough as a rubber sheet.
No, no.
A little old lady rode it to church every Sunday.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Now that's what I call church buffalo.
Try it.
- Mmm!
Mmm!
- Excuse me, Hawkeye.
- I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner.
- Sit down, Father.
- I'm here in an official capacity.
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that steak?
-  Mm-hmm!
I brought you a prisoner of war package.
Real steak?
Water buffalo.
And it's only got a hundred miles on it.
Try it.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Now that's delicious.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, my.
This is Friday.
No, it's Saturday.
We're over the date line.
Oh, dear.
That was close.
- Father, why?
- Oh.
According to the Geneva Convention, each prisoner is entitled to this package.
You have a razor, toothpaste, soap, six aspirin a wash cloth and four Oreo cookies.
Father, that's for a prisoner of war.
I'm one of ours.
In the eyes of the Lord, a prisoner's a prisoner.
Well, thanks.
And in your prayers, thank the big fella for me.
Oh, MacArthur had nothing to do with it.
Attention.
Due to last night's groping tomorrow night's movie will be shown with the lights on.
- What movie?
What's playing?
- Uh, a Gene Tierney picture I believe.
Oh, I love her overbite.
An overbite really gets to me.
- Gene Tierney, Harriet Mackey.
- Harriet Mackey?
Junior high.
Gene Tierney in a training bra.
I'd really like to see that movie, Father.
Let me work on it.
Father, you're the button in the cap of kindness.
The button - Can I use that?
- Be my guest.
-  - What's the matter?
I got a stomach ache.
I think you ate my meal too fast.
Well, you used to send it out by helicopter, for heck's sake.
Oh, yeah?
Well, this is Colonel Blake calling and I want that out here by 1300 hours!
And that's an order, Captain!
- Radar?
- Sir?
Since when have you been promoted to me?
Uh, well, uh me saying that I'm you is just like using your rubber stamp, only you can hear it.
Well, why the chewing out?
The mail's three hours late and I'm expecting something kind of special.
Radar, you still haven't finished your other glass pistol full of candy.
Now be a good little fella and relax.
You got 18 more months to wait for the mail.
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.
I'll be down at the new latrine.
Fr.
Mulcahy's blessing the lye.
"Be a good little fella".
"Be a good little fella".
I'll show 'em.
- Metzenbaum scissors.
- Metz.
See that, Major?
If you keep your straight scissors facing up your curved ones facing down, you'll never get them mixed up.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Little more 3O silk.
Sutures here, retractors there.
And army and navy goulet and ribbon.
And in this basin, the Richardson Balfour and diver.
You see, the idea is to develop a working rhythm with your surgeon.
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm.
Done.
Here, would you put a dressing on that, Major?
- Yes, Doctor.
- Bravo!
Bravissimo.
You got your own place or do you live with your folks?
-  -  I have no interest in hiring  You can hire me.
-  Sit down!
-  You're in the picture.
-  I'm terribly sorry.
-  That's all right.
I can't get the fly swatter out of the soup.
- Are they married?
- Hey!
Sit down.
Gwen, sit down.
Captain Pierce!
- I'm clean.
- Sorry.
I was reaching for my hanky.
- Hey, more popcorn, everybody.
Who wants popcorn?
-  Popcorn!
Hey, is it hot?
- There you go.
- Huh?
Sit down, Mclntyre!
I've lost the story.
Who's this guy?
-  Vincent Price.
- I don't understand it, Ellen.
- Boo!
-  Here, here.
Don't judge him too harshly.
After all, the other chap was coveting his neighbor's wife.
Father Hollywood.
Drink up, for tomorrow we die.
If I drink too much I'll get hot flashes.
We'll take pictures.
Will you marry me?
Why, you unpredictable little  What, what, what, what?
Cornel Wilde just kissed Gene Tierney.
- On the teeth?
- Right smack on.
If he straightens out that overbite, I'll kill him.
And I'll never let you go.
Never, never, never.
- Hey, hot dogs!
Red hots!
-  - Get your hot dogs right here!
Hot dogs!
-  Just reaching for my frankfurter.
This will make you feel a lot better.
What's going on here?
A movie in my quarters?
Yes, sir.
Captain Pierce ain't allowed out.
There must be 50 people in there.
I need my tweezers.
I have a hair in my mole.
I'm sorry, sir.
This whole post is potty.
The man's a prisoner and he's treated like the Aga Khan.
Shh, shh, shh.
The wedding scene's about to begin.
- Well, I'm going to the C.O. - Yes, sir.
You've always made me.
You did tell me not to let him swim the lake unless you were with us, but - but we wanted to surprise you.
-  Danny was so happy.
He'd been doing so well.
He swam three-quarters -  - He's very deep.
"Congratulations, big guy.
Now you are taller than she is.
Oh, boy, they fit!
"O'Brien and Brophy's elevated shoes will bring you a new confidence "a better personality and real class.
But ha-ha, watch out for low branches".
This is it, Klinger.
- Wow!
- Hey, look at you!
I'm a real person.
No, let me try it solo.
- Easy.
- It's all right.
Corporal, I wanna see Colonel Blake.
- He's at the movie right now, sir.
- Oh, "nerts".
What have you done to yourself?
Sir?
Well, you look different.
You changed the part in your hair.
- Uh, no, sir.
- Hmm.
New glasses.
That's it.
Well, they give you a look of authority, Corporal.
Dignity.
Oh, well, thank you, sir.
Did you hear that?
No more "little guy".
"Authority.
Dignity".
Wait a minute.
Look out!
Oh, um, I was looking for Major Houlihan.
She's in post-op.
Come on in, Major.
I don't wanna bother you.
I see you're doing your nails.
Just sharpening the old claws.
Never know when they might be useful.
Well, I'm rather upset.
Perhaps I'll take two aspirin and go lie down under a tree.
- I can see the tension.
Sit down, doll.
- Well, l Now, now, hon.
You tell the old colonel all about it.
- I'm, uh, cursed with perfection.
- Aw.
Even as a child, I always sorted my marbles according to size and degree of quality.
I had my "nibs," "aggies," "puries" and shooters.
- Sounds like a terrific kid.
-  I was a swell boy.
Pressed corduroy knickers, matching stocking and sweater set.
You're still so tidy and neat.
Oh, what is that?
Oh, my aftershave.
Rough and Ready.
- So masculine.
Gets right to me.
- Mm.
I, um I hear your marriage isn't all beer and skittles.
Oh, Louise.
She has no sense of order.
She's always getting into my drawer and mixing up my marbles.
Poor baby.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Rest stop.
How's the movie?
Captain Pierce.
- Radar, what's happened?
- Happened?
Yeah, either you've been raised or the camp's been lowered.
- Oh, Radar.
You don't need those.
-  Yeah, sure, go ahead.
I'll meet you inside.
Mention my name.
Why?
Listen.
You don't know what it's like being short.
I mean, always being the last one to be picked for the team.
Looking girls straight in the throat.
Never being able to see over the crowd.
Do you know that the only parade I've ever seen was one I was in?
Everybody's always making fun of me.
Even you.
Well, then I was out of line.
Listen.
There's height that people never see.
Some guys are ten feet tall, only their bodies don't know it.
- Honest?
-  Show time.
Show time.
Sell those to somebody little.
We waited, sir, then we went ahead without you.
It's gonna be so lonely.
Well, I'm not usually one for the hard stuff, Colonel.
This is just fruit juice, Major honey.
Just blackberry brandy.
Upsa-daisy now.
Down the old hatch.
Whoo.
That makes my feet tingle.
That'll put lead in your Eberhardt Faber.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
I mean, I hardly know you.
Now what's to know?
You're a man I'm a woman, trapped together in the ravages of war.
But we're officers!
Where do you think noncoms come from?
- The blood should run in over the next two hours.
- Yes, ma'am.
- I'm gonna put in some sack time.
- Okay.
Good night, ma'am.
Good night.
Oh, please.
We've just met.
You little fool.
Don't you know I can do things for you?
- Things?
- I hold the Pentagon in the palm of my hand.
How would you like stateside?
Would you like to play the Palace Walter Reed Hospital?
- Washington D.C.?
- Roger.
You could take care of the biggest people in the country senators, congressman.
G-men?
I can putJ.
Edgar Hoover's gallstones right in your pocket.
How does that strike you, Colonel Burns?
- Huh?
- Come on.
Pucker up.
Come on.
Colonel?
- Oh, well!
- Rape!
Rape!
- What?
- Rape!
- Rape!
Rape!
- Colonel Blake?
-  Yo?
- Somebody's hollering "rape".
Rape?
What a night.
A movie and vaudeville.
I didn't do anything!
We were drinking fruit juice talking about my marbles - J. Edgar Hoover's gallstones.
- What happened?
The man is a savage.
You mean he - Well, what do you want me to do about it, Colonel?
- File charges.
I don't want him sharing my house arrest.
You're innocent, Doctor.
He slipped on a bar of soap!
Margaret, l I never been to a rape before.
Maybe for your next birthday.
I'm gonna miss the movie!
All right, Burns, in my office.
Colonel, I have a few questions.
- Colonel!
- Put a hat on it.
Excuse me, sir.
- Much better, Radar.
- Thank you, sir.
C-rations.
You had steak.
Well, Frank, I was just a puncher.
You're a jumper.
This is terrible.
And what am I gonna tell my wife?
The truth is always the best, Frank.
You were waiting for your mistress and got impatient and attacked another woman.
You're a creep.
Yeah, but I'm free.
You're a prisoner.
I can go out.
I can go in.
Out.
In.
Out.
In.
In.
Out.
Out.
In.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
What is this?
Something and eggs.
The yellow stuff is the eggs.
This looks familiar.
I once cut that up in med school.
I know.
They're little Italian cigars.
I'll have mine after the theatre.
- I'll eat what you don't want.
- Your death wish is my command.
Two mounds of mashed potatoes for breakfast?
I think I used to go steady with that tray.
We could patent that, you know?
Potato falsies.
Foul mouths!
There is a lady present.
Well, where is there a lady present?
- Now there's a lady present.
- What's this morning's breakfast?
- Last night's dinner.
- Great.
That was yesterday's lunch.
Will you darn "foolskis" kindly cut the gabble-gabble?
- "Darn foolskis"?
-  Attention.
Officers'call will be held in Colonel Blake's office at 0700 hours.
- Is that A.D. Or B.C.?
- I don't know.
I was never sure about Henry.
Waitress, they're not paying their check!
Oh!
It was just another disgraceful display of the lack of discipline.
I don't think it's asking too much for officers to be military at breakfast.
I can't throw up and salute at the same time.
I see Private Carter has come down with carnal flu again.
- Get out of there!
- Yes, sir.
- Can we be of some service, Colonel?
- Got an emergency at the front.
You're at the wrong place, Radar.
The emergency's at the front.
- Radar, have you got that message from "l" Company command?
- I have that message, sir.
"'I' Company aid station sustained heavy shelling.
MASH 4077 to provide trained personnel until replacements arrive".
- That's it.
- That's it?
Did they enclose a check?
"L" Company's a cheap outfit.
Well, they could've sent something.
Their surgeon's been killed.
They need a new cutter, scrub nurse and a corpsman.
- That's all, huh?
- Look, this is a very dangerous mission.
I'm not gonna blow any sunshine up your skirts.
Any volunteers?
I'll go.
What about a surgeon?
Sure got quiet.
I don't want anything I say to be misinterpreted.
All right, fair is fair.
We'll draw straws.
- Uh, sir, no straws.
- Well, what have you got?
Um, sausage from breakfast.
I told you they weren't meant to be eaten.
Okay.
Whoever draws the short sausage volunteers.
Good luck Hawk.
I should be excused.
I'm single.
- I have the most kids.
- You're making a mockery of this!
I wouldn't make a mockery of drawing burnt sausages out of a bed pan to pick a volunteer for the Purple Heart.
Frank.
- I don't suppose there are three long sausages in there?
- No, sir.
Then I volunteer.
Hi, bunkie.
- Welcome aboard.
-  Okay, okay.
Now I gotta find someone to do the corpsman job.
I have the personnel cards right here, sir.
Just my luck, I'll get a lemon.
- I'll pick one.
- I don't trust you, Henry.
You always got something up your sleeve.
That's fine.
All right, Father, you pick one.
Uh, you do trust Father Mulcahy?
It says I should on all my money.
If you can't believe your money, who can you believe?
Well here we go.
Terrific.
I'm knocking my brains out to get sent home.
- This assignment will get me there in a box.
- Oh, no.
If I don't come back this pink strapless number should go to that big job the blond from Minneapolis.
Yeah, she'll keep it up.
She's built like a brick blockhouse.
Oh, my mink.
I got this for my interview with that shrink at H.Q. In Seoul.
- I came that close to a Section Eight discharge.
-  Then I saw the shrink's coat white fox, full-length.
He only wore it on leaves.
It's not easy when the doctors are nuttier than you are.
- Give it to Lieutenant Brown.
- Aw, come on.
- You're gonna come back.
You'll be all right.
- Write.
Tsk.
"Mink to Lieutenant Brown".
Ah, that's about it.
The rest isn't worth much.
Just to wear around the tent when you dust.
Are you scared?
Nah.
I'm from Toledo.
My mother was mugged bringing me home from the hospital.
- So long, buddy.
- Yeah, I'll see you soon, huh?
Sure you will.
- Hey, Klinger.
- Huh?
Uh, the Oh!
Of course.
Never in the afternoon.
You're making me nervous, Frank!
This is no time to make me nervous.
I know you're sorry you didn't volunteer, Frank.
I know you didn't volunteer because you're a married man.
It's practically monogrammed on your shorts.
And I know you can't leave your wife on account of the children.
That and the fact that everything is in her name.
Well, I'm a married man too, Frank married to the army.
I don't want the future you offer meeting behind garbage cans and behind laundry trucks.
When the war's over and nothing good lasts forever you'll go home, home to your wife's bony arms.
I'll still be in the service.
I'm an army brat, Frank.
My father was a colonel and my mother was a nurse, and I was conceived on maneuvers.
The army's in my blood.
I need its discipline, its traditions.
I thrill to the sight of a precise parade.
I could faint from looking down at my own brass.
That's why I volunteered, Frank to serve the army I love.
And don't you worry.
I'm coming back coming back to you for whatever time we have left together.
Because I'm not just Major Margaret Houlihan, army nurse.
I'm also Margaret Houlihan frail, vulnerable, sensitive female.
And if you touch one nurse while I'm gone, I'll cut your hands off!
- Listen, while I'm gone - Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
- Promise me you'll go out with other doctors.
- Yeah, right.
And when you come back, knock twice and give me five minutes.
And I expect to find all my after-shave.
I marked the bottle.
I need that stuff.
It's my secret weapon.
- You don't drink it?
- Are you crazy?
That'll kill ya.
I just gargle it.
- It must be rough up at the front, huh?
- It is in the movies.
There's a letter in my locker.
- Okay.
- It's my will.
Right.
I leave everything to the Benjamin Franklin Pierce Memorial Brothel.
I'll deliver it in person.
Shall we drink to Douglas MacArthur or Ish Kabibble?
I don't know.
They both mean so much to me.
No kidding.
Let's drink to something important.
To the Ritz Brothers.
Jeep's ready, Hawk.
Come back soon.
I hate to play solitaire alone.
- Flat tire, sir.
- Good thinking, Klinger.
- Watch for snipers.
- Yes, ma'am.
Is this more clever than saying "I ran out of gas"?
I had to arrange an entire Korean War, but I finally got you alone, Margaret.
Yeah.
I'll have the tire changed in two shakes.
- You'll have it changed?
- Well, you're the surgeon.
We can't risk your hurting your hands.
I'm not gonna let a woman do that.
- Don't think of me as a woman.
- Don't stand in profile.
- This is so ungallant of me.
- Consider it an order.
You are under me.
Would t'were that it were.
-  - What?
- The least you could do is get out of the jeep.
- Oh.
Never let it be said I didn't do the least I could do.
You'd never know this is an aid station.
Our red cross got blown off with the roof.
I finally make a house call, and the house is gone.
Klinger, come on.
-  - Pierce.
Dever.
- Dever, you wanna start that man on plasma right away.
- Dennis.
I'll do the initial triage out here, and then, once I start operating you and you will have to take care of it, all right?
- Find someplace for this man to lie down, will you?
- Don.
All right, we'll make this our sterile area.
Margaret.
We'll operate right on the litter.
They're about as sterile as anything we've got.
Put 'em up on these sawhorses here.
Klinger, prep the casualties over there.
Get a table or a box or something to put the instruments on.
- Yes, sir.
- All right, we're in business.
When you're all through, we'll print the invitations.
- Yes, sir.
- Margaret - Yeah, get some of those and pour a lot of alcohol into them.
- Right.
This is Grumpy calling Snow White.
Grumpy calling Snow White.
Come in, Snow White.
This is Snow White.
How you doing, Klinger?
Ah, we're setting things up.
- Is it terrible?
-  - It'll take a little work before it's only terrible.
-  - What was that?
- I hope it was just another flat tire.
They're shelling us with live shells.
Exploding, live shells.
This is Grumpy signing off.
Uh, Sn-Snow White, over and out.
Good luck, Grumpy.
- What's his blood pressure?
- 110 over 80.
- Beautiful.
Keep him under.
I'm almost done here.
-  Margaret!
Tape this up.
Try to keep the dust off him.
Neatness counts.
Got a table for one here.
Right down front.
He can see the whole floor show.
Okay, he's done.
Corpsman.
I'm afraid to move this one.
Start-Start some plasma on him.
He'll hold.
Doctor, I need you!
- Klinger.
Wash up.
- Sir!
Give me some more clamps, will ya?
Come on over here.
I need some pressure on a bleeder here.
Come on.
Damn Stalin.
Truman.
Whoever.
Come on, Nurse, get with it.
Don't you see we need heavier silk?
Frank, you're just sewing up an incision, not tying up the Queen Mary.
Oh, go mind your own beeswax.
- Go ahead, Henry.
I'll finish up here.
- Any news from the aid station?
Not yet.
Frank, you got enough rope here for the last roundup.
Well, then you do it sir.
It's unfair, making a surgeon work under these conditions.
Okay, put more pressure on it.
- All right, that ought to hold him.
- Thank you, Doctor.
You'll be okay.
He's the best.
How's the blood pressure now?
They keep knocking the needle around.
You can start without me, Margaret.
I never cut a man open before.
I'm not a surgeon.
That never stopped me.
Assist the major.
Yes, sir.
How come they don't get tired?
You gotta irrigate the wound first.
- It's difficult.
- You may have to open the wound more.
You can do it.
Why should I have all the fun?
Are they getting closer?
It's an optical illusion.
You can't tell me they'd kill a medical person on a mission of mercy.
They've already killed one surgeon here.
I told you, you can't tell me that.
More casualties coming in!
Colonel Blake, I insist that you order Mclntyre to stop harassing me.
It's tough enough doing surgery under these primitive conditions.
Surgery?
You medical moron.
You couldn't cut a salami without bungling it.
- Oh, yeah?
- That's enough from both of you.
- He started it!
- Frank, I swear I'm gonna put it in your record you don't work and play well with others.
##  That's enough, Frank.
Fourteen choruses of"God Bless America" is enough.
- Slacker.
- What?
- I don't chew my cabbage twice.
-  - Who is it?
- Another one of your gang.
Uh, it's me, sir.
- Choppers, Radar?
- Uh, no, sir.
Um, sir, I'm not feeling too hot.
Maybe it's everything you ate.
No, sir.
Um, the thing of it is I'm, uh I'm lonely.
It's so quiet and everything.
It's okay, Radar.
You can sleep in Hawkeye's bunk.
- Really?
- This is an officers' tent!
- Try to snore importantly, Radar.
- Yes, sir.
And remember, Hawkeye would be very upset if you had an accident in there.
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Is that it?
You're not going to tuck him in?
No bedtime story?
Radar, do you want me to tuck you in and tell you a bedtime story?
- No, sir.
- That's it, Frank.
- Then I'll turn this out.
- Sir, uh, do you have a night-light?
Hi, guys.
Sorry, Henry.
You can't check in without baggage.
-  Anything we can do for you?
- No, no.
I just stopped in for a nightcap.
I ran out.
In a few hours, that'll be gin.
- Who's sleeping in that bed?
- Goldilocks.
Her number came up.
- It's me, sir.
- Oh.
What are you doing here?
Captain Mclntyre promoted him.
Frank, it's after 6:00.
You can stop being snotty.
- Good night, Radar.
- Good night, sir.
Nobody went to the movie.
It's, uh, Sherlock Holmes.
The butler did it.
Aw, I was gonna see that tomorrow night.
I was kidding, Frank.
The maid did it.
Good movie.
It sure is quiet.
Guess you guys wanna go to sleep, huh?
-  Henry?
- Yo?
They're okay.
- Yeah, sure.
- Are you worried about them?
I sent them, remember, Frank?
Their commanding officer?
Back home, my biggest decisions are whether or not to have my own bowling ball made and do I get the cat fixed.
Sending people to the front's just not my speed.
Would you like another can?
No, thanks.
I ate before I left America.
Klinger's asleep.
Yeah, he collapsed about an hour ago.
Time flies when you're having fun.
- He did good work.
- He's a credit to his bloomers.
May I clear the table?
Some dessert?
Would you like to see the pastry tank?
We have some military favorites: Napoleonic War, Pie Alamo, Caramel Custer.
No, thanks.
We did it.
My lips are sealed.
Do you suppose there are snipers out there?
If they're good union snipers, they are.
I want you to know, chivalry isn't dead.
It's just been replaced by exhaustion.
Good night, Captain.
Good night, Major.
- Radar?
- Sir?
Oh.
Sir, they're on their way back.
- Really?
- Yes, sir.
Klinger just called and, uh, the replacements have arrived and they're safe and they're okay and they're safe and everything.
- I gotta have a drink.
- Yes, sir.
- You drank it all.
- Radar, do you believe me?
I never have, sir.
Uh, you better tell Captain Mclntyre and Major Burns.
You know, some people are just born to take charge.
You know what I mean, Radar?
Yeah, I guess he knows what I mean.
Well, there it is.
We made it back to the fort, Emmy Lou.
I never thought I'd be happy to see that upholstered toilet again.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Major, I gotta tell you something.
But if you repeat this to anyone, I'll deny it.
You are my favorite officer in the whole U.S. Army.
Same goes for me, Major.
You're aces.
Thank you, Corporal, Doctor.
I always go for the popcorn when it gets to the mushy part.
Right.
Okay.
Ready for the army again.
# Over hill, over dale # #We will hit the dusty trail # #As those caissons go rolling along # ##  #As those caissons go rolling along # # For it's hi, hi, hee in the hoo-hoo, ha-ha hee # # Shout out your numbers loud and strong ## Cold and noisy.
Those shells make a lot of noise.
I don't know how the guys in the war movies can take it.
I know.
Right.
- But how was it?
- It was rough.
Klinger worked so hard, he got a run in his legs.
But, uh, how was the major?
Pretty damn good.
You fink.
Start from the top.
- Oh, no, nothing like that.
- But you just said She worked like a trooper above and beyond the call.
Boy, your mind is in the gutter.
I can't help it.
It's attached to my body.
Come on, will ya?
A man and a woman can have a constructive relationship that's based on mutual respect.
- Of course.
- You!
Oh, I just love that.
"Dr. Pierce and I performed like a well-oiled machine under very difficult circumstances.
It was an exhilarating experience".
And I don't exhilarate you, I suppose?
You're not the easiest woman in the world to exhilarate, let me tell you that, Margaret.
I mean I mean, I don't want that to sound like it means what it sounds like.
I was just so jealous.
I missed you so.
I slept with one of your boots under my pillow.
Honest.
Really.
I wrote you the longest love letter of my life.
It takes up almost a whole roll of toilet paper.
Oh, Margaret.
- Margaret, you're back.
- I have a headache, Frank.
I knew it.
I knew it!
"Well-oiled machine".
Where is everything?
I said give it away in case l you know.
- Yeah, I know, but - The green neg was my favorite.
- I was gonna wear it for dinner my first night back.
- Well, I tried, but You guys at the rear have no respect for the front-line troops stealing our dresses.
I just wish I could make out what it was I was eating.
All it needs is a little salt.
And pepper.
Mustard, catsup, sauce, flavor.
And, of course, the coffee's cold again.
It's getting better.
It's less purple.
Oh, this camp is impossible.
I don't believe the conditions we're expected to put up with.
I mean, really.
I know there's a war going on, but we can't be treated like animals.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
-  Metzenbaum.
- Anytime, Frank.
- Quiet.
- Well, just do something before the patient dies of boredom.
If Kwang were half an assistant, he'd have the instruments in my hands without my thinking.
What's that for?
Oh, right.
- Can I be of any help?
- Careful, Father, he'll cut right through your beads.
I don't need this abuse!
- We do.
- Hey, come on, people.
Just once, huh?
Well, thank the stars someday this'll all be over, and I can go home and hang up my shingle.
"Frank Burns Exterminator".
- Colonel!
- Mclntyre.
- Pierce!
-  Colonel!
- Richardson.
-  - See what you've done?
- Sorry, Doctor.
-  I'll get it.
-  Now, that is the work of a bungling incompetent.
- Don't be so hard on yourself, Frank.
- Stay out of this, buttinski!
- Now what?
- Between this inept orderly and the backbiting in here I did not bite his back, but I did pinch his tushy.
- Sorry, Father.
- What exactly is a tushy?
I cannot work in this madhouse!
- Find us a sane war somewhere, Frank.
- Get us two seats down front.
It's the same thing every time in the O.R. With those two boobs - tensions, insults, bickering.
- Frank, I don't know why you let them bother you.
- You know you're a good surgeon.
- Of course I know I'm a terrific surgeon.
- Who said "terrific"?
I said "fair".
- You said "good".
- I think all you docs are doing a great job.
- Oh, thanks, McShane but saving lives that's all in a day's work.
Well, let's all have a slice of humble pie.
Doctor, I hope my clumsiness in no way interfered with your performance today.
Hey, you express yourself real good, Mr. Kwang.
Oh, you can bet he memorized that speech.
Can't you tell, Frank?
I'm a ventriloquist.
- Try it again.
I think your lips moved.
- An apology is not enough.
- You're going to have to shape up around here.
- Or we won't save your country.
Come on, Frank.
Get off his back.
He does good work.
Why do you reserve all your praise for them?
How come you never have a "good job" to a clean-cut boy like McShane here?
- Good job, clean-cut boy.
-  Take two Norman Rockwells out of petty cash.
Oh, thank you.
Thank God Henry runs the hospital.
The war'd be no fun without him.
Makes you glad he mugged that med student and stole the diploma.
Oh, Mr. Kwang.
Why don't you join us for the happy hour?
- Thank you, sir.
- Hope you like martinis.
We've got some new Beefeater's formaldehyde.
I'll play bartender.
Oh, that's nice.
He has a cleanliness fetish.
- Mr. Kwang?
- Thank you, Doctor.
First of all, we'd like to apologize for Frank Burns on behalf of the United States.
As well as Canada and Mexico.
Please don't let him bother you.
He's harmless, unless you're under his care.
He's under a lot of tension.
Unlike the rest of us, who are just over here to put on The Student Prince.
You know, your command of our language is really very impressive.
- Thank you, sir.
- You must have studied somewhere.
You certainly can't learn English from Americans.
I was a student at the University of Seoul when the war broke out.
So much for school.
Walking there one day, two soldiers jumped out of a truck and threw me into the back.
At that moment, I realized I'd volunteered.
Yeah, we've heard a lot about those draft board trucks.
They get about 22 recruits to the gallon.
Eliminates the suspense of wondering if you can pass the physical.
Fortunately, I was sent to the 121 st hospital where a medical officer felt I had surgical aptitude.
I'm very grateful to him.
Well, let's face it: Medical officers are sweethearts.
I welcomed the transfer here since your reputation as skillful surgeons is well-known.
Somebody's reading those leaflets we dropped.
- Tip-see-dah.
- Shalom.
Also.
I have only one regret in being sent here.
What is it?
We're publishing a catalogue.
When I was drafted I did not have chance to say good-bye to my wife.
I have not seen her since.
Well, that's no sweat.
We'll get you a three-day pass.
I've tried.
They said impossible.
Naturally.
Every unit is assigned an impossible officer.
Leave it to us, Mr. Kwang.
Attention.
All doctors assigned to premarital exams please report for duty.
Ah.
I hear the Korean love call.
Doctor, thank you very much.
- A pass just takes a lot of ingenuity.
- And a little of forgery.
- One for the road?
- I better not.
It takes a steady hand for a Wasserman.
- In a minute, Mother.
In a minute.
- Sign this, sir.
- Everything seems to be okay here, Sergeant.
- Ditto here too.
Just take this over to the colonel, and he'll sign your adoption papers.
- I'm not going to adopt her, Doc.
She's going to be my bride.
- She'll make a charming wife.
And you can get her into the movies for half price.
Over here.
- You got any three-day passes on you?
- I don't want to get in Dutch.
You wanna see any more books on reproduction?
Wait here.
We are not giving away teeth.
No teeth today.
- Just sign there, sir.
- Well You're not getting married, are you, Radar?
Uh, not to my knowledge, sir.
Well, then, can't it wait?
I've got so many things to sign, I don't know what I'm signing.
Yes, sir.
- Top secret, sir.
- Oh?
Well, what is it?
Well, I'm not supposed to know, but you must know - otherwise they wouldn't want you to sign it.
- Right.
So if you'll just sign below my hand, I'll just close my eyes and Gotcha.
- Okay.
- Thank you, sir.
Oh, Radar, will you get the keys to the teeth?
- Yes, sir teeth.
- Gonna get you some teeth.
Get the keys, then the teeth.
- One three-day pass.
- Bless your little belly button.
Keys for the teeth.
- Ready for the next?
- Okay, Father.
- Uh, hi, Docs.
- McShane.
Yeah, I, uh, came for a physical.
I'd like to get married.
Does Judge Hardy know about this?
- You interested in a local girl?
- Yes, sir.
Soong Hi.
Uh-huh.
Uh, look, we'll be right with you, okay?
Just a minute.
- Haven't we seen her somewhere before?
- Yeah, at Rosie's Bar.
She's been on that same stool through two wars, with a change maker in her purse.
Um uh, would you, uh, just, uh - Wait over here for us.
We'll be just a minute.
- And, Private, could we Will you four lovely people just come along with me?
- Where did you meet this woman?
- She's hardly a woman, sir.
- She's only 21 years old.
-  - Her mascara's older than that.
- Sir?
Sorry.
Look, kid when you're this far away from home, your perspective gets a little out of whack - you start to lose your objectivity.
- And she gets your P.X. Card.
Oh, no, no.
It's not like that, sir.
We really love each other.
- You written home about this?
- No, sir.
When you walk into the house together, your mother's gonna fall into her apple pie.
While it's still in the oven.
You know that I don't have to ask for your permission, only a physical.
Look, kid, it's rough over here for all of us fetid water, Civil War leftovers.
I personally know three bedbugs by their first names, but that's not gonna go on forever.
Yeah.
Why can't you just wait for a couple of months or so?
- Why?
- Call it a cooling-off period.
But I don't want to cool off.
I want to get married, now.
Couple of months isn't very long for two people who are really in love.
Mmm.
- All right.
I'll wait.
- Good.
- But just two weeks.
- Okay.
Two weeks.
Right.
That'll make the gang at the malt shop very happy.
Radar, if you're gonna eat pickles, don't touch the cards.
Even when I get a good hand, it stinks.
- I open for a half.
- I'm in.
- Me too.
All right.
I'll see you, and I'll raise you - Where's my other chip?
- Well, don't look at me.
What you want to search us?
- Radar?
- Yeah?
- You ate my chip.
- I did?
Probably the only digestible thing he's had all night.
Is it possible?
Captain, are you in or out?
All right.
I'll raise you a half, and I'm shy one chip that Radar ate.
And if you don't believe me, I'll have him x-rayed.
- You in?
Call.
- Oh, yeah.
- In.
- Call.
- What do you want, Radar?
Um, three cards.
- And a glass of mineral oil.
Gimme three.
- Uh-huh.
- I'm pat.
- Gimme one.
Dealer takes one.
- Okay, you're the raiser.
What do you say?
- Uh, check.
- Check.
- I bet a buck.
- Call.
- I'm shy four.
- A buck?
- El fold-o.
- Two pair bullets and jacks.
- Ha-ha!
- Flush!
-  Henry they're all the same color, too bad they're not the same suit.
Two, three, four hearts, and a diamond.
I gotta get some R and R. Three treys, or trey threes, if you like.
- The rich get richer.
- The soul of grace.
Why do the officers win the big pots when they got everything else goin' for 'em?
Don't give me any of that poor G.I. Crapola, Zale.
You mailed home three jeeps and two-thirds of a truck.
You're not doing that, are you?
I know in my next life I'd want to be an officer.
I had you down for pussycat.
It's not just the money.
You officers live better, you eat better then there's the nurses.
You think we like playing around with the nurses?
We have to.
It's part of their recruiting program.
If there was one of those big-mouth sergeants here, he'd say "Blow it out your stethoscope sir".
Some enlisted men aren't even allowed to fall in love.
- Jacks are better.
- They can fall in love with anybody they want as long as it's another enlisted man.
- Danny McShane's in love.
- Aha.
Radar, we're trying to do him a favor.
McShane's a lonely kid a long way from home.
- He's all mixed up.
-  Oh?
Did you ever see him lay down a flush with four hearts and a diamond?
Open for a buck.
Don't make it sound like we're breaking up Donald O'Connor and Peggy Ryan.
- That woman's got a lot of miles on her clock.
- But it's his decision, sir.
Maybe we should butt out.
So what if she only wants to take him?
Look, on a cold night in Korea with the wind blowing in off Siberia you can't get warm shackin' up with your P.X. Card, you know.
You got a touch of the poet in you, Zale.
-  - Hear that?
- Sounds like a fight.
Don't tell me you've got a pass.
I want to see it.
- Probably another attempt on the cook's life.
Come on.
- Let's go.
Come on, come on.
You will find it has been duly and properly authorized by the commanding officer.
Oh, shut up.
I heard enough of your pidgin English.
This is a forgery, fella.
- Where do you think you're going?
Stop that man!
- Gimme three cards.
- Shouldn't somebody see what's happening?
- Maybe one of you officers - ought to rush out there and make a decision.
-  - That sounded like a shot fired in anger.
- Radar, go take a look.
- Me, sir?
- Now's your chance for that next life.
- Colonel Blake - Yo.
- Did you authorize this pass for that Korean national?
- Hey!
- Put away that gun, Frank.
- Which one?
- The one who fakes English so literate, Mr. Kwang.
- I didn't give him a pass.
- I thought as much.
- Hey, can we play cards?
- It has my signature.
- I knew it was a forgery!
- Yes, sir, that is your signature.
- It is?
See the fat "K" and the skinny "A"?
I'd know your "A-K" anywhere, sir.
I caught him climbing into a truck, and when I saw the fake pass I ordered him down, but he's run off.
- Now, you can charge him with desertion.
- Let me bet first.
- Is that why we heard a shot?
- Well, I fired a warning, but he just kept running.
Frank, put that gun down.
It's as offensive a weapon as your mouth.
Okay, scaredy-cat, but I can handle a firearm with the best of them.
- Sirs?
- That's us.
- Someone in your tent to see you sirs.
- Male or female?
- Uh, male.
- Well, you can't win them all.
Sir, could I have that book now?
I got an hour off, and I got I got an hour off My luck is still lousy.
Look who's here.
- Gentlemen.
- Dr. Pak, isn't it?
I'm flattered you remember me, sir.
I recognized the dirt under your nails.
Still doing those phony operations with the fake stitches?
And using hair cream for penicillin?
I examined one of your patients, Doctor.
He still had pneumonia, but I must say you cleared up his dandruff.
If you are finished, sirs I would like to make you a proposition.
In conjunction with my medical practice, I am in a new business.
Headstones?
I understand you are trying to prevent the marriage of Private McShane and a Miss Soong Hi.
- What's it to you?
- I am prepared to offer each of you $250 - if you okay her physical.
- Just what business are you in?
Marriage broker.
I arrange matches between Korean girls and G.I. S to enable the girls to go to your wonderful stateside.
Ah.
Where they, uh Work for some friends of mine.
Uh-huh.
Night work.
In the future, I assure you more money but Private McShane insisted on a thousand dollars for himself.
This marriage was made just a few feet lower than in heaven.
Clean-cut American boy.
Those freckles must be pasties.
- You know, sir, you might just go down in medical history.
- How's that?
As the first doctor to set two broken legs, and both of them his own.
- Come back!
- Hey!
Hey!
Mr. Kwang.
You know you're up on desertion charges?
- I was trying to get to my village.
- Who isn't?
I received word from my wife.
She is about to give birth to our first child.
- Well, why didn't you tell us?
- C.O.'s this way, fellas.
- You wait outside.
We'll do the talking.
- I'm going to be a father!
Good.
You can pass out cigars to the firing squad.
Henry, you can't charge a man with desertion if he had a pass signed by you.
You can't call it forgery it's got your signature on it.
A person can't forge his own name.
- Radar, let me see the pass again.
Thank you.
- Here's the pass again, sir.
I just don't remember signing this.
Well, who's to blame if you have amnesia?
Aw, don't give me that amnesia bit.
I remember seeing this last night at the poker game.
What poker game?
- Radar, didn't we play poker last night?
- If you say so, sir.
Oh, I get it.
You're trying to gaslight me, right?
- Come on, Henry, let him go.
- No!
It's not that easy!
I mean, I got people writing reports on me all the time.
Every move I make is watched.
Hi, Frank.
What are you doin'?
Security.
Just checking the lock.
- With your ear?
- Get out, Frank.
- Well, I never meant to come in.
- Henry - Henry, this is an emergency.
- Mr. Kwang's wife is having a baby.
- Her first.
- What makes it really exciting is Mr. Kwang's the father.
- Uh-huh.
- Aw, gee, sir, it sure would be swell if we could get this Korean mommy and daddy with their baby all together in the same place.
Will you cut it out?
All right.
He can't have the pass, but I will drop the charges.
Henry, that's very decent of you.
Would you like to try for human?
- What about Mr. Kwang's wife can't we do something for her?
- Hey, there's a war on, remember?
Most of these women have to have their babies in a rice paddy and then go back to work.
- Henry, we all saw The Good Earth.
- Hey, what is that?
- A 20-year-old movie.
- We're getting that next week.
Hey, I would like to give Mr. Kwang a pass, but there'd be hell to pay at H.Q. - All right, then Radar and I will go.
- Where?
To pick up Mrs. Kwang so she can have her baby here.
Oh, fine, fine.
That's all we need, is a baby.
- Come on.
- You know, we don't have any diapers around here or anything.
- Can we borrow some of your shorts?
- Okay.
The village is Quang Sun, east 10 miles of the main road.
- Pretty close to enemy lines.
- Quite so, Doctor.
Hey, wait a minute.
How close is it to the Chinese?
I don't want to scare you, but the grocery stores are stocking up on fortune cookies.
Ha-ha, sir.
How do you wish me good luck in Korean?
Doctor  I thought so.
-  - ##  Come in.
- You sent for me, Doc?
- Ah, yeah, McShane.
Come on in.
Sit down.
##  I just wanted to congratulate you on your upcoming wedding.
Thank you, sir.
I heard that you and Captain Pierce had given Soong Hi her physical.
- I sure appreciate that, sir.
- I imagine you're gonna have quite a honeymoon.
Well, I'm trying to scrape up enough money to go to Tokyo, sir.
- Well, you can go further than that on a thousand bucks.
- Sir?
Now, don't play Huck Finn with me, kid.
Dr. Pak told us all about the racket.
I don't know any Dr. Pak, sir.
The doctor with the Parker Brothers diploma.
He gives you a thousand clams to marry Broadway Rose East then, after the ceremony, you two part company.
She goes to work for Pak's friends in the States at the corner of 42nd and somewhere.
- You run to the post office for a money order.
- Really, sir You give me one more "sir," and I'm going to prescribe a 24-hour enema.
Okay, okay.
Listen, why shouldn't an enlisted man get in on the gravy?
Everybody else is making a buck over here.
Why shouldn't I?
-  - Yeah?
- Radiology, Doc.
- Thanks.
Don't sweat it, Captain.
Call the thousand dollars the bride's dowry an old Korean tradition.
Hey, boy next door.
There's another old Korean tradition - it's called tuberculosis.
- What?
I'm afraid there's a shadow on the lung of the former future Mrs. McShane.
Come on.
You're just saying that to blow my deal.
Your deal is blown.
Take a look.
Of course, at a thousand bucks a shot, I'm sure you'll be able to find true love again.
How long is the trip back to the base, sir?
About three hours.
- How long we been on the road?
- A little over 15 minutes.
- Now I'm sorry we weren't captured.
-  - You having pains?
- Yes, sir.
I was talking to Mrs. Kwang.
Ma'am?
Is it one long, steady pain, or do they come and go?
The pain comes, and the pain goes.
Mine's one long, steady one.
Uh-oh.
- Really?
- I think she's going into labor.
- What does that mean?
- It means she's about to give birth.
Right here?
On this bus?
In front of me?
Yeah, right here on this bus.
What do I do give her a transfer tell her to wait?
I need your help.
Can you get up, please?
Come back here, okay?
Take it easy.
Be careful.
Don't strain yourself.
- Gently.
- You can get up here.
- Easy.
I'm gonna lift you now.
Easy.
Oh!
- Watch your head.
Listen, maybe if we lift her feet up, it'll slow things up a little.
Go get my bag.
Where were you when they were teaching this in school?
I must have been out that year.
- I'm gonna need your help.
- But I'm no good at delivering babies!
When the cat had kittens, they sent me to the movies!
- Radar, there's nothing to it.
It's a natural experience.
- So is fainting!
-  -  Don't worry.
You'll be all right.
Um, shouldn't I get some hot water or something?
- There's no time for that.
- I'd be very glad to get out and look for some.
- Maybe there's a hot river near here, like at Yellowstone.
- Radar!
Come on, I need your help.
Just hold her hand.
She and I'll do the rest.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
- You'll be all right.
- Oh, sure, easy for you.
Oh, don't do that!
-  -  Oh, my God!
It's a boy, Mr. Kwang.
He and his mother are doing fine.
I cannot thank you enough, Doctor.
- Tough delivery?
- Fortunately, I brought along a specialist.
That is one cute little fella.
- Thank you.
- Isn't he somethin'?
"Radar Benjamin Franklin TrapperJohn Henry Kwang".
- Radar, you got top billing.
- For giving me the pass.
- For giving you Radar.
- He didn't mean what he meant, sir.
- I want you to sign my name.
I want you to sign my name.
- Uh, sir, I have something - Sir, I never signed - Hey, hey - Hey, hold it.
- This is a hospital!
- I know.
I come here all the time.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
Haven't you seen me here?
- Yeah, the doctor in Ward "C"?
- Yes, I did that wonderful appendectomy
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Well, he's operating right now, sir.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir, if you say so, sir.
Yes, sir!
I'll do that right now!
Sir.
Clamp.
This guy has the right idea.
Write a book on traumatic surgery and then when a war breaks out, the book gets drafted and he stays home.
- Sponge.
- Hello, Frank.
How are you?
Pretty big talk!
Pierce, using a textbook?
Orthopedic case.
Dummkopf!
All right, let's put him under, shall we?
Watch this.
Need some help, Pierce?
No, thanks.
I'd rather save the patient.
That got him.
Unless they taught you something special at Vivisection State Teachers' College.
-  - Which I doubt.
- Here we go!
- You better quit while you're behind, Frank.
I've been a practicing surgeon for 12 years!
When do you think you'll be ready to operate?
Just an estimate, Frank.
Frank, I begged you to quit.
Give me a four-by-four.
- And another thing!
- Frank, they'll kill you.
- Colonel?
- Yo.
There's a very important phone call on the phone for you, sir.
Have the call switched.
I'll take it inside this gallbladder.
- Metzenbaum scissors.
- Sir?
Sir.
- Radar, you must be kidding!
- Cross my heart.
Moist lap sponges, please.
Spalding, finish up for me, please.
- What's up, Henry?
- I'll tell you later.
You were finally toilet trained, right?
Yes, sir.
Yes, indeed, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
What's What's that, sir?
Uh, the 19th, Colonel?
The 19th.
Uh, let me see.
The 19th would That would be between the uh, the 18th and the 20th if I'm any judge of 19ths.
Yes, sir.
Uh, yes, sir.
We'll be ready.
Oh, and, Colonel, let me just add that this is an honor that thrills me right down to my toenails.
Well, yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Good day, sir.
He's coming here.
- Him, here.
General Douglas MacArth -  The head man.
The chief cheese is coming here.
Him?
Here?
Here.
Yes.
The big monk.
- The biggest, highest monkiest of them all.
- Wow!
They don't come any monkier.
Do you know why he's coming here?
Because we've got the most impressive damn record of any medical unit in Korea!
That's North, South, East or West.
- We're the MASH that is the best!
- Rah!
Rah!
Colonel Whiteman, his administrative aide?
- He'll be here on Wednesday to brief us.
- Oh, wow!
Radar, this is the biggest thing that's ever happened to me since I did my first strangulated hernia.
Radar, the publicity!
The publicity!
I mean, every move Big Mac makes is news!
- When he goes to the latrine, they flash an AP/UP bulletin.
- Really?
And the Daily Bloomington Pantagraph.
Oh, boy, I can just see it.
"Supreme Commander Inspects Local Doctor," in type about yea big.
- You'll be famous, sir.
- Yeah.
Yeah, and let me tell you something, little friend.
My price for a tonsillectomy - just went from 50 to 75 bucks a tonse.
- Right!
Yes, sir.
They'll have to pay if they want the big man.
Colonel Blake's office?
Straight ahead, sir.
Can't miss it.
Thank you, uh, soldier.
Corporal Klinger, sir.
Sentry post number one.
Carry on.
Must be therapy for the mental cases.
And Colonel Whiteman, here, of General MacArthur's general staff has very kindly condescended to brief us all briefly on the general's impinging visit.
- Colonel.
- Thank you, Colonel.
I'm sure you must all be excited at the idea of meeting our supreme commander.
I'm thrilled beyond repair.
My bellybutton's been puckering and un-puckering all day.
A little charged up.
You know, heap big chief coming.
All right, let me clue you in schedule and briefing-wise.
- I'll roger that.
- Mclntyre.
The general will arrive at exactly 1155 hours and will enter the camp at this point.
I assume you will not, repeat, not have the same man on sentry duty.
- Klinger.
- Klinger?
Oh, no, sir.
Make a note no Klinger.
He just had his ears pierced.
The general's cavalcade will circle the compound, inspecting troops and then will stop here at point "B" at precisely 1158 hours.
The general will dismount at 1159 hours after a one-minute security inspection of the area by escort.
From 1200 to 1204 hours, the general will be welcomed by commanding officer.
- Maybe you can break the four-minute welcome, Henry.
- You'd better go into training.
Colonel Whiteman, I just want to say that this disrespectful attitude is in no way shared by myself or Major Burns on my right.
On your right what?
Included in the above said time allotment for commanding officer's greeting is the introduction of inferior grade officers.
That's gotta be us.
- Yes?
- I think the colonel might like to know that Major Houlihan's father was under General MacArthur in the cavalry.
Her father was a horse!
Did you know that?
Our engagement is off.
While the general is here, do not address him unless he first addresses you and then always use his full name and rank in reply as "Yes, General MacArthur".
"No, General MacArthur".
"Thank you, General MacArthur.
" - God Almighty.
- Close.
Very close.
Steady, men.
And now, lunch.
The eating thereof will be at 1300 hours.
The general eats the same food as that served to men in the field.
Does he like his ice cream on top of his beef stew like us?
Mess will terminate at 1410 hours when the general's pipe is lit.
Must be a squad that takes care of that.
We'll have the men on hand, Mclntyre.
Make a note, Radar.
Volunteers to light pipe.
Now then, after lunch And the barfing thereof.
To proceed.
The general's visit is a tribute to your unit's efficiency.
A demonstration of your function would be most apropos.
- We could do an operation for him.
- Pierce.
- Don't be a simp!
- We operate every day.
Perhaps the general would like to observe our surgeons at work.
Yeah, with a stitch-by-stitch commentary.
And for a big finish, a postop infection.
Has possibilities, Colonel.
That's just what I was thinking.
I mean, it'd be a real eye-popper.
- Colonel?
- Yes?
Um, as adjutant and assistant chief surgeon - I'd like to volunteer for that operation.
- How splendid, Major.
Very good, Frank.
- Lovely.
- Then it's agreed.
We'll do a hysterectomy on Major Burns.
Because we have the best record of any medical unit in Korea we have been bestowed upon by a great honor -  MacArthur's coming!
-   Yea.
Quiet.
Quiet down, folks.
Quiet!
- Does this mean Radar has to take a bath?
- I hope so.
We'll carry him to the river and beat him on a rock.
We've got very little time before the bestowment of this honor and this place is a shambles, so we've got to as quickly as possible uh, deshamble-ize.
Corporal.
"Duty rosters will be posted on the bulletin board.
No changes will be made.
"All leaves are canceled unless of hardship, emergency, or of like or similar nature.
"A death in the family is good, as always.
"All future announcements will be in vocal, oral "or written-down form, and in the case of the latter "accompanied by immediate superior's signature in three copies with two in my 'in' basket and one in my 'out".
' Company dismissed!
Klinger, I want to see you in my office this afternoon.
Yes, sir.
You can double-park your horse.
Colonel, I was thinking.
I might put together a little souvenir memorial album for the general.
- Frank.
- Hmm?
Caesar is coming to inspect us, not bury us.
Hey, that's pretty good, huh?
- Spalding.
- Colonel?
How 'bout writing one of your special songs for MacArthur?
Think you can come up with something nice on the ol' cucaracha there?
- I've been working on it, sir.
- Oh!
#Well, it's not Corrigidor You know it's only Korea # # It's a lousy little war But we'd still love to see ya # #And I'm sure we can scrounge up a beach # #And you can splash in and give us a speech # # With your corncob pipe # #And your five gold stars ## Well, it's catchy, but it's not "prezactly" what I had in mind.
- You're not the least bit clever.
- It's a big club, Frank.
Do it again.
What have we here?
A diminutive Diogenes?
Looking for two honest men, Radar?
Oh, thanks.
Hey, Trap.
Frank, what are you doing?
- Burning books.
- Oh.
Any special reason, Dr. Hitler?
One of the greatest living Americans is coming and I'm not going to let him see some of the trash that's read around here.
Plato's Republic?
The Life of Red Grange?
Revolutionaries.
- Right!
- Robinson Crusoe?
Everybody runs around half-naked.
- Norman Mailer.
- It's got that word in it.
Frank, you burn one more book, I'm gonna give you a dancing lesson in the mine field.
Now, knock it off, gnat-brain!
General of the Army, General Douglas MacArthur, your supreme commander is going to inspect you, fella!
Genuflect when you say that, pal.
And he's gonna find us just the way we are, and what we are draftee doctors, a little gamy and dazed from crawling inside people trying to keep them breathing.
Forget Fort Dix, Frank.
This is bedpan alley.
Okeydoke.
You slackers do what you want.
But I'm gonna show the general we're military!
And I order you to clean up the unholy mess in there, and if you don't, I will!
You touch one dirty sock, you remove one layer of crud you kill one cockroach, Frank, and I will personally grind you into a fine powder and sprinkle you on MacArthur's oatmeal!
What he said!
## ## Uh, Klinger, about that getup.
You don't like it?
Don't be afraid to tell me.
I can take criticism.
No, it's not the outfit, per se wise.
It's the pedicure.
A little naughty?
Klinger, the one thing that General MacArthur may not understand at a military hospital four miles from the front is a flower girl with a 5:00 shadow.
I just can't have you traipse around while his nibs is here.
Sir, you can't be serious.
This is my big chance to get out.
General MacArthur can discharge anybody!
Harry Truman if he wants.
No dice, fella.
Please, Colonel.
I won't smile at him or say I'm pregnant or anything.
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'll give you three days R and R in Tokyo.
You leave before Big Mac arrives.
- Okay?
- What good is that?
He'll be here and I'll be there.
It's either that or put you under tent arrest, tied to a bedpost if we have to.
A-And I'd hate to do that, Klinger!
I've worked so very hard for this, sir.
Easy, guy.
It hasn't been easy, smiling through the makeup.
I'm sorry, Klinger.
Better dismiss me, sir, before my mascara starts.
Dismissed.
Okay, another stitch and then we'll be finished.
Some more 30 chromic, and quickly!
You know my temper.
- Sponge that, please, Nurse.
- I still think we oughta do an operation for MacArthur.
- We could even operate on him.
- Now, that's a great idea.
- Maybe remove his pipe.
- We could suck him out through his own stem.
- You wanna finish here for me, please?
- Yes, Doctor.
My two favorite words.
What's your work assignment, Trap?
Supervise cleanup of the garbage dump.
Oh, the assignments are based on personality!
- Funny!
What's yours?
- Entertainment committee.
Oh, you gonna inflate your sleeping bag and do your Kate Smith imitation?
No.
I got something better planned.
Okay, this guy's all retreaded.
He's ready for the ward.
Orderly!
No orderlies around, Doctor.
What do you mean, no orderlies?
They're all out there manicuring the rocks.
I couldn't even get an X ray on this guy.
Are we running a hospital or a motel for visiting demigods?
It's Frank, the all-purpose idiot.
He's been like a crazed weasel ever since this thing started.
Why don't we have his legs ironed for the inspection?
Kellye, gimme a hand here, will you?
It's beginning to look like real army, thanks to you, Major.
Darling.
I just made up my mind General MacArthur wasn't gonna catch us with our "thesies" and "thosies" down.
Oh, Frank!
Super-duper!
That little twerp really did a good job.
Let's just soak it in for a minute.
I'm soaking, Margaret.
Ohh!
Oh, he's so handsome!
So commanding.
- Who's the little guy?
- President Truman.
Well, that's about the size of it, I guess.
Frank, please don't laugh in here.
Sorry, Margaret.
I can't wait to meet him.
We're practically family.
- Yes, darling.
- Dad and he fought the Huks together in the Philippines.
- Fought the who?
- The Huks.
A rebellious native tribe.
Oh, those Huks!
At home on the mantel, we have a picture he autographed.
"Best wishes to my friend, 'Howitzer' Al Houlihan.
Knock 'em dead, fella".
- That's so warm, so human.
- That Christmas they exchanged shrunken tribesman's heads.
Well, you don't forget a little thing like that.
This is where he'll sleep.
I'll bet he sleeps deeper than most people.
- Frank, do I dare?
- Well, Margaret, you are practically family.
Your eyes are sparkling like club soda.
- I feel so I don't know.
- I feel pretty "I don't know" myself.
- My face is hot.
- Uh-huh.
- And there's a lump in my throat.
- Let me kiss it.
- Oh, Margaret!
- Oh, Doug!
All right, everyone into formation, please.
Ah, Colonel Blake?
Colonel Blake, if you will.
Here, sir.
Mclntyre, on the other side of Major Houlihan.
Could you hold this, sir?
Captain Spalding, on the end right here.
Now make this good, Pierce.
This is going into the memorial album.
Right, boss.
And get in the front row.
I wanna catch those eyes.
- Wilco.
- Keep 'em spinning counterclockwise.
All right, everybody, move a few feet to the left.
Just a few steps.
Okay.
Now take just a few steps to the right.
Perfect.
Hold it.
-  - Got it.
Thank you.
- I had my eyes shut.
- That's okay.
So did I. Reviewing stand to convoy.
Are you ready?
Over.
Convoy to reviewing stand.
Ready over here.
Over.
Move out!
This is a rehearsal.
Repeat.
This is a rehearsal.
Shut up, Frank!
Shut up.
- That's not gin.
- No, vodka.
It's only a rehearsal.
How could you drink at a time like this?
With a little luck, we'll get sick.
## Company, ten-hut!
Present arms!
Eyes left!
He's much shorter than I thought.
He shrunk.
All that walking on water.
## General MacArthur, I've waited the whole war to meet you.
Klinger, I warned you!
I want a rehearsal too, sir.
I wanna show you I can do it in good taste.
I'm a psycho, sir.
A nutburger, a jellybean.
I got more dresses than your wife.
- Klinger!
- Let me out, I'll kiss your pipe.
- Go, Klinger, go.
- Get that moron out of there!
Sir, let me stay!
I'll change my clothes!
- Promise?
- Have I ever lied to you, sir?
Take him away.
Sir, no!
I'll wear something drab.
You'll be proud of me, sir!
I think they took away the wrong moron.
- Speak.
- Oh.
General MacArthur, I bid you hail and welcome to the 4077 th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital.
Although I have bid welcome to other dignitaries this is the highest bidding I have ever had the privilege.
-  Of.
- Of.
Privilege.
- Thank you, Colonel - Blake.
- Thank you, Blake.
- Introductions!
Introductions!
Sir, may I present my staff, General?
Yes.
- Two of my captains.
- Captain Sodom and Captain Gomorrah.
- He's Gomorrah.
- General, I've heard a lot about you, sir.
Most of it infantile.
Ah, thank you.
And Major Burns.
And his maiden aunt, Major Houlihan.
- They're not supposed to say that.
- Quit horsing around.
General, as a memento of this great honor I have prepared a souvenir book with pictures and a complete history of the 4077 th.
Which will be on sale in the lobby as you leave the theater.
Here, General, you see a picture of How did that get in there?
No lock on the latrine door.
Colonel!
For crooning out loud, Frank, it's just a rehearsal!
- I know, sir, but -  Attention, all personnel!
General MacArthur has just passed Checkpoint Able.
He'll be here in seconds!
This is not a rehearsal!
This is a real emergency!
Please, sir, over here, sir.
- Colonel.
- Here.
Company, ten-hut!
Present arms!
Eyes left!

{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Attention, all personnel.
Attention.
The eagle screams today.
It's payday.
All personnel will kindly form an orderly stampede.
Don't push.
Come on.
- Hey, come on!
- Hey, come on.
All right, can we have quiet?
- Can we have a little quiet out there, please?
-  All right, everybody, hold it down a little, will you?
Silence these rowdies, will you, Radar?
- Quiet!
-  - Radar, you've got class coming out of each belly button.
- Yes, sir.
- Now, let's get on with it, shall we?
- Uh, yes, sir.
You are aware that you're pay officer of today.
I know that.
I'm not some movie I just walked in in the middle of.
Yeah.
I just wanted to make sure you were aware of the regulations.
Um, "Each payment in military script "is to be made in accordance "with regulation 7-9-7/9-4-J "ascertaining that each signature opposite each name "corresponds with each said pay "and in the event that there is a discrepancy in the aforementioned "in either an overage or an underage of funds you are wholly and only responsible.
" Thanks.
Are you sure you got that, sir?
- Sure as you're one foot high, Radar.
- Cut that out.
Glad you could all make it today.
I'm your genial host, Hawkeye Pierce, star of stage, screen and radioactivity.
- Well, I guess I'll go pay the officers.
- Go pay the officers now.
Isn't he wonderful?
He'll be back.
May we have the first contestant, please.
Private Frank Daily, sir.
Daily.
Daily.
Right.
Okay.
Seventy-five dollars and thirty-one, two, three cents.
Just sign on the dotted.
Hope I got this right.
I'm just an ordinary chest-cutter.
I can't make change for anything over two nurses.
Next.
- Klinger!
- Yes, sir?
Just where do you get the gall to show up for payday dressed like a two-dollar streetwalker?
Sorry, Father.
I was worried about these earrings with tweed.
Not only is masquerading as a starlet not going to get you out of the army military regulations specifically state that no soldier may receive his pay unless in uniform.
In uniform.
Do you read me, Corporal Crazy?
Oh, give me a break, sir.
I gotta get my money.
It's important.
And next time stand a little closer to the razor when you shave.
My knees get in the way.
Dismissed!
March!
Hup, two, three, four!
Hup, two, three, four!
Sir, are you busy?
No, Radar.
Just looking for my wallet.
Clamp.
Payday.
Your money.
Retract the bowel, Nurse.
Just file it in the office, Radar, under "Broke".
Uh, yes, sir.
There we go.
- I don't look old enough to be his father, do I?
- No, sir.
I never been sure, you know.
I spent a week in his hometown once.
Suction here.
Okay.
Now, no-limit game.
Check and raise?
Okay?
Usual rules.
If you got the pink slip on it, you can bet it.
Oh, we gonna play or talk?
- Here's your pay, ma'am.
- Thanks, Peewee.
- Sir.
- Thanks, Radar.
Been in the family for years.
Found him on my doorstep.
Never regretted taking him out of the milk bottle.
Open for five.
Your five and five more.
Oh, Captain Kamikaze's in town, huh?
Next!
Corporal Klinger.
- This man is not to be paid.
- What are you talking about?
I said he wasn't to be paid unless he got into uniform.
What's this, chopped liver?
Here you go, Klinger.
- Just sign yourJane Hancock.
- You're a prince, sir.
You may kiss my ring later.
Are you just going to sit there and go over my head?
Frank, if I could yawn with my mouth closed, you'd have no idea how boring you really are.
Oh, phooey to youey!
Next.
- Here's your pay, Father.
- Thank you, Radar.
You collected anything for Sister Theresa's orphanage?
Oh, four I.O.U. S and an offer to give the bishop a nose job.
Oh, well, don't worry about it.
It'll get better.
Why, thank you, Radar.
Casting bread upon the waters, my son?
Oh, no, Father.
I'd never do that.
Food is sacred.
- All officers paid and accounted for, Hawk.
- Good man.
- You got a big day planned?
- Oh, I just figured I'd goof off and take a shower.
Oh, decided not to wait till the end of the war, huh?
I, myself, personally, am off to the Officers' Tonsil Wash Emporium and Whoopee Parlor to meet a nurse of the totally opposite sex.
And there isn't a thing she can do I don't deserve.
- Where did this come from?
- It was left over.
It's yours.
- A tip from Uncle Sam.
-  Ten bucks?
Hey, I can't keep this.
Well, then, share it with ten corporals.
- I can't.
- Or 20 privates at 50 cents each.
- Go buy some popcorn.
See the new hygiene film.
- No, you don't understand.
When you got funds left over, you have to fill out this special refund fund form.
No, you fill it out.
I'm gonna tie a giant olive around my neck and sink to the bottom of a martini.
I'm gonna need some help with this.
Radar, tell the United States Army, which I so proudly hail that not only do I send back their ten dollars I would also dearly love some compensation for dragging me out of my warm bed in Maine and giving me this ringside seat at the war which has already caused me to lose almost $3,000 of my civilian practice by not being there to say to various people, "Please lower your trousers and say 'Ah".
' - Uh, yeah, I just got one question.
- What?
Um, what is your maiden name?
Come!
Kim Chun Quoc at your service, Major, sir.
- Yes, yes, I know.
- Tiffany on wheels.
Like a P.X. Better even.
Uh, happy coat.
Just your size, Major.
Drives the honeys nuts.
You see this?
You know what this is?
Fourteen-carat cheap.
I'm a happily married man, mister.
Honeys aren't any of my business.
Ah!
The wife.
I got some pearls here.
The oysters cried when they gave them up.
Those are real beauts.
The major knows the best.
Of course I know the best.
I'm an American, after all.
Fifteen hundred bucks.
And I don't haggle.
- Too rich for my blood.
- Uh, yeah, 800.
But we didn't haggle.
- Not a penny more than five.
- You got 'em.
And I'll throw in an imitation set for 50 bucks, no extra charge.
What would I do with an imitation set?
Well, the major's happily married.
Uh, he must have something on the side, or he wouldn't be so happy.
- I owe the pot 50 bucks.
- You want me to lend you a hundred?
Give it to me free, and I'll marry you.
Not if either one of us was the last man on Earth.
- You're down 500, Doc.
- Who asked you?
There's a bonus for reenlisting.
You got terminal mouth, Sergeant.
Deal.
Excuse me.
Any room for a poor pulpit-pounder?
- Fall right in, Father.
- Oh, you're very kind.
You see, I'm hoping to raise some funds.
I gave at the office.
- No extra help, Father.
- Oh, no, no.
Don't you have something really pretty?
Life here is so colorless.
So blah.
- Oh.
- Now that's class.
Oh.
Oh.
- How much?
- Fifteen hundred.
- Oh.
- Uh, 500?
An oyster irritated for over a year to form these spherical delights.
- Two fifty?
- Too much.
Look, I can get you a strand for 35 bucks.
No irritation, no sweat, no nothing.
- The oysters were glad to get rid of them.
- Could I have a look?
I sold the last set to a major a couple of tents down.
I can get you the same in an hour.
A major?
Major Burns?
I don't know his name.
Uh, he had what we call in Korea a real "fertilizer face".
He bought cheap pearls, this major?
Also the $500 job for his wife.
He's a happy married man.
I could tell by the way the ring was cutting into his finger.
Attention, all personnel.
Due to the incredible mediocrity of last night's movie it will be shown again tonight at 2100 hours.
Captain Pierce, you dance divinely.
- My parents made me take divine lessons.
- Smart parents.
It broke my heart to leave them back there on Krypton.
You couldn't get any closer, could you?
Not unless I got behind you.
- Psst.
Psst.
- What's that?
Either the camp has a flat, or Radar has developed a slow leak.
- Uh, I've got to talk to you, sir.
- Not now, Radar.
Oh, I think you'll find this very interesting, sir.
It better be.
I was about to give this girl the dip of a lifetime.
State your business in one word or less.
Uh, well, you remember when you were spreading your onions on your hot dog?
I beg your pardon?
And I took down everything you said about how much compensation you wanted.
Mr. Kwang, can I have a martini, please?
And a Shirley Temple, extra dry.
- What's this?
- The three thousand dollars you asked for.
I think I love you.
You are to send this back in a plain brown jeep.
It doesn't make any sense.
Well, none of it makes any sense.
You just send in the right number of forms.
I can't keep money that doesn't belong to me.
Listen, I got a friend down at the 43rd made a mistake and ended up with He's going into the ices business.
- Three thousand dollars?
- Uh, plus ten.
Three thousand and ten dollars.
Mr. Kwang, I'd like to buy South Korea a drink.
Mm, 50.
There's one short here.
##  $831.75.
- Tidy little bundle of wampum, eh, Radar?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Uh-huh.
Taxes, federal.
That's what I help pay to keep our boys, which I'm one to maintain my wife's way of life that's over there - which is why we're over here.
- Yes, sir.
Then you got your unemployment insurance.
That's in case the war I'm paying for ends and I lose my job.
- Yes, sir.
Will that be all, sir?
- That'll be all, Radar.
Which leaves a grand total of $43 for yours truly to play poker with.
- Uh, Corporal Klinger to see you, sir.
- At this time of night?
Send that dressmaker's nightmare away.
Sir.
Sit down, Klinger.
What can I do for you?
Colonel, I got a proposition to make.
Forget it.
We'd regret it the rest of our lives.
Cooler-offer?
Four hundred and seventy-seven dollars.
- Three months' pay.
- I must say, that's admirable, Klinger.
And there's another 250 in a locker in Grand Central Station.
- That's terrific.
- Here's a quarter for the key.
- What?
- Let me out on a psycho, and it's all yours.
- What is this?
- This is a bribe.
Let me go home.
Klinger.
You are lower than a pregnant snail.
I can't stand it anymore.
There's a war out there, sir.
I'm aware of it, Klinger.
Don't you think I'm afraid?
My nerves don't sit still a minute.
I swear, some archaeologist a hundred years from now will dig me up slumped over in the latrine.
Then run away with me, sir.
Together.
'Scuse, please.
I got a date with a royal flush.
But as a favor to you, I'm not gonna mention the bribe.
Ah, come off of it, Colonel.
Bribery is as American as toreador pants.
Colonel!
-  Who is it?
- It's your boop-boop-a-dooper.
Come in, Frank.
- Margaret, you're wearing that sweater.
- Mm-hmm.
I want to be buried with that sweater, Margaret.
I know you think of me as a clear-eyed, iron-willed major toughened by action, brutalized by others' pain.
But there's another Frank Burns.
My other alter ego.
Is that the ego she dragged to the altar, Frank?
I'm talking about the sweetheart me.
The generous guy with a heart of gold and the soft underbelly.
Close your crinkly little eyes.
- What is it, Frank?
- Look.
Gorgeous.
Simply gorgeous.
Margaret, I could rape your nape.
You're sweet.
Where did you get them?
Oh, down in Seoul last time.
You know that high-class jeweler's in the lobby of the Chosun Hotel?
They must have cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
Now, I want one kiss for each pearl and something special for the clasp.
Oh, look how perfect they are.
I would have been happy with an imitation and here you've gone ahead and bought me the real thing.
Is there any special way you can tell the difference?
Oh, certainly.
You just rub them against your teeth and if they feel rough, they're the real thing.
Well, the peddler, that is, the jeweler warned me that these come from your Oriental-type oyster and are not always rough.
Whereas your common, ordinary, man-in-the-street oyster But if they feel smooth, it's the old "fakeroo".
Ohh.
I never thought I'd see the day when I'd own a strand like these.
I'm just amazed you were so extravagant for me.
Oh, well, you know.
All righty, boys.
Once around the horn.
I'm afraid my coffers are empty.
I'd like to help, Father, but I lost my diploma in the last hand.
- Yeah.
No hard feelings, Father.
- Oh, heavens, no.
I think I'll just go curl up with the Good Book.
- New deal.
- Greetings, officers sirs.
What do you got this month, Kim?
- Pipe this rock, Captain.
- Whoo-eee!
That's a beauty.
I'll give you 50 smackers for it.
Are you kidding?
The reward's worth more than that.
- ## - So any, uh Uh, what's that you're playing, Father?
Oh, just a little ragtime I play now and then.
You know, for a priest, you have no sense of rhythm.
It lightens the load.
I'll make you a deal.
Trade you loads.
I'll unload first.
Good Lord!
Three thousand clams.
All yours.
You see what a lot of praying can do?
Here.
I almost forgot.
Ten more.
It's an incredibly generous donation.
I'd agree, if I weren't incredibly modest.
Take it, Father.
Give it to Sister Theresa's orphanage.
Buy a new gargoyle for the Vatican.
There may be a sainthood in this, Hawkeye.
Yes, I can see myself on dashboards all over America.
Can you imagine the children's faces when they hear the news?
Spare me, Father.
It's makes me go Spencer Tracy all over.
And now, my dear, shall we repair to my tent?
- I didn't even know -  it was broken.
- Good evening, Major.
- Well, hello, Frank.
Walk me to the shower?
You're gonna shower with your pearls on?
Won't they get wet?
It's not terribly dry inside an oyster, Frank.
Anyway, real pearls take on a luster when worn next to the skin.
And these are lustering already.
But, Margaret, they're only on a thread.
Oh, I'll take them off before I get in the shower.
Sorry I can't ask you in.
- Hey, soldier!
- I wasn't!
I'm looking for your colonel, Major.
- I have no idea where my colonel major is, Captain.
- Yes, sir.
- Leave your duck in the shower, Frank?
- Oh, scram-skee!
Pervert!
Fork over 75 bucks, or I'll tell the A.M.A. You wouldn't!
You're bluffing.
How could you tell?
- I think I love this.
- Mmm, kissing?
You make a great lower-lip sandwich.
- You like Chinese food?
- Mm-hmm.
- You like walking in the rain?
- Mm-hmm.
Mmm!
How about eating Chinese food in the rain?
- Lend my 15, Frank.
That's my final offer.
- N-O spells "no".
We're not being quiet too loudly for you, are we?
Hey, give me 50 bucks.
I got an inside straight.
I hit it lucky.
You have all the luck of the navigator of the Titanic.
What about all our knee-scraping, commode-hugging good times?
What about the four-leaf clover that gave you a rash?
What about all the times in O.R.?
The bowels we resected?
We've been together through thick and thick.
Trapper, you have a gift for losing.
You put money in a parking meter, it comes up three lemons.
Frank's mating call.
Gross but effective.
Tee-hee.
You're right, Hawk.
I'd probably blow the hand.
Think I'll go back and fold.
As I remember, I was checking you for polyps.
- Sir!
- Oh, listen A Captain Sloan to see you, sir.
I'll see you at 6:00 after the war.
- I'm Captain Sloan, Supervising Acc-Fin.
- "Acc-Fin"?
- Accounting and Finance.
- Oh.
I'm Hawkeye Pierce, Aggravated Doc-Surge.
- I'd like to stay, but that would keep me from going.
- Hold on!
You're this month's pay officer?
I also double as rodent officer, rumor officer and termite officer on Arbor Day.
Well, you're $3,000 deep in trouble, Captain.
- Did you really think you could get away with it?
- What are you talking about?
Where are the funds you thought you could swindle the United States government out of?
As though anyone might think they could.
How long have you had this delusion that you're human?
Father Mulcahy's here, sir.
- Is someone in need of aid?
- Sit down, shorty!
We've got your boss.
Father, this is the kind gentleman who gave us the money.
Bless your heart, sir.
I've driven the money over to Sister Theresa.
The orphans now have milk in their stomachs and warm blankets on the floor.
- Well, I want it back.
- "Back"?
As in now.
As in all of it.
- Or you'll be preaching in the stockade.
- Dear me.
Captain Sloan, you're helping to ruin one of the worst days of my life.
Every time I've tried to register with a certain nurse someone's committed captain interruptus.
And now you accuse me of stealing.
But you're gonna really be in trouble if you harm one hair on this man's halo.
Did you know that contributions to the church can be written off on your income tax?
You're coming with me, Pierce.
First we'll check out with your C.O. Checkout time's not till 11:00.
Your 50 and 50 more.
-  Is that a hundred?
- How do I know?
I dropped out of school to become a doctor.
- Colonel Blake?
- Disappear, Radar.
Come on, will ya?
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Uh, Colonel Blake, Captain Sloan from H.Q. - Likewise, I'm sure.
- Henry, I'm being arrested.
Here's my authorization to take custody.
- We don't take that kind of card, do we, Henry?
-  Up to you, Colonel.
Um, it's too rich for me.
- Henry - We'll get it straight in a minute, Pierce.
- What are you gonna do, Henry?
- I just folded.
- I'll see your fold.
- Trapper Your captain was trying to abscond with $3,000 not rightfully his.
If you'll just sign this, we'll be on our way.
Four tens, you lose.
Forty miles, four tens.
Ha-ha!
It's mine!
Mine!
All mine!
I just love a gracious winner.
Well, you finally won a hand.
I just wish I'd lived to see it.
And I owe it all to you, pal.
I started with your watch.
A little cunning, a little cuteness, and now a fortune.
- You stole my watch?
- You want me to arrest him?
No extra trouble as long as I'm here.
- We're square.
- Not quite.
- What are you doing?
- A receipt, please.
And promise me you'll go out with other captains.
Hey, this is a once-in-a-lifetime shot.
What are you doing to me?
Look, Ravenal, the only reason you won that pot is because you stole my watch.
If I don't give that money to Chuckles here he's gonna give me the honeymoon suite at the Stockade Hilton.
- You're $8.00 over.
- I'll take that, for rent on the watch.
- Four dollars an hour.
- I only had it an hour.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll get it fixed.
- Who is this guy?
Boy, I wish I knew what was going on.
- I'll tell you later, sir.
- You always say that, Radar, but you never do.
- Are we here to play or talk?
- Anybody know how to play "Go Fish"?
How about "Hearts"?
"Old Maid"?
I'm gonna prove to you you can't win at cards even for free.
Collecting sevens, huh?
And tens and jacks and nines and threes.
And little lambs eat ivy.
What, are you rubbing those pearls on your teeth, Frank?
The pearls are real.
Your teeth are fake.
Why don't you give up?
You can't win.
- Ha-ha!
Gin!
- You lose.
- What?
- I had gin a long time ago.
Threes and nines and tens and sevens and twelves and sixes.
You've got about 85 points.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
And we all give thanks for getting us through another day without too much trouble.
Mmm, you're such a good kisser.
Grandfather left me his lips.
He died in mid-pucker.
-  You sure she's not coming back?
-  She's with Hawkeye.
Oh, then it should be a while.
He's very thorough.
Oh, Frank, without you my intellectual life would absolutely stagnate.
How does this snap open?
-  - Halt!
Who goes there?
- Out of the way, Klinger.
- I've got to have the password, Colonel.
- Bull feathers.
- That was last week's password.
I don't remember the damn password!
Then I can't let you pass, sir.
- Klinger.
- Sir?
If I don't get to the latrine something's going to happen that hasn't happened since I was six.
If that happens, Corporal, you'll be in the army until you're a little old whatever-you-are in correction shoes and support stockings.
- Now blow!
- Yes, sir!
- It's here.
- Great.
- Get the penicillin first.
- Right.
I'm afraid I'll have to take a rain check, Margaret.
Well, it's early, Frank.
- Was it something I s - No.
I think they're fooling around with my coffee again.
I got it.
-  - Go!
Cut!
Stop!
I said stop!
Somebody, stop!
What the Who the Klinger!
You better stop!
Klinger, fire for help!
My purse is stuck in the trigger!
Aaah!
Look, uh, you can have the gun, fella.
Yeah, the army's got dozens of'em.
Let's not have any shooting.
Isn't there one man among you?
The job's open, Margaret.
What's all the hoo-ha?
- Good work, Klinger.
- Thank you, sir.
Fastest fur in the West.
- Does anybody know who he is?
-  Okay, people, I'll deal with this.
No need for a mob scene.
I don't know.
Seven against one seems fair.
It's still seven against one.
What do you got here?
No broken bones, no infection.
You don't need penicillin.
He was certainly stealing enough of it.
Is there a plague someplace we don't know anything about?
The new black market price on that stuff is 50 bucks a pop.
Maybe we oughta sell all we have and pay North Korea to throw the war.
That hurt?
-  - Cat's got his tongue.
Or he sold it.
Anything goes with you kids, huh?
A guy told me about a sergeant down in Seoul the other day.
Sold his jeep while his major was asleep in the back seat.
Yeah?
How much are they getting for used majors?
Shall we sell Hot Lips and find out?
Too much mileage on her.
Cut these things longer, will you?
- They're supposed to be this short.
- No, they're not.
Now, look here, uh, Corporal, uh Perkins we don't care if you sell the 38th parallel for profit but penicillin is vital to our war effort.
We're not gonna let some patient die just because you wanna steal your way through college.
I didn't sell the stuff.
All right, then why'd you take it?
- I got my reasons.
- Such as?
What outfit are you with?
Who were those two other guys?
I don't have to tell you anything.
Well, you're certainly doing a good job of it.
You're not leaving here until we get to the bottom of this.
Call MacArthur.
Have my discharge canceled.
##  - Colonel?
- Yo.
- Someone to see you, sir.
- Not now, Radar.
I just got in some new Picassos from Bloomington, Illinois.
It's a Captain Goldberg, a Jewish rabbi.
Well, you can't hardly find the other kind.
- Colonel Blake.
- Oh, uh, Captain Rabbi.
- Are we alone?
- Well, except for us.
It's me.
Colonel Flagg, C.I.A. - Colonel Flagg?
I thought - Call me Goldberg.
Captain Goldberg.
Captain Goldberg, Colonel Flagg?
It's my cover.
As far as anyone knows, I'm a Jewish chaplain.
You got that, son?
Uh, yes, Your Hebrewness.
You caught a thief last night.
Well, just the old 4077 th on the stick.
He was stealing penicillin.
The theft of penicillin is getting out of hand.
Well, you might say there's been a rash of penicillin thefts.
-  - That's a good one.
It's sort of a joke.
We don't joke in the C.I.A. - Check.
- Leave the jokes to the Kremlin.
Double check.
Now, where's Corporal Perkins?
Colonel, that's not his name Captain.
- What does that mean?
- Well, I ran down his dog tags.
Turns out they belong to an infantryman, Perkins, Charles P killed in action about a month ago.
Aha.
Now, why would he use a different name?
Maybe he's C.I.A. No, I'm Perkins in the C.I.A. Oh.
Whoever he is, I'm taking him with me tonight, Colonel.
- Well, let me see if he's able.
- I want him.
That makes him able.
I know, but there may be medical reasons.
Don't cross me, Colonel.
We know where your family lives.
Hey.
I'm an American too, fella.
- Yeah!
- Quiet, or I'll use you to clean a cannon.
Yes, sir.
Now, what time can I have him?
Perkins?
- Uh, here you go, sir.
- Thank you.
Just get this signed by the attending doctors, Pierce and Mclntyre.
Pierce and Mclntyre.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yes.
Red marks next to their names?
Unfriendlies.
Yellow next to mine?
Work on it.
- Okay, all right, what do you want?
- Pierce, sign this.
- What is this?
- It's a release of a prisoner.
I can't sign this.
I thought it was to have you committed.
You'd better put your name on it.
- I've got enough on you to have you thrown out of the army.
- Is that a promise?
You could do with a little rest, Chaplain.
Soft bed, soft chair, soft walls.
What's that crack supposed to mean?
Oh, come on, Flagg, relax.
Have a drink.
- I'm not Flagg.
I'm Captain Goldberg.
- Oh.
Sorry, Rabbi Goldberg.
L 'chaim.
- What's that mean?
- Bottoms up, from right to left.
What about the prisoner?
I told you, we can't let Perkins go.
- And I told you his name's not Perkins.
- It's Goldberg.
- Sign it.
- Oh, come on, will ya.
Your brain pan's dripping.
It's your gung-holier-than-thou attitude.
Yeah, you'd do anything for the cause.
Remember the last time you were here, when you broke your own arm?
And you rigged that jeep so you could run over yourself.
-  - You're gonna kill yourself.
- If I have to.
- Hey, that's the spirit.
If we had more men like you, we'd have less men like you.
My orders are to do whatever I have to to break up this penicillin ring.
I have written permission to die in the attempt.
Good luck.
You don't know if there is a ring.
We've gotta get the truth first.
Give me that kid for one hour.
I'll get the truth.
Anybody can do that if you use his fingernails for kindling and teach him the soft-shoe with a cattle prod.
- Yeah, we kinda hoped to talk to him.
- Being amateurs at torture.
Stick to medicine.
Leave war to the professionals.
Stop by the hospital before you go.
You could use about 20 cc's of humanity.
Major Burns.
- You're - I know who I am.
You can knock off, Major.
I'll guard the prisoner.
But my orders The C.I.A. Can supersede anyone's orders.
Except the president's, of course.
Give us time.
Gonna give him the business?
It's not gonna be pretty, Major.
What are you gonna do?
Tell me.
I can take it.
I'd ask you to stay, Major, but torture's top secret.
Oh, I understand.
You come up with something good and then the other side starts using it.
- You're my kind of people, Major.
- Well  I'll leave you to your work.
Uh, if I can ever be of help, um if there's anyone I can tell on, you know Thank you, Major.
Get up, punk.
Now, I'm only gonna say this once.
Get lost.
Beat it.
Take a powder.
You're not gonna buy one in the back.
Frisk me.
Come on.
Aah!
There's this one back here.
One here, and one over here.
It was the Marquis de Sade who said, "You really know how to hurt a person".
You think I'd do this to myself?
I think you'd go over the falls in a thimble.
Novocain syringe.
- Hey!
- No drugs.
A little Novocain in your head.
You'll never know the difference.
Negative.
If I lose control, you guys don't have the clearance to hear what's in my head.
I haven't got the stomach for it.
Just do it, hmm?
- You heard the manic.
- Right.
Uh, the, uh, powder blue thread, I think.
Would you like it to say "Home, Sweet Home" or "Mother"?
I don't think he's ever had either one.
I'll just put his initials.
C.I. A crazy in the army.
- You guys'll get yours.
- Can we pick the nurse?
There's something happening here I can't make out.
Level with us, Flagg.
That Perkins kid didn't do all that damage to you.
- His name's not Perkins.
- All right.
Goldberg.
I'm Goldberg.
Gee, the next time you come here, I wish you'd pass out programs.
All right, gift wrap him.
You want something for the pain?
I mean to increase it, so you can really enjoy it.
This entire conversation goes in your file.
Sitting there, I've recorded every word you guys said.
You'll never guess where he hid the microphone.
- Something's fishy.
- It's the red herrings.
He's, uh, quite a man, isn't he?
Who's quite a man, Frank?
Colonel Flagg, the C.I.A. Guy.
Hmm.
You, uh, find him attractive?
- He's all right.
- Huh.
Well, if I were a woman, I would.
Do you often have these fantasies?
- What fantasies?
- About being a woman.
- I never do!
- You just did.
But, Margaret darling, you know how jealous I get.
-  - Frank, my hair is very brittle.
You keep kissing my head you're gonna give me a crew cut.
I'm sorry, darling.
I just want you to think I'm as manly as he is.
I know just how manly you are.
- Sit, Frank.
- Yes, dear.
How about one for the road?
To the land of nod.
- Thought you had a date.
- My mind's not on it.
How about the rest of your body?
- To the rest of my body.
- Long may it wave.
I'd give anything to know what Flagg is up to.
- Or down to.
- Right.
Sirs!
Mother!
You made it to the fort.
Someone's in the supply room again.
- That kid never knows when to give up.
- Let's go.
Right behind you, kemosabe.
Shouldn't be too hard.
He's all taped up.
- What if he's with his friends?
- It's okay.
So are we.
God, it's dark in here.
-  I got him!
I got him!
-   Be careful!
You'll tear my blouse!
-  -  Get him up!
I got him!
Hey!
-  -   Watch out!
I can't see anything!
- Somebody, turn on the light!
-  -  You hit me!
-  Somebody I can't see!
Get up Get up  Not too rough, boys.
After all, he is a man of the cloth.
Come on.
I suppose there's an official explanation for this, in addition to an honest one.
I took three of you to take me.
- Nice right cross, Trapper.
- Anytime.
What's all the commotion about?
New wrinkle.
We caught our friend here stealing penicillin.
- I don't believe it.
- Tell her, Captain Marvel.
- Help me.
- My people need it for barter.
They're desperate for it up north, so we use it to buy information.
We use it to save lives.
If I get information that'll end a battle sooner or information that'll avoid an ambush I'll save more lives than you will.
- Why don't you torture them?
- What did we send you to school for?
I'm checking his ribs.
Shall we send out for sauce?
Why are you harassing the colonel?
He's twice the man either of you are.
That makes him four times the man the two of us are.
He's C.I.A. I wouldn't care if he's C.O.D. - Then we could refuse him.
- This isn't fun and games.
- There's a war going on here.
- I sure hope my wife doesn't find out.
I'm leaving tomorrow with the penicillin.
Over my dead body.
Let me put that another way.
Frank, how could you be such a pea-brain?
Well, Flagg wanted to get on with his torture, and, you know, three's a crowd.
Well, I'll not have anyone tortured at the 4077 th, Frank.
We're a hospital!
- Well, we're also army.
- You're army.
- I bet if I cut you, you'd bleed khaki.
- And proud of it.
-  - Well, how proud are you gonna be if l How proud are you gonna be if I charge you with deserting your post?
Well he ordered me to leave.
- He's a superior officer.
-  He's a superior psycho.
His head's so twisted, he's gotta screw his cap on.
Radar Perkins is back, Henry.
- He's here?
- The M.P.'s just brought him in.
Colonel Blake, is this the man caught stealing your supplies?
That's him.
You oughta be flogged.
What, are you with the British Navy?
His name's Johnson.
He's a medic with the 415th Infantry.
Being a medic, son, you should know better.
Colonel, we're not taking the supplies for ourselves.
You see, rear echelon is giving the stuff out with an eyedropper.
The more penicillin we can get to guys on the front line who've been hit the more of'em we can save.
So sometimes we have to steal what we need.
It's either that, or we use our own money to buy it from the States or on the black market.
That's illegal!
As opposed to the war?
If you got all the supplies you needed, we wouldn't have anything to inventory.
Good thinking, Frank.
An army travels on its inventory.
Before I return him to his outfit, you want to press charges?
No, no, no, I don't think so.
Johnson, next time, ask.
If we've got extra, it's yours.
Thank you, sir.
I hate to break up this little tea party, but I'm certain Colonel Flagg would like to talk to the corporal about his escape and his assault on him.
Oh, Frank, that was a phony.
Colonel Flagg, sir?
He's the camp self-abusement director.
Uh, Doctors, why don't you see to Colonel Flagg whileJohnson here leaves the camp.
We should arrange it so the colonel leaves us alone indefinitely.
Good idea.
Yeah, why don't we see how he's coming after his operation?
- What operation?
- Give us a minute.
Good morning, Captain.
- Colonel.
- Congratulations.
I've decided not to have you guys thrown out of the army.
That's really hitting below the belt.
I've got the penicillin.
I'll settle for that.
Well, all's fair in love, et cetera.
I wouldn't eat the bacon.
You'll spend a week in the latrine.
- What about the sausage?
- Two weeks.
Vitamins.
There's not enough gas in the Hindenburg to put this guy under.
I had to promise him as soon as he went under we'd sew up his mouth.
Is this really on the up-and-up?
Do I really have appendicitis?
- You felt the cramps.
- You practically doubled over.
Your whole side is inflamed.
Even your pistol was hot.
Come on, now.
Breathe deeply.
- We've gotta open you up.
-  We'll close our eyes if we find any undigested microfilm.
You're gonna get that long rest you need, Colonel.
The sanitary c-conditions here We change the filth every day.
If I get an infection remember, I've got plenty of penicillin.
We've got plenty of penicillin.
And you've got plenty of nothin'.
Scalpel.
Anything I can do for you?
Anything at all?
- I'm fine.
- Major.
Excuse me, sir.
It was a simple appendectomy.
If your breath gets any hotter, you'll singe his chest.
-  - Let's move along, shall we, Major?
Don't eat the bacon, huh?
What was in the coffee?
- Beans from Brazil.
- Saltpeter from Jersey.
Where's the penicillin?
Most of it's hidden.
The rest is distributed in various rumps around the room.
And yours is next.
A square needle, please.
Look, he's all red, white and blue.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
All right, give me a clamp.
Hey, Hawk, what's this one?
##  - "Avalon".
- Wrong.
- "In a Little Spanish Town".
- Right.
- Please, I'm right in the middle of a stomach.
- Try this one.
##  - "On Wisconsin".
- No.
That was "O Shepherd, Guide Thy Flock".
Oh, I should've guessed that.
I've danced to that 1,000 times.
Shut up, will ya?
Shut up!
Shut up!
You shut up, Frank!
Everybody in this madhouse, shut up.
We're a little late, folks.
So good night from Name That Tune.
Clamp.
- Colonel?
- Yo?
Do you know what I found in this morning's mail?
Uh, now that's a tough one.
Hum a few bars, will you, Radar?
You're going home.
I'm going home?
You got all your points.
They're discharging you.
- Discharged?
- To Tokyo, San Francisco, then home.
I'm going home.
I'm discharged.
I'm going I'm going home.
- Henry, that's terrific.
- Henry, congratulations.
That's terrific.
- That's wonderful, sir.
-  All together now.
# O, shepherd #  # Guard Wisconsin Fight right through that line # I'm going home.
I can't believe it.
I'm going home.
Wow.
-  Oh boy, that's a "burny".
-  - You sure you don't want a drink, Radar?
- No, sir.
It makes my eyes turn red, and I fall down.
- It's kind of nice to lie down with red eyes.
- Yeah.
Ooh, you wanted to make that phone call to your wife.
Oh, right, right.
Now, let's see, Radar.
We're a day ahead plus 14 hours, right?
No, sir.
The States are a day ahead plus 14 hours.
- Well, then, it's yesterday in Bloomington?
- Yes, sir.
Well, then, I should have called her yesterday.
Well, you didn't even know about it then.
Why can't everybody be on the same time?
Because the Earth is round, keeps rotating all the time.
Oh.
I thought it was just an army thing.
Let's see, Bloomington.
It's 1:00 Wednesday afternoon right now, sir.
- 1:00?
Lorraine's not home.
- Yes, sir.
Maybe she just went to the store or something.
No, no.
Every Wednesday she gets together with Ella, Bea, Marie and Olive.
They go out Route 26 to the Old Red Barn for lunch.
They have two daiquiri's, a watercress sandwich and then Olive tells all about her hysterectomy.
- Every Wednesday, sir?
- It's a club.
Well, how long do they usually stay?
Oh, a couple hours.
Then they kill an hour on the way back feeling yarn at the knit shop.
Well then, why don't you call Mrs. Blake around 4:00 in the afternoon?
Well, no.
Olive usually gets carsick.
Better make it 4:30.
Uh, just to be on the safe side, we'll make it 5:00.
No.
Andrew has a trombone lesson at 5:00.
He's learning to play Ravel's Bolero.
- I won't be able to hear a thing.
- 5:30?
- 5:30.
5:30.
- Okay.
5:30.
Radar, Lorraine and the kids are going to die.
You know, the first night I'm home after we, uh, put the kiddos to bed?
Lorraine and I are going upstairs to our room.
That woman has the most fantastic body in downstate Illinois.
Thirty-six, twenty-four, thirty-four.
With skin like alabaster: Clear, soft, smooth and warm.
And she wears those little, short, flimsy nighties.
I think I will have that drink, sir.
Finally.
Finally, you're going to command this outfit.
Everything's happening so fast.
Discipline.
Adherence to regulations.
A taut ship.
I love tautness.
- To command is your destiny.
-  Oh, I can feel the power surging through your veins.
- Am I really surging?
- Oh, Frank, you'll be magnificent.
I just wish I'd taken R.O.T.C.
In school.
- I wasted so much time in the stamp club.
- I thought you were President?
Well, that wasn't leadership.
They needed someone to lick the stamps and I had the biggest tongue.
- Frank, do you doubt your ability?
- Mmm.
Do you want to see how sure I am of your ability?
Well, all great men have their doubts.
They say going up San Juan Hill Teddy Roosevelt was worried sick about breaking his glasses.
Look, darling.
I've been saving it for you.
Well, I haven't been promoted yet, Margaret.
Out goes Major Burns.
In comes Colonel Burns.
-  Yes?
- Margaret?
I think I'm surging.
Lorraine, is that you?
It's me.
I got good news, honey.
I'm coming home.
Honest.
For good.
Yeah, the orders just came through this morning.
I oughta be coming through the front door in about three days.
Honey aw, please don't do that.
Honey, please.
- She crying?
- No, she wants to re-cover the furniture.
Honey, I just wanna see you and the kids.
I don't care what the furniture looks like, except for the bed.
- Now she's crying.
- Sir, there's a time limit on the call.
Honey, now just take it easy, okay?
Good.
Are the kids home?
She is?
Well, put her on.
Janie-poo?
It's Daddy.
Num-num-num-num-num.
I'm eating you up.
- Sir, there isn't too much time.
- Leave him alone.
He's eating.
Janie, honey, would you get Mommy back on the phone?
Oh, and, uh, tell Andy to stop playing Ravel's Bolero.
Lorraine, honey, listen.
Now, there's a lot of things you have to do.
Well, like, uh My-My suits.
See, I've lost a lot of weight over here.
I mean, I'm uh, I'm a 34-waist now.
You won't know me stripped.
Wear your dog tags.
Honey, the brown double-breasted.
It might fit now.
So just take it to the cleaners.
Uh She Honey, I don't want your mother wearing my suits.
She what?
Well, that's dumb.
She went to a party dressed as Conrad Nagel.
- That's it, sir.
- Honey, I gotta go.
Now, Lorraine, don't tell anybody.
We'll just walk into the country club Saturday night start dancing and let 'em all cheer.
Lorraine?
Lorraine?
We got cut off.
Sweet Lorraine.
She has a fantastic body.
Okay, Radar.
Everything in these boxes is to be shipped.
- My uniforms go in the bag.
- Check.
Check-a-roony in a banana-ka.
Is there one or two "Js" in "fragile," sir?
Uh, one will do it, Radar.
- There it is.
- You find something, sir?
Yeah, that jar of mayonnaise we lost last Fourth ofJuly.
Hey, you better write a letter of apology to that navy chaplain.
I thought he copped it.
Boy, that's a greeny.
Oh Hey, hey, hey.
There's a picture of you and me, Radar.
Oh.
Oh, that's right after you took out my appendix.
Mmm.
You were one sick kid.
You know, I looked for that thing till 4:00 in the morning.
- It was behind your secum.
- I didn't put it there on purpose, sir.
- You saved my life.
- Ah, my pleasure, Radar.
- Um, sir?
- Yo?
There's something I'd like to tell you.
Well, now, you've got exactly 34 hours to tell me.
Yeah.
Well, uh I just wanted to say that I'm really gonna miss you.
Um, you know, my own father didn't have me until he was 63.
And, uh, first time we played peek-a-boo together, he had a stroke.
Look, uh, Radar, don't get gushy, okay?
You know how I am.
Oh, yeah.
Well, um, anyway, I made something for you.
- Oh.
- You know how you're always losing your keys?
- Yeah.
- Well  This is a key chain, and the cartridge is a fob.
- Well, hey, Radar, this is terrific.
- Thank you.
- It's inscribed in writing.
- Oh Oh.
Um, "To Colonel H. B from Corp.
O'R.
, Korea, 1952.
Hey, you know, the workmanship on this is beautiful.
- It's a Winchester.
- Well, thanks, Radar.
Um, I was gonna get you a bamboo flute, but they only had three-holers.
Oh - This was my father's.
It's yours.
- Oh?
- For keeps?
- Sure.
Oh, wow.
Oh, gee, what a beautiful thermometer.
- It isn't oral, is it?
- No.
He used to say, "If you want accuracy, go right to the horse's mouth".
He was a stickler for accuracy.
- Yeah, I'll bet.
- Yeah.
Well, um, thank you for everything, sir.
Thank you, Radar.
Hey, come on, now.
Let's get on the stick.
- Yes, sir.
I'll get this right out of the way.
-   - Oh, try this.
Try this.
- This is great.
- You didn't try this yet.
- Terrific.
Take that.
Isn't that good?
Now, that's good.
Hey, now that's delicious.
-  - What is that?
- Sea snails.
- Sea snails?
- By the "snee" shore.
-   Did you hear what he said?
Okay.
Oopsy.
All gone.
I'll get I'll get some more.
- Garçon, more booze.

-  I got it.
- I got it.
Come on.
It's my party.
- No, I got it.
- I got it.
- I'll tell you what, we'll flip.
Tails, you lose.
Here you go, Mama-san.
Thank you.
Just keep everything coming.
Hey, now listen, guys.
Guys, you cannot pay for any more booze.
I'm the one that's going home.
- Henry, we're giving you this party.
- Mm.
- You know why?
- Because I'm going home.
Wrong.
Because you're one hell of a human being.
- One hell of a human being.
- I got it.
We're past that part.
Now we're up to "one helluva human being".
- I'll tell you who's one helluva human being.
- Mm-hmm.
You guys are one helluva of a human being.
That's what you guys are.
- I'll drink to that.
- Let's all drink to that.
There we go.
How you doing, Henry?
I gotta go to the "toidy" is how I'm doing.
But, can I find it is what I don't know.
You go You go - You go out the back door, hmm?
- Okay.
You come to a big tree.
You pass the big tree.
You go to a second tree.
The toidy is the third tree.
The third tree is the toidy.
The toidy tree.
Thank God forJoyce Kilmer.
Hey, uh, speaking of trees you know, I'm really gonna miss you guys.
I mean that.
I'm really gonna miss you guys.
I wish we could all go home together.
- Henry, we had a lot of laughs together.
- Hmm?
-  - What?
What?
What?
Remember that time that Father Mulcahy caught you in your tent - with that lady war correspondent, huh?
-   You said you were giving an interview on the importance of clean underwear.
I can't wait.
Which tree is it?
Number one is for number two.
And number three is for number one.
Number four is the ladies' tree.
Don't go there.
Okay, 'scuse me.
- Oh, that's a burny.
- Oh.
Here we go.
-  -  Okay.
Hey, now.
- Hey, Kim?
Hey.
- Kim?
- What, what, what?
- Ow.
- Here's the box.
-  Now you girls know what to do.
Come on, ladies.
Over here.
- Over there, girls.
- Over there.
You know what to do, right?
- Right?
- Stand up straight.
I'm standing straight.
The country's crooked.
Shh!
Here he comes.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Henry, you okay?
Oh, fine.
But a lot of bark came off ol' number three.
-  -  Don't sit down.
Don't sit down.
What, what, what, what?
Attention!
- We're drumming you out of the military.
- Hot dog.
- Radar, cue the band.
- ## - Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake?
- Yo?
By virtue of the power of the authority vested in me - by Rosey's Bar and Grill and Pro Station.
- Mm-hmm.
And in the presence of those present who have faithfully served - under your barely distinguishable command.
- Mm-hmm.
- I hereby disrupt you of all military rank.
- Okay.
- ##  - Captain Mclntyre, would you do the dishonors, please?
From this day henceward - you will known as Mister Dr. Henry Blake.
-    And now, here's a box.
- A box.
I got a box.
-  - Don't open it now.
- What, what, what?
Henry, it's civvies.
We had the whole thing handmade for you in Seoul.
- Ahh - The tie is silk.
Handmade by a worm.
- Ohh, guys, guys, guys, guys.
- Radar, kill the band.
- ##  - Take five.
- Were you surprised, sir?
Were you?
Was he?
- Well - Do you know what is in that box?
- What?
- A brand new suit.
-  How did you know my size?
I traced you when you were asleep.
Let's get into uniform and play "Assembly," soldier.
- Sir, I'm getting a cold sore.
- Well, Captain Ahab only had one leg.
Well, he wasn't in the army, sir.
He was a whale guy.
- Play it!
- ##  - Ow.
- ##  - Are you sure that was "Assembly"?
- As close as I can come, sir.
It's really "Sleepy Lagoon" played fast.
- Ah, forget it.
- Yes, sir.
Company, fall in!
On the double!
Come on.
Move it!
Move it!
Move it!
Move it!
- You didn't even shave.
- It's not a school day.
Here comes Colonel Blake.
Company, Ten-hut!
Take it easy, will you, Frank?
It's all set.
You're in charge of the store now.
And, uh, stuff that whistle someplace.
Uh, does the Colonel wish to review his troops?
- No.
I just want to say good-bye.
- Well, okay.
- Your chopper's about ten miles out, sir.
- Thanks, Radar.
So long, Hawk.
I'm afraid just a handshake won't do it, Henry.
Trap, thanks for the outfit, it's really dressy.
Henry, that suit is really you.
If you're Adolphe Menjou.
Gwen.
- You old sky pilot, you.
- Bless you, Henry Blake.
Your work here will never be forgotten.
Thank you, Father.
Jennifer.
Klinger, that outfit might just get you that Section 8.
I made it just for this occasion, sir.
I was in such a hurry, I didn't get the back zipped.
I'll do it.
Up, sir.
There you go, soldier.
Sir, I have a picture of me.
Would you carry it in your wallet?
- Your pink evening gown.
- I knew it was your favorite, sir.
- Two minutes till your chopper, sir.
- Oh, thanks, Radar.
Well, uh, so long, everybody.
So long and good luck.
Henry.

Why not?

## -  Whoo!

# For he's a jolly good fellow # # For he's a jolly good fellow # # For he's a jolly good fellow # - #Which nobody can deny # -  Good-bye.

We'll take care of it, Henry.
You're fired.
That's right, Henry.
Your job is finished here.
Get on that chopper.
Prep him.
We'll be down in a minute.
So long, Henry.
- Have a good trip.
- Take it easy, pal.
You behave yourself, or I'm going to come back and kick your butt.
Radar, put a mask on.

I can take it.
