{START OF EPISODE 1}
Mo Mornin' No one could be sweeter Than my sweetie when I meet her In the mornin' Mornin' In the mornin' Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina Hello, Lamont.
I thought I heard you, son.
- Yeah, I heard you too, Liberace.
- Huh?
Nothing.
Grab that box of bottles and don't touch what's on the front seat.
- What did I just say?
- Don't touch what's on the front seat.
- Then don't touch it.
- Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!
- Well, what's in it?
- You'll see.
Didn't I tell you Never mind.
Well, what's eatin' you?
What were you doing in there, man, preparing for another concert tour?
You and Fats Domino.
You just go on and on, don't you?
Geemonetty.
What a talent.
What a gift.
- All in them ten dirty little fingers.
- What are you talkin' about, huh?
I'm talkin' about you sittin' around here all day getting your jollies on that piano while I'm out there in that jungle, slavin' my guts out.
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about.
Go get me the funnel.
- Now, listen - Get the funnel.
I mean, are you runnin' this joint or aren't you?
Now, if you done retired, just tell me.
I mean, that's okay.
Just let me know and I'll find you an old folks' home where you can sit around all day playing checkers and eatin' grits.
- You finished?
- Yeah, just about.
One of these days, I'm gonna split this joint, man.
I'm gettin' sick and tired of doing all the work, while you play that piano.
Boy, I wasn't playin' that piano.
I was cleaning that piano.
That is the best thing we got, and I want to keep it looking good.
And I do run this joint, and I work just as hard as you do, maybe harder.
- I do.
- Go see if we got any bourbon.
Sortin', arrangin', sellin'.
- Bourbon.
- Coordinate.
That's what I do.
I coordinate here.
I coordinate everything in here.
Oh, wow.
Say, Lamont, what does your old man do?
Why, my old man is a coordinator in a junkyard.
I got to get out of here.
This is ridiculous.
Why are you always talkin' about leaving?
If you'll just be patient, I'll be gone soon and all this will be yours.
Are you serious?
Do you think I gonna stay in this ridiculous business all my life?
- I'm going on to bigger things.
- Like what?
Like Like shipbuilding.
- Shipbuilding?
- Yeah, that's right, shipbuilding.
With what I know about iron and steel, man, I could become a millionaire just like that Greek cat that married Jackie Kennedy.
And you know something?
He started out poor, just like me.
Only one difference.
He started out a Greek.
Will you go get the bourbon?
You know, boy, one of these days, I won't be around.
I'll be going to join your mother.
- Why don't you stop?
- No, that's the way it happens.
The wife dies and the husband follows.
Usually of a broken heart.
I read in the paper the other day: "Wife dies, the mate follows.
" Hey, Pop, now, you know Mama's been dead for 23 years.
Well, sometime it takes a little longer.
And to tell you the truth I'm surprised I've been around this long with this heart.
Yeah, me too.
Now, you been complaining about your heart for as long as I can remember.
Now, they say if you have three heart attacks, you'll die.
Now, Pop, you done had at least 15.
Hey, don't cork that.
Let me have a little taste.
- This is for when we have company.
- Company?
We ain't had no company since we've been here.
- Now, give me a little taste of that.
- How do you expect me to build a bar?
- I said no.
- Just one little taste.
I said no!
Now get out of here!
Now you've done it.
You really got me upset.
This is a bad one.
Oh!
- Is it a tight feeling on the chest?
- Yes.
- Pain in the back and left shoulder?
- Yes.
- Dizziness?
Sick to your stomach?
- Yes.
I guess you're having number 16.
Come out and help me unload this truck.
What luck.
Ungrateful son, lonely existence bad heart, and not one lousy piece of brass.
Say, son, where would you go, I mean, if you did leave?
I just told you.
I got plans.
I just can't stand being poor like this.
Poor?
You think this is poor?
When I was a kid, there was seven of us in the family.
We slept in the same room, same bed, same underwear.
That's poor.
When I was a youngster, I wore one pair of tennis shoes five years.
Wore 'em out up to the name on the ankle.
Do you know them shoes they had called Keds?
I wore my till they said "K-S".
Now, that's poor.
You think you doin' bad?
Boy, you're rollin' in the lap of luxury here.
- Hey, what's in there?
- Now, just Just keep your hands off this and get back.
This thing is very fragile, and if you make me trip and fall You better not make me trip and fall.
Open that door.
Open the door.
Now get out the way.
Get out the way.
- What's in the box?
- Just go over there and sit down.
Now, I'll show you this thing when I'm ready.
Sit.
Sit!
Good boy.
I got something I wanna show you.
You ain't seen nothin' like this.
Look at that.
Not a mark on it.
It's perfect.
Don't you touch.
Perfect.
That's what it is.
It's perfect.
It looks like a pretty good piece of china.
China?
You can't even tell china from porcelain, Pop.
This is porcelain.
Genuine porcelain.
- So it's porcelain.
- So it's porcelain.
Now, there's the difference right there between a junk dealer, which is you and a collector, which is me.
Now, see, I reads all about this stuff.
Now, china is the common name for all kinds of dishware and that includes crockery.
Now porcelain is of hard paste.
It's white, thin and translucent when held up to the light.
A thing of beauty, class.
That's me.
I am porcelain.
You are crockery.
How would you like one across your lip?
You know, you're not too big to get one across your lip.
Okay, Pop, but just look at it.
Now look here underneath.
- You see those crossed swords?
- I can't see 'em.
- Well, go get your glasses.
- Wait.
I'll go get my glasses.
I bet I'll see 'em then.
- You see?
- No, I can't see it yet.
- You see?
- Wait a minute.
I got some here.
- Here's some good ones here.
- You see?
Wait a minute.
- You see?
- Ah, yeah, I see 'em now.
That's the trademark from some famous company.
That means this thing is valuable.
But if they are real, how'd you get your hands on it?
Okay, I'm gonna tell you.
I'm driving along a street in Hollywood.
Cherokee, Vista, I don't remember.
But it's in a neighborhood where a lot of old movie stars live now.
Retired, social security.
Anyway, I'm driving along and I'm looking for a garage sale or a house that's being wrecked.
All of a sudden, there's this woman standing out by the curb messin' around in the trash cans in front of a house.
- White woman?
- Yeah.
She's got orange hair.
She's got orange hair, and she's wearing a negligee.
Don't mess around with them, boy.
This negligee was a see-through thing, and she was wearing a pair of mules.
Don't fool around with them, especially if they're wearing mules.
This woman was about 90 years old.
Ain't nothin' on earth uglier than a 90-year-old white woman.
The negligee was kind of torn, see and one of them mules was missing a pom-pom.
Now, I'm sure she was an old movie star.
I mean from the silent flicks.
She had to be in the silents, Pop 'cause she was old, and she had a terrible voice.
"Come here, sonny, I want to show you this piece.
" Yeah, that's the way they talk.
So she called me over, see and she started to telling me about this antique piece that she had.
She said the only reason that she was willing to sell it was that she didn't have no money, you know.
She said all she wanted was ten bucks for it.
I got to thinkin', Pop, that sad old lady, she didn't know.
I didn't have the heart, so I gave her 15 bucks.
What?
She asked for 10, and you gave her 15?
An old, ugly white woman?
You big dummy.
Big dummy?
Fifteen dollars for an antique piece?
Only way to know if it's not from the dime store is take it back to Hollywood.
They got some shops over there on Western Avenue.
- Western Avenue?
- Yeah.
I'm takin' this baby straight to Beverly Hills, man.
One of them classy joints where you really get the prices.
Yeah.
Pop, I got a feelin' about this.
We gonna hit it big this time.
I mean big.
Yes?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Deliveries are in the rear.
- Deliveries?
Why, you - Wait a minute, Pop.
No, listen!
Next thing, he'll be calling us "boy.
" - Let's get on out of here.
- Wait, Pop.
Look, you don't understand.
You see, my partner and I, we've got this item here that we're positive Oh, just show him the thing, Lamont.
Very interesting.
Where did you get this?
- What's it to you?
- Why do you ask?
You think we're thieves?
Think we stole it?
Give him one, Lamont.
Give him one across his lip.
Now, look, you don't have to worry.
See, I purchased that item from a woman in Hollywood.
If you want her address, I'll be glad to give it to you.
Well, I wouldn't.
I'd be glad to give him one across his lip.
- Cool it.
- Continuously.
Listen, we're businessmen.
I got a truck outside with my name on it.
"Sanford and Son.
" I'm Sanford and this is Son.
You want some identification?
Here's some identification for you.
Credit cards.
Sears Roebuck.
Montgomery Ward.
J.C. Penney.
Are you kiddin'?
Right here.
There's my pastor's name and address and phone number.
You can go by and see the Reverend Trimble.
Here's my card right here: Exalted ruler of the Wild Moose.
Are you kiddin', you want identification?
We don't need him.
Let's get out of here.
No, just a moment.
Please, please.
I'm terribly sorry.
We have to ask these questions.
You see, this happens to be a very rare piece of Meissen porcelain.
Probably around 1740.
It could be the work ofJ.J. Kaendler, the master modeler of that period.
And they sell for a whole lot of money, right?
Yeah, ol'J.J. You see, the crossed swords across the bottom are the trademark of the Meissen people.
Oh, yeah, see, the crossed sword, that tell the whole story right there.
Now, I'm prepared to offer you - That's genuine porcelain.
- And that ain't crockery.
- $750.
- $750 for that?
- I think it's a fair price.
- $750?
Well, perhaps I could stretch it a little.
All right, 850.
- Eight-fifty?
We'll take it.
- No.
I don't know now.
I have to discuss this with my partner before we make any definite decisions.
This won't take long.
Listen, if he's willin' to give us how much is it worth on the open market?
Do you know what the markup is on that stuff?
If he offers us 850, it's got to be worth twice that.
- Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
- If you can get it.
Look, Lamont, you only paid $15 for it.
Let's sell it.
We'll take it!
We'll take it!
Now, listen, now, it's my It's my piece, I found it, and I'm gonna put it up for auction.
- I just decided.
- But it's half mine.
We partners, ain't we?
And I want to sell.
- We'll take it!
We'll take it!
- Stop it.
Listen to me.
Now, you'll get your share and a lot more if we do it my way.
We gonna to put that thing up for auction.
That's what we gonna do.
I'm awfully sorry to take so long here, but you see, my partner and I we've decided not to sell at this particular time.
- I'm awfully sorry for your time.
- I think you're making a mistake.
I think he's making a mistake too.
I told you, Lamont.
I told you to get the money.
We'll take it!
We'll take it!
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention.
We will continue the auction with lot number 695 in your catalog.

Thank you so much.

May I have 7?
Will someone say 700?
- I don't hear nobody sayin' nothin'.

You gotta watch 'em like hawks.
See, they just makin' signs with their heads and their hands, just little body movements.
Do I hear 700?
700.
May I have 700?
You should've took that offer at the store.
You won't get that much here.
- Yes, I will.

Will someone say 700?

May I have 1,000 for this beautifully rendered porcelain?
Well, it's up to you, dummy.
Get away from me!
We should've been doin' this from the start and you should've been workin' the other side of the room.
You should've took the money the guy offered in the store.
- Just get out of here.
- You big dummy.
J.J. Kaendler made in 1743.
Will someone offer me $1,000 for this beautiful Meissen porcelain?

Go on.
It's your turn.
- I don't think I want it.
- Why not?
That's a great piece.
I don't know that much about antiques, but that's a fine-lookin' piece.
- I won't bid anymore, honest.
- You sure?
Positive.
- 1,500 it is.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You see, I kinda got carried away.
Thank you.
The bid is $2,000.
Fair warning.
$2,000 going once, going twice Sold!
You numskull.
You bungling, fumbling, clumsy, amateurish numskull.
$2,000.
You bid $2,000 after I got that jerk standing next to me to take it for 1,500.
Sorry, Lamont.
You said that was the way to get the price up, so I got it up.
Well, who asked you, huh?
You don't know nothin' about auctions.
What do you know about bidding?
Who asked you to get into it?
Well, you still got the piece.
You just bought it off yourself.
And what about the ten percent commission they charged me, huh?
I had to pay them $200 for the privilege of bringing that thing home again.
Do you know what that does to our saving account, Pop?
Well, all I can say is I won't be around to bother you much longer.
Don't start that again.
I mean it.
One of these days, I'll be going to join your mother.
And you'll be on your own.
Old Pop won't be around to spoil things for you.
You'll be free.
You hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm comin' to join you, honey Why don't you come off that, you old faker?
- Faker?
You callin' me a faker?
- That's right.
Well, I hope I croak tonight.
Then it'll be on your conscience.
It's all your fault anyway.
I told you to take the money in the store the guy offered.
But no, you had to have more.
More.
Give me more.
You just greedy.
- I don't want to talk about it no more.
- Me either.
I still got this piece, and it's gonna be my one-way ticket outta here.
First thing tomorrow morning, I'm getting out of here.
Well, go ahead.
Who needs you?
And take this old piece of junk It slipped.
It slipped right out of my hands.
You know my arthritis.
- It was an accident, honest.
- Bull!
You dropped that thing 'cause you knew it was gonna get me out of here.
Now I can't sell it, so I'll have to stay.
That's what you was thinkin'.
Well, you're wrong.
I'm still gettin' out of here, and I'm going right now.
Hey, Lamont, listen.
Wait a minute, boy.
Listen to me.
- What are you doing?
- I just told you, I'm leaving.
I should've done it a long time ago.
I'll be around here tomorrow morning to pick up the rest of my stuff.
But what what about my truck?
You gonna leave me without my truck?
You can't do that to me.
All right.
I'll bring this thing back once I'm settled.
You'll get your old truck.
You satisfied?
But it slipped.
Slipped right out of my hand.
Don't you believe me?
All I know is that you broke it.
Besides, I'm sick of the nagging and the arguin' and this whole stupid life.
You're holding me back here.
If I stay here, I'll never get married.
I'll never get anywhere.
I'll end up an old, broken-down junk dealer like you.
- I've got to get out of here.
- But we in business together.
We're partners.
You don't wanna break that up, do you?
Can't you understand the partnership is over?
But if we're not runnin' the business the way you like it - can't we talk about it tomorrow?
- It's too late for that.
Listen, listen, son.
Why don't I go inside and fix us some supper?
You realize we missed supper?
I'll fix us some ham hocks and red beans and some neck bones and rice.
Then we can watch a little television and turn in and tomorrow we can talk about it some more.
I know you got plans.
You got plans.
You oughta see 'em through.
And Lord knows I don't want to stand in your way.
So what'll it be, son?
The ham hocks or the neck bones?
Hey, Pop, you got my breakfast ready?
I don't smell nothing cookin'.
"By the time you read this I will be with your mother in that great junkyard in the sky.
I think it's better this way.
I ain't decided how I'm gonna do it.
I was gonna use that World War I rifle but my arm was too short to point it at myself and pull the trigger.
I think it's better this way.
" Hello, Operator, get me the police.
Quick.
This is an emergency.
Don't do it, Pop.
Please don't do it.
Hello, Police?
Listen, I just found a note that my father left me.
What I'm afraid of is that he's gonna do something foolish.
That's right, a suicide note.
His name is Fred Sanford.
What does he look like?
He's about five-eight, not too much hair.
And, oh, yeah, did I tell you he's black?
Right.
Put that down.
He's black.
What?
How much does he weigh?
Uh, I'd say about 180.
You creep.
You miserable, old creep.
Now, wait a minute, Lamont.
I said in the note I thought it would be better that way, but if you don't think so, I won't do it.

S. Social security, S. Happy birthday to me All social security lines are temporarily busy.
Please remain on the line and one of our service representatives will speak to you.
This recording does not repeat, so please wait until a line is free.
Bet I wouldn't have to wait if I was white.
Hello?
Yes.
Huh?
Now, is this a person talking, or is this a machine?
Well, good, 'cause this is a person talkin' too.
This is Fred Sanford.
That's S-A-N-F-O-R-D period, speakin'.
Yeah, I'm 65 years old today.
Yeah, and what I want to know is how do I start getting my social security?
Takes how long?
Three months?
Well, how come it takes so long?
Well, I can see why it takes so long.
Well, okay, bye.
- What's happenin', Pop?
- Hey, son.
Is that for me?
- What?
- That.
Oh, no.
These are for me.
I stopped by the Goodwill store and they was having a special on paperback books.
Eight cents apiece.
You can't beat that, Pop.
Hey, here's one.
Look at this.
The Everyday Book of Etiquette.
And here's another one.
Basic Fundamentals of Plumbing.
And here's one that we was really lucky to get, Pop.
A Beginner's Guide to Better Bowling.
Now, there's some good stuff in here.
We're gonna improve on our minds.
- Forgot, didn't you?
- Forgot what?
My own son, and you forgot.
What are you talkin' about, "I forgot"?
You keep talkin' about I forgot something, I want to know what I forgot.
Forget it.
When you get my age, you might as well be dead.
Nobody knows you're around.
Nobody cares.
Won't be too much longer.
Any day now I'll be going to join your mother.
Well, good night, son.
I'm going to bed.
If I'm lucky, I'll sleep until Gabriel wakes me up.
If not, I'll see you the usual time.
Hey, Pop, maybe you'd like to take this with you.
What's that?
Happy birthday, Pop.
- You mean you didn't forget?
- Of course I didn't forget.
Man, I had you going there for a while, didn't I?
That's a mean thing to do, makin' me wait all day for it.
Had you goin'.
You thought I forgot.
You like it?
Yeah.
It-It-It's It's a hat, ain't it?
No.
It's a lamp shade.
Of course it's a hat.
Hey, come over here, Pop, and try it on, man.
See if it's the right size.
See, I wasn't sure.
Ah, yeah.
- That looks hip.
That looks real hip.
- Yeah, I look pretty good.
I had a hat like this once, but it got run over.
See, there's different things you can do with that hat, Pop.
You can snap down the brim in the front like that.
I don't like that.
Make me look like a cop.
That wouldn't be too good for this neighborhood.
Or, or, or you could break down the brim on one side like this.
A whole lot of people like to wear it like that.
Now that made me look kinda queer.
You don't want your dad to look queer, do you?
No, I like it more like this.
That's the way Reverend Trimble wears his.
Yeah, that's the best.
Hey, Pop, look right here.
You see right here on the sweatband, it says "F.S." - What's that?
- What's that?
That's your initials, Pop.
What you think it was?
It's on the sweatband "F.S." could have meant "for sweating.
" Well, you just take good care of that hat.
I don't want you wearin' it around here in all this mess.
- Oh, I ain't.
- That hat ain't for every day.
This is for weddings and funerals and the social security office.
You see, that hat is a light gray, Pop, and it'll pick up spots.
I could've got you a black one or a brown one but gray sort of highlights your face.
- Yeah, it does do that, don't it?
- Yeah.
Brown will limit you in your wardrobe.
You can wear gray with anything, Pop.
- This go with every sweater I own.
- Yeah.
I'm glad you like it.
Yeah, I like it.
Hey, I almost forgot the card.
Wait a minute here.
- "Happy birthday, Dad.
" - You're gonna read that out loud?
Of course.
I like to read it out loud.
- "Happy birthday, Dad.
" - Yeah, but I know what it says.
I bought it.
You don't have to read it out loud.
But I like to read it out loud.
Now you hush.
- "Happy birthday, Dad.
" - I don't know what for.
Because I like to.
Now hush!
"Happy birthday, Dad.
" - It's only a card.
- Will you hush?
"Happy birthday, Dad.
The sentiment I feel for you, I simply cannot hide.
So I wish you happy birthday with loads of love and pride.
Even if I don't tell you that you mean the world to me you have to know you're everything a wonderful dad can be.
From your loving son, Lamont.
" That's real sweet.
Why didn't you want me to read it out loud?
Well, it's kinda corny, Pop.
- Corny?
- Yeah.
- You don't believe what it says?
- I didn't say that.
It's just that, you know, birthday cards, they get mushy.
Mushy?
Then you don't believe what the card says.
I didn't say that.
See, I like the hat, but I like the card better.
All right, keep the card, and I'll take the hat back.
No, you give me the hat and you take the card.
You don't believe it.
- I bought it, didn't I?
- Yeah, but you didn't read it.
- Of course I read it.
- But you didn't believe it.
- You're never satisfied.
- You ain't got no feelings.
You ain't got no gratitude.
I never heard you say thank you.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- Okay!
Say, you know, this is the best-lookin' hat I ever owned.
But I like the card and the hat.
- That hat ain't for every day.
- I know that.
If you wearin' that hat when it rains, I want you to take it off.
- Take it off in the rain?
- That's right.
It'll get spots, and you'll have a speckled hat.
But if I take it off in the rain, I'll catch cold.
A cold you can get rid of in three days.
A speckled hat you'll have forever.
- I guess you're right.
- Of course.
- Hey, we better start getting ready.
- Getting ready?
- Yeah.
We going out tonight.
- What for?
What for?
The hat's only half the present.
- I'm taking you out tonight.
- You are?
Sure.
You're 65 today, Pop and I'm gonna take you out instead of some chick.
Now, me and you don't go out together no more.
Why is that?
'Cause I'm 65, and I ain't no chick.
Okay.
Well, I'm gonna take you out for a drink then I'm gonna take you to a movie that you need a reservation for and then we going to dinner.
And I'm gonna wear my new hat 'cause it don't look like no rain.
You can wear your new hat, but put on a suit, a shirt and a tie.
I got to put on a shirt and a tie?
Pop, when you go out in style, you wear a suit, a shirt and a tie.
Well, okay.
You got enough gas in the pickup?
No, we ain't taking no old, broken-down truck on this date.
We going out high-style, Pop.
We going in a taxi.
- A taxi?
In a taxi?
- Yeah, that's right.
You mean we're going in a taxi?
Imagine that.
Takin' a taxi and ain't even nobody going to the hospital.
Hey, why'd I have to dress up for to come here, put on a shirt and a tie?
What are you talkin' about, Pop?
This is a nice place.
This ain't no honky tonk bar.
Look like a bunch of honkies to me.
Say, aren't you gonna take off your hat?
What?
- Aren't you gonna take off your hat?
- No.
- You can't sit here with your hat on.
- Why not?
Ain't gonna be no preachin'.
Just gonna be some drinkin'.
- Evenin', gentlemen.
- Good evening.
- What'll it be?
- What are you gonna have to drink, Dad?
Give me a minute.
Give me one of these Shirley Temples.
Oh, Shirley Temple.
He's only kidding.
He knows that's just something you make for kids.
Order something else, Pop.
You got, uh I like beer.
You got beer on tap?
No, sir, just bottled beer.
I don't like bottled beer.
Got too much gas.
Make me burp.
Have something else, Pop.
I don't like bottled beer.
Make me burp.
- You don't have to have bottled beer.
- I don't like to burp.
Say, I like canned beer.
You got a can of beer?
No, I'm sorry, sir.
Excuse me.
What's the matter with you?
Order something and stop makin' a fuss.
I ordered a Shirley Temple.
It's the cheapest thing they got here.
Stop worryin' about what everything costs.
I'm paying for this.
Well, let's go somewhere where they got some beer on tap.
- What?
- Let's find a supermarket and we can get a six-pack and drink it in the parking lot.
Well, have you decided?
How would you like a nice old-fashioned?
How would you like one across your lip?
Don't be callin' me old-fashioned.
You better talk to him.
He's not calling you old-fashioned.
That's the name of the drink.
That's what he'll have, an old-fashioned.
Fine, and for you?
I'll have a vodka martini, straight up, very dry with a twist of lemon.
And don't stir it too hard.
I don't want it bruised.
That was funny.
You don't want it bruised.
You big dummy.
Would you just quiet down?
Hey, this is a nice place, ain't it, Pop?
It's all right.
Ain't got no pinball machine.
- Not in a place like this.
- It might be in the back.
Hey, you got a pinball machine?
I told you they didn't have no pinball machine.
Everybody's looking at you.
Well, let 'em look, but don't let 'em touch.
Here we are.
A vodka martini and an old-fashioned.
- Where's the ice cream?
- The ice cream?
Look like a sundae to me.
- How much do we owe you for the drinks?
- That'll be $2.50.
Two dollars and fifty cents?
Two-fifty?
Here's three dollars.
Keep the change.
Oh, thank you very much.
And a fifty-cent tip.
Three dollars for two drinks.
We could've got a half case of muscatel for three dollars.
Would you just pipe down and drink your drink?
Oh, wow.
That's sweet.
Why, that's like drinkin' syrup.
If you're gonna get me some syrup, why not get me some hotcakes to go with it?
All right, just don't drink it.
Let's get out of here.
It's almost time for the movie anyway.
Good.
I don't care if we do leave here.
Ain't got no beer on tap and they servin' them sweet drinks and don't even have a pinball machine.
What kind of place Hey, get a pinball machine!
- Hey, man, watch that hat.
- Oh, excuse me.
Wow.
You know what?
You sure can pick 'em.
- What are you talkin' about now?
- This Fiddler on the Roof.
Whatever it is.
What is it?
What is it?
It's a musical, Pop.
A great musical.
I don't believe you.
You sit there and you watch it and you still don't know what it's all about.
I know what it's all about.
It's all about a milkman with a ugly wife and five daughters, and he's always fussin' at God.
I take you to see a movie that was the biggest hit on Broadway and it don't mean nothin' to you.
Don't mean nothin' to me 'cause I ain'tJewish.
Then how come it ran for seven years on a stage in New York?
- What does that mean?
- A whole lot ofJews in New York.
And I was readin' about how it was a big hit over in Japan too.
Whole lot of'em over there too.
You don't know nothing.
You know what the trouble with you is?
You don't have what it takes to understand.
If it ain't some TV show, then you just don't dig it.
It's gotta be something you can understand, like Gunsmoke.
What's wrong with Gunsmoke?
There's nothing wrong with Gunsmoke.
It's just that there's other things.
At least Marshal Dillon don't stand around complaining.
You know don't catch him yelling up at the sky.
If somethin' bothers him, he just draw his.
45 and he don't even have to bother God.
There's no use talkin' to you.
Hey, come on.
The second half is starting.
- You mean there's more?
- Of course there's more.
- We only seen half of it.
- I ain't going back in there.
What do you mean, you're not going back in there, Pop?
Don't let me stop you.
You go back in.
I'll take the bus home.
You did plenty.
You bought me a new hat and bought me a sweet drink.
See, I'll just go on home and watch TVwith my new hat on.
- Oh, come on.
Let's go.
- No, don't let me spoil it for you.
No, I told you I was gonna take you out to dinner.
I hope you like this place 'cause you ain't liked the other places we've been.
I like where we've been going, but I don't like what we've been gettin'.
Gentlemen, the second half is starting.
You better hurry.
Oh, man, the movie's too long.
Don't want to hear that.
Get them cartoons over here.
This way, gentlemen.
Here's a nice table for two.
Say, we're gonna need another chair.
- Three chairs?
- Yeah.
One for me, one for him and one for my new hat.
Excuse me, sir.
- Thank you.
Can I use that napkin?
- Oh, yes, sir.
I'll be right back with a menu.
This is a real Chinese restaurant, ain't it?
No, it's a pizza parlor.
Of course it's a Chinese restaurant.
I can't eat in here.
I can't eat that Chink food.
Are you gonna start again?
You never know what they gonna have in it, see.
Really.
I heard of a fella once who was eating some chop suey - and you know what they found in it?
- I don't want to hear about it.
Soap.
That's what they found in it.
See, these people do their cookin' and laundry in the same pot.
Thank you.
Say, this is in Chinese.
We won't even know what we're eatin'.
The English is on the other side.
And I'll do the orderin'.
We'll have some egg foo yung some lobster Cantonese some pineapple chicken and some fried won ton.
Fried won ton?
What's that?
That's Chinese kreplach.
Oh, I ain't gonna eat that.
That stuff will kill you.
What would you like, sir?
I'd like some ham hocks and lima beans.
Are you crazy?
You know they don't have that here, Pop.
This is a Chinese restaurant.
Just relax.
You'll like what I ordered.
- That'll be all, Waiter.
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
You know, these Chinese sure are getting pushy.
Maybe we shouldn't have let them in the U.N. Hey, listen, want my son to help you with that check?
- What?
- He knows this place.
He can help you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Hey, look here.
I wouldn't be here if it weren't for my son.
- This is my birthday.
- Oh, is that so?
Yeah.
I'm 65 today.
- I don't look it, do I?
- No, you don't.
- Pop, why don't you stop it?
- I'm talking to this man over here.
I got freedom of speech.
Hey, look here.
This dinner is just part of my birthday present.
- My son bought me this new hat.
- Well, it's very nice.
- You're a very lucky man.
- Yeah, I figure I'm lucky.
Hey, listen here.
He took me to the movie too.
We saw that picture Fiddler Up a Roof.
- You see that yet?
- No, not yet.
Well, save your money 'cause we left in the middle of it, it was so bad.
Is that so?
I heard it was very good.
He must be one.
What's the matter?
That was a good movie, and I liked what I saw of it.
Oh, what you know, dummy?
- Okay, darling?
- Hey, hey, listen.
I don't look 65, do I?
No, you don't.
Happy birthday.
Hey, thanks a lot.
That's a nice white fella.
You're a pest.
A great big pest.
You was being a pest when you was bugging that man.
Now I want you to just sit here and mind your own business, all right?
Egg foo yung.
Lobster Cantonese.
Pineapple chicken.
This is fried won ton.
Very good.
That smells!
It smell like insect spray.
I'll bet you they gave it a shot so that when it got out here would nothin' on the plate move.
That did it.
Now I've had it.
I had it with you and this whole dumb evening and all your complaining.
You don't have to eat.
You don't have to do nothing 'cause I'm leaving.
There's nothing that satisfies you.
Waiter, can I have the check, please?
Here.
Take this $5.00 and go buy your own dinner and celebrate the way you want to, but this is it with me and you for tonight.
- Is anything wrong, sir?
- Everything is fine.
I have to leave.
- Here.
Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.
You want to take food home?
- You want doggie bag?
- I don't think so.
Chinese food good for you.
Lots of vegetable, rice.
Very healthy.
I don't like Chinese food.
Make me burp.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not gonna eat that.
Say, Pop, where's breakfast?
Man, I gotta get goin'.
Pop!
You ain't even dressed!
Ain't you gonna cook breakfast?
I ain't cookin' nothing.
I'm retired.
Retired?
Yeah.
I applied for social security.
And you know how much I'll be getting?
They pay high as $213.10.
That's enough for me to retire.
Are you crazy?
They won't pay you much 'cause you haven't earned much.
- Oh, yeah?
You wait and see.
- They pay you by what you've earned.
I ain't done nothing for you and nobody else.
You're lookin' at a man of leisure.
Say, what's that number there?
Five, five, five one, nine seven, three.
Yeah, you're on your own, boy.
Hello, Social Security?
This is Fred Sanford.
That's S-A-N-F-O-R-D period, speaking.
Yeah, I'm applying for social security, and what I want to know is how much will I be gettin' every month?
Yeah, I'll wait.
Sanford.
If I was you, I'd go down to the diner and get some breakfast 'cause this kitchen is closed, due to retirement.
Hello?
Yeah.
Did you find it?
How much?
How come?
How you want your eggs?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Come on, Pop.
The taxi will be here any minute.
- We gonna be late.
- I'm comin'.
Well, here I am.
How do I look?
How do you look?
You look like a well-dressed penguin.
I thought you'd like it.
I haven't had this suit on sinceJoe Louis beat Max Schmeling.
Me and your mama really celebrated that night.
Went to Club Alabam.
We had fun.
How you feelin', son?
I feel terrible, Pop.
I got butterflies in my stomach and my heart's poundin', and I can't keep my hands still.
It serves you right.
The whole thing is ridiculous.
It won't work.
I give it two weeks.
Don't start.
You been against this ever since I told you I was getting married.
Who, me?
Yes, you.
If I listened to you, I'd never get married.
You just don't want me to get married.
That's what it is.
Well, you hardly know the girl.
How long y'all been going together?
- Two months?
- So what?
- How long did you go with Mama?
- Two and a half years.
That's right.
I went with your mama two and a half years before I kissed her on the cheek.
And that was on New Year's Eve.
At 12:00.
Straight up.
In the dark.
We do things a lot faster today.
I don't want to talk about that, Pop.
Have you got the ring?
Yeah, I got the ring.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
What's the matter with you?
- Where is it?
- I had it right here in one of my I gave you that ring last night.
If you lost that ring Just settle down.
Here's the ring right here.
I got it wrapped up here in this handkerchief.
Take it out of that handkerchief.
That's gotta go on her finger.
Well, I bet you my handkerchief is just as clean as her finger.
Just hold on to that ring.
Pop, where is the cab?
- Where's the taxi?
- I called them.
Call 'em again.
They're not here yet.
They should've been here.
- I called 'em an hour ago.
- Get in there and call 'em again.
Everything goes wrong.
I'm getting married, man, and the taxi's not even here.
Y'all gotta learn how to relax.
I'll - Hey, Pop, tell 'em it's an emergency.
- I'll tell 'em.
Just hold on.
Hello.
Say, is this the taxicab company?
Yeah, well, this is Fred Sanford calling.
That's S-A-N-F-O-R-D period, speaking.
Yeah, listen, I called for a cab about an hour ago and so far, there no cab come yet.
Hey, listen, is this a white cab company?
Y'all don't have to worry no more.
Everything is cool now.
No, look, if you don't want to stop, just slow down.
We'll get in.
Okay.
Bye.
They ain't gonna come.
What are we gonna do, Pop?
- Everything gonna be all right.
- Everything goes wrong.
- What are we gonna do?
- Listen, we'll take the truck.
The truck?
We're not gonna take this broken-down truck on my wedding day.
- What's wrong with that?
- Everybody will be laughing at us, Pop.
They won't laugh.
We'll park the truck over there - by Mama's Kitchen around the corner.
- Oh, just get in the truck.
- This place hasn't changed much.
- What?
Church.
I haven't been here since we laid your mother away.
That's a nice thing to bring up on my wedding day.
Casket was sitting right here, where you gonna get married.
Sure looked good, your mama, layin' there with a new dress on.
Looked good enough to take to Chinatown.
I don't know what you had to get married here for anyway.
Could've went on down to City Hall and had it done.
Just a waste of money, that's what it is.
I already told you, Pop.
Crystal wanted a church wedding.
Crystal?
It wasn't Crystal.
It was the whole uppity family.
- Bunch of jive niggers.
- Pop!
They're sittin' over there.
They'll hear you.
Just keep it down.
Just don't be surprised if they take you somewhere and make you put on a chauffeur's cap.
See.
They playin' Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and you Sidney Poitier.
Look at 'em sitting over there like they too good to mix with us.
They're not supposed too, Pop.
Never thought I'd see the day where there'd be segregation in Central Avenue Baptist Church.
I already told you.
They're not supposed to mix with us until after the wedding.
What did you say her old man does?
Work at a post office?
That's right.
He works in a post office.
He's in charge of a window.
I bet he's in charge of all of the windows cleaning 'em.
I'm tellin' you you're makin' a mistake, gettin' mixed up with that bunch.
Get used to the idea.
We already agreed to all the conditions you wanted.
We're gonna get married, and we're gonna live with you and I'm gonna stay in the business.
We're gonna stay with you right until the day that you get laid out in this church, just like Mama.
And that might be the next service, if you don't shut your big mouth.
I was thinkin' about you.
You know, you're just throwing your life away.
Throwing my life away?
I'm Lamont Sanford, a lousy junk dealer who's over 30.
I'm lucky to get her.
That girl could've had her pick, but she picked me.
Now, Pop, this could be the happiest day of my life, if you'd just back off.
I ain't gonna say another thing.
Try to help you, but you won't listen.
- So you on your own, boy.
- Good.
- I'm gonna button my lip.
- Perfect.
I ain't gonna say one more thing.
Thank you.
I give it two weeks.
She's late, ain't she?
I bet she don't show up.
I thought you said you were gonna shut up.
I don't give it a week.
I bet she don't show up at all.
The bride has just arrived, Mr. Sanford.
- I lose.
- I'm sorry?
Nothing, Reverend Trimble.
He didn't say nothing.
Why don't you and your father take your place.
You ready for the execution?
Need a blindfold?
She ain't in no big hurry to get up here, is she?
Maybe she got a bad heart.
Did she have a checkup?
You could be marrying a very sick girl, son.
Think about them doctor bills.
Here she is.
Dearly beloved, we're assembled here to join together in bonds of Christian marriage this man and this woman.
It is these Christian bonds that serve as an anchor for your continued happiness.
Who gives this woman to be married to this man?
I do.
Do you, Lamont Grady Sanford take Crystal Simpson to be your lawful wedded wife to love her and cherish her as you do your own life - until death do you part?
- I do.
Do you, Crystal Simpson take Lamont Grady Sanford to be your lawful wedded husband to love him and cherish him as you do your own life until death do you part?
You have brought rings Wait a minute, Reverend Trimble.
She said no.
She did?
I wasn't listening.
Crystal, honey, you were supposed to say, "I do.
" But I don't.
I mean, I can't marry him.
I'm sorry, Lamont.
Well, this is very unusual.
- I don't know - Did you say somethin' to her?
- I ain't said nothing to her!
- Crystal, baby, what's wrong?
There's nothing wrong, Mother.
I can't do it.
I changed my mind.
Oh, there, there, honey.
Well, you don't have to marry him if you don't want to.
- Thank you, Mother.
- Can we have a few minutes together?
- Come on, Crystal - Take your hands off her!
She doesn't want to marry you.
I knew it was a mistake marrying a common, ordinary junk man.
- Now, listen, sister.
- Look, stay out of it, Pop.
I ain't gonna let this liver lip broad insult you!
Oliver, did you hear what he called me?
- Listen - Well, don't stand there.
Do something about this!
Oh, be quiet, everybody!
I just changed my mind, that's all.
There's just no need to go on like this.
You're all behaving just just like children!
- That's exactly right.
- Yeah, that's right.
Say, Crystal, let's go to city hall.
Just the two of us, okay?
My daughter is not going to marry you, you nobody.
Nobody?
If anybody marryin' nobody it's my son who ain't marryin' nobody.
Ain't nobody marryin' nobody.
Will everybody stop it?
Now just leave this thing up to me and Crystal, all right?
- Crystal?
Crystal!
- Let her go!
- She's gone!
- You're better off without her!
She's better off without him, you junk dealer!
You better get out of my face!
You too!
That was a nice service, Reverend Trimble.
Thank you.
What'd she have to do that for, Pop, huh?
What for?
I don't know.
Don't worry about her.
She wasn't too much.
She had ugly legs.
- She had beautiful legs.
- Skinny.
Skinny legs.
Skinny legs.
In a few years, her veins start showing.
Her leg look like Italian salami with the rope wrapped around it.
Here.
Have a drink.
Make you feel better.
I don't understand it, Pop.
She was so sweet.
Yeah, sweet before the wedding.
Then after the wedding, she'd be just like her mama: King Kong in bloomers.
What did she have to show up for just to say no, Pop?
- She made me look like a fool.
- Forget about her.
Let's eat some of this food here.
Look at the nice gifts and everything.
What a spread.
Look here.
You know, the delicatessen did a good job, didn't they?
Look at all these nice things: Potato salad, slaw.
And look here.
Here's some chopped liver.
That's Jewish soul food.
- Here.
Have some.
- I don't want nothing to eat.
She made me look like a fool.
Everybody's gonna be laughing at me.
"Lamont got stood up.
He got left waiting at the church.
" Say, Pop, let's move back east.
It'll help me forget.
We could go to Newark.
They got a black mayor there.
Black mayor ain't gonna help you forget.
He got enough troubles of his own.
You just carry on, son.
You got your whole life before you.
Forget about that.
Go out and have fun.
Meet you a girl and live it up.
"Live it up.
" You got no feeling at all, Pop.
I just got crushed.
You talkin' about "live it up.
" Yeah, live it up.
See, it's like It's like biting an apple in the dark.
See, if the first bite is sour you turn it around and nibble somewhere else.
That's really a gem.
That was beautiful.
Who said that, Confucius?
Confucius?
No, I said it.
Always worked for me.
I been through quite a few apples in my time.
Well, just go nibble your apples and leave me alone.
I was thinkin' about you.
Let's change clothes and go somewhere.
Let's go to the roller derby.
That's terrific.
Maybe I'll be able to pick up a skater.
Well, they ain't too bad.
They won't have no skinny legs.
You're ridiculous, you know that?
Listen, I know how you feel, son.
So you had a disappointment.
See, it's like cuttin' away a corn.
At first, the toe is sensitive, then it hardens up so you can walk.
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.
I got a disappointment, and you got bad feet.
- It's the door.
- No kidding.
- Well?
- Well, what?
- Want me to answer it?
- No.
Have it framed and hang it on the wall.
- Rosetta!
- Oh, you poor, poor What a terrible thing to happen.
It's a shame your mother isn't here to see this day.
Only a mother would understand.
Thanks a lot, Aunt Rosetta.
Now, if that two-faced little brat comes around this neighborhood - she'll get a mouthful from me.
- Now, look, just forget about it.
Why don't you have something to eat and - Here.
Have a drink.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
I'm on a diet.
Well, since I'm here, I might as well have a little taste of gin.
- To settle my stomach.
- You mean a water glass full of gin.
- What do you mean by that?
- You know what I mean.
No, I don't know what you mean.
Last time you settled your stomach, it was so settled, you couldn't move.
I knew it.
I knew it.
I knew it all the time.
I knew it.
Didn't I say so, Rosetta?
I knew it couldn't last.
When I saw that little ol' gal, I knew she was no good.
And her and her wiggly walk.
Oh, you poor thing.
I feel so sorry for you.
Oh, yes, I do.
But I knew it wouldn't last.
- Thanks a lot, Aunt Hazel.
- I'll tell you what you do, darling.
You just come on over to our house and stay awhile.
You know, we love you.
Get away from old sourpuss over there.
Hazel, how would you like one across your lip?
You know, I don't mind givin' a lady one across the lip.
And that'll be the last time you give somebody somethin' across the lips.
- No, it won't.
- Oh, yes, it will.
If I hit you, I bet your lips get to the hospital before the ambulance.
- No, they won't!
- Listen, I fought heavyweights before.
- You better get - Hold it!
Hold it!
- Why don't you just stop it?
- Aunt Hazel Aunt Hazel?
You mean Witch Hazel!
I'm sorry as I can be, boy.
I don't know what to say.
- Thanks a lot, Uncle Edgar.
- I really felt sorry for you up there.
When that little girl ran out on you like that, I was thinkin' to myself "I'll bet he feels like a real dummy up there.
" That's what you looked like up there.
A real dummy.
She made me look like a fool, Uncle Edgar.
What's gonna happen if she shows up?
I'm gonna take her skinny legs and tie 'em up in a knot.
- It's definitely off, huh?
- You can bet your sweet - Pop!
- It's off.
- What will you do with the toaster?
- The what?
This toaster.
The wedding present your Aunt Elsie and me gave you.
Thanks a lot, Uncle Edgar.
That's just what we wanted.
A toaster.
- It's not much use to you now, is it?
- No, I guess not.
I really didn't have a chance to think about all this.
I was thinking, long as I'm here Well, you see, I mean Edgar, why'd don't you just admit that you want your toaster back?
No, I was wondering.
See, we don't have one and the thing cost 19.95.
You know good and well you didn't buy that toaster.
That's something you had left from the riot.
Now, wait a minute, Fred.
That was a legitimate purchase.
- I bought it.
I bought it - In a pool hall.
I'll tell you the truth.
I was gonna ask about these sheets.
Well, since they're not gonna be used, it's a shame to make 'em go to waste.
And they wasn't monogrammed.
I can take them back.
Hey, kid, don't put your feet up on my good couch.
Go on over there with the kids and have a piece of cake.
This couch is for drinkin'.
- What did you do with my tablecloth?
- I don't know, Aunt Hazel.
- It should be here with the presents.
- Well, it's not here.
- Well, I don't know.
- It's supposed to be with the presents.
Or maybe you didn't think it was good enough for you.
Have you seen her tablecloth?
Yeah, it's here on the table.
We're using it.
Well, that's a fine thing to do using the wedding presents before they're even married.
- Now we can't even take 'em back.
- Well, I didn't get married.
I'll buy you another tablecloth, Aunt Hazel.
It's only me, your ol' aunt.
And my gift was the first one they used, and now I can't ever take it back.
- Well, I'll take the cheese board back.
- I may as well take my toaster back.
Come on, you children.
Say, what are you people doin'?
What are you Just stop it!
Would you just stop it?
You tell 'em, son!
What's the matter with you people?
I don't believe you.
I just had the shock of my life, and what are you all doing?
You're standing around here worrying about your dumb wedding presents.
Well, I don't want you or your presents in my house for another second!
I'll tell you exactly what you could do.
You could figure who belongs to what out in the yard!
And don't say we didn't feed you!
And And here's some dessert!
Hazel, you never looked sweeter.
That was nice.
I enjoyed every moment.
What a disastrous day this has been.
No, son, it's more like the answer to a prayer.
"Lead us not into temptation.
" You got detoured just in time.
I'm goin' upstairs and stretch out, Pop.
I really need it after today.
Yeah, son, I know how you feel.
Oh, say, Pop.
I forgot to cancel the honeymoon suite.
Well, it's too late now.
They're not gonna give you your deposit back.
So why don't you go there anyway?
They got TV in the room.
You can watch the roller derby.
No.
I don't think so.
I'm just going to bed.
Okay, son.
Hey, Pop, that hotel is out by the beach.
How'd you like to spend a few days near the ocean?
- Me?
- Yeah.
We could take a couple bottles of this champagne - and we could take a little vacation.
- Vacation, yeah!
I'll get the checkerboard and pack a couple of sweaters.
Okay, hurry up.
I'll get some champagne.
- Some champagne.
- Hey, son, I was just thinking.
- Things must be getting better for us.
- What do you mean, Pop?
Well, me and your mama could never afford a honeymoon.
And now look.
Me and you are going.
Get upstairs.
- That was real nice.
- Yeah.
A couple of days at the ocean will really do you good, Pop.
Sure will.
Wait a minute.
Don't sit down, son.
Come here.
- Look at this.
- What's this?
It's an ashtray.
I picked it up at the hotel where we stayed at.
- Souvenir.
- A souvenir?
It doesn't even have the name on it.
It says, "Help prevent forest fires.
" Well, you and I will know.
- And look here.
- Stationery?
A pen?
- You swiped all this stuff?
- Don't say "swiped.
" - Look.
- A towel?
- Why didn't you take the lamp?
- I couldn't get it in the bag.
But I got this.
A lightbulb.
You swiped all this stuff.
What'd you do that for?
Well, when they took all the It's supposed to be your wedding, and they took the wedding gifts back so I thought I'd pick you up a few things.
How about that?
A Bible?
Pop, you stole a Bible?
We got a Bible upstairs.
You don't need this.
Well, we'll use this one downstairs.
That way we'll have full coverage.
And besides, I didn't swipe the Bible.
It was in the honeymoon suite.
And look.
It's brand new.
People don't have time to read in the honeymoon suite.
It says right here in this book, "Thou shall not steal.
" And it also says in this book, "The meek shall inherit the earth.
" So you got start somewhere.
Well, many happy returns, son.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
- What's the matter?
- Sounds like feeding time at the zoo.
I can't concentrate with all that slurpin' going on.
- Can you hear yourself when you eat?
- No.
This is an operation between my mouth and my stomach and my ears ain't got nothing to do with it.
Slurp, slurp, slurp.
Man, the way you scrape and soak up food you ought to eat with a squeegee and a sponge.
I've been eating like this all my life.
Now, what's wrong with soppin'?
It's just not done anymore, Pop.
Now you eat a piece of toast, then you take a sip of coffee.
You eat, then sip.
Eat, then sip.
Now, that's how it's done.
It's all going to the same place.
I'm just cuttin' down on the number of trips.
Well, just try to be a little more quiet okay?
Eat.
Makes just as much noise this way.
Want me to go back to slurpin'?
Keep making me lose my place.
Where was I?
Oh, yeah.
It says here that the stock market tumbled sharply over a wide area yesterday but then recouped part of its lost ground in the final half hour of a somewhat more active session.
Dow Jones Industrials was off 4.8.
Transportation was off 1.7.
Utilities was off 1.3.
Uh-huh.
Everybody was off yesterday.
What was it, a holiday?
You don't understand.
Everything in the financial section has to do with us.
All the things that we deal in are right here.
They all fall under this one word: Commodities.
Is that the same as junk?
There's no use talkin' to you.
You just don't want to get ahead.
I wanna get ahead, but talking about big business ain't the way.
Okay, then let's hear your way.
Ladies and gentlemen and stockholders in Sanford and Son we'll now hear how to improve the financial situation of our corporation.
And here he is, the founder and president of our company and chairman of the board, Mr. Fred Sanford.
You got the floor, F.S. How would you like one across your lip?
All right, then let's hear it your way.
All right.
See, you have to start bringing in better stuff to sell.
Look out in the yard, the stuff you been bringing.
Now, there's junk, and there's junk.
But that stuff is junk junk.
If you don't like the merchandise coming in here, we'll switch places.
I'll stay here and run the yard and you go out there and do the pickin' up on the truck, all right?
You know I can't do that.
You know my arthritis.
I can't do no lifting.
Yeah, you can lift pretty good when it's going in your mouth.
Come in.
The door's open.
Oh, Kelly.
- Morning, Fred.
- How you feelin'?
Come on in.
- Hiya, Lamont.
- How you doing, Mr. Kelly?
- How about some toast and coffee?
- No, thanks.
Well, you can have a piece of toast, but you can't soak it.
Lamont don't like you to soak it 'cause that slurpin' interferes with him readin' about the commodities.
Well, thanks, Fred.
If I was gonna have it, I'd have to soak it.
I got no uppers.
I thought you went to the dentist.
I thought he was making you some new teeth.
He is, but first he's gotta make the gums.
He's making you gums?
What I mean to say, he's getting 'em in shape so they're nice and firm.
- See how firm they're gettin'?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Let me see, Kelly.
Yeah, come over here a little bit.
Yeah, they gettin' firm, Kelly.
Hey, Lamont, come on over here so you can get a good look at Kelly's gums.
- I already seen Kelly's gums, Pop.
- They look good, Kelly.
Well, thanks, but that's not what I come to talk about.
Fella come by my place, wanted to sell me some copper.
But you know I don't deal too much in metal.
- Would you fellas be interested?
- He's sellin' copper?
Yeah.
Scrap copper, yeah.
He's waitin' outside.
You interested?
Tell him I'll be right out there, Kelly.
- Fred?
- Yeah?
I'll show you the teeth as soon as I get 'em.
Okay, Kelly, you do that.
Ah, here it is.
Hey, what you doin'?
Are we buying copper?
That all depends.
This is exactly what I'm talking about, Pop.
Now, if we can make a nice turnover, we in business.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Mr. Sanford?
No.
I'm Mr. Sanford.
This is my son.
Mr. Kelly thought you fellas might be interested in buying some scrap copper.
How much you askin'?
Not too much.
Fact is, I'd like to sell it and have done with it.
I don't have a head for business.
Besides, I could use the money.
- How much do you want?
- Well, I got a couple hundred pounds.
I was thinkin' of maybe, uh, ten cents a pound?
- How much did you say?
- Ten cents.
Is that too much?
Oh, no, no, no.
It sounds like a fair price.
Listen, now I wanna go in and discuss this with my partner.
We're business partners, and we have to make all our decisions together.
And we'll be right back.
Come on, partner.
Did you hear that?
He's selling that copper for ten cents a pound.
I looked that up in the paper.
You know what it's going for?
Thirty-eight cents a pound.
Then why is he selling it to us for a dime?
Maybe he was gonna ask for more.
Did you see how I handled that deal?
I was cool, man.
I wasn't even interested.
I don't like his looks.
What's the matter with his looks?
What's his looks got to do with this?
He got them sneaky blue eyes.
We can make twenty-eight cents profit on every pound.
Why don't he know that?
Just 'cause he's white don't mean he's dumb.
- It's stolen, Lamont.
- I don't know, Pop.
Listen.
The guy is not in the business and you heard what he said.
He just wants some money.
He just wants to get rid of it.
I tellin' you it's stolen.
That's what it is.
- Stolen goods.
- Pop.
- All right, ask him where he got it.
- Okay, I'll ask him.
Just stay out of this and let me take care of it.
I'm the businessman.
You're gonna mess up the whole deal.
Listen, there's something I want to ask you.
It's - Is something the matter?
- Well, not exactly.
My partner Well, that is, my dad, he'd like to know where you acquired the copper.
Well, sure.
Be glad to tell you.
You see, this church that I'm a member of, they're tearing it down.
It's the Church of the Communal Soul.
You ever hear of it?
- As a matter of fact, I haven't.
- What are you folks, Baptist?
Greek Orthodox.
Well, what difference does it make?
We're all brothers, aren't we?
I ain't got no brother.
I got two sisters.
Well, I know you're not gonna believe this but they're tearing down our church to make room for a parking lot.
That's progress for you, isn't it, Mr. Sanford?
Plenty of room for automobiles but what are the poor worshippers supposed to do?
Learn how to kneel in the back of their car.
Well, anyway, when they were tearing down the church the minister said to me, he said, "Otto you been coming here longer than anybody else so you just take all the plumbing supplies.
" - Then it's all legitimate.
- Well, yeah.
What'd you think?
- What did I tell you?
- I could've had the organ, but no.
I said, "Let's give the organ to a home for senior citizens - for their community singin'".
- Hey, that was sweet of you, Otto.
Well, do unto others, I always say.
Isn't that what you always say?
No, I say a lot of other things.
You wanna hear some of them?
Listen, just pay him no attention.
I'm gonna go and discuss this thing with him and come out here and get the whole business deal straight.
- Excuse us.
- Okay.
Now, listen, don't louse up this deal.
We're gonna buy that copper.
It's stolen goods, I'm tellin' you.
It's stolen.
I mean it.
We'll all get caught, and me and you and Blue Eyes will go to jail only they'll put Blue Eyes in the new building.
Would you stop worrying and give me the 20 bucks?
I don't like this deal.
Something about it ain't kosher.
- Ain't what?
- Ain't kosher.
- Who'd you get word from?
- From Kelly.
Gimme that $20.
Well, I'm tellin you, I ain't got nothin' to do with it.
Stay out of it then.
I told you I'd take care of it.
- I know about this kind of business.
- Just leave me out of it.
Cash on delivery.
Oh, I can understand that.
That's just good business.
I'll go unload the stuff you just bought.
By the way, do you think you might be able to use any more copper?
I don't know.
I think we might be able to take some of it off your hands.
Well, I just might be able to help you.
I'll tell you what.
You meet me down at Dave's Diner tomorrow morning about 9:00.
I'm pretty sure I can get my hands on some more copper.
You know where Dave's is?
About ten minutes down on Adams.
It's kind of a handy place to meet.
I'll get the first load out of my car.
No, no.
Cash on delivery.
Yeah, you are a sharp businessman.
- We'll be waitin' for you.
- I'll be back.
Now, listen, Pop.
This is only the beginning.
Now, it has nothing to do with the $40.
Now, it's the fact that we're doubling our investment.
We're on our way, Pop.
I can see it now.
I can see it too.
People marching with placards saying, "Free the Sanfords".
Come on, Lamont.
Let's get outta here.
That guy ain't gonna show up.
Oh, he'll be here, Pop.
He's just a little late.
A little?
He said 9:00, and it's after 10:00.
Would you just relax and slurp some coffee?
I never did like this deal.
I was up all night worrying.
Did you hear me tossin' and turnin'?
No, I missed that part.
I came in on the snoring.
Morning.
Sorry I'm late.
That's all right.
We've just been here sittin' here talking.
Well, I stopped off to say good-bye to my minister.
I'm leaving.
You know what I've decided to do?
I'm gonna do missionary work.
Probably be going to Africa.
I'll be doing work among your people.
Not mine.
My people in St. Louis.
Hey, I got good news for you.
I was able to get more of that copper.
- Fantastic.
At the same price?
- Yeah.
Twenty cents a pound.
You mean ten cents a pound.
- Is that what I said?
- That's right.
If that's what I said, then that's what it is.
I'd rather cut off a leg than go back on my word, right, Mr. Sanford?
Right, Stumpy.
Well, you owe me another $20.
We can settle right here, then we'll load the stuff into your truck.
- It's out in the trunk of my car.
- Great.
- Let me buy your coffee for you fellas.
- Hey, thanks a lot.
You see that?
I told you he was nice.
Now give me the 20 bucks.
Lamont, you sure you want this extra copper?
We already made the deal.
It's too late to back out.
Would you give me the 20?
- Here you are.
- Bless you.
May I say it's been a pleasure doing business with you gentlemen.
- Well, let's go load that stuff up.
- Right.
Two, four, six.
Two, four, six, eight, nine.
What are you doing?
I'm measurin' six feet by nine feet 'cause that the size the jail cells are in the old building.
What are you doin'?
I'm covering up this copper so nobody can see it.
It's stolen goods.
Would you stop that?
The man told you where he got it from.
We bought some copper and we're not responsible for where it came from.
And besides, who's gonna come around here looking for stolen copper?
And that's all I'm gonna say on the subject, Pop.
I think you'll have a few more words to say now.
- What are you talkin' about?
- Police car just pulled up by the curb.
So that doesn't mean anything.
They're just sittin' in the car.
And see?
They're just gettin' out they're looking around and they're coming in here!
Oh!
My heart!
They got us.
They got us.
They got us with stolen goods!
Oh, they got us!
I'm going to lose the place of business, and I'm going to jail.
I'm going to die there of a broken heart.
Do you hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm comin' to join you, honey with numbers on my back.
Just cool it, Pop.
We gotta be cool.
We can't lose our heads now.
We just act like we playing checkers.
Now relax.
It's your move.
Come on in!
The door's open!
- Hi, Lamont, Fred.
- Hey, what a surprise!
We're just sitting down here, playing some checkers.
- How you feel, Smitty?
- I'd like you to meet my new partner.
This is Officer Swanhauser.
We do the rounds together.
- How you doing, Officer Swanhauser?
- How you feel, Swanee?
The reason Officer Smith and myself are paying this call is to issue a warning.
- A warrant?
- A warning.
It's come to the attention of the department that an as yet unidentified suspect is operating in this area and attempting to sell copper that has previously been burglarized and that said burglary may have been perpetuated by the suspect in question.
There's a dude trying to unload some hot copper that he snatched himself.
That's what I thought he said.
So until we apprehend the suspect in question the department advises that you refrain from all purchases of copper from any person or persons canvassing the area.
If you are approached, you're to notify the district police immediately.
Until this cat gets busted, be cool on copper.
And if he hits on you, contact your local fuzz.
Did you peep the dude that's been ripping 'em off?
Do we have a make on the suspect.
As far as we're able to ascertain, the suspect is a male Caucasian with no distinguishing physical characteristics.
He's a white dude.
Yeah, some of my best friends are white.
Well, we'll see you later.
We gotta get goin'.
Okay, listen, anytime you're in the neighborhood, just drop in.
We can play some checkers and stuff anytime you come by.
- You're always welcome here.
- Say, Fred?
What you got here?
Load of hot copper?
- We covered this stuff up because - Didn't wanna get it wet.
- It was gonna rain last night.
- Okay.
We gotta get goin'.
Come on.
Yeah, anytime you're in the neighborhood, drop in.
It was nice meeting you, Officer Swanhauser.
Bye, Swanee.
I knew I'd have a heart attack any minute.
Oh, I can't make it, Lamont.
It's the worst feeling I've had.
Oh, my heart is just thumping so hard.
Pop, this is a ridiculous time to have a heart attack.
- No, it ain't.
- Listen.
Listen to me.
We gotta sit down and we gotta figure this thing out.
Now, we're not gonna solve nothing by panicking.
We got to figure it out and figure on the best thing to do.
Then if you want to have a heart attack, it's all right.
Well, the first thing we oughta do is get rid of it.
I know we gotta get rid of it, but where?
Just take it somewhere and dump it.
Somewhere nobody can find it.
The ocean!
Pop, we can drive out to the beach and dump it in the water.
- I can't go to the ocean!
- Come on, you can make it.
- I ain't going to no ocean.
- You'll make it.
I might go, but I ain't gonna make it back.
Drop me off at Forest Lawn.
I ain't going.
Get in the truck.
Listen, I'll buy you some aspirins on the way to the beach.
I ain't gonna make it to the beach.
All right.
We got rid of the stuff and everything's been taken care of.
You happy?
Happy?
I got a truckload of copper at the bottom of the ocean.
I'm out of 40 bucks, and I'm sitting here with my dummy son.
I didn't know a black man could be so happy.
Listen to me.
I got us into this thing, but I also got us out of it.
And that is because I am cool.
Now, if there's one thing that I want you to learn, Pop it's to be cool like me.
That's something you haven't learned.
Nothing upsets me because I am cool.
- Get the door.
- I can't get the door.
You go.
Oh, it's Mr. Kelly.
Come on in, Mr. Kelly.
Hey, Pop, it's Mr. Kelly.
How you feeling, Mr. Kelly?
I just come over to borrow a pail of water.
What's the matter?
You out of water?
I don't know what it is, but none of my taps is working.
Hey, I'll get you some.
Funny.
You never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Oh, he's a darlin' boy.
Where would you be without him?
I don't know where I'd be without him, but I know where I almost was with him.
That's funny.
We ain't got no water either.
No foolin'.
I'm gonna go down to the basement and check the pipes.
You know what I bet it is?
I'll bet you it's a busted water main.
I bet you nobody in the whole block's got any water.
- I bet you're right.
- Oh, boy.
- I'm in trouble if I don't have water.
- Why, Kelly?
Well, you see, I gotta soak my gums in saltwater.
I didn't do it today, and now they're getting tender.
Let me see, Kelly.
Oh, they do look tender, Kelly.
You're gonna have to eat mush.
You have to mash it.
Yeah, and strain it and suck it through a straw.
Well, son, you find out what's wrong?
Find out the trouble?
What is it?
Now I know where that guy got all that copper from.
All our pipes, Pop.
He ripped out all our pipes.
All our plumbing is gone.
You mean the copper we dumped down the bottom of the ocean?
Those are our pipes?
And he pulled out our pipes and pulled Kelly's pipes out?
That's what he was doing down at Dave's Diner while we were waiting.
Taking our pipes out.
You big dummy!
"Don't worry, Pop.
I'm cool.
Just learn to be cool like me.
I'm cool.
" You big dummy.
You're not even a cool dummy.
You're just a big, ordinary, plain dummy, dummy.
Hello, is this the Ace Plumbing Company?
Yeah, this is Fred Sanford.
Sanford.
That's S-A-N-F-O-R-D period, speakin'.
Yeah, I wonder if you people could come over and do a little plumbing job.
Yeah.
We ain't got any water.
Yeah, I know why we ain't got water.
We ain't got any pipe.
- Okay.
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the plumbing company.
- Would you put that phone down?
I bought all that used pipe, and I'm gonna take care of this whole thing.
You don't know nothing about plumbing.
You ain't no plumber.
Are you kidding?
There's nothing to it.
All I do is just join all that pipe together hook it to the main valve, turn on the switch, and zap!
Water.
Now even an idiot would know that.
Well, in that case, maybe you could do it.
All right, then you do it, you're so smart.
You know I can't lift that wrench.
You know my arthritis.
You can't do nothin' but talk.
Everything around here, I do.
Are you kidding?
Who you think keeps this place clean?
I don't want to discuss it.
Listen to me.
I got the faucet turned on in the kitchen.
Now, I want you to come over here and stand here and tell me when the water comes on, all right?
All right.
And stay away from that phone!
- Pop, can you hear me?
- Huh?
- Can you hear me?
- Huh?
Can you hear me?
- Where are you?
- I'm right here!
- Right here?
- Yeah!
- I can hear you.
- Okay.
Is the water on?
Wait a minute.
I'll go look.
What?
I said I'll go and see if the water's on!
- What?
- I said okay!
- What'd you say?
- I said okay!
- Is the water on?
- Huh?
- What?
- Is the water running now?
Is it running Yeah, it's running now, you dummy!
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Smoking less, but enjoying it more.
- Hey, Pop.
- Lamont, you bring cigarettes?
Bring any what?
Did you bring cigarettes?
The smokes.
Did you bring 'em?
- Did you hear yourself just now?
- Yeah.
Did you bring the cigarettes?
No, I don't mean that.
I mean did you hear yourself coughing.
I heard you a block away.
It sounded like they was tearing up the streets.
And you want to know if I brought you some cigarettes.
Well, did you?
Did you bring them?
I told you to bring me cigarettes.
Yeah, I know you did, Pop.
But listen, I got a better idea.
On the way home, I passed something they call a breathmobile.
You know what a breathmobile is?
That's something you spray in your mouth so your friends don't turn away.
No, it's a mobile unit for taking chest X-rays and breathing tests.
- What's that gotta do with me?
- Everything, Pop.
Now, you gotta give 'em up.
You gotta give up cigarettes.
- For what?
- 'Cause they're killing you.
How long you been smokin' anyway?
Let's see, I started after I left school.
L- I was ten.
Ten?
That means you've been smoking for fifty-five years.
You know how much smoking that is?
Let me see if I can figure this thing.
Ten.
Let me see.
Now, a cigarette is three inches long.
Now, a pack of 20 cigarettes is 60 inches or 5 feet.
- Now, how many do you smoke a day?
- Two packs.
Two packs?
Pop, that's forty cigarettes.
Let me see, that's That's about ten feet of cigarettes multiplied by one year that's 3,650 feet of cigarette a year.
So what?
Three quarters of a mile every year for 55 years.
Pop, since you was 10, you smoked a cigarette 41 miles long.
That's real super king-sized, ain't it?
Forty-one miles.
You know You know what that's like, Pop?
That's like you smoked a cigarette from from here to Disneyland.
Hey, Pop, do yourself a favor.
Give 'em up.
Give 'em up?
I enjoy smoking.
Say, Pop, cigarettes will kill you.
Don't you believe me?
I believe you.
Killed a friend of mine in Durham, North Carolina.
- You see that?
- Got killed by a tobacco truck.
Truck ran over his nice, clean lung.
I was smokin' at his funeral, trying to relax.
I want you to get a chest X-ray and a checkup.
Now, it's free.
I ain't going.
I don't think you heard what I said, Pop.
I said it's free.
I can go to County Hospital and get some birth control pills free, but you don't see me runnin' around there, do you?
- I know what it is.
- What?
You scared.
That's what it is.
You're scared.
You're afraid to go down there.
I ain't scared.
Why are you so anxious for me to get an X-ray anyway?
You want them to find something wrong with me, don't you?
- What are you talkin' about?
- I saw it in one of them medical shows.

Why'd did you have go and tell her my real age for anyway?
I could've took her out.
She's pretty.
- Now, she's got TB.
- What?
Terrific body.
You're a dirty old man, you know that?
And I'm gonna be one till I'm a dead old man.
And anyway, she's closer to my age.
- I could have asked her for a date.
- Who's next?
- Why don't you ask her?
- Let me have your cards, please.
Right this way.
Now take your jackets off, please.
Wait a minute, honey.
What you doing?
- Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
- These will show on the X-ray machine.
Well, tell me.
Don't be snatching all over my stuff.
You want me to take my shirt and pants off too?
No, that won't be necessary.
I'll be with you in a moment.
And you made me change my drawers, dummy.
Would you go on in there and follow her.
- I ain't going in there.
- Would you go in there.
I ain't going in there with that old, ugly white woman.
Get in there!
Okay, everything's ready.
Who's first?
All right.
Right this way.
Now put your shoulders against the wall.
That's right.
Tuck it in.
I'll tuck it in if you tuck yours in.
Hey, Pop, look at this.
"Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease Association of Los Angeles County.
" Now, these are the results of our tests.
- "Fred Sanford.
" That's yours.
- I don't want it.
You open yours first.
You really are a silly old man.
Aha.
Here it is.
"Dear sir, we are happy to inform you that your recent chest X-ray is completely clear and shows no abnormalities.
" You see?
Now open yours.
- You open it.
- You really are chicken, aren't you?
Don't even wanna open your own mail here.
I'll open it.
Okay.
"Dear sir " Here it is.
"Your recent chest X-ray was unsatisfactory due to a technical fault.
An appointment has been made for you at the County General Hospital for a further X-ray.
" I got it.
I got it!
I got it, and it's all your fault!
You and that damn X-ray!
I done caught it.
I caught it from the X-ray machine.
Oh, Pop, you can't get TB.
From an X-ray machine.
Besides, it don't say you got it.
It says the test was unsatisfactory due to a technical fault.
That's what they say.
They just don't want to come out and tell you.
They just want to break it to you easy.
But I got it, that's for sure.
- I'm dying!
- Pop!
I'm dying!
I can feel myself getting weak.
You hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm coming to join you, honey.
Pop, would you quit that!
Now you're panicking.
Oh, Lamont, you're lookin' at a dead man.
You're lookin' at a dead man, and I'm lookin' at an orphan.
I'm dying.
If you have got it, a couple of months in a sanitarium will fix you right up.
Lamont, don't let them take me away, hear?
I want to die in my own bed.
Promise me you won't let 'em take me.
- I don't wanna go nowhere.
- Stop it.
You're talkin' foolish.
You got yourself all dead and buried and all it said was that the test was unsatisfactory due to a technical fault.
If you don't believe what I'm saying, take the letter and read it yourself.
- I need my glasses.
- Well, go get your glasses.
I won't need my glasses much longer.
Now, Lamont, when they lay me away, don't let them put my glasses on.
That's the way they buried my Uncle Henry.
He sure looked ridiculous, laying there in the box with his glasses on and his eyes closed.
Get over there and get those glasses.
There's nothing wrong with you.
The letter says the test was unsatisfactory due to a technical fault.
You're always making a mountain out of a molehill.
There's nothin' wrong with you.
I'm not gonna bother with you no more.
You done forced it on me.
What does it say?
Says, "Fred, you've had it.
- And you're a dead man.
" - Pop!
- It might as well say that.
- Would you read the letter?
When does it say you gotta go to the hospital?
- You're makin' a big deal.
- It says, uh - Hey, wait a minute.
- What?
This ain't mine.
This is yours.
See here?
"Lamont Sanford.
" Oh, come on.
They don't make mistakes like that.
Let me see this thing.
I'll straighten this right out.
"Lamont Sanford.
" I got it, Pop.
I got TB.
I got it, Pop.
I got TB.
I got consumption.
Oh, you ain't got nothin'.
It didn't say you have it.
It just said that it was unsatisfactory due to technical fault.
That's just what they tell you to try to break it to you easy.
They don't want to come out and tell you that you're dying.
- But I'm dying, Pop.
- You ain't dying.
You're a young fella.
Yeah, but listen.
L- I got this cough.
Cough over that way.
And I've been tired lately and out of breath.
- Well, you got give them up.
- I don't smoke.
I'm not taking about cigarettes.
I'm talking about women.
That's not it.
I know what it is.
You didn't take care of me when I was a kid.
You didn't give me enough milk.
When I was five, you gave me coffee.
It had milk in it.
It's all your fault.
This house was always damp.
Even my bed was damp.
Now, you can't blame that on me.
Say, Pop, I'm scared.
- I'm really scared.
- Well, don't come near me!
Don't come near me with that stuff!
That's stuff is catchin'.
But I'm your son.
Your own flesh and blood.
I don't care who you are.
Don't cough on me.
They don't need the both of us having it.
I may have enough trouble trying to run this place alone anyway.
I don't know how I'm gonna do it.
What a terrible thing to happen to a guy my age.
You?
What about me?
I'm the one who's sick.
But I'm the one who'll have to be here all alone.
Ain't nothin' in the world sadder than an old black man sittin' in a junkyard alone with no cigarettes.
I don't believe you, Pop.
Here I am sick, dying with TB and all you can think about is yourself.
You're a cold, heartless old man.
- Where you going?
- I'm going back to bed.
- You just got up.
- Yeah, I know, but I feel kinda tired.
I got to get all the rest I can, Pop, now that I'm sick.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Get you some rest.
I'll see you in the morning if God's willin'.
You're all right, son.
Ain't nothing wrong with you.
- You ain't got it.
- You think so, huh?
Sure.
But if you have got it, you got it from that damn X-ray.
Would you take that thing off.
Take off that stupid mask!
Well, I'm just trying to protect myself.
You're being ridiculous.
- Say, what is this?
- What's what?
This tape on the knife and the fork.
Oh, I didn't want to get 'em mixed up, so I labeled all your stuff.
All the stuff you eat with got a label on it.
See, I put labels on everything, see.
"F" is for Fred, and yours is marked "C".
- "C"?
- Yeah.
"Contaminated.
" You want me to go sleep in the yard in the back of the truck?
I don't think we have a cord long enough for the heater so you could be warm.
What's the matter with you?
You know I'm sick and you come out with a surgical mask and put tape on the knife and fork!
Don't you get excited.
You said you needed your rest.
Now stop getting excited and sit down and relax.
- Gee whiz.
- I guess you're right.
I'm not supposed to tire myself out.
Hey, Pop.
Do my cheeks look flushed?
Do my cheeks look flushed?
It's hard to tell.
You know you got your mother's skin.
But you look all right to me.
Ain't you gonna get dressed and go on out to work?
Go to work?
Pop, I got TB.
I can't go to work.
I'm sick.
Well, I thought the fresh air might do you some good.
You thought you'd get me out of here so you can have this house fumigated.
How much do they charge?
Well, I'm not going to work 'cause I gotta go down to the hospital to get my new X-rays.
Want to get this house fumigated.
Go to work and I'm sick with TB.
Say, Pop?
- Would you put this in the safe for me?
- What is it?
It's my will.
What'd you go and have a will made for?
You said yourself, they could kill that stuff in a few days now.
- Real fast.
- Yeah.
- But you never know.
- Yeah, okay.
Well, I got to be going.
I got to be at the hospital in an hour.
I got my shaving stuff and my pajamas in here.
I suppose they'll take me right to the sanitarium.
- So long, Pop.
- Well, so long, son.
And I'll come to visit you, if it ain't too far.
That'd be real nice, Pop.
Well, adios, old fellow.
So long, Pop.
So long, son.
Take care of yourself, hear?
"Last will and testament.
" "Dear Pop, by the time you read this, I might be dead unless you can't wait and you went and opened it already.
I leave all my worldly goods to you.
This includes my saving account and the Central Avenue Bank Christmas club and my half of Sanford and Son hereinafter referred to as the business.
I further leave you personally " One across your lips.
Couldn't wait, could you?
Just for that, you're getting nothing.
- But I thought you was in the hospital.
- Yeah, I was in the hospital.
But there's nothing wrong with me.
I'm fine.
- Your X-ray turned out all right?
- That's right.
It would've been okay the first time if I had remembered to take this off.
- What is that?
- The St. Christopher medal you gave me.
I've been wearing it so long, I forgot I had it on.
You're all right.
That's the main thing.
Welcome home, son.
Some welcome.
I come home and find you readin' my will.
Pop, you wasn't supposed to read this till after I was dead.
I knew you wasn't gonna die.
The minute you left, I was startin' to miss you.
But I'm glad you're home.
You want me to fix you some lunch, son?
No.
I'm bushed.
I didn't get no sleep, worrying about them dumb X-rays.
I'm going back to bed.
- Lamont.
- What?
- You can't go back to bed.
- Why?
I burned your pajamas.
That's all right.
I got another pair in the bag.
And I burned your sheets and pillowcases.
You burned my sheets and pillowcases?
Why didn't you just burn the room?
I didn't burn your room, but I burned your bed.
You burned my bed?
- Yeah, I burned your bed.
- Why?
Because I thought your bed might be contaminated.
Open this door, you old buzzard!
Open this I'll get you for this!
I'm gonna get you for this!
Come on in, son.
Watch that statue there.
Cost me a lot of money.
Come on in.
Yeah, put it right over here.
Lean it against the chair here.
That's it, that's it.
Pull it right on over there.
Don't trip the rug up.
Boy, I'm tired.
Why don't we rest a minute?
"This tag is not to be removed under penalty of law.
" They get you anywhere you go now, don't they?
Well, power to the people.

We were robbed.
Robbed.
See, I was in the kitchen, fixin' your supper.

And And they just They robbed us.
We were robbed.
My collection!
My porcelain and glass collection!
They took it!
Yeah, I tried to stop 'em.
I said, "Hey, don't take that!
That's my son's porcelain and glass collection.
It's fragile and valuable.
" - What'd you have to tell 'em that for?
- I didn't have to tell them that.
You had a sign in there sayin' "fragile and valuable.
" One of the guys read it.
He said, "Oh, let's take this fragile and valuable collection.
" I tried to stop 'em, but they took it.
Say, Pop, wasn't there something you could've done?
- Couldn't you have done something?
- What could I do?
There was four of them.
Four white men with stockings over their heads.
- They had stockings over their heads?
- Yeah.
- Are you sure they were white, Pop?
- I know they wasn't black.
You can't get no stocking over one of them big naturals.
And then what happened?
They slugged me on the back of the head.
- Let me put something on it.
- No, don't touch it.
It's too tender.
And then what happened?
I don't remember.
Oh, I remember seein' your mother comin' toward me in a white dress.
She said, "Come on and join me, honey.
" That took a lot of guts.
You know, you could've been killed.
Yeah, but I could've took two of'em.
But six?
I thought you said there were four.
Oh, oh, yeah.
Four.
That's how many it was.
Four.
We were robbed.
What are you looking for?
- The frying pan.
- They took the frying pan too?
- I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
- Yeah, look in the kitchen.
See what's missing out of the kitchen.
I hope they didn't take my pinto beans.
I found it, Pop.
It was in the kitchen on the stove.
And this is just the kind of evidence we need.
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna call the cops.
The cops!
What do you wanna call the cops for?
We don't need no cops around here hanging around.
- Don't do that.
- Pop, this isn't just a robbery.
Now this is assault with a deadly weapon.
Hello, Operator?
Listen.
Get me the police.
- Quick.
This is an emergency.
- A frying pan ain't no deadly weapon.
- Besides, I feel all right now.

And two of'em held me and one of'em beat me.
- What did the fourth man do?
- Huh?
Two men held you and one beat you.
That's three.
You said there were four.
What did the fourth man do?
Oh, he was the one that hollered, "Get him.
" Yeah.
He must've been the chief.
Mr. Sanford, uh do you think the injuries sustained during the altercation might require hospitalization?
Do you want to get your skull checked out?
No, I don't want to go to the hospital.
I can't waste three days.
- But it only takes a few minutes.
- It takes you a few minutes.
It takes us three days in the waiting room.
Very well.
Exactly what was taken?
Well, I was fightin' most of the time.
See, I fought all of them by myself.
But Lamont can tell you what was taken.
You tell them, Lamont.
Yeah.
They took some porcelain pieces and some French glassware.
It was worth over 200 bucks.
And it was fragile and valuable.
- See, I was in the kitchen - All right, Mr. Sanford, excuse me.
Would you check this for accuracy, please?
"Four unidentified Caucasian males entered premises of salvage business structure and committed assault on the lone occupant, rendering him unconscious then proceeded to remove from the premises collector items valued in excess of $200 with no information on route of suspects upon departing.
" - Right?
- Right.
Right.
We were robbed.
- Thank you very much, Mr. Sanford.
- I was in the kitchen Oh, Mr. Sanford I'm gonna tell them down at HQ what a brave man you are.
A victim your age taking on four assailants.
You might even get a citation.
- You hear that, Pop?
You're a hero.
- Get any money for that?
- Are you kidding?
That's an honor.
- Yeah.
That's right.
Sure is.
Well, you'll be hearing from us.
- Take it slow, Fred.
- See you later, Smitty.
So long, Officer Swanhauser.
- Say, Pop, you feel okay now?
- I'm kinda dizzy.
Kinda dizzy, son.
Listen, I want you to promise me that you'll never do nothing like that again.
- What?
- Risk your life for some glass.
- That was crazy.
- But that glass was valuable.
I know, Pop, but you're more valuable to me than glass.
You know, that's the nicest thing you've said to me in a long time that you like me better than glass.
I'll bet this is gonna be something you're gonna remember for a long time.
Yeah.
See, I was in the kitchen fixin' your supper and I was fixin' you some spare ribs and some pinto beans.

How you doin', Officer Swanhauser?
Say, you been down at the police station all this time?
Yeah, and they gave me a citation just like Swanee here said they would.
And he was nice enough to drive me home.
Hey, Swanee, read this the way you did down at HQ.
That's headquarters.
"Citation for bravery to Fred Sanford for his courage in his part in fighting crime in our city with appreciation from the Los Angeles Police Department.
" You can be mighty proud of your father.
I am proud of him.
That's the kind of spunk some of the kids today could use.
Like your old man.
He's got spunk.
Kids today don't have spunk.
- You don't think so?
- No.
All they wanna do is sit around and let their hair grow long.
They're spoiled.
Kids today don't have manners.
They don't have respect.
They don't have what your father's got.
- Spunk?
- Spunk!
- I got spunk.
- Well, I gotta be gettin' back.
Thanks a lot, Swanee, for driving me home.
- I sure appreciate it.
- Glad to do it, Sanford.
- Listen, you get this framed.
- Oh, yeah, I will.
Any long-haired kids come around, just show 'em your citation.
Right.
I'll show it to 'em.
Well, what are you gonna do now, Pop?
I think I'll go down to the pool hall and show all the fellas.
You know, my citation.
You wanna go with me?
No, no.
I gotta go deliver some stuff I sold this morning.
- Well, you know where I'll be.
- Yeah.
So long, Spunky.
"Los Angels Police Department citation for valor.

Police!
- Wait a minute!
No, it's me!
- Lamont, wait.
Let me help you.
- Is that you, Pop?
- Yeah, this is me.
- I feel dizzy.
The room is spinning.
- I don't know where I'm going, Pop.
- Come over here.
Where are you?
Are you still here?
Sit here on the sofa.
Tell me what happened.
Oh, we were robbed.
- Twice in two days.
- Robbed?
Yeah.
I think it was the same guys that was here yesterday.
You see, they do that sometimes.
They don't figure that you'll be expecting them back for a long time.
And then they come back, and they hit you real fast.
What guys?
What are you talkin' about?
The four white guys with the stockings over their heads, right?
Stockings?
Yeah.
The same guys that got you, remember?
- Oh.
Oh, them guys.
- Yeah.
Well, they came back, Pop.
And guess what they went straight for.
- What?
- Your piggy bank.
My piggy bank?
Oh, my piggy bank!
I had over $200 in here!
I know, Pop.
I tried to stop 'em.
I said, "Hey, don't take that.
My Pop's got over $200 in there.
" Two hundred dollars.
And then I grabbed the pot, and I started swinging.
Just like it happened to you, right?
- No, that's what That didn't happen.
- It didn't?
No, I mean I didn't have a pot.
I had a frying pan.
It don't make no difference.
You had a pan, I had a pot.
I tried to fight 'em off, Pop, but it was just too many of'em.
And it was hard for me to make a fist 'cause I caught a cramp.
- You got a cramp?
- Yeah, I caught a cramp.
I tried to fight 'em off, Pop, but they just overpowered me.
You believe me, don't you?
Y-Yeah, I believe you.
Yeah, well, I guess you better go on over here and call the police.
Here we go with another report.
I don't think I ought to I wonder if they'll give me a citation like the one they gave you.
- I don't what to talk - Well, go on and call the police.
I don't think you should ask me to And when you get 'em, tell 'em I found my porcelain all smashed up and broken in the refrigerator in the yard.
- But - I wonder how it got there.
It was an accident.
All right!
All right, I'll tell you.
I already know.
I already know.
You broke my porcelain and then you faked a robbery, you old faker.
Well, two people can play at that game.
- But But it was an accident!
- That's all right.
The money I got out your piggy bank will buy me a new collection.
That's the money I was saving for my heart operation.
You know, I was gonna get one of them heart transplants.
It took me a long time to save that money.
Give me my money!
- No.
I said no.
- No, I want my money.
I saved I said no, Pop.
Now get out of here.
Now you went and did it!
Oh, I might need that money tonight!
I've never had pains like this before!
Oh, this is the worst one I ever had, son.
Oh, it's the worse one.
This is the big one.
I'm dying!
You hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm coming to join you, honey!
Maybe that's Elizabeth.
- Mr. Sanford?
- No, that's not Elizabeth.
Too young and too white.
Nothing.
I was just talking to myself.
Can I help you?
I'm a reporter from a new magazine called People Today and we're doing a series entitled "What makes a hero"?
Well, you've been selected for doing a life story.
Oh, really?
Does that pay anything?
They usually pay $150.
- You think they might pay 200?
- Oh, I'm sure they will.
Well, come right in then.
Come right in here.
- Lamont, this lady's from a magazine.
- I already heard, Pop.
Yeah.
She's gonna do Sit right here, dear.
Warm enough for you?
Comfortable?
You say I can get 200 Uh, Lamont, why don't you take your 200 and go see if you can get you some new porcelain?
I'm gonna sit here with the lady and do my story for this 200.
We won't need you here at all.
Go right ahead, dear.
Now, where were you born, Mr. Sanford?
St. Louis, Missouri.
That's M-O period.
Yeah, see, my grandfather was the first one, you know that had that bravery and spunk.
He had it.
He was brave.
In fact, he was in that big battle between the Grays and the Blues.
The Homestead Grays and the St. Louis Blues.
That was just a little something I threw in there.
But you know, he was a captain in the Civil War in the cavalry.
Captain of the cavalry.
And one time, they were surrounded.
And the general said, "We're surrounded.
What should we do?
Should we turn back"?
My grandfather stood up in his stirrups and said, "No!
Ride on, ride on"!
That's the way that expression got started.
"Ride on.
" And then, see, my grandfather, he was in the Civil War and he was with Custer too.
It was just plain clumsiness.
That's how you broke my old collection.
You better not break my new collection.
Now, this is the way you did it.
This is the dumb way you did it.
Yeah.
That's the dumb way it happened.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
I'm sorry, Darlene.
Listen, I thought my dad cleaned that stuff up.
Well, this is it.
Home, sweet home.
You like it?
- Yeah.
Well, it's different.
- Yeah.
Yeah, you know, actually, this is part of the business establishment.
You see, the living quarters are upstairs.
Yeah.
You'll find that a lot of people are doing that nowadays combining their professional business with their homes.
It's very smart, tax-wise.
Dad and I are in the commodities game.
I thought you were in the junk business.
Well, you see, that's just the common name for it.
Now, you know, in the trade, we refer to it as "commodities.
" - Oh, I see.
- Yeah.
I'd take you upstairs and show you the upstairs living quarters but Dad's up there asleep now, and we don't want to bother him.
See, his room is done in Louis the XIV and mine is kind of Swedish modern, you know.
Oh, this is more like it.
Yeah.
Just you and me.
Hello, Lamont.
I thought I heard you come in.
Oh, hi, Pop.
Pop, this is Darlene Edwards.
Darlene, this is my dad, Fred Sanford.
That's S-A-N-F-O-R-D period.
Say, Pop, I thought you were asleep.
Now, you know I can't ever sleep till you come home.
Okay, well, I'm home now, so you can go to sleep.
Hey, what's that around your neck?
You got a sore throat?
This happens to be an ascot.
Well, if you gargle with some warm saltwater, you'll get rid of it.
- Well, good night, Pop.
- Yeah.
- Where'd y'all go, to a movie?
- Yeah, we went to a movie.
I was watching a movie here on TV.
A horror movie.
A scientist dug up a mummy And he brought it back to life and fell in love with her.
- Now, isn't that disgusting?
- Yeah, right.
It's all right to fall in love with somebody older than you are.
But 3,000 years?
Geez!
- Well, good night, Pop.
- Good night.
- Night, Miss, uh, Miss, uh - Edwards.
Edwards.
Yeah, Edwards.
Is your father in the poultry business?
No.
No, he isn't.
I used to buy my chickens from a guy named Edwards.
- Clarence Edwards.
You remember him.
- No, I don't remember, Pop.
Yeah, I had to stop getting my chickens from him.
- Yeah, he sold me a bad one.
- Oh, really?
Yeah.
He sold me a chicken that died before he could kill it.
You know, everything was wrong with that chicken.
Know what's wrong with him?
He had a bad heart, bad liver, bad kidney - Well, it's gettin' kind of late, Pop.
- And a bad gizzard.
It's getting late, you know.
It's kind of late now.
- Yeah.
Okay, son.
Night.
- Good night, Pop.
- Night, Miss.
- Good night.
Say, uh, Pop?
Would you mind turning out the light, please?
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I thought I'd fix me something hot to drink.
It help me sleep.
You folks want anything?
No, we don't want anything.
Well, I'm gonna have me a hot tea.
Yeah.
You folks sure you don't want any?
Positive, Pop.
Would you just go have your tea?
I hate to waste a bag on one cup.
You know, you can get three cups out of one bag.
Yeah, right.
Right, Pop.
I'll leave the bag on the sink in case you change your mind.
Okay.
Just have your tea, all right?
Okay, son.
I'll have me some tea.
You better not start.
You'll only quit when he comes through again.
I wasn't gonna start nothing.
I didn't want my motor turned off completely.
You know what, Darlene?
You really knock me out.
- I do?
- Oh, yeah.
You got me right in the palm of your hand.
I'm yours, mind and body.
- Oh, no.
- Well, he's just singing.
I know, but he makes me nervous, knowing he's in there.
Would you just forget about him?
Honeysuckle rose I don't buy sugar You just a I got my tea.
- Great.
- I put some applejack in mine.
You can do the same thing, but it make you sweat.
- Well, good night.
- Good night, Pop.
- Night.
- Good night.
Hey, how did Jimmy Durante used to say good night?
Night, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are.
Inka dinka dinka dinka dink a dinka doo - Say, Pop?
- I know.
Put the light out.
Thank you.
Inka dinka dinka dinka dinka doo Well, I think we're finally in the clear now.
You know what you oughta do?
Move out.
Get a place of your own.
Well, that's a good idea, Darlene, but I don't know if I can do that.
My old man is getting old, and he kind of depends on me.
I know, but you have no privacy this way.
Well, we have now.
We had to wait a little bit, but I think it was worth waitin' for.
'Cause now it's just you and me.
Well, if that don't beat all!
- Here he comes again.
- Freeway Freddy.
Hey, Lamont, you wanna hear something funny?
That hot tea made me hungry.
- You folks care for anything?
- No, thank you, Pop.
I'm gonna have me some eggs.
Well, if you change your mind, just call your order in to old Fred the short order cook.
Yeah.
Scramble two and a side of bacon!
Order of toast!
Heavy on the butter!
Comin' up!
Every honeybee Oh, Lamont, this is getting ridiculous.
Just wait a minute, Darlene.
Listen, I'll get this thing settled right now.
Now just come over here and sit down, and I'll take care of the whole thing.
It just takes a couple of words, and I'll straighten it out, okay?
Now just wait there.
Will you shut up!
What's wrong with you?
I'm just fixing something to eat!
Just try to keep it down, for crying out loud!
Why don't you go on back out there?
Don't come in here.
Well, I hope you're satisfied.
She left.
She did?
Why did she leave?
What did you do to her?
What did I do to her?
Pop, this whole thing is your fault.
Now, you know that.
Who me?
- What did I do?
- You know what you did.
Every time I bring some chick home, you find some way of lousin' it up.
You know that's not true.
When you bring a girl home I go upstairs or go in the kitchen and shut the door.
Yeah, with your eyeball pressed up against the keyhole.
Are you kidding?
I wouldn't waste my time, watching an amateur like you.
I can see more sex on the 6:00 News.
Well, if I am an amateur, it's 'cause I never get no practice.
- You're always in the way, Pop.
- Are you kidding?
I lost another one tonight, thanks to you.
Now, don't blame me 'cause you can't make it with girls.
- Maybe they don't like you.
- Yeah, they dig me, all right.
But I'll never get no place, hangin' around here.
Darlene was right.
I got to get a place of my own.
What are you talking about?
It's the only way, Pop.
I don't have any privacy here.
And it's ridiculous anyway.
A 30-year-old man still living at home.
I got to get a place of my own.
But you can't leave.
We got a business.
What about the business?
- We still got the business.
- Yeah, but I'll be here alone.
Old Fred, the lonesome coordinator.
I'll see you every morning when I come to work.
What about tonight?
What if I have a heart attack and have to call the doctor?
You know I can't dial the phone on account of my arthritis.
Would you cut that out, Pop?
You're not gonna have no heart attack.
You'll be nice and cozy here with your newspapers and your TV.
And anyway, my mind is made up.
This is something that I got to do.
- So I'm going.
- Okay.
- Okay, I'm ain't gonna stop you.
- Good.
- You want to go, go.
- I'm going.
- I know you got your mind made up.
- That's right.
But, but listen, son.
How would it be if I went with you?
Then what's the point of me leaving, Pop?
Don't you understand that it's you I'm trying to get away from?
Oh.
I see what you mean.
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
Are you staying here tonight?
Yeah, I'll stay here tonight.
I'll look for a place tomorrow.
That's good, because in case I have an attack you'll be here so you can dial the phone for me 'cause I can't dial on account of my Your arthritis.
I know.
- Your arthritis.
- Night.
Good night.
Come in this world alone, and you go out alone.
That's just the way it is.
You raise your kids, and when you get old enough for the kids to help you then they go and leave.
Let's see now who's gonna be the lucky lady to start the ball rolling.
Darlene.
She's the one responsible for this whole thing.
Well, it's an entirely different ball game now.
Hello, Darlene?
Hey, baby, what's happening?
This is Lamont.
Hello?
Hello!
Darlene!
If at first Ah, Joan!
I'm gonna callJoan 'cause I'm all alone.
Hello, Joan?
Bet you'll never guess who this is.
It's Lamont.
Lamont Sanford.
Yeah, I knew you'd remember.
Say, Joan, I was just wondering if maybe you and me could get together tonight.
You know, I got my own place and everything now, and I Well, can't you give yourself a facial some other time?
Well, how long do you have to leave that stuff on there?
No, that's all right.
Just forget about it.
It's okay.
Might as well wait till her skin clears up.
Joyce.
CallJoyce and rejoice!
I'm gonna callJoyce 'cause I know Joyce ain't got nothing to do.
Hello.
Can I speak toJoyce, please?
Who is this?
Oh, no, I didn't know she was married.
No, no, no, no, no.
No messages.
Never mind who's calling.
Well, here it is.
I hope you like it.
Yeah.
It sure smells good.
I sure appreciate you coming around to help me.
Man, what a rump roast.
Thank you.
You know, I haven't see you since Joe had the accident at the foundry.
Let's see now.
How long has that been?
How long you been a widow?
It's been a long time.
Nearly six months.
You must be kind of lonely.
Have you thought about getting married again?
Yeah, I thought of it, but I'm kind of particular.
Have you ever thought of remarrying?
Yeah, I thought about it, but I'm kind of particular too.
- You are?
- Yeah.
I guess we're just two particular people.
- That's nice.
- Hey, listen.
You should've been coming around before.
Well, I didn't know how your son would feel about it.
I didn't want him to think I was trying to take the place of his mother.
See, now there's the difference.
He can never have another mother.
But I got to have another mama.
And now that Lamont's gone and moved and got his own place you can come around anytime you want to.
You really want me to?
I sure do, Ernestine.
- Let's drink a little toast to that.
- All right.
I saw this in a movie once.
Hold it now.
Here we go, like this.
Hello.
Hey, Peg.
Where are you?
Well, this is a fine time to tell me you can't come!
Well, listen, I've got dinner cooking and everything.
I got the whole placed fixed up here.
Well, what happened?
Oh, no, listen, I'm really sorry to hear that.
No, I'm really am.
But can't you come anyway?
No, I'm not being selfish.
Listen, I understand.
What I don't know is why you have to go to the chapel tonight.
The body will still be there tomorrow.
Your uncle's not going anyplace.
No, it's all right.
No, I understand.
Some other time.
Bye.
- I'm coming!
- Open the door!
Hold on, will ya?
What took you so long to You're not even dressed.
What's the matter with you?
I got to bed late last night.
What's this?
Well, it was too late to clean up.
She wanted to, but I told her forget about it.
Man, what a rump roast.
Who's she?
She?
That's the she that was here last night.
Joe Crawford's widow.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- Ashamed?
What are you talkin' about?
What's wrong with having company?
How you doing with your privacy?
Everything's fine, Pop.
You know.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
That's the best thing you ever did, going and getting your own place.
- Smartest move I ever made.
- Yeah.
I thought I was too old for this kind of carrying on.
Say, you know what Ernestine calls me?
Ready Freddy.
Who's Ernestine?
I told you she was here last night.
Man, what a rump roast.
Well, I gotta go to work, Pop.
I'll see you later on today.
Now, listen, if you wanna come by and have dinner with us tonight - you're welcome.
- No, I got big plans for tonight, Pop.
- Got them chicks lined up, ain't you?
- Oh, yeah.
Lined up and waitin'.
Just one big parade.
Yeah.
Ready Freddy and Prompt Lamont.
Well, finally.
Why, hey, I didn't know you had your own place.
I tried to tell you, baby, when I called you.
You like it?
I love it.
It's It's really you.
- I think so too.
- Did you do it all yourself?
Well, most of it.
Just a few things I picked up here and there.
You know, at Hughes Market and at the Akron.
Well, you have very good taste.
Yeah, I think so.
- Sit down, my dear.
- All right.
I'll just put on a little mood music.
Oh, that'll be nice.
A little Chico Hamilton.
- Who's that?
- Oh, just forget about it.
It's probably somebody at the wrong door.
All right, that's it.
I do not allow visitors of the opposite sex after 11 p. m. - What kind of place you think this is?
- Just a minute!
That means you, miss!
Out!
You just can't come busting in here, telling people what to do.
Oh, yes, I can!
Did you read the rules of the house?
The rules clearly state that there will be no visitors after 11 p. m. - No visitors of the opposite sex.
- Well, I paid you the rent!
Not anymore, lover boy.
Well, just a minute, sister.
You can't come in here, spittin' on my candle.
Pack your things and get out!
I guess I told her.
Say, Darlene Who is that?
That you, Lamont?
- Oh.
Hiya, son.
- Hey, Pop.
- I didn't know you was coming home.
- Where you been?
I've been out on a date.
I'm so tired.
Say, you movin' back home?
No, I just came by to see how you was doin', you know.
Oh.
I sure wish you moved back home, son.
I need some protection.
You know, these women drive me crazy.
It's one big parade.
Night and day, day and night.
That's the way it's been, huh?
You know how it is when you got your own place.
- That's the way it is, all right.
- Yeah.
They just won't leave you alone.
Just after you all the time.
All the time.
All the time, Pop.
That's right.
I'm too old for this carrying on.
Why don't you move back home, son?
- What about my privacy, Pop?
- If you want to bring a girl in I won't bother you, I promise, okay?
Well, as long as you put it that way - I'll come back.
- Great.
Good, then let's celebrate.
We'll have a little nightcap.
I got some imported wine that Ethel left last night.
- Ethel?
Who's Ethel?
- That's Bernard Patterson's widow.
Say, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Well, you won't have to worry about that no more, son because after last night Ready Freddy ain't too steady.
Yeah, yeah.
You know what I like about you, Darlene?
You're willing to forgive and forget.
But you don't have to worry about a thing, my dear.
This is an entirely new situation that we're about to embark upon.
- Oh, it is?
- Yes.
- Where's your father?
- Forget him.
He's upstairs sleeping.
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yes.
- Sweetheart, you know what?
- What?
I'm hungry.
Well, there's some cold chicken in the refrigerator.
- Would you like to have that?
- Anything.
And we could have some cold Chablis.
It's a very interesting dry white wine that goes well with just about anything and then I'll come back out here and just Don't go away.
Be right back.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
- You want some more coffee?
- What?
- Coffee.
- Is that what I was drinking?
I thought it was tea.
You knew it was coffee.
Pop, you make your coffee so weak, it tastes like tea and you make your tea so strong, it tastes like coffee.
I think you invented a new drink teafee.
- You mean you don't like it.
- Well, what is it?
Is it instant, percolator or drip?
It's instant, cooked in a percolator and served to a drip.
Nobody's got to tell me this is the first of the month.
Look at these bills.
The drugstore, the grocery store, gas, electric, telephone.
- What am I gonna do with all of them?
- Put 'em back in the mailbox.
- Brilliant.
How'd you think of that?
- You asked me.
But I expected an intelligent answer.
And I gave you one.
Put 'em back in the mailbox.
Look at this.
"Repeated requests for payment have not been answered.
"We have, therefore, turned this over to a collection agency for repossession of the items purchased.
The Luau Layaway Furniture Company.
" Luau?
That's where we bought all our stuff from.
The TV and the refrigerator.
Everything.
And they're gonna come and take it back.
They can't take away my TV.
I won't ever be able to find out if Mickey and Laura got a divorce.
- What are you talking about?
- Mickey and Laura.
Days of Our Lives.
See, Mickey and Laura are getting a divorce.
See, Laura wants to marry Mickey's brother, Bill.
But Mickey don't wanna give up his son Michael to Bill even though Michael is Bill's son.
But Bill don't want Laura without Michael even though Mickey is willing to give up Laura.
That's why I got to know if Mickey and Laura are getting a divorce.
- Who?
- Mickey and Laura.
Sanford and Son is falling apart and you're talking about Mickey and Laura.
Don't you realize they're coming in here to take everything out of here.
- They ain't gonna take it.
- I just read you the letter.
- You never received the letter.
- What?
Put it back in the mailbox.
Just look at this.
Gas.
"Final Notice.
" Electric.
"Final Notice.
" Telephone.
"Final Notice.
" What's with all these final notices?
Haven't you been paying the bills?
The bills come on time, don't they?
The bills come on time, but there's been a slight delay in the money.
That's what I get for leaving you in charge of running this place.
You don't know how to take care of nothing.
Listen, son, when I got the money, I pay the bills.
And when I ain't got no money, there's only one thing left to do.
- I know.
- Put 'em back in the mailbox.
Don't you understand, Pop?
They're gonna sue us.
They ain't gonna sue.
They just say that to scare you.
Yeah, well, I'm scared.
As a matter of fact, I'm scared out of my pants.
Listen.
If I'd have been scared out of my pants every time I'd been threatened to be sued I'd have spent my whole life in nothing but some drawers.
Just Just look at this.
The drugstore, 28 dollars.
How'd you ever run up a bill of 28 dollars at the drugstore?
Let me see that.
- I need my glasses.
- Get your glasses.
You been in my drawer messin' around?
You got my stuff I keep my stuff arranged neat.
You got my Never find my glasses.
People go in your drawer.
I need these here.
Stay out of here.
These are all the things I need.
You know what I mean?
Mineral oil, epsom salts, Pluto Water.
That's how I take care of myself.
- You're a regular doctor, aren't you?
- I'm not a doctor, but I'm regular.
I don't understand you, Pop.
I work like a fool out there.
And I bring the money home.
Haven't you been keeping a budget?
What good is a budget?
To know if you've got enough money to pay your bills.
The budget tells you everything that you need to know.
I can put my hand in this pocket right here and that tells me everything I need to know.
If there ain't no money in there, then the budget is in serious trouble.
Do you realize that we got bills here that run over 200 dollars?
Then we're in serious trouble.
- Where are you going?
- To ask these people for more time.
This is the most important bill that we got.
The Luau Layaway Furniture Company.
They've already turned this thing over to a collection agency.
They're gonna be the first ones to give us trouble.
What do you wanna call them for?
They want some money, not conversation.
Well, you're the person that keeps all the money in this family.
- What does that look like?
- An empty pocket.
That's why I said put 'em back in the mailbox.
The phone is dead.
Everybody gotta die sometime.
You go in the kitchen and check the water and gas and I'll see if they done turned off the electricity.
- Well?
- Water's on.
Gas off.
We'll be hungry, but we'll be clean.
I'm going upstairs and fill up the tub with water before they turn that off.
See who that is, but don't let 'em in.
No matter what they say, don't let 'em in.
You got that?
- Got it.
- All right.
Mr. Sanford?
I have a summons for Fred Sanford.
- You're Mr. Sanford, aren't you?
- No speak English.
Oh, you speak Spanish.
What are you talking about?
- You are Mr. Sanford, aren't you?
- No speak English.
Come on.
Come on, Mr. Sanford.
Take it.
Man, get your arm out of my house.
- Who is that, Pop?
- Some guy with a summons.
- Well, don't take it.
- I ain't.
We don't want it!
Well, I'll just tell them it's been delivered and put it in your mailbox.
He got more sense than you.
That's what I been telling you.
I been telling you all morning, put it back in the mailbox.
It's no good unless it's been delivered to the person that it's supposed to be delivered to in person.
- That was clever.
- Yeah.
Your turn.
Okay, okay, I'll just wait out here until you come out.
Yeah, you gonna be waiting a long time.
If I was you, I wouldn't be waiting out there that long in this neighborhood.
Get your hat brought to the hospital.
Say, Pop, it looks like he's gonna stay for a while.
He's eating his lunch.
They got us trapped.
But that's all right.
We gonna out-wait 'em, just the two of us.
Yeah.
I got a idea.
Go to the door and make some noise and get his attention.
- And then I'll sneak out for help.
- That's terrific.
I saw it in a movie once.
Randolph Scott and his wife surrounded in a mountain cabin.
Indians all the way around 'em.
Arapaho, Sioux, Cheyenne.
And Randolph Scott say, "Honey, you go for help and I'll hold 'em off.
" He took out both guns and started shooting all over the place.
And his wife came back a little while later and had 10,000 Texas Rangers.
You think they'll all fit in this living room?
You know what I mean.
You draw their attention and I'll take the bills and go see if I can get somebody to loan us the money.
- I got a better idea than that.
- You have?
We go down in the basement and get a couple of shovels and we'll start digging a tunnel.
We'll dig a deep tunnel all the way down into the ground up through the sewer pipe and out into the street.
I like your idea better than I like mine.
- I thought you would.
- I'll take the bills with us.
And once we get out into the street, I can put 'em back in the mailbox.
- Is he still out there?
- Yeah.
Looks like he's gonna be there for a little while.
- Is that all the food we got?
- It's all I could find.
Can of pork and beans and a can of zucchini.
- And that's it, huh?
- That's it.
I can't even get to the market with him out there.
So you can have a little pork and beans now and a little zucchini later or a little zucchini now and a little pork and beans later.
Or you can have a little pork and beans and a little zucchini now or a little zucchini and a little pork and beans later.
Or if you like the pork and beans, you can have them and I'll take the zucchini, or I can take the pork and beans if you like the zucchini, and I'll just keep these.
So what will it be?
The zucchini or the pork and beans?
Have you forgotten we have no way of heating the food?
Well, in that case you can have some cold pork and beans now and some cold zucchini later.
- Or you can have - Will you stop that.
Open up!
I got a court order!
He's not here.
He went to a junk convention in Malibu.
Yeah, he went as a alternate delegate.
I'm from the Hamlin Collection Agency and I've got an order to repossess some furniture from the Luau Layaway Furniture Company.
- Now, open up.
- You must be out your mind.
Then I'm gonna have to force my way in.
Yeah, and you'll be in a lot of trouble.
Yeah, you'll be in a lot of trouble 'cause we got a lot of friends in Washington, D.C. That's right.
- We have?
- We must have.
It's 80% black.
Yeah.
That's right.
Then I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna do down to the Marshal's office and get me some deputies.
And if you don't open up, we're gonna force our way in.
Well, you just go right ahead, smart guy.
- Okay, I'll be back.
- We'll be waiting for you.
- They ain't coming back.
- I wouldn't say that, son.
They always come back.
I saw it in a movie once on the late, late show.
Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney and Wallace Beery trapped in a mountain cabin.
FBI agents had them surrounded.
Edward G. Robinson say And James Cagney say "They won't be back.
I know they're not coming back.
" Then he rushed out the door and got caught in a crossfire of machine guns.
Edward G. Robinson say And Wallace Beery say All of a sudden, James Cagney say, "They got me, dirty rats.
They got me.
" See?
That was the name of the picture.
"They Always Come Back.
" I don't believe you.
Here you are talking about some old dumb movie and we stuck here in this house without no gas, no heat no electricity and no food.
We got food.
We got pork and beans and zucchini.
What would you like?
The cold pork and beans or the cold zucchini?
Just keep it all.
I just wanna get some rest.
I don't know how you can think about resting at a time like this.
You got good zucchini here.
It's some good stuff in here.
Look.
"Dried celery, citric acid dried garlic black pepper, sweet basil.
" Lots of good things in here.
Son, I Son?
Well, if you wanna sleep What was that?
- That crunch.
I heard a crunch.
- I didn't hear no crunch.
- Are you eating something?
- I ain't eatin' nothin'.
You are eating something.
You're eating crackers.
I ain't eatin' nothin'.
Let me hear you whistle.
I don't believe you.
Here I am ready to eat cold beans and zucchini and you sitting over here eating all the good stuff that you got hoarded away.
I ain't hoarding nothin'.
I found these in my pocket.
I had some soup down at the diner last week.
They been in my pocket a week.
Here.
You take 'em.
I don't want nothing from you.
At a time when we're supposed to stick together you pull a rotten stunt like this, and my own father.
Well, don't yell at me.
Yell at that guy out there blockin' the market.
He's not the one that got me into this thing.
You did.
And it's all because you don't know how to take care of no business around here.
Who don't know how to take care of business?
Can you do better?
- A six-year-old kid could do better.
- Why don't you get a six-year-old kid?
- Because I'm stuck with you.
- Is that what you are, stuck?
- Stuck.
- Well, you won't be stuck much longer.
Any day now, I'll be going to join your mother.
Don't start that again.
Then you can get a six-year-old kid to help you.
Then it won't be Sanford and Son no more.
It'll be Big Dummy and Little Dummy.
Hey, Sanford, open up!
I got two deputies with me.
And if you don't open up, we're coming in.
Big Dummy, huh?
I've had it with you.
I'm letting them in.
Let 'em in.
Come on in, everybody.
The place is yours.
Now, that's better.
I'm certainly glad to see that you've come to your senses.
- Mr. Fred Sanford?
- I'm Fred Sanford.
I just got back from Malibu.
Sanford, I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but it's my job.
Now, let's see.
They said there was one television set.
- Yeah, that must be it.
- Wait a minute.
You can't take my TV.
I'll never be able to know if Mickey and Laura got a divorce.
Yeah.
Mickey and Laura are getting a divorce but Mickey don't wanna give up his son Michael to Bill even though Michael is Bill's son.
- Bill don't want Laura.
- One refrigerator.
You can't take my refrigerator.
That's where I keep my applejack.
There's nothing in the world worse than warm applejack and no TV.
Two beds.
I guess those are upstairs.
Wait a minute.
You can't take my beds.
You want me to sleep on the floor?
I got arthritis.
Yeah, I know.
- Just a minute.
Can I talk to you?
- Come here, Officer.
Now, you a brother.
You gonna take our stuff?
What can I do, brother?
It's my job.
Well, why don't you get a respectable job?
You could get a job somewhere down at the post office or in the car wash.
Sorry, man.
Can you give me some sort of arrangement here?
- We could pay you five dollars a month - I'm sorry.
It's too late for that now.
You should've thought of that sooner.
- Wait.
I can't let you upstairs.
- Let me by, Mr. Sanford.
- Come on, Mr. Sanford.
- The beds aren't made.
- Will you let go of me.
- You can't go upstairs.
Don't go upstairs.
Take your hands off me.
What are you doing?
- He pushed me.
- But I didn't do anything.
He pushed me down the steps.
He pushed me.
I know it's something broken.
Son, he pushed me down the steps.
- Son, it's broken.
- I didn't do anything.
- He fell.
It wasn't my fault.
- You threw an old man down the stairs.
No, I did not.
He slipped on the carpet.
- You fellows saw that, didn't you?
- We didn't see anything.
- We were up in the bedroom.
- He tried to kill me, son.
Think I'll ever walk again?
Oh, son, my back.
What is it, Pop?
Is it your knee?
No, it's my back.
I might never walk again.
- You butcher!
- Listen.
It was an accident.
- Why don't you get him a doctor?
- Son, it's too late for a doctor.
I think you better call Reverend Trimble.
I'm gonna see that they lock you up for manslaughter.
Wait a minute.
The man fell.
I had nothing to do with it.
He fell because you pushed him.
It wasn't enough that you tried to take all his furniture away.
- But you tried to kill him.
- Yeah.
He tried to kill me.
You hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm coming to join you, honey, with a bad back.
Just take it easy, Pop.
Listen.
You fellows know I didn't push him.
He fell.
You'll back me up on this, won't you?
I don't know.
Sounds like he's got a pretty good case.
Oh, yeah?
Look, you know your people better than I do.
- What do you think that I should do?
- You want some real good advice?
If I were you, I'd get out of this neighborhood before it gets dark.
I think I'd better try to make a deal with him.
- That's a good idea.
- All right, you guys wait outside.
But don't leave without me.
Listen, Sanford.
I'm terribly sorry that you got hurt.
How about if I don't take any of this stuff?
And I'll try to get you a little extension.
Did you hear that?
You're in a lot of trouble.
I'm gonna sue you for every penny that you got.
I'm gonna take your collection agency away from you.
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Take it, son.
Take it so you'll have enough money to bury me with.
Don't worry, Pop.
You'll be sorry you ever set foot in this house, buster.
Throwing an old man down the stairs.
You think I'll ever walk again?
Don't worry, Pop.
We'll wheel you into the courtroom and you can testify from the wheelchair like that dude Ironside.
Yeah.
I saw Ironside last night on television.
And he was in his cabin surrounded by criminals - Pop.
- Now, look I'm sorry that this had to happen.
But we don't have to go to court over this, do we?
I'm sure we can settle it some other way.
No chance.
It's out of my hands now.
It's up to a judge to decide this.
Just look at my poor father.
He'll probably become a vegetable.
Yeah.
An old dried-up zucchini.
All right.
It's forgotten.
- Hey, man, don't hit me.
- I didn't mean I bet I can give you one across your lip.
On top of that, I'll give you a hundred dollars to take care of your little doctor bills.
Are you kidding?
A hundred dollars for a vegetable?
All right, make it a hundred and fifty.
Feel like my ribs coming through my heart.
- Two hundred.
- Take it, son.
Take the two hundred.
I don't need a private room.
Just put me in a ward.
Make that out to me so I can sign it.
- He'll probably never write again.
- Never.
Never write again.
There you are.
Two hundred dollars.
Get your father a doctor and let him have a nice examination.
You don't have to tell us what to do.
We know.
You just signed this check and it's over for you but it's just starting for us the trips to the hospital, the clinic.
Tomorrow you'll be back in the collection business but my old man will be an old cripple parked in front of his TV set.
Yeah.
An old crippled zucchini watching Days of Our Lives.
- I don't know what to say.
- Why don't you start with "good night.
" Good night?
Is it night already?
I better get out of here.
- It's okay, Pop.
They're gone.
- They gone?
Yeah.
- We back in business.
- You were terrific.
- Yeah?
- You were terrific.
What a performance.
- I was pretty good, wasn't I?
- Yeah.
Hey, 200 dollars.
We can pay off all our bills and get everything turned on again.
- Yeah, from rags to riches.
- Yeah, we're back on Easy Street.
Two happy people Sanford and Son.
Promise me that you're really gonna try to watch the budget this time.
What do you mean, trying to watch the budget?
That's how we got into trouble in the first place.
We got in trouble 'cause you weren't bringing enough money home.
Are you kidding?
I work like a fool on that truck and I come in here and you're always watching Days of Our Lives.
You don't clean up this house or nothing.
This was the real test.
It takes a lot to coordinate this place.
Well, here I am, ready to go to dinner.
What are we gonna eat?
Steak?
Lobster?
Roast beef?
Or should we have a little bit of each.
Son, what's the matter?
It's this check, Pop.
I feel funny about it.
You feel funny?
You ought to feel good.
We got money to pay all the bills.
Yeah, I know, but it's the dishonest way we got it, Pop.
- It's almost like we stole it.
- Stole it?
I worked for that money.
Do you know how much money Richard Burton gets for a acting job like that?
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
We were acting.
What do you mean?
You wanna give the check back?
Well, give me my half and I'll go to the doctor and get a checkup.
There's nothing wrong with you.
If you give that money back, I'm gonna be real sick.
Listen.
This is the idea I had, Pop.
We'll hold on to the check and we'll look at it as kind of a loan, see?
And we'll pay him a little bit every week until we get it all paid up.
It's a shame just to waste a good acting job like that.
I'll tell you what then.
We won't go out to dinner.
We'll just stay home and eat here and you can save that money.
Well, what are we gonna eat?
- Pork and beans and zucchini.
- Are you serious?
Just another one of my great acting jobs.
Come on, son.
Let's go to dinner.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Pop, you should've seen what I was coming across - What's that?
- What's what?
- That thing on your head.
- What's it look like?
On a Frenchman it would look like a beret.
On you it looks like a chocolate upside-down cake.
Help me move this table.
I got some big stuff to bring in.
Move it?
I just put this stuff down here.
I'm doing inventory.
This is coordinatin' day.
When I coordinate, I don't want nobody to fool around.
And if you wanna worry about this hat, don't worry.
I was looking through some old things upstairs and I ran across one of the souvenirs from France, World War I. World War I, huh?
That's right.
World War I, AEF, Fightin' 15th General Blackjack Pershing.
See, he was white, but they called him Blackjack I think because of the kind of gum he chewed.
- Pop, how old are you?
- You know how old I am.
I'm 65.
World War I was in 1917.
You was 11 years old.
What did they give you to fight with, a BB gun?
- Did I say World War I?
- That's right.
Well, I must've meant World War II.
- World War II, France.
- France.
Yeah.
Third Army, General Patton, Old Blood and Guts.
And what did they call you, Tired Blood and No Guts?
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about World War II.
D-Day.
Vive la France.
I got the scar right here to prove it, and the Purple Heart.
Pop, you know you never left Fort Dix, New Jersey and that scar, you got from an appendix operation the army gave you the Purple Heart, you won in a crap game and that beret, you bought at the Goodwill store.
How would you like one across your lip?
- Sure.
That's always your answer.
- Just don't call me no liar.
Don't give me that nonsense about D-Day and vive la France and all of that.
Well, I was in the army.
I could've been in the air force.
They were lookin' for a tail gunner and I turned that down.
- Why?
- I won't sit in the back of no plane.
Would you stop.
- You wasn't in no army.
- You talk that old stuff.
Come on out here and help me unload this truck, you old faker.
- Faker?
- That's right.
You just don't know.
You don't know where I've been.
I don't understand you kids today.
If I'd talk to my father like you talk to me, you know what he'd have done?
Yeah, he'd have given you one across the lip.
That's right, and continue on down from there.
When he whipped, he whipped from the lips to the hips.
And that's the answer?
It might not be the answer, but it sure was no question when he finished.
Pop, the kids today don't wanna hear nonsense.
They want the truth.
The truth shall set you free.
Yeah.
Your Uncle Edgar thought the same thing.
Truth would set him free, and he told the truth and the judge gave him six months.
Oh, my heart!
I think I'm having a heart attack.
You hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm coming to join you, honey.
And your dummy son, he's brought me a wooden overcoat.
- What's the matter with you?
- Them coffins, ain't they?
Of course they're coffins, but they can't hurt you.
- Come over here.
Come over here.
- Don't bother me.
Don't touch me.
- I'm not going near them things.
- Just take it easy.
Now, listen.
Listen.
There's nobody in here.
Listen.
- Anybody in there?
No.
- Don't do that.
Haven't you ever seen coffins before?
Yeah, but not in my own backyard.
Get 'em out of here.
- I paid $25 for these.
- I don't care what you paid for 'em.
- Get 'em out of here.
- Listen to me.
We can make ourselves a nice little profit on these things.
I bought 'em at an auction.
Nobody else would bid on 'em.
Nobody would bid on 'em but an undertaker and a dummy.
And you ain't no undertaker.
Would you stop that and start thinking like a businessman.
I'm telling you, we can make a hundred percent profit on these things.
What's wrong with 'em?
I don't know.
Maybe they last year's model.
Coffins are like bathtubs.
They never go out of style.
I don't like bathtubs.
I take a shower.
- Just get 'em out of here.
- Would you listen to me?
We all have to go sometime.
Somebody's gonna need these coffins, and they'll come and take 'em off our hands.
I hope if they need 'em, they come and take 'em before they need 'em.
That's when we'll make ourselves a nice little profit on the deal, okay?
Okay, but they ain't stayin' out here in the yard.
Of course not.
They're going in the house.
What?
You don't think I'm gonna leave 'em out here.
They'll get ruined out here.
- Well, they ain't going in the house.
- Well, they're not staying out here.
- And they ain't going in the house.
- Yes, they are.
No, they're not.
Over my dead body.
Well, that's one sale we got.
Which one do you want?
I think they're both the same size.
And they're a good color.
- Brown will go with anything.
- So will this brown go with anything.
Would you grab the other end when I slide this out, okay?
I ain't going in first.
Make me feel like a pallbearer.
That's a bad sign, havin' coffins in the house.
You believe all them silly superstitions, don't you?
Don't open an umbrella in the house.
Don't put your shoes on the table.
Don't put your hat on the bed.
Put it right down here.
And what's that other one you told me that time?
Oh, yeah.
A cat yowling at midnight means there's gonna be a death in the house.
Come and help me get the other.
You can think what you want to, but it happened.
Happened to my Cousin Richard.
Cat yowled and yowled and yowled outside the house all night.
They found him the next morning, dead.
Pop, the cat was yowling 'cause he never saw anybody that liquored up.
And as for your Cousin Richard, they found him dead, all right.
He was dead drunk.
Grab that other end.
I sure don't like to touch these things.
- Would you get in there?
- I ain't going in first.
Haven't you ever heard of that old sayin' "The second time through you gotta go feet first"?
- I didn't I didn't remember that.
- Yeah.
Okay, you're right.
Now, You see that?
I just made that up and you believed me.
That's how superstitions get started.
Yeah, but what about when all them pigeons gathered on top of Miss Johnson's house, and I told you that was a bad sign?
I said Miss Johnson's not gonna be around long.
And within a year, she was dead.
Miss Johnson was 97 years old.
Well, the pigeons knew it.
They knew they had to take a rest.
Pigeons can't fly forever.
Why'd they have to rest on top of her roof?
You can't answer that, can you?
I can't answer that 'cause it doesn't make any sense.
That's part of the nonsense that we were just talking about.
Ain't no nonsense.
It's a bad sign.
You get these things out of here.
You turned this house into a place of mourning.
And I suppose up until now this junkyard has been Fun City.
I think these coffins kind of cheer the place up.
Don't sit down on that.
That's a bad sign.
Something awful will happen.
Pop, if that was the case, there wouldn't be an undertaker alive.
They're surrounded by these things all day.
Yeah, but that's different.
That's their job.
And it's not a bad one.
That's not a bad business to get into.
Listen.
You'd make a real fine undertaker.
- You got cold hands.
- Don't touch me.
And a nice sad kisser.
You'd do real good.
I can see it now.
"Sanford and Son, Funeral Directors.
" "Immediate family, right this way to the first row, please.
" You stop talkin' like that.
You watch and see.
- Something awful's gonna happen.
- Don't worry.
Just relax.
We'll have a customer for these things before the day is over.
On the way home I stopped by the barbershop to spread the word.
What are we gonna do in the meantime, stretch out in 'em and watch TV?
- That's not a bad idea.
- Shut up.
Listen.
If we can't sell these we could cut the back out and make a sofa or a couch.
Hush.
If we only sell one of'em, we can cut the other one in half and we can make matching end tables.
That's right.
We ain't never had matching end tables.
- What do you say, Pop?
- Don't call me Pop.
You don't sound like no son of mine.
You sound like the son of Frankenstein.
You really are ridiculous.
You see?
There's a customer already.
Well, there goes our matching end tables.
- Yeah?
- Mr. Sanford?
I'm Nelson Lee Davis of the Davis Funeral Home.
- Oh, yeah.
- You have some caskets for sale?
- Right.
Come on in, Mr. Davis.
- Thank you.
- This is my father.
- How do you do, Mr. Sanford?
You must excuse my cold hands.
Cold hands, warm chapel.
That's a little joke in my profession.
That's as funny as a train wreck.
Now, that'd get you some business.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- Mr. Davis, the coffins are here.
- Ah, yes.
Ain't nobody in there.
Dummy checked.
May I ask if you might know who the last owner happened to be?
It was a little old lady from Pasadena.
A little joke from my profession.
Would you stop that.
Why do you ask, Mr. Davis?
Well, I would like to know a little about the construction.
For example, are they lined with copper or zinc?
- It makes a difference.
- Not to the one who's getting in 'em.
Would you stop it.
Besides, they are rather plain, aren't they?
- What were you thinking of asking?
- Fifty dollars apiece.
- Fifty dollars?
- Well, what were you thinking?
I was thinking $25, for the two.
You know something?
That's good thinking.
- That's good thinking.
Take it.
- I'm sorry.
What about $30?
I'm sorry.
Fifty dollars apiece.
I'm sorry.
Thirty dollars.
That's my final offer.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Davis.
- Well, I am too.
Well, gentlemen, I won't take up any more of your time.
Good day.
If you change your mind, give me a call.
It's been a slow week.
Business is dead.
I heard that one at the morticians' convention.
Good day, gentlemen.
You could've sold 'em.
He offered you $30.
Thirty dollars?
Are you kidding?
That's only five dollars profit.
I'm telling you, Pop, I'm gonna make a killing with these.
Why don't you make two killings and get rid of both of'em?
You see that?
There's another customer already.
Sell these two.
- Hey, Melvin.
- Hello, Lamont.
- How you doing?
- Hello, Fred.
Good-bye, Fred.
Good-bye, Lamont.
Wait a minute.
Melvin!
Melvin!
Come on back.
Come on You big dummy, I'm gonna lose all my good friends.
You get them things out the house.
There's another customer.
What did I tell you?
This time of evening?
Are you kidding?
Just watch and see.
- Hey, Melvin.
Come on in.
- Are those caskets still in here?
If they are, I'm not coming in.
Hey, Fred, come on out here.
It's your friend Melvin.
Come on back in the house and watch some TV.
I'm not coming back in while you got those two things in your living room.
I don't wanna go in there either.
Do you know anybody around that might be able to use one?
If he can use it, he ain't no longer around.
On the other hand, if he's around, he can't use it.
It's a tough item to sell.
Sort of like selling Christmas trees the day after Christmas.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
What'd you let him buy them things for anyway?
I didn't.
You know how kids are today.
They got what they call "doing their thing.
" He won't even listen.
I guess we were the same way when we were young, Fred.
- Yeah.
- Did you listen to your father?
Every time he raised that strap up, he had my complete attention.
Are you two just gonna stay out there and talk?
Yeah, we gonna stay out here and talk.
Two old superstitious men, you and Melvin.
- I ain't superstitious.
- Me either.
But I ain't going back in there.
Look at my right eye jumping.
Yeah.
Well, you better get home.
That means somebody's there waitin' for you.
And hurry 'cause it might rain.
- How can you tell?
- My corn's been actin' up.
- That's a true sign.
- It is.
I'm going home before it starts raining.
I'll see you later on.
- All right.
- Come on by anytime.
You almost caused me to lose my best friend.
And what are you gonna do with these things?
What do you mean, what am I gonna do with them?
The undertaker didn't buy 'em.
Now you ain't gonna ever get rid of'em.
Don't worry.
They'll be gone by tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
You mean they stayin' here tonight?
I already told you, they'll get ruined out in the yard.
- Lf they stayin' here, then I'm leavin'.
- What?
That's right.
I ain't stayin' in no house with no coffins.
You'd rather leave than stay in the house with these things?
I would rather.
- Where are you gonna sleep?
- I'll sleep out on the truck.
- On the truck?
- Uh-huh.
Pop, the truck smells like gasoline.
That don't make me no difference.
I'll get a couple of blankets.
You mean you're actually gonna sleep out there on the truck?
- Yep.
- That makes no sense.
- All that smell of gasoline.
- Gasoline clears my sinuses.
But what about your arthritis?
That's bad for your arthritis.
I've slept under worse conditions in the trenches.
The trenches?
That's right.
They had trenches at Fort Dix.
This is really ridiculous.
You're actually gonna go through with it?
These are just two empty coffins.
They can't hurt you.
But if I stay here tonight, you won't have to sell but one of'em.
When I was a kid, I heard a story once.
A fella stayed in the house all night with a coffin and the next morning, his hair had turned white.
Now, you'd look good with white hair just likeJackie Robinson.
Pop, that doesn't make any sense.
These things can't hurt you.
- What are you afraid of?
- Nothin'.
Ain't nothin' gonna hurt me.
- I'm just gonna get me some sleep.
- I'll leave the door open for you - in case you change your mind.
- You can close it.
I ain't gonna change my mind.
Good night, Jackie.
He's scared of two He doesn't make any sense.
It's ridiculous.
Just two coffins.
I'm not afraid.
I'll stay in here.
Don't bother me.
- Say, Pop, can you hear me?
- What?
I just wanted to know if you was all right and to tell you that I left the door open for you in case you change your mind.
- I know.
- Okay.
I know.
Just close the door.
Leave me alone.
I don't want you to be scared out there.
This is ridiculous.
Two empty coffins.
I'm going to bed.
What are you trying to do, give me a heart attack?
I just wanted to tell you that the lights don't work.
What you come out here and try to kill me for?
Go in there and put a fuse in.
Yeah, that's what I'll do.
I'll change the fuse.
- It probably just needs a fuse.
- Yeah.
Go, will you?
- I'll just go change it.
- Please change it.
The fuse.
- Good night.
- Night.
Pop, where's the fuses?
Where you expect 'em to be, in the fruit bowl?
They in the fuse box.
I'll just go get one in the fuse box and I'll have it changed in a minute.
- You don't have to worry.
- Will you go on in.
I'll just change the fuse.
- What?
Who is it?
- It's me, Pop.
Lamont.
- Hi, Pop.
- Hi, son.
- What time is it?
- It's just a little after 12.
Why you wakin' me up at a little after 12?
- I wanted to see if you was all right.
- I'm all right.
Leave me alone.
Good night.
Night.
- Say, Pop.
- What is it?
- What is it now?
- You better come back in the house.
- Are those things still in there?
- Yeah.
- Then I ain't coming back in.
- But what about your arthritis?
You only got arthritis in your hands.
If you stay out here you'll be a cripple from your neck down.
And we'll be a perfect match 'cause you're a cripple from your neck up.
But what if something happens to you and I'm not out here to help you?
Ain't nothin' gonna happen to me.
Please let me get some sleep.
I was layin' here dreaming about Lena Horne.
Now, please, let me rejoin Lena.
You mean you're really not coming back in?
I mean I'm really not.
If you're gonna be foolish about it, I'm just gonna have to stay here with you.
No, no, now, listen.
There's no need of you being out here afraid alone at night so I'm just gonna stay out here with you.
This is ridiculous.
You're ridiculous.
And I'm ridiculous for being out here with you.
- Then go back in the house.
- Don't be ridiculous.
Pop, you asleep?
No, I'm just checking my eyelids for cracks.
Say, Pop?
What is wrong with you?
If I get rid of them coffins, would you come back in the house?
- Are you gonna get rid of'em tonight?
- No, the first thing tomorrow morning.
Then I'll see you the first thing tomorrow morning.
That's what I'll do.
I'll just get rid of'em the first thing tomorrow 'cause if you're scared, you're scared.
That's nothing to be ashamed about.
Some of us get scared.
If you believe in that kind of stuff, then it can get to you.
Fortunately, I don't believe in that, 'cause those coffins are in here and you and me are out here.
I got 'em loaded on your truck, Mr. Davis.
They're ready to go.
Thank you.
And here is your check for $25.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Sanford.
I can't shake on account of my arthritis.
I understand.
By the way, do you think you'll be getting your hands on any more coffins?
I hate to disappoint you but this is our final going out of business forever coffin sale.
Well, thank you again.
I must be getting back to my place now.
Like everybody else, I'm a working stiff.
Another little joke in the profession.
Well, I hope you're satisfied.
I got exactly what I paid for 'em and it's all because of you and your silly superstitions.
Ain't got nothing to do with superstition.
I just wanted them out.
And I suppose now you're gonna tell me that you're not superstitious.
I'm not.
That's something you made up in your mind.
I'm not supersti - What's the matter with you?
- Undertaker left his hat.
He left it on the table, and it's Friday and the clock is striking 12.
- Where you going?
- I'm getting out of here.
I'm gonna check the roof for pigeons.
Would you come back here.
Listen.
I'll take Listen Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Hello.
Melvin?
Listen.
This is Lamont.
Is my father over at your place?
I don't understand it.
He's always got my supper ready for me at 6:00 and here it is after 8:00, and I don't know where he is.
No, he didn't tell me where he was going.
No, thanks, Melvin.
It's all right.
No Melvin, I don't like pigs' feet.
Okay, good-bye.
Thanks for a very nice evening, Mr. Sanford.
And you're welcome, Mrs. Harris.
Thanks for picking me up and dropping me off.
My pleasure, Mr. Sanford.
I'm sorry I don't have a car.
All I got is this old truck, and the springs are gone so it wouldn't be too good for your back.
And I don't have no seat belt so it wouldn't be too good for your front either.
Don't worry about it, Mr. Sanford.
- Mrs. Harris.
- Yes, Mr. Sanford?
Isn't it about time that we start calling each other by our first name?
All right, Mr. Sanford.
- I did it again.
- Yeah.
- What did you say your first name was?
- Donna.
That's pretty.
Mine's Fred.
Wait a minute.
Sir Walter Raleigh.
Thank you.
"Donna" means "lady," you know.
And "Fred" means "man.
" So, that's gonna work out just right, ain't it?
Yes, it is.
Hey, you know, actually, I knew your name was Donna but I just didn't wanna start calling you that, in case you didn't like it.
- You know what I mean?
- Yes, Fred.
Did you speak to your son yet?
Did you tell him about us?
- No, not yet.
- But don't you think you should?
What if he objects to our getting married?
Oh, he won't object.
It's a nice thing, you and I getting married.
It's like "September Song.
" Oh, it's a long, long while from May to Septem- Decem I done forget.
But anyway, you May and I'm September.
- Yes.
- And if I wait any longer I'll be December.
- Be ready for the deep freeze.
- Don't say that, Fred.
You know what they say You're as young as you feel.
Yeah, well, I'm 65 and people say I look 55.
And I feel 45.
I'd settle for 35.
But you make me feel 25.
You're doing all right.
You're what we ladies call an eligible bachelor.
Yeah.
I got most of my teeth and some of my hair and I got all of my social security.
Well, I better be going.
Thanks again for the movie.
I really enjoyed it.
You didn't mind sitting up in the front row?
Didn't hurt your eyes, did it?
No, it was fine.
See, in this day of the natural hairdo see, you can't see sittin' behind some people.
That's true.
Oh, Donna, here's a half a box of thoseJujyfruits.
- You take 'em with you.
- You keep them.
Too many calories.
I have to watch my figure, you know.
Yeah, you do that.
Ain't no need of both of us watching it.
You say the funniest things.
You really do.
Yeah, I get off a goody every now and then.
- Well - Well, good night.
- Don't forget to speak to your son.
- I won't.
- And you drive carefully.
- I will.
Drive carefully.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Hello, son.
- Where have you been?
- I was out.
- No fooling.
I thought you were sitting on that sofa all this time.
What are you all dressed up for anyway?
I was out.
You had to put on them clothes to go out?
You gonna go out, you supposed to put on some clothes.
You want me to get arrested or something?
All I know is that there was no supper.
I left you something in there on the stove.
All you had to do was heat it up.
I fixed you some meat loaf and okra.
Okra?
You hate okra.
I hate it, but I didn't know you did.
- Yes, it's slimy, ain't it?
- Right.
I ain't gonna fix that no more.
Pop, I work hard all day and when I come home, I expect to have a hot meal waiting for me.
Now, I came home tonight and there was none.
Now, what do we learn from this little lesson?
We learn from this little lesson that both of us hate okra.
Well, I expect to have a hot meal waiting for me.
- And you always have one.
- There was none tonight.
Well, here.
Try someJujyfruits.
I don't want noJujyfruits.
I want something that's gonna stick to my ribs.
Well, they don't stick to your ribs, but they sure stick to your teeth.
May I ask where you've been?
- I went to the movies.
- The movies, huh?
Down at the Paradise.
Two features.
Forty-nine cents.
Two westerns.
It was a Clint Eastwood festival.
Both pictures was good too.
"Fistful of Rain" and "Hat Full of Dollars.
" Are you kidding me?
How long do you think I'm gonna put up with this?
You at the movies with Jujyfruits and me at home with okra.
What are you talking about?
I don't do it that often.
Supper's been late ten times this month.
Where else do you go during the day, to a topless bar?
You shut your mouth.
You know good and well I'm a avid Baptist.
One of these days you're gonna wake up and find that your only means of support has flown the coop.
You not only working for me.
You working for yourself.
Yeah, but I could do a lot better if I was on my own.
- You really think so?
- I know so.
Well, son, maybe I have been holding you back.
Maybe you should go on out and do what you have to do 'cause I don't wanna hold you back, honest.
I know that, Pop.
Listen.
I got teed off'cause there was no supper, so let's forget it.
No, we can't forget it.
See, tonight Well, I mean to say when I went to the movies, I didn't go alone.
- I went with a lady.
- That's great.
Who goes to the movies alone during the day?
Guys that are out of work and winos.
- But you not listening.
- I am listening to you.
You went to the movies with a woman.
You saw a double feature.
You bought someJujyfruits and you forgot about my supper.
I blew up.
I'm sorry.
It's all over now.
Let's forget it.
No, wait a minute.
Let's don't forget it.
What I'm trying to say is this lady that went to the movies with me Yeah?
Well I'm getting married again.
- You kidding me.
- See they took intermission and everybody went outside and got some refreshments.
And I had just enough time to buy these Jujyfruits and ask her to marry me.
I don't believe that.
Well, I've known her a long time.
She's a widow and she's nice and, well, she wanna get married too.
- She does, huh?
- See, we're compatible, her and I. We're really compatible.
See, I'm a Sagittarian, and she's a Leo.
See, Sagittarian is the hunter, and Leo is the lion.
So I got me a lion.
It sounds more like she's Pisces the fish and you got yourself a barracuda.
Listen.
I thought you'd be happy with the news.
I'm not.
It's ridiculous.
You too old to get married.
You 65.
So what?
Cary Grant got married again when he was in his sixties.
Yeah, but you're not Cary Grant.
I'm not General Grant either.
I'm up here with Cary, not down there with Ulysses.
Well, how old is this person anyway?
- She's around 40.
- Yeah.
Way round.
Not that far.
She got her own money.
And she got her own car.
She's a practical nurse.
- She is, huh?
- You know what she did in the movies?
She massaged my neck so good, I heard it crack.
My neck cracked, and it never felt this good before in my life.
Look.
I can do this now.
That's terrific.
Now you can watch the Ping-Pong matches.
It ain't bad being married to a woman who can crack your neck every morning.
You've got it made now.
And she also does toes.
Yeah, see, I took my shoe off and she cracked my big toe.
With all that cracking going on, I'm surprised they didn't throw you two out of the theater.
You couldn't hear the cracking because of too much shooting on the screen.
Clint Eastwood pulled out his pistol and shot 11 bad guys and a water buffalo.
Didn't even reload.
He must've had a 12-shooter.
When are you two lovebirds gonna stagger down the aisle together?
If you mean when are we gonna get married, in a couple of weeks.
- You didn't waste any time, did you?
- I don't have time to waste no time.
Wonder who that is.
Maybe your bride-to-be can't wait and wants to elope.
- Hi, Melvin.
- Hello, Lamont.
Fred, you're home.
Hello, Melvin.
Have some sit-down.
- Oh, yeah.
- What's the matter?
I was worried about you.
Lamont called and said you weren't home and I thought maybe you had an accident.
- Not yet, Melvin.
In a few weeks.
- What?
Tell your friend who's not married and doesn't even think about it what you're about to do.
I'd like to hear what he's got to say.
- Say about what?
- My father's getting married again.
Congratulations.
I think that's great.
Stay out of this, Melvin.
- Are you really gonna do it?
- Yeah.
- Who's the lucky lady?
- Her name is Donna.
Donna Harris.
She's a practical nurse.
They nice.
Yeah, they wear those soft white shoes and have cool hands.
And if I need anything from the surgical supply store she can get it for me at a discount.
How romantic.
I can see the two of y'all shopping for your honeymoon buying rubber stockings and orthopedic shoes.
Hey, but that's great, Fred.
When the time comes and you need a truss she can get you a nice leather one instead of the old elastic kind they give you down at the clinic.
And if you need something, let me know.
You need anything, Melvin?
I don't know.
I'll feel around and see.
Hey, Fred, are you gonna live here?
I think I'm gonna move and sell the place.
But not right away.
I wanna give Lamont enough time to find somewhere to live.
So now I'm getting kicked out, huh?
After I've worked for you all these years, I'm getting thrown out the door.
That ain't right.
Lamont's been a good boy and now you're throwing him out.
Keep out of this, Melvin.
Listen, son.
You wanna live here with us?
With us?
You're bringing that woman in the same house my mother lived in?
Sleep in the same bedroom my mother slept in?
I think that's disgusting.
- That's disgusting, Fred.
- Stay out of this, Melvin.
Son, you know your mama's been dead for over 20 years.
Yeah.
Your mother's been dead for over 20 years.
Stay out of this, Melvin.
All I know is that you forgot about her.
Well, I didn't.
And I'm not gonna let you smear her memory.
Smear her memory?
I never did nothing to smear your mother's memory.
- I been faithful to her.
- All I know is you forgot about her.
- Yeah, you forgot about her, Fred.
- Please stay out of this, Melvin.
And that's another thing.
You got a plot right next to Mom's.
Now you getting married again, how's that gonna work out for later?
I can get a plot for my new wife and then when I go, you can just drop me between 'em.
I think that's disgusting.
I think the whole idea is disgusting.
Yeah, it's disgusting, Fred.
I know.
Stay out of it, Melvin.
I'm going down to the diner, but I want you to know right now that I think the idea of you getting married at your age is ridiculous.
Shut up, Melvin.
Pop, you home?
You better be home.
Hello, son.
I thought I heard you.
- What are you all dressed up for?
- I'm not dressed up.
- Those are your good pants.
- Yeah, but I'm not dressed up.
I was watching the Galloping Gourmet and he said that dinner was the one meal where you should be festive.
So I put on my new pants here so I can be festive.
Come on over and sit down and I'll bring your dinner to you.
And have some See, another thing is wine.
That's another thing makes it festive.
Good French wine.
Hey, Pop, this is Mogen David.
I couldn't get French, so I gotJewish.
Have a taste of wine.
I'll get your dinner.
And it's gonna be festive.
Here you are.
Pork chops and fried apple rings.
- That's your favorite, ain't it?
- It sure is.
Have some more of this good wine here.
I don't even know if you're supposed to haveJewish wine with pork.
You cooked this?
I didn't know you could cook like this.
Me and the Galloping Gourmet.
This is great.
Talk about making up for yesterday.
- Where's yours?
Aren't you gonna eat?
- I'll get mine in a minute.
- How was your day?
- It was pretty good.
- You know what I picked up?
- What?
- A brass cuspidor.
- No kidding.
We can shine it up and sell it as an antique.
Yeah.
You know, in the old days every saloon had a cuspidor.
You know what I mean?
Nothing but a bar and a cuspidor.
Nowadays you go in a place, they got seats, stools, booths.
Lots of places to sit and nowhere to spit.
Good evening.
Donna, this is my son Lamont.
Lamont, Donna Harris.
Please sit down and finish your meal.
Your father has told me so much about you.
You look like your father.
Really?
Everybody says I look like my mother.
That's true.
Without that mustache, he would look like his mother.
Even though she did have some fuzz on her top lip.
- You remember that, don't you, son?
- Aren't you going to finish eating?
- I'm not hungry.
- I made it especially for you.
- Your father said it was your favorite.
- It was when my mother used to make it.
- How did your mother used to make it?
- Used to burn it.
That's a lie and you know it.
She was a terrific cook.
Burned everything.
She burned the bread, the meat, the salad.
House was always full of smoke.
All my friends thought I was getting my clothes from a fire sale.
How dare you talk like that about my mother in front of this woman.
- I was only tellin' the truth.
- You don't talk about my mother Please!
Now, Lamont I take it you don't approve of your father and I getting married.
- Do you mind telling me why?
- 'Cause it's ridiculous, that's why.
He's too old, and you're gonna be miserable.
What kind of life is it, being the wife of an old man?
What kind of life you think it is being the father of a young dummy?
And don't try to tell me nothing about my mother.
Please!
Please, stop it!
Lamont, I think you owe your father an apology.
And I owe him one across his lip.
After all, he is your father, and you ought to show some respect.
- Tell that dummy.
- And, Fred, you be quiet.
- What?
- You only make things worse.
Your son has a right to his opinion, and he has a right to defend his mother.
- So be quiet.
- Don't tell me how to talk to my son.
And don't you raise your voice at me.
- I'll raise my voice when I get ready.
- Not to me you won't.
You and anybody else.
You don't tell me when to raise my voice.
I ain't take no stuff off my first wife and I ain't gonna take none off you.
I'm beginning to understand why she died so young.
Well, your old man Your husband didn't live too long either, did he?
I'm glad I found out about your bad temper.
And I'm glad I found out about your big mouth.
If you will excuse me, I'll just get my coat.
- Wait a minute.
Where you going?
- I'm leaving.
I don't see any reason to stay on.
Do you?
Listen.
I didn't mean to upset you.
You gonna let a little argument ruin all our plans?
You said some very nasty things to me, Fred.
Very nasty.
But we're supposed to be compatible.
It would be different if you was Taurus the bull.
But you not a bull.
You Leo the lion.
- Well, that's true.
- Well, will you stay?
- If you're really and truly sorry.
- I really am truly sorry.
- Honestly?
- Honestly.
- All right.
I'll stay.
- Great.
Come on back over here and sit down.
Hey, son, I took back all the things I said about Donna.
Now everything's all right again.
Oh, really?
Even the part about how she's over the hill?
Who said that?
He did.
Last night, when he was talking about you.
What you wanna bring that up for?
As long as you taking stuff back, you might as well take it all back.
There's no need to starting off your marriage with secrets between you.
Did you say that about me?
I don't remember.
If I said it, I didn't mean it the way it sounded.
Just how did you mean it?
Well I might have said for somebody that was over the hill, you wasn't bad.
And if you put on some dark glasses people wouldn't be able to see them bags under your eyes.
Well, I think that just about does it.
- Well, what's the matter?
- You are very much out of line Mr. Sanford.
If you think you're gonna shut me up when I get ready to say something then you can forget about the whole thing - Mrs. Harris.
- That's fine with me.
- I'm leaving.
- Bye.
I should have realized you have the manners of a common junkman.
And I should've realized that you aren't over the hill.
You down in the valley.
You not Leo the lion!
You Donna the barracuda!
I should've known she was gonna turn out like that.
It's a good thing you found out in time.
Yeah.
I ain't gonna let no woman walk over me.
- You really stood up to her.
- You have to.
I was proud of you.
You got to get things straightened out right in the beginning.
- Right.
- Right.
You know, son I don't remember saying she was over the hill.
- You don't, huh?
- No.
- I was sure you did.
- Hey, Pop.
Did what's-her-name make any dessert?
She made some hot sweet potato pie like your mama used to make.
I hope it's better than Mama used to make.
I'll get it.
Hey, son.
I really don't remember saying she was over the hill.
- Yeah, well - But you know what?
- What?
- She is.
I'll bet she's older than I am.
I'll bet that's her coming to apologize.
Tell her it's too late, Pop.
I'll tell her.
I don't accept no apologies.
I'll tell her.
You don't need to apologize Hello, Fred.
I got a gift for you.
Congratulations, man.
I wish you a lot of luck and everything.
I know.
Stay out of it, Melvin.
- But I got to run.
Many happy returns.
- But wait a minute.
- What is it, Pop?
- Melvin just gave me a wedding present.
- Let's see what it is.
- I didn't even have a chance to tell him it was all over.
- Read the card there.
- What is it?
It's a popcorn popper.
It says: "To the Sanfords, to the happy couple may you have a long life popping along together.
- That's sweet of him.
- Your friend Melvin.
" We're gonna have to give it back to him.
Why?
Give me the card again.
It says: "To the Sanfords.
" - We the Sanfords, ain't we?
- Right.
"To the happy couple.
" We happy, ain't we?
- Right.
- And a long life together.
- We deserve that.
- Right.
- Well?
- Let's pop some popcorn, Pop.
Let's get to poppin'.
Say, Pop, I'm home.
Pop.
Hello, son.
I thought I heard you come in.
- Don't tell me you're gonna do it again.
- What?
When the table is set up and there's a good smell and noise from the kitchen then that means there's a woman here.
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, lady, you can come on out now!
- Hello, Lamont.
- It's only Melvin.
- He brought us some pig feet.
- I'm sorry, Pop.
You should be sorry 'cause I ain't gonna never get married again.
I learned my lesson.
I ain't marrying nobody.
I don't care who it is.
- You don't care who it is, huh?
- That's right.
I'll bet you if you had the chance to, you'd marry Lena Horne.
I wouldn't even marry Lena Horne.
Say, Melvin, if you had the chance, wouldn't you marry Lena Horne?
You just stay out of this, Fred.
I'll marry Lena Horne.

Hey, Fred.
Is that as loud as that TV'll go?
I can't hear nothin'.
You wanna make it louder?
Do like this.
- Can't you turn the sound up?
- It's up as high as it'll go now.
And look at that picture.
There's two Humphrey Bogarts.
Can't you fix it?
There's some knobs on here where you can fix the picture and the sound.
Tell me what to do.
I'll fix it.
See them knobs back there and one of'em say "volume control"?
- Yeah.
- And there's two more "horizontal hold" and "vertical hold.
" And down below, two knobs say "brightness" and one says "fine tuning.
" - Yeah.
- Forget about all of them and just hit it on the side with your fist.
Go ahead and hit it once.
Once, Melvin.
You can't fix nothin'.
Now look at it.
There's four Humphrey Bogarts and six Lauren Bacalls.
This is supposed to be a love scene.
Look like they playing basketball.
See, now, watch me.
All you got to do is just tap it.
Well, I guess this set's had it.
Hey, listen, Fred.
Why don't you ask your son to buy you a new TV?
He said we couldn't afford it.
Said other things came first.
Like what?
Like if he was in an accident with the truck, he would need all the money while he spent that time in the hospital.
Yeah, while he's in the hospital, you here all alone without a TV.
- Yeah.
- Ask him to buy you a set.
- Yeah.
- In color, with a big screen.
And that remote control.
All you got to do is move your thumb.
Never get up out your chair.
Just use your thumb.
Yeah.
And after sitting around all evening drinking beer that'll be about all you can lift is your thumb.
I better clean up this place before Lamont gets home.
He'll never find 'em.
Hey, Fred, you remember Arthur Matthews?
- The fella with the ugly wife.
- Right.
She put the "U" in "ugly.
" I don't like to talk about nobody but she looked like the part of the Polaroid that you tear off.
But here's the thing.
Arthur's ugly too.
- That's true.
- But his son gave them a big color TV.
Now they don't have to look at each other anymore.
I'm gonna do that.
I'm gonna tell Lamont I want me a new TV.
Right.
Enjoy life.
After all, how long you gonna be here?
Well, my lease ain't up till August.
I mean, enjoy life.
Enjoy some of the things that's gonna be around.
You're right, Melvin.
I'm gonna come right on out and say, "I want a new TV".
Hey, Melvin.
Hey, Pop.
I got a surprise for you.
- I want a new TV.
- What?
I want a new TV, and I'm not taking no for an answer.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about a new TV.
With the big screen.
And remote control.
And color.
I already told you, we can't afford a new television.
And I'm not spending my hard-earned money so you can sit around all day with your buddy, watching TV and drinking beer.
- Well, I guess I better be going.
- Stay, Melvin.
You can't be throwin' my friends out the house.
What are you talking about?
Throwing him out.
Melvin was leaving.
Let him leave.
- Good-bye, Melvin.
- Stay, Melvin.
This is my house.
- I got something to say too.
- Say good-bye.
Your friend is leaving.
Don't move, Melvin.
Come on back in here.
- Melvin, if you wanna go, go.
- Stay, Melvin.
- Go, Melvin.
- No, Melvin.
You guys figure it out, and I'll see you later.
That's a terrible way to treat somebody who come to spend the evening with you.
Yeah, and keep you away from doing your work.
I did my work.
What do you want me to do?
What do I want you to do?
Why don't you clean up outside?
You know what that junkyard looks like?
Ajunkyard.
Just look at this house.
It's a good thing there's a wall over there or I wouldn't know where the yard ends and the house begins.
That's what it takes to make a home.
You ever hear that saying?
"It takes a heap of living to make a home.
" Well, you look in the middle of this heap, there's not one decent television.
I already told you, I am not buying no new television.
Why not?
We can afford it.
We got money saved.
Because I'm gonna buy something that's more important.
- Like what?
- Stick around and you'll find out.
Hello.
Gail?
How you doing?
This is Lamont.
Guess what.
I bought a car.
- A what?
- A car.
A little convertible.
- I knew you'd be surprised.
- This is a bad one.
This is the worst one I ever had.
Would you wait until I get off the phone before you have a heart attack?
He bought a car.
He bought a new car.
Listen.
It's not new.
It's used.
But it's just as good as new.
A car.
What do we need with a car?
So me and you can get around, sugar.
Listen.
You know, I was just thinking.
Saturday morning, maybe we could get together and pack a little picnic basket and ride up the coastline a ways, with the wind in our hair.
You would?
Terrific.
I'll pick you up Saturday morning.
Ciao, baby.
I can't believe you.
I can't believe you'd buy a new car and I need a new TV.
- You always think about yourself.
- What are you talking about, Pop?
- You'll be able to ride in it.
- Let the wind blow through my scalp.
I don't know what to tell you 'cause I've already paid for it.
And not only that, I'm picking it up tomorrow.
You selfish.
That's what you are.
What about me?
Pop, let's face it.
I'm getting a car because I need a car.
I can't continue to take out girls in that old broken-down truck.
What's wrong with the truck?
If she wants her hair to blow in the wind let her take her wig off and hold it out the window.
There's no use.
You don't understand nothing.
Do you realize that everybody has a car today?
And everybody has a color TV.
Arthur Matthews's son bought him a color TV.
That's a good son.
Good and kind and thoughtful.
Pop, Arthur Matthews's son is a crook.
You told me that yourself.
He's a gambler and a hustler and a thief.
If a bum like that can buy his ugly father a TV why can't you get your handsome dad one?
So now I'm not even as good as Arthur Matthews's son, huh?
I don't know how you could go on living with somebody like me.
Well, I ain't, I can't, I'm not, and I'm leaving.
Why don't you go over to Arthur Matthews's house?
You can watch television with him and his ugly wife.
Be like a rose between two thorns.
I'd rather be over there sitting between two ugly people watching television - than to be here with you.
I'm leaving.
- Well, go on, Rosie.
I'm leaving.
And you know that trip you mentioned about going up the coastline?
When you start out there, I hope you run out of gas on a mountain.
And the filling station is ten miles away uphill.
And when you get there, I hope it's closed.
Thanks a lot.
There's nothing wrong with this TV.
I used to watch a whole lot of good shows on this set.
Just turn it on.
Hey, Pop, I got it!
Hey, Pop!
Hey, Pop, I want you to see the car.
It's a blue convertible.
It's a stick.
It's got Pop, come out here and see the car.
Hey, Pop.
Hey, Smitty, Officer Swanhauser.
What's up?
- We have some unpleasant news.
- What?
The important thing is to remain calm and not get too alarmed and panicked.
That won't help anything.
In situations like this, you have to maintain control.
- So take it easy.
- What are you talking about?
Take it easy!
- Okay, what happened?
- Your dad is in the hospital.
- What?
- I'll handle this.
Your dad is in the hospital.
What are you talking about?
What happened?
Your old man got picked up wandering around zonked.
- Zonked?
- I'll read from the official report.
"Unidentified male, black, approximately 60 to 65 later identified as Fred Sanford.
Preliminary medical reports indicating exhaustion and overexposure after subject was discovered wandering aimlessly in downtown area.
- Where's he at now?
- He's in the County General Hosp The subject, Fred Sanford, was admitted to County General Hospital where his condition was termed satisfactory.
" - Then he's all right.
- Yeah.
He's cool.
The report makes no reference to body temperature.
I thought he was going to spend the night at a friend's house.
I never realized he'd end up in a hospital.
I gotta get to him.
Hey, Smitty, what's the fastest way to get to the hospital?
Get right on the Harbor Freeway to the San Bernardino and get off at Mission.
- Harbor, San Bernardino, Mission.
- Hold it.
You're going to County General Hospital.
Fastest way is to get right on the Harbor Freeway to the San Bernardino off at Mission.
And remember, easy now!
Stay cold!
- Cool.
- Cool!
In here, please.
- Doctor?
- Yes?
Mr. Sanford's son is here.
- Thank you, nurse.
- How's he doing, Doctor?
- Well, he's coming along.
- What's the matter with him?
Your father is suffering from loss of memory.
Amnesia.
Amnesia?
He's never had anything like that before.
How did he get it?
We really don't know.
Amnesia's one of those mysterious things that can develop very quickly.
Doctor, I don't know how to say this but my father's been known to play some pretty strange tricks on me.
Is it possible he could be faking this whole thing?
Absolutely not.
How would you explain a man walking the streets like that all night?
As far as I'm concerned, this is your classic amnesia.
That you, Arthur?
Turn on your set and let's watch some color TV.
That's what he does every once in a while.
Calls out for someone named Arthur.
That mean anything?
Yeah, I'm afraid it does.
Is that you, Melvin?
Come on in.
Let's watch some color TV.
- Are you his sole support?
- Yes.
I wish I had a color TV.
Maybe I'll get one where I'm going.
You hear that, Elizabeth?
- Do they have color TV up there?
- Who's Elizabeth?
My mother.
She's dead.
He talks to her whenever he gets upset.
Well, there's your story.
An old man alone at home.
The son has taken over as head of the family, replaced him.
Feels unloved, unwanted.
His life at home has become intolerable.
So his unconscious mind finds release by blocking out all memory of it.
You'll find that a correct analysis.
- Are you the psychiatrist?
- No.
I'm the ear, nose and throat man.
But I know as much as they do.
- He's gonna be all right, isn't he?
- That's up to you.
His recovery and well-being is entirely up to you.
You're all he's got.
Yeah.
Can I see him now, Doctor?
Sure.
That'll be fine.
But try not to upset him.
Mr. Sanford, we have a visitor out here for you.
Just a minute.
Okay, I'm ready now.
Send him in.
- Remember what I said.
- I know.
Try not to upset him.
- Right.
- Okay.
Hey, Pop.
Pop.
- Hi.
- Who are you?
It's me, Pop.
Lamont.
- Lamont who?
- Lamont Sanford.
Never heard of him.
Listen, Pop.
Now, you're Fred Sanford.
Who's he?
That's you, Pop.
Never heard of him.
Listen.
Now, you're Fred Sanford, and I'm Lamont Sanford.
And we live together at 9114 South Central Avenue.
- Where's that?
- That's in Los Angeles, Pop.
Los Angeles.
Where's that?
That's in California, Pop.
Never heard of it.
Why don't you leave me alone anyway.
You beginning to bother me.
Hey, Nurse!
Nurse, come and get him out of here!
Wait a minute, Pop.
Listen to me now.
Try and remember.
You see, me and you, we have a business together.
We got a junkyard and we got a house next to that.
- And we got a red pickup truck.
- Yeah?
And outside there's this big sign.
- What does the sign say?
- The sign says, "Sanford and Son.
" Never heard of'em.
Get on out of here and stop bothering me.
Nurse!
Nurse!
Nurse!
Pop, don't you remember anything?
Don't you remember the little room where we have our breakfast and our supper and where we talk?
Our little room.
You remember?
- A room.
- Yeah?
- A table.
- That's right.
A table.
What else?
- And two chairs.
- Two chairs.
Go on, Pop.
- And over in the corner - Yeah?
What's in the corner, Pop?
A new color TV.
- No color TV?
- No color TV.
Listen to me.
As soon as you're well enough, I'm gonna take you out of here.
I'm gonna take you home.
I don't wanna leave this place.
I like it here.
I'm gonna take real good care of you at home.
I'm gonna take you out of here.
That's nice, son.
Son.
You called me son.
Then you remember who I am.
You're from the Red Cross.
You're the one with the candy bars.
You got a Baby Ruth on you?
You ain't got no Baby Ruth on you?
Listen, Pop.
Try to get some sleep, and I'll come back in here and I'll see you later.
But before I go, I want you to take one more look at me.
- Now do you know who I am?
- I think so.
That's great.
I'm not gonna say no more.
Just get some rest and I'll come back and see you some other time.
- Bye, Pop.
- Bye, Melvin.
Well, did he remember you?
Doctor, how long is he gonna be like that?
It's impossible to say.
We had an amnesia patient here once.
Was here for weeks.
Couldn't remember his name, his address, nothing.
- Then all of a sudden, one day - He remembered?
No, he died.
- But my pop's gonna be all right?
- Yes.
He's a very healthy man.
He sleeps well, eats well.
Last night he chased a nurse out onto the fire escape.
What kind of doctor did you say you were?
Ear, nose and throat.
How do you treat a patient that has amnesia?
There's no specific cure.
Best thing you can do is take him home.
Take him home?
And you think that's the best place for him?
Absolutely.
He should have familiar surroundings.
He should have loving care and attention.
He needs a feeling that life isn't over for him that this old world is still a pretty wonderful place to live in.
Besides, we need that bed.
- I'll come and get him in the morning.
- That's the best thing.
He needs the sound of friendly voices around him.
I'll bet you he's listening to us out here.
- It's put him in a nice, relaxed mood.
- Do you think so?
- Absolutely.
- Hold it down so I can get some sleep.
You go back to bed.
You come tomorrow morning.
I'm sure that once he gets home, he'll feel much better.
Thanks.
Mr. Sanford, you're not going home until tomorrow.
I don't wanna go home.
I wanna get out to the fire escape.
Well, here we are, Pop.
Home at last.
I don't live here.
This is a dump.
Listen.
Just wait till you get inside.
You'll remember once you get inside.
I don't like this place.
I wanna go back to the hospital.
At least they had some pretty nurses come around at night and sponge you off.
I know, Pop.
But just come inside.
You got a nurse in there with a sponge?
Then I'm going back to the hospital.
Just give it a chance, Pop.
Just come inside, okay?
All right?
- I don't like this place.
- Come over here and sit in your chair.
This is your chair, Pop.
I don't like this place.
And I don't like you either.
Okay, now, you just sit here, Pop.
Now, I got a surprise for you.
All right?
You ready?
Surprise!
- It's a television.
- Not only that.
It's a color TV.
With remote control.
And it's all yours.
That's wonderful.
That's really wonderful.
- That's a 21-inch screen, isn't it?
- That's right.
They got 24-inch screens now.
Why didn't you get a 24-inch screen?
You see, Pop, a 24-inch screen costs more, and we couldn't afford it.
We could afford it if you hadn't bought that car.
I guess you right.
I took a beating when I sold What a minute.
How did you If you lost your memory, how did you remember that I bought a car?
- You didn't even know who I was.
- The TV is bringing it all back to me.
My son.
You did it to me again, didn't you?
What a dirty underhanded trick.
- You never lost your memory at all.
- Yeah, I'm losing it now.
Where am I?
Who are you?
Come off of that, you old faker.
You know who you are and where you are.
I don't know where I am, but I know who I am.
I'm Arthur Matthews, and I got a color TV.
Sit down, Melvin, and watch it with me.
Look at that.
Is that a great set?
That's really beautiful, Fred.
Never thought I'd see the day when I'd watch Sesame Street in living color.
That's great.
You got a good son.
- Lamont?
- Yeah.
He's the best.
Ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for my son.
Hey, Pop, I'm going to work now.
I don't want you sitting up here all day looking at that television.
That's how we work.
He does something for me.
I do something for him.
I want you to try to get that yard cleaned up out there today.
He gave me this color TV.
I'll do anything he says.
- He's a good son all right.
- Pop, the yard.
All he gotta do is say it, and I'll do it.
Pop, I want Never mind.
I'll do it myself.
Good morning, son.
- What are you doing, Melvin?
- I'm gonna turn the sound up.
Sit down.
Here.
Well, I'll be doggone.
You got a remote control.
You don't even have to get up out your chair.
All you do is use your thumb.
Now, watch my thumb.
What's wrong?
Must be this volume control.
Wait a minute, Fred.
Can't you make it louder?
Yeah.
Hold this.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Pop, I'm home!
Hey, Pop!
Hey, Pop.
- Hello, son.
- You wanna help me unload this truck?
I was reading the paper.
That "Dear Abby.
" You ever read that?
- No.
You wanna help me unload this?
- Wait.
Let me read you one of'em.
"Dear Abby, my husband refuses to bathe.
I have used all kinds of hints, but nothing helps.
I leave soap lying around.
And once I even filled the tub and tried to push him in accidentally.
But nothing seems to work.
He still won't take a bath.
What do you advise?
Signed, Gas Mask.
" - You wanna help me unload this truck?
- Wait.
Let me read you one more.
Listen to this.
"Dear Abby, my husband and I have not spoken to each other for five years.
I hate to be the first one to talk but it looks like I might have to because I'm going to have a baby.
Should I tell him or should I wait till he notices something?
Signed, Stubborn.
" Put that paper down and help me unload this truck.
Problems.
People got problems.
- And I see I got me one.
- What?
Look.
Junk, junk, junk.
That's our business, isn't it?
But this kind of junk make real junk look bad.
What are you talking about?
- Look at them old big tires.
- These are snow tires.
Snow tires?
In Southern California?
That just shows you what you know.
People use these all the time to get up the mountains to those ski resorts.
Oh, yes.
Our neighbors are there all the time skiing and yodeling.
- Look at this trash.
- Trash?
This is good.
This is aluminum.
"Alulimum"?
That's nothin' but old pot metal.
Ain't worth nothin'.
How long you been with me now, Lamont?
What do you mean, how long have I been with you?
Since I was born.
Has it been that long?
Come on, Pop.
All this time in the business and you still haven't developed an eye for junk.
I pick up what I can.
- Look at this.
What is this?
- What's it look like?
You must have found it in an alley.
No, I bought it at Saks Fifth Avenue.
Don't you know people put garbage in stuff like this?
Fill it up with garbage and then throw it out in the alley.
That's another thing you haven't developed is a nose for junk.
I'm not gonna go around smelling the stuff.
When you find something like this, what you should do is step on it.
And if it squishes, then you don't want it.
- All right, I'll just throw it away.
- Wait a minute.
Don't throw it away.
I just wanna give you a lesson in this business.
- A lesson in this business.
- Yeah.
Look at this here.
Garbage.
It's money, Pop.
It's filled with money.
My heart.
My heart.
I ain't never seen that much money in my life.
Hey, Lamont, come here.
Come here and open it up and see if the money's still in there.
Look at that, Pop.
Stacks of twenties, fifties, hundreds.
I can't believe it.
I can't stand it.
I ain't gonna make it.
You hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm coming to join you, honey rich.
Would you Would you stop that, Pop.
This is no time to have a heart attack.
We're rich.
We can retire.
Yeah.
No more getting up at 6:00 to get that old stupid truck started by 8:00.
Forty-five years of hard work keeping my nose to the grindstone wheelin' and dealin' and coordinatin'.
And finally it all paid off.
You found a satchel full of money.
Hey, Pop, let's move.
- And get a new home?
- Why not?
We can afford it now.
- Where would we move to?
- We could move to Beverly Hills.
Beverly Hills.
You think the neighbors will let us live there?
Well, Wilt Chamberlain lives in Beverly Hills.
We better get a house next to Wilt 'cause he'll let us.
And we could travel, Pop.
All around the world.
- Anyplace we wanna go now.
- Yeah, I could go to St. Louis.
I mean we could take a cruise.
We could take a cruise to one of those tropical islands.
- That'd be good for my arthritis.
- Yeah.
It's the police.
They followed me here.
They're gonna think we stole this money.
Don't put it there.
That's too close to the door.
Wait a minute.
Lamont, wait a minute.
Settle down.
That's not the police.
They're not coming.
That's a fire truck.
What are we doing, Pop?
This isn't even our money.
- We got to turn this in.
- Turn it in?
Listen.
You found it.
In the Bible it says, "Finders keepers, losers weepers.
" Where does it say that?
Right next to that part where it says, "Seek and ye shall find.
" This is what I figured happened, Pop.
This money came from a bank robbery 'cause there's too much of it to come from anyplace else.
Now, I figure crook A robbed this money from the bank and he left it in the alley for crook B. But I got there before crook B. And now A and B are looking for me.
I don't care if C, D and E are lookin' for Y-O-U.
I'm not gonna give up this M-O-N-E-Y.
Listen, Pop.
Let's turn the money in.
We'll get a reward.
- Turn it in?
Are you crazy?
- I read it in the papers 100 times.
"Honest citizen returns money to bank.
" Then it always goes on to say how they gave him a reward and a nice steady job.
Yeah.
Twenty-five dollars, a white uniform and a broom.
Pop, we gotta turn it in.
If the bank doesn't track this money down, those crooks will.
That's just you imagining something.
Why you always imagine all that stuff?
Pop, I bet you those crooks followed me home.
Who?
They didn't follow you home when you came in.
I didn't see nobody.
Uh-huh.
There's a strange car parked on the other side of the street.
And it wasn't there when I came in.
Come over here, Pop.
- Come on.
It's right over here.
- Where?
- You see on the other side?
- What's strange about it?
It's been parked in this neighborhood for over five minutes and it's still got tires.
Listen.
Why you keep going around imagining a bunch of stuff?
You found a satchel full of money.
Go enjoy it and spend it.
No, Pop, it makes me too nervous.
Give it to me.
I ain't nervous.
I'm nervous when I ain't got it.
And when I got it, it calms me down.
Then you'll be in trouble.
It's only a matter of time before Uh-huh.
You see that?
Now, those are the crooks.
- They came to get the money.
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Settle down, will ya?
Calm yourself.
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm giving it to 'em.
- I don't want no trouble.
- Wait a minute, son.
We don't want it.
Take it.
L Excuse me, lady.
I thought you was somebody else.
I'm sorry.
Just a minute.
Could you show me some fireplace equipment?
I'm awfully sorry.
We're closed today.
But I saw something very nice in your yard.
Couldn't you just show it to me?
- We're closed, lady.
- We're closed because it's a holiday.
It's a holiday.
What holiday?
I don't know anything about it.
You wouldn't know nothin' about this holiday.
- It's Booker T. Washington's.
- George Washington Carver's.
- It's George Washington Carver's.
- Booker T. Washington.
It's a holiday.
- She's going away.
- That's good.
Say, Pop.
Listen.
We got to give this money to the police 'cause it's just too nerve-racking having it around here.
Listen, son.
You got to think.
Ain't no law that says when you found something that you got to return it or give it back.
- I bet you there is.
- Bet.
That's a bet.
- I bet you $5.00.
- Bet.
- How we gonna find out?
- I'll call the police.
I should've done this from the start.
Hello.
Operator?
Let me have the police.
They'll settle this thing.
Hello, Police.
My name is Jay Rupperow.
I was wondering if you could settle a little argument.
Another gentleman and myself were sitting in the steam room in our club and the subject of finding money came up.
If someone was to find money in the street would he be able to keep it or would he have to turn it in?
I see.
Uh-huh.
Would you mind repeating that for the other gentleman?
Here he is now.
Hello.
This is the other gentleman in the steam room at the club.
What were you telling him about finding money in the street?
Uh-huh.
Well, listen.
What if they found it in a alley?
Thank you ver Thank you very much.
- You heard him.
Give me $5.00.
- What?
You heard him.
If you find some money in the street, you have to turn it in.
If nobody claims it after six months, you get to keep it.
You lost the bet, so give me five bucks.
- You got any change?
- Put that back in.
I'm gonna take this money down to the police.
Wait a minute, Lamont.
Ain't you afraid to go out there with all that money?
What if them crooks are out there like you said?
Yeah.
That's the only thing.
What you should do is call the police and have them come and pick it up.
- That sounds like a good idea.
- In the meantime, we'll keep this safe.
We'll put it in the safe.
See?
- I'll just put this in here.
- Wait a minute.
What's that in there?
There's nothin' in there.
Just some old insurance policies and some stuff like that and your baby shoes.
So that's where the peanut brittle went.
I did it for your own good.
I didn't want your face to break out.
- Thanks a lot.
- Don't blame me 'cause you got your mother's sensitive skin.
I just shut this up in here.
Then it's safe.
- Good.
You got the combination?
- Uh-huh.
- Where is it?
- In the safe.
What?
Oh, Pop.
Well, I guess the money's gonna have to stay here for a while.
That was smart.
The money's in the safe and you don't know the combination.
I know it.
It's locked in there on a piece of paper, but I know it.
What is it?
There's just one thing that I'm not too sure about.
What?
It's something to the left and something to the right.
Then something to the left again.
What are the numbers?
That's the part I'm not too sure about.
Then you don't know it.
I'm gonna call the police.
If you can't figure out the combination to that safe, they can get in there.
Hello.
Operator?
Let me have the police, please?
Listen.
Just don't call the police.
Call our friends, Swanee and Smitty.
Police are police.
What difference does it make?
You bring a strange white policeman in this neighborhood and show him a satchel with $50,000 in it he'll show you the difference.
- You're just try Hello.
Police?
- Ask for Smitty.
I wonder if I can speak to Officer Smith or Swanhauser.
Well, when they do, would you ask them to call Sanford and Son?
Yeah, they know us.
And tell 'em it's important.
Thank you.
They're not on duty yet.
In the meantime, would you please try and come up with that combination?
I'll get my glasses so I can see the numbers on the dial.
Just settle on one pair of glasses and be done with it.
- You always go through this.
- I need all these glasses.
Some of'em are for TV.
Some of'em for reading.
And some of'em for sewing.
- These are them.
- What are those for?
These are the glasses to help me find the glasses that I need to find.
Here they are.
Come on over here.
I'll show you how to do it.
See, I had a way of remembering.
A system, like.
- When was the stock market crash?
'29.
- That's right.
- And World War II ended in '45, right?
- That's right.
And what year was the riots in Watts?
'65.
Correct?
Correct.
That ain't it.
You don't know it.
You don't know nothing.
I know history.
Would you please try and come up with the combination?
Wait.
I remember.
I saw George Raft do this in a movie once.
He had been shot and he was the only one that knew the combination to a safe where some very important government papers were.
So he leaned over by the safe and put his ear near it so he could hear the tumblers.
There's the police now, and you still don't know the number.
I should have never let you lock that money in there in the first place.
Who is it, Lamont?
Is it Smitty or Swanee?
Lamont, who is it?
Is it Great day in the mornin'!
Shut up.
Get your hands in the air.
The other one.
Both of them!
It's the phone.
- Were you expecting a call?
- I wasn't expecting a call.
Were you?
I wasn't expecting a call.
Were you?
- We weren't expecting no call.
- Shut up!
Just keep your mouth closed and answer that phone.
- Me?
- No, the old buzzard.
Come on.
And make it fast.
Hello.
Sanford and Son.
Oh, Swanee.
- Who's Swanee?
- He's a friend of ours.
He was named after the river.
Hello.
What?
I sound like I'm out of breath?
No, we're just doing inventory.
And I'm coordinatin'.
And when I coordinate, I get breathless.
I know I called you.
And when I called you, I needed you.
But I don't need you no more.
If I need you, I'll call you.
Yeah, I gotta go now.
I gotta go now.
I have a customer here and I'm looking at some iron.
Bye.
You picked up a suitcase in an alley, right?
- Did you see me, and did you follow me?
- Why?
Did you see me follow you?
No, I didn't see you follow me.
Did you see him follow me?
I didn't see him follow you.
Did you see him see you followin' him?
- We didn't see anybody follow anybody.
- Just shut up.
Both of you.
Now, I know this suitcase is in this house.
Let me have it.
It's here, but my father locked it in the safe and he forgot the combination.
He did, huh?
It's funny how you can know something all your life and then forget it.
It's just pop right out of your mind.
You know?
Isn't that true, son?
You just forget it.
And you know you know it.
You heard him.
Open it.
And get it out fast.
Come on.
Let me have it.
All right, come on.
Get down here.
Now, I hope you guys didn't take any of this.
Just out of curiosity, how much money's in there?
Shut up.
- Give me some rope.
- Rope?
- Rope.
For tying people up.
- We don't have no rope.
- You thinking of junk - Over in the bureau in the right-hand side of the drawer.
Get it.
You, sit down.
You tie him up.
Tie him up!
Here.
Come on.
Do you know how to tie?
- Yeah, I know how to tie.
- Well, tie.
- I'm tyin'.
- Now, here.
Here.
Tie it around his mouth.
You not gonna shoot me?
You wouldn't shoot an old man with arthritis.
Sit down here.
Get back.
Get back out of sight.
Come on!
Come here.
You answer it.
Get rid of'em fast.
Tell 'em you're closed.
You got that?
We're following through on your request for possible assistance.
- How can we be of service?
- Yeah, what's happening?
Everything's fine.
What's the matter, Fred?
You got something in your eye?
Yeah, it's the smog.
The smog is real bad today.
Indeed it is.
If all citizens would only pull together in the fight against pollution you wouldn't have to suffer, and we'd have clean air for our children.
If everything's okay, we're gonna split.
Yes, that's progress for you.
They can send a man to the moon but they can't do anything about your burning eyes.
- Swanee, let's go.
- This is a serious human problem.
- We're an endangered species.
- We'll see you, Fred.
Come on.
Get over here.
Get over here, you!
Get over to the table.
All right, sit down.
Don't go near the door.
Stay away from the phone.
Don't look out the window.
And no yelling.
You got that?
I didn't hear what you said after you said "sit down.
" But don't go near the door.
Don't answer the phone.
Don't look out the window.
And no yelling.
- Right on.
- That's ours.
Shut up!
I tried.
I tried, Lamont.
I tried to signal Smitty and Swanee.
But, you know, he had a gun in my back.
What could I do?
That's easy for you to say.
Smitty, Swanee, you caught him.
Your erratic behavior at the door aroused our suspicion so we staked out for further surveillance.
You were acting kind of weird, so we hung around.
You rotten old fink.
You cost me 70 thou.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
How would you like one across your lip?
Hold me, Brother Smith.
I'm sure glad they held on to him 'cause I'd have had to hurt him.
See that, son?
Swanee and Smitty got my message after all.
You see, people can talk with their eyes.
Did you know that?
Seem like Seem like you trying to say something to me now.
Would you say that again?
Can you furnish the precise time the suspect executed his forced entry into the above-described premises?
What time did the cat bust into your pad?
It was about 3:30.
That's right.
It was 3:30 'cause the old clock there said 3:30.
It says 3:30 now.
It always says 3:30.
But it still ain't a bad buy for nine dollars.
Eight dollars?
- What was the time?
- It was 3:30.
I checked my watch.
Where was the money at that time?
Money was in the safe.
Right over there.
I told him put it in the safe.
It'll be safe until y'all came to pick it up.
- That safe over there?
- Yeah, that's the one.
I had the satchel.
Come over here.
I'll show you what I did.
See?
I put the satchel right here in the Wells Fargo and then shut the door like this.
And then it was safe.
The safest safe in town.
- Okay, you can take it out now.
- Huh?
Open the safe.
- The combination is inside the safe.
- What?
But don't get excited.
I can open it.
See, I saw George Raft in a picture once.
And he put his ear to the safe like this so he could hear the sound of the tumblers.
I just remembered.
He died before he could get it open.
So I guess the money's gonna have to stay here for a little while.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
That's it.
Left hook.
You got him now.
Did you see that punch?
He ain't gonna never grow hair on that spot no more.
Look at all the women in there screaming, Melvin.
It's surprising how many women like fights.
But they go for different reasons.
A man like to believe that's him in the ring winning and a woman like to believe that's her husband there losing.
Turn the sound down during the commercial.
- That's a good fight, isn't it?
- Yeah.
You want another can of beer before the next round starts?
Yeah, that would be nice.
Lamont, where's your father?
I don't know, Melvin.
Instead of being here with us, enjoying a great fight and having a good time he's probably sitting in some movie, alone and bored.
That's a nice smell.
It is nice, isn't it?
I love the smell of the ocean.
Is that what you smellin'?
I thought it was me.
I got on my Mennen Skin Bracer.
I meant it's nice being so close to the water.
- But you smell good too, Fred.
- Yeah.
Last time I was in Lover's Lane was in St. Louis years ago.
- Just the three of us.
- The three of you?
Yeah.
Me and a girl and the guy that mugged us.
I'll bet you were a real Romeo in your younger days, weren't you, Fred?
Yeah.
I wish I knew then what I know now.
Wish I had now what I had then.
But I do pretty good with what I got left.
You certainly do.
- Yeah.
Donna?
- Yes, Fred.
I'm sure glad you left your coat at the house - and we could get together again.
- So am I, Fred.
After that last fight, I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Every time I looked at a piece of junk, I could see your face.
What does that mean?
It means I was thinking about you.
I just couldn't get you out of my mind.
I understand.
You know, we really never got to know each other.
- No, we didn't.
- We didn't give it no kind of chance.
It's like that song.
Gettin'to know you Gettin'to know all about you Gettin' to a movie every now and then is no way of gettin' to know anybody.
And I wasn't gettin' anywhere.
You know what I'm gettin' at?
Yes, Fred.
Fred, how do you think your son will react?
The last time he was very much against our getting married.
- Don't worry about him.
- Lamont's very attached to you and I don't want him to think I'm trying to shake you loose of him.
I've been a bachelor for over 20 years.
I'm ready to get shook.
- You'll have to tell him.
- I'll tell him.
- And what will you tell your friends?
- What do you mean?
You're young and pretty and got a nice figure and you're a good driver.
What will you tell 'em when they ask you what you see in me?
Why, I'll tell them that you're sweet and generous and handsome.
- You know that, don't you, Fred?
- Yeah, I know it but I like to hear it every now and then.
Oh, dear.
Look at the time.
- Time to go?
- I'm afraid so.
I have to be up early in the morning.
Well, before we go, I have something for you to make it official.
Oh, Fred.
A ring.
My engagement ring.
Well, it ain't yours yet, but it will be after I make 35 more payments.
- Oh, Fred, isn't that pretty?
- Beautiful.
See, you are sweet, just like I said.
What was that other thing you said I was?
- Generous?
- No, no.
- Handsome.
- That's the one.
Oh, Fred.
How can I ever thank you?
You could start by giving me one across the lips.
There ain't nothing good on after the fight, is there, Lamont?
Let's turn this thing off.
Ain't nothing on.
There's a horror movie on later, Melvin.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
The Creature With the Big Mouth.
"A prehistoric monster invades the city of Washington, D. C and eats up the United States Senate.
" Was that the one with Ann-Margret?
No.
This is with Lani Hiroshaki.
It was made in Japan.
They really know how to make those horror movies, thoseJapanese.
You know all those Godzilla movies?
They were all made in Japan.
I know that, Melvin.
I'm not exactly stupid, you know.
I wish they'd do a Godzilla movie with a black man, don't you?
I never really thought about it.
They couldn't have done it a few years ago.
But I'll bet it'd be all right to do it today.
Show a black man gettin' the best of the monster for a change.
I guess one of the reasons that we never seen that is 'cause they don't have too many black people over in Japan.
That's okay.
Send one over there.
Send Sammy Davis.
Make it Godzilla Meets Sammy Davis.
Sammy works everywhere.
Was that a car, Melvin?
That must be Pop coming home.
Hello, son.
Hello, Melvin.
Was that a car I just heard?
Did you get a ride home?
Uh-huh.
Donna Harris dropped me off.
You remember Donna Harris.
She was here a few weeks ago.
It was on again, off again.
- Now it's back on again.
- Oh, yeah.
Donna Harris.
- The practical nurse.
The barracuda.
- Don't call her that.
Where did you go, to the movies?
Did she massage the back of your neck again?
No, I went for a ride and yes, she did massage the back of my neck.
She can drive and do necks at the same time.
Pop, I don't understand you.
I thought that was all over with.
Well, son, I got to thinking.
Maybe we didn't give it a chance.
And you're really serious about this?
It's not just fun and games.
I'm serious, and I hope it leads to some fun 'cause I'm too old to be playin' games.
I'm gonna tell you like I told you the last time.
I think it's ridiculous, a man at your age gettin' married.
It's ridiculous, and I'm against it.
I guess I better be shovin' off.
You two wanna talk.
Wait, Melvin.
You can listen to this.
You like one of the family.
That's right.
Why don't you stay?
You got married a second time.
Tell us about those three exciting moments.
How you got engaged, how you got married and how you got divorced.
So what?
Melvin ain't no one-woman man.
He like to play the field.
And that's bad when you marry a woman who like to play the field also.
And the bleachers the grandstand the parking lot.
- Tell him.
- Don't do it, Fred.
I'm tellin' you, don't do it.
Just don't do it.
Tell him how ridiculous it is for a man at his age to be getting married.
Don't do it.
I'm gonna do it anyway.
Shucks.
I ain't listenin' to y'all.
It's nice to have a practical nurse around when you get my age.
Especially if something happens.
At your age, ain't nothin' much gonna happen.
I ain't paying neither one of you guys no mind.
I'm going in the kitchen and get me some applejack, make me sleep.
Remember what I said, Fred.
Don't do it.
Melvin, I think you said enough already.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, Lamont.
I wouldn't do it.
He shouldn't do it.
Remember what I said now, Fred.
I know.
I know.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Let me talk to you.
- Listen to me.
- Son, you want some applejack?
- Make you sleep.
- No, I don't want no applejack.
You ought to try some of this applejack.
It's almost all gone.
You better put applejack on the grocery list.
And get some mineral oil and Pluto Water.
And some prunes.
What do you need all that stuff for?
The applejack makes me sleep, and the other stuff make me get up.
Would you stop all this nonsense and listen to me.
What I'm trying to tell you is for your own good.
We got a good thing going.
Why do you wanna get married and mess it all up?
It ain't a bad thing to have a little female companionship around here and nice little silky things hanging in the bathroom.
You got companionship.
You got me and Melvin.
But y'all don't have no nice silky things hanging in the bathroom.
What about your age?
Who gets married at 65?
You better read your Bible.
Abraham got married when he was over a hundred.
- Had six kids.
- Abraham had some help from the Lord.
I don't intend to have no six children, so I won't need as much help.
Well, I can see it's not doing any good talking to you.
Nope.
It's too late.
I gave her an engagement ring tonight and made it official.
- What?
- That's right.
- You're really not kidding about this.
- I told you I wasn't kidding, didn't I?
All right.
I'm not gonna say another word about it.
Good.
If you wanna get married and mess up this home, just go ahead.
I'm going to.
I'm not gonna have another thing to say.
That's great.
Good night.
- Just remember one thing.
- What?
Two can play at this game.
- Just what does that mean?
- Well if you're gonna get married, I'm gonna get married.
- You get married?
- You don't think I can?
- I suppose you can.
- If somebody as old and ridiculous as you can find somebody, then so can I. For every man, there's a woman.
And for every dummy, there's a dummy.
Dummy.
Gettin'to know all about you Gettin'to like you Gettin'to know you like me What is that thing on your head?
- What's it look like?
- It looks likes gray crabgrass.
For your information, it's a hairpiece.
A lot of men wear 'em nowadays, so what's wrong with that?
You really are ridiculous.
Where did you get that thing from anyway?
You know Walter King?
His son works at a furrier, and they had some tails and paws laying around so he made this for me.
It's squirrel.
Well, be careful when you walk through the park with that thing on your head.
The squirrels are liable to drag you off with the rest of the nuts.
If you're gonna make fun of it, I ain't gonna even wear it.
Good.
What are you doing all dressed up?
You going out?
Not when there's somebody coming to cook dinner.
You remembered.
Donna's gonna be very happy about that.
She's a practical nurse, and she's neat and tidy.
And when she passes by, you can smell rubbing alcohol.
Sounds terrific.
Yeah, seem she cup her hands like this and you stick your nose in there and sniff real hard clear up your sinuses.
I can see a lot of interesting evenings ahead for you two, once you get married.
Trying on your squirrel hairpiece and sniffing her cupped hands.
When she gets here, you be nice to her.
Don't worry, Pop.
I'll be cool.
I know how you feel about her, but you don't have to call her "Mom.
" Just call her "Donna" or "Mrs. Harris.
" I'll think of something to call her.
Now, don't start that again.
- Don't do like you did the last time.
- What did I do?
You talked about age and stuff, and that's how we got in that fight.
You talked about her age, gray hairs and bags up under her eyes and varicose veins.
- Does she got varicose veins?
- No.
And don't look at her legs.
Is there anything else I shouldn't do?
Yeah.
Just don't talk about nothin'.
I'll be cool, Pop.
Don't worry.
There she is now.
- And remember what I told you.
- I know.
Don't talk about nothin'.
- Good evening, Fred.
Lamont.
- Good evening.
- It's nice to see you again, Lamont.
- Thank you very much.
- What you got there?
- Our dinner.
I prepared most of it at my place so as not to mess up your kitchen.
That was very thoughtful.
- Smells good.
What is it?
- Glazed ham and candied sweet potatoes.
I'll just take it in the kitchen and get started.
All right, darling.
- You get a whiff of that?
- It smells delicious.
Glazed ham and rubbing alcohol.
- Don't start that again.
- Don't worry, Pop.
I'll be cool.
I'll get this.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Sheila.
- Am I late?
- No, you're just fine.
Pop, this is Sheila Monroe.
Sheila, this is my father.
Hi, Pop.
Ooh, he's got that same Arabian look in the eye that you've got.
The sheik and the son of the sheik.
Yeah.
Say, sugar, I'd like to freshen up.
Where's the ladies' room?
If you mean the toilet, it's upstairs.
The bathroom is upstairs to your left.
Thanks.
He's cute.
I'll be right back.
The sheik Where did she come from?
Where did you meet her?
That's Sheila.
She came to cook dinner for me.
What are you talking about?
I told you Donna was coming over to cook dinner.
What do you think she's doing in the kitchen now?
She's in there cookin' your dinner.
Sheila is gonna cook mine.
What?
You know it's no good to have two women in the kitchen.
That's the way it's gonna be when we both get married, isn't it?
- Two women in the kitchen.
- You mean you're gonna marry her?
I might.
If you can get married so can I. - Where did you meet her?
- At a taco stand.
- A taco stand?
- That's right.
We were standing next to each other and the filling dropped out of her taco so I helped her stuff it back in.
Isn't that romantic?
Two dummy taco-stuffers.
I thought you got dressed up for Donna.
You didn't even tell me about this other girl.
Now that she's here, just watch what you say.
Here she come now, old dummy taco-stuffer.
Excuse me, Lamont.
If your last name is Sanford how come the monogram on your towel says "H.I."?
That's my middle name Holiday Inn.
- He's funny, Lamont.
- Yeah, he's a riot.
All right.
I'll just set the table.
- Hello.
- Hi, Mama.
What's happening?
Donna, this is Sheila.
She's a friend of Lamont.
- He invited her over here tonight.
- Oh.
Are you gonna have dinner with us?
I don't know.
L It's already prepared and there's so much.
Please join us.
Might as well.
We're gonna have some leftovers.
Might be better, Lamont.
I just had my nails done.
- And they're not quite dry.
- All right, all right.
Okay.
Good.
Sheila, come with me and help me get the other things.
Meantime, you gentlemen can get the chairs.
Come on.
I've got four false fingernails on.
That's some cook you got there.
I'm glad you didn't depend on her to fix dinner.
We'd have starved to death.
She would've cooked.
She just got talked out of it.
You told me yourself she couldn't even keep the stuffing in her taco.
- Sheila can cook anything.
- You mean she can defrost anything.
Here we are.
Lamont, Fred, please sit down.
Wow.
That sure smells good.
- It looks good.
- I sure hope it tastes good.
Sheila, can I help you?
Oh, yes, thank you.
Sure looks tasty.
Anybody mind if I smoke?
Well, if you're asking me, I'd rather you didn't.
Why don't you wait until we finished eatin'?
Why can't she smoke now if she wants to?
- 'Cause we eatin' now.
- Listen.
I don't have to smoke.
But mostly it's because it's bad for her lungs.
Well, they're her lungs.
But I don't want no bad lungs at my table.
Well, it's my table too.
- If you don't want me to, I won't.
- Go ahead and smoke.
Mr. Sanford, I don't have to smoke.
You heard what Donna said.
No smoking.
Just a minute.
She's not giving any orders at this table.
Don't you call her a "she.
" She's your future stepmother.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
You don't have anything to say about it.
- Yes, I do.
- Not after you get one across the lip.
Wait a minute.
You just can't come in here and tell me that.
I can tell you Fred, please, don't do that!
You Donna.
Donna, honey, what's the matter?
Fred, I will not be talked to that way by your son.
- We've got to clear this up right now.
- Listen.
He didn't mean no harm.
- Why didn't you smoke?
- I didn't think - everyone would get so uptight.
- Excuse me.
Who you gonna listen to, them or me?
- Don't be yellin' at me.
- Don't tell me not to yell at you.
- I told you to smoke!
- I don't care!
Will y'all be quiet!
Lamont, you owe Donna an apology.
Go in there and say something to her now.
- I'll say something to her all right.
- I don't wanna cause no problems.
- I put the cigarettes away.
- Don't you come here yelling at me.
- What is the matter with you?
- Excuse me.
Shut up!
I'm gettin' sick of this whole evening, you know that?
- Yeah, me too, and it's because of - You started all this trouble.
- Trouble?
I didn't do anything.
- It started with you wanting to smoke.
I'm supposed to be blamed for everything?
Yes, because whoever heard of putting all that poison in your system anyway?
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Shut up!
Shut up.
You sound like a bunch of clucking ducks.

You know, son maybe you were right when you said we shouldn't have two women in the kitchen.
Yeah.
That's true, Pop.
We can sit down together and have such a nice, quiet evening.
As soon as you add two women, everything changes.
- Every time, it happens, Pop.
- Something about their nature.
- Must be.
- They say men always start wars.
- Yeah.
- That funny?

{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Excuse me.
Are you the gentleman that left this card on my truck?
Yes.
I didn't see you around when I came home a little while ago.
I have an item in here I think you might be interested in.
Come in.
- What?
- What size shoe do you wear?
What size Nine and a half.
What's that got to do with anything?
Here.
Put these on.
I can't stay long.
I got to get back to work.
You don't understand.
It's the carpet.
It's antique Persian.
It's very valuable.
- So would you put these on, please?
- All right.
I don't know why I got to put on slippers for.
Not on that chair.
It's a Chippendale.
It's very valuable, very delicate.
Not on the wallpaper.
It's French.
Hand-blocked.
Very delicate.
I don't have time to play games.
If you got something to sell, bring it out here and let's get it over with.
You wait right here.
I'll bring you a chair.
What kind of nut is this?
Here you are.
Is it all right for me to step down in the slippers?
- Oh, yes, of course.
- I wouldn't wanna wear 'em out in case they're valuable and delicate.
Well, just don't brush up against anything and knock it over.
- Let's just forget about this.
I'll - You don't understand.
It's taken me a long time to collect all these things.
I'm just a little nervous about them.
You don't have to tell me that.
I'm a collector myself.
And where do you think I live, in a packing crate?
Well, excuse me.
Will you follow me?
Say, listen, are you sure it's me you wanna do business with?
We go in for antiques, sure, but mostly our business is junk.
I know.
But I want you to take this.
- What's the matter with it?
- There's nothing the matter with it.
- I just want it out of here.
- Why?
It looks great in this room.
I don't care what it looks like.
I want it out of here.
- It was my wife's.
- Did she die?
No.
Unfortunately.
She's no longer here.
I don't want anything of hers in here either.
- Well?
What do you say?
- What do I say?
- How much do you want for it?
- Nothing.
I just want it out of here.
- You mean for nothing?
- That's right.
Well, see I don't know about that.
If you were to call up a piano moving outfit they would charge you a pretty good penny to get this out of here.
But I'm letting you have it for nothing.
You can sell it.
You just try and sell a piano today.
Pianos are out.
You know what's in?
Guitars.
That's right.
Well, look I was reading an article in Ebony just today.
Do you read Ebony?
- No.
- Why not?
I read Life.
- Well, listen - I was reading this article in Ebony and it was going on to say that the guitar business in this country has shot sky high, but pianos, that's I'll give you ten dollars to take it away.
- You must be crazy.
- I'll give you 15.
Fifteen?
I got a partner.
How we gonna split 15 dollars?
I'll give you 20.
You don't want to do it for that, I'll get somebody else.
I'll take the 20.
I shouldn't 'cause I can get hurt on this job and I don't have any insurance.
Twenty dollars.
Take it or leave it.
I'll take it.
I'll have to go get my partner.
We'll be back this afternoon.
In the meantime, I don't want you to give that piano to anybody else.
- I won't.
- I'll see you later.
Say, listen, Lamont, me and you can't move no piano.
That's heavy work.
Besides, I got a sacroiliac.
Say, Pop, everybody's got a sacroiliac.
Yeah, but not like mine.
See, you wasn't in the war.
You wasn't wounded.
Are you gonna start that again?
What war were you ever in?
World War II.
I never got over it.
Staggering under that 40-pound pack.
You know you never left Fort Dix, New Jersey.
And the only pack that ever made you stagger was a six-pack.
How would you like one across your lip?
Do you wanna do this job or don't you?
If you do, stop talking.
- If you don't, we'll just go home.
- I'll do it.
Although it'll hurt my back, I'll do it.
It's gonna hurt my back, but I'll do it.
I don't care if it does hurt my back.
I'll do it.
Well, we're back.
This is my partner.
Come in.
Do you think you'll be able to manage?
He looks a little old to be doing heavy work like moving a piano.
That's what I tried to tell him.
Don't worry.
I'll take most of the strain.
See, it's my back.
Hasn't been the same since the war.
- You were in the war.
- Yeah, the big one.
World War II.
Paratrooper.
Jump behind German lines.
But I don't wanna talk about it.
Do you know you're right?
I've been telling him that all day.
- My son don't like to hear war stories.
- Son?
You brought your father to help?
I already told you that I'm gonna do most of the lifting.
It's none of my business, but shouldn't he be retired?
You'd think so after all I did for my country and my son.
Why do you make him work like this?
That's all right.
I won't be doing it much longer.
Any day now I'll be going to join my wife Elizabeth.
- Would you stop that.
- See, it's Sanford and Son now.
But when I'm gone, the business will all be his alone.
It'll be Dummy, Incorporated.
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about Dummy, Incorporated?
I brought you up here to move this piano.
This man doesn't need to know anything about our personal business.
Gentlemen!
I don't want any scenes here.
- Are you up to the job or aren't you?
- I told you we could.
Let us do it.
- All right.
- Come on, Pop.
Let get this thing.
- Oh, yeah.
- What's the matter?
What size shoe do you wear?
Go on.
Tell him what size shoe you wear.
I wear a ten.
What we gonna do, dance?
It's the carpet.
It's antique.
With those heavy boots, you wouldn't want to walk on an old Persian carpet.
With these heavy boots, I'll walk on a old Persian.
Here.
Sorry.
This is all I have in size ten.
Who wore these last, the thief of Baghdad?
I don't know how you find these people.
- It's the chair.
- It's a Chippendale.
Not for sitting.
You ought to get a Sears Roebuck.
They're made for sittin'.
The wallpaper.
It's French.
Very delicate.
You stay right here.
I'll be right back.
What's he doing with all these slippers around here?
He don't want nobody to walk on his old rugs.
You know what I think?
I think he's a fruitcake.
Or maybe just a plain fruit.
Would you stop it.
What's he doing home this time of day in that fruity robe?
- I don't know.
What do I care?
- 'Cause he's fruity.
Where's his wife?
I already told you, Pop, they're separated.
And you know why?
His guests don't have to worry about where they gonna lean or sit or walk.
They just fly around the room.
Listen to me.
I don't care anything about this man's personal life.
We're here to move a piano.
Well, you just keep an eye on him and watch his shoulders.
That's how you can tell.
Watch his shoulders.
- Here you are.
- See that?
- See?
See what?
- Nothing.
I was talking to him.
Would you like some help?
- No, I don't want no help.
- Well, I'll leave you two alone.
If you need anything, you just call me.
Say, listen.
Just a moment.
- Will your wife be coming around today?
- My wife and I are separated.
Wait a minute.
Come here.
What happened between you two?
I don't think that concerns you.
One more question.
The reason why I asked you 'cause a lot of people get separated nowadays.
I just wanted to know what the reason was.
Excuse my father.
He's got a habit of poking his nose in people's business.
If you really must know, our marriage wasn't working, so we separated.
Now I have a whole new way of life which I prefer.
Is that all right?
That's what I wanna ask you about.
Come here.
That's what I wanna ask you, about that whole new way of life.
What's the matter with you?
What are you asking people personal questions for?
- That's embarrassing.
- We better get on out of here 'cause this place might get raided.
Because I'm tellin' ya, that guy is What are you worried about?
If this place gets raided while we're here all we have to do is tell 'em that we came to move a piano.
In these?
We got a job to do.
Let's just do it and get it over with.
- Hey, Lamont.
- Huh?
This is a nice apartment here.
I wonder how much the rent is.
What difference does it make?
You could never live here.
Supreme Court said I could live anywhere I want to.
Yeah, well, you better get the Supreme Court to pay your rent.
Come on over here and let's get this started.
- Look here.
Here's his checkbook.
- Would you put that back.
Look here.
$320 to Mrs. Martinson.
- That must've been his wife.
- Pop, put that down.
And $100 to Duane Hudson.
I bet I know who Duane is.
Get away from there.
Just get - Are you looking for something?
- No.
I was just putting Come on, son.
We got to move this piano over here.
Well, your father seems willing to work.
Yeah.
I always say if you got a job to do, do it and get it over with.
Exactly.
Too bad the young people today don't understand any of that.
- Yeah.
You got any kids?
- No.
I didn't think so.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Oh, hello, darling.
I want to take this in the other room.
Will you hang it up for me, please?
I speak all that.
I learned that overseas in the army.
You double-crossing old What are you doing?
- Would you put Get away from here.
- Hush.
Give me this phone.
- What's the matter with you?
- Did you hear him say "darling"?
I can swear it was a man's voice on the other end.
Are you gonna get started on this job or not?
All right.
Okay.
I bet that was Duane on the phone.
Hey, Lamont, look here.
This is the kind of cigarette they smoke.
Would you put that down.
"My goodness.
" I'd sure would like to be here Saturday night when Duane and all the rest of the guests be around here smoking these cigarettes and sittin' around in their slippers.
"Oh, my goodness.
" "Excuse me.
How long have you been doing manual labor"?
- Put that down and get over here.
- Okay.
- Can't take a minute out for a few - What's the matter with you?
Well, what do you think?
I ain't lifting this.
What do you mean, you're not lifting this?
I ain't gonna rupture myself for no ten bucks.
Pop, don't you understand?
We're not just getting ten dollars.
The man is giving us a Steinway.
The man is giving us a hernia.
- You wanna quit?
- How you gonna lift it?
All we got to do is push it.
It's on rollers.
Just watch.
Just get down here, try to get this - Now what are you doing?
- Excuse me.
I didn't know you were still talking on the phone.
- What was that for?
- He's still talking to Duane.
Get over here.
Stay away from that phone.
- We got to move this piano.
- What do you want me to do?
Yes?
Was there something you wanted?
I was just wondering could you give me a drink of something.
Well, how about a glass of milk?
Milk.
No.
That's too heavy.
My bayonet wound in the infantry.
Infantry?
I thought you said you were in the paratroopers.
That's true.
When I jumped, I landed on a guy who was in the infantry and he had his bayonet out.
Oh.
I see.
Make it a beer or gin.
Beer.
Brandy.
That's what the old army doctor used to always say beer when it's near, brandy when it's handy.
- I'll see which I have.
- Beer or brandy or vodka or bourbon.
Rum.
Tequila.
You get more ridiculous by the minute.
Listen.
This is what we're gonna do.
I'll lift the piano and all you have to do is get underneath it and pull out the carpet.
You can't lift no piano.
I can lift it long enough for you to pull out the carpet.
Just get down there.
Is that asking too much?
- No, no.
- Get down there.
I'll lift the piano.
You lift it up and I'll pull the rug out.
- Don't let him do that.
- What?
Don't let him make you lift that heavy piano.
That's ridiculous.
Here.
Have some brandy.
I bet you can use it.
I sure can.
Thank you.
Here's to you, son.
Listen.
You better cut that out.
You just better cut it out.
- You're making me look like a heel.
- What did I do?
It's what you've been doing ever since we came in here.
You've been lying and snooping around and trying to make me out to be a rat.
- I want you to stop it.
- I didn't do nothin' like that.
Now what's going on?
What's he doing to you?
Is he threatening you?
- Everything's all right.
- It's not all right.
I don't like the way you treat your father.
In fact, I don't like your attitude.
You better go.
I'm gonna get somebody else.
Wait.
Don't do that now.
He just loses his temper every now and then.
But he don't mean it.
Besides, we need the job.
Oh.
Well, all right, for your sake.
I'm doing it for his sake only.
You don't realize what a nice old gentleman your father is.
He served in the army.
Worked hard.
Why, he was even wounded at the front.
Yeah, and in the stomach.
If you need anything, you just call me.
I don't wanna talk to you.
I don't wanna say nothing to you.
I don't wanna hear it.
Just move this piano.
Just move out of the way.
- I'll do it myself.
- You gonna take on a job like That's it.
Lift it on this end and kick it with your foot.
Come on.
Kick it.
There you go.
Now move around over here somewhere.
That's it, son.
It's not too heavy.
Just lift it on up there and kick it with your left No.
Push down when you kick it.
There you go.
When you get this one over here, I'll pull the rug out.
There you go.
You got it?
Easy now.
Don't drop it.
There you go.
I wonder why he didn't come in then.
He always comes in here when it looks like you're doing all the work.
Well, what we gonna do now?
As soon as I rest a little bit we're gonna push it over there by the door 'cause it'll roll now.
- It'll roll?
- Yeah.
Let me see if it'll roll.
Should be easier if it'll roll.
Oh, yeah.
That's much nicer.
I can almost do this by myself.
- Well, you did it again.
- Did what?
Nothing.
Just get help me over to the door.
We ain't never gonna get this piano through the door.
It'll get through there.
How do you think they got it in?
You think they built the apartment around it?
- Watch that rug there.
- Listen.
Anything that goes up, comes down.
Anything that goes in, goes out.
That's the first rule of physics.
- First rule of physics.
- That's right.
You don't know that much.
- Wait a minute, Pop.
- You see And the second rule of physics it's stuck.
I didn't mean to try to get it through this way.
Listen.
Pull it back.
- Push it.
- I meant to bring it over here turn it on its side and get it through sideways.
I told you once before.
I ain't lifting this piano.
You don't have to lift it.
You just come over here turn it on its side, and we'll wiggle it through.
- Okay, but - You're certainly taking a long time getting this out of here.
Yes, we're certainly taking a long time getting this out of here.
If I'd known you were going to take that long, I wouldn't have Hello.
Oh, hello, darling.
I can't talk very long.
I have some people here - and they're moving Sylvia's piano out.
- Will you wiggle it.
That'll be the last of Sylvia.
What she ever needed a piano for, I'll never know.
She never got past "Chopsticks.
" That's it.
Twist it.
Turn it.
Now, wiggle it.
Push it.
Wait.
Look, Lamont.
I pushed it and wiggled it and twist it.
What am I gonna do next, the funky chicken?
Stop trying to be so funny and just push this thing in here.
- It came in here.
It's got to come out.
- It ain't gonna make it.
- You'll never get it through the door.
- That's what I just told him.
- What are you gonna do?
- We're gonna have to take the legs off.
- The legs don't come off.
- How did they get the dumb thing in?
How would I know?
I'm not a piano mover.
- Me either.
- You shouldn't have taken the job.
That's what I told him.
I had to bring it over here to find out if we'll get through the door.
Otherwise, how would I know?
It'll come out of here because it came in here.
Is that your truck parked out in front?
- Yes, it is, officer.
- You better get it out of there.
You're in a ten-minute loading zone, and you've been there for half an hour.
Well Okay, as soon as I move the piano.
Now.
If you don't get it out of there right now, I'm gonna write you a ticket.
- After that, I'm gonna have it towed.
- Listen.
I have to move this piano.
Look, first the truck and then the piano.
Okay?
Okay.
You heard what he said.
Let's go downstairs and move the truck.
- You can't leave now.
- You heard what that policeman said.
I don't care what he said.
I demand you finish the job.
Listen.
I'm sick of you and this job and this piano.
Let's get out of here, Pop.
- Excuse me.
- What am I supposed to do?
Come on.
Come on.
Pull it back in.
Who?
Who, me?
Pull it back in by myself?
With my bayonet wound?
Are you crazy?
What am I supposed to do?
I have guests coming.
Get some of your guests to help you.
I'll sue you.
I'll sue you both.
I'm gonna call my attorney right now.
Samson and Son.
That's it, isn't it?
No, it's Samson and Delilah.
I'm Samson.
We got a piano that belongs to us stuck in the door and that guy's never gonna give us that 20 bucks.
- What are we gonna do now?
- We'll do like they did in the Bible.
You know, Moses was being chased by the Egyptians.
And he came upon the Red Sea and he stuck his arms out over the sea and the sea divided.
- So we gonna do like Moses?
- No, we gonna do like the Red Sea.
- We're gonna split.
- I'm with you.
- Say, Lamont.
- Huh?
You know that guy up there?
He was really fruity.
Stop that, Pop.
- Right.
He could've been a Nazi.
- What are you talking about?
Did you notice when I mentioned the war, he started talking German?
That's right.
You know, Hitler wasn't too cool.
Everybody said he was You remember that salute?
"Hi, Hitler.
" - Come on.
Let's get out of here.
- Okay, but Hey, Lamont.
- Look.
- Oh, no.
We left our shoes up there.
And I just had my heels fixed.
- You wanna go back up there?
- I don't think so.
That guy will only make more trouble for us.
You mind wearing them?
- I don't mind.
- Let's go.
Coming, Delilah.
